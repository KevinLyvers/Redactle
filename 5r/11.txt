analytic, philosophy, is, an, analysis, focused, broad, contemporary, movement, or, tradition, within, western, philosophy, especially, anglophone, philosophy, analytic, philosophy, is, characterized, by, a, clarity, of, prose, rigor, in, arguments, and, making, use, of, formal, logic, and, mathematics, and, to, a, lesser, degree, the, natural, sciences, it, is, further, characterized, by, an, interest, in, language, and, meaning, known, as, the, linguistic, turn, it, has, developed, several, new, branches, of, philosophy, and, logic, notably, philosophy, of, language, philosophy, of, mathematics, philosophy, of, science, modern, predicate, logic, and, mathematical, logic, the, proliferation, of, analysis, in, philosophy, began, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, has, been, dominant, since, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, central, figures, in, its, historical, development, are, gottlob, frege, bertrand, russell, g, e, moore, and, ludwig, wittgenstein, other, important, figures, in, its, history, include, franz, brentano, the, logical, positivists, particularly, rudolf, carnap, the, ordinary, language, philosophers, w, v, o, quine, and, karl, popper, after, the, decline, of, logical, positivism, saul, kripke, david, lewis, and, others, led, a, revival, in, metaphysics, analytic, philosophy, is, often, contrasted, with, continental, philosophy, which, was, coined, as, a, catch, all, term, for, other, methods, that, were, prominent, in, continental, europe, most, notably, existentialism, phenomenology, and, hegelianism, there, is, widespread, influence, and, debate, between, the, analytic, and, continental, traditions, some, philosophers, see, the, differences, between, the, two, traditions, as, being, based, on, institutions, relationships, and, ideology, rather, than, anything, of, significant, philosophical, substance, the, distinction, has, also, been, drawn, between, analytic, being, academic, or, technical, philosophy, and, continental, being, literary, philosophy, analytic, philosophy, was, deeply, influenced, by, what, is, called, austrian, realism, in, the, former, state, of, austria, hungary, so, much, so, that, michael, dummett, has, remarked, that, analytic, philosophy, is, better, characterized, as, anglo, austrian, rather, than, the, usual, anglo, american, university, of, vienna, philosopher, and, psychologist, franz, brentano, in, psychology, from, an, empirical, standpoint, 1874, and, through, the, subsequent, influence, of, the, school, of, brentano, and, its, members, such, as, edmund, husserl, and, alexius, meinong, gave, to, analytic, philosophy, the, problem, of, intentionality, or, of, aboutness, for, brentano, all, mental, events, have, a, real, non, mental, intentional, object, which, the, thinking, is, directed, at, or, about, meinong, is, known, for, his, unique, ontology, of, real, nonexistent, objects, as, a, solution, to, the, problem, of, empty, names, the, graz, school, followed, meinong, the, polish, lw, w, warsaw, school, founded, by, kazimierz, twardowski, in, 1895, grew, as, an, offshoot, of, the, graz, school, it, was, closely, associated, with, the, warsaw, school, of, mathematics, gottlob, frege, 1848, 1925, was, a, german, geometry, professor, at, the, university, of, jena, who, is, understood, as, the, father, of, analytic, philosophy, frege, proved, influential, as, a, philosopher, of, mathematics, in, germany, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, he, advocated, logicism, the, project, of, reducing, arithmetic, to, pure, logic, as, a, result, of, his, logicist, project, frege, developed, predicate, logic, in, his, book, begriffsschrift, english, concept, script, 1879, which, allowed, for, a, much, greater, range, of, sentences, to, be, parsed, into, logical, form, than, was, possible, using, the, ancient, aristotelian, logic, an, example, of, this, is, the, problem, of, multiple, generality, neo, kantianism, dominated, the, late, 19th, century, in, german, philosophy, edmund, husserl, s, 1891, book, philosophie, der, arithmetik, argued, that, the, concept, of, the, cardinal, number, derived, from, psychical, acts, of, grouping, objects, and, counting, them, in, contrast, to, this, psychologism, frege, in, the, foundations, of, arithmetic, 1884, and, the, basic, laws, of, arithmetic, german, grundgesetze, der, arithmetik, 1893, 1903, argued, similarly, to, plato, or, bolzano, that, mathematics, and, logic, have, their, own, public, objects, independent, of, the, private, judgments, or, mental, states, of, individual, mathematicians, and, logicians, following, frege, the, logicists, tended, to, advocate, a, kind, of, mathematical, platonism, frege, also, proved, influential, in, the, philosophy, of, language, and, analytic, philosophy, s, interest, in, meaning, michael, dummett, traces, the, linguistic, turn, to, frege, s, foundations, of, arithmetic, and, his, context, principle, frege, s, paper, on, sense, and, reference, 1892, is, seminal, containing, frege, s, puzzles, and, providing, a, mediated, reference, theory, his, paper, the, thought, a, logical, inquiry, 1918, reflects, both, his, anti, idealism, or, anti, psychologism, and, his, interest, in, language, in, the, paper, he, argues, for, a, platonist, account, of, propositions, or, thoughts, british, philosophy, in, the, 19th, century, had, seen, a, revival, of, logic, started, by, richard, whately, in, reaction, to, the, anti, logical, tradition, of, british, empiricism, the, major, figure, of, this, period, is, english, mathematician, george, boole, other, figures, include, william, hamilton, augustus, de, morgan, william, stanley, jevons, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, author, lewis, carroll, hugh, maccoll, and, american, pragmatist, charles, sanders, peirce, british, philosophy, in, the, late, 19th, century, was, dominated, by, british, idealism, a, neo, hegelian, movement, as, taught, by, philosophers, such, as, f, h, bradley, 1846, 1924, and, t, h, green, 1836, 1882, analytic, philosophy, in, the, narrower, sense, of, 20th, and, 21st, century, anglophone, philosophy, is, usually, thought, to, begin, with, cambridge, philosophers, bertrand, russell, and, g, e, moore, s, rejection, of, hegelianism, for, being, obscure, or, the, revolt, against, idealism, see, for, example, moore, s, a, defence, of, common, sense, russell, summed, up, moore, s, influence, g, e, moore, took, the, lead, in, rebellion, and, i, followed, with, a, sense, of, emancipation, bradley, had, argued, that, everything, common, sense, believes, in, is, mere, appearance, we, reverted, to, the, opposite, extreme, and, that, everything, is, real, that, common, sense, uninfluenced, by, philosophy, of, theology, supposes, real, with, a, sense, of, escaping, from, prison, we, allowed, ourselves, to, think, that, grass, is, green, that, the, sun, and, stars, would, exist, if, no, one, was, aware, of, them, and, also, that, there, is, a, pluralistic, timeless, world, of, platonic, ideas, bertrand, russell, during, his, early, career, was, much, influenced, by, frege, russell, famously, discovered, the, paradox, in, basic, law, v, which, undermined, frege, s, logicist, project, however, like, frege, russell, argued, that, mathematics, is, reducible, to, logical, fundamentals, in, the, principles, of, mathematics, 1903, he, also, argued, for, meinongianism, russell, sought, to, resolve, various, philosophical, problems, by, applying, frege, s, new, logical, apparatus, most, famously, in, his, theory, of, definite, descriptions, in, on, denoting, published, in, mind, in, 1905, russell, here, argues, against, meinongianism, he, argues, all, names, aside, from, demonstratives, like, this, or, that, are, disguised, definite, descriptions, using, this, to, solve, ascriptions, of, nonexistence, this, position, came, to, be, called, descriptivism, later, his, book, written, with, alfred, north, whitehead, principia, mathematica, 1910, 1913, the, seminal, text, of, classical, logic, and, of, the, logicist, project, encouraged, many, philosophers, to, renew, their, interest, in, the, development, of, symbolic, logic, it, used, a, notation, from, italian, logician, giuseppe, peano, and, it, uses, a, theory, of, types, to, avoid, the, pitfalls, of, russell, s, paradox, whitehead, developed, process, metaphysics, in, process, and, reality, additionally, russell, adopted, frege, s, predicate, logic, as, his, primary, philosophical, method, a, method, russell, thought, could, expose, the, underlying, structure, of, philosophical, problems, logical, form, would, be, made, clear, by, syntax, for, example, the, english, word, is, has, three, distinct, meanings, which, predicate, logic, can, express, as, follows, from, about, 1910, to, 1930, analytic, philosophers, like, frege, russell, moore, and, russell, s, student, ludwig, wittgenstein, emphasized, creating, an, ideal, language, for, philosophical, analysis, which, would, be, free, from, the, ambiguities, of, ordinary, language, that, in, their, opinion, often, made, philosophy, invalid, during, this, phase, they, sought, to, understand, language, and, hence, philosophical, problems, by, using, logic, to, formalize, how, philosophical, statements, are, made, an, important, aspect, of, hegelianism, and, british, idealism, was, logical, holism, the, opinion, that, there, are, aspects, of, the, world, that, can, be, known, only, by, knowing, the, whole, world, this, is, closely, related, to, the, doctrine, of, internal, relations, the, opinion, that, relations, between, items, are, internal, relations, that, is, essential, properties, of, the, nature, of, those, items, russell, and, moore, in, response, promulgated, logical, atomism, and, the, doctrine, of, external, relations, the, belief, that, the, world, consists, of, independent, facts, inspired, by, developments, in, modern, formal, logic, the, early, russell, claimed, that, the, problems, of, philosophy, can, be, solved, by, showing, the, simple, constituents, of, complex, notions, wittgenstein, developed, a, comprehensive, system, of, logical, atomism, with, a, picture, theory, of, meaning, in, his, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, german, logisch, philosophische, abhandlung, 1921, sometimes, known, as, simply, the, tractatus, he, claimed, the, universe, is, the, totality, of, actual, states, of, affairs, and, that, these, states, of, affairs, can, be, expressed, and, mirrored, by, the, language, of, first, order, predicate, logic, thus, a, picture, of, the, universe, can, be, constructed, by, expressing, facts, in, the, form, of, atomic, propositions, and, linking, them, using, logical, operators, wittgenstein, thought, he, had, solved, all, the, problems, of, philosophy, with, the, tractatus, the, work, further, ultimately, concludes, that, all, of, its, propositions, are, meaningless, illustrated, with, a, ladder, one, must, toss, away, after, climbing, up, it, during, the, late, 1920s, to, 1940s, a, group, of, philosophers, known, as, the, vienna, circle, and, another, one, known, as, the, berlin, circle, developed, russell, and, wittgenstein, s, philosophy, into, a, doctrine, known, as, logical, positivism, or, logical, empiricism, the, vienna, circle, was, led, by, moritz, schlick, and, included, rudolf, carnap, and, otto, neurath, the, berlin, circle, was, led, by, hans, reichenbach, and, included, carl, hempel, and, mathematician, david, hilbert, logical, positivists, used, formal, logical, methods, to, develop, an, empiricist, account, of, knowledge, they, adopted, the, verification, principle, according, to, which, every, meaningful, statement, is, either, analytic, or, synthetic, the, truths, of, logic, and, mathematics, were, tautologies, and, those, of, science, were, verifiable, empirical, claims, these, two, constituted, the, entire, universe, of, meaningful, judgments, anything, else, was, nonsense, this, led, the, logical, positivists, to, reject, many, traditional, problems, of, philosophy, especially, those, of, metaphysics, as, meaningless, it, had, the, additional, effect, of, making, ethical, and, aesthetic, value, judgments, as, well, as, religious, statements, and, beliefs, meaningless, logical, positivists, therefore, typically, considered, philosophy, as, having, a, minimal, function, for, them, philosophy, concerned, the, clarification, of, thoughts, rather, than, having, a, distinct, subject, matter, of, its, own, several, logical, positivists, were, jewish, such, as, neurath, hans, hahn, philipp, frank, friedrich, waissmann, and, reichenbach, others, like, carnap, were, gentiles, but, socialists, or, pacifists, with, the, coming, to, power, of, adolf, hitler, and, nazism, in, 1933, many, members, of, the, vienna, and, berlin, circles, fled, to, britain, and, the, united, states, which, helped, to, reinforce, the, dominance, of, logical, positivism, and, analytic, philosophy, in, anglophone, countries, in, 1936, schlick, was, murdered, in, vienna, by, his, former, student, hans, nelb, ck, the, same, year, a, j, ayer, s, work, language, truth, and, logic, introduced, the, english, speaking, world, to, logical, positivism, the, logical, positivists, saw, their, rejection, of, metaphysics, in, some, ways, as, a, recapitulation, of, a, quote, by, david, hume, if, we, take, in, our, hand, any, volume, of, divinity, or, school, metaphysics, for, instance, let, us, ask, does, it, contain, any, abstract, reasoning, concerning, quantity, or, number, no, does, it, contain, any, experimental, reasoning, concerning, matter, of, fact, and, existence, no, commit, it, then, to, the, flames, for, it, can, contain, nothing, but, sophistry, and, illusion, after, world, war, ii, from, the, late, 1940s, to, the, 1950s, analytic, philosophy, became, involved, with, ordinary, language, analysis, this, resulted, in, two, main, trends, one, strain, of, language, analysis, continued, wittgenstein, s, later, philosophy, from, the, philosophical, investigations, 1953, which, differed, dramatically, from, his, early, work, of, the, tractatus, the, criticisms, of, frank, p, ramsey, on, color, and, logical, form, in, the, tractatus, led, to, some, of, wittgenstein, s, first, doubts, with, regard, to, his, early, philosophy, philosophers, refer, to, them, like, two, different, philosophers, early, wittgenstein, and, later, wittgenstein, in, his, later, philosophy, wittgenstein, develops, the, concept, of, a, language, game, and, rather, than, his, prior, picture, theory, of, meaning, advocates, a, theory, of, meaning, as, use, it, also, contains, the, private, language, argument, and, the, notion, of, family, resemblance, the, other, trend, was, known, as, oxford, philosophy, in, contrast, to, earlier, analytic, cambridge, philosophers, including, the, early, wittgenstein, who, thought, philosophers, should, avoid, the, deceptive, trappings, of, natural, language, by, constructing, ideal, languages, influenced, by, moore, s, common, sense, and, what, they, perceived, as, the, later, wittgenstein, s, quietism, the, oxford, philosophers, claimed, that, ordinary, language, already, represents, many, subtle, distinctions, not, recognized, in, the, formulation, of, traditional, philosophical, theories, or, problems, while, schools, such, as, logical, positivism, emphasize, logical, terms, which, are, supposed, to, be, universal, and, separate, from, contingent, factors, such, as, culture, language, historical, conditions, ordinary, language, philosophy, emphasizes, the, use, of, language, by, ordinary, people, the, most, prominent, ordinary, language, philosophers, during, the, 1950s, were, p, f, strawson, j, l, austin, and, gilbert, ryle, ordinary, language, philosophers, often, sought, to, resolve, philosophical, problems, by, showing, them, to, be, the, result, of, misunderstanding, ordinary, language, ryle, in, the, concept, of, mind, 1949, criticized, cartesian, dualism, arguing, in, favor, of, disposing, of, descartes, myth, via, recognizing, category, errors, strawson, first, became, well, known, with, his, article, on, referring, 1950, a, criticism, of, russell, s, theory, of, descriptions, explained, in, the, latter, s, famous, on, denoting, article, in, his, book, individuals, 1959, strawson, examines, our, conceptions, of, basic, particulars, austin, in, the, posthumously, published, how, to, do, things, with, words, 1962, emphasized, the, theory, of, speech, acts, and, the, ability, of, words, to, do, things, e, g, i, promise, and, not, just, say, things, this, influenced, several, fields, to, undertake, what, is, called, a, performative, turn, in, sense, and, sensibilia, 1962, austin, criticized, sense, data, theories, the, school, known, as, australian, realism, began, when, john, anderson, accepted, the, challis, chair, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, sydney, in, 1927, his, elder, brother, was, william, anderson, professor, of, philosophy, at, auckland, university, college, from, 1921, to, his, death, in, 1955, who, was, described, as, the, most, dominant, figure, in, new, zealand, philosophy, j, n, findlay, was, a, student, of, ernst, mally, of, the, austrian, realists, and, taught, at, the, university, of, otago, the, finnish, georg, henrik, von, wright, succeeded, wittgenstein, at, cambridge, in, 1948, one, striking, difference, with, respect, to, early, analytic, philosophy, was, the, revival, of, metaphysical, theorizing, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, metaphysics, remains, a, fertile, topic, of, research, although, many, discussions, are, continuations, of, old, ones, from, previous, decades, and, centuries, the, debates, remains, active, the, rise, of, metaphysics, mirrored, the, decline, of, logical, positivism, first, challenged, by, the, later, wittgenstein, wilfred, sellars, s, criticism, of, the, myth, of, the, given, in, empiricism, and, the, philosophy, of, mind, 1956, challenged, logical, positivism, by, arguing, against, sense, data, theories, in, his, philosophy, and, the, scientific, image, of, man, 1962, sellars, distinguishes, between, the, manifest, image, and, the, scientific, image, of, the, world, sellars, s, goal, of, a, synoptic, philosophy, that, unites, the, everyday, and, scientific, views, of, reality, is, the, foundation, and, archetype, of, what, is, sometimes, called, the, pittsburgh, school, whose, members, include, robert, brandom, john, mcdowell, and, john, haugeland, also, among, the, developments, that, resulted, in, the, decline, of, logical, positivism, and, the, revival, of, metaphysical, theorizing, was, harvard, philosopher, w, v, o, quine, s, attack, on, the, analytic, synthetic, distinction, in, two, dogmas, of, empiricism, published, in, 1951, in, the, philosophical, review, and, republished, in, quine, s, book, from, a, logical, point, of, view, 1953, a, paper, sometimes, regarded, as, the, most, important, in, all, of, twentieth, century, philosophy, from, a, logical, point, of, view, also, contains, quine, s, essay, on, what, there, is, 1948, which, elucidates, russell, s, theory, of, descriptions, and, contains, quine, s, famous, dictum, of, ontological, commitment, to, be, is, to, be, the, value, of, a, variable, he, also, dubbed, the, problem, of, nonexistence, plato, s, beard, quine, sought, to, naturalize, philosophy, and, saw, philosophy, as, continuous, with, science, but, instead, of, logical, positivism, advocated, a, kind, of, semantic, holism, and, ontological, relativity, which, explained, that, every, term, in, any, statement, has, its, meaning, contingent, on, a, vast, network, of, knowledge, and, belief, the, speaker, s, conception, of, the, entire, world, in, his, magnum, opus, word, and, object, 1960, quine, introduces, the, idea, of, radical, translation, an, introduction, to, his, theory, of, the, indeterminacy, of, translation, and, specifically, to, prove, the, inscrutability, of, reference, important, also, for, the, revival, of, metaphysics, was, the, further, development, of, modal, logic, first, introduced, by, pragmatist, c, i, lewis, especially, the, work, of, saul, kripke, and, his, naming, and, necessity, 1980, according, to, one, author, naming, and, necessity, played, a, large, role, in, the, implicit, but, widespread, rejection, of, the, view, so, popular, among, ordinary, language, philosophers, that, philosophy, is, nothing, more, than, the, analysis, of, language, kripke, was, influential, in, arguing, that, flaws, in, common, theories, of, descriptions, and, proper, names, are, indicative, of, larger, misunderstandings, of, the, metaphysics, of, necessity, and, possibility, kripke, also, argued, that, necessity, is, a, metaphysical, notion, distinct, from, the, epistemic, notion, of, a, priori, and, that, there, are, necessary, truths, that, are, known, a, posteriori, such, as, that, water, is, h, 2, o, kripke, is, widely, regarded, as, having, revived, theories, of, essence, and, identity, as, respectable, topics, of, philosophical, discussion, kripke, and, hilary, putnam, argued, for, realism, about, natural, kinds, kripke, holds, that, it, is, essential, that, water, is, h, 2, o, or, for, gold, to, be, atomic, number, 79, putnam, s, twin, earth, thought, experiment, can, be, used, to, illustrate, the, same, point, with, water, american, philosopher, david, lewis, defended, a, number, of, elaborate, metaphysical, theories, in, works, such, as, on, the, plurality, of, worlds, 1986, and, counterfactuals, 1973, he, argued, for, modal, realism, and, counterpart, theory, the, belief, in, real, concrete, possible, worlds, according, to, lewis, actual, is, merely, an, indexical, label, we, give, a, world, when, we, are, in, it, lewis, also, defended, what, he, called, humean, supervenience, a, counterfactual, theory, of, causation, and, contributed, to, abstract, object, theory, he, became, closely, associated, with, australia, whose, philosophical, community, he, visited, almost, annually, for, more, than, 30, years, in, response, to, the, problem, of, universals, australian, david, malet, armstrong, defended, a, kind, of, moderate, realism, quine, and, lewis, defended, nominalism, polish, philosopher, stanis, aw, le, niewski, coined, the, term, mereology, which, is, the, formal, study, of, parts, and, wholes, a, subject, that, arguably, goes, back, to, the, time, of, the, pre, socratics, david, lewis, believed, in, perdurantism, and, introduced, the, term, gunk, peter, van, inwagen, believes, in, mereological, nihilism, except, for, living, beings, a, view, called, organicism, peter, van, inwagen, s, 1983, monograph, an, essay, on, free, will, played, an, important, role, in, rehabilitating, libertarianism, with, respect, to, free, will, in, mainstream, analytical, philosophy, in, the, book, he, introduces, the, consequence, argument, and, the, term, incompatibilism, about, free, will, and, determinism, to, stand, in, contrast, to, compatibilism, the, view, that, free, will, is, compatible, with, determinism, charlie, broad, had, previously, made, similar, arguments, since, john, locke, philosophers, have, been, concerned, with, the, problem, of, personal, identity, derek, parfit, in, reasons, and, persons, 1984, defends, a, kind, of, bundle, theory, while, david, lewis, again, defends, perdurantism, bernard, williams, in, the, self, and, the, future, 1970, argues, that, personal, identity, is, bodily, identity, rather, than, mental, continuity, since, leibniz, philosophers, have, discussed, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, or, psr, van, inwagen, criticizes, the, psr, alexander, pruss, defends, it, analytic, philosophy, of, time, traces, its, roots, to, the, british, idealist, j, m, e, mctaggart, s, article, the, unreality, of, time, 1908, in, it, mctaggart, distinguishes, between, the, dynamic, a, or, tensed, theory, of, time, past, present, future, in, which, time, flows, and, the, static, or, tenseless, b, theory, of, time, earlier, than, simultaneous, with, later, than, eternalism, holds, that, past, present, and, future, are, equally, real, in, contrast, presentism, holds, that, only, entities, in, the, present, exist, the, theory, of, special, relativity, seems, to, advocate, a, b, theory, of, time, david, lewis, s, perdurantism, or, four, dimensionalism, requires, a, b, theory, of, time, a, n, prior, who, invented, tense, logic, advocated, the, a, theory, of, time, many, valued, and, non, classical, logics, have, been, popular, since, the, polish, logician, jan, lukasiewicz, graham, priest, is, a, dialetheist, seeing, it, as, the, most, natural, solution, to, problems, such, as, the, liar, paradox, jc, beall, together, with, greg, restall, is, a, pioneer, of, a, widely, discussed, version, of, logical, pluralism, owing, largely, to, edmund, gettier, s, 1963, paper, is, justified, true, belief, knowledge, and, the, so, called, gettier, problem, epistemology, has, enjoyed, a, resurgence, as, a, topic, of, analytic, philosophy, during, the, last, 50, years, a, large, portion, of, current, epistemological, research, is, intended, to, resolve, the, problems, that, gettier, s, examples, presented, to, the, traditional, justified, true, belief, model, of, knowledge, found, as, early, as, plato, s, dialogue, theaetetus, these, include, developing, theories, of, justification, to, deal, with, gettier, s, examples, or, giving, alternatives, to, the, justified, true, belief, model, chisholm, defended, foundationalism, quine, defended, coherentism, a, web, of, belief, quine, proposed, naturalized, epistemology, the, debate, between, internalism, and, externalism, still, exists, in, analytic, philosophy, alvin, goldman, is, an, externalist, known, for, developing, a, popular, form, of, externalism, called, reliabilism, most, externalists, reject, the, kk, thesis, which, has, been, disputed, since, the, introduction, of, the, epistemic, logic, by, jaakko, hintikka, in, 1962, while, a, problem, since, antiquity, american, philosopher, roderick, chisholm, in, his, theory, of, knowledge, details, the, problem, of, the, criterion, with, two, sets, of, questions, an, answer, to, either, set, of,

called, methodism, a, third, solution, is, skepticism, or, doubting, there, is, such, a, thing, as, knowledge, frege, questioned, standard, theories, of, truth, and, sometimes, advocated, a, redundancy, theory, of, truth, frank, ramsey, also, advocated, a, redundancy, theory, alfred, tarski, put, forward, a, semantic, theory, of, truth, in, truth, makers, 1984, kevin, mulligan, peter, simons, and, barry, smith, introduced, the, truth, maker, idea, as, a, contribution, to, the, correspondence, theory, of, truth, a, truth, maker, is, contrasted, with, a, truth, bearer, epistemic, closure, is, the, claim, that, knowledge, is, closed, under, entailment, in, other, words, epistemic, closure, is, a, property, or, the, principle, that, if, a, subject, s, displaystyle, s, knows, p,

epistemological, theories, involve, a, closure, principle, and, many, skeptical, arguments, assume, a, closure, principle, in, proof, of, an, external, world, g, e, moore, uses, closure, in, his, famous, anti, skeptical, here, is, one, hand, argument, shortly, before, his, death, wittgenstein, wrote, on, certainty, in, response, to, moore, while, the, principle, of, epistemic, closure, is, generally, regarded, as, intuitive, philosophers, such, as, fred, dretske, with, relevant, alternatives, theory, and, robert, nozick, in, philosophical, explanations, have, argued, against, it, in, his, book, fact, fiction, and, forecast, nelson, goodman, introduced, the, new, riddle, of, induction, so, called, by, analogy, with, hume, s, classical, problem, of, induction, goodman, s, famous, example, was, to, introduce, the, predicates, grue, and, bleen, grue, applies, to, all, things, before, a, certain, time, t, just, in, case, they, are, green, but, also, just, in, case, they, are, blue, after, time, t, and, bleen, applies, to, all, things, before, a, certain, time, t, just, in, the, case, they, are, blue, but, also, just, in, case, they, are, green, after, time, t, other, related, topics, of, contemporary, research, include, debates, over, basic, knowledge, the, nature, of, evidence, the, value, of, knowledge, epistemic, luck, virtue, epistemology, the, role, of, intuitions, in, justification, and, treating, knowledge, as, a, primitive, concept, due, to, the, commitments, to, empiricism, and, symbolic, logic, in, the, early, analytic, period, early, analytic, philosophers, often, thought, that, inquiry, in, the, ethical, domain, could, not, be, made, rigorous, enough, to, merit, any, attention, it, was, only, with, the, emergence, of, ordinary, language, philosophers, that, ethics, started, to, become, an, acceptable, area, of, inquiry, for, analytic, philosophers, philosophers, working, within, the, analytic, tradition, have, gradually, come, to, distinguish, three, major, types, of, moral, philosophy, as, well, as, hume, s, famous, is, ought, distinction, twentieth, century, meta, ethics, has, two, original, strains, the, first, is, g, e, moore, s, investigation, into, the, nature, of, ethical, terms, e, g, good, in, his, principia, ethica, 1903, which, advances, a, kind, of, moral, realism, called, ethical, non, naturalism, and, is, known, for, the, open, question, argument, and, identifying, the, naturalistic, fallacy, a, major, topic, of, investigation, for, analytical, philosophers, according, to, moore, goodness, is, a, simple, undefinable, non, natural, property, contemporary, philosophers, such, as, russ, shafer, landau, in, moral, realism, a, defence, defend, ethical, non, naturalism, the, second, is, founded, on, logical, positivism, and, its, attitude, that, unverifiable, statements, are, meaningless, as, a, result, they, avoided, normative, ethics, and, instead, began, meta, ethical, investigations, into, the, nature, of, moral, terms, statements, and, judgments, the, logical, positivists, opined, that, statements, about, value, including, all, ethical, and, aesthetic, judgments, are, non, cognitive, that, is, they, cannot, be, objectively, verified, or, falsified, instead, the, logical, positivists, adopted, an, emotivist, theory, which, was, that, value, judgments, expressed, the, attitude, of, the, speaker, it, is, also, known, as, the, boo, hurrah, theory, for, example, in, this, view, saying, murder, is, wrong, is, equivalent, to, saying, boo, to, murder, or, saying, the, word, murder, with, a, particular, tone, of, disapproval, while, analytic, philosophers, generally, accepted, non, cognitivism, emotivism, had, many, deficiencies, it, evolved, into, more, sophisticated, non, cognitivist, theories, such, as, the, expressivism, of, charles, stevenson, and, the, universal, prescriptivism, of, r, m, hare, which, was, based, on, j, l, austin, s, philosophy, of, speech, acts, as, non, cognitivism, the, is, ought, distinction, and, the, naturalistic, fallacy, were, questioned, analytic, philosophers, showed, a, renewed, interest, in, the, traditional, questions, of, moral, philosophy, philippa, foot, defended, naturalist, moral, realism, and, contributed, several, essays, attacking, other, theories, foot, introduced, the, famous, trolley, problem, into, the, ethical, discourse, perhaps, the, most, influential, critic, was, elizabeth, anscombe, whose, monograph, intention, was, called, by, donald, davidson, the, most, important, treatment, of, action, since, aristotle, a, favorite, student, and, friend, of, ludwig, wittgenstein, her, 1958, article, modern, moral, philosophy, declared, the, is, ought, impasse, to, be, unproductive, j, o, urmson, s, article, on, grading, also, called, the, is, ought, distinction, into, question, australian, j, l, mackie, in, ethics, inventing, right, and, wrong, defended, anti, realist, error, theory, bernard, williams, also, influenced, ethics, by, advocating, a, kind, of, moral, relativism, and, rejecting, all, other, theories, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, was, marked, by, skepticism, toward, and, neglect, of, normative, ethics, however, contemporary, normative, ethics, is, dominated, by, three, schools, consequentialism, virtue, ethics, and, deontology, during, the, early, 20th, century, utilitarianism, was, the, only, non, skeptical, type, of, ethics, to, remain, popular, among, analytic, philosophers, however, as, the, influence, of, logical, positivism, declined, mid, century, analytic, philosophers, had, a, renewed, interest, in, ethics, utilitarianism, for, and, against, was, written, with, j, j, c, smart, arguing, for, and, bernard, williams, arguing, against, anscombe, foot, and, alasdair, macintyre, s, after, virtue, sparked, a, revival, of, aristotle, s, virtue, ethical, approach, this, increased, interest, in, virtue, ethics, has, been, dubbed, the, aretaic, turn, mimicking, the, linguistic, turn, john, rawls, s, 1971, a, theory, of, justice, restored, interest, in, kantian, ethical, philosophy, since, around, 1970, a, significant, feature, of, analytic, philosophy, has, been, the, emergence, of, applied, ethics, an, interest, in, the, application, of, moral, principles, to, specific, practical, issues, the, philosophers, following, this, orientation, view, ethics, as, involving, humanistic, values, which, involve, practical, implications, and, applications, in, the, way, people, interact, and, lead, their, lives, socially, topics, of, special, interest, for, applied, ethics, include, environmental, ethics, animal, rights, and, the, many, challenges, created, by, advancing, medical, science, in, education, applied, ethics, addressed, themes, such, as, punishment, in, schools, equality, of, educational, opportunity, and, education, for, democracy, isaiah, berlin, had, a, lasting, influence, on, both, analytic, political, philosophy, and, liberalism, with, his, lecture, two, concepts, of, liberty, berlin, defined, negative, liberty, as, absence, of, coercion, or, interference, in, private, actions, positive, liberty, berlin, maintained, could, be, thought, of, as, self, mastery, which, asks, not, what, we, are, free, from, but, what, we, are, free, to, do, current, analytic, political, philosophy, owes, much, to, john, rawls, who, in, a, series, of, papers, from, the, 1950s, onward, most, notably, two, concepts, of, rules, and, justice, as, fairness, and, his, 1971, book, a, theory, of, justice, produced, a, sophisticated, defense, of, a, generally, liberal, egalitarian, account, of, distributive, justice, rawls, introduced, the, term, the, veil, of, ignorance, this, was, followed, soon, by, rawls, s, colleague, robert, nozick, s, book, anarchy, state, and, utopia, a, defense, of, free, market, libertarianism, consequentialist, libertarianism, also, derives, from, the, analytic, tradition, during, recent, decades, there, have, also, been, several, critics, of, liberalism, including, the, feminist, critiques, by, catharine, mackinnon, and, andrea, dworkin, the, multiculturalist, critiques, by, amy, gutmann, and, charles, taylor, and, the, communitarian, critiques, by, michael, sandel, and, alasdair, macintyre, although, neither, of, them, endorses, the, term, another, development, of, political, philosophy, was, the, emergence, of, the, school, of, analytical, marxism, members, of, this, school, seek, to, apply, techniques, of, analytic, philosophy, and, modern, social, science, to, clarify, the, theories, of, karl, marx, and, his, successors, the, best, known, member, of, this, school, is, g, a, cohen, whose, 1978, book, karl, marx, s, theory, of, history, a, defence, is, generally, considered, to, represent, the, genesis, of, this, school, in, that, book, cohen, used, logical, and, linguistic, analysis, to, clarify, and, defend, marx, s, materialist, conception, of, history, other, prominent, analytical, marxists, include, the, economist, john, roemer, the, social, scientist, jon, elster, and, the, sociologist, erik, olin, wright, the, work, of, these, later, philosophers, has, furthered, cohen, s, work, by, bringing, to, bear, modern, social, science, methods, such, as, rational, choice, theory, to, supplement, cohen, s, use, of, analytic, philosophical, techniques, in, the, interpretation, of, marxian, theory, cohen, himself, would, later, engage, directly, with, rawlsian, political, philosophy, to, advance, a, socialist, theory, of, justice, that, contrasts, with, both, traditional, marxism, and, the, theories, advanced, by, rawls, and, nozick, in, particular, he, indicates, marx, s, principle, of, from, each, according, to, his, ability, to, each, according, to, his, need, although, not, an, analytic, philosopher, j, rgen, habermas, is, another, influential, if, controversial, author, in, contemporary, analytic, political, philosophy, whose, social, theory, is, a, blend, of, social, science, marxism, neo, kantianism, and, american, pragmatism, communitarians, such, as, alasdair, macintyre, charles, taylor, michael, walzer, and, michael, sandel, advance, a, critique, of, liberalism, that, uses, analytic, techniques, to, isolate, the, main, assumptions, of, liberal, individualists, such, as, rawls, and, then, challenges, these, assumptions, in, particular, communitarians, challenge, the, liberal, assumption, that, the, individual, can, be, considered, as, fully, autonomous, from, the, community, in, which, he, is, brought, up, and, lives, instead, they, argue, for, a, conception, of, the, individual, that, emphasizes, the, role, that, the, community, plays, in, forming, his, or, her, values, thought, processes, and, opinions, while, in, the, analytic, tradition, its, major, exponents, often, also, engage, at, length, with, figures, generally, considered, continental, notably, g, w, f, hegel, and, friedrich, nietzsche, as, a, result, of, logical, positivism, as, well, as, what, seemed, like, rejections, of, the, traditional, aesthetic, notions, of, beauty, and, sublimity, from, post, modern, thinkers, analytic, philosophers, were, slow, to, consider, art, and, aesthetic, judgment, susanne, langer, and, nelson, goodman, addressed, these, problems, in, an, analytic, style, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, since, goodman, aesthetics, as, a, discipline, for, analytic, philosophers, has, flourished, arthur, danto, argued, for, a, institutional, definition, of, art, in, the, 1964, essay, the, artworld, in, which, danto, coined, the, term, artworld, as, opposed, to, the, existing, art, world, though, they, mean, the, same, by, which, he, meant, cultural, context, or, an, atmosphere, of, art, theory, rigorous, efforts, to, pursue, analyses, of, traditional, aesthetic, concepts, were, performed, by, guy, sircello, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, resulting, in, new, analytic, theories, of, love, sublimity, and, beauty, in, the, opinion, of, w, adys, aw, tatarkiewicz, there, are, six, conditions, for, the, presentation, of, art, beauty, form, representation, reproduction, of, reality, artistic, expression, and, innovation, however, one, may, not, be, able, to, pin, down, these, qualities, in, a, work, of, art, george, dickie, was, an, influential, philosopher, of, art, dickie, s, student, no, l, carroll, is, a, leading, philosopher, of, art, given, the, linguistic, turn, it, can, be, hard, to, separate, logic, metaphysics, and, the, philosophy, of, language, in, analytic, philosophy, philosophy, of, language, is, a, topic, that, has, decreased, in, activity, during, the, last, four, decades, as, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, few, major, philosophers, today, treat, it, as, a, primary, research, topic, while, the, debate, remains, fierce, it, is, still, strongly, influenced, by, those, authors, from, the, first, half, of, the, century, e, g, frege, russell, wittgenstein, austin, tarski, and, quine, saul, kripke, provided, a, semantics, for, modal, logic, in, his, book, naming, and, necessity, 1980, kripke, challenges, the, descriptivist, theory, with, a, causal, theory, of, reference, in, it, he, introduced, the, term, rigid, designator, according, to, one, author, in, the, philosophy, of, language, naming, and, necessity, is, among, the, most, important, works, ever, ruth, barcan, marcus, also, challenged, descriptivism, so, did, keith, donnellan, hilary, putnam, used, the, twin, earth, thought, experiment, to, argue, for, semantic, externalism, or, the, view, that, the, meanings, of, words, are, not, psychological, donald, davidson, uses, the, thought, experiment, of, swampman, to, advocate, for, semantic, externalism, kripke, in, wittgenstein, on, rules, and, private, language, provides, a, rule, following, paradox, that, undermines, the, possibility, of, our, ever, following, rules, in, our, use, of, language, and, so, calls, into, question, the, idea, of, meaning, kripke, writes, that, this, paradox, is, the, most, radical, and, original, skeptical, problem, that, philosophy, has, seen, to, date, the, portmanteau,

motivated, by, the, logical, positivists, interest, in, verificationism, logical, behaviorism, was, the, most, prominent, theory, of, mind, of, analytic, philosophy, for, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, behaviorism, later, became, much, less, popular, in, favor, of, either, type, physicalism, or, functionalism, during, this, period, topics, of, the, philosophy, of, mind, were, often, related, strongly, to, topics, of, cognitive, science, such, as, modularity, or, innateness, behaviorists, such, as, b, f, skinner, tended, to, opine, either, that, statements, about, the, mind, were, equivalent, to, statements, about, behavior, and, dispositions, to, behave, in, particular, ways, or, that, mental, states, were, directly, equivalent, to, behavior, and, dispositions, to, behave, hilary, putnam, criticized, behaviorism, by, arguing, that, it, confuses, the, symptoms, of, mental, states, with, the, mental, states, themselves, positing, super, spartans, who, never, display,

hostile, forms, of, analytic, philosophy, 3, as, with, the, study, of, ethics, early, analytic, philosophy, tended, to, avoid, the, study, of, religion, largely, dismissing, as, per, the, logical, positivists, the, subject, as, a, part, of, metaphysics, and, therefore, meaningless, the, demise, of, logical, positivism, led, to, a, renewed, interest, in, the, philosophy, of, religion, prompting, philosophers, not, only, to, introduce, new, problems, but, to, re, study, classical, topics, such, as, the, existence, of, god, the, nature, of, miracles, the, problem, of, evil, the, rationality,
