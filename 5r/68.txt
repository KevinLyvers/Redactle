metaphysics, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, that, examines, the, basic, structure, of, reality, it, is, often, characterized, as, first, philosophy, implying, that, it, is, more, fundamental, than, other, forms, of, philosophical, inquiry, metaphysics, is, traditionally, seen, as, the, study, of, mind, independent, features, of, the, world, but, some, modern, theorists, understand, it, as, an, inquiry, into, the, conceptual, schemes, that, underlie, human, thought, and, experience, many, general, and, abstract, topics, belong, to, the, subject, of, metaphysics, it, investigates, the, nature, of, existence, the, features, all, entities, have, in, common, and, their, division, into, categories, of, being, an, influential, contrast, is, between, particulars, which, are, individual, unique, entities, like, a, specific, apple, and, universals, which, are, general, repeatable, entities, that, characterize, particulars, like, the, color, red, modal, metaphysics, examines, what, it, means, for, something, to, be, possible, or, necessary, the, nature, of, space, time, and, change, is, also, discussed, by, metaphysicians, a, closely, related, issue, concerns, the, essence, of, causality, and, its, relation, to, the, laws, of, nature, other, topics, include, how, mind, and, matter, are, related, whether, everything, in, the, world, is, predetermined, and, whether, there, is, free, will, metaphysicians, employ, various, methods, to, conduct, their, inquiry, traditionally, they, rely, on, rational, intuitions, and, abstract, reasoning, but, have, more, recently, also, included, empirical, approaches, associated, with, scientific, theories, due, to, the, abstract, nature, of, its, topic, metaphysics, has, received, criticisms, questioning, the, reliability, of, its, methods, and, the, meaningfulness, of, its, theories, metaphysics, is, relevant, to, many, fields, of, inquiry, that, often, implicitly, rely, on, metaphysical, concepts, and, assumptions, the, origin, of, metaphysics, lies, in, antiquity, with, speculations, about, the, nature, of, reality, and, the, universe, like, those, found, in, the, upanishads, in, ancient, india, daoism, in, ancient, china, and, pre, socratic, philosophy, in, ancient, greece, the, subsequent, medieval, period, in, the, west, discussed, the, nature, of, universals, as, shaped, by, ancient, greek, philosophers, plato, and, aristotle, the, modern, period, saw, the, emergence, of, various, comprehensive, systems, of, metaphysics, many, of, which, embraced, idealism, in, the, 20th, century, and, contemporary, period, a, revolt, against, idealism, was, started, and, metaphysics, was, once, declared, meaningless, then, revived, with, various, criticisms, of, earlier, theories, and, new, approaches, to, metaphysical, inquiry, metaphysics, is, the, study, of, the, most, general, features, of, reality, including, existence, objects, and, their, properties, possibility, and, necessity, space, and, time, change, causation, and, the, relation, between, matter, and, mind, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, branches, of, philosophy, the, precise, nature, of, metaphysics, is, disputed, and, its, characterization, has, changed, in, the, course, of, history, some, approaches, see, metaphysics, as, a, unified, field, and, give, a, wide, sweeping, definition, by, understanding, it, as, the, study, of, fundamental, questions, about, the, nature, of, reality, or, as, an, inquiry, into, the, essences, of, things, another, approach, doubts, that, the, different, areas, of, metaphysics, share, a, set, of, underlying, features, and, provides, instead, a, fine, grained, characterization, by, listing, all, the, main, topics, investigated, by, metaphysicians, some, definitions, are, descriptive, by, providing, an, account, of, what, metaphysicians, do, while, others, are, normative, and, prescribe, what, metaphysicians, ought, to, do, two, historically, influential, definitions, in, ancient, and, medieval, philosophy, understand, metaphysics, as, the, science, of, the, first, causes, and, as, the, study, of, being, qua, being, that, is, the, topic, of, what, all, beings, have, in, common, and, to, what, fundamental, categories, they, belong, in, the, modern, period, the, scope, of, metaphysics, was, extended, to, cover, topics, such, as, the, distinction, between, mind, and, body, and, free, will, some, philosophers, follow, aristotle, in, describing, metaphysics, as, first, philosophy, implying, that, it, is, the, most, basic, inquiry, while, all, other, branches, of, philosophy, depend, on, it, in, some, way, metaphysics, is, traditionally, understood, as, a, study, of, mind, independent, features, of, reality, starting, with, immanuel, kant, s, critical, philosophy, an, alternative, conception, gained, prominence, that, focuses, on, conceptual, schemes, rather, than, external, reality, kant, distinguishes, transcendent, metaphysics, which, aims, to, describe, the, objective, features, of, reality, beyond, sense, experience, from, critical, metaphysics, which, outlines, the, aspects, and, principles, underlying, all, human, thought, and, experience, regarding, the, analysis, of, conceptual, schemes, philosopher, p, f, strawson, contrasts, descriptive, metaphysics, which, articulates, conceptual, schemes, commonly, used, to, understand, the, world, with, revisionary, metaphysics, which, aims, to, produce, better, conceptual, schemes, metaphysics, differs, from, the, individual, sciences, by, studying, very, general, and, abstract, aspects, of, reality, the, individual, sciences, by, contrast, examine, more, specific, and, concrete, features, and, restrict, themselves, to, certain, classes, of, entities, such, as, the, focus, on, physical, things, in, physics, living, entities, in, biology, and, cultures, in, anthropology, it, is, disputed, to, what, extent, this, contrast, is, a, strict, dichotomy, rather, than, a, gradual, continuum, philosophers, engaged, in, metaphysics, are, called, metaphysicians, or, metaphysicists, outside, the, academic, discourse, the, term, metaphysics, is, sometimes, used, in, a, different, sense, for, the, study, of, occult, and, paranormal, phenomena, like, metaphysical, healing, auras, and, the, power, of, pyramids, the, word, metaphysics, has, its, origin, in, the, ancient, greek, words, met, meaning, after, above, and, beyond, and, phusik, as, a, short, form, of, ta, met, ta, phusik, that, is, what, comes, after, the, physics, this, is, frequently, interpreted, in, the, sense, that, metaphysics, discusses, topics, that, due, to, their, generality, and, comprehensiveness, lie, beyond, the, realm, of, physics, and, its, focus, on, empirical, observation, metaphysics, got, its, name, by, a, historical, accident, when, aristotle, s, book, on, this, subject, was, published, aristotle, did, not, use, the, term, metaphysics, but, his, editor, likely, andronicus, of, rhodes, may, have, coined, it, for, its, title, to, indicate, that, this, book, should, be, studied, after, aristotle, s, book, published, on, physics, literally, after, physics, the, term, entered, the, english, language, through, the, latin, word, metaphysica, the, nature, of, metaphysics, can, also, be, characterized, in, relation, to, its, main, branches, an, influential, division, from, early, modern, philosophy, distinguishes, between, general, and, special, or, specific, metaphysics, general, metaphysics, also, called, ontology, takes, the, widest, perspective, and, studies, the, most, fundamental, aspects, of, being, it, investigates, the, features, that, all, entities, have, in, common, and, how, entities, can, be, divided, into, different, categories, categories, are, the, most, general, kinds, such, as, substance, property, relation, and, fact, ontologists, research, which, categories, there, are, how, they, depend, on, one, another, and, how, they, form, a, system, of, categories, that, provides, an, encompassing, classification, of, all, entities, special, metaphysics, considers, being, from, more, narrow, perspectives, and, is, divided, into, subdisciplines, based, on, the, perspective, they, take, metaphysical, cosmology, examines, changeable, things, and, investigates, how, they, are, connected, to, form, a, world, as, a, totality, of, entities, extending, through, space, and, time, rational, psychology, restricts, itself, to, exploring, metaphysical, foundations, and, problems, concerning, the, mind, such, as, its, relation, to, matter, and, the, freedom, of, the, will, natural, theology, studies, the, divine, and, its, role, as, the, first, cause, the, scope, of, special, metaphysics, overlaps, with, other, philosophical, disciplines, and, it, is, often, not, clear, whether, a, topic, belongs, to, it, rather, than, to, disciplines, like, philosophy, of, mind, and, theology, applied, metaphysics, is, a, young, subdiscipline, it, belongs, to, applied, philosophy, and, studies, the, applications, of, metaphysics, both, within, philosophy, and, other, fields, of, inquiry, in, ethics, and, philosophy, of, religion, it, concerns, topics, like, the, ontological, foundation, of, moral, claims, and, religious, doctrines, applications, outside, philosophy, include, the, use, of, ontologies, in, artificial, intelligence, economics, and, sociology, to, classify, entities, as, well, as, questions, in, psychiatry, and, medicine, about, the, metaphysical, status, of, diseases, meta, metaphysics, is, the, metatheory, of, metaphysics, and, investigates, the, nature, and, methods, of, metaphysics, it, also, examines, how, metaphysics, differs, from, other, philosophical, and, scientific, disciplines, and, how, it, is, relevant, to, them, while, the, discussions, of, its, topics, have, a, long, history, in, metaphysics, it, has, only, recently, developed, into, a, systematic, field, of, inquiry, metaphysicians, often, see, existence, or, being, as, one, of, the, most, basic, and, general, concepts, to, exist, means, to, form, part, of, reality, and, existence, marks, the, difference, between, real, entities, and, imaginary, ones, according, to, the, orthodox, view, existence, is, a, second, order, property, or, a, property, of, properties, if, an, entity, exists, then, its, properties, are, instantiated, a, different, position, states, that, existence, is, a, first, order, property, meaning, that, it, is, similar, to, other, properties, of, entities, such, as, shape, or, size, it, is, controversial, whether, all, entities, have, this, property, according, to, alexius, meinong, there, are, nonexistent, objects, including, merely, possible, objects, like, santa, claus, and, pegasus, a, related, question, is, whether, existence, is, the, same, for, all, entities, or, whether, there, are, different, modes, or, degrees, of, existence, for, instance, plato, held, that, platonic, forms, which, are, perfect, and, immutable, ideas, have, a, higher, degree, of, existence, than, matter, which, is, only, able, to, imperfectly, mirror, platonic, forms, another, key, concern, in, metaphysics, is, the, division, of, entities, into, different, groups, based, on, underlying, features, they, have, in, common, theories, of, categories, provide, a, system, of, the, most, fundamental, kinds, or, the, highest, genera, of, being, by, establishing, a, comprehensive, inventory, of, everything, one, of, the, earliest, theories, of, categories, was, provided, by, aristotle, who, proposed, a, system, of, 10, categories, substances, e, g, man, and, horse, are, the, most, important, category, since, all, other, categories, like, quantity, e, g, four, quality, e, g, white, and, place, e, g, in, athens, are, said, of, substances, and, depend, on, them, kant, understood, categories, as, fundamental, principles, underlying, human, understanding, and, developed, a, system, of, 12, categories, which, are, divided, into, the, four, classes, quantity, quality, relation, and, modality, more, recent, theories, of, categories, were, proposed, by, c, s, peirce, edmund, husserl, samuel, alexander, roderick, chisholm, and, e, j, lowe, many, philosophers, rely, on, the, contrast, between, concrete, and, abstract, objects, according, to, a, common, view, concrete, objects, like, rocks, trees, and, human, beings, exist, in, space, and, time, undergo, changes, and, impact, each, other, as, cause, and, effect, while, abstract, objects, like, numbers, and, sets, exist, outside, space, and, time, are, immutable, and, do, not, enter, into, causal, relations, particulars, are, individual, entities, and, include, both, concrete, objects, like, aristotle, the, eiffel, tower, or, a, specific, apple, and, abstract, objects, like, the, number, 2, or, a, specific, set, in, mathematics, also, called, individuals, they, are, unique, non, repeatable, entities, and, contrast, with, universals, like, the, color, red, which, can, at, the, same, time, exist, in, several, places, and, characterize, several, particulars, a, widely, held, view, is, that, particulars, instantiate, universals, but, are, not, themselves, instantiated, by, something, else, meaning, that, they, exist, in, themselves, while, universals, exist, in, something, else, substratum, theory, analyzes, particulars, as, a, substratum, also, called, bare, particular, together, with, various, properties, the, substratum, confers, individuality, to, the, particular, while, the, properties, express, its, qualitative, features, or, what, it, is, like, this, approach, is, rejected, by, bundle, theorists, who, state, that, particulars, are, only, bundles, of, properties, without, an, underlying, substratum, some, bundle, theorists, include, in, the, bundle, an, individual, essence, called, haecceity, to, ensure, that, each, bundle, is, unique, another, proposal, for, concrete, particulars, is, that, they, are, individuated, by, their, space, time, location, concrete, particulars, encountered, in, everyday, life, like, rocks, tables, and, organisms, are, complex, entities, composed, of, various, parts, for, example, a, table, is, made, up, of, a, tabletop, and, legs, each, of, which, is, itself, made, up, of, countless, particles, the, relation, between, parts, and, wholes, is, studied, by, mereology, the, problem, of, the, many, is, about, which, groups, of, entities, form, mereological, wholes, for, instance, whether, a, dust, particle, on, the, tabletop, forms, part, of, the, table, according, to, mereological, universalists, every, collection, of, entities, forms, a, whole, meaning, that, the, parts, of, the, table, without, the, dust, particle, form, one, whole, while, they, together, with, it, form, a, second, whole, mereological, moderatists, hold, that, certain, conditions, have, to, be, fulfilled, for, a, group, of, entities, to, compose, a, whole, for, example, that, the, entities, touch, one, another, mereological, nihilists, reject, the, idea, that, there, are, any, wholes, according, to, them, there, are, no, tables, and, chairs, but, only, particles, that, are, arranged, table, wise, and, chair, wise, a, related, mereological, problem, is, whether, there, are, simple, entities, that, have, no, parts, as, atomists, claim, or, not, as, continuum, theorists, contend, universals, are, general, entities, encompassing, both, properties, and, relations, that, express, what, particulars, are, like, and, how, they, resemble, one, another, they, are, repeatable, meaning, that, they, are, not, limited, to, a, unique, existent, but, can, be, instantiated, by, different, particulars, at, the, same, time, for, example, the, particulars, nelson, mandela, and, mahatma, gandhi, instantiate, the, universal, humanity, similar, to, how, a, strawberry, and, a, ruby, instantiate, the, universal, red, a, topic, discussed, since, ancient, philosophy, the, problem, of, universals, consists, in, the, challenge, of, characterizing, the, ontological, status, of, universals, realists, argue, that, universals, are, real, mind, independent, entities, that, exist, in, addition, to, particulars, according, to, platonic, realists, universals, exist, also, independently, of, particulars, which, implies, that, the, universal, red, would, continue, to, exist, even, if, there, were, no, red, things, a, more, moderate, form, of, realism, inspired, by, aristotle, states, that, universals, depend, on, particulars, meaning, that, they, are, only, real, if, they, are, instantiated, nominalists, reject, the, idea, that, universals, exist, in, either, form, for, them, the, world, is, composed, exclusively, of, particulars, the, position, of, conceptualists, constitutes, a, middle, ground, they, state, that, universals, exist, but, only, as, concepts, in, the, mind, used, to, order, experience, by, classifying, entities, natural, and, social, kinds, are, often, understood, as, special, types, of, universals, entities, belonging, to, the, same, natural, kind, share, certain, fundamental, features, characteristic, of, the, structure, of, the, natural, world, in, this, regard, natural, kinds, are, not, an, artificially, made, up, classification, but, are, discovered, usually, by, the, natural, sciences, and, include, kinds, like, electrons, h, 2, o, and, tigers, scientific, realists, and, anti, realists, are, in, disagreement, about, whether, natural, kinds, exist, social, kinds, are, studied, by, social, metaphysics, and, characterized, as, useful, social, constructions, that, while, not, purely, fictional, fail, to, reflect, the, fundamental, structure, of, mind, independent, reality, uncontroversial, examples, include, money, or, baseball, the, concepts, of, possibility, and, necessity, convey, what, can, or, must, be, the, case, expressed, in, statements, like, it, is, possible, to, find, a, cure, for, cancer, and, it, is, necessary, that, two, plus, two, equals, four, they, belong, to, modal, metaphysics, which, investigates, the, metaphysical, principles, underlying, them, in, particular, why, it, is, the, case, that, some, modal, statements, are, true, while, others, are, false, some, metaphysicians, hold, that, modality, is, a, fundamental, aspect, of, reality, meaning, that, besides, facts, about, what, is, the, case, there, are, additional, facts, about, what, could, or, must, be, the, case, a, different, view, argues, that, modal, truths, are, not, about, an, independent, aspect, of, reality, but, can, be, reduced, to, non, modal, characteristics, for, example, to, facts, about, what, properties, or, linguistic, descriptions, are, compatible, with, each, other, or, to, fictional, statements, borrowing, a, term, from, german, philosopher, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, s, theodicy, many, metaphysicians, use, the, concept, of, possible, worlds, to, analyze, the, meaning, and, ontological, ramifications, of, modal, statements, a, possible, world, is, a, complete, and, consistent, way, of, how, things, could, have, been, for, example, the, dinosaurs, were, wiped, out, in, the, actual, world, but, there, are, possible, worlds, in, which, they, are, still, alive, according, to, possible, world, semantics, a, statement, is, possibly, true, if, it, is, true, in, at, least, one, possible, world, while, it, is, necessarily, true, if, it, is, true, in, all, possible, worlds, modal, realists, argue, that, possible, worlds, exist, as, concrete, entities, in, the, same, sense, as, the, actual, world, with, the, main, difference, being, that, the, actual, world, is, the, world, we, live, in, while, other, possible, worlds, are, inhabited, by, counterparts, this, view, is, controversial, and, various, alternatives, have, been, suggested, for, example, that, possible, worlds, only, exist, as, abstract, objects, or, that, they, are, similar, to, stories, told, in, works, of, fiction, space, and, time, are, dimensions, that, entities, occupy, spacetime, realists, state, that, space, and, time, are, fundamental, aspects, of, reality, and, exist, independently, of, the, human, mind, this, view, is, rejected, by, spacetime, idealists, who, hold, that, space, and, time, are, constructions, of, the, human, mind, in, its, attempt, to, organize, and, make, sense, of, reality, spacetime, absolutism, or, substantivalism, understands, spacetime, as, a, distinct, object, with, some, metaphysicians, conceptualizing, it, as, a, box, that, contains, all, other, entities, within, it, spacetime, relationism, by, contrast, sees, spacetime, not, as, an, object, but, as, relations, between, objects, such, as, the, spatial, relation, of, being, next, to, and, the, temporal, relation, of, coming, before, in, the, metaphysics, of, time, an, important, contrast, is, between, the, a, series, and, the, b, series, according, to, the, a, series, theory, the, flow, of, time, is, real, meaning, that, events, are, categorized, into, the, past, present, and, future, the, present, keeps, moving, forward, in, time, and, events, that, are, in, the, present, now, will, change, their, status, and, lie, in, the, past, later, from, the, perspective, of, the, b, series, theory, time, is, static, and, events, are, ordered, by, the, temporal, relations, earlier, than, and, later, than, without, any, essential, difference, between, past, present, and, future, eternalism, holds, that, past, present, and, future, are, equally, real, while, according, to, presentists, only, entities, in, the, present, exist, material, objects, persist, through, time, and, change, in, the, process, like, a, tree, that, grows, or, loses, leaves, the, main, ways, of, conceptualizing, persistence, through, time, are, endurantism, and, perdurantism, according, to, endurantism, material, objects, are, three, dimensional, entities, that, are, wholly, present, at, each, moment, as, they, change, they, gain, or, lose, properties, but, remain, the, same, otherwise, perdurantists, see, material, objects, as, four, dimensional, entities, that, extend, through, time, and, are, made, up, of, different, temporal, parts, at, each, moment, only, one, part, of, the, object, is, present, but, not, the, object, as, a, whole, change, means, that, an, earlier, part, is, qualitatively, different, from, a, later, part, for, example, if, a, banana, ripens, then, there, is, an, unripe, part, followed, by, a, ripe, part, causality, is, the, relation, between, cause, and, effect, whereby, one, entity, produces, or, affects, another, entity, for, instance, if, a, person, bumps, a, glass, and, spills, its, contents, then, the, bump, is, the, cause, and, the, spill, is, the, effect, besides, the, single, case, causation, between, particulars, in, this, example, there, is, also, general, case, causation, expressed, in, general, statements, such, as, smoking, causes, cancer, the, term, agent, causation, is, used, if, people, and, their, actions, cause, something, causation, is, usually, interpreted, deterministically, meaning, that, a, cause, always, brings, about, its, effect, this, view, is, rejected, by, probabilistic, theories, which, claim, that, the, cause, merely, increases, the, probability, that, the, effect, occurs, this, view, can, be, used, to, explain, that, smoking, causes, cancer, even, though, this, is, not, true, in, every, single, case, the, regularity, theory, of, causation, inspired, by, david, hume, s, philosophy, states, that, causation, is, nothing, but, a, constant, conjunction, in, which, the, mind, apprehends, that, one, phenomenon, like, putting, one, s, hand, in, a, fire, is, always, followed, by, another, phenomenon, like, a, feeling, of, pain, according, to, nomic, regularity, theories, the, regularities, take, the, forms, of, laws, of, nature, studied, by, science, counterfactual, theories, focus, not, on, regularities, but, on, how, effects, depend, on, their, causes, they, state, that, effects, owe, their, existence, to, the, cause, and, would, not, be, present, without, them, according, to, primitivism, causation, is, a, basic, concept, that, cannot, be, analyzed, in, terms, of, non, causal, concepts, such, as, regularities, or, dependence, relations, one, form, of, primitivism, identifies, causal, powers, inherent, in, entities, as, the, underlying, mechanism, eliminativists, reject, the, above, theories, by, holding, that, there, is, no, causation, mind, encompasses, phenomena, like, thinking, perceiving, feeling, and, desiring, as, well, as, the, underlying, faculties, responsible, for, these, phenomena, the, mind, body, problem, is, the, challenge, of, clarifying, the, relation, between, physical, and, mental, phenomena, according, to, cartesian, dualism, minds, and, bodies, are, distinct, substances, they, causally, interact, with, each, other, in, various, ways, but, can, at, least, in, principle, exist, on, their, own, this, view, is, rejected, by, monists, who, argue, that, reality, is, made, up, of, only, one, kind, according, to, idealism, everything, is, mental, including, physical, objects, which, may, be, understood, as, ideas, or, perceptions, of, conscious, minds, materialists, by, contrast, state, that, all, reality, is, at, its, core, material, some, deny, that, mind, exists, but, the, more, common, approach, is, to, explain, mind, in, terms, of, certain, aspects, of, matter, such, as, brain, states, behavioral, dispositions, or, functional, roles, neutral, monists, argue, that, reality, is, fundamentally, neither, material, nor, mental, and, suggest, that, matter, and, mind, are, both, derivative, phenomena, a, key, aspect, of, the, mind, body, problem, is, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, which, concerns, the, question, of, how, physical, systems, like, brains, can, produce, phenomenal, consciousness, the, status, of, free, will, as, the, ability, of, a, person, to, choose, their, actions, is, a, central, aspect, of, the, mind, body, problem, metaphysicians, are, interested, in, the, relation, between, free, will, and, causal, determinism, the, view, that, everything, in, the, universe, including, human, behavior, is, determined, by, preceding, events, and, laws, of, nature, it, is, controversial, whether, causal, determinism, is, true, and, if, so, whether, this, would, imply, that, there, is, no, free, will, according, to, incompatibilism, free, will, cannot, exist, in, a, deterministic, world, since, there, is, no, true, choice, or, control, if, everything, is, determined, hard, determinists, infer, from, this, observation, that, there, is, no, free, will, while, libertarians, conclude, that, determinism, must, be, false, compatibilists, take, a, third, approach, by, arguing, that, determinism, and, free, will, do, not, exclude, each, other, for, instance, because, a, person, can, still, act, in, tune, with, their, motivation, and, choices, even, if, they, are, determined, by, other, forces, free, will, plays, a, key, role, in, ethics, regarding, the, moral, responsibility, people, have, for, what, they, do, identity, is, a, relation, that, every, entity, has, to, itself, as, a, form, of, sameness, it, refers, to, numerical, identity, when, the, very, same, entity, is, involved, as, in, the, statement, the, morning, star, is, the, evening, star, both, are, the, planet, venus, in, a, slightly, different, sense, it, encompasses, qualitative, identity, also, called, exact, similarity, and, indiscernibility, which, is, the, case, when, two, distinct, entities, are, exactly, alike, such, as, perfect, identical, twins, the, principle, of, the, indiscernibility, of, identicals, is, widely, accepted, and, holds, that, numerically, identical, entities, exactly, resemble, one, another, the, converse, principle, known, as, identity, of, indiscernibles, or, leibniz, s, law, is, more, controversial, and, states, that, two, entities, are, numerically, identical, if, they, exactly, resemble, one, another, another, distinction, is, between, synchronic, and, diachronic, identity, synchronic, identity, relates, an, entity, to, itself, at, the, same, time, while, diachronic, identity, is, about, the, same, entity, at, different, times, as, in, statements, like, the, table, i, bought, last, year, is, the, same, as, the, table, in, my, dining, room, now, personal, identity, is, a, related, topic, in, metaphysics, that, uses, the, term, identity, in, a, slightly, different, sense, and, concerns, questions, like, what, personhood, is, or, what, makes, someone, a, person, various, contemporary, metaphysicians, rely, on, the, concepts, of, truth, truth, bearer, and, truthmaker, to, conduct, their, inquiry, truth, is, a, property, of, being, in, accord, with, reality, truth, bearers, are, entities, that, can, be, true, or, false, such, as, linguistic, statements, and, mental, representations, a, truthmaker, of, a, statement, is, the, entity, whose, existence, makes, the, statement, true, for, example, the, statement, a, tomato, is, red, is, true, because, there, exists, a, red, tomato, as, its, truthmaker, based, on, this, observation, it, is, possible, to, pursue, metaphysical, research, by, asking, what, the, truthmakers, of, statements, are, with, different, areas, of, metaphysics, being, dedicated, to, different, types, of, statements, according, to, this, view, modal, metaphysics, asks, what, makes, statements, about, what, is, possible, and, necessary, true, while, the, metaphysics, of, time, is, interested, in, the, truthmakers, of, temporal, statements, about, the, past, present, and, future, metaphysicians, employ, a, variety, of, methods, to, arrive, at, metaphysical, theories, and, formulate, arguments, for, and, against, them, traditionally, a, priori, methods, are, the, dominant, approach, they, rely, on, rational, intuition, and, abstract, reasoning, from, general, principles, rather, than, sensory, experience, a, posteriori, approaches, by, contrast, ground, metaphysical, theories, in, empirical, observations, and, scientific, theories, some, metaphysicians, use, perspectives, from, fields, such, as, physics, psychology, linguistics, and, history, to, conduct, their, inquiry, the, two, approaches, are, not, exclusive, and, it, is, possible, to, combine, elements, from, both, which, method, a, metaphysician, employs, often, depends, on, their, conception, of, the, nature, of, metaphysics, for, example, whether, they, see, it, as, an, inquiry, into, the, mind, independent, structure, of, reality, as, metaphysical, realists, claim, or, the, principles, underlying, thought, and, experience, as, some, metaphysical, anti, realists, contend, a, priori, approaches, often, rely, on, intuitions, that, is, non, inferential, impressions, about, the, correctness, of, specific, claims, or, general, principles, for, example, arguments, for, the, a, theory, of, time, which, states, that, time, flows, from, the, past, through, the, present, and, into, the, future, often, rely, on, pre, theoretical, intuitions, associated, with, the, sense, of, the, passage, of, time, some, approaches, use, intuitions, to, establish, a, small, set, of, self, evident, fundamental, principles, known, as, axioms, and, employ, deductive, reasoning, to, build, complex, metaphysical, systems, by, drawing, conclusions, from, these, axioms, intuition, based, approaches, can, be, combined, with, thought, experiments, which, help, evoke, and, clarify, intuitions, by, linking, them, to, imagined, situations, while, using, counterfactual, thinking, to, assess, the, possible, consequences, of, these, situations, to, explore, the, relation, between, matter, and, consciousness, some, theorists, compare, humans, to, philosophical, zombies, that, is, hypothetical, creatures, identical, to, humans, but, without, conscious, experience, a, related, method, relies, on, commonly, accepted, beliefs, instead, of, intuitions, to, formulate, arguments, and, theories, the, common, sense, approach, is, often, used, to, criticize, metaphysical, theories, that, deviate, a, lot, from, how, the, average, person, thinks, about, an, issue, for, example, common, sense, philosophers, have, argued, that, mereological, nihilism, is, false, since, it, implies, that, commonly, accepted, things, like, tables, do, not, exist, conceptual, analysis, a, method, particularly, prominent, in, analytic, philosophy, aims, to, decompose, metaphysical, concepts, into, component, parts, to, clarify, their, meaning, and, identify, essential, relations, in, phenomenology, the, method, of, eidetic, variation, is, used, to, investigate, essential, structures, underlying, phenomena, to, study, the, essential, features, of, any, kind, of, object, it, proceeds, by, imagining, this, object, and, varying, its, features, to, identify, which, ones, are, essential, and, cannot, be, changed, the, transcendental, method, is, a, further, approach, and, examines, the, metaphysical, structure, of, reality, by, observing, what, entities, there, are, and, studying, the, conditions, of, possibility, without, which, these, entities, could, not, exist, some, approaches, give, less, importance, to, a, priori, reasoning, and, see, metaphysics, instead, as, a, practice, continuous, with, the, empirical, sciences, that, generalizes, their, insights, while, making, their, underlying, assumptions, explicit, this, approach, is, known, as, naturalized, metaphysics, and, is, closely, associated, with, the, work, of, willard, van, orman, quine, he, relies, on, the, idea, that, true, sentences, from, the, sciences, and, other, fields, have, ontological, commitments, that, is, they, imply, that, certain, entities, exist, for, example, if, the, sentence, some, electrons, are, bonded, to, protons, is, true, then, it, can, be, used, to, justify, that, electrons, and, protons, exist, quine, used, this, insight, to, argue, that, one, can, learn, about, metaphysics, by, closely, analyzing, scientific, claims, to, understand, what, kind, of, metaphysical, picture, of, the, world, they, presuppose, in, addition, to, methods, of, conducting, metaphysical, inquiry, there, are, various, methodological, principles, used, to, decide, between, competing, theories, by, comparing, their, theoretical, virtues, ockham, s, razor, is, a, well, known, principle, that, gives, preference, to, simple, theories, in, particular, to, theories, that, assume, that, few, entities, exist, other, principles, consider, explanatory, power, theoretical, usefulness, and, proximity, to, established, beliefs, despite, its, status, as, one, of, the, main, branches, of, philosophy, metaphysics, has, received, numerous, criticisms, putting, into, question, its, status, as, a, legitimate, field, of, inquiry, one, type, of, criticism, states, that, metaphysical, inquiry, is, impossible, because, humans, do, not, have, the, cognitive, capacities, needed, to, access, the, ultimate, nature, of, reality, this, line, of, thought, leads, to, a, form, of, skepticism, about, the, possibility, of, metaphysical, knowledge, it, is, often, followed, by, empiricists, like, hume, who, argue, that, there, is, no, good, source, of, metaphysical, knowledge, since, metaphysics, lies, outside, the, field, of, empirical, knowledge, and, relies, on, dubious, intuitions, about, the, realm, beyond, sensory, experience, a, closely, related, concern, about, the, unreliability, of, metaphysical, theorizing, is, that, there, are, deep, and, lasting, disagreements, about, metaphysical, issues, indicating, a, lack, of, overall, progress, another, criticism, holds, that, the, problem, lies, not, with, human, cognitive, abilities, but, with, metaphysical, statements, themselves, which, are, claimed, to, be, neither, true, nor, false, but, meaningless, according, to, logical, positivists, for, instance, the, meaning, of, a, statement, is, given, by, the, procedure, used, to, verify, it, usually, in, terms, of, the, observations, that, would, confirm, it, based, on, this, controversial, assumption, they, argue, that, metaphysical, statements, are, meaningless, since, they, do, not, make, predictions, about, experience, a, slightly, weaker, position, allows, metaphysical, statements, to, have, meaning, while, holding, that, metaphysical, disagreements, are, merely, verbal, disputes, about, different, ways, to, describe, the, world, according, to, this, view, the, disagreement, in, the, metaphysics, of, composition, about, whether, there, are, tables, or, only, particles, arranged, table, wise, is, a, trivial, debate, about, linguistic, preferences, without, any, substantive, consequences, for, the, nature, of, reality, the, position, that, metaphysical, disputes, have, no, meaning, or, no, significant, point, is, called, metaphysical, or, ontological, deflationism, this, view, is, opposed, by, serious, metaphysicians, who, contend, that, metaphysical, disputes, are, about, substantial, features, of, the, underlying, structure, of, reality, a, closely, related, debate, between, ontological, realists, and, anti, realists, concerns, the, question, of, whether, there, are, any, objective, facts, that, determine, which, metaphysical, theories, are, true, a, different, criticism, formulated, by, pragmatists, sees, the, fault, of, metaphysics, not, in, its, cognitive, ambitions, or, the, meaninglessness, of, its, statements, but, in, its, practical, irrelevance, and, lack, of, usefulness, martin, heidegger, criticized, traditional, metaphysics, saying, that, it, fails, to, distinguish, between, individual, entities, and, being, as, their, ontological, ground, his, attempt, to, reveal, the, underlying, assumptions, and, limitations, in, the, history, of, metaphysics, to, overcome, metaphysics, influenced, jacques, derrida, s, method, of, deconstruction, derrida, employed, this, approach, to, criticize, metaphysical, texts, for, relying, on, opposing, terms, like, presence, and, absence, which, he, thought, were, inherently, unstable, and, contradictory, it, is, questionable, to, what, extent, the, criticisms, of, metaphysics, affect, the, discipline, as, a, whole, or, only, certain, issues, or, approaches, in, it, for, example, it, could, be, the, case, that, certain, metaphysical, disputes, are, merely, verbal, while, others, are, substantive, metaphysics, is, related, to, many, fields, of, inquiry, by, investigating, their, basic, concepts, and, relation, to, the, fundamental, structure, of, reality, for, example, scientists, often, rely, on, concepts, such, as, law, of, nature, causation, necessity, and, spacetime, to, formulate, their, theories, and, predict, or, explain, the, outcomes, of, experiments, while, the, main, focus, of, scientists, is, on, the, application, of, these, concepts, to, specific, situations, metaphysics, examines, their, general, nature, and, how, they, depend, on, each, other, physicists, formulate, specific, laws, of, nature, like, laws, of, gravitation, and, thermodynamics, to, describe, how, physical, systems, behave, under, various, conditions, metaphysicians, by, contrast, ask, what, all, laws, of, nature, have, in, common, for, example, whether, they, merely, describe, contingent, regularities, or, express, necessary, relations, at, the, same, time, new, scientific, findings, have, also, influenced, existing, and, inspired, new, metaphysical, theories, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, for, instance, prompted, various, metaphysicians, to, conceive, space, and, time, as, a, unified, dimension, rather, than, as, independent, dimensions, empirically, focused, metaphysicians, often, rely, on, scientific, theories, to, ground, their, theories, about, the, nature, of, reality, in, empirical, observations, similar, issues, pertain, to, the, social, sciences, where, metaphysicians, investigate, their, basic, concepts, and, analyze, their, metaphysical, implications, this, includes, questions, like, whether, social, facts, arise, from, non, social, facts, whether, social, groups, and, institutions, have, mind, independent, existence, and, how, they, persist, through, time, metaphysical, assumptions, and, topics, in, psychology, and, psychiatry, include, the, questions, about, the, relation, between, body, and, mind, whether, the, nature, of, the, human, mind, is, historically, fixed, and, what, the, metaphysical, status, of, diseases, is, metaphysics, is, similar, to, both, physical, cosmology, and, theology, in, its, interest, in, the, first, causes, and, the, universe, as, a, whole, key, differences, are, that, metaphysics, relies, on, rational, inquiry, while, physical, cosmology, gives, more, weight, to, empirical, observations, and, theology, is, additionally, based, on, divine, revelation, and, faith, based, doctrines, historically, cosmology, and, theology, were, considered, subfields, of, metaphysics, metaphysics, in, the, form, of, ontology, plays, a, central, role, in, computer, science, to, classify, objects, and, formally, represent, information, about, them, unlike, metaphysicians, computer, scientists, are, usually, not, interested, in, providing, a, single, all, encompassing, characterization, of, reality, as, a, whole, but, instead, employ, many, different, ontologies, each, one, concerned, only, with, a, limited, domain, of, entities, for, example, a, college, database, may, use, an, ontology, with, categories, such, as, person, teacher, student, and, exam, to, represent, information, about, academic, activities, ontologies, provide, standards, or, conceptualizations, for, encoding, and, storing, information, in, a, structured, way, which, makes, it, possible, to, use, and, transform, the, information, by, computational, processes, for, a, variety, of, purposes, some, knowledge, bases, integrate, information, belonging, to, various, domains, which, brings, with, it, the, problem, of, handling, data, that, was, formulated, using, different, ontologies, they, do, so, by, providing, an, upper, ontology, that, defines, concepts, on, a, higher, level, of, abstraction, to, apply, to, all, domains, influential, upper, ontologies, include, suggested, upper, merged, ontology, and, basic, formal, ontology, logic, as, the, study, of, correct, reasoning, is, often, used, by, metaphysicians, as, a, tool, to, engage, in, their, inquiry, and, express, insights, using, precise, logical, formulas, another, relation, between, the, two, fields, concerns, the, metaphysical, assumptions, associated, with, logical, systems, many, logical, systems, like, first, order, logic, rely, on, existential, quantifiers, to, express, existential, statements, for, instance, in, the, logical, formula, x, horse, x, displaystyle, exists, x, text, horse, x, the, existential, quantifier, displaystyle, exists, is, applied, to, the, predicate, horse, displaystyle, text, horse, to, express, that, there, are, horses, following, quine, various, metaphysicians, assume, that, existential, quantifiers, carry, ontological, commitments, meaning, that, existential, statements, imply, that, the, entities, over, which, one, quantifies, form, part, of, reality, the, history, of, metaphysics, examines, how, the, inquiry, into, the, basic, structure, of, reality, has, evolved, in, the, course, of, history, metaphysics, has, its, origin, in, speculations, about, the, nature, and, origin, of, the, cosmos, that, go, back, to, ancient, civilizations, in, ancient, india, starting, in, the, 7th, century, bce, the, upanishads, were, written, as, religious, and, philosophical, texts, that, examine, how, ultimate, reality, constitutes, the, ground, of, all, being, they, further, explore, the, nature, of, the, self, and, how, it, can, reach, liberation, by, understanding, ultimate, reality, this, period, also, saw, the, emergence, of, buddhism, in, the, 6th, century, bce, which, denies, the, existence, of, an, independent, self, and, understands, the, world, as, a, cyclic, process, at, about, the, same, time, in, ancient, china, the, school, of, daoism, was, formed, and, explored, the, natural, order, of, the, universe, known, as, dao, and, how, it, is, characterized, by, the, interplay, of, yin, and, yang, as, two, correlated, forces, in, ancient, greece, metaphysics, emerged, in, the, 6th, century, bce, with, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, who, gave, rational, explanations, of, the, whole, cosmos, by, examining, the, first, principles, from, which, everything, arises, following, them, plato, 427, 347, bce, formulated, his, theory, of, forms, which, states, that, eternal, forms, or, ideas, possess, the, highest, kind, of, reality, while, the, material, world, is, only, an, imperfect, reflection, of, them, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, accepted, plato, s, idea, that, there, are, universal, forms, but, held, that, they, cannot, exist, on, their, own, but, depend, on, matter, he, also, proposed, a, system, of, categories, and, developed, a, comprehensive, framework, of, the, natural, world, through, his, theory, of, the, four, causes, starting, in, the, 4th, century, bce, hellenistic, philosophy, explored, the, rational, order, underlying, the, cosmos, and, the, idea, that, it, is, made, up, of, indivisible, atoms, neoplatonism, emerged, towards, the, end, of, the, ancient, period, in, the, 3rd, century, ce, and, introduced, the, idea, of, the, one, as, a, transcendent, and, ineffable, entity, that, is, the, source, of, all, of, creation, meanwhile, in, indian, buddhism, the, madhyamaka, school, developed, the, idea, that, all, phenomena, are, inherently, empty, without, a, permanent, essence, while, the, consciousness, only, doctrine, of, the, yog, c, ra, school, stated, that, experienced, objects, are, mere, transformations, of, consciousness, that, do, not, reflect, external, reality, the, hindu, school, of, samkhya, philosophy, introduced, a, metaphysical, dualism, with, pure, consciousness, and, matter, as, its, fundamental, categories, in, china, the, school, of, xuanxue, explored, metaphysical, problems, such, as, the, contrast, between, being, and, non, being, medieval, western, philosophy, was, strongly, influenced, by, ancient, greek, philosophy, boethius, 477, 524, ce, attempted, to, harmonize, plato, s, and, aristotle, s, theories, of, universals, by, stating, that, universals, can, exist, both, in, matter, and, mind, his, theory, inspired, the, philosophies, of, nominalism, and, conceptualism, as, in, the, thought, of, peter, abelard, 1079, 1142, ce, thomas, aquinas, 1224, 1274, ce, understood, metaphysics, as, the, discipline, that, investigates, the, different, meanings, of, being, such, as, the, contrast, between, substance, and, accident, and, principles, applying, to, all, beings, such, as, the, principle, of, identity, william, of, ockham, 1285, 1347, ce, proposed, the, methodological, principles, of, ockham, s, razor, as, a, tool, to, decide, between, competing, metaphysical, theories, arabic, persian, philosophy, which, had, its, prime, period, from, the, early, 9th, century, ce, to, the, late, 12th, century, ce, employed, many, ideas, of, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, to, interpret, and, clarify, the, teachings, of, the, quran, avicenna, 980, 1037, ce, developed, a, comprehensive, philosophical, system, that, examined, the, contrast, between, existence, and, essence, and, distinguished, between, contingent, and, necessary, existence, medieval, india, saw, the, emergence, of, the, monist, school, of, advaita, vedanta, in, the, 8th, century, ce, which, holds, that, everything, is, one, and, that, the, idea, of, many, entities, existing, independently, is, an, illusion, in, china, neo, confucianism, arose, in, the, 9th, century, ce, and, explored, the, concept, of, li, as, the, rational, principle, that, is, the, ground, of, being, and, reflects, the, order, of, the, universe, in, the, early, modern, period, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, developed, a, substance, dualism, according, to, which, body, and, mind, exist, as, independent, entities, that, causally, interact, this, idea, was, rejected, by, baruch, spinoza, 1632, 1677, who, formulated, a, monist, philosophy, according, to, which, there, is, only, one, substance, that, has, both, physical, and, mental, attributes, developing, side, by, side, without, interacting, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, 1646, 1716, introduced, the, concept, of, possible, worlds, and, articulated, a, metaphysical, system, known, as, monadology, that, understands, the, universe, as, a, collection, of, simple, substances, that, are, synchronized, without, causally, interacting, with, one, another, christian, wolff, 1679, 1754, conceptualized, the, scope, of, metaphysics, by, introducing, the, distinction, between, general, and, special, metaphysics, according, to, the, idealism, of, george, berkeley, 1685, 1753, everything, is, mental, including, material, objects, which, are, ideas, perceived, by, the, mind, david, hume, 1711, 1776, made, various, contributions, to, metaphysics, including, the, regularity, theory, of, causation, and, the, idea, that, there, are, no, necessary, connections, between, distinct, entities, at, the, same, time, his, empiricist, outlook, led, him, to, formulate, a, stark, criticism, of, metaphysical, theories, that, aim, to, arrive, at, ultimate, principles, inaccessible, to, sensory, experience, this, skeptical, outlook, was, embraced, by, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, he, tried, to, reconceptualize, metaphysics, as, an, inquiry, into, the, basic, principles, and, categories, of, thought, and, understanding, rather, than, seeing, it, as, an, attempt, to, comprehend, mind, independent, reality, many, developments, in, the, later, modern, period, were, shaped, by, kant, s, philosophy, german, idealists, employed, his, idealistic, outlook, in, their, attempt, to, find, a, unifying, principle, as, the, foundation, of, all, reality, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, developed, a, comprehensive, system, of, philosophy, that, examines, how, absolute, spirit, manifests, itself, he, inspired, the, british, idealism, of, francis, herbert, bradley, 1846, 1924, who, interpreted, absolute, spirit, as, the, all, inclusive, totality, of, being, arthur, schopenhauer, 1788, 1860, was, a, strong, critic, of, german, idealism, and, articulated, a, different, metaphysical, vision, that, takes, a, blind, and, irrational, will, as, the, underlying, principle, of, reality, pragmatists, like, c, s, peirce, 1839, 1914, and, john, dewey, 1859, 1952, conceived, metaphysics, as, an, observational, science, of, the, most, general, features, of, reality, and, experience, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, in, analytic, philosophy, philosophers, like, bertrand, russell, 1872, 1970, and, george, edward, moore, s, 1873, 1958, led, a, revolt, against, idealism, logical, atomists, like, russell, and, the, early, ludwig, wittgenstein, 1889, 1951, conceived, the, world, as, a, multitude, of, atomic, facts, which, inspired, later, metaphysicians, such, as, d, m, armstrong, 1926, 2014, alfred, north, whitehead, 1861, 1947, developed, process, metaphysics, as, an, attempt, to, provide, a, holistic, description, of, both, the, objective, and, the, subjective, worlds, rudolf, carnap, 1891, 1970, and, other, logical, positivists, formulated, a, wide, ranging, criticism, of, metaphysical, statements, by, holding, that, they, are, meaningless, since, there, is, no, way, to, verify, them, other, criticisms, of, traditional, metaphysics, identified, misunderstandings, of, ordinary, language, as, the, source, of, many, traditional, metaphysical, problems, or, challenged, complex, metaphysical, deductions, by, relying, on, common, sense, the, decline, of, logical, positivism, saw, a, revival, of, metaphysical, theorizing, willard, van, orman, quine, 1908, 2000, tried, to, naturalize, metaphysics, by, connecting, it, to, the, empirical, sciences, his, student, david, lewis, 1941, 2001, employed, the, concept, of, possible, worlds, to, formulate, his, modal, realism, saul, kripke, 1940, 2022, helped, revive, discussions, of, identity, and, essentialism, and, distinguished, necessity, as, a, metaphysical, notion, from, the, epistemic, notion, of, a, priori, in, continental, philosophy, edmund, husserl, 1859, 1938, engaged, in, ontology, through, a, phenomenological, description, of, experience, while, his, student, martin, heidegger, 1889, 1976, developed, fundamental, ontology, as, an, attempt, to, clarify, the, meaning, of, being, heidegger, s, philosophy, inspired, general, criticisms, of, metaphysics, by, postmodern, thinkers, like, jacques, derrida, 1930, 2004, gilles, deleuze, s, 1925, 1995, approach, to, metaphysics, challenged, traditionally, influential, concepts, like, substance, essence, and, identity, by, reconceptualizing, the, field, through, alternative, notions, such, as, multiplicity, event, and, difference
