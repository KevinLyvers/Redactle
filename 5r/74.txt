reality, is, the, sum, or, aggregate, of, all, that, is, real, or, existent, within, the, universe, as, opposed, to, that, which, is, only, imaginary, nonexistent, or, nonactual, the, term, is, also, used, to, refer, to, the, ontological, status, of, things, indicating, their, existence, in, physical, terms, reality, is, the, totality, of, a, system, known, and, unknown, philosophical, questions, about, the, nature, of, reality, or, existence, or, being, are, considered, under, the, rubric, of, ontology, which, is, a, major, branch, of, metaphysics, in, the, western, philosophical, tradition, ontological, questions, also, feature, in, diverse, branches, of, philosophy, including, the, philosophy, of, science, of, religion, of, mathematics, and, philosophical, logic, these, include, questions, about, whether, only, physical, objects, are, real, i, e, physicalism, whether, reality, is, fundamentally, immaterial, e, g, idealism, whether, hypothetical, unobservable, entities, posited, by, scientific, theories, exist, whether, a, god, or, gods, exist, whether, numbers, and, other, abstract, objects, exist, and, whether, possible, worlds, exist, epistemology, is, concerned, with, what, can, be, known, or, inferred, as, likely, and, how, whereby, in, the, modern, world, emphasis, is, put, on, reason, empirical, evidence, and, science, as, sources, and, methods, to, determine, or, investigate, reality, a, common, colloquial, usage, would, have, reality, mean, perceptions, beliefs, and, attitudes, toward, reality, as, in, my, reality, is, not, your, reality, this, is, often, used, just, as, a, colloquialism, indicating, that, the, parties, to, a, conversation, agree, or, should, agree, not, to, quibble, over, deeply, different, conceptions, of, what, is, real, for, example, in, a, religious, discussion, between, friends, one, might, say, attempting, humor, you, might, disagree, but, in, my, reality, everyone, goes, to, heaven, reality, can, be, defined, in, a, way, that, links, it, to, worldviews, or, parts, of, them, conceptual, frameworks, reality, is, the, totality, of, all, things, structures, actual, and, conceptual, events, past, and, present, and, phenomena, whether, observable, or, not, it, is, what, a, world, view, whether, it, be, based, on, individual, or, shared, human, experience, ultimately, attempts, to, describe, or, map, certain, ideas, from, physics, philosophy, sociology, literary, criticism, and, other, fields, shape, various, theories, of, reality, one, such, theory, is, that, there, simply, and, literally, is, no, reality, beyond, the, perceptions, or, beliefs, we, each, have, about, reality, such, attitudes, are, summarized, in, popular, statements, such, as, perception, is, reality, or, life, is, how, you, perceive, reality, or, reality, is, what, you, can, get, away, with, robert, anton, wilson, and, they, indicate, anti, realism, that, is, the, view, that, there, is, no, objective, reality, whether, acknowledged, explicitly, or, not, many, of, the, concepts, of, science, and, philosophy, are, often, defined, culturally, and, socially, this, idea, was, elaborated, by, thomas, kuhn, in, his, book, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, 1962, the, social, construction, of, reality, a, book, about, the, sociology, of, knowledge, written, by, peter, l, berger, and, thomas, luckmann, was, published, in, 1966, it, explained, how, knowledge, is, acquired, and, used, for, the, comprehension, of, reality, out, of, all, the, realities, the, reality, of, everyday, life, is, the, most, important, one, since, our, consciousness, requires, us, to, be, completely, aware, and, attentive, to, the, experience, of, everyday, life, in, philosophy, potentiality, and, actuality, are, a, pair, of, closely, connected, principles, which, aristotle, used, to, analyze, motion, causality, ethics, and, physiology, in, his, physics, metaphysics, nicomachean, ethics, and, de, anima, the, concept, of, potentiality, in, this, context, generally, refers, to, any, possibility, that, a, thing, can, be, said, to, have, aristotle, did, not, consider, all, possibilities, the, same, and, emphasized, the, importance, of, those, that, become, real, of, their, own, accord, when, conditions, are, right, and, nothing, stops, them, a, belief, is, a, subjective, attitude, that, a, proposition, is, true, or, a, state, of, affairs, is, the, case, a, subjective, attitude, is, a, mental, state, of, having, some, stance, take, or, opinion, about, something, in, epistemology, philosophers, use, the, term, belief, to, refer, to, attitudes, about, the, world, which, can, be, either, true, or, false, to, believe, something, is, to, take, it, to, be, true, for, instance, to, believe, that, snow, is, white, is, comparable, to, accepting, the, truth, of, the, proposition, snow, is, white, however, holding, a, belief, does, not, require, active, introspection, for, example, few, individuals, carefully, consider, whether, or, not, the, sun, will, rise, tomorrow, simply, assuming, that, it, will, moreover, beliefs, need, not, be, occurrent, e, g, a, person, actively, thinking, snow, is, white, but, can, instead, be, dispositional, e, g, a, person, who, if, asked, about, the, color, of, snow, would, assert, snow, is, white, there, are, various, ways, that, contemporary, philosophers, have, tried, to, describe, beliefs, including, as, representations, of, ways, that, the, world, could, be, jerry, fodor, as, dispositions, to, act, as, if, certain, things, are, true, roderick, chisholm, as, interpretive, schemes, for, making, sense, of, someone, s, actions, daniel, dennett, and, donald, davidson, or, as, mental, states, that, fill, a, particular, function, hilary, putnam, some, have, also, attempted, to, offer, significant, revisions, to, our, notion, of, belief, including, eliminativists, about, belief, who, argue, that, there, is, no, phenomenon, in, the, natural, world, which, corresponds, to, our, folk, psychological, concept, of, belief, paul, churchland, and, formal, epistemologists, who, aim, to, replace, our, bivalent, notion, of, belief, either, we, have, a, belief, or, we, don, t, have, a, belief, with, the, more, permissive, probabilistic, notion, of, credence, there, is, an, entire, spectrum, of, degrees, of, belief, not, a, simple, dichotomy, between, belief, and, non, belief, philosophy, addresses, two, different, aspects, of, the, topic, of, reality, the, nature, of, reality, itself, and, the, relationship, between, the, mind, as, well, as, language, and, culture, and, reality, on, the, one, hand, ontology, is, the, study, of, being, and, the, central, topic, of, the, field, is, couched, variously, in, terms, of, being, existence, what, is, and, reality, the, task, in, ontology, is, to, describe, the, most, general, categories, of, reality, and, how, they, are, interrelated, if, a, philosopher, wanted, to, proffer, a, positive, definition, of, the, concept, reality, it, would, be, done, under, this, heading, as, explained, above, some, philosophers, draw, a, distinction, between, reality, and, existence, in, fact, many, analytic, philosophers, today, tend, to, avoid, the, term, real, and, reality, in, discussing, ontological, issues, but, for, those, who, would, treat, is, real, the, same, way, they, treat, exists, one, of, the, leading, questions, of, analytic, philosophy, has, been, whether, existence, or, reality, is, a, property, of, objects, it, has, been, widely, held, by, analytic, philosophers, that, it, is, not, a, property, at, all, though, this, view, has, lost, some, ground, in, recent, decades, on, the, other, hand, particularly, in, discussions, of, objectivity, that, have, feet, in, both, metaphysics, and, epistemology, philosophical, discussions, of, reality, often, concern, the, ways, in, which, reality, is, or, is, not, in, some, way, dependent, upon, or, to, use, fashionable, jargon, constructed, out, of, mental, and, cultural, factors, such, as, perceptions, beliefs, and, other, mental, states, as, well, as, cultural, artifacts, such, as, religions, and, political, movements, on, up, to, the, vague, notion, of, a, common, cultural, world, view, or, weltanschauung, the, view, that, there, is, a, reality, independent, of, any, beliefs, perceptions, etc, is, called, realism, more, specifically, philosophers, are, given, to, speaking, about, realism, about, this, and, that, such, as, realism, about, universals, or, realism, about, the, external, world, generally, where, one, can, identify, any, class, of, object, the, existence, or, essential, characteristics, of, which, is, said, not, to, depend, on, perceptions, beliefs, language, or, any, other, human, artifact, one, can, speak, of, realism, about, that, object, a, correspondence, theory, of, knowledge, about, what, exists, claims, that, true, knowledge, of, reality, represents, accurate, correspondence, of, statements, about, and, images, of, reality, with, the, actual, reality, that, the, statements, or, images, are, attempting, to, represent, for, example, the, scientific, method, can, verify, that, a, statement, is, true, based, on, the, observable, evidence, that, a, thing, exists, many, humans, can, point, to, the, rocky, mountains, and, say, that, this, mountain, range, exists, and, continues, to, exist, even, if, no, one, is, observing, it, or, making, statements, about, it, one, can, also, speak, of, anti, realism, about, the, same, objects, anti, realism, is, the, latest, in, a, long, series, of, terms, for, views, opposed, to, realism, perhaps, the, first, was, idealism, so, called, because, reality, was, said, to, be, in, the, mind, or, a, product, of, our, ideas, berkeleyan, idealism, is, the, view, propounded, by, the, irish, empiricist, george, berkeley, that, the, objects, of, perception, are, actually, ideas, in, the, mind, in, this, view, one, might, be, tempted, to, say, that, reality, is, a, mental, construct, this, is, not, quite, accurate, however, since, in, berkeley, s, view, perceptual, ideas, are, created, and, coordinated, by, god, by, the, 20th, century, views, similar, to, berkeley, s, were, called, phenomenalism, phenomenalism, differs, from, berkeleyan, idealism, primarily, in, that, berkeley, believed, that, minds, or, souls, are, not, merely, ideas, nor, made, up, of, ideas, whereas, varieties, of, phenomenalism, such, as, that, advocated, by, russell, tended, to, go, farther, to, say, that, the, mind, itself, is, merely, a, collection, of, perceptions, memories, etc, and, that, there, is, no, mind, or, soul, over, and, above, such, mental, events, finally, anti, realism, became, a, fashionable, term, for, any, view, which, held, that, the, existence, of, some, object, depends, upon, the, mind, or, cultural, artifacts, the, view, that, the, so, called, external, world, is, really, merely, a, social, or, cultural, artifact, called, social, constructionism, is, one, variety, of, anti, realism, cultural, relativism, is, the, view, that, social, issues, such, as, morality, are, not, absolute, but, at, least, partially, cultural, artifact, the, nature, of, being, is, a, perennial, topic, in, metaphysics, for, instance, parmenides, taught, that, reality, was, a, single, unchanging, being, whereas, heraclitus, wrote, that, all, things, flow, the, 20th, century, philosopher, heidegger, thought, previous, philosophers, have, lost, sight, of, the, question, of, being, qua, being, in, favour, of, the, questions, of, beings, existing, things, so, he, believed, that, a, return, to, the, parmenidean, approach, was, needed, an, ontological, catalogue, is, an, attempt, to, list, the, fundamental, constituents, of, reality, the, question, of, whether, or, not, existence, is, a, predicate, has, been, discussed, since, the, early, modern, period, not, least, in, relation, to, the, ontological, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, existence, that, something, is, has, been, contrasted, with, essence, the, question, of, what, something, is, since, existence, without, essence, seems, blank, it, associated, with, nothingness, by, philosophers, such, as, hegel, nihilism, represents, an, extremely, negative, view, of, being, the, absolute, a, positive, one, the, question, of, direct, or, na, ve, realism, as, opposed, to, indirect, or, representational, realism, arises, in, the, philosophy, of, perception, and, of, mind, out, of, the, debate, over, the, nature, of, conscious, experience, the, epistemological, question, of, whether, the, world, we, see, around, us, is, the, real, world, itself, or, merely, an, internal, perceptual, copy, of, that, world, generated, by, neural, processes, in, our, brain, na, ve, realism, is, known, as, direct, realism, when, developed, to, counter, indirect, or, representative, realism, also, known, as, epistemological, dualism, the, philosophical, position, that, our, conscious, experience, is, not, of, the, real, world, itself, but, of, an, internal, representation, a, miniature, virtual, reality, replica, of, the, world, timothy, leary, coined, the, influential, term, reality, tunnel, by, which, he, means, a, kind, of, representative, realism, the, theory, states, that, with, a, subconscious, set, of, mental, filters, formed, from, their, beliefs, and, experiences, every, individual, interprets, the, same, world, differently, hence, truth, is, in, the, eye, of, the, beholder, his, ideas, influenced, the, work, of, his, friend, robert, anton, wilson, the, status, of, abstract, entities, particularly, numbers, is, a, topic, of, discussion, in, mathematics, in, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, the, best, known, form, of, realism, about, numbers, is, platonic, realism, which, grants, them, abstract, immaterial, existence, other, forms, of, realism, identify, mathematics, with, the, concrete, physical, universe, anti, realist, stances, include, formalism, and, fictionalism, some, approaches, are, selectively, realistic, about, some, mathematical, objects, but, not, others, finitism, rejects, infinite, quantities, ultra, finitism, accepts, finite, quantities, up, to, a, certain, amount, constructivism, and, intuitionism, are, realistic, about, objects, that, can, be, explicitly, constructed, but, reject, the, use, of, the, principle, of, the, excluded, middle, to, prove, existence, by, reductio, ad, absurdum, the, traditional, debate, has, focused, on, whether, an, abstract, immaterial, intelligible, realm, of, numbers, has, existed, in, addition, to, the, physical, sensible, concrete, world, a, recent, development, is, the, mathematical, universe, hypothesis, the, theory, that, only, a, mathematical, world, exists, with, the, finite, physical, world, being, an, illusion, within, it, an, extreme, form, of, realism, about, mathematics, is, the, mathematical, multiverse, hypothesis, advanced, by, max, tegmark, tegmark, s, sole, postulate, is, all, structures, that, exist, mathematically, also, exist, physically, that, is, in, the, sense, that, in, those, complex, enough, to, contain, self, aware, substructures, will, subjectively, perceive, themselves, as, existing, in, a, physically, real, world, the, hypothesis, suggests, that, worlds, corresponding, to, different, sets, of, initial, conditions, physical, constants, or, altogether, different, equations, should, be, considered, real, the, theory, can, be, considered, a, form, of, platonism, in, that, it, posits, the, existence, of, mathematical, entities, but, can, also, be, considered, a, mathematical, monism, in, that, it, denies, that, anything, exists, except, mathematical, objects, the, problem, of, universals, is, an, ancient, problem, in, metaphysics, about, whether, universals, exist, universals, are, general, or, abstract, qualities, characteristics, properties, kinds, or, relations, such, as, being, male, female, solid, liquid, gas, or, a, certain, colour, that, can, be, predicated, of, individuals, or, particulars, or, that, individuals, or, particulars, can, be, regarded, as, sharing, or, participating, in, for, example, scott, pat, and, chris, have, in, common, the, universal, quality, of, being, human, or, humanity, the, realist, school, claims, that, universals, are, real, they, exist, and, are, distinct, from, the, particulars, that, instantiate, them, there, are, various, forms, of, realism, two, major, forms, are, platonic, realism, and, aristotelian, realism, platonic, realism, is, the, view, that, universals, are, real, entities, and, they, exist, independent, of, particulars, aristotelian, realism, on, the, other, hand, is, the, view, that, universals, are, real, entities, but, their, existence, is, dependent, on, the, particulars, that, exemplify, them, nominalism, and, conceptualism, are, the, main, forms, of, anti, realism, about, universals, a, traditional, realist, position, in, ontology, is, that, time, and, space, have, existence, apart, from, the, human, mind, idealists, deny, or, doubt, the, existence, of, objects, independent, of, the, mind, some, anti, realists, whose, ontological, position, is, that, objects, outside, the, mind, do, exist, nevertheless, doubt, the, independent, existence, of, time, and, space, kant, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, described, time, as, an, a, priori, notion, that, together, with, other, a, priori, notions, such, as, space, allows, us, to, comprehend, sense, experience, kant, denies, that, either, space, or, time, are, substance, entities, in, themselves, or, learned, by, experience, he, holds, rather, that, both, are, elements, of, a, systematic, framework, we, use, to, structure, our, experience, spatial, measurements, are, used, to, quantify, how, far, apart, objects, are, and, temporal, measurements, are, used, to, quantitatively, compare, the, interval, between, or, duration, of, events, although, space, and, time, are, held, to, be, transcendentally, ideal, in, this, sense, they, are, also, empirically, real, i, e, not, mere, illusions, idealist, writers, such, as, j, m, e, mctaggart, in, the, unreality, of, time, have, argued, that, time, is, an, illusion, as, well, as, differing, about, the, reality, of, time, as, a, whole, metaphysical, theories, of, time, can, differ, in, their, ascriptions, of, reality, to, the, past, present, and, future, separately, time, and, the, related, concepts, of, process, and, evolution, are, central, to, the, system, building, metaphysics, of, a, n, whitehead, and, charles, hartshorne, the, term, possible, world, goes, back, to, leibniz, s, theory, of, possible, worlds, used, to, analyse, necessity, possibility, and, similar, modal, notions, modal, realism, is, the, view, notably, propounded, by, david, kellogg, lewis, that, all, possible, worlds, are, as, real, as, the, actual, world, in, short, the, actual, world, is, regarded, as, merely, one, among, an, infinite, set, of, logically, possible, worlds, some, nearer, to, the, actual, world, and, some, more, remote, other, theorists, may, use, the, possible, world, framework, to, express, and, explore, problems, without, committing, to, it, ontologically, possible, world, theory, is, related, to, alethic, logic, a, proposition, is, necessary, if, it, is, true, in, all, possible, worlds, and, possible, if, it, is, true, in, at, least, one, the, many, worlds, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, is, a, similar, idea, in, science, the, philosophical, implications, of, a, physical, toe, are, frequently, debated, for, example, if, philosophical, physicalism, is, true, a, physical, toe, will, coincide, with, a, philosophical, theory, of, everything, the, system, building, style, of, metaphysics, attempts, to, answer, all, the, important, questions, in, a, coherent, way, providing, a, complete, picture, of, the, world, plato, and, aristotle, could, be, said, to, be, early, examples, of, comprehensive, systems, in, the, early, modern, period, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, system, building, scope, of, philosophy, is, often, linked, to, the, rationalist, method, of, philosophy, that, is, the, technique, of, deducing, the, nature, of, the, world, by, pure, a, priori, reason, examples, from, the, early, modern, period, include, the, leibniz, s, monadology, descartes, s, dualism, spinoza, s, monism, hegel, s, absolute, idealism, and, whitehead, s, process, philosophy, were, later, systems, other, philosophers, do, not, believe, its, techniques, can, aim, so, high, some, scientists, think, a, more, mathematical, approach, than, philosophy, is, needed, for, a, toe, for, instance, stephen, hawking, wrote, in, a, brief, history, of, time, that, even, if, we, had, a, toe, it, would, necessarily, be, a, set, of, equations, he, wrote, what, is, it, that, breathes, fire, into, the, equations, and, makes, a, universe, for, them, to, describe, on, a, much, broader, and, more, subjective, level, private, experiences, curiosity, inquiry, and, the, selectivity, involved, in, personal, interpretation, of, events, shapes, reality, as, seen, by, one, and, only, one, person, and, hence, is, called, phenomenological, while, this, form, of, reality, might, be, common, to, others, as, well, it, could, at, times, also, be, so, unique, to, oneself, as, to, never, be, experienced, or, agreed, upon, by, anyone, else, much, of, the, kind, of, experience, deemed, spiritual, occurs, on, this, level, of, reality, phenomenology, is, a, philosophical, method, developed, in, the, early, years, of, the, twentieth, century, by, edmund, husserl, 1859, 1938, and, a, circle, of, followers, at, the, universities, of, g, ttingen, and, munich, in, germany, subsequently, phenomenological, themes, were, taken, up, by, philosophers, in, france, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, often, in, contexts, far, removed, from, husserl, s, work, the, word, phenomenology, comes, from, the, greek, phain, menon, meaning, that, which, appears, and, l, gos, meaning, study, in, husserl, s, conception, phenomenology, is, primarily, concerned, with, making, the, structures, of, consciousness, and, the, phenomena, which, appear, in, acts, of, consciousness, objects, of, systematic, reflection, and, analysis, such, reflection, was, to, take, place, from, a, highly, modified, first, person, viewpoint, studying, phenomena, not, as, they, appear, to, my, consciousness, but, to, any, consciousness, whatsoever, husserl, believed, that, phenomenology, could, thus, provide, a, firm, basis, for, all, human, knowledge, including, scientific, knowledge, and, could, establish, philosophy, as, a, rigorous, science, husserl, s, conception, of, phenomenology, has, been, criticised, and, developed, by, his, student, and, assistant, martin, heidegger, 1889, 1976, by, existentialists, like, maurice, merleau, ponty, 1908, 1961, and, jean, paul, sartre, 1905, 1980, and, by, other, philosophers, such, as, paul, ricoeur, 1913, 2005, emmanuel, levinas, 1906, 1995, and, dietrich, von, hildebrand, 1889, 1977, skeptical, hypotheses, in, philosophy, suggest, that, reality, could, be, very, different, from, what, we, think, it, is, or, at, least, that, we, cannot, prove, it, is, not, examples, include, jain, philosophy, postulates, that, seven, tattva, truths, or, fundamental, principles, constitute, reality, these, seven, tattva, are, scientific, realism, is, at, the, most, general, level, the, view, that, the, world, the, universe, described, by, science, perhaps, ideal, science, is, the, real, world, as, it, is, independent, of, what, we, might, take, it, to, be, within, philosophy, of, science, it, is, often, framed, as, an, answer, to, the, question, how, is, the, success, of, science, to, be, explained, the, debate, over, what, the, success, of, science, involves, centers, primarily, on, the, status, of, entities, that, are, not, directly, observable, discussed, by, scientific, theories, generally, those, who, are, scientific, realists, state, that, one, can, make, reliable, claims, about, these, entities, viz, that, they, have, the, same, ontological, status, as, directly, observable, entities, as, opposed, to, instrumentalism, the, most, used, and, studied, scientific, theories, today, state, more, or, less, the, truth, realism, in, the, sense, used, by, physicists, does, not, equate, to, realism, in, metaphysics, the, latter, is, the, claim, that, the, world, is, mind, independent, that, even, if, the, results, of, a, measurement, do, not, pre, exist, the, act, of, measurement, that, does, not, require, that, they, are, the, creation, of, the, observer, furthermore, a, mind, independent, property, does, not, have, to, be, the, value, of, some, physical, variable, such, as, position, or, momentum, a, property, can, be, dispositional, or, potential, i, e, it, can, be, a, tendency, in, the, way, that, glass, objects, tend, to, break, or, are, disposed, to, break, even, if, they, do, not, actually, break, likewise, the, mind, independent, properties, of, quantum, systems, could, consist, of, a, tendency, to, respond, to, particular, measurements, with, particular, values, with, ascertainable, probability, such, an, ontology, would, be, metaphysically, realistic, without, being, realistic, in, the, physicist, s, sense, of, local, realism, which, would, require, that, a, single, value, be, produced, with, certainty, a, closely, related, term, is, counterfactual, definiteness, cfd, used, to, refer, to, the, claim, that, one, can, meaningfully, speak, of, the, definiteness, of, results, of, measurements, that, have, not, been, performed, i, e, the, ability, to, assume, the, existence, of, objects, and, properties, of, objects, even, when, they, have, not, been, measured, local, realism, is, a, significant, feature, of, classical, mechanics, of, general, relativity, and, of, electrodynamics, but, quantum, mechanics, has, shown, that, quantum, entanglement, is, possible, this, was, rejected, by, einstein, who, proposed, the, epr, paradox, but, it, was, subsequently, quantified, by, bell, s, inequalities, if, bell, s, inequalities, are, violated, either, local, realism, or, counterfactual, definiteness, must, be, incorrect, but, some, physicists, dispute, that, experiments, have, demonstrated, bell, s, violations, on, the, grounds, that, the, sub, class, of, inhomogeneous, bell, inequalities, has, not, been, tested, or, due, to, experimental, limitations, in, the, tests, different, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, violate, different, parts, of, local, realism, and, or, counterfactual, definiteness, the, transition, from, possible, to, actual, is, a, major, topic, of, quantum, physics, with, related, theories, including, quantum, darwinism, the, quantum, mind, body, problem, refers, to, the, philosophical, discussions, of, the, mind, body, problem, in, the, context, of, quantum, mechanics, since, quantum, mechanics, involves, quantum, superpositions, which, are, not, perceived, by, observers, some, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, place, conscious, observers, in, a, special, position, the, founders, of, quantum, mechanics, debated, the, role, of, the, observer, and, of, them, wolfgang, pauli, and, werner, heisenberg, believed, that, it, was, the, observer, that, produced, collapse, this, point, of, view, which, was, never, fully, endorsed, by, niels, bohr, was, denounced, as, mystical, and, anti, scientific, by, albert, einstein, pauli, accepted, the, term, and, described, quantum, mechanics, as, lucid, mysticism, heisenberg, and, bohr, always, described, quantum, mechanics, in, logical, positivist, terms, bohr, also, took, an, active, interest, in, the, philosophical, implications, of, quantum, theories, such, as, his, complementarity, for, example, he, believed, quantum, theory, offers, a, complete, description, of, nature, albeit, one, that, is, simply, ill, suited, for, everyday, experiences, which, are, better, described, by, classical, mechanics, and, probability, bohr, never, specified, a, demarcation, line, above, which, objects, cease, to, be, quantum, and, become, classical, he, believed, that, it, was, not, a, question, of, physics, but, one, of, philosophy, eugene, wigner, reformulated, the, schr, dinger, s, cat, thought, experiment, as, wigner, s, friend, and, proposed, that, the, consciousness, of, an, observer, is, the, demarcation, line, which, precipitates, collapse, of, the, wave, function, independent, of, any, realist, interpretation, commonly, known, as, consciousness, causes, collapse, this, controversial, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, states, that, observation, by, a, conscious, observer, is, what, makes, the, wave, function, collapse, however, this, is, a, minority, view, among, quantum, philosophers, considering, it, a, misunderstanding, there, are, other, possible, solutions, to, the, wigner, s, friend, thought, experiment, which, do, not, require, consciousness, to, be, different, from, other, physical, processes, moreover, wigner, shifted, to, those, interpretations, in, his, later, years, the, multiverse, is, the, hypothetical, set, of, multiple, possible, universes, including, the, historical, universe, we, consistently, experience, that, together, comprise, everything, that, exists, the, entirety, of, space, time, matter, and, energy, as, well, as, the, physical, laws, and, constants, that, describe, them, the, term, was, coined, in, 1895, by, the, american, philosopher, and, psychologist, william, james, in, the, many, worlds, interpretation, mwi, one, of, the, mainstream, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, there, are, an, infinite, number, of, universes, and, every, possible, quantum, outcome, occurs, in, at, least, one, universe, albeit, there, is, a, debate, as, to, how, real, the, other, worlds, are, the, structure, of, the, multiverse, the, nature, of, each, universe, within, it, and, the, relationship, between, the, various, constituent, universes, depend, on, the, specific, multiverse, hypothesis, considered, multiverses, have, been, hypothesized, in, cosmology, physics, astronomy, religion, philosophy, transpersonal, psychology, and, fiction, particularly, in, science, fiction, and, fantasy, in, these, contexts, parallel, universes, are, also, called, alternative, universes, quantum, universes, interpenetrating, dimensions, parallel, dimensions, parallel, worlds, alternative, realities, alternative, timelines, and, dimensional, planes, among, others, each, individual, has, a, different, view, of, reality, with, different, memories, and, personal, history, knowledge, personality, traits, and, experience, this, system, mostly, referring, to, the, human, brain, affects, cognition, and, behavior, and, into, this, complex, new, knowledge, memories, information, thoughts, and, experiences, are, continuously, integrated, the, connectome, neural, networks, wirings, in, brains, is, thought, to, be, a, key, factor, in, human, variability, in, terms, of, cognition, or, the, way, we, perceive, the, world, as, a, context, and, related, features, or, processes, sensemaking, is, the, process, by, which, people, give, meaning, to, their, experiences, and, make, sense, of, the, world, they, live, in, personal, identity, is, relating, to, questions, like, how, a, unique, individual, is, persisting, through, time, sensemaking, and, determination, of, reality, also, occurs, collectively, which, is, investigated, in, social, epistemology, and, related, approaches, from, the, collective, intelligence, perspective, the, intelligence, of, the, individual, human, and, potentially, ai, entities, is, substantially, limited, and, advanced, intelligence, emerges, when, multiple, entities, collaborate, over, time, collective, memory, is, an, important, component, of, the, social, construction, of, reality, and, communication, and, communication, related, systems, such, as, media, systems, may, also, be, major, components, see, technology, philosophy, of, perception, raises, questions, based, on, the, evolutionary, history, of, humans, perceptual, apparatuses, particularly, or, especially, individuals, physiological, senses, described, as, e, don, t, see, reality, we, only, see, what, was, useful, to, see, in, the, past, partly, suggesting, that, ur, species, has, been, so, successful, not, in, spite, of, our, inability, to, see, reality, but, because, of, it, a, theory, of, everything, toe, is, a, putative, theory, of, theoretical, physics, that, fully, explains, and, links, together, all, known, physical, phenomena, and, predicts, the, outcome, of, any, experiment, that, could, be, carried, out, in, principle, the, theory, of, everything, is, also, called, the, final, theory, many, candidate, theories, of, everything, have, been, proposed, by, theoretical, physicists, during, the, twentieth, century, but, none, have, been, confirmed, experimentally, the, primary, problem, in, producing, a, toe, is, that, general, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, are, hard, to, unify, this, is, one, of, the, unsolved, problems, in, physics, initially, the, term, theory, of, everything, was, used, with, an, ironic, connotation, to, refer, to, various, overgeneralized, theories, for, example, a, great, grandfather, of, ijon, tichy, a, character, from, a, cycle, of, stanis, aw, lem, s, science, fiction, stories, of, the, 1960s, was, known, to, work, on, the, general, theory, of, everything, physicist, john, ellis, claims, to, have, introduced, the, term, into, the, technical, literature, in, an, article, in, nature, in, 1986, over, time, the, term, stuck, in, popularizations, of, quantum, physics, to, describe, a, theory, that, would, unify, or, explain, through, a, single, model, the, theories, of, all, fundamental, interactions, and, of, all, particles, of, nature, general, relativity, for, gravitation, and, the, standard, model, of, elementary, particle, physics, which, includes, quantum, mechanics, for, electromagnetism, the, two, nuclear, interactions, and, the, known, elementary, particles, current, candidates, for, a, theory, of, everything, include, string, theory, m, theory, and, loop, quantum, gravity, media, such, as, news, media, social, media, websites, including, wikipedia, and, fiction, shape, individuals, and, society, s, perception, of, reality, including, as, part, of, belief, and, attitude, formation, and, are, partly, used, intentionally, as, means, to, learn, about, reality, various, technologies, have, changed, society, s, relationship, with, reality, such, as, the, advent, of, radio, and, tv, technologies, research, investigates, interrelations, and, effects, for, example, aspects, in, the, social, construction, of, reality, a, major, component, of, this, shaping, and, representation, of, perceived, reality, is, agenda, selection, and, prioritization, not, only, or, primarily, the, quality, tone, and, types, of, content, which, influences, for, instance, the, public, agenda, disproportional, news, attention, for, low, probability, incidents, such, as, high, consequence, accidents, can, distort, audiences, risk, perceptions, with, harmful, consequences, various, biases, such, as, false, balance, public, attention, dependence, reactions, like, sensationalism, and, domination, by, current, events, as, well, as, various, interest, driven, uses, of, media, such, as, marketing, can, also, have, major, impacts, on, the, perception, of, reality, time, use, studies, found, that, e, g, in, 2018, the, average, u, s, american, spent, around, eleven, hours, every, day, looking, at, screens, virtual, reality, vr, is, a, computer, simulated, environment, that, can, simulate, physical, presence, in, places, in, the, real, world, as, well, as, in, imaginary, worlds, the, virtuality, continuum, is, a, continuous, scale, ranging, between, the, completely, virtual, a, virtuality, and, the, completely, real, reality, the, reality, virtuality, continuum, therefore, encompasses, all, possible, variations, and, compositions, of, real, and, virtual, objects, it, has, been, described, as, a, concept, in, new, media, and, computer, science, but, in, fact, it, could, be, considered, a, matter, of, anthropology, the, concept, was, first, introduced, by, paul, milgram, the, area, between, the, two, extremes, where, both, the, real, and, the, virtual, are, mixed, is, the, so, called, mixed, reality, this, in, turn, is, said, to, consist, of, both, augmented, reality, where, the, virtual, augments, the, real, and, augmented, virtuality, where, the, real, augments, the, virtual, cyberspace, the, world, s, computer, systems, considered, as, an, interconnected, whole, can, be, thought, of, as, a, virtual, reality, for, instance, it, is, portrayed, as, such, in, the, cyberpunk, fiction, of, william, gibson, and, others, second, life, and, mmorpgs, such, as, world, of, warcraft, are, examples, of, artificial, environments, or, virtual, worlds, falling, some, way, short, of, full, virtual, reality, in, cyberspace, on, the, internet, real, life, refers, to, life, in, the, real, world, it, generally, references, life, or, consensus, reality, in, contrast, to, an, environment, seen, as, fiction, or, fantasy, such, as, virtual, reality, lifelike, experience, dreams, novels, or, movies, online, the, acronym, irl, stands, for, in, real, life, with, the, meaning, not, on, the, internet, sociologists, engaged, in, the, study, of, the, internet, have, determined, that, someday, a, distinction, between, online, and, real, life, worlds, may, seem, quaint, noting, that, certain, types, of, online, activity, such, as, sexual, intrigues, have, already, made, a, full, transition, to, complete, legitimacy, and, reality, the, abbreviation, rl, stands, for, real, life, for, example, one, can, speak, of, meeting, in, rl, someone, whom, one, has, met, in, a, chat, or, on, an, internet, forum, it, may, also, be, used, to, express, an, inability, to, use, the, internet, for, a, time, due, to, rl, problems
