wall, and, per, around, by, the, 6th, 5th, century, bce, the, old, iranian, word, had, been, borrowed, into, assyrian, pardesu, domain, it, subsequently, came, to, indicate, the, expansive, walled, gardens, of, the, first, persian, empire, and, was, subsequently, borrowed, into, greek, as, par, deisos, park, for, animals, in, the, anabasis, of, the, early, 4th, century, bce, athenian, xenophon, aramaic, as, pardaysa, royal, park, and, hebrew, as, pardes, orchard, appearing, thrice, in, the, tanakh, in, the, song, of, solomon, song, of, songs, 4, 13, ecclesiastes, ecclesiastes, 2, 5, and, nehemiah, nehemiah, 2, 8, in, the, septuagint, 3rd, 1st, centuries, bce, greek, par, deisos, was, used, to, translate, both, hebrew, pardes, and, hebrew, gan, garden, e, g, genesis, 2, 8, ezekiel, 28, 13, it, is, from, this, usage, that, the, use, of, paradise, to, refer, to, the, garden, of, eden, derives, the, same, usage, also, appears, in, arabic, and, in, the, quran, as, firdaws, the, idea, of, a, walled, enclosure, was, not, preserved, in, most, iranian, usage, and, generally, came, to, refer, to, a, plantation, or, other, cultivated, area, not, necessarily, walled, for, example, the,

the, fall, of, man, having, been, tricked, by, the, serpent, after, the, death, of, adam, the, archangel, michael, carries, adam, s, body, to, be, buried, in, paradise, in, the, third, heaven, the, greek, word, appears, three, times, in, the, new, testament, according, to, jewish, eschatology, the, higher, gan, eden, is, called, the, garden, of, righteousness, it, has, been, created, since, the, beginning, of, the, world, and, will, appear, gloriously, at, the, end, of, time, the, righteous, dwelling, there, will, enjoy, the, sight, of, the, heavenly, chayot, carrying, the, throne, of, god, each, of, the, righteous, will, walk, with, god, who, will, lead, them, in, a, dance, its, jewish, and, non, jewish, inhabitants, are, clothed, with, garments, of, light, and, eternal, life, and, eat, of, the, tree, of, life, enoch, 58, 3, near, to, god, and, his, anointed, ones, this, jewish, rabbinical, concept, of, a, higher, gan, eden, is, opposed, by, the, hebrew, terms, gehinnom, the, source, via, yiddish, of, the, english, gehenna, and, sheol, figurative, names, for, the, place, of, spiritual, purification, for, the, wicked, dead, in, judaism, a, place, envisioned, as, being, at, the, greatest, possible, distance, from, heaven, in, modern, jewish, eschatology, it, is, believed, that, history, will, complete, itself, and, the, ultimate, destination, will, be, when, all, mankind, returns, to, the, garden, of, eden, in, the, talmud, and, the, jewish, kabbalah, the, scholars, agree, that, there, are, two, types, of, spiritual, places, called, garden, in, eden, the, first, is, rather, terrestrial, of, abundant, fertility, and, luxuriant, vegetation, known, as, the, lower, gan, eden, the, second, is, envisioned, as, being, celestial, the, habitation, of, righteous, jewish, and, non, jewish, immortal, souls, known, as, the, higher, gan, eden, the, rabbis, differentiate, between, gan, and, eden, adam, is, said, to, have, dwelt, only, in, the, gan, whereas, eden, is, said, never, to, be, witnessed, by, any, mortal, eye, in, rabbinic, judaism, the, word, pardes, recurs, but, less, often, in, the, second, temple, context, of, eden, or, restored, eden, a, well, known, reference, is, in, the, pardes, story, where, the, word, may, allude, to, mystic, philosophy, the, zohar, gives, the, word, a, mystical, interpretation, and, associates, it, with, the, four, kinds, of, biblical, exegesis, peshat, literal, meaning, remez, allusion, derash, anagogical, and, sod, mystic, the, initial, letters, of, those, four, words, then, form, p, a, rd, e, s, which, was, in, turn, felt, to, represent, the, fourfold, interpretation, of, the, torah, in, which, sod, the, mystical, interpretation, ranks, highest, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, irenaeus, distinguished, paradise, from, heaven, in, against, heresies, he, wrote, that, only, those, deemed, worthy, would, inherit, a, home, in, heaven, while, others, would, enjoy, paradise, and, the, rest, live, in, the, restored, jerusalem, which, was, mostly, a, ruin, after, the, jewish, roman, wars, but, was, rebuilt, beginning, with, constantine, the, great, in, the, 4th, century, origen, likewise, distinguished, paradise, from, heaven, describing, paradise, as, the, earthly, school, for, souls, of, the, righteous, dead, preparing, them, for, their, ascent, through, the, celestial, spheres, to, heaven, many, early, christians, identified, abraham, s, bosom, with, paradise, where, the, souls, of, the, righteous, go, until, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, others, were, inconsistent, in, their, identification, of, paradise, such, as, st, augustine, whose, views, varied, in, luke, 23, 43, jesus, has, a, conversation, with, one, of, those, crucified, with, him, who, asks, jesus, remember, me, when, you, come, into, your, kingdom, jesus, answers, him, truly, i, tell, you, today, you, will, be, with, me, in, paradise, this, has, often, been, interpreted, to, mean, that, on, that, same, day, the, thief, and, jesus, would, enter, the, intermediate, resting, place, of, the, dead, who, were, waiting, for, the, resurrection, divergent, views, on, paradise, and, when, one, enters, it, may, have, been, responsible, for, a, punctuation, difference, in, luke, for, example, the, two, early, syriac, versions, translate, luke, 23, 43, differently, the, curetonian, gospels, read, today, i, tell, you, that, you, will, be, with, me, in, paradise, whereas, the, sinaitic, palimpsest, reads, i, tell, you, today, you, will, be, with, me, in, paradise, likewise, the, two, earliest, greek, codices, with, punctuation, disagree, codex, vaticanus, has, a, pause, mark, a, single, dot, on, the, baseline, in, the, original, ink, equidistant, between, today, and, the, following, word, with, no, later, corrections, and, no, dot, before, today, whereas, codex, alexandrinus, has, the, today, in, paradise, reading, in, addition, an, adverb, of, time, is, never, used, in, the, nearly, 100, other, places, in, the, gospels, where, jesus, uses, the, phrase, truly, i, say, to, you, in, christian, art, fra, angelico, s, last, judgement, painting, shows, paradise, on, its, left, side, there, is, a, tree, of, life, and, another, tree, and, a, circle, dance, of, liberated, souls, in, the, middle, is, a, hole, in, muslim, art, it, similarly, indicates, the, presence, of, the, prophet, or, divine, beings, it, visually, says, those, here, cannot, be, depicted, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, from, their, interpretation, of, the, book, of, genesis, that, god, s, original, purpose, was, and, is, to, have, the, earth, filled, with, the, offspring, of, adam, and, eve, as, caretakers, of, a, global, paradise, however, adam, and, eve, rebelled, against, god, s, sovereignty, and, were, banished, from, the, garden, of, eden, driven, out, of, paradise, into, toil, and, misery, jehovah, s, witnesses, believe, that, disobedient, and, wicked, people, will, be, destroyed, by, christ, at, armageddon, and, those, obedient, to, christ, will, live, eternally, in, a, restored, earthly, paradise, joining, the, survivors, will, be, the, resurrected, righteous, and, unrighteous, people, who, died, prior, to, armageddon, the, latter, are, brought, back, because, they, paid, for, their, sins, by, their, death, and, or, because, they, lacked, opportunity, to, learn, of, jehovah, s, requirements, before, dying, these, will, be, judged, on, the, basis, of, their, post, resurrection, obedience, to, instructions, revealed, in, new, scrolls, they, believe, that, resurrection, of, the, dead, to, paradise, earth, is, made, possible, by, christ, s, blood, and, the, ransom, sacrifice, this, provision, does, not, apply, to, those, whom, christ, as, judge, deems, to, have, sinned, against, god, s, holy, spirit, one, of, jesus, statements, before, he, died, were, the, words, to, a, man, hanging, alongside, him, you, will, be, with, me, in, paradise, the, new, world, translation, places, a, comma, after, the, word, today, dividing, it, into, two, separate, phrases, i, tell, you, today, and, you, will, be, with, me, in, paradise, this, differs, from, standard, translations, of, this, verse, as, i, tell, you, today, you, will, be, with, me, in, paradise, based, on, scriptures, such, as, matthew, 12, 40, 27, 63, mark, 8, 31, and, 9, 31, witnesses, believe, jesus, expectation, that, he, would, be, bodily, resurrected, after, three, days, precluded, his, being, in, paradise, on, the, same, day, that, he, died, in, latter, day, saint, theology, paradise, usually, refers, to, the, spirit, world, the, place, where, spirits, dwell, following, death, and, awaiting, the, resurrection, in, that, context, paradise, is, the, state, of, the, righteous, after, death, in, contrast, the, wicked, and, those, who, have, not, yet, learned, the, gospel, of, jesus, christ, await, the, resurrection, in, spirit, prison, after, the, universal, resurrection, all, persons, will, be, assigned, to, a, particular, kingdom, or, degree, of, glory, this, may, also, be, termed, paradise, in, the, quran, heaven, is, denoted, as, jannah, garden, with, the, highest, level, being, called, firdaus, i, e, paradise, it, is, used, instead, of, heaven, to, describe, the, ultimate, pleasurable, place, after, death, accessible, by, those, who, pray, donate, to, charity, and, believe, in, allah, the, angels, his, revealed, books, his, prophets, and, messengers, the, day, of, judgement, and, divine, decree, qadr, and, follow, god, s, will, in, their, life, heaven, in, islam, is, used, to, describe, skies, in, the, literal, sense, and, metaphorically, to, refer, to, the, universe, in, islam, the, bounties, and, beauty, of, heaven, are, immense, so, much, so, that, they, are, beyond, the, abilities, of, mankind, s, worldly, mind, to, comprehend, there, are, eight, doors, of, jannah, these, are, eight, grades, of, jannah, jannah, al, mawa, is, in, the, lowest, jannah, al, adn, is, the, middle, and, jannah, al, firdaus, is, the, highest, imam, bukhari, has, also, recorded, the, tradition, in, which, the, prophet, said, when, you, ask, from, allah, ask, him, for, al, firdaus, for, it, is, the, middle, of, paradise, and, it, is, the, highest, place, and, from, it, the, rivers, of, paradise, flow, bukhari, ahmad, baihaqi, in, this, tradition, it, is, evident, that, al, firdaus, is, the, highest, place, in, paradise, yet, it, is, stated, that, it, is, in, the, middle, while, giving, an, explanation, of, this, description, of, al, firdaus, the, great, scholar, ibn, hibban, states, al, firdaus, being, in, the, middle, of, paradise, means, that, with, respect, to, the, width, and, breadth, of, paradise, al, firdaus, is, in, the, middle, and, with, respect, to, being, the, highest, place, in, paradise, it, refers, to, it, being, on, a, height, this, explanation, is, in, agreement, to, the, explanation, which, has, been, given, by, abu, hurairah, r, a, who, said, that, al, firdaus, is, a, mountain, in, paradise, from, which, the, rivers, flow, tafseer, al, qurtubi, vol, 12, pg, 100, the, quran, also, gave, a, warning, that, not, all, muslims, or, even, the, believers, will, assuredly, be, permitted, to, enter, jannah, except, those, who, had, struggled, in, the, name, of, god, and, tested, from, god, s, trials, as, faced, by, the, messengers, of, god, or, ancient, prophets, or, do, you, think, that, you, will, enter, paradise, while, such, has, not, yet, come, to, you, as, came, to, those, who, passed, on, before, you, they, were, touched, by, poverty, and, hardship, and, were, shaken, until, messenger, and, those, who, believed, with, him, said, when, is, the, help, of, allah, unquestionably, the, help, of, allah, is, near, qur, an, 2, 214, al, baqarah, saheeh, international, other, instances, where, paradise, is, mentioned, in, the, qur, an, includes, descriptions, of, springs, silk, garments, embellished, carpets, and, women, with, beautiful, eyes, these, elements, can, also, be, seen, as, depicted, within, islamic, art, and, architecture, the, semblance, of, paradise, jannah, promised, the, pious, and, devout, is, that, of, a, garden, with, streams, of, water, that, will, not, go, rank, and, rivers, of, milk, whose, taste, will, not, undergo, a, change, and, rivers, of, wine, delectable, to, drinkers, and, streams, of, purified, honey, and, fruits, of, every, kind, in, them, and, forgiveness, from, their, lord, 47, 15, the, qur, an, contains, multiple, passages, in, which, paradise, or, jannah, is, referred, to, the, holy, book, contains, 166, references, to, gardens, of, which, nineteen, mention, jannah, connoting, both, images, of, paradise, through, gardens, water, features, and, fruit, bearing, trees, scholars, are, unable, to, confirm, that, certain, artistic, choices, were, solely, intended, to, reflect, the, qur, an, s, description, of, paradise, since, there, are, not, extensive, historical, records, to, reference, to, however, many, elements, of, islamic, art, and, architecture, can, certainly, be, interpreted, as, being, intended, to, reflect, paradise, as, described, in, the, qur, an, and, there, are, particular, historical, records, which, support, a, number, of, case, studies, in, this, claim, historical, evidence, does, support, the, claim, that, certain, islamic, garden, structures, and, mosaics, particularly, those, of, spanish, persian, and, indian, origins, were, intended, to, mirror, a, scene, of, paradise, as, described, in, the, qur, an, the, alhambra, court, of, the, lions, grenada, spain, the, structural, layout, of, the, gardens, of, the, alhambra, in, grenada, embodies, the, idea, of, water, as, a, symbol, of, representing, paradise, within, islamic, gardens, in, particular, the, courtyard, of, the, lions, which, follows, the, quarter, garden, or, the, chahar, bagh, layout, typical, to, islamic, gardens, features, a, serene, water, fountain, at, its, centre, the, fountain, is, carved, with, stone, lions, with, the, water, emerging, from, the, mouths, of, these, lions, the, static, nature, of, the, locally, sourced, water, features, within, the, courtyard, of, the, lions, at, the, alhambra, adds, to, the, atmosphere, of, serenity, and, stillness, which, is, typical, of, islamic, gardens, that, utilise, water, features, resembling, the, image, of, paradise, as, found, in, the, qur, an, there, is, not, yet, concrete, evidence, that, islamic, gardens, were, solely, intended, to, represent, images, of, paradise, however, it, can, be, deduced, from, certain, inscriptions, and, intentions, of, structures, that, creating, an, atmosphere, of, divinity, and, serenity, were, part, of, the, artists, intentions, tombs, became, the, metaphorical, paradise, on, earth, for, islamic, architecture, and, gardens, they, were, a, place, of, eternal, peace, were, devout, followers, of, god, could, rest, the, taj, mahal, upon, the, exterior, of, the, tomb, mausoleum, of, the, taj, mahal, inscriptions, of, passages, from, the, qur, an, adorn, the, exterior, facades, encasing, the, iwans, these, inscriptions, rehearse, passages, of, an, eschatological, nature, referencing, the, day, of, judgement, and, themes, of, paradise, similarly, the, placement, of, the, tomb, structure, within, the, waterscape, garden, environment, heightens, the, conceptual, relationship, between, tomb, gardens, and, a, place, of, paradise, as, discussed, in, the, qur, an, similarly, the, white, marble, used, for, the, construction, of, the, tomb, mausoleum, furthers, the, relationship, between, the, purity, and, divinity, of, the, tomb, elevating, the, status, of, the, tomb, to, that, of, paradise, preserved, historical, writings, from, an, interview, with, the, artisan, of, the, prophet, s, mosque, at, medina, between, 705, and, 715, revealed, how, the, mosaic, depictions, of, gardens, within, this, mosque, were, in, fact, created, according, to, the, picture, of, the, tree, of, paradise, and, its, palaces, structures, that, are, similarly, adorned, with, naturalistic, mosaics, and, were, created, during, the, same, period, as, the, prophet, s, mosque, at, medina, can, be, said, to, have, had, the, same, intended, effect, the, mosaic, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, jerusalem, constructed, between, 690, and, 692, the, dome, of, the, rock, at, jerusalem, features, a, large, scale, mosaic, on, the, interior, of, the, domed, structure, it, is, likely, that, this, richly, embellished, and, detailed, mosaic, was, intended, to, replicate, an, image, of, paradise, featuring, fruit, bearing, trees, vegetal, motifs, and, flowing, rivers, accompanied, by, a, calligraphic, frieze, the, mosaic, depicts, symmetrical, and, vegetal, vine, scrolls, surrounded, by, trees, of, blue, green, and, turquoise, mosaics, jewel, like, embellishments, as, well, as, gold, pigment, complete, the, mosaic, not, only, did, mosaics, of, this, kind, seek, to, reflect, paradise, as, described, in, the, qur, an, but, they, were, also, thought, to, represent, and, proclaim, muslim, victories, the, mosaic, of, the, great, mosque, of, damascus, syria, in, a, similar, instance, the, mosaic, within, the, great, mosque, of, damascus, constructed, within, a, similar, timeframe, to, the, dome, of, the, rock, features, the, most, noticeable, elements, of, a, paradisiacal, garden, as, described, in, the, qur, an, therefore, it, would, not, be, unreasonable, to, suggest, that, the, mosaic, on, the, exterior, facade, of, the, great, mosque, of, damascus, was, similarly, intended, to, replicate, an, image, of, paradise, in, the, viewer, s, mind, on, the, origin, of, the, world, a, text, from, the, nag, hammadi, library, held, in, ancient, gnosticism, describes, paradise, as, being, located, outside, the, circuit, of, the, sun, and, moon, in, the, luxuriant, earth, east, in, the, midst, of, stones, the, tree, of, life, which, will, provide, for, the, souls, of, saints, after, they, come, out, of, their, corrupted, bodies, is, located, in, the, north, of, paradise, besides, the, tree, of, knowledge, that, contains, the, power, of, god
