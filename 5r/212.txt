the, reign, of, zara, yaqob, a, religious, discussion, between, giyorgis, and, a, french, visitor, led, to, the, dispatch, of, an, embassy, from, ethiopia, to, the, vatican, the, period, of, jesuit, influence, which, broke, the, connection, with, egypt, began, a, new, chapter, in, church, history, the, initiative, in, roman, catholic, missions, to, ethiopia, was, taken, not, by, rome, but, by, portugal, in, the, course, of, a, conflict, with, the, muslim, ottoman, empire, and, the, sultanate, of, adal, for, the, command, of, the, trade, route, to, india, via, the, red, sea, in, 1507,

did, the, emperor, make, formal, submission, to, the, pope, susenyos, made, roman, catholicism, the, official, state, religion, but, was, met, with, heavy, resistance, by, his, subjects, and, by, the, authorities, of, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, and, eventually, had, to, abdicate, in, 1632, in, favour, of, his, son, fasilides, who, promptly, restored, ethiopian, orthodox, christianity, as, the, state, religion, he, then, in, 1633, expelled, the, jesuits, and, in, 1665, fasilides, ordered, that, all, jesuit, books, the, books, of, the, franks, be, burned, david, daniels, has, suggested, that, the, ethiopian, church, has, had, a, stronger, impact, on, the, reformation, than, most, scholars, acknowledge, for, martin, luther, who, spearheaded, the, reformation, daniels, says, the, ethiopian, church, conferred, legitimacy, on, luther, s, emerging, protestant, vision, of, a, church, outside, the, authority, of, the, roman, catholic, papacy, as, it, was, an, ancient, church, with, direct, ties, to, the, apostles, according, to, daniels, martin, luther, saw, that, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, practiced, elements, of, faith, including, communion, under, both, kinds, vernacular, scriptures, and, married, clergy, and, these, practices, became, customary, in, the, lutheran, churches, the, ethiopian, church, also, rejected, papal, supremacy, purgatory, and, indulgences, which, the, lutherans, disagreed, with, and, thus, for, luther, the, ethiopian, church, was, the, true, forerunner, of, protestantism, luther, believed, that, the, ethiopian, church, kept, true, apostolic, practices, which, the, lutherans, would, adopt, through, reading, the, scriptures, in, 1534, a, cleric, of, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, michael, the, deacon, met, with, martin, luther, and, affirmed, the, augsburg, confession, saying, this, is, a, good, creed, that, is, faith, in, addition, martin, luther, stated, that, the, lutheran, mass, agreed, with, that, used, by, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, as, a, result, luther, invited, the, ethiopian, church, and, michael, to, full, fellowship, in, more, modern, times, the, ethiopian, church, has, experienced, a, series, of, developments, the, 19th, century, witnessed, the, publication, of, an, amharic, translation, of, the, bible, largely, the, work, of, abu, rumi, over, ten, years, in, cairo, this, version, with, some, changes, held, sway, until, emperor, haile, selassie, ordered, a, new, translation, which, appeared, in, 1960, 1, haile, selassie, also, played, a, prominent, role, in, further, reforms, of, the, church, which, included, encouraging, the, distribution, of, abu, rumi, s, translation, throughout, ethiopia, as, well, as, his, promotion, of, improved, education, of, clergy, a, significant, step, in, the, emperor, s, effort, being, the, founding, of, the, theological, college, of, the, holy, trinity, church, in, december, 1944, a, third, development, came, after, haile, selassie, s, restoration, to, ethiopia, when, he, issued, on, 30, november, decree, number, 2, of, 1942, a, new, law, reforming, the, church, the, primary, objectives, of, this, decree, were, to, put, the, finances, of, the, church, in, order, to, create, a, central, fund, for, its, activities, and, to, set, forth, requirements, for, the, appointment, of, clergy, which, had, been, fairly, lax, until, then, the, coptic, and, ethiopian, churches, reached, an, agreement, on, 13, july, 1948, that, led, to, autocephaly, for, the, ethiopian, church, five, bishops, were, immediately, consecrated, by, the, coptic, pope, of, alexandria, and, patriarch, of, all, africa, empowered, to, elect, a, new, patriarch, for, their, church, and, the, successor, to, qerellos, iv, would, have, the, power, to, consecrate, new, bishops, this, promotion, was, completed, when, coptic, orthodox, pope, joseph, ii, consecrated, an, ethiopian, born, archbishop, abuna, basilios, 14, january, 1951, then, in, 1959, pope, cyril, vi, of, alexandria, crowned, basilios, as, the, first, patriarch, of, ethiopia, basilios, died, in, 1970, and, was, succeeded, that, year, by, tewophilos, with, the, fall, of, emperor, haile, selassie, in, 1974, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, was, disestablished, as, the, state, church, the, new, marxist, government, began, nationalizing, property, including, land, owned, by, the, church, tewophilos, was, arrested, in, 1976, by, the, marxist, derg, military, junta, and, secretly, executed, in, 1979, the, government, ordered, the, church, to, elect, a, new, patriarch, and, takla, haymanot, was, enthroned, the, coptic, orthodox, church, refused, to, recognize, the, election, and, enthronement, of, tekle, haymanot, on, the, grounds, that, the, synod, of, the, ethiopian, church, had, not, removed, tewophilos, and, that, the, government, had, not, publicly, acknowledged, his, death, and, he, was, thus, still, the, legitimate, patriarch, of, ethiopia, formal, relations, between, the, two, churches, were, halted, although, they, remained, in, communion, with, each, other, formal, relations, between, the, two, churches, resumed, on, july, 13, 2007, tekle, haymanot, proved, to, be, much, less, accommodating, to, the, derg, regime, than, it, had, expected, and, so, when, the, patriarch, died, in, 1988, a, new, patriarch, with, closer, ties, to, the, regime, was, sought, the, archbishop, of, gondar, a, member, of, the, derg, era, ethiopian, parliament, was, elected, and, enthroned, as, abuna, merkorios, following, the, fall, of, the, derg, regime, in, 1991, and, the, coming, to, power, of, the, eprdf, government, merkorios, abdicated, under, public, pressure, the, church, then, elected, a, new, patriarch, paulos, who, was, recognized, by, the, coptic, orthodox, pope, of, alexandria, the, former, merkorios, then, fled, abroad, and, announced, from, exile, that, his, abdication, had, been, made, under, duress, and, thus, he, was, still, the, legitimate, patriarch, of, ethiopia, several, bishops, also, went, into, exile, and, formed, a, break, away, alternate, synod, the, eritrean, orthodox, tewahedo, church, was, granted,
