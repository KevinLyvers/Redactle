https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil
in, philosophy, religion, and, psychology, good, and, evil, is, a, common, dichotomy, in, religions, with, manichaean, and, abrahamic, influence, evil, is, perceived, as, the, dualistic, antagonistic, opposite, of, good, in, which, good, should, prevail, and, evil, should, be, defeated, taoist, philosophies, typically, perceive, the, world, through, a, dualistic, cosmological, lens, where, this, dichotomy, is, a, central, concept, and, often, symbolized, by, the, taijitu, commonly, known, as, the, yin, yang, evil, is, often, used, to, denote, profound, immorality, evil, has, also, been, described, as, a, supernatural, force, definitions, of, evil, vary, as, does, the, analysis, of, its, motives, however, elements, that, are, commonly, associated, with, evil, involve, unbalanced, behavior, involving, expediency, selfishness, ignorance, or, negligence, the, principal, study, of, good, and, evil, or, morality, is, ethics, of, which, there, are, three, major, branches, normative, ethics, concerning, how, we, ought, to, behave, applied, ethics, concerning, particular, moral, issues, and, metaethics, concerning, the, nature, of, morality, itself, every, language, has, a, word, expressing, good, in, the, sense, of, having, the, right, or, desirable, quality, and, bad, in, the, sense, undesirable, a, sense, of, moral, judgment, and, a, distinction, right, and, wrong, good, and, bad, are, cultural, universals, the, philosopher, zoroaster, simplified, the, pantheon, of, early, iranian, gods, into, two, opposing, forces, ahura, mazda, illuminating, wisdom, and, angra, mainyu, destructive, spirit, which, were, in, conflict, this, idea, developed, into, a, religion, which, spawned, many, sects, some, of, which, embraced, an, extreme, dualistic, belief, that, the, material, world, should, be, shunned, and, the, spiritual, world, should, be, embraced, gnostic, ideas, influenced, many, ancient, religions, which, teach, that, gnosis, variously, interpreted, as, enlightenment, salvation, emancipation, or, oneness, with, god, may, be, reached, by, practising, philanthropy, to, the, point, of, personal, poverty, sexual, abstinence, as, far, as, possible, for, hearers, total, for, initiates, and, diligently, searching, for, wisdom, by, helping, others, similarly, in, ancient, egypt, there, were, the, concepts, of, ma, at, the, principle, of, justice, order, and, cohesion, and, isfet, the, principle, of, chaos, disorder, and, decay, with, the, former, being, the, power, and, principles, which, society, sought, to, embody, where, the, latter, was, such, that, undermined, society, this, correspondence, can, also, be, seen, reflected, in, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, as, well, in, the, conflict, between, marduk, and, tiamat, in, western, civilisation, the, basic, meanings, of, and, are, bad, cowardly, and, good, brave, capable, and, their, absolute, sense, emerges, only, around, 400, bc, with, pre, socratic, philosophy, in, particular, democritus, morality, in, this, absolute, sense, solidifies, in, the, dialogues, of, plato, together, with, the, emergence, of, monotheistic, thought, notably, in, euthyphro, which, ponders, the, concept, of, piety, as, a, moral, absolute, the, idea, was, further, developed, in, late, antiquity, by, neoplatonists, gnostics, and, church, fathers, this, development, from, the, relative, or, habitual, to, the, absolute, is, also, evident, in, the, terms, ethics, and, morality, both, being, derived, from, terms, for, regional, custom, greek, and, latin, mores, respectively, see, also, si, r, according, to, the, classical, definition, of, augustine, of, hippo, sin, is, a, word, deed, or, desire, in, opposition, to, the, eternal, law, of, god, many, medieval, christian, theologians, both, broadened, and, narrowed, the, basic, concept, of, good, and, evil, until, it, came, to, have, several, sometimes, complex, definitions, such, as, today, the, basic, dichotomy, often, breaks, down, along, these, lines, the, modern, english, word, evil, old, english, yfel, and, its, cognates, such, as, the, german, bel, and, dutch, euvel, are, widely, considered, to, come, from, a, proto, germanic, reconstructed, form, of, ubilaz, comparable, to, the, hittite, huwapp, ultimately, from, the, proto, indo, european, form, wap, and, suffixed, zero, grade, form, up, elo, other, later, germanic, forms, include, middle, english, evel, ifel, ufel, old, frisian, evel, adjective, and, noun, old, saxon, ubil, old, high, german, ubil, and, gothic, ubils, the, nature, of, being, good, has, been, given, many, treatments, one, is, that, the, good, is, based, on, the, natural, love, bonding, and, affection, that, begins, at, the, earliest, stages, of, personal, development, another, is, that, goodness, is, a, product, of, knowing, truth, differing, views, also, exist, as, to, why, evil, might, arise, many, religious, and, philosophical, traditions, claim, that, evil, behavior, is, an, aberration, that, results, from, the, imperfect, human, condition, e, g, the, fall, of, man, sometimes, evil, is, attributed, to, the, existence, of, free, will, and, human, agency, some, argue, that, evil, itself, is, ultimately, based, in, an, ignorance, of, truth, i, e, human, value, sanctity, divinity, a, variety, of, thinkers, have, alleged, the, opposite, by, suggesting, that, evil, is, learned, as, a, consequence, of, tyrannical, social, structures, in, confucianism, and, taoism, there, is, no, direct, analogue, to, the, way, good, and, evil, are, opposed, although, references, to, demonic, influence, is, common, in, chinese, folk, religion, confucianism, s, primary, concern, is, with, correct, social, relationships, and, the, behavior, appropriate, to, the, learned, or, superior, man, evil, would, thus, correspond, to, wrong, behavior, still, less, does, it, map, into, taoism, in, spite, of, the, centrality, of, dualism, in, that, system, but, the, opposite, of, the, basic, virtues, of, taoism, compassion, moderation, and, humility, can, be, inferred, to, be, the, analogue, of, evil, in, it, pyrrhonism, holds, that, good, and, evil, do, not, exist, by, nature, meaning, that, good, and, evil, do, not, exist, within, the, things, themselves, all, judgments, of, good, and, evil, are, relative, to, the, one, doing, the, judging, benedict, de, spinoza, states, 1, by, good, i, understand, that, which, we, certainly, know, is, useful, to, us, 2, by, evil, on, the, contrary, i, understand, that, which, we, certainly, know, hinders, us, from, possessing, anything, that, is, good, spinoza, assumes, a, quasi, mathematical, style, and, states, these, further, propositions, which, he, purports, to, prove, or, demonstrate, from, the, above, definitions, in, part, iv, of, his, ethics, friedrich, nietzsche, in, a, rejection, of, judeo, christian, morality, addresses, this, in, two, books, beyond, good, and, evil, and, on, the, genealogy, of, morals, in, these, works, he, states, that, the, natural, functional, non, good, has, been, socially, transformed, into, the, religious, concept, of, evil, by, the, slave, mentality, of, the, masses, who, resent, their, masters, the, strong, he, also, critiques, morality, by, saying, that, many, who, consider, themselves, to, be, moral, are, simply, acting, out, of, cowardice, wanting, to, do, evil, but, afraid, of, the, repercussions, carl, jung, in, his, book, answer, to, job, and, elsewhere, depicted, evil, as, the, dark, side, of, the, devil, people, tend, to, believe, evil, is, something, external, to, them, because, they, project, their, shadow, onto, others, jung, interpreted, the, story, of, jesus, as, an, account, of, god, facing, his, own, shadow, in, 2007, philip, zimbardo, suggested, that, people, may, act, in, evil, ways, as, a, result, of, a, collective, identity, this, hypothesis, based, on, his, previous, experience, from, the, stanford, prison, experiment, was, published, in, the, book, the, lucifer, effect, understanding, how, good, people, turn, evil, the, bah, faith, asserts, that, evil, is, non, existent, and, that, it, is, a, concept, for, the, lacking, of, good, just, as, cold, is, the, state, of, no, heat, darkness, is, the, state, of, no, light, forgetfulness, the, lacking, of, memory, ignorance, the, lacking, of, knowledge, all, of, these, are, states, of, lacking, and, have, no, real, existence, thus, evil, does, not, exist, and, is, relative, to, man, abdu, l, bah, son, of, the, founder, of, the, religion, in, some, answered, questions, states, nevertheless, a, doubt, occurs, to, the, mind, that, is, scorpions, and, serpents, are, poisonous, are, they, good, or, evil, for, they, are, existing, beings, yes, a, scorpion, is, evil, in, relation, to, man, a, serpent, is, evil, in, relation, to, man, but, in, relation, to, themselves, they, are, not, evil, for, their, poison, is, their, weapon, and, by, their, sting, they, defend, themselves, thus, evil, is, more, of, an, intellectual, concept, than, a, true, reality, since, god, is, good, and, upon, creating, creation, he, confirmed, it, by, saying, it, is, good, genesis, 1, 31, evil, cannot, have, a, true, reality, christian, theology, draws, its, concept, of, evil, from, the, old, and, new, testaments, the, christian, bible, exercises, the, dominant, influence, upon, ideas, about, god, and, evil, in, the, western, world, in, the, old, testament, evil, is, understood, to, be, an, opposition, to, god, as, well, as, something, unsuitable, or, inferior, such, as, the, leader, of, the, fallen, angels, satan, in, the, new, testament, the, greek, word, poneros, is, used, to, indicate, unsuitability, while, kakos, is, used, to, refer, to, opposition, to, god, in, the, human, realm, officially, the, catholic, church, extracts, its, understanding, of, evil, from, its, canonical, antiquity, and, the, dominican, theologian, thomas, aquinas, who, in, summa, theologica, defines, evil, as, the, absence, or, privation, of, good, french, american, theologian, henri, blocher, describes, evil, when, viewed, as, a, theological, concept, as, an, unjustifiable, reality, in, common, parlance, evil, is, something, that, occurs, in, experience, that, ought, not, to, be, according, to, 1, timothy, 6, 10, for, the, love, of, money, is, the, root, of, all, of, evil, in, mormonism, mortal, life, is, viewed, as, a, test, of, faith, where, one, s, choices, are, central, to, the, plan, of, salvation, see, agency, lds, church, evil, is, that, which, keeps, one, from, discovering, the, nature, of, god, it, is, believed, that, one, must, choose, not, to, be, evil, to, return, to, god, christian, science, believes, that, evil, arises, from, a, misunderstanding, of, the, goodness, of, nature, which, is, understood, as, being, inherently, perfect, if, viewed, from, the, correct, spiritual, perspective, misunderstanding, god, s, reality, leads, to, incorrect, choices, which, are, termed, evil, this, has, led, to, the, rejection, of, any, separate, power, being, the, source, of, evil, or, of, god, as, being, the, source, of, evil, instead, the, appearance, of, evil, is, the, result, of, a, mistaken, concept, of, good, christian, scientists, argue, that, even, the, most, evil, person, does, not, pursue, evil, for, its, own, sake, but, from, the, mistaken, viewpoint, that, he, or, she, will, achieve, some, kind, of, good, thereby, there, is, no, concept, of, absolute, evil, in, islam, as, a, fundamental, universal, principle, that, is, independent, from, and, equal, with, good, in, a, dualistic, sense, within, islam, it, is, considered, essential, to, believe, that, all, comes, from, god, whether, it, is, perceived, as, good, or, bad, by, individuals, and, things, that, are, perceived, as, evil, or, bad, are, either, natural, events, natural, disasters, or, illnesses, or, caused, by, humanity, s, free, will, to, disobey, god, s, orders, according, to, the, ahmadiyya, understanding, of, islam, evil, does, not, have, a, positive, existence, in, itself, and, is, merely, the, lack, of, good, just, as, darkness, is, the, result, of, lack, of, light, in, judaism, yetzer, hara, is, the, congenital, inclination, to, do, evil, by, violating, the, will, of, god, the, term, is, drawn, from, the, phrase, the, imagination, of, the, heart, of, man, evil, yetzer, lev, ha, adam, ra, which, occurs, twice, at, the, beginning, of, the, torah, genesis, 6, 5, and, 8, 21, the, hebrew, word, yetzer, having, appeared, twice, in, genesis, occurs, again, at, the, end, of, the, torah, i, knew, their, devisings, that, they, do, thus, from, beginning, to, end, the, heart, s, yetzer, is, continually, bent, on, evil, a, profoundly, pessimistic, view, of, the, human, being, however, the, torah, which, began, with, blessing, anticipates, future, blessing, which, will, come, as, a, result, of, god, circumcising, the, heart, in, the, latter, days, in, traditional, judaism, the, yetzer, hara, is, not, a, demonic, force, but, rather, man, s, misuse, of, things, the, physical, body, needs, to, survive, thus, the, need, for, food, becomes, gluttony, due, to, the, yetzer, hara, the, need, for, procreation, becomes, promiscuity, and, so, on, the, yetzer, hara, could, thus, be, best, described, as, one, s, baser, instincts, according, to, the, talmudic, tractate, avot, de, rabbi, natan, a, boy, s, evil, inclination, is, greater, than, his, good, inclination, until, he, turns, 13, bar, mitzvah, at, which, point, the, good, inclination, is, born, and, able, to, control, his, behavior, moreover, the, rabbis, have, stated, the, greater, the, man, the, greater, his, inclination, buddhist, ethics, are, traditionally, based, on, what, buddhists, view, as, the, enlightened, perspective, of, the, buddha, or, other, enlightened, beings, such, as, bodhisattvas, the, indian, term, for, ethics, or, morality, used, in, buddhism, is, la, or, s, la, p, li, la, in, buddhism, is, one, of, three, sections, of, the, noble, eightfold, path, and, is, a, code, of, conduct, that, embraces, a, commitment, to, harmony, and, self, restraint, with, the, principal, motivation, being, nonviolence, or, freedom, from, causing, harm, it, has, been, variously, described, as, virtue, moral, discipline, and, precept, s, la, is, an, internal, aware, and, intentional, ethical, behavior, according, to, one, s, commitment, to, the, path, of, liberation, it, is, an, ethical, compass, within, self, and, relationships, rather, than, what, is, associated, with, the, english, word, morality, i, e, obedience, a, sense, of, obligation, and, external, constraint, s, la, is, one, of, the, three, practices, foundational, to, buddhism, and, the, non, sectarian, vipassana, movement, s, la, sam, dhi, and, pa, as, well, as, the, theravadin, foundations, of, s, la, d, na, and, bhavana, it, is, also, the, second, p, ramit, s, la, is, also, wholehearted, commitment, to, what, is, wholesome, two, aspects, of, s, la, are, essential, to, the, training, right, performance, caritta, and, right, avoidance, varitta, honoring, the, precepts, of, s, la, is, considered, a, great, gift, mahadana, to, others, because, it, creates, an, atmosphere, of, trust, respect, and, security, it, means, the, practitioner, poses, no, threat, to, another, person, s, life, property, family, rights, or, well, being, moral, instructions, are, included, in, buddhist, scriptures, or, handed, down, through, tradition, most, scholars, of, buddhist, ethics, thus, rely, on, the, examination, of, buddhist, scriptures, and, the, use, of, anthropological, evidence, from, traditional, buddhist, societies, to, justify, claims, about, the, nature, of, buddhist, ethics, in, hinduism, the, concept, of, dharma, or, righteousness, clearly, divides, the, world, into, good, and, evil, and, clearly, explains, that, wars, have, to, be, waged, sometimes, to, establish, and, protect, dharma, this, war, is, called, dharmayuddha, this, division, of, good, and, evil, is, of, major, importance, in, both, the, hindu, epics, of, ramayana, and, mahabharata, however, the, main, emphasis, in, hinduism, is, on, bad, action, rather, than, bad, people, the, hindu, holy, text, the, bhagavad, gita, speaks, of, the, balance, of, good, and, evil, when, this, balance, goes, off, divine, incarnations, come, to, help, to, restore, this, balance, as, a, balance, must, be, maintained, for, peace, and, harmony, in, the, world, in, adherence, to, the, core, principle, of, spiritual, evolution, the, sikh, idea, of, evil, changes, depending, on, one, s, position, on, the, path, to, liberation, at, the, beginning, stages, of, spiritual, growth, good, and, evil, may, seem, neatly, separated, however, once, one, s, spirit, evolves, to, the, point, where, it, sees, most, clearly, the, idea, of, evil, vanishes, and, the, truth, is, revealed, in, his, writings, guru, arjan, explains, that, because, god, is, the, source, of, all, things, what, we, believe, to, be, evil, must, too, come, from, god, and, because, god, is, ultimately, a, source, of, absolute, good, nothing, truly, evil, can, originate, from, god, nevertheless, sikhism, like, many, other, religions, does, incorporate, a, list, of, vices, from, which, suffering, corruption, and, abject, negativity, arise, these, are, known, as, the, five, thieves, called, such, due, to, their, propensity, to, cloud, the, mind, and, lead, one, astray, from, the, prosecution, of, righteous, action, these, are, one, who, gives, in, to, the, temptations, of, the, five, thieves, is, known, as, manmukh, or, someone, who, lives, selfishly, and, without, virtue, inversely, the, gurmukh, who, thrive, in, their, reverence, toward, divine, knowledge, rise, above, vice, via, the, practice, of, the, high, virtues, of, sikhism, these, are, in, the, originally, persian, religion, of, zoroastrianism, the, world, is, a, battle, ground, between, the, god, ahura, mazda, also, called, ormazd, and, the, malignant, spirit, angra, mainyu, also, called, ahriman, the, final, resolution, of, the, struggle, between, good, and, evil, was, supposed, to, occur, on, a, d, ay, of, judgement, in, which, all, beings, that, have, lived, will, be, led, across, a, bridge, of, fire, and, those, who, are, evil, will, be, cast, down, forever, in, afghan, belief, angels, yazata, and, saints, are, beings, sent, to, help, us, achieve, the, path, towards, goodness, it, is, possible, to, treat, the, essential, theories, of, value, by, the, use, of, a, philosophical, and, academic, approach, in, properly, analyzing, theories, of, value, everyday, beliefs, are, not, only, carefully, catalogued, and, described, but, also, rigorously, analyzed, and, judged, there, are, at, least, two, basic, ways, of, presenting, a, theory, of, value, based, on, two, different, kinds, of, questions, the, two, questions, are, subtly, different, one, may, answer, the, first, question, by, researching, the, world, by, use, of, social, science, and, examining, the, preferences, that, people, assert, however, one, may, answer, the, second, question, by, use, of, reasoning, introspection, prescription, and, generalization, the, former, kind, of, method, of, analysis, is, called, descriptive, because, it, attempts, to, describe, what, people, actually, view, as, good, or, evil, while, the, latter, is, called, normative, because, it, tries, to, actively, prohibit, evils, and, cherish, goods, these, descriptive, and, normative, approaches, can, be, complementary, for, example, tracking, the, decline, of, the, popularity, of, slavery, across, cultures, is, the, work, of, descriptive, ethics, while, advising, that, slavery, be, avoided, is, normative, meta, ethics, is, the, study, of, the, fundamental, questions, concerning, the, nature, and, origins, of, the, good, and, the, evil, including, inquiry, into, the, nature, of, good, and, evil, as, well, as, the, meaning, of, evaluative, language, in, this, respect, meta, ethics, is, not, necessarily, tied, to, investigations, into, how, others, see, the, good, or, of, asserting, what, is, good, a, satisfying, formulation, of, goodness, is, valuable, because, it, might, allow, one, to, construct, a, good, life, or, society, by, reliable, processes, of, deduction, elaboration, or, prioritization, one, could, answer, the, ancient, question, how, should, we, then, live, among, many, other, important, related, questions, it, has, long, been, thought, that, this, question, can, best, be, answered, by, examining, what, it, is, that, necessarily, makes, a, thing, valuable, or, in, what, the, source, of, value, consists, one, attempt, to, define, goodness, describes, it, as, a, property, of, the, world, with, platonic, idealism, according, to, this, claim, to, talk, about, the, good, is, to, talk, about, something, real, that, exists, in, the, object, itself, independent, of, the, perception, of, it, plato, advocated, this, view, in, his, expression, that, there, is, such, a, thing, as, an, eternal, realm, of, forms, or, ideas, and, that, the, greatest, of, the, ideas, and, the, essence, of, being, was, goodness, or, the, good, the, good, was, defined, by, many, ancient, greeks, and, other, ancient, philosophers, as, a, perfect, and, eternal, idea, or, blueprint, the, good, is, the, right, relation, between, all, that, exists, and, this, exists, in, the, mind, of, the, divine, or, some, heavenly, realm, the, good, is, the, harmony, of, a, just, political, community, love, friendship, the, ordered, human, soul, of, virtues, and, the, right, relation, to, the, divine, and, to, nature, the, characters, in, plato, s, dialogues, mention, the, many, virtues, of, a, philosopher, or, a, lover, of, wisdom, a, theist, is, a, person, who, believes, that, the, supreme, being, exists, or, gods, exist, monotheism, or, polytheism, a, theist, may, therefore, claim, that, the, universe, has, a, purpose, and, value, according, to, the, will, of, such, creator, s, that, lies, partially, beyond, human, understanding, for, instance, thomas, aquinas, a, proponent, of, this, view, believed, he, had, proven, the, existence, of, god, and, the, right, relations, that, humans, ought, to, have, to, the, divine, first, cause, monotheists, might, also, hope, for, infinite, universal, love, such, hope, is, often, translated, as, faith, and, wisdom, itself, is, largely, defined, within, some, religious, doctrines, as, a, knowledge, and, understanding, of, innate, goodness, the, concepts, of, innocence, spiritual, purity, and, salvation, are, likewise, related, to, a, concept, of, being, in, or, returning, to, a, state, of, goodness, one, that, according, to, various, teachings, of, enlightenment, approaches, a, state, of, holiness, or, godliness, aristotle, believed, that, virtues, consisted, of, realization, of, potentials, unique, to, humanity, such, as, the, use, of, reason, this, type, of, view, called, perfectionism, has, been, recently, defended, in, modern, form, by, thomas, hurka, an, entirely, different, form, of, perfectionism, has, arisen, in, response, to, rapid, technological, change, some, techno, optimists, especially, transhumanists, avow, a, form, of, perfectionism, in, which, the, capacity, to, determine, good, and, trade, off, fundamental, values, is, expressed, not, by, humans, but, by, software, genetic, engineering, of, humans, artificial, intelligence, skeptics, assert, that, rather, than, perfect, goodness, it, would, be, only, the, appearance, of, perfect, goodness, reinforced, by, persuasion, technology, and, probably, brute, force, of, violent, technological, escalation, which, would, cause, people, to, accept, such, rulers, or, rules, authored, by, them, welfarist, theories, of, value, say, things, that, are, good, are, such, because, of, their, positive, effects, on, human, well, being, it, is, difficult, to, figure, out, where, an, immaterial, trait, such, as, goodness, could, reside, in, the, world, a, counterproposal, is, to, locate, values, inside, people, some, philosophers, go, so, far, as, to, say, that, if, some, state, of, affairs, does, not, tend, to, arouse, a, desirable, subjective, state, in, self, aware, beings, then, it, cannot, be, good, most, philosophers, who, think, goods, have, to, create, desirable, mental, states, also, say, that, goods, are, experiences, of, self, aware, beings, these, philosophers, often, distinguish, the, experience, which, they, call, an, intrinsic, good, from, the, things, that, seem, to, cause, the, experience, which, they, call, inherent, goods, some, theories, describe, no, higher, collective, value, than, that, of, maximizing, pleasure, for, individual, s, some, even, define, goodness, and, intrinsic, value, as, the, experience, of, pleasure, and, bad, as, the, experience, of, pain, this, view, is, called, hedonism, a, monistic, theory, of, value, it, has, two, main, varieties, simple, and, epicurean, simple, hedonism, is, the, view, that, physical, pleasure, is, the, ultimate, good, however, the, ancient, philosopher, epicurus, used, the, word, pleasure, in, a, more, general, sense, that, encompassed, a, range, of, states, from, bliss, to, contentment, to, relief, contrary, to, popular, caricature, he, valued, pleasures, of, the, mind, to, bodily, pleasures, and, advocated, moderation, as, the, surest, path, to, happiness, jeremy, bentham, s, book, the, principles, of, morals, and, legislation, prioritized, goods, by, considering, pleasure, pain, and, consequences, this, theory, had, a, wide, effect, on, public, affairs, up, to, and, including, the, present, day, a, similar, system, was, later, named, utilitarianism, by, john, stuart, mill, more, broadly, utilitarian, theories, are, examples, of, consequentialism, all, utilitarian, theories, are, based, upon, the, maxim, of, utility, which, states, that, good, is, whatever, provides, the, greatest, happiness, for, the, greatest, number, it, follows, from, this, principle, that, what, brings, happiness, to, the, greatest, number, of, people, is, good, a, benefit, of, tracing, good, to, pleasure, and, pain, is, that, both, are, easily, understandable, both, in, oneself, and, to, an, extent, in, others, for, the, hedonist, the, explanation, for, helping, behaviour, may, come, in, the, form, of, empathy, the, ability, of, a, being, to, feel, another, s, pain, people, tend, to, value, the, lives, of, gorillas, more, than, those, of, mosquitoes, because, the, gorilla, lives, and, feels, making, it, easier, to, empathize, with, them, this, idea, is, carried, forward, in, the, ethical, relationship, view, and, has, given, rise, to, the, animal, rights, movement, and, parts, of, the, peace, movement, the, impact, of, sympathy, on, human, behaviour, is, compatible, with, enlightenment, views, including, david, hume, s, stances, that, the, idea, of, a, self, with, unique, identity, is, illusory, and, that, morality, ultimately, comes, down, to, sympathy, and, fellow, feeling, for, others, or, the, exercise, of, approval, underlying, moral, judgments, a, view, adopted, by, james, griffin, attempts, to, find, a, subjective, alternative, to, hedonism, as, an, intrinsic, value, he, argues, that, the, satisfaction, of, one, s, informed, desires, constitutes, well, being, whether, or, not, these, desires, actually, bring, the, agent, happiness, moreover, these, preferences, must, be, life, relevant, that, is, contribute, to, the, success, of, a, person, s, life, overall, desire, satisfaction, may, occur, without, the, agent, s, awareness, of, the, satisfaction, of, the, desire, for, example, if, a, man, wishes, for, his, legal, will, to, be, enacted, after, his, death, and, it, is, then, his, desire, has, been, satisfied, even, though, he, will, never, experience, or, know, of, it, meher, baba, proposed, that, it, is, not, the, satisfaction, of, desires, that, motivates, the, agent, but, rather, a, desire, to, be, free, from, the, limitation, of, all, desires, those, experiences, and, actions, which, increase, the, fetters, of, desire, are, bad, and, those, experiences, and, actions, which, tend, to, emancipate, the, mind, from, limiting, desires, are, good, it, is, through, good, actions, then, that, the, agent, becomes, free, from, selfish, desires, and, achieves, a, state, of, well, being, the, good, is, the, main, link, between, selfishness, thriving, and, dying, selfishness, which, in, the, beginning, is, the, father, of, evil, tendencies, becomes, through, good, deeds, the, hero, of, its, own, defeat, when, the, evil, tendencies, are, completely, replaced, by, good, tendencies, selfishness, is, transformed, into, selflessness, i, e, individual, selfishness, loses, itself, in, universal, interest, the, idea, that, the, ultimate, good, exists, and, is, not, orderable, but, is, globally, measurable, is, reflected, in, various, ways, in, economic, classical, economics, green, economics, welfare, economics, gross, national, happiness, and, scientific, positive, psychology, the, science, of, morality, well, being, measuring, theories, all, of, which, focus, on, various, ways, of, assessing, progress, towards, that, goal, a, so, called, genuine, progress, indicator, modern, economics, thus, reflects, very, ancient, philosophy, but, a, calculation, or, quantitative, or, other, process, based, on, cardinality, and, statistics, replaces, the, simple, ordering, of, values, for, example, in, both, economics, and, in, folk, wisdom, the, value, of, something, seems, to, rise, so, long, as, it, is, relatively, scarce, however, if, it, becomes, too, scarce, it, leads, often, to, a, conflict, and, can, reduce, collective, value, in, the, classical, political, economy, of, adam, smith, and, david, ricardo, and, in, its, critique, by, karl, marx, human, labour, is, seen, as, the, ultimate, source, of, all, new, economic, value, this, is, an, objective, theory, of, value, which, attributes, value, to, real, production, costs, and, ultimately, expenditures, of, human, labour, time, see, law, of, value, it, contrasts, with, marginal, utility, theory, which, argues, that, the, value, of, labour, depends, on, subjective, preferences, by, consumers, which, may, however, also, be, objectively, studied, the, economic, value, of, labour, may, be, assessed, technically, in, terms, of, its, use, value, or, utility, or, commercially, in, terms, of, its, exchange, value, price, or, production, cost, see, labour, power, but, its, value, may, also, be, socially, assessed, in, terms, of, its, contribution, to, the, wealth, and, well, being, of, a, society, in, non, market, societies, labour, may, be, valued, primarily, in, terms, of, skill, time, and, output, as, well, as, moral, or, social, criteria, and, legal, obligations, in, market, societies, labour, is, valued, economically, primarily, through, the, labour, market, the, price, of, labour, may, then, be, set, by, supply, and, demand, by, strike, action, or, legislation, or, by, legal, or, professional, entry, requirements, into, occupations, conceptual, metaphor, theories, argue, against, both, subjective, and, objective, conceptions, of, value, and, meaning, and, focus, on, the, relationships, between, body, and, other, essential, elements, of, human, life, in, effect, conceptual, metaphor, theories, treat, ethics, as, an, ontology, problem, and, the, issue, of, how, to, work, out, values, as, a, negotiation, of, these, metaphors, not, the, application, of, some, abstraction, or, a, strict, standoff, between, parties, who, have, no, way, to, understand, each, other, s, views, a, fundamental, question, is, whether, there, is, a, universal, transcendent, definition, of, evil, or, whether, evil, is, determined, by, one, s, social, or, cultural, background, c, s, lewis, in, the, abolition, of, man, maintained, that, there, are, certain, acts, that, are, universally, considered, evil, such, as, rape, and, murder, however, the, numerous, instances, in, which, rape, or, murder, is, morally, affected, by, social, context, call, this, into, question, up, until, the, mid, 19th, century, many, countries, practiced, forms, of, slavery, as, is, often, the, case, those, transgressing, moral, boundaries, stood, to, profit, from, that, exercise, arguably, slavery, has, always, been, the, same, and, objectively, evil, but, individuals, with, a, motivation, to, transgress, will, justify, that, action, the, nazis, during, world, war, ii, considered, genocide, to, be, acceptable, as, did, the, hutu, interahamwe, in, the, rwandan, genocide, one, might, point, out, though, that, the, actual, perpetrators, of, those, atrocities, probably, avoided, calling, their, actions, genocide, since, the, objective, meaning, of, any, act, accurately, described, by, that, word, is, to, wrongfully, kill, a, selected, group, of, people, which, is, an, action, that, at, least, their, victims, will, understand, to, be, evil, universalists, consider, evil, independent, of, culture, and, wholly, related, to, acts, or, intents, views, on, the, nature, of, evil, tend, to, fall, into, one, of, four, opposed, camps, plato, wrote, that, there, are, relatively, few, ways, to, do, good, but, there, are, countless, ways, to, do, evil, which, can, therefore, have, a, much, greater, impact, on, our, lives, and, the, lives, of, other, beings, capable, of, suffering, psychologist, albert, ellis, in, his, school, of, psychology, called, rational, emotive, behavioral, therapy, says, the, root, of, anger, and, the, desire, to, harm, someone, is, almost, always, related, to, variations, of, implicit, or, explicit, philosophical, beliefs, about, other, human, beings, he, further, claims, that, without, holding, variants, of, those, covert, or, overt, belief, and, assumptions, the, tendency, to, resort, to, violence, in, most, cases, is, less, likely, american, psychiatrist, m, scott, peck, on, the, other, hand, describes, evil, as, militant, ignorance, the, original, judeo, christian, concept, of, sin, is, as, a, process, that, leads, one, to, miss, the, mark, and, not, achieve, perfection, peck, argues, that, while, most, people, are, conscious, of, this, at, least, on, some, level, those, that, are, evil, actively, and, militantly, refuse, this, consciousness, peck, describes, evil, as, a, malignant, type, of, self, righteousness, which, results, in, a, projection, of, evil, onto, selected, specific, innocent, victims, often, children, or, other, people, in, relatively, powerless, positions, peck, considers, those, he, calls, evil, to, be, attempting, to, escape, and, hide, from, their, own, conscience, through, self, deception, and, views, this, as, being, quite, distinct, from, the, apparent, absence, of, conscience, evident, in, sociopaths, according, to, peck, an, evil, person, he, also, considers, certain, institutions, may, be, evil, as, his, discussion, of, the, my, lai, massacre, and, its, attempted, coverup, illustrate, by, this, definition, acts, of, criminal, and, state, terrorism, would, also, be, considered, evil, martin, luther, argued, that, there, are, cases, where, a, little, evil, is, a, positive, good, he, wrote, seek, out, the, society, of, your, boon, companions, drink, play, talk, bawdy, and, amuse, yourself, one, must, sometimes, commit, a, sin, out, of, hate, and, contempt, for, the, devil, so, as, not, to, give, him, the, chance, to, make, one, scrupulous, over, mere, nothings, the, necessary, evil, approach, to, politics, was, put, forth, by, niccol, machiavelli, a, 16th, century, florentine, writer, who, advised, tyrants, that, it, is, far, safer, to, be, feared, than, loved, treachery, deceit, eliminating, political, rivals, and, the, usage, of, fear, are, offered, as, methods, of, stabilizing, the, prince, s, security, and, power, the, international, relations, theories, of, realism, and, neorealism, sometimes, called, realpolitik, advise, politicians, to, explicitly, ban, absolute, moral, and, ethical, considerations, from, international, politics, and, to, focus, on, self, interest, political, survival, and, power, politics, which, they, hold, to, be, more, accurate, in, explaining, a, world, they, view, as, explicitly, amoral, and, dangerous, political, realists, usually, justify, their, perspectives, by, laying, claim, to, a, higher, moral, duty, specific, to, political, leaders, under, which, the, greatest, evil, is, seen, to, be, the, failure, of, the, state, to, protect, itself, and, its, citizens, machiavelli, wrote, there, will, be, traits, considered, good, that, if, followed, will, lead, to, ruin, while, other, traits, considered, vices, which, if, practiced, achieve, security, and, well, being, for, the, prince, anton, lavey, founder, of, the, church, of, satan, was, a, materialist, and, claimed, that, evil, is, actually, good, he, was, responding, to, the, common, practice, of, describing, sexuality, or, disbelief, as, evil, and, his, claim, was, that, when, the, word, evil, is, used, to, describe, the, natural, pleasures, and, instincts, of, men, and, women, or, the, skepticism, of, an, inquiring, mind, the, things, called, evil, are, really, good, john, rawls, book, a, theory, of, justice, prioritized, social, arrangements, and, goods, based, on, their, contribution, to, justice, rawls, defined, justice, as, fairness, especially, in, distributing, social, goods, defined, fairness, in, terms, of, procedures, and, attempted, to, prove, that, just, institutions, and, lives, are, good, if, rational, individuals, goods, are, considered, fairly, rawls, s, crucial, invention, was, the, original, position, a, procedure, in, which, one, tries, to, make, objective, moral, decisions, by, refusing, to, let, personal, facts, about, oneself, enter, one, s, moral, calculations, immanuel, kant, a, great, influence, for, rawls, similarly, applies, a, lot, of, procedural, practice, within, the, practical, application, of, the, categorical, imperative, however, this, is, indeed, not, based, solely, on, fairness, many, views, value, unity, as, a, good, to, go, beyond, eudaimonia, by, saying, that, an, individual, person, s, flourishing, is, valuable, only, as, a, means, to, the, flourishing, of, society, as, a, whole, in, other, words, a, single, person, s, life, is, ultimately, not, important, or, worthwhile, in, itself, but, is, good, only, as, a, means, to, the, success, of, society, as, a, whole, some, elements, of, confucianism, are, an, example, of, this, encouraging, the, view, that, people, ought, to, conform, as, individuals, to, demands, of, a, peaceful, and, ordered, society, according, to, the, naturalistic, view, the, flourishing, of, society, is, not, or, not, the, only, intrinsically, good, thing, defenses, of, this, notion, are, often, formulated, by, reference, to, biology, and, observations, that, living, things, compete, more, with, their, own, kind, than, with, other, kinds, rather, what, is, of, intrinsic, good, is, the, flourishing, of, all, sentient, life, extending, to, those, animals, that, have, some, level, of, similar, sentience, such, as, great, ape, personhood, others, go, farther, declaring, that, life, itself, is, of, intrinsic, value, by, another, approach, one, achieves, peace, and, agreement, by, focusing, not, on, one, s, peers, who, may, be, rivals, or, competitors, but, on, the, common, environment, the, reasoning, as, living, beings, it, is, clearly, and, objectively, good, that, we, are, surrounded, by, an, ecosystem, that, supports, life, indeed, if, we, weren, t, we, could, neither, discuss, that, good, nor, even, recognize, it, the, anthropic, principle, in, cosmology, recognizes, this, view, under, materialism, or, even, embodiment, values, or, in, any, system, that, recognizes, the, validity, of, ecology, as, a, scientific, study, of, limits, and, potentials, an, ecosystem, is, a, fundamental, good, to, all, who, investigate, it, seems, that, goodness, or, value, exists, within, an, ecosystem, earth, creatures, within, that, ecosystem, and, wholly, dependent, on, it, evaluate, good, relative, to, what, else, could, be, achieved, there, in, other, words, good, is, situated, in, a, particular, place, and, one, does, not, dismiss, everything, that, is, not, available, there, such, as, very, low, gravity, or, absolutely, abundant, sugar, candy, as, not, good, enough, one, works, within, its, constraints, transcending, them, and, learning, to, be, satisfied, with, them, is, thus, another, sort, of, value, perhaps, called, satisfaction, values, and, the, people, that, hold, them, seem, necessarily, subordinate, to, the, ecosystem, if, this, is, so, then, what, kind, of, being, could, validly, apply, the, word, good, to, an, ecosystem, as, a, whole, who, would, have, the, power, to, assess, and, judge, an, ecosystem, as, good, or, bad, by, what, criteria, and, by, what, criteria, would, ecosystems, be, modified, especially, larger, ones, such, as, the, atmosphere, climate, change, or, oceans, extinction, or, forests, deforestation, remaining, on, earth, as, the, most, basic, value, while, green, ethicists, have, been, most, forthright, about, it, and, have, developed, theories, of, gaia, philosophy, biophilia, bioregionalism, that, reflect, it, the, questions, are, now, universally, recognized, as, central, in, determining, value, e, g, the, economic, value, of, earth, to, humans, as, a, whole, or, the, value, of, life, that, is, neither, whole, earth, nor, human, many, have, come, to, the, conclusion, that, without, assuming, ecosystem, continuation, as, a, universal, good, with, attendant, virtues, like, biodiversity, and, ecological, wisdom, it, is, impossible, to, justify, such, operational, requirements, as, sustainability, of, human, activity, on, earth, one, response, is, that, humans, are, not, necessarily, confined, to, earth, and, could, use, it, and, move, on, a, counter, argument, is, that, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, humans, could, do, this, and, they, would, be, self, selected, by, ability, to, do, technological, escalation, on, others, for, instance, the, ability, to, create, large, spacecraft, to, flee, the, planet, in, and, simultaneously, fend, off, others, who, seek, to, prevent, them, another, counter, argument, is, that, extraterrestrial, life, would, encounter, the, fleeing, humans, and, destroy, them, as, a, locust, species, a, third, is, that, if, there, are, no, other, worlds, fit, to, support, life, and, no, extraterrestrials, who, compete, with, humans, to, occupy, them, it, is, both, futile, to, flee, and, foolish, to, imagine, that, it, would, take, less, energy, and, skill, to, protect, the, earth, as, a, habitat, than, it, would, take, to, construct, some, new, habitat, accordingly, remaining, on, earth, as, a, living, being, surrounded, by, a, working, ecosystem, is, a, fair, statement, of, the, most, basic, values, and, goodness, to, any, being, we, are, able, to, communicate, with, a, moral, system, without, this, axiom, seems, simply, not, actionable, however, most, religious, systems, acknowledge, an, afterlife, and, improving, this, is, seen, as, an, even, more, basic, good, in, many, other, moral, systems, also, remaining, on, earth, in, a, state, that, lacks, honor, or, power, over, self, is, less, desirable, consider, seppuku, in, bushido, kamikazes, or, the, role, of, suicide, attacks, in, jihadi, rhetoric, in, all, these, systems, remaining, on, earth, is, perhaps, no, higher, than, a, third, place, value, radical, values, environmentalism, can, be, seen, as, either, a, very, old, or, a, very, new, view, that, the, only, intrinsically, good, thing, is, a, flourishing, ecosystem, individuals, and, societies, are, merely, instrumentally, valuable, good, only, as, means, to, having, a, flourishing, ecosystem, the, gaia, philosophy, is, the, most, detailed, expression, of, this, overall, thought, but, it, strongly, influenced, deep, ecology, and, the, modern, green, parties, it, is, often, claimed, that, aboriginal, peoples, never, lost, this, sort, of, view, anthropological, linguistics, studies, links, between, their, languages, and, the, ecosystems, they, lived, in, which, gave, rise, to, their, knowledge, distinctions, very, often, environmental, cognition, and, moral, cognition, were, not, distinguished, in, these, languages, offenses, to, nature, were, like, those, to, other, people, and, animism, reinforced, this, by, giving, nature, personality, via, myth, anthropological, theories, of, value, explore, these, questions, most, people, in, the, world, reject, older, situated, ethics, and, localized, religious, views, however, small, community, based, and, ecology, centric, views, have, gained, some, popularity, in, recent, years, in, part, this, has, been, attributed, to, the, desire, for, ethical, certainties, such, a, deeply, rooted, definition, of, goodness, would, be, valuable, because, it, might, allow, one, to, construct, a, good, life, or, society, by, reliable, processes, of, deduction, elaboration, or, prioritisation, ones, that, relied, only, on, local, referents, one, could, verify, for, oneself, creating, more, certainty, and, therefore, less, investment, in, protection, hedging, and, insuring, against, consequences, of, loss, of, the, value, an, event, is, often, seen, as, being, of, value, simply, because, of, its, novelty, in, fashion, and, art, by, contrast, cultural, history, and, other, antiques, are, sometimes, seen, as, of, value, in, and, of, themselves, due, to, their, age, philosopher, historians, will, and, ariel, durant, spoke, as, much, with, the, quote, as, the, sanity, of, the, individual, lies, in, the, continuity, of, his, memories, so, the, sanity, of, the, group, lies, in, the, continuity, of, its, traditions, in, either, case, a, break, in, the, chain, invites, a, neurotic, reaction, the, lessons, of, history, 72, assessment, of, the, value, of, old, or, historical, artifacts, takes, into, consideration, especially, but, not, exclusively, the,

creativity, and, innovation, and, invention, are, sometimes, upheld, as, fundamentally, good, especially, in, western, industrial, society, all, imply, newness, and, even, opportunity, to, profit, from, novelty, bertrand, russell, was, notably, pessimistic, about, creativity, and, thought, that, knowledge, expanding, faster, than, wisdom, necessarily, was, fatal, the, issue, of, good, and, evil, in, the, human, visuality, often, associated, with, morality, is, regarded, by, some, biologists, notably, edward, o, wilson, jeremy, griffith, david, sloan, wilson, and, frans, de, waal, as, an, important, question, to, be, addressed, by, the, field, of, biology
