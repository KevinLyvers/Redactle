earliest, stratum, of, israelite, society, and, was, related, to, the, priest, who, was, not, originally, in, the, first, instance, a, sacrificer, but, as, with, the, old, arabs, custodian, of, the, sanctuary, oracle, priest, seer, and, holder, of, the, effective, future, creating, and, future, interpreting, word, of, power, the, blessing, and, the, curse, ecstatic, prophecy, nebiism, and, temple, priests, were, indigenous, to, canaanite, culture, and, represented, elements, adopted, by, the, israelites, with, the, fusion, of, the, functions, of, the, seer, priest, with, the, functions, of, the, temple, sacrificial, priests, and, ecstatic, prophets, two, main, groups, developed, the, priests, occupied, with, cult, and, sacrifice, and, the, prophets, who, continued, the, more, pneumatic, aspect, of, the, character, and, work, of, the, old, seers, and, were, mediums, of, the, divinely, inspired, word, which, was, whispered, to, them, or, came, to, them, the, prophets,

standards, in, the, torah, prophecy, often, consisted, of, a, conditioned, warning, by, their, god, of, the, consequences, should, the, society, specific, communities, or, their, leaders, not, adhere, to, the, torah, s, instructions, in, the, time, contemporary, with, the, prophet, s, life, prophecies, sometimes, included, conditioned, promises, of, blessing, for, obeying, their, god, and, returning, to, behaviors, and, laws, as, written, in, the, torah, conditioned, warning, prophecies, feature, in, all, jewish, works, of, the, tanakh, notably, maimonides, 1138, 1204, philosophically, suggested, that, there, once, were, many, levels, of, prophecy, from, the, highest, such, as, those, experienced, by, moses, to, the, lowest, where, the, individuals, were, able, to, apprehend, the, divine, will, but, not, respond, or, even, describe, this, experience, to, others, citing, for, example, shem, eber, and, most, notably, noah, who, in, the, biblical, narrative, does, not, issue, prophetic, declarations, maimonides, in, his, philosophical, work, the, guide, for, the, perplexed, outlines, twelve, modes, of, prophecy, from, lesser, to, greater, degree, of, clarity, the, tanakh, contains, prophecies, from, various, hebrew, prophets, 55, in, total, who, communicated, messages, from, god, to, the, nation, of, israel, and, later, to, the, population, of, judea, and, elsewhere, experience, of, prophecy, in, the, torah, and, the, rest, of, tanakh, was, not, restricted, to, jews, nor, was, the, prophetic, experience, restricted, to, the, hebrew, language, there, exists, a, problem, in, verifying, most, native, american, prophecy, in, that, they, remain, primarily, an, oral, tradition, and, thus, there, is, no, way, to, cite, references, of, where, writings, have, been, committed, to, paper, in, their, system, the, best, reference, is, an, elder, who, acts, as, a, repository, of, the, accumulated, wisdom, of, their, tradition, in, another, type, of, example, it, is, recorded, that, there, are, three, dogrib, prophets, who, had, claimed, to, have, been, divinely, inspired, to, bring, the, message, of, christianity, s, god, to, their, people, this, prophecy, among, the, dogrib, involves, elements, such, as, dances, and, trance, like, states, in, ancient, chinese, prophetic, texts, are, known, as, chen, the, most, famous, chinese, prophecy, is, the, tui, bei, tu, esoteric, prophecy, has, been, claimed, for, but, not, by, michel, de, nostredame, 1503, 1566, popularly, referred, to, as, nostradamus, who, claimed, to, be, a, converted, christian, it, is, known, that, he, suffered, several, tragedies, in, his, life, and, was, persecuted, to, some, degree, for, his, cryptic, esoteric, writings, about, the, future, reportedly, derived, through, a, use, of, a, crystal, ball, nostradamus, was, a, french, apothecary, and, reputed, seer, who, published, collections, of, foreknowledge, of, future, events, he, is, best, known, for, his, book, les, propheties, the, prophecies, the, first, edition, of, which, appeared, in, 1555, since, les, propheties, was, published, nostradamus, has, attracted, an, esoteric, following, that, along, with, the, popularistic, press, credits, him, with, foreseeing, world, events, his, esoteric, cryptic, foreseeings, have, in, some, cases, been, assimilated, to, the, results, of, applying, the, alleged, bible, code, as, well, as, to, other, purported, pseudo, prophetic, works, most, reliable, academic, sources, maintain, that, the, associations, made, between, world, events, and, nostradamus, s, quatrains, are, largely, the, result, of, misinterpretations, or, mistranslations, sometimes, deliberate, or, else, are, so, tenuous, as, to, render, them, useless, as, evidence, of, any, genuine, predictive, power, moreover, none, of, the, sources, listed, offers, any, evidence, that, anyone, has, ever, interpreted, any, of, nostradamus, s, pseudo, prophetic, works, specifically, enough, to, allow, a, clear, identification, of, any, event, in, advance, according, to, skeptics, many, apparently, fulfilled, prophecies, can, be, explained, as, coincidences, possibly, aided, by, the, prophecy, s, own, vagueness, and, others, may, have, been, invented, after, the, fact, to, match, the, circumstances, of, a, past, event, an, act, termed, postdiction, bill, whitcomb, in, the, magician, s, companion, observes, one, point, to, remember, is, that, the, probability, of, an, event, changes, as, soon, as, a, prophecy, or, divination, exists, the, accuracy, or, outcome, of, any, prophecy, is, altered, by, the, desires, and, attachments, of, the, seer, and, those, who, hear, the, prophecy, many, prophets, make, a, large, number, of, prophecies, this, makes, the, chances, of, at, least, one, prophecy, being, correct, much, higher, by, sheer, weight, of, numbers, the, phenomenon, of, prophecy, is, not, well, understood, in, psychology, research, literature, psychiatrist, and, neurologist, arthur, deikman, describes, the, phenomenon, as, an, intuitive, knowing, a, type, of, perception, that, bypasses, the, usual, sensory, channels, and, rational, intellect, p, rophecy, can, be, likened, to, a, bridge, between, the, individual, mystical, self, and, the, communal, mystical, body, writes, religious, sociologist, margaret, poloma, prophecy, seems, to, involve, the, free, association, that, occurred, through, the, workings, of, the, right, brain, psychologist, julian, jaynes, proposed, that, this, is, a, temporary, accessing, of, the, bicameral, mind, that, is, a, temporary, separating, of, functions, such, that, the, authoritarian, part, of, the, mind, seems, to, literally, be, speaking, to, the, person, as, if, a, separate, and, external, voice, jaynes, posits, that, the, gods, heard, as, voices, in, the, head, were, and, are, organizations, of, the, central, nervous, system, god, speaking, through, man, according, to, jaynes, is, a, more, recent, vestige, of, god, speaking, to, man, the, product, of, a, more, integrated, higher, self, when, the, bicameral, mind, speaks, there, is, no, introspection, in, earlier, times, posits, jaynes, there, was, additionally, a, visual, component, now, lost, child, development, and, consciousness, author, joseph, chilton, pearce, remarked, that, revelation, typically, appears, in, symbolic, form, and, in, a, single, flash, of, insight, he, used, the, metaphor, of, lightning, striking, and, suggests, that, the, revelation, is, a, result, of, a, buildup, of, resonant, potential, pearce, compared, it, to, the, earth, asking, a, question, and, the, sky, answering, it, focus, he, said, feeds, into, a, unified, field, of, like, resonance, and, becomes, capable, of, attracting, and, receiving, the, field, s, answer, when, it, does, form, some, cite, aspects, of, cognitive, psychology, such, as, pattern, forming, and, attention, to, the, formation, of, prophecy, in, modern, day, society, as, well, as,

to, each, other, yet, the, two, still, are, often, understood, together, as, symbiotic, in, their, origins, aims, and, purposes, middle, english, poems, of, a, political, nature, are, linked, with, latin, and, vernacular, prophecies, prophecies, in, this, sense, are, predictions, concerning, kingdoms, or, peoples, and, these, predictions, are, often, eschatological, or, apocalyptic, the,
