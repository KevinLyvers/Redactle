isaac, is, one, of, the, three, patriarchs, of, the, israelites, and, an, important, figure, in, the, abrahamic, religions, including, judaism, christianity, and, islam, isaac, first, appears, in, the, torah, in, which, he, is, the, son, of, abraham, and, sarah, the, father, of, jacob, and, esau, and, the, grandfather, of, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, isaac, s, name, means, he, will, laugh, reflecting, the, laughter, in, disbelief, of, abraham, and, sarah, when, told, by, god, that, they, would, have, a, child, he, is, the, only, patriarch, whose, name, was, not, changed, and, the, only, one, who, did, not, move, out, of, canaan, according, to, the, narrative, he, died, aged, 180, the, longest, lived, of, the, three, patriarchs, the, anglicized, name, isaac, is, a, transliteration, of, the, hebrew, name, y, q, which, literally, means, he, laughs, will, laugh, ugaritic, texts, dating, from, the, 13th, century, bce, refer, to, the, benevolent, smile, of, the, canaanite, deity, el, the, genesis, ascribes, the, laughter, to, isaac, s, parents, abraham, and, sarah, instead, according, to, the, biblical, narrative, abraham, fell, on, his, face, and, laughed, when, god, hebrew, elohim, imparted, the, news, of, their, son, s, eventual, birth, he, laughed, because, sarah, was, past, the, age, of, childbearing, both, she, and, abraham, were, advanced, in, age, later, when, sarah, overheard, three, messengers, of, the, lord, renew, the, promise, she, laughed, inwardly, for, the, same, reason, sarah, denied, laughing, when, god, questioned, abraham, about, it, after, god, changes, abram, and, sarai, s, names, to, abraham, and, sarah, he, tells, abraham, that, he, will, bear, a, second, son, by, sarah, named, isaac, with, whom, a, new, covenant, would, be, established, in, response, abraham, began, to, laugh, as, both, he, and, sarah, were, well, beyond, natural, child, bearing, age, some, time, later, three, men, who, abraham, identifies, as, messengers, of, god, visit, him, and, sarah, and, abraham, treats, them, to, food, and, niceties, they, repeat, the, prophecy, that, sarah, would, bear, a, child, promising, isaac, s, birth, within, a, year, s, time, at, which, point, sarah, laughs, in, disbelief, god, questions, why, the, pair, laughed, in, disbelief, at, his, words, and, if, it, is, because, they, believe, such, things, were, not, within, his, power, now, afraid, they, futilely, deny, ever, having, laughed, at, god, s, words, time, passes, as, isaac, is, born, isaac, was, abraham, s, second, son, and, firstborn, of, sarah, who, was, then, sarai, sarai, had, been, barren, for, a, long, time, and, sought, a, way, to, fulfill, god, s, promise, that, abram, would, be, father, of, many, nations, especially, since, they, had, grown, old, so, she, offered, hagar, to, abram, to, be, his, concubine, on, the, eighth, day, from, his, birth, isaac, was, circumcised, as, was, necessary, for, all, males, of, abraham, s, household, in, order, to, be, in, compliance, with, the, jewish, covenant, after, isaac, had, been, weaned, sarah, saw, ishmael, playing, with, or, mocking, him, the, hebrew, term, is, ambiguous, and, urged, her, husband, to, cast, out, hagar, the, bondservant, and, her, son, so, that, isaac, would, be, abraham, s, sole, heir, abraham, was, hesitant, but, at, god, s, order, he, listened, to, his, wife, s, request, at, some, point, in, isaac, s, youth, his, father, abraham, took, him, to, mount, moriah, at, god, s, command, as, the, last, of, ten, trials, to, test, his, faith, abraham, was, to, build, a, sacrificial, altar, and, sacrifice, his, son, isaac, upon, it, after, he, had, bound, his, son, to, the, altar, and, drawn, his, knife, to, kill, him, at, the, last, moment, an, angel, of, god, prevented, abraham, from, proceeding, instead, he, was, directed, to, sacrifice, a, nearby, ram, that, was, stuck, in, thickets, before, isaac, was, 40, genesis, 25, 20, abraham, sent, eliezer, his, steward, into, mesopotamia, to, find, a, wife, for, isaac, from, his, nephew, bethuel, s, family, eliezer, chose, the, aramean, rebekah, for, isaac, after, many, years, of, marriage, to, isaac, rebekah, had, still, not, given, birth, to, a, child, and, was, believed, to, be, barren, isaac, prayed, for, her, and, she, conceived, rebekah, gave, birth, to, twin, boys, esau, and, jacob, isaac, was, 60, years, old, when, his, two, sons, were, born, isaac, favored, esau, and, rebekah, favored, jacob, the, narratives, about, isaac, do, not, mention, his, having, concubines, isaac, moved, to, beer, lahai, roi, after, his, father, died, when, the, land, experienced, famine, he, moved, to, the, philistine, land, of, gerar, where, his, father, once, lived, this, land, was, still, under, the, control, of, king, abimelech, as, it, was, in, the, days, of, abraham, like, his, father, isaac, also, pretended, that, rebekah, was, his, sister, due, to, fear, that, abimelech, would, kill, him, in, order, to, take, her, he, had, gone, back, to, all, of, the, wells, that, his, father, dug, and, saw, that, they, were, all, stopped, up, with, earth, the, philistines, did, this, after, abraham, died, so, isaac, unearthed, them, and, began, to, dig, for, more, wells, all, the, way, to, beersheba, where, he, made, a, pact, with, abimelech, just, like, in, the, day, of, his, father, isaac, grew, old, and, became, blind, he, called, his, son, esau, and, directed, him, to, procure, some, venison, for, him, in, order, to, receive, isaac, s, blessing, while, esau, was, hunting, jacob, after, listening, to, his, mother, s, advice, deceived, his, blind, father, by, misrepresenting, himself, as, esau, and, thereby, obtained, his, father, s, blessing, such, that, jacob, became, isaac, s, primary, heir, and, esau, was, left, in, an, inferior, position, according, to, genesis, 25, 29, 34, esau, had, previously, sold, his, birthright, to, jacob, for, bread, and, stew, of, lentils, thereafter, isaac, sent, jacob, into, mesopotamia, to, take, a, wife, of, his, mother, s, brother, s, house, after, 20, years, working, for, his, uncle, laban, jacob, returned, home, he, reconciled, with, his, twin, brother, esau, then, he, and, esau, buried, their, father, isaac, in, hebron, after, he, died, at, the, age, of, 180, according, to, local, tradition, the, graves, of, isaac, and, rebekah, along, with, the, graves, of, abraham, and, sarah, and, jacob, and, leah, are, in, the, cave, of, the, patriarchs, in, rabbinical, tradition, the, age, of, isaac, at, the, time, of, binding, is, taken, to, be, 37, which, contrasts, with, common, portrayals, of, isaac, as, a, child, the, rabbis, also, thought, that, the, reason, for, the, death, of, sarah, was, the, news, of, the, intended, sacrifice, of, isaac, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, is, cited, in, appeals, for, the, mercy, of, god, in, later, jewish, traditions, the, post, biblical, jewish, interpretations, often, elaborate, the, role, of, isaac, beyond, the, biblical, description, and, primarily, focus, on, abraham, s, intended, sacrifice, of, isaac, called, the, aqedah, binding, according, to, a, version, of, these, interpretations, isaac, died, in, the, sacrifice, and, was, revived, according, to, many, accounts, of, aggadah, unlike, the, bible, it, is, satan, who, is, testing, isaac, as, an, agent, of, god, isaac, s, willingness, to, follow, god, s, command, at, the, cost, of, his, death, has, been, a, model, for, many, jews, who, preferred, martyrdom, to, violation, of, the, jewish, law, according, to, the, jewish, tradition, isaac, instituted, the, afternoon, prayer, this, tradition, is, based, on, genesis, chapter, 24, verse, 63, isaac, went, out, to, meditate, in, the, field, at, the, eventide, isaac, was, the, only, patriarch, who, stayed, in, canaan, during, his, whole, life, and, though, once, he, tried, to, leave, god, told, him, not, to, do, so, rabbinic, tradition, gave, the, explanation, that, isaac, was, almost, sacrificed, and, anything, dedicated, as, a, sacrifice, may, not, leave, the, land, of, israel, isaac, was, the, oldest, of, the, biblical, patriarchs, at, the, time, of, his, death, and, the, only, patriarch, whose, name, was, not, changed, rabbinic, literature, also, linked, isaac, s, blindness, in, old, age, as, stated, in, the, bible, to, the, sacrificial, binding, isaac, s, eyes, went, blind, because, the, tears, of, angels, present, at, the, time, of, his, sacrifice, fell, on, isaac, s, eyes, the, early, christian, church, continued, and, developed, the, new, testament, theme, of, isaac, as, a, type, of, christ, and, the, church, being, both, the, son, of, the, promise, and, the, father, of, the, faithful, tertullian, draws, a, parallel, between, isaac, s, bearing, the, wood, for, the, sacrificial, fire, with, christ, s, carrying, his, cross, and, there, was, a, general, agreement, that, while, all, the, sacrifices, of, the, old, law, were, anticipations, of, that, on, calvary, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, was, so, in, a, pre, eminent, way, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, the, roman, catholic, church, consider, isaac, as, a, saint, along, with, other, biblical, patriarchs, along, with, those, of, other, patriarchs, and, the, old, testament, righteous, his, feast, day, is, celebrated, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, the, byzantine, rite, of, the, catholic, church, on, the, second, sunday, before, christmas, december, 11, 17, under, the, title, the, sunday, of, the, forefathers, isaac, is, commemorated, in, the, catholic, church, on, 25, march, or, on, 17, december, the, new, testament, states, isaac, was, offered, up, by, his, father, abraham, and, that, isaac, blessed, his, sons, paul, contrasted, isaac, symbolizing, christian, liberty, with, the, rejected, older, son, ishmael, symbolizing, slavery, hagar, is, associated, with, the, sinai, covenant, while, sarah, is, associated, with, the, covenant, of, grace, into, which, her, son, isaac, enters, the, epistle, of, james, chapter, 2, verses, 21, 24, states, that, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, shows, that, justification, in, the, johannine, sense, requires, both, faith, and, works, in, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, abraham, s, willingness, to, follow, god, s, command, to, sacrifice, isaac, is, used, as, an, example, of, faith, as, is, isaac, s, action, in, blessing, jacob, and, esau, with, reference, to, the, future, promised, by, god, to, abraham, in, verse, 19, the, author, views, the, release, of, isaac, from, sacrifice, as, analogous, to, the, resurrection, of, jesus, the, idea, of, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, being, a, prefigurement, of, the, sacrifice, of, jesus, on, the, cross, islam, considers, isaac, arabic, romanized, is, q, a, prophet, and, describes, him, as, the, father, of, the, israelites, and, a, righteous, servant, of, god, isaac, along, with, ishmael, is, highly, important, for, muslims, for, continuing, to, preach, the, message, of, monotheism, after, his, father, abraham, among, isaac, s, children, was, the, follow, up, israelite, patriarch, jacob, who, is, also, venerated, as, an, islamic, prophet, isaac, is, mentioned, seventeen, times, by, name, in, the, quran, often, with, his, father, and, his, son, jacob, the, quran, states, that, abraham, received, good, tidings, of, isaac, a, prophet, of, the, righteous, and, that, god, blessed, them, both, 37, 112, in, a, fuller, description, when, angels, came, to, abraham, to, tell, him, of, the, future, punishment, to, be, imposed, on, sodom, and, gomorrah, his, wife, sarah, laughed, and, we, gave, her, good, tidings, of, isaac, and, after, isaac, of, a, grandson, jacob, 11, 71, 74, and, it, is, further, explained, that, this, event, will, take, place, despite, abraham, and, sarah, s, old, age, several, verses, speak, of, isaac, as, a, gift, to, abraham, 6, 84, 14, 49, 50, and, 24, 26, 27, adds, that, god, made, prophethood, and, the, book, to, be, among, his, offspring, which, has, been, interpreted, to, refer, to, abraham, s, two, prophetic, sons, his, prophetic, grandson, jacob, and, his, prophetic, great, grandson, joseph, in, the, quran, it, later, narrates, that, abraham, also, praised, god, for, giving, him, ishmael, and, isaac, in, his, old, age, 14, 39, 41, elsewhere, in, the, quran, isaac, is, mentioned, in, lists, joseph, follows, the, religion, of, his, forefathers, abraham, isaac, and, jacob, 12, 38, and, speaks, of, god, s, favor, to, them, 12, 6, jacob, s, sons, all, testify, their, faith, and, promise, to, worship, the, god, that, their, forefathers, abraham, ishmael, and, isaac, worshiped, 2, 127, and, the, quran, commands, muslims, to, believe, in, the, revelations, that, were, given, to, abraham, ishmael, isaac, jacob, and, the, patriarchs, 2, 136, 3, 84, in, the, quran, s, narrative, of, abraham, s, near, sacrifice, of, his, son, 37, 102, the, name, of, the, son, is, not, mentioned, and, debate, has, continued, over, the, son, s, identity, though, many, feel, that, the, identity, is, the, least, important, element, in, a, story, which, is, given, to, show, the, courage, that, one, develops, through, faith, the, quran, mentions, isaac, as, a, prophet, and, a, righteous, man, of, god, isaac, and, jacob, are, mentioned, as, being, bestowed, upon, abraham, as, gifts, of, god, who, then, worshipped, god, only, and, were, righteous, leaders, in, the, way, of, god, and, we, bestowed, on, him, isaac, and, as, an, additional, gift, a, grandson, jacob, and, we, made, righteous, men, of, every, one, of, them, and, we, made, them, leaders, guiding, men, by, our, command, and, we, sent, them, inspiration, to, do, good, deeds, to, establish, regular, prayers, and, to, practise, regular, charity, and, they, constantly, served, us, and, us, only, and, we, gave, him, the, glad, tidings, of, isaac, a, prophet, and, one, of, the, righteous, some, scholars, have, described, isaac, as, a, legendary, figure, or, as, a, figure, representing, tribal, history, or, as, a, seminomadic, leader, the, stories, of, isaac, like, other, patriarchal, stories, of, genesis, are, generally, believed, to, have, their, origin, in, folk, memories, and, oral, traditions, of, the, early, hebrew, pastoralist, experience, the, cambridge, companion, to, the, bible, makes, the, following, comment, on, the, biblical, stories, of, the, patriarchs, yet, for, all, that, these, stories, maintain, a, distance, between, their, world, and, that, of, their, time, of, literary, growth, and, composition, they, reflect, the, political, realities, of, the, later, periods, many, of, the, narratives, deal, with, the, relationship, between, the, ancestors, and, peoples, who, were, part, of, israel, s, political, world, at, the, time, the, stories, began, to, be, written, down, eighth, century, b, c, e, lot, is, the, ancestor, of, the, transjordanian, peoples, of, ammon, and, moab, and, ishmael, personifies, the, nomadic, peoples, known, to, have, inhabited, north, arabia, although, located, in, the, old, testament, in, the, negev, esau, personifies, edom, 36, 1, and, laban, represents, the, aramean, states, to, israel, s, north, a, persistent, theme, is, that, of, difference, between, the, ancestors, and, the, indigenous, canaanites, in, fact, the, theme, of, the, differences, between, judah, and, israel, as, personified, by, the, ancestors, and, the, neighboring, peoples, of, the, time, of, the, monarchy, is, pressed, effectively, into, theological, service, to, articulate, the, choosing, by, god, of, judah, and, israel, to, bring, blessing, to, all, peoples, according, to, martin, noth, a, scholar, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, narratives, of, isaac, date, back, to, an, older, cultural, stage, than, that, of, the, west, jordanian, jacob, at, that, era, the, israelite, tribes, were, not, yet, sedentary, in, the, course, of, looking, for, grazing, areas, they, had, come, in, contact, in, southern, philistia, with, the, inhabitants, of, the, settled, countryside, it, has, also, been, argued, that, the, form, of, isaac, s, name, as, found, in, the, hebrew, bible, is, most, frequently, attested, in, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bce, rather, than, in, later, periods, the, biblical, historian, a, jopsen, believes, in, the, connection, between, the, isaac, traditions, and, the, north, and, in, support, of, this, theory, adduces, amos, 7, 9, the, high, places, of, isaac, albrecht, alt, and, martin, noth, hold, that, the, figure, of, isaac, was, enhanced, when, the, theme, of, promise, previously, bound, to, the, cults, of, the, god, the, fathers, was, incorporated, into, the, israelite, creed, during, the, southern, palestinian, stage, of, the, growth, of, the, pentateuch, tradition, according, to, martin, noth, at, the, southern, palestinian, stage, of, the, growth, of, the, pentateuch, tradition, isaac, became, established, as, one, of, the, biblical, patriarchs, but, his, traditions, were, receded, in, the, favor, of, abraham, israel, finkelstein, and, thomas, r, mer, have, proposed, that, isaac, might, be, the, ancestor, worshipped, in, beersheba, and, the, oldest, tradition, about, him, might, be, an, ancestor, myth, dating, back, to, at, least, 8th, century, bce, as, shown, in, amos, 7, 9, while, proposing, that, the, story, about, him, conflicting, with, abimelech, king, of, gerar, and, philistines, which, is, the, story, that, has, possibility, that, abraham, cycle, could, have, vampirized, or, vice, versa, could, have, been, originated, and, have, background, in, 7th, century, bce, and, could, be, made, to, aim, at, justifying, and, legitimizing, the, claim, of, judah, over, the, judahite, territories, that, are, transferred, to, the, philistine, cities, by, sennacherib, because, of, several, reasons, it, was, time, when, gerar, tel, haror, had, the, special, importance, and, fortified, assyrian, administration, center, there, was, king, of, ashdod, ahimilki, whose, name, is, similar, to, that, of, abimelech, the, kingdom, of, judah, could, have, gotten, back, parts, of, judahite, territories, while, judah, was, a, compliant, vassal, of, assyria, under, manasseh, in, addition, finkelstein, and, r, mer, proposed, that, abraham, might, be, the, ancestor, worshipped, in, hebron, and, jacob, might, be, the, ancestor, worshipped, in, israel, but, the, earliest, tradition, of, jacob, the, tradition, about, him, and, his, uncle, laban, the, aramean, establishing, the, border, between, them, might, be, originated, in, gilead, the, earliest, christian, portrayal, of, isaac, is, found, in, the, roman, catacomb, frescoes, excluding, the, fragments, alison, moore, smith, classifies, these, artistic, works, in, three, categories, abraham, leads, isaac, towards, the, altar, or, isaac, approaches, with, the, bundle, of, sticks, abraham, having, preceded, him, to, the, place, of, offering, abraham, is, upon, a, pedestal, and, isaac, stands, near, at, hand, both, figures, in, orant, attitude, abraham, is, shown, about, to, sacrifice, isaac, while, the, latter, stands, or, kneels, on, the, ground, beside, the, altar, sometimes, abraham, grasps, isaac, by, the, hair, occasionally, the, ram, is, added, to, the, scene, and, in, the, later, paintings, the, hand, of, god, emerges, from, above
