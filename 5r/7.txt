translation, of, the, i, ching, he, explains, that, this, chinese, view, of, the, world, is, based, not, on, science, as, the, west, knows, it, but, on, chance, according, to, the, british, philosopher, victoria, s, harrison, the, category, of, eastern, philosophy, and, similarly, asian, philosophy, and, oriental, philosophy, is, a, product, of, 19th, century, western, scholarship, and, did, not, exist, in, east, asia, or, india, this, is, because, in, asia, there, is, no, single, unified, philosophical, tradition, with, a, single, root, but, various, autonomous, traditions, that, have, come, into, contact, with, each, other, over, time, some, eurocentric, thinkers, claim, that, philosophy, as, such, is, only, characteristic, of, western, cultures, the, german, philosopher, martin, heidegger, is, reported, to, have, said, that, only, greek, and, german, languages, are, suitable, for, philosophizing, it, is, still, commonplace, in, western, universities, to, teach, only, western, philosophy, and, to, ignore, asian, philosophy, altogether, or, consider, only, newer, western, influenced, asian, thought, proper, philosophy, carine, defoort, herself, a, specialist, in, chinese, thought, has, offered, support, for, such, a, family, view, of, philosophy, while, rein, raud, has, presented, an, argument, against, it, and, offered, a, more, flexible, definition, of, philosophy, that, would, include, both, western, and, asian, thought, on, equal, terms, in, response, ouyang, min, argues, that, philosophy, proper, is, a, western, cultural, practice, and, essentially, different, from, zhexue, which, is, what, the, chinese, have, even, though, zhexue, originally, tetsugaku, is, actually, a, neologism, coined, in, 1873, by, nishi, amane, for, describing, western, philosophy, as, opposed, to, traditional, asian, thought
