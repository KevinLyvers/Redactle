bible, translators, theologians, lutheranism, is, a, major, branch, of, protestantism, that, identifies, primarily, with, the, theology, of, martin, luther, the, 16th, century, german, monk, and, reformer, whose, efforts, to, reform, the, theology, and, practices, of, the, catholic, church, launched, the, reformation, in, 1517, lutheranism, subsequently, became, the, state, religion, of, many, parts, of, northern, europe, in, 1521, the, split, between, lutherans, and, the, roman, catholic, church, was, made, public, and, clear, with, the, edict, of, worms, in, which, the, diet, condemned, luther, and, officially, banned, citizens, of, the, holy, roman, empire, from, defending, or, propagating, luther, s, ideas, subjecting, advocates, of, lutheranism, to, forfeiture, of, all, property, with, half, forfeited, to, the, imperial, government, and, the, remaining, half, forfeited, to, the, accusing, party, the, divide, centered, primarily, on, two, points, the, proper, source, of, authority, in, the, church, often, called, the, formal, principle, of, the, reformation, and, the, doctrine, of, justification, the, material, principle, of, lutheran, theology, lutheranism, advocates, a, doctrine, of, justification, by, grace, alone, through, faith, alone, on, the, basis, of, scripture, alone, the, doctrine, that, scripture, is, the, final, authority, on, all, matters, of, faith, this, contrasts, with, the, belief, of, the, roman, catholic, church, defined, at, the, council, of, trent, which, contends, that, final, authority, comes, from, both, scripture, and, tradition, unlike, calvinism, lutheranism, retains, many, of, the, liturgical, practices, and, sacramental, teachings, of, the, pre, reformation, western, church, with, a, particular, emphasis, on, the, eucharist, or, lord, s, supper, although, eastern, lutheranism, uses, the, byzantine, rite, lutheran, theology, differs, from, reformed, theology, in, christology, divine, grace, the, purpose, of, god, s, law, the, concept, of, perseverance, of, the, saints, and, predestination, amongst, other, matters, the, name, lutheran, originated, as, a, derogatory, term, used, against, luther, by, german, scholastic, theologian, johann, maier, von, eck, during, the, leipzig, debate, in, july, 1519, eck, and, other, roman, catholics, followed, the, traditional, practice, of, naming, a, heresy, after, its, leader, thus, labeling, all, who, identified, with, the, theology, of, martin, luther, as, lutherans, martin, luther, always, disliked, the, term, lutheran, preferring, the, term, evangelical, which, was, derived, from, euangelion, a, greek, word, meaning, good, news, i, e, gospel, the, followers, of, john, calvin, huldrych, zwingli, and, other, theologians, linked, to, the, reformed, tradition, also, used, that, term, to, distinguish, the, two, evangelical, groups, others, began, to, refer, to, the, two, groups, as, evangelical, lutheran, and, evangelical, reformed, as, time, passed, by, the, word, evangelical, was, dropped, lutherans, themselves, began, to, use, the, term, lutheran, in, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, in, order, to, distinguish, themselves, from, other, groups, such, as, the, anabaptists, and, calvinists, in, 1597, theologians, in, wittenberg, defined, the, title, lutheran, as, referring, to, the, true, church, lutheranism, has, its, roots, in, the, work, of, martin, luther, who, sought, to, reform, the, western, church, to, what, he, considered, a, more, biblical, foundation, the, reaction, of, the, government, and, church, authorities, to, the, international, spread, of, his, writings, beginning, with, the, ninety, five, theses, divided, western, christianity, during, the, reformation, lutheranism, became, the, state, religion, of, numerous, states, of, northern, europe, especially, in, northern, germany, scandinavia, and, the, then, livonian, order, lutheran, clergy, became, civil, servants, and, the, lutheran, churches, became, part, of, the, state, lutheranism, spread, through, all, of, scandinavia, during, the, 16th, century, as, the, monarchs, of, denmark, norway, and, sweden, adopted, the, faith, through, baltic, german, and, swedish, rule, lutheranism, also, spread, into, estonia, and, latvia, it, also, began, spreading, into, lithuania, proper, with, practically, all, members, of, the, lithuanian, nobility, converting, to, lutheranism, or, calvinism, but, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, protestantism, at, large, began, losing, support, due, to, the, counter, reformation, and, religious, persecutions, in, german, ruled, lithuania, minor, however, lutheranism, remained, the, dominant, branch, of, christianity, lutheranism, played, a, crucial, role, in, preserving, the, lithuanian, language, since, 1520, regular, lutheran, services, have, been, held, in, copenhagen, under, the, reign, of, frederick, i, 1523, 1533, denmark, norway, remained, officially, catholic, although, frederick, initially, pledged, to, persecute, lutherans, he, soon, adopted, a, policy, of, protecting, lutheran, preachers, and, reformers, the, most, significant, of, which, was, hans, tausen, during, frederick, s, reign, lutheranism, made, significant, inroads, in, denmark, at, an, open, meeting, in, copenhagen, attended, by, king, christian, iii, in, 1536, the, people, shouted, we, will, stand, by, the, holy, gospel, and, do, not, want, such, bishops, anymore, frederick, s, son, was, openly, lutheran, which, prevented, his, election, to, the, throne, upon, his, father, s, death, in, 1533, however, following, his, victory, in, the, civil, war, that, followed, in, 1536, he, became, christian, iii, and, advanced, the, reformation, in, denmark, norway, the, constitution, upon, which, the, danish, norwegian, church, according, to, the, church, ordinance, should, rest, was, the, pure, word, of, god, which, is, the, law, and, the, gospel, it, does, not, mention, the, augsburg, confession, the, priests, had, to, understand, the, holy, scripture, well, enough, to, preach, and, explain, the, gospel, and, the, epistles, to, their, congregations, the, youths, were, taught, from, luther, s, small, catechism, available, in, danish, since, 1532, they, were, taught, to, expect, at, the, end, of, life, forgiving, of, their, sins, to, be, counted, as, just, and, the, eternal, life, instruction, is, still, similar, the, first, complete, bible, in, danish, was, based, on, martin, luther, s, translation, into, german, it, was, published, in, 1550, with, 3, 000, copies, printed, in, the, first, edition, a, second, edition, was, published, in, 1589, unlike, catholicism, lutheranism, does, not, believe, that, tradition, is, a, carrier, of, the, word, of, god, or, that, only, the, communion, of, the, bishop, of, rome, has, been, entrusted, to, interpret, the, word, of, god, the, reformation, in, sweden, began, with, olaus, and, laurentius, petri, brothers, who, took, the, reformation, to, sweden, after, studying, in, germany, they, led, gustav, vasa, elected, king, in, 1523, to, lutheranism, the, pope, s, refusal, to, allow, the, replacement, of, an, archbishop, who, had, supported, the, invading, forces, opposing, gustav, vasa, during, the, stockholm, bloodbath, led, to, the, severing, of, any, official, connection, between, sweden, and, the, papacy, in, 1523, four, years, later, at, the, diet, of, v, ster, s, the, king, succeeded, in, forcing, the, diet, to, accept, his, dominion, over, the, national, church, the, king, was, given, possession, of, all, church, properties, as, well, as, the, church, appointments, and, approval, of, the, clergy, while, this, effectively, granted, official, sanction, to, lutheran, ideas, lutheranism, did, not, become, official, until, 1593, at, that, time, the, uppsala, synod, declared, holy, scripture, the, sole, guideline, for, faith, with, four, documents, accepted, as, faithful, and, authoritative, explanations, of, it, the, apostles, creed, the, nicene, creed, the, athanasian, creed, and, the, unaltered, augsburg, confession, of, 1530, mikael, agricola, s, translation, of,

rulers, in, 1547, soon, holy, roman, imperial, forces, joined, the, battle, and, conquered, the, members, of, the, schmalkaldic, league, oppressing, and, exiling, many, german, lutherans, as, they, enforced, the, terms, of, the, augsburg, interim, religious, freedom, in, some, areas, was, secured, for, lutherans, through, the, peace, of, passau, in, 1552, and, under, the, legal, principle, of, cuius, regio, eius, religio, the, religion, of, the, ruler, was, to, dictate, the, religion, of, those, ruled, and, the, declaratio, ferdinandei, limited, religious, tolerance, clauses, of, the, peace, of, augsburg, in, 1555, religious, disputes, among, the, crypto, calvinists, philippists, sacramentarians, ubiquitarians, and, gnesio, lutherans, raged, within, lutheranism, during, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, these, finally, ended, with, the, resolution, of, the, issues, in, the, formula, of, concord, large, numbers, of, politically, and, religiously, influential, leaders, met, together, debated, and, resolved, these, topics, on, the, basis, of, scripture, resulting, in, the, formula, which, over, 8, 000, leaders, signed, the, book, of, concord, replaced, earlier, incomplete, collections, of, doctrine, unifying, all, german, lutherans, with, identical, doctrine, and, beginning, the, period, of, lutheran, orthodoxy, in, lands, where, catholicism, was, the, state, religion, lutheranism, was, officially, illegal, although, enforcement, varied, until, the, end, of, the, counter, reformation, some, lutherans, worshipped, secretly, such, as, at, the, hundskirke, which, translates, as, dog, church, or, dog, altar, a, triangle, shaped, communion, rock, in, a, ditch, between, crosses, in, paternion, austria, the, crowned, serpent, is, possibly, an, allusion, to, ferdinand, ii, holy, roman, emperor, while, the, dog, possibly, refers, to, peter, canisius, another, figure, interpreted, as, a, snail, carrying, a, church, tower, is, possibly, a, metaphor, for, the, protestant, church, also, on, the, rock, is, the, number, 1599, and, a, phrase, translating, as, thus, gets, in, the, world, the, historical, period, of, lutheran, orthodoxy, is, divided, into, three, sections, early, orthodoxy, 1580, 1600, high, orthodoxy, 1600, 1685, and, late, orthodoxy, 1685, 1730, lutheran, scholasticism, developed, gradually, especially, for, the, purpose, of, arguing, with, the, jesuits, and, it, was, finally, established, by, johann, gerhard, abraham, calovius, represents, the, climax, of, the, scholastic, paradigm, in, orthodox, lutheranism,

conrad, dannhauer, johannes, andreas, quenstedt, johann, friedrich, k, nig, and, johann, wilhelm, baier, near, the, end, of, the, thirty, years, war, the, compromising, spirit, seen, in, philip, melanchthon, rose, up, again, in, the, helmstedt, school, and, especially, in, theology, of, georgius, calixtus, causing, the, syncretistic, controversy, another, theological, issue, that, arose, was, the, crypto, kenotic, controversy, late, orthodoxy, was, torn, by, influences, from, rationalism, philosophy, based, on, reason, and, pietism, a, revival, movement, in, lutheranism, after, a, century, of, vitality, the, pietist, theologians, philipp, jakob, spener, and, august, hermann, francke, warned, that, orthodoxy, had, degenerated, into, meaningless, intellectualism, and, formalism, while, orthodox, theologians, found, the, emotional, and, subjective, focuses, of, pietism, to, be, vulnerable, to, rationalist, propaganda, in, 1688, the, finnish, radical, pietist, lars, ulstadius, ran, down, the, main, aisle, of, turku, cathedral, naked, while, screaming, that, the, disgrace, of, finnish, clergymen, would, be, revealed, like, his, current, disgrace, the, last, famous, orthodox,

pietism, medieval, mystical, traditions, continued, in, the, works, of, martin, moller, johann, arndt, and, joachim, l, tkemann, pietism, became, a, rival, of, orthodoxy, but, adopted, some, devotional, literature, by, orthodox, theologians, including, arndt, christian, scriver, and, stephan, pr, torius, rationalist, philosophers, from, france, and, england, had, an, enormous, impact, during, the, 18th, century, along, with, the, german, rationalists, christian, wolff, gottfried, leibniz, and, immanuel, kant, their, work, led, to, an, increase, in, rationalist, beliefs, at, the, expense, of, faith, in, god, and, agreement, with, the, bible, in, 1709, valentin, ernst, l, scher, warned, that, this, new, rationalist, view, of, the, world, fundamentally, changed, society, by, drawing, into, question, every, aspect, of, theology, instead, of, considering, the, authority, of, divine, revelation, he, explained, rationalists, relied, solely, on, their, personal, understanding, when, searching, for, truth, johann, melchior, goeze, 1717, 1786, pastor, of, st, catherine, s, church, in, hamburg, wrote, apologetical, works, against, rationalists, including, a, theological, and, historical, defence, against, the, historical, criticism, of, the, bible, dissenting, lutheran, pastors, were, often, reprimanded, by, the, government, bureaucracy, overseeing, them, for, example, when, they, tried, to, correct, rationalist, influences, in, the, parish, school, as, a, result, of, the, impact, of, a, local, form, of, rationalism, termed, neology, by, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, genuine, piety, was, found, almost, solely, in, small, pietist, conventicles, however, some, of, the, laity, preserved, lutheran, orthodoxy, from, both, pietism, and, rationalism, by, reusing, old, catechisms, hymnbooks, postils, and, devotional, writings, including, those, written, by, johann, gerhard, heinrich, m, ller, and, christian, scriver, luther, scholar, johann, georg, hamann, 1730, 1788, a, layman, became, famous, for, countering, rationalism, and, striving, to, advance, a, revival, known, as, the, erweckung, or, awakening, in, 1806, napoleon, s, invasion, of, germany, promoted, rationalism, and, angered, german, lutherans, stirring, up, a, desire, among, the, people, to, preserve, luther, s, theology, from, the, rationalist, threat, those, associated, with, this, awakening, held, that, reason, was, insufficient, and, pointed, out, the, importance, of, emotional, religious, experiences, small, groups, sprang, up, often, in, universities, which, devoted, themselves, to, bible, study, reading, devotional, writings, and, revival, meetings, although, the, beginning, of, this, awakening, tended, heavily, toward, romanticism, patriotism, and, experience, the, emphasis, of, the, awakening, shifted, around, 1830, to, restoring, the, traditional, liturgy, doctrine, and, confessions, of, lutheranism, in, the, neo, lutheran, movement, this, awakening, swept, through, all, of, scandinavia, except, iceland, it, developed, from, both, german, neo, lutheranism, and, pietism, danish, pastor, and, philosopher, n, f, s, grundtvig, reshaped, church, life, throughout, denmark, through, a, reform, movement, beginning, in, 1830, he, also, wrote, about, 1, 500, hymns, including, god, s, word, is, our, great, heritage, in, norway, hans, nielsen, hauge, a, lay, street, preacher, emphasized, spiritual, discipline, and, sparked, the, haugean, movement, which, was, followed, by, the, johnsonian, awakening, within, the, state, church, the, awakening, drove, the, growth, of, foreign, missions, in, norway, to, non, christians, to, a, new, height, which, has, never, been, reached, since, in, sweden, lars, levi, l, stadius, began, the, laestadian, movement, that, emphasized, moral, reform, in, finland, a, farmer, paavo, ruotsalainen, began, the, finnish, awakening, when, he, took, to, preaching, about, repentance, and, prayer, in, 1817, frederick, william, iii, of, prussia, ordered, the, lutheran, and, reformed, churches, in, his, territory, to, unite, forming, the, prussian, union, of, churches, the, unification, of, the, two, branches, of, german, protestantism, sparked, the, schism, of, the, old, lutherans, many, lutherans, called, old, lutherans, chose, to, leave, the, state, churches, despite, imprisonment, and, military, force, some, formed, independent, church, bodies, or, free, churches, at, home, while, others, left, for, the, united, states, canada, and, australia, a, similar, legislated, merger, in, silesia, prompted, thousands, to, join, the, old, lutheran, movement, the, dispute, over, ecumenism, overshadowed, other, controversies, within, german, lutheranism, despite, political, meddling, in, church, life, local, and, national, leaders, sought, to, restore, and, renew, christianity, neo, lutheran, johann, konrad, wilhelm, l, he, and, old, lutheran, free, church, leader, friedrich, august, br, nn, both, sent, young, men, overseas, to, serve, as, pastors, to, german, americans, while, the, inner, mission, focused, on, renewing, the, situation, home, johann, gottfried, herder, superintendent, at, weimar, and, part, of, the, inner, mission, movement, joined, with, the, romantic, movement, with, his, quest, to, preserve, human, emotion, and, experience, from, rationalism, ernst, wilhelm, hengstenberg, though, raised, reformed, became, convinced, of, the, truth, of, historic, lutheranism, as, a, young, man, he, led, the, neo, lutheran, repristination, school, of, theology, which, advocated, a, return, to, the, orthodox, theologians, of, the, 17th, century, and, opposed, modern, bible, scholarship, as, editor, of, the, periodical, evangelische, kirchenzeitung, he, developed, it, into, a, major, support, of, neo, lutheran, revival, and, used, it, to, attack, all, forms, of, theological, liberalism, and, rationalism, although, he, received, a, large, amount, of, slander, and, ridicule, during, his, forty, years, at, the, head, of, revival, he, never, gave, up, his, positions, the, theological, faculty, at, the, university, of, erlangen, in, bavaria, became, another, force, for, reform, there, professor, adolf, von, harless, though, previously, an, adherent, of, rationalism, and, german, idealism, made, erlangen, a, magnet, for, revival, oriented, theologians, termed, the, erlangen, school, of, theology, they, developed, a, new, version, of, the, incarnation, which, they, felt, emphasized, the, humanity, of, jesus, better, than, the, ecumenical, creeds, as, theologians, they, used, both, modern, historical, critical, and, hegelian, philosophical, methods, instead, of, attempting, to, revive, the, orthodoxy, of, the, 17th, century, friedrich, julius, stahl, led, the, high, church, lutherans, though, raised, jewish, he, was, baptized, as, a, christian, at, the, age, of, 19, through, the, influence, of, the, lutheran, school, he, attended, as, the, leader, of, a, neofeudal, prussian, political, party, he, campaigned, for, the, divine, right, of, kings, the, power, of, the, nobility, and, episcopal, polity, for, the, church, along, with, theodor, kliefoth, and, august, friedrich, christian, vilmar, he, promoted, agreement, with, the, roman, catholic, church, with, regard, to, the, authority, of, the, institutional, church, ex, opere, operato, effectiveness, of, the, sacraments, and, the, divine, authority, of, clergy, unlike, catholics, however, they, also, urged, complete, agreement, with, the, book, of, concord, the, neo, lutheran, movement, managed, to, slow, secularism, and, counter, atheistic, marxism, but, it, did, not, fully, succeed, in, europe, it, partly, succeeded, in, continuing, the, pietist, movement, s, drive, to, right, social, wrongs, and, focus, on, individual, conversion, the, neo, lutheran, call, to, renewal, failed, to, achieve, widespread, popular, acceptance, because, it, both, began, and, continued, with, a, lofty, idealistic, romanticism, that, did, not, connect, with, an, increasingly, industrialized, and, secularized, europe, the, work, of, local, leaders, resulted, in, specific, areas, of, vibrant, spiritual, renewal, but, people, in, lutheran, areas, became, increasingly, distant, from, church, life, additionally, the, revival, movements, were, divided, by, philosophical, traditions, the, repristination, school, and, old, lutherans, tended, towards, kantianism, while, the, erlangen, school, promoted, a, conservative, hegelian, perspective, by, 1969, manfried, kober, complained, that, unbelief, is, rampant, even, within, german, lutheran, parishes, traditionally, lutherans, hold, the, scriptures, of, the, old, and, new, testaments, to, be, the, only, divinely, inspired, books, the, only, presently, available, sources, of, divinely, revealed, knowledge, and, the, only, infallible, source, of, christian, doctrine, scripture, alone, is, the, formal, principle, of, the, faith, the, final, authority, for, all, matters, of, faith, and, morals, because, of, its, inspiration, authority, clarity, efficacy, and, sufficiency, the, authority, of, the, scriptures, has, been, challenged, during, the, history, of, lutheranism, martin, luther, taught, that, the, bible, was, the, written, word, of, god, and, the, only, infallible, guide, for, faith, and, practice, he, held, that, every, passage, of, scripture, has, one, straightforward, meaning, the, literal, sense, as, interpreted, by, other, scripture, these, teachings, were, accepted, during, the, orthodox, lutheranism, of, the, 17th, century, during, the, 18th, century, rationalism, advocated, reason, rather, than, the, authority, of, the, bible, as, the, final, source, of, knowledge, but, most, of, the, laity, did, not, accept, this, rationalist, position, in, the, 19th, century, a, confessional, revival, re, emphasized, the, authority, of, the, scriptures, and, agreement, with, the, lutheran, confessions, today, lutherans, disagree, about, the, inspiration, and, authority, of, the, bible, theological, conservatives, use, the, historical, grammatical, method, of, biblical, interpretation, while, theological, liberals, use, the, higher, critical, method, the, 2008, u, s, religious, landscape, survey, conducted, by, the, pew, research, center, surveyed, 1,

does, not, merely, contain, the, word, of, god, but, every, word, of, it, is, because, of, plenary, verbal, inspiration, the, direct, immediate, word, of, god, the, apology, of, the, augsburg, confession, identifies, holy, scripture, with, the, word, of, god, and, calls, the, holy, spirit, the, author, of, the, bible, because, of, this, lutherans, confess, in, the, formula, of, concord, we, receive, and, embrace, with, our, whole, heart, the, prophetic, and, apostolic, scriptures, of, the, old, and, new, testaments, as, the, pure, clear, fountain, of, israel, the, prophetic, and, apostolic, scriptures, are, confessed, as, authentic, and, written, by, the, prophets, and, apostles, a, correct, translation, of, their, writings, is, seen, as, god, s, word, because, it, has, the, same, meaning, as, the, original, hebrew, and, greek, a, mistranslation, is, not, god, s, word, and, no, human, authority, can, invest, it, with, divine, authority, historically, lutherans, understand, the, bible, to, present, all, doctrines, and, commands, of, the, christian, faith, clearly, in, addition, lutherans, believe, that, god, s, word, is, freely, accessible, to, every, reader, or, hearer, of, ordinary, intelligence, without, requiring, any, special, education, a, lutheran, must, understand, the, language, that, scriptures, are, presented, in, and, should, not, be, so, preoccupied, by, error, so, as, to, prevent, understanding, as, a, result, of, this, lutherans, do, not, believe, there, is, a, need, to, wait, for, any, clergy, pope, scholar, or, ecumenical, council, to, explain, the, real, meaning, of, any, part, of, the, bible, lutherans, confess, that, scripture, is, united, with, the, power, of, the, holy, spirit, and, with, it, not, only, demands, but, also, creates, the, acceptance, of, its, teaching, this, teaching, produces, faith, and, obedience, holy, scripture, is, not, a, dead, letter, but, rather, the, power, of, the, holy, spirit, is, inherent, in, it, scripture, does, not, compel, a, mere, intellectual, assent, to, its, doctrine, resting, on, logical, argumentation, but, rather, it, creates, the, living, agreement, of, faith, as, the, smalcald, articles, affirm, in, those, things, which, concern, the, spoken, outward, word, we, must, firmly, hold, that, god, grants, his, spirit, or, grace, to, no, one, except, through, or, with, the, preceding, outward, word, lutherans, are, confident, that, the, bible, contains, everything, that, one, needs, to, know, in, order, to, obtain, salvation, and, to, live, a, christian, life, there, are, no, deficiencies, in, scripture, that, need, to, be, filled, with, by, tradition, pronouncements, of, the, pope, new, revelations, or, present, day, development, of, doctrine, lutherans, understand, the, bible, as, containing, two, distinct, types, of, content, termed, law, and, gospel, or, law, and, promises, properly, distinguishing, between, law, and, gospel, prevents, the, obscuring, of, the, gospel, teaching, of, justification, by, grace, through, faith, alone, the, book, of, concord, published, in, 1580, contains, 10, documents, which, some, lutherans, believe, are, faithful, and, authoritative, explanations, of, holy, scripture, besides, the, three, ecumenical, creeds, which, date, to, roman, times, the, book, of, concord, contains, seven, credal, documents, articulating, lutheran, theology, in, the, reformation, era, the, doctrinal, positions, of, lutheran, churches, are, not, uniform, because, the, book, of, concord, does, not, hold, the, same, position, in, all, lutheran, churches, for, example, the, state, churches, in, scandinavia, consider, only, the, augsburg, confession, as, a, summary, of, the, faith, in, addition, to, the, three, ecumenical, creeds, lutheran, pastors, congregations, and, church, bodies, in, germany, and, the, americas, usually, agree, to, teach, in, harmony, with, the, entire, lutheran, confessions, some, lutheran, church, bodies, require, this, pledge, to, be, unconditional, because, they, believe, the, confessions, correctly, state, what, the, bible, teaches, others, allow, their, congregations, to, do, so, insofar, as, the, confessions, are, in, agreement, with, the, bible, in, addition, lutherans, accept, the, teachings, of, the, first, seven, ecumenical, councils, of, the, christian, church, the, lutheran, church, traditionally, sees, itself, as, the, main, trunk, of, the, historical, christian, tree, founded, by, christ, and, the, apostles, holding, that, during, the, reformation, the, church, of, rome, fell, away, as, such, the, augsburg, confession, teaches, that, the, faith, as, confessed, by, luther, and, his, followers, is, nothing, new, but, the, true, catholic, faith, and, that, their, churches, represent, the, true, catholic, or, universal, church, when, the, lutherans, presented, the, augsburg, confession, to, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, they, explained, that, each, article, of, faith, and, practice, was, true, first, of, all, to, holy, scripture, and, then, also, to, the, teaching, of, the, church, fathers, and, the, councils, the, key, doctrine, or, material, principle, of, lutheranism, is, the, doctrine, of, justification, lutherans, believe, that, humans, are, saved, from, their, sins, by, god, s, grace, alone, sola, gratia, through, faith, alone, sola, fide, on, the, basis, of, scripture, alone, sola, scriptura, orthodox, lutheran, theology, holds, that, god, made, the, world, including, humanity, perfect, holy, and, sinless, however, adam, and, eve, chose, to, disobey, god, trusting, in, their, own, strength, knowledge, and, wisdom, consequently, people, are, saddled, with, original, sin, born, sinful, and, unable, to, avoid, committing, sinful, acts, for, lutherans, original, sin, is, the, chief, sin, a, root, and, fountainhead, of, all, actual, sins, lutherans, teach, that, sinners, while, capable, of, doing, works, that, are, outwardly, good, are, not, capable, of, doing, works, that, satisfy, god, s, justice, every, human, thought, and, deed, is, infected, with, sin, and, sinful, motives, because, of, this, all, humanity, deserves, eternal, damnation, in, hell, god, in, eternity, has, turned, his, fatherly, heart, to, this, world, and, planned, for, its, redemption, because, he, loves, all, people, and, does, not, want, anyone, to, be, eternally, damned, to, this, end, god, sent, his, son, jesus, christ, our, lord, into, the, world, to, redeem, and, deliver, us, from, the, power, of, the, devil, and, to, bring, us, to, himself, and, to, govern, us, as, a, king, of, righteousness, life, and, salvation, against, sin, death, and, an, evil, conscience, as, luther, s, large, catechism, explains, because, of, this, lutherans, teach, that, salvation, is, possible, only, because, of, the, grace, of, god, made, manifest, in, the, birth, life, suffering, death, resurrection, and, continuing, presence, by, the, power, of, the, holy, spirit, of, jesus, christ, by, god, s, grace, made, known, and, effective, in, the, person, and, work, of, jesus, christ, a, person, is, forgiven, adopted, as, a, child, and, heir, of, god, and, given, eternal, salvation, christ, because, he, was, entirely, obedient, to, the, law, with, respect, to, both, his, human, and, divine, natures, is, a, perfect, satisfaction, and, reconciliation, of, the, human, race, as, the, formula, of, concord, asserts, and, proceeds, to, summarize, submitted, to, the, law, for, us, bore, our, sin, and, in, going, to, his, father, performed, complete, and, perfect, obedience, for, us, poor, sinners, from, his, holy, birth, to, his, death, thereby, he, covered, all, our, disobedience, which, is, embedded, in, our, nature, and, in, its, thoughts, words, and, deeds, so, that, this, disobedience, is, not, reckoned, to, us, as, condemnation, but, is, pardoned, and, forgiven, by, sheer, grace, because, of, christ, alone, lutherans, believe, that, individuals, receive, this, gift, of, salvation, through, faith, alone, saving, faith, is, the, knowledge, of, acceptance, of, and, trust, in, the, promise, of, the, gospel, even, faith, itself, is, seen, as, a, gift, of, god, created, in, the, hearts, of, christians, by, the, work, of, the, holy, spirit, through, the, word, and, baptism, faith, receives, the, gift, of, salvation, rather, than, causes, salvation, thus, lutherans, reject, the, decision, theology, which, is, common, among, modern, evangelicals, since, the, term, grace, has, been, defined, differently, by, other, christian, church, bodies, lutheranism, defines, grace, as, entirely, limited, to, god, s, gifts, to, us, which, is, bestowed, as, pure, gift, not, something, we, merit, by, behavior, or, acts, to, lutherans, grace, is, not, about, our, response, to, god, s, gifts, but, only, his, gifts, lutherans, believe, in, the, trinity, rejecting, the, idea, that, the, father, and, god, the, son, are, merely, faces, of, the, same, person, stating, that, both, the, old, testament, and, the, new, testament, show, them, to, be, two, distinct, persons, lutherans, believe, the, holy, spirit, proceeds, from, both, the, father, and, the, son, in, the, words, of, the, athanasian, creed, we, worship, one, god, in, trinity, and, trinity, in, unity, neither, confounding, the, persons, nor, dividing, the, substance, for, there, is, one, person, of, the, father, another, of, the, son, and, another, of, the, holy, ghost, but, the, godhead, of, the, father, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, ghost, is, all, one, the, glory, equal, the, majesty, coeternal, lutherans, believe, jesus, is, the, christ, the, savior, promised, in, the, old, testament, they, believe, he, is, both, by, nature, god, and, by, nature, man, in, one, person, as, they, confess, in, luther, s, small, catechism, that, he, is, true, god, begotten, of, the, father, from, eternity, and, also, true, man, born, of, the, virgin, mary, the, augsburg, confession, explains, he, son, of, god, did, assume, the, human, nature, in, the, womb, of, the, blessed, virgin, mary, so, that, there, are, two, natures, the, divine, and, the, human, inseparably, enjoined, in, one, person, one, christ, true, god, and, true, man, who, was, born, of, the, virgin, mary, truly, suffered, was, crucified, dead, and, buried, that, he, might, reconcile, the, father, unto, us, and, be, a, sacrifice, not, only, for, original, guilt, but, also, for, all, actual, sins, of, men, lutherans, hold, that, sacraments, are, sacred, acts, of, divine, institution, whenever, they, are, properly, administered, by, the, use, of, the, physical, component, commanded, by, god, along, with, the, divine, words, of, institution, god, is, in, a, way, specific, to, each, sacrament, present, with, the, word, and, physical, component, he, earnestly, offers, to, all, who, receive, the, sacrament, forgiveness, of, sins, and, eternal, salvation, he, also, works, in, the, recipients, to, get, them, to, accept, these, blessings, and, to, increase, the, assurance, of, their, possession, lutherans, are, not, dogmatic, about, the, number, of, the, sacraments, in, line, with, luther, s, initial, statement, in, his, large, catechism, some, speak, of, only, two, sacraments, baptism, and, holy, communion, although, later, in, the, same, work, he, calls, confession, and, absolution, the, third, sacrament, the, definition, of, sacrament, in, the, apology, of, the, augsburg, confession, lists, absolution, as, one, of, them, private, confession, is, expected, before, receiving, the, eucharist, for, the, first, time, some, churches, also, allow, for, individual, absolution, on, saturdays, before, the, eucharistic, service, a, general, confession, and, absolution, known, as, the, penitential, rite, is, proclaimed, in, the, eucharistic, liturgy, lutherans, hold, that, baptism, is, a, saving, work, of, god, mandated, and, instituted, by, jesus, christ, baptism, is, a, means, of, grace, through, which, god, creates, and, strengthens, saving, faith, as, the, washing, of, regeneration, in, which, infants, and, adults, are, reborn, since, the, creation, of, faith, is, exclusively, god, s, work, it, does, not, depend, on, the, actions, of, the, one, baptized, whether, infant, or, adult, even, though, baptized, infants, cannot, articulate, that, faith, lutherans, believe, that, it, is, present, all, the, same, it, is, faith, alone, that, receives, these, divine, gifts, so, lutherans, confess, that, baptism, works, forgiveness, of, sins, delivers, from, death, and, the, devil, and, gives, eternal, salvation, to, all, who, believe, this, as, the, words, and, promises, of, god, declare, lutherans, hold, fast, to, the, scripture, cited, in, 1, peter, 3, 21, baptism, which, corresponds, to, this, now, saves, you, not, as, a, removal, of, dirt, from, the, body, but, as, an, appeal, to, god, for, a, good, conscience, through, the, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, therefore, lutherans, administer, baptism, to, both, infants, and, adults, in, the, special, section, on, infant, baptism, in, his, large, catechism, luther, argues, that, infant, baptism, is, god, pleasing, because, persons, so, baptized, were, reborn, and, sanctified, by, the, holy, spirit, lutherans, hold, that, within, the, eucharist, also, referred, to, as, the, sacrament, of, the, altar, or, the, lord, s, supper, the, true, body, and, blood, of, christ, are, truly, present, in, with, and, under, the, forms, of, the, consecrated, bread, and, wine, for, all, those, who, eat, and, drink, it, a, doctrine, that, the, formula, of, concord, calls, the, sacramental, union, many, lutherans, receive, the, sacrament, of, penance, before, receiving, the, eucharist, prior, to, going, to, confessing, and, receiving, absolution, the, faithful, are, expected, to, examine, their, lives, in, light, of, the, ten, commandments, an, order, of, confession, and, absolution, is, contained, in, the, small, catechism, as, well, as, in, liturgical, books, lutherans, typically, kneel, at, the, communion, rails, to, confess, their, sins, while, the, confessor, listens, and, then, offers, absolution, while, laying, their, stole, on, the, penitent, s, head, clergy, are, prohibited, from, revealing, anything, said, during, private, confession, and, absolution, per, the, seal, of, the, confessional, and, face, excommunication, if, it, is, violated, apart, from, this, laestadian, lutherans, have, a, practice, of, lay, confession, in, lutheranism, conversion, or, regeneration, in, the, strict, sense, of, the, term, is, the, work, of, divine, grace, and, power, by, which, man, born, of, the, flesh, and, void, of, all, power, to, think, to, will, or, to, do, any, good, thing, and, dead, in, sin, is, through, the, gospel, and, holy, baptism, taken, from, a, state, of, sin, and, spiritual, death, under, god, s, wrath, into, a, state, of, spiritual, life, of, faith, and, grace, rendered, able, to, will, and, to, do, what, is, spiritually, good, and, especially, made, to, trust, in, the, benefits, of, the, redemption, which, is, in, christ, jesus, during, conversion, one, is, moved, from, impenitence, to, repentance, the, augsburg, confession, divides, repentance, into, two, parts, one, is, contrition, that, is, terrors, smiting, the, conscience, through, the, knowledge, of, sin, the, other, is, faith, which, is, born, of, the, gospel, or, of, absolution, and, believes, that, for, christ, s, sake, sins, are, forgiven, comforts, the, conscience, and, delivers, it, from, terrors, lutherans, adhere, to, divine, monergism, the, teaching, that, salvation, is, by, god, s, act, alone, and, therefore, reject, the, idea, that, humans, in, their, fallen, state, have, a, free, will, concerning, spiritual, matters, lutherans, believe, that, although, humans, have, free, will, concerning, civil, righteousness, they, cannot, work, spiritual, righteousness, in, the, heart, without, the, presence, and, aid, of, the, holy, spirit, lutherans, believe, christians, are, saved, that, all, who, trust, in, christ, alone, and, his, promises, can, be, certain, of, their, salvation, according, to, lutheranism, the, central, final, hope, of, the, christian, is, the, resurrection, of, the, body, and, the, life, everlasting, as, confessed, in, the, apostles, creed, rather, than, predestination, lutherans, disagree, with, those, who, make, predestination, rather, than, christ, s, suffering, death, and, resurrection, the, source, of, salvation, unlike, some, calvinists, lutherans, do, not, believe, in, a, predestination, to, damnation, usually, referencing, god, our, savior, who, desires, all, people, to, be, saved, and, to, come, to, the, knowledge, of, the, truth, as, contrary, evidence, to, such, a, claim, instead, lutherans, teach, eternal, damnation, is, a, result, of, the, unbeliever, s, sins, rejection, of, the, forgiveness, of, sins, and, unbelief, according, to, lutherans, god, preserves, his, creation, cooperates, with, everything, that, happens, and, guides, the, universe, while, god, cooperates, with, both, good, and, evil, deeds, with, evil, deeds, he, does, so, only, inasmuch, as, they, are, deeds, but, not, with, the, evil, in, them, god, concurs, with, an, act, s, effect, but, he, does, not, cooperate, in, the, corruption, of, an, act, or, the, evil, of, its, effect, lutherans, believe, everything, exists, for, the, sake, of, the, christian, church, and, that, god, guides, everything, for, its, welfare, and, growth, the, explanation, of, the, apostles, creed, given, in, the, small, catechism, declares, that, everything, good, that, people, have, is, given, and, preserved, by, god, either, directly, or, through, other, people, or, things, of, the, services, others, provide, us, through, family, government, and, work, we, receive, these, blessings, not, from, them, but, through, them, from, god, since, god, uses, everyone, s, useful, tasks, for, good, people, should, not, look, down, upon, some, useful, vocations, as, being, less, worthy, than, others, instead, people, should, honor, others, no, matter, how, lowly, as, being, the, means, god, uses, to, work, in, the, world, lutherans, believe, that, augsburg, confession, s, article, xx, of, good, works, are, the, fruit, of, faith, always, and, in, every, instance, good, works, have, their, origin, in, god, not, in, the, fallen, human, heart, or, in, human, striving, their, absence, would, demonstrate, that, faith, too, is, absent, lutherans, do, not, believe, that, good, works, are, a, factor, in, obtaining, salvation, they, believe, that, we, are, saved, by, the, grace, of, god, based, on, the, merit, of, christ, in, his, suffering, and, death, and, faith, in, the, triune, god, good, works, are, the, natural, result, of, faith, not, the, cause, of, salvation, although, christians, are, no, longer, compelled, to, keep, god, s, law, they, freely, and, willingly, serve, god, and, their, neighbors, lutherans, do, not, believe, in, any, sort, of, earthly, millennial, kingdom, of, christ, either, before, or, after, his, second, coming, on, the, last, day, lutherans, teach, that, at, death, the, souls, of, christians, are, immediately, taken, into, the, presence, of, jesus, where, they, await, the, second, coming, of, jesus, on, the, last, day, on, the, last, day, all, the, bodies, of, the, dead, will, be, resurrected, their, souls, will, then, be, reunited, with, the, same, bodies, they, had, before, dying, the, bodies, will, then, be, changed, those, of, the, wicked, to, a, state, of, everlasting, shame, and, torment, those, of, the, righteous, to, an, everlasting, state, of, celestial, glory, after, the, resurrection, of, all, the, dead, and, the, change, of, those, still, living, all, nations, shall, be, gathered, before, christ, and, he, will, separate, the, righteous, from, the, wicked, christ, will, publicly, judge, all, people, by, the, testimony, of, their, deeds, the, good, works, of, the, righteous, in, evidence, of, their, faith, and, the, evil, works, of, the, wicked, in, evidence, of, their, unbelief, he, will, judge, in, righteousness, in, the, presence, of, all, people, and, angels, and, his, final, judgment, will, be, just, damnation, to, everlasting, punishment, for, the, wicked, and, a, gracious, gift, of, life, everlasting, to, the, righteous, lutherans, place, great, emphasis, on, a, liturgical, approach, to, worship, services, although, there, are, substantial, non, liturgical, minorities, for, example, the, haugean, lutherans, from, norway, martin, luther, was, a, great, proponent, of, music, and, this, is, why, music, forms, a, central, part, of, lutheran, services, to, this, day, in, particular, luther, admired, the, composers, josquin, des, prez, and, ludwig, senfl, and, wanted, singing, in, the, church, to, move, away, from, the, ars, perfecta, catholic, sacred, music, of, the, late, renaissance, and, towards, singing, as, a, gemeinschaft, community, lutheran, hymns, are, sometimes, known, as, chorales, lutheran, hymnody, is, well, known, for, its, doctrinal, didactic, and, musical, richness, most, lutheran, churches, are, active, musically, with, choirs, handbell, choirs, children, s, choirs, and, occasionally, change, ringing, groups, that, ring, bells, in, a, bell, tower, johann, sebastian, bach, a, devout, lutheran, composed, a, huge, body, of, sacred, music, for, the, lutheran, church, lutherans, also, preserve, a, liturgical, approach, to, the, celebration, of, the, holy, eucharist, communion, emphasizing, the, sacrament, as, the, central, act, of, christian, worship, lutherans, believe, that, the, actual, body, and, blood, of, jesus, christ, are, present, in, with, and, under, the, bread, and, the, wine, this, belief, is, called, real, presence, or, sacramental, union, and, is, different, from, consubstantiation, and, transubstantiation, additionally, lutherans, reject, the, idea, that, communion, is, a, mere, symbol, or, memorial, they, confess, in, the, apology, of, the, augsburg, confession, e, do, not, abolish, the, mass, but, religiously, keep, and, defend, it, among, us, the, mass, is, celebrated, every, lord, s, day, and, on, other, festivals, when, the, sacrament, is, made, available, to, those, who, wish, to, partake, of, it, after, they, have, been, examined, and, absolved, we, also, keep, traditional, liturgical, forms, such, as, the, order, of, readings, prayers, vestments, and, other, similar, things, in, addition, to, the, holy, communion, divine, service, congregations, frequently, also, hold, offices, which, are, worship, services, without, communion, they, may, include, matins, vespers, compline, or, other, observances, of, the, daily, office, private, or, family, offices, include, the, morning, and, evening, prayers, from, luther, s, small, catechism, meals, are, blessed, with, the, common, table, prayer, psalm, 145, 15, 16, or, other, prayers, and, after, eating, the, lord, is, thanked, for, example, with, psalm, 136, 1, luther, himself, encouraged, the, use, of, psalm, verses, such, as, those, already, mentioned, along, with, the, lord, s, prayer, and, another, short, prayer, before, and, after, each, meal, blessing, and, thanks, at, meals, from, luther, s, small, catechism, in, addition, lutherans, use, devotional, books, from, small, daily, devotionals, for, example, portals, of, prayer, to, large, breviaries, including, the, breviarium, lipsiensae, and, treasury, of, daily, prayer, the, predominant, rite, used, by, lutheran, churches, is, a, western, one, based, on, the, formula, missae, form, of, the, mass, although, other, lutheran, liturgies, are, also, in, use, such, as, those, used, in, the, byzantine, rite, lutheran, churches, such, as, the, ukrainian, lutheran, church, and, evangelical, church, of, the, augsburg, confession, in, slovenia, although, luther, s, deutsche, messe, was, completely, chanted, except, for, the, sermon, this, is, less, common, today, in, the, 1970s, many, lutheran, churches, began, holding, contemporary, worship, services, for, the, purpose, of, evangelistic, outreach, these, services, were, in, a, variety, of, styles, depending, on, the, preferences, of, the, congregation, often, they, were, held, alongside, a, traditional, service, in, order, to, cater, to, those, who, preferred, contemporary, worship, music, today, a, few, lutheran, congregations, have, contemporary, worship, as, their, sole, form, of, worship, outreach, is, no, longer, given, as, the, primary, motivation, rather, this, form, of, worship, is, seen, as, more, in, keeping, with, the, desires, of, individual, congregations, in, finland, lutherans, have, experimented, with, the, st, thomas, mass, and, metal, mass, in, which, traditional, hymns, are, adapted, to, heavy, metal, some, laestadians, enter, a, heavily, emotional, and, ecstatic, state, during, worship, the, lutheran, world, federation, in, its, nairobi, statement, on, worship, and, culture, recommended, every, effort, be, made, to, bring, church, services, into, a, more, sensitive, position, with, regard, to, cultural, context, in, 2006, both, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in,

china, including, those, of, the, lutheran, church, of, china, were, expelled, they, began, ministry, in, taiwan, and, hong, kong, the, latter, which, became, a, center, of, lutheranism, in, asia, the, lutheran, mission, in, new, guinea, though, founded, only, in, 1953, became, the, largest, lutheran, mission, in, the, world, in, only, several, decades, through, the, work, of, native, lay,

abuses, of, the, pre, reformation, church, will, not, recur, lutheran, schools, have, always, been, a, core, aspect, of, lutheran, mission, work, starting, with, bartholomew, ziegenbalg, and, heinrich, putschasu, who, began, work, in, india, in, year, 1706, during, the, counter, reformation, era, in, german, speaking, areas, backstreet, lutheran, schools, were, the, main, lutheran, institution, among, crypto, lutherans, pastors, almost, always, have, substantial, theological, educations, including, koine, greek, and, biblical, hebrew, so, that, they, can, refer, to, the, christian, scriptures, in, the, original, language, pastors, usually, teach, in, the, common, language, of, the, local, congregation, in, the, u, s, some, congregations, and, synods, historically, taught, in, german, danish, finnish, norwegian, or, swedish, but, retention, of, immigrant, languages, has, been, in, significant, decline, since, the, early, and, middle, 20th, century, lutherans, were, divided, about, the, issue, of, church, fellowship, for, the, first, 30, years, after, luther, s, death, philipp, melanchthon, and, his, philippist, party, felt, that, christians, of, different, beliefs, should, join, in, union, with, each, other, without, completely, agreeing, on, doctrine, against, them, stood, the, gnesio, lutherans, led, by, matthias, flacius, and, the, faculty, at, the, university, of, jena, they, condemned, the, philippist, position, for, indifferentism, describing, it, as, a, unionistic, compromise, of, precious, reformation, theology, instead, they, held, that, genuine, unity, between, christians, and, real, theological, peace, was, only, possible, with, an, honest, agreement, about, every, subject, of, doctrinal, controversy, complete, agreement, finally, came, about, in, 1577, after, the, death, of, both, melanchthon, and, flacius, when, a, new, generation, of, theologians, resolved, the, doctrinal, controversies, on, the, basis, of, scripture, in, the, formula, of, concord, of, 1577, although, they, decried, the, visible, division, of, christians, on, earth, orthodox, lutherans, avoided, ecumenical, fellowship, with, other, churches, believing, that, christians, should, not, for, example, join, for, the, lord, s, supper, or, exchange, pastors, if, they, do, not, completely, agree, about, what, the, bible, teaches, in, the, 17th, century, georgius, calixtus, began, a, rebellion, against, this, practice, sparking, the, syncretistic, controversy, with, abraham, calovius, as, his, main, opponent, in, the, 18th, century, there, was, some, ecumenical, interest, between, the, church, of, sweden, and, the, church, of, england, john, robinson, bishop, of, london, planned, for, a, union, of, the, english, and, swedish, churches, in, 1718, the, plan, failed, because, most, swedish, bishops, rejected, the, calvinism, of, the, church, of, england, although, jesper, swedberg, and, johannes, gezelius, the, younger, bishops, of, skara, sweden, and, turku, finland, were, in, favor, with, the, encouragement, of, swedberg, church, fellowship, was, established, between, swedish, lutherans, and, anglicans, in, the, middle, colonies, over, the, course, of, the, 1700s, and, the, early, 1800s, swedish, lutherans, were, absorbed, into, anglican, churches, with, the, last, original, swedish, congregation, completing, merger, into, the, episcopal, church, in, 1846, in, the, 19th, century, samuel, simon, schmucker, attempted, to, lead, the, evangelical, lutheran, general, synod, of, the, united, states, toward, unification, with, other, american, protestants, his, attempt, to, get, the, synod, to, reject, the, augsburg, confession, in, favor, of, his, compromising, definite, platform, failed, instead, it, sparked, a, neo, lutheran, revival, prompting, many, to, form, the, general, council, including, charles, porterfield, krauth, their, alternative, approach, was, lutheran, pulpits, for, lutheran, ministers, only, and, lutheran, altars, for, lutheran, communicants, only, beginning, in, 1867, confessional, and, liberal, minded, lutherans, in, germany, joined, to, form, the, common, evangelical, lutheran, conference, against, the, ever, looming, prospect, of, a, state, mandated, union, with, the, reformed, however, they, failed, to, reach, consensus, on, the, degree, of, shared, doctrine, necessary, for, church, union, eventually, the, fascist, german, christians, movement, pushed, the, final, national, merger, of, lutheran, union, and, reformed, church, bodies, into, a, single, reich, church, in, 1933, doing, away, with, the, previous, umbrella, german, evangelical, church, confederation, dek, as, part, of, denazification, the, reich, church, was, formally, done, away, with, in, 1945, and, certain, clergy, were, removed, from, their, positions, however, the, merger, between, the, lutheran, united, and, reformed, state, churches, was, retained, under, the, name, protestant, church, in, germany, evangelische, kirche, in, deutschland, ekd, in, 1948, the, lutheran, church, bodies, within, the, ekd, founded, the, united, evangelical, lutheran, church, of, germany, velkd, but, it, has, since, been, reduced, from, being, an, independent, legal, entity, to, an, administrative, unit, within, the, ekd, lutherans, are, currently, divided, over, how, to, interact, with, other, christian, denominations, some, lutherans, assert, that, everyone, must, share, the, whole, counsel, of, god, acts, 20, 27, in, complete, unity, 1, cor, 1, 10, before, pastors, can, share, each, other, s, pulpits, and, before, communicants, commune, at, each, other, s, altars, a, practice, termed, closed, or, close, communion, on, the, other, hand, other, lutherans, practice, varying, degrees, of, open, communion, and, allow, preachers, from, other, christian, denominations, in, their, pulpits, while, not, an, issue, in, the, majority, of, lutheran, church, bodies, some, of, them, forbid, membership, in, freemasonry, partly, this, is, because, the, lodge, is, viewed, as, spreading, unitarianism, as, the, brief, statement, of, the, lcms, reads, hence, we, warn, against, unitarianism, which, in, our, country, has, to, a, great, extent, impenetrated, the, sects, and, is, being, spread, particularly, also, through, the, influence, of, the, lodges, a, 1958, report, from, the, publishing, house, of, the, wisconsin, evangelical, lutheran, synod, states, that, masonry, is, guilty, of, idolatry, its, worship, and, prayers, are, idol, worship, the, masons, may, not, with, their, hands, have, made, an, idol, out, of, gold, silver, wood, or, stone, but, they, created, one, with, their, own, mind, and, reason, out, of, purely, human, thoughts, and, ideas, the, latter, is, an, idol, no, less, than, the, former, the, largest, organization, of, lutheran, churches, around, the, world, are, the, lutheran, world, federation, lwf, the, global, confessional, and, missional, lutheran, forum, the, international, lutheran, council, ilc, and, the, confessional, evangelical, lutheran, conference, celc, these, organizations, together, account, for, the, great, majority, of, lutheran, denominations, the, lcms, and, the, lutheran, church, canada, are, members, of, the, ilc, the, wels, and, els, are, members, of, the, celc, many, lutheran, churches, are, not, affiliated, with, the, lwf, the, ilc, or, the, celc, the, congregations, of, the, church, of, the, lutheran, confession, clc, are, affiliated, with, their, mission, organizations, in, canada, india, nepal,

world, federation, aligned, churches, do, not, believe, that, one, church, is, singularly, true, in, its, teachings, according, to, this, belief, lutheranism, is, a, reform, movement, rather, than, a, movement, into, doctrinal, correctness, as, part, of, this, in, 1999, the, lwf, and, the, roman, catholic, church, jointly, issued, a, statement, the, joint, declaration, on, the, doctrine, of, justification, that, stated, that, the, lwf, and, the, catholics, both, agreed, about, certain, basics, of, justification, and, lifted, certain, catholic, anathemas, formerly, applying, to, the, lwf, member, churches, the, lcms, has, participated, in, most, of, the, official, dialogues, with, the, roman, catholic, church, since, shortly, after, the, second, vatican, council, though, not, the, one, which, produced, the, joint, declaration, and, to, which, they, were, not, invited, while, some, lutheran, theologians, saw, the, joint, declaration, as, a, sign, that, the, catholics, were, essentially, adopting, the, lutheran, position, other, lutheran, theologians, disagreed, claiming, that, considering, the, public, documentation, of, the, catholic, position, this, assertion, does, not, hold, up, besides, their, intra, lutheran, arrangements, some, member, churches, of, the, lwf, have, also, declared, full, communion, with, non, lutheran, protestant, churches, the, porvoo, communion, is, a, communion, of, episcopally, led, lutheran, and, anglican, churches, in, europe, beside, its, membership, in, the, porvoo, communion, church, of, sweden, also, has, declared, full, communion, with, the, philippine, independent, church, and, the, united, methodist, church, the, state, protestant, churches, in, germany, many, other, european, countries, have, signed, the, leuenberg, agreement, to, form, the, community, of, protestant, churches, in, europe, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, has, been, involved, in, ecumenical, dialogues, with, several, denominations, the, elca, has, declared, full, communion, with, multiple, american, protestant, churches, although, on, paper, the, lwf, churches, have, all, declared, have, full, communion, with, each, other, in, practice, some, churches, within, the, lwf, have, renounced, ties, with, specific, other, churches, one, development, in, this, ongoing, schism, is, the, global, confessional, and, missional, lutheran, forum, which, consists, of, churches, and, church, related, organizations, tracing, their, heritage, back, to, mainline, american, lutheranism, in, north, america, european, state, churches, as, well, as, certain, african, churches, as, of, 2019, the, forum, is, not, a, full, communion, organization, similar, in, this, structure, is, the, international, lutheran, council, where, issues, of, communion, are, left, to, the, individual, denominations, not, all, ilc, churches, have, declared, church, fellowship, with, each, other, in, contrast, mutual, church, fellowship, is, part, of, the, celc, member, churches, and, unlike, in, the, lwf, this, is, not, contradicted, by, individual, statements, from, any, particular, member, church, body, laestadians, within, certain, european, state, churches, maintain, close, ties, to, other, laestadians, often, called, apostolic, lutherans, altogether, laestadians, are, found, in, 23, countries, across, five, continents, but, there, is, no, single, organization, which, represents, them, laestadians, operate, peace, associations, to, coordinate, their, churchly, efforts, nearly, all, are, located, in, europe, although, they, there, are, 15, combined, in, north, america, ecuador, togo, and, kenya, by, contrast, the, confessional, evangelical, lutheran, conference, and, international, lutheran, council, as, well, as, some, unaffiliated, denominations, such, as, the, church, of, the, lutheran, confession, and, north, american, laestadians, maintain, that, the, orthodox, confessional, lutheran, churches, are, the, only, churches, with, completely, correct, doctrine, they, teach, that, while, other, christian, churches, teach, partially, orthodox, doctrine, and, have, true, christians, as, members, the, doctrines, of, those, churches, contain, significant, errors, more, conservative, lutherans, strive, to, maintain, historical, distinctiveness, while, emphasizing, doctrinal, purity, alongside, gospel, motivated, outreach, they, claim, that, lwf, lutherans, are, practicing, fake, ecumenism, by, desiring, church, fellowship, outside, of, actual, unity, of, teaching, although, not, an, ecumenical, movement, in, the, formal, sense, in, the, 1990s, influences, from, the, megachurches, of, american, evangelicalism, have, become, somewhat, common, many, of, the, largest, lutheran, congregations, in, the, united, states, have, been, heavily, influenced, by, these, progressive, evangelicals, these, influences, are, sharply, criticized, by, some, lutherans, as, being, foreign, to, orthodox, lutheran, beliefs, lutheran, polity, varies, depending, on, influences, although, article, xiv, of, the, augsburg, confession, mandates, that, one, must, be, properly, called, to, preach, or, administer, the, sacraments, some, lutherans, have, a, broad, view, of, on, what, constitutes, this, and, thus, allow, lay, preaching, or, students, still, studying, to, be, pastors, someday, to, consecrate, the, lord, s, supper, despite, considerable, diversity, lutheran, polity, trends, in, a, geographically, predictable, manner, in, europe, with, episcopal, governance, to, the, north, and, east, but, blended, and, consistorial, presbyterian, type, synodical, governance, in, germany, to, the, north, in, scandinavia, the, population, was, more, insulated, from, the, influence, and, politics, of, the, reformation, and, thus, the, church, of, sweden, which, at, the, time, included, finland, retained, the, apostolic, succession, although, they, did, not, consider, it, essential, for, valid, sacraments, as, the, donatists, did, in, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, and, the, roman, catholics, do, today, recently, the, swedish, succession, was, introduced, into, all, of, the, porvoo, communion, churches, all, of, which, have, an, episcopal, polity, although, the, lutheran, churches, did, not, require, this, or, change, their, doctrine, this, was, important, in, order, for, more, strictly, high, church, anglican, individuals, to, feel, comfortable, recognizing, their, sacraments, as, valid, the, occasional, ordination, of, a, bishop, by, a, priest, was, not, necessarily, considered, an, invalid, ordination, in, the, middle, ages, so, the, alleged, break, in, the, line, of, succession, in, the, other, nordic, churches, would, have, been, considered, a, violation, of, canon, law, rather, than, an, invalid, ordination, at, the, time, moreover, there, are, no, consistent, records, detailing, pre, reformation, ordinations, prior, to, the, 12th, century, in, the, far, north, of, the, scandinavian, peninsula, are, the, s, mi, people, some, of, which, practice, a, form, of, lutheranism, called, apostolic, lutheranism, or, laestadianism, due, to, the, efforts, of, lars, levi, laestadius, however, others, are, orthodox, in, religion, some, apostolic, lutherans, consider, their, movement, as, part, of, an, unbroken, line, down, from, the, apostles, in, areas, where, apostolic, lutherans, have, their, own, bishops, apart, from, other, lutheran, church, organizations, the, bishops, wield, more, practical, authority, than, lutheran, clergy, typically, do, in, russia, laestadians, of, lutheran, background, cooperate, with, the, ingrian, church, but, since, laestadianism, is, an, interdenominational, movement, some, are, eastern, orthodox, eastern, orthodox, laestadians, are, known, as, ushkovayzet, article, is, in, russian, although, historically, pietism, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, understanding, of, the, ministry, among, lutherans, in, the, russian, empire, today, nearly, all, russian, and, ukrainian, lutherans, are, influenced, by, eastern, orthodox, polity, in, their, culture, giving, a, high, degree, of, respect, and, authority, to, their, bishops, is, necessary, for, their, faith, to, be, seen, as, legitimate, and, not, sectarian, in, russia, lines, of, succession, between, bishops, and, the, canonical, authority, between, their, present, day, hierarchy, is, also, carefully, maintained, in, order, to, legitimize, the, existing, lutheran, churches, as, present, day, successors, of, the, former, lutheran, church, of, the, russian, empire, originally, authorized, by, catherine, the, great, this, allows, for, the, post, soviet, repatriation, of, lutheran, church, buildings, to, local, congregations, on, the, basis, of, this, historical, connection, in, germany, several, dynamics, encouraged, lutherans, to, maintain, a, different, form, of, polity, first, due, to, de, facto, practice, during, the, nuremberg, religious, peace, the, subsequent, legal, principal, of, cuius, regio, eius, religio, in, the, 1555, peace, of, augsburg, german, states, were, officially, either, catholic, or, evangelical, that, is, lutheran, under, the, augsburg, confession, in, some, areas, both, catholic, and, lutheran, churches, were, permitted, to, co, exist, because, german, speaking, catholic, areas, were, nearby, catholic, leaning, christians, were, able, to, emigrate, and, there, was, less, of, an, issue, with, catholics, choosing, to, live, as, crypto, papists, in, lutheran, areas, although, reformed, leaning, christians, were, not, allowed, to, have, churches, melancthon, wrote, augsburg, confession, variata, which, some, used, to, claim, legal, protection, as, evangelical, churches, many, chose, to, live, as, crypto, calvinists, either, with, or, without, the, protection, offered, by, the, variata, but, this, did, not, make, their, influence, go, away, and, as, a, result, the, protestant, church, in, germany, as, of, 2017, was, only, about, 40, lutheran, with, most, of, the, rest, being, united, protestant, a, combination, of, lutheran, and, reformed, beliefs, and, practices, in, terms, of, polity, over, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, carefully, negotiated, and, highly, prescriptive, church, orders, of, the, reformation, era, gave, way, to, a, joint, cooperation, between, state, control, and, a, reformed, style, blend, of, consistorial, and, presbyterian, type, synodical, governance, just, as, negotiations, over, the, details, in, the, church, orders, involved, the, laity, so, did, the, new, synodical, governance, synodical, governance, had, already, been, practiced, in, the, reformed, netherlands, prior, to, its, adoption, by, lutherans, during, the, formation, of, the, modern, german, state, ideas, about, the, nature, of, authority, and, the, best, design, for, governments, and, organizations, came, from, the, philosophies, of, kant, and, hegel, further, modifying, the, polity, when, the, monarchy, and, the, sovereign, governance, of, the, church, were, ended, in, 1918, the, synods, took, over, the, governance, of, the, state, churches, during, the, period, of, the, emigration, lutherans, took, their, existing, ideas, about, polity, with, them, across, the, ocean, though, with, the, exception, of, the, early, swedish, lutherans, immigrants, of, the, new, sweden, colony, who, accepted, the, rule, of, the, anglican, bishops, and, became, part, of, the, established, church, they, now, had, to, fund, churches, on, their, own, this, increased, the, congregationalist, dynamic, in, the, blended, consistorial, and, presbyterian, type, synodical, governance, the, first, organized, church, body, of, lutherans, in, america, was, the, pennsylvania, ministerium, which, used, reformed, style, synodical, governance, over, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, their, contribution, to, the, development, of, polity, was, that, smaller, synods, could, in, turn, form, a, larger, body, also, with, synodical, governance, but, without, losing, their, lower, level, of, governance, as, a, result, the, smaller, synods, gained, unprecedented, flexibility, to, join, leave, merge, or, stay, separate, all, without, the, hand, of, the, state, as, had, been, the, case, in, europe, during, their, 19th, century, persecution, old, lutheran, defined, as, scholastic, and, orthodox, believers, were, left, in, a, conundrum, resistance, to, authority, was, traditionally, considered, disobedience, but, under, the, circumstances, upholding, orthodox, doctrine, and, historical, practice, was, considered, by, the, government, disobedience, however, the, doctrine, of, the, lesser, magistrate, allowed, clergy, to, legitimately, resist, the, state, and, even, leave, illegal, free, churches, were, set, up, in, germany, and, mass, emigration, occurred, for, decades, the, new, churches, were, mostly, dependent, on, the, free, churches, to, send, them, new, ministerial, candidates, for, ordination, these, new, church, bodies, also, employed, synodical, governance, but, tended, to, exclude, hegelianism, in, their, constitutions, due, to, its, incompatibility, with, the, doctrine, of, the, lesser, magistrates, in, contrast, to, hegelianism, where, authority, flows, in, from, all, levels, kantianism, presents, authority, proceeding, only, from, the, top, down, hence, the, need, for, a, lesser, magistrate, to, become, the, new, top, magistrate, over, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, some, lutheran, bodies, have, adopted, a, more, congregationalist, approach, such, as, the, protes, tant, conference, and, the, lutheran, congregations, in, mission, for, christ, or, lcmc, the, lcmc, formed, due, to, a, church, split, after, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, signed, an, agreement, with, the, episcopal, church, to, start, ordaining, all, of, their, new, bishops, into, the, episcopalian, apostolic, succession, in, other, words, this, meant, that, new, elca, bishops, at, least, at, first, would, be, jointly, ordained, by, anglican, bishops, as, well, as, lutheran, bishops, so, that, the, more, strict, episcopalians, i, e, anglo, catholics, would, recognize, their, sacraments, as, valid, this, was, offensive, to, some, in, the, elca, at, the, time, because, of, the, implications, this, practice, would, have, on, the, teachings, of, the, priesthood, of, all, believers, and, the, nature, of, ordination, some, lutheran, churches, permit, dual, rostering, situations, like, this, one, where, a, church, or, church, body, belongs, to, multiple, larger, organizations, that, do, not, have, ties, are, termed, triangular, fellowship, another, variant, is, independent, lutheran, churches, although, for, some, independent, churches, the, clergy, are, members, of, a, larger, denomination, in, other, cases, a, congregation, may, belong, to, a, synod, but, the, pastor, may, be, unaffiliated, in, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, the, lutheran, church, of, australia, the, wisconsin, synod, the, evangelical, lutheran, synod,

the, supreme, court, in, 2012, however, differences, remain, in, the, precise, status, of, their, teachers, lutheran, churches, currently, have, millions, of, members, and, are, present, on, all, populated, continents, the, lutheran, world, federation, estimates, the, total, membership, of, its, churches, over, 77, million, this, figure, miscounts, lutherans, worldwide, as, not, all, lutheran,
