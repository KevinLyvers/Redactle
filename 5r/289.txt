vedanta, v, e, d, n, t, sanskrit, iast, ved, nta, also, known, as, uttara, m, m, s, is, one, of, the, six, orthodox, stika, traditions, of, textual, exegesis, and, hindu, philosophy, the, word, vedanta, means, conclusion, of, the, vedas, and, encompasses, the, ideas, that, emerged, from, or, aligned, and, reinterpreted, the, speculations, and, enumerations, contained, in, the, upanishads, focusing, with, varying, emphasis, on, devotion, and, knowledge, and, liberation, vedanta, developed, into, many, traditions, all, of, which, give, their, specific, interpretations, of, a, common, group, of, texts, called, the, prasth, natray, translated, as, the, three, sources, the, upanishads, the, brahma, sutras, and, the, bhagavad, gita, all, vedanta, traditions, are, exegetical, in, nature, but, also, contain, extensive, discussions, on, ontology, soteriology, and, epistemology, even, as, there, is, much, disagreement, among, the, various, traditions, independently, considered, they, may, seem, completely, disparate, due, to, the, pronounced, differences, in, thoughts, and, reasoning, the, main, traditions, of, vedanta, are, bhedabheda, difference, and, non, difference, advaita, non, dualism, and, the, vaishnavite, traditions, of, dvaitadvaita, dualistic, non, dualism, vishishtadvaita, qualified, non, dualism, tattvavada, dvaita, dualism, suddhadvaita, pure, non, dualism, and, achintya, bheda, abheda, inconceivable, difference, and, non, difference, modern, developments, in, vedanta, include, neo, vedanta, and, the, philosophy, of, the, swaminarayan, sampradaya, most, major, vedanta, schools, except, advaita, vedanta, and, neo, vedanta, are, related, to, vaishnavism, and, emphasize, devotion, bhakti, to, god, understood, as, vishnu, or, a, related, manifestation, advaita, vedanta, on, the, other, hand, emphasizes, j, ana, knowledge, and, j, ana, yoga, over, theistic, devotion, while, the, monism, of, advaita, has, attracted, considerable, attention, in, the, west, due, to, the, influence, of, the, 14th, century, advaitin, vidyaranya, and, modern, hindus, like, swami, vivekananda, and, ramana, maharshi, most, vedanta, traditions, focus, on, vaishnava, theology, the, word, vedanta, is, made, of, two, words, the, word, vedanta, literally, means, the, end, of, the, vedas, and, originally, referred, to, the, upanishads, vedanta, is, concerned, with, the, j, nak, a, or, knowledge, section, of, the, vedas, which, is, called, the, upanishads, the, meaning, of, vedanta, expanded, later, to, encompass, the, different, philosophical, traditions, that, interpret, and, explain, the, prasthanatrayi, in, the, light, of, their, respective, views, on, the, relation, between, humans, and, the, divine, or, absolute, reality, the, upanishads, may, be, regarded, as, the, end, of, vedas, in, different, senses, vedanta, is, one, of, the, six, orthodox, stika, traditions, of, textual, exegesis, and, indian, philosophy, it, is, also, called, uttara, m, m, s, which, means, the, latter, enquiry, or, higher, enquiry, and, is, often, contrasted, with, p, rva, m, m, s, the, former, enquiry, or, primary, enquiry, p, rva, m, m, s, deals, with, the, karmak, a, or, ritualistic, section, the, samhita, and, brahmanas, in, the, vedas, while, uttara, m, m, s, concerns, itself, with, the, deeper, questions, of, the, relation, between, humans, and, divine, or, absolute, reality, despite, their, differences, all, traditions, of, vedanta, share, some, common, features, the, main, upanishads, the, bhagavadg, t, and, the, brahma, s, tras, are, the, foundational, scriptures, in, vedanta, all, traditions, of, vedanta, give, a, specific, exegesis, of, these, texts, collectively, called, the, prasth, natray, literally, three, sources, all, prominent, vedantic, teachers, including, shankara, bhaskara, ramanuja, madhva, nimbarka, and, vallabha, wrote, commentaries, on, these, three, sources, the, brahma, s, tras, of, badarayana, serve, as, a, bhedabheda, based, synthesis, of, the, teachings, found, in, the, diverse, upanishads, and, while, there, may, have, been, other, similar, syntheses, in, the, past, only, the, brahma, s, tras, have, survived, to, the, present, day, the, bhagavadg, t, with, its, syncretism, of, samkhya, yoga, and, upanishadic, thought, has, also, been, a, significant, influence, on, vedantic, thought, all, ved, ntins, agree, that, scripture, ruti, is, the, only, means, of, knowing, pram, a, regarding, spiritual, matters, which, are, beyond, perception, and, inference, this, is, explained, by, r, m, nuja, as, follows, a, theory, that, rests, exclusively, on, human, concepts, may, at, some, other, time, or, place, be, refuted, by, arguments, devised, by, cleverer, people, the, conclusion, is, that, with, regard, to, supernatural, matters, scripture, alone, is, the, epistemic, authority, and, that, reasoning, is, to, be, used, only, in, support, of, scripture, for, specific, sub, traditions, of, vedanta, other, texts, may, be, equally, important, for, example, for, advaita, vedanta, the, works, of, adi, shankara, are, nominally, central, though, other, teachers, were, equally, or, even, more, influential, for, the, theistic, vaishnava, schools, of, vedanta, the, bh, gavata, pur, a, is, particularly, important, the, bh, gavata, pur, a, is, one, of, the, most, widely, commented, upon, works, in, vedanta, this, text, is, so, central, to, the, krishna, centered, vedanta, schools, that, the, vedantin, theologian, vallabha, added, the, bh, gavata, pur, a, as, a, fourth, text, to, the, prasth, natray, three, classic, scriptures, of, vedanta, vedanta, philosophies, discuss, three, fundamental, metaphysical, categories, and, the, relations, between, the, three, shankara, in, formulating, advaita, talks, of, two, conceptions, of, brahman, the, higher, brahman, as, undifferentiated, being, and, a, lower, brahman, endowed, with, qualities, as, the, creator, of, the, universe, ramanuja, in, formulating, vishishtadvaita, vedanta, rejects, nirgu, a, that, the, undifferentiated, absolute, is, inconceivable, and, adopts, a, theistic, interpretation, of, the, upanishads, accepting, brahman, as, vara, the, personal, god, who, is, the, seat, of, all, auspicious, attributes, as, the, one, reality, the, god, of, vishishtadvaita, is, accessible, to, the, devotee, yet, remains, the, absolute, with, differentiated, attributes, madhva, in, expounding, dvaita, philosophy, maintains, that, vishnu, is, the, supreme, god, thus, identifying, the, brahman, or, absolute, reality, of, the, upanishads, with, a, personal, god, as, ramanuja, had, done, before, him, nimbarka, in, his, dvaitadvata, philosophy, accepted, the, brahman, both, as, nirgu, a, and, as, sagu, a, vallabha, in, his, shuddhadvaita, philosophy, not, only, accepts, the, triple, ontological, essence, of, the, brahman, but, also, his, manifestation, as, personal, god, vara, as, matter, and, as, individual, souls, the, schools, of, vedanta, differ, in, their, conception, of, the, relation, they, see, between, tman, j, v, tman, and, brahman, vara, pram, a, sanskrit, literally, means, proof, that, which, is, the, means, of, valid, knowledge, it, refers, to, epistemology, in, indian, philosophies, and, encompasses, the, study, of, reliable, and, valid, means, by, which, human, beings, gain, accurate, true, knowledge, the, focus, of, pramana, is, the, manner, in, which, correct, knowledge, can, be, acquired, how, one, knows, or, does, not, know, and, to, what, extent, knowledge, pertinent, about, someone, or, something, can, be, acquired, ancient, and, medieval, indian, texts, identify, six, pramanas, as, correct, means, of, accurate, knowledge, and, truths, the, different, schools, of, vedanta, have, historically, disagreed, as, to, which, of, the, six, are, epistemologically, valid, for, example, while, advaita, vedanta, accepts, all, six, pramanas, vishishtadvaita, and, dvaita, accept, only, three, pramanas, perception, inference, and, testimony, advaita, considers, pratyak, a, perception, as, the, most, reliable, source, of, knowledge, and, abda, the, scriptural, evidence, is, considered, secondary, except, for, matters, related, to, brahman, where, it, is, the, only, evidence, in, vi, i, dvaita, and, dvaita, abda, the, scriptural, testimony, is, considered, the, most, authentic, means, of, knowledge, instead, all, schools, of, vedanta, subscribe, to, the, theory, of, satk, ryav, da, which, means, that, the, effect, is, pre, existent, in, the, cause, but, there, are, two, different, views, on, the, status, of, the, effect, that, is, the, world, most, schools, of, vedanta, as, well, as, samkhya, support, parinamavada, the, idea, that, the, world, is, a, real, transformation, parinama, of, brahman, according, to, nicholson, 2010, p, 27, the, brahma, sutras, espouse, the, realist, parinamavada, position, which, appears, to, have, been, the, view, most, common, among, early, vedantins, in, contrast, to, badarayana, post, shankara, advaita, vedantists, hold, a, different, view, vivartavada, which, says, that, the, effect, the, world, is, merely, an, unreal, vivarta, transformation, of, its, cause, brahman, the, upanishads, present, an, associative, philosophical, inquiry, in, the, form, of, identifying, various, doctrines, and, then, presenting, arguments, for, or, against, them, they, form, the, basic, texts, and, vedanta, interprets, them, through, rigorous, philosophical, exegesis, to, defend, the, point, of, view, of, their, specific, sampradaya, varying, interpretations, of, the, upanishads, and, their, synthesis, the, brahma, sutras, led, to, the, development, of, different, schools, of, vedanta, over, time, vinayak, sakaram, ghate, of, bhandarkar, oriental, research, institute, conducted, a, comprehensive, comparative, analysis, of, the, brahma, sutra, commentaries, by, nimbarka, ramanuja, vallabha, shankara, and, madhva, in, his, conclusion, ghate, determined, that, nimbarka, s, and, ramanuja, s, commentaries, provide, the, most, accurate, interpretation, of, the, brahma, sutras, considering, both, the, passages, that, emphasize, unity, and, those, that, emphasize, diversity, gavin, flood, suggests, that, although, advaita, vedanta, is, the, most, well, known, school, of, vedanta, and, is, sometimes, wrongly, perceived, as, the, sole, representation, of, vedantic, thought, with, shankara, being, a, follower, of, saivism, the, true, essence, of, vedanta, lies, within, the, vaisnava, tradition, and, can, be, considered, a, discourse, within, the, broad, framework, of, vaisnavism, four, vaishnava, sampradays, are, considered, to, be, of, special, significance, based, on, the, teachings, of, ramanuja, madhva, vallabha, and, nimbarka, the, number, of, prominent, vedanta, schools, varies, among, scholars, with, some, classifying, them, as, three, to, six, bhed, bheda, means, difference, and, non, difference, and, is, more, a, tradition, than, a, school, of, vedanta, the, schools, of, this, tradition, emphasize, that, the, individual, self, j, vatman, is, both, different, and, not, different, from, brahman, notable, figures, in, this, school, are, bhartriprapancha, nimb, rka, 7th, century, who, founded, the, dvaitadvaita, school, bh, skara, 8th, 9th, century, ramanuja, s, teacher, y, davaprak, a, chaitanya, 1486, 1534, who, founded, the, achintya, bheda, abheda, school, and, vij, nabhik, u, 16th, century, nimb, rka, 7th, century, sometimes, identified, with, bh, skara, propounded, dvait, dvaita, brahman, god, souls, chit, and, matter, or, the, universe, achit, are, considered, as, three, equally, real, and, co, eternal, realities, brahman, is, the, controller, niyanta, the, soul, is, the, enjoyer, bhokta, and, the, material, universe, is, the, object, enjoyed, bhogya, the, brahman, is, krishna, the, ultimate, cause, who, is, omniscient, omnipotent, all, pervading, being, he, is, the, efficient, cause, of, the, universe, because, as, lord, of, karma, and, internal, ruler, of, souls, he, brings, about, creation, so, that, the, individual, souls, can, reap, the, consequences, of, their, karma, god, is, considered, to, be, the, material, cause, of, the, universe, because, creation, was, a, manifestation, of, his, powers, of, soul, chit, and, matter, achit, creation, is, a, transformation, parinama, of, god, s, powers, he, can, be, realized, only, through, a, constant, effort, to, merge, oneself, with, his, nature, through, meditation, and, devotion, advaita, vedanta, iast, advaita, ved, nta, sanskrit, propounded, by, gaudapada, 7th, century, and, adi, shankara, 9th, century, but, popularized, by, vidyaranya, 14th, century, and, 19th, 20th, century, neo, vedantins, espouses, non, dualism, and, monism, brahman, is, held, to, be, the, sole, unchanging, metaphysical, reality, and, identical, to, the, individual, atman, the, physical, world, on, the, other, hand, is, always, changing, empirical, maya, the, absolute, and, infinite, atman, brahman, is, realized, by, a, process, of, negating, everything, relative, finite, empirical, and, changing, the, school, accepts, no, duality, no, limited, individual, souls, atman, j, vatman, and, no, separate, unlimited, cosmic, soul, all, souls, and, their, existence, across, space, and, time, are, considered, to, be, the, same, oneness, spiritual, liberation, in, advaita, is, the, full, comprehension, and, realization, of, oneness, that, one, s, unchanging, atman, soul, is, the, same, as, the, atman, in, everyone, else, as, well, as, being, identical, to, brahman, vishishtadvaita, propounded, by, ramanuja, 11, 12th, century, asserts, that, j, vatman, human, souls, and, brahman, as, vishnu, are, different, a, difference, that, is, never, transcended, with, this, qualification, ramanuja, also, affirmed, monism, by, saying, that, there, is, unity, of, all, souls, and, that, the, individual, soul, has, the, potential, to, realize, identity, with, the, brahman, vishishtadvaita, is, a, qualified, non, dualistic, school, of, vedanta, and, like, advaita, begins, by, assuming, that, all, souls, can, hope, for, and, achieve, the, state, of, blissful, liberation, on, the, relation, between, the, brahman, and, the, world, of, matter, prakriti, vishishtadvaita, states, both, are, two, different, absolutes, both, metaphysically, true, and, real, neither, is, false, or, illusive, and, that, saguna, brahman, with, attributes, is, also, real, ramanuja, states, that, god, like, man, has, both, soul, and, body, and, the, world, of, matter, is, the, glory, of, god, s, body, the, path, to, brahman, vishnu, according, to, ramanuja, is, devotion, to, godliness, and, constant, remembrance, of, the, beauty, and, love, of, the, personal, god, bhakti, of, saguna, brahman, the, swaminarayan, darshana, also, called, akshar, purushottam, darshan, by, the, baps, was, propounded, by, swaminarayan, 1781, 1830, ce, and, is, rooted, in, ramanuja, s, vishishtadvaita, it, asserts, that, parabrahman, purushottam, narayana, and, aksharbrahman, are, two, distinct, eternal, realities, adherents, believe, that, they, can, achieve, moksha, liberation, by, becoming, aksharrup, or, brahmarup, that, is, by, attaining, qualities, similar, to, akshar, or, aksharbrahman, and, worshipping, purushottam, or, parabrahman, the, supreme, living, entity, god, tattvavada, propounded, by, madhvacharya, 13th, century, is, based, on, the, premise, of, realism, or, realistic, point, of, view, the, term, dvaita, which, means, dualism, was, later, applied, to, madhvacharya, s, philosophy, atman, soul, and, brahman, as, vishnu, are, understood, as, two, completely, different, entities, brahman, is, the, creator, of, the, universe, perfect, in, knowledge, perfect, in, knowing, perfect, in, its, power, and, distinct, from, souls, distinct, from, matter, in, dvaita, vedanta, an, individual, soul, must, feel, attraction, love, attachment, and, complete, devotional, surrender, to, vishnu, for, salvation, and, it, is, only, his, grace, that, leads, to, redemption, and, salvation, madhva, believed, that, some, souls, are, eternally, doomed, and, damned, a, view, not, found, in, advaita, and, vishishtadvaita, vedanta, while, the, vishishtadvaita, vedanta, asserted, qualitative, monism, and, quantitative, pluralism, of, souls, madhva, asserted, both, qualitative, and, quantitative, pluralism, of, souls, shuddhadvaita, pure, non, dualism, propounded, by, vallabhacharya, 1479, 1531, ce, states, that, the, entire, universe, is, real, and, is, subtly, brahman, only, in, the, form, of, krishna, vallabhacharya, agreed, with, advaita, vedanta, s, ontology, but, emphasized, that, prakriti, empirical, world, body, is, not, separate, from, the, brahman, but, just, another, manifestation, of, the, latter, everything, everyone, everywhere, soul, and, body, living, and, non, living, j, va, and, matter, is, the, eternal, krishna, the, way, to, krishna, in, this, school, is, bhakti, vallabha, opposed, renunciation, of, monistic, sannyasa, as, ineffective, and, advocates, the, path, of, devotion, bhakti, rather, than, knowledge, jnana, the, goal, of, bhakti, is, to, turn, away, from, ego, self, centered, ness, and, deception, and, to, turn, towards, the, eternal, krishna, in, everything, continually, offering, freedom, from, samsara, chaitanya, mahaprabhu, 1486, 1533, was, the, prime, exponent, of, achintya, bheda, abheda, in, sanskrit, achintya, means, inconceivable, achintya, bheda, abheda, represents, the, philosophy, of, inconceivable, difference, in, non, difference, in, relation, to, the, non, dual, reality, of, brahman, atman, which, it, calls, krishna, svayam, bhagavan, the, notion, of, inconceivability, acintyatva, is, used, to, reconcile, apparently, contradictory, notions, in, upanishadic, teachings, this, school, asserts, that, krishna, is, bhagavan, of, the, bhakti, yogins, the, brahman, of, the, jnana, yogins, and, has, a, divine, potency, that, is, inconceivable, he, is, all, pervading, and, thus, in, all, parts, of, the, universe, non, difference, yet, he, is, inconceivably, more, difference, this, school, is, at, the, foundation, of, the, gaudiya, vaishnava, religious, tradition, the, iskcon, or, the, hare, krishnas, also, affiliate, to, this, school, of, vedanta, philosophy, the, history, of, vedanta, can, be, divided, into, two, periods, one, prior, to, the, composition, of, the, brahma, sutras, and, the, other, encompassing, the, schools, that, developed, after, the, brahma, sutras, were, written, until, the, 11th, century, vedanta, was, a, peripheral, school, of, thought, little, is, known, of, schools, of, vedanta, existing, before, the, composition, of, the, brahma, sutras, first, composition, c, 2nd, cent, bce, final, redaction, 400, 450, ce, it, is, clear, that, badarayana, the, writer, of, brahma, sutras, was, not, the, first, person, to, systematize, the, teachings, of, the, upanishads, as, he, quotes, six, vedantic, teachers, before, him, ashmarathya, badari, audulomi, kashakrtsna, karsnajini, and, atreya, references, to, other, early, vedanta, teachers, brahmadatta, sundara, pandaya, tanka, and, dravidacharya, are, found, in, secondary, literature, of, later, periods, the, works, of, these, ancient, teachers, have, not, survived, but, based, on, the, quotes, attributed, to, them, in, later, literature, sharma, postulates, that, ashmarathya, and, audulomi, were, bhedabheda, scholars, kashakrtsna, and, brahmadatta, were, advaita, scholars, while, tanka, and, dravidacharya, were, either, advaita, or, vi, i, dvaita, scholars, badarayana, summarized, and, interpreted, teachings, of, the, upanishads, in, the, brahma, sutras, also, called, the, vedanta, sutra, possibly, written, from, a, bhed, bheda, ved, ntic, viewpoint, badarayana, summarized, the, teachings, of, the, classical, upanishads, and, refuted, the, rival, philosophical, schools, in, ancient, india, like, the, s, khya, system, the, brahma, sutras, laid, the, basis, for, the, development, of, vedanta, philosophy, though, attributed, to, badarayana, the, brahma, sutras, were, likely, composed, by, multiple, authors, over, the, course, of, hundreds, of, years, the, estimates, on, when, the, brahma, sutras, were, complete, vary, with, nakamura, in, 1989, and, nicholson, in, his, 2013, review, stating, that, they, were, most, likely, compiled, in, the, present, form, around, 400, 450, ce, isaeva, suggests, they, were, complete, and, in, current, form, by, 200, ce, while, nakamura, states, that, the, great, part, of, the, sutra, must, have, been, in, existence, much, earlier, than, that, 800, 500, bce, the, book, is, composed, of, four, chapters, each, divided, into, four, quarters, or, sections, these, sutras, attempt, to, synthesize, the, diverse, teachings, of, the, upanishads, however, the, cryptic, nature, of, aphorisms, of, the, brahma, sutras, have, required, exegetical, commentaries, these, commentaries, have, resulted, in, the, formation, of, numerous, vedanta, schools, each, interpreting, the, texts, in, its, own, way, and, producing, its, own, commentary, little, with, specificity, is, known, of, the, period, between, the, brahma, sutras, 5th, century, ce, and, adi, shankara, 8th, century, ce, only, two, writings, of, this, period, have, survived, the, v, kyapad, ya, written, by, bhart, hari, second, half, 5th, century, and, the, k, rik, written, by, gaudapada, early, 6th, or, 7th, century, ce, shankara, mentions, 99, different, predecessors, of, his, school, in, his, commentaries, a, number, of, important, early, vedanta, thinkers, have, been, listed, in, the, siddhitraya, by, yamun, c, rya, c, 1050, the, ved, rthasamgraha, by, r, m, nuja, c, 1050, 1157, and, the, yat, ndramatad,

period, was, bhartriprapancha, bhartriprapancha, maintained, that, the, brahman, is, one, and, there, is, unity, but, that, this, unity, has, varieties, scholars, see, bhartriprapancha, as, an, early, philosopher, in, the, line, who, teach, the, tenet, of, bhedabheda, bhed, bheda, means, difference, and, non, difference, and, is, more, a, tradition, than, a, school, of, vedanta, the, schools, of, this, tradition, emphasize, that, the, individual, self, j, vatman, is, both, different, and, not, different, from, brahman, notable, figures, in, this, tradition, are, nimb, rka, 7th, century, who,

arguments, are, devoid, of, all, religious, mystical, or, scholastic, elements, scholars, are, divided, on, a, possible, influence, of, buddhism, on, gaudapada, s, philosophy, the, fact, that, shankara, in, addition, to, the, brahma, sutras, the, principal, upanishads, and, the, bhagvad, gita, wrote, an, independent, commentary, on, the, k, rik, proves, its, importance, in, ved, ntic, literature, adi, shankara, c, 800, c, 850, elaborated, on, gaudapada, s, work, and, more, ancient, scholarship, to, write, detailed, commentaries, on, the, prasthanatrayi, and, the, k, rik, the,

and, neo, advaita, is, a, term, that, denotes, some, novel, interpretations, of, hinduism, that, developed, in, the, 19th, century, presumably, as, a, reaction, to, the, colonial, british, rule, king, 2002, pp, 129, 135, writes, that, these, notions, accorded, the, hindu, nationalists, an, opportunity, to, attempt, the, construction, of, a, nationalist, ideology, to, help, unite, the, hindus, to, fight, colonial, oppression, western, orientalists, in, their, search, for, its, essence, attempted, to, formulate, a, notion, of, hinduism, based, on, a, single, interpretation, of, vedanta, as, a, unified, body, of, religious, praxis, this, was, contra, factual, as, historically, hinduism, and, vedanta, had, always, accepted, a, diversity, of, traditions, king, 1999, pp, 133, 136, asserts, that, the, neo, vedantic, theory, of, overarching, tolerance, and, acceptance, was, used, by, the, hindu, reformers, together, with, the, ideas, of, universalism, and, perennialism, to, challenge, the, polemic, dogmatism, of, judaeo, christian, islamic, missionaries, against, the, hindus, the, neo, vedantins, argued, that, the, six, orthodox, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, were, perspectives, on, a, single, truth, all, valid, and, complementary, to, each, other, halbfass, 2007, p, 307, sees, these, interpretations, as, incorporating, western, ideas, into, traditional, systems, especially, advaita, vedanta, it, is, the, modern, form, of, advaita, vedanta, states, king, 1999, p, 135, the, neo, vedantists, subsumed, the, buddhist, philosophies, as, part, of, the, vedanta, tradition, and, then, argued, that, all, the, world, religions, are, same, non, dualistic, position, as, the, philosophia, perennis, ignoring, the, differences, within, and, outside, of, hinduism, according, to,

realistic, advaita, a, view, of, vedanta, that, rejects, the, advaitins, idea, that, the, world, is, illusory, as, aurobindo, phrased, it, philosophers, need, to, move, from, universal, illusionism, to, universal, realism, in, the, strict, philosophical, sense, of, assuming, the, world, to, be, fully, real, a, major, proponent, in, the, popularization, of, this, universalist, and, perennialist, interpretation, of, advaita, vedanta, was, vivekananda, who, played, a, major, role, in, the, revival, of, hinduism, he, was, also, instrumental, in, the, spread, of, advaita, vedanta, to, the, west, via, the, vedanta, society, the, international, arm, of, the, ramakrishna, order, nicholson, 2010, p, 2, writes, that, the, attempts, at, integration, which, came, to, be, known, as, neo, vedanta, were, evident, as, early, as, between, the, 12th, and, the, 16th, century, certain, thinkers, began, to, treat, as, a, single, whole, the, diverse, philosophical, teachings, of, the, upanishads, epics, puranas, and, the, schools, known, retrospectively, as, the, six, systems, saddarsana, of, mainstream, hindu, philosophy, matilal, criticizes, neo, hinduism, as, an, oddity, developed, by, west, inspired, western, indologists, and, attributes, it, to, the, flawed, western, perception, of, hinduism, in, modern, india, in, his, scathing, criticism, of, this, school, of, reasoning, matilal, 2002, pp, 403, 404, says, the, so, called, traditional, outlook, is, in, fact, a, construction, indian, history, shows, that, the, tradition, itself, was, self, conscious, and, critical, of, itself, sometimes, overtly, and, sometimes, covertly, it, was, never, free, from, internal, tensions, due, to, the, inequalities, that, persisted, in, a, hierarchical, society, nor, was, it, without, confrontation, and, challenge, throughout, its, history, hence, gandhi, vivekananda, and, tagore, were, not, simply, transplants, from, western, culture, products, arising, solely, from, confrontation, with, the, west, it, is, rather, odd, that, although, the, early, indologists, romantic, dream, of, discovering, a, pure, and, probably, primitive, according, to, some, form, of, hinduism, or, buddhism, as, the, case, may, be, now, stands, discredited, in, many, quarters, concepts, like, neo, hinduism, are, still, bandied, about, as, substantial, ideas, or, faultless, explanation, tools, by, the, western, analytic, historians, as, well, as, the, west, inspired, historians, of, india, according, to, nakamura, 2004, p, 3, the, vedanta, school, has, had, a, historic, and, central, influence, on, hinduism, the, prevalence, of, vedanta, thought, is, found, not, only, in, philosophical, writings, but, also, in, various, forms, of, hindu, literature, such, as, the, epics, lyric, poetry, drama, and, so, forth, the, hindu, religious, sects, the, common, faith, of, the, indian, populace, looked, to, vedanta, philosophy, for, the, theoretical, foundations, for,

traditional, spirituality, gavin, flood, states, the, most, influential, school, of, theology, in, india, has, been, vedanta, exerting, enormous, influence, on, all, religious, traditions, and,

so, exact, a, representation, of, the, ideas, of, the, vedanta, that, we, might, have, suspected, its, founder, to, have, borrowed, the, fundamental, principles, of, his, system, from, the, hindus, did, his, biography, not, satisfy, us, that, he, was, wholly, unacquainted, with, their, doctrines, comparing, the, fundamental, ideas, of, both, we, should, have, no, difficulty, in, proving, that, had, spinoza, been, a, hindu, his, system, would, in, all, probability, mark, a, last, phase, of, the, vedanta, philosophy, max, m, ller, noted, the, striking, similarities, between, vedanta, and, the, system, of, spinoza, saying, the, brahman, as, conceived, in, the, upanishads, and, defined, by, sankara, is, clearly, the, same, as, spinoza, s, substantia, helena, blavatsky, a, founder, of,
