large, body, of, religious, texts, originating, in, ancient, india, composed, in, vedic, sanskrit, the, texts, constitute, the, oldest, layer, of, sanskrit, literature, and, the, oldest, scriptures, of, hinduism, there, are, four, vedas, the, rigveda, the, yajurveda, the, samaveda, and, the, atharvaveda, each, veda, has, four, subdivisions, the, samhitas, mantras, and, benedictions, the,

akin, to, the, heterodox, sramana, traditions, the, samhitas, and, brahmanas, describe, about, daily, rituals, and, are, generally, meant, for, brahmacharya, and, gr, hastha, stages, of, the, chaturashrama, system, while, the, aranyakas, and, upanishads, are, meant, for, the, v, naprastha, and, sannyasa, stages, respectively, vedas, are, ruti, what, is, heard, distinguishing, them, from, other, religious, texts, which, are, called, smr, ti, what, is, remembered, hindus, consider, the, vedas, to, be, apauru, eya, which, means, not, of, a, man, superhuman, and, impersonal, authorless, revelations, of, sacred, sounds, and, texts, heard, by, ancient, sages, after, intense, meditation, the, vedas, have, been, orally, transmitted, since, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, with, the, help, of, elaborate, mnemonic, techniques, the, mantras, the, oldest, part, of, the, vedas, are, recited, in, the, modern, age, for, their, phonology, rather, than, the, semantics, and, are, considered, to, be, primordial, rhythms, of, creation, preceding, the, forms, to, which, they, refer, by, reciting, them, the, cosmos, is, regenerated, by, enlivening, and, nourishing, the, forms, of, creation, at, their, base, the, various, indian, philosophies, and, hindu, sects, have, taken, differing, positions, on, the, vedas, schools, of, indian, philosophy, that, acknowledge, the, importance, or, primal, authority, of, the, vedas, comprise, hindu, philosophy, specifically, and, are, together, classified, as, the, six, orthodox, stika, schools, however, rama, a, traditions, such, as, charvaka, ajivika, buddhism, and, jainism, which, did, not, regard, the, vedas, as, authoritative, are, referred, to, as, heterodox, or, non, orthodox, n, stika, schools, the, sanskrit, word, v, da, knowledge, wisdom, is, derived, from, the, root, vid, to, know, this, is, reconstructed, as, being, derived, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, weyd, meaning, see, or, know, the, noun, is, from, proto, indo,

such, as, hymn, 10, 93, 11, of, the, rigveda, means, obtaining, or, finding, wealth, property, while, in, some, others, it, means, a, bunch, of, grass, together, as, in, a, broom, or, for, ritual, fire, the, term, vedic, texts, is, used, in, two, distinct, meanings, the, corpus, of, vedic, sanskrit, texts, includes, while, production, of, brahmanas, and, aranyakas, ceased, with, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, additional, upanishads, were, composed, after, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, the, brahmanas, aranyakas, and, upanishads, among, other, things, interpret, and, discuss, the, samhitas, in, philosophical, and, metaphorical, ways, to, explore, abstract, concepts, such, as, the, absolute, brahman, and, the, soul, or, the, self, atman, introducing, vedanta, philosophy, one, of, the, major, trends, of, later, hinduism, in, other, parts, they, show, evolution, of, ideas, such, as, from, actual, sacrifice, to, symbolic, sacrifice, and, of, spirituality, in, the, upanishads, this, has, inspired, later, hindu, scholars, such, as, adi, shankara, to, classify, each, veda, into, karma, kanda, action, sacrificial, ritual, related, sections, the, samhitas, and, brahmanas, and, jnana, kanda, knowledge, spirituality, related, sections, mainly, the, upanishads, vedas, are, ruti, what, is, heard, distinguishing, them, from, other, religious, texts, which, are, called, sm, ti, what, is, remembered, this, indigenous, system, of, categorization, was, adopted, by, max, m, ller, and, while, it, is, subject, to, some, debate, it, is, still, widely, used, as, axel, michaels, explains, these, classifications, are, often, not, tenable, for, linguistic, and, formal, reasons, there, is, not, only, one, collection, at, any, one, time, but, rather, several, handed, down, in, separate, vedic, schools, upani, ads, are, sometimes, not, to, be, distinguished, from, ra, yakas, br, hma, as, contain, older, strata, of, language, attributed, to, the, sa, hit, s, there, are, various, dialects, and, locally, prominent, traditions, of, the, vedic, schools, nevertheless, it, is, advisable, to, stick, to, the, division, adopted, by, max, m, ller, because, it, follows, the, indian, tradition, conveys, the, historical, sequence, fairly, accurately, and, underlies, the, current, editions, translations, and, monographs, on, vedic, literature, among, the, widely, known, rutis, include, the, vedas, and, their, embedded, texts, the, samhitas, the, upanishads, the, brahmanas, and, the, aranyakas, the, well, known, sm, tis, include, bhagavad, gita, bhagavata, purana, and, the, epics, ramayana, and, mahabharata, amongst, others, hindus, consider, the, vedas, to, be, apauru, ey, which, means, not, of, a, man, superhuman, and, impersonal, authorless, the, vedas, for, orthodox, indian, theologians, are, considered, revelations, seen, by, ancient, sages, after, intense, meditation, and, texts, that, have, been, more, carefully, preserved, since, ancient, times, in, the, hindu, epic, mahabharata, the, creation, of, vedas, is, credited, to, brahma, the, vedic, hymns, themselves, assert, that, they, were, skillfully, created, by, rishis, sages, after, inspired, creativity, just, as, a, carpenter, builds, a, chariot, the, oldest, part, of, the, rig, veda, samhita, was, orally, composed, in, north, western, india, punjab, between, c, 1500, and, 1200, bce,

the, compiler, of, the, vedas, who, arranged, the, four, kinds, of, mantras, into, four, samhitas, collections, the, vedas, are, among, the, oldest, sacred, texts, the, bulk, of, the, rigveda, samhita, was, composed, in, the, northwestern, region, punjab, of, the, indian, subcontinent, most, likely, between, c, 1500, and, 1200, bce, although, a, wider, approximation, of, c, 1700, 1100, bce, has, also, been, given, the, other, three, samhitas, are, considered, to, date, from, the, time, of, the, kuru, kingdom, approximately, c, 1200, 900, bce, the, circum, vedic, texts, as, well, as, the, redaction, of, the, samhitas, date, to, c, 1000, 500, bce, resulting, in, a, vedic, period, spanning, the, mid, 2nd, to, mid, 1st, millennium, bce, or, the, late, bronze, age, and, the, iron, age, the, vedic, period, reaches, its, peak, only, after, the, composition, of, the, mantra, texts, with, the, establishment, of, the, various, shakhas, all, over, northern, india, which, annotated, the, mantra, samhitas, with, brahmana, discussions, of, their, meaning, and, reaches, its, end, in, the, age, of, buddha, and, panini, and, the, rise, of, the, mahajanapadas, archaeologically, northern,

bce, the, only, epigraphic, record, of, indo, aryan, contemporary, to, the, rigvedic, period, he, gives, 150, bce, pata, jali, as, a, terminus, ante, quem, for, all, vedic, sanskrit, literature, and, 1200, bce, the, early, iron, age, as, terminus, post, quem, for, the, atharvaveda, the, vedas, were, orally, transmitted, since, their, composition, in, the, vedic, period, for, several, millennia, the, authoritative, transmission, of, the, vedas, is, by, an, oral, tradition, in, a, sampradaya, from, father, to, son, or, from, teacher, guru, to, student, shishya, believed, to, be, initiated, by, the, vedic, rishis, who, heard, the, primordial, sounds, only, this, tradition, embodied, by, a, living, teacher, can, teach, the, correct, pronunciation, of, the, sounds, and, explain, hidden, meanings, in, a, way, the, dead, and, entombed, manuscript, cannot, do, as, leela, prasad, states, according, to, shankara, the, correct, tradition, sampradaya, has, as, much, authority, as, the, written, shastra, explaining, that, the, tradition, bears, the, authority, to, clarify, and, provide, direction, in, the, application, of, knowledge, the, emphasis, in, this, transmission, is, on, the, proper, articulation, and, pronunciation, of, the, vedic, sounds, as, prescribed, in, the, shiksha, the, vedanga, vedic, study, of, sound, as, uttered, in, a, vedic, recitation, mastering, the, texts, literally, forward, and, backward, in, fully, acoustic, fashion, houben, and, rath, note, that, the, vedic, textual, tradition, cannot, simply, be, characterized, as, oral, since, it, also, depends, significantly, on, a, memory, culture, the, vedas, were, preserved, with, precision, with, the, help, of, elaborate, mnemonic, techniques, such, as, memorizing, the, texts, in, eleven, different, modes, of, recitation, pathas, using, the, alphabet, as, a, mnemotechnical, device, matching, physical, movements, such, as, nodding, the, head, with, particular, sounds, and, chanting, in, a, group, and, visualizing, sounds, by, using, mudras, hand, signs, this, provided, an, additional, visual, confirmation, and, also, an, alternate, means, to, check, the, reading, integrity, by, the, audience, in, addition, to, the, audible, means, houben, and, rath, note, that, a, strong, memory, culture, existed, in, ancient, india, when, texts, were, transmitted, orally, before, the, advent, of, writing, in, the, early, first, millennium, ce, according, to, staal, criticising, the, goody, watt, hypothesis, according, to, which, literacy, is, more, reliable, than, orality, this, tradition, of, oral, transmission, is, closely, related, to, indian, forms, of, science, and, by, far, the, more, remarkable, than, the, relatively, recent, tradition, of, written, transmission, while, according, to, mookerji, understanding, the, meaning, vedarthajnana, or, artha, bodha, of, the, words, of, the, vedas, was, part, of, the, vedic, learning, holdrege, and, other, indologists, have, noted, that, in, the, transmission, of, the, samhitas, the, emphasis, is, on, the, phonology, of, the, sounds, abda, and, not, on, the, meaning, artha, of, the, mantras, already, at, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, their, original, meaning, had, become, obscure, for, ordinary, people, and, niruktas, etymological, compendia, were, developed, to, preserve, and, clarify, the, original, meaning, of, many, sanskrit, words, according, to, staal, as, referenced, by, holdrege, though, the, mantras, may, have, a, discursive, meaning, when, the, mantras, are, recited, in, the, vedic, rituals, they, are, disengaged, from, their, original, context, and, are, employed, in, ways, that, have, little, or, nothing, to, do, with, their, meaning, the, words, of, the, mantras, are, themselves, sacred, and, do, not, constitute, linguistic, utterances, instead, as, klostermaier, notes, in, their, application, in, vedic, rituals, they, become, magical, sounds, means, to, an, end, holdrege, notes, that, there, are, scarce, commentaries, on, the, meaning, of, the, mantras, in, contrast, to, the, number, of, commentaries, on, the, brahmanas, and, upanishads, but, states, that, the, lack, of, emphasis, on, the, discursive, meaning, does, not, necessarily, imply, that, they, are, meaningless, in, the, brahmanical, perspective, the, sounds, have, their, own, meaning, mantras, are, considered, as, primordial, rhythms, of, creation, preceding, the, forms, to, which, they, refer, by, reciting, them, the, cosmos, is, regenerated, by, enlivening, and, nourishing, the, forms, of, creation, at, their, base, as, long, as, the, purity, of, the, sounds, is, preserved, the, recitation, of, the, mantras, will, be, efficacious, irrespective, of, whether, their, discursive, meaning, is, understood, by, human, beings, frazier, further, notes, that, later, vedic, texts, sought, deeper, understanding, of, the, reasons, the, rituals, worked, which, indicates, that, the, brahmin, communities, considered, study, to, be, a, process, of, understanding, a, literary, tradition, is, traceable, in, post, vedic, times, after, the, rise, of, buddhism, in, the, maurya, period, perhaps, earliest, in, the, kanva, recension, of, the, yajurveda, about, the, 1st, century, bce, however, oral, tradition, of, transmission, remained, active, jack, goody, has, argued, for, an, earlier, literary, tradition, concluding, that, the, vedas, bear, hallmarks, of, a, literate, culture, along, with, oral, transmission, but, goody, s, views, have, been, strongly, criticised, by, falk, lopez, jr, and, staal, though, they, have, also, found, some, support, the, vedas, were, written, down, only, after, 500, bce, but, only, the, orally, transmitted, texts, are, regarded, as, authoritative, given, the, emphasis, on, the, exact, pronunciation, of, the, sounds, witzel, suggests, that, attempts, to, write, down, the, vedic, texts, towards, the, end, of, 1st, millennium, bce, were, unsuccessful, resulting, in, smriti, rules, explicitly, forbidding, the, writing, down, of, the, vedas, due, to, the, ephemeral, nature, of, the, manuscript, material, birch, bark, or, palm, leaves, surviving, manuscripts, rarely, surpass, an, age, of, a, few, hundred, years, the, sampurnanand, sanskrit, university, has, a, rigveda, manuscript, from, the, 14th, century, however, there, are, a, number, of, older, veda, manuscripts, in, nepal, that, are, dated, from, the, 11th, century, onwards, the, vedas, vedic, rituals, and, its, ancillary, sciences, called, the, vedangas, were, part, of, the, curriculum, at, ancient, universities, such, as, at, taxila, nalanda, and, vikramashila, according, to, deshpande, the, tradition, of, the, sanskrit, grammarians, also, contributed, significantly, to, the, preservation, and, interpretation, of, vedic, texts, y, ska, 4th, c, bce, wrote, the, nirukta, which, reflects, the, concerns, about, the, loss, of, meaning, of, the, mantras, while, p, inis, 4th, c, bce, a, dhy, y, is, the, most, important, surviving, text, of, the, vy, kara, a, traditions, mimamsa, scholar, sayanas, 14th, c, ce, major, vedartha, prakasha, is, a, rare, commentary, on, the, vedas, which, is, also, referred, to, by, contemporary, scholars, yaska, and, sayana, reflecting, an, ancient, understanding, state, that, the, veda, can, be, interpreted, in, three, ways, giving, the, truth, about, gods, dharma, and, parabrahman, the, p, rva, k, da, or, karma, kanda, the, part, of, the, veda, dealing, with, ritual, gives, knowledge, of, dharma, which, brings, us, satisfaction, the, uttara, kanda, or, jnana, kanda, the, part, of, the, veda, dealing, with, the, knowledge, of, the, absolute, gives, knowledge, of, parabrahma, which, fulfills, all, of, our, desires, according, to, holdrege, for, the, exponents, of, karma, kandha, the, veda, is, to, be, inscribed, in, the, minds, and, hearts, of, men, by, memorization, and, recitation, while, for, the, exponents, of, the, jnana, kanda, and, meditation, the, vedas, express, a, transcendental, reality, which, can, be, approached, with, mystical, means, holdrege, notes, that, in, vedic, learning, priority, has, been, given, to, recitation, over, interpretation, of, the, samhitas, galewicz, states, that, sayana, a, mimamsa, scholar, thinks, of, the, veda, as, something, to, be, trained, and, mastered, to, be, put, into, practical, ritual, use, noticing, that, it, is, not, the, meaning, of, the, mantras, that, is, most, essential, but, rather, the, perfect, mastering, of, their, sound, form, according, to, galewicz, sayana, saw, the, purpose, artha, of, the, veda, as, the, artha, of, carrying, out, sacrifice, giving, precedence, to, the, yajurveda, for, sayana, whether, the, mantras, had, meaning, depended, on, the, context, of, their, practical, usage, this, conception, of, the, veda, as, a, repertoire, to, be, mastered, and, performed, takes, precedence, over, the, internal, meaning, or, autonomous, message, of, the, hymns, most, rauta, rituals, are, not, performed, in, the, modern, era, and, those, that, are, are, rare, mukherjee, notes, that, the, rigveda, and, sayana, s, commentary, contain, passages, criticizing, as, fruitless, mere, recitation, of, the, ik, words, without, understanding, their, inner, meaning, or, essence, the, knowledge, of, dharma, and, parabrahman, mukherjee, concludes, that, in, the, rigvedic, education, of, the, mantras, the, contemplation, and, comprehension, of, their, meaning, was, considered, as, more, important, and, vital, to, education, than, their, mere, mechanical, repetition, and, correct, pronunciation, mookei, refers, to, sayana, as, stating, that, the, mastery, of, texts, akshara, prapt, is, followed, by, artha, bodha, perception, of, their, meaning, mukherjee, explains, that, the, vedic, knowledge, was, first, perceived, by, the, rishis, and, munis, only, the, perfect, language, of, the, vedas, as, in, contrast, to, ordinary, speech, can, reveal, these, truths, which, were, preserved, by, committing, them, to, memory, according, to, mukherjee, while, these, truths, are, imparted, to, the, student, by, the, memorized, texts, the, realization, of, truth, and, the, knowledge, of, paramatman, as, revealed, to, the, rishis, is, the, real, aim, of, vedic, learning, and, not, the, mere, recitation, of, texts, the, supreme, knowledge, of, the, absolute, para, brahman, jnana, the, knowledge, of, rta, and, satya, can, be, obtained, by, taking, vows, of, silence, and, obedience, sense, restraint, dhyana, the, practice, of, tapas, austerities, and, discussing, the, vedanta, the, four, vedas, were, transmitted, in, various, kh, s, branches, schools, each, school, likely, represented, an, ancient, community, of, a, particular, area, or, kingdom, each, school, followed, its, own, canon, multiple, recensions, revisions, are, known, for, each, of, the, vedas, thus, states, witzel, as, well, as, renou, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, there, was, likely, no, canon, of, one, broadly, accepted, vedic, texts, no, vedic, scripture, but, only, a, canon, of, various, texts, accepted, by, each, school, some, of, these, texts, have, survived, most, lost, or, yet, to, be, found, rigveda, that, survives, in, modern, times, for, example, is, in, only, one, extremely, well, preserved, school, of, kalya, from, a, region, called, videha, in, modern, north, bihar, south, of, nepal, the, vedic, canon, in, its, entirety, consists, of, texts, from, all, the, various, vedic, schools, taken, together, there, were, vedic, schools, that, believed, in, polytheism, in, which, numerous, gods, had, different, natural, functions, henotheistic, beliefs, where, only, one, god, was, worshipped, but, others, were, thought, to, exist, monotheistic, beliefs, in, a, single, god, agnosticism, and, monistic, beliefs, where, there, is, an, absolute, reality, that, goes, beyond, the, gods, and, that, includes, or, transcends, everything, that, exists, indra, agni, and, yama, were, popular, subjects, of, worship, by, polytheist, organizations, each, of, the, four, vedas, were, shared, by, the, numerous, schools, but, revised, interpolated, and, adapted, locally, in, and, after, the, vedic, period, giving, rise, to, various, recensions, of, the, text, some, texts, were, revised, into, the, modern, era, raising, significant, debate, on, parts, of, the, text, which, are, believed, to, have, been, corrupted, at, a, later, date, the, vedas, each, have, an, index, or, anukramani, the, principal, work, of, this, kind, being, the, general, index, or, sarv, nukrama, prodigious, energy, was, expended, by, ancient, indian, culture, in, ensuring, that, these, texts, were, transmitted, from, generation, to, generation, with, inordinate, fidelity, for, example, memorization, of, the, sacred, vedas, included, up, to, eleven, forms, of, recitation, of, the, same, text, the, texts, were, subsequently, proof, read, by, comparing, the, different, recited, versions, forms, of, recitation, included, the, ja, p, ha, literally, mesh, recitation, in, which, every, two, adjacent, words, in, the, text, were, first, recited, in, their, original, order, then, repeated, in, the, reverse, order, and, finally, repeated, in, the, original, order, that, these, methods, have, been, effective, is, attested, to, by, the, preservation, of, the, most, ancient, indian, religious, text, the, rigveda, as, redacted, into, a, single, text, during, the, brahmana, period, without, any, variant, readings, within, that, school, the, vedas, were, orally, transmitted, by, memorization, and, were, written, down, only, after, 500, bce, all, printed, editions, of, the, vedas, that, survive, in, the, modern, times, are, likely, the, version, existing, in, about, the, 16th, century, ce, the, canonical, division, of, the, vedas, is, fourfold, tur, ya, viz, of, these, the, first, three, were, the, principal, original, division, also, called, tray, vidy, that, is, the, triple, science, of, reciting, hymns, rigveda, performing, sacrifices, yajurveda, and, chanting, songs, samaveda, the, rig, veda, most, likely, was, composed, between, c, 1500, bce, and, 1200, bce, witzel, notes, that, it, is, the, vedic, period, itself, where, incipient, lists, divide, the, vedic, texts, into, three, tray, or, four, branches, rig, yajur, sama, and, atharva, each, veda, has, been, subclassified, into, four, major, text, types, the, samhitas, mantras, and, benedictions, the,

the, indo, european, marriage, rituals, observed, in, a, region, spanning, the, indian, subcontinent, persia, and, the, european, area, and, some, greater, details, are, found, in, the, vedic, era,

magical, formulas, an, epithet, declared, to, be, incorrect, by, other, scholars, the, samhita, layer, of, the, text, likely, represents, a, developing, 2nd, millennium, bce, tradition, of, magico, religious, rites, to, address, superstitious, anxiety, spells, to, remove, maladies, believed, to, be, caused, by, demons, and, herbs, and, nature, derived, potions, as, medicine, the, text, states,

many, books, of, the, atharvaveda, samhita, are, dedicated, to, rituals, without, magic, such, as, to, philosophical, speculations, and, to, theosophy, the, atharva, veda, has, been, a, primary, source, for, information, about, vedic, culture, the, customs, and, beliefs, the, aspirations, and, frustrations, of, everyday, vedic, life, as, well, as, those, associated, with, kings, and, governance, the, text, also, includes, hymns, dealing, with, the, two, major, rituals, of, passage, marriage, and, cremation, the, atharva, veda, also, dedicates, significant, portion, of, the, text, asking, the, meaning, of, a, ritual, the, brahmanas, are, commentaries, explanation, of, proper, methods, and, meaning, of, vedic, samhita, rituals, in, the, four, vedas, they, also, incorporate, myths, legends, and, in, some, cases, philosophy, each, regional, vedic, shakha, school, has, its, own, operating, manual, like, brahmana, text, most, of, which, have, been, lost, a, total, of, 19,

to, about, 900, bce, while, the, youngest, brahmanas, such, as, the, shatapatha, brahmana, were, complete, by, about, 700, bce, according, to, jan, gonda, the, final, codification, of, the, brahmanas, took, place, in, pre, buddhist, times, ca, 600, bce, the, substance, of, the, brahmana, text, varies, with, each, veda, for, example, the, first, chapter, of, the, chandogya, brahmana, one, of, the, oldest, brahmanas, includes, eight, ritual, suktas, hymns, for, the, ceremony, of, marriage, and, rituals, at, the, birth, of, a, child, the, first, hymn, is, a, recitation, that, accompanies, offering, a, yajna, oblation, to, agni, fire, on, the, occasion, of, a, marriage, and, the, hymn, prays, for, prosperity, of, the, couple, getting, married, the, second, hymn, wishes, for, their, long, life, kind, relatives, and, a, numerous, progeny, the, third, hymn, is, a, mutual, marriage, pledge, between, the, bride, and, groom, by, which, the, two, bind, themselves, to, each, other, the, sixth, through, last, hymns, of, the, first, chapter, in, chandogya, brahmana, are, ritual, celebrations, on, the, birth, of, a, child, and, wishes, for, health, wealth, and, prosperity, with, a, profusion, of, cows, and, artha, however, these, verses, are, incomplete, expositions, and, their, complete, context, emerges, only, with, the, samhita, layer, of, text, the, aranyakas, layer, of, the, vedas, include, rituals, discussion, of, symbolic, meta, rituals, as, well, as, philosophical, speculations, aranyakas, however, neither, are, homogeneous, in, content, nor, in, structure, they, are, a, medley, of, instructions, and, ideas, and, some, include, chapters, of, upanishads, within, them, two, theories, have, been, proposed, on, the, origin, of, the, word, aranyakas, one, theory, holds, that, these, texts, were, meant, to, be, studied, in, a, forest, while, the, other, holds, that, the, name, came, from, these, being, the, manuals, of, allegorical, interpretation, of, sacrifices, for, those, in, vanaprastha, retired, forest, dwelling, stage, of, their, life, according, to, the, historic, age, based, ashrama, system, of, human, life, the, upanishads, reflect, the, last, composed, layer, of, texts, in, the, vedas, they, are, commonly, referred, to, as, ved, nta, variously, interpreted, to, mean, either, the, last, chapters, parts, of, the, vedas, or, the, object, the, highest, purpose, of, the, veda, the, central, concern, of, the, upanishads, are, the, connections, between, parts, of, the, human, organism, and, cosmic, realities, the, upanishads, intend, to, create, a, hierarchy, of, connected, and, dependent, realities, evoking, a, sense, of, unity, of, the, separate, elements, of, the, world, and, of, human, experience, them, into, a, single, form, the, concepts, of, brahman, the, ultimate, reality, from, which, everything, arises, and, tman, the, essence, of, the, individual, are, central, ideas, in, the, upanishads, and, knowing, the, correspondence, between, tman, and, brahman, as, the, fundamental, principle, which, shapes, the, world, permits, the, creation, of, an, integrative, vision, of, the, whole, the, upanishads, are, the, foundation, of, hindu, philosophical, thought, and, its, diverse, traditions, and, of, the, vedic, corpus, they, alone, are, widely, known, and, the, central, ideas, of, the, upanishads, have, influenced, the, diverse, traditions, of, hinduism, aranyakas, are, sometimes, identified, as, karma, kanda, ritualistic, section, while, the, upanishads, are, identified, as, jnana, kanda, spirituality, section, in, an, alternate, classification, the, early, part, of, vedas, are, called, samhitas, and, the, commentary, are, called, the, brahmanas, which, together, are, identified, as, the, ceremonial, karma, kanda, while, aranyakas, and, upanishads, are, referred, to, as, the, jnana, kanda, the, vedangas, developed, towards, the, end, of, the, vedic, period, around, or, after, the, middle, of, the, 1st, millennium, bce, these, auxiliary, fields, of, vedic, studies, emerged, because, the, language, of, the, vedas, composed, centuries, earlier, became, too, archaic, to, the, people, of, that, time, the, vedangas, were, sciences, that, focused, on, helping, understand, and, interpret, the, vedas, that, had, been, composed, many, centuries, earlier, the, six, subjects, of, vedanga, are, phonetics, ik, poetic, meter, chandas, grammar, vy, kara, a, etymology, and, linguistics, nirukta, rituals, and, rites, of, passage, kalpa, time, keeping, and, astronomy, jyoti, a, vedangas, developed, as, ancillary, studies, for, the, vedas, but, its, insights, into, meters, structure, of, sound, and, language, grammar, linguistic, analysis, and, other, subjects, influenced, post, vedic, studies, arts, culture, and, various, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, the, kalpa, vedanga, studies, for, example, gave, rise, to, the, dharma, sutras, which, later, expanded, into, dharma, shastras, pari, i, a, supplement, appendix, is, the, term, applied, to, various, ancillary, works, of, vedic, literature, dealing, mainly, with, details, of, ritual, and, elaborations, of, the, texts, logically, and, chronologically, prior, to, them, the, samhitas, brahmanas, aranyakas, and, sutras, naturally, classified, with, the, veda, to, which, each, pertains, parisista, works, exist, for, each, of, the, four, vedas, however, only, the, literature, associated, with, the, atharvaveda, is, extensive, the, term, upaveda, applied, knowledge, is, used, in, traditional, literature, to, designate, the, subjects, of, certain, technical, works, lists, of, what, subjects, are, included, in, this, class, differ, among, sources, the, charanavyuha, mentions, four, upavedas, some, post, vedic, texts, including, the, mahabharata, the, natyasastra, and, certain, puranas, refer, to, themselves, as, the, fifth, veda, the, earliest, reference, to, such, a, fifth, veda, is,

sangam, literature, dated, to, the, 5th, century, bce, the, vedas, were, read, by, almost, every, caste, in, ancient, tamil, nadu, an, indian, historian, archaeologist, and, epigraphist, named, ramachandran, nagaswamy, mentions, that, tamil, nadu, was, a, land, of, vedas, and, a, place, where, everyone, knew, the, vedas, the, vedas, are, also, considered, as, a, text, filled, with, deep,

is, full, of, impurity, produces, but, scanty, and, transitory, fruits, and, is, limited, though, many, religious, hindus, implicitly, acknowledge, the, authority, of, the, vedas, this, acknowledgment, is, often, no, more, than, a, declaration, that, someone, considers, himself, a, hindu, and, most, indians, today, pay, lip, service, to, the, veda, and, have, no, regard, for, the,
