beauty, is, commonly, described, as, a, feature, of, objects, that, makes, them, pleasurable, to, perceive, such, objects, include, landscapes, sunsets, humans, and, works, of, art, beauty, art, and, taste, are, the, main, subjects, of, aesthetics, one, of, the, fields, of, study, within, philosophy, as, a, positive, aesthetic, value, it, is, contrasted, with, ugliness, as, its, negative, counterpart, one, difficulty, in, understanding, beauty, is, that, it, has, both, objective, and, subjective, aspects, it, is, seen, as, a, property, of, things, but, also, as, depending, on, the, emotional, response, of, observers, because, of, its, subjective, side, beauty, is, said, to, be, in, the, eye, of, the, beholder, it, has, been, argued, that, the, ability, on, the, side, of, the, subject, needed, to, perceive, and, judge, beauty, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, sense, of, taste, can, be, trained, and, that, the, verdicts, of, experts, coincide, in, the, long, run, this, suggests, the, standards, of, validity, of, judgments, of, beauty, are, intersubjective, i, e, dependent, on, a, group, of, judges, rather, than, fully, subjective, or, objective, conceptions, of, beauty, aim, to, capture, what, is, essential, to, all, beautiful, things, classical, conceptions, define, beauty, in, terms, of, the, relation, between, the, beautiful, object, as, a, whole, and, its, parts, the, parts, should, stand, in, the, right, proportion, to, each, other, and, thus, compose, an, integrated, harmonious, whole, hedonist, conceptions, see, a, necessary, connection, between, pleasure, and, beauty, e, g, that, for, an, object, to, be, beautiful, is, for, it, to, cause, disinterested, pleasure, other, conceptions, include, defining, beautiful, objects, in, terms, of, their, value, of, a, loving, attitude, toward, them, or, of, their, function, beauty, together, with, art, and, taste, is, the, main, subject, of, aesthetics, one, of, the, major, branches, of, philosophy, beauty, is, usually, categorized, as, an, aesthetic, property, besides, other, properties, like, grace, elegance, or, the, sublime, as, a, positive, aesthetic, value, beauty, is, contrasted, with, ugliness, as, its, negative, counterpart, beauty, is, often, listed, as, one, of, the, three, fundamental, concepts, of, human, understanding, besides, truth, and, goodness, objectivists, or, realists, see, beauty, as, an, objective, or, mind, independent, feature, of, beautiful, things, which, is, denied, by, subjectivists, the, source, of, this, debate, is, that, judgments, of, beauty, seem, to, be, based, on, subjective, grounds, namely, our, feelings, while, claiming, universal, correctness, at, the, same, time, this, tension, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, antinomy, of, taste, adherents, of, both, sides, have, suggested, that, a, certain, faculty, commonly, called, a, sense, of, taste, is, necessary, for, making, reliable, judgments, about, beauty, david, hume, for, example, suggests, that, this, faculty, can, be, trained, and, that, the, verdicts, of, experts, coincide, in, the, long, run, beauty, is, mainly, discussed, in, relation, to, concrete, objects, accessible, to, sensory, perception, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, beauty, of, a, thing, supervenes, on, the, sensory, features, of, this, thing, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, abstract, objects, like, stories, or, mathematical, proofs, can, be, beautiful, beauty, plays, a, central, role, in, works, of, art, and, nature, an, influential, distinction, among, beautiful, things, according, to, immanuel, kant, is, that, between, adherent, beauty, pulchritudo, adhaerens, and, free, beauty, pulchritudo, vaga, a, thing, has, adherent, beauty, if, its, beauty, depends, on, the, conception, or, function, of, this, thing, unlike, free, or, absolute, beauty, examples, of, adherent, beauty, include, an, ox, which, is, beautiful, as, an, ox, but, not, beautiful, as, a, horse, or, a, photograph, which, is, beautiful, because, it, depicts, a, beautiful, building, but, that, lacks, beauty, generally, speaking, because, of, its, low, quality, judgments, of, beauty, seem, to, occupy, an, intermediary, position, between, objective, judgments, e, g, concerning, the, mass, and, shape, of, a, grapefruit, and, subjective, likes, e, g, concerning, whether, the, grapefruit, tastes, good, judgments, of, beauty, differ, from, the, former, because, they, are, based, on, subjective, feelings, rather, than, objective, perception, but, they, also, differ, from, the, latter, because, they, lay, claim, on, universal, correctness, this, tension, is, also, reflected, in, common, language, on, the, one, hand, we, talk, about, beauty, as, an, objective, feature, of, the, world, that, is, ascribed, for, example, to, landscapes, paintings, or, humans, the, subjective, side, on, the, other, hand, is, expressed, in, sayings, like, beauty, is, in, the, eye, of, the, beholder, these, two, positions, are, often, referred, to, as, objectivism, or, realism, and, subjectivism, objectivism, is, the, traditional, view, while, subjectivism, developed, more, recently, in, western, philosophy, objectivists, hold, that, beauty, is, a, mind, independent, feature, of, things, on, this, account, the, beauty, of, a, landscape, is, independent, of, who, perceives, it, or, whether, it, is, perceived, at, all, disagreements, may, be, explained, by, an, inability, to, perceive, this, feature, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, lack, of, taste, subjectivism, on, the, other, hand, denies, the, mind, independent, existence, of, beauty, influential, for, the, development, of, this, position, was, john, locke, s, distinction, between, primary, qualities, which, the, object, has, independent, of, the, observer, and, secondary, qualities, which, constitute, powers, in, the, object, to, produce, certain, ideas, in, the, observer, when, applied, to, beauty, there, is, still, a, sense, in, which, it, depends, on, the, object, and, its, powers, but, this, account, makes, the, possibility, of, genuine, disagreements, about, claims, of, beauty, implausible, since, the, same, object, may, produce, very, different, ideas, in, distinct, observers, the, notion, of, taste, can, still, be, used, to, explain, why, different, people, disagree, about, what, is, beautiful, but, there, is, no, objectively, right, or, wrong, taste, there, are, just, different, tastes, the, problem, with, both, the, objectivist, and, the, subjectivist, position, in, their, extreme, form, is, that, each, has, to, deny, some, intuitions, about, beauty, this, issue, is, sometimes, discussed, under, the, label, antinomy, of, taste, it, has, prompted, various, philosophers, to, seek, a, unified, theory, that, can, take, all, these, intuitions, into, account, one, promising, route, to, solve, this, problem, is, to, move, from, subjective, to, intersubjective, theories, which, hold, that, the, standards, of, validity, of, judgments, of, taste, are, intersubjective, or, dependent, on, a, group, of, judges, rather, than, objective, this, approach, tries, to, explain, how, genuine, disagreement, about, beauty, is, possible, despite, the, fact, that, beauty, is, a, mind, dependent, property, dependent, not, on, an, individual, but, a, group, a, closely, related, theory, sees, beauty, as, a, secondary, or, response, dependent, property, on, one, such, account, an, object, is, beautiful, if, it, causes, pleasure, by, virtue, of, its, aesthetic, properties, the, problem, that, different, people, respond, differently, can, be, addressed, by, combining, response, dependence, theories, with, so, called, ideal, observer, theories, it, only, matters, how, an, ideal, observer, would, respond, there, is, no, general, agreement, on, how, ideal, observers, are, to, be, defined, but, it, is, usually, assumed, that, they, are, experienced, judges, of, beauty, with, a, fully, developed, sense, of, taste, this, suggests, an, indirect, way, of, solving, the, antinomy, of, taste, instead, of, looking, for, necessary, and, sufficient, conditions, of, beauty, itself, one, can, learn, to, identify, the, qualities, of, good, critics, and, rely, on, their, judgments, this, approach, only, works, if, unanimity, among, experts, was, ensured, but, even, experienced, judges, may, disagree, in, their, judgments, which, threatens, to, undermine, ideal, observer, theories, various, conceptions, of, the, essential, features, of, beautiful, things, have, been, proposed, but, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, which, is, the, right, one, the, classical, conception, see, classicism, defines, beauty, in, terms, of, the, relation, between, the, beautiful, object, as, a, whole, and, its, parts, the, parts, should, stand, in, the, right, proportion, to, each, other, and, thus, compose, an, integrated, harmonious, whole, on, this, account, which, found, its, most, explicit, articulation, in, the, italian, renaissance, the, beauty, of, a, human, body, for, example, depends, among, other, things, on, the, right, proportion, of, the, different, parts, of, the, body, and, on, the, overall, symmetry, one, problem, with, this, conception, is, that, it, is, difficult, to, give, a, general, and, detailed, description, of, what, is, meant, by, harmony, between, parts, and, raises, the, suspicion, that, defining, beauty, through, harmony, results, in, exchanging, one, unclear, term, for, another, one, some, attempts, have, been, made, to, dissolve, this, suspicion, by, searching, for, laws, of, beauty, like, the, golden, ratio, 18th, century, philosopher, alexander, baumgarten, for, example, saw, laws, of, beauty, in, analogy, with, laws, of, nature, and, believed, that, they, could, be, discovered, through, empirical, research, as, of, 2003, these, attempts, have, failed, to, find, a, general, definition, of, beauty, and, several, authors, take, the, opposite, claim, that, such, laws, cannot, be, formulated, as, part, of, their, definition, of, beauty, a, very, common, element, in, many, conceptions, of, beauty, is, its, relation, to, pleasure, hedonism, makes, this, relation, part, of, the, definition, of, beauty, by, holding, that, there, is, a, necessary, connection, between, pleasure, and, beauty, e, g, that, for, an, object, to, be, beautiful, is, for, it, to, cause, pleasure, or, that, the, experience, of, beauty, is, always, accompanied, by, pleasure, this, account, is, sometimes, labeled, as, aesthetic, hedonism, in, order, to, distinguish, it, from, other, forms, of, hedonism, an, influential, articulation, of, this, position, comes, from, thomas, aquinas, who, treats, beauty, as, that, which, pleases, in, the, very, apprehension, of, it, immanuel, kant, explains, this, pleasure, through, a, harmonious, interplay, between, the, faculties, of, understanding, and, imagination, a, further, question, for, hedonists, is, how, to, explain, the, relation, between, beauty, and, pleasure, this, problem, is, akin, to, the, euthyphro, dilemma, is, something, beautiful, because, we, enjoy, it, or, do, we, enjoy, it, because, it, is, beautiful, identity, theorists, solve, this, problem, by, denying, that, there, is, a, difference, between, beauty, and, pleasure, they, identify, beauty, or, the, appearance, of, it, with, the, experience, of, aesthetic, pleasure, hedonists, usually, restrict, and, specify, the, notion, of, pleasure, in, various, ways, in, order, to, avoid, obvious, counterexamples, one, important, distinction, in, this, context, is, the, difference, between, pure, and, mixed, pleasure, pure, pleasure, excludes, any, form, of, pain, or, unpleasant, feeling, while, the, experience, of, mixed, pleasure, can, include, unpleasant, elements, but, beauty, can, involve, mixed, pleasure, for, example, in, the, case, of, a, beautifully, tragic, story, which, is, why, mixed, pleasure, is, usually, allowed, in, hedonist, conceptions, of, beauty, another, problem, faced, by, hedonist, theories, is, that, we, take, pleasure, from, many, things, that, are, not, beautiful, one, way, to, address, this, issue, is, to, associate, beauty, with, a, special, type, of, pleasure, aesthetic, or, disinterested, pleasure, a, pleasure, is, disinterested, if, it, is, indifferent, to, the, existence, of, the, beautiful, object, or, if, it, did, not, arise, owing, to, an, antecedent, desire, through, means, end, reasoning, for, example, the, joy, of, looking, at, a, beautiful, landscape, would, still, be, valuable, if, it, turned, out, that, this, experience, was, an, illusion, which, would, not, be, true, if, this, joy, was, due, to, seeing, the, landscape, as, a, valuable, real, estate, opportunity, opponents, of, hedonism, usually, concede, that, many, experiences, of, beauty, are, pleasurable, but, deny, that, this, is, true, for, all, cases, for, example, a, cold, jaded, critic, may, still, be, a, good, judge, of, beauty, because, of, her, years, of, experience, but, lack, the, joy, that, initially, accompanied, her, work, one, way, to, avoid, this, objection, is, to, allow, responses, to, beautiful, things, to, lack, pleasure, while, insisting, that, all, beautiful, things, merit, pleasure, that, aesthetic, pleasure, is, the, only, appropriate, response, to, them, g, e, moore, explained, beauty, in, regard, to, intrinsic, value, as, that, of, which, the, admiring, contemplation, is, good, in, itself, this, definition, connects, beauty, to, experience, while, managing, to, avoid, some, of, the, problems, usually, associated, with, subjectivist, positions, since, it, allows, that, things, may, be, beautiful, even, if, they, are, never, experienced, another, subjectivist, theory, of, beauty, comes, from, george, santayana, who, suggested, that, we, project, pleasure, onto, the, things, we, call, beautiful, so, in, a, process, akin, to, a, category, mistake, one, treats, one, s, subjective, pleasure, as, an, objective, property, of, the, beautiful, thing, other, conceptions, include, defining, beauty, in, terms, of, a, loving, or, longing, attitude, toward, the, beautiful, object, or, in, terms, of, its, usefulness, or, function, in, 1871, functionalist, charles, darwin, explained, beauty, as, result, of, accumulative, sexual, selection, in, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, the, classical, greek, noun, that, best, translates, to, the, english, language, words, beauty, or, beautiful, was, kallos, and, the, adjective, was, kalos, this, is, also, translated, as, good, or, of, fine, quality, and, thus, has, a, broader, meaning, than, mere, physical, or, material, beauty, similarly, kallos, was, used, differently, from, the, english, word, beauty, in, that, it, first, and, foremost, applied, to, humans, and, bears, an, erotic, connotation, the, koine, greek, word, for, beautiful, was, h, raios, an, adjective, etymologically, coming, from, the, word, h, ra, meaning, hour, in, koine, greek, beauty, was, thus, associated, with, being, of, one, s, hour, thus, a, ripe, fruit, of, its, time, was, considered, beautiful, whereas, a, young, woman, trying, to, appear, older, or, an, older, woman, trying, to, appear, younger, would, not, be, considered, beautiful, in, attic, greek, h, raios, had, many, meanings, including, youthful, and, ripe, old, age, another, classical, term, in, use, to, describe, beauty, was, pulchrum, latin, beauty, for, ancient, thinkers, existed, both, in, form, which, is, the, material, world, as, it, is, and, as, embodied, in, the, spirit, which, is, the, world, of, mental, formations, greek, mythology, mentions, helen, of, troy, as, the, most, beautiful, woman, ancient, greek, architecture, is, based, on, this, view, of, symmetry, and, proportion, in, one, fragment, of, heraclitus, s, writings, fragment, 106, he, mentions, beauty, this, reads, to, god, all, things, are, beautiful, good, right, the, earliest, western, theory, of, beauty, can, be, found, in, the, works, of, early, greek, philosophers, from, the, pre, socratic, period, such, as, pythagoras, who, conceived, of, beauty, as, useful, for, a, moral, education, of, the, soul, he, wrote, of, how, people, experience, pleasure, when, aware, of, a, certain, type, of, formal, situation, present, in, reality, perceivable, by, sight, or, through, the, ear, and, discovered, the, underlying, mathematical, ratios, in, the, harmonic, scales, in, music, the, pythagoreans, conceived, of, the, presence, of, beauty, in, universal, terms, which, is, as, existing, in, a, cosmological, state, they, observed, beauty, in, the, heavens, they, saw, a, strong, connection, between, mathematics, and, beauty, in, particular, they, noted, that, objects, proportioned, according, to, the, golden, ratio, seemed, more, attractive, the, classical, concept, of, beauty, is, one, that, exhibits, perfect, proportion, wolfflin, in, this, context, the, concept, belonged, often, within, the, discipline, of, mathematics, an, idea, of, spiritual, beauty, emerged, during, the, classical, period, beauty, was, something, embodying, divine, goodness, while, the, demonstration, of, behaviour, which, might, be, classified, as, beautiful, from, an, inner, state, of, morality, which, is, aligned, to, the, good, the, writing, of, xenophon, shows, a, conversation, between, socrates, and, aristippus, socrates, discerned, differences, in, the, conception, of, the, beautiful, for, example, in, inanimate, objects, the, effectiveness, of, execution, of, design, was, a, deciding, factor, on, the, perception, of, beauty, in, something, by, the, account, of, xenophon, socrates, found, beauty, congruent, with, that, to, which, was, defined, as, the, morally, good, in, short, he, thought, beauty, coincident, with, the, good, beauty, is, a, subject, of, plato, in, his, work, symposium, in, the, work, the, high, priestess, diotima, describes, how, beauty, moves, out, from, a, core, singular, appreciation, of, the, body, to, outer, appreciations, via, loved, ones, to, the, world, in, its, state, of, culture, and, society, wright, in, other, words, diotoma, gives, to, socrates, an, explanation, of, how, love, should, begin, with, erotic, attachment, and, end, with, the, transcending, of, the, physical, to, an, appreciation, of, beauty, as, a, thing, in, itself, the, ascent, of, love, begins, with, one, s, own, body, then, secondarily, in, appreciating, beauty, in, another, s, body, thirdly, beauty, in, the, soul, which, cognates, to, beauty, in, the, mind, in, the, modern, sense, fourthly, beauty, in, institutions, laws, and, activities, fifthly, beauty, in, knowledge, the, sciences, and, finally, to, lastly, love, beauty, itself, which, translates, to, the, original, greek, language, term, as, auto, to, kalon, in, the, final, state, auto, to, kalon, and, truth, are, united, as, one, there, is, the, sense, in, the, text, concerning, love, and, beauty, they, both, co, exist, but, are, still, independent, or, in, other, words, mutually, exclusive, since, love, does, not, have, beauty, since, it, seeks, beauty, the, work, toward, the, end, provides, a, description, of, beauty, in, a, negative, sense, plato, also, discusses, beauty, in, his, work, phaedrus, and, identifies, alcibiades, as, beautiful, in, parmenides, he, considered, beauty, to, be, the, idea, form, above, all, other, ideas, platonic, thought, synthesized, beauty, with, the, divine, scruton, cited, konstan, states, plato, states, of, the, idea, of, beauty, of, it, the, idea, being, something, inviting, desirousness, c, f, seducing, and, promotes, an, intellectual, renunciation, c, f, denouncing, of, desire, for, alexander, nehamas, it, is, only, the, locating, of, desire, to, which, the, sense, of, beauty, exists, in, the, considerations, of, plato, aristotle, defines, beauty, in, metaphysics, as, having, order, symmetry, and, definiteness, which, the, mathematical, sciences, exhibit, to, a, special, degree, he, saw, a, relationship, between, the, beautiful, to, kalon, and, virtue, arguing, that, virtue, aims, at, the, beautiful, in, de, natura, deorum, cicero, wrote, the, splendour, and, beauty, of, creation, in, respect, to, this, and, all, the, facets, of, reality, resulting, from, creation, he, postulated, these, to, be, a, reason, to, see, the, existence, of, a, god, as, creator, in, the, middle, ages, catholic, philosophers, like, thomas, aquinas, included, beauty, among, the, transcendental, attributes, of, being, in, his, summa, theologica, aquinas, described, the, three, conditions, of, beauty, as, integritas, wholeness, consonantia, harmony, and, proportion, and, claritas, a, radiance, and, clarity, that, makes, the, form, of, a, thing, apparent, to, the, mind, in, the, gothic, architecture, of, the, high, and, late, middle, ages, light, was, considered, the, most, beautiful, revelation, of, god, which, was, heralded, in, design, examples, are, the, stained, glass, of, gothic, cathedrals, including, notre, dame, de, paris, and, chartres, cathedral, st, augustine, said, of, beauty, beauty, is, indeed, a, good, gift, of, god, but, that, the, good, may, not, think, it, a, great, good, god, dispenses, it, even, to, the, wicked, classical, philosophy, and, sculptures, of, men, and, women, produced, according, to, the, greek, philosophers, tenets, of, ideal, human, beauty, were, rediscovered, in, renaissance, europe, leading, to, a, re, adoption, of, what, became, known, as, a, classical, ideal, in, terms, of, female, human, beauty, a, woman, whose, appearance, conforms, to, these, tenets, is, still, called, a, classical, beauty, or, said, to, possess, a, classical, beauty, whilst, the, foundations, laid, by, greek, and, roman, artists, have, also, supplied, the, standard, for, male, beauty, and, female, beauty, in, western, civilization, as, seen, for, example, in, the, winged, victory, of, samothrace, during, the, gothic, era, the, classical, aesthetical, canon, of, beauty, was, rejected, as, sinful, later, renaissance, and, humanist, thinkers, rejected, this, view, and, considered, beauty, to, be, the, product, of, rational, order, and, harmonious, proportions, renaissance, artists, and, architects, such, as, giorgio, vasari, in, his, lives, of, artists, criticised, the, gothic, period, as, irrational, and, barbarian, this, point, of, view, of, gothic, art, lasted, until, romanticism, in, the, 19th, century, vasari, aligned, himself, to, the, classical, notion, and, thought, of, beauty, as, defined, as, arising, from, proportion, and, order, the, age, of, reason, saw, a, rise, in, an, interest, in, beauty, as, a, philosophical, subject, for, example, scottish, philosopher, francis, hutcheson, argued, that, beauty, is, unity, in, variety, and, variety, in, unity, he, wrote, that, beauty, was, neither, purely, subjective, nor, purely, objective, it, could, be, understood, not, as, any, quality, suppos, d, to, be, in, the, object, which, should, of, itself, be, beautiful, without, relation, to, any, mind, which, perceives, it, for, beauty, like, other, names, of, sensible, ideas, properly, denotes, the, perception, of, some, mind, however, we, generally, imagine, that, there, is, something, in, the, object, just, like, our, perception, immanuel, kant, believed, that, there, could, be, no, universal, criterion, of, the, beautiful, and, that, the, experience, of, beauty, is, subjective, but, that, an, object, is, judged, to, be, beautiful, when, it, seems, to, display, purposiveness, that, is, when, its, form, is, perceived, to, have, the, character, of, a, thing, designed, according, to, some, principle, and, fitted, for, a, purpose, he, distinguished, free, beauty, from, merely, adherent, beauty, explaining, that, the, first, presupposes, no, concept, of, what, the, object, ought, to, be, the, second, does, presuppose, such, a, concept, and, the, perfection, of, the, object, in, accordance, therewith, by, this, definition, free, beauty, is, found, in, seashells, and, wordless, music, adherent, beauty, in, buildings, and, the, human, body, the, romantic, poets, too, became, highly, concerned, with, the, nature, of, beauty, with, john, keats, arguing, in, ode, on, a, grecian, urn, that, in, the, romantic, period, edmund, burke, postulated, a, difference, between, beauty, in, its, classical, meaning, and, the, sublime, the, concept, of, the, sublime, as, explicated, by, burke, and, kant, suggested, viewing, gothic, art, and, architecture, though, not, in, accordance, with, the, classical, standard, of, beauty, as, sublime, the, 20th, century, saw, an, increasing, rejection, of, beauty, by, artists, and, philosophers, alike, culminating, in, postmodernism, s, anti, aesthetics, this, is, despite, beauty, being, a, central, concern, of, one, of, postmodernism, s, main, influences, friedrich, nietzsche, who, argued, that, the, will, to, power, was, the, will, to, beauty, in, the, aftermath, of, postmodernism, s, rejection, of, beauty, thinkers, have, returned, to, beauty, as, an, important, value, american, analytic, philosopher, guy, sircello, proposed, his, new, theory, of, beauty, as, an, effort, to, reaffirm, the, status, of, beauty, as, an, important, philosophical, concept, he, rejected, the, subjectivism, of, kant, and, sought, to, identify, the, properties, inherent, in, an, object, that, make, it, beautiful, he, called, qualities, such, as, vividness, boldness, and, subtlety, properties, of, qualitative, degree, pqds, and, stated, that, a, pqd, makes, an, object, beautiful, if, it, is, not, and, does, not, create, the, appearance, of, a, property, of, deficiency, lack, or, defect, and, if, the, pqd, is, strongly, present, in, the, object, elaine, scarry, argues, that, beauty, is, related, to, justice, beauty, is, also, studied, by, psychologists, and, neuroscientists, in, the, field, of, experimental, aesthetics, and, neuroesthetics, respectively, psychological, theories, see, beauty, as, a, form, of, pleasure, correlational, findings, support, the, view, that, more, beautiful, objects, are, also, more, pleasing, some, studies, suggest, that, higher, experienced, beauty, is, associated, with, activity, in, the, medial, orbitofrontal, cortex, this, approach, of, localizing, the, processing, of, beauty, in, one, brain, region, has, received, criticism, within, the, field, philosopher, and, novelist, umberto, eco, wrote, on, beauty, a, history, of, a, western, idea, 2004, and, on, ugliness, 2007, the,

the, ideal, image, and, are, perceived, as, more, attractive, this, was, first, noticed, in, 1883, when, francis, galton, overlaid, photographic, composite, images, of, the, faces, of, vegetarians, and, criminals, to, see, if, there, was, a, typical, facial, appearance, for, each, when, doing, this, he, noticed, that, the, composite, images, were, more, attractive, as, compared, to, any, of, the, individual, images, researchers, have, replicated, the, result, under, more, controlled, conditions, and, found, that, the, computer, generated, mathematical, average, of, a, series, of, faces, is, rated, more, favorably, than, individual, faces, it, is, argued, that, it, is, evolutionarily, advantageous, that, sexual, creatures, are, attracted, to, mates, who, possess, predominantly,

figures, were, more, fertile, than, other, women, because, of, higher, levels, of, certain, female, hormones, a, fact, that, may, subconsciously, condition, males, choosing, mates, in, 2008, other, commentators, have, suggested, that, this, preference, may, not, be, universal, for, instance, in, some, non, western, cultures, in, which, women, have, to, do, work, such, as, finding, food, men, tend, to, have, preferences, for, higher, waist, hip, ratios, exposure, to, the, thin, ideal, in, mass, media, such, as, fashion, magazines, directly, correlates, with, body, dissatisfaction, low,

among, young, girls, as, they, grow, highlighting, the, dangerous, nature, of, beauty, standards, in, society, a, study, using, chinese, immigrants, and, hispanic, black, and, white, american, citizens, found, that, their, ideals, of, female, beauty, were, not, significantly, different, participants, in, the, study, rated, asian, and, latina, women, as, more, attractive, than, white, and, black, women, and, it, was, found, that, asian, and, latina, women, had, more, of, the, attributes, that, were, considered, attractive, for, women, exposure, to, western, media, did, not, influence, or, improve, the, asian, men, s, ratings, of, white, women, one, study, found, that, east, asian, women, in, the, united, states, are, closer, to, the, ideal, figure, promoted, in, western, media, and, that, east, asian, women, conform, to, both, western, and, eastern, influences, in, the, united, states, east, asian, men, were, found, to, be, more, impacted, by, western, beauty, ideals, then,

white, western, women, were, found, to, have, the, highest, levels, of, body, dissatisfaction, in, the, united, states, a, study, of, african, american, and, south, asian, women, found, that, some, had, internalized, a, white, beauty, ideal, that, placed, light, skin, and, straight, hair, at, the, top, eurocentric, standards, for, men, include, tallness, leanness, and, muscularity, which, have, been, idolized, through, american, media, such, as, in, hollywood, films, and, magazine, covers, in, of, the, united, states, african, americans, have, historically, been, subjected, to, beauty, ideals, that, often, do, not, reflect, their, own, appearance, which, can, lead, to, issues, of, low, self, esteem, african, american, philosopher, cornel, west, elaborates, that, much, of, black, self, hatred, and, self, contempt, has, to, do, with, the, refusal, of, many, black, americans, to, love, their, own, black, bodies, especially, their, black, noses, hips, lips, and, hair, according,

concept, of, beauty, much, criticism, has, been, directed, at, models, of, beauty, which, depend, solely, upon, western, ideals, of, beauty, as, seen, for, example, in, the, barbie, franchise, criticisms, of, barbie, are, often, centered, around, concerns, that, children, consider, barbie, a, role, model, of, beauty, and, will, attempt, to, emulate, her, one, of, the, most, common, criticisms, of, barbie, is, that, she, promotes, an, unrealistic, idea, of, body, image, for, a, young, woman, leading, to, a, risk, that, girls, who, attempt, to, emulate, her, will, become, anorexic, as, of, 1998, these, criticisms, of, the, lack, of, diversity, in, such, franchises, as, the, barbie, model, of, beauty, in, western, culture, had, led, to, a, dialogue, to, create, non, exclusive, models, of, western, ideals, in, body, type, for, young, girls, who, do, not, match, the, thinness, ideal, that, barbie, represents, mattel, responded, to, these, criticisms, in, east, asian, cultures, familial, pressures, and, cultural, norms, shape, beauty, ideals, a, 2017, experimental, study, concluded, that, asian, cultural, idealization, of, fragile, girls, was, impacting, asian, american, women, s, lifestyle, eating, and, appearance, choices, researchers, have, found, that, good, looking, students, get, higher, grades, from, their, teachers, than, students, with, an, ordinary, appearance, some, studies, using, mock, criminal, trials, have, shown, that, physically, attractive, defendants, are, less, likely, to, be, convicted, and, if, convicted, are, likely, to, receive, lighter, sentences, than, less, attractive, ones, although, the, opposite, effect, was, observed, when, the, alleged, crime, was, swindling, perhaps, because, jurors, perceived, the, defendant, s, attractiveness, as, facilitating, the, crime, studies, among, teens, and, young, adults, such, as, those, of, psychiatrist, and, self, help, author, eva, ritvo, show, that, skin, conditions, have, a, profound, effect, on, social, behavior, and, opportunity, how, much, money, a, person, earns, may, also, be, influenced, by, physical, beauty, one, study, found, that, people, low, in, physical, attractiveness, earn, 5, to, 10, percent, less, than, ordinary, looking, people, who, in, turn, earn, 3, to, 8, percent, less, than, those, who, are, considered, good, looking, in, the, market, for, loans, the, least, attractive, people, are, less, likely, to, get, approvals, although, they, are, less, likely, to, default, in, the, marriage, market, women, s, looks, are, at, a, premium, but, men, s, looks, do, not, matter, much, the, impact, of, physical, attractiveness, on, earnings, varies, across, races, with, the, largest, beauty, wage, gap, among, black, women, and, black, men, conversely, being, very, unattractive, increases, the, individual, s, propensity, for, criminal, activity, for, a, number, of, crimes, ranging, from, burglary, to, theft, to, selling,
