multitude, of, apparent, individual, bodies, in, the, west, pantheism, was, formalized, as, a, separate, theology, and, philosophy, based, on, the, work, of, the, 17th, century, philosopher, baruch, spinoza, p, 7, spinoza, was, a, dutch, philosopher, of, portuguese, descent, raised, in, the, sephardi, jewish, community, in, amsterdam, he, developed, highly, controversial, ideas, regarding, the, authenticity, of, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, nature, of, the, divine, and, was, effectively, excluded, from, jewish, society, at, age, 23, when, the, local, synagogue, issued, a, herem, against, him, a, number, of, his, books, were, published, posthumously, and, shortly, thereafter, included, in, the, catholic, church, s, index, of, forbidden, books, in, the, posthumous, ethics, he, opposed, ren, descartes, famous, mind, body, dualism, the, theory, that, the, body, and, spirit, are, separate, spinoza, held, the, monist, view, that, the, two, are, the, same, and, monism, is, a, fundamental, part, of, his, philosophy, he, was, described, as, a, god, intoxicated, man, and, used, the, word, god, to, describe, the, unity, of, all, substance, this, view, influenced, philosophers, such, as, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, who, said, you, are, either, a, spinozist, or, not, a, philosopher, at, all, spinoza, earned, praise, as, one, of, the, great, rationalists, of, 17th, century, philosophy, and, one, of, western, philosophy, s, most, important, thinkers, although, the, term, pantheism, was, not, coined, until, after, his, death, he, is, regarded, as, the, most, celebrated, advocate, of, the, concept, ethics, was, the, major, source, from, which, western, pantheism, spread, the, first, known, use, of, the, term, pantheism, was, in, latin, pantheismus, by, the, english, mathematician, joseph, raphson, in, his, work, de, spatio, reali, seu, ente, infinito, published, in, 1697, raphson, begins, with, a, distinction, between, atheistic, panhylists, from, the, greek, roots, pan, all, and, hyle, matter, who, believe, everything, is, matter, and, spinozan, pantheists, who, believe, in, a, certain, universal, substance, material, as, well, as, intelligence, that, fashions, all, things, that, exist, out, of, its, own, essence, raphson, thought, that, the, universe, was, immeasurable, in, respect, to, a, human, s, capacity, of, understanding, and, believed, that, humans, would, never, be, able, to, comprehend, it, he, referred, to, the, pantheism, of, the, ancient, egyptians, persians, syrians, assyrians, greek, indians, and, jewish, kabbalists, specifically, referring, to, spinoza, the, term, was, first, used, in, english, by, a, translation, of, raphson, s, work, in, 1702, it, was, later, used, and, popularized, by, irish, writer, john, toland, in, his, work, of, 1705, socinianism, truly, stated, by, a, pantheist, pp, 617, 618, toland, was, influenced, by, both, spinoza, and, bruno, and, had, read, joseph, raphson, s, de, spatio, reali, referring, to, it, as, the, ingenious, mr, ralphson, s, sic, book, of, real, space, like, raphson, he, used, the, terms, pantheist, and, spinozist, interchangeably, in, 1720, he, wrote, the, pantheisticon, or, the, form, of, celebrating, the, socratic, society, in, latin, envisioning, a, pantheist, society, that, believed, all, things, in, the, world, are, one, and, one, is, all, in, all, things, what, is, all, in, all, things, is, god, eternal, and, immense, neither, born, nor, ever, to, perish, he, clarified, his, idea, of, pantheism, in, a, letter, to, gottfried, leibniz, in, 1710, when, he, referred, to, the, pantheistic, opinion, of, those, who, believe, in, no, other, eternal, being, but, the, universe, in, the, mid, eighteenth, century, the, english, theologian, daniel, waterland, defined, pantheism, this, way, it, supposes, god, and, nature, or, god, and, the, whole, universe, to, be, one, and, the, same, substance, one, universal, being, insomuch, that, men, s, souls, are, only, modifications, of, the, divine, substance, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, the, german, theologian, julius, wegscheider, defined, pantheism, as, the, belief, that, god, and, the, world, established, by, god, are, one, and, the, same, between, 1785, 89, a, controversy, about, spinoza, s, philosophy, arose, between, the, german, philosophers, friedrich, heinrich, jacobi, a, critic, and, moses, mendelssohn, a, defender, known, in, german, as, the, pantheismusstreit, pantheism, controversy, it, helped, spread, pantheism, to, many, german, thinkers, during, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, pantheism, was, the, viewpoint, of, many, leading, writers, and, philosophers, attracting, figures, such, as, william, wordsworth, and, samuel, coleridge, in, britain, johann, gottlieb, fichte, schelling, and, hegel, in, germany, knut, hamsun, in, norway, and, walt, whitman, ralph, waldo, emerson, and, henry, david, thoreau, in, the, united, states, seen, as, a, growing, threat, by, the, vatican, in, 1864, it, was, formally, condemned, by, pope, pius, ix, in, the, syllabus, of, errors, a, letter, written, in, 1886, by, william, herndon, abraham, lincoln, s, law, partner, was, sold, at, auction, for, us, 30, 000, in, 2011, in, it, herndon, writes, of, the, u, s, president, s, evolving, religious, views, which, included, pantheism, mr, lincoln, s, religion, is, too, well, known, to, me, to, allow, of, even, a, shadow, of, a, doubt, he, is, or, was, a, theist, and, a, rationalist, denying, all, extraordinary, supernatural, inspiration, or, revelation, at, one, time, in, his, life, to, say, the, least, he, was, an, elevated, pantheist, doubting, the, immortality, of, the, soul, as, the, christian, world, understands, that, term, he, believed, that, the, soul, lost, its, identity, and, was, immortal, as, a, force, subsequent, to, this, he, rose, to, the, belief, of, a, god, and, this, is, all, the, change, he, ever, underwent, the, subject, is, understandably, controversial, but, the, content, of, the, letter, is, consistent, with, lincoln, s, fairly, lukewarm, approach, to, organized, religion, some, 19th, century, theologians, thought, that, various, pre, christian, religions, and, philosophies, were, pantheistic, they, thought, pantheism, was, similar, to, the, ancient, hinduism, pp, 618, philosophy, of, advaita, non, dualism, 19th, century, european, theologians, also, considered, ancient, egyptian, religion, to, contain, pantheistic, elements, and, pointed, to, egyptian, philosophy, as, a, source, of, greek, pantheism, pp, 618, 620, the, latter, included, some, of, the, presocratics, such, as, heraclitus, and, anaximander, the, stoics, were, pantheists, beginning, with, zeno, of, citium, and, culminating, in, the, emperor, philosopher, marcus, aurelius, during, the, pre, christian, roman, empire, stoicism, was, one, of, the, three, dominant, schools, of, philosophy, along, with, epicureanism, and, neoplatonism, the, early, taoism, of, laozi, and, zhuangzi, is, also, sometimes, considered, pantheistic, although, it, could, be, more, similar, to, panentheism, cheondoism, which, arose, in, the, joseon, dynasty, of, korea, and, won, buddhism, are, also, considered, pantheistic, the, realist, society, of, canada, believes, that, the, consciousness, of, the, self, aware, universe, is, reality, which, is, an, alternative, view, of, pantheism, in, the, late, 20th, century, some, declared, that, pantheism, was, an, underlying, theology, of, neopaganism, and, pantheists, began, forming, organizations, devoted, specifically, to, pantheism, and, treating, it, as, a, separate, religion, dorion, sagan, son, of, scientist, and, science, communicator, carl, sagan,

his, father, believed, in, the, god, of, spinoza, and, einstein, god, not, behind, nature, but, as, nature, equivalent, to, it, in, 2009, pantheism, was, mentioned, in, a, papal, encyclical, and, in, a, statement, on, new, year, s, day, 2010, criticizing, pantheism, for, denying, the, superiority, of, humans, over, nature, and, seeing, the, source, of, man, s, salvation, in, nature, in, 2015, the,

other, examples, of, determinism, inclined, pantheisms, include, those, of, ralph, waldo, emerson, and, hegel, however, some, have, argued, against, treating, every, meaning, of, unity, as, an, aspect, of, pantheism, and, there, exist, versions, of, pantheism, that, regard, determinism, as, an, inaccurate, or, incomplete, view, of, nature, examples, include, the, beliefs, of, john, scotus, eriugena, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, schelling, and, william, james, it, may, also, be, possible, to, distinguish, two, types, of, pantheism, one, being, more, religious, and, the, other, being, more, philosophical, the, columbia, encyclopedia, writes, of, the, distinction, philosophers, and, theologians, have, often, suggested, that, pantheism, implies, monism, in, 1896, j, h, worman, a,

paul, d, feinberg, professor, of, biblical, and, systematic, theology, at, trinity, evangelical, divinity, school, also, identified, seven, hylozoistic, immanentistic, absolutistic, monistic, relativistic, monistic, acosmic, identity, of, opposites, and, neoplatonic, or, emanationistic, according, to, censuses, of, 2011, the, uk, was, the, country, with, the, most, pantheists, as, of, 2011, about, 1, 000, canadians, identified, their, religion, as, pantheist, representing, 0, 003, of, the, population, by, 2021, the, number, of, canadian, pantheists, had, risen, to, 1, 855, 0, 005, in, ireland, pantheism, rose, from, 202, in, 1991, to, 1106, in, 2002, to, 1, 691, in, 2006, 1, 940, in, 2011, in, new, zealand, there, was, exactly, one, pantheist, man, in, 1901, by, 1906, the, number, of, pantheists, in, new, zealand, had, septupled, to, 7, 6, male, 1, female, this, number, had, further, risen, to, 366, by, 2006, the, 2021, canadian, census, showed, that, pantheists, were, somewhat, more, likely, to, be, in, their, 20s, and, 30s, compared, to, the, general, population, people, under, 15, were, about, four, times, less, likely, to, be, pantheist, than, the, general, population, the, 2021, canadian, census, also, showed, that, pantheists, were, less, likely, to, be, part, of, a, recognized, minority, group, compared, to, the, general, population, with, 90, 3, of, pantheists, not, being, part, of, any, minority, group, compared, to, 73, 5, of, the, general, population, the, census, did, not, register, any, pantheists, who, were, arab, southeast, asian, west, asian, korean, or, japanese, in, canada, 2011, there, was, no, gender, difference, in, regards, to, pantheism, however, in, ireland, 2011, pantheists, were, slightly, more, likely, to, be, female,

representing, 51, 5, of, pantheists, nature, worship, or, nature, mysticism, is, often, conflated, and, confused, with, pantheism, it, is, pointed, out, by, at, least, one, expert, harold, wood, founder, of, the, universal, pantheist, society, that, in, pantheist, philosophy, spinoza, s, identification, of, god, with, nature, is, very, different, from, a, recent, idea, of, a, self, identifying, pantheist, with, environmental, ethical, concerns, his, use, of, the, word, nature, to, describe, his, worldview, may, be, vastly, different, from, the, nature, of, modern, sciences, he, and, other, nature, mystics, who, also, identify, as, pantheists, use, nature, to, refer, to, the, limited, natural, environment, as, opposed, to, man, made, built, environment, this, use, of, nature, is, different, from, the, broader, use, from, spinoza, and, other, pantheists, describing, natural, laws, and, the, overall, phenomena, of, the, physical, world, nature, mysticism, may, be, compatible, with, pantheism, but, it, may, also, be, compatible, with, theism, and, other, views, pantheism, has, also, been, involved, in, animal, worship, especially, in, primal, religions, nontheism, is, an, umbrella, term, which, has, been, used, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, religions, not, fitting, traditional, theism, and, under, which, pantheism, has, been, included, panentheism, from, greek, p, n, all, en, in, and, the, s, god, all, in, god, was, formally, coined, in, germany, in, the, 19th, century, in, an, attempt, to, offer, a, philosophical, synthesis, between, traditional, theism, and, pantheism, stating, that, god, is, substantially, omnipresent, in, the, physical, universe, but, also, exists, apart, from, or, beyond, it, as, its, creator, and, sustainer, p, 27, thus, panentheism, separates, itself, from, pantheism, positing, the, extra, claim, that, god, exists, above, and, beyond, the, world, as, we, know, it, the, line, between, pantheism, and, panentheism, can, be, blurred, depending, on, varying, definitions, of, god, so, there, have, been, disagreements, when, assigning, particular, notable, figures, to, pantheism, or, panentheism, pp, 71, 72, 87, 88, 105, pandeism, is, another, word, derived, from, pantheism, and, is, characterized, as, a, combination, of, reconcilable, elements, of, pantheism, and, deism, it, assumes, a, creator, deity, that, is, at, some, point, distinct, from, the, universe, and, then, transforms, into, it, resulting, in, a, universe, similar, to, the, pantheistic, one, in, present, essence, but, differing, in, origin, panpsychism, is, the, philosophical, view, that, consciousness, mind, or, soul, is, a, universal, feature, of, all, things, some, pantheists, also, subscribe, to, the, distinct, philosophical, views, hylozoism, or, panvitalism, the, view, that, everything, is, alive, and, its, close, neighbor, animism, the, view, that, everything, has, a, soul, or, spirit, many, traditional, and, folk, religions, including, african, traditional, religions, and, native, american, religions, can, be, seen, as, pantheistic, or, a, mixture, of, pantheism, and, other, doctrines, such, as, polytheism, and, animism, according, to, pantheists, there, are, elements, of, pantheism, in, some, forms, of, christianity, ideas, resembling, pantheism, existed, in, eastern, religions, before, the, 18th, century, notably, hinduism, confucianism, and, taoism, although, there, is, no, evidence, that, these, influenced, spinoza, s, work, there, is, such, evidence, regarding, other, contemporary, philosophers, such, as, leibniz, and, later, voltaire, in, the, case, of, hinduism, pantheistic, views, exist, alongside, panentheistic, polytheistic, monotheistic, and, atheistic, ones, pantheism, is, popular, in, modern, spirituality, and, new, religious, movements, such, as, neopaganism, and, theosophy, two, organizations, that, specify, the, word, pantheism, in, their, title, formed, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, the, universal, pantheist, society, open, to, all, varieties, of, pantheists, and, supportive, of, environmental, causes, was, founded, in, 1975, the, world, pantheist, movement, is, headed, by, paul, harrison, an, environmentalist, writer, and, a, former, vice, president, of, the, universal, pantheist, society, from, which, he, resigned, in, 1996, the, world, pantheist, movement, was, incorporated, in, 1999, to, focus, exclusively, on, promoting, naturalistic, pantheism, a, strict, metaphysical, naturalistic, version, of, pantheism, considered, by, some, a, form, of, religious, naturalism, it, has, been, described, as, an, example, of, dark, green, religion, with, a, focus, on, environmental, ethics, category
