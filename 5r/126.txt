belief, in, a, supernatural, reality, or, any, divine, being, nevertheless, many, humanists, e, g, bertrand, russell, jean, paul, sartre, who, clearly, value, the, non, material, communal, and, virtuous, aspects, of, life, reject, this, usage, of, the, term, spirituality, as, being, overly, broad, i, e, it, effectively, amounts, to, saying, everything, and, anything, that, is, good, and, virtuous, is, necessarily, spiritual, in, 1930, russell, a, self, described, agnostic, renowned, as, an, atheist, wrote, one, s, ego, is, no, very, large, part, of, the, world, the, man, who, can, centre, his, thoughts, and, hopes, upon, something, transcending, self, can, find, a, certain, peace, in, the, ordinary, troubles, of, life, which, is, impossible, to, the, pure, egoist, similarly, aristotle, one, of, the, first, known, western, thinkers, to, demonstrate, that, morality, virtue, and, goodness, can, be, derived, without, appealing, to, supernatural, forces, argued, that, men, create, gods, in, their, own, image, not, the, other, way, around, moreover, theistic, and, atheistic, critics, alike, dismiss, the, need, for, the, secular, spirituality, label, on, the, basis, that, it, appears, to, be, nothing, more, than, obscurantism, in, that, although, personal, well, being, both, physical, and, psychological, is, said, to, be, an, important, aspect, of, modern, spirituality, this, does, not, imply, spirituality, is, essential, to, achieving, happiness, e, g, see, archived, 2015, 10, 13, at, the, wayback, machine, free, thinkers, who, reject, notions, that, the, numinous, or, non, material, is, important, to, living, well, can, be, just, as, happy, as, more, spiritually, oriented, individuals, see, contemporary, proponents, of, spirituality, may, suggest, that, spirituality, develops, inner, peace, and, forms, a, foundation, for, happiness, for, example, meditation, and, similar, practices, are, suggested, to, help, the, practitioner, cultivate, a, personal, inner, life, and, character, ellison, and, fan, 2008, assert, that, spirituality, causes, a, wide, array, of, positive, health, outcomes, including, morale, happiness, and, life, satisfaction, however, schuurmans, stekhoven, 2013, actively, attempted, to, replicate, this, research, and, found, more, mixed, results, nevertheless, spirituality, has, played, a, central, role, in, some, self, help, movements, such, as, alcoholics, anonymous, if, an, alcoholic, failed, to, perfect, and, enlarge, his, spiritual, life, through, work, and, self, sacrifice, for, others, he, could, not, survive, the, certain, trials, and, low, spots, ahead, such, spiritually, informed, treatment, approaches, have, been, challenged, as, pseudoscience, spiritual, experiences, play, a, central, role, in, modern, spirituality, both, western, and, asian, authors, have, popularised, this, notion, important, early, 20th, century, western, writers, who, studied, the, phenomenon, of, spirituality, and, their, works, include, william, james, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, 1902, and, rudolph, otto, especially, the, idea, of, the, holy, 1917, james, notions, of, spiritual, experience, had, a, further, influence, on, the, modernist, streams, in, asian, traditions, making, them, even, further, recognisable, for, a, western, audience, william, james, popularized, the, use, of, the, term, religious, experience, in, his, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, he, has, also, influenced, the, understanding, of, mysticism, as, a, distinctive, experience, which, allegedly, grants, knowledge, wayne, proudfoot, traces, the, roots, of, the, notion, of, religious, experience, further, back, to, the, german, theologian, friedrich, schleiermacher, 1768, 1834, who, argued, that, religion, is, based, on, a, feeling, of, the, infinite, schleiermacher, used, the, idea, of, religious, experience, to, defend, religion, against, the, growing, scientific, and, secular, critique, many, scholars, of, religion, of, whom, william, james, was, the, most, influential, adopted, the, concept, major, asian, influences, on, contemporary, spirituality, have, included, swami, vivekananda, 1863, 1902, and, d, t, suzuki, 1870, 1966, vivekananda, popularised, a, modern, syncretic, hinduism, in, which, an, emphasis, on, personal, experience, replaced, the, authority, of, scriptures, suzuki, had, a, major, influence, on, the, popularisation, of, zen, in, the, west, and, popularized, the, idea, of, enlightenment, as, insight, into, a, timeless, transcendent, reality, other, influences, came, through, paul, brunton, s, a, search, in, secret, india, 1934, which, introduced, ramana, maharshi, 1879, 1950, and, meher, baba, 1894, 1969, to, a, western, audience, spiritual, experiences, can, include, being, connected, to, a, larger, reality, yielding, a, more, comprehensive, self, joining, with, other, individuals, or, the, human, community, with, nature, or, the, cosmos, or, with, the, divine, realm, kees, waaijman, discerns, four, forms, of, spiritual, practices, spiritual, practices, may, include, meditation, mindfulness, prayer, the, contemplation, of, sacred, texts, ethical, development, and, spiritual, retreats, in, a, convent, love, and, or, compassion, are, often, described, as, the, mainstay, of, spiritual, development, within, spirituality, is, also, found, a, common, emphasis, on, the, value, of, thoughtfulness, tolerance, for, breadth, and, practices, and, beliefs, and, appreciation, for, the, insights, of, other, religious, communities, as, well, as, other, sources, of, authority, within, the, social, sciences, various, studies, most, originating, from, north, america, have, reported, a, positive, correlation, between, spirituality, and, mental, well, being, in, both, healthy, people, and, those, encountering, a, range, of, physical, illnesses, or, psychological, disorders, although, spiritual, individuals, tend, to, be, optimistic, report, greater, social, support, and, experience, higher, intrinsic, meaning, in, life, strength, and, inner, peace, whether, the, correlation, represents, a, causal, link, remains, contentious, both, supporters, and, opponents, of, this, claim, agree, that, past, statistical, findings, are, difficult, to, interpret, in, large, part, because, of, the, ongoing, disagreement, over, how, spirituality, should, be, defined, and, measured, there, is, also, evidence, that, an, agreeable, positive, temperament, and, or, a, tendency, toward, sociability, which, all, correlate, with, spirituality, might, actually, be, the, key, psychological, features, that, predispose, people, to, subsequently, adopt, a, spiritual, orientation, and, that, these, characteristics, not, spiritually, per, se, add, to, well, being, there, is, also, some, suggestion, that, the, benefits, associated, with, spirituality, and, religiosity, might, arise, from, being, a, member, of, a, close, knit, community, social, bonds, available, via, secular, sources, i, e, not, unique, to, spirituality, or, faith, based, groups, might, just, as, effectively, raise, well, being, in, sum, spirituality, may, not, be, the, active, ingredient, i, e, past, association, with, psychological, well, being, measures, might, reflect, a, reverse, causation, or, effects, from, other, variables, that, correlate, with, spirituality, and, that, the, effects, of, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or, virtue, personality, traits, common, in, many, non, spiritual, people, yet, known, to, be, slightly, more, common, among, the, spiritual, may, better, account, for, spirituality, s, apparent, correlation, with, mental, health, and, social, support, masters, and, spielmans, conducted, a, meta, analysis, of, all, the, available, and, reputable, research, examining, the, effects, of, distant, intercessory, prayer, they, found, no, discernible, health, effects, from, being, prayed, for, by, others, in, fact, one, large, and, scientifically, rigorous, study, by, herbert, benson, and, colleagues, revealed, that, intercessory, prayer, had, no, effect, on, recovery, from, cardiac, arrest, but, patients, told, people, were, praying, for, them, actually, had, an, increased, risk, of, medical, complications, in, the, health, care, professions, there, is, growing, interest, in, spiritual, care, to, complement, the, medical, technical, approaches, and, to, improve, the, outcomes, of, medical, treatments, puchalski, et, al, argue, for, compassionate, systems, of, care, in, a, spiritual, context, neuroscientists, have, examined, brain, functioning, during, reported, spiritual, experiences, finding, that, certain, neurotransmitters, and, specific, areas, of, the, brain, are, involved, moreover, experimenters, have, also, successfully, induced, spiritual, experiences, in, individuals, by, administering, psychoactive, agents, known, to, elicit, euphoria, and, perceptual, distortions, conversely, religiosity, and, spirituality, can, also, be, dampened, by, electromagnetic, stimulation, of, the, brain, these, results, have, motivated, some, leading, theorists, to, speculate, that, spirituality, may, be, a, benign, subtype, of, psychosis, benign, in, the, sense, that, the, same, aberrant, sensory, perceptions, that, those, suffering, clinical, psychoses, evaluate, as, distressingly, incongruent, and, inexplicable, are, instead, interpreted, by, spiritual, individuals, as, positive, personal, and, meaningful, transcendent, experiences, considerable, debate, persists, about, among, other, factors, spirituality, s, relation, to, religion, the, number, and, content, of, its, dimensions, its, relation, to, concepts, of, well, being, and, its, universality, a, number, of, research, groups, have, developed, instruments, which, attempt, to, measure, spirituality, quantitatively, including, unidimensional, e, g, the, character, strength, inventory, spirituality, and, the, daily, spiritual, experiences, scale, and, multi, dimensional, e, g, spiritual, transcendence, scale, sts, and, the, brief, multidimensional, measure, of, religiousness, spirituality, bmmrs, scales, macdonald, et, al, gave, an, expressions, of, spirituality, inventory, esi, r, measuring, five, dimensions, of,
