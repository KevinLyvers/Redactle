religion, portal, buddhist, philosophy, is, the, ancient, indian, philosophical, system, that, developed, within, the, religio, philosophical, tradition, of, buddhism, it, comprises, all, the, philosophical, investigations, and, systems, of, rational, inquiry, that, developed, among, various, schools, of, buddhism, in, ancient, india, following, the, parinirv, a, of, gautama, buddha, c, 5th, century, bce, as, well, as, the, further, developments, which, followed, the, spread, of, buddhism, throughout, asia, buddhism, combines, both, philosophical, reasoning, and, the, practice, of, meditation, the, buddhist, religion, presents, a, multitude, of, buddhist, paths, to, liberation, with, the, expansion, of, early, buddhism, from, ancient, india, to, sri, lanka, and, subsequently, to, east, asia, and, southeast, asia, buddhist, thinkers, have, covered, topics, as, varied, as, cosmology, ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics, ontology, phenomenology, the, philosophy, of, mind, the, philosophy, of, time, and, soteriology, in, their, analysis, of, these, paths, pre, sectarian, buddhism, was, based, on, empirical, evidence, gained, by, the, sense, organs, including, the, mind, and, the, buddha, seems, to, have, retained, a, skeptical, distance, from, certain, metaphysical, questions, refusing, to, answer, them, because, they, were, not, conducive, to, liberation, but, led, instead, to, further, speculation, however, he, also, affirmed, theories, with, metaphysical, implications, such, as, dependent, arising, karma, and, rebirth, particular, points, of, buddhist, philosophy, have, often, been, the, subject, of, disputes, between, different, schools, of, buddhism, as, well, as, between, representative, thinkers, of, buddhist, schools, and, hindu, or, jaina, philosophers, these, elaborations, and, disputes, gave, rise, to, various, early, buddhist, schools, of, abhidharma, the, mah, y, na, movement, and, scholastic, traditions, such, as, praj, p, ramit, sarv, stiv, da, m, dhyamaka, sautr, ntika, vaibh, ika, buddha, nature, yog, c, ra, and, more, one, recurrent, theme, in, buddhist, philosophy, has, been, the, desire, to, find, a, middle, way, between, philosophical, views, seen, as, extreme, edward, conze, splits, the, development, of, indian, buddhist, philosophy, into, three, phases, various, elements, of, these, three, phases, are, incorporated, and, or, further, developed, in, the, philosophy, and, worldview, of, the, various, sects, of, buddhism, that, then, emerged, philosophy, in, ancient, india, was, aimed, mainly, at, spiritual, liberation, and, had, soteriological, goals, in, his, study, of, the, m, dhyamaka, and, sautr, ntika, schools, of, buddhist, philosophy, in, ancient, india, peter, deller, santina, writes, attention, must, first, of, all, be, drawn, to, the, fact, that, philosophical, systems, in, india, were, seldom, if, ever, purely, speculative, or, descriptive, virtually, all, the, great, philosophical, systems, of, india, s, khya, advaita, ved, nta, m, dhyamaka, and, so, forth, were, preeminently, concerned, with, providing, a, means, to, liberation, or, salvation, it, was, a, tacit, assumption, with, these, systems, that, if, their, philosophy, were, correctly, understood, and, assimilated, an, unconditioned, state, free, of, suffering, and, limitation, could, be, achieved, if, this, fact, is, overlooked, as, often, happens, as, a, result, of, the, propensity, engendered, by, formal, occidental, philosophy, to, consider, the, philosophical, enterprise, as, a, purely, descriptive, one, the, real, significance, of, indian, and, buddhist, philosophy, will, be, missed, for, the, indian, buddhist, philosophers, the, teachings, of, gautama, buddha, were, not, meant, to, be, taken, on, faith, alone, but, to, be, confirmed, by, logical, analysis, and, inquiry, pram, a, of, the, world, the, early, buddhist, texts, mention, that, a, person, becomes, a, follower, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, after, having, pondered, them, over, with, wisdom, and, the, gradual, training, also, requires, that, a, disciple, investigate, upaparikkhati, and, scrutinize, tuleti, the, teachings, the, buddha, also, expected, his, disciples, to, approach, him, as, a, teacher, in, a, critical, fashion, and, scrutinize, his, actions, and, words, as, shown, in, the, v, ma, saka, sutta, some, buddhist, thinkers, even, argued, that, rational, reflection, and, philosophical, analysis, was, a, central, practice, which, was, necessary, for, the, attainment, of, insight, in, meditation, thus, mahayana, philosophers, like, praj, akaragupta, argue, that, one, is, not, a, yogi, merely, because, of, meditation, rather, one, must, meditate, listen, to, the, teachings, and, understand, them, by, reflecting, through, rational, inquiry, yukti, cint, maya, only, through, this, method, which, combined, rational, reflection, and, meditation, will, the, wisdom, that, leads, to, enlightenment, arise, scholarly, opinion, varies, as, to, whether, gautama, buddha, himself, was, engaged, in, philosophical, inquiry, siddartha, gautama, c, 5th, century, bce, was, a, north, indian, rama, a, wandering, ascetic, whose, teachings, are, preserved, in, the, p, li, nikayas, and, in, the, gamas, as, well, as, in, other, surviving, fragmentary, textual, collections, collectively, known, as, the, early, buddhist, texts, dating, these, texts, is, difficult, and, there, is, disagreement, on, how, much, of, this, material, goes, back, to, a, single, religious, founder, while, the, focus, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, is, about, attaining, the, highest, good, of, nirv, a, they, also, contain, an, analysis, of, the, source, of, human, suffering, du, kha, the, nature, of, personal, identity, tman, and, the, process, of, acquiring, knowledge, praj, a, about, the, world, the, buddha, defined, his, teaching, as, the, middle, way, p, li, majjhim, pa, ipad, in, the, dharmacakrapravartana, s, tra, this, is, used, to, refer, to, the, fact, that, his, teachings, steer, a, middle, course, between, the, extremes, of, asceticism, and, bodily, denial, as, practiced, by, the, jains, and, other, indian, ascetic, groups, and, sensual, hedonism, or, indulgence, many, rama, a, ascetics, of, the, buddha, s, time, placed, much, emphasis, on, a, denial, of, the, body, using, practices, such, as, fasting, to, liberate, the, mind, from, the, body, gautama, buddha, however, realized, that, the, mind, was, embodied, and, causally, dependent, on, the, body, and, therefore, that, a, malnourished, body, did, not, allow, the, mind, to, be, trained, and, developed, thus, buddhism, s, main, concern, is, not, with, luxury, or, poverty, but, instead, with, the, human, response, to, circumstances, another, related, teaching, of, the, historical, buddha, is, the, teaching, through, the, middle, majjhena, dhamma, desana, which, claims, to, be, a, metaphysical, middle, path, between, the, extremes, of, eternalism, and, annihilationism, as, well, as, the, extremes, of, existence, and, non, existence, this, idea, would, become, central, to, later, buddhist, metaphysics, as, all, buddhist, philosophies, would, claim, to, steer, a, metaphysical, middle, course, apart, from, the, middle, way, certain, basic, teachings, appear, in, many, places, throughout, these, early, buddhist, texts, so, older, studies, by, various, scholars, conclude, that, the, buddha, must, at, least, have, taught, some, of, these, key, teachings, according, to, n, ross, reat, all, of, these, doctrines, are, shared, by, the, p, li, canon, of, therav, da, buddhism, and, the, listamba, s, tra, belonging, to, the, mah, s, ghika, school, a, recent, study, by, bhikkhu, analayo, concludes, that, the, therav, din, majjhima, nik, ya, and, the, sarv, stiv, din, madhyama, gama, contain, mostly, the, same, major, buddhist, doctrines, richard, g, salomon, in, his, study, of, the, gandh, ran, buddhist, texts, which, are, the, earliest, manuscripts, containing, discourses, attributed, to, gautama, buddha, has, confirmed, that, their, teachings, are, consistent, with, non, mahayana, buddhism, which, survives, today, in, the, theravada, school, of, sri, lanka, and, southeast, asia, but, which, in, ancient, times, was, represented, by, eighteen, separate, schools, however, some, scholars, such, as, schmithausen, vetter, and, bronkhorst, argue, that, critical, analysis, reveals, discrepancies, among, these, various, doctrines, they, present, alternative, possibilities, for, what, was, taught, in, earliest, buddhism, and, question, the, authenticity, of, certain, teachings, and, doctrines, for, example, some, scholars, think, that, the, doctrine, of, karma, was, not, central, to, the, teachings, of, the, historical, buddha, while, others, disagree, with, this, position, likewise, there, is, scholarly, disagreement, on, whether, insight, into, the, true, nature, of, reality, praj, a, was, seen, as, liberating, in, earliest, buddhism, or, whether, it, was, a, later, addition, according, to, vetter, and, bronkhorst, dhy, na, constituted, the, original, liberating, practice, while, discriminating, insight, into, transiency, as, a, separate, path, to, liberation, was, a, later, development, scholars, such, as, bronkhorst, and, carol, anderson, also, think, that, the, four, noble, truths, may, not, have, been, formulated, in, earliest, buddhism, but, as, anderson, writes, emerged, as, a, central, teaching, in, a, slightly, later, period, that, still, preceded, the, final, redactions, of, the, various, buddhist, canons, according, to, some, scholars, the, philosophical, outlook, of, earliest, buddhism, was, primarily, negative, in, the, sense, that, it, focused, on, what, doctrines, to, reject, and, let, go, of, more, than, on, what, doctrines, to, accept, only, knowledge, that, is, useful, in, attaining, liberation, is, valued, according, to, this, theory, the, cycle, of, philosophical, upheavals, that, in, part, drove, the, diversification, of, buddhism, into, its, many, schools, and, sects, only, began, once, buddhists, began, attempting, to, make, explicit, the, implicit, philosophy, of, the, buddha, and, the, early, texts, the, four, noble, truths, or, truths, of, the, noble, one, are, a, central, feature, to, the, teachings, of, the, historical, buddha, and, are, put, forth, in, the, dharmacakrapravartana, s, tra, the, first, truth, of, du, kha, often, translated, as, suffering, is, the, inherent, and, eternal, unsatisfactoriness, of, life, this, unpleasantness, is, said, to, be, not, just, physical, pain, and, psychological, distress, but, also, a, kind, of, existential, unease, caused, by, the, inevitable, facts, of, our, mortality, and, ultimately, by, the, impermanence, of, all, beings, and, phenomena, suffering, also, arises, because, of, contact, with, unpleasant, events, and, due, to, not, getting, what, one, desires, the, second, truth, is, that, this, unease, arises, out, of, conditions, mainly, craving, ta, h, and, ignorance, avidy, the, third, truth, is, then, the, fact, that, whenever, sentient, beings, let, go, of, craving, and, remove, ignorance, through, insight, and, knowledge, suffering, ceases, nirodh, the, fourth, truth, is, the, noble, eightfold, path, which, consists, of, eight, practices, that, end, suffering, they, are, right, view, right, intention, right, speech, right, action, right, livelihood, right, effort, right, mindfulness, and, right, sam, dhi, concentration, mental, unification, meditation, the, highest, good, and, ultimate, goal, taught, by, the, historical, buddha, which, is, the, attainment, of, nirv, a, literally, means, extinguishing, and, signified, the, complete, extinguishing, of, greed, hatred, and, delusion, i, e, ignorance, the, forces, which, power, sa, s, ra, nirv, a, also, means, that, after, an, enlightened, being, s, death, there, is, no, further, rebirth, in, earliest, buddhism, the, concept, of, dependent, origination, prat, tya, samutp, da, was, most, likely, limited, to, processes, of, mental, conditioning, and, not, to, all, physical, phenomena, gautama, buddha, understood, the, world, in, procedural, terms, not, in, terms, of, things, or, substances, his, theory, posits, a, flux, of, events, arising, under, certain, conditions, which, are, interconnected, and, dependent, such, that, the, processes, in, question, at, no, time, are, considered, to, be, static, or, independent, craving, ta, h, for, example, is, always, dependent, on, and, caused, by, sensations, gained, by, the, sense, organs, yatana, sensations, are, always, dependent, on, contact, with, our, surroundings, buddha, s, causal, theory, is, simply, descriptive, this, existing, that, exists, this, arising, that, arises, this, not, existing, that, does, not, exist, this, ceasing, that, ceases, this, understanding, of, causation, as, impersonal, lawlike, causal, ordering, is, important, because, it, shows, how, the, processes, that, give, rise, to, suffering, work, and, also, how, they, can, be, reversed, the, removal, of, suffering, that, stemmed, from, ignorance, avidy, then, requires, a, deep, understanding, of, the, nature, of, reality, praj, a, while, philosophical, analysis, of, arguments, and, concepts, is, clearly, necessary, to, develop, this, understanding, it, is, not, enough, to, remove, our, unskillful, mental, habits, and, deeply, ingrained, prejudices, which, require, meditation, paired, with, understanding, according, to, the, buddha, s, teachings, as, recorded, in, the, gandh, ran, buddhist, texts, we, need, to, train, the, mind, in, meditation, to, be, able, to, truly, comprehend, the, nature, of, reality, which, is, said, to, have, the, three, marks, of, existence, suffering, impermanence, and, non, self, an, tman, understanding, and, meditation, are, said, to, work, together, to, clearly, see, vipassan, the, nature, of, human, experience, and, this, is, said, to, lead, to, liberation, gautama, buddha, argued, that, compounded, entities, and, sentient, beings, lacked, essence, correspondingly, the, self, is, without, essence, an, tman, this, means, there, is, no, part, of, a, person, which, is, unchanging, and, essential, for, continuity, and, it, means, that, there, is, no, individual, part, of, the, person, that, accounts, for, the, identity, of, that, person, over, time, this, is, in, opposition, to, the, upanishadic, concept, of, an, unchanging, ultimate, self, tman, and, any, view, of, an, eternal, soul, the, buddha, held, that, attachment, to, the, appearance, of, a, permanent, self, in, this, world, of, change, is, the, cause, of, suffering, du, kha, and, the, main, obstacle, to, the, attainment, of, spiritual, liberation, mok, a, the, most, widely, used, argument, that, the, buddha, employed, against, the, idea, of, an, unchanging, ego, is, an, empiricist, one, based, on, the, observation, of, the, five, aggregates, of, existence, skandh, that, constitute, a, sentient, being, and, the, fact, that, these, are, always, changing, this, argument, can, be, put, in, this, way, this, argument, requires, the, implied, premise, that, the, five, aggregates, are, an, exhaustive, account, of, what, makes, up, a, person, or, else, the, self, could, exist, outside, of, these, aggregates, this, premise, is, affirmed, in, other, buddhist, texts, such, as, sa, yutta, nik, ya, 22, 47, which, states, whatever, ascetics, and, brahmins, regard, various, kinds, of, things, as, self, all, regard, the, five, grasping, aggregates, or, one, of, them, this, argument, is, famously, expounded, in, the, an, tmalak, a, a, s, tra, according, to, this, text, the, apparently, fixed, self, is, merely, the, result, of, identification, with, the, temporary, aggregates, of, existence, skandh, the, changing, processes, making, up, an, individual, human, being, in, this, view, a, person, is, only, a, convenient, nominal, designation, on, a, certain, grouping, of, processes, and, characteristics, and, an, individual, is, a, conceptual, construction, overlaid, upon, a, stream, of, experiences, just, like, a, chariot, is, merely, a, conventional, designation, for, the, parts, of, a, chariot, and, how, they, are, put, together, the, foundation, of, this, argument, is, purely, empiricist, for, it, is, based, on, the, fact, that, all, we, observe, is, subject, to, change, especially, everything, observed, when, looking, inwardly, in, meditation, another, argument, supporting, the, doctrine, of, non, self, the, argument, from, lack, of, control, is, based, on, the, fact, that, we, often, seek, to, change, certain, parts, of, ourselves, that, the, executive, function, of, the, mind, is, that, which, finds, certain, things, unsatisfactory, and, attempts, to, alter, them, furthermore, it, is, also, based, on, the, anti, reflexivity, principle, of, indian, philosophy, which, states, an, entity, cannot, operate, on, or, control, itself, a, knife, can, cut, other, things, but, not, itself, a, finger, can, point, at, other, things, but, not, at, itself, etc, this, means, then, that, the, self, could, never, desire, to, change, itself, and, could, not, do, so, another, reason, for, this, is, that, besides, buddhism, in, the, orthodox, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, the, unchanging, ultimate, self, tman, is, perfectly, blissful, and, does, not, suffer, the, historical, buddha, used, this, idea, to, attack, the, concept, of, self, this, argument, could, be, structured, thus, this, argument, then, denies, that, there, is, one, permanent, controller, in, the, person, instead, it, views, the, person, as, a, set, of, constantly, changing, processes, which, include, volitional, events, seeking, change, and, an, awareness, of, that, desire, for, change, according, to, mark, siderits, what, the, buddhist, has, in, mind, is, that, on, one, occasion, one, part, of, the, person, might, perform, the, executive, function, on, another, occasion, another, part, might, do, so, this, would, make, it, possible, for, every, part, to, be, subject, to, control, without, there, being, any, part, that, always, fills, the, role, of, the, controller, and, so, is, the, self, on, some, occasions, a, given, part, might, fall, on, the, controller, side, while, on, other, occasions, it, might, fall, on, the, side, of, the, controlled, this, would, explain, how, it, s, possible, for, us, to, seek, to, change, any, of, the, skandhas, while, there, is, nothing, more, to, us, than, just, those, skandhas, as, noted, by, k, r, norman, and, richard, gombrich, the, buddha, extended, his, non, self, critique, to, the, brahmanical, belief, expounded, in, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, that, the, unchanging, ultimate, self, tman, was, indeed, the, whole, world, or, identical, with, brahman, this, concept, is, illustrated, in, the, alagaddupama, s, tra, where, the, buddha, argues, that, an, individual, cannot, experience, the, suffering, of, the, entire, world, he, used, the, example, of, someone, carrying, off, and, burning, grass, and, sticks, from, the, jeta, grove, and, how, a, monk, would, not, sense, or, consider, themselves, harmed, by, that, action, in, this, example, the, buddha, is, arguing, that, we, do, not, have, direct, experience, of, the, entire, world, and, hence, the, self, cannot, be, the, whole, world, in, this, buddhist, text, as, well, as, in, the, soatt, s, tra, the, buddha, outlines, six, wrong, views, about, self, there, are, six, wrong, views, an, unwise, untrained, person, may, think, of, the, body, this, is, mine, this, is, me, this, is, my, self, he, may, think, that, of, feelings, of, perceptions, of, volitions, or, of, what, has, been, seen, heard, thought, cognized, reached, sought, or, considered, by, the, mind, the, sixth, is, to, identify, the, world, and, self, to, believe, at, death, i, shall, become, permanent, eternal, unchanging, and, so, remain, forever, the, same, and, that, is, mine, that, is, me, that, is, my, self, a, wise, and, well, trained, person, sees, that, all, these, positions, are, wrong, and, so, he, is, not, worried, about, something, that, does, not, exist, furthermore, gautama, buddha, argued, that, the, world, can, be, observed, to, be, a, cause, of, suffering, brahman, was, held, to, be, ultimately, blissful, in, the, orthodox, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, and, that, since, we, cannot, control, the, world, as, we, wish, the, world, cannot, be, the, self, the, idea, that, this, cosmos, is, the, self, is, one, of, the, six, wrong, views, rejected, by, the, historical, buddha, along, with, the, related, monistic, hindu, theology, which, held, that, everything, is, a, oneness, sn, 12, 48, lokayatika, sutta, the, historical, buddha, also, held, that, understanding, and, seeing, the, truth, of, non, self, led, to, un, attachment, and, hence, to, the, cessation, of, suffering, while, ignorance, avidy, about, the, true, nature, of, personality, praj, a, led, to, further, suffering, and, attachment, all, schools, of, indian, philosophy, recognize, various, sets, of, valid, justifications, for, knowledge, pram, a, and, many, see, the, vedas, as, providing, access, to, truth, the, historical, buddha, denied, the, authority, of, the, vedas, though, like, his, contemporaries, he, affirmed, the, soteriological, importance, of, holding, the, right, view, that, is, having, a, proper, understanding, of, reality, however, this, understanding, was, not, conceived, primarily, as, metaphysical, and, cosmological, knowledge, but, as, a, piece, of, knowledge, into, the, arising, and, cessation, of, suffering, in, human, experience, therefore, the, buddha, s, epistemic, project, is, different, from, that, of, modern, philosophy, it, is, primarily, a, solution, to, the, fundamental, human, spiritual, existential, problem, gautama, buddha, s, logico, epistemology, has, been, compared, to, empiricism, in, the, sense, that, it, was, based, on, the, experience, of, the, world, through, the, senses, the, buddha, taught, that, empirical, observation, through, the, six, sense, fields, yatan, was, the, proper, way, of, verifying, any, knowledge, claims, some, buddhist, texts, go, further, stating, that, the, all, or, everything, that, exists, sabbam, are, these, six, sense, spheres, sn, 35, 23, sabba, sutta, and, that, anyone, who, attempts, to, describe, another, all, will, be, unable, to, do, so, because, it, lies, beyond, range, this, text, seems, to, indicate, that, for, the, buddha, things, in, themselves, or, noumena, are, beyond, our, epistemological, reach, avisaya, furthermore, in, the, k, l, ma, sutta, the, buddha, tells, a, group, of, confused, villagers, that, the, only, proper, reason, for, one, s, beliefs, is, verification, in, one, s, own, personal, experience, and, the, experience, of, the, wise, and, denies, any, verification, which, stems, from, a, personal, authority, sacred, tradition, anussava, or, any, kind, of, rationalism, which, constructs, metaphysical, theories, takka, in, the, tevijja, sutta, dn, 13, the, buddha, rejects, the, personal, authority, of, brahmins, because, none, of, them, can, prove, they, have, had, personal, experience, of, brahman, nor, could, any, of, them, prove, its, existence, the, buddha, also, stressed, that, experience, is, the, only, criterion, for, verification, of, the, truth, in, this, passage, from, the, majjhima, nik, ya, mn, i, 265, furthermore, the, buddha, s, standard, for, personal, verification, was, a, pragmatic, and, salvific, one, for, the, buddha, a, belief, counts, as, truth, only, if, it, leads, to, successful, buddhist, practice, and, hence, to, the, destruction, of, craving, in, the, discourse, to, prince, abhaya, mn, i, 392, 4, the, buddha, states, this, pragmatic, maxim, by, saying, that, a, belief, should, only, be, accepted, if, it, leads, to, wholesome, consequences, this, tendency, of, the, buddha, to, see, what, is, true, as, what, was, useful, or, what, works, has, been, called, by, western, scholars, such, as, mrs, rhys, davids, and, vall, e, poussin, a, form, of, pragmatism, however, k, n, jayatilleke, argues, the, buddha, s, epistemology, can, also, be, taken, to, be, a, form, of, correspondence, theory, as, per, the, apannaka, sutta, with, elements, of, coherentism, and, that, for, the, buddha, it, is, causally, impossible, for, something, which, is, false, to, lead, to, cessation, of, suffering, and, evil, gautama, buddha, discouraged, his, disciples, and, early, followers, of, buddhism, from, indulging, in, intellectual, disputation, for, its, own, sake, which, is, fruitless, and, distracts, one, from, the, ultimate, goals, of, awakening, bodhi, and, liberation, mok, a, only, philosophy, and, discussion, which, has, pragmatic, value, for, liberation, from, suffering, is, seen, as, important, according, to, the, p, li, canon, during, his, lifetime, the, buddha, remained, silent, when, asked, several, metaphysical, questions, which, he, regarded, as, the, basis, for, unwise, reflection, these, unanswered, questions, avy, k, ta, regarded, issues, such, as, whether, the, universe, is, eternal, or, non, eternal, or, whether, it, is, finite, or, infinite, the, unity, or, separation, of, the, body, and, the, self, tman, the, complete, inexistence, of, a, person, after, death, and, nirv, a, and, others, in, the, aggi, vacchagotta, sutta, the, historical, buddha, stated, that, thinking, about, these, imponderable, issues, led, to, a, thicket, of, views, a, wilderness, of, views, a, contortion, of, views, a, writhing, of, views, a, fetter, of, views, one, explanation, for, this, pragmatic, suspension, of, judgment, or, epistemic, epoch, is, that, such, questions, contribute, nothing, to, the, practical, methods, of, realizing, awakeness, during, one, s, lifetime, and, bring, about, the, danger, of, substituting, the, experience, of, liberation, by, a, conceptual, understanding, of, the, doctrine, or, by, religious, faith, according, to, the, buddha, the, dharma, is, not, an, ultimate, end, in, itself, or, an, explanation, of, all, metaphysical, reality, but, a, pragmatic, set, of, teachings, the, buddha, used, two, parables, to, clarify, this, point, the, parable, of, the, raft, and, the, parable, of, the, poisoned, arrow, the, dharma, is, like, a, raft, in, the, sense, that, it, is, only, a, pragmatic, tool, for, attaining, nirvana, for, the, purpose, of, crossing, over, not, for, the, purpose, of, holding, onto, mn, 22, once, one, has, done, this, one, can, discard, the, raft, it, is, also, like, medicine, in, that, the, particulars, of, how, one, was, injured, by, a, poisoned, arrow, i, e, metaphysics, etc, do, not, matter, in, the, act, of, removing, and, curing, the, arrow, wound, itself, removing, suffering, in, this, sense, the, buddha, was, often, called, the, great, physician, because, his, goal, was, to, cure, the, human, condition, of, suffering, first, and, foremost, not, to, speculate, about, metaphysics, having, said, this, it, is, still, clear, that, resisting, and, even, refuting, a, false, or, slanted, doctrine, can, be, useful, to, extricate, the, interlocutor, or, oneself, from, error, hence, to, advance, in, the, way, of, liberation, witness, the, buddha, s, confutation, of, several, doctrines, by, nigantha, nataputta, and, other, purported, sages, which, sometimes, had, large, followings, e, g, kula, sutta, sankha, sutta, brahmana, sutta, this, shows, that, a, virtuous, and, appropriate, use, of, dialectics, can, take, place, by, implication, reasoning, and, argument, shouldn, t, be, disparaged, by, buddhists, after, the, buddha, s, death, some, buddhists, such, as, dharmakirti, went, on, to, use, the, sayings, of, the, buddha, as, sound, evidence, equal, to, perception, and, inference, another, possible, reason, why, the, buddha, refused, to, engage, in, metaphysics, is, that, he, saw, ultimate, reality, and, nirvana, as, devoid, of, sensory, mediation, and, conception, and, therefore, language, itself, is, a, priori, inadequate, to, explain, it, thus, the, buddha, s, silence, does, not, indicate, misology, or, disdain, for, philosophy, rather, it, indicates, that, he, viewed, the, answers, to, these, questions, as, not, understandable, by, the, unenlightened, dependent, arising, provides, a, framework, for, analysis, of, reality, that, is, not, based, on, metaphysical, assumptions, regarding, existence, or, non, existence, but, instead, on, direct, cognition, of, phenomena, as, they, are, presented, to, the, mind, in, meditation, the, buddha, of, the, earliest, buddhists, texts, describes, dharma, in, the, sense, of, truth, as, beyond, reasoning, or, transcending, logic, in, the, sense, that, reasoning, is, a, subjectively, introduced, aspect, of, the, way, unenlightened, humans, perceive, things, and, the, conceptual, framework, which, underpins, their, cognitive, process, rather, than, a, feature, of, things, as, they, really, are, going, beyond, reasoning, means, in, this, context, penetrating, the, nature, of, reasoning, from, the, inside, and, removing, the, causes, for, experiencing, any, future, stress, as, a, result, of, it, rather, than, functioning, outside, the, system, as, a, whole, the, buddha, s, ethics, are, based, on, the, soteriological, need, to, eliminate, suffering, and, on, the, premise, of, the, law, of, karma, buddhist, ethics, have, been, termed, eudaimonic, with, their, goal, being, well, being, and, also, compared, to, virtue, ethics, this, approach, began, with, damien, keown, keown, writes, that, buddhist, nirvana, is, analogous, to, the, aristotelian, eudaimonia, and, that, buddhist, moral, acts, and, virtues, derive, their, value, from, how, they, lead, us, to, or, act, as, an, aspect, of, the, nirvanic, life, the, buddha, outlined, five, precepts, no, killing, stealing, sexual, misconduct, lying, or, drinking, alcohol, which, were, to, be, followed, by, his, disciples, lay, and, monastic, there, are, various, reasons, the, buddha, gave, as, to, why, someone, should, be, ethical, first, the, universe, is, structured, in, such, a, way, that, if, someone, intentionally, commits, a, misdeed, a, bad, karmic, fruit, will, be, the, result, hence, from, a, pragmatic, point, of, view, it, is, best, to, abstain, from, these, negative, actions, which, bring, forth, negative, results, however, the, important, word, here, is, intentionally, for, the, buddha, karma, is, nothing, else, but, intention, volition, and, hence, unintentionally, harming, someone, does, not, create, bad, karmic, results, unlike, the, jains, who, believed, that, karma, was, a, quasi, physical, element, for, the, buddha, karma, was, a, volitional, mental, event, what, richard, gombrich, calls, an, ethicised, consciousness, this, idea, leads, into, the, second, moral, justification, of, the, buddha, intentionally, performing, negative, actions, reinforces, and, propagates, mental, defilements, which, keep, persons, bound, to, the, cycle, of, rebirth, and, interfere, with, the, process, of, liberation, and, hence, intentionally, performing, good, karmic, actions, is, participating, in, mental, purification, which, leads, to, nirvana, the, highest, happiness, this, perspective, sees, immoral, acts, as, unskillful, akusala, in, our, quest, for, happiness, and, hence, it, is, pragmatic, to, do, good, the, third, meta, ethical, consideration, takes, the, view, of, not, self, and, our, natural, desire, to, end, our, suffering, to, its, logical, conclusion, since, there, is, no, self, there, is, no, reason, to, prefer, our, own, welfare, over, that, of, others, because, there, is, no, ultimate, grounding, for, the, differentiation, of, my, suffering, and, someone, else, s, instead, an, enlightened, person, would, just, work, to, end, suffering, tout, court, without, thinking, of, the, conventional, concept, of, persons, according, to, this, argument, anyone, who, is, selfish, does, so, out, of, ignorance, of, the, true, nature, of, personal, identity, and, irrationality, the, main, indian, buddhist, philosophical, schools, practiced, a, form, of, analysis, termed, abhidharma, which, sought, to, systematize, the, teachings, of, the, early, buddhist, discourses, sutras, abhidharma, analysis, broke, down, human, experience, into, momentary, phenomenal, events, or, occurrences, called, dharmas, dharmas, are, impermanent, and, dependent, on, other, causal, factors, they, arise, and, pass, as, part, of, a, web, of, other, interconnected, dharmas, and, are, never, found, alone, the, abhidharma, schools, held, that, the, teachings, of, the, buddha, in, the, sutras, were, merely, conventional, while, the, abhidharma, analysis, was, ultimate, truth, paramattha, sacca, the, way, things, really, are, when, seen, by, an, enlightened, being, the, abhidharmic, project, has, been, likened, as, a, form, of, phenomenology, or, process, philosophy, abhidharma, philosophers, not, only, outlined, what, they, believed, to, be, an, exhaustive, listing, of, dharmas, pali, dhammas, which, are, the, ultimate, phenomena, events, or, processes, and, include, physical, and, mental, phenomena, but, also, the, causal, relations, between, them, in, the, abhidharmic, analysis, the, only, thing, which, is, ultimately, real, is, the, interplay, of, dharmas, in, a, causal, stream, everything, else, is, merely, conceptual, pa, atti, and, nominal, this, view, has, been, termed, mereological, reductionism, by, mark, siderits, because, it, holds, that, only, impartite, entities, are, real, not, wholes, abhidharmikas, such, as, vasubandhu, argued, that, conventional, things, tables, persons, etc, disappear, under, analysis, and, that, this, analysis, reveals, only, a, causal, stream, of, phenomenal, events, and, their, relations, the, mainstream, abhidharmikas, defended, this, view, against, their, main, hindu, rivals, the, nyaya, school, who, were, substance, theorists, and, posited, the, existence, of, universals, some, abhidharmikas, such, as, the, praj, aptiv, da, were, also, strict, nominalists, and, held, that, all, things, even, dharmas, were, merely, conceptual, an, important, abhidhamma, work, from, the, therav, da, school, is, the, kath, vatthu, points, of, controversy, attributed, to, the, indian, scholar, monk, moggaliputta, tissa, c, 327, 247, bce, this, text, is, important, because, it, attempts, to, refute, several, philosophical, views, which, had, developed, after, the, death, of, the, buddha, especially, the, theory, that, all, exists, sarv, stiv, da, the, theory, of, momentariness, kh, av, da, and, the, personalist, view, pudgalavada, these, were, the, major, philosophical, theories, that, divided, the, buddhist, abhidharma, schools, in, india, after, being, brought, to, sri, lanka, in, the, first, century, bce, the, pali, language, theravada, abhidhamma, tradition, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, works, of, buddhaghosa, 4, 5th, century, ad, the, most, important, philosopher, and, commentator, of, the, theravada, school, the, theravada, philosophical, enterprise, was, mostly, carried, out, in, the, genre, of, atthakatha, commentaries, as, well, as, sub, commentaries, tikas, on, the, classic, pali, abhidhamma, texts, abhidhamma, study, also, included, smaller, doctrinal, summaries, and, compendiums, like, the, abhidhammattha, sa, gaha, the, compendium, of, things, contained, in, the, abhidhamma, the, sarv, stiv, da, vaibh, ika, sometimes, just, vaibh, ika, was, one, of, the, major, buddhist, philosophical, schools, in, india, and, they, were, so, named, because, of, their, belief, that, dharmas, exist, in, all, three, times, past, present, and, future, though, the, sarv, stiv, da, abhidharma, system, began, as, a, mere, categorization, of, mental, events, their, philosophers, and, exegetes, such, as, dharmatrata, and, katy, y, niputra, the, compiler, of, the, mah, vibh, a, great, commentary, eventually, refined, this, system, into, a, robust, realism, which, also, included, a, type, of, essentialism, or, substance, theory, this, realism, was, based, on, the, nature, of, dharmas, which, was, called, svabhava, self, nature, or, intrinsic, existence, svabhava, is, a, sort, of, essence, though, it, is, not, a, completely, independent, essence, since, all, dharmas, were, said, to, be, causally, dependent, the, sarv, stiv, da, system, extended, this, realism, across, time, effectively, positing, a, type, of, eternalism, with, regards, to, time, hence, the, name, of, their, school, means, the, view, that, everything, exists, vaibh, ika, remained, an, influential, school, in, north, india, during, the, medieval, period, perhaps, the, most, influential, figure, in, this, tradition, was, the, great, scholar, sa, ghabhadra, another, key, figure, was, ubhagupta, 720, 780, who, was, a, vaibh, ika, thinker, within, the, epistemological, pramana, tradition, other, buddhist, schools, such, as, the, praj, aptiv, da, the, nominalists, as, well, as, the, caitika, mah, s, ghikas, refused, to, accept, the, concept, of, svabhava, thus, not, all, abhidharma, sources, defend, svabhava, for, example, the, main, topic, of, the, tattvasiddhi, stra, by, harivarman, 3, 4th, century, ce, an, influential, abhidharma, text, is, the, emptiness, shunyata, of, dharmas, indeed, this, anti, essentialist, nominalism, was, widespread, among, the, mah, s, ghika, sects, another, important, feature, of, the, mah, s, ghika, tradition, was, its, unique, theory, of, consciousness, many, of, the, mah, s, ghika, sub, schools, defended, a, theory, of, self, awareness, svasa, vedana, which, held, that, consciousness, can, be, simultaneously, aware, of, itself, as, well, as, its, intentional, object, some, of, these, schools, also, held, that, the, mind, s, nature, cittasvabh, va, is, fundamentally, pure, mulavisuddha, but, it, can, be, contaminated, by, adventitious, defilements, the, therav, dins, and, other, schools, such, as, the, sautr, ntikas, those, who, follow, the, sutras, often, attacked, the, theories, of, the, sarv, stiv, dins, especially, their, theory, of, time, a, major, figure, in, this, argument, was, the, scholar, vasubandhu, a, sarv, stiv, din, monk, himself, who, was, also, influenced, by, the, critiques, of, the, sautrantika, school, who, critiqued, the, theory, of, all, exists, and, argued, for, philosophical, presentism, in, his, comprehensive, treatise, the, abhidharmako, a, this, work, is, the, major, abhidharma, text, used, in, tibetan, and, east, asian, buddhism, today, the, therav, da, also, holds, that, dharmas, only, exist, in, the, present, and, are, thus, also, presentists, the, therav, da, presentation, of, abhidharma, is, also, not, as, concerned, with, ontology, as, the, sarv, stiv, da, view, but, is, more, of, a, phenomenological, schema, hence, the, concept, of, svabhava, pali, sabhava, for, the, therav, dins, is, more, of, a, certain, characteristic, or, dependent, feature, of, a, dharma, than, any, sort, of, essence, or, metaphysical, grounding, as, the, sinhalese, scholar, y, karunadasa, writes, the, pali, tradition, only, postulates, sabhava, for, the, sake, of, definition, and, description, however, ultimately, each, dhamma, particular, phenomenon, is, not, a, singular, independent, existence, thus, karunadasa, rejects, the, view, that, theravada, abhidhamma, defends, an, ontological, pluralism, but, it, is, also, not, monism, either, since, there, is, no, single, underlying, ground, of, all, things, or, metaphysical, substratum, instead, they, are, merely, processes, that, happen, due, to, the, interplay, of, a, multitude, of, conditions, karunadasa, also, describes, the, theravada, system, as, a, critical, realism, which, sees, the, ultimate, existents, as, the, myriad, irreducible, dhammas, and, which, also, accepts, the, existence, of, an, external, world, with, entities, that, truly, exist, independently, of, cognition, as, opposed, to, mahayana, forms, of, idealism, another, important, theory, held, by, some, sarv, stiv, dins, therav, dins, and, sautr, ntikas, was, the, theory, of, momentariness, skt, k, av, da, pali, kh, av, da, this, theory, held, that, dhammas, only, last, for, a, minute, moment, ksana, after, they, arise, the, sarv, stiv, dins, saw, these, moments, in, an, atomistic, way, as, the, smallest, length, of, time, possible, they, also, developed, a, material, atomism, reconciling, this, theory, with, their, eternalism, regarding, time, was, a, major, philosophical, project, of, the, sarv, stiv, da, the, therav, dins, initially, rejected, this, theory, as, evidenced, by, the, kha, ikakath, of, the, kathavatthu, which, attempts, to, refute, the, doctrine, that, all, phenomena, dhamma, are, as, momentary, as, a, single, mental, entity, however, momentariness, with, regards, to, mental, dhammas, but, not, physical, or, r, pa, dhammas, was, later, adopted, by, the, sri, lankan, therav, dins, and, it, is, possible, that, it, was, first, introduced, by, the, scholar, buddhagosa, all, abhidharma, schools, also, developed, complex, theories, of, causation, and, conditionality, to, explain, how, dharmas, interacted, with, each, other, another, major, philosophical, project, of, the, abhidharma, schools, was, the, explanation, of, perception, some, schools, such, as, the, sarvastivadins, explained, perception, as, a, type, of, phenomenalist, realism, while, others, such, as, the, sautrantikas, preferred, representationalism, and, held, that, we, only, perceive, objects, indirectly, the, major, argument, used, for, this, view, by, the, sautr, ntikas, was, the, time, lag, argument, according, to, mark, siderits, the, basic, idea, behind, the, argument, is, that, since, there, is, always, a, tiny, gap, between, when, the, sense, comes, in, contact, with, the, external, object, and, when, there, is, sensory, awareness, what, we, are, aware, of, can, t, be, the, external, object, that, the, senses, were, in, contact, with, since, it, no, longer, exists, this, is, related, to, the, theory, of, extreme, momentariness, one, major, philosophical, view, which, was, rejected, by, all, the, schools, mentioned, above, was, the, view, held, by, the, pudgalavadin, or, personalist, schools, they, seemed, to, have, held, that, there, was, a, sort, of, personhood, in, some, ultimately, real, sense, which, was, not, reducible, to, the, five, aggregates, this, controversial, claim, was, in, contrast, to, the, other, buddhists, of, the, time, who, held, that, a, personality, was, a, mere, conceptual, construction, praj, apti, and, only, conventionally, real, from, about, the, 1st, century, bce, a, new, textual, tradition, began, to, arise, in, indian, buddhist, thought, called, mah, y, na, great, vehicle, which, would, slowly, come, to, dominate, indian, buddhist, philosophy, during, the, medieval, period, of, indian, history, buddhist, philosophy, thrived, in, large, monastery, complexes, such, as, nalanda, vikramasila, and, vallabhi, these, institutions, became, major, centers, of, philosophical, learning, in, north, india, where, both, buddhist, and, also, non, buddhist, thought, was, studied, and, debated, mah, y, na, philosophers, continued, the, philosophical, projects, of, abhidharma, while, at, the, same, time, critiquing, them, and, introducing, many, new, concepts, and, ideas, since, the, mah, y, na, held, to, the, pragmatic, concept, of, truth, which, states, that, doctrines, are, regarded, as, conditionally, true, in, the, sense, of, being, spiritually, beneficial, these, new, theories, and, practices, were, seen, as, skillful, means, upaya, the, mahayana, also, promoted, the, bodhisattva, ideal, which, included, an, attitude, of, compassion, for, all, sentient, beings, the, bodhisattva, is, someone, who, chooses, to, remain, in, samsara, the, cycle, of, birth, and, death, to, benefit, all, other, beings, who, are, suffering, major, mahayana, philosophical, schools, and, traditions, include, the, praj, aparamita, madhyamaka, yog, c, ra, tathagatagarbha, the, epistemological, school, of, dignaga, and, in, china, the, huayan, tiantai, and, zen, schools, the, earliest, praj, p, ramit, sutras, perfection, of, insight, sutras, circa, 1st, century, bce, emphasize, the, shunyata, emptiness, of, all, phenomena, it, is, thus, a, radical, global, nominalism, and, anti, essentialism, which, sees, all, things, as, illusions, and, all, of, reality, as, a, dreamlike, appearance, without, any, fundamental, essence, the, praj, p, ramit, is, said, to, be, a, transcendent, spiritual, knowledge, of, the, nature, of, ultimate, reality, which, empty, of, any, essence, or, foundation, like, a, universal, mirage, thus, the, diamond, sutra, vajracchedik, praj, p, ramit, s, tra, states, all, conditioned, phenomena, are, like, a, dream, an, illusion, a, bubble, a, shadow, like, dew, or, a, flash, of, lightning, thus, we, shall, perceive, them, the, heart, sutra, famously, affirms, the, emptiness, shunyata, of, all, phenomena, oh, sariputra, form, does, not, differ, from, emptiness, and, emptiness, does, not, differ, from, form, form, is, emptiness, and, emptiness, is, form, the, same, is, true, for, feelings, perceptions, volitions, and, consciousness, the, praj, p, ramit, sources, also, note, that, this, applies, to, every, single, phenomenon, even, buddhahood, the, goal, of, the, buddhist, aspirant, in, the, praj, p, ramit, texts, is, to, awaken, to, the, perfection, of, wisdom, praj, p, ramit, a, non, conceptual, transcendent, wisdom, that, knows, the, emptiness, of, all, things, while, not, being, attached, to, anything, including, the, very, idea, of, emptiness, itself, or, perfect, wisdom, the, praj, p, ramit, teachings, are, associated, with, the, work, of, the, buddhist, philosopher, n, g, rjuna, c, 150, c, 250, ce, and, the, madhyamaka, middle, way, or, centrism, school, n, g, rjuna, was, one, of, the, most, influential, indian, mahayana, thinkers, he, gave, the, classical, arguments, for, the, empty, nature, of, all, dharmas, and, attacked, the, essentialism, found, in, various, abhidharma, schools, and, also, in, hindu, philosophy, in, his, magnum, opus, the, root, verses, on, the, middle, way, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, in, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, nagarjuna, relies, on, reductio, ad, absurdum, arguments, to, refute, various, theories, which, assume, svabhava, an, inherent, essence, or, own, being, dravya, substances, or, any, theory, of, existence, bhava, in, this, work, he, covers, topics, such, as, causation, motion, and, the, sense, faculties, n, g, rjuna, asserted, a, direct, connection, between, even, identity, of, dependent, origination, non, self, anatta, and, emptiness, nyat, he, pointed, out, that, implicit, in, the, early, buddhist, concept, of, dependent, origination, is, the, lack, of, anatta, substantial, being, underlying, the, participants, in, origination, so, that, they, have, no, independent, existence, a, state, identified, as, nyat, i, e, emptiness, of, a, nature, or, essence, svabh, va, sunyam, later, philosophers, of, the, madhyamaka, school, built, upon, n, g, rjuna, s, analysis, and, defended, madhyamaka, against, their, opponents, these, included, ryadeva, 3rd, century, ce, n, g, rjuna, s, pupil, candrak, rti, 600, c, 650, who, wrote, an, important, commentary, on, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, and, shantideva, 8th, century, who, is, the, key, mahayana, ethicist, the, commentator, buddhap, lita, c, 470, 550, has, been, understood, as, the, originator, of, the, pr, sa, gika, approach, which, is, based, on, critiquing, essentialism, only, through, reductio, arguments, he, was, criticized, by, bh, vaviveka, c, 500, c, 578, who, argued, for, the, use, of, properly, logical, syllogisms, to, positively, argue, for, emptiness, instead, of, just, refuting, the, theories, of, others, these, two, approaches, were, later, termed, the, pr, sa, gika, and, the, sv, tantrika, approaches, to, madhyamaka, by, tibetan, philosophers, and, commentators, influenced, by, the, work, of, dignaga, bh, vaviveka, s, madhyamika, philosophy, makes, use, of, buddhist, epistemology, candrak, rti, on, the, other, hand, critiqued, bh, vaviveka, s, adoption, of, the, epistemological, pramana, tradition, on, the, grounds, that, it, contained, subtle, essentialism, he, quotes, nagarjuna, s, famous, statement, in, the, vigrahavyavartani, which, says, i, have, no, thesis, for, his, rejection, of, positive, epistemic, madhyamaka, statements, candrak, rti, held, that, a, true, madhyamika, could, only, use, consequence, prasanga, in, which, one, points, out, the, inconsistencies, of, their, opponent, s, position, without, asserting, an, autonomous, inference, svatantra, for, no, such, inference, can, be, ultimately, true, from, the, point, of, view, of, madhyamaka, in, china, the, madhyamaka, school, known, as, s, nl, n, was, founded, by, kum, raj, va, 344, 413, ce, who, translated, the, works, of, nagarjuna, to, chinese, other, chinese, madhymakas, include, kum, raj, va, s, pupil, sengzhao, jizang, 549, 623, who, wrote, over, 50, works, on, madhyamaka, and, hyegwan, a, korean, monk, who, brought, madhyamaka, teachings, to, japan, the, yog, c, ra, school, yoga, practice, was, a, buddhist, philosophical, tradition, which, arose, in, between, the, 2nd, century, ce, and, the, 4th, century, ce, and, is, associated, with, the, philosophers, and, brothers, asanga, and, vasubandhu, and, with, various, sutras, such, as, the, sandhinirmocana, sutra, and, the, lankavatara, sutra, the, central, feature, of, yog, c, ra, thought, is, the, concept, of, vij, apti, m, tra, often, translated, as, impressions, only, or, appearance, only, this, has, been, interpreted, as, a, form, of, idealism, or, as, a, form, of, phenomenology, other, names, for, the, yog, c, ra, school, are, vij, anavada, the, doctrine, of, consciousness, and, cittamatra, mind, only, yog, c, ra, thinkers, like, vasubandhu, argued, against, the, existence, of, external, objects, by, pointing, out, that, we, only, ever, have, access, to, our, own, mental, impressions, and, hence, our, inference, of, the, existence, of, external, objects, is, based, on, faulty, logic, vasubandhu, s, tri, ik, vij, aptim, trat, the, proof, that, there, are, only, impressions, in, thirty, verses, begins, thus, i, this, is, nothing, but, impressions, since, it, manifests, itself, as, an, unreal, object, just, like, the, case, of, those, with, cataracts, seeing, unreal, hairs, in, the, moon, and, the, like, according, to, vasubandhu, then, all, our, experiences, are, like, seeing, hairs, on, the, moon, when, we, have, cataracts, that, is, we, project, our, mental, images, into, something, out, there, when, there, are, no, such, things, vasubandhu, then, goes, on, to, use, the, dream, argument, to, argue, that, mental, impressions, do, not, require, external, objects, to, 1, seem, to, be, spatio, temporally, located, 2, to, seem, to, have, an, inter, subjective, quality, and, 3, to, seem, to, operate, by, causal, laws, the, fact, that, purely, mental, events, can, have, causal, efficacy, and, be, intersubjective, is, proved, by, the, event, of, a, wet, dream, and, by, the, mass, or, shared, hallucinations, created, by, the, karma, of, certain, types, of, beings, after, having, argued, that, impressions, only, is, a, theory, that, can, explain, our, everyday, experience, vasubandhu, then, appeals, to, parsimony, since, we, do, not, need, the, concept, of, external, objects, to, explain, reality, then, we, can, do, away, with, those, superfluous, concepts, altogether, as, they, are, most, likely, just, mentally, superimposed, on, our, concepts, of, reality, by, the, mind, yog, c, rins, like, vasubandhu, also, attacked, the, realist, theories, of, buddhist, atomism, and, the, abhidharma, theory, of, svabhava, he, argued, that, atoms, as, conceived, by, the, atomists, un, divisible, entities, would, not, be, able, to, come, together, to, form, larger, aggregate, entities, and, hence, that, they, were, illogical, concepts, inter, subjective, reality, for, vasubandhu, is, then, the, causal, interaction, between, various, mental, streams, and, their, karma, and, does, not, include, any, external, physical, objects, the, soteriological, importance, of, this, theory, is, that, by, removing, the, concept, of, an, external, world, it, also, weakens, the, internal, sense, of, self, as, an, observer, which, is, supposed, to, be, separate, from, the, external, world, to, dissolve, the, dualism, of, inner, and, outer, is, also, to, dissolve, the, sense, of, self, and, other, the, later, yogacara, commentator, sthiramati, explains, this, thus, there, is, a, grasper, if, there, is, something, to, be, grasped, but, not, in, the, absence, of, what, is, to, be, grasped, where, there, is, nothing, to, be, grasped, the, absence, of, a, grasper, also, follows, there, is, not, just, the, absence, of, the, thing, to, be, grasped, thus, there, arises, the, extra, mundane, non, conceptual, cognition, that, is, alike, without, object, and, without, cognizer, apart, from, its, defense, of, an, idealistic, metaphysics, and, its, attacks, on, realism, yog, c, ra, sources, also, developed, a, new, theory, of, mind, based, on, the, eight, consciousnesses, which, includes, the, innovative, doctrine, of, the, subliminal, storehouse, consciousness, skt, layavij, na, yog, c, ra, thinkers, also, developed, a, positive, account, of, ultimate, reality, based, on, three, basic, modes, or, natures, svabh, va, this, metaphysical, doctrine, is, central, to, their, view, of, the, ultimate, and, to, their, understanding, of, the, doctrine, of, emptiness, nyat, dign, ga, c, 480, 540, and, dharmak, rti, c, 6, 7th, century, were, buddhist, philosophers, who, developed, a, system, of, epistemology, pramana, and, logic, in, their, debates, with, the, brahminical, philosophers, in, order, to, defend, buddhist, doctrine, this, tradition, is, called, those, who, follow, reasoning, tibetan, rigs, pa, rjes, su, brang, ba, in, modern, literature, it, is, sometimes, known, by, the, sanskrit, pram, av, da, or, the, epistemological, school, they, were, associated, with, the, yogacara, and, sautrantika, schools, and, defended, theories, held, by, both, of, these, schools, dign, ga, s, influence, was, profound, and, led, to, an, epistemological, turn, among, all, buddhists, and, also, all, sanskrit, language, philosophers, in, india, after, his, death, in, the, centuries, following, dign, ga, s, work, sanskrit, philosophers, became, much, more, focused, on, defending, all, of, their, propositions, with, fully, developed, theories, of, knowledge, the, school, of, dign, ga, includes, later, philosophers, and, commentators, like, santabhadra, dharmottara, 8th, century, praj, akaragupta, 740, 800, c, e, j, anasrimitra, 975, 1025, ratnak, rti, 11th, century, and, a, karanandana, fl, c, 9th, or, 10th, century, the, epistemology, they, developed, defends, the, view, that, there, are, only, two, instruments, of, knowledge, or, valid, cognitions, pramana, perception, pratyaksa, and, inference, anum, a, perception, is, a, non, conceptual, awareness, of, particulars, which, is, bound, by, causality, while, inference, is, reasonable, linguistic, and, conceptual, these, buddhist, philosophers, argued, in, favor, of, the, theory, of, momentariness, the, yog, c, ra, awareness, only, view, the, reality, of, particulars, svalak, a, a, atomism, nominalism, and, the, self, reflexive, nature, of, consciousness, svasa, vedana, they, attacked, hindu, theories, of, god, isvara, universals, the, authority, of, the, vedas, and, the, existence, of, a, permanent, soul, atman, after, the, time, of, asanga, and, vasubandhu, the, yog, c, ra, school, developed, in, different, directions, one, branch, focused, on, epistemology, this, would, become, the, school, of, dignaga, another, branch, focused, on, expanding, the, yog, c, ra, s, metaphysics, and, philosophy, this, latter, tradition, includes, figures, like, dharmapala, of, nalanda, sthiramati, chandragomin, who, was, known, to, have, debated, the, madhyamaka, thinker, candrakirti, and, labhadra, a, top, scholar, at, nalanda, yog, c, rins, such, as, paramartha, and, gu, abhadra, brought, the, school, to, china, and, translated, yogacara, works, there, where, it, is, known, as, w, ish, z, ng, or, f, xi, ng, z, ng, an, important, contribution, to, east, asian, yog, c, ra, is, xuanzang, s, cheng, weishi, lun, or, discourse, on, the, establishment, of, consciousness, only, a, later, development, is, the, rise, of, a, syncretic, tradition, of, yog, c, ra, tath, gatagarbha, thought, this, group, adopted, the, doctrine, of, tath, gatagarbha, the, buddha, womb, buddha, source, or, buddha, within, found, in, various, tath, gatagarbha, sutras, this, hybrid, school, eventually, went, on, to, equate, the, tath, gatagarbha, with, the, pure, aspect, of, the, storehouse, consciousness, some, key, sources, of, this, school, are, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, ratnagotravibh, ga, uttaratantra, and, in, china, the, influential, mahayana, awakening, of, faith, treatise, one, key, figure, of, this, tradition, was, param, rtha, an, indian, monk, who, was, an, important, translator, in, china, he, promoted, a, new, theory, that, said, there, was, a, stainless, consciousness, amala, vij, na, a, pure, wisdom, within, all, beings, which, he, equated, with, the, buddha, nature, tath, gatagarbha, this, synthetic, tradition, also, became, important, in, later, indian, buddhism, where, the, ratnagotravibh, ga, became, the, key, text, another, later, development, was, the, synthesis, of, yog, c, ra, with, madhyamaka, j, nagarbha, 8th, century, and, his, student, ntarak, ita, 725, 788, brought, together, yogacara, madhyamaka, and, the, dignaga, school, of, epistemology, into, a, philosophical, synthesis, known, as, the, yog, c, ra, svatantrika, m, dhyamika, ntarak, ita, was, also, instrumental, in, the, introduction, of, buddhism, and, the, sarvastivadin, monastic, ordination, lineage, to, tibet, which, was, conducted, at, samye, ntarak, ita, s, disciples, included, haribhadra, and, kamala, la, this, philosophical, tradition, is, influential, in, tibetan, buddhist, thought, perhaps, the, most, important, debate, among, late, yog, c, ra, philosophers, was, the, debate, between, alik, k, rav, da, tib, rnam, rdzun, pa, false, aspectarians, also, known, as, nir, k, rav, da, and, saty, k, rav, da, rnam, bden, pa, true, aspectarians, also, known, as, s, k, rav, da, the, crux, of, the, debate, was, the, question, of, whether, mental, appearances, images, or, aspects, k, ra, are, true, satya, or, false, alika, the, saty, k, rav, da, camp, defended, by, scholars, like, praj, akaragupta, ca, 8th, 9th, century, and, j, na, r, mitra, ca, 980, 1040, held, that, images, in, consciousness, have, a, real, existence, since, they, arise, from, a, real, consciousness, meanwhile, alik, k, rav, da, defenders, like, sthiramati, and, ratn, kara, nti, ca, 970, 1045, argued, that, mental, appearances, do, not, really, exist, and, are, false, al, ka, or, illusory, for, these, thinkers, the, only, thing, which, is, real, is, a, pure, self, aware, consciousness, which, is, contentless, nir, k, ra, without, images, the, tath, gathagarbha, sutras, in, a, departure, from, mainstream, buddhist, language, insist, that, there, is, a, real, potential, for, awakening, is, inherent, to, every, sentient, being, they, marked, a, shift, from, a, largely, apophatic, negative, method, within, buddhism, to, a, decidedly, more, cataphatic, positive, mode, the, main, topic, of, this, genre, of, literature, is, the, tath, gata, garbha, which, can, mean, the, womb, or, embryo, of, a, tath, gata, i, e, a, buddha, and, is, what, allows, someone, to, become, a, buddha, another, similar, term, used, for, this, idea, is, buddhadh, tu, buddha, nature, or, source, of, the, buddhas, prior, to, the, period, of, these, scriptures, mah, y, na, metaphysics, had, been, dominated, by, teachings, on, emptiness, the, language, used, by, this, approach, is, primarily, negative, and, the, buddha, nature, literature, can, be, seen, as, an, attempt, to, state, orthodox, buddhist, teachings, of, dependent, origination, using, positive, language, instead, to, prevent, people, from, being, turned, away, from, buddhism, by, a, false, impression, of, nihilism, in, these, sutras, the, perfection, of, the, wisdom, of, not, self, is, stated, to, be, the, true, self, atman, the, word, self, atman, is, used, in, a, way, idiosyncratic, to, these, sutras, the, true, self, is, described, as, the, perfection, of, the, wisdom, of, not, self, in, the, buddha, nature, treatise, f, x, ng, l, n, t, 1610, of, param, rtha, for, example, the, ultimate, goal, of, the, path, is, then, characterized, using, a, range, of, positive, language, that, had, been, used, previously, in, indian, philosophy, by, essentialist, philosophers, but, which, was, now, adapted, to, describe, the, positive, realities, of, buddhahood, perhaps, the, most, influential, source, in, the, indian, tradition, for, this, teaching, is, the, ratnagotravibh, ga, 5th, century, ce, this, stra, brought, together, all, the, major, themes, of, the, tath, gatag, rbha, theory, into, a, single, treatise, the, ratnagotravibh, ga, sees, the, tath, gatagarbha, as, being, an, inherent, nature, in, all, things, which, is, omnipresent, all, pervasive, non, conceptual, free, of, suffering, and, inherently, blissful, it, also, describes, buddha, nature, as, the, intrinsically, stainless, nature, of, the, mind, cittaprak, tivaimalya, indeed, in, many, later, indian, sources, the, tath, gathagarbha, teachings, also, come, to, be, identified, with, the, similar, doctrine, of, the, luminous, mind, prabhasvara, citta, this, ancient, idea, holds, that, the, mind, is, inherently, pure, and, that, defilements, are, only, adventitious, in, the, ratnagotravibh, ga, this, originally, pure, prak, tipari, uddha, nature, i, e, the, fully, purified, buddha, nature, is, further, described, through, numerous, terms, such, as, unconditioned, asa, sk, ta, unborn, aj, ta, unarisen, anutpanna, eternal, nitya, changeless, dhruva, and, permanent, vata, according, to, some, scholars, tath, gatagarbha, does, not, represent, a, substantial, self, rather, it, is, a, positive, language, expression, of, emptiness, and, represents, the, potentiality, to, realize, buddhahood, through, buddhist, practices, in, this, interpretation, the, intention, of, the, teaching, of, tath, gatagarbha, is, soteriological, rather, than, metaphysical, vajray, na, also, mantray, na, sacret, mantra, tantray, na, and, esoteric, buddhism, is, a, mahayana, buddhist, tradition, associated, with, a, group, of, texts, known, as, the, buddhist, tantras, which, had, developed, into, a, major, force, in, india, by, the, eighth, century, by, this, time, indian, tantric, scholars, were, developing, philosophical, defenses, hermeneutics, and, explanations, of, the, buddhist, tantric, systems, especially, through, commentaries, on, key, tantras, such, as, the, guhyasam, ja, tantra, mahavairocana, sutra, and, the, guhyagarbha, tantra, while, the, view, of, the, vajray, na, was, based, on, the, earlier, madhyamaka, yogacara, and, buddha, nature, theories, it, saw, itself, as, being, a, faster, vehicle, to, liberation, containing, many, skillful, methods, upaya, of, tantric, ritual, the, need, for, an, explication, and, defense, of, the, tantras, arose, out, of, the, unusual, nature, of, the, rituals, associated, with, them, which, included, the, use, of, secret, mantras, alcohol, sexual, yoga, complex, visualizations, of, mandalas, filled, with, wrathful, deities, and, other, practices, which, were, discordant, with, or, at, least, novel, in, comparison, to, traditional, buddhist, practice, the, guhyasam, ja, tantra, for, example, states, you, should, kill, living, beings, speak, lying, words, take, things, that, are, not, given, and, have, sex, with, many, women, other, features, of, tantra, included, a, focus, on, the, physical, body, as, the, means, to, liberation, and, a, reaffirmation, of, feminine, elements, feminine, deities, and, a, positive, view, of, sexuality, the, defense, of, these, tantric, practices, is, based, on, the, theory, of, transformation, which, states, that, negative, mental, factors, and, physical, actions, can, be, cultivated, and, transformed, in, a, ritual, setting, the, hevajra, tantra, states, those, things, by, which, evil, men, are, bound, others, turn, into, means, and, gain, thereby, release, from, the, bonds, of, existence, by, passion, the, world, is, bound, by, passion, too, it, is, released, but, by, heretical, buddhists, this, practice, of, reversals, is, not, known, another, hermeneutic, of, buddhist, tantric, commentaries, such, as, the, vimalaprabha, stainless, light, of, pundarika, a, commentary, on, the, kalacakra, tantra, is, one, of, interpreting, taboo, or, unethical, statements, in, the, tantras, as, metaphorical, statements, about, tantric, practice, and, physiology, for, example, in, the, vimalaprabha, killing, living, beings, refers, to, stopping, the, prana, at, the, top, of, the, head, in, the, tantric, candrakirti, s, pradipoddyotana, a, commentary, to, the, guhyasamaja, tantra, killing, living, beings, is, glossed, as, making, them, void, by, means, of, a, special, samadhi, which, according, to, bus, ton, is, associated, with, completion, stage, tantric, practice, douglas, duckworth, notes, that, vajray, na, philosophical, outlook, is, one, of, embodiment, which, sees, the, physical, and, cosmological, body, as, already, containing, wisdom, and, divinity, liberation, nirvana, and, buddhahood, are, not, seen, as, something, outside, the, body, or, an, event, in, the, future, but, as, imminently, present, and, accessible, right, now, through, unique, tantric, practices, like, deity, yoga, hence, vajray, na, is, also, called, the, resultant, vehicle, that, is, to, say, it, is, the, spiritual, vehicle, that, relies, on, the, immanent, nature, of, the, result, of, practice, liberation, which, is, already, present, in, all, beings, duckworth, names, the, philosophical, view, of, vajray, na, as, a, form, of, pantheism, by, which, he, means, the, belief, that, every, existing, entity, is, in, some, sense, divine, and, that, all, things, express, some, form, of, unity, major, indian, tantric, buddhist, philosophers, such, as, buddhaguhya, padmavajra, author, of, the, guhyasiddhi, commentary, nagarjuna, the, 7th, century, disciple, of, saraha, indrabhuti, author, of, the, j, nasiddhi, anangavajra, dombiheruka, durjayacandra, ratn, kara, nti, and, abhayakaragupta, wrote, tantric, texts, and, commentaries, systematizing, the, tradition, others, such, as, vajrabodhi, and, ubhakarasi, ha, brought, tantra, to, tang, china, 716, to, 720, and, tantric, philosophy, continued, to, be, developed, in, chinese, and, japanese, by, thinkers, such, as, yi, xing, 683, 727, and, k, kai, 774, 835, in, tibet, philosophers, such, as, sakya, pandita, 1182, 28, 1251, longchenpa, 1308, 1364, and, tsongkhapa, 1357, 1419, continued, the, tradition, of, buddhist, tantric, philosophy, in, classical, tibetan, tibetan, buddhist, philosophy, is, mainly, a, continuation, and, refinement, of, the, indian, mahayana, philosophical, traditions, the, initial, efforts, of, ntarak, ita, and, kamala, la, brought, their, eclectic, scholarly, tradition, to, tibet, the, initial, work, of, early, tibetan, buddhist, philosophers, was, in, the, translation, of, classical, indian, philosophical, treatises, and, the, writing, of, commentaries, this, initial, period, is, from, the, 8th, to, the, 10th, century, early, tibetan, commentator, philosophers, were, heavily, influenced, by, the, work, of, dharmakirti, and, these, include, ngok, loden, sherab, 1059, 1109, and, chaba, ch, kyi, senge, 1182, 1251, their, works, are, now, lost, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, saw, the, translation, of, the, works, of, chandrakirti, the, promulgation, of, his, views, in, tibet, by, scholars, such, as, patsab, nyima, drakpa, kanakavarman, and, jayananda, 12th, century, and, the, development, of, the, tibetan, debate, between, the, prasangika, and, svatantrika, views, which, continues, to, this, day, among, tibetan, buddhist, schools, the, main, disagreement, between, these, views, is, the, use, of, reasoned, argument, for, ntarak, ita, s, school, reason, is, useful, in, establishing, arguments, that, lead, one, to, a, correct, understanding, of, emptiness, then, through, the, use, of, meditation, one, can, reach, non, conceptual, gnosis, that, does, not, rely, on, reason, however, chandrakirti, rejects, this, idea, because, meditation, on, emptiness, cannot, possibly, involve, any, object, reason, s, role, for, him, is, purely, negative, reason, is, used, to, negate, any, essentialist, view, and, then, eventually, reason, must, also, negate, itself, along, with, any, conceptual, proliferation, prapa, ca, another, very, influential, figure, from, this, early, period, is, mabja, jangchub, ts, ndr, d, 1185, who, wrote, an, important, commentary, on, nagarjuna, s, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, mabja, was, studied, under, the, dharmakirtian, chaba, and, also, the, candrakirti, scholar, patsab, his, work, shows, an, attempt, to, steer, a, middle, course, between, their, views, he, affirms, the, conventional, usefulness, of, pram, a, epistemology, but, also, accepts, candrakirti, s, prasangika, views, mabja, s, madhyamaka, scholarship, was, very, influential, on, later, tibetan, madhyamikas, such, as, longchenpa, tsongkhapa, gorampa, and, miky, dorje, there, are, various, tibetan, buddhist, schools, or, monastic, orders, according, to, georges, b, j, dreyfus, within, tibetan, thought, the, sakya, school, holds, a, mostly, anti, realist, philosophical, position, which, sees, sa, v, tisatya, conventional, truth, as, an, illusion, while, the, gelug, school, tends, to, defend, a, form, of, realism, which, accepts, that, conventional, truth, is, in, some, sense, real, and, true, yet, dependently, originated, the, kagyu, and, nyingma, schools, also, tend, to, follow, sakya, anti, realism, with, some, differences, the, 14th, century, saw, increasing, interest, in, the, buddha, nature, texts, and, doctrines, this, can, be, seen, in, the, work, of, the, third, kagyu, karmapa, rangjung, dorje, 1284, 1339, especially, his, treatise, profound, inner, meaning, this, treatise, describes, ultimate, nature, or, suchness, as, buddha, nature, which, is, the, basis, for, nirvana, and, samsara, radiant, in, nature, and, empty, in, essence, surpassing, thought, one, of, the, most, important, theoriests, of, buddha, nature, in, tibet, was, the, scholar, yogi, d, lpopa, sh, rap, gyeltsen, c, 1292, 1361, a, figure, of, the, jonang, school, d, lpopa, developed, a, view, called, shentong, wylie, gzhan, stong, other, emptiness, based, on, earlier, yogacara, and, buddha, nature, ideas, present, in, indian, sources, including, the, buddha, nature, literature, the, k, lacakratantra, and, the, works, of, ratn, kara, nti, the, shentong, view, holds, that, buddhahood, is, already, immanent, in, all, living, beings, as, an, eternal, and, all, pervaside, non, dual, wisdom, he, termed, all, basis, wisdom, or, gnosis, of, the, ground, of, all, tib, kun, gzhi, ye, shes, skt, laya, j, na, this, view, holds, that, all, relative, phenomena, are, empty, of, inherent, existence, but, that, the, ultimate, reality, the, buddha, wisdom, buddha, j, ana, is, not, empty, of, its, own, inherent, existence, according, to, d, lpopa, all, beings, are, said, to, have, the, buddha, nature, the, non, dual, wisdom, which, is, real, unchanging, permanent, non, conditioned, eternal, blissful, and, compassionate, this, ultimate, buddha, wisdom, is, uncreated, and, indestructible, unconditioned, and, beyond, the, chain, of, dependent, origination, and, is, the, basis, for, both, samsara, and, nirvana, dolpopa, s, shentong, view, also, taught, that, ultimate, reality, was, truly, a, great, self, or, supreme, self, referring, to, works, such, as, the, mah, y, na, mah, parinirv, a, s, tra, the, a, gulim, l, ya, s, tra, and, the, r, m, l, dev, si, han, da, s, tra, the, shentong, view, had, an, influence, on, philosophers, of, other, schools, such, as, nyingma, and, kagyu, thinkers, and, was, also, widely, criticized, in, some, circles, as, being, similar, to, the, hindu, notions, of, atman, the, shentong, philosophy, was, also, expounded, in, tibet, and, mongolia, by, the, later, jonang, scholar, t, ran, tha, 1575, 1634, and, numerous, later, figures, of, the, jonang, tradition, in, the, late, 17th, century, the, jonang, order, and, its, teachings, came, under, attack, by, the, 5th, dalai, lama, who, converted, the, majority, of, their, monasteries, in, tibet, to, the, gelug, order, although, several, survived, in, secret, je, tsongkhapa, dzong, ka, ba, 1357, 1419, founded, the, gelug, school, of, tibetan, buddhism, which, came, to, dominate, the, country, through, the, office, of, the, dalai, lama, and, is, the, major, defender, of, the, prasa, gika, madhyamaka, view, his, work, is, influenced, by, the, philosophy, of, candrakirti, and, dharmakirti, tsongkhapa, s, magnum, opus, is, the, ocean, of, reasoning, a, commentary, on, nagarjuna, s, mulamadhyamakakarika, gelug, philosophy, is, based, upon, the, study, of, madhyamaka, texts, and, tsongkhapa, s, works, as, well, as, formal, debate, rtsod, pa, tsongkhapa, defended, prasangika, madhyamaka, as, the, highest, view, and, critiqued, the, svatantrika, position, tsongkhapa, argued, that, because, svatantrika, conventionally, establishes, things, by, their, own, characteristics, they, fail, to, completely, understand, the, emptiness, of, phenomena, and, hence, do, not, achieve, the, same, realization, drawing, on, chandrakirti, tsongkhapa, rejected, the, yogacara, teachings, even, as, a, provisional, stepping, point, to, the, madhyamaka, view, tsongkhapa, was, also, critical, of, the, shengtong, view, of, dolpopa, which, he, saw, as, dangerously, absolutist, and, hence, outside, the, middle, way, tsongkhapa, identified, two, major, flaws, in, interpretations, of, madhyamika, under, negation, of, svabhava, or, own, essence, which, could, lead, to, absolutism, and, over, negation, which, could, lead, to, nihilism, tsongkhapa, s, solution, to, this, dilemma, was, the, promotion, of, the, use, of, inferential, reasoning, only, within, the, conventional, realm, of, the, two, truths, framework, allowing, for, the, use, of, reason, for, ethics, conventional, monastic, rules, and, promoting, a, conventional, epistemic, realism, while, holding, that, from, the, view, of, ultimate, truth, paramarthika, satya, all, things, including, buddha, nature, and, nirvana, are, empty, of, inherent, existence, svabhava, and, that, true, liberation, is, this, realization, of, emptiness, sakya, scholars, such, as, rongt, n, and, gorampa,

to, reconcile, the, views, of, the, yogacara, and, madhyamaka, seeing, them, both, as, valid, and, complementary, perspectives, on, ultimate, truth, madhyamaka, is, seen, by, chokden, as, removing, the, fault, of, taking, the, unreal, as, being, real, and, yogacara, removes, the, fault, of, the, denial, of, reality, likewise, the, shentong, and, rangtong, views, are, seen, as, complementary, by, sakya, chokden, rangtong, negation, is, effective, in, cutting, through, all, clinging, to, wrong, views, and, conceptual, rectification, while, shentong, is, more, amenable, for, describing, and, enhancing, meditative, experience, and, realization, therefore, for, sakya, chokden, the, same, realization, of, ultimate, reality, can, be, accessed, and, described, in, two, different, but, compatible, ways, the, nyingma, school, is, strongly, influenced, by, the, view, of, dzogchen, great, perfection, and, the, dzogchen, tantric, literature, longchenpa, 1308, 1364, was, a, major, philosopher, of, the, nyingma, school, and, wrote, an, extensive, number, of, works, on, the, tibetan, practice, of, dzogchen, and, on, buddhist, tantra, these, include, the, seven, treasures, the, trilogy, of, natural, ease, and, his, trilogy, of, dispelling, darkness, longchenpa, s, works, provide, a, philosophical, understanding, of, dzogchen, a, defense, of, dzogchen, in, light, of, the,

between, sutra, and, tantra, longchenpa, s, philosophy, sought, to, establish, the, positive, aspects, of, buddha, nature, thought, against, the, totally, negative, theology, of, madhyamika, without, straying, into, the, absolutism, of, dolpopa, for, longchenpa, the, basis, for, dzogchen, and, tantric, practice, in, vajrayana, is, the, ground, or, basis, gzhi, the, immanent, buddha, nature, the,

non, sectarian, unbiased, which, sought, to, push, back, against, the, politically, dominant, gelug, school, s, criticisms, of, the, sakya, kagyu, nyingma, and, bon, philosophical, views, and, develop, a, more, eclectic, or, universal, system, of, textual, study, jamyang, khyentse, wangpo, 1820, 1892, and, jamg, n, kongtr, l, 1813, 1899, were, the, founders, of, rim, the, rim, movement, came, to, prominence, at, a, point, in, tibetan, history, when, the, religious, climate, had, become, partisan, the, aim, of, the, movement, was, a, push, towards, a, middle, ground, where, the, various, views, and, styles, of, the, different, traditions, were, appreciated, for, their, individual, contributions, rather, than, being, refuted, marginalized, or, banned, philosophically, jamg, n, kongtr, l, defended, shentong, as, being, compatible, with, madhyamaka, while, another, rim, scholar, jamgon, ju, mipham, gyatso, 1846, 1912, criticized, tsongkhapa, from, a, nyingma, perspective, mipham, argued, that, the, view, of, the, middle, way, is, unity, zung, jug, meaning, that, from, the, ultimate, perspective, the, duality, of, sentient, beings, and, buddhas, is, also, dissolved, mipham, also, affirmed, the, view, of, rangtong, self, emptiness, the, later, nyingma, scholar, botrul, 1894, 1959, classified, the, major, tibetan, madhyamaka, positions, as, shentong, other, emptiness, nyingma, rangtong, self, emptiness, and, gelug, bdentong, emptiness, of, true, existence, the, main, difference, between, them, is, their, object, of, negation, shengtong, states, that, inauthentic, experience, is, empty, rangtong, negates, any, conceptual, reference, and, bdentong, negates, any, true, existence, the, 14th, dalai, lama, was, also, influenced, by, this, non, sectarian, approach, having, studied, under, teachers, from, all, major, tibetan, buddhist, schools, his, philosophical, position, tends, to, be, that, the, different, perspectives, on, emptiness, are, complementary, there, is, a, tradition, of, making, a, distinction, between, two, different, perspectives, on, the, nature, of, emptiness, one, is, when, emptiness, is, presented, within, a, philosophical, analysis, of, the, ultimate, reality, of, things, in, which, case, it, ought, to, be, understood, in, terms, of, a, non, affirming, negative, phenomena, on, the, other, hand, when, it, is, discussed, from, the, point, of, view, of, experience, it, should, be, understood, more, in, terms, of, an, affirming, negation, 14th, dalai, lama, the, schools, of, buddhism, that, had, existed, in, china, prior, to, the, emergence, of, the, tiantai, are, generally, believed, to, represent, direct, transplantations, from, india, with, little, modification, to, their, basic, doctrines, and, methods, the, tiantai, school, founded, by, zhiyi, 538, 597, was, the, first, truly, unique, chinese, buddhist, philosophical, school, tiantai, doctrine, sought, to, bring, together, all, buddhist, teachings, into, a, comprehensive, system, based, on, the, ekayana, one, vehicle, doctrine, taught, in, the, lotus, sutra, tiantai, s, metaphysics, is, an, immanent, holism, which, sees, every, phenomenon, dharma, as, conditioned, and, manifested, by, the, whole, of, reality, the, totality, of, all, other, dharmas, every, instant, of, experience, is, a, reflection, of, every, other, and, hence, suffering, and, nirvana, good, and, bad, buddhahood, and, evildoing, are, all, inherently, entailed, within, each, other, tiantai, metaphysics, is, entailed, in, their, teaching, of, the, three, truths, which, is, an, extension, of, the, m, dhyamaka, two, truths, doctrine, the, three, truths, are, the, conventional, truth, of, appearance, the, truth, of, emptiness, and, the, third, truth, of, the, exclusive, center, danzhong, or, middle, way, which, is, beyond, conventional, truth, and, emptiness, this, third, truth, is, the, absolute, and, expressed, by, the, claim, that, nothing, is, neither, same, nor, different, than, anything, else, but, rather, each, thing, is, the, absolute, totality, of, all, things, manifesting, as, a, particular, everything, is, mutually, contained, within, each, thing, everything, is, a, reflection, of, the, ultimate, reality, of, all, appearances, zhufashixiang, and, each, thought, contains, three, thousand, worlds, this, perspective, allows, the, tiantai, school, to, state, such, seemingly, paradoxical, things, as, evil, is, ineradicable, from, the, highest, good, buddhahood, moreover, in, tiantai, nirvana, and, samsara, are, ultimately, the, same, as, zhiyi, writes, a, single, unalloyed, reality, is, all, there, is, no, entities, whatever, exist, outside, of, it, while, zhiyi, did, write, one, thought, contains, three, thousand, worlds, this, does, not, entail, idealism, according, to, zhiyi, the, objects, of, the, aspects, of, reality, are, not, something, produced, by, buddhas, gods, or, men, they, exist, inherently, on, their, own, and, have, no, beginning, the, esoteric, meaning, 210, this, is, then, a, form, of, realism, which, sees, the, mind, as, real, as, the, world, interconnected, with, and, inseparable, from, it, in, tiantai, thought, ultimate, reality, is, simply, the, very, phenomenal, world, of, interconnected, events, or, dharmas, other, key, figures, of, tiantai, thought, are, zhanran, 711, 782, and, siming, zhili, 960, 1028, zhanran, developed, the, idea, that, non, sentient, beings, have, buddha, nature, since, they, are, also, a, reflection, of, the, absolute, in, japan, this, school, was, known, as, tendai, and, was, first, brought, to, the, island, by, saicho, tendai, thought, is, more, syncretic, and, draws, on, huayan, and, east, asian, esoteric, buddhism, the, huayan, school, is, the, other, native, chinese, doctrinal, system, huayan, is, known, for, the, doctrine, of, interpenetration, sanskrit, yuganaddha, based, on, the, avata, saka, s, tra, flower, garland, sutra, huayan, holds, that, all, phenomena, sanskrit, dharmas, are, deeply, interconnected, mutually, arising, and, that, every, phenomenon, contains, all, other, phenomena, various, metaphors, and, images, are, used, to, illustrate, this, idea, the, first, is, known, as, indra, s, net, the, net, is, set, with, jewels, which, have, the, extraordinary, property, that, they, reflect, all, of, the, other, jewels, while, the, reflections, also, contain, every, other, reflection, ad, infinitum, the, second, image, is, that, of, the, world, text, this, image, portrays, the, world, as, consisting, of, an, enormous, text, which, is, as, large, as, the, universe, itself, the, words, of, the, text, are, composed, of, the, phenomena, that, make, up, the, world, however, every, atom, of, the, world, contains, the, whole, text, within, it, it, is, the, work, of, a, buddha, to, let, out, the, text, so, that, beings, can, be, liberated, from, suffering, fazang, fa, tsang, 643, 712, one, of, the, most, important, huayan, thinkers, wrote, essay, on, the, golden, lion, and, treatise, on, the, five, teachings, which, contain, other, metaphors, for, the, interpenetration, of, reality, he, also, used, the, metaphor, of, a, house, of, mirrors, fazang, introduced, the, distinction, of, the, realm, of, principle, and, the, realm, of, things, this, theory, was, further, developed, by, cheng, guan, 738, 839, into, the, major, huayan, thesis, of, the, fourfold, dharmadhatu, dharma, realm, the, realm, of, principle, the, realm, of, things, the, realm, of, the, noninterference, between, principle, and, things, and, the, realm, of, the, noninterference, of, all, things, the, first, two, are, the, universal, and, the, particular, the, third, is, the, interpenetration, of, universal, and, particular, and, the, fourth, is, the, interpenetration, of, all, particulars, the, third, truth, was, explained, by, the, metaphor, of, a, golden, lion, the, gold, is, the, universal, and, the, particular, is, the, shape, and, features, of, the, lion, while, both, tiantai, and, huayan, hold, to, the, interpenetration, and, interconnection, of, all, things, their, metaphysics, have, some, differences, huayan, metaphysics, is, influenced, by, yogacara, thought, and, is, closer, to, idealism, the, avatamsaka, sutra, compares, the, phenomenal, world, to, a, dream, an, illusion, and, a, magician, s, conjuring, the, sutra, states, nothing, has, true, reality, location, beginning, and, end, or, substantial, nature, the, avatamsaka, also, states, that, the, triple, world, is, illusory, it, is, only, made, by, one, mind, and, fazang, echoes, this, by, writing, outside, of, mind, there, is, not, a, single, thing, that, can, be, apprehended, furthermore, according, to, huayan, thought, each, mind, creates, its, own, world, according, to, their, mental, patterns, and, these, worlds, are, infinite, in, kind, and, constantly, arising, and, passing, away, however, in, huayan, the, mind, is, not, real, either, but, also, empty, the, true, reality, in, huayan, the, noumenon, or, principle, is, likened, to, a, mirror, while, phenomena, are, compared, to, reflections, in, the, mirror, it, is, also, compared, to, the, ocean, and, phenomena, to, waves, in, korea, this, school, was, known, as, hwaeom, and, is, represented, in, the, work, of, wonhyo, 617, 686, who, also, wrote, about, the, idea, of, essence, function, a, central, theme, in, korean, buddhist, thought, in, japan, huayan, is, known, as, kegon, and, one, of, its, major, proponents, was,

provided, the, theoretical, framework, for, the, esoteric, buddhist, practices, of, mantrayana, bridging, the, gap, between, the, doctrine, of, the, sutras, and, tantric, practices, at, the, foundation, of, k, kai, s, thought, is, the, trikaya, doctrine, which, holds, there, are, three, bodies, of, the, buddha, according, to, k, kai, esoteric, buddhism, has, the, dharmakaya, jpn, hosshin, embodiment, of, truth, as, its, source, which, is, associated, with, vairocana, buddha, dainichi, hosshin, is, embodied, absolute, reality, and, truth, hosshin, is, mostly, ineffable, but, can, be, experienced, through, esoteric, practices, such, as, mudras, and, mantras, while, mahayana, is, taught, by, the, historical, buddha, nirm, ak, ya, it, does, not, have, ultimate, reality, as, its, source, or, the, practices, to, experience, the, esoteric, truth, for, shingon, from, an, enlightened, perspective, the, whole, phenomenal, world, itself, is, also, the, teaching, of, vairocana, the, body, of, the, world, its, sounds, and, movements, is, the, body, of, truth, dharma, and, furthermore, it, is, also, identical, with, the, personal, body, of, the, cosmic, buddha, for, k, kai, world, actions, persons, and, buddhas, are, all, part, of, the, cosmic, monologue, of, vairocana, they, are, the, truth, being, preached, to, its, own, self, manifestations, this, is, hosshin, sepp, literally, the, dharmak, ya, s, expounding, of, the, dharma, which, can, be, accessed, through, mantra, which, is, the, cosmic, language, of, vairocana, emanating, through, cosmic, vibration, concentrated, in, sound, in, a, broad, sense, the, universe, itself, is, a, huge, text, expressing, ultimate, truth, dharma, which, must, be, read, dainichi, means, great, sun, and, k, kai, uses, this, as, a, metaphor, for, the, great, primordial, buddha, whose, teaching, and, presence, illuminates, and, pervades, all, like, the, light, of, the, sun, this, immanent, presence, also, means, that, every, being, already, has, access, to, the, liberated, state, hongaku, and, buddha, nature, and, that, because, of, this, there, is, the, possibility, of, becoming, buddha, in, this, very, embodied, existence, sokushinj, butsu, this, is, achieved, because, of, the, non, dual, relationship, between, the, macrocosm, of, hosshin, and, the, microcosm, of, the, shingon, practitioner, k, kai, s, exposition, of, what, has, been, called, shingon, s, metaphysics, is, based, on, the, three, aspects, of, the, cosmic, truth, or, hosshin, body, appearance, and, function, the, body, is, the, physical, and, mental, elements, which, are, the, body, and, mind, of, the, cosmic, buddha, and, which, is, also, empty, shunyata, the, physical, universe, for, shingon, contains, the, interconnected, mental, and, physical, events, the, appearance, aspect, is, the, form, of, the, world, which, appears, as, mandalas, of, interconnected, realms, and, is, depicted, in, mandala, art, such, as, the, womb, realm, mandala, the, function, is, the, movement, and, change, which, happens, in, the, world, which, includes, change, in, forms, sounds, and, thought, these, forms, sounds, and, thoughts, are, expressed, by, the, shingon, practitioner, in, various, rituals, and, tantric, practices, which, allow, them, to, connect, with, and, inter, resonate, with, dainichi, and, hence, attain, liberation, here, and, now, in, sri, lanka, buddhist, modernists, such, as, anagarika, dharmapala, 1864, 1933, and, the, american, convert, henry, steel, olcott, sought, to, show, that, buddhism, was, rational, and, compatible, with, modern, scientific, ideas, such, as, the, theory, of, evolution, dharmapala, also, argued, that, buddhism, included, a, strong, social, element, interpreting, it, as, liberal,

chinese, pinyin, r, nsh, ng, f, ji, o, which, was, free, of, supernatural, beliefs, taixu, also, wrote, on, the, connections, between, modern, science, and, buddhism, ultimately, holding, that,
