the, p, li, canon, is, the, standard, collection, of, scriptures, in, the, theravada, buddhist, tradition, as, preserved, in, the, p, li, language, it, is, the, most, complete, extant, early, buddhist, canon, it, derives, mainly, from, the, tamrashatiya, school, during, the, first, buddhist, council, three, months, after, the, parinibbana, of, gautama, buddha, in, rajgir, ananda, recited, the, sutta, pitaka, and, upali, recited, the, vinaya, pitaka, the, arhats, present, accepted, the, recitations, and, henceforth, the, teachings, were, preserved, orally, by, the, sangha, the, tipitaka, that, was, transmitted, to, sri, lanka, during, the, reign, of, king, asoka, was, initially, preserved, orally, and, was, later, written, down, on, palm, leaves, during, the, fourth, buddhist, council, in, 29, bc, approximately, 454, years, after, the, death, of, gautama, buddha, the, claim, that, the, texts, were, spoken, by, the, buddha, is, meant, in, this, non, literal, sense, the, existence, of, the, bhanaka, tradition, existing, until, later, periods, along, with, other, sources, shows, that, oral, tradition, continued, to, exist, side, by, side, with, written, scriptures, for, many, centuries, to, come, thus, the, so, called, writing, down, of, the, scriptures, was, only, the, beginning, of, a, new, form, of, tradition, and, the, innovation, was, probably, opposed, by, the, more, conservative, monks, as, with, many, other, innovations, it, was, only, after, some, time, that, it, was, generally, accepted, therefore, it, was, much, later, that, the, records, of, this, event, were, transformed, into, an, account, of, a, council, sangayana, or, sangiti, which, was, held, under, the, patronage, of, king, vattagamani, textual, fragments, of, similar, teachings, have, been, found, in, the, agama, of, other, major, buddhist, schools, in, india, they, were, however, written, down, in, various, prakrits, other, than, pali, as, well, as, sanskrit, some, of, those, were, later, translated, into, chinese, earliest, dating, to, the, late, 4th, century, ad, the, surviving, sri, lankan, version, is, the, most, complete, but, was, extensively, redacted, about, 1, 000, years, after, buddha, s, death, in, the, 5th, or, 6th, century, ce, the, earliest, textual, fragments, of, canonical, pali, were, found, in, the, pyu, city, states, in, burma, dating, only, to, the, mid, 5th, to, mid, 6th, century, ce, the, p, li, canon, falls, into, three, general, categories, called, pitaka, from, pali, pi, aka, meaning, basket, referring, to, the, receptacles, in, which, the, palm, leaf, manuscripts, were, kept, thus, the, canon, is, traditionally, known, as, the, tipi, aka, three, baskets, the, three, pitakas, are, as, follows, the, vinaya, pitaka, and, the, sutta, pitaka, are, remarkably, similar, to, the, works, of, the, early, buddhist, schools, often, termed, early, buddhist, texts, the, abhidhamma, pitaka, however, is, a, strictly, theravada, collection, and, has, little, in, common, with, the, abhidhamma, works, recognized, by, other, buddhist, schools, the, canon, is, traditionally, described, by, the, theravada, as, the, word, of, the, buddha, buddhavacana, though, this, is, not, intended, in, a, literal, sense, since, it, includes, teachings, by, disciples, the, traditional, therav, din, mahavih, rin, interpretation, of, the, pali, canon, is, given, in, a, series, of, commentaries, covering, nearly, the, whole, canon, compiled, by, buddhaghosa, fl, 4th, 5th, century, ad, and, later, monks, mainly, on, the, basis, of, earlier, materials, now, lost, subcommentaries, were, written, afterward, commenting, further, on, the, canon, and, its, commentaries, the, traditional, therav, din, interpretation, is, summarized, in, buddhaghosa, s, visuddhimagga, a, spokesman, for, the, buddha, sasana, council, of, burma, states, that, the, canon, contains, everything, needed, to, show, the, path, to, nirv, na, the, commentaries, and, subcommentaries, sometimes, include, much, speculative, matter, but, are, faithful, to, its, teachings, and, often, give, very, illuminating, illustrations, in, sri, lanka, and, thailand, official, buddhism, has, in, large, part, adopted, the, interpretations, of, western, scholars, although, the, canon, has, existed, in, written, form, for, two, millennia, its, earlier, oral, nature, has, not, been, forgotten, in, buddhist, practice, memorization, and, recitation, remain, common, among, frequently, recited, texts, are, the, paritta, even, lay, people, usually, know, at, least, a, few, short, texts, by, heart, and, recite, them, regularly, this, is, considered, a, form, of, meditation, at, least, if, one, understands, the, meaning, monks, are, of, course, expected, to, know, quite, a, bit, more, see, dhammapada, below, for, an, example, a, burmese, monk, named, vicittasara, even, learned, the, entire, canon, by, heart, for, the, sixth, council, again, according, to, the, usual, theravada, numbering, the, relation, of, the, scriptures, to, buddhism, as, it, actually, exists, among, ordinary, monks, and, lay, people, is, as, with, other, major, religious, traditions, problematic, the, evidence, suggests, that, only, parts, of, the, canon, ever, enjoyed, wide, currency, and, that, non, canonical, works, were, sometimes, much, more, widely, used, the, details, varied, from, place, to, place, rupert, gethin, suggests, that, the, whole, of, buddhist, history, may, be, regarded, as, a, working, out, of, the, implications, of, the, early, scriptures, according, to, a, late, part, of, the, pali, canon, the, buddha, taught, the, three, pitakas, it, is, traditionally, believed, by, theravadins, that, most, of, the, pali, canon, originated, from, the, buddha, and, his, immediate, disciples, according, to, the, scriptures, a, council, was, held, shortly, after, the, buddha, s, passing, to, collect, and, preserve, his, teachings, the, theravada, tradition, states, that, the, canon, was, recited, orally, from, the, 5th, century, to, the, first, century, bc, when, it, was, written, down, the, memorization, was, reinforced, by, regular, communal, recitations, the, tradition, holds, that, only, a, few, later, additions, were, made, the, therav, din, pitakas, were, first, written, down, in, sri, lanka, in, the, alu, viharaya, temple, no, earlier, than, 29, 17, bc, the, geographic, setting, of, identifiable, texts, within, the, canon, generally, corresponds, to, locations, in, the, ganges, region, of, northeastern, india, including, the, kingdoms, of, kosala, kasi, vajji, and, magadha, while, theravada, tradition, has, generally, regarded, pali, as, being, synonymous, with, the, language, of, the, kingdom, of, magadhi, as, spoken, by, the, buddha, linguists, have, identified, pali, as, being, more, closely, related, to, other, prakrit, languages, of, western, india, and, found, substantial, incompatibilities, with, the, few, preserved, examples, of, magadhi, and, other, north, eastern, prakrit, languages, linguistic, research, suggests, that, the, teachings, of, the, buddha, may, have, been, recorded, in, an, eastern, indian, language, originally, and, transposed, into, the, west, indian, precursor, of, pali, sometime, before, the, asokan, era, much, of, the, material, in, the, canon, is, not, specifically, therav, din, but, is, instead, the, collection, of, teachings, that, this, school, preserved, from, the, early, non, sectarian, body, of, teachings, according, to, peter, harvey, it, contains, material, which, is, at, odds, with, later, therav, din, orthodoxy, he, states, that, the, therav, dins, then, may, have, added, texts, to, the, canon, for, some, time, but, they, do, not, appear, to, have, tampered, with, what, they, already, had, from, an, earlier, period, a, variety, of, factors, suggest, that, the, early, sri, lankan, buddhists, regarded, canonical, literature, as, such, and, transmitted, it, conservatively, theravada, tradition, generally, treats, the, canon, as, a, whole, as, originating, with, the, buddha, and, his, immediate, disciples, with, the, exception, of, certain, generally, abhidhamma, texts, that, explicitly, refer, to, events, long, after, his, death, scholars, differ, in, their, views, regarding, the, origin, of, the, pali, canon, but, generally, believe, that, the, canon, includes, several, strata, of, relatively, early, and, late, texts, but, with, little, consensus, regarding, the, relative, dating, of, different, sections, of, the, canon, or, which, texts, belong, to, which, era, prayudh, payutto, argues, that, the, pali, canon, represents, the, teachings, of, the, buddha, essentially, unchanged, apart, from, minor, modifications, he, argues, that, it, also, incorporates, teachings, that, precede, the, buddha, and, that, the, later, teachings, were, memorized, by, the, buddha, s, followers, while, he, was, still, alive, his, thesis, is, based, on, study, of, the, processes, of, the, first, great, council, and, the, methods, for, memorization, used, by, the, monks, which, started, during, the, buddha, s, lifetime, it, s, also, based, on, the, capability, of, a, few, monks, to, this, day, to, memorize, the, entire, canon, bhikkhu, sujato, and, bhikkhu, brahmali, argue, that, it, is, likely, that, much, of, the, pali, canon, dates, back, to, the, time, period, of, the, buddha, they, base, this, on, many, lines, of, evidence, including, the, technology, described, in, the, canon, apart, from, the, obviously, later, texts, which, matches, the, technology, of, his, day, which, was, in, rapid, development, that, it, doesn, t, include, back, written, prophecies, of, the, great, buddhist, ruler, king, ashoka, which, mahayana, texts, often, do, suggesting, that, it, predates, his, time, that, in, its, descriptions, of, the, political, geography, it, presents, india, at, the, time, of, buddha, which, changed, soon, after, his, death, that, it, has, no, mention, of, places, in, south, india, which, would, have, been, well, known, to, indians, not, long, after, buddha, s, death, and, various, other, lines, of, evidence, dating, the, material, back, to, his, time, the, views, of, scholars, concerning, the, authorship, of, the, pali, canon, can, be, grouped, into, three, categories, several, scholars, of, early, buddhism, argue, that, the, nucleus, of, the, buddhist, teachings, in, the, pali, canon, may, derive, from, gautama, buddha, himself, but, that, part, of, it, also, was, developed, after, the, buddha, by, his, early, followers, richard, gombrich, says, that, the, main, preachings, of, the, buddha, as, in, the, vinaya, and, sutta, pitaka, are, coherent, and, cogent, and, must, be, the, work, of, a, single, person, the, buddha, himself, not, a, committee, of, followers, after, his, death, other, scholars, are, more, cautious, and, attribute, part, of, the, pali, canon, to, the, buddha, s, early, followers, peter, harvey, states, that, much, of, the, pali, canon, must, derive, from, the, buddha, s, teaching, but, also, that, parts, of, the, pali, canon, clearly, originated, after, the, time, of, the, buddha, a, k, warder, stated, that, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, shared, teaching, of, the, early, schools, was, formulated, by, anyone, else, than, the, buddha, and, his, immediate, followers, j, w, de, jong, said, it, would, be, hypocritical, to, assert, that, we, can, say, nothing, about, the, teachings, of, earliest, buddhism, arguing, that, the, basic, ideas, of, buddhism, found, in, the, canonical, writings, could, very, well, have, been, proclaimed, by, him, transmitted, and, developed, by, his, disciples, and, finally, codified, in, fixed, formulas, alex, wynne, said, that, some, texts, in, the, pali, canon, may, go, back, to, the, very, beginning, of, buddhism, which, perhaps, include, the, substance, of, the, buddha, s, teaching, and, in, some, cases, maybe, even, his, words, he, suggests, the, canon, was, composed, soon, after, buddha, s, paranirvana, but, after, a, period, of, free, improvisation, and, then, the, core, teachings, were, preserved, nearly, verbatim, by, memory, hajime, nakamura, writes, that, while, nothing, can, be, definitively, attributed, to, gautama, as, a, historical, figure, some, sayings, or, phrases, must, derive, from, him, most, scholars, agree, there, was, a, rough, body, of, sacred, literature, that, an, early, community, maintained, and, transmitted, much, of, the, pali, canon, is, found, also, in, the, scriptures, of, other, early, schools, of, buddhism, parts, of, whose, versions, are, preserved, mainly, in, chinese, many, scholars, have, argued, that, this, shared, material, can, be, attributed, to, the, period, of, pre, sectarian, buddhism, this, is, the, period, before, the, early, schools, separated, in, about, the, fourth, or, third, century, bc, some, scholars, see, the, pali, canon, as, expanding, and, changing, from, an, unknown, nucleus, arguments, given, for, an, agnostic, attitude, include, that, the, evidence, for, the, buddha, s, teachings, dates, from, long, after, his, death, some, scholars, of, later, indian, buddhism, and, tibetan, buddhism, say, that, little, or, nothing, goes, back, to, the, buddha, ronald, davidson, has, little, confidence, that, much, if, any, of, surviving, buddhist, scripture, is, actually, the, word, of, the, historical, buddha, geoffrey, samuel, says, the, pali, canon, largely, derives, from, the, work, of, buddhaghosa, and, his, colleagues, in, the, 5th, century, ad, gregory, schopen, argues, that, it, is, not, until, the, 5th, to, 6th, centuries, ad, that, we, have, any, definite, evidence, about, the, contents, of, the, canon, this, position, was, criticized, by, a, wynne, western, scholarship, suggests, that, the, composition, of, the, abhidhamma, pitaka, likely, began, around, 300, bce, but, may, have, drawn, on, an, earlier, tradition, of, lists, and, rubrics, known, as, matrika, traditional, accounts, include, it, among, the, texts, recited, at, the, first, buddhist, council, and, attribute, differences, in, form, and, style, to, its, composition, by, sariputra, opinions, differ, on, what, the, earliest, books, of, the, canon, are, the, majority, of, western, scholars, consider, the, earliest, identifiable, stratum, to, be, mainly, prose, works, the, vinaya, excluding, the, pariv, ra, and, the, first, four, nik, yas, of, the, sutta, pitaka, and, perhaps, also, some, short, verse, works, such, as, the, suttanipata, however, some, scholars, particularly, in, japan, maintain, that, the, suttanip, ta, is, the, earliest, of, all, buddhist, scriptures, followed, by, the, itivuttaka, and, ud, na, however, some, of, the, developments, in, teachings, may, only, reflect, changes, in, teaching, that, the, buddha, himself, adopted, during, the, 45, years, that, the, buddha, was, teaching, scholars, generally, agree, that, the, early, books, include, some, later, additions, aspects, of, these, late, additions, are, or, may, be, from, a, much, earlier, period, aspects, of, the, pali, canon, such, as, what, it, says, about, society, and, south, asian, history, are, in, doubt, because, the, pali, canon, was, extensively, redacted, in, the, 5th, or, 6th, century, ad, nearly, a, thousand, years, after, the, death, of, the, buddha, further, this, redacted, pali, canon, of, sri, lanka, itself, mentions, that, it, was, previously, redacted, towards, the, end, of, 1st, century, bc, according, to, early, buddhism, scholar, lars, fogelin, the, pali, canon, of, sri, lanka, is, a, modified, canon, and, there, is, no, good, reason, to, assume, that, sri, lankan, buddhism, resembles, early, buddhism, in, the, mainland, and, there, are, numerous, reasons, to, argue, that, it, does, not, dr, peter, masefield, m, p, t, s, researched, a, form, of, pali, known, as, indochinese, pali, or, kham, pali, it, had, been, considered, a, degraded, form, of, pali, but, masefield, states, that, further, examination, of, texts, will, probably, show, it, is, an, internally, consistent, pali, dialect, the, reason, for, the, changes, is, that, some, combinations, of, characters, are, difficult, to, write, in, those, scripts, masefield, says, records, in, thailand, state, that, upon, the, third, re, introduction, of, theravada, buddhism, into, sri, lanka, the, siyamese, sect, large, number, of, texts, were, also, taken, when, monastic, ordination, died, out, in, sri, lanka, many, texts, were, lost, also, therefore, the, sri, lankan, pali, canon, had, been, translated, first, into, indo, chinese, pali, and, then, at, least, in, part, back, again, into, pali, one, of, the, edicts, of, ashoka, the, calcutta, bairat, edict, lists, several, works, from, the, canon, which, ashoka, considered, advantageous, according, to, alexander, wynne, the, general, consensus, seems, to, be, that, what, asoka, calls, munigatha, correspond, to, the, munisutta, sn, 207, 221, moneyasute, is, probably, the, second, half, of, the, nalakasutta, sn, 699, 723, and, upatisapasine, may, correspond, to, the, sariputtasutta, sn, 955, 975, the, identification, of, most, of, the, other, titles, is, less, certain, but, schmithausen, following, oldenberg, before, him, identifies, what, asoka, calls, the, laghulovada, with, part, of, a, prose, text, in, the, majjhima, nikaya, the, ambalatthika, rahulovada, sutta, m, no, 61, this, seems, to, be, evidence, that, some, of, these, texts, were, already, fixed, by, the, time, of, the, reign, of, ashoka, 304, 232, bc, which, means, that, some, of, the, texts, carried, by, the, buddhist, missionaries, at, this, time, might, also, have, been, fixed, according, to, the, sri, lankan, mahavamsa, the, pali, canon, was, written, down, in, the, reign, of, king, vattag, mini, va, ag, mi, i, 1st, century, bce, in, sri, lanka, at, the, fourth, buddhist, council, most, scholars, hold, that, little, if, anything, was, added, to, the, canon, after, this, though, schopen, questions, this, the, climate, of, therav, da, countries, is, not, conducive, to, the, survival, of, manuscripts, apart, from, brief, quotations, in, inscriptions, and, a, two, page, fragment, from, the, eighth, or, ninth, century, found, in, nepal, the, oldest, manuscripts, known, are, from, late, in, the, fifteenth, century, and, there, is, not, very, much, from, before, the, eighteenth, the, first, complete, printed, edition, of, the, canon, was, published, in, burma, in, 1900, in, 38, volumes, the, following, editions, of, the, pali, text, of, the, canon, are, readily, available, in, the, west, pali, canon, in, english, translation, 1895, in, progress, 43, volumes, so, far, pali, text, society, bristol, for, details, of, these, and, other, translations, of, individual, books, see, the, separate, articles, in, 1994, the, then, president, of, the, pali, text, society, stated, that, most, of, these, translations, were, unsatisfactory, another, former, president, said, in, 2003, that, most, of, the, translations, were, done, very, badly, the, style, of, many, translations, from, the, canon, has, been, criticized, as, buddhist, hybrid, english, a, term, invented, by, paul, griffiths, for, translations, from, sanskrit, he, describes, it, as, deplorable, comprehensible, only, to, the, initiate, written, by, and, for, buddhologists, selections, see, list, of, pali, canon, anthologies, a, translation, by, bhikkhu, nanamoli, and, bhikkhu, bodhi, of, the, majjhima, nikaya, was, published, by, wisdom, publications, in, 1995, translations, by, bhikkhu, bodhi, of, the, samyutta, nikaya, and, the, anguttara, nikaya, were, published, by, wisdom, publications, in, 2003, and, 2012, respectively, in, 2018, new, translations, of, the, entirety, of, the, five, nikayas, were, made, freely, available, on, the, website, suttacentral, by, the, australian, bhikkhu, sujato, the, translations, were, also, released, into, the, public, domain, a, japanese, translation, of, the, canon, edited, by, takakusu, junjiro, was, published, in, 65, volumes, from, 1935, to, 1941, as, the, mah, tripi, aka, of, the, southern, tradition, nanden, daiz, ky, a, chinese, translation, of, the, above, mentioned, japanese, translation, was, undertaken, between, 1990, 1998, and, thereafter, printed, under, the, patronage, of, kaoshiung, s, yuan, heng, temple, as, noted, above, the, canon, consists, of, three, pitakas, details, are, given, below, for, more, complete, information, see, standard, references, on, pali, literature, the, first, category, the, vinaya, pitaka, is, mostly, concerned, with, the, rules, of, the, sangha, both, monks, and, nuns, the, rules, are, preceded, by, stories, telling, how, the, buddha, came, to, lay, them, down, and, followed, by, explanations, and, analysis, according, to, the, stories, the, rules, were, devised, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, as, the, buddha, encountered, various, behavioral, problems, or, disputes, among, his, followers, this, pitaka, can, be, divided, into, three, parts, the, second, category, is, the, sutta, pitaka, literally, basket, of, threads, or, of, the, well, spoken, sanskrit, sutra, pitaka, following, the, former, meaning, which, consists, primarily, of, accounts, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, the, sutta, pitaka, has, five, subdivisions, or, nikayas, the, third, category, the, abhidhamma, pitaka, literally, beyond, the, dhamma, higher, dhamma, or, special, dhamma, sanskrit, abhidharma, pitaka, is, a, collection, of, texts, which, give, a, scholastic, explanation, of, buddhist, doctrines, particularly, about, mind, and, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, systematic, philosophy, basket, there, are, seven, books, in, the, abhidhamma, pitaka, the, traditional, position, is, that, abhidhamma, refers, to, the, absolute, teaching, while, the, suttas, are, adapted, to, the, hearer, most, scholars, describe, the, abhidhamma, as, an, attempt, to, systematize, the, teachings, of, the, suttas, cousins, says, that, where, the, suttas, think, in, terms, of, sequences, or, processes, the, abhidhamma, thinks, in, terms, of, specific, events, or, occasions, the, pali, canon, uses, many, brahmanical, terminology, and, concepts, for, example, the, sundarika, sutta, includes, an, analogy, quoted, in, several, other, places, in, the, canon, where, the, buddha, describes, the, agnihotra, as, the, foremost, sacrifice, and, the, gayatri, mantra, as, the, foremost, meter, aggihuttamukh, ya, s, vitt, chandaso, mukham, these, brahmanical, motives, are, sometimes, introduced, in, order, to, establish, a, link, with, the, deeds, and, beliefs, of, brahmins, referencing, shared, ideas, that, were, part, of, the, culture, of, ancient, india, in, many, other, instances, they, are, introduced, in, order, to, establish, unfavorable, comparisons, with, buddhist, teachings, or, practices, after, identifying, the, fire, sacrifice, as, the, foremost, of, the, brahminist, sacrifices, the, buddha, goes, on, to, explain, how, it, is, surpassed, by, the, kindling, of, inner, light, that, he, practices, as, an, arhat, the, other, two, main, buddhist, canons, in, use, in, the, present, day, are, the, chinese, buddhist, canon, and, the, tibetan, kangyur, the, standard, modern, edition, of, the, chinese, buddhist, canon, is, the, taish, revised, tripi, aka, with, a, hundred, major, divisions, totaling, over, 80, 000, pages, this, includes, vinayas, for, the, dharmaguptaka, sarv, stiv, da, mah, saka, and, mah, sa, ghika, schools, it, also, includes, the, four, major, gamas, which, are, analogous, to, the, nikayas, of, the, pali, canon, namely, they, are, the, sa, yukta, gama, madhyama, gama, d, rgha, gama, and, ekottara, gama, also, included, are, the, dhammapada, the, ud, na, the, itivuttaka, and, milindapanha, there, are, also, additional, texts, including, early, histories, that, are, preserved, from, the, early, buddhist, schools, but, not, found, in, pali, the, canon, contains, voluminous, works, of, abhidharma, especially, from, the, sarv, stiv, da, school, the, indian, works, preserved, in, the, chinese, canon, were, translated, mostly, from, buddhist, hybrid, sanskrit, classical, sanskrit, or, from, regional, prakrits, the, chinese, generally, referred, to, these, simply, as, sanskrit, ch, f, ny, the, first, woodblock, printing, of, the, entire, chinese, buddhist, canon, was, done, during, the, song, dynasty, by, imperial, order, in, china, in, ad, 971, the, earliest, dated, printed, buddhist, sutra, was, the, diamond, sutra, printed, in, ad, 868, printed, by, an, up, saka, for, free, distribution, although, printing, of, individual, buddhist, sutras, and, related, materials, may, have, started, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, ad, the, tibetan, kangyur, comprises, about, a, hundred, volumes, and, includes, versions, of, the, vinaya, pitaka, the, dhammapada, under, the, title, udanavarga, and, parts, of, some, other, books, due, to, the, later, compilation, it, contains, comparatively, fewer, early, buddhist, texts, than, the, pali, and, chinese, canons, the, chinese, and, tibetan, canons, are, not, translations, of, the, pali, and, differ, from, it, to, varying, extents, but, contain, some, recognizably, similar, early, works, however, the, abhidharma, books, are, fundamentally, different, works, from, the, pali, abhidhamma, pitaka, the, chinese, and, tibetan, canons, also, consist, of, mah, y, na, s, tras, and, vajray, na, tantras, which, have, few, parallels, in, the, pali, canon
