in, christian, belief, a, saint, is, a, person, who, is, recognized, as, having, an, exceptional, degree, of, holiness, likeness, or, closeness, to, god, however, the, use, of, the, term, saint, depends, on, the, context, and, denomination, in, catholic, eastern, orthodox, anglican, oriental, orthodox, and, lutheran, doctrine, all, of, their, faithful, deceased, in, heaven, are, considered, to, be, saints, but, some, are, considered, worthy, of, greater, honor, or, emulation, official, ecclesiastical, recognition, and, consequently, a, public, cult, of, veneration, is, conferred, on, some, denominational, saints, through, the, process, of, canonization, in, the, catholic, church, or, glorification, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, after, their, approval, while, the, english, word, saint, originated, in, christianity, historians, of, religion, tend, to, use, the, appellation, in, a, more, general, way, to, refer, to, the, state, of, special, holiness, that, many, religions, attribute, to, certain, people, referring, to, the, jewish, as, d, or, tzadik, the, islamic, wal, fakir, the, hindu, rishi, sikh, bhagat, or, guru, the, shintoist, kami, the, taoist, shengren, and, the, buddhist, arhat, or, bodhisattva, also, as, saints, depending, on, the, religion, saints, are, recognized, either, by, official, ecclesiastical, declaration, as, in, the, catholic, faith, or, by, popular, acclamation, see, folk, saint, the, english, word, saint, comes, from, the, latin, sanctus, with, the, greek, equivalent, being, hagios, holy, the, word, appears, 229, times, in, the, greek, new, testament, and, its, english, translation, 60, times, in, the, corresponding, text, of, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, the, word, sanctus, was, originally, a, technical, one, in, ancient, roman, religion, but, due, to, its, globalized, use, in, christianity, the, modern, word, saint, is, now, also, used, as, a, translation, of, comparable, terms, for, persons, worthy, of, veneration, for, their, holiness, or, sanctity, in, other, religions, many, religions, also, use, similar, concepts, but, different, terminology, to, venerate, persons, worthy, of, some, honor, author, john, a, coleman, of, the, graduate, theological, union, berkeley, california, wrote, that, saints, across, various, cultures, and, religions, have, the, following, family, resemblances, the, anthropologist, lawrence, babb, in, an, article, about, indian, guru, sathya, sai, baba, asks, the, question, who, is, a, saint, and, responds, by, saying, that, in, the, symbolic, infrastructure, of, some, religions, there, is, the, image, of, a, certain, extraordinary, spiritual, person, s, miraculous, powers, to, whom, frequently, a, certain, moral, presence, is, attributed, these, saintly, figures, he, asserts, are, the, focal, points, of, spiritual, force, fields, they, exert, powerful, attractive, influence, on, followers, but, touch, the, inner, lives, of, others, in, transforming, ways, as, well, according, to, the, catholic, church, a, saint, may, be, anyone, in, heaven, whether, recognized, on, earth, or, not, who, forms, the, great, cloud, of, witnesses, hebrews, 12, 1, these, may, include, our, own, mothers, grandmothers, or, other, loved, ones, cf, 2, tim, 1, 5, who, may, have, not, always, lived, perfect, lives, but, amid, their, faults, and, failings, they, kept, moving, forward, and, proved, pleasing, to, the, lord, the, title, saint, denotes, a, person, who, has, been, formally, canonized, that, is, officially, and, authoritatively, declared, a, saint, by, the, church, as, holder, of, the, keys, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, and, is, therefore, believed, to, be, in, heaven, by, the, grace, of, god, there, are, many, persons, that, the, church, believes, to, be, in, heaven, who, have, not, been, formally, canonized, and, who, are, otherwise, titled, saints, because, of, the, fame, of, their, holiness, sometimes, the, word, saint, also, denotes, living, christians, according, to, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, the, patriarchs, prophets, and, certain, other, old, testament, figures, have, been, and, always, will, be, honored, as, saints, in, all, the, church, s, liturgical, traditions, in, his, book, saint, of, the, day, editor, leonard, foley, says, this, the, surrender, to, god, s, love, was, so, generous, an, approach, to, the, total, surrender, of, jesus, that, the, church, recognizes, them, as, heroes, and, heroines, worthy, to, be, held, up, for, our, inspiration, they, remind, us, that, the, church, is, holy, can, never, stop, being, holy, and, is, called, to, show, the, holiness, of, god, by, living, the, life, of, christ, the, catholic, church, teaches, that, it, does, not, make, or, create, saints, but, rather, recognizes, them, proofs, of, heroic, virtue, required, in, the, process, of, beatification, will, serve, to, illustrate, in, detail, the, general, principles, exposed, above, upon, proof, of, their, holiness, or, likeness, to, god, on, 3, january, 993, pope, john, xv, became, the, first, pope, to, proclaim, a, person, a, saint, from, outside, the, diocese, of, rome, on, the, petition, of, the, german, ruler, he, had, canonized, bishop, ulrich, of, augsburg, before, that, time, the, popular, cults, or, venerations, of, saints, had, been, local, and, spontaneous, and, were, confirmed, by, the, local, bishop, pope, john, xviii, subsequently, permitted, a, cult, of, five, polish, martyrs, pope, benedict, viii, later, declared, the, armenian, hermit, simeon, of, mantua, to, be, a, saint, but, it, was, not, until, the, pontificate, of, pope, innocent, iii, that, the, popes, reserved, to, themselves, the, exclusive, authority, to, canonize, saints, so, that, local, bishops, needed, the, confirmation, of, the, pope, walter, of, pontoise, was, the, last, person, in, western, europe, to, be, canonized, by, an, authority, other, than, the, pope, hugh, de, boves, the, archbishop, of, rouen, canonized, him, in, 1153, thenceforth, a, decree, of, pope, alexander, iii, in, 1170, reserved, the, prerogative, of, canonization, to, the, pope, insofar, as, the, latin, church, was, concerned, alban, butler, published, lives, of, the, saints, in, 1756, including, a, total, of, 1, 486, saints, the, latest, revision, of, this, book, edited, by, herbert, thurston, and, donald, attwater, contains, the, lives, of, 2, 565, saints, robert, sarno, an, official, of, the, dicastery, for, the, causes, of, saints, of, the, holy, see, expressed, that, it, is, impossible, to, give, an, exact, number, of, saints, the, veneration, of, saints, in, latin, cultus, or, the, cult, of, the, saints, describes, a, particular, popular, devotion, or, entrustment, of, one, s, self, to, a, particular, saint, or, group, of, saints, although, the, term, worship, is, sometimes, used, it, is, only, used, with, the, older, english, connotation, of, honoring, or, respecting, dulia, a, person, according, to, the, church, divine, worship, is, in, the, strict, sense, reserved, only, to, god, latria, and, never, to, the, saints, one, is, permitted, to, ask, the, saints, to, intercede, or, pray, to, god, for, persons, still, on, earth, just, as, one, can, ask, someone, on, earth, to, pray, for, him, a, saint, may, be, designated, as, a, patron, saint, of, a, particular, cause, profession, or, locale, or, invoked, as, a, protector, against, specific, illnesses, or, disasters, sometimes, by, popular, custom, and, sometimes, by, official, declarations, of, the, church, saints, are, not, believed, to, have, power, of, their, own, but, only, that, granted, by, god, relics, of, saints, are, respected, or, venerated, similar, to, the, veneration, of, holy, images, and, icons, the, practice, in, past, centuries, of, venerating, relics, of, saints, with, the, intention, of, obtaining, healing, from, god, through, their, intercession, is, taken, from, the, early, church, for, example, an, american, deacon, claimed, in, 2000, that, john, henry, newman, then, blessed, interceded, with, god, to, cure, him, of, a, physical, illness, the, deacon, jack, sullivan, asserted, that, after, addressing, newman, he, was, cured, of, spinal, stenosis, in, a, matter, of, hours, in, 2009, a, panel, of, theologians, concluded, that, sullivan, s, recovery, was, the, result, of, his, prayer, to, newman, according, to, the, church, to, be, deemed, a, miracle, a, medical, recovery, must, be, instantaneous, not, attributable, to, treatment, disappear, for, good, once, a, person, has, been, canonized, the, deceased, body, of, the, saint, is, considered, holy, as, a, relic, the, remains, of, saints, are, called, holy, relics, and, are, usually, used, in, churches, saints, personal, belongings, may, also, be, used, as, relics, some, of, the, saints, have, a, special, symbol, by, tradition, e, g, saint, lawrence, deacon, and, martyr, is, identified, by, a, gridiron, because, he, is, believed, to, have, been, burned, to, death, on, one, this, symbol, is, found, for, instance, in, the, canadian, heraldry, of, the, office, responsible, for, the, st, lawrence, seaway, formal, canonization, is, a, lengthy, process, often, of, many, years, or, even, centuries, there, are, four, major, steps, to, become, a, saint, the, first, stage, in, this, process, is, an, investigation, of, the, candidate, s, life, by, an, expert, after, this, the, official, report, on, the, candidate, is, submitted, to, the, bishop, of, the, pertinent, diocese, and, more, study, is, undertaken, the, information, is, then, sent, to, the, dicastery, for, the, causes, of, saints, of, the, holy, see, for, evaluation, at, the, universal, level, of, the, church, if, the, application, is, approved, the, candidate, may, be, granted, the, title, venerable, stage, 2, further, investigation, step, 3, may, lead, to, the, candidate, s, beatification, with, the, title, blessed, which, is, elevation, to, the, class, of, the, beati, next, and, at, a, minimum, proof, of, two, important, miracles, obtained, from, god, through, the, intercession, of, the, candidate, are, required, for, formal, canonization, as, a, saint, finally, in, the, last, stage, after, all, of, these, procedures, are, complete, the, pope, may, canonize, the, candidate, as, a, saint, for, veneration, by, the, universal, church, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, a, saint, is, defined, as, anyone, who, is, in, heaven, whether, recognized, here, on, earth, or, not, by, this, definition, adam, and, eve, moses, the, various, prophets, and, archangels, are, all, given, the, title, of, saint, sainthood, in, the, orthodox, church, does, not, necessarily, reflect, a, moral, model, but, communion, with, god, there, are, countless, examples, of, people, who, lived, in, great, sin, and, became, saints, by, humility, and, repentance, such, as, mary, of, egypt, moses, the, ethiopian, and, dysmas, the, repentant, thief, who, was, crucified, therefore, a, more, complete, eastern, orthodox, definition, of, what, a, saint, is, has, to, do, with, the, way, that, saints, through, their, humility, and, their, love, of, humankind, saved, inside, them, the, entire, church, and, loved, all, people, orthodox, belief, considers, that, god, reveals, saints, through, answered, prayers, and, other, miracles, saints, are, usually, recognized, by, a, local, community, often, by, people, who, directly, knew, them, as, their, popularity, grows, they, are, often, then, recognized, by, the, entire, church, through, the, holy, spirit, the, word, canonization, means, that, a, christian, has, been, found, worthy, to, have, his, name, placed, in, the, canon, official, list, of, saints, of, the, church, the, formal, process, of, recognition, involves, deliberation, by, a, synod, of, bishops, the, orthodox, church, does, not, require, the, manifestation, of, miracles, what, is, required, is, evidence, of, a, virtuous, life, if, the, ecclesiastical, review, is, successful, this, is, followed, by, a, service, of, glorification, in, which, the, saint, is, given, a, day, on, the, church, calendar, to, be, celebrated, by, the, entire, church, this, does, not, however, make, the, person, a, saint, the, person, already, was, a, saint, and, the, church, ultimately, recognized, it, as, a, general, rule, only, clergy, will, touch, relics, in, order, to, move, them, or, carry, them, in, procession, however, in, veneration, the, faithful, will, kiss, the, relic, to, show, love, and, respect, toward, the, saint, the, altar, in, an, orthodox, church, usually, contains, relics, of, saints, often, of, martyrs, church, interiors, are, covered, with, the, icons, of, saints, when, an, orthodox, christian, venerates, icons, of, a, saint, he, is, venerating, the, image, of, god, which, he, sees, in, the, saint, because, the, church, shows, no, true, distinction, between, the, living, and, the, dead, as, the, saints, are, considered, to, be, alive, in, heaven, saints, are, referred, to, as, if, they, are, still, alive, and, are, venerated, not, worshipped, they, are, believed, to, be, able, to, intercede, for, salvation, and, help, mankind, either, through, direct, communion, with, god, or, by, personal, intervention, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, title, hosios, f, hosia, is, also, used, this, is, a, title, attributed, to, saints, who, had, lived, a, monastic, or, eremitic, life, equivalent, to, the, more, usual, title, of, saint, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, the, armenian, apostolic, church, the, coptic, orthodox, church, of, alexandria, the, tewahedo, church, malankara, syrian, orthodox, church, and, the, syriac, orthodox, church, follow, a, canonization, process, unique, to, each, church, the, coptic, orthodox, church, of, alexandria, for, example, has, the, requirement, that, at, least, 50, years, must, pass, following, a, prospective, saint, s, death, before, the, coptic, orthodox, church, s, pope, can, canonize, the, saint, in, the, anglican, communion, and, the, continuing, anglican, movement, the, title, of, saint, refers, to, a, person, who, has, been, elevated, by, popular, opinion, as, a, pious, and, holy, person, the, saints, are, seen, as, models, of, holiness, to, be, imitated, and, as, a, cloud, of, witnesses, that, strengthen, and, encourage, the, believer, during, his, or, her, spiritual, journey, hebrews, 12, 1, the, saints, are, seen, as, elder, brothers, and, sisters, in, christ, official, anglican, creeds, recognize, the, existence, of, the, saints, in, heaven, in, high, church, contexts, such, as, anglo, catholicism, a, saint, is, generally, one, to, whom, has, been, attributed, and, who, has, generally, demonstrated, a, high, level, of, holiness, and, sanctity, in, this, use, a, saint, is, therefore, not, merely, a, believer, but, one, who, has, been, transformed, by, virtue, in, catholicism, a, saint, is, a, special, sign, of, god, s, activity, the, veneration, of, saints, is, sometimes, misunderstood, to, be, worship, in, which, case, it, is, derisively, termed, hagiolatry, so, far, as, invocation, of, the, saints, is, concerned, one, of, the, church, of, england, s, articles, of, religion, of, purgatory, condemns, the, romish, doctrine, concerning, the, invocation, of, saints, as, a, fond, thing, vainly, invented, and, grounded, upon, no, warranty, of, scripture, but, rather, repugnant, to, the, word, of, god, anglo, catholics, in, anglican, provinces, using, the, articles, often, make, a, distinction, between, a, romish, and, a, patristic, doctrine, concerning, the, invocation, of, saints, permitting, the, latter, in, accordance, with, article, xxii, indeed, the, theologian, e, j, bicknell, stated, that, the, anglican, view, acknowledges, that, the, term, invocation, may, mean, either, of, two, things, the, simple, request, to, a, saint, for, his, prayers, intercession, ora, pro, nobis, or, a, request, for, some, particular, benefit, in, medieval, times, the, saints, had, come, to, be, regarded, as, themselves, the, authors, of, blessings, such, a, view, was, condemned, but, the, former, was, affirmed, some, anglicans, and, anglican, churches, particularly, anglo, catholics, personally, ask, prayers, of, the, saints, however, such, a, practice, is, seldom, found, in, any, official, anglican, liturgy, unusual, examples, of, it, are, found, in, the, korean, liturgy, 1938, the, liturgy, of, the, diocese, of, guiana, 1959, and, the, melanesian, english, prayer, book, anglicans, believe, that, the, only, effective, mediator, between, the, believer, and, god, the, father, in, terms, of, redemption, and, salvation, is, god, the, son, jesus, christ, historical, anglicanism, has, drawn, a, distinction, between, the, intercession, of, the, saints, and, the, invocation, of, the, saints, the, former, was, generally, accepted, in, anglican, doctrine, while, the, latter, was, generally, rejected, there, are, some, however, in, anglicanism, who, do, beseech, the, saints, intercession, those, who, beseech, the, saints, to, intercede, on, their, behalf, make, a, distinction, between, mediator, and, intercessor, and, claim, that, asking, for, the, prayers, of, the, saints, is, no, different, in, kind, than, asking, for, the, prayers, of, living, christians, anglican, catholics, understand, sainthood, in, a, more, catholic, or, orthodox, way, often, praying, for, intercessions, from, the, saints, and, celebrating, their, feast, days, according, to, the, church, of, england, a, saint, is, one, who, is, sanctified, as, it, translates, in, the, authorized, king, james, version, 1611, 2, chronicles, 6, 41, now, therefore, arise, o, l, ord, god, into, thy, resting, place, thou, and, the, ark, of, thy, strength, let, thy, priests, o, l, ord, god, be, clothed, with, salvation, and, let, thy, saints, rejoice, in, goodness, in, the, lutheran, church, all, christians, whether, in, heaven, or, on, earth, are, regarded, as, saints, however, the, church, still, recognizes, and, honors, specific, saints, including, some, of, those, recognized, by, the, catholic, church, but, in, a, qualified, way, according, to, the, augsburg, confession, the, term, saint, is, used, in, the, manner, of, the, catholic, church, only, insofar, as, to, denote, a, person, who, received, exceptional, grace, was, sustained, by, faith, and, whose, good, works, are, to, be, an, example, to, any, christian, traditional, lutheran, belief, accounts, that, prayers, to, the, saints, are, prohibited, as, they, are, not, mediators, of, redemption, but, lutherans, do, believe, that, saints, pray, for, the, christian, church, in, general, philip, melanchthon, the, author, of, the, apology, of, the, augsburg, confession, approved, honoring, the, saints, by, saying, they, are, honored, in, three, ways, the, lutheran, churches, also, have, liturgical, calendars, in, which, they, honor, individuals, as, saints, the, intercession, of, saints, was, criticized, in, the, augsburg, confession, article, xxi, of, the, worship, of, the, saints, this, criticism, was, rebutted, by, the, catholic, side, in, the, confutatio, augustana, which, in, turn, was, rebutted, by, the, lutheran, side, in, the, apology, to, the, augsburg, confession, while, methodists, as, a, whole, do, not, venerate, saints, they, do, honor, and, admire, them, methodists, believe, that, all, christians, are, saints, but, mainly, use, the, term, to, refer, to, biblical, figures, christian, leaders, and, martyrs, of, the, faith, many, methodist, churches, are, named, after, saints, such, as, the, twelve, apostles, john, wesley, etc, although, most, are, named, after, geographical, locations, associated, with, an, early, circuit, or, prominent, location, methodist, congregations, observe, all, saints, day, many, encourage, the, study, of, saints, that, is, the, biographies, of, holy, people, the, 14th, article, of, religion, in, the, united, methodist, book, of, discipline, states, the, romish, doctrine, concerning, purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and, adoration, as, well, of, images, as, of, relics, and, also, invocation, of, saints, is, a, fond, thing, vainly, invented, and, grounded, upon, no, warrant, of, scripture, but, repugnant, to, the, word, of, god, in, many, protestant, churches, the, word, saint, is, used, more, generally, to, refer, to, anyone, who, is, a, christian, this, is, similar, in, usage, to, paul, s, numerous, references, in, the, new, testament, of, the, bible, in, this, sense, anyone, who, is, within, the, body, of, christ, i, e, a, professing, christian, is, a, saint, because, of, their, relationship, with, christ, jesus, many, protestants, consider, intercessory, prayers, to, the, saints, to, be, idolatry, since, what, they, perceive, to, be, an, application, of, divine, worship, that, should, be, given, only, to, god, himself, is, being, given, to, other, believers, dead, or, alive, within, some, protestant, traditions, saint, is, also, used, to, refer, to, any, born, again, christian, many, emphasize, the, traditional, new, testament, meaning, of, the, word, preferring, to, write, saint, to, refer, to, any, believer, in, continuity, with, the, doctrine, of, the, priesthood, of, all, believers, the, use, of, saint, within, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, is, similar, to, the, protestant, tradition, in, the, new, testament, saints, are, all, those, who, have, entered, into, the, christian, covenant, of, baptism, the, qualification, latter, day, refers, to, the, doctrine, that, members, are, living, in, the, latter, days, before, the, second, coming, of, christ, and, is, used, to, distinguish, the, members, of, the, church, which, considers, itself, the, restoration, of, the, ancient, christian, church, members, are, therefore, often, referred, to, as, latter, day, saints, or, lds, and, among, themselves, as, saints, in, some, theological, literature, the, use, of, the, term, saint, tends, to, be, used, in, non, christian, contexts, as, well, in, many, religions, there, are, people, who, have, been, recognized, within, their, tradition, as, having, fulfilled, the, highest, aspirations, of, religious, teaching, in, english, the, term, saint, is, often, used, to, translate, this, idea, from, many, world, religions, the, jewish, as, d, or, tsaddiq, the, islamic, qidees, the, zoroastrian, fravashi, the, hindu, rsi, or, guru, the, buddhist, arahant, or, bodhisattva, the, daoist, shengren, the, shinto, kami, and, others, have, all, been, referred, to, as, saints, cuban, santer, a, haitian, vodou, trinidad, orisha, shango, brazilian, umbanda, candombl, and, other, similar, syncretist, religions, adopted, the, catholic, saints, or, at, least, the, images, of, the, saints, and, applied, their, own, spirits, deities, to, them, they, are, worshipped, in, churches, where, they, appear, as, saints, and, in, religious, festivals, where, they, appear, as, the, deities, the, name, santer, a, was, originally, a, pejorative, term, for, those, whose, worship, of, saints, deviated, from, catholic, norms, buddhists, in, both, the, theravada, and, mahayana, traditions, hold, the, arhats, in, special, esteem, as, well, as, highly, developed, bodhisattvas, tibetan, buddhists, hold, the, tulkus, reincarnates, of, deceased, eminent, practitioners, as, living, saints, on, earth, due, to, the, christian, influence, on, druze, faith, two, christian, saints, become, the, druze, s, favorite, venerated, figures, saint, george, and, saint, elijah, thus, in, all, the, villages, inhabited, by, druzes, and, christians, in, central, mount, lebanon, a, christian, church, or, druze, maqam, is, dedicated, to, either, one, of, them, according, to, scholar, ray, jabre, mouawad, the, druzes, appreciated, the, two, saints, for, their, bravery, saint, george, because, he, confronted, the, dragon, and, saint, elijah, because, he, competed, with, the, pagan, priests, of, baal, and, won, over, them, in, both, cases, the, explanations, provided, by, christians, is, that, druzes, were, attracted, to, warrior, saints, that, resemble, their, own, militarized, society, hindu, saints, are, those, recognized, by, hindus, as, showing, a, great, degree, of, holiness, and, sanctity, hinduism, has, a, long, tradition, of, stories, and, poetry, about, saints, there, is, no, formal, canonization, process, in, hinduism, but, over, time, many, men, and, women, have, reached, the, status, of, saints, among, their, followers, and, among, hindus, in, general, unlike, in, christianity, hinduism, does, not, canonize, people, as, saints, after, death, but, they, can, be, accepted, as, saints, during, their, lifetime, hindu, saints, have, often, renounced, the, world, and, are, variously, called, gurus, sadhus, rishis, devarishis, rajarshis, saptarishis, brahmarshis, swamis, pundits, purohits, pujaris, acharyas, pravaras, yogis, yoginis, and, other, names, some, hindu, saints, are, given, god, like, status, being, seen, as, incarnations, of, vishnu, shiva, devi, and, other, aspects, of, the, divine, this, can, happen, during, their, lifetimes, or, sometimes, many, years, after, their, deaths, this, explains, another, common, name, for, hindu, saints, godmen, besides, prophets, according, to, islam, saints, possess, blessings, arabic, baraka, and, can, perform,

visited, frequently, ziyarat, people, would, seek, the, advice, of, a, saint, in, their, quest, for, spiritual, fulfilment, unlike, saints, in, christianity, muslim, saints, are, usually, acknowledged, informally, by, consensus, of, common, people, not, by, scholars, unlike, prophets, women, like, rabia, of, basra, were, accepted, as, saints, saints, are, recognized, as, having,

body, appearing, in, the, dreams, of, others, who, they, pray, on, behalf, of, appearing, in, two, places, at, once, and, having, normally, impossible, knowledge, islam, has, had, a, rich, history, of, veneration, of, saints, often, called, wali, which, literally, means, friend, which, has, declined, in, some, parts, of, the, islamic, world, in, the, twentieth, century, due, to, the, influence, of, the, various, streams, of, salafism, in, sunni, islam, the, veneration, of, saints, became, a, very, common, form, of, devotion, early, on, and, saints, came, to, be, defined, in, the, eighth, century, as, a, group, of, special, people, chosen, by, god, and, endowed, with, exceptional, gifts, such, as, the, ability, to, work, miracles, the, classical, sunni, scholars, came, to, recognize,

awliy, requirement, in, sunni, islam, with, even, medieval, critics, of, the, ubiquitous, practice, of, grave, visitation, like, ibn, taymiyyah, emphatically, declaring, the, miracles, of, saints, are, absolutely, true, and, correct, and, acknowledged, by, all, muslim, scholars, the, quran, has, pointed, to, it, in, different, places, and, the, sayings, of, the, prophet, have, mentioned, it, and, whoever, denies, the, miraculous, power, of, saints, are, innovators, or, following, innovators, the, vast, majority, of, saints, venerated, in, the, classical, sunni, world, were, the, sufis, who, were, all, sunni, mystics, who, belonged, to, one, of, the, four, orthodox, legal, schools, of, sunni, law, veneration, of, saints, eventually, became, one, of, the, most, widespread, sunni, practices, for, more, than, a, millennium, before, it, was, opposed, in, the, twentieth, century, by, the, salafi, movement, whose, various, streams, regard, it, as, being, both, un, islamic, and, backwards, rather, than, the, integral, part, of, islam, which, they, were, for, over, a, millennium, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, protestant, reformation, the, specific, traditional, practices, which, salafism, has, tried, to, curtail, in, both, sunni, and, shia, contexts, include, those, of, the, veneration, of, saints, visiting, their, graves, seeking, their, intercession, and, honoring, their, relics, as, christopher, taylor, has, remarked, a, vital, dimension, of, islamic, piety, was, the, veneration, of, muslim, saints, certain, strains, of, thought, within, the, islamic, tradition, itself, particularly, pronounced, in, the, nineteenth, and, the, twentieth, centuries, muslims, have, either, resisted, acknowledging, the, existence, of, muslim, saints, altogether, or, have, viewed, their, presence, and, veneration, as, unacceptable, deviations, the, term, tzadik, righteous, and, its, associated, meanings, developed, in, rabbinic, thought, from, its, talmudic,

local, muslim, practices, however, the, ideas, and, rituals, in, this, specific, context, are, still, thoroughly, situated, within, judaism, the, bodies, of, the, saintly, dead, are, treated, like, torah, scrolls, with, their, shrines, being, their, ark, and, pilgrimages, taking, on, the, ritual, trappings, of, a, torah, service, icons, of, saints, also, are, paralleled, to, torah, scrolls,
