suggested, that, poseidon, was, probably, a, pelasgian, god, or, a, god, of, the, minyans, however, it, is, possible, that, poseidon, like, zeus, was, a, common, god, of, all, greeks, from, the,

hellenic, cult, of, poseidon, as, a, horse, god, may, be, connected, to, the, introduction, of, the, horse, and, war, chariot, from, anatolia, to, greece, around, 1600, bc, in, the, boeotian, myth, poseidon, is, the, water, god, and, erinys, is, a, goddess, of, the, underworld, she, is, probably, the, personification, of, a, revenging, earth, spirit, and, it, seems, that, she, had, a, similar,

called, despoina, mistress, which, is, another, name, of, persephone, the, theriomorphic, form, of, gods, seems, to, be, local, in, arcadia, in, an, old, religion, associated, with, xoana, according, to, some, theories, poseidon, was, a, pelasgian, god, or, a, god, of, the, minyans, traditionally, the, minyans, are, considered, pelasgians, and, they, lived, in, thessaly, and, boeotia, in, thessaly, pelasgiotis, there, was, a, close, relation, to, the, horses, poseidon, created, the, first, horse, skyphios, hitting, a, rock, with, his, trident, and, managed, in, the, same, way, to, drain, the, valley, of, tempe, the, thessalians, were, famous, charioteers, some, of, the, oldest, greek, myths, appear, in, boeotia, in, ancient, cults, poseidon, was, worshipped, as, a, horse, the, mythical, horse, arion, was, a, sire, of, poseidon, horse, with, erinys, and, the, winged, horse, pegasus, a, sire, of, poseidon, foaled, by, medousa, at, onchestos, he, had, an, old, famous, festival, which, included, horseracing, however, it, is, possible, that, poseidon, like, zeus, was, a, common, god, of, all, greeks, from, the, beginning, it, is, possible, that, the, greeks, did, not, bring, with, them, other, gods, except, zeus, eos, and, the, dioskouroi, the, pelasgian, god, probably, represented, the, fertilising, power, of, water, and, then, he, was, he, was, considered, god, of, the, sea, as, the, sea, encircles, and, holds, the, earth, in, its, position, poseidon, is, the, god, who, holds, the, earth, and, who, has, the, ability, to, shake, the, earth, the, primeval, water, who, encircled, the, earth, oceanus, is, the, origin, of, all, rivers, and, springs, they, are, children, of, oceanus, and, tethys, farnell, suggested, that, poseidon, was, originally, the, god, of, the, minyans, who, occupied, thessaly, and, boeotia, there, is, a, similarity, between, the, boeotian, and, arcadian, myths, and, especially, between, the, myths, which, represent, the, god, of, the, waters, poseidon, as, a, horse, the, mythical, horse, arion, appears, in, both, regions, the, offspring, of, poseidon, winged, horse, pegasus, creates, famous, springs, near, helikon, and, at, troizen, some, springs, of, poseidon, have, similar, names, in, boeotia, and, peloponnese, it, is, possible, that, the, name, of, poseidon, helikonios, in, boeotia, whose, fest, included, horseracing, derives, from, the, mountain, helikon, the, minyans, had, trade, contacts, with, mycenean, pylos, and, the, achaeans, adopted, the, cult, of, poseidon, helikonios, the, cult, spread, in, peloponnese, and, then, to, ionia, when, the, achaeans, migrated, to, asia, minor, nilsson, suggested, that, poseidon, was, probably, a, common, god, of, all, greeks, from, the, beginning, the, greeks, occupied, thessaly, boeotia, and, peloponnese, during, the, bronze, age, in, all, these, regions, poseidon, was, the, god, of, the, horses, the, origin, of, his, cult, was, peloponnese, and, he, was, the, inland, god, of, the, achaeans, the, god, of, the, horses, and, the, earthquakes, when, the, achaeans, migrated, to, ionia, there, was, a, transition, to, regarding, poseidon, as, the, god, of, the, sea, because, the, ionians, were, sea, dependent, with, no, doubt, he, was, originally, the, god, of, the, waters, the, greeks, believed, that, the, cause, of, the, earthquakes, was, the, erosion, of, the, rocks, by, the, waters, by, the, rivers, in, peloponnese, which, they, saw, to, disappear, into, the, earth, and, then, to, burst, out, again, the, god, of, the, waters, became, the, earth, shaker, this, is, what, the, natural, philosophers, thales, anaximenes, and, aristotle, believed, and, could, not, be, different, from, the, folk, belief, in, the, greek, legends, arethusa, and, the, river, alpheus, traversed, underground, under, the, sea, and, reappeared, at, ortygia, in, any, case, the, early, importance, of, poseidon, can, still, be, glimpsed, in, homer, s, odyssey, where, poseidon, rather, than, zeus, is, the, major, mover, of, events, in, homer, poseidon, is, the, master, of, the, sea, he, is, described, as, a, majestic, scary, and, avenging, monarch, of, the, sea, the, worship, of, poseidon, was, extended, all, over, greece, and, southern, italy, but, he, was, specially, honoured, in, peloponnese, which, is, called, the, residence, of, poseidon, and, in, the, ionic, cities, the, significance, of, his, cult, is, indicated, by, the, names, of, cities, like, poteidaia, in, the, chalkidiki, peninsula, and, poseidonia, paestum, a, greek, colony, in, italy, poseidion, is, a, frequent, greek, placename, along, coastlines, and, the, name, of, a, greek, colony, at, the, syrian, coast, in, ionia, his, cult, was, introduced, by, achaean, colonists, from, greece, in, the, 11th, century, bc, traditionally, the, colonists, came, from, pylos, where, poseidon, was, the, principal, god, of, the, city, the, god, had, a, famous, temple, near, the, mountain, mycale, the, month, poseidaon, is, the, month, of, the, winter, storms, the, name, of, the, month, was, used, in, ionic, territories, in, athens, in, the,

of, the, athletic, games, in, honour, of, the, god, poseidon, was, considered, a, symbol, of, unity, the, panionia, the, festival, of, all, ionians, near, mycale, were, celebrated, in, honour, of,

constructed, in, early, 7th, century, bc, c, 690, 650, bc, at, isthmia, near, corinth, which, was, later, dedicated, to, poseidon, is, considered, a, pioneering, building, featuring, doric, architecture, it, seems, that, the, first, temple, with, pure, doric, elements, was, built, with, the, aid, of, corinthians, at, thermon, in, aetolia, in, the, middle, of, 7th, century, bc, century, c, 640, 630, bc, it, was, a, peripteral, narrow, wooden, structure, dedicated, to, apollo, it, measured, 12, 13, x38, 23, m, at, the, stylobate, and, the, number, of, pteron, columns, was, 5x15, in, the, earlier, temples, the, peripteral, colonnade, is, treated, with, a, freedom, unknown, to, later, doric, architects, this, is, in, part, an, especially, western, feature, in, italy, because, the, hexastyle, sceme, was, adopted, as, in, the, temple, of, poseidon, at, taranto, and, the, second, temple, of, hera, at, paestum, traditionally, named, temple, of, poseidon, in, the, earlier, temples, where, the, number, of, the, columns, in, the, porch, is, odd, so, are, the, columns, of, the, pteron, facade, in, such, temples, the, side, ptera, are, approximately, the, width, of, one, or, two, intercolumniations, in, the, hexastyle, scheme, like, the, temple, of, poseidon, at, sounion, there, are, normally, two, or, four, columns, in, the, porch, and, the, side, ptera, are, approximately, the, width, of, one, intercolumniation, in, doric, early, work, the, distance, between, column, and, column, differs, on, the, fronts, and, on, the, flanks, and, this, can, be, observed, in, the, temple, of, poseidon, at, kalaureia, and, in, basilica, at, paestum, after, the, 6th, century, the, rule, in, doric, is, an, approximate, equality, of, intercolumniations, and, it, can, be, observed, in, the, temple, of, poseidon, at, sounion, where, there, is, a, slight, difference, in, the, standard, version, poseidon, was, born, to, the, titans, cronus, and, rhea, the, fifth, child, out, of, six, born, after, hestia, demeter, hera, and, hades, in, that, order, because, poseidon, s, father, was, afraid, that, one, of, his, children, would, overthrow, him, like, he, had, done, to, his, own, father, cronus, devoured, each, infant, as, soon, as, they, were, born, poseidon, was, the, last, one, to, suffer, this, fate, before, rhea, decided, to, deceive, cronus, and, whisk, the, sixth, child, zeus, away, to, safety, after, offering, cronus, a, rock, wrapped, in, a, blanket, to, eat, once, zeus, was, grown, he, gave, his, father, a, powerful, emetic, that, made, him, gorge, up, the, children, he, had, eaten, the, five, children, emerged, from, their, father, s, belly, in, reverse, order, making, poseidon, both, the, second, youngest, child, and, the, second, oldest, at, the, same, time, armed, with, a, trident, forged, for, him, by, the, cyclopes, poseidon, with, his, siblings, and, other, divine, allies, defeated, the, titans, and, became, rulers, in, their, place, according, to, homer, and, apollodorus, zeus, poseidon, and, the, third, brother, hades, then, divided, the, world, between, them, by, drawing, lots, zeus, got, the, sky, poseidon, the, sea, and, hades, the, underworld, in, a, rarer, and, later, version, poseidon, avoided, being, devoured, by, his, father, as, his, mother, rhea, saved, him, in, the, same, manner, she, did, zeus, by, offering, cronus, a, foal, instead, claiming, she, had, given, birth, to, a, horse, instead, of, a, god, while, she, had, actually, laid, the, child, in, a, flock, rhea, entrusted, her, infant, to, a, spring, nymph, when, cronus, demanded, the, child, the, nymph, arne, denied, having, him, and, her, spring, thereafter, was, called, arne, which, bears, resemblance, to, the, greek, word, for, deny, in, another, tale, rhea, gave, poseidon, to, the, telchines, ancient, inhabitants, of, the, island, of, rhodes, capheira, an, oceanid, nymph, became, the, young, god, s, nurse, as, poseidon, grew, he, fell, in, love, with, halia, the, beautiful, sister, of, the, telchines, and, fathered, six, sons, and, one, daughter, rhodos, on, her, by, that, time, aphrodite, the, goddess, of, love, had, been, born, and, risen, from, the, sea, and, attempted, to, make, a, stop, at, rhodes, on, her, way, to, cyprus, poseidon, and, halia, s, sons, denied, her, hospitality, so, aphrodite, cursed, them, to, fall, in, love, and, rape, halia, after, they, had, done, so, poseidon, made, them, sink, below, the, sea, in, homer, s, odyssey, poseidon, has, a, home, in, aegae, athena, became, the, patron, goddess, of, the, city, of, athens, after, a, competition, with, poseidon, yet, poseidon, remained, a, numinous, presence, on, the, acropolis, in, the, form, of, his, surrogate, erechtheus, at, the, dissolution, festival, at, the, end, of, the, year, in, the, athenian, calendar, the, skira, the, priests, of, athena, and, the, priest, of, poseidon, would, process, under, canopies, to, eleusis, they, agreed, that, each, would, give, the, athenians, one, gift, and, the, athenians, would, choose, whichever, gift, they, preferred, poseidon, struck, the, ground, with, his, trident, and, a, spring, sprang, up, the, water, was, salty, and, not, very, useful, whereas, athena, offered, them, an, olive, tree, the, athenians, or, their, king, cecrops, accepted, the, olive, tree, and, along, with, it, athena, as, their, patron, for, the, olive, tree, brought, wood, oil, and, food, after, the, fight, infuriated, at, his, loss, poseidon, sent, a, monstrous, flood, to, the, attic, plain, to, punish, the, athenians, for, not, choosing, him, the, depression, made, by, poseidon, s, trident, and, filled, with, salt, water, was, surrounded, by, the, northern, hall, of, the, erechtheum, remaining, open, to, the, air, burkert, noted, in, cult, poseidon, was, identified, with, erechtheus, and, the, myth, turns, this, into, a, temporal, causal, sequence, in, his, anger, at, losing, poseidon, led, his, son, eumolpus, against, athens, and, killed, erectheus, it, was, also, said, that, poseidon, in, his, anger, over, his, defeat, sent, one, of, his, sons, halirrhothius, to, cut, down, athena, s, tree, gift, but, as, halirrhothius, swung, his, axe, he, missed, his, aim, and, it, fell, in, himself, killing, him, instantly, poseidon, in, fury, accused, ares, of, murder, and, the, matter, was, eventually, settled, on, the, areopagus, hill, of, ares, in, favour, of, ares, which, was, thereafter, named, after, the, event, in, other, versions, halirrhothius, raped, alcippe, ares, s, daughter, so, ares, slew, him, poseidon, was, enraged, over, the, murder, of, his, son, and, ares, was, thus, held, in, hold, which, eventually, acquitted, him, the, contest, of, athena, and, poseidon, was, the, subject, of, the, reliefs, on, the, western, pediment, of, the, parthenon, the, first, sight, that, greeted, the, arriving, visitor, this, myth, is, construed, by, robert, graves, and, others, as, reflecting, a, clash, between, the, inhabitants, during, mycenaean, times, and, newer, immigrants, athens, at, its, height, was, a, significant, sea, power, at, one, point, defeating, the, persian, fleet, at, salamis, island, in, a, sea, battle, the, corinthians, had, a, similar, story, to, the, foundations, of, athens, about, their, own, city, corinth, according, to, the, myth, helios, and, poseidon, clashed, both, desiring, to, make, the, city, their, own, their, dispute, was, brought, to, one, of, the, hecatoncheires, briareos, an, elder, god, who, was, thus, tasked, to, settle, the, fight, between, the, two, gods, briareus, decided, to, award, the, acrocorinth, to, helios, while, to, poseidon, he, gave, the, isthmus, of, corinth, in, this, tale, helios, and, poseidon, are, supposed, to, represent, fire, versus, water, helios, as, the, sun, god, received, the, area, that, is, closest, to, the, sky, while, poseidon, who, is, the, sea, god, got, the, isthmus, by, the, sea, at, another, time, poseidon, came, to, an, agreement, with, another, goddess, leto, that, he, would, give, her, the, island, of, delos, in, exchange, for, the, island, of, calauria, he, also, exchanged, delphi, for, taenarum, with, apollo, a, temple, of, poseidon, stood, at, calauria, during, ancient, times, poseidon, also, came, to, dispute, with, his, sister, hera, over, the, city, of, argos, a, local, king, was, chosen, to, settle, the, matter, phoroneus, and, he, decided, to, award, the, city, to, hera, who, then, became, its, patroness, poseidon, was, enraged, and, sent, a, drought, to, plague, the, city, one, day, as, an, argive, woman, named, amymone, went, out, in, search, of, water, came, upon, a, satyr, who, tried, to, rape, her, amymone, prayed, to, poseidon, for, help, and, he, scared, the, satyr, away, with, his, trident, after, poseidon, rescued, amymone, from, the, lecherous, satyr, he, fathered, a, child, on, her, nauplius, poseidon, and, apollo, having, offended, zeus, by, their, rebellion, in, hera, s, scheme, were, temporarily, stripped, of, their, divine, authority, and, sent, to, serve, king, laomedon, of, troy, he, had, them, build, huge, walls, around, the, city, and, promised, to, reward, them, with, his, immortal, horses, a, promise, he, then, refused, to, fulfill, in, vengeance, before, the, trojan, war, poseidon, sent, a, sea, monster, to, attack, troy, the, monster, was, later, killed, by, heracles, poseidon, fathered, the, hero, theseus, with, the, troezenian, princess, aethra, theseus, was, also, said, to, be, the, son, of, aegeus, the, king, of, athens, who, slept, with, aethra, on, the, very, same, night, thus, theseus, s, origins, included, both, the, human, and, the, divine, element, meanwhile, in, crete, zeus, s, son, minos, asked, for, poseidon, s, help, in, order, to, certify, his, claim, on, the, throne, of, crete, poseidon, offered, minos, a, splendid, white, bull, with, the, understanding, that, he, was, to, sacrifice, the, bull, to, poseidon, later, the, cretans, were, so, impressed, with, the, bull, and, the, divine, sign, itself, that, minos, was, declared, king, of, crete, but, wishing, to, keep, the, beautiful, animal, for, himself, minos, instead, sacrificed, an, ordinary, bull, to, the, sea, god, instead, of, the, agreed, upon, one, poseidon, enraged, caused, minos, s, wife, pasiphae, to, fall, in, love, with, the, bull, their, coupling, produced, the, minotaur, a, half, bull, half, human, creature, who, fed, on, human, flesh, minos, concealed, him,

who, had, been, chosen, to, be, devoured, by, the, minotaur, once, he, arrived, in, crete, minos, insulted, theseus, and, insisted, he, was, no, son, of, poseidon, to, demonstrate, so, he, threw, his, own, ring, in, to, the, sea, and, commanded, theseus, to, retrieve, it, expecting, he, would, not, be, able, to, do, so, theseus, immediately, dove, in, after, it, dolphins, then, came, as, guides, and, escorted, him, to, the, halls, of, poseidon, and, amphitrite, s, palace, where, he, was, warmly, welcomed, he, received, the, ring, and, in, addition, a, purple, wedding, cloak, and, a, crown,
