reason, is, the, capacity, of, consciously, applying, logic, by, drawing, valid, conclusions, from, new, or, existing, information, with, the, aim, of, seeking, the, truth, it, is, associated, with, such, characteristically, human, activities, as, philosophy, religion, science, language, mathematics, and, art, and, is, normally, considered, to, be, a, distinguishing, ability, possessed, by, humans, reason, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, rationality, reasoning, involves, using, more, or, less, rational, processes, of, thinking, and, cognition, to, extrapolate, from, one, s, existing, knowledge, to, generate, new, knowledge, and, involves, the, use, of, one, s, intellect, the, field, of, logic, studies, the, ways, in, which, humans, can, use, formal, reasoning, to, produce, logically, valid, arguments, and, true, conclusions, reasoning, may, be, subdivided, into, forms, of, logical, reasoning, such, as, deductive, reasoning, inductive, reasoning, and, abductive, reasoning, aristotle, drew, a, distinction, between, logical, discursive, reasoning, reason, proper, and, intuitive, reasoning, vi, 7, in, which, the, reasoning, process, through, intuition, however, valid, may, tend, toward, the, personal, and, the, subjectively, opaque, in, some, social, and, political, settings, logical, and, intuitive, modes, of, reasoning, may, clash, while, in, other, contexts, intuition, and, formal, reason, are, seen, as, complementary, rather, than, adversarial, for, example, in, mathematics, intuition, is, often, necessary, for, the, creative, processes, involved, with, arriving, at, a, formal, proof, arguably, the, most, difficult, of, formal, reasoning, tasks, reasoning, like, habit, or, intuition, is, one, of, the, ways, by, which, thinking, moves, from, one, idea, to, a, related, idea, for, example, reasoning, is, the, means, by, which, rational, individuals, understand, the, significance, of, sensory, information, from, their, environments, or, conceptualize, abstract, dichotomies, such, as, cause, and, effect, truth, and, falsehood, or, good, and, evil, reasoning, as, a, part, of, executive, decision, making, is, also, closely, identified, with, the, ability, to, self, consciously, change, in, terms, of, goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and, institutions, and, therefore, with, the, capacity, for, freedom, and, self, determination, in, contrast, to, the, use, of, reason, as, an, abstract, noun, a, reason, is, a, consideration, that, either, explains, or, justifies, events, phenomena, or, behavior, reasons, justify, decisions, reasons, support, explanations, of, natural, phenomena, and, reasons, can, be, given, to, explain, the, actions, conduct, of, individuals, the, words, are, connected, in, this, way, using, reason, or, reasoning, means, providing, good, reasons, for, example, when, evaluating, a, moral, decision, morality, is, at, the, very, least, the, effort, to, guide, one, s, conduct, by, reason, that, is, doing, what, there, are, the, best, reasons, for, doing, while, giving, equal, weight, to, the, interests, of, all, those, affected, by, what, one, does, psychologists, and, cognitive, scientists, have, attempted, to, study, and, explain, how, people, reason, e, g, which, cognitive, and, neural, processes, are, engaged, and, how, cultural, factors, affect, the, inferences, that, people, draw, the, field, of, automated, reasoning, studies, how, reasoning, may, or, may, not, be, modeled, computationally, animal, psychology, considers, the, question, of, whether, animals, other, than, humans, can, reason, in, the, english, language, and, other, modern, european, languages, reason, and, related, words, represent, words, which, have, always, been, used, to, translate, latin, and, classical, greek, terms, in, their, philosophical, sense, the, earliest, major, philosophers, to, publish, in, english, such, as, francis, bacon, thomas, hobbes, and, john, locke, also, routinely, wrote, in, latin, and, french, and, compared, their, terms, to, greek, treating, the, words, logos, ratio, raison, and, reason, as, interchangeable, the, meaning, of, the, word, reason, in, senses, such, as, human, reason, also, overlaps, to, a, large, extent, with, rationality, and, the, adjective, of, reason, in, philosophical, contexts, is, normally, rational, rather, than, reasoned, or, reasonable, some, philosophers, thomas, hobbes, for, example, also, used, the, word, ratiocination, as, a, synonym, for, reasoning, the, proposal, that, reason, gives, humanity, a, special, position, in, nature, has, been, argued, to, be, a, defining, characteristic, of, western, philosophy, and, later, western, science, starting, with, classical, greece, philosophy, can, be, described, as, a, way, of, life, based, upon, reason, while, reason, has, been, among, the, major, subjects, of, philosophical, discussion, since, ancient, times, reason, is, often, said, to, be, reflexive, or, self, correcting, and, the, critique, of, reason, has, been, a, persistent, theme, in, philosophy, for, many, classical, philosophers, nature, was, understood, teleologically, meaning, that, every, type, of, thing, had, a, definitive, purpose, that, fit, within, a, natural, order, that, was, itself, understood, to, have, aims, perhaps, starting, with, pythagoras, or, heraclitus, the, cosmos, was, even, said, to, have, reason, reason, by, this, account, is, not, just, a, characteristic, that, people, happen, to, have, reason, was, considered, of, higher, stature, than, other, characteristics, of, human, nature, because, it, is, something, people, share, with, nature, itself, linking, an, apparently, immortal, part, of, the, human, mind, with, the, divine, order, of, the, cosmos, within, the, human, mind, or, soul, psyche, reason, was, described, by, plato, as, being, the, natural, monarch, which, should, rule, over, the, other, parts, such, as, spiritedness, thumos, and, the, passions, aristotle, plato, s, student, defined, human, beings, as, rational, animals, emphasizing, reason, as, a, characteristic, of, human, nature, he, described, the, highest, human, happiness, or, well, being, eudaimonia, as, a, life, which, is, lived, consistently, excellently, and, completely, in, accordance, with, reason, i, the, conclusions, to, be, drawn, from, the, discussions, of, aristotle, and, plato, on, this, matter, are, amongst, the, most, debated, in, the, history, of, philosophy, but, teleological, accounts, such, as, aristotle, s, were, highly, influential, for, those, who, attempt, to, explain, reason, in, a, way, that, is, consistent, with, monotheism, and, the, immortality, and, divinity, of, the, human, soul, for, example, in, the, neoplatonist, account, of, plotinus, the, cosmos, has, one, soul, which, is, the, seat, of, all, reason, and, the, souls, of, all, people, are, part, of, this, soul, reason, is, for, plotinus, both, the, provider, of, form, to, material, things, and, the, light, which, brings, people, s, souls, back, into, line, with, their, source, the, classical, view, of, reason, like, many, important, neoplatonic, and, stoic, ideas, was, readily, adopted, by, the, early, church, as, the, church, fathers, saw, greek, philosophy, as, an, indispensable, instrument, given, to, mankind, so, that, we, may, understand, revelation, for, example, the, greatest, among, the, early, church, fathers, and, doctors, of, the, church, such, as, augustine, of, hippo, basil, of, caesarea, and, gregory, of, nyssa, were, as, much, neoplatonic, philosophers, as, they, were, christian, theologians, and, they, adopted, the, neoplatonic, view, of, human, reason, and, its, implications, for, our, relationship, to, creation, to, ourselves, and, to, god, the, neoplatonic, conception, of, the, rational, aspect, of, the, human, soul, was, widely, adopted, by, medieval, islamic, philosophers, and, continues, to, hold, significance, in, iranian, philosophy, as, european, intellectual, life, reemerged, from, the, dark, ages, the, christian, patristic, tradition, and, the, influence, of, esteemed, islamic, scholars, like, averroes, and, avicenna, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, scholastic, view, of, reason, which, laid, the, foundation, for, our, modern, understanding, of, this, concept, among, the, scholastics, who, relied, on, the, classical, concept, of, reason, for, the, development, of, their, doctrines, none, were, more, influential, than, saint, thomas, aquinas, who, put, this, concept, at, the, heart, of, his, natural, law, in, this, doctrine, thomas, concludes, that, because, humans, have, reason, and, because, reason, is, a, spark, of, the, divine, every, single, human, life, is, invaluable, all, humans, are, equal, and, every, human, is, born, with, an, intrinsic, and, permanent, set, of, basic, rights, on, this, foundation, the, idea, of, human, rights, would, later, be, constructed, by, spanish, theologians, at, the, school, of, salamanca, other, scholastics, such, as, roger, bacon, and, albertus, magnus, following, the, example, of, islamic, scholars, such, as, alhazen, emphasised, reason, an, intrinsic, human, ability, to, decode, the, created, order, and, the, structures, that, underlie, our, experienced, physical, reality, this, interpretation, of, reason, was, instrumental, to, the, development, of, the, scientific, method, in, the, early, universities, of, the, high, middle, ages, the, early, modern, era, was, marked, by, a, number, of, significant, changes, in, the, understanding, of, reason, starting, in, europe, one, of, the, most, important, of, these, changes, involved, a, change, in, the, metaphysical, understanding, of, human, beings, scientists, and, philosophers, began, to, question, the, teleological, understanding, of, the, world, nature, was, no, longer, assumed, to, be, human, like, with, its, own, aims, or, reason, and, human, nature, was, no, longer, assumed, to, work, according, to, anything, other, than, the, same, laws, of, nature, which, affect, inanimate, things, this, new, understanding, eventually, displaced, the, previous, world, view, that, derived, from, a, spiritual, understanding, of, the, universe, accordingly, in, the, 17th, century, ren, descartes, explicitly, rejected, the, traditional, notion, of, humans, as, rational, animals, suggesting, instead, that, they, are, nothing, more, than, thinking, things, along, the, lines, of, other, things, in, nature, any, grounds, of, knowledge, outside, that, understanding, was, therefore, subject, to, doubt, in, his, search, for, a, foundation, of, all, possible, knowledge, descartes, decided, to, throw, into, doubt, all, knowledge, except, that, of, the, mind, itself, in, the, process, of, thinking, at, this, time, i, admit, nothing, that, is, not, necessarily, true, i, am, therefore, precisely, nothing, but, a, thinking, thing, that, is, a, mind, or, intellect, or, understanding, or, reason, words, of, whose, meanings, i, was, previously, ignorant, this, eventually, became, known, as, epistemological, or, subject, centred, reason, because, it, is, based, on, the, knowing, subject, who, perceives, the, rest, of, the, world, and, itself, as, a, set, of, objects, to, be, studied, and, successfully, mastered, by, applying, the, knowledge, accumulated, through, such, study, breaking, with, tradition, and, with, many, thinkers, after, him, descartes, explicitly, did, not, divide, the, incorporeal, soul, into, parts, such, as, reason, and, intellect, describing, them, instead, as, one, indivisible, incorporeal, entity, a, contemporary, of, descartes, thomas, hobbes, described, reason, as, a, broader, version, of, addition, and, subtraction, which, is, not, limited, to, numbers, this, understanding, of, reason, is, sometimes, termed, calculative, reason, similar, to, descartes, hobbes, asserted, that, no, discourse, whatsoever, can, end, in, absolute, knowledge, of, fact, past, or, to, come, but, that, sense, and, memory, is, absolute, knowledge, in, the, late, 17th, century, through, the, 18th, century, john, locke, and, david, hume, developed, descartes, s, line, of, thought, still, further, hume, took, it, in, an, especially, skeptical, direction, proposing, that, there, could, be, no, possibility, of, deducing, relationships, of, cause, and, effect, and, therefore, no, knowledge, is, based, on, reasoning, alone, even, if, it, seems, otherwise, hume, famously, remarked, that, we, speak, not, strictly, and, philosophically, when, we, talk, of, the, combat, of, passion, and, of, reason, reason, is, and, ought, only, to, be, the, slave, of, the, passions, and, can, never, pretend, to, any, other, office, than, to, serve, and, obey, them, hume, also, took, his, definition, of, reason, to, unorthodox, extremes, by, arguing, unlike, his, predecessors, that, human, reason, is, not, qualitatively, different, from, either, simply, conceiving, individual, ideas, or, from, judgments, associating, two, ideas, and, that, reason, is, nothing, but, a, wonderful, and, unintelligible, instinct, in, our, souls, which, carries, us, along, a, certain, train, of, ideas, and, endows, them, with, particular, qualities, according, to, their, particular, situations, and, relations, it, followed, from, this, that, animals, have, reason, only, much, less, complex, than, human, reason, in, the, 18th, century, immanuel, kant, attempted, to, show, that, hume, was, wrong, by, demonstrating, that, a, transcendental, self, or, i, was, a, necessary, condition, of, all, experience, therefore, suggested, kant, on, the, basis, of, such, a, self, it, is, in, fact, possible, to, reason, both, about, the, conditions, and, limits, of, human, knowledge, and, so, long, as, these, limits, are, respected, reason, can, be, the, vehicle, of, morality, justice, aesthetics, theories, of, knowledge, epistemology, and, understanding, in, the, formulation, of, kant, who, wrote, some, of, the, most, influential, modern, treatises, on, the, subject, the, great, achievement, of, reason, german, vernunft, is, that, it, is, able, to, exercise, a, kind, of, universal, law, making, kant, was, able, therefore, to, reformulate, the, basis, of, moral, practical, theoretical, and, aesthetic, reasoning, on, universal, laws, here, practical, reasoning, is, the, self, legislating, or, self, governing, formulation, of, universal, norms, and, theoretical, reasoning, is, the, way, humans, posit, universal, laws, of, nature, under, practical, reason, the, moral, autonomy, or, freedom, of, people, depends, on, their, ability, by, the, proper, exercise, of, that, reason, to, behave, according, to, laws, that, are, given, to, them, this, contrasted, with, earlier, forms, of, morality, which, depended, on, religious, understanding, and, interpretation, or, on, nature, for, their, substance, according, to, kant, in, a, free, society, each, individual, must, be, able, to, pursue, their, goals, however, they, see, fit, as, long, as, their, actions, conform, to, principles, given, by, reason, he, formulated, such, a, principle, called, the, categorical, imperative, which, would, justify, an, action, only, if, it, could, be, universalized, act, only, according, to, that, maxim, whereby, you, can, at, the, same, time, will, that, it, should, become, a, universal, law, in, contrast, to, hume, kant, insisted, that, reason, itself, german, vernunft, could, be, used, to, find, solutions, to, metaphysical, problems, especially, the, discovery, of, the, foundations, of, morality, kant, claimed, that, these, solutions, could, be, found, with, his, transcendental, logic, which, unlike, normal, logic, is, not, just, an, instrument, that, can, be, used, indifferently, as, it, was, for, aristotle, but, a, theoretical, science, in, its, own, right, and, the, basis, of, all, the, others, according, to, j, rgen, habermas, the, substantive, unity, of, reason, has, dissolved, in, modern, times, such, that, it, can, no, longer, answer, the, question, how, should, i, live, instead, the, unity, of, reason, has, to, be, strictly, formal, or, procedural, he, thus, described, reason, as, a, group, of, three, autonomous, spheres, on, the, model, of, kant, s, three, critiques, for, habermas, these, three, spheres, are, the, domain, of, experts, and, therefore, need, to, be, mediated, with, the, lifeworld, by, philosophers, in, drawing, such, a, picture, of, reason, habermas, hoped, to, demonstrate, that, the, substantive, unity, of, reason, which, in, pre, modern, societies, had, been, able, to, answer, questions, about, the, good, life, could, be, made, up, for, by, the, unity, of, reason, s, formalizable, procedures, hamann, herder, kant, hegel, kierkegaard, nietzsche, heidegger, foucault, rorty, and, many, other, philosophers, have, contributed, to, a, debate, about, what, reason, means, or, ought, to, mean, some, like, kierkegaard, nietzsche, and, rorty, are, skeptical, about, subject, centred, universal, or, instrumental, reason, and, even, skeptical, toward, reason, as, a, whole, others, including, hegel, believe, that, it, has, obscured, the, importance, of, intersubjectivity, or, spirit, in, human, life, and, they, attempt, to, reconstruct, a, model, of, what, reason, should, be, some, thinkers, e, g, foucault, believe, there, are, other, forms, of, reason, neglected, but, essential, to, modern, life, and, to, our, understanding, of, what, it, means, to, live, a, life, according, to, reason, others, suggest, that, there, is, not, just, one, reason, or, rationality, but, multiple, possible, systems, of, reason, or, rationality, which, may, conflict, in, which, case, there, is, no, super, rational, system, one, can, appeal, to, in, order, to, resolve, the, conflict, in, the, last, several, decades, a, number, of, proposals, have, been, made, to, re, orient, this, critique, of, reason, or, to, recognize, the, other, voices, or, new, departments, of, reason, for, example, in, opposition, to, subject, centred, reason, habermas, has, proposed, a, model, of, communicative, reason, that, sees, it, as, an, essentially, cooperative, activity, based, on, the, fact, of, linguistic, intersubjectivity, nikolas, kompridis, proposed, a, widely, encompassing, view, of, reason, as, that, ensemble, of, practices, that, contributes, to, the, opening, and, preserving, of, openness, in, human, affairs, and, a, focus, on, reason, s, possibilities, for, social, change, the, philosopher, charles, taylor, influenced, by, the, 20th, century, german, philosopher, martin, heidegger, proposed, that, reason, ought, to, include, the, faculty, of, disclosure, which, is, tied, to, the, way, we, make, sense, of, things, in, everyday, life, as, a, new, department, of, reason, in, the, essay, what, is, enlightenment, michel, foucault, proposed, a, critique, based, on, kant, s, distinction, between, private, and, public, uses, of, reason, the, terms, logic, or, logical, are, sometimes, used, as, if, they, were, identical, with, reason, or, rational, or, sometimes, logic, is, seen, as, the, most, pure, or, the, defining, form, of, reason, logic, is, about, reasoning, about, going, from, premises, to, a, conclusion, when, you, do, logic, you, try, to, clarify, reasoning, and, separate, good, from, bad, reasoning, in, modern, economics, rational, choice, is, assumed, to, equate, to, logically, consistent, choice, however, reason, and, logic, can, be, thought, of, as, distinct, although, logic, is, one, important, aspect, of, reason, author, douglas, hofstadter, in, g, del, escher, bach, characterizes, the, distinction, in, this, way, logic, is, done, inside, a, system, while, reason, is, done, outside, the, system, by, such, methods, as, skipping, steps, working, backward, drawing, diagrams, looking, at, examples, or, seeing, what, happens, if, you, change, the, rules, of, the, system, psychologists, mark, h, bickard, and, robert, l, campbell, argue, that, rationality, cannot, be, simply, assimilated, to, logicality, they, note, that, human, knowledge, of, logic, and, logical, systems, has, developed, over, time, through, reasoning, and, logical, systems, can, t, construct, new, logical, systems, more, powerful, than, themselves, so, reasoning, and, rationality, must, involve, more, than, a, system, of, logic, psychologist, david, moshman, citing, bickhard, and, campbell, argues, for, a, metacognitive, conception, of, rationality, in, which, a, person, s, development, of, reason, involves, increasing, consciousness, and, control, of, logical, and, other, inferences, reason, is, a, type, of, thought, and, logic, involves, the, attempt, to, describe, a, system, of, formal, rules, or, norms, of, appropriate, reasoning, the, oldest, surviving, writing, to, explicitly, consider, the, rules, by, which, reason, operates, are, the, works, of, the, greek, philosopher, aristotle, especially, prior, analytics, and, posterior, analytics, although, the, ancient, greeks, had, no, separate, word, for, logic, as, distinct, from, language, and, reason, aristotle, s, newly, coined, word, syllogism, syllogismos, identified, logic, clearly, for, the, first, time, as, a, distinct, field, of, study, when, aristotle, referred, to, the, logical, h, logik, he, was, referring, more, broadly, to, rational, thought, as, pointed, out, by, philosophers, such, as, hobbes, locke, and, hume, some, animals, are, also, clearly, capable, of, a, type, of, associative, thinking, even, to, the, extent, of, associating, causes, and, effects, a, dog, once, kicked, can, learn, how, to, recognize, the, warning, signs, and, avoid, being, kicked, in, the, future, but, this, does, not, mean, the, dog, has, reason, in, any, strict, sense, of, the, word, it, also, does, not, mean, that, humans, acting, on, the, basis, of, experience, or, habit, are, using, their, reason, human, reason, requires, more, than, being, able, to, associate, two, ideas, even, if, those, two, ideas, might, be, described, by, a, reasoning, human, as, a, cause, and, an, effect, perceptions, of, smoke, for, example, and, memories, of, fire, for, reason, to, be, involved, the, association, of, smoke, and, the, fire, would, have, to, be, thought, through, in, a, way, that, can, be, explained, for, example, as, cause, and, effect, in, the, explanation, of, locke, for, example, reason, requires, the, mental, use, of, a, third, idea, in, order, to, make, this, comparison, by, use, of, syllogism, more, generally, according, to, charles, sanders, peirce, reason, in, the, strict, sense, requires, the, ability, to, create, and, manipulate, a, system, of, symbols, as, well, as, indices, and, icons, the, symbols, having, only, a, nominal, though, habitual, connection, to, either, for, example, smoke, or, fire, one, example, of, such, a, system, of, symbols, and, signs, is, language, the, connection, of, reason, to, symbolic, thinking, has, been, expressed, in, different, ways, by, philosophers, thomas, hobbes, described, the, creation, of, markes, or, notes, of, remembrance, as, speech, he, used, the, word, speech, as, an, english, version, of, the, greek, word, logos, so, that, speech, did, not, need, to, be, communicated, when, communicated, such, speech, becomes, language, and, the, marks, or, notes, or, remembrance, are, called, signes, by, hobbes, going, further, back, although, aristotle, is, a, source, of, the, idea, that, only, humans, have, reason, logos, he, does, mention, that, animals, with, imagination, for, whom, sense, perceptions, can, persist, come, closest, to, having, something, like, reasoning, and, nous, and, even, uses, the, word, logos, in, one, place, to, describe, the, distinctions, which, animals, can, perceive, in, such, cases, reason, and, imagination, rely, on, similar, mental, processes, imagination, is, not, only, found, in, humans, aristotle, asserted, that, phantasia, imagination, that, which, can, hold, images, or, phantasmata, and, phronein, a, type, of, thinking, that, can, judge, and, understand, in, some, sense, also, exist, in, some, animals, according, to, him, both, are, related, to, the, primary, perceptive, ability, of, animals, which, gathers, the, perceptions, of, different, senses, and, defines, the, order, of, the, things, that, are, perceived, without, distinguishing, universals, and, without, deliberation, or, logos, but, this, is, not, yet, reason, because, human, imagination, is, different, terrence, deacon, and, merlin, donald, writing, about, the, origin, of, language, connect, reason, not, only, to, language, but, also, mimesis, they, describe, the, ability, to, create, language, as, part, of, an, internal, modeling, of, reality, and, specific, to, humankind, other, results, are, consciousness, and, imagination, or, fantasy, in, contrast, modern, proponents, of, a, genetic, predisposition, to, language, itself, include, noam, chomsky, and, steven, pinker, if, reason, is, symbolic, thinking, and, peculiarly, human, then, this, implies, that, humans, have, a, special, ability, to, maintain, a, clear, consciousness, of, the, distinctness, of, icons, or, images, and, the, real, things, they, represent, merlin, donald, writes, 172, a, dog, might, perceive, the, meaning, of, a, fight, that, was, realistically, play, acted, by, humans, but, it, could, not, reconstruct, the, message, or, distinguish, the, representation, from, its, referent, a, real, fight, trained, apes, are, able, to, make, this, distinction, young, children, make, this, distinction, early, hence, their, effortless, distinction, between, play, acting, an, event, and, the, event, itself, in, classical, descriptions, an, equivalent, description, of, this, mental, faculty, is, eikasia, in, the, philosophy, of, plato, ch, 5, this, is, the, ability, to, perceive, whether, a, perception, is, an, image, of, something, else, related, somehow, but, not, the, same, and, therefore, allows, humans, to, perceive, that, a, dream, or, memory, or, a, reflection, in, a, mirror, is, not, reality, as, such, what, klein, refers, to, as, dianoetic, eikasia, is, the, eikasia, concerned, specifically, with, thinking, and, mental, images, such, as, those, mental, symbols, icons, signes, and, marks, discussed, above, as, definitive, of, reason, explaining, reason, from, this, direction, human, thinking, is, special, in, that, we, often, understand, visible, things, as, if, they, were, themselves, images, of, our, intelligible, objects, of, thought, as, foundations, hypoth, ses, in, ancient, greek, this, thinking, dianoia, is, an, activity, which, consists, in, making, the, vast, and, diffuse, jungle, of, the, visible, world, depend, on, a, plurality, of, more, precise, no, ta, 122, both, merlin, donald, and, the, socratic, authors, such, as, plato, and, aristotle, emphasize, the, importance, of, mim, sis, often, translated, as, imitation, or, representation, donald, writes, 169, imitation, is, found, especially, in, monkeys, and, apes, mimesis, is, fundamentally, different, from, imitation, and, mimicry, in, that, it, involves, the, invention, of, intentional, representations, mimesis, is, not, absolutely, tied, to, external, communication, mim, sis, is, a, concept, now, popular, again, in, academic, discussion, that, was, particularly, prevalent, in, plato, s, works, in, aristotle, it, is, discussed, mainly, in, the, poetics, in, michael, davis, s, account, of, the, theory, of, man, in, that, work, it, is, the, distinctive, feature, of, human, action, that, whenever, we, choose, what, we, do, we, imagine, an, action, for, ourselves, as, though, we, were, inspecting, it, from, the, outside, intentions, are, nothing, more, than, imagined, actions, internalizings, of, the, external, all, action, is, therefore, imitation, of, action, it, is, poetic, donald, like, plato, and, aristotle, especially, in, on, memory, and, recollection, emphasizes, the, peculiarity, in, humans, of, voluntary, initiation, of, a, search, through, one, s, mental, world, the, ancient, greek, anamn, sis, normally, translated, as, recollection, was, opposed, to, mneme, or, memory, memory, shared, with, some, animals, requires, a, consciousness, not, only, of, what, happened, in, the, past, but, also, that, something, happened, in, the, past, which, is, in, other, words, a, kind, of, eikasia, 109, but, nothing, except, man, is, able, to, recollect, recollection, is, a, deliberate, effort, to, search, for, and, recapture, something, once, known, klein, writes, that, to, become, aware, of, our, having, forgotten, something, means, to, begin, recollecting, 112, donald, calls, the, same, thing, autocueing, which, he, explains, as, follows, 173, mimetic, acts, are, reproducible, on, the, basis, of, internal, self, generated, cues, this, permits, voluntary, recall, of, mimetic, representations, without, the, aid, of, external, cues, probably, the, earliest, form, of, representational, thinking, in, a, celebrated, paper, the, fantasy, author, and, philologist, j, r, r, tolkien, wrote, in, his, essay, on, fairy, stories, that, the, terms, fantasy, and, enchantment, are, connected, to, not, only, the, satisfaction, of, certain, primordial, human, desires, but, also, the, origin, of, language, and, of, the, mind, a, subdivision, of, philosophy, and, a, variety, of, reasoning, is, logic, the, traditional, main, division, made, in, philosophy, is, between, deductive, reasoning, and, inductive, reasoning, formal, logic, has, been, described, as, the, science, of, deduction, the, study, of, inductive, reasoning, is, generally, carried, out, within, the, field, known, as, informal, logic, or, critical, thinking, deduction, is, a, form, of, reasoning, in, which, a, conclusion, follows, necessarily, from, the, stated, premises, a, deduction, is, also, the, name, for, the, conclusion, reached, by, a, deductive, reasoning, process, a, classic, example, of, deductive, reasoning, is, evident, in, syllogisms, like, the, following, the, reasoning, in, this, argument, is, deductively, valid, because, there, is, no, way, in, which, both, premises, could, be, true, and, the, conclusion, be, false, induction, is, a, form, of, inference, that, produces, properties, or, relations, about, unobserved, objects, or, types, based, on, previous, observations, or, experiences, or, that, formulates, general, statements, or, laws, based, on, limited, observations, of, recurring, phenomenal, patterns, inductive, reasoning, contrasts, with, deductive, reasoning, in, that, even, in, the, strongest, cases, of, inductive, reasoning, the, truth, of, the, premises, does, not, guarantee, the, truth, of, the, conclusion, instead, the, conclusion, of, an, inductive, argument, follows, with, some, degree, of, probability, for, this, reason, also, the, conclusion, of, an, inductive, argument, contains, more, information, than, is, already, contained, in, the, premises, thus, this, method, of, reasoning, is, ampliative, a, classic, example, of, inductive, reasoning, comes, from, the, empiricist, david, hume, analogical, reasoning, is, a, form, of, inductive, reasoning, from, a, particular, to, a, particular, it, is, often, used, in, case, based, reasoning, especially, legal, reasoning, an, example, follows, analogical, reasoning, is, a, weaker, form, of, inductive, reasoning, from, a, single, example, because, inductive, reasoning, typically, uses, a, large, number, of, examples, to, reason, from, the, particular, to, the, general, analogical, reasoning, often, leads, to, wrong, conclusions, for, example, abductive, reasoning, or, argument, to, the, best, explanation, is, a, form, of, reasoning, that, does, not, fit, in, either, the, deductive, or, inductive, categories, since, it, starts, with, incomplete, set, of, observations, and, proceeds, with, likely, possible, explanations, the, conclusion, in, an, abductive, argument, does, not, follow, with, certainty, from, its, premises, and, concerns, something, unobserved, what, distinguishes, abduction, from, the, other, forms, of, reasoning, is, an, attempt, to, favour, one, conclusion, above, others, by, subjective, judgement, or, by, attempting, to, falsify, alternative, explanations, or, by, demonstrating, the, likelihood, of, the, favoured, conclusion, given, a, set, of, more, or, less, disputable, assumptions, for, example, when, a, patient, displays, certain, symptoms, there, might, be, various, possible, causes, but, one, of, these, is, preferred, above, others, as, being, more, probable, flawed, reasoning, in, arguments, is, known, as, fallacious, reasoning, bad, reasoning, within, arguments, can, result, from, either, a, formal, fallacy, or, an, informal, fallacy, formal, fallacies, occur, when, there, is, a, problem, with, the, form, or, structure, of, the, argument, the, word, formal, refers, to, this, link, to, the, form, of, the, argument, an, argument, that, contains, a, formal, fallacy, will, always, be, invalid, an, informal, fallacy, is, an, error, in, reasoning, that, occurs, due, to, a, problem, with, the, content, rather, than, the, form, or, structure, of, the, argument, in, law, relating, to, the, actions, of, an, employer, or, a, public, body, a, decision, or, action, which, falls, outside, the, range, of, actions, or, decision, available, when, acting, in, good, faith, can, be, described, as, unreasonable, use, of, the, term, is, considered, in, the, english, law, cases, of, short, v, poole, corporation, 1926, associated, provincial, picture, houses, ltd, v, wednesbury, corporation, 1947, and, braganza, v, bp, shipping, limited, 2015, philosophy, is, often, characterized, as, a, pursuit, of, rational, understanding, entailing, a, more, rigorous, and, dedicated, application, of, human, reasoning, than, commonly, employed, philosophers, have, long, debated, two, fundamental, questions, regarding, reason, essentially, examining, reasoning, itself, as, a, human, endeavor, or, philosophizing, about, philosophizing, the, first, question, delves, into, whether, we, can, place, our, trust, in, reason, s, ability, to, attain, knowledge, and, truth, more, effectively, than, alternative, methods, the, second, question, explores, whether, a, life, guided, by, reason, a, life, that, aims, to, be, guided, by, reason, can, be, expected, to, lead, to, greater, happiness, compared, to, other, approaches, to, life, since, classical, antiquity, a, question, has, remained, constant, in, philosophical, debate, sometimes, seen, as, a, conflict, between, platonism, and, aristotelianism, concerning, the, role, of, reason, in, confirming, truth, people, use, logic, deduction, and, induction, to, reach, conclusions, they, think, are, true, conclusions, reached, in, this, way, are, considered, according, to, aristotle, more, certain, than, sense, perceptions, on, their, own, on, the, other, hand, if, such, reasoned, conclusions, are, only, built, originally, upon, a, foundation, of, sense, perceptions, then, our, most, logical, conclusions, can, never, be, said, to, be, certain, because, they, are, built, upon, the, very, same, fallible, perceptions, they, seek, to, better, this, leads, to, the, question, of, what, types, of, first, principles, or, starting, points, of, reasoning, are, available, for, someone, seeking, to, come, to, true, conclusions, in, greek, first, principles, are, archai, starting, points, and, the, faculty, used, to, perceive, them, is, sometimes, referred, to, in, aristotle, and, plato, as, nous, which, was, close, in, meaning, to, awareness, or, consciousness, empiricism, sometimes, associated, with, aristotle, but, more, correctly, associated, with, british, philosophers, such, as, john, locke, and, david, hume, as, well, as, their, ancient, equivalents, such, as, democritus, asserts, that, sensory, impressions, are, the, only, available, starting, points, for, reasoning, and, attempting, to, attain, truth, this, approach, always, leads, to, the, controversial, conclusion, that, absolute, knowledge, is, not, attainable, idealism, associated, with, plato, and, his, school, claims, that, there, is, a, higher, reality, within, which, certain, people, can, directly, discover, truth, without, needing, to, rely, only, upon, the, senses, and, that, this, higher, reality, is, therefore, the, primary, source, of, truth, philosophers, such, as, plato, aristotle, al, farabi, avicenna, averroes, maimonides, aquinas, and, hegel, are, sometimes, said, to, have, argued, that, reason, must, be, fixed, and, discoverable, perhaps, by, dialectic, analysis, or, study, in, the, vision, of, these, thinkers, reason, is, divine, or, at, least, has, divine, attributes, such, an, approach, allowed, religious, philosophers, such, as, thomas, aquinas, and, tienne, gilson, to, try, to, show, that, reason, and, revelation, are, compatible, according, to, hegel, the, only, thought, which, philosophy, brings, with, it, to, the, contemplation, of, history, is, the, simple, conception, of, reason, that, reason, is, the, sovereign, of, the, world, that, the, history, of, the, world, therefore, presents, us, with, a, rational, process, since, the, 17th, century, rationalists, reason, has, often, been, taken, to, be, a, subjective, faculty, or, rather, the, unaided, ability, pure, reason, to, form, concepts, for, descartes, spinoza, and, leibniz, this, was, associated, with, mathematics, kant, attempted, to, show, that, pure, reason, could, form, concepts, time, and, space, that, are, the, conditions, of, experience, kant, made, his, argument, in, opposition, to, hume, who, denied, that, reason, had, any, role, to, play, in, experience, after, plato, and, aristotle, western, literature, often, treated, reason, as, being, the, faculty, that, trained, the, passions, and, appetites, stoic, philosophy, by, contrast, claimed, most, emotions, were, merely, false, judgements, according, to, the, stoics, the, only, good, is, virtue, and, the, only, evil, is, vice, therefore, emotions, that, judged, things, other, than, vice, to, be, bad, such, as, fear, or, distress, or, things, other, than, virtue, to, be, good, such, as, greed, were, simply, false, judgements, and, should, be, discarded, though, positive, emotions, based, on, true, judgements, such, as, kindness, were, acceptable, after, the, critiques, of, reason, in, the, early, enlightenment, the, appetites, were, rarely, discussed, or, were, conflated, with, the, passions, some, enlightenment, camps, took, after, the, stoics, to, say, reason, should, oppose, passion, rather, than, order, it, while, others, like, the, romantics, believed, that, passion, displaces, reason, as, in, the, maxim, follow, your, heart, reason, has, been, seen, as, cold, an, enemy, of, mystery, and, ambiguity, a, slave, or, judge, of, the, passions, notably, in, the, work, of, david, hume, and, more, recently, of, freud, reasoning, that, claims, the, object, of, a, desire, is, demanded, by, logic, alone, is, called, rationalization, rousseau, first, proposed, in, his, second, discourse, that, reason, and, political, life, is, not, natural, and, is, possibly, harmful, to, mankind, he, asked, what, really, can, be, said, about, what, is, natural, to, mankind, what, other, than, reason, and, civil, society, best, suits, his, constitution, rousseau, saw, two, principles, prior, to, reason, in, human, nature, first, we, hold, an, intense, interest, in, our, own, well, being, secondly, we, object, to, the, suffering, or, death, of, any, sentient, being, especially, one, like, ourselves, these, two, passions, lead, us, to, desire, more, than, we, could, achieve, we, become, dependent, upon, each, other, and, on, relationships, of, authority, and, obedience, this, effectively, puts, the, human, race, into, slavery, rousseau, says, that, he, almost, dares, to, assert, that, nature, does, not, destine, men, to, be, healthy, according, to, richard, velkley, rousseau, outlines, certain, programs, of, rational, self, correction, most, notably, the, political, legislation, of, the, contrat, social, and, the, moral, education, in, mile, all, the, same, rousseau, understands, such, corrections, to, be, only, ameliorations, of, an, essentially, unsatisfactory, condition, that, of, socially, and, intellectually, corrupted, humanity, this, quandary, presented, by, rousseau, led, to, kant, s, new, way, of, justifying, reason, as, freedom, to, create, good, and, evil, these, therefore, are, not, to, be, blamed, on, nature, or, god, in, various, ways, german, idealism, after, kant, and, major, later, figures, such, nietzsche, bergson, husserl, scheler, and, heidegger, remain, preoccupied, with, problems, coming, from, the, metaphysical, demands, or, urges, of, reason, rousseau, and, these, later, writers, also, exerted, a, large, influence, on, art, and, politics, many, writers, such, as, nikos, kazantzakis, extol, passion, and, disparage, reason, in, politics, modern, nationalism, comes, from, rousseau, s, argument, that, rationalist, cosmopolitanism, brings, man, ever, further, from, his, natural, state, in, descartes, error, antonio, damasio, presents, the, somatic, marker, hypothesis, which, states, that, emotions, guide, behavior, and, decision, making, damasio, argues, that, these, somatic, markers, known, collectively, as, gut, feelings, are, intuitive, signals, that, direct, our, decision, making, processes, in, a, certain, way, that, cannot, be, solved, with, rationality, alone, damasio, further, argues, that, rationality, requires, emotional, input, in, order, to, function, there, are, many, religious, traditions, some, of, which, are, explicitly, fideist, and, others, of, which, claim, varying, degrees, of, rationalism, secular, critics, sometimes, accuse, all, religious, adherents, of, irrationality, they, claim, such, adherents, are, guilty, of, ignoring, suppressing, or, forbidding, some, kinds, of, reasoning, concerning, some, subjects, such, as, religious, dogmas, moral, taboos, etc, though, theologies, and, religions, such, as, classical, monotheism, typically, do, not, admit, to, being, irrational, there, is, often, a, perceived, conflict, or, tension, between, faith, and, tradition, on, the, one, hand, and, reason, on, the, other, as, potentially, competing, sources, of, wisdom, law, and, truth, religious, adherents, sometimes, respond, by, arguing, that, faith, and, reason, can, be, reconciled, or, have, different, non, overlapping, domains, or, that, critics, engage, in, a, similar, kind, of, irrationalism, some, commentators, have, claimed, that, western, civilization, can, be, almost, defined, by, its, serious, testing, of, the, limits, of, tension, between, unaided, reason, and, faith, in, revealed, truths, figuratively, summarized, as, athens, and, jerusalem, respectively, leo, strauss, spoke, of, a, greater, west, that, included, all, areas, under, the, influence, of, the, tension, between, greek, rationalism, and, abrahamic, revelation, including, the, muslim, lands, he, was, particularly, influenced, by, the, muslim, philosopher, al, farabi, to, consider, to, what, extent, eastern, philosophy, might, have, partaken, of, these, important, tensions, strauss, thought, it, best, to, consider, whether, dharma, or, tao, may, be, equivalent, to, nature, physis, in, greek, according, to, strauss, the, beginning, of, philosophy, involved, the, discovery, or, invention, of, nature, and, the, pre, philosophical, equivalent, of, nature, was, supplied, by, such, notions, as, custom, or, ways, which, appear, to, be, really, universal, in, all, times, and, places, the, philosophical, concept, of, nature, or, natures, as, a, way, of, understanding, archai, first, principles, of, knowledge, brought, about, a, peculiar, tension, between, reasoning, on, the, one, hand, and, tradition, or, faith, on, the, other, scientific, research, into, reasoning, is, carried, out, within, the, fields, of, psychology, and, cognitive, science, psychologists, attempt, to, determine, whether, or, not, people, are, capable, of, rational, thought, in, a, number, of, different, circumstances, assessing, how, well, someone, engages, in, reasoning, is, the, project, of, determining, the, extent, to, which, the, person, is, rational, or, acts, rationally, it, is, a, key, research, question, in, the, psychology, of, reasoning, and, cognitive, science, of, reasoning, rationality, is, often, divided, into, its, respective, theoretical, and, practical, counterparts, experimental, cognitive, psychologists, carry, out, research, on, reasoning, behaviour, such, research, may, focus, for, example, on, how, people, perform, on, tests, of, reasoning, such, as, intelligence, or, iq, tests, or, on, how, well, people, s, reasoning, matches, ideals, set, by, logic, see, for, example, the, wason, test, experiments, examine, how, people, make, inferences, from, conditionals, like, if, a, then, b, and, how, they, make, inferences, about, alternatives, like, a, or, else, b, they, test, whether, people, can, make, valid, deductions, about, spatial, and, temporal, relations, like, a, is, to, the, left, of, b, or, a, happens, after, b, and, about, quantified, assertions, like, all, the, a, are, b, experiments, investigate, how, people, make, inferences, about, factual, situations, hypothetical, possibilities, probabilities, and, counterfactual, situations, developmental, psychologists, investigate, the, development, of, reasoning, from, birth, to, adulthood, piaget, s, theory, of, cognitive, development, was, the, first, complete, theory, of, reasoning, development, subsequently, several, alternative, theories, were, proposed, including, the, neo, piagetian, theories, of, cognitive, development, the, biological, functioning, of, the, brain, is, studied, by, neurophysiologists, cognitive, neuroscientists, and, neuropsychologists, this, includes, research, into, the, structure, and, function, of, normally, functioning, brains, and, of, damaged, or, otherwise, unusual, brains, in, addition, to, carrying, out, research, into, reasoning, some, psychologists, for, example, clinical, psychologists, and, psychotherapists, work, to, alter, people, s, reasoning, habits, when, those, habits, are, unhelpful, in, artificial, intelligence, and, computer, science, scientists, study, and, use, automated, reasoning, for, diverse, applications, including, automated, theorem, proving, the, formal, semantics, of, programming, languages, and, formal, specification, in, software, engineering, meta, reasoning, is, reasoning, about, reasoning, in, computer, science, a, system, performs, meta, reasoning, when, it, is, reasoning, about, its, own, operation, this, requires, a, programming, language, capable, of, reflection, the, ability, to, observe, and, modify, its, own, structure, and, behaviour, a, species, could, benefit, greatly, from, better, abilities, to, reason, about, predict, and, understand, the, world, french, social, and, cognitive, scientists, dan, sperber, and, hugo, mercier, argue, that, aside, from, these, benefits, there, could, have, been, other, forces, driving, the, evolution, of, reason, they, point, out, that, reasoning, is, very, difficult, for, humans, to, do, effectively, and, that, it, is, hard, for, individuals, to, doubt, their, own, beliefs, confirmation, bias, reasoning, is, most, effective, when, it, is, done, as, a, collective, as, demonstrated, by, the, success, of, projects, like, science, they, suggest, that, there, are, not, just, individual, but, group, selection, pressures, at, play, any, group, that, managed, to, find, ways, of, reasoning, effectively, would, reap, benefits, for, all, its, members, increasing, their, fitness, this, could, also, help, explain, why, humans, according, to, sperber, are, not, optimized, to, reason, effectively, alone, sperber, s, mercier, s, argumentative, theory, of, reasoning, claims, that, reason, may, have, more, to, do, with, winning, arguments, than, with, the, search, for, the, truth, aristotle, famously, described, reason, with, language, as, a, part, of, human, nature, because, of, which, it, is, best, for, humans, to, live, politically, meaning, in, communities, of, about, the, size, and, type, of, a, small, city, state, polis, in, greek, for, example, it, is, clear, then, that, a, human, being, is, more, of, a, political, politikon, of, the, polis, animal, than, is, any, bee, or, than, any, of, those, animals, that, live, in, herds, for, nature, as, we, say, makes, nothing, in, vain, and, humans, are, the, only, animals, who, possess, reasoned, speech, voice, of, course, serves, to, indicate, what, is, painful, and, pleasant, that, is, why, it, is, also, found, in, other, animals, because, their, nature, has, reached, the, point, where, they, can, perceive, what, is, painful, and, pleasant, and, express, these, to, each, other, but, speech, serves, to, make, plain, what, is, advantageous, and, harmful, and, so, also, what, is, just, and, unjust, for, it, is, a, peculiarity, of, humans, in, contrast, to, the, other, animals, to, have, perception, of, good, and, bad, just, and, unjust, and, the, like, and, the, community, in, these, things, makes, a, household, or, city, by, nature, then, the, drive, for, such, a, community, exists, in, everyone, but, the, first, to, set, one, up, is, responsible, for, things, of, very, great, goodness, for, as, humans, are, the, best, of, all, animals, when, perfected, so, they, are, the, worst, when, divorced, from, law, and, right, the, reason, is, that, injustice, is, most, difficult, to, deal, with, when, furnished, with, weapons, and, the, weapons, a, human, being, has, are, meant, by, nature, to, go, along, with, prudence, and, virtue, but, it, is, only, too, possible, to, turn, them, to, contrary, uses, consequently, if, a, human, being, lacks, virtue, he, is, the, most, unholy, and, savage, thing, and, when, it, comes, to, sex, and, food, the, worst, but, justice, is, something, political, for, right, is, the, arrangement, of, the, political, community, and, right, is, discrimination, of, what, is, just, i, 2, 1253a, if, human, nature, is, fixed, in, this, way, we, can, define, what, type, of, community, is, always, best, for, people, this, argument, has, remained, a, central, argument, in, all, political, ethical, and, moral, thinking, since, then, and, has, become, especially, controversial, since, firstly, rousseau, s, second, discourse, and, secondly, the, theory, of, evolution, already, in, aristotle, there, was, an, awareness, that, the, polis, had, not, always, existed, and, had, to, be, invented, or, developed, by, humans, themselves, the, household, came, first, and, the, first, villages, and, cities, were, just, extensions, of, that, with, the, first, cities, being, run, as, if, they, were, still, families, with, kings, acting, like, fathers, i, 2, 1252b15, friendship, seems, to, prevail, in, man, and, woman, according, to, nature, for, people, are, by, nature, pairing, more, than, political, in, as, much, as, the, household, is, prior, and, more, necessary, than, the, polis, and, making, children, is, more, common, with, the, animals, in, the, other, animals, community, goes, no, further, than, this, but, people, live, together, not, only, for, the, sake, of, making, children, but, also, for, the, things, for, life, for, from, the, start, the, functions, are, divided, and, are, different, for, man, and, woman, thus, they, supply, each, other, putting, their, own, into, the, common, it, is, for, these, reasons, that, both, utility, and, pleasure, seem, to, be, found, in, this, kind, of, friendship, viii, 12, rousseau, in, his, second, discourse, finally, took, the, shocking, step, of, claiming, that, this, traditional, account, has, things, in, reverse, with, reason, language, and, rationally, organized, communities, all, having, developed, over, a, long, period, of, time, merely, as, a, result, of, the, fact, that, some, habits, of, cooperation, were, found, to, solve, certain, types, of, problems, and, that, once, such, cooperation, became, more, important, it, forced, people, to, develop, increasingly, complex, cooperation, often, only, to, defend, themselves, from, each, other, in, other, words, according, to, rousseau, reason, language, and, rational, community, did, not, arise, because, of, any, conscious, decision, or, plan, by, humans, or, gods, nor, because, of, any, pre, existing, human, nature, as, a, result, he, claimed, living, together, in, rationally, organized, communities, like, modern, humans, is, a, development, with, many, negative, aspects, compared, to, the, original, state, of, man, as, an, ape, if, anything, is, specifically, human, in, this, theory, it, is, the, flexibility, and, adaptability, of, humans, this, view, of, the, animal, origins, of, distinctive, human, characteristics, later, received, support, from, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, the, two, competing, theories, concerning, the, origins, of, reason, are, relevant, to, political, and, ethical, thought, because, according, to, the, aristotelian, theory, a, best, way, of, living, together, exists, independently, of, historical, circumstances, according, to, rousseau, we, should, even, doubt, that, reason, language, and, politics, are, a, good, thing, as, opposed, to, being, simply, the, best, option, given, the, particular, course, of, events, that, led, to, today, rousseau, s, theory, that, human, nature, is, malleable, rather, than, fixed, is, often, taken, to, imply, for, example, by, karl, marx, a, wider, range, of, possible, ways, of, living, together, than, traditionally, known, however, while, rousseau, s, initial, impact, encouraged, bloody, revolutions, against, traditional, politics, including, both, the, french, revolution, and, the, russian, revolution, his, own, conclusions, about, the, best, forms, of, community, seem, to, have, been, remarkably, classical, in, favor, of, city, states, such, as, geneva, and, rural, living
