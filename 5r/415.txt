jinn, arabic, also, romanized, as, djinn, or, anglicized, as, genies, are, invisible, creatures, in, early, pre, islamic, arabia, and, later, in, islamic, culture, and, beliefs, like, humans, they, are, accountable, for, their, deeds, and, can, be, either, believers, muslims, or, disbelievers, kafir, depending, on, whether, they, accept, god, s, guidance, jinn, are, neither, innately, evil, nor, innately, good, jinn, are, not, a, strictly, islamic, concept, having, been, adapted, from, pagan, beliefs, islam, places, jinn, and, humans, on, the, same, plane, in, relation, to, god, both, being, subject, to, god, s, judgement, and, an, afterlife, the, quran, condemns, the, pre, islamic, arabian, practice, of, worshipping, or, seeking, protection, from, them, although, usually, invisible, jinn, are, supposed, to, be, composed, of, thin, and, subtle, bodies, arabic, romanized, ajs, m, and, can, change, at, will, they, favor, a, cockroach, or, a, snake, form, but, can, also, choose, to, appear, as, scorpions, lizards, or, humans, they, may, even, engage, in, sexual, affairs, with, humans, and, produce, offspring, if, they, are, injured, by, someone, they, usually, seek, revenge, or, possess, the, assailant, s, body, requiring, exorcism, jinn, rarely, meddle, in, human, affairs, preferring, to, live, with, their, own, kind, in, tribes, similar, to, those, of, pre, islamic, arabia, individual, jinn, appear, on, charms, and, talismans, they, are, called, upon, for, protection, or, magical, aid, often, under, the, leadership, of, a, king, many, people, who, believe, in, jinn, wear, amulets, to, protect, themselves, against, the, assaults, of, the, jinn, sent, out, by, sorcerers, and, witches, a, commonly, held, belief, is, that, jinn, cannot, hurt, someone, who, wears, something, with, the, name, of, god, written, on, it, while, some, muslim, scholars, in, the, past, had, ambivalent, attitudes, towards, jinn, contemporary, muslim, scholarship, increasingly, associate, jinn, with, idolatry, jinn, is, an, arabic, collective, noun, deriving, from, the, semitic, root, jnn, arabic, jann, whose, primary, meaning, is, to, hide, or, to, adapt, some, authors, interpret, the, word, to, mean, literally, beings, that, are, concealed, from, the, senses, cognates, include, the, arabic, majn, n, possessed, or, generally, insane, jannah, garden, eden, or, heaven, and, jan, n, embryo, jinn, is, properly, treated, as, a, plural, however, in, classical, arabic, may, also, appear, as, j, nn, with, the, singular, being, jinn, which, the, english, word, genie, is, derived, from, the, origin, of, the, word, jinn, remains, uncertain, p22, some, scholars, relate, the, arabic, term, jinn, to, the, latin, genius, a, guardian, spirit, of, people, and, places, in, roman, religion, as, a, result, of, syncretism, during, the, reign, of, the, roman, empire, under, tiberius, and, augustus, however, this, derivation, is, also, disputed, p25, supporters, argue, that, both, roman, genii, as, well, as, arabian, jinn, are, considered, to, be, lesser, deities, inhabiting, local, sanctuaries, trees, or, springs, and, persons, or, families, aramaic, ginnaya, classical, syriac, with, the, meaning, of, tutelary, deity, p24, or, guardian, are, attributed, to, similar, functions, and, are, another, possible, origin, of, the, term, jinn, another, suggestion, holds, that, the, word, is, of, persian, origin, and, appeared, in, the, form, of, the, avestic, jaini, a, wicked, female, spirit, jaini, were, among, various, creatures, in, the, possibly, even, pre, zoroastrian, mythology, of, peoples, of, iran, wensick, advocates, a, purely, arabic, origin, of, the, term, asserting, that, according, to, the, common, semitic, view, psychic, and, bodily, affections, are, caused, by, spirits, an, object, reacting, upon, such, an, affect, would, be, an, incarnation, of, said, spirit, since, these, spirits, are, covered, from, the, sight, of, humans, they, would, have, been, called, jinn, p45, the, anglicized, form, genie, is, a, borrowing, of, the, french, g, nie, also, from, the, latin, genius, it, first, appeared, in, 18th, century, translations, of, the, thousand, and, one, nights, from, the, french, where, it, had, been, used, owing, to, its, rough, similarity, in, sound, and, sense, and, further, applies, to, benevolent, intermediary, spirits, in, contrast, to, the, malevolent, spirits, called, demon, and, heavenly, angels, in, literature, in, assyrian, art, creatures, ontologically, between, humans, and, divinities, are, also, called, genie, though, not, a, precise, fit, descriptive, analogies, that, have, been, used, for, these, beings, in, western, thought, include, demon, spirit, sprite, and, fairy, depending, on, source, p22, in, turn, the, arabic, translation, for, the, greek, nymph, ar, sa, is, also, used, for, jinn, by, middle, eastern, sources, p43, although, the, term, spirit, is, frequently, used, it, has, been, criticised, for, not, capturing, the, corporeal, nature, of, the, jinn, and, that, the, term, genie, should, be, used, instead, the, exact, origins, of, belief, in, jinn, are, not, entirely, clear, pp, 1, 10, belief, in, jinn, in, pre, islamic, arab, religion, is, testified, not, only, by, the, quran, but, also, by, pre, islamic, arabic, poetry, p54, some, scholars, of, the, middle, east, hold, that, they, originated, as, malevolent, spirits, residing, in, deserts, and, unclean, places, who, often, took, the, forms, of, animals, p, 1, 10, others, hold, that, they, were, originally, pagan, nature, deities, who, gradually, became, marginalized, as, other, deities, took, greater, importance, pp, 1, 10, jinn, were, already, worshipped, by, many, arabs, during, in, pre, islamic, arabia, p54, julius, wellhausen, observed, that, jinn, were, often, thought, to, inhabit, or, haunt, desolate, dark, and, dingy, places, in, the, desert, for, that, reason, they, were, held, responsible, for, various, diseases, and, mental, illnesses, pp, 1, 10, emilie, savage, smith, asserts, that, malicious, jinn, and, good, gods, were, distinct, in, pre, islamic, arabia, but, admits, that, such, distinction, is, not, absolute, p39, in, the, regions, north, to, the, hejaz, palmyra, and, baalbek, the, terms, jinni, and, ilah, deity, were, often, used, interchangeably, julius, wellhausen, likewise, agrees, that, in, pre, islamic, arabia, it, was, assumed, there, are, at, least, some, friendly, and, helpful, beings, among, the, jinn, he, distinguishes, between, a, god, and, a, jinni, not, on, the, basis, of, morality, but, on, the, basis, of, worship, the, jinn, are, worshipped, in, private, while, the, gods, are, worshipped, in, public, p39, al, jahiz, credits, the, pre, islamic, arabs, with, believing, that, the, society, of, jinn, constitutes, several, tribes, and, groups, analogous, to, pre, islamic, arabian, culture, jinn, could, also, protect, marry, kidnap, possess, and, kill, people, p, 424, despite, being, invisible, jinn, are, considered, to, have, bodies, ajs, m, as, described, by, zakariya, al, qazwini, they, are, among, animals, along, with, humans, burdened, beasts, like, horses, cattle, wild, beasts, birds, and, reptiles, p135, jinn, are, further, known, as, shapeshifters, often, assuming, the, form, of, an, animal, favoring, the, form, of, a, snake, other, chthonic, animals, regarded, as, forms, of, jinn, include, scorpions, and, lizards, both, scorpions, and, serpents, have, been, venerated, in, the, ancient, near, east, when, they, shift, into, a, human, form, however, they, are, said, to, stay, partly, animal, and, are, not, fully, human, p164, although, the, power, of, jinn, usually, exceed, those, of, humans, it, is, conceivable, a, man, could, kill, a, jinni, in, single, combat, but, they, are, feared, for, attacking, without, being, seen, some, sources, even, speak, of, killed, jinn, leaving, behind, a, carcass, similar, to, either, a, serpent, or, a, scorpion, despite, that, they, were, often, feared, or, inspired, awe, the, jinn, were, also, pictured, to, befriend, humans, or, have, romantic, feelings, for, them, according, to, common, arabian, belief, pre, islamic, soothsayers, philosophers, and, poets, were, inspired, by, the, jinn, pp, 1, 10, the, arabian, poet, al, a, sh, d, after, 3, 625, is, said, to, have, gotten, his, inspiration, for, his, poetry, by, a, friend, named, mis, al, da, awtu, khal, l, mis, alan, and, further, calls, him, his, jinni, brother, akh, l, jinn, similarly, the, poet, th, bit, d, 54, 674, who, later, converted, to, islam, and, became, known, as, the, poet, of, the, prophet, referred, to, his, jinni, friend, as, his, sharp, sighted, brother, from, the, jinn, wa, akh, min, al, jinn, al, ba, r, the, relationship, between, jinn, and, humans, can, also, be, romantic, in, nature, according, to, one, famous, arabian, story, the, jinni, manzur, fell, in, love, with, a, human, woman, called, habbah, he, is, supposed, to, have, taught, her, the, arts, of, healing, the, mutual, relationship, between, jinn, and, humans, is, different, than, that, of, a, jinni, and, a, soothsayer, k, hin, the, soothsayer, is, presented, as, someone, who, is, totally, controlled, by, the, jinni, entering, the, soothsayer, was, consulted, to, reveal, hidden, information, or, settle, disputes, as, it, was, believed, the, jinn, speaking, through, them, revealed, hidden, knowledge, jinn, are, mentioned, approximately, 29, times, in, the, quran, p21, exclusively, in, meccan, surahs, the, quran, assumes, that, the, audience, is, familiar, with, the, subject, without, elaborating, on, the, jinn, much, further, according, to, the, quran, 51, 56, 56, muhammad, was, sent, as, a, prophet, to, both, human, and, jinn, communities, and, prophets, and, messengers, were, sent, to, both, communities, throughout, the, quran, humans, and, jinn, al, ins, wa, l, jinn, appear, frequently, as, a, pair, designating, their, equal, status, in, regards, of, their, creation, and, rejecting, that, jinn, share, divinity, with, the, creator, p181, the, term, ins, derives, from, anisa, which, means, to, be, familiar, with, and, refers, to, recognisable, familiar, human, beings, in, contrast, the, term, jinn, refers, to, foreign, invisible, or, unknown, anthropomorphic, beings, which, are, nonetheless, subject, to, the, same, considerations, as, the, former, p101, they, were, both, created, to, worship, god, 51, 56, p182, because, they, are, supposed, to, worship, god, from, free, will, they, are, both, able, for, good, and, evil, deeds, 7, 179, 55, 56, p182, they, are, like, humans, rational, beings, formed, of, nations, 7, 38, p182, surah, al, jinn, is, about, the, revelation, to, jinn, the, same, surah, mentions, righteous, jinn, on, one, hand, and, malicious, jinn, on, the, other, p181, the, jinn, can, neither, harm, nor, benefit, humans, for, they, are, occupied, with, looking, after, themselves, and, their, own, place, in, the, cosmos, p185, this, is, in, notable, contrast, to, demons, and, devils, in, the, judeo, christian, tradition, p181, 185, the, quran, does, not, condemn, the, jinn, as, a, source, of, harm, but, by, mistaking, them, for, beings, deserving, cultic, veneration, 72, 6, p41, p185, jinn, and, humans, are, blamed, for, ascribing, divine, attributes, to, another, creature, i, e, jinn, jinn, to, themselves, and, humans, to, the, jinn, p41, p102, in, the, quranic, account, despite, their, similarities, there, are, important, differences, between, the, two, species, whereas, humans, are, made, from, clay, or, dirt, jinn, were, created, from, smokeless, fire, quran, 15, 27, quran, 55, 15, p182, which, is, possibly, the, reason, why, they, are, credited, with, some, extraordinary, abilities, such, as, invisibility, transformation, and, ascending, into, the, air, like, devils, quran, 72, 8, p182, despite, some, superhuman, powers, the, jinn, occupy, no, fundamentally, different, position, in, the, quran, than, humans, like, humans, the, jinn, have, no, knowledge, of, the, future, p182, like, humanity, jinn, face, epistemic, limitations, regarding, the, hidden, occult, have, to, rely, on, god, s, messengers, and, face, eschatological, judgement, p182, in, quranic, interpretation, the, term, jinn, can, be, used, in, two, different, ways, p12, belief, in, jinn, is, not, included, among, the, six, articles, of, islamic, faith, as, belief, in, angels, is, nonetheless, many, muslim, scholars, including, the, hanbal, scholar, ibn, taymiyya, and, the, hir, scholar, ibn, hazm, believe, they, are, essential, to, the, islamic, faith, since, they, are, mentioned, in, the, quran, p33, it, is, generally, accepted, by, the, majority, of, muslim, scholars, that, jinn, can, possess, individuals, this, is, considered, to, be, part, of, the, doctrines, aqidah, of, the, people, of, the, sunnah, ahl, as, sunnah, wal, jammah, a, in, the, tradition, of, ash, ari, p, 68, the, athar, scholars, ibn, taimiyya, and, ibn, qayyim, agree, on, this, matter, from, among, the, sunni, schools, of, theology, only, the, m, tur, d, s, seems, to, debate, possession, al, rustughfan, deemed, jinn, possession, impossible, al, m, tur, d, focuses, on, the, dynamics, between, jinn, and, humans, based, on, quran, 72, 6, he, states, that, seeking, refuge, among, the, jinn, increases, fear, and, anxiety, however, not, because, of, the, jinn, but, due, to, the, psychological, dependence, of, the, individual, towards, external, powers, by, that, he, refers, to, seeking, refuge, among, the, jinn, as, a, form, of, irk, due, to, the, reliance, on, a, created, thing, instead, of, god, p23, the, topic, of, jinn, was, established, as, the, central, basis, for, islamic, demonology, curriculum, ibn, kathir, has, recorded, in, his, work, al, bidaya, wa, l, nihaya, that, ibn, abd, al, barr, has, classified, jinn, into, different, ranks, several, of, them, consisted, of, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, recorded, in, his, work, fath, al, bari, that, the, attribution, of, the, root, of, ifrit, being, derived, from, ifriya, which, means, rebellious, demon, from, the, tradition, of, abu, bakr, the, first, rashidun, caliph, one, example, of, the, ifrit, jinn, was, sakhr, the, demon, who, once, usurped, king, solomon, although, jinn, frequently, appear, in, hagiographic, sufi, literature, and, their, existence, is, never, doubted, they, do, not, play, any, major, role, in, sufi, cosmology, because, of, their, similarities, to, humans, they, function, neither, as, a, model, to, follow, like, angels, nor, tempters, of, the, lower, self, like, satan, and, mostly, feature, in, poetic, anecdotes, the, jinn, are, obligated, to, follow, the, divine, law, shar, a, as, derived, from, the, quran, by, muslim, jurists, faq, h, thus, the, jinn, are, considered, along, with, humans, to, be, mukall, f, believers, among, the, jinn, are, called, muslim, jinn, muslim, l, jinn, since, both, creations, must, perform, the, required, prayers, salah, muslim, jurists, debated, if, one, is, allowed, to, perform, the, prayer, behind, a, jinni, shibli, cites, two, hanbalite, scholars, who, regard, this, as, permissible, without, hesitation, since, muhammad, was, sent, to, jinn, and, humans, both, are, mukall, f, and, subject, to, the, command, to, pray, because, humans, and, jinn, are, capable, of, procreation, muslim, jurists, dealt, with, the, issue, of, permissibility, of, intercourse, between, these, two, types, of, creatures, some, ad, ths, though, considered, fabricated, maw, by, some, muhaddith, hadith, scholars, pushed, the, necessity, for, an, explanation, the, hour, will, come, when, the, children, of, jinn, will, become, many, among, you, among, you, are, those, who, are, expatriated, mugharrab, n, and, this, he, explained, meant, crossed, with, jinn, although, there, are, recorded, cases, between, human, jinn, relationships, most, muslim, jurists, agree, that, such, a, relationship, is, not, permissible, even, those, scholars, who, allowed, such, relationships, still, considered, them, undesirable, makruh, offspring, of, human, jinn, relationships, are, nonetheless, usually, considered, to, be, gifted, and, talented, people, with, special, abilities, the, jinn, also, known, as, albanian, xhindi, turkish, cin, belarusian, were, adopted, by, later, islamic, culture, since, the, quran, affirms, their, existence, although, depictions, are, categorized, into, little, tradition, folklore, and, greater, tradition, official, islam, for, research, purposes, both, depictions, are, largely, the, same, the, quran, does, not, consider, foreign, mythological, beings, to, be, devils, but, entities, erroneously, ascribed, divine, power, to, therefore, jinn, were, considered, a, third, class, of, invisible, beings, often, neutral, or, morally, ambiguous, not, consequently, equated, with, devils, islam, allowed, to, integrate, local, beliefs, about, spirits, and, deities, from, iran, africa, turkey, and, india, into, a, monotheistic, framework, without, demonizing, them, an, example, of, this, can, be, seen, in, the, writings, of, syed, sultan, who, treated, shiva, and, parvati, as, created, beings, and, casts, the, suras, and, asuras, into, the, roles, of, the, jinn, in, islamic, haggadic, tradition, besides, local, deities, the, existence, of, purely, malevolent, spirits, is, also, acknowledged, thus, jinn, exist, alongside, other, mythological, entities, such, as, demons, d, w, and, fairies, par, the, moral, attitude, of, the, jinn, is, usually, associated, with, their, religion, good, jinn, are, usually, considered, muslim, jinn, or, jinn, islam, whereas, unbelieving, jinn, were, tempted, by, the, devils, shayatin, and, are, called, k, fir, jinn, or, jinn, k, fir, besides, islam, they, could, also, practise, christianity, and, judaism, good, jinn, might, teach, people, moral, lessons, and, might, be, benevolent, or, aid, spiritual, persons, such, as, shamans, kam, in, central, asia, or, spiritual, healers, in, senegal, mediha, esenel, s, studies, in, 1940, anatolia, mentions, the, belief, that, spiritually, gifted, people, can, act, as, intermediaries, between, humans, and, jinn, most, of, the, time, jinn, are, believed, not, to, interfere, with, humans, and, live, mostly, in, desolate, or, abandoned, places, this, is, for, example, evident, from, the, turkish, phrase, n, cin, top, oynuyor, it, is, only, when, they, are, angered, or, disturbed, for, example, if, their, children, are, trodden, upon, or, hot, water, is, thrown, on, them, that, they, take, revenge, on, humans, for, this, reason, muslims, utter, destur, permission, before, doing, something, which, might, accidentally, hurt, jinn, such, as, sprinkling, hot, water, on, public, grounds, or, into, bushes, so, present, jinn, are, advised, to, leave, the, place, p, 149, angered, or, straightforwardly, evil, mannered, jinn, could, hurt, people, by, inflicting, physical, damage, causing, illness, or, taking, control, over, a, human, s, body, a, human, can, be, controlled, by, jinn, under, certain, circumstances, the, individual, needs, to, be, in, a, state, of, dha, iyfah, arabic, mental, weakness, feelings, of, insecurity, mental, instability, unhappy, love, and, depression, being, tired, from, the, soul, are, forms, of, dha, iyfah, in, that, case, it, is, believed, that, an, exorcism, is, required, to, save, the, person, from, the, assaulting, jinni, to, protect, oneself, from, jinn, many, muslims, wear, amulets, with, the, name, of, god, graved, on, jinn, are, also, said, to, be, scared, of, iron, pp, 128, 250, and, wolves, p, 34, p, 95, jinn, feature, in, the, magical, realism, genre, introduced, into, turkish, literature, by, latife, tekin, 1983, who, uses, magical, elements, known, from, pre, islamic, and, islamic, anatolian, lore, since, the, 1980s, this, genre, has, become, prominent, in, turkish, literature, the, story, by, tekin, deals, with, folkloric, and, religious, belief, in, a, rationalized, society, contrary, to, the, neutral, to, positive, depiction, of, jinn, in, tekin, s, novels, since, 2004, jinn, have, become, a, common, trope, in, middle, eastern, horror, movies, the, presentation, of, jinn, usually, combines, quranic, with, oral, and, cultural, beliefs, about, jinn, out, of, 89, films, 59, have, direct, references, to, jinn, as, the, antagonist, 12, use, other, sorts, of, demons, while, other, types, of, horror, such, as, the, impending, apocalypse, hauntings, or, ghosts, constitute, only, 14, films, the, popularity, of, jinn, as, a, choice, of, monster, can, best, be, explained, by, their, affirmation, in, the, quran, they, are, still, a, popular, trope, today, a, study, from, 2020, shows, that, jinn, are, still, the, favorite, horror, element, among, teenagers, jinn, further, feature, in, iranian, horror, movies, though, discouraged, by, some, teachings, of, modern, islam, cultural, beliefs, about, jinn, remain, popular, among, muslim, societies, and, their, understanding, of, cosmology, and, anthropology, affirmation, on, the, existence, of, jinn, as, sapient, creatures, living, along, with, humans, is, still, widespread, in, the, middle, eastern, world, and, west, africa, mental, illnesses, are, still, often, attributed, to, jinn, possession, in, modern, iran, evil, jinn, are, often, substituted, by, devils, similarly, in, many, modern, tales, the, term, jinn, is, used, for, div, demon, causing, a, shift, in, meaning, nonetheless, belief, in, jinn, remains, popular, according, to, a, survey, undertaken, by, the, pew, research, center, in, 2012, the, amount, of, muslims, believing, in, jinn, from, bosnia, and, herzegovina, is, higher, than, the, general, european, average, 30, although, only, 21, believe, in, sorcery, and, 13, would, wear, talisman, for, protection, against, jinn, 12, support, offerings, and, appeal, given, to, the, jinn, sleep, paralysis, is, understood, as, a, jinn, attack, by, many, sleep, paralysis, sufferers, in, egypt, as, discovered, by, a, cambridge, neuroscience, study, jalal, simons, rudolph, jalal, hinton, 2013, the, study, found, that, as, many, as, 48, of, those, who, experience, sleep, paralysis, in, egypt, believe, it, to, be, an, assault, by, the, jinn, almost, all, of, these, sleep, paralysis, sufferers, 95, would, recite, verses, from, the, quran, during, sleep, paralysis, to, prevent, future, jinn, attacks, in, addition, some, 9, would, increase, their, daily, islamic, prayer, al, h, to, get, rid, of, these, assaults, by, jinn, sleep, paralysis, is, generally, associated, with, great, fear, in, egypt, especially, if, believed, to, be, supernatural, in, origin, similarly, european, patients, with, a, muslim, background, often, attribute, mental, illnesses, to, jinn, most, common, attributations, to, jinn, are, symptoms, of, hallucination, and, psychotic, symptoms, but, can, also, include, mood, disorders, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, capgras, syndrome, and, epilepsy, it, has, been, noted, that, not, all, muslims, who, believe, in, jinn, believe, they, can, possess, people, furthermore, belief, in, possession, is, not, limited, to, muslims, contrary, to, the, assumption, that, higher, education, is, proportional, to, disenchantment, belief, in, jinn, possession, may, remain, intact, even, after, medical, graduation, although, there, are, very, few, visual, representations, of, jinn, in, islamic, art, when, they, do, appear, it, is, usually, related, to, a, specific, event, or, individual, jinn, visual, representations, of, jinn, appear, in, manuscripts, and, their, existence, is, often, implied, in, works, of, architecture, by, the, presence, of, apotropaic, devices, like, serpents, which, were, intended, to, ward, off, evil, spirits, lastly, king, solomon, is, illustrated, very, often, with, jinn, as, the, commander, of, an, army, that, included, them, in, addition, to, these, representations, of, jinn, in, vicinity, to, kingship, there, were, also, architectural, references, to, jinn, throughout, the, islamic, world, in, the, citadel, of, aleppo, the, entrance, gate, bab, al, hayyat, made, reference, to, jinn, in, the, stone, relief, carvings, of, serpents, likewise, the, water, gate, at, ayyubid, harran, housed, two, copper, sculptures, of, jinn, serving, as, talismans, to, ward, off, both, snakes, and, evil, jinn, in, the, form, of, snakes, p408, alongside, these, depictions, of, the, jinn, found, at, the, aleppo, citadel, depictions, of, the, jinn, can,

these, were, the, jinn, that, belonged, among, solomon, s, army, and, as, solomon, claimed, to, have, control, over, the, jinn, so, did, the, r, m, seljuk, sultan, that, claimed, to, be, the, sulaym, n, of, his, time, p393, in, fact, one, of, the, most, common, representations, of, jinn, are, alongside, or, in, association, with, king, solomon, it, was, thought, that, king, solomon, had, very, close, ties, to, the, jinn, and, even, had, control, over, many, of, them, p399, the, concept, that, a, great, and, just, ruler, has, the, ability, to, command, jinn, was, one, that, extended, far, past, only, king, solomon, it, was, also, thought, that, emperors, such, as, alexander, the, great, could, control, an, army, of, jinn, in, a, similar, way, p399, given, this, association, jinn, were, often, seen, with, solomon, in, a, princely, or, kingly, context, such, as, the, small, animal, like, jinn, sitting, beside, king, solomon, on, his, throne, illustrated, in, an, illuminated, manuscript, of, aja, ib, al, makhluqat, by, zakariya, al, qazwini, written, in, the, 13th, century, in, the, book, of, wonders, compiled, in, the, 14th, century, by, abd, al, hasan, al, isfahani,

king, of, the, jinn, represented, alongside, his, spiritual, helpers, and, alongside, the, corresponding, talismanic, symbols, p27, for, instance, the, red, king, of, tuesday, was, depicted, in, the, book, of, wonders, as, a, sinister, form, astride, a, lion, in, the, same, illustration, he, holds, a, severed, head, and, a, sword, because, the, red, king, of, tuesday, was, aligned, with, mars,

them, p28, the, jinn, had, an, indirect, impact, on, islamic, art, through, the, creation, of, talismans, that, were, alleged, to, guard, the, bearer, from, the, jinn, and, were, enclosed, in, leather, and, included, qur, anic, verses, it, was, not, unusual, for, those, talismans, to, be, inscribed, with, separated, arabic, letters, because, the, separation, of, those, letters, was, thought, to, positively, affect, the, potency, of, the, talisman, overall, an, object, that, was, inscribed, with, the, word, of, allah, was, thought, to, have, the, power, to, ward, off, evil, from, the, person, who, obtained, the, object, though, many, of, these, objects, also, had, astrological, signs, depictions, of, prophets, or, religious, narratives, jinn, might, be, invoked, along, with, demons, and, devils, for, means, of, sorcery, incantation, protection, or, divination, soothsayers, k, hin, are, credited, with, the, ability, to, ask, jinn, about, things, of, the, past, since, their, lives, are, believed, to, last, longer, than, that, of, humans, p73, common, beliefs, regarding, sorcery, and, commanding, jinn, are, attested, in, ibn, al, nadim, s, kit, b, al, fihrist, p141, since, he, locates, such, practises, not, as, a, branch, of, science, or, philosophy, but, rather, in, a, chapter, about, stories, and, fables, the, author, might, not, have, believed, in, the, efficiency, on, sorcery, himself, p141, he, reports, that, the, art, of, commanding, jinn, and, demons, is, traced, back, to, solomon, and, jamshid, the, first, who, would, have, practised, a, lawful, method, of, incantation, is, supposed, to, be, ab, na, r, a, mad, b, hil, l, p142, ibn, nadim, explains, lawful, and, unlawful, subjugating, of, jinn, and, demons, as, distinct, while, the, former, controls, the, jinn, by, the, power, of, god, s, divine, names, the, latter, pleases, demons, and, devils, by, prohibited, offerings, and, sinful, acts, p141, 142, al, j, i, is, another, author, who,

to, have, married, a, daughter, of, satan, and, begotten, a, child, p143, there, is, evidence, that, subjugation, of, spirits, jinn, and, demons, was, also, cultivated, by, various, islamic, authorities, al, abas, who, was, considered, a, reliable, mu, ad, th, scholar, of, ad, th, and, pious, ascetic, wrote, an, extensive, treatise, al, sh, mil, f, al, ba, r, al, k, mil, on, subjugating, demons, and, jinn, p145, according, to, zakariya, al, qazwini, it, was, well, known, that, jinn, obeyed, al, abas, he, gives, an, example, that, al, abas, demonstrated, the, jinn, to, the, famous, scholar, ghaz, l, who, saw, them, as, shadows, on, the, wall, p145, he, professes, that, jinn, only, obey, when, the, individual, turns, away, from, the, temptations, of, creation, and, devoting, oneself, towards, god, p146, the, al, sh, mil, gives, detailed, instructions, for, preparations, of, various, incantations, unlike, for, example, in, the, writings, of, al, razi, the, al, sh, mil, has, no, direct, link, to, hellenistic, or, hermetic, magic, or, philosophy, p148, magic, was, also, used, in, the, ottoman, empire, as, evident, from, the, talismanic, shirts, of, murad, iii,

of, several, supernatural, beings, demons, jinn, the, evil, eye, fever, huma, arabic, devils, lilith, etc, some, of, these, beings, indicate, that, the, work, connects, hebrew, christian, and, islamic, magical, traditions, the, original, work, is, attributed, to, al, bakhi, who, founded, a, system, of, astrological, magic, based, on, neo, platonic, thought, although, many, pages, are, damaged, it, is, possible, to, reconstruct, their, meanings, from, ottoman, copies, each, king, is, depicted, with, helpers, and, associated, talismanic, symbols, in, comparative, mythology, scholars, discuss, the, relationship, between, islamic, notions, of, jinn, and, earlier, jewish, and, christian, ideas, of, supernatural, beings, or, preternatural, creatures, especially, those, of, angels, spirits, and, demons, it, is, widely, agreed, that, the, belief, in, jinn, was, a, common, element, of, the, culture, out, of, which, the, quran, came, one, question, has, concerned, the, degree, to, quranic, jinn, might, be, compared, to, fallen, angels, in, christian, traditions, although, issues, with, this, view, are, that, jinn, are, not, identified, as, angels, and, that, descriptions, of, angels, do, not, involve, their, flying, up, the, sky, to, eavesdrop, on, heavenly, secrets, unlike, jinn, who, do, so, in, surah, 72, patricia, crone, notes, that, like, jinn, the, demons, of, the, testament, of, solomon, ascend, to, the, firmament, and, eavesdrop, on, heavenly, secrets, as, did, demons, of, zoroastrian, cosmology, who, in, addition, encounter, a, heavenly, defense, systems, as,

fate, as, the, jinn, the, shedim, of, the, tanakh, are, said, to, resemble, jinn, p120, like, jinn, among, a, class, of, beings, of, jewish, mythology, belief, jnun, shedim, etc, there, is, a,
