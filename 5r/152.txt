resurrection, or, anastasis, is, the, concept, of, coming, back, to, life, after, death, reincarnation, is, a, similar, process, hypothesized, by, other, religions, which, involves, the, same, person, or, deity, coming, back, to, another, body, disappearance, of, a, body, is, another, similar, but, distinct, belief, in, some, religions, with, the, advent, of, written, records, the, earliest, known, recurrent, theme, of, resurrection, was, in, egyptian, and, canaanite, religions, which, had, cults, of, dying, and, rising, gods, such, as, osiris, and, baal, ancient, greek, religion, generally, emphasised, immortality, but, in, the, mythos, a, number, of, men, and, women, were, made, physically, immortal, as, they, were, resurrected, from, the, dead, the, universal, resurrection, of, the, dead, at, the, end, of, the, world, is, a, standard, eschatological, belief, in, the, abrahamic, religions, as, a, religious, concept, resurrection, is, used, in, two, distinct, respects, the, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, is, a, central, focus, of, christianity, while, most, christians, believe, jesus, resurrection, from, the, dead, and, ascension, to, heaven, was, in, a, material, body, some, believe, it, was, spiritual, like, the, abrahamic, religions, the, dharmic, religions, also, include, belief, in, resurrection, and, reincarnation, there, are, stories, in, buddhism, where, the, power, of, resurrection, was, allegedly, demonstrated, in, chan, or, zen, tradition, in, hinduism, the, core, belief, in, resurrection, reincarnation, is, known, as, sa, s, ra, aside, from, religious, belief, cryonics, and, other, speculative, resurrection, technologies, are, practiced, but, the, resurrection, of, long, dead, bodies, is, not, considered, possible, at, the, current, level, of, scientific, knowledge, resurrection, from, the, latin, noun, resurrectio, onis, from, the, verb, rego, to, make, straight, rule, preposition, sub, under, altered, to, subrigo, and, contracted, to, surgo, surrexi, surrectum, to, rise, get, up, stand, up, preposition, re, again, thus, literally, a, straightening, from, under, again, the, concept, of, resurrection, is, found, in, the, writings, of, some, ancient, non, abrahamic, religions, in, the, middle, east, a, few, extant, egyptian, and, canaanite, writings, allude, to, dying, and, rising, gods, such, as, osiris, and, baal, sir, james, frazer, in, his, book, the, golden, bough, relates, to, these, dying, and, rising, gods, but, many, of, his, examples, according, to, various, scholars, distort, the, sources, taking, a, more, positive, position, tryggve, mettinger, argues, in, his, recent, book, that, the, category, of, rise, and, return, to, life, is, significant, for, ugaritic, baal, melqart, adonis, eshmun, osiris, and, dumuzi, in, ancient, greek, religion, a, number, of, men, and, women, have, been, interpreted, as, being, resurrected, and, made, immortal, achilles, after, being, killed, was, snatched, from, his, funeral, pyre, by, his, divine, mother, thetis, and, brought, to, an, immortal, existence, in, either, leuce, the, elysian, plains, or, the, islands, of, the, blessed, memnon, who, was, killed, by, achilles, seems, to, have, received, a, similar, fate, alcmene, castor, heracles, and, melicertes, are, also, among, the, figures, interpreted, to, have, been, resurrected, to, physical, immortality, according, to, herodotus, s, histories, the, seventh, century, bc, sage, aristeas, of, proconnesus, was, first, found, dead, after, which, his, body, disappeared, from, a, locked, room, he, would, reappear, alive, years, later, however, greek, attitudes, towards, resurrection, were, generally, negative, and, the, idea, of, resurrection, was, considered, neither, desirable, nor, possible, for, example, asclepius, was, killed, by, zeus, for, using, herbs, to, resurrect, the, dead, but, by, his, father, apollo, s, request, was, subsequently, immortalized, as, a, star, many, other, figures, like, a, great, part, of, those, who, fought, in, the, trojan, and, theban, wars, menelaus, and, the, historical, pugilist, cleomedes, of, astupalaea, were, also, believed, to, have, been, made, physically, immortal, but, without, having, died, in, the, first, place, indeed, in, greek, religion, immortality, originally, always, included, an, eternal, union, of, body, and, soul, alcestis, undergoes, something, akin, to, a, resurrection, in, her, escape, from, the, underworld, but, without, achieving, immortality, writing, his, lives, of, illustrious, men, parallel, lives, in, the, first, century, the, middle, platonic, philosopher, plutarch, in, his, chapter, on, romulus, gave, an, account, of, the, king, s, mysterious, disappearance, and, subsequent, deification, comparing, it, to, greek, tales, such, as, the, physical, immortalization, of, alcmene, and, aristeas, the, proconnesian, for, they, say, aristeas, died, in, a, fuller, s, work, shop, and, his, friends, coming, to, look, for, him, found, his, body, vanished, and, that, some, presently, after, coming, from, abroad, said, they, met, him, traveling, towards, croton, plutarch, openly, scorned, such, beliefs, held, in, ancient, greek, religion, writing, many, such, improbabilities, do, your, fabulous, writers, relate, deifying, creatures, naturally, mortal, likewise, he, writes, that, while, something, within, humans, comes, from, the, gods, and, returns, to, them, after, death, this, happens, only, when, it, is, most, completely, separated, and, set, free, from, the, body, and, becomes, altogether, pure, fleshless, and, undefiled, the, parallel, between, these, traditional, beliefs, and, the, later, resurrection, of, jesus, was, not, lost, on, the, early, christians, as, justin, martyr, argued, when, we, say, jesus, christ, our, teacher, was, crucified, and, died, and, rose, again, and, ascended, into, heaven, we, propose, nothing, different, from, what, you, believe, regarding, those, whom, you, consider, sons, of, zeus, 1, apol, 21, there, are, stories, in, buddhism, where, the, power, of, resurrection, was, allegedly, demonstrated, in, chan, or, zen, tradition, one, is, the, legend, of, bodhidharma, the, indian, master, who, brought, the, ekayana, school, of, india, that, subsequently, became, chan, buddhism, to, china, the, other, is, the, passing, of, chinese, chan, master, puhua, japanese, jinshu, fuke, and, is, recounted, in, the, record, of, linji, japanese, rinzai, gigen, puhua, was, known, for, his, unusual, behavior, and, teaching, style, so, it, is, no, wonder, that, he, is, associated, with, an, event, that, breaks, the, usual, prohibition, on, displaying, such, powers, here, is, the, account, from, irmgard, schloegl, s, the, zen, teaching, of, rinzai, one, day, at, the, street, market, fuke, was, begging, all, and, sundry, to, give, him, a, robe, everybody, offered, him, one, but, he, did, not, want, any, of, them, the, master, made, the, superior, buy, a, coffin, and, when, fuke, returned, said, to, him, there, i, had, this, robe, made, for, you, fuke, shouldered, the, coffin, and, went, back, to, the, street, market, calling, loudly, rinzai, had, this, robe, made, for, me, i, am, off, to, the, east, gate, to, enter, transformation, to, die, the, people, of, the, market, crowded, after, him, eager, to, look, fuke, said, no, not, today, tomorrow, i, shall, go, to, the, south, gate, to, enter, transformation, and, so, for, three, days, nobody, believed, it, any, longer, on, the, fourth, day, and, now, without, any, spectators, fuke, went, alone, outside, the, city, walls, and, laid, himself, into, the, coffin, he, asked, a, traveler, who, chanced, by, to, nail, down, the, lid, the, news, spread, at, once, and, the, people, of, the, market, rushed, there, on, opening, the, coffin, they, found, that, the, body, had, vanished, but, from, high, up, in, the, sky, they, heard, the, ring, of, his, hand, bell, in, christianity, resurrection, most, critically, concerns, the, resurrection, of, jesus, but, also, includes, the, resurrection, of, judgment, day, known, as, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, by, those, christians, who, subscribe, to, the, nicene, creed, which, is, the, majority, or, mainstream, christianity, as, well, as, the, resurrection, miracles, done, by, jesus, and, the, prophets, of, the, old, testament, in, the, new, testament, jesus, is, said, to, have, raised, several, persons, from, death, these, resurrections, included, the, daughter, of, jairus, shortly, after, death, a, young, man, in, the, midst, of, his, own, funeral, procession, and, lazarus, of, bethany, who, had, been, buried, for, four, days, during, the, ministry, of, jesus, on, earth, before, his, death, jesus, commissioned, his, twelve, apostles, to, among, other, things, raise, the, dead, similar, resurrections, are, credited, to, the, apostles, and, catholic, saints, in, the, acts, of, the, apostles, saint, peter, raised, a, woman, named, dorcas, also, called, tabitha, and, paul, the, apostle, revived, a, man, named, eutychus, who, had, fallen, asleep, and, fell, from, a, window, to, his, death, according, to, the, gospel, of, matthew, after, jesus, s, resurrection, many, of, those, previously, dead, came, out, of, their, tombs, and, entered, jerusalem, where, they, appeared, to, many, following, the, apostolic, age, many, saints, were, said, to, resurrect, the, dead, as, recorded, in, orthodox, christian, hagiographies, st, columba, supposedly, raised, a, boy, from, the, dead, in, the, land, of, picts, and, st, nicholas, is, said, to, have, resurrected, pickled, children, from, a, brine, barrel, during, a, famine, by, making, the, sign, of, the, cross, christians, regard, the, resurrection, of, jesus, as, the, central, doctrine, in, christianity, others, take, the, incarnation, of, jesus, to, be, more, central, however, it, is, the, miracles, and, particularly, his, resurrection, which, provide, validation, of, his, incarnation, according, to, paul, the, entire, christian, faith, hinges, upon, the, centrality, of, the, resurrection, of, jesus, and, the, hope, for, a, life, after, death, the, apostle, paul, wrote, in, his, first, letter, to, the, corinthians, if, only, for, this, life, we, have, hope, in, christ, we, are, to, be, pitied, more, than, all, men, but, christ, has, indeed, been, raised, from, the, dead, the, first, fruits, of, those, who, have, fallen, asleep, christianity, started, as, a, religious, movement, within, 1st, century, judaism, late, second, temple, judaism, and, it, retains, what, the, new, testament, itself, claims, was, the, pharisaic, belief, in, the, afterlife, and, resurrection, of, the, dead, whereas, this, belief, was, only, one, of, many, beliefs, held, about, the, world, to, come, in, second, temple, judaism, and, was, notably, rejected, by, the, sadducees, but, accepted, by, the, pharisees, cf, acts, 23, 6, 8, belief, in, the, resurrection, became, dominant, within, early, christianity, and, already, in, the, gospels, of, luke, and, john, included, an, insistence, on, the, resurrection, of, the, flesh, most, modern, christian, churches, continue, to, uphold, the, belief, that, there, will, be, a, final, resurrection, of, the, dead, and, world, to, come, belief, in, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, and, jesus, role, as, judge, is, codified, in, the, apostles, creed, which, is, the, fundamental, creed, of, christian, baptismal, faith, the, book, of, revelation, also, makes, many, references, about, the, day, of, judgment, when, the, dead, will, be, raised, there, are, folklore, stories, and, extractions, from, certain, holy, texts, that, refer, to, resurrections, one, major, folklore, is, that, of, savitri, saving, her, husband, s, life, from, yamraj, in, the, ramayana, after, ravana, was, slain, by, rama, in, a, great, battle, between, good, and, evil, rama, requests, the, king, of, devas, indra, to, restore, the, lives, of, all, the, monkeys, who, died, in, the, great, battle, mahavatar, babaji, and, lahiri, mahasaya, are, also, believed, to, have, resurrected, themselves, belief, in, the, day, of, resurrection, yawm, al, qiy, mah, is, also, crucial, for, muslims, they, believe, the, time, of, qiy, mah, is, preordained, by, god, but, unknown, to, man, the, trials, and, tribulations, preceding, and, during, the, qiy, mah, are, described, in, the, quran, and, the, hadith, and, also, in, the, commentaries, of, scholars, the, quran, emphasizes, bodily, resurrection, a, break, from, the, pre, islamic, arabian, understanding, of, death, according, to, nasir, khusraw, d, after, 1070, an, ismaili, thinker, of, the, fatimid, era, the, resurrection, qiy, ma, will, be, ushered, by, the, lord, of, the, resurrection, q, im, al, qiy, ma, an, individual, symbolizing, the, purpose, and, pinnacle, of, creation, from, among, the, progeny, of, muhammad, and, his, imams, through, this, individual, the, world, will, come, out, of, darkness, and, ignorance, and, into, the, light, of, her, lord, quran, 39, 69, his, era, unlike, that, of, the, enunciators, of, the, divine, revelation, n, iqs, before, him, is, not, one, where, god, prescribes, the, people, to, work, but, instead, one, where, god, rewards, them, preceding, the, lord, of, the, resurrection, q, im, is, his, proof, ujjat, the, qur, anic, verse, stating, that, the, night, of, power, laylat, al, qadr, is, better, than, a, thousand, months, quran, 97, 3, is, said, to, refer, to, this, proof, whose, knowledge, is, superior, to, that, of, a, thousand, imams, though, their, rank, collectively, is, one, hakim, nasir, also, recognizes, the, successors, of, the, lord, of, the, resurrection, to, be, his, deputies, khulaf, there, are, three, explicit, examples, in, the, hebrew, bible, of, people, being, resurrected, from, the, dead, according, to, herbert, c, brichto, writing, in, reform, judaism, s, hebrew, union, college, annual, the, family, tomb, is, the, central, concept, in, understanding, biblical, views, of, the, afterlife, brichto, states, that, it, is, not, mere, sentimental, respect, for, the, physical, remains, that, is, the, motivation, for, the, practice, but, rather, an, assumed, connection, between, proper, sepulture, and, the, condition, of, happiness, of, the, deceased, in, the, afterlife, according, to, brichto, the, early, israelites, apparently, believed, that, the, graves, of, family, or, tribe, united, into, one, and, that, this, unified, collectivity, is, to, what, the, biblical, hebrew, term, sheol, refers, the, common, grave, of, humans, although, not, well, defined, in, the, tanakh, sheol, in, this, view, was, a, subterranean, underworld, where, the, souls, of, the, dead, went, after, the, body, died, the, babylonians, had, a, similar, underworld, called, aralu, and, the, ancient, greeks, had, one, known, as, hades, according, to, brichto, other, biblical, names, for, sheol, were, abaddon, ruin, found, in, psalm, 88, 11, job, 28, 22, and, proverbs, 15, 11, bor, pit, found, in, isaiah, 14, 15, 24, 22, ezekiel, 26, 20, and, shakhat, corruption, found, in, isaiah, 38, 17, ezekiel, 28, 8, during, the, second, temple, period, there, developed, a, diversity, of, beliefs, concerning, the, resurrection, the, concept, of, resurrection, of, the, physical, body, is, found, in, 2, maccabees, according, to, which, it, will, happen, through, re, creation, of, the, flesh, resurrection, of, the, dead, also, appears, in, detail, in, the, extra, canonical, book, of, enoch, 2, baruch, and, 2, esdras, according, to, the, british, scholar, in, ancient, judaism, philip, r, davies, there, is, little, or, no, clear, reference, either, to, immortality, or, to, resurrection, from, the, dead, in, the, texts, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, c, d, elledge, however, argues, that, some, form, of, resurrection, may, be, referred, to, in, the, dead, sea, texts, 4q521, pseudo, ezekiel, and, 4qinstruction, too, there, is, the, vision, of, the, valley, of, dry, bones, in, the, book, of, ezekiel, and, the, book, of, daniel, which, mentions, resurrection, as, professor, devorah, dimant, notes, on, thetorah, com, originally, an, allegorical, vision, about, the, future, return, of, judeans, to, their, land, ezekiel, s, vision, ch, 37, becomes, one, of, the, cornerstones, for, the, jewish, belief, in, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, the, only, biblical, passage, that, unambiguously, refers, to, resurrection, is, found, in, the, final, chapter, of, the, book, of, daniel, both, josephus, and, the, new, testament, record, that, the, sadducees, did, not, believe, in, an, afterlife, but, the, sources, vary, on, the, beliefs, of, the, pharisees, the, new, testament, claims, that, the, pharisees, believed, in, the, resurrection, but, does, not, specify, whether, this, included, the, flesh, or, not, according, to, josephus, who, himself, was, a, pharisee, the, pharisees, held, that, only, the, soul, was, immortal, and, the, souls, of, good, people, will, pass, into, other, bodies, while, the, souls, of, the, wicked, will, suffer, eternal, punishment, paul, the, apostle, who, also, was, a, pharisee, said, that, at, the, resurrection, what, is, sown, as, a, natural, body, is, raised, a, spiritual, body, the, book, of, jubilees, seems, to, refer, to, the, resurrection, of, the, soul, only, or, to, a, more, general, idea, of, an, immortal, soul, anastasis, or, ana, stasis, is, a, concept, in, contemporary, philosophy, emerging, from, the, works, of, jean, luc, nancy, divya, dwivedi, and, shaj, mohan, nancy, developed, the, concept, through, his, interpretation, of, paintings, depicting, the, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, dwivedi, and, mohan, referring, to, nancy, defined, ana, stasis, as, coming, over, stasis, which, is, a, method, for, philosophy, to, overcome, its, end, as, martin, heidegger, defined, this, concept, is, noted, to, be, linked, in, the, works, of, nancy, dwivedi, and, mohan, to, have, a, relation, to, heidegger, s, other, beginning, of, philosophy, kohan, and, dwivdei, that, this, overcoming, would, construct, a, new, dimension, in, philosophy, john, hick, argues, that, the, replica, theory, makes, the, religious, doctrine, of, bodily, resurrection, somewhat, plausible, for, example, if, a, man, disappears, or, dies, in, london, and, an, exact, replica, suddenly, re, appears, in, new, york, both, entities, should, be, regarded, as, the, same, especially, if, they, share, physical, and, psychological, characteristics, hick, extends, this, theory, to, parallel, universes, which, occupy, a, different, space, to, our, own, he, also, distinguishes, the, theory, from, reincarnation, where, a, person, lives, in, several, successive, bodies, other, scholars, reivse, the, replica, theory, with, the, counterpart, theory, where, it, is, believed, that, god, creates, a, resurrection, counterpart, to, one, s, current, body, which, is, new, and, improved, although, it, is, defined, by, one, s, soul, and, history, it, is, not, identical, to, the, current, body, which, remains, destroyed, after, death, a, useful, analogy, is, to, imagine, a, soul, as, a, programme, a, body, as, a, computer, and, the, series, of, states, that, a, soul, undergoes, as, a, person, s, biography, they, believe, the, theory, has, precedent, in, scriptures, like, the, new, testament, in, addition, it, incentivizes, people, to, care, about, their, future, cryonics, is, the, low, temperature, freezing, usually, at, 196, c, or, 320, 8, f, or, 77, 1, k, of, a, human, corpse, or, severed, head, with, the, speculative, hope, that, resurrection, may, be, possible, in, the, future, cryonics, is, regarded, with, skepticism, within, the, mainstream, scientific, community, it, is, generally, viewed, as, a, pseudoscience, and, has, been, characterized, as, quackery, in, his, 1988, book, mind, children, roboticist, hans, moravec, proposed, that, a, future, supercomputer, might, be, able, to, resurrect, long, dead, minds, from, the, information, that, still, survived, for, example, such, can, include, information, in, the, form, of, memories, filmstrips, social, media, interactions, modeled, personality, traits, personal, favourite, things, personal, notes, and, tasks, medical, records, and, genetic, information, ray, kurzweil, american, inventor, and, futurist, believes, that, when, his, concept, of, singularity, comes, to, pass, it, will, be, possible, to, resurrect, the, dead, by, digital, recreation, such, is, one, approach, in, the, concept, of, digital, immortality, which, could, be, described, as, resurrecting, deceased, as, digital, ghosts, or, digital, avatars, in, the, context, of, knowledge, management, virtual, persona, could, aid, in, knowledge, capture, retention, distribution, access, and, use, and, continue, to, learn, issues, include, post, mortem, privacy, and, potential, use, of, personalised, digital, twins, and, associated, systems, by, big, data, firms, and, advertisers, related, alternative, approaches, of, digital, immortality, include, gradually, replacing, neurons, in, the, brain, with, advanced, medical, technology, such, as, nanobiotechnology, as, a, form, of, mind, uploading, see, also, wetware, computer, de, extinction, enabling, an, organism, that, either, resembles, or, is, an, extinct, species, is, also, known, as, resurrection, biology, and, often, described, as, working, on, resurrecting, dead, species, modern, medicine, can, in, some, cases, revive, patients, who, died, by, some, definitions, of, death, or, were, declared, dead, however, under, most, definitions, of, death, brain, death, this, would, mean, that, the, patient, wasn, t, truly, dead, most, advanced, versions, of, such, capabilities, may, include, a, method, system, under, development, reported, in, 2019, brainex, that, could, partially, revive, pig, brains, hours, after, death, to, the, degree, of, brain, circulation, and, cellular, functions, it, showed, that, the, process, of, cell, death, is, a, gradual, stepwise, process, and, that, some, of, those, processes, can, be, either, postponed, preserved, or, even, reversed, a, similar, organ, perfusion, system, under, development, organex, can, restore, i, e, on, the, cellular, level, multiple, vital, pig, organs, one, hour, after, death, during, which, the, body, had, prolonged, warm, ischaemia, it, could, be, used, to, preserve, donor, organs, but, may, also, be, developed, to, be, useful, for, revival, in, medical, emergencies, by, buying, more, time, for, doctors, to, treat, people, whose, bodies, were, starved, of, oxygen, such, as, those, who, died, from, drowning, or, heart, attacks, there, is, research, into, what, happens, during, and, after, death, as, well, as, how, and, to, what, extent, patients, could, be, revived, by, the, use, of, science, and, technology, for, example, one, study, showed, that, in, the, hours, after, humans, die, certain, cells, in, the, human, brain, are, still, active, however, it, is, thought, that, at, least, without, any, life, support, like, systems, death, is, permanent, and, irreversible, after, several, hours, not, days, even, in, cases, when, revival, was, still, possible, shortly, after, death, a, 2010, study, notes, that, physicians, are, determining, death, test, only, for, the, permanent, cessation, of, circulation, and, respiration, because, they, know, that, irreversible, cessation, follows, rapidly, and, inevitably, once, circulation, no, longer, will, restore, itself, spontaneously, and, will, not, be, restored, medically, development, of, advanced, live, support, measures, including, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, cpr, and, positive, pressure, ventilation, ppv, brought, the, interdependence, of, cessation, of, brain, function, and, loss, of, respiration, and, circulation, and, the, traditional, definition, of, death, into, question, and, further, developments, upend, more, definitions, of, mortality, russian, cosmist, nikolai, fyodorovich, fyodorov, advocated, resurrection, of, the, dead, using, scientific, methods, fedorov, tried, to, plan, specific, actions, for, scientific, research, of, the, possibility, of, restoring, life, and, making, it, infinite, his, first, project, is, connected, with, collecting, and, synthesizing, decayed, remains, of, dead, based, on, knowledge, and, control, over, all, atoms, and, molecules, of, the, world, the, second, method, described, by, fedorov, is, genetic, hereditary, the, revival, could, be, done, successively, in, the, ancestral, line, sons, and, daughters, restore, their, fathers, and, mothers, they, in, turn, restore, their, parents, and, so, on, this, means, restoring, the, ancestors, using, the, hereditary, information, that, they, passed, on, to, their, children, using, this, genetic, method, it, is, only, possible, to, create, a, genetic, twin, of, the, dead, person, it, is, necessary, to, give, back, the, revived, person, his, old, mind, his, personality, fedorov, speculates, about, the, idea, of, radial, images, that, may, contain, the, personalities, of, the, people, and, survive, after, death, nevertheless, fedorov, noted, that, even, if, a, soul, is, destroyed, after, death, man, will, learn, to, restore, it, whole, by, mastering, the, forces, of, decay, and, fragmentation, in, his, 1994, book, the, physics, of, immortality, american, physicist, frank, j, tipler, an, expert, on, the, general, theory, of, relativity, presented, his, omega, point, theory, which, outlines, how, a, resurrection, of, the, dead, could, take,
