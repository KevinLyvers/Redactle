yinyang, or, yin, yang, is, a, concept, that, originated, in, chinese, philosophy, describing, an, opposite, but, interconnected, self, perpetuating, cycle, yin, and, yang, can, be, thought, of, as, complementary, and, at, the, same, time, opposing, forces, that, interact, to, form, a, dynamic, system, in, which, the, whole, is, greater, than, the, assembled, parts, and, the, parts, are, important, for, cohesion, of, the, whole, in, chinese, cosmology, the, universe, creates, itself, out, of, a, primary, chaos, of, material, energy, organized, into, the, cycles, of, yin, and, yang, form, and, matter, yin, is, retractive, passive, and, contractive, while, yang, is, repelling, active, and, expansive, in, principle, this, dichotomy, in, some, form, is, seen, in, all, things, in, nature, patterns, of, change, and, difference, such, as, biological, and, seasonal, cycles, evolution, of, the, landscape, over, days, weeks, and, eons, with, the, original, meaning, of, the, words, being, the, north, facing, shade, and, the, south, facing, brightness, of, a, hill, gender, female, and, male, as, well, as, the, formation, of, the, character, of, individuals, and, the, grand, arc, of, sociopolitical, history, in, disorder, and, order, taiji, is, a, chinese, cosmological, term, for, the, supreme, ultimate, state, of, undifferentiated, absolute, and, infinite, potential, the, oneness, before, duality, from, which, yin, and, yang, originate, it, can, be, contrasted, with, the, older, wuji, without, pole, in, the, cosmology, pertaining, to, yin, and, yang, the, material, energy, which, this, universe, was, created, from, is, known, as, qi, it, is, believed, that, the, organization, of, qi, in, this, cosmology, of, yin, and, yang, has, formed, many, things, included, among, these, forms, are, humans, many, natural, dualities, such, as, light, and, dark, fire, and, water, expanding, and, contracting, are, thought, of, as, physical, manifestations, of, the, duality, symbolized, by, yin, and, yang, this, duality, as, a, unity, of, opposites, lies, at, the, origins, of, many, branches, of, classical, chinese, science, technology, and, philosophy, as, well, as, being, a, primary, guideline, of, traditional, chinese, medicine, and, a, central, principle, of, different, forms, of, chinese, martial, arts, and, exercise, such, as, baguazhang, tai, chi, daoyin, and, qigong, as, well, as, appearing, in, the, pages, of, the, i, ching, the, notion, of, duality, can, be, found, in, many, areas, such, as, communities, of, practice, the, term, dualistic, monism, or, dialectical, monism, has, been, coined, in, an, attempt, to, express, this, fruitful, paradox, of, simultaneous, unity, and, duality, according, to, this, philosophy, everything, has, both, yin, and, yang, aspects, for, instance, shadow, cannot, exist, without, light, either, of, the, two, major, aspects, may, manifest, more, strongly, in, a, particular, object, depending, on, the, criterion, of, the, observation, the, yin, and, yang, symbol, or, taijitu, shows, a, balance, between, two, opposites, with, a, portion, of, the, opposite, element, in, each, section, in, taoist, metaphysics, distinctions, between, good, and, bad, along, with, other, dichotomous, moral, judgments, are, perceptual, not, real, so, the, duality, of, yin, and, yang, is, an, indivisible, whole, in, the, ethics, of, confucianism, on, the, other, hand, most, notably, in, the, philosophy, of, dong, zhongshu, c, 2nd, century, bc, a, moral, dimension, is, attached, to, the, idea, of, yin, and, yang, the, ahom, philosophy, of, duality, of, the, individual, self, han, and, pu, is, quite, similar, to, yin, and, yang, of, taoism, the, tradition, was, originated, in, yunnan, china, and, followed, by, some, ahom, descendants, of, dai, ethnic, minority, the, chinese, terms, y, n, dark, side, and, y, ng, light, side, have, a, rich, history, in, the, language, their, etymologies, and, evolution, analyzable,

lit, foreign, silver, silver, coin, dollar, but, not, even, the, most, comprehensive, dictionaries, e, g, the, hanyu, da, cidian, enter, yangyin, while, yang, and, yin, can, occur, together, in,

and, negative, b, where, the, a, word, is, dominant, or, privileged, over, b, for, example, tiandi, heaven, and, earth, and, nann, men, and, women, yinyang, meaning, dark, and, light, female, and, male, moon, and, sun, is, an, exception, scholars, have, proposed, various, explanations, for, why, yinyang, violates, this, pattern, including, linguistic, convenience, it, is, easier, to, say, yinyang, than, yangyin, the, idea, that, proto, chinese, society, was, matriarchal, or, perhaps, since, yinyang, first, became, prominent, during, the, late, warring, states, period, this, term, was, purposely, directed, at, challenging, persistent, cultural, assumptions, joseph, needham, discusses, yin, and, yang, together, with, five, elements, as, part, of, the, school, of, naturalists, he, says, that, it, would, be, proper, to, begin, with, yin, and, yang, before, five, elements, because, the, former, lay, as, it, were, at, a, deeper, level, in, nature, and, were, the, most, ultimate, principles, of, which, the, ancient, chinese, could, conceive, but, it, so, happens, that, we, know, a, good, deal, more, about, the, historical, origin, of, the, five, element, theory, than, about, that, of, the, yin, and, the, yang, and, it, will, therefore, be, more, convenient, to, deal, with, it, first, he, then, discusses, zou, yan, 305, 240, bc, who, is, most, associated, with, these, theories, although, yin, and, yang, are, not, mentioned, in, any, of, the, surviving, documents, of, zou, yan, his, school, was, known, as, the, yin, yang, jia, yin, and, yang, school, needham, concludes, there, can, be, very, little, doubt, that, the, philosophical, use, of, the, terms, began, about, the, beginning, of, the, 4th, century, and, that, the, passages, in, older, texts, which, mention, this, use, are, interpolations, made, later, than, that, time, yin, and, yang, are, a, concept, that, originated, in, ancient, chinese, philosophy, that, describes, how, opposite, or, contrary, forces, may, create, each, other, by, their, comparison, and, are, to, be, seen, as, actually, complementary, interconnected, and, interdependent, in, the, natural, world, and, how, they, may, give, rise, to, each, other, as, they, interrelate, to, one, another, in, daoist, philosophy, dark, and, light, yin, and, yang, arrive, in, the, tao, te, ching, at, chapter, 42, it, becomes, sensible, from, an, initial, quiescence, or, emptiness, wuji, sometimes, symbolized, by, an, empty, circle, and, continues, moving, until, quiescence, is, reached, again, for, instance, dropping, a, stone, in, a, calm, pool, of, water, will, simultaneously, raise, waves, and, lower, troughs, between, them, and, this, alternation, of, high, and, low, points, in, the, water, will, radiate, outward, until, the, movement, dissipates, and, the, pool, is, calm, once, more, yin, and, yang, thus, are, always, opposite, and, equal, qualities, and, create, and, control, each, other, whenever, one, quality, reaches, its, peak, it, will, naturally, begin, to, transform, into, the, opposite, quality, for, example, grain, that, reaches, its, full, height, in, summer, fully, yang, will, produce, seeds, and, die, back, in, winter, fully, yin, in, an, endless, cycle, it, is, impossible, to, talk, about, yin, or, yang, without, some, reference, to, the, opposite, traditionally, it, is, said, that, yin, and, yang, are, known, by, the, comparison, of, each, other, since, yin, and, yang, are, bound, together, as, parts, of, a, mutual, whole, for, example, there, cannot, be, the, bottom, of, the, foot, without, the, top, a, way, to, illustrate, this, idea, is, to, postulate, the, notion, of, a, race, with, only, women, or, only, men, this, race, would, disappear, in, a, single, generation, yet, women, and, men, together, create, new, generations, that, allow, the, race, they, mutually, create, and, mutually, come, from, to, survive, the, interaction, of, the, two, heaven, and, earth, gives, birth, to, human, and, therefore, the, ten, thousand, things, yin, and, yang, transform, each, other, like, an, undertow, in, the, ocean, every, advance, is, complemented, by, a, retreat, and, every, rise, transforms, into, a, fall, thus, a, seed, will, sprout, from, the, earth, and, grow, upwards, towards, the, sky, an, intrinsically, yang, movement, then, when, it, reaches, its, full, potential, height, it, will, fall, the, growth, of, the, top, seeks, light, while, roots, grow, in, darkness, the, cycles, of, the, seasons, and, of, plants, that, progresses, or, entropies, depending, on, the, season, in, summer, it, seeks, to, procure, healthier, leaves, whittling, entropy, of, the, plant, is, in, autumn, the, degrown, plants, destruction, is, in, winter, growth, creating, of, the, plant, or, tree, during, spring, where, it, s, gaining, or, progressing, fully, progressed, occurs, during, summer, summer, seeks, stability, as, it, seeks, to, keep, progress, the, leaves, and, branches, that, are, healthy, growth, and, progress, reaching, its, end, point, of, a, cycle, creation, as, part, of, yang, and, destruction, as, part, of, yin, progress, on, one, side, yang, and, entropy, on, the, other, side, yin, is, represented, in, the, cycles, yin, is, the, black, side, and, yang, is, the, white, side, other, color, arrangements, have, included, the, white, of, yang, being, replaced, by, red, the, taijitu, is, sometimes, accompanied, by, other, shapes, such, as, bagua, the, relationship, between, yin, and, yang, is, often, described, in, terms, of, sunlight, playing, over, a, mountain, and, a, valley, yin, literally, the, shady, place, or, north, slope, is, the, dark, area, occluded, by, the, mountain, s, bulk, while, yang, literally, the, sunny, place, or, south, slope, is, the, brightly, lit, portion, as, the, sun, moves, across, the, sky, yin, and, yang, gradually, trade, places, with, each, other, revealing, what, was, obscured, and, obscuring, what, was, revealed, in, turn, the, concepts, are, also, applied, to, the, human, body, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, one, s, health, is, directly, related, to, the, balance, between, yin, and, yang, qualities, within, them, the, technology, of, yin, and, yang, is, the, foundation, of, critical, and, deductive, reasoning, for, effective, differential, diagnosis, of, disease, and, illnesses, within, taoist, influenced, traditional, chinese, medicine, in, the, i, ching, originally, a, divination, manual, of, the, western, zhou, period, c, 1000, 750, bc, based, on, chinese, astronomy, yin, and, yang, are, represented, by, broken, and, solid, lines, yin, is, broken, and, yang, is, solid, these, are, then, combined, into, trigrams, which, are, more, yang, e, g, or, more, yin, e, g, depending, on, the, number, of, broken, and, solid, lines, e, g, is, fully, yang, while, is, fully, yin, and, trigrams, are, combined, into, hexagrams, e, g, and, the, relative, positions, and, numbers, of, yin, and, yang, lines, within, the, trigrams, determines, the, meaning, of, a, trigram, and, in, hexagrams, the, upper, trigram, is, considered, yang, with, respect, to, the, lower, trigram, yin, which, allows, for, complex, depictions, of, interrelations, the, principle, of, yin, and, yang, is, represented, by, the, taijitu, literally, diagram, of, the, supreme, ultimate, the, term, is, commonly, used, to, mean, the, simple, divided, circle, form, but, may, refer, to, any, of, several, schematic, diagrams, representing, these, principles, such, as, the, swastika, common, to, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, similar, symbols, have, also, appeared, in, other, cultures, such, as, in, celtic, art, and, roman, shield, markings, in, this, symbol, the, two, teardrops, swirl, to, represent, the, conversion, of, yin, to, yang, and, yang, to, yin, this, is, seen, when, a, ball, is, thrown, into, the, air, with, a, yang, velocity, then, converts, to, a, yin, velocity, to, fall, back, to, earth, the, two, teardrops, are, opposite, in, direction, to, each, other, to, show, that, as, one, increases, the, other, decreases, the, dot, of, the, opposite, field, in, the, tear, drop, shows, that, there, is, always, yin, within, yang, and, always, yang, within, yin, tai, chi, a, form, of, martial, art, is, often, described, as, the, principles, of, yin, and, yang, applied, to, the, human, body, and, an, animal, body, wu, jianquan, a, famous, chinese, martial, arts, teacher, described, tai, chi, taijiquan, as, follows, various, people, have, offered, different, explanations, for, the, name, taijiquan, some, have, said, in, terms, of, self, cultivation, one, must, train, from, a, state, of, movement, towards, a, state, of, stillness, taiji, comes, about, through, the, balance, of, yin, and, yang, in, terms, of, the, art, of, attack, and, defense, then, in, the, context, of, the, changes, of, full, and, empty, one, is, constantly, internally, latent, to, not, outwardly, expressive, as, if, the, yin, and, yang, of, taiji, have, not, yet, divided, apart, others, say, every, movement, of, taijiquan, is, based, on, circles, just, like, the, shape, of, a, taijitu, therefore, it, is, called, taijiquan
