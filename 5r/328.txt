b, c, d, f, g, h, i, k, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, u, w, egyptian, mythology, is, the, collection, of, myths, from, ancient, egypt, which, describe, the, actions, of, the, egyptian, gods, as, a, means, of, understanding, the, world, around, them, the, beliefs, that, these, myths, express, are, an, important, part, of, ancient, egyptian, religion, myths, appear, frequently, in, egyptian, writings, and, art, particularly, in, short, stories, and, in, religious, material, such, as, hymns, ritual, texts, funerary, texts, and, temple, decoration, these, sources, rarely, contain, a, complete, account, of, a, myth, and, often, describe, only, brief, fragments, inspired, by, the, cycles, of, nature, the, egyptians, saw, time, in, the, present, as, a, series, of, recurring, patterns, whereas, the, earliest, periods, of, time, were, linear, myths, are, set, in, these, earliest, times, and, myth, sets, the, pattern, for, the, cycles, of, the, present, present, events, repeat, the, events, of, myth, and, in, doing, so, renew, maat, the, fundamental, order, of, the, universe, amongst, the, most, important, episodes, from, the, mythic, past, are, the, creation, myths, in, which, the, gods, form, the, universe, out, of, primordial, chaos, the, stories, of, the, reign, of, the, sun, god, ra, upon, the, earth, and, the, osiris, myth, concerning, the, struggles, of, the, gods, osiris, isis, and, horus, against, the, disruptive, god, set, events, from, the, present, that, might, be, regarded, as, myths, include, ra, s, daily, journey, through, the, world, and, its, otherworldly, counterpart, the, duat, recurring, themes, in, these, mythic, episodes, include, the, conflict, between, the, upholders, of, maat, and, the, forces, of, disorder, the, importance, of, the, pharaoh, in, maintaining, maat, and, the, continual, death, and, regeneration, of, the, gods, the, details, of, these, sacred, events, differ, greatly, from, one, text, to, another, and, often, seem, contradictory, egyptian, myths, are, primarily, metaphorical, translating, the, essence, and, behavior, of, deities, into, terms, that, humans, can, understand, each, variant, of, a, myth, represents, a, different, symbolic, perspective, enriching, the, egyptians, understanding, of, the, gods, and, the, world, mythology, profoundly, influenced, egyptian, culture, it, inspired, or, influenced, many, religious, rituals, and, provided, the, ideological, basis, for, kingship, scenes, and, symbols, from, myth, appeared, in, art, in, tombs, temples, and, amulets, in, literature, myths, or, elements, of, them, were, used, in, stories, that, range, from, humor, to, allegory, demonstrating, that, the, egyptians, adapted, mythology, to, serve, a, wide, variety, of, purposes, the, development, of, egyptian, myth, is, difficult, to, trace, egyptologists, must, make, educated, guesses, about, its, earliest, phases, based, on, written, sources, that, appeared, much, later, one, obvious, influence, on, myth, is, the, egyptians, natural, surroundings, each, day, the, sun, rose, and, set, bringing, light, to, the, land, and, regulating, human, activity, each, year, the, nile, flooded, renewing, the, fertility, of, the, soil, and, allowing, the, highly, productive, farming, that, sustained, egyptian, civilization, thus, the, egyptians, saw, water, and, the, sun, as, symbols, of, life, and, thought, of, time, as, a, series, of, natural, cycles, this, orderly, pattern, was, at, constant, risk, of, disruption, unusually, low, floods, resulted, in, famine, and, high, floods, destroyed, crops, and, buildings, the, hospitable, nile, valley, was, surrounded, by, harsh, desert, populated, by, peoples, the, egyptians, regarded, as, uncivilized, enemies, of, order, for, these, reasons, the, egyptians, saw, their, land, as, an, isolated, place, of, stability, or, maat, surrounded, and, endangered, by, chaos, these, themes, order, chaos, and, renewal, appear, repeatedly, in, egyptian, religious, thought, another, possible, source, for, mythology, is, ritual, many, rituals, make, reference, to, myths, and, are, sometimes, based, directly, on, them, but, it, is, difficult, to, determine, whether, a, culture, s, myths, developed, before, rituals, or, vice, versa, questions, about, this, relationship, between, myth, and, ritual, have, spawned, much, discussion, among, egyptologists, and, scholars, of, comparative, religion, in, general, in, ancient, egypt, the, earliest, evidence, of, religious, practices, predates, written, myths, rituals, early, in, egyptian, history, included, only, a, few, motifs, from, myth, for, these, reasons, some, scholars, have, argued, that, in, egypt, rituals, emerged, before, myths, but, because, the, early, evidence, is, so, sparse, the, question, may, never, be, resolved, for, certain, in, private, rituals, which, are, often, called, magical, the, myth, and, the, ritual, are, particularly, closely, tied, many, of, the, myth, like, stories, that, appear, in, the, rituals, texts, are, not, found, in, other, sources, even, the, widespread, motif, of, the, goddess, isis, rescuing, her, poisoned, son, horus, appears, only, in, this, type, of, text, the, egyptologist, david, frankfurter, argues, that, these, rituals, adapt, basic, mythic, traditions, to, fit, the, specific, ritual, creating, elaborate, new, stories, called, historiolas, based, on, myth, in, contrast, j, f, borghouts, says, of, magical, texts, that, there, is, not, a, shred, of, evidence, that, a, specific, kind, of, unorthodox, mythology, was, coined, for, this, genre, much, of, egyptian, mythology, consists, of, origin, myths, explaining, the, beginnings, of, various, elements, of, the, world, including, human, institutions, and, natural, phenomena, kingship, arises, among, the, gods, at, the, beginning, of, time, and, later, passed, to, the, human, pharaohs, warfare, originates, when, humans, begin, fighting, each, other, after, the, sun, god, s, withdrawal, into, the, sky, myths, also, describe, the, supposed, beginnings, of, less, fundamental, traditions, in, a, minor, mythic, episode, horus, becomes, angry, with, his, mother, isis, and, cuts, off, her, head, isis, replaces, her, lost, head, with, that, of, a, cow, this, event, explains, why, isis, was, sometimes, depicted, with, the, horns, of, a, cow, as, part, of, her, headdress, some, myths, may, have, been, inspired, by, historical, events, the, unification, of, egypt, under, the, pharaohs, at, the, end, of, the, predynastic, period, around, 3100, bc, made, the, king, the, focus, of, egyptian, religion, and, thus, the, ideology, of, kingship, became, an, important, part, of, mythology, in, the, wake, of, unification, gods, that, were, once, local, patron, deities, gained, national, importance, forming, new, relationships, that, linked, the, local, deities, into, a, unified, national, tradition, geraldine, pinch, suggests, that, early, myths, may, have, formed, from, these, relationships, egyptian, sources, link, the, mythical, strife, between, the, gods, horus, and, set, with, a, conflict, between, the, regions, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, which, may, have, happened, in, the, late, predynastic, era, or, in, the, early, dynastic, period, after, these, early, times, most, changes, to, mythology, developed, and, adapted, preexisting, concepts, rather, than, creating, new, ones, although, there, were, exceptions, many, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, myth, of, the, sun, god, withdrawing, into, the, sky, leaving, humans, to, fight, among, themselves, was, inspired, by, the, breakdown, of, royal, authority, and, national, unity, at, the, end, of, the, old, kingdom, c, 2686, bc, 2181, bc, in, the, new, kingdom, c, 1550, 1070, bc, minor, myths, developed, around, deities, like, yam, and, anat, who, had, been, adopted, from, canaanite, religion, in, contrast, during, the, greek, and, roman, eras, 332, bc, 641, ad, greco, roman, culture, had, little, influence, on, egyptian, mythology, scholars, have, difficulty, defining, which, ancient, egyptian, beliefs, are, myths, the, basic, definition, of, myth, suggested, by, the, egyptologist, john, baines, is, a, sacred, or, culturally, central, narrative, in, egypt, the, narratives, that, are, central, to, culture, and, religion, are, almost, entirely, about, events, among, the, gods, actual, narratives, about, the, gods, actions, are, rare, in, egyptian, texts, particularly, from, early, periods, and, most, references, to, such, events, are, mere, mentions, or, allusions, some, egyptologists, like, baines, argue, that, narratives, complete, enough, to, be, called, myths, existed, in, all, periods, but, that, egyptian, tradition, did, not, favor, writing, them, down, others, like, jan, assmann, have, said, that, true, myths, were, rare, in, egypt, and, may, only, have, emerged, partway, through, its, history, developing, out, of, the, fragments, of, narration, that, appear, in, the, earliest, writings, recently, however, vincent, arieh, tobin, and, susanne, bickel, have, suggested, that, lengthy, narration, was, not, needed, in, egyptian, mythology, because, of, its, complex, and, flexible, nature, tobin, argues, that, narrative, is, even, alien, to, myth, because, narratives, tend, to, form, a, simple, and, fixed, perspective, on, the, events, they, describe, if, narration, is, not, needed, for, myth, any, statement, that, conveys, an, idea, about, the, nature, or, actions, of, a, god, can, be, called, mythic, like, myths, in, many, other, cultures, egyptian, myths, serve, to, justify, human, traditions, and, to, address, fundamental, questions, about, the, world, such, as, the, nature, of, disorder, and, the, ultimate, fate, of, the, universe, the, egyptians, explained, these, profound, issues, through, statements, about, the, gods, egyptian, deities, represent, natural, phenomena, from, physical, objects, like, the, earth, or, the, sun, to, abstract, forces, like, knowledge, and, creativity, the, actions, and, interactions, of, the, gods, the, egyptians, believed, govern, the, behavior, of, all, of, these, forces, and, elements, for, the, most, part, the, egyptians, did, not, describe, these, mysterious, processes, in, explicit, theological, writings, instead, the, relationships, and, interactions, of, the, gods, illustrated, such, processes, implicitly, most, of, egypt, s, gods, including, many, of, the, major, ones, do, not, have, significant, roles, in, any, mythic, narratives, although, their, nature, and, relationships, with, other, deities, are, often, established, in, lists, or, bare, statements, without, narration, for, the, gods, who, are, deeply, involved, in, narratives, mythic, events, are, very, important, expressions, of, their, roles, in, the, cosmos, therefore, if, only, narratives, are, myths, mythology, is, a, major, element, in, egyptian, religious, understanding, but, not, as, essential, as, it, is, in, many, other, cultures, the, true, realm, of, the, gods, is, mysterious, and, inaccessible, to, humans, mythological, stories, use, symbolism, to, make, the, events, in, this, realm, comprehensible, not, every, detail, of, a, mythic, account, has, symbolic, significance, some, images, and, incidents, even, in, religious, texts, are, meant, simply, as, visual, or, dramatic, embellishments, of, broader, more, meaningful, myths, few, complete, stories, appear, in, egyptian, mythological, sources, these, sources, often, contain, nothing, more, than, allusions, to, the, events, to, which, they, relate, and, texts, that, contain, actual, narratives, tell, only, portions, of, a, larger, story, thus, for, any, given, myth, the, egyptians, may, have, had, only, the, general, outlines, of, a, story, from, which, fragments, describing, particular, incidents, were, drawn, moreover, the, gods, are, not, well, defined, characters, and, the, motivations, for, their, sometimes, inconsistent, actions, are, rarely, given, egyptian, myths, are, not, therefore, fully, developed, tales, their, importance, lay, in, their, underlying, meaning, not, their, characteristics, as, stories, instead, of, coalescing, into, lengthy, fixed, narratives, they, remained, highly, flexible, and, non, dogmatic, so, flexible, were, egyptian, myths, that, they, could, seemingly, conflict, with, each, other, many, descriptions, of, the, creation, of, the, world, and, the, movements, of, the, sun, occur, in, egyptian, texts, some, very, different, from, each, other, the, relationships, between, gods, were, fluid, so, that, for, instance, the, goddess, hathor, could, be, called, the, mother, wife, or, daughter, of, the, sun, god, ra, separate, deities, could, even, be, syncretized, or, linked, as, a, single, being, thus, the, creator, god, atum, was, combined, with, ra, to, form, ra, atum, one, commonly, suggested, reason, for, inconsistencies, in, myth, is, that, religious, ideas, differed, over, time, and, in, different, regions, the, local, cults, of, various, deities, developed, theologies, centered, on, their, own, patron, gods, as, the, influence, of, different, cults, shifted, some, mythological, systems, attained, national, dominance, in, the, old, kingdom, c, 2686, 2181, bc, the, most, important, of, these, systems, was, the, cults, of, ra, and, atum, centered, at, heliopolis, they, formed, a, mythical, family, the, ennead, that, was, said, to, have, created, the, world, it, included, the, most, important, deities, of, the, time, but, gave, primacy, to, atum, and, ra, the, egyptians, also, overlaid, old, religious, ideas, with, new, ones, for, instance, the, god, ptah, whose, cult, was, centered, at, memphis, was, also, said, to, be, the, creator, of, the, world, ptah, s, creation, myth, incorporates, older, myths, by, saying, that, it, is, the, ennead, who, carry, out, ptah, s, creative, commands, thus, the, myth, makes, ptah, older, and, greater, than, the, ennead, many, scholars, have, seen, this, myth, as, a, political, attempt, to, assert, the, superiority, of, memphis, god, over, those, of, heliopolis, by, combining, concepts, in, this, way, the, egyptians, produced, an, immensely, complicated, set, of, deities, and, myths, egyptologists, in, the, early, twentieth, century, thought, that, politically, motivated, changes, like, these, were, the, principal, reason, for, the, contradictory, imagery, in, egyptian, myth, however, in, the, 1940s, henri, frankfort, realizing, the, symbolic, nature, of, egyptian, mythology, argued, that, apparently, contradictory, ideas, are, part, of, the, multiplicity, of, approaches, that, the, egyptians, used, to, understand, the, divine, realm, frankfort, s, arguments, are, the, basis, for, much, of, the, more, recent, analysis, of, egyptian, beliefs, political, changes, affected, egyptian, beliefs, but, the, ideas, that, emerged, through, those, changes, also, have, deeper, meaning, multiple, versions, of, the, same, myth, express, different, aspects, of, the, same, phenomenon, different, gods, that, behave, in, a, similar, way, reflect, the, close, connections, between, natural, forces, the, varying, symbols, of, egyptian, mythology, express, ideas, too, complex, to, be, seen, through, a, single, lens, the, sources, that, are, available, range, from, solemn, hymns, to, entertaining, stories, without, a, single, canonical, version, of, any, myth, the, egyptians, adapted, the, broad, traditions, of, myth, to, fit, the, varied, purposes, of, their, writings, most, egyptians, were, illiterate, and, may, therefore, have, had, an, elaborate, oral, tradition, that, transmitted, myths, through, spoken, storytelling, susanne, bickel, suggests, that, the, existence, of, this, tradition, helps, explain, why, many, texts, related, to, myth, give, little, detail, the, myths, were, already, known, to, every, egyptian, very, little, evidence, of, this, oral, tradition, has, survived, and, modern, knowledge, of, egyptian, myths, is, drawn, from, written, and, pictorial, sources, only, a, small, proportion, of, these, sources, has, survived, to, the, present, so, much, of, the, mythological, information, that, was, once, written, down, has, been, lost, this, information, is, not, equally, abundant, in, all, periods, so, the, beliefs, that, egyptians, held, in, some, eras, of, their, history, are, more, poorly, understood, than, the, beliefs, in, better, documented, times, many, gods, appear, in, artwork, from, the, early, dynastic, period, of, egypt, s, history, c, 3100, 2686, bc, but, little, about, the, gods, actions, can, be, gleaned, from, these, sources, because, they, include, minimal, writing, the, egyptians, began, using, writing, more, extensively, in, the, old, kingdom, in, which, appeared, the, first, major, source, of, egyptian, mythology, the, pyramid, texts, these, texts, are, a, collection, of, several, hundred, incantations, inscribed, in, the, interiors, of, pyramids, beginning, in, the, 24th, century, bc, they, were, the, first, egyptian, funerary, texts, intended, to, ensure, that, the, kings, buried, in, the, pyramid, would, pass, safely, through, the, afterlife, many, of, the, incantations, allude, to, myths, related, to, the, afterlife, including, creation, myths, and, the, myth, of, osiris, many, of, the, texts, are, likely, much, older, than, their, first, known, written, copies, and, they, therefore, provide, clues, about, the, early, stages, of, egyptian, religious, belief, during, the, first, intermediate, period, c, 2181, 2055, bc, the, pyramid, texts, developed, into, the, coffin, texts, which, contain, similar, material, and, were, available, to, non, royals, succeeding, funerary, texts, like, the, book, of, the, dead, in, the, new, kingdom, and, the, books, of, breathing, from, the, late, period, 664, 323, bc, and, after, developed, out, of, these, earlier, collections, the, new, kingdom, also, saw, the, development, of, another, type, of, funerary, text, containing, detailed, and, cohesive, descriptions, of, the, nocturnal, journey, of, the, sun, god, texts, of, this, type, include, the, amduat, the, book, of, gates, and, the, book, of, caverns, temples, whose, surviving, remains, date, mostly, from, the, new, kingdom, and, later, are, another, important, source, of, myth, many, temples, had, a, per, ankh, or, temple, library, storing, papyri, for, rituals, and, other, uses, some, of, these, papyri, contain, hymns, which, in, praising, a, god, for, its, actions, often, refer, to, the, myths, that, define, those, actions, other, temple, papyri, describe, rituals, many, of, which, are, based, partly, on, myth, scattered, remnants, of, these, papyrus, collections, have, survived, to, the, present, it, is, possible, that, the, collections, included, more, systematic, records, of, myths, but, no, evidence, of, such, texts, has, survived, mythological, texts, and, illustrations, similar, to, those, on, temple, papyri, also, appear, in, the, decoration, of, the, temple, buildings, the, elaborately, decorated, and, well, preserved, temples, of, the, ptolemaic, and, roman, periods, 305, bc, ad, 380, are, an, especially, rich, source, of, myth, the, egyptians, also, performed, rituals, for, personal, goals, such, as, protection, from, or, healing, of, illness, these, rituals, are, often, called, magical, rather, than, religious, but, they, were, believed, to, work, on, the, same, principles, as, temple, ceremonies, evoking, mythical, events, as, the, basis, for, the, ritual, information, from, religious, sources, is, limited, by, a, system, of, traditional, restrictions, on, what, they, could, describe, and, depict, the, murder, of, the, god, osiris, for, instance, is, never, explicitly, described, in, egyptian, writings, the, egyptians, believed, that, words, and, images, could, affect, reality, so, they, avoided, the, risk, of, making, such, negative, events, real, the, conventions, of, egyptian, art, were, also, poorly, suited, for, portraying, whole, narratives, so, most, myth, related, artwork, consists, of, sparse, individual, scenes, references, to, myth, also, appear, in, non, religious, egyptian, literature, beginning, in, the, middle, kingdom, many, of, these, references, are, mere, allusions, to, mythic, motifs, but, several, stories, are, based, entirely, on, mythic, narratives, these, more, direct, renderings, of, myth, are, particularly, common, in, the, late, and, greco, roman, periods, when, according, to, scholars, such, as, heike, sternberg, egyptian, myths, reached, their, most, fully, developed, state, the, attitudes, toward, myth, in, nonreligious, egyptian, texts, vary, greatly, some, stories, resemble, the, narratives, from, magical, texts, while, others, are, more, clearly, meant, as, entertainment, and, even, contain, humorous, episodes, a, final, source, of, egyptian, myth, is, the, writings, of, greek, and, roman, writers, like, herodotus, and, diodorus, siculus, who, described, egyptian, religion, in, the, last, centuries, of, its, existence, prominent, among, these, writers, is, plutarch, whose, work, de, iside, et, osiride, contains, among, other, things, the, longest, ancient, account, of, the, myth, of, osiris, these, authors, knowledge, of, egyptian, religion, was, limited, because, they, were, excluded, from, many, religious, practices, and, their, statements, about, egyptian, beliefs, are, affected, by, their, biases, about, egypt, s, culture, egyptian, cosmology, is, analogous, to, ancient, near, eastern, cosmology, early, greek, cosmology, and, other, cosmological, systems, which, may, be, collectively, labelled, as, adhering, to, a, cradle, cosmology, model, insofar, as, they, share, a, cluster, of, common, features, including, a, flat, earth, surfaced, by, a, solid, firmament, a, primordial, watery, chaos, a, cosmic, center, a, rotating, sky, above, the, earth, an, ocean, located, at, and, surrounding, the, edges, of, the, earth, the, study, of, egyptian, cosmology, is, however, done, within, certain, limitations, there, are, no, systematic, accounts, of, creation, from, ancient, egyptian, literature, and, so, cosmological, views, are, pieced, together, from, a, variety, of, brief, references, across, different, texts, as, well, as, some, pictorial, evidence, a, second, issue, is, that, views, of, egyptian, cosmology, evolved, over, the, long, span, of, egypt, s, history, and, different, regions, also, had, different, cosmological, systems, while, there, is, always, one, self, generated, creator, god, that, emerges, from, the, eternal, watery, darkness, nun, for, example, the, creator, god, in, different, times, and, places, had, been, identified, separately, as, ptah, ra, amun, atum, or, khnum, the, egyptian, word, written, m3, t, often, rendered, maat, or, ma, at, refers, to, the, fundamental, order, of, the, universe, in, egyptian, belief, established, at, the, creation, of, the, world, maat, distinguishes, the, world, from, the, chaos, that, preceded, and, surrounds, it, maat, encompasses, both, the, proper, behavior, of, humans, and, the, normal, functioning, of, the, forces, of, nature, both, of, which, make, life, and, happiness, possible, because, the, actions, of, the, gods, govern, natural, forces, and, myths, express, those, actions, egyptian, mythology, represents, the, proper, functioning, of, the, world, and, the, sustenance, of, life, itself, to, the, egyptians, the, most, important, human, maintainer, of, maat, is, the, pharaoh, in, myth, the, pharaoh, is, the, son, of, a, variety, of, deities, as, such, he, is, their, designated, representative, obligated, to, maintain, order, in, human, society, just, as, they, do, in, nature, and, to, continue, the, rituals, that, sustain, them, and, their, activities, in, egyptian, belief, there, already, existed, an, infinite, and, chaotic, primordial, ocean, that, preceded, the, creation, of, the, ordered, world, this, cosmic, ocean, was, personified, by, the, god, nun, the, earth, personified, by, the, god, geb, is, flat, and, is, also, covered, by, a, flat, sky, firmament, heaven, that, arches, over, it, and, separates, the, earth, from, the, surrounding, cosmic, ocean, heaven, for, the, egyptians, was, usually, represented, nut, the, goddess, of, the, sky, earth, is, also, separated, from, the, firmament, by, the, atmosphere, personified, as, the, god, shu, therefore, the, egyptians, conceived, of, the, inhabited, world, as, a, bubble, of, air, finite, and, dry, surrounded, by, a, universal, and, infinite, dark, formless, and, inert, ocean, the, sun, god, ra, is, said, to, travel, through, the, sky, across, the, body, of, nut, enlivening, the, world, with, his, light, at, night, ra, passes, beyond, the, western, horizon, into, the, duat, a, mysterious, region, that, borders, the, formlessness, of, nun, at, dawn, he, emerges, from, the, duat, in, the, eastern, horizon, the, nature, of, the, sky, and, the, location, of, the, duat, are, uncertain, egyptian, texts, variously, describe, the, nighttime, sun, as, traveling, beneath, the, earth, and, within, the, body, of, nut, the, egyptologist, james, p, allen, believes, that, these, explanations, of, the, sun, s, movements, are, dissimilar, but, coexisting, ideas, in, allen, s, view, nut, represents, the, visible, surface, of, the, waters, of, nun, with, the, stars, floating, on, this, surface, the, sun, therefore, sails, across, the, water, in, a, circle, each, night, passing, beyond, the, horizon, to, reach, the, skies, that, arch, beneath, the, inverted, land, of, the, duat, leonard, h, lesko, however, believes, that, the, egyptians, saw, the, sky, as, a, solid, canopy, and, described, the, sun, as, traveling, through, the, duat, above, the, surface, of, the, sky, from, west, to, east, during, the, night, joanne, conman, modifying, lesko, s, model, argues, that, this, solid, sky, is, a, moving, concave, dome, overarching, a, deeply, convex, earth, the, sun, and, the, stars, move, along, with, this, dome, and, their, passage, below, the, horizon, is, simply, their, movement, over, areas, of, the, earth, that, the, egyptians, could, not, see, these, regions, would, then, be, the, duat, the, fertile, lands, of, the, nile, valley, upper, egypt, and, delta, lower, egypt, lie, at, the, center, of, the, world, in, egyptian, cosmology, outside, them, are, the, infertile, deserts, which, are, associated, with, the, chaos, that, lies, beyond, the, world, somewhere, beyond, them, is, the, horizon, the, akhet, there, two, mountains, in, the, east, and, the, west, mark, the, places, where, the, sun, enters, and, exits, the, duat, foreign, nations, are, associated, with, the, hostile, deserts, in, egyptian, ideology, foreign, people, likewise, are, generally, lumped, in, with, the, nine, bows, people, who, threaten, pharaonic, rule, and, the, stability, of, maat, although, peoples, allied, with, or, subject, to, egypt, may, be, viewed, more, positively, for, these, reasons, events, in, egyptian, mythology, rarely, take, place, in, foreign, lands, while, some, stories, pertain, to, the, sky, or, the, duat, egypt, itself, is, usually, the, scene, for, the, actions, of, the, gods, often, even, the, myths, set, in, egypt, seem, to, take, place, on, a, plane, of, existence, separate, from, that, inhabited, by, living, humans, although, in, other, stories, humans, and, gods, interact, in, either, case, the, egyptian, gods, are, deeply, tied, to, their, home, land, the, egyptians, vision, of, time, was, influenced, by, their, environment, each, day, the, sun, rose, and, set, bringing, light, to, the, land, and, regulating, human, activity, each, year, the, nile, flooded, renewing, the, fertility, of, the, soil, and, allowing, the, highly, productive, agriculture, that, sustained, egyptian, civilization, these, periodic, events, inspired, the, egyptians, to, see, all, of, time, as, a, series, of, recurring, patterns, regulated, by, maat, renewing, the, gods, and, the, universe, although, the, egyptians, recognized, that, different, historical, eras, differ, in, their, particulars, mythic, patterns, dominate, the, egyptian, perception, of, history, many, egyptian, stories, about, the, gods, are, characterized, as, having, taken, place, in, a, primeval, time, when, the, gods, were, manifest, on, the, earth, and, ruled, over, it, after, this, time, the, egyptians, believed, authority, on, earth, passed, to, human, pharaohs, this, primeval, era, seems, to, predate, the, start, of, the, sun, s, journey, and, the, recurring, patterns, of, the, present, world, at, the, other, end, of, time, is, the, end, of, the, cycles, and, the, dissolution, of, the, world, because, these, distant, periods, lend, themselves, to, linear, narrative, better, than, the, cycles, of, the, present, john, baines, sees, them, as, the, only, periods, in, which, true, myths, take, place, yet, to, some, extent, the, cyclical, aspect, of, time, was, present, in, the, mythic, past, as, well, egyptians, saw, even, stories, that, were, set, in, that, time, as, being, perpetually, true, the, myths, were, made, real, every, time, the, events, to, which, they, were, related, occurred, these, events, were, celebrated, with, rituals, which, often, evoked, myths, ritual, allowed, time, to, periodically, return, to, the, mythic, past, and, renew, life, in, the, universe, some, of, the, most, important, categories, of, myths, are, described, below, because, of, the, fragmentary, nature, of, egyptian, myths, there, is, little, indication, in, egyptian, sources, of, a, chronological, sequence, of, mythical, events, nevertheless, the, categories, are, arranged, in, a, very, loose, chronological, order, among, the, most, important, myths, were, those, describing, the, creation, of, the, world, the, egyptians, developed, many, accounts, of, the, creation, which, differ, greatly, in, the, events, they, describe, in, particular, the, deities, credited, with, creating, the, world, vary, in, each, account, this, difference, partly, reflects, the, desire, of, egypt, s, cities, and, priesthoods, to, exalt, their, own, patron, gods, by, attributing, creation, to, them, yet, the, differing, accounts, were, not, regarded, as, contradictory, instead, the, egyptians, saw, the, creation, process, as, having, many, aspects, and, involving, many, divine, forces, one, common, feature, of, the, myths, is, the, emergence, of, the, world, from, the, waters, of, chaos, that, surround, it, this, event, represents, the, establishment, of, maat, and, the, origin, of, life, one, fragmentary, tradition, centers, on, the, eight, gods, of, the, ogdoad, who, represent, the, characteristics, of, the, primeval, water, itself, their, actions, give, rise, to, the, sun, represented, in, creation, myths, by, various, gods, especially, ra, whose, birth, forms, a, space, of, light, and, dryness, within, the, dark, water, the, sun, rises, from, the, first, mound, of, dry, land, another, common, motif, in, the, creation, myths, which, was, likely, inspired, by, the, sight, of, mounds, of, earth, emerging, as, the, nile, flood, receded, with, the, emergence, of, the, sun, god, the, establisher, of, maat, the, world, has, its, first, ruler, accounts, from, the, first, millennium, bc, focus, on, the, actions, of, the, creator, god, in, subduing, the, forces, of, chaos, that, threaten, the, newly, ordered, world, atum, a, god, closely, connected, with, the, sun, and, the, primeval, mound, is, the, focus, of, a, creation, myth, dating, back, at, least, to, the, old, kingdom, atum, who, incorporates, all, the, elements, of, the, world, exists, within, the, waters, as, a, potential, being, at, the, time, of, creation, he, emerges, to, produce, other, gods, resulting, in, a, set, of, nine, deities, the, ennead, which, includes, geb, nut, and, other, key, elements, of, the, world, the, ennead, can, by, extension, stand, for, all, the, gods, so, its, creation, represents, the, differentiation, of, atum, s, unified, potential, being, into, the, multiplicity, of, elements, present, within, the, world, over, time, the, egyptians, developed, more, abstract, perspectives, on, the, creation, process, by, the, time, of, the, coffin, texts, they, described, the, formation, of, the, world, as, the, realization, of, a, concept, first, developed, within, the, mind, of, the, creator, god, the, force, of, heka, or, magic, which, links, things, in, the, divine, realm, and, things, in, the, physical, world, is, the, power, that, links, the, creator, s, original, concept, with, its, physical, realization, heka, itself, can, be, personified, as, a, god, but, this, intellectual, process, of, creation, is, not, associated, with, that, god, alone, an, inscription, from, the, third, intermediate, period, c, 1070, 664, bc, whose, text, may, be, much, older, describes, the, process, in, detail, and, attributes, it, to, the, god, ptah, whose, close, association, with, craftsmen, makes, him, a, suitable, deity, to, give, a, physical, form, to, the, original, creative, vision, hymns, from, the, new, kingdom, describe, the, god, amun, a, mysterious, power, that, lies, behind, even, the, other, gods, as, the, ultimate, source, of, this, creative, vision, the, origin, of, humans, is, not, a, major, feature, of, egyptian, creation, stories, in, some, texts, the, first, humans, spring, from, tears, that, ra, atum, or, his, feminine, aspect, the, eye, of, ra, sheds, in, a, moment, of, weakness, and, distress, foreshadowing, humans, flawed, nature, and, sorrowful, lives, others, say, humans, are, molded, from, clay, by, the, god, khnum, but, overall, the, focus, of, the, creation, myths, is, the, establishment, of, cosmic, order, rather, than, the, special, place, of, humans, within, it, in, the, period, of, the, mythic, past, after, the, creation, ra, dwells, on, earth, as, king, of, the, gods, and, of, humans, this, period, is, the, closest, thing, to, a, golden, age, in, egyptian, tradition, the, period, of, stability, that, the, egyptians, constantly, sought, to, evoke, and, imitate, yet, the, stories, about, ra, s, reign, focus, on, conflicts, between, him, and, forces, that, disrupt, his, rule, reflecting, the, king, s, role, in, egyptian, ideology, as, enforcer, of, maat, in, an, episode, known, in, different, versions, from, temple, texts, some, of, the, gods, defy, ra, s, authority, and, he, destroys, them, with, the, help, and, advice, of, other, gods, like, thoth, and, horus, the, elder, at, one, point, he, faces, dissent, even, from, an, extension, of, himself, the, eye, of, ra, which, can, act, independently, of, him, in, the, form, of, a, goddess, the, eye, goddess, becomes, angry, with, ra, and, runs, away, from, him, wandering, wild, and, dangerous, in, the, lands, outside, egypt, usually, nubia, weakened, by, her, absence, ra, sends, one, of, the, other, gods, shu, thoth, or, anhur, in, different, accounts, to, retrieve, her, by, force, or, persuasion, because, the, eye, of, ra, is, associated, with, the, star, sothis, whose, heliacal, rising, signaled, the, start, of, the, nile, flood, the, return, of, the, eye, goddess, to, egypt, coincides, with, the, life, giving, inundation, upon, her, return, the, goddess, becomes, the, consort, of, ra, or, of, the, god, who, has, retrieved, her, her, pacification, restores, order, and, renews, life, as, ra, grows, older, and, weaker, humanity, too, turns, against, him, in, an, episode, often, called, the, destruction, of, mankind, related, in, the, book, of, the, heavenly, cow, ra, discovers, that, humanity, is, plotting, rebellion, against, him, and, sends, his, eye, to, punish, them, she, slays, many, people, but, ra, apparently, decides, that, he, does, not, want, her, to, destroy, all, of, humanity, he, has, beer, dyed, red, to, resemble, blood, and, spreads, it, over, the, field, the, eye, goddess, drinks, the, beer, becomes, drunk, and, ceases, her, rampage, ra, then, withdraws, into, the, sky, weary, of, ruling, on, earth, and, begins, his, daily, journey, through, the, heavens, and, the, duat, the, surviving, humans, are, dismayed, and, they, attack, the, people, among, them, who, plotted, against, ra, this, event, is, the, origin, of, warfare, death, and, humans, constant, struggle, to, protect, maat, from, the, destructive, actions, of, other, people, in, the, book, of, the, heavenly, cow, the, results, of, the, destruction, of, mankind, seem, to, mark, the, end, of, the, direct, reign, of, the, gods, and, of, the, linear, time, of, myth, the, beginning, of, ra, s, journey, is, the, beginning, of, the, cyclical, time, of, the, present, yet, in, other, sources, mythic, time, continues, after, this, change, egyptian, accounts, give, sequences, of, divine, rulers, who, take, the, place, of, the, sun, god, as, king, on, earth, each, reigning, for, many, thousands, of, years, although, accounts, differ, as, to, which, gods, reigned, and, in, what, order, the, succession, from, ra, atum, to, his, descendants, shu, and, geb, in, which, the, kingship, passes, to, the, male, in, each, generation, of, the, ennead, is, common, both, of, them, face, revolts, that, parallel, those, in, the, reign, of, the, sun, god, but, the, revolt, that, receives, the, most, attention, in, egyptian, sources, is, the, one, in, the, reign, of, geb, s, heir, osiris, the, collection, of, episodes, surrounding, osiris, death, and, succession, is, the, most, elaborate, of, all, egyptian, myths, and, it, had, the, most, widespread, influence, in, egyptian, culture, in, the, first, portion, of, the, myth, osiris, who, is, associated, with, both, fertility, and, kingship, is, killed, and, his, position, usurped, by, his, brother, set, in, some, versions, of, the, myth, osiris, is, actually, dismembered, and, the, pieces, of, his, corpse, scattered, across, egypt, osiris, sister, and, wife, isis, finds, her, husband, s, body, and, restores, it, to, wholeness, she, is, assisted, by, funerary, deities, such, as, nephthys, and, anubis, and, the, process, of, osiris, restoration, reflects, egyptian, traditions, of, embalming, and, burial, isis, then, briefly, revives, osiris, to, conceive, an, heir, with, him, the, god, horus, the, next, portion, of, the, myth, concerns, horus, birth, and, childhood, isis, gives, birth, to, and, raises, her, son, in, secluded, places, hidden, from, the, menace, of, set, the, episodes, in, this, phase, of, the, myth, concern, isis, efforts, to, protect, her, son, from, set, or, other, hostile, beings, or, to, heal, him, from, sickness, or, injury, in, these, episodes, isis, is, the, epitome, of, maternal, devotion, and, a, powerful, practitioner, of, healing, magic, in, the, third, phase, of, the, story, horus, competes, with, set, for, the, kingship, their, struggle, encompasses, a, great, number, of, separate, episodes, and, ranges, in, character, from, violent, conflict, to, a, legal, judgment, by, the, assembled, gods, in, one, important, episode, set, tears, out, one, or, both, of, horus, eyes, which, are, later, restored, by, the, healing, efforts, of, thoth, or, hathor, for, this, reason, the, eye, of, horus, is, a, prominent, symbol, of, life, and, well, being, in, egyptian, iconography, because, horus, is, a, sky, god, with, one, eye, equated, with, the, sun, and, the, other, with, the, moon, the, destruction, and, restoration, of, the, single, eye, explains, why, the, moon, is, less, bright, than, the, sun, texts, present, two, different, resolutions, for, the, divine, contest, one, in, which, egypt, is, divided, between, the, two, claimants, and, another, in, which, horus, becomes, sole, ruler, in, the, latter, version, the, ascension, of, horus, osiris, rightful, heir, symbolizes, the, reestablishment, of, maat, after, the, unrighteous, rule, of, set, with, order, restored, horus, can, perform, the, funerary, rites, for, his, father, that, are, his, duty, as, son, and, heir, through, this, service, osiris, is, given, new, life, in, the, duat, whose, ruler, he, becomes, the, relationship, between, osiris, as, king, of, the, dead, and, horus, as, king, of, the, living, stands, for, the, relationship, between, every, king, and, his, deceased, predecessors, osiris, meanwhile, represents, the, regeneration, of, life, on, earth, he, is, credited, with, the, annual, growth, of, crops, and, in, the, duat, he, is, involved, in, the, rebirth, of, the, sun, and, of, deceased, human, souls, although, horus, to, some, extent, represents, any, living, pharaoh, he, is, not, the, end, of, the, lineage, of, ruling, gods, he, is, succeeded, first, by, gods, and, then, by, spirits, that, represent, dim, memories, of, egypt, s, predynastic, rulers, the, souls, of, nekhen, and, pe, they, link, the, entirely, mythical, rulers, to, the, final, part, of, the, sequence, the, lineage, of, egypt, s, historical, kings, several, disparate, egyptian, texts, address, a, similar, theme, the, birth, of, a, divinely, fathered, child, who, is, heir, to, the, kingship, the, earliest, known, appearance, of, such, a, story, does, not, appear, to, be, a, myth, but, an, entertaining, folktale, found, in, the, middle, kingdom, westcar, papyrus, about, the, birth, of, the, first, three, kings, of, egypt, s, fifth, dynasty, in, that, story, the, three, kings, are, the, offspring, of, ra, and, a, human, woman, the, same, theme, appears, in, a, firmly, religious, context, in, the, new, kingdom, when, the, rulers, hatshepsut, amenhotep, iii, and, ramesses, ii, depicted, in, temple, reliefs, their, own, conception, and, birth, in, which, the, god, amun, is, the, father, and, the, historical, queen, the, mother, by, stating, that, the, king, originated, among, the, gods, and, was, deliberately, created, by, the, most, important, god, of, the, period, the, story, gives, a, mythical, background, to, the, king, s, coronation, which, appears, alongside, the, birth, story, the, divine, connection, legitimizes, the, king, s, rule, and, provides, a, rationale, for, his, role, as, intercessor, between, gods, and, humans, similar, scenes, appear, in, many, post, new, kingdom, temples, but, this, time, the, events, they, depict, involve, the, gods, alone, in, this, period, most, temples, were, dedicated, to, a, mythical, family, of, deities, usually, a, father, mother, and, son, in, these, versions, of, the, story, the, birth, is, that, of, the, son, in, each, triad, each, of, these, child, gods, is, the, heir, to, the, throne, who, will, restore, stability, to, the, country, this, shift, in, focus, from, the, human, king, to, the, gods, who, are, associated, with, him, reflects, a, decline, in, the, status, of, the, pharaoh, in, the, late, stages, of, egyptian, history, ra, s, movements, through, the, sky, and, the, duat, are, not, fully, narrated, in, egyptian, sources, although, funerary, texts, like, the, amduat, book, of, gates, and, book, of, caverns, relate, the, nighttime, half, of, the, journey, in, sequences, of, vignettes, this, journey, is, key, to, ra, s, nature, and, to, the, sustenance, of, all, life, in, traveling, across, the, sky, ra, brings, light, to, the, earth, sustaining, all, things, that, live, there, he, reaches, the, peak, of, his, strength, at, noon, and, then, ages, and, weakens, as, he, moves, toward, sunset, in, the, evening, ra, takes, the, form, of, atum, the, creator, god, oldest, of, all, things, in, the, world, according, to, early, egyptian, texts, at, the, end, of, the, day, he, spits, out, all, the, other, deities, whom, he, devoured, at, sunrise, here, they, represent, the, stars, and, the, story, explains, why, the, stars, are, visible, at, night, and, seemingly, absent, during, the, day, at, sunset, ra, passes, through, the, akhet, the, horizon, in, the, west, at, times, the, horizon, is, described, as, a, gate, or, door, that, leads, to, the, duat, at, others, the, sky, goddess, nut, is, said, to, swallow, the, sun, god, so, that, his, journey, through, the, duat, is, likened, to, a, journey, through, her, body, in, funerary, texts, the, duat, and, the, deities, in, it, are, portrayed, in, elaborate, detailed, and, widely, varying, imagery, these, images, are, symbolic, of, the, awesome, and, enigmatic, nature, of, the, duat, where, both, the, gods, and, the, dead, are, renewed, by, contact, with, the, original, powers, of, creation, indeed, although, egyptian, texts, avoid, saying, it, explicitly, ra, s, entry, into, the, duat, is, seen, as, his, death, certain, themes, appear, repeatedly, in, depictions, of, the, journey, ra, overcomes, numerous, obstacles, in, his, course, representative, of, the, effort, necessary, to, maintain, maat, the, greatest, challenge, is, the, opposition, of, apep, a, serpent, god, who, represents, the, destructive, aspect, of, disorder, and, who, threatens, to, destroy, the, sun, god, and, plunge, creation, into, chaos, in, many, of, the, texts, ra, overcomes, these, obstacles, with, the, assistance, of, other, deities, who, travel, with, him, they, stand, for, various, powers, that, are, necessary, to, uphold, ra, s, authority, in, his, passage, ra, also, brings, light, to, the, duat, enlivening, the, blessed, dead, who, dwell, there, in, contrast, his, enemies, people, who, have, undermined, maat, are, tormented, and, thrown, into, dark, pits, or, lakes, of, fire, the, key, event, in, the, journey, is, the, meeting, of, ra, and, osiris, in, the, new, kingdom, this, event, developed, into, a, complex, symbol, of, the, egyptian, conception, of, life, and, time, osiris, relegated, to, the, duat, is, like, a, mummified, body, within, its, tomb, ra, endlessly, moving, is, like, the, ba, or, soul, of, a, deceased, human, which, may, travel, during, the, day, but, must, return, to, its, body, each, night, when, ra, and, osiris, meet, they, merge, into, a, single, being, their, pairing, reflects, the, egyptian, vision, of, time, as, a, continuous, repeating, pattern, with, one, member, osiris, being, always, static, and, the, other, ra, living, in, a, constant, cycle, once, he, has, united, with, osiris, regenerative, power, ra, continues, on, his, journey, with, renewed, vitality, this, renewal, makes, possible, ra, s, emergence, at, dawn, which, is, seen, as, the, rebirth, of, the, sun, expressed, by, a, metaphor, in, which, nut, gives, birth, to, ra, after, she, has, swallowed, him, and, the, repetition, of, the, first, sunrise, at, the, moment, of, creation, at, this, moment, the, rising, sun, god, swallows, the, stars, once, more, absorbing, their, power, in, this, revitalized, state, ra, is, depicted, as, a, child, or, as, the, scarab, beetle, god, khepri, both, of, which, represent, rebirth, in, egyptian, iconography, egyptian, texts, typically, treat, the, dissolution, of, the, world, as, a, possibility, to, be, avoided, and, for, that, reason, they, do, not, often, describe, it, in, detail, however, many, texts, allude, to, the, idea, that, the, world, after, countless, cycles, of, renewal, is, destined, to, end, this, end, is, described, in, a, passage, in, the, coffin, texts, and, a, more, explicit, one, in, the, book, of, the, dead, in, which, atum, says, that, he, will, one, day, dissolve, the, ordered, world, and, return, to, his, primeval, inert, state, within, the, waters, of, chaos, all, things, other, than, the, creator, will, cease, to, exist, except, osiris, who, will, survive, along, with, him, details, about, this, eschatological, prospect, are, left, unclear, including, the, fate, of, the, dead, who, are, associated, with, osiris, yet, with, the, creator, god, and, the, god, of, renewal, together, in, the, waters, that, gave, rise, to, the, orderly, world, there, is, the, potential, for, a, new, creation, to, arise, in, the, same, manner, as, the, old, because, the, egyptians, rarely, described, theological, ideas, explicitly, the, implicit, ideas, of, mythology, formed, much, of, the, basis, for, egyptian, religion, the, purpose, of, egyptian, religion, was, the, maintenance, of, maat, and, the, concepts, that, myths, express, were, believed, to, be, essential, to, maat, the, rituals, of, egyptian, religion, were, meant, to, make, the, mythic, events, and, the, concepts, they, represented, real, once, more, thereby, renewing, maat, the, rituals, were, believed, to, achieve, this, effect, through, the, force, of, heka, the, same, connection, between, the, physical, and, divine, realms, that, enabled, the, original, creation, for, this, reason, egyptian, rituals, often, included, actions, that, symbolized, mythical, events, temple, rites, included, the, destruction, of, models, representing, malign, gods, like, set, or, apophis, private, magical, spells, called, upon, isis, to, heal, the, sick, as, she, did, for, horus, and, funerary, rites, such, as, the, opening, of, the, mouth, ceremony, and, ritual, offerings, to, the, dead, evoked, the, myth, of, osiris, resurrection, yet, rituals, rarely, if, ever, involved, dramatic, reenactments, of, myths, there, are, borderline, cases, like, a, ceremony, alluding, to, the, osiris, myth, in, which, two, women, took, on, the, roles, of, isis, and, nephthys, but, scholars, disagree, about, whether, these, performances, formed, sequences, of, events, much, of, egyptian, ritual, was, focused, on, more, basic, activities, like, giving, offerings, to, the, gods, with, mythic, themes, serving, as, ideological, background, rather, than, as, the, focus, of, a, rite, nevertheless, myth, and, ritual, strongly, influenced, each, other, myths, could, inspire, rituals, like, the, ceremony, with, isis, and, nephthys, and, rituals, that, did, not, originally, have, a, mythic, meaning, could, be, reinterpreted, as, having, one, as, in, the, case, of, offering, ceremonies, in, which, food, and, other, items, given, to, the, gods, or, the, dead, were, equated, with, the, eye, of, horus, kingship, was, a, key, element, of, egyptian, religion, through, the, king, s, role, as, link, between, humanity, and, the, gods, myths, explain, the, background, for, this, connection, between, royalty, and, divinity, the, myths, about, the, ennead, establish, the, king, as, heir, to, the, lineage, of, rulers, reaching, back, to, the, creator, the, myth, of, divine, birth, states, that, the, king, is, the, son, and, heir, of, a, god, and, the, myths, about, osiris, and, horus, emphasize, that, rightful, succession, to, the, throne, is, essential, to, the, maintenance, of, maat, thus, mythology, provided, the, rationale, for, the, very, nature, of, egyptian, government, illustrations, of, gods, and, mythical, events, appear, extensively, alongside, religious, writing, in, tombs, temples, and, funerary, texts, mythological, scenes, in, egyptian, artwork, are, rarely, placed, in, sequence, as, a, narrative, but, individual, scenes, particularly, depicting, the, resurrection, of, osiris, do, sometimes, appear, in, religious, artwork, allusions, to, myth, were, very, widespread, in, egyptian, art, and, architecture, in, temple, design, the, central, path, of, the, temple, axis, was, likened, to, the, sun, god, s, path, across, the, sky, and, the, sanctuary, at, the, end, of, the, path, represented, the, place, of, creation, from, which, he, rose, temple, decoration, was, filled, with, solar,
