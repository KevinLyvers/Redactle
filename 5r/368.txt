is, a, popular, hindu, deity, among, tamilians, in, tamil, nadu, as, well, among, the, tamil, diaspora, revered, by, the, sri, vaishnava, denomination, of, hinduism, perumal, is, venerated, in, popular, tradition, as, venkateshwara, at, tirupati, and, sri, ranganathaswamy, at, srirangam, vishnu, is, a, rigvedic, deity, but, not, a, prominent, one, when, compared, to, indra, agni, and, others, just, 5, out, of, 1028, hymns, of, the, rigveda, are, dedicated, to, vishnu, although, he, is, mentioned, in, other, hymns, vishnu, is, mentioned, in, the, brahmana, layer, of, text, in, the, vedas, thereafter, his, profile, rises, and, over, the, history, of, indian, scriptures, states, jan, gonda, vishnu, becomes, a, divinity, of, the, highest, rank, one, equivalent, to, the, supreme, being, though, a, minor, mention, and, with, overlapping, attributes, in, the, vedas, he, has, important, characteristics, in, various, hymns, of, the, rig, veda, such, as, 1, 154, 5, 1, 56, 3, and, 10, 15, 3, in, these, hymns, the, vedic, scriptures, assert, that, vishnu, resides, in, that, highest, home, where, departed, atman, self, reside, an, assertion, that, may, have, been, the, reason, for, his, increasing, emphasis, and, popularity, in, hindu, soteriology, he, is, also, described, in, the, vedic, literature, as, the, one, who, supports, heaven, and, earth, 5, might, i, reach, that, dear, cattle, pen, of, his, where, men, seeking, the, gods, find, elation, for, exactly, that, is, the, bond, to, the, wide, striding, one, the, wellspring, of, honey, in, the, highest, step, of, vi,

the, food, at, the, cry, of, svadh, they, are, the, most, welcome, arrivals, here, in, the, vedic, hymns, vishnu, is, invoked, alongside, other, deities, especially, indra, whom, he, helps, kill, the, symbol, of, evil, named, vritra, his, distinguishing, characteristic, in, the, vedas, is, his, association, with, light, two, rigvedic, hymns, in, mandala, 7, refer, to, vishnu, in, section, 7, 99, of, the, rigveda, vishnu, is, addressed, as, the, god, who, separates, heaven, and, earth, a, characteristic, he, shares, with, indra, in, the, vedic, texts, the, deity, or, god, referred, to, as, vishnu, is, surya, or, savitr, sun, god, who, also, bears, the, name, suryanarayana, again, this, link, to, surya, is, a, characteristic, vishnu, shares, with, fellow, vedic, deities, named, mitra, and, agni, wherein, in, different, hymns, they, too, bring, men, together, and, cause, all, living, beings, to, rise, up, and, impel, them, to, go, about, their, daily, activities, in, hymn, 7, 99, of, rigveda, indra, vishnu, is, equivalent, and, produce, the, sun, with, the, verses, asserting, that, this, sun, is, the, source, of, all, energy, and, light, for, all, in, other, hymns, of, the, rigveda, vishnu, is, a, close, friend, of, indra, elsewhere, in, rigveda, atharvaveda, and, upanishadic, texts, vishnu, is, equivalent, to, prajapati, both, are, described, as, the, protector, and, preparer, of, the, womb, and, according, to, klaus, klostermaier, this, may, be, the, root, behind, the, post, vedic, fusion, of, all, the, attributes, of, the, vedic, prajapati, unto, the, avatars, of, vishnu, in, the, yajurveda, taittiriya, aranyaka, 10, 13, 1, narayana, sukta, narayana, is, mentioned, as, the, supreme, being, the, first, verse, of, narayana, suktam, mentions, the, words,

1, 22, 20, also, mentions, the, same, paramam, padam, in, the, atharvaveda, the, mythology, of, a, boar, who, raises, goddess, earth, from, the, depths, of, cosmic, ocean, appears, but, without, the, word, vishnu, or, his, alternate, avatar, names, in, post, vedic, mythology, this, legend, becomes, one, of, the, basis, of, many, cosmogonic, myth, called, the, varaha, legend, with, varaha, as, an, avatar, of, vishnu, several, hymns, of, the, rigveda, repeat, the, mighty, deed, of, vishnu, called, the, trivikrama, which, is, one, of, the, lasting, mythologies, in, hinduism, since, the, vedic, times, it, is, an, inspiration, for, ancient, artwork, in, numerous, hindu, temples, such, as, at, the, ellora, caves, which, depict, the, trivikrama, legend, through, the, vamana, avatar, of, vishnu,

and, defeats, the, evil, symbolized, by, the, asuras, after, they, had, usurped, the, three, worlds, and, thus, vishnu, is, the, saviour, of, the, mortals, and, the, immortals, devas, to, what, is,

the, absolute, and, its, merging, into, the, absolute, which, is, unmistakably, advaitic, in, its, trend, in, the, same, passages, the, bhagavata, includes, a, mention, of, bhagavan, as, the, object, of, concentration, thereby, presenting, the, bhakti, path, from, the, three, major, paths, of, hindu, spirituality, discussed, in, the, bhagavad, gita, vaishnava, thought, holds, vishnu, to, exist,
