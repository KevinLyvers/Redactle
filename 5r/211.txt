and, evangelist, during, the, middle, of, the, 1st, century, c, ad, 42, due, to, disputes, concerning, the, nature, of, christ, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, were, in, schism, after, the, council, of, chalcedon, in, ad, 451, resulting, in, a, conflict, with, the, greek, orthodox, church, of, alexandria, after, ad, 639, egypt, was, ruled, by, its, islamic, conquerors, from, arabia, in, the, 12th, century, the, church, relocated, its, seat, from, alexandria, to, cairo, the, same, century, also, saw, the, copts, become, a, religious, minority, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, nubian, christianity, was, supplanted, by, islam, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, larger, body, of, ethnic, egyptian, christians, began, to, call, themselves, coptic, orthodox, to, distinguish, themselves, from, the, catholic, copts, and, from, the, eastern, orthodox, who, are, mostly, greek, in, 1959, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, was, granted, autocephaly, this, was, extended, to, the, eritrean, orthodox, tewahedo, church, in, 1998, following, the, successful, eritrean, war, of, independence, from, ethiopia, since, the, 2011, egyptian, revolution, coptic, christians, have, suffered, increased, religious, discrimination, and, violence, according, to, tradition, the, coptic, church, was, founded, by, mark, the, evangelist, c, ad, 42, and, regards, itself, as, the, subject, of, many, prophecies, in, the, old, testament, the, first, christians, in, egypt, were, common, people, who, spoke, egyptian, coptic, there, were, also, alexandrian, jewish, people, such, as, theophilus, the, same, name, addressed, in, the, introductory, chapter, of, the, gospel, of, luke, though, it, is, unclear, who, the, author, refers, to, the, coptic, language, is, a, universal, language, used, in, coptic, churches, in, every, country, it, descends, from, ancient, egyptian, and, uses, the, coptic, alphabet, a, script, descended, from, the, greek, alphabet, with, added, characters, derived, from, the, demotic, script, today, the, bohairic, dialect, of, coptic, is, used, primarily, for, liturgical, purposes, many, of, the, hymns, in, the, liturgy, are, in, coptic, and, have, been, passed, down, for, many, centuries, the, language, is, used, to, preserve, egypt, s, original, language, which, was, banned, by, the, arab, invaders, who, ordered, arabic, to, be, used, instead, however, most, copts, speak, arabic, the, official, language, of, egypt, hence, arabic, is, also, used, in, church, services, nowadays, the, service, books, though, written, in, coptic, have, the, arabic, text, in, parallel, columns, the, catechetical, school, of, alexandria, is, the, oldest, catechetical, school, in, the, world, jerome, records, that, the, christian, school, of, alexandria, was, founded, by, mark, himself, the, theological, college, of, the, catechetical, school, was, re, established, in, 1893, the, school, became, a, leading, center, of, the, allegorical, method, of, biblical, interpretation, espoused, a, rapprochement, between, greek, culture, and, christian, faith, and, attempted, to, assert, orthodox, christian, teachings, against, heterodox, views, in, an, era, of, doctrinal, flux, in, the, 4th, century, an, alexandrian, presbyter, named, arius, began, a, theological, dispute, about, the, nature, of, christ, that, spread, throughout, the, christian, world, and, is, now, known, as, arianism, the, ecumenical, council, of, nicea, ad, 325, was, convened, by, emperor, constantine, i, after, pope, alexander, i, of, alexandria, requested, to, hold, a, council, to, respond, to, heresies, under, the, presidency, of, hosius, of, cordova, to, resolve, the, dispute, this, eventually, led, to, the, formulation, of, the, symbol, of, faith, also, known, as, the, nicene, creed, in, the, year, ad, 381, pope, timothy, i, of, alexandria, presided, over, the, second, ecumenical, council, known, as, the, ecumenical, council, of, constantinople, to, judge, macedonius, who, denied, the, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, this, council, completed, the, nicene, creed, with, this, confirmation, of, the, divinity, of, the, holy, spirit, we, believe, in, the, holy, spirit, the, lord, the, giver, of, life, who, proceeds, from, the, father, who, with, the, father, and, the, son, is, worshiped, and, glorified, who, spoke, by, the, prophets, and, in, one, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, church, we, confess, one, baptism, for, the, remission, of, sins, and, we, look, for, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, and, the, life, of, the, coming, age, amen, another, theological, dispute, in, the, 5th, century, occurred, over, the, teachings, of, nestorius, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, who, taught, that, god, the, word, was, not, hypostatically, joined, with, human, nature, but, rather, dwelt, in, the, man, jesus, as, a, consequence, of, this, he, denied, the, title, mother, of, god, theotokos, to, the, virgin, mary, declaring, her, instead, to, be, mother, of, christ, christotokos, the, council, confirmed, the, teachings, of, athanasius, and, confirmed, the, title, of, mary, as, mother, of, god, it, also, clearly, stated, that, anyone, who, separated, christ, into, two, hypostases, was, anathema, as, cyril, had, said, that, there, is, one, nature, for, god, the, word, incarnate, mia, physis, tou, theou, logou, sesark, men, the, introduction, to, the, creed, is, formulated, as, follows, we, magnify, you, o, mother, of, the, true, light, and, we, glorify, you, o, saint, and, mother, of, god, theotokos, for, you, have, borne, unto, us, the, saviour, of, the, world, glory, to, you, o, our, master, and, king, christ, the, pride, of, the, apostles, the, crown, of, the, martyrs, the, rejoicing, of, the, righteous, firmness, of, the, churches, and, the, forgiveness, of, sins, we, proclaim, the, holy, trinity, in, one, godhead, we, worship, him, we, glorify, him, lord, have, mercy, lord, have, mercy, lord, bless, us, amen, the, church, of, alexandria, was, part, in, communion, with, the, rest, of, christendom, until, the, council, of, chalcedon, when, in, ad, 451, emperor, marcian, attempted, to, heal, divisions, in, the, church, the, response, of, pope, dioscorus, the, pope, of, alexandria, who, was, later, exiled, was, that, the, emperor, should, not, intervene, in, the, affairs, of, the, church, it, was, at, chalcedon, that, the, emperor, through, the, imperial, delegates, enforced, harsh, disciplinary, measures, against, pope, dioscorus, in, response, to, his, boldness, in, ad, 449, pope, dioscorus, headed, the, 2nd, council, of, ephesus, called, the, robber, council, by, chalcedonian, historians, it, held, to, the, miaphysite, formula, which, upheld, the, christology, of, one, incarnate, nature, of, god, the, word, greek, mia, physis, theou, logou, sesark, men, in, terms, of, christology, the, oriental, orthodox, non, chalcedonians, understanding, is, that, christ, is, one, nature, the, logos, incarnate, of, the, full, humanity, and, full, divinity, the, chalcedonians, understanding, is, that, christ, is, recognized, in, two, natures, full, humanity, and, full, divinity, oriental, orthodoxy, contends, that, such, a, formulation, is, no, different, from, what, the, nestorians, teach, from, that, point, onward, alexandria, would, have, two, patriarchs, the, non, chalcedonian, native, egyptian, one, now, known, as, the, coptic, pope, of, alexandria, and, patriarch, of, all, africa, on, the, holy, apostolic, see, of, st, mark, and, the, melkite, or, imperial, patriarch, now, known, as, the, greek, orthodox, patriarch, of, alexandria, almost, the, entire, egyptian, population, rejected, the, terms, of, the, council, of, chalcedon, and, remained, faithful, to, the, native, egyptian, church, now, known, as, the, coptic, orthodox, church, by, anathematizing, pope, leo, because, of, the, tone, and, content, of, his, tome, as, per, alexandrine, theology, perception, pope, dioscorus, was, found, guilty, of, doing, so, without, due, process, in, other, words, the, tome, of, leo, was, not, a, subject, of, heresy, in, the, first, place, but, it, was, a, question, of, questioning, the, reasons, behind, not, having, it, either, acknowledged, or, read, at, the, second, council, of, ephesus, in, ad, 449, pope, dioscorus, of, alexandria, was, never, labeled, as, a, heretic, by, the, council, s, canons, copts, also, believe, that, the, pope, of, alexandria, was, forcibly, prevented, from, attending, the, third, congregation, of, the, council, from, which, he, was, ousted, apparently, the, result, of, a, conspiracy, tailored, by, the, roman, delegates, before, the, current, positive, era, of, eastern, and, oriental, orthodox, dialogues, chalcedonians, sometimes, used, to, call, the, non, chalcedonians, monophysites, though, the, coptic, orthodox, church, in, reality, regards, monophysitism, as, a, heresy, the, chalcedonian, doctrine, in, turn, came, to, be, known, as, dyophysite, a, term, that, comes, closer, to, coptic, orthodoxy, is, miaphysite, which, refers, to, a, conjoined, nature, for, christ, both, human, and, divine, united, indivisibly, in, the, incarnate, logos, the, muslim, invasion, of, egypt, took, place, in, ad, 639, relying, on, eyewitness, testimony, bishop, john, of, nikiu, in, his, chronicle, provides, a, graphic, account, of, the, invasion, from, a, coptic, perspective, although, the, chronicle, has, only, been, preserved, in, an, ethiopic, ge, ez, text, some, scholars, believe, that, it, was, originally, written, in, coptic, john, s, account, is, critical, of, the, invaders, who, he, says, despoiled, the, egyptians, of, their, possessions, and, dealt, cruelly, with, them, and, he, details, the, atrocities, committed, by, the, muslims, against, the, native, population, during, the, conquest, and, when, with, great, toil, and, exertion, they, had, cast, down, the, walls, of, the, city, they, forthwith, made, themselves, masters, of, it, and, put, to, the, sword, thousands, of, its, inhabitants, and, of, the, soldiers, and, they, gained, an, enormous, booty, and, took, the, women, and, children, captive, and, divided, them, amongst, themselves, and, they, made, that, city, a, desolation, though, critical, of, the, muslim, commander, amr, ibn, al, as, who, during, the, campaign, he, says, had, no, mercy, on, the, egyptians, and, did, not, observe, the, covenant, they, had, made, with, him, for, he, was, of, a, barbaric, race, he, does, note, that, following, the, completion, of, the, conquest, amr, took, none, of, the, property, of, the, churches, and, he, committed, no, act, of, spoilation, or, plunder, and, he, preserved, them, throughout, all, his, days, despite, the, political, upheaval, the, egyptian, population, remained, mainly, christian, however, gradual, conversions, to, islam, over, the, centuries, had, changed, egypt, from, a, christian, to, a, largely, muslim, country, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, another, scholar, writes, that, a, combination, of, repression, of, coptic, revolts, arab, muslim, immigration, and, coptic, conversion, to, islam, resulted, in, the, demographic, decline, of, the, copts, egypt, s, umayyad, rulers, taxed, christians, at, a, higher, rate, than, muslims, driving, merchants, towards, islam, and, undermining, the, economic, base, of, the, coptic, church, although, the, coptic, church, did, not, disappear, the, umayyad, tax, policies, made, it, difficult, for, the, church, to, retain, the, egyptian, elites, in, 969, egypt, entered, the, fatimid, dynasty, in, egypt, from, 969, to, 1171, who, adopted, a, largely, favorable, attitude, toward, the, christians, the, major, exception, to, this, was, the, persecution, led, by, caliph, al, hakim, between, 1004, and, 1013, which, included, clothing, regulations, prohibition, of, publicly, celebrating, christian, festivals, and, dismissal, of, christian, and, jewish, functionaries, however, at, the, end, of, his, reign, al, hakim, rescinded, these, measures, allowing, the, copts, to, regain, privileged, positions, within, the, administration, the, coptic, patriarchal, residence, moved, from, alexandria, to, cairo, during, the, patriarchate, of, cyril, ii, 1078, 92, this, move, was, at, the, demand, of, the, grand, vizier, badr, al, jamali, who, insisted, that, the, pope, establish, himself, in, the, capital, when, saladin, entered, egypt, in, 1163, this, ushered, in, a, government, focused, on, defending, sunni, islam, christians, were, again, discriminated, against, and, meant, to, show, modesty, in, their, religious, ceremonies, and, buildings, during, the, ottoman, period, copts, were, classified, alongside, other, oriental, orthodox, and, nestorian, peoples, under, the, armenian, millet, in, 1798, the, french, invaded, egypt, unsuccessfully, and, the, british, helped, the, turks, to, regain, power, over, egypt, under, the, muhammad, ali, dynasty, the, position, of, copts, began, to, improve, early, in, the, 19th, century, under, the, stability, and, tolerance, of, the, muhammad, ali, dynasty, the, coptic, community, ceased, to, be, regarded, by, the, state, as, an, administrative, unit, in, 1855, the, jizya, tax, was, abolished, by, sa, id, pasha, shortly, thereafter, the, copts, started, to, serve, in, the, egyptian, army, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, coptic, church, underwent, phases, of, new, development, in, 1853, pope, cyril, iv, established, the, first, modern, coptic, schools, including, the, first, egyptian, school, for, girls, he, also, founded, a, printing, press, which, was, only, the, second, national, press, in, the, country, the, pope, established, very, friendly, relations, with, other, denominations, to, the, extent, that, when, the, greek, patriarch, in, egypt, had, to, absent, himself, from, the, country, for, a, long, period, of, time, he, left, his, church, under, the, guidance, of, the, coptic, patriarch, the, theological, college, of, the, school, of, alexandria, was, reestablished, in, 1893, it, began, its, new, history, with, five, students, one, of, whom, was, later, to, become, its, dean, today, it, has, campuses, in, alexandria, and, cairo, and, in, various, dioceses, throughout, egypt, as, well, as, outside, egypt, it, has, campuses, in, new, jersey, los, angeles, sydney, melbourne, and, london, where, potential, clergymen, and, other, qualified, men, and, women, study, many,

basilios, by, pope, cyril, vi, furthermore, the, eritrean, orthodox, tewahedo, church, similarly, became, independent, of, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, in, 1994, when, four, bishops, were, consecrated, by, pope, shenouda, iii, of, alexandria, to, form, the, basis, of, a, local, holy, synod, of, the, eritrean, church, in, 1998, the, eritrean, orthodox, tewahedo, church, gained,

orthodox, and, eastern, chalcedonian, orthodox, churches, have, been, meeting, in, a, bid, to, resolve, theological, differences, and, have, concluded, that, many, of, the, differences, are, caused, by, the, two, groups, using, different, terminology, to, describe, the, same, thing, in, the, summer, of, 2001, the, coptic, orthodox, and, greek, orthodox, patriarchates, of, alexandria, agreed, to,

transformation, writing, in, 2013, the, theologian, samuel, tadros, stated, today, s, coptic, church, as, an, institution, is, built, solely, on, his, vision, for, the, first, time, in, its, history, the, synod, codiefied, its, internal, laws, it, also, established, numerous, coptic, institutions, within, and, outside, of, egypt, shenouda, raised, the, number, of, bishops, from, 26, to, 117, and, ordained, hundreds, of, priests, which, greatly, reduced, the, influence, of, any, one, bishop, shenouda, also, instituted, a, yearly, meeting, of, the, synod, which, greatly, expanded, the, number, of, laws, governing, the, church, this, included, instituting, church, curriculums, for, the, education, of, new, priests, new, deacons, and, newly, weds, for, the, first, time, in, the, coptic,
