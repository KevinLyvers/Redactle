existed, before, the, source, of, the, darkness, will, dissolve, and, the, deficiency, will, be, taken, from, its, root, those, who, were, not, perfected, in, the, unconceived, one, will, receive, glories, in, their, realms, and, kingdoms, of, the, immortals, but, those, who, were, will, enter, a, kingless, realm, all, will, be, judged, according, to, their, deeds, and, gnosis, christian, eschatology, is, the, study, concerned, with, the, ultimate, destiny, of, the, individual, soul, and, of, the, entire, created, order, based, primarily, upon, biblical, texts, within, the, old, and, new, testaments, christian, eschatological, research, looks, to, study, and, discuss, matters, such, as, the, nature, of, the, divine, and, the, divine, nature, of, jesus, christ, death, and, the, afterlife, heaven, and, hell, the, second, coming, of, jesus, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, the, rapture, the, tribulation, millennialism, the, end, of, the, world, the, last, judgment, and, the, new, heaven, and, new, earth, in, the, world, to, come, eschatological, passages, occur, in, many, places, in, the, bible, in, both, the, old, and, the, new, testaments, in, the, old, testament, apocalyptic, eschatology, can, be, found, notably, in, isaiah, 24, 27, isaiah, 56, 66, joel, zechariah, 9, 14, as, well, as, in, the, closing, chapters, of, daniel, and, in, ezekiel, in, the, new, testament, applicable, passages, include, matthew, 24, mark, 13, the, parable, of, the, sheep, and, the, goats, and, the, book, of, revelation, revelation, often, occupies, a, central, place, in, christian, eschatology, the, second, coming, of, christ, is, the, central, event, in, christian, eschatology, within, the, broader, context, of, the, fullness, of, the, kingdom, of, god, most, christians, believe, that, death, and, suffering, will, continue, to, exist, until, christ, s, return, there, are, however, various, views, concerning, the, order, and, significance, of, other, eschatological, events, the, book, of, revelation, stands, at, the, core, of, much, of, christian, eschatology, the, study, of, revelation, is, usually, divided, into, four, interpretative, methodologies, or, hermeneutics, first, century, christians, believed, jesus, would, return, during, their, lifetime, when, the, converts, of, paul, in, thessalonica, were, persecuted, by, the, roman, empire, they, believed, the, end, of, days, to, be, imminent, most, of, the, scholars, participating, in, the, third, quest, hold, that, jesus, was, an, eschatological, prophet, who, believed, the, kingdom, of, god, was, coming, within, his, own, lifetime, or, within, the, lifetime, of, his, contemporaries, this, view, generally, known, as, consistent, eschatology, was, influential, during, the, early, to, the, mid, twentieth, century, and, continues, to, be, influential, today, in, proposed, portraits, of, the, historical, jesus, however, c, h, dodd, and, others, have, insisted, on, a, realized, eschatology, that, says, jesus, own, ministry, fulfilled, prophetic, hopes, many, conservative, scholars, have, adopted, the, paradoxical, position, the, kingdom, of, god, passages, describes, a, kingdom, that, is, both, present, and, still, to, come, claiming, pauline, eschatology, as, support, 208, 209, r, t, france, and, n, t, wright, among, others, have, taken, jesus, apocalyptic, statements, of, an, imminent, end, historically, as, referring, to, the, fall, of, jerusalem, and, the, destruction, of, the, temple, in, 70, ad, 143, 152, a, number, of, interpretations, of, the, term, kingdom, of, god, have, thus, appeared, in, its, eschatological, context, e, g, apocalyptic, realized, or, inaugurated, eschatologies, yet, no, consensus, has, emerged, among, scholars, while, some, who, believe, in, the, literal, interpretation, of, the, bible, insist, the, prediction, of, dates, or, times, is, futile, others, believe, jesus, foretold, signs, of, the, end, of, days, the, precise, time, however, will, come, like, a, thief, in, the, night, 1, thess, 5, 2, they, may, also, refer, to, matthew, 24, 36, in, which, jesus, is, quoted, as, saying, but, concerning, that, day, and, hour, no, one, knows, not, even, the, angels, of, heaven, nor, the, son, but, the, father, only, in, the, new, testament, jesus, refers, to, this, period, preceding, the, end, times, as, the, great, tribulation, matthew, 24, 21, affliction, mark, 13, 19, and, days, of, vengeance, luke, 21, 22, the, book, of, matthew, describes, the, devastation, when, ye, therefore, shall, see, the, abomination, of, desolation, spoken, of, by, daniel, the, prophet, stand, in, the, holy, place, whoso, readeth, let, him, understand, then, let, them, which, be, in, judaea, flee, into, the, mountains, let, him, which, is, on, the, housetop, not, come, down, neither, let, him, which, is, in, the, field, return, back, to, take, his, clothes, and, woe, unto, them, that, are, with, child, for, then, shall, be, great, tribulation, such, as, was, not, since, the, beginning, of, the, world, to, this, time, no, nor, ever, shall, be, and, except, those, days, should, be, shortened, there, should, no, flesh, be, saved, but, for, the, elect, s, sake, those, days, shall, be, shortened, the, resulting, chaos, will, affect, pregnancies, newborns, and, a, scourge, will, spread, throughout, the, flesh, save, for, the, elect, the, vivid, imagery, of, this, section, is, repeated, closely, in, mark, 13, 14, 20, the, gospel, of, luke, describes, a, complete, unraveling, of, the, social, fabric, with, widespread, calamity, and, war, then, he, said, to, them, nation, will, rise, against, nation, and, kingdom, against, kingdom, there, will, be, great, earthquakes, and, in, various, places, famines, and, pestilences, and, there, will, be, terrors, and, great, signs, from, heaven, but, before, all, this, they, will, lay, their, hands, on, you, and, persecute, you, delivering, you, up, to, the, synagogues, and, prisons, and, you, will, be, brought, before, kings, and, governors, for, my, name, s, sake, this, will, be, your, opportunity, to, bear, witness, settle, it, therefore, in, your, minds, not, to, meditate, beforehand, how, to, answer, for, i, will, give, you, a, mouth, and, wisdom, which, none, of, your, adversaries, will, be, able, to, withstand, or, contradict, you, will, be, delivered, up, even, by, parents, and, brothers, and, relatives, and, friends, and, some, of, you, they, will, put, to, death, you, will, be, hated, by, all, for, my, name, s, sake, but, not, a, hair, of, your, head, will, perish, by, your, endurance, you, will, gain, your, lives, but, when, you, see, jerusalem, surrounded, by, armies, then, know, that, its, desolation, has, come, near, then, let, those, who, are, in, judea, flee, to, the, mountains, and, let, those, who, are, inside, the, city, depart, and, let, not, those, who, are, out, in, the, country, enter, it, for, these, are, days, of, vengeance, to, fulfill, all, that, is, written, alas, for, women, who, are, pregnant, and, for, those, who, are, nursing, infants, in, those, days, for, there, will, be, great, distress, upon, the, earth, and, wrath, against, this, people, they, will, fall, by, the, edge, of, the, sword, and, be, led, captive, among, all, nations, and, jerusalem, will, be, trampled, underfoot, by, the, gentiles, until, the, times, of, the, gentiles, are, fulfilled, and, there, will, be, signs, in, sun, and, moon, and, stars, and, on, the, earth, distress, of, nations, in, perplexity, because, of, the, roaring, of, the, sea, and, the, waves, people, fainting, with, fear, and, with, foreboding, of, what, is, coming, on, the, world, for, the, powers, of, the, heavens, will, be, shaken, and, then, they, will, see, the, son, of, man, coming, in, a, cloud, with, power, and, great, glory, now, when, these, things, begin, to, take, place, straighten, up, and, raise, your, heads, because, your, redemption, is, drawing, near, and, he, told, them, a, parable, look, at, the, fig, tree, and, all, the, trees, as, soon, as, they, come, out, in, leaf, you, see, for, yourselves, and, know, that, the, summer, is, already, near, so, also, when, you, see, these, things, taking, place, you, know, that, the, kingdom, of, god, is, near, truly, i, say, to, you, this, generation, will, not, pass, away, until, all, has, taken, place, heaven, and, earth, will, pass, away, but, my, words, will, not, pass, away, in, the, book, of, revelation, the, great, tribulation,

amillennial, school, of, thought, promoted, by, augustine, of, hippo, in, his, work, the, city, of, god, contemporary, use, of, the, term, end, times, has, evolved, from, literal, belief, in, christian, millennialism, in, this, tradition, biblical, apocalypse, is, believed, to, be, imminent, with, various, current, events, as, omens, of, impending, armageddon, these, beliefs, have, been, put, forward, by, the, adventist, movement, millerites, and, dispensational, premillennialists, in, 1918, a, group, of, eight, well, known, preachers, produced, the, london, manifesto, warning, of, an, imminent, second, coming, of, christ, shortly, after, the, 1917, liberation, of, jerusalem, by, the, british, protestants, are, divided, between, millennialists, and, amillennialists, millennialists, concentrate, on, the, issue, of, whether, the, true, believers, will, see, the, great, tribulation, or, be, removed, from, it, by, what, is, referred, to, as, a, pre, tribulation, rapture, amillennialists, believe, the, end, times, encompass, the, time, from, christ, s, ascension, to, the, last, day, and, maintain, that, the, mention, of, the, thousand, years, in, the, book, of, revelation, is, meant, to, be, taken, metaphorically, i, e, not, literally, a, view, which, continues, to, cause, divisions, within, protestant, christianity, there, is, a, range, of, eschatological, belief, in, protestant, christianity, christian, premillennialists, who, believe, the, end, times, are, occurring, now, are, usually, specific, about, timelines, that, climax, in, the, end, of, the, world, for, some, israel, the, european, union, or, the, united, nations, are, seen, as, major, players, whose, roles, were, foretold, in, scripture, within, dispensational, premillennialist, writing, there, is, the, belief, that, christians, will, be, summoned, to, heaven, by, christ, at, the, rapture, occurring, before, a, great, tribulation, prophesied, in, matthew, 24, 25, mark, 13, and, luke, 21, the, tribulation, is, described, in, the, book, of, revelation, end, times, may, also, refer, to, the, passing, of, an, age, or, long, period, in, the, relationship, between, man, and, god, adherents, to, this, view, cite, the, second, epistle, to, timothy, and, draw, analogies, to, the, late, twentieth, and, early, twenty, first, centuries, post, exilic, hebrew, books, of, prophecy, such, as, daniel, and, ezekiel, are, given, new, interpretations, in, this, christian, tradition, while, apocalyptic, forecasts, appear, in, the, judeo, christian, sibylline, oracles, which, include, the, book, of, revelation, ascribed, to, john, the, apocryphal, apocalypse, of, peter, and, the, second, book, of, esdras, religious, movements, which, expect, that, the, second, coming, of, christ, will, be, a, cataclysmic, event, are, generally, called, adventism, these, have, arisen, throughout, the, christian, era, but, were, particularly, common, after, the, protestant, reformation, emanuel, swedenborg, considered, the, second, coming, to, be, symbolic, and, to, have, occurred, in, 1757, along, with, others, he, developed, a, religious, system, around, the, second, coming, of, christ, disclosed, by, new, prophecy, or, special, revelation, not, described, in, the, bible, the, millerites, are, diverse, religious, groups, which, similarly, rely, upon, a, special, gift, of, interpretation, for, predicting, the, second, coming, the, difference, between, the, 19th, century, millerite, and, adventist, movements, and, contemporary, prophecy, is, that, william, miller, and, his, followers, based, on, biblical, interpretation, predicted, the, time, of, the, second, coming, to, have, occurred, in, 1844, contemporary, writing, of, end, time, has, suggested, the, timetable, will, be, triggered, by, future, wars, and, moral, catastrophe, and, that, this, time, of, tribulation, is, close, at, hand, seventh, day, adventists, believe, biblical, prophecy, to, foretell, an, end, time, scenario, in, which, the, united, states, works, in, conjunction, with, the, catholic, church, to, mandate, worship, on, a, day, other, than, the, true, sabbath, saturday, as, prescribed, in, the, ten, commandments, exodus, 20, 8, 11, this, will, bring, about, a, situation, where, one, must, choose, for, or, against, the, bible, as, the, will, of, god, another, view, of, the, end, times, is, preterism, it, distinguishes, the, time, of, the, end, from, the, end, of, time, preterists, believe, the, term, last, days, or, time, of, the, end, refers, to, neither, the, last, days, of, the, earth, nor, the, last, days, of, humankind, but, the, end, of, the, old, covenant, between, god, and, israel, which, according, to, preterism, took, place, when, the, temple, in, jerusalem, was, destroyed, in, 70, ce, preterists, believe, that, prophecies, such, as, the, second, coming, the, desecration, of, the, jewish, temple, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, the, rise, of, the, antichrist, the, great, tribulation, the, advent, of, the, day, of, the, lord, and, a, final, judgment, had, been, fulfilled, when, the, romans, sacked, jerusalem, and, completely, destroyed, its, temple, proponents, of, full, preterism, do, not, believe, in, a, coming, resurrection, of, the, dead, they, place, this, event, as, well, as, the, second, coming, in, the, year, 70, advocates, of, partial, preterism, do, believe, in, a, coming, resurrection, full, preterists, contend, that, partial, preterists, are, merely, futurists, since, they, believe, the, second, coming, the, resurrection, the, rapture, and, the, judgment, are, yet, to, come, many, preterists, believe, first, century, christians, experienced, the, rapture, to, rejoin, the, christ, according, with, preterism, s, interpretation, of, end, times, many, time, passages, in, the, new, testament, foretell, a, second, coming, of, christ, with, last, days, to, take, place, within, the, lifetimes,

a, major, impetus, to, the, dispensationalist, belief, system, the, wars, of, israel, after, 1948, with, its, arab, neighbors, provided, further, support, according, to, john, f, walvoord, after, the, six, day, war, in, 1967, and, the, yom, kippur, war, in, 1973, it, seemed, plausible, to, many, fundamentalist, christians, in, the, 1970s, that, middle, east, turmoil, may, well, be, leading, up, to, the, fulfillment, of, various, bible, prophecies, and, to, the, battle, of, armageddon, members, of, the, dispensationalist, movement, such, as, hal, lindsey, j, dwight, pentecost, john, walvoord, all, of, whom, have, dallas, theological, seminary, backgrounds, and, some, other, writers, claimed, further, that, the, european, economic, community, which, preceded, the, european, union, would, become, a, united, states, of, europe, which, would, in, turn, become, a, revived, roman, empire, ruled, by, the, antichrist, the, revived, roman, empire, also, figured, into, the, new, testament, writers, vision, of, the, future, the, fact, that, in, the, early, 1970s, there, were, erroneously, thought, to, be, seven, nations, in, the, european, economic, community, was, held, to, be, significant, this, aligned, the, community, with, a, seven, headed, beast, mentioned, in, revelation, this, specific, prophecy, has, required, revision, but, the, idea, of, a, revived, roman, empire, remains, dispensationalism, in, contrast, to, the, millerite, adventist, movement, had, its, beginning, in, the, 19th, century, when, john, nelson, darby, founder, of, the, plymouth, brethren, religious, denomination, incorporated, into, his, system, of, biblical, interpretation, a, system, of, organizing, biblical, time, into, a, number, of, discrete, dispensations, each, of, which, marks, a, separate, covenant, with, god, darby, s, beliefs, were, widely, publicized, in, cyrus, i, scofield, s, scofield, reference, bible, an, annotated, bible, that, became, popular, in, the, united, states, since, the, majority, of, the, biblical, prophets, were, writing, at, a, time, when, the, temple, in, jerusalem, was, still, functioning, they, wrote, as, if, it, would, still, be, standing, during, the, prophesied, events, according, to, preterism, this, was, a, fulfillment, of, the, prophecies, however, according, to, futurists, their, destruction, in, ad, 70, put, the, prophetic, timetable, on, hold, many, such, believers, therefore, anticipated, the, return, of, jews, to, israel, and, the, reconstruction, of, the, temple, before, the, second, coming, could, occur, a, view, of, the, second, coming, of, christ, as, held, by, post, tribulational, pre, millennialists, holds, that, the, church, of, christ, will, have, to, undergo, great, persecution, by, being, present, during, the, great, tribulation, in, 1843, william, miller, made, the, first, of, several, predictions, that, the, world, would, end, in, only, a, few, months, as, his, predictions, did, not, come, true, referred, to, as, the, great, disappointment, followers, of, miller, went, on, to, found, separate, groups, the, most, successful, of, which, is, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, members, of, the, bah, faith, believe, miller, s, interpretation, of, signs, and, dates, of, the, coming, of, jesus, were, for, the, most, part, correct, they, believe, the, fulfillment, of, biblical, prophecies, of, the, coming, of, christ, came, through, a, forerunner, of, their, own, religion, the, b, b, according, to, the, b, b, s, words, 4, april, 1844, was, the, first, day, that, the, spirit, descended, into, his, heart, his, subsequent, declaration, to, mull, husayn, i, bushru, i, that, he, was, the, promised, one, an, event, now, commemorated, by, bah, s, as, a, major, holy, day, took, place, on, 23, may, 1844, it, was, in, october, of, that, year, that, the, b, b, embarked, on, a, pilgrimage, to, mecca, where, he, openly, declared, his, claims, to, the, sharif, of, mecca, the, first, news, coverage, of, these, events, in, the, west, was, in, 1845, by, the, times, followed, by, others, in, 1850, in, the, united, states, the, first, bah, to, come, to, america, was, in, 1892, several, bah, books, and, pamphlets, make, mention, of, the, millerites, the, prophecies, used, by, miller, and, the, great, disappointment, most, notably, william, sears, s, thief, in, the, night,

jehovah, s, witnesses, is, central, to, their, religious, beliefs, they, believe, jesus, christ, has, been, ruling, in, heaven, as, king, since, 1914, a, date, they, believe, was, prophesied, in, the, bible, and, that, after, that, time, a, period, of, cleansing, occurred, resulting, in, god, s, selection, of, the, bible, students, associated, with, charles, taze, russell, as, his, people, in, 1919, they, also, believe, that, the, destruction, of, those, who, reject, the, bible, s, message, and, thus, willfully, refuse, to, obey, god, will, shortly, take, place, at, armageddon, ensuring, that, the, beginning, of, the, new, earthly, society, will, be, composed, of, willing, subjects, of, that, kingdom, the, religion, s, doctrines, surrounding, 1914, are, the, legacy, of, a, series, of,

those, years, including, the, presence, of, jesus, christ, the, beginning, of, the, last, days, the, destruction, of, worldly, governments, and, the, earthly, resurrection, of, jewish, patriarchs, were, successively, abandoned, in, 1922, the, society, s, principal, magazine, the, watchtower, described, its, chronology, as, no, stronger, than, its, weakest, link, but, also, claimed, the, chronological, relationships, to, be, of, divine, origin, and, divinely, corroborated, in, a, class, by, itself, absolutely, and, unqualifiedly, correct, and, indisputable, facts, and, repudiation, of, russell, s, teachings, was, described, as, equivalent, to, a, repudiation, of, the, lord, the, watch, tower, society, has, acknowledged, its, early, leaders, promoted, incomplete, even, inaccurate, concepts, the, governing, body, of, jehovah, s, witnesses, says, that, unlike, old, testament, prophets, its, interpretations, of, the, bible, are, not, inspired, or, infallible, it, says, that, bible, prophecies, can, be, fully, understood, only, after, their, fulfillment, citing, examples, of, biblical, figures, who, did, not, understand, the, meaning, of, prophecies, they, received,

them, corresponding, approximately, to, the, year, 4300, since, he, was, born, in, 623, bce, at, this, time, knowledge, of, dharma, will, be, lost, as, well, the, last, of, his, relics, will, be, gathered, in, bodh, gaya, and, cremated, there, will, be, a, new, era, in, which, the, next, buddha, maitreya, will, appear, but, it, will, be, preceded, by, the, degeneration, of, human, society, this, will, be, a, period, of, greed, lust, poverty, ill, will, violence, murder, impiety, physical, weakness, sexual, depravity, and, societal, collapse, and, even, the, buddha, himself, will, be, forgotten, this, will, be, followed, by, the, coming, of, maitreya, when, the, teachings, of, dharma, are, forgotten, maitreya, was, the, first, bodhisattva, around, whom, a, cult, developed, in, approximately, the, third, century, ce, the, earliest, known, mention, of, maitreya, occurs, in, the, cakkavatti, or, sihanada, sutta, in, digha, nikaya, 26, of, the, pali, canon, in, it, gautama, buddha, predicted, his, teachings, of, dharma, would, be, forgotten, after, 5, 000, years, at, that, period, brethren, there, will, arise, in, the, world, an, exalted, one, named, maitreya, fully, awakened, abounding, in, wisdom, and, goodness, happy, with, knowledge, of, the, worlds, unsurpassed, as, a, guide, to, mortals, willing, to, be, led, a, teacher, for, gods, and, men, an, exalted, one, a, buddha, even, as, i, am, now, he, by, himself, will, thoroughly, know, and, see, as, it, were, face, to, face, this, universe, with, its, worlds, of, the, spirits, its, brahmas, and, its, maras, and, its, world, of, recluses, and, brahmins, of, princes, and, peoples, even, as, i, now, by, myself, thoroughly, know, and, see, them, the, text, then, foretells, the, birth, of, maitreya, buddha, in, the, city, of, ketumat, in, present, day, benares, whose, king, will, be, the, cakkavatt, sankha, sankha, will, live, in, the, former, palace, of, king, mah, panad, and, will, become, a, renunciate, who, follows, maitreya, in, mahayana, buddhism, maitreya, will, attain, bodhi, in, seven, days, the, minimum, period, by, virtue, of, his, many, lifetimes, of, preparation, once, buddha, he, will, rule, over, the, ketumati, pure, land, an, earthly, paradise, sometimes, associated, with, the, indian, city, of, varanasi, or, benares, in, present, day, uttar, pradesh, in, mahayana, buddhism, the, buddha, presides, over, a, land, of, purity, for, example, amitabha, presides, over, sukhavati, more, popularly, known, as, the, western, paradise, a, notable, teaching, he, will, rediscover, is, that, of, the, ten, non, virtuous, deeds, killing, stealing, sexual, misconduct, lying, divisive, speech, abusive, speech, idle, speech, covetousness, harmful, intent, and, wrong, views, the, ten, virtuous, deeds, will, replace, them, with, the, abandonment, of, each, of, these, practices, edward, conze, in, his, buddhist, scriptures, 1959, gives, an, account, of, maitreya, the, lord, replied, maitreya, the, best, of, men, will, then, leave, the, tu, ita, heavens, and, go, for, his, last, rebirth, as, soon, as, he, is, born, he, will, walk, seven, steps, forward, and, where, he, puts, down, his, feet, a, jewel, or, a, lotus, will, spring, up, he, will, raise, his, eyes, to, the, ten, directions, and, will, speak, these, words, this, is, my, last, birth, there, will, be, no, rebirth, after, this, one, never, will, i, come, back, here, but, all, pure, i, shall, win, nirvana, maitreya, currently, resides, in, tushita, but, will, come, to, jambudvipa, when, needed, most, as, successor, to, the, historic, kyamuni, buddha, maitreya, will, achieve, complete, enlightenment, during, his, lifetime, and, following, this, reawakening, he, will, bring, back, the, timeless, teaching, of, dharma, to, this, plane, and, rediscover, enlightenment, the, arya, maitreya, mandala, founded, in, 1933, by, lama, anagarika, govinda, is, based, on, the, idea, of, maitreya,

underground, criminal, organization, known, as, the, triads, which, exist, today, as, an, international, underground, criminal, network, note, that, no, description, of, maitreya, occurs, in, any, other, sutta, in, the, canon, casting, doubt, as, to, the, authenticity, of, the, scripture, in, addition, sermons, of, the, buddha, normally, are, in, response, to, a, question, or, in, a, specific, context, but, this, sutta, has, a, beginning, and, an, ending, and, its, content, is, quite, different, from, the, others, this, has, led, some, to, conclude, that, the, whole, sutta, is, apocryphal, or, tampered, with, in, his, sermon, of, the, seven, suns, in, the, pali, canon, the, buddha, describes, the, ultimate, fate, of, the, earth, in, an, apocalypse, characterized, by, the, consequent, appearance, of, seven, suns, in, the, sky, each, causing, progressive, ruin, until, the, planet, is, destroyed, all, things, are, impermanent, all, aspects, of, existence, are, unstable, and, non, eternal, beings, will, become, so, weary, and, disgusted, with, the, constituent, things, that, they, will, seek, emancipation, from, them, more, quickly, there, will, come, a, season, o, monks, when, after, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, rains, will, cease, all, seedlings, all, vegetation, all, plants, grasses, and, trees, will, dry, up, and, cease, to, be, there, comes, another, season, after, a, great, lapse, of, time, when, a, second, sun, will, appear, now, all, brooks, and, ponds, will, dry, up, vanish, cease, to, be, the, canon, goes, on, to, describe, the, progressive, destruction, of, each, sun, the, third, sun, will, dry, the, ganges, river, and, other, rivers, whilst, the, fourth, will, cause, the, lakes, to, evaporate, the, fifth, will, dry, the, oceans, later, again, after, a, vast, period, of, time, a, sixth, sun, will, appear, and, it, will, bake, the, earth, even, as, a, pot, is, baked, by, a, potter, all, the, mountains, will, reek, and, send, up, clouds, of, smoke, after, another, great, interval, a, seventh, sun, will, appear, and, the, earth, will, blaze, with, fire, until, it, becomes, one, mass, of, flame, the, mountains, will, be, consumed, a, spark, will, be, carried, on, the, wind, and, go, to, the, worlds, of, god, thus, monks, all, things, will, burn, perish, and, exist, no, more, except, those, who, have, seen, the, path,

his, father, by, ripping, fenrir, s, jaws, apart, and, stabbing, the, wolf, in, the, heart, with, his, spear, the, serpent, j, rmungandr, will, open, its, gaping, maw, and, be, met, in, combat, by, thor, thor, also, a, son, of, odin, will, defeat, the, serpent, only, to, take, nine, steps, afterwards, before, collapsing, in, his, own, death, after, this, people, will, flee, their, homes, as, the, sun, blackens, and, the, earth, sinks, into, the, sea, the, stars, will, vanish, steam, will, rise, and, flames, will, touch, the, heavens, this, conflict, will, result, in, the, deaths, of, most, of, the, major, gods, and, forces, of, chaos, finally, surtr, will, fling, fire, across, the, nine, worlds, the, ocean, will, then, completely, submerge, midgard, after, the, cataclysm, the, world, will, resurface, new, and, fertile, and, the, surviving, gods, will, meet, baldr, another, son, of, odin, will, be, reborn, in, the, new, world, according, to, v, lusp, the, two, human, survivors, l, f, and, l, f, rasir, will, then, repopulate, this, new, earth, egyptian, texts, typically, treat, the, dissolution, of, the, world, as, a, possibility, to, be, avoided, and, for, that, reason, they, do, not, often, describe, it, in, detail, however, many, texts, allude, to, the, idea, that, the, world, after, countless, cycles, of, renewal, is, destined, to, end, this, end, is, described, in, a, passage, in, the, coffin, texts, and, a, more, explicit, one, in, the, book, of, the, dead, in, which, atum, says, that, he, will, one, day, dissolve, the, ordered, world, and, return, to, his, primeval, inert, state, within, the, waters, of, chaos, all, things, other, than, the, creator, will, cease, to, exist, except, osiris, who, will, survive, along, with, him, details, about, this, eschathological, prospect, are, left, unclear, including, the, fate, of, the, dead, who, are, associated, with, osiris, yet, with, the, creator, god, and, the, god, of, renewal, together, in, the, waters, that, gave, rise, to, the, orderly, world, there, is, the, potential, for, a, new, creation, to, arise, in, the, same, manner, as, the, old, the, taoist, faith, is, not, concerned, with, what, came, before, or, after, life, knowing, only, their, own, being, in, the, tao, the, philosophy, is, that, people, come, and, go, just, like, mountains, trees, and, stars, but, tao, will, go, on, for, time, immemorial, researchers, in, futures, studies, and, transhumanists, investigate, how, the, accelerating, rate, of, scientific, progress, may, lead, to, a, technological, singularity, in, the, future, that, would, profoundly, and, unpredictably, change, the, course, of, human, history, and, result, in, homo, sapiens, no, longer, being, the, dominant, life, form, on, earth, occasionally, the, term, physical, eschatology, is, applied, to, the, long, term, predictions, of, astrophysics, about, the, future, of, earth, and, ultimate, fate, of, the, universe, in, approximately, 6, billion, years, the, sun, will, turn, into, a, red, giant, life, on, earth, will, become, impossible, due, to, a, rise, in, temperature, long, before, the, planet, is, possibly, actually, swallowed, up, by, the, sun, or, left, charred, later, the, sun, will, become, a, white, dwarf
