modern, philosophy, is, philosophy, developed, in, the, modern, era, and, associated, with, modernity, it, is, not, a, specific, doctrine, or, school, and, thus, should, not, be, confused, with, modernism, although, there, are, certain, assumptions, common, to, much, of, it, which, helps, to, distinguish, it, from, earlier, philosophy, the, 17th, and, early, 20th, centuries, roughly, mark, the, beginning, and, the, end, of, modern, philosophy, how, much, of, the, renaissance, should, be, included, is, a, matter, for, dispute, likewise, modernity, may, or, may, not, have, ended, in, the, twentieth, century, and, been, replaced, by, postmodernity, how, one, decides, these, questions, will, determine, the, scope, of, one, s, use, of, the, term, modern, philosophy, how, much, of, renaissance, intellectual, history, is, part, of, modern, philosophy, is, disputed, the, early, renaissance, is, often, considered, less, modern, and, more, medieval, compared, to, the, later, high, renaissance, later, by, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, major, figures, in, philosophy, of, mind, epistemology, and, metaphysics, were, roughly, divided, into, two, main, groups, the, rationalists, mostly, in, france, and, germany, argued, all, knowledge, must, begin, from, certain, innate, ideas, in, the, mind, major, rationalists, were, descartes, baruch, spinoza, gottfried, leibniz, and, nicolas, malebranche, the, empiricists, by, contrast, held, that, knowledge, must, begin, with, sensory, experience, major, figures, in, this, line, of, thought, are, john, locke, george, berkeley, and, david, hume, these, are, retrospective, categories, for, which, kant, is, largely, responsible, ethics, and, political, philosophy, are, usually, not, subsumed, under, these, categories, though, all, these, philosophers, worked, in, ethics, in, their, own, distinctive, styles, other, important, figures, in, political, philosophy, include, thomas, hobbes, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, immanuel, kant, set, forth, a, groundbreaking, philosophical, system, which, claimed, to, bring, unity, to, rationalism, and, empiricism, whether, or, not, he, was, right, he, did, not, entirely, succeed, in, ending, philosophical, dispute, kant, sparked, a, storm, of, philosophical, work, in, germany, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, beginning, with, german, idealism, the, characteristic, theme, of, idealism, was, that, the, world, and, the, mind, equally, must, be, understood, according, to, the, same, categories, it, culminated, in, the, work, of, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, who, among, many, other, things, said, in, the, preface, to, his, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, right, that, the, real, is, rational, the, rational, is, real, hegel, s, work, was, carried, in, many, directions, by, his, followers, and, critics, karl, marx, appropriated, both, hegel, s, philosophy, of, history, and, the, empirical, ethics, dominant, in, britain, transforming, hegel, s, ideas, into, a, strictly, materialist, form, setting, the, grounds, for, the, development, of, a, science, of, society, s, ren, kierkegaard, in, contrast, dismissed, all, systematic, philosophy, as, an, inadequate, guide, to, life, and, meaning, for, kierkegaard, life, is, meant, to, be, lived, not, a, mystery, to, be, solved, arthur, schopenhauer, took, idealism, to, the, conclusion, that, the, world, was, nothing, but, the, futile, endless, interplay, of, images, and, desires, and, advocated, atheism, and, pessimism, schopenhauer, s, ideas, were, taken, up, and, transformed, by, nietzsche, who, seized, upon, their, various, dismissals, of, the, world, to, proclaim, god, is, dead, and, to, reject, all, systematic, philosophy, and, all, striving, for, a, fixed, truth, transcending, the, individual, nietzsche, found, in, this, not, grounds, for, pessimism, but, the, possibility, of, a, new, kind, of, freedom, 19th, century, british, philosophy, came, increasingly, to, be, dominated, by, strands, of, british, idealism, which, incorporated, neo, hegelian, and, german, idealist, thought, as, a, reaction, against, this, figures, such, as, bertrand, russell, and, george, edward, moore, began, moving, in, the, direction, of, analytic, philosophy, which, was, essentially, an, updating, of, traditional, empiricism, to, accommodate, the, new, developments, in, logic, of, the, german, mathematician, gottlob, frege, renaissance, humanism, emphasized, the, value, of, human, beings, see, oration, on, the, dignity, of, man, and, opposed, dogma, and, scholasticism, this, new, interest, in, human, activities, led, to, the, development, of, political, science, with, the, prince, of, niccol, machiavelli, humanists, differed, from, medieval, scholars, also, because, they, saw, the, natural, world, as, mathematically, ordered, and, pluralistic, instead, of, thinking, of, it, in, terms, of, purposes, and, goals, renaissance, philosophy, is, perhaps, best, explained, by, two, propositions, made, by, leonardo, da, vinci, in, his, notebooks, in, a, similar, way, galileo, galilei, based, his, scientific, method, on, experiments, but, also, developed, mathematical, methods, for, application, to, problems, in, physics, these, two, ways, to, conceive, human, knowledge, formed, the, background, for, the, principle, of, empiricism, and, rationalism, respectively, list, of, renaissance, philosophers, modern, philosophy, traditionally, begins, with, ren, descartes, and, his, aphorism, i, think, therefore, i, am, in, the, early, seventeenth, century, the, bulk, of, philosophy, was, dominated, by, scholasticism, written, by, theologians, and, drawing, upon, plato, aristotle, and, early, church, writings, descartes, argued, that, many, predominant, scholastic, metaphysical, doctrines, were, meaningless, or, false, in, short, he, proposed, to, begin, philosophy, from, scratch, in, his, most, important, work, meditations, on, first, philosophy, he, attempts, just, this, over, six, brief, essays, he, tries, to, set, aside, as, much, as, he, possibly, can, of, all, his, beliefs, to, determine, what, if, anything, he, knows, for, certain, he, finds, that, he, can, doubt, nearly, everything, the, reality, of, physical, objects, god, his, memories, history, science, even, mathematics, but, he, cannot, doubt, that, he, is, in, fact, doubting, he, knows, what, he, is, thinking, about, even, if, it, is, not, true, and, he, knows, that, he, is, there, thinking, about, it, from, this, basis, he, builds, his, knowledge, back, up, again, he, finds, that, some, of, the, ideas, he, has, could, not, have, originated, from, him, alone, but, only, from, god, he, proves, that, god, exists, he, then, demonstrates, that, god, would, not, allow, him, to, be, systematically, deceived, about, everything, in, essence, he, vindicates, ordinary, methods, of, science, and, reasoning, as, fallible, but, not, false, list, of, rationalist, philosophers, empiricism, is, a, theory, of, knowledge, which, opposes, other, theories, of, knowledge, such, as, rationalism, idealism, and, historicism, empiricism, asserts, that, knowledge, comes, only, or, primarily, via, sensory, experience, as, opposed, to, rationalism, which, asserts, that, knowledge, comes, also, from, pure, thinking, both, empiricism, and, rationalism, are, individualist, theories, of, knowledge, whereas, historicism, is, a, social, epistemology, while, historicism, also, acknowledges, the, role, of, experience, it, differs, from, empiricism, by, assuming, that, sensory, data, cannot, be, understood, without, considering, the, historical, and, cultural, circumstances, in, which, observations, are, made, empiricism, should, not, be, mixed, up, with, empirical, research, because, different, epistemologies, should, be, considered, competing, views, on, how, best, to, do, studies, and, there, is, near, consensus, among, researchers, that, studies, should, be, empirical, today, empiricism, should, therefore, be, understood, as, one, among, competing, ideals, of, getting, knowledge, or, how, to, do, studies, as, such, empiricism, is, first, and, foremost, characterized, by, the, ideal, to, let, observational, data, speak, for, themselves, while, the, competing, views, are, opposed, to, this, ideal, the, term, empiricism, should, thus, not, just, be, understood, in, relation, to, how, this, term, has, been, used, in, the, history, of, philosophy, it, should, also, be, constructed, in, a, way, which, makes, it, possible, to, distinguish, empiricism, among, other, epistemological, positions, in, contemporary, science, and, scholarship, in, other, words, empiricism, as, a, concept, has, to, be, constructed, along, with, other, concepts, which, together, make, it, possible, to, make, important, discriminations, between, different, ideals, underlying, contemporary, science, empiricism, is, one, of, several, competing, views, that, predominate, in, the, study, of, human, knowledge, known, as, epistemology, empiricism, emphasizes, the, role, of, experience, and, evidence, especially, sensory, perception, in, the, formation, of, ideas, over, the, notion, of, innate, ideas, or, tradition, in, contrast, to, for, example, rationalism, which, relies, upon, reason, and, can, incorporate, innate, knowledge, list, of, empiricist, philosophers, political, philosophy, is, the, study, of, such, topics, as, politics, liberty, justice, property, rights, law, and, the, enforcement, of, a, legal, code, by, authority, their, nature, and, purpose, what, if, anything, makes, a, government, legitimate, what, rights, and, freedoms, if, any, it, should, protect, and, how, and, why, it, should, do, so, what, duties, if, any, citizens, owe, to, a, legitimate, government, and, when, if, ever, it, may, be, legitimately, overthrown, in, a, vernacular, sense, the, term, political, philosophy, often, refers, to, a, general, view, or, specific, ethic, political, belief, or, attitude, about, politics, that, does, not, necessarily, belong, to, the, technical, discipline, of, philosophy, list, of, political, philosophers, by, country, idealism, refers, to, the, group, of, philosophies, which, assert, that, reality, or, reality, as, we, can, know, it, is, fundamentally, a, construct, of, the, mind, or, otherwise, immaterial, epistemologically, idealism, manifests, as, a, skepticism, about, the, possibility, of, knowing, any, mind, independent, thing, in, a, sociological, sense, idealism, emphasizes, how, human, ideas, especially, beliefs, and, values, shape, society, as, an, ontological, doctrine, idealism, goes, further, asserting, that, all, entities, are, composed, of, mind, or, spirit, idealism, thus, rejects, physicalist, and, dualist, theories, that, fail, to, ascribe, priority, to, the, mind, an, extreme, version, of, this, idealism, can, exist, in, the, philosophical, notion, of, solipsism, list, of, idealist, philosophers, existentialism, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, philosophical, and, cultural, movement, which, holds, that, the, starting, point, of, philosophical, thinking, must, be, the, individual, and, the, experiences, of, the, individual, building, on, that, existentialists, hold, that, moral, thinking, and, scientific, thinking, together, do, not, suffice, to, understand, human, existence, and, therefore, a, further, set, of, categories, governed, by, the, norm, of, authenticity, is, necessary, to, understand, human, existence, list, of, existentialist, philosophers, phenomenology, is, the, study, of, the, structure, of, experience, it, is, a, broad, philosophical, movement, founded, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, by, edmund, husserl, expanded, upon, by, a, circle, of, his, followers, at, the, universities, of, g, ttingen, and, munich, in, germany, the, philosophy, then, spread, to, france, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, often, in, contexts, far, removed, from, husserl, s, early, work, list, of, phenomenologist, pragmatism, is, a, philosophical, tradition, centered, on, the, linking, of, practice, and, theory, it, describes, a, process, where, theory, is, extracted, from, practice, and, applied, back, to, practice, to, form, what, is, called, intelligent, practice, important, positions, characteristic, of, pragmatism, include, instrumentalism, radical, empiricism, verificationism, conceptual, relativity, and, fallibilism, there, is, general, consensus, among, pragmatists, that, philosophy, should, take, the, methods, and, insights, of, modern, science, into, account, charles, sanders, peirce, and, his, pragmatic, maxim, deserves, most, of, the, credit, for, pragmatism, along, with, later, twentieth, century, contributors, william, james, and, john, dewey, list, of, pragmatist,
