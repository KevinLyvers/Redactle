and, aim, to, control, yoke, and, still, the, mind, recognizing, a, detached, witness, consciousness, untouched, by, the, mind, chitta, and, mundane, suffering, du, kha, there, is, a, wide, variety, of, schools, of, yoga, practices, and, goals, in, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, and, traditional, and, modern, yoga, is, practiced, worldwide, yoga, like, practices, were, first, mentioned, in, the, ancient, hindu, text, known, as, rigveda, yoga, is, referred, to, in, a, number, of, the, upanishads, the, first, known, appearance, of, the, word, yoga, with, the, same, meaning, as, the, modern, term, is, in, the, katha, upanishad, which, was, probably, composed, between, the, fifth, and, third, centuries, bce, yoga, continued, to, develop, as, a, systematic, study, and, practice, during, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, bce, in, ancient, india, s, ascetic, and, rama, a, movements, the, most, comprehensive, text, on, yoga, the, yoga, sutras, of, patanjali, date, to, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, yoga, philosophy, became, known, as, one, of, the, six, orthodox, philosophical, schools, dar, anas, of, hinduism, in, the, second, half, of, the, first, millennium, ce, hatha, yoga, texts, began, to, emerge, between, the, ninth, and, 11th, centuries, originating, in, tantra, two, general, theories, exist, on, the, origins, of, yoga, the, linear, model, holds, that, yoga, originated, in, the, vedic, period, as, reflected, in, the, vedic, textual, corpus, and, influenced, buddhism, according, to, author, edward, fitzpatrick, crangle, this, model, is, mainly, supported, by, hindu, scholars, according, to, the, synthesis, model, yoga, is, a, synthesis, of, non, vedic, and, vedic, elements, this, model, is, favoured, in, western, scholarship, the, term, yoga, in, the, western, world, often, denotes, a, modern, form, of, hatha, yoga, and, a, posture, based, physical, fitness, stress, relief, and, relaxation, technique, consisting, largely, of, asanas, this, differs, from, traditional, yoga, which, focuses, on, meditation, and, release, from, worldly, attachments, it, was, introduced, by, gurus, from, india, after, the, success, of, swami, vivekananda, s, adaptation, of, yoga, without, asanas, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, vivekananda, introduced, the, yoga, sutras, to, the, west, and, they, became, prominent, after, the, 20th, century, success, of, hatha, yoga, the, sanskrit, noun, yoga, is, derived, from, the, root, yuj, to, attach, join, harness, yoke, yoga, is, a, cognate, of, the, english, word, yoke, according, to, mikel, burley, the, first, use, of, the, root, of, the, word, yoga, is, in, hymn, 5, 81, 1, of, the, rigveda, a, dedication, to, the, rising, sun, god, where, it, has, been, interpreted, as, yoke, or, control, p, ini, 4th, c, bce, wrote, that, the, term, yoga, can, be, derived, from, either, of, two, roots, yujir, yoga, to, yoke, or, yuj, sam, dhau, to, concentrate, in, the, context, of, the, yoga, sutras, the, root, yuj, sam, dhau, to, concentrate, is, considered, the, correct, etymology, by, traditional, commentators, in, accordance, with, p, ini, vyasa, who, wrote, the, first, commentary, on, the, yoga, sutras, says, that, yoga, means, samadhi, concentration, a, person, who, practices, yoga, or, follows, the, yoga, philosophy, with, a, high, level, of, commitment, is, called, a, yogi, a, female, yogi, may, also, be, known, as, a, yogini, the, term, yoga, has, been, defined, in, different, ways, in, indian, philosophical, and, religious, traditions, yoga, is, skill, in, action, 2, 50, know, that, which, is, called, yoga, to, be, separation, from, contact, with, suffering, 6, 23, the, ultimate, goals, of, yoga, are, stilling, the, mind, and, gaining, insight, resting, in, detached, awareness, and, liberation, moksha, from, sa, s, ra, and, du, kha, a, process, or, discipline, leading, to, unity, aikyam, with, the, divine, brahman, or, with, one, s, self, tman, this, goal, varies, by, philosophical, or, theological, system, in, the, classical, astanga, yoga, system, the, ultimate, goal, of, yoga, is, to, achieve, samadhi, and, remain, in, that, state, as, pure, awareness, according, to, knut, a, jacobsen, yoga, has, five, principal, meanings, david, gordon, white, writes, that, yoga, s, core, principles, were, more, or, less, in, place, in, the, 5th, century, ce, and, variations, of, the, principles, developed, over, time, according, to, white, the, last, principle, relates, to, legendary, goals, of, yoga, practice, it, differs, from, yoga, s, practical, goals, in, south, asian, thought, and, practice, since, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, in, hindu, buddhist, and, jain, philosophical, schools, there, is, no, consensus, on, yoga, s, chronology, or, origins, other, than, its, development, in, ancient, india, there, are, two, broad, theories, explaining, the, origins, of, yoga, the, linear, model, holds, that, yoga, has, vedic, origins, as, reflected, in, vedic, texts, and, influenced, buddhism, this, model, is, mainly, supported, by, hindu, scholars, according, to, the, synthesis, model, yoga, is, a, synthesis, of, indigenous, non, vedic, practices, with, vedic, elements, this, model, is, favoured, in, western, scholarship, speculations, about, yoga, began, to, emerge, in, the, early, upanishads, of, the, first, half, of, the, first, millennium, bce, with, expositions, also, appearing, in, jain, and, buddhist, texts, c, 500, c, 200, bce, between, 200, bce, and, 500, ce, traditions, of, hindu, buddhist, and, jain, philosophy, were, taking, shape, teachings, were, collected, as, sutras, and, a, philosophical, system, of, patanjaliyogasastra, began, to, emerge, the, middle, ages, saw, the, development, of, a, number, of, yoga, satellite, traditions, it, and, other, aspects, of, indian, philosophy, came, to, the, attention, of, the, educated, western, public, during, the, mid, 19th, century, according, to, edward, fitzpatrick, crangle, hindu, researchers, have, favoured, a, linear, theory, which, attempts, to, interpret, the, origin, and, early, development, of, indian, contemplative, practices, as, a, sequential, growth, from, an, aryan, genesis, traditional, hinduism, regards, the, vedas, as, the, source, of, all, spiritual, knowledge, edwin, bryant, wrote, that, authors, who, support, indigenous, aryanism, also, tend, to, support, the, linear, model, heinrich, zimmer, was, an, exponent, of, the, synthesis, model, arguing, for, non, vedic, eastern, states, of, india, according, to, zimmer, yoga, is, part, of, a, non, vedic, system, which, includes, the, samkhya, school, of, hindu, philosophy, jainism, and, buddhism, does, not, derive, from, brahman, aryan, sources, but, reflects, the, cosmology, and, anthropology, of, a, much, older, pre, aryan, upper, class, of, northeastern, india, being, rooted, in, the, same, subsoil, of, archaic, metaphysical, speculation, as, yoga, sankhya, and, buddhism, the, other, non, vedic, indian, systems, richard, gombrich, and, geoffrey, samuel, believe, that, the, rama, a, movement, originated, in, non, vedic, greater, magadha, thomas, mcevilley, favors, a, composite, model, in, which, a, pre, aryan, yoga, prototype, existed, in, the, pre, vedic, period, and, was, refined, during, the, vedic, period, according, to, gavin, d, flood, the, upanishads, differ, fundamentally, from, the, vedic, ritual, tradition, and, indicate, non, vedic, influences, however, the, traditions, may, be, connected, his, dichotomization, is, too, simplistic, for, continuities, can, undoubtedly, be, found, between, renunciation, and, vedic, brahmanism, while, elements, from, non, brahmanical, sramana, traditions, also, played, an, important, part, in, the, formation, of, the, renunciate, ideal, the, ascetic, traditions, of, the, eastern, ganges, plain, are, thought, to, drew, from, a, common, body, of, practices, and, philosophies, with, proto, samkhya, concepts, of, purusha, and, prakriti, as, a, common, denominator, the, twentieth, century, scholars, karel, werner, thomas, mcevilley, and, mircea, eliade, believe, that, the, central, figure, of, the, pashupati, seal, is, in, a, mulabandhasana, posture, and, the, roots, of, yoga, are, in, the, indus, valley, civilisation, this, is, rejected, by, more, recent, scholarship, for, example, geoffrey, samuel, andrea, r, jain, and, wendy, doniger, describe, the, identification, as, speculative, the, meaning, of, the, figure, will, remain, unknown, until, harappan, script, is, deciphered, and, the, roots, of, yoga, cannot, be, linked, to, the, ivc, the, vedas, the, only, texts, preserved, from, the, early, vedic, period, and, codified, between, c, 1200, and, 900, bce, contain, references, to, yogic, practices, primarily, related, to, ascetics, outside, or, on, the, fringes, of, brahmanism, the, rigveda, s, nasadiya, sukta, suggests, an, early, brahmanic, contemplative, tradition, techniques, for, controlling, breath, and, vital, energies, are, mentioned, in, the, atharvaveda, and, in, the, brahmanas, the, second, layer, of, the, vedas, composed, c, 1000, 800, bce, according, to, flood, the, samhitas, contain, some, references, to, ascetics, namely, the, munis, or, ke, ins, and, the, vratyas, werner, wrote, in, 1977, that, the, rigveda, does, not, describe, yoga, and, there, is, little, evidence, of, practices, the, earliest, description, of, an, outsider, who, does, not, belong, to, the, brahminic, establishment, is, found, in, the, ke, in, hymn, 10, 136, the, rigveda, s, youngest, book, which, was, codified, around, 1000, bce, werner, wrote, that, there, were, individuals, who, were, active, outside, the, trend, of, vedic, mythological, creativity, and, the, brahminic, religious, orthodoxy, and, therefore, little, evidence, of, their, existence, practices, and, achievements, has, survived, and, such, evidence, as, is, available, in, the, vedas, themselves, is, scanty, and, indirect, nevertheless, the, indirect, evidence, is, strong, enough, not, to, allow, any, doubt, about, the, existence, of, spiritually, highly, advanced, wanderers, according, to, whicher, 1998, scholarship, frequently, fails, to, see, the, connection, between, the, contemplative, practices, of, the, rishis, and, later, yoga, practices, the, proto, yoga, of, the, vedic, rishis, is, an, early, form, of, sacrificial, mysticism, and, contains, many, elements, characteristic, of, later, yoga, that, include, concentration, meditative, observation, ascetic, forms, of, practice, tapas, breath, control, practiced, in, conjunction, with, the, recitation, of, sacred, hymns, during, the, ritual, the, notion, of, self, sacrifice, impeccably, accurate, recitation, of, sacred, words, prefiguring, mantra, yoga, mystical, experience, and, the, engagement, with, a, reality, far, greater, than, our, psychological, identity, or, the, ego, jacobsen, wrote, in, 2018, bodily, postures, are, closely, related, to, the, tradition, of, tapas, ascetic, practices, in, the, vedic, tradition, ascetic, practices, used, by, vedic, priests, in, their, preparations, for, the, performance, of, the, sacrifice, may, be, precursors, of, yoga, the, ecstatic, practice, of, enigmatic, longhaired, muni, in, rgveda, 10, 136, and, the, ascetic, performance, of, the, vratya, s, in, the, atharvaveda, outside, of, or, on, the, fringe, of, the, brahmanical, ritual, order, have, probably, contributed, more, to, the, ascetic, practices, of, yoga, according, to, bryant, practices, recognizable, as, classical, yoga, first, appear, in, the, upanishads, composed, during, the, late, vedic, period, alexander, wynne, agrees, that, formless, elemental, meditation, might, have, originated, in, the, upanishadic, tradition, an, early, reference, to, meditation, is, made, in, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, c, 900, bce, one, of, the, principal, upanishads, the, chandogya, upanishad, c, 800, 700, bce, describes, the, five, vital, energies, prana, and, concepts, of, later, yoga, traditions, such, as, blood, vessels, and, an, internal, sound, are, also, described, in, this, upanishad, the, practice, of, pranayama, focusing, on, the, breath, is, mentioned, in, hymn, 1, 5, 23, of, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, and, pratyahara, withdrawal, of, the, senses, is, mentioned, in, hymn, 8, 15, of, chandogya, upanishad, the, jaiminiya, upanishad, brahmana, probably, before, the, 6th, c, bce, teaches, breath, control, and, repetition, of, a, mantra, the, 6th, c, bce, taittiriya, upanishad, defines, yoga, as, the, mastery, of, body, and, senses, according, to, flood, he, actual, term, yoga, first, appears, in, the, katha, upanishad, dated, to, the, fifth, to, first, centuries, bce, systematic, yoga, concepts, begin, to, emerge, in, texts, dating, to, c, 500, 200, bce, such, as, the, early, buddhist, texts, the, middle, upanishads, and, the, mahabharata, s, bhagavad, gita, and, shanti, parva, according, to, geoffrey, samuel, the, best, evidence, to, date, suggests, that, yogic, practices, developed, in, the, same, ascetic, circles, as, the, early, rama, a, movements, buddhists, jainas, and, ajivikas, probably, in, around, the, sixth, and, fifth, centuries, bce, this, occurred, during, india, s, second, urbanisation, period, according, to, mallinson, and, singleton, these, traditions, were, the, first, to, use, mind, body, techniques, known, as, dhy, na, and, tapas, but, later, described, as, yoga, to, strive, for, liberation, from, the, round, of, rebirth, werner, writes, the, buddha, was, the, founder, of, his, system, even, though, admittedly, he, made, use, of, some, of, the, experiences, he, had, previously, gained, under, various, yoga, teachers, of, his, time, he, notes, but, it, is, only, with, buddhism, itself, as, expounded, in, the, pali, canon, that, we, can, speak, about, a, systematic, and, comprehensive, or, even, integral, school, of, yoga, practice, which, is, thus, the, first, and, oldest, to, have, been, preserved, for, us, in, its, entirety, early, buddhist, texts, describe, yogic, and, meditative, practices, some, of, which, the, buddha, borrowed, from, the, rama, a, tradition, the, p, li, canon, contains, three, passages, in, which, the, buddha, describes, pressing, the, tongue, against, the, palate, to, control, hunger, or, the, mind, depending, on, the, passage, there, is, no, mention, of, the, tongue, inserted, into, the, nasopharynx, as, in, khecar, mudr, the, buddha, used, a, posture, in, which, pressure, is, put, on, the, perineum, with, the, heel, similar, to, modern, postures, used, to, evoke, kundalini, suttas, which, discuss, yogic, practice, include, the, satipatthana, sutta, the, four, foundations, of, mindfulness, sutta, and, the, anapanasati, sutta, the, mindfulness, of, breathing, sutta, the, chronology, of, these, yoga, related, early, buddhist, texts, like, the, ancient, hindu, texts, is, unclear, early, buddhist, sources, such, as, the, majjhima, nik, ya, mention, meditation, the, a, guttara, nik, ya, describes, jh, yins, meditators, who, resemble, early, hindu, descriptions, of, muni, the, kesin, and, meditating, ascetics, but, the, meditation, practices, are, not, called, yoga, in, these, texts, the, earliest, known, discussions, of, yoga, in, buddhist, literature, as, understood, in, a, modern, context, are, from, the, later, buddhist, yog, c, ra, and, theravada, schools, jain, meditation, is, a, yoga, system, which, predated, the, buddhist, school, since, jain, sources, are, later, than, buddhist, ones, however, it, is, difficult, to, distinguish, between, the, early, jain, school, and, elements, derived, from, other, schools, most, of, the, other, contemporary, yoga, systems, alluded, to, in, the, upanishads, and, some, buddhist, texts, have, been, lost, the, upanishads, composed, in, the, late, vedic, period, contain, the, first, references, to, practices, recognizable, as, classical, yoga, the, first, known, appearance, of, the, word, yoga, in, the, modern, sense, is, in, the, katha, upanishad, probably, composed, between, the, fifth, and, third, centuries, bce, where, it, is, defined, as, steady, control, of, the, senses, which, with, cessation, of, mental, activity, leads, to, a, supreme, state, the, katha, upanishad, integrates, the, monism, of, the, early, upanishads, with, concepts, of, samkhya, and, yoga, it, defines, levels, of, existence, by, their, proximity, to, one, s, innermost, being, yoga, is, viewed, as, a, process, of, interiorization, or, ascent, of, consciousness, the, upanishad, is, the, earliest, literary, work, which, highlights, the, fundamentals, of, yoga, according, to, white, the, earliest, extant, systematic, account, of, yoga, and, a, bridge, from, the, earlier, vedic, uses, of, the, term, is, found, in, the, hindu, katha, upanisad, ku, a, scripture, dating, from, about, the, third, century, bce, t, describes, the, hierarchy, of, mind, body, constituents, the, senses, mind, intellect, etc, that, comprise, the, foundational, categories, of, s, mkhya, philosophy, whose, metaphysical, system, grounds, the, yoga, of, the, yogasutras, bhagavad, gita, and, other, texts, and, schools, ku3, 10, 11, 6, 7, 8, the, hymns, in, book, two, of, the, shvetashvatara, upanishad, another, late, first, millennium, bce, text, describe, a, procedure, in, which, the, body, is, upright, the, breath, is, restrained, and, the, mind, is, meditatively, focused, preferably, in, a, cave, or, a, place, that, is, simple, and, quiet, the, maitrayaniya, upanishad, probably, composed, later, than, the, katha, and, shvetashvatara, upanishads, but, before, the, yoga, sutras, of, patanjali, mentions, a, sixfold, yoga, method, breath, control, introspective, withdrawal, of, the, senses, meditation, dhyana, mental, concentration, logic, and, reasoning, and, spiritual, union, in, addition, to, discussions, in, the, principal, upanishads, the, twenty, yoga, upanishads, and, related, texts, such, as, yoga, vasistha, composed, between, the, sixth, and, 14th, centuries, ce, discuss, yoga, methods, alexander, the, great, reached, india, in, the, 4th, century, bce, in, addition, to, his, army, he, brought, greek, academics, who, wrote, memoirs, about, its, geography, people, and, customs, one, of, alexander, s, companions, was, onesicritus, quoted, in, book, 15, sections, 63, 65, by, strabo, in, his, geography, who, describes, yogis, onesicritus, says, that, the, yogis, were, aloof, and, adopted, different, postures, standing, or, sitting, or, lying, naked, and, motionless, onesicritus, also, mentions, attempts, by, his, colleague, calanus, to, meet, them, initially, denied, an, audience, he, was, later, invited, because, he, was, sent, by, a, king, curious, of, wisdom, and, philosophy, onesicritus, and, calanus, learn, that, the, yogis, consider, life, s, best, doctrines, to, rid, the, spirit, of, not, only, pain, but, also, pleasure, that, man, trains, the, body, for, toil, in, order, that, his, opinions, may, be, strengthened, that, there, is, no, shame, in, life, on, frugal, fare, and, that, the, best, place, to, inhabit, is, one, with, scantiest, equipment, or, outfit, according, to, charles, rockwell, lanman, these, principles, are, significant, in, the, history, of, yoga, s, spiritual, side, and, may, reflect, the, roots, of, undisturbed, calmness, and, mindfulness, through, balance, in, the, later, works, of, patanjali, and, buddhaghosa, nirodhayoga, yoga, of, cessation, an, early, form, of, yoga, is, described, in, the, mokshadharma, section, of, the, 12th, chapter, shanti, parva, of, the, third, century, bce, mahabharata, nirodhayoga, emphasizes, progressive, withdrawal, from, empirical, consciousness, including, thoughts, and, sensations, until, purusha, self, is, realized, terms, such, as, vichara, subtle, reflection, and, viveka, discrimination, similar, to, patanjali, s, terminology, are, used, but, not, described, although, the, mahabharata, contains, no, uniform, yogic, goal, the, separation, of, self, from, matter, and, perception, of, brahman, everywhere, are, described, as, goals, of, yoga, samkhya, and, yoga, are, conflated, and, some, verses, describe, them, as, identical, mokshadharma, also, describes, an, early, practice, of, elemental, meditation, the, mahabharata, defines, the, purpose, of, yoga, as, uniting, the, individual, tman, with, the, universal, brahman, pervading, all, things, the, bhagavad, gita, song, of, the, lord, part, of, the, mahabharata, contains, extensive, teachings, about, yoga, according, to, mallinson, and, singleton, the, gita, seeks, to, appropriate, yoga, from, the, renunciate, milieu, in, which, it, originated, teaching, that, it, is, compatible, with, worldly, activity, carried, out, according, to, one, s, caste, and, life, stage, it, is, only, the, fruits, of, one, s, actions, that, are, to, be, renounced, in, addition, to, a, chapter, chapter, six, dedicated, to, traditional, yoga, practice, including, meditation, it, introduces, three, significant, types, of, yoga, the, gita, consists, of, 18, chapters, and, 700, shlokas, verses, each, chapter, is, named, for, a, different, form, of, yoga, some, scholars, divide, the, gita, into, three, sections, the, first, six, chapters, 280, shlokas, deal, with, karma, yoga, the, middle, six, 209, shlokas, with, bhakti, yoga, and, the, last, six, 211, shlokas, with, jnana, yoga, however, elements, of, all, three, are, found, throughout, the, work, yoga, is, discussed, in, the, foundational, sutras, of, hindu, philosophy, the, vai, e, ika, s, tra, of, the, vaisheshika, school, of, hinduism, composed, between, the, sixth, and, second, centuries, bce, discusses, yoga, according, to, johannes, bronkhorst, the, vai, e, ika, s, tra, describes, yoga, as, a, state, where, the, mind, resides, only, in, the, self, and, therefore, not, in, the, senses, this, is, equivalent, to, pratyahara, withdrawal, of, the, senses, the, sutra, asserts, that, yoga, leads, to, an, absence, of, sukha, happiness, and, dukkha, suffering, describing, meditative, steps, in, the, journey, towards, spiritual, liberation, the, brahma, sutras, the, foundation, text, of, the, vedanta, school, of, hinduism, also, discusses, yoga, estimated, as, completed, in, its, surviving, form, between, 450, bce, and, 200, ce, its, sutras, assert, that, yoga, is, a, means, to, attain, subtlety, of, body, the, nyaya, sutras, the, foundation, text, of, the, nyaya, school, estimated, as, composed, between, the, sixth, century, bce, and, the, secondcentury, ce, discusses, yoga, in, sutras, 4, 2, 38, 50, it, includes, a, discussion, of, yogic, ethics, dhyana, meditation, and, samadhi, noting, that, debate, and, philosophy, are, also, forms, of, yoga, the, indic, traditions, of, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, were, taking, shape, during, the, period, between, the, mauryan, and, the, gupta, eras, c, 200, bce, 500, ce, and, systems, of, yoga, began, to, emerge, a, number, of, texts, from, these, traditions, discussed, and, compiled, yoga, methods, and, practices, key, works, of, the, era, include, the, yoga, s, tras, of, pata, jali, the, yoga, y, j, avalkya, the, yog, c, rabh, mi, stra, and, the, visuddhimagga, one, of, the, best, known, early, expressions, of, brahminical, yoga, thought, is, the, yoga, sutras, of, patanjali, early, centuries, ce, the, original, name, of, which, may, have, been, the, p, ta, jalayoga, stra, s, khya, pravacana, c, 325, 425, ce, some, scholars, believe, that, it, included, the, sutras, and, a, commentary, as, the, name, suggests, the, metaphysical, basis, of, the, text, is, samkhya, the, school, is, mentioned, in, kau, ilya, s, arthashastra, as, one, of, the, three, categories, of, anviksikis, philosophies, with, yoga, and, c, rv, ka, yoga, and, samkhya, have, some, differences, yoga, accepted, the, concept, of, a, personal, god, and, samkhya, was, a, rational, non, theistic, system, of, hindu, philosophy, patanjali, s, system, is, sometimes, called, seshvara, samkhya, distinguishing, it, from, kapila, s, nirivara, samkhya, the, parallels, between, yoga, and, samkhya, were, so, close, that, max, m, ller, says, the, two, philosophies, were, in, popular, parlance, distinguished, from, each, other, as,
