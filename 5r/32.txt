of, humanity, and, thus, is, valued, as, an, end, purpose, of, life, or, a, foundational, principle, of, being, in, human, practical, ethics, a, virtue, is, a, disposition, to, choose, actions, that, succeed, in, showing, high, moral, standards, doing, what, is, said, to, be, right, and, avoiding, what, is, wrong, in, a, given, field, of, endeavour, even, when, doing, so, may, be, unnecessary, from, a, utilitarian, perspective, when, someone, takes, pleasure, in, doing, what, is, right, even, when, it, is, difficult, or, initially, unpleasant, they, can, establish, virtue, as, a, habit, such, a, person, is, said, to, be, virtuous, through, having, cultivated, such, a, disposition, the, opposite, of, virtue, is, vice, and, the, vicious, person, takes, pleasure, in, habitual, wrong, doing, to, their, detriment, other, examples, of, this, notion, include, the, concept, of, merit, in, asian, traditions, as, well, as, de, chinese, buddhism, s, four, brahmavihara, lit, divine, states, can, be, regarded, as, virtues, in, the, european, sense, the, ancient, romans, used, the, latin, word, virtus, derived, from, vir, their, word, for, man, to, refer, to, all, of, the, excellent, qualities, of, men, including, physical, strength, valorous, conduct, and, moral, rectitude, the, french, words, vertu, and, virtu, came, from, this, latin, root, the, word, virtue, was, borrowed, into, english, in, the, 13th, century, maat, or, ma, at, was, the, ancient, egyptian, goddess, of, truth, balance, order, law, morality, and, justice, the, word, maat, was, also, used, to,

traced, to, greek, philosophy, and, was, listed, by, plato, who, also, added, piety, hosiot, s, and, replaced, prudence, with, wisdom, some, scholars, consider, either, of, the, above, four, virtue, combinations, as, mutually, reducible, and, therefore, not, cardinal, it, is, unclear, whether, plato, subscribed, to, a, unified, view, of, virtues, in, protagoras, and, meno, he, states, that, the, separate, virtues, cannot, exist, independently, and, offers, as, evidence, the, contradictions, of, acting, with, wisdom, yet, in, an, unjust, way, or, acting, with, bravery, fortitude, yet, without, wisdom, in, his, nicomachean, ethics, aristotle, defined, a, virtue, as, a, point, between, a, deficiency, and, an, excess, of, a, trait, the, point, of, greatest, virtue, lies, not, in, the, exact, middle, but, at, a, golden, mean, sometimes, closer, to, one, extreme, than, the, other, however, the, virtuous, action, is, not, simply, the, mean, mathematically, speaking, between, two, opposite, extremes, as, aristotle, says, in, the, nicomachean, ethics, at, the, right, times, and, on, the, right, occasions, and, towards, the, right, persons, and, with, the, right, object, and, in, the, right, fashion, is, the, mean, course, and, the, best, course, and, these, are, characteristics, of, virtue, for, example, generosity, is, a, virtue, between, the, two, extremes, of, miserliness, and, being, profligate, further, examples, include, courage, between, cowardice, and, foolhardiness, and, confidence, between, self, deprecation, and, conceit, in, aristotle, s, sense, a, virtue, is, an, excellence, at, being, human, aristotle, also, identifies, the, intellectual, virtues, of, knowledge, art, practical, judgement, intuition, and, wisdom, the, term, virtue, itself, is, derived, from, the, latin, virtus, the, personification, of, which, was, the, deity, virtus, and, had, connotations, of, manliness, honour, worthiness, of, deferential, respect, and, civic, duty, as, both, citizen, and, soldier, this, virtue, was, but, one, of, many, virtues, which, romans, of, good, character, were, expected, to, exemplify, and, pass, on, through, the, generations, as, part, of, the, mos, maiorum, ancestral, traditions, which, defined, roman, ness, romans, distinguished, between, the, spheres, of, private, and, public, life, and, thus, virtues, were, also, divided, between, those, considered, to, be, in, the, realm, of, private, family, life, as, lived, and, taught, by, the, paterfamilias, and, those, expected, of, an, upstanding, roman, citizen, most, roman, concepts, of, virtue, were, also, personified, as, a, numinous, deity, the, primary, roman, virtues, both, public, and, private, were, while, religious, scriptures, generally, consider, dharma, or, a, am, the, tamil, term, for, virtue, as, a, divine, virtue, valluvar, describes, it, as, a, way, of, life, rather, than, any, spiritual, observance, a, way, of, harmonious, living, that, leads, to, universal, happiness, for, this, reason, valluvar, keeps, a, am, as, the, cornerstone, throughout, the, writing, of, the, kural, literature, valluvar, considered, justice, as, a, facet, or, product, of, a, am, while, many, before, his, time, opined, that, justice, cannot, be, defined, and, that, it, was, a, divine, mystery, valluvar, suggested, that, a, divine, origin, is, not, required, to, define, the, concept, of, justice, in, the, words, of, v, r, nedunchezhiyan, justice, according, to, valluvar, dwells, in, the, minds, of, those, who, have, knowledge, of, the, standard, of, right, and, wrong, so, too, deceit, dwells, in, the, minds, which, breed, fraud, in, the, 8th, century, ce, upon, the, occasion, of, his, coronation, as, holy, roman, emperor, charlemagne, published, a, list, of, knightly,

hope, and, love, a, list, which, comes, from, 1, corinthians, 13, 13, pistis, faith, elpis, hope, agape, love, the, same, chapter, describes, love, as, the, greatest, of, the, three, and, further, defines, love, as, patient, kind, not, envious, or, boastful, or, arrogant, or, rude, the, christian, virtue, of, love, is, sometimes, called, charity, and, at, other, times, a, greek, word, agape, is, used, to, contrast, the, love, of, god, and, the, love, of, humankind, from, other, types, of, love, such, as, friendship, or, physical, affection, christian, scholars, frequently, add, the, four, classic, cardinal, virtues, prudence, justice, temperance, and, courage, to, the, theological, virtues, to, give, the, seven, heavenly, virtues, for, example, these, seven, are, the, ones, described,

god, proverbs, 8, 12, 31, a, classic, articulation, of, the, golden, rule, came, from, the, first, century, rabbi, hillel, the, elder, renowned, in, the, jewish, tradition, as, a, sage, and, a, scholar, he, is, associated, with, the, development, of, the, mishnah, and, the, talmud, and, as, such, is, one, of, the, most, important, figures, in, jewish, history, asked, for, a, summary, of,

philosophy, particularly, daoism, de, chinese, pinyin, d, wade, giles, te, originally, meant, normative, virtue, in, the, sense, of, personal, character, inner, strength, integrity, but, semantically, changed, to, moral, virtue, kindness, morality, note, the, semantic, parallel, for, english, virtue, with, an, archaic, meaning, of, inner, potency, divine, power, as, in, by, virtue, of, and, a, modern, one, of, moral, excellence, goodness, in, early, periods, of, confucianism, moral, manifestations, of, virtue, include, ren, humanity, xiao, filial, piety, and, li, proper, behavior, performance, of, rituals, the, notion, of, ren, according, to, simon, leys, means, humanity, and, goodness, ren, originally, had, the, archaic, meaning, in, the, confucian, book, of, poems, of, virility, but, progressively, took, on, shades, of, ethical, meaning, some, scholars, consider, the, virtues, identified, in, early, confucianism, as, non, theistic, philosophy, the, daoist, concept, of, de, compared, to, confucianism, is, more, subtle, pertaining, to, the, virtue, or, ability, that, an, individual, realizes, by, following, the, dao, the, way, one, important, normative, value, in, much, of, chinese, thinking, is, that, one, s, social, status, should, result, from, the, amount, of, virtue, that, one, demonstrates, rather, than, from, one, s, birth, in, the, analects, confucius, explains, de, as, follows, he, who, exercises, government, by, means, of, his, virtue, may, be, compared, to, the, north, polar, star, which, keeps, its, place, and, all, the, stars, turn, towards,

symbols, that, represent, virtue, in, chinese, culture, chinese, classic, paintings, have, many, symbols, representing, virtue, plum, blossom, represents, resilience, and, perseverance, orchid, represents, elegance, gentleness, and, quietness, bamboo, represents, loyalty, trust, worthiness, and, humility, chrysanthemum, represents, genuineness, and, simplicity, virtue, is, a, much, debated, and, an, evolving, concept, in, ancient, scriptures, of, hinduism, the, essence, need, and, value, of, virtue, is, explained, in, hindu, philosophy, as, something, that, cannot, be, imposed, but, something, that, is, realized, and, voluntarily, lived, up, to, by, each, individual, for, example, apastamba, explained, it, thus, virtue, and, vice, do, not, go, about, saying, here, we, are, neither, the, gods, gandharvas, nor, ancestors, can, convince, us, this, is, right, this, is, wrong, virtue, is, an, elusive, concept, it, demands, careful, and, sustained, reflection, by, every, man, and, woman, before, it, can, become, part, of, one, s, life, virtues, lead, to, punya, holy, living, in, hindu, literature, while, vices, lead, to, pap, sin, sometimes, the, word, punya, is, used, interchangeably, with, virtue, the, virtues, that, constitute, a, dharmic, life, that, is, a, moral, ethical, virtuous, life, evolved, in, vedas, and, upanishads, over, time, new, virtues, were, conceptualized, and, added, by, ancient, hindu, scholars, some, replaced, others, merged, for, example, manusamhita, initially, listed, ten, virtues, necessary, for, a, human, being, to, live, a, dharmic, life, dhriti, courage, kshama, patience, and, forgiveness, dama, temperance, asteya, non, covetousness, non, stealing, saucha, inner, purity, indriyani, graha, control, of, senses, dhi, reflective, prudence, vidya, wisdom, satyam, truthfulness, and, akrodha, freedom, from, anger, in, later, verses, this, list, was, reduced, to, five, virtues, by, the, same, scholar, by, merging, and, creating, a, broader, concept, the, shorter, list, of, virtues, became, ahimsa, non, violence, dama, self, restraint, asteya, non, covetousness, non, stealing, saucha, inner, purity, and, satyam, truthfulness, the, bhagavad, gita, considered, one, of, the, epitomes, of, historic, hindu, discussion, of, virtues, and, an, allegorical, debate, on, what, is, right, and, what, is, wrong, argues, some, virtues, are, not, necessarily, always, absolute, but, sometimes, relational, for, example, it, explains, that, a, virtue, such, as, ahimsa, must, be, re, examined, when, one, is, faced, with, war, or, violence, from, the, aggressiveness, immaturity, or, ignorance, of, others, in, jainism, attainment, of, kaivalya, is, possible, only, if, the, seeker, possesses, certain, virtues, all, jains, are, supposed, to, take, up, the, five, vows, of, ahimsa, non, violence, satya, truthfulness, asteya, non, stealing, aparigraha, non, attachment, and, brahmacharya, celibacy, before, becoming, a, monk, these, vows, are, laid, down, by, the, t, rtha, karas, other, virtues, which, are, supposed, to, be, followed, by, both, monks, as, well, as, laypersons, include, forgiveness, humility, self, restraint, and, straightforwardness, these, vows, assist, the, seeker, to, escape, from, the, karmic, bondages, thereby, escaping, the, cycle, of, birth, and, death, to, attain, liberation, sikh, ethics, emphasize, the, congruence, between, spiritual, development, and, everyday, moral, conduct, its, founder, guru, nanak, summarized, this, perspective, truth, is, the, highest, virtue, but, higher, still, is, truthful, living, the, five, virtues, of, sikhism, are, sat, truth, daya, compassion, santokh, contentment, nimrata, humility, and, pyaar, love, for, the, rationalist, philosopher, ren, descartes, virtue, consists, in, the, correct, reasoning, that, should, guide, our, actions, men, should, seek, the, sovereign, good, that, descartes, following, zeno, identifies, with, virtue, as, this, produces, a, solid, blessedness, or, pleasure, for, epicurus, the, sovereign, good, was, pleasure, and, descartes, says, that, in, fact, this, is, not, in, contradiction, with, zeno, s, teaching, because, virtue, produces, a, spiritual, pleasure, that, is, better, than, bodily, pleasure, regarding, aristotle, s, opinion, that, happiness, depends, on, the, goods, of, fortune, descartes, does, not, deny, that, these, goods, contribute, to, happiness, but, remarks, that, they, are, in, great, proportion, outside, one, s, own, control, whereas, one, s, mind, is, under, one, s, complete, control, immanuel, kant, in, his, observations, on, the, feeling, of, the, beautiful, and, sublime, says, true, virtue, is, different, from, what, commonly, is, believed, about, it, in, kant, s, view, to, be, goodhearted, benevolent, and, sympathetic, is, not, true, virtue, what, makes, a, person, truly, virtuous, is, to, behave, in, accordance, with, moral, principles, kant, presents, an, example, suppose, that, you, come, across, a, needy, person, in, the, street, if, your, sympathy, leads, you, to, help, that, person, your, response, does, not, illustrate, your, virtue, in, this, example, since, you, do, not, afford, helping, all, needy, ones, you, have, behaved, unjustly, and, it, is, out, of, the, domain, of, principles, and, true, virtue, kant, applies, the, approach, of, four, temperaments, to, distinguish, truly, virtuous, people, according, to, kant, among, all, people, with, diverse, temperaments, a, person, with, a, melancholic, frame, of, mind, is, the, most, virtuous, whose, thoughts, words, and, deeds, are, principled, friedrich, nietzsche, s, view, of, virtue, is, based, on, the, idea, of, an, order, of, rank, among, people, for, nietzsche, the, virtues, of, the, strong, are, seen, as, vices, by, the, weak, and, slavish, thus, nietzsche, s, virtue, ethics, is, based, on, his, distinction, between, master, morality, and, slave, morality, nietzsche, promotes, the, virtues, of, those, he, calls, higher, men, people, like, goethe, and, beethoven, the, virtues, he, praises, in, them, are, their, creative, powers, the, men, of, great, creativity, the, really, great, men, according, to, my, understanding, 957, according, to, nietzsche, these, higher, types, are, solitary, pursue, a, unifying, project, revere, themselves, and, are, healthy, and, life, affirming, because, mixing, with, the, herd, makes, one, base, the, higher, type, strives, instinctively, for, a, citadel, and, a, secrecy, where, he, is, saved, from, the, crowd, the, many, the, great, majority, the, higher, type, also, instinctively, seeks, heavy, responsibilities, 944, in, the, form, of, an, organizing, idea, for, their, life, which, drives, them, to, artistic, and, creative, work, and, gives, them, psychological, health, and, strength, the, fact, that, the, higher, types, are, healthy, for, nietzsche, does, not, refer, to, physical, health, as, much, as, a, psychological, resilience, and, fortitude, finally, someone, of, the, higher, type, affirms, life, because, he, is, willing, to, accept, the, eternal, return, of, his, life, and, affirm, this, forever, and, unconditionally, in, the, last, section, of, beyond, good, and, evil, nietzsche, outlines, his, thoughts, on, the, noble, virtues, and, places, solitude, as, one, of, the, highest, virtues, and, to, keep, control, over, your, four, virtues, courage, insight, sympathy, solitude, because, solitude, is, a, virtue, for, us, since, it, is, a, sublime, inclination, and, impulse, to, cleanliness, which, shows, that, contact, between, people, society, inevitably, makes, things, unclean, somewhere, sometime, every, community, makes, people, base, 284, nietzsche, also, sees, truthfulness, as, a, virtue, genuine, honesty, assuming, that, this, is, our, virtue, and, we, cannot, get, rid, of, it, we, free, spirits, well, then, we, will, want, to, work, on, it, with, all, the, love, and, malice, at, our, disposal, and, not, get, tired, of, perfecting, ourselves, in, our, virtue, the, only, one, we, have, left, may, its, glory, come, to, rest, like, a, gilded, blue, evening, glow, of, mockery, over, this, aging, culture, and, its, dull, and, dismal, seriousness, 227, these, are, the, virtues, that, benjamin, franklin, used, to, develop, what, he, called, moral, perfection, he, had, a, checklist, in, a, notebook, to, measure, each, day, how, he, lived, up, to, his, virtues, they, became, known, through, benjamin, franklin, s, autobiography, marc, jackson, in, his, book, emotion, and, psyche, identifies, the, virtues, as, what, he, calls, the, good, emotions, the, first, group, consisting, of, love, kindness, joy, faith, awe, and, pity, is, good, these, virtues, differ, from, older, accounts, of, the, virtues, because, they, are, not, character, traits, expressed, by, action, but, emotions, that, are, to, be, felt, and, developed, by, feeling, not, acting, immanuel, kant, in, his, observations, on, the, feeling, of, the, beautiful, and, sublime, predicts, and, replies, to, marc, johnson, s, view, of, emotions, as, virtues, to, be, goodhearted, benevolent, and, sympathetic, is, not, true, virtue, for, one, acts, merely, episodically, motivated, by, appeasing, those, naturally, limited, feelings, such, as, in, the, presence, for, example, of, a, needy, person, in, the, street, in, such, a, case, we, do, not, act, for, a, universal, motive, but, simply, as, a, response, to, end, a, particular, individual, personal, distress, arisen, in, us, by, our, own, sentiments, christopher, peterson, and, martin, seligman, two, leading, researchers, in, positive, psychology, recognizing, the, deficiency, inherent, in, psychology, s, tendency, to, focus, on, dysfunction, rather, than, on, what, makes, a, healthy, and, stable, personality, set, out, to, develop, a, list, of, character, strengths, and, virtues, after, three, years, of, study, 24, traits, classified, into, six, broad, areas, of, virtue, were, identified, having, a, surprising, amount, of, similarity, across, cultures, and, strongly, indicat, a, historical, and, cross, cultural, convergence, 36, these, six, categories, of, virtue, are, courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and, wisdom, 36, 39, some, psychologists, suggest, that, these, virtues, are, adequately, grouped, into, fewer, categories, for, example, the, same, 24, traits, have, been, grouped, into, simply, cognitive, strengths, temperance, strengths, and, social, strengths, the, opposite, of, a, virtue, is, a, vice, vice, is, a, habitual, repeated, practice, of, wrongdoing, one, way, of, organizing, the, vices, is, as, the, corruption, of, the, virtues, as, aristotle, noted, however, the, virtues, can, have, several, opposites, virtues, can, be, considered, the, mean, between, two, extremes, as, the, latin, maxim, dictates, in, medio, stat, virtus, in, the, centre, lies, virtue, for, instance, both, cowardice, and, rashness, are, opposites, of, courage, contrary, to, prudence, are, both, over, caution, and, insufficient, caution, the, opposites, of, pride, a, virtue, are, undue, humility, and, excessive, vanity, a, more, modern, virtue, tolerance, can, be, considered, the, mean, between, the, two, extremes, of, narrow, mindedness, on, the, one, hand, and, over, acceptance, on, the, other, vices, can, therefore, be, identified, as, the, opposites, of, virtues, but, with, the, caveat, that, each, virtue, could, have, many, different, opposites, all, distinct, from, each, other, within, the, chinese, wuxing, philosophy, and, traditional, chinese, medicine, vice, and, virtue, are, expressed, as, excess, or, deficiency
