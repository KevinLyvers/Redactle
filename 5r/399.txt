healing, death, royalty, the, gallows, knowledge, war, battle, victory, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and, the, runic, alphabet, and, depicts, him, as, the, husband, of, the, goddess, frigg, in, wider, germanic, mythology, and, paganism, the, god, was, also, known, in, old, english, as, w, den, in, old, saxon, as, uu, den, in, old, dutch, as, wuodan, in, old, frisian, as, w, da, and, in, old, high, german, as, wuotan, all, ultimately, stemming, from, the, proto, germanic, theonym, w, anaz, meaning, lord, of, frenzy, or, leader, of, the, possessed, odin, appears, as, a, prominent, god, throughout, the, recorded, history, of, northern, europe, from, the, roman, occupation, of, regions, of, germania, from, c, 2, bce, through, movement, of, peoples, during, the, migration, period, 4th, to, 6th, centuries, ce, and, the, viking, age, 8th, to, 11th, centuries, ce, in, the, modern, period, the, rural, folklore, of, germanic, europe, continued, to, acknowledge, odin, references, to, him, appear, in, place, names, throughout, regions, historically, inhabited, by, the, ancient, germanic, peoples, and, the, day, of, the, week, wednesday, bears, his, name, in, many, germanic, languages, including, in, english, in, old, english, texts, odin, holds, a, particular, place, as, a, euhemerized, ancestral, figure, among, royalty, and, he, is, frequently, referred, to, as, a, founding, figure, among, various, other, germanic, peoples, such, as, the, langobards, while, some, old, norse, sources, depict, him, as, an, enthroned, ruler, of, the, gods, forms, of, his, name, appear, frequently, throughout, the, germanic, record, although, narratives, regarding, odin, are, mainly, found, in, old, norse, works, recorded, in, iceland, primarily, around, the, 13th, century, these, texts, make, up, the, bulk, of, modern, understanding, of, norse, mythology, old, norse, texts, portray, odin, as, the, son, of, bestla, and, borr, along, with, two, brothers, vili, and, v, and, he, fathered, many, sons, most, famously, the, gods, thor, with, j, r, and, baldr, with, frigg, he, is, known, by, hundreds, of, names, odin, is, frequently, portrayed, as, one, eyed, and, long, bearded, wielding, a, spear, named, gungnir, or, appearing, in, disguise, wearing, a, cloak, and, a, broad, hat, he, is, often, accompanied, by, his, animal, familiars, the, wolves, geri, and, freki, and, the, ravens, huginn, and, muninn, who, bring, him, information, from, all, over, midgard, and, he, rides, the, flying, eight, legged, steed, sleipnir, across, the, sky, and, into, the, underworld, in, these, texts, he, frequently, seeks, greater, knowledge, most, famously, by, obtaining, the, mead, of, poetry, and, makes, wagers, with, his, wife, frigg, over, his, endeavors, he, takes, part, both, in, the, creation, of, the, world, by, slaying, the, primordial, being, ymir, and, in, giving, life, to, the, first, two, humans, ask, and, embla, he, also, provides, mankind, knowledge, of, runic, writing, and, poetry, showing, aspects, of, a, culture, hero, he, has, a, particular, association, with, the, yule, holiday, odin, is, also, associated, with, the, divine, battlefield, maidens, the, valkyries, and, he, oversees, valhalla, where, he, receives, half, of, those, who, die, in, battle, the, einherjar, sending, the, other, half, to, the, goddess, freyja, s, f, lkvangr, odin, consults, the, disembodied, herb, embalmed, head, of, the, wise, m, mir, who, foretells, the, doom, of, ragnar, k, and, urges, odin, to, lead, the, einherjar, into, battle, before, being, consumed, by, the, monstrous, wolf, fenrir, in, later, folklore, odin, sometimes, appears, as, a, leader, of, the, wild, hunt, a, ghostly, procession, of, the, dead, through, the, winter, sky, he, is, associated, with, charms, and, other, forms, of, magic, particularly, in, old, english, and, old, norse, texts, the, figure, of, odin, is, a, frequent, subject, of, interest, in, germanic, studies, and, scholars, have, advanced, numerous, theories, regarding, his, development, some, of, these, focus, on, odin, s, particular, relation, to, other, figures, for, example, freyja, s, husband, r, appears, to, be, something, of, an, etymological, doublet, of, the, god, while, odin, s, wife, frigg, is, in, many, ways, similar, to, freyja, and, odin, has, a, particular, relation, to, loki, other, approaches, focus, on, odin, s, place, in, the, historical, record, exploring, whether, odin, derives, from, proto, indo, european, mythology, or, developed, later, in, germanic, society, in, the, modern, period, odin, has, inspired, numerous, works, of, poetry, music, and, other, cultural, expressions, he, is, venerated, with, other, germanic, gods, in, most, forms, of, the, new, religious, movement, heathenry, some, branches, focus, particularly, on, him, the, old, norse, theonym, inn, runic, on, the, ribe, skull, fragment, is, a, cognate, of, other, medieval, germanic, names, including, old, english, w, den, old, saxon, w, dan, old, dutch, wuodan, and, old, high, german, wuotan, old, bavarian, w, tan, they, all, derive, from, the, reconstructed, proto, germanic, masculine, theonym, w, anaz, or, w, dunaz, translated, as, lord, of, frenzy, or, as, leader, of, the, possessed, w, anaz, stems, from, the, proto, germanic, adjective, w, az, possessed, inspired, delirious, raging, attached, to, the, suffix, naz, master, of, internal, and, comparative, evidence, all, point, to, the, ideas, of, a, divine, possession, or, inspiration, and, an, ecstatic, divination, in, his, gesta, hammaburgensis, ecclesiae, pontificum, 1075, 1080, ad, adam, of, bremen, explicitly, associates, wotan, with, the, latin, term, furor, which, can, be, translated, as, rage, fury, madness, or, frenzy, wotan, id, est, furor, odin, that, is, furor, as, of, 2011, an, attestation, of, proto, norse, wo, inz, on, the, str, ngn, s, stone, has, been, accepted, as, probably, authentic, but, the, name, may, be, used, as, a, related, adjective, instead, meaning, with, a, gift, for, divine, possession, on, inn, other, germanic, cognates, derived, from, w, az, include, gothic, wo, s, possessed, old, norse, r, mad, frantic, furious, old, english, w, d, insane, frenzied, and, dutch, woed, frantic, wild, crazy, along, with, the, substantivized, forms, old, norse, r, mind, wit, sense, song, poetry, old, english, w, sound, noise, voice, song, old, high, german, wuot, thrill, violent, agitation, and, middle, dutch, woet, rage, frenzy, from, the, same, root, as, the, original, adjective, the, proto, germanic, terms, w, n, madness, fury, and, w, janan, to, rage, can, also, be, reconstructed, early, epigraphic, attestations, of, the, adjective, include, un, w, dz, calm, one, i, e, not, furious, 200, ce, and, w, du, r, de, furious, rider, 400, ce, philologist, jan, de, vries, has, argued, that, the, old, norse, deities, inn, and, r, were, probably, originally, connected, as, in, the, doublet, ullr, ullinn, with, r, w, az, being, the, elder, form, and, the, ultimate, source, of, the, name, inn, w, a, naz, he, further, suggested, that, the, god, of, rage, r, inn, stood, in, opposition, to, the, god, of, glorious, majesty, ullr, ullinn, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, vedic, contrast, between, varuna, and, mitra, the, adjective, w, az, ultimately, stems, from, a, pre, germanic, form, uoh, t, s, which, is, related, to, the, proto, celtic, terms, w, tis, meaning, seer, sooth, sayer, cf, gaulish, w, teis, old, irish, f, ith, prophet, and, w, tus, meaning, prophesy, poetic, inspiration, cf, old, irish, f, th, prophetic, wisdom, maxims, old, welsh, guaut, prophetic, verse, panegyric, according, to, some, scholars, the, latin, term, v, t, s, prophet, seer, is, probably, a, celtic, loanword, from, the, gaulish, language, making, uoh, t, s, ueh, tus, god, inspired, a, shared, religious, term, common, to, germanic, and, celtic, rather, than, an, inherited, word, of, earlier, proto, indo, european, pie, origin, in, the, case, a, borrowing, scenario, is, excluded, a, pie, etymon, h, ueh, tis, prophet, seer, can, also, be, posited, as, the, common, ancestor, of, the, attested, germanic, celtic, and, latin, forms, more, than, 170, names, are, recorded, for, odin, the, names, are, variously, descriptive, of, attributes, of, the, god, refer, to, myths, involving, him, or, refer, to, religious, practices, associated, with, him, this, multitude, makes, odin, the, god, with, the, most, known, names, among, the, germanic, peoples, professor, steve, martin, has, pointed, out, that, the, name, odinsberg, ounesberry, ounsberry, othenburgh, in, cleveland, yorkshire, now, corrupted, to, roseberry, topping, may, derive, from, the, time, of, the, anglian, settlements, with, nearby, newton, under, roseberry, and, great, ayton, having, anglo, saxon, suffixes, the, very, dramatic, rocky, peak, was, an, obvious, place, for, divine, association, and, may, have, replaced, bronze, age, iron, age, beliefs, of, divinity, there, given, that, a, hoard, of, bronze, votive, axes, and, other, objects, was, buried, by, the, summit, it, could, be, a, rare, example, then, of, nordic, germanic, theology, displacing, earlier, celtic, mythology, in, an, imposing, place, of, tribal, prominence, in, his, opera, cycle, der, ring, des, nibelungen, richard, wagner, refers, to, the, god, as, wotan, a, spelling, of, his, own, invention, which, combines, the, old, high, german, wuotan, with, the, low, german, wodan, the, modern, english, weekday, name, wednesday, derives, from, old, english, w, dnesd, g, meaning, day, of, w, den, cognate, terms, are, found, in, other, germanic, languages, such, as, middle, low, german, and, middle, dutch, w, densdach, modern, dutch, woensdag, old, frisian, w, rnisdei, w, rendei, and, old, norse, insdagr, cf, danish, norwegian, swedish, onsdag, all, of, these, terms, derive, from, late, proto, germanic, wodanesdag, day, of, w, anaz, a, calque, of, latin, mercurii, dies, day, of, mercury, cf, modern, italian, mercoled, french, mercredi, spanish, mi, rcoles, the, earliest, records, of, the, germanic, peoples, were, recorded, by, the, romans, and, in, these, works, odin, is, frequently, referred, to, via, a, process, known, as, interpretatio, romana, where, characteristics, perceived, to, be, similar, by, romans, result, in, identification, of, a, non, roman, god, as, a, roman, deity, as, the, roman, god, mercury, the, first, clear, example, of, this, occurs, in, the, roman, historian, tacitus, s, late, 1st, century, work, germania, where, writing, about, the, religion, of, the, suebi, a, confederation, of, germanic, peoples, he, comments, that, among, the, gods, mercury, is, the, one, they, principally, worship, they, regard, it, as, a, religious, duty, to, offer, to, him, on, fixed, days, human, as, well, as, other, sacrificial, victims, hercules, and, mars, they, appease, by, animal, offerings, of, the, permitted, kind, and, adds, that, a, portion, of, the, suebi, also, venerate, isis, in, this, instance, tacitus, refers, to, the, god, odin, as, mercury, thor, as, hercules, and, t, r, as, mars, the, isis, of, the, suebi, has, been, debated, and, may, represent, freyja, anthony, birley, noted, that, odin, s, apparent, identification, with, mercury, has, little, to, do, with, mercury, s, classical, role, of, being, messenger, of, the, gods, but, appears, to, be, due, to, mercury, s, role, of, psychopomp, other, contemporary, evidence, may, also, have, led, to, the, equation, of, odin, with, mercury, odin, like, mercury, may, have, at, this, time, already, been, pictured, with, a, staff, and, hat, may, have, been, considered, a, trader, god, and, the, two, may, have, been, seen, as, parallel, in, their, roles, as, wandering, deities, but, their, rankings, in, their, respective, religious, spheres, may, have, been, very, different, also, tacitus, s, among, the, gods, mercury, is, the, one, they, principally, worship, is, an, exact, quote, from, julius, caesar, s, commentarii, de, bello, gallico, 1st, century, bce, in, which, caesar, is, referring, to, the, gauls, and, not, the, germanic, peoples, regarding, the, germanic, peoples, caesar, states, hey, consider, the, gods, only, the, ones, that, they, can, see, the, sun, fire, and, the, moon, which, scholars, reject, as, clearly, mistaken, regardless, of, what, may, have, led, to, the, statement, there, is, no, direct, undisputed, evidence, for, the, worship, of, odin, mercury, among, the, goths, and, the, existence, of, a, cult, of, odin, among, them, is, debated, richard, north, and, herwig, wolfram, have, both, argued, that, the, goths, did, not, worship, odin, wolfram, contending, that, the, use, of, greek, names, of, the, week, in, gothic, provides, evidence, of, that, one, possible, reading, of, the, gothic, ring, of, pietroassa, is, that, the, inscription, gutaniowi, hailag, means, sacred, to, wodan, jove, but, this, is, highly, disputed, the, earliest, clear, reference, to, odin, by, name, is, found, on, a, c, bracteate, discovered, in, denmark, in, 2020, dated, to, as, early, as, the, 400s, the, bracteate, features, a, proto, norse, elder, futhark, inscription, reading, he, is, odin, s, man, iz, w, d, nas, weraz, although, the, english, kingdoms, were, converted, to, christianity, by, the, 7th, century, woden, is, frequently, listed, as, a, founding, figure, among, the, old, english, royalty, odin, is, also, either, directly, or, indirectly, mentioned, a, few, times, in, the, surviving, old, english, poetic, corpus, including, the, nine, herbs, charm, and, likely, also, the, old, english, rune, poem, odin, may, also, be, referenced, in, the, riddle, solomon, and, saturn, in, the, nine, herbs, charm, woden, is, said, to, have, slain, a, wyrm, serpent, germanic, dragon, by, way, of, nine, glory, twigs, preserved, from, an, 11th, century, manuscript, the, poem, is, according, to, bill, griffiths, one, of, the, most, enigmatic, of, old, english, texts, the, section, that, mentions, woden, is, as, follows, wyrm, com, snican, toslat, he, nan, a, genam, woden, viiii, wuldortanas, sloh, a, a, n, ddran, t, heo, on, viiii, tofleah, r, ga, ndade, ppel, and, attor, t, heo, n, fre, ne, wolde, on, hus, bugan, a, serpent, came, crawling, but, it, destroyed, no, one, when, woden, took, nine, twigs, of, glory, and, then, struck, the, adder, so, that, it, flew, into, nine, pieces, there, archived, apple, and, poison, that, it, never, would, re, enter, the, house, the, emendation, of, nan, to, man, has, been, proposed, the, next, stanza, comments, on, the, creation, of, the, herbs, chervil, and, fennel, while, hanging, in, heaven, by, the, wise, lord, witig, drihten, and, before, sending, them, down, among, mankind, regarding, this, griffith, comments, that, in, a, christian, context, hanging, in, heaven, would, refer, to, the, crucifixion, but, remembering, that, woden, was, mentioned, a, few, lines, previously, there, is, also, a, parallel, perhaps, a, better, one, with, odin, as, his, crucifixion, was, associated, with, learning, the, old, english, gnomic, poem, maxims, i, also, mentions, woden, by, name, in, the, alliterative, phrase, woden, worhte, weos, woden, made, idols, in, which, he, is, contrasted, with, and, denounced, against, the, christian, god, the, old, english, rune, poem, recounts, the, old, english, runic, alphabet, the, futhorc, the, stanza, for, the, rune, s, reads, as, follows, s, by, ordfruma, lcre, spr, ce, w, sd, mes, wra, u, and, w, tena, fr, fur, and, eorla, gehw, m, adnys, and, t, hiht, god, is, the, origin, of, all, language, wisdom, s, foundation, and, wise, man, s, comfort, and, to, every, hero, blessing, and, hope, the, first, word, of, this, stanza, s, latin, mouth, is, a, homophone, for, old, english, os, a, particularly, heathen, word, for, god, due, to, this, and, the, content, of, the, stanzas, several, scholars, have, posited, that, this, poem, is, censored, having, originally, referred, to, odin, kathleen, herbert, comments, that, os, was, cognate, with, as, in, norse, where, it, meant, one, of, the, sir, the, chief, family, of, gods, in, old, english, it, could, be, used, as, an, element, in, first, names, osric, oswald, osmund, etc, but, it, was, not, used, as, a, word, to, refer, to, the, god, of, christians, woden, was, equated, with, mercury, the, god, of, eloquence, among, other, things, the, tales, about, the, norse, god, odin, tell, how, he, gave, one, of, his, eyes, in, return, for, wisdom, he, also, won, the, mead, of, poetic, inspiration, luckily, for, christian, rune, masters, the, latin, word, os, could, be, substituted, without, ruining, the, sense, to, keep, the, outward, form, of, the, rune, name, without, obviously, referring, to, woden, in, the, prose, narrative, of, solomon, and, saturn, mercurius, the, giant, mercurius, se, gygand, is, referred, to, as, an, inventor, of, letters, this, may, also, be, a, reference, to, odin, who, is, in, norse, mythology, the, founder, of, the, runic, alphabets, and, the, gloss, a, continuation, of, the, practice, of, equating, odin, with, mercury, found, as, early, as, tacitus, one, of, the, solomon, and, saturn, poems, is, additionally, in, the, style, of, later, old, norse, material, featuring, odin, such, as, the, old, norse, poem, vaf, r, nism, l, featuring, odin, and, the, j, tunn, vaf, r, nir, engaging, in, a, deadly, game, of, wits, the, 7th,

ybor, and, aio, the, vandals, ruled, by, ambri, and, assi, came, to, the, winnili, with, their, army, and, demanded, that, they, pay, them, tribute, or, prepare, for, war, ybor, aio, and, their, mother, gambara, rejected, their, demands, for, tribute, ambri, and, assi, then, asked, the, god, godan, for, victory, over, the, winnili, to, which, godan, responded, in, the, longer, version, in, the, origo, whom, i, shall, first, see, when, at, sunrise, to, them, will, i, give, the, victory, meanwhile, ybor, and, aio, called, upon, frea, godan, s, wife, frea, counselled, them, that, at, sunrise, the, winnil, should, come, and, that, their, women, with, their, hair, let, down, around, the, face, in, the, likeness, of, a, beard, should, also, come, with, their, husbands, at, sunrise,

the, old, still, live, in, the, mouths, of, the, people, thorpe, notes, that, in, blekinge, in, sweden, it, was, formerly, the, custom, to, leave, a, sheaf, on, the, field, for, odin, s, horses, and, cites, other, examples, such, as, in, kr, ktorpsg, rd, sm, land, where, a, barrow, was, purported, to, have, been, opened, in, the, 18th, century, purportedly, containing, the, body, of, odin, after, christianization, the, mound, was, known, as, helvetesbackke, swedish, hell, s, mound, local, legend, dictates, that, after, it, was, opened, there, burst, forth, a, wondrous, fire, like, a, flash, of, lightning, and, that, a, coffin, full, of, flint, and, a, lamp, were, excavated, thorpe, additionally, relates, that, legend, has, it, that, a, priest, who, dwelt, around, troienborg, had, once, sowed, some, rye, and, that, when, the, rye, sprang, up, so, came, odin, riding, from, the, hills, each, evening, odin, was, so, massive, that, he, towered, over, the, farm, yard, buildings, spear, in, hand, halting, before, the, entry, way, he, kept, all, from, entering, or, leaving, all, night, which, occurred, every, night, until, the, rye, was, cut, thorpe, relates, that, a, story, is, also, current, of, a, golden, ship, which, is, said, to, be, sunk, in, runemad, near, the, nyckelberg, in, which, according, to, tradition, odin, fetched, the, slain, from, the, battle, of, br, valla, to, valhall, and, that, kettils, s, according, to, legend, derives, its, name, from, one, ketill, runske, who, stole, odin, s, runic, staves, runekaflar, and, then, bound, odin, s, dogs, bull, and, a,

birds, the, presence, of, the, birds, has, led, to, the, iconographic, identification, of, the, human, figure, as, the, god, odin, flanked, by, huginn, and, muninn, like, the, prose, edda, description, of, the, ravens, a, bird, is, sometimes, depicted, at, the, ear, of, the, human, or, at, the, ear, of, the, horse, bracteates, have, been, found, in, denmark, sweden, norway, and, in, smaller, numbers, england, and, areas, south, of, denmark, austrian, germanist, rudolf, simek, states, that, these, bracteates, may, depict, odin, and, his, ravens, healing, a, horse, and, may, indicate, that, the, birds, were, originally, not, simply, his, battlefield, companions, but, also, odin, s, helpers, in, his, veterinary, function, vendel, period, helmet, plates, from, the, 6th, or, 7th, century, found, in, a, grave, in, sweden, depict, a, helmeted, figure, holding, a, spear, and, a, shield, while, riding, a, horse, flanked, by, two, birds, the, plate, has, been, interpreted, as, odin, accompanied, by, two, birds, his, ravens, two, of, the, 8th, century, picture, stones, from, the, island, of, gotland, sweden, depict, eight, legged, horses, which, are, thought, by, most, scholars, to, depict, sleipnir, the, tj, ngvide, image, stone, and, the, ardre, viii, image, stone, both, stones, feature, a, rider, sitting, atop, an, eight, legged, horse, which, some, scholars, view, as, odin, above, the, rider, on, the, tj, ngvide, image, stone, is, a, horizontal, figure, holding, a, spear, which, may, be, a, valkyrie, and, a, female, figure, greets, the, rider, with, a, cup, the, scene, has, been, interpreted, as, a, rider, arriving, at, the, world, of, the, dead, the, mid, 7th, century, eggja, stone, bearing, the, odinic, name, haras, old, norse, army, god, may, be, interpreted, as, depicting, sleipnir, a, pair, of, identical, germanic, iron, age, bird, shaped, brooches, from, bejsebakke, in, northern, denmark, may, be, depictions, of, huginn, and, muninn, the, back, of, each, bird, features, a, mask, motif, and, the, feet, of, the, birds, are, shaped, like, the, heads, of, animals, the, feathers, of, the, birds, are, also, composed, of, animal, heads, together, the, animal, heads, on, the, feathers, form, a, mask, on, the, back, of, the, bird, the, birds, have, powerful, beaks, and, fan, shaped, tails, indicating, that, they, are, ravens, the, brooches, were, intended, to, be, worn, on, each, shoulder, after, germanic, iron, age, fashion, archaeologist, peter, vang, petersen, comments, that, while, the, symbolism, of, the, brooches, is, open, to, debate, the, shape, of, the, beaks, and, tail, feathers, confirms, the, brooch, depictions, are, ravens, petersen, notes, that, raven, shaped, ornaments, worn, as, a, pair, after, the, fashion, of, the, day, one, on, each, shoulder, makes, one, s, thoughts, turn, towards, odin, s, ravens, and, the, cult, of, odin, in, the, germanic, iron, age, petersen, says, that, odin, is, associated, with, disguise, and, that, the, masks, on, the, ravens, may, be, portraits, of, odin, the, oseberg, tapestry, fragments, discovered, within, the, viking, age, oseberg, ship, burial, in, norway, features, a, scene, containing, two, black, birds, hovering, over, a, horse, possibly, originally, leading, a, wagon, as, a, part, of, a, procession, of, horse, led, wagons, on, the, tapestry, in, her, examination, of, the, tapestry, scholar, anne, stine, ingstad, interprets, these, birds, as, huginn, and, muninn, flying, over, a, covered, cart, containing, an, image, of, odin, drawing, comparison, to, the, images, of, nerthus, attested, by, tacitus, in, 1, ce, excavations, in, ribe, denmark, have, recovered, a, viking, age, lead, metal, caster, s, mould, and, 11, identical, casting, moulds, these, objects, depict, a, moustached, man, wearing, a, helmet, that, features, two, head, ornaments, archaeologist, stig, jensen, proposes, these, head, ornaments, should, be, interpreted, as, huginn, and, muninn, and, the, wearer, as, odin, he, notes, that, similar, depictions, occur, everywhere, the, vikings, went, from, eastern, england, to, russia, and, naturally, also, in, the, rest, of, scandinavia, a, portion, of, thorwald, s, cross, a, partly, surviving, runestone, erected, at, kirk, andreas, on, the, isle, of, man, depicts, a, bearded, human, holding, a, spear, downward, at, a, wolf, his, right, foot, in, its, mouth, and, a, large, bird, on, his, shoulder, andy, orchard, comments, that, this, bird, may, be, either, huginn, or, muninn, rundata, dates, the, cross, to, 940, while, pluskowski, dates, it, to, the, 11th, century, this, depiction, has, been, interpreted, as, odin, with, a, raven, or, eagle, at, his, shoulder, being, consumed, by, the, monstrous, wolf, fenrir, during, the, events, of, ragnar, k, the, 11th, century, ledberg, stone, in, sweden, similarly, to, thorwald, s, cross, features, a, figure, with, his, foot, at, the, mouth, of, a, four, legged, beast, and, this, may, also, be, a, depiction, of, odin, being, devoured, by, fenrir, at, ragnar, k, below, the, beast, and, the, man, is, a, depiction, of, a, legless, helmeted, man, with, his, arms, in, a, prostrate, position, the, younger, futhark, inscription, on, the, stone, bears, a, commonly, seen, memorial, dedication, but, is, followed, by, an, encoded, runic, sequence, that, has, been, described, as, mysterious, and, an, interesting, magic, formula, which, is, known, from, all, over, the, ancient, norse, world, in, november, 2009, the, roskilde, museum, announced, the, discovery, and, subsequent, display, of, a, niello, inlaid, silver, figurine, found, in, lejre, which, they, dubbed, odin, from, lejre, the, silver, object, depicts, a, person, sitting, on, a, throne, the, throne, features, the, heads, of, animals, and, is, flanked, by, two, birds, the, roskilde, museum, identifies, the, figure, as, odin, sitting, on, his, throne, hli, skj, lf, flanked, by, the, ravens, huginn, and, muninn, various, interpretations, have, been, offered, for, a, symbol, that, appears, on, various, archaeological, finds, known, modernly, as, the, valknut, due, to, the, context, of, its, placement, on, some, objects, some, scholars, have, interpreted, this, symbol, as, referring, to, odin, for, example, hilda, ellis, davidson, theorises, a, connection, between, the, valknut, the, god, odin, and, mental, binds, for, instance, beside, the, figure, of, odin, on, his, horse, shown, on, several, memorial, stones, there, is, a, kind, of, knot, depicted, called, the, valknut, related, to, the, triskele, this, is, thought, to, symbolize, the, power, of, the, god, to, bind, and, unbind, mentioned, in, the, poems, and, elsewhere, odin, had, the, power, to, lay, bonds, upon, the, mind, so, that, men, became, helpless, in, battle, and, he, could, also, loosen, the, tensions, of, fear, and, strain, by, his, gifts, of, battle, madness, intoxication, and, inspiration, davidson, says, that, similar, symbols, are, found, beside, figures, of, wolves, and, ravens, on, certain, cremation, urns, from, anglo, saxon, cemeteries, in, east, anglia, according, to, davidson, odin, s, connection, to, cremation, is, known, and, it, does, not, seem, unreasonable, to, connect, with, odin, in, anglo, saxon, england, davidson, proposes, further, connections, between, odin, s, role, as, bringer, of, ecstasy, by, way, of, the, etymology, of, the, god, s, name, beginning, with, henry, petersen, s, doctoral, dissertation, in, 1876, which, proposed, that, thor, was, the, indigenous, god, of, scandinavian, farmers, and, odin, a, later, god, proper, to, chieftains, and, poets, many, scholars, of, norse, mythology, in, the, past, viewed, odin, as, having, been, imported, from, elsewhere, the, idea, was, developed, by, bernhard, salin, on, the, basis, of, motifs, in, the, petroglyphs, and, bracteates, and, with, reference, to, the, prologue, of, the, prose, edda, which, presents, the, sir, as, having, migrated, into, scandinavia, salin, proposed, that, both, odin, and, the, runes, were, introduced, from, southeastern, europe, in, the, iron, age, other, scholars, placed, his, introduction, at, different, times, axel, olrik, during, the, migration, age, as, a, result, of, gaulish, influence, more, radically, both, the, archaeologist, and, comparative, mythologist, marija, gimbutas, and, the, germanicist, karl, helm, argued, that, the, sir, as, a, group, which, includes, both, thor, and, odin, were, late, introductions, into, northern, europe, and, that, the, indigenous, religion, of, the, region, had, been, vanic, in, the, 16th, century, and, by, the, entire, vasa, dynasty, odin, swedish, oden, was, officially, considered, the, first, king, of, sweden, by, that, country, s, government, and, historians, this, was, influenced, by, an, embellished, list, of, rulers, invented, by, johannes, magnus, under, the, trifunctional, hypothesis, of, georges, dum, zil, odin, is, assigned, one, of, the, core, functions, in, the, indo, european, pantheon, as, a, representative, of, the, first, function, sovereignty, corresponding, to, the, hindu, varu, a, fury, and, magic, as, opposed, to, t, r, who, corresponds, to, the, hindu, mitr, law, and, justice, while, the, vanir, represent, the, third, function, fertility, another, approach, to, odin, has, been, in, terms, of, his, function, and, attributes, many, early, scholars, interpreted, him, as, a, wind, god, or, especially, as, a, death, god, he, has, also, been, interpreted, in, the, light, of, his, association, with, ecstatic, practices, and, jan, de, vries, compared, him, to, the, hindu, god, rudra, and, the, greek, hermes, the, god, odin, has, been, a, source, of, inspiration, for, artists, working, in, fine, art, literature, and, music, fine, art, depictions, of, odin, in, the, modern, period, include, the, pen, and, ink, drawing, odin, byggande, sigtuna, 1812, and, the,
