philosophy, of, mathematics, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, that, deals, with, the, nature, of, mathematics, and, its, relationship, with, other, human, activities, major, themes, that, are, dealt, with, in, philosophy, of, mathematics, include, the, connection, between, mathematics, and, material, reality, has, led, to, philosophical, debates, since, at, least, the, time, of, pythagoras, the, ancient, philosopher, plato, argued, that, abstractions, that, reflect, material, reality, have, themselves, a, reality, that, exists, outside, space, and, time, as, a, result, the, philosophical, view, that, mathematical, objects, somehow, exist, on, their, own, in, abstraction, is, often, referred, to, as, platonism, independently, of, their, possible, philosophical, opinions, modern, mathematicians, may, be, generally, considered, as, platonists, since, they, think, of, and, talk, of, their, objects, of, study, as, real, objects, see, mathematical, object, armand, borel, summarized, this, view, of, mathematics, reality, as, follows, and, provided, quotations, of, g, h, hardy, charles, hermite, henri, poincar, and, albert, einstein, that, support, his, views, something, becomes, objective, as, opposed, to, subjective, as, soon, as, we, are, convinced, that, it, exists, in, the, minds, of, others, in, the, same, form, as, it, does, in, ours, and, that, we, can, think, about, it, and, discuss, it, together, because, the, language, of, mathematics, is, so, precise, it, is, ideally, suited, to, defining, concepts, for, which, such, a, consensus, exists, in, my, opinion, that, is, sufficient, to, provide, us, with, a, feeling, of, an, objective, existence, of, a, reality, of, mathematics, mathematical, reasoning, requires, rigor, this, means, that, the, definitions, must, be, absolutely, unambiguous, and, the, proofs, must, be, reducible, to, a, succession, of, applications, of, syllogisms, or, inference, rules, without, any, use, of, empirical, evidence, and, intuition, the, rules, of, rigorous, reasoning, have, been, established, by, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, under, the, name, of, logic, logic, is, not, specific, to, mathematics, but, in, mathematics, the, standard, of, rigor, is, much, higher, than, elsewhere, for, many, centuries, logic, although, used, for, mathematical, proofs, belonged, to, philosophy, and, was, not, specifically, studied, by, mathematicians, circa, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, several, paradoxes, made, questionable, the, logical, foundation, of, mathematics, and, consequently, the, validity, of, the, whole, mathematics, this, has, been, called, the, foundational, crisis, of, mathematics, some, of, these, paradoxes, consist, of, results, that, seem, to, contradict, the, common, intuition, such, as, the, possibility, to, construct, valid, non, euclidean, geometries, in, which, the, parallel, postulate, is, wrong, the, weierstrass, function, that, is, continuous, but, nowhere, differentiable, and, the, study, by, georg, cantor, of, infinite, sets, which, led, to, consider, several, sizes, of, infinity, infinite, cardinals, even, more, striking, russell, s, paradox, shows, that, the, phrase, the, set, of, all, sets, is, self, contradictory, several, methods, have, been, proposed, to, solve, the, problem, by, changing, of, logical, framework, such, as, constructive, mathematics, and, intuitionistic, logic, roughly, speaking, the, first, one, consists, of, requiring, that, every, existence, theorem, must, provide, an, explicit, example, and, the, second, one, excludes, from, mathematical, reasoning, the, law, of, excluded, middle, and, double, negation, elimination, the, problems, of, foundation, of, mathematics, has, been, eventually, resolved, with, the, rise, of, mathematical, logic, as, a, new, area, of, mathematics, in, this, framework, a, mathematical, or, logical, theory, consists, of, a, formal, language, that, defines, the, well, formed, of, assertions, a, set, of, basic, assertions, called, axioms, and, a, set, of, inference, rules, that, allow, producing, new, assertions, from, one, or, several, known, assertions, a, theorem, of, such, a, theory, is, either, an, axiom, or, an, assertion, that, can, be, obtained, from, previously, known, theorems, by, the, application, of, an, inference, rule, the, zermelo, fraenkel, set, theory, with, the, axiom, of, choice, generally, called, zfc, is, such, a, theory, in, which, all, mathematics, have, been, restated, it, is, used, implicitely, in, all, mathematics, texts, that, do, not, specify, explicitly, on, which, foundations, they, are, based, moreover, the, other, proposed, foundations, can, be, modeled, and, studied, inside, zfc, it, results, that, rigor, is, no, more, a, relevant, concept, in, mathematics, as, a, proof, is, either, correct, or, erroneous, and, a, rigorous, proof, is, simply, a, pleonasm, where, a, special, concept, of, rigor, comes, into, play, is, in, the, socialized, aspects, of, a, proof, in, particular, proofs, are, rarely, written, in, full, details, and, some, steps, of, a, proof, are, generally, considered, as, trivial, easy, or, straightforward, and, therefore, left, to, the, reader, as, most, proof, errors, occur, in, these, skipped, steps, a, new, proof, requires, to, be, verified, by, other, specialists, of, the, subject, and, can, be, considered, as, reliable, only, after, having, been, accepted, by, the, community, of, the, specialists, which, may, need, several, years, also, the, concept, of, rigor, may, remain, useful, for, teaching, to, beginners, what, is, a, mathematical, proof, before, the, 19th, century, the, basic, mathematical, concepts, such, as, points, lines, natural, numbers, real, numbers, used, for, measurements, etc, were, abstractions, from, the, physical, world, and, it, was, commonly, considered, that, it, was, sufficient, for, defining, them, as, a, consequence, of, this, closeness, to, physical, reality, mathematicians, were, very, cautious, when, problems, they, want, to, solve, led, them, to, introduce, new, concepts, that, are, not, directly, related, the, real, world, these, precautions, are, still, reflected, in, modern, terminology, where, the, numbers, that, are, not, quotient, of, natural, numbers, are, called, irrational, numbers, originally, meaning, that, reason, cannot, conceive, them, similarly, real, numbers, are, the, numbers, that, can, be, used, for, measurement, while, imaginary, numbers, cannot, during, the, 19th, century, there, were, an, active, research, for, giving, more, precise, definitions, to, the, basic, concepts, resulting, of, abstraction, from, the, real, world, for, example, peano, arithmetic, for, natural, numbers, the, formal, definitions, of, limit, series, infinite, sums, that, may, have, a, finite, value, and, continuity, by, cauchy, and, weierstrass, the, definition, of, real, numbers, by, cauchy, and, dedekind, these, formal, definitions, allowed, to, prove, counterintuitive, results, which, are, a, part, of, the, origin, of, the, foundational, crisis, of, mathematics, for, example, weierstrass, function, is, a, function, that, is, everywhere, continuous, and, nowhere, differentiable, since, the, existence, of, such, a, monster, seemed, impossible, people, had, two, choices, either, they, accept, such, unrealistic, facts, which, implies, that, mathematics, does, not, need, to, reflect, the, physical, reality, or, they, changes, the, logical, rules, for, excluding, such, monsters, the, first, choice, led, to, the, philosophical, school, of, formalism, in, its, strong, form, this, school, may, be, understood, as, the, fact, that, mathematicians, must, not, take, care, of, the, physical, reality, the, second, choice, led, to, intuitionism, and, constructivism, after, strong, debates, axiomatic, approach, became, eventually, a, de, facto, norm, in, mathematics, this, mean, that, mathematical, theories, must, be, based, on, axioms, basic, assumptions, that, are, considered, as, true, and, a, fixed, set, of, inference, rules, the, theory, consists, of, the, results, theorems, that, can, be, deduced, proved, from, the, axiom, by, using, inference, rules, and, inference, rules, only, the, entities, mathematical, objects, involved, in, the, axioms, are, considered, as, defined, by, the, axioms, and, nothing, else, is, supposed, on, their, nature, for, example, plane, geometry, can, be, axiomatized, with, two, sorts, of, objects, the, points, and, the, lines, and, a, relation, belonging, to, or, passing, through, that, relates, points, and, lines, one, of, the, axioms, is, there, is, exactly, one, line, that, passes, through, two, points, the, interpretation, of, points, and, lines, of, the, theory, as, usual, points, and, lines, does, not, matter, at, all, for, the, validity, of, the, theory, this, means, that, one, can, verify, the, correctness, of, a, proof, without, referring, to, any, figure, and, that, a, proved, theorem, remains, true, independently, of, any, interpretation, of, the, entities, involved, in, the, axioms, for, example, in, plane, projective, geometry, one, may, interpret, points, as, lines, and, vice, versa, this, implies, that, for, every, theorem, relating, points, and, lines, one, gets, immediately, a, new, theorem, by, exchanging, the, role, of, the, points, and, the, lines, see, duality, nevertheless, the, interpretation, of, the, objects, of, a, theory, in, terms, of, physical, reality, when, possible, or, of, previously, studied, abstractions, remains, fundamental, for, guiding, the, choice, of, the, axioms, understanding, the, subject, of, the, theory, and, follow, the, steps, of, a, long, proof, this, axiomatic, approach, has, been, applied, to, the, whole, mathematics, through, zfc, the, zermelo, fraenkel, set, theory, with, the, axiom, of, choice, the, whole, mathematics, has, been, rebuilt, inside, this, theory, except, if, the, contrary, is, explicitly, stated, all, modern, mathematical, texts, use, it, as, a, foundation, of, mathematics, as, a, consequence, the, relationship, between, mathematics, and, physical, reality, is, no, more, a, mathematical, question, but, the, nature, of, this, relationship, remains, a, philosophical, question, that, does, not, have, any, uncontroversial, answer, mathematics, is, used, in, most, sciences, for, modeling, phenomena, which, then, allows, predictions, to, be, made, from, experimental, laws, the, independence, of, mathematical, truth, from, any, experimentation, implies, that, the, accuracy, of, such, predictions, depends, only, on, the, adequacy, of, the, model, inaccurate, predictions, rather, than, being, caused, by, invalid, mathematical, concepts, imply, the, need, to, change, the, mathematical, model, used, for, example, the, perihelion, precession, of, mercury, could, only, be, explained, after, the, emergence, of, einstein, s, general, relativity, which, replaced, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, as, a, better, mathematical, model, there, is, still, a, philosophical, debate, whether, mathematics, is, a, science, however, in, practice, mathematicians, are, typically, grouped, with, scientists, and, mathematics, shares, much, in, common, with, the, physical, sciences, like, them, it, is, falsifiable, which, means, in, mathematics, that, if, a, result, or, a, theory, is, wrong, this, can, be, proved, by, providing, a, counterexample, similarly, as, in, science, theories, and, results, theorems, are, often, obtained, from, experimentation, in, mathematics, the, experimentation, may, consist, of, computation, on, selected, examples, or, of, the, study, of, figures, or, other, representations, of, mathematical, objects, often, mind, representations, without, physical, support, for, example, when, asked, how, he, came, about, his, theorems, gauss, once, replied, durch, planm, ssiges, tattonieren, through, systematic, experimentation, however, some, authors, emphasize, that, mathematics, differs, from, the, modern, notion, of, science, by, not, relying, on, empirical, evidence, the, unreasonable, effectiveness, of, mathematics, is, a, phenomenon, that, was, named, and, first, made, explicit, by, physicist, eugene, wigner, it, is, the, fact, that, many, mathematical, theories, even, the, purest, have, applications, outside, their, initial, object, these, applications, may, be, completely, outside, their, initial, area, of, mathematics, and, may, concern, physical, phenomena, that, were, completely, unknown, when, the, mathematical, theory, was, introduced, examples, of, unexpected, applications, of, mathematical, theories, can, be, found, in, many, areas, of, mathematics, a, notable, example, is, the, prime, factorization, of, natural, numbers, that, was, discovered, more, than, 2, 000, years, before, its, common, use, for, secure, internet, communications, through, the, rsa, cryptosystem, a, second, historical, example, is, the, theory, of, ellipses, they, were, studied, by, the, ancient, greek, mathematicians, as, conic, sections, that, is, intersections, of, cones, with, planes, it, is, almost, 2, 000, years, later, that, johannes, kepler, discovered, that, the, trajectories, of, the, planets, are, ellipses, in, the, 19th, century, the, internal, development, of, geometry, pure, mathematics, led, to, definition, and, study, of, non, euclidean, geometries, spaces, of, dimension, higher, than, three, and, manifolds, at, this, time, these, concepts, seemed, totally, disconnected, from, the, physical, reality, but, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, albert, einstein, developed, the, theory, of, relativity, that, uses, fundamentally, these, concepts, in, particular, spacetime, of, special, relativity, is, a, non, euclidean, space, of, dimension, four, and, spacetime, of, general, relativity, is, a, curved, manifold, of, dimension, four, a, striking, aspect, of, the, interaction, between, mathematics, and, physics, is, when, mathematics, drives, research, in, physics, this, is, illustrated, by, the, discoveries, of, the, positron, and, the, baryon, displaystyle, omega, in, both, cases, the, equations, of, the, theories, had, unexplained, solutions, which, led, to, conjecture, of, the, existence, of, an, unknown, particle, and, the, search, for, these, particles, in, both, cases, these, particles, were, discovered, a, few, years, later, by, specific, experiments, the, origin, of, mathematics, is, of, arguments, and, disagreements, whether, the, birth, of, mathematics, was, by, chance, or, induced, by, necessity, during, the, development, of, similar, subjects, such, as, physics, remains, an, area, of, contention, many, thinkers, have, contributed, their, ideas, concerning, the, nature, of, mathematics, today, some, philosophers, of, mathematics, aim, to, give, accounts, of, this, form, of, inquiry, and, its, products, as, they, stand, while, others, emphasize, a, role, for, themselves, that, goes, beyond, simple, interpretation, to, critical, analysis, there, are, traditions, of, mathematical, philosophy, in, both, western, philosophy, and, eastern, philosophy, western, philosophies, of, mathematics, go, as, far, back, as, pythagoras, who, described, the, theory, everything, is, mathematics, mathematicism, plato, who, paraphrased, pythagoras, and, studied, the, ontological, status, of, mathematical, objects, and, aristotle, who, studied, logic, and, issues, related, to, infinity, actual, versus, potential, greek, philosophy, on, mathematics, was, strongly, influenced, by, their, study, of, geometry, for, example, at, one, time, the, greeks, held, the, opinion, that, 1, one, was, not, a, number, but, rather, a, unit, of, arbitrary, length, a, number, was, defined, as, a, multitude, therefore, 3, for, example, represented, a, certain, multitude, of, units, and, was, thus, truly, a, number, at, another, point, a, similar, argument, was, made, that, 2, was, not, a, number, but, a, fundamental, notion, of, a, pair, these, views, come, from, the, heavily, geometric, straight, edge, and, compass, viewpoint, of, the, greeks, just, as, lines, drawn, in, a, geometric, problem, are, measured, in, proportion, to, the, first, arbitrarily, drawn, line, so, too, are, the, numbers, on, a, number, line, measured, in, proportion, to, the, arbitrary, first, number, or, one, these, earlier, greek, ideas, of, numbers, were, later, upended, by, the, discovery, of, the, irrationality, of, the, square, root, of, two, hippasus, a, disciple, of, pythagoras, showed, that, the, diagonal, of, a, unit, square, was, incommensurable, with, its, unit, length, edge, in, other, words, he, proved, there, was, no, existing, rational, number, that, accurately, depicts, the, proportion, of, the, diagonal, of, the, unit, square, to, its, edge, this, caused, a, significant, re, evaluation, of, greek, philosophy, of, mathematics, according, to, legend, fellow, pythagoreans, were, so, traumatized, by, this, discovery, that, they, murdered, hippasus, to, stop, him, from, spreading, his, heretical, idea, simon, stevin, was, one, of, the, first, in, europe, to, challenge, greek, ideas, in, the, 16th, century, beginning, with, leibniz, the, focus, shifted, strongly, to, the, relationship, between, mathematics, and, logic, this, perspective, dominated, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, through, the, time, of, frege, and, of, russell, but, was, brought, into, question, by, developments, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, a, perennial, issue, in, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, concerns, the, relationship, between, logic, and, mathematics, at, their, joint, foundations, while, 20th, century, philosophers, continued, to, ask, the, questions, mentioned, at, the, outset, of, this, article, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, in, the, 20th, century, was, characterized, by, a, predominant, interest, in, formal, logic, set, theory, both, naive, set, theory, and, axiomatic, set, theory, and, foundational, issues, it, is, a, profound, puzzle, that, on, the, one, hand, mathematical, truths, seem, to, have, a, compelling, inevitability, but, on, the, other, hand, the, source, of, their, truthfulness, remains, elusive, investigations, into, this, issue, are, known, as, the, foundations, of, mathematics, program, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, philosophers, of, mathematics, were, already, beginning, to, divide, into, various, schools, of, thought, about, all, these, questions, broadly, distinguished, by, their, pictures, of, mathematical, epistemology, and, ontology, three, schools, formalism, intuitionism, and, logicism, emerged, at, this, time, partly, in, response, to, the, increasingly, widespread, worry, that, mathematics, as, it, stood, and, analysis, in, particular, did, not, live, up, to, the, standards, of, certainty, and, rigor, that, had, been, taken, for, granted, each, school, addressed, the, issues, that, came, to, the, fore, at, that, time, either, attempting, to, resolve, them, or, claiming, that, mathematics, is, not, entitled, to, its, status, as, our, most, trusted, knowledge, surprising, and, counter, intuitive, developments, in, formal, logic, and, set, theory, early, in, the, 20th, century, led, to, new, questions, concerning, what, was, traditionally, called, the, foundations, of, mathematics, as, the, century, unfolded, the, initial, focus, of, concern, expanded, to, an, open, exploration, of, the, fundamental, axioms, of, mathematics, the, axiomatic, approach, having, been, taken, for, granted, since, the, time, of, euclid, around, 300, bce, as, the, natural, basis, for, mathematics, notions, of, axiom, proposition, and, proof, as, well, as, the, notion, of, a, proposition, being, true, of, a, mathematical, object, see, assignment, were, formalized, allowing, them, to, be, treated, mathematically, the, zermelo, fraenkel, axioms, for, set, theory, were, formulated, which, provided, a, conceptual, framework, in, which, much, mathematical, discourse, would, be, interpreted, in, mathematics, as, in, physics, new, and, unexpected, ideas, had, arisen, and, significant, changes, were, coming, with, g, del, numbering, propositions, could, be, interpreted, as, referring, to, themselves, or, other, propositions, enabling, inquiry, into, the, consistency, of, mathematical, theories, this, reflective, critique, in, which, the, theory, under, review, becomes, itself, the, object, of, a, mathematical, study, led, hilbert, to, call, such, study, metamathematics, or, proof, theory, at, the, middle, of, the, century, a, new, mathematical, theory, was, created, by, samuel, eilenberg, and, saunders, mac, lane, known, as, category, theory, and, it, became, a, new, contender, for, the, natural, language, of, mathematical, thinking, as, the, 20th, century, progressed, however, philosophical, opinions, diverged, as, to, just, how, well, founded, were, the, questions, about, foundations, that, were, raised, at, the, century, s, beginning, hilary, putnam, summed, up, one, common, view, of, the, situation, in, the, last, third, of, the, century, by, saying, when, philosophy, discovers, something, wrong, with, science, sometimes, science, has, to, be, changed, russell, s, paradox, comes, to, mind, as, does, berkeley, s, attack, on, the, actual, infinitesimal, but, more, often, it, is, philosophy, that, has, to, be, changed, i, do, not, think, that, the, difficulties, that, philosophy, finds, with, classical, mathematics, today, are, genuine, difficulties, and, i, think, that, the, philosophical, interpretations, of, mathematics, that, we, are, being, offered, on, every, hand, are, wrong, and, that, philosophical, interpretation, is, just, what, mathematics, doesn, t, need, 169, 170, philosophy, of, mathematics, today, proceeds, along, several, different, lines, of, inquiry, by, philosophers, of, mathematics, logicians, and, mathematicians, and, there, are, many, schools, of, thought, on, the, subject, the, schools, are, addressed, separately, in, the, next, section, and, their, assumptions, explained, the, view, that, claims, that, mathematics, is, the, aesthetic, combination, of, assumptions, and, then, also, claims, that, mathematics, is, an, art, a, famous, mathematician, who, claims, that, is, the, british, g, h, hardy, for, hardy, in, his, book, a, mathematician, s, apology, the, definition, of, mathematics, was, more, like, the, aesthetic, combination, of, concepts, mathematical, platonism, is, the, form, of, realism, that, suggests, that, mathematical, entities, are, abstract, have, no, spatiotemporal, or, causal, properties, and, are, eternal, and, unchanging, this, is, often, claimed, to, be, the, view, most, people, have, of, numbers, the, term, platonism, is, used, because, such, a, view, is, seen, to, parallel, plato, s, theory, of, forms, and, a, world, of, ideas, greek, eidos, described, in, plato, s, allegory, of, the, cave, the, everyday, world, can, only, imperfectly, approximate, an, unchanging, ultimate, reality, both, plato, s, cave, and, platonism, have, meaningful, not, just, superficial, connections, because, plato, s, ideas, were, preceded, and, probably, influenced, by, the, hugely, popular, pythagoreans, of, ancient, greece, who, believed, that, the, world, was, quite, literally, generated, by, numbers, a, major, question, considered, in, mathematical, platonism, is, precisely, where, and, how, do, the, mathematical, entities, exist, and, how, do, we, know, about, them, is, there, a, world, completely, separate, from, our, physical, one, that, is, occupied, by, the, mathematical, entities, how, can, we, gain, access, to, this, separate, world, and, discover, truths, about, the, entities, one, proposed, answer, is, the, ultimate, ensemble, a, theory, that, postulates, that, all, structures, that, exist, mathematically, also, exist, physically, in, their, own, universe, kurt, g, del, s, platonism, postulates, a, special, kind, of, mathematical, intuition, that, lets, us, perceive, mathematical, objects, directly, this, view, bears, resemblances, to, many, things, husserl, said, about, mathematics, and, supports, kant, s, idea, that, mathematics, is, synthetic, a, priori, davis, and, hersh, have, suggested, in, their, 1999, book, the, mathematical, experience, that, most, mathematicians, act, as, though, they, are, platonists, even, though, if, pressed, to, defend, the, position, carefully, they, may, retreat, to, formalism, full, blooded, platonism, is, a, modern, variation, of, platonism, which, is, in, reaction, to, the, fact, that, different, sets, of, mathematical, entities, can, be, proven, to, exist, depending, on, the, axioms, and, inference, rules, employed, for, instance, the, law, of, the, excluded, middle, and, the, axiom, of, choice, it, holds, that, all, mathematical, entities, exist, they, may, be, provable, even, if, they, cannot, all, be, derived, from, a, single, consistent, set, of, axioms, set, theoretic, realism, also, set, theoretic, platonism, a, position, defended, by, penelope, maddy, is, the, view, that, set, theory, is, about, a, single, universe, of, sets, this, position, which, is, also, known, as, naturalized, platonism, because, it, is, a, naturalized, version, of, mathematical, platonism, has, been, criticized, by, mark, balaguer, on, the, basis, of, paul, benacerraf, s, epistemological, problem, a, similar, view, termed, platonized, naturalism, was, later, defended, by, the, stanford, edmonton, school, according, to, this, view, a, more, traditional, kind, of, platonism, is, consistent, with, naturalism, the, more, traditional, kind, of, platonism, they, defend, is, distinguished, by, general, principles, that, assert, the, existence, of, abstract, objects, max, tegmark, s, mathematical, universe, hypothesis, or, mathematicism, goes, further, than, platonism, in, asserting, that, not, only, do, all, mathematical, objects, exist, but, nothing, else, does, tegmark, s, sole, postulate, is, all, structures, that, exist, mathematically, also, exist, physically, that, is, in, the, sense, that, in, those, complex, enough, to, contain, self, aware, substructures, will, subjectively, perceive, themselves, as, existing, in, a, physically, real, world, logicism, is, the, thesis, that, mathematics, is, reducible, to, logic, and, hence, nothing, but, a, part, of, logic, 41, logicists, hold, that, mathematics, can, be, known, a, priori, but, suggest, that, our, knowledge, of, mathematics, is, just, part, of, our, knowledge, of, logic, in, general, and, is, thus, analytic, not, requiring, any, special, faculty, of, mathematical, intuition, in, this, view, logic, is, the, proper, foundation, of, mathematics, and, all, mathematical, statements, are, necessary, logical, truths, rudolf, carnap, 1931, presents, the, logicist, thesis, in, two, parts, gottlob, frege, was, the, founder, of, logicism, in, his, seminal, die, grundgesetze, der, arithmetik, basic, laws, of, arithmetic, he, built, up, arithmetic, from, a, system, of, logic, with, a, general, principle, of, comprehension, which, he, called, basic, law, v, for, concepts, f, and, g, the, extension, of, f, equals, the, extension, of, g, if, and, only, if, for, all, objects, a, fa, equals, ga, a, principle, that, he, took, to, be, acceptable, as, part, of, logic, frege, s, construction, was, flawed, bertrand, russell, discovered, that, basic, law, v, is, inconsistent, this, is, russell, s, paradox, frege, abandoned, his, logicist, program, soon, after, this, but, it, was, continued, by, russell, and, whitehead, they, attributed, the, paradox, to, vicious, circularity, and, built, up, what, they, called, ramified, type, theory, to, deal, with, it, in, this, system, they, were, eventually, able, to, build, up, much, of, modern, mathematics, but, in, an, altered, and, excessively, complex, form, for, example, there, were, different, natural, numbers, in, each, type, and, there, were, infinitely, many, types, they, also, had, to, make, several, compromises, in, order, to, develop, much, of, mathematics, such, as, the, axiom, of, reducibility, even, russell, said, that, this, axiom, did, not, really, belong, to, logic, modern, logicists, like, bob, hale, crispin, wright, and, perhaps, others, have, returned, to, a, program, closer, to, frege, s, they, have, abandoned, basic, law, v, in, favor, of, abstraction, principles, such, as, hume, s, principle, the, number, of, objects, falling, under, the, concept, f, equals, the, number, of, objects, falling, under, the, concept, g, if, and, only, if, the, extension, of, f, and, the, extension, of, g, can, be, put, into, one, to, one, correspondence, frege, required, basic, law, v, to, be, able, to, give, an, explicit, definition, of, the, numbers, but, all, the, properties, of, numbers, can, be, derived, from, hume, s, principle, this, would, not, have, been, enough, for, frege, because, to, paraphrase, him, it, does, not, exclude, the, possibility, that, the, number, 3, is, in, fact, julius, caesar, in, addition, many, of, the, weakened, principles, that, they, have, had, to, adopt, to, replace, basic, law, v, no, longer, seem, so, obviously, analytic, and, thus, purely, logical, formalism, holds, that, mathematical, statements, may, be, thought, of, as, statements, about, the, consequences, of, certain, string, manipulation, rules, for, example, in, the, game, of, euclidean, geometry, which, is, seen, as, consisting, of, some, strings, called, axioms, and, some, rules, of, inference, to, generate, new, strings, from, given, ones, one, can, prove, that, the, pythagorean, theorem, holds, that, is, one, can, generate, the, string, corresponding, to, the, pythagorean, theorem, according, to, formalism, mathematical, truths, are, not, about, numbers, and, sets, and, triangles, and, the, like, in, fact, they, are, not, about, anything, at, all, another, version, of, formalism, is, known, as, deductivism, in, deductivism, the, pythagorean, theorem, is, not, an, absolute, truth, but, a, relative, one, if, it, follows, deductively, from, the, appropriate, axioms, the, same, is, held, to, be, true, for, all, other, mathematical, statements, formalism, need, not, mean, that, mathematics, is, nothing, more, than, a, meaningless, symbolic, game, it, is, usually, hoped, that, there, exists, some, interpretation, in, which, the, rules, of, the, game, hold, compare, this, position, to, structuralism, but, it, does, allow, the, working, mathematician, to, continue, in, his, or, her, work, and, leave, such, problems, to, the, philosopher, or, scientist, many, formalists, would, say, that, in, practice, the, axiom, systems, to, be, studied, will, be, suggested, by, the, demands, of, science, or, other, areas, of, mathematics, a, major, early, proponent, of, formalism, was, david, hilbert, whose, program, was, intended, to, be, a, complete, and, consistent, axiomatization, of, all, of, mathematics, hilbert, aimed, to, show, the, consistency, of, mathematical, systems, from, the, assumption, that, the, finitary, arithmetic, a, subsystem, of, the, usual, arithmetic, of, the, positive, integers, chosen, to, be, philosophically, uncontroversial, was, consistent, hilbert, s, goals, of, creating, a, system, of, mathematics, that, is, both, complete, and, consistent, were, seriously, undermined, by, the, second, of, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorems, which, states, that, sufficiently, expressive, consistent, axiom, systems, can, never, prove, their, own, consistency, since, any, such, axiom, system, would, contain, the, finitary, arithmetic, as, a, subsystem, g, del, s, theorem, implied, that, it, would, be, impossible, to, prove, the, system, s, consistency, relative, to, that, since, it, would, then, prove, its, own, consistency, which, g, del, had, shown, was, impossible, thus, in, order, to, show, that, any, axiomatic, system, of, mathematics, is, in, fact, consistent, one, needs, to, first, assume, the, consistency, of, a, system, of, mathematics, that, is, in, a, sense, stronger, than, the, system, to, be, proven, consistent, hilbert, was, initially, a, deductivist, but, as, may, be, clear, from, above, he, considered, certain, metamathematical, methods, to, yield, intrinsically, meaningful, results, and, was, a, realist, with, respect, to, the, finitary, arithmetic, later, he, held, the, opinion, that, there, was, no, other, meaningful, mathematics, whatsoever, regardless, of, interpretation, other, formalists, such, as, rudolf, carnap, alfred, tarski, and, haskell, curry, considered, mathematics, to, be, the, investigation, of, formal, axiom, systems, mathematical, logicians, study, formal, systems, but, are, just, as, often, realists, as, they, are, formalists, formalists, are, relatively, tolerant, and, inviting, to, new, approaches, to, logic, non, standard, number, systems, new, set, theories, etc, the, more, games, we, study, the, better, however, in, all, three, of, these, examples, motivation, is, drawn, from, existing, mathematical, or, philosophical, concerns, the, games, are, usually, not, arbitrary, the, main, critique, of, formalism, is, that, the, actual, mathematical, ideas, that, occupy, mathematicians, are, far, removed, from, the, string, manipulation, games, mentioned, above, formalism, is, thus, silent, on, the, question, of, which, axiom, systems, ought, to, be, studied, as, none, is, more, meaningful, than, another, from, a, formalistic, point, of, view, recently, some, formalist, mathematicians, have, proposed, that, all, of, our, formal, mathematical, knowledge, should, be, systematically, encoded, in, computer, readable, formats, so, as, to, facilitate, automated, proof, checking, of, mathematical, proofs, and, the, use, of, interactive, theorem, proving, in, the, development, of, mathematical, theories, and, computer, software, because, of, their, close, connection, with, computer, science, this, idea, is, also, advocated, by, mathematical, intuitionists, and, constructivists, in, the, computability, tradition, see, qed, project, for, a, general, overview, the, french, mathematician, henri, poincar, was, among, the, first, to, articulate, a, conventionalist, view, poincar, s, use, of, non, euclidean, geometries, in, his, work, on, differential, equations, convinced, him, that, euclidean, geometry, should, not, be, regarded, as, a, priori, truth, he, held, that, axioms, in, geometry, should, be, chosen, for, the, results, they, produce, not, for, their, apparent, coherence, with, human, intuitions, about, the, physical, world, in, mathematics, intuitionism, is, a, program, of, methodological, reform, whose, motto, is, that, there, are, no, non, experienced, mathematical, truths, l, e, j, brouwer, from, this, springboard, intuitionists, seek, to, reconstruct, what, they, consider, to, be, the, corrigible, portion, of, mathematics, in, accordance, with, kantian, concepts, of, being, becoming, intuition, and, knowledge, brouwer, the, founder, of, the, movement, held, that, mathematical, objects, arise, from, the, a, priori, forms, of, the, volitions, that, inform, the, perception, of, empirical, objects, a, major, force, behind, intuitionism, was, l, e, j, brouwer, who, rejected, the, usefulness, of, formalized, logic, of, any, sort, for, mathematics, his, student, arend, heyting, postulated, an, intuitionistic, logic, different, from, the, classical, aristotelian, logic, this, logic, does, not, contain, the, law, of, the, excluded, middle, and, therefore, frowns, upon, proofs, by, contradiction, the, axiom, of, choice, is, also, rejected, in, most, intuitionistic, set, theories, though, in, some, versions, it, is, accepted, in, intuitionism, the, term, explicit, construction, is, not, cleanly, defined, and, that, has, led, to, criticisms, attempts, have, been, made, to, use, the, concepts, of, turing, machine, or, computable, function, to, fill, this, gap, leading, to, the, claim, that, only, questions, regarding, the, behavior, of, finite, algorithms, are, meaningful, and, should, be, investigated, in, mathematics, this, has, led, to, the, study, of, the, computable, numbers, first, introduced, by, alan, turing, not, surprisingly, then, this, approach, to, mathematics, is, sometimes, associated, with, theoretical, computer, science, like, intuitionism, constructivism, involves, the, regulative, principle, that, only, mathematical, entities, which, can, be, explicitly, constructed, in, a, certain, sense, should, be, admitted, to, mathematical, discourse, in, this, view, mathematics, is, an, exercise, of, the, human, intuition, not, a, game, played, with, meaningless, symbols, instead, it, is, about, entities, that, we, can, create, directly, through, mental, activity, in, addition, some, adherents, of, these, schools, reject, non, constructive, proofs, such, as, using, proof, by, contradiction, when, showing, the, existence, of, an, object, or, when, trying, to, establish, the, truth, of, some, proposition, important, work, was, done, by, errett, bishop, who, managed, to, prove, versions, of, the, most, important, theorems, in, real, analysis, as, constructive, analysis, in, his, 1967, foundations, of, constructive, analysis, finitism, is, an, extreme, form, of, constructivism, according, to, which, a, mathematical, object, does, not, exist, unless, it, can, be, constructed, from, natural, numbers, in, a, finite, number, of, steps, in, her, book, philosophy, of, set, theory, mary, tiles, characterized, those, who, allow, countably, infinite, objects, as, classical, finitists, and, those, who, deny, even, countably, infinite, objects, as, strict, finitists, the, most, famous, proponent, of, finitism, was, leopold, kronecker, who, said, god, created, the, natural, numbers, all, else, is, the, work, of, man, ultrafinitism, is, an, even, more, extreme, version, of, finitism, which, rejects, not, only, infinities, but, finite, quantities, that, cannot, feasibly, be, constructed, with, available, resources, another, variant, of, finitism, is, euclidean, arithmetic, a, system, developed, by, john, penn, mayberry, in, his, book, the, foundations, of, mathematics, in, the, theory, of, sets, mayberry, s, system, is, aristotelian, in, general, inspiration, and, despite, his, strong, rejection, of, any, role, for, operationalism, or, feasibility, in, the, foundations, of, mathematics, comes, to, somewhat, similar, conclusions, such, as, for, instance, that, super, exponentiation, is, not, a, legitimate, finitary, function, structuralism, is, a, position, holding, that, mathematical, theories, describe, structures, and, that, mathematical, objects, are, exhaustively, defined, by, their, places, in, such, structures, consequently, having, no, intrinsic, properties, for, instance, it, would, maintain, that, all, that, needs, to, be, known, about, the, number, 1, is, that, it, is, the, first, whole, number, after, 0, likewise, all, the, other, whole, numbers, are, defined, by, their, places, in, a, structure, the, number, line, other, examples, of, mathematical, objects, might, include, lines, and, planes, in, geometry, or, elements, and, operations, in, abstract, algebra, structuralism, is, an, epistemologically, realistic, view, in, that, it, holds, that, mathematical, statements, have, an, objective, truth, value, however, its, central, claim, only, relates, to, what, kind, of, entity, a, mathematical, object, is, not, to, what, kind, of, existence, mathematical, objects, or, structures, have, not, in, other, words, to, their, ontology, the, kind, of, existence, mathematical, objects, have, would, clearly, be, dependent, on, that, of, the, structures, in, which, they, are, embedded, different, sub, varieties, of, structuralism, make, different, ontological, claims, in, this, regard, the, ante, rem, structuralism, before, the, thing, has, a, similar, ontology, to, platonism, structures, are, held, to, have, a, real, but, abstract, and, immaterial, existence, as, such, it, faces, the, standard, epistemological, problem, of, explaining, the, interaction, between, such, abstract, structures, and, flesh, and, blood, mathematicians, see, benacerraf, s, identification, problem, the, in, re, structuralism, in, the, thing, is, the, equivalent, of, aristotelian, realism, structures, are, held, to, exist, inasmuch, as, some, concrete, system, exemplifies, them, this, incurs, the, usual, issues, that, some, perfectly, legitimate, structures, might, accidentally, happen, not, to, exist, and, that, a, finite, physical, world, might, not, be, big, enough, to, accommodate, some, otherwise, legitimate, structures, the, post, rem, structuralism, after, the, thing, is, anti, realist, about, structures, in, a, way, that, parallels, nominalism, like, nominalism, the, post, rem, approach, denies, the, existence, of, abstract, mathematical, objects, with, properties, other, than, their, place, in, a, relational, structure, according, to, this, view, mathematical, systems, exist, and, have, structural, features, in, common, if, something, is, true, of, a, structure, it, will, be, true, of, all, systems, exemplifying, the, structure, however, it, is, merely, instrumental, to, talk, of, structures, being, held, in, common, between, systems, they, in, fact, have, no, independent, existence, embodied, mind, theories, hold, that, mathematical, thought, is, a, natural, outgrowth, of, the, human, cognitive, apparatus, which, finds, itself, in, our, physical, universe, for, example, the, abstract, concept, of, number, springs, from, the, experience, of, counting, discrete, objects, requiring, the, human, senses, such, as, sight, for, detecting, the, objects, touch, and, signalling, from, the, brain, it, is, held, that, mathematics, is, not, universal, and, does, not, exist, in, any, real, sense, other, than, in, human, brains, humans, construct, but, do, not, discover, mathematics, the, cognitive, processes, of, pattern, finding, and, distinguishing, objects, are, also, subject, to, neuroscience, if, mathematics, is, considered, to, be, relevant, to, a, natural, world, such, as, from, realism, or, a, degree, of, it, as, opposed, to, pure, solipsism, its, actual, relevance, to, reality, while, accepted, to, be, a, trustworthy, approximation, it, is, also, suggested, the, evolution, of, perceptions, the, body, and, the, senses, may, have, been, necessary, for, survival, is, not, necessarily, accurate, to, a, full, realism, and, is, still, subject, to, flaws, such, as, illusion, assumptions, consequently, the, foundations, and, axioms, in, which, mathematics, have, been, formed, by, humans, generalisations, deception, and, hallucinations, as, such, this, may, also, raise, questions, for, the, modern, scientific, method, for, its, compatibility, with, general, mathematics, as, while, relatively, reliable, it, is, still, limited, by, what, can, be, measured, by, empiricism, which, may, not, be, as, reliable, as, previously, assumed, see, also, counterintuitive, concepts, in, such, as, quantum, nonlocality, and, action, at, a, distance, another, issue, is, that, one, numeral, system, may, not, necessarily, be, applicable, to, problem, solving, subjects, such, as, complex, numbers, or, imaginary, numbers, require, specific, changes, to, more, commonly, used, axioms, of, mathematics, otherwise, they, cannot, be, adequately, understood, alternatively, computer, programmers, may, use, hexadecimal, for, its, human, friendly, representation, of, binary, coded, values, rather, than, decimal, convenient, for, counting, because, humans, have, ten, fingers, the, axioms, or, logical, rules, behind, mathematics, also, vary, through, time, such, as, the, adaption, and, invention, of, zero, as, perceptions, from, the, human, brain, are, subject, to, illusions, assumptions, deceptions, induced, hallucinations, cognitive, errors, or, assumptions, in, a, general, context, it, can, be, questioned, whether, they, are, accurate, or, strictly, indicative, of, truth, see, also, philosophy, of, being, and, the, nature, of, empiricism, itself, in, relation, to, the, universe, and, whether, it, is, independent, to, the, senses, and, the, universe, the, human, mind, has, no, special, claim, on, reality, or, approaches, to, it, built, out, of, math, if, such, constructs, as, euler, s, identity, are, true, then, they, are, true, as, a, map, of, the, human, mind, and, cognition, embodied, mind, theorists, thus, explain, the, effectiveness, of, mathematics, mathematics, was, constructed, by, the, brain, in, order, to, be, effective, in, this, universe, the, most, accessible, famous, and, infamous, treatment, of, this, perspective, is, where, mathematics, comes, from, by, george, lakoff, and, rafael, e, n, ez, in, addition, mathematician, keith, devlin, has, investigated, similar, concepts, with, his, book, the, math, instinct, as, has, neuroscientist, stanislas, dehaene, with, his, book, the, number, sense, for, more, on, the, philosophical, ideas, that, inspired, this, perspective, see, cognitive, science, of, mathematics, aristotelian, realism, holds, that, mathematics, studies, properties, such, as, symmetry, continuity, and, order, that, can, be, literally, realized, in, the, physical, world, or, in, any, other, world, there, might, be, it, contrasts, with, platonism, in, holding, that, the, objects, of, mathematics, such, as, numbers, do, not, exist, in, an, abstract, world, but, can, be, physically, realized, for, example, the, number, 4, is, realized, in, the, relation, between, a, heap, of, parrots, and, the, universal, being, a, parrot, that, divides, the, heap, into, so, many, parrots, aristotelian, realism, is, defended, by, james, franklin, and, the, sydney, school, in, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, and, is, close, to, the, view, of, penelope, maddy, that, when, an, egg, carton, is, opened, a, set, of, three, eggs, is, perceived, that, is, a, mathematical, entity, realized, in, the, physical, world, a, problem, for, aristotelian, realism, is, what, account, to, give, of, higher, infinities, which, may, not, be, realizable, in, the, physical, world, the, euclidean, arithmetic, developed, by, john, penn, mayberry, in, his, book, the, foundations, of, mathematics, in, the, theory, of, sets, also, falls, into, the, aristotelian, realist, tradition, mayberry, following, euclid, considers, numbers, to, be, simply, definite, multitudes, of, units, realized, in, nature, such, as, the, members, of, the, london, symphony, orchestra, or, the, trees, in, birnam, wood, whether, or, not, there, are, definite, multitudes, of, units, for, which, euclid, s, common, notion, 5, the, whole, is, greater, than, the, part, fails, and, which, would, consequently, be, reckoned, as, infinite, is, for, mayberry, essentially, a, question, about, nature, and, does, not, entail, any, transcendental, suppositions, psychologism, in, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, is, the, position, that, mathematical, concepts, and, or, truths, are, grounded, in, derived, from, or, explained, by, psychological, facts, or, laws, john, stuart, mill, seems, to, have, been, an, advocate, of, a, type, of, logical, psychologism, as, were, many, 19th, century, german, logicians, such, as, sigwart, and, erdmann, as, well, as, a, number, of, psychologists, past, and, present, for, example, gustave, le, bon, psychologism, was, famously, criticized, by, frege, in, his, the, foundations, of, arithmetic, and, many, of, his, works, and, essays, including, his, review, of, husserl, s, philosophy, of, arithmetic, edmund, husserl, in, the, first, volume, of, his, logical, investigations, called, the, prolegomena, of, pure, logic, criticized, psychologism, thoroughly, and, sought, to, distance, himself, from, it, the, prolegomena, is, considered, a, more, concise, fair, and, thorough, refutation, of, psychologism, than, the, criticisms, made, by, frege, and, also, it, is, considered, today, by, many, as, being, a, memorable, refutation, for, its, decisive, blow, to, psychologism, psychologism, was, also, criticized, by, charles, sanders, peirce, and, maurice, merleau, ponty, mathematical, empiricism, is, a, form, of, realism, that, denies, that, mathematics, can, be, known, a, priori, at, all, it, says, that, we, discover, mathematical, facts, by, empirical, research, just, like, facts, in, any, of, the, other, sciences, it, is, not, one, of, the, classical, three, positions, advocated, in, the, early, 20th, century, but, primarily, arose, in, the, middle, of, the, century, however, an, important, early, proponent, of, a, view, like, this, was, john, stuart, mill, mill, s, view, was, widely, criticized, because, according, to, critics, such, as, a, j, ayer, it, makes, statements, like, 2, 2, 4, come, out, as, uncertain, contingent, truths, which, we, can, only, learn, by, observing, instances, of, two, pairs, coming, together, and, forming, a, quartet, karl, popper, was, another, philosopher, to, point, out, empirical, aspects, of, mathematics, observing, that, most, mathematical, theories, are, like, those, of, physics, and, biology, hypothetico, deductive, pure, mathematics, therefore, turns, out, to, be, much, closer, to, the, natural, sciences, whose, hypotheses, are, conjectures, than, it, seemed, even, recently, popper, also, noted, he, would, admit, a, system, as, empirical, or, scientific, only, if, it, is, capable, of, being, tested, by, experience, contemporary, mathematical, empiricism, formulated, by, w, v, o, quine, and, hilary, putnam, is, primarily, supported, by, the, indispensability, argument, mathematics, is, indispensable, to, all, empirical, sciences, and, if, we, want, to, believe, in, the, reality, of, the, phenomena, described, by, the, sciences, we, ought, also, believe, in, the, reality, of, those, entities, required, for, this, description, that, is, since, physics, needs, to, talk, about, electrons, to, say, why, light, bulbs, behave, as, they, do, then, electrons, must, exist, since, physics, needs, to, talk, about, numbers, in, offering, any, of, its, explanations, then, numbers, must, exist, in, keeping, with, quine, and, putnam, s, overall, philosophies, this, is, a, naturalistic, argument, it, argues, for, the, existence, of, mathematical, entities, as, the, best, explanation, for, experience, thus, stripping, mathematics, of, being, distinct, from, the, other, sciences, putnam, strongly, rejected, the, term, platonist, as, implying, an, over, specific, ontology, that, was, not, necessary, to, mathematical, practice, in, any, real, sense, he, advocated, a, form, of, pure, realism, that, rejected, mystical, notions, of, truth, and, accepted, much, quasi, empiricism, in, mathematics, this, grew, from, the, increasingly, popular, assertion, in, the, late, 20th, century, that, no, one, foundation, of, mathematics, could, be, ever, proven, to, exist, it, is, also, sometimes, called, postmodernism, in, mathematics, although, that, term, is, considered, overloaded, by, some, and, insulting, by, others, quasi, empiricism, argues, that, in, doing, their, research, mathematicians, test, hypotheses, as, well, as, prove, theorems, a, mathematical, argument, can, transmit, falsity, from, the, conclusion, to, the, premises, just, as, well, as, it, can, transmit, truth, from, the, premises, to, the, conclusion, putnam, has, argued, that, any, theory, of, mathematical, realism, would, include, quasi, empirical, methods, he, proposed, that, an, alien, species, doing, mathematics, might, well, rely, on, quasi, empirical, methods, primarily, being, willing, often, to, forgo, rigorous, and, axiomatic, proofs, and, still, be, doing, mathematics, at, perhaps, a, somewhat, greater, risk, of, failure, of, their, calculations, he, gave, a, detailed, argument, for, this, in, new, directions, quasi, empiricism, was, also, developed, by, imre, lakatos, the, most, important, criticism, of, empirical, views, of, mathematics, is, approximately, the, same, as, that, raised, against, mill, if, mathematics, is, just, as, empirical, as, the, other, sciences, then, this, suggests, that, its, results, are, just, as, fallible, as, theirs, and, just, as, contingent, in, mill, s, case, the, empirical, justification, comes, directly, while, in, quine, s, case, it, comes, indirectly, through, the, coherence, of, our, scientific, theory, as, a, whole, i, e, consilience, after, e, o, wilson, quine, suggests, that, mathematics, seems, completely, certain, because, the, role, it, plays, in, our, web, of, belief, is, extraordinarily, central, and, that, it, would, be, extremely, difficult, for, us, to, revise, it, though, not, impossible, for, a, philosophy, of, mathematics, that, attempts, to, overcome, some, of, the, shortcomings, of, quine, and, g, del, s, approaches, by, taking, aspects, of, each, see, penelope, maddy, s, realism, in, mathematics, another, example, of, a, realist, theory, is, the, embodied, mind, theory, for, experimental, evidence, suggesting, that, human, infants, can, do, elementary, arithmetic, see, brian, butterworth, mathematical, fictionalism, was, brought, to, fame, in, 1980, when, hartry, field, published, science, without, numbers, which, rejected, and, in, fact, reversed, quine, s, indispensability, argument, where, quine, suggested, that, mathematics, was, indispensable, for, our, best, scientific, theories, and, therefore, should, be, accepted, as, a, body, of, truths, talking, about, independently, existing, entities, field, suggested, that, mathematics, was, dispensable, and, therefore, should, be, considered, as, a, body, of, falsehoods, not, talking, about, anything, real, he, did, this, by, giving, a, complete, axiomatization, of, newtonian, mechanics, with, no, reference, to, numbers, or, functions, at, all, he, started, with, the, betweenness, of, hilbert, s, axioms, to, characterize, space, without, coordinatizing, it, and, then, added, extra, relations, between, points, to, do, the, work, formerly, done, by, vector, fields, hilbert, s, geometry, is, mathematical, because, it, talks, about, abstract, points, but, in, field, s, theory, these, points, are, the, concrete, points, of, physical, space, so, no, special, mathematical, objects, at, all, are, needed, having, shown, how, to, do, science, without, using, numbers, field, proceeded, to, rehabilitate, mathematics, as, a, kind, of, useful, fiction, he, showed, that, mathematical, physics, is, a, conservative, extension, of, his, non, mathematical, physics, that, is, every, physical, fact, provable, in, mathematical, physics, is, already, provable, from, field, s, system, so, that, mathematics, is, a, reliable, process, whose, physical, applications, are, all, true, even, though, its, own, statements, are, false, thus, when, doing, mathematics, we, can, see, ourselves, as, telling, a, sort, of, story, talking, as, if, numbers, existed, for, field, a, statement, like, 2, 2, 4, is, just, as, fictitious, as, sherlock, holmes, lived, at, 221b, baker, street, but, both, are, true, according, to, the, relevant, fictions, another, fictionalist, mary, leng, expresses, the, perspective, succinctly, by, dismissing, any, seeming, connection, between, mathematics, and, the, physical, world, as, a, happy, coincidence, this, rejection, separates, fictionalism, from, other, forms, of, anti, realism, which, see, mathematics, itself, as, artificial, but, still, bounded, or, fitted, to, reality, in, some, way, by, this, account, there, are, no, metaphysical, or, epistemological, problems, special, to, mathematics, the, only, worries, left, are, the, general, worries, about, non, mathematical, physics, and, about, fiction, in, general, field, s, approach, has, been, very, influential, but, is, widely, rejected, this, is, in, part, because, of, the, requirement, of, strong, fragments, of, second, order, logic, to, carry, out, his, reduction, and, because, the, statement, of, conservativity, seems, to, require, quantification, over, abstract, models, or, deductions, social, constructivism, sees, mathematics, primarily, as, a, social, construct, as, a, product, of, culture, subject, to, correction, and, change, like, the, other, sciences, mathematics, is, viewed, as, an, empirical, endeavor, whose, results, are, constantly, evaluated, and, may, be, discarded, however, while, on, an, empiricist, view, the, evaluation, is, some, sort, of, comparison, with, reality, social, constructivists, emphasize, that, the, direction, of, mathematical, research, is, dictated, by, the, fashions, of, the, social, group, performing, it, or, by, the, needs, of, the, society, financing, it, however, although, such, external, forces, may, change, the, direction, of, some, mathematical, research, there, are, strong, internal, constraints, the, mathematical, traditions, methods, problems, meanings, and, values, into, which, mathematicians, are, enculturated, that, work, to, conserve, the, historically, defined, discipline, this, runs, counter, to, the, traditional, beliefs, of, working, mathematicians, that, mathematics, is, somehow, pure, or, objective, but, social, constructivists, argue, that, mathematics, is, in, fact, grounded, by, much, uncertainty, as, mathematical, practice, evolves, the, status, of, previous, mathematics, is, cast, into, doubt, and, is, corrected, to, the, degree, it, is, required, or, desired, by, the, current, mathematical, community, this, can, be, seen, in, the, development, of, analysis, from, reexamination, of, the, calculus, of, leibniz, and, newton, they, argue, further, that, finished, mathematics, is, often, accorded, too, much, status, and, folk, mathematics, not, enough, due, to, an, overemphasis, on, axiomatic, proof, and, peer, review, as, practices, the, social, nature, of, mathematics, is, highlighted, in, its, subcultures, major, discoveries, can, be, made, in, one, branch, of, mathematics, and, be, relevant, to, another, yet, the, relationship, goes, undiscovered, for, lack, of, social, contact, between, mathematicians, social, constructivists, argue, each, speciality, forms, its, own, epistemic, community, and, often, has, great, difficulty, communicating, or, motivating, the, investigation, of, unifying, conjectures, that, might, relate, different, areas, of, mathematics, social, constructivists, see, the, process, of, doing, mathematics, as, actually, creating, the, meaning, while, social, realists, see, a, deficiency, either, of, human, capacity, to, abstractify, or, of, human, s, cognitive, bias, or, of, mathematicians, collective, intelligence, as, preventing, the, comprehension, of, a, real, universe, of, mathematical, objects, social, constructivists, sometimes, reject, the, search, for, foundations, of, mathematics, as, bound, to, fail, as, pointless, or, even, meaningless, contributions, to, this, school, have, been, made, by, imre, lakatos, and, thomas, tymoczko, although, it, is, not, clear, that, either, would, endorse, the, title, more, recently, paul, ernest, has, explicitly, formulated, a, social, constructivist, philosophy, of, mathematics, some, consider, the, work, of, paul, erd, s, as, a, whole, to, have, advanced, this, view, although, he, personally, rejected, it, because, of, his, uniquely, broad, collaborations, which, prompted, others, to, see, and, study, mathematics, as, a, social, activity, e, g, via, the, erd, s, number, reuben, hersh, has, also, promoted, the, social, view, of, mathematics, calling, it, a, humanistic, approach, similar, to, but, not, quite, the, same, as, that, associated, with, alvin, white, one, of, hersh, s, co, authors, philip, j, davis, has, expressed, sympathy, for, the, social, view, as, well, rather, than, focus, on, narrow, debates, about, the, true, nature, of, mathematical, truth, or, even, on, practices, unique, to, mathematicians, such, as, the, proof, a, growing, movement, from, the, 1960s, to, the, 1990s, began, to, question, the, idea, of, seeking, foundations, or, finding, any, one, right, answer, to, why, mathematics, works, the, starting, point, for, this, was, eugene, wigner, s, famous, 1960, paper, the, unreasonable, effectiveness, of, mathematics, in, the, natural, sciences, in, which, he, argued, that, the, happy, coincidence, of, mathematics, and, physics, being, so, well, matched, seemed, to, be, unreasonable, and, hard, to, explain, realist, and, constructivist, theories, are, normally, taken, to, be, contraries, however, karl, popper, argued, that, a, number, statement, such, as, 2, apples, 2, apples, 4, apples, can, be, taken, in, two, senses, in, one, sense, it, is, irrefutable, and, logically, true, in, the, second, sense, it, is, factually, true, and, falsifiable, another, way, of, putting, this, is, to, say, that, a, single, number, statement, can, express, two, propositions, one, of, which, can, be, explained, on, constructivist, lines, the, other, on, realist, lines, innovations, in, the, philosophy, of, language, during, the, 20th, century, renewed, interest, in, whether, mathematics, is, as, is, often, said, the, language, of, science, although, some, mathematicians, and, philosophers, would, accept, the, statement, mathematics, is, a, language, most, consider, that, the, language, of, mathematics, is, a, part, of, mathematics, to, which, mathematics, cannot, be, reduced, linguists, believe, that, the, implications, of, such, a, statement, must, be, considered, for, example, the, tools, of, linguistics, are, not, generally, applied, to, the, symbol, systems, of, mathematics, that, is, mathematics, is, studied, in, a, markedly, different, way, from, other, languages, if, mathematics, is, a, language, it, is, a, different, type, of, language, from, natural, languages, indeed, because, of, the, need, for, clarity, and, specificity, the, language, of, mathematics, is, far, more, constrained, than, natural, languages, studied, by, linguists, however, the, methods, developed, by, frege, and, tarski, for, the, study, of, mathematical, language, have, been, extended, greatly, by, tarski, s, student, richard, montague, and, other, linguists, working, in, formal, semantics, to, show, that, the, distinction, between, mathematical, language, and, natural, language, may, not, be, as, great, as, it, seems, mohan, ganesalingam, has, analysed, mathematical, language, using, tools, from, formal, linguistics, ganesalingam, notes, that, some, features, of, natural, language, are, not, necessary, when, analysing, mathematical, language, such, as, tense, but, many, of, the, same, analytical, tools, can, be, used, such, as, context, free, grammars, one, important, difference, is, that, mathematical, objects, have, clearly, defined, types, which, can, be, explicitly, defined, in, a, text, effectively, we, are, allowed, to, introduce, a, word, in, one, part, of, a, sentence, and, declare, its, part, of, speech, in, another, and, this, operation, has, no, analogue, in, natural, language, 251, this, argument, associated, with, willard, quine, and, hilary, putnam, is, considered, by, stephen, yablo, to, be, one, of, the, most, challenging, arguments, in, favor, of, the, acceptance, of, the, existence, of, abstract, mathematical, entities, such, as, numbers, and, sets, the, form, of, the, argument, is, as, follows, the, justification, for, the, first, premise, is, the, most, controversial, both, putnam, and, quine, invoke, naturalism, to, justify, the, exclusion, of, all, non, scientific, entities, and, hence, to, defend, the, only, part, of, all, and, only, the, assertion, that, all, entities, postulated, in, scientific, theories, including, numbers, should, be, accepted, as, real, is, justified, by, confirmation, holism, since, theories, are, not, confirmed, in, a, piecemeal, fashion, but, as, a, whole, there, is, no, justification, for, excluding, any, of, the, entities, referred, to, in, well, confirmed, theories, this, puts, the, nominalist, who, wishes, to, exclude, the, existence, of, sets, and, non, euclidean, geometry, but, to, include, the, existence, of, quarks, and, other, undetectable, entities, of, physics, for, example, in, a, difficult, position, the, anti, realist, epistemic, argument, against, platonism, has, been, made, by, paul, benacerraf, and, hartry, field, platonism, posits, that, mathematical, objects, are, abstract, entities, by, general, agreement, abstract, entities, cannot, interact, causally, with, concrete, physical, entities, the, truth, values, of, our, mathematical, assertions, depend, on, facts, involving, platonic, entities, that, reside, in, a, realm, outside, of, space, time, whilst, our, knowledge, of, concrete, physical, objects, is, based, on, our, ability, to, perceive, them, and, therefore, to, causally, interact, with, them, there, is, no, parallel, account, of, how, mathematicians, come, to, have, knowledge, of, abstract, objects, another, way, of, making, the, point, is, that, if, the, platonic, world, were, to, disappear, it, would, make, no, difference, to, the, ability, of, mathematicians, to, generate, proofs, etc, which, is, already, fully, accountable, in, terms, of, physical, processes, in, their, brains, field, developed, his, views, into, fictionalism, benacerraf, also, developed, the, philosophy, of, mathematical, structuralism, according, to, which, there, are, no, mathematical, objects, nonetheless, some, versions, of, structuralism, are, compatible, with, some, versions, of, realism, the, argument, hinges, on, the, idea, that, a, satisfactory, naturalistic, account, of, thought, processes, in, terms, of, brain, processes, can, be, given, for, mathematical, reasoning, along, with, everything, else, one, line, of, defense, is, to, maintain, that, this, is, false, so, that, mathematical, reasoning, uses, some, special, intuition, that, involves, contact, with, the, platonic, realm, a, modern, form, of, this, argument, is, given, by, sir, roger, penrose, another, line, of, defense, is, to, maintain, that, abstract, objects, are, relevant, to, mathematical, reasoning, in, a, way, that, is, non, causal, and, not, analogous, to, perception, this, argument, is, developed, by, jerrold, katz, in, his, 2000, book, realistic, rationalism, a, more, radical, defense, is, denial, of, physical, reality, i, e, the, mathematical, universe, hypothesis, in, that, case, a, mathematician, s, knowledge, of, mathematics, is, one, mathematical, object, making, contact, with, another, many, practicing, mathematicians, have, been, drawn, to, their, subject, because, of, a, sense, of, beauty, they, perceive, in, it, one, sometimes, hears, the, sentiment, that, mathematicians, would, like, to, leave, philosophy, to, the, philosophers, and, get, back, to, mathematics, where, presumably, the, beauty, lies, in, his, work, on, the, divine, proportion, h, e, huntley, relates, the, feeling, of, reading, and, understanding, someone, else, s, proof, of, a, theorem, of, mathematics, to, that, of, a, viewer, of, a, masterpiece, of, art, the, reader, of, a, proof, has, a, similar, sense, of, exhilaration, at, understanding, as, the, original, author, of, the, proof, much, as, he, argues, the, viewer, of, a, masterpiece, has, a, sense, of, exhilaration, similar, to, the, original, painter, or, sculptor, indeed, one, can, study, mathematical, and, scientific, writings, as, literature, philip, j, davis, and, reuben, hersh, have, commented, that, the, sense, of, mathematical, beauty, is, universal, amongst, practicing, mathematicians, by, way, of, example, they, provide, two, proofs, of, the, irrationality, of, 2, the, first, is, the, traditional, proof, by, contradiction, ascribed, to, euclid, the, second, is, a, more, direct, proof, involving, the, fundamental, theorem, of, arithmetic, that, they, argue, gets, to, the, heart, of, the, issue, davis, and, hersh, argue, that, mathematicians, find, the, second, proof, more, aesthetically, appealing, because, it, gets, closer, to, the, nature, of, the, problem, paul, erd, s, was, well, known, for, his, notion, of, a, hypothetical, book, containing, the, most, elegant, or, beautiful, mathematical, proofs, there, is, not, universal, agreement, that, a, result, has, one, most, elegant, proof, gregory, chaitin, has, argued, against, this, idea, philosophers, have, sometimes, criticized, mathematicians, sense, of, beauty, or, elegance, as, being, at, best, vaguely, stated, by, the, same, token, however, philosophers, of, mathematics, have, sought, to, characterize, what, makes, one, proof, more, desirable, than, another, when, both, are, logically, sound, another, aspect, of, aesthetics, concerning, mathematics, is, mathematicians, views, towards, the, possible, uses, of, mathematics, for, purposes, deemed, unethical, or, inappropriate, the, best, known, exposition, of, this, view, occurs, in, g, h, hardy, s, book, a, mathematician, s, apology, in, which, hardy, argues, that, pure, mathematics, is, superior, in, beauty, to, applied, mathematics, precisely, because, it, cannot, be, used, for, war, and, similar, ends
