these, as, spurious, and, became, concerned, about, establishing, an, authentic, anthology, of, approved, hymns, guru, arjan, began, compiling, an, officially, approved, version, of, the, sacred, scripture, for, the, sikh, community, he, sent, his, associates, across, the, indian, subcontinent, to, collect, the, circulating, hymns, of, sikh, gurus, and, convinced, mohan, the, son, of, guru, amar, das, to, give, him, the, collection, of, the, religious, writings, of, the, first, three, gurus, in, a, humble, manner, by, singing, the, hymns, registered, in, guru, granth, sahib, 248, o, mohan, your, temple, is, so, lofty, and, your, mansion, is, unsurpassed, o, mohan, your, gates, are, so, beautiful, they, are, the, worship, houses, of, the, saints, as, his, associates, returned, with, their, collections, guru, arjan, selected, and, edited, the, hymns, for, inclusion, in, the, adi, granth, with, bhai, gurdas, as, his, scribe, this, effort, yielded, several, drafts, and, manuscripts, some, of, which, have, survived, into, the, modern, era, the, oldest, surviving, manuscript, version, of, the, adi, granth, is, the, guru, nanak, dev, university, manuscript, 1245, which, has, been, dated, to, c, 1599, other, early, editions, of, the, adi, granth, with, some, variations, include, the, bahoval, pothi, c, 1600, vanjara, pothi, c, 1601, and, bhai, rupa, pothi, c, 1603, another, early, variant, manuscript, is, called, the, guru, harsahai, pothi, preserved, by, sodhis, and, is, believed, to, be, the, one, that, existed, before, guru, arjan, s, compilation, and, one, he, gave, to, his, eldest, brother, prithi, chand, it, was, initially, installed, in, amritsar, then, was, moved, in, the, 18th, century, and, preserved, in, guru, harsahai, 35, kilometers, west, of, faridkot, punjab, till, 1969, when, the, state, government, requested, it, be, displayed, for, the, 500, years, celebrations, it, was, moved, for, the, first, time, in, over, 200, years, and, briefly,

was, stolen, however, photos, of, some, pages, have, survived, this, manuscript, is, claimed, by, the, sodhis, to, be, the, oldest, and, one, written, in, part, by, guru, nanak, however, this, claim, is, first, observed, only, much, later, in, texts, attributed, to, the, 17th, century, hariji, the, grandson, of, prithi, chand, based, on, the, evidence, in, the, surviving, photos, it, is, unlikely, that, guru, nanak, wrote, or, maintained, a, pothi, the, features, in, its, gurmukhi, script, and, the, language, suggest, that, the, hymns, are, significantly, older, and, that, the, pre, canonical, hymns, were, being, written, down, in, early, sikhism, and, preserved, by, the, sikh, gurus, prior, to, the, editing, by, guru, arjan, the, existence, of, guru, harsahai, manuscript, attests, to, the, early, tradition, of, sikh, scripture, its, existence, in, variant, forms, and, a, competition, of, ideas, on, its, contents, including, the, mul, mantar, many, minor, variations, and, three,

version, called, the, lahori, bir, but, it, primarily, differs, in, how, the, hymns, are, arranged, and, the, final, pages, of, the, adi, granth, in, 1604, the, first, edition, of, the, sikh, scripture, adi, granth, was, complete, and, officially, approved, by, guru, arjan, it, was, installed, at, the, golden, temple, with, baba, buddha, as, the, first, granthi, or, reader, no, hymns,

adi, granth, to, create, the, final, edition, called, the, guru, granth, sahib, prior, to, guru, gobind, singh, three, versions, of, the, adi, granth, pothi, with, minor, variations, were, in, circulation, at, sikh, shrines, across, the, indian, subcontinent, in, addition, several, unauthorized, versions, were, in, circulation, issued, by, sects, founded, by, one, of, the, sons, or,

myrvold, that, is, found, in, all, major, faiths, ernest, trumpp, a, german, philologist, published, the, first, philological, study, and, a, major, but, incomplete, english, translation, of, the, guru, granth, sahib, in, 1877, after, an, eight, year, study, of, the, text, and, field, interviews, with, sikh, intelligentsia, of, his, time, trumpp, included, his, criticism, of, the, sikh, scripture, in, the, preface, and, introductory, sections, and, stated, sikhism, is, a, waning, religion, that, will, soon, belong, to, history, many, in, the, sikh, community, regarded, these, introductory, remarks, to, his, translation, as, extremely, offensive, nonetheless, according, to, indologist, mark, juergensmeyer, ernest, trumpp, s, years, of, scholarship, translations, and, field, notes, and, discussions, with, sikhs, at, the, golden, temple, remain, valuable, reference, works, for, contemporary, scholars, akshaya, kumar, holds, trumpp, s, translation, to, be, literal, and, mechanical, emphasizing, preciseness, and, fastidiously, retaining, the, words, as, well, as, the, syntax, of, the, original, verses, avoiding, any, creative, and, inventive, restatement, to, empathize, with, a, believer, on, the, other, hand, arvind, pal, singh, mandair, noted, the, clear, influence, from, the, brahmanical, leanings, of, his, nirmala, collaborators, among, the, british, supported, sikh, class, which, had, been, long, enjoying, british, patronage, as, they, helped, to, keep, hostile, elements, under, control, for, example, they, induced, trumpp, to, omit, the, numeral, one, in, the, phrase, ik, oankar, in, his, translation, in, an, attempt, to, bring, the, scripture, closer, to, the, brahmanical, influenced, interpretation, of, the, sects, that, differed, with, the, interpretation, of, the, orthodox, khalsa, trumpp, s, translation, was, seen, to, be, a, challenge, to, the, administration, s, already, established, view, that, the, sikhs, were, a, distinct, community, prompting, the, khalsa, to, commission, its, own, translation, trumpp, as, well, as, other, translators, were, commissioned, by, colonial, administrators, max, arthur, macauliffe, a, british, civil, servant, was, next, to, publish, a, major, but, incomplete, translation, of, the, guru, granth, sahib, covering, the, same, ground, as, trumpp, however, he, interspersed, his, translation, between, janamsakhis, based, mythical, history, of, the, sikh, gurus, a, major, source, of, his, historical, information, was, suraj, prakash, of, santokh, singh, and, his, primary, translation, advisor, was, the, prominent, khalsa, sikh, scholar, kahn, singh, nabha, the, author, of, gurmat, prabhakar, and, hum, hindu, nahin, macauliffe, s, translation, appeared, embedded, in, the, six, volume, the, sikh, religion, and, was, published, by, oxford, university, press, in, 1909, unlike, trumpp, who, was, unconcered, with, the, sensibilities, of, the, sikhs, macauliffe, used, his, editorial, abilities, to, incorporate, such, considerations, according, to, indologist, giorgio, shan, while, trumpp, criticized, sikhism, and, the, guru, granth, sahib, macauliffe, criticized, hinduism, and, wrote, an, introduction, that, presented, the, hymns, of, sikh, gurus, as, christian, like, with, affinities, to, protestant, virtues, and, ethics, presumably, for, a, british, audience, macauliffe, s, translation, was, well, received, by, the, sikh, community, and, they, considered, it, closer, to, how, they, interpret, their, scripture, post, colonial, scholarship, has, questioned, macauliffe, s, accounting, for, and, incorporation, of, sikh, traditions, as, uncritical, and, dubious, though, one, that, pleased, the, sikh, community, macauliffe, s, version, has, been, widely, followed, by, later, scholars, and, translators, according, to, christopher, shackle, a, scholar, of, languages, and, religion, macauliffe, s, approach, to, translation, was, to, work, with, khalsa, sikh, reformists, of, the, 1890s, singh, sabha, and, exegetically, present, the, scripture, in, a, progressive, monotheism, fold, that, deserved, the, support, of, the, british,
