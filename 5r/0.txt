language, it, is, a, rational, and, critical, inquiry, that, reflects, on, its, own, methods, and, assumptions, historically, many, of, the, individual, sciences, such, as, physics, and, psychology, formed, part, of, philosophy, however, they, are, considered, separate, academic, disciplines, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, term, influential, traditions, in, the, history, of, philosophy, include, western, arabic, persian, indian, and, chinese, philosophy, western, philosophy, originated, in, ancient, greece, and, covers, a, wide, area, of, philosophical, subfields, a, central, topic, in, arabic, persian, philosophy, is, the, relation, between, reason, and, revelation, indian, philosophy, combines, the, spiritual, problem, of, how, to, reach, enlightenment, with, the, exploration, of, the, nature, of, reality, and, the, ways, of, arriving, at, knowledge, chinese, philosophy, focuses, principally, on, practical, issues, in, relation, to, right, social, conduct, government, and, self, cultivation, major, branches, of, philosophy, are, epistemology, ethics, logic, and, metaphysics, epistemology, studies, what, knowledge, is, and, how, to, acquire, it, ethics, investigates, moral, principles, and, what, constitutes, right, conduct, logic, is, the, study, of, correct, reasoning, and, explores, how, good, arguments, can, be, distinguished, from, bad, ones, metaphysics, examines, the, most, general, features, of, reality, existence, objects, and, properties, other, subfields, are, aesthetics, philosophy, of, language, philosophy, of, mind, philosophy, of, religion, philosophy, of, science, philosophy, of, mathematics, philosophy, of, history, and, political, philosophy, within, each, branch, there, are, competing, schools, of, philosophy, that, promote, different, principles, theories, or, methods, philosophers, use, a, great, variety, of, methods, to, arrive, at, philosophical, knowledge, they, include, conceptual, analysis, reliance, on, common, sense, and, intuitions, use, of, thought, experiments, analysis, of, ordinary, language, description, of, experience, and, critical, questioning, philosophy, is, related, to, many, other, fields, including, the, sciences, mathematics, business, law, and, journalism, it, provides, an, interdisciplinary, perspective, and, studies, the, scope, and, fundamental, concepts, of, these, fields, it, also, investigates, their, methods, and, ethical, implications, the, word, philosophy, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, words, philos, love, and, sophia, wisdom, some, sources, say, that, the, term, was, coined, by, the, pre, socratic, philosopher, pythagoras, but, this, is, not, certain, the, word, entered, the, english, language, primarily, from, old, french, and, anglo, norman, starting, around, 1175, ce, the, french, philosophie, is, itself, a, borrowing, from, the, latin, philosophia, the, term, philosophy, acquired, the, meanings, of, advanced, study, of, the, speculative, subjects, logic, ethics, physics, and, metaphysics, deep, wisdom, consisting, of, love, of, truth, and, virtuous, living, profound, learning, as, transmitted, by, the, ancient, writers, and, the, study, of, the, fundamental, nature, of, knowledge, reality, and, existence, and, the, basic, limits, of, human, understanding, before, the, modern, age, the, term, philosophy, was, used, in, a, wide, sense, it, included, most, forms, of, rational, inquiry, such, as, the, individual, sciences, as, its, subdisciplines, for, instance, natural, philosophy, was, a, major, branch, of, philosophy, this, branch, of, philosophy, encompassed, a, wide, range, of, fields, including, disciplines, like, physics, chemistry, and, biology, an, example, of, this, usage, is, the, 1687, book, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, by, isaac, newton, this, book, referred, to, natural, philosophy, in, its, title, but, it, is, today, considered, a, book, of, physics, the, meaning, of, philosophy, changed, toward, the, end, of, the, modern, period, when, it, acquired, the, more, narrow, meaning, common, today, in, this, new, sense, the, term, is, mainly, associated, with, philosophical, disciplines, like, metaphysics, epistemology, and, ethics, among, other, topics, it, covers, the, rational, study, of, reality, knowledge, and, values, it, is, distinguished, from, other, disciplines, of, rational, inquiry, such, as, the, empirical, sciences, and, mathematics, the, practice, of, philosophy, is, characterized, by, several, general, features, it, is, a, form, of, rational, inquiry, it, aims, to, be, systematic, and, it, tends, to, critically, reflect, on, its, own, methods, and, presuppositions, it, requires, attentively, thinking, long, and, carefully, about, the, provocative, vexing, and, enduring, problems, central, to, the, human, condition, the, philosophical, pursuit, of, wisdom, involves, asking, general, and, fundamental, questions, it, often, does, not, result, in, straightforward, answers, but, may, help, a, person, to, better, understand, the, topic, examine, their, life, dispel, confusion, and, overcome, prejudices, and, self, deceptive, ideas, associated, with, common, sense, for, example, socrates, stated, that, the, unexamined, life, is, not, worth, living, to, highlight, the, role, of, philosophical, inquiry, in, understanding, one, s, own, existence, and, according, to, bertrand, russell, the, man, who, has, no, tincture, of, philosophy, goes, through, life, imprisoned, in, the, prejudices, derived, from, common, sense, from, the, habitual, beliefs, of, his, age, or, his, nation, and, from, convictions, which, have, grown, up, in, his, mind, without, the, cooperation, or, consent, of, his, deliberate, reason, attempts, to, provide, more, precise, definitions, of, philosophy, are, controversial, and, are, studied, in, metaphilosophy, some, approaches, argue, that, there, is, a, set, of, essential, features, shared, by, all, parts, of, philosophy, others, see, only, weaker, family, resemblances, or, contend, that, it, is, merely, an, empty, blanket, term, precise, definitions, are, often, only, accepted, by, theorists, belonging, to, a, certain, philosophical, movement, and, are, revisionistic, according, to, s, ren, overgaard, et, al, in, that, many, presumed, parts, of, philosophy, would, not, deserve, the, title, philosophy, if, they, were, true, some, definitions, characterize, philosophy, in, relation, to, its, method, like, pure, reasoning, others, focus, on, its, topic, for, example, as, the, study, of, the, biggest, patterns, of, the, world, as, a, whole, or, as, the, attempt, to, answer, the, big, questions, such, an, approach, is, pursued, by, immanuel, kant, who, holds, that, the, task, of, philosophy, is, united, by, four, questions, what, can, i, know, what, should, i, do, what, may, i, hope, and, what, is, the, human, being, both, approaches, have, the, problem, that, they, are, usually, either, too, wide, by, including, non, philosophical, disciplines, or, too, narrow, by, excluding, some, philosophical, sub, disciplines, many, definitions, of, philosophy, emphasize, its, intimate, relation, to, science, in, this, sense, philosophy, is, sometimes, understood, as, a, proper, science, in, its, own, right, according, to, some, naturalistic, philosophers, such, as, w, v, o, quine, philosophy, is, an, empirical, yet, abstract, science, that, is, concerned, with, wide, ranging, empirical, patterns, instead, of, particular, observations, science, based, definitions, usually, face, the, problem, of, explaining, why, philosophy, in, its, long, history, has, not, progressed, to, the, same, extent, or, in, the, same, way, as, the, sciences, this, problem, is, avoided, by, seeing, philosophy, as, an, immature, or, provisional, science, whose, subdisciplines, cease, to, be, philosophy, once, they, have, fully, developed, in, this, sense, philosophy, is, sometimes, described, as, the, midwife, of, the, sciences, other, definitions, focus, on, the, contrast, between, science, and, philosophy, a, common, theme, among, many, such, conceptions, is, that, philosophy, is, concerned, with, meaning, understanding, or, the, clarification, of, language, according, to, one, view, philosophy, is, conceptual, analysis, which, involves, finding, the, necessary, and, sufficient, conditions, for, the, application, of, concepts, another, definition, characterizes, philosophy, as, thinking, about, thinking, to, emphasize, its, self, critical, reflective, nature, a, further, approach, presents, philosophy, as, a, linguistic, therapy, according, to, ludwig, wittgenstein, for, instance, philosophy, aims, at, dispelling, misunderstandings, to, which, humans, are, susceptible, due, to, the, confusing, structure, of, ordinary, language, phenomenologists, such, as, edmund, husserl, characterize, philosophy, as, a, rigorous, science, investigating, essences, they, practice, a, radical, suspension, of, theoretical, assumptions, about, reality, to, get, back, to, the, things, themselves, that, is, as, originally, given, in, experience, they, contend, that, this, base, level, of, experience, provides, the, foundation, for, higher, order, theoretical, knowledge, and, that, one, needs, to, understand, the, former, to, understand, the, latter, an, early, approach, found, in, ancient, greek, and, roman, philosophy, is, that, philosophy, is, the, spiritual, practice, of, developing, one, s, rational, capacities, this, practice, is, an, expression, of, the, philosopher, s, love, of, wisdom, and, has, the, aim, of, improving, one, s, well, being, by, leading, a, reflective, life, for, example, the, stoics, saw, philosophy, as, an, exercise, to, train, the, mind, and, thereby, achieve, eudaimonia, and, flourish, in, life, as, a, discipline, the, history, of, philosophy, aims, to, provide, a, systematic, and, chronological, exposition, of, philosophical, concepts, and, doctrines, some, theorists, see, it, as, a, part, of, intellectual, history, but, it, also, investigates, questions, not, covered, by, intellectual, history, such, as, whether, the, theories, of, past, philosophers, are, true, and, have, remained, philosophically, relevant, the, history, of, philosophy, is, primarily, concerned, with, theories, based, on, rational, inquiry, and, argumentation, some, historians, understand, it, in, a, looser, sense, that, includes, myths, religious, teachings, and, proverbial, lore, influential, traditions, in, the, history, of, philosophy, include, western, arabic, persian, indian, and, chinese, philosophy, other, philosophical, traditions, are, japanese, philosophy, latin, american, philosophy, and, african, philosophy, western, philosophy, originated, in, ancient, greece, in, the, 6th, century, bce, with, the, pre, socratics, they, attempted, to, provide, rational, explanations, of, the, cosmos, as, a, whole, the, philosophy, following, them, was, shaped, by, socrates, 469, 399, bce, plato, 427, 347, bce, and, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, they, expanded, the, range, of, topics, to, questions, like, how, people, should, act, how, to, arrive, at, knowledge, and, what, the, nature, of, reality, and, mind, is, the, later, part, of, the, ancient, period, was, marked, by, the, emergence, of, philosophical, movements, for, example, epicureanism, stoicism, skepticism, and, neoplatonism, the, medieval, period, started, in, the, 5th, century, ce, its, focus, was, on, religious, topics, and, many, thinkers, used, ancient, philosophy, to, explain, and, further, elaborate, christian, doctrines, the, renaissance, period, started, in, the, 14th, century, and, saw, a, renewed, interest, in, schools, of, ancient, philosophy, in, particular, platonism, humanism, also, emerged, in, this, period, the, modern, period, started, in, the, 17th, century, one, of, its, central, concerns, was, how, philosophical, and, scientific, knowledge, are, created, specific, importance, was, given, to, the, role, of, reason, and, sensory, experience, many, of, these, innovations, were, used, in, the, enlightenment, movement, to, challenge, traditional, authorities, several, attempts, to, develop, comprehensive, systems, of, philosophy, were, made, in, the, 19th, century, for, instance, by, german, idealism, and, marxism, influential, developments, in, 20th, century, philosophy, were, the, emergence, and, application, of, formal, logic, the, focus, on, the, role, of, language, as, well, as, pragmatism, and, movements, in, continental, philosophy, like, phenomenology, existentialism, and, post, structuralism, the, 20th, century, saw, a, rapid, expansion, of, academic, philosophy, in, terms, of, the, number, of, philosophical, publications, and, philosophers, working, at, academic, institutions, there, was, also, a, noticeable, growth, in, the, number, of, female, philosophers, but, they, still, remained, underrepresented, arabic, persian, philosophy, arose, in, the, early, 9th, century, ce, as, a, response, to, discussions, in, the, islamic, theological, tradition, its, classical, period, lasted, until, the, 12th, century, ce, and, was, strongly, influenced, by, ancient, greek, philosophers, it, employed, their, ideas, to, elaborate, and, interpret, the, teachings, of, the, quran, al, kindi, 801, 873, ce, is, usually, regarded, as, the, first, philosopher, of, this, tradition, he, translated, and, interpreted, many, works, of, aristotle, and, neoplatonists, in, his, attempt, to, show, that, there, is, a, harmony, between, reason, and, faith, avicenna, 980, 1037, ce, also, followed, this, goal, and, developed, a, comprehensive, philosophical, system, to, provide, a, rational, understanding, of, reality, encompassing, science, religion, and, mysticism, al, ghazali, 1058, 1111, ce, was, a, strong, critic, of, the, idea, that, reason, can, arrive, at, a, true, understanding, of, reality, and, god, he, formulated, a, detailed, critique, of, philosophy, and, tried, to, assign, philosophy, a, more, limited, place, besides, the, teachings, of, the, quran, and, mystical, insight, following, al, ghazali, and, the, end, of, the, classical, period, the, influence, of, philosophical, inquiry, waned, mulla, sadra, 1571, 1636, ce, is, often, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, influential, philosophers, of, the, subsequent, period, the, increasing, influence, of, western, thought, and, institutions, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, gave, rise, to, the, intellectual, movement, of, islamic, modernism, which, aims, to, understand, the, relation, between, traditional, islamic, beliefs, and, modernity, one, of, the, distinguishing, features, of, indian, philosophy, is, that, it, integrates, the, exploration, of, the, nature, of, reality, the, ways, of, arriving, at, knowledge, and, the, spiritual, question, of, how, to, reach, enlightenment, it, started, around, 900, bce, when, the, vedas, were, written, they, are, the, foundational, scriptures, of, hinduism, and, contemplate, issues, concerning, the, relation, between, the, self, and, ultimate, reality, as, well, as, the, question, of, how, souls, are, reborn, based, on, their, past, actions, this, period, also, saw, the, emergence, of, non, vedic, teachings, like, buddhism, and,

later, in, this, period, it, was, systematized, by, adi, shankara, c, 700, 750, ce, who, held, that, everything, is, one, and, that, the, impression, of, a, universe, consisting, of, many, distinct, entities, is, an, illusion, a, slightly, different, perspective, was, defended, by, ramanuja, 1017, 1137, ce, who, founded, the, school, of, vishishtadvaita, vedanta, and, argued, that, individual, entities, are, real, as, aspects, or, parts, of, the, underlying, unity, he, also, helped, to, popularize, the, bhakti, movement, which, taught, devotion, toward, the, divine, as, a, spiritual, path, and, lasted, until, the, 17th, to, 18th, centuries, ce, the, modern, period, began, roughly, 1800, ce, and, was, shaped, by, encounters, with, western, thought, philosophers, tried, to, formulate, comprehensive, systems, to, harmonize, diverse, philosophical, and, religious, teachings, for, example, swami, vivekananda, 1863, 1902, ce, used, the, teachings, of, advaita, vedanta, to, argue, that, all, the, different, religions, are, valid, paths, toward, the, one, divine, chinese, philosophy, is, particularly, interested, in, practical, questions, associated, with, right, social, conduct, government, and, self, cultivation, many, schools, of, thought, emerged, in, the, 6th, century, bce, in, competing, attempts, to, resolve, the, political, turbulence, of, that, period, the, most, prominent, among, them, were, confucianism, and, daoism, confucianism, was, founded, by, confucius, 551, 479, bce, it, focused, on, different, forms, of, moral, virtues, and, explored, how, they, lead, to, harmony, in, society, daoism, was, founded, by, laozi, 6th, century, bce, and, examined, how, humans, can, live, in, harmony, with, nature, by, following, the, dao, or, the, natural, order, of, the, universe, other, influential, early, schools, of, thought, were, mohism, which, developed, an, early, form, of, altruistic, consequentialism, and, legalism, which, emphasized, the, importance, of, a, strong, state, and, strict, laws, buddhism, was, introduced, to, china, in, the, 1st, century, ce, and, diversified, into, new, forms, of, buddhism, starting, in, the, 3rd, century, ce, the, school, of, xuanxue, emerged, it, interpreted, earlier, daoist, works, with, a, specific, emphasis, on, metaphysical, explanations, neo, confucianism, developed, in, the, 11th, century, ce, it, systematized, previous, confucian, teachings, and, sought, a, metaphysical, foundation, of, ethics, the, modern, period, in, chinese, philosophy, began, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, was, shaped, by, the, influence, of, and, reactions, to, western, philosophy, the, emergence, of, chinese, marxism, which, focused, on, class, struggle, socialism, and, communism, resulted, in, a, significant, transformation, of, the, political, landscape, another, development, was, the, emergence, of, new, confucianism, which, aims, to, modernize, and, rethink, confucian, teachings, to, explore, their, compatibility, with, democratic, ideals, and, modern, science, traditional, japanese, philosophy, assimilated, and, synthesized, ideas, from, different, traditions, including, the, indigenous, shinto, religion, and, chinese, and, indian, thought, in, the, forms, of, confucianism, and, buddhism, both, of, which, entered, japan, in, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, its, practice, is, characterized, by, active, interaction, with, reality, rather, than, disengaged, examination, neo, confucianism, became, an, influential, school, of, thought, in, the, 16th, century, and, the, following, edo, period, and, prompted, a, greater, focus, on, language, and, the, natural, world, the, kyoto, school, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, and, integrated, eastern, spirituality, with, western, philosophy, in, its, exploration, of, concepts, like, absolute, nothingness, zettai, mu, place, basho, and, the, self, latin, american, philosophy, in, the, pre, colonial, period, was, practiced, by, indigenous, civilizations, and, explored, questions, concerning, the, nature, of, reality, and, the, role, of, humans, it, has, similarities, to, indigenous, north, american, philosophy, which, covered, themes, such, as, the, interconnectedness, of, all, things, latin, american, philosophy, during, the, colonial, period, starting, around, 1550, was, dominated, by,

20th, century, it, discusses, topics, such, as, ethnophilosophy, n, gritude, pan, africanism, marxism, postcolonialism, the, role, of, cultural, identity, and, the, critique, of, eurocentrism, philosophical, questions, can, be, grouped, into, several, branches, these, groupings, allow, philosophers, to, focus, on, a, set, of, similar, topics, and, interact, with, other, thinkers, who, are, interested, in, the, same, questions, epistemology, ethics, logic, and, metaphysics, are, sometimes, listed, as, the, main, branches, there, are, many, other, subfields, besides, them, and, the, different, divisions, are, neither, exhaustive, nor, mutually, exclusive, for, example, political, philosophy, ethics, and, aesthetics, are, sometimes, linked, under, the, general, heading, of, value, theory, as, they, investigate, normative, or, evaluative, aspects, furthermore, philosophical, inquiry, sometimes, overlaps, with, other, disciplines, in, the, natural, and, social, sciences, religion, and, mathematics, epistemology, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, that, studies, knowledge, it, is, also, known, as, theory, of, knowledge, and, aims, to, understand, what, knowledge, is, how, it, arises, what, its, limits, are, and, what, value, it, has, it, further, examines, the, nature, of, truth, belief, justification, and, rationality, some, of, the, questions, addressed, by, epistemologists, include, by, what, method, s, can, one, acquire, knowledge, how, is, truth, established, and, can, we, prove, causal, relations, epistemology, is, primarily, interested, in, declarative, knowledge, or, knowledge, of, facts, like, knowing, that, princess, diana, died, in, 1997, but, it, also, investigates, practical, knowledge, such, as, knowing, how, to, ride, a, bicycle, and, knowledge, by, acquaintance, for, example, knowing, a, celebrity, personally, one, area, in, epistemology, is, the, analysis, of, knowledge, it, assumes, that, declarative, knowledge, is, a, combination, of, different, parts, and, attempts, to, identify, what, those, parts, are, an, influential, theory, in, this, area, claims, that, knowledge, has, three, components, it, is, a, belief, that, is, justified, and, true, this, theory, is, controversial, and, the, difficulties, associated, with, it, are, known, as, the, gettier, problem, alternative, views, state, that, knowledge, requires, additional, components, like, the, absence, of, luck, different, components, like, the, manifestation, of, cognitive, virtues, instead, of, justification, or, they, deny, that, knowledge, can, be, analyzed, in, terms, of, other, phenomena, another, area, in, epistemology, asks, how, people, acquire, knowledge, often, discussed, sources, of, knowledge, are, perception, introspection, memory, inference, and, testimony, according, to, empiricists, all, knowledge, is, based, on, some, form, of, experience, rationalists, reject, this, view, and, hold, that, some, forms, of, knowledge, like, innate, knowledge, are, not, acquired, through, experience, the, regress, problem, is, a, common, issue, in, relation, to, the, sources, of, knowledge, and, the, justification, they, offer, it, is, based, on, the, idea, that, beliefs, require, some, kind, of, reason, or, evidence, to, be, justified, the, problem, is, that, the, source, of, justification, may, itself, be, in, need, of, another, source, of, justification, this, leads, to, an, infinite, regress, or, circular, reasoning, foundationalists, avoid, this, conclusion, by, arguing, that, some, sources, can, provide, justification, without, requiring, justification, themselves, another, solution, is, presented, by, coherentists, who, state, that, a, belief, is, justified, if, it, coheres, with, other, beliefs, of, the, person, many, discussions, in, epistemology, touch, on, the, topic, of, philosophical, skepticism, which, raises, doubts, about, some, or, all, claims, to, knowledge, these, doubts, are, often, based, on, the, idea, that, knowledge, requires, absolute, certainty, and, that, humans, are, unable, to, acquire, it, ethics, also, known, as, moral, philosophy, studies, what, constitutes, right, conduct, it, is, also, concerned, with, the, moral, evaluation, of, character, traits, and, institutions, it, explores, what, the, standards, of, morality, are, and, how, to, live, a, good, life, philosophical, ethics, addresses, such, basic, questions, as, are, moral, obligations, relative, which, has, priority, well, being, or, obligation, and, what, gives, life, meaning, the, main, branches, of, ethics, are, meta, ethics, normative, ethics, and, applied, ethics, meta, ethics, asks, abstract, questions, about, the, nature, and, sources, of, morality, it, analyzes, the, meaning, of, ethical, concepts, like, right, action, and, obligation, it, also, investigates, whether, ethical, theories, can, be, true, in, an, absolute, sense, and, how, to, acquire, knowledge, of, them, normative, ethics, encompasses, general, theories, of, how, to, distinguish, between, right, and, wrong, conduct, it, helps, guide, moral, decisions, by, examining, what, moral, obligations, and, rights, people, have, applied, ethics, studies, the, consequences, of, the, general, theories, developed, by, normative, ethics, in, specific, situations, for, example, in, the, workplace, or, for, medical, treatments, within, contemporary, normative, ethics, consequentialism, deontology, and, virtue, ethics, are, influential, schools, of, thought, consequentialists, judge, actions, based, on, their, consequences, one, such, view, is, utilitarianism, which, argues, that, actions, should, increase, overall, happiness, while, minimizing, suffering, deontologists, judge, actions, based, on, whether, they, follow, moral, duties, such, as, abstaining, from, lying, or, killing, according, to, them, what, matters, is, that, actions, are, in, tune, with, those, duties, and, not, what, consequences, they, have, virtue, theorists, judge, actions, based, on, how, the, moral, character, of, the, agent, is, expressed, according, to, this, view, actions, should, conform, to, what, an, ideally, virtuous, agent, would, do, by, manifesting, virtues, like, generosity, and, honesty, logic, is, the, study, of, correct, reasoning, it, aims, to, understand, how, to, distinguish, good, from, bad, arguments, it, is, usually, divided, into, formal, and, informal, logic, formal, logic, uses, artificial, languages, with, a, precise, symbolic, representation, to, investigate, arguments, in, its, search, for, exact, criteria, it, examines, the, structure, of, arguments, to, determine, whether, they, are, correct, or, incorrect, informal, logic, uses, non, formal, criteria, and, standards, to, assess, the, correctness, of, arguments, it, relies, on, additional, factors, such, as, content, and, context, logic, examines, a, variety, of, arguments, deductive, arguments, are, mainly, studied, by, formal, logic, an, argument, is, deductively, valid, if, the, truth, of, its, premises, ensures, the, truth, of, its, conclusion, deductively, valid, arguments, follow, a, rule, of, inference, like, modus, ponens, which, has, the, following, logical, form, p, if, p, then, q, therefore, q, an, example, is, the, argument, today, is, sunday, if, today, is, sunday, then, i, don, t, have, to, go, to, work, today, therefore, i, don, t, have, to, go, to, work, today, the, premises, of, non, deductive, arguments, also, support, their, conclusion, although, this, support, does, not, guarantee, that, the, conclusion, is, true, one, form, is, inductive, reasoning, it, starts, from, a, set, of, individual, cases, and, uses, generalization, to, arrive, at, a, universal, law, governing, all, cases, an, example, is, the, inference, that, all, ravens, are, black, based, on, observations, of, many, individual, black, ravens, another, form, is, abductive, reasoning, it, starts, from, an, observation, and, concludes, that, the, best, explanation, of, this, observation, must, be, true, this, happens, for, example, when, a, doctor, diagnoses, a, disease, based, on, the, observed, symptoms, logic, also, investigates, incorrect, forms, of, reasoning, they, are, called, fallacies, and, are, divided, into, formal, and, informal, fallacies, based, on, whether, the, source, of, the, error, lies, only, in, the, form, of, the, argument, or, also, in, its, content, and, context, metaphysics, is, the, study, of, the, most, general, features, of, reality, such, as, existence, objects, and, their, properties, wholes, and, their, parts, space, and, time, events, and, causation, there, are, disagreements, about, the, precise, definition, of, the, term, and, its, meaning, has, changed, throughout, the, ages, metaphysicians, attempt, to, answer, basic, questions, including, why, is, there, something, rather, than, nothing, of, what, does, reality, ultimately, consist, and, are, humans, free, metaphysics, is, sometimes, divided, into, general, metaphysics, and, specific, or, special, metaphysics, general, metaphysics, investigates, being, as, such, it, examines, the, features, that, all, entities, have, in, common, specific, metaphysics, is, interested, in, different, kinds, of, being, the, features, they, have, and, how, they, differ, from, one, another, an, important, area, in, metaphysics, is, ontology, some, theorists, identify, it, with, general, metaphysics, ontology, investigates, concepts, like, being, becoming, and, reality, it, studies, the, categories, of, being, and, asks, what, exists, on, the, most, fundamental, level, another, subfield, of, metaphysics, is, philosophical, cosmology, it, is, interested, in, the, essence, of, the, world, as, a, whole, it, asks, questions, including, whether, the, universe, has, a, beginning, and, an, end, and, whether, it, was, created, by, something, else, a, key, topic, in, metaphysics, concerns, the, question, of, whether, reality, only, consists, of, physical, things, like, matter, and, energy, alternative, suggestions, are, that, mental, entities, such, as, souls, and, experiences, and, abstract, entities, such, as, numbers, exist, apart, from, physical, things, another, topic, in, metaphysics, concerns, the, problem, of, identity, one, question, is, how, much, an, entity, can, change, while, still, remaining, the, same, entity, according, to, one, view, entities, have, essential, and, accidental, features, they, can, change, their, accidental, features, but, they, cease, to, be, the, same, entity, if, they, lose, an, essential, feature, a, central, distinction, in, metaphysics, is, between, particulars, and, universals, universals, like, the, color, red, can, exist, at, different, locations, at, the, same, time, this, is, not, the, case, for, particulars, including, individual, persons, or, specific, objects, other, metaphysical, questions, are, whether, the, past, fully, determines, the, present, and, what, implications, this, would, have, for, the, existence, of, free, will, there, are, many, other, subfields, of, philosophy, besides, its, core, branches, some, of, the, most, prominent, are, aesthetics, philosophy, of, language, philosophy, of, mind, philosophy, of, religion, philosophy, of, science, and, political, philosophy, aesthetics, in, the, philosophical, sense, is, the, field, that, studies, the, nature, and, appreciation, of, beauty, and, other, aesthetic, properties, like, the, sublime, although, it, is, often, treated, together, with, the, philosophy, of, art, aesthetics, is, a, broader, category, that, encompasses, other, aspects, of, experience, such, as, natural, beauty, in, a, more, general, sense, aesthetics, is, critical, reflection, on, art, culture, and, nature, a, key, question, in, aesthetics, is, whether, beauty, is, an, objective, feature, of, entities, or, a, subjective, aspect, of, experience, aesthetic, philosophers, also, investigate, the, nature, of, aesthetic, experiences, and, judgments, further, topics, include, the, essence, of, works, of, art, and, the, processes, involved, in, creating, them, the, philosophy, of, language, studies, the, nature, and, function, of, language, it, examines, the, concepts, of, meaning, reference, and, truth, it, aims, to, answer, questions, such, as, how, words, are, related, to, things, and, how, language, affects, human, thought, and, understanding, it, is, closely, related, to, the, disciplines, of, logic, and, linguistics, the, philosophy, of, language, rose, to, particular, prominence, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, analytic, philosophy, due, to, the, works, of, frege, and, russell, one, of, its, central, topics, is, to, understand, how, sentences, get, their, meaning, there, are, two, broad, theoretical, camps, those, emphasizing, the, formal, truth, conditions, of, sentences, and, those, investigating, circumstances, that, determine, when, it, is, suitable, to, use, a, sentence, the, latter, of, which, is, associated, with, speech, act, theory, the, philosophy, of, mind, studies, the, nature, of, mental, phenomena, and, how, they, are, related, to, the, physical, world, it, aims, to, understand, different, types, of, conscious, and, unconscious, mental, states, like, beliefs, desires, intentions, feelings, sensations, and, free, will, an, influential, intuition, in, the, philosophy, of, mind, is, that, there, is, a, distinction, between, the, inner, experience, of, objects, and, their, existence, in, the, external, world, the, mind, body, problem, is, the, problem, of, explaining, how, these, two, types, of, thing, mind, and, matter, are, related, the, main, traditional, responses, are, materialism, which, assumes, that, matter, is, more, fundamental, idealism, which, assumes, that, mind, is, more, fundamental, and, dualism, which, assumes, that, mind, and, matter, are, distinct, types, of, entities, in, contemporary, philosophy, another, common, view, is, functionalism, which, understands, mental, states, in, terms, of, the, functional, or, causal, roles, they, play, the, mind, body, problem, is, closely, related, to, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, which, asks, how, the, physical, brain, can, produce, qualitatively, subjective, experiences, the, philosophy, of, religion, investigates, the, basic, concepts, assumptions, and, arguments, associated, with, religion, it, critically, reflects, on, what, religion, is, how, to, define, the, divine, and, whether, one, or, more, gods, exist, it, also, includes, the, discussion, of, worldviews, that, reject, religious, doctrines, further, questions, addressed, by, the, philosophy, of, religion, are, how, are, we, to, interpret, religious, language, if, not, literally, is, divine, omniscience, compatible, with, free, will, and, are, the, great, variety, of, world, religions, in, some, way, compatible, in, spite, of, their, apparently, contradictory, theological, claims, it, includes, topics, from, nearly, all, branches, of, philosophy, it, differs, from, theology, since, theological, debates, typically, take, place, within, one, religious, tradition, whereas, debates, in, the, philosophy, of, religion, transcend, any, particular, set, of, theological, assumptions, the, philosophy, of, science, examines, the, fundamental, concepts, assumptions, and, problems, associated, with, science, it, reflects, on, what, science, is, and, how, to, distinguish, it, from, pseudoscience, it, investigates, the, methods, employed, by, scientists, how, their, application, can, result, in, knowledge, and, on, what, assumptions, they, are, based, it, also, studies, the, purpose, and, implications, of, science, some, of, its, questions, are, what, counts, as, an, adequate, explanation, is, a, scientific, law, anything, more, than, a, description, of, a, regularity, and, can, some, special, sciences, be, explained, entirely, in, the, terms, of, a, more, general, science, it, is, a, vast, field, that, is, commonly, divided, into, the, philosophy, of, the, natural, sciences, and, the, philosophy, of, the, social, sciences, with, further, subdivisions, for, each, of, the, individual, sciences, under, these, headings, how, these, branches, are, related, to, one, another, is, also, a, question, in, the, philosophy, of, science, many, of, its, philosophical, issues, overlap, with, the, fields, of, metaphysics, or, epistemology, political, philosophy, is, the, philosophical, inquiry, into, the, fundamental, principles, and, ideas, governing, political, systems, and, societies, it, examines, the, basic, concepts, assumptions, and, arguments, in, the, field, of, politics, it, investigates, the, nature, and, purpose, of, government, and, compares, its, different, forms, it, further, asks, under, what, circumstances, the, use, of, political, power, is, legitimate, rather, than, a, form, of, simple, violence, in, this, regard, it, is, concerned, with, the, distribution, of, political, power, social, and, material, goods, and, legal, rights, other, topics, are, justice, liberty, equality, sovereignty, and, nationalism, political, philosophy, involves, a, general, inquiry, into, normative, matters, and, differs, in, this, respect, from, political, science, which, aims, to, provide, empirical, descriptions, of, actually, existing, states, political, philosophy, is, often, treated, as, a, subfield, of, ethics, influential, schools, of, thought, in, political, philosophy, are, liberalism, conservativism, socialism, and, anarchism, methods, of, philosophy, are, ways, of, conducting, philosophical, inquiry, they, include, techniques, for, arriving, at, philosophical, knowledge, and, justifying, philosophical, claims, as, well, as, principles, used, for, choosing, between, competing, theories, a, great, variety, of, methods, have, been, employed, throughout, the, history, of, philosophy, many, of, them, differ, significantly, from, the, methods, used, in, the, natural, sciences, in, that, they, do, not, use, experimental, data, obtained, through, measuring, equipment, the, choice, of, one, s, method, usually, has, important, implications, both, for, how, philosophical, theories, are, constructed, and, for, the, arguments, cited, for, or, against, them, this, choice, is, often, guided, by, epistemological, considerations, about, what, constitutes, philosophical, evidence, methodological, disagreements, can, cause, conflicts, among, philosophical, theories, or, about, the, answers, to, philosophical, questions, the, discovery, of, new, methods, has, often, had, important, consequences, both, for, how, philosophers, conduct, their, research, and, for, what, claims, they, defend, some, philosophers, engage, in, most, of, their, theorizing, using, one, particular, method, while, others, employ, a, wider, range, of, methods, based, on, which, one, fits, the, specific, problem, investigated, best, conceptual, analysis, is, a, common, method, in, analytic, philosophy, it, aims, to, clarify, the, meaning, of, concepts, by, analyzing, them, into, their, component, parts, another, method, often, employed, in, analytic, philosophy, is, based, on, common, sense, it, starts, with, commonly, accepted, beliefs, and, tries, to, draw, unexpected, conclusions, from, them, which, it, often, employs, in, a, negative, sense, to, criticize, philosophical, theories, that, are, too, far, removed, from, how, the, average, person, sees, the, issue, it, is, similar, to, how, ordinary, language, philosophy, approaches, philosophical, questions, by, investigating, how, ordinary, language, is, used, various, methods, in, philosophy, give, particular, importance, to, intuitions, that, is, non, inferential, impressions, about, the, correctness, of, specific, claims, or, general, principles, for, example, they, play, an, important, role, in, thought, experiments, which, employ, counterfactual, thinking, to, evaluate, the, possible, consequences, of, an, imagined, situation, these, anticipated, consequences, can, then, be, used, to, confirm, or, refute, philosophical, theories, the, method, of, reflective, equilibrium, also, employs, intuitions, it, seeks, to, form, a, coherent, position, on, a, certain, issue, by, examining, all, the, relevant, beliefs, and, intuitions, some, of, which, often, have, to, be, deemphasized, or, reformulated, to, arrive, at, a, coherent, perspective, pragmatists, stress, the, significance, of, concrete, practical, consequences, for, assessing, whether, a, philosophical, theory, is, true, according, to, the, pragmatic, maxim, as, formulated, by, charles, sanders, peirce, the, idea, a, person, has, of, an, object, is, nothing, more, than, the, totality, of, practical, consequences, they, associate, with, this, object, pragmatists, have, also, used, this, method, to, expose, disagreements, as, merely, verbal, that, is, to, show, they, make, no, genuine, difference, on, the, level, of, consequences, phenomenologists, seek, knowledge, of, the, realm, of, appearance, and, the, structure, of, human, experience, they, insist, upon, the, first, personal, character, of, all, experience, and, proceed, by, suspending, theoretical, judgments, about, the, external, world, this, technique, of, phenomenological, reduction, is, known, as, bracketing, or, epoch, the, goal, is, to, give, an, unbiased, description, of, the, appearances, of, things, methodological, naturalism, places, great, emphasis, on, the, empirical, approach, and, the, resulting, theories, found, in, the, natural, sciences, in, this, way, it, contrasts, with, methodologies, that, give, more, weight, to, pure, reasoning, and, introspection, philosophy, is, closely, related, to, many, other, fields, it, is, sometimes, understood, as, a, metadiscipline, that, clarifies, their, nature, and, limits, it, does, this, by, critically, examining, their, basic, concepts, background, assumptions, and, methods, in, this, regard, it, plays, a, key, role, in, providing, an, interdisciplinary, perspective, it, bridges, the, gap, between, different, disciplines, by, analyzing, which, concepts, and, problems, they, have, in, common, it, shows, how, they, overlap, while, also, delimiting, their, scope, historically, most, of, the, individual, sciences, originated, from, philosophy, the, influence, of, philosophy, is, felt, in, several, fields, that, require, difficult, practical, decisions, in, medicine, philosophical, considerations, related, to, bioethics, affect, issues, like, whether, an, embryo, is, already, a, person, and, under, what, conditions, abortion, is, morally, permissible, a, closely, related, philosophical, problem, is, how, humans, should, treat, other, animals, for, instance, whether, it, is, acceptable, to, use, non, human, animals, as, food, or, for, research, experiments, in, relation, to, business, and, professional, life, philosophy, has, contributed, by, providing, ethical, frameworks, they, contain, guidelines, on, which, business, practices, are, morally, acceptable, and, cover, the, issue, of, corporate, social, responsibility, philosophical, inquiry, is, relevant, to, many, fields, that, are, concerned, with, what, to, believe, and, how, to, arrive, at, evidence, for, one, s, beliefs, this, is, a, key, issue, for, the, sciences, which, have, as, one, of, their, prime, objectives, the, creation, of, scientific, knowledge, scientific, knowledge, is, based, on, empirical, evidence, but, it, is, often, not, clear, whether, empirical, observations, are, neutral, or, already, include, theoretical, assumptions, a, closely, connected, problem, is, whether, the, available, evidence, is, sufficient, to, decide, between, competing, theories, epistemological, problems, in, relation, to, the, law, include, what, counts, as, evidence, and, how, much, evidence, is, required, to, find, a, person, guilty, of, a, crime, a, related, issue, in, journalism, is, how, to, ensure, truth, and, objectivity, when, reporting, on, events, in, the, fields, of, theology, and, religion, there, are, many, doctrines, associated, with, the, existence, and, nature, of, god, as, well, as, rules, governing, correct, behavior, a, key, issue, is, whether, a, rational, person, should, believe, these, doctrines, for, example, whether, revelation, in, the, form, of, holy, books, and, religious, experiences, of, the, divine, are, sufficient, evidence, for, these, beliefs, philosophy, in, the, form, of, logic, has, been, influential, in, the, fields, of, mathematics, and, computer, science, further, fields, influenced, by, philosophy, include, psychology, sociology, linguistics, education, and, the, arts, the, close, relation, between, philosophy, and, other, fields, in, the, contemporary, period, is, reflected, in, the, fact, that, many, philosophy, graduates, go, on, to, work, in, related, fields, rather, than, in, philosophy, itself, in, the, field, of, politics, philosophy, addresses, issues, such, as, how, to, assess, whether, a, government, policy, is, just, philosophical, ideas, have, prepared, and, shaped, various, political, developments, for, example, ideals, formulated, in, enlightenment, philosophy, laid, the, foundation, for, constitutional, democracy, and, played, a, role, in, the, american, revolution, and, the, french, revolution, marxist, philosophy, and, its, exposition, of, communism, was, one, of, the, factors, in, the, russian, revolution, and, the, chinese, communist, revolution, in, india, mahatma, gandhi, s, philosophy, of, non, violence, shaped, the, indian, independence, movement, an, example, of, the, cultural, and, critical, role, of, philosophy, is, found, in, its, influence, on, the, feminist, movement, through, philosophers, such, as, mary, wollstonecraft, simone, de, beauvoir, and, judith, butler, it, has, shaped, the, understanding, of, key, concepts, in, feminism, for, instance, the, meaning, of, gender, how, it, differs, from, biological, sex, and, what, role, it, plays, in, the, formation, of, personal, identity, philosophers, have, also, investigated, the, concepts, of, justice, and, equality, and, their, implications, with, respect, to, the, prejudicial, treatment, of, women, in, male, dominated, societies, the, idea, that, philosophy, is, useful, for, many, aspects, of, life, and, society, is, sometimes, rejected, according, to, one, such, view, philosophy, is, mainly, undertaken, for, its, own, sake, and, does, not, make, significant, contributions, to, existing, practices, or, external, goals
