https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism
in, ethical, philosophy, utilitarianism, is, a, family, of, normative, ethical, theories, that, prescribe, actions, that, maximize, happiness, and, well, being, for, the, affected, individuals, in, other, words, utilitarian, ideas, encourage, actions, that, ensure, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, although, different, varieties, of, utilitarianism, admit, different, characterizations, the, basic, idea, behind, all, of, them, is, in, some, sense, to, maximize, utility, which, is, often, defined, in, terms, of, well, being, or, related, concepts, for, instance, jeremy, bentham, the, founder, of, utilitarianism, described, utility, as, the, capacity, of, actions, or, objects, to, produce, benefits, such, as, pleasure, happiness, and, good, or, to, prevent, harm, such, as, pain, and, unhappiness, to, those, affected, utilitarianism, is, a, version, of, consequentialism, which, states, that, the, consequences, of, any, action, are, the, only, standard, of, right, and, wrong, unlike, other, forms, of, consequentialism, such, as, egoism, and, altruism, utilitarianism, considers, either, the, interests, of, all, humanity, and, or, all, sentient, beings, equally, proponents, of, utilitarianism, have, disagreed, on, a, number, of, issues, such, as, whether, actions, should, be, chosen, based, on, their, likely, results, act, utilitarianism, or, whether, agents, should, conform, to, rules, that, maximize, utility, rule, utilitarianism, there, is, also, disagreement, as, to, whether, total, utility, total, utilitarianism, or, average, utility, average, utilitarianism, should, be, maximized, the, seeds, of, the, theory, can, be, found, in, the, hedonists, aristippus, and, epicurus, who, viewed, happiness, as, the, only, good, the, consequentialism, of, the, ancient, chinese, philosopher, mozi, who, developed, a, theory, to, maximize, benefit, and, minimize, harm, and, in, the, work, of, the, medieval, indian, philosopher, shantideva, the, tradition, of, modern, utilitarianism, began, with, jeremy, bentham, and, continued, with, such, philosophers, as, john, stuart, mill, henry, sidgwick, r, m, hare, and, peter, singer, the, concept, has, been, applied, towards, social, welfare, economics, questions, of, justice, the, crisis, of, global, poverty, the, ethics, of, raising, animals, for, food, and, the, importance, of, avoiding, existential, risks, to, humanity, benthamism, the, utilitarian, philosophy, founded, by, jeremy, bentham, was, substantially, modified, by, his, successor, john, stuart, mill, who, popularized, the, term, utilitarianism, in, 1861, mill, acknowledged, in, a, footnote, that, though, bentham, believed, himself, to, be, the, first, person, who, brought, the, word, utilitarian, into, use, he, did, not, invent, it, rather, he, adopted, it, from, a, passing, expression, in, john, galt, s, 1821, novel, annals, of, the, parish, however, mill, seems, to, have, been, unaware, that, bentham, had, used, the, term, utilitarian, in, his, 1781, letter, to, george, wilson, and, his, 1802, letter, to, tienne, dumont, the, importance, of, happiness, as, an, end, for, humans, has, long, been, argued, forms, of, hedonism, were, put, forward, by, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, aristippus, and, epicurus, aristotle, argued, that, eudaimonia, is, the, highest, human, good, augustine, wrote, that, all, men, agree, in, desiring, the, last, end, which, is, happiness, the, idea, that, conduct, should, to, be, judged, by, its, consequences, also, existed, within, the, ancient, world, consequentialist, theories, were, first, developed, by, the, ancient, chinese, philosopher, mozi, who, proposed, a, system, that, sought, to, maximize, benefit, and, eliminate, harm, mohist, consequentialism, advocated, communitarian, moral, goods, including, political, stability, population, growth, and, wealth, but, did, not, support, the, utilitarian, notion, of, maximizing, individual, happiness, utilitarian, ideas, can, also, be, found, in, the, work, of, medieval, philosophers, in, medieval, india, the, 8th, century, indian, philosopher, ntideva, wrote, that, we, ought, to, stop, all, the, present, and, future, pain, and, suffering, of, all, sentient, beings, and, to, bring, about, all, present, and, future, pleasure, and, happiness, in, medieval, europe, happiness, was, explored, in, depth, by, thomas, aquinas, in, his, summa, theologica, during, the, renaissance, consequentialist, ideas, are, present, in, the, work, of, political, philosophy, of, niccol, machiavelli, utilitarianism, as, a, distinct, ethical, position, only, emerged, in, the, 18th, century, and, although, it, is, usually, thought, to, have, begun, with, jeremy, bentham, there, were, earlier, writers, who, presented, theories, that, were, strikingly, similar, francis, hutcheson, first, introduced, a, key, utilitarian, phrase, in, an, inquiry, into, the, original, of, our, ideas, of, beauty, and, virtue, 1725, when, choosing, the, most, moral, action, the, amount, of, virtue, in, a, particular, action, is, proportionate, to, the, number, of, people, it, brings, happiness, to, in, the, same, way, moral, evil, or, vice, is, proportionate, to, the, number, of, people, made, to, suffer, the, best, action, is, the, one, that, procures, the, greatest, happiness, of, the, greatest, numbers, and, the, worst, is, the, one, that, causes, the, most, misery, in, the, first, three, editions, of, the, book, hutcheson, included, various, mathematical, algorithms, to, compute, the, morality, of, any, actions, in, doing, so, he, pre, figured, the, hedonic, calculus, of, bentham, some, claim, that, john, gay, developed, the, first, systematic, theory, of, utilitarian, ethics, in, concerning, the, fundamental, principle, of, virtue, or, morality, 1731, gay, argues, that, happiness, private, happiness, is, the, proper, or, ultimate, end, of, all, our, actions, each, particular, action, may, be, said, to, have, its, proper, and, peculiar, end, but, they, still, tend, or, ought, to, tend, to, something, farther, as, is, evident, from, hence, viz, that, a, man, may, ask, and, expect, a, reason, why, either, of, them, are, pursued, now, to, ask, the, reason, of, any, action, or, pursuit, is, only, to, enquire, into, the, end, of, it, but, to, expect, a, reason, i, e, an, end, to, be, assigned, for, an, ultimate, end, is, absurd, to, ask, why, i, pursue, happiness, will, admit, of, no, other, answer, than, an, explanation, of, the, terms, this, pursuit, of, happiness, is, given, a, theological, basis, now, it, is, evident, from, the, nature, of, god, viz, his, being, infinitely, happy, in, himself, from, all, eternity, and, from, his, goodness, manifested, in, his, works, that, he, could, have, no, other, design, in, creating, mankind, than, their, happiness, and, therefore, he, wills, their, happiness, therefore, the, means, of, their, happiness, therefore, that, my, behaviour, as, far, as, it, may, be, a, means, of, the, happiness, of, mankind, should, be, such, thus, the, will, of, god, is, the, immediate, criterion, of, virtue, and, the, happiness, of, mankind, the, criterion, of, the, will, of, god, and, therefore, the, happiness, of, mankind, may, be, said, to, be, the, criterion, of, virtue, but, once, removed, and, i, am, to, do, whatever, lies, in, my, power, towards, promoting, the, happiness, of, mankind, in, an, enquiry, concerning, the, principles, of, morals, 1751, david, hume, writes, in, all, determinations, of, morality, this, circumstance, of, public, utility, is, ever, principally, in, view, and, wherever, disputes, arise, either, in, philosophy, or, common, life, concerning, the, bounds, of, duty, the, question, cannot, by, any, means, be, decided, with, greater, certainty, than, by, ascertaining, on, any, side, the, true, interests, of, mankind, if, any, false, opinion, embraced, from, appearances, has, been, found, to, prevail, as, soon, as, farther, experience, and, sounder, reasoning, have, given, us, juster, notions, of, human, affairs, we, retract, our, first, sentiment, and, adjust, anew, the, boundaries, of, moral, good, and, evil, gay, s, theological, utilitarianism, was, developed, and, popularized, by, william, paley, it, has, been, claimed, that, paley, was, not, a, very, original, thinker, and, that, the, philosophies, in, his, treatise, on, ethics, is, an, assemblage, of, ideas, developed, by, others, and, is, presented, to, be, learned, by, students, rather, than, debated, by, colleagues, nevertheless, his, book, the, principles, of, moral, and, political, philosophy, 1785, was, a, required, text, at, cambridge, and, smith, 1954, says, that, paley, s, writings, were, once, as, well, known, in, american, colleges, as, were, the, readers, and, spellers, of, william, mcguffey, and, noah, webster, in, the, elementary, schools, schneewind, 1977, writes, that, utilitarianism, first, became, widely, known, in, england, through, the, work, of, william, paley, the, now, forgotten, significance, of, paley, can, be, judged, from, the, title, of, thomas, rawson, birks, s, 1874, work, modern, utilitarianism, or, the, systems, of, paley, bentham, and, mill, examined, and, compared, apart, from, restating, that, happiness, as, an, end, is, grounded, in, the, nature, of, god, paley, also, discusses, the, place, of, rules, writing, ctions, are, to, be, estimated, by, their, tendency, whatever, is, expedient, is, right, it, is, the, utility, of, any, moral, rule, alone, which, constitutes, the, obligation, of, it, but, to, all, this, there, seems, a, plain, objection, viz, that, many, actions, are, useful, which, no, man, in, his, senses, will, allow, to, be, right, there, are, occasions, in, which, the, hand, of, the, assassin, would, be, very, useful, the, true, answer, is, this, that, these, actions, after, all, are, not, useful, and, for, that, reason, and, that, alone, are, not, right, to, see, this, point, perfectly, it, must, be, observed, that, the, bad, consequences, of, actions, are, twofold, particular, and, general, the, particular, bad, consequence, of, an, action, is, the, mischief, which, that, single, action, directly, and, immediately, occasions, the, general, bad, consequence, is, the, violation, of, some, necessary, or, useful, general, rule, you, cannot, permit, one, action, and, forbid, another, without, showing, a, difference, between, them, consequently, the, same, sort, of, actions, must, be, generally, permitted, or, generally, forbidden, where, therefore, the, general, permission, of, them, would, be, pernicious, it, becomes, necessary, to, lay, down, and, support, the, rule, which, generally, forbids, them, bentham, s, book, an, introduction, to, the, principles, of, morals, and, legislation, was, printed, in, 1780, but, not, published, until, 1789, it, is, possible, that, bentham, was, spurred, on, to, publish, after, he, saw, the, success, of, paley, s, principles, of, moral, and, political, philosophy, though, bentham, s, book, was, not, an, immediate, success, his, ideas, were, spread, further, when, pierre, tienne, louis, dumont, translated, edited, selections, from, a, variety, of, bentham, s, manuscripts, into, french, trait, de, l, gislation, civile, et, p, nale, was, published, in, 1802, and, then, later, retranslated, back, into, english, by, hildreth, as, the, theory, of, legislation, although, by, this, time, significant, portions, of, dumont, s, work, had, already, been, retranslated, and, incorporated, into, sir, john, bowring, s, edition, of, bentham, s, works, which, was, issued, in, parts, between, 1838, and, 1843, perhaps, aware, that, francis, hutcheson, eventually, removed, his, algorithms, for, calculating, the, greatest, happiness, because, they, appear, d, useless, and, were, disagreeable, to, some, readers, bentham, contends, that, there, is, nothing, novel, or, unwarranted, about, his, method, for, in, all, this, there, is, nothing, but, what, the, practice, of, mankind, wheresoever, they, have, a, clear, view, of, their, own, interest, is, perfectly, conformable, to, rosen, 2003, warns, that, descriptions, of, utilitarianism, can, bear, little, resemblance, historically, to, utilitarians, like, bentham, and, j, s, mill, and, can, be, more, a, crude, version, of, act, utilitarianism, conceived, in, the, twentieth, century, as, a, straw, man, to, be, attacked, and, rejected, it, is, a, mistake, to, think, that, bentham, is, not, concerned, with, rules, his, seminal, work, is, concerned, with, the, principles, of, legislation, and, the, hedonic, calculus, is, introduced, with, the, words, pleasures, then, and, the, avoidance, of, pains, are, the, ends, that, the, legislator, has, in, view, in, chapter, vii, bentham, says, the, business, of, government, is, to, promote, the, happiness, of, the, society, by, punishing, and, rewarding, in, proportion, as, an, act, tends, to, disturb, that, happiness, in, proportion, as, the, tendency, of, it, is, pernicious, will, be, the, demand, it, creates, for, punishment, bentham, s, work, opens, with, a, statement, of, the, principle, of, utility, nature, has, placed, mankind, under, the, governance, of, two, sovereign, masters, pain, and, pleasure, it, is, for, them, alone, to, point, out, what, we, ought, to, do, by, the, principle, of, utility, is, meant, that, principle, which, approves, or, disapproves, of, every, action, whatsoever, according, to, the, tendency, it, appears, to, have, to, augment, or, diminish, the, happiness, of, the, party, whose, interest, is, in, question, or, what, is, the, same, thing, in, other, words, to, promote, or, to, oppose, that, happiness, i, say, of, every, action, whatsoever, and, therefore, not, only, of, every, action, of, a, private, individual, but, of, every, measure, of, government, in, chapter, iv, bentham, introduces, a, method, of, calculating, the, value, of, pleasures, and, pains, which, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, hedonic, calculus, bentham, says, that, the, value, of, a, pleasure, or, pain, considered, by, itself, can, be, measured, according, to, its, intensity, duration, certainty, uncertainty, and, propinquity, remoteness, in, addition, it, is, necessary, to, consider, the, tendency, of, any, act, by, which, it, is, produced, and, therefore, to, take, account, of, the, act, s, fecundity, or, the, chance, it, has, of, being, followed, by, sensations, of, the, same, kind, and, its, purity, or, the, chance, it, has, of, not, being, followed, by, sensations, of, the, opposite, kind, finally, it, is, necessary, to, consider, the, extent, or, the, number, of, people, affected, by, the, action, the, question, then, arises, as, to, when, if, at, all, it, might, be, legitimate, to, break, the, law, this, is, considered, in, the, theory, of, legislation, where, bentham, distinguishes, between, evils, of, the, first, and, second, order, those, of, the, first, order, are, the, more, immediate, consequences, those, of, the, second, are, when, the, consequences, spread, through, the, community, causing, alarm, and, danger, it, is, true, there, are, cases, in, which, if, we, confine, ourselves, to, the, effects, of, the, first, order, the, good, will, have, an, incontestable, preponderance, over, the, evil, were, the, offence, considered, only, under, this, point, of, view, it, would, not, be, easy, to, assign, any, good, reasons, to, justify, the, rigour, of, the, laws, every, thing, depends, upon, the, evil, of, the, second, order, it, is, this, which, gives, to, such, actions, the, character, of, crime, and, which, makes, punishment, necessary, let, us, take, for, example, the, physical, desire, of, satisfying, hunger, let, a, beggar, pressed, by, hunger, steal, from, a, rich, man, s, house, a, loaf, which, perhaps, saves, him, from, starving, can, it, be, possible, to, compare, the, good, which, the, thief, acquires, for, himself, with, the, evil, which, the, rich, man, suffers, it, is, not, on, account, of, the, evil, of, the, first, order, that, it, is, necessary, to, erect, these, actions, into, offences, but, on, account, of, the, evil, of, the, second, order, mill, was, brought, up, as, a, benthamite, with, the, explicit, intention, that, he, would, carry, on, the, cause, of, utilitarianism, mill, s, book, utilitarianism, first, appeared, as, a, series, of, three, articles, published, in, fraser, s, magazine, in, 1861, and, was, reprinted, as, a, single, book, in, 1863, mill, rejects, a, purely, quantitative, measurement, of, utility, and, says, it, is, quite, compatible, with, the, principle, of, utility, to, recognize, the, fact, that, some, kinds, of, pleasure, are, more, desirable, and, more, valuable, than, others, it, would, be, absurd, that, while, in, estimating, all, other, things, quality, is, considered, as, well, as, quantity, the, estimation, of, pleasures, should, be, supposed, to, depend, on, quantity, alone, the, word, utility, is, used, to, mean, general, well, being, or, happiness, and, mill, s, view, is, that, utility, is, the, consequence, of, a, good, action, utility, within, the, context, of, utilitarianism, refers, to, people, performing, actions, for, social, utility, with, social, utility, he, means, the, well, being, of, many, people, mill, s, explanation, of, the, concept, of, utility, in, his, work, utilitarianism, is, that, people, really, do, desire, happiness, and, since, each, individual, desires, their, own, happiness, it, must, follow, that, all, of, us, desire, the, happiness, of, everyone, contributing, to, a, larger, social, utility, thus, an, action, that, results, in, the, greatest, pleasure, for, the, utility, of, society, is, the, best, action, or, as, jeremy, bentham, the, founder, of, early, utilitarianism, put, it, as, the, greatest, happiness, of, the, greatest, number, mill, not, only, viewed, actions, as, a, core, part, of, utility, but, as, the, directive, rule, of, moral, human, conduct, the, rule, being, that, we, should, only, be, committing, actions, that, provide, pleasure, to, society, this, view, of, pleasure, was, hedonistic, as, it, pursued, the, thought, that, pleasure, is, the, highest, good, in, life, this, concept, was, adopted, by, bentham, and, can, be, seen, in, his, works, according, to, mill, good, actions, result, in, pleasure, and, that, there, is, no, higher, end, than, pleasure, mill, says, that, good, actions, lead, to, pleasure, and, define, good, character, better, put, the, justification, of, character, and, whether, an, action, is, good, or, not, is, based, on, how, the, person, contributes, to, the, concept, of, social, utility, in, the, long, run, the, best, proof, of, a, good, character, is, good, actions, and, resolutely, refuse, to, consider, any, mental, disposition, as, good, of, which, the, predominant, tendency, is, to, produce, bad, conduct, in, the, last, chapter, of, utilitarianism, mill, concludes, that, justice, as, a, classifying, factor, of, our, actions, being, just, or, unjust, is, one, of, the, certain, moral, requirements, and, when, the, requirements, are, all, regarded, collectively, they, are, viewed, as, greater, according, to, this, scale, of, social, utility, as, mill, puts, it, he, also, notes, that, contrary, to, what, its, critics, might, say, there, is, no, known, epicurean, theory, of, life, which, does, not, assign, to, the, pleasures, of, the, intellect, a, much, higher, value, as, pleasures, than, to, those, of, mere, sensation, however, he, accepts, that, this, is, usually, because, the, intellectual, pleasures, are, thought, to, have, circumstantial, advantages, i, e, greater, permanency, safety, uncostliness, c, instead, mill, will, argue, that, some, pleasures, are, intrinsically, better, than, others, the, accusation, that, hedonism, is, a, doctrine, worthy, only, of, swine, has, a, long, history, in, nicomachean, ethics, book, 1, chapter, 5, aristotle, says, that, identifying, the, good, with, pleasure, is, to, prefer, a, life, suitable, for, beasts, the, theological, utilitarians, had, the, option, of, grounding, their, pursuit, of, happiness, in, the, will, of, god, the, hedonistic, utilitarians, needed, a, different, defence, mill, s, approach, is, to, argue, that, the, pleasures, of, the, intellect, are, intrinsically, superior, to, physical, pleasures, few, human, creatures, would, consent, to, be, changed, into, any, of, the, lower, animals, for, a, promise, of, the, fullest, allowance, of, a, beast, s, pleasures, no, intelligent, human, being, would, consent, to, be, a, fool, no, instructed, person, would, be, an, ignoramus, no, person, of, feeling, and, conscience, would, be, selfish, and, base, even, though, they, should, be, persuaded, that, the, fool, the, dunce, or, the, rascal, is, better, satisfied, with, his, lot, than, they, are, with, theirs, a, being, of, higher, faculties, requires, more, to, make, him, happy, is, capable, probably, of, more, acute, suffering, and, certainly, accessible, to, it, at, more, points, than, one, of, an, inferior, type, but, in, spite, of, these, liabilities, he, can, never, really, wish, to, sink, into, what, he, feels, to, be, a, lower, grade, of, existence, it, is, better, to, be, a, human, being, dissatisfied, than, a, pig, satisfied, better, to, be, socrates, dissatisfied, than, a, fool, satisfied, and, if, the, fool, or, the, pig, are, of, a, different, opinion, it, is, because, they, only, know, their, own, side, of, the, question, mill, argues, that, if, people, who, are, competently, acquainted, with, two, pleasures, show, a, decided, preference, for, one, even, if, it, be, accompanied, by, more, discontent, and, would, not, resign, it, for, any, quantity, of, the, other, then, it, is, legitimate, to, regard, that, pleasure, as, being, superior, in, quality, mill, recognizes, that, these, competent, judges, will, not, always, agree, and, states, that, in, cases, of, disagreement, the, judgment, of, the, majority, is, to, be, accepted, as, final, mill, also, acknowledges, that, many, who, are, capable, of, the, higher, pleasures, occasionally, under, the, influence, of, temptation, postpone, them, to, the, lower, but, this, is, quite, compatible, with, a, full, appreciation, of, the, intrinsic, superiority, of, the, higher, mill, says, that, this, appeal, to, those, who, have, experienced, the, relevant, pleasures, is, no, different, from, what, must, happen, when, assessing, the, quantity, of, pleasure, for, there, is, no, other, way, of, measuring, the, acutest, of, two, pains, or, the, intensest, of, two, pleasurable, sensations, it, is, indisputable, that, the, being, whose, capacities, of, enjoyment, are, low, has, the, greatest, chance, of, having, them, fully, satisfied, and, a, highly, endowed, being, will, always, feel, that, any, happiness, which, he, can, look, for, as, the, world, is, constitute, is, imperfect, mill, also, thinks, that, intellectual, pursuits, have, value, out, of, proportion, to, the, amount, of, contentment, or, pleasure, the, mental, state, that, they, produce, mill, also, says, that, people, should, pursue, these, grand, ideals, because, if, they, choose, to, have, gratification, from, petty, pleasures, some, displeasure, will, eventually, creep, in, we, will, become, bored, and, depressed, mill, claims, that, gratification, from, petty, pleasures, only, gives, short, term, happiness, and, subsequently, worsens, the, individual, who, may, feel, that, his, life, lacks, happiness, since, the, happiness, is, transient, whereas, intellectual, pursuits, give, long, term, happiness, because, they, provide, the, individual, with, constant, opportunities, throughout, the, years, to, improve, his, life, by, benefiting, from, accruing, knowledge, mill, views, intellectual, pursuits, as, capable, of, incorporating, the, finer, things, in, life, while, petty, pursuits, do, not, achieve, this, goal, mill, is, saying, that, intellectual, pursuits, give, the, individual, the, opportunity, to, escape, the, constant, depression, cycle, since, these, pursuits, allow, them, to, achieve, their, ideals, while, petty, pleasures, do, not, offer, this, although, debate, persists, about, the, nature, of, mill, s, view, of, gratification, this, suggests, bifurcation, in, his, position, in, chapter, four, of, utilitarianism, mill, considers, what, proof, can, be, given, for, the, principle, of, utility, the, only, proof, capable, of, being, given, that, an, object, is, visible, is, that, people, actually, see, it, the, only, proof, that, a, sound, is, audible, is, that, people, hear, it, in, like, manner, i, apprehend, the, sole, evidence, it, is, possible, to, produce, that, anything, is, desirable, is, that, people, do, actually, desire, it, no, reason, can, be, given, why, the, general, happiness, is, desirable, except, that, each, person, so, far, as, he, believes, it, to, be, attainable, desires, his, own, happiness, we, have, not, only, all, the, proof, which, the, case, admits, of, but, all, which, it, is, possible, to, require, that, happiness, is, a, good, that, each, person, s, happiness, is, a, good, to, that, person, and, the, general, happiness, therefore, a, good, to, the, aggregate, of, all, persons, it, is, usual, to, say, that, mill, is, committing, a, number, of, fallacies, such, allegations, began, to, emerge, in, mill, s, lifetime, shortly, after, the, publication, of, utilitarianism, and, persisted, for, well, over, a, century, though, the, tide, has, been, turning, in, recent, discussions, nonetheless, a, defence, of, mill, against, all, three, charges, with, a, chapter, devoted, to, each, can, be, found, in, necip, fikri, alican, s, mill, s, principle, of, utility, a, defense, of, john, stuart, mill, s, notorious, proof, 1994, this, is, the, first, and, remains, the, only, book, length, treatment, of, the, subject, matter, yet, the, alleged, fallacies, in, the, proof, continue, to, attract, scholarly, attention, in, journal, articles, and, book, chapters, hall, 1949, and, popkin, 1950, defend, mill, against, this, accusation, pointing, out, that, he, begins, chapter, four, by, asserting, that, questions, of, ultimate, ends, do, not, admit, of, proof, in, the, ordinary, acceptation, of, the, term, and, that, this, is, common, to, all, first, principles, therefore, according, to, hall, and, popkin, mill, does, not, attempt, to, establish, that, what, people, do, desire, is, desirable, but, merely, attempts, to, make, the, principles, acceptable, the, type, of, proof, mill, is, offering, consists, only, of, some, considerations, which, mill, thought, might, induce, an, honest, and, reasonable, man, to, accept, utilitarianism, having, claimed, that, people, do, in, fact, desire, happiness, mill, now, has, to, show, that, it, is, the, only, thing, they, desire, mill, anticipates, the, objection, that, people, desire, other, things, such, as, virtue, he, argues, that, whilst, people, might, start, desiring, virtue, as, a, means, to, happiness, eventually, it, becomes, part, of, someone, s, happiness, and, is, then, desired, as, an, end, in, itself, the, principle, of, utility, does, not, mean, that, any, given, pleasure, as, music, for, instance, or, any, given, exemption, from, pain, as, for, example, health, are, to, be, looked, upon, as, means, to, a, collective, something, termed, happiness, and, to, be, desired, on, that, account, they, are, desired, and, desirable, in, and, for, themselves, besides, being, means, they, are, a, part, of, the, end, virtue, according, to, the, utilitarian, doctrine, is, not, naturally, and, originally, part, of, the, end, but, it, is, capable, of, becoming, so, and, in, those, who, love, it, disinterestedly, it, has, become, so, and, is, desired, and, cherished, not, as, a, means, to, happiness, but, as, a, part, of, their, happiness, we, may, give, what, explanation, we, please, of, this, unwillingness, we, may, attribute, it, to, pride, a, name, which, is, given, indiscriminately, to, some, of, the, most, and, to, some, of, the, least, estimable, feelings, of, which, is, mankind, are, capable, we, may, refer, it, to, the, love, of, liberty, and, personal, independence, an, appeal, to, which, was, with, the, stoics, one, of, the, most, effective, means, for, the, inculcation, of, it, to, the, love, of, power, or, the, love, of, excitement, both, of, which, do, really, enter, into, and, contribute, to, it, but, its, most, appropriate, appellation, is, a, sense, of, dignity, which, all, humans, beings, possess, in, one, form, or, other, and, in, some, though, by, no, means, in, exact, proportion, to, their, higher, faculties, and, which, is, so, essential, a, part, of, the, happiness, of, those, in, whom, it, is, strong, that, nothing, which, conflicts, with, it, could, be, otherwise, than, momentarily, an, object, of, desire, to, them, sidgwick, s, book, the, methods, of, ethics, has, been, referred, to, as, the, peak, or, culmination, of, classical, utilitarianism, his, main, goal, in, this, book, is, to, ground, utilitarianism, in, the, principles, of, common, sense, morality, and, thereby, dispense, with, the, doubts, of, his, predecessors, that, these, two, are, at, odds, with, each, other, for, sidgwick, ethics, is, about, which, actions, are, objectively, right, our, knowledge, of, right, and, wrong, arises, from, common, sense, morality, which, lacks, a, coherent, principle, at, its, core, the, task, of, philosophy, in, general, and, ethics, in, particular, is, not, so, much, to, create, new, knowledge, but, to, systematize, existing, knowledge, sidgwick, tries, to, achieve, this, by, formulating, methods, of, ethics, which, he, defines, as, rational, procedures, for, determining, right, conduct, in, any, particular, case, he, identifies, three, methods, intuitionism, which, involves, various, independently, valid, moral, principles, to, determine, what, ought, to, be, done, and, two, forms, of, hedonism, in, which, rightness, only, depends, on, the, pleasure, and, pain, following, from, the, action, hedonism, is, subdivided, into, egoistic, hedonism, which, only, takes, the, agent, s, own, well, being, into, account, and, universal, hedonism, or, utilitarianism, which, is, concerned, with, everyone, s, well, being, intuitionism, holds, that, we, have, intuitive, i, e, non, inferential, knowledge, of, moral, principles, which, are, self, evident, to, the, knower, the, criteria, for, this, type, of, knowledge, include, that, they, are, expressed, in, clear, terms, that, the, different, principles, are, mutually, consistent, with, each, other, and, that, there, is, expert, consensus, on, them, according, to, sidgwick, commonsense, moral, principles, fail, to, pass, this, test, but, there, are, some, more, abstract, principles, that, pass, it, like, that, what, is, right, for, me, must, be, right, for, all, persons, in, precisely, similar, circumstances, or, that, one, should, be, equally, concerned, with, all, temporal, parts, of, one, s, life, the, most, general, principles, arrived, at, this, way, are, all, compatible, with, utilitarianism, which, is, why, sidgwick, sees, a, harmony, between, intuitionism, and, utilitarianism, there, are, also, less, general, intuitive, principles, like, the, duty, to, keep, one, s, promises, or, to, be, just, but, these, principles, are, not, universal, and, there, are, cases, where, different, duties, stand, in, conflict, with, each, other, sidgwick, suggests, that, we, resolve, such, conflicts, in, a, utilitarian, fashion, by, considering, the, consequences, of, the, conflicting, actions, the, harmony, between, intuitionism, and, utilitarianism, is, a, partial, success, in, sidgwick, s, overall, project, but, he, sees, full, success, impossible, since, egoism, which, he, considers, as, equally, rational, cannot, be, reconciled, with, utilitarianism, unless, religious, assumptions, are, introduced, such, assumptions, for, example, the, existence, of, a, personal, god, who, rewards, and, punishes, the, agent, in, the, afterlife, could, reconcile, egoism, and, utilitarianism, but, without, them, we, have, to, admit, a, dualism, of, practical, reason, that, constitutes, a, fundamental, contradiction, in, our, moral, consciousness, the, description, of, ideal, utilitarianism, was, first, used, by, hastings, rashdall, in, the, theory, of, good, and, evil, 1907, but, it, is, more, often, associated, with, g, e, moore, in, ethics, 1912, moore, rejects, a, purely, hedonistic, utilitarianism, and, argues, that, there, is, a, range, of, values, that, might, be, maximized, moore, s, strategy, was, to, show, that, it, is, intuitively, implausible, that, pleasure, is, the, sole, measure, of, what, is, good, he, says, that, such, an, assumption, involves, our, saying, for, instance, that, a, world, in, which, absolutely, nothing, except, pleasure, existed, no, knowledge, no, love, no, enjoyment, of, beauty, no, moral, qualities, must, yet, be, intrinsically, better, better, worth, creating, provided, only, the, total, quantity, of, pleasure, in, it, were, the, least, bit, greater, than, one, in, which, all, these, things, existed, as, well, as, pleasure, it, involves, our, saying, that, even, if, the, total, quantity, of, pleasure, in, each, was, exactly, equal, yet, the, fact, that, all, the, beings, in, the, one, possessed, in, addition, knowledge, of, many, different, kinds, and, a, full, appreciation, of, all, that, was, beautiful, or, worthy, of, love, in, their, world, whereas, none, of, the, beings, in, the, other, possessed, any, of, these, things, would, give, us, no, reason, whatever, for, preferring, the, former, to, the, latter, moore, admits, that, it, is, impossible, to, prove, the, case, either, way, but, he, believed, that, it, was, intuitively, obvious, that, even, if, the, amount, of, pleasure, stayed, the, same, a, world, that, contained, such, things, as, beauty, and, love, would, be, a, better, world, he, adds, that, if, a, person, was, to, take, the, contrary, view, then, i, think, it, is, self, evident, that, he, would, be, wrong, in, the, mid, 20th, century, a, number, of, philosophers, focused, on, the, place, of, rules, in, utilitarian, thought, it, was, already, considered, necessary, to, use, rules, to, help, choose, the, right, action, because, estimating, the, consequences, every, time, seemed, error, prone, and, unlikely, to, bring, the, best, outcome, paley, had, justified, the, use, of, rules, and, mill, says, it, is, truly, a, whimsical, supposition, that, if, mankind, were, agreed, in, considering, utility, to, be, the, test, of, morality, they, would, remain, without, any, agreement, as, to, what, is, useful, and, would, take, no, measures, for, having, their, notions, on, the, subject, taught, to, the, young, and, enforced, by, law, and, opinion, to, consider, the, rules, of, morality, as, improvable, is, one, thing, to, pass, over, the, intermediate, generalisations, entirely, and, endeavour, to, test, each, individual, action, directly, by, the, first, principle, is, another, the, proposition, that, happiness, is, the, end, and, aim, of, morality, does, not, mean, that, no, road, ought, to, be, laid, down, to, that, goal, nobody, argues, that, the, art, of, navigation, is, not, founded, on, astronomy, because, sailors, cannot, wait, to, calculate, the, nautical, almanack, being, rational, creatures, they, go, to, sea, with, it, ready, calculated, and, all, rational, creatures, go, out, upon, the, sea, of, life, with, their, minds, made, up, on, the, common, questions, of, right, and, wrong, however, rule, utilitarianism, proposes, a, more, central, role, for, rules, that, was, thought, to, rescue, the, theory, from, some, of, its, more, devastating, criticisms, particularly, problems, to, do, with, justice, and, promise, keeping, smart, 1956, and, mccloskey, 1957, initially, use, the, terms, extreme, and, restricted, utilitarianism, but, eventually, settled, on, the, prefixes, act, and, rule, instead, likewise, throughout, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, articles, were, published, both, for, and, against, the, new, form, of, utilitarianism, and, through, this, debate, the, theory, we, now, call, rule, utilitarianism, was, created, in, an, introduction, to, an, anthology, of, these, articles, the, editor, was, able, to, say, the, development, of, this, theory, was, a, dialectical, process, of, formulation, criticism, reply, and, reformulation, the, record, of, this, process, well, illustrates, the, co, operative, development, of, a, philosophical, theory, 1, the, essential, difference, is, in, what, determines, whether, or, not, an, action, is, the, right, action, act, utilitarianism, maintains, that, an, action, is, right, if, it, maximizes, utility, rule, utilitarianism, maintains, that, an, action, is, right, if, it, conforms, to, a, rule, that, maximizes, utility, in, 1956, urmson, 1953, published, an, influential, article, arguing, that, mill, justified, rules, on, utilitarian, principles, from, then, on, articles, have, debated, this, interpretation, of, mill, in, all, probability, it, was, not, a, distinction, that, mill, was, particularly, trying, to, make, and, so, the, evidence, in, his, writing, is, inevitably, mixed, a, collection, of, mill, s, writing, published, in, 1977, includes, a, letter, that, seems, to, tip, the, balance, in, favour, of, the, notion, that, mill, is, best, classified, as, an, act, utilitarian, in, the, letter, mill, says, i, agree, with, you, that, the, right, way, of, testing, actions, by, their, consequences, is, to, test, them, by, the, natural, consequences, of, the, particular, action, and, not, by, those, which, would, follow, if, everyone, did, the, same, but, for, the, most, part, the, consideration, of, what, would, happen, if, everyone, did, the, same, is, the, only, means, we, have, of, discovering, the, tendency, of, the, act, in, the, particular, case, some, school, level, textbooks, and, at, least, one, british, examination, board, make, a, further, distinction, between, strong, and, weak, rule, utilitarianism, however, it, is, not, clear, that, this, distinction, is, made, in, the, academic, literature, it, has, been, argued, that, rule, utilitarianism, collapses, into, act, utilitarianism, because, for, any, given, rule, in, the, case, where, breaking, the, rule, produces, more, utility, the, rule, can, be, refined, by, the, addition, of, a, sub, rule, that, handles, cases, like, the, exception, this, process, holds, for, all, cases, of, exceptions, and, so, the, rules, have, as, many, sub, rules, as, there, are, exceptional, cases, which, in, the, end, makes, an, agent, seek, out, whatever, outcome, produces, the, maximum, utility, in, principles, 1973, r, m, hare, accepts, that, rule, utilitarianism, collapses, into, act, utilitarianism, but, claims, that, this, is, a, result, of, allowing, the, rules, to, be, as, specific, and, un, general, as, we, please, he, argues, that, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, introducing, rule, utilitarianism, was, to, do, justice, to, the, general, rules, that, people, need, for, moral, education, and, character, development, and, he, proposes, that, a, difference, between, act, utilitarianism, and, rule, utilitarianism, can, be, introduced, by, limiting, the, specificity, of, the, rules, i, e, by, increasing, their, generality, 14, this, distinction, between, a, specific, rule, utilitarianism, which, collapses, into, act, utilitarianism, and, general, rule, utilitarianism, forms, the, basis, of, hare, s, two, level, utilitarianism, when, we, are, playing, god, or, the, ideal, observer, we, use, the, specific, form, and, we, will, need, to, do, this, when, we, are, deciding, what, general, principles, to, teach, and, follow, when, we, are, inculcating, or, in, situations, where, the, biases, of, our, human, nature, are, likely, to, prevent, us, doing, the, calculations, properly, then, we, should, use, the, more, general, rule, utilitarianism, hare, argues, that, in, practice, most, of, the, time, we, should, be, following, the, general, principles, 17, one, ought, to, abide, by, the, general, principles, whose, general, inculcation, is, for, the, best, harm, is, more, likely, to, come, in, actual, moral, situations, from, questioning, these, rules, than, from, sticking, to, them, unless, the, situations, are, very, extra, ordinary, the, results, of, sophisticated, felicific, calculations, are, not, likely, human, nature, and, human, ignorance, being, what, they, are, to, lead, to, the, greatest, utility, in, moral, thinking, 1981, hare, illustrated, the, two, extremes, the, archangel, is, the, hypothetical, person, who, has, perfect, knowledge, of, the, situation, and, no, personal, biases, or, weaknesses, and, always, uses, critical, moral, thinking, to, decide, the, right, thing, to, do, in, contrast, the, prole, is, the, hypothetical, person, who, is, completely, incapable, of, critical, thinking, and, uses, nothing, but, intuitive, moral, thinking, and, of, necessity, has, to, follow, the, general, moral, rules, they, have, been, taught, or, learned, through, imitation, it, is, not, that, some, people, are, archangels, and, others, proles, but, rather, that, we, all, share, the, characteristics, of, both, to, limited, and, varying, degrees, and, at, different, times, hare, does, not, specify, when, we, should, think, more, like, an, archangel, and, more, like, a, prole, as, this, will, in, any, case, vary, from, person, to, person, however, the, critical, moral, thinking, underpins, and, informs, the, more, intuitive, moral, thinking, it, is, responsible, for, formulating, and, if, necessary, reformulating, the, general, moral, rules, we, also, switch, to, critical, thinking, when, trying, to, deal, with, unusual, situations, or, in, cases, where, the, intuitive, moral, rules, give, conflicting, advice, preference, utilitarianism, entails, promoting, actions, that, fulfil, the, preferences, of, those, beings, involved, the, concept, of, preference, utilitarianism, was, first, proposed, in, 1977, by, john, harsanyi, in, morality, and, the, theory, of, rational, behaviour, however, the, concept, is, more, commonly, associated, with, r, m, hare, peter, singer, and, richard, brandt, harsanyi, claims, that, his, theory, is, indebted, to, 42, harsanyi, rejects, hedonistic, utilitarianism, as, being, dependent, on, an, outdated, psychology, saying, that, it, is, far, from, obvious, that, everything, we, do, is, motivated, by, a, desire, to, maximize, pleasure, and, minimize, pain, he, also, rejects, ideal, utilitarianism, because, it, is, certainly, not, true, as, an, empirical, observation, that, people, s, only, purpose, in, life, is, to, have, mental, states, of, intrinsic, worth, 54, according, to, harsanyi, preference, utilitarianism, is, the, only, form, of, utilitarianism, consistent, with, the, important, philosophical, principle, of, preference, autonomy, by, this, i, mean, the, principle, that, in, deciding, what, is, good, and, what, is, bad, for, a, given, individual, the, ultimate, criterion, can, only, be, his, own, wants, and, his, own, preferences, 55, harsanyi, adds, two, caveats, firstly, people, sometimes, have, irrational, preferences, to, deal, with, this, harsanyi, distinguishes, between, manifest, preferences, and, true, preferences, the, former, are, those, manifested, by, his, observed, behaviour, including, preferences, possibly, based, on, erroneous, factual, beliefs, or, on, careless, logical, analysis, or, on, strong, emotions, that, at, the, moment, greatly, hinder, rational, choice, whereas, the, latter, are, the, preferences, he, would, have, if, he, had, all, the, relevant, factual, information, always, reasoned, with, the, greatest, possible, care, and, were, in, a, state, of, mind, most, conducive, to, rational, choice, 55, it, is, the, latter, that, preference, utilitarianism, tries, to, satisfy, the, second, caveat, is, that, antisocial, preferences, such, as, sadism, envy, and, resentment, have, to, be, excluded, harsanyi, achieves, this, by, claiming, that, such, preferences, partially, exclude, those, people, from, the, moral, community, utilitarian, ethics, makes, all, of, us, members, of, the, same, moral, community, a, person, displaying, ill, will, toward, others, does, remain, a, member, of, this, community, but, not, with, his, whole, personality, that, part, of, his, personality, that, harbours, these, hostile, antisocial, feelings, must, be, excluded, from, membership, and, has, no, claim, for, a, hearing, when, it, comes, to, defining, our, concept, of, social, utility, 56, in, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, 1945, karl, popper, argues, that, the, principle, maximize, pleasure, should, be, replaced, by, minimize, pain, he, believes, that, it, is, not, only, impossible, but, very, dangerous, to, attempt, to, maximize, the, pleasure, or, the, happiness, of, the, people, since, such, an, attempt, must, lead, to, totalitarianism, he, claims, that, here, is, from, the, ethical, point, of, view, no, symmetry, between, suffering, and, happiness, or, between, pain, and, pleasure, in, my, opinion, human, suffering, makes, a, direct, moral, appeal, namely, the, appeal, for, help, while, there, is, no, similar, call, to, increase, the, happiness, of, a, man, who, is, doing, well, anyway, a, further, criticism, of, the, utilitarian, formula, maximize, pleasure, is, that, it, assumes, a, continuous, pleasure, pain, scale, that, lets, us, treat, degrees, of, pain, as, negative, degrees, of, pleasure, but, from, the, moral, point, of, view, pain, cannot, be, outweighed, by, pleasure, and, especially, not, one, man, s, pain, by, another, man, s, pleasure, instead, of, the, greatest, happiness, for, the, greatest, number, one, should, demand, more, modestly, the, least, amount, of, avoidable, suffering, for, all, the, actual, term, negative, utilitarianism, itself, was, introduced, by, r, n, smart, as, the, title, to, his, 1958, reply, to, popper, in, which, he, argues, that, the, principle, would, entail, seeking, the, quickest, and, least, painful, method, of, killing, the, entirety, of, humanity, in, response, to, smart, s, argument, simon, knutsson, 2019, has, argued, that, classical, utilitarianism, and, similar, consequentialist, views, are, roughly, equally, likely, to, entail, killing, the, entirety, of, humanity, as, they, would, seem, to, imply, that, one, should, kill, existing, beings, and, replace, them, with, happier, beings, if, possible, consequently, knutsson, argues, the, world, destruction, argument, is, not, a, reason, to, reject, negative, utilitarianism, in, favour, of, these, other, forms, of, consequentialism, because, there, are, similar, arguments, against, such, theories, that, are, at, least, as, persuasive, as, the, world, destruction, argument, is, against, negative, utilitarianism, furthermore, knutsson, notes, that, one, could, argue, that, other, forms, of, consequentialism, such, as, classical, utilitarianism, in, some, cases, have, less, plausible, implications, than, negative, utilitarianism, such, as, in, scenarios, where, classical, utilitarianism, implies, it, would, be, right, to, kill, everyone, and, replace, them, in, a, manner, that, creates, more, suffering, but, also, more, well, being, such, that, the, sum, on, the, classical, utilitarian, calculus, is, net, positive, negative, utilitarianism, in, contrast, would, not, allow, such, killing, some, versions, of, negative, utilitarianism, include, some, see, negative, utilitarianism, as, a, branch, within, modern, hedonistic, utilitarianism, which, assigns, a, higher, weight, to, the, avoidance, of, suffering, than, to, the, promotion, of, happiness, the, moral, weight, of, suffering, can, be, increased, by, using, a, compassionate, utilitarian, metric, so, that, the, result, is, the, same, as, in, prioritarianism, motive, utilitarianism, was, first, proposed, by, robert, merrihew, adams, in, 1976, whereas, act, utilitarianism, requires, us, to, choose, our, actions, by, calculating, which, action, will, maximize, utility, and, rule, utilitarianism, requires, us, to, implement, rules, that, will, on, the, whole, maximize, utility, motive, utilitarianism, has, the, utility, calculus, being, used, to, select, motives, and, dispositions, according, to, their, general, felicific, effects, and, those, motives, and, dispositions, then, dictate, our, choices, of, actions, 60, the, arguments, for, moving, to, some, form, of, motive, utilitarianism, at, the, personal, level, can, be, seen, as, mirroring, the, arguments, for, moving, to, some, form, of, rule, utilitarianism, at, the, social, level, 17, adams, 1976, refers, to, sidgwick, s, observation, that, happiness, general, as, well, as, individual, is, likely, to, be, better, attained, if, the, extent, to, which, we, set, ourselves, consciously, to, aim, at, it, be, carefully, restricted, 467, trying, to, apply, the, utility, calculation, on, each, and, every, occasion, is, likely, to, lead, to, a, sub, optimal, outcome, it, is, argued, that, applying, carefully, selected, rules, at, the, social, level, and, encouraging, appropriate, motives, at, the, personal, level, are, likely, to, lead, to, better, overall, outcomes, even, though, on, some, individual, occasions, it, leads, to, the, wrong, action, when, assessed, according, to, act, utilitarian, standards, 471, adams, concludes, that, right, action, by, act, utilitarian, standards, and, right, motivation, by, motive, utilitarian, standards, are, incompatible, in, some, cases, 475, the, necessity, of, this, conclusion, is, rejected, by, fred, feldman, who, argues, that, the, conflict, in, question, results, from, an, inadequate, formulation, of, the, utilitarian, doctrines, motives, play, no, essential, role, in, it, recisely, the, same, sort, of, conflict, arises, even, when, mu, is, left, out, of, consideration, and, au, is, applied, by, itself, instead, feldman, proposes, a, variant, of, act, utilitarianism, that, results, in, there, being, no, conflict, between, it, and, motive, utilitarianism, because, utilitarianism, is, not, a, single, theory, but, rather, a, cluster, of, related, theories, that, have, been, developed, over, two, hundred, years, criticisms, can, be, made, for, different, reasons, and, have, different, targets, a, common, objection, to, utilitarianism, is, the, inability, to, quantify, compare, or, measure, happiness, or, well, being, rachael, briggs, writes, in, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, one, objection, to, this, interpretation, of, utility, is, that, there, may, not, be, a, single, good, or, indeed, any, good, which, rationality, requires, us, to, seek, but, if, we, understand, utility, broadly, enough, to, include, all, potentially, desirable, ends, pleasure, knowledge, friendship, health, and, so, on, it, s, not, clear, that, there, is, a, unique, correct, way, to, make, the, tradeoffs, between, different, goods, so, that, each, outcome, receives, a, utility, there, may, be, no, good, answer, to, the, question, of, whether, the, life, of, an, ascetic, monk, contains, more, or, less, good, than, the, life, of, a, happy, libertine, but, assigning, utilities, to, these, options, forces, us, to, compare, them, utility, understood, this, way, is, a, personal, preference, in, the, absence, of, any, objective, measurement, as, rosen, 2003, has, pointed, out, claiming, that, act, utilitarians, are, not, concerned, about, having, rules, is, to, set, up, a, straw, man, similarly, r, m, hare, refers, to, the, crude, caricature, of, act, utilitarianism, which, is, the, only, version, of, it, that, many, philosophers, seem, to, be, acquainted, with, given, what, bentham, says, about, second, order, evils, it, would, be, a, serious, misrepresentation, to, say, that, he, and, similar, act, utilitarians, would, be, prepared, to, punish, an, innocent, person, for, the, greater, good, nevertheless, whether, they, would, agree, or, not, this, is, what, critics, of, utilitarianism, claim, is, entailed, by, the, theory, a, classic, version, of, this, criticism, was, given, by, h, j, mccloskey, in, his, 1957, sheriff, scenario, suppose, that, a, sheriff, were, faced, with, the, choice, either, of, framing, a, negro, for, a, rape, that, had, aroused, hostility, to, the, negroes, a, particular, negro, generally, being, believed, to, be, guilty, but, whom, the, sheriff, knows, not, to, be, guilty, and, thus, preventing, serious, anti, negro, riots, which, would, probably, lead, to, some, loss, of, life, and, increased, hatred, of, each, other, by, whites, and, negroes, or, of, hunting, for, the, guilty, person, and, thereby, allowing, the, anti, negro, riots, to, occur, while, doing, the, best, he, can, to, combat, them, in, such, a, case, the, sheriff, if, he, were, an, extreme, utilitarian, would, appear, to, be, committed, to, framing, the, negro, by, extreme, utilitarian, mccloskey, is, referring, to, what, later, came, to, be, called, act, utilitarianism, he, suggests, one, response, might, be, that, the, sheriff, would, not, frame, the, innocent, negro, because, of, another, rule, do, not, punish, an, innocent, person, another, response, might, be, that, the, riots, the, sheriff, is, trying, to, avoid, might, have, positive, utility, in, the, long, run, by, drawing, attention, to, questions, of, race, and, resources, to, help, address, tensions, between, the, communities, in, a, later, article, mccloskey, says, surely, the, utilitarian, must, admit, that, whatever, the, facts, of, the, matter, may, be, it, is, logically, possible, that, an, unjust, system, of, punishment, e, g, a, system, involving, collective, punishments, retroactive, laws, and, punishments, or, punishments, of, parents, and, relations, of, the, offender, may, be, more, useful, than, a, just, system, of, punishment, an, older, form, of, this, argument, was, presented, by, fyodor, dostoyevsky, in, his, book, the, brothers, karamazov, in, which, ivan, challenges, his, brother, alyosha, to, answer, his, question, tell, me, straight, out, i, call, on, you, answer, me, imagine, that, you, yourself, are, building, the, edifice, of, human, destiny, with, the, object, of, making, people, happy, in, the, finale, of, giving, them, peace, and, rest, at, last, but, for, that, you, must, inevitably, and, unavoidably, torture, just, one, tiny, creature, and, raise, your, edifice, on, the, foundation, of, her, unrequited, tears, would, you, agree, to, be, the, architect, on, such, conditions, and, can, you, admit, the, idea, that, the, people, for, whom, you, are, building, would, agree, to, accept, their, happiness, on, the, unjustified, blood, of, a, tortured, child, and, having, accepted, it, to, remain, forever, happy, this, scenario, was, illustrated, in, more, depth, in, 1973, by, ursula, k, le, guin, in, the, celebrated, short, story, the, ones, who, walk, away, from, omelas, some, argue, that, it, is, impossible, to, do, the, calculation, that, utilitarianism, requires, because, consequences, are, inherently, unknowable, daniel, dennett, describes, this, as, the, three, mile, island, effect, dennett, points, out, that, not, only, is, it, impossible, to, assign, a, precise, utility, value, to, the, incident, it, is, impossible, to, know, whether, ultimately, the, near, meltdown, that, occurred, was, a, good, or, bad, thing, he, suggests, that, it, would, have, been, a, good, thing, if, plant, operators, learned, lessons, that, prevented, future, serious, incidents, russell, hardin, 1990, rejects, such, arguments, he, argues, that, it, is, possible, to, distinguish, the, moral, impulse, of, utilitarianism, which, is, to, define, the, right, as, good, consequences, and, to, motivate, people, to, achieve, these, from, our, ability, to, correctly, apply, rational, principles, that, among, other, things, depend, on, the, perceived, facts, of, the, case, and, on, the, particular, moral, actor, s, mental, equipment, the, fact, that, the, latter, is, limited, and, can, change, does, not, mean, that, the, former, has, to, be, rejected, if, we, develop, a, better, system, for, determining, relevant, causal, relations, so, that, we, are, able, to, choose, actions, that, better, produce, our, intended, ends, it, does, not, follow, that, we, then, must, change, our, ethics, the, moral, impulse, of, utilitarianism, is, constant, but, our, decisions, under, it, are, contingent, on, our, knowledge, and, scientific, understanding, from, the, beginning, utilitarianism, has, recognized, that, certainty, in, such, matters, is, unobtainable, and, both, bentham, and, mill, said, that, it, was, necessary, to, rely, on, the, tendencies, of, actions, to, bring, about, consequences, g, e, moore, writing, in, 1903, said, we, certainly, cannot, hope, directly, to, compare, their, effects, except, within, a, limited, future, and, all, the, arguments, which, have, ever, been, used, in, ethics, and, upon, which, we, commonly, act, in, common, life, directed, to, shewing, that, one, course, is, superior, to, another, are, apart, from, theological, dogmas, confined, to, pointing, out, such, probable, immediate, advantages, an, ethical, law, has, the, nature, not, of, a, scientific, law, but, of, a, scientific, prediction, and, the, latter, is, always, merely, probable, although, the, probability, may, be, very, great, act, utilitarianism, not, only, requires, everyone, to, do, what, they, can, to, maximize, utility, but, to, do, so, without, any, favouritism, mill, said, as, between, his, own, happiness, and, that, of, others, utilitarianism, requires, him, to, be, as, strictly, impartial, as, a, disinterested, and, benevolent, spectator, critics, say, that, this, combination, of, requirements, leads, to, utilitarianism, making, unreasonable, demands, the, well, being, of, strangers, counts, just, as, much, as, that, of, friends, family, or, self, what, makes, this, requirement, so, demanding, is, the, gargantuan, number, of, strangers, in, great, need, of, help, and, the, indefinitely, many, opportunities, to, make, sacrifices, to, help, them, as, shelly, kagan, says, given, the, parameters, of, the, actual, world, there, is, no, question, that, maximally, promoting, the, good, would, require, a, life, of, hardship, self, denial, and, austerity, a, life, spent, promoting, the, good, would, be, a, severe, one, indeed, hooker, 2002, describes, two, aspects, to, the, problem, act, utilitarianism, requires, huge, sacrifices, from, those, who, are, relatively, better, off, and, also, requires, sacrifice, of, your, own, good, even, when, the, aggregate, good, will, be, only, slightly, increased, another, way, of, highlighting, the, complaint, is, to, say, that, in, utilitarianism, there, is, no, such, thing, as, morally, permissible, self, sacrifice, that, goes, above, and, beyond, the, call, of, duty, mill, was, quite, clear, about, this, a, sacrifice, which, does, not, increase, or, tend, to, increase, the, sum, total, of, happiness, it, considers, as, wasted, one, response, to, the, problem, is, to, accept, its, demands, this, is, the, view, taken, by, peter, singer, who, says, no, doubt, we, do, instinctively, prefer, to, help, those, who, are, close, to, us, few, could, stand, by, and, watch, a, child, drown, many, can, ignore, the, avoidable, deaths, of, children, in, africa, or, india, the, question, however, is, not, what, we, usually, do, but, what, we, ought, to, do, and, it, is, difficult, to, see, any, sound, moral, justification, for, the, view, that, distance, or, community, membership, makes, a, crucial, difference, to, our, obligations, others, argue, that, a, moral, theory, that, is, so, contrary, to, our, deeply, held, moral, convictions, must, either, be, rejected, or, modified, there, have, been, various, attempts, to, modify, utilitarianism, to, escape, its, seemingly, over, demanding, requirements, one, approach, is, to, drop, the, demand, that, utility, be, maximized, in, satisficing, consequentialism, michael, slote, argues, for, a, form, of, utilitarianism, where, an, act, might, qualify, as, morally, right, through, having, good, enough, consequences, even, though, better, consequences, could, have, been, produced, one, advantage, of, such, a, system, is, that, it, would, be, able, to, accommodate, the, notion, of, supererogatory, actions, samuel, scheffler, takes, a, different, approach, and, amends, the, requirement, that, everyone, be, treated, the, same, in, particular, scheffler, suggests, that, there, is, an, agent, centered, prerogative, such, that, when, the, overall, utility, is, being, calculated, it, is, permitted, to, count, our, own, interests, more, heavily, than, the, interests, of, others, kagan, suggests, that, such, a, procedure, might, be, justified, on, the, grounds, that, a, general, requirement, to, promote, the, good, would, lack, the, motivational, underpinning, necessary, for, genuine, moral, requirements, and, secondly, that, personal, independence, is, necessary, for, the, existence, of, commitments, and, close, personal, relations, and, that, the, value, of, such, commitments, yields, a, positive, reason, for, preserving, within, moral, theory, at, least, some, moral, independence, for, the, personal, point, of, view, robert, goodin, takes, yet, another, approach, and, argues, that, the, demandingness, objection, can, be, blunted, by, treating, utilitarianism, as, a, guide, to, public, policy, rather, than, one, of, individual, morality, he, suggests, that, many, of, the, problems, arise, under, the, traditional, formulation, because, the, conscientious, utilitarian, ends, up, having, to, make, up, for, the, failings, of, others, and, so, contributing, more, than, their, fair, share, gandjour, specifically, considers, market, situations, and, analyses, whether, individuals, who, act, in, markets, may, produce, a, utilitarian, optimum, he, lists, several, demanding, conditions, that, need, to, be, satisfied, individuals, need, to, display, instrumental, rationality, markets, need, to, be, perfectly, competitive, and, income, and, goods, need, to, be, redistributed, harsanyi, argues, that, the, objection, overlooks, the, fact, that, people, attach, considerable, utility, to, freedom, from, unduly, burdensome, moral, obligations, most, people, will, prefer, a, society, with, a, more, relaxed, moral, code, and, will, feel, that, such, a, society, will, achieve, a, higher, level, of, average, utility, even, if, adoption, of, such, a, moral, code, should, lead, to, some, losses, in, economic, and, cultural, accomplishments, so, long, as, these, losses, remain, within, tolerable, limits, this, means, that, utilitarianism, if, correctly, interpreted, will, yield, a, moral, code, with, a, standard, of, acceptable, conduct, very, much, below, the, level, of, highest, moral, perfection, leaving, plenty, of, scope, for, supererogatory, actions, exceeding, this, minimum, standard, the, objection, that, utilitarianism, does, not, take, seriously, the, distinction, between, persons, came, to, prominence, in, 1971, with, the, publication, of, john, rawls, a, theory, of, justice, the, concept, is, also, important, in, animal, rights, advocate, richard, ryder, s, rejection, of, utilitarianism, in, which, he, talks, of, the, boundary, of, the, individual, through, which, neither, pain, nor, pleasure, may, pass, however, a, similar, objection, was, noted, in, 1970, by, thomas, nagel, who, claimed, that, consequentialism, treats, the, desires, needs, satisfactions, and, dissatisfactions, of, distinct, persons, as, if, they, were, the, desires, etc, of, a, mass, person, and, even, earlier, by, david, gauthier, who, wrote, that, utilitarianism, supposes, that, mankind, is, a, super, person, whose, greatest, satisfaction, is, the, objective, of, moral, action, but, this, is, absurd, individuals, have, wants, not, mankind, individuals, seek, satisfaction, not, mankind, a, person, s, satisfaction, is, not, part, of, any, greater, satisfaction, thus, the, aggregation, of, utility, becomes, futile, as, both, pain, and, happiness, are, intrinsic, to, and, inseparable, from, the, consciousness, in, which, they, are, felt, rendering, impossible, the, task, of, adding, up, the, various, pleasures, of, multiple, individuals, a, response, to, this, criticism, is, to, point, out, that, whilst, seeming, to, resolve, some, problems, it, introduces, others, intuitively, there, are, many, cases, where, people, do, want, to, take, the, numbers, involved, into, account, as, alastair, norcross, has, said, uppose, that, homer, is, faced, with, the, painful, choice, between, saving, barney, from, a, burning, building, or, saving, both, moe, and, apu, from, the, building, it, is, clearly, better, for, homer, to, save, the, larger, number, precisely, because, it, is, a, larger, number, can, anyone, who, really, considers, the, matter, seriously, honestly, claim, to, believe, that, it, is, worse, that, one, person, die, than, that, the, entire, sentient, population, of, the, universe, be, severely, mutilated, clearly, not, it, may, be, possible, to, uphold, the, distinction, between, persons, whilst, still, aggregating, utility, if, it, accepted, that, people, can, be, influenced, by, empathy, this, position, is, advocated, by, iain, king, who, has, suggested, the, evolutionary, basis, of, empathy, means, humans, can, take, into, account, the, interests, of, other, individuals, but, only, on, a, one, to, one, basis, since, we, can, only, imagine, ourselves, in, the, mind, of, one, other, person, at, a, time, king, uses, this, insight, to, adapt, utilitarianism, and, it, may, help, reconcile, bentham, s, philosophy, with, deontology, and, virtue, ethics, philosopher, john, taurek, also, argued, that, the, idea, of, adding, happiness, or, pleasures, across, persons, is, quite, unintelligible, and, that, the, numbers, of, persons, involved, in, a, situation, are, morally, irrelevant, taurek, s, basic, concern, comes, down, to, this, we, cannot, explain, what, it, means, to, say, that, things, would, be, five, times, worse, if, five, people, die, than, if, one, person, dies, i, cannot, give, a, satisfactory, account, of, the, meaning, of, judgments, of, this, kind, he, wrote, p, 304, he, argues, that, each, person, can, only, lose, one, person, s, happiness, or, pleasures, there, is, not, five, times, more, loss, of, happiness, or, pleasure, when, five, die, who, would, be, feeling, this, happiness, or, pleasure, each, person, s, potential, loss, has, the, same, significance, to, me, only, as, a, loss, to, that, person, alone, because, by, hypothesis, i, have, an, equal, concern, for, each, person, involved, i, am, moved, to, give, each, of, them, an, equal, chance, to, be, spared, his, loss, p, 307, derek, parfit, 1978, and, others, have, criticized, taurek, s, line, and, it, continues, to, be, discussed, an, early, criticism, which, was, addressed, by, mill, is, that, if, time, is, taken, to, calculate, the, best, course, of, action, it, is, likely, that, the, opportunity, to, take, the, best, course, of, action, will, already, have, passed, mill, responded, that, there, had, been, ample, time, to, calculate, the, likely, effects, amely, the, whole, past, duration, of, the, human, species, during, all, that, time, mankind, have, been, learning, by, experience, the, tendencies, of, actions, on, which, experience, all, the, prudence, as, well, as, all, the, morality, of, life, are, dependent, it, is, a, strange, notion, that, the, acknowledgment, of, a, first, principle, is, inconsistent, with, the, admission, of, secondary, ones, to, inform, a, traveller, respecting, the, place, of, his, ultimate, destination, is, not, to, forbid, the, use, of, landmarks, and, direction, posts, on, the, way, the, proposition, that, happiness, is, the, end, and, aim, of, morality, does, not, mean, that, no, road, ought, to, be, laid, down, to, that, goal, or, that, persons, going, thither, should, not, be, advised, to, take, one, direction, rather, than, another, men, really, ought, to, leave, off, talking, a, kind, of, nonsense, on, this, subject, which, they, would, neither, talk, nor, listen, to, on, other, matters, of, practical, concernment, more, recently, hardin, has, made, the, same, point, it, should, embarrass, philosophers, that, they, have, ever, taken, this, objection, seriously, parallel, considerations, in, other, realms, are, dismissed, with, eminently, good, sense, lord, devlin, notes, if, the, reasonable, man, worked, to, rule, by, perusing, to, the, point, of, comprehension, every, form, he, was, handed, the, commercial, and, administrative, life, of, the, country, would, creep, to, a, standstill, it, is, such, considerations, that, lead, even, act, utilitarians, to, rely, on, rules, of, thumb, as, smart, 1973, has, called, them, one, of, the, oldest, criticisms, of, utilitarianism, is, that, it, ignores, our, special, obligations, for, example, if, we, were, given, the, choice, between, saving, two, random, people, or, our, mother, most, would, choose, to, save, their, mothers, according, to, utilitarianism, such, a, natural, action, is, immoral, the, first, to, respond, to, this, was, an, early, utilitarian, and, friend, of, jeremy, bentham, named, william, godwin, who, held, in, his, work, enquiry, concerning, political, justice, that, such, personal, needs, should, be, disregarded, in, favour, of, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, of, people, applying, the, utilitarian, principle, that, life, ought, to, be, preferred, which, will, be, most, conducive, to, the, general, good, to, the, choice, of, saving, one, of, two, people, either, the, illustrious, archbishop, of, cambray, or, his, chambermaid, he, wrote, supposing, the, chambermaid, had, been, my, wife, my, mother, or, my, benefactor, that, would, not, alter, the, truth, of, the, proposition, the, life, of, would, still, be, more, valuable, than, that, of, the, chambermaid, and, justice, pure, unadulterated, justice, would, still, have, preferred, that, which, was, most, valuable, utilitarianism, s, assertion, that, well, being, is, the, only, thing, with, intrinsic, moral, value, has, been, attacked, by, various, critics, thomas, carlyle, derided, benthamee, utility, virtue, by, profit, and, loss, reducing, this, god, s, world, to, a, dead, brute, steam, engine, the, infinite, celestial, soul, of, man, to, a, kind, of, hay, balance, for, weighing, hay, and, thistles, on, pleasures, and, pains, on, karl, marx, in, das, kapital, criticises, bentham, s, utilitarianism, on, the, grounds, that, it, does, not, appear, to, recognise, that, people, have, different, joys, in, different, socioeconomic, contexts, with, the, driest, naivete, he, takes, the, modern, shopkeeper, especially, the, english, shopkeeper, as, the, normal, man, whatever, is, useful, to, this, queer, normal, man, and, to, his, world, is, absolutely, useful, this, yard, measure, then, he, applies, to, past, present, and, future, the, christian, religion, e, g, is, useful, because, it, forbids, in, the, name, of, religion, the, same, faults, that, the, penal, code, condemns, in, the, name, of, the, law, artistic, criticism, is, harmful, because, it, disturbs, worthy, people, in, their, enjoyment, of, martin, tupper, etc, with, such, rubbish, has, the, brave, fellow, with, his, motto, nulla, dies, sine, linea, piled, up, mountains, of, books, pope, john, paul, ii, following, his, personalist, philosophy, argued, that, a, danger, of, utilitarianism, is, that, it, tends, to, make, persons, just, as, much, as, things, the, object, of, use, utilitarianism, he, wrote, is, a, civilization, of, production, and, of, use, a, civilization, of, things, and, not, of, persons, a, civilization, in, which, persons, are, used, in, the, same, way, as, things, are, used, w, d, ross, speaking, from, the, perspective, of, his, deontological, pluralism, acknowledges, that, there, is, a, duty, to, promote, the, maximum, of, aggregate, good, as, utilitarianism, demands, but, ross, contends, this, is, just, one, besides, various, other, duties, like, the, duty, to, keep, one, s, promises, or, to, make, amends, for, wrongful, acts, which, are, ignored, by, the, simplistic, and, reductive, utilitarian, outlook, 19, roger, scruton, was, a, deontologist, and, believed, that, utilitarianism, did, not, give, duty, the, place, that, it, needed, inside, our, ethical, judgements, he, asked, us, to, consider, the, dilemma, of, anna, karenina, who, had, to, choose, between, her, love, of, vronsky, and, her, duty, towards, her, husband, and, her, son, scruton, wrote, suppose, anna, were, to, reason, that, it, is, better, to, satisfy, two, healthy, young, people, and, frustrate, one, old, one, than, to, satisfy, one, old, person, and, frustrate, two, young, ones, by, a, factor, of, 2, 5, to, 1, ergo, i, am, leaving, what, would, we, think, then, of, her, moral, seriousness, in, innocence, and, consequentialism, 1996, jacqueline, laing, a, critic, of, utilitarianism, argues, that, utilitarianism, has, insufficient, conceptual, apparatus, to, comprehend, the, very, idea, of, innocence, a, feature, central, to, any, comprehensive, ethical, theory, in, particular, peter, singer, on, her, view, cannot, without, contradicting, himself, reject, baby, farming, a, thought, experiment, that, involves, mass, producing, deliberately, brain, damaged, children, for, live, birth, for, the, greater, good, of, organ, harvesting, and, at, the, same, time, hold, on, to, his, personism, a, term, coined, by, jenny, teichman, to, describe, his, fluctuating, and, laing, says, irrational, and, discriminatory, theory, of, human, moral, value, his, explanation, that, baby, farming, undermines, attitudes, of, care, and, concern, for, the, very, young, can, be, applied, to, babies, and, the, unborn, both, non, persons, who, may, be, killed, on, his, view, and, contradicts, positions, that, he, adopts, elsewhere, in, his, work, in, the, methods, of, ethics, henry, sidgwick, asked, is, it, total, or, average, happiness, that, we, seek, to, make, a, maximum, paley, notes, that, although, he, speaks, of, the, happiness, of, communities, the, happiness, of, a, people, is, made, up, of, the, happiness, of, single, persons, and, the, quantity, of, happiness, can, only, be, augmented, by, increasing, the, number, of, the, percipients, or, the, pleasure, of, their, perceptions, and, that, if, extreme, cases, such, as, people, held, as, slaves, are, excluded, the, amount, of, happiness, will, usually, be, in, proportion, to, the, number, of, people, consequently, the, decay, of, population, is, the, greatest, evil, that, a, state, can, suffer, and, the, improvement, of, it, the, object, which, ought, in, all, countries, to, be, aimed, at, in, preference, to, every, other, political, purpose, whatsoever, a, similar, view, was, expressed, by, smart, who, argued, that, all, other, things, being, equal, a, universe, with, two, million, happy, people, is, better, than, a, universe, with, only, one, million, happy, people, since, sidgwick, raised, the, question, it, has, been, studied, in, detail, and, philosophers, have, argued, that, using, either, total, or, average, happiness, can, lead, to, objectionable, results, according, to, derek, parfit, using, total, happiness, falls, victim, to, the, repugnant, conclusion, whereby, large, numbers, of, people, with, very, low, but, non, negative, utility, values, can, be, seen, as, a, better, goal, than, a, population, of, a, less, extreme, size, living, in, comfort, in, other, words, according, to, the, theory, it, is, a, moral, good, to, breed, more, people, on, the, world, for, as, long, as, total, happiness, rises, on, the, other, hand, measuring, the, utility, of, a, population, based, on, the, average, utility, of, that, population, avoids, parfit, s, repugnant, conclusion, but, causes, other, problems, for, example, bringing, a, moderately, happy, person, into, a, very, happy, world, would, be, seen, as, an, immoral, act, aside, from, this, the, theory, implies, that, it, would, be, a, moral, good, to, eliminate, all, people, whose, happiness, is, below, average, as, this, would, raise, the, average, happiness, william, shaw, suggests, that, the, problem, can, be, avoided, if, a, distinction, is, made, between, potential, people, who, need, not, concern, us, and, actual, future, people, who, should, concern, us, he, says, utilitarianism, values, the, happiness, of, people, not, the, production, of, units, of, happiness, accordingly, one, has, no, positive, obligation, to, have, children, however, if, you, have, decided, to, have, a, child, then, you, have, an, obligation, to, give, birth, to, the, happiest, child, you, can, utilitarianism, is, typically, taken, to, assess, the, rightness, or, wrongness, of, an, action, by, considering, just, the, consequences, of, that, action, bentham, very, carefully, distinguishes, motive, from, intention, and, says, that, motives, are, not, in, themselves, good, or, bad, but, can, be, referred, to, as, such, on, account, of, their, tendency, to, produce, pleasure, or, pain, he, adds, that, from, every, kind, of, motive, may, proceed, actions, that, are, good, others, that, are, bad, and, others, that, are, indifferent, mill, makes, a, similar, point, and, explicitly, says, that, motive, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, morality, of, the, action, though, much, with, the, worth, of, the, agent, he, who, saves, a, fellow, creature, from, drowning, does, what, is, morally, right, whether, his, motive, be, duty, or, the, hope, of, being, paid, for, his, trouble, however, with, intention, the, situation, is, more, complex, in, a, footnote, printed, in, the, second, edition, of, utilitarianism, mill, says, the, morality, of, the, action, depends, entirely, upon, the, intention, that, is, upon, what, the, agent, wills, to, do, elsewhere, he, says, intention, and, motive, are, two, very, different, things, but, it, is, the, intention, that, is, the, foresight, of, consequences, which, constitutes, the, moral, rightness, or, wrongness, of, the, act, the, correct, interpretation, of, mill, s, footnote, is, a, matter, of, some, debate, the, difficulty, in, interpretation, centres, around, trying, to, explain, why, since, it, is, consequences, that, matter, intentions, should, play, a, role, in, the, assessment, of, the, morality, of, an, action, but, motives, should, not, one, possibility, involves, supposing, that, the, morality, of, the, act, is, one, thing, probably, to, do, with, the, praiseworthiness, or, blameworthiness, of, the, agent, and, its, rightness, or, wrongness, another, jonathan, dancy, rejects, this, interpretation, on, the, grounds, that, mill, is, explicitly, making, intention, relevant, to, an, assessment, of, the, act, not, to, an, assessment, of, the, agent, an, interpretation, given, by, roger, crisp, draws, on, a, definition, given, by, mill, in, a, system, of, logic, where, he, says, that, an, intention, to, produce, the, effect, is, one, thing, the, effect, produced, in, consequence, of, the, intention, is, another, thing, the, two, together, constitute, the, action, accordingly, whilst, two, actions, may, outwardly, appear, to, be, the, same, they, will, be, different, actions, if, there, is, a, different, intention, dancy, notes, that, this, does, not, explain, why, intentions, count, but, motives, do, not, a, third, interpretation, is, that, an, action, might, be, considered, a, complex, action, consisting, of, several, stages, and, it, is, the, intention, that, determines, which, of, these, stages, are, to, be, considered, part, of, the, action, although, this, is, the, interpretation, favoured, by, dancy, he, recognizes, that, this, might, not, have, been, mill, s, own, view, for, mill, would, not, even, allow, that, p, q, expresses, a, complex, proposition, he, wrote, in, his, system, of, logic, i, iv, 3, of, caesar, is, dead, and, brutus, is, alive, that, we, might, as, well, call, a, street, a, complex, house, as, these, two, propositions, a, complex, proposition, finally, whilst, motives, may, not, play, a, role, in, determining, the, morality, of, an, action, this, does, not, preclude, utilitarians, from, fostering, particular, motives, if, doing, so, will, increase, overall, happiness, in, an, introduction, to, the, principles, of, morals, and, legislation, bentham, wrote, the, question, is, not, can, they, reason, nor, can, they, talk, but, can, they, suffer, mill, s, distinction, between, higher, and, lower, pleasures, might, suggest, that, he, gave, more, status, to, humans, however, in, his, essay, whewell, on, moral, philosophy, mill, defends, bentham, s, position, calling, it, a, noble, anticipation, and, writing, granted, that, any, practice, causes, more, pain, to, animals, than, it, gives, pleasure, to, man, is, that, practice, moral, or, immoral, and, if, exactly, in, proportion, as, human, beings, raise, their, heads, out, of, the, slough, of, selfishness, they, do, not, with, one, voice, answer, immoral, let, the, morality, of, the, principle, of, utility, be, for, ever, condemned, henry, sidgwick, also, considers, the, implications, of, utilitarianism, for, nonhuman, animals, he, writes, we, have, next, to, consider, who, the, all, are, whose, happiness, is, to, be, taken, into, account, are, we, to, extend, our, concern, to, all, the, beings, capable, of, pleasure, and, pain, whose, feelings, are, affected, by, our, conduct, or, are, we, to, confine, our, view, to, human, happiness, the, former, view, is, the, one, adopted, by, bentham, and, mill, and, i, believe, by, the, utilitarian, school, generally, and, is, obviously, most, in, accordance, with, the, universality, that, is, characteristic, of, their, principle, it, seems, arbitrary, and, unreasonable, to, exclude, from, the, end, as, so, conceived, any, pleasure, of, any, sentient, being, among, contemporary, utilitarian, philosophers, peter, singer, is, especially, known, for, arguing, that, the, well, being, of, all, sentient, beings, ought, to, be, given, equal, consideration, singer, suggests, that, rights, are, conferred, according, to, the, level, of, a, creature, s, self, awareness, regardless, of, their, species, he, adds, that, humans, tend, to, be, speciesist, discriminatory, against, non, humans, in, ethical, matters, and, argues, that, in, utilitarianism, speciesism, cannot, be, justified, as, there, is, no, rational, distinction, that, can, be, made, between, the, suffering, of, humans, and, the, suffering, of, nonhuman, animals, all, suffering, ought, to, be, reduced, singer, writes, the, racist, violates, the, principle, of, equality, by, giving, greater, weight, to, the, interests, of, members, of, his, own, race, when, there, is, a, clash, between, their, interests, and, the, interests, of, those, of, another, race, similarly, the, speciesist, allows, the, interests, of, his, own, species, to, override, the, greater, interests, of, members, of, other, species, the, pattern, is, the, same, in, each, case, most, human, beings, are, speciesists, in, his, 1990, edition, of, animal, liberation, peter, singer, said, that, he, no, longer, ate, oysters, and, mussels, because, although, the, creatures, might, not, suffer, there, was, a, possibility, they, may, and, it, was, easy, to, avoid, eating, them, in, any, case, this, view, still, might, be, contrasted, with, deep, ecology, which, holds, that, an, intrinsic, value, is, attached, to, all, forms, of, life, and, nature, whether, currently, assumed, to, be, sentient, or, not, according, to, utilitarianism, the, forms, of, life, that, are, unable, to, experience, anything, akin, to, either, enjoyment, or, discomfort, are, denied, moral, status, because, it, is, impossible, to, increase, the, happiness, or, reduce, the, suffering, of, something, that, cannot, feel, happiness, or, suffer, singer, writes, the, capacity, for, suffering, and, enjoying, things, is, a, prerequisite, for, having, interests, at, all, a, condition, that, must, be, satisfied, before, we, can, speak, of, interests, in, any, meaningful, way, it, would, be, nonsense, to, say, that, it, was, not, in, the, interests, of, a, stone, to, be, kicked, along, the, road, by, a, schoolboy, a, stone, does, not, have, interests, because, it, cannot, suffer, nothing, that, we, can, do, to, it, could, possibly, make, any, difference, to, its, welfare, a, mouse, on, the, other, hand, does, have, an, interest, in, not, being, tormented, because, it, will, suffer, if, it, is, if, a, being, suffers, there, can, be, no, moral, justification, for, refusing, to, take, that, suffering, into, consideration, no, matter, what, the, nature, of, the, being, the, principle, of, equality, requires, that, its, suffering, be, counted, equally, with, the, like, suffering, in, so, far, as, rough, comparisons, can, be, made, of, any, other, being, if, a, being, is, not, capable, of, suffering, or, of, experiencing, enjoyment, or, happiness, there, is, nothing, to, be, taken, into, account, thus, the, moral, value, of, one, celled, organisms, as, well, as, some, multi, cellular, organisms, and, natural, entities, like, a, river, is, only, in, the, benefit, they, provide, to, sentient, beings, similarly, utilitarianism, places, no, direct, intrinsic, value, on, biodiversity, although, the, benefits, that, biodiversity, brings, to, sentient, beings, may, mean, that, in, utilitarianism, biodiversity, ought, to, be, maintained, in, general, in, john, stuart, mill, s, essay, on, nature, he, argues, that, the, welfare, of, wild, animals, is, to, be, considered, when, making, utilitarian, judgments, tyler, cowen, argues, that, if, individual, animals, are, carriers, of, utility, then, we, should, consider, limiting, the, predatory, activity, of, carnivores, relative, to, their, victims, at, the, very, least, we, should, limit, current, subsidies, to, nature, s, carnivores, nick, bostrom, and, carl, shulman, consider, that, as, advancements, in, artificial, intelligence, continue, it, will, probably, be, possible, to, engineer, digital, minds, that, require, less, resources, and, have, a, much, higher, rate, and, intensity, of, subjective, experience, than, humans, these, super, beneficiaries, could, also, be, unaffected, by, hedonic, adaptation, nick, bostrom, said, that, we, should, find, paths, that, will, enable, digital, minds, and, biological, minds, to, coexist, in, a, mutually, beneficial, way, where, all, of, these, different, forms, can, flourish, and, thrive, the, concept, has, been, applied, towards, social, welfare, economics, questions, of, justice, the, crisis, of, global, poverty, the, ethics, of, raising, animals, for, food, and, the, importance, of, avoiding, existential, risks, to, humanity, in, the, context, of, lying, some, utilitarians, support, white, lies, an, article, in, the, american, economic, journal, has, addressed, the, issue, of, utilitarian, ethics, within, redistribution, of, wealth, the, journal, stated, that, taxation, of, the, wealthy, is, the, best, way, to, make, use, of, the, disposable, income, they, receive, this, says, that, the, money, creates, utility, for, the, most, people, by, funding, government, services, many, utilitarian, philosophers, including, peter, singer, and, toby, ord, argue, that, inhabitants, of, developed, countries, in, particular, have, an, obligation, to, help, to, end, extreme, poverty, across, the, world, for, example, by, regularly, donating, some, of, their, income, to, charity, peter, singer, for, example, argues, that, donating, some, of, one, s, income, to, charity, could, help, to, save, a, life, or, cure, somebody, from, a, poverty, related, illness, which, is, a, much, better, use, of, the, money, as, it, brings, someone, in, extreme, poverty, far, more, happiness, than, it, would, bring, to, oneself, if, one, lived, in, relative, comfort, however, singer, not, only, argues, that, one, ought, to, donate, a, significant, proportion, of, one, s, income, to, charity, but, also, that, this, money, should, be, directed, to, the, most, cost, effective, charities, in, order, to, bring, about, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, consistent, with, utilitarian, thinking, singer, s, ideas, have, formed, the, basis, of, the, modern, effective, altruism, movement, in, social, choice, and, operations, research, the, utilitarian, rule, also, called, the, max, sum, rule, is, a, rule, saying, that, among, all, possible, alternatives, society, should, pick, the, alternative, which, maximizes, the, sum, of, the, utilities, of, all, individuals, in, society, sub, 2, 5, it, is, a, formal, mathematical, representation, of, the, utilitarian, philosophy, and, is, often, justified, by, reference, to, harsanyi, s, utilitarian, theorem, or, the, von, neumann, morgenstern, theorem, according, to, the, utilitarian, justice, is, the, maximization, of, the, total, or, average, welfare, across, all, relevant, individuals, utilitarianism, fights, crime, in, three, ways
