purgatory, latin, purgatorium, borrowed, into, english, via, anglo, norman, and, old, french, is, a, passing, intermediate, state, after, physical, death, for, purifying, or, purging, a, soul, a, common, analogy, is, dross, being, removed, from, metal, in, a, furnace, in, catholic, doctrine, purgatory, refers, to, the, final, cleansing, of, those, who, died, in, the, state, of, grace, and, leaves, in, them, only, the, holiness, necessary, to, enter, the, joy, of, heaven, it, is, entirely, different, from, the, punishment, of, the, damned, and, is, not, related, to, the, forgiveness, of, sins, for, salvation, a, forgiven, person, can, be, freed, from, his, unhealthy, attachment, to, creatures, by, fervent, charity, in, this, world, and, otherwise, by, the, non, vindictive, temporal, i, e, non, eternal, punishment, of, purgatory, 1472, 1473, in, late, medieval, times, metaphors, of, time, place, and, fire, were, frequently, adopted, catherine, of, genoa, fl, 1500, re, framed, the, idea, as, ultimately, joyful, it, has, been, portrayed, in, art, as, an, unpleasant, voluntary, but, not, optional, punishment, for, unregretted, minor, sins, and, imperfect, contrition, fiery, purgatory, or, as, a, joyful, or, marvelous, final, relinquishment, of, worldly, attachments, non, fiery, purgatory, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, have, somewhat, different, formulations, of, an, intermediate, state, most, protestant, denominations, do, not, endorse, the, catholic, formulation, several, other, religions, have, concepts, resembling, purgatory, gehenna, in, judaism, al, a, raf, or, the, upper, most, layer, of, hell, in, islam, naraka, in, hinduism, the, word, purgatory, has, come, to, refer, to, a, wide, range, of, historical, and, modern, conceptions, of, postmortem, suffering, short, of, everlasting, damnation, english, speakers, also, use, the, word, analogously, to, mean, any, place, or, condition, of, suffering, or, torment, especially, one, that, is, temporary, the, noun, purgatory, in, latin, purgatorium, a, place, of, cleansing, from, the, verb, purgo, to, clean, cleanse, appeared, perhaps, only, between, 1160, and, 1180, 362, which, encouraged, speaking, of, purgatory, as, a, place, purgatory, pre, dates, the, specific, catholic, tradition, of, purgatory, as, a, transitional, state, or, condition, it, has, a, history, that, dates, back, before, christ, to, related, beliefs, also, in, judaism, that, prayer, for, the, dead, contributes, to, their, afterlife, purification, the, same, practice, appears, in, other, traditions, such, as, the, medieval, chinese, buddhist, practice, of, making, offerings, on, behalf, of, the, dead, who, are, said, to, suffer, numerous, trials, the, catholic, church, found, specific, old, testament, support, in, after, life, purification, in, 2, maccabees, 12, 42, 45, part, of, the, catholic, eastern, orthodox, oriental, orthodox, and, church, of, the, east, biblical, canons, but, regarded, as, apocryphal, by, protestants, and, major, branches, of, judaism, according, to, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, praying, for, the, dead, was, adopted, by, christians, from, the, beginning, a, practice, that, presupposes, that, the, dead, are, thereby, assisted, between, death, and, their, entry, into, their, final, abode, the, new, american, bible, revised, edition, authorized, by, the, united, states, catholic, bishops, says, in, a, note, to, the, 2, maccabees, passage, this, is, the, earliest, statement, of, the, doctrine, that, prayers, and, sacrifices, for, the, dead, are, efficacious, the, author, uses, the, story, to, demonstrate, belief, in, the, resurrection, of, the, just, and, in, the, possibility, of, expiation, for, the, sins, of, otherwise, good, people, who, have, died, this, belief, is, similar, to, but, not, quite, the, same, as, the, catholic, doctrine, of, purgatory, sacred, tradition, by, reference, to, certain, texts, of, scripture, speaks, of, the, process, as, involving, a, cleansing, fire, according, to, jacques, le, goff, in, western, europe, toward, the, end, of, the, twelfth, century, purgatory, started, to, be, represented, as, a, physical, place, 362, 366, le, goff, states, that, the, concept, involves, the, idea, of, a, purgatorial, fire, which, he, suggests, is, expiatory, and, purifying, not, punitive, like, hell, fire, at, the, second, council, of, lyon, in, 1274, when, the, catholic, church, defined, for, the, first, time, its, teaching, on, purgatory, the, eastern, orthodox, church, did, not, adopt, the, doctrine, the, council, made, no, mention, of, purgatory, as, a, third, place, or, as, containing, fire, which, are, absent, also, in, the, declarations, by, the, councils, of, florence, 1431, 1449, and, of, trent, 1545, 1563, popes, john, paul, ii, and, benedict, xvi, have, written, that, the, term, does, not, indicate, a, place, but, a, condition, of, existence, the, church, of, england, mother, church, of, the, anglican, communion, officially, denounces, what, it, calls, the, romish, doctrine, concerning, purgatory, but, the, eastern, orthodox, church, oriental, orthodox, churches, and, elements, of, the, anglican, lutheran, and, methodist, traditions, hold, that, for, some, there, is, cleansing, after, death, and, pray, for, the, dead, knowing, it, to, be, efficacious, the, reformed, churches, teach, that, the, departed, are, delivered, from, their, sins, through, the, process, of, glorification, rabbinical, judaism, also, believes, in, the, possibility, of, after, death, purification, and, may, even, use, the, word, purgatory, to, describe, the, similar, rabbinical, concept, of, gehenna, though, gehenna, is, also, sometimes, described, as, more, similar, to, hell, or, hades, some, christians, typically, roman, catholics, recognize, the, doctrine, of, purgatory, the, eastern, orthodox, are, less, likely, to, use, the, term, although, they, acknowledge, an, intermediate, state, after, death, and, before, final, judgment, and, consequentially, offer, prayers, for, the, dead, protestants, usually, do, not, recognize, purgatory, as, such, following, their, doctrine, of, sola, scriptura, they, claim, jesus, is, not, recorded, mentioning, or, otherwise, endorsing, it, and, the, old, covenant, work, 2, maccabees, is, not, accepted, by, them, as, scripture, the, catholic, church, holds, that, all, who, die, in, god, s, grace, and, friendship, but, still, imperfectly, purified, undergo, a, process, of, purification, after, death, which, the, church, calls, purgatory, so, as, to, achieve, the, holiness, necessary, to, enter, the, joy, of, heaven, though, in, popular, imagination, purgatory, is, pictured, as, a, place, rather, than, a, process, of, purification, the, idea, of, purgatory, as, a, physical, place, is, not, part, of, the, church, s, doctrine, however, the, church, s, understanding, has, typically, been, that, purgatory, has, a, temporal, temporary, terminating, non, eternal, component, with, only, god, being, outside, of, time, fire, another, important, element, of, the, purgatory, of, popular, imagination, is, also, absent, in, the, catholic, church, s, doctrine, purgatory, and, indulgences, are, defined, i, e, official, catholic, doctrines, unlike, limbo, catholicism, bases, its, teaching, also, on, the, practice, of, praying, for, the, dead, in, use, within, the, church, ever, since, the, church, began, and, mentioned, in, the, deuterocanonical, book, 2, maccabees, 12, 46, at, the, second, council, of, lyon, in, 1274, the, catholic, church, defined, for, the, first, time, its, teaching, on, purgatory, in, summary, two, points, the, council, declared, f, they, die, truly, repentant, in, charity, before, they, have, made, satisfaction, by, worthy, fruits, of, penance, for, sins, committed, and, omitted, their, souls, are, cleansed, after, death, by, purgatorical, or, purifying, punishments, and, to, relieve, punishments, of, this, kind, the, offerings, of, the, living, faithful, are, of, advantage, to, these, namely, the, sacrifices, of, masses, prayers, alms, and, other, duties, of, piety, which, have, customarily, been, performed, by, the, faithful, for, the, other, faithful, according, to, the, regulations, of, the, church, a, century, and, a, half, later, the, council, of, florence, repeated, the, same, two, points, in, practically, the, same, words, again, excluding, certain, elements, of, the, purgatory, of, popular, imagination, in, particular, fire, and, place, against, which, representatives, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, spoke, at, the, council, the, council, of, trent, repeated, the, same, two, points, and, moreover, in, its, 4, december, 1563, decree, concerning, purgatory, recommended, avoidance, of, speculations, and, non, essential, questions, let, the, more, difficult, and, subtle, questions, however, and, those, which, do, not, make, for, edification, cf, 1tm, 1, 4, and, from, which, there, is, very, often, no, increase, in, piety, be, excluded, from, popular, discourses, to, uneducated, people, likewise, let, them, not, permit, uncertain, matters, or, those, that, have, the, appearance, of, falsehood, to, be, brought, out, and, discussed, publicly, those, matters, on, the, contrary, which, tend, to, a, certain, curiosity, or, superstition, or, that, savor, of, filthy, lucre, let, them, prohibit, as, scandals, and, stumbling, blocks, to, the, faithful, catholic, doctrine, on, purgatory, is, presented, as, composed, of, the, same, two, points, in, the, compendium, of, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, first, published, in, 2005, which, is, a, summary, in, dialogue, form, of, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, it, deals, with, purgatory, in, the, following, exchange, 210, what, is, purgatory, 211, how, can, we, help, the, souls, being, purified, in, purgatory, these, two, questions, and, answers, summarize, information, in, sections, 1030, 1032, and, 1054, of, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, published, in, 1992, which, also, speaks, of, purgatory, in, sections, 1472, 1473, the, prayers, of, the, saints, in, heaven, and, the, good, deeds, works, of, mercy, prayers, and, indulgences, of, the, living, have, a, twofold, effect, they, help, the, souls, in, purgatory, atone, for, their, sins, and, they, make, the, souls, own, prayers, for, the, living, effective, since, the, merits, of, the, saints, in, heaven, on, earth, and, in, purgatory, are, part, of, the, treasury, of, merit, whenever, the, eucharist, is, celebrated, souls, in, purgatory, are, purified, i, e, they, receive, a, full, remission, of, sin, and, punishment, and, go, to, heaven, according, to, the, doctrine, of, the, catholic, church, those, who, die, in, god, s, grace, and, friendship, imperfectly, purified, although, they, are, assured, of, their, eternal, salvation, undergo, a, purification, after, death, so, as, to, achieve, the, holiness, necessary, to, enter, the, joy, of, god, unless, redeemed, by, repentance, and, god, s, forgiveness, mortal, sin, whose, object, is, grave, matter, and, is, also, committed, with, full, knowledge, and, deliberate, consent, causes, exclusion, from, christ, s, kingdom, and, the, eternal, death, of, hell, for, our, freedom, has, the, power, to, make, choices, for, ever, with, no, turning, back, such, sin, makes, us, incapable, of, eternal, life, the, privation, of, which, is, called, the, eternal, punishment, of, sin, venial, sin, while, not, depriving, the, sinner, of, friendship, with, god, or, the, eternal, happiness, of, heaven, weakens, charity, manifests, a, disordered, affection, for, created, goods, and, impedes, the, soul, s, progress, in, the, exercise, of, the, virtues, and, the, practice, of, the, moral, good, it, merits, temporal, punishment, for, every, sin, even, venial, entails, an, unhealthy, attachment, to, creatures, which, must, be, purified, either, here, on, earth, or, after, death, in, the, state, called, purgatory, this, purification, frees, one, from, what, is, called, the, temporal, punishment, of, sin, these, two, punishments, must, not, be, conceived, of, as, a, kind, of, vengeance, inflicted, by, god, from, without, but, as, following, from, the, very, nature, of, sin, a, conversion, which, proceeds, from, a, fervent, charity, can, attain, the, complete, purification, of, the, sinner, in, such, a, way, that, no, punishment, would, remain, joseph, ratzinger, has, paraphrased, this, as, purgatory, is, not, as, tertullian, thought, some, kind, of, supra, worldly, concentration, camp, where, man, is, forced, to, undergo, punishment, in, a, more, or, less, arbitrary, fashion, rather, it, is, the, inwardly, necessary, process, of, transformation, in, which, a, person, becomes, capable, of, christ, capable, of, god, and, thus, capable, of, unity, with, the, whole, communion, of, saints, this, purification, from, our, sinful, tendencies, has, been, compared, to, rehabilitation, of, someone, who, needs, to, be, cleansed, of, any, addiction, a, gradual, and, probably, painful, process, it, can, be, advanced, during, life, by, voluntary, self, mortification, and, penance, and, by, deeds, of, generosity, that, show, love, of, god, rather, than, of, creatures, if, not, completed, before, death, it, can, still, be, needed, for, entering, the, divine, presence, a, person, seeking, purification, from, sinful, tendencies, is, not, alone, because, of, the, communion, of, saints, the, holiness, of, one, profits, others, well, beyond, the, harm, that, the, sin, of, one, could, cause, others, thus, recourse, to, the, communion, of, saints, lets, the, contrite, sinner, be, more, promptly, and, efficaciously, purified, of, the, punishments, for, sin, the, catholic, church, states, that, through, the, granting, of, indulgences, for, manifestations, of, devotion, penance, and, charity, by, the, living, it, opens, for, individuals, the, treasury, of, the, merits, of, christ, and, the, saints, to, obtain, from, the, father, of, mercies, the, remission, of, the, temporal, punishments, due, for, their, sins, on, the, cusp, of, the, reformation, st, catherine, of, genoa, 1447, 1510, re, framed, the, theology, of, purgatory, as, voluntary, loving, and, even, joyful, as, for, paradise, god, has, placed, no, doors, there, whoever, wishes, to, enter, does, so, an, all, merciful, god, stands, there, with, his, arms, open, waiting, to, receive, us, into, his, glory, i, also, see, however, that, the, divine, presence, is, so, pure, and, light, filled, much, more, than, we, can, imagine, that, the, soul, that, has, but, the, slightest, imperfection, would, rather, throw, itself, into, a, thousand, hells, than, appear, thus, before, the, divine, presence, so, purgatory, is, a, state, of, both, joy, and, voluntary, pain, again, the, soul, perceives, the, grievousness, of, being, held, back, from, seeing, the, divine, light, the, soul, s, instinct, too, being, drawn, by, that, uniting, look, craves, to, be, unhindered, pope, benedict, xvi, recommended, to, theologians, the, presentation, of, purgatory, by, catherine, of, genoa, for, whom, purgatory, is, not, an, external, but, an, inner, fire, in, her, day, it, was, depicted, mainly, using, images, linked, to, space, a, certain, space, was, conceived, of, in, which, purgatory, was, supposed, to, be, located, catherine, however, did, not, see, purgatory, as, a, scene, in, the, bowels, of, the, earth, for, her, it, is, not, an, exterior, but, rather, an, interior, fire, this, is, purgatory, an, inner, fire, he, further, said, that, the, soul, catherine, says, presents, itself, to, god, still, bound, to, the, desires, and, suffering, that, derive, from, sin, and, this, makes, it, impossible, for, it, to, enjoy, the, beatific, vision, of, god, the, soul, is, aware, of, the, immense, love, and, perfect, justice, of, god, and, consequently, suffers, for, having, failed, to, respond, in, a, correct, and, perfect, way, to, this, love, and, love, for, god, itself, becomes, a, flame, love, itself, cleanses, it, from, the, residue, of, sin, in, his, 2007, encyclical, spe, salvi, pope, benedict, xvi, referring, to, the, words, of, paul, the, apostle, in, 1, corinthians, 3, 12, 15, about, a, fire, that, both, burns, and, saves, spoke, of, the, opinion, that, the, fire, which, both, burns, and, saves, is, christ, himself, the, judge, and, saviour, the, encounter, with, him, is, the, decisive, act, of, judgement, before, his, gaze, all, falsehood, melts, away, this, encounter, with, him, as, it, burns, us, transforms, and, frees, us, allowing, us, to, become, truly, ourselves, all, that, we, build, during, our, lives, can, prove, to, be, mere, straw, pure, bluster, and, it, collapses, yet, in, the, pain, of, this, encounter, when, the, impurity, and, sickness, of, our, lives, become, evident, to, us, there, lies, salvation, his, gaze, the, touch, of, his, heart, heals, us, through, an, undeniably, painful, transformation, as, through, fire, but, it, is, a, blessed, pain, in, which, the, holy, power, of, his, love, sears, through, us, like, a, flame, enabling, us, to, become, totally, ourselves, and, thus, totally, of, god, the, pain, of, love, becomes, our, salvation, and, our, joy, in, his, 2007, encyclical, spe, salvi, pope, benedict, xvi, teaches, it, is, clear, that, we, cannot, calculate, the, duration, of, this, transforming, burning, in, terms, of, the, chronological, measurements, of, this, world, the, transforming, moment, of, this, encounter, eludes, earthly, time, reckoning, it, is, the, heart, s, time, it, is, the, time, of, passage, to, communion, with, god, in, the, body, of, christ, the, popular, conceptions, of, purgatory, that, especially, in, late, medieval, times, were, common, among, catholics, of, the, latin, church, have, not, necessarily, found, acceptance, in, the, eastern, catholic, churches, of, which, there, are, 23, in, full, communion, with, the, pope, some, have, explicitly, rejected, the, notions, of, punishment, by, fire, in, a, particular, place, that, are, prominent, in, the, popular, picture, of, purgatory, the, representatives, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, at, the, council, of, florence, 1431, 1449, argued, against, these, notions, while, declaring, that, they, do, hold, that, there, is, a, cleansing, after, death, of, the, souls, of, the, saved, and, that, these, are, assisted, by, the, prayers, of, the, living, if, souls, depart, from, this, life, in, faith, and, charity, but, marked, with, some, defilements, whether, unrepented, minor, ones, or, major, ones, repented, of, but, without, having, yet, borne, the, fruits, of, repentance, we, believe, that, within, reason, they, are, purified, of, those, faults, but, not, by, some, purifying, fire, and, particular, punishments, in, some, place, the, definition, of, purgatory, adopted, by, that, council, excluded, the, two, notions, with, which, the, orthodox, disagreed, and, mentioned, only, the, two, points, that, they, said, were, part, of, their, faith, also, accordingly, the, agreement, known, as, the, union, of, brest, that, formalized, the, admission, of, the, ukrainian, greek, catholic, church, into, the, full, communion, of, the, roman, catholic, church, stated, we, shall, not, debate, about, purgatory, but, we, entrust, ourselves, to, the, teaching, of, the, holy, church, some, catholic, saints, theologians, and, laity, have, had, ideas, about, purgatory, beyond, those, adopted, by, the, catholic, church, reflecting, or, contributing, to, the, popular, image, which, includes, the, notions, of, purification, by, actual, fire, in, a, determined, place, and, for, a, precise, length, of, time, in, his, la, naissance, du, purgatoire, the, birth, of, purgatory, jacques, le, goff, attributes, the, origin, of, the, idea, of, a, third, other, world, domain, similar, to, heaven, and, hell, called, purgatory, to, paris, intellectuals, and, cistercian, monks, at, some, point, in, the, last, three, decades, of, the, twelfth, century, possibly, as, early, as, 1170, 1180, previously, the, latin, adjective, purgatorius, as, in, purgatorius, ignis, cleansing, fire, existed, but, only, then, did, the, noun, purgatorium, appear, used, as, the, name, of, a, place, called, purgatory, 167, 168, robert, bellarmine, also, taught, that, purgatory, at, least, the, ordinary, place, of, expiation, is, situated, in, the, interior, of, the, earth, that, the, souls, in, purgatory, and, the, reprobate, are, in, the, same, subterranean, space, in, the, deep, abyss, which, the, scripture, calls, hell, the, change, happened, at, about, the, same, time, as, the, composition, of, the, book, tractatus, de, purgatorio, sancti, patricii, an, account, by, an, english, cistercian, of, a, penitent, knight, s, visit, to, the, land, of, purgatory, reached, through, a, cave, in, the, island, known, as, station, island, or, st, patrick, s, purgatory, in, the, lake, of, lough, derg, county, donegal, ireland, le, goff, said, this, book, occupies, an, essential, place, in, the, history, of, purgatory, in, whose, success, it, played, an, important, if, not, decisive, role, 193, one, of, the, earliest, depictions, of, st, patrick, s, purgatory, is, a, fresco, in, the, convent, of, san, francisco, in, todi, umbria, italy, whitewashed, long, ago, this, fresco, was, only, restored, in, 1976, the, painter, was, likely, jacopo, di, mino, del, pellicciaio, and, the, date, of, the, fresco, is, around, 1345, purgatory, is, shown, as, a, rocky, hill, filled, with, separate, openings, into, its, hollow, center, above, the, mountain, st, patrick, introduces, the, prayers, of, the, faithful, that, can, help, attenuate, the, sufferings, of, the, souls, undergoing, purification, in, each, opening, sinners, are, tormented, by, demons, and, by, fire, each, of, the, seven, deadly, sins, avarice, envy, sloth, pride, anger, lust, and, gluttony, has, its, own, region, of, purgatory, and, its, own, appropriate, tortures, le, goff, dedicates, the, final, chapter, of, his, book, to, the, purgatorio, the, second, canticle, of, the, divine, comedy, a, poem, by, fourteenth, century, italian, author, dante, alighieri, in, an, interview, le, goff, declared, dante, s, purgatorio, represents, the, sublime, conclusion, of, the, slow, development, of, purgatory, that, took, place, in, the, course, of, the, middle, ages, the, power, of, dante, s, poetry, made, a, decisive, contribution, to, fixing, in, the, public, imagination, this, third, place, whose, birth, was, on, the, whole, quite, recent, dante, pictures, purgatory, as, an, island, at, the, antipodes, of, jerusalem, pushed, up, in, an, otherwise, empty, sea, by, the, displacement, caused, by, the, fall, of, satan, which, left, him, fixed, at, the, central, point, of, the, globe, of, the, earth, the, cone, shaped, island, has, seven, terraces, on, which, souls, are, cleansed, from, the, seven, deadly, sins, or, capital, vices, as, they, ascend, additional, spurs, at, the, base, hold, those, for, whom, beginning, the, ascent, is, delayed, because, in, life, they, were, excommunicates, indolent, or, late, repenters, at, the, summit, is, the, garden, of, eden, from, where, the, souls, cleansed, of, evil, tendencies, and, made, perfect, are, taken, to, heaven, the, catholic, church, has, included, in, its, teaching, the, idea, of, a, purgatory, rather, as, a, condition, than, a, place, on, 4, august, 1999, pope, john, paul, ii, speaking, of, purgatory, said, the, term, does, not, indicate, a, place, but, a, condition, of, existence, those, who, after, death, exist, in, a, state, of, purification, are, already, in, the, love, of, christ, who, removes, from, them, the, remnants, of, imperfection, as, a, condition, of, existence, fire, has, an, important, place, in, the, popular, image, of, purgatory, and, has, been, the, object, of, speculation, by, theologians, speculation, to, which, the, article, on, purgatory, in, the, catholic, encyclopedia, relates, the, warning, by, the, council, of, trent, against, difficult, and, subtle, questions, which, tend, not, to, edification, fire, has, never, been, included, in, the, catholic, church, s, defined, doctrine, on, purgatory, but, speculation, about, it, is, traditional, the, tradition, of, the, church, by, reference, to, certain, texts, of, scripture, speaks, of, a, cleansing, fire, in, this, regard, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, references, in, particular, two, new, testament, passages, if, anyone, s, work, is, burned, up, he, will, suffer, loss, though, he, himself, will, be, saved, but, only, as, through, fire, and, so, that, the, tested, genuineness, of, your, faith, more, precious, than, gold, that, perishes, though, it, is, tested, by, fire, may, be, found, to, result, in, praise, and, glory, and, honor, at, the, revelation, of, jesus, christ, catholic, theologians, have, also, cited, verses, such, as, i, will, put, this, third, into, the, fire, and, refine, them, as, one, refines, silver, and, test, them, as, gold, is, tested, they, will,

10, 15, seen, as, referring, to, a, process, by, which, the, dross, of, lighter, transgressions, will, be, burnt, away, and, the, soul, thus, purified, will, be, saved, wrote, suppose, you, have, built, after, the, foundation, which, christ, jesus, has, taught, not, only, gold, silver, and, precious, stones, if, indeed, you, possess, gold, and, much, silver, or, little, suppose, you, have, silver, precious, stones, but, i, say, not, only, these, elements, but, suppose, that, you, have, also, wood, and, hay, and, stubble, what, does, he, wish, you, to, become, after, your, final, departure, to, enter, afterwards, then, into, the, holy, lands, with, your, wood, and, with, your, hay, and, stubble, so, that, you, may, defile, the, kingdom, of, god, but, again, do, you, want, to, be, left, behind, in, the, fire, on, account, of, the, hay, the, wood, the, stubble, and, to, receive, nothing, due, you, for, the, gold, and, the, silver, and, precious, stone, that, is, not, reasonable, what, then, it, follows, that, you, receive, the, fire, first, due, to, the, wood, and, the, hay, and, the, stubble, for, to, those, able, to, perceive, our, god, is, said, to, be, in, reality, a, consuming, fire, origen, also, speaks, of, a, refining, fire, melting, away, the, lead, of, evil, deeds, leaving, behind, only, pure, gold, augustine, tentatively, put, forward, the, idea, of, a, post, death, purgatorial, fire, for, some, christian, believers, 69, it, is, not, incredible, that, something, like, this, should, occur, after, this, life, whether, or, not, it, is, a, matter, for, fruitful, inquiry, it, may, be, discovered, or, remain, hidden, whether, some, of, the, faithful, are, sooner, or, later, to, be, saved, by, a, sort, of, purgatorial, fire, in, proportion, as, they, have, loved, the, goods, that, perish, and, in, proportion, to, their, attachment, to, them, gregory, the, great, also, argued, for, the, existence, before, judgment, of, a, purgatorius, ignis,

establish, purgatory, but, yet, we, must, believe, that, before, the, day, of, judgment, there, is, a, purgatory, fire, for, certain, small, sins, because, our, saviour, saith, that, he, which, speaketh, blasphemy, against, the, holy, ghost, that, it, shall, not, be, forgiven, him, neither, in, this, world, nor, in, the, world, to, come, mat, 12, 32, out, of, which, sentence, we, learn, that, some, sins, are, forgiven, in, this, world, and, some, other, may, be, pardoned, in, the, next, for, that, which, is, denied, concerning, one, sin, is, consequently, understood, to, be, granted, touching, some, other, gregory, of, nyssa, several, times, spoke, of, purgation, by, fire, after, death, but, he, generally, has, apocatastasis, in, mind, medieval, theologians, accepted, the, association, of, purgatory, with, fire, thus, the, summa, theologica, of, thomas, aquinas, considered, it, probable, that, purgatory, was, situated, close, to, hell, so, that, the, same, fire, that, tormented, the, damned, cleansed, the, just, souls, in, purgatory, ideas, about, the, supposed, fire, of, purgatory, have, changed, with, time, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, catholic, encyclopedia, reported, that, while, in, the, past, most, theologians, had, held, that, the, fire, of, purgatory, was, in, some, sense, a, material, fire, though, of, a, nature, different, from, ordinary, fire, the, view, of, what, then, seemed, to, be, the, majority, of, theologians, was, that, the, term, was, to, be, understood, metaphorically, while, the, eastern, orthodox, church, rejects, the, term, purgatory, it, acknowledges, an, intermediate, state, after, death, and, before, final, judgment, and, offers, prayer, for, the, dead, according, to, the, greek, orthodox, archdiocese, of, america, the, moral, progress, of, the, soul, either, for, better, or, for, worse, ends, at, the, very, moment, of, the, separation, of, the, body, and, soul, at, that, very, moment, the, definite, destiny, of, the, soul, in, the, everlasting, life, is, decided, there, is, no, way, of, repentance, no, way, of, escape, no, reincarnation, and, no, help, from, the, outside, world, its, place, is, decided, forever, by, its, creator, and, judge, the, orthodox, church, does, not, believe, in, purgatory, a, place, of, purging, that, is, the, inter, mediate, state, after, death, in, which, the, souls, of, the, saved, those, who, have, not, received, temporal, punishment, for, their, sins, are, purified, of, all, taint, preparatory, to, entering, into, heaven, where, every, soul, is, perfect, and, fit, to, see, god, also, the, orthodox, church, does, not, believe, in, indulgences, as, remissions, from, purgatorial, punishment, both, purgatory, and, indulgences, are, inter, corelated, theories, unwitnessed, in, the, bible, or, in, the, ancient, church, and, when, they, were, enforced, and, applied, they, brought, about, evil, practices, at, the, expense, of, the, prevailing, truths, of, the, church, if, almighty, god, in, his, merciful, loving, kindness, changes, the, dreadful, situation, of, the, sinner, it, is, unknown, to, the, church, of, christ, the, church, lived, for, fifteen, hundred, years, without, such, a, theory, eastern, orthodox, teaching, is, that, while, all, undergo, an, individual, judgment, immediately, after, death, neither, the, just, nor, the, wicked, attain, the, final, state, of, bliss, or, punishment, before, the, last, day, with, some, exceptions, for, righteous, souls, like, the, theotokos, blessed, virgin, mary, who, was, borne, by, the, angels, directly, to, heaven, the, eastern, orthodox, church, holds, that, it, is, necessary, to, believe, in, this, intermediate, after, death, state, in, which, souls, are, perfected, and, brought, to, full, divinization, a, process, of, growth, rather, than, of, punishment, which, some, orthodox, have, called, purgatory, eastern, orthodox, theology, does, not, generally, describe, the, situation, of, the, dead, as, involving, suffering, or, fire, although, it, nevertheless, describes, it, as, a, direful, condition, the, souls, of, the, righteous, dead, are, in, light, and, rest, with, a, foretaste, of, eternal, happiness, but, the, souls, of, the, wicked, are, in, a, state, the, reverse, of, this, among, the, latter, such, souls, as, have, departed, with, faith, but, without, having, had, time, to, bring, forth, fruits, worthy, of, repentance, may, be, aided, towards, the, attainment, of, a, blessed, resurrection, by, prayers, offered, in, their, behalf, especially, those, offered, in, union, with, the, oblation, of, the, bloodless, sacrifice, of, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, and, by, works, of, mercy, done, in, faith, for, their, memory, the, state, in, which, souls, undergo, this, experience, is, often, referred, to, as, hades, the, orthodox, confession, of, peter, mogila, 1596, 1646, adopted, in, a, greek, translation, by, meletius, syrigos, by, the, 1642, council, of, jassy, in, romania, professes, that, many, are, freed, from, the, prison, of, hell, through, the, good, works, of, the, living, and, the, church, s, prayers, for, them, most, of, all, through, the, unbloody, sacrifice, which, is, offered, on, certain, days, for, all, the, living, and, the, dead, question, 64, and, under, the, heading, how, must, one, consider, the, purgatorial, fire, the, church, rightly, performs, for, them, the, unbloody, sacrifice, and, prayers, but, they, do, not, cleanse, themselves, by, suffering, something, the, church, never, maintained, that, which, pertains, to, the, fanciful, stories, of, some, concerning, the, souls, of, their, dead, who, have, not, done, penance, and, are, punished, as, it, were, in, streams, springs, and, swamps, question, 66, the, eastern, orthodox, synod, of, jerusalem, 1672, declared, the, souls, of, those, that, have, fallen, asleep, are, either, at, rest, or, in, torment, according, to, what, each, hath, wrought, an, enjoyment, or, condemnation, that, will, be, complete, only, after, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, but, the, souls, of, some, depart, into, hades, and, there, endure, the, punishment, due, to, the, sins, they, have, committed, but, they, are, aware, of, their, future, release, from, there, and, are, delivered, by, the, supreme, goodness, through, the, prayers, of, the, priests, and, the, good, works, which, the, relatives, of, each, do, for, their, departed, especially, the, unbloody, sacrifice, benefiting, the, most, which, each, offers, particularly, for, his, relatives, that, have, fallen, asleep, and, which, the, catholic, and, apostolic, church, offers, daily, for, all, alike, of, course, it, is, understood, that, we, do, not, know, the, time, of, their, release, we, know, and, believe, that, there, is, deliverance, for, such, from, their, direful, condition, and, that, before, the, common, resurrection, and, judgment, but, when, we, know, not, some, orthodox, believe, in, a, teaching, of, aerial, toll, houses, for, the, souls, of, the, dead, according, to, this, theory, which, is, rejected, by, other, orthodox, but, appears, in, the, hymnology, of, the, church, following, a, person, s, death, the, soul, leaves, the, body, and, is, escorted, to, god, by, angels, during, this, journey, the, soul, passes, through, an, aerial, realm, which, is, ruled, by, demons, the, soul, encounters, these, demons, at, various, points, referred, to, as, toll, houses, where, the, demons, then, attempt, to, accuse, it, of, sin, and, if, possible, drag, the, soul, into, hell, some, early, patristic, theologians, of, the, eastern, church, taught, and, believed, in, apocatastasis, the, belief, that, all, creation, would, be, restored, to, its, original, perfect, condition, after, a, remedial, purgatorial, reformation, clement, of, alexandria, was, one, of, the, early, church, theologians, who, taught, this, view, in, general, protestant, churches, reject, the, catholic, doctrine, of, purgatory, although, some, teach, the, existence, of, an, intermediate, state, which, is, termed, hades, however, protestant, churches, that, affirm, the, existence, of, an, intermediate, state, hades, reject, the, roman, catholic, view, that, it, is, a, place, of, purgation, affirming, the, existence, of, an, intermediate, state, adherents, of, certain, protestant, denominations, such, as, those, of, the, lutheran, churches, say, prayers, for, the, dead, reformed, protestants, consistent, with, the, views, of, john, calvin, hold, that, a, person, enters, into, the, fullness, of, one, s, bliss, or, torment, only, after, the, resurrection, of, the, body, and, that, the, soul, in, that, interim, state, is, conscious, and, aware, of, the, fate, in, store, for, it, others, such, as, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, have, held, that, souls, in, the, intermediate, state, between, death, and, resurrection, are, without, consciousness, a, state, known, as, soul, sleep, the, general, protestant, view, is, that, the, biblical, canon, from, which, protestants, exclude, deuterocanonical, books, such, as, 2, maccabees, though, this, book, is, included, in, traditional, protestant, bibles, in, the, intertestamental, apocrypha, section, contains, no, overt, explicit, discussion, of, purgatory, as, taught, in, the, roman, catholic, sense, and, therefore, it, should, be, rejected, as, an, unbiblical, belief, the, reality, of, purgatorial, purification, is, envisaged, in, thomas, talbott, s, the, inescapable, love, of, god, different, views, are, expressed, by, different, theologians, in, two, different, editions, of, four, views, of, hell, the, lutheran, churches, teach, the, existence, of, an, intermediate, state, after, the, departure, of, the, soul, from, the, body, until, the, time, of, the, last, judgment, this, intermediate, state, known, as, hades, is, divided, into, two, chambers, 1, paradise, for, the, righteous, 2, gehenna, for, the, wicked, unlike, the, roman, catholic, doctrine, of, purgatory, the, lutheran, doctrine, of, hades, is, not, a, place, of, purgation, beside, the, divine, narrative, informs, us, that, there, is, an, impassable, gulf, dividing, hades, into, two, apartments, and, so, great, is, this, chasm, as, to, render, it, impossible, to, pass, from, one, apartment, to, the, other, and, therefore, as, this, rich, man, and, lazarus, are, not, on, the, same, side, of, the, gulf, they, are, not, in, the, same, place, they, are, both, in, hades, but, not, the, same, apartment, of, it, the, apartment, to, which, the, rich, man, went, the, scriptures, call, hell, and, that, to, which, lazarus, went, they, call, paradise, abraham, s, bosom, paradise, heaven, and, therefore, inasmuch, as, all, spirits, upon, hearing, their, sentence, must, pass, away, into, one, of, these, apartments, it, is, conclusive, that, the, good, will, go, to, where, lazarus, and, the, dying, thief, are, with, jesus, in, heaven, which, is, in, hades, and, the, bad, will, go, where, the, rich, man, is, in, hell, also, in, hades, so, that, the, spirit, after, its, departure, from, the, body, after, hearing, its, doom, and, upon, the, execution, of, the, sentence, enters, immediately, into, hades, either, to, a, state, and, place, of, suffering, or, of, enjoyment, and, here, in, hades, the, righteous, enjoy, bliss, such, as, eye, hath, not, seen, nor, ear, heard, not, the, heart, of, man, conceived, but, the, wicked, experience, miseries, such, as, are, represented, by, the, gnawings, of, the, worm, that, never, dies, and, burnings, of, the, fire, that, is, never, quenched, but, once, more, the, state, of, spirits, in, hades, between, death, and, judgment, is, not, one, of, probation, nor, yet, or, purgation, the, protestant, reformer, martin, luther, was, once, recorded, as, saying, as, for, purgatory, no, place, in, scripture, makes, mention, thereof, neither, must, we, any, way, allow, it, for, it, darkens, and, undervalues, the, grace, benefits, and, merits, of, our, blessed, sweet, saviour, christ, jesus, the, bounds, of, purgatory, extend, not, beyond, this, world, for, here, in, this, life, the, upright, good, and, godly, christians, are, well, and, soundly, scoured, and, purged, in, his, 1537, smalcald, articles, luther, stated, therefore, purgatory, and, every, solemnity, rite, and, commerce, connected, with, it, is, to, be, regarded, as, nothing, but, a, specter, of, the, devil, for, it, conflicts, with, the, chief, article, that, only, christ, and, not, the, works, of, men, are, to, help, souls, not, to, mention, the, fact, that, nothing, has, been, commanded, or, enjoined, upon, us, concerning, the, dead, with, respect, to, the, related, practice, of, praying, for, the, dead, luther, stated, as, for, the, dead, since, scripture, gives, us, no, information, on, the, subject, i, regard, it, as, no, sin, to, pray, with, free, devotion, in, this, or, some, similar, fashion, dear, god, if, this, soul, is, in, a, condition, accessible, to, mercy, be, thou, gracious, to, it, and, when, this, has, been, done, once, or, twice, let, it, suffice, confession, concerning, christ, s, supper, vol, xxxvii, 369, a, core, statement, of, lutheran, doctrine, from, the, book, of, concord, states, we, know, that, the, ancients, speak, of, prayer, for, the, dead, which, we, do, not, prohibit, but, we, disapprove, of, the, application, ex, opere, operato, of, the, lord, s, supper, on, behalf, of, the, dead, epiphanius, testifies, that, aerius, held, that, prayers, for, the, dead, are, useless, with, this, he, finds, fault, neither, do, we, favor, aerius, but, we, do, argue, with, you, because, you, defend, a, heresy, that, clearly, conflicts, with, the, prophets, apostles, and, holy, fathers, namely, that, the, mass, justifies, ex, opere, operato, that, it, merits, the, remission, of, guilt, and, punishment, even, for, the, unjust, to, whom, it, is, applied, if, they, do, not, present, an, obstacle, philipp, melanchthon, apology, of, the, augsburg, confession, high, church, lutheranism, like, anglo, catholicism, is, more, likely, to, accept, some, form, of, purgatory, lutheran, reformer, mikael, agricola, still, believed, in, the, basic, beliefs, of, purgatory, purgatory, as, such, is, not, mentioned, at, all, in, the, augsburg, confession, which, claims, that, our, churches, dissent, in, no, article, of, the, faith, from, the, church, catholic, but, only, omit, some, abuses, which, are, new, anglicans, as, with, other, reformed, churches, historically, teach, that, the, saved, undergo, the, process, of, glorification, after, death, this, process, has, been, compared, by, jerry, l, walls, and, james, b, gould, with, the, process, of, purification, in, the, core, doctrine, of, purgatory, see, reformed, below, purgatory, was, addressed, by, both, of, the, foundation, features, of, anglicanism, in, the, 16th, century, the, thirty, nine, articles, of, religion, and, the, book, of, common, prayer, article, xxii, of, the, thirty, nine, articles, states, that, the, romish, doctrine, concerning, purgatory, is, a, fond, thing, vainly, invented, and, grounded, upon, no, warranty, of, scripture, but, rather, repugnant, to, the, word, of, god, prayers, for, the, departed, were, deleted, from, the, 1552, book, of, common, prayer, because, they, suggested, a, doctrine, of, purgatory, the, 19th, century, anglo, catholic, revival, led, to, restoring, prayers, for, the, dead, john, henry, newman, in, his, tract, xc, of, 1841, 6, discussed, article, xxii, he, highlighted, the, fact, that, it, is, the, romish, doctrine, of, purgatory, coupled, with, indulgences, that, article, xxii, condemns, as, repugnant, to, the, word, of, god, the, article, did, not, condemn, every, doctrine, of, purgatory, and, it, did, not, condemn, prayers, for, the, dead, shortly, before, becoming, a, roman, catholic, john, henry, newman, argued, that, the, essence, of, the, doctrine, is, locatable, in, ancient, tradition, and, that, the, core, consistency, of, such, beliefs, is, evidence, that, christianity, was, originally, given, to, us, from, heaven, as, of, the, year, 2000, the, state, of, the, doctrine, of, purgatory, in, anglicanism, was, summarized, as, follows, purgatory, is, seldom, mentioned, in, anglican, descriptions, or, speculations, concerning, life, after, death, although, many, anglicans, believe, in, a, continuing, process, of, growth, and, development, after, death, anglican, bishop, john, henry, hobart, 1775, 1830, wrote, that, hades, or, the, place, of, the, dead, is, represented, as, a, spacious, receptacle, with, gates, through, which, the, dead, enter, the, anglican, catechist, of, 1855, elaborated, on, hades, stating, that, it, is, an, intermediate, state, between, death, and, the, resurrection, in, which, the, soul, does, not, sleep, in, unconsciousness, but, exists, in, happiness, or, misery, till, the, resurrection, when, it, shall, be, reunited, to, the, body, and, receive, its, final, reward, this, intermediate, state, includes, both, paradise, and, gehenna, but, with, an, impassable, gulf, between, the, two, souls, remain, in, hades, until, the, final, judgment, and, christians, may, also, improve, in, holiness, after, death, during, the, middle, state, before, the, final, judgment, leonel, l, mitchell, 1930, 2012, offers, this, rationale, for, prayers, for, the, dead, no, one, is, ready, at, the, time, of, death, to, enter, into, life, in, the, nearer, presence, of, god, without, substantial, growth, precisely, in, love, knowledge, and, service, and, the, prayer, also, recognizes, that, god, will, provide, what, is, necessary, for, us, to, enter, that, state, this, growth, will, presumably, be, between, death, and, resurrection, anglican, theologian, c, s, lewis, 1898, 1963, reflecting, on, the, history, of, the, doctrine, of, purgatory, in, the, anglican, communion, said, there, were, good, reasons, for, casting, doubt, on, the, romish, doctrine, concerning, purgatory, as, that, romish, doctrine, had, then, become, not, merely, a, commercial, scandal, but, also, the, picture, in, which, the, souls, are, tormented, by, devils, whose, presence, is, more, horrible, and, grievous, to, us, than, is, the, pain, itself, and, where, the, spirit, who, suffers, the, tortures, cannot, for, pain, remember, god, as, he, ought, to, do, lewis, believed, instead, in, purgatory, as, presented, in, john, henry, newman, s, the, dream, of, gerontius, by, this, poem, lewis, wrote, religion, has, reclaimed, purgatory, a, process, of, purification, that, will, normally, involve, suffering, lewis, s, allegory, the, great, divorce, 1945, considered, a, version, of, purgatory, in, the, related, idea, of, a, refrigidarium, the, opportunity, for, souls, to, visit, a, lower, region, of, heaven, and, choose, to, be, saved, or, not, methodist, churches, in, keeping, with, article, xiv, of, purgatory, in, the, articles, of, religion, hold, that, the, romish, doctrine, concerning, purgatory, is, a, fond, thing, vainly, invented, and, grounded, upon, no, warrant, of, scripture, but, repugnant, to, the, word, of, god, however, in, traditional, methodism, there, is, a, belief, in, hades, the, intermediate, state, of, souls, between, death, and, the, general, resurrection, which, is, divided, into, paradise, for, the, righteous, and, gehenna, for, the, wicked, after, the, general, judgment, hades, will, be, abolished, john, wesley, the, founder, of, methodism, made, a, distinction, between, hell, the, receptacle, of, the, damned, and, hades, the, receptacle, of, all, separate, spirits, and, also, between, paradise, the, antechamber, of, heaven, and, heaven, itself, the, dead, will, remain, in, hades, until, the, day, of, judgment, when, we, will, all, be, bodily, resurrected, and, stand, before, christ, as, our, judge, after, the, judgment, the, righteous, will, go, to, their, eternal, reward, in, heaven, and, the, accursed, will, depart, to, hell, see, matthew, 25, after, death, reformed, theology, teaches, that, through, glorification, god, not, only, delivers, his, people, from, all, their, suffering, and, from, death, but, delivers, them, too, from, all, their, sins, in, glorification, reformed, christians, believe, that, the, departed, are, raised, and, made, like, the, glorious, body, of, christ, theologian, john, f, macarthur, has, written, that, nothing, in, scripture, even, hints, at, the, notion, of, purgatory, and, nothing, indicates, that, our, glorification, will, in, any, way, be, painful, jerry, l, walls, and, james, b, gould, have, likened, the, glorification, process, to, the, core, or, sanctification, view, of, purgatory, grace, is, much, more, than, forgiveness, it, is, also, transformation, and, sanctification, and, finally, glorification, we, need, more, than, forgiveness, and, justification, to, purge, our, sinful, dispositions, and, make, us, fully, ready, for, heaven, purgatory, is, nothing, more, than, the, continuation, of, the, sanctifying, grace, we, need, for, as, long, as, necessary, to, complete, the, job, as, an, argument, for, the, existence, of, purgatory, protestant, religious, philosopher, jerry, l, walls, wrote, purgatory, the, logic, of, total, transformation, 2012, he, lists, some, biblical, hints, of, purgatory, mal, 3, 2, 2, mac, 12, 41, 43, mat, 12, 32, 1, cor, 3, 12, 15, that, helped, give, rise, to, the, doctrine, and, finds, its, beginnings, in, early, christian, writers, whom, he, calls, fathers, and, mothers, of, purgatory, citing, le, goff, he, sees, the, 12th, century, as, that, of, the, birth, of, purgatory, arising, as, a, natural, development, of, certain, currents, of, thought, that, had, been, flowing, for, centuries, and, the, 13th, century, at, that, of, its, rationalization, purging, it, of, its, offensive, popular, trappings, leading, to, its, definition, by, a, council, as, the, church, s, doctrine, in, 1274, walls, does, not, base, his, belief, in, purgatory, primarily, on, scripture, the, mothers, and, fathers, of, the, church, or, the, magisterium, doctrinal, authority, of, the, catholic, church, rather, his, basic, argument, is, that, in, a, phrase, he, often, uses, it, makes, sense, for, walls, purgatory, has, a, logic, as, in, the, title, of, his, book, he, documents, the, contrast, between, the, satisfaction,

might, be, pictured, as, a, regimen, to, regain, one, s, spiritual, health, and, get, back, into, moral, shape, in, catholic, theology, walls, claims, that, the, doctrine, of, purgatory, has, swung, between, the, poles, of, satisfaction, and, sanctification, sometimes, combining, both, elements, somewhere, in, the, middle, he, believes, the, sanctification, model, can, be, affirmed, by, protestants, without, in, any, way, contradicting, their, theology, and, that, they, may, find, that, it, makes, better, sense, of, how, the, remains, of, sin, are, purged, than, an, instantaneous, cleansing, at, the, moment, of, death, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, teaches, of, an, intermediate, place, for, spirits, between, their, death, and, their, bodily,

the, spirits, in, prison, who, can, still, accept, salvation, in, this, sense, spirit, prison, can, be, conceptualized, as, a, type, of, purgatory, in, addition, to, hearing, the, message, from, the, missionary, spirits, the, spirits, in, prison, can, also, accept, posthumous, baptism, and, other, posthumous, ordinances, performed, by, living, church, members, in, temples, on, earth, this, is,

up, to, a, year, before, release, the, view, of, purgatory, can, be, found, in, the, teaching, of, the, shammaites, in, the, last, judgment, day, there, shall, be, three, classes, of, souls, the, righteous, shall, at, once, be, written, down, for, the, life, everlasting, the, wicked, for, gehenna, but, those, whose, virtues, and, sins, counterbalance, one, another, shall, go, down, to, gehenna, and, float, up, and, down, until, they, rise, purified, for, of, them, it, is, said, i, will, bring, the, third, part, into, the, fire, and, refine, them, as, silver, is, refined, and, try, them, as, gold, is, tried, also, he, bringeth, down, to, sheol, and, bringeth, up, again, i, sam, ii, 6, the, hillelites, seem, to, have, had, no, purgatory, for, they, said, he, who, is, plenteous, in, mercy, inclines, the, balance, toward, mercy, and, consequently, the, intermediates, do, not, descend, into, gehenna, tosef, sanh, xiii, 3, r, h, 16b, bacher, ag, tan, i, 18, still, they, also, speak, of, an, intermediate, state, regarding, the, time, which, purgatory, lasts, the, accepted, opinion, of, r, akiba, is, twelve, months, according, to, r, johanan, b, nuri, it, is, only, forty, nine, days, both, opinions, are, based, upon, isa, lxvi, 23, 24, from, one, new, moon, to, another, and, from, one, sabbath, to, another, shall, all, flesh, come, to, worship, before, me, and, they,

interpreting, the, words, from, one, new, moon, to, another, to, signify, all, the, months, of, a, year, the, latter, interpreting, the, words, from, one, sabbath, to, another, in, accordance, with, lev, xxiii, 15, 16, to, signify, seven, weeks, during, the, twelve, months, declares, the, baraita, tosef, sanh, xiii, 4, 5, r, h, 16b, the, souls, of, the, wicked, are, judged, and, after, these, twelve, months, are, over, they, are, consumed, and, transformed, into, ashes, under, the, feet, of, the, righteous, according, to, mal, iii, 21, whereas, the, great, seducers, and, blasphemers, are, to, undergo, eternal, tortures, in, gehenna, without, cessation, according, to, isa, lxvi, 24, the, righteous, however, and, according, to, some, also, the, sinners, among, the, people, of, israel, for, whom, abraham, intercedes, because, they, bear, the, abrahamic, sign, of, the, covenant, are, not, harmed, by, the, fire, of, gehenna, even, when, they, are, required, to, pass, through, the, intermediate, state, of, purgatory, er, 19b, ag, 27a, maimonides, declares, in, his, 13, principles, of, faith, that, the, descriptions, of, gehenna, as, a, place, of, punishment, in, rabbinic, literature, were, pedagocically, motivated, inventions, to, encourage, respect, of, the, torah, commandments, by, mankind, which, had, been, regarded, as, immature, instead, of, being, sent, to, gehenna, the, souls, of, the, wicked, would, actually, get, annihilated, in, mandaean, cosmology, the, soul, must, go, through, multiple, ma, arta, i, e, purgatories, watch, stations, or, toll, stations, after, death, before, finally, reaching, the, world, of, light, heaven, the, mandaeans, believe, in, purification, of, souls, inside, of, leviathan, whom, they, also, call, ur, jahannam, refers, to, both, the, entirety, of, hell, as, well, as, to, its, upper, most, layer, barzakh, is, the, intermediate, place, the, dead, go, before, reckoning, al, a, raf, also, has, similarities, to, purgatory, or, limbo, jahannam, has, been, conceptualized, as, a, temporary, place, for, muslim, sinners, unlike, the, rest, of, hell, when, the, last, muslim, sinner, repented, jahannam, would, cease, to, exist, some, scholars, asserted, by, referring, to, god, s, mercy, r, ra, m, ni, r, ra, mi, that, hell, will, eventually, end, this, doctrine, is, referred, to, as, fana, al, nar, annihilation, of, fire, however, this, doctrine, is, not, universally, accepted, in, islam, and, rejected, by, the, majority, while, hell, in, hinduism, is, not, typically, considered, to, be, a, central, feature, of, the, religion, it, does, exist, hell, for, hindus, involves, the, realm, of, naraka, naraka, is, not, a, permanent, place, for, the, soul, after, death, but, a, realm, related, to, punishment, for, moral, impure, deeds, it, functions, more, like, a, prison, than, the, hell, of, for, instance, traditional, christianity, there, are, a, few, different, views, of, naraka, in, hinduism, one, of, these, discussed, in, the, mah, bh, rata, holds, that, one, goes, from, naraka, s, punishment, straight, to, heaven, svarga, in, their, next, life, though, this, celestial, realm, is, distinct, from, the, ultimate, form, of, salvation, in, hinduism, spiritual, liberation, from, the, cycle, of, rebirth, known, as, mok, a, another, view, is, that, after, naraka, one, would, then, proceed, to, be, reborn, as, an, animal, and, just, continue, the, cycle, of, rebirth, according, to, zoroastrian, eschatology, the, wicked, will, get, purified, in, molten, metal
