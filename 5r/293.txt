the, zhuangzi, historically, romanized, chuang, tz, is, an, ancient, chinese, text, that, is, one, of, the, two, foundational, texts, of, taoism, alongside, the, tao, te, ching, it, was, written, during, the, late, warring, states, period, 476, 221, bc, and, is, named, for, its, traditional, author, zhuang, zhou, who, is, customarily, known, as, zhuangzi, master, zhuang, the, zhuangzi, consists, of, stories, and, maxims, that, exemplify, the, nature, of, the, ideal, taoist, sage, it, contains, numerous, anecdotes, allegories, parables, and, fables, often, expressed, with, irreverence, or, humor, recurring, themes, include, embracing, spontaneity, and, achieving, freedom, from, the, human, world, and, its, conventions, the, text, aims, to, illustrate, the, arbitrariness, and, ultimate, falsity, of, dichotomies, normally, embraced, by, human, societies, such, as, those, between, good, and, bad, large, and, small, life, and, death, or, human, and, nature, in, contrast, with, the, focus, on, good, morals, and, personal, duty, expressed, by, many, chinese, philosophers, of, the, period, zhuang, zhou, promoted, carefree, wandering, and, following, nature, through, which, one, would, ultimately, become, one, with, the, way, tao, though, appreciation, for, the, work, often, focuses, on, its, philosophy, the, zhuangzi, is, also, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, works, of, literature, in, the, classical, chinese, canon, it, has, significantly, influenced, major, chinese, writers, and, poets, across, more, than, two, millennia, with, the, first, attested, commentary, on, the, work, written, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, it, has, been, called, the, most, important, pre, qin, text, for, the, study, of, chinese, literature, the, zhuangzi, is, presented, as, the, collected, works, of, a, man, named, zhuang, zhou, traditionally, referred, to, as, zhuangzi, master, zhuang, using, the, traditional, chinese, honorific, almost, nothing, is, concretely, known, of, zhuang, zhou, s, life, most, what, is, known, comes, from, the, zhuangzi, itself, which, was, subject, to, changes, in, later, centuries, most, historians, place, his, birth, around, 369, bc, in, a, place, called, meng, in, the, historical, state, of, song, near, present, day, shangqiu, henan, his, death, is, variously, placed, at, 301, 295, or, 286, bc, zhuang, zhou, is, thought, to, have, spent, time, in, the, southern, state, of, chu, as, well, as, in, the, qi, capital, of, linzi, sima, qian, included, a, biography, of, zhuang, zhou, in, the, han, era, shiji, c, 91, bc, but, it, seems, to, have, been, sourced, mostly, from, the, zhuangzi, itself, the, american, sinologist, burton, watson, concluded, whoever, zhuang, zhou, was, the, writings, attributed, to, him, bear, the, stamp, of, a, brilliant, and, original, mind, university, of, sydney, lecturer, esther, klein, observes, in, the, perception, of, the, vast, majority, of, readers, whoever, authored, the, core, zhuangzi, text, was, master, zhuang, the, only, version, of, the, zhuangzi, known, to, exist, in, its, entirety, consists, of, 33, chapters, originally, prepared, around, ad, 300, by, the, jin, era, scholar, guo, xiang, 252, 312, who, reduced, the, text, from, an, earlier, collection, of, 52, chapters, the, first, 7, of, these, referred, to, as, the, inner, chapters, n, ipi, n, were, considered, even, before, guo, to, have, been, wholly, authored, by, zhuang, zhou, himself, this, attribution, has, been, traditionally, accepted, since, and, is, still, assumed, by, many, modern, scholars, the, original, authorship, of, the, remaining, 26, chapters, has, been, the, subject, of, perennial, debate, they, were, divided, by, guo, into, 15, outer, chapters, w, ipi, n, and, 11, miscellaneous, chapters, z, pi, n, today, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, outer, and, miscellaneous, chapters, were, the, result, of, a, process, of, accretion, and, redaction, in, which, later, authors, to, the, scintillating, brilliance, of, the, original, inner, chapters, although, close, intertextual, analysis, does, not, support, the, inner, chapters, comprising, the, earliest, stratum, multiple, authorship, over, time, was, a, typical, feature, of, warring, states, texts, of, this, genre, a, limited, consensus, has, been, established, regarding, five, distinct, schools, of, authorship, each, responsible, for, their, own, layers, of, substance, within, the, text, despite, the, lack, of, traceable, attribution, modern, scholars, generally, accept, that, the, surviving, chapters, were, originally, composed, between, the, 4th, and, 2nd, centuries, bc, excepting, textual, analysis, details, of, the, text, s, history, prior, to, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, are, largely, unknown, traces, of, its, influence, on, the, philosophy, of, texts, written, during, the, late, warring, states, period, such, as, the, guanzi, han, feizi, huainanzi, and, spring, and, autumn, annals, suggest, that, the, zhuangzi, s, intellectual, lineage, had, already, been, fairly, influential, in, the, states, of, qi, and, chu, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, sima, qian, refers, to, the, zhuangzi, as, a, 100, 000, character, work, in, the, shiji, and, references, several, chapters, present, in, the, received, text, many, scholars, consider, a, zhuangzi, composed, of, 52, chapters, as, attested, by, the, book, of, han, in, 111, ad, as, being, the, original, form, of, the, text, during, the, late, 1st, century, bc, the, entire, han, imperial, library, including, its, edition, of, the, zhuangzi, was, subject, to, considerable, redaction, and, standardization, by, the, polymath, liu, xiang, 77, 6, bc, which, was, continued, by, his, son, liu, xin, c, 46, bc, ad, 23, all, extant, copies, of, the, zhuangzi, ultimately, derive, from, a, version, that, was, further, edited, and, redacted, to, 33, chapters, by, guo, xiang, c, 300, ad, who, worked, from, the, material, previously, edited, by, liu, guo, plainly, stated, that, he, had, made, considerable, edits, to, the, outer, and, miscellaneous, chapters, in, an, attempt, to, preserve, zhuang, zhou, s, original, ideas, from, later, distortions, in, a, way, that, did, not, hesitate, to, impose, his, personal, understanding, and, philosophical, preferences, on, the, text, the, received, text, as, edited, by, guo, is, approximately, 63, 000, characters, long, around, two, thirds, the, attested, length, of, the, han, era, manuscript, while, none, are, known, to, exist, in, full, versions, of, the, text, unaffected, by, both, the, guo, and, liu, revisions, survived, into, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, with, the, existing, fragments, hinting, at, the, folkloric, nature, of, the, material, removed, by, guo, portions, of, the, zhuangzi, have, been, found, among, the, bamboo, slip, texts, discovered, in, tombs, dating, to, the, early, han, dynasty, particularly, at, the, shuanggudui, site, near, fuyang, in, anhui, and, the, mount, zhangjia, site, near, jingzhou, in, hubei, the, earlier, guodian, chu, slips, unearthed, near, jingmen, hubei, and, dating, to, the, warring, states, period, c, 300, bc, contain, what, appears, to, be, a, short, fragment, parallel, to, the, ransacking, coffers, chapter, no, 10, of, 33, the, dunhuang, manuscripts, discovered, during, the, early, 20th, century, by, the, hungarian, british, explorer, aurel, stein, and, the, french, sinologist, paul, pelliot, contain, numerous, zhuangzi, fragments, dating, to, the, early, tang, dynasty, stein, and, pelliot, took, most, of, the, manuscripts, back, to, europe, they, are, presently, held, at, the, british, library, and, the, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, the, zhuangzi, fragments, among, the, manuscripts, constitute, approximately, twelve, chapters, of, guo, xiang, s, edition, a, zhuangzi, manuscript, dating, to, the, muromachi, period, 1338, 1573, is, preserved, in, the, k, zan, ji, temple, in, kyoto, it, is, considered, one, of, japan, s, national, treasures, the, manuscript, has, seven, complete, selections, from, the, outer, and, miscellaneous, chapters, and, is, believed, to, be, a, close, copy, of, a, 7th, century, annotated, edition, written, by, the, chinese, taoist, master, cheng, xuanying, topics, neo, confucianism, new, confucianism, topics, the, zhuangzi, consists, of, anecdotes, allegories, parables, and, fables, that, are, often, humorous, or, irreverent, in, nature, most, of, these, are, fairly, short, and, simple, such, as, the, humans, lickety, and, split, drilling, seven, holes, into, the, primordial, wonton, no, 7, or, zhuang, zhou, being, discovered, sitting, and, drumming, on, a, basin, after, his, wife, dies, no, 18, a, few, are, longer, and, more, complex, like, the, story, of, lie, yukou, and, the, magus, or, the, account, of, the, yellow, emperor, s, music, both, no, 14, most, of, the, stories, within, the, zhuangzi, seem, to, have, been, invented, by, zhuang, zhou, himself, this, distinguishes, the, text, from, other, works, of, the, period, where, anecdotes, generally, only, appear, as, occasional, interjections, and, were, usually, drawn, from, existing, proverbs, or, legends, some, stories, are, completely, whimsical, such, as, the, strange, description, of, evolution, from, misty, spray, through, a, series, of, substances, and, insects, to, horses, and, humans, no, 18, while, a, few, other, passages, seem, to, be, sheer, playful, nonsense, which, read, like, lewis, carroll, s, jabberwocky, the, zhuangzi, is, full, of, quirky, and, fantastic, character, archetypes, such, as, mad, stammerer, fancypants, scholar, sir, plow, and, a, man, who, fancies, that, his, left, arm, will, turn, into, a, rooster, his, right, arm, will, turn, into, a, crossbow, and, his, buttocks, will, become, cartwheels, a, master, of, language, zhuang, zhou, sometimes, engages, in, logic, and, reasoning, but, then, turns, it, upside, down, or, carries, the, arguments, to, absurdity, to, demonstrate, the, limitations, of, human, knowledge, and, the, rational, world, sinologist, victor, h, mair, compares, zhuang, zhou, s, process, of, reasoning, to, socratic, dialogue, exemplified, by, the, debate, between, zhuang, zhou, and, fellow, philosopher, huizi, regarding, the, joy, of, fish, no, 17, mair, additionally, characterizes, huizi, s, paradoxes, near, the, end, of, the, book, as, being, strikingly, like, those, of, zeno, of, elea, the, most, famous, of, all, zhuangzi, stories, appears, at, the, end, of, the, second, chapter, on, the, equality, of, things, and, consists, of, a, dream, being, briefly, recalled, once, zhuang, zhou, dreamed, he, was, a, butterfly, a, butterfly, flitting, and, fluttering, about, happy, with, himself, and, doing, as, he, pleased, he, didn, t, know, that, he, was, zhuang, zhou, suddenly, he, woke, up, and, there, he, was, solid, and, unmistakable, zhuang, zhou, but, he, didn, t, know, if, he, was, zhuang, zhou, who, had, dreamt, he, was, a, butterfly, or, a, butterfly, dreaming, that, he, was, zhuang, zhou, between, zhuang, zhou, and, the, butterfly, there, must, be, some, distinction, this, is, called, the, transformation, of, things, the, image, of, zhuang, zhou, wondering, if, he, was, a, man, who, dreamed, of, being, a, butterfly, or, a, butterfly, dreaming, of, being, a, man, became, so, well, known, that, whole, dramas, have, been, written, on, its, theme, in, the, passage, zhuang, zhou, with, the, theme, of, transformation, illustrating, that, the, distinction, between, waking, and, dreaming, is, another, false, dichotomy, if, distinguishes, them, how, can, tell, if, is, now, dreaming, or, awake, another, well, known, passage, dubbed, the, death, of, wonton, illustrates, the, dangers, zhuang, zhou, saw, in, going, against, the, innate, nature, of, things, the, emperor, of, the, southern, seas, was, lickety, the, emperor, of, the, northern, sea, was, split, and, the, emperor, of, the, centre, was, wonton, lickety, and, split, often, met, each, other, in, the, land, of, wonton, and, wonton, treated, them, very, well, wanting, to, repay, wonton, s, kindness, lickety, and, split, said, all, people, have, seven, holes, for, seeing, hearing, eating, and, breathing, wonton, alone, lacks, them, let, s, try, boring, some, holes, for, him, so, every, day, they, bored, one, hole, and, on, the, seventh, day, wonton, died, zhuang, zhou, believed, that, the, greatest, of, all, human, happiness, could, be, achieved, through, a, higher, understanding, of, the, nature, of, things, and, that, in, order, to, develop, oneself, fully, one, needed, to, express, one, s, innate, ability, chapter, 17, contains, a, well, known, exchange, between, zhuang, zhou, and, huizi, featuring, a, heavy, use, of, wordplay, it, has, been, compared, to, a, socratic, dialogue, zhuangzi, and, huizi, were, enjoying, themselves, on, the, bridge, over, the, hao, river, zhuangzi, said, the, minnows, are, darting, about, free, and, easy, this, is, how, fish, are, happy, huizi, replied, you, are, not, a, fish, how, do, you, know, that, the, fish, are, happy, zhuangzi, said, you, are, not, i, how, do, you, know, that, i, do, not, know, that, the, fish, are, happy, huizi, said, i, am, not, you, to, be, sure, so, of, course, i, don, t, know, about, you, but, you, obviously, are, not, a, fish, so, the, case, is, complete, that, you, do, not, know, that, the, fish, are, happy, zhuangzi, said, let, s, go, back, to, the, beginning, of, this, you, said, how, do, you, know, that, the, fish, are, happy, but, in, asking, me, this, you, already, knew, that, i, know, it, i, know, it, right, here, above, the, hao, the, precise, point, zhuang, zhou, intends, to, make, in, the, debate, is, not, entirely, clear, the, text, appears, to, stress, that, knowing, a, thing, is, simply, a, state, of, mind, moreover, that, it, is, not, possible, to, determine, whether, knowing, has, any, objective, meaning, this, sequence, has, been, cited, as, an, example, of, zhuang, zhou, s, mastery, of, language, with, reason, subtly, employed, in, order, to, make, an, anti, rationalist, point, a, passage, in, chapter, 18, describes, zhuang, zhou, s, reaction, following, the, death, of, his, wife, expressing, a, view, of, death, as, something, not, to, be, feared, zhuangzi, s, wife, died, when, huizi, went, to, convey, his, condolences, he, found, zhuangzi, sitting, with, his, legs, sprawled, out, pounding, on, a, tub, and, singing, you, lived, with, her, she, brought, up, your, children, and, grew, old, said, huizi, it, should, be, enough, simply, not, to, weep, at, her, death, but, pounding, on, a, tub, and, singing, this, is, going, too, far, isn, t, it, zhuangzi, said, you, re, wrong, when, she, first, died, do, you, think, i, didn, t, grieve, like, anyone, else, but, i, looked, back, to, her, beginning, and, the, time, before, she, was, born, not, only, the, time, before, she, was, born, but, the, time, before, she, had, a, body, not, only, the, time, before, she, had, a, body, but, the, time, before, she, had, a, spirit, in, the, midst, of, the, jumble, of, wonder, and, mystery, a, change, took, place, and, she, had, a, spirit, another, change, and, she, had, a, body, another, change, and, she, was, born, now, there, s, been, another, change, and, she, s, dead, it, s, just, like, the, progression, of, the, four, seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter, now, she, s, going, to, lie, down, peacefully, in, a, vast, room, if, i, were, to, follow, after, her, bawling, and, sobbing, it, would, show, that, i, don, t, understand, anything, about, fate, so, i, stopped, zhuang, zhou, seems, to, have, viewed, death, as, a, natural, process, of, transformation, to, be, wholly, accepted, where, one, form, of, existence, is, given, up, and, another, assumed, in, the, second, chapter, zhuang, zhou, makes, the, point, that, for, all, humans, know, death, may, in, fact, be, better, than, life, how, do, i, know, that, loving, life, is, not, a, delusion, how, do, i, know, that, in, hating, death, i, am, not, like, a, man, who, having, left, home, in, his, youth, has, forgotten, the, way, back, his, writings, teach, that, the, wise, man, or, woman, accepts, death, with, equanimity, and, thereby, achieves, absolute, happiness, zhuang, zhou, s, own, death, is, depicted, in, chapter, 32, pointing, to, the, body, of, lore, that, grew, up, around, him, in, the, decades, following, his, death, it, serves, to, embody, and, reaffirm, the, ideas, attributed, to, zhuang, zhou, throughout, the, previous, chapters, when, master, zhuang, was, about, to, die, his, disciples, wanted, to, give, him, a, lavish, funeral, master, zhuang, said, i, take, heaven, and, earth, as, my, inner, and, outer, coffins, the, sun, and, moon, as, my, pair, of, jade, disks, the, stars, and, constellations, as, my, pearls, and, beads, the, ten, thousand, things, as, my, funerary, gifts, with, my, burial, complete, how, is, there, anything, left, unprepared, what, shall, be, added, to, it, the, disciples, said, we, are, afraid, that, the, crows, and, kites, will, eat, you, master, master, zhuang, said, above, ground, i, d, be, eaten, by, crows, and, kites, below, ground, i, d, be, eaten, by, mole, crickets, and, ants, you, rob, the, one, and, give, to, the, other, how, skewed, would, that, be, the, principles, and, attitudes, expressed, in, the, zhuangzi, form, the, core, of, philosophical, taoism, the, text, recommends, embracing, a, natural, spontaneity, in, order, to, better, align, one, s, inner, self, with, the, cosmic, way, it, also, encourages, keeping, a, distance, from, politics, and, social, obligations, accepting, death, as, a, natural, transformation, and, appreciating, things, otherwise, viewed, as, useless, or, lacking, purpose, the, text, implores, the, reader, to, reject, societal, norms, and, conventional, reasoning, the, other, major, philosophical, schools, in, ancient, china, including, confucianism, legalism, and, mohism, all, proposed, concrete, social, political, and, ethical, reforms, by, reforming, both, individuals, and, society, as, a, whole, thinkers, from, these, schools, sought, to, alleviate, human, suffering, and, ultimately, solve, the, world, s, problems, contrarily, zhuang, zhou, believed, the, key, to, true, happiness, was, to, free, oneself, from, worldly, impingements, through, a, principle, of, inaction, wu, wei, action, that, is, not, based, in, purposeful, striving, or, motivated, by, potential, gain, as, such, he, fundamentally, opposed, systems, that, sought, to, impose, order, on, individuals, the, zhuangzi, describes, the, universe, as, being, in, a, constant, state, of, spontaneous, change, which, is, not, driven, by, any, conscious, god, or, force, of, will, it, argues, that, humans, owing, to, their, exceptional, cognitive, ability, tend, to, create, artificial, distinctions, that, remove, them, from, the, natural, spontaneity, of, the, universe, these, include, those, of, good, versus, bad, large, versus, small, and, usefulness, versus, uselessness, it, proposes, that, humans, can, achieve, ultimate, happiness, by, rejecting, these, distinctions, and, living, spontaneously, in, kind, zhuang, zhou, often, uses, examples, of, craftsmen, and, artisans, to, illustrate, the, mindlessness, and, spontaneity, he, felt, should, characterize, human, action, as, burton, watson, described, the, skilled, woodcarver, the, skilled, butcher, the, skilled, swimmer, does, not, ponder, or, ratiocinate, on, the, course, of, action, he, should, take, his, skill, has, become, so, much, a, part, of, him, that, he, merely, acts, instinctively, and, spontaneously, and, without, knowing, why, achieves, success, the, term, wandering, y, u, is, used, throughout, the, zhuangzi, to, describe, how, an, enlightened, person, wanders, through, all, of, creation, enjoying, its, delights, without, ever, becoming, attached, to, any, one, part, of, it, the, nonhuman, characters, throughout, the, text, are, often, identified, as, being, useful, vehicles, for, metaphor, however, some, recent, scholarship, has, characterized, the, zhuangzi, as, being, anti, anthropocentric, or, even, animalistic, in, the, significance, it, ascribes, to, nonhuman, characters, when, viewed, through, this, lens, the, zhuangzi, questions, humanity, s, central, place, in, the, world, or, even, rejects, the, distinction, between, the, human, and, natural, worlds, altogether, political, positions, in, the, zhuangzi, generally, pertain, to, what, governments, should, not, do, rather, than, what, they, should, do, or, how, they, may, be, reformed, the, text, seems, to, oppose, formal, government, viewing, it, as, fundamentally, problematic, due, to, the, opposition, between, man, and, nature, zhuang, zhou, attempts, to, illustrate, that, as, soon, as, government, intervenes, in, natural, affairs, it, destroys, all, possibility, of, genuine, happiness, it, is, unclear, whether, zhuang, zhou, s, positions, amount, to, a, form, of, anarchism, western, scholars, have, noted, strong, anti, rationalist, themes, present, throughout, the, zhuangzi, whereas, reason, and, logic, as, understood, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, proved, foundational, to, the, entire, western, tradition, chinese, philosophers, often, preferred, to, rely, on, moral, persuasion, and, intuition, throughout, chinese, history, the, zhuangzi, significantly, informed, skepticism, towards, rationalism, in, the, text, zhuang, zhou, frequently, turns, logical, arguments, upside, down, in, order, to, satirize, and, discredit, them, however, according, to, mair, he, does, not, abandon, language, and, reason, altogether, but, only, wishe, to, point, out, that, over, dependence, on, them, could, limit, the, flexibility, of, thought, confucius, himself, is, a, recurring, character, in, the, text, sometimes, engaging, in, invented, debates, with, laozi, where, confucius, is, consistently, portrayed, as, being, the, less, authoritative, junior, figure, of, the, two, in, some, appearances, confucius, is, subjected, to, mockery, and, made, the, butt, of, many, jokes, while, in, others, he, is, treated, with, unambiguous, respect, intermittently, serving, as, the, mouthpiece, for, zhuang, zhou, s, ideas, the, zhuangzi, and, tao, te, ching, are, considered, to, be, the, two, fundamental, texts, in, the, taoist, tradition, it, is, accepted, that, some, version, of, the, tao, te, ching, influenced, the, composition, of, the, zhuangzi, however, the, two, works, are, distinct, in, their, perspectives, on, the, tao, itself, the, zhuangzi, uses, the, word, tao, less, frequently, than, the, tao, te, ching, with, the, former, often, using, heaven, in, places, the, latter, would, use, tao, while, zhuang, zhou, discusses, the, personal, process, of, following, the, tao, at, length, compared, to, laozi, he, articulates, little, about, the, nature, of, the, tao, itself, the, zhuangzi, s, only, direct, description, of, the, tao, is, contained, in, the, great, ancestral, teacher, no, 6, in, a, passage, demonstrably, adapted, from, chapter, 21, of, the, tao, te, ching, the, inner, chapters, and, the, tao, te, ching, agree, that, limitations, inherent, to, human, language, preclude, any, sufficient, description, of, the, tao, meanwhile, imperfect, descriptions, are, ubiquitous, throughout, both, texts, the, zhuangzi, is, the, most, influential, work, of, pure, literature, written, in, china, prior, to, its, unification, under, the, qin, dynasty, in, 221, bc, for, the, period, it, demonstrated, an, unparalleled, creativity, in, its, use, of, language, virtually, every, major, chinese, writer, or, poet, in, history, from, sima, xiangru, and, sima, qian, during, the, han, dynasty, ruan, ji, and, tao, yuanming, during, the, six, dynasties, li, bai, during, the, tang, dynasty, to, su, shi, and, lu, you, in, the, song, dynasty, were, deeply, imbued, with, the, ideas, and, artistry, of, the, zhuangzi, traces, of, the, zhuangzi, s, influence, in, late, warring, states, period, philosophical, texts, such, as, the, guanzi, han, feizi, huainanzi, and, l, shi, chunqiu, suggest, that, zhuang, zhou, s, intellectual, lineage, was, already, influential, in, the, states, of, qi, and, chu, by, the, 3rd, century, bc, during, the, qin, and, han, dynasties, with, their, respective, state, sponsored, legalist, and, confucian, ideologies, the, zhuangzi, does, not, seem, to, have, been, highly, regarded, one, exception, is, fu, on,
