americas, and, aboriginal, australians, though, most, believe, in, an, afterlife, or, spirit, world, a, belief, in, the, soul, s, rebirth, or, migration, metempsychosis, was, expressed, by, certain, ancient, greek, historical, figures, such, as, pythagoras, socrates, and, plato, although, the, majority, of, denominations, within, abrahamic, religions, do, not, believe, that, individuals, reincarnate, particular, groups, within, these, religions, do, refer, to, reincarnation, these, groups, include, the, mainstream, historical, and, contemporary, followers, of, cathars, alawites, hassidics, the, druze, kabbalistics, and, the, rosicrucians, recent, scholarly, research, has, explored, the, historical, relations, between, different, sects, and, their, beliefs, about, reincarnation, this, includes, the, views, of, neoplatonism, orphism, hermeticism, manichaenism, and, gnosticism, of, the, roman, era, as, well, as, those, in, indian, religions, in, recent, decades, many, europeans, and, north, americans, have, developed, an, interest, in, reincarnation, and, many, contemporary, works, mention, it, the, word, reincarnation, derives, from, a, latin, term, that,

by, culture, and, is, envisioned, to, be, in, the, form, of, a, newly, born, human, being, animal, plant, spirit, or, as, a, being, in, some, other, non, human, realm, of, existence, an, alternative, term, is, transmigration, implying, migration, from, one, life, body, to, another, the, term, has, been, used, by, modern, philosophers, such, as, kurt, g, del, and, has, entered, the, english,

ti, punarj, v, tu, punarbhava, gati, gati, common, in, buddhist, pali, text, nibbattin, upapatti, and, uppajjana, these, religions, believe, that, reincarnation, is, cyclic, and, an, endless, sa, s, ra, unless, one, gains, spiritual, insights, that, ends, this, cycle, leading, to, liberation, the, reincarnation, concept, is, considered, in, indian, religions, as, a, step, that, starts, each, cycle, of, aimless, drifting, wandering, or, mundane, existence, but, one, that, is, an, opportunity, to, seek, spiritual, liberation, through, ethical, living, and, a, variety, of, meditative, yogic, marga, or, other, spiritual, practices, they, consider, the, release, from, the, cycle, of, reincarnations, as, the, ultimate, spiritual, goal, and, call, the, liberation, by, terms, such, as, moksha,

the, celtic, druids, are, also, reported, to, have, taught, a, doctrine, of, reincarnation, the, concepts, of, the, cycle, of, birth, and, death, sa, s, ra, and, liberation, partly, derive, from, ascetic, traditions, that, arose, in, india, around, the, middle, of, the, first, millennium, bce, the, first, textual, references, to, the, idea, of, reincarnation, appear, in, the, rigveda, yajurveda, and, upanishads, of, the, late, vedic, period, c, 1100, c, 500, bce, predating, the, buddha, and, mahavira, though, no, direct, evidence, of, this, has, been, found, the, tribes, of, the, ganges, valley, or, the, dravidian, traditions, of, south, india, have, been, proposed, as, another, early, source, of, reincarnation, beliefs, the, idea, of, reincarnation, sa, s, ra, did, exist, in, the, early, vedic, religions, the, early, vedas, mention, the, doctrine, of, karma, and, rebirth, it, is, in, the, early, upanishads, which, are, pre, buddha, and, pre, mahavira, where, these, ideas, are, developed, and, described, in, a, general, way, detailed, descriptions, first, appear, around, the, mid, 1st, millennium, bce, in, diverse, traditions, including, buddhism, jainism, and, various, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, each, of, which, gave, unique, expression, to, the, general, principle, sangam, literature, connotes, the, ancient, tamil, literature, and, is, the, earliest, known,

scholar, the, most, acceptable, range, for, the, sangam, literature, is, 100, bce, to, 250, ce, based, on, the, linguistic, prosodic, and, quasi, historic, allusions, within, the, texts, and, the, colophons, there, are, several, mentions, of, rebirth, and, moksha, in, the, purananuru, the, text, explains, hindu, rituals, surrounding, death, such, as, making, riceballs, called, pinda, and, cremation, the, text, states, that, good, souls, get, a, place, in, indraloka, where, indra, welcomes, them, the, texts, of, ancient, jainism, that, have, survived, into, the, modern, era, are, post,

bodily, form, is, permanent, everyone, dies, and, reincarnates, further, liberation, kevalya, from, reincarnation, is, possible, however, through, removing, and, ending, karmic, accumulations, to, one, s, soul, from, the, early, stages, of, jainism, on, a, human, being, was, considered, the, highest, mortal, being, with, the, potential, to, achieve, liberation, particularly, through, asceticism, the, early, buddhist, texts, discuss, rebirth, as, part, of, the, doctrine, of, sa, s, ra, this, asserts, that, the, nature, of, existence, is, a, suffering, laden, cycle, of, life, death, and, rebirth, without, beginning, or, end, also, referred, to, as, the, wheel, of, existence, bhavacakra, it, is, often, mentioned, in, buddhist, texts, with, the, term, punarbhava, rebirth, re, becoming, liberation, from, this, cycle, of, existence, nirvana, is, the, foundation, and, the, most, important, purpose, of, buddhism, buddhist, texts, also, assert, that, an, enlightened, person, knows, his, previous, births, a, knowledge, achieved, through, high, levels, of, meditative, concentration, tibetan, buddhism, discusses, death, bardo, an, intermediate, state, and, rebirth, in, texts, such, as, the, tibetan, book, of, the, dead, while, nirvana, is, taught, as, the, ultimate, goal, in, the, theravadin, buddhism, and, is, essential, to, mahayana, buddhism, the, vast, majority, of, contemporary, lay, buddhists, focus, on, accumulating, good, karma, and, acquiring, merit, to, achieve, a, better, reincarnation, in, the, next, life, in, early, buddhist, traditions, sa, s, ra, cosmology, consisted, of, five, realms, through, which, the, wheel, of, existence, cycled, this, included, hells, niraya, hungry, ghosts, pretas, animals, tiryaka, humans, manushya, and, gods, devas, heavenly, in, latter, buddhist, traditions, this, list, grew, to, a, list, of, six, realms, of, rebirth, adding, demigods, asuras, the, earliest, layers, of, vedic, text, incorporate, the, concept, of, life, followed, by, an, afterlife, in, heaven, and, hell, based, on, cumulative, virtues, merit, or, vices, demerit, however, the, ancient, vedic, rishis, challenged, this, idea, of, afterlife, as, simplistic, because, people, do, not, live, equally, moral, or, immoral, lives, between, generally, virtuous, lives, some, are, more, virtuous, while, evil, too, has, degrees, and, the, texts, assert, that, it, would, be, unfair, for, people, with, varying, degrees, of, virtue, or, vices, to, end, up, in, heaven, or, hell, in, either, or, and, disproportionate, manner, irrespective, of, how, virtuous, or, vicious, their, lives, were, they, introduced, the, idea, of, an, afterlife, in, heaven, or, hell, in, proportion, to, one, s, merit, early, texts, of, hinduism, buddhism, and,

future, rebirths, for, example, all, three, discuss, various, virtues, sometimes, grouped, as, yamas, and, niyamas, such, as, non, violence, truthfulness, non, stealing, non, possessiveness, compassion, for, all, living, beings, charity, and, many, others, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, disagree, in, their, assumptions, and, theories, about, rebirth, hinduism, relies, on, its, foundational, belief, that, the, soul, self, exists, atman, or, att, while, buddhism, aserts, that, there, is, no, soul, no, self, anatta, or, anatman, hindu, traditions, consider, soul, to, be, the, unchanging, eternal, essence, of, a, living, being, which, journeys, through, reincarnations, until, it, attains, self, knowledge, buddhism, in, contrast, asserts, a, rebirth, theory, without, a, self, and, considers, realization, of, non, self, or, emptiness, as, nirvana, nibbana, the, reincarnation, doctrine, in, jainism, differs, from, those, in, buddhism, even, though, both, are, non, theistic, sramana, traditions, jainism, in, contrast, to, buddhism, accepts, the, foundational, assumption, that, soul, jiva, exists, and, asserts, that, this, soul, is, involved, in, the, rebirth, mechanism, furthermore, jainism, considers, asceticism, as, an, important, means, to, spiritual, liberation, that, ends, the, cycle, of, reincarnation, while, buddhism, does, not, early, greek, discussion, of, the, concept, dates, to, the, sixth, century, bce, an, early, greek, thinker, known, to, have, considered, rebirth, is, pherecydes, of, syros, fl, 540, bce, his, younger, contemporary, pythagoras, c, 570, c, 495, bce, its, first, famous, exponent, instituted, societies, for, its, diffusion, some, authorities, believe, that, pythagoras, was, pherecydes, pupil, others, that, pythagoras, took, up, the, idea, of, reincarnation, from, the, doctrine, of, orphism, a, thracian, religion, or, brought, the, teaching, from, india, plato, 428, 427, 348, 347, bce, presented, accounts, of, reincarnation, in, his, works, particularly, the, myth, of, er, where, plato, makes, socrates, tell, how, er, the, son, of, armenius, miraculously, returned, to, life, on, the, twelfth, day, after, death, and, recounted, the, secrets, of, the, other, world, there, are, myths, and, theories, to, the, same, effect, in, other, dialogues, in, the, chariot, allegory, of, the, phaedrus, in, the, meno, timaeus, and, laws, the, soul, once, separated, from, the, body, spends, an, indeterminate, amount, of, time, in, the, intelligible, realm, see, the, allegory, of, the, cave, in, the, republic, and, then, assumes, another, body, in, the, timaeus, plato, believes, that, the, soul, moves, from, body, to, body, without, any, distinct, reward, or, punishment, phase, between, lives, because, the, reincarnation, is, itself, a, punishment, or, reward, for, how, a, person, has, lived, in, phaedo, plato, has, his, teacher, socrates, prior, to, his, death, state, i, am, confident, that, there, truly, is, such, a, thing, as, living, again, and, that, the, living, spring, from, the, dead, however, xenophon, does, not, mention, socrates, as, believing, in, reincarnation, and, plato, may, have, systematized, socrates, thought, with, concepts, he, took, directly, from, pythagoreanism, or, orphism, recent, scholars, have, come, to, see, that, plato, has, multiple, reasons, for, the, belief, in, reincarnation, one, argument, concerns, the, theory, of, reincarnation, s, usefulness, for, explaining, why, non, human, animals, exist, they, are, former, humans, being, punished, for, their, vices, plato, gives, this, argument, at, the, end, of, the, timaeus, the, orphic, religion, which, taught, reincarnation, about, the, sixth, century, bce, produced, a, copious, literature, orpheus, its, legendary, founder, is, said, to, have, taught, that, the, immortal, soul, aspires, to, freedom, while, the, body, holds, it, prisoner, the, wheel, of, birth, revolves, the, soul, alternates, between, freedom, and, captivity, round, the, wide, circle, of, necessity, orpheus, proclaimed, the, need, of, the, grace, of, the, gods, dionysus, in, particular, and, of, self, purification, until, the, soul, has, completed, the, spiral, ascent, of, destiny, to, live, forever, an, association, between, pythagorean, philosophy, and, reincarnation, was, routinely, accepted, throughout, antiquity, as, pythagoras, also, taught, about, reincarnation, however, unlike, the, orphics, who, considered, metempsychosis, a, cycle, of, grief, that, could, be, escaped, by, attaining, liberation, from, it, pythagoras, seems, to, postulate, an, eternal, neutral, reincarnation, where, subsequent, lives, would, not, be, conditioned, by, any, action, done, in, the, previous, in, later, greek, literature, the, doctrine, is, mentioned, in, a, fragment, of, menander, and, satirized, by, lucian, in, roman, literature, it, is, found, as, early, as, ennius, who, in, a, lost, passage, of, his, annals, told, how, he, had, seen, homer, in, a, dream, who, had, assured, him, that, the, same, soul, which, had, animated, both, the, poets, had, once, belonged, to, a, peacock, persius, in, his, satires, vi, 9, laughs, at, this, it, is, referred, to, also, by, lucretius, and, horace, virgil, works, the, idea, into, his, account, of, the, underworld, in, the, sixth, book, of, the, aeneid, it, persists, down, to, the, late, classic, thinkers, plotinus, and, the, other, neoplatonists, in, the, hermetica, a, graeco, egyptian, series, of, writings, on, cosmology, and, spirituality, attributed, to, hermes, trismegistus, thoth, the, doctrine, of, reincarnation, is, central, in, the, first, century, bce, alexander, cornelius, polyhistor, wrote, the, pythagorean, doctrine, prevails, among, the, gauls, teaching, that, the, souls, of, men, are, immortal, and, that, after, a, fixed, number, of, years, they, will, enter, into, another, body, julius, caesar, recorded, that, the, druids, of, gaul, britain, and, ireland, had, metempsychosis, as, one, of, their, core, doctrines, the, principal, point, of, their, doctrine, is, that, the, soul, does, not, die, and, that, after, death, it, passes, from, one, body, into, another, the, main, object, of, all, education, is, in, their, opinion, to, imbue, their, scholars, with, a, firm, belief, in, the, indestructibility, of, the, human, soul, which, according, to, their, belief, merely, passes, at, death, from, one, tenement, to, another, for, by, such, doctrine, alone, they, say, which, robs, death, of, all, its, terrors, can, the, highest, form, of, human, courage, be, developed, diodorus, also, recorded, the, gaul, belief, that, human, souls, were, immortal, and, that, after, a, prescribed, number, of, years, they, would, commence, upon, a, new, life, in, another, body, he, added, that, gauls, had, the, custom, of, casting, letters, to, their, deceased, upon, the, funeral, pyres, through, which, the, dead, would, be, able, to, read, them, valerius, maximus, also, recounted, they, had, the, custom, of, lending, sums, of, money, to, each, other, which, would, be, repayable, in, the, next, world, this, was, mentioned, by, pomponius, mela, who, also, recorded, gauls, buried, or, burnt, with, them, things, they, would, need, in, a, next, life, to, the, point, some, would, jump, into, the, funeral, piles, of, their, relatives, in, order, to, cohabit, in, the, new, life, with, them, hippolytus, of, rome, believed, the, gauls, had, been, taught, the, doctrine, of, reincarnation, by, a, slave, of, pythagoras, named, zalmoxis, conversely, clement, of, alexandria, believed, pythagoras, himself, had, learned, it, from, the, celts, and, not, the, opposite, claiming, he, had, been, taught, by, galatian, gauls, hindu, priests, and, zoroastrians, however, author, t, d, kendrick, rejected, a, real, connection, between, pythagoras, and, the, celtic, idea, reincarnation, noting, their, beliefs, to, have, substantial, differences, and, any, contact, to, be, historically, unlikely, nonetheless, he, proposed, the, possibility, of, an, ancient, common, source, also, related, to, the, orphic, religion, and, thracian, systems, of, belief, surviving, texts, indicate, that, there, was, a, belief, in, rebirth, in, germanic, paganism, examples, include, figures, from, eddic, poetry, and, sagas, potentially, by, way, of, a, process, of, naming, and, or, through, the, family, line, scholars, have, discussed, the, implications, of, these, attestations, and, proposed, theories, regarding, belief, in, reincarnation, among, the, germanic, peoples, prior, to, christianization, and, potentially, to, some, extent, in, folk, belief, thereafter, the, belief, in, reincarnation, developed, among, jewish, mystics, in, the, medieval, world, among, whom, differing, explanations, were, given, of, the, afterlife, although, with, a, universal, belief, in, an, immortal, soul, it, was, explicitly, rejected, by, saadiah, gaon, today, reincarnation, is, an, esoteric, belief, within, many, streams, of, modern, judaism, kabbalah, teaches, a, belief, in, gilgul, transmigration, of, souls, and, hence, the, belief, in, reincarnation, is, universal, in, hasidic, judaism, which, regards, the, kabbalah, as, sacred, and, authoritative, and, is, also, sometimes, held, as, an, esoteric, belief, within, other, strains, of, orthodox, judaism, in, judaism, the, zohar, first, published, in, the, 13th, century, discusses, reincarnation, at, length, especially, in, the, torah, portion, balak, the, most, comprehensive, kabbalistic, work, on, reincarnation, shaar, hagilgulim, was, written, by, chaim, vital, based, on, the, teachings, of, his, mentor, the, 16th, century, kabbalist, isaac, luria, who, was, said, to, know, the, past, lives, of, each, person, through, his, semi, prophetic, abilities, the, 18th, century, lithuanian, master, scholar, and, kabbalist, elijah, of, vilna, known, as, the, vilna, gaon, authored, a, commentary, on, the, biblical, book, of, jonah, as, an, allegory, of, reincarnation, the, practice, of, conversion, to, judaism, is, sometimes, understood, within, orthodox, judaism, in, terms, of, reincarnation, according, to, this, school, of, thought, in, judaism, when, non, jews, are, drawn, to, judaism, it, is, because, they, had, been, jews, in, a, former, life, such, souls, may, wander, among, nations, through, multiple, lives, until, they, find, their, way, back, to, judaism, including, through, finding, themselves, born, in, a, gentile, family, with, a, lost, jewish, ancestor, there, is, an, extensive, literature, of, jewish, folk, and, traditional, stories, that, refer, to, reincarnation, reincarnationism, or, biblical, reincarnation, is, the, belief, that, certain, people, are, or, can, be, reincarnations, of, biblical, figures, such, as, jesus, christ, and, the, virgin, mary, some, christians, believe, that, certain, new, testament, figures, are, reincarnations, of, old, testament, figures, for, example, john, the, baptist, is, believed, by, some, to, be, a, reincarnation, of, the, prophet, elijah, and, a, few, take, this, further, by, suggesting, jesus, was, the, reincarnation, of, elijah, s, disciple, elisha, other, christians, believe, the, second, coming, of, jesus, would, be, fulfilled, by, reincarnation, sun, myung, moon, the, founder, of, the, unification, church, considered, himself, to, be, the, fulfillment, of, jesus, return, the, catholic, church, does, not, believe, in, reincarnation, which, it, regards, as, being, incompatible, with, death, nonetheless, the, leaders, of, certain, sects, in, the, church, have, taught, that, they, are, reincarnations, of, mary, for, example, marie, paule, gigu, re, of, the, army, of, mary, and, maria, franciszka, of, the, former, mariavites, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, excommunicated, the, army, of, mary, for, teaching, heresy, including, reincarnationism, several, gnostic, sects, professed, reincarnation, the, sethians, and, followers, of, valentinus, believed, in, it, the, followers, of, bardaisan, of, mesopotamia, a, sect, of, the, second, century, deemed, heretical, by, the, catholic, church, drew, upon, chaldean, astrology, to, which, bardaisan, s, son, harmonius, educated, in, athens, added, greek, ideas, including, a, sort, of, metempsychosis, another, such, teacher, was, basilides, 132, ce, ad, known, to, us, through, the, criticisms, of, irenaeus, and, the, work, of, clement, of, alexandria, see, also, neoplatonism, and, gnosticism, and, buddhism, and, gnosticism, in, the, third, christian, century, manichaeism, spread, both, east, and, west, from, babylonia, then, within, the, sassanid, empire, where, its, founder, mani, lived, about, 216, 276, manichaean, monasteries, existed, in, rome, in, 312, ad, noting, mani, s, early, travels, to, the, kushan, empire, and, other, buddhist, influences, in, manichaeism, richard, foltz, attributes, mani, s, teaching, of, reincarnation, to, buddhist, influence, however, the, inter, relation, of, manicheanism, orphism, gnosticism, and, neo, platonism, is, far, from, clear, taoist, documents, from, as, early, as, the, han, dynasty, claimed, that, lao, tzu, appeared, on, earth, as, different, persons, in, different, times, beginning, in, the, legendary, era, of, three, sovereigns, and, five, emperors, the, ca, third, century, bc, chuang, tzu, states, birth, is, not, a,

were, persecuted, as, heresies, through, the, establishment, of, the, inquisition, in, the, latin, west, these, included, the, cathar, paterene, or, albigensian, church, of, western, europe, the, paulician, movement, which, arose, in, armenia, and, the, bogomils, in, bulgaria, christian, sects, such, as, the, bogomils, and, the, cathars, who, professed, reincarnation, and, other, gnostic, beliefs, were, referred, to, as, manichaean, and, are, today, sometimes, described, by, scholars, as, neo, manichaean, as, there, is, no, known, manichaean, mythology, or, terminology, in, the, writings, of, these, groups, there, has, been, some, dispute, among, historians, as, to, whether, these, groups, truly, were, descendants, of, manichaeism, while, reincarnation, has, been, a, matter, of, faith, in, some, communities, from, an, early, date, it, has, also, frequently, been, argued, for, on, principle, as, plato, does, when, he, argues, that, the, number, of, souls, must, be, finite, because, souls, are, indestructible, benjamin, franklin, held, a, similar, view, sometimes, such, convictions, as, in, socrates, case, arise, from, a, more, general, personal, faith, at, other, times, from, anecdotal, evidence, such, as, plato, makes, socrates, offer, in, the, myth, of, er, during, the, renaissance, translations, of, plato, the, hermetica, and, other, works, fostered, new, european, interest, in, reincarnation, marsilio, ficino, argued, that, plato, s, references, to, reincarnation, were, intended, allegorically, shakespeare, alluded, to, the, doctrine, of, reincarnation, but, giordano, bruno, was, burned, at, the, stake, by, authorities, after, being, found, guilty, of, heresy, by, the, roman, inquisition, for, his, teachings, but, the, greek, philosophical, works, remained, available, and, particularly, in, north, europe, were, discussed, by, groups, such, as, the, cambridge, platonists, emanuel, swedenborg, believed, that, we, leave, the, physical, world, once, but, then, go, through, several, lives, in, the, spiritual, world, a, kind, of, hybrid, of, christian, tradition, and, the, popular, view, of, reincarnation, by, the, 19th, century, the, philosophers, schopenhauer, and, nietzsche, could, access, the, indian, scriptures, for, discussion, of, the, doctrine, of, reincarnation, which, recommended, itself, to, the, american, transcendentalists, henry, david, thoreau, walt, whitman, and, ralph, waldo, emerson, and, was, adapted, by, francis, bowen, into, christian, metempsychosis, by, the, early, 20th, century, interest, in, reincarnation, had, been, introduced, into, the, nascent, discipline, of, psychology, largely, due, to, the, influence, of, william, james, who, raised, aspects, of, the, philosophy, of, mind, comparative, religion, the, psychology, of, religious, experience, and, the, nature, of, empiricism, james, was, influential, in, the, founding, of, the, american, society, for, psychical, research, aspr, in, new, york, city, in, 1885, three, years, after, the, british, society, for, psychical, research, spr, was, inaugurated, in, london, leading, to, systematic, critical, investigation, of, paranormal, phenomena, famous, world, war, ii, american, general, george, patton, was, a, strong, believer, in, reincarnation, believing, among, other, things, he, was, a, reincarnation, of, the, carthaginian, general, hannibal, at, this, time, popular, awareness, of, the, idea, of, reincarnation, was, boosted, by, the, theosophical, society, s, dissemination, of, systematised, and, universalised, indian, concepts, and, also, by, the, influence, of, magical, societies, like, the, golden, dawn, notable, personalities, like, annie, besant, w, b, yeats, and, dion, fortune, made, the, subject, almost, as, familiar, an, element, of, the, popular, culture, of, the, west, as, of, the, east, by, 1924, the, subject, could, be, satirised, in, popular, children, s, books, humorist, don, marquis, created, a, fictional, cat, named, mehitabel, who, claimed, to, be, a, reincarnation, of, queen, cleopatra, th, odore, flournoy, was, among, the, first, to, study, a, claim, of, past, life, recall, in, the, course, of, his, investigation, of, the, medium, h, l, ne, smith, published, in, 1900, in, which, he, defined, the, possibility, of, cryptomnesia, in, such, accounts, carl, gustav, jung, like, flournoy, based, in, switzerland, also, emulated, him, in, his, thesis, based, on, a, study, of, cryptomnesia, in, psychism, later, jung, would, emphasise, the, importance, of, the, persistence, of, memory, and, ego, in, psychological, study, of, reincarnation, this, concept, of, rebirth, necessarily, implies, the, continuity, of, personality, that, one, is, able, at, least, potentially, to, remember, that, one, has, lived, through, previous, existences, and, that, these, existences, were, one, s, own, hypnosis, used, in, psychoanalysis, for, retrieving, forgotten, memories, was, eventually, tried, as, a, means, of, studying, the, phenomenon, of, past, life, recall, more, recently, many, people, in, the, west, have, developed, an, interest, in, and, acceptance, of, reincarnation, many, new, religious, movements, include, reincarnation, among, their, beliefs, e, g, modern, neopagans, spiritism, astara, dianetics, and, scientology, many, esoteric, philosophies, also, include, reincarnation, e, g, theosophy, anthroposophy, kabbalah, and, gnostic, and, esoteric, christianity, such, as, the, works, of, martinus, thomsen, demographic, survey, data, from, 1999, to, 2002, shows, a, significant, minority, of, people, from, europe, 22, and, america, 20, believe, in, the, existence, of, life, before, birth, and, after, death, leading, to, a, physical, rebirth, the, belief, in, reincarnation, is, particularly, high, in, the, baltic, countries, with, lithuania, having, the, highest, figure, for, the, whole, of, europe, 44, while, the, lowest, figure, is, in, east, germany, 12, a, quarter, of, u, s, christians, including, 10, of, all, born, again, christians, embrace, the, idea, academic, psychiatrist, ian, stevenson, reported, that, belief, in, reincarnation, is, held, with, variations, in, details, by, adherents, of, almost, all, major, religions, except, christianity, and, islam, in, addition, between, 20, and, 30, percent, of, persons, in, western, countries, who, may, be, nominal, christians, also, believe, in, reincarnation, one, 1999, study, by, walter, and, waterhouse, reviewed, the, previous, data, on, the, level, of, reincarnation, belief, and, performed, a, set, of, thirty, in, depth, interviews, in, britain, among, people, who, did, not, belong, to, a, religion, advocating, reincarnation, the, authors, reported, that, surveys, have, found, about, one, fifth, to, one, quarter, of, europeans, have, some, level, of, belief, in, reincarnation, with, similar, results, found, in, the, usa, in, the, interviewed, group, the, belief, in, the, existence, of, this, phenomenon, appeared, independent, of, their, age, or, the, type, of, religion, that, these, people, belonged, to, with, most, being, christians, the, beliefs, of, this, group, also, did, not, appear, to, contain, any, more, than, usual, of, new, age, ideas, broadly, defined, and, the, authors, interpreted, their, ideas, on, reincarnation, as, one, way, of, tackling, issues, of, suffering, but, noted, that, this, seemed, to, have, little, effect, on, their, private, lives, waterhouse, also, published, a, detailed, discussion, of, beliefs, expressed, in, the, interviews, she, noted, that, although, most, people, hold, their, belief, in, reincarnation, quite, lightly, and, were, unclear, on, the, details, of, their, ideas, personal, experiences, such, as, past, life, memories, and, near, death, experiences, had, influenced, most, believers, although, only, a, few, had, direct, experience, of, these, phenomena, waterhouse, analyzed, the, influences, of, second, hand, accounts, of, reincarnation, writing, that, most, of, the, people, in, the, survey, had, heard, other, people, s, accounts, of, past, lives, from, regression, hypnosis, and, dreams, and, found, these, fascinating, feeling, that, there, must, be, something, in, it, if, other, people, were, having, such, experiences, other, influential, contemporary, figures, that, have, written, on, reincarnation, include, alice, ann, bailey, one, of, the, first, writers, to, use, the, terms, new, age, and, age, of, aquarius, torkom, saraydarian, an, armenian, american, musician, and, religious, author, dolores, cannon, atul, gawande, michael, newton, bruce, greyson, raymond, moody, and, unity, church, founder, charles, fillmore, neale, donald, walsch, an, american, author, of, the, series, conversations, with, god, clcaims, that, he, has, reincarnated, more, than, 600, times, the, indian, spiritual, teacher, meher, baba, who, had, significant, following, in, the, west, taught, that, reincarnation, followed, from, human, desire, and, ceased, once, a, person, was, freed, from, desire, according, to, various, buddhist, scriptures, gautama, buddha, believed, in, the, existence, of, an, afterlife, in, another, world, and, in, reincarnation, since, there, actually, is, another, world, any, world, other, than, the, present, human, one, i, e, different, rebirth, realms, one, who, holds, the, view, there, is, no, other, world, has, wrong, view, the, buddha, also, asserted, that, karma, influences, rebirth, and, that, the, cycles, of, repeated, births, and, deaths, are, endless, before, the, birth, of, buddha, materialistic, school, such, as, charvaka, posited, that, death, is, the, end, there, is, no, afterlife, no, soul, no, rebirth, no, karma, and, they, described, death, to, be, a, state, where, a, living, being, is, completely, annihilated, dissolved, buddha, rejected, this, theory, adopted, the, alternative, existing, theories, on, rebirth, criticizing, the, materialistic, schools, that, denied, rebirth, and, karma, states, damien, keown, such, beliefs, are, inappropriate, and, dangerous, stated, buddha, because, such, annihilationism, views, encourage, moral, irresponsibility, and, material, hedonism, he, tied, moral, responsibility, to, rebirth, the, buddha, introduced, the, concept, of, anatt, which, asserts, that, there, is, no, permanent, self, soul, major, contemporary, buddhist, traditions, such, as, theravada, mahayana, and, vajrayana, traditions, accept, the, teachings, of, buddha, these, teachings, assert, there, is, rebirth, there, is, no, permanent, self, and, no, irreducible, tman, soul, moving, from, life, to, another, and, tying, these, lives, together, there, is, impermanence, that, all, compounded, things, such, as, living, beings, are, aggregates, dissolve, at, death, but, every, being, reincarnates, the, rebirth, cycles, continue, endlessly, states, buddhism, and, it, is, a, source, of, duhkha, suffering, pain, but, this, reincarnation, and, duhkha, cycle, can, be, stopped, through, nirvana, the, anatt, doctrine, of, buddhism, is, a, contrast, to, hinduism, the, latter, asserting, that, soul, exists, it, is, involved, in, rebirth, and, it, is, through, this, soul, that, everything, is, connected, different, traditions, within, buddhism, have, offered, different, theories, on, what, reincarnates, and, how, reincarnation, happens, one, theory, suggests, that, it, occurs, through, consciousness, sanskrit, vij, na, pali, samvattanika, vi, ana, or, stream, of, consciousness, sanskrit, citta, sant, na, vij, na, srot, m, or, vij, na, sant, na, pali, vi, ana, sotam, upon, death, which, reincarnates, into, a, new, aggregation, this, process, states, this, theory, is, similar, to, the, flame, of, a, dying, candle, lighting, up, another, the, consciousness, in, the, newly, born, being, is, neither, identical, to, nor, entirely, different, from, that, in, the, deceased, but, the, two, form, a, causal, continuum, or, stream, in, this, buddhist, theory, transmigration, is, influenced, by, a, being, s, past, karma, pali, kamma, the, root, cause, of, rebirth, states, buddhism, is, the, abiding, of, consciousness, in, ignorance, sanskrit, avidya, pali, avijja, about, the, nature, of, reality, and, when, this, ignorance, is, uprooted, rebirth, ceases, buddhist, traditions, also, vary, in, their, mechanistic, details, on, rebirth, most, theravada, buddhists, assert, that, rebirth, is, immediate, while, the, tibetan, and, most, chinese, and, japanese, schools, hold, to, the, notion, of, a, bardo, intermediate, state, that, can, last, up, to, 49, days, the, bardo, rebirth, concept, of, tibetan, buddhism, originally, developed, in, india, but, spread, to, tibet, and, other, buddhist, countries, and, involves, 42, peaceful, deities, and, 58, wrathful, deities, these, ideas, led, to, maps, on, karma, and, what, form, of, rebirth, one, takes, after, death, discussed, in, texts, such, as, the, tibetan, book, of, the, dead, the, major, buddhist, traditions, accept, that, the, reincarnation, of, a, being, depends, on, the, past, karma, and, merit, demerit, accumulated, and, that, there, are, six, realms, of, existence, in, which, the, rebirth, may, occur, after, each, death, within, japanese, zen, reincarnation, is, accepted, by, some, but, rejected, by, others, a, distinction, can, be, drawn, between, folk, zen, as, in, the, zen, practiced, by, devotional, lay, people, and, philosophical, zen, folk, zen, generally, accepts, the, various, supernatural, elements, of, buddhism, such, as, rebirth, philosophical, zen, however, places, more, emphasis, on, the, present, moment, some, schools, conclude, that, karma, continues, to, exist, and, adhere, to, the, person, until, it, works, out, its, consequences, for, the, sautrantika, school, each, act, perfumes, the, individual, or, plants, a, seed, that, later, germinates, tibetan, buddhism, stresses, the, state, of, mind, at, the, time, of, death, to, die, with, a, peaceful, mind, will, stimulate, a, virtuous, seed, and, a, fortunate, rebirth, a, disturbed, mind, will, stimulate, a, non, virtuous, seed, and, an, unfortunate, rebirth, in, a, survey, by, the, pew, forum, in, 2009, 22, of, american, christians, expressed, a, belief, in, reincarnation, and, in, a, 1981, survey, 31, of, regular, churchgoing, european, catholics, expressed, a, belief, in, reincarnation, some, christian, theologians, interpret, certain, biblical, passages, as, referring, to, reincarnation, these, passages, include, the, questioning, of, jesus, as, to, whether, he, is, elijah, john, the, baptist, jeremiah, or, another, prophet, matthew, 16, 13, 15, and, john, 1, 21, 22, and, less, clearly, while, elijah, was, said, not, to, have, died, but, to, have, been, taken, up, to, heaven, john, the, baptist, being, asked, if, he, is, not, elijah, john, 1, 25, geddes, macgregor, an, episcopalian, priest, and, professor, of, philosophy, has, made, a, case, for, the, compatibility, of, christian, doctrine, and, reincarnation, the, catholic, church, and, theologians, such, as, norman, geisler, argue, that, reincarnation, is, unorthodox, and, reject, the, reincarnationist, interpretation, of, texts, about, john, the, baptist, and, biblical, texts, used, to, defend, this, belief, there, is, evidence, that, origen, a, church, father, in, early, christian, times, taught, reincarnation, in, his, lifetime, but, that, when, his, works, were, translated, into, latin, these, references, were, concealed, one, of, the, epistles, written, by, st, jerome, to, avitus, letter, 124, ad, avitum, epistula, cxxiv, which, asserts, that, origen, s, on, the, first, principles, latin, de, principiis, greek, was, mistranscribed, about, ten, years, ago, that, saintly, man, pammachius, sent, me, a, copy, of, a, certain, person, s, rendering, or, rather, misrendering, of, origen, s, first, principles, with, a, request, that, in, a, latin, version, i, should, give, the, true, sense, of, the, greek, and, should, set, down, the, writer, s, words, for, good, or, for, evil, without, bias, in, either, direction, when, i, did, as, he, wished, and, sent, him, the, book, he, was, shocked, to, read, it, and, locked, it, up, in, his, desk, lest, being, circulated, it, might, wound, the, souls, of, many, under, the, impression, that, origen, was, a, heretic, like, arius, st, jerome, criticizes, ideas, described, in, on, the, first, principles, further, in, to, avitus, letter, 124, st, jerome, writes, about, convincing, proof, that, origen, teaches, reincarnation, in, the, original, version, of, the, book, the, following, passage, is, a, convincing, proof, that, he, holds, the, transmigration, of, the, souls, and, annihilation, of, bodies, if, it, can, be, shown, that, an, incorporeal, and, reasonable, being, has, life, in, itself, independently, of, the, body, and, that, it, is, worse, off, in, the, body, than, out, of, it, then, beyond, a, doubt, bodies, are, only, of, secondary, importance, and, arise, from, time, to, time, to, meet, the, varying, conditions, of, reasonable, creatures, those, who, require, bodies, are, clothed, with, them, and, contrariwise, when, fallen, souls, have, lifted, themselves, up, to, better, things, their, bodies, are, once, more, annihilated, they, are, thus, ever, vanishing, and, ever, reappearing, the, original, text, of, on, first, principles, has, almost, completely, disappeared, it, remains, extant, as, de, principiis, in, fragments, faithfully, translated, into, latin, by, st, jerome, and, in, the, not, very, reliable, latin, translation, of, rufinus, however, origen, s, supposed, belief, in, reincarnation, is, controversial, christian, scholar, dan, r, schlesinger, has, written, an, extensive, monograph, in, which, he, argues, that, origen, never, taught, reincarnation, reincarnation, was, taught, by, several, gnostics, such, as, marcion, of, sinope, belief, in, reincarnation, was, rejected, by, several, church, fathers, including, augustine, of, hippo, in, the, city, of, god, reincarnation, is, a, paramount, tenet, in, the, druze, faith, there, is, an, eternal, duality, of, the, body, and, the, soul, and, it, is, impossible, for, the, soul, to, exist, without, the, body, therefore, reincarnations, occur, instantly, at, one, s, death, while, in, the, hindu, and, buddhist, belief, system, a, soul, can, be, transmitted, to, any, living, creature, in, the, druze, belief, system, this, is, not, possible, and, a, human, soul, will, only, transfer, to, a, human, body, furthermore, souls, cannot, be, divided, into, different, or, separate, parts, and, the, number, of, souls, existing, is, finite, few, druzes, are, able, to, recall, their, past, but, if, they, are, able, to, they, are, called, a, nateq, typically, souls, who, have, died, violent, deaths, in, their, previous, incarnation, will, be, able, to, recall, memories, since, death, is, seen, as, a, quick, transient, state, mourning, is, discouraged, unlike, other, abrahamic, faiths, heaven, and, hell, are, spiritual, heaven, is, the, ultimate, happiness, received, when, soul, escapes, the, cycle, of, rebirths, and, reunites, with, the, creator, while, hell, is, conceptualized, as, the, bitterness, of, being, unable, to, reunite, with, the, creator, and, escape, from, the, cycle, of, rebirth, traditional, hindu, traditions, assert, that, the, body, dies, but, not, the, soul, which, they, believe, to, be, eternal, indestructible, and, blissful, everything, and, all, existence, is, believed, to, be, connected, and, cyclical, in, many, hinduism, sects, all, living, beings, composed, of, two, things, the, soul, and, the, body, or, matter, in, hindu, belief, tman, does, not, change, and, cannot, change, by, its, innate, nature, current, karma, impacts, the, future, circumstances, in, this, life, as, well, as, the, future, forms, and, realms, of, lives, good, intent, and, actions, lead, to, good, future, bad, intent, and, actions, lead, to, bad, future, impacting, how, one, reincarnates, there, is, no, permanent, heaven, or, hell, in, most, hinduism, sects, in, the, afterlife, based, on, one, s, karma, the, soul, is, reborn, as, another, being, in, heaven, hell, or, a, living, being, on, earth, human, animal, gods, too, die, once, their, past, karmic, merit, runs, out, as, do, those, in, hell, and, they, return, getting, another, chance, on, earth, this, reincarnation, continues, endlessly, in, cycles, until, one, embarks, on, a, spiritual, pursuit, realizes, self, knowledge, and, thereby, gains, mok, a, the, final, release, out, of, the, reincarnation, cycles, this, release, is, believed, to, be, a, state, of, utter, bliss, which, hindu, traditions, believe, is, either, related, or, identical, to, brahman, the, unchanging, reality, that, existed, before, the, creation, of, universe, continues, to, exist, and, shall, exist, after, the, universe, ends, the, upanishads, part, of, the, scriptures, of, the, hindu, traditions, primarily, focus, on, the, liberation, from, reincarnation, the, bhagavad, gita, discusses, various, paths, to, liberation, the, upanishads, states, harold, coward, offer, a, very, optimistic, view, regarding, the, perfectibility, of, human, nature, and, the, goal, of, human, effort, in, these, texts, is, a, continuous, journey, to, self, perfection, and, self, knowledge, so, as, to, end, sa, s, ra, the, endless, cycle, of, rebirth, and, redeath, the, aim, of, spiritual, quest, in, the, upanishadic, traditions, is, find, the, true, self, within, and, to, know, one, s, soul, a, state, that, they, assert, leads, to, blissful, state, of, freedom, moksha, the, bhagavad, gita, states, just, as, in, the, body, childhood, adulthood, and, old, age, happen, to, an, embodied, being, so, also, he, the, embodied, being, acquires, another, body, the, wise, one, is, not, deluded, about, this, 2, 13, as, after, casting, away, worn, out, garments, a, man, later, takes, new, ones, so, after, casting, away, worn, out, bodies, the, embodied, self, encounters, other, new, ones, 2, 22, when, an, embodied, being, transcends, these, three, qualities, which, are, the, source, of, the, body, released, from, birth, death, old, age, and, pain, he, attains, immortality, 14, 20, there, are, internal, differences, within, hindu, traditions, on, reincarnation, and, the, state, of, moksha, for, example, the, dualistic, devotional, traditions, such, as, madhvacharya, s, dvaita, vedanta, tradition, of, hinduism, champion, a, theistic, premise, assert, that, human, soul, and, brahman, are, different, loving, devotion, to, brahman, god, vishnu, in, madhvacharya, s, theology, is, the, means, to, release, from, samsara, it, is, the, grace, of, god, which, leads, to, moksha, and, spiritual, liberation, is, achievable, only, in, after, life, videhamukti, the, non, dualistic, traditions, such, as, adi, shankara, s, advaita, vedanta, tradition, of, hinduism, champion, a, monistic, premise, asserting, that, the, individual, human, soul, and, brahman, are, identical, only, ignorance, impulsiveness, and, inertia, leads, to, suffering, through, sa, s, ra, in, reality, there, are, no, dualities, meditation, and, self, knowledge, is, the, path, to, liberation, the, realization, that, one, s, soul, is, identical, to, brahman, is, moksha, and, spiritual, liberation, is, achievable, in, this, life, jivanmukti, twentieth, century, indian, philosopher, sri, aurobindo, said, that, rebirth, was, the, mechanism, of, evolution, plants, are, reborn, as, animals, which, are, reborn, as, humans, gaining, intelligence, each, time, he, said, that, this, progression, was, irreversible, and, that, a, human, cannot, be, reborn, as, an, animal, most, islamic, schools, of, thought, reject, any, idea, of, reincarnation, of, living, beings, it, teaches, a, linear, concept, of, life, wherein, a, human, being, has, only, one, life, and, upon, death, he, or, she, is, judged, by, god, then, rewarded, in, heaven, or, punished, in, hell, islam, teaches, final, resurrection, and, judgement, day, but, there, is, no, prospect, for, the, reincarnation, of, a, human, being, into, a, different, body, or, being, during, the, early, history, of, islam, some, of, the, caliphs, persecuted, all, reincarnation, believing, people, such, as, manichaeism, to, the, point, of, extinction, in, mesopotamia, and, persia, modern, day, iraq, and, iran, however, some, muslim, minority, sects, such, as, those, found, among, sufis, and, some, muslims, in, south, asia, and, indonesia, have, retained, their, pre, islamic, hindu, and, buddhist, beliefs, in, reincarnation, for, instance, historically, south, asian, isma, ilis, performed, chantas, yearly, one, of, which, is, for, seeking, forgiveness, of, sins, committed, in, past, lives, the, idea, of, reincarnation, is, accepted, by, a, few, heterodox, sects, particularly, of, the, ghulat, alawites, hold, that, they, were, originally, stars, or, divine, lights, that, were, cast, out, of, heaven, through, disobedience, and, must, undergo, repeated, reincarnation, or, metempsychosis, before, returning, to, heaven, they, can, be, reincarnated, as, christians, or, others, through, sin, and, as, animals, if, they, become, infidels, in, jainism, the, reincarnation, doctrine, along, with, its, theories, of, sa, s, ra, and, karma, are, central, to, its, theological, foundations, as, evidenced, by, the, extensive, literature, on, it, in, the, major, sects, of, jainism, and, their, pioneering, ideas, on, these, topics, from, the, earliest, times, of, the, jaina, tradition, reincarnation, in, contemporary, jainism, traditions, is, the, belief, that, the, worldly, life, is, characterized, by, continuous, rebirths, and, suffering, in, various, realms, of, existence, karma, forms, a, central, and, fundamental, part, of, jain, faith, being, intricately, connected, to, other, of, its, philosophical, concepts, like, transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non, violence, ahi, s, and, non, attachment, among, others, actions, are, seen, to, have, consequences, some, immediate, some, delayed, even, into, future, incarnations, so, the, doctrine, of, karma, is, not, considered, simply, in, relation, to, one, life, time, but, also, in, relation, to, both, future, incarnations, and, past, lives, uttar, dhyayana, s, tra, 3, 3, 4, states, the, j, va, or, the, soul, is, sometimes, born, in, the, world, of, gods, sometimes, in, hell, sometimes, it, acquires, the, body, of, a, demon, all, this, happens, on, account, of, its, karma, this, j, va, sometimes, takes, birth, as, a, worm, as, an, insect, or, as, an, ant, the, text, further, states, 32, 7, karma, is, the, root, of, birth, and, death, the, souls, bound, by, karma, go, round, and, round, in, the, cycle, of, existence, actions, and, emotions, in, the, current, lifetime, affect, future, incarnations, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, particular, karma, for, example, a, good, and, virtuous, life, indicates, a, latent, desire, to, experience, good, and, virtuous, themes, of, life, therefore, such, a, person,

century, possibly, influenced, by, muslim, mystics, gaining, acceptance, among, karaites, and, jewish, dissenters, it, was, first, mentioned, in, jewish, literature, by, saadia, gaon, who, criticized, it, however, it, remained, a, minority, belief, facing, little, resistance, until, the, spread, of, kabbalah, in, the, 12th, century, the, book, of, clarity, sefer, ha, bahir, of, this, period, introduced, concepts, such, as, the, transmigration, of, souls, strengthening, the, foundation, of, kabbalah, with, mystical, symbolism, kabbalah, also, teaches, that, the, soul, of, moses, is, reincarnated, in, every, generation, this, teaching, found, more, significant, ground, in, kabbalistic, circles, in, provence, and, spain, despite, not, being, widely, accepted, in, orthodox, judaism, the, doctrine, of, reincarnation, attracted, some, modern, jews, involved, in, mysticism, hasidic, judaism, and, followers, of, kabbalah, remained, firm, in, their, belief, in, the, transmigration, of, souls, other, branches, of, judaism, such, as, reform, and, conservative, do, not, teach, it, the, 16th, century, mystical, renaissance, in, communal, safed, replaced, scholastic, rationalism, as,

ideas, that, developed, during, the, devotional, bhakti, movement, particularly, within, some, vaishnava, traditions, which, define, liberation, as, a, state, of, union, with, god, attained, through, the, grace, of, god, the, doctrines, of, sikhism, teach, that, the, soul, exists, and, is, passed, from, one, body, to, another, in, endless, cycles, of, sa, s, ra, until, liberation, from, the,

on, the, belief, that, if, a, recently, deceased, person, s, destiny, in, that, life, remained, unfulfilled, the, deceased, cannot, join, the, ancestors, and, therefore, must, roam, the, world, following, death, an, akudaaya, returns, to, their, previous, existence, by, reappearing, in, the, same, physical, form, however, the, new, existence, will, be, lived, in, a, different, physical,

society, draws, much, of, its, inspiration, from, india, in, the, theosophical, world, view, reincarnation, is, the, vast, rhythmic, process, by, which, the, soul, the, part, of, a, person, which, belongs, to, the, formless, non, material, and, timeless, worlds, unfolds, its, spiritual, powers, in, the, world, and, comes, to, know, itself, it, descends, from, sublime, free, spiritual, realms, and, gathers, experience, through, its, effort, to, express, itself, in, the, world, afterwards, there, is, a, withdrawal, from, the, physical, plane, to, successively, higher, levels, of, reality, in, death, a, purification, and, assimilation, of, the, past, life, having, cast, off, all, instruments, of, personal, experience, it, stands, again, in, its, spiritual, and, formless, nature, ready, to, begin, its, next, rhythmic, manifestation, every, lifetime, bringing, it, closer, to, complete, self, knowledge, and, self, expression, however, it, may, attract, old, mental, emotional, and,

genes, upbringing, or, biographical, vicissitudes, steiner, relates, that, a, large, estate, in, north, eastern, france, was, held, during, the, early, middle, ages, by, a, martial, feudal, lord, during, a, military, campaign, this, estate, was, captured, by, a, rival, the, previous, owner, had, no, means, of, retaliating, and, was, forced, to, see, his, property, lost, to, an, enemy, he, was, filled, with, a, smoldering, resentment, towards, the, propertied, classes, not, only, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, in, the, middle, ages, but, also, in, a, much, later, incarnation, as, karl,

century, integrated, the, concepts, of, karma, and, reincarnation, into, the, practice, of, western, astrology, notable, astrologers, who, advanced, this, development, included, alan, leo, charles, e, o, carter, marc, edmund, jones, and, dane, rudhyar, a, new, synthesis, of, east, and, west, resulted, as, hindu, and, buddhist, concepts, of, reincarnation, were, fused, with, western, astrology, s, deep, roots, in, hermeticism, and, neoplatonism, in, the, case, of, rudhyar, this, synthesis, was, enhanced, with, the, addition, of, jungian, depth, psychology, this, dynamic, integration, of, astrology, reincarnation, and, depth, psychology, has, continued, into, the, modern, era, with, the, work, of, astrologers, steven, forrest, and, jeffrey, wolf, green, their, respective, schools, of, evolutionary, astrology, are, based, on, an, acceptance, of, the, fact, that, human, beings, incarnate, in, a, succession, of, lifetimes, past, reincarnation, usually, termed, past, lives, is, a, key, part, of, the, principles, and, practices, of, the, church, of, scientology, scientologists, believe, that, the, human, individual, is, actually, a, thetan, an, immortal, spiritual, entity, that, has, fallen, into, a, degraded, state, as, a, result, of, past, life, experiences, scientology, auditing, is, intended, to, free, the, person, of, these, past, life, traumas, and, recover, past, life, memory, leading, to, a, higher, state, of, spiritual, awareness, this, idea, is, echoed, in, their, highest, fraternal, religious, order, sea, org, whose, motto, is, revenimus, we, come, back, and, whose, members, sign, a, billion, year, contract, as, a, sign, of, commitment, to, that, ideal, l, ron, hubbard, the, founder, of, scientology, does, not, use, the, word, reincarnation, to, describe, its, beliefs, noting, that, the, common, definition, of, reincarnation, has, been, altered, from, its, original, meaning, the, word, has, come, to, mean, to, be, born, again, in, different, life, forms, whereas, its, actual, definition, is, to, be, born, again, into, the, flesh, of, another, body, scientology, ascribes, to, this, latter, original, definition, of, reincarnation, the, first, writings, in, scientology, regarding, past, lives, date, from, around, 1951, and, slightly, earlier, in, 1960, hubbard, published, a, book, on, past, lives, entitled, have, you, lived, before, this, life, in, 1968, he, wrote, mission, into, time, a, report, on, a, five, week, sailing, expedition, to, sardinia, sicily, and, carthage, to, see, if, specific, evidence, could, be, found, to, substantiate, l, ron, hubbard, s, recall, of, incidents, in, his, own, past, centuries, ago, wicca, is, a, neo, pagan, religion, focused, on, nature, guided, by, the, philosophy, of, wiccan, rede, that, advocates, the, tenets, harm, none, do, as, ye, will, wiccans, believe, in, a, form, of, karmic, return, where, one, s, deeds, are, returned, either, in, the, current, life, or, in, another, life, threefold, or, multiple, times, in, order, to, teach, one, lessons, the, threefold, law, reincarnation, is, therefore, an, accepted, part, of, the, wiccan, faith, wiccans, also, believe, that, death, and, afterlife, are, important, experiences, for, the, soul, to, transform, and, prepare, for, future, lifetimes, while, there, has, been, no, scientific, confirmation, of, the, physical, reality, of, reincarnation, where, the, subject, has, been, discussed, there, are, questions, of, whether, and, how, such, beliefs, may, be, justified, within, the, discourse, of, science, and, religion, some, champions, of, academic, parapsychology, have, argued, that, they, have, scientific, evidence, even, while, their, detractors, have, accused, them, of, practicing, a, form, of, pseudoscience, skeptic, carl, sagan, asked, the, dalai, lama, what, he, would, do, if, a, fundamental, tenet, of, his, religion, reincarnation, were, definitively, disproved, by, science, the, dalai, lama, answered, if, science, can, disprove, reincarnation, tibetan, buddhism, would, abandon, reincarnation, but, it, s, going, to, be, mighty, hard, to, disprove, reincarnation, sagan, considered, claims, of, memories, of, past, lives, to, be, worthy, of, research, although, he, considered, reincarnation, to, be, an, unlikely, explanation, for, these, over, a, period, of, 40, years, psychiatrist, ian, stevenson, from, the, university, of, virginia, recorded, case, studies, of, young, children, who, claimed, to, remember, past, lives, he, published, twelve, books, including, twenty, cases, suggestive, of, reincarnation, reincarnation, and, biology, a, contribution, to, the, etiology, of, birthmarks, and, birth, defects, a, two, part, monograph, european, cases, of, the, reincarnation, type, and, where, reincarnation, and, biology, intersect, in, his, cases, he, reported, the, child, s, statements, and, testimony, from, family, members, and, others, often, along, with, what, he, considered, to, be, correlates, to, a, deceased, person, who, in, some, ways, seemed, to, match, the, child, s, memory, stevenson, also, investigated, cases, where, he, thought, that, birthmarks, and, birth, defects, seemed, to, match, wounds, and, scars, on, the, deceased, sometimes, included, in, his, documentation, were, medical, records, like, autopsy, photographs, as, any, claim, of, past, life, memory, is, subject, to, charges, of, false, memories, and, the, ease, with, which, such, claims, can, be, hoaxed, stevenson, expected, the, controversy, and, skepticism, of, his, beliefs, that, followed, he, said, that, he, looked, for, disconfirming, evidence, and, alternative, explanations, for, reports, but, as, the, washington, post, reported, he, typically, concluded, that, no, normal, explanation, sufficed, other, academic, researchers, who, have, undertaken, similar, pursuits, include, jim, b, tucker, antonia, mills, satwant, pasricha, godwin, samararatne, and, erlendur, haraldsson, but, stevenson, s, publications, remain, the, most, well, known, stevenson, s, work, in, this, regard, was, impressive, enough, to, carl, sagan, that, he, referred, to, what, were, apparently, stevenson, s, investigations, in, his, book, the, demon, haunted, world, as, an, example, of, carefully, collected, empirical, data, and, though, he, rejected, reincarnation, as, a, parsimonious, explanation, for, the, stories, he, wrote, that, the, phenomenon, of, alleged, past, life, memories, should, be, further, researched, sam, harris, cited, stevenson, s, works, in, his, book, the, end, of, faith, as, part, of, a, body, of, data, that, seems, to, attest, to, the, reality, of, psychic, phenomena, stevenson, s, claims, have, been, subject, to, criticism, and, debunking, for, example, by, the, philosopher, paul, edwards, who, contended, that, ian, stevenson, s, accounts, of, reincarnation, were, purely, anecdotal, and, cherry, picked, edwards, attributed, the, stories, to, selective, thinking, suggestion, and, false, memories, that, result, from, the, family, s, or, researcher, s, belief, systems, and, thus, did, not, rise, to, the, standard, of, fairly, sampled, empirical, evidence, the, philosopher, keith, augustine, wrote, in, critique, that, the, fact, that, the, vast, majority, of, stevenson, s, cases, come, from, countries, where, a, religious, belief, in, reincarnation, is, strong, and, rarely, elsewhere, seems, to, indicate, that, cultural, conditioning, rather, than, reincarnation, generates, claims, of, spontaneous, past, life, memories, further, ian, wilson, wrote, that, a, large, number, of, stevenson, s, cases, consisted, of, poor, children, remembering, wealthy, lives, or, belonging, to, a, higher, caste, in, these, societies, claims, of, reincarnation, have, been, used, as, schemes, to, obtain, money, from, the, richer, families, of, alleged, former, incarnations, robert, baker, asserted, that, all, the, past, life, experiences, investigated, by, stevenson, and, other, parapsychologists, are, understandable, in, terms, of, known, psychological, factors, including, a, mixture, of, cryptomnesia, and, confabulation, edwards, also, objected, that, reincarnation, invokes, assumptions, that, are, inconsistent, with, modern, science, as, the, vast, majority, of, people, do, not, remember, previous, lives, and, there, is, no, empirically, documented, mechanism, known, that, allows, personality, to, survive, death, and, travel, to, another, body, positing, the, existence, of, reincarnation, is, subject, to, the, principle, that, extraordinary, claims, require, extraordinary, evidence, stevenson, also, claimed, there, were, a, handful, of, cases, that, suggested, evidence, of, xenoglossy, including, two, where, a, subject, under, hypnosis, allegedly, conversed, with, people, speaking, the, foreign, language, instead, of, merely, being, able, to, recite, foreign, words, sarah, thomason, a, linguist, and, skeptical, researcher, at, the, university, of, michigan, reanalyzed, these, cases, concluding, that, the, linguistic, evidence, is, too, weak, to, provide, support, for, the, claims, of, xenoglossy, some, believers, in, reincarnation, stevenson, not, among, them, give, much, importance, to, supposed, past, life, memories, retrieved, under, hypnosis, during, past, life, regressions, popularized, by, psychiatrist, brian, weiss, who, claims, he, has, regressed, more, than, 4, 000, patients, since, 1980, the, technique, is, often, identified, as, a, kind, of, pseudoscientific, practice, such, supposed, memories, have, been, documented, to, contain, historical, inaccuracies, originating, from, modern, popular, culture, common, beliefs, about, history, or, books, that, discuss, historical, events, experiments, with, subjects, undergoing, past, life, regression, indicate, that, a, belief, in, reincarnation, and, suggestions, by, the, hypnotist, are, the, two, most, important, factors, regarding, the, contents, of, memories, reported, the, use, of, hypnosis, and, suggestive, questions, can, tend, to, leave, the, subject, particularly, likely, to, hold, distorted, or, false, memories, rather, than, recall, of, a, previous, existence, the, source, of, the, memories, is, more, likely, cryptomnesia, and, confabulations, that, combine, experiences, knowledge, imagination, and, suggestion, or, guidance, from, the, hypnotist, once, created, those, memories, are, indistinguishable, from, memories, based, on, events, that, occurred, during, the, subject, s, life, past, life, regression, has, been, critiqued, for, being, unethical, on, the, grounds, that, it, lacks, any, evidence, to, support, its, claims, and, that, it, increases, one, s, susceptibility, to, false, memories, luis, cord, n, states, that, this, can, be, problematic, as, it, creates, delusions, under, the, guise, of, therapy, the, memories, are, experienced, as, being, as, vivid, as, those, based, on, events, experienced, in, one, s, life, and, impossible, to, differentiate, from, true, memories, of, actual, events, and, accordingly, any, damage, can, be, difficult, to, undo, apa, accredited, organizations, have, challenged, the, use, of, past, life, regressions, as, a, therapeutic, method, calling, it, unethical, additionally, the, hypnotic, methodology, that, underpins, past, life, regression, has, been, criticized, as, placing, the, participant, in, a, vulnerable, position, susceptible, to, implantation, of, false, memories, because, the, implantation, of, false, memories, may, be, harmful, gabriel, andrade, argues, that, past, life, regression, violates, the, principle, of, first, do, no, harm, non, maleficence, part, of, the, hippocratic, oath
