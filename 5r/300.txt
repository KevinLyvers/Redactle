practice, of, their, traditional, beliefs, with, the, practice, of, abrahamic, religions, these, two, abrahamic, religions, are, widespread, across, africa, though, mostly, concentrated, in, different, regions, abrahamic, religious, beliefs, especially, monotheistic, elements, such, as, the, belief, in, a, single, creator, god, were, introduced, into, traditionally, polytheistic, african,

religion, a, traditional, igbo, religion, are, on, the, rise, the, religions, of, the, igbo, and, yoruba, are, popular, in, the, caribbean, and, portions, of, central, and, south, america, in, the, united, states, voodoo, is, more, predominant, in, the, states, along, the, gulf, of, mexico, highly, complex, animistic, beliefs, build, the, core, concept, of, traditional, african, religions, this, includes, the, worship, of, tutelary, deities, nature, worship, ancestor, worship, and, the, belief, in, an, afterlife, comparable, to, other, traditional, religions, around, the, world, while, some, religions, have, a, pantheistic, worldview, with, a, supreme, creator, god, next, to, other, gods, and, spirits, others, follow, a, purely, polytheistic, system, with, various, gods, spirits, and, other, supernatural, beings, traditional, african, religions, also, have, elements, of, totemism, shamanism, and, veneration, of, relics, traditional, african, religion, like, most, other, ancient, traditions, around, the, world, were, based, on, oral, traditions, these, traditions, are, not, religious, principles, but, a, cultural, identity, that, is, passed, on, through, stories, myths, and, tales, from, one, generation, to, the, next, the, community, one, s, family, and, the, environment, play, an, important, role, in, one, s, personal, life, followers, believe, in, the, guidance, of, their, ancestors, spirits, among, many, traditional, african, religions, there, are, spiritual, leaders, and, kinds, of, priests, these, individuals, are, essential, in, the, spiritual, and, religious, survival, of, the, community, there, are, mystics, that, are, responsible, for, healing, and, divining, a, kind, of, fortune, telling, and, counseling, similar, to, shamans, these, traditional, healers, have, to, be, called, by, ancestors, or, gods, they, undergo, strict, training, and, learn, many, necessary, skills, including, how, to, use, natural, herbs, for, healing, and, other, more, mystical, skills, like, the, finding, of, a, hidden, object, without, knowing, where, it, is, traditional, african, religions, believe, that, ancestors, maintain, a, spiritual, connection, with, their, living, relatives, most, ancestral, spirits, are, generally, good, and, kind, negative, actions, taken, by, ancestral, spirits, are, to, cause, minor, illnesses, to, warn, people, that, they, have, gotten, onto, the, wrong, path, native, african, religions, are, centered, on, ancestor, worship, the, belief, in, a, spirit, world, supernatural, beings, and, free, will, unlike, the, later, developed, concept, of, faith, deceased, humans, and, animals, or, important, objects, still, exist, in, the, spirit, world, and, can, influence, or, interact, with, the, physical, world, forms, of, polytheism, was, widespread, in, most, of, ancient, african, and, other, regions, of, the, world, before, the, introduction, of, islam, christianity, and, judaism, an, exception, was, the, short, lived, monotheistic, religion, created, by, pharaoh, akhenaten, who, made, it, mandatory, to, pray, to, his, personal, god, aten, see, atenism, this, remarkable, change, to, traditional, egyptian, religion, was, however, reverted, by, his, youngest, son, tutankhamun, high, gods, along, with, other, more, specialized, deities, ancestor, spirits, territorial, spirits, and, beings, are, a, common, theme, among, traditional, african, religions, highlighting, the, complex, and, advanced, culture, of, ancient, africa, some, research, suggests, that, certain, monotheistic, concepts, such, as, the, belief, in, a, high, god, or, force, next, to, many, other, gods, deities, and, spirits, sometimes, seen, as, intermediaries, between, humans, and, the, creator, were, present, within, africa, before, the, introduction, of, abrahamic, religions, these, indigenous, concepts, were, different, from, the, monotheism, found, in, abrahamic, religions, traditional, african, medicine, is, also, directly, linked, to, traditional, african, religions, according, to, clemmont, e, vontress, the, various, religious, traditions, of, africa, are, united, by, a, basic, animism, according, to, him, the, belief, in, spirits, and, ancestors, is, the, most, important, element, of, african, religions, gods, were, either, self, created, or, evolved, from, spirits, or, ancestors, which, got, worshiped, by, the, people, he, also, notes, that, most, modern, african, folk, religions, were, strongly, influenced, by, non, african, religions, mostly, christianity, and, islam, and, thus, may, differ, from, the, ancient, forms, traditional, african, religions, generally, hold, the, beliefs, of, life, after, death, a, spirit, world, or, realms, in, which, spirits, but, also, gods, reside, with, some, also, having, a, concept, of, reincarnation, in, which, deceased, humans, may, reincarnate, into, their, family, lineage, blood, lineage, if, they, want, to, or, have, something, to, do, there, are, often, similarities, between, traditional, african, religions, located, in, the, same, subregion, central, africa, for, instance, has, similar, religious, traditions, in, countries, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, the, republic, of, the, congo, rwanda, burundi, zambia, and, malawi, the, people, in, these, countries, who, follow, traditional, religious, practices, often, venerate, ancestors, through, rituals, and, worship, the, land, or, a, divinity, through, regional, cults, or, shrine, cults, respectively, jacob, olupona, nigerian, american, professor, of, indigenous, african, religions, at, harvard, university, summarized, the, many, traditional, african, religions, as, complex, animistic, religious, traditions, and, beliefs, of, the, african, people, before, the, christian, and, islamic, colonization, of, africa, ancestor, veneration, has, always, played, a, significant, part, in, the, traditional, african, cultures, and, may, be, considered, as, central, to, the, african, worldview, ancestors, ancestral, ghosts, spirits, are, an, integral, part, of, reality, the, ancestors, are, generally, believed, to, reside, in, an, ancestral, realm, spiritworld, while, some, believe, that, the, ancestors, became, equal, in, power, to, deities, the, defining, line, between, deities, and, ancestors, is, often, contested, but, overall, ancestors, are, believed, to, occupy, a, higher, level, of, existence, than, living, human, beings, and, are, believed, to, be, able, to, bestow, either, blessings, or, illness, upon, their, living, descendants, ancestors, can, offer, advice, and, bestow, good, fortune, and, honor, to, their, living, descendants, but, they, can, also, make, demands, such, as, insisting, that, their, shrines, be, properly, maintained, and, propitiated, a, belief, in, ancestors, also, testifies, to, the, inclusive, nature, of, traditional, african, spirituality, by, positing, that, deceased, progenitors, still, play, a, role, in, the, lives, of, their, living, descendants, olupona, rejects, the, western, islamic, definition, of, monotheism, and, says, that, such, concepts, could, not, reflect, the, complex, african, traditions, and, are, too, simplistic, while, some, traditions, have, a, supreme, being, next, to, other, deities, others, have, not, monotheism, does, not, reflect, the, multiplicity, of, ways, that, the, traditional, african, spirituality, has, conceived, of, deities, gods, and, spirit, beings, he, summarizes, that, traditional, african, religions, are, not, only, religions, but, a, worldview, a, way, of, life, west, and, central, african, religious, practices, generally, manifest, themselves, in, communal, ceremonies, or, divinatory, rites, in, which, members, of, the, community, overcome, by, force, or, ashe, nyama, etc, are, excited, to, the, point, of, going, into, meditative, trance, in, response, to, rhythmic, or, driving, drumming, or, singing, one, religious, ceremony, practiced, in, gabon, and, cameroon, is, the, okuyi, practiced, by, several, bantu, ethnic, groups, in, this, state, depending, upon, the, region, drumming, or, instrumental, rhythms, played, by, respected, musicians, each, of, which, is, unique, to, a, given, deity, or, ancestor, participants, embody, a, deity, or, ancestor, energy, or, state, of, mind, by, performing, distinct, ritual, movements, or, dances, which, further, enhance, their, elevated, consciousness, when, this, trance, like, state, is, witnessed, and, understood, adherents, are, privy, to, a, way, of, contemplating, the, pure, or, symbolic, embodiment, of, a, particular, mindset, or, frame, of, reference, this, builds, skills, at, separating, the, feelings, elicited, by, this, mindset, from, their, situational, manifestations, in, daily, life, such, separation, and, subsequent, contemplation, of, the, nature, and, sources, of, pure, energy, or, feelings, serves, to, help, participants, manage, and, accept, them, when, they, arise, in, mundane, contexts, this, facilitates, better, control, and, transformation, of, these, energies, into, positive, culturally, appropriate, behavior, thought, and, speech, also, this, practice, can, give, rise, to, those, in, these, trances, uttering, words, which, when, interpreted, by, a, culturally, educated, initiate, or, diviner, can, provide, insight, into, appropriate, directions, which, the, community, or, individual, might, take, in, accomplishing, its, goal, followers, of, traditional, african, religions, pray, to, various, spirits, as, well, as, to, their, ancestors, this, includes, also, nature, elementary, and, animal, spirits, the, difference, between, powerful, spirits, and, gods, is, often, minimal, most, african, societies, believe, in, several, high, gods, and, a, large, amount, of, lower, gods, and, spirits, there, are, also, some, religions, with, a, single, supreme, being, chukwu, nyame, olodumare, ngai, roog, etc, some, recognize, a, dual, god, and, goddess, such, as, mawu, lisa, traditional, african, religions, generally, believe, in, an, afterlife, one, or, more, spirit, worlds, ancestor, worship, is, an, important, basic, concept, in, nearly, all, african, religions, some, african, religions, adopted, different, views, through, the, influence, of, islam, or, even, hinduism, there, are, more, similarities, than, differences, between, all, traditional, african, religions, although, jacob, olupona, has, written, that, it, is, difficult, to, truly, generalize, them, because, of, the, sheer, amount, of, differences, and, variations, between, the, traditions, the, deities, and, spirits, are, honored, through, libation, or, sacrifice, of, animals, vegetables, cooked, food, flowers, semi, precious, stones, or, precious, metals, the, will, of, the, gods, or, spirits, is, sought, by, the, believer, also, through, consultation, of, divinities, or, divination, traditional, african, religions, embrace, natural, phenomena, ebb, and, tide, waxing, and, waning, moon, rain, and, drought, and, the, rhythmic, pattern, of, agriculture, according, to, gottlieb, and, mbiti, the, environment, and, nature, are, infused, in, every, aspect, of, traditional, african, religions, and, culture, this, is, largely, because, cosmology, and, beliefs, are, intricately, intertwined, with, the, natural, phenomena, and, environment, all, aspects, of, weather, thunder, lightning, rain, day, moon, sun, stars, and, so, on, may, become, amenable, to, control, through, the, cosmology, of, african, people, natural, phenomena, are, responsible, for, providing, people, with, their, daily, needs, for, example, in, the, serer, religion, one, of, the, most, sacred, stars, in, the, cosmos, is, called, yoonir, the, star, of, sirius, with, a, long, farming, tradition, the, serer, high, priests, and, priestesses, saltigue, deliver, yearly, sermons, at, the, xooy, ceremony, divination, ceremony, in, fatick, before, yoonir, s, phase, in, order, to, predict, winter, months, and, enable, farmers, to, start, planting, traditional, healers, are, common, in, most, areas, and, their, practices, include, a, religious, element, to, varying, degrees, since, africa, is, a, large, continent, with, many, ethnic, groups, and, cultures, there, is, not, one, single, technique, of, casting, divination, the, practice, of, casting, may, be, done, with, small, objects, such, as, bones, cowrie, shells, stones, strips, of, leather, or, flat, pieces, of, wood, some, castings, are, done, using, sacred, divination, plates, made, of, wood, or, performed, on, the, ground, often, within, a, circle, in, traditional, african, societies, many, people, seek, out, diviners, on, a, regular, basis, there, are, generally, no, prohibitions, against, the, practice, diviners, also, known, as, priests, are, sought, for, their, wisdom, as, counselors, in, life, and, for, their, knowledge, of, herbal, medicine, ubuntu, is, an, nguni, bantu, term, meaning, humanity, it, is, sometimes, translated, as, i, am, because, we, are, also, i, am, because, you, are, or, humanity, towards, others, in, zulu, umuntu, ngumuntu, ngabantu, in, xhosa, the, latter, term, is, used, but, is, often, meant, in, a, more, philosophical, sense, to, mean, the, belief, in, a, universal, bond, of, sharing, that, connects, all, humanity, it, is, a, collection, of, values, and, practices, that, people, of, africa, or, of, african, origin, view, as, making, people, authentic, human, beings, while, the, nuances, of, these, values, and, practices, vary, across, different, ethnic, groups, they, all, point, to, one, thing, an, authentic, individual, human, being, is, part, of, a, larger, and, more, significant, relational, communal, societal, environmental, and, spiritual, world, virtue, in, traditional, african, religion, is, often, connected, with, carrying, out, communal, obligations, examples, include, social, behaviors, such, as, the, respect, for, parents, and, elders, raising, children, appropriately, providing, hospitality, and, being, honest, trustworthy, and, courageous, in, some, traditional, african, religions, morality, is, associated, with, obedience, or, disobedience, to, god, regarding, the, way, a, person, or, a, community, lives, for, the, kikuyu, according, to, their, primary, supreme, creator, ngai, acting, through, the, lesser, deities, is, believed, to, speak, to, and, be, capable, of, guiding, the, virtuous, person, as, one, s, conscience, in, many, cases, africans, who, have, converted, to, other, religions, have, still, kept, up, their, traditional, customs, and, practices, combining, them, in, a, syncretic, way, some, sacred, or, holy, locations, for, traditional, religions, include, but, not, limited, to, nri, igbo, the, point, of, sangomar, yaboyabo, fatick, ife, oyo, dahomey, benin, city, ouidah, nsukka, kanem, bornu, igbo, ukwu, and, tulwap, kipsigis, among, others, traditional, african, religions, have, interacted, with, other, major, world, religions, in, various, ways, ranging, from, syncretism, and, coexistence, to, conflict, and, competition, these, interactions, have, significantly, shaped, the, religious, landscape, in, africa, the, introduction, of, christianity, by, european, missionaries, brought, profound, changes, to, the, religious, practices, in, africa, while, some, communities, fully, embraced, christianity, others, blended, christian, teachings, with, their, traditional, beliefs, leading, to, syncretic, practices, for, example, in, parts, of, west, africa, certain, christian, denominations, incorporate, traditional, rituals, and, symbols, into, their, worship, reflecting, the, enduring, influence, of, traditional, african, religions, islam, s, spread, across, north, and, west, africa, also, had, a, significant, impact, on, traditional, african, religions, traditional, african, religions, and, islam, have, coexisted, for, centuries, often, blending, elements, of, islamic, belief, with, traditional, practices, in, regions, like, senegal, and, mali, sufi, islam, often, integrates, aspects, of, local, spiritual, practices, reflecting, a, deep, synergy, between, traditional, african, religions, and, islamic, mysticism, in, contemporary, africa, many, people, identify, with, both, traditional, african, religions, and, either, christianity, or, islam, practicing, elements, of, both, in, a, form, of, religious, duality, this, syncretism, is, evident, in, rituals, festivals, and, the, spiritual, lives, of, individuals, who, draw, on, the, strengths, of, both, their, indigenous, traditions, and, the, newer, religions, however, tensions, have, arisen, particularly, where, aggressive, proselytism, by, christian, or, islamic, groups, has, sought, to, replace, traditional, african, religions, entirely, these, tensions, have, sometimes, led, to, the, marginalization, of, traditional, african, religions, though, it, continues, to, play, a, vital, role, in, the, cultural, and, spiritual, life, of, many, african, communities, traditional, african, religions, have, faced, persecution, from, christians, and, muslims, adherents, of, these, religions, have, been, forcefully, converted, to, islam, and, christianity, demonized, and, marginalized, the, atrocities, include, killings, waging, war, destroying, of, sacred, places, and, other, atrocities, because, of, persecution, and, discrimination, as, well, as, incompatibility, with, traditional, society, culture, and, native, beliefs, the, dinka, people, largely, rejected, or, ignored, islamic, and, christian, teachings, bandama, and, babalola, 2023, states, the, view, of, science, as, embedded, practice, intimately, connected, with, ritual, for, example, is, considered, ascientific, pseudo, science, or, magic, in, western, perspective, in, africa, there, is, a, strong, connection, between, the, physical, and, the, terrestrial, worlds, the, deities, and, gods, are, the, emissaries, of, the, supreme, god, and, the, patrons, in, charge, of, the, workability, of, the, processes, involved, in, the, ile, ife, pantheon, for, example, olokun, the, goddess, of, wealth, is, considered, the, patron, of, the, glass, industry, and, is, therefore, consulted, sacrifices, are, offered, to, appease,

spirits, such, as, the, orisha, loa, vodun, nkisi, and, alusi, among, others, in, addition, to, the, religious, syncretism, of, these, various, african, traditions, many, also, incorporate, elements, of, folk, catholicism, including, folk, saints, and, other, forms, of, folk, religion, native, american, religion, spiritism, spiritualism, shamanism, sometimes, including, the, use, of, entheogens,
