this, perception, is, a, product, of, romanticism, and, the, classical, scholarship, of, the, 19th, century, which, valued, greek, civilization, as, more, authentically, creative, from, the, renaissance, to, the, 18th, century, however, roman, myths, were, an, inspiration, particularly, for, european, painting, the, roman, tradition, is, rich, in, historical, myths, or, legends, concerning, the, foundation, and, rise, of, the, city, these, narratives, focus, on, human, actors, with, only, occasional, intervention, from, deities, but, a, pervasive, sense, of, divinely, ordered, destiny, in, rome, s, earliest, period, history, and, myth, have, a, mutual, and, complementary, relationship, as, t, p, wiseman, notes, the, roman, stories, still, matter, as, they,

mos, maiorum, or, failures, to, do, so, narratives, of, divine, activity, played, a, more, important, role, in, the, system, of, greek, religious, belief, than, among, the, romans, for, whom, ritual, and, cultus, were, primary, although, roman, religion, was, not, based, on, scriptures, and, their, exegesis, priestly, literature, was, one, of, the, earliest, written, forms, of, latin, prose, the,

was, honored, in, march, and, october, quirinus, was, the, patron, of, the, armed, community, in, time, of, peace, the, 19th, century, scholar, georg, wissowa, thought, that, the, romans, distinguished, two, classes, of, gods, the, di, indigetes, and, the, di, novensides, or, novensiles, the, indigetes, were, the, original, gods, of, the, roman, state, their, names, and, nature,
