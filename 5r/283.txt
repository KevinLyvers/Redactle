traditionally, credited, to, the, 8th, century, hindu, philosopher, and, saint, adi, shankara, as, a, part, of, his, efforts, to, start, major, hindu, gatherings, for, philosophical, discussions, and, debates, along, with, hindu, monasteries, across, the, indian, subcontinent, however, there, is, no, historical, literary, evidence, of, these, mass, pilgrimages, called, kumbha, mela, prior, to, the, 19th, century, there, is, ample, evidence, in, historical, manuscripts, and, inscriptions, of, an, annual, magha, mela, in, hinduism, with, periodic, larger, gatherings, after, 6, or, 12, years, where, pilgrims, gathered, in, massive, numbers, and, where, one, of, the, rituals, included, a, sacred, dip, in, a, river, or, holy, tank, according, to, kama, maclean, the, socio, political, developments, during, the, colonial, era, and, a, reaction, to, orientalism, led, to, the, rebranding, and, remobilisation, of, the, ancient, magha, mela, as, the, modern, era, kumbh, mela, particularly, after, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, the, weeks, over, which, the, festival, is, observed, cycle, at, each, site, approximately, once, every, 12, years, based, on, the, hindu, luni,

maha, major, and, ardha, half, kumbh, melas, the, exact, years, particularly, for, the, kumbh, melas, at, ujjain, and, nashik, have, been, a, subject, of, dispute, in, the, 20th, century, the, nashik, and, ujjain, festivals, have, been, celebrated, in, the, same, year, or, one, year, apart, typically, about, 3, years, after, the, allahabad, prayagraj, kumbh, mela, elsewhere, in, many, parts, of, india, similar, but, smaller, community, pilgrimage, and, bathing, festivals, are, called, the, magha, mela, makar, mela, or, equivalent, for, example, in, tamil, nadu, the, magha, mela, with, water, dip, ritual, is, a, festival, of, antiquity, this, festival, is, held, at, the, mahamaham, tank, near, kaveri, river, every, 12, years, at, kumbakonam, attracts, millions, of, south, indian, hindus, and, has, been, described, as, the, tamil, kumbh, mela, other, places, where, the, magha, mela, or, makar, mela, bathing, pilgrimage, and, fairs, have, been, called, kumbh, mela, include, kurukshetra, sonipat, and, panauti, nepal, the, kumbh, melas, have, three, dates, around, which, the, significant, majority, of, pilgrims, participate, while, the, festival, itself, lasts, between, one, and, three, months, around, these, dates, each, festival, attracts, millions, with, the, largest, gathering, at, the, prayag, kumbh, mela, and, the, second, largest, at, haridwar, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, and, indian, authorities, more, than, 200, million, hindus, gathered, for, the, kumbh, mela, in, 2019, including, 50, million, on, the, festival, s, most, crowded, day, the, festival, is, one, of, the, largest, peaceful, gatherings, in, the, world, and, considered, as, the, world, s, largest, congregation, of, religious, pilgrims, it, has, been, inscribed, on, the, unesco, s, representative, list, of, intangible, cultural, heritage, of, humanity, the, festival, is, observed, over, many, days, with, the, day, of, amavasya, attracting, the, largest, number, on, a, single, day, the, kumbh, mela, authorities, said, that, the, largest, one, day, attendance, at, the, kumbh, mela, was, 30, million, on, 10, february, 2013, and, 50, million, on, 4, february, 2019, the, kumbha, in, kumbha, mela, literally, means, pitcher, jar, pot, in, sanskrit, it, is, found, in, the, vedic, texts, in, this, sense, often, in, the, context, of, holding, water, or, in, mythical, legends, about, the, nectar, of, immortality, the, word, kumbha, or, its, derivatives, are, found, in, the, rigveda, 1500, 1200, bce, for, example, in, verse, 10, 89, 7, verse, 19, 16, of, the, yajurveda, verse, 6, 3, of, samaveda, verse, 19, 53, 3, of, the, atharvaveda, and, other, vedic, and, post, vedic, ancient, sanskrit, literature, in, astrological, texts, the, term, also, refers, to, the, zodiac, sign, of, aquarius, the, astrological, etymology, dates, to, late, 1st, millennium, ce, likely, influenced, by, greek, zodiac, ideas, the, word, mela, means, unite, join, meet, move, together, assembly, junction, in, sanskrit, particularly, in, the, context, of, fairs, community, celebration, this, word, too, is, found, in, the, rigveda, and, other, ancient, hindu, texts, thus, kumbh, mela, means, an, assembly, meet, union, around, water, or, nectar, of, immortality, many, hindus, believe, that, the, kumbh, mela, originated, in, times, immemorial, and, is, attested, in, the, hindu, mythology, about, samudra, manthana, lit, churning, of, the, ocean, found, in, the, vedic, texts, historians, in, contrast, reject, these, claims, as, none, of, the, ancient, or, medieval, era, texts, that, mention, the, samudra, manthana, legend, ever, link, it, to, a, mela, or, festival, according, to, giorgio, bonazzoli, a, scholar, of, sanskrit, puranas, these, are, anachronistic, explanations, an, adaptation, of, early, legends, to, a, later, practice, by, a, small, circle, of, adherents, who, have, sought, the, roots, of, a, highly, popular, pilgrimage, and, festival, the, hindu, legend, however, describes, the, creation, of, a, pot, of, amrita, nectar, of, immortality, after, the, forces, of, good, and, evil, churn, the, ocean, of, creation, the, gods, and, demons, fight, over, this, pot, the, kumbha, of, nectar, in, order, to, gain, immortality, in, a, later, day, extension, to, the, legend, the, pot, is, spilled, at, four, places, and, that, is, the, origin, of, the, four, kumbha, melas, the, story, varies, and, is, inconsistent, with, some, stating, vishnu, as, mohini, avatar, others, stating, dhanavantari, or, garuda, or, indra, spilling, the, pot, this, spilling, and, associated, kumbh, mela, story, is, not, found, in, the, earliest, mentions, of, the, original, legend, of, samudra, manthana, churning, of, the, ocean, such, as, the, vedic, era, texts, pre, 500, bce, nor, is, this, story, found, in, the, later, era, puranas, 3rd, to, 10th, century, ce, while, the, kumbha, mela, phrase, is, not, found, in, the, ancient, or, medieval, era, texts, numerous, chapters, and, verses, in, hindu, texts, are, found, about, a, bathing, festival, the, sacred, junction, of, rivers, ganga, yamuna, and, mythical, saraswati, at, prayag, and, pilgrimage, to, prayag, these, are, in, the, form, of, snana, bathe, ritual, and, in, the, form, of, prayag, mahatmya, greatness, of, prayag, historical, tour, guides, in, sanskrit, the, earliest, mention, of, prayag, and, the, bathing, pilgrimage, is, found, in, rigveda, pari, i, a, supplement, to, the, rigveda, it, is, also, mentioned, in, the, pali, canons, of, buddhism, such, as, in, section, 1, 7, of, majjhima, nikaya, wherein, the, buddha, states, that, bathing, in, payaga, skt, prayaga, cannot, wash, away, cruel, and, evil, deeds, rather, the, virtuous, one, should, be, pure, in, heart, and, fair, in, action, the, mahabharata, mentions, a, bathing, pilgrimage, at, prayag, as, a, means, of, pr, ya, citta, atonement, penance, for, past, mistakes, and, guilt, in, tirthayatra, parva, before, the, great, war, the, epic, states, the, one, who, observes, firm, vows, having, bathed, at, prayaga, during, magha, o, best, of, the, bharatas, becomes, spotless, and, reaches, heaven, in, anushasana, parva, after, the, war, the, epic, elaborates, this, bathing, pilgrimage, as, geographical, tirtha, that, must, be, combined, with, manasa, tirtha, tirtha, of, the, heart, whereby, one, lives, by, values, such, as, truth, charity, self, control, patience, and, others, there, are, other, references, to, prayaga, and, river, side, festivals, in, ancient, indian, texts, including, at, the, places, where, present, day, kumbh, melas, are, held, but, the, exact, age, of, the, kumbh, mela, is, uncertain, the, 7th, century, buddhist, chinese, traveller, xuanzang, hiuen, tsang, mentions, king, harsha, and, his, capital, of, prayag, which, he, states, to, be, a, sacred, hindu, city, with, hundreds, of, deva, temples, and, two, buddhist, institutions, he, also, mentions, the, hindu, bathing, rituals, at, the, junction, of, the, rivers, according, to, some, scholars, this, is, the, earliest, surviving, historical, account, of, the, kumbh, mela, which, took, place, in, present, day, prayag, in, 644, ce, kama, maclean, an, indologist, who, has, published, articles, on, the, kumbh, mela, predominantly, based, on, the, colonial, archives, and, english, language, media, states, based, on, emails, from, other, scholars, and, a, more, recent, interpretation, of, the, 7th, century, xuanzang, memoir, the, prayag, event, happened, every, 5, years, and, not, 12, years, featured, a, buddha, statue, involved, alms, giving, and, it, might, have, been, a, buddhist, festival, in, contrast, ariel, glucklich, a, scholar, of, hinduism, and, anthropology, of, religion, the, xuanzang, memoir, includes, somewhat, derisively, the, reputation, of, prayag, as, a, place, where, people, hindus, once, committed, superstitious, devotional, suicide, to, liberate, their, souls, and, how, a, brahmin, of, an, earlier, era, successfully, put, an, end, to, this, practice, this, and, other, details, such, as, the, names, of, temples, and, bathing, pools, suggest, that, xuanzang, presented, hindu, practices, at, prayag, in, the, 7th, century, from, his, buddhist, perspective, and, perhaps, to, amuse, his, audience, back, in, china, states, glucklich, other, early, accounts, of, the, significance, of, prayag, to, hinduism, is, found, in, the, various, versions, of, the, prayaga, mahatmya, dated, to, the, late, 1st, millennium, ce, these, purana, genre, hindu, texts, describe, it, as, a, place, bustling, with, pilgrims, priests, vendors, beggars, guides, and, local, citizens, busy, along, the, confluence, of, the, rivers, sangam, these, sanskrit, guide, books, of, the, medieval, era, india, were, updated, over, its, editions, likely, by, priests, and, guides, who, had, a, mutual, stake, in, the, economic, returns, from, the, visiting, pilgrims, one, of, the, longest, sections, about, prayag, rivers, and, its, significance, to, hindu, pilgrimage, is, found, in, chapters, 103, 112, of, the, matsya, purana, exceedingly, old, pilgrimage, there, is, evidence, enough, to, suggest, that, although, the, magh, mela, or, at, least, the, tradition, of, religious, festival, at, the, triveni, is, exceedingly, old, the, kumbh, mela, at, allahabad, is, much, more, recent, maclean, 2008, p, 91, according, to, james, lochtefeld, a, scholar, of, indian, religions, the, phrase, kumbh, mela, and, historical, data, about, it, is, missing, in, early, indian, texts, however, states, lochtefeld, these, historical, texts, clearly, reveal, large, well, established, bathing, festivals, that, were, either, annual, or, based, on, the, twelve, year, cycle, of, planet, jupiter, manuscripts, related, to, hindu, ascetics, and, warrior, monks, akharas, fighting, the, islamic, sultanates, and, mughal, empire, era, mention, bathing, pilgrimage, and, a, large, periodic, assembly, of, hindus, at, religious, festivals, associated, with, bathing, gift, giving, commerce, and, organisation, an, early, account, of, the, haridwar, kumbh, mela, was, published, by, captain, thomas, hardwicke, in, 1796, ce, according, to, james, mallinson, a, scholar, of, hindu, yoga, manuscripts, and, monastic, institutions, bathing, festivals, at, prayag, with, large, gatherings, of, pilgrims, are, attested, since, at, least, the, middle, of, the, first, millennium, ce, while, textual, evidence, exists, for, similar, pilgrimage, at, other, major, sacred, rivers, since, the, medieval, period, four, of, these, morphed, under, the, kumbh, mela, brand, during, the, east, india, company, rule, british, colonial, era, when, it, sought, to, control, the, war, prone, monks, and, the, lucrative, tax, and, trade, revenues, at, these, hindu, pilgrimage, festivals, additionally, the, priests, sought, the, british, administration, to, recognise, the, festival, and, protect, their, religious, rights, the, 16th, century, ramcharitmanas, of, tulsidas, mentions, an, annual, mela, in, prayag, as, does, a, muslim, historian, s, ain, i, akbari, c, 1590, ce, the, latter, akbar, era, persian, text, calls, prayag, spells, it, priyag, the, king, of, shrines, for, the, hindus, and, mentions, that, it, is, considered, particularly, holy, in, the, hindu, month, of, magha, the, late, 16th, century, tabaqat, i, akbari, also, records, of, an, annual, bathing, festival, at, prayag, sangam, where, various, classes, of, hindus, came, from, all, sides, of, the, country, to, bathe, in, such, numbers, that, the, jungles, and, plains, were, unable, to, hold, them, the, kumbh, mela, of, haridwar, appears, to, be, the, original, kumbh, mela, since, it, is, held, according, to, the, astrological, sign, kumbha, aquarius, and, because, there, are, several, references, to, a, 12, year, cycle, for, it, the, later, mughal, empire, era, texts, that, contain, the, term, kumbha, mela, in, haridwar, s, context, include, khulasat, ut, tawarikh, 1695, 1699, ce, and, chahar, gulshan, 1759, ce, the, khulasat, ut, tawarikh, also, mentions, an, annual, bathing, pilgrimage, festival, in, prayag, but, it, does, not, call, it, kumbh, both, these, mughal, era, texts, use, the, term, kumbh, mela, to, describe, only, haridwar, s, fair, mentioning, a, similar, fair, held, in, prayag, and, nashik, the, khulasat, ut, tawarikh, lists, the, following, melas, an, annual, mela, and, a, kumbh, mela, every, 12, years, at, haridwar, a, mela, held, at, trimbak, when, jupiter, enters, leo, that, is, once, in, 12, years, and, an, annual, mela, held, at, prayag, in, modern, prayagraj, in, magh, like, the, prayag, mela, the, bathing, pilgrimage, mela, at, nasik, and, ujjain, are, of, considerable, antiquity, however, these, were, referred, to, as, singhasth, mela, and, the, phrase, kumbh, mela, is, yet, to, be, found, in, literature, prior, to, the, 19th, century, the, phrases, such, as, maha, kumbh, and, ardh, kumbh, in, the, context, of, the, ancient, religious, pilgrimage, festivals, with, a, different, name, at, prayag, nasik, and, ujjain, are, evidently, of, a, more, modern, era, the, magh, mela, of, prayag, is, probably, the, oldest, among, the, four, modern, day, kumbh, melas, it, dates, from, the, early, centuries, ce, given, it, has, been, mentioned, in, several, early, puranas, however, the, name, kumbh, for, these, more, ancient, bathing, pilgrimages, probably, dates, to, the, mid, 19th, century, d, p, dubey, states, that, none, of, the, ancient, hindu, texts, call, the, prayag, fair, as, a, kumbh, mela, kama, maclean, states, that, the, early, british, records, do, not, mention, the, name, kumbh, mela, or, the, 12, year, cycle, for, the, prayag, fair, the, first, british, reference, to, the, kumbh, mela, in, prayag, occurs, only, in, an, 1868, report, which, mentions, the, need, for, increased, pilgrimage, and, sanitation, controls, at, the, coomb, fair, to, be, held, in, january, 1870, according, to, maclean, the, prayagwal, brahmin, priests, of, prayag, coopted, the, kumbh, legend, and, brand, to, the, annual, prayag, magh, mela, given, the, socio, political, circumstances, in, the, 19th, century, the, kumbh, mela, at, ujjain, began, in, the, 18th, century, when, the, maratha, ruler, ranoji, shinde, invited, ascetics, from, nashik, to, ujjain, for, a, local, festival, like, the, priests, at, prayag, those, at, nashik, and, ujjain, competing, with, other, places, for, a, sacred, status, may, have, adopted, the, kumbh, tradition, for, their, pre, existing, magha, melas, one, of, the, key, features, of, the, kumbh, mela, has, been, the, camps, and, processions, of, the, sadhus, monks, by, the, 18th, century, many, of, these, had, organised, into, one, of, thirteen, akharas, warrior, ascetic, bands, monastic, militia, of, which, ten, were, related, to, hinduism, and, three, related, to, sikhism, seven, have, belonged, to, the, shaivism, tradition, three, to, vaishnavism, two, to, udasis, founded, by, guru, nanak, s, son, and, one, to, nirmalas, these, soldier, monk, traditions, have, been, a, well, established, feature, of, the, indian, society, and, they, are, prominent, feature, of, the, kumbh, melas, until, the, east, india, company, rule, the, kumbh, melas, magha, melas, were, managed, by, these, akharas, they, provide, logistical, arrangements, policing, intervened, and, judged, any, disputes, and, collected, taxes, they, also, have, been, a, central, attraction, and, a, stop, for, mainstream, hindus, who, seek, their, darsana, meeting, view, as, well, as, spiritual, guidance, and, blessings, the, kumbh, melas, have, been, one, of, their, recruitment, and, initiation, venues, as, well, as, the, place, to, trade, these, akharas, have, roots, in, the, hindu, naga, naked, monks, tradition, who, went, to, war, without, clothes, these, monastic, groups, traditionally, credit, the, kumbh, mela, to, the, 8th, century, hindu, philosopher, adi, shankara, as, a, part, of, his, efforts, to, start, monastic, institutions, matha, and, major, hindu, gatherings, for, philosophical, discussions, and, debates, however, there, is, no, historic, literary, evidence, that, he, actually, did, start, the, kumbh, melas, during, the, 17th, century, the, akharas, competed, for, ritual, primacy, priority, rights, to, who, bathes, first, or, at, the, most, auspicious, time, and, prominence, leading, to, violent, conflicts, the, records, from, the, east, india, company, rule, era, report, of, violence, between, the, akharas, and, numerous, deaths, at, the, 1760, kumbh, mela, in, haridwar, a, clash, broke, out, between, shaivite, gosains, and, vaishnavite, bairagis, ascetics, resulting, in, hundreds, of, deaths, a, copper, plate, inscription, of, the, maratha, peshwa, claims, that, 12, 000, ascetics, died, in, a, clash, between, shaivite, sanyasi, s, and, vaishnavite, bairagi, s, at, the, 1789, nashik, kumbh, mela, the, dispute, started, over, the, bathing, order, which, then, indicated, status, of, the, akhara, s, at, the, 1796, kumbh, mela, in, haridwar,

tax, and, trading, opportunities, at, kumbh, melas, in, the, 18th, century, attracted, the, attention, of, the, east, india, company, officials, they, intervened, laid, out, the, camps, trading, spaces, and, established, a, bathing, order, for, each, akhara, after, 1947, the, state, governments, have, taken, over, this, role, and, provide, the, infrastructure, for, the, kumbh, mela, in, their, respective, states, the, kumbh, melas, attract, many, loner, sadhus, monks, who, do, not, belong, to, any, akharas, of, those, who, do, belong, to, a, group, the, thirteen, active, akharas,

dharma, raksha, protection, of, faith, the, kumbh, melas, of, the, past, albeit, with, different, regional, names, attracted, large, attendance, and, have, been, religiously, significant, to, the, hindus, for, centuries, however, they, have, been, more, than, a, religious, event, to, the, hindu, community, historically, the, kumbh, melas, were, also, major, commercial, events, initiation, of, new, recruits, to, the, akharas, prayers, and, community, singing, spiritual, discussions, education, and, a, spectacle, during, the, colonial, era, rule, of, the, east, india, company, its, officials, saw, the, hindu, pilgrimage, as, a, means, to, collect, vast, sums, of, revenue, through, a, pilgrim, tax, and, taxes, on, the, trade, that, occurred, during, the, festival, according, to, dubey, as, well, as, macclean, the, islamic, encyclopaedia, yadgar, i, bahaduri, written, in, 1834, lucknow, described, the, prayag, festival, and, its, sanctity, to, the, hindus, the, british, officials, states, dubey, raised, the, tax, to, amount, greater, than, average, monthly, income, and, the, attendance, fell, drastically, the, prayagwal, pandas, initially, went, along, according, to, colonial, records, but, later, resisted, as, the, impact, of, the, religious, tax, on, the, pilgrims, became, clear, in, 1938, lord, auckland, abolished, the, pilgrim, tax, and, vast, numbers, returned, to, the, pilgrimage, thereafter, according, to, macclean, the, colonial, records, of, this, period, on, the, prayag, mela, present, a, biased, materialistic, view, given, they, were, written, by, colonialists, and, missionaries, baptist, missionary, john, chamberlain, who, visited, the, 1824, ardh, kumbh, mela, at, haridwar, stated, that, a, large, number, of, visitors, came, there, for, trade, he, also, includes, a, 1814, letter, from, his, missionary, friend, who, distributed, copies, of, the, gospel, to, the, pilgrims, and, tried, to, convert, some, to, christianity, according, to, an, 1858, account, of, the, haridwar, kumbh, mela, by, the, british, civil, servant, robert, montgomery, martin, the, visitors, at, the, fair, included, people, from, a, number, of,

one, of, the, social, and, political, mobilisation, venues, and, the, colonial, government, became, keen, on, monitoring, these, developments, after, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, the, government, deployed, police, to, gain, this, intelligence, at, the, grassroots, level, of, kumbh, mela, the, british, officials, in, co, operation, with, the, native, police, also, made, attempts, to, improve,

hostile, and, with, disbelief, states, maclean, the, kumbh, mela, continued, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, independence, movement, through, 1947, as, a, place, where, the, native, people, and, politicians, periodically, gathered, in, large, numbers, in, 1906, the, sanatan, dharm, sabha, met, at, the, prayag, kumbh, mela, and, resolved, to, start, the, banaras, hindu, university, in,

mela, to, conserve, scarce, supplies, of, fuel, the, ban, coupled, with, false, rumours, that, japan, planned, to, bomb, and, commit, genocide, at, the, kumbh, mela, site, led, to, sharply, lower,
