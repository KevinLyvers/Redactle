osiris, o, s, a, r, s, from, egyptian, wsjr, was, the, god, of, fertility, agriculture, the, afterlife, the, dead, resurrection, life, and, vegetation, in, ancient, egyptian, religion, he, was, classically, depicted, as, a, green, skinned, deity, with, a, pharaoh, s, beard, partially, mummy, wrapped, at, the, legs, wearing, a, distinctive, atef, crown, and, holding, a, symbolic, crook, and, flail, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, be, associated, with, the, mummy, wrap, when, his, brother, set, cut, him, up, into, pieces, after, killing, him, osiris, wife, isis, found, all, the, pieces, and, wrapped, his, body, up, enabling, him, to, return, to, life, osiris, was, widely, worshipped, until, the, decline, of, ancient, egyptian, religion, during, the, rise, of, christianity, in, the, roman, empire, osiris, was, at, times, considered, the, eldest, son, of, the, earth, god, geb, and, the, sky, goddess, nut, as, well, as, being, brother, and, husband, of, isis, and, brother, of, set, nephthys, and, horus, the, elder, with, horus, the, younger, being, considered, his, posthumously, begotten, son, through, syncretism, with, iah, he, was, also, a, god, of, the, moon, osiris, was, the, judge, and, lord, of, the, dead, and, the, underworld, the, lord, of, silence, and, khenti, amentiu, meaning, foremost, of, the, westerners, in, the, old, kingdom, 2686, 2181, bc, the, pharaoh, was, considered, a, son, of, the, sun, god, ra, who, after, his, death, ascended, to, join, ra, in, the, sky, after, the, spread, of, the, osiris, cult, however, the, kings, of, egypt, were, associated, with, osiris, in, death, as, osiris, rose, from, the, dead, they, would, unite, with, him, and, inherit, eternal, life, through, imitative, magic, through, the, hope, of, new, life, after, death, osiris, began, to, be, associated, with, the, cycles, in, nature, in, particular, the, sprouting, of, vegetation, and, the, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, river, as, well, as, the, heliacal, rising, of, orion, and, sirius, at, the, start, of, the, new, year, he, became, the, sovereign, that, granted, all, life, he, who, is, permanently, benign, and, youthful, the, first, evidence, of, the, worship, of, osiris, is, from, the, middle, of, the, fifth, dynasty, of, egypt, 25th, century, bc, although, it, is, likely, that, he, was, worshiped, much, earlier, the, khenti, amentiu, epithet, dates, to, at, least, the, first, dynasty, and, was, also, used, as, a, pharaonic, title, most, information, available, on, the, osiris, myth, is, derived, from, allusions, in, the, pyramid, texts, at, the, end, of, the, fifth, dynasty, later, new, kingdom, source, documents, such, as, the, shabaka, stone, and, the, contendings, of, horus, and, seth, and, much, later, in, the, narratives, of, greek, authors, including, plutarch, and, diodorus, siculus, some, egyptologists, believe, the, osiris, mythos, may, have, originated, in, a, former, living, ruler, possibly, a, shepherd, who, lived, in, predynastic, times, 5500, 3100, bc, in, the, nile, delta, whose, beneficial, rule, led, to, him, being, revered, as, a, god, the, accoutrements, of, the, shepherd, the, crook, and, the, flail, once, insignia, of, the, delta, god, andjety, with, whom, osiris, was, associated, support, this, theory, osiris, is, a, latin, transliteration, of, the, ancient, greek, ipa, which, in, turn, is, the, greek, adaptation, of, the, original, name, in, the, egyptian, language, in, egyptian, hieroglyphs, the, name, appears, as, wsjr, which, some, egyptologists, instead, choose, to, transliterate, as, sjr, or, jsjrj, since, hieroglyphic, writing, lacks, vowels, egyptologists, have, vocalized, the, name, in, various, ways, such, as, asar, ausar, ausir, wesir, usir, or, usire, several, proposals, have, been, made, for, the, etymology, and, meaning, of, the, original, name, as, egyptologist, mark, j, smith, notes, none, are, fully, convincing, most, take, wsjr, as, the, accepted, transliteration, following, adolf, erman, however, recently, alternative, transliterations, have, been, proposed, osiris, is, represented, in, his, most, developed, form, of, iconography, wearing, the, atef, crown, which, is, similar, to, the, white, crown, of, upper, egypt, but, with, the, addition, of, two, curling, ostrich, feathers, at, each, side, he, also, carries, the, crook, and, flail, the, crook, is, thought, to, represent, osiris, as, a, shepherd, god, the, symbolism, of, the, flail, is, more, uncertain, with, shepherd, s, whip, fly, whisk, or, association, with, the, god, andjety, of, the, ninth, nome, of, lower, egypt, proposed, he, was, commonly, depicted, as, a, pharaoh, with, a, complexion, of, either, green, the, color, of, rebirth, or, black, alluding, to, the, fertility, of, the, nile, floodplain, in, mummiform, wearing, the, trappings, of, mummification, from, chest, downward, the, pyramid, texts, describe, early, conceptions, of, an, afterlife, in, terms, of, eternal, travelling, with, the, sun, god, amongst, the, stars, amongst, these, mortuary, texts, at, the, beginning, of, the, fourth, dynasty, is, found, an, offering, the, king, gives, and, anubis, by, the, end, of, the, fifth, dynasty, the, formula, in, all, tombs, becomes, an, offering, the, king, gives, and, osiris, osiris, is, the, mythological, father, of, the, god, horus, whose, conception, is, described, in, the, osiris, myth, a, central, myth, in, ancient, egyptian, belief, the, myth, describes, osiris, as, having, been, killed, by, his, brother, set, who, wanted, osiris, throne, his, wife, isis, finds, the, body, of, osiris, and, hides, it, in, the, reeds, where, it, is, found, and, dismembered, by, set, isis, retrieves, and, joins, the, fragmented, pieces, of, osiris, then, briefly, revives, him, by, use, of, magic, this, spell, gives, her, time, to, become, pregnant, by, osiris, isis, later, gives, birth, to, horus, since, horus, was, born, after, osiris, resurrection, horus, became, thought, of, as, a, representation, of, new, beginnings, and, the, vanquisher, of, the, usurper, set, ptah, seker, who, resulted, from, the, identification, of, the, creator, god, ptah, with, seker, thus, gradually, became, identified, with, osiris, the, two, becoming, ptah, seker, osiris, as, the, sun, was, thought, to, spend, the, night, in, the, underworld, and, was, subsequently, reborn, every, morning, ptah, seker, osiris, was, identified, as, king, of, the, underworld, god, of, the, afterlife, life, death, and, regeneration, osiris, also, has, the, aspect, and, form, of, seker, osiris, osiris, soul, or, rather, his, ba, was, occasionally, worshipped, in, its, own, right, almost, as, if, it, were, a, distinct, god, especially, in, the, delta, city, of, mendes, this, aspect, of, osiris, was, referred, to, as, banebdjedet, which, is, grammatically, feminine, also, spelt, banebded, or, banebdjed, literally, the, ba, of, the, lord, of, the, djed, which, roughly, means, the, soul, of, the, lord, of, the, pillar, of, continuity, the, djed, a, type, of, pillar, was, usually, understood, as, the, backbone, of, osiris, the, nile, supplying, water, and, osiris, strongly, connected, to, the, vegetable, regeneration, who, died, only, to, be, resurrected, represented, continuity, and, stability, as, banebdjed, osiris, was, given, epithets, such, as, lord, of, the, sky, and, life, of, the, sun, god, ra, ba, does, not, mean, soul, in, the, western, sense, and, has, to, do, with, power, reputation, force, of, character, especially, in, the, case, of, a, god, since, the, ba, was, associated, with, power, and, also, happened, to, be, a, word, for, ram, in, egyptian, banebdjed, was, depicted, as, a, ram, or, as, ram, headed, a, living, sacred, ram, was, kept, at, mendes, and, worshipped, as, the, incarnation, of, the, god, and, upon, death, the, rams, were, mummified, and, buried, in, a, ram, specific, necropolis, banebdjed, was, consequently, said, to, be, horus, father, as, banebdjed, was, an, aspect, of, osiris, regarding, the, association, of, osiris, with, the, ram, the, god, s, traditional, crook, and, flail, are, the, instruments, of, the, shepherd, which, has, suggested, to, some, scholars, also, an, origin, for, osiris, in, herding, tribes, of, the, upper, nile, plutarch, recounts, one, version, of, the, osiris, myth, in, which, set, osiris, brother, along, with, the, queen, of, ethiopia, conspired, with, 72, accomplices, to, plot, the, assassination, of, osiris, set, fooled, osiris, into, getting, into, a, box, which, set, then, shut, sealed, with, lead, and, threw, into, the, nile, osiris, wife, isis, searched, for, his, remains, until, she, finally, found, him, embedded, in, a, tamarisk, tree, trunk, which, was, holding, up, the, roof, of, a, palace, in, byblos, on, the, phoenician, coast, she, managed, to, remove, the, coffin, and, retrieve, her, husband, s, body, in, one, version, of, the, myth, isis, used, a, spell, to, briefly, revive, osiris, so, he, could, impregnate, her, after, embalming, and, burying, osiris, isis, conceived, and, gave, birth, to, their, son, horus, thereafter, osiris, lived, on, as, the, god, of, the, underworld, because, of, his, death, and, resurrection, osiris, was, associated, with, the, flooding, and, retreating, of, the, nile, and, thus, with, the, yearly, growth, and, death, of, crops, along, the, nile, valley, diodorus, siculus, gives, another, version, of, the, myth, in, which, osiris, was, described, as, an, ancient, king, who, taught, the, egyptians, the, arts, of, civilization, including, agriculture, then, travelled, the, world, with, his, sister, isis, the, satyrs, and, the, nine, muses, before, finally, returning, to, egypt, osiris, was, then, murdered, by, his, evil, brother, typhon, who, was, identified, with, set, typhon, divided, the, body, into, twenty, six, pieces, which, he, distributed, amongst, his, fellow, conspirators, in, order, to, implicate, them, in, the, murder, isis, and, hercules, horus, avenged, the, death, of, osiris, and, slew, typhon, isis, recovered, all, the, parts, of, osiris, body, except, the, phallus, and, secretly, buried, them, she, made, replicas, of, them, and, distributed, them, to, several, locations, which, then, became, centres, of, osiris, worship, annual, ceremonies, were, performed, in, honor, of, osiris, in, various, places, across, egypt, evidences, of, which, were, discovered, during, underwater, archaeological, excavations, of, franck, goddio, and, his, team, in, the, sunken, city, of, thonis, heracleion, these, ceremonies, were, fertility, rites, which, symbolised, the, resurrection, of, osiris, recent, scholars, emphasize, the, androgynous, character, of, fertility, clear, from, surviving, material, for, instance, osiris, fertility, has, to, come, both, from, being, castrated, cut, into, pieces, and, the, reassembly, by, female, isis, whose, embrace, of, her, reassembled, osiris, produces, the, perfect, king, horus, further, as, attested, by, tomb, inscriptions, both, women, and, men, could, syncretize, identify, with, osiris, at, their, death, another, set, of, evidence, that, underlines, osiris, androgynous, nature, plutarch, and, others, have, noted, that, the, sacrifices, to, osiris, were, gloomy, solemn, and, mournful, isis, and, osiris, 69, and, that, the, great, mystery, festival, celebrated, in, two, phases, began, at, abydos, commemorating, the, death, of, the, god, on, the, same, day, that, grain, was, planted, in, the, ground, isis, and, osiris, 13, the, annual, festival, involved, the, construction, of, osiris, beds, formed, in, shape, of, osiris, filled, with, soil, and, sown, with, seed, the, germinating, seed, symbolized, osiris, rising, from, the, dead, an, almost, pristine, example, was, found, in, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, the, imiut, emblem, an, image, of, a, stuffed, headless, skin, of, an, animal, tied, to, a, pole, mounting, a, pot, was, a, symbol, associated, both, with, osiris, as, god, of, the, underworld, and, with, anubis, god, of, mummification, was, sometimes, included, among, a, deceased, person, s, funerary, equipment, the, first, phase, of, the, festival, was, a, public, drama, depicting, the, murder, and, dismemberment, of, osiris, the, search, for, his, body, by, isis, his, triumphal, return, as, the, resurrected, god, and, the, battle, in, which, horus, defeated, set, according, to, julius, firmicus, maternus, of, the, fourth, century, this, play, was, re, enacted, each, year, by, worshippers, who, beat, their, breasts, and, gashed, their, shoulders, when, they, pretend, that, the, mutilated, remains, of, the, god, have, been, found, and, rejoined, they, turn, from, mourning, to, rejoicing, de, errore, profanarum, religionum, the, passion, of, osiris, was, reflected, in, his, name, wenennefer, the, one, who, continues, to, be, perfect, which, also, alludes, to, his, post, mortem, power, b, c, d, f, g, h, i, k, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, u, w, much, of, the, extant, information, about, the, rites, of, osiris, can, be, found, on, the, ikhernofret, stela, at, abydos, erected, in, the, twelfth, dynasty, by, ikhernofret, possibly, a, priest, of, osiris, or, other, official, the, titles, of, ikhernofret, are, described, in, his, stela, from, abydos, during, the, reign, of, senwosret, iii, pharaoh, sesostris, about, 1875, bc, the, ritual, reenactment, of, osiris, s, funeral, rites, were, held, in, the, last, month, of, the, inundation, the, annual, nile, flood, coinciding, with, spring, and, held, at, abydos, which, was, the, traditional, place, where, the, body, of, osiris, drifted, ashore, after, having, been, drowned, in, the, nile, the, part, of, the, myth, recounting, the, chopping, up, of, the, body, into, 14, pieces, by, set, is, not, recounted, in, this, particular, stela, although, it, is, attested, to, be, a, part, of, the, rituals, by, a, version, of, the, papyrus, jumilhac, in, which, it, took, isis, 12, days, to, reassemble, the, pieces, coinciding, with, the, festival, of, ploughing, some, elements, of, the, ceremony, were, held, in, the, temple, while, others, involved, public, participation, in, a, form, of, theatre, the, stela, of, ikhernofret, recounts, the, programme, of, events, of, the, public, elements, over, the, five, days, of, the, festival, contrasting, with, the, public, theatrical, ceremonies, sourced, from, the, middle, kingdom, ikhernofret, stele, more, esoteric, ceremonies, were, performed, inside, the, temples, by, priests, plutarch, mentions, that, for, much, later, period, two, days, after, the, beginning, of, the, festival, the, priests, bring, forth, a, sacred, chest, containing, a, small, golden, coffer, into, which, they, pour, some, potable, water, and, a, great, shout, arises, from, the, company, for, joy, that, osiris, is, found, or, resurrected, then, they, knead, some, fertile, soil, with, the, water, and, fashion, therefrom, a, crescent, shaped, figure, which, they, cloth, and, adorn, this, indicating, that, they, regard, these, gods, as, the, substance, of, earth, and, water, isis, and, osiris, 39, yet, his, accounts, were, still, obscure, for, he, also, wrote, i, pass, over, the, cutting, of, the, wood, opting, not, to, describe, it, since, he, considered, it, as, a, most, sacred, ritual, ibid, 21, in, the, osirian, temple, at, denderah, an, inscription, translated, by, budge, chapter, xv, osiris, and, the, egyptian, resurrection, describes, in, detail, the, making, of, wheat, paste, models, of, each, dismembered, piece, of, osiris, to, be, sent, out, to, the, town, where, each, piece, is, discovered, by, isis, at, the, temple, of, mendes, figures, of, osiris, were, made, from, wheat, and, paste, placed, in, a, trough, on, the, day, of, the, murder, then, water, was, added, for, several, days, until, finally, the, mixture, was, kneaded, into, a, mold, of, osiris, and, taken, to, the, temple, to, be, buried, the, sacred, grain, for, these, cakes, were, grown, only, in, the, temple, fields, molds, were, made, from, the, wood, of, a, red, tree, in, the, forms, of, the, sixteen, dismembered, parts, of, osiris, the, cakes, of, divine, bread, were, made, from, each, mold, placed, in, a, silver, chest, and, set, near, the, head, of, the, god, with, the, inward, parts, of, osiris, as, described, in, the, book, of, the, dead, xvii, the, idea, of, divine, justice, being, exercised, after, death, for, wrongdoing, during, life, is, first, encountered, during, the, old, kingdom, in, a, sixth, dynasty, tomb, containing, fragments, of, what, would, be, described, later, as, the, negative, confessions, performed, in, front, of, the, 42, assessors, of, ma, at, at, death, a, person, faced, judgment, by, a, tribunal, of, forty, two, divine, judges, if, they, led, a, life, in, conformance, with, the, precepts, of, the, goddess, ma, at, who, represented, truth, and, right, living, the, person, was, welcomed, into, the, kingdom, of, osiris, if, found, guilty, the, person, was, thrown, to, the, soul, eating, demon, ammit, and, did, not, share, in, eternal, life, the, person, who, is, taken, by, the, devourer, is, subject, first, to, terrifying, punishment, and, then, annihilated, these, depictions, of, punishment, may, have, influenced, medieval, perceptions, of, the, inferno, in, hell, via, early, christian, and, coptic, texts, purification, for, those, who, are, considered, justified, may, be, found, in, the, descriptions, of, flame, island, where, they, experience, the, triumph, over, evil, and, rebirth, for, the, damned, complete, destruction, into, a, state, of, non, being, awaits, but, there, is, no, suggestion, of, eternal, torture, during, the, reign, of, seti, i, osiris, was, also, invoked, in, royal, decrees, to, pursue, the, living, when, wrongdoing, was, observed, but, kept, secret, and, not, reported, the, early, ptolemaic, kings, promoted, a, new, god, serapis, who, combined, traits, of, osiris, with, those, of, various, greek, gods, and, was, portrayed, in, a, hellenistic, form, serapis, was, often, treated, as, the, consort, of, isis, and, became, the, patron, deity, of, the, ptolemies, capital, alexandria, serapis, s, origins, are, not, known, some, ancient, authors, claim, the, cult, of, serapis, was, established, at, alexandria, by, alexander, the, great, himself, but, most, who, discuss, the, subject, of, serapis, s, origins, give, a, story, similar, to, that, by, plutarch, writing, about, 400, years, after, the, fact, plutarch, claimed, that, ptolemy, i, established, the, cult, after, dreaming, of, a, colossal, statue, at, sinope, in, anatolia, his, councillors, identified, the, statue, as, the, greek, god, pluto, and, said, that, the, egyptian, name, for, pluto, was, serapis, this, name, may, have, been, a, hellenization, of, osiris, apis, osiris, apis, was, a, patron, deity, of, the, memphite, necropolis, and, the, father, of, the, apis, bull, who, was, worshipped, there, and, texts, from, ptolemaic, times, treat, serapis, as, the, greek, translation, of, osiris, apis, but, little, of, the, early, evidence, for, serapis, s, cult, comes, from, memphis, and, much, of, it, comes, from, the, mediterranean, world, with, no, reference, to, an, egyptian, origin, for, serapis, so, mark, smith, expresses, doubt, that, serapis, originated, as, a, greek, form, of, osiris, apis, s, name, and, leaves, open, the, possibility, that, serapis, originated, outside, egypt, the, cult, of, isis, and, osiris, continued, at, philae, until, at, least, the, 450s, ce, long, after, the, imperial, decrees, of, the, late, 4th, century, that, ordered, the, closing, of, temples, to, pagan, gods, philae, was, the, last, major, ancient, egyptian, temple, to, be, closed
