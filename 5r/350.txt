noah, n, o, appears, as, the, last, of, the, antediluvian, patriarchs, in, the, traditions, of, abrahamic, religions, his, story, appears, in, the, hebrew, bible, book, of, genesis, chapters, 5, 9, the, quran, and, baha, i, writings, noah, is, referenced, in, various, other, books, of, the, bible, including, the, new, testament, and, in, associated, deuterocanonical, books, the, genesis, flood, narrative, is, among, the, best, known, stories, of, the, bible, in, this, account, god, regretted, making, mankind, because, they, filled, the, world, with, evil, noah, then, labored, faithfully, to, build, the, ark, at, god, s, command, ultimately, saving, not, only, his, own, family, but, mankind, itself, and, all, land, animals, from, extinction, during, the, flood, afterwards, god, made, a, covenant, with, noah, and, promised, never, again, to, destroy, earth, s, with, a, flood, noah, is, also, portrayed, as, a, tiller, of, the, soil, and, as, a, drinker, of, wine, after, the, flood, god, commands, noah, and, his, sons, to, be, fruitful, and, multiply, and, replenish, the, earth, tenth, and, final, of, the, pre, flood, antediluvian, patriarchs, son, to, lamech, and, a, mother, whose, name, is, unmentioned, noah, is, 500, years, old, before, his, sons, shem, ham, and, japheth, are, born, the, genesis, flood, narrative, is, encompassed, within, chapters, 6, 9, in, the, book, of, genesis, in, the, bible, the, narrative, indicates, that, god, intended, to, return, the, earth, to, its, pre, creation, state, of, watery, chaos, by, flooding, the, earth, because, of, humanity, s, misdeeds, and, then, remake, it, using, the, microcosm, of, noah, s, ark, thus, the, flood, was, no, ordinary, overflow, but, a, reversal, of, creation, the, narrative, discusses, the, evil, of, mankind, that, moved, god, to, destroy, the, world, by, way, of, the, flood, the, preparation, of, the, ark, for, certain, animals, noah, and, his, family, and, god, s, guarantee, the, noahic, covenant, for, the, continued, existence, of, life, under, the, promise, that, he, would, never, send, another, flood, after, the, flood, noah, offered, burnt, offerings, to, god, god, accepted, the, sacrifice, and, made, a, covenant, with, noah, and, through, him, with, all, mankind, that, he, would, not, waste, the, earth, or, destroy, man, by, another, deluge, and, god, blessed, noah, and, his, sons, and, said, unto, them, be, fruitful, and, multiply, and, replenish, the, earth, as, a, pledge, of, this, gracious, covenant, with, man, and, beast, the, rainbow, was, set, in, the, clouds, ib, viii, 15, 22, ix, 8, 17, two, injunctions, were, laid, upon, noah, while, the, eating, of, animal, food, was, permitted, abstinence, from, blood, was, strictly, enjoined, and, the, shedding, of, the, blood, of, man, by, man, was, made, a, crime, punishable, by, death, at, the, hands, of, man, ib, ix, 3, 6, noah, as, the, last, of, the, extremely, long, lived, antediluvian, patriarchs, died, 350, years, after, the, flood, at, the, age, of, 950, when, terah, was, 128, the, maximum, human, lifespan, as, depicted, by, the, bible, gradually, diminishes, thereafter, from, almost, 1, 000, years, to, the, 120, years, of, moses, after, the, flood, the, bible, says, that, noah, became, a, farmer, and, he, planted, a, vineyard, he, drank, wine, made, from, this, vineyard, and, got, drunk, and, lay, uncovered, within, his, tent, noah, s, son, ham, the, father, of, canaan, saw, his, father, naked, and, told, his, brothers, which, led, to, ham, s, son, canaan, being, cursed, by, noah, as, early, as, the, classical, era, commentators, on, genesis, 9, 20, 21, have, excused, noah, s, excessive, drinking, because, he, was, considered, to, be, the, first, wine, drinker, the, first, person, to, discover, the, effects, of, wine, john, chrysostom, archbishop, of, constantinople, and, a, church, father, wrote, in, the, 4th, century, that, noah, s, behavior, is, defensible, as, the, first, human, to, taste, wine, he, would, not, know, its, effects, through, ignorance, and, inexperience, of, the, proper, amount, to, drink, fell, into, a, drunken, stupor, philo, a, hellenistic, jewish, philosopher, also, excused, noah, by, noting, that, one, can, drink, in, two, different, manners, 1, to, drink, wine, in, excess, a, peculiar, sin, to, the, vicious, evil, man, or, 2, to, partake, of, wine, as, the, wise, man, noah, being, the, latter, in, jewish, tradition, and, rabbinic, literature, on, noah, rabbis, blame, satan, for, the, intoxicating, properties, of, the, wine, in, the, context, of, noah, s, drunkenness, relates, two, facts, 1, noah, became, drunken, and, he, was, uncovered, within, his, tent, and, 2, ham, saw, the, nakedness, of, his, father, and, told, his, two, brethren, without, because, of, its, brevity, and, textual, inconsistencies, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, narrative, is, a, splinter, from, a, more, substantial, tale, a, fuller, account, would, explain, what, exactly, ham, had, done, to, his, father, or, why, noah, directed, a, curse, at, canaan, for, ham, s, misdeed, or, how, noah, realised, what, had, occurred, in, the, field, of, psychological, biblical, criticism, j, h, ellens, and, w, g, rollins, have, analysed, the, unconventional, behavior, that, occurs, between, noah, and, ham, as, revolving, around, sexuality, and, the, exposure, of, genitalia, as, compared, with, other, hebrew, bible, texts, such, as, habakkuk, 2, 15, and, lamentations, 4, 21, other, commentaries, mention, that, uncovering, someone, s, nakedness, could, mean, having, sexual, intercourse, with, that, person, or, that, person, s, spouse, as, quoted, in, leviticus, 18, 7, 8, and, 20, from, this, interpretation, comes, the, speculation, that, ham, was, guilty, of, engaging, in, incest, and, raping, noah, or, his, own, mother, the, latter, interpretation, would, clarify, why, canaan, as, the, product, of, this, illicit, union, was, cursed, by, noah, alternatively, canaan, could, be, the, perpetrator, himself, as, the, bible, describes, the, illicit, deed, being, committed, by, noah, s, youngest, son, with, ham, being, consistently, described, as, the, middle, son, in, other, verses, genesis, 10, sets, forth, the, descendants, of, shem, ham, and, japheth, from, whom, the, nations, branched, out, over, the, earth, after, the, flood, among, japheth, s, descendants, were, the, maritime, nations, 10, 2, 5, ham, s, son, cush, had, a, son, named, nimrod, who, became, the, first, man, of, might, on, earth, a, mighty, hunter, king, in, babylon, and, the, land, of, shinar, 10, 6, 10, from, there, ashur, went, and, built, nineveh, 10, 11, 12, canaan, s, descendants, sidon, heth, the, jebusites, the, amorites, the, girgashites, the, hivites, the, arkites, the, sinites, the, arvadites, the, zemarites, and, the, hamathites, spread, out, from, sidon, as, far, as, gerar, near, gaza, and, as, far, as, sodom, and, gomorrah, 10, 15, 19, among, shem, s, descendants, was, eber, 10, 21, these, genealogies, differ, structurally, from, those, set, out, in, genesis, 5, and, 11, it, has, a, segmented, or, treelike, structure, going, from, one, father, to, many, offspring, it, is, strange, that, the, table, which, assumes, that, the, population, is, distributed, about, the, earth, precedes, the, account, of, the, tower, of, babel, which, says, that, all, the, population, is, in, one, place, before, it, is, dispersed, genesis, 5, 1, 32, transmits, a, genealogy, of, the, sethites, down, to, noah, which, is, taken, from, the, priestly, tradition, a, genealogy, of, the, canites, from, the, jawhistic, tradition, is, found, in, genesis, 4, 17, 26, biblical, scholars, see, these, as, variants, on, one, and, the, same, list, however, if, we, take, the, merged, text, of, genesis, as, a, single, account, we, can, construct, the, following, family, tree, which, has, come, down, in, this, form, into, the, jewish, and, christian, traditions, according, to, the, documentary, hypothesis, the, first, five, books, of, the, bible, pentateuch, torah, including, genesis, were, collated, during, the, 5th, century, bc, from, four, main, sources, which, themselves, date, from, no, earlier, than, the, 10th, century, bc, two, of, these, the, jahwist, composed, in, the, 10th, century, bc, and, the, priestly, source, from, the, late, 7th, century, bc, make, up, the, chapters, of, genesis, which, concern, noah, the, attempt, by, the, 5th, century, editor, to, accommodate, two, independent, and, sometimes, conflicting, sources, accounts, for, the, confusion, over, such, matters, as, how, many, of, each, animal, noah, took, and, how, long, the, flood, lasted, the, oxford, encyclopedia, of, the, books, of, the, bible, notes, that, this, story, echoes, parts, of, the, garden, of, eden, story, noah, is, the, first, vintner, while, adam, is, the, first, farmer, both, have, problems, with, their, produce, both, stories, involve, nakedness, and, both, involve, a, division, between, brothers, leading, to, a, curse, however, after, the, flood, the, stories, differ, it, is, noah, not, god, who, plants, the, vineyard, and, utters, the, curse, so, god, is, less, involved, in, addition, to, the, main, story, in, genesis, the, hebrew, bible, christian, old, testament, also, refers, to, noah, in, the, first, book, of, chronicles, isaiah, and, ezekiel, references, in, the, deuterocanonical, books, include, the, books, of, tobit, wisdom, sirach, 2, esdras, and, 4, maccabees, new, testament, references, include, the, gospels, of, matthew, and, luke, and, some, of, the, epistles, epistle, to, the, hebrews, 1, peter, and, 2, peter, noah, became, the, subject, of, much, elaboration, in, the, literature, of, later, abrahamic, religions, including, islam, surahs, 71, 7, 11, 54, and, 21, of, the, quran, and, the, bah, faith, kit, b, i, q, n, and, gems, of, divine, mysteries, the, book, of, jubilees, refers, to, noah, and, says, that, he, was, taught, the, arts, of, healing, by, an, angel, so, that, his, children, could, overcome, the, offspring, of, the, watchers, in, 10, 1, 3, of, the, book, of, enoch, which, is, part, of, the, orthodox, tewahedo, biblical, canon, and, canonical, for, beta, israel, uriel, was, dispatched, by, the, most, high, to, inform, noah, of, the, approaching, deluge, there, are, 20, or, so, fragments, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, that, appear, to, refer, to, noah, lawrence, schiffman, writes, among, the, dead, sea, scrolls, at, least, three, different, versions, of, this, legend, are, preserved, in, particular, the, genesis, apocryphon, devotes, considerable, space, to, noah, however, the, material, seems, to, have, little, in, common, with, genesis, 5, which, reports, the, birth, of, noah, also, noah, s, father, is, reported, as, worrying, that, his, son, was, actually, fathered, by, one, of, the, watchers, the, righteousness, of, noah, is, the, subject, of, much, discussion, among, rabbis, the, description, of, noah, as, righteous, in, his, generation, implied, to, some, that, his, perfection, was, only, relative, in, his, generation, of, wicked, people, he, could, be, considered, righteous, but, in, the, generation, of, a, tzadik, like, abraham, he, would, not, be, considered, so, righteous, they, point, out, that, noah, did, not, pray, to, god, on, behalf, of, those, about, to, be, destroyed, as, abraham, prayed, for, the, wicked, of, sodom, and, gomorrah, in, fact, noah, is, never, seen, to, speak, he, simply, listens, to, god, and, acts, on, his, orders, this, led, some, commentators, to, offer, the, figure, of, noah, as, the, righteous, man, in, a, fur, coat, who, ensured, his, own, comfort, while, ignoring, his, neighbour, others, such, as, the, medieval, commentator, rashi, held, on, the, contrary, that, the, building, of, the, ark, was, stretched, over, 120, years, deliberately, in, order, to, give, sinners, time, to, repent, rashi, interprets, his, father, s, statement, of, the, naming, of, noah, in, hebrew, noa, this, one, will, comfort, us, in, hebrew, yena, amenu, in, our, work, and, in, the, toil, of, our, hands, which, come, from, the, ground, that, the, lord, had, cursed, by, saying, noah, heralded, a, new, era, of, prosperity, when, there, was, easing, in, hebrew, na, ah, from, the, curse, from, the, time, of, adam, when, the, earth, produced, thorns, and, thistles, even, where, men, sowed, wheat, and, that, noah, then, introduced, the, plow, according, to, the, jewish, encyclopedia, the, book, of, genesis, contains, two, accounts, of, noah, in, the, first, noah, is, the, hero, of, the, flood, and, in, the, second, he, is, the, father, of, mankind, and, a, husbandman, who, planted, the, first, vineyard, the, disparity, of, character, between, these, two, narratives, has, caused, some, critics, to, insist, that, the, subject, of, the, latter, account, was, not, the, same, as, the, subject, of, the, former, the, encyclopedia, judaica, notes, that, noah, s, drunkenness, is, not, presented, as, reprehensible, behavior, rather, it, is, clear, that, noah, s, venture, into, viticulture, provides, the, setting, for, the, castigation, of, israel, s, canaanite, neighbors, it, was, ham, who, committed, an, offense, when, he, viewed, his, father, s, nakedness, yet, noah, s, curse, is, strangely, aimed, at, canaan, rather, than, the, disrespectful, ham, in, mandaeism, noah, classical, mandaic, is, mentioned, in, book, 18, of, the, right, ginza, in, the, text, noah, s, wife, is, named, as, nuraita, classical, mandaic, while, his, son, is, named, as, shum, i, e, shem, classical, mandaic, 2, peter, 2, 5, refers, to, noah, as, a, preacher, of, righteousness, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, and, the, gospel, of, luke, jesus, compares, noah, s, flood, with, the, coming, day, of, judgement, just, as, it, was, in, the, days, of, noah, so, too, it, will, be, in, the, days, of, the, coming, of, the, son, of, man, for, in, the, days, before, the, flood, people, were, eating, and, drinking, marrying, and, giving, in, marriage, up, to, the, day, noah, entered, the, ark, and, they, knew, nothing, about, what, would, happen, until, the, flood, came, and, took, them, all, away, that, is, how, it, will, be, at, the, coming, of, the, son, of, man, the, first, epistle, of, peter, compares, the, power, of, baptism, with, the, ark, saving, those, who, were, in, it, in, later, christian, thought, the, ark, came, to, be, compared, to, the, church, salvation, was, to, be, found, only, within, christ, and, his, lordship, as, in, noah, s, time, it, had, been, found, only, within, the, ark, st, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, demonstrated, in, the, city, of, god, that, the, dimensions, of, the, ark, corresponded, to, the, dimensions, of, the, human, body, which, corresponds, to, the, body, of, christ, the, equation, of, ark, and, church, is, still, found, in, the, anglican, rite, of, baptism, which, asks, god, who, of, thy, great, mercy, didst, save, noah, to, receive, into, the, church, the, infant, about, to, be, baptised, in, medieval, christianity, noah, s, three, sons, were, generally, considered, as, the, founders, of, the, populations, of, the, three, known, continents, japheth, europe, shem, asia, and, ham, africa, although, a, rarer, variation, held, that, they, represented, the, three, classes, of, medieval, society, the, priests, shem, the, warriors, japheth, and, the, peasants, ham, in, medieval, christian, thought, ham, was, considered, to, be, the, ancestor, of, the, people, of, black, africa, so, in, racialist, arguments, the, curse, of, ham, became, a, justification, for, the, slavery, of, the, black, races, isaac, newton, in, his, religious, works, on, the, development, of, religion, wrote, about, noah, and, his, offspring, in, newton, s, view, while, noah, was, a, monotheist, the, gods, of, pagan, antiquity, are, identified, with, noah, and, his, descendants, an, important, gnostic, text, the, apocryphon, of, john, reports, that, the, chief, archon, caused, the, flood, because, he, desired, to, destroy, the, world, he, had, made, but, the, first, thought, informed, noah, of, the, chief, archon, s, plans, and, noah, informed, the, remainder, of, humanity, unlike, the, account, of, genesis, not, only, are, noah, s, family, saved, but, many, others, also, heed, noah, s, call, there, is, no, ark, in, this, account, according, to, elaine, pagels, rather, they, hid, in, a, particular, place, not, only, noah, but, also, many, other, people, from, the, unshakable, race, they, entered, that, place, and, hid, in, a, bright, cloud, the, druze, regard, noah, as, the, second, spokesman, natiq, after, adam, who, helped, transmit, the, foundational, teachings, of, monotheism, tawhid, intended, for, the, larger, audience, he, is, considered, an, important, prophet, of, god, among, druze, being, among, the, seven, prophets, who, appeared, in, different, periods, of, history, noah, is, a, highly, important, figure, in, islam, and, he, is, seen, as, one, of, the, most, significant, of, all, prophets, the, quran, contains, 43, references, to, noah, or, nu, in, 28, chapters, and, the, seventy, first, chapter, s, rah, n, arabic, is, named, after, him, his, life, is, also, spoken, of, in, the, commentaries, and, in, islamic, legends, noah, s, narratives, largely, cover, his, preaching, as, well, the, story, of, the, deluge, noah, s, narrative, sets, the, prototype, for, many, of, the, subsequent, prophetic, stories, which, begin, with, the, prophet, warning, his, people, and, then, the, community, rejecting, the, message, and, facing, a, punishment, noah, has, several, titles, in, islam, based, primarily, on, praise, for, him, in, the, quran, including, trustworthy, messenger, of, god, 26, 107, and, grateful, servant, of, god, 17, 3, the, quran, focuses, on, several, instances, from, noah, s, life, more, than, others, and, one, of, the, most, significant, events, is, the, flood, god, makes, a, covenant, with, noah, just, as, he, did, with, abraham, moses, jesus, and, muhammad, later, on, 33, 7, noah, is, later, reviled, by, his, people, and, reproached, by, them, for, being, a, mere, human, messenger, and, not, an, angel, 10, 72, 74, moreover, the, people, mock, noah, s, words, and, call, him, a, liar, 7, 62, and, they, even, suggest, that, noah, is, possessed, by, a, devil, when, the, prophet, ceases, to, preach, 54, 9, only, the, lowest, of, classes, in, the, community, join, noah, in, believing, in, god, s, message, 11, 29, and, noah, s, narrative, further, describes, him, preaching, both, in, private, and, public, the, quran, narrates, that, noah, received, a, revelation, to, build, an, ark, after, his, people, refused, to, believe, in, his, message, and, hear, the, warning, the, narrative, goes, on, to, describe, that, waters, poured, forth, from, both, the, earth, and, the, heavens, destroying, all, the, sinners, even, one, of, his, sons, disbelieved, him, stayed, behind, and, was, drowned, after, the, flood, ended, the, ark, rested, atop, mount, judi, quran, 11, 44, also, islamic, beliefs, deny, the, idea, of, noah, being, the, first, person, to, drink, wine, and, experience, the, aftereffects, of, doing, so, quran, 29, 14, states, that, noah, had, been, living, among, the, people, who, he, was, sent, to, for, 950, years, when, the, flood, started, indeed, we, sent, noah, to, his, people, and, he, remained, among, them, for, a, thousand, years, less, fifty, then, the, flood, overtook, them, while, they, persisted, in, wrongdoing, the, bah, faith, regards, the, ark, and, the, flood, as, symbolic, in, bah, belief, only, noah, s, followers, were, spiritually, alive, preserved, in, the, ark, of, his, teachings, as, others, were, spiritually, dead, the, bah, scripture, kit, b, i, q, n, endorses, the, islamic, belief, that, noah, had, a, large, number, of, companions, either, 40, or, 72, besides, his, family, on, the, ark, and, that, he, taught, for, 950, symbolic, years, before, the, flood, according, to, the, ahmadiyya, understanding, of, the, quran, the, period, described, in, the, quran, is, the, age, of, his, dispensation, which, extended, until, the, time, of, ibrahim, abraham, 950, years, the, first, 50, years, were, the, years, of, spiritual, progress, which, were, followed, by, 900, years, of, spiritual, deterioration, of, the, people, of, noah, indian, and, greek, flood, myths, also, exist, although, there, is, little, evidence, that, they, were, derived, from, the, mesopotamian, flood, myth, that, underlies, the, biblical, account, the, noah, story, of, the, pentateuch, is, quite, similar, to, a, flood, story, contained, in, the, mesopotamian, epic, of, gilgamesh, composed, c, 1800, bce, in, the, gilgamesh, version, the, mesopotamian, gods, decide, to, send, a, great, flood, to, destroy, mankind, various, correlations, between, the, stories, of, noah, and, gilgamesh, the, flood, the, construction, of, the, ark, the, salvation, of, animals, and, the, release, of, birds, following, the, flood, have, led, to, this, story, being, seen, as, the, source, for, the, story, of, noah, the, few, variations, include, the, number, of, days, of, the, deluge, the, order, of, the, birds, and, the, name, of, the, mountain, on, which, the, ark, rests, the, flood, story, in, genesis, 6, 8, matches, the, gilgamesh, flood, myth, so, closely, that, few, doubt, that, derives, from, a, mesopotamian, account, what, is, particularly, noticeable, is, the, way, the, genesis, flood, story, follows, the, gilgamesh, flood, tale, point, by, point, and, in, the, same, order, even, when, the, story, permits, other, alternatives, the, earliest, written, flood, myth, is, found, in, the, mesopotamian, epic, of, atrahasis, and, epic, of, gilgamesh, texts, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, says, these, mythologies, are, the, source, of, such, features, of, the, biblical, flood, story, as, the, building, and, provisioning, of, the, ark, its, flotation, and, the, subsidence, of, the, waters, as, well, as, the, part, played, by, the, human, protagonist, the, encyclopedia, judaica, adds, that, there, is, a, strong, suggestion, that, an, intermediate, agent, was, active, the, people, most, likely, to, have, fulfilled, this, role, are, the, hurrians, whose, territory, included, the, city, of, harran, where, the, patriarch, abraham, had, his, roots, the, hurrians, inherited, the, flood, story, from, babylonia, the, encyclopedia, mentions, another, similarity, between, the, stories, noah, is, the, tenth, patriarch, and, berossus, notes, that, the, hero, of, the, great, flood, was, babylonia, s, tenth, antediluvian, king, however, there, is, a, discrepancy, in, the, ages, of, the, heroes, for, the, mesopotamian, antecedents, the, reigns, of, the, antediluvian, kings, range, from, 18, 600, to, nearly, 65, 000, years, in, the, bible, the, lifespans, fall, far, short, of, the, briefest, reign, mentioned, in, the, related, mesopotamian, texts, also, the, name, of, the, hero, differs, between, the, traditions, the, earliest, mesopotamian, flood, account, written, in, the, sumerian, language, calls, the, deluge, hero, ziusudra, however, yi, samuel, chen, writes, that, the, oldest, versions, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, never, mentioned, the, flood, just, mentioning, that, he, went, to, talk, to, utnapishtim, to, find, the, secret, of, immortality, starting, with, the, old, babylonian, period, there, were, attempts, to, syncretize, utnapishtim, with, ziusudra, even, though, they, were, previously, seen, as, different, figures, gilgamesh, meeting, the, flood, hero, was, first, alluded, to, in, the, old, babylonian, period, in, the, death, of, gilgamesh, and, eventually, was, imported, and, standardized, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, probably, in, the, middle, babylonian, period, gilgamesh, s, historical, reign, is, believed, to, have, been, approximately, 2700, bc, shortly, before, the, earliest, known, written, stories, the, discovery, of, artifacts, associated, with, aga, and, enmebaragesi, of, kish, two, other, kings, named, in, the, stories, has, lent, credibility, to, the, historical, existence, of, gilgamesh, the, earliest, sumerian, gilgamesh, poems, date, from, as, early, as, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, 2100, 2000, bc, one, of, these, poems, mentions, gilgamesh, s, journey, to, meet, the, flood, hero, as, well, as, a, short, version, of, the, flood, story, although, chen, writes, that, his, was, included, in, texts, written, during, the, old, babylonian, period, the, earliest, akkadian, versions, of, the, unified, epic, are, dated, to, c, 2000, 1700, bc, due, to, the, fragmentary, nature, of, these, old, babylonian, versions, it, is, unclear, whether, they, included, an, expanded, account, of, the, flood, myth, although, one, fragment, definitely, includes, the, story, of, gilgamesh, s, journey, to, meet, utnapishtim, the, standard, akkadian, version, included, a, long, version, of, the, flood, story, and, was, edited, by, sin, liqe, unninni, sometime, between, 1300, and, 1000, bc, yi, samuel, chen, analyzing, various, texts, from, the, early, dynastic, iii, period, to, the, old, babylonian, period, argues, that, the, flood, narrative, was, only, added, in, texts, written, during, the, latter, old, babylonian, period, observations, by, experts, indicate, that, the, portions, of, the, sumerian, king, list, which, mention, the, time, before, the, flood, are, stylistically, different, from, the, king, list, proper, chen, writes, that, old, babylonian, copies, tend, to, show, a, separate, pre, flood, tradition, which, is, apart, from, the, king, list, further, the, ur, iii, copy, of, the, king, list, as, well, as, similar, documents, indicate, that, the, king, list, proper, once, existed, independent, of, a, flood, narrative, or, a, pre, flood, tradition, chen, provides, evidence, that, the, sections, of, the, sumerian, king, list, that, mention, references, to, the, flood, were, all, later, additions, added, during, the, old, babylonian, period, through, later, updates, and, edits, the, flood, as, a, watershed, in, early, history, of, the, world, was, probably, a, new, historiographical, concept, emerging, in, the, mesopotamian, literary, traditions, during, the, old, babylonian, period, as, evident, by, the, fact, that, the, flood, motif, didn, t, show, up, in, the, ur, iii, copy, and, that, the, earliest, chronographical, sources, related, to, the, flood, show, up, in, the, old, babylonian, period, chen, concludes, that, the, name, of, ziusudra, as, a, flood, hero, as, well, as, any, hinted, references, of, a, flood, in, the, old, babylonian, version, of, the, instructions, of, shuruppak, were, later, developments, during, the, old, babylonian, period, originating, from, updated, information, added, to, the, text, from, the, burgeoning, antediluvian, tradition, noah, has, often, been, compared, to, deucalion, the, son, of, prometheus, and, pronoia, in, greek, mythology, like, noah, deucalion, is, warned, of, the, flood, by, zeus, and, poseidon, he, builds, an, ark, and, staffs, it, with, creatures, and, when, he, completes, his, voyage, gives, thanks, and, takes, advice, from, the, gods, on, how, to, repopulate, the, earth, deucalion, also, sends, a, pigeon, to, find, out, about, the, situation, of, the, world, and, the, bird, returns, with, an, olive, branch, deucalion, in, some, versions, of, the, myth, also, becomes, the, inventor, of, wine, like, noah, philo, and, justin, equate, deucalion, with, noah, and, josephus, used, the, story, of, deucalion, as, evidence, that, the, flood, actually, occurred, and, that, therefore, noah, existed, the, motif, of, a, weather, deity, who, headed, the, pantheon, causing, the, great, flood, and, then, the, trickster, who, created, men, from, clay, saving, man, is, also, present, in, sumerian, mythology, as, enlil, instead, of, zeus, causes, the, flood, and, enki, rather, than, prometheus, saves, man, stephanie, west, has, written, that, this, is, perhaps, due, to, the, greeks, borrowing, stories, from, the, near, east
