secularism, is, the, principle, of, seeking, to, conduct, human, affairs, based, on, naturalistic, considerations, uninvolved, with, religion, secularism, is, most, commonly, thought, of, as, the, separation, of, religion, from, civil, affairs, and, the, state, and, may, be, broadened, to, a, similar, position, seeking, to, remove, or, to, minimize, the, role, of, religion, in, any, public, sphere, the, term, secularism, has, a, broad, range, of, meanings, and, in, the, most, schematic, may, encapsulate, any, stance, that, promotes, the, secular, in, any, given, context, it, may, connote, anti, clericalism, atheism, naturalism, non, sectarianism, neutrality, on, topics, of, religion, or, antireligion, secularism, can, be, also, defined, as, treating, every, religion, equally, and, providing, equal, facility, as, a, philosophy, secularism, seeks, to, interpret, life, based, on, principles, derived, solely, from, the, material, world, without, recourse, to, religion, it, shifts, the, focus, from, religion, towards, temporal, and, material, concerns, there, are, distinct, traditions, of, secularism, in, the, west, like, the, french, benelux, german, turkish, and, american, models, and, beyond, as, in, india, where, the, emphasis, is, more, on, equality, before, law, and, state, neutrality, and, equidistance, from, all, religions, rather, than, a, complete, blanket, separation, the, latter, in, the, case, of, india, is, termed, as, interventionist, secularism, wherein, the, state, intervenes, to, abolish, practices, of, religion, which, it, considers, against, constitutional, principles, although, this, equidistance, has, been, constitutionally, understood, to, not, exclude, the, concept, of, a, god, the, purposes, and, arguments, in, support, of, secularism, vary, widely, ranging, from, assertions, that, it, is, a, crucial, element, of, modernization, or, that, religion, and, traditional, values, are, backward, and, divisive, to, the, claim, that, it, is, the, only, guarantor, of, free, religious, exercise, secularism, takes, different, forms, with, varying, stances, on, where, and, how, religion, should, be, separate, from, other, aspects, of, society, people, of, any, religious, denomination, can, support, a, secular, society, or, adopt, the, principles, of, secularism, although, secularist, identity, is, often, associated, with, non, religious, individuals, such, as, atheists, political, secularism, encompasses, the, schools, of, thought, in, secularism, that, consider, the, regulation, of, religion, by, a, secular, state, religious, minorities, and, non, religious, citizens, in, a, country, tend, to, support, political, secularism, while, members, of, the, majority, religion, tend, to, oppose, it, secular, nationalists, are, people, that, support, political, secularism, within, their, own, state, scholars, identify, several, variations, of, political, secularism, in, society, the, strictest, form, associated, with, the, french, laique, model, advocates, a, state, that, is, both, firmly, and, officially, distanced, from, all, religions, and, non, religious, philosophical, convictions, in, all, of, its, manifestations, and, official, dealings, without, exception, a, more, humanistic, form, is, indifferent, towards, religions, per, se, but, also, advocates, for, the, states, to, operate, on, purely, a, rational, basis, of, evidence, based, policy, and, a, focus, on, human, needs, and, welfare, entailing, non, discrimination, between, peoples, of, differing, religions, and, non, religious, philosophical, convictions, throughout, society, a, third, liberal, or, pillarized, form, of, secularism, holds, that, governments, may, in, some, instances, express, sympathy, to, provide, funding, to, licence, state, services, to, or, otherwise, allow, unique, special, treatment, of, religions, common, in, german, speaking, and, benelux, secular, states, so, long, as, states, nevertheless, treat, these, convictions, equally, and, are, neither, hostile, nor, preferential, towards, any, particular, set, of, religious, or, non, religious, philosophical, convictions, such, as, humanists, in, these, countries, secular, humanist, organizations, typically, receive, state, funding, according, to, the, same, funding, formulas, used, to, provide, state, funding, to, religious, groups, in, indian, political, discourse, the, pejorative, term, pseudo, secularism, is, also, used, to, highlight, instances, where, it, is, believed, that, while, the, state, purports, to, be, secular, indifferent, or, impartial, towards, religions, its, policies, in, reality, favour, a, particular, religion, over, others, there, are, many, principles, that, are, associated, with, all, forms, of, political, secularism, it, typically, promotes, legal, equality, between, people, of, different, religions, opposing, a, legal, hierarchy, on, the, basis, of, religious, belief, or, lack, of, religious, belief, it, is, also, associated, with, a, separation, of, church, and, state, considering, these, to, be, two, distinct, entities, that, should, be, treated, separately, state, supremacy, is, a, secular, principle, that, supports, obedience, to, the, rule, of, law, over, religious, diktat, or, canon, law, while, internal, constraint, is, a, secular, principle, that, opposes, governmental, control, over, one, s, personal, life, under, political, secularism, the, government, can, enforce, how, people, act, but, not, what, they, believe, similarly, freedom, of, thought, is, supported, by, secularism, order, is, supported, by, secularists, specifically, in, that, one, s, beliefs, should, not, be, permitted, to, disturb, the, civil, peace, religious, tolerance, is, supported, both, for, people, of, other, religions, and, for, a, lack, of, piety, demonstrated, by, members, of, one, s, own, religion, political, secularism, also, supports, reason, as, a, virtue, secularists, also, support, freedom, from, religion, as, an, extension, to, freedom, of, religion, secularism, in, practice, has, existed, since, ancient, times, in, societies, such, as, ancient, greece, a, limited, secularism, was, practised, in, which, religion, was, not, involved, in, governance, though, it, was, still, prevalent, in, public, life, in, europe, secularism, emerged, in, the, early, modern, period, due, to, functional, differentiation, religion, changed, from, being, the, predominant, lens, through, which, reality, was, interpreted, to, providing, only, an, alternative, explanatory, approach, in, 1636, roger, williams, founded, the, providence, plantations, as, a, settlement, with, total, freedom, of, religion, in, present, day, rhode, island, secular, ideas, were, strongly, challenged, by, religious, leaders, and, the, catholic, church, in, particular, causing, a, religious, culture, war, during, the, american, revolution, thomas, jefferson, and, james, madison, incorporated, the, ideas, of, john, locke, into, the, government, of, the, united, states, including, his, secularism, though, a, true, secular, state, was, not, achieved, until, the, 20th, century, french, secularism, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, was, based, on, gallicanism, which, emphasised, state, supremacy, as, well, as, anti, clericalism, and, materialism, revolutionary, france, opposed, catholic, influence, in, the, country, and, it, briefly, replaced, christianity, with, the, deistic, cult, of, reason, the, first, to, use, the, already, extant, word, secularism, in, a, modern, sense, was, the, british, agnostic, writer, george, holyoake, in, 1851, finding, atheism, too, aggravating, he, sought, a, term, that, would, describe, a, stance, advocating, to, conduct, life, based, on, naturalistic, secular, considerations, only, but, without, necessarily, rejecting, religion, thus, enabling, cooperation, with, believers, holyoake, s, definition, of, secularism, differs, from, its, usage, by, later, writers, as, the, humanist, heritage, website, notes, holyoake, provides, a, definition, of, secularism, much, akin, to, modern, definitions, of, humanism, broader, than, just, atheism, more, modern, definitions, of, secularism, are, likely, to, pertain, to, separation, of, church, and, state, rather, than, personal, beliefs, many, christian, countries, began, to, undergo, societal, secularisation, during, the, 20th, century, with, levels, of, belief, and, practice, declining, sociologists, disagree, as, to, whether, this, represents, a, periodic, fluctuation, or, a, larger, trend, toward, long, term, adoption, of, secularism, the, principle, of, la, cit, the, french, notion, of, strict, separation, was, enshrined, into, law, in, 1905, after, the, rise, to, power, of, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, in, 1923, turkish, secularism, or, laiklik, became, a, state, ideology, under, kemalism, aiming, to, modernise, the, country, turkey, s, secular, tradition, prior, to, atat, rk, s, reforms, was, limited, and, 20th, century, turkish, secularism, was, initially, modelled, after, french, la, cit, turkey, remains, virtually, the, only, muslim, majority, nation, with, an, effective, secular, government, though, secularism, remains, a, controversial, ideology, in, turkey, and, the, country, s, ruling, party, akp, is, more, anti, kemalist, than, anti, secularist, india, became, a, secular, state, after, it, achieved, independence, in, 1947, mahatma, gandhi, supported, pluralist, secularism, as, a, means, to, curb, tensions, in, the, religiously, diverse, nation, the, indian, model, of, secularism, stressed, equality, of, citizens, regardless, of, faith, before, the, law, along, with, some, separation, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, was, proclaimed, in, 1948, protecting, freedom, of, religion, in, international, law, in, political, terms, secularism, is, a, movement, towards, the, separation, of, religion, and, government, often, termed, the, separation, of, church, and, state, this, can, refer, to, reducing, ties, between, a, government, and, a, state, religion, replacing, laws, based, on, scripture, such, as, halakha, dharma, stra, and, sharia, with, civil, laws, and, eliminating, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, religion, this, is, said, to, add, to, democracy, by, protecting, the, rights, of, religious, minorities, separation, of, church, and, state, is, one, possible, strategy, to, be, deployed, by, secular, governments, from, the, democratic, to, the, authoritarian, such, governments, share, a, concern, to, limit, the, religious, side, in, the, relationship, each, state, may, find, its, own, unique, policy, prescriptions, these, may, include, separation, careful, monitoring, and, regulation, of, organized, religion, such, as, in, france, turkey, india, and, others, in, accord, with, the, belief, in, the, separation, of, church, and, state, secularists, tend, to, prefer, that, politicians, make, decisions, for, secular, rather, than, religious, reasons, in, this, respect, policy, decisions, pertaining, to, topics, like, abortion, contraception, embryonic, stem, cell, research, same, sex, marriage, and, sex, education, are, prominently, focused, upon, by, american, secularist, organizations, such, as, the, center, for, inquiry, religious, fundamentalists, often, oppose, a, secular, form, of, government, arguing, that, it, contradicts, the, character, of, historically, religious, nations, or, infringes, on, their, rights, to, express, themselves, in, the, public, sphere, in, the, united, states, for, example, the, word, secularism, became, equivalent, to, anti, religion, due, to, such, efforts, religious, minorities, however, often, support, secularism, as, a, means, of, defending, their, rights, against, the, majority, state, secularism, is, most, often, associated, with, the, age, of, enlightenment, in, europe, and, it, plays, a, major, role, in, western, society, some, of, the, most, well, known, examples, for, states, considered, constitutionally, secular, are, the, united, states, france, turkey, india, mexico, and, south, korea, though, none, of, these, nations, have, identical, forms, of, governance, with, respect, to, religion, for, example, in, india, secularism, does, not, completely, separate, state, and, religion, while, in, france, secularism, precludes, such, mutual, involvement, separationist, secularism, enforces, the, separation, of, church, and, state, under, this, system, the, state, does, not, support, any, religious, group, and, does, not, enforce, religious, laws, challenges, facing, separationist, secularism, include, how, the, government, should, regulate, secular, activities, of, religious, groups, and, how, to, govern, separately, from, religion, when, citizens, including, government, employees, are, religious, the, federal, judiciary, of, the, united, states, interpreted, the, united, states, constitution, as, supporting, this, system, during, the, 20th, century, based, on, the, ideas, of, john, locke, and, thomas, jefferson, la, cit, is, a, secularist, framework, developed, and, used, in, france, under, this, system, the, state, has, legal, supremacy, over, religion, and, enforces, the, restriction, of, religion, in, the, public, sphere, it, was, established, by, a, 1905, law, and, subsequent, laws, have, restricted, the, use, of, religious, iconography, in, public, or, by, children, kemalist, secularism, or, laiklik, is, an, adaptation, of, la, cit, that, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, established, in, turkey, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, accommodationism, is, a, system, of, actively, supporting, religion, in, general, without, favouring, a, specific, religious, sect, under, this, system, the, state, applies, few, restrictions, to, religion, and, often, provides, religious, organizations, with, financial, support, india, uses, this, system, incorporating, western, ideas, of, secularism, in, combination, with, the, indian, tradition, of, religious, and, ethnic, pluralism, one, source, of, disagreement, regarding, accommodationism, in, india, is, the, right, of, muslims, to, live, under, both, the, civil, code, and, sharia, simultaneously, and, the, complications, that, result, from, this, accommodationism, also, has, a, history, in, the, united, states, and, the, u, s, has, increasingly, moved, toward, accommodationism, in, the, 21st, century, state, atheism, is, a, total, ban, on, religion, under, this, system, the, state, enforces, laws, that, do, not, allow, religious, practice, or, the, expression, of, religious, beliefs, in, society, unlike, other, secularist, frameworks, state, atheism, does, not, permit, freedom, of, thought, or, the, separation, of, government, from, personal, belief, because, of, this, distinction, state, atheism, may, or, may, not, be, considered, a, form, of, secularism, it, is, typically, associated, with, marxism, and, communist, states, in, which, it, is, described, as, scientific, atheism, in, studies, of, religion, modern, democracies, are, generally, recognized, as, secular, this, is, due, to, the, near, complete, freedom, of, religion, religious, beliefs, generally, are, not, subject, to, legal, or, social, sanctions, and, the, lack, of, authority, of, religious, leaders, over, political, decisions, nevertheless, it, has, been, claimed, that, surveys, done, by, pew, research, center, show, americans, as, generally, being, more, comfortable, with, religion, playing, a, major, role, in, public, life, while, in, europe, the, impact, of, the, church, on, public, life, is, declining, most, societies, become, increasingly, secular, as, the, result, of, social, economic, development, and, progress, rather, than, through, the, actions, of, a, dedicated, secular, movement, modern, sociology, has, since, max, weber, often, been, preoccupied, with, the, problem, of, authority, in, secularised, societies, and, with, secularisation, as, a, sociological, or, historical, process, contemporary, ethical, debate, in, the, west, is, often, described, as, secular, as, it, is, detached, from, religious, considerations, twentieth, century, scholars, whose, work, has, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, these, matters, include, carl, l, becker, karl, l, with, hans, blumenberg, m, h, abrams, peter, l, berger, paul, b, nichou, and, d, l, munby, among, others, there, is, not, one, singular, secular, culture, as, different, people, identify, as, secularists, for, different, reasons, and, under, different, belief, systems, secularism, is, typically, associated, with, progressivism, and, social, liberalism, in, democratic, countries, middle, and, upper, class, white, urban, males, with, high, education, are, more, likely, to, identify, as, secularist, than, any, other, demographic, group, in, societies, where, secularism, is, more, common, such, as, in, western, europe, demographics, of, secularists, are, closer, to, even, how, a, society, considers, what, is, secular, may, also, change, where, nominally, spiritual, beliefs, become, part, of, public, or, private, life, without, being, recognized, as, religious, as, secularists, are, a, minority, in, most, communities, secularism, is, often, stigmatized, proponents, of, religious, society, challenge, secular, society, on, the, basis, of, morality, saying, that, secularism, lacks, a, meaningful, way, to, incentivize, moral, behaviour, among, its, members, secularism, is, considered, in, political, philosophy, and, philosophy, of, religion, as, a, philosophy, secularism, is, closely, associated, with, naturalism, and, materialism, rejecting, consideration, of, immaterial, or, supernatural, substances, such, as, a, soul, in, favour, of, a, material, universe, this, secular, materialism, and, rationalism, forms, the, basis, of, most, modern, empirical, science, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, liberal, european, philosophers, such, as, baruch, spinoza, john, locke, montesquieu, voltaire, david, hume, adam, smith, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, all, proposed, various, forms, of, separation, of, church, and, state, the, work, of, well, known, moral, philosophers, such, as, derek, parfit, and, peter, singer, and, even, the, whole, field, of, contemporary, bioethics, have, been, described, as, explicitly, secular, or, non, religious, a, major, issue, considered, by, secular, philosophy, is, the, nature, of, morality, in, a, material, universe, secular, ethics, and, secular, morality, describe, systems, of, right, and, wrong, that, do, not, depend, on, religious, or, supernatural, concepts, much, of, the, philosophy, of, friedrich, nietzsche, is, developed, in, response, to, this, issue, under, secular, ethics, good, is, typically, defined, as, that, which, contributes, to, human, flourishing, and, justice, rather, than, an, abstract, or, idealized, conception, of, good, secular, ethics, are, often, considered, within, the, frame, of, humanism, it, can, be, seen, by, many, of, the, organizations, ngos, for, secularism, that, they, prefer, to, define, secularism, as, the, common, ground, for, all, life, stance, groups, religious, or, atheistic, to, thrive, in, a, society, that, honours, freedom, of, speech, and, conscience, an, example, of, that, is, the, national, secular, society, in, the, uk, this, is, a, common, understanding, of, what, secularism, stands, for, among, many, of, its, activists, throughout, the, world, however, many, scholars, of, christianity, and, conservative, politicians, seem, to, interpret, secularism, more, often, than, not, as, an, antithesis, of, religion, and, an, attempt, to, push, religion, out, of, society, and, replace, it, with, atheism, or, a, void, of, values, nihilism, this, dual, aspect, as, noted, above, in, secular, ethics, has, created, difficulties, in, political, discourse, on, the, subject, it, seems, that, most, political, theorists, in, philosophy, following, the, landmark, work, of, john, rawls, a, theory, of, justice, in, 1971, and, its, following, book, political, liberalism, 1993, would, rather, use, the, conjoined, concept, overlapping, consensus, rather, than, secularism, in, the, latter, rawls, holds, the, idea, of, an, overlapping, consensus, as, one, of, three, main, ideas, of, political, liberalism, he, argues, that, the, term, secularism, cannot, apply, but, what, is, a, secular, argument, some, think, of, any, argument, that, is, reflective, and, critical, publicly, intelligible, and, rational, as, a, secular, argument, nevertheless, a, central, feature, of, political, liberalism, is, that, it, views, all, such, arguments, the, same, way, it, views, religious, ones, and, therefore, these, secular, philosophical, doctrines, do, not, provide, public, reasons, secular, concepts, and, reasoning, of, this, kind, belong, to, first, philosophy, and, moral, doctrine, and, fall, outside, the, domain, of, the, political, still, rawl, s, theory, is, akin, to, holyoake, s, vision, of, a, tolerant, democracy, that, treats, all, life, stance, groups, alike, rawl, s, idea, it, that, it, is, in, everybody, s, own, interest, to, endorse, a, reasonable, constitutional, democracy, with, principles, of, toleration, his, work, has, been, highly, influential, on, scholars, in, political, philosophy, and, his, term, overlapping, consensus, seems, to, have, for, many, parts, replaced, secularism, among, them, in, textbooks, on, modern, political, philosophy, like, colin, farrelly, s, an, introduction, to, contemporary, political, theory, and, will, kymlicka, s, contemporary, political, philosophy, the, term, secularism, is, not, even, indexed, and, in, the, former, it, can, be, seen, only, in, one, footnote, however, there, is, no, shortage, of, discussion, and, coverage, of, the, topic, it, involves, it, is, just, called, overlapping, consensus, pluralism, multiculturalism, or, expressed, in, some, other, way, in, the, oxford, handbook, of, political, theory, there, is, one, chapter, called, political, secularism, by, rajeev, bhargava, it, covers, secularism, in, a, global, context, and, starts, with, this, sentence, secularism, is, a, beleaguered, doctrine
