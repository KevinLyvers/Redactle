in, greek, and, roman, mythology, odysseus, d, s, i, s, diss, ee, s, greek, translit, odysse, s, odyse, s, ipa, also, known, by, the, latin, variant, ulysses, ju, l, s, i, z, yoo, liss, eez, uk, also, ju, l, s, i, z, yoo, liss, eez, latin, ulysses, ulixes, is, a, legendary, greek, king, of, ithaca, and, the, hero, of, homer, s, epic, poem, the, odyssey, odysseus, also, plays, a, key, role, in, homer, s, iliad, and, other, works, in, that, same, epic, cycle, as, the, son, of, la, rtes, and, anticlea, husband, of, penelope, and, father, of, telemachus, acusilaus, and, telegonus, odysseus, is, renowned, for, his, intellectual, brilliance, guile, and, versatility, polytropos, and, he, is, thus, known, by, the, epithet, odysseus, the, cunning, greek, translit, m, tis, lit, cunning, intelligence, he, is, most, famous, for, his, nostos, or, homecoming, which, took, him, ten, eventful, years, after, the, decade, long, trojan, war, the, form, odys, s, eus, is, used, starting, in, the, epic, period, and, through, the, classical, period, but, various, other, forms, are, also, found, in, vase, inscriptions, we, find, the, variants, oliseus, olyseus, olysseus, olyteus, olytteus, and, lysseus, the, form, oulix, s, is, attested, in, an, early, source, in, magna, graecia, ibycus, according, to, diomedes, grammaticus, while, the, greek, grammarian, aelius, herodianus, has, oulixeus, in, latin, he, was, known, as, ulix, s, or, considered, less, correct, ulyss, s, some, have, supposed, that, there, may, originally, have, been, two, separate, figures, one, called, something, like, odysseus, the, other, something, like, ulixes, who, were, combined, into, one, complex, personality, however, the, change, between, d, and, l, is, common, also, in, some, indo, european, and, greek, names, and, the, latin, form, is, supposed, to, be, derived, from, the, etruscan, uthuze, see, below, which, perhaps, accounts, for, some, of, the, phonetic, innovations, the, etymology, of, the, name, is, unknown, ancient, authors, linked, the, name, to, the, greek, verbs, odussomai, to, be, wroth, against, to, hate, to, oduromai, to, lament, bewail, or, even, to, ollumi, to, perish, to, be, lost, homer, relates, it, to, various, forms, of, this, verb, in, references, and, puns, in, book, 19, of, the, odyssey, where, odysseus, early, childhood, is, recounted, euryclea, asks, the, boy, s, grandfather, autolycus, to, name, him, euryclea, seems, to, suggest, a, name, like, polyaretos, for, he, has, much, been, prayed, for, but, autolycus, apparently, in, a, sardonic, mood, decided, to, give, the, child, another, name, commemorative, of, his, own, experience, in, life, since, i, have, been, angered, odyssamenos, with, many, both, men, and, women, let, the, name, of, the, child, be, odysseus, odysseus, often, receives, the, patronymic, epithet, laertiades, son, of, la, rtes, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, name, is, of, non, greek, origin, possibly, not, even, indo, european, with, an, unknown, etymology, robert, s, p, beekes, has, suggested, a, pre, greek, origin, in, etruscan, religion, the, name, and, stories, of, odysseus, were, adopted, under, the, name, uthuze, u, uze, which, has, been, interpreted, as, a, parallel, borrowing, from, a, preceding, minoan, form, of, the, name, possibly, oduze, pronounced, ot, ut, se, this, theory, is, supposed, to, explain, also, the, insecurity, of, the, phonologies, d, or, l, since, the, affricate, t, unknown, to, the, greek, of, that, time, gave, rise, to, different, counterparts, i, e, or, in, greek, in, etruscan, in, the, iliad, and, odyssey, homer, uses, several, epithets, to, describe, odysseus, starting, with, the, opening, where, he, is, described, as, the, man, of, many, devices, in, the, 1919, murray, translation, the, greek, word, used, is, polytropos, literally, the, man, of, many, turns, and, other, translators, have, suggested, alternate, english, translations, including, man, of, twists, and, turns, fagles, 1996, and, a, complicated, man, wilson, 2018, in, the, account, of, dares, the, phrygian, odysseus, was, illustrated, as, tough, crafty, cheerful, of, medium, height, eloquent, and, wise, relatively, little, is, given, of, odysseus, fictional, background, other, than, that, according, to, pseudo, apollodorus, his, paternal, grandfather, or, step, grandfather, is, arcesius, son, of, cephalus, and, grandson, of, aeolus, while, his, maternal, grandfather, is, the, thief, autolycus, son, of, hermes, and, chione, hence, odysseus, was, the, great, grandson, of, the, olympian, god, hermes, according, to, the, iliad, and, odyssey, his, father, is, laertes, and, his, mother, anticlea, although, there, was, a, non, homeric, tradition, that, sisyphus, was, his, true, father, the, rumour, went, that, la, rtes, bought, odysseus, from, the, conniving, king, odysseus, is, said, to, have, a, younger, sister, ctimene, who, went, to, same, to, be, married, and, is, mentioned, by, the, swineherd, eumaeus, whom, she, grew, up, alongside, in, book, 15, of, the, odyssey, odysseus, himself, under, the, guise, of, an, old, beggar, gives, the, swineherd, in, ithaca, a, fictitious, genealogy, from, broad, crete, i, declare, that, i, am, come, by, lineage, the, son, of, a, wealthy, man, and, many, other, sons, too, were, born, and, bred, in, his, halls, true, sons, of, a, lawful, wife, but, the, mother, that, bore, me, was, bought, a, concubine, yet, castor, son, of, hylax, of, whom, i, declare, that, i, am, sprung, honored, me, even, as, his, true, born, sons, the, majority, of, sources, for, odysseus, supposed, pre, war, exploits, principally, the, mythographers, pseudo, apollodorus, and, hyginus, postdate, homer, by, many, centuries, two, stories, in, particular, are, well, known, when, helen, of, troy, is, abducted, menelaus, calls, upon, the, other, suitors, to, honour, their, oaths, and, help, him, to, retrieve, her, an, attempt, that, leads, to, the, trojan, war, odysseus, tries, to, avoid, it, by, feigning, lunacy, as, an, oracle, had, prophesied, a, long, delayed, return, home, for, him, if, he, went, he, hooks, a, donkey, and, an, ox, to, his, plow, as, they, have, different, stride, lengths, hindering, the, efficiency, of, the, plow, and, some, modern, sources, add, starts, sowing, his, fields, with, salt, palamedes, at, the, behest, of, menelaus, brother, agamemnon, seeks, to, disprove, odysseus, madness, and, places, telemachus, odysseus, infant, son, in, front, of, the, plow, odysseus, veers, the, plow, away, from, his, son, thus, exposing, his, stratagem, odysseus, holds, a, grudge, against, palamedes, during, the, war, for, dragging, him, away, from, his, home, odysseus, and, other, envoys, of, agamemnon, travel, to, scyros, to, recruit, achilles, because, of, a, prophecy, that, troy, could, not, be, taken, without, him, by, most, accounts, thetis, achilles, mother, disguises, the, youth, as, a, woman, to, hide, him, from, the, recruiters, because, an, oracle, had, predicted, that, achilles, would, either, live, a, long, uneventful, life, or, achieve, everlasting, glory, while, dying, young, odysseus, cleverly, discovers, which, among, the, women, before, him, is, achilles, when, the, youth, is, the, only, one, of, them, to, show, interest, in, examining, the, weapons, hidden, among, an, array, of, adornment, gifts, for, the, daughters, of, their, host, odysseus, arranges, further, for, the, sounding, of, a, battle, horn, which, prompts, achilles, to, clutch, a, weapon, and, show, his, trained, disposition, with, his, disguise, foiled, he, is, exposed, and, joins, agamemnon, s, call, to, arms, among, the, hellenes, odysseus, is, represented, as, one, of, the, most, influential, greek, champions, during, the, trojan, war, in, homer, s, account, along, with, nestor, and, idomeneus, he, is, one, of, the, most, trusted, counsellors, and, advisors, he, always, champions, the, achaean, cause, especially, when, others, question, agamemnon, s, command, as, in, one, instance, when, thersites, speaks, against, him, when, agamemnon, to, test, the, morale, of, the, achaeans, announces, his, intentions, to, depart, troy, odysseus, restores, order, to, the, greek, camp, later, on, after, many, of, the, heroes, leave, the, battlefield, due, to, injuries, including, odysseus, and, agamemnon, odysseus, once, again, persuades, agamemnon, not, to, withdraw, along, with, two, other, envoys, he, is, chosen, in, the, failed, embassy, to, try, to, persuade, achilles, to, return, to, combat, when, hector, proposes, a, single, combat, duel, odysseus, is, one, of, the, danaans, who, reluctantly, volunteered, to, battle, him, telamonian, ajax, the, greater, however, is, the, volunteer, who, eventually, fights, hector, odysseus, aids, diomedes, during, the, night, operations, to, kill, rhesus, because, it, had, been, foretold, that, if, his, horses, drank, from, the, scamander, river, troy, could, not, be, taken, after, patroclus, is, slain, it, is, odysseus, who, counsels, achilles, to, let, the, achaean, men, eat, and, rest, rather, than, follow, his, rage, driven, desire, to, go, back, on, the, offensive, and, kill, trojans, immediately, eventually, and, reluctantly, he, consents, during, the, funeral, games, for, patroclus, odysseus, becomes, involved, in, a, wrestling, match, with, ajax, the, greater, and, foot, race, with, ajax, the, lesser, son, of, oileus, and, nestor, s, son, antilochus, he, draws, the, wrestling, match, and, with, the, help, of, the, goddess, athena, he, wins, the, race, odysseus, has, traditionally, been, viewed, as, achilles, antithesis, in, the, iliad, while, achilles, anger, is, all, consuming, and, of, a, self, destructive, nature, odysseus, is, frequently, viewed, as, a, man, of, the, mean, a, voice, of, reason, renowned, for, his, self, restraint, and, diplomatic, skills, he, is, also, in, some, respects, antithetical, to, telamonian, ajax, shakespeare, s, beef, witted, ajax, while, the, latter, has, only, brawn, to, recommend, him, odysseus, is, not, only, ingenious, as, evidenced, by, his, idea, for, the, trojan, horse, but, an, eloquent, speaker, a, skill, perhaps, best, demonstrated, in, the, embassy, to, achilles, in, book, 9, of, the, iliad, the, two, are, not, only, foils, in, the, abstract, but, often, opposed, in, practice, since, they, have, many, duels, and, run, ins, since, a, prophecy, suggested, that, the, trojan, war, would, not, be, won, without, achilles, odysseus, and, several, other, achaean, leaders, are, described, in, the, achilleid, as, having, gone, to, skyros, to, find, him, odysseus, discovered, achilles, by, offering, gifts, adornments, and, musical, instruments, as, well, as, weapons, to, the, king, s, daughters, and, then, having, his, companions, imitate, the, noises, of, an, enemy, s, attack, on, the, island, most, notably, making, a, blast, of, a, trumpet, heard, which, prompted, achilles, to, reveal, himself, by, picking, a, weapon, to, fight, back, and, together, they, departed, for, the, trojan, war, the, story, of, the, death, of, palamedes, has, many, versions, according, to, some, odysseus, never, forgives, palamedes, for, unmasking, his, feigned, madness, and, plays, a, part, in, his, downfall, one, tradition, says, odysseus, convinces, a, trojan, captive, to, write, a, letter, pretending, to, be, from, palamedes, a, sum, of, gold, is, mentioned, to, have, been, sent, as, a, reward, for, palamedes, treachery, odysseus, then, kills, the, prisoner, and, hides, the, gold, in, palamedes, tent, he, ensures, that, the, letter, is, found, and, acquired, by, agamemnon, and, also, gives, hints, directing, the, argives, to, the, gold, this, is, evidence, enough, for, the, greeks, and, they, have, palamedes, stoned, to, death, other, sources, say, that, odysseus, and, diomedes, goad, palamedes, into, descending, a, well, with, the, prospect, of, treasure, being, at, the, bottom, when, palamedes, reaches, the, bottom, the, two, proceed, to, bury, him, with, stones, killing, him, when, achilles, is, slain, in, battle, by, paris, it, is, odysseus, and, ajax, who, retrieve, the, fallen, warrior, s, body, and, armour, in, the, thick, of, heavy, fighting, during, the, funeral, games, for, achilles, odysseus, competes, once, again, with, ajax, thetis, says, that, the, arms, of, achilles, will, go, to, the, bravest, of, the, greeks, but, only, these, two, warriors, dare, lay, claim, to, that, title, the, two, argives, became, embroiled, in, a, heavy, dispute, about, one, another, s, merits, to, receive, the, reward, the, greeks, dither, out, of, fear, in, deciding, a, winner, because, they, did, not, want, to, insult, one, and, have, him, abandon, the, war, effort, nestor, suggests, that, they, allow, the, captive, trojans, to, decide, the, winner, the, accounts, of, the, odyssey, disagree, suggesting, that, the, greeks, themselves, hold, a, secret, vote, in, any, case, odysseus, is, the, winner, enraged, and, humiliated, ajax, is, driven, mad, by, athena, when, he, returns, to, his, senses, in, shame, at, how, he, has, slaughtered, livestock, in, his, madness, ajax, kills, himself, by, the, sword, that, hector, had, given, him, after, their, duel, together, with, diomedes, odysseus, fetches, achilles, son, pyrrhus, to, come, to, the, aid, of, the, achaeans, because, an, oracle, had, stated, that, troy, could, not, be, taken, without, him, a, great, warrior, pyrrhus, is, also, called, neoptolemus, greek, for, new, warrior, upon, the, success, of, the, mission, odysseus, gives, achilles, armour, to, him, it, is, learned, that, the, war, can, not, be, won, without, the, poisonous, arrows, of, heracles, which, are, owned, by, the, abandoned, philoctetes, odysseus, and, diomedes, or, according, to, some, accounts, odysseus, and, neoptolemus, leave, to, retrieve, them, upon, their, arrival, philoctetes, still, suffering, from, the, wound, is, seen, still, to, be, enraged, at, the, danaans, especially, at, odysseus, for, abandoning, him, although, his, first, instinct, is, to, shoot, odysseus, his, anger, is, eventually, diffused, by, odysseus, persuasive, powers, and, the, influence, of, the, gods, odysseus, returns, to, the, argive, camp, with, philoctetes, and, his, arrows, perhaps, odysseus, most, famous, contribution, to, the, greek, war, effort, is, devising, the, strategy, of, the, trojan, horse, which, allows, the, greek, army, to, sneak, into, troy, under, cover, of, darkness, it, is, built, by, epeius, and, filled, with, greek, warriors, led, by, odysseus, odysseus, and, diomedes, steal, the, palladium, that, lay, within, troy, s, walls, for, the, greeks, were, told, they, could, not, sack, the, city, without, it, some, late, roman, sources, indicate, that, odysseus, schemed, to, kill, his, partner, on, the, way, back, but, diomedes, thwarts, this, attempt, homer, s, iliad, and, odyssey, portray, odysseus, as, a, culture, hero, but, the, romans, who, believed, themselves, the, heirs, of, prince, aeneas, of, troy, considered, him, a, villainous, falsifier, in, virgil, s, aeneid, written, between, 29, and, 19, bc, he, is, constantly, referred, to, as, cruel, odysseus, latin, dirus, ulixes, or, deceitful, odysseus, pellacis, fandi, fictor, turnus, in, aeneid, book, 9, reproaches, the, trojan, ascanius, with, images, of, rugged, forthright, latin, virtues, declaring, in, john, dryden, s, translation, you, shall, not, find, the, sons, of, atreus, here, nor, need, the, frauds, of, sly, ulysses, fear, while, the, greeks, admired, his, cunning, and, deceit, these, qualities, did, not, recommend, themselves, to, the, romans, who, possessed, a, rigid, sense, of, honour, in, euripides, tragedy, iphigenia, at, aulis, having, convinced, agamemnon, to, consent, to, the, sacrifice, of, his, daughter, iphigenia, to, appease, the, goddess, artemis, odysseus, facilitates, the, immolation, by, telling, iphigenia, s, mother, clytemnestra, that, the, girl, is, to, be, wed, to, achilles, odysseus, attempts, to, avoid, his, sacred, oath, to, defend, menelaus, and, helen, offended, roman, notions, of, duty, and, the, many, stratagems, and, tricks, that, he, employed, to, get, his, way, offended, roman, notions, of, honour, odysseus, is, probably, best, known, as, the, eponymous, hero, of, the, odyssey, this, epic, describes, his, travails, which, lasted, for, 10, years, as, he, tries, to, return, home, after, the, trojan, war, and, reassert, his, place, as, rightful, king, of, ithaca, homebound, from, troy, after, a, raid, on, ismarus, in, the, land, of, the, cicones, he, and, his, twelve, ships, are, driven, off, course, by, storms, they, visit, the, lethargic, lotus, eaters, and, are, captured, by, the, cyclops, polyphemus, while, visiting, his, island, after, polyphemus, eats, several, of, his, men, he, and, odysseus, have, a, discussion, and, odysseus, tells, polyphemus, his, name, is, outis, nobody, odysseus, takes, a, barrel, of, wine, and, the, cyclops, drinks, it, falling, asleep, odysseus, and, his, men, take, a, wooden, stake, ignite, it, with, the, remaining, wine, and, blind, him, while, they, escape, polyphemus, cries, in, pain, and, the, other, cyclopes, ask, him, what, is, wrong, polyphemus, cries, nobody, has, blinded, me, and, the, other, cyclopes, think, he, has, gone, mad, odysseus, and, his, crew, escape, but, odysseus, rashly, reveals, his, real, name, and, polyphemus, prays, to, poseidon, his, father, to, take, revenge, they, stay, with, aeolus, the, master, of, the, winds, who, gives, odysseus, a, leather, bag, containing, all, the, winds, except, the, west, wind, a, gift, that, should, have, ensured, a, safe, return, home, however, the, sailors, foolishly, open, the, bag, while, odysseus, sleeps, thinking, that, it, contains, gold, all, of, the, winds, fly, out, and, the, resulting, storm, drives, the, ships, back, the, way, they, had, come, just, as, ithaca, comes, into, sight, after, pleading, in, vain, with, aeolus, to, help, them, again, they, re, embark, and, encounter, the, cannibalistic, laestrygonians, odysseus, ship, is, the, only, one, to, escape, he, sails, on, and, visits, the, witch, goddess, circe, she, turns, half, of, his, men, into, swine, after, feeding, them, cheese, and, wine, hermes, warns, odysseus, about, circe, and, gives, him, a, drug, called, moly, which, resists, circe, s, magic, circe, being, attracted, to, odysseus, resistance, falls, in, love, with, him, and, releases, his, men, odysseus, and, his, crew, remain, with, her, on, the, island, for, one, year, while, they, feast, and, drink, finally, odysseus, men, convince, him, to, leave, for, ithaca, guided, by, circe, s, instructions, odysseus, and, his, crew, cross, the, ocean, and, reach, a, harbor, at, the, western, edge, of, the, world, where, odysseus, sacrifices, to, the, dead, and, summons, the, spirit, of, the, old, prophet, tiresias, for, advice, next, odysseus, meets, the, spirit, of, his, own, mother, who, had, died, of, grief, during, his, long, absence, from, her, he, learns, for, the, first, time, news, of, his, own, household, threatened, by, the, greed, of, penelope, s, suitors, odysseus, also, talks, to, his, fallen, war, comrades, and, the, mortal, shade, of, heracles, odysseus, and, his, men, return, to, circe, s, island, and, she, advises, them, on, the, remaining, stages, of, the, journey, they, skirt, the, land, of, the, sirens, pass, between, the, six, headed, monster, scylla, and, the, whirlpool, charybdis, where, they, row, directly, between, the, two, however, scylla, drags, the, boat, towards, her, by, grabbing, the, oars, and, eats, six, men, they, land, on, the, island, of, thrinacia, there, odysseus, men, ignore, the, warnings, of, tiresias, and, circe, and, hunt, down, the, sacred, cattle, of, the, sun, god, helios, helios, tells, zeus, what, happened, and, demands, odysseus, men, be, punished, or, else, he, will, take, the, sun, and, shine, it, in, the, underworld, zeus, fulfills, helios, demands, by, causing, a, shipwreck, during, a, thunderstorm, in, which, all, but, odysseus, drown, he, washes, ashore, on, the, island, of, ogygia, where, calypso, compels, him, to, remain, as, her, lover, for, seven, years, he, finally, escapes, when, hermes, tells, calypso, to, release, odysseus, odysseus, is, shipwrecked, and, befriended, by, the, phaeacians, after, he, tells, them, his, story, the, phaeacians, led, by, king, alcinous, agree, to, help, odysseus, get, home, they, deliver, him, at, night, while, he, is, fast, asleep, to, a, hidden, harbor, on, ithaca, he, finds, his, way, to, the, hut, of, one, of, his, own, former, slaves, the, swineherd, eumaeus, and, also, meets, up, with, telemachus, returning, from, sparta, athena, disguises, odysseus, as, a, wandering, beggar, to, learn, how, things, stand, in, his, household, when, the, disguised, odysseus, returns, after, 20, years, he, is, recognized, only, by, his, faithful, dog, argos, penelope, announces, in, her, long, interview, with, the, disguised, hero, that, whoever, can, string, odysseus, rigid, bow, and, shoot, an, arrow, through, twelve, axe, shafts, may, have, her, hand, according, to, bernard, knox, for, the, plot, of, the, odyssey, of, course, her, decision, is, the, turning, point, the, move, that, makes, possible, the, long, predicted, triumph, of, the, returning, hero, odysseus, identity, is, discovered, by, the, housekeeper, eurycleia, as, she, is, washing, his, feet, and, discovers, an, old, scar, odysseus, received, during, a, boar, hunt, odysseus, swears, her, to, secrecy, threatening, to, kill, her, if, she, tells, anyone, when, the, contest, of, the, bow, begins, none, of, the, suitors, are, able, to, string, the, bow, after, all, the, suitors, have, given, up, the, disguised, odysseus, asks, to, participate, though, the, suitors, refuse, at, first, penelope, intervenes, and, allows, the, stranger, the, disguised, odysseus, to, participate, odysseus, easily, strings, his, bow, and, wins, the, contest, having, done, so, he, proceeds, to, slaughter, the, suitors, beginning, with, antinous, whom, he, finds, drinking, from, odysseus, cup, with, help, from, telemachus, and, two, of, odysseus, servants, eumaeus, the, swineherd, and, philoetius, the, cowherd, odysseus, tells, the, serving, women, who, slept, with, the, suitors, to, clean, up, the, mess, of, corpses, and, then, has, those, women, hanged, in, terror, he, tells, telemachus, that, he, will, replenish, his, stocks, by, raiding, nearby, islands, odysseus, has, now, revealed, himself, in, all, his, glory, with, a, little, makeover, by, athena, yet, penelope, cannot, believe, that, her, husband, has, really, returned, she, fears, that, it, is, perhaps, some, god, in, disguise, as, in, the, story, of, alcmene, mother, of, heracles, and, tests, him, by, ordering, her, servant, euryclea, to, move, the, bed, in, their, wedding, chamber, odysseus, protests, that, this, cannot, be, done, since, he, made, the, bed, himself, and, knows, that, one, of, its, legs, is, a, living, olive, tree, penelope, finally, accepts, that, he, truly, is, her, husband, a, moment, that, highlights, their, homophros, n, like, mindedness, the, next, day, odysseus, and, telemachus, visit, the, country, farm, of, his, old, father, la, rtes, the, citizens, of, ithaca, follow, odysseus, on, the, road, planning, to, avenge, the, killing, of, the, suitors, their, sons, the, goddess, athena, and, the, god, zeus, intervene,
