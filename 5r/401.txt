from, an, earlier, proto, norse, two, syllable, form, which, can, be, reconstructed, as, unarr, and, or, unurr, evidenced, by, the, poems, hymiskvi, a, and, rsdr, pa, and, modern, elfdalian, t, osdag, thursday, through, the, common, old, norse, development, of, the, sequence, unr, to, r, all, these, forms, of, thor, s, name, descend, from, proto, germanic, but, there, is, debate, as, to, precisely, what, form, the, name, took, at, that, early, stage, the, form, unraz, has, been, suggested, and, has, the, attraction, of, clearly, containing, the, sequence, unr, needed, to, explain, the, later, form, rr, 708, the, form, unuraz, is, suggested, by, elfdalian, t, osdag, thursday, and, by, a, runic, inscription, from, around, 700, from, hallbj, ns, in, sundre, gotland, which, includes, the, sequence, unur, urus, 709, 11, finally, unaraz, is, attractive, because, it, is, identical, to, the, name, of, the, ancient, celtic, god, taranus, by, metathesis, switch, of, sounds, of, an, earlier, tonaros, attested, in, the, dative, tanaro, and, the, gaulish, river, name, tanarus, and, further, related, to, the, latin, epithet, tonans, attached, to, jupiter, via, the, common, proto, indo, european, root, for, thunder, s, tenh, according, to, scholar, peter, jackson, those, theonyms, may, have, emerged, as, the, result, of, the, fossilization, of, an, original, epithet, or, epiclesis,

names, containing, the, theonym, rr, are, recorded, with, great, frequency, whereas, no, examples, are, known, prior, to, this, period, rr, based, names, may, have, flourished, during, the, viking, age, as, a, defiant, response, to, attempts, at, christianization, similar, to, the, widespread, viking, age, practice, of, wearing, thor, s, hammer, pendants, the, earliest, records, of, the, germanic, peoples, were, recorded, by, the, romans, and, in, these, works, thor, is, frequently, referred, to, via, a, process, known, as, interpretatio, romana, where, characteristics, perceived, to, be, similar, by, romans, result, in, identification, of, a, non, roman, god, as, a, roman, deity, as, either, the, roman, god, jupiter, also, known, as, jove, or, the, greco, roman, god, hercules, the, first, clear, example, of, this, occurs, in, the, roman, historian, tacitus, s, late, first, century, work, germania, where, writing, about, the, religion, of, the, suebi, a, confederation, of, germanic, peoples, he, comments, that, among, the, gods, mercury, is, the, one, they, principally, worship, they, regard, it, as, a, religious, duty, to, offer, to, him, on, fixed, days, human, as, well, as, other, sacrificial, victims, hercules, and, mars, they, appease, by, animal, offerings, of, the, permitted, kind, and, adds, that, a, portion, of, the, suebi, also, venerate, isis, in, this, instance, tacitus, refers, to, the, god, odin, as, mercury, thor, as, hercules, and, the, god, t, r, as, mars, and, the, identity, of, the, isis, of, the, suebi, has, been, debated, in, thor, s, case, the, identification, with, the, god, hercules, is, likely, at, least, in, part, due, to, similarities, between, thor, s, hammer, and, hercules, club, in, his, annals, tacitus, again, refers, to, the, veneration, of, hercules, by, the, germanic, peoples, he, records, a, wood, beyond, the, river, weser, in, what, is, now, northwestern, germany, as, dedicated, to, him, a, deity, known, as, hercules, magusanus, was, venerated, in, germania, inferior, due, to, the, roman, identification, of, thor, with, hercules, rudolf, simek, has, suggested, that, magusanus, was, originally, an, epithet, attached, to, the, proto, germanic, deity, unraz, the, first, recorded, instance, of, the, name, of, the, god, appears, upon, the, nordendorf, fibulae, a, piece, of, jewelry, created, during, the,

cosmological, lore, however, the, question, and, answer, session, turns, out, to, be, a, ploy, by, thor, as, although, thor, comments, that, he, has, truly, never, seen, anyone, with, more, wisdom, in, their, breast, thor, has, managed, to, delay, the, dwarf, enough, for, the, sun, to, turn, him, to, stone, day, dawns, on, you, now, dwarf, now, sun, shines, on, the, hall, in, the, poem,

tryggvasonar, and, l, fs, saga, helga, in, ynglinga, saga, chapter, 5, a, heavily, euhemerized, account, of, the, gods, is, provided, where, thor, is, described, as, having, been, a, gothi, a, pagan, priest, who, was, given, by, odin, who, himself, is, explained, away, as, having, been, an, exceedingly, powerful, magic, wielding, chieftain, from, the, east, a, dwelling, in, the, mythical, location, of, r, vangr, in, what, is, now, sweden, the, saga, narrative, adds, that, numerous, names, at, the, time, of, the, narrative, popularly, in, use, were, derived, from, thor, around, the, 12th, century, folk, traditions, and, iconography, of, the, christianizing, king, olaf, ii, of, norway, saint, olaf, c, 995, 1030, absorbed, elements, of, both, thor, and, freyr, after, olaf, s, death, his, cult, had, spread, quickly, all, over, scandinavia, where, many, churches, were, dedicated, to, him, as, well, as, to, other, parts, of, northern, europe, his, cult, distinctively, mixed, both, ecclesiastical, and, folk, elements, from, thor, he, inherited, the, quick, temper, physical, strength, and, merits, as, a, giant, slayer, early, depictions, portray, olaf, as, clean, shaven, but, after, 1200, he, appears, with, a, red, beard, for, centuries, olaf, figured, in, folk, traditions, as, a, slayer, of, trolls, and, giants, and, as, a, protector, against, malicious, forces, tales, about, thor, or, influenced, by, native, traditions, regarding, thor, continued, into, the, modern, period, particularly, in, scandinavia, writing, in, the, 19th, century, scholar, jacob, grimm, records, various, phrases, surviving, into, germanic, languages, that, refer, to, the, god, such, as, the, norwegian, thorsvarme, thor, s, warmth, for, lightning, and, the, swedish, godgubben, far, the, good, old, fellow, is, taking, a, ride, as, well, as, the, word, tord, n, thor, s, rumble, or, thor, s, thunder, when, it, thunders, grimm, comments, that, at, times, scandinavians, often, no, longer, liked, to, utter, the, god, s, real, name, or, they, wished, to, extol, his, fatherly, goodness, in, sweden, it, was, probably, as, a, euphemism, that, people, referred, to, thunder, as, the, ride, of, the, god, s, kia, own, ss, ekja, resulting, in, the, modern, swedish, word, for, thunder, ska, thor, remained, pictured, as, a, red, bearded, figure, as, evident, by, the, danish, rhyme, that, yet, referred, to, him, as, thor, med, sit, lange, sk, g, thor, with, his, long, beard, and, the, north, frisian, curse, diis, ruadhiiret, donner, regiir, let, red, haired, thunder, see, to, that, a, scandinavian, folk, belief, that, lightning, frightens, away, trolls, and, j, tnar, appears, in, numerous, scandinavian, folktales, and, may, be, a, late, reflection, of, thor, s, role, in, fighting, such, beings, in, connection, the, lack, of, trolls, and, ettins, in, modern, scandinavia, is, explained, as, a, result, of, the, accuracy, and, efficiency, of, the, lightning, strokes, in, the, netherlands, the, sagas, of, veluwe, has, a, story, called, ontstaan, van, het, uddeler, en, bleeke, meer, which, features, thor, and, his, fight, with, the, winter, giants, around, 1000, pendants, in, distinctive, shapes, representing, the, hammer, of, thor, have, been, unearthed, in, what, are, today, the, nordic, countries, england, northern, germany, the, baltic, countries, and, russia, most, have, very, simple, designs, in, iron, or, silver, around, 100, have, more, advanced, designs, with, ornaments, the, pendants, have, been, found, in, a, variety, of, contexts, including, at, urban, sites, and, in, hoards, and, occur, in, a, variety, of, shapes, similarly, coins, featuring, depictions, of, the, hammer, have, also, been, discovered, the, eyrarland, statue, a, copper, alloy, figure, found, near, akureyri, iceland, dating, from, around, the, 11th, century, may, depict, thor, seated, and, gripping, his, hammer, the, swastika, symbol, has, been, identified, as, representing, the, hammer, or, lightning, of, thor, scholar, hilda, ellis, davidson, 1965, comments, on, the, usage, of, the, swastika, as, a, symbol, of, thor, the, protective, sign, of, the, hammer, was, worn, by, women, as, we, know, from, the, fact, that, it, has, been, found, in, women, s, graves, it, seems, to, have, been, used, by, the, warrior, also, in, the, form, of, the, swastika, primarily, it, appears, to, have, had, connections, with, light, and, fire, and, to, have, been, linked, with, the, sun, wheel, it, may, have, been, on, account, of, thor, s, association, with, lightning, that, this, sign, was, used, as, an, alternative, to, the, hammer, for, it, is, found, on, memorial, stones, in, scandinavia, besides, inscriptions, to, thor, when, we, find, it, on, the, pommel, of, a, warrior, s, sword, and, on, his, sword, belt, the, assumption, is, that, the, warrior, was, placing, himself, under, the, thunder, god, s, protection, swastikas, appear, on, various, germanic, objects, stretching, from, the, migration, period, to, the, viking, age, such, as, the, 3rd, century, v, rl, se, fibula, dr, em85, 123, from, zealand, denmark, the, gothic, spearhead, from,

snoldelev, stone, dr, 248, from, rams, denmark, numerous, place, names, in, scandinavia, contain, the, old, norse, name, rr, the, identification, of, these, place, names, as, pointing, to, religious, significance, is, complicated, by, the, aforementioned, common, usage, of, rr, as, a, personal, name, element, cultic, significance, may, only, be, assured, in, place, names, containing, the, elements, v, signifying, the, location, of, a, v, a, type, of, pagan, germanic, shrine, h, f, a, structure, used, for, religious, purposes, see, heathen, hofs, and, lundr, a, holy, grove, the, place,

often, in, southern, norway, tors, thor, s, island, appears, on, the, swedish, west, coast, thor, also, appears, in, many, place, names, in, uppland, in, english, place, names, old, english, thunor,

old, english, thunor, s, pillar, f, m, stenton, noted, that, such, place, names, were, apparently, restricted, to, saxon, and, jutish, territory, and, not, found, in, anglian, areas, in, what, is, now, germany, locations, named, after, thor, are, sparsely, recorded, but, a, number, of, locations, called, donnersberg, german, donner, s, mountain, may, derive, their, name, from, the, deity, donner, the, southern, germanic, form, of, the, god, s, name, in, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, in, iceland, a, specific, breed, of, fox, was, known, as, holta, rr, thor, of, the, holt, likely, due, to, the, red, coat, of, the, breed, in, sweden, in, the, 19th, century, smooth, wedge, shaped, stones, found, in, the, earth, were, called, thorwiggar, thor, s, wedges, according, to, a, folk, belief, that, they, were, once, hurled, at, a, troll, by, the, god, thor, compare, thunderstones, similarly, meteorites, may, be, considered, memorials, to, thor, in, folk, tradition, due, to, their, sheer, weight, on, the, swedish, island, of, gotland, a, species, of, beetle, scarab, us, stercorarius, was, named, after, the, god, the, thorbagge, when, the, beetle, is, found, turned, upside, down, and, one, flips, it, over, thor, s, favor, may, be, gained, in, other, regions, of, sweden, the, name, of, the, beetle, appears, to, have, been, demonized, with, christianization, where, the, insect, came, to, be, known, as, thordedjefvul, or, thordyfvel, both, meaning, thor, devil, in, the, northwest, of, spain, there, is, a, river, called, tor, o, in, the, municipality, of, c, rmenes, le, n, that, take, name, from, the, god, thor, thor, closely, resembles, other, indo, european, deities, associated, with, the, thunder, the, celtic, taranis, the, estonian, taara, or, tharapita, the, baltic, perk, nas, the, slavic, perun, and, particularly, the, hindu, indra, whose, thunderbolt, weapon, the, vajra, is, an, obvious, parallels, noted, already, by, max, m, ller, scholars, have, compared, indra, s, slaying, of, vritra, with, thor, s, battle, with, j, rmungandr, although, in, the, past, it, was, suggested, that, thor, was, an, indigenous, sky, god, or, a, viking, age, import, into, scandinavia, these, indo, european, parallels, make, him, generally, accepted, today, as, ultimately, derived, from, a, proto, indo, european, deity, in, georges, dum, zil, s, trifunctional,

the, functions, of, indra, have, been, in, effect, taken, over, by, odin, many, scholars, have, noted, the, association, of, thor, with, fertility, particularly, in, later, folklore, and, in, the, reflex, of, him, represented, by, the, sami, hora, galles, good, man, thor, for, dum, zil, this, is, the, preservation, by, peasants, of, only, the, side, effect, of, the, god, s, atmospheric, battles, the, fertilizing, rain, others, have, emphasized, thor, s, close, connection, to, humanity, in, all, its, concerns, scholar, hilda, ellis, davidson, summarizes, the, cult, of, thor, was, linked, with, men, s, habitation, and, possessions, and, with, the, well, being, of, the, family, and, community, this, included, the, fruitfulness, of, the, fields, and, thor, although, pictured, primarily, as, a, storm, god, in, the, myths, was, also, concerned, with, the, fertility, and, preservation, of, the, seasonal, round, in, our, own, times, little, stone, axes, from, the, distant, past, have, been, used, as, fertility, symbols, and, placed, by, the, farmer, in, the, holes, made, by, the, drill, to, receive, the, first, seed, of, spring, thor, s, marriage, with, sif, of, the, golden, hair, about, which, we, hear, little, in, the, myths, seems, to, be, a, memory, of, the, ancient, symbol, of, divine, marriage, between, sky, god, and, earth, goddess, when, he, comes, to, earth, in, the, thunderstorm, and, the, storm, brings, the, rain, which, makes, the, fields, fertile, in, this, way, thor, as, well, as, odin, may, be, seen, to, continue, the, cult, of, the, sky, god, which, was, known, in, the, bronze, age, in, modern, times, thor, continues, to, be, referred, to, in, art, and, fiction, starting, with, f, j, klopstock, s, 1776, ode, to, thor, wir, und, sie,
