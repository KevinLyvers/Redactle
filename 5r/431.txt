the, holy, grail, french, saint, graal, breton, graal, santel, welsh, greal, sanctaidd, cornish, gral, is, a, treasure, that, serves, as, an, important, motif, in, arthurian, literature, various, traditions, describe, the, holy, grail, as, a, cup, dish, or, stone, with, miraculous, healing, powers, sometimes, providing, eternal, youth, or, sustenance, in, infinite, abundance, often, guarded, in, the, custody, of, the, fisher, king, and, located, in, the, hidden, grail, castle, by, analogy, any, elusive, object, or, goal, of, great, significance, may, be, perceived, as, a, holy, grail, by, those, seeking, such, a, mysterious, grail, old, french, graal, or, greal, wondrous, but, not, unequivocally, holy, first, appears, in, perceval, the, story, of, the, grail, an, unfinished, chivalric, romance, written, by, chr, tien, de, troyes, around, 1190, chr, tien, s, story, inspired, many, continuations, translators, and, interpreters, in, the, later, 12th, and, early, 13th, centuries, including, wolfram, von, eschenbach, who, portrayed, the, grail, as, a, stone, in, parzival, the, christian, celtic, or, possibly, other, origins, of, the, arthurian, grail, trope, are, uncertain, and, have, been, debated, among, literary, scholars, and, historians, in, the, 1190s, robert, de, boron, in, joseph, d, arimathie, portrayed, the, grail, as, jesus, s, vessel, from, the, last, supper, which, joseph, of, arimathea, used, to, catch, christ, s, blood, at, the, crucifixion, thereafter, the, holy, grail, became, interwoven, with, the, legend, of, the, holy, chalice, the, last, supper, cup, an, idea, continued, in, works, such, as, the, lancelot, grail, cycle, and, subsequently, the, 15th, century, le, morte, d, arthur, in, this, form, it, is, now, a, popular, theme, in, modern, culture, and, has, become, the, subject, of, folklore, studies, pseudohistorical, writings, works, of, fiction, and, conspiracy, theories, the, word, graal, as, it, is, spelled, in, its, earliest, appearances, comes, from, old, french, graal, or, greal, cognate, with, old, occitan, grazal, and, old, catalan, gresal, meaning, a, cup, or, bowl, of, earth, wood, or, metal, or, other, various, types, of, vessels, in, different, occitan, dialects, the, most, commonly, accepted, etymology, derives, it, from, latin, gradalis, or, gradale, via, an, earlier, form, cratalis, a, derivative, of, crater, or, cratus, which, was, in, turn, borrowed, from, ancient, greek, krater, a, large, wine, mixing, vessel, alternative, suggestions, include, a, derivative, of, cratis, a, name, for, a, type, of, woven, basket, that, came, to, refer, to, a, dish, or, a, derivative, of, latin, gradus, meaning, by, degree, by, stages, applied, to, a, dish, brought, to, the, table, in, different, stages, or, services, during, a, meal, in, the, 15th, century, english, writer, john, hardyng, invented, a, fanciful, new, etymology, for, old, french, san, graal, or, san, gr, al, meaning, holy, grail, by, parsing, it, as, sang, r, al, meaning, royal, blood, this, etymology, was, used, by, some, later, medieval, british, writers, such, as, thomas, malory, and, became, prominent, in, the, conspiracy, theory, developed, in, the, book, the, holy, blood, and, the, holy, grail, in, which, sang, real, refers, to, the, jesus, bloodline, the, literature, surrounding, the, grail, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, the, first, concerns, king, arthur, s, knights, visiting, the, grail, castle, or, questing, after, the, object, the, second, concerns, the, grail, s, earlier, history, in, the, time, of, joseph, of, arimathea, the, nine, works, from, the, first, group, are, of, the, second, group, there, are, the, grail, was, considered, a, bowl, or, dish, when, first, described, by, chr, tien, de, troyes, there, it, is, a, processional, salver, a, tray, used, to, serve, at, a, feast, h, linand, of, froidmont, described, a, grail, as, a, wide, and, deep, saucer, scutella, lata, et, aliquantulum, profunda, other, authors, had, their, own, ideas, robert, de, boron, portrayed, it, as, the, vessel, of, the, last, supper, peredur, son, of, efrawg, had, no, grail, as, such, presenting, the, hero, instead, with, a, platter, containing, his, kinsman, s, bloody, severed, head, the, grail, is, first, featured, in, perceval, le, conte, du, graal, the, story, of, the, grail, by, chr, tien, de, troyes, who, claims, he, was, working, from, a, source, book, given, to, him, by, his, patron, count, philip, of, flanders, in, this, incomplete, poem, dated, sometime, between, 1180, and, 1191, the, object, has, not, yet, acquired, the, implications, of, holiness, it, would, have, in, later, works, while, dining, in, the, magical, abode, of, the, fisher, king, perceval, witnesses, a, wondrous, procession, in, which, youths, carry, magnificent, objects, from, one, chamber, to, another, passing, before, him, at, each, course, of, the, meal, first, comes, a, young, man, carrying, a, bleeding, lance, then, two, boys, carrying, candelabras, finally, a, beautiful, young, girl, emerges, bearing, an, elaborately, decorated, graal, or, grail, chr, tien, refers, to, this, object, not, as, the, grail, but, as, a, grail, un, graal, showing, the, word, was, used, in, its, earliest, literary, context, as, a, common, noun, for, chr, tien, a, grail, was, a, wide, somewhat, deep, dish, or, bowl, interesting, because, it, contained, not, a, pike, salmon, or, lamprey, as, the, audience, may, have, expected, for, such, a, container, but, a, single, communion, wafer, which, provided, sustenance, for, the, fisher, king, s, crippled, father, perceval, who, had, been, warned, against, talking, too, much, remains, silent, through, all, of, this, and, wakes, up, the, next, morning, alone, he, later, learns, that, if, he, had, asked, the, appropriate, questions, about, what, he, saw, he, would, have, healed, his, maimed, host, much, to, his, honour, the, story, of, the, wounded, king, s, mystical, fasting, is, not, unique, several, saints, were, said, to, have, lived, without, food, besides, communion, for, instance, saint, catherine, of, genoa, this, may, imply, that, chr, tien, intended, the, communion, wafer, to, be, the, significant, part, of, the, ritual, and, the, grail, to, be, a, mere, prop, though, chr, tien, s, account, is, the, earliest, and, most, influential, of, all, grail, texts, it, was, in, the, work, of, robert, that, the, grail, truly, became, the, holy, grail, and, assumed, the, form, most, familiar, to, modern, readers, in, its, christian, context, in, his, verse, romance, joseph, d, arimathie, composed, between, 1191, and, 1202, robert, tells, the, story, of, joseph, of, arimathea, acquiring, the, chalice, of, the, last, supper, to, collect, christ, s, blood, upon, his, removal, from, the, cross, joseph, is, thrown, in, prison, where, christ, visits, him, and, explains, the, mysteries, of, the, blessed, cup, upon, his, release, joseph, gathers, his, in, laws, and, other, followers, and, travels, to, the, west, he, founds, a, dynasty, of, grail, keepers, that, eventually, includes, perceval, in, parzival, wolfram, von, eschenbach, citing, the, authority, of, a, certain, probably, fictional, kyot, the, proven, al, claimed, the, grail, was, a, stone, the, sanctuary, of, the, neutral, angels, who, took, neither, side, during, lucifer, s, rebellion, it, is, called, lapis, exillis, which, in, alchemy, is, the, name, of, the, philosopher, s, stone, the, authors, of, the, lancelot, grail, cycle, used, the, grail, as, a, symbol, of, divine, grace, the, virgin, galahad, illegitimate, son, of, lancelot, and, elaine, the, world, s, greatest, knight, and, the, grail, bearer, at, the, castle, of, corbenic, is, destined, to, achieve, the, grail, his, spiritual, purity, making, him, a, greater, warrior, than, even, his, illustrious, father, the, queste, del, saint, graal, the, quest, of, the, holy, grail, tells, also, of, the, adventures, of, various, knights, of, the, round, table, in, their, eponymous, quest, some, of, them, including, percival, and, bors, the, younger, eventually, join, galahad, as, his, companions, near, the, successful, end, of, the, grail, quest, and, are, witnesses, of, his, ascension, to, heaven, galahad, and, the, interpretation, of, the, grail, involving, him, were, picked, up, in, the, 15th, century, by, thomas, malory, in, le, morte, d, arthur, and, remain, popular, today, while, it, is, not, explicit, that, the, holy, grail, is, never, to, be, seen, again, on, earth, it, is, stated, by, malory, that, there, has, since, then, been, no, knight, capable, of, obtaining, it, scholars, have, long, speculated, on, the, origins, of, the, holy, grail, before, chr, tien, suggesting, that, it, may, contain, elements, of, the, trope, of, magical, cauldrons, from, celtic, mythology, and, later, welsh, mythology, combined, with, christian, legend, surrounding, the, eucharist, the, latter, found, in, eastern, christian, sources, conceivably, in, that, of, the, byzantine, mass, or, even, persian, sources, the, view, that, the, origin, of, the, grail, legend, should, be, seen, as, deriving, from, celtic, mythology, was, championed, by, roger, sherman, loomis, alfred, nutt, and, jessie, weston, loomis, traced, a, number, of, parallels, between, medieval, welsh, literature, and, irish, material, and, the, grail, romances, including, similarities, between, the, mabinogion, s, bran, the, blessed, and, the, arthurian, fisher, king, and, between, bran, s, life, restoring, cauldron, and, the, grail, the, opposing, view, dismissed, the, celtic, connections, as, spurious, and, interpreted, the, legend, as, essentially, christian, in, origin, joseph, goering, identified, sources, for, grail, imagery, in, 12th, century, wall, paintings, from, churches, in, the, catalan, pyrenees, now, mostly, moved, to, the, museu, nacional, d, art, de, catalunya, which, present, unique, iconic, images, of, the, virgin, mary, holding, a, bowl, that, radiates, tongues, of, fire, images, that, predate, the, first, literary, account, by, chr, tien, de, troyes, goering, argues, that, they, were, the, original, inspiration, for, the, grail, legend, psychologists, emma, jung, and, marie, louise, von, franz, used, analytical, psychology, to, interpret, the, grail, as, a, series, of, symbols, in, their, book, the, grail, legend, they, directly, expanded, on, interpretations, by, carl, jung, which, were, later, invoked, by, joseph, campbell, philosopher, henry, corbin, a, member, of, the, eranos, circle, founded, by, jung, also, commented, on, the, esoteric, significance, of, the, grail, relating, it, to, the, iranian, islamic, symbols, that, he, studied, richard, barber, 2004, argued, that, the, grail, legend, is, connected, to, the, introduction, of, more, ceremony, and, mysticism, surrounding, the, sacrament, of, the, eucharist, in, the, high, medieval, period, proposing, that, the, first, grail, stories, may, have, been, connected, to, the, renewal, in, this, traditional, sacrament, daniel, scavone, 1999, 2003, has, argued, that, the, grail, originally, referred, to, the, image, of, edessa, goulven, peron, 2016, suggested, that, the, holy, grail, may, reflect, the, horn, of, the, river, god, achelous, as, described, by, ovid, in, the, metamorphoses, in, the, wake, of, the, arthurian, romances, several, artifacts, came, to, be, identified, as, the, holy, grail, in, medieval, relic, veneration, these, artifacts, are, said, to, have, been, the, vessel, used, at, the, last, supper, but, other, details, vary, despite, the, prominence, of, the, grail, literature, traditions, about, a, last, supper, relic, remained, rare, in, contrast, to, other, items, associated, with, jesus, last, days, such, as, the, true, cross, and, holy, lance, one, tradition, predates, the, grail, romances, in, the, 7th, century, the, pilgrim, arculf, reported, that, the, last, supper, chalice, was, displayed, near, jerusalem, in, the, wake, of, robert, de, boron, s, grail, works, several, other, items, came, to, be, claimed, as, the, true, last, supper, vessel, in, the, late, 12th, century, one, was, said, to, be, in, byzantium, albrecht, von, scharfenberg, s, grail, romance, der, j, ngere, titurel, associated, it, explicitly, with, the, arthurian, grail, but, claimed, it, was, only, a, copy, this, item, was, said, to, have, been, looted, in, the, fourth, crusade, and, brought, to, troyes, in, france, but, it, was, lost, during, the, french, revolution, two, relics, associated, with, the, grail, survive, today, the, sacro, catino, sacred, basin, also, known, as, the, genoa, chalice, is, a, green, glass, dish, held, at, the, genoa, cathedral, said, to, have, been, used, at, the, last, supper, its, provenance, is, unknown, and, there, are, two, divergent, accounts, of, how, it, was, brought, to, genoa, by, crusaders, in, the, 12th, century, it, was, not, associated, with, the, last, supper, until, later, in, the, wake, of, the, grail, romances, the, first, known, association, is, in, jacobus, de, voragine, s, chronicle, of, genoa, in, the, late, 13th, century, which, draws, on, the, grail, literary, tradition, the, catino, was, moved, and, broken, during, napoleon, s, conquest, in, the, early, 19th, century, revealing, that, it, is, glass, rather, than, emerald, the, holy, chalice, of, valencia, is, an, agate, dish, with, a, mounting, for, use, as, a, chalice, the, bowl, may, date, to, greco, roman, times, but, its, dating, is, unclear, and, its, provenance, is, unknown, before, 1399, when, it, was, gifted, to, martin, i, of, aragon, by, the, 14th, century, an, elaborate, tradition, had, developed, that, this, object, was, the, last, supper, chalice, this, tradition, mirrors, aspects, of, the, grail, material, with, several, major, differences, suggesting, a, separate, tradition, entirely, it, is, not, associated, with, joseph, of, arimathea, or, jesus, blood, it, is, said, to, have, been, taken, to, rome, by, saint, peter, and, later, entrusted, to, saint, lawrence, early, references, do, not, call, the, object, the, grail, the, first, evidence, connecting, it, to, the, grail, tradition, is, from, the, 15th, century, the, monarchy, sold, the, cup, in, the, 15th, century, to, valencia, cathedral, where, it, remains, a, significant, local, icon, several, objects, were, identified, with, the, holy, grail, in, the, 17th, century, in, the, 20th, century, a, series, of, new, items, became, associated, with, it, these, include, the, nanteos, cup, a, medieval, wooden, bowl, found, near, rhydyfelin, wales, a, glass, dish, found, near, glastonbury, england, the, antioch, chalice, a, 6th, century, silver, gilt, object, that, became, attached, to, the, grail, legend, in, the, 1930s, and, the, chalice, of, do, a, urraca, a, cup, made, between, 200, bc, and, 100, ad, kept, in, le, n, s, basilica, of, saint, isidore, in, the, modern, era, a, number, of, places, have, become, associated, with, the, holy, grail, one, of, the, most, prominent, is, glastonbury, in, somerset, england, glastonbury, was, associated, with, king, arthur, and, his, resting, place, of, avalon, by, the, 12th, century, in, the, 13th, century, a, legend, arose, that, joseph, of, arimathea, was, the, founder, of, glastonbury, abbey, early, accounts, of, joseph, at, glastonbury, focus, on, his, role, as, the, evangelist, of, britain, rather, than, as, the, custodian, of, the, holy, grail, but, from, the, 15th, century, the, grail, became, a, more, prominent, part, of, the, legends, surrounding, glastonbury, interest, in, glastonbury, resurged, in, the, late, 19th, century, inspired, by, renewed, interest, in, the, arthurian, legend, and, contemporary, spiritual, movements, centered, on, ancient, sacred, sites, in, the, late, 19th, century, john, goodchild, hid, a, glass, bowl, near, glastonbury, a, group, of, his, friends, including, wellesley, tudor, pole, retrieved, the, cup, in, 1906, and, promoted, it, as, the, original, holy, grail, glastonbury, and, its, holy, grail, legend, have, since, become, a, point, of, focus, for, various, new, age, and, neopagan, groups, in, the, early, 20th, century, esoteric, writers, identified, monts, gur, a, stronghold, of, the, heretical, cathar, sect, in, the, 13th, century, as, the, grail, castle, similarly, the, 14th, century, rosslyn, chapel, in, midlothian, scotland, became, attached, to, the, grail, legend, in, the, mid, 20th, century, when, a, succession, of, conspiracy, books, identified, it, as, a, secret, hiding, place, of, the, grail, since, the, 19th, century, the, holy, grail, has, been, linked, to, various, conspiracy, theories, in, 1818, austrian, pseudohistorical, writer, joseph, von, hammer, purgstall, connected, the, grail, to, contemporary, myths, surrounding, the, knights, templar, that, cast, the, order, as, a, secret, society, dedicated, to, mystical, knowledge, and, relics, in, hammer, purgstall, s, work, the, grail, is, not, a, physical, relic, but, a, symbol, of, the, secret, knowledge, that, the, templars, sought, there, is, no, historical, evidence, linking, the, templars, to, a, search, for, the, grail, but, subsequent, writers, have, elaborated, on, the, templar, theories, starting, in, the, early, 20th, century, writers, particularly, in, france, further, connected, the, templars, and, grail, to, the, cathars, in, 1906, french, esoteric, writer, jos, phin, p, ladan, identified, the, cathar, castle, of, monts, gur, with, munsalv, sche, or, montsalvat, the, grail, castle, in, wolfram, s, parzival, this, identification, has, inspired, a, wider, legend, asserting, that, the, cathars, possessed, the, holy, grail, according, to, these, stories, the, cathars, guarded, the, grail, at, monts, gur, and, smuggled, it, out, when, the, castle, fell, in, 1244, beginning, in, 1933, german, writer, otto, rahn, published, a, series, of, books, tying, the, grail, templars, and, cathars, to, modern, german, nationalist, mythology, according, to, rahn, the, grail, was, a, symbol, of, a, pure, germanic, religion, repressed, by, christianity, rahn, s, books, inspired, interest, in, the, grail, within, nazi, occultist, circles, and, led, to, the, ss, chief, heinrich, himmler, s, abortive, sponsorship, of, rahn, s, search, for, the, grail, as, well, as, many, subsequent, conspiracy, theories, and, fictional, works, about, the, nazis, searching, for, the, grail, in, the, late, 20th, century, writers, michael, baigent, richard, leigh, and, henry, lincoln, created, one, of, the, most, widely, known, conspiracy, theories, about, the, holy, grail, the, theory, first, appeared, on, the, bbc, documentary, series, chronicle, in, the, 1970s, and, was, elaborated, upon, in, the, bestselling, 1982, book, holy, blood, holy, grail, the, theory, combines, myths, about, the, templars, and, cathars, with, various, other, legends, and, a, prominent, hoax, about, a, secret, order, called, the, priory, of, sion, according, to, this, theory, the, holy, grail, is, not, a, physical, object, but, a, symbol, of, the, bloodline, of, jesus, the, blood, connection, is, based, on, the, etymological, reading, of, san, greal, holy, grail, as, sang, real, royal, blood, which, dates, to, the, 15th, century, the, narrative, developed, is, that, jesus, was, not, divine, and, had, children, with, mary, magdalene, who, took, the, family, to, france, where, their, descendants, became, the, merovingian, dynasty, supposedly, while, the, catholic, church, worked, to, destroy, the, dynasty, they, were, protected, by, the, priory, of, sion, and, their, associates, including, the, templars, cathars, and, other, secret, societies, the, book, its, arguments, and, its, evidence, have, been, widely, dismissed, by, scholars, as, pseudohistorical, but, it, has, had, a, vast, influence, on, conspiracy, and, alternate, history, books, it, has, also, inspired, fiction, most, notably, dan, brown, s, 2003, novel, the, da, vinci, code, and, its, 2006, film, adaptation, the, combination, of, hushed, reverence, chromatic, harmonies, and, sexualized, imagery, in, richard, wagner, s, final, music, drama, parsifal, premiered, in, 1882, developed, this, theme, associating, the, grail, now, periodically, producing, blood, directly, with, female, fertility, the, high, seriousness, of, the, subject, was, also, epitomized, in, dante, gabriel, rossetti, s, painting, in, which, a, woman, modeled, by, alexa, wilding, holds, the, grail, with, one, hand, while, adopting, a, gesture, of, blessing, with, the, other, a, major, mural, series, depicting, the, quest, for, the, holy, grail, was, done, by, the, artist, edwin, austin, abbey, during, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, for, the, boston, public, library, other, artists, including, george, frederic, watts, and, william, dyce, also, portrayed, grail, subjects, the, story, of, the, grail, and, of, the, quest, to, find, it, became, increasingly, popular, in, the, 19th, century, referred, to, in, literature, such, as, alfred, lord, tennyson, s, arthurian, cycle, idylls, of, the, king, a, sexualised, interpretation, of, the, grail, now, identified, with, female, genitalia, appeared, in, 1870, in, hargrave, jennings, book, the, rosicrucians, their, rites, and, mysteries, in, the, cinema, the, holy, grail, debuted, in, the, 1904, silent, film,
