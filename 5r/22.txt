islamic, philosophy, is, philosophy, that, emerges, from, the, islamic, tradition, two, terms, traditionally, used, in, the, islamic, world, are, sometimes, translated, as, philosophy, falsafa, lit, philosophy, which, refers, to, philosophy, as, well, as, logic, mathematics, and, physics, and, kalam, lit, speech, which, refers, to, a, rationalist, form, of, scholastic, islamic, theology, which, includes, the, schools, of, maturidiyah, ashaira, and, mu, tazila, early, islamic, philosophy, began, with, al, kindi, in, the, 2nd, century, of, the, islamic, calendar, early, 9th, century, ce, and, ended, with, ibn, rushd, averroes, in, the, 6th, century, ah, late, 12th, century, ce, broadly, coinciding, with, the, period, known, as, the, golden, age, of, islam, the, death, of, averroes, effectively, marked, the, end, of, a, particular, discipline, of, islamic, philosophy, usually, called, the, peripatetic, islamic, school, and, philosophical, activity, declined, significantly, in, western, islamic, countries, such, as, islamic, iberia, and, north, africa, islamic, philosophy, persisted, for, much, longer, in, muslim, eastern, countries, in, particular, safavid, persia, ottoman, and, mughal, empires, where, several, schools, of, philosophy, continued, to, flourish, avicennism, averroism, illuminationist, philosophy, mystical, philosophy, transcendent, theosophy, and, isfahan, philosophy, ibn, khaldun, in, his, muqaddimah, made, important, contributions, to, the, philosophy, of, history, interest, in, islamic, philosophy, revived, during, the, nahda, awakening, movement, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, and, continues, to, the, present, day, islamic, philosophy, had, a, major, impact, in, christian, europe, where, translation, of, arabic, philosophical, texts, into, latin, led, to, the, transformation, of, almost, all, philosophical, disciplines, in, the, medieval, latin, world, with, a, particularly, strong, influence, of, muslim, philosophers, being, felt, in, natural, philosophy, psychology, and, metaphysics, islamic, philosophy, refers, to, philosophy, produced, in, an, islamic, society, as, it, is, not, necessarily, concerned, with, religious, issues, nor, exclusively, produced, by, muslims, many, scholars, prefer, the, term, arabic, philosophy, islamic, philosophy, is, a, generic, term, that, can, be, defined, and, used, in, different, ways, in, its, broadest, sense, it, means, the, world, view, of, islam, as, derived, from, the, islamic, texts, concerning, the, creation, of, the, universe, and, the, will, of, the, creator, in, another, sense, it, refers, to, any, of, the, schools, of, thought, that, flourished, under, the, islamic, empire, or, in, the, shadow, of, the, arab, islamic, culture, and, islamic, civilization, in, its, narrowest, sense, it, is, a, translation, of, falsafa, meaning, those, particular, schools, of, thought, that, most, reflect, the, influence, of, greek, systems, of, philosophy, such, as, neoplatonism, and, aristotelianism, some, schools, of, thought, within, islam, deny, the, usefulness, or, legitimacy, of, philosophical, inquiry, some, argue, that, there, is, no, indication, that, the, limited, knowledge, and, experience, of, humans, can, lead, to, truth, it, is, also, important, to, observe, that, while, reason, aql, is, sometimes, recognised, as, a, source, of, islamic, law, it, has, been, claimed, that, this, has, a, totally, different, meaning, from, reason, in, philosophy, the, historiography, of, islamic, philosophy, is, marked, by, disputes, as, to, how, the, subject, should, be, properly, interpreted, some, of, the, key, issues, involve, the, comparative, importance, of, eastern, intellectuals, such, as, ibn, sina, avicenna, and, of, western, thinkers, such, as, ibn, rushd, and, also, whether, islamic, philosophy, can, be, read, at, face, value, or, should, be, interpreted, in, an, esoteric, fashion, supporters, of, the, latter, thesis, like, leo, strauss, maintain, that, islamic, philosophers, wrote, so, as, to, conceal, their, true, meaning, in, order, to, avoid, religious, persecution, but, scholars, such, as, oliver, leaman, disagree, the, main, sources, of, classical, or, early, islamic, philosophy, are, the, religion, of, islam, itself, especially, ideas, derived, and, interpreted, from, the, quran, and, greek, philosophy, which, the, early, muslims, inherited, as, a, result, of, conquests, along, with, pre, islamic, indian, philosophy, and, persian, philosophy, many, of, the, early, philosophical, debates, centered, around, reconciling, religion, and, reason, the, latter, exemplified, by, greek, philosophy, in, early, islamic, thought, which, refers, to, philosophy, during, the, islamic, golden, age, traditionally, dated, between, the, 8th, and, 12th, centuries, two, main, currents, may, be, distinguished, the, first, is, kalam, which, mainly, dealt, with, islamic, theological, questions, and, the, other, is, falsafa, which, was, founded, on, interpretations, of, aristotelianism, and, neoplatonism, there, were, attempts, by, later, philosopher, theologians, at, harmonizing, both, trends, notably, by, ibn, sina, avicenna, who, founded, the, school, of, avicennism, ibn, rushd, averroes, who, founded, the, school, of, averroism, and, others, such, as, ibn, al, haytham, alhazen, and, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, ilm, al, kal, m, arabic, is, the, philosophy, that, seeks, islamic, theological, principles, through, dialectic, in, arabic, the, word, literally, means, speech, one, of, the, first, debates, was, that, between, partisans, of, the, qadar, meaning, fate, who, affirmed, free, will, and, the, jabarites, meaning, force, constraint, who, believed, in, fatalism, at, the, 2nd, century, of, the, hijra, a, new, movement, arose, in, the, theological, school, of, basra, iraq, a, pupil, of, hasan, of, basra, wasil, ibn, ata, left, the, group, when, he, disagreed, with, his, teacher, on, whether, a, muslim, who, has, committed, a, major, sin, invalidates, his, faith, he, systematized, the, radical, opinions, of, preceding, sects, particularly, those, of, the, qadarites, and, jabarites, this, new, school, was, called, mu, tazilite, from, i, tazala, to, separate, oneself, the, mu, tazilites, looked, in, towards, a, strict, rationalism, with, which, to, interpret, islamic, doctrine, their, attempt, was, one, of, the, first, to, pursue, a, rational, theology, in, islam, they, were, however, severely, criticized, by, other, islamic, philosophers, both, maturidis, and, asharites, the, great, asharite, scholar, fakhr, ad, din, ar, razi, wrote, the, work, al, mutakallimin, fi, ilm, al, kalam, against, the, mutazalites, in, later, times, kalam, was, used, to, mean, simply, theology, i, e, the, duties, of, the, heart, as, opposed, to, or, in, conjunction, with, fiqh, jurisprudence, the, duties, of, the, body, falsafa, is, a, greek, loanword, meaning, philosophy, the, greek, pronunciation, philosophia, became, falsafa, from, the, 9th, century, onward, due, to, caliph, al, ma, mun, and, his, successor, ancient, greek, philosophy, was, introduced, among, the, arabs, and, the, peripatetic, school, began, to, find, able, representatives, among, them, were, al, kindi, al, farabi, avicenna, and, averroes, another, trend, represented, by, the, brethren, of, purity, used, aristotelian, language, to, expound, a, fundamentally, neoplatonic, and, neopythagorean, world, view, during, the, abbasid, caliphate, a, number, of, thinkers, and, scientists, some, of, them, heterodox, muslims, or, non, muslims, played, a, role, in, transmitting, greek, hindu, and, other, pre, islamic, knowledge, to, the, christian, west, three, speculative, thinkers, al, farabi, avicenna, and, al, kindi, combined, aristotelianism, and, neoplatonism, with, other, ideas, introduced, through, islam, ahmad, sirhindi, 17th, century, indian, islamic, scholar, has, viewed, that, the, greek, philosophy, about, creations, are, incompatible, with, islamic, teaching, by, quoting, several, chapters, of, quran, furthermore, sirhindi, criticize, the, method, of, interpretating, the, meaning, of, quran, with, philosophy, by, the, 12th, century, kalam, attacked, by, both, the, philosophers, and, the, orthodox, perished, for, lack, of, champions, at, the, same, time, however, falsafa, came, under, serious, critical, scrutiny, the, most, devastating, attack, came, from, al, ghazali, whose, work, tahafut, al, falasifa, the, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, attacked, the, main, arguments, of, the, peripatetic, school, averroes, maimonides, contemporary, was, one, of, the, last, of, the, islamic, peripatetics, and, set, out, to, defend, the, views, of, the, falsafa, against, al, ghazali, s, criticism, the, theories, of, ibn, rushd, do, not, differ, fundamentally, from, those, of, ibn, bajjah, and, ibn, tufail, who, only, follow, the, teachings, of, avicenna, and, al, farabi, like, all, islamic, peripatetics, averroes, admits, the, hypothesis, of, the, intelligence, of, the, spheres, and, the, hypothesis, of, universal, emanation, through, which, motion, is, communicated, from, place, to, place, to, all, parts, of, the, universe, as, far, as, the, supreme, world, hypotheses, which, in, the, mind, of, the, arabic, philosophers, did, away, with, the, dualism, involved, in, aristotle, s, doctrine, of, pure, energy, and, eternal, matter, but, while, al, farabi, avicenna, and, other, persian, and, muslim, philosophers, hurried, so, to, speak, over, subjects, that, trenched, on, traditional, beliefs, ibn, rushd, delighted, in, dwelling, upon, them, with, full, particularity, and, stress, thus, he, says, not, only, is, matter, eternal, but, form, is, potentially, inherent, in, matter, otherwise, it, were, a, creation, ex, nihilo, munk, m, langes, p, 444, according, to, this, theory, therefore, the, existence, of, this, world, is, not, only, a, possibility, as, avicenna, declared, but, also, a, necessity, in, early, islamic, philosophy, logic, played, an, important, role, sharia, islamic, law, placed, importance, on, formulating, standards, of, argument, which, gave, rise, to, a, novel, approach, to, logic, in, kalam, but, this, approach, was, later, displaced, by, ideas, from, greek, philosophy, and, hellenistic, philosophy, with, the, rise, of, the, mu, tazili, philosophers, who, highly, valued, aristotle, s, organon, the, works, of, hellenistic, influenced, islamic, philosophers, were, crucial, in, the, reception, of, aristotelian, logic, in, medieval, europe, along, with, the, commentaries, on, the, organon, by, averroes, the, works, of, al, farabi, avicenna, al, ghazali, and, other, muslim, logicians, who, often, criticized, and, corrected, aristotelian, logic, and, introduced, their, own, forms, of, logic, also, played, a, central, role, in, the, subsequent, development, of, european, logic, during, the, renaissance, according, to, the, routledge, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, for, the, islamic, philosophers, logic, included, not, only, the, study, of, formal, patterns, of, inference, and, their, validity, but, also, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, language, and, even, of, epistemology, and, metaphysics, because, of, territorial, disputes, with, the, arabic, grammarians, islamic, philosophers, were, very, interested, in, working, out, the, relationship, between, logic, and, language, and, they, devoted, much, discussion, to, the, question, of, the, subject, matter, and, aims, of, logic, in, relation, to, reasoning, and, speech, in, the, area, of, formal, logical, analysis, they, elaborated, upon, the, theory, of, terms, propositions, and, syllogisms, as, formulated, in, aristotle, s, categories, de, interpretatione, and, prior, analytics, in, the, spirit, of, aristotle, they, considered, the, syllogism, to, be, the, form, to, which, all, rational, argumentation, could, be, reduced, and, they, regarded, syllogistic, theory, as, the, focal, point, of, logic, even, poetics, was, considered, as, a, syllogistic, art, in, some, fashion, by, most, of, the, major, islamic, aristotelians, important, developments, made, by, muslim, logicians, included, the, development, of, avicennian, logic, as, a, replacement, of, aristotelian, logic, avicenna, s, system, of, logic, was, responsible, for, the, introduction, of, hypothetical, syllogism, temporal, modal, logic, and, inductive, logic, other, important, developments, in, early, islamic, philosophy, include, the, development, of, a, strict, science, of, citation, the, isnad, or, backing, and, the, development, of, a, method, to, disprove, claims, the, ijtihad, which, was, generally, applied, to, many, types, of, questions, early, forms, of, analogical, reasoning, inductive, reasoning, and, categorical, syllogism, were, introduced, in, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, sharia, and, kalam, islamic, theology, from, the, 7th, century, with, the, process, of, qiyas, before, the, arabic, translations, of, aristotle, s, works, later, during, the, islamic, golden, age, there, was, debate, among, islamic, philosophers, logicians, and, theologians, over, whether, the, term, qiyas, refers, to, analogical, reasoning, inductive, reasoning, or, categorical, syllogism, some, islamic, scholars, argued, that, qiyas, refers, to, inductive, reasoning, ibn, hazm, 994, 1064, disagreed, arguing, that, qiyas, does, not, refer, to, inductive, reasoning, but, to, categorical, syllogistic, reasoning, in, a, real, sense, and, analogical, reasoning, in, a, metaphorical, sense, on, the, other, hand, al, ghazali, 1058, 1111, and, in, modern, times, abu, muhammad, asem, al, maqdisi, argued, that, qiyas, refers, to, analogical, reasoning, in, a, real, sense, and, categorical, syllogism, in, a, metaphorical, sense, other, islamic, scholars, at, the, time, however, argued, that, the, term, qiyas, refers, to, both, analogical, reasoning, and, categorical, syllogism, in, a, real, sense, the, first, original, arabic, writings, on, logic, were, produced, by, al, kindi, alkindus, 805, 873, who, produced, a, summary, on, earlier, logic, up, to, his, time, the, first, writings, on, logic, with, non, aristotelian, elements, was, produced, by, al, farabi, alfarabi, 873, 950, who, discussed, the, topics, of, future, contingents, the, number, and, relation, of, the, categories, the, relation, between, logic, and, grammar, and, non, aristotelian, forms, of, inference, he, is, also, credited, for, categorizing, logic, into, two, separate, groups, the, first, being, idea, and, the, second, being, proof, averroes, 1126, 1198, author, of, the, most, elaborate, commentaries, on, aristotelian, logic, was, the, last, major, logician, from, al, andalus, avicenna, 980, 1037, developed, his, own, system, of, logic, known, as, avicennian, logic, as, an, alternative, to, aristotelian, logic, by, the, 12th, century, avicennian, logic, had, replaced, aristotelian, logic, as, the, dominant, system, of, logic, in, the, islamic, world, the, first, criticisms, of, aristotelian, logic, were, written, by, avicenna, 980, 1037, who, produced, independent, treatises, on, logic, rather, than, commentaries, he, criticized, the, logical, school, of, baghdad, for, their, devotion, to, aristotle, at, the, time, he, investigated, the, theory, of, definition, and, classification, and, the, quantification, of, the, predicates, of, categorical, propositions, and, developed, an, original, theory, on, temporal, modal, syllogism, its, premises, included, modifiers, such, as, at, all, times, at, most, times, and, at, some, time, while, avicenna, 980, 1037, often, relied, on, deductive, reasoning, in, philosophy, he, used, a, different, approach, in, medicine, ibn, sina, contributed, inventively, to, the, development, of, inductive, logic, which, he, used, to, pioneer, the, idea, of, a, syndrome, in, his, medical, writings, avicenna, was, the, first, to, describe, the, methods, of, agreement, difference, and, concomitant, variation, which, are, critical, to, inductive, logic, and, the, scientific, method, ibn, hazm, 994, 1064, wrote, the, scope, of, logic, in, which, he, stressed, on, the, importance, of, sense, perception, as, a, source, of, knowledge, al, ghazali, algazel, 1058, 1111, had, an, important, influence, on, the, use, of, logic, in, theology, making, use, of, avicennian, logic, in, kalam, fakhr, al, din, al, razi, b, 1149, criticised, aristotle, s, first, figure, and, developed, a, form, of, inductive, logic, foreshadowing, the, system, of, inductive, logic, developed, by, john, stuart, mill, 1806, 1873, systematic, refutations, of, greek, logic, were, written, by, the, illuminationist, school, founded, by, shahab, al, din, suhrawardi, 1155, 1191, who, developed, the, idea, of, decisive, necessity, an, important, innovation, in, the, history, of, logical, philosophical, speculation, and, in, favour, of, inductive, reasoning, avicenna, s, proof, for, the, existence, of, god, was, the, first, ontological, argument, which, he, proposed, in, the, metaphysics, section, of, the, book, of, healing, this, was, the, first, attempt, at, using, the, method, of, a, priori, proof, which, utilizes, intuition, and, reason, alone, avicenna, s, proof, of, god, s, existence, is, unique, in, that, it, can, be, classified, as, both, a, cosmological, argument, and, an, ontological, argument, it, is, ontological, insofar, as, necessary, existence, in, intellect, is, the, first, basis, for, arguing, for, a, necessary, existent, the, proof, is, also, cosmological, insofar, as, most, of, it, is, taken, up, with, arguing, that, contingent, existents, cannot, stand, alone, and, must, end, up, in, a, necessary, existent, theologians, particularly, among, the, mu, tazilites, agreed, with, aristotelian, metaphysics, that, non, existence, is, a, thing, s, h, ay, and, an, entity, d, h, t, according, to, aristotelian, philosophy, non, existence, has, to, be, distinguished, by, absolute, non, existence, that, is, absolute, nothingness, and, relative, non, existence, the, latter, can, refer, to, the, absence, of, a, quality, or, the, potentiality, of, something, mu, tazilites, such, as, al, f, r, b, and, ibn, s, n, hold, the, position, that, things, had, a, relative, existence, prior, to, creation, god, knew, what, he, was, going, to, create, and, god, gave, them, the, accident, of, existence, contrarily, asharites, regard, existence, as, essence, islamic, philosophy, imbued, as, it, is, with, islamic, theology, distinguishes, more, clearly, than, aristotelianism, the, difference, between, essence, and, existence, whereas, existence, is, the, domain, of, the, contingent, and, the, accidental, essence, endures, within, a, being, beyond, the, accidental, this, was, first, described, by, avicenna, s, works, on, metaphysics, who, was, himself, influenced, by, al, farabi, some, orientalists, or, those, particularly, influenced, by, thomist, scholarship, argued, that, avicenna, was, the, first, to, view, existence, wujud, as, an, accident, that, happens, to, the, essence, mahiyya, however, this, aspect, of, ontology, is, not, the, most, central, to, the, distinction, that, avicenna, established, between, essence, and, existence, one, cannot, therefore, make, the, claim, that, avicenna, was, the, proponent, of, the, concept, of, essentialism, per, se, given, that, existence, al, wujud, when, thought, of, in, terms, of, necessity, would, ontologically, translate, into, a, notion, of, the, necessary, existent, due, to, itself, wajib, al, wujud, bi, dhatihi, which, is, without, description, or, definition, and, in, particular, without, quiddity, or, essence, la, mahiyya, lahu, consequently, avicenna, s, ontology, is, existentialist, when, accounting, for, being, qua, existence, in, terms, of, necessity, wujub, while, it, is, essentialist, in, terms, of, thinking, about, being, qua, existence, in, terms, of, contingency, qua, possibility, imkan, or, mumkin, al, wujud, meaning, contingent, being, some, argue, that, avicenna, anticipated, frege, and, bertrand, russell, in, holding, that, existence, is, an, accident, of, accidents, and, also, anticipated, alexius, meinong, s, view, about, nonexistent, objects, he, also, provided, early, arguments, for, a, necessary, being, as, cause, of, all, other, existents, the, idea, of, essence, preced, existence, is, a, concept, which, dates, back, to, avicenna, and, his, school, as, well, as, shahab, al, din, suhrawardi, and, his, illuminationist, philosophy, existence, preced, essence, the, opposite, existentialist, notion, was, developed, in, the, works, of, averroes, and, mulla, sadra, s, transcendent, theosophy, ibn, al, nafis, wrote, the, theologus, autodidactus, as, a, defense, of, the, system, of, islam, and, the, muslims, doctrines, on, the, missions, of, prophets, the, religious, laws, the, resurrection, of, the, body, and, the, transitoriness, of, the, world, the, book, presents, rational, arguments, for, bodily, resurrection, and, the, immortality, of, the, human, soul, using, both, demonstrative, reasoning, and, material, from, the, hadith, corpus, as, forms, of, evidence, later, islamic, scholars, viewed, this, work, as, a, response, to, avicenna, s, metaphysical, argument, on, spiritual, resurrection, as, opposed, to, bodily, resurrection, which, was, earlier, criticized, by, al, ghazali, the, muslim, physician, philosophers, avicenna, and, ibn, al, nafis, developed, their, own, theories, on, the, soul, they, both, made, a, distinction, between, the, soul, and, the, spirit, and, in, particular, the, avicennian, doctrine, on, the, nature, of, the, soul, was, influential, among, the, scholastics, some, of, avicenna, s, views, on, the, soul, included, the, idea, that, the, immortality, of, the, soul, is, a, consequence, of, its, nature, and, not, a, purpose, for, it, to, fulfill, in, his, theory, of, the, ten, intellects, he, viewed, the, human, soul, as, the, tenth, and, final, intellect, avicenna, and, ibn, al, nafis, ibn, al, nafis, islamic, philosophers, and, physicians, who, followed, aristotle, put, forward, a, different, theory, about, the, soul, than, aristotle, s, and, made, a, distinction, between, soul, in, spirit, and, soul, in, soul, especially, avicenna, s, teaching, on, the, nature, of, the, soul, had, a, great, influence, on, the, scholastics, according, to, ibn, sina, the, soul, is, a, spiritual, substance, separate, from, the, body, it, uses, the, body, as, a, tool, the, famous, example, given, by, ibn, sina, to, show, that, the, soul, is, a, spiritual, substance, separate, from, the, material, body, and, to, show, one, s, self, awareness, is, known, as, insan, i, tair, flying, person, and, was, used, throughout, the, west, in, the, middle, ages, in, this, example, he, asks, his, readers, to, imagine, themselves, suspended, in, the, sky, in, the, air, without, any, sensory, contact, isolated, from, all, sensations, the, person, in, this, state, is, still, realizing, himself, even, though, there, is, no, material, contact, in, that, case, the, idea, that, the, soul, person, is, dependent, on, matter, that, is, any, physical, object, does, not, make, sense, and, the, soul, is, a, substance, on, its, own, here, the, concept, of, i, exist, even, though, i, am, not, in, the, dense, rough, matter, of, the, world, is, treated, this, proving, by, reflection, study, by, ibn, sina, was, later, simplified, by, ren, descartes, and, expressed, in, epistemological, terms, as, follows, i, can, isolate, myself, from, all, supposed, things, outside, of, me, but, i, can, never, abstract, from, my, own, consciousness, according, to, ibn, sina, immortality, of, the, soul, is, not, a, goal, but, a, necessity, and, consequence, of, its, nature, avicenna, generally, supported, aristotle, s, idea, of, the, soul, originating, from, the, heart, whereas, ibn, al, nafis, on, the, other, hand, rejected, this, idea, and, instead, argued, that, the, soul, is, related, to, the, entirety, and, not, to, one, or, a, few, organs, he, further, criticized, aristotle, s, idea, that, every, unique, soul, requires, the, existence, of, a, unique, source, in, this, case, the, heart, ibn, al, nafis, concluded, that, the, soul, is, related, primarily, neither, to, the, spirit, nor, to, any, organ, but, rather, to, the, entire, matter, whose, temperament, is, prepared, to, receive, that, soul, and, he, defined, the, soul, as, nothing, other, than, what, a, human, indicates, by, saying, i, while, he, was, imprisoned, in, the, castle, of, fardajan, near, hamadhan, avicenna, wrote, his, floating, man, thought, experiment, to, demonstrate, human, self, awareness, and, the, substantiality, of, the, soul, he, referred, to, the, living, human, intelligence, particularly, the, active, intellect, which, he, believed, to, be, the, hypostasis, by, which, god, communicates, truth, to, the, human, mind, and, imparts, order, and, intelligibility, to, nature, his, floating, man, thought, experiment, tells, its, readers, to, imagine, themselves, suspended, in, the, air, isolated, from, all, sensations, which, includes, no, sensory, contact, with, even, their, own, bodies, he, argues, that, in, this, scenario, one, would, still, have, self, consciousness, he, thus, concludes, that, the, idea, of, the, self, is, not, logically, dependent, on, any, physical, thing, and, that, the, soul, should, not, be, seen, in, relative, terms, but, as, a, primary, given, a, substance, this, argument, was, later, refined, and, simplified, by, ren, descartes, in, epistemic, terms, when, he, stated, i, can, abstract, from, the, supposition, of, all, external, things, but, not, from, the, supposition, of, my, own, consciousness, while, ancient, greek, philosophers, believed, that, the, universe, had, an, infinite, past, with, no, beginning, early, medieval, philosophers, and, theologians, developed, the, concept, of, the, universe, having, a, finite, past, with, a, beginning, this, view, was, inspired, by, the, creationism, shared, by, judaism, christianity, and, islam, the, christian, philosopher, john, philoponus, presented, a, detailed, argument, against, the, ancient, greek, notion, of, an, infinite, past, muslim, and, arab, jewish, philosophers, like, al, kindi, saadia, gaon, and, al, ghazali, developed, further, arguments, with, most, falling, into, two, broad, categories, assertions, of, the, impossibility, of, the, existence, of, an, actual, infinite, and, of, the, impossibility, of, completing, an, actual, infinite, by, successive, addition, in, metaphysics, avicenna, ibn, sina, defined, truth, as, what, corresponds, in, the, mind, to, what, is, outside, it, avicenna, elaborated, on, his, definition, of, truth, in, his, metaphysics, the, truth, of, a, thing, is, the, property, of, the, being, of, each, thing, which, has, been, established, in, it, in, his, quodlibeta, thomas, aquinas, wrote, a, commentary, on, avicenna, s, definition, of, truth, in, his, metaphysics, and, explained, it, as, follows, the, truth, of, each, thing, as, avicenna, says, in, his, metaphysica, is, nothing, else, than, the, property, of, its, being, which, has, been, established, in, it, so, that, is, called, true, gold, which, has, properly, the, being, of, gold, and, attains, to, the, established, determinations, of, the, nature, of, gold, now, each, thing, has, properly, being, in, some, nature, because, it, stands, under, the, complete, form, proper, to, that, nature, whereby, being, and, species, in, that, nature, is, early, islamic, political, philosophy, emphasized, an, inexorable, link, between, science, and, religion, and, the, process, of, ijtihad, to, find, truth, ibn, al, haytham, alhacen, reasoned, that, to, discover, the, truth, about, nature, it, is, necessary, to, eliminate, human, opinion, and, error, and, allow, the, universe, to, speak, for, itself, in, his, aporias, against, ptolemy, ibn, al, haytham, further, wrote, the, following, comments, on, truth, truth, is, sought, for, itself, the, truths, are, immersed, in, uncertainties, not, immune, from, error, therefore, the, seeker, after, the, truth, is, not, one, who, studies, the, writings, of, the, ancients, and, following, his, natural, disposition, puts, his, trust, in, them, but, rather, the, one, who, suspects, his, faith, in, them, and, questions, what, he, gathers, from, them, the, one, who, submits, to, argument, and, demonstration, and, not, to, the, sayings, of, a, human, being, whose, nature, is, fraught, with, all, kinds, of, imperfection, and, deficiency, thus, the, duty, of, the, man, who, investigates, the, writings, of, scientists, if, learning, the, truth, is, his, goal, is, to, make, himself, an, enemy, of, all, that, he, reads, and, applying, his, mind, to, the, core, and, margins, of, its, content, attack, it, from, every, side, he, should, also, suspect, himself, as, he, performs, his, critical, examination, of, it, so, that, he, may, avoid, falling, into, either, prejudice, or, leniency, i, constantly, sought, knowledge, and, truth, and, it, became, my, belief, that, for, gaining, access, to, the, effulgence, and, closeness, to, god, there, is, no, better, way, than, that, of, searching, for, truth, and, knowledge, the, issue, of, free, will, versus, predestination, is, one, of, the, most, contentious, topics, in, classical, islamic, thought, in, accordance, with, the, islamic, belief, in, predestination, or, divine, preordainment, al, qad, wa, l, qadar, god, has, full, knowledge, and, control, over, all, that, occurs, this, is, explained, in, qur, anic, verses, such, as, say, nothing, will, happen, to, us, except, what, allah, has, decreed, for, us, he, is, our, protector, for, muslims, everything, in, the, world, that, occurs, good, or, bad, has, been, preordained, and, nothing, can, happen, unless, permitted, by, god, according, to, muslim, theologians, although, events, are, pre, ordained, man, possesses, free, will, in, that, he, or, she, has, the, faculty, to, choose, between, right, and, wrong, and, is, thus, responsible, for, his, actions, according, to, islamic, tradition, all, that, has, been, decreed, by, god, is, written, in, al, lawh, al, mahf, z, the, preserved, tablet, atomistic, philosophies, are, found, very, early, in, islamic, philosophy, and, represent, a, synthesis, of, the, greek, and, indian, ideas, like, both, the, greek, and, indian, versions, islamic, atomism, was, a, charged, topic, that, had, the, potential, for, conflict, with, the, prevalent, religious, orthodoxy, yet, it, was, such, a, fertile, and, flexible, idea, that, as, in, greece, and, india, it, flourished, in, some, schools, of, islamic, thought, the, most, successful, form, of, islamic, atomism, was, in, the, asharite, school, of, philosophy, most, notably, in, the, work, of, the, philosopher, al, ghazali, 1058, 1111, in, asharite, atomism, atoms, are, the, only, perpetual, material, things, in, existence, and, all, else, in, the, world, is, accidental, meaning, something, that, lasts, for, only, an, instant, nothing, accidental, can, be, the, cause, of, anything, else, except, perception, as, it, exists, for, a, moment, contingent, events, are, not, subject, to, natural, physical, causes, but, are, the, direct, result, of, god, s, constant, intervention, without, which, nothing, could, happen, thus, nature, is, completely, dependent, on, god, which, meshes, with, other, asharite, islamic, ideas, on, causation, or, the, lack, thereof, other, traditions, in, islam, rejected, the, atomism, of, the, asharites, and, expounded, on, many, greek, texts, especially, those, of, aristotle, an, active, school, of, philosophers, in, spain, including, the, noted, commentator, averroes, 1126, 1198, ad, explicitly, rejected, the, thought, of, al, ghazali, and, turned, to, an, extensive, evaluation, of, the, thought, of, aristotle, averroes, commented, in, detail, on, most, of, the, works, of, aristotle, and, his, commentaries, did, much, to, guide, the, interpretation, of, aristotle, in, later, jewish, and, christian, scholastic, thought, there, are, several, cosmological, verses, in, the, qur, an, which, some, modern, writers, have, interpreted, as, foreshadowing, the, expansion, of, the, universe, and, possibly, even, the, big, bang, theory, do, the, disbelievers, not, realize, that, the, heavens, and, earth, were, once, one, mass, then, we, split, them, apart, and, we, created, from, water, every, living, thing, will, they, not, then, believe, we, built, the, universe, with, great, might, and, we, are, certainly, expanding, it, in, contrast, to, ancient, greek, philosophers, who, believed, that, the, universe, had, an, infinite, past, with, no, beginning, medieval, philosophers, and, theologians, developed, the, concept, of, the, universe, having, a, finite, past, with, a, beginning, this, view, was, inspired, by, the, creation, myth, shared, by, the, three, abrahamic, religions, judaism, christianity, and, islam, the, christian, philosopher, john, philoponus, presented, the, first, such, argument, against, the, ancient, greek, notion, of, an, infinite, past, his, reasoning, was, adopted, by, many, most, notably, muslim, philosopher, al, kindi, alkindus, the, jewish, philosopher, saadia, gaon, saadia, ben, joseph, and, the, muslim, theologian, al, ghazali, algazel, they, used, two, logical, arguments, against, an, infinite, past, the, first, being, the, argument, from, the, impossibility, of, the, existence, of, an, actual, infinite, which, states, the, second, argument, the, argument, from, the, impossibility, of, completing, an, actual, infinite, by, successive, addition, states, both, arguments, were, adopted, by, later, christian, philosophers, and, theologians, and, the, second, argument, in, particular, became, famous, after, it, was, adopted, by, immanuel, kant, in, his, thesis, of, the, first, antimony, concerning, time, in, the, 10th, century, the, brethren, of, purity, published, the, encyclopedia, of, the, brethren, of, purity, in, which, a, heliocentric, view, of, the, universe, is, expressed, in, a, section, on, cosmology, god, has, placed, the, sun, at, the, center, of, the, universe, just, as, the, capital, of, a, country, is, placed, in, its, middle, and, the, ruler, s, palace, at, the, center, of, the, city, cosmological, ideas, maintained, by, scholars, such, as, al, farabi, and, ibn, sina, have, strong, resemblance, with, the, neo, platonistic, emanation, cosmology, they, identified, the, different, intellects, dividing, the, cosmos, into, different, spheres, as, similar, to, the, islamic, angels, however, islamic, scholars, repeatedly, insist, that, all, heavenly, spheres, as, a, whole, form, a, single, body, and, are, moved, by, god, in, contrast, to, aristotelian, cosmology, in, which, god, only, moves, the, outer, sphere, according, to, ibn, sina, but, differing, from, al, farabi, god, is, not, part, of, the, scheme, of, emanation, god, emanated, things, in, accordance, with, his, will, in, his, theologia, aristotelis, he, shows, that, through, the, manifestation, of, god, the, intellects, are, aware, of, god, and, their, role, in, the, universe, further, ibn, sina, seems, to, distinguishes, between, two, types, of, angels, one, completely, unrelated, to, matter, and, another, one, which, exists, in, form, of, a, superior, kind, of, matter, the, latter, ones, can, carry, messages, between, the, heavenly, spheres, and, the, sublunary, world, appearing, in, visions, therefore, the, higher, angels, dwell, in, higher, spheres, while, their, subordinate, angels, appear, in, an, intermediary, realm, ibn, sina, s, explanation, might, imply, an, attempt, to, consider, revelation, as, part, of, the, natural, world, also, qazwini, lists, a, lower, type, of, angels, earthly, angels, as, indwelling, forces, of, nature, who, keep, the, world, in, order, and, never, deviate, from, their, duty, qazwini, believed, that, the, existence, of, these, angels, could, be, proved, by, reason, and, effects, of, these, angels, on, their, assigned, object, the, mu, tazili, scientist, and, philosopher, al, jahiz, c, 776, 869, was, the, only, known, medieval, arab, philosopher, to, write, on, topics, related, to, natural, selection, al, jahiz, s, ideas, on, the, struggle, for, existence, in, the, book, of, animals, have, been, summarized, as, follows, animals, engage, in, a, struggle, for, existence, for, resources, to, avoid, being, eaten, and, to, breed, environmental, factors, influence, organisms, to, develop, new, characteristics, to, ensure, survival, thus, transforming, into, new, species, animals, that, survive, to, breed, can, pass, on, their, successful, characteristics, to, offspring, however, according, to, frank, edgerton, 2002, the, claim, made, by, some, authors, that, al, jahiz, was, an, early, evolutionist, is, unconvincing, but, the, narrower, claim, that, jahiz, recognized, the, effect, of, environmental, factors, on, animal, life, seems, valid, rebecca, stott, 2013, writes, of, al, jahiz, s, work, jahiz, was, not, concerned, with, argument, or, theorizing, he, was, concerned, with, witnessing, jahiz, was, not, trying, to, work, out, how, the, world, began, or, how, species, had, come, to, be, he, believed, that, god, had, done, the, making, and, that, he, had, done, it, brilliantly, he, also, understood, what, we, might, call, the, survival, of, the, fittest, in, chapter, 47, of, india, entitled, on, vasudeva, and, the, wars, of, the, bharata, abu, rayhan, biruni, attempted, to, give, a, naturalistic, explanation, as, to, why, the, struggles, described, in, the, mahabharata, had, to, take, place, he, explains, it, using, natural, processes, that, include, biological, ideas, related, to, evolution, which, has, led, several, scholars, to, compare, his, ideas, to, darwinism, and, natural, selection, this, is, due, to, biruni, describing, the, idea, of, artificial, selection, and, then, applying, it, to, nature, the, agriculturist, selects, his, corn, letting, grow, as, much, as, he, requires, and, tearing, out, the, remainder, the, forester, leaves, those, branches, which, he, perceives, to, be, excellent, whilst, he, cuts, away, all, others, the, bees, kill, those, of, their, kind, who, only, eat, but, do, not, work, in, their, beehive, nature, proceeds, in, a, similar, way, however, it, does, not, distinguish, for, its, action, is, under, all, circumstances, one, and, the, same, it, allows, the, leaves, and, fruit, of, the, trees, to, perish, thus, preventing, them, from, realising, that, result, which, they, are, intended, to, produce, in, the, economy, of, nature, it, removes, them, so, as, to, make, room, for, others, in, the, 13th, century, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, explains, how, the, elements, evolved, into, minerals, then, plants, then, animals, and, then, humans, tusi, then, goes, on, to, explain, how, hereditary, variability, was, an, important, factor, for, biological, evolution, of, living, things, the, organisms, that, can, gain, the, new, features, faster, are, more, variable, as, a, result, they, gain, advantages, over, other, creatures, the, bodies, are, changing, as, a, result, of, the, internal, and, external, interactions, tusi, discusses, how, organisms, are, able, to, adapt, to, their, environments, look, at, the, world, of, animals, and, birds, they, have, all, that, is, necessary, for, defense, protection, and, daily, life, including, strengths, courage, and, appropriate, tools, some, of, these, organs, are, real, weapons, for, example, horns, spear, teeth, and, claws, knife, and, needle, feet, and, hoofs, cudgel, the, thorns, and, needles, of, some, animals, are, similar, to, arrows, animals, that, have, no, other, means, of, defense, as, the, gazelle, and, fox, protect, themselves, with, the, help, of, flight, and, cunning, some, of, them, for, example, bees, ants, and, some, bird, species, have, united, in, communities, in, order, to, protect, themselves, and, help, each, other, al, dinawari, 828, 896, considered, the, founder, of, arabic, botany, for, his, book, of, plants, discussed, plant, evolution, from, its, birth, to, its, death, describing, the, phases, of, plant, growth, and, the, production, of, flowers, and, fruit, ibn, miskawayh, s, al, fawz, al, asghar, and, the, brethren, of, purity, s, encyclopedia, of, the, brethren, of, purity, the, epistles, of, ikhwan, al, safa, developed, theories, on, evolution, that, possibly, had, an, influence, on, charles, darwin, and, his, inception, of, darwinism, but, has, at, one, time, been, criticized, as, overenthusiastic, state, that, god, first, created, matter, and, invested, it, with, energy, for, development, matter, therefore, adopted, the, form, of, vapour, which, assumed, the, shape, of, water, in, due, time, the, next, stage, of, development, was, mineral, life, different, kinds, of, stones, developed, in, course, of, time, their, highest, form, being, mirjan, coral, it, is, a, stone, which, has, in, it, branches, like, those, of, a, tree, after, mineral, life, evolves, vegetation, the, evolution, of, vegetation, culminates, with, a, tree, which, bears, the, qualities, of, an, animal, this, is, the, date, palm, it, has, male, and, female, genders, it, does, not, wither, if, all, its, branches, are, chopped, but, it, dies, when, the, head, is, cut, off, the, date, palm, is, therefore, considered, the, highest, among, the, trees, and, resembles, the, lowest, among, animals, then, is, born, the, lowest, of, animals, it, evolves, into, an, ape, this, is, not, the, statement, of, darwin, this, is, what, ibn, maskawayh, states, and, this, is, precisely, what, is, written, in, the, epistles, of, ikhwan, al, safa, the, muslim, thinkers, state, that, ape, then, evolved, into, a, lower, kind, of, a, barbarian, man, he, then, became, a, superior, human, being, man, becomes, a, saint, a, prophet, he, evolves, into, a, higher, stage, and, becomes, an, angel, the, one, higher, to, angels, is, indeed, none, but, god, everything, begins, from, him, and, everything, returns, to, him, english, translations, of, the, encyclopedia, of, the, brethren, of, purity, were, available, from, 1812, while, arabic, manuscripts, of, the, al, fawz, al, asghar, and, the, epistles, of, ikhwan, al, safa, were, also, available, at, the, university, of, cambridge, by, the, 19th, century, these, works, likely, had, an, influence, on, 19th, century, evolutionists, and, possibly, charles, darwin, in, the, 14th, century, ibn, khaldun, further, developed, the, evolutionary, ideas, found, in, the, encyclopedia, of, the, brethren, of, purity, the, following, statements, from, his, 1377, work, the, muqaddimah, express, evolutionary, ideas, we, explained, there, that, the, whole, of, existence, in, all, its, simple, and, composite, worlds, is, arranged, in, a, natural, order, of, ascent, and, descent, so, that, everything, constitutes, an, uninterrupted, continuum, the, essences, at, the, end, of, each, particular, stage, of, the, worlds, are, by, nature, prepared, to, be, transformed, into, the, essence, adjacent, to, them, either, above, or, below, them, this, is, the, case, with, the, simple, material, elements, it, is, the, case, with, palms, and, vines, which, constitute, the, last, stage, of, plants, in, their, relation, to, snails, and, shellfish, which, constitute, the, lowest, stage, of, animals, it, is, also, the, case, with, monkeys, creatures, combining, in, themselves, cleverness, and, perception, in, their, relation, to, man, the, being, who, has, the, ability, to, think, and, to, reflect, the, preparedness, for, transformation, that, exists, on, either, side, at, each, stage, of, the, worlds, is, meant, when, we, speak, about, their, connection, plants, do, not, have, the, same, fineness, and, power, that, animals, have, therefore, the, sages, rarely, turned, to, them, animals, are, the, last, and, final, stage, of, the, three, permutations, minerals, turn, into, plants, and, plants, into, animals, but, animals, cannot, turn, into, anything, finer, than, themselves, numerous, other, islamic, scholars, and, scientists, including, the, polymaths, ibn, al, haytham, and, al, khazini, discussed, and, developed, these, ideas, translated, into, latin, these, works, began, to, appear, in, the, west, after, the, renaissance, and, may, have, influenced, western, philosophy, and, science, the, polymath, ibn, al, haytham, alhacen, is, considered, a, pioneer, of, phenomenology, he, articulated, a, relationship, between, the, physical, and, observable, world, and, that, of, intuition, psychology, and, mental, functions, his, theories, regarding, knowledge, and, perception, linking, the, domains, of, science, and, religion, led, to, a, philosophy, of, existence, based, on, the, direct, observation, of, reality, from, the, observer, s, point, of, view, much, of, his, thought, on, phenomenology, was, not, further, developed, until, the, 20th, century, the, philosophy, of, mind, was, studied, in, medieval, islamic, psychological, thought, which, refers, to, the, study, of, the, nafs, literally, self, or, psyche, in, arabic, in, the, islamic, world, particularly, during, the, islamic, golden, age, 8th, 15th, centuries, as, well, as, modern, times, 20th, 21st, centuries, and, is, related, to, psychology, psychiatry, and, the, neurosciences, the, arab, polymath, al, hasan, ibn, al, haytham, alhazen, died, c, 1041, presented, a, thorough, mathematical, critique, and, refutation, of, aristotle, s, conception, of, place, topos, in, his, risala, qawl, fi, l, makan, treatise, discourse, on, place, aristotle, s, physics, book, iv, delta, stated, that, the, place, of, something, is, the, two, dimensional, boundary, of, the, containing, body, that, is, at, rest, and, is, in, contact, with, what, it, contains, ibn, al, haytham, disagreed, with, this, definition, and, demonstrated, that, place, al, makan, is, the, imagined, three, dimensional, void, al, khala, al, mutakhayyal, between, the, inner, surfaces, of, the, containing, body, he, showed, that, place, was, akin, to, space, foreshadowing, descartes, s, notion, of, place, as, space, qua, extensio, or, even, leibniz, s, analysis, situs, ibn, al, haytham, s, mathematization, of, place, rested, on, several, geometric, demonstrations, including, his, study, on, the, sphere, and, other, solids, which, showed, that, the, sphere, al, kura, is, the, largest, in, magnitude, volumetric, with, respect, to, other, geometric, solids, that, have, equal, surface, areas, for, instance, a, sphere, that, has, an, equal, surface, area, to, that, of, a, cylinder, would, be, larger, in, volumetric, magnitude, than, the, cylinder, hence, the, sphere, occupies, a, larger, place, than, that, occupied, by, the, cylinder, unlike, what, is, entailed, by, aristotle, s, definition, of, place, that, this, sphere, and, that, cylinder, occupy, places, that, are, equal, in, magnitude, ibn, al, haytham, rejected, aristotle, s, philosophical, concept, of, place, on, mathematical, grounds, later, the, philosopher, abd, al, latif, al, baghdadi, 13th, century, tried, to, defend, the, aristotelian, conception, of, place, in, a, treatise, titled, fi, al, radd, ala, ibn, al, haytham, fi, al, makan, a, refutation, of, ibn, al, haytham, s, place, although, his, effort, was, admirable, from, a, philosophical, standpoint, it, was, unconvincing, from, the, scientific, and, mathematical, viewpoints, ibn, al, haytham, also, discussed, space, perception, and, its, epistemological, implications, in, his, book, of, optics, 1021, his, experimental, proof, of, the, intromission, model, of, vision, led, to, changes, in, the, way, the, visual, perception, of, space, was, understood, contrary, to, the, previous, emission, theory, of, vision, supported, by, euclid, and, ptolemy, in, tying, the, visual, perception, of, space, to, prior, bodily, experience, alhacen, unequivocally, rejected, the, intuitiveness, of, spatial, perception, and, therefore, the, autonomy, of, vision, without, tangible, notions, of, distance, and, size, for, correlation, sight, can, tell, us, next, to, nothing, about, such, things, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, an, elementary, school, was, known, as, a, maktab, which, dates, back, to, at, least, the, 10th, century, like, madrasahs, which, referred, to, higher, education, a, maktab, was, often, attached, to, a, mosque, in, the, 11th, century, ibn, sina, known, as, avicenna, in, the, west, in, one, of, his, books, wrote, a, chapter, dealing, with, the, maktab, entitled, the, role, of, the, teacher, in, the, training, and, upbringing, of, children, as, a, guide, to, teachers, working, at, maktab, schools, he, wrote, that, children, can, learn, better, if, taught, in, classes, instead, of, individual, tuition, from, private, tutors, and, he, gave, a, number, of, reasons, for, why, this, is, the, case, citing, the, value, of, competition, and, emulation, among, pupils, as, well, as, the, usefulness, of, group, discussions, and, debates, ibn, sina, described, the, curriculum, of, a, maktab, school, in, some, detail, describing, the, curricula, for, two, stages, of, education, in, a, maktab, school, ibn, sina, wrote, that, children, should, be, sent, to, a, maktab, school, from, the, age, of, 6, and, be, taught, primary, education, until, they, reach, the, age, of, 14, during, which, time, he, wrote, that, they, should, be, taught, the, qur, an, islamic, metaphysics, language, literature, islamic, ethics, and, manual, skills, which, could, refer, to, a, variety, of, practical, skills, ibn, sina, refers, to, the, secondary, education, stage, of, maktab, schooling, as, the, period, of, specialization, when, pupils, should, begin, to, acquire, manual, skills, regardless, of, their, social, status, he, writes, that, children, after, the, age, of, 14, should, be, given, a, choice, to, choose, and, specialize, in, subjects, they, have, an, interest, in, whether, it, was, reading, manual, skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade, and, commerce, craftsmanship, or, any, other, subject, or, profession, they, would, be, interested, in, pursuing, for, a, future, career, he, wrote, that, this, was, a, transitional, stage, and, that, there, needs, to, be, flexibility, regarding, the, age, in, which, pupils, graduate, as, the, student, s, emotional, development, and, chosen, subjects, need, to, be, taken, into, account, the, pioneering, development, of, the, scientific, method, by, the, arab, ash, ari, polymath, ibn, al, haytham, alhacen, was, an, important, contribution, to, the, philosophy, of, science, in, the, book, of, optics, c, 1025, ce, his, scientific, method, was, very, similar, to, the, modern, scientific, method, and, consisted, of, the, following, procedures, in, the, model, of, the, motions, ibn, al, haytham, also, describes, an, early, version, of, occam, s, razor, where, he, employs, only, minimal, hypotheses, regarding, the, properties, that, characterize, astronomical, motions, as, he, attempts, to, eliminate, from, his, planetary, model, the, cosmological, hypotheses, that, cannot, be, observed, from, earth, in, aporias, against, ptolemy, ibn, al, haytham, commented, on, the, difficulty, of, attaining, scientific, knowledge, truth, is, sought, for, itself, the, truths, are, immersed, in, uncertainties, not, immune, from, error, he, held, that, the, criticism, of, existing, theories, which, dominated, this, book, holds, a, special, place, in, the, growth, of, scientific, knowledge, therefore, the, seeker, after, the, truth, is, not, one, who, studies, the, writings, of, the, ancients, and, following, his, natural, disposition, puts, his, trust, in, them, but, rather, the, one, who, suspects, his, faith, in, them, and, questions, what, he, gathers, from, them, the, one, who, submits, to, argument, and, demonstration, and, not, to, the, sayings, of, a, human, being, whose, nature, is, fraught, with, all, kinds, of, imperfection, and, deficiency, thus, the, duty, of, the, man, who, investigates, the, writings, of, scientists, if, learning, the, truth, is, his, goal, is, to, make, himself, an, enemy, of, all, that, he, reads, and, applying, his, mind, to, the, core, and, margins, of, its, content, attack, it, from, every, side, he, should, also, suspect, himself, as, he, performs, his, critical, examination, of, it, so, that, he, may, avoid, falling, into, either, prejudice, or, leniency, ibn, al, haytham, attributed, his, experimental, scientific, method, and, scientific, skepticism, to, his, islamic, faith, he, believed, that, human, beings, are, inherently, flawed, and, that, only, god, is, perfect, he, reasoned, that, to, discover, the, truth, about, nature, it, is, necessary, to, eliminate, human, opinion, and, error, and, allow, the, universe, to, speak, for, itself, in, the, winding, motion, ibn, al, haytham, further, wrote, that, faith, should, only, apply, to, prophets, of, islam, and, not, to, any, other, authorities, in, the, following, comparison, between, the, islamic, prophetic, tradition, and, the, demonstrative, sciences, from, the, statements, made, by, the, noble, shaykh, it, is, clear, that, he, believes, in, ptolemy, s, words, in, everything, he, says, without, relying, on, a, demonstration, or, calling, on, a, proof, but, by, pure, imitation, taqlid, that, is, how, experts, in, the, prophetic, tradition, have, faith, in, prophets, may, the, blessing, of, god, be, upon, them, but, it, is, not, the, way, that, mathematicians, have, faith, in, specialists, in, the, demonstrative, sciences, ibn, al, haytham, described, his, search, for, truth, and, knowledge, as, a, way, of, leading, him, closer, to, god, i, constantly, sought, knowledge, and, truth, and, it, became, my, belief, that, for, gaining, access, to, the, effulgence, and, closeness, to, god, there, is, no, better, way, than, that, of, searching, for, truth, and, knowledge, his, contemporary, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, also, introduced, an, early, scientific, method, in, nearly, every, field, of, inquiry, he, studied, for, example, in, his, treatise, on, mineralogy, kitab, al, jamahir, book, of, precious, stones, he, is, the, most, exact, of, experimental, scientists, while, in, the, introduction, to, his, study, of, india, he, declares, that, to, execute, our, project, it, has, not, been, possible, to, follow, the, geometric, method, and, develops, comparative, sociology, as, a, scientific, method, in, the, field, he, was, also, responsible, for, introducing, the, experimental, method, into, mechanics, the, first, to, conduct, elaborate, experiments, related, to, astronomical, phenomena, and, a, pioneer, of, experimental, psychology, unlike, his, contemporary, avicenna, s, scientific, method, where, general, and, universal, questions, came, first, and, led, to, experimental, work, al, biruni, developed, scientific, methods, where, universals, came, out, of, practical, experimental, work, and, theories, are, formulated, after, discoveries, during, his, debate, with, avicenna, on, natural, philosophy, al, biruni, made, the, first, real, distinction, between, a, scientist, and, a, philosopher, referring, to, avicenna, as, a, philosopher, and, considering, himself, to, be, a, mathematical, scientist, al, biruni, s, scientific, method, was, similar, to, the, modern, scientific, method, in, many, ways, particularly, his, emphasis, on, repeated, experimentation, biruni, was, concerned, with, how, to, conceptualize, and, prevent, both, systematic, errors, and, random, errors, such, as, errors, caused, by, the, use, of, small, instruments, and, errors, made, by, human, observers, he, argued, that, if, instruments, produce, random, errors, because, of, their, imperfections, or, idiosyncratic, qualities, then, multiple, observations, must, be, taken, analyzed, qualitatively, and, on, this, basis, arrive, at, a, common, sense, single, value, for, the, constant, sought, whether, an, arithmetic, mean, or, a, reliable, estimate, avicenna, ibn, sina, is, considered, the, father, of, modern, medicine, for, his, introduction, of, experimental, medicine, and, clinical, trials, the, experimental, use, and, testing, of, drugs, and, a, precise, guide, for, practical, experimentation, in, the, process, of, discovering, and, proving, the, effectiveness, of, medical, substances, in, his, medical, encyclopedia, the, canon, of, medicine, 11th, century, which, was, the, first, book, dealing, with, experimental, medicine, it, laid, out, the, following, rules, and, principles, for, testing, the, effectiveness, of, new, drugs, or, medications, which, still, form, the, basis, of, modern, clinical, trials, the, first, documented, description, of, a, peer, review, process, is, found, in, the, ethics, of, the, physician, written, by, ishaq, bin, ali, al, rahwi, 854, 931, of, al, raha, syria, who, describes, the, first, medical, peer, review, process, his, work, as, well, as, later, arabic, medical, manuals, state, that, a, visiting, physician, must, always, make, duplicate, notes, of, a, patient, s, condition, on, every, visit, when, the, patient, was, cured, or, had, died, the, notes, of, the, physician, were, examined, by, a, local, medical, council, of, other, physicians, who, would, review, the, practising, physician, s, notes, to, decide, whether, his, her, performance, have, met, the, required, standards, of, medical, care, if, their, reviews, were, negative, the, practicing, physician, could, face, a, lawsuit, from, a, maltreated, patient, avicenna, s, most, influential, theory, in, epistemology, is, his, theory, of, knowledge, in, which, he, developed, the, concept, of, tabula, rasa, he, argued, that, the, human, intellect, at, birth, is, rather, like, a, tabula, rasa, a, pure, potentiality, that, is, actualized, through, education, and, comes, to, know, and, that, knowledge, is, attained, through, empirical, familiarity, with, objects, in, this, world, from, which, one, abstracts, universal, concepts, which, is, developed, through, a, syllogistic, method, of, reasoning, observations, lead, to, prepositional, statements, which, when, compounded, lead, to, further, abstract, concepts, in, the, 12th, century, ibn, tufail, further, developed, the, concept, of, tabula, rasa, in, his, arabic, novel, hayy, ibn, yaqzan, in, which, he, depicted, the, development, of, the, mind, of, a, feral, child, from, a, tabula, rasa, to, that, of, an, adult, in, complete, isolation, from, society, on, a, desert, island, the, latin, translation, of, his, work, entitled, philosophus, autodidactus, published, by, edward, pococke, the, younger, in, 1671, had, an, influence, on, john, locke, s, formulation, of, tabula, rasa, in, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, islamic, eschatology, is, concerned, with, the, qiyamah, end, of, the, world, last, judgement, and, the, final, judgement, of, humanity, eschatology, relates, to, one, of, the, six, articles, of, faith, aqidah, of, islam, like, the, other, abrahamic, religions, islam, teaches, the, bodily, resurrection, of, the, dead, the, fulfillment, of, a, divine, plan, for, creation, and, the, immortality, of, the, human, soul, though, jews, do, not, necessarily, view, the, soul, as, eternal, the, righteous, are, rewarded, with, the, pleasures, of, jannah, heaven, while, the, unrighteous, are, punished, in, jahannam, hell, a, significant, fraction, one, third, in, fact, of, the, quran, deals, with, these, beliefs, with, many, hadith, elaborating, on, the, themes, and, details, islamic, apocalyptic, literature, describing, the, armageddon, is, often, known, as, fitna, a, test, and, malahim, or, ghayba, in, the, shi, a, tradition, ibn, al, nafis, dealt, with, islamic, eschatology, in, some, depth, in, his, theologus, autodidactus, where, he, rationalized, the, islamic, view, of, eschatology, using, reason, and, science, to, explain, the, events, that, would, occur, according, to, islamic, eschatology, he, presented, his, rational, and, scientific, arguments, in, the, form, of, arabic, fiction, hence, his, theologus, autodidactus, may, be, considered, the, earliest, science, fiction, work, sharia, refers, to, the, body, of, islamic, law, the, term, means, way, or, path, it, is, the, legal, framework, within, which, public, and, some, private, aspects, of, life, are, regulated, for, those, living, in, a, legal, system, based, on, islamic, principles, of, jurisprudence, fiqh, is, the, term, for, islamic, jurisprudence, made, up, of, the, rulings, of, islamic, jurists, a, component, of, islamic, studies, fiqh, expounds, the, methodology, by, which, islamic, law, is, derived, from, primary, and, secondary, sources, mainstream, islam, distinguish, fiqh, which, means, understanding, details, and, inferences, drawn, by, scholars, from, sharia, that, refers, to, principles, that, lie, behind, the, fiqh, scholars, hope, that, fiqh, and, sharia, are, in, harmony, in, any, given, case, but, they, cannot, be, sure, the, islamic, philosophers, ibn, tufail, abubacer, and, ibn, al, nafis, were, pioneers, of, the, philosophical, novel, ibn, tufail, wrote, the, first, fictional, arabic, novel, hayy, ibn, yaqdhan, philosophus, autodidactus, as, a, response, to, al, ghazali, s, the, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, and, then, ibn, al, nafis, also, wrote, a, fictional, novel, theologus, autodidactus, as, a, response, to, ibn, tufail, s, philosophus, autodidactus, both, of, these, novels, had, protagonists, hayy, in, philosophus, autodidactus, and, kamil, in, theologus, autodidactus, who, were, autodidactic, individuals, spontaneously, generated, in, a, cave, and, living, in, seclusion, on, a, desert, island, both, being, the, earliest, examples, of, a, desert, island, story, however, while, hayy, lives, alone, on, the, desert, island, for, most, of, the, story, in, philosophus, autodidactus, the, story, of, kamil, extends, beyond, the, desert, island, setting, in, theologus, autodidactus, developing, into, the, first, example, of, a, science, fiction, novel, ibn, al, nafis, described, his, book, theologus, autodidactus, as, a, defense, of, the, system, of, islam, and, the, muslims, doctrines, on, the, missions, of, prophets, the, religious, laws, the, resurrection, of, the, body, and, the, transitoriness, of, the, world, he, presents, rational, arguments, for, bodily, resurrection, and, the, immortality, of, the, human, soul, using, both, demonstrative, reasoning, and, material, from, the, hadith, corpus, to, prove, his, case, later, islamic, scholars, viewed, this, work, as, a, response, to, the, metaphysical, claim, of, avicenna, and, ibn, tufail, that, bodily, resurrection, cannot, be, proven, through, reason, a, view, that, was, earlier, criticized, by, al, ghazali, a, latin, translation, of, philosophus, autodidactus, was, published, in, 1671, prepared, by, edward, pococke, the, younger, the, first, english, translation, by, simon, ockley, was, published, in, 1708, and, german, and, dutch, translations, were, also, published, at, the, time, philosophus, autodidactus, went, on, to, have, a, significant, influence, on, european, literature, and, became, an, influential, best, seller, throughout, western, europe, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, these, translations, later, inspired, daniel, defoe, to, write, robinson, crusoe, which, also, featured, a, desert, island, narrative, and, was, regarded, as, the, first, novel, in, english, philosophus, autodidactus, also, had, a, profound, influence, on, modern, western, philosophy, it, became, one, of, the, most, important, books, that, heralded, the, scientific, revolution, and, european, enlightenment, and, the, thoughts, expressed, in, the, novel, can, be, found, in, different, variations, and, to, different, degrees, in, the, books, of, thomas, hobbes, john, locke, isaac, newton, and, immanuel, kant, the, novel, inspired, the, concept, of, tabula, rasa, developed, in, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, 1690, by, locke, who, was, a, student, of, pococke, philosophus, autodidactus, also, developed, the, themes, of, empiricism, tabula, rasa, nature, versus, nurture, condition, of, possibility, materialism, and, molyneux, s, problem, the, novel, also, inspired, robert, boyle, another, acquaintance, of, pococke, to, write, his, own, philosophical, novel, set, on, an, island, the, aspiring, naturalist, other, european, scholars, influenced, by, philosophus, autodidactus, include, gottfried, leibniz, melchis, dech, th, venot, john, wallis, christiaan, huygens, george, keith, robert, barclay, the, quakers, and, samuel, hartlib, early, islamic, political, philosophy, emphasized, an, inexorable, link, between, science, and, religion, and, the, process, of, ijtihad, to, find, truth, in, effect, all, philosophy, was, political, as, it, had, real, implications, for, governance, this, view, was, challenged, by, the, mutazilite, philosophers, who, held, a, more, secular, view, and, were, supported, by, secular, aristocracy, who, sought, freedom, of, action, independent, of, the, caliphate, the, only, greek, political, treatise, known, to, medieval, muslims, at, the, time, was, plato, s, republic, and, the, laws, by, the, end, of, the, islamic, golden, age, however, the, asharite, view, of, islam, had, in, general, triumphed, islamic, political, philosophy, was, indeed, rooted, in, the, very, sources, of, islam, i, e, the, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, the, words, and, practices, of, muhammad, however, in, the, western, thought, it, is, generally, known, that, it, was, a, specific, area, peculiar, merely, to, the, great, philosophers, of, islam, al, kindi, alkindus, al, farabi, alfarabi, bn, sina, avicenna, ibn, bajjah, avempace, ibn, rushd, averroes, and, ibn, khaldun, the, political, conceptions, of, islam, such, as, kudrah, sultan, ummah, cemaa, and, even, the, core, terms, of, the, qur, an, i, e, ibada, din, rab, and, ilah, is, taken, as, the, basis, of, an, analysis, hence, not, only, the, ideas, of, the, muslim, political, philosophers, but, also, many, other, jurists, and, ulama, posed, political, ideas, and, theories, for, example, the, ideas, of, the, khawarij, in, the, very, early, years, of, islamic, history, on, khilafa, and, ummah, or, that, of, shia, islam, on, the, concept, of, imamah, are, considered, proofs, of, political, thought, the, clashes, between, the, ehl, i, sunna, and, shia, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, had, a, genuine, political, character, the, 14th, century, arab, scholar, ibn, khaldun, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, political, theorists, the, british, philosopher, anthropologist, ernest, gellner, considered, ibn, khaldun, s, definition, of, government, an, institution, which, prevents, injustice, other, than, such, as, it, commits, itself, the, best, in, the, history, of, political, theory, the, first, detailed, studies, on, the, subject, of, historiography, and, the, first, critiques, on, historical, methods, appeared, in, the, works, of, the, arab, ash, ari, polymath, ibn, khaldun, 1332, 1406, who, is, regarded, as, the, father, of, historiography, cultural, history, and, the, philosophy, of, history, especially, for, his, historiographical, writings, in, the, muqaddimah, latinized, as, prolegomena, and, kitab, al, ibar, book, of, advice, his, muqaddimah, also, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, observation, of, the, role, of, state, communication, propaganda, and, systematic, bias, in, history, and, he, discussed, the, rise, and, fall, of, civilizations, franz, rosenthal, wrote, in, the, history, of, muslim, historiography, muslim, historiography, has, at, all, times, been, united, by, the, closest, ties, with, the, general, development, of, scholarship, in, islam, and, the, position, of, historical, knowledge, in, musiim, education, has, exercised, a, decisive, influence, upon, the, intellectual, level, of, historicai, writing, the, muslims, achieved, a, definite, advance, beyond, previous, historical, writing, in, the, sociological, understanding, of, history, and, the, systematisation, of, historiography, the, development, of, modern, historical, writing, seems, to, have, gained, considerably, in, speed, and, substance, through, the, utilization, of, a, muslim, literature, which, enabled, western, historians, from, the, 17th, century, on, to, see, a, large, section, of, the, world, through, foreign, eyes, the, muslim, historiography, helped, indirectly, and, modestly, to, shape, present, day, historical, thinking, there, is, an, important, question, on, the, relation, of, religion, and, philosophy, reason, and, faith, and, so, on, in, one, hand, there, is, extraordinary, importance, attached, to, religion, in, islamic, civilization, and, in, other, hand, they, created, certain, doctrines, in, respect, to, reason, and, religion, the, social, philosopher, and, ash, ari, polymath, ibn, khaldun, 1332, 1406, was, the, last, major, islamic, philosopher, from, tunis, north, africa, in, his, muqaddimah, he, developed, the, earliest, theories, on, social, philosophy, in, formulating, theories, of, social, cohesion, and, social, conflict, his, muqaddimah, was, also, the, introduction, to, a, seven, volume, analysis, of, universal, history, ibn, khaldun, is, considered, the, father, of, sociology, father, of, historiography, and, father, of, the, philosophy, of, history, by, some, for, allegedly, being, the, first, to, discuss, the, topics, of, sociology, historiography, and, the, philosophy, of, history, in, detail, islamic, philosophy, found, an, audience, with, the, jews, to, whom, belongs, the, honor, of, having, transmitted, it, to, the, christian, world, a, series, of, eminent, men, such, as, the, ibn, tibbons, narboni, gersonides, joined, in, translating, the, arabic, philosophical, works, into, hebrew, and, commenting, upon, them, the, works, of, ibn, rushd, especially, became, the, subject, of, their, study, due, in, great, measure, to, maimonides, who, in, a, letter, addressed, to, his, pupil, joseph, ben, judah, spoke, in, the, highest, terms, of, ibn, rushd, s, commentary, the, oldest, jewish, religio, philosophical, work, preserved, in, arabic, is, that, of, saadia, gaon, 892, 942, emunot, ve, deot, the, book, of, beliefs, and, opinions, in, this, work, saadia, treats, the, questions, that, interested, the, mutakallamin, such, as, the, creation, of, matter, the, unity, of, god, the, divine, attributes, the, soul, etc, saadia, criticizes, other, philosophers, severely, for, saadia, there, was, no, problem, as, to, creation, god, created, the, world, ex, nihilo, just, as, the, bible, attests, and, he, contests, the, theory, of, the, mutakallamin, in, reference, to, atoms, which, theory, he, declares, is, just, as, contrary, to, reason, and, religion, as, the, theory, of, the, philosophers, professing, the, eternity, of, matter, to, prove, the, unity, of, god, saadia, uses, the, demonstrations, of, the, mutakallamin, only, the, attributes, of, essence, sifat, al, dhatia, can, be, ascribed, to, god, but, not, the, attributes, of, action, sifat, al, fi, aliya, the, soul, is, a, substance, more, delicate, even, than, that, of, the, celestial, spheres, here, saadia, controverts, the, mutakallamin, who, considered, the, soul, an, accident, arad, compare, guide, for, the, perplexed, i, 74, and, employs, the, following, one, of, their, premises, to, justify, his, position, only, a, substance, can, be, the, substratum, of, an, accident, that, is, of, a, non, essential, property, of, things, saadia, argues, if, the, soul, be, an, accident, only, it, can, itself, have, no, such, accidents, as, wisdom, joy, love, etc, saadia, was, thus, in, every, way, a, supporter, of, the, kalam, and, if, at, times, he, deviated, from, its, doctrines, it, was, owing, to, his, religious, views, since, no, idea, and, no, literary, or, philosophical, movement, ever, germinated, on, persian, or, arabian, soil, without, leaving, its, impress, on, the, jews, al, ghazali, found, an, imitator, in, the, person, of, judah, ha, levi, this, poet, also, took, upon, himself, to, free, his, religion, from, what, he, saw, as, the, shackles, of, speculative, philosophy, and, to, this, end, wrote, the, kuzari, in, which, he, sought, to, discredit, all, schools, of, philosophy, alike, he, passes, severe, censure, upon, the, mutakallimun, for, seeking, to, support, religion, by, philosophy, he, says, i, consider, him, to, have, attained, the, highest, degree, of, perfection, who, is, convinced, of, religious, truths, without, having, scrutinized, them, and, reasoned, over, them, kuzari, v, then, he, reduced, the, chief, propositions, of, the, mutakallamin, to, prove, the, unity, of, god, to, ten, in, number, describing, them, at, length, and, concluding, in, these, terms, does, the, kalam, give, us, more, information, concerning, god, and, his, attributes, than, the, prophet, did, ib, iii, and, iv, aristotelianism, finds, no, favor, in, judah, ha, levi, s, eyes, for, it, is, no, less, given, to, details, and, criticism, neoplatonism, alone, suited, him, somewhat, owing, to, its, appeal, to, his, poetic, temperament, similarly, the, reaction, in, favour, of, stricter, aristotelianism, as, found, in, averroes, had, its, jewish, counterpart, in, the, work, of, maimonides, later, jewish, philosophers, such, as, gersonides, and, elijah, delmedigo, followed, the, school, of, averroes, and, played, a, part, in, transmitting, averroist, thought, to, medieval, europe, in, spain, and, italy, jewish, translators, such, as, abraham, de, balmes, and, jacob, mantino, translated, arabic, philosophic, literature, into, hebrew, and, latin, contributing, to, the, development, of, modern, european, philosophy, the, death, of, ibn, rushd, averro, s, effectively, marks, the, end, of, a, particular, discipline, of, islamic, philosophy, usually, called, the, peripatetic, arabic, school, and, philosophical, activity, declined, significantly, in, western, islamic, countries, namely, in, islamic, spain, and, north, africa, though, it, persisted, for, much, longer, in, the, eastern, countries, in, particular, iran, and, india, contrary, to, the, traditional, view, dimitri, gutas, and, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, consider, the, period, between, the, 11th, and, 14th, centuries, to, be, the, true, golden, age, of, arabic, and, islamic, philosophy, initiated, by, al, ghazali, s, successful, integration, of, logic, into, the, madrasah, curriculum, and, the, subsequent, rise, of, avicennism, since, the, political, power, shift, in, western, europe, spain, and, portugal, from, muslim, to, christian, control, the, muslims, naturally, did, not, practice, philosophy, in, western, europe, this, also, led, to, some, loss, of, contact, between, the, west, and, the, east, of, the, islamic, world, muslims, in, the, east, continued, to, do, philosophy, as, is, evident, from, the, works, of, ottoman, scholars, and, especially, those, living, in, muslim, kingdoms, within, the, territories, of, present, day, iran, and, india, such, as, shah, waliullah, and, ahmad, sirhindi, this, fact, has, escaped, most, pre, modern, historians, of, islamic, or, arabic, philosophy, in, addition, logic, has, continued, to, be, taught, in, religious, seminaries, up, to, modern, times, after, ibn, rushd, there, arose, many, later, schools, of, islamic, philosophy, such, as, those, founded, by, ibn, arabi, and, shi, ite, mulla, sadra, these, new, schools, are, of, particular, importance, as, they, are, still, active, in, the, islamic, world, the, most, important, among, them, are, illuminationist, philosophy, was, a, school, of, islamic, philosophy, founded, by, shahab, al, din, suhrawardi, in, the, 12th, century, this, school, is, a, combination, of, avicenna, s, philosophy, and, ancient, iranian, philosophy, with, many, new, innovative, ideas, of, suhrawardi, it, is, often, described, as, having, been, influenced, by, neoplatonism, in, logic, in, islamic, philosophy, systematic, refutations, of, greek, logic, were, written, by, the, illuminationist, school, founded, by, shahab, al, din, suhrawardi, 1155, 1191, who, developed, the, idea, of, decisive, necessity, an, important, innovation, in, the, history, of, logical, philosophical, speculation, transcendent, theosophy, is, the, school, of, islamic, philosophy, founded, by, mulla, sadra, in, the, 17th, century, his, philosophy, and, ontology, is, considered, to, be, just, as, important, to, islamic, philosophy, as, martin, heidegger, s, philosophy, later, was, to, western, philosophy, in, the, 20th, century, mulla, sadra, bought, a, new, philosophical, insight, in, dealing, with, the, nature, of, reality, and, created, a, major, transition, from, essentialism, to, existentialism, in, islamic, philosophy, several, centuries, before, this, occurred, in, western, philosophy, the, idea, of, essence, precedes, existence, is, a, concept, which, dates, back, to, ibn, sina, avicenna, and, his, school, of, avicennism, as, well, as, shahab, al, din, suhrawardi, and, his, illuminationist, philosophy, the, opposite, idea, of, existence, precedes, essence, was, thus, developed, in, the, works, of, averroes, and, mulla, sadra, as, a, reaction, to, this, idea, and, is, a, key, foundational, concept, of, existentialism, for, mulla, sadra, existence, precedes, the, essence, and, is, thus, principle, since, something, has, to, exist, first, and, then, have, an, essence, this, is, primarily, the, argument, that, lies, at, the, heart, of, mulla, sadra, s, transcendent, theosophy, sayyid, jalal, ashtiyani, later, summarized, mulla, sadra, s, concept, as, follows, the, existent, being, that, has, an, essence, must, then, be, caused, and, existence, that, is, pure, existence, is, therefore, a, necessary, being, more, careful, approaches, are, needed, in, terms, of, thinking, about, philosophers, and, theologians, in, islam, in, terms, of, phenomenological, methods, of, investigation, in, ontology, or, onto, theology, or, by, way, of, comparisons, that, are, made, with, heidegger, s, thought, and, his, critique, of, the, history, of, metaphysics, the, tradition, of, islamic, philosophy, is, still, very, much, alive, today, particularly, among, followers, of, suhrawardi, s, hikmat, al, ishraq, illumination, philosophy, and, mulla, sadra, s, hikmat, e, mota, aliye, transcendent, theosophy, another, figure, is, muhammad, iqbal, who, reshaped, and, revitalized, islamic, philosophy, among, the, muslims, of, the, indian, sub, continent, in, the, early, 20th, century, his, the, reconstruction, of, religious, thought, in, islam, is, a, milestone, in, the, modern, political, philosophy, of, islam, in, contemporary, islamic, regions, the, teaching, of, hikmat, or, hikmah, has, continued, to, flourish, in, the, contemporary, era, some, people, like, the, ali, shariati, have, considered, islamic, philosophy, as, realism, but, there, is, also, a, belief, that, islam, is, beyond, all, of, other, isms, philosophy, has, not, been, without, criticism, amongst, muslims, both, contemporary, and, past, the, imam, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, for, whom, the, hanbali, school, of, thought, is, named, rebuked, philosophical, discussion, once, telling, proponents, of, it, that, he, was, secure, in, his, religion, but, that, they, were, in, doubt, so, go, to, a, doubter, and, argue, with, him, instead, today, islamic, philosophical, thought, has, also, been, criticized, by, scholars, of, the, modern, salafi, movement, there, would, be, many, islamic, thinkers, who, were, not, enthusiastic, about, the, potential, of, philosophy, but, it, would, be, incorrect, to, assume, that, they, opposed, it, simply, because, it, was, a, foreign, science, oliver, leaman, an, expert, on, islamic, philosophy, points, out, that, the, objections, of, notable, theologians, are, rarely, directed, at, philosophy, itself, but, rather, at, the, conclusions, the, philosophers, arrived, at, even, the, 11th, century, al, ghazali, known, for, his, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, critique, of, philosophers, was, himself, an, expert, in, philosophy, and, logic, his, criticism, was, that, they, arrived, at, theologically, erroneous, conclusions, in, his, view, the, three, most, serious, of, these, were, believing, in, the, co, eternity, of, the, universe, with, god, denying, the, bodily, resurrection, and, asserting, that, god, only, has, knowledge, of, abstract, universals, not, of, particular, things, though, not, all, philosophers, subscribed, to, these, same, views, in, recent, studies, by, muslim, contemporary, thinkers, that, aim, at, renewing, the, impetus, of, philosophical, thinking, in, islam, the, philosopher, and, theorist, nader, el, bizri, offers, a, critical, analysis, of, the, conventions, that, dominate, mainstream, academic, and, epistemic, approaches, in, studying, islamic, philosophy, these, approaches, of, methodology, and, historiography, are, looked, at, from, archival, standpoints, within, oriental, and, mediaevalist, studies, fail, to, recognize, the, fact, that, philosophy, in, islam, can, still, be, a, living, intellectual, tradition, he, maintains, that, its, renewal, requires, a, radical, reform, in, ontology, and, epistemology, within, islamic, thought, el, bizri, s, interpretations, of, avicenna, ibn, sina, from, the, standpoint, of, heidegger, s, critique, of, the, history, of, metaphysics, and, specifically, against, the, background, of, the, unfolding, of, the, essence, of, technology, aim, at, finding, new, pathways, in, ontology, that, are, not, simply, avicennian, nor, heideggerian, even, though, el, bizri, s, approach, in, rethinking, falsafa, amounts, to, a, neo, avicennism, that, carries, resonances, with, novel, modern, philosophical, ways, of, reading, aristotelianism, and, thomism, el, bizri, engages, contemporary, issues, in, philosophy, through, a, fundamental, critical, analytic, of, the, evolution, of, key, concepts, in, the, history, of, ontology, and, epistemology, nader, el, bizri, is, a, modernist, in, outlook, since, he, aims, at, bringing, newness, to, the, tradition, rather, than, simply, reproduce, it, or, being, in, rupture, with, it, maani, hammad, al, juhani, a, member, of, the, consultative, council, and, general, director, world, assembly, of, muslim, youth, is, quoted, as, declaring, that, because, philosophy, does, not, follow, the, moral, guidelines, of, the, sunnah, philosophy, as, defined, by, the, philosophers, is, one, of, the, most, dangerous, falsehoods, and, most, vicious, in, fighting, faith, and, religion, on, the, basis, of, logic, which, it, is, very, easy, to, use, to, confuse, people, in, the, name, of, reason, interpretation, and, metaphor, that, distort, the, religious, texts
