christianity, protestantism, methodism, also, called, the, methodist, movement, is, a, protestant, christian, tradition, whose, origins, doctrine, and, practice, derive, from, the, life, and, teachings, of, john, wesley, george, whitefield, and, john, s, brother, charles, wesley, were, also, significant, early, leaders, in, the, movement, they, were, named, methodists, for, the, methodical, way, in, which, they, carried, out, their, christian, faith, methodism, originated, as, a, revival, movement, within, anglicanism, with, roots, in, the, church, of, england, in, the, 18th, century, and, became, a, separate, denomination, after, wesley, s, death, the, movement, spread, throughout, the, british, empire, the, united, states, and, beyond, because, of, vigorous, missionary, work, and, today, has, about, 80, million, adherents, worldwide, wesleyan, theology, which, is, upheld, by, the, methodist, denominations, focuses, on, sanctification, and, the, transforming, effect, of, faith, on, the, character, of, a, christian, distinguishing, doctrines, include, the, new, birth, assurance, imparted, righteousness, and, obedience, to, god, manifested, in, performing, works, of, piety, john, wesley, held, that, entire, sanctification, was, the, grand, depositum, or, foundational, doctrine, of, the, methodist, faith, and, its, propagation, was, the, reason, god, brought, methodists, into, existence, scripture, is, considered, the, primary, authority, but, methodists, also, look, to, christian, tradition, including, the, historic, creeds, most, methodists, teach, that, jesus, christ, the, son, of, god, died, for, all, of, humanity, and, that, salvation, is, achievable, for, all, this, is, the, arminian, doctrine, as, opposed, to, the, calvinist, reformed, position, that, god, has, pre, ordained, the, salvation, of, a, select, group, of, people, however, whitefield, and, several, other, early, leaders, of, the, movement, were, considered, calvinistic, methodists, and, held, to, the, calvinist, position, the, movement, has, a, wide, variety, of, forms, of, worship, ranging, from, high, church, to, low, church, in, liturgical, usage, in, addition, to, tent, revivals, and, camp, meetings, held, at, certain, times, of, the, year, denominations, that, descend, from, the, british, methodist, tradition, are, generally, less, ritualistic, while, worship, in, american, methodism, varies, depending, on, the, methodist, denomination, and, congregation, methodist, worship, distinctiveness, includes, the, observance, of, the, quarterly, lovefeast, the, watchnight, service, on, new, year, s, eve, as, well, as, altar, calls, in, which, people, are, invited, to, experience, the, new, birth, and, entire, sanctification, its, emphasis, on, growing, in, grace, after, the, new, birth, and, after, being, entirely, sanctified, led, to, the, creation, of, class, meetings, for, encouragement, in, the, christian, life, methodism, is, known, for, its, rich, musical, tradition, and, charles, wesley, was, instrumental, in, writing, much, of, the, hymnody, of, methodism, in, addition, to, evangelism, methodism, is, known, for, its, charity, as, well, as, support, for, the, sick, the, poor, and, the, afflicted, through, works, of, mercy, that, flow, from, the, love, of, god, and, neighbor, evidenced, in, the, entirely, sanctified, believer, these, ideals, the, social, gospel, are, put, into, practice, by, the, establishment, of, hospitals, orphanages, soup, kitchens, and, schools, to, follow, christ, s, command, to, spread, the, gospel, and, serve, all, people, methodists, are, historically, known, for, their, adherence, to, the, doctrine, of, nonconformity, to, the, world, reflected, by, their, traditional, standards, of, a, commitment, to, sobriety, prohibition, of, gambling, regular, attendance, at, class, meetings, and, weekly, observance, of, the, friday, fast, early, methodists, were, drawn, from, all, levels, of, society, including, the, aristocracy, but, the, methodist, preachers, took, the, message, to, labourers, and, criminals, who, tended, to, be, left, outside, organized, religion, at, that, time, in, britain, the, methodist, church, had, a, major, effect, in, the, early, decades, of, the, developing, working, class, 1760, 1820, in, the, united, states, it, became, the, religion, of, many, slaves, who, later, formed, black, churches, in, the, methodist, tradition, the, methodist, revival, began, in, england, with, a, group, of, men, including, john, wesley, 1703, 1791, and, his, younger, brother, charles, 1707, 1788, as, a, movement, within, the, church, of, england, in, the, 18th, century, the, wesley, brothers, founded, the, holy, club, at, the, university, of, oxford, where, john, was, a, fellow, and, later, a, lecturer, at, lincoln, college, the, club, met, weekly, and, they, systematically, set, about, living, a, holy, life, they, were, accustomed, to, receiving, communion, every, week, fasting, regularly, abstaining, from, most, forms, of, amusement, and, luxury, and, frequently, visited, the, sick, and, the, poor, as, well, as, prisoners, the, fellowship, were, branded, as, methodist, by, their, fellow, students, because, of, the, way, they, used, rule, and, method, to, go, about, their, religious, affairs, john, who, was, leader, of, the, club, took, the, attempted, mockery, and, turned, it, into, a, title, of, honour, in, 1735, at, the, invitation, of, the, founder, of, the, georgia, colony, general, james, oglethorpe, both, john, and, charles, wesley, set, out, for, america, to, be, ministers, to, the, colonists, and, missionaries, to, the, native, americans, unsuccessful, in, their, work, the, brothers, returned, to, england, conscious, of, their, lack, of, genuine, christian, faith, they, looked, for, help, to, peter, boehler, and, other, members, of, the, moravian, church, at, a, moravian, service, in, aldersgate, on, 24, may, 1738, john, experienced, what, has, come, to, be, called, his, evangelical, conversion, when, he, felt, his, heart, strangely, warmed, he, records, in, his, journal, i, felt, i, did, trust, in, christ, christ, alone, for, salvation, and, an, assurance, was, given, me, that, he, had, taken, away, my, sins, even, mine, and, saved, me, from, the, law, of, sin, and, death, charles, had, reported, a, similar, experience, a, few, days, previously, considering, this, a, pivotal, moment, daniel, l, burnett, writes, the, significance, of, wesley, s, aldersgate, experience, is, monumental, without, it, the, names, of, wesley, and, methodism, would, likely, be, nothing, more, than, obscure, footnotes, in, the, pages, of, church, history, the, wesley, brothers, immediately, began, to, preach, salvation, by, faith, to, individuals, and, groups, in, houses, in, religious, societies, and, in, the, few, churches, which, had, not, closed, their, doors, to, evangelical, preachers, john, wesley, came, under, the, influence, of, the, dutch, theologian, jacobus, arminius, 1560, 1609, arminius, had, rejected, the, calvinist, teaching, that, god, had, pre, ordained, an, elect, number, of, people, to, eternal, bliss, while, others, perished, eternally, conversely, george, whitefield, 1714, 1770, howell, harris, 1714, 1773, and, selina, hastings, countess, of, huntingdon, 1707, 1791, were, notable, for, being, calvinistic, methodists, george, whitefield, returning, from, his, own, mission, in, georgia, joined, the, wesley, brothers, in, what, was, rapidly, to, become, a, national, crusade, whitefield, who, had, been, a, fellow, student, of, the, wesleys, and, prominent, member, of, the, holy, club, at, oxford, became, well, known, for, his, unorthodox, itinerant, ministry, in, which, he, was, dedicated, to, open, air, preaching, reaching, crowds, of, thousands, a, key, step, in, the, development, of, john, wesley, s, ministry, was, like, whitefield, to, preach, in, fields, collieries, and, churchyards, to, those, who, did, not, regularly, attend, parish, church, services, accordingly, many, methodist, converts, were, those, disconnected, from, the, church, of, england, wesley, remained, a, cleric, of, the, established, church, and, insisted, that, methodists, attend, their, local, parish, church, as, well, as, methodist, meetings, because, only, an, ordained, minister, could, perform, the, sacraments, of, baptism, and, holy, communion, faced, with, growing, evangelistic, and, pastoral, responsibilities, wesley, and, whitefield, appointed, lay, preachers, and, leaders, methodist, preachers, focused, particularly, on, evangelising, people, who, had, been, neglected, by, the, established, church, of, england, wesley, and, his, assistant, preachers, organized, the, new, converts, into, methodist, societies, these, societies, were, divided, into, groups, called, classes, intimate, meetings, where, individuals, were, encouraged, to, confess, their, sins, to, one, another, and, to, build, up, each, other, they, also, took, part, in, love, feasts, which, allowed, for, the, sharing, of, testimony, a, key, feature, of, early, methodism, growth, in, numbers, and, increasing, hostility, impressed, upon, the, revival, converts, a, deep, sense, of, their, corporate, identity, three, teachings, that, methodists, saw, as, the, foundation, of, christian, faith, were, wesley, s, organisational, skills, soon, established, him, as, the, primary, leader, of, the, movement, whitefield, was, a, calvinist, whereas, wesley, was, an, outspoken, opponent, of, the, doctrine, of, predestination, wesley, argued, against, calvinist, doctrine, that, christians, could, enjoy, a, second, blessing, entire, sanctification, christian, perfection, in, this, life, loving, god, and, their, neighbours, meekness, and, lowliness, of, heart, and, abstaining, from, all, appearance, of, evil, these, differences, put, strains, on, the, alliance, between, whitefield, and, wesley, with, wesley, becoming, hostile, toward, whitefield, in, what, had, been, previously, close, relations, whitefield, consistently, begged, wesley, not, to, let, theological, differences, sever, their, friendship, and, in, time, their, friendship, was, restored, though, this, was, seen, by, many, of, whitefield, s, followers, to, be, a, doctrinal, compromise, many, clergy, in, the, established, church, feared, that, new, doctrines, promulgated, by, the, methodists, such, as, the, necessity, of, a, new, birth, for, salvation, the, first, work, of, grace, of, justification, by, faith, and, of, the, constant, and, sustained, action, of, the, holy, spirit, upon, the, believer, s, soul, would, produce, ill, effects, upon, weak, minds, theophilus, evans, an, early, critic, of, the, movement, even, wrote, that, it, was, the, natural, tendency, of, their, behaviour, in, voice, and, gesture, and, horrid, expressions, to, make, people, mad, in, one, of, his, prints, william, hogarth, likewise, attacked, methodists, as, enthusiasts, full, of, credulity, superstition, and, fanaticism, other, attacks, against, the, methodists, were, physically, violent, wesley, was, nearly, murdered, by, a, mob, at, wednesbury, in, 1743, the, methodists, responded, vigorously, to, their, critics, and, thrived, despite, the, attacks, against, them, initially, the, methodists, merely, sought, reform, within, the, church, of, england, anglicanism, but, the, movement, gradually, departed, from, that, church, george, whitefield, s, preference, for, extemporaneous, prayer, rather, than, the, fixed, forms, of, prayer, in, the, book, of, common, prayer, in, addition, to, his, insistence, on, the, necessity, of, the, new, birth, set, him, at, odds, with, anglican, clergy, as, methodist, societies, multiplied, and, elements, of, an, ecclesiastical, system, were, one, after, another, adopted, the, breach, between, john, wesley, and, the, church, of, england, gradually, widened, in, 1784, wesley, responded, to, the, shortage, of, priests, in, the, american, colonies, due, to, the, american, revolutionary, war, by, ordaining, preachers, for, america, with, power, to, administer, the, sacraments, wesley, s, actions, precipitated, the, split, between, american, methodists, and, the, church, of, england, which, held, that, only, bishops, could, ordain, people, to, ministry, with, regard, to, the, position, of, methodism, within, christendom, john, wesley, once, noted, that, what, god, had, achieved, in, the, development, of, methodism, was, no, mere, human, endeavor, but, the, work, of, god, as, such, it, would, be, preserved, by, god, so, long, as, history, remained, calling, it, the, grand, depositum, of, the, methodist, faith, wesley, specifically, taught, that, the, propagation, of, the, doctrine, of, entire, sanctification, was, the, reason, that, god, raised, up, the, methodists, in, the, world, in, light, of, this, methodists, traditionally, promote, the, motto, holiness, unto, the, lord, the, influence, of, whitefield, and, lady, huntingdon, on, the, church, of, england, was, a, factor, in, the, founding, of, the, free, church, of, england, in, 1844, at, the, time, of, wesley, s, death, there, were, over, 500, methodist, preachers, in, british, colonies, and, the, united, states, total, membership, of, the, methodist, societies, in, britain, was, recorded, as, 56, 000, in, 1791, rising, to, 360, 000, in, 1836, and, 1, 463, 000, by, the, national, census, of, 1851, early, methodism, experienced, a, radical, and, spiritual, phase, that, allowed, women, authority, in, church, leadership, the, role, of, the, woman, preacher, emerged, from, the, sense, that, the, home, should, be, a, place, of, community, care, and, should, foster, personal, growth, methodist, women, formed, a, community, that, cared, for, the, vulnerable, extending, the, role, of, mothering, beyond, physical, care, women, were, encouraged, to, testify, their, faith, however, the, centrality, of, women, s, role, sharply, diminished, after, 1790, as, methodist, churches, became, more, structured, and, more, male, dominated, the, wesleyan, education, committee, which, existed, from, 1838, to, 1902, has, documented, the, methodist, church, s, involvement, in, the, education, of, children, at, first, most, effort, was, placed, in, creating, sunday, schools, but, in, 1836, the, british, methodist, conference, gave, its, blessing, to, the, creation, of, weekday, schools, methodism, spread, throughout, the, british, empire, and, mostly, through, whitefield, s, preaching, during, what, historians, call, the, first, great, awakening, in, colonial, america, after, whitefield, s, death, in, 1770, however, american, methodism, entered, a, more, lasting, wesleyan, and, arminian, phase, of, development, revival, services, and, camp, meetings, were, used, for, spreading, the, methodist, message, with, francis, asbury, stating, that, they, were, our, harvest, seasons, henry, boehm, reported, that, at, a, camp, meeting, in, dover, in, 1805, 1100, persons, received, the, new, birth, and, 600, believers, were, entirely, sanctified, around, the, time, of, john, swanel, inskip, s, leadership, of, the, national, camp, meeting, association, for, the, promotion, of, christian, holiness, in, the, mid, to, latter, 1800s, 80, percent, of, the, membership, of, the, north, georgia, conference, of, the, methodist, episcopal, church, south, professed, being, entirely, sanctified, all, need, to, be, saved, all, may, be, saved, all, may, know, themselves, saved, all, may, be, saved, to, the, uttermost, catechism, for, the, use, of, the, people, called, methodists, 40, many, methodist, bodies, such, as, the, african, methodist, episcopal, church, and, the, united, methodist, church, base, their, doctrinal, standards, on, the, articles, of, religion, john, wesley, s, abridgment, of, the, thirty, nine, articles, of, the, church, of, england, that, excised, its, calvinist, features, some, methodist, denominations, also, publish, catechisms, which, concisely, summarise, christian, doctrine, methodists, generally, accept, the, apostles, creed, and, the, nicene, creed, as, declarations, of, shared, christian, faith, 30, 33, methodism, also, affirms, the, traditional, christian, belief, in, the, triune, godhead, father, son, and, holy, spirit, as, well, as, the, orthodox, understanding, of, the, person, of, jesus, christ, as, god, incarnate, who, is, both, fully, divine, and, fully, human, methodism, emphasizes, doctrines, that, indicate, the, power, of, the, holy, spirit, to, strengthen, the, faith, of, believers, and, to, transform, their, personal, lives, methodism, is, broadly, evangelical, in, doctrine, and, is, characterized, by, wesleyan, theology, john, wesley, is, studied, by, methodists, for, his, interpretation, of, church, practice, and, doctrine, 38, at, its, heart, the, theology, of, john, wesley, stressed, the, life, of, christian, holiness, to, love, god, with, all, one, s, heart, mind, soul, and, strength, and, to, love, one, s, neighbour, as, oneself, one, popular, expression, of, methodist, doctrine, is, in, the, hymns, of, charles, wesley, since, enthusiastic, congregational, singing, was, a, part, of, the, early, evangelical, movement, wesleyan, theology, took, root, and, spread, through, this, channel, martin, v, clarke, who, documented, the, history, of, methodist, hymnody, states, theologically, and, doctrinally, the, content, of, the, hymns, has, traditionally, been, a, primary, vehicle, for, expressing, methodism, s, emphasis, on, salvation, for, all, social, holiness, and, personal, commitment, while, particular, hymns, and, the, communal, act, of, participating, in, hymn, singing, have, been, key, elements, in, the, spiritual, lives, of, methodists, wesleyan, methodists, identify, with, the, arminian, conception, of, free, will, as, opposed, to, the, theological, determinism, of, absolute, predestination, methodism, teaches, that, salvation, is, initiated, when, one, chooses, to, respond, to, god, who, draws, the, individual, near, to, him, the, wesleyan, doctrine, of, prevenient, grace, thus, teaching, synergism, methodists, interpret, scripture, as, teaching, that, the, saving, work, of, jesus, christ, is, for, all, people, unlimited, atonement, but, effective, only, to, those, who, respond, and, believe, in, accordance, with, the, reformation, principles, of, sola, gratia, grace, alone, and, sola, fide, faith, alone, john, wesley, taught, four, key, points, fundamental, to, methodism, after, the, first, work, of, grace, the, new, birth, methodist, soteriology, emphasizes, the, importance, of, the, pursuit, of, holiness, in, salvation, a, concept, best, summarized, in, a, quote, by, methodist, evangelist, phoebe, palmer, who, stated, that, justification, would, have, ended, with, me, had, i, refused, to, be, holy, thus, for, methodists, true, faith, cannot, subsist, without, works, methodism, inclusive, of, the, holiness, movement, thus, teaches, that, justification, conditional, on, obedience, and, progress, in, sanctification, emphasizing, a, deep, reliance, upon, christ, not, only, in, coming, to, faith, but, in, remaining, in, the, faith, john, wesley, taught, that, the, keeping, of, the, moral, law, contained, in, the, ten, commandments, as, well, as, engaging, in, the, works, of, piety, and, the, works, of, mercy, were, indispensable, for, our, sanctification, in, its, categorization, of, sin, methodist, doctrine, distinguishes, between, 1, sin, properly, so, called, and, 2, involuntary, transgression, of, a, divine, law, known, or, unknown, the, former, category, includes, voluntary, transgression, against, god, while, the, second, category, includes, infirmities, such, as, immaturity, ignorance, physical, handicaps, forgetfulness, lack, of, discernment, and, poor, communication, skills, wesley, explains, that, those, born, of, god, do, not, sin, habitually, since, to, do, so, means, that, sin, still, reigns, which, is, a, mark, of, an, unbeliever, neither, does, the, christian, sin, willfully, since, the, believer, s, will, is, now, set, on, living, for, christ, he, further, claims, that, believers, do, not, sin, by, desire, because, the, heart, has, been, thoroughly, transformed, to, desire, only, god, s, perfect, will, wesley, then, addresses, sin, by, infirmities, since, infirmities, involve, no, concurrence, of, the, will, such, deviations, whether, in, thought, word, or, deed, are, not, properly, sin, he, therefore, concludes, that, those, born, of, god, do, not, commit, sin, having, been, saved, from, all, their, sins, ii, 2, 7, this, is, reflected, in, the, articles, of, religion, of, the, free, methodist, church, emphasis, added, in, italics, which, uses, the, wording, of, john, wesley, justified, persons, while, they, do, not, outwardly, commit, sin, are, nevertheless, conscious, of, sin, still, remaining, in, the, heart, they, feel, a, natural, tendency, to, evil, a, proneness, to, depart, from, god, and, cleave, to, the, things, of, earth, those, that, are, sanctified, wholly, are, saved, from, all, inward, sin, from, evil, thoughts, and, evil, tempers, no, wrong, temper, none, contrary, to, love, remains, in, the, soul, all, their, thoughts, words, and, actions, are, governed, by, pure, love, entire, sanctification, takes, place, subsequently, to, justification, and, is, the, work, of, god, wrought, instantaneously, upon, the, consecrated, believing, soul, after, a, soul, is, cleansed, from, all, sin, it, is, then, fully, prepared, to, grow, in, grace, discipline, articles, of, religion, ch, i, 1, p, 23, methodists, also, believe, in, the, second, work, of, grace, christian, perfection, also, known, as, entire, sanctification, which, removes, original, sin, makes, the, believer, holy, and, empowers, him, her, with, power, to, wholly, serve, god, john, wesley, explained, entire, sanctification, or, christian, perfection, is, neither, more, nor, less, than, pure, love, love, expelling, sin, and, governing, both, the, heart, and, life, of, a, child, of, god, the, refiner, s, fire, purges, out, all, that, is, contrary, to, love, methodist, churches, teach, that, apostasy, can, occur, through, a, loss, of, faith, or, through, sinning, if, a, person, backslides, but, later, decides, to, return, to, god, he, or, she, must, confess, his, or, her, sins, and, be, entirely, sanctified, again, the, arminian, doctrine, of, conditional, security, methodists, hold, that, sacraments, are, sacred, acts, of, divine, institution, methodism, has, inherited, its, liturgy, from, anglicanism, although, wesleyan, theology, tends, to, have, a, stronger, sacramental, emphasis, than, that, held, by, evangelical, anglicans, in, common, with, most, protestants, methodists, recognize, two, sacraments, as, being, instituted, by, christ, baptism, and, holy, communion, also, called, the, lord, s, supper, most, methodist, churches, practice, infant, baptism, in, anticipation, of, a, response, to, be, made, later, confirmation, as, well, as, baptism, of, believing, adults, the, catechism, for, the, use, of, the, people, called, methodists, states, that, jesus, christ, is, present, with, his, worshipping, people, and, gives, himself, to, them, as, their, lord, and, saviour, 26, in, the, united, methodist, church, the, explanation, of, how, christ, s, presence, is, made, manifest, in, the, elements, bread, and, wine, is, described, as, a, holy, mystery, methodist, churches, generally, recognize, sacraments, to, be, a, means, of, grace, john, wesley, held, that, god, also, imparted, grace, by, other, established, means, such, as, public, and, private, prayer, scripture, reading, study, and, preaching, public, worship, and, fasting, these, constitute, the, works, of, piety, wesley, considered, means, of, grace, to, be, outward, signs, words, or, actions, to, be, the, ordinary, channels, whereby, might, convey, to, men, preventing, justifying, or, sanctifying, grace, specifically, methodist, means, such, as, the, class, meetings, provided, his, chief, examples, for, these, prudential, means, of, grace, american, methodist, theologian, albert, outler, in, assessing, john, wesley, s, own, practices, of, theological, reflection, proposes, a, methodology, termed, the, wesleyan, quadrilateral, wesley, s, quadrilateral, is, referred, to, in, methodism, as, our, theological, guidelines, and, is, taught, to, its, ministers, clergy, in, seminary, as, the, primary, approach, to, interpreting, scripture, and, gaining, guidance, for, moral, questions, and, dilemmas, faced, in, daily, living, 76, 88, traditionally, methodists, declare, the, bible, old, and, new, testaments, to, be, the, only, divinely, inspired, scripture, and, the, primary, source, of, authority, for, christians, the, historic, methodist, understanding, of, scripture, is, based, on, the, superstructure, of, wesleyan, covenant, theology, methodists, also, make, use, of, tradition, drawing, primarily, from, the, teachings, of, the, church, fathers, as, a, secondary, source, of, authority, tradition, may, serve, as, a, lens, through, which, scripture, is, interpreted, theological, discourse, for, methodists, almost, always, makes, use, of, scripture, read, inside, the, wider, theological, tradition, of, christianity, john, wesley, contended, that, a, part, of, the, theological, method, would, involve, experiential, faith, in, other, words, truth, would, be, vivified, in, personal, experience, of, christians, overall, not, individually, if, it, were, really, truth, and, every, doctrine, must, be, able, to, be, defended, rationally, he, did, not, divorce, faith, from, reason, by, reason, one, asks, questions, of, faith, and, seeks, to, understand, god, s, action, and, will, tradition, experience, and, reason, however, were, subject, always, to, scripture, wesley, argued, because, only, there, is, the, word, of, god, revealed, so, far, as, it, is, necessary, for, our, salvation, 77, early, methodism, was, known, for, its, almost, monastic, rigors, its, living, by, rule, its, canonical, hours, of, prayer, it, inherited, from, its, anglican, patrimony, the, practice, of, reciting, the, daily, office, which, methodist, christians, were, expected, to, pray, the, first, prayer, book, of, methodism, the, sunday, service, of, the, methodists, with, other, occasional, services, thus, included, the, canonical, hours, of, both, morning, prayer, and, evening, prayer, these, services, were, observed, everyday, in, early, christianity, though, on, the, lord, s, day, worship, included, the, eucharist, later, methodist, liturgical, books, such, as, the, methodist, worship, book, 1999, provide, for, morning, prayer, and, evening, prayer, to, be, prayed, daily, the, united, methodist, church, encourages, its, communicants, to, pray, the, canonical, hours, as, one, of, the, essential, practices, of, being, a, disciple, of, jesus, some, methodist, religious, orders, publish, the, daily, office, to, be, used, for, that, community, for, example, the, book, of, offices, and, services, of, the, order, of, saint, luke, contains, the, canonical, hours, to, be, prayed, traditionally, at, seven, fixed, prayer, times, lauds, 6, am, terce, 9, am, sext, 12, pm, none, 3, pm, vespers, 6, pm, compline, 9, pm, and, vigil, 12, am, some, methodist, congregations, offer, daily, morning, prayer, with, respect, to, public, worship, methodism, was, endowed, by, the, wesley, brothers, with, worship, characterised, by, a, twofold, practice, the, ritual, liturgy, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, on, the, one, hand, and, the, non, ritualistic, preaching, service, on, the, other, this, twofold, practice, became, distinctive, of, methodism, because, worship, in, the, church, of, england, was, based, by, law, solely, on, the, book, of, common, prayer, and, worship, in, the, nonconformist, churches, was, almost, exclusively, that, of, services, of, the, word, i, e, preaching, services, with, holy, communion, being, observed, infrequently, john, wesley, s, influence, meant, that, in, methodism, the, two, practices, were, combined, a, situation, which, remains, characteristic, of, the, tradition, methodism, has, heavily, emphasized, offerings, of, extempore, and, spontaneous, prayer, historically, methodist, churches, have, devoutly, observed, the, lord, s, day, sunday, with, a, morning, service, of, worship, along, with, an, evening, service, of, worship, with, the, evening, service, being, aimed, at, seekers, and, focusing, on, singing, prayer, and, preaching, the, holding, of, a, midweek, prayer, meeting, on, wednesday, evenings, has, been, customary, 18th, century, methodist, church, services, were, characterized, by, the, following, pattern, preliminaries, e, g, singing, prayers, testimonies, to, a, message, followed, by, an, invitation, to, commitment, the, latter, of, which, took, the, form, altar, call, a, practice, that, a, remains, a, vital, part, of, worship, a, number, of, methodist, congregations, devote, a, portion, of, their, sunday, evening, service, and, mid, week, wednesday, evening, prayer, meeting, to, having, congregants, share, their, prayer, requests, in, addition, to, hearing, personal, testimonies, about, their, faith, and, experiences, in, living, the, christian, life, after, listening, to, various, members, of, the, congregation, voice, their, prayer, requests, congregants, may, kneel, for, intercessory, prayer, the, lovefeast, traditionally, practiced, quarterly, was, another, practice, that, characterized, early, methodism, as, john, wesley, taught, that, it, was, an, apostolic, ordinance, worship, hymnology, devotional, and, liturgical, practices, in, methodism, were, also, influenced, by, lutheran, pietism, and, in, turn, methodist, worship, became, influential, in, the, holiness, movement, in, america, the, united, methodist, church, and, free, methodist, church, as, well, as, the, primitive, methodist, church, and, wesleyan, methodist, church, have, a, wide, variety, of, forms, of, worship, ranging, from, high, church, to, low, church, in, liturgical, usage, when, the, methodists, in, america, were, separated, from, the, church, of, england, because, of, the, american, revolution, john, wesley, provided, a, revised, version, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, called, the, sunday, service, of, the, methodists, with, other, occasional, services, 1784, today, the, primary, liturgical, books, of, the, united, methodist, church, are, the, united, methodist, hymnal, and, the, united, methodist, book, of, worship, 1992, congregations, employ, its, liturgy, and, rituals, as, optional, resources, but, their, use, is, not, mandatory, these, books, contain, the, liturgies, of, the, church, that, are, generally, derived, from, wesley, s, sunday, service, and, from, the, 20th, century, liturgical, renewal, movement, the, british, methodist, church, is, less, ordered, or, less, liturgical, in, worship, it, makes, use, of, the, methodist, worship, book, similar, to, the, church, of, england, s, common, worship, containing, set, services, and, rubrics, for, the, celebration, of, other, rites, such, as, marriage, the, worship, book, is, also, ultimately, derived, from, wesley, s, sunday, service, a, unique, feature, of, american, methodism, has, been, the, observance, of, the, season, of, kingdomtide, encompassing, the, last, 13, weeks, before, advent, thus, dividing, the, long, season, after, pentecost, into, two, segments, during, kingdomtide, methodist, liturgy, has, traditionally, emphasized, charitable, work, and, alleviating, the, suffering, of, the, poor, a, second, distinctive, liturgical, feature, of, methodism, is, the, use, of, covenant, services, although, practice, varies, between, national, churches, most, methodist, churches, annually, follow, the, call, of, john, wesley, for, a, renewal, of, their, covenant, with, god, it, is, common, for, each, congregation, to, use, the, covenant, renewal, liturgy, during, the, watchnight, service, in, the, night, of, new, year, s, eve, though, in, britain, these, are, often, on, the, first, sunday, of, the, year, wesley, s, covenant, prayer, is, still, used, with, minor, modification, in, the, order, of, service, christ, has, many, services, to, be, done, some, are, easy, others, are, difficult, some, bring, honour, others, bring, reproach, some, are, suitable, to, our, natural, inclinations, and, temporal, interests, others, are, contrary, to, both, yet, the, power, to, do, all, these, things, is, given, to, us, in, christ, who, strengthens, us, i, am, no, longer, my, own, but, yours, put, me, to, what, you, will, rank, me, with, whom, you, will, put, me, to, doing, put, me, to, suffering, let, me, be, employed, for, you, or, laid, aside, for, you, exalted, for, you, or, brought, low, for, you, let, me, be, full, let, me, be, empty, let, me, have, all, things, let, me, have, nothing, i, freely, and, wholeheartedly, yield, all, things, to, your, pleasure, and, disposal, 290, as, john, wesley, advocated, outdoor, evangelism, revival, services, are, a, traditional, worship, practice, of, methodism, that, are, often, held, in, churches, as, well, as, at, camp, meetings, brush, arbor, revivals, and, tent, revivals, traditionally, methodist, connexions, descending, from, the, tradition, of, the, methodist, episcopal, church, have, a, probationary, period, of, six, months, before, an, individual, is, admitted, into, church, membership, as, a, full, member, of, a, congregation, given, the, wide, attendance, at, methodist, revival, meetings, many, people, started, to, attend, methodist, services, of, worship, regularly, though, they, had, not, yet, committed, to, membership, when, they, made, that, commitment, becoming, a, probationer, was, the, first, step, and, during, this, period, probationers, receive, additional, instruction, and, provide, evidence, of, the, seriousness, of, their, faith, and, willingness, to, abide, by, church, discipline, before, being, accepted, into, full, membership, in, addition, to, this, to, be, a, probationary, member, of, a, methodist, congregation, a, person, traditionally, requires, an, earnest, desire, to, be, saved, from, sins, in, the, historic, methodist, system, probationers, were, eligible, to, become, members, of, class, meetings, where, they, could, be, further, discipled, in, their, faith, catechisms, such, as, the, probationer, s, handbook, authored, by, minister, stephen, o, garrison, have, been, used, by, probationers, to, learn, the, methodist, faith, after, six, months, probationers, were, examined, before, the, leaders, and, stewards, meeting, which, consisted, of, class, leaders, and, stewards, where, they, were, to, provide, satisfactory, assurance, both, of, the, correctness, of, his, faith, and, of, his, willingness, to, observe, and, keep, the, rules, of, the, church, if, probationers, were, able, to, do, this, they, were, admitted, as, full, members, of, the, congregation, by, the, pastor, full, members, of, a, methodist, congregation, were, obligated, to, attend, worship, services, on, a, regular, basis, and, were, to, abide, by, certain, moral, precepts, especially, as, they, related, to, substance, use, gambling, divorce, and, immoral, pastimes, this, practice, continues, in, certain, methodist, connexions, such, as, the, lumber, river, conference, of, the, holiness, methodist, church, in, which, probationers, must, be, examined, by, the, pastor, class, leader, and, board, for, full, membership, in, addition, to, being, baptized, the, same, structure, is, found, in, the, african, methodist, episcopal, zion, church, which, teaches, in, order, that, we, may, not, admit, improper, persons, into, our, church, great, care, be, taken, in, receiving, persons, on, probation, and, let, not, one, be, so, received, or, enrolled, who, does, not, give, satisfactory, evidence, of, his, her, desire, to, flee, the, wrath, to, come, and, to, be, saved, from, his, her, sins, such, a, person, satisfying, us, in, these, particulars, may, be, received, into, our, church, on, six, months, probation, but, shall, not, be, admitted, to, full, membership, until, he, she, shall, have, given, satisfactory, evidence, of, saving, faith, in, the, lord, jesus, christ, the, pastor, and, class, leader, are, to, ensure, that, all, persons, on, probation, be, instructed, in, the, rules, and, doctrines, of, the, african, methodist, episcopal, zion, church, before, they, are, admitted, to, full, membership, and, that, probationers, are, expected, to, conform, to, the, rules, and, usages, of, the, church, and, to, show, evidence, of, their, desire, for, fellowship, in, the, church, after, the, six, month, probation, period, a, probationer, may, be, admitted, to, full, membership, provided, he, she, has, served, out, his, her, probation, has, been, baptized, recommended, at, the, leaders, meeting, and, if, none, has, been, held, according, to, law, recommended, by, the, leader, and, on, examination, by, the, pastor, before, the, church, as, required, in, 600, has, given, satisfactory, assurance, both, of, the, correctness, of, his, her, faith, and, of, his, her, willingness, to, observe, and, keep, the, rules, of, our, church, the, allegheny, wesleyan, methodist, connection, admits, to, associate, membership, by, vote, of, the, congregation, those, who, give, affirmation, to, two, questions, 1, does, the, lord, now, forgive, your, sins, 2, will, you, acquaint, yourself, with, the, discipline, of, our, connection, and, earnestly, endeavor, to, govern, your, life, by, its, rules, as, god, shall, give, you, understanding, probationers, who, wish, to, become, full, members, are, examined, by, the, advisory, board, before, being, received, as, such, through, four, vows, on, the, new, birth, entire, sanctification, outward, holiness, and, assent, to, the, articles, of, religion, and, a, covenant, in, the, united, methodist, church, the, process, of, becoming, a, professing, member, of, a, congregation, is, done, through, the, taking, membership, vows, normatively, in, the, rite, of, confirmation, after, a, period, of, instruction, and, receiving, the, sacrament, of, baptism, it, is, the, practice, of, certain, methodist, connexions, that, when, people, become, members, of, a, congregation, they, are, offered, the, right, hand, of, fellowship, methodists, traditionally, celebrate, the, covenant, renewal, service, as, the, watchnight, service, annually, on, new, year, s, eve, in, which, members, renew, their, covenant, with, god, and, the, church, early, methodists, wore, plain, dress, with, methodist, clergy, condemning, high, headdresses, ruffles, laces, gold, and, costly, apparel, in, general, john, wesley, recommended, that, methodists, annually, read, his, thoughts, on, dress, in, that, sermon, wesley, expressed, his, desire, for, methodists, let, me, see, before, i, die, a, methodist, congregation, full, as, plain, dressed, as, a, quaker, congregation, the, 1858, discipline, of, the, wesleyan, methodist, connection, thus, stated, that, we, would, enjoin, on, all, who, fear, god, plain, dress, peter, cartwright, a, methodist, revivalist, stated, that, in, addition, to, wearing, plain, dress, the, early, methodists, distinguished, themselves, from, other, members, of, society, by, fasting, once, a, week, abstaining, from, alcohol, teetotalism, and, devoutly, observing, the, sabbath, methodist, circuit, riders, were, known, for, practicing, the, spiritual, discipline, of, mortifying, the, flesh, as, they, arose, well, before, dawn, for, solitary, prayer, they, remained, on, their, knees, without, food, or, drink, or, physical, comforts, sometimes, for, hours, on, end, the, early, methodists, did, not, participate, in, and, condemned, worldly, habits, including, playing, cards, racing, horses, gambling, attending, the, theater, dancing, both, in, frolics, and, balls, and, cockfighting, in, methodism, fasting, is, considered, one, of, the, works, of, piety, the, directions, given, to, band, societies, 25, december, 1744, by, john, wesley, mandate, fasting, and, abstinence, from, meat, on, all, fridays, of, the, year, in, remembrance, of, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, wesley, himself, also, fasted, before, receiving, holy, communion, for, the, purpose, of, focusing, his, attention, on, god, and, asked, other, methodists, to, do, the, same, over, time, many, of, these, practices, were, relaxed, in, mainline, methodism, although, practices, such, as, teetotalism, and, fasting, are, still, encouraged, in, addition, to, the, current, prohibition, of, gambling, denominations, of, the, conservative, holiness, movement, such, as, the, allegheny, wesleyan, methodist, connection, and, evangelical, methodist, church, conference, continue, to, reflect, the, spirit, of, the, historic, methodist, practice, of, wearing, plain, dress, with, members, abstaining, from, the, wearing, of, apparel, which, does, not, modestly, and, properly, clothe, the, person, and, refraining, from, the, wearing, of, jewelry, and, superfluous, ornaments, including, the, wedding, ring, the, fellowship, of, independent, methodist, churches, which, continues, to, observe, the, ordinance, of, women, s, headcovering, stipulates, renouncing, all, vain, pomp, and, glory, and, adorning, oneself, with, modest, attire, the, general, rules, of, the, methodist, church, in, america, which, are, among, the, doctrinal, standards, of, many, methodist, churches, promote, first, day, sabbatarianism, as, they, require, attending, upon, all, the, ordinances, of, god, including, the, public, worship, of, god, and, prohibit, profaning, the, day, of, the, lord, either, by, doing, ordinary, work, therein, or, by, buying, or, selling, methodism, is, a, worldwide, movement, and, methodist, churches, are, present, on, all, populated, continents, although, methodism, is, declining, in, great, britain, and, north, america, it, is, growing, in, other, places, at, a, rapid, pace, in, for, example, south, korea, there, is, no, single, methodist, church, with, universal, juridical, authority, methodists, belong, to, multiple, independent, denominations, or, connexions, the, great, majority, of, methodists, are, members, of, denominations, which, are, part, of, the, world, methodist, council, an, international, association, of, 80,

and, independent, revivals, led, to, the, formation, of, a, number, of, separate, denominations, calling, themselves, methodist, the, largest, of, these, were, the, primitive, methodists, deriving, from, a, revival, at, mow, cop, in, staffordshire, the, bible, christians, and, the, methodist, new, connexion, the, original, church, adopted, the, name, wesleyan, methodist, to, distinguish, it, from, these, bodies, in, 1907, a, union, of, smaller, groups, with, the, methodist, new, connexion, and, bible, christian, church, brought, about, the, united, methodist, church, then, the, three,

from, these, temperance, appealed, strongly, to, the, methodist, doctrines, of, sanctification, and, perfection, to, this, day, alcohol, remains, banned, in, methodist, premises, however, this,

significant, amount, dissented, from, this, decision, resulting, in, the, independence, of, the, allegheny, wesleyan, methodist, connection, and, the, formation, of, the, bible, methodist, connection, of, churches, both, of, which, fall, within, the, conservative, holiness, movement, in, a, much, larger, split, in, 1845, at, louisville, kentucky, the, churches, of, the, slaveholding, states, left, the, methodist, episcopal, church, and, formed, the, methodist, episcopal, church, south, the, northern, and, southern, branches, were, reunited, in, 1939, when, slavery, was, no, longer, an, issue,

methodists, were, often, involved, in, the, missionary, awakening, and, the, social, gospel, movement, the, awakening, in, so, many, cities, in, 1858, started, the, movement, but, in, the, north, it, was, interrupted, by, the, civil, war, in, the, south, on, the, other, hand, the, civil, war, stimulated, revivals, especially, in, lee, s, army, in, 1914, 1917, many, methodist, ministers, made,

of, ministers, showing, 56, opposed, warfare, however, the, methodist, federation, called, for, a, boycott, of, japan, which, had, invaded, china, and, was, disrupting, missionary, activity, there,

from, mergers, of, several, groups, of, german, methodist, heritage, however, there, was, no, longer, any, need, or, desire, to, worship, in, the, german, language, the, latter, church, was, a,
