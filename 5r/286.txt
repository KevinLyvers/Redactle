earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, what, appears, to, be, an, upper, paleolithic, shrine, for, shakti, worship, were, discovered, in, the, terminal, upper, paleolithic, site, of, baghor, i, baghor, stone, in, sidhi, district, of, madhya, pradesh, india, the, excavations, carried, out, under, the, guidance, of, noted, archaeologists, g, r, sharma, of, allahabad, university, and, j,

dwelling, in, everything, the, vedic, literature, reveres, various, goddesses, but, far, less, frequently, than, gods, indra, agni, and, soma, yet, they, are, declared, equivalent, aspects, of, the, neutral, brahman, of, prajapati, and, purusha, the, goddesses, often, mentioned, in, the, vedic, layers, of, text, include, the, ushas, dawn, v, c, speech, wisdom, sarasvati, as, river, prithivi, earth, nirriti, annihilator, shraddha, faith, confidence, goddesses, such, as, uma, appear, in, the, upanishads, as, another, aspect, of, divine, and, the, knower, of, ultimate, knowledge, brahman, such, as, in, section, 3, and, 4, of, the, ancient, kena, upanishad, hymns, to, goddesses, are, in, the, ancient, hindu, epic, mahabharata, particularly, in, the, harivamsa, section, which, was, a, late, addition, 100, to, 300, ce, to, the, work, the, archaeological, and, textual, evidence, implies, states, thomas, coburn, that, the, goddess, had, become, as, prominent, as, god, in, hindu, tradition, by, about, the, third, or, fourth, century, the, literature, on, shakti, theology, grew, in, ancient, india, climaxing, in, one, of, the, most, important, texts, of, shaktism, called, the, devi, mahatmya, this, text, states, c, mackenzie, brown, a, professor, of, religion, is, both, a, culmination, of, centuries, of, indian, ideas, about, the, divine, woman, as, well, as, a, foundation, for, the, literature, and, spirituality, focussed, on, the, female, transcendence, in, centuries, that, followed, the, devi, mahatmya, is, considered, in, shaktism, to, be, as, important, as, the, bhagavad, gita, the, devi, mahatmya, is, not, the, earliest, literary, fragment, attesting, to, the, existence, of, devotion, to, a, goddess, figure, states, thomas, b, coburn, a, professor, of, religious, studies, but, it, is, surely, the, earliest, in, which, the, object, of, worship, is, conceptualized, as, goddess, with, a, capital, g, the, central, conception, of, hindu, philosophy, is, of, the, absolute, that, is, the, background, of, the, universe, this, absolute, being, of, whom, we, can, predicate, nothing, has, its, powers, spoken, of, as, she, that, is, the, real, personal, god, in, india, is, she, swami, vivekananda, shaktas, conceive, the, goddess, as, the, supreme, ultimate, eternal, reality, of, all, existence, or, same, as, the, brahman, concept, of, hinduism, she, is, considered, to, be, simultaneously, the, source, of, all, creation, its, embodiment, and, the, energy, that, animates, and, governs, it, and, that, into, which, everything, will, ultimately, dissolve, mahadevi, said, in, devi, upanishad, verse, 2, i, am, essentially, brahman, according, to, v, r, ramachandra, dikshitar, a, professor, of, indian, history, in, shaktism, theology, brahman, is, static, shakti, and, shakti, is, dynamic, brahman, shaktism, views, the, devi, as, the, source, essence, and, substance, of, everything, in, creation, its, texts, such, as, the, devi, bhagavata, purana, states, i, am, manifest, divinity, unmanifest, divinity, and, transcendent, divinity, i, am, brahma, vishnu, and, shiva, as, well, as, saraswati, lakshmi, and, parvati, i, am, the, sun, and, i, am, the, stars, and, i, am, also, the, moon, i, am, all, animals, and, birds, and, i, am, the, outcaste, as, well, and, the, thief, i, am, the, low, person, of, dreadful, deeds, and, the, great, person, of, excellent, deeds, i, am, female, i, am, male, in, the, form, of, shiva, shaktism, s, focus, on, the, divine, female, does, not, imply, a, rejection, of, the, male, it, rejects, masculine, feminine, male, female, soul, body, transcendent, immanent, dualism, considering, nature, as, divine, devi, is, considered, to, be, the, cosmos, itself, she, is, the, embodiment, of, energy, matter, and, soul, the, motivating, force, behind, all, action, and, existence, in, the, material, universe, yet, in, shaktism, states, c, mackenzie, brown, the, cultural, concepts, of, masculine, and, the, feminine, as, they, exist, among, practitioners, of, shaktism, are, aspects, of, the, divine, transcendent, reality, in, hindu, iconography, the, cosmic, dynamic, of, male, female, or, masculine, feminine, interdependence, and, equivalence, is, expressed, in, the, half, shakti, half, shiva, deity, known, as, ardhanari, the, philosophical, premise, in, many, shakta, texts, states, professor, of, religious, studies, june, mcdaniel, is, syncretism, of, samkhya, and, advaita, vedanta, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, called, shaktadavaitavada, literally, the, path, of, nondualistic, shakti, the, hindu, monk, swami, vivekananda, remarked, thus, about, being, an, actual, shakti, worshipper, do, you, know, who, is, the, real, shakti, worshipper, it, is, he, who, knows, that, god, is, the, omnipresent, force, in, the, universe, and, sees, in, women, the, manifestation, of, that, force, shakta, universalist, sri, ramakrishna, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, of, the, hindu, reform, movements, believed, that, all, hindu, goddesses, are, manifestations, of, the, same, mother, goddess, the, 18th, century, shakta, bhakti, poems, and, songs, were, composed, by, two, bengal, court, poets, bharatchandra, ray, and, ramprasad, sen, and, the, tamil, collection, abhirami, anthadhi, was, composed, by, abhirami, bhattar, the, important, scriptures, of, shaktism, include, the, shakta, upanishads, as, well, as, shakta, oriented, upa, puranic, literature, such, as, the, devi, purana, and, kalika, purana, the, lalita, sahasranama, from, the, brahmanda, purana, the, tripura, upanishad, is, historically, the, most, complete, introduction, to, shakta, tantrism, distilling, into, its, 16, verses, almost, every, important, topic, in, shakta, tantra, tradition, along, with, the, tripura, upanishad, the, tripuratapini, upanishad, has, attracted, scholarly, bhasya, commentary, in, the, second, half, of, 2nd, millennium, such, as, the, work, of, bhaskararaya, and, ramanand, these, texts, link, the, shakti, tantra, tradition, as, a, vedic, attribute, however, this, link, has, been, contested, by, scholars, scriptures, such, as, the, devi, mahatmya, devi, bhagavata, purana, kalika, purana, and, shakta, upanishads, like, the, devi, upanishad, are, particularly, revered, the, seventh, book, of, the, srimad, devi, bhagavatam, presents, the, theology, of, shaktism, this, book, is, called, devi, gita, or, the, song, of, the, goddess, the, goddess, explains, she, is, the, brahman, that, created, the, world, asserting, the, advaita, premise, that, spiritual, liberation, occurs, when, one, fully, comprehends, the, identity, of, one, s, soul, and, the, brahman, this, knowledge, asserts, the, goddess, comes, from, detaching, self, from, the, world, and, meditating, on, one, s, own, soul, the, devi, gita, like, the, bhagavad, gita, is, a, condensed, philosophical, treatise, it, presents, the, divine, female, as, a, powerful, and, compassionate, creator, pervader, and, protector, of, the, universe, she, is, presented, in, the, opening, chapter, of, the, devi, gita, as, the, benign, and, beautiful, world, mother, called, bhuvaneshvari, literally, ruler, of, the, universe, thereafter, the, text, presents, its, theological, and, philosophical, teachings, the, soul, and, the, goddess, my, sacred, syllable, transcends, the, distinction, of, name, and, named, beyond, all, dualities, it, is, whole, infinite, being, consciousness, and, bliss, one, should, meditate, on, that, reality, within, the, flaming, light, of, consciousness, fixing, the, mind, upon, me, as, the, goddess, transcending, all, space, and, time, one, quickly, merges, with, me, by, realizing, the, oneness, of, the, soul, and, brahman, devi, gita, transl, lynn, foulston, stuart, abbott, devibhagavata, purana, book, 7, the, devi, gita, describes, the, devi, or, goddess, as, universal, cosmic, energy, resident, within, each, individual, it, thus, weaves, in, the, terminology, of, samkhya, school, of, hindu, philosophy, the, text, is, suffused, with, advaita, vedanta, ideas, wherein, nonduality, is, emphasized, all, dualities, are, declared, as, incorrect, and, interconnected, oneness, of, all, living, beings, souls, with, brahman, is, held, as, the, liberating, knowledge, however, adds, tracy, pintchman, a, professor, of, religious, studies, and, hinduism, devi, gita, incorporates, tantric, ideas, giving, the, devi, a, form, and, motherly, character, rather, than, the, gender, neutral, concept, of, adi, shankara, s, advaita, vedanta, shaktism, is, a, goddess, centric, tradition, of, hinduism, involving, many, goddesses, all, being, regarded, as, various, aspects, manifestations, or, personifications, of, the, same, supreme, goddess, shakti, shaktas, approach, the, devi, in, many, forms, however, they, are, all, considered, to, be, but, diverse, aspects, of, the, one, supreme, goddess, the, primary, devi, form, worshiped, by, a, shakta, devotee, is, his, or, her, ishta, devi, that, is, a, personally, selected, devi, the, selection, of, this, deity, can, depend, on, many, factors, such, as, family, tradition, regional, practice, guru, lineage, and, personal, resonance, some, forms, of, the, goddess, are, widely, known, in, the, hindu, world, the, common, goddesses, of, shaktism, popular, in, the, hindu, thought, at, least, by, about, mid, 1st, millennium, ce, include, parvati, durga, kali, yogamaya, lakshmi, saraswati, gayatri, radha, and, sita, in, the, eastern, part, of, india, after, the, decline, of, buddhism, in, india, various, hindu, and, buddhist, goddesses, were, combined, to, form, the, mahavidya, a, pantheon, of, ten, goddesses, the, rarer, forms, of, devi, found, among, tantric, shakta, are, the, mahavidyas, particularly, tripura, sundari, bhuvaneshvari, tara, bhairavi, chhinnamasta, dhumavati, bagalamukhi, matangi, and, kamala, other, major, goddess, groups, include, the, sapta, matrika,

supplement, various, written, sources, there, has, been, a, historic, debate, between, shakta, theologians, on, whether, its, tantric, practices, are, vedic, or, non, vedic, the, roots, of, shakta, tantrism, are, unclear, probably, ancient, and, independent, of, the, vedic, tradition, of, hinduism, the, interaction, between, vedic, and, tantric, traditions, trace, back, to, at, least, the, sixth, century, and, the, surge, in, tantra, tradition, developments, during, the, late, medieval, period, states, geoffrey, samuel, were, a, means, to, confront, and, cope, with, islamic, invasions,

the, highest, order, that, seek, to, access, the, shakti, divine, energy, or, power, that, is, believed, to, be, the, devi, s, nature, and, form, its, two, largest, and, most, visible, schools, are, the, srikula, family, of, tripura, sundari, strongest, in, south, india, and, the, kalikula, family, of, kali, which, prevails, in, northern, and, eastern, india, the, srikula, family, of, sri, tradition, sampradaya, focuses, worship, on, devi, in, the, form, of, the, goddess, lalita, tripura, sundari, rooted, in, first, millennium, srikula, became, a, force, in, south, india, no, later, than, the, seventh, century, and, is, today, the, prevalent, form, of, shaktism, practiced, in, south, indian, regions, such, as, kerala, tamil, nadu, and, tamil, areas, of, sri, lanka, the, srikula, s, best, known, school, is, srividya, one, of, shakta, tantrism, s, most, influential, and, theologically, sophisticated, movements, its, central, symbol, the, sri, chakra, is, probably, the, most, famous, visual, image, in, all, of, hindu, tantric, tradition, its, literature, and, practice, is, perhaps, more, systematic, than, that, of, any, other, shakta, sect, srividya, largely, views, the, goddess, as, benign, and, beautiful, in, contrast, to, kalikula, s, focus, on, terrifying, and, horrifying, goddess, forms, such, as, kali, or, durga, in, srikula, practice, moreover, every, aspect, of, the, goddess, whether, malignant, or, gentle, is, identified, with, lalita, srikula, adepts, most, often, worship, lalita, using, the, abstract, sri, chakra, yantra, which, is, regarded, as, her, subtle, form, the, sri, chakra, can, be, visually, rendered, either, as, a, two, dimensional, diagram, whether, drawn, temporarily, as, part, of, the, worship, ritual, or, permanently, engraved, in, metal, or, in, the, three, dimensional, pyramidal, form, known, as, the, sri, meru, it, is, not, uncommon, to, find, a, sri, chakra, or, sri, meru, installed, in, south, indian, temples, because, as, modern, practitioners, assert, there, is, no, disputing, that, this, is, the, highest, form, of, devi, and, that, some, of, the, practice, can, be, done, openly, but, what, you, see, in, the, temples, is, not, the, srichakra, worship, you, see, when, it, is, done, privately, the, srividya, paramparas, can, be, further, broadly, subdivided, into, two, streams, the, kaula, a, vamamarga, practice, and, the, samaya, a, dakshinamarga, practice, the, kaula, or, kaulachara, first, appeared, as, a, coherent, ritual, system, in, the, 8th, century, in, central, india, and, its, most, revered, theorist, is, the, 18th, century, philosopher, bhaskararaya, widely, considered, the, best, exponent, of, shakta, philosophy, the, samaya, or, samayacharya, finds, its, roots, in, the, work, of, the, 16th, century, commentator, lakshmidhara, and, is, fiercely, puritanical, attempts, to, reform, tantric, practice, in, ways, that, bring, it, in, line, with, high, caste, brahmanical, norms, many, samaya, practitioners, explicitly, deny, being, either, shakta, or, tantric, though, scholars, argues, that, their, cult, remains, technically, both, the, samaya, kaula, division, marks, an, old, dispute, within, hindu, tantrism, the, kalikula, family, of, kali, form, of, shaktism, is, most, dominant, in, northeastern, india, and, is, most, widely, prevalent, in, west, bengal, assam, bihar, and, odisha, as, well, as, nepal, and, kerala, the, goddesses, kubjika, kulesvari, chamunda, chandi, shamshan, kali, goddess, of, the, cremation, ground, dakshina, kali, and, siddheshwari, are, worshipped, in, the, region, of, bengal, to, protect, against, disease, and, smallpox, as, well, as, ill, omens, kalikula, lineages, focus, upon, the, devi, as, the, source, of, wisdom, vidya, and, liberation, moksha, the, tantric, part, generally, stand, in, opposition, to, the, brahmanic, tradition, which, they, view, as, overly, conservative, and, denying, the, experiential, part, of, religion, the, main, deities, of, the, kalikula, tradition, are, kali, chandi, bheema, and, durga, other, goddesses, that, enjoy, veneration, are, tara, and, all, the, other, mahavidyas, kaumari, as, well, as, regional, goddesses, such, as, manasa, the, snake, goddesses, a, the, protectress, of, children, tal, the, smallpox, goddess, and, um, the, bengali, name, for, parvati, all, of, them, again, considered, aspects, of, the, divine, mother, in, nepal, devi, is, mainly, worshipped, as, the, goddess, bhavani, she, is, one, of, the, important, hindu, deities, in, nepal, two, major, centers, of, shaktism, in, west, bengal, are, kalighat, where, the, skull, of, kali, is, believed, to, be, worshipped, along, with, her, 25, forms, the, kali, ghat, temple, is, located, in, calcutta, and, tarapith, in, birbhum, district, in, calcutta, emphasis, is, on, devotion, bhakti, to, the, goddess, as, kali, where, the, goddess, kali, is, seen, as, the, destroyer, of, evil, she, is, the, loving, mother, who, protects, her, children, and, whose, fierceness, guards, them, she, is, outwardly, frightening, with, dark, skin, pointed, teeth, and, a, necklace, of, skulls, but, inwardly, beautiful, she, can, guarantee, a, good, rebirth, or, great, religious, insight, and, her, worship, is, often, communal, especially, at, festivals, such, as, kali, puja, and, durga, puja, worship, may, involve, contemplation, of, the, devotee, s, union, with, or, love, of, the, goddess, visualization, of, her, form, chanting, mantras, prayer, before, her, image, or, yantra, and, giving, offerings, at, tarapith, devi, s, manifestation, as, tara, she, who, saves, or, ugratara, fierce, tara, is, ascendant, as, the, goddess, who, gives, liberation, kaivalyadayini, the, forms, of, sadhana, performed, here, are, more, yogic, and, tantric, than, devotional, and, they, often, involve, sitting, alone, at, the, ground, surrounded, by, ash, and, bone, there, are, shamanic, elements, associated, with, the, tarapith, tradition, including, conquest, of, the, goddess, exorcism, trance, and, control, of, spirits, the, philosophical, and, devotional, underpinning, of, all, such, ritual, however, remains, a, pervasive, vision, of, the, devi, as, supreme, absolute, divinity, as, expressed, by, the, 19th, century, saint, ramakrishna, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, in, modern, bengali, shaktism, kali, is, none, other, than, brahman, that, which, is, called, brahman, is, really, kali, she, is, the, primal, energy, when, that, energy, remains, inactive, i, call, it, brahman, and, when, it, creates, preserves, or, destroys, i, call, it, shakti, or, kali, what, you, call, brahman, i, call, kali, brahman, and, kali, are, not, different, they, are, like, fire, and, its, power, to, burn, if, one, thinks, of, fire, one, must, think, of, its, power, to, burn, if, one, recognizes, kali, one, must, also, recognize, brahman, again, if, one, recognizes, brahman, one, must, recognize, kali, brahman, and, its, power, are, identical, it, is, brahman, whom, i, address, as, shakti, or, kali, shaktas, celebrate, most, major, hindu, festivals, as, well, as, a, huge, variety, of, local, temple, or, deity, specific, observances, a, few, of, the, more, important, events, are, listed, below, the, most, important, shakta, festival, is, navaratri, lit, festival, of, nine, nights, also, known, as, sharad, navaratri, because, it, falls, during, the, hindu, month, of, sharad, october, november, this, is, the, festival, that, worships, the, navadurgas, forms, of, devi, this, festival,
