tantalus, was, said, to, have, stolen, the, automaton, when, it, guarded, zeus, temple, or, to, have, persuaded, pandareos, to, steal, it, for, him, later, texts, attempt, to, replace, the, automaton, with, the, idea, that, the, golden, dog, was, actually, rhea, transformed, in, that, way, by, hephaestus, in, the, account, of, attic, vase, painters, hephaestus, was, present, at, the, birth, of, athena, and, wields, the, axe, with, which, he, split, zeus, head, to, free, her, in, the, latter, account, hephaestus, is, there, represented, as, older, than, athena, so, the, mythology, of, hephaestus, is, inconsistent, in, this, respect, in, one, branch, of, greek, mythology, hera, ejected, hephaestus, from, the, heavens, because, of, his, congenital, impairment, he, fell, into, the, ocean, and, was, raised, by, thetis, mother, of, achilles, and, one, of, the, 50, nereids, and, the, oceanid, eurynome, in, another, account, hephaestus, attempting, to, rescue, his, mother, from,

craftsman, by, the, sintians, an, ancient, tribe, native, to, that, island, later, writers, describe, his, physical, disability, as, the, consequence, of, his, second, fall, while, homer, makes, him, disabled, from, his, birth, hephaestus, was, one, of, the, olympians, to, have, returned, to, olympus, after, being, exiled, in, an, archaic, story, hephaestus, gained, revenge, against, hera, for, rejecting, him, by, making, her, a, magical, golden, throne, which, when, she, sat, on, it, did, not, allow, her, to, stand, up, again, the, other, gods, begged, hephaestus, to, return, to, olympus, to, let, her, go, but, he, refused, saying, i, have, no, mother, it, was, ares, who, undertook, the, task, of, fetching, hephaestus, at, first, but, he, was, threatened, by, the, fire, god, with, torches, at, last, dionysus, the, god, of, wine, fetched, him, intoxicated, him, with, wine, and, took, the, subdued, smith, back, to, olympus, on, the, back, of, a, mule, accompanied, by, revelers, a, scene, that, sometimes, appears, on, painted, pottery, of, attica, and, of, corinth, in, the, painted, scenes, the, padded, dancers, and, phallic, figures, of, the, dionysan, throng, leading, the,

promised, anything, to, hephaestus, in, order, to, free, hera, and, he, asked, for, the, hand, of, athena, in, marriage, urged, by, poseidon, who, was, hostile, toward, her, leading, to, his, attempted, rape, of, her, in, another, version, he, demanded, to, be, married, to, aphrodite, in, order, to, release, hera, and, his, mother, fulfilled, the, request, the, theme, of, the, return, of, hephaestus, popular, among, the, attic, vase, painters, whose, wares, were, favored, among, the, etruscans, may, have, introduced, this, theme, to, etruria, in, the, vase, painters, portrayal, of, the, procession, hephaestus, was, mounted, on, a, mule, or, a, horse, with, dionysus, holding, the, bridle, and, carrying, hephaestus, tools, including, a, double, headed, axe, the, traveller, pausanias, reported, seeing, a, painting, in, the, temple, of, dionysus, in, athens, which, had, been, built, in, the, 5th, century, but, may, have, been, decorated, at, any, time, before, the, 2nd, century, ce, when, pausanias, saw, it, he, said, there, are, paintings, here, dionysus, bringing, hephaestus, up, to, heaven, one, of, the, greek, legends, is, that, hephaestus, when, he, was, born, was, thrown, down, by, hera, in, revenge, he, sent, as, a, gift, a, golden, chair, with, invisible, fetters, when, hera, sat, down, she, was, held, fast, and, hephaestus, refused, to, listen, to, any, other, of, the, gods, except, dionysus, in, him, he, reposed, the, fullest, trust, and, after, making, him, drunk, dionysus, brought, him, to, heaven, though, married, to, hephaestus, aphrodite, had, an, affair, with, ares, the, god, of, war, eventually, hephaestus, discovered, aphrodite, s, affair, through, helios, the, all, seeing, sun, and, planned, a, trap, during, one, of, their, trysts, while, aphrodite, and, ares, lay, together, in, bed, hephaestus, ensnared, them, in, an, unbreakable, chain, link, net, so, small, as, to, be, invisible, and, dragged, them, to, mount, olympus, to, shame, them, in, front, of, the, other, gods, for, retribution, the, gods, laughed, at, the, sight, of, these, naked, lovers, and, poseidon, persuaded, hephaestus, to, free, them, in, return, for, a, guarantee, that, ares, would, pay, the, adulterer, s, fine, or, that, he, would, pay, it, himself, hephaestus, states, in, the, odyssey, that, he, would, return, aphrodite, to, her, father, and, demand, back, his, bride, price, the, emily, wilson, translation, depicts, hephaestus, demanding, imploring, zeus, before, poseidon, offers, however, leading, the, reader, to, assume, zeus, did, not, give, back, the, price, hephaestus, paid, for, his, daughter, and, was, thus, why, poseidon, intervened, some, versions, of, the, myth, state, that, zeus, did, not, return, the, dowry, and, in, fact, aphrodite, simply, charmed, her, way, back, again, into, her, husband, s, good, graces, in, the, iliad, hephaestus, is, described, as, married, grace, charis, during, the, events, depicted, in, the, trojan, war, while, in, the, theogony, he, is, married, to, the, grace, aglaea, the, later, dionysiaca, by, nonnus, explicitly, states, that, though, hephaestus, and, aphrodite, were, once, married, she, is, referred, to, as, his, ancient, wife, that, they, have, since, separated, and, hephaestus, is, now, married, to, charis, in, a, much, later, interpolated, detail, ares, put, the, young, soldier, alectryon, by, their, door, to, warn, them, of, helios, s, arrival, as, he, suspected, that, helios, would, tell, hephaestus, of, aphrodite, s, infidelity, if, the, two, were, discovered, but, alectryon, fell, asleep, on, guard, duty, helios, discovered, the, two, and, alerted, hephaestus, as, ares, in, rage, turned, alectryon, into, a, rooster, which, always, crows, at, dawn, when, the, sun, is, about, to, rise, announcing, its, arrival, the, thebans, told, that, the, union, of, ares, and, aphrodite, produced, harmonia, but, that, of, the, union, of, hephaestus, with, aphrodite, there, was, no, issue, however, virgil, said, that, eros, was, their, child, and, nonnus, supported, this, later, authors, explain, this, statement, by, saying, that, eros, was, sired, by, ares, but, passed, off, to, hephaestus, as, his, own, son, because, harmonia, was, conceived, during, aphrodite, s, marriage, to, hephaestus, for, revenge, on, harmonia, s, wedding, day, to, cadmus, hephaestus, gifted, her, with, a, finely, worked, but, cursed, necklace, that, brought, immense, suffering, to, her, descendants, culminating, with, the, story, of, oedipus, hephaestus, was, somehow, connected, with, the, archaic, pre, greek, phrygian, and, thracian, mystery, cult, of, the, kabeiroi, who, were, also, called, the, hephaistoi, the, hephaestus, men, in, lemnos, one, of, the, three, lemnian, tribes, also, called, themselves, hephaestion, and, claimed, direct, descent, from, the, god, hephaestus, is, to, the, male, gods, as, athena, is, to, the, female, for, he, gives, skill, to, mortal, artists, and, was, believed, to, have, taught, men, the, arts, alongside, athena, at, athens, they, had, temples, and, festivals, in, common, both, were, believed, to, have, great, healing, powers, and, lemnian, earth, terra, lemnia, from, the, spot, on, which, hephaestus, had, fallen, was, believed, to, cure, madness, the, bites, of, snakes, and, haemorrhage, and, priests, of, hephaestus, knew, how, to, cure, wounds, inflicted, by, snakes, he, was, represented, in, the, temple, of, athena, chalcioecus, athena, of, the, bronze, house, at, sparta, in, the, act, of, delivering, his, mother, on, the, chest, of, cypselus, giving, achilles, s, armor, to, thetis, and, at, athens, there, was, the, famous, statue, of, hephaestus, by, alcamenes, in, which, his, physical, disability, was, only, subtly, portrayed, he, had, almost, no, cults, except, in, athens, and, was, possibly, seen, as, a, more, approachable, god, to, the, city, which, shared, her, namesake, the, greeks, frequently, placed, miniature, statues, of, hephaestus, near, their, hearths, and, these, figures, are, the, oldest, of, all, his, representations, during, the, best, period, of, grecian, art, he, was, represented, as, a, vigorous, man, with, a, beard, and, is, characterized, by, his, hammer, or, some, other, crafting, tool, his, oval, cap, and, the, chiton, athena, is, sometimes, thought, to, be, the, soulmate, of, hephaestus, nonetheless, he, seeks, impetuously, and, passionately, to, make, love, to, athena, at, the, moment, of, climax, she, pushes, him, aside, and, his, semen, falls, to, the, earth, where, it, impregnates, gaia, in, athens, there, is, a, temple, of, hephaestus, the, hephaesteum, miscalled, the, theseum, near, the, agora, an, athenian, founding, myth, tells, that, the, city, s, patron, goddess, athena, refused, a, union, with, hephaestus, pseudo, apollodorus, records, an, archaic, legend, which, claims, that, hephaestus, once, attempted, to, rape, athena, but, she, pushed, him, away, causing, him, to, ejaculate, on, her, thigh, athena, wiped, the, semen, off, using, a, tuft, of, wool, which, she, tossed, into, the, dust, impregnating, gaia, and, causing, her, to, give, birth, to, erichthonius, whom, athena, adopted, as, her, own, child, the, roman, mythographer, hyginus, records, a, similar, story, in, which, hephaestus, demanded, zeus, to, let, him, marry, athena, since, he, was, the, one, who, had, smashed, open, zeus, s, skull, allowing, athena, to, be, born, zeus, agreed, to, this, and, hephaestus, and, athena, were, married, but, when, hephaestus, was, about, to, consummate, the, union, athena, vanished, from, the, bridal, bed, causing, him, to, ejaculate, on, the, floor, thus, impregnating, gaia, with, erichthonius, nonnus, refers, to, this, tale, of, erechthonius, being, born, of, the, earth, after, a, makeshift, marriage, but, says, that, athena, then, nursed, erechthonius, on, her, manlike, breast, some, state, that, his, origin, myth, was, that, of, a, daemon, of, fire, coming, up, from, the, earth, that, he, was, also, associated, with, gas, which, takes, fire, and, burns, is, considered, by, many, people, to, be, divine, and, that, only, later, was, a, volcano, considered, hephaestus, s, smithy, hephaestus, was, associated, by, greek, colonists, in, southern, italy, with, the, volcano, gods, adranus, of, mount, etna, and, vulcanus, of, the, lipari, islands, the, first, century, sage, apollonius, of, tyana, is, said, to, have, observed, there, are, many, other, mountains, all, over, the, earth, that, are, on, fire, and, yet, we, should, never, be, done, with, it, if, we, assigned, to, them, giants, and, gods, like, hephaestus, nevertheless, hephaestus, domain, over, fire, goes, back, to, homer, s, iliad, where, he, uses, flames, to, dry, the, waters, of, scamandrus, river, and, force, its, eponymous, deity, who, was, attacking, achilles, to, retreat, in, the, trojan, war, hephaestus, sided, with, the, greeks, but, was, also, worshipped, by, the, trojans, and, saved, one, of, their, men, from, being, killed, by, diomedes, hephaestus, favourite, place, in, the, mortal, world, was, the, island, of, lemnos, where, he, liked, to, dwell, among, the, sintians, but, he, also, frequented, other, volcanic, islands, such, as, lipari, hiera, imbros, and, sicily, which, were, called, his, abodes, or, workshops, hephaestus, fought, against, the, giants, and, killed, mimas, by, throwing, molten, iron, at, him, he, also, fought, another, giant, aristaeus, but, he, fled, during, the, battle, hephaestus, fell, down, exhausted, and, was, picked, up, by, helios, in, his, chariot, as, a, gift, of, gratitude, hephaestus, forged, four, ever, flowing, fountains, and, fire, breathing, bulls, for, helios, son, ae, tes, the, epithets, and, surnames, by, which, hephaestus, is, known, by, the, poets, generally, allude, to, his, skill, in, the, plastic, arts, or, to, his, figure, or, disability, the, greeks, frequently, placed, miniature, statues, of, hephaestus, near, their, hearths, and, these, figures, are, the, oldest, of, all, his, representations, at, the, marriage, of, peleus, and, thetis, he, gave, a, knife, as, a, wedding, present, according, to, most, versions, hephaestus, s, consort, is, aphrodite, who, is, unfaithful, to, hephaestus, with, a, number, of, gods, and, mortals, including, ares, see, hephaestus, and, aphrodite, above, however, some, sources, say, that, hephaestus, is, married, to, one, of, the, charites, in, book, xviii, of, homer, s, iliad, the, consort, of, hephaestus, is, charis, the, grace, with, whom, he, lives, in, a, bronze, wrought, home, on, olympus, a, name, used, later, in, nonnus, s, dionysiaca, however, hesiod, names, the, member, of, the, charites, who, is, married, to, hephaestus, as, aglaea, and, the, orphic, fragments, compiled, by, otto, kern, say, that, by, hephaestus, aglaea, became, mother, of, eucleia, good, repute, eupheme, acclaim, euthenia, prosperity, and, philophrosyne, welcome, some, scholars, conclude, that, these, references, refer, to, the, same, goddess, under, different, names, although, in, the, dionysiaca, both, aglaea, and, charis, appear, as, separate, characters, aglaea, refers, to, charis, as, a, separate, attendant, of, aphrodite, when, speaking, to, eros, k, roly, ker, nyi, notes, that, charis, also, means, the, delightfulness, of, art, and, supposes, that, aphrodite, is, viewed, as, a, work, of, art, speculating, that, aphrodite, could, also, have, been, called, charis, as, an, alternative, name, for, in, the, odyssey, homer, suddenly, makes, her, his, wife, on, the, island, of, lemnos, hephaestus, consort, was, the, sea, nymph, cabeiro, by, whom, he, was, the, father, of, two, metalworking, gods, named, the, cabeiri, in, sicily, his, consort, was, the, nymph, aetna, and, his, sons, were, two, gods, of, sicilian, geysers, called, palici, who, are, elsewhere, called,
