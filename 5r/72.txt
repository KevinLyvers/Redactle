existence, is, the, state, of, having, being, or, reality, in, contrast, to, nonexistence, and, nonbeing, existence, is, often, contrasted, with, essence, the, essence, of, an, entity, is, its, essential, features, or, qualities, which, can, be, understood, even, if, one, does, not, know, whether, the, entity, exists, ontology, is, the, philosophical, discipline, studying, the, nature, and, types, of, existence, singular, existence, is, the, existence, of, individual, entities, while, general, existence, refers, to, the, existence, of, concepts, or, universals, entities, present, in, space, and, time, have, concrete, existence, in, contrast, to, abstract, entities, like, numbers, and, sets, other, distinctions, are, between, possible, contingent, and, necessary, existence, and, between, physical, and, mental, existence, the, common, view, is, that, an, entity, either, exists, or, not, with, nothing, in, between, but, some, philosophers, say, that, there, are, degrees, of, existence, meaning, that, some, entities, exist, to, a, higher, degree, than, others, the, orthodox, position, in, ontology, is, that, existence, is, a, second, order, property, or, a, property, of, properties, for, example, to, say, that, lions, exist, means, that, the, property, of, being, a, lion, is, possessed, by, an, entity, a, different, view, states, that, existence, is, a, first, order, property, or, a, property, of, individuals, this, means, existence, is, similar, to, other, properties, of, individuals, like, color, and, shape, alexius, meinong, and, his, followers, accept, this, idea, and, say, that, not, all, individuals, have, this, property, they, state, that, there, are, some, individuals, such, as, santa, claus, that, do, not, exist, universalists, reject, this, view, they, see, existence, as, a, universal, property, of, every, individual, the, concept, of, existence, has, been, discussed, throughout, the, history, of, philosophy, and, already, played, a, role, in, ancient, philosophy, including, presocratic, philosophy, in, ancient, greece, hindu, and, buddhist, philosophy, in, ancient, india, and, daoist, philosophy, in, ancient, china, it, is, relevant, to, fields, such, as, logic, mathematics, epistemology, philosophy, of, mind, philosophy, of, language, and, existentialism, dictionaries, define, existence, as, the, state, of, being, real, and, to, exist, as, having, being, or, participating, in, reality, existence, sets, real, entities, apart, from, imaginary, ones, and, can, refer, both, to, individual, entities, or, to, the, totality, of, reality, the, word, existence, entered, the, english, language, in, the, late, 14th, century, from, old, french, and, has, its, roots, in, the, medieval, latin, term, ex, s, istere, which, means, to, stand, forth, to, appear, and, to, arise, existence, is, studied, by, the, subdiscipline, of, metaphysics, known, as, ontology, the, terms, being, reality, and, actuality, are, often, used, as, synonyms, of, existence, but, the, exact, definition, of, existence, and, its, connection, to, these, terms, is, disputed, according, to, metaphysician, alexius, meinong, 1853, 1920, all, entities, have, being, but, not, all, entities, have, existence, he, argues, merely, possible, objects, like, santa, claus, have, being, but, lack, existence, ontologist, takashi, yagisawa, 20th, century, present, contrasts, existence, with, reality, he, sees, reality, as, the, more, fundamental, term, because, it, equally, characterizes, all, entities, and, defines, existence, as, a, relative, term, that, connects, an, entity, to, the, world, it, inhabits, according, to, philosopher, gottlob, frege, 1848, 1925, actuality, is, narrower, than, existence, because, only, actual, entities, can, produce, and, undergo, changes, in, contrast, to, non, actual, existing, entities, like, numbers, and, sets, according, to, some, philosophers, like, edmund, husserl, 1859, 1938, existence, is, an, elementary, concept, meaning, it, cannot, be, defined, in, other, terms, without, involving, circularity, this, would, imply, characterizing, existence, or, talking, about, its, nature, in, a, non, trivial, manner, may, be, difficult, or, impossible, disputes, about, the, nature, of, existence, are, reflected, in, the, distinction, between, thin, and, thick, concepts, of, existence, thin, concepts, of, existence, understand, existence, as, a, logical, property, that, every, existing, thing, shares, they, do, not, include, any, substantial, content, about, the, metaphysical, implications, of, having, existence, according, to, one, view, existence, is, the, same, as, the, logical, property, of, self, identity, this, view, articulates, a, thin, concept, of, existence, because, it, merely, states, what, exists, is, identical, to, itself, without, discussing, any, substantial, characteristics, of, the, nature, of, existence, thick, concepts, of, existence, encompass, a, metaphysical, analysis, of, what, it, means, that, something, exists, and, what, essential, features, existence, implies, according, to, one, proposal, to, exist, is, to, be, present, in, space, and, time, and, to, have, effects, on, other, things, this, definition, is, controversial, because, it, implies, abstract, objects, such, as, numbers, do, not, exist, philosopher, george, berkeley, 1685, 1753, gave, a, different, thick, concept, of, existence, he, stated, to, be, is, to, be, perceived, meaning, all, existence, is, mental, existence, contrasts, with, nonexistence, a, lack, of, reality, whether, objects, can, be, divided, into, existent, and, nonexistent, objects, is, a, subject, of, controversy, this, distinction, is, sometimes, used, to, explain, how, it, is, possible, to, think, of, fictional, objects, like, dragons, and, unicorns, but, the, concept, of, nonexistent, objects, is, not, generally, accepted, some, philosophers, say, the, concept, is, contradictory, closely, related, contrasting, terms, are, nothingness, and, nonbeing, existence, is, commonly, associated, with, mind, independent, reality, but, this, position, is, not, universally, accepted, because, there, could, also, be, forms, of, mind, dependent, existence, such, as, the, existence, of, an, idea, inside, a, person, s, mind, according, to, some, idealists, this, may, apply, to, all, of, reality, another, contrast, is, made, between, existence, and, essence, essence, refers, to, the, intrinsic, nature, or, defining, qualities, of, an, entity, the, essence, of, something, determines, what, kind, of, entity, it, is, and, how, it, differs, from, other, kinds, of, entities, essence, corresponds, to, what, an, entity, is, while, existence, corresponds, to, the, fact, that, it, is, for, instance, it, is, possible, to, understand, what, an, object, is, and, grasp, its, nature, even, if, one, does, not, know, whether, this, object, exists, according, to, some, philosophers, there, is, a, difference, between, entities, and, the, fundamental, characteristics, that, make, them, the, entities, they, are, martin, heidegger, 1889, 1976, introduced, this, concept, he, calls, it, the, ontological, difference, and, contrasts, individual, beings, with, being, according, to, his, response, to, the, question, of, being, being, is, not, an, entity, but, the, background, context, that, makes, all, individual, entities, intelligible, many, discussions, of, the, types, of, existing, entities, revolve, around, the, definitions, of, different, types, the, existence, or, nonexistence, of, entities, of, a, specific, type, the, ways, entities, of, different, types, are, related, to, each, other, and, whether, some, types, are, more, fundamental, than, others, examples, are, the, existence, or, nonexistence, of, souls, whether, there, are, abstract, fictional, and, universal, entities, and, the, existence, or, nonexistence, of, possible, worlds, and, objects, besides, the, actual, world, these, discussions, cover, the, topics, of, the, basic, stuff, or, constituents, underlying, all, reality, and, the, most, general, features, of, entities, there, is, a, distinction, between, singular, existence, and, general, existence, singular, existence, is, the, existence, of, individual, entities, for, example, the, sentence, angela, merkel, exists, expresses, the, existence, of, one, particular, person, general, existence, pertains, to, general, concepts, properties, or, universals, for, instance, the, sentence, politicians, exist, states, the, general, term, politician, has, instances, without, referring, to, a, particular, politician, singular, and, general, existence, are, closely, related, to, each, other, and, some, philosophers, have, tried, to, explain, one, as, a, special, case, of, the, other, for, example, according, to, frege, general, existence, is, more, basic, than, singular, existence, one, argument, in, favor, of, this, position, is, that, singular, existence, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, general, existence, for, instance, the, sentence, angela, merkel, exists, can, be, expressed, as, entities, that, are, identical, to, angela, merkel, exist, where, the, expression, being, identical, to, angela, merkel, is, understood, as, a, general, term, philosopher, willard, van, orman, quine, 1908, 2000, defends, a, different, position, by, giving, primacy, to, singular, existence, and, arguing, that, general, existence, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, singular, existence, a, related, question, is, whether, there, can, be, general, existence, without, singular, existence, according, to, philosopher, henry, s, leonard, 1905, 1967, a, property, only, has, general, existence, if, there, is, at, least, one, actual, object, that, instantiates, it, philosopher, nicholas, rescher, 1928, 2024, by, contrast, states, that, properties, can, exist, if, they, have, no, actual, instances, like, the, property, of, being, a, unicorn, this, question, has, a, long, philosophical, tradition, in, relation, to, the, existence, of, universals, according, to, platonists, universals, have, general, existence, as, platonic, forms, independently, of, the, particulars, that, exemplify, them, according, to, this, view, the, universal, of, redness, exists, independently, of, the, existence, or, nonexistence, of, red, objects, aristotelianism, also, accepts, the, existence, of, universals, but, says, their, existence, depends, on, particulars, that, instantiate, them, and, that, they, are, unable, to, exist, by, themselves, according, to, this, view, a, universal, that, is, not, present, in, the, space, and, time, does, not, exist, according, to, nominalists, only, particulars, have, existence, and, universals, do, not, exist, there, is, an, influential, distinction, in, ontology, between, concrete, and, abstract, objects, many, concrete, objects, like, rocks, plants, and, other, people, are, encountered, in, everyday, life, they, exist, in, space, and, time, they, have, effects, on, each, other, like, when, a, rock, falls, on, a, plant, and, damages, it, or, a, plant, grows, through, rock, and, breaks, it, abstract, objects, like, numbers, sets, and, types, have, no, location, in, space, and, time, and, lack, causal, powers, the, distinction, between, concrete, objects, and, abstract, objects, is, sometimes, treated, as, the, most, general, division, of, being, the, existence, of, concrete, objects, is, widely, agreed, upon, but, opinions, about, abstract, objects, are, divided, realists, such, as, plato, accept, the, idea, that, abstract, objects, have, independent, existence, some, realists, say, abstract, objects, have, the, same, mode, of, existence, as, concrete, objects, according, to, others, they, exist, in, a, different, way, anti, realists, state, abstract, objects, do, not, exist, a, view, that, is, often, combined, with, the, idea, that, existence, requires, a, location, in, space, and, time, or, the, ability, to, causally, interact, a, further, distinction, is, between, merely, possible, contingent, and, necessary, existence, an, entity, has, necessary, existence, if, it, must, exist, or, could, not, fail, to, exist, this, means, that, it, is, not, possible, to, newly, create, or, destroy, necessary, entities, entities, that, exist, but, could, fail, to, exist, are, contingent, merely, possible, entities, do, not, exist, but, could, exist, most, entities, encountered, in, ordinary, experience, like, telephones, sticks, and, flowers, have, contingent, existence, the, contingent, existence, of, telephones, is, reflected, in, the, fact, that, they, exist, in, the, present, but, did, not, exist, in, the, past, meaning, that, it, is, not, necessary, that, they, exist, it, is, an, open, question, whether, any, entities, have, necessary, existence, according, to, some, nominalists, all, concrete, objects, have, contingent, existence, while, all, abstract, objects, have, necessary, existence, according, to, some, theorists, one, or, several, necessary, beings, are, required, as, the, explanatory, foundation, of, the, cosmos, for, instance, the, philosophers, avicenna, 980, 1037, and, thomas, aquinas, 1225, 1274, say, that, god, has, necessary, existence, a, few, philosophers, like, baruch, spinoza, 1632, 1677, see, god, and, the, world, as, the, same, thing, and, say, that, all, entities, have, necessary, existence, to, provide, a, unified, and, rational, explanation, of, everything, there, are, many, academic, debates, about, the, existence, of, merely, possible, objects, according, to, actualism, only, actual, entities, have, being, this, includes, both, contingent, and, necessary, entities, but, excludes, merely, possible, entities, possibilists, reject, this, view, and, state, there, are, also, merely, possible, objects, besides, actual, objects, for, example, metaphysician, david, lewis, 1941, 2001, states, that, possible, objects, exist, in, the, same, way, as, actual, objects, so, as, to, provide, a, robust, explanation, of, why, statements, about, what, is, possible, and, necessary, are, true, according, to, him, possible, objects, exist, in, possible, worlds, while, actual, objects, exist, in, the, actual, world, lewis, says, the, only, difference, between, possible, worlds, and, the, actual, world, is, the, location, of, the, speaker, the, term, actual, refers, to, the, world, of, the, speaker, similar, to, the, way, the, terms, here, and, now, refer, to, the, spatial, and, temporal, location, of, the, speaker, the, problem, of, contingent, and, necessary, existence, is, closely, related, to, the, ontological, question, of, why, there, is, anything, at, all, or, why, is, there, something, rather, than, nothing, according, to, one, view, the, existence, of, something, is, a, contingent, fact, meaning, the, world, could, have, been, totally, empty, this, is, not, possible, if, there, are, necessary, entities, which, could, not, have, failed, to, exist, in, this, case, global, nothingness, is, impossible, because, the, world, needs, to, contain, at, least, all, necessary, entities, entities, that, exist, on, a, physical, level, include, objects, encountered, in, everyday, life, like, stones, trees, and, human, bodies, as, well, as, entities, discussed, in, modern, physics, like, electrons, and, protons, physical, entities, can, be, observed, and, measured, they, possess, mass, and, a, location, in, space, and, time, mental, entities, like, perceptions, experiences, of, pleasure, and, pain, as, well, as, beliefs, desires, and, emotions, belong, to, the, realm, of, the, mind, they, are, primarily, associated, with, conscious, experiences, but, also, include, unconscious, states, like, unconscious, beliefs, desires, and, memories, the, mind, body, problem, concerns, the, ontological, status, of, and, relation, between, physical, and, mental, entities, and, is, a, frequent, topic, in, metaphysics, and, philosophy, of, mind, according, to, materialists, only, physical, entities, exist, on, the, most, fundamental, level, materialists, usually, explain, mental, entities, in, terms, of, physical, processes, for, example, as, brain, states, or, as, patterns, of, neural, activation, idealism, a, minority, view, in, contemporary, philosophy, rejects, matter, as, ultimate, and, views, the, mind, as, the, most, basic, reality, dualists, like, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, believe, both, physical, and, mental, entities, exist, on, the, most, fundamental, level, they, state, they, are, connected, to, one, another, in, several, ways, but, that, one, cannot, be, reduced, to, the, other, fictional, entities, are, entities, that, exist, as, inventions, inside, works, of, fiction, for, example, sherlock, holmes, is, a, fictional, character, in, arthur, conan, doyle, s, book, a, study, in, scarlet, and, flying, carpets, are, fictional, objects, in, the, folktales, one, thousand, and, one, nights, according, to, anti, realism, fictional, entities, do, not, form, part, of, reality, in, any, substantive, sense, possibilists, by, contrast, see, fictional, entities, as, a, subclass, of, possible, objects, creationists, say, that, they, are, artifacts, that, depend, for, their, existence, on, the, authors, who, first, conceived, them, intentional, inexistence, is, a, similar, phenomenon, concerned, with, the, existence, of, objects, within, mental, states, this, happens, when, a, person, perceives, or, thinks, about, an, object, in, some, cases, the, intentional, object, corresponds, to, a, real, object, outside, the, mental, state, like, when, accurately, perceiving, a, tree, in, the, garden, in, other, cases, the, intentional, object, does, not, have, a, real, counterpart, like, when, thinking, about, bigfoot, the, problem, of, intentional, inexistence, is, the, challenge, of, explaining, how, one, can, think, about, entities, that, do, not, exist, since, this, seems, to, have, the, paradoxical, implication, that, the, thinker, stands, in, a, relation, to, a, non, existing, object, closely, related, to, the, problem, of, different, types, of, entities, is, the, question, of, whether, their, modes, of, existence, also, vary, this, is, the, case, according, to, ontological, pluralism, which, states, entities, belonging, to, different, types, differ, in, both, their, essential, features, and, in, the, ways, they, exist, this, position, is, sometimes, found, in, theology, it, states, god, is, radically, different, from, his, creation, and, emphasizes, his, uniqueness, by, saying, the, difference, affects, both, god, s, features, and, god, s, mode, of, existence, another, form, of, ontological, pluralism, distinguishes, the, existence, of, material, objects, from, the, existence, of, space, time, according, to, this, view, material, objects, have, relative, existence, because, they, exist, in, space, time, the, existence, of, space, time, itself, is, not, relative, in, this, sense, because, it, just, exists, without, existing, within, another, space, time, the, topic, of, degrees, of, existence, is, closely, related, to, the, problem, of, modes, of, existence, this, topic, is, based, on, the, idea, that, some, entities, exist, to, a, higher, degree, or, have, more, being, than, other, entities, similar, to, the, way, some, properties, such, as, heat, and, mass, have, degrees, according, to, philosopher, plato, 428, 427, 348, 347, bce, for, example, unchangeable, platonic, forms, have, a, higher, degree, of, existence, than, physical, objects, the, view, that, there, are, different, types, of, entities, is, common, in, metaphysics, but, the, idea, that, they, differ, from, each, other, in, their, modes, or, degrees, of, existence, is, often, rejected, implying, that, a, thing, either, exists, or, does, not, exist, without, in, between, alternatives, metaphysician, peter, van, inwagen, 1942, present, uses, the, idea, that, there, is, an, intimate, relationship, between, existence, and, quantification, to, argue, against, different, modes, of, existence, quantification, is, related, to, the, counting, of, objects, according, to, inwagen, if, there, were, different, modes, of, entities, people, would, need, different, types, of, numbers, to, count, them, because, the, same, numbers, can, be, used, to, count, different, types, of, entities, he, concludes, all, entities, have, the, same, mode, of, existence, theories, of, the, nature, of, existence, aim, to, explain, what, it, means, for, something, to, exist, a, central, dispute, in, the, academic, discourse, about, the, nature, of, existence, is, whether, existence, is, a, property, of, individuals, an, individual, is, a, unique, entity, like, socrates, or, a, particular, apple, a, property, is, something, that, is, attributed, to, an, entity, like, being, human, or, being, red, and, usually, expresses, a, quality, or, feature, of, that, entity, the, two, main, theories, of, existence, are, first, order, and, second, order, theories, first, order, theories, understand, existence, as, a, property, of, individuals, while, second, order, theories, say, existence, is, a, second, order, property, that, is, a, property, of, properties, a, central, challenge, for, theories, of, the, nature, of, existence, is, an, understanding, of, the, possibility, of, coherently, denying, the, existence, of, something, like, the, statement, santa, claus, does, not, exist, one, difficulty, is, explaining, how, the, name, santa, claus, can, be, meaningful, even, though, there, is, no, santa, claus, second, order, theories, understand, existence, as, a, second, order, property, rather, than, a, first, order, property, they, are, often, seen, as, the, orthodox, position, in, ontology, for, instance, the, empire, state, building, is, an, individual, object, and, being, 443, 2, meters, 1, 454, ft, tall, is, a, first, order, property, of, it, being, instantiated, is, a, property, of, being, 443, 2, meters, tall, and, therefore, a, second, order, property, according, to, second, order, theories, to, talk, about, existence, is, to, talk, about, which, properties, have, instances, for, example, this, view, says, that, the, sentence, god, exists, means, godhood, is, instantiated, rather, than, god, has, the, property, of, existing, a, key, reason, against, characterizing, existence, as, a, property, of, individuals, is, that, existence, differs, from, regular, properties, regular, properties, such, as, being, a, building, and, being, 443, 2, meters, tall, express, what, an, object, is, like, but, do, not, directly, describe, whether, or, not, that, building, exists, according, to, this, view, existence, is, more, fundamental, than, regular, properties, because, an, object, cannot, have, any, properties, if, it, does, not, exist, according, to, second, order, theorists, quantifiers, rather, than, predicates, express, existence, predicates, are, expressions, that, apply, to, and, classify, objects, usually, by, attributing, features, to, them, such, as, is, a, butterfly, and, is, happy, quantifiers, are, terms, that, talk, about, the, quantity, of, objects, that, have, certain, properties, existential, quantifiers, express, that, there, is, at, least, one, object, like, the, expressions, some, and, there, exists, as, in, some, cows, eat, grass, and, there, exists, an, even, prime, number, in, this, regard, existence, is, closely, related, to, counting, because, to, assert, that, something, exists, is, to, assert, that, the, corresponding, concept, has, one, or, more, instances, second, order, views, imply, a, sentence, like, egg, laying, mammals, exist, is, misleading, because, the, word, exist, is, used, as, a, predicate, in, them, these, views, say, the, true, logical, form, is, better, expressed, in, reformulations, like, there, exist, entities, that, are, egg, laying, mammals, this, way, existence, has, the, role, of, a, quantifier, and, egg, laying, mammals, is, the, predicate, quantifier, constructions, can, also, be, used, to, express, negative, existential, statements, for, instance, the, sentence, talking, tigers, do, not, exist, can, be, expressed, as, it, is, not, the, case, that, there, exist, talking, tigers, many, ontologists, accept, that, second, order, theories, provide, a, correct, analysis, of, many, types, of, existential, sentences, it, is, however, controversial, whether, it, is, correct, for, all, cases, some, problems, relate, to, assumptions, associated, with, everyday, language, about, sentences, like, ronald, mcdonald, does, not, exist, this, type, of, statement, is, called, negative, singular, existential, and, the, expression, ronald, mcdonald, is, a, singular, term, that, seems, to, refer, to, an, individual, it, is, not, clear, how, the, expression, can, refer, to, an, individual, if, as, the, sentence, asserts, this, individual, does, not, exist, according, to, a, solution, philosopher, bertrand, russell, 1872, 1970, proposed, singular, terms, do, not, refer, to, individuals, but, are, descriptions, of, individuals, this, theory, states, negative, singular, existentials, deny, an, object, matching, the, descriptions, exists, without, referring, to, a, non, existent, individual, following, this, approach, the, sentence, ronald, mcdonald, does, not, exist, expresses, the, idea, it, is, not, the, case, there, is, a, unique, happy, hamburger, clown, according, to, first, order, theories, existence, is, a, property, of, individuals, these, theories, are, less, widely, accepted, than, second, order, theories, but, also, have, some, influential, proponents, there, are, two, types, of, first, order, theories, meinongianism, and, universalism, meinongianism, which, describes, existence, as, a, property, of, some, but, not, all, entities, was, first, formulated, by, alexius, meinong, its, main, assertion, is, that, there, are, some, entities, that, do, not, exist, meaning, objecthood, is, independent, of, existence, proposed, examples, of, nonexistent, objects, are, merely, possible, objects, such, as, flying, pigs, as, well, as, fictional, and, mythical, objects, like, sherlock, holmes, and, zeus, according, to, this, view, these, objects, are, real, and, have, being, even, though, they, do, not, exist, meinong, states, there, is, an, object, for, any, combination, of, properties, for, example, there, is, an, object, that, only, has, the, single, property, of, being, a, singer, with, no, other, properties, this, means, neither, the, attribute, of, wearing, a, dress, nor, the, absence, of, it, applies, to, this, object, meinong, also, includes, impossible, objects, like, round, squares, in, this, classification, according, to, meinongians, sentences, describing, sherlock, holmes, and, zeus, refer, to, nonexisting, objects, they, are, true, or, false, depending, on, whether, these, objects, have, the, properties, ascribed, to, them, for, instance, the, sentence, pegasus, has, wings, is, true, because, having, wings, is, a, property, of, pegasus, even, though, pegasus, lacks, the, property, of, existing, one, key, motivation, of, meinongianism, is, to, explain, how, negative, singular, existentials, like, ronald, mcdonald, does, not, exist, can, be, true, meinongians, accept, the, idea, that, singular, terms, like, ronald, mcdonald, refer, to, individuals, for, them, a, negative, singular, existential, is, true, if, the, individual, it, refers, to, does, not, exist, meinongianism, has, important, implications, for, understandings, of, quantification, according, to, an, influential, view, defended, by, willard, van, orman, quine, the, domain, of, quantification, is, restricted, to, existing, objects, this, view, implies, quantifiers, carry, ontological, commitments, about, what, exists, and, what, does, not, exist, meinongianism, differs, from, this, view, by, saying, the, widest, domain, of, quantification, includes, both, existing, and, nonexisting, objects, some, aspects, of, meinongianism, are, controversial, and, have, received, substantial, criticism, according, to, one, objection, one, cannot, distinguish, between, being, an, object, and, being, an, existing, object, a, closely, related, criticism, states, objects, cannot, have, properties, if, they, do, not, exist, a, further, objection, is, that, meinongianism, leads, to, an, overpopulated, universe, because, there, is, an, object, corresponding, to, any, combination, of, properties, a, more, specific, criticism, rejects, the, idea, that, there, are, incomplete, and, impossible, objects, universalists, agree, with, meinongians, that, existence, is, a, property, of, individuals, but, deny, there, are, nonexistent, entities, instead, universalists, state, existence, is, a, universal, property, all, entities, have, it, meaning, everything, exists, one, approach, is, to, say, existence, is, the, same, as, self, identity, according, to, the, law, of, identity, every, object, is, identical, to, itself, or, has, the, property, of, self, identity, this, can, be, expressed, in, predicate, logic, as, x, x, x, displaystyle, forall, x, x, x, an, influential, argument, in, favor, of, universalism, is, that, the, denial, of, the, existence, of, something, is, contradictory, this, conclusion, follows, from, the, premises, that, one, can, only, deny, the, existence, of, something, by, referring, to, that, entity, and, that, one, can, only, refer, to, entities, that, exist, universalists, have, proposed, different, ways, of, interpreting, negative, singular, existentials, according, to, one, view, names, of, fictional, entities, like, ronald, mcdonald, refer, to, abstract, objects, which, exist, even, though, they, do, not, exist, in, space, and, time, this, means, when, understood, in, a, strict, sense, all, negative, singular, existentials, are, false, including, the, assertion, that, ronald, mcdonald, does, not, exist, universalists, can, interpret, such, sentences, slightly, differently, in, relation, to, the, context, in, everyday, life, for, example, people, use, sentences, like, ronald, mcdonald, does, not, exist, to, express, the, idea, that, ronald, mcdonald, does, not, exist, as, a, concrete, object, which, is, true, another, approach, is, to, understand, negative, singular, existentials, as, neither, true, nor, false, but, meaningless, because, their, singular, terms, do, not, refer, to, anything, western, philosophy, originated, with, the, presocratic, philosophers, who, aimed, to, replace, earlier, mythological, accounts, of, the, universe, by, providing, rational, explanations, based, on, foundational, principles, of, all, existence, some, like, thales, c, 624, 545, bce, and, heraclitus, c, 540, 480, bce, suggested, concrete, principles, like, water, and, fire, are, the, root, of, existence, anaximander, c, 610, 545, bce, opposed, this, position, he, believed, the, source, must, lie, in, an, abstract, principle, that, is, beyond, the, world, of, human, perception, plato, 428, 427, 348, 347, bce, argued, that, different, types, of, entities, have, different, degrees, of, existence, and, that, shadows, and, images, exist, in, a, weaker, sense, than, regular, material, objects, he, said, unchangeable, platonic, forms, have, the, highest, type, of, existence, and, saw, material, objects, as, imperfect, and, impermanent, copies, of, platonic, forms, philosopher, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, accepted, plato, s, idea, that, forms, are, different, from, matter, but, he, challenged, the, idea, that, forms, have, a, higher, type, of, existence, instead, he, believed, forms, cannot, exist, without, matter, he, stated, being, is, said, in, many, ways, and, explored, how, different, types, of, entities, have, different, modes, of, existence, for, example, he, distinguished, between, substances, and, their, accidents, and, between, potentiality, and, actuality, neoplatonists, like, plotinus, 204, 270, ce, suggested, reality, has, a, hierarchical, structure, they, believed, a, transcendent, entity, called, the, one, or, the, good, is, responsible, for, all, existence, from, it, emerges, the, intellect, which, in, turn, gives, rise, to, the, soul, and, the, material, world, in, medieval, philosophy, anselm, of, canterbury, 1033, 1109, ce, formulated, the, influential, ontological, argument, which, aims, to, deduce, the, existence, of, god, from, the, concept, of, god, anselm, defined, god, as, the, greatest, conceivable, being, he, reasoned, that, an, entity, that, did, not, exist, outside, his, mind, would, not, be, the, greatest, conceivable, being, leading, him, to, the, conclusion, god, exists, thomas, aquinas, 1224, 1274, ce, distinguished, between, the, essence, of, a, thing, and, its, existence, according, to, him, the, essence, of, a, thing, constitutes, its, fundamental, nature, he, argued, it, is, possible, to, understand, what, an, object, is, and, grasp, its, essence, even, if, one, does, not, know, whether, the, object, exists, he, concluded, from, this, observation, that, existence, is, not, part, of, the, qualities, of, an, object, and, should, be, understood, as, a, separate, property, aquinas, also, considered, the, problem, of, creation, from, nothing, and, said, only, god, has, the, power, to, truly, bring, new, entities, into, existence, these, ideas, later, inspired, metaphysician, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, s, 1646, 1716, theory, of, creation, leibniz, said, to, create, is, to, confer, actual, existence, to, possible, objects, the, philosophers, david, hume, 1711, 1776, and, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, rejected, the, idea, that, existence, is, a, property, according, to, hume, objects, are, bundles, of, qualities, he, said, existence, is, not, a, property, because, there, is, no, impression, of, existence, besides, the, bundled, qualities, kant, came, to, a, similar, conclusion, in, his, criticism, of, the, ontological, argument, according, to, him, this, proof, fails, because, one, cannot, deduce, from, the, definition, of, a, concept, whether, entities, described, by, this, concept, exist, kant, said, existence, does, not, add, anything, to, the, concept, of, the, object, it, only, indicates, this, concept, is, exemplified, according, to, philosopher, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, there, is, no, pure, being, or, pure, nothing, only, becoming, philosopher, and, psychologist, franz, brentano, 1838, 1917, agreed, with, kant, s, criticism, and, his, position, that, existence, is, not, a, real, predicate, brentano, used, this, idea, to, develop, his, theory, of, judgments, which, states, all, judgments, are, existential, judgments, they, either, affirm, or, deny, the, existence, of, something, he, stated, judgments, like, some, zebras, are, striped, have, the, logical, form, there, is, a, striped, zebra, while, judgments, like, all, zebras, are, striped, have, the, logical, form, there, is, not, a, non, striped, zebra, gottlob, frege, 1848, 1925, and, bertrand, russell, 1872, 1970, aimed, to, refine, the, idea, of, what, it, means, that, existence, is, not, a, regular, property, they, distinguished, between, regular, first, order, properties, of, individuals, and, second, order, properties, of, other, properties, according, to, their, view, existence, is, the, second, order, property, of, being, instantiated, russell, further, developed, the, idea, that, general, sentences, like, lions, exist, are, at, their, most, fundamental, form, about, individuals, by, stating, that, there, is, an, individual, that, is, a, lion, willard, van, orman, quine, 1908, 2000, followed, frege, and, russell, in, accepting, existence, as, a, second, order, property, he, drew, a, close, link, between, existence, and, the, role, of, quantification, in, formal, logic, he, applied, this, idea, to, scientific, theories, and, stated, a, scientific, theory, is, committed, to, the, existence, of, an, entity, if, the, theory, quantifies, over, this, entity, for, example, if, a, theory, in, biology, asserts, that, there, are, populations, with, genetic, diversity, this, theory, has, an, ontological, commitment, to, the, existence, of, populations, with, genetic, diversity, alexius, meinong, 1853, 1920, was, an, influential, critic, of, second, order, theories, and, developed, the, alternative, view, that, existence, is, a, property, of, individuals, and, that, not, all, individuals, have, this, property, many, schools, of, thought, in, eastern, philosophy, discuss, the, problem, of, existence, and, its, implications, for, instance, the, ancient, hindu, school, of, samkhya, articulated, a, metaphysical, dualism, according, to, which, the, two, types, of, existence, are, pure, consciousness, purusha, and, matter, prakriti, samkhya, explains, the, manifestation, of, the, universe, as, the, interaction, between, these, two, principles, the, vedic, philosopher, adi, shankara, c, 700, 750, ce, developed, a, different, approach, in, his, school, of, advaita, vedanta, shankara, defended, a, metaphysical, monism, by, defining, the, divine, brahman, as, the, ultimate, reality, and, the, only, existent, according, to, this, view, the, impression, that, there, is, a, universe, consisting, of, many, distinct, entities, is, an, illusion, maya, the, essential, features, of, ultimate, reality, are, described, as, sat, chit, ananda, meaning, existence, consciousness, and, bliss, a, central, doctrine, in, buddhist, philosophy, is, called, the, three, marks, of, existence, which, are, anicc, impermanence, anatt, absence, of, a, permanent, self, and, dukkha, suffering, anicc, is, the, doctrine, that, all, of, existence, is, subject, to, change, meaning, everything, changes, at, some, point, and, nothing, lasts, forever, anatt, expresses, a, similar, state, in, relation, to, persons, by, stating, that, people, do, not, have, a, permanent, identity, or, a, separate, self, ignorance, about, anicc, and, anatt, is, seen, as, the, main, cause, of, dukkha, by, leading, people, to, form, attachments, that, cause, suffering, a, central, idea, in, many, schools, of, chinese, philosophy, like, laozi, s, 6th, century, bce, daoism, is, that, a, fundamental, principle, known, as, dao, is, the, source, of, all, existence, the, term, is, often, translated, as, the, way, and, is, understood, as, a, cosmic, force, that, governs, the, natural, order, of, the, world, chinese, metaphysicians, debated, whether, dao, is, a, form, of, being, or, whether, as, the, source, of, being, it, belongs, to, non, being, the, concept, of, existence, played, a, central, role, in, arabic, persian, philosophy, the, islamic, philosophers, avicenna, 980, 1037, ce, and, al, ghazali, 1058, 1111, ce, discussed, the, relationship, between, existence, and, essence, and, said, the, essence, of, an, entity, is, prior, to, its, existence, the, additional, step, of, instantiating, the, essence, is, required, for, the, entity, to, come, into, existence, philosopher, mulla, sadra, 1571, 1636, ce, rejected, this, priority, of, essence, over, existence, and, said, essence, is, only, a, concept, that, is, used, by, the, mind, to, grasp, existence, existence, by, contrast, encompasses, the, whole, of, reality, according, to, his, view, indigenous, american, philosophies, tend, to, emphasize, the, interconnectedness, of, all, existence, and, the, importance, of, maintaining, balance, and, harmony, with, nature, this, is, often, combined, with, an, animist, outlook, that, ascribes, a, spiritual, essence, to, some, or, all, entities, including, plants, rocks, and, places, the, interest, in, the, relational, aspect, of, existence, is, also, found, in, african, philosophy, which, explores, how, all, entities, are, causally, linked, to, form, an, ordered, world, african, philosophy, also, examines, the, idea, of, an, underlying, and, all, pervading, life, force, responsible, for, animating, entities, and, their, influence, on, each, other, formal, logic, studies, deductively, valid, arguments, in, first, order, logic, which, is, the, most, commonly, used, system, of, formal, logic, existence, is, expressed, using, the, existential, quantifier, displaystyle, exists, for, example, the, formula, x, horse, x, displaystyle, exists, x, text, horse, x, can, be, used, to, state, horses, exist, the, variable, x, ranges, over, all, elements, in, the, domain, of, quantification, and, the, existential, quantifier, expresses, that, at, least, one, element, in, this, domain, is, a, horse, in, first, order, logic, all, singular, terms, like, names, refer, to, objects, in, the, domain, and, imply, the, object, exists, because, of, this, one, can, deduce, x, honest, x, displaystyle, exists, x, text, honest, x, someone, is, honest, from, honest, b, i, l, l, displaystyle, text, honest, bill, bill, is, honest, if, only, one, object, matching, the, description, exists, the, unique, existential, quantifier, displaystyle, exists, can, be, used, many, logical, systems, that, are, based, on, first, order, logic, also, follow, this, idea, free, logic, is, an, exception, because, it, allows, the, presence, of, empty, names, that, do, not, refer, to, an, object, in, the, domain, with, this, modification, it, is, possible, to, apply, logical, reasoning, to, fictional, objects, instead, of, limiting, it, to, regular, objects, in, free, logic, one, can, express, that, pegasus, is, a, flying, horse, using, the, formula, flyinghorse, p, e, g, a, s, u, s, displaystyle, text, flyinghorse, pegasus, as, a, consequence, of, this, modification, one, cannot, infer, from, this, type, of, statement, that, something, exists, this, means, the, inference, from, flyinghorse, p, e, g, a, s, u, s, displaystyle, text, flyinghorse, pegasus, to, x, flyinghorse, x, displaystyle, exists, x, text, flyinghorse, x, is, invalid, in, free, logic, even, though, it, is, valid, in, first, order, logic, free, logic, uses, an, additional, existence, predicate, e, displaystyle, e, to, say, a, singular, term, refers, to, an, existing, object, for, example, the, formula, e, h, o, m, e, r, displaystyle, e, homer, can, be, used, to, say, homer, exists, while, the, formula, e, p, e, g, a, s, u, s, displaystyle, lnot, e, pegasus, states, pegasus, does, not, exist, the, disciplines, of, epistemology, philosophy, of, mind, and, philosophy, of, language, deal, with, mental, and, linguistic, representations, in, their, attempt, to, understand, the, nature, of, knowledge, the, mind, and, language, this, brings, with, it, the, problem, of, reference, or, how, representations, can, refer, to, existing, objects, examples, of, such, representations, are, beliefs, thoughts, perceptions, words, and, sentences, for, instance, in, the, sentence, barack, obama, is, a, democrat, the, name, barack, obama, refers, to, a, particular, individual, the, problem, of, reference, also, affects, the, epistemology, of, perception, in, particular, this, concerns, the, problem, of, whether, perceptual, impressions, establish, a, direct, contact, with, reality, closely, related, to, the, problem, of, reference, is, the, relationship, between, true, representations, and, existence, according, to, truthmaker, theory, true, representations, require, a, truthmaker, i, e, an, entity, whose, existence, is, responsible, for, the, representation, being, true, for, example, the, sentence, kangaroos, live, in, australia, is, true, because, there, are, kangaroos, in, australia, the, existence, of, these, kangaroos, is, the, truthmaker, of, the, sentence, truthmaker, theory, states, there, is, a, close, relationship, between, truth, and, existence, there, exists, a, truthmaker, for, every, true, representation, many, of, the, individual, sciences, are, concerned, with, the, existence, of, particular, types, of, entities, and, the, laws, governing, them, such, as, physical, things, in, physics, and, living, entities, in, biology, the, natural, sciences, employ, a, great, variety, of, concepts, to, classify, entities, these, are, known, as, natural, kinds, and, include, categories, like, protons, gold, and, elephants, according, to, scientific, realists, these, entities, have, mind, independent, being, scientific, anti, realists, say, the, existence, of, these, entities, and, categories, is, based, on, human, perceptions, theories, and, social, constructs, a, similar, problem, concerns, the, existence, of, social, kinds, which, are, basic, concepts, used, in, the, social, sciences, such, as, race, gender, disability, money, and, nation, state, social, kinds, are, often, understood, as, social, constructions, that, while, useful, for, describing, the, complexities, of, human, social, life, do, not, form, part, of, objective, reality, on, the, most, fundamental, level, according, to, the, controversial, sapir, whorf, hypothesis, the, social, institution, of, language, influences, or, fully, determines, how, people, perceive, and, understand, the, world, existentialism, is, a, school, of, thought, that, explores, the, nature, of, human, existence, among, its, key, ideas, is, that, existence, precedes, essence, this, means, that, existence, is, more, basic, than, essence, as, a, result, the, nature, and, purpose, of, human, beings, are, not, pre, existing, but, develop, in, the, process, of, living, according, to, this, view, humans, are, thrown, into, a, world, that, lacks, pre, existing, intrinsic, meaning, they, must, determine, for, themselves, their, purpose, and, what, meaning, their, life, should, have, existentialists, use, this, idea, to, explore, the, role, of, freedom, and, responsibility, in, actively, shaping, one, s, life, feminist, existentialists, investigate, the, effects, of, gender, on, human, existence, for, example, on, the, experience, of, freedom, influential, existentialists, include, s, ren, kierkegaard, 1813, 1855, friedrich, nietzsche, 1844, 1900, jean, paul, sartre, 1905, 1980, and, simone, de, beauvoir, 1908, 1986, existentialism, has, influenced, reflections, on, the, role, of, human, existence, in, sociology, existentialist, sociology, examines, the, ways, humans, experience, the, social, world, and, construct, reality, existence, theory, is, a, relatively, recent, approach, that, focuses, on, the, temporal, aspect, of, existence, in, society, it, explores, how, the, existential, milestones, to, which, people, aspire, influence, their, lives, mathematicians, are, often, interested, in, the, existence, of, certain, mathematical, objects, for, example, number, theorists, ask, how, many, prime, numbers, exist, within, a, certain, interval, the, statement, that, at, least, one, mathematical, object, matching, a, certain, description, exists, is, called, an, existence, theorem, metaphysicians, of, mathematics, investigate, whether, mathematical, objects, exist, not, only, in, relation, to, mathematical, axioms, but, also, as, part, of, the, fundamental, structure, of, reality, this, position, is, affirmed, by, platonists, while, nominalists, believe, mathematical, objects, lack, a, more, substantial, form, of, existence, for, instance, because, they, are, merely, useful, fictions, many, debates, in, theology, revolve, around, the, existence, of, the, divine, and, arguments, have, been, presented, for, and, against, god, s, existence, cosmological, arguments, state, that, god, must, exist, as, the, first, cause, to, explain, facts, about, the, existence, and, aspects, of, the, universe, according, to, teleological, arguments, the, only, way, to, explain, the, order, and, complexity, of, the, universe, and, human, life, is, by, reference, to, god, as, the, intelligent, designer, an, influential, argument, against, the, existence, of, god, relies, on, the, problem, of, evil, since, it, is, not, clear, how, evil, could, exist, if, there, was, an, all, powerful, all, knowing, and, benevolent, god, another, argument, points, to, a, lack, of, concrete, evidence, for, god, s, existence
