experience, refers, to, conscious, events, in, general, more, specifically, to, perceptions, or, to, the, practical, knowledge, and, familiarity, that, is, produced, by, these, processes, understood, as, a, conscious, event, in, the, widest, sense, experience, involves, a, subject, to, which, various, items, are, presented, in, this, sense, seeing, a, yellow, bird, on, a, branch, presents, the, subject, with, the, objects, bird, and, branch, the, relation, between, them, and, the, property, yellow, unreal, items, may, be, included, as, well, which, happens, when, experiencing, hallucinations, or, dreams, when, understood, in, a, more, restricted, sense, only, sensory, consciousness, counts, as, experience, in, this, sense, experience, is, usually, identified, with, perception, and, contrasted, with, other, types, of, conscious, events, like, thinking, or, imagining, in, a, slightly, different, sense, experience, refers, not, to, the, conscious, events, themselves, but, to, the, practical, knowledge, and, familiarity, they, produce, hence, it, is, important, that, direct, perceptual, contact, with, the, external, world, is, the, source, of, knowledge, so, an, experienced, hiker, is, someone, who, has, actually, lived, through, many, hikes, not, someone, who, merely, read, many, books, about, hiking, this, is, associated, both, with, recurrent, past, acquaintance, and, the, abilities, learned, through, them, many, scholarly, debates, on, the, nature, of, experience, focus, on, experience, as, conscious, event, either, in, the, wide, or, the, more, restricted, sense, one, important, topic, in, this, field, is, the, question, of, whether, all, experiences, are, intentional, i, e, are, directed, at, objects, different, from, themselves, another, debate, focuses, on, the, question, of, whether, there, are, non, conceptual, experiences, and, if, so, what, role, they, could, play, in, justifying, beliefs, some, theorists, claim, that, experiences, are, transparent, meaning, that, what, an, experience, feels, like, only, depends, on, the, contents, presented, in, this, experience, other, theorists, reject, this, claim, by, pointing, out, that, what, matters, is, not, just, what, is, presented, but, also, how, it, is, presented, a, great, variety, of, types, of, experiences, is, discussed, in, the, academic, literature, perceptual, experiences, for, example, represent, the, external, world, through, stimuli, registered, and, transmitted, by, the, senses, the, experience, of, episodic, memory, on, the, other, hand, involves, reliving, a, past, event, one, experienced, before, in, imaginative, experience, objects, are, presented, without, aiming, to, show, how, things, actually, are, the, experience, of, thinking, involves, mental, representations, and, the, processing, of, information, in, which, ideas, or, propositions, are, entertained, judged, or, connected, pleasure, refers, to, experience, that, feels, good, it, is, closely, related, to, emotional, experience, which, has, additionally, evaluative, physiological, and, behavioral, components, moods, are, similar, to, emotions, with, one, key, difference, being, that, they, lack, a, specific, object, found, in, emotions, conscious, desires, involve, the, experience, of, wanting, something, they, play, a, central, role, in, the, experience, of, agency, in, which, intentions, are, formed, courses, of, action, are, planned, and, decisions, are, taken, and, realized, non, ordinary, experience, refers, to, rare, experiences, that, significantly, differ, from, the, experience, in, the, ordinary, waking, state, like, religious, experiences, out, of, body, experiences, or, near, death, experiences, experience, is, discussed, in, various, disciplines, phenomenology, is, the, science, of, the, structure, and, contents, of, experience, it, uses, different, methods, like, epoch, or, eidetic, variation, sensory, experience, is, of, special, interest, to, epistemology, an, important, traditional, discussion, in, this, field, concerns, whether, all, knowledge, is, based, on, sensory, experience, as, empiricists, claim, or, not, as, rationalists, contend, this, is, closely, related, to, the, role, of, experience, in, science, in, which, experience, is, said, to, act, as, a, neutral, arbiter, between, competing, theories, in, metaphysics, experience, is, involved, in, the, mind, body, problem, and, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, both, of, which, try, to, explain, the, relation, between, matter, and, experience, in, psychology, some, theorists, hold, that, all, concepts, are, learned, from, experience, while, others, argue, that, some, concepts, are, innate, according, to, the, merriam, webster, dictionary, the, definition, of, the, term, experience, can, be, stated, as, a, direct, observation, of, or, participation, in, events, as, a, basis, of, knowledge, the, term, experience, is, associated, with, a, variety, of, closely, related, meanings, which, is, why, various, different, definitions, of, it, are, found, in, the, academic, literature, experience, is, often, understood, as, a, conscious, event, this, is, sometimes, restricted, to, certain, types, of, consciousness, like, perception, or, sensation, through, which, the, subject, attains, knowledge, of, the, world, but, in, a, wider, sense, experience, includes, other, types, of, conscious, events, besides, perception, and, sensation, this, is, the, case, for, example, for, the, experience, of, thinking, or, the, experience, of, dreaming, in, a, different, sense, experience, refers, not, to, conscious, events, themselves, but, to, the, knowledge, and, practical, familiarity, they, bring, with, them, according, to, this, meaning, a, person, with, job, experience, or, an, experienced, hiker, is, someone, who, has, a, good, practical, familiarity, in, the, respective, field, in, this, sense, experience, refers, not, to, a, conscious, process, but, to, the, result, of, this, process, the, word, experience, shares, a, common, latin, root, with, the, word, experimentation, experience, is, often, understood, as, a, conscious, event, in, the, widest, sense, this, includes, various, types, of, experiences, such, as, perception, bodily, awareness, memory, imagination, emotion, desire, action, and, thought, it, usually, refers, to, the, experience, a, particular, individual, has, but, it, can, also, take, the, meaning, of, the, experience, had, by, a, group, of, individuals, for, example, of, a, nation, of, a, social, class, or, during, a, particular, historical, epoch, phenomenology, is, the, discipline, that, studies, the, subjective, structures, of, experience, i, e, what, it, is, like, from, the, first, person, perspective, to, experience, different, conscious, events, when, someone, has, an, experience, they, are, presented, with, various, items, these, items, may, belong, to, diverse, ontological, categories, corresponding, e, g, to, objects, properties, relations, or, events, seeing, a, yellow, bird, on, a, branch, for, example, presents, the, subject, with, the, objects, bird, and, branch, the, relation, between, them, and, the, property, yellow, these, items, can, include, both, familiar, and, unfamiliar, items, which, means, that, it, is, possible, to, experience, something, without, fully, understanding, it, when, understood, in, its, widest, sense, the, items, present, in, experience, can, include, unreal, items, this, is, the, case, for, example, when, experiencing, illusions, hallucinations, or, dreams, in, this, sense, one, can, have, the, experience, of, a, yellow, bird, on, a, branch, even, though, there, is, no, yellow, bird, on, the, branch, experiences, may, include, only, real, items, only, unreal, items, or, a, mix, between, the, two, phenomenologists, have, made, various, suggestions, about, what, the, basic, features, of, experience, are, the, suggested, features, include, spatial, temporal, awareness, the, difference, in, attention, between, foreground, and, background, the, subject, s, awareness, of, itself, the, sense, of, agency, and, purpose, bodily, awareness, and, awareness, of, other, people, when, understood, in, a, more, restricted, sense, only, sensory, consciousness, counts, as, experience, in, this, sense, it, is, possible, to, experience, something, without, understanding, what, it, is, this, would, be, the, case, for, example, if, someone, experienced, a, robbery, without, being, aware, of, what, exactly, was, happening, in, this, case, the, sensations, caused, by, the, robbery, constitute, the, experience, of, the, robbery, this, characterization, excludes, more, abstract, types, of, consciousness, from, experience, in, this, sense, it, is, sometimes, held, that, experience, and, thought, are, two, separate, aspects, of, mental, life, a, similar, distinction, is, sometimes, drawn, between, experience, and, theory, but, these, views, are, not, generally, accepted, critics, often, point, out, that, experience, involves, various, cognitive, components, that, cannot, be, reduced, to, sensory, consciousness, another, approach, is, to, distinguish, between, internal, and, external, experience, so, while, sensory, perception, belongs, to, external, experience, there, may, also, be, other, types, of, experience, like, remembering, or, imagining, which, belong, to, internal, experience, in, another, sense, experience, refers, not, to, the, conscious, events, themselves, but, to, the, knowledge, they, produce, for, this, sense, it, is, important, that, the, knowledge, comes, about, through, direct, perceptual, contact, with, the, external, world, that, the, knowledge, is, direct, means, that, it, was, obtained, through, immediate, observation, i, e, without, involving, any, inference, one, may, obtain, all, kinds, of, knowledge, indirectly, for, example, by, reading, books, or, watching, movies, about, the, topic, this, type, of, knowledge, does, not, constitute, experience, of, the, topic, since, the, direct, contact, in, question, concerns, only, the, books, and, movies, but, not, the, topic, itself, the, objects, of, this, knowledge, are, often, understood, as, public, objects, which, are, open, to, observation, by, most, regular, people, the, meaning, of, the, term, experience, in, everyday, language, usually, sees, the, knowledge, in, question, not, merely, as, theoretical, know, that, or, descriptive, knowledge, instead, it, includes, some, form, of, practical, know, how, i, e, familiarity, with, a, certain, practical, matter, this, familiarity, rests, on, recurrent, past, acquaintance, or, performances, it, often, involves, having, learned, something, by, heart, and, being, able, to, skillfully, practice, it, rather, than, having, a, mere, theoretical, understanding, but, the, knowledge, and, skills, obtained, directly, this, way, are, normally, limited, to, generalized, rules, of, thumb, as, such, they, lack, behind, the, scientific, certainty, that, comes, about, through, a, methodological, analysis, by, scientists, that, condenses, the, corresponding, insights, into, laws, of, nature, most, experiences, especially, the, ones, of, the, perceptual, kind, aim, at, representing, reality, this, is, usually, expressed, by, stating, that, they, have, intentionality, or, are, about, their, intentional, object, if, they, are, successful, or, veridical, they, represent, the, world, as, it, actually, is, but, they, may, also, fail, in, which, case, they, give, a, false, representation, it, is, traditionally, held, that, all, experience, is, intentional, this, thesis, is, known, as, intentionalism, in, this, context, it, is, often, claimed, that, all, mental, states, not, just, experiences, are, intentional, but, special, prominence, is, usually, given, to, experiences, in, these, debates, since, they, seem, to, constitute, the, most, fundamental, form, of, intentionality, it, is, commonly, accepted, that, all, experiences, have, phenomenal, features, i, e, that, there, is, something, it, is, like, to, live, through, them, opponents, of, intentionalism, claim, that, not, all, experiences, have, intentional, features, i, e, that, phenomenal, features, and, intentional, features, can, come, apart, some, alleged, counterexamples, to, intentionalism, involve, pure, sensory, experiences, like, pain, of, which, it, is, claimed, that, they, lack, representational, components, defenders, of, intentionalism, have, often, responded, by, claiming, that, these, states, have, intentional, aspects, after, all, for, example, that, pain, represents, bodily, damage, mystical, states, of, experience, constitute, another, putative, counterexample, in, this, context, it, is, claimed, that, it, is, possible, to, have, experiences, of, pure, consciousness, in, which, awareness, still, exists, but, lacks, any, object, but, evaluating, this, claim, is, difficult, since, such, experiences, are, seen, as, extremely, rare, and, therefore, difficult, to, investigate, another, debate, concerns, the, question, of, whether, all, experiences, have, conceptual, contents, concepts, are, general, notions, that, constitute, the, fundamental, building, blocks, of, thought, conceptual, contents, are, usually, contrasted, with, sensory, contents, like, seeing, colors, or, hearing, noises, this, discussion, is, especially, relevant, for, perceptual, experience, of, which, some, empiricists, claim, that, it, is, made, up, only, of, sense, data, without, any, conceptual, contents, the, view, that, such, a, type, of, experience, exists, and, plays, an, important, role, in, epistemological, issues, has, been, termed, the, myth, of, the, given, by, its, opponents, the, given, refers, to, the, immediate, uninterpreted, sensory, contents, of, such, experiences, underlying, this, discussion, is, the, distinction, between, a, bare, or, immediate, experience, in, contrast, to, a, more, developed, experience, the, idea, behind, this, distinction, is, that, some, aspects, of, experience, are, directly, given, to, the, subject, without, any, interpretation, these, basic, aspects, are, then, interpreted, in, various, ways, leading, to, a, more, reflective, and, conceptually, rich, experience, showing, various, new, relations, between, the, basic, elements, this, distinction, could, explain, for, example, how, various, faulty, perceptions, like, perceptual, illusions, arise, they, are, due, to, false, interpretations, inferences, or, constructions, by, the, subject, but, are, not, found, on, the, most, basic, level, in, this, sense, it, is, often, remarked, that, experience, is, a, product, both, of, the, world, and, of, the, subject, the, distinction, between, immediate, and, interpreted, aspects, of, experience, has, proven, contentious, in, philosophy, with, some, critics, claiming, that, there, is, no, immediate, given, within, experience, i, e, that, everything, is, interpreted, in, some, way, one, problem, with, this, criticism, is, that, it, is, difficult, to, see, how, any, interpretation, could, get, started, if, there, was, nothing, there, to, be, interpreted, to, begin, with, among, those, who, accept, that, there, is, some, form, of, immediate, experience, there, are, different, theories, concerning, its, nature, sense, datum, theorists, for, example, hold, that, immediate, experience, only, consists, of, basic, sensations, like, colors, shapes, or, noises, this, immediate, given, is, by, itself, a, chaotic, undifferentiated, mass, that, is, then, ordered, through, various, mental, processes, like, association, memory, and, language, into, the, normal, everyday, objects, we, perceive, like, trees, cars, or, spoons, direct, realists, on, the, other, hand, hold, that, these, material, everyday, objects, themselves, are, the, immediate, given, some, philosophers, have, tried, to, approach, these, disagreements, by, formulating, general, characteristics, possessed, by, the, contents, of, immediate, experience, or, the, given, it, is, often, held, that, they, are, private, sensory, simple, and, incorrigible, privacy, refers, to, the, idea, that, the, experience, belongs, to, the, subject, experiencing, it, and, is, not, directly, accessible, to, other, subjects, this, access, is, at, best, indirect, for, example, when, the, experiencer, tells, others, about, their, experience, simplicity, means, in, this, context, that, what, is, given, constitutes, basic, building, blocks, free, from, any, additional, interpretations, or, inferences, the, idea, that, the, given, is, incorrigible, has, been, important, in, many, traditional, disputes, in, epistemology, it, is, the, idea, that, we, cannot, be, wrong, about, certain, aspects, of, our, experience, on, this, view, the, subject, may, be, wrong, about, inferences, drawn, from, the, experience, about, external, reality, for, example, that, there, is, a, green, tree, outside, the, window, but, it, cannot, be, wrong, about, certain, more, fundamental, aspects, of, how, things, seem, to, us, for, example, that, the, subject, is, presented, with, a, green, shape, critics, of, this, view, have, argued, that, we, may, be, wrong, even, about, how, things, seem, to, us, e, g, that, a, possibly, wrong, conceptualization, may, already, happen, on, the, most, basic, level, there, is, disagreement, among, theorists, of, experience, concerning, whether, the, subjective, character, of, an, experience, is, entirely, determined, by, its, contents, this, claim, has, been, called, the, transparency, of, experience, it, states, that, what, it, is, like, to, undergo, an, experience, only, depends, on, the, items, presented, in, it, this, would, mean, that, two, experiences, are, exactly, alike, if, they, have, the, same, contents, various, philosophers, have, rejected, this, thesis, often, with, the, argument, that, what, matters, is, not, just, what, is, presented, but, also, how, it, is, presented, for, example, the, property, of, roundness, can, be, presented, visually, when, looking, at, a, sphere, or, haptically, when, touching, the, sphere, defenders, of, the, transparency, thesis, have, pointed, out, that, the, difference, between, the, experiences, in, such, examples, can, be, explained, on, the, level, of, content, one, experience, presents, the, property, of, visual, roundness, while, the, other, presents, felt, roundness, other, counterexamples, include, blurry, vision, where, the, blurriness, is, seen, as, a, flawed, representation, without, presenting, the, seen, object, itself, as, blurry, it, has, been, argued, that, only, the, universals, present, in, the, experience, determine, the, subjective, character, of, the, experience, on, this, view, two, experiences, involving, different, particulars, that, instantiate, exactly, the, same, universals, would, be, subjectively, identical, perceptual, experience, refers, to, an, immediate, consciousness, of, the, existence, of, things, outside, us, this, representation, of, the, external, world, happens, through, stimuli, registered, and, transmitted, by, the, senses, perceptual, experience, occurs, in, different, modalities, corresponding, to, the, different, senses, e, g, as, visual, perception, auditory, perception, or, haptic, perception, it, is, usually, held, that, the, objects, perceived, this, way, are, ordinary, material, objects, like, stones, flowers, cats, or, airplanes, that, are, presented, as, public, objects, existing, independent, of, the, mind, perceiving, them, this, stands, in, contrast, for, example, to, how, objects, are, presented, in, imaginative, experience, another, feature, commonly, ascribed, to, perceptual, experience, is, that, it, seems, to, put, us, into, direct, touch, with, the, object, it, presents, so, the, perceiver, is, normally, not, aware, of, the, cognitive, processes, starting, with, the, stimulation, of, the, sense, organs, continuing, in, the, transmission, of, this, information, to, the, brain, and, ending, in, the, information, processing, happening, there, while, perception, is, usually, a, reliable, source, of, information, for, the, practical, matters, of, our, everyday, affairs, it, can, also, include, false, information, in, the, form, of, illusion, and, hallucination, in, some, cases, the, unreliability, of, a, perception, is, already, indicated, within, the, experience, itself, for, example, when, the, perceiver, fails, to, identify, an, object, due, to, blurry, vision, but, such, indications, are, not, found, in, all, misleading, experiences, which, may, appear, just, as, reliable, as, their, accurate, counterparts, this, is, the, source, of, the, so, called, problem, of, perception, it, consists, in, the, fact, that, the, features, ascribed, to, perception, so, far, seem, to, be, incompatible, with, each, other, making, the, so, characterized, perception, impossible, in, the, case, of, misleading, perceptions, the, perceiver, may, be, presented, with, objects, that, do, not, exist, which, would, be, impossible, if, they, were, in, direct, touch, with, the, presented, objects, different, solutions, to, this, problem, have, been, suggested, sense, datum, theories, for, example, hold, that, we, perceive, sense, data, like, patches, of, color, in, visual, perception, which, do, exist, even, in, illusions, they, thereby, deny, that, ordinary, material, things, are, the, objects, of, perception, disjunctivists, on, the, other, hand, try, to, solve, the, problem, by, denying, that, veridical, perceptions, and, illusions, belong, to, the, same, kind, of, experience, other, approaches, include, adverbialism, and, intentionalism, the, problem, with, these, different, approaches, is, that, neither, of, them, is, fully, satisfying, since, each, one, seems, to, contradict, some, kind, of, introspective, evidence, concerning, the, fundamental, features, of, perceptual, experience, the, experience, of, episodic, memory, consists, in, a, form, of, reliving, a, past, event, one, experienced, before, this, is, different, from, semantic, memory, in, which, one, has, access, to, the, knowledge, of, various, facts, concerning, the, event, in, question, without, any, experiential, component, associated, with, this, knowledge, in, episodic, memory, on, the, other, hand, the, past, event, is, consciously, re, experienced, in, this, sense, it, is, a, form, of, mental, time, travel, that, is, not, present, in, non, episodic, memory, but, this, re, experiencing, is, not, an, exact, copy, of, the, original, experience, since, the, experienced, event, is, presented, as, something, in, the, past, seen, from, one, s, current, perspective, which, is, associated, with, some, kind, of, feeling, of, pastness, or, familiarity, not, present, in, the, original, experience, in, this, context, it, is, often, held, that, episodic, memory, provides, two, types, of, information, first, order, information, about, the, past, event, and, second, order, information, about, the, role, of, this, event, in, the, subject, s, current, memory, episodic, memory, is, different, from, merely, imagining, the, experience, of, a, past, event, an, important, aspect, of, this, difference, is, that, it, is, part, of, the, nature, of, episodic, memory, to, try, to, represent, how, the, original, experience, was, even, if, it, sometimes, fails, to, do, so, other, suggested, differences, include, the, degree, of, vividness, and, the, causal, connection, between, the, original, experience, and, the, episodic, memory, imaginative, experience, involves, a, special, form, of, representation, in, which, objects, are, presented, without, aiming, to, show, how, things, actually, are, like, memory, and, unlike, perception, the, associated, mental, images, are, normally, not, caused, by, the, stimulation, of, sensory, organs, it, is, often, held, that, both, imagination, and, memory, depend, on, previous, perceptual, acquaintance, with, the, experienced, contents, but, unlike, memory, more, freedom, is, involved, in, most, forms, of, imagination, since, the, subject, can, freely, vary, change, and, recombine, various, of, the, experienced, contents, while, memory, aims, to, preserve, their, original, order, different, theorists, focus, on, different, elements, when, trying, to, conceptualize, the, nature, of, imagination, the, impoverishment, view, holds, that, imagination, is, distinguished, from, perception, and, memory, by, being, less, vivid, and, clear, the, will, dependence, view, on, the, other, hand, centers, on, the, power, of, the, will, to, actively, shape, the, contents, of, imagination, whereas, the, nonexistence, view, focuses, on, the, impression, of, unreality, or, distance, from, reality, belonging, to, imaginative, experience, despite, its, freedom, and, its, lack, of, relation, to, actuality, imaginative, experience, can, serve, certain, epistemological, functions, by, representing, what, is, possible, or, conceivable, this, is, the, case, for, example, when, imaginatively, speculating, about, an, event, that, has, happened, or, might, happen, imagination, can, happen, in, various, different, forms, one, difference, concerns, whether, the, imagined, scenario, is, deliberately, controlled, or, arises, spontaneously, by, itself, another, concerns, whether, the, subject, imagines, itself, as, experiencing, the, imagined, event, from, the, inside, as, being, one, of, the, protagonists, within, this, event, or, from, the, outside, different, imaginative, experiences, tend, to, have, different, degrees, to, which, the, imagined, scenario, is, just, a, reconstruction, of, something, experienced, previously, or, a, creative, rearrangement, accounts, of, imaginative, experience, usually, focus, on, the, visual, domain, but, there, are, also, other, less, prominent, forms, like, auditory, imagination, or, olfactory, imagination, the, term, thinking, is, used, to, refer, to, a, wide, variety, of, cognitive, experiences, they, involve, mental, representations, and, the, processing, of, information, this, way, ideas, or, propositions, are, entertained, judged, or, connected, it, is, similar, to, memory, and, imagination, in, that, the, experience, of, thinking, can, arise, internally, without, any, stimulation, of, the, sensory, organs, in, contrast, to, perception, but, thinking, is, still, further, removed, from, sensory, contents, than, memory, and, imagination, since, its, contents, belong, to, a, more, abstract, level, it, is, closely, related, to, the, phenomenon, of, speech, with, some, theorists, claiming, that, all, thinking, is, a, form, of, inner, speech, expressed, in, language, but, this, claim, is, controversial, since, there, seem, to, be, thoughts, that, are, not, linguistically, fully, articulated, but, the, more, moderate, claim, is, often, accepted, that, thinking, is, associated, with, dispositions, to, perform, speech, acts, on, this, view, making, a, judgment, in, thought, may, happen, non, linguistically, but, is, associated, with, a, disposition, to, linguistically, affirm, the, judged, proposition, various, theories, of, the, nature, of, the, experience, of, thinking, have, been, proposed, according, to, platonism, it, is, a, spiritual, activity, in, which, platonic, forms, and, their, interrelations, are, discerned, and, inspected, conceptualists, on, the, other, hand, hold, that, thinking, involves, entertaining, concepts, on, this, view, judgments, arise, if, two, or, more, concepts, are, connected, to, each, other, and, can, further, lead, to, inferences, if, these, judgments, are, connected, to, other, judgments, various, types, of, thinking, are, discussed, in, the, academic, literature, they, are, sometimes, divided, into, four, categories, concept, formation, problem, solving, judgment, and, decision, making, and, reasoning, in, concept, formation, the, features, common, to, the, examples, of, a, certain, type, are, learned, this, usually, corresponds, to, understanding, the, meaning, of, the, word, associated, with, this, type, in, the, case, of, problem, solving, thinking, has, as, its, goal, to, overcome, certain, obstacles, by, discovering, a, solution, to, a, problem, this, happens, either, by, following, an, algorithm, which, guarantees, success, if, followed, correctly, or, by, using, heuristics, which, are, more, informal, methods, that, tend, to, bring, the, thinker, closer, to, a, solution, judgment, and, decision, making, involve, choosing, the, best, course, of, action, among, various, alternatives, in, reasoning, the, thinker, starts, from, a, certain, set, of, premises, and, tries, to, draw, conclusions, from, them, a, simpler, categorization, divides, thinking, into, only, two, categories, theoretical, contemplation, and, practical, deliberation, pleasure, refers, to, experience, that, feels, good, it, involves, the, enjoyment, of, something, like, eating, a, cake, or, having, sex, when, understood, in, the, widest, sense, this, includes, not, just, sensory, pleasures, but, any, form, of, pleasant, experience, such, as, engaging, in, an, intellectually, satisfying, activity, or, the, joy, of, playing, a, game, pleasure, comes, in, degrees, and, exists, in, a, dimension, that, includes, negative, degrees, as, well, these, negative, degrees, are, usually, referred, to, as, pain, and, suffering, and, stand, in, contrast, to, pleasure, as, forms, of, feeling, bad, discussions, of, this, dimension, often, focus, on, its, positive, side, but, many, of, the, theories, and, insights, apply, equally, to, its, negative, side, there, is, disagreement, among, philosophers, and, psychologists, concerning, what, the, nature, of, pleasure, is, some, understand, pleasure, as, a, simple, sensation, on, this, view, a, pleasure, experience, is, an, experience, that, has, a, pleasure, sensation, among, its, contents, this, account, is, rejected, by, attitude, theories, which, hold, that, pleasure, consists, not, in, a, content, but, in, a, certain, attitude, towards, a, content, according, to, this, perspective, the, pleasure, of, eating, a, cake, consists, not, in, a, taste, sensation, together, with, a, pleasure, sensation, as, sensation, theorists, claim, instead, it, consists, in, having, a, certain, attitude, like, desire, towards, the, taste, sensation, a, third, type, of, theory, defines, pleasure, in, terms, of, its, representational, properties, on, this, view, an, experience, is, pleasurable, if, it, presents, its, objects, as, being, good, for, the, experiencer, emotional, experiences, come, in, many, forms, like, fear, anger, excitement, surprise, grief, or, disgust, they, usually, include, either, pleasurable, or, unpleasurable, aspects, but, they, normally, involve, various, other, components, as, well, which, are, not, present, in, every, experience, of, pleasure, or, pain, it, is, often, held, that, they, also, comprise, evaluative, components, which, ascribe, a, positive, or, negative, value, to, their, object, physiological, components, which, involve, bodily, changes, and, behavioral, components, in, the, form, of, a, reaction, to, the, presented, object, for, example, suddenly, encountering, a, grizzly, bear, while, hiking, may, evoke, an, emotional, experience, of, fear, in, the, hiker, which, is, experienced, as, unpleasant, which, represents, the, bear, as, dangerous, which, leads, to, an, increase, in, the, heart, rate, and, which, may, provoke, a, fleeing, reaction, these, and, other, types, of, components, are, often, used, to, categorize, emotions, into, different, types, but, there, is, disagreement, concerning, which, of, them, is, the, essential, component, determining, the, relevant, category, the, dominant, approaches, categorize, according, to, how, the, emotion, feels, how, it, evaluates, its, object, or, what, behavior, it, motivates, while, the, experience, of, positive, emotions, is, to, some, extent, its, own, justification, and, it, is, by, these, experiences, or, the, desire, for, them, that, individuals, tend, to, be, motivated, the, experience, of, negative, emotions, is, sometimes, claimed, to, cause, personal, growth, and, hence, to, be, either, necessary, for, or, at, least, beneficial, in, creating, more, productive, and, resilient, people, though, the, necessity, of, resilience, in, the, first, place, or, of, negative, experiences, in, re, growth, has, been, questioned, by, others, moods, are, closely, related, to, emotions, but, not, identical, to, them, like, emotions, they, can, usually, be, categorized, as, either, positive, or, negative, depending, on, how, it, feels, to, have, them, one, core, difference, is, that, emotional, experiences, usually, have, a, very, specific, object, like, the, fear, of, a, bear, mood, experiences, on, the, other, hand, often, either, have, no, object, or, their, object, is, rather, diffuse, like, when, a, person, is, anxious, that, something, bad, might, happen, without, being, able, to, clearly, articulate, the, source, of, their, anxiety, other, differences, include, that, emotions, tend, to, be, caused, by, specific, events, whereas, moods, often, lack, a, clearly, identifiable, cause, and, that, emotions, are, usually, intensive, whereas, moods, tend, to, last, longer, examples, of, moods, include, anxiety, depression, euphoria, irritability, melancholy, and, giddiness, desires, comprise, a, wide, class, of, mental, states, they, include, unconscious, desires, but, only, their, conscious, forms, are, directly, relevant, to, experience, conscious, desires, involve, the, experience, of, wanting, or, wishing, something, this, is, often, understood, in, a, very, wide, sense, in, which, phenomena, like, love, intention, and, thirst, are, seen, as, forms, of, desire, they, are, usually, understood, as, attitudes, toward, conceivable, states, of, affairs, they, represent, their, objects, as, being, valuable, in, some, sense, and, aim, to, realize, them, by, changing, the, world, correspondingly, this, can, either, happen, in, a, positive, or, a, negative, sense, in, the, positive, sense, the, object, is, experienced, as, good, and, the, aim, is, to, create, or, maintain, it, in, the, negative, sense, the, object, is, experienced, as, bad, and, the, aim, is, to, destroy, it, or, to, hinder, it, from, coming, into, existence, in, intrinsic, desires, the, object, is, desired, for, its, own, sake, whereas, in, extrinsic, desires, the, object, is, desired, because, of, the, positive, consequences, associated, with, it, desires, come, in, different, degrees, of, intensity, and, their, satisfaction, is, usually, experienced, as, pleasurable, agency, refers, to, the, capacity, to, act, and, the, manifestation, of, this, capacity, its, experience, involves, various, different, aspects, including, the, formation, of, intentions, when, planning, possible, courses, of, action, the, decision, between, different, alternatives, and, the, effort, when, trying, to, realize, the, intended, course, of, action, it, is, often, held, that, desires, provide, the, motivational, force, behind, agency, but, not, all, experiences, of, desire, are, accompanied, by, the, experience, of, agency, this, is, the, case, for, example, when, a, desire, is, fulfilled, without, the, agent, trying, to, do, so, or, when, no, possible, course, of, action, is, available, to, the, agent, to, fulfill, the, desire, in, a, more, restricted, sense, the, term, sense, of, agency, refers, to, the, impression, of, being, in, control, and, being, the, owner, of, one, s, action, it, is, often, held, that, two, components, are, the, central, sources, of, the, sense, of, agency, on, the, one, hand, the, agent, constantly, makes, predictions, about, how, their, intentions, will, influence, their, bodily, movement, and, compares, these, predictions, to, the, sensory, feedback, on, this, view, a, positive, match, generates, a, sense, of, agency, while, a, negative, match, disrupts, the, sense, of, agency, on, the, other, hand, when, looking, backward, the, agent, interprets, their, intention, as, the, cause, of, the, action, in, the, successful, case, the, intention, precedes, the, action, and, the, action, is, consistent, with, the, intention, the, terms, non, ordinary, experience, anomalous, experience, or, altered, state, of, consciousness, are, used, to, describe, a, wide, variety, of, rare, experiences, that, significantly, differ, from, the, experience, in, the, ordinary, waking, state, examples, of, non, ordinary, experiences, are, religious, experiences, which, are, closely, related, to, spiritual, or, mystical, experiences, out, of, body, experiences, near, death, experiences, psychotic, episodes, and, psychedelic, experiences, religious, experiences, are, non, ordinary, experiences, that, carry, religious, significance, for, the, experiencer, they, often, involve, some, kind, of, encounter, with, a, divine, person, for, example, in, the, form, of, seeing, god, or, hearing, god, s, command, but, they, can, also, involve, having, an, intensive, feeling, one, believes, to, be, caused, by, god, or, recognizing, the, divine, in, nature, or, in, oneself, some, religious, experiences, are, said, to, be, ineffable, meaning, that, they, are, so, far, away, from, the, ordinary, that, they, cannot, be, described, in, words, out, of, body, experiences, involve, the, impression, of, being, detached, from, one, s, material, body, and, perceiving, the, external, world, from, this, different, perspective, in, them, it, often, seems, to, the, person, that, they, are, floating, above, their, own, body, while, seeing, it, from, the, outside, they, can, have, various, different, causes, including, traumatic, brain, injuries, psychedelic, drugs, or, sleep, paralysis, they, can, also, take, the, form, of, near, death, experiences, which, are, usually, provoked, by, life, threatening, situations, and, include, contents, such, as, flying, through, a, tunnel, towards, a, light, talking, to, deceased, relatives, or, a, life, review, in, which, a, person, sees, their, whole, life, flash, before, their, eyes, it, is, uncontroversial, that, these, experiences, occur, sometimes, for, some, people, in, one, study, for, example, about, 10, report, having, had, at, least, one, out, of, body, experience, in, their, life, but, it, is, highly, controversial, how, reliable, these, experiences, are, at, accurately, representing, aspects, of, reality, not, accessible, to, ordinary, experience, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, various, wide, reaching, claims, are, made, based, on, non, ordinary, experiences, many, of, these, claims, cannot, be, verified, by, regular, perception, and, frequently, seem, to, contradict, it, or, each, other, based, on, religious, experience, for, example, it, has, been, claimed, that, a, divine, creator, distinct, from, nature, exists, or, that, the, divine, exists, in, nature, out, of, body, experiences, and, near, death, experiences, on, the, other, hand, are, often, used, to, argue, for, a, mind, body, dualism, by, holding, that, the, soul, can, exist, without, the, body, and, continues, to, exist, after, the, death, of, the, body, defenders, of, such, claims, often, contend, that, we, have, no, decisive, reason, to, deny, the, reliability, of, such, experiences, for, example, because, they, are, in, important, ways, similar, to, regular, sensory, experience, or, because, there, is, an, additional, cognitive, faculty, that, provides, us, access, to, knowledge, beyond, the, regular, senses, a, great, variety, of, experiences, is, discussed, in, the, academic, literature, besides, the, types, mentioned, so, far, the, term, flow, for, example, refers, to, experiences, in, which, the, agent, is, fully, immersed, in, a, certain, activity, this, type, of, experience, has, various, characteristic, features, including, a, clear, sense, of, the, activity, s, goal, immediate, feedback, on, how, one, is, doing, and, a, good, balance, between, one, s, skills, and, the, difficulty, of, the, task, a, diverse, group, of, activities, can, lead, to, flow, experiences, like, art, sports, and, computer, games, flow, is, of, particular, interest, to, positive, psychology, because, its, experience, is, pleasurable, aesthetic, experience, is, a, central, concept, in, the, psychology, of, art, and, experimental, aesthetics, it, refers, to, the, experience, of, aesthetic, objects, in, particular, concerning, beauty, and, art, there, is, no, general, agreement, on, the, fundamental, features, common, to, all, aesthetic, experiences, some, accounts, focus, on, features, like, a, fascination, with, an, aesthetic, object, a, feeling, of, unity, and, intensity, whereas, others, emphasize, a, certain, psychological, distance, from, the, aesthetic, object, in, the, sense, that, the, aesthetic, experience, is, disconnected, from, practical, concerns, transformative, experiences, are, experiences, involving, a, radical, transformation, that, leaves, the, experiencer, a, different, person, from, who, they, were, before, examples, of, transformative, experiences, include, having, a, child, fighting, in, a, war, or, undergoing, a, religious, conversion, they, involve, fundamental, changes, both, in, one, s, beliefs, and, in, one, s, core, preferences, it, has, been, argued, that, transformative, experiences, constitute, counterexamples, to, rational, choice, theory, because, the, person, deciding, for, or, against, undergoing, a, transformative, experience, cannot, know, what, it, will, be, like, until, afterward, it, also, may, be, because, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, decision, should, be, grounded, in, the, preferences, before, or, after, the, transformation, phenomenology, is, the, science, of, the, structure, and, contents, of, experience, it, studies, phenomena, i, e, the, appearances, of, things, from, the, first, person, perspective, a, great, variety, of, experiences, is, investigated, this, way, including, perception, memory, imagination, thought, desire, emotion, and, agency, according, to, traditional, phenomenology, one, important, structure, found, in, all, the, different, types, of, experience, is, intentionality, meaning, that, all, experience, is, experience, of, something, in, this, sense, experience, is, always, directed, at, certain, objects, by, means, of, its, representational, contents, experiences, are, in, an, important, sense, different, from, the, objects, of, experience, since, experiences, are, not, just, presented, but, one, lives, through, them, phenomenology, is, also, concerned, with, the, study, of, the, conditions, of, possibility, of, phenomena, that, may, shape, experience, differently, for, different, people, these, conditions, include, embodiment, culture, language, and, social, background, there, are, various, different, forms, of, phenomenology, which, employ, different, methods, central, to, traditional, phenomenology, associated, with, edmund, husserl, is, the, so, called, epoch, also, referred, to, as, bracketing, in, it, the, researcher, suspends, their, judgment, about, the, external, existence, of, the, experienced, objects, in, order, to, focus, exclusively, on, the, structure, of, the, experience, itself, i, e, on, how, these, objects, are, presented, an, important, method, for, studying, the, contents, of, experience, is, called, eidetic, variation, it, aims, at, discerning, their, essence, by, imagining, the, object, in, question, varying, its, features, and, assessing, whether, the, object, can, survive, this, imaginary, change, only, features, that, cannot, be, changed, this, way, belong, to, the, object, s, essence, hermeneutic, phenomenology, by, contrast, gives, more, importance, to, our, pre, existing, familiarity, with, experience, it, tries, to, comprehend, how, this, pre, understanding, brings, with, it, various, forms, of, interpretation, that, shape, experience, and, may, introduce, distortions, into, it, neurophenomenology, on, the, other, hand, aims, at, bridging, the, gap, between, the, first, person, perspective, of, traditional, phenomenology, and, the, third, person, approach, favored, by, the, natural, sciences, this, happens, by, looking, for, connections, between, subjective, experience, and, objective, brain, processes, for, example, with, the, help, of, brain, scans, experience, when, understood, in, terms, of, sensation, is, of, special, interest, to, epistemology, knowledge, based, on, this, form, of, experience, is, termed, empirical, knowledge, or, knowledge, a, posteriori, empiricism, is, the, thesis, that, all, knowledge, is, empirical, knowledge, i, e, that, there, is, no, knowledge, that, does, not, ultimately, rest, on, sensory, experience, traditionally, this, view, is, opposed, by, rationalists, who, accept, that, sensory, experience, can, ground, knowledge, but, also, allow, other, sources, of, knowledge, for, example, some, rationalists, claim, that, humans, either, have, innate, or, intuitive, knowledge, of, mathematics, that, does, not, rest, on, generalizations, based, on, sensory, experiences, another, problem, is, to, understand, how, it, is, possible, for, sensory, experiences, to, justify, beliefs, according, to, one, view, sensory, experiences, are, themselves, belief, like, in, the, sense, that, they, involve, the, affirmation, of, propositional, contents, on, this, view, seeing, white, snow, involves, among, other, things, the, affirmation, of, the, proposition, snow, is, white, given, this, assumption, experiences, can, justify, beliefs, in, the, same, way, as, beliefs, can, justify, other, beliefs, because, their, propositional, contents, stand, in, the, appropriate, logical, and, explanatory, relations, to, each, other, but, this, assumption, has, many, opponents, who, argue, that, sensations, are, non, conceptual, and, therefore, non, propositional, on, such, a, view, the, affirmation, that, snow, is, white, is, already, something, added, to, the, sensory, experience, which, in, itself, may, not, amount, to, much, more, than, the, presentation, of, a, patch, of, whiteness, one, problem, for, this, non, conceptualist, approach, to, perceptual, experience, is, that, it, faces, difficulties, in, explaining, how, sensory, experiences, can, justify, beliefs, as, they, apparently, do, one, way, to, avoid, this, problem, is, to, deny, this, appearance, by, holding, that, they, do, not, justify, beliefs, but, only, cause, beliefs, on, the, coherence, theory, of, justification, these, beliefs, may, still, be, justified, not, because, of, the, experiences, responsible, for, them, but, because, of, the, way, they, cohere, with, the, rest, of, the, person, s, beliefs, because, of, its, relation, to, justification, and, knowledge, experience, plays, a, central, role, for, empirical, rationality, whether, it, is, rational, for, someone, to, believe, a, certain, claim, depends, among, other, things, on, the, experiences, this, person, has, made, for, example, a, teacher, may, be, justified, in, believing, that, a, certain, student, will, pass, an, exam, based, on, the, teacher, s, experience, with, the, student, in, the, classroom, but, the, same, belief, would, not, be, justified, for, a, stranger, lacking, these, experiences, rationality, is, relative, to, experience, in, this, sense, this, implies, that, it, may, be, rational, for, one, person, to, accept, a, certain, claim, while, another, person, may, rationally, reject, the, same, claim, closely, related, to, the, role, of, experience, in, epistemology, is, its, role, in, science, it, is, often, argued, that, observational, experience, is, central, to, scientific, experiments, the, evidence, obtained, in, this, manner, is, then, used, to, confirm, or, disconfirm, scientific, theories, in, this, way, experience, acts, as, a, neutral, arbiter, between, competing, theories, for, example, astronomical, observations, made, by, galileo, galilei, concerning, the, orbits, of, planets, were, used, as, evidence, in, the, copernican, revolution, in, which, the, traditional, geocentric, model, was, rejected, in, favor, of, the, heliocentric, model, one, problem, for, this, view, is, that, it, is, essential, for, scientific, evidence, to, be, public, and, uncontroversial, the, reason, for, this, is, that, different, scientists, should, be, able, to, share, the, same, evidence, in, order, to, come, to, an, agreement, about, which, hypothesis, is, correct, but, experience, is, usually, understood, as, a, private, mental, state, not, as, a, publicly, observable, phenomenon, thereby, putting, its, role, as, scientific, evidence, into, question, a, central, problem, in, metaphysics, is, the, mind, body, problem, it, involves, the, question, of, how, to, conceive, the, relation, between, body, and, mind, understood, in, its, widest, sense, it, concerns, not, only, experience, but, any, form, of, mind, including, unconscious, mental, states, but, it, has, been, argued, that, experience, has, special, relevance, here, since, experience, is, often, seen, as, the, paradigmatic, form, of, mind, the, idea, that, there, is, a, problem, to, begin, with, is, often, traced, back, to, how, different, matter, and, experience, seem, to, be, physical, properties, like, size, shape, and, weight, are, public, and, are, ascribed, to, objects, experiences, on, the, other, hand, are, private, and, are, ascribed, to, subjects, another, important, distinctive, feature, is, that, experiences, are, intentional, i, e, that, they, are, directed, at, objects, different, from, themselves, but, despite, these, differences, body, and, mind, seem, to, causally, interact, with, each, other, referred, to, as, psycho, physical, causation, this, concerns, both, the, way, how, physical, events, like, a, rock, falling, on, someone, s, foot, cause, experiences, like, a, sharp, pain, and, how, experiences, like, the, intention, to, make, the, pain, stop, cause, physical, events, like, pulling, the, foot, from, under, the, rock, various, solutions, to, the, mind, body, problem, have, been, presented, dualism, is, a, traditionally, important, approach, it, states, that, bodies, and, minds, belong, to, distinct, ontological, categories, and, exist, independently, of, each, other, a, central, problem, for, dualists, is, to, give, a, plausible, explanation, of, how, their, interaction, is, possible, or, of, why, they, seem, to, be, interacting, monists, on, the, other, hand, deny, this, type, of, ontological, bifurcation, instead, they, argue, that, on, the, most, fundamental, level, only, one, type, of, entity, exists, according, to, materialism, everything, is, ultimately, material, on, this, view, minds, either, do, not, exist, or, exist, as, material, aspects, of, bodies, according, to, idealism, everything, is, ultimately, mental, on, this, view, material, objects, only, exist, in, the, form, of, ideas, and, depend, thereby, on, experience, and, other, mental, states, monists, are, faced, with, the, problem, of, explaining, how, two, types, of, entities, that, seem, to, be, so, different, can, belong, to, the, same, ontological, category, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, is, a, closely, related, issue, it, is, concerned, with, explaining, why, some, physical, events, like, brain, processes, are, accompanied, by, conscious, experience, i, e, that, undergoing, them, feels, a, certain, way, to, the, subject, this, is, especially, relevant, from, the, perspective, of, the, natural, sciences, since, it, seems, to, be, possible, at, least, in, principle, to, explain, human, behavior, and, cognition, without, reference, to, experience, such, an, explanation, can, happen, in, relation, to, the, processing, of, information, in, the, form, of, electrical, signals, in, this, sense, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, points, to, an, explanatory, gap, between, the, physical, world, and, conscious, experience, there, is, significant, overlap, between, the, solutions, proposed, to, the, mind, body, problem, and, the, solutions, proposed, to, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, another, disagreement, between, empiricists, and, rationalists, besides, their, epistemological, dispute, concerns, the, role, of, experience, in, the, formation, of, concepts, concepts, are, general, notions, that, constitute, the, fundamental, building, blocks, of, thought, some, empiricists, hold, that, all, concepts, are, learned, from, experience, this, is, sometimes, explained, by, claiming, that, concepts, just, constitute, generalizations, abstractions, or, copies, of, the, original, contents, of, experience, logical, empiricists, for, example, have, used, this, idea, in, an, effort, to, reduce, the, content, of, all, empirical, propositions, to, protocol, sentences, recording, nothing, but, the, scientists, immediate, experiences, this, idea, is, convincing, for, some, concepts, like, the, concept, of, red, or, of, dog, which, seem, to, be, acquired, through, experience, with, their, instances, but, it, is, controversial, whether, this, is, true, for, all, concepts, immanuel, kant, for, example, defends, a, rationalist, position, by, holding, that, experience, requires, certain, concepts, so, basic, that, it, would, not, be, possible, without, them, these, concepts, the, so, called, categories, cannot, be, acquired, through, experience, since, they, are, the, conditions, of, the, possibility, of, experience, according, to, kant
