a, thought, experiment, is, a, hypothetical, situation, in, which, a, hypothesis, theory, or, principle, is, laid, out, for, the, purpose, of, thinking, through, its, consequences, the, concept, is, also, referred, to, using, the, german, language, term, gedankenexperiment, within, the, work, of, the, physicist, ernst, mach, and, includes, thoughts, about, what, may, have, occurred, if, a, different, course, of, action, were, taken, the, importance, of, this, ability, is, that, it, allows, the, experimenter, to, imagine, what, may, occur, in, the, future, as, well, as, the, implications, of, alternate, courses, of, action, the, ancient, greek, deiknymi, thought, experiment, was, the, most, ancient, pattern, of, mathematical, proof, and, existed, before, euclidean, mathematics, where, the, emphasis, was, on, the, conceptual, rather, than, on, the, experimental, part, of, a, thought, experiment, johann, witt, hansen, established, that, hans, christian, rsted, was, the, first, to, use, the, equivalent, german, term, gedankenexperiment, c, 1812, rsted, was, also, the, first, to, use, the, equivalent, term, gedankenversuch, in, 1820, by, 1883, ernst, mach, used, gedankenexperiment, in, a, different, sense, to, denote, exclusively, the, imaginary, conduct, of, a, real, experiment, that, would, be, subsequently, performed, as, a, real, physical, experiment, by, his, students, physical, and, mental, experimentation, could, then, be, contrasted, mach, asked, his, students, to, provide, him, with, explanations, whenever, the, results, from, their, subsequent, real, physical, experiment, differed, from, those, of, their, prior, imaginary, experiment, the, english, term, thought, experiment, was, coined, as, a, calque, of, gedankenexperiment, and, it, first, appeared, in, the, 1897, english, translation, of, one, of, mach, s, papers, prior, to, its, emergence, the, activity, of, posing, hypothetical, questions, that, employed, subjunctive, reasoning, had, existed, for, a, very, long, time, for, both, scientists, and, philosophers, the, irrealis, moods, are, ways, to, categorize, it, or, to, speak, about, it, this, helps, explain, the, extremely, wide, and, diverse, range, of, the, application, of, the, term, thought, experiment, once, it, had, been, introduced, into, english, galileo, s, demonstration, that, falling, objects, must, fall, at, the, same, rate, regardless, of, their, masses, was, a, significant, step, forward, in, the, history, of, modern, science, this, is, widely, thought, to, have, been, a, straightforward, physical, demonstration, involving, climbing, up, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, and, dropping, two, heavy, weights, off, it, whereas, in, fact, it, was, a, logical, demonstration, using, the, thought, experiment, technique, the, experiment, is, described, by, galileo, in, discorsi, e, dimostrazioni, matematiche, 1638, from, italian, mathematical, discourses, and, demonstrations, thus, salviati, if, then, we, take, two, bodies, whose, natural, speeds, are, different, it, is, clear, that, on, uniting, the, two, the, more, rapid, one, will, be, partly, retarded, by, the, slower, and, the, slower, will, be, somewhat, hastened, by, the, swifter, do, you, not, agree, with, me, in, this, opinion, simplicio, you, are, unquestionably, right, salviati, but, if, this, is, true, and, if, a, large, stone, moves, with, a, speed, of, say, eight, while, a, smaller, moves, with, a, speed, of, four, then, when, they, are, united, the, system, will, move, with, a, speed, less, than, eight, but, the, two, stones, when, tied, together, make, a, stone, larger, than, that, which, before, moved, with, a, speed, of, eight, hence, the, heavier, body, moves, with, less, speed, than, the, lighter, an, effect, which, is, contrary, to, your, supposition, thus, you, see, how, from, your, assumption, that, the, heavier, body, moves, more, rapidly, than, the, lighter, one, i, infer, that, the, heavier, body, moves, more, slowly, the, common, goal, of, a, thought, experiment, is, to, explore, the, potential, consequences, of, the, principle, in, question, a, thought, experiment, is, a, device, with, which, one, performs, an, intentional, structured, process, of, intellectual, deliberation, in, order, to, speculate, within, a, specifiable, problem, domain, about, potential, consequents, or, antecedents, for, a, designated, antecedent, or, consequent, given, the, structure, of, the, experiment, it, may, not, be, possible, to, perform, it, and, even, if, it, could, be, performed, there, need, not, be, an, intention, to, perform, it, examples, of, thought, experiments, include, schr, dinger, s, cat, illustrating, quantum, indeterminacy, through, the, manipulation, of, a, perfectly, sealed, environment, and, a, tiny, bit, of, radioactive, substance, and, maxwell, s, demon, which, attempts, to, demonstrate, the, ability, of, a, hypothetical, finite, being, to, violate, the, 2nd, law, of, thermodynamics, it, is, a, common, element, of, science, fiction, stories, thought, experiments, which, are, well, structured, well, defined, hypothetical, questions, that, employ, subjunctive, reasoning, irrealis, moods, what, might, happen, or, what, might, have, happened, if, have, been, used, to, pose, questions, in, philosophy, at, least, since, greek, antiquity, some, pre, dating, socrates, in, physics, and, other, sciences, many, thought, experiments, date, from, the, 19th, and, especially, the, 20th, century, but, examples, can, be, found, at, least, as, early, as, galileo, in, thought, experiments, we, gain, new, information, by, rearranging, or, reorganizing, already, known, empirical, data, in, a, new, way, and, drawing, new, a, priori, inferences, from, them, or, by, looking, at, these, data, from, a, different, and, unusual, perspective, in, galileo, s, thought, experiment, for, example, the, rearrangement, of, empirical, experience, consists, of, the, original, idea, of, combining, bodies, of, different, weights, thought, experiments, have, been, used, in, philosophy, especially, ethics, physics, and, other, fields, such, as, cognitive, psychology, history, political, science, economics, social, psychology, law, organizational, studies, marketing, and, epidemiology, in, law, the, synonym, hypothetical, is, frequently, used, for, such, experiments, regardless, of, their, intended, goal, all, thought, experiments, display, a, patterned, way, of, thinking, that, is, designed, to, allow, us, to, explain, predict, and, control, events, in, a, better, and, more, productive, way, in, terms, of, their, theoretical, consequences, thought, experiments, generally, thought, experiments, can, produce, some, very, important, and, different, outlooks, on, previously, unknown, or, unaccepted, theories, however, they, may, make, those, theories, themselves, irrelevant, and, could, possibly, create, new, problems, that, are, just, as, difficult, or, possibly, more, difficult, to, resolve, in, terms, of, their, practical, application, thought, experiments, are, generally, created, to, generally, speaking, there, are, seven, types, of, thought, experiments, in, which, one, reasons, from, causes, to, effects, or, effects, to, causes, prefactual, before, the, fact, thought, experiments, the, term, prefactual, was, coined, by, lawrence, j, sanna, in, 1998, speculate, on, possible, future, outcomes, given, the, present, and, ask, what, will, be, the, outcome, if, event, e, occurs, counterfactual, contrary, to, established, fact, thought, experiments, the, term, counterfactual, was, coined, by, nelson, goodman, in, 1947, extending, roderick, chisholm, s, 1946, notion, of, a, contrary, to, fact, conditional, speculate, on, the, possible, outcomes, of, a, different, past, and, ask, what, might, have, happened, if, a, had, happened, instead, of, b, e, g, if, isaac, newton, and, gottfried, leibniz, had, cooperated, with, each, other, what, would, mathematics, look, like, today, the, study, of, counterfactual, speculation, has, increasingly, engaged, the, interest, of, scholars, in, a, wide, range, of, domains, such, as, philosophy, psychology, cognitive, psychology, history, political, science, economics, social, psychology, law, organizational, theory, marketing, and, epidemiology, semifactual, thought, experiments, the, term, semifactual, was, coined, by, nelson, goodman, in, 1947, speculate, on, the, extent, to, which, things, might, have, remained, the, same, despite, there, being, a, different, past, and, asks, the, question, even, though, x, happened, instead, of, e, would, y, have, still, occurred, e, g, even, if, the, goalie, had, moved, left, rather, than, right, could, he, have, intercepted, a, ball, that, was, traveling, at, such, a, speed, semifactual, speculations, are, an, important, part, of, clinical, medicine, the, activity, of, prediction, attempts, to, project, the, circumstances, of, the, present, into, the, future, according, to, david, sarewitz, and, roger, pielke, 1999, p123, scientific, prediction, takes, two, forms, although, they, perform, different, social, and, scientific, functions, the, only, difference, between, the, qualitatively, identical, activities, of, predicting, forecasting, and, nowcasting, is, the, distance, of, the, speculated, future, from, the, present, moment, occupied, by, the, user, whilst, the, activity, of, nowcasting, defined, as, a, detailed, description, of, the, current, weather, along, with, forecasts, obtained, by, extrapolation, up, to, 2, hours, ahead, is, essentially, concerned, with, describing, the, current, state, of, affairs, it, is, common, practice, to, extend, the, term, to, cover, very, short, range, forecasting, up, to, 12, hours, ahead, browning, 1982, p, ix, the, activity, of, hindcasting, involves, running, a, forecast, model, after, an, event, has, happened, in, order, to, test, whether, the, model, s, simulation, is, valid, the, activity, of, retrodiction, or, postdiction, involves, moving, backward, in, time, step, by, step, in, as, many, stages, as, are, considered, necessary, from, the, present, into, the, speculated, past, to, establish, the, ultimate, cause, of, a, specific, event, e, g, reverse, engineering, and, forensics, given, that, retrodiction, is, a, process, in, which, past, observations, events, add, and, data, are, used, as, evidence, to, infer, the, process, es, that, produced, them, and, that, diagnosis, involve, going, from, visible, effects, such, as, symptoms, signs, and, the, like, to, their, prior, causes, the, essential, balance, between, prediction, and, retrodiction, could, be, characterized, as, regardless, of, whether, the, prognosis, is, of, the, course, of, the, disease, in, the, absence, of, treatment, or, of, the, application, of, a, specific, treatment, regimen, to, a, specific, disorder, in, a, particular, patient, the, activity, of, backcasting, the, term, backcasting, was, coined, by, john, robinson, in, 1982, involves, establishing, the, description, of, a, very, definite, and, very, specific, future, situation, it, then, involves, an, imaginary, moving, backward, in, time, step, by, step, in, as, many, stages, as, are, considered, necessary, from, the, future, to, the, present, to, reveal, the, mechanism, through, which, that, particular, specified, future, could, be, attained, from, the, present, backcasting, is, not, concerned, with, predicting, the, future, the, major, distinguishing, characteristic, of, backcasting, analyses, is, the, concern, not, with, likely, energy, futures, but, with, how, desirable, futures, can, be, attained, it, is, thus, explicitly, normative, involving, working, backward, from, a, particular, future, end, point, to, the, present, to, determine, what, policy, measures, would, be, required, to, reach, that, future, according, to, jansen, 1994, p, 503, within, the, framework, of, technological, development, forecasting, concerns, the, extrapolation, of, developments, towards, the, future, and, the, exploration, of, achievements, that, can, be, realized, through, technology, in, the, long, term, conversely, the, reasoning, behind, backcasting, is, on, the, basis, of, an, interconnecting, picture, of, demands, technology, must, meet, in, the, future, sustainability, criteria, to, direct, and, determine, the, process, that, technology, development, must, take, and, possibly, also, the, pace, at, which, this, development, process, must, take, effect, backcasting, both, an, important, aid, in, determining, the, direction, technology, development, must, take, and, in, specifying, the, targets, to, be, set, for, this, purpose, as, such, backcasting, is, an, ideal, search, toward, determining, the, nature, and, scope, of, the, technological, challenge, posed, by, sustainable, development, and, it, can, thus, serve, to, direct, the, search, process, toward, new, sustainable, technology, thought, experiments, have, been, used, in, a, variety, of, fields, including, philosophy, law, physics, and, mathematics, in, philosophy, they, have, been, used, at, least, since, classical, antiquity, some, pre, dating, socrates, in, law, they, were, well, known, to, roman, lawyers, quoted, in, the, digest, in, physics, and, other, sciences, notable, thought, experiments, date, from, the, 19th, and, especially, the, 20th, century, but, examples, can, be, found, at, least, as, early, as, galileo, in, philosophy, a, thought, experiment, typically, presents, an, imagined, scenario, with, the, intention, of, eliciting, an, intuitive, or, reasoned, response, about, the, way, things, are, in, the, thought, experiment, philosophers, might, also, supplement, their, thought, experiments, with, theoretical, reasoning, designed, to, support, the, desired, intuitive, response, the, scenario, will, typically, be, designed, to, target, a, particular, philosophical, notion, such, as, morality, or, the, nature, of, the, mind, or, linguistic, reference, the, response, to, the, imagined, scenario, is, supposed, to, tell, us, about, the, nature, of, that, notion, in, any, scenario, real, or, imagined, for, example, a, thought, experiment, might, present, a, situation, in, which, an, agent, intentionally, kills, an, innocent, for, the, benefit, of, others, here, the, relevant, question, is, not, whether, the, action, is, moral, or, not, but, more, broadly, whether, a, moral, theory, is, correct, that, says, morality, is, determined, solely, by, an, action, s, consequences, see, consequentialism, john, searle, imagines, a, man, in, a, locked, room, who, receives, written, sentences, in, chinese, and, returns, written, sentences, in, chinese, according, to, a, sophisticated, instruction, manual, here, the, relevant, question, is, not, whether, or, not, the, man, understands, chinese, but, more, broadly, whether, a, functionalist, theory, of, mind, is, correct, it, is, generally, hoped, that, there, is, universal, agreement, about, the, intuitions, that, a, thought, experiment, elicits, hence, in, assessing, their, own, thought, experiments, philosophers, may, appeal, to, what, we, should, say, or, some, such, locution, a, successful, thought, experiment, will, be, one, in, which, intuitions, about, it, are, widely, shared, but, often, philosophers, differ, in, their, intuitions, about, the, scenario, other, philosophical, uses, of, imagined, scenarios, arguably, are, thought, experiments, also, in, one, use, of, scenarios, philosophers, might, imagine, persons, in, a, particular, situation, maybe, ourselves, and, ask, what, they, would, do, for, example, in, the, veil, of, ignorance, john, rawls, asks, us, to, imagine, a, group, of, persons, in, a, situation, where, they, know, nothing, about, themselves, and, are, charged, with, devising, a, social, or, political, organization, the, use, of, the, state, of, nature, to, imagine, the, origins, of, government, as, by, thomas, hobbes, and, john, locke, may, also, be, considered, a, thought, experiment, s, ren, kierkegaard, explored, the, possible, ethical, and, religious, implications, of, abraham, s, binding, of, isaac, in, fear, and, trembling, similarly, friedrich, nietzsche, in, on, the, genealogy, of, morals, speculated, about, the, historical, development, of, judeo, christian, morality, with, the, intent, of, questioning, its, legitimacy, an, early, written, thought, experiment, was, plato, s, allegory, of, the, cave, another, historic, thought, experiment, was, avicenna, s, floating, man, thought, experiment, in, the, 11th, century, he, asked, his, readers, to, imagine, themselves, suspended, in, the, air, isolated, from, all, sensations, in, order, to, demonstrate, human, self, awareness, and, self, consciousness, and, the, substantiality, of, the, soul, scientists, tend, to, use, thought, experiments, as, imaginary, proxy, experiments, prior, to, a, real, physical, experiment, ernst, mach, always, argued, that, these, gedankenexperiments, were, a, necessary, precondition, for, physical, experiment, in, these, cases, the, result, of, the, proxy, experiment, will, often, be, so, clear, that, there, will, be, no, need, to, conduct, a, physical, experiment, at, all, scientists, also, use, thought, experiments, when, particular, physical, experiments, are, impossible, to, conduct, carl, gustav, hempel, labeled, these, sorts, of, experiment, theoretical, experiments, in, imagination, such, as, einstein, s, thought, experiment, of, chasing, a, light, beam, leading, to, special, relativity, this, is, a, unique, use, of, a, scientific, thought, experiment, in, that, it, was, never, carried, out, but, led, to, a, successful, theory, proven, by, other, empirical, means, further, categorization, of, thought, experiments, can, be, attributed, to, specific, properties, in, many, thought, experiments, the, scenario, would, be, nomologically, possible, or, possible, according, to, the, laws, of, nature, john, searle, s, chinese, room, is, nomologically, possible, some, thought, experiments, present, scenarios, that, are, not, nomologically, possible, in, his, twin, earth, thought, experiment, hilary, putnam, asks, us, to, imagine, a, scenario, in, which, there, is, a, substance, with, all, of, the, observable, properties, of, water, e, g, taste, color, boiling, point, but, is, chemically, different, from, water, it, has, been, argued, that, this, thought, experiment, is, not, nomologically, possible, although, it, may, be, possible, in, some, other, sense, such, as, metaphysical, possibility, it, is, debatable, whether, the, nomological, impossibility, of, a, thought, experiment, renders, intuitions, about, it, moot, in, some, cases, the, hypothetical, scenario, might, be, considered, metaphysically, impossible, or, impossible, in, any, sense, at, all, david, chalmers, says, that, we, can, imagine, that, there, are, zombies, or, persons, who, are, physically, identical, to, us, in, every, way, but, who, lack, consciousness, this, is, supposed, to, show, that, physicalism, is, false, however, some, argue, that, zombies, are, inconceivable, we, can, no, more, imagine, a, zombie, than, we, can, imagine, that, 1, 1, 3, others, have, claimed, that, the, conceivability, of, a, scenario, may, not, entail, its, possibility, the, first, characteristic, pattern, that, thought, experiments, display, is, their, orientation, in, time, they, are, either, the, second, characteristic, pattern, is, their, movement, in, time, in, relation, to, the, present, moment, standpoint, of, the, individual, performing, the, experiment, namely, in, terms, of, the, relation, to, real, experiments, can, be, quite, complex, as, can, be, seen, again, from, an, example, going, back, to, albert, einstein, in, 1935, with, two, coworkers, he, published, a, paper, on, a, newly, created, subject, called, later, the, epr, effect, epr, paradox, in, this, paper, starting, from, certain, philosophical, assumptions, on, the, basis, of, a, rigorous, analysis, of, a, certain, complicated, but, in, the, meantime, assertedly, realizable, model, he, came, to, the, conclusion, that, quantum, mechanics, should, be, described, as, incomplete, niels, bohr, asserted, a, refutation, of, einstein, s, analysis, immediately, and, his, view, prevailed, after, some, decades, it, was, asserted, that, feasible, experiments, could, prove, the, error, of, the, epr, paper, these, experiments, tested, the, bell, inequalities, published, in, 1964, in, a, purely, theoretical, paper, the, above, mentioned, epr, philosophical, starting, assumptions, were, considered, to, be, falsified, by, the, empirical, fact, e, g, by, the, optical, real, experiments, of, alain, aspect, thus, thought, experiments, belong, to, a, theoretical, discipline, usually, to, theoretical, physics, but, often, to, theoretical, philosophy, in, any, case, it, must, be, distinguished, from, a, real, experiment, which, belongs, naturally, to, the, experimental, discipline, and, has, the, final, decision, on, true, or, not, true, at, least, in, physics, thought, experiments, can, also, be, interactive, where, the, author, invites, people, into, his, thought, process, through, providing, alternative, paths, with, alternative, outcomes, within, the, narrative, or, through, interaction, with, a, programmed, machine, like, a, computer, program, thanks, to, the, advent, of, the, internet, the, digital, space, has, lent, itself, as, a, new, medium, for, a, new, kind, of, thought, experiments, the, philosophical, work, of, stefano, gualeni, for, example, focuses, on, the, use, of, virtual, worlds, to, materialize, thought, experiments, and, to, playfully, negotiate, philosophical, ideas, his, arguments, were, originally, presented, in, his, 2015, book, virtual, worlds, as, philosophical, tools, gualeni, s, argument, is, that, the, history, of, philosophy, has, until, recently, merely, been, the, history, of, written, thought, and, digital, media, can, complement, and, enrich, the, limited, and, almost, exclusively, linguistic, approach, to, philosophical, thought, he, considers, virtual, worlds, like, those, interactively, encountered, in, videogames, to, be, philosophically, viable, and, advantageous, this, is, especially, the, case, in, thought, experiments, when, the, recipients, of, a, certain, philosophical, notion, or, perspective, are, expected, to, objectively, test, and, evaluate, different, possible, courses, of, action, or, in, cases, where, they, are, confronted, with, interrogatives, concerning, non, actual, or, non, human, phenomenologies
