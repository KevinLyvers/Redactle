the, new, testament, nt, is, the, second, division, of, the, christian, biblical, canon, it, discusses, the, teachings, and, person, of, jesus, as, well, as, events, relating, to, first, century, christianity, the, new, testament, s, background, the, first, division, of, the, christian, bible, is, called, the, old, testament, which, is, based, primarily, upon, the, hebrew, bible, together, they, are, regarded, as, sacred, scripture, by, christians, the, new, testament, is, a, collection, of, christian, texts, originally, written, in, the, koine, greek, language, at, different, times, by, various, authors, while, the, old, testament, canon, varies, somewhat, between, different, christian, denominations, the, 27, book, canon, of, the, new, testament, has, been, almost, universally, recognized, within, christianity, since, at, least, late, antiquity, thus, in, almost, all, christian, traditions, today, the, new, testament, consists, of, 27, books, the, earliest, known, complete, list, of, the, 27, books, is, found, in, a, letter, written, by, athanasius, a, 4th, century, bishop, of, alexandria, dated, to, 367, ad, the, 27, book, new, testament, was, first, formally, canonized, during, the, councils, of, hippo, 393, and, carthage, 397, in, north, africa, pope, innocent, i, ratified, the, same, canon, in, 405, but, it, is, probable, that, a, council, in, rome, in, 382, under, pope, damasus, i, gave, the, same, list, first, these, councils, also, provided, the, canon, of, the, old, testament, which, included, the, deuterocanonical, books, there, is, no, scholarly, consensus, on, the, date, of, composition, of, the, latest, new, testament, texts, john, a, t, robinson, dan, wallace, and, william, f, albright, dated, all, the, books, of, the, new, testament, before, 70, ad, many, other, scholars, such, as, bart, d, ehrman, and, stephen, l, harris, date, some, new, testament, texts, much, later, than, this, richard, pervo, dated, luke, acts, to, c, 115, ad, and, david, trobisch, places, acts, in, the, mid, to, late, second, century, contemporaneous, with, the, publication, of, the, first, new, testament, canon, the, new, oxford, annotated, bible, claims, scholars, generally, agree, that, the, gospels, were, written, forty, to, sixty, years, after, the, death, of, jesus, they, thus, do, not, present, eyewitness, or, contemporary, accounts, of, jesus, s, life, and, teaching, the, esv, study, bible, claims, the, following, as, one, argument, for, gospel, authenticity, because, luke, as, a, second, generation, christian, claims, to, have, retrieved, eyewitness, testimony, luke, 1, 1, 4, in, addition, to, having, traveled, with, paul, the, apostle, acts, 16, 10, 17, arguing, for, an, authorship, date, of, c, ad, 62, which, is, corroborated, by, paul, s, letter, to, the, colossians, col, 4, 14, letter, to, philemon, philem, 23, 24, and, second, letter, to, timothy, 2, tim, 4, 11, the, gospel, account, of, luke, was, received, as, having, apostolic, endorsement, and, authority, from, paul, and, as, a, trustworthy, record, of, the, gospel, that, paul, preached, e, g, rom, 2, 16, according, to, eusebius, in, ecclesiastical, history, 3, 4, 8, the, word, testament, in, the, expression, new, testament, refers, to, a, christian, new, covenant, that, christians, believe, completes, or, fulfils, the, mosaic, covenant, the, jewish, covenant, that, yahweh, the, god, of, israel, made, with, the, people, of, israel, on, mount, sinai, through, moses, described, in, the, books, of, the, old, testament, of, the, christian, bible, while, christianity, traditionally, even, claims, this, christian, new, covenant, as, being, prophesied, in, the, jewish, bible, s, book, of, jeremiah, judaism, traditionally, disagrees, behold, the, days, come, saith, the, lord, that, i, will, make, a, new, covenant, with, the, house, of, israel, and, with, the, house, of, judah, not, according, to, the, covenant, that, i, made, with, their, fathers, in, the, day, that, i, took, them, by, the, hand, to, bring, them, out, of, the, land, of, egypt, forasmuch, as, they, broke, my, covenant, although, i, was, a, lord, over, them, saith, the, lord, but, this, is, the, covenant, that, i, will, make, with, the, house, of, israel, after, those, days, saith, the, lord, i, will, put, my, law, in, their, inward, parts, and, in, their, heart, will, i, write, it, and, i, will, be, their, god, and, they, shall, be, my, people, and, they, shall, teach, no, more, every, man, his, neighbour, and, every, man, his, brother, saying, know, the, lord, for, they, shall, all, know, me, from, the, least, of, them, unto, the, greatest, of, them, saith, the, lord, for, i, will, forgive, their, iniquity, and, their, sin, will, i, remember, no, more, the, word, covenant, means, agreement, from, latin, con, venio, to, agree, lit, to, come, together, the, use, of, the, word, testament, which, describes, the, different, idea, of, written, instructions, for, inheritance, after, death, to, refer, to, the, covenant, with, israel, in, the, old, testament, is, foreign, to, the, original, hebrew, word, brit, describing, it, which, only, means, alliance, covenant, pact, and, never, inheritance, instructions, after, death, this, use, comes, from, the, transcription, of, latin, testamentum, will, left, after, death, a, literal, translation, of, greek, diatheke, will, left, after, death, which, is, the, word, used, to, translate, hebrew, brit, in, the, septuagint, the, choice, of, this, word, diatheke, by, the, jewish, translators, of, the, septuagint, in, alexandria, in, the, 3rd, and, 2nd, century, bce, has, been, understood, in, christian, theology, to, imply, a, reinterpreted, view, of, the, old, testament, covenant, with, israel, as, possessing, characteristics, of, a, will, left, after, death, the, death, of, jesus, and, has, generated, considerable, attention, from, biblical, scholars, and, theologians, in, contrast, to, the, jewish, usage, where, brit, was, the, usual, hebrew, word, used, to, refer, to, pacts, alliances, and, covenants, in, general, like, a, common, pact, between, two, individuals, and, to, the, one, between, god, and, israel, in, particular, in, the, greek, world, diatheke, was, virtually, never, used, to, refer, to, an, alliance, or, covenant, one, exception, is, noted, in, a, passage, from, aristophanes, and, referred, instead, to, a, will, left, after, the, death, of, a, person, there, is, scholarly, debate, as, to, the, reason, why, the, translators, of, the, septuagint, chose, the, term, diatheke, to, translate, hebrew, brit, instead, of, another, greek, word, generally, used, to, refer, to, an, alliance, or, covenant, the, use, of, the, phrase, new, testament, koine, greek, h, kain, diath, k, to, describe, a, collection, of, first, and, second, century, christian, greek, scriptures, can, be, traced, back, to, tertullian, in, his, work, against, praxeas, irenaeus, uses, the, phrase, new, testament, several, times, but, does, not, use, it, in, reference, to, any, written, text, in, against, marcion, written, c, 208, ad, tertullian, writes, of, the, divine, word, who, is, doubly, edged, with, the, two, testaments, of, the, law, and, the, gospel, and, tertullian, continues, later, in, the, book, writing, it, is, certain, that, the, whole, aim, at, which, he, has, strenuously, laboured, even, in, the, drawing, up, of, his, antitheses, centres, in, this, that, he, may, establish, a, diversity, between, the, old, and, the, new, testaments, so, that, his, own, christ, may, be, separate, from, the, creator, as, belonging, to, this, rival, god, and, as, alien, from, the, law, and, the, prophets, by, the, 4th, century, the, existence, even, if, not, the, exact, contents, of, both, an, old, and, new, testament, had, been, established, lactantius, a, 3rd, 4th, century, christian, author, wrote, in, his, early, 4th, century, latin, institutiones, divinae, divine, institutes, but, all, scripture, is, divided, into, two, testaments, that, which, preceded, the, advent, and, passion, of, christ, that, is, the, law, and, the, prophets, is, called, the, old, but, those, things, which, were, written, after, his, resurrection, are, named, the, new, testament, the, jews, make, use, of, the, old, we, of, the, new, but, yet, they, are, not, discordant, for, the, new, is, the, fulfilling, of, the, old, and, in, both, there, is, the, same, testator, even, christ, who, having, suffered, death, for, us, made, us, heirs, of, his, everlasting, kingdom, the, people, of, the, jews, being, deprived, and, disinherited, as, the, prophet, jeremiah, testifies, when, he, speaks, such, things, behold, the, days, come, saith, the, lord, that, i, will, make, a, new, testament, to, the, house, of, israel, and, the, house, of, judah, not, according, to, the, testament, which, i, made, to, their, fathers, in, the, day, that, i, took, them, by, the, hand, to, bring, them, out, of, the, land, of, egypt, for, they, continued, not, in, my, testament, and, i, disregarded, them, saith, the, lord, for, that, which, he, said, above, that, he, would, make, a, new, testament, to, the, house, of, judah, shows, that, the, old, testament, which, was, given, by, moses, was, not, perfect, but, that, which, was, to, be, given, by, christ, would, be, complete, eusebius, describes, the, collection, of, christian, writings, as, covenanted, books, in, hist, eccl, 3, 3, 1, 7, 3, 25, 3, 5, 8, 1, 6, 25, 1, each, of, the, four, gospels, in, the, new, testament, narrates, the, life, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, of, nazareth, the, gospel, of, mark, in, the, original, text, ends, with, the, empty, tomb, and, has, no, account, of, the, post, resurrection, appearances, but, the, emptiness, of, the, tomb, implies, a, resurrection, the, word, gospel, derives, from, the, old, english, g, d, spell, rarely, godspel, meaning, good, news, or, glad, tidings, its, hebrew, equivalent, being, besorah, the, gospel, was, considered, the, good, news, of, the, coming, kingdom, of, messiah, and, the, redemption, through, the, life, and, death, of, jesus, the, central, christian, message, gospel, is, a, calque, word, for, word, translation, of, the, greek, word, euangelion, eu, good, angelion, message, they, were, written, between, approximately, 70, and, 100, ad, and, were, the, end, products, of, a, long, process, of, development, starting, in, the, late, second, century, the, four, narrative, accounts, of, the, life, and, work, of, jesus, christ, have, been, referred, to, as, the, gospel, of, or, the, gospel, according, to, followed, by, the, name, of, the, supposed, author, the, first, author, to, explicitly, name, the, canonical, gospels, is, irenaeus, of, lyon, who, promoted, the, four, canonical, gospels, in, his, book, against, heresies, written, around, 180, whatever, these, early, ascriptions, may, imply, about, the, sources, behind, or, the, perception, of, these, gospels, they, are, anonymous, compositions, the, first, three, gospels, listed, above, are, classified, as, the, synoptic, gospels, they, contain, similar, accounts, of, the, events, in, jesus, s, life, and, his, teaching, due, to, their, literary, interdependence, the, gospel, of, john, is, structured, differently, and, includes, stories, of, several, miracles, of, jesus, and, sayings, not, found, in, the, other, three, these, four, gospels, that, were, eventually, included, in, the, new, testament, were, only, a, few, among, many, other, early, christian, gospels, the, existence, of, such, texts, is, even, mentioned, at, the, beginning, of, the, gospel, of, luke, other, early, christian, gospels, such, as, the, so, called, jewish, christian, gospels, or, the, gospel, of, thomas, also, offer, both, a, window, into, the, context, of, early, christianity, and, may, provide, some, assistance, in, the, reconstruction, of, the, historical, jesus, the, acts, of, the, apostles, is, a, narrative, of, the, apostles, ministry, and, activity, after, christ, s, death, and, resurrection, from, which, point, it, resumes, and, functions, as, a, sequel, to, the, gospel, of, luke, examining, style, phraseology, and, other, evidence, modern, scholarship, generally, concludes, that, acts, and, the, gospel, of, luke, share, the, same, author, referred, to, as, luke, acts, luke, acts, does, not, name, its, author, church, tradition, identified, him, as, luke, the, evangelist, the, companion, of, paul, but, the, majority, of, scholars, reject, this, due, to, the, many, differences, between, acts, and, the, authentic, pauline, letters, the, most, probable, date, of, composition, is, around, 80, 100, ad, although, some, scholars, date, it, significantly, later, and, there, is, evidence, that, it, was, still, being, substantially, revised, well, into, the, 2nd, century, the, epistles, of, the, new, testament, are, considered, by, christians, to, be, divinely, inspired, and, holy, letters, written, by, the, apostles, and, disciples, of, christ, to, either, local, congregations, with, specific, needs, or, to, new, covenant, christians, in, general, scattered, about, or, catholic, epistles, the, pauline, letters, are, the, thirteen, new, testament, books, that, present, paul, the, apostle, as, their, author, paul, s, authorship, of, six, of, the, letters, is, disputed, four, are, thought, by, most, modern, scholars, to, be, pseudepigraphic, i, e, not, actually, written, by, paul, even, if, attributed, to, him, within, the, letters, themselves, opinion, is, more, divided, on, the, other, two, disputed, letters, 2, thessalonians, and, colossians, these, letters, were, written, to, christian, communities, in, specific, cities, or, geographical, regions, often, to, address, issues, faced, by, that, particular, community, prominent, themes, include, the, relationship, both, to, broader, pagan, society, to, judaism, and, to, other, christians, the, last, four, pauline, letters, in, the, new, testament, are, addressed, to, individual, persons, they, include, the, following, all, of, the, above, except, for, philemon, are, known, as, the, pastoral, epistles, they, are, addressed, to, individuals, charged, with, pastoral, oversight, of, churches, and, discuss, issues, of, christian, living, doctrine, and, leadership, they, often, address, different, concerns, to, those, of, the, preceding, epistles, these, letters, are, believed, by, many, to, be, pseudepigraphic, some, scholars, e, g, bill, mounce, ben, witherington, r, c, sproul, will, argue, that, the, letters, are, genuinely, pauline, or, at, least, written, under, paul, s, supervision, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, addresses, a, jewish, audience, who, had, come, to, believe, that, jesus, was, the, anointed, one, hebrew, transliterated, in, english, as, moshiach, or, messiah, greek, transliterated, in, english, as, christos, for, christ, who, was, predicted, in, the, writings, of, the, hebrew, scriptures, the, author, discusses, the, superiority, of, the, new, covenant, and, the, ministry, of, jesus, to, the, mosaic, law, covenant, and, urges, the, readers, in, the, practical, implications, of, this, conviction, through, the, end, of, the, epistle, the, book, has, been, widely, accepted, by, the, christian, church, as, inspired, by, god, and, thus, authoritative, despite, the, acknowledgment, of, uncertainties, about, who, its, human, author, was, regarding, authorship, although, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, does, not, internally, claim, to, have, been, written, by, the, apostle, paul, some, similarities, in, wordings, to, some, of, the, pauline, epistles, have, been, noted, and, inferred, in, antiquity, some, began, to, ascribe, it, to, paul, in, an, attempt, to, provide, the, anonymous, work, an, explicit, apostolic, pedigree, in, the, 4th, century, jerome, and, augustine, of, hippo, supported, paul, s, authorship, the, church, largely, agreed, to, include, hebrews, as, the, fourteenth, letter, of, paul, and, affirmed, this, authorship, until, the, reformation, the, letter, to, the, hebrews, had, difficulty, in, being, accepted, as, part, of, the, christian, canon, because, of, its, anonymity, as, early, as, the, 3rd, century, origen, wrote, of, the, letter, men, of, old, have, handed, it, down, as, paul, s, but, who, wrote, the, epistle, god, only, knows, contemporary, scholars, often, reject, pauline, authorship, for, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, based, on, its, distinctive, style, and, theology, which, are, considered, to, set, it, apart, from, paul, s, writings, the, catholic, epistles, or, general, epistles, consist, of, both, letters, and, treatises, in, the, form, of, letters, written, to, the, church, at, large, the, term, catholic, greek, katholik, used, to, describe, these, letters, in, the, oldest, manuscripts, containing, them, here, simply, means, general, or, universal, and, does, not, imply, that, they, are, not, accepted, as, canonical, by, non, catholic, christians, the, authorship, of, a, number, of, these, is, disputed, the, final, book, of, the, new, testament, is, the, book, of, revelation, also, known, as, the, apocalypse, of, john, in, the, new, testament, canon, it, is, considered, prophetical, or, apocalyptic, literature, its, authorship, has, been, attributed, either, to, john, the, apostle, in, which, case, it, is, often, thought, that, john, the, apostle, is, john, the, evangelist, i, e, author, of, the, gospel, of, john, or, to, another, john, designated, john, of, patmos, after, the, island, where, the, text, says, the, revelation, was, received, 1, 9, some, ascribe, the, writership, date, as, c, 81, 96, ad, and, others, at, around, 68, ad, the, work, opens, with, letters, to, seven, local, congregations, of, asia, minor, and, thereafter, takes, the, form, of, an, apocalypse, a, revealing, of, divine, prophecy, and, mysteries, a, literary, genre, popular, in, ancient, judaism, and, christianity, the, order, in, which, the, books, of, the, new, testament, appear, differs, between, some, collections, and, ecclesiastical, traditions, in, the, latin, west, prior, to, the, vulgate, an, early, 5th, century, latin, version, of, the, bible, the, four, gospels, were, arranged, in, the, following, order, matthew, john, luke, and, mark, the, syriac, peshitta, places, the, major, catholic, epistles, james, 1, peter, and, 1, john, immediately, after, acts, and, before, the, pauline, epistles, the, order, of, an, early, edition, of, the, letters, of, paul, is, based, on, the, size, of, the, letters, longest, to, shortest, though, keeping, 1, and, 2, corinthians, and, 1, and, 2, thessalonians, together, the, pastoral, epistles, were, apparently, not, part, of, the, corpus, paulinum, in, which, this, order, originated, and, were, later, inserted, after, 2, thessalonians, and, before, philemon, hebrews, was, variously, incorporated, into, the, corpus, paulinum, either, after, 2, thessalonians, after, philemon, i, e, at, the, very, end, or, after, romans, luther, s, canon, found, in, the, 16th, century, luther, bible, continues, to, place, hebrews, james, jude, and, the, apocalypse, revelation, last, this, reflects, the, thoughts, of, the, reformer, martin, luther, on, the, canonicity, of, these, books, the, books, that, eventually, found, a, permanent, place, in, the, new, testament, were, not, the, only, works, of, christian, literature, produced, in, the, earliest, christian, centuries, the, long, process, of, canonization, began, early, sometimes, with, tacit, reception, of, traditional, texts, sometimes, with, explicit, selection, or, rejection, of, particular, texts, as, either, acceptable, or, unacceptable, for, use, in, a, given, context, e, g, not, all, texts, that, were, acceptable, for, private, use, were, considered, appropriate, for, use, in, the, liturgy, over, the, course, of, history, those, works, of, early, christian, literature, that, survived, but, that, did, not, become, part, of, the, new, testament, have, been, variously, grouped, by, theologians, and, scholars, drawing, upon, though, redefining, an, older, term, used, in, early, christianity, and, among, protestants, when, referring, to, those, books, found, in, the, christian, old, testament, although, not, in, the, hebrew, bible, modern, scholars, began, to, refer, to, these, works, of, early, christian, literature, not, included, in, the, new, testament, as, apocryphal, by, which, was, meant, non, canonical, collected, editions, of, these, works, were, then, referred, to, as, the, new, testament, apocrypha, typically, excluded, from, such, published, collections, are, the, following, groups, of, works, the, apostolic, fathers, the, 2nd, century, christian, apologists, the, alexandrians, tertullian, methodius, of, olympus, novatian, cyprian, martyrdoms, and, the, desert, fathers, almost, all, other, christian, literature, from, the, period, and, sometimes, including, works, composed, well, into, late, antiquity, are, relegated, to, the, so, called, new, testament, apocrypha, although, not, considered, to, be, divinely, inspired, by, most, these, apocryphal, works, were, produced, in, the, same, ancient, context, and, often, using, the, same, language, as, those, books, that, would, eventually, form, the, new, testament, some, of, these, later, works, are, dependent, either, directly, or, indirectly, upon, books, that, would, later, come, to, be, in, the, new, testament, or, upon, the, ideas, expressed, in, them, there, is, even, an, example, of, a, pseudepigraphical, letter, composed, under, the, guise, of, a, presumably, lost, letter, of, the, apostle, paul, the, epistle, to, the, laodiceans, it, is, considered, the, books, of, the, new, testament, were, all, or, nearly, all, written, by, jewish, christians, that, is, jewish, disciples, of, christ, who, lived, in, the, roman, empire, and, under, roman, occupation, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, luke, and, the, book, of, acts, is, frequently, thought, of, as, an, exception, scholars, are, divided, as, to, whether, he, was, a, gentile, or, a, hellenistic, jew, a, few, scholars, identify, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, mark, as, probably, a, gentile, and, similarly, for, the, gospel, of, matthew, though, most, assert, jewish, christian, authorship, however, more, recently, the, above, understanding, has, been, challenged, by, the, publication, of, evidence, showing, only, educated, elites, after, the, jewish, war, would, have, been, capable, of, producing, the, prose, found, in, the, gospels, authorship, of, the, gospels, remains, divided, among, both, evangelical, and, critical, scholars, the, names, of, each, gospel, stems, from, church, tradition, and, yet, the, authors, of, the, gospels, do, not, identify, themselves, in, their, respective, texts, all, four, gospels, and, the, acts, of, the, apostles, are, anonymous, works, the, gospel, of, john, claims, to, be, based, on, eyewitness, testimony, from, the, disciple, whom, jesus, loved, but, never, names, this, character, according, to, bart, d, ehrman, of, the, university, of, north, carolina, none, of, the, authors, of, the, gospels, were, eyewitnesses, or, even, explicitly, claimed, to, be, eyewitnesses, ehrman, has, argued, for, a, scholarly, consensus, that, many, new, testament, books, were, not, written, by, the, individuals, whose, names, are, attached, to, them, scholarly, opinion, is, that, names, were, fixed, to, the, gospels, by, the, mid, second, century, ad, many, scholars, believe, that, none, of, the, gospels, were, written, in, the, region, of, palestine, christian, tradition, identifies, john, the, apostle, with, john, the, evangelist, the, supposed, author, of, the, gospel, of, john, traditionalists, tend, to, support, the, idea, that, the, writer, of, the, gospel, of, john, himself, claimed, to, be, an, eyewitness, in, their, commentaries, of, john, 21, 24, and, therefore, the, gospel, was, written, by, an, eyewitness, this, idea, is, rejected, by, the, majority, of, modern, scholars, most, scholars, hold, to, the, two, source, hypothesis, which, posits, that, the, gospel, of, mark, was, the, first, gospel, to, be, written, on, this, view, the, authors, of, the, gospel, of, matthew, and, the, gospel, of, luke, used, as, sources, the, gospel, of, mark, and, a, hypothetical, q, document, to, write, their, individual, gospel, accounts, these, three, gospels, are, called, the, synoptic, gospels, because, they, include, many, of, the, same, stories, often, in, the, same, sequence, and, sometimes, in, exactly, the, same, wording, scholars, agree, that, the, gospel, of, john, was, written, last, by, using, a, different, tradition, and, body, of, testimony, in, addition, most, scholars, agree, that, the, author, of, luke, also, wrote, the, acts, of, the, apostles, scholars, hold, that, these, books, constituted, two, halves, of, a, single, work, luke, acts, the, same, author, appears, to, have, written, the, gospel, of, luke, and, the, acts, of, the, apostles, and, most, refer, to, them, as, the, lucan, texts, the, most, direct, evidence, comes, from, the, prefaces, of, each, book, both, were, addressed, to, theophilus, and, the, preface, to, the, acts, of, the, apostles, references, my, former, book, about, the, ministry, of, jesus, furthermore, there, are, linguistic, and, theological, similarities, between, the, two, works, suggesting, that, they, have, a, common, author, the, pauline, epistles, are, the, thirteen, books, in, the, new, testament, traditionally, attributed, to, paul, of, tarsus, seven, letters, are, generally, classified, as, undisputed, expressing, contemporary, scholarly, near, consensus, that, they, are, the, work, of, paul, romans, 1, corinthians, 2, corinthians, galatians, philippians, 1, thessalonians, and, philemon, six, additional, letters, bearing, paul, s, name, do, not, currently, enjoy, the, same, academic, consensus, ephesians, colossians, 2, thessalonians, 1, timothy, 2, timothy, and, titus, the, anonymous, epistle, to, the, hebrews, is, despite, unlikely, pauline, authorship, often, functionally, grouped, with, these, thirteen, to, form, a, corpus, of, fourteen, pauline, epistles, while, many, scholars, uphold, the, traditional, view, some, question, whether, the, first, three, called, the, deutero, pauline, epistles, are, authentic, letters, of, paul, as, for, the, latter, three, the, pastoral, epistles, some, scholars, uphold, the, traditional, view, of, these, as, the, genuine, writings, of, the, apostle, paul, most, regard, them, as, pseudepigrapha, one, might, refer, to, the, epistle, to, the, laodiceans, and, the, third, epistle, to, the, corinthians, as, examples, of, works, identified, as, pseudonymous, since, the, early, centuries, of, the, church, there, has, been, debate, concerning, the, authorship, of, the, anonymous, epistle, to, the, hebrews, and, contemporary, scholars, generally, reject, pauline, authorship, the, epistles, all, share, common, themes, emphasis, vocabulary, and, style, they, exhibit, a, uniformity, of, doctrine, concerning, the, mosaic, law, jesus, faith, and, various, other, issues, all, of, these, letters, easily, fit, into, the, chronology, of, paul, s, journeys, depicted, in, acts, of, the, apostles, the, author, of, the, epistle, of, james, identifies, himself, in, the, opening, verse, as, james, a, servant, of, god, and, of, the, lord, jesus, christ, from, the, middle, of, the, 3rd, century, patristic, authors, cited, the, epistle, as, written, by, james, the, just, ancient, and, modern, scholars, have, always, been, divided, on, the, issue, of, authorship, many, consider, the, epistle, to, be, written, in, the, late, 1st, or, early, 2nd, centuries, the, author, of, the, first, epistle, of, peter, identifies, himself, in, the, opening, verse, as, peter, an, apostle, of, jesus, christ, and, the, view, that, the, epistle, was, written, by, st, peter, is, attested, to, by, a, number, of, church, fathers, irenaeus, 140, 203, tertullian, 150, 222, clement, of, alexandria, 155, 215, and, origen, of, alexandria, 185, 253, unlike, the, second, epistle, of, peter, the, authorship, of, which, was, debated, in, antiquity, there, was, little, debate, about, peter, s, authorship, of, this, first, epistle, until, the, 18th, century, although, 2, peter, internally, purports, to, be, a, work, of, the, apostle, many, biblical, scholars, have, concluded, that, peter, is, not, the, author, for, an, early, date, and, usually, for, a, defense, of, the, apostle, peter, s, authorship, see, kruger, zahn, spitta, bigg, and, green, the, epistle, of, jude, title, is, written, as, follows, jude, a, servant, of, jesus, christ, and, brother, of, james, the, debate, has, continued, over, the, author, s, identity, as, the, apostle, the, brother, of, jesus, both, or, neither, the, gospel, of, john, the, three, johannine, epistles, and, the, book, of, revelation, exhibit, marked, similarities, although, more, so, between, the, gospel, and, the, epistles, especially, the, gospel, and, 1, john, than, between, those, and, revelation, most, scholars, therefore, treat, the, five, as, a, single, corpus, of, johannine, literature, albeit, not, from, the, same, author, the, gospel, went, through, two, or, three, editions, before, reaching, its, current, form, around, ad, 90, 110, it, speaks, of, an, unnamed, disciple, whom, jesus, loved, as, the, source, of, its, traditions, but, does, not, say, specifically, that, he, is, its, author, christian, tradition, identifies, this, disciple, as, the, apostle, john, but, while, this, idea, still, has, supporters, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, majority, of, modern, scholars, have, abandoned, it, or, hold, it, only, tenuously, it, is, significantly, different, from, the, synoptic, gospels, with, major, variations, in, material, theological, emphasis, chronology, and, literary, style, sometimes, amounting, to, contradictions, the, author, of, the, book, of, revelation, identifies, himself, several, times, as, john, and, states, that, he, was, on, patmos, when, he, received, his, first, vision, as, a, result, the, author, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, john, of, patmos, the, author, has, traditionally, been, identified, with, john, the, apostle, to, whom, the, gospel, and, the, epistles, of, john, were, attributed, it, was, believed, that, he, was, exiled, to, the, island, of, patmos, during, the, reign, of, the, roman, emperor, domitian, and, there, wrote, revelation, justin, martyr, c, 100, 165, ad, who, was, acquainted, with, polycarp, who, had, been, mentored, by, john, makes, a, possible, allusion, to, this, book, and, credits, john, as, the, source, irenaeus, c, 115, 202, assumes, it, as, a, conceded, point, according, to, the, zondervan, pictorial, encyclopedia, of, the, bible, modern, scholars, are, divided, between, the, apostolic, view, and, several, alternative, hypotheses, put, forth, in, the, last, hundred, years, or, so, ben, witherington, points, out, that, linguistic, evidence, makes, it, unlikely, that, the, books, were, written, by, the, same, person, the, earliest, manuscripts, of, new, testament, books, date, from, the, late, second, to, early, third, centuries, although, see, papyrus, 52, for, a, possible, exception, these, manuscripts, place, a, clear, upper, limit, on, the, dating, of, new, testament, texts, explicit, references, to, nt, books, in, extra, biblical, documents, can, push, this, upper, limit, down, a, bit, further, irenaeus, of, lyon, names, and, quotes, from, most, of, the, books, in, the, new, testament, in, his, book, against, heresies, written, around, 180, ad, the, epistle, of, polycarp, to, the, philippians, written, some, time, between, 110, and, polycarp, s, death, in, 155, 167, ad, quotes, or, alludes, to, most, new, testament, texts, ignatius, of, antioch, wrote, letters, referencing, much, of, the, new, testament, he, lived, from, about, 35, ad, to, 107, ad, and, is, rumored, to, have, been, a, disciple, of, the, apostle, john, his, writings, reference, the, gospels, of, john, matthew, and, luke, as, well, as, peter, james, and, paul, s, epistles, his, writing, is, usually, attributed, to, the, end, of, his, lifetime, which, places, the, gospels, as, first, century, writings, literary, analysis, of, the, new, testament, texts, themselves, can, be, used, to, date, many, of, the, books, of, the, new, testament, to, the, mid, to, late, first, century, the, earliest, works, of, the, new, testament, are, the, letters, of, the, apostle, paul, it, can, be, determined, that, 1, thessalonians, is, likely, the, earliest, of, these, letters, written, around, 52, ad, the, major, languages, spoken, by, both, jews, and, greeks, in, the, holy, land, at, the, time, of, jesus, were, aramaic, and, koine, greek, and, also, a, colloquial, dialect, of, mishnaic, hebrew, it, is, generally, agreed, by, most, scholars, that, the, historical, jesus, primarily, spoke, aramaic, perhaps, also, some, hebrew, and, koine, greek, the, majority, view, is, that, all, of, the, books, that, would, eventually, form, the, new, testament, were, written, in, the, koine, greek, language, as, christianity, spread, these, books, were, later, translated, into, other, languages, most, notably, latin, syriac, and, egyptian, coptic, some, of, the, church, fathers, imply, or, claim, that, matthew, was, originally, written, in, hebrew, or, aramaic, and, then, soon, after, was, written, in, koine, greek, nevertheless, some, scholars, believe, the, gospel, of, matthew, known, today, was, composed, in, greek, and, is, neither, directly, dependent, upon, nor, a, translation, of, a, text, in, a, semitic, language, the, style, of, koine, greek, in, which, the, new, testament, is, written, differs, from, the, general, koine, greek, used, by, greek, writers, of, the, same, era, a, difference, that, some, scholars, have, explained, by, the, fact, that, the, authors, of, the, new, testament, nearly, all, jews, and, deeply, familiar, with, the, septuagint, wrote, in, a, jewish, greek, dialect, strongly, influenced, by, aramaic, and, hebrew, see, jewish, koine, greek, related, to, the, greek, of, the, septuagint, but, other, scholars, say, that, this, view, is, arrived, at, by, comparing, the, linguistic, style, of, the, new, testament, to, the, preserved, writings, of, the, literary, men, of, the, era, who, imitated, the, style, of, the, great, attic, texts, and, as, a, result, did, not, reflect, the, everyday, spoken, language, so, that, this, difference, in, style, could, be, explained, by, the, new, testament, being, written, unlike, other, preserved, literary, material, of, the, era, in, the, koine, greek, spoken, in, everyday, life, in, order, to, appeal, to, the, common, people, a, style, which, has, also, been, found, in, contemporary, non, jewish, texts, such, as, private, letters, receipts, and, petitions, discovered, in, egypt, where, the, dry, air, has, preserved, these, documents, which, as, everyday, material, not, deemed, of, literary, importance, had, not, been, copied, by, subsequent, generations, the, process, of, canonization, of, the, new, testament, was, complex, and, lengthy, in, the, initial, centuries, of, early, christianity, there, were, many, books, widely, considered, by, the, church, to, be, inspired, but, there, was, no, single, formally, recognized, new, testament, canon, the, process, was, characterized, by, a, compilation, of, books, that, apostolic, tradition, considered, authoritative, in, worship, and, teaching, relevant, to, the, historical, situations, in, which, they, lived, and, consonant, with, the, old, testament, writings, attributed, to, the, apostles, circulated, among, the, earliest, christian, communities, and, the, pauline, epistles, were, circulating, perhaps, in, collected, forms, by, the, end, of, the, 1st, century, ad, one, of, the, earliest, attempts, at, solidifying, a, canon, was, made, by, marcion, c, 140, ad, who, accepted, only, a, modified, version, of, luke, the, gospel, of, marcion, and, ten, of, paul, s, letters, while, rejecting, the, old, testament, entirely, his, canon, was, largely, rejected, by, other, groups, of, christians, notably, the, proto, orthodox, christians, as, was, his, theology, marcionism, adolf, von, harnack, john, knox, and, david, trobisch, among, other, scholars, have, argued, that, the, church, formulated, its, new, testament, canon, partially, in, response, to, the, challenge, posed, by, marcion, polycarp, irenaeus, and, tertullian, held, the, epistles, of, paul, to, be, divinely, inspired, scripture, other, books, were, held, in, high, esteem, but, were, gradually, relegated, to, the, status, of, new, testament, apocrypha, justin, martyr, in, the, mid, 2nd, century, mentions, memoirs, of, the, apostles, as, being, read, on, sunday, alongside, the, writings, of, the, prophets, the, muratorian, fragment, dated, at, between, 170, and, as, late, as, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, according, to, the, anchor, bible, dictionary, may, be, the, earliest, known, new, testament, canon, attributed, to, mainstream, christianity, it, is, similar, but, not, identical, to, the, modern, new, testament, canon, the, oldest, clear, endorsement, of, matthew, mark, luke, and, john, being, the, only, legitimate, gospels, was, written, c, 180, ad, a, four, gospel, canon, the, tetramorph, was, asserted, by, irenaeus, who, refers, to, it, directly, in, his, polemic, against, heresies, it, is, not, possible, that, the, gospels, can, be, either, more, or, fewer, in, number, than, they, are, for, since, there, are, four, zones, of, the, world, in, which, we, live, and, four, principal, winds, while, the, church, is, scattered, throughout, all, the, world, and, the, pillar, and, ground, of, the, church, is, the, gospel, and, the, spirit, of, life, it, is, fitting, that, she, should, have, four, pillars, breathing, out, immortality, on, every, side, and, vivifying, men, afresh, the, books, considered, to, be, authoritative, by, irenaeus, included, the, four, gospels, and, many, of, the, letters, of, paul, although, based, on, the, arguments, irenaeus, made, in, support, of, only, four, authentic, gospels, some, interpreters, deduce, that, the, fourfold, gospel, must, have, still, been, a, novelty, in, irenaeus, s, time, by, the, early, 200s, origen, may, have, been, using, the, same, twenty, seven, books, as, in, the, catholic, new, testament, canon, though, there, were, still, disputes, over, the, canonicity, of, the, letter, to, the, hebrews, epistle, of, james, ii, peter, ii, john, and, iii, john, and, the, book, of, revelation, known, as, the, antilegomena, likewise, the, muratorian, fragment, is, evidence, that, perhaps, as, early, as, 200, there, existed, a, set, of, christian, writings, somewhat, similar, to, the, twenty, seven, book, nt, canon, which, included, four, gospels, and, argued, against, objections, to, them, thus, while, there, was, a, good, measure, of, debate, in, the, early, church, over, the, new, testament, canon, the, major, writings, are, claimed, to, have, been, accepted, by, almost, all, christians, by, the, middle, of, the, 3rd, century, origen, was, largely, responsible, for, the, collection, of, usage, information, regarding, the, texts, that, became, the, new, testament, the, information, used, to, create, the, late, 4th, century, easter, letter, which, declared, accepted, christian, writings, was, probably, based, on, the, ecclesiastical, history, he, of, eusebius, of, caesarea, wherein, he, uses, the, information, passed, on, to, him, by, origen, to, create, both, his, list, at, he, 3, 25, and, origen, s, list, at, he, 6, 25, eusebius, got, his, information, about, what, texts, were, then, accepted, and, what, were, then, disputed, by, the, third, century, churches, throughout, the, known, world, a, great, deal, of, which, origen, knew, of, firsthand, from, his, extensive, travels, from, the, library, and, writings, of, origen, in, fact, origen, would, have, possibly, included, in, his, list, of, inspired, writings, other, texts, kept, out, by, the, likes, of, eusebius, including, the, epistle, of, barnabas, shepherd, of, hermas, and, 1, clement, notwithstanding, these, facts, origen, is, not, the, originator, of, the, idea, of, biblical, canon, but, he, certainly, gives, the, philosophical, and, literary, interpretative, underpinnings, for, the, whole, notion, eusebius, c, 300, gave, a, detailed, list, of, new, testament, writings, in, his, ecclesiastical, history, book, 3, chapter, xxv, the, book, of, revelation, is, counted, as, both, accepted, kirsopp, lake, translation, recognized, and, disputed, which, has, caused, some, confusion, over, what, exactly, eusebius, meant, by, doing, so, from, other, writings, of, the, church, fathers, it, was, disputed, with, several, canon, lists, rejecting, its, canonicity, eh, 3, 3, 5, adds, further, detail, on, paul, paul, s, fourteen, epistles, are, well, known, and, undisputed, it, is, not, indeed, right, to, overlook, the, fact, that, some, have, rejected, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, saying, that, it, is, disputed, by, the, church, of, rome, on, the, ground, that, it, was, not, written, by, paul, eh, 4, 29, 6, mentions, the, diatessaron, but, their, original, founder, tatian, formed, a, certain, combination, and, collection, of, the, gospels, i, know, not, how, to, which, he, gave, the, title, diatessaron, and, which, is, still, in, the, hands, of, some, but, they, say, that, he, ventured, to, paraphrase, certain, words, of, the, apostle, paul, in, order, to, improve, their, style, in, his, easter, letter, of, 367, athanasius, bishop, of, alexandria, gave, a, list, of, the, books, that, would, become, the, twenty, seven, book, nt, canon, and, he, used, the, word, canonized, kanonizomena, in, regards, to, them, the, first, council, that, accepted, the, present, canon, of, the, new, testament, may, have, been, the, synod, of, hippo, regius, in, north, africa, 393, ad, the, acts, of, this, council, are, lost, a, brief, summary, of, the, acts, was, read, at, and, accepted, by, the, council, of, carthage, 397, and, the, council, of, carthage, 419, these, councils, were, under, the, authority, of, st, augustine, who, regarded, the, canon, as, already, closed, pope, damasus, i, s, council, of, rome, in, 382, if, the, decretum, gelasianum, is, correctly, associated, with, it, issued, a, biblical, canon, identical, to, that, mentioned, above, or, if, not, the, list, is, at, least, a, 6th, century, compilation, likewise, damasus, commissioning, of, the, latin, vulgate, edition, of, the, bible, c, 383, was, instrumental, in, the, fixation, of, the, canon, in, the, west, in, c, 405, pope, innocent, i, sent, a, list, of, the, sacred, books, to, a, gallic, bishop, exsuperius, of, toulouse, christian, scholars, assert, that, when, these, bishops, and, councils, spoke, on, the, matter, they, were, not, defining, something, new, but, instead, were, ratifying, what, had, already, become, the, mind, of, the, church, the, new, testament, canon, as, it, is, now, was, first, listed, by, st, athanasius, bishop, of, alexandria, in, 367, in, a, letter, written, to, his, churches, in, egypt, festal, letter, 39, also, cited, is, the, council, of, rome, but, not, without, controversy, that, canon, gained, wider, and, wider, recognition, until, it, was, accepted, at, the, third, council, of, carthage, in, 397, and, 419, the, book, of, revelation, was, not, added, till, the, council, of, carthage, 419, even, this, council, did, not, settle, the, matter, certain, books, referred, to, as, antilegomena, continued, to, be, questioned, especially, james, and, revelation, even, as, late, as, the, 16th, century, the, reformer, martin, luther, questioned, but, in, the, end, did, not, reject, the, epistle, of, james, the, epistle, of, jude, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, and, the, book, of, revelation, to, this, day, german, language, luther, bibles, are, printed, with, these, four, books, at, the, end, of, the, canon, rather, than, in, their, traditional, order, as, in, other, editions, of, the, bible, in, light, of, this, questioning, of, the, canon, of, scripture, by, protestants, in, the, 16th, century, the, roman, catholic, council, of, trent, reaffirmed, the, traditional, western, canon, i, e, the, canon, accepted, at, the, 4th, century, council, of, rome, and, council, of, carthage, thus, making, the, canon, of, trent, and, the, vulgate, bible, dogma, in, the, catholic, church, later, pope, pius, xi, on, 2, june, 1927, decreed, the, comma, johanneum, was, open, to, dispute, and, pope, pius, xii, on, 3, september, 1943, issued, the, encyclical, divino, afflante, spiritu, which, allowed, translations, based, on, other, versions, than, just, the, latin, vulgate, notably, in, english, the, new, american, bible, thus, some, claim, that, from, the, 4th, century, there, existed, unanimity, in, the, west, concerning, the, new, testament, canon, as, it, is, today, and, that, by, the, 5th, century, the, eastern, church, with, a, few, exceptions, had, come, to, accept, the, book, of, revelation, and, thus, had, come, into, harmony, on, the, matter, of, the, canon, nonetheless, full, dogmatic, articulations, of, the, canon, were, not, made, until, the, canon, of, trent, of, 1546, for, roman, catholicism, the, thirty, nine, articles, of, 1563, for, the, church, of, england, the, westminster, confession, of, faith, of, 1647, for, calvinism, and, the, synod, of, jerusalem, of, 1672, for, the, greek, orthodox, on, the, question, of, nt, canon, formation, generally, new, testament, scholar, lee, martin, mcdonald, has, written, that, although, a, number, of, christians, have, thought, that, church, councils, determined, what, books, were, to, be, included, in, the, biblical, canons, a, more, accurate, reflection, of, the, matter, is, that, the, councils, recognized, or, acknowledged, those, books, that, had, already, obtained, prominence, from, usage, among, the, various, early, christian, communities, according, to, the, catholic, encyclopedia, article, on, the, canon, of, the, new, testament, the, idea, of, a, complete, and, clear, cut, canon, of, the, new, testament, existing, from, the, beginning, that, is, from, apostolic, times, has, no, foundation, in, history, the, canon, of, the, new, testament, like, that, of, the, old, is, the, result, of, a, development, of, a, process, at, once, stimulated, by, disputes, with, doubters, both, within, and, without, the, church, and, retarded, by, certain, obscurities, and, natural, hesitations, and, which, did, not, reach, its, final, term, until, the, dogmatic, definition, of, the, tridentine, council, in, 331, constantine, i, commissioned, eusebius, to, deliver, fifty, bibles, for, the, church, of, constantinople, athanasius, apol, const, 4, recorded, alexandrian, scribes, around, 340, preparing, bibles, for, constans, little, else, is, known, though, there, is, plenty, of, speculation, for, example, it, is, speculated, that, this, may, have, provided, motivation, for, canon, lists, and, that, codex, vaticanus, and, codex, sinaiticus, may, be, examples, of, these, bibles, together, with, the, peshitta, and, codex, alexandrinus, these, are, the, earliest, extant, christian, bibles, there, is, no, evidence, among, the, canons, of, the, first, council, of, nicaea, of, any, determination, on, the, canon, like, other, literature, from, antiquity, the, text, of, the, new, testament, was, prior, to, the, advent, of, the, printing, press, preserved, and, transmitted, in, manuscripts, manuscripts, containing, at, least, a, part, of, the, new, testament, number, in, the, thousands, the, earliest, of, these, like, manuscripts, containing, other, literature, are, often, very, fragmentarily, preserved, some, of, these, fragments, have, even, been, thought, to, date, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, i, e, papyrus, 90, papyrus, 98, papyrus, 104, and, famously, rylands, library, papyrus, p52, though, the, early, date, of, the, latter, has, recently, been, called, into, question, for, each, subsequent, century, more, and, more, manuscripts, survive, that, contain, a, portion, or, all, of, the, books, that, were, held, to, be, part, of, the, new, testament, at, that, time, for, example, the, new, testament, of, the, 4th, century, codex, sinaiticus, once, a, complete, bible, contains, the, epistle, of, barnabas, and, the, shepherd, of, hermas, though, occasionally, these, manuscripts, contain, other, works, as, well, e, g, papyrus, 72, and, the, crosby, sch, yen, codex, the, date, when, a, manuscript, was, written, does, not, necessarily, reflect, the, date, of, the, form, of, text, it, contains, that, is, later, manuscripts, can, and, occasionally, do, contain, older, forms, of, text, or, older, readings, some, of, the, more, important, manuscripts, containing, an, early, text, of, books, of, the, new, testament, are, textual, criticism, deals, with, the, identification, and, removal, of, transcription, errors, in, the, texts, of, manuscripts, ancient, scribes, made, errors, or, alterations, such, as, including, non, authentic, additions, the, new, testament, has, been, preserved, in, more, than, 5, 800, greek, manuscripts, 10, 000, latin, manuscripts, and, 9, 300, manuscripts, in, various, other, ancient, languages, including, syriac, slavic, ethiopic, and, armenian, even, if, the, original, greek, versions, were, lost, the, entire, new, testament, could, still, be, assembled, from, the, translations, in, addition, there, are, so, many, quotes, from, the, new, testament, in, early, church, documents, and, commentaries, that, the, entire, new, testament, could, also, be, assembled, from, these, alone, not, all, biblical, manuscripts, come, from, orthodox, christian, writers, for, example, the, gnostic, writings, of, valentinus, come, from, the, 2nd, century, ad, and, these, christians, were, regarded, as, heretics, by, the, mainstream, church, the, sheer, number, of, witnesses, presents, unique, difficulties, but, it, also, gives, scholars, a, better, idea, of, how, close, modern, bibles, are, to, the, original, versions, on, noting, the, large, number, of, surviving, ancient, manuscripts, bruce, metzger, sums, up, the, view, on, the, issue, by, saying, the, more, often, you, have, copies, that, agree, with, each, other, especially, if, they, emerge, from, different, geographical, areas, the, more, you, can, cross, check, them, to, figure, out, what, the, original, document, was, like, the, only, way, they, d, agree, would, be, where, they, went, back, genealogically, in, a, family, tree, that, represents, the, descent, of, the, manuscripts, in, attempting, to, determine, the, original, text, of, the, new, testament, books, some, modern, textual, critics, have, identified, sections, as, additions, of, material, centuries, after, the, gospel, was, written, these, are, called, interpolations, in, modern, translations, of, the, bible, the, results, of, textual, criticism, have, led, to, certain, verses, words, and, phrases, being, left, out, or, marked, as, not, original, according, to, bart, d, ehrman, these, scribal, additions, are, often, found, in, late, medieval, manuscripts, of, the, new, testament, but, not, in, the, manuscripts, of, the, earlier, centuries, most, modern, bibles, have, footnotes, to, indicate, passages, that, have, disputed, source, documents, bible, commentaries, also, discuss, these, sometimes, in, great, detail, while, many, variations, have, been, discovered, between, early, copies, of, biblical, texts, almost, all, have, no, importance, as, they, are, variations, in, spelling, punctuation, or, grammar, also, many, of, these, variants, are, so, particular, to, the, greek, language, that, they, would, not, appear, in, translations, into, other, languages, for, example, order, of, words, i, e, man, bites, dog, versus, dog, bites, man, often, does, not, matter, in, greek, so, textual, variants, that, flip, the, order, of, words, often, have, no, consequences, outside, of, these, unimportant, variants, there, are, a, couple, variants, of, some, importance, the, two, most, commonly, cited, examples, are, the, last, verses, of, the, gospel, of, mark, and, the, story, of, jesus, and, the, woman, taken, in, adultery, in, the, gospel, of, john, many, scholars, and, critics, also, believe, that, the, johannine, comma, reference, supporting, the, trinity, doctrine, in, the, first, epistle, of, john, to, have, been, a, later, addition, according, to, norman, geisler, and, william, nix, the, new, testament, then, has, not, only, survived, in, more, manuscripts, than, any, other, book, from, antiquity, but, it, has, survived, in, a, purer, form, than, any, other, great, book, a, form, that, is, 99, 5, pure, the, often, referred, to, interpreter, s, dictionary, of, the, bible, a, book, written, to, prove, the, validity, of, the, new, testament, says, a, study, of, 150, greek, of, the, gospel, of, luke, has, revealed, more, than, 30, 000, different, readings, it, is, safe, to, say, that, there, is, not, one, sentence, in, the, new, testament, in, which, the, is, wholly, uniform, most, of, the, variation, took, place, within, the, first, three, christian, centuries, by, the, 4th, century, textual, families, or, types, of, text, become, discernible, among, new, testament, manuscripts, a, text, type, is, the, name, given, to, a, family, of, texts, with, similar, readings, due, to, common, ancestors, and, mutual, correction, many, early, manuscripts, contain, individual, readings, from, several, different, earlier, forms, of, text, modern, textual, critics, have, identified, the, following, text, types, among, textual, witnesses, to, the, new, testament, the, alexandrian, text, type, is, usually, considered, to, generally, preserve, many, early, readings, it, is, represented, e, g, by, codex, vaticanus, codex, sinaiticus, and, the, bodmer, papyri, the, western, text, type, is, generally, longer, and, can, be, paraphrastic, but, can, also, preserve, early, readings, the, western, version, of, the, acts, of, the, apostles, is, notably, 8, 5, longer, than, the, alexandrian, form, of, the, text, examples, of, the, western, text, are, found, in, codex, bezae, codex, claromontanus, codex, washingtonianus, the, old, latin, i, e, latin, translations, made, prior, to, the, vulgate, as, well, as, in, quotations, by, marcion, tatian, irenaeus, tertullian, and, cyprian, a, text, type, referred, to, as, the, caesarean, text, type, and, thought, to, have, included, witnesses, such, as, codex, koridethi, and, minuscule, 565, can, today, be, described, neither, as, caesarean, nor, as, a, text, type, as, was, previously, thought, the, gospel, of, mark, in, papyrus, 45, codex, washingtonianus, and, in, family, 13, reflects, a, distinct, type, of, text, increasing, standardization, of, distinct, and, once, local, text, types, eventually, gave, rise, to, the, byzantine, text, type, since, most, manuscripts, of, the, new, testament, do, not, derive, from, the, first, several, centuries, that, is, they, were, copied, after, the, rise, of, the, byzantine, text, type, this, form, of, text, is, found, the, majority, of, extant, manuscripts, and, is, therefore, often, called, the, majority, text, as, with, all, of, the, other, earlier, text, types, the, byzantine, can, also, occasionally, preserve, early, readings, biblical, criticism, is, the, scholarly, study, and, investigation, of, biblical, writings, that, seeks, to, make, discerning, judgments, about, these, writings, viewing, biblical, texts, as, having, human, rather, than, supernatural, origins, it, asks, when, and, where, a, particular, text, originated, how, why, by, whom, for, whom, and, in, what, circumstances, it, was, produced, what, influences, were, at, work, in, its, production, what, sources, were, used, in, its, composition, and, what, message, it, was, intended, to, convey, it, will, vary, slightly, depending, on, whether, the, focus, is, on, the, old, testament, the, letters, of, the, new, testament, or, the, canonical, gospels, it, also, plays, an, important, role, in, the, quest, for, the, historical, jesus, it, also, addresses, the, physical, text, including, the, meaning, of, the, words, and, the, way, in, which, they, are, used, its, preservation, history, and, integrity, biblical, criticism, draws, upon, a, wide, range, of, scholarly, disciplines, including, archaeology, anthropology, folklore, linguistics, narrative, criticism, oral, tradition, studies, history, and, religious, studies, the, textual, variation, among, manuscript, copies, of, books, in, the, new, testament, prompted, attempts, to, discern, the, earliest, form, of, text, already, in, antiquity, e, g, by, the, 3rd, century, christian, author, origen, the, efforts, began, in, earnest, again, during, the, renaissance, which, saw, a, revival, of, the, study, of, ancient, greek, texts, during, this, period, modern, textual, criticism, was, born, in, this, context, christian, humanists, such, as, lorenzo, valla, and, erasmus, promoted, a, return, to, the, original, greek, of, the, new, testament, this, was, the, beginning, of, modern, new, testament, textual, criticism, which, over, subsequent, centuries, would, increasingly, incorporate, more, and, more, manuscripts, in, more, languages, i, e, versions, of, the, new, testament, as, well, as, citations, of, the, new, testament, by, ancient, authors, and, the, new, testament, text, in, lectionaries, in, order, to, reconstruct, the, earliest, recoverable, form, of, the, new, testament, text, and, the, history, of, changes, to, it, books, that, later, formed, the, new, testament, like, other, christian, literature, of, the, period, originated, in, a, literary, context, that, reveals, relationships, not, only, to, other, christian, writings, but, also, to, graeco, roman, and, jewish, works, of, singular, importance, is, the, extensive, use, of, and, interaction, with, the, jewish, bible, and, what, would, become, the, christian, old, testament, both, implicit, and, explicit, citations, as, well, as, countless, allusions, appear, throughout, the, books, of, the, new, testament, from, the, gospels, and, acts, to, the, epistles, to, the, apocalypse, the, first, translations, usually, called, versions, of, the, new, testament, were, made, beginning, already, at, the, end, of, 2nd, century, the, earliest, versions, of, the, new, testament, are, the, translations, into, the, syriac, latin, and, coptic, languages, these, three, versions, were, made, directly, from, the, greek, and, are, frequently, cited, in, the, apparatuses, of, modern, critical, editions, syriac, is, an, eastern, middle, aramaic, spoken, in, syria, and, upper, mesopotamia, a, cousin, the, western, middle, aramaic, language, known, as, jewish, palestinian, aramaic, was, spoken, in, roman, and, byzantine, palestine, several, syriac, translations, were, made, and, have, come, to, us, most, of, the, old, syriac, and, philoxonian, versions, have, been, lost, tatian, created, the, diatessaron, a, gospel, harmony, written, in, syriac, around, 170, and, the, earliest, form, of, the, gospel, not, only, in, syriac, but, probably, also, in, armenian, in, the, 19th, century, manuscript, evidence, was, discovered, for, an, old, syriac, version, of, the, four, distinct, i, e, not, harmonized, gospels, these, separated, gospels, classical, syriac, romanized, ewangelion, da, mp, arra, though, old, are, later, than, the, diatessaron, the, old, syriac, gospels, are, fragmentarily, preserved, in, two, manuscripts, the, fifth, century, curetonian, gospels, and, the, syriac, sinaiticus, from, the, fourth, or, fourth, century, no, old, syriac, manuscripts, of, other, portions, of, the, new, testament, survive, though, old, syriac, readings, e, g, from, the, pauline, epistles, can, be, discerned, in, citations, made, by, eastern, fathers, and, in, later, syriac, versions, the, old, syriac, version, is, a, representative, of, the, western, text, type, the, peshitta, version, was, prepared, in, the, beginning, of, the, fifth, century, it, contains, only, 22, books, neither, the, catholic, epistles, second, epistle, of, peter, the, second, and, third, epistle, of, john, and, the, epistle, of, jude, nor, the, book, of, revelation, were, part, of, this, translation, the, philoxenian, probably, was, produced, in, 508, for, bishop, philoxenus, of, mabbug, the, gospels, were, likely, translated, into, latin, as, early, as, the, last, quarter, of, the, 2nd, century, in, north, africa, afra, not, much, later, there, were, also, european, latin, translations, itala, there, are, about, 80, old, latin, manuscripts, the, vetus, latina, old, latin, versions, often, contain, readings, with, a, western, type, of, text, for, the, avoidance, of, confusion, these, texts, were, written, in, late, latin, not, the, early, version, of, the, latin, language, known, as, old, latin, pre, 75, bc, the, bewildering, diversity, of, the, old, latin, versions, prompted, jerome, to, prepare, another, translation, into, latin, the, vulgate, in, many, respects, it, was, merely, a, revision, of, the, old, latin, there, are, currently, around, 8, 000, manuscripts, of, the, vulgate, there, are, several, dialects, of, the, coptic, language, bohairic, the, nile, delta, fayyumic, in, the, faiyum, in, middle, egypt, sahidic, in, upper, egypt, akhmimic, what, is, now, sohag, governorate, in, upper, egypt, and, others, the, first, translation, was, made, by, at, least, the, third, century, into, the, sahidic, dialect, cop, sa, this, translation, represents, a, mixed, text, mostly, alexandrian, though, also, with, western, readings, a, bohairic, translation, was, made, later, but, existed, already, in, the, 4th, century, though, the, translation, makes, less, use, of, greek, words, than, the, sahidic, it, does, employ, some, greek, grammar, e, g, in, word, order, and, the, use, of, particles, such, as, the, syntactic, construction, for, this, reason, the, bohairic, translation, can, be, helpful, in, the, reconstruction, of, the, early, greek, text, of, the, new, testament, the, continued, spread, of, christianity, and, the, foundation, of, national, churches, led, to, the, translation, of, the, bible, often, beginning, with, books, from, the, new, testament, into, a, variety, of, other, languages, at, a, relatively, early, date, armenian, georgian, ethiopic, persian, sogdian, and, eventually, gothic, old, church, slavonic, arabic, and, nubian, historically, throughout, the, christian, world, and, in, the, context, of, christian, missionary, activity, the, new, testament, or, portions, thereof, has, been, that, part, of, the, christian, bible, first, translated, into, the, vernacular, the, production, of, such, translations, grew, out, of, the, insertion, of, vernacular, glosses, in, biblical, texts, as, well, as, out, of, the, production, of, biblical, paraphrases, and, poetic, renditions, of, stories, from, the, life, of, christ, e, g, the, heliand, the, 16th, century, saw, the, rise, of, protestantism, and, an, explosion, of, translations, of, the, new, and, old, testament, into, the, vernacular, notable, are, those, of, martin, luther, 1522, jacques, lef, vre, d, taples, 1523, the, froschau, bible, 1525, 1529, revised, in, 1574, william, tyndale, 1526, revised, in, 1534, 1535, and, 1536, the, brest, bible, 1563, and, the, authorized, version, also, called, the, king, james, version, 1611, most, of, these, translations, relied, though, not, always, exclusively, upon, one, of, the, printed, editions, of, the, greek, new, testament, edited, by, erasmus, the, novum, instrumentum, omne, a, form, of, this, greek, text, emerged, as, the, standard, and, is, known, as, the, textus, receptus, this, text, based, on, the, majority, of, manuscripts, is, also, used, in, the, majority, of, translations, that, were, made, in, the, years, 100, to, 400, ad, translations, of, the, new, testament, made, since, the, appearance, of, critical, editions, of, the, greek, text, notably, those, of, tischendorf, westcott, and, hort, and, von, soden, have, largely, used, them, as, their, base, text, unlike, the, textus, receptus, these, have, a, pronounced, alexandrian, character, standard, critical, editions, are, those, of, nestle, land, the, text, though, not, the, full, critical, apparatus, of, which, is, reproduced, in, the, united, bible, societies, greek, new, testament, souter, vogels, bover, and, merk, notable, translations, of, the, new, testament, based, on, these, most, recent, critical, editions, include, the, revised, standard, version, 1946, revised, in, 1971, la, bible, de, j, rusalem, 1961, revised, in, 1973, and, 2000, the, einheits, bersetzung, 1970, final, edition, 1979, the, new, american, bible, 1970, revised, in, 1986, and, 2011, the, new, international, version, 1973, revised, in, 1984, and, 2011, the, traduction, oecum, nique, de, la, bible, 1988, revised, in, 2004, the, new, revised, standard, version, 1989, and, the, english, standard, version, 2001, revised, in, 2007, 2011, and, 2016, though, all, christian, churches, accept, the, new, testament, as, scripture, they, differ, in, their, understanding, of, the, nature, extent, and, relevance, of, its, authority, views, of, the, authoritativeness, of, the, new, testament, often, depend, on, the, concept, of, inspiration, which, relates, to, the, role, of, god, in, the, formation, of, the, new, testament, generally, the, greater, the, role, of, god, in, one, s, doctrine, of, inspiration, the, more, one, accepts, the, doctrine, of, biblical, inerrancy, or, authoritativeness, of, the, bible, one, possible, source, of, confusion, is, that, these, terms, are, difficult, to, define, because, many, people, use, them, interchangeably, or, with, very, different, meanings, this, article, will, use, the, terms, in, the, following, manner, according, to, gary, t, meadors, the, self, witness, of, the, bible, to, its, inspiration, demands, a, commitment, to, its, unity, the, ultimate, basis, for, unity, is, contained, in, the, claim, of, divine, inspiration, in, 2, timothy, 3, 16, that, all, scripture, is, given, by, inspiration, of, god, and, is, profitable, for, doctrine, for, reproof, for, correction, for, instruction, in, righteousness, kjv, the, term, inspiration, renders, the, greek, word, theopneustos, this, term, only, occurs, here, in, the, new, testament, and, literally, means, god, breathed, the, chosen, translation, of, the, niv, all, of, these, concepts, depend, for, their, meaning, on, the, supposition, that, the, text, of, bible, has, been, properly, interpreted, with, consideration, for, the, intention, of, the, text, whether, literal, history, allegory, or, poetry, etc, especially, the, doctrine, of, inerrancy, is, variously, understood, according, to, the, weight, given, by, the, interpreter, to, scientific, investigations, of, the, world, the, notion, of, unity, in, diversity, of, scripture, claims, that, the, bible, presents, a, noncontradictory, and, consistent, message, concerning, god, and, redemptive, history, the, fact, of, diversity, is, observed, in, comparing, the, diversity, of, time, culture, authors, perspectives, literary, genre, and, the, theological, themes, studies, from, many, theologians, considering, the, unity, in, diversity, to, be, found, in, the, new, testament, and, the, bible, as, a, whole, have, been, collected, and, summarized, by, new, testament, theologian, frank, stagg, he, describes, them, as, some, basic, presuppositions, tenets, and, concerns, common, among, the, new, testament, writers, giving, to, the, new, testament, its, unity, in, diversity, for, the, roman, catholic, church, there, are, two, modes, of, revelation, scripture, and, tradition, both, of, them, are, interpreted, by, the, teachings, of, the, church, the, roman, catholic, view, is, expressed, clearly, in, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, 1997, 82, as, a, result, the, church, to, whom, the, transmission, and, interpretation, of, revelation, is, entrusted, does, not, derive, her, certainty, about, all, revealed, truths, from, the, holy, scriptures, alone, both, scripture, and, tradition, must, be, accepted, and, honoured, with, equal, sentiments, of, devotion, and, reverence, 107, the, inspired, books, teach, the, truth, since, therefore, all, that, the, inspired, authors, or, sacred, writers, affirm, should, be, regarded, as, affirmed, by, the, holy, spirit, we, must, acknowledge, that, the, books, of, scripture, firmly, faithfully, and, without, error, teach, that, truth, which, god, for, the, sake, of, our, salvation, wished, to, see, confided, to, the, sacred, scriptures, in, catholic, terminology, the, teaching, office, is, called, the, magisterium, the, catholic, view, should, not, be, confused, with, the, two, source, theory, as, the, catechism, states, in, 80, and, 81, revelation, has, one, common, source, two, distinct, modes, of, transmission, while, many, eastern, orthodox, writers, distinguish, between, scripture, and, tradition, bishop, kallistos, ware, says, that, for, the, orthodox, there, is, only, one, source, of, the, christian, faith, holy, tradition, within, which, scripture, exists, traditional, anglicans, believe, that, holy, scripture, containeth, all, things, necessary, to, salvation, article, vi, but, also, that, the, catholic, creeds, ought, thoroughly, to, be, received, and, believed, article, viii, and, that, the, church, hath, authority, in, controversies, of, faith, and, is, a, witness, and, keeper, of, holy, writ, article, xx, classical, anglicanism, therefore, like, orthodoxy, holds, that, holy, tradition, is, the, only, safe, guardian, against, perversion, and, innovation, in, the, interpretation, of, scripture, in, the, famous, words, of, thomas, ken, bishop, of, bath, and, wells, as, for, my, religion, i, dye, in, the, holy, catholic, and, apostolic, faith, professed, by, the, whole, church, before, the, disunion, of, east, and, west, more, particularly, in, the, communion, of, the, church, of, england, as, it, stands, distinguished, from, all, papal, and, puritan, innovations, and, as, it, adheres, to, the, doctrine, of, the, cross, following, the, doctrine, of, sola, scriptura, protestants, believe, that, their, traditions, of, faith, practice, and, interpretations, carry, forward, what, the, scriptures, teach, and, so, tradition, is, not, a, source, of, authority, in, itself, their, traditions, derive, authority, from, the, bible, and, are, therefore, always, open, to, reevaluation, this, openness, to, doctrinal, revision, has, extended, in, liberal, protestant, traditions, even, to, the, reevaluation, of, the, doctrine, of, scripture, upon, which, the, reformation, was, founded, and, members, of, these, traditions, may, even, question, whether, the, bible, is, infallible, in, doctrine, inerrant, in, historical, and, other, factual, statements, and, whether, it, has, uniquely, divine, authority, the, adjustments, made, by, modern, protestants, to, their, doctrine, of, scripture, vary, widely, within, the, us, the, chicago, statement, on, biblical, inerrancy, 1978, articulates, evangelical, views, on, this, issue, paragraph, four, of, its, summary, states, being, wholly, and, verbally, god, given, scripture, is, without, error, or, fault, in, all, its, teaching, no, less, in, what, it, states, about, god, s, acts, in, creation, about, the, events, of, world, history, and, about, its, own, literary, origins, under, god, than, in, its, witness, to, god, s, saving, grace, in, individual, lives, mainline, american, protestant, denominations, including, the, united, methodist, church, presbyterian, church, usa, the, episcopal, church, and, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, do, not, teach, the, doctrine, of, inerrancy, as, set, forth, in, the, chicago, statement, all, of, these, churches, have, more, ancient, doctrinal, statements, asserting, the, authority, of, scripture, but, may, interpret, these, statements, in, such, a, way, as, to, allow, for, a, very, broad, range, of, teaching, from, evangelicalism, to, skepticism, it, is, not, an, impediment, to, ordination, in, these, denominations, to, teach, that, the, scriptures, contain, errors, or, that, the, authors, follow, a, more, or, less, unenlightened, ethics, that, however, appropriate, it, may, have, seemed, in, the, authors, time, moderns, would, be, very, wrong, to, follow, blindly, for, example, ordination, of, women, is, universally, accepted, in, the, mainline, churches, abortion, is, condemned, as, a, grievous, social, tragedy, but, not, always, a, personal, sin, or, a, crime, against, an, unborn, person, and, homosexuality, is, sometimes, recognized, as, a, genetic, propensity, or, morally, neutral, preference, that, should, be, neither, encouraged, nor, condemned, in, north, america, the, most, contentious, of, these, issues, among, these, churches, at, the, present, time, is, how, far, the, ordination, of, gay, men, and, lesbians, should, be, accepted, officials, of, the, presbyterian, church, usa, report, we, acknowledge, the, role, of, scriptural, authority, in, the, presbyterian, church, but, presbyterians, generally, do, not, believe, in, biblical, inerrancy, presbyterians, do, not, insist, that, every, detail, of, chronology, or, sequence, or, prescientific, description, in, scripture, be, true, in, literal, form, our, confessions, do, teach, biblical, infallibility, infallibility, affirms, the, entire, truthfulness, of, scripture, without, depending, on, every, exact, detail, those, who, hold, a, more, liberal, view, of, the, bible, as, a, human, witness, to, the, glory, of, god, the, work, of, fallible, humans, who, wrote, from, a, limited, experience, unusual, only, for, the, insight, they, have, gained, through, their, inspired, struggle, to, know, god, in, the, midst, of, a, troubled, world, therefore, they, tend, not, to, accept, such, doctrines, as, inerrancy, these, churches, also, tend, to, retain, the, social, activism, of, their, evangelical, forebears, of, the, 19th, century, placing, particular, emphasis, on, those, teachings, of, scripture, that, teach, compassion, for, the, poor, and, concern, for, social, justice, the, message, of, personal, salvation, is, generally, speaking, of, the, good, that, comes, to, oneself, and, the, world, through, following, the, new, testament, s, golden, rule, admonition, to, love, others, without, hypocrisy, or, prejudice, toward, these, ends, the, spirit, of, the, new, testament, more, than, the, letter, is, infallible, and, authoritative, there, are, some, movements, that, believe, the, bible, contains, the, teachings, of, jesus, but, who, reject, the, churches, that, were, formed, following, its, publication, these, people, believe, all, individuals, can, communicate, directly, with, god, and, therefore, do, not, need, guidance, or, doctrines, from, a, church, these, people, are, known, as, christian, anarchists, messianic, judaism, generally, holds, the, same, view, of, new, testament, authority, as, evangelical, protestants, according, to, the, view, of, some, messianic, jewish, congregations, jesus, did, not, annul, the, torah, but, that, its, interpretation, is, revised, and, ultimately, explained, through, the, apostolic, scriptures, jehovah, s, witnesses, accept, the, new, testament, as, divinely, inspired, scripture, and, as, infallible, in, every, detail, with, equal, authority, as, the, hebrew, scriptures, they, view, it, as, the, written, revelation, and, good, news, of, the, messiah, the,

the, inspired, word, of, god, and, as, absolutely, inerrant, in, its, contents, though, not, necessarily, in, every, translation, they, regard, the, new, testament, as, perfect, and, inerrant, in, every, way, revealing, the, lord, jesus, christ, in, the, flesh, and, his, atonement, and, which, also, explains, and, illuminates, the, old, testament, perfectly, and, is, part, of, the, bible,

of, god, with, god, influencing, the, thoughts, of, the, apostles, in, the, writing, not, necessarily, every, word, though, the, first, fundamental, belief, of, the, seventh, day, adventist, church,

concerning, the, sabbath, is, as, applicable, to, christian, believers, as, the, other, nine, adventists, have, often, taught, a, distinction, between, moral, law, and, ceremonial, law, according, to, adventist, beliefs, the, moral, law, continues, into, the, new, testament, era, but, the, ceremonial, law, was, done, away, with, by, jesus, how, the, mosaic, law, should, be, applied, came, up, at,

law, but, rather, the, wrong, use, of, the, law, legalism, they, were, opposed, by, uriah, smith, and, george, butler, at, the, 1888, conference, smith, in, particular, thought, the, galatians, issue,

transcription, and, translation, have, introduced, errors, into, the, texts, as, currently, available, and, therefore, they, cannot, be, regarded, as, completely, inerrant, in, addition, to, the, old,
