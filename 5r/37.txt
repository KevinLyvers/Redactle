nihilism, n, a, h, l, z, m, n, i, from, latin, nihil, nothing, is, a, philosophical, approach, that, rejects, the, absolute, validity, of, commonly, accepted, or, fundamental, aspects, of, human, existence, such, as, knowledge, morality, or, meaning, while, not, directing, towards, any, specific, conclusion, such, as, the, rejection, of, values, although, thinkers, like, nietzsche, have, tried, to, define, nihilism, through, extreme, outcomes, such, interpretations, reflect, not, nihilism, itself, but, rather, the, perspectives, of, those, who, oppose, it, in, this, context, definitions, by, philosophers, such, as, crosby, 1998, and, deleuze, 1962, focus, on, extreme, critiques, of, nihilism, such, as, knowledge, morality, or, meaning, the, term, was, popularized, by, ivan, turgenev, and, more, specifically, by, his, character, bazarov, in, the, novel, fathers, and, sons, there, have, been, different, nihilist, positions, including, that, human, values, are, baseless, that, life, is, meaningless, that, knowledge, is, impossible, or, that, some, set, of, entities, does, not, exist, or, is, meaningless, or, pointless, scholars, of, nihilism, may, regard, it, as, merely, a, label, that, has, been, applied, to, various, separate, philosophies, or, as, a, distinct, historical, concept, arising, out, of, nominalism, skepticism, and, philosophical, pessimism, as, well, as, possibly, out, of, christianity, itself, contemporary, understanding, of, the, idea, stems, largely, from, the, nietzschean, crisis, of, nihilism, from, which, derive, the, two, central, concepts, the, destruction, of, higher, values, and, the, opposition, to, the, affirmation, of, life, earlier, forms, of, nihilism, however, may, be, more, selective, in, negating, specific, hegemonies, of, social, moral, political, and, aesthetic, thought, the, term, is, sometimes, used, in, association, with, anomie, to, explain, the, general, mood, of, despair, at, a, perceived, pointlessness, of, existence, or, arbitrariness, of, human, principles, and, social, institutions, nihilism, has, also, been, described, as, conspicuous, in, or, constitutive, of, certain, historical, periods, for, example, jean, baudrillard, and, others, have, characterized, postmodernity, as, a, nihilistic, epoch, or, mode, of, thought, likewise, some, theologians, and, religious, figures, have, stated, that, postmodernity, and, many, aspects, of, modernity, represent, nihilism, by, a, negation, of, religious, principles, nihilism, has, however, been, widely, ascribed, to, both, religious, and, irreligious, viewpoints, in, popular, use, the, term, commonly, refers, to, forms, of, existential, nihilism, according, to, which, life, is, without, intrinsic, value, meaning, or, purpose, other, prominent, positions, within, nihilism, include, the, rejection, of, all, normative, and, ethical, views, moral, nihilism, the, rejection, of, all, social, and, political, institutions, political, nihilism, the, stance, that, no, knowledge, can, or, does, exist, epistemological, nihilism, and, a, number, of, metaphysical, positions, which, assert, that, non, abstract, objects, do, not, exist, metaphysical, nihilism, that, composite, objects, do, not, exist, mereological, nihilism, or, even, that, life, itself, does, not, exist, the, etymological, origin, of, nihilism, is, the, latin, root, word, nihil, meaning, nothing, which, is, similarly, found, in, the, related, terms, annihilate, meaning, to, bring, to, nothing, and, nihility, meaning, nothingness, the, term, nihilism, emerged, in, several, places, in, europe, during, the, 18th, century, notably, in, the, german, form, nihilismus, though, was, also, in, use, during, the, middle, ages, to, denote, certain, forms, of, heresy, the, concept, itself, first, took, shape, within, russian, and, german, philosophy, which, respectively, represented, the, two, major, currents, of, discourse, on, nihilism, prior, to, the, 20th, century, the, term, likely, entered, english, from, either, the, german, nihilismus, late, latin, nihilismus, or, french, nihilisme, early, examples, of, the, term, s, use, are, found, in, german, publications, in, 1733, german, writer, friedrich, leberecht, goetz, used, it, as, a, literary, term, in, combination, with, noism, german, neinismus, in, the, period, surrounding, the, french, revolution, the, term, was, also, a, pejorative, for, certain, value, destructive, trends, of, modernity, namely, the, negation, of, christianity, and, european, tradition, in, general, nihilism, first, entered, philosophical, study, within, a, discourse, surrounding, kantian, and, post, kantian, philosophies, notably, appearing, in, the, writings, of, swiss, esotericist, jacob, hermann, obereit, in, 1787, and, german, philosopher, friedrich, heinrich, jacobi, in, 1799, as, early, as, 1824, the, term, began, to, take, on, a, social, connotation, with, german, journalist, joseph, von, g, rres, attributing, it, to, a, negation, of, existing, social, and, political, institutions, the, russian, form, of, the, word, nigilizm, russian, entered, publication, in, 1829, when, nikolai, nadezhdin, used, it, synonymously, with, skepticism, in, russian, journalism, the, word, continued, to, have, significant, social, connotations, from, the, time, of, jacobi, the, term, almost, fell, completely, out, of, use, throughout, europe, until, it, was, revived, by, russian, author, ivan, turgenev, who, brought, the, word, into, popular, use, with, his, 1862, novel, fathers, and, sons, leading, many, scholars, to, believe, he, coined, the, term, the, nihilist, characters, of, the, novel, define, themselves, as, those, who, deny, everything, who, do, not, take, any, principle, on, faith, whatever, reverence, that, principle, may, be, enshrined, in, and, who, regard, at, the, present, time, negation, is, the, most, useful, of, all, despite, turgenev, s, own, anti, nihilistic, leanings, many, of, his, readers, likewise, took, up, the, name, of, nihilist, thus, ascribing, the, russian, nihilist, movement, its, name, nihilism, was, further, discussed, by, german, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, who, used, the, term, to, describe, the, western, world, s, disintegration, of, traditional, morality, for, nietzsche, nihilism, applied, to, both, the, modern, trends, of, value, destruction, expressed, in, the, death, of, god, as, well, as, what, he, saw, as, the, life, denying, morality, of, christianity, under, nietzsche, s, profound, influence, the, term, was, then, further, treated, within, french, philosophy, and, continental, philosophy, more, broadly, while, the, influence, of, nihilism, in, russia, arguably, continued, well, into, the, soviet, era, religious, scholars, such, as, altizer, have, stated, that, nihilism, must, necessarily, be, understood, in, relation, to, religion, and, that, the, study, of, core, elements, of, its, character, requires, fundamentally, theological, consideration, the, concept, of, nihilism, was, discussed, by, the, buddha, 563, bc, to, 483, bc, as, recorded, in, the, theravada, and, mahayana, tripi, aka, the, tripi, aka, originally, written, in, pali, refers, to, nihilism, as, natthikav, da, and, the, nihilist, view, as, micch, di, hi, various, sutras, within, it, describe, a, multiplicity, of, views, held, by, different, sects, of, ascetics, while, the, buddha, was, alive, some, of, which, were, viewed, by, him, to, be, morally, nihilistic, in, the, doctrine, of, nihilism, in, the, apannaka, sutta, the, buddha, describes, moral, nihilists, as, holding, the, following, views, the, buddha, further, states, that, those, who, hold, these, views, will, fail, to, see, the, virtue, in, good, mental, verbal, and, bodily, conduct, and, the, corresponding, dangers, in, misconduct, and, will, therefore, tend, towards, the, latter, the, culmination, of, the, path, that, the, buddha, taught, was, nirvana, a, place, of, nothingness, nonpossession, and, non, attachment, the, total, end, of, death, and, decay, ajahn, amaro, an, ordained, buddhist, monk, of, more, than, 40, years, observes, that, in, english, nothingness, can, sound, like, nihilism, however, the, word, could, be, emphasized, in, a, different, way, so, that, it, becomes, no, thingness, indicating, that, nirvana, is, not, a, thing, you, can, find, but, rather, a, state, where, you, experience, the, reality, of, non, grasping, in, the, alagaddupama, sutta, the, buddha, describes, how, some, individuals, feared, his, teaching, because, they, believe, that, their, self, would, be, destroyed, if, they, followed, it, he, describes, this, as, an, anxiety, caused, by, the, false, belief, in, an, unchanging, everlasting, self, all, things, are, subject, to, change, and, taking, any, impermanent, phenomena, to, be, a, self, causes, suffering, nonetheless, his, critics, called, him, a, nihilist, who, teaches, the, annihilation, and, extermination, of, an, existing, being, the, buddha, s, response, was, that, he, only, teaches, the, cessation, of, suffering, when, an, individual, has, given, up, craving, and, the, conceit, of, i, am, their, mind, is, liberated, they, no, longer, come, into, any, state, of, being, and, are, no, longer, born, again, the, aggi, vacchagotta, sutta, records, a, conversation, between, the, buddha, and, an, individual, named, vaccha, that, further, elaborates, on, this, in, the, sutta, vaccha, asks, the, buddha, to, confirm, one, of, the, following, with, respect, to, the, existence, of, the, buddha, after, death, to, all, four, questions, the, buddha, answers, that, the, terms, reappears, somewhere, else, does, not, reappear, both, does, and, does, not, reappear, and, neither, does, nor, does, not, reappear, do, not, apply, when, vaccha, expresses, puzzlement, the, buddha, asks, vaccha, a, counter, question, to, the, effect, of, if, a, fire, were, to, go, out, and, someone, were, to, ask, you, whether, the, fire, went, north, south, east, or, west, how, would, you, reply, vaccha, replies, that, the, question, does, not, apply, and, that, an, extinguished, fire, can, only, be, classified, as, out, h, nissaro, bhikkhu, elaborates, on, the, classification, problem, around, the, words, reappear, etc, with, respect, to, the, buddha, and, nirvana, by, stating, that, a, person, who, has, attained, the, goal, is, thus, indescribable, because, abandoned, all, things, by, which, could, be, described, the, suttas, themselves, describe, the, liberated, mind, as, untraceable, or, as, consciousness, without, feature, making, no, distinction, between, the, mind, of, a, liberated, being, that, is, alive, and, the, mind, of, one, that, is, no, longer, alive, despite, the, buddha, s, explanations, to, the, contrary, buddhist, practitioners, may, at, times, still, approach, buddhism, in, a, nihilistic, manner, ajahn, amaro, illustrates, this, by, retelling, the, story, of, a, buddhist, monk, ajahn, sumedho, who, in, his, early, years, took, a, nihilistic, approach, to, nirvana, a, distinct, feature, of, nirvana, in, buddhism, is, that, an, individual, attaining, it, is, no, longer, subject, to, rebirth, ajahn, sumedho, during, a, conversation, with, his, teacher, ajahn, chah, comments, that, he, is, determined, above, all, things, to, fully, realize, nirvana, in, this, lifetime, deeply, weary, of, the, human, condition, and, determined, not, to, be, born, again, to, this, ajahn, chah, replies, what, about, the, rest, of, us, sumedho, don, t, you, care, about, those, who, ll, be, left, behind, ajahn, amaro, comments, that, ajahn, chah, could, detect, that, his, student, had, a, nihilistic, aversion, to, life, rather, than, true, detachment, the, term, nihilism, was, first, introduced, to, philosophy, by, friedrich, heinrich, jacobi, 1743, 1819, who, used, the, term, to, characterize, rationalism, and, in, particular, spinoza, s, determinism, and, the, aufkl, rung, in, order, to, carry, out, a, reductio, ad, absurdum, according, to, which, all, rationalism, philosophy, as, criticism, reduces, to, nihilism, and, thus, it, should, be, avoided, and, replaced, with, a, return, to, some, type, of, faith, and, revelation, bret, w, davis, writes, for, example, the, first, philosophical, development, of, the, idea, of, nihilism, is, generally, ascribed, to, friedrich, jacobi, who, in, a, famous, letter, criticized, fichte, s, idealism, as, falling, into, nihilism, according, to, jacobi, fichte, s, absolutization, of, the, ego, the, absolute, i, that, posits, the, not, i, is, an, inflation, of, subjectivity, that, denies, the, absolute, transcendence, of, god, a, related, but, oppositional, concept, is, fideism, which, sees, reason, as, hostile, and, inferior, to, faith, s, ren, kierkegaard, 1813, 1855, posited, an, early, form, of, nihilism, which, he, referred, to, as, leveling, he, saw, leveling, as, the, process, of, suppressing, individuality, to, a, point, where, an, individual, s, uniqueness, becomes, non, existent, and, nothing, meaningful, in, one, s, existence, can, be, affirmed, levelling, at, its, maximum, is, like, the, stillness, of, death, where, one, can, hear, one, s, own, heartbeat, a, stillness, like, death, into, which, nothing, can, penetrate, in, which, everything, sinks, powerless, one, person, can, head, a, rebellion, but, one, person, cannot, head, this, levelling, process, for, that, would, make, him, a, leader, and, he, would, avoid, being, levelled, each, individual, can, in, his, little, circle, participate, in, this, levelling, but, it, is, an, abstract, process, and, levelling, is, abstraction, conquering, individuality, kierkegaard, an, advocate, of, a, philosophy, of, life, generally, argued, against, levelling, and, its, nihilistic, consequences, although, he, believed, it, would, be, genuinely, educative, to, live, in, the, age, of, levelling, people, will, be, forced, to, face, the, judgement, of, alone, george, cotkin, asserts, kierkegaard, was, against, the, standardization, and, levelling, of, belief, both, spiritual, and, political, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, that, kierkegaard, opposed, tendencies, in, mass, culture, to, reduce, the, individual, to, a, cipher, of, conformity, and, deference, to, the, dominant, opinion, in, his, day, tabloids, like, the, danish, magazine, corsaren, and, apostate, christianity, were, instruments, of, levelling, and, contributed, to, the, reflective, apathetic, age, of, 19th, century, europe, kierkegaard, argues, that, individuals, who, can, overcome, the, levelling, process, are, stronger, for, it, and, that, it, represents, a, step, in, the, right, direction, towards, becoming, a, true, self, as, we, must, overcome, levelling, hubert, dreyfus, and, jane, rubin, argue, that, kierkegaard, s, interest, in, an, increasingly, nihilistic, age, is, in, how, we, can, recover, the, sense, that, our, lives, are, meaningful, from, the, period, 1860, 1917, russian, nihilism, was, both, a, nascent, form, of, nihilist, philosophy, and, broad, cultural, movement, which, overlapped, with, certain, revolutionary, tendencies, of, the, era, for, which, it, was, often, wrongly, characterized, as, a, form, of, political, terrorism, russian, nihilism, centered, on, the, dissolution, of, existing, values, and, ideals, incorporating, theories, of, hard, determinism, atheism, materialism, positivism, and, rational, egoism, while, rejecting, metaphysics, sentimentalism, and, aestheticism, leading, philosophers, of, this, school, of, thought, included, nikolay, chernyshevsky, and, dmitry, pisarev, the, intellectual, origins, of, the, russian, nihilist, movement, can, be, traced, back, to, 1855, and, perhaps, earlier, where, it, was, principally, a, philosophy, of, extreme, moral, and, epistemological, skepticism, however, it, was, not, until, 1862, that, the, name, nihilism, was, first, popularized, when, ivan, turgenev, used, the, term, in, his, celebrated, novel, fathers, and, sons, to, describe, the, disillusionment, of, the, younger, generation, towards, both, the, progressives, and, traditionalists, that, came, before, them, as, well, as, its, manifestation, in, the, view, that, negation, and, value, destruction, were, most, necessary, to, the, present, conditions, the, movement, very, soon, adopted, the, name, despite, the, novel, s, initial, harsh, reception, among, both, the, conservatives, and, younger, generation, though, philosophically, both, nihilistic, and, skeptical, russian, nihilism, did, not, unilaterally, negate, ethics, and, knowledge, as, may, be, assumed, nor, did, it, espouse, meaninglessness, unequivocally, even, so, contemporary, scholarship, has, challenged, the, equating, of, russian, nihilism, with, mere, skepticism, instead, identifying, it, as, a, fundamentally, promethean, movement, as, passionate, advocates, of, negation, the, nihilists, sought, to, liberate, the, promethean, might, of, the, russian, people, which, they, saw, embodied, in, a, class, of, prototypal, individuals, or, new, types, in, their, own, words, these, individuals, according, to, pisarev, in, freeing, themselves, from, all, authority, become, exempt, from, moral, authority, as, well, and, are, distinguished, above, the, rabble, or, common, masses, later, interpretations, of, nihilism, were, heavily, influenced, by, works, of, anti, nihilistic, literature, such, as, those, of, fyodor, dostoevsky, which, arose, in, response, to, russian, nihilism, in, contrast, to, the, corrupted, nihilists, who, tried, to, numb, their, nihilistic, sensitivity, and, forget, themselves, through, self, indulgence, dostoevsky, s, figures, voluntarily, leap, into, nihilism, and, try, to, be, themselves, within, its, boundaries, writes, contemporary, scholar, nishitani, the, nihility, expressed, in, if, there, is, no, god, everything, is, permitted, or, apr, s, moi, le, d, luge, provides, a, principle, whose, sincerity, they, try, to, live, out, to, the, end, they, search, for, and, experiment, with, ways, for, the, self, to, justify, itself, after, god, has, disappeared, nihilism, is, often, associated, with, the, german, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, who, provided, a, detailed, diagnosis, of, nihilism, as, a, widespread, phenomenon, of, western, culture, though, the, notion, appears, frequently, throughout, nietzsche, s, work, he, uses, the, term, in, a, variety, of, ways, with, different, meanings, and, connotations, with, regard, to, nietzsche, s, development, of, thought, it, has, been, noted, in, research, that, although, he, dealt, with, nihilistic, themes, from, 1869, onwards, pessimism, with, nirvana, and, with, nothingness, and, non, being, a, conceptual, use, of, nihilism, occurred, for, the, first, time, in, handwritten, notes, in, the, middle, of, 1880, ksa, 9, 127, 128, this, was, the, time, of, a, then, popular, scientific, work, that, reconstructed, the, so, called, russian, nihilism, on, the, basis, of, russian, newspaper, reports, on, nihilistic, incidents, n, karlowitsch, die, entwicklung, des, nihilismus, berlin, 1880, this, collection, of, material, published, in, three, editions, was, not, only, known, to, a, broad, german, readership, but, its, influence, on, nietzsche, can, also, be, proven, karen, l, carr, describes, nietzsche, s, characterization, of, nihilism, as, a, condition, of, tension, as, a, disproportion, between, what, we, want, to, value, or, need, and, how, the, world, appears, to, operate, 25, when, we, find, out, that, the, world, does, not, possess, the, objective, value, or, meaning, that, we, want, it, to, have, or, have, long, since, believed, it, to, have, we, find, ourselves, in, a, crisis, nietzsche, asserts, that, with, the, decline, of, christianity, and, the, rise, of, physiological, decadence, nihilism, is, in, fact, characteristic, of, the, modern, age, though, he, implies, that, the, rise, of, nihilism, is, still, incomplete, and, that, it, has, yet, to, be, overcome, though, the, problem, of, nihilism, becomes, especially, explicit, in, nietzsche, s, notebooks, published, posthumously, it, is, mentioned, repeatedly, in, his, published, works, and, is, closely, connected, to, many, of, the, problems, mentioned, there, nietzsche, characterized, nihilism, as, emptying, the, world, and, especially, human, existence, of, meaning, purpose, comprehensible, truth, or, essential, value, this, observation, stems, in, part, from, nietzsche, s, perspectivism, or, his, notion, that, knowledge, is, always, by, someone, of, some, thing, it, is, always, bound, by, perspective, and, it, is, never, mere, fact, rather, there, are, interpretations, through, which, we, understand, the, world, and, give, it, meaning, interpreting, is, something, we, can, not, go, without, in, fact, it, is, a, condition, of, subjectivity, one, way, of, interpreting, the, world, is, through, morality, as, one, of, the, fundamental, ways, that, people, make, sense, of, the, world, especially, in, regard, to, their, own, thoughts, and, actions, nietzsche, distinguishes, a, morality, that, is, strong, or, healthy, meaning, that, the, person, in, question, is, aware, that, he, constructs, it, himself, from, weak, morality, where, the, interpretation, is, projected, on, to, something, external, nietzsche, discusses, christianity, one, of, the, major, topics, in, his, work, at, length, in, the, context, of, the, problem, of, nihilism, in, his, notebooks, in, a, chapter, entitled, european, nihilism, here, he, states, that, the, christian, moral, doctrine, provides, people, with, intrinsic, value, belief, in, god, which, justifies, the, evil, in, the, world, and, a, basis, for, objective, knowledge, in, this, sense, in, constructing, a, world, where, objective, knowledge, is, possible, christianity, is, an, antidote, against, a, primal, form, of, nihilism, against, the, despair, of, meaninglessness, however, it, is, exactly, the, element, of, truthfulness, in, christian, doctrine, that, is, its, undoing, in, its, drive, towards, truth, christianity, eventually, finds, itself, to, be, a, construct, which, leads, to, its, own, dissolution, it, is, therefore, that, nietzsche, states, that, we, have, outgrown, christianity, not, because, we, lived, too, far, from, it, rather, because, we, lived, too, close, as, such, the, self, dissolution, of, christianity, constitutes, yet, another, form, of, nihilism, because, christianity, was, an, interpretation, that, posited, itself, as, the, interpretation, nietzsche, states, that, this, dissolution, leads, beyond, skepticism, to, a, distrust, of, all, meaning, 41, 2, stanley, rosen, identifies, nietzsche, s, concept, of, nihilism, with, a, situation, of, meaninglessness, in, which, everything, is, permitted, according, to, him, the, loss, of, higher, metaphysical, values, that, exist, in, contrast, to, the, base, reality, of, the, world, or, merely, human, ideas, gives, rise, to, the, idea, that, all, human, ideas, are, therefore, valueless, rejecting, idealism, thus, results, in, nihilism, because, only, similarly, transcendent, ideals, live, up, to, the, previous, standards, that, the, nihilist, still, implicitly, holds, the, inability, for, christianity, to, serve, as, a, source, of, valuating, the, world, is, reflected, in, nietzsche, s, famous, aphorism, of, the, madman, in, the, gay, science, the, death, of, god, in, particular, the, statement, that, we, killed, him, is, similar, to, the, self, dissolution, of, christian, doctrine, due, to, the, advances, of, the, sciences, which, for, nietzsche, show, that, man, is, the, product, of, evolution, that, earth, has, no, special, place, among, the, stars, and, that, history, is, not, progressive, the, christian, notion, of, god, can, no, longer, serve, as, a, basis, for, a, morality, one, such, reaction, to, the, loss, of, meaning, is, what, nietzsche, calls, passive, nihilism, which, he, recognizes, in, the, pessimistic, philosophy, of, schopenhauer, schopenhauer, s, doctrine, which, nietzsche, also, refers, to, as, western, buddhism, advocates, separating, oneself, from, will, and, desires, in, order, to, reduce, suffering, nietzsche, characterizes, this, attitude, as, a, will, to, nothingness, whereby, life, turns, away, from, itself, as, there, is, nothing, of, value, to, be, found, in, the, world, this, mowing, away, of, all, value, in, the, world, is, characteristic, of, the, nihilist, although, in, this, the, nihilist, appears, inconsistent, this, will, to, nothingness, is, still, a, form, of, valuation, or, willing, he, describes, this, as, an, inconsistency, on, the, part, of, the, nihilists, a, nihilist, is, a, man, who, judges, of, the, world, as, it, is, that, it, ought, not, to, be, and, of, the, world, as, it, ought, to, be, that, it, does, not, exist, according, to, this, view, our, existence, action, suffering, willing, feeling, has, no, meaning, the, pathos, of, in, vain, is, the, nihilists, pathos, at, the, same, time, as, pathos, an, inconsistency, on, the, part, of, the, nihilists, nietzsche, s, relation, to, the, problem, of, nihilism, is, a, complex, one, he, approaches, the, problem, of, nihilism, as, deeply, personal, stating, that, this, predicament, of, the, modern, world, is, a, problem, that, has, become, conscious, in, him, according, to, nietzsche, it, is, only, when, nihilism, is, overcome, that, a, culture, can, have, a, true, foundation, upon, which, to, thrive, he, wished, to, hasten, its, coming, only, so, that, he, could, also, hasten, its, ultimate, departure, he, states, that, there, is, at, least, the, possibility, of, another, type, of, nihilist, in, the, wake, of, christianity, s, self, dissolution, one, that, does, not, stop, after, the, destruction, of, all, value, and, meaning, and, succumb, to, the, following, nothingness, this, alternate, active, nihilism, on, the, other, hand, destroys, to, level, the, field, for, constructing, something, new, this, form, of, nihilism, is, characterized, by, nietzsche, as, a, sign, of, strength, a, willful, destruction, of, the, old, values, to, wipe, the, slate, clean, and, lay, down, one, s, own, beliefs, and, interpretations, contrary, to, the, passive, nihilism, that, resigns, itself, with, the, decomposition, of, the, old, values, this, willful, destruction, of, values, and, the, overcoming, of, the, condition, of, nihilism, by, the, constructing, of, new, meaning, this, active, nihilism, could, be, related, to, what, nietzsche, elsewhere, calls, a, free, spirit, 43, 50, or, the, bermensch, from, thus, spoke, zarathustra, and, the, antichrist, the, model, of, the, strong, individual, who, posits, his, own, values, and, lives, his, life, as, if, it, were, his, own, work, of, art, it, may, be, questioned, though, whether, active, nihilism, is, indeed, the, correct, term, for, this, stance, and, some, question, whether, nietzsche, takes, the, problems, nihilism, poses, seriously, enough, martin, heidegger, s, interpretation, of, nietzsche, influenced, many, postmodern, thinkers, who, investigated, the, problem, of, nihilism, as, put, forward, by, nietzsche, only, recently, has, heidegger, s, influence, on, nietzschean, nihilism, research, faded, as, early, as, the, 1930s, heidegger, was, giving, lectures, on, nietzsche, s, thought, given, the, importance, of, nietzsche, s, contribution, to, the, topic, of, nihilism, heidegger, s, influential, interpretation, of, nietzsche, is, important, for, the, historical, development, of, the, term, nihilism, heidegger, s, method, of, researching, and, teaching, nietzsche, is, explicitly, his, own, he, does, not, specifically, try, to, present, nietzsche, as, nietzsche, he, rather, tries, to, incorporate, nietzsche, s, thoughts, into, his, own, philosophical, system, of, being, time, and, dasein, in, his, nihilism, as, determined, by, the, history, of, being, 1944, 46, heidegger, tries, to, understand, nietzsche, s, nihilism, as, trying, to, achieve, a, victory, through, the, devaluation, of, the, until, then, highest, values, the, principle, of, this, devaluation, is, according, to, heidegger, the, will, to, power, the, will, to, power, is, also, the, principle, of, every, earlier, valuation, of, values, how, does, this, devaluation, occur, and, why, is, this, nihilistic, one, of, heidegger, s, main, critiques, on, philosophy, is, that, philosophy, and, more, specifically, metaphysics, has, forgotten, to, discriminate, between, investigating, the, notion, of, a, being, seiende, and, being, sein, according, to, heidegger, the, history, of, western, thought, can, be, seen, as, the, history, of, metaphysics, moreover, because, metaphysics, has, forgotten, to, ask, about, the, notion, of, being, what, heidegger, calls, seinsvergessenheit, it, is, a, history, about, the, destruction, of, being, that, is, why, heidegger, calls, metaphysics, nihilistic, this, makes, nietzsche, s, metaphysics, not, a, victory, over, nihilism, but, a, perfection, of, it, heidegger, in, his, interpretation, of, nietzsche, has, been, inspired, by, ernst, j, nger, many, references, to, j, nger, can, be, found, in, heidegger, s, lectures, on, nietzsche, for, example, in, a, letter, to, the, rector, of, freiburg, university, of, november, 4, 1945, heidegger, inspired, by, j, nger, tries, to, explain, the, notion, of, god, is, dead, as, the, reality, of, the, will, to, power, heidegger, also, praises, j, nger, for, defending, nietzsche, against, a, too, biological, or, anthropological, reading, during, the, nazi, era, heidegger, s, interpretation, of, nietzsche, influenced, a, number, of, important, postmodernist, thinkers, gianni, vattimo, points, at, a, back, and, forth, movement, in, european, thought, between, nietzsche, and, heidegger, during, the, 1960s, a, nietzschean, renaissance, began, culminating, in, the, work, of, mazzino, montinari, and, giorgio, colli, they, began, work, on, a, new, and, complete, edition, of, nietzsche, s, collected, works, making, nietzsche, more, accessible, for, scholarly, research, vattimo, explains, that, with, this, new, edition, of, colli, and, montinari, a, critical, reception, of, heidegger, s, interpretation, of, nietzsche, began, to, take, shape, like, other, contemporary, french, and, italian, philosophers, vattimo, does, not, want, or, only, partially, wants, to, rely, on, heidegger, for, understanding, nietzsche, on, the, other, hand, vattimo, judges, heidegger, s, intentions, authentic, enough, to, keep, pursuing, them, philosophers, who, vattimo, exemplifies, as, a, part, of, this, back, and, forth, movement, are, french, philosophers, deleuze, foucault, and, derrida, italian, philosophers, of, this, same, movement, are, cacciari, severino, and, himself, j, rgen, habermas, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, and, richard, rorty, are, also, philosophers, who, are, influenced, by, heidegger, s, interpretation, of, nietzsche, gilles, deleuze, s, interpretation, of, nietzsche, s, concept, of, nihilism, is, different, in, some, sense, diametrically, opposed, to, the, usual, definition, as, outlined, in, the, rest, of, this, article, nihilism, is, one, of, the, main, topics, of, deleuze, s, early, book, nietzsche, and, philosophy, 1962, there, deleuze, repeatedly, interprets, nietzsche, s, nihilism, as, the, enterprise, of, denying, life, and, depreciating, existence, nihilism, thus, defined, is, therefore, not, the, denial, of, higher, values, or, the, denial, of, meaning, but, rather, the, depreciation, of, life, in, the, name, of, such, higher, values, or, meaning, deleuze, therefore, with, he, claims, nietzsche, says, that, christianity, and, platonism, and, with, them, the, whole, of, metaphysics, are, intrinsically, nihilist, postmodern, and, poststructuralist, thought, has, questioned, the, very, grounds, on, which, western, cultures, have, based, their, truths, absolute, knowledge, and, meaning, a, decentralization, of, authorship, the, accumulation, of, positive, knowledge, historical, progress, and, certain, ideals, and, practices, of, humanism, and, the, enlightenment, jacques, derrida, whose, deconstruction, is, perhaps, most, commonly, labeled, nihilistic, did, not, himself, make, the, nihilistic, move, that, others, have, claimed, derridean, deconstructionists, argue, that, this, approach, rather, frees, texts, individuals, or, organizations, from, a, restrictive, truth, and, that, deconstruction, opens, up, the, possibility, of, other, ways, of, being, gayatri, chakravorty, spivak, for, example, uses, deconstruction, to, create, an, ethics, of, opening, up, western, scholarship, to, the, voice, of, the, subaltern, and, to, philosophies, outside, of, the, canon, of, western, texts, derrida, himself, built, a, philosophy, based, upon, a, responsibility, to, the, other, deconstruction, can, thus, be, seen, not, as, a, denial, of, truth, but, as, a, denial, of, our, ability, to, know, truth, that, is, to, say, it, makes, an, epistemological, claim, compared, to, nihilism, s, ontological, claim, lyotard, argues, that, rather, than, relying, on, an, objective, truth, or, method, to, prove, their, claims, philosophers, legitimize, their, truths, by, reference, to, a, story, about, the, world, that, can, not, be, separated, from, the, age, and, system, the, stories, belong, to, referred, to, by, lyotard, as, meta, narratives, he, then, goes, on, to, define, the, postmodern, condition, as, characterized, by, a, rejection, both, of, these, meta, narratives, and, of, the, process, of, legitimation, by, meta, narratives, this, concept, of, the, instability, of, truth, and, meaning, leads, in, the, direction, of, nihilism, though, lyotard, stops, short, of, embracing, the, latter, in, lieu, of, meta, narratives, we, have, created, new, language, games, in, order, to, legitimize, our, claims, which, rely, on, changing, relationships, and, mutable, truths, none, of, which, is, privileged, over, the, other, to, speak, to, ultimate, truth, postmodern, theorist, jean, baudrillard, wrote, briefly, of, nihilism, from, the, postmodern, viewpoint, in, simulacra, and, simulation, he, stuck, mainly, to, topics, of, interpretations, of, the, real, world, over, the, simulations, of, which, the, real, world, is, composed, the, uses, of, meaning, were, an, important, subject, in, baudrillard, s, discussion, of, nihilism, the, apocalypse, is, finished, today, it, is, the, precession, of, the, neutral, of, forms, of, the, neutral, and, of, indifference, all, that, remains, is, the, fascination, for, desertlike, and, indifferent, forms, for, the, very, operation, of, the, system, that, annihilates, us, now, fascination, in, contrast, to, seduction, which, was, attached, to, appearances, and, to, dialectical, reason, which, was, attached, to, meaning, is, a, nihilistic, passion, par, excellence, it, is, the, passion, proper, to, the, mode, of, disappearance, we, are, fascinated, by, all, forms, of, disappearance, of, our, disappearance, melancholic, and, fascinated, such, is, our, general, situation, in, an, era, of, involuntary, transparency, from, the, 19th, century, nihilism, has, encompassed, a, range, of, positions, within, various, fields, of, philosophy, each, of, these, as, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, states, denied, the, existence, of, genuine, moral, truths, or, values, rejected, the, possibility, of, knowledge, or, communication, and, asserted, the, ultimate, meaninglessness, or, purposelessness, of, life, or, of, the, universe, the, term, dada, was, first, used, by, richard, huelsenbeck, and, tristan, tzara, in, 1916, the, movement, which, lasted, from, approximately, 1916, to, 1923, arose, during, world, war, i, an, event, that, influenced, the, artists, the, dada, movement, began, in, the, old, town, of, z, rich, switzerland, known, as, the, niederdorf, or, niederd, rfli, in, the, caf, voltaire, the, dadaists, claimed, that, dada, was, not, an, art, movement, but, an, anti, art, movement, sometimes, using, found, objects, in, a, manner, similar, to, found, poetry, this, tendency, toward, devaluation, of, art, has, led, many, to, claim, that, dada, was, an, essentially, nihilistic, movement, given, that, dada, created, its, own, means, for, interpreting, its, products, it, is, difficult, to, classify, alongside, most, other, contemporary, art, expressions, due, to, perceived, ambiguity, it, has, been, classified, as, a, nihilistic, modus, vivendi, the, term, nihilism, was, actually, popularized, in, 1862, by, ivan, turgenev, in, his, novel, fathers, and, sons, whose, hero, bazarov, was, a, nihilist, and, recruited, several, followers, to, the, philosophy, he, found, his, nihilistic, ways, challenged, upon, falling, in, love, anton, chekhov, portrayed, nihilism, when, writing, three, sisters, the, phrase, what, does, it, matter, or, variants, of, this, are, often, spoken, by, several, characters, in, response, to, events, the, significance, of, some, of, these, events, suggests, a, subscription, to, nihilism, by, said, characters, as, a, type, of, coping, strategy, the, philosophical, ideas, of, the, french, author, the, marquis, de, sade, are, often, noted, as, early, examples, of, nihilistic, principles, the, frequently, self, destructive, and, amoral, tendencies, of, a, nihilistic, worldview, can, be, seen, in, many, of, today, s, media, including, movies, and, tv, shows, patrick, bateman, in, bret, easton, ellis, s, 1991, novel, american, psycho, and, 2000, film, adaptation, displays, both, moral, and, existential, nihilism, throughout, the, film, bateman, does, not, shy, away, from, murder, or, torture, to, accomplish, his, goals, as, he, realizes, the, evil, in, his, deeds, he, tries, to, confess, and, take, on, the, punishment, for, his, acts, of, crime, phil, connors, in, the, 1993, comedy, film, groundhog, day, develops, existential, nihilistic, tendencies, near, the, middle, of, the, film, as, he, lives, the, same, day, an, unspoken, countless, number, of, times, he, slips, into, a, depression, and, attempts, to, take, his, own, life, in, a, variety, of, different, ways, he, will, also, resort, to, kidnapping, punxsutawney, phil, the, groundhog, to, which, he, credits, his, looping, days, and, drives, off, a, cliff, killing, both, of, them,

only, about, themselves, in, the, 2022, film, everything, everywhere, all, at, once, the, lead, antagonist, jobu, tupaki, comes, to, an, existential, nihilistic, conclusion, that, the, infinite, chaos, of, the, multiverse, means, that, there, is, no, reason, to, continue, to, exist, she, manifests, her, nihilism, by, creating, a, black, hole, like, everything, bagel, in, which, she, will, destroy, herself, and, the, rest, of, the, multiverse, her, mother, evelyn, is, briefly, persuaded, by, her, logic, but, then, refutes, it, in, favor, of, a, more, positive, outlook, based, on, the,
