cycle, in, a, literal, sense, that, helps, individuals, better, understand, their, minds, for, example, meditation, leads, to, understanding, leading, to, kindness, leading, to, peace, etc, in, christianity, a, church, service, is, a, formalized, period, of, communal, worship, often, but, not, exclusively, occurring, on, sunday, or, on, saturday, in, the, case, of, those, churches, practicing, seventh, day, sabbatarianism, the, church, service, is, the, gathering, together, of, christians, to, be, taught, the, word, of, god, the, holy, bible, and, encouraged, in, their, faith, technically, the, church, in, church, service, refers, to, the, gathering, of, the, faithful, rather, than, to, the, building, in, which, the, event, takes, place, in, christianity, worship, is,

different, concepts, the, external, acts, of, veneration, resemble, those, of, worship, but, differ, in, their, object, and, intent, protestant, christians, who, reject, the, veneration, of, saints, question, whether, catholics, always, maintain, such, a, distinction, in, actual, devotional, practice, especially, at, the, level, of, folk, religion, according, to, mark, miravalle, the, english, word, worship, is, equivocal, in, that, it, has, been, used, in, catholic, writing, at, any, rate, to, denote, both, adoration, latria, and, veneration, dulia, and, in, some, cases, even, as, a, synonym, for, veneration, as, distinct, from, adoration, as, st, thomas, aquinas, explains, adoration, which, is, known, as, latria, in, classical, theology, is, the, worship, and, homage, that, is, rightly, offered, to, god, alone, it, is, the, manifestation, of, submission, and, acknowledgement, of, dependence, appropriately, shown, towards, the, excellence, of, an, uncreated, divine, person, and, to, his, absolute, lordship, it, is, the, worship, of, the, creator, that, god, alone, deserves, although, we, see, in, english, a, broader, usage, of, the, word, adoration, which, may, not, refer, to, a, form, of, worship, exclusive, to, god, for, example, when, a, husband, says, that, he, adores, his, wife, in, general, it, can, be, maintained, that, adoration, is, the, best, english, denotation, for, the, worship, of, latria, veneration, known, as, dulia, in, classical, theology, the, honor, and, reverence, appropriately, due, to, the, excellence, of, a, created, person, excellence, exhibited, by, created, beings, likewise, deserves, recognition, and, honor, we, see, a, general, example, of, veneration, in, events, like, the, awarding, of, academic, awards, for, excellence, in, school, or, the, awarding, of, olympic, medals, for, excellence, in, sports, there, is, nothing, contrary, to, the, proper, adoration, of, god, when, we, offer, the, appropriate, honor, and, recognition, that, created, persons, deserve, based, achievement, in, excellence, we, must, make, a, further, clarification, regarding, the, use, of, the, term, worship, in, relation, to, the, categories, of, adoration, and, veneration, historically, schools, of, theology, have, used, the, term, worship, as, a, general, term, which, included, both, adoration, and, veneration, they, would, distinguish, between, worship, of, adoration, and, worship, of, veneration, the, word, worship, in, a, similar, way, to, how, the, liturgical, term, cult, is, traditionally, used, was, not, synonymous, with, adoration, but, could, be, used, to, introduce, either, adoration, or, veneration, hence, catholic, sources, will, sometimes, use, the, term, worship, not, to, indicate, adoration, but, only, the, worship, of, veneration, given, to, mary, and, the, saints, orthodox, judaism, and, orthodox, sunni, islam, hold, that, for, all, practical, purposes, veneration, should, be, considered, the, same, as, prayer, orthodox, judaism, arguably, with, the, exception, of, some, chasidic, practices, orthodox, sunni, islam, and, most, kinds, of, protestantism, forbid, veneration, of, saints, or, of, angels, classifying, these, actions, as, akin, to, idolatry, similarly, jehovah, s, witnesses, assert, that, many, actions, classified, as, patriotic, by, protestant, groups, such, as, saluting, a, flag, count, as, equivalent, to, worship, and, are, therefore, considered, idolatrous, as, well, quakers, the, religious, society, of, friends, have, both, unprogrammed, and, programmed, meetings, for, worship, unprogrammed, worship, is, based, on, silence, and, inward, listening, to, the, spirit, from, which, any, participant, may, share, a, message, in, unprogrammed, meetings, for, worship, someone, speaks, when, that, person, feels, that, god, spirit, the, universe, has, given, them, a, message, for, others, programmed, worship, includes, many, elements, similar, to, protestant, services, such, as, a, sermon, and, hymns, many, programmed, meetings, also, include, a, time, during, the, service, for, silent, expectant, waiting, and, messages, from, the, participants, worship, in, hinduism, involves, invoking, higher, forces, to, assist, in, spiritual, and, material, progress, and, is, simultaneously, both, a, science, and, an, art, a, sense, of, bhakti, or, devotional, love, is, generally, invoked, this, term, is, probably, a, central, one, in, hinduism, a, direct, translation, from, the, sanskrit, to, english, is, problematic, worship, takes, a, multitude, of, forms, depending, on, community, groups, geography, and, language, there, is, a, flavour, of, loving, and, being, in, love, with, whatever, object, or, focus, of, devotion, worship, is, not, confined, to, any, place, of, worship, it, also, incorporates, personal, reflection, art, forms, and, group, people, usually, perform, worship, to, achieve, some, specific, end, or, to, integrate, the, body, the, mind, and, the, spirit, in, order, to, help, the, performer, evolve, into, a, higher, being, in, islam, worship, refers, to, ritualistic, devotion, as, well, as, actions, done, in, accordance, to, islamic, law, which, is, ordained, by, and, pleasing, to, god, worship, included, in, the, five, pillars, of, islam, primarily, that, of, salat, which, is, the, practice, of, ritual, prayer, five, times, daily, according, to, muhammad, asad, on, his, notes, in, the, message, of, the, qur, an, translation, on, q51, 56, thus, the, innermost, purpose, of, the, creation, of, all, rational, beings, is, their, cognition, of, the, existence, of, allah, and, hence, their, conscious, willingness, to, conform, their, own, existence, to, whatever, they, may, perceive, of, his, will, and, plan, and, it, is, this, twofold, concept, of, cognition, and, willingness, that, gives, the, deepest, meaning, to, what, the, quran, describes, as, worship, as, the, next, verse, shows, this, spiritual, call, does, not, arise, from, any, supposed, need, on, the, part, of, the, creator, who, is, self, sufficient, and, infinite, in, his, power, but, is, designed, as, an, instrument, for, the, inner, development, of, the, worshipper, who, by, the, act, of, his, conscious, self, surrender, to, the, all, pervading, creative, will, may, hope, to, come, closer, to, an, understanding, of, that, will, and, thus, closer, to, allah, himself, in, the, muslim, world, the, word, worship, in, the, literal, context, of, worshipping, is, forbidden, to, be, used, if, it, refers, to, an, object, or, action, and, not, exclusively, to, allah, worship, of, god, in, judaism, is, called, avodat, hashem, during, the, period, when, the, temple, stood, the, rites, conducted, there, were, considered, the, most, important, act, of, jewish, worship, however, the, most, common, form, of, worship, was, and, remains, that, of, prayer, other, forms, of, worship, include, the, conduct, of, prescribed, rituals, such, as, the, passover, seder, and, waving, the, four, species, with, proper, intent, as, well, as, various, types, of, jewish, meditation, jewish, sources, also, express, the, notion, that, one, can, perform, any, appropriate, mundane, activity, as, the, worship, of, god, examples, would, include, returning, a, lost, article, and, working, to, support, oneself, and, one, s, family, the, code, of, jewish, law, orach, chayim, chapter, 231, cites, proverbs, 3, 6, in, all, your, ways, know, him, hebrew, b, chol, d, rachecha, dei, eihu, as, a, biblical, source, for, this, idea, in, sikhism, worship, takes, place, after, the, guru, granth, sahib, which, is, the, work, of, the, 10, sikh, gurus, all, in, one, sikhs, worship, god, and, only, one, god,

in, modern, society, and, sociology, some, writers, have, commented, on, the, ways, that, people, no, longer, simply, worship, recognised, deities, but, also, or, instead, worship, consumer, brands, sports, teams, and, other, people, celebrities, sociology, therefore, extends, this, argument, to, suggest, outside, of, a, religion, worship, is, a, process, whereby, society, worships, itself, as, a, form, of, self, valorization, and, self, preservation
