asia, europe, east, asia, europe, indo, aryan, iranian, indo, aryan, iranian, others, european, germanic, paganism, or, germanic, religion, refers, to, the, traditional, culturally, significant, religion, of, the, germanic, peoples, with, a, chronological, range, of, at, least, one, thousand, years, in, an, area, covering, scandinavia, the, british, isles, modern, germany, the, netherlands, and, at, times, other, parts, of, europe, the, beliefs, and, practices, of, germanic, paganism, varied, scholars, typically, assume, some, degree, of, continuity, between, roman, era, beliefs, and, those, found, in, norse, paganism, as, well, as, between, germanic, religion, and, reconstructed, indo, european, religion, and, post, conversion, folklore, though, the, precise, degree, and, details, of, this, continuity, are, subjects, of, debate, germanic, religion, was, influenced, by, neighboring, cultures, including, that, of, the, celts, the, romans, and, later, by, the, christian, religion, very, few, sources, exist, that, were, written, by, pagan, adherents, themselves, instead, most, were, written, by, outsiders, and, can, thus, present, problems, for, reconstructing, authentic, germanic, beliefs, and, practices, some, basic, aspects, of, germanic, belief, can, be, reconstructed, including, the, existence, of, one, or, more, origin, myths, the, existence, of, a, myth, of, the, end, of, the, world, a, general, belief, in, the, inhabited, world, being, a, middle, earth, as, well, as, some, aspects, of, belief, in, fate, and, the, afterlife, the, germanic, peoples, believed, in, a, multitude, of, gods, and, in, other, supernatural, beings, such, as, j, tnar, often, glossed, as, giants, dwarfs, elves, and, dragons, roman, era, sources, using, roman, names, mention, several, important, male, gods, as, well, as, several, goddesses, such, as, nerthus, and, the, matronae, early, medieval, sources, identify, a, pantheon, consisting, of, the, gods, wodanaz, odin, thunraz, thor, tiwaz, tyr, and, frijj, frigg, as, well, as, numerous, other, gods, many, of, whom, are, only, attested, from, norse, sources, see, proto, germanic, folklore, textual, and, archaeological, sources, allow, the, reconstruction, of, aspects, of, germanic, ritual, and, practice, these, include, well, attested, burial, practices, which, likely, had, religious, significance, such, as, rich, grave, goods, and, the, burial, in, ships, or, wagons, wooden, carved, figures, that, may, represent, gods, have, been, discovered, in, bogs, throughout, northern, europe, and, rich, sacrificial, deposits, including, objects, animals, and, human, remains, have, been, discovered, in, springs, bogs, and, under, the, foundations, of, new, structures, evidence, for, sacred, places, includes, not, only, natural, locations, such, as, sacred, groves, but, also, early, evidence, for, the, construction, of, structures, such, as, temples, and, the, worship, of, standing, poles, in, some, places, other, known, germanic, religious, practices, include, divination, and, magic, and, there, is, some, evidence, for, festivals, and, the, existence, of, priests, germanic, religion, is, principally, defined, as, the, religious, traditions, of, speakers, of, germanic, languages, the, germanic, peoples, the, term, religion, in, this, context, is, itself, controversial, bernhard, maier, noting, that, it, implies, a, specifically, modern, point, of, view, which, reflects, the, modern, conceptual, isolation, of, religion, from, other, aspects, of, culture, never, a, unified, or, codified, set, of, beliefs, or, practices, germanic, religion, showed, strong, regional, variations, and, rudolf, simek, writes, that, it, is, better, to, refer, to, germanic, religions, in, many, contact, areas, e, g, rhineland, and, eastern, and, northern, scandinavia, germanic, paganism, was, similar, to, neighboring, religions, such, as, those, of, the, slavs, celts, or, finnic, peoples, the, use, of, the, qualifier, germanic, e, g, germanic, religion, and, its, variants, remains, common, in, german, language, scholarship, but, is, less, commonly, used, in, english, and, other, scholarly, languages, where, scholars, usually, specify, which, branch, of, paganism, is, meant, e, g, norse, paganism, or, anglo, saxon, paganism, the, term, germanic, religion, is, sometimes, applied, to, practices, dating, to, as, early, as, the, stone, age, or, bronze, age, but, its, use, is, more, generally, restricted, to, the, time, period, after, the, germanic, languages, had, become, distinct, from, other, indo, european, languages, early, iron, age, germanic, paganism, covers, a, period, of, around, one, thousand, years, in, terms, of, written, sources, from, the, first, reports, in, roman, sources, to, the, final, conversion, to, christianity, because, of, the, amount, of, time, and, space, covered, by, the, term, germanic, religion, controversy, exists, as, to, the, degree, of, continuity, of, beliefs, and, practices, between, the, earliest, attestations, in, tacitus, and, the, later, attestations, of, norse, paganism, from, the, high, middle, ages, many, scholars, argue, for, continuity, seeing, evidence, of, commonalities, between, the, roman, early, medieval, and, norse, attestations, while, many, other, scholars, are, skeptical, the, majority, of, germanic, gods, attested, by, name, during, the, roman, period, cannot, be, related, to, a, later, norse, god, many, names, attested, in, the, nordic, sources, are, similarly, without, any, known, non, nordic, equivalents, the, much, higher, number, of, sources, on, scandinavian, religion, has, led, to, a, methodologically, problematic, tendency, to, use, scandinavian, material, to, complete, and, interpret, the, much, more, sparsely, attested, information, on, continental, germanic, religion, most, scholars, accept, some, form, of, continuity, between, indo, european, and, germanic, religion, but, the, degree, of, continuity, is, a, subject, of, controversy, jens, peter, schj, dt, writes, that, while, many, scholars, view, comparisons, of, germanic, religion, with, other, attested, indo, european, religions, positively, just, as, many, or, perhaps, even, more, have, been, sceptical, while, supportive, of, indo, european, comparison, schj, dt, notes, that, the, dangers, of, comparison, are, taking, disparate, elements, out, of, context, and, arguing, that, myths, and, mythical, structures, found, around, the, world, must, be, indo, european, just, because, they, appear, in, multiple, indo, european, cultures, bernhard, maier, argues, that, similarities, with, other, indo, european, religions, do, not, necessarily, result, from, a, common, origin, but, can, also, be, the, result, of, convergence, continuity, also, concerns, the, question, of, whether, popular, post, conversion, beliefs, and, practices, folklore, found, among, germanic, speakers, up, to, the, modern, day, reflect, a, continuity, with, earlier, germanic, religion, earlier, scholars, beginning, with, jacob, grimm, believed, that, modern, folklore, was, of, ancient, origin, and, had, changed, little, over, the, centuries, which, allowed, the, use, of, folklore, and, fairy, tales, as, sources, of, germanic, religion, these, ideas, later, came, under, the, influence, of, v, lkisch, ideology, which, stressed, the, organic, unity, of, a, germanic, national, spirit, volksgeist, as, expressed, in, otto, h, fler, s, germanic, continuity, theory, as, a, result, the, use, of, folklore, as, a, source, went, out, of, fashion, after, world, war, ii, especially, in, germany, but, has, experienced, a, revival, since, the, 1990s, in, nordic, scholarship, today, scholars, are, cautious, in, their, use, of, folkloric, material, keeping, in, mind, that, most, was, collected, long, after, the, conversion, and, the, advent, of, writing, areas, where, continuity, can, be, noted, include, agrarian, rites, and, magical, ideas, as, well, as, the, root, elements, of, some, folktales, sources, on, germanic, religion, can, be, divided, between, primary, sources, and, secondary, sources, primary, sources, include, texts, structures, place, names, personal, names, and, objects, that, were, created, by, devotees, of, the, religion, secondary, sources, are, normally, texts, that, were, written, by, outsiders, examples, of, primary, sources, include, some, latin, alphabet, and, runic, inscriptions, as, well, as, poetic, texts, such, as, the, merseburg, charms, and, heroic, texts, that, may, date, from, pagan, times, but, were, written, down, by, christians, the, poems, of, the, edda, while, pagan, in, origin, continued, to, circulate, orally, in, a, christian, context, before, being, written, down, which, makes, an, application, to, pre, christian, times, difficult, in, contrast, pre, christian, images, such, as, on, bracteates, gold, foil, figures, and, rune, and, picture, stones, are, direct, attestations, of, germanic, religion, the, interpretation, of, these, images, is, not, always, immediately, obvious, archaeological, evidence, is, also, extensive, including, evidence, from, burials, and, sacrificial, sites, ancient, votive, altars, from, the, rhineland, often, contain, inscriptions, naming, gods, with, germanic, or, partially, germanic, names, most, textual, sources, on, germanic, religion, were, written, by, outsiders, the, chief, textual, source, for, germanic, religion, in, the, roman, period, is, tacitus, s, germania, there, are, problems, with, tacitus, s, work, however, as, it, is, unclear, how, much, he, really, knew, about, the, germanic, peoples, he, described, and, because, he, employed, numerous, topoi, dating, back, to, herodotus, that, were, used, when, describing, a, barbarian, people, tacitus, reliability, as, a, source, can, be, characterized, by, his, rhetorical, tendencies, since, one, of, the, purposes, of, germania, was, to, present, his, roman, compatriots, with, an, example, of, the, virtues, he, believed, they, lacked, julius, caesar, procopius, and, other, ancient, authors, also, offer, some, information, on, germanic, religion, textual, sources, for, post, roman, continental, germanic, religion, are, written, by, christian, authors, some, of, the, gods, of, the, lombards, are, described, in, the, 7th, century, origo, gentis, langobardorum, origin, of, the, lombard, people, while, a, small, amount, of, information, on, the, religion, of, the, pagan, franks, can, be, found, in, gregory, of, tours, s, late, 6th, century, historia, francorum, history, of, the, franks, an, important, source, for, the, pre, christian, religion, of, the, anglo, saxons, is, bede, s, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, c, 731, other, sources, include, historians, such, as, jordanes, 6th, century, ce, and, paul, the, deacon, 8th, century, as, well, as, saint, lives, and, christian, legislation, against, various, practices, textual, sources, for, scandinavian, religion, are, much, more, extensive, they, include, the, aforementioned, poems, of, the, poetic, edda, eddic, poetry, found, in, other, sources, the, prose, edda, which, is, usually, attributed, to, the, icelander, snorri, sturluson, 13th, century, ce, skaldic, poetry, poetic, kennings, with, mythological, content, snorri, s, heimskringla, the, gesta, danorum, of, saxo, grammaticus, 12th, 13th, century, ce, icelandic, historical, writing, and, sagas, as, well, as, outsider, sources, such, as, the, report, on, the, rus, made, by, the, arab, traveler, ahmad, ibn, fadlan, 10th, century, the, gesta, hammaburgensis, ecclesiae, pontificum, by, bishop, adam, of, bremen, 11th, century, ce, and, various, saints, lives, germanic, religion, has, been, influenced, by, the, beliefs, of, other, cultures, celtic, and, germanic, peoples, were, in, close, contact, in, the, first, millennium, bce, and, evidence, for, celtic, influence, on, germanic, religion, is, found, in, religious, vocabulary, this, includes, for, instance, the, name, of, the, deity, un, a, raz, thor, which, is, identical, to, celtic, toranos, taranis, the, germanic, name, of, the, runes, celtic, r, na, secret, magic, and, the, germanic, name, for, the, sacred, groves, neme, az, celtic, nemeton, evidence, for, further, close, religious, contacts, is, found, in, the, roman, era, rhineland, goddesses, known, as, matronae, which, display, both, celtic, and, germanic, names, during, the, viking, age, there, is, evidence, for, continued, irish, mythological, and, insular, celtic, influence, on, norse, religion, during, the, roman, period, germanic, gods, were, equated, with, roman, gods, and, worshipped, with, roman, names, in, contact, zones, a, process, known, as, interpretatio, romana, later, germanic, names, were, also, applied, to, roman, gods, interpretatio, germanica, this, was, done, to, better, understand, one, another, s, religions, as, well, as, to, syncretize, elements, of, each, religion, this, resulted, in, various, aspects, of, roman, worship, and, iconography, being, adopted, among, the, germanic, peoples, including, those, living, at, some, distance, from, the, roman, frontier, in, later, centuries, germanic, religion, was, also, influenced, by, christianity, there, is, evidence, for, the, appropriation, of, christian, symbolism, on, gold, bracteates, and, possibly, in, the, understanding, of, the, roles, of, particular, gods, the, christianization, of, the, germanic, peoples, was, a, long, process, during, which, there, are, many, textual, and, archaeological, examples, of, the, co, existence, and, sometimes, mixture, of, pagan, and, christian, worship, and, ideas, christian, sources, frequently, equate, germanic, gods, with, demons, and, forms, of, the, devil, interpretatio, christiana, it, is, likely, that, multiple, creation, myths, existed, among, germanic, peoples, creation, myths, are, not, attested, for, the, continental, germanic, peoples, or, anglo, saxons, tacitus, includes, the, story, of, germanic, tribes, descent, from, the, gods, tuisto, or, tuisco, who, is, born, from, the, earth, and, mannus, germania, chapter, 2, resulting, in, a, division, into, three, or, five, germanic, subgroups, tuisto, appears, to, mean, twin, or, double, being, suggesting, that, he, was, a, hermaphroditic, being, capable, of, impregnating, himself, these, gods, are, only, attested, in, germania, it, is, not, possible, to, decide, based, on, tacitus, s, report, whether, the, myth, was, meant, to, describe, an, origin, of, the, gods, or, of, humans, tacitus, also, includes, a, second, myth, the, semnones, believed, that, they, originated, in, a, sacred, grove, of, fetters, where, a, particular, god, dwelled, germania, chapter, 39, for, more, on, this, see, sacred, trees, groves, and, poles, below, the, only, nordic, comprehensive, origin, myth, is, provided, by, the, prose, edda, book, gylfaginning, according, to, gylfaginning, the, first, being, was, the, giant, ymir, who, was, followed, by, the, cow, au, umbla, eventually, leading, to, the, birth, of, odin, and, his, two, brothers, the, brothers, kill, ymir, and, make, the, world, out, of, his, body, before, finally, making, the, first, man, and, woman, out, of, trees, ask, and, embla, some, scholars, suspect, that, gylfaginning, had, been, compiled, from, various, contradictory, sources, with, some, details, from, those, sources, having, been, left, out, besides, gylfaginning, the, most, important, sources, on, nordic, creation, myths, are, the, eddic, poems, v, lusp, vaf, r, nism, l, and, gr, mnism, l, the, 9th, century, old, high, german, wessobrunn, prayer, begins, with, a, series, of, negative, pairs, to, describe, the, time, before, creation, that, show, similarity, to, a, number, of, nordic, descriptions, of, the, time, before, the, world, suggesting, an, orally, transmitted, formula, there, may, be, a, continuity, between, tacitus, s, account, of, tuisto, and, mannus, and, the, gylfaginning, account, of, the, creation, of, the, world, the, name, tuisto, if, it, means, twin, or, double, being, could, connect, him, to, the, name, of, the, primordial, being, ymir, whose, name, probably, has, a, similar, meaning, on, the, other, hand, the, form, tuisco, may, suggest, a, connection, to, tyr, similarly, both, myths, have, a, genealogy, consisting, of, a, grandfather, a, father, and, then, three, sons, ymir, s, name, is, etymologically, connected, to, the, sanskrit, yama, and, iranian, yima, while, the, creation, of, the, world, from, ymir, s, body, is, paralleled, by, the, creation, of, the, world, from, the, primordial, being, purusha, in, indic, mythology, suggesting, not, only, a, proto, germanic, origin, for, ymir, but, an, even, older, indo, european, origin, see, indo, european, cosmogony, there, is, evidence, of, a, myth, of, the, end, of, the, world, in, germanic, mythology, which, can, be, reconstructed, in, very, general, terms, from, the, surviving, sources, the, best, known, is, the, myth, of, ragnar, k, attested, from, old, norse, sources, which, involves, a, war, between, the, gods, and, the, beings, of, chaos, leading, to, the, destruction, of, almost, all, gods, giants, and, living, things, in, a, cataclysm, of, fire, it, is, followed, by, a, rebirth, of, the, world, the, notion, of, the, world, s, destruction, by, fire, in, the, southern, germanic, area, seems, confirmed, by, the, existence, of, the, word, muspilli, probably, world, conflagration, to, refer, to, the, end, of, the, world, in, old, high, german, however, it, is, possible, that, this, aspect, derives, from, christian, influence, scholarship, on, ragnar, k, tends, to, either, argue, that, it, is, a, myth, with, composite, partially, non, scandinavian, origins, that, it, has, indo, european, parallels, and, thus, origins, or, that, it, derives, from, christian, influence, information, on, germanic, cosmology, is, only, provided, in, nordic, sources, but, there, is, evidence, for, considerable, continuity, of, beliefs, despite, variation, over, time, and, space, scholarship, is, marked, by, disagreement, about, whether, snorri, sturlason, s, edda, is, a, reliable, source, for, pre, christian, norse, cosmology, as, snorri, has, undoubtedly, imposed, an, ordered, christian, worldview, on, his, material, midgard, dwelling, place, in, the, middle, is, used, to, refer, to, the, inhabited, world, or, a, barrier, surrounding, the, inhabited, world, in, norse, mythology, the, term, is, first, attested, as, midjungards, in, gothic, with, wulfila, s, translation, of, the, bible, c, 370, ce, and, has, cognates, in, saxon, old, english, and, old, high, german, it, is, thus, probably, an, old, germanic, designation, in, the, prose, edda, midgard, also, seems, to, be, the, part, of, the, world, inhabited, by, the, gods, the, dwelling, place, of, the, gods, themselves, is, known, as, asgard, while, the, giants, dwell, in, lands, sometimes, referred, to, as, j, tunheimar, outside, of, midgard, the, ash, tree, yggdrasill, is, at, the, center, of, the, world, and, propped, up, the, heavens, in, the, same, way, as, the, saxon, pillar, irminsul, was, said, to, the, world, of, the, dead, hel, seems, to, have, been, underground, and, it, is, possible, that, the, realm, of, the, gods, was, originally, subterranean, as, well, the, norse, imagined, the, inhabited, world, to, be, surrounded, by, a, sort, of, dragon, or, serpent, j, rmungandr, although, only, explicitly, attested, in, scandinavian, sources, allusions, to, a, world, surrounding, monster, from, southern, germany, and, england, suggest, that, this, concept, may, have, been, common, germanic, some, christian, authors, of, the, middle, ages, such, as, bede, c, 700, and, thietmar, of, merseburg, c, 1000, attribute, a, strong, belief, in, fate, and, chance, to, the, followers, of, germanic, religion, similarly, old, english, old, high, german, and, old, saxon, associate, a, word, for, fate, wyrd, as, referring, to, an, inescapable, impersonal, fate, or, death, while, scholarship, of, the, early, 20th, century, believed, that, this, meant, that, germanic, religion, was, essentially, fatalistic, scholars, since, 1969, have, noted, that, this, concept, appears, to, have, been, heavily, influenced, by, the, christianized, greco, roman, notion, of, fortuna, fatalis, fatal, fortune, rather, than, reflecting, germanic, belief, nevertheless, norse, myth, attests, the, belief, that, even, the, gods, were, subject, to, fate, while, it, is, thus, clear, that, older, scholarship, exaggerated, the, importance, of, fate, in, germanic, religion, it, still, had, its, own, concept, of, fate, most, norse, texts, dealing, with, fate, are, heroic, which, probably, influences, their, portrayal, of, fate, in, norse, myth, fate, was, created, by, supernatural, female, beings, called, norns, who, appear, either, individually, or, as, a, collective, and, who, give, people, their, fate, at, birth, and, are, somehow, involved, in, their, deaths, other, female, beings, the, disir, and, valkyries, were, also, associated, with, fate, early, germanic, beliefs, about, the, afterlife, are, not, well, known, however, the, sources, indicate, a, variety, of, beliefs, including, belief, in, an, underworld, continued, life, in, the, grave, a, world, of, the, dead, in, the, sky, and, reincarnation, beliefs, varied, by, time, and, place, and, may, have, contradictory, in, the, same, time, and, place, the, two, most, important, afterlives, in, the, attested, corpus, were, located, at, hel, and, valhalla, while, additional, destinations, for, the, dead, are, also, mentioned, a, number, of, sources, refer, to, hel, as, the, general, abode, of, the, dead, the, old, norse, proper, noun, hel, and, its, cognates, in, other, germanic, languages, are, used, for, the, christian, hell, but, they, originally, refer, to, a, germanic, underworld, and, or, afterlife, location, that, predates, christianization, its, relation, to, the, west, germanic, verb, helan, to, hide, suggests, that, it, may, have, originally, referred, to, the, grave, itself, it, could, also, suggest, the, idea, that, the, realm, of, the, dead, is, hidden, from, human, view, it, was, not, conceived, of, as, a, place, of, punishment, until, the, high, middle, ages, when, it, takes, on, some, characteristics, of, the, christian, hell, it, is, described, as, cold, dark, and, in, the, north, valhalla, hall, of, the, slain, on, the, other, hand, is, a, hall, in, asgard, where, the, illustrious, dead, dwell, with, odin, feasting, and, fighting, old, norse, material, often, include, the, notion, that, the, dead, lived, in, their, graves, and, that, they, can, sometimes, come, back, as, revenants, several, inscriptions, in, the, elder, futhark, found, on, stones, marking, graves, seem, intended, to, prevent, this, the, concept, of, the, wild, hunt, of, the, dead, first, attested, in, the, 11th, century, is, found, throughout, the, germanic, speaking, regions, in, germanic, mythology, the, numbers, three, nine, and, twelve, play, an, important, role, the, symbolic, importance, of, the, number, three, is, attested, widely, among, many, cultures, and, the, number, twelve, is, also, attested, as, significant, in, other, cultures, meaning, that, foreign, influence, is, possible, the, number, three, often, occurs, as, a, symbol, of, completeness, which, is, probably, how, the, frequent, use, in, germanic, religion, of, triads, of, gods, or, giants, should, be, understood, groups, of, three, gods, are, mentioned, in, a, number, of, sources, including, adam, of, bremen, the, nordendorf, fibula, the, old, saxon, baptismal, formula, gylfaginning, and, orsteins, ttr, uxaf, ts, the, number, nine, can, be, understood, as, three, threes, its, importance, is, attested, in, both, mythology, and, worship, the, germanic, gods, were, a, category, of, supernatural, beings, who, interacted, with, humans, as, well, as, with, other, supernatural, beings, such, as, giants, j, tnar, elves, and, dwarfs, the, distinction, between, gods, and, other, supernaturally, powerful, beings, might, not, always, be, clear, unlike, the, christian, god, the, germanic, gods, were, born, can, die, and, are, unable, to, change, the, fate, of, the, world, the, gods, had, mostly, human, features, with, human, forms, male, or, female, gender, and, familial, relationships, and, lived, in, a, society, organized, like, human, society, however, their, sight, hearing, and, strength, were, superhuman, and, they, possessed, a, superhuman, ability, to, influence, the, world, within, the, religion, they, functioned, as, helpers, of, humans, granting, heil, good, luck, good, fortune, for, correct, religious, observance, the, adjectival, form, heilag, english, holy, is, attested, in, all, germanic, languages, including, gothic, on, the, ring, of, pietroassa, based, on, old, norse, evidence, germanic, paganism, probably, had, a, variety, of, words, to, refer, to, gods, words, descended, from, proto, germanic, ansuz, the, origin, of, the, old, norse, family, of, gods, known, as, the, aesir, singular, ss, are, attested, as, a, name, for, divine, beings, from, around, the, germanic, world, the, earliest, attestations, are, the, name, of, a, war, goddess, vih, ansa, battle, goddess, that, appears, on, a, roman, inscription, from, tongeren, with, a, second, early, attestion, on, a, runic, belt, buckle, found, at, vimose, denmark, from, around, 200, ce, the, historian, jordanes, mentions, the, latinized, form, anses, in,

the, indo, european, word, for, god, deiuos, is, only, found, in, old, norse, where, it, occurs, as, t, r, it, mostly, appears, in, the, plural, t, var, or, in, compound, bynames, in, norse, mythology, the, aesir, are, one, of, two, families, of, gods, the, other, being, the, vanir, the, most, important, gods, of, norse, mythology, belong, to, the, aesir, and, the, term, can, also, be, used, for, the, gods, in, general, the, vanir, appear, to, have, been, mostly, fertility, gods, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, existence, of, a, separate, vanir, family, of, gods, outside, of, icelandic, mythological, texts, namely, the, eddic, poem, v, lusp, and, snorri, sturluson, s, prose, edda, and, ynglinga, saga, these, sources, detail, a, mythical, sir, vanir, war, which, however, is, portrayed, quite, differently, in, the, different, accounts, giants, j, tnar, play, a, significant, role, in, germanic, myth, as, preserved, in, iceland, being, just, as, important, as, the, gods, in, myths, of, the, cosmology, and, the, creation, and, the, end, of, the, world, they, appear, to, have, been, various, types, of, powerful, non, divine, supernatural, beings, who, lived, in, a, kind, of, wilderness, and, were, mostly, hostile, to, humans, and, gods, they, have, human, form, and, live, in, families, but, can, sometimes, take, on, animal, form, in, addition, to, old, norse, j, tnar, the, beings, are, also, commonly, referred, to, as, ursar, both, terms, having, cognates, in, west, germanic, j, tunn, is, probably, derived, from, the, verb, to, eat, either, referring, to, their, strength, or, possibly, to, cannibalism, as, a, characteristic, trait, of, giants, giants, often, have, a, special, association, with, some, phenomena, of, nature, such, as, frost, mountains, water, and, fire, scholars, are, divided, as, to, whether, there, were, any, religious, offerings, or, rituals, offered, to, giants, in, germanic, religion, scholars, such, as, gro, steisland, and, nanna, l, kka, have, suggested, that, the, division, of, the, gods, from, giants, is, not, actually, very, clear, germanic, religion, also, contained, various, other, mythological, beings, such, as, the, monstrous, wolf, fenrir, as, well, as, beings, such, as, elves, dwarfs, and, other, non, divine, supernatural, beings, elves, are, beings, of, germanic, lower, mythology, that, are, mostly, male, and, appear, as, a, collective, snorri, sturluson, divides, the, elves, into, two, groups, the, dark, elves, and, the, light, elves, however, this, division, is, not, attested, elsewhere, people, s, understanding, of, elves, varied, by, time, and, place, in, some, instances, they, were, godlike, beings, in, others, dead, ancestors, nature, spirits, or, demons, in, norse, pagan, belief, elves, seem, to, have, been, worshipped, to, some, extent, the, concept, of, elves, begins, to, differ, between, scandinavia, and, the, west, germanic, peoples, in, the, middle, ages, possibly, under, celtic, influence, in, anglo, saxon, england, elves, seem, to, have, been, potentially, dangerous, powerful, supernatural, beings, associated, with, woods, fields, hills, and, bodies, of, water, like, elves, dwarfs, are, beings, of, germanic, lower, mythology, they, are, mostly, male, and, imagined, as, a, collective, however, individual, named, dwarfs, also, play, an, important, role, in, norse, mythology, in, norse, and, german, texts, dwarfs, live, in, mountains, and, are, known, as, great, smiths, and, craftsmen, they, may, have, originally, been, nature, spirits, or, demons, of, death, snorri, sturluson, equates, the, dwarfs, to, a, subgroup, of, the, elves, and, many, high, medieval, german, epics, and, some, old, norse, myths, give, dwarfs, names, with, the, word, alp, or, lf, elf, in, them, suggesting, some, confusion, between, the, two, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, dwarfs, were, worshipped, in, anglo, saxon, england, dwarfs, were, potentially, dangerous, supernatural, beings, associated, with, madness, fever, and, dementia, and, have, no, known, association, with, mountains, dragons, occur, in, germanic, mythology, with, norse, examples, including, n, h, ggr, and, the, world, serpent, j, rmungandr, in, the, late, sources, for, scandinavian, religion, dragons, play, an, important, role, in, the, mythic, cosmology, it, is, difficult, to, tell, how, much, existing, sources, have, been, influenced, by, greco, roman, and, christian, ideas, about, dragons, based, on, the, native, word, old, high, german, lintwurm, related, to, old, norse, linnr, snake, the, early, description, in, beowulf, and, early, pictorial, depictions, they, were, probably, imagined, as, snake, like, and, of, large, size, able, to, spit, poison, or, fire, and, dwelled, under, the, earth, scholarly, consensus, is, that, germanic, dragons, were, originally, more, snake, or, worm, like, and, could, not, fly, but, that, the, idea, of, flying, dragons, entered, from, greco, roman, culture, the, medieval, germanic, languages, did, not, distinguish, linguistically, or, conceptually, between, snakes, and, dragons, in, their, mythology, due, to, the, scarcity, of, sources, and, the, origin, of, the, germanic, gods, over, a, broad, period, of, time, and, in, different, locations, it, is, not, possible, to, reconstruct, a, full, pantheon, of, germanic, deities, that, is, valid, for, germanic, religion, everywhere, this, is, only, possible, for, the, last, stage, of, germanic, religion, norse, paganism, people, in, different, times, and, places, would, have, worshiped, different, individual, gods, and, groups, of, gods, placename, evidence, containing, divine, names, gives, some, indication, of, which, gods, were, important, in, particular, regions, however, such, names, are, not, well, attested, or, researched, outside, scandinavia, the, following, section, first, includes, some, information, on, the, gods, attested, during, the, roman, period, then, the, four, main, germanic, gods, tiwaz, tyr, thunraz, thor, wodanaz, odin, and, frijj, frigg, who, are, securely, attested, since, the, early, middle, ages, but, were, probably, worshiped, during, roman, times, and, finally, some, information, on, other, gods, many, of, whom, are, only, attested, in, norse, paganism, the, roman, authors, julius, caesar, and, tacitus, both, use, roman, names, to, describe, foreign, gods, but, whereas, caesar, claims, the, germani, worshiped, no, individual, gods, but, only, natural, phenomena, such, as, the, sun, moon, and, fire, tacitus, mentions, a, number, of, deities, saying, that, the, most, worshiped, god, is, mercury, followed, by, hercules, and, mars, he, also, mentions, isis, odysseus, and, laertes, scholars, generally, interpret, mercury, as, meaning, odin, hercules, as, meaning, thor, and, mars, as, meaning, tyr, as, these, names, are, only, attested, much, later, however, there, is, some, doubt, about, these, identifications, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, gods, tacitus, names, were, not, worshiped, by, all, germanic, peoples, or, that, he, has, transferred, information, about, the, gauls, to, the, germans, the, germani, themselves, also, worshiped, gods, with, roman, names, at, votive, altars, constructed, according, to, roman, tradition, while, isolated, instances, of, germanic, bynames, such, as, mars, thingsus, indicate, that, a, germanic, god, was, meant, often, it, is, not, possible, to, know, if, the, roman, god, or, a, germanic, equivalent, is, meant, most, surviving, dedications, are, to, mercury, female, deities, on, the, other, hand, were, not, given, roman, names, additionally, the, germanic, speakers, also, translated, roman, gods, names, into, their, own, languages, interpretatio, germanica, most, prominently, in, the, germanic, days, of, the, week, usually, the, translation, of, the, days, of, the, week, is, dated, to, the, 3rd, or, 4th, century, ce, however, they, are, not, attested, until, the, early, middle, ages, this, late, attestation, causes, some, scholars, to, question, the, usefulness, of, the, days, of, the, week, for, reconstructing, early, germanic, religion, tacitus, mentions, a, divine, pair, of, twins, called, the, alcis, worshipped, by, the, naharvali, whom, he, compares, to, the, roman, twin, horsemen, castor, and, pollux, these, twins, can, be, associated, with, the, indo, european, myth, of, the, divine, twin, horsemen, dioscuri, attested, in, various, indo, european, cultures, among, later, germanic, peoples, twin, founding, figures, such, as, hengist, and, horsa, allude, to, the, motif, of, the, divine, twins, hengist, and, horsa, s, names, both, mean, horse, strengthening, the, connection, in, scandinavia, images, of, divine, twins, are, attested, from, 15th, century, bce, until, the, 8th, century, ce, after, which, they, disappear, apparently, as, a, result, of, religious, change, norse, texts, contain, no, identifiable, divine, twins, though, scholars, have, looked, for, parallels, among, gods, and, heroes, in, germania, tacitus, mentions, that, the, lombards, and, suebi, venerated, a, goddess, nerthus, and, describes, the, rites, of, the, goddess, in, some, detail, at, their, center, is, a, ceremonial, wagon, procession, nerthus, s, cart, is, found, on, an, unspecified, island, in, the, ocean, where, it, is, kept, in, a, sacred, grove, and, draped, in, white, cloth, only, a, priest, may, touch, it, when, the, priest, detects, nerthus, s, presence, by, the, cart, the, cart, is, drawn, by, heifers, nerthus, s, cart, is, met, with, celebration, and, peacetime, everywhere, it, goes, and, during, her, procession, no, one, goes, to, war, and, all, iron, objects, are, locked, away, in, time, after, the, goddess, has, had, her, fill, of, human, company, the, priest, returns, the, cart, to, her, temple, and, slaves, ritually, wash, the, goddess, her, cart, and, the, cloth, in, a, secluded, lake, according, to, tacitus, the, slaves, are, then, immediately, drowned, in, the, lake, the, majority, of, modern, scholars, identify, nerthus, as, a, direct, etymological, precursor, to, the, old, norse, deity, nj, r, r, attested, over, a, thousand, years, later, however, nj, r, r, is, attested, as, male, leading, to, many, proposals, regarding, this, apparent, change, such, as, incest, motifs, described, among, the, vanir, a, group, of, gods, to, which, nj, r, r, belongs, in, old, norse, sources, collectives, of, three, goddess, known, as, matronae, appear, on, numerous, votive, altars, from, the, roman, province, of, germania, inferior, especially, from, cologne, dating, to, the, third, and, fourth, centuries, ce, the, altars, depict, three, women, in, non, roman, dress, about, half, of, serving, matronae, altars, can, be, identified, as, germanic, because, of, their, bynames, other, have, latin, or, celtic, bynames, the, bynames, are, often, connected, to, a, place, or, ethnic, group, but, a, number, are, associated, with, water, and, many, of, them, seem, to, indicate, a, giving, and, protecting, nature, despite, their, frequency, in, the, archaeological, record, the, matronae, receive, no, mention, in, any, written, source, the, matronae, may, be, connected, to, female, deities, attested, in, collectives, from, later, times, such, as, the, norns, the, disir, and, valkyries, rudolf, simek, suggests, that, a, connection, to, the, disir, is, most, likely, the, disir, may, be, etymologically, connected, to, minor, hindu, deities, known, as, dhisan, s, who, likewise, appear, in, a, group, this, would, give, them, an, indo, european, origin, since, jacob, grimm, scholars, have, sought, to, connect, the, disir, with, the, idisi, found, in, the, old, high, german, first, merseburg, charm, and, with, a, conjecturally, corrected, place, name, from, tacitus, however, these, connections, are, contested, the, disir, share, some, functions, with, the, norns, and, valkyries, and, the, nordic, sources, suggest, a, close, association, between, the, three, groups, of, norse, minor, female, deities, further, connections, of, the, matronae, have, been, proposed, the, anglo, saxon, pagan, festival, of, modranicht, night, of, the, mothers, mentioned, by, bede, has, been, associated, with, the, matronae, likewise, the, poorly, attested, anglo, saxon, goddesses, eostre, and, rheda, may, be, connected, with, the, matronae, besides, nerthus, tacitus, elsewhere, mentions, other, important, female, deities, worshiped, by, the, germanic, peoples, such, as, tamfana, by, the, marsi, annals, 1, 50, and, the, mother, of, the, gods, mater, deum, by, the, aestii, germania, chapter, 45, in, addition, to, the, collective, matronae, votive, altars, from, roman, germania, attest, a, number, of, individual, goddesses, a, goddess, nehelenia, is, attested, on, numerous, votive, altars, from, the, 3rd, century, ce, on, the, rhine, islands, of, walcheren, and, noord, beveland, as, well, as, at, cologne, dedicatory, inscriptions, to, nehelenia, make, up, 15, of, all, extant, dedications, to, gods, from, the, roman, province, germania, inferior, and, 50, of, dedications, to, female, deities, she, appears, to, have, been, associated, with, trade, and, commerce, and, was, possibly, a, chthonic, deity, she, is, usually, depicted, with, baskets, of, fruit, a, dog, or, the, prow, of, a, ship, or, an, oar, her, attributes, are, shared, with, the, hellenistic, egyptian, goddess, isis, suggesting, a, connection, to, the, isis, of, the, suebi, mentioned, by, tacitus, despite, her, obvious, importance, she, is, not, attested, in, later, periods, another, goddess, hludana, is, also, attested, from, five, votive, inscriptions, along, the, rhine, her, name, is, cognate, with, old, norse, hl, yn, one, of, the, names, of, j, r, earth, the, mother, of, thor, it, has, thus, been, suggested, she, may, have, been, a, chthonic, deity, possibly, also, connected, to, later, attested, figures, such, as, hel, huld, and, frau, holle, the, god, tiwaz, tyr, may, be, attested, as, early, as, 450, 350, bce, on, the, negau, helmet, etymologically, his, name, is, related, to, the, vedic, dyaus, and, greek, zeus, indicating, an, origin, in, the, reconstructed, indo, european, sky, deity, dy, us, he, is, thus, the, only, attested, germanic, god, who, was, already, important, in, indo, european, times, when, the, days, of, the, week, were, translated, into, germanic, tyr, was, associated, with, the, roman, god, mars, so, that, dies, martis, day, of, mars, became, tuesday, day, of, tiwaz, tyr, a, votive, inscription, to, mars, thingsus, mars, of, the, thing, suggests, he, also, had, a, connection, to, the, legal, sphere, scholars, generally, believe, that, tyr, became, less, and, less, important, in, the, scandinavian, branch, of, germanic, paganism, over, time, and, had, largely, ceased, to, be, worshiped, by, the, viking, age, he, plays, a, major, role, in, only, one, myth, the, binding, of, the, monstrous, wolf, fenrir, during, which, tyr, loses, his, hand, thor, was, the, most, widely, known, and, perhaps, the, most, widely, worshiped, god, in, viking, age, scandinavia, when, the, days, of, the, week, were, translated, into, germanic, he, was, associated, with, jupiter, so, that, dies, jovis, day, of, jupiter, becomes, thursday, this, contradicts, the, earlier, interpretatio, romana, where, thor, is, generally, thought, to, be, hercules, textual, sources, such, as, adam, of, bremen, as, well, as, the, association, with, jupiter, in, the, interpretatio, germanica, suggest, he, may, have, been, the, head, of, the, pantheon, at, least, in, some, times, and, places, alternatively, thor, s, hammer, may, have, been, equated, with, jupiter, s, lightning, bolt, outside, of, scandinavia, he, appears, on, the, nordendorf, fibulae, 6th, or, 7th, century, ce, and, in, the, old, saxon, baptismal, vow, 9th, century, ce, the, oak, of, jupiter, destroyed, by, saint, boniface, among, the, chatti, in, 723, ce, is, also, usually, presumed, to, have, been, dedicated, to, thor, viking, age, runestones, as, well, as, the, nordendorf, fibulae, appear, to, call, upon, thor, to, bless, objects, the, most, important, archaeological, evidence, for, the, worship, of, thor, in, viking, age, scandinavia, is, found, in, the, form, of, thor, s, hammer, pendants, myths, about, thor, are, only, attested, from, scandinavia, and, it, is, unclear, how, representative, the, nordic, corpus, is, for, the, entire, germanic, region, as, thor, s, name, means, thunder, scholars, since, jacob, grimm, have, interpreted, him, to, be, a, sky, and, weather, god, in, norse, mythology, he, shares, features, with, other, indo, european, thunder, gods, including, his, slaying, of, monsters, these, features, likely, derive, from, a, common, indo, european, source, in, the, extant, mythology, of, thor, however, he, has, very, little, association, with, thunder, odin, wodanaz, plays, the, main, role, in, a, number, of, myths, as, well, as, well, attested, norse, rituals, he, appears, to, have, been, venerated, by, many, germanic, peoples, in, the, early, middle, ages, though, his, exact, characteristics, probably, varied, in, different, times, and, places, in, the, germanic, days, of, the, week, odin, is, equated, with, mercury, dies, mercurii, which, became, wednesday, an, association, that, accords, with, the, usual, scholarly, interpretation, of, the, interpretatio, romana, and, is, also, found, in, early, medieval, authors, it, may, have, been, inspired, by, both, gods, connections, to, arcane, knowledge, and, the, dead, the, age, of, the, cult, of, odin, is, disputed, the, earliest, clear, reference, to, odin, by, name, is, found, on, a, c, bracteate, discovered, in, denmark, in, 2020, dated, to, as, early, as, the, 400s, the, bracteate, features, a, proto, norse, elder, futhark, inscription, reading, he, is, odin, s, man, archaeological, evidence, for, odin, is, found, in, the, form, of, his, later, bynames, on, runic, inscriptions, found, in, danish, bogs, from, 4th, or, 5th, century, ad, other, possible, archaeological, attestations, may, date, to, the, 3rd, century, ce, images, of, odin, dating, to, the, late, migration, period, are, known, from, frisia, but, appear, to, have, come, there, from, scandinavia, in, norse, myths, odin, plays, one, of, the, most, important, roles, of, all, the, gods, he, is, also, attested, in, myths, outside, of, the, norse, area, in, the, mid, 7th, century, ce, the, franco, burgundian, chronicler, fredegar, narrates, that, wodan, gave, the, lombards, their, name, this, story, also, appears, in, the, roughly, contemporary, origo, gentis, langobardorum, and, later, in, the, historia, langobardorum, of, paul, the, deacon, 790, ce, in, germany, odin, is, attested, as, part, of, a, divine, triad, on, the, nordendorf, fibulae, and, the, second, merseburg, charm, in, which, he, heals, balder, s, horse, in, england, he, appears, as, a, healing, magician, in, the, nine, herbs, charm, and, in, anglo, saxon, genealogies, it, is, disputed, whether, he, was, worshiped, among, the, goths, the, only, major, norse, goddess, also, found, in, the, pre, viking, period, is, frigg, odin, s, wife, when, the, germanic, days, of, the, week, were, translated, frigg, was, equated, with, venus, so, that, dies, veneris, day, of, venus, became, friday, day, of, frijj, frigg, this, translation, suggests, a, connection, to, fertility, and, sexuality, and, her, name, is, etymologically, derived, from, an, indo, european, root, meaning, love, in, the, stories, of, how, the, lombards, got, their, name, frea, frigg, plays, an, important, role, in, tricking, her, husband, vodan, odin, into, giving, the, lombards, victory, she, is, also, mentioned, in, the, merseburg, charms, where, she, displays, magical, abilities, the, only, norse, myth, in, which, frigg, plays, a, major, role, is, the, death, of, baldr, and, there, is, only, little, evidence, for, a, cult, of, frigg, in, scandinavia, the, god, baldr, is, attested, from, scandinavia, england, and, germany, except, for, the, old, high, german, second, merseburg, charm, 9th, century, ce, all, literary, references, to, the, god, are, from, scandinavia, and, nothing, is, known, of, his, worship, the, god, freyr, was, the, most, important, fertility, god, of, the, viking, age, he, is, sometimes, known, as, yngvi, freyr, which, would, associate, him, with, the, god, or, hero, ingwaz, the, presumed, progenitor, of, the, inguaeones, found, in, tacitus, s, germania, whose, name, is, attested, in, the, old, english, rune, poem, 8th, or, 9th, century, ce, as, ing, a, minor, god, named, forseti, is, attested, in, a, few, old, norse, sources, he, is, generally, associated, with, the, frisian, god, fosite, who, was, worshiped, on, helgoland, but, this, connection, is, uncertain, the, old, saxon, baptismal, formula, and, some, old, english, genealogies, mention, a, god, saxnot, who, appears, to, be, the, founder, of, the, saxons, some, scholars, identify, him, as, a, form, of, tyr, while, others, propose, that, he, may, be, a, form, of, freyr, the, most, important, goddess, in, the, recorded, old, norse, pantheon, was, freyr, s, sister, freyja, who, features, in, more, myths, and, appears, to, have, been, worshiped, more, than, frigg, odin, s, wife, she, was, associated, with, sexuality, and, fertility, as, well, as, war, death, and, magic, it, is, unclear, how, old, the, worship, of, freyja, is, and, there, is, no, indisputable, evidence, for, her, or, any, of, the, vanir, gods, in, the, southern, germanic, area, there, is, considerable, debate, about, whether, frigg, and, freyja, were, originally, the, same, goddess, or, aspects, of, the, same, goddess, besides, freyja, many, gods, and, goddesses, are, only, known, from, scandinavia, including, gir, h, r, h, nir, heimdall, idunn, loki, nj, r, r, sif, and, ullr, there, are, a, number, of, minor, or, regional, gods, mentioned, in, various, medieval, norse, sources, in, some, cases, it, is, unclear, whether, or, not, they, are, post, conversion, literary, creations, many, regional, or, highly, local, gods, and, spirits, are, probably, not, mentioned, in, the, sources, at, all, it, is, also, likely, that, many, roman, era, and, continental, germanic, gods, do, not, appear, in, norse, mythology, julius, caesar, and, tacitus, claimed, that, the, germani, did, not, venerate, their, gods, in, human, form, however, this, is, a, topos, of, ancient, ethnography, when, describing, supposedly, primitive, people, archaeologists, have, found, germanic, statues, that, appear, to, depict, gods, and, tacitus, appears, to, contradict, himself, when, discussing, the, cult, of, nerthus, germania, chapter, 40, the, eddic, poem, h, vam, l, also, mentions, wooden, statues, of, gods, while, gregory, of, tours, historia, francorum, ii, 29, mentions, wooden, statues, and, ones, made, of, stone, and, metal, archaeologists, have, not, found, any, divine, statues, dating, from, after, the, end, of, the, migration, period, it, is, likely, that, they, were, destroyed, during, christianization, as, is, repeatedly, depicted, in, the, norse, sagas, roughly, carved, wooden, male, and, female, figures, that, may, depict, gods, are, frequent, finds, in, bogs, these, figures, generally, follow, the, natural, form, of, a, branch, it, is, unclear, whether, the, figures, themselves, were, sacrifices, or, if, they, were, the, beings, to, whom, the, sacrifice, was, given, most, date, from, the, first, several, centuries, ce, for, the, pre, roman, iron, age, board, like, statues, that, were, set, up, in, dangerous, places, encountered, in, everyday, life, are, also, attested, most, statues, were, made, out, of, oak, wood, small, animal, figurines, of, cattle, and, horses, are, also, found, in, bogs, some, may, have, been, worn, as, amulets, while, others, seem, to, have, been, placed, by, hearths, before, they, were, sacrificed, holy, sites, from, the, migration, period, frequently, contain, gold, bracteates, and, gold, foil, figures, that, depict, obviously, divine, figures, the, bracteates, are, originally, based, on, motifs, found, on, roman, gold, medallions, and, coins, of, the, era, of, constantine, the, great, but, have, become, highly, stylized, a, few, them, have, runic, inscriptions, that, may, be, names, of, odin, others, such, as, trollh, tten, a, may, display, scenes, known, from, later, mythological, texts, the, stone, altars, of, the, matronae, and, nehalennia, show, women, in, germanic, dress, but, otherwise, follow, roman, models, while, images, of, mercury, hercules, or, mars, do, not, show, any, difference, from, roman, models, many, bronze, and, silver, statues, of, roman, gods, have, been, found, throughout, germania, some, made, by, the, germani, themselves, suggesting, an, appropriation, of, these, figures, by, the, germani, heiko, steuer, suggests, that, these, statues, likely, were, reinterpreted, as, local, germanic, gods, and, used, on, home, altars, a, find, from, odense, dating, c, 100, 300, ce, includes, statues, of, mercury, mars, jupiter, and, apollo, imported, roman, swords, found, from, scandinavia, to, the, black, sea, frequently, depicted, the, roman, god, mars, ultor, mars, the, avenger, caesar, and, tacitus, claimed, that, the, ancient, germans, had, no, temples, and, only, worshipped, in, sacred, groves, however, while, groves, trees, bogs, springs, and, lakes, undoubtedly, were, seen, as, holy, places, by, the, germani, there, is, archaeological, evidence, for, temples, archaeology, also, indicates, that, neolithic, structures, and, bronze, age, tumuli, were, used, as, places, of, worship, steuer, argues, that, finds, of, sacrificial, places, enclosed, with, a, palisade, in, england, indicate, that, similarly, enclosed, areas, in, northern, germany, and, jutland, may, have, been, holy, sites, large, fire, pits, near, settlements, found, in, many, sites, including, those, from, the, bronze, age, the, pre, roman, iron, age, and, the, migration, period, probably, served, as, ritual, political, and, social, locations, large, halls, in, settlements, probably, also, fulfilled, ceremonial, religious, functions, tacitus, mentions, a, temple, of, the, goddess, tamfana, in, annales, 1, 51, and, also, uses, the, word, templum, in, reference, to, nerthus, in, germania, though, this, could, simply, mean, a, consecrated, place, rather, than, a, building, later, christian, sources, refer, to, temples, fana, used, by, the, franks, lombards, continental, saxons, and, anglo, saxons, while, the, post, conversion, lex, frisionum, frisian, law, continued, to, include, punishments, for, those, who, broke, into, or, desecrated, temples, a, temple, dedicated, to, hercules, from, the, territory, of, the, batavi, at, empel, in, the, netherlands, shows, a, typical, romano, celtic, building, style, other, roman, style, temples, dedicated, to, the, matronae, are, known, from, the, lower, rhine, region, an, early, scandinavian, temple, has, been, identified, at, upp, kra, modern, sweden, the, building, a, very, large, hall, with, two, entrances, was, rebuilt, on, exactly, the, same, site, 7, times, from, 200, to, 950, ce, architecturally, the, temple, resembles, later, scandinavian, stave, churches, in, construction, the, building, was, surrounded, by, animal, bones, and, a, few, human, bones, a, similar, building, has, been, found, at, m, lleb, kvej, on, zealand, dating, from, the, 3rd, century, ce, while, the, later, stages, of, a, ritual, house, at, tiss, in, zealand, 850, 950, ce, likewise, resemble, a, stave, church, the, most, important, description, of, a, scandinavian, temple, is, of, the, temple, of, uppsala, by, adam, of, bremen, 11th, century, he, describes, the, temple, as, containing, the, idols, of, borr, thor, odin, and, frey, fricco, glosses, mention, the, existence, of, a, large, tree, and, well, nearby, where, sacrifices, were, made, some, aspects, of, adam, s, description, appear, to, be, inaccurate, possibly, influenced, by, norse, mythology, archaeology, has, shown, that, uppsala, became, an, important, cult, center, around, 500, ce, with, a, main, royal, hall, dating, from, 600, to, 800, ce, and, having, large, doors, with, iron, spirals, flat, against, the, wood, four, large, grave, mounds, were, constructed, southwest, of, the, main, hall, and, there, were, ritual, roads, with, rows, of, large, wooden, posts, and, lines, of, fireplaces, the, arrangements, indicate, that, there, were, different, processions, and, rituals, both, inside, and, around, gamla, uppsala, the, only, material, remains, from, the, rituals, once, performed, there, are, of, animals, the, age, of, the, animals, indicates, that, they, were, deposited, in, march, which, agrees, with, the, written, sources, on, the, d, sabl, t, sacred, trees, occur, as, important, symbols, in, many, pre, modern, cultures, particularly, those, of, indo, european, origin, modern, scholars, on, the, basis, of, greco, roman, religious, understanding, usually, distinguish, between, sacred, groves, and, trees, where, a, god, is, worshiped, and, the, worship, of, trees, as, divine, tree, cult, it, is, unclear, whether, this, distinction, is, valid, for, germanic, religion, tacitus, describes, the, ancient, germani, as, worshiping, in, sacred, groves, including, the, grove, of, fetters, of, the, semnones, and, the, grove, where, the, alcis, were, worshipped, by, the, nahanarvali, tacitus, mentions, the, following, functions, for, germanic, sacred, groves, the, display, of, captured, enemy, standards, and, weapons, the, keeping, of, the, animal, shaped, standards, of, the, batavii, tac, hist, 4, 22, and, human, sacrifice, reconstructed, germanic, words, for, sacred, groves, include, nimi, alh, and, haruh, which, may, have, originally, described, different, functions, of, the, groves, physical, trees, or, poles, could, represent, either, a, world, tree, yggdrasil, in, norse, mythology, or, a, world, pillar, modern, scholars, describe, such, a, sacred, tree, as, an, axis, mundi, hub, of, the, world, a, center, that, runs, along, and, connects, multiple, levels, of, the, universe, while, also, representing, the, world, itself, in, roman, germania, columns, depicting, the, god, jupiter, as, a, rider, are, commonly, found, they, probably, have, a, celtic, background, and, some, connection, to, the, notion, of, the, world, tree, or, column, one, example, of, a, sacred, tree, during, the, middle, ages, is, the, oak, of, jupiter, purportedly, felled, by, saint, boniface, in, 724, ce, in, hesse, adam, of, bremen, mentions, a, sacred, tree, at, the, temple, of, uppsala, but, the, existence, of, this, tree, is, controversial, among, scholars, it, is, also, mentioned, in, hervarar, saga, and, it, may, have, been, the, central, focus, at, the, site, and, represented, the, world, tree, yggdrasil, further, support, for, the, existence, of, votive, trees, is, provided, by, a, birch, root, surrounded, by, animal, skulls, that, was, excavated, at, fr, s, pagan, anglo, saxon, settlements, often, contained, large, standing, poles, which, were, condemned, as, focuses, of, pagan, worship, by, 6th, century, english, bishop, aldhelm, the, irminsul, old, saxon, great, pillar, among, the, continental, saxons, may, have, also, been, part, of, such, a, pole, cult, post, conversion, norse, texts, mention, dedicated, groups, of, warriors, some, of, whom, the, berserkir, berserkers, and, ulfhe, nar, were, associated, with, bears, and, wolves, respectively, in, ynglinga, saga, snorri, sturluson, associates, these, warriors, with, odin, many, scholars, argue, that, warrior, bands, with, their, initiation, rites, and, forms, of, organization, can, be, traced, to, the, time, of, tacitus, who, discusses, several, warrior, bands, and, societies, among, the, germani, these, scholars, further, argue, that, these, bands, can, be, traced, further, back, to, proto, indo, european, precursors, to, some, extent, other, scholars, such, as, hans, kuhn, dispute, continuity, between, norse, and, earlier, warrior, bands, inhumation, and, cremation, graves, containing, bear, claws, teeth, and, hides, are, found, throughout, the, germanic, speaking, area, being, especially, common, on, the, elbe, from, 100, bce, to, 100, ce, and, in, scandinavia, from, the, 2nd, to, 5th, centuries, ce, these, may, be, connected, to, the, warrior, societies, archaeologists, have, found, metal, objects, especially, on, weapons, and, brooches, decorated, with, animal, art, and, dating, from, the, 4th, to, the, 12th, centuries, ce, in, scandinavia, animals, depicted, include, snakes, birds, of, prey, wolves, and, boars, some, scholars, have, discussed, these, images, as, related, to, shamanism, while, others, view, animal, art, as, similar, to, skaldic, kennings, capable, of, expressing, both, christian, and, pagan, meanings, scholars, are, divided, as, to, the, nature, and, function, of, germanic, ritual, specialists, many, religious, studies, scholars, believe, that, there, was, originally, no, class, of, priests, and, cultic, functions, were, mostly, carried, out, by, kings, and, chieftains, many, philologists, however, argue, on, the, basis, of, reconstructed, words, for, priest, that, a, specialized, class, of, priests, existed, caesar, says, the, germani, had, no, druids, while, tacitus, mentions, several, priests, roman, sources, do, not, otherwise, mention, germanic, cultic, functionaries, later, descriptions, of, similar, rituals, to, those, mentioned, in, tacitus, do, not, mention, any, ritual, specialists, however, it, is, reasonable, to, assume, that, they, continued, to, exist, while, ritual, specialists, in, viking, age, scandinavia, may, have, had, defining, insignia, such, as, staffs, and, oath, rings, it, is, unclear, if, they, formed, a, hierarchy, and, they, seem, to, have, fulfilled, non, cultic, roles, in, society, as, well, caesar, and, tacitus, both, mention, women, engaged, in, casting, lots, and, prophecy, and, there, are, some, other, indications, of, female, ritual, specialists, tacitus, and, the, roman, writer, cassius, dio, 163, c, 229, ce, both, mention, several, seeresses, by, name, while, an, ostracon, from, egypt, attests, one, living, in, the, second, century, ce, a, female, ritual, specialist, named, gambara, appears, in, paul, the, deacon, 8th, century, a, gap, in, the, historical, record, occurs, until, the, north, germanic, record, began, over, a, millennium, later, when, the, old, norse, sagas, frequently, mention, female, ritual, specialists, among, the, north, germanic, peoples, both, in, the, form, of, priestesses, and, diviners, both, tacitus, and, eir, ks, saga, rau, a, mention, the, seeress, prophesying, from, a, raised, platform, while, eir, ks, saga, rau, a, also, mentions, the, use, of, a, wand, some, insight, into, germanic, religion, can, be, provided, by, burial, customs, which, varied, widely, in, time, and, space, but, nonetheless, show, a, few, consistent, practices, the, germanic, peoples, generally, practiced, cremation, until, the, first, century, bce, when, limited, inhumation, burials, begin, to, appear, the, ashes, were, usually, placed, in, an, urn, but, the, use, of, pits, mounds, and, cases, when, the, ashes, were, left, on, the, pyre, after, cremation, are, also, known, in, viking, age, scandinavia, as, much, as, half, the, population, may, not, have, received, any, grave, with, their, ashes, scattered, or, their, bodies, unburied, grave, goods, which, might, be, broken, and, placed, in, the, grave, or, burnt, on, the, pyre, with, the, body, included, clothing, jewelry, food, drink, dishes, and, utensils, beginning, in, the, early, 1st, century, ce, a, minority, of, graves, also, included, weapons, on, the, continent, inhumation, burial, becomes, the, most, common, form, of, burial, among, the, southern, germanic, peoples, by, the, end, of, the, migration, period, while, cremation, remains, more, common, in, scandinavia, in, the, migration, period, and, merovingian, period, the, grave, was, often, reopened, and, these, grave, gifts, removed, either, as, grave, robbery, or, as, part, of, an, authorized, removal, by, the, merovingian, period, most, male, burials, include, weapons, often, urns, were, covered, with, stones, and, then, surrounded, by, circles, of, stones, the, urns, of, the, dead, were, often, placed, in, a, mortuary, house, which, may, have, served, as, a, cultic, structure, cemeteries, might, be, placed, around, or, reuse, old, bronze, age, barrows, and, later, placed, near, roman, ruins, and, roads, possibly, to, ease, the, passing, of, the, dead, into, the, afterlife, some, graves, included, burials, of, horses, and, dogs, horses, may, have, been, meant, as, conveyances, to, the, afterlife, burials, with, dogs, are, found, over, a, wide, area, through, the, migration, period, it, is, possible, that, they, were, meant, either, to, protect, the, deceased, in, the, afterlife, or, to, prevent, the, return, of, the, dead, as, a, revenant, after, 1, ce, inhumation, burials, in, large, burial, mounds, with, wooden, or, stone, grave, chambers, which, contained, expensive, grave, goods, and, were, separate, from, the, normal, cemeteries, begin, to, appear, across, the, entire, germanic, area, by, the, 3rd, century, elite, burials, are, attested, from, norway, to, slovakia, with, a, large, number, appearing, on, jutland, these, graves, usually, include, dishes, and, tableware, this, may, have, been, meant, for, the, deceased, to, use, in, the, afterlife, or, may, have, been, used, in, a, funerary, meal, in, the, 400s, ce, the, practice, of, erecting, elite, reihengr, ber, row, graves, appears, among, the, continental, germanic, peoples, these, grave, were, arranged, in, rows, and, contain, large, amounts, of, gold, jewelry, ornaments, and, other, luxury, items, unlike, cremation, cemeteries, only, a, few, hundred, individuals, are, found, buried, in, reihengr, ber, cemeteries, elite, chamber, graves, become, especially, common, in, scandinavia, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, in, which, the, body, of, deceased, was, sometimes, buried, seated, with, objects, in, the, hands, or, on, the, lap, stones, set, up, in, the, shape, of, a, ship, are, known, from, scandinavia, where, they, are, sometimes, surrounded, by, graves, or, occasionally, contain, one, or, more, cremations, the, earliest, ship, burial, is, found, in, jutland, from, the, late, roman, imperial, period, another, earlier, burial, is, from, outside, scandinavia, near, wremen, on, the, weser, river, in, northern, germany, from, the, 4th, or, 5th, century, ce, ship, burials, are, attested, in, england, from, around, 600, ce, and, from, across, scandinavia, and, areas, where, scandinavians, traveled, beginning, around, the, same, time, and, for, centuries, afterward, in, some, cases, the, deceased, was, evidently, cremated, in, the, ship, before, a, mound, was, thrown, up, over, it, as, is, described, by, ahmad, ibn, fadlan, for, the, rus, scholars, debate, the, meaning, of, these, burials, the, ship, may, have, been, a, means, of, transport, to, the, next, life, or, may, have, represented, a, feasting, hall, parts, of, the, ships, were, often, left, uncovered, for, extended, periods, of, time, various, practices, for, divining, the, future, are, attested, for, germanic, paganism, some, of, which, were, likely, only, practiced, in, a, particular, time, or, place, the, main, sources, on, germanic, divination, are, tacitus, christian, early, medieval, texts, of, the, missionary, period, such, as, penitentials, and, frankish, capitularies, and, various, texts, describing, scandinavian, practices, however, the, value, of, all, of, these, sources, for, genuine, germanic, practices, is, debated, the, casting, and, drawing, of, lots, to, determine, the, future, is, well, attested, among, the, germanic, peoples, in, medieval, and, ancient, texts, linguistic, analysis, confirms, that, it, was, an, old, practice, as, of, 2002, about, 160, lots, made, of, various, materials, have, been, found, in, roman, era, and, migration, period, archaeological, sites, the, most, detailed, description, of, germanic, lots, is, found, in, tacitus, germania, chapter, 10, according, to, tacitus, the, germani, cast, lots, made, from, the, wood, of, fruit, bearing, trees, and, marked, with, signs, onto, a, white, sheet, after, which, three, lots, were, drawn, by, either, the, head, of, the, family, or, a, priest, while, the, signs, tacitus, mentions, have, been, interpreted, as, runes, most, scholars, believe, they, were, simple, symbols, thirteenth, century, icelandic, sources, also, attest, the, drawing, of, lots, carved, with, signs, however, there, is, debate, about, whether, these, late, sources, represent, a, form, of, ordeal, that, was, introduced, with, christianity, or, a, continuation, of, germanic, practice, another, important, form, of, divination, involved, animals, the, interpretation, of, the, actions, of, birds, is, a, common, practice, across, the, world, and, is, well, attested, for, the, germani, and, the, norse, more, uniquely, tacitus, says, the, germani, used, the, whinnying, of, horses, to, divine, the, future, although, there, is, no, later, or, corroborating, evidence, for, tacitus, s, horse, divination, the, importance, of, horses, in, germanic, religion, is, well, attested, both, forms, of, divination, might, be, connected, to, the, portrayal, of, birds, and, horses, on, gold, bracteates, a, few, other, methods, of, divination, are, also, attested, tacitus, mentions, duels, as, a, method, of, learning, the, future, while, norse, sources, attest, many, duels, none, are, obviously, used, for, divination, roman, and, christian, sources, sometimes, claimed, that, the, germanic, peoples, used, the, blood, or, entrails, of, human, sacrifices, to, divine, the, future, this, may, derive, from, ancient, topoi, rather, than, reality, although, blood, played, an, important, role, in, pagan, ritual, norse, sources, include, additional, forms, of, divination, such, as, a, form, of, necromancy, known, as, tiseta, as, well, as, sei, r, rituals, the, evidence, suggests, that, the, germanic, peoples, had, recurrent, sacrifices, and, festivals, at, certain, times, of, year, often, these, feasts, involved, sacrifice, at, communal, meals, ritual, drinking, as, well, as, processions, and, divination, almost, all, information, on, germanic, religious, festivals, concerns, western, scandinavia, but, tacitus, mentions, a, sacrifice, to, the, goddess, tamfana, took, place, in, the, autumn, while, bede, mentions, a, festival, called, m, draniht, that, occurred, in, early, february, and, jonas, of, bobbio, s, life, of, saint, columbanus, 640s, mentions, a, festival, to, vodan, odin, held, by, the, suebi, that, involved, the, drinking, of, beer, on, the, basis, of, several, informants, and, possibly, textual, sources, adam, of, bremen, describes, a, swedish, sacrificial, festival, held, every, nine, years, at, the, temple, of, uppsala, while, thietmar, of, merseburg, mentions, a, similar, festival, taking, place, each, january, at, lejre, in, zealand, the, swedish, feast, known, as, disting, took, place, in, february, the, same, time, as, the, old, english, modraniht, the, only, other, widely, attested, festival, is, yule, around, christmas, snorri, sturluson, mentions, three, additional, festivals, in, ynglinga, saga, a, festival, at, the, beginning, of, winter, for, a, good, harvest, one, at, midwinter, for, fertility, and, one, at, the, beginning, of, summer, for, victory, the, summer, festival, is, not, attested, elsewhere, but, rudolf, simek, argues, that, the, winter, festival, was, probably, in, honor, of, the, ancestors, while, another, festival, at, spring, was, for, fertility, magic, is, an, element, of, religion, that, intends, to, influence, the, world, with, the, help, of, the, otherworldly, by, using, particular, rituals, means, or, words, sources, on, pre, christian, magic, among, the, germanic, peoples, are, either, textual, descriptions, or, archaeological, finds, of, objects, the, germanic, languages, lack, a, common, word, that, can, be, translated, as, magic, and, there, is, no, indication, that, the, germanic, peoples, distinguished, between, white, and, black, magic, in, norse, texts, the, god, odin, is, especially, associated, with, magic, a, connection, also, found, for, instance, in, the, old, high, german, second, merseburg, charm, although, runes, are, often, associated, with, magic, most, scholars, no, longer, believe, that, runes, were, in, and, of, themselves, regarded, as, magical, migration, age, inscriptions, on, bracteates, and, later, rune, stones, contain, a, number, of, early, magical, words, and, formulas, the, best, attested, of, which, alu, is, found, on, multiple, objects, from, 200, to, 700, ce, post, conversion, christian, sources, from, continental, europe, mention, forms, of, magic, including, amulets, charms, witchcraft, divination, and, especially, weather, magic, old, norse, mythology, and, post, conversion, literature, also, attest, various, forms, of, magic, including, divination, magic, affecting, nature, weather, or, otherwise, spells, to, make, warriors, impervious, to, weapons, spells, to, strengthen, weapons, and, spells, to, harm, and, distress, others, the, term, charm, is, used, to, mean, magical, poetry, which, could, be, blessings, or, curses, most, attested, charms, are, blessings, and, seek, protection, defense, against, magic, or, sickness, and, healing, the, only, form, of, curses, attested, outside, of, literature, are, calls, for, death, in, old, norse, a, specific, meter, of, alliterative, verse, was, used, galdralag, and, some, pre, christian, charms, have, survived, inscribed, on, metal, or, bone, otherwise, few, charms, are, attested, in, old, norse, outside, of, literature, later, post, conversion, icelandic, charms, sometimes, mention, odin, or, thor, but, they, may, reflect, christian, conceptions, of, magic, numerous, charms, are, attested, in, old, high, german, but, only, the, merseburg, charms, exist, in, a, non, christianized, form, a, similar, situation, exists, in, old, english, where, over, 100, charms, are, attested, including, the, nine, herbs, charm, which, mentions, wodan, odin, ritual, processions, of, the, idol, of, a, god, in, some, form, of, vehicle, usually, a, wagon, are, attested, in, many, religions, of, europe, and, asia, various, archaeological, finds, indicate, the, existence, of, such, rituals, in, scandinavia, as, early, as, the, bronze, age, ships, may, also, have, been, used, for, processions, such, as, the, ship, found, at, oberdorla, moor, in, thuringia, from, the, migration, period, the, processions, are, usually, interpreted, as, fertility, rites, an, image, of, a, viking, age, process, of, some, sort, including, men, women, and, carriages, is, provided, by, the, oseberg, tapestry, fragments, the, earliest, written, source, for, a, ritual, procession, in, germanic, religion, is, in, tacitus, s, germania, chapter, 40, when, he, describes, the, worship, of, nerthus, according, to, tacitus, nerthus, s, idol, is, drawn, around, the, land, for, several, days, on, a, cart, pulled, by, cows, before, being, brought, to, a, lake, and, cleaned, by, slaves, who, are, then, drowned, in, the, lake, tacitus, s, description, is, reminiscent, of, archaeological, finds, of, highly, decorated, wagons, in, water, and, in, burials, from, southern, scandinavia, roughly, contemporary, to, tacitus, a, similar, ritual, is, attested, for, the, goths, who, forced, christians, to, participate, during, the, gothic, persecution, of, christians, 369, 372, ce, as, well, as, among, the, franks, by, gregory, of, tours, although, the, latter, sets, his, ritual, in, pre, germanic, gaul, for, an, eastern, goddess, the, frankish, merovingian, kings, are, also, attested, as, having, been, carried, by, an, oxcart, to, assemblies, something, reminiscent, of, tacitus, s, description, an, extensive, description, of, a, ritual, procession, for, the, god, freyr, is, found, in, the, flateyjarb, k, 1394, it, describes, freyr, being, driven, around, in, a, wagon, to, ensure, a, good, harvest, this, and, several, other, post, conversion, scandinavian, sources, on, such, processions, may, derive, from, oral, tradition, of, the, worship, of, freyr, archaeology, provides, evidence, of, sacrificial, offerings, of, various, types, deposits, of, valuable, objects, including, of, gold, and, silver, that, were, buried, in, the, earth, are, frequently, attested, for, the, period, of, 1, 100, ce, while, these, objects, may, have, been, buried, with, the, intention, of, their, being, removed, again, at, a, later, date, it, is, also, possible, that, they, were, intended, as, sacrifices, for, the, gods, or, for, use, in, the, afterlife, metal, objects, deposited, in, springs, are, attested, from, bad, pyrmont, and, duchcov, as, well, as, such, objects, deposited, in, bogs, there, are, also, examples, of, hair, clothing, and, textiles, from, c, 500, bce, 200, ce, found, in, scandinavian, wetlands, gregory, of, tours, when, describing, a, frankish, shrine, near, cologne, depicts, worshipers, leaving, wooden, carvings, of, parts, of, the, human, body, whenever, they, felt, pain, animal, sacrifices, are, attested, by, bones, in, various, holy, places, associated, with, the, przeworsk, culture, as, well, as, in, denmark, with, animals, sacrificed, included, cattle, horses, pigs, and, sheep, or, goats, there, is, also, evidence, for, human, sacrifice, in, scandinavia, animal, bones, are, often, found, in, bogs, and, lakes, where, a, higher, proportion, of, horse, bones, and, young, animal, bones, are, found, than, at, settlements, a, detailed, description, of, norse, animal, sacrifice, at, lade, is, provided, by, snorri, sturluson, in, h, konar, saga, g, a, although, its, accuracy, is, questionable, evidence, of, the, sacrifice, of, objects, humans, and, animals, is, also, found, in, settlements,
