of, the, water, by, stirring, up, the, muddy, bottom, of, the, spring, so, the, three, of, them, could, not, drink, it, leto, in, her, anger, that, the, impious, lycians, had, refused, to, offer, hospitality, to, a, fatigued, mother, and, her, thirsty, infants, transformed, them, all, into, frogs, forever, doomed, to, swim, and, hop, around, the, spring, the, river, god, alpheus, was, in,

the, panpipes, artemis, taught, a, man, scamandrius, how, to, be, a, great, archer, and, he, excelled, in, the, use, of, a, bow, and, arrow, with, her, guidance, broteas, was, a, famous, hunter, who, refused, to, honour, artemis, and, boasted, that, nothing, could, harm, him, not, even, fire, artemis, then, drove, him, mad, causing, him, to, walk, into, fire, ending, his, life, according, to, antoninus, liberalis, siproites, was, a, cretan, who, was, metamorphized, into, a, woman, by, artemis, for, while, hunting, seeing, the, goddess, bathing, artemis, also, changed, a, calydonian, man, named, calydon, the, son, of, ares, and, astynome, into, stone, when, he, saw, the, goddess, bathing, naked, multiple, versions, of, the, actaeon, myth, survive, though, many, are, fragmentary, the, details, vary, but, at, the, core, they, involve, the, great, hunter, actaeon, whom, artemis, turns, into, a, stag, for, a, transgression, and, who, is, then, killed, by, hunting, dogs, usually, the, dogs, are, his, own, but, no, longer, recognize, their, master, occasionally, they, are, said, to, be, the, hounds, of, artemis, various, tellings, diverge, in, terms, of, the, hunter, s, transgression, sometimes, merely, seeing, the, virgin, goddess, naked, sometimes, boasting, he, is, a, better, hunter, than, she, or, even, merely, being, a, rival, of, zeus, for, the, affections, of, semele, apollodorus, who, records, the, semele, version, notes, that, the, ones, with, artemis, are, more, common, according, to, lamar, ronald, lacey, s, the, myth, of, aktaion, literary, and, iconographic, studies, the, standard, modern, text, on, the, work, the, most, likely, original, version, of, the, myth, portrays, actaeon, as, the, hunting, companion, of, the, goddess, who, seeing, her, naked, in, her, sacred, spring, attempts, to, force, himself, on, her, for, this, hubris, he, is, turned, into, a, stag, and, devoured, by, his, own, hounds, however, in, some, surviving, versions, actaeon, is, a, stranger, who, happens, upon, artemis, a, single, line, from, aeschylus, s, now, lost, play, toxotides, female, archers, is, among, the, earlier, attestations, of, actaeon, s, myth, stating, that, the, dogs, destroyed, their, master, utterly, with, no, confirmation, of, actaeon, s, metamorphosis, or, the, god, he, offended, but, it, is, heavily, implied, to, be, artemis, due, to, the, title, ancient, artwork, depicting, the, myth, of, actaeon, predate, aeschylus, euripides, coming, in, a, bit, later, wrote, in, the, bacchae, that, actaeon, was, torn, to, shreds, and, perhaps, devoured, by, his, flesh, eating, hunting, dogs, when, he, claimed, to, be, a, better, hunter, than, artemis, like, aeschylus, he, does, not, mention, actaeon, being, deer, shaped, when, that, happens, callimachus, writes, that, actaeon, chanced, upon, artemis, bathing, in, the, woods, and, she, caused, him, to, be, devoured, by, his, own, hounds, for, the, sacrilege, and, he, makes, no, mention, of, transformation, into, a, deer, either, diodorus, siculus, wrote, that, actaeon, dedicated, his, prizes, in, hunting, to, artemis, proposed, marriage, to, her, and, even, tried, to, forcefully, consummate, said, marriage, inside, the, very, sacred, temple, of, the, goddess, for, this, he, was, given, the, form, of, one, of, the, animals, which, he, was, wont, to, hunt, and, then, torn, to, shreds, by, his, hunting, dogs, diodorus, also, mentioned, the, alternative, of, actaeon, claiming, to, be, a, better, hunter, than, the, goddess, of, the, hunt, hyginus, also, mentions, actaeon, attempting, to, rape, artemis, when, he, finds, her, bathing, naked, and, her, transforming, him, into, the, doomed, deer, apollodorus, wrote, that, when, actaeon, saw, artemis, bathing, she, turned, him, into, a, deer, on, the, spot, and, intentionally, drove, his, dogs, into, a, frenzy, so, that, they, would, kill, and, devour, him, afterward, chiron, built, a, sculpture, of, actaeon, to, comfort, his, dogs, in, their, grief, as, they, could, not, find, their, master, no, matter, how, much, they, looked, for, him, according, to, the, latin, version, of, the, story, told, by, the, roman, ovid, actaeon, was, a, hunter, who, after, returning, home, from, a, long, day, s, hunting, in, the, woods, he, stumbled, upon, artemis, and, her, retinue, of, nymphs, bathing, in, her, sacred, grotto, the, nymphs, panicking, rushed, to, cover, artemis, naked, body, with, their, own, as, artemis, splashed, some, water, on, actaeon, saying, he, was, welcome, to, share, with, everyone, the, tale, of, seeing, her, without, any, clothes, as, long, as, he, could, share, it, at, all, immediately, he, was, transformed, into, a, deer, and, in, panic, ran, away, but, he, did, not, go, far, as, he, was, hunted, down, and, eventually, caught, and, devoured, by, his, own, fifty, hunting, dogs, who, could, not, recognize, their, own, master, pausanias, says, that, actaeon, saw, artemis, naked, and, that, she, threw, a, deerskin, on, him, so, that, his, hounds, would, kill, him, in, order, to, prevent, him, from, marrying, semele, the, story, of, niobe, queen, of, thebes, and, wife, of, amphion, who, blasphemously, boasted, of, being, superior, to, leto, this, myth, is, very, old, homer, knew, of, it, and, wrote, that, niobe, had, given, birth, to, twelve, children, equally, divided, in, six, sons, and, six, daughters, the, niobids, other, sources, speak, of, fourteen, children, seven, sons, and, seven, daughters, niobe, claimed, of, being, a, better, mother, than, leto, for, having, more, children, than, leto, s, own, two, but, the, two, though, they, were, only, two, destroyed, all, those, others, leto, was, not, slow, to, catch, up, on, that, and, grew, angry, at, the, queen, s, hubris, she, summoned, her, children, and, commanded, them, to, avenge, the, slight, against, her, swiftly, apollo, and, artemis, descended, on, thebes, while, the, sons, were, hunting, in, the, woods, apollo, crept, up, on, them, and, slew, all, seven, with, his, silver, bow, the, dead, bodies, were, brought, to, the, palace, niobe, wept, for, them, but, did, not, relent, saying, that, even, now, she, was, better, than, leto, for, she, still, had, seven, children, her, daughters, on, cue, artemis, then, started, shooting, the, daughters, one, by, one, right, as, niobe, begged, for, her, youngest, one, to, be, spared, artemis, killed, that, last, one, niobe, cried, bitter, tears, and, was, turned, into, a, rock, amphion, at, the, sight, of, his, dead, sons, killed, himself, the, gods, themselves, entombed, them, in, some, versions, apollo, and, artemis, spared, a, single, son, and, daughter, each, for, they, prayed, to, leto, for, help, thus, niobe, had, as, many, children, as, leto, did, but, no, more, orion, was, artemis, hunting, companion, after, giving, up, on, trying, to, find, oenopion, orion, met, artemis, and, her, mother, leto, and, joined, the, goddess, in, hunting, a, great, hunter, himself, he, bragged, that, he, would, kill, every, beast, on, earth, gaia, the, earth, was, not, too, pleased, to, hear, that, and, sent, a, giant, scorpion, to, sting, him, artemis, then, transferred, him, into, the, stars, as, the, constellation, orion, in, one, version, orion, died, after, pushing, leto, out, of, the, scorpion, s, way, in, another, version, orion, tries, to, violate, opis, one, of, artemis, followers, from, hyperborea, and, artemis, kills, him, in, a, version, by, aratus, orion, grabs, artemis, robe, and, she, kills, him, in, self, defense, other, writers, have, artemis, kill, him, for, trying, to, rape, her, or, one, of, her, attendants, istrus, wrote, a, version, in, which, artemis, fell, in, love, with, orion, apparently, the, only, time, artemis, ever, fell, in, love, she, meant, to, marry, him, and, no, talk, from, her, brother, apollo, would, change, her, mind, apollo, then, decided, to, trick, artemis, and, while, orion, was, off, swimming, in, the, sea, he, pointed, at, him, barely, a, spot, in, the, horizon, and, wagered, that, artemis, could, not, hit, that, small, dot, artemis, ever, eager, to, prove, she, was, the, better, archer, shot, orion, killing, him, she, then, placed, him, among, the, stars, in, homer, s, iliad, the, goddess, of, the, dawn, eos, seduces, orion, angering, the, gods, who, did, not, approve, of, immortal, goddesses, taking, mortal, men, for, lovers, causing, artemis, to, shoot, and, kill, him, on, the, island, of, ortygia, callisto, the, daughter, of, lycaon, king, of, arcadia, was, one, of, artemis, hunting, attendants, and, as, a, companion, of, artemis, took, a, vow, of, chastity, according, to, hesiod, in, his, lost, poem, astronomia, zeus, appeared, to, callisto, and, seduced, her, resulting, in, her, becoming, pregnant, though, she, was, able, to, hide, her, pregnancy, for, a, time, she, was, soon, found, out, while, bathing, enraged, artemis, transformed, callisto, into, a, bear, and, in, this, form, she, gave, birth, to, her, son, arcas, both, of, them, were, then, captured, by, shepherds, and, given, to, lycaon, and, callisto, thus, lost, her, child, sometime, later, callisto, thought, fit, to, go, into, a, forbidden, sanctuary, of, zeus, and, was, hunted, by, the, arcadians, her, son, among, them, when, she, was, about, to, be, killed, zeus, saved, her, by, placing, her, in, the, heavens, as, a, constellation, of, a, bear, in, his, de, astronomica, hyginus, after, recounting, the, version, from, hesiod, presents, several, other, alternative, versions, the, first, which, he, attributes, to, amphis, says, that, zeus, seduced, callisto, by, disguising, himself, as, artemis, during, a, hunting, session, and, that, when, artemis, found, out, that, callisto, was, pregnant, she, replied, saying, that, it, was, the, goddess, s, fault, causing, artemis, to, transform, her, into, a, bear, this, version, also, has, both, callisto, and, arcas, placed, in, the, heavens, as, the, constellations, ursa, major, and, ursa, minor, hyginus, then, presents, another, version, in, which, after, zeus, lay, with, callisto, it, was, hera, who, transformed, her, into, a, bear, artemis, later, while, hunting, kills, the, bear, and, later, on, being, recognized, callisto, was, placed, among, the, stars, hyginus, also, gives, another, version, in, which, hera, tries, to, catch, zeus, and, callisto, in, the, act, causing, zeus, to, transform, her, into, a, bear, hera, finding, the, bear, points, it, out, to, artemis, who, is, hunting, zeus, in, panic, places, callisto, in, the, heavens, as, a, constellation, ovid, gives, a, somewhat, different, version, zeus, seduced, callisto, once, again, disguised, as, artemis, but, she, seems, to, realise, that, it, is, not, the, real, artemis, and, she, thus, does, not, blame, artemis, when, during, bathing, she, is, found, out, callisto, is, rather, than, being, transformed, simply, ousted, from, the, company, of, the, huntresses, and, she, thus, gives, birth, to, arcas, as, a, human, only, later, is, she, transformed, into, a, bear, this, time, by, hera, when, arcas, fully, grown, is, out, hunting, he, nearly, kills, his, mother, who, is, saved, only, by, zeus, placing, her, in, the, heavens, in, the, bibliotheca, a, version, is, presented, in, which, zeus, raped, callisto, having, assumed, the, likeness, as, some, say, of, artemis, or, as, others, say, of, apollo, he, then, turned, her, into, a, bear, himself, so, as, to, hide, the, event, from, hera, artemis, then, shot, the, bear, either, upon, the, persuasion, of, hera, or, out, of, anger, at, callisto, for, breaking, her, virginity, once, callisto, was, dead, zeus, made, her, into, a, constellation, took, the, child, named, him, arcas, and, gave, him, to, maia, who, raised, him, pausanias, in, his, description, of, greece, presents, another, version, in, which, after, zeus, seduced, callisto, hera, turned, her, into, a, bear, which, artemis, killed, to, please, hera, hermes, was, then, sent, by, zeus, to, take, arcas, and, zeus, himself, placed, callisto, in, the, heavens, when, zeus, gigantic, son, tityos, tried, to, rape, leto, she, called, out, to, her, children, for, help, and, both, artemis, and, apollo, were, quick, to, respond, by, raining, down, their, arrows, on, tityos, killing, him, chione, was, a, princess, of, phokis, she, was, beloved, by, two, gods, hermes, and, apollo, and, boasted, that, she, was, more, beautiful, than, artemis, because, she, had, made, two, gods, fall, in, love, with, her, at, once, artemis, was, furious, and, killed, chione, with, an, arrow, or, struck, her, mute, by, shooting, off, her, tongue, however, some, versions, of, this, myth, say, apollo, and, hermes, protected, her, from, artemis, wrath, artemis, saved, the, infant, atalanta, from, dying, of, exposure, after, her, father, abandoned, her, she, sent, a, female, bear, to, nurse, the, baby, who, was, then, raised, by, hunters, in, some, stories, artemis, later, sent, a, bear, to, injure, atalanta, because, others, claimed, atalanta, was, a, superior, hunter, among, other, adventures, atalanta, participated, in, the, calydonian, boar, hunt, which, artemis, had, sent, to, destroy, calydon, because, king, oeneus, had, forgotten, her, at, the, harvest, sacrifices, in, the, hunt, atalanta, drew, the, first, blood, and, was, awarded, the, prize, of, the, boar, s, hide, she, hung, it, in, a, sacred, grove, at, tegea, as, a, dedication, to, artemis, meleager, was, a, hero, of, aetolia, king, oeneus, ordered, him, to, gather, heroes, from, all, over, greece, to, hunt, the, calydonian, boar, after, the, death, of, meleager, artemis, turns, his, grieving, sisters, the, meleagrids, into, guineafowl, that, artemis, favoured, in, nonnus, dionysiaca, aura, the, daughter, of, lelantos, and, periboia, was, a, companion, of, artemis, when, out, hunting, one, day, with, artemis, she, asserts, that, the, goddess, s, voluptuous, body, and, breasts, are, too, womanly, and, sensual, and, doubts, her, virginity, arguing, that, her, own, lithe, body, and, man, like, breasts, are, better, than, artemis, and, a, true, symbol, of, her, own, chastity, in, anger, artemis, asks, nemesis, for, help, to, avenge, her, dignity, nemesis, agrees, telling, artemis, that, aura, s, punishment, will, be, to, lose, her, virginity, since, she, dared, question, that, of, artemis, nemesis, then, arranges, for, eros, to, make, dionysus, fall, in, love, with, aura, dionysus, intoxicates, aura, and, rapes, her, as, she, lies, unconscious, after, which, she, becomes, a, deranged, killer, while, pregnant, she, tries, to, kill, herself, or, cut, open, her, belly, as, artemis, mocks, her, over, it, when, she, bore, twin, sons, she, ate, one, while, the, other, iacchus, was, saved, by, artemis, the, twin, sons, of, poseidon, and, iphimedeia, otos, and, ephialtes, grew, enormously, at, a, young, age, they, were, aggressive, and, skilled, hunters, who, could, not, be, killed, except, by, each, other, the, growth, of, the, aloadae, never, stopped, and, they, boasted, that, as, soon, as, they, could, reach, heaven, they, would, kidnap, artemis, and, hera, and, take, them, as, wives, the, gods, were, afraid, of, them, except, for, artemis, who, captured, a, fine, deer, that, jumped, out, between, them, in, another, version, of, the, story, she, changed, herself, into, a, doe, and, jumped, between, them, the, aloadae, threw, their, spears, and, so, mistakenly, killed, one, another, in, another, version, apollo, sent, the, deer, into, the, aloadae, s, midst, causing, their, accidental, killing, of, each, other, in, another, version, they, start, pilling, up, mountains, to, reach, mount, olympus, in, order, to, catch, hera, and, artemis, but, the, gods, spot, them, and, attack, when, the, twins, had, retreated, the, gods, learnt, that, ares, had, been, captured, the, aloadae, not, sure, about, what, to, do, with, ares, lock, him, up, in, a, pot, artemis, then, turns, into, a, deer, and, causes, them, to, kill, each, other, in, some, versions, of, the, story, of, adonis, artemis, sent, a, wild, boar, to, kill, him, as, punishment, for, boasting, that, he, was, a, better, hunter, than, her, in, other, versions, artemis, killed, adonis, for, revenge, in, later, myths, adonis, is, a, favorite, of, aphrodite, who, was, responsible, for, the, death, of, hippolytus, who, had, been, a, hunter, of, artemis, therefore, artemis, killed, adonis, to, avenge, hippolytus, s, death, in, yet, another, version, adonis, was, not, killed, by, artemis, but, by, ares, as, punishment, for, being, with, aphrodite, polyphonte, was, a, young, woman, who, fled, home, in, pursuit, of, a, free, virginal, life, with, artemis, as, opposed, to, the, conventional, life, of, marriage, and, children, favoured, by, aphrodite, as, a, punishment, aphrodite, cursed, her, causing, her, to, mate, and, have, children, with, a, bear, artemis, seeing, that, was, disgusted, and, sent, a, horde, of, wild, animals, against, her, causing, polyphonte, to, flee, to, her, father, s, house, her, resulting, offspring, agrius, and, oreius, were, wild, cannibals, who, incurred, the, hatred, of, zeus, ultimately, the, entire, family, was, transformed, into, birds, who, became, ill, portents, for, mankind, coronis, was, a, princess, from, thessaly, who, became, the, lover, of, apollo, and, fell, pregnant, while, apollo, was, away, coronis, began, an, affair, with, a, mortal, man, named, ischys, when, apollo, learnt, of, this, he, sent, artemis, to, kill, the, pregnant, coronis, or, artemis, had, the, initiative, to, kill, coronis, on, her, own, accord, for, the, insult, done, against, her, brother, the, unborn, child, asclepius, was, later, removed, from, his, dead, mother, s, womb, when, two, of, her, hunting, companions, who, had, sworn, to, remain, chaste, and, be, devoted, to, her, rhodopis, and, euthynicus, fell, in, love, with, each, other, and, broke, their, vows, in, a, cavern, artemis, turned, rhodopis, into, a, fountain, inside, that, very, cavern, as, punishment, the, two, had, fallen, in, love, not, on, their, own, but, only, after, eros, had, struck, them, with, his, love, arrows, commanded, by, his, mother, aphrodite, who, had, taken, offence, in, that, rhodopis, and, euthynicus, rejected, love, and, marriage, in, favour, of, a, chaste, life, when, the, monstrous, typhon, attacked, olympus, all, the, terrified, gods, transformed, into, various, animals, and, fled, to, egypt, artemis, became, a, cat, as, she, was, identified, by, the, greeks, with, the, egyptian, feline, goddess, bastet, when, the, queen, of, kos, echemeia, ceased, to, worship, artemis, she, shot, her, with, an, arrow, persephone, then, snatched, the, still, living, euthemia, and, brought, her, to, the, underworld, artemis, may, have, been, represented, as, a, supporter, of, troy, because, her, brother, apollo, was, the, patron, god, of, the, city, and, she, herself, was, widely, worshipped, in, western, anatolia, in, historical, times, artemis, plays, a, significant, role, in, the, war, like, leto, and, apollo, artemis, took, the, side, of, the, trojans, in, iliad, artemis, on, her, chariot, with, the, golden, reins, kills, the,

he, killed, a, sacred, stag, in, a, sacred, grove, and, boasted, that, he, was, a, better, hunter, than, the, goddess, when, the, greek, fleet, was, preparing, at, aulis, to, depart, for, troy, to, commence, the, trojan, war, artemis, becalmed, the, winds, the, seer, calchas, erroneously, advised, agamemnon, that, the, only, way, to, appease, artemis, was, to, sacrifice, his, daughter, iphigenia, in, some, version, of, the, myth, artemis, then, snatched, iphigenia, from, the, altar, and, substituted, a, deer, in, others, artemis, allowed, iphigenia, to, be, sacrificed, in, versions, where, iphigenia, survived, a, number, of, different, myths, have, been, told, about, what, happened, after, artemis, took, her, either, she, was, brought, to, tauris, and, led, the, priests, there, or, she, became, artemis, immortal, companion, aeneas, was, also, helped, by, artemis, leto, and, apollo, apollo, found, him, wounded, by, diomedes, and, lifted, him, to, heaven, there, the, three, deities, secretly, healed, him, in, a, great, chamber, during, the, theomachy, artemis, found, herself, standing, opposite, of, hera, on, which, a, scholium, to, the, iliad, wrote, that, they, represent, the, moon, versus, the, air, around, the, earth, artemis, chided, her, brother, apollo, for, not, fighting, poseidon, and, told, him, never, to, brag, again, apollo, did, not, answer, her, an, angry, hera, berated, artemis, for, daring, to, fight, her, how, now, art, thou, fain, thou, bold, and, shameless, thing, to, stand, forth, against, me, no, easy, foe, i, tell, thee, am, i, that, thou, shouldst, vie, with, me, in, might, albeit, thou, bearest, the, bow, since, it, was, against, women, that, zeus, made, thee, a, lion, and, granted, thee, to, slay, whomsoever, of, them, thou, wilt, in, good, sooth, it, is, better, on, the, mountains, to, be, slaying, beasts, and, wild, deer, than, to, fight, amain, with, those, mightier, than, thou, howbeit, if, thou, wilt, learn, thou, of, war, that, thou, mayest, know, full, well, how, much, mightier, am, i, seeing, thou, matchest, thy, strength, with, mine, hera, then, grabbed, artemis, hands, by, the, wrists, and, holding, her, in, place, beat, her, with, her, own, bow, crying, artemis, left, her, bow, and, arrows, where, they, lay, and, ran, to, olympus, to, cry, at, her, father, zeus, knees, while, her, mother, leto,

one, of, the, primary, goddesses, of, childbirth, and, midwifery, along, with, eileithyia, dedications, of, clothing, to, her, sanctuaries, after, a, successful, birth, was, common, in, the, classical, era, artemis, could, be, a, deity, to, be, feared, by, pregnant, women, as, deaths, during, this, time, were, attributed, to, her, as, childbirth, and, pregnancy, was, a, very, common, and, important, event, there, were, numerous, other, deities, associated, with, it, many, localized, to, a, particular, geographic, area, including, but, not, limited, to, aphrodite, hera, and, hekate, it, was, considered, a, good, sign, when, artemis, appeared, in, the, dreams, of, hunters, and, pregnant, women, but, a, naked, artemis, was, seen, as, an, ill, omen, according, to, pseudo, apollodorus, she, assisted, her, mother, in, the, delivery, of, her, twin, older, sources, such, as, homeric, hymn, to, delian, apollo, in, line, 115, have, the, arrival, of, eileithyia, on, delos, as, the, event, that, allows, leto, to, give, birth, to, her, children, contradictory, is, hesiod, s, presentation, of, the, myth, in, theogony, where, he, states, that, leto, bore, her, children, before, zeus, marriage, to, hera, with, no, commentary, on, any, drama, related, to, their, birth, despite, her, being, primarily, known, as, a, goddess, of, hunting, and, the, wilderness, she, was, also, connected, to, dancing, music, and, song, like, her, brother, apollo, she, is, often, seen, singing, and, dancing, with, her, nymphs, or, leading, the, chorus, of, the, muses, and, the, graces, at, delphi, in, sparta, girls, of, marriageable, age, performed, the, partheneia, choral, maiden, songs, in, her, honor, an, ancient, greek, proverb, written, down, by, aesop, went, for, where, did, artemis, not, dance, signifying, the, goddess, connection, to, dancing, and, festivity, during, the, classical, period, in, athens, she, was, identified, with, hekate, artemis, also, assimilated, caryatis, carya, there, was, a, women, s, cult, at, cyzicus, worshiping, artemis, which, was, called, dolon, artemis, was, born, on, the, sixth, day, of, the, month, thargelion, around, may, which, made, it, sacred, for, her, as, her, birthday, on, the, seventh, day, of, the, same, month, was, apollo, s, birthday, artemis, was, worshipped, in, many, festivals, throughout, greece, mainland, and, the, islands, asia, minor, and, south, italy, most, of, these, festivals, were, celebrated, during, spring, distinguished, by, a, peculiar, dance, and, by, a, music, on, the, flute, chitonia, wearing, a, loose, tunic, was, a, goddess, of, hunting, an, important, aspect, of, artemis, persona, and, worship, was, her, virginity, which, may, seem, contradictory, given, her, role, as, a, goddess, associated, with, childbirth, the, idea, of, artemis, as, a, virgin, goddess, likely, is, related, to, her, primary, role, as, a, huntress, hunters, traditionally, abstained, from, sex, prior, to, the, hunt, as, a, form, of, ritual, purity, and, out, of, a, belief, that, the, scent, would, scare, off, potential, prey, the, ancient, cultural, context, in, which, artemis, worship, emerged, also, held, that, virginity, was, a, prerequisite, to, marriage, and, that, a, married, woman, became, subservient, to, her, husband, in, this, light, artemis, virginity, is, also, related, to, her, power, and, independence, rather, than, a, form, of, asexuality, it, is, an, attribute, that, signals, artemis, as, her, own, master, with, power, equal, to, that, of, male, gods, her, virginity, also, possibly, represents, a, concentration, of, fertility, that, can, be, spread, among, her, followers, in, the, manner, of, earlier, mother, goddess, figures, however, some, later, greek, writers, did, come, to, treat, artemis, as, inherently, asexual, and, as, an, opposite, to, aphrodite, furthermore, some, have, described, artemis, along, with, the, goddesses, hestia, and, athena, as, being, asexual, this, is, mainly, supported, by, the, fact, that, in, the, homeric, hymns, 5, to, aphrodite, aphrodite, is, described, as, having, no, power, over, the, three, goddesses, despite, her, virginity, both, modern, scholars, and, ancient, commentaries, have, linked, artemis, to, the, archetype, of, the, mother, goddess, artemis, was, traditionally, linked, to, fertility, and, was, petitioned, to, assist, women, with, childbirth, according, to, herodotus, greek, playwright, aeschylus, identified, artemis, with, persephone, as, a, daughter, of, demeter, her, worshipers, in, arcadia, also, traditionally, associated, her, with, demeter, and, persephone, in, asia, minor, she, was, often, conflated, with, local, mother, goddess, figures, such, as, cybele, and, anahita, in, iran, the, archetype, of, the, mother, goddess, though, was, not, highly, compatible, with, the, greek, pantheon, and, though, the, greeks, had, adopted, the, worship, of, cybele, and, other, anatolian, mother, goddesses, as, early, as, the, seventh, century, bce, she, was, not, directly, conflated, with, any, greek, goddesses, instead, bits, and, pieces, of, her, worship, and, aspects, were, absorbed, variously, by, artemis, aphrodite, and, others, as, eastern, influence, spread, at, ephesus, in, ionia, turkey, her, temple, became, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, world, it, was, probably, the, best, known, center, of, her, worship, except, for, delos, there, the, lady, whom, the, ionians, associated, with, artemis, through, interpretatio, graeca, was, worshipped, primarily, as, a, mother, goddess, akin, to, the, phrygian, goddess, cybele, in, an, ancient, sanctuary, where, her, cult, image, depicted, the, lady, of, ephesus, adorned, with, multiple, large, beads, excavation, at, the, site, of, the, artemision, in, 1987, 88, identified, a, multitude, of, tear, shaped, amber, beads, that, had, been, hung, on, the, original, wooden, statue, xoanon, and, these, were, probably, carried, over, into, later, sculpted, copies, in, acts, of, the, apostles, ephesian, metalsmiths, who, felt, threatened, by, saint, paul, s, preaching, of, christianity, jealously, rioted, in, her, defense, shouting, great, is, artemis, of, the, ephesians, of, the, 121, columns, of, her, temple, only, one, composite, made, up, of, fragments, still, stands, as, a, marker, of, the, temple, s, location, no, records, have, been, found, of, the, greeks, referring, to, artemis, as, a, lunar, deity, as, their, lunar, deity, was, selene, but, the, romans, identified, artemis, with, selene, leading, them, to, perceive, her, as, a, lunar, deity, though, the, greeks, did, not, refer, to, her, or, worship, her, as, such, as, the, romans, began, to, associate, apollo, more, with, helios, the, personification, of, the, sun, it, was, only, natural, that, the, romans, would, then, begin, to, identify, apollo, s, twin, sister, artemis, with, helios, own, sister, selene, the, personification, of, the, moon, evidence, of, the, syncretism, of, artemis, and, selene, is, found, early, on, a, scholium, on, the, iliad, claiming, to, be, reporting, sixth, century, bce, author, theagenes, s, interpretation, of, the, theomachy, in, book, 21, says, that, in, the, fight, between, artemis, and, hera, artemis, represents, the, moon, while, hera, represents, the, earthly, air, active, references, to, artemis, as, an, illuminating, goddess, start, much, later, notably, roman, era, author, plutarch, writes, how, during, the, battle, of, salamis, artemis, led, the, athenians, to, victory, by, shining, with, the, full, moon, but, all, lunar, related, narratives, of, this, event, come, from, roman, times, and, none, of, the, contemporary, writers, such, as, herodotus, makes, any, mention, of, the, night, or, the, moon, artemis, connection, to, childbed, and, women, s, labour, naturally, led, to, her, becoming, associated, with, the, menstrual, cycle, in, course, of, time, thus, the, moon, selene, just, like, artemis, was, linked, to, childbirth, as, it, was, believed, that, women, had, the, easiest, labours, during, the, full, moon, paving, thus, the, way, for, the, two, goddesses, to, be, seen, as, the, same, on, that, cicero, writes, apollo, a, greek, name, is, called, sol, the, sun, and, diana, luna, the, moon, luna, the, moon, is, so, called, a, lucendo, from, shining, she, bears, the, name, also, of, lucina, and, as, in, greece, the, women, in, labor, invoke, diana, lucifera, association, to, health, was, another, reason, artemis, and, selene, were, syncretized, strabo, wrote, that, apollo, and, artemis, were, connected, to, the, sun, and, the, moon, respectively, which, was, due, to, the, changes, the, two, celestial, bodies, caused, in, the, temperature, of, the, air, as, the, twins, were, gods, of, pestilential, diseases, and, sudden, deaths, roman, authors, applied, artemis, diana, s, byname, phoebe, to, luna, selene, the, same, way, as, phoebus, was, given, to, helios, due, to, his, identification, with, apollo, another, epithet, of, artemis, that, selene, appropriated, is, cynthia, meaning, born, in, mount, cynthus, the, goddesses, artemis, selene, and, hecate, formed, a, triad, identified, as, the, same, goddess, with, three, avatars, selene, in, the, sky, moon, artemis, on, earth, hunting, and, hecate, beneath, the, earth, underworld, in, italy, those, three, goddesses, became, a, ubiquitous, feature, in, depictions, of, sacred, groves, where, hecate, trivia, marked, intersections, and, crossroads, along, with, other, liminal, deities, the, romans, enthusiastically, celebrated, the, multiple, identities, of, diana, as, hecate, luna, and, trivia, roman, poet, horace, in, his, odes, enjoins, apollo, to, listen, to, the, prayers, of, the, boys, as, he, asks, luna, the, two, horned, queen, of, the, stars, to, listen, to, those, of, the, girls, in, place, of, diana, due, to, their, role, as, protectors, of, the, young, in, virgil, s, aeneid, when, nisus, addresses, luna, the, moon, he, calls, her, daughter, of, latona, in, works, of, art, the, two, goddesses, were, mostly, distinguished, selene, is, usually, depicted, as, being, shorter, than, artemis, with, a, rounder, face, and, wearing, a, long, robe, instead, of, a, short, hunting, chiton, with, a, billowing, cloak, forming, an, arc, above, her, head, artemis, was, sometimes, depicted, with, a, lunate, crown, hecate, was, the, goddess, of, crossroads, boundaries, ghosts, and, witchcraft, she, is, the, queen, of, the, witches, artemis, absorbed, the, pre, greek, goddess, potnia, theron, who, was, closely, associated, with, the, daimons, in, the, mycenean, age, daimons, were, lesser, deities, of, ghosts, divine, spirits, and, tutelary, deities, some, scholars, believe, that, hecate, was, an, aspect, of, artemis, prior, to, the, latter, s, adoption, into, the, olympian, pantheon, artemis, would, have, at, that, point, become, more, strongly, associated, with, purity, and, maidenhood, on, the, one, hand, while, her, originally, darker, attributes, like, her, association, with, magic, the, souls, of, the, dead, and, the, night, would, have, continued, to, be, worshipped, separately, under, her, title, hecate, both, goddesses, carried, torches, and, were, accompanied, by, a, dog, it, seems, that, the, character, of, artemis, in, arcadia, was, original, at, acacesium, artemis, hegemone, is, depicted, holding, two, torches, and, at, lycosura, artemis, is, depicted, holding, a, snake, and, a, torch, a, bitch, suitable, for, hunting, was, lying, down, by, her, side, sophocles, calles, artemis, amphipyros, carrying, a, torch, in, each, hand, however, the, adjective, refers, also, to, the, twin, fire, on, the, two, peaks, of, the, mountain, parnassus, behind, delphi, in, the, fest, of, laphria, at, delphi, artemis, is, related, to, the, pre, greek, mistress, of, the, animals, with, barbaric, sacrifices, and, possible, connections, with, magic, and, ghosts, since, potnia, theron, was, close, to, the, daimons, the, annual, fire, was, the, characteristique, custom, of, the, fest, at, kerameikos, in, athens, artemis, is, clearly, identified, with, hecate, pausanias, believes, that, kalliste, the, most, beautiful, is, a, surname, of, artemis, carrying, a, torch, in, thessaly, the, distinctly, local, goddess, enodia, with, the, surname, pheraia, is, identified, with, hecate, artemis, pheraia, was, worshipped, in, argos, athens, and, sicyon, homer, uses, the, epithet, chrisinios, of, the, golden, reigns, to, illustrate, the, chariot, of, the, goddess, of, hunting, at, the, fest, of, laphria, at, delphi, the, priestess, followed, the, parade, on, a, chariot, which, was,

artemis, is, also, sometimes, depicted, with, a, fishing, spear, connected, with, her, cult, as, a, patron, goddess, of, fishing, this, conception, relates, her, with, diktynna, britomartis, as, a, goddess, of, maiden, dances, and, songs, artemis, is, often, portrayed, with, a, lyre, in, ancient, art, deer, were, the, only, animals, held, sacred, to, artemis, herself, on, seeing, a, deer, larger, than, a, bull, with, horns, shining, she, fell, in, love, with, these, creatures, and, held, them, sacred, deer, were, also, the, first, animals, she, captured, she, caught, five, golden,

and, persephone, it, seems, that, the, depictions, of, artemis, and, demeter, melaina, black, in, arcadia, correspond, to, the, earliest, conceptions, of, the, first, greeks, in, greece, at, the, fest, of, laphria, at, delphi, the, priestess, followed, the, parade, on, a, chariot, which, was, covered, with, the, skin, of, a, deer, the, third, labour, of, heracles, commanded, by, eurystheus,
