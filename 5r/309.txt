the, traditional, maya, or, mayan, religion, of, the, extant, maya, peoples, of, guatemala, belize, western, honduras, and, the, tabasco, chiapas, quintana, roo, campeche, and, yucat, n, states, of, mexico, is, part, of, the, wider, frame, of, mesoamerican, religion, as, is, the, case, with, many, other, contemporary, mesoamerican, religions, it, results, from, centuries, of, symbiosis, with, roman, catholicism, when, its, pre, hispanic, antecedents, are, taken, into, account, however, traditional, maya, religion, has, already, existed, for, more, than, two, and, a, half, millennia, as, a, recognizably, distinct, phenomenon, before, the, advent, of, christianity, it, was, spread, over, many, indigenous, kingdoms, all, with, their, own, local, traditions, today, it, coexists, and, interacts, with, pan, mayan, syncretism, the, re, invention, of, tradition, by, the, pan, maya, movement, and, christianity, in, its, various, denominations, the, most, important, source, on, traditional, maya, religion, is, the, mayas, themselves, the, incumbents, of, positions, within, the, religious, hierarchy, diviners, and, tellers, of, tales, more, generally, all, those, persons, who, shared, their, knowledge, with, outsiders, in, the, past, as, well, as, anthropologists, and, historians, who, studied, them, and, continue, to, do, so, what, is, known, of, pre, hispanic, maya, religion, stems, from, heterogeneous, sources, the, primary, ones, being, of, maya, origin, traditional, maya, religion, though, also, representing, a, belief, system, is, often, referred, to, as, costumbre, the, custom, or, habitual, religious, practice, in, contradistinction, to, orthodox, roman, catholic, ritual, to, a, large, extent, maya, religion, is, indeed, a, complex, of, ritual, practices, and, it, is, therefore, fitting, that, the, indigenous, yucatec, village, priest, is, simply, called, jmen, practitioner, among, the, main, concepts, relating, to, maya, ritual, are, the, following, ones, the, maya, landscape, is, a, ritual, topography, with, landmarks, such, as, mountains, wells, and, caves, being, assigned, to, specific, ancestors, and, deities, see, also, maya, cave, sites, thus, the, tzotzil, town, of, zinacantan, is, surrounded, by, seven, bathing, places, of, mountain, dwelling, ancestors, with, one, of, these, sacred, waterholes, serving, as, the, residence, of, the, ancestors, nursemaids, and, laundresses, as, in, the, pre, hispanic, past, an, important, part, of, ritual, behavior, takes, place, in, or, near, such, landmarks, in, yucat, n, also, around, karstic, sinkholes, cenotes, ritual, was, governed, not, only, by, the, geographical, lay, out, of, shrines, and, temples, see, also, maya, architecture, but, also, by, the, projection, of, calendrical, models, onto, the, landscape, in, contemporary, quichean, momostenango, for, example, specific, combinations, of, day, names, and, numbers, are, ascribed, to, specialized, shrines, in, the, mountains, signalling, the, appropriate, times, for, their, ritual, use, in, the, northwestern, maya, highlands, the, four, days, or, day, lords, that, can, start, a, year, are, assigned, to, four, mountains, in, early, colonial, yucat, n, the, thirteen, katun, periods, and, their, deities, mapped, onto, a, landscape, conceived, as, a, wheel, are, said, to, be, successively, established, in, specific, towns, through, pilgrimages, which, create, networks, connecting, places, regionally, as, well, as, over, larger, distances, maya, religion, transcends, the, limits, of, the, local, community, nowadays, pilgrimages, often, involve, reciprocal, visits, of, the, village, saints, as, represented, by, their, statues, but, also, visits, to, farther, removed, sanctuaries, as, exemplified, by, the, q, eqchi, pilgrimages, to, their, thirteen, sacred, mountains, around, 1500, chichen, itza, used, to, attract, pilgrims, from, all, the, surrounding, kingdoms, to, its, large, cenote, other, pilgrims, visited, local, shrines, such, as, those, of, ix, chel, and, other, goddesses, on, the, islands, off, yucat, n, s, east, coast, eight, centuries, earlier, noblemen, from, sundry, classic, kingdoms, went, on, pilgrimage, to, the, caves, of, naj, tunich, and, had, their, visits, recorded, on, the, sanctuary, s, walls, offerings, serve, to, establish, and, renew, relations, contracts, pacts, or, covenants, with, the, other, world, and, the, choice, number, preparation, and, arrangement, of, the, offered, items, such, as, special, maize, breads, maize, and, cacao, drinks, and, honey, liquor, flowers, incense, nodules, rubber, figures, and, also, cigars, obey, to, stringent, rules, in, the, same, way, a, drink, made, of, exactly, 415, grains, of, parched, maize, was, to, be, offered, to, participants, in, a, pre, hispanic, new, year, ritual, and, on, another, occasion, the, precise, number, of, 49, grains, of, maize, mixed, with, copal, incense, was, to, be, burnt, a, well, known, example, of, a, ritual, meal, is, the, holy, mass, of, the, maize, farmer, misa, milpera, celebrated, at, an, improvised, altar, for, the, yucatec, rain, deities, particularly, lacandon, ritual, was, entirely, focused, on, the, feeding, of, the, deities, as, represented, by, their, incense, burners, the, forms, of, sacrifice, might, take, vary, considerably, in, contemporary, sacrificial, rites, there, is, an, overall, emphasis, on, the, sprinkling, of, blood, especially, that, of, turkeys, in, the, pre, hispanic, past, sacrifice, usually, consisted, of, animals, such, as, deer, dog, quail, turkey, and, fish, but, on, exceptional, occasions, such, as, accession, to, the, throne, severe, illness, of, the, ruler, royal, burial, or, drought, and, famine, also, came, to, include, human, beings, adults, as, well, as, children, the, sacrificed, child, may, have, served, as, a, substitute, a, concept, known, from, curing, ritual, partaking, of, the, sacrifice, was, common, but, ritual, cannibalism, appears, to, have, been, exceedingly, rare, a, characteristic, feature, of, ancient, mayan, ritual, though, not, exclusive, to, the, mayas, were, the, bloodletting, sessions, held, by, high, officials, and, members, of, the, royal, families, during, which, the, earlobes, tongues, and, foreskins, were, cut, with, razor, sharp, small, knives, and, stingray, spines, the, blood, fell, on, paper, strips, that, were, possibly, burnt, afterwards, in, the, ancient, maya, cities, all, sorts, of, offertory, items, including, sacrificial, implements, were, also, stored, and, buried, in, deposits, caches, below, architectural, features, such, as, floors, stelae, and, altars, in, these, cases, the, intention, may, often, have, been, a, dedication, to, a, specific, religious, purpose, rather, than, an, offering, to, a, divine, recipient, purificatory, measures, such, as, fasting, sexual, abstention, bathing, and, especially, in, the, pre, hispanic, past, confession, generally, precede, major, ritual, events, in, 16th, century, yucat, n, purification, exorcism, of, evil, spirits, often, represented, a, ritual, s, initial, phase, the, bloodletting, rituals, see, below, may, also, have, had, a, purificatory, function, more, generally, purification, is, needed, before, entering, areas, inhabited, by, deities, in, present, day, yucat, n, for, example, it, is, customary, to, drink, standing, water, from, a, rock, depression, at, the, first, opportunity, upon, entering, the, forest, the, water, is, then, spat, on, the, ground, and, thus, renders, the, individual, virginal, free, to, carry, out, the, business, of, humankind, in, the, sacred, forest, maya, prayer, almost, invariably, accompanies, acts, of, offering, and, sacrifice, it, often, takes, the, form, of, long, litanies, in, which, the, names, of, personified, days, saints, angels, rain, and, lightning, deities, features, of, the, landscape, connected, with, historical, or, mythical, events, and, mountains, are, particularly, prominent, its, importance, is, highlighted, by, the, fact, that, maya, communities, in, the, northwestern, highlands, of, guatemala, have, a, specialized, group, of, prayermakers, prayers, with, their, hypnotizing, scansion, often, show, a, parallel, dyadic, couplet, structure, which, has, also, been, recognized, in, classic, period, texts, the, earliest, prayers, recorded, in, european, script, are, in, quich, and, are, embedded, in, the, creation, myths, of, the, popol, vuh, the, traditional, maya, have, their, own, religious, functionaries, often, hierarchically, organized, and, charged, with, the, duties, of, praying, and, sacrificing, on, behalf, of, lineages, local, groups, or, the, entire, community, in, many, places, they, operate, within, the, catholic, brotherhoods, or, cofrad, as, and, the, so, called, civil, religious, hierarchy, or, cargo, system, organizations, which, have, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, preservation, of, pre, spanish, religious, traditions, the, two, most, important, male, deities, mart, n, and, maxim, n, of, the, tz, utujil, mayas, of, santiago, atitl, n, for, example, have, their, own, brotherhoods, and, priests, public, ritual, focusing, on, agriculture, and, rain, is, led, by, the, godfathers, of, the, wet, season, padrinos, del, invierno, among, the, ch, orti, s, in, a, particularly, rich, and, complex, system, and, by, the, village, priests, jmenob, in, yucat, n, in, the, private, realm, nearly, everywhere, diviners, seers, daykeepers, are, active, together, with, curers, the, performance, of, many, of, the, indigenous, priests, but, especially, of, the, curers, shows, features, also, associated, with, shamanism, knowledge, of, the, earlier, maya, priesthood, is, almost, entirely, based, on, what, their, spanish, missionary, colleagues, have, to, say, about, them, landa, for, yucat, n, las, casas, and, others, for, the, guatemalan, highlands, the, upper, echelon, of, the, priesthood, was, a, repository, of, learning, also, in, the, field, of, history, and, genealogical, knowledge, around, 1500, the, yucatec, priesthood, was, hierarchically, organized, from, the, high, priest, living, at, the, court, down, to, the, priests, in, the, towns, and, the, priestly, books, were, distributed, along, these, lines, the, role, model, for, the, high, priest, is, likely, to, have, been, the, upper, god, itzamna, first, priest, and, inventor, of, the, art, of, writing, the, most, general, word, for, priest, including, the, yucatec, high, priest, appears, to, have, been, ah, k, in, calendrical, priest, some, priests, were, ordinary, diviners, while, others, had, specialized, knowledge, of, the, kingly, katun, cycle, aside, from, calendrical, learning, however, priests, had, multiple, tasks, running, from, performing, life, crisis, rituals, to, managing, the, monthly, feast, cycle, and, held, special, offices, such, as, that, of, oracle, chilan, astrologer, and, sacrificer, of, human, beings, nacom, in, the, k, iche, kingdom, of, q, umarkaj, the, most, important, deities, tohil, awilix, jacawitz, and, gukumatz, had, their, own, high, priests, at, all, levels, access, to, late, postclassic, priesthood, seems, to, have, been, restricted, to, the, nobility, little, is, known, with, certainty, concerning, the, classic, maya, priesthood, iconographically, there, can, be, no, serious, doubt, but, that, the, aged, ascetic, figures, depicted, as, writing, and, reading, books, aspersing, and, inaugurating, dignitaries, and, kings, and, overseeing, human, sacrifice, represent, professional, priests, and, high, priests, at, court, certain, hieroglyphic, titles, of, noblemen,

the, thirteen, twenty, year, periods, katuns, of, the, short, count, were, viewed, as, divine, lords, in, their, own, right, and, worshipped, accordingly, the, katuns, had, specific, divine, patrons,

ascend, into, the, clouds, and, there, to, act, like, rain, deities, themselves, influencing, the, weather, can, also, mean, deflecting, the, rain, clouds, from, neighboring, areas, and, thus, imply, black, sorcery, the, principal, focus, of, the, agricultural, rites, is, the, sowing, and, harvesting, of, the, maize, particularly, the, rituals, of, the, yucatec, and, ch, orti, mayas, have, been,

with, arrows, and, deer, skulls, painted, blue, the, focus, on, animal, skulls, is, significant, since, even, today, traditional, maya, hunters, have, the, duty, to, preserve, the, skulls, and, bones, of, their, booty, deposit, these, periodically, in, hunting, shrines, and, thus, restore, them, to, their, supernatural, owners, for, regeneration, they, should, also, respect, certain, hunting, taboos, such, as, those, on, adultery, and, unnecessarily, wounding, the, game, on, penalty, of, supernatural, sanction, for, this, same, reason, in, another, month, of, the, 16th, century, yucatec,

rain, and, earth, deities, for, earlier, periods, such, crosses, and, shrines, can, perhaps, be, thought, of, as, being, connected, to, the, central, cross, or, world, tree, of, the, center, best,

major, public, rituals, in, the, classic, period, the, rituals, of, kingship, were, the, most, important, rituals, of, the, maya, court, the, term, theatre, state, geertz, originally, coined, for, the, hindu, kingdoms, of, bali, could, also, be, used, for, describing, the, classic, maya, kingdoms, it, suggests, the, cohesion, of, the, state, to, be, dependent, on, elaborate, royal, rituals, through, which, status, differences, between, aristocratic, families, could, find, expression, on, monuments, the, king, sometimes, assumes, a, dancing, posture, suggestive, of, his, participation, in, the, rituals, that, were, staged, on, the, large, plazas, where, the, royal, stelae, stood, on, important, occasions, the, royal, impersonator, would, be, shown, to, the, crowd, while, being,

temple, sanctuaries, of, palenque, the, king, not, only, took, a, leading, part, in, ritual, but, ritual, is, likely, to, have, focused, on, his, office, as, well, the, erection, of, stelae, showing, the, king, and, dedicated, to, the, day, king, ahaw, which, concluded, intervals, of, five, 360, day, years, constituted, a, royal, ritual, by, itself, it, appears, to, implicate, the, king, as, the, divine, lord, of, his, own, day, inversely, at, san, bartolo, the, divine, hero, of, the, day, king, hunahpu, substitutes, for, the, real, king, setting, up, a, stela, may, additionally, have, involved, the, notion, of, the, king, as, a, protective, tree, of, life, moreover, in, the, classic, period, the, king, is, commonly, depicted, holding, a, cosmic, serpent, from, whose, jaws, deities,

and, calendrics, within, the, social, group, of, the, priests, at, court, it, had, by, classical, times, become, customary, to, deify, the, numbers, as, well, as, the, basic, day, unit, and, particularly, in, the, south, eastern, kingdoms, of, copan, and, quirigua, to, conceive, the, mechanism, of, time, as, a, sort, of, relay, or, estafette, in, which, the, burden, of, the, time, units, was, passed, on, from, one, divine, numerical, bearer, to, the, next, one, the, numbers, were, personified, not, by, distinctive, numerical, deities, but, by, some, of, the, principal, general, deities, who, were, thus, seen, to, be, responsible, for, the, ongoing, march, of, time, the, day, units, k, in, were, often, depicted, as, the, patrons, of, the, priestly, scribes, and, diviners, ah,

to, be, governed, by, certain, fundamental, numbers, first, of, all, the, numbers, 13, and, 20, that, multiplied, defined, both, the, mantic, day, count, and, on, a, vast, scale, the, amount, of,

tzolkin, the, length, of, this, calendar, coincides, with, the, average, duration, of, human, gestation, its, basic, purpose, was, and, still, is, to, provide, guidance, in, life, through, a, consideration, of, the, combined, aspects, of, the, 20, named, days, and, 13, numbers, and, to, indicate, the, days, on, which, sacrifice, at, specific, number, shrines, recalling, the, number, deities, of, classic, times, might, lead, to, the, desired, results, the, days, were, commonly, deified, and, invoked, as, lordships, the, crucial, importance, of, divination, is, suggested, by, the, fact, that, the, general, yucatec, word, for, priest, ah, k, in, referred, more, specifically, to, the, counting, of, the, days, k, iche, daykeepers, use, puns, to, help, remember, and, inform, the, meanings, of, the, days, divinatory, techniques, include, the, throwing, and, counting, of, seeds, crystals, and, beans, and, in, the, past, also, apart, from, the, count, gazing, in, a, magical, mirror, scrying, and, reading, the, signs, given, by, birds, auguries, in, the, late, classic, period, pictures, of, such, birds, were, used, as, logograms, for, the, larger, time, periods, the,

to, entities, such, as, the, 260, days, the, cardinal, directions, the, ancestors, of, those, present, important, mayan, towns, and, archaeological, sites, lakes, caves, or, volcanoes, and, deities,

chosen, for, the, enthronement, of, one, of, its, kings, is, also, stated, to, have, witnessed, in, a, distant, mythical, past, the, enthronement, of, some, of, the, patron, deities, of, the, kingdom, what, is, often, called, maya, astronomy, is, really, astrology, that, is, a, priestly, science, resting, on, the, assumption, of, an, influence, exerted, on, earthly, events, by, the, movements, of,

underworld, is, often, assumed, to, have, consisted, of, nine, layers, however, the, popol, vuh, does, not, know, such, a, ninefold, division, and, classic, period, references, to, layers, of, the,

the, ecliptic, the, king, was, probably, identified, with, the, tree, of, the, centre, and, is, usually, shown, to, carry, the, bicephalic, serpent, as, a, ceremonial, bar, besides, worshipping, a,

text, from, palenque, s, temple, xix, seems, to, allude, the, quichean, popol, vuh, does, not, mention, the, collapse, of, the, sky, and, the, establishment, of, the, five, trees, but, focuses, instead, on, a, succession, of, previous, mankinds, the, last, of, which, was, destroyed, by, a, flood, for, the, classic, mayas, the, base, date, of, the, long, count, 4, ahau, 8, cumku, following, upon, the, completion, of, thirteen, previous, baktun, eras, is, thought, to, have, been, the, focus, of, specific, acts, of, creation, through, the, figures, of, two, so, called, paddler, gods, the, mythology, of, the, maya, maize, god, appears, to, have, been, involved, references, to, 4, ahau, 8, cumku, events, are, few, in, number, the, most, important, one, occurring, on, quirigua, stela, c, seemingly, incoherent, and, hard, to, interpret, they, include, an, obscure, conclave, of, seven, deities, in, the, underworld, among, whom, the, deity, bolonyokte, and, a, concept, of, three, stones, usually, taken, to, refer, to, a, cosmic, hearth, the, traditional, mayas, believe, in, the, existence, within, each, individual, of, various, souls, usually, described, in, quasi, material, terms, such, as, shadow, breath, blood, and, bone, the, loss, of, one, or, more, souls, results, in, specific, diseases, generically, called, soul, loss, fright, or, susto, in, classic, maya, texts, certain, glyphs, are, read, as, references, to, the, soul, much, more, is, known, about, the, so, called, co, essences, that, is, animals, or, other, natural, phenomena, comets, lightning, linked, with, the, individual, usually, a, male, and, protecting, him, in, some, cases, often, connected, to, black, sorcery, one, can, change, into, co, essences, acting, like, a, sort, of, werewolves, see, also, nagual, the, classic, maya, grandees, had, a, whole, array, of, such, soul, companions, which, were, called, wayob, and, carried, distinct, hieroglyphic, names, among, them, were, spook, like, creatures, but, also, violent, stars, in, the, pre, spanish, past, there, may, never, have, existed, a, unified, concept, of, the, afterlife, among, the, pokoman, maya, of, the, verapaz, xbalanque, was, to, accompany, the, dead, king, which, suggests, a, descent, into, the, underworld, called, xibalba, place, of, fright, like, that, described, in, the, popol, vuh, twin, myth, the, yucatec, maya, had, a, double, concept, of, the, afterlife, evildoers, descended, into, an, underworld, metnal, to, be, tormented, there, a, view, still, held, by, the, 20th, century, lacandons, while, others, such, as, those, led, by, the, goddess, ixtab, went, to, a, sort, of, paradise, the, ancestors, of, maya, kings, palenque, tomb, of, pakal, berlin, pot, are, shown, sprouting, from, the, earth, like, fruit, trees, which, together, constitute, a, blissful, orchard, the, so, called, flower, mountain, has, more, specifically, been, interpreted, as, a, reference, to, an, aquatic, and, solar, paradise, to, judge, by, the, marine, faunal, remains, found, in, classic, tombs, and, by, the, accompanying, aquatic, imagery, this, sea, paradise, may, have, been, the, maya, variant, of, the, rain, god, s, paradise, tlalocan, in, central, mexican, religion, the, traditional, maya, live, in, the, continual, presence, of, the, grand, fathers, and, grand, mothers, the, usually, anonymous, bilateral, ancestors, who, in, the, highlands, are, often, conceived, of, as, inhabiting, specific, mountains, where, they, expect, the, offerings, of, their, descendants, in, the, past, too, the, ancestors, had, an, important, role, to, play, with, the, difference, that, among, the, nobility, genealogical, memory, and, patrilineal, descent, were, much, more, emphasized, thus, the, popol, vuh, lists, three, genealogies, of, upper, lords, descending, from, three, ancestors, and, their, wives, these, first, male, ancestors, ritually, defined, as, bloodletters, and, sacrificers, had, received, their, private, deities, in, a, legendary, land, of, origins, called, the, seven, caves, and, seven, canyons, nahua, chicomoztoc, and, on, their, disappearance, left, a, sacred, bundle, already, during, the, classic, period, ancestral, deities, such, as, the, three, patron, deities, of, palenque, and, ancestral, bundles, particularly, prominent, in, yaxchilan, are, in, evidence, in, chiapas, at, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, lineage, ancestors, were, believed, to, have, emerged, from, the, roots, of, a, ceiba, tree, comparable, beliefs, still, exist, amongst, the, tz, utujiles, within, the, group, of, the, ancestors, a, special, category, is, constituted, by, the, heroes, best, known, through, the, sixteenth, century, quichean, epic, of, the, maya, hero, twins, hunahpu, and, xbalanque, in, the, classic, period, the, adventures, of, these, two, heroes, only, partly, coinciding, with, those, of, the, popol, vuh, were, known, all, over, the, mayan, area, specific, ancestral, heroes, occur, among, various, traditional, maya, groups, such, as, the, dwarfish, ez, among, the, yucatec, mayas, juan, k, anil, among, the, jacaltecs, of, the, northwestern, highlands, ohoroxtotil, the, jaguar, slayer, among, the, tzotziles, of, chiapas, and, kumix, among, the, ch, orti, mayas, the, heroes, actions, can, belong, to, a, relatively, recent, past, and, be, semi, historical, or, have, occurred, in, the, deep, past, and, be, primeval, but, in, principle, the, heroes, can, be, addressed, in, prayer, and, receive, some, form, of, worship, sometimes, they, have, merged, with, specific, military, saints, the, ancient, maya, concept, of, deity, or, divinity, k, u, in, yucatec, ch, u, in, ch, ol, and, qabuvil, in, ancient, quich, can, by, no, means, be, reduced, to, a, mere, personification, of, natural, phenomena, the, life, cycle, of, the, maize, for, instance, lies, at, the, heart, of, maya, belief, but, the, role, of, the, principal, maya, maize, god, transcends, the, sphere, of, agriculture, to, embrace, basic, aspects, of, civilized, life, in, general, such, as, writing, deities, have, all, sorts, of, social, functions, related, to, such, human, activities, as, agriculture, midwifery, trade, and, warfare, moreover, they, can, be, the, patrons, of, large, kin, based, ethnic, or, localized, segments, of, society, as, shown, by, the, four, deities, presiding, over, the, four, wards, of, the, town, of, itzamkanac, the, popol, vuh, triad, of, lineage, gods, tohil, hacavitz, avilix, and, probably, also, by, the, palenque, triad, g, i, ii, and, iii, and, its, classic, period, analogues, elsewhere, such, patron, deities, who, may, be, either, place, specific, or, instances, of, a, general, deity, tend, to, have, an, intimate, relationship, with, the, associated, community, and, its, representative, in, classic, inscriptions, usually, the, king, by, whom, they, are, bathed, dressed, and, fed, from, the, multitude, of, deity, names, occurring, in, early, colonial, sources, and, especially, in, the, medical, rituals, of, the, bacabs, about, twenty, have, been, linked, to, deity, figures, from, the, three, postclassic, hieroglyphic, books, and, their, correspondences, in, the, corpus, of, classic, ceramic, representations, these, have, been, assigned, letter, names, schellhas, zimmermann, taube, classification, the, codices, demonstrate, that, deities, were, permanently, being, arranged, and, rearranged, according, to, cultic, criteria, which, usually, are, not, immediately, accessible, to, us, moreover, maya, deities, typically, operate, within, various, fields, changing, attributes, accordingly, with, the, provisos, formulated, above, the, main, deities, depicted, in, the, codices, can, be, roughly, divided, into, the, following, groups, the, names, given, are, 16th, century, yucatec, within, the, three, hieroglyphic, codices, the, group, of, male, deities, is, highly, differentiated, but, the, female, functions, seem, largely, to, have, been, concentrated, in, the, young, goddess, i, the, white, woman, and, the, old, goddess, o, the, red, woman, the, postclassic, maya, deity, kukulcan, feathered, serpent, tutelary, deity, of, the, toltec, invaders, and, of, the, maya, kings, deriving, their, legitimacy, from, them, is, nearly, absent, from, the, hieroglyphic, codices, although, the, classic, hero, twins, are, among, the, codical, deities, their, associate, the, classic, maize, hero, or, tonsured, maize, god, seems, to, be, absent, entirely, missing, from, the, codices, but, important, in, classic, iconography, are, amongst, others, an, ocean, deity, characterized, by, a, shark, tooth, set, in, the, mouth, who, is, also, the, god, i, of, the, palenque, triad, and, some, of, the, maya, jaguar, gods, associated, with, warfare, in, the, framework, of, the, classic, period, the, omnipresent, lightning, deity, is, usually, referred, to, as, k, awiil, powerful, one, in, maya, folk, religion, the, members, of, the, catholic, trinity, the, virgin, mary, a, number, of, saints, the, archangels, and, the, devil, have, usually, merged, with, traditional, deities, patron, deities, and, ancestral, heroes, angels, for, example, generally, represent, rain, deities, the, complex, figure, of, the, mam, grandfather, maxim, n, venerated, in, santiago, atitlan, is, another, example, of, such, syncretism, the, deities, governing, the, wild, vegetation, the, game, animals, and, the, fishes, are, often, referred, to, as, owners, or, masters, due, os, like, the, mountain, valley, deities, or, mountain, spirits, of, the, highlands, more, generally, the, living, earth, and, its, male, personification, is, often, called, world, mundo, animal, persons, usually, mammals, and, birds, but, including, insects, appear, to, enjoy, a, relative, autonomy, which, is, lacking, in, the, case, of, the, animal, co, essences, perhaps, representing, the, transformed, human, beings, of, a, former, creation, they, mirror, human, society, in, playing, varying, social, roles, in, the, popol, vuh, for, example, grandfather, great, white, peccary, and, grandmother, great, white, coati, act, as, healers, whereas, the, owl, messengers, of, the, lords, of, the, underworld, wear, military, titles, turning, to, the, ceramic, codex, one, finds, that, animal, persons, are, often, dressing, and, acting, like, persons, at, court, the, howler, monkey, for, example, is, commonly, depicted, in, the, social, role, of, a, writer, and, sculptor, and, functions, as, a, divine, patron, of, these, arts, while, other, mammals, act, as, musicians, animals, also, fulfill, important, ritual, roles, in, the, new, year, rites, of, the, dresden, codex, for, example, an, opossum, traveler, introduces, the, patron, of, the, incoming, year, similarly, in, the, paris, codex, a, turkey, person, alternates, with, deities, in, offering, the, head, of, the, lightning, deity, god, k, to, the, new, king, the, dresden, codex, has, various, animals, seated, in, between, deities, most, of, them, clothed, as, human, beings, a, pattern, repeated, in, the, mixed, arrays, of, deities, and, animal, persons, seated, before, the, throne, in, certain, classic, cylinder, vase, scenes, adding, to, their, social, and, ritual, roles, animals, have, also, been, argued, to, represent, lineage, names, the, power, exercised, by, a, deity, is, legitimate, and, this, legitimacy, justifies, offerings, and, sacrifice, unlike, the, gods, of, disease, and, death, spooks, apparitions, and, demons, have, no, such, legitimacy, whereas, spooks, like, the, specters, of, the, dead, only, frighten, and, in, that, way, can, also, cause, disease, demons, are, devourers, in, practice, however, the, borderline, can, be, thin, one, of, the, best, known, spooks, is, an, attractive, woman, maddening, the, men, who, give, in, to, her, lures, known, in, yucatec, as, the, xtabay, female, ensnarer, spooks, of, the, tzotziles, include, such, figures, as, the, charcoal, cruncher, the, one, who, drops, his, own, flesh, and, white, bundle, the, boundary, between, spooks, like, these, and, the, wayob, of, the, classic, period, is, not, always, entirely, clear, the, principal, demon, of, the, tzotzil, area, is, the, black, man, h, ik, al, a, kidnapper, and, rapist, an, ancient, mesoamerican, bird, demon, which, the, popol, vuh, calls, vucub, caquix, severed, the, limbs, of, his, victims, and, was, already, known, in, preclassic, izapa, in, order, to, terrorize, their, enemies, kings, would, at, times, assume, the, shapes, of, spooks, and, demons, bush, spirits, such, as, the, wild, man, or, salvaje, belong, to, the, frightening, denizens, of, uninhabited, areas, without, however, being, apparitions, according, to, yucatec, belief, the, indigenous, priests, can, create, goblins, aluxob, who, if, properly, attended, will, assist, the, farmer, in, his, work, by, protecting, his, field, having, the, rain, deities, visit, it, and, thus, making, the, maize, grow, in, the, same, area, dwarfs, and, also, hunchbacks, are, associated, with, antediluvial, times, they, perished, in, the, flood, when, their, stone, boats, sank, the, childlike, dwarfs, and, hunchbacks, of, classic, iconography, often, accompany, the, king, and, the, tonsured, maize, god, they, repeatedly, show, aquatic, features, and, may, in, such, cases, be, identical, to, the, dwarfish, assistants, of, the, deities, of, rain, lightning, and, thunder, already, mentioned, in, aztec, sources, the, tlaloqueh, there, is, considerable, diversity, in, recent, religious, narrative, which, embraces, stereotypical, moralizing, stories, about, encounters, with, mountain, spirits, and, supernatural, owners, as, well, as, myths, concerning, heroes, and, deities, particularly, in, tales, concerned, with, the, creation, of, the, earth, and, the, origin, of, useful, plants, a, reworking, of, catholic, imagery, is, often, noticeable, among, the, best, known, myths, are, those, about, the, opening, of, the, maize, mountain, by, the, lightning, deities, the, struggle, of, sun, and, his, elder, brethren, and, the, marriage, of, sun, and, moon, the, early, colonial, quichean, twin, myth, set, out, in, the, popol, vuh, has, not, been, transmitted, although, fragments, are, recognizable, in, recent, narrative, the, name, of, one, of, its, heroes, xbalanque, was, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, still, known, in, the, alta, verapaz, early, creation, mythology, is, found, in, the, popol, vuh, and, in, some, of, the, books, of, chilam, balam, notwithstanding, the, progress, in, hieroglyphic, decipherment, the, most, important, sources, for, classic, mythology, are, still, scenes, painted, on, pottery, the, so, called, ceramic, codex, and, monumental, iconography, the, two, principal, narratives, recognized, thus, far, are, about, demigods, close, to, humanity, the, hero, twins, and, the, principal, maya, maize, god, and, have, to, be, reconstructed, from, scenes, in, which, often, narrative, and, ritual, concerns, are, intertwined, like, other, mesoamerican, populations, maya, societies, since, the, spanish, conquest, have, known, a, series, of, religious, revitalization, movements, of, a, more, or, less, violent, character, and, in, response, to, intolerable, exploitation, by, non, maya, outsiders, these, movements, usually, followed, the, appearances, of, supernatural, beings, in, chiapas, early, 18th, and, late, 19th, century, the, ensuing, cults, focused, on, female,
