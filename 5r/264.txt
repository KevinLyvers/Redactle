have, a, literal, meaning, he, further, notes, that, even, when, mantras, do, not, have, a, literal, meaning, they, do, set, a, tone, and, ambiance, in, the, ritual, as, they, are, recited, and, thus, have, a, straightforward, and, uncontroversial, ritualistic, meaning, the, sounds, may, lack, literal, meaning, but, they, can, have, an, effect, he, compares, mantras, to, bird, songs, that, have, the, power, to, communicate, yet, do, not, have, a, literal, meaning, on, that, saman, category, of, hindu, mantras, which, staal, described, as, resembling, the, arias, of, bach, s, oratorios, and, other, european, classics, he, notes, that, these, mantras, have, musical, structure, but, they, almost, always, are, completely, different, from, anything, in, the, syntax, of, natural, languages,

they, admit, staal, s, observation, that, many, mantras, do, contain, bits, and, pieces, of, meaningless, jargon, but, they, question, what, language, or, text, doesn, t, the, presence, of, an,

and, even, mundane, petitions, he, suggests, that, from, a, set, of, millions, of, mantras, the, devotee, chooses, some, mantras, voluntarily, thus, expressing, that, speaker, s, intention, and, the, audience, for, that, mantra, is, that, speaker, s, chosen, spiritual, entity, mantras, deploy, the, language, of, spiritual, expression, they, are, religious, instruments, and, that, is, what,

acting, as, a, part, of, the, supreme, method, of, meditation, and, spiritual, practice, one, popular, bija, seed, mantra, in, mahayana, buddhism, is, the, sanskrit, letter, a, see, a, in, buddhism, this, seed, mantra, was, equated, with, mahayana, doctrines, like, praj, aparamita, the, perfection, of, wisdom, emptiness, and, non, arising, this, seed, mantra, remains, in, use, in, shingon, dzogchen, and, rinzai, zen, mahayana, buddhism, also, adopted, the, om, mantra, which, is, found, incorporated, into, various, mahayana, buddhist, mantras, like, the, popular, om, mani, padme, hum, another, early, and, influential, mahayana, mantra, or, dharani, is, the, arapacana, alphabet, of, non, sanskrit, origin, possibly, karosthi, which, is, used, as, a, contemplative, tool, in, the, long, praj, p, ramit, sutras, the, entire, alphabet, runs, a, ra, pa, ca, na, la, da, ba, a, a, va, ta, ya, a, ka, sa, ma, ga, stha, ja, va, dha, a, kha, k, a, sta, j, a, rta, ha, bha, cha, sma, hva, tsa, bha, ha, a, pha, ska, ysa, ca, a, ha, in, this, practice, each, letter, stood, for, a, specific, idea, for, example, a, stands, for, non, arising, anutpada, and, pa, stands, for, ultimate, truth, param, rtha, as, such, this, practice, was, also, a, kind, of, mnemonic, technique, dh, ra, mukha, which, allowed, one, to, remember, the, key, points, of, the, teaching, the, mahayana, sutras, introduced, various, mantras, into, mahayana, buddhism, such, as, in, chinese, buddhism, various, mantras, including, the, great, compassion, mantra, the, u, a, vijaya, dh, ra, from, the, u, a, vijaya, dh, ra, sutra, the, mah, m, y, r, vidy, r, j, dh, ra, the, heart, sutra, and, various, forms, of, buddha, remembrance, are, commonly, chanted, by, both, monastics, and, laymen, in, china, and, vietnam, a, set, of, mantras, known, as, the, ten, small, mantras, chinese, pinyin, sh, xi, ozh, u, was, established, by, the, monk, yulin, chinese, pinyin, y, l, n, gu, sh, a, teacher, of, the, qing, dynasty, shunzhi, emperor, 1638, 1661, for, monks, nuns, and, laity, to, chant, during, morning, liturgical, services, this, set, of, mantras, is, still, chanted, in, modern, chinese, buddhism, zen, buddhism, also, makes, use, of, esoteric, mantras, a, practice, which, can, be, traced, back, to, the, tang, dynasty, mantras, and, dharanis, are, recited, in, all, zen, traditions, including, japanese, zen, korean, seon, chinese, chan, and, vietnamese, thien, one, of, these, is, the, ra, gama, dharani, which, has, been, taught, by, various, modern, chan, and, zen, monks, such, as, venerable, hsuan, hua, this, long, dharani, is, associated, with, the, protective, deity, sitatpatra, the, short, heart, mantra, of, this, dharani, is, also, popular, in, east, asian, buddhism, shaolin, temple, monks, also, made, use, of, esoteric, mantras, and, dharani, chinese, esoteric, buddhism, also, known, as, zh, ny, n, chinese, lit, true, word, which, is, the, translation, for, mantra, draws, extensively, on, mantras, this, tradition, was, established, during, the, tang, dynasty, by, indian, tantric, masters, like, ubhakarasi, ha, vajrabodhi, and, amoghavajra, chinese, esoteric, buddhist, practice, was, based, on, deity, yoga, and, the, three, mysteries, mantra, mudra, and, mandala, these, three, mysteries, allow, the, buddhist, yogi, to, tap, into, the, body, speech, and, mind, of, the, buddhas, this, tradition, was, transmitted, to, japan, by, k, kai, 774, 835, who, founded, the, japanese, shingon, japanese, for, zh, ny, n, mantra, vehicle, k, kai, saw, a, mantra, as, a, manifestation, of, the, true, nature, of, reality, which, is, saturated, with, meaning, for, k, kai, a, mantra, is, nothing, but, the, speech, of, the, buddha, mahavairocana, the, ground, dharmakaya, which, is, the, ultimate, source, of, all, reality, according, to, k, kai, shingon, mantras, contain, the, entire, meaning, of, all, the, scriptures, and, indeed, the, entire, universe, which, is, itself, the, sermon, of, the, dharmakaya, k, kai, argues, that, mantras, are, effective, because, a, mantra, is, suprarational, it, eliminates, ignorance, when, meditated, upon, and, recited, a, single, word, contains, a, thousand, truths, one, can, realize, suchness, here, and, now, one, of, k, kai, s, distinctive, contributions, was, to, take, this, symbolic, association, even, further, by, saying, that, there, is, no, essential, difference, between, the, syllables, of, mantras, and, sacred, texts, and, those, of, ordinary, language, if, one, understood, the, workings, of, mantra, then, any, sounds, could, be, a, representative, of, ultimate, reality, this, emphasis, on, sounds, was, one, of, the, drivers, for, k, kai, s, championing, of, the, phonetic, writing, system, the, kana, which, was, adopted, in, japan, around, the, time, of, k, kai, he, is, generally, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, kana, but, there, is, apparently, some, doubt, about, this, story, amongst, scholars, this, mantra, based, theory, of, language, had, a, powerful, effect, on, japanese, thought, and, society, which, up, until, k, kai, s, time, had, been, dominated, by, imported, chinese, culture, of, thought, particularly, in, the, form, of, the, classical, chinese, language, which, was, used, in, the, court, and, amongst, the, literati, and, confucianism, which, was, the, dominant, political, ideology, in, particular, k, kai, was, able, to, use, this, new, theory, of, language, to, create, links, between, indigenous, japanese, culture, and, buddhism, for, instance, he, made, a, link, between, the, buddha, mahavairocana, and, the, shinto, sun, goddess, amaterasu, since, the, emperors, were, thought, to, be, descended, form, amaterasu, k, kai, had, found, a, powerful, connection, here, that, linked, the, emperors, with, the, buddha, and, also, in, finding, a, way, to, integrate, shinto, with, buddhism, something, that, had, not, happened, with, confucianism, buddhism, then, became, essentially, an, indigenous, religion, in, a, way, that, confucianism, had, not, and, it, was, through, language, and, mantra, that, this, connection, was, made, k, kai, helped, to, elucidate, what, mantra, is, in, a, way, that, had, not, been, done, before, he, addresses, the, fundamental, questions, of, what, a, text, is, how, signs, function, and, above, all, what, language, is, in, this, he, covers, some, of, the, same, ground, as, modern, day, structuralists, and, others, scholars, of, language, although, he, comes, to, very, different, conclusions, in, this, system, of, thought, all, sounds, are, said, to, originate, from, a, for, esoteric, buddhism, a, has, a, special, function, because, it, is, associated, with, shunyata, or, the, idea, that, no, thing, exists, in, its, own, right, but, is, contingent, upon, causes, and, conditions, see, dependent, origination, in, sanskrit, a, is, a, prefix, which, changes, the, meaning, of, a, word, into, its, opposite, so, vidya, is, understanding, and, avidya, is, ignorance, the, same, arrangement, is, also, found, in, many, greek, words, like, e, g, atheism, vs, theism, and, apathy, vs, pathos, the, letter, a, is, both, visualised, in, the, siddham, script, and, pronounced, in, rituals, and, meditation, practices, in, the, mahavairocana, sutra, which, is, central, to, shingon, buddhism, it, says, thanks, to, the, original, vows, of, the, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, a, miraculous, force, resides, in, the, mantras, so, that, by, pronouncing, them, one, acquires, merit, without, limits, a, mantra, is, kuji, kiri, in, shingon, as, well, as, in, shugendo, the, practice, of, writing, mantras, and, copying, texts, as, a, spiritual, practice, became, very, refined, in, japan, and, some, of, these, are, written, in, the, japanese, script, and, siddham, script, of, sanskrit, recited, in, either, language, there, are, thirteen, mantras, used, in, shingon, buddhism, each, dedicated, to, a, major, deity, the, thirteen, buddhas, j, sanbutsu, of, shingon, the, mantras, are, drawn, from, the, vairocan, bhisa, bodhi, s, tra, the, mantra, for, each, deity, name, in, japanese, its, equivalent, name, in, sanskrit, the, sanskrit, mantra, and, the, japanese, version, in, the, shingon, tradition, are, as, follows, mantras, are, also, an, important, element, of, other, japanese, buddhist, traditions, the, tendai, school, includes, extensive, repertoire, of, esoteric, buddhist, practices, which, include, the, use, of, mantras, nichiren, buddhist, practice, focuses, on, the, chanting, of, one, single, mantra, or, phrase, nam, my, h, renge, ky, which, means, homage, to, the, lotus, sutra, japanese, zen, also, makes, use, of, mantras, one, example, is, the, mantra, of, light, k, my, shingon, which, is, common, in, japanese, soto, zen, and, was, derived, from, the, shingon, sect, the, use, of, esoteric, practices, such, as, mantra, within, zen, is, sometimes, termed, mixed, zen, kensh, zen, keizan, j, kin, 1264, 1325, is, seen, as, a, key, figure, that, introduced, this, practice, into, the, soto, school, a, common, mantra, used, in, soto, zen, is, the, ra, gama, mantra, ry, gon, shu, t, 944a, mantrayana, sanskrit, which, may, be, translated, as, way, of, the, mantra, was, the, original, self, identifying, name, of, those, that, have, come, to, be, determined, nyingmapa, the, nyingmapa, which, may, be, rendered, as, those, of, the, ancient, way, a, name, constructed, due, to, the, genesis, of, the, sarma, fresh, new, traditions, mantrayana, has, developed, into, a, synonym, of, vajrayana, according, to, the, important, mantrayana, buddhist, text, called, the, ma, ju, r, m, lakalpa, mantras, are, efficacious, because, they, are, manifestations, of, the, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, as, such, a, mantra, is, coextensive, with, the, bodies, of, the, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, when, one, recites, a, mantra, one, s, mind, is, coextensive, with, the, mantras, and, thus, one, s, mind, makes, a, connection, with, the, mantra, s, deity, and, their, meditative, power, samadhi, bala, probably, the, most, famous, mantra, of, buddhism, is, om, mani, padme, hum, the, six, syllable, mantra, of, the, bodhisattva, of, compassion, avalokite, vara, tibetan, chenrezig, chinese, guanyin, this, mantra, is, particularly, associated, with, the, four, armed, shadakshari, form, of, avalokite, vara, the, dalai, lama, is, said, to, be, an, incarnation, of, avalokiteshvara, and, so, the, mantra, is, especially, revered, by, his, devotees, the, book, foundations, of, tibetan, mysticism, by, lama, anagarika, govinda, gives, a, classic, example, of, how, such, a, mantra, can, contain, many, levels, of, symbolic, meaning, the, following, list, of, mantras, is, from, kailash, a, journal, of, himalayan, studies, volume, 1, number, 2, 1973, pp, 168, 169, augmented, by, other, contributors, the, mantras, used, in, tibetan, buddhist, practice, are, in, sanskrit, to, preserve, the, original, mantras, visualizations, and, other, practices, are, usually, done, in, the, tibetan, language, according, to, tibetan, buddhism, this, mantra, om, tare, tutare, ture, soha, can, not, only, eliminate, disease, troubles, disasters, and, karma, but, will, also, bring, believers, blessings, longer, life, and, even, the, wisdom, to, transcend, one, s, circle, of, reincarnation, tara, representing, long, life, and, health, there, are, also, numerous, mantras, in, the, b, n, religion, such, as, om, ma, tri, mu, ye, sa, le, du, in, zoroastrianism, the, use, of, mantras, avestan, m, ra, goes, back, to, zarathustra, himself, who, describes, his, role, as, a, prophet, of, the, creator, deity, ahura, mazda, explicitly, as, a, knower, of, mantras, avestan, m, ran, sanskrit, m, ntrin, in, the, zoroastrian, tradition, a, mantra, is, usually, a, shorter, inspired, utterance, that, accompanies, religious, rituals, they, differ, from, the, longer, often, eight, syllable, praise, songs, called, yasht, in, the, avesta, as, well, as, the, often, eleven, syllable, songs, called, gathas, in, the, avesta, as, well, as, in, the, vedas, the, four, most, important, zoroastrian, mantras, are, the, ahuna, vairya, the, ashem, vohu, the, yenghe, hatam, and, the, airyaman, ishya, the, ashem, vohu, states, a, m, voh, vahi, t, m, ast, u, t, ast, u, t, ahm, i, hyat, a, i, vahi, t, i, a, m, holiness, asha, is, the, best, of, all, good, it, is, also, happiness, happy, the, man, who, is, holy, with, perfect, holiness, ashem, vohu, both, vedic, and, avestan, mantras, have, a, number, of, functional, similarities, one, of, these, is, the, idea, that, truth, when, properly, expressed, in, the, mantra, can, compel, a, deity, to, grant, the, speaker, s, request, compare, sacca, kiriya, another, similarity, is, the, vedic, and, avestic, association, of, mantras, with, paths, so, that, a, properly, formulated, mantra, can, open, a, path, to, the, deity, addressed, because, of, the, etymological, and, conceptual, similarity, such, religious, utterances, must, therefore, have, already, been, known, during, the, common, indo, iranian, period, when, the, people, of, the, avesta, and, of, the, vedas, formed, a, single, people, they, are, therefore, not, derived, from, the, vedic, tradition, but, represent, an, independent, development, of, ancient, iran, corresponding, to, that, in, ancient, india, the, study, of, their, commonalities, is, therefore, important, for, understanding, the, poetic, and, religious, traditions, of, the, early, indo, iranians, in, jainism, mantras, are, mainl, used, for, praising, the, omniscient, enlightened, ones, arihants, or, praising, the, five, supreme, types, of, beings, pa, ca, parame, hi, some, mantras, are, also, used, for, seeking, forgiveness, or, to, enhance, intellect, prosperity, wealth, or, fame, there, are, many, mantras, in, jainism, most, of, them, are, in, sanskrit, or, prakrit, but, in, the, last, few, centuries, some, have, been, composed, in, hindi, or, gujrati, languages, mantras, couplets, are, either, chanted, or, sung, either, aloud, or, by, merely, moving, lips, or, in, silence, by, thought, some, examples, of, jain, mantras, are, bhaktamara, stotra, uvasagharam, stotra, and, rishi, mandal, mantra, the, greatest, is, the, namokar, or,
