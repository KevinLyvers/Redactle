a, sophist, greek, romanized, sophist, s, was, a, teacher, in, ancient, greece, in, the, fifth, and, fourth, centuries, bce, sophists, specialized, in, one, or, more, subject, areas, such, as, philosophy, rhetoric, music, athletics, and, mathematics, they, taught, arete, virtue, or, excellence, predominantly, to, young, statesmen, and, nobility, the, greek, word, sophos, a, wise, man, is, related, to, the, noun, sophia, wisdom, since, the, times, of, homer, it, commonly, referred, to, an, expert, in, his, profession, or, craft, charioteers, sculptors, or, military, experts, could, be, referred, to, as, sophoi, in, their, occupations, the, word, has, gradually, come, to, connote, general, wisdom, and, especially, wisdom, in, human, affairs, such, as, politics, ethics, and, household, management, this, was, the, meaning, ascribed, to, the, greek, seven, sages, of, 7th, and, 6th, century, bce, such, as, solon, and, thales, and, it, was, the, meaning, that, appears, in, the, histories, of, herodotus, the, word, gives, rise, to, the, verb, sophizo, to, instruct, make, learned, the, passive, voice, of, which, means, to, become, or, be, wise, or, to, be, clever, or, skilled, from, the, verb, is, derived, the, noun, sophistes, which, originally, meant, a, master, of, one, s, craft, and, later, a, prudent, man, or, wise, man, the, word, for, sophist, in, various, languages, comes, from, sophistes, the, word, sophist, could, be, combined, with, other, greek, words, to, form, compounds, examples, include, meteorosophist, which, roughly, translates, to, expert, in, celestial, phenomena, gymnosophist, or, naked, sophist, a, word, used, to, refer, to, indian, philosophers, deipnosophist, or, dinner, sophist, as, in, the, title, of, athenaeus, s, deipnosophistae, and, iatrosophist, a, type, of, physician, in, the, later, roman, period, in, the, second, half, of, the, 5th, century, bce, particularly, in, athens, sophist, came, to, denote, a, class, of, mostly, itinerant, intellectuals, who, taught, courses, in, various, subjects, speculated, about, the, nature, of, language, and, culture, and, employed, rhetoric, to, achieve, their, purposes, generally, to, persuade, or, convince, others, sophists, did, however, have, one, important, thing, in, common, whatever, else, they, did, or, did, not, claim, to, know, they, characteristically, had, a, great, understanding, of, what, words, would, entertain, or, impress, or, persuade, an, audience, sophists, went, to, athens, to, teach, because, the, city, was, flourishing, at, the, time, it, was, good, employment, for, those, good, at, debate, which, was, a, speciality, of, the, first, sophists, and, they, received, the, fame, and, fortune, they, were, seeking, protagoras, is, generally, regarded, as, the, first, of, these, professional, sophists, others, include, gorgias, prodicus, hippias, thrasymachus, lycophron, callicles, antiphon, and, cratylus, a, few, sophists, claimed, that, they, could, find, the, answers, to, all, questions, most, of, these, sophists, are, known, today, primarily, through, the, writings, of, their, opponents, particularly, plato, and, aristotle, which, makes, it, difficult, to, assemble, an, unbiased, view, of, their, practices, and, teachings, in, some, cases, such, as, gorgias, original, rhetorical, works, are, extant, allowing, the, author, to, be, judged, on, his, own, terms, but, in, most, cases, knowledge, about, what, individual, sophists, wrote, or, said, comes, from, fragmentary, quotations, that, lack, context, and, are, usually, hostile, the, greeks, were, experimenting, with, a, new, form, of, government, democracy, w, keith, 5, therefore, they, were, navigating, how, to, make, decisions, without, a, higher, authority, they, needed, to, create, laws, based, on, demand, and, popular, vote, of, the, people, back, in, the, fifth, century, they, did, not, have, mass, media, printing, presses, and, barely, any, texts, they, mostly, relied, on, speech, this, meant, that, the, athenians, needed, a, strategy, for, effectively, talking, to, other, people, in, juries, in, forums, and, in, the, senate, w, keith, 5, this, is, when, the, sophist, began, to, come, about, originally, known, as, sicilians, they, began, to, teach, athenians, how, to, speak, in, a, persuasive, manner, in, order, to, work, with, the, courts, and, senate, it, is, not, really, known, how, these, sicilians, who, came, to, be, sophists, initially, grew, an, interest, to, teach, others, how, to, speak, persuasively, however, the, interest, in, receiving, training, from, the, sophists, increased, the, origins, of, rhetoric, keith, lundberg, sophists, could, be, described, both, as, teachers, and, philosophers, having, travelled, about, in, greece, teaching, their, students, various, life, skills, particularly, rhetoric, and, public, speaking, these, were, useful, qualities, of, the, time, during, which, persuasive, ability, had, a, large, influence, on, one, s, political, power, and, economic, wealth, athens, became, the, center, of, the, sophists, activity, due, to, the, city, s, freedom, of, speech, for, non, slave, citizens, and, its, wealth, of, resources, the, sophists, as, a, group, had, no, set, teachings, and, they, lectured, on, subjects, that, were, as, diverse, as, semantics, and, rhetoric, to, ontology, and, epistemology, most, sophists, claimed, to, teach, arete, excellence, or, virtue, in, the, management, and, administration, of, not, only, one, s, affairs, but, the, city, s, as, well, before, the, 5th, century, bce, it, was, believed, that, aristocratic, birth, qualified, a, person, for, arete, and, politics, however, protagoras, who, is, regarded, as, the, first, sophist, argued, that, arete, was, the, result, of, training, rather, than, birth, most, of, what, is, known, about, sophists, comes, from, commentaries, from, others, in, some, cases, such, as, gorgias, some, of, his, works, survive, allowing, the, author, to, be, judged, on, his, own, terms, in, one, case, the, dissoi, logoi, an, important, sophist, text, survived, but, knowledge, of, its, author, has, been, lost, however, most, knowledge, of, sophist, thought, comes, from, fragmentary, quotations, that, lack, context, many, of, these, quotations, come, from, aristotle, who, seems, to, have, held, the, sophists, in, slight, regard, protagoras, was, one, of, the, best, known, and, most, successful, sophists, of, his, era, however, some, later, philosophers, such, as, sextus, empiricus, treat, him, as, a, founder, of, a, philosophy, rather, than, as, a, sophist, protagoras, taught, his, students, the, necessary, skills, and, knowledge, for, a, successful, life, particularly, in, politics, he, trained, his, pupils, to, argue, from, both, points, of, view, because, he, believed, that, truth, could, not, be, limited, to, just, one, side, of, the, argument, protagoras, wrote, about, a, variety, of, subjects, and, advanced, several, philosophical, ideas, particularly, in, epistemology, some, fragments, of, his, works, have, survived, he, is, the, author, of, the, famous, saying, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, which, is, the, opening, sentence, of, a, work, called, truth, xeniades, was, a, skeptical, philosopher, from, corinth, probably, a, follower, of, the, pre, socratic, xenophanes, there, may, have, been, two, such, persons, as, he, is, referenced, by, democritus, c, 400, bce, though, was, also, supposedly, the, purchaser, of, diogenes, the, cynic, c, 350, bce, when, he, was, captured, by, pirates, and, sold, as, a, slave, xeniades, was, supposed, to, have, been, the, man, who, persuaded, monimus, to, become, a, follower, of, diogenes, and, was, the, source, of, his, skeptical, doctrines, the, little, that, is, known, of, him, is, derived, from, sextus, empiricus, who, represents, him, as, holding, the, most, ultrasceptical, opinions, and, maintaining, that, all, notions, are, false, and, that, there, is, absolutely, nothing, true, in, the, universe, he, more, than, once, couples, him, with, xenophanes, gorgias, was, a, well, known, sophist, whose, writings, showcased, his, ability, to, make, counter, intuitive, and, unpopular, positions, appear, stronger, gorgias, authored, a, lost, work, known, as, on, the, non, existent, which, argues, that, nothing, exists, in, it, he, attempts, to, persuade, his, readers, that, thought, and, existence, are, different, he, also, wrote, encomium, of, helen, in, which, he, presents, all, of, the, possible, reasons, for, which, helen, could, be, blamed, for, causing, the, trojan, war, and, refutes, each, one, of, them, lycophron, is, mentioned, as, a, sophist, by, aristotle, and, was, probably, among, the, students, of, gorgias, he, rejected, the, supposed, value, of, an, aristocratic, birth, claiming, that, now, the, nobility, of, good, birth, is, obscure, and, its, grandeur, a, matter, of, words, meaning, that, there, is, no, factual, difference, between, those, well, born, and, those, low, born, only, words, and, opinion, assign, value, to, these, different, circumstances, of, birth, this, statement, may, indicate, that, lycophron, shared, the, beliefs, of, antiphon, that, regardless, of, their, ancestry, both, greeks, and, barbarians, are, born, with, the, same, capacities, an, egalitarian, belief, that, was, a, minority, view, in, the, 5th, century, bce, he, is, also, known, for, his, statement, reproduced, by, aristotle, in, the, latter, s, politics, 1280b10, that, law, is, only, a, convention, a, surety, to, another, of, justice, also, translated, as, a, guarantor, of, men, s, rights, against, one, another, he, thus, believed, that, law, is, a, matter, of, agreement, a, social, convention, and, not, a, natural, or, universal, standard, there, is, no, evidence, that, lycophron, rejected, the, idea, that, law, is, a, universal, standard, indeed, his, view, appears, far, more, universalist, than, that, of, aristotle, in, that, lycophron, proposes, a, single, standard, what, would, now, be, called, the, non, aggression, principle, in, relation, to, all, states, in, this, respect, his, views, on, law, are, similar, to, those, of, protagoras, this, means, that, he, treats, law, as, a, mere, means, in, the, context, of, a, perhaps, primitive, social, contract, theory, without, considering, it, as, something, special, in, contradistinction, to, e, g, plato, but, similar, to, both, thrasymachus, and, callicles, albeit, that, their, theories, have, as, far, as, can, be, ascertained, from, the, information, available, about, them, more, specific, characteristics, many, sophists, taught, their, skills, for, a, price, due, to, the, importance, of, such, skills, in, the, litigious, social, life, of, athens, practitioners, often, commanded, very, high, fees, the, sophists, practice, of, questioning, the, existence, and, roles, of, traditional, deities, and, investigating, into, the, nature, of, the, heavens, and, the, earth, prompted, a, popular, reaction, against, them, as, there, was, a, popular, view, of, socrates, as, a, sophist, he, was, among, the, targets, which, prompted, a, vigorous, condemnation, from, his, followers, including, plato, and, xenophon, for, example, in, the, comic, play, the, clouds, aristophanes, criticizes, the, sophists, as, hairsplitting, wordsmiths, and, makes, socrates, their, representative, such, criticism, coupled, with, the, wealth, garnered, by, many, sophist, practitioners, eventually, led, to, popular, resentment, against, sophists, and, the, ideas, and, writings, associated, with, sophism, the, comic, playwright, aristophanes, a, contemporary, of, the, sophists, criticized, the, sophists, as, hairsplitting, wordsmiths, aristophanes, however, made, no, distinction, between, sophists, and, philosophers, and, showed, either, of, them, as, willing, to, argue, any, position, for, the, right, fee, in, aristophanes, s, comedic, play, the, clouds, strepsiades, seeks, the, help, of, socrates, a, parody, of, the, actual, philosopher, in, an, effort, to, avoid, paying, his, debts, in, the, play, socrates, promises, to, teach, strepsiades, son, to, argue, his, way, out, of, paying, his, debts, an, ongoing, debate, is, centered, on, the, difference, between, the, sophists, who, charged, for, their, services, and, socrates, who, did, not, instead, of, giving, instruction, socrates, professed, a, self, effacing, and, questioning, posture, exemplified, by, what, is, known, as, the, socratic, method, although, diogenes, la, rtius, wrote, that, protagoras, a, sophist, invented, this, method, socrates, attitude, towards, the, sophists, was, not, entirely, oppositional, in, one, dialogue, socrates, even, stated, that, the, sophists, were, better, educators, than, he, was, which, he, validated, by, sending, one, of, his, students, to, study, under, a, sophist, w, k, c, guthrie, classified, socrates, as, a, sophist, in, his, history, of, greek, philosophy, one, of, the, few, speeches, that, have, survived, from, ancient, greece, is, isocrates, against, the, sophists, the, speech, offers, scathing, criticisms, against, sophist, teachers, and, their, failures, while, a, sophist, himself, isocrates, sought, to, distinguish, his, school, s, pedagogical, focus, from, other, sophistic, teachings, in, particular, isocrates, wanted, to, establish, an, institution, that, educated, athenian, students, in, a, manner, that, would, promote, the, success, of, athenian, democracy, by, developing, a, school, in, athens, around, 392, bce, approximately, five, years, after, plato, opened, his, platonic, academy, isocrates, gave, sophism, more, credibility, in, society, as, only, small, portions, of, the, sophists, writings, have, survived, they, are, mainly, known, through, the, works, of, plato, plato, s, dialogs, present, his, generally, hostile, views, on, the, sophists, thought, due, to, which, he, is, largely, responsible, for, the, modern, view, of, the, sophist, as, an, avaricious, instructor, who, teaches, deception, before, plato, the, word, sophist, could, be, used, as, either, a, respectful, or, contemptuous, title, it, was, in, plato, s, dialogue, sophist, that, the, first, record, of, an, attempt, to, answer, the, question, what, is, a, sophist, is, made, plato, described, sophists, as, paid, hunters, after, the, young, and, wealthy, as, merchants, of, knowledge, as, athletes, in, a, contest, of, words, and, purgers, of, souls, from, plato, s, assessment, of, sophists, it, could, be, concluded, that, sophists, do, not, offer, true, knowledge, but, only, an, opinion, of, things, plato, describes, them, as, shadows, of, the, true, saying, the, art, of, contradiction, making, descended, from, an, insincere, kind, of, conceited, mimicry, of, the, semblance, making, breed, derived, from, image, making, distinguished, as, portion, not, divine, but, human, of, production, that, presents, a, shadow, play, of, words, such, are, the, blood, and, the, lineage, which, can, with, perfect, truth, be, assigned, to, the, authentic, sophist, plato, sought, to, distinguish, sophists, from, philosophers, arguing, that, a, sophist, was, a, person, who, made, his, living, through, deception, whereas, a, philosopher, was, a, lover, of, wisdom, who, sought, the, truth, to, give, the, philosophers, greater, credence, plato, gave, the, sophists, a, negative, connotation, plato, depicts, socrates, as, refuting, sophists, in, several, dialogues, these, texts, often, depict, the, sophists, in, an, unflattering, light, and, it, is, unclear, how, accurate, or, fair, plato, s, representation, of, them, may, be, however, protagoras, and, prodicus, are, portrayed, in, a, largely, positive, light, in, protagoras, protagoras, argued, that, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, meaning, man, decides, for, himself, what, he, is, going, to, believe, the, works, of, plato, and, aristotle, have, had, much, influence, on, the, modern, view, of, the, sophist, as, a, greedy, instructor, who, uses, rhetorical, sleight, of, hand, and, ambiguities, of, language, in, order, to, deceive, or, to, support, fallacious, reasoning, in, this, view, the, sophist, is, not, concerned, with, truth, and, justice, but, instead, seeks, power, some, scholars, such, as, ugo, zilioli, argue, that, the, sophists, held, a, relativistic, view, on, cognition, and, knowledge, however, this, may, involve, the, greek, word, doxa, which, means, culturally, shared, belief, rather, than, individual, opinion, the, sophists, philosophy, contains, criticisms, of, religion, law, and, ethics, although, many, sophists, were, apparently, as, religious, as, their, contemporaries, some, held, atheistic, or, agnostic, views, for, example, protagoras, and, diagoras, of, melos, few, writings, from, and, about, the, first, sophists, survive, the, early, sophists, charged, money, in, exchange, for, education, and, providing, wisdom, and, so, were, typically, employed, by, wealthy, people, this, practice, resulted, in, the, condemnations, made, by, plato, through, socrates, in, his, dialogues, as, well, as, by, xenophon, in, his, memorabilia, and, somewhat, controversially, by, aristotle, as, a, paid, tutor, to, alexander, the, great, aristotle, could, be, accused, of, being, a, sophist, aristotle, did, not, actually, accept, payment, from, philip, alexander, s, father, but, requested, that, philip, reconstruct, aristotle, s, home, town, of, stageira, as, payment, which, philip, had, destroyed, in, a, previous, campaign, terms, which, philip, accepted, james, a, herrick, wrote, in, de, oratore, cicero, blames, plato, for, separating, wisdom, and, eloquence, in, the, philosopher, s, famous, attack, on, the, sophists, in, gorgias, through, works, such, as, these, sophists, were, portrayed, as, specious, or, deceptive, hence, the, modern, meaning, of, the, term, the, sophists, rhetorical, techniques, were, useful, for, any, young, nobleman, seeking, public, office, the, societal, roles, the, sophists, filled, had, important, ramifications, for, the, athenian, political, system, the, historical, context, provides, evidence, for, their, considerable, influence, as, athens, became, more, and, more, democratic, during, the, period, in, which, the, sophists, were, most, active, even, though, athens, was, already, a, flourishing, democracy, before, their, arrival, the, cultural, and, psychological, contributions, of, the, sophists, played, an, important, role, in, the, growth, of, athenian, democracy, sophists, contributed, to, the, new, democracy, in, part, by, espousing, expertise, in, public, deliberation, the, foundation, of, decision, making, which, allowed, and, perhaps, required, a, tolerance, of, the, beliefs, of, others, this, liberal, attitude, would, naturally, have, made, its, way, into, the, athenian, assembly, as, sophists, began, acquiring, increasingly, high, powered, clients, continuous, rhetorical, training, gave, the, citizens, of, athens, the, ability, to, create, accounts, of, communal, possibilities, through, persuasive, speech, this, was, important, for, the, democracy, as, it, gave, disparate, and, sometimes, superficially, unattractive, views, a, chance, to, be, heard, in, the, athenian, assembly, in, addition, sophists, had, a, great, impact, on, the, early, development, of, law, as, the, sophists, were, the, first, lawyers, in, the, world, their, status, as, lawyers, was, a, result, of, their, highly, developed, skills, in, argument, the, sophists, were, the, first, formal, teachers, of, the, art, of, speaking, and, writing, in, the, western, world, their, influence, on, education, in, general, and, medical, education, in, particular, has, been, described, by, seamus, mac, suibhne, the, sophists, offer, quite, a, different, epistemic, field, from, that, mapped, by, aristotle, according, to, scholar, susan, jarratt, writer, of, rereading, the, sophists, classical, rhetoric, refigured, for, the, sophists, the, science, of, eloquence, became, a, method, to, earn, money, in, order, to, teach, their, students, the, art, of, persuasion, and, demonstrate, their, thoughts, they, focused, on, two, techniques, dialectics, and, rhetoric, the, sophists, taught, their, students, two, main, techniques, the, usage, of, sophisms, and, contradictions, these, means, distinguished, the, speeches, of, the, sophists, from, the, other, speakers, contradictions, antithesis, were, important, to, the, sophists, because, they, believed, that, a, good, rhetorician, should, be, able, to, defend, both, his, own, opinion, and, the, exact, opposite, one, in, this, way, was, developed, the, ability, to, find, clear, convincing, arguments, for, any, thesis, for, the, sophists, the, primary, purpose, was, to, win, the, dispute, in, order, to, prove, their, excellence, in, word, usage, they, were, convinced, that, there, was, no, verity, but, there, were, different, opinions, equal, in, importance, and, the, verity, was, the, only, one, that, would, be, more, convincingly, demonstrated, by, the, rhetorician, sophists, were, not, limited, in, their, speeches, only, to, topics, in, which, they, were, aware, for, them, there, were, no, topics, they, could, not, dispute, because, their, skill, reached, such, a, level, that, they, were, able, to, talk, about, completely, unknown, things, to, them, and, still, impress, upon, listeners, and, the, opponent, the, main, purpose, was, to, pick, an, approach, to, the, audience, to, please, it, and, to, adapt, the, speech, to, it, unlike, plato, s, approach, the, sophist, rhetoricians, did, not, focus, on, identifying, the, truth, but, the, most, important, thing, for, them, was, to, prove, their, case, the, first, sophist, whose, speeches, are, a, perfect, example, of, a, sophisticated, approach, is, gorgias, one, of, his, most, famous, speeches, is, the, praise, of, helen, which, has, made, a, significant, contribution, to, rhetorical, art, in, this, speech, gorgias, aims, to, make, something, almost, impossible, to, justify, helen, about, whom, the, people, have, already, had, a, negative, opinion, by, methods, of, double, oppositions, stringing, of, repetitive, positive, qualities, and, insightful, consistent, arguments, gorgias, leontynets, gradually, purifies, the, poor, reputation, of, a, woman, later, aristotle, described, the, means, used, in, gorgias, speech, as, gorgias, figures, all, of, these, figures, create, the, most, accessible, path, for, the, audience, to, the, argument, offered, varying, depending, on, the, type, of, speech, and, audience, the, classical, tradition, of, rhetoric, and, composition, refers, more, to, philosophers, such, as, aristotle, cicero, and, quintilian, than, to, the, sophists, owing, largely, to, the, influence, of, plato, and, aristotle, philosophy, came, to, be, regarded, as, distinct, from, sophistry, the, latter, being, regarded, as, specious, and, rhetorical, a, practical, discipline, thus, by, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, a, sophist, was, simply, a, teacher, of, rhetoric, and, a, popular, public, speaker, for, instance, libanius, himerius, aelius, aristides, and, fronto, were, sophists, in, this, sense, however, despite, the, opposition, from, philosophers, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, it, is, clear, that, sophists, had, a, vast, influence, on, a, number, of, spheres, including, the, growth, of, knowledge, and, on, ethical, political, theory, their, teachings, had, a, huge, influence, on, thought, in, the, 5th, century, bce, the, sophists, focused, on, the, rational, examination, of, human, affairs, and, the, betterment, and, success, of, human, life, they, argued, that, gods, could, not, be, the, explanation, of, human, action, many, rhetoricians, during, this, period, were, instructed, under, specialists, in, greek, rhetorical, studies, as, part, of, their, standard, education, cicero, a, prominent, rhetorician, during, this, period, in, roman, history, is, one, such, example, of, the, influence, of, the, second, sophistic, on, roman, education, his, early, life, coincided, with, the, suppression, of, latin, rhetoric, in, roman, education, under, the, edicts, of, crassus, and, domitius, cicero, was, instructed, in, greek, rhetoric, throughout, his, youth, as, well, as, in, other, subjects, of, the, roman, rubric, under, archias, cicero, benefited, in, his, early, education, from, favorable, ties, to, crassus, in, his, writings, cicero, is, said, to, have, shown, a, synthesis, that, he, achieved, between, greek, and, roman, culture, summed, up, in, his, work, de, oratore, despite, his, oratorical, skill, cicero, pressed, for, a, more, liberal, education, in, roman, instruction, which, focused, more, in, the, broad, sciences, including, roman, history, he, entitled, this, set, of, sciences, as, politior, humanitas, 2, 72, regardless, of, his, efforts, toward, this, end, greek, history, was, still, preferred, by, the, majority, of, aristocratic, romans, during, this, time, from, the, late, 1st, century, ce, the, second, sophistic, a, philosophical, and, rhetorical, movement, was, the, chief, expression, of, intellectual, life, the, term, second, sophistic, comes, from, philostratus, who, rejecting, the, term, new, sophistic, traced, the, beginnings, of, the, movement, to, the, orator, aeschines, in, the, 4th, century, bce, but, its, earliest, representative, was, really, nicetes, of, smyrna, in, the, late, 1st,
