a, sphinx, s, f, k, s, sfinks, ancient, greek, pronounced, boeotian, romanized, ph, x, pronounced, pl, sphinxes, or, sphinges, is, a, mythical, creature, with, the, head, of, a, human, the, body, of, a, lion, and, the, wings, of, an, eagle, in, greek, tradition, the, sphinx, is, a, treacherous, and, merciless, being, with, the, head, of, a, woman, the, haunches, of, a, lion, and, the, wings, of, a, bird, according, to, greek, myth, she, challenges, those, who, encounter, her, to, answer, a, riddle, and, kills, and, eats, them, when, they, fail, to, solve, the, riddle, this, deadly, version, of, a, sphinx, appears, in, the, myth, and, drama, of, oedipus, in, egyptian, mythology, in, contrast, the, sphinx, is, typically, depicted, as, a, man, an, androsphinx, ancient, greek, and, is, seen, as, a, benevolent, representation, of, strength, and, ferocity, usually, of, a, pharaoh, unlike, greek, or, levantine, mesopotamian, ones, egyptian, sphinxes, were, not, winged, both, the, greek, and, egyptian, sphinxes, were, thought, of, as, guardians, and, statues, of, them, often, flank, the, entrances, to, temples, during, the, renaissance, the, sphinx, enjoyed, a, major, revival, in, european, decorative, art, during, this, period, images, of, the, sphinx, were, initially, similar, to, the, ancient, egyptian, version, but, when, later, exported, to, other, cultures, the, sphinx, was, often, conceived, of, quite, differently, partly, due, to, varied, translations, of, descriptions, of, the, originals, and, partly, through, the, evolution, of, the, concept, as, it, was, integrated, into, other, cultural, traditions, however, depictions, of, the, sphinx, are, generally, associated, with, grand, architectural, structures, such, as, royal, tombs, or, religious, temples, the, word, sphinx, comes, from, the, greek, associated, by, folk, etymology, with, the, verb, sph, ng, meaning, to, squeeze, to, tighten, up, this, name, may, be, derived, from, the, fact, that, lions, kill, their, prey, by, strangulation, biting, the, throat, of, prey, and, holding, them, down, until, they, die, however, the, historian, susan, wise, bauer, suggests, that, the, word, sphinx, was, instead, a, greek, corruption, of, the, egyptian, name, shesepankh, which, meant, living, image, and, referred, rather, to, the, statue, of, the, sphinx, which, was, carved, out, of, living, rock, rock, that, was, a, contiguous, part, of, the, stony, body, of, the, earth, shaped, but, not, cut, away, from, its, original, source, than, to, the, beast, itself, the, largest, and, most, famous, sphinx, is, the, great, sphinx, of, giza, situated, on, the, giza, plateau, adjacent, to, the, great, pyramids, of, giza, on, the, west, bank, of, the, nile, river, and, facing, east, 29, 58,

the, general, consensus, among, egyptologists, is, that, the, head, of, the, great, sphinx, bears, the, likeness, of, the, pharaoh, khafre, dating, it, to, between, 2600, and, 2500, bc, however, a, fringe, minority, of, late, 20th, century, geologists, have, claimed, evidence, of, water, erosion, in, and, around, the, sphinx, enclosure, which, would, prove, that, the, sphinx, predates, khafre, at, around, 10, 000, to, 5000, bc, a, claim, that, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, sphinx, water, erosion, hypothesis, but, which, has, little, support, among, egyptologists, and, contradicts, other, evidence, what, names, their, builders, gave, to, these, statues, is, unknown, at, the, great, sphinx, site, a, 1400, bc, inscription, on, a, stele, belonging, to, the, 18th, dynasty, pharaoh, thutmose, iv, lists, the, names, of, three, aspects, of, the, local, sun, deity, of, that, period, khepera, r, atum, many, pharaohs, had, their, heads, carved, atop, the, guardian, statues, for, their, tombs, to, show, their, close, relationship, with, the, powerful, solar, deity, sekhmet, a, lioness, besides, the, great, sphinx, other, famous, egyptian, sphinxes, include, one, bearing, the, head, of, the, pharaoh, hatshepsut, with, her, likeness, carved, in, granite, which, is, now, in, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, in, new, york, and, the, alabaster, sphinx, of, memphis, currently, located, within, the, open, air, museum, at, that, site, the, theme, was, expanded, to, form, great, avenues, of, guardian, sphinxes, lining, the, approaches, to, tombs, and, temples, as, well, as, serving, as, details, atop, the, posts, of, flights, of, stairs, to, very, grand, complexes, nine, hundred, sphinxes, with, ram, heads, criosphinxes, believed, to, represent, amon, were, built, in, thebes, where, his, cult, was, strongest, at, karnak, each, criosphinx, is, fronted, by, a, full, length, statue, of, the, pharaoh, the, task, of, these, sphinxes, was, to, hold, back, the, forces, of, evil, the, great, sphinx, has, become, an, emblem, of, egypt, frequently, appearing, on, its, stamps, coins, and, official, documents, in, march, 2023, a, limestone, sphinx, was, discovered, at, the, dendera, temple, complex, this, sphinx, which, is, depicted, with, a, slight, grin, and, dimples, is, thought, to, be, made, in, the, image, of, the, roman, emperor, claudius, the, revived, mannerist, sphinx, of, the, late, 15th, century, is, sometimes, thought, of, as, the, french, sphinx, her, coiffed, head, is, erect, and, she, has, the, breasts, of, a, young, woman,

decorations, of, the, unearthed, domus, aurea, of, nero, were, brought, to, light, in, late, 15th, century, rome, and, she, was, incorporated, into, the, classical, vocabulary, of, arabesque, designs, that, spread, throughout, europe, in, engravings, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, sphinxes, were, included, in, the, decoration, of, the, loggia, of, the, vatican, palace, by, the, workshop, of, raphael, 1515, 20, which, updated, the, vocabulary, of, the, roman, grottesche, the, first, appearances, of, sphinxes, in, french, art, are, in, the, school, of, fontainebleau, in, the, 1520s, and, 1530s, and, she, continues, into, the, late, baroque, style, of, the, french, r, gence, 1715, 1723, from, france, she, spread, throughout, europe, becoming, a, regular, feature, of, the,

sphinxes, are, a, feature, of, the, neoclassical, interior, decorations, of, robert, adam, and, his, followers, returning, closer, to, the, undressed, style, of, the, grottesche, they, had, an, equal, appeal, to, artists, and, designers, of, the, romanticism, and, subsequent, symbolism, movements, in, the, 19th, century, most, of, these, sphinxes, alluded, to, the, greek, sphinx, and, the, myth, of, oedipus, rather, than, the, egyptian, although, they, may, not, have, wings, the, decadent, movement, a, european, movement, that, was, attributed, to, the, notion, of, decadence, around, the,

also, be, connected, to, the, motif, of, the, femme, fatale, figure, in, decadent, texts, in, which, a, typically, female, like, figure, or, beast, seduces, and, murders, men, the, femme, fatale, is,

that, the, sphinx, represented, just, an, idea, oscar, wilde, a, known, decadent, writer, utilized, this, motif, in, his, poem, the, sphinx, the, poem, itself, establishes, a, connection, between, the, sphinx, and, the, french, due, to, underlying, social, decline, such, as, the, french, empire, collapsing, wilde, describes, the, sphinx, as, a, sort, of, half, cat, and, half, woman, that, is, connected, to, many, mythological, events, typically, that, of, egypt, and, greece, as, well, as, how, the, mysterious, creature, is, surrounded, by, lust, and, death, the, writer, james, thomson,

time, that, alexander, the, great, occupied, egypt, the, greek, name, sphinx, was, already, applied, to, these, statues, the, historians, and, geographers, of, greece, such, as, herodotus, wrote,

her, high, rock, and, died, or, in, some, versions, oedipus, killed, her, an, alternative, version, tells, that, she, devoured, herself, in, both, cases, oedipus, can, therefore, be, recognized, as, a, liminal, or, threshold, figure, helping, effect, the, transition, between, the, old, religious, practices, represented, by, the, death, of, the, sphinx, and, the, rise, of, the, new, olympian,
