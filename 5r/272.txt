attributes, of, such, a, god, were, transmitted, to, the, bodhisattva, but, the, mainstream, of, those, who, venerated, avalokite, vara, upheld, the, buddhist, rejection, of, the, doctrine, of, any,

of, the, crown, identify, n, tha, as, avalokite, vara, andrew, skilton, writes, it, is, clear, from, sculptural, evidence, alone, that, the, mah, y, na, was, fairly, widespread, throughout, sri, lanka, although, the, modern, account, of, the, history, of, buddhism, on, the, island, presents, an, unbroken, and, pure, lineage, of, therav, da, one, can, only, assume, that, similar, trends, were, transmitted, to, other, parts, of, southeast, asia, with, sri, lankan, ordination, lineages, relics, of, an, extensive, cult, of, avalokite, vara, can, be, seen, in, the, present, day, figure, of, n,

gained, popularity, with, the, growth, of, the, abhayagiri, vih, ra, s, tamraparniyan, mahayana, sect, western, scholars, have, not, reached, a, consensus, on, the, origin, of, the, reverence, for, avalokite, vara, some, have, suggested, that, avalokite, vara, along, with, many, other, supernatural, beings, in, buddhism, was, a, borrowing, or, absorption, by, mahayana, buddhism, of, one, or, more, deities, from, hinduism, in, particular, shiva, or, vishnu, this, seems, to, be, based, on, the, name, avalokite, vara, on, the, basis, of, the, study, of, buddhist, scriptures, and, ancient,
