atheism, in, the, broadest, sense, is, an, absence, of, belief, in, the, existence, of, deities, less, broadly, atheism, is, a, rejection, of, the, belief, that, any, deities, exist, in, an, even, narrower, sense, atheism, is, specifically, the, position, that, there, are, no, deities, atheism, is, contrasted, with, theism, which, in, its, most, general, form, is, the, belief, that, at, least, one, deity, exists, historically, evidence, of, atheistic, viewpoints, can, be, traced, back, to, classical, antiquity, and, early, indian, philosophy, in, the, western, world, atheism, declined, as, christianity, gained, prominence, the, 16th, century, and, the, age, of, enlightenment, marked, the, resurgence, of, atheistic, thought, in, europe, atheism, achieved, a, significant, position, in, the, 20th, century, with, legislation, protecting, freedom, of, thought, broad, estimates, of, those, who, have, an, absence, of, belief, in, a, god, range, from, 500, million, to, 1, 1, billion, people, worldwide, atheist, organizations, have, defended, the, autonomy, of, science, secular, ethics, and, secularism, arguments, for, atheism, range, from, philosophical, to, social, and, historical, approaches, rationales, for, not, believing, in, deities, include, the, lack, of, evidence, the, problem, of, evil, the, argument, from, inconsistent, revelations, the, rejection, of, concepts, that, cannot, be, falsified, and, the, argument, from, nonbelief, nonbelievers, contend, that, atheism, is, a, more, parsimonious, position, than, theism, and, that, everyone, is, born, without, beliefs, in, deities, therefore, they, argue, that, the, burden, of, proof, lies, not, on, the, atheist, to, disprove, the, existence, of, gods, but, on, the, theist, to, provide, a, rationale, for, theism, writers, disagree, on, how, best, to, define, and, classify, atheism, contesting, what, supernatural, entities, are, considered, gods, whether, atheism, is, a, philosophical, position, or, merely, the, absence, of, one, and, whether, it, requires, a, conscious, explicit, rejection, however, the, norm, is, to, define, atheism, in, terms, of, an, explicit, stance, against, theism, atheism, has, been, regarded, as, compatible, with, agnosticism, but, has, also, been, contrasted, with, it, some, of, the, ambiguity, involved, in, defining, atheism, arises, from, the, definitions, of, words, like, deity, and, god, the, variety, of, wildly, different, conceptions, of, god, and, deities, lead, to, differing, ideas, regarding, atheism, s, applicability, the, ancient, romans, accused, christians, of, being, atheists, for, not, worshiping, the, pagan, deities, gradually, this, view, fell, into, disfavor, as, theism, came, to, be, understood, as, encompassing, belief, in, any, divinity, with, respect, to, the, range, of, phenomena, being, rejected, atheism, may, counter, anything, from, the, existence, of, a, deity, to, the, existence, of, any, spiritual, supernatural, or, transcendental, concepts, definitions, of, atheism, also, vary, in, the, degree, of, consideration, a, person, must, put, to, the, idea, of, gods, to, be, considered, an, atheist, atheism, has, been, defined, as, the, absence, of, belief, that, any, deities, exist, this, broad, definition, would, include, newborns, and, other, people, who, have, not, been, exposed, to, theistic, ideas, as, far, back, as, 1772, baron, d, holbach, said, that, all, children, are, born, atheists, they, have, no, idea, of, god, similarly, george, h, smith, suggested, that, the, man, who, is, unacquainted, with, theism, is, an, atheist, because, he, does, not, believe, in, a, god, this, category, would, also, include, the, child, with, the, conceptual, capacity, to, grasp, the, issues, involved, but, who, is, still, unaware, of, those, issues, the, fact, that, this, child, does, not, believe, in, god, qualifies, him, as, an, atheist, implicit, atheism, is, the, absence, of, theistic, belief, without, a, conscious, rejection, of, it, and, explicit, atheism, is, the, conscious, rejection, of, belief, it, is, usual, to, define, atheism, in, terms, of, an, explicit, stance, against, theism, for, the, purposes, of, his, paper, on, philosophical, atheism, ernest, nagel, contested, including, the, mere, absence, of, theistic, belief, as, a, type, of, atheism, graham, oppy, classifies, as, innocents, those, who, never, considered, the, question, because, they, lack, any, understanding, of, what, a, god, is, for, example, one, month, old, babies, philosophers, such, as, antony, flew, and, michael, martin, have, contrasted, positive, strong, hard, atheism, with, negative, weak, soft, atheism, positive, atheism, is, the, explicit, affirmation, that, gods, do, not, exist, negative, atheism, includes, all, other, forms, of, non, theism, according, to, this, categorization, anyone, who, is, not, a, theist, is, either, a, negative, or, a, positive, atheist, michael, martin, for, example, asserts, that, agnosticism, entails, negative, atheism, agnostic, atheism, encompasses, both, atheism, and, agnosticism, however, many, agnostics, see, their, view, as, distinct, from, atheism, according, to, atheists, arguments, unproven, religious, propositions, deserve, as, much, disbelief, as, all, other, unproven, propositions, atheist, criticism, of, agnosticism, says, that, the, unprovability, of, a, god, s, existence, does, not, imply, an, equal, probability, of, either, possibility, australian, philosopher, j, j, c, smart, argues, that, sometimes, a, person, who, is, really, an, atheist, may, describe, herself, even, passionately, as, an, agnostic, because, of, unreasonable, generalized, philosophical, skepticism, which, would, preclude, us, from, saying, that, we, know, anything, whatever, except, perhaps, the, truths, of, mathematics, and, formal, logic, consequently, some, atheist, authors, such, as, richard, dawkins, prefer, distinguishing, theist, agnostic, and, atheist, positions, along, a, spectrum, of, theistic, probability, the, likelihood, that, each, assigns, to, the, statement, god, exists, before, the, 18th, century, the, existence, of, god, was, so, accepted, in, the, western, world, that, even, the, possibility, of, true, atheism, was, questioned, this, is, called, theistic, innatism, the, notion, that, all, people, believe, in, god, from, birth, within, this, view, was, the, connotation, that, atheists, are, in, denial, some, atheists, have, challenged, the, need, for, the, term, atheism, in, his, book, letter, to, a, christian, nation, sam, harris, wrote, in, fact, atheism, is, a, term, that, should, not, even, exist, no, one, ever, needs, to, identify, himself, as, a, non, astrologer, or, a, non, alchemist, we, do, not, have, words, for, people, who, doubt, that, elvis, is, still, alive, or, that, aliens, have, traversed, the, galaxy, only, to, molest, ranchers, and, their, cattle, atheism, is, nothing, more, than, the, noises, reasonable, people, make, in, the, presence, of, unjustified, religious, beliefs, in, early, ancient, greek, the, adjective, theos, from, the, privative, god, meant, godless, it, was, first, used, as, a, term, of, censure, roughly, meaning, ungodly, or, impious, in, the, 5th, century, bce, the, word, began, to, indicate, more, deliberate, and, active, godlessness, in, the, sense, of, severing, relations, with, the, gods, or, denying, the, gods, the, term, aseb, s, then, came, to, be, applied, against, those, who, impiously, denied, or, disrespected, the, local, gods, even, if, they, believed, in, other, gods, modern, translations, of, classical, texts, sometimes, render, theos, as, atheistic, as, an, abstract, noun, there, was, also, atheot, s, atheism, cicero, transliterated, the, greek, word, into, the, latin, theos, the, term, found, frequent, use, in, the, debate, between, early, christians, and, hellenists, with, each, side, attributing, it, in, the, pejorative, sense, to, the, other, the, term, atheist, from, the, french, ath, e, in, the, sense, of, one, who, denies, the, existence, of, god, or, gods, predates, atheism, in, english, being, first, found, as, early, as, 1566, and, again, in, 1571, atheist, as, a, label, of, practical, godlessness, was, used, at, least, as, early, as, 1577, the, term, atheism, was, derived, from, the, french, ath, isme, and, appears, in, english, about, 1587, atheism, was, first, used, to, describe, a, self, avowed, belief, in, late, 18th, century, europe, specifically, denoting, disbelief, in, the, monotheistic, abrahamic, god, in, the, 20th, century, globalization, contributed, to, the, expansion, of, the, term, to, refer, to, disbelief, in, all, deities, though, it, remains, common, in, western, society, to, describe, atheism, as, disbelief, in, god, skepticism, based, on, the, ideas, of, david, hume, asserts, that, certainty, about, anything, is, impossible, so, one, can, never, know, for, sure, whether, or, not, a, god, exists, hume, however, held, that, such, unobservable, metaphysical, concepts, should, be, rejected, as, sophistry, and, illusion, michael, martin, argues, that, atheism, is, a, justified, and, rational, true, belief, but, offers, no, extended, epistemological, justification, because, current, theories, are, in, a, state, of, controversy, martin, instead, argues, for, mid, level, principles, of, justification, that, are, in, accord, with, our, ordinary, and, scientific, rational, practice, other, arguments, for, atheism, that, can, be, classified, as, epistemological, or, ontological, assert, the, meaninglessness, or, unintelligibility, of, basic, terms, such, as, god, and, statements, such, as, god, is, all, powerful, theological, noncognitivism, holds, that, the, statement, god, exists, does, not, express, a, proposition, but, is, nonsensical, or, cognitively, meaningless, it, has, been, argued, both, ways, as, to, whether, such, individuals, can, be, classified, into, some, form, of, atheism, or, agnosticism, philosophers, a, j, ayer, and, theodore, m, drange, reject, both, categories, stating, that, both, camps, accept, god, exists, as, a, proposition, they, instead, place, noncognitivism, in, its, own, category, most, atheists, lean, toward, ontological, monism, the, belief, that, there, is, only, one, kind, of, fundamental, substance, the, philosophical, materialism, is, a, view, that, matter, is, the, fundamental, substance, in, nature, this, omits, the, possibility, of, a, non, material, divine, being, according, to, physicalism, only, physical, entities, exist, philosophies, opposed, to, the, materialism, or, physicalism, include, idealism, dualism, and, other, forms, of, monism, naturalism, is, also, used, to, describe, the, view, that, everything, that, exists, is, fundamentally, natural, and, that, there, are, no, supernatural, phenomena, according, to, naturalist, view, science, can, explain, the, world, with, physical, laws, and, through, natural, phenomena, philosopher, graham, oppy, references, a, philpapers, survey, that, says, 56, 5, of, philosophers, in, academics, lean, toward, physicalism, 49, 8, lean, toward, naturalism, according, to, graham, oppy, direct, arguments, for, atheism, aim, at, showing, theism, fails, on, its, own, terms, while, indirect, arguments, are, those, inferred, from, direct, arguments, in, favor, of, something, else, that, is, inconsistent, with, theism, for, example, oppy, says, arguing, for, naturalism, is, an, argument, for, atheism, since, naturalism, and, theism, cannot, both, be, true, 53, fiona, ellis, describes, the, expansive, naturalism, of, john, mcdowell, james, griffin, and, david, wiggins, while, also, asserting, there, are, things, in, human, experience, which, cannot, be, explained, in, such, terms, such, as, the, concept, of, value, leaving, room, for, theism, christopher, c, knight, asserts, a, theistic, naturalism, nevertheless, oppy, argues, that, a, strong, naturalism, favors, atheism, though, he, finds, the, best, direct, arguments, against, theism, to, be, the, evidential, problem, of, evil, and, arguments, concerning, the, contradictory, nature, of, god, were, one, to, exist, 55, 60, some, atheists, hold, the, view, that, the, various, conceptions, of, gods, such, as, the, personal, god, of, christianity, are, ascribed, logically, inconsistent, qualities, such, atheists, present, deductive, arguments, against, the, existence, of, god, which, assert, the, incompatibility, between, certain, traits, such, as, perfection, creator, status, immutability, omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, omnibenevolence, transcendence, personhood, a, personal, being, non, physicality, justice, and, mercy, theodicean, atheists, believe, that, the, world, as, they, experience, it, cannot, be, reconciled, with, the, qualities, commonly, ascribed, to, god, and, gods, by, theologians, they, argue, that, an, omniscient, omnipotent, and, omnibenevolent, god, is, not, compatible, with, a, world, where, there, is, evil, and, suffering, and, where, divine, love, is, hidden, from, many, people, epicurus, is, credited, with, first, expounding, the, problem, of, evil, david, hume, in, his, dialogues, concerning, natural, religion, 1779, cited, epicurus, in, stating, the, argument, as, a, series, of, questions, is, god, willing, to, prevent, evil, but, not, able, then, he, is, impotent, is, he, able, but, not, willing, then, he, is, malevolent, is, he, both, able, and, willing, then, whence, cometh, evil, is, he, neither, able, nor, willing, then, why, call, him, god, similar, arguments, have, been, made, in, buddhist, philosophy, vasubandhu, 4th, 5th, century, outlined, numerous, buddhist, arguments, against, god, philosopher, ludwig, feuerbach, and, psychoanalyst, sigmund, freud, have, argued, that, god, and, other, religious, beliefs, are, human, inventions, created, to, fulfill, various, psychological, and, emotional, wants, or, needs, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, influenced, by, the, work, of, feuerbach, argued, that, belief, in, god, and, religion, are, social, functions, used, by, those, in, power, to, oppress, the, working, class, according, to, mikhail, bakunin, the, idea, of, god, implies, the, abdication, of, human, reason, and, justice, it, is, the, most, decisive, negation, of, human, liberty, and, necessarily, ends, in, the, enslavement, of, mankind, in, theory, and, practice, he, reversed, voltaire, s, aphorism, that, if, god, did, not, exist, it, would, be, necessary, to, invent, him, writing, instead, that, if, god, really, existed, it, would, be, necessary, to, abolish, him, sociologist, phil, zuckerman, analyzed, previous, social, science, research, on, secularity, and, non, belief, and, concluded, that, societal, well, being, is, positively, correlated, with, irreligion, he, found, that, there, are, much, lower, concentrations, of, atheism, and, secularity, in, poorer, less, developed, nations, particularly, in, africa, and, south, america, than, in, the, richer, industrialized, democracies, his, findings, relating, specifically, to, atheism, in, the, us, were, that, compared, to, religious, people, in, the, us, atheists, and, secular, people, are, less, nationalistic, prejudiced, antisemitic, racist, dogmatic, ethnocentric, closed, minded, and, authoritarian, and, in, us, states, with, the, highest, percentages, of, atheists, the, murder, rate, is, lower, than, average, in, the, most, religious, states, the, murder, rate, is, higher, than, average, joseph, baker, and, buster, smith, assert, that, one, of, the, common, themes, of, atheism, is, that, most, atheists, typically, construe, atheism, as, more, moral, than, religion, one, of, the, most, common, criticisms, of, atheism, has, been, to, the, contrary, that, denying, the, existence, of, a, god, either, leads, to, moral, relativism, and, leaves, one, with, no, moral, or, ethical, foundation, or, renders, life, meaningless, and, miserable, blaise, pascal, argued, this, view, in, his, pens, es, there, is, also, a, position, claiming, that, atheists, are, quick, to, believe, in, god, in, times, of, crisis, that, atheists, make, deathbed, conversions, or, that, there, are, no, atheists, in, foxholes, there, have, however, been, examples, to, the, contrary, among, them, examples, of, literal, atheists, in, foxholes, there, exist, normative, ethical, systems, that, do, not, require, principles, and, rules, to, be, given, by, a, deity, according, to, plato, s, euthyphro, dilemma, the, role, of, the, gods, in, determining, right, from, wrong, is, either, unnecessary, or, arbitrary, the, argument, that, morality, must, be, derived, from, god, and, cannot, exist, without, a, wise, creator, has, been, a, persistent, feature, of, political, if, not, so, much, philosophical, debate, moral, precepts, such, as, murder, is, wrong, are, seen, as, divine, laws, requiring, a, divine, lawmaker, and, judge, however, many, atheists, argue, that, treating, morality, legalistically, involves, a, false, analogy, and, that, morality, does, not, depend, on, a, lawmaker, in, the, same, way, that, laws, do, philosophers, susan, neiman, and, julian, baggini, among, others, assert, that, behaving, ethically, only, because, of, a, divine, mandate, is, not, true, ethical, behavior, but, merely, blind, obedience, baggini, argues, that, atheism, is, a, superior, basis, for, ethics, claiming, that, a, moral, basis, external, to, religious, imperatives, is, necessary, to, evaluate, the, morality, of, the, imperatives, themselves, to, be, able, to, discern, for, example, that, thou, shalt, steal, is, immoral, even, if, one, s, religion, instructs, it, and, that, atheists, therefore, have, the, advantage, of, being, more, inclined, to, make, such, evaluations, some, prominent, atheists, most, recently, christopher, hitchens, daniel, dennett, sam, harris, and, richard, dawkins, and, following, such, thinkers, as, bertrand, russell, robert, g, ingersoll, voltaire, and, novelist, jos, saramago, have, criticized, religions, citing, harmful, aspects, of, religious, practices, and, doctrines, the, 19th, century, german, political, theorist, and, sociologist, karl, marx, called, religion, the, sigh, of, the, oppressed, creature, the, heart, of, a, heartless, world, and, the, soul, of, soulless, conditions, it, is, the, opium, of, the, people, he, goes, on, to, say, the, abolition, of, religion, as, the, illusory, happiness, of, the, people, is, the, demand, for, their, real, happiness, to, call, on, them, to, give, up, their, illusions, about, their, condition, is, to, call, on, them, to, give, up, a, condition, that, requires, illusions, the, criticism, of, religion, is, therefore, in, embryo, the, criticism, of, that, vale, of, tears, of, which, religion, is, the, halo, sam, harris, criticizes, western, religion, s, reliance, on, divine, authority, as, lending, itself, to, authoritarianism, and, dogmatism, multiple, studies, have, discovered, there, to, be, a, correlation, between, religious, fundamentalism, and, extrinsic, religion, when, religion, is, held, because, it, serves, ulterior, interests, and, authoritarianism, dogmatism, and, prejudice, these, arguments, combined, with, historical, events, that, are, argued, to, demonstrate, the, dangers, of, religion, such, as, the, crusades, inquisitions, witch, trials, and, terrorist, attacks, have, been, used, in, response, to, claims, of, beneficial, effects, of, belief, in, religion, believers, counter, argue, that, some, regimes, that, espouse, atheism, such, as, the, soviet, union, have, also, been, guilty, of, mass, murder, in, response, to, those, claims, atheists, such, as, sam, harris, and, richard, dawkins, have, stated, that, stalin, s, atrocities, were, influenced, not, by, atheism, but, by, dogmatic, ideology, and, that, while, stalin, and, mao, happened, to, be, atheists, they, did, not, do, their, deeds, in, the, name, of, atheism, people, who, self, identify, as, atheists, are, often, assumed, to, be, irreligious, but, some, sects, within, major, religions, reject, the, existence, of, a, personal, creator, deity, it, has, been, said, that, atheism, is, not, mutually, exclusive, with, respect, to, some, religious, and, spiritual, belief, systems, including, modern, neopagan, movements, in, recent, years, certain, religious, denominations, have, accumulated, a, number, of, openly, atheistic, followers, such, as, atheistic, or, humanistic, judaism, and, christian, atheists, atheism, is, accepted, as, a, valid, philosophical, position, within, some, varieties, of, hinduism, jainism, and, buddhism, ideas, that, would, be, recognized, today, as, atheistic, are, documented, from, the, vedic, period, and, the, classical, antiquity, atheistic, schools, are, found, in, early, indian, thought, and, have, existed, from, the, times, of, the, historical, vedic, religion, among, the, six, orthodox, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, samkhya, the, oldest, philosophical, school, of, thought, does, not, accept, god, and, the, early, mimamsa, also, rejected, the, notion, of, god, the, thoroughly, materialistic, and, anti, theistic, philosophical, ch, rv, ka, or, lok, yata, school, that, originated, in, india, around, the, 6th, century, bce, is, probably, the, most, explicitly, atheistic, school, of, philosophy, in, india, similar, to, the, greek, cyrenaic, school, this, branch, of, indian, philosophy, is, classified, as, heterodox, due, to, its, rejection, of, the, authority, of, vedas, and, hence, is, not, considered, part, of, the, six, orthodox, schools, of, indian, philosophy, it, is, noteworthy, as, evidence, of, a, materialistic, movement, in, ancient, india, satischandra, chatterjee, and, dhirendramohan, datta, explain, in, an, introduction, to, indian, philosophy, that, our, understanding, of, ch, rv, ka, philosophy, is, fragmentary, based, largely, on, criticism, of, the, ideas, by, other, schools, though, materialism, in, some, form, or, other, has, always, been, present, in, india, and, occasional, references, are, found, in, the, vedas, the, buddhistic, literature, the, epics, as, well, as, in, the, later, philosophical, works, we, do, not, find, any, systematic, work, on, materialism, nor, any, organized, school, of, followers, as, the, other, philosophical, schools, possess, but, almost, every, work, of, the, other, schools, states, for, refutation, the, materialistic, views, our, knowledge, of, indian, materialism, is, chiefly, based, on, these, other, indian, philosophies, generally, regarded, as, atheistic, include, classical, samkhya, and, purva, mimamsa, the, rejection, of, a, personal, creator, god, is, also, seen, in, jainism, and, buddhism, in, india, western, atheism, has, its, roots, in, pre, socratic, greek, philosophy, but, atheism, in, the, modern, sense, was, extremely, rare, in, ancient, greece, pre, socratic, atomists, such, as, democritus, attempted, to, explain, the, world, in, a, purely, materialistic, way, and, interpreted, religion, as, a, human, reaction, to, natural, phenomena, but, did, not, explicitly, deny, the, gods, existence, anaxagoras, whom, irenaeus, calls, the, atheist, was, accused, of, impiety, and, condemned, for, stating, that, the, sun, is, a, type, of, incandescent, stone, an, affirmation, with, which, he, tried, to, deny, the, divinity, of, the, celestial, bodies, in, the, late, fifth, century, bce, the, greek, lyric, poet, diagoras, of, melos, was, sentenced, to, death, in, athens, under, the, charge, of, being, a, godless, person, after, he, made, fun, of, the, eleusinian, mysteries, but, he, fled, the, city, to, escape, punishment, in, post, classical, antiquity, philosophers, such, as, cicero, and, sextus, empiricus, described, diagoras, as, an, atheist, who, categorically, denied, the, existence, of, the, gods, but, in, modern, scholarship, marek, winiarczyk, has, defended, the, view, that, diagoras, was, not, an, atheist, in, the, modern, sense, in, a, view, that, has, proved, influential, on, the, other, hand, the, verdict, has, been, challenged, by, tim, whitmarsh, who, argues, that, diagoras, rejected, the, gods, on, the, basis, of, the, problem, of, evil, and, this, argument, was, in, turn, alluded, to, in, euripides, fragmentary, play, bellerophon, a, fragment, from, a, lost, attic, drama, that, featured, sisyphus, which, has, been, attributed, to, both, critias, and, euripides, claims, that, a, clever, man, invented, the, fear, of, the, gods, in, order, to, frighten, people, into, behaving, morally, does, then, anyone, say, there, are, gods, in, heaven, there, are, not, there, are, not, if, a, man, is, willing, not, to, give, foolish, credence, to, the, ancient, story, consider, for, yourselves, don, t, form, an, opinion, on, the, basis, of, my, words, protagoras, has, sometimes, been, taken, to, be, an, atheist, but, rather, espoused, agnostic, views, commenting, that, concerning, the, gods, i, am, unable, to, discover, whether, they, exist, or, not, or, what, they, are, like, in, form, for, there, are, many, hindrances, to, knowledge, the, obscurity, of, the, subject, and, the, brevity, of, human, life, the, athenian, public, associated, socrates, c, 470, 399, bce, with, the, trends, in, pre, socratic, philosophy, towards, naturalistic, inquiry, and, the, rejection, of, divine, explanations, for, phenomena, aristophanes, comic, play, the, clouds, performed, 423, bce, portrays, socrates, as, teaching, his, students, that, the, traditional, greek, deities, do, not, exist, socrates, was, later, tried, and, executed, under, the, charge, of, not, believing, in, the, gods, of, the, state, and, instead, worshipping, foreign, gods, socrates, himself, vehemently, denied, the, charges, of, atheism, at, his, trial, from, a, survey, of, these, 5th, century, bce, philosophers, david, sedley, has, concluded, that, none, of, them, openly, defended, radical, atheism, but, since, classical, sources, clearly, attest, to, radical, atheist, ideas, athens, probably, had, an, atheist, underground, religious, skepticism, continued, into, the, hellenistic, period, and, from, this, period, the, most, important, greek, thinker, in, the, development, of, atheism, was, the, philosopher, epicurus, c, 300, bce, drawing, on, the, ideas, of,

intervention, see, scientific, determinism, although, epicurus, still, maintained, that, the, gods, existed, he, believed, that, they, were, uninterested, in, human, affairs, the, aim, of, the, epicureans, was, to, attain, ataraxia, peace, of, mind, and, one, important, way, of, doing, this, was, by, exposing, fear, of, divine, wrath, as, irrational, the, epicureans, also, denied, the,

founders, of, the, past, although, not, strictly, an, atheist, euhemerus, was, later, criticized, by, plutarch, for, having, spread, atheism, over, the, whole, inhabited, earth, by, obliterating, the, gods, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, hellenistic, philosophers, theodorus, cyrenaicus, and, strato, of, lampsacus, were, also, reputed, to, deny, the, existence, of, the, gods, the, pyrrhonist,

for, their, rejection, of, the, roman, gods, in, general, and, the, imperial, cult, of, ancient, rome, in, particular, there, was, however, a, heavy, struggle, between, christians, and, pagans, in, which, each, group, accused, the, other, of, atheism, for, not, practicing, the, religion, which, they, considered, correct, when, christianity, became, the, state, religion, of, rome, under,

arab, and, persian, lands, produced, rationalists, who, were, skeptical, about, revealed, religion, such, as, muhammad, al, warraq, fl, 9th, century, ibn, al, rawandi, 827, 911, and, abu, bakr, al, razi, c, 865, 925, as, well, as, outspoken, atheists, such, as, al, ma, arri, 973, 1058, al, ma, arri, wrote, and, taught, that, religion, itself, was, a, fable, invented, by, the, ancients, and, that, humans, were, of, two, sorts, those, with, brains, but, no, religion, and, those, with, religion, but, no, brains, despite, the, fact, that, these, authors, were, relatively, prolific, writers, little, of, their, work, survives, mainly, being, preserved, through, quotations, and, excerpts, in, later, works, by, muslim, apologists, attempting, to, refute, them, in, europe, the, espousal, of, atheistic, views, was, rare, during, the, early, middle, ages, and, middle, ages, see, medieval, inquisition, there, were, however, movements, within, this, period, that, furthered, heterodox, conceptions, of, the, christian, god, including, differing, views, of, the, nature, transcendence, and, knowability, of, god, william, of, ockham, inspired, anti, metaphysical, tendencies, with, his, nominalist, limitation, of, human, knowledge, to, singular, objects, and, asserted, that, the, divine, essence, could, not, be, intuitively, or, rationally, apprehended, by, human, intellect, sects, deemed, heretical, such, as, the, waldensians, were, also, accused, of, being, atheistic, the, resulting, division, between, faith, and, reason, influenced, later, radical, and, reformist, theologians, the, renaissance, did, much, to, expand, the, scope, of, free, thought, and, skeptical, inquiry, individuals, such, as, leonardo, da, vinci, sought, experimentation, as, a, means, of, explanation, and, opposed, arguments, from, religious, authority, other, critics, of, religion, and, the, church, during, this, time, included, niccol, machiavelli, bonaventure, des, p, riers, michel,

espoused, a, materialist, philosophy, and, skepticism, toward, supernatural, occurrences, by, the, late, 17th, century, deism, came, to, be, openly, espoused, by, intellectuals, the, first, known, explicit, atheist, was, the, german, critic, of, religion, matthias, knutzen, in, his, three, writings, of, 1674, he, was, followed, by, two, other, explicit, atheist, writers, the, polish, ex, jesuit, philosopher, kazimierz, yszczy, ski, who, most, likely, authored, the, world, s, first, treatise, on, the, non, existence, of, god, and, in, the, 1720s, by, the, french, priest, jean, meslier, in, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, other, openly, atheistic, thinkers, followed, such, as, baron, d, holbach, jacques, andr, naigeon, and, other, french, materialists, baron, d, holbach, was, a, prominent, figure, in, the, french, enlightenment, who, is, best, known, for, his, atheism, and, for, his, voluminous, writings, against, religion, the, most, famous, of, them, being, the, system, of,

act, with, a, reasonable, expectation, of, public, punishment, although, voltaire, is, widely, considered, to, have, strongly, contributed, to, atheistic, thinking, during, the, revolution, he, also,

religions, such, as, some, buddhists, the, average, annual, change, for, atheism, from, 2000, to, 2010, was, 0, 17, scholars, have, indicated, that, global, atheism, may, be, in, decline, as, a,

according, to, a, 2014, report, by, the, pew, research, center, 3, 1, of, the, us, adult, population, identify, as, atheist, up, from, 1, 6, in, 2007, and, within, the, religiously, unaffiliated, or, no, religion, demographic, atheists, made, up, 13, 6, according, to, the, 2015, general, sociological, survey, the, number, of, atheists, and, agnostics, in, the, us, has, remained, relatively, flat, in, the, past, 23, years, since, in, 1991, only, 2, identified, as, atheist, and, 4, identified, as, agnostic, and, in, 2014, only, 3, identified, as, atheists, and, 5, identified, as, agnostics,

religiously, unaffiliated, in, recent, years, the, profile, of, atheism, has, risen, substantially, in, the, arab, world, in, major, cities, across, the, region, such, as, cairo, atheists, have, been, organizing, in, caf, s, and, social, media, despite, regular, crackdowns, from, authoritarian, governments, a, 2012, poll, by, gallup, international, revealed, that, 5, of, saudis, considered, themselves, to, be, convinced, atheists, however, very, few, young, people, in, the, arab, world, have, atheists, in, their, circle, of, friends, or, acquaintances, according, to, one, study, less, than, 1, did, in, morocco, egypt, saudi, arabia, or, jordan, only, 3, to, 7, in, the, united, arab, emirates, bahrain, kuwait, and, palestine, when, asked, whether, they, have, seen, or, heard, traces, of, atheism, in, locality, community, and, society, only, about, 3, to, 8, responded, yes, in, all, the, countries, surveyed, the, only, exception, was, the, uae, with, a, percentage, of, 51, statistically, atheists, are, held, in, poor, regard, across, the, globe, non, atheists, seem, to, implicitly, view, atheists, as, prone, to, exhibit, immoral, behaviors, in, addition, according, to, a, 2016, pew, research, center, publication, 15, of, french, people, 45, of, americans, and, 99, of, indonesians, explicitly, believe, that, a, person, must, believe, in, god, to, be, moral, pew, furthermore, noted, that, in, a, u, s, poll, atheists, and, muslims, tied, for, the, lowest, rating, among, the, major, religious, demographics, on, a, feeling, thermometer, also, a, study, of, religious, college, students, found, that, they, were, more, likely, to, perceive, and, interact, with, atheists, negatively, after, considering, their, mortality, suggesting, that, these, attitudes, may, be, the, result, of, death, anxiety, various, studies, have, reported, positive, correlations, between, levels, of, education, wealth, and, iq, with, atheism, according, to, 2024, data, from, pew, research, center, atheists, in, the, united, states, are, more, likely, to, be, white, compared, to, the, general, u, s, population, 77, vs, 62, in, a, 2008, study, researchers, found, intelligence, to, be, negatively, related, to, religious, belief, in, europe, and, the, united, states, in, a, sample, of, 137, countries, the, correlation, between, national, iq, and, disbelief, in, god, was, found, to, be, 0, 60, according, to, evolutionary, psychologist, nigel, barber, atheism, blossoms, in, places, where, most, people, feel, economically, secure, particularly, in, the, social, democracies, of, europe, as, there, is, less, uncertainty, about, the, future, with, extensive, social, safety, nets, and, better, health, care, resulting, in, a, greater, quality, of, life, and, higher, life, expectancy, by, contrast, in, underdeveloped, countries, there, are, far, fewer, atheists, the, relationship, between, atheism, and, iq, while, statistically, significant, is, not, a, large, one, and, the, reason, for, the, relationship, is, not, well, understood, one, hypothesis, is, that, the, negative, relationship, between, iq, and, religiosity, is, mediated, by, individual, differences, in, nonconformity, in, many, countries, religious, belief, is, a, conformist, choice, and, there, is, evidence, that, more, intelligent, people, are, less, likely, to, conform, another, theory, is, that, people, of, higher, iq, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, analytical, reasoning, and, that, disbelief, in, religion, results, from, the, application, of, higher, level, analytical, reasoning, to, the, assessment, of, religious, claims, in, a, 2017, study, it, was, shown, that, compared, to, religious, individuals, atheists, have, higher, reasoning, capacities, and, this, difference, seemed, to, be, unrelated, to, sociodemographic, factors, such, as, age, education, and, country, of, origin, in, a, 2015, study, researchers, found, that, atheists, score, higher, on, cognitive, reflection, tests, than, theists, the, authors, wrote, that, the, fact, that, atheists, score, higher, agrees, with, the, literature, showing, that, belief, is, an, automatic, manifestation, of, the, mind, and, its, default, mode, disbelieving, seems, to, require, deliberative, cognitive, ability, a, 2016, study, in, which, 4, new, studies, were, reported, and, a, meta, analysis, of, all, previous, research, on, the, topic, was, performed, found, that, self, identified, atheists, scored, 18, 7, higher, than, theists, on, the, cognitive, reflection, test, and, there, is, a, negative, correlation, between, religiosity, and, analytical, thinking, the, authors, note, that, recently, it, has, been, argued, that, analytic, thinkers, are, not, actually, less, religious, rather, the, putative, association, may, be, a, result, of, religiosity, typically, being, measured, after, analytic, thinking, an, order, effect, however, they, state, our, results, indicate, that, the, association, between, analytical, thinking, and, religious, disbelief, is, not, caused, by, a, simple, order, effect, there, is, good, evidence, that, atheists, and, agnostics, are, more, reflective, than, religious, believers, this, analytic, atheist, effect, has, also, been, found, among, academic, philosophers, even, when, controlling, for, about, a, dozen, potential, confounds, such, as, education, some, studies, do, not, detect, this, correlation, between, atheism, and, analytic, thinking, in, all, of, the, countries, that, they, study, suggesting, that, the, relationship, between, analytic, thinking, and, atheism, may, depend, on, culture, there, is, also, evidence, that, gender, may, be, involved, in, what, has, been, termed, the, analytic, atheist, effect, because, men, have, been, found, more, likely, to, endorse, atheism, and, men, often, perform, slightly, better, on, tests, of, analytic, thinking, when, not, controlling, for, variables, such, as, math, anxiety, the, correlation, between, atheism, and, analytic, reasoning, may, be, partly, explained, by, whatever, explains, observed, gender, differences, in, analytic, thinking
