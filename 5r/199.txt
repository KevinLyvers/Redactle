a, rabbi, r, b, a, hebrew, romanized, rabb, is, a, spiritual, leader, or, religious, teacher, in, judaism, one, becomes, a, rabbi, by, being, ordained, by, another, rabbi, known, as, semikha, following, a, course, of, study, of, jewish, history, and, texts, such, as, the, talmud, the, basic, form, of, the, rabbi, developed, in, the, pharisaic, 167, bce, 73, ce, and, talmudic, 70, 640, ce, eras, when, learned, teachers, assembled, to, codify, judaism, s, written, and, oral, laws, the, title, rabbi, was, first, used, in, the, first, century, ce, in, more, recent, centuries, the, duties, of, a, rabbi, became, increasingly, influenced, by, the, duties, of, the, protestant, christian, minister, hence, the, title, pulpit, rabbis, and, in, 19th, century, germany, and, the, united, states, rabbinic, activities, including, sermons, pastoral, counseling, and, representing, the, community, to, the, outside, all, increased, in, importance, within, the, various, jewish, denominations, there, are, different, requirements, for, rabbinic, ordination, and, differences, in, opinion, regarding, who, is, recognized, as, a, rabbi, for, example, only, a, minority, of, orthodox, jewish, communities, accept, the, ordination, of, women, rabbis, non, orthodox, movements, i, e, the, conservative, reform, reconstructionist, and, renewal, movements, have, chosen, to, do, so, for, what, they, view, as, halakhic, reasons, conservative, judaism, as, well, as, ethical, reasons, reform, and, reconstructionist, judaism, the, word, comes, from, the, mishnaic, hebrew, construct, r, bb, meaning, master, the, standard, hebrew, noun, is, rav, master, rav, is, also, used, as, a, title, for, rabbis, as, are, rabbeinu, our, master, and, ha, rav, the, master, see, also, rav, and, rebbe, the, hebrew, root, in, turn, derives, from, the, semitic, root, r, b, b, which, in, biblical, aramaic, means, great, in, many, senses, including, revered, but, appears, primarily, as, a, prefix, in, construct, forms, although, the, usage, rabim, many, as, 1, kings, 18, 25, the, majority, the, multitude, occurs, for, the, assembly, of, the, community, in, the, dead, sea, scrolls, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, an, association, of, this, use, with, the, later, title, rabbi, the, root, is, cognate, to, arabic, rabb, meaning, lord, generally, used, when, talking, about, god, but, also, about, temporal, lords, and, to, the, syriac, word, rabi, some, communities, especially, sephardic, and, yemenite, jews, historically, pronounced, the, title, r, bb, this, pronunciation, competed, with, r, bb, and, rabb, in, ashkenaz, until, the, modern, period, rabbi, is, not, an, occupation, found, in, the, hebrew, bible, and, ancient, generations, did, not, employ, related, titles, such, as, rabban, rabbi, or, rav, to, describe, either, the, babylonian, sages, or, the, sages, in, israel, for, example, hillel, i, and, shammai, the, religious, leaders, of, the, early, first, century, had, no, rabbinic, title, prefixed, to, their, names, the, titles, rabban, and, rabbi, are, first, mentioned, in, jewish, literature, in, the, mishnah, rabban, was, first, used, for, rabban, gamaliel, the, elder, rabban, simeon, his, son, and, rabban, yohanan, ben, zakkai, all, of, whom, were, patriarchs, or, presidents, of, the, sanhedrin, in, the, first, century, early, recipients, of, the, title, rabbi, include, rabbi, zadok, and, rabbi, eliezer, ben, jacob, beginning, in, the, time, of, the, disciples, of, rabban, yohanan, ben, zakkai, the, title, rabbi, occurs, in, greek, transliteration, rabbi, in, the, books, of, matthew, mark, and, john, in, the, new, testament, where, it, is, used, in, reference, to, scribes, and, pharisees, as, well, as, to, jesus, according, to, some, the, title, rabbi, or, rabban, was, first, used, after, 70, ce, to, refer, to, yochanan, ben, zakkai, and, his, students, and, references, in, rabbinic, texts, and, the, new, testament, to, rabbis, earlier, in, the, 1st, century, are, anachronisms, or, retroactive, honorifics, other, scholars, believe, that, the, term, rabbi, was, a, well, known, informal, title, by, the, beginning, of, the, first, century, ce, and, thus, that, the, jewish, and, christian, references, to, rabbis, reflect, the, titles, in, fact, used, in, this, period, the, governments, of, the, kingdoms, of, israel, and, judah, were, based, on, a, system, that, included, the, jewish, kings, the, jewish, prophets, the, legal, authority, of, the, high, court, of, jerusalem, the, great, sanhedrin, and, the, ritual, authority, of, the, priesthood, members, of, the, sanhedrin, had, to, receive, their, ordination, semicha, in, an, uninterrupted, line, of, transmission, from, moses, yet, rather, than, being, referred, to, as, rabbis, they, were, called, priests, or, scribes, like, ezra, who, is, called, in, the, bible, ezra, the, priest, the, scribe, a, scribe, of, the, words, of, god, s, commandments, and, of, his, statutes, unto, israel, rabbi, as, a, title, does, not, appear, in, the, hebrew, bible, though, later, rabbinic, sources, occasionally, use, it, as, a, title, for, wise, biblical, figures, with, the, destruction, of, the, two, temples, in, jerusalem, the, end, of, the, jewish, monarchy, and, the, decline, of, the, dual, institutions, of, prophets, and, the, priesthood, the, focus, of, scholarly, and, spiritual, leadership, within, the, jewish, people, shifted, to, the, sages, of, the, men, of, the, great, assembly, anshe, knesset, hagedolah, this, assembly, was, composed, of, the, earliest, group, of, rabbis, in, the, more, modern, sense, of, the, word, in, large, part, because, they, began, the, formulation, and, explication, of, what, became, known, as, judaism, s, oral, law, torah, shebe, al, peh, this, was, eventually, encoded, and, codified, within, the, mishnah, and, talmud, and, subsequent, rabbinical, scholarship, leading, to, what, is, known, as, rabbinic, judaism, the, traditional, explanation, is, that, from, the, 1st, to, 5th, centuries, the, title, rabbi, was, given, to, those, sages, of, the, land, of, israel, who, received, formal, ordination, semicha, while, the, lesser, title, rav, was, given, to, sages, who, taught, in, the, babylonian, academies, as, ordination, could, not, be, performed, outside, the, land, of, israel, sherira, gaon, summarized, the, relationship, between, these, titles, as, follows, rabbi, is, greater, than, rav, rabban, is, greater, than, rabbi, one, s, name, is, greater, than, rabban, however, some, modern, scholars, argue, that, rabbi, and, rav, are, the, same, title, pronounced, differently, due, to, variations, in, dialect, after, the, suppression, of, the, patriarchate, and, sanhedrin, by, theodosius, ii, in, 425, there, was, no, more, formal, ordination, in, the, strict, sense, a, recognised, scholar, could, be, called, rav, or, hacham, like, the, babylonian, sages, the, transmission, of, learning, from, master, to, disciple, remained, of, tremendous, importance, but, there, was, no, formal, rabbinic, qualification, as, such, in, the, early, middle, ages, rabbi, was, not, a, formal, title, but, was, used, as, a, term, of, respect, for, jews, of, great, scholarship, and, reputation, after, the, emergence, of, karaism, jews, who, still, followed, the, talmudic, traditions, became, known, as, rabbanites, initially, communities, might, have, a, religious, judge, appointed, by, the, central, geonate, often, possessing, a, certification, known, as, pitka, dedayanuta, or, bearing, the, title, chaver, short, for, chaver, besanhedrin, hagedolah, used, in, israel, or, aluf, used, in, babylonia, by, the, 11th, century, as, the, geonate, weakened, it, was, common, for, jewish, communities, to, elect, a, local, spiritual, authority, in, the, 11th, 12th, century, some, local, rabbinic, authorities, in, spain, received, formal, certification, known, as, ketav, masmich, or, ketav, minui, in, preparation, for, their, leadership, role, maimonides, ruled, that, every, congregation, is, obliged, to, appoint, a, preacher, and, scholar, to, admonish, the, community, and, teach, torah, and, the, social, institution, he, describes, is, the, germ, of, the, modern, congregational, rabbinate, until, the, black, death, ashkenazi, communities, typically, made, religious, decisions, by, consensus, of, scholars, on, a, council, rather, than, the, decision, of, a, single, authority, in, the, 14th, century, the, concept, arose, of, a, single, person, who, served, as, religious, authority, for, particular, area, the, mara, de, atra, formal, ordination, is, first, recorded, among, ashkenazim, with, meir, ben, baruch, halevi, late, 14th, century, who, issued, the, formal, title, moreinu, our, teacher, to, scholars, though, it, likely, existed, somewhat, earlier, by, the, 15th, century, this, formal, ordination, known, as, semicha, became, necessary, in, order, to, be, recognized, as, a, rabbi, initially, some, sephardic, communities, objected, to, such, formal, ordination, but, over, time, the, system, became, adopted, by, them, too, 13, a, dramatic, change, in, rabbinic, functions, occurred, with, jewish, emancipation, tasks, that, were, once, the, primary, focus, for, rabbis, such, as, settling, disputes, by, presiding, over, a, jewish, court, became, less, prominent, while, other, tasks, that, were, secondary, like, delivering, sermons, increased, in, importance, in, 19th, century, germany, and, the, united, states, the, duties, of, the, rabbi, in, some, respects, became, increasingly, similar, to, the, duties, of, other, clergy, like, the, protestant, christian, minister, and, the, title, pulpit, rabbis, appeared, to, describe, this, phenomenon, sermons, pastoral, counseling, representing, the, community, to, the, outside, all, increased, in, importance, non, orthodox, rabbis, on, a, day, to, day, business, basis, now, spend, more, time, on, these, functions, than, they, do, teaching, or, answering, questions, on, jewish, law, and, philosophy, within, the, modern, orthodox, community, many, rabbis, still, mainly, deal, with, teaching, and, questions, of, jewish, law, but, many, are, increasingly, dealing, with, these, same, pastoral, functions, traditionally, rabbis, have, never, been, an, intermediary, between, god, and, humans, this, idea, was, traditionally, considered, outside, the, bounds, of, jewish, theology, unlike, spiritual, leaders, in, many, other, faiths, they, are, not, considered, to, be, imbued, with, special, powers, or, abilities, rabbis, serve, the, jewish, community, hence, their, functions, vary, as, the, needs, of, the, jewish, community, vary, over, time, and, from, place, to, place, in, antiquity, those, who, performed, rabbinic, functions, such, as, judging, a, case, or, teaching, torah, to, students, did, not, receive, compensation, for, their, services, being, a, rabbi, was, not, a, full, time, profession, and, those, who, served, had, other, occupations, to, support, themselves, and, their, families, such, as, woodchopper, sandal, maker, carpenter, water, carrier, farmer, and, tanner, a, respected, scholar, rabbi, zadok, 1st, cent, ce, had, said, never, to, use, the, torah, as, a, spade, for, digging, and, this, was, understood, to, mean, never, to, use, one, s, torah, knowledge, for, an, inappropriate, purpose, such, as, earning, a, fee, still, as, honored, members, of, the, community, torah, sages, were, allowed, a, series, of, privileges, and, exemptions, that, alleviated, their, financial, burdens, somewhat, these, included, such, things, as, tax, exemption, from, communal, levies, marketplace, priority, first, in, first, out, regarding, their, trade, receiving, personal, services, from, their, students, shimush, talmedei, hakhamim, silent, business, partnerships, with, wealthy, merchants, and, a, substitute, fee, to, replace, their, lost, earnings, when, they, had, to, leave, work, to, perform, a, rabbinic, function, sekhar, battalah, during, the, period, of, the, geonim, c, 650, 1050, ce, opinions, on, compensation, shifted, it, was, deemed, inappropriate, for, the, leaders, of, the, jewish, community, to, appear, in, the, marketplace, as, laborers, or, vendors, of, merchandise, and, leading, a, jewish, community, was, becoming, a, full, time, occupation, under, these, conditions, the, geonim, collected, taxes, and, donations, at, home, and, abroad, to, fund, their, schools, yeshivot, and, paid, salaries, to, teachers, officials, and, judges, of, the, jewish, community, whom, they, appointed, maimonides, 1135, 1204, who, supported, himself, as, a, physician, reasserted, the, traditional, view, of, offering, rabbinic, service, to, the, jewish, community, without, compensation, it, remains, the, ideal, but, circumstances, had, changed, jewish, communities, required, full, time, rabbis, and, the, rabbis, themselves, preferred, to, spend, their, days, studying, and, teaching, torah, rather, than, working, at, a, secular, trade, by, the, fifteenth, century, it, was, the, norm, for, jewish, communities, to, compensate, their, rabbis, although, the, rabbi, s, contract, might, well, refer, to, a, suspension, fee, sekhar, battalah, rather, than, a, salary, as, if, he, were, relinquishing, a, salary, from, secular, employment, the, size, of, salaries, varied, depending, on, the, size, of, the, community, served, with, rabbis, in, large, cities, being, well, compensated, while, rabbis, in, small, towns, might, receive, a, small, stipend, rabbis, were, able, to, supplement, their, rabbinic, incomes, by, engaging, in, associated, functions, and, accepting, fees, for, them, like, serving, as, the, community, s, scribe, notary, and, archivist, teaching, in, the, elementary, school, or, yeshivah, publishing, books, arbitrating, civil, litigations, or, even, serving, as, a, matchmaker, with, the, formation, of, rabbinical, seminaries, starting, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, rabbinate, experienced, a, degree, of, professionalization, that, is, still, underway, at, the, present, time, an, ordained, graduate, of, a, rabbinical, seminary, that, is, affiliated, with, one, of, the, modern, branches, of, judaism, reform, conservative, reconstructionist, or, modern, orthodox, will, find, employment, whether, as, a, congregational, rabbi, teacher, chaplain, hillel, director, camp, director, social, worker, or, administrator, through, the, placement, office, of, his, or, her, seminary, like, any, modern, professional, he, or, she, will, negotiate, the, terms, of, employment, with, potential, employers, and, sign, a, contract, specifying, duties, duration, of, service, salary, benefits, pension, and, the, like, a, rabbi, s, salary, and, benefits, today, tend, to, be, similar, to, those, of, other, modern, professionals, such, as, lawyers, and, accountants, with, similar, levels, of, post, graduate, education, it, is, also, possible, to, engage, in, the, rabbinate, part, time, e, g, at, a, synagogue, with, a, small, membership, the, rabbi, s, salary, will, be, proportionate, to, the, services, rendered, and, he, or, she, will, likely, have, additional, employment, outside, the, synagogue, the, practical, basis, for, rabbinic, authority, involves, the, acceptance, of, the, rabbinic, individual, and, their, scholarly, credentials, in, practical, terms, jewish, communities, and, individuals, commonly, proffer, allegiance, to, the, authority, of, the, rabbi, they, have, chosen, such, a, rabbinic, leader, is, sometimes, called, the, master, of, the, locale, mara, d, atra, jewish, individuals, may, acknowledge, the, authority, of, others, but, will, defer, legal, decisions, to, the, mara, d, atra, the, rabbi, derives, authority, from, achievements, within, a, meritocratic, system, rabbis, authority, is, neither, nominal, nor, spiritual, it, is, based, on, credentials, typically, the, rabbi, receives, an, institutional, stamp, of, approval, it, is, this, authority, that, allows, them, to, engage, in, the, halakhic, process, and, make, legal, prescriptions, the, same, pattern, is, true, within, broader, communities, ranging, from, hasidic, communities, to, rabbinical, or, congregational, organizations, there, will, be, a, formal, or, de, facto, structure, of, rabbinic, authority, that, is, responsible, for, the, members, of, the, community, however, hasidic, communities, do, not, have, a, mere, rabbi, they, have, a, rebbe, who, plays, a, similar, role, but, is, thought, to, have, a, special, connection, to, god, the, rebbes, authority, then, is, based, on, a, spiritual, connection, to, god, and, so, they, are, venerated, in, a, different, way, from, rabbis, according, to, the, talmud, it, is, a, commandment, mitzvah, to, honor, a, rabbi, and, a, torah, scholar, along, with, the, elderly, as, it, is, written, in, leviticus, 19, 32, rise, up, before, the, elderly, and, honor, the, aged, one, should, stand, in, their, presence, and, address, them, with, respect, kohanim, priests, are, required, to, honor, rabbis, and, torah, scholars, like, the, general, public, however, if, one, is, more, learned, than, the, rabbi, or, the, scholar, there, is, no, need, to, stand, the, spouse, of, a, torah, scholar, must, also, be, shown, deference, it, is, also, a, commandment, for, teachers, and, rabbis, to, honor, their, students, rabbis, and, torah, scholars, in, order, to, ensure, discipline, within, the, jewish, community, have, the, authority, to, place, individuals, who, insult, them, under, a, ban, of, excommunication, the, first, recorded, examples, of, ordination, are, moses, transmitting, his, authority, to, joshua, and, the, 70, elders, similarly, elijah, transmitted, his, authority, to, elisha, according, to, pirkei, avot, ordination, was, transmitted, without, interruption, from, moses, to, joshua, to, the, elders, to, the, prophets, to, the, men, of, the, great, assembly, to, the, zugot, to, the, tannaim, the, chain, of, semikhah, was, probably, lost, in, the, 4th, or, 5th, century, though, possibly, as, late, as, the, 12th, century, according, to, maimonides, 12th, century, if, it, were, possible, to, gather, the, greatest, sages, of, the, generation, a, reconstituted, court, could, confer, classic, semikhah, or, ordination, since, then, a, number, of, modern, attempts, to, revive, the, sanhedrin, have, been, made, so, far, no, such, attempt, has, been, accepted, as, valid, among, the, consensus, of, rabbis, or, persisted, for, longer, than, about, a, century, since, the, end, of, classical, ordination, other, forms, of, ordination, have, developed, which, use, much, of, the, same, terminology, but, have, a, lesser, significance, in, jewish, law, nowadays, a, rabbinical, student, is, awarded, semikhah, rabbinic, ordination, after, the, completion, of, a, learning, program, in, a, yeshiva, or, modern, rabbinical, seminary, or, under, the, guidance, of, an, individual, rabbi, the, exact, course, of, study, varies, by, denomination, but, most, are, in, the, range, of, 3, 6, years, the, programs, all, include, study, of, talmud, the, codes, of, jewish, law, and, responsa, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, depending, on, the, branch, of, judaism, in, addition, to, rabbinical, literature, modern, seminaries, offer, courses, in, pastoral, subjects, such, as, counseling, education, comparative, religion, and, delivering, sermons, most, rabbinical, students, will, complete, their, studies, in, their, mid, 20s, there, is, no, hierarchy, and, no, central, authority, in, judaism, that, either, supervises, rabbinic, education, or, records, ordinations, each, branch, of, judaism, regulates, the, ordination, of, the, rabbis, affiliated, with, it, the, most, common, formula, used, on, a, certificate, of, semikhah, is, yore, yore, he, may, teach, he, may, teach, sometimes, rendered, as, a, question, and, answer, may, he, teach, he, may, teach, most, rabbis, hold, this, qualification, they, are, sometimes, called, a, moreh, hora, ah, a, teacher, of, rulings, a, more, advanced, form, of, semikhah, is, yadin, yadin, he, may, judge, he, may, judge, or, may, he, judge, he, may, judge, this, enables, the, recipient, to, serve, as, a, judge, on, a, rabbinical, court, and, adjudicate, cases, of, monetary, law, among, other, responsibilities, the, recipient, of, this, ordination, can, be, formally, addressed, as, a, dayan, judge, and, also, retain, the, title, of, rabbi, only, a, small, percentage, of, rabbis, earn, the, yadin, yadin, ordination, although, not, strictly, necessary, many, orthodox, rabbis, hold, that, a, beth, din, court, of, jewish, law, should, be, made, up, of, dayanim, with, this, ordination, an, orthodox, semikhah, requires, the, successful, completion, of, a, program, encompassing, jewish, law, halakha, and, responsa, in, keeping, with, longstanding, tradition, orthodox, rabbis, typically, study, at, yeshivas, colleges, which, provide, torah, study, generally, and, increasingly, at, dedicated, institutions, known, as, kollelim, both, are, also, referred, to, as, talmudical, rabbinical, schools, or, academies, in, both, cases, the, program, is, effectively, post, graduate, comprising, two, years, on, average, following, at, least, four, years, yeshiva, study, in, achieving, semikhah, rabbinical, students, work, to, gain, knowledge, in, specific, and, relevant, talmudic, sugyas, and, their, development, in, the, rishonim, and, acharonim, early, and, late, medieval, commentators, leading, to, their, application, in, halakha, particularly, as, traced, by, the, tur, building, on, this, is, the, study, of, those, sections, of, the, shulchan, aruch, codified, jewish, law, together, with, its, main, commentaries, that, pertain, to, daily, life, questions, such, as, the, laws, of, keeping, kosher, shabbat, and, the, laws, of, family, purity, an, element, of, shimush, or, apprenticeship, is, often, also, required, religious, zionist, and, modern, orthodox, rabbinical, students, such, as, those, at, the, hesder, yeshivot, and, yeshiva, university, respectively, additionally, formally, study, hashkafa, i, e, the, major, elements, of, theology, and, philosophy, and, their, application, to, contemporary, questions, proceeding, systematically, through, the, classical, rabbinic, works, here, other, students, will, have, studied, these, works, independently, see, yeshiva, ethics, mysticism, and, philosophy, the, entrance, requirements, for, an, orthodox, yeshiva, include, a, strong, background, within, jewish, law, liturgy, talmudic, study, and, attendant, languages, e, g, hebrew, aramaic, and, in, some, cases, yiddish, specifically, students, are, expected, to, have, acquired, deep, analytic, skills, and, breadth, in, talmud, before, commencing, their, rabbinic, studies, at, the, same, time, since, rabbinical, studies, typically, flow, from, other, yeshiva, studies, those, who, seek, semichah, are, typically, not, required, to, have, completed, a, university, education, exceptions, exist, such, as, yeshiva, university, which, requires, all, rabbinical, students, to, complete, an, undergraduate, degree, before, entering, the, program, and, a, masters, or, equivalent, before, ordination, historically, women, could, not, become, orthodox, rabbis, starting, in, 2009, some, modern, orthodox, institutions, began, ordaining, women, with, the, title, of, maharat, and, later, with, titles, including, rabbah, and, rabbi, this, is, currently, a, contested, issue, for, many, orthodox, institutions, leading, some, to, seek, alternate, clerical, titles, and, roles, for, women, see, women, rabbis, and, torah, scholars, orthodox, judaism, toanot, rabniyot, and, yoetzet, halacha, while, some, haredi, including, hasidic, yeshivas, do, grant, official, ordination, to, many, students, wishing, to, become, rabbis, most, of, the, students, within, the, yeshivas, engage, in, learning, torah, or, talmud, without, the, goal, of, becoming, rabbis, or, holding, any, official, positions, the, curriculum, for, obtaining, ordination, as, rabbis, for, haredi, scholars, is, the, same, as, described, above, for, all, orthodox, students, wishing, to, obtain, the, official, title, of, rabbi, and, to, be, recognized, as, such, within, the, hasidic, world, the, positions, of, spiritual, leadership, are, dynastically, transmitted, within, established, families, usually, from, fathers, to, sons, while, a, small, number, of, students, obtain, official, ordination, to, become, dayanim, judges, on, religious, courts, poskim, decisors, of, jewish, law, as, well, as, teachers, in, the, hasidic, schools, the, same, is, true, for, the, non, hasidic, litvish, yeshivas, that, are, controlled, by, dynastically, transmitted, rosh, yeshivas, and, the, majority, of, students, will, not, become, rabbis, even, after, many, years, of, post, graduate, kollel, study, some, yeshivas, such, as, yeshivas, chafetz, chaim, and, yeshivas, ner, yisroel, in, baltimore, maryland, may, encourage, their, students, to, obtain, semichah, and, mostly, serve, as, rabbis, who, teach, in, other, yeshivas, or, hebrew, day, schools, other, yeshivas, such, as, yeshiva, chaim, berlin, brooklyn, new, york, or, the, mirrer, yeshiva, in, brooklyn, and, jerusalem, do, not, have, an, official, semichah, rabbinical, program, to, train, rabbis, but, provide, semichah, on, an, as, needed, basis, if, and, when, one, of, their, senior, students, is, offered, a, rabbinical, position, but, only, with, the, approval, of, their,
