a, belief, is, a, subjective, attitude, that, a, proposition, is, true, or, a, state, of, affairs, is, the, case, a, subjective, attitude, is, a, mental, state, of, having, some, stance, take, or, opinion, about, something, in, epistemology, philosophers, use, the, term, belief, to, refer, to, attitudes, about, the, world, which, can, be, either, true, or, false, to, believe, something, is, to, take, it, to, be, true, for, instance, to, believe, that, snow, is, white, is, comparable, to, accepting, the, truth, of, the, proposition, snow, is, white, however, holding, a, belief, does, not, require, active, introspection, for, example, few, individuals, carefully, consider, whether, or, not, the, sun, will, rise, tomorrow, simply, assuming, that, it, will, moreover, beliefs, need, not, be, occurrent, e, g, a, person, actively, thinking, snow, is, white, but, can, instead, be, dispositional, e, g, a, person, who, if, asked, about, the, color, of, snow, would, assert, snow, is, white, there, are, various, ways, that, contemporary, philosophers, have, tried, to, describe, beliefs, including, as, representations, of, ways, that, the, world, could, be, jerry, fodor, as, dispositions, to, act, as, if, certain, things, are, true, roderick, chisholm, as, interpretive, schemes, for, making, sense, of, someone, s, actions, daniel, dennett, and, donald, davidson, or, as, mental, states, that, fill, a, particular, function, hilary, putnam, some, have, also, attempted, to, offer, significant, revisions, to, our, notion, of, belief, including, eliminativists, about, belief, who, argue, that, there, is, no, phenomenon, in, the, natural, world, which, corresponds, to, our, folk, psychological, concept, of, belief, paul, churchland, and, formal, epistemologists, who, aim, to, replace, our, bivalent, notion, of, belief, either, we, have, a, belief, or, we, don, t, have, a, belief, with, the, more, permissive, probabilistic, notion, of, credence, there, is, an, entire, spectrum, of, degrees, of, belief, not, a, simple, dichotomy, between, belief, and, non, belief, beliefs, are, the, subject, of, various, important, philosophical, debates, notable, examples, include, what, is, the, rational, way, to, revise, one, s, beliefs, when, presented, with, various, sorts, of, evidence, is, the, content, of, our, beliefs, entirely, determined, by, our, mental, states, or, do, the, relevant, facts, have, any, bearing, on, our, beliefs, e, g, if, i, believe, that, i, m, holding, a, glass, of, water, is, the, non, mental, fact, that, water, is, h, 2, o, part, of, the, content, of, that, belief, how, fine, grained, or, coarse, grained, are, our, beliefs, and, must, it, be, possible, for, a, belief, to, be, expressible, in, language, or, are, there, non, linguistic, beliefs, various, conceptions, of, the, essential, features, of, beliefs, have, been, proposed, but, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, which, is, the, right, one, representationalism, is, the, traditionally, dominant, position, its, most, popular, version, maintains, that, attitudes, toward, representations, which, are, typically, associated, with, propositions, are, mental, attitudes, that, constitute, beliefs, these, attitudes, are, part, of, the, internal, constitution, of, the, mind, holding, the, attitude, this, view, contrasts, with, functionalism, which, defines, beliefs, not, in, terms, of, the, internal, constitution, of, the, mind, but, in, terms, of, the, function, or, the, causal, role, played, by, beliefs, according, to, dispositionalism, beliefs, are, identified, with, dispositions, to, behave, in, certain, ways, this, view, can, be, seen, as, a, form, of, functionalism, defining, beliefs, in, terms, of, the, behavior, they, tend, to, cause, interpretationism, constitutes, another, conception, which, has, gained, popularity, in, contemporary, philosophy, it, holds, that, the, beliefs, of, an, entity, are, in, some, sense, dependent, on, or, relative, to, someone, s, interpretation, of, this, entity, representationalism, tends, to, be, associated, with, mind, body, dualism, naturalist, considerations, against, this, dualism, are, among, the, motivations, for, choosing, one, of, the, alternative, conceptions, representationalism, characterizes, beliefs, in, terms, of, mental, representations, representations, are, usually, defined, as, objects, with, semantic, properties, like, having, content, referring, to, something, or, being, true, or, false, beliefs, form, a, special, class, of, mental, representations, since, they, do, not, involve, sensory, qualities, in, order, to, represent, something, unlike, perceptions, or, episodic, memories, because, of, this, it, seems, natural, to, construe, beliefs, as, attitudes, towards, propositions, which, also, constitute, non, sensory, representations, i, e, as, propositional, attitudes, as, mental, attitudes, beliefs, are, characterized, by, both, their, content, and, their, mode, the, content, of, an, attitude, is, what, this, attitude, is, directed, at, its, object, propositional, attitudes, are, directed, at, propositions, beliefs, are, usually, distinguished, from, other, propositional, attitudes, like, desires, by, their, mode, or, the, way, in, which, they, are, directed, at, propositions, the, mode, of, beliefs, has, a, mind, to, world, direction, of, fit, beliefs, try, to, represent, the, world, as, it, is, they, do, not, unlike, desires, involve, an, intention, to, change, it, for, example, if, rahul, believes, that, it, will, be, sunny, today, then, he, has, a, mental, attitude, towards, the, proposition, it, will, be, sunny, today, which, affirms, that, this, proposition, is, true, this, is, different, from, sof, a, s, desire, that, it, will, be, sunny, today, despite, the, fact, that, both, rahul, and, sof, a, have, attitudes, toward, the, same, proposition, the, mind, to, world, direction, of, fit, of, beliefs, is, sometimes, expressed, by, saying, that, beliefs, aim, at, truth, this, aim, is, also, reflected, in, the, tendency, to, revise, one, s, belief, upon, receiving, new, evidence, that, an, existing, belief, is, false, upon, hearing, a, forecast, of, bad, weather, rahul, is, likely, to, change, his, mental, attitude, but, sof, a, is, not, there, are, different, ways, of, conceiving, how, mental, representations, are, realized, in, the, mind, one, form, of, this, is, the, language, of, thought, hypothesis, which, claims, that, mental, representations, have, a, language, like, structure, sometimes, referred, to, as, mentalese, just, like, regular, language, this, involves, simple, elements, that, are, combined, in, various, ways, according, to, syntactic, rules, to, form, more, complex, elements, that, act, as, bearers, of, meaning, on, this, conception, holding, a, belief, would, involve, storing, such, a, complex, element, in, one, s, mind, different, beliefs, are, separated, from, each, other, in, that, they, correspond, to, different, elements, stored, in, the, mind, a, more, holistic, alternative, to, the, language, of, thought, hypothesis, is, the, map, conception, which, uses, an, analogy, of, maps, to, elucidate, the, nature, of, beliefs, according, to, this, view, the, belief, system, of, a, mind, should, be, conceived, of, not, as, a, set, of, many, individual, sentences, but, as, a, map, encoding, the, information, contained, in, these, sentences, for, example, the, fact, that, brussels, is, halfway, between, paris, and, amsterdam, can, be, expressed, both, linguistically, as, a, sentence, and, in, a, map, through, its, internal, geometrical, relations, functionalism, contrasts, with, representationalism, in, that, it, defines, beliefs, not, in, terms, of, the, internal, constitution, of, the, mind, but, in, terms, of, the, function, or, the, causal, role, played, by, them, this, view, is, often, combined, with, the, idea, that, the, same, belief, can, be, realized, in, various, ways, and, that, it, does, not, matter, how, it, is, realized, as, long, as, it, plays, the, causal, role, characteristic, to, it, as, an, analogy, a, hard, drive, is, defined, in, a, functionalist, manner, it, performs, the, function, of, storing, and, retrieving, digital, data, this, function, can, be, realized, in, many, different, ways, being, made, of, plastic, or, steel, or, using, magnetism, or, laser, functionalists, hold, that, something, similar, is, true, for, beliefs, or, mental, states, in, general, among, the, roles, relevant, to, beliefs, is, their, relation, to, perceptions, and, to, actions, perceptions, usually, cause, beliefs, and, beliefs, cause, actions, for, example, seeing, that, a, traffic, light, has, switched, to, red, is, usually, associated, with, a, belief, that, the, light, is, red, which, in, turn, causes, the, driver, to, bring, the, car, to, a, halt, functionalists, use, such, characteristics, to, define, beliefs, whatever, is, caused, by, perceptions, in, a, certain, way, and, also, causes, behavior, in, a, certain, way, is, called, a, belief, this, is, not, just, true, for, humans, but, may, include, animals, hypothetical, aliens, or, even, computers, from, this, perspective, it, would, make, sense, to, ascribe, the, belief, that, a, traffic, light, is, red, to, a, self, driving, car, behaving, just, like, a, human, driver, dispositionalism, is, sometimes, seen, as, a, specific, form, of, functionalism, it, defines, beliefs, only, concerning, their, role, as, causes, of, behavior, or, as, dispositions, to, behave, in, a, certain, way, for, example, a, belief, that, there, is, a, pie, in, the, pantry, is, associated, with, the, disposition, to, affirm, this, when, asked, and, to, go, to, the, pantry, when, hungry, while, it, is, uncontroversial, that, beliefs, shape, our, behavior, the, thesis, that, beliefs, can, be, defined, exclusively, through, their, role, in, producing, behavior, has, been, contested, the, problem, arises, because, the, mechanisms, shaping, our, behavior, seem, to, be, too, complex, to, single, out, the, general, contribution, of, one, particular, belief, for, any, possible, situation, for, example, one, may, decide, not, to, affirm, that, there, is, a, pie, in, the, pantry, when, asked, because, one, wants, to, keep, it, secret, or, one, might, not, eat, the, pie, despite, being, hungry, because, one, also, believes, that, it, is, poisoned, due, to, this, complexity, we, are, unable, to, define, even, a, belief, as, simple, as, this, one, in, terms, of, the, behavioral, dispositions, for, which, it, could, be, responsible, according, to, interpretationism, the, beliefs, of, an, entity, are, in, some, sense, dependent, on, or, relative, to, someone, s, interpretation, of, this, entity, daniel, dennett, is, an, important, defender, of, such, a, position, he, holds, that, we, ascribe, beliefs, to, entities, in, order, to, predict, how, they, will, behave, entities, with, simple, behavioral, patterns, can, be, described, using, physical, laws, or, in, terms, of, their, function, dennett, refers, to, these, forms, of, explanation, as, the, physical, stance, and, the, design, stance, these, stances, are, contrasted, with, the, intentional, stance, which, is, applied, to, entities, with, a, more, complex, behavior, by, ascribing, beliefs, and, desires, to, these, entities, for, example, we, can, predict, that, a, chess, player, will, move, her, queen, to, f7, if, we, ascribe, to, her, the, desire, to, win, the, game, and, the, belief, that, this, move, will, achieve, that, the, same, procedure, can, also, be, applied, to, predicting, how, a, chess, computer, will, behave, the, entity, has, the, belief, in, question, if, this, belief, can, be, used, to, predict, its, behavior, having, a, belief, is, relative, to, an, interpretation, since, there, may, be, different, equally, good, ways, of, ascribing, beliefs, to, predict, behavior, so, there, may, be, another, interpretation, that, predicts, the, move, of, the, queen, to, f7, that, does, not, involve, the, belief, that, this, move, will, win, the, game, another, version, of, interpretationism, is, due, to, donald, davidson, who, uses, the, thought, experiment, of, radical, interpretation, in, which, the, goal, is, to, make, sense, of, the, behavior, and, language, of, another, person, from, scratch, without, any, knowledge, of, this, person, s, language, this, process, involves, ascribing, beliefs, and, desires, to, the, speaker, the, speaker, really, has, these, beliefs, if, this, project, can, be, successful, in, principle, interpretationism, can, be, combined, with, eliminativism, and, instrumentalism, about, beliefs, eliminativists, hold, that, strictly, speaking, there, are, no, beliefs, instrumentalists, agree, with, eliminativists, but, add, that, belief, ascriptions, are, useful, nonetheless, this, usefulness, can, be, explained, in, terms, of, interpretationism, belief, ascriptions, help, us, in, predicting, how, entities, will, behave, it, has, been, argued, that, interpretationism, can, also, be, understood, in, a, more, realistic, sense, that, entities, really, have, the, beliefs, ascribed, to, them, and, that, these, beliefs, participate, in, the, causal, network, but, for, this, to, be, possible, it, may, be, necessary, to, define, interpretationism, as, a, methodology, and, not, as, an, ontological, outlook, on, beliefs, biologist, lewis, wolpert, discusses, the, importance, of, causal, beliefs, and, associates, the, making, and, use, of, tools, with, the, origin, of, human, beliefs, in, the, context, of, ancient, greek, thought, three, related, concepts, were, identified, regarding, the, concept, of, belief, pistis, doxa, and, dogma, simplified, pistis, refers, to, trust, and, confidence, doxa, refers, to, opinion, and, acceptance, and, dogma, refers, to, the, positions, of, a, philosopher, or, of, a, philosophical, school, such, as, stoicism, beliefs, can, be, categorized, into, various, types, depending, on, their, ontological, status, their, degree, their, object, or, their, semantic, properties, having, an, occurrent, belief, that, the, grand, canyon, is, in, arizona, involves, entertaining, the, representation, associated, with, this, belief, for, example, by, actively, thinking, about, it, but, the, great, majority, of, our, beliefs, are, not, active, most, of, the, time, they, are, merely, dispositional, they, usually, become, activated, or, occurrent, when, needed, or, relevant, in, some, way, and, then, fall, back, into, their, dispositional, state, afterward, for, example, the, belief, that, 57, is, greater, than, 14, was, probably, dispositional, to, the, reader, before, reading, this, sentence, has, become, occurrent, while, reading, it, and, may, soon, become, dispositional, again, as, the, mind, focuses, elsewhere, the, distinction, between, occurrent, and, dispositional, beliefs, is, sometimes, identified, with, the, distinction, between, conscious, and, unconscious, beliefs, but, it, has, been, argued, that, despite, overlapping, the, two, distinctions, do, not, match, the, reason, for, this, is, that, beliefs, can, shape, one, s, behavior, and, be, involved, in, one, s, reasoning, even, if, the, subject, is, not, conscious, of, them, such, beliefs, are, cases, of, unconscious, occurrent, mental, states, on, this, view, being, occurrent, corresponds, to, being, active, either, consciously, or, unconsciously, a, dispositional, belief, is, not, the, same, as, a, disposition, to, believe, we, have, various, dispositions, to, believe, given, the, right, perceptions, for, example, to, believe, that, it, is, raining, given, a, perception, of, rain, without, this, perception, there, is, still, a, disposition, to, believe, but, no, actual, dispositional, belief, on, a, dispositionalist, conception, of, belief, there, are, no, occurrent, beliefs, since, all, beliefs, are, defined, in, terms, of, dispositions, an, important, dispute, in, formal, epistemology, concerns, the, question, of, whether, beliefs, should, be, conceptualized, as, full, beliefs, or, as, partial, beliefs, full, beliefs, are, all, or, nothing, attitudes, either, one, has, a, belief, in, a, proposition, or, one, does, not, this, conception, is, sufficient, to, understand, many, belief, ascriptions, found, in, everyday, language, for, example, pedro, s, belief, that, the, earth, is, bigger, than, the, moon, but, some, cases, involving, comparisons, between, beliefs, are, not, easily, captured, through, full, beliefs, alone, for, example, that, pedro, s, belief, that, the, earth, is, bigger, than, the, moon, is, more, certain, than, his, belief, that, the, earth, is, bigger, than, venus, such, cases, are, most, naturally, analyzed, in, terms, of, partial, beliefs, involving, degrees, of, belief, so, called, credences, the, higher, the, degree, of, a, belief, the, more, certain, the, believer, is, that, the, believed, proposition, is, true, this, is, usually, formalized, by, numbers, between, 0, and, 1, a, degree, of, 1, represents, an, absolutely, certain, belief, a, belief, of, 0, corresponds, to, an, absolutely, certain, disbelief, and, all, the, numbers, in, between, correspond, to, intermediate, degrees, of, certainty, in, the, bayesian, approach, these, degrees, are, interpreted, as, subjective, probabilities, e, g, a, belief, of, degree, 0, 9, that, it, will, rain, tomorrow, means, that, the, agent, thinks, that, the, probability, of, rain, tomorrow, is, 90, bayesianism, uses, this, relation, between, beliefs, and, probability, to, define, the, norms, of, rationality, in, terms, of, the, laws, of, probability, this, includes, both, synchronic, laws, about, what, one, should, believe, at, any, moment, and, diachronic, laws, about, how, one, should, revise, one, s, beliefs, upon, receiving, new, evidence, the, central, question, in, the, dispute, between, full, and, partial, beliefs, is, whether, these, two, types, are, really, distinct, types, or, whether, one, type, can, be, explained, in, terms, of, the, other, one, answer, to, this, question, is, called, the, lockean, thesis, it, states, that, partial, beliefs, are, basic, and, that, full, beliefs, are, to, be, conceived, as, partial, beliefs, above, a, certain, threshold, for, example, that, every, belief, above, 0, 9, is, a, full, belief, defenders, of, a, primitive, notion, of, full, belief, on, the, other, hand, have, tried, to, explain, partial, beliefs, as, full, beliefs, about, probabilities, on, this, view, having, a, partial, belief, of, degree, 0, 9, that, it, will, rain, tomorrow, is, the, same, as, having, a, full, belief, that, the, probability, of, rain, tomorrow, is, 90, another, approach, circumvents, the, notion, of, probability, altogether, and, replaces, degrees, of, belief, with, degrees, of, disposition, to, revise, one, s, full, belief, from, this, perspective, both, a, belief, of, degree, 0, 6, and, a, belief, of, degree, 0, 9, may, be, seen, as, full, beliefs, the, difference, between, them, is, that, the, former, belief, can, readily, be, changed, upon, receiving, new, evidence, while, the, latter, is, more, stable, traditionally, philosophers, have, mainly, focused, in, their, inquiries, concerning, belief, on, the, notion, of, belief, that, belief, that, can, be, characterized, as, a, propositional, attitude, to, a, claim, which, is, either, true, or, false, belief, in, on, the, other, hand, is, more, closely, related, to, notions, like, trust, or, faith, in, that, it, refers, usually, to, an, attitude, to, persons, belief, in, plays, a, central, role, in, many, religious, traditions, in, which, belief, in, god, is, one, of, the, central, virtues, of, their, followers, the, difference, between, belief, in, and, belief, that, is, sometimes, blurry, since, various, expressions, using, the, term, belief, in, seem, to, be, translatable, into, corresponding, expressions, using, the, term, belief, that, instead, for, example, a, belief, in, fairies, may, be, said, to, be, a, belief, that, fairies, exist, in, this, sense, belief, in, is, often, used, when, the, entity, is, not, real, or, its, existence, is, in, doubt, typical, examples, would, include, he, believes, in, witches, and, ghosts, or, many, children, believe, in, santa, claus, or, i, believe, in, a, deity, not, all, usages, of, belief, in, concern, the, existence, of, something, some, are, commendatory, in, that, they, express, a, positive, attitude, towards, their, object, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, cases, can, also, be, accounted, for, in, terms, of, belief, that, for, example, a, belief, in, marriage, could, be, translated, as, a, belief, that, marriage, is, good, belief, in, is, used, in, a, similar, sense, when, expressing, self, confidence, or, faith, in, one, s, self, or, one, s, abilities, defenders, of, a, reductive, account, of, belief, in, have, used, this, line, of, thought, to, argue, that, belief, in, god, can, be, analyzed, in, a, similar, way, e, g, that, it, amounts, to, a, belief, that, god, exists, with, his, characteristic, attributes, like, omniscience, and, omnipotence, opponents, of, this, account, often, concede, that, belief, in, may, entail, various, forms, of, belief, that, but, that, there, are, additional, aspects, to, belief, in, that, are, not, reducible, to, belief, that, for, example, a, belief, in, an, ideal, may, involve, the, belief, that, this, ideal, is, something, good, but, it, additionally, involves, a, positive, evaluative, attitude, toward, this, ideal, that, goes, beyond, a, mere, propositional, attitude, applied, to, the, belief, in, god, opponents, of, the, reductive, approach, may, hold, that, a, belief, that, god, exists, may, be, a, necessary, pre, condition, for, belief, in, god, but, that, it, is, not, sufficient, the, difference, between, de, dicto, and, de, re, beliefs, or, the, corresponding, ascriptions, concerns, the, contributions, singular, terms, like, names, and, other, referential, devices, make, to, the, semantic, properties, of, the, belief, or, its, ascription, in, regular, contexts, the, truth, value, of, a, sentence, does, not, change, upon, substitution, of, co, referring, terms, for, example, since, the, names, superman, and, clark, kent, refer, to, the, same, person, we, can, replace, one, with, the, other, in, the, sentence, superman, is, strong, without, changing, its, truth, value, this, issue, is, more, complicated, in, case, of, belief, ascriptions, for, example, lois, believes, that, superman, is, strong, but, she, does, not, believe, that, clark, kent, is, strong, this, difficulty, arises, due, to, the, fact, that, she, does, not, know, that, the, two, names, refer, to, the, same, entity, beliefs, or, belief, ascriptions, for, which, this, substitution, does, not, generally, work, are, de, dicto, otherwise, they, are, de, re, in, a, de, re, sense, lois, does, believe, that, clark, kent, is, strong, while, in, a, de, dicto, sense, she, does, not, the, contexts, corresponding, to, de, dicto, ascriptions, are, known, as, referentially, opaque, contexts, while, de, re, ascriptions, are, referentially, transparent, a, collective, belief, is, referred, to, when, people, speak, of, what, we, believe, when, this, is, not, simply, elliptical, for, what, we, all, believe, sociologist, mile, durkheim, wrote, of, collective, beliefs, and, proposed, that, they, like, all, social, facts, inhered, in, social, groups, as, opposed, to, individual, persons, jonathan, dancy, states, that, durkheim, s, discussion, of, collective, belief, though, suggestive, is, relatively, obscure, margaret, gilbert, has, offered, a, related, account, in, terms, of, the, joint, commitment, of, a, number, of, persons, as, a, body, to, accept, a, certain, belief, according, to, this, account, individuals, who, together, collectively, believe, something, need, not, personally, believe, it, individually, gilbert, s, work, on, the, topic, has, stimulated, a, developing, literature, among, philosophers, one, question, that, has, arisen, is, whether, and, how, philosophical, accounts, of, belief, in, general, need, to, be, sensitive, to, the, possibility, of, collective, belief, collective, belief, can, play, a, role, in, social, control, and, serve, as, a, touchstone, for, identifying, and, purging, heresies, deviancy, or, political, deviationism, as, mental, representations, beliefs, have, contents, which, is, what, the, belief, is, about, or, what, it, represents, within, philosophy, there, are, various, disputes, about, how, the, contents, of, beliefs, are, to, be, understood, holists, and, molecularists, hold, that, the, content, of, one, particular, belief, depends, on, or, is, determined, by, other, beliefs, belonging, to, the, same, subject, which, is, denied, by, atomists, the, question, of, dependence, or, determination, also, plays, a, central, role, in, the, internalism, externalism, debate, internalism, states, that, the, contents, of, someone, s, beliefs, depend, only, on, what, is, internal, to, that, person, and, are, determined, entirely, by, things, going, on, inside, this, person, s, head, externalism, on, the, other, hand, holds, that, the, relations, to, one, s, environment, also, have, a, role, to, play, in, this, the, disagreement, between, atomism, molecularism, and, holism, concerns, the, question, of, how, the, content, of, one, belief, depends, on, the, contents, of, other, beliefs, held, by, the, same, subject, atomists, deny, such, dependence, relations, molecularists, restrict, them, to, only, a, few, closely, related, beliefs, while, holists, hold, that, they, may, obtain, between, any, two, beliefs, however, unrelated, they, seem, for, example, assume, that, mei, and, benjamin, both, affirm, that, jupiter, is, a, planet, the, most, straightforward, explanation, given, by, the, atomists, would, be, that, they, have, the, same, belief, i, e, that, they, hold, the, same, content, to, be, true, but, now, assume, that, mei, also, believes, that, pluto, is, a, planet, which, is, denied, by, benjamin, this, indicates, that, they, have, different, concepts, of, planet, which, would, mean, that, they, were, affirming, different, contents, when, they, both, agreed, that, jupiter, is, a, planet, this, reasoning, leads, to, molecularism, or, holism, because, the, content, of, the, jupiter, belief, depends, on, the, pluto, belief, in, this, example, an, important, motivation, for, this, position, comes, from, w, v, quine, s, confirmational, holism, which, holds, that, because, of, this, interconnectedness, we, cannot, confirm, or, disconfirm, individual, hypotheses, that, confirmation, happens, on, the, level, of, the, theory, as, a, whole, another, motivation, is, due, to, considerations, of, the, nature, of, learning, it, is, often, not, possible, to, understand, one, concept, like, force, in, newtonian, physics, without, understanding, other, concepts, like, mass, or, kinetic, energy, one, problem, for, holism, is, that, genuine, disagreements, seem, to, be, impossible, or, very, rare, disputants, would, usually, talk, past, each, other, since, they, never, share, exactly, the, same, web, of, beliefs, needed, to, determine, the, content, of, the, source, of, the, disagreement, internalism, and, externalism, disagree, about, whether, the, contents, of, our, beliefs, are, determined, only, by, what, s, happening, in, our, head, or, also, by, other, factors, internalists, deny, such, a, dependence, on, external, factors, they, hold, that, a, person, and, a, molecule, by, molecule, copy, would, have, exactly, the, same, beliefs, hilary, putnam, objects, to, this, position, by, way, of, his, twin, earth, thought, experiment, he, imagines, a, twin, earth, in, another, part, of, the, universe, that, is, exactly, like, ours, except, that, their, water, has, a, different, chemical, composition, despite, behaving, just, like, ours, according, to, putnam, the, reader, s, thought, that, water, is, wet, is, about, our, water, while, the, reader, s, twin, s, thought, on, twin, earth, that, water, is, wet, is, about, their, water, this, is, the, case, despite, the, fact, that, the, two, readers, have, the, same, molecular, composition, so, it, seems, necessary, to, include, external, factors, in, order, to, explain, the, difference, one, problem, with, this, position, is, that, this, difference, in, content, does, not, bring, any, causal, difference, with, it, the, two, readers, act, in, exactly, the, same, way, this, casts, doubt, on, the, thesis, that, there, is, any, genuine, difference, in, need, of, explanation, between, the, contents, of, the, two, beliefs, epistemology, is, concerned, with, delineating, the, boundary, between, justified, belief, and, opinion, and, involved, generally, with, a, theoretical, philosophical, study, of, knowledge, the, primary, problem, in, epistemology, is, to, understand, what, is, needed, to, have, knowledge, in, a, notion, derived, from, plato, s, dialogue, theaetetus, where, the, epistemology, of, socrates, most, clearly, departs, from, that, of, the, sophists, who, appear, to, have, defined, knowledge, as, justified, true, belief, the, tendency, to, base, knowledge, episteme, on, common, opinion, doxa, socrates, dismisses, results, from, failing, to, distinguish, a, dispositive, belief, doxa, from, knowledge, episteme, when, the, opinion, is, regarded, correct, n, b, orth, not, alethia, in, terms, of, right, and, juristically, so, according, to, the, premises, of, the, dialogue, which, was, the, task, of, the, rhetors, to, prove, plato, dismisses, this, possibility, of, an, affirmative, relation, between, opinion, and, knowledge, even, when, the, one, who, opines, grounds, his, belief, on, the, rule, and, is, able, to, add, justification, logos, reasonable, and, necessarily, plausible, assertions, evidence, guidance, to, it, a, belief, can, be, based, fully, or, partially, on, intuition, plato, has, been, credited, for, the, justified, true, belief, theory, of, knowledge, even, though, plato, in, the, theaetetus, elegantly, dismisses, it, and, even, posits, this, argument, of, socrates, as, a, cause, for, his, death, penalty, the, epistemologists, gettier, and, goldman, have, questioned, the, justified, true, belief, definition, justified, true, belief, is, a, definition, of, knowledge, that, gained, approval, during, the, enlightenment, justified, standing, in, contrast, to, revealed, there, have, been, attempts, to, trace, it, back, to, plato, and, his, dialogues, more, specifically, in, the, theaetetus, and, the, meno, the, concept, of, justified, true, belief, states, that, in, order, to, know, that, a, given, proposition, is, true, one, must, not, only, believe, the, relevant, true, proposition, but, also, have, justification, for, doing, so, in, more, formal, terms, an, agent, s, displaystyle, s, knows, that, a, proposition, p, displaystyle, p, is, true, if, and, only, if, that, theory, of, knowledge, suffered, a, significant, setback, with, the, discovery, of, gettier, problems, situations, in, which, the, above, conditions, were, seemingly, met, but, where, many, philosophers, deny, that, anything, is, known, robert, nozick, suggested, a, clarification, of, justification, which, he, believed, eliminates, the, problem, the, justification, has, to, be, such, that, were, the, justification, false, the, knowledge, would, be, false, bernecker, and, dretske, 2000, argue, that, no, epistemologist, since, gettier, has, seriously, and, successfully, defended, the, traditional, view, 3, on, the, other, hand, paul, boghossian, argues, that, the, justified, true, belief, account, is, the, standard, widely, accepted, definition, of, knowledge, a, belief, system, comprises, a, set, of, mutually, supportive, beliefs, the, beliefs, of, any, such, system, can, be, religious, philosophical, political, ideological, or, a, combination, of, these, the, british, philosopher, jonathan, glover, following, meadows, 2008, says, that, beliefs, are, always, part, of, a, belief, system, and, that, tenanted, belief, systems, are, difficult, for, the, tenants, to, completely, revise, or, reject, he, suggests, that, beliefs, have, to, be, considered, holistically, and, that, no, belief, exists, in, isolation, in, the, mind, of, the, believer, each, belief, always, implicates, and, relates, to, other, beliefs, glover, provides, the, example, of, a, patient, with, an, illness, who, returns, to, a, doctor, but, the, doctor, says, that, the, prescribed, medicine, is, not, working, at, that, point, the, patient, has, a, great, deal, of, flexibility, in, choosing, what, beliefs, to, keep, or, reject, the, patient, could, believe, that, the, doctor, is, incompetent, that, the, doctor, s, assistants, made, a, mistake, that, the, patient, s, own, body, is, unique, in, some, unexpected, way, that, western, medicine, is, ineffective, or, even, that, western, science, is, entirely, unable, to, discover, truths, about, ailments, this, insight, has, relevance, for, inquisitors, missionaries, agitprop, groups, and, thought, police, the, british, philosopher, stephen, law, has, described, some, belief, systems, including, belief, in, homeopathy, psychic, powers, and, alien, abduction, as, claptrap, and, says, that, such, belief, systems, can, draw, people, in, and, hold, them, captive, so, they, become, willing, slaves, of, claptrap, if, you, get, sucked, in, it, can, be, extremely, difficult, to, think, your, way, clear, again, religion, is, a, personal, set, or, institutionalized, system, of, religious, attitudes, beliefs, and, practices, the, service, or, worship, of, god, or, the, supernatural, religious, belief, is, distinct, from, religious, practice, and, from, religious, behaviours, with, some, believers, not, practicing, religion, and, some, practitioners, not, believing, religion, belief, is, no, less, of, a, theoretical, term, than, is, religion, religious, beliefs, often, relate, to, the, existence, characteristics, and, worship, of, a, deity, or, deities, to, the, idea, of, divine, intervention, in, the, universe, and, in, human, life, or, to, the, deontological, explanations, for, the, values, and, practices, centered, on, the, teachings, of, a, spiritual, leader, or, community, in, contrast, to, other, belief, systems, religious, beliefs, are, usually, codified, a, popular, view, holds, that, different, religions, each, have, identifiable, and, exclusive, sets, of, beliefs, or, creeds, but, surveys, of, religious, belief, have, often, found, that, the, official, doctrine, and, descriptions, of, the, beliefs, offered, by, religious, authorities, do, not, always, agree, with, the, privately, held, beliefs, of, those, who, identify, as, members, of, a, particular, religion, for, a, broad, classification, of, the, kinds, of, religious, belief, see, below, first, self, applied, as, a, term, to, the, conservative, doctrine, outlined, by, anti, modernist, protestants, in, the, united, states, fundamentalism, in, religious, terms, denotes, strict, adherence, to, an, interpretation, of, scriptures, that, are, generally, associated, with, theologically, conservative, positions, or, traditional, understandings, of, the, text, and, are, distrustful, of, innovative, readings, new, revelation, or, alternative, interpretations, religious, fundamentalism, has, been, identified, in, the, media, as, being, associated, with, fanatical, or, zealous, political, movements, around, the, world, that, have, used, a, strict, adherence, to, a, particular, religious, doctrine, as, a, means, to, establish, political, identity, and, to, enforce, societal, norms, first, used, in, the, context, of, early, christianity, the, term, orthodoxy, relates, to, religious, belief, that, closely, follows, the, edicts, apologies, and, hermeneutics, of, a, prevailing, religious, authority, in, the, case, of, early, christianity, this, authority, was, the, communion, of, bishops, and, is, often, referred, to, by, the, term, magisterium, the, term, orthodox, was, applied, almost, as, an, epithet, to, a, group, of, jewish, believers, who, held, to, pre, enlightenment, understanding, of, judaism, now, known, as, orthodox, judaism, the, eastern, orthodox, church, of, christianity, and, the, catholic, church, each, consider, themselves, to, be, the, true, heir, to, early, christian, belief, and, practice, the, antonym, of, orthodox, is, heterodox, and, those, adhering, to, orthodoxy, often, accuse, the, heterodox, of, apostasy, schism, or, heresy, the, renaissance, and, later, the, enlightenment, in, europe, exhibited, varying, degrees, of, religious, tolerance, and, intolerance, towards, new, and, old, religious, ideas, the, philosophes, took, particular, exception, to, many, of, the, more, fantastical, claims, of, religions, and, directly, challenged, religious, authority, and, the, prevailing, beliefs, associated, with, the, established, churches, in, response, to, the, liberalizing, political, and, social, movements, some, religious, groups, attempted, to, integrate, enlightenment, ideals, of, rationality, equality, and, individual, liberty, into, their, belief, systems, especially, in, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, reform, judaism, and, liberal, christianity, offer, two, examples, of, such, religious, associations, adherents, of, particular, religions, deal, with, the, differing, doctrines, and, practices, espoused, by, other, religions, or, by, other, religious, denominations, in, a, variety, of, ways, people, with, exclusivist, beliefs, typically, explain, other, beliefs, either, as, in, error, or, as, corruptions, or, counterfeits, of, the, true, faith, this, approach, is, a, fairly, consistent, feature, among, smaller, new, religious, movements, that, often, rely, on, doctrine, that, claims, a, unique, revelation, by, the, founders, or, leaders, and, considers, it, a, matter, of, faith, that, the, correct, religion, has, a, monopoly, on, truth, all, three, major, abrahamic, monotheistic, religions, have, passages, in, their, holy, scriptures, that, attest, to, the, primacy, of, the, scriptural, testimony, and, indeed, monotheism, itself, is, often, vouched, as, an, innovation, characterized, specifically, by, its, explicit, rejection, of, earlier, polytheistic, faiths, some, exclusivist, faiths, incorporate, a, specific, element, of, proselytization, this, is, a, strongly, held, belief, in, the, christian, tradition, which, follows, the, doctrine, of, the, great, commission, and, is, less, emphasized, by, the, islamic, faith, where, the, quranic, edict, there, shall, be, no, compulsion, in, religion, 2, 256, is, often, quoted, as, a, justification, for, toleration, of, alternative, beliefs, the, jewish, tradition, does, not, actively, seek, out, converts, exclusivism, correlates, with, conservative, fundamentalist, and, orthodox, approaches, of, many, religions, while, pluralistic, and, syncretist, approaches, either, explicitly, downplay, or, reject, the, exclusivist, tendencies, within, a, religion, people, with, inclusivist, beliefs, recognize, some, truth, in, all, faith, systems, highlighting, agreements, and, minimizing, differences, this, attitude, is, sometimes, associated, with, interfaith, dialogue, or, with, the, christian, ecumenical, movement, though, in, principle, such, attempts, at, pluralism, are, not, necessarily, inclusivist, and, many, actors, in, such, interactions, for, example, the, roman, catholic, church, still, hold, to, exclusivist, dogma, while, participating, in, inter, religious, organizations, explicitly, inclusivist, religions, include, many, that, are, associated, with, the, new, age, movement, as, well, as, modern, reinterpretations, of, hinduism, and, buddhism, the, bah, faith, considers, it, doctrine, that, there, is, truth, in, all, faith, systems, pluralism, and, syncretism, are, two, closely, related, concepts, people, with, pluralist, beliefs, make, no, distinction, between, faith, systems, viewing, each, one, as, valid, within, a, particular, culture, people, with, syncretic, views, blend, the, views, of, a, variety, of, different, religions, or, traditional, beliefs, into, a, unique, fusion, which, suits, their, particular, experiences, and, contexts, eclecticism, unitarian, universalism, exemplifies, a, syncretic, faith, typical, reasons, for, adherence, to, religion, include, the, following, psychologist, james, alcock, also, summarizes, a, number, of, apparent, benefits, which, reinforce, religious, belief, these, include, prayer, appearing, to, account, for, successful, resolution, of, problems, a, bulwark, against, existential, anxiety, and, fear, of, annihilation, an, increased, sense, of, control, companionship, with, one, s, deity, a, source, of, self, significance, and, group, identity, typical, reasons, for, rejection, of, religion, include, mainstream, psychology, and, related, disciplines, have, traditionally, treated, belief, as, if, it, were, the, simplest, form, of, mental, representation, and, therefore, one, of, the, building, blocks, of, conscious, thought, philosophers, have, tended, to, be, more, abstract, in, their, analysis, and, much, of, the, work, examining, the, viability, of, the, belief, concept, stems, from, philosophical, analysis, the, concept, of, belief, presumes, a, subject, the, believer, and, an, object, of, belief, the, proposition, like, other, propositional, attitudes, belief, implies, the, existence, of, mental, states, and, intentionality, both, of, which, are, hotly, debated, topics, in, the, philosophy, of, mind, whose, foundations, and, relation, to, brain, states, are, still, controversial, beliefs, are, sometimes, divided, into, core, beliefs, that, are, actively, thought, about, and, dispositional, beliefs, that, may, be, ascribed, to, someone, who, has, not, thought, about, the, issue, for, example, if, asked, do, you, believe, tigers, wear, pink, pajamas, a, person, might, answer, that, they, do, not, despite, the, fact, they, may, never, have, thought, about, this, situation, before, philosopher, lynne, rudder, baker, has, outlined, four, main, contemporary, approaches, to, belief, in, her, book, saving, belief, strategic, approaches, make, a, distinction, between, rules, norms, and, beliefs, as, follows, belief, revision, is, a, term, commonly, used, to, refer, to, the, modification, of, beliefs, an, extensive, amount, of, scientific, research, and, philosophical, discussion, exists, around, belief, revision, generally, speaking, the, process, of, belief, revision, entails, the, believer, weighing, the, set, of, truths, and, or, evidence, and, the, dominance, of, a, set, of, truths, or, evidence, on, an, alternative, to, a, held, belief, can, lead, to, revision, one, process, of, belief, revision, is, bayesian, updating, or, bayesian, inference, and, is, often, referenced, for, its, mathematical, basis, and, conceptual, simplicity, however, such, a, process, may, not, be, representative, for, individuals, whose, beliefs, are, not, easily, characterized, as, probabilistic, there, are, several, techniques, for, individuals, or, groups, to, change, the, beliefs, of, others, these, methods, generally, fall, under, the, umbrella, of, persuasion, persuasion, can, take, on, more, specific, forms, such, as, consciousness, raising, when, considered, in, an, activist, or, political, context, belief, modification, may, also, occur, as, a, result, of, the, experience, of, outcomes, because, goals, are, based, in, part, on, beliefs, the, success, or, failure, at, a, particular, goal, may, contribute, to, modification, of, beliefs, that, supported, the, original, goal, whether, or, not, belief, modification, actually, occurs, is, dependent, not, only, on, the, extent, of, truths, or, evidence, for, the, alternative, belief, but, also, characteristics, outside, the, specific, truths, or, evidence, this, includes, but, is, not, limited, to, the, source, characteristics, of, the, message, such, as, credibility, social, pressures, the, anticipated, consequences, of, a, modification, or, the, ability, of, the, individual, or, group, to, act, on, the, modification, therefore, individuals, seeking, to, achieve, belief, modification, in, themselves, or, others, need, to, consider, all, possible, forms, of, resistance, to, belief, revision, glover, maintains, that, any, person, can, continue, to, hold, any, belief, if, they, would, really, like, to, for, example, with, help, from, ad, hoc, hypotheses, one, belief, can, be, held, fixed, and, other, beliefs, will, be, altered, around, it, glover, warns, that, some, beliefs, may, not, be, entirely, explicitly, believed, for, example, some, people, may, not, realize, they, have, racist, belief, systems, adopted, from, their, environment, as, a, child, glover, believes, that, people, tend, to, first, realize, that, beliefs, can, change, and, may, be, contingent, on, their, upbringing, around, age, 12, or, 15, glover, emphasizes, that, beliefs, are, difficult, to, change, he, says, that, one, may, try, to, rebuild, one, s, beliefs, on, more, secure, foundations, axioms, like, building, a, new, house, but, warns, that, this, may, not, be, possible, glover, offers, the, example, of, ren, descartes, saying, starts, off, with, the, characteristic, beliefs, of, a, 17th, century, frenchman, he, then, junks, the, lot, he, rebuilds, the, system, and, somehow, it, looks, a, lot, like, the, beliefs, of, a, 17th, century, frenchman, to, glover, belief, systems, are, not, like, houses, but, are, instead, like, boats, as, glover, puts, it, maybe, the, whole, thing, needs, rebuilding, but, inevitably, at, any, point, you, have, to, keep, enough, of, it, intact, to, keep, floating, psychologists, study, belief, formation, and, the, relationship, between, beliefs, and, actions, three, types, of, models, of, belief, formation, and, change, have, been, proposed, conditional, inference, process, models, linear, models, and, information, processing, models, conditional, inference, process, models, emphasize, the, role, of, inference, for, belief, formation, when, asked, to, estimate, the, likelihood, that, a, statement, is, true, people, allegedly, search, their, memory, for, information, that, has, implications, for, the, validity, of, this, statement, once, this, information, has, been, identified, they, estimate, the, likelihood, that, the, statement, would, be, true, if, the, information, were, true, and, the, likelihood, that, the, statement, would, be, true, if, the, information, were, false, if, their, estimates, for, these, two, probabilities, differ, people, average, them, weighting, each, by, the, likelihood, that, the, information, is, true, and, false, thus, information, bears, directly, on, beliefs, of, another, related, statement, unlike, the, previous, model, linear, models, take, into, consideration, the, possibility, of, multiple, factors, influencing, belief, formation, using, regression, procedures, these, models, predict, belief, formation, on, the, basis, of, several, different, pieces, of, information, with, weights, assigned, to, each, piece, on, the, basis, of, their, relative, importance, information, processing, models, address, the, fact, that, the, responses, people, have, to, belief, relevant, information, is, unlikely, to, be, predicted, from, the, objective, basis, of, the, information, that, they, can, recall, at, the, time, their, beliefs, are, reported, instead, these, responses, reflect, the, number, and, meaning, of, the, thoughts, that, people, have, about, the, message, at, the, time, that, they, encounter, it, some, influences, on, people, s, belief, formation, include, however, even, educated, people, well, aware, of, the, process, by, which, beliefs, form, still, strongly, cling, to, their, beliefs, and, act, on, those, beliefs, even, against, their, own, self, interest, in, her, book, leadership, therapy, anna, rowley, states, you, want, your, beliefs, to, change, it, s, proof, that, you, are, keeping, your, eyes, open, living, fully, and, welcoming, everything, that, the, world, and, people, around, you, can, teach, you, this, view, implies, that, peoples, beliefs, may, evolve, as, they, gain, new, experiences, different, psychological, models, have, tried, to, predict, people, s, beliefs, and, some, of, them, try, to, estimate, the, exact, probabilities, of, beliefs, for, example, robert, wyer, developed, a, model, of, subjective, probabilities, when, people, rate, the, likelihood, of, a, certain, statement, e, g, it, will, rain, tomorrow, this, rating, can, be, seen, as, a, subjective, probability, value, the, subjective, probability, model, posits, that, these, subjective, probabilities, follow, the, same, rules, as, objective, probabilities, for, example, the, law, of, total, probability, might, be, applied, to, predict, a, subjective, probability, value, wyer, found, that, this, model, produces, relatively, accurate, predictions, for, probabilities, of, single, events, and, for, changes, in, these, probabilities, but, that, the, probabilities, of, several, beliefs, linked, by, and, or, or, do, not, follow, the, model, as, well, in, the, dsm, 5, delusions, are, defined, as, fixed, false, beliefs, that, are, not, changed, even, when, confronted, with, conflicting, evidence, there, is, research, investigating, specific, beliefs, types, of, beliefs, and, patterns, of, beliefs, for, example, a, study, estimated, contemporary, prevalence, and, associations, with, belief, in, witchcraft, around, the, world, which, in, its, data, varied, between, 9, and, 90, between, nations, and, is, still, a, widespread, element, in, worldviews, globally, it, also, shows, associations, such, as, with, lower, innovative, activity, higher, levels, of, anxiety, lower, life, expectancy, and, higher, religiosity, other, research, is, investigating, beliefs, in, misinformation, and, their, resistance, to, correction, including, with, respect, to, misinformation, countermeasures, it, describes, cognitive, social, and, affective, processes, that, leave, people, vulnerable, to, the, formation, of, false, beliefs, a, study, introduced, the, concept, of, false, social, reality, which, refers, to, widespread, perceptions, of, public, opinion, that, are, shown, to, be, false, such, as, underestimated, general, public, support, in, the, u, s, for, climate, change, mitigation, policies, studies, also, suggested, some, uses, of, psychedelics, can, shift, beliefs, in, some, humans, in, certain, ways, such, as, increasing, attribution, of, consciousness, to, various, entities, including, plants, and, inanimate, objects, and, towards, panpsychism, and, fatalism, research, has, indicated, that, emotion, and, cognition, act, in, conjunction, to, produce, beliefs, and, more, specifically, emotion, plays, a, vital, role, in, the, formation, and, maintenance, of, beliefs
