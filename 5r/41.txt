an, argument, is, a, series, of, sentences, statements, or, propositions, some, of, which, are, called, premises, and, one, is, the, conclusion, the, purpose, of, an, argument, is, to, give, reasons, for, one, s, conclusion, via, justification, explanation, and, or, persuasion, arguments, are, intended, to, determine, or, show, the, degree, of, truth, or, acceptability, of, another, statement, called, a, conclusion, the, process, of, crafting, or, delivering, arguments, argumentation, can, be, studied, from, three, main, perspectives, the, logical, the, dialectical, and, the, rhetorical, perspective, in, logic, an, argument, is, usually, expressed, not, in, natural, language, but, in, a, symbolic, formal, language, and, it, can, be, defined, as, any, group, of, propositions, of, which, one, is, claimed, to, follow, from, the, others, through, deductively, valid, inferences, that, preserve, truth, from, the, premises, to, the, conclusion, this, logical, perspective, on, argument, is, relevant, for, scientific, fields, such, as, mathematics, and, computer, science, logic, is, the, study, of, the, forms, of, reasoning, in, arguments, and, the, development, of, standards, and, criteria, to, evaluate, arguments, deductive, arguments, can, be, valid, and, the, valid, ones, can, be, sound, in, a, valid, argument, premises, necessitate, the, conclusion, even, if, one, or, more, of, the, premises, is, false, and, the, conclusion, is, false, in, a, sound, argument, true, premises, necessitate, a, true, conclusion, inductive, arguments, by, contrast, can, have, different, degrees, of, logical, strength, the, stronger, or, more, cogent, the, argument, the, greater, the, probability, that, the, conclusion, is, true, the, weaker, the, argument, the, lesser, that, probability, the, standards, for, evaluating, non, deductive, arguments, may, rest, on, different, or, additional, criteria, than, truth, for, example, the, persuasiveness, of, so, called, indispensability, claims, in, transcendental, arguments, the, quality, of, hypotheses, in, retroduction, or, even, the, disclosure, of, new, possibilities, for, thinking, and, acting, in, dialectics, and, also, in, a, more, colloquial, sense, an, argument, can, be, conceived, as, a, social, and, verbal, means, of, trying, to, resolve, or, at, least, contend, with, a, conflict, or, difference, of, opinion, that, has, arisen, or, exists, between, two, or, more, parties, for, the, rhetorical, perspective, the, argument, is, constitutively, linked, with, the, context, in, particular, with, the, time, and, place, in, which, the, argument, is, located, from, this, perspective, the, argument, is, evaluated, not, just, by, two, parties, as, in, a, dialectical, approach, but, also, by, an, audience, in, both, dialectic, and, rhetoric, arguments, are, used, not, through, formal, but, through, natural, language, since, classical, antiquity, philosophers, and, rhetoricians, have, developed, lists, of, argument, types, in, which, premises, and, conclusions, are, connected, in, informal, and, defeasible, ways, the, latin, root, arguere, to, make, bright, enlighten, make, known, prove, etc, is, from, proto, indo, european, argu, yo, suffixed, form, of, arg, to, shine, white, informal, arguments, as, studied, in, informal, logic, are, presented, in, ordinary, language, and, are, intended, for, everyday, discourse, formal, arguments, are, studied, in, formal, logic, historically, called, symbolic, logic, more, commonly, referred, to, as, mathematical, logic, today, and, are, expressed, in, a, formal, language, informal, logic, emphasizes, the, study, of, argumentation, formal, logic, emphasizes, implication, and, inference, informal, arguments, are, sometimes, implicit, the, rational, structure, the, relationship, of, claims, premises, warrants, relations, of, implication, and, conclusion, is, not, always, spelled, out, and, immediately, visible, and, must, be, made, explicit, by, analysis, there, are, several, kinds, of, arguments, in, logic, the, best, known, of, which, are, deductive, and, inductive, an, argument, has, one, or, more, premises, but, only, one, conclusion, each, premise, and, the, conclusion, are, truth, bearers, or, truth, candidates, each, capable, of, being, either, true, or, false, but, not, both, these, truth, values, bear, on, the, terminology, used, with, arguments, a, deductive, argument, asserts, that, the, truth, of, the, conclusion, is, a, logical, consequence, of, the, premises, if, the, premises, are, true, the, conclusion, must, be, true, it, would, be, self, contradictory, to, assert, the, premises, and, deny, the, conclusion, because, the, negation, of, the, conclusion, is, contradictory, to, the, truth, of, the, premises, based, on, the, premises, the, conclusion, follows, necessarily, with, certainty, given, premises, that, a, b, and, b, c, then, the, conclusion, follows, necessarily, that, a, c, deductive, arguments, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, truth, preserving, arguments, for, example, consider, the, argument, that, because, bats, can, fly, premise, true, and, all, flying, creatures, are, birds, premise, false, therefore, bats, are, birds, conclusion, false, if, we, assume, the, premises, are, true, the, conclusion, follows, necessarily, and, it, is, a, valid, argument, in, terms, of, validity, deductive, arguments, may, be, either, valid, or, invalid, an, argument, is, valid, if, and, only, if, iff, it, is, impossible, in, all, possible, worlds, for, the, premises, to, be, true, and, the, conclusion, false, validity, is, about, what, is, possible, it, is, concerned, with, how, the, premises, and, conclusion, relate, and, what, is, possible, an, argument, is, formally, valid, if, and, only, if, the, denial, of, the, conclusion, is, incompatible, with, accepting, all, the, premises, in, formal, logic, the, validity, of, an, argument, depends, not, on, the, actual, truth, or, falsity, of, its, premises, and, conclusion, but, on, whether, the, argument, has, a, valid, logical, form, the, validity, of, an, argument, is, not, a, guarantee, of, the, truth, of, its, conclusion, a, valid, argument, may, have, false, premises, that, render, it, inconclusive, the, conclusion, of, a, valid, argument, with, one, or, more, false, premises, may, be, true, or, false, logic, seeks, to, discover, the, forms, that, make, arguments, valid, a, form, of, argument, is, valid, if, and, only, if, the, conclusion, is, true, under, all, interpretations, of, that, argument, in, which, the, premises, are, true, since, the, validity, of, an, argument, depends, on, its, form, an, argument, can, be, shown, invalid, by, showing, that, its, form, is, invalid, this, can, be, done, by, a, counter, example, of, the, same, form, of, argument, with, premises, that, are, true, under, a, given, interpretation, but, a, conclusion, that, is, false, under, that, interpretation, in, informal, logic, this, is, called, a, counter, argument, the, form, of, an, argument, can, be, shown, by, the, use, of, symbols, for, each, argument, form, there, is, a, corresponding, statement, form, called, a, corresponding, conditional, and, an, argument, form, is, valid, if, and, only, if, its, corresponding, conditional, is, a, logical, truth, a, statement, form, which, is, logically, true, is, also, said, to, be, a, valid, statement, form, a, statement, form, is, a, logical, truth, if, it, is, true, under, all, interpretations, a, statement, form, can, be, shown, to, be, a, logical, truth, by, either, a, showing, that, it, is, a, tautology, or, b, by, means, of, a, proof, procedure, the, corresponding, conditional, of, a, valid, argument, is, a, necessary, truth, true, in, all, possible, worlds, and, so, the, conclusion, necessarily, follows, from, the, premises, or, follows, of, logical, necessity, the, conclusion, of, a, valid, argument, is, not, necessarily, true, it, depends, on, whether, the, premises, are, true, if, the, conclusion, itself, is, a, necessary, truth, it, is, without, regard, to, the, premises, some, examples, in, the, above, second, to, last, case, some, men, are, hawkers, the, counter, example, follows, the, same, logical, form, as, the, previous, argument, premise, 1, some, x, are, y, premise, 2, some, y, are, z, conclusion, some, x, are, z, in, order, to, demonstrate, that, whatever, hawkers, may, be, they, may, or, may, not, be, rich, in, consideration, of, the, premises, as, such, see, also, existential, import, the, forms, of, argument, that, render, deductions, valid, are, well, established, however, some, invalid, arguments, can, also, be, persuasive, depending, on, their, construction, inductive, arguments, for, example, see, also, formal, fallacy, and, informal, fallacy, an, argument, is, sound, when, the, argument, is, valid, and, argument, s, premise, s, is, are, true, therefore, the, conclusion, is, true, an, inductive, argument, asserts, that, the, truth, of, the, conclusion, is, supported, by, the, probability, of, the, premises, for, example, given, that, the, military, budget, of, the, united, states, is, the, largest, in, the, world, premise, true, then, it, is, probable, that, it, will, remain, so, for, the, next, 10, years, conclusion, true, arguments, that, involve, predictions, are, inductive, since, the, future, is, uncertain, an, inductive, argument, is, said, to, be, strong, or, weak, if, the, premises, of, an, inductive, argument, are, assumed, true, is, it, probable, the, conclusion, is, also, true, if, yes, the, argument, is, strong, if, no, it, is, weak, a, strong, argument, is, said, to, be, cogent, if, it, has, all, true, premises, otherwise, the, argument, is, uncogent, the, military, budget, argument, example, is, a, strong, cogent, argument, non, deductive, logic, is, reasoning, using, arguments, in, which, the, premises, support, the, conclusion, but, do, not, entail, it, forms, of, non, deductive, logic, include, the, statistical, syllogism, which, argues, from, generalizations, true, for, the, most, part, and, induction, a, form, of, reasoning, that, makes, generalizations, based, on, individual, instances, an, inductive, argument, is, said, to, be, cogent, if, and, only, if, the, truth, of, the, argument, s, premises, would, render, the, truth, of, the, conclusion, probable, i, e, the, argument, is, strong, and, the, argument, s, premises, are, in, fact, true, cogency, can, be, considered, inductive, logic, s, analogue, to, deductive, logic, s, soundness, despite, its, name, mathematical, induction, is, not, a, form, of, inductive, reasoning, the, lack, of, deductive, validity, is, known, as, the, problem, of, induction, in, modern, argumentation, theories, arguments, are, regarded, as, defeasible, passages, from, premises, to, a, conclusion, defeasibility, means, that, when, additional, information, new, evidence, or, contrary, arguments, is, provided, the, premises, may, be, no, longer, lead, to, the, conclusion, non, monotonic, reasoning, this, type, of, reasoning, is, referred, to, as, defeasible, reasoning, for, instance, we, consider, the, famous, tweety, example, this, argument, is, reasonable, and, the, premises, support, the, conclusion, unless, additional, information, indicating, that, the, case, is, an, exception, comes, in, if, tweety, is, a, penguin, the, inference, is, no, longer, justified, by, the, premise, defeasible, arguments, are, based, on, generalizations, that, hold, only, in, the, majority, of, cases, but, are, subject, to, exceptions, and, defaults, in, order, to, represent, and, assess, defeasible, reasoning, it, is, necessary, to, combine, the, logical, rules, governing, the, acceptance, of, a, conclusion, based, on, the, acceptance, of, its, premises, with, rules, of, material, inference, governing, how, a, premise, can, support, a, given, conclusion, whether, it, is, reasonable, or, not, to, draw, a, specific, conclusion, from, a, specific, description, of, a, state, of, affairs, argumentation, schemes, have, been, developed, to, describe, and, assess, the, acceptability, or, the, fallaciousness, of, defeasible, arguments, argumentation, schemes, are, stereotypical, patterns, of, inference, combining, semantic, ontological, relations, with, types, of, reasoning, and, logical, axioms, and, representing, the, abstract, structure, of, the, most, common, types, of, natural, arguments, a, typical, example, is, the, argument, from, expert, opinion, shown, below, which, has, two, premises, and, a, conclusion, each, scheme, may, be, associated, with, a, set, of, critical, questions, namely, criteria, for, assessing, dialectically, the, reasonableness, and, acceptability, of, an, argument, the, matching, critical, questions, are, the, standard, ways, of, casting, the, argument, into, doubt, argument, by, analogy, may, be, thought, of, as, argument, from, the, particular, to, particular, an, argument, by, analogy, may, use, a, particular, truth, in, a, premise, to, argue, towards, a, similar, particular, truth, in, the, conclusion, for, example, if, a, plato, was, mortal, and, b, socrates, was, like, plato, in, other, respects, then, asserting, that, c, socrates, was, mortal, is, an, example, of, argument, by, analogy, because, the, reasoning, employed, in, it, proceeds, from, a, particular, truth, in, a, premise, plato, was, mortal, to, a, similar, particular, truth, in, the, conclusion, namely, that, socrates, was, mortal, other, kinds, of, arguments, may, have, different, or, additional, standards, of, validity, or, justification, for, example, philosopher, charles, taylor, said, that, so, called, transcendental, arguments, are, made, up, of, a, chain, of, indispensability, claims, that, attempt, to, show, why, something, is, necessarily, true, based, on, its, connection, to, our, experience, while, nikolas, kompridis, has, suggested, that, there, are, two, types, of, fallible, arguments, one, based, on, truth, claims, and, the, other, based, on, the, time, responsive, disclosure, of, possibility, world, disclosure, kompridis, said, that, the, french, philosopher, michel, foucault, was, a, prominent, advocate, of, this, latter, form, of, philosophical, argument, world, disclosing, arguments, are, a, group, of, philosophical, arguments, that, according, to, nikolas, kompridis, employ, a, disclosive, approach, to, reveal, features, of, a, wider, ontological, or, cultural, linguistic, understanding, a, world, in, a, specifically, ontological, sense, in, order, to, clarify, or, transform, the, background, of, meaning, tacit, knowledge, and, what, kompridis, has, called, the, logical, space, on, which, an, argument, implicitly, depends, while, arguments, attempt, to, show, that, something, was, is, will, be, or, should, be, the, case, explanations, try, to, show, why, or, how, something, is, or, will, be, if, fred, and, joe, address, the, issue, of, whether, or, not, fred, s, cat, has, fleas, joe, may, state, fred, your, cat, has, fleas, observe, the, cat, is, scratching, right, now, joe, has, made, an, argument, that, the, cat, has, fleas, however, if, joe, asks, fred, why, is, your, cat, scratching, itself, the, explanation, because, it, has, fleas, provides, understanding, both, the, above, argument, and, explanation, require, knowing, the, generalities, that, a, fleas, often, cause, itching, and, b, that, one, often, scratches, to, relieve, itching, the, difference, is, in, the, intent, an, argument, attempts, to, settle, whether, or, not, some, claim, is, true, and, an, explanation, attempts, to, provide, understanding, of, the, event, note, that, by, subsuming, the, specific, event, of, fred, s, cat, scratching, as, an, instance, of, the, general, rule, that, animals, scratch, themselves, when, they, have, fleas, joe, will, no, longer, wonder, why, fred, s, cat, is, scratching, itself, arguments, address, problems, of, belief, explanations, address, problems, of, understanding, in, the, argument, above, the, statement, fred, s, cat, has, fleas, is, up, for, debate, i, e, is, a, claim, but, in, the, explanation, the, statement, fred, s, cat, has, fleas, is, assumed, to, be, true, unquestioned, at, this, time, and, just, needs, explaining, arguments, and, explanations, largely, resemble, each, other, in, rhetorical, use, this, is, the, cause, of, much, difficulty, in, thinking, critically, about, claims, there, are, several, reasons, for, this, difficulty, explanations, and, arguments, are, often, studied, in, the, field, of, information, systems, to, help, explain, user, acceptance, of, knowledge, based, systems, certain, argument, types, may, fit, better, with, personality, traits, to, enhance, acceptance, by, individuals, fallacies, are, types, of, argument, or, expressions, which, are, held, to, be, of, an, invalid, form, or, contain, errors, in, reasoning, one, type, of, fallacy, occurs, when, a, word, frequently, used, to, indicate, a, conclusion, is, used, as, a, transition, conjunctive, adverb, between, independent, clauses, in, english, the, words, therefore, so, because, and, hence, typically, separate, the, premises, from, the, conclusion, of, an, argument, thus, socrates, is, a, man, all, men, are, mortal, therefore, socrates, is, mortal, is, an, argument, because, the, assertion, socrates, is, mortal, follows, from, the, preceding, statements, however, i, was, thirsty, and, therefore, i, drank, is, not, an, argument, despite, its, appearance, it, is, not, being, claimed, that, i, drank, is, logically, entailed, by, i, was, thirsty, the, therefore, in, this, sentence, indicates, for, that, reason, not, it, follows, that, often, an, argument, is, invalid, or, weak, because, there, is, a, missing, premise, the, supply, of, which, would, make, it, valid, or, strong, this, is, referred, to, as, an, elliptical, or, enthymematic, argument, see, also, enthymeme, syllogism, with, an, unstated, premise, speakers, and, writers, will, often, leave, out, a, necessary, premise, in, their, reasoning, if, it, is, widely, accepted, and, the, writer, does, not, wish, to, state, the, blindingly, obvious, example, all, metals, expand, when, heated, therefore, iron, will, expand, when, heated, the, missing, premise, is, iron, is, a, metal, on, the, other, hand, a, seemingly, valid, argument, may, be, found, to, lack, a, premise, a, hidden, assumption, which, if, highlighted, can, show, a, fault, in, reasoning, example, a, witness, reasoned, nobody, came, out, the, front, door, except, the, milkman, therefore, the, murderer, must, have, left, by, the, back, door, the, hidden, assumptions, are, 1, the, milkman, was, not, the, murderer, and, 2, the, murderer, has, left, 3, by, a, door, and, 4, not, by, e, g, a, window, or, through, an, ole, in, t, roof, and, 5, there, are, no, other, doors, than, the, front, or, back, door, the, goal, of, argument, mining, is, the, automatic, extraction, and, identification, of, argumentative, structures, from, natural, language, text, with, the, aid, of, computer, programs, such, argumentative, structures, include, the, premise, conclusions, the, argument, scheme, and, the, relationship, between, the, main, and, subsidiary, argument, or, the, main, and, counter, argument, within, discourse
