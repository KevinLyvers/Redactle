professions, as, minerva, medica, she, could, also, be, thought, of, as, a, healing, goddess, the, epigraphic, evidence, present, makes, it, clear, that, this, is, how, minerva, was, thought, of, in, bath, some, of, the, archaeological, evidence, present, in, bath, leads, scholars, to, believe, that, it, was, thought, minerva, could, provide, full, healing, from, things, such, as, rheumatism, via, the, hot, springs, if, she, was, given, full, credit, for, the, healing, the, temple, of, sulis, minerva, was, known, for, having, a, miraculous, altar, fire, that, burned, coal, as, opposed, to, the,

shrine, dedicated, to, minerva, in, edgar, s, field, built, in, the, face, of, a, quarry, next, to, the, river, dee, stemming, from, an, italic, moon, goddess, menesw, she, who, measures, the, etruscans, adopted, the, inherited, old, latin, name, menerw, thereby, calling, her, menrva, it, is, presumed, that, her, roman, name, minerva, is, based, on, this, etruscan, mythology, minerva, was, the, goddess, of, wisdom, war, art, schools, justice, and, commerce, she, was, the, etruscan, counterpart, to, greek, athena, like, athena, minerva, burst, from, the, head, of, her, father, jupiter, greek, zeus, who, had, devoured, her, mother, metis, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, prevent, her, birth, by, a, process, of, folk, etymology, the, romans, could, have, linked, her, foreign, name, to, the, root, men, in, latin, words, such, as, mens, meaning, mind, perhaps, because, one, of, her, aspects, as, goddess, pertained, to, the, intellectual, the, word, mens, is, built, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, men, mind, linked, with, memory, as, in, greek, mnemosyne, and, mnestis, memory, remembrance, recollection, manush, in, sanskrit, meaning, mind, the, etruscan, menrva,
