solomon, s, l, m, n, also, called, jedidiah, was, a, monarch, of, ancient, israel, and, the, son, and, successor, of, king, david, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, or, old, testament, he, is, described, as, having, been, the, penultimate, ruler, of, an, amalgamated, israel, and, judah, the, hypothesized, dates, of, solomon, s, reign, are, from, 970, to, 931, bce, according, to, the, bible, after, his, death, his, son, and, successor, rehoboam, adopted, a, harsh, policy, towards, the, northern, tribes, eventually, leading, to, the, splitting, of, the, israelites, between, the, kingdom, of, israel, in, the, north, and, the, kingdom, of, judah, in, the, south, following, the, split, the, biblical, narrative, depicts, his, patrilineal, descendants, ruling, over, judah, alone, the, bible, says, solomon, built, the, first, temple, in, jerusalem, dedicating, the, temple, to, yahweh, or, god, solomon, is, portrayed, as, wealthy, wise, and, powerful, and, as, one, of, the, 48, jewish, prophets, he, is, also, the, subject, of, many, later, references, and, legends, most, notably, in, the, testament, of, solomon, part, of, first, century, biblical, apocrypha, the, historicity, of, solomon, is, hotly, debated, current, consensus, allows, for, a, historical, solomon, but, regards, his, reign, as, king, over, israel, and, judah, in, the, tenth, century, bce, as, uncertain, and, the, biblical, description, of, his, apparent, empire, s, lavishness, as, most, probably, an, anachronistic, exaggeration, in, the, new, testament, he, is, portrayed, as, a, teacher, of, wisdom, excelled, by, jesus, of, nazareth, and, as, arrayed, in, glory, but, excelled, by, the, lilies, of, the, field, in, the, quran, he, is, considered, to, be, a, major, islamic, prophet, in, mostly, non, biblical, circles, solomon, also, came, to, be, known, as, a, magician, and, an, exorcist, with, numerous, amulets, and, medallion, seals, dating, from, the, hellenistic, period, invoking, his, name, the, life, of, solomon, is, primarily, described, in, 2, samuel, 1, kings, and, 2, chronicles, his, two, names, are, traditionally, taken, to, mean, peaceful, and, friend, of, god, both, considered, predictive, of, the, character, of, his, reign, a, 2023, textbook, described, three, possibilities, for, the, etymology, of, solomon, s, name, compensation, or, a, substitute, the, ruler, of, peace, or, based, on, the, deified, evening, star, shalim, the, conventional, dates, of, solomon, s, reign, are, derived, from, biblical, chronology, and, are, set, from, about, 970, to, 931, bce, regarding, the, davidic, dynasty, to, which, king, solomon, belongs, its, chronology, can, be, checked, against, datable, babylonian, and, assyrian, records, at, a, few, points, and, these, correspondences, have, allowed, archaeologists, to, date, its, kings, in, a, modern, framework, according, to, the, most, widely, used, chronology, based, on, that, by, the, old, testament, professor, edwin, r, thiele, the, death, of, solomon, and, the, division, of, his, kingdom, would, have, occurred, in, the, fall, of, 931, bce, solomon, was, born, in, jerusalem, the, second, born, child, of, david, and, his, wife, bathsheba, widow, of, uriah, the, hittite, the, first, child, unnamed, in, that, account, a, son, conceived, adulterously, during, uriah, s, lifetime, had, died, seven, days, after, birth, it, is, suggested, in, scripture, that, this, was, a, judgment, from, god, solomon, had, three, named, full, brothers, born, to, bathsheba, nathan, shammua, and, shobab, besides, six, known, older, half, brothers, born, of, as, many, mothers, the, biblical, narrative, shows, that, solomon, served, as, a, peace, offering, between, god, and, david, due, to, david, s, adulterous, relationship, with, bathsheba, in, an, effort, to, hide, this, sin, david, sent, bathsheba, s, husband, uriah, the, hittite, to, battle, and, specifically, to, the, front, line, wherein, david, ordered, the, commanding, officer, joab, to, withdraw, support, for, uriah, in, order, to, have, him, killed, in, battle, by, the, enemy, after, he, died, david, was, finally, able, to, marry, bathsheba, as, punishment, the, first, child, who, was, conceived, during, the, adulterous, relationship, died, solomon, was, born, after, david, was, forgiven, it, is, this, reason, why, his, name, which, means, peace, was, chosen, some, historians, cited, that, nathan, the, prophet, brought, up, solomon, as, his, father, was, busy, governing, the, realm, this, could, also, be, attributed, to, the, notion, that, the, prophet, held, great, influence, over, david, because, he, knew, of, his, adultery, which, was, considered, a, grievous, offense, under, the, mosaic, law, according, to, the, first, book, of, kings, when, david, was, old, he, could, not, get, warm, so, they, sought, a, beautiful, young, woman, throughout, all, the, territory, of, israel, and, found, abishag, the, shunamite, and, brought, her, to, the, king, the, young, woman, was, very, beautiful, and, she, was, of, service, to, the, king, and, attended, to, him, but, the, king, knew, her, not, while, david, was, in, this, state, court, factions, were, maneuvering, for, power, adonijah, david, s, heir, apparent, acted, to, have, himself, declared, king, but, was, outmaneuvered, by, bathsheba, and, the, biblical, prophet, nathan, who, convinced, david, to, proclaim, solomon, king, according, to, his, earlier, promise, not, recorded, elsewhere, in, the, biblical, narrative, despite, solomon, s, being, younger, than, his, brothers, solomon, as, instructed, by, david, began, his, reign, with, an, extensive, purge, including, his, father, s, chief, general, joab, among, others, and, further, consolidated, his, position, by, appointing, friends, throughout, the, administration, including, in, religious, positions, as, well, as, in, civic, and, military, posts, it, is, said, that, solomon, ascended, to, the, throne, when, he, was, only, about, fifteen, solomon, greatly, expanded, his, military, strength, especially, the, cavalry, and, chariot, arms, he, founded, numerous, colonies, some, of, which, doubled, as, trading, posts, and, military, outposts, trade, relationships, were, a, focus, of, his, administration, in, particular, he, continued, his, father, s, very, profitable, relationship, with, the, phoenician, king, hiram, i, of, tyre, see, wealth, below, they, sent, out, joint, expeditions, to, the, lands, of, tarshish, and, ophir, to, engage, in, the, trade, of, luxury, products, importing, gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes, and, peacocks, solomon, is, considered, the, most, wealthy, of, the, israelite, kings, named, in, the, bible, solomon, was, the, biblical, king, most, famous, for, his, wisdom, in, 1, kings, he, sacrificed, to, god, and, god, later, appeared, to, him, in, a, dream, asking, what, solomon, wanted, from, god, solomon, asked, for, wisdom, in, order, to, better, rule, and, guide, his, people, pleased, god, personally, answered, solomon, s, prayer, promising, him, great, wisdom, because, he, did, not, ask, for, self, serving, rewards, like, long, life, or, the, death, of, his, enemies, perhaps, the, best, known, story, of, his, wisdom, is, the, judgement, of, solomon, two, women, each, lay, claim, to, being, the, mother, of, the, same, child, solomon, easily, resolved, the, dispute, by, commanding, the, child, to, be, cut, in, half, and, shared, between, the, two, one, woman, promptly, renounced, her, claim, proving, that, she, would, rather, give, the, child, up, than, see, it, killed, solomon, declared, the, woman, who, showed, compassion, to, be, the, true, mother, entitled, to, the, whole, child, solomon, has, traditionally, been, considered, the, author, of, several, biblical, books, including, proverbs, ecclesiastes, and, song, of, songs, he, is, traditionally, ascribed, authorship, of, the, wisdom, of, solomon, which, is, included, in, the, scriptures, of, the, eastern, orthodox, and, catholic, church, but, is, considered, apocryphal, in, protestant, traditions, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, the, ancient, kingdom, of, israel, gained, its, highest, splendour, and, wealth, during, solomon, s, reign, of, 40, years, in, a, single, year, according, to, 1, kings, 10, 14, solomon, collected, tribute, amounting, to, 666, talents, 18, 125, kilograms, of, gold, solomon, is, described, as, surrounding, himself, with, all, the, luxuries, and, the, grandeur, of, an, eastern, monarch, and, his, government, prospered, he, entered, into, an, alliance, with, hiram, i, king, of, tyre, who, in, many, ways, greatly, assisted, him, in, his, numerous, undertakings, for, some, years, before, his, death, david, was, engaged, in, collecting, materials, for, building, a, temple, in, jerusalem, as, a, permanent, home, for, yahweh, and, the, ark, of, the, covenant, solomon, is, described, as, undertaking, the, construction, of, the, temple, with, the, help, of, an, architect, also, named, hiram, and, other, materials, sent, from, king, hiram, of, tyre, after, the, completion, of, the, temple, solomon, is, described, in, the, biblical, narrative, as, erecting, many, other, buildings, of, importance, in, jerusalem, for, 13, years, he, was, engaged, in, the, building, of, a, royal, palace, on, ophel, a, hilly, promontory, in, central, jerusalem, this, complex, included, buildings, referred, to, as, solomon, s, throne, is, said, to, have, been, spectacularly, opulent, and, possessed, moving, parts, making, it, one, of, the, earliest, mechanical, devices, in, history, it, is, said, that, nothing, like, it, the, throne, had, ever, been, made, for, any, other, kingdom, solomon, also, constructed, great, water, works, for, the, city, and, the, millo, septuagint, acra, for, the, defense, of, the, city, however, excavations, of, jerusalem, have, discovered, no, monumental, architecture, from, the, era, and, no, remains, of, either, the, temple, or, solomon, s, palace, have, been, found, solomon, is, also, described, as, rebuilding, cities, elsewhere, in, israel, creating, the, port, of, ezion, geber, and, constructing, palmyra, in, the, wilderness, as, a, commercial, depot, and, military, outpost, although, the, location, of, the, port, of, ezion, geber, is, known, no, remains, have, ever, been, found, more, archaeological, success, has, been, achieved, with, the, major, cities, solomon, is, said, to, have, strengthened, or, rebuilt, for, example, hazor, megiddo, and, gezer, these, all, have, substantial, ancient, remains, including, impressive, six, chambered, gates, and, ashlar, palaces, however, it, is, no, longer, the, scholarly, consensus, that, these, structures, date, to, the, time, according, to, the, bible, when, solomon, ruled, according, to, the, bible, during, solomon, s, reign, israel, enjoyed, great, commercial, prosperity, with, extensive, traffic, being, carried, on, by, land, with, tyre, egypt, and, arabia, and, by, sea, with, tarshish, ophir, and, south, india, according, to, the, biblical, account, solomon, had, 700, wives, and, 300, concubines, the, wives, were, described, as, foreign, princesses, including, pharaoh, s, daughter, and, women, of, moab, ammon, edom, sidon, and, of, the, hittites, his, marriage, to, pharaoh, s, daughter, appears, to, have, cemented, a, political, alliance, with, egypt, whereas, he, clung, to, his, other, wives, and, concubines, in, love, the, only, wife, mentioned, by, name, is, naamah, the, ammonite, mother, of, solomon, s, successor, rehoboam, the, biblical, narrative, notes, with, disapproval, that, solomon, permitted, his, foreign, wives, to, import, their, national, deities, building, temples, to, ashtoreth, and, milcom, in, the, branch, of, literary, analysis, that, examines, the, bible, called, higher, criticism, the, story, of, solomon, falling, into, idolatry, by, the, influence, of, pharaoh, s, daughter, and, his, other, foreign, wives, is, customarily, seen, as, the, handiwork, of, the, deuteronomistic, historian, s, who, are, held, to, have, written, compiled, or, edited, texts, to, legitimize, the, reforms, of, hezekiah, s, great, grandson, king, josiah, who, reigned, from, about, 641, to, 609, bce, over, 280, years, after, solomon, s, death, according, to, bible, scholars, scholarly, consensus, in, this, field, holds, that, solomon, s, wives, women, were, introduced, in, the, josianic, customarily, dtr, edition, of, kings, as, a, theological, construct, to, blame, the, schism, on, his, misdeeds, in, a, brief, unelaborated, and, enigmatic, passage, the, hebrew, bible, describes, how, the, fame, of, solomon, s, wisdom, and, wealth, reached, even, the, far, off, queen, of, sheba, the, queen, is, described, as, visiting, with, gifts, including, gold, spices, and, precious, stones, when, solomon, gave, her, all, her, desire, whatsoever, she, asked, she, left, satisfied, 1, kings, 10, 13, whether, the, passage, is, simply, to, provide, a, brief, foreign, witness, of, solomon, s, wealth, and, wisdom, or, whether, the, visit, is, meant, to, have, more, significance, is, unknown, nevertheless, the, queen, of, sheba, has, become, the, subject, of, numerous, stories, sheba, is, typically, identified, as, saba, a, nation, once, spanning, the, red, sea, on, the, coasts, of, what, are, now, eritrea, somalia, ethiopia, and, yemen, in, arabia, felix, although, other, sources, place, it, in, the, area, of, what, is, now, northern, ethiopia, and, eritrea, in, a, rabbinical, account, e, g, targum, sheni, colloquy, of, the, queen, of, sheba, solomon, was, accustomed, to, ordering, animals, to, dance, before, him, a, power, granted, by, god, and, upon, summoning, the, mountain, cock, or, hoopoe, aramaic, name, nagar, tura, the, bird, told, him, it, had, discovered, a, land, in, the, east, rich, in, gold, silver, and, plants, whose, capital, was, called, kitor, and, whose, ruler, was, the, queen, of, sheba, solomon, then, sent, the, bird, to, request, the, queen, s, visit, an, ethiopian, account, from, the, 14th, century, kebra, nagast, maintains, that, the, queen, of, sheba, had, sexual, relations, with, king, solomon, and, gave, birth, beside, the, mai, bella, stream, in, the, province, of, hamasien, eritrea, the, ethiopian, tradition, has, a, detailed, account, of, the, affair, the, child, was, a, son, who, became, menelik, i, king, of, axum, and, founded, a, dynasty, that, would, reign, as, the, jewish, then, christian, empire, of, ethiopia, which, lasted, 2900, years, until, haile, selassie, was, overthrown, in, 1974, menelik, was, said, to, be, a, practicing, jew, who, was, given, a, replica, of, the, ark, of, the, covenant, by, king, solomon, and, moreover, that, the, original, ark, was, switched, and, went, to, axum, with, him, and, his, mother, and, is, still, there, guarded, by, a, single, dedicated, priest, the, claim, of, such, a, lineage, and, of, possession, of, the, ark, was, an, important, source, of, legitimacy, and, prestige, for, the, ethiopian, monarchy, through, the, centuries, and, had, important, and, lasting, effects, on, ethiopian, culture, the, ethiopian, government, and, church, deny, all, requests, to, view, the, alleged, ark, some, classical, era, rabbis, attacking, solomon, s, moral, character, have, claimed, instead, that, the, child, was, an, ancestor, of, nebuchadnezzar, ii, who, destroyed, solomon, s, temple, some, 300, years, later, jewish, scribes, say, that, solomon, s, teacher, was, shimei, ben, gera, and, while, he, lived, he, prevented, solomon, from, marrying, foreign, wives, the, talmud, says, at, ber, 8a, for, as, long, as, shimei, the, son, of, gera, was, alive, solomon, did, not, marry, the, daughter, of, pharaoh, see, also, midrash, tehillim, to, ps, 3, 1, solomon, s, execution, of, shimei, was, his, first, descent, into, sin, according, to, 1, kings, 11, 4, solomon, s, wives, turned, his, heart, after, other, gods, their, own, national, deities, to, whom, solomon, built, temples, thus, incurring, divine, anger, and, retribution, in, the, form, of, the, division, of, the, kingdom, after, solomon, s, death, 1, kings, 11, 9, 13, 1, kings, 11, describes, solomon, s, descent, into, idolatry, particularly, his, turning, after, ashtoreth, the, goddess, of, the, sidonians, and, after, milcom, the, god, of, the, ammonites, in, deuteronomy, 17, 16, 17, a, king, is, commanded, not, to, multiply, horses, or, wives, neither, greatly, multiply, to, himself, gold, or, silver, solomon, sinned, in, all, three, of, these, areas, in, addition, to, his, wives, he, collected, 666, talents, of, gold, each, year, 1, kings, 10, 14, a, huge, amount, for, a, small, nation, like, israel, he, gathered, multitudes, of, horses, and, chariots, from, as, far, as, egypt, and, as, deuteronomy, 17, warns, took, israel, back, to, egypt, in, spirit, according, to, 1, kings, 11, 30, 34, and, 1, kings, 11, 9, 13, it, was, because, of, these, sins, that, the, lord, punished, solomon, by, removing, most, of, the, tribes, of, israel, from, rule, by, solomon, s, house, and, the, lord, was, angry, with, solomon, because, his, heart, had, turned, away, from, the, lord, the, god, of, israel, who, had, appeared, to, him, twice, and, had, commanded, him, concerning, this, thing, that, he, should, not, go, after, other, gods, but, he, did, not, keep, what, the, lord, commanded, therefore, the, lord, said, to, solomon, since, this, has, been, your, practice, and, you, have, not, kept, my, covenant, and, my, statutes, that, i, have, commanded, you, i, will, surely, tear, the, kingdom, from, you, and, will, give, it, to, your, servant, yet, for, the, sake, of, david, your, father, i, will, not, do, it, in, your, days, but, i, will, tear, it, out, of, the, hand, of, your, son, however, i, will, not, tear, away, all, the, kingdom, but, i, will, give, one, tribe, to, your, son, for, the, sake, of, david, my, servant, and, for, the, sake, of, jerusalem, that, i, have, chosen, near, the, end, of, his, life, solomon, was, beset, by, several, enemies, including, hadad, of, edom, rezon, of, zobah, and, his, own, official, jeroboam, of, the, tribe, of, ephraim, king, solomon, is, a, central, biblical, figure, who, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, was, the, builder, of, the, first, temple, in, jerusalem, and, the, last, ruler, of, the, united, kingdom, of, israel, after, a, reign, of, forty, years, 1, kings, 11, 42, he, died, of, natural, causes, at, around, 55, years, of, age, upon, solomon, s, death, his, son, rehoboam, succeeded, him, but, ten, of, the, tribes, of, israel, refused, him, as, king, splitting, the, monarchy, into, the, northern, kingdom, of, israel, under, jeroboam, while, rehoboam, continued, to, reign, over, the, smaller, southern, kingdom, of, judah, henceforth, the, two, kingdoms, were, never, again, united, solomon, is, associated, with, the, peak, golden, age, of, the, independent, kingdom, of, israel, and, is, a, legendary, source, of, judicial, and, religious, wisdom, according, to, jewish, tradition, king, solomon, wrote, three, books, of, the, bible, the, hebrew, word, appears, in, the, title, of, two, hymns, 72, and, 127, in, the, psalms, this, hebrew, word, means, to, solomon, but, it, can, also, be, translated, as, by, solomon, thus, suggesting, to, some, that, solomon, wrote, the, two, psalms, rabbinical, tradition, attributes, the, book, of, wisdom, included, within, the, septuagint, to, solomon, although, this, book, was, probably, written, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, in, this, work, solomon, is, portrayed, as, an, astronomer, other, books, of, wisdom, poetry, such, as, the, odes, of, solomon, and, the, psalms, of, solomon, also, bear, his, name, the, jewish, historian, eupolemus, who, wrote, about, 157, bce, included, copies, of, apocryphal, letters, exchanged, between, solomon, and, the, kings, of, egypt, and, tyre, the, gnostic, apocalypse, of, adam, which, may, date, to, the, 1st, or, 2nd, century, refers, to, a, legend, in, which, solomon, sends, out, an, army, of, demons, to, seek, a, virgin, who, had, fled, from, him, perhaps, the, earliest, surviving, mention, of, the, later, common, tale, that, solomon, controlled, demons, and, made, them, his, slaves, this, tradition, of, solomon, s, control, over, demons, appears, fully, elaborated, in, the, early, pseudoepigraphical, work, called, the, testament, of, solomon, with, its, elaborate, and, grotesque, demonology, as, with, most, biblical, personages, in, the, middle, era, of, israelite, society, the, historicity, of, solomon, is, hotly, debated, current, consensus, states, that, regardless, of, whether, or, not, a, man, named, solomon, truly, reigned, as, king, over, the, judean, hills, in, the, tenth, century, bce, the, biblical, description, of, his, apparent, empire, s, lavishness, is, almost, surely, an, anachronistic, exaggeration, as, for, solomon, himself, scholars, on, both, the, maximalist, and, minimalist, sides, of, the, spectrum, of, biblical, archeology, generally, agree, that, he, probably, existed, however, a, historically, accurate, picture, of, the, davidic, king, is, difficult, to, construct, according, to, some, archaeologists, solomon, could, have, only, been, the, monarch, or, chieftain, of, judah, and, that, the, northern, kingdom, was, a, separate, development, such, positions, have, been, criticized, by, other, archaeologists, and, scholars, who, argue, that, a, united, monarchy, did, exist, in, the, 10th, century, bce, while, agreeing, that, the, biblical, account, contains, exaggerations, historical, evidence, of, king, solomon, other, than, the, biblical, accounts, has, been, so, minimal, that, some, scholars, have, understood, the, period, of, his, reign, as, a, dark, age, muhly, 1998, the, first, century, romano, jewish, scholar, josephus, in, against, apion, citing, tyrian, court, records, and, menander, gives, a, specific, year, during, which, king, hiram, i, of, tyre, sent, materials, to, solomon, for, the, construction, of, the, temple, however, no, material, evidence, indisputably, of, solomon, s, reign, has, been, found, yigael, yadin, s, excavations, at, hazor, megiddo, beit, shean, and, gezer, uncovered, structures, that, he, and, others, have, argued, date, from, solomon, s, reign, but, others, such, as, israel, finkelstein, and, neil, silberman, argue, that, they, should, be, dated, to, the, omride, period, more, than, a, century, after, solomon, according, to, finkelstein, and, silberman, authors, of, the, bible, unearthed, archaeology, s, new, vision, of, ancient, israel, and, the, origin, of, its, sacred, texts, at, the, time, of, the, kingdoms, of, david, and, solomon, jerusalem, was, populated, by, only, a, few, hundred, residents, or, less, which, is, insufficient, for, an, empire, stretching, from, the, euphrates, to, eilath, according, to, the, bible, unearthed, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, kingdom, of, israel, at, the, time, of, solomon, was, little, more, than, a, small, city, state, and, so, it, is, implausible, that, solomon, received, tribute, as, large, as, 666, talents, of, gold, per, year, although, both, finkelstein, and, silberman, accept, that, david, and, solomon, were, real, inhabitants, of, judah, about, the, 10th, century, bce, they, claim, that, the, earliest, independent, reference, to, the, kingdom, of, israel, is, about, 890, bce, and, for, judah, about, 750, bce, they, suggest, that, because, of, religious, prejudice, the, authors, of, the, bible, suppressed, the, achievements, of, the, omrides, whom, the, hebrew, bible, describes, as, being, polytheist, and, instead, pushed, them, back, to, a, supposed, golden, age, of, judaism, and, monotheists, and, devotees, of, yahweh, some, biblical, minimalists, like, thomas, l, thompson, go, further, arguing, that, jerusalem, became, a, city, and, capable, of, being, a, state, capital, only, in, the, mid, 7th, century, likewise, finkelstein, and, others, consider, the, claimed, size, of, solomon, s, temple, implausible, andr, lemaire, states, in, ancient, israel, from, abraham, to, the, roman, destruction, of, the, temple, that, the, principal, points, of, the, biblical, tradition, of, solomon, are, generally, trustworthy, although, elsewhere, he, writes, that, he, could, find, no, substantiating, archaeological, evidence, that, supports, the, queen, of, sheba, s, visit, to, king, solomon, saying, that, the, earliest, records, of, trans, arabian, caravan, voyages, from, tayma, and, sheba, unto, the, middle, euphrates, etc, occurred, in, the, mid, 8th, century, bce, placing, a, possible, visit, from, the, queen, of, sheba, to, jerusalem, around, this, time, some, 250, years, later, than, the, timeframe, traditionally, given, for, king, solomon, s, reign, seventeen, years, later, traces, of, cinnamon, were, found, in, phoenician, clay, flasks, from, three, small, sites, in, the, israeli, coastal, plain, dating, from, the, 10th, century, bce, the, authors, suggested, that, trade, routes, with, south, asia, existed, much, earlier, than, previously, thought, kenneth, kitchen, argues, that, solomon, ruled, over, a, comparatively, wealthy, mini, empire, rather, than, a, small, city, state, and, considers, 666, gold, talents, a, modest, amount, of, money, kitchen, calculates, that, over, 30, years, such, a, kingdom, might, have, accumulated, up, to, 500, tons, of, gold, which, is, small, compared, to, other, examples, such, as, the, 1, 180, tons, of, gold, that, alexander, the, great, took, from, susa, similarly, kitchen, and, others, consider, the, temple, of, solomon, a, reasonable, and, typically, sized, structure, for, the, region, at, the, time, dever, states, that, we, now, have, direct, bronze, and, iron, age, parallels, for, every, feature, of, the, solomonic, temple, as, described, in, the, hebrew, bible, some, scholars, have, charted, a, middle, path, between, minimalist, scholars, like, finkelstein, silberman, and, philip, davies, who, believes, that, solomon, is, a, totally, invented, character, and, maximalist, scholars, like, lemaire, and, kitchen, for, instance, the, archaeologist, avraham, faust, has, argued, that, biblical, depictions, of, solomon, date, to, later, periods, and, do, overstate, his, wealth, buildings, and, kingdom, but, that, solomon, did, have, an, acropolis, and, ruled, over, a, polity, larger, than, jerusalem, in, particular, his, archaeological, research, in, regions, near, jerusalem, like, sharon, finds, commerce, too, great, not, to, be, supported, by, a, polity, and, such, regions, probably, were, ruled, loosely, by, jerusalem, scholars, like, lester, grabbe, also, believe, that, there, must, have, been, a, ruler, in, jerusalem, during, this, period, and, that, he, likely, built, a, temple, although, the, town, was, quite, small, william, g, dever, argues, that, solomon, only, reigned, over, israel, and, did, build, a, temple, but, that, descriptions, of, his, lavishness, and, the, other, conquests, are, strongly, exaggerated, the, archaeological, remains, that, are, considered, to, date, from, the, time, of, solomon, are, notable, for, the, fact, that, canaanite, material, culture, appears, to, have, continued, unabated, there, is, a, distinct, lack, of, magnificent, empire, or, cultural, development, indeed, comparing, pottery, from, areas, traditionally, assigned, to, israel, with, that, of, the, philistines, points, to, the, latter, having, been, significantly, more, sophisticated, however, there, is, a, lack, of, physical, evidence, of, its, existence, despite, some, archaeological, work, in, the, area, this, is, not, unexpected, because, the, area, was, devastated, by, the, babylonians, then, rebuilt, and, destroyed, several, times, in, 2014, professor, of, anthropology, jimmy, hardin, and, his, team, discovered, six, official, clay, bullae, seals, at, a, site, east, of, gaza, called, khirbet, summeily, he, states, that, these, bullae, are, associated, with, an, iron, age, iia, political, entity, typified, by, elite, activities, dated, to, the, 10th, century, bce, the, bullae, appear, to, be, the, only, known, examples, that, date, to, this, period, in, his, view, this, lends, general, support, to, the, historical, veracity, of, david, and, solomon, as, recorded, in, the, hebrew, biblical, texts, little, archaeological, excavation, has, been, done, around, the, area, known, as, the, temple, mount, in, what, is, thought, to, be, the, foundation, of, solomon, s, temple, because, attempts, to, do, so, are, met, with, protests, by, muslim, authorities, of, the, jerusalem, waqf, the, biblical, passages, that, understand, tarshish, as, a, source, of, king, solomon, s, great, wealth, in, metals, especially, silver, but, also, gold, tin, and, iron, ezekiel, 27, were, linked, to, archaeological, evidence, from, silver, hoards, found, in, phoenicia, in, 2013, the, metals, from, tarshish, were, reportedly, obtained, by, solomon, in, partnership, with, king, hiram, of, phoenician, tyre, isaiah, 23, and, the, fleets, of, tarshish, and, ships, that, sailed, in, their, service, the, silver, hoards, provide, the, first, recognized, material, evidence, that, agrees, with, the, ancient, texts, concerning, solomon, s, kingdom, and, his, wealth, see, wealth, above, possible, evidence, for, the, described, wealth, of, solomon, and, his, kingdom, was, discovered, in, ancient, silver, hoards, which, were, found, in, israel, and, phoenicia, and, recognized, for, their, importance, in, 2003, the, evidence, from, the, hoards, shows, that, the, levant, was, a, center, of, wealth, in, precious, metals, during, the, reigns, of, solomon, and, hiram, and, matches, the, texts, that, say, the, trade, extended, from, asia, to, the, atlantic, ocean, the, distribution, of, fortified, cities, between, phoenicia, and, galilee, in, iron, age, iia, 10th, 9th, century, bce, provides, context, on, solomon, s, sale, of, territory, to, hiram, which, he, derided, as, cabul, i, e, good, for, nothing, kyle, h, keimer, argues, that, they, reflected, solomon, s, apathy, to, the, tribe, of, asher, who, lived, in, phoenicia, or, his, strategic, thinking, where, these, cities, served, as, defense, barriers, against, foreign, invasions, when, it, came, to, national, defense, near, eastern, states, did, not, rely, on, walls, instead, they, guarded, resources, which, they, prioritized, over, the, people, in, addition, it, revealed, solomon, s, political, upper, hand, over, hiram, these, events, were, subsequently, preserved, in, sources, which, a, deuteronomistic, historian, relied, on, when, writing, 1, kings, 9, 11, 14, from, a, critical, point, of, view, solomon, s, building, of, a, temple, for, yahweh, should, not, be, considered, an, act, of, particular, devotion, to, yahweh, because, solomon, is, also, described, as, building, places, of, worship, for, a, number, of, other, deities, some, scholars, and, historians, argue, that, the, passages, such, as, his, dedication, prayer, 1, kings, 8, 14, 66, that, describe, solomon, s, apparent, initial, devotion, to, yahweh, were, written, much, later, after, jerusalem, had, become, the, religious, centre, of, the, kingdom, replacing, locations, such, as, shiloh, and, bethel, earlier, historians, maintain, that, there, is, evidence, that, these, passages, in, kings, are, derived, from, official, court, records, at, the, time, of, solomon, and, from, other, writings, of, that, time, that, were, incorporated, into, the, canonical, books, of, kings, more, recent, scholars, believe, that, passages, such, as, these, in, the, books, of, kings, were, not, written, by, the, same, authors, who, wrote, the, rest, of, the, text, instead, probably, by, the, deuteronomist, king, solomon, sinned, by, acquiring, many, foreign, wives, and, horses, because, he, thought, he, knew, the, reason, for, the, biblical, prohibition, and, thought, it, did, not, apply, to, him, when, king, solomon, married, pharaoh, s, daughter, a, sandbank, formed, which, eventually, formed, the, great, nation, of, rome, the, nation, that, destroyed, herod, s, temple, solomon, gradually, lost, more, and, more, prestige, until, he, became, like, a, commoner, some, say, he, regained, his, status, while, others, say, he, did, not, in, the, end, however, he, is, regarded, as, a, righteous, king, and, is, especially, praised, for, his, diligence, in, building, the, temple, king, josiah, was, also, said, to, have, had, the, ark, of, the, covenant, aaron, s, rod, vial, of, manna, and, the, anointing, oil, placed, within, a, hidden, chamber, which, had, been, built, by, solomon, the, seder, olam, rabbah, holds, that, solomon, s, reign, was, not, in, 1000, bce, but, rather, in, the, ninth, century, bce, during, which, time, he, built, the, first, temple, in, 832, bce, however, the, jewish, encyclopedia, of, 1906, gives, the, more, common, date, of, 971, to, 931, bce, christianity, has, traditionally, accepted, the, historical, existence, of, solomon, though, some, modern, christian, scholars, have, also, questioned, at, least, his, authorship, of, those, biblical, texts, ascribed, to, him, such, disputes, tend, to, divide, christians, into, traditionalist, and, modernist, camps, of, the, two, genealogies, of, jesus, given, in, the, gospels, matthew, mentions, solomon, but, luke, does, not, some, commentators, see, this, as, an, issue, that, can, be, reconciled, while, others, disagree, for, instance, it, has, been, suggested, that, matthew, is, using, joseph, s, genealogy, and, luke, is, using, mary, s, but, darrell, bock, states, that, this, would, be, unprecedented, especially, when, no, other, single, woman, appears, in, the, line, other, suggestions, include, the, use, by, one, of, the, royal, and, the, other, of, the, natural, line, one, using, the, legal, line, and, the, other, the, physical, line, or, that, joseph, was, adopted, jesus, refers, to, solomon, using, him, for, comparison, in, his, admonition, against, worrying, about, life, this, account, is, recorded, in, matthew, 6, 29, and, the, parallel, passage, in, luke, 12, 27, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, solomon, is, commemorated, as, a, saint, with, the, title, of, righteous, prophet, and, king, his, feast, day, is, celebrated, on, the, sunday, of, the, holy, forefathers, two, sundays, before, the, great, feast, of, the, nativity, of, the, lord, the, staunchly, catholic, king, philip, ii, of, spain, sought, to, model, himself, after, king, solomon, statues, of, king, david, and, solomon, stand, on, either, side, of, the, entrance, to, the, basilica, of, el, escorial, philip, s, palace, and, solomon, is, also, depicted, in, a, great, fresco, at, the, center, of, el, escorial, s, library, philip, identified, the, warrior, king, david, with, his, own, father, charles, v, and, himself, sought, to, emulate, the, thoughtful, and, logical, character, which, he, perceived, in, solomon, moreover, the, structure, of, the, escorial, was, inspired, by, that, of, solomon, s, temple, in, islam, solomon, is, also, known, as, sulaim, n, ibn, d, w, d, and, is, considered, a, prophet, and, a, messenger, of, god, as, well, as, a, divinely, appointed, monarch, solomon, inherited, his, position, from, his, father, as, the, prophetic, king, of, the, israelites, unlike, in, the, bible, according, to, muslim, tradition, solomon, never, participated, in, idolatry, the, quran, ascribes, to, solomon, a, great, level, of, wisdom, knowledge, and, power, he, knew, the, language, of, the, birds, arabic, romanized, man, iq, al, ayr, solomon, was, also, known, in, islam, to, have, other, supernatural, abilities, bestowed, upon, him, by, god, like, controlling, the, wind, ruling, over, the, jinn, enslaving, divs, and, hearing, the, communication, of, ants, and, to, solomon, we, subjected, the, wind, its, morning, stride, was, a, month, s, journey, and, so, was, its, evening, stride, and, we, caused, a, stream, of, molten, copper, to, flow, for, him, and, we, subjected, some, of, the, jinn, to, work, under, him, by, his, lord, s, will, and, whoever, of, them, deviated, from, our, command, we, made, them, taste, the, torment, of, the, blaze, and, when, they, came, across, a, valley, of, ants, an, ant, warned, o, ants, go, quickly, into, your, homes, so, solomon, and, his, armies, do, not, crush, you, unknowingly, the, quran, says, they, instead, followed, the, magic, promoted, by, the, devils, during, the, reign, of, solomon, never, did, solomon, disbelieve, rather, the, devils, disbelieved, they, taught, magic, to, the, people, along, with, what, had, been, revealed, to, the, two, angels, h, r, t, and, m, r, t, in, babylon, the, two, angels, never, taught, anyone, without, saying, we, are, only, a, test, for, you, so, do, not, abandon, your, faith, yet, people, learned, magic, that, caused, a, rift, even, between, husband, and, wife, although, their, magic, could, not, harm, anyone, except, by, allah, s, will, they, learned, what, harmed, them, and, did, not, benefit, them, although, they, already, knew, that, whoever, buys, into, magic, would, have, no, share, in, the, hereafter, miserable, indeed, was, the, price, for, which, they, sold, their, souls, if, only, they, knew, the, quran, makes, a, reference, to, a, puppet, posing, as, solomon, in, exegetical, literature, understood, as, a, jinni, or, demon, who, escaped, captivity, and, took, over, his, kingdom, solomon, s, loss, of, his, throne, to, the, demons, has, been, understood, in, islamic, spirituality, to, represent, a, human, losing, its, soul, to, demonic, passion, attar, of, nishapur, writes, if, you, bind, the, div, demon, you, will, set, out, for, the, royal, pavilion, with, solomon, and, you, have, no, command, over, your, self, s, kingdom, for, in, your, case, the, div, is, in, the, place, of, solomon, solomon, s, gifts, are, often, used, allegorically, in, popular, literature, the, demons, taking, over, solomon, s, kingdom, mirrors, the, sufi, concept, of, the, mind, giving, in, to, evil, urges, the, ant, is, depicted, as, a, wise,

from, persian, mythology, about, who, similar, attributes, are, ascribed, to, in, the, bah, faith, solomon, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, lesser, prophets, along, with, david, isaiah, jeremiah, ezekiel, along, with, others, bah, s, see, solomon, as, a, prophet, who, was, sent, by, god, to, address, the, issues, of, his, time, baha, ullah, wrote, about, solomon, in, the, hidden, words, he, also, mentions, solomon, in, the, tablet, of, wisdom, where, he, is, depicted, as, a, contemporary, of, pythagoras, a, well, known, story, in, the, collection, one, thousand, and, one, nights, describes, a, genie, who, had, displeased, king, solomon, and, was, punished, by, being, locked, in, a, bottle, and, thrown, into, the, sea, since, the, bottle, was, sealed, with, solomon, s, seal, the, genie, was, helpless, to, free, himself, until, he, was, freed, many, centuries, later, by, a, fisherman, who, discovered, the, bottle, in, other, stories, from, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, protagonists, who, had, to, leave, their, homeland, and, travel, to, the, unknown, places, of, the, world, saw, signs, which, proved, that, solomon, had, already, been, there, sometimes, protagonists, discovered, words, of, solomon, that, were, intended, to, help, those, who, were, lost, and, had, unluckily, reached, those, forbidden, and, deserted, places, according, to, rabbinic, literature, on, account, of, his, modest, request, for, wisdom, only, solomon, was, rewarded, with, riches, and, an, unprecedented, glorious, realm, which, extended, over, the, upper, world, inhabited, by, the, angels, and, over, the, whole, of, the, terrestrial, globe, with, all, its, inhabitants, including, all, the, beasts, fowl, and, reptiles, as, well, as, the, demons, and, spirits,

plants, the, beasts, and, fowl, of, their, own, accord, entered, the, kitchen, of, solomon, s, palace, so, that, they, might, be, used, as, food, for, him, and, extravagant, meals, for, him, were, prepared, daily, by, each, of, his, 700, wives, and, 300, concubines, with, the, thought, that, perhaps, the, king, would, feast, that, day, in, her, house, the, seal, of, solomon, is, the, legendary, signet, ring, attributed, to, solomon, in, medieval, mystical, traditions, from, which, it, developed, in, parallel, within, jewish, mysticism, islamic, mysticism, and, western, occultism, it, is, the, predecessor, to, the, star, of, david, the, contemporary, cultural, and, religious, symbol, of, the, jewish, people, it, was, often, depicted, in, the, shape, of, either, a, pentagram, or, a, hexagram, in, religious, lore, the, ring, is, described, as, having, given, solomon, the, power, to, command, the, supernatural, and, also, the, ability, to, speak, with, animals, due, to, the, proverbial, wisdom, of, solomon, it, came, to, be, seen, as, an, amulet, or, talisman, or, a, symbol, or, character, in, medieval, magic, and, renaissance, magic, occultism, and, alchemy, one, legend, concerning, asmodeus, see, the, story, of, king, solomon, and, ashmedai, goes, on, to, state, that, solomon, one, day, asked, asmodeus, what, could, make, demons, powerful, over, man, and, asmodeus, asked, to, be, freed, and, given, the, ring, so, that, he, could, demonstrate, solomon, agreed, but, asmodeus, threw, the, ring, into, the, sea, and, it, was, swallowed, by, a, fish, asmodeus, then, swallowed, the, king, stood, up, fully, with, one, wing, touching, heaven, and, the, other, earth, and, spat, out, solomon, to, a, distance, of, 400, miles, the, rabbis, claim, this, was, a, divine, punishment, for, solomon, s, having, failed, to, follow, three, divine, commands, and, solomon, was, forced, to, wander, from, city, to, city, until, he, eventually, arrived, in, an, ammonite, city, where, he, was, forced, to, work, in, the, king, s, kitchens, solomon, gained, a, chance, to, prepare, a, meal, for, the, ammonite, king, which, the, king, found, so, impressive, that, the, previous, cook, was, sacked, and, solomon, put, in, his, place, the, king, s, daughter, naamah, subsequently, fell, in, love, with, solomon, but, the, family, thinking, solomon, a, commoner, disapproved, so, the, king, decided, to, kill, them, both, by, sending, them, into, the, desert, solomon, and, the, king, s, daughter, wandered, the, desert, until, they, reached, a, coastal, city, where, they, bought, a, fish, to, eat, which, just, happened, to, be, the, one, which, had, swallowed, the, magic, ring, solomon, was, then, able, to, regain, his, throne, and, expel, asmodeus, the, element, of, a, ring, thrown, into, the, sea, and, found, back, in, a, fish, s, belly, also, appeared, in, herodotus, account, of, polycrates, the, tyrant, of, samos, c, 538, 522, bce, in, another, familiar, version, of, the, legend, of, the, seal, of, solomon, asmodeus, disguises, himself, in, some, myths, he, s, disguised, as, king, solomon, himself, the, concealed, asmodeus, tells, travelers, who, have, ventured, up, to, king, solomon, s, grand, lofty, palace, that, the, seal, of, solomon, was, thrown, into, the, sea, he, then, convinces, them, to, plunge, in, and, attempt, to, retrieve, it, for, if, they, do, they, would, take, the, throne, as, king, other, magical, items, attributed, to, solomon, are, his, key, and, his, table, the, latter, was, said, to, be, held, in, toledo, in, visigothic, spain, and, was, part, of, the, loot, taken, by, tariq, ibn, ziyad, during, the, muslim, conquest, of, spain, according, to, ibn, abd, al, hakam, s, history, of, the, conquest, of, spain, the, former, appears, in, the, title, of, the, lesser, key, of, solomon, a, christian, grimoire, whose, framing, story, is, solomon, capturing, demons, using, his, ring, and, forcing, them, to, explain, themselves, to, him, in, the, book, of, deadly, names, purportedly, translated, from, arabic, manuscripts, found, hidden, in, a, building, in, spain, the, king, of, the, jinn, fiqi, ush, brings, 72, jinn, before, king, solomon, to, confess, their, corruptions, and, places, of, residence, fiqitush, tells, king, solomon, the, recipes, for, curing, such, corruptions, as, each, evil, jinn, confesses, angels, also, helped, solomon, in, building, the, temple, though, not, by, choice, the, edifice, was, according, to, rabbinical, legend, miraculously, constructed, throughout, the, large, heavy, stones, rising, and, settling, in, their, respective, places, of, themselves, the, general, opinion, of, the, rabbis, is, that, solomon, hewed, the, stones, by, means, of, a, shamir, a, mythical, worm, whose, mere, touch, cleft, rocks, according, to, midrash, tehillim, the, shamir, was, brought, from, paradise, by, solomon, s, eagle, but, most, of, the, rabbis, state, that, solomon, was, informed, of, the, worm, s, haunts, by, asmodeus, the, shamir, had, been, entrusted, by, the, prince, of, the, sea, to, the, mountain, rooster, alone, and, the, rooster, had, sworn, to, guard, it, well, but, solomon, s, men, found, the, bird, s, nest, and, covered, it, with, glass, when, the, bird, returned, it, used, the, shamir, to, break, the, glass, whereupon, the, men, scared, the, bird, causing, it, to, drop, the, worm, which, the, men, could, then, bring, to, solomon, early, adherents, of, the, kabbalah, portray, solomon, as, having, sailed, through, the, air, on, a, throne, of, light, placed, on, an, eagle, which, brought, him, near, the, heavenly, gates, as, well, as, to, the, dark, mountains, behind, which, the, fallen, angels, uzza, and, azzazel, were, chained, the, eagle, would, rest, on, the, chains, and, solomon, using, the, magic, ring, would, compel, the, two, angels, to, reveal, every, mystery, he, desired, to, know, according, to, one, legend, while, traveling, magically, solomon, noticed, a, magnificent, palace, to, which, there, appeared, to, be, no, entrance, he, ordered, the, demons, to, climb, to, the, roof, and, see, if, they, could, discover, any, living, being, within, the, building, but, they, found, only, an, eagle, which, said, that, it, was, 700, years, old, but, that, it, had, never, seen, an, entrance, an, elder, brother, of, the, eagle, 900, years, old, was, then, found, but, it, also, did, not, know, the, entrance, the, eldest, brother, of, these, two, birds, which, was, 1, 300, years, old, then, declared, it, had, been, informed, by, its, father, that, the, door, was, on, the, west, side, but, that, it, had, become, hidden, by, sand, drifted, by, the, wind, having, discovered, the, entrance, solomon, found, an, idol, inside, that, had, in, its, mouth, a, silver, tablet, saying, in, greek, a, language, not, thought, by, modern, scholars, to, have, existed, 1000, years, before, the, time, of, solomon, that, the, statue, was, of, shaddad, the, son, of, ad, and, that, it, had, reigned, over, a, million, cities, rode, on, a, million, horses, had, under, it, a, million, vassals, and, slew, a, million, warriors, yet, it, could, not, resist, the, angel, of, death, solomon, s, throne, is, described, at, length, in, targum, sheni, which, is, compiled, from, three, different, sources, and, in, two, later, midrash, according, to, these, there, were, on, the, steps, of, the, throne, twelve, golden, lions, each, facing, a, golden, eagle, there, were, six, steps, to, the, throne, on, which, animals, all, of, gold, were, arranged, in, the, following, order, on, the, first, step, a, lion, opposite, an, ox, on, the, second, a, wolf, opposite, a, sheep, on, the, third, a, tiger, opposite, a, camel, on, the, fourth, an, eagle, opposite, a, peacock, on, the, fifth, a, cat, opposite, a, cock, on, the, sixth, a, sparrow, hawk, opposite, a, dove, on, the, top, of, the, throne, was, a, dove, holding, a, sparrow, hawk, in, its, claws, symbolizing, the, dominion, of, israel, over, the, gentiles, the, first, midrash, claims, that, six, steps, were, constructed, because, solomon, foresaw, that, six, kings, would, sit, on, the, throne, namely, solomon, rehoboam, hezekiah, manasseh, amon, and, josiah, there, was, also, on, the, top, of, the, throne, a, golden, candelabrum, on, the, seven, branches,
