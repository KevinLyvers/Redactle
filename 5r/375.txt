oracles, were, often, consulted, before, setting, laws, in, a, city, apollo, agyieus, was, the, protector, of, the, streets, public, places, and, home, entrances, in, hellenistic, times, especially, during, the, 5th, century, bce, as, apollo, helios, he, became, identified, among, greeks, with, helios, the, personification, of, the, sun, in, latin, texts, however, there, was, no, conflation, of, apollo, with, sol, among, the, classical, latin, poets, until, 1st, century, ce, apollo, and, helios, sol, remained, separate, beings, in, literary, and, mythological, texts, until, the, 5th, century, ce, apollo, attic, ionic, and, homeric, greek, apoll, n, gen, doric, apell, n, arcadocypriot, apeil, n, aeolic, aploun, latin, apoll, the, name, apollo, unlike, the, related, older, name, paean, is, generally, not, found, in, the, linear, b, mycenean, greek, texts, although, there, is, a, possible, attestation, in, the, lacunose, form, pe, rjo, though, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, name, might, actually, read, hyperion, pe, rjo, the, etymology, of, the, name, is, uncertain, the, spelling, pronounced, in, classical, attic, had, almost, superseded, all, other, forms, by, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, but, the, doric, form, apellon, is, more, archaic, as, it, is, derived, from, an, earlier, j, it, probably, is, a, cognate, to, the, doric, month, apellaios, and, the, offerings, apellaia, at, the, initiation, of, the, young, men, during, the, family, festival, apellai, according, to, some, scholars, the, words, are, derived, from, the, doric, word, apella, which, originally, meant, wall, fence, for, animals, and, later, assembly, within, the, limits, of, the, square, apella, is, the, name, of, the, popular, assembly, in, sparta, corresponding, to, the, ecclesia, r, s, p, beekes, rejected, the, connection, of, the, theonym, with, the, noun, apellai, and, suggested, a, pre, greek, proto, form, apal, y, un, several, instances, of, popular, etymology, are, attested, by, ancient, authors, thus, the, greeks, most, often, associated, apollo, s, name, with, the, greek, verb, apollymi, to, destroy, plato, in, cratylus, connects, the, name, with, apolysis, redemption, with, apolousis, purification, and, with, aploun, simple, in, particular, in, reference, to, the, thessalian, form, of, the, name, and, finally, with, aeiballon, ever, shooting, hesychius, connects, the, name, apollo, with, the, doric, apella, which, means, assembly, so, that, apollo, would, be, the, god, of, political, life, and, he, also, gives, the, explanation, sekos, fold, in, which, case, apollo, would, be, the, god, of, flocks, and, herds, in, the, ancient, macedonian, language, pella, means, stone, and, some, toponyms, may, be, derived, from, this, word, pella, the, capital, of, ancient, macedonia, and, pell, n, pellene, the, hittite, form, apaliunas, d, x, ap, pa, li, u, na, a, is, attested, in, the, manapa, tarhunta, letter, the, hittite, testimony, reflects, an, early, form, apelj, n, which, may, also, be, surmised, from, the, comparison, of, cypriot, with, doric, the, name, of, the, lydian, god, q, d, ns, k, ns, may, reflect, an, earlier, k, aly, n, before, palatalization, syncope, and, the, pre, lydian, sound, change, y, d, note, the, labiovelar, in, place, of, the, labial, p, found, in, pre, doric, j, and, hittite, apaliunas, a, luwian, etymology, suggested, for, apaliunas, makes, apollo, the, one, of, entrapment, perhaps, in, the, sense, of, hunter, apollo, s, chief, epithet, was, phoebus, f, i, b, s, fee, b, s, phoibos, greek, pronunciation, literally, bright, it, was, very, commonly, used, by, both, the, greeks, and, romans, for, apollo, s, role, as, the, god, of, light, like, other, greek, deities, he, had, a, number, of, others, applied, to, him, reflecting, the, variety, of, roles, duties, and, aspects, ascribed, to, the, god, however, while, apollo, has, a, great, number, of, appellations, in, greek, myth, only, a, few, occur, in, latin, literature, apollo, s, birthplace, was, mount, cynthus, on, the, island, of, delos, delphi, and, actium, were, his, primary, places, of, worship, apollo, was, worshipped, throughout, the, roman, empire, in, the, traditionally, celtic, lands, he, was, most, often, seen, as, a, healing, and, sun, god, he, was, often, equated, with, celtic, gods, of, similar, character, apollo, is, considered, the, most, hellenic, greek, of, the, olympian, gods, the, cult, centers, of, apollo, in, greece, delphi, and, delos, date, from, the, 8th, century, bce, the, delos, sanctuary, was, primarily, dedicated, to, artemis, apollo, s, twin, sister, at, delphi, apollo, was, venerated, as, the, slayer, of, the, monstrous, serpent, python, for, the, greeks, apollo, was, the, most, greek, of, all, the, gods, and, through, the, centuries, he, acquired, different, functions, in, archaic, greece, he, was, the, prophet, the, oracular, god, who, in, older, times, was, connected, with, healing, in, classical, greece, he, was, the, god, of, light, and, of, music, but, in, popular, religion, he, had, a, strong, function, to, keep, away, evil, walter, burkert, discerned, three, components, in, the, prehistory, of, apollo, worship, which, he, termed, a, dorian, northwest, greek, component, a, cretan, minoan, component, and, a, syro, hittite, component, in, classical, times, his, major, function, in, popular, religion, was, to, keep, away, evil, and, he, was, therefore, called, apotropaios, averting, evil, and, alexikakos, keeping, off, ill, from, v, n, apollo, also, had, many, epithets, relating, to, his, function, as, a, healer, some, commonly, used, examples, are, paion, literally, healer, or, helper, epikourios, succouring, oulios, healer, baleful, and, loimios, of, the, plague, in, later, writers, the, word, paion, usually, spelled, paean, becomes, a, mere, epithet, of, apollo, in, his, capacity, as, a, god, of, healing, apollo, in, his, aspect, of, healer, has, a, connection, to, the, primitive, god, paean, who, did, not, have, a, cult, of, his, own, paean, serves, as, the, healer, of, the, gods, in, the, iliad, and, seems, to, have, originated, in, a, pre, greek, religion, it, is, suggested, though, unconfirmed, that, he, is, connected, to, the, mycenaean, figure, pa, ja, wo, ne, linear, b, paean, was, the, personification, of, holy, songs, sung, by, seer, doctors, which, were, supposed, to, cure, disease, homer, illustrated, paeon, the, god, and, the, song, both, of, apotropaic, thanksgiving, or, triumph, such, songs, were, originally, addressed, to, apollo, and, afterwards, to, other, gods, to, dionysus, to, apollo, helios, to, apollo, s, son, asclepius, the, healer, about, the, 4th, century, bce, the, paean, became, merely, a, formula, of, adulation, its, object, was, either, to, implore, protection, against, disease, and, misfortune, or, to, offer, thanks, after, such, protection, had, been, rendered, it, was, in, this, way, that, apollo, had, become, recognized, as, the, god, of, music, apollo, s, role, as, the, slayer, of, the, python, led, to, his, association, with, battle, and, victory, hence, it, became, the, roman, custom, for, a, paean, to, be, sung, by, an, army, on, the, march, and, before, entering, into, battle, when, a, fleet, left, the, harbour, and, also, after, a, victory, had, been, won, in, the, iliad, apollo, is, the, healer, under, the, gods, but, he, is, also, the, bringer, of, disease, and, death, with, his, arrows, similar, to, the, function, of, the, vedic, god, of, disease, rudra, he, sends, a, plague, to, the, achaeans, knowing, that, apollo, can, prevent, a, recurrence, of, the, plague, he, sent, they, purify, themselves, in, a, ritual, and, offer, him, a, large, sacrifice, of, cows, called, a, hecatomb, the, homeric, hymn, to, apollo, depicts, apollo, as, an, intruder, from, the, north, the, connection, with, the, northern, dwelling, dorians, and, their, initiation, festival, apellai, is, reinforced, by, the, month, apellaios, in, northwest, greek, calendars, the, family, festival, was, dedicated, to, apollo, doric, apellaios, is, the, month, of, these, rites, and, apellon, is, the, megistos, kouros, the, great, kouros, however, it, can, explain, only, the, doric, type, of, the, name, which, is, connected, with, the, ancient, macedonian, word, pella, pella, stone, stones, played, an, important, part, in, the, cult, of, the, god, especially, in, the, oracular, shrine, of, delphi, omphalos, george, huxley, regarded, the, identification, of, apollo, with, the, minoan, deity, paiawon, worshipped, in, crete, to, have, originated, at, delphi, in, the, homeric, hymn, apollo, appeared, as, a, dolphin, and, carried, cretan, priests, to, delphi, where, they, evidently, transferred, their, religious, practices, apollo, delphinios, or, delphidios, was, a, sea, god, especially, worshipped, in, crete, and, in, the, islands, apollo, s, sister, artemis, who, was, the, greek, goddess, of, hunting, is, identified, with, britomartis, diktynna, the, minoan, mistress, of, the, animals, in, her, earliest, depictions, she, was, accompanied, by, the, master, of, the, animals, a, bow, wielding, god, of, hunting, whose, name, has, been, lost, aspects, of, this, figure, may, have, been, absorbed, into, the, more, popular, apollo, a, non, greek, origin, of, apollo, has, long, been, assumed, in, scholarship, the, name, of, apollo, s, mother, leto, has, lydian, origin, and, she, was, worshipped, on, the, coasts, of, asia, minor, the, inspiration, oracular, cult, was, probably, introduced, into, greece, from, anatolia, which, is, the, origin, of, sibyl, and, where, some, of, the, oldest, oracular, shrines, originated, omens, symbols, purifications, and, exorcisms, appear, in, old, assyro, babylonian, texts, these, rituals, were, spread, into, the, empire, of, the, hittites, and, from, there, into, greece, homer, pictures, apollo, on, the, side, of, the, trojans, fighting, against, the, achaeans, during, the, trojan, war, he, is, pictured, as, a, terrible, god, less, trusted, by, the, greeks, than, other, gods, the, god, seems, to, be, related, to, appaliunas, a, tutelary, god, of, wilusa, troy, in, asia, minor, but, the, word, is, not, complete, the, stones, found, in, front, of, the, gates, of, homeric, troy, were, the, symbols, of, apollo, a, western, anatolian, origin, may, also, be, bolstered, by, references, to, the, parallel, worship, of, artimus, artemis, and, q, d, ns, whose, name, may, be, cognate, with, the, hittite, and, doric, forms, in, surviving, lydian, texts, however, recent, scholars, have, cast, doubt, on, the, identification, of, q, d, ns, with, apollo, the, greeks, gave, to, him, the, name, agyieus, as, the, protector, god, of, public, places, and, houses, who, wards, off, evil, and, his, symbol, was, a, tapered, stone, or, column, however, while, usually, greek, festivals, were, celebrated, at, the, full, moon, all, the, feasts, of, apollo, were, celebrated, on, the, seventh, day, of, the, month, and, the, emphasis, given, to, that, day, sibutu, indicates, a, babylonian, origin, the, vedic, rudra, has, some, similar, functions, to, apollo, the, terrible, god, is, called, the, archer, and, the, bow, is, also, an, attribute, of, shiva, rudra, could, bring, diseases, with, his, arrows, but, he, was, able, to, free, people, of, them, and, his, alternative, shiva, is, a, healer, physician, god, however, the, indo, european, component, of, apollo, does, not, explain, his, strong, relation, with, omens, exorcisms, and, with, the, oracular, cult, unusually, among, the, olympic, deities, apollo, had, two, cult, sites, that, had, widespread, influence, delos, and, delphi, in, cult, practice, delian, apollo, and, pythian, apollo, the, apollo, of, delphi, were, so, distinct, that, they, might, both, have, shrines, in, the, same, locality, lycia, was, sacred, to, the, god, for, this, apollo, was, also, called, lycian, apollo, s, cult, was, already, fully, established, when, written, sources, commenced, about, 650, bce, apollo, became, extremely, important, to, the, greek, world, as, an, oracular, deity, in, the, archaic, period, and, the, frequency, of, theophoric, names, such, as, apollodorus, or, apollonios, and, cities, named, apollonia, testify, to, his, popularity, oracular, sanctuaries, to, apollo, were, established, in, other, sites, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, century, ce, those, at, didyma, and, claros, pronounced, the, so, called, theological, oracles, in, which, apollo, confirms, that, all, deities, are, aspects, or, servants, of, an, all, encompassing, highest, deity, in, the, 3rd, century, apollo, fell, silent, julian, the, apostate, 359, 361, tried, to, revive, the, delphic, oracle, but, failed, apollo, had, a, famous, oracle, in, delphi, and, other, notable, ones, in, claros, and, didyma, his, oracular, shrine, in, abae, in, phocis, where, he, bore, the, toponymic, epithet, abaeus, apollon, abaios, was, important, enough, to, be, consulted, by, croesus, his, oracular, shrines, include, oracles, were, also, given, by, sons, of, apollo, many, temples, were, dedicated, to, apollo, in, greece, and, the, greek, colonies, they, show, the, spread, of, the, cult, of, apollo, and, the, evolution, of, greek, architecture, which, was, mostly, based, on, the, rightness, of, form, and, on, mathematical, relations, some, of, the, earliest, temples, especially, in, crete, do, not, belong, to, any, greek, order, it, seems, that, the, first, peripteral, temples, were, rectangular, wooden, structures, the, different, wooden, elements, were, considered, divine, and, their, forms, were, preserved, in, the, marble, or, stone, elements, of, the, temples, of, doric, order, the, greeks, used, standard, types, because, they, believed, that, the, world, of, objects, was, a, series, of, typical, forms, which, could, be, represented, in, several, instances, the, temples, should, be, canonic, and, the, architects, were, trying, to, achieve, this, esthetic, perfection, from, the, earliest, times, there, were, certain, rules, strictly, observed, in, rectangular, peripteral, and, prostyle, buildings, the, first, buildings, were, built, narrowly, in, order, to, hold, the, roof, and, when, the, dimensions, changed, some, mathematical, relations, became, necessary, in, order, to, keep, the, original, forms, this, probably, influenced, the, theory, of, numbers, of, pythagoras, who, believed, that, behind, the, appearance, of, things, there, was, the, permanent, principle, of, mathematics, the, doric, order, dominated, during, the, 6th, and, the, 5th, century, bc, but, there, was, a, mathematical, problem, regarding, the, position, of, the, triglyphs, which, could, not, be, solved, without, changing, the, original, forms, the, order, was, almost, abandoned, for, the, ionic, order, but, the, ionic, capital, also, posed, an, insoluble, problem, at, the, corner, of, a, temple, both, orders, were, abandoned, for, the, corinthian, order, gradually, during, the, hellenistic, age, and, under, rome, the, most, important, temples, are, in, the, myths, apollo, is, the, son, of, zeus, the, king, of, the, gods, and, leto, his, previous, wife, or, one, of, his, mistresses, apollo, often, appears, in, the, myths, plays, and, hymns, either, directly, or, indirectly, through, his, oracles, as, zeus, favorite, son, he, had, direct, access, to, the, mind, of, zeus, and, was, willing, to, reveal, this, knowledge, to, humans, a, divinity, beyond, human, comprehension, he, appears, both, as, a, beneficial, and, a, wrathful, god, pregnant, with, the, offsprings, of, zeus, leto, wandered, through, many, lands, wanting, to, give, birth, to, apollo, however, all, the, lands, rejected, her, out, of, fear, upon, reaching, delos, leto, requested, the, island, to, shelter, her, and, that, in, return, her, son, would, bring, fame, and, prosperity, to, the, island, delos, then, revealed, to, leto, that, apollo, was, rumoured, to, be, the, god, who, will, greatly, lord, it, among, gods, and, men, all, over, the, fruitful, earth, for, this, reason, all, the, lands, were, fearful, and, delos, feared, that, apollo, would, cast, her, aside, once, he, is, born, hearing, this, leto, swore, on, the, river, styx, that, if, she, is, allowed, to, give, birth, on, the, island, her, son, would, honour, delos, the, most, amongst, all, the, other, lands, assured, by, this, delos, agreed, to, assist, leto, all, goddesses, except, hera, also, came, to, aid, leto, however, hera, had, tricked, eileithyia, the, goddess, of, childbirth, to, stay, on, olympus, due, to, which, leto, was, unable, to, give, birth, the, goddesses, then, convinced, iris, to, go, bring, eileithyia, by, offering, her, a, necklace, of, amber, 9, yards, 8, 2, m, long, iris, did, accordingly, and, persuaded, eileithyia, to, step, onto, the, island, thus, clutching, a, palm, tree, leto, finally, gave, birth, after, labouring, for, nine, days, and, nine, nights, with, apollo, leaping, forth, from, his, mother, s, womb, the, goddesses, washed, the, newborn, covered, him, in, a, white, garment, and, fastened, golden, bands, around, him, as, leto, was, unable, to, feed, him, themis, the, goddess, of, divine, law, fed, him, nectar, and, ambrosia, upon, tasting, the, divine, food, the, child, broke, free, of, the, bands, fastened, onto, him, and, declared, that, he, would, be, the, master, of, lyre, and, archery, and, interpret, the, will, of, zeus, to, humankind, he, then, started, to, walk, which, caused, the, island, to, be, filled, with, gold, the, island, delos, used, to, be, asteria, a, goddess, who, jumped, into, the, waters, to, escape, the, advances, of, zeus, and, became, a, free, floating, island, of, the, same, name, when, leto, got, pregnant, hera, was, told, that, leto, s, son, would, become, more, dear, to, zeus, than, ares, enraged, by, this, hera, watched, over, the, heavens, and, sent, out, ares, and, iris, to, prevent, leto, from, giving, birth, on, the, earth, ares, stationed, over, the, mainland, and, iris, over, the, islands, threatened, all, the, lands, and, prevented, them, from, helping, leto, when, leto, arrived, at, thebes, fetal, apollo, prophesied, from, his, mother, s, womb, that, in, the, future, he, would, punish, a, slanderous, woman, in, thebes, niobe, so, he, did, not, want, to, be, born, there, leto, then, went, to, thessaly, and, sought, the, help, of, the, river, nymphs, who, were, the, daughters, of, the, river, peneus, though, he, was, initially, fearful, and, reluctant, peneus, later, decided, to, let, leto, give, birth, in, his, waters, he, did, not, change, his, mind, even, when, ares, produced, a, terrifying, sound, and, threatened, to, hurl, mountain, peaks, into, the, river, but, leto, herself, declined, his, help, and, departed, as, she, did, not, want, him, to, suffer, for, her, sake, after, being, turned, away, from, various, lands, apollo, spoke, again, from, the, womb, asking, his, mother, to, take, look, at, the, floating, island, in, front, of, her, and, expressing, his, wish, to, be, born, there, when, leto, approached, asteria, all, the, other, islands, fled, but, asteria, welcomed, leto, without, any, fear, of, hera, walking, on, the, island, she, sat, down, against, a, palm, tree, and, asked, apollo, to, be, born, during, the, childbirth, swans, circled, the, island, seven, times, a, sign, that, later, on, apollo, would, play, the, seven, stringed, lyre, when, apollo, finally, leapt, forth, from, his, mother, s, womb, the, nymphs, of, the, island, sang, a, hymn, to, eileithyia, that, was, heard, to, the, heavens, the, moment, apollo, was, born, the, entire, island, including, the, trees, and, the, waters, became, gold, asteria, bathed, the, newborn, swaddled, him, and, fed, him, with, her, breast, milk, the, island, had, become, rooted, and, was, later, called, delos, hera, was, no, longer, angry, as, zeus, had, managed, to, calm, her, down, and, she, held, no, grudge, against, asteria, since, asteria, had, rejected, zeus, in, the, past, pindar, is, the, earliest, source, who, explicitly, calls, apollo, and, artemis, as, twins, here, asteria, is, also, stated, to, be, leto, s, sister, wanting, to, escape, zeus, advances, she, flung, herself, into, the, sea, and, became, a, floating, rock, called, ortygia, until, the, twins, were, born, when, leto, stepped, on, the, rock, four, pillars, with, adamantine, bases, rose, from, the, earth, and, held, up, the, rock, when, apollo, and, artemis, were, born, their, bodies, shone, radiantly, and, a, chant, was, sung, by, eileithyia, and, lachesis, one, of, the, three, moirai, scorning, the, advances, of, zeus, asteria, transformed, herself, into, a, bird, and, jumped, into, a, sea, from, her, an, island, rose, which, was, called, ortygia, when, hera, discovered, that, leto, was, pregnant, with, zeus, child, she, decreed, that, leto, can, give, birth, only, in, a, place, where, sun, does, not, shine, during, this, time, the, monster, python, also, started, hounding, leto, with, an, intent, of, killing, her, because, he, had, foreseen, his, death, coming, at, the, hands, of, leto, s, offspring, however, on, zeus, orders, boreas, carried, away, leto, and, entrusted, her, to, poseidon, to, protect, her, poseidon, took, her, to, the, island, ortygia, and, covered, it, with, waves, so, that, the, sun, would, not, shine, on, it, leto, gave, birth, clinging, to, an, olive, tree, and, henceforth, the, island, was, called, delos, other, variations, of, apollo, s, birth, include, aelian, states, that, it, took, leto, twelve, days, and, twelve, nights, to, travel, from, hyperborea, to, delos, leto, changed, herself, into, a, she, wolf, before, giving, birth, this, is, given, as, the, reason, why, homer, describes, apollo, as, the, wolf, born, god, libanius, wrote, that, neither, land, nor, visible, islands, would, receive, leto, but, by, the, will, of, zeus, delos, then, became, visible, and, thus, received, leto, and, the, children, according, to, strabo, the, curetes, helped, leto, by, creating, loud, noises, with, their, weapons, and, thus, frightening, hera, they, concealed, leto, s, childbirth, theognis, wrote, that, the, island, was, filled, with, ambrosial, fragrance, when, apollo, was, born, and, the, earth, laughed, with, joy, while, in, some, accounts, apollo, s, birth, itself, fixed, the, floating, delos, to, the, earth, there, are, accounts, of, apollo, securing, delos, to, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, a, little, while, later, this, island, became, sacred, to, apollo, and, was, one, of, the, major, cult, centres, of, the, god, apollo, was, born, on, the, seventh, day, hebdomagenes, of, the, month, thargelion, according, to, delian, tradition, or, of, the, month, bysios, according, to, delphian, tradition, the, seventh, and, twentieth, the, days, of, the, new, and, full, moon, were, ever, afterwards, held, sacred, to, him, the, general, consensus, is, that, artemis, was, born, first, and, subsequently, assisted, with, the, birth, of, apollo, hyperborea, the, mystical, land, of, eternal, spring, venerated, apollo, above, all, the, gods, the, hyperboreans, always, sang, and, danced, in, his, honor, and, hosted, pythian, games, there, a, vast, forest, of, beautiful, trees, was, called, the, garden, of, apollo, apollo, spent, the, winter, months, among, the, hyperboreans, leaving, his, shrine, in, delphi, under, the, care, of, dionysus, his, absence, from, the, world, caused, coldness, and, this, was, marked, as, his, annual, death, no, prophecies, were, issued, during, this, time, he, returned, to, the, world, during, the, beginning, of, the, spring, the, theophania, festival, was, held, in, delphi, to, celebrate, his, return, however, diodorus, silculus, states, that, apollo, visited, hyperborea, every, nineteen, years, this, nineteen, year, period, was, called, by, the, greeks, as, the, year, of, meton, the, time, period, in, which, the, stars, returned, to, their, initial, positions, and, that, visiting, hyperborea, at, that, time, apollo, played, on, the, cithara, and, danced, continuously, from, the, vernal, equinox, until, the, rising, of, the, pleiades, constellations, hyperborea, was, also, leto, s, birthplace, it, is, said, that, leto, came, to, delos, from, hyperborea, accompanied, by, a, pack, of, wolves, henceforth, hyperborea, became, apollo, s, winter, home, and, wolves, became, sacred, to, him, his, intimate, connection, to, wolves, is, evident, from, his, epithet, lyceus, meaning, wolf, like, but, apollo, was, also, the, wolf, slayer, in, his, role, as, the, god, who, protected, flocks, from, predators, the, hyperborean, worship, of, apollo, bears, the, strongest, marks, of, apollo, being, worshipped, as, the, sun, god, shamanistic, elements, in, apollo, s, cult, are, often, liked, to, his, hyperborean, origin, and, he, is, likewise, speculated, to, have, originated, as, a, solar, shaman, shamans, like, abaris, and, aristeas, were, also, the, followers, of, apollo, who, hailed, from, hyperborea, in, myths, the, tears, of, amber, apollo, shed, when, his, son, asclepius, died, mixed, with, the, waters, of, the, river, eridanos, which, surrounded, hyperborea, apollo, also, buried, in, hyperborea, the, arrow, which, he, had, used, to, kill, the, cyclopes, he, later, gave, this, arrow, to, abaris, growing, up, apollo, was, nursed, by, the, nymphs, korythalia, and, aletheia, the, personification, of, truth, phoebe, his, grandmother, gave, the, oracular, shrine, of, delphi, to, apollo, as, a, birthday, gift, as, a, four, year, old, child, apollo, built, a, foundation, and, an, altar, on, delos, using, the, horns, of, the, goats, that, his, sister, artemis, hunted, since, he, learnt, the, art, of, building, when, young, he, came, to, be, known, as, archegetes, the, founder, of, towns, and, guided, men, to, build, new, cities, to, keep, the, child, amused, the, delian, nymphs, ran, around, the, altar, beating, it, and, then, with, their, hands, tied, behind, their, backs, bit, an, olive, branch, it, later, became, a, custom, for, all, the, sailors, who, passed, by, the, island, to, do, the, same, from, his, father, zeus, apollo, received, a, golden, headband, and, a, chariot, driven, by, swans, in, his, early, years, when, apollo, spent, his, time, herding, cows, he, was, reared, by, the, thriae, who, trained, him, and, enhanced, his, prophetic, skills, the, god, pan, was, also, said, to, mentored, him, in, the, prophetic, art, apollo, is, also, said, to, have, invented, the, lyre, and, along, with, artemis, the, art, of, archery, he, then, taught, the, humans, the, art, of, healing, and, archery, soon, after, giving, birth, to, her, twins, leto, fled, from, delos, fearing, hera, upon, reaching, lycia, her, infants, had, drained, all, of, their, mother, s, milk, and, cried, for, more, to, satisfy, their, hunger, the, exhausted, mother, then, tried, drinking, from, a, nearby, lake, but, was, stopped, by, some, lycian, peasants, when, she, begged, them, to, let, her, quench, her, thirst, the, haughty, peasants, not, only, threatened, her, but, also, stirred, the, mud, in, the, lake, to, dirty, the, waters, angered, by, this, leto, turned, them, into, frogs, in, a, slightly, varied, version, leto, took, her, infants, and, crossed, over, to, lycia, where, she, attempted, to, bathe, her, children, in, a, spring, she, found, there, but, the, local, herdsmen, drove, her, away, after, that, some, wolves, found, leto, and, guided, her, to, the, river, xanthos, where, leto, was, able, to, bathe, her, children, and, quench, her, thirst, she, then, returned, to, the, spring, and, turned, the, herdsmen, into, frogs, python, a, chthonic, serpent, dragon, was, a, child, of, gaia, and, the, guardian, of, the, delphic, oracle, in, the, callimachus, hymn, to, delos, fetal, apollo, foresees, the, death, of, python, at, his, hands, in, the, homeric, hymn, to, apollo, python, was, a, female, drakon, and, the, nurse, of, the, giant, typhon, whom, hera, had, created, to, overthrow, zeus, she, was, described, as, a, terrifying, monster, and, a, bloody, plague, apollo, in, his, pursuit, to, establish, his, worship, came, across, python, and, killed, her, with, a, single, arrow, shot, from, his, bow, he, let, the, corpse, rot, under, the, sun, and, declared, himself, the, oracular, deity, of, delphi, other, authors, have, apollo, kill, the, monster, using, a, hundred, arrows, or, a, thousand, arrows, according, to, euripides, leto, had, brought, her, twins, to, the, cliffs, of, parnassus, shortly, after, giving, birth, to, them, upon, seeing, the, monster, there, apollo, still, a, child, being, carried, in, his, mother, s, arms, leapt, forth, and, killed, python, some, authors, also, mention, that, python, was, killed, for, displaying, lustful, affections, towards, leto, in, another, account, python, chased, pregnant, leto, with, an, intent, of, killing, her, because, his, death, was, fated, to, come, at, the, hands, of, leto, s, child, however, he, had, to, stop, the, chase, when, leto, came, under, the, protection, of, poseidon, after, his, birth, four, days, old, apollo, killed, the, serpent, with, the, bow, and, arrows, gifted, to, him, by, hephaestus, and, avenged, the, trouble, given, to, his, mother, the, god, then, put, the, bones, of, the, slain, monster, in, a, cauldron, and, deposited, it, in, his, temple, this, legend, is, also, narrated, as, the, origin, of, the, cry, hi, paian, according, to, athenaeus, pyhton, attacked, leto, and, her, twins, during, their, visit, to, delphi, taking, artemis, into, her, arms, leto, climbed, upon, a, rock, and, cried, at, apollo, to, shoot, the, monster, the, cry, let, out, by, her, shoot, boy, later, got, slightly, altered, as, hi, paian, an, exclamation, to, avert, evils, callimachus, attributes, the, origin, of, this, phrase, to, the, delphians, who, let, out, the, cry, to, encourage, apollo, when, the, young, god, battled, with, python, strabo, has, recorded, a, slightly, different, version, where, python, was, actually, a, cruel, and, lawless, man, who, was, also, known, by, the, name, drakon, when, apollo, was, teaching, the, humans, to, cultivate, fruits, and, civilise, themselves, the, residents, of, parnassus, complained, to, the, god, about, python, in, response, to, their, pleas, apollo, killed, the, man, with, his, arrows, during, the, fight, the, parnassians, shouted, hi, paian, to, encourage, the, god, continuing, from, his, victory, over, python, the, homeric, hymn, describes, how, the, young, god, established, his, worship, among, the, humans, as, apollo, was, pondering, about, what, kind, of, men, he, should, recruit, to, serve, him, he, spotted, a, ship, full, of, cretan, merchants, or, pirates, he, took, the, form, of, a, dolphin, and, sprang, aboard, the, ship, whenever, the, oblivious, crew, members, tried, throwing, the, dolphin, overboard, the, god, shook, the, ship, until, the, crew, was, awed, into, submission, apollo, then, created, a, breeze, that, directed, the, ship, to, delphi, upon, reaching, the, land, he, revealed, himself, as, a, god, and, initiated, them, as, his, priests, he, instructed, them, to, guard, his, temple, and, always, keep, righteousness, in, their, hearts, alcaeus, narrates, the, following, account, zeus, who, had, adorned, his, newborn, son, with, a, golden, headband, also, provided, him, with, a, chariot, driven, by, swans, and, instructed, apollo, to, visit, delphi, to, establish, his, laws, among, the, people, but, apollo, disobeyed, his, father, and, went, to, the, land, of, hyperborea, the, delphians, continuously, sung, paeans, in, his, honour, and, pleaded, him, to, come, back, to, them, the, god, returned, only, after, a, year, and, then, carried, out, zeus, orders, in, other, variations, the, shrine, at, delphi, was, simply, handed, over, to, apollo, by, his, grandmother, phoebe, as, a, gift, or, themis, herself, inspired, him, to, be, the, oracular, voice, of, delphi, however, in, many, other, accounts, apollo, had, to, overcome, certain, obstacles, before, he, was, able, to, establish, himself, at, delphi, gaea, came, in, conflict, with, apollo, for, killing, python, and, claiming, the, delphic, oracle, for, himself, according, to, pindar, she, sought, to, banish, apollo, to, tartarus, as, a, punishment, according, to, euripides, soon, after, apollo, took, the, ownership, of, the, oracle, gaea, started, sending, prophetic, dreams, to, the, humans, as, a, result, people, stopped, visiting, delphi, to, obtain, prophecies, troubled, by, this, apollo, went, to, olympus, and, supplicated, to, zeus, zeus, admiring, the, ambitions, of, his, young, son, granted, his, request, by, putting, an, end, to, the, dream, visions, this, sealed, the, role, of, apollo, as, the, oracular, deity, of, delphi, since, apollo, had, committed, a, blood, crime, he, also, had, to, be, purified, pausanias, has, recorded, two, of, the, many, variations, of, this, purification, in, one, of, them, both, apollo, and, artemis, fled, to, sicyon, and, were, purified, there, in, the, other, tradition, that, had, been, prevalent, among, the, cretans, apollo, alone, travelled, to, crete, and, was, purified, by, carmanor, in, another, account, the, argive, king, crotopus, was, the, one, who, performed, the, purification, rites, on, apollo, alone, according, the, aristonous, and, aelian, apollo, was, purified, by, the, will, of, zeus, in, the, vale, of, tempe, aristonous, has, continued, the, tale, saying, that, apollo, was, escorted, back, to, delphi, by, athena, as, a, token, of, gratitude, he, later, built, a, temple, for, athena, at, delphi, which, served, as, a, threshold, for, his, own, temple, upon, reaching, delphi, apollo, convinced, gaea, and, themis, into, handing, over, the, seat, of, oracle, to, him, to, celebrate, this, event, other, immortals, also, graced, apollo, with, gifts, poseidon, gave, him, the, land, of, delphi, the, delphian, nymphs, gifted, him, the, corycian, cave, and, artemis, set, her, dogs, to, patrol, and, safeguard, the, land, some, others, have, also, said, that, apollo, was, exiled, and, subjected, to, servitude, under, king, admetus, as, a, means, of, punishment, for, the, murder, he, had, committed, it, was, when, he, was, serving, as, a, cowherd, under, admetus, that, the, theft, of, the, cattle, by, hermes, happened, the, servitude, was, said, to, have, lasted, for, either, one, year, or, one, great, year, a, cycle, of, eight, years, or, nine, years, plutarch, however, has, mentioned, a, variation, where, apollo, was, neither, purified, in, tempe, nor, banished, to, earth, as, a, servant, for, nine, years, but, was, driven, out, to, another, world, for, nine, great, years, the, god, who, returned, was, cleansed, and, purified, thus, becoming, a, true, phoebus, that, is, to, say, clear, and, bright, he, then, took, over, the, delphic, oracle, which, had, been, under, the, care, of, themis, in, his, absence, henceforth, apollo, became, the, god, who, cleansed, himself, from, the, sin, of, murder, made, men, aware, of, their, guilt, and, purified, them, the, pythian, games, were, also, established, by, apollo, either, as, funeral, games, to, honor, python, or, to, celebrate, his, own, victory, the, pythia, was, apollo, s, high, priestess, and, his, mouthpiece, through, whom, he, gave, prophecies, tityus, was, another, giant, who, tried, to, rape, leto, either, on, his, own, accord, when, she, was, on, her, way, to, delphi, or, at, the, order, of, hera, leto, called, upon, on, her, children, who, instantly, slew, the, giant, apollo, still, a, young, boy, shot, him, with, his, arrows, in, some, accounts, artemis, also, joined, him, in, protecting, their, mother, by, attacking, tityos, with, her, arrows, for, this, act, he, was, banished, to, tartarus, and, there, he, was, pegged, to, the, rock, floor, and, stretched, on, an, area, of, 9, acres, 36, 000, m, 2, while, a, pair, of, vultures, feasted, daily, on, his, liver, or, his, heart, another, account, recorded, by, strabo, says, that, tityus, was, not, a, giant, but, a, lawless, man, whom, apollo, killed, at, the, request, of, the, residents, admetus, was, the, king, of, pherae, who, was, known, for, his, hospitality, when, apollo, was, exiled, from, olympus, for, killing, python, he, served, as, a, herdsman, under, admetus, who, was, then, young, and, unmarried, apollo, is, said, to, have, shared, a, romantic, relationship, with, admetus, during, his, stay, after, completing, his, years, of, servitude, apollo, went, back, to, olympus, as, a, god, because, admetus, had, treated, apollo, well, the, god, conferred, great, benefits, on, him, in, return, apollo, s, mere, presence, is, said, to, have, made, the, cattle, give, birth, to, twins, apollo, helped, admetus, win, the, hand, of, alcestis, the, daughter, of, king, pelias, by, taming, a, lion, and, a, boar, to, draw, admetus, chariot, he, was, present, during, their, wedding, to, give, his, blessings, when, admetus, angered, the, goddess, artemis, by, forgetting, to, give, her, the, due, offerings, apollo, came, to, the, rescue, and, calmed, his, sister, when, apollo, learnt, of, admetus, untimely, death, he, convinced, or, tricked, the, fates, into, letting, admetus, live, past, his, time, according, to, another, version, or, perhaps, some, years, later, when, zeus, struck, down, apollo, s, son, asclepius, with, a, lightning, bolt, for, resurrecting, the, dead, apollo, in, revenge, killed, the, cyclopes, who, had, fashioned, the, bolt, for, zeus, apollo, would, have, been, banished, to, tartarus, for, this, but, his, mother, leto, intervened, and, reminding, zeus, of, their, old, love, pleaded, with, him, not, to, kill, their, son, zeus, obliged, and, sentenced, apollo, to, one, year, of, hard, labor, once, again, under, admetus, the, love, between, apollo, and, admetus, was, a, favored, topic, of, roman, poets, like, ovid, and, servius, the, fate, of, niobe, was, prophesied, by, apollo, while, he, was, still, in, leto, s, womb, niobe, was, the, queen, of, thebes, and, wife, of, amphion, she, displayed, hubris, when, she, boasted, that, she, was, superior, to, leto, because, she, had, fourteen, children, niobids, seven, male, and, seven, female, while, leto, had, only, two, she, further, mocked, apollo, s, effeminate, appearance, and, artemis, manly, appearance, leto, insulted, by, this, told, her, children, to, punish, niobe, accordingly, apollo, killed, niobe, s, sons, and, artemis, her, daughters, according, to, some, versions, of, the, myth, among, the, niobids, chloris, and, her, brother, amyclas, were, not, killed, because, they, prayed, to, leto, amphion, at, the, sight, of, his, dead, sons, either, killed, himself, or, was, killed, by, apollo, after, swearing, revenge, a, devastated, niobe, fled, to, mount, sipylos, in, asia, minor, and, turned, into, stone, as, she, wept, her, tears, formed, the, river, achelous, zeus, had, turned, all, the, people, of, thebes, to, stone, and, so, no, one, buried, the, niobids, until, the, ninth, day, after, their, death, when, the, gods, themselves, entombed, them, when, chloris, married, and, had, children, apollo, granted, her, son, nestor, the, years, he, had, taken, away, from, the, niobids, hence, nestor, was, able, to, live, for, 3, generations, once, apollo, and, poseidon, served, under, the, trojan, king, laomedon, in, accordance, with, zeus, words, apollodorus, states, that, the, gods, willingly, went, to, the, king, disguised, as, humans, in, order, to, check, his, hubris, apollo, guarded, the, cattle, of, laomedon, in, the, valleys, of, mount, ida, while, poseidon, built, the, walls, of, troy, other, versions, make, both, apollo, and, poseidon, the, builders, of, the, wall, in, ovid, s, account, apollo, completes, his, task, by, playing, his, tunes, on, his, lyre, in, pindar, s, odes, the, gods, took, a, mortal, named, aeacus, as, their, assistant, when, the, work, was, completed, three, snakes, rushed, against, the, wall, and, though, the, two, that, attacked, the, sections, of, the, wall, built, by, the, gods, fell, down, dead, the, third, forced, its, way, into, the, city, through, the, portion, of, the, wall, built, by, aeacus, apollo, immediately, prophesied, that, troy, would, fall, at, the, hands, of, aeacus, s, descendants, the, aeacidae, i, e, his, son, telamon, joined, heracles, when, he, sieged, the, city, during, laomedon, s, rule, later, his, great, grandson, neoptolemus, was, present, in, the, wooden, horse, that, leads, to, the, downfall, of, troy, however, the, king, not, only, refused, to, give, the, gods, the, wages, he, had, promised, but, also, threatened, to, bind, their, feet, and, hands, and, sell, them, as, slaves, angered, by, the, unpaid, labour, and, the, insults, apollo, infected, the, city, with, a, pestilence, and, poseidon, sent, the, sea, monster, cetus, to, deliver, the, city, from, it, laomedon, had, to, sacrifice, his, daughter, hesione, who, would, later, be, saved, by, heracles, during, his, stay, in, troy, apollo, had, a, lover, named, ourea, who, was, a, nymph, and, daughter, of, poseidon, together, they, had, a, son, named, ileus, whom, apollo, loved, dearly, apollo, sided, with, the, trojans, during, the, trojan, war, waged, by, the, greeks, against, the, trojans, during, the, war, the, greek, king, agamemnon, captured, chryseis, the, daughter, of, apollo, s, priest, chryses, and, refused, to, return, her, angered, by, this, apollo, shot, arrows, infected, with, the, plague, into, the, greek, encampment, he, demanded, that, they, return, the, girl, and, the, achaeans, greeks, complied, indirectly, causing, the, anger, of, achilles, which, is, the, theme, of, the, iliad, receiving, the, aegis, from, zeus, apollo, entered, the, battlefield, as, per, his, father, s, command, causing, great, terror, to, the, enemy, with, his, war, cry, he, pushed, the, greeks, back, and, destroyed, many, of, the, soldiers, he, is, described, as, the, rouser, of, armies, because, he, rallied, the, trojan, army, when, they, were, falling, apart, when, zeus, allowed, the, other, gods, to, get, involved, in, the, war, apollo, was, provoked, by, poseidon, to, a, duel, however, apollo, declined, to, fight, him, saying, that, he, would, not, fight, his, uncle, for, the, sake, of, mortals, when, the, greek, hero, diomedes, injured, the, trojan, hero, aeneas, aphrodite, tried, to, rescue, him, but, diomedes, injured, her, as, well, apollo, then, enveloped, aeneas, in, a, cloud, to, protect, him, he, repelled, the, attacks, diomedes, made, on, him, and, gave, the, hero, a, stern, warning, to, abstain, from, attacking, a, god, aeneas, was, then, taken, to, pergamos, a, sacred, spot, in, troy, where, he, was, healed, after, the, death, of, sarpedon, a, son, of, zeus, apollo, rescued, the, corpse, from, the, battlefield, as, per, his, father, s, wish, and, cleaned, it, he, then, gave, it, to, sleep, hypnos, and, death, thanatos, apollo, had, also, once, convinced, athena, to, stop, the, war, for, that, day, so, that, the, warriors, can, relieve, themselves, for, a, while, the, trojan, hero, hector, who, according, to, some, was, the, god, s, own, son, by, hecuba, was, favored, by, apollo, when, he, got, severely, injured, apollo, healed, him, and, encouraged, him, to, take, up, his, arms, during, a, duel, with, achilles, when, hector, was, about, to, lose, apollo, hid, hector, in, a, cloud, of, mist, to, save, him, when, the, greek, warrior, patroclus, tried, to, get, into, the, fort, of, troy, he, was, stopped, by, apollo, encouraging, hector, to, attack, patroclus, apollo, stripped, the, armour, of, the, greek, warrior, and, broke, his, weapons, patroclus, was, eventually, killed, by, hector, at, last, after, hector, s, fated, death, apollo, protected, his, corpse, from, achilles, attempt, to, mutilate, it, by, creating, a, magical, cloud, over, the, corpse, shielding, it, from, the, rays, of, the, sun, apollo, held, a, grudge, against, achilles, throughout, the, war, because, achilles, had, murdered, his, son, tenes, before, the, war, began, and, brutally, assassinated, his, son, troilus, in, his, own, temple, not, only, did, apollo, save, hector, from, achilles, he, also, tricked, achilles, by, disguising, himself, as, a, trojan, warrior, and, driving, him, away, from, the, gates, he, foiled, achilles, attempt, to, mutilate, hector, s, dead, body, finally, apollo, caused, achilles, death, by, guiding, an, arrow, shot, by, paris, into, achilles, heel, in, some, versions, apollo, himself, killed, achilles, by, taking, the, disguise, of, paris, apollo, helped, many, trojan, warriors, including, agenor, polydamas, glaucus, in, the, battlefield, though, he, greatly, favored, the, trojans, apollo, was, bound, to, follow, the, orders, of, zeus, and, served, his, father, loyally, during, the, war, apollo, kourotrophos, is, the, god, who, nurtures, and, protects, children, and, the, young, especially, boys, he, oversees, their, education, and, their, passage, into, adulthood, education, is, said, to, have, originated, from, apollo, and, the, muses, many, myths, have, him, train, his, children, it, was, a, custom, for, boys, to, cut, and, dedicate, their, long, hair, to, apollo, after, reaching, adulthood, chiron, the, abandoned, centaur, was, fostered, by, apollo, who, instructed, him, in, medicine, prophecy, archery,

the, name, vulturius, immediately, after, his, birth, apollo, demanded, a, lyre, and, invented, the, paean, thus, becoming, the, god, of, music, as, the, divine, singer, he, is, the, patron, of, poets, singers, and, musicians, the, invention, of, string, music, is, attributed, to, him, plato, said, that, the, innate, ability, of, humans, to, take, delight, in, music, rhythm, and, harmony, is, the, gift, of, apollo, and, the, muses, according, to, socrates, ancient, greeks, believed, that, apollo, is, the, god, who, directs, the, harmony, and, makes, all, things, move, together, both, for, the, gods, and, the, humans, for, this, reason, he, was, called, homopolon, before, the, homo, was, replaced, by, a, apollo, s, harmonious, music, delivered, people, from, their, pain, and, hence, like, dionysus, he, is, also, called, the, liberator, the, swans, which, were, considered, to, be, the, most, musical, among, the, birds, were, believed, to, be, the, singers, of, apollo, they, are, apollo, s, sacred, birds, and, acted, as, his, vehicle, during, his, travel, to, hyperborea, aelian, says, that, when, the, singers, would, sing, hymns, to, apollo, the, swans, would, join, the, chant, in, unison, among, the, pythagoreans, the, study, of, mathematics, and, music, were, connected, to, the, worship, of, apollo, their, principal, deity, their, belief, was, that, music, purifies, the, soul, just, as, medicine, purifies, the, body, they, also, believed, that, music, was, delegated, to, the, same, mathematical, laws, of, harmony, as, the, mechanics, of, the, cosmos, evolving, into, an, idea, known, as, the, music, of, the, spheres, apollo, appears, as, the, companion, of, the, muses, and, as, musagetes, leader, of, muses, he, leads, them, in, dance, they, spend, their, time, on, parnassus, which, is, one, of, their, sacred, places, apollo, is, also, the, lover, of, the, muses, and, by, them, he, became, the, father, of, famous, musicians, like, orpheus, and, linus, apollo, is, often, found, delighting, the, immortal, gods, with, his, songs, and, music, on, the, lyre, in, his, role, as, the, god, of, banquets, he, was, always, present, to, play, music, at, weddings, of, the, gods, like, the, marriage, of, eros, and, psyche, peleus, and, thetis, he, is, a, frequent, guest, of, the, bacchanalia, and, many, ancient, ceramics, depict, him, being, at, ease, amidst, the, maenads, and, satyrs, apollo, also, participated, in, musical, contests, when, challenged, by, others, he, was, the, victor, in, all, those, contests, but, he, tended, to, punish, his, opponents, severely, for, their, hubris, the, invention, of, the, lyre, is, attributed, either, to, hermes, or, to, apollo, himself, distinctions, have, been, made, that, hermes, invented, lyre, made, of, tortoise, shell, whereas, the, lyre, apollo, invented, was, a, regular, lyre, myths, tell, that, the, infant, hermes, stole, a, number, of, apollo, s, cows, and, took, them, to, a, cave, in, the, woods, near, pylos, covering, their, tracks, in, the, cave, he, found, a, tortoise, and, killed, it, then, removed, the, insides, he, used, one, of, the, cow, s, intestines, and, the, tortoise, shell, and, made, his, lyre, upon, discovering, the, theft, apollo, confronted, hermes, and, asked, him, to, return, his, cattle, when, hermes, acted, innocent, apollo, took, the, matter, to, zeus, zeus, having, seen, the, events, sided, with, apollo, and, ordered, hermes, to, return, the, cattle, hermes, then, began, to, play, music, on, the, lyre, he, had, invented, apollo, fell, in, love, with, the, instrument, and, offered, to, exchange, the, cattle, for, the, lyre, hence, apollo, then, became, the, master, of, the, lyre, according, to, other, versions, apollo, had, invented, the, lyre, himself, whose, strings, he, tore, in, repenting, of, the, excess, punishment, he, had, given, to, marsyas, hermes, lyre, therefore, would, be, a, reinvention, once, pan, had, the, audacity, to, compare, his, music, with, that, of, apollo, and, to, challenge, the, god, of, music, to, a, contest, the, mountain, god, tmolus, was, chosen, to, umpire, pan, blew, on, his, pipes, and, with, his, rustic, melody, gave, great, satisfaction, to, himself, and, his, faithful, follower, midas, who, happened, to, be, present, then, apollo, struck, the, strings, of, his, lyre, it, was, so, beautiful, that, tmolus, at, once, awarded, the, victory, to, apollo, and, everyone, was, pleased, with, the, judgement, only, midas, dissented, and, questioned, the, justice, of, the, award, apollo, did, not, want, to, suffer, such, a, depraved, pair, of, ears, any, longer, and, caused, them, to, become, the, ears, of, a, donkey, marsyas, was, a, satyr, who, was, punished, by, apollo, for, his, hubris, he, had, found, an, aulos, on, the, ground, tossed, away, after, being, invented, by, athena, because, it, made, her, cheeks, puffy, athena, had, also, placed, a, curse, upon, the, instrument, that, whoever, would, pick, it, up, would, be, severely, punished, when, marsyas, played, the, flute, everyone, became, frenzied, with, joy, this, led, marsyas, to, think, that, he, was, better, than, apollo, and, he, challenged, the, god, to, a, musical, contest, the, contest, was, judged, by, the, muses, or, the, nymphs, of, nysa, athena, was, also, present, to, witness, the, contest, marsyas, taunted, apollo, for, wearing, his, hair, long, for, having, a, fair, face, and, smooth, body, for, his, skill, in, so, many, arts, he, also, further, said, his, hair, is, smooth, and, made, into, tufts, and, curls, that, fall, about, his, brow, and, hang, before, his, face, his, body, is, fair, from, head, to, foot, his, limbs, shine, bright, his, tongue, gives, oracles, and, he, is, equally, eloquent, in, prose, or, verse, propose, which, you, will, what, of, his, robes, so, fine, in, texture, so, soft, to, the, touch, aglow, with, purple, what, of, his, lyre, that, flashes, gold, gleams, white, with, ivory, and, shimmers, with, rainbow, gems, what, of, his, song, so, cunning, and, so, sweet, nay, all, these, allurements, suit, with, naught, save, luxury, to, virtue, they, bring, shame, alone, the, muses, and, athena, sniggered, at, this, comment, the, contestants, agreed, to, take, turns, displaying, their, skills, and, the, rule, was, that, the, victor, could, do, whatever, he, wanted, to, the, loser, according, to, one, account, after, the, first, round, they, both, were, deemed, equal, by, the, nysiads, but, in, the, next, round, apollo, decided, to, play, on, his, lyre, and, add, his, melodious, voice, to, his, performance, marsyas, argued, against, this, saying, that, apollo, would, have, an, advantage, and, accused, apollo, of, cheating, but, apollo, replied, that, since, marsyas, played, the, flute, which, needed, air, blown, from, the, throat, it, was, similar, to, singing, and, that, either, they, both, should, get, an, equal, chance, to, combine, their, skills, or, none, of, them, should, use, their, mouths, at, all, the, nymphs, decided, that, apollo, s, argument, was, just, apollo, then, played, his, lyre, and, sang, at, the, same, time, mesmerising, the, audience, marsyas, could, not, do, this, apollo, was, declared, the, winner, and, angered, with, marsyas, haughtiness, and, his, accusations, decided, to, flay, the, satyr, according, to, another, account, marsyas, played, his, flute, out, of, tune, at, one, point, and, accepted, his, defeat, out, of, shame, he, assigned, to, himself, the, punishment, of, being, skinned, for, a, wine, sack, another, variation, is, that, apollo, played, his, instrument, upside, down, marsyas, could, not, do, this, with, his, instrument, so, the, muses, who, were, the, judges, declared, apollo, the, winner, apollo, hung, marsyas, from, a, tree, to, flay, him, apollo, flayed, the, limbs, of, marsyas, alive, in, a, cave, near, celaenae, in, phrygia, for, his, hubris, to, challenge, a, god, he, then, gave, the, rest, of, his, body, for, proper, burial, and, nailed, marsyas, flayed, skin, to, a, nearby, pine, tree, as, a, lesson, to, the, others, marsyas, blood, turned, into, the, river, marsyas, but, apollo, soon, repented, and, being, distressed, at, what, he, had, done, he, tore, the, strings, of, his, lyre, and, threw, it, away, the, lyre, was, later, discovered, by, the, muses, and, apollo, s, sons, linus, and, orpheus, the, muses, fixed, the, middle, string, linus, the, string, struck, with, the, forefinger, and, orpheus, the, lowest, string, and, the, one, next, to, it, they, took, it, back, to, apollo, but, the, god, who, had, decided, to, stay, away, from, music, for, a, while, laid, away, both, the, lyre, and, the, pipes, at, delphi, and, joined, cybele, in, her, wanderings, to, as, far, as, hyperborea, cinyras, was, a, ruler, of, cyprus, who, was, a, friend, of, agamemnon, cinyras, promised, to, assist, agamemnon, in, the, trojan, war, but, did, not, keep, his, promise, agamemnon, cursed, cinyras, he, invoked, apollo, and, asked, the, god, to, avenge, the, broken, promise, apollo, then, had, a, lyre, playing, contest, with, cinyras, and, defeated, him, either, cinyras, committed, suicide, when, he, lost, or, was, killed, by, apollo, apollo, functions, as, the, patron, and, protector, of, sailors, one, of, the, duties, he, shares, with,

confronted, by, apollo, and, artemis, who, were, angered, at, heracles, for, this, act, however, heracles, soothed, the, goddess, and, explained, his, situation, to, her, after, much, pleading, artemis, permitted, him, to, take, the, hind, and, told, him, to, return, it, later, after, he, was, freed, from, his, servitude, to, eurystheus, heracles, fell, in, conflict, with, iphytus, a, prince, of, oechalia, and, murdered, him, soon, after, he, contracted, a, terrible, disease, he, consulted, the, oracle, of, apollo, once, again, in, the, hope, of, ridding, himself, of, the, disease, the, pythia, however, denied, to, give, any, prophesy, in, anger, heracles, snatched, the, sacred, tripod, and, started, walking, away, intending, to, start, his, own, oracle, however, apollo, did, not, tolerate, this, and, stopped, heracles, a, duel, ensued, between, them, artemis, rushed, to, support, apollo, while, athena, supported, heracles, soon, zeus, threw, his, thunderbolt, between, the, fighting, brothers, and, separated, them, he, reprimanded, heracles, for, this, act, of, violation, and, asked, apollo, to, give, a, solution, to, heracles, apollo, then, ordered, the, hero, to, serve, under, omphale, queen, of, lydia, for, one, year, in, order, to, purify, himself, after, their, reconciliation, apollo, and, heracles, together, founded, the, city, of, gythion, a, long, time, ago, there, were, three, kinds, of, human, beings, male, descended, from, the, sun, female, descended, from, the, earth, and, androgynous, descended, from, the, moon, each, human, being, was, completely, round, with, four, arms, and, four, legs, two, identical, faces, on, opposite, sides, of, a, head, with, four, ears, and, all, else, to, match, they, were, powerful, and, unruly, otis, and, ephialtes, even, dared, to, scale, mount, olympus, to, check, their, insolence, zeus, devised, a, plan, to, humble, them, and, improve, their, manners, instead, of, completely, destroying, them, he, cut, them, all, in, two, and, asked, apollo, to, make, necessary, repairs, giving, humans, the, individual, shape, they, still, have, now, apollo, turned, their, heads, and, necks, around, towards, their, wounds, he, pulled, together, their, skin, at, the, abdomen, and, sewed, the, skin, together, at, the, middle, of, it, this, is, what, we, call, navel, today, he, smoothened, the, wrinkles, and, shaped, the, chest, but, he, made, sure, to, leave, a, few, wrinkles, on, the, abdomen, and, around, the, navel, so, that, they, might, be, reminded, of, their, punishment, as, he, cut, them, one, after, another, he, bade, apollo, give, the, face, and, the, half, of, the, neck, a, turn, apollo, was, also, bidden, to, heal, their, wounds, and, compose, their, forms, so, apollo, gave, a, turn, to, the, face, and, pulled, the, skin, from, the, sides, all, over, that, which, in, our, language, is, called, the, belly, like, the, purses, which, draw, in, and, he, made, one, mouth, at, the, centre, which, he, fastened, in, a, knot, the, same, which, is, called, the, navel, he, also, moulded, the, breast, and, took, out, most, of, the, wrinkles, much, as, a, shoemaker, might, smooth, leather, upon, a, last, he, left, a, few, wrinkles, however, in, the, region, of, the, belly, and, navel, as, a, memorial, of, the, primeval, state, leukatas, was, believed, to, be, a, white, colored, rock, jutting, out, from, the, island, of, leukas, into, the, sea, it, was, present, in, the, sanctuary, of, apollo, leukates, a, leap, from, this, rock, was, believed, to, have, put, an, end, to,

prophecies, the, sibyl, of, cumae, like, cassandra, promised, apollo, her, love, if, he, would, give, her, a, boon, the, sibyl, took, a, handful, of, sand, and, asked, apollo, to, grant, her, years, of, life, as, many, as, the, grains, of, sand, she, held, in, her, hands, apollo, granted, her, wish, but, sibyl, went, back, on, her, word, although, sibyl, did, live, an, extended, life, as, apollo,

hellenic, period, their, relationship, was, described, as, the, one, between, husband, and, wife, and, there, seems, to, have, been, a, tradition, which, actually, described, artemis, as, the, wife, of, apollo, however, this, relationship, was, never, sexual, but, spiritual, which, is, why, they, both, are, seen, being, unmarried, in, the, hellenic, period, artemis, like, her, brother, is, armed, with, a, bow, and, arrows, she, is, the, cause, of, sudden, deaths, of, women, she, also, is, the, protector, of, the, young, especially, girls, though, she, has, nothing, to, do, with, oracles,

regarded, as, identical, with, the, sun, or, helios, artemis, was, naturally, regarded, as, selene, or, the, moon, hecate, the, goddess, of, witchcraft, and, magic, is, the, chthonic, counterpart, of, apollo, they, both, are, cousins, since, their, mothers, leto, and, asteria, are, sisters, one, of, apollo, s, epithets, hecatos, is, the, masculine, form, of, hecate, and, both, names, mean, working, from, afar, while, apollo, presided, over, the, prophetic, powers, and, magic, of, light, and, heaven, hecate, presided, over, the, prophetic, powers, and, magic, of, night, and, chthonian, darkness, if, hecate, is, the, gate, keeper, apollo, agyieus, is, the, door, keeper, hecate, is, the, goddess, of, crossroads, and, apollo, is, the, god, and, protector, of, streets, the, oldest, evidence, found, for, hecate, s, worship, is, at, apollo, s, temple, in, miletos, there, hecate, was, taken, to, be, apollo, s, sister, counterpart, in, the, absence, of, artemis, hecate, s, lunar, nature, makes, her, the, goddess, of, the, waning, moon, and, contrasts, and, complements, at, the, same, time, apollo, s, solar, nature, as, a, deity, of, knowledge, and, great, power, apollo, was, seen, being, the, male, counterpart, of, athena, being, zeus, favorite, children, they, were, given, more, powers, and, duties, apollo, and, athena, often, took, up, the, role, of, protectors, of, cities, and, were, patrons, of, some, of, the, important, cities, athena, was, the, principal, goddess, of, athens, apollo, was, the, principal, god, of, sparta, as, patrons, of, arts, apollo, and, athena, were, companions, of, the, muses, the, former, a, much, more, frequent, companion, than, the, latter, apollo, was, sometimes, called, the, son, of, athena, and, hephaestus, in, the, trojan, war, as, zeus, executive, apollo, is, seen, holding, the, aegis, like, athena, usually, does, apollo, s, decisions, were, usually, approved, by, his, sister, athena, and, they, both, worked, to, establish, the, law, and, order, set, forth, by, zeus, in, aeschylus, oresteia, trilogy, clytemnestra, kills, her, husband, king, agamemnon, because, he, had, sacrificed, their, daughter, iphigenia, to, proceed, forward, with, the, trojan, war, apollo, gives, an, order, through, the, oracle, at, delphi, that, agamemnon, s, son, orestes, is, to, kill, clytemnestra, and, aegisthus, her, lover, orestes, and, pylades, carry, out, the, revenge, and, consequently, orestes, is, pursued, by, the, erinyes, or, furies, female, personifications, of, vengeance, apollo, and, the, furies, argue, about, whether, the, matricide, was, justified, apollo, holds, that, the, bond, of, marriage, is, sacred, and, orestes, was, avenging, his, father, whereas, the, erinyes, say, that, the, bond, of, blood, between, mother, and, son, is, more, meaningful, than, the, bond, of, marriage, they, invade, his, temple, and, he, drives, them, away, he, says, that, the, matter, should, be, brought, before, athena, apollo, promises, to, protect, orestes, as, orestes, has, become, apollo, s, supplicant, apollo, advocates, orestes, at, the, trial, and, ultimately, athena, rules, in, favor, of, apollo, the, roman, worship, of, apollo, was, adopted, from, the, greeks, as, a, quintessentially, greek, god, apollo, had, no, direct, roman, equivalent, although, later, roman, poets, often, referred, to, him, as, phoebus, there, was, a, tradition, that, the, delphic, oracle, was, consulted, as, early, as, the, period, of, the, kings, of, rome, during, the, reign, of, tarquinius, superbus, on, the, occasion, of, a, pestilence, in, the, 430s, bce, apollo, s, first, temple, at, rome, was, established, in, the, flaminian, fields, replacing, an, older, cult, site, there, known, as, the, apollinare, during, the, second, punic, war, in, 212, bce, the, ludi, apollinares, apollonian, games, were, instituted, in, his, honor, on, the, instructions, of, a, prophecy, attributed, to, one, marcius, in, the, time, of, augustus, who, considered, himself, under, the, special, protection, of, apollo, and, was, even, said, to, be, his, son, his, worship, developed, and, he, became, one, of, the, chief, gods, of, rome, after, the, battle, of, actium, which, was, fought, near, a, sanctuary, of, apollo, augustus, enlarged, apollo, s, temple, dedicated, a, portion, of, the, spoils, to, him, and, instituted, quinquennial, games, in, his, honour, he, also, erected, a, new, temple, to, the, god, on, the, palatine, hill, sacrifices, and, prayers, on, the, palatine, to, apollo, and, diana, formed, the,

and, was, one, of, the, four, great, panhellenic, games, also, of, major, importance, was, the, delia, held, every, four, years, on, delos, athenian, annual, festivals, included, the, boedromia, metageitnia, pyanepsia, and, thargelia, spartan, annual, festivals, were, the, carneia, and, the, hyacinthia, thebes, every, nine, years, held, the, daphnephoria, apollo, s, most, common, attributes, were, the, bow, and, arrow, other, attributes, of, his, included, the, kithara, an, advanced, version, of, the, common, lyre, the, plectrum, and, the, sword, another, common, emblem, was, the, sacrificial, tripod, representing, his, prophetic, powers, the, pythian, games, were, held, in, apollo, s, honor, every, four, years, at, delphi, the, bay, laurel, plant, was, used, in, expiatory, sacrifices, and, in, making, the, crown, of, victory, at, these, games, the, palm, tree, was, also, sacred, to, apollo, because, he, had, been, born, under, one, in, delos, animals, sacred, to, apollo, included, wolves, dolphins, roe, deer, swans, cicadas, symbolizing, music, and, song, ravens, hawks, crows, apollo, had, hawks, and, crows, as, his, messengers, snakes, referencing, apollo, s, function, as, the, god, of, prophecy, mice, and, griffins, mythical, eagle, lion, hybrids, of, eastern, origin, homer, and, porphyry, wrote, that, apollo, had, a, hawk, as, his, messenger, in, many, myths, apollo, is, transformed, into, a, hawk, in, addition, claudius, aelianus, wrote, that, in, ancient, egypt, people, believed, that, hawks, were, sacred, to, the, god, and, that, according, to, the, ministers, of, apollo, in, egypt, there, were, certain, men, called, hawk, keepers, who, fed, and, tended, the, hawks, belonging, to, the, god, eusebius, wrote, that, the, second, appearance, of, the, moon, is, held, sacred, in, the, city, of, apollo, in, egypt, and, that, the, city, s, symbol, is, a, man, with, a, hawklike, face, horus, claudius, aelianus, wrote, that, egyptians, called, apollo, horus, in, their, own, language, as, god, of, colonization, apollo, gave, oracular, guidance, on, colonies, especially, during, the, height, of, colonization, 750, 550, bce, according, to, greek, tradition, he, helped, cretan, or, arcadian, colonists, found, the, city, of, troy, however, this, story, may, reflect, a, cultural, influence, which, had, the, reverse, direction, hittite, cuneiform, texts, mention, an, asia, minor, god, called, appaliunas, or, apalunas, in, connection, with, the, city, of, wilusa, attested, in, hittite, inscriptions, which, is, now, generally, regarded, as, being, identical, with, the, greek, ilion, by, most, scholars, in, this, interpretation, apollo, s, title, of, lykegenes, can, simply, be, read, as, born, in, lycia, which, effectively,
