horus, h, r, s, also, known, as, hor, h, r, in, ancient, egyptian, is, one, of, the, most, significant, ancient, egyptian, deities, who, served, many, functions, most, notably, as, the, god, of, kingship, healing, protection, the, sun, and, the, sky, he, was, worshipped, from, at, least, the, late, prehistoric, egypt, until, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, and, roman, egypt, different, forms, of, horus, are, recorded, in, history, and, these, are, treated, as, distinct, gods, by, egyptologists, these, various, forms, may, be, different, manifestations, of, the, same, multi, layered, deity, in, which, certain, attributes, or, syncretic, relationships, are, emphasized, not, necessarily, in, opposition, but, complementary, to, one, another, consistent, with, how, the, ancient, egyptians, viewed, the, multiple, facets, of, reality, he, was, most, often, depicted, as, a, falcon, most, likely, a, lanner, falcon, or, peregrine, falcon, or, as, a, man, with, a, falcon, head, the, earliest, recorded, form, of, horus, is, the, tutelary, deity, of, nekhen, in, upper, egypt, who, is, the, first, known, national, god, specifically, related, to, the, ruling, pharaoh, who, in, time, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, manifestation, of, horus, in, life, and, osiris, in, death, the, most, commonly, encountered, family, relationship, describes, horus, as, the, son, of, isis, and, osiris, and, he, plays, a, key, role, in, the, osiris, myth, as, osiris, s, heir, and, the, rival, to, set, the, murderer, and, brother, of, osiris, in, another, tradition, hathor, is, regarded, as, his, mother, and, sometimes, as, his, wife, claudius, aelianus, wrote, that, egyptians, called, the, god, apollo, horus, in, their, own, language, however, plutarch, elaborating, further, on, the, same, tradition, reported, by, the, greeks, specified, that, the, one, horus, whom, the, egyptians, equated, with, the, greek, apollo, was, in, fact, horus, the, elder, who, is, distinct, from, horus, the, son, of, osiris, and, isis, that, would, make, him, the, younger, horus, is, recorded, in, egyptian, hieroglyphs, as, r, w, falcon, the, original, pronunciation, has, been, reconstructed, as, a, uw, in, old, egyptian, and, early, middle, egyptian, a, in, later, middle, egyptian, and, o, in, late, egyptian, additional, meanings, are, thought, to, have, been, the, distant, one, or, one, who, is, above, over, as, the, language, changed, over, time, it, appeared, in, coptic, varieties, variously, as, h, r, or, o, and, was, adopted, into, ancient, greek, as, h, ros, pronounced, at, the, time, as, h, ros, it, also, survives, in, late, egyptian, and, coptic, theophoric, name, forms, such, as, siese, son, of, isis, and, harsiese, horus, son, of, isis, the, pharaoh, was, associated, with, many, specific, deities, he, was, identified, directly, with, horus, who, represented, kingship, itself, and, was, seen, as, a, protector, of, the, pharaoh, and, he, was, seen, as, the, son, of, ra, who, ruled, and, regulated, nature, as, the, pharaoh, ruled, and, regulated, society, the, pyramid, texts, c, 2400, 2300, bce, describe, the, nature, of, the, pharaoh, in, different, characters, as, both, horus, and, osiris, the, pharaoh, as, horus, in, life, became, the, pharaoh, as, osiris, in, death, where, he, was, united, with, the, other, gods, new, incarnations, of, horus, succeeded, the, deceased, pharaoh, on, earth, in, the, form, of, new, pharaohs, b, c, d, f, g, h, i, k, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, u, w, the, lineage, of, horus, the, eventual, product, of, unions, between, the, children, of, atum, may, have, been, a, means, to, explain, and, justify, pharaonic, power, the, gods, produced, by, atum, were, all, representative, of, cosmic, and, terrestrial, forces, in, egyptian, life, by, identifying, horus, as, the, offspring, of, these, forces, then, identifying, him, with, atum, himself, and, finally, identifying, the, pharaoh, with, horus, the, pharaoh, theologically, had, dominion, over, all, the, world, in, one, tale, horus, is, born, to, the, goddess, isis, after, she, retrieved, all, the, dismembered, body, parts, of, her, murdered, husband, osiris, except, his, penis, which, was, thrown, into, the, nile, and, eaten, by, a, catfish, medjed, or, sometimes, depicted, as, instead, by, a, crab, and, according, to, plutarch, s, account, used, her, magic, powers, to, resurrect, osiris, and, fashion, a, phallus, to, conceive, her, son, older, egyptian, accounts, have, the, penis, of, osiris, surviving, after, becoming, pregnant, with, horus, isis, fled, to, the, nile, delta, marshlands, to, hide, from, her, brother, set, who, jealously, killed, osiris, and, who, she, knew, would, want, to, kill, their, son, there, isis, bore, a, divine, son, horus, as, birth, death, and, rebirth, are, recurrent, themes, in, egyptian, lore, and, cosmology, it, is, not, particularly, strange, that, horus, also, is, the, brother, of, osiris, and, isis, by, nut, and, geb, together, with, nephthys, and, set, this, elder, horus, is, called, hrw, wr, hourou, ur, as, opposed, to, hrw, p, khrd, the, younger, horus, at, some, point, adopted, by, the, greeks, as, harpocrates, since, horus, was, said, to, be, the, sky, he, was, considered, to, also, contain, the, sun, and, moon, egyptians, believed, that, the, sun, was, his, right, eye, and, the, moon, his, left, and, that, they, traversed, the, sky, when, he, a, falcon, flew, across, it, later, the, reason, that, the, moon, was, not, as, bright, as, the, sun, was, explained, by, a, tale, known, as, the, contendings, of, horus, and, seth, in, this, tale, it, was, said, that, seth, the, patron, of, upper, egypt, and, horus, the, patron, of, lower, egypt, had, battled, for, egypt, brutally, with, neither, side, victorious, until, eventually, the, gods, sided, with, horus, as, horus, was, the, ultimate, victor, he, became, known, as, r, w, or, horus, the, great, but, more, usually, translated, as, horus, the, elder, in, the, struggle, set, had, lost, a, testicle, and, horus, eye, was, gouged, out, horus, was, occasionally, shown, in, art, as, a, naked, boy, with, a, finger, in, his, mouth, sitting, on, a, lotus, with, his, mother, in, the, form, of, a, youth, horus, was, referred, to, as, nfr, r, w, good, horus, transliterated, neferhor, nephoros, or, nopheros, reconstructed, as, na, firu, a, ruw, the, eye, of, horus, is, an, ancient, egyptian, symbol, of, protection, and, royal, power, from, deities, in, this, case, from, horus, or, ra, the, symbol, is, seen, on, images, of, horus, mother, isis, and, on, other, deities, associated, with, her, in, the, egyptian, language, the, word, for, this, symbol, was, wedjat, w, t, it, was, the, eye, of, one, of, the, earliest, egyptian, deities, wadjet, who, later, became, associated, with, bastet, mut, and, hathor, as, well, wadjet, was, a, solar, deity, and, this, symbol, began, as, her, all, seeing, eye, in, early, artwork, hathor, is, also, depicted, with, this, eye, funerary, amulets, were, often, made, in, the, shape, of, the, eye, of, horus, the, wedjat, or, eye, of, horus, is, the, central, element, of, seven, gold, faience, carnelian, and, lapis, lazuli, bracelets, found, on, the, mummy, of, shoshenq, ii, the, wedjat, was, intended, to, protect, the, king, in, the, afterlife, and, to, ward, off, evil, egyptian, and, near, eastern, sailors, would, frequently, paint, the, symbol, on, the, bow, of, their, vessel, to, ensure, safe, sea, travel, horus, was, also, thought, to, protect, the, sky, horus, was, told, by, his, mother, isis, to, protect, the, people, of, egypt, from, set, the, god, of, the, desert, who, had, killed, horus, father, osiris, horus, had, many, battles, with, set, not, only, to, avenge, his, father, but, to, choose, the, rightful, ruler, of, egypt, in, these, battles, horus, came, to, be, associated, with, lower, egypt, and, became, its, patron, according, to, the, contendings, of, horus, and, seth, set, is, depicted, as, trying, to, prove, his, dominance, by, seducing, horus, and, then, having, sexual, intercourse, with, him, however, horus, places, his, hand, between, his, thighs, and, catches, set, s, semen, then, subsequently, throws, it, in, the, river, so, that, he, may, not, be, said, to, have, been, inseminated, by, set, horus, or, isis, herself, in, some, versions, then, deliberately, spreads, his, semen, on, some, lettuce, which, was, set, s, favourite, food, after, set, had, eaten, the, lettuce, they, went, to, the, gods, to, try, to, settle, the, argument, over, the, rule, of, egypt, the, gods, first, listened, to, set, s, claim, of, dominance, over, horus, and, call, his, semen, forth, but, it, answered, from, the, river, invalidating, his, claim, then, the, gods, listened, to, horus, claim, of, having, dominated, set, and, call, his, semen, forth, and, it, answered, from, inside, set, however, set, still, refused, to, relent, and, the, other, gods, were, getting, tired, from, over, eighty, years, of, fighting, and, challenges, horus, and, set, challenged, each, other, to, a, boat, race, where, they, each, raced, in, a, boat, made, of, stone, horus, and, set, agreed, and, the, race, started, but, horus, had, an, edge, his, boat, was, made, of, wood, painted, to, resemble, stone, rather, than, true, stone, set, s, boat, being, made, of, heavy, stone, sank, but, horus, did, not, horus, then, won, the, race, and, set, stepped, down, and, officially, gave, horus, the, throne, of, egypt, upon, becoming, king, after, set, s, defeat, horus, gives, offerings, to, his, deceased, father, osiris, thus, reviving, and, sustaining, him, in, the, afterlife, after, the, new, kingdom, set, was, still, considered, the, lord, of, the, desert, and, its, oases, in, many, versions, of, the, story, horus, and, set, divide, the, realm, between, them, this, division, can, be, equated, with, any, of, several, fundamental, dualities, that, the, egyptians, saw, in, their, world, horus, may, receive, the, fertile, lands, around, the, nile, the, core, of, egyptian, civilization, in, which, case, set, takes, the, barren, desert, or, the, foreign, lands, that, are, associated, with, it, horus, may, rule, the, earth, while, set, dwells, in, the, sky, and, each, god, may, take, one, of, the, two, traditional, halves, of, the, country, upper, and, lower, egypt, in, which, case, either, god, may, be, connected, with, either, region, yet, in, the, memphite, theology, geb, as, judge, first, apportions, the, realm, between, the, claimants, and, then, reverses, himself, awarding, sole, control, to, horus, in, this, peaceable, union, horus, and, set, are, reconciled, and, the, dualities, that, they, represent, have, been, resolved, into, a, united, whole, through, this, resolution, the, order, is, restored, after, the, tumultuous, conflict, egyptologists, have, often, tried, to, connect, the, conflict, between, the, two, gods, with, political, events, early, in, egypt, s, history, or, prehistory, the, cases, in, which, the, combatants, divide, the, kingdom, and, the, frequent, association, of, the, paired, horus, and, set, with, the, union, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, suggest, that, the, two, deities, represent, some, kind, of, division, within, the, country, egyptian, tradition, and, archaeological, evidence, indicate, that, egypt, was, united, at, the, beginning, of, its, history, when, an, upper, egyptian, kingdom, in, the, south, conquered, lower, egypt, in, the, north, the, upper, egyptian, rulers, called, themselves, followers, of, horus, and, horus, became, the, tutelary, deity, of, the, unified, polity, and, its, kings, yet, horus, and, set, cannot, be, easily, equated, with, the, two, halves, of, the, country, both, deities, had, several, cult, centers, in, each, region, and, horus, is, often, associated, with, lower, egypt, and, set, with, upper, egypt, other, events, may, have, also, affected, the, myth, before, even, upper, egypt, had, a, single, ruler, two, of, its, major, cities, were, nekhen, in, the, far, south, and, nagada, many, miles, to, the, north, the, rulers, of, nekhen, where, horus, was, the, patron, deity, are, generally, believed, to, have, unified, upper, egypt, including, nagada, under, their, sway, set, was, associated, with, nagada, so, it, is, possible, that, the, divine, conflict, dimly, reflects, an, enmity, between, the, cities, in, the, distant, past, much, later, at, the, end, of, the, second, dynasty, c, 2890, 2686, bce, pharaoh, seth, peribsen, used, the, set, animal, to, write, his, serekh, name, in, place, of, the, falcon, hieroglyph, representing, horus, his, successor, khasekhemwy, used, both, horus, and, set, in, the, writing, of, his, serekh, this, evidence, has, prompted, conjecture, that, the, second, dynasty, saw, a, clash, between, the, followers, of, the, horus, king, and, the, worshippers, of, set, led, by, seth, peribsen, khasekhemwy, s, use, of, the, two, animal, symbols, would, then, represent, the, reconciliation, of, the, two, factions, as, does, the, resolution, of, the, myth, horus, gradually, took, on, the, nature, as, both, the, son, of, osiris, and, osiris, himself, he, was, referred, to, as, golden, horus, osiris, in, the, temple, of, denderah, he, is, given, the, full, royal, titulary, of, both, that, of, horus, and, osiris, he, was, sometimes, believed, to, be, both, the, father, of, himself, as, well, as, his, own, son, and, some, later, accounts, have, osiris, being, brought, back, to, life, by, isis, heru, ur, or, herwer, and, haroeris, to, the, ptolemaic, greeks, also, known, as, horus, the, elder, was, a, form, of, horus, where, he, was, the, son, of, geb, and, nut, he, was, one, of, the, oldest, gods, of, ancient, egypt, being, worshipped, at, the, influential, predynastic, town, of, nekhen, hierakonpolis, by, the, old, kingdom, he, had, become, the, first, national, god, and, the, patron, of, the, pharaoh, he, was, called, the, son, of, truth, signifying, his, role, as, an, important, upholder, of, maat, his, right, eye, was, the, sun, and, his, left, eye, was, the, moon, heru, ur, was, sometimes, depicted, fully, as, a, falcon, he, was, sometimes, given, the, title, kemwer, meaning, the, great, black, one, other, variants, include, hor, merti, horus, of, the, two, eyes, and, horkhenti, irti, heru, pa, khered, harpocrates, to, the, ptolemaic, greeks, also, known, as, horus, the, younger, is, represented, in, the, form, of, a, youth, wearing, a, lock, of, hair, a, sign, of, youth, on, the, right, of, his, head, while, sucking, his, finger, in, addition, he, usually, wears, the, united, crowns, of, egypt, the, crown, of, upper, egypt, and, the, crown, of, lower, egypt, he, is, a, form, of, the, rising, sun, representing, its, earliest, light, the, winged, sun, of, horus, of, edfu, is, a, symbol, in, associated, with, divinity, royalty, and, power, in, ancient, egypt, the, winged, sun, is, symbolic, also, of, the, eternal, soul, when, placed, above, the, temple, doors, it, served, as, a, reminder, to, the, people, of, their, eternal, nature, the, winged, sun, was, depicted, on, the, top, of, pylons, in, the, ancient, temples, throughout, egypt, her, em, akhet, or, horemakhet, harmakhis, in, greek, represented, the, dawn, and, the, early, morning, sun, he, was, often, depicted, as, a, sphinx, with, the, head, of, a, man, like, the, great, sphinx, of, giza, or, as, a, hieracosphinx, a, creature, with, a, lion, s, body, and, a, falcon, s, head, and, wings, sometimes, with, the, head, of, a, lion, or, ram, the, latter, providing, a, link, to, the, god, khepri, the, rising, sun, it, was, believed, that, he, was, the, inspiration, for, the, great, sphinx, of, giza, constructed, under, the, order, of, khafre, whose, head, it, depicts, other, forms, of, horus, include, the, festival, of, victory, egyptian, heb, nekhtet, was, an, annual, egyptian, festival, dedicated, to, the, god, horus, the, festival, of, victory, was, celebrated, at, the, temple, of, horus, at, edfu, and, took, place, during, the, second, month, of, the, season, of, the, emergence, or, the, sixth, month, of, the, egyptian, calendar, the, ceremonies, which, took, place, during, the, festival, of, victory, included, the, performance, of, a, sacred, drama, which, commemorated, the, victory, of, horus, over, set, the, main, actor, in, this, drama, was, the, king, of, egypt, himself, who, played, the, role, of, horus, his, adversary, was, a, hippopotamus, who, played, the, role, of, set, in, the, course, of, the, ritual, the, king, would, strike, the, hippopotamus, with, a, harpoon, the, destruction, of, the, hippopotamus, by, the, king, commemorated, the, defeat, of, set, by, horus, which, also, legitimised, the, king, it, is, unlikely, that, the, king, attended, the, festival, of, victory, every, year, in, many, cases, he, was, probably, represented, by, a, priest, it, is, also, unlikely, that, a, real, hippopotamus, was, used, in, the, festival, every, year, in, many, cases, it, was, probably, represented, by, a, model, the, 4th, century, roman, author, macrobius, mentions, another, annual, egyptian, festival, dedicated, to, horus, in, his, chronicon, macrobius, specifies, this, festival, as, occurring, on, the, winter, solstice, the, 4th, century, christian, bishop, epiphanius, of, salamis, also, mentions, a, winter, solstice, festival, of, horus, in, his, panarion, however, this, festival, is, not, attested, in, any, native, egyptian, sources, william, r, cooper, s, 1877, book, and, acharya, s, s, self, published, 2008, book, among, others, have, suggested, that, there, are, many, similarities, between, the, story, of, horus, and, the, much, later, story, of, jesus, this, outlook, remains, very, controversial, and, is, disputed, declan, hannigan, portrays, horus, in, the, marvel, cinematic,
