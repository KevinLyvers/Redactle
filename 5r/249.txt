is, legal, in, the, uk, due, to, an, exemption, in, the, law, granted, to, jews, and, muslims, in, addition, to, food, and, diet, a, halal, lifestyle, can, include, travel, finance, clothing, media, recreation, cosmetics, a, halal, lifestyle, can, even, involve, professional, practises, ranging, from, industrial, and, manufacturing, logistics, to, supply, chains, some, muslims, refrain, from, using, pharmaceuticals, that, are, not, halal, this, distinction, is, most, noticeably, practiced, in, malaysia, which, has, a, large, halal, pharmaceutical, industry, complete, with, government, regulations, to, make, sure, the, products, are, tayyib, on, the, other, hand, the, quran, obliges, muslims, to, seek, treatment, including, preventive, ones, for, diseases, regardless, of, what, the, care, provider, believes, in, in, particular, medicines, containing, animal, products, like, gelatin, have, been, deemed, permissible, by, a, 1995, council, of, islamic, jurisprudents, making, such, distinction, unnecessary, the, decentralized, nature, of, islam, allows, both, opinions, to, exist, the, controversy, over, pharmaceuticals, has, led, to, the, refusal, of, childhood, vaccination, in, some, muslim, majority, countries, despite, many, religious, leaders, expressly, endorsing, vaccination, it, is, also, a, concern, in, the, rollout, of, the, covid, 19, vaccine, feminine, hygiene, products, and, diapers, have, been, certified, as, halal, in, malaysia, such, certification, is, not, required, by, the, religion, nor, is, there, a, demand, from, muslims, critics, consider, such, unnecessary, certification, as, little, more, than, a, marketing, gimmick, e, g, halal, labels, on, clearly, vegetarian, soft, drinks, or, naturally, grown, food, items, like, cereals, pulses, vegetables, and, processed, foods, made, exclusively, from, vegetable, products
