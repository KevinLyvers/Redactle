the, designation, renaissance, philosophy, is, used, by, historians, of, philosophy, to, refer, to, the, thought, of, the, period, running, in, europe, roughly, between, 1400, and, 1600, it, therefore, overlaps, both, with, late, medieval, philosophy, which, in, the, fourteenth, and, fifteenth, centuries, was, influenced, by, notable, figures, such, as, albert, the, great, thomas, aquinas, william, of, ockham, and, marsilius, of, padua, and, early, modern, philosophy, which, conventionally, starts, with, ren, descartes, and, his, publication, of, the, discourse, on, method, in, 1637, the, structure, sources, method, and, topics, of, philosophy, in, the, renaissance, had, much, in, common, with, those, of, previous, centuries, particularly, since, the, recovery, of, a, great, portion, of, aristotelian, writings, in, the, twelfth, and, thirteenth, centuries, it, became, clear, that, in, addition, to, aristotle, s, writings, on, logic, which, had, already, been, known, there, were, numerous, others, roughly, having, to, do, with, natural, philosophy, moral, philosophy, and, metaphysics, these, areas, provided, the, structure, for, the, philosophy, curriculum, of, the, emerging, universities, the, general, assumption, was, that, the, most, scientific, branches, of, philosophy, were, those, that, were, more, theoretical, and, therefore, more, widely, applicable, during, the, renaissance, too, many, thinkers, saw, these, as, the, main, philosophical, areas, with, logic, providing, a, training, of, the, mind, to, approach, the, other, three, a, similar, continuity, can, be, seen, in, the, case, of, sources, although, aristotle, was, never, an, unquestioned, authority, he, was, more, often, than, not, a, springboard, for, discussion, and, his, opinions, were, often, discussed, along, those, of, others, or, the, teaching, of, holy, scripture, medieval, lectures, in, physics, consisted, of, reading, aristotle, s, physics, lessons, in, moral, philosophy, consisted, of, examinations, of, his, nicomachean, ethics, and, often, his, politics, and, metaphysics, was, approached, through, his, metaphysics, the, assumption, that, aristotle, s, works, were, foundational, to, an, understanding, of, philosophy, did, not, wane, during, the, renaissance, which, saw, a, flourishing, of, new, translations, commentaries, and, other, interpretations, of, his, works, both, in, latin, and, in, the, vernacular, after, the, reformation, aristotle, s, nicomachean, ethics, continued, to, be, the, main, authority, for, the, discipline, of, ethics, at, protestant, universities, until, the, late, seventeenth, century, with, over, fifty, protestant, commentaries, published, on, the, nicomachean, ethics, before, 1682, in, terms, of, method, philosophy, was, considered, during, the, late, middle, ages, as, a, subject, that, required, robust, enquiry, on, the, part, of, people, trained, in, the, subject, s, technical, vocabulary, philosophical, texts, and, problems, were, typically, approached, through, university, lectures, and, questions, the, latter, similar, in, some, ways, to, modern, debates, examined, the, pros, and, cons, of, particular, philosophical, positions, or, interpretations, they, were, one, of, the, cornerstones, of, the, scholastic, method, made, students, who, proposed, or, responded, to, questions, quick, on, their, feet, and, required, a, deep, familiarity, with, all, of, the, known, philosophical, tradition, which, would, often, be, invoked, in, support, of, or, against, specific, arguments, this, style, of, philosophy, continued, to, have, a, strong, following, in, the, renaissance, pico, della, mirandola, s, disputations, for, instance, depended, directly, on, this, tradition, which, was, not, at, all, limited, to, university, lecture, halls, given, the, remarkable, range, of, aristotelian, philosophy, it, was, possible, to, discuss, all, kinds, of, issues, in, medieval, and, renaissance, philosophy, aristotle, had, treated, directly, problems, such, as, the, trajectory, of, missiles, the, habits, of, animals, how, knowledge, is, acquired, the, freedom, of, the, will, how, virtue, is, connected, with, happiness, the, relationship, of, the, lunar, and, the, sublunar, worlds, indirectly, he, had, stimulated, discussion, on, two, points, that, were, particularly, of, concern, to, christians, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, the, eternity, of, the, world, all, of, these, continued, to, be, of, considerable, interest, to, renaissance, thinkers, but, we, shall, see, that, in, some, cases, the, solutions, offered, were, significantly, different, because, of, changing, cultural, and, religious, landscapes, having, established, that, many, aspects, of, philosophy, were, held, in, common, during, the, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, it, will, now, be, useful, to, discuss, in, what, areas, changes, were, afoot, the, same, outline, as, above, will, be, used, to, show, that, within, trends, of, continuity, one, can, also, find, surprising, differences, it, is, therefore, useful, to, reconsider, what, was, mentioned, above, about, philosophical, sources, the, renaissance, saw, a, significant, broadening, of, source, material, plato, known, directly, only, through, two, and, a, half, dialogues, in, the, middle, ages, came, to, be, known, through, numerous, latin, translations, in, fifteenth, century, italy, culminating, in, the, hugely, influential, translation, of, his, complete, works, by, marsilio, ficino, in, florence, in, 1484, petrarch, was, not, able, to, read, plato, directly, but, he, greatly, admired, him, petrarch, was, also, a, great, admirer, of, roman, poets, such, as, virgil, and, horace, and, of, cicero, for, latin, prose, writing, not, all, renaissance, humanists, followed, his, example, in, all, things, but, petrarch, contributed, to, a, broadening, of, his, time, s, canon, pagan, poetry, had, previously, been, considered, frivolous, and, dangerous, something, that, happened, in, philosophy, as, well, in, the, sixteenth, century, anyone, who, considered, himself, au, fait, read, plato, as, well, as, aristotle, trying, as, much, as, possible, and, not, always, very, successfully, to, reconcile, the, two, with, each, other, and, with, christianity, this, is, probably, the, main, reason, why, donato, acciaiuoli, s, commentary, on, aristotle, s, ethics, first, published, in, 1478, was, so, successful, it, blended, the, three, traditions, beautifully, other, movements, from, ancient, philosophy, also, re, entered, the, mainstream, while, this, was, seldom, the, case, for, epicureanism, which, was, largely, caricatured, and, considered, with, suspicion, pyrrhonism, and, academic, skepticism, made, a, comeback, thanks, to, philosophers, such, as, michel, de, montaigne, and, neostoicism, became, a, popular, movement, due, to, the, writings, of, justus, lipsius, in, all, of, these, cases, it, is, impossible, to, separate, the, pagan, philosophical, doctrines, from, the, christian, filter, through, which, they, were, approached, and, made, legitimate, while, generally, the, aristotelian, structure, of, the, branches, of, philosophy, stayed, in, place, interesting, developments, and, tensions, were, taking, place, within, them, in, moral, philosophy, for, instance, a, position, consistently, held, by, thomas, aquinas, and, his, numerous, followers, was, that, its, three, subfields, ethics, economics, politics, were, related, to, progressively, wider, spheres, the, individual, the, family, and, the, community, politics, thomas, thought, is, more, important, than, ethics, because, it, considers, the, good, of, the, greater, number, this, position, came, under, increasing, strain, in, the, renaissance, as, various, thinkers, claimed, that, thomas, s, classifications, were, inaccurate, and, that, ethics, were, the, most, important, part, of, morality, other, important, figures, such, as, francesco, petrarca, petrarch, 1304, 1374, questioned, the, whole, assumption, that, the, theoretical, aspects, of, philosophy, were, the, more, important, ones, he, insisted, for, instance, on, the, value, of, the, practical, aspects, of, ethics, petrarch, s, position, expressed, both, strongly, and, amusingly, in, his, invective, on, his, own, ignorance, and, that, of, many, others, de, sui, ipsius, ac, multorum, ignorantia, is, also, important, for, another, reason, it, represents, the, conviction, that, philosophy, should, let, itself, be, guided, by, rhetoric, that, the, purpose, of, philosophy, is, therefore, not, so, much, to, reveal, the, truth, but, to, encourage, people, to, pursue, the, good, this, perspective, so, typical, of, italian, humanism, could, easily, lead, to, reducing, all, philosophy, to, ethics, in, a, move, reminiscent, of, plato, s, socrates, and, of, cicero, if, as, mentioned, above, scholasticism, continued, to, flourish, the, italian, humanists, i, e, lovers, and, practitioners, of, the, humanities, challenged, its, supremacy, as, we, have, seen, they, believed, that, philosophy, could, be, brought, under, the, wing, of, rhetoric, they, also, thought, that, the, scholarly, discourse, of, their, time, needed, to, return, to, the, elegance, and, precision, of, its, classical, models, they, therefore, tried, dressing, philosophy, in, a, more, appealing, garb, than, had, their, predecessors, whose, translations, and, commentaries, were, in, technical, latin, and, sometimes, simply, transliterated, the, greek, in, 1416, 1417, leonardo, bruni, the, pre, eminent, humanist, of, his, time, and, chancellor, of, florence, re, translated, aristotle, s, ethics, into, a, more, flowing, idiomatic, and, classical, latin, he, hoped, to, communicate, the, elegance, of, aristotle, s, greek, while, also, making, the, text, more, accessible, to, those, without, a, philosophical, education, others, including, nicol, tignosi, in, florence, around, 1460, and, the, frenchman, jacques, lef, vre, d, taples, in, paris, in, the, 1490s, tried, to, please, the, humanists, either, by, including, in, their, commentaries, on, aristotle, appealing, historical, examples, or, quotations, from, poetry, or, by, avoiding, the, standard, scholastic, format, of, questions, or, both, the, driving, conviction, was, that, philosophy, should, be, freed, of, its, technical, jargon, so, that, more, people, would, be, able, to, read, it, at, the, same, time, all, kinds, of, summaries, paraphrases, and, dialogues, dealing, with, philosophical, issues, were, prepared, in, order, to, give, their, topics, a, wider, dissemination, humanists, also, encouraged, the, study, of, aristotle, and, other, writers, of, antiquity, in, the, original, desiderius, erasmus, the, great, dutch, humanist, even, prepared, a, greek, edition, of, aristotle, and, eventually, those, teaching, philosophy, in, the, universities, had, to, at, least, pretend, that, they, knew, greek, humanists, were, not, however, great, fans, of, the, vernacular, there, is, only, a, handful, of, examples, of, dialogues, or, translations, of, aristotle, s, works, into, italian, during, the, fifteenth, century, once, it, had, been, determined, however, that, italian, was, a, language, with, literary, merit, and, that, it, could, carry, the, weight, of, philosophical, discussion, numerous, efforts, in, this, direction, started, to, appear, particularly, from, the, 1540s, onward, alessandro, piccolomini, had, a, programme, to, translate, or, paraphrase, the, entire, aristotelian, corpus, into, the, vernacular, other, important, figures, were, benedetto, varchi, bernardo, segni, and, giambattista, gelli, all, of, them, active, in, florence, efforts, got, underway, to, present, plato, s, doctrines, in, the, vernacular, as, well, this, rise, of, vernacular, philosophy, which, quite, predated, the, cartesian, approach, is, a, new, field, of, research, whose, contours, are, only, now, beginning, to, be, clarified, it, is, very, hard, to, generalize, about, the, ways, in, which, discussions, of, philosophical, topics, shifted, in, the, renaissance, mainly, because, to, do, so, requires, a, detailed, map, of, the, period, something, we, do, not, yet, have, we, know, that, debates, about, the, freedom, of, the, will, continued, to, flare, up, for, instance, in, the, famous, exchanges, between, erasmus, and, martin, luther, that, spanish, thinkers, were, increasingly, obsessed, with, the, notion, of, nobility, that, duelling, was, a, practice, that, generated, a, large, literature, in, the, sixteenth, century, was, it, permissible, or, not, earlier, histories, gave, perhaps, undue, attention, to, pietro, pomponazzi, s, pronouncements, on, the, immortality, of, the, soul, as, a, question, that, could, not, be, resolved, philosophically, in, a, way, consistent, with, christianity, or, to, pico, della, mirandola, s, oration, on, the, dignity, of, man, as, if, these, were, signals, of, the, period, s, increasing, secularism, or, even, atheism, in, fact, the, most, successful, compendium, of, natural, philosophy, in, the, period, compendium, philosophiae, naturalis, first, published, in, 1530, was, authored, by, frans, titelmans, a, franciscan, friar, from, the, low, countries, whose, work, has, a, very, strong, religious, flavour, we, must, not, forget, that, most, philosophers, of, the, time, were, at, least, nominal, if, not, devout, christians, that, the, sixteenth, century, saw, both, the, protestant, and, the, catholic, reformations, and, that, renaissance, philosophy, culminates, with, the, period, of, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, in, other, words, religion, had, a, massive, importance, in, the, period, and, one, can, hardly, study, philosophy, without, remembering, this, this, is, true, among, others, for, the, philosophy, of, marsilio, ficino, 1433, 1499, who, reinterpreted, plato, in, the, light, of, his, early, greek, commentators, and, also, of, christianity, ficino, hoped, that, a, purified, philosophy, would, bring, about, a, religious, renewal, in, his, society, and, therefore, transformed, distasteful, aspects, of, platonic, philosophy, for, instance, the, homosexual, love, exalted, in, the, symposium, into, spiritual, love, i, e, platonic, love, something, later, transformed, by, pietro, bembo, and, baldassare, castiglione, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, as, something, also, applicable, to, relationships, between, men, and, women, ficino, and, his, followers, also, had, an, interest, in, hidden, knowledge, mainly, because, of, his, belief, that, all, of, ancient, knowledge, was, interconnected, moses, for, instance, had, received, his, insights, from, the, greeks, who, in, turn, had, received, them, from, others, all, according, to, god, s, plan, and, therefore, mutually, consistent, hermeticism, is, relevant, here, although, ficino, s, interest, in, and, practice, of, astrology, was, not, uncommon, in, his, time, one, should, not, necessarily, associate, it, with, philosophy, as, the, two, were, usually, considered, to, be, quite, separate, and, often, in, contradiction, with, each, other, in, conclusion, like, any, other, moment, in, the, history, of, thought, renaissance, philosophy, cannot, be, considered, to, have, provided, something, entirely, new, nor, to, have, continued, for, centuries, to, repeat, the, conclusions, of, its, predecessors, historians, call, this, period, the, renaissance, in, order, to, indicate, the, rebirth, that, took, place, of, ancient, particularly, classical, perspectives, sources, attitudes, toward, literature, and, the, arts, at, the, same, time, we, realize, that, every, re, appropriation, is, constrained, and, even, guided, by, contemporary, concerns, and, biases, it, was, no, different, for, the, period, considered, here, the, old, was, mixed, with, and, changed, by, the, new, but, while, no, claims, can, be, made, for, a, revolutionary, new, starting, point, in, philosophy, in, many, ways, the, synthesis, of, christianity, aristotelianism, and, platonism, offered, by, thomas, aquinas, was, torn, apart, in, order, to, make, way, for, a, new, one, based, on, more, complete, and, varied, sources, often, in, the, original, and, certainly, attuned, to, new, social, and, religious, realities, and, a, much, broader, public
