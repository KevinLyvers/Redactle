in, greek, mythology, achilles, k, l, i, z, kil, eez, or, achilleus, greek, translit, achille, s, was, a, hero, of, the, trojan, war, who, was, known, as, being, the, greatest, of, all, the, greek, warriors, the, central, character, in, homer, s, iliad, he, was, the, son, of, the, nereid, thetis, and, peleus, king, of, phthia, and, famous, argonaut, achilles, was, raised, in, phthia, along, with, his, childhood, companion, patroclus, and, received, his, education, by, the, centaur, chiron, in, the, iliad, he, is, presented, as, the, commander, of, the, mythical, tribe, of, the, myrmidons, achilles, most, notable, feat, during, the, trojan, war, was, the, slaying, of, the, trojan, prince, hector, outside, the, gates, of, troy, although, the, death, of, achilles, is, not, presented, in, the, iliad, other, sources, concur, that, he, was, killed, near, the, end, of, the, trojan, war, by, paris, who, shot, him, with, an, arrow, later, legends, beginning, with, statius, unfinished, epic, achilleid, written, in, the, 1st, century, ad, state, that, achilles, was, invulnerable, in, all, of, his, body, except, for, one, heel, according, to, that, myth, when, his, mother, thetis, dipped, him, in, the, river, styx, as, an, infant, she, held, him, by, one, of, his, heels, leaving, it, untouched, by, the, waters, and, thus, his, only, vulnerable, body, part, alluding, to, these, legends, the, term, achilles, heel, has, come, to, mean, a, point, of, weakness, which, can, lead, to, downfall, especially, in, someone, or, something, with, an, otherwise, strong, constitution, the, achilles, tendon, is, named, after, him, following, the, same, legend, linear, b, tablets, attest, to, the, personal, name, achilleus, in, the, forms, a, ki, re, u, and, a, ki, re, we, the, latter, being, the, dative, of, the, former, the, name, grew, more, popular, becoming, common, soon, after, the, seventh, century, bc, and, was, also, turned, into, the, female, form, achille, a, attested, in, attica, in, the, fourth, century, bc, ig, ii, 1617, and, in, the, form, achillia, on, a, stele, in, halicarnassus, as, the, name, of, a, female, gladiator, fighting, an, amazon, achilles, name, can, be, analyzed, as, a, combination, of, chos, distress, pain, sorrow, grief, and, la, s, people, soldiers, nation, resulting, in, a, proto, form, akh, l, u, os, he, who, has, the, people, distressed, or, he, whose, people, have, distress, the, grief, or, distress, of, the, people, is, a, theme, raised, numerous, times, in, the, iliad, and, frequently, by, achilles, himself, achilles, role, as, the, hero, of, grief, or, distress, forms, an, ironic, juxtaposition, with, the, conventional, view, of, him, as, the, hero, of, kl, os, glory, usually, in, war, furthermore, la, s, has, been, construed, by, gregory, nagy, following, leonard, palmer, to, mean, a, corps, of, soldiers, a, muster, with, this, derivation, the, name, obtains, a, double, meaning, in, the, poem, when, the, hero, is, functioning, rightly, his, men, bring, distress, to, the, enemy, but, when, wrongly, his, men, get, the, grief, of, war, the, poem, is, in, part, about, the, misdirection, of, anger, on, the, part, of, leadership, some, researchers, deem, the, name, a, loan, word, possibly, from, a, pre, greek, language, achilles, descent, from, the, nereid, thetis, and, a, similarity, of, his, name, with, those, of, river, deities, such, as, acheron, and, achelous, have, led, to, speculations, about, his, being, an, old, water, divinity, see, worship, and, heroic, cult, below, robert, s, p, beekes, has, suggested, a, pre, greek, origin, of, the, name, based, among, other, things, on, the, coexistence, of, and, in, epic, language, which, may, account, for, a, palatalized, phoneme, l, y, in, the, original, language, achilles, was, the, son, of, thetis, a, nereid, and, daughter, of, the, old, man, of, the, sea, and, peleus, the, king, of, the, myrmidons, zeus, and, poseidon, had, been, rivals, for, thetis, s, hand, in, marriage, until, prometheus, the, fore, thinker, warned, zeus, of, a, prophecy, originally, uttered, by, themis, goddess, of, divine, law, that, thetis, would, bear, a, son, greater, than, his, father, for, this, reason, the, two, gods, withdrew, their, pursuit, and, had, her, wed, peleus, there, is, a, tale, which, offers, an, alternative, version, of, these, events, in, the, argonautica, 4, 760, zeus, sister, and, wife, hera, alludes, to, thetis, chaste, resistance, to, the, advances, of, zeus, pointing, out, that, thetis, was, so, loyal, to, hera, s, marriage, bond, that, she, coolly, rejected, the, father, of, gods, thetis, although, a, daughter, of, the, sea, god, nereus, was, also, brought, up, by, hera, further, explaining, her, resistance, to, the, advances, of, zeus, zeus, was, furious, and, decreed, that, she, would, never, marry, an, immortal, according, to, the, achilleid, written, by, statius, in, the, 1st, century, ad, and, to, non, surviving, previous, sources, when, achilles, was, born, thetis, tried, to, make, him, immortal, by, dipping, him, in, the, river, styx, however, he, was, left, vulnerable, at, the, part, of, the, body, by, which, she, held, him, his, left, heel, see, achilles, heel, achilles, tendon, it, is, not, clear, if, this, version, of, events, was, known, earlier, in, another, version, of, this, story, thetis, anointed, the, boy, in, ambrosia, and, put, him, on, top, of, a, fire, in, order, to, burn, away, the, mortal, parts, of, his, body, she, was, interrupted, by, peleus, and, abandoned, both, father, and, son, in, a, rage, none, of, the, sources, before, statius, make, any, reference, to, this, general, invulnerability, to, the, contrary, in, the, iliad, homer, mentions, achilles, being, wounded, in, book, 21, the, paeonian, hero, asteropaios, son, of, pelagon, challenged, achilles, by, the, river, scamander, he, was, ambidextrous, and, cast, a, spear, from, each, hand, one, grazed, achilles, elbow, drawing, a, spurt, of, blood, in, the, few, fragmentary, poems, of, the, epic, cycle, which, describe, the, hero, s, death, i, e, the, cypria, the, little, iliad, by, lesches, of, pyrrha, the, aethiopis, and, iliupersis, by, arctinus, of, miletus, there, is, no, trace, of, any, reference, to, his, general, invulnerability, or, his, famous, weakness, at, the, heel, in, the, later, vase, paintings, presenting, the, death, of, achilles, the, arrow, or, in, many, cases, arrows, hit, his, torso, peleus, entrusted, achilles, to, chiron, who, lived, on, mount, pelion, and, was, known, as, the, most, righteous, of, the, centaurs, to, be, reared, in, some, accounts, achilles, original, name, was, ligyron, and, he, was, later, named, achilles, by, his, tutor, chiron, according, to, homer, achilles, grew, up, in, phthia, with, his, childhood, companion, patroclus, homer, further, writes, that, achilles, taught, patroclus, what, he, himself, had, been, taught, by, chiron, including, the, medical, arts, thetis, foretold, that, her, son, s, fate, was, either, to, gain, glory, and, die, young, or, to, live, a, long, but, uneventful, life, in, obscurity, achilles, chose, the, former, and, decided, to, take, part, in, the, trojan, war, according, to, photius, the, sixth, book, of, the, new, history, by, ptolemy, hephaestion, reported, that, thetis, burned, in, a, secret, place, the, children, she, had, by, peleus, when, she, had, achilles, peleus, noticed, tore, him, from, the, flames, with, only, a, burnt, foot, and, confided, him, to, the, centaur, chiron, later, chiron, exhumed, the, body, of, the, damysus, who, was, the, fastest, of, all, the, giants, removed, the, ankle, and, incorporated, it, into, achilles, burnt, foot, in, homer, s, iliad, achilles, is, portrayed, as, tall, and, striking, with, strength, and, looks, that, were, unmatched, among, the, greek, warriors, homer, describes, him, as, having, long, hair, or, a, mane, along, with, other, characters, his, hair, is, described, with, the, word, xanth, which, meant, yellow, or, at, times, shades, thereof, such, as, brown, or, auburn, and, was, used, mostly, for, fair, hair, a, later, latin, account, probably, from, the, 5th, century, ad, falsely, attributed, to, dares, phrygius, described, achilles, as, having, a, large, chest, a, fine, mouth, and, powerfully, formed, arms, and, legs, his, head, was, covered, with, long, wavy, chestnut, colored, hair, though, mild, in, manner, he, was, very, fierce, in, battle, his, face, showed, the, joy, of, a, man, richly, endowed, among, the, appellations, under, which, achilles, is, generally, known, are, the, following, some, post, homeric, sources, claim, that, in, order, to, keep, achilles, safe, from, the, war, thetis, or, in, some, versions, peleus, hid, the, young, man, dressed, as, a, princess, or, at, least, a, girl, at, the, court, of, lycomedes, king, of, skyros, there, achilles, properly, disguised, lived, among, lycomedes, daughters, perhaps, under, the, name, pyrrha, the, red, haired, girl, cercysera, or, aissa, swift, with, lycomedes, daughter, deidamia, with, whom, he, had, begun, a, relationship, achilles, there, fathered, two, sons, neoptolemus, also, called, pyrrhus, after, his, father, s, possible, alias, and, oneiros, according, to, this, story, odysseus, learned, from, the, prophet, calchas, that, the, achaeans, would, be, unable, to, capture, troy, without, achilles, aid, odysseus, went, to, skyros, in, the, guise, of, a, pedlar, selling, women, s, clothes, and, jewellery, and, placed, a, shield, and, spear, among, his, goods, when, achilles, instantly, took, up, the, spear, odysseus, saw, through, his, disguise, and, convinced, him, to, join, the, greek, campaign, in, another, version, of, the, story, odysseus, arranged, for, a, trumpet, alarm, to, be, sounded, while, he, was, with, lycomedes, women, while, the, women, fled, in, panic, achilles, prepared, to, defend, the, court, thus, giving, his, identity, away, according, to, the, iliad, achilles, arrived, at, troy, with, 50, ships, each, carrying, 50, myrmidons, he, appointed, five, leaders, each, leader, commanding, 500, myrmidons, menesthius, eudorus, peisander, phoenix, and, alcimedon, when, the, greeks, left, for, the, trojan, war, they, accidentally, stopped, in, mysia, ruled, by, king, telephus, in, the, resulting, battle, achilles, gave, telephus, a, wound, that, would, not, heal, telephus, consulted, an, oracle, who, stated, that, he, that, wounded, shall, heal, guided, by, the, oracle, he, arrived, at, argos, where, achilles, healed, him, in, order, that, he, might, become, their, guide, for, the, voyage, to, troy, according, to, other, reports, in, euripides, lost, play, about, telephus, he, went, to, aulis, pretending, to, be, a, beggar, and, asked, achilles, to, heal, his, wound, achilles, refused, claiming, to, have, no, medical, knowledge, alternatively, telephus, held, orestes, for, ransom, the, ransom, being, achilles, aid, in, healing, the, wound, odysseus, reasoned, that, the, spear, had, inflicted, the, wound, therefore, the, spear, must, be, able, to, heal, it, pieces, of, the, spear, were, scraped, off, onto, the, wound, and, telephus, was, healed, according, to, the, cypria, the, part, of, the, epic, cycle, that, tells, the, events, of, the, trojan, war, before, achilles, wrath, when, the, achaeans, desired, to, return, home, they, were, restrained, by, achilles, who, afterwards, attacked, the, cattle, of, aeneas, sacked, neighbouring, cities, like, pedasus, and, lyrnessus, where, the, greeks, capture, the, queen, briseis, and, killed, tenes, a, son, of, apollo, as, well, as, priam, s, son, troilus, in, the, sanctuary, of, apollo, thymbraios, however, the, romance, between, troilus, and, chryseis, described, in, geoffrey, chaucer, s, troilus, and, criseyde, and, in, william, shakespeare, s, troilus, and, cressida, is, a, medieval, invention, in, dares, phrygius, account, of, the, destruction, of, troy, the, latin, summary, through, which, the, story, of, achilles, was, transmitted, to, medieval, europe, as, well, as, in, older, accounts, troilus, was, a, young, trojan, prince, the, youngest, of, king, priam, s, and, hecuba, s, five, legitimate, sons, or, according, other, sources, another, son, of, apollo, despite, his, youth, he, was, one, of, the, main, trojan, war, leaders, a, horse, fighter, or, chariot, fighter, according, to, homer, prophecies, linked, troilus, fate, to, that, of, troy, and, so, he, was, ambushed, in, an, attempt, to, capture, him, yet, achilles, struck, by, the, beauty, of, both, troilus, and, his, sister, polyxena, and, overcome, with, lust, directed, his, sexual, attentions, on, the, youth, who, refusing, to, yield, instead, found, himself, decapitated, upon, an, altar, omphalos, of, apollo, thymbraios, later, versions, of, the, story, suggested, troilus, was, accidentally, killed, by, achilles, in, an, over, ardent, lovers, embrace, in, this, version, of, the, myth, achilles, death, therefore, came, in, retribution, for, this, sacrilege, ancient, writers, treated, troilus, as, the, epitome, of, a, dead, child, mourned, by, his, parents, had, troilus, lived, to, adulthood, the, first, vatican, mythographer, claimed, troy, would, have, been, invincible, however, the, motif, is, older, and, found, already, in, plautus, bacchides, homer, s, iliad, is, the, most, famous, narrative, of, achilles, deeds, in, the, trojan, war, achilles, wrath, m, nis, achill, s, is, the, central, theme, of, the, poem, the, first, two, lines, of, the, iliad, read, the, accursed, rage, that, brought, great, suffering, to, the, achaeans, the, homeric, epic, only, covers, a, few, weeks, of, the, decade, long, war, and, does, not, narrate, achilles, death, it, begins, with, achilles, withdrawal, from, battle, after, being, dishonoured, by, agamemnon, the, commander, of, the, achaean, forces, agamemnon, has, taken, a, woman, named, chryseis, as, his, slave, her, father, chryses, a, priest, of, apollo, begs, agamemnon, to, return, her, to, him, agamemnon, refuses, and, apollo, sends, a, plague, amongst, the, greeks, the, prophet, calchas, correctly, determines, the, source, of, the, troubles, but, will, not, speak, unless, achilles, vows, to, protect, him, achilles, does, so, and, calchas, declares, that, chryseis, must, be, returned, to, her, father, agamemnon, consents, but, then, commands, that, achilles, slave, briseis, the, daughter, of, briseus, be, brought, to, him, to, replace, chryseis, angry, at, the, dishonour, of, having, his, plunder, and, glory, taken, away, and, as, he, says, later, because, he, loves, briseis, with, the, urging, of, his, mother, thetis, achilles, refuses, to, fight, or, lead, his, troops, alongside, the, other, greek, forces, at, the, same, time, burning, with, rage, over, agamemnon, s, theft, achilles, prays, to, thetis, to, convince, zeus, to, help, the, trojans, gain, ground, in, the, war, so, that, he, may, regain, his, honour, as, the, battle, turns, against, the, greeks, thanks, to, the, influence, of, zeus, nestor, declares, that, the, trojans, are, winning, because, agamemnon, has, angered, achilles, and, urges, the, king, to, appease, the, warrior, agamemnon, agrees, and, sends, odysseus, and, two, other, chieftains, ajax, and, phoenix, they, promise, that, if, achilles, returns, to, battle, agamemnon, will, return, the, captive, briseis, and, other, gifts, achilles, rejects, all, agamemnon, offers, him, and, simply, urges, the, greeks, to, sail, home, as, he, is, planning, to, do, the, trojans, led, by, hector, subsequently, push, the, greek, army, back, toward, the, beaches, and, assault, the, greek, ships, with, the, greek, forces, on, the, verge, of, absolute, destruction, patroclus, leads, the, myrmidons, into, battle, wearing, achilles, armour, though, achilles, remains, at, his, camp, patroclus, succeeds, in, pushing, the, trojans, back, from, the, beaches, but, is, killed, by, hector, before, he, can, lead, a, proper, assault, on, the, city, of, troy, after, receiving, the, news, of, the, death, of, patroclus, from, antilochus, the, son, of, nestor, achilles, grieves, over, his, beloved, companion, s, death, his, mother, thetis, comes, to, comfort, the, distraught, achilles, she, persuades, hephaestus, to, make, new, armour, for, him, in, place, of, the, armour, that, patroclus, had, been, wearing, which, was, taken, by, hector, the, new, armour, includes, the, shield, of, achilles, described, in, great, detail, in, the, poem, enraged, over, the, death, of, patroclus, achilles, ends, his, refusal, to, fight, and, takes, the, field, killing, many, men, in, his, rage, but, always, seeking, out, hector, achilles, even, engages, in, battle, with, the, river, god, scamander, who, has, become, angry, that, achilles, is, choking, his, waters, with, all, the, men, he, has, killed, the, god, tries, to, drown, achilles, but, is, stopped, by, hera, and, hephaestus, zeus, himself, takes, note, of, achilles, rage, and, sends, the, gods, to, restrain, him, so, that, he, will, not, go, on, to, sack, troy, itself, before, the, time, allotted, for, its, destruction, seeming, to, show, that, the, unhindered, rage, of, achilles, can, defy, fate, itself, finally, achilles, finds, his, prey, achilles, chases, hector, around, the, wall, of, troy, three, times, before, athena, in, the, form, of, hector, s, favorite, and, dearest, brother, deiphobus, persuades, hector, to, stop, running, and, fight, achilles, face, to, face, after, hector, realizes, the, trick, he, knows, the, battle, is, inevitable, wanting, to, go, down, fighting, he, charges, at, achilles, with, his, only, weapon, his, sword, but, misses, accepting, his, fate, hector, begs, achilles, not, to, spare, his, life, but, to, treat, his, body, with, respect, after, killing, him, achilles, tells, hector, it, is, hopeless, to, expect, that, of, him, declaring, that, my, rage, my, fury, would, drive, me, now, to, hack, your, flesh, away, and, eat, you, raw, such, agonies, you, have, caused, me, achilles, then, kills, hector, and, drags, his, corpse, by, its, heels, behind, his, chariot, after, having, a, dream, where, patroclus, begs, achilles, to, hold, his, funeral, achilles, hosts, a, series, of, funeral, games, in, honour, of, his, companion, at, the, onset, of, his, duel, with, hector, achilles, is, referred, to, as, the, brightest, star, in, the, sky, which, comes, on, in, the, autumn, orion, s, dog, sirius, a, sign, of, evil, during, the, cremation, of, patroclus, he, is, compared, to, hesperus, the, evening, western, star, venus, while, the, burning, of, the, funeral, pyre, lasts, until, phosphorus, the, morning, eastern, star, also, venus, has, set, descended, with, the, assistance, of, the, god, hermes, argeiphontes, hector, s, father, priam, goes, to, achilles, tent, to, plead, with, achilles, for, the, return, of, hector, s, body, so, that, he, can, be, buried, achilles, relents, and, promises, a, truce, for, the, duration, of, the, funeral, lasting, 9, days, with, a, burial, on, the, 10th, in, the, tradition, of, niobe, s, offspring, the, poem, ends, with, a, description, of, hector, s, funeral, with, the, doom, of, troy, and, achilles, himself, still, to, come, the, aethiopis, 7th, century, bc, and, a, work, named, posthomerica, composed, by, quintus, of, smyrna, in, the, fourth, century, ce, relate, further, events, from, the, trojan, war, when, penthesilea, queen, of, the, amazons, and, daughter, of, ares, arrives, in, troy, priam, hopes, that, she, will, defeat, achilles, after, his, temporary, truce, with, priam, achilles, fights, and, kills, the, warrior, queen, only, to, grieve, over, her, death, later, initially, taken, aback, he, did, not, fight, as, intensely, as, usual, once, he, realized, that, his, distraction, was, endangering, his, life, he, refocused, and, killed, her, following, the, death, of, patroclus, nestor, s, son, antilochus, becomes, achilles, closest, companion, when, memnon, son, of, the, dawn, goddess, eos, and, king, of, ethiopia, slays, antilochus, achilles, once, more, obtains, revenge, on, the, battlefield, killing, memnon, consequently, eos, will, not, let, the, sun, rise, until, zeus, persuades, her, the, fight, between, achilles, and, memnon, over, antilochus, echoes, that, of, achilles, and, hector, over, patroclus, except, that, memnon, unlike, hector, was, also, the, son, of, a, goddess, many, homeric, scholars, argued, that, episode, inspired, many, details, in, the, iliad, s, description, of, the, death, of, patroclus, and, achilles, reaction, to, it, the, episode, then, formed, the, basis, of, the, cyclic, epic, aethiopis, which, was, composed, after, the, iliad, possibly, in, the, 7th, century, bc, the, aethiopis, is, now, lost, except, for, scattered, fragments, quoted, by, later, authors, the, exact, nature, of, achilles, relationship, with, patroclus, has, been, a, subject, of, dispute, in, both, the, classical, period, and, modern, times, in, the, iliad, it, appears, to, be, the, model, of, a, deep, and, loyal, friendship, homer, does, not, suggest, that, achilles, and, his, close, friend, patroclus, had, sexual, relations, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, in, the, text, of, the, iliad, that, achilles, and, patroclus, were, lovers, this, theory, was, expressed, by, some, later, authors, commentators, from, classical, antiquity, to, the, present, have, often, interpreted, the, relationship, through, the, lens, of, their, own, cultures, in, 5th, century, bc, athens, the, intense, bond, was, often, viewed, in, light, of, the, greek, custom, of, paiderasteia, which, is, the, relationship, between, an, older, male, and, a, younger, one, usually, a, teenager, in, patroclus, and, achilles, case, achilles, would, have, been, the, younger, as, patroclus, is, usually, seen, as, his, elder, in, plato, s, symposium, the, participants, in, a, dialogue, about, love, assume, that, achilles, and, patroclus, were, a, couple, phaedrus, argues, that, achilles, was, the, younger, and, more, beautiful, one, so, he, was, the, beloved, and, patroclus, was, the, lover, however, ancient, greek, had, no, words, to, distinguish, heterosexual, and, homosexual, and, it, was, assumed, that, a, man, could, both, desire, handsome, young, men, and, have, sex, with, women, many, pairs, of, men, throughout, history, have, been, compared, to, achilles, and, patroclus, to, imply, a, homosexual, relationship, the, death, of, achilles, even, if, considered, solely, as, it, occurred, in, the, oldest, sources, is, a, complex, one, with, many, different, versions, starting, with, the, oldest, account, in, book, 22, of, the, iliad, hector, predicts, with, his, last, dying, breath, that, paris, and, apollo, will, slay, him, at, the, scaean, gates, leading, to, troy, with, an, arrow, to, the, heel, according, to, statius, in, book, 23, the, sad, spirit, of, dead, patroclus, visits, achilles, just, as, he, drifts, off, into, slumber, requesting, that, his, bones, be, placed, with, those, of, achilles, in, his, golden, vase, a, gift, of, his, mother, in, book, 11, of, the, odyssey, odysseus, sails, to, the, underworld, and, converses, with, the, shades, one, of, these, is, achilles, who, when, greeted, as, blessed, in, life, blessed, in, death, responds, that, he, would, rather, be, a, slave, to, the, worst, of, masters, than, be, king, of, all, the, dead, but, achilles, then, asks, odysseus, of, his, son, s, exploits, in, the, trojan, war, and, odysseus, tells, him, of, neoptolemus, actions, book, 24, of, odyssey, gives, dead, king, agamemnon, s, ghostly, account, of, achilles, death, the, bleached, bones, from, achilles, funeral, pyre, had, been, mixed, with, those, of, patroclus, and, put, into, his, mother, s, golden, vase, also, the, bones, of, antilochus, who, had, become, closer, to, achilles, than, any, other, following, patroclus, death, were, separately, enclosed, the, customary, funeral, games, of, a, hero, were, performed, and, a, massive, tomb, or, mound, was, built, on, the, hellespont, for, approaching, seagoers, to, celebrate, achilles, was, represented, in, the, aethiopis, as, living, after, his, death, in, the, island, of, leuke, at, the, mouth, of, the, river, danube, another, version, of, achilles, death, is, that, he, fell, deeply, in, love, with, one, of, the, trojan, princesses, polyxena, achilles, asks, priam, for, polyxena, s, hand, in, marriage, priam, is, willing, because, it, would, mean, the, end, of, the, war, and, an, alliance, with, the, world, s, greatest, warrior, but, while, priam, is, overseeing, the, private, marriage, of, polyxena, and, achilles, paris, who, would, have, to, give, up, helen, if, achilles, married, his, sister, hides, in, the, bushes, and, shoots, achilles, with, a, divine, arrow, killing, him, according, to, some, accounts, he, had, married, medea, in, life, so, that, after, both, their, deaths, they, were, united, in, the, elysian, fields, of, hades, as, hera, promised, thetis, in, apollonius, argonautica, 3rd, century, bc, achilles, armour, was, the, object, of, a, feud, between, odysseus, and, telamonian, ajax, ajax, the, greater, they, competed, for, it, by, giving, speeches, on, why, they, were, the, bravest, after, achilles, to, their, trojan, prisoners, who, after, considering, both, men, s, presentations, decided, odysseus, was, more, deserving, of, the, armour, furious, ajax, cursed, odysseus, which, earned, him, the, ire, of, athena, who, temporarily, made, ajax, so, mad, with, grief, and, anguish, that, he, began, killing, sheep, thinking, them, his, comrades, after, a, while, when, athena, lifted, his, madness, and, ajax, realized, that, he, had, actually, been, killing, sheep, he, was, so, ashamed, that, he, committed, suicide, odysseus, eventually, gave, the, armour, to, neoptolemus, the, son, of, achilles, when, odysseus, encounters, the, shade, of, ajax, much, later, in, the, house, of, hades, odyssey, 11, 543, 566, ajax, is, still, so, angry, about, the, outcome, of, the, competition, that, he, refuses, to, speak, to, odysseus, the, armour, they, fought, for, was, made, by, hephaestus, and, thus, much, stronger, and, more, beautiful, than, any, armour, a, mortal, could, craft, thetis, had, the, gear, made, for, achilles, because, his, first, set, was, worn, by, patroclus, when, he, went, to, battle, and, taken, by, hector, when, he, killed, patroclus, the, shield, of, achilles, was, also, made, by, the, fire, god, his, legendary, spear, was, given, to, him, by, his, mentor, chiron, before, he, participated, in, the, trojan, war, it, was, called, the, pelian, spear, which, allegedly, no, other, man, could, wield, a, relic, claimed, to, be, achilles, bronze, headed, spear, was, preserved, for, centuries, in, the, temple, of, athena, on, the, acropolis, of, phaselis, lycia, a, port, on, the, pamphylian, gulf, the, city, was, visited, in, 333, bc, by, alexander, the, great, who, envisioned, himself, as, the, new, achilles, and, carried, the, iliad, with, him, but, his, court, biographers, do, not, mention, the, spear, however, it, was, shown, in, the, time, of, pausanias, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, numerous, paintings, on, pottery, have, suggested, a, tale, not, mentioned, in, the, literary, traditions, at, some, point, in, the, war, achilles, and, ajax, were, playing, a, board, game, petteia, they, were, absorbed, in, the, game, and, oblivious, to, the, surrounding, battle, the, trojans, attacked, and, reached, the, heroes, who, were, saved, only, by, an, intervention, of, athena, the, tomb, of, achilles, extant, throughout, antiquity, in, troad, was, venerated, by, thessalians, but, also, by, persian, expeditionary, forces, as, well, as, by, alexander, the, great, and, the, roman, emperor, caracalla, achilles, cult, was, also, to, be, found, at, other, places, e, g, on, the, island, of, astypalaea, in, the, sporades, in, sparta, which, had, a, sanctuary, in, elis, and, in, achilles, homeland, thessaly, as, well, as, in, the, magna, graecia, cities, of, tarentum, locri, and, croton, accounting, for, an, almost, panhellenic, cult, to, the, hero, the, cult, of, achilles, is, illustrated, in, the, 500, bc, polyxena, sarcophagus, which, depicts, the, sacrifice, of, polyxena, near, the, tumulus, of, achilles, strabo, 13, 1, 32, also, suggested, that, such, a, cult, of, achilles, existed, in, troad, near, the, sigeium, is, a, temple, and, monument, of, achilles, and, monuments, also, of, patroclus, and, anthlochus, the, ilienses, perform, sacred, ceremonies, in, honour, of, them, all, and, even, of, ajax, but, they, do, not, worship, hercules, alleging, as, a, reason, that, he, ravaged, their, country, the, spread, and, intensity, of, the, hero, s, veneration, among, the, greeks, that, had, settled, on, the, northern, coast, of, the, pontus, euxinus, today, s, black, sea, appears, to, have, been, remarkable, an, archaic, cult, is, attested, for, the, milesian, colony, of, olbia, as, well, as, for, an, island, in, the, middle, of, the, black, sea, today, identified, with, snake, island, ukrainian, zmiinyi, near, kiliya, ukraine, early, dedicatory, inscriptions, from, the, greek, colonies, on, the, black, sea, graffiti, and, inscribed, clay, disks, these, possibly, being, votive, offerings, from, olbia, the, area, of, berezan, island, and, the, tauric, chersonese, attest, the, existence, of, a, heroic, cult, of, achilles, from, the, sixth, century, bc, onwards, the, cult, was, still, thriving, in, the, third, century, ce, when, dedicatory, stelae, from, olbia, refer, to, an, achilles, pont, rch, s, roughly, lord, of, the, sea, or, of, the, pontus, euxinus, who, was, invoked, as, a, protector, of, the, city, of, olbia, venerated, on, par, with, olympian, gods, such, as, the, local, apollo, prostates, hermes, agoraeus, or, poseidon, pliny, the, elder, 23, 79, ad, in, his, natural, history, mentions, a, port, of, the, ach, i, and, an, island, of, achilles, famous, for, the, tomb, of, that, man, portus, achaeorum, insula, achillis, tumulo, eius, viri, clara, situated, somewhat, nearby, olbia, and, the, dnieper, bug, estuary, furthermore, at, 125, roman, miles, from, this, island, he, places, a, peninsula, which, stretches, forth, in, the, shape, of, a, sword, obliquely, called, dromos, achilleos, achill, s, dr, mos, the, race, course, of, achilles, and, considered, the, place, of, the, hero, s, exercise, or, of, games, instituted, by, him, this, last, feature, of, pliny, s, account, is, considered, to, be, the, iconic, spit, called, today, tendra, or, kosa, tendra, and, kosa, djarilgatch, situated, between, the, mouth, of, the, dnieper, and, karkinit, bay, but, which, is, hardly, 125, roman, miles, c, 185, km, away, from, the, dnieper, bug, estuary, as, pliny, states, to, the, race, course, he, gives, a, length, of, 80, miles, c, 120, km, whereas, the, spit, measures, c, 70, km, today, in, the, following, chapter, of, his, book, pliny, refers, to, the, same, island, as, achillea, and, introduces, two, further, names, for, it, leuce, or, macaron, from, greek, island, of, the, blest, the, present, day, measures, he, gives, at, this, point, seem, to, account, for, an, identification, of, achillea, or, leuce, with, today, s, snake, island, pliny, s, contemporary, pomponius, mela, c, 43, ad, tells, that, achilles, was, buried, on, an, island, named, achillea, situated, between, the, borysthenes, and, the, ister, adding, to, the, geographical, confusion, ruins, of, a, square, temple, measuring, 30, meters, to, a, side, possibly, that, dedicated, to, achilles, were, discovered, by, captain, kritzikly, russian, in, 1823, on, snake, island, a, second, exploration, in, 1840, showed, that, the, construction, of, a, lighthouse, had, destroyed, all, traces, of, this, temple, a, fifth, century, bc, black, glazed, lekythos, inscription, found, on, the, island, in, 1840, reads, glaukos, son, of, poseidon, dedicated, me, to, achilles, lord, of, leuke, in, another, inscription, from, the, fifth, or, fourth, century, bc, a, statue, is, dedicated, to, achilles, lord, of, leuke, by, a, citizen, of, olbia, while, in, a, further, dedication, the, city, of, olbia, confirms, its, continuous, maintenance, of, the, island, s, cult, again, suggesting, its, quality, as, a, place, of, a, supra, regional, hero, veneration, the, heroic, cult, dedicated, to, achilles, on, leuce, seems, to, go, back, to, an, account, from, the, lost, epic, aethiopis, according, to, which, after, his, untimely, death, thetis, had, snatched, her, son, from, the, funeral, pyre, and, removed, him, to, a, mythical, le, k, n, sos, white, island, already, in, the, fifth, century, bc, pindar, had, mentioned, a, cult, of, achilles, on, a, bright, island, phaenn, n, sos, of, the, black, sea, while, in, another, of, his, works, pindar, would, retell, the, story, of, the, immortalized, achilles, living, on, a, geographically, indefinite, island, of, the, blest, together, with, other, heroes, such, as, his, father, peleus, and, cadmus, well, known, is, the, connection, of, these, mythological, fortunate, isles, mak, r, n, n, soi, or, the, homeric, elysium, with, the, stream, oceanus, which, according, to, greek, mythology, surrounds, the, inhabited, world, which, should, have, accounted, for, the, identification, of, the, northern, strands, of, the, euxine, with, it, guy, hedreen, has, found, further, evidence, for, this, connection, of, achilles, with, the, northern, margin, of, the, inhabited, world, in, a, poem, by, alcaeus, speaking, of, achilles, lord, of, scythia, and, the, opposition, of, north, and, south, as, evoked, by, achilles, fight, against, the, aethiopian, prince, memnon, who, in, his, turn, would, be, removed, to, his, homeland, by, his, mother, eos, after, his, death, the, periplus, of, the, euxine, sea, c, 130, ad, gives, the, following, details, it, is, said, that, the, goddess, thetis, raised, this, island, from, the, sea, for, her, son, achilles, who, dwells, there, here, is, his, temple, and, his, statue, an, archaic, work, this, island, is, not, inhabited, and, goats, graze, on, it, not, many, which, the, people, who, happen, to, arrive, here, with, their, ships, sacrifice, to, achilles, in, this, temple, are, also, deposited, a, great, many, holy, gifts, craters, rings, and, precious, stones, offered, to, achilles, in, gratitude, one, can, still, read, inscriptions, in, greek, and, latin, in, which, achilles, is, praised, and, celebrated, some, of, these, are, worded, in, patroclus, honour, because, those, who, wish, to, be, favored, by, achilles, honour, patroclus, at, the, same, time, there, are, also, in, this, island, countless, numbers, of, sea, birds, which, look, after, achilles, temple, every, morning, they, fly, out, to, sea, wet, their, wings, with, water, and, return, quickly, to, the, temple, and, sprinkle, it, and, after, they, finish, the, sprinkling, they, clean, the, hearth, of, the, temple, with, their, wings, other, people, say, still, more, that, some, of, the, men, who, reach, this, island, come, here, intentionally, they, bring, animals, in, their, ships, destined, to, be, sacrificed, some, of, these, animals, they, slaughter, others, they, set, free, on, the, island, in, achilles, honour, but, there, are, others, who, are, forced, to, come, to, this, island, by, sea, storms, as, they, have, no, sacrificial, animals, but, wish, to, get, them, from, the, god, of, the, island, himself, they, consult, achilles, oracle, they, ask, permission, to, slaughter, the, victims, chosen, from, among, the, animals, that, graze, freely, on, the, island, and, to, deposit, in, exchange, the, price, which, they, consider, fair, but, in, case, the, oracle, denies, them, permission, because, there, is, an, oracle, here, they, add, something, to, the, price, offered, and, if, the, oracle, refuses, again, they, add, something, more, until, at, last, the, oracle, agrees, that, the, price, is, sufficient, and, then, the, victim, doesn, t, run, away, any, more, but, waits, willingly, to, be, caught, so, there, is, a, great, quantity, of, silver, there, consecrated, to, the, hero, as, price, for, the, sacrificial, victims, to, some, of, the, people, who, come, to, this, island, achilles, appears, in, dreams, to, others, he, would, appear, even, during, their, navigation, if, they, were, not, too, far, away, and, would, instruct, them, as, to, which, part, of, the, island, they, would, better, anchor, their, ships, the, greek, geographer, dionysius, periegetes, who, likely, lived, during, the, first, century, ce, wrote, that, the, island, was, called, leuce, because, the, wild, animals, which, live, there, are, white, it, is, said, that, there, in, leuce, island, reside, the, souls, of, achilles, and, other, heroes, and, that, they, wander, through, the, uninhabited, valleys, of, this, island, this, is, how, jove, rewarded, the, men, who, had, distinguished, themselves, through, their, virtues, because, through, virtue, they, had, acquired, everlasting, honour, similarly, others, relate, the, island, s, name, to, its, white, cliffs, snakes, or, birds, dwelling, there, pausanias, has, been, told, that, the, island, is, covered, with, forests, and, full, of, animals, some, wild, some, tame, in, this, island, there, is, also, achilles, temple, and, his, statue, leuce, had, also, a, reputation, as, a, place, of, healing, pausanias, reports, that, the, delphic, pythia, sent, a, lord, of, croton, to, be, cured, of, a, chest, wound, ammianus, marcellinus, attributes, the, healing, to, waters, aquae, on, the, island, strabo, mentioned, that, the, cape, of, the, racecourse, of, achilles, was, sacred, to, achilles, and, although, it, was, treeless, was, called, alsos, alsos, in, greek, means, grove, a, number, of, important, commercial, port, cities, of, the, greek, waters, were, dedicated, to, achilles, herodotus, pliny, the, elder, and, strabo, reported, on, the, existence, of, a, town, ach, lleion, built, by, settlers, from, mytilene, in, the, sixth, century, bc, close, to, the, hero, s, presumed, burial, mound, in, the, troad, later, attestations, point, to, an, ach, lleion, in, messenia, according, to, stephanus, byzantinus, and, an, ach, lleios, in, laconia, nicolae, densu, ianu, recognized, a, connection, to, achilles, in, the, names, of, aquileia, and, of, the, northern, arm, of, the, danube, delta, called, chilia, presumably, from, an, older, achileii, though, his, conclusion, that, leuce, had, sovereign, rights, over, the, black, sea, evokes, modern, rather, than, archaic, sea, law, the, kings, of, epirus, claimed, to, be, descended, from, achilles, through, his, son, neoptolemus, alexander, the, great, son, of, the, epirote, princess, olympias, could, therefore, also, claim, this, descent, and, in, many, ways, strove, to, be, like, his, great, ancestor, he, is, said, to, have, visited, the, tomb, of, achilles, at, achilleion, while, passing, troy, in, ad, 216, the, roman, emperor, caracalla, while, on, his, way, to, war, against, parthia, emulated, alexander, by, holding, games, around, achilles, tumulus, the, greek, tragedian, aeschylus, wrote, a, trilogy, of, plays, about, achilles, given, the, title, achilleis, by, modern, scholars, the, tragedies, relate, the, deeds, of, achilles, during, the, trojan, war, including, his, defeat, of, hector, and, eventual, death, when, an, arrow, shot, by, paris, and, guided, by, apollo, punctures, his, heel, extant, fragments, of, the, achilleis, and, other, aeschylean, fragments, have, been, assembled, to, produce, a, workable, modern, play, the, first, part, of, the, achilleis, trilogy, the, myrmidons, focused, on, the, relationship, between, achilles, and, chorus, who, represent, the, achaean, army, and, try, to, convince, achilles, to, give, up, his, quarrel, with, agamemnon, only, a, few, lines, survive, today, in, plato, s, symposium, phaedrus, points, out, that, aeschylus, portrayed, achilles, as, the, lover, and, patroclus, as, the, beloved, phaedrus, argues, that, this, is, incorrect, because, achilles, being, the, younger, and, more, beautiful, of, the, two, was, the, beloved, who, loved, his, lover, so, much, that, he, chose, to, die, to, avenge, him, the, tragedian, sophocles, also, wrote, the, lovers, of, achilles, a, play, with, achilles, as, the, main, character, only, a, few, fragments, survive, towards, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, bc, a, more, negative, view, of, achilles, emerges, in, greek, drama, euripides, refers, to, achilles, in, a, bitter, or, ironic, tone, in, hecuba, electra, and, iphigenia, in, aulis, other, contemporary, tragedians, such, as, astydamas, wrote, works, on, achilles, that, are, completely, lost, today, the, philosopher, zeno, of, elea, centred, one, of, his, paradoxes, on, an, imaginary, footrace, between, swift, footed, achilles, and, a, tortoise, by, which, he, attempted, to, show, that, achilles, could, not, catch, up, to, a, tortoise, with, a, head, start, and, therefore, that, motion, and, change, were, impossible, as, a, student, of, the, monist, parmenides, and, a, member, of, the, eleatic, school, zeno, believed, time, and, motion, to, be, illusions, in, hippias, minor, a, socratic, dialogue, attributed, to, plato, an, arrogant, man, named, hippias, argues, with, socrates, the, two, get, into, a, discussion, about, lying, they, decide, that, a, person, who, is, intentionally, false, must, be, better, than, a, person, who, is, unintentionally, false, on, the, basis, that, someone, who, lies, intentionally, must, understand, the, subject, about, which, they, are, lying, socrates, uses, various, analogies, discussing, athletics, and, the, sciences, to, prove, his, point, the, two, also, reference, homer, extensively, socrates, and, hippias, agree, that, odysseus, who, concocted, a, number, of, lies, throughout, the, odyssey, and, other, stories, in, the, trojan, war, cycle, was, false, intentionally, achilles, like, odysseus, told, numerous, falsehoods, hippias, believes, that, achilles, was, a, generally, honest, man, while, socrates, believes, that, achilles, lied, for, his, own, benefit, the, two, argue, over, whether, it, is, better, to, lie, on, purpose, or, by, accident, socrates, eventually, abandons, homeric, arguments, and, makes, sports, analogies, to, drive, home, the, point, someone, who, does, wrong, on, purpose, is, a, better, person, than, someone, who, does, wrong, unintentionally, the, romans, who, traditionally, traced, their, lineage, to, troy, took, a, highly, negative, view, of, achilles, virgil, refers, to, achilles, as, a, savage, and, a, merciless, butcher, of, men, while, horace, portrays, achilles, ruthlessly, slaying, women, and, children, other, writers, such, as, catullus, propertius, and, ovid, represent, a, second, strand, of, disparagement, with, an, emphasis, on, achilles, erotic, career, this, strand, continues, in, latin, accounts, of, the, trojan, war, by, writers, such, as, dictys, cretensis, and, dares, phrygius, and, in, beno, t, de, sainte, maure, s, roman, de, troie, and, guido, delle, colonne, s, historia, destructionis, troiae, which, remained, the, most, widely, read, and, retold, versions, of, the, matter, of, troy, until, the, 17th, century, achilles, was, described, by, the, byzantine, chronicler, leo, the, deacon, not, as, hellene, but, as, scythian, while, according, to, the, byzantine, author, john, malalas, his, army, was, made, up, of, a, tribe, previously, known, as, myrmidons, and, later, as, bulgars, achilles, has, been, frequently, the, subject, of, operas, ballets, and, related, genres, achilles, has, been, portrayed, in, the, following, films, and, television, series
