shamanism, or, samanism, is, a, religious, practice, that, involves, a, practitioner, shaman, or, saman, interacting, with, the, spirit, world, through, altered, states, of, consciousness, such, as, trance, the, goal, of, this, is, usually, to, direct, spirits, or, spiritual, energies, into, the, physical, world, for, the, purpose, of, healing, divination, or, to, aid, human, beings, in, some, other, way, beliefs, and, practices, categorized, as, shamanic, have, attracted, the, interest, of, scholars, from, a, variety, of, disciplines, including, anthropologists, archeologists, historians, religious, studies, scholars, philosophers, and, psychologists, hundreds, of, books, and, academic, papers, on, the, subject, have, been, produced, with, a, peer, reviewed, academic, journal, being, devoted, to, the, study, of, shamanism, in, the, 20th, century, non, indigenous, westerners, involved, in, countercultural, movements, such, as, hippies, and, the, new, age, created, modern, magico, religious, practices, influenced, by, their, ideas, of, various, indigenous, religions, creating, what, has, been, termed, neoshamanism, or, the, neoshamanic, movement, it, has, affected, the, development, of, many, neopagan, practices, as, well, as, faced, a, backlash, and, accusations, of, cultural, appropriation, exploitation, and, misrepresentation, when, outside, observers, have, tried, to, practice, the, ceremonies, of, or, represent, centuries, old, cultures, to, which, they, do, not, belong, the, modern, english, word, shamanism, derives, from, the, russian, word, am, n, which, itself, comes, from, the, word, sam, n, from, a, tungusic, language, possibly, from, the, southwestern, dialect, of, the, evenki, spoken, by, the, sym, evenki, peoples, or, from, the, manchu, language, the, etymology, of, the, word, is, sometimes, connected, to, the, tungus, root, s, meaning, to, know, however, finnish, ethnolinguist, juha, janhunen, questions, this, connection, on, linguistic, grounds, the, possibility, cannot, be, completely, rejected, but, neither, should, it, be, accepted, without, reservation, since, the, assumed, derivational, relationship, is, phonologically, irregular, note, especially, the, vowel, quantities, mircea, eliade, noted, that, the, sanskrit, word, rama, a, designating, a, wandering, monastic, or, holy, figure, has, spread, to, many, central, asian, languages, along, with, buddhism, and, could, be, the, ultimate, origin, of, the, word, shaman, the, word, has, been, reported, in, gandhari, as, amana, in, tocharian, a, as, ma, in, tocharian, b, as, am, ne, and, in, chinese, as, sh, m, n, the, term, was, adopted, by, russians, interacting, with, the, indigenous, peoples, in, siberia, it, is, found, in, the, memoirs, of, the, exiled, russian, churchman, avvakum, it, was, brought, to, western, europe, twenty, years, later, by, the, dutch, traveler, nicolaes, witsen, who, reported, his, stay, and, journeys, among, the, tungusic, and, samoyedic, speaking, indigenous, peoples, of, siberia, in, his, book, noord, en, oost, tataryen, 1692, adam, brand, a, merchant, from, l, beck, published, in, 1698, his, account, of, a, russian, embassy, to, china, a, translation, of, his, book, published, the, same, year, introduced, the, word, shaman, to, english, speakers, anthropologist, and, archeologist, silvia, tomaskova, argued, that, by, the, mid, 1600s, many, europeans, applied, the, arabic, term, shaitan, meaning, devil, to, the, non, christian, practices, and, beliefs, of, indigenous, peoples, beyond, the, ural, mountains, she, suggests, that, shaman, may, have, entered, the, various, tungus, dialects, as, a, corruption, of, this, term, and, then, been, told, to, christian, missionaries, explorers, soldiers, and, colonial, administrators, with, whom, the, people, had, increasing, contact, for, centuries, a, female, shaman, is, sometimes, called, a, shamanka, which, is, not, an, actual, tungus, term, but, simply, shaman, plus, the, russian, suffix, ka, for, feminine, nouns, there, is, no, single, agreed, upon, definition, for, the, word, shamanism, among, anthropologists, thomas, downson, suggests, three, shared, elements, of, shamanism, practitioners, consistently, alter, consciousness, the, community, regards, altering, consciousness, as, an, important, ritual, practice, and, the, knowledge, about, the, practice, is, controlled, the, english, historian, ronald, hutton, noted, that, by, the, dawn, of, the, 21st, century, there, were, four, separate, definitions, of, the, term, which, appeared, to, be, in, use, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, a, shaman, m, n, shah, men, m, n, or, e, m, n, is, someone, who, is, regarded, as, having, access, to, and, influence, in, the, world, of, benevolent, and, malevolent, spirits, who, typically, enters, into, a, trance, state, during, a, ritual, and, practices, divination, and, healing, the, word, shaman, probably, originates, from, the, tungusic, evenki, language, of, north, asia, according, to, juha, janhunen, the, word, is, attested, in, all, of, the, tungusic, idioms, such, as, negidal, lamut, udehe, orochi, nanai, ilcha, orok, manchu, and, ulcha, and, nothing, seems, to, contradict, the, assumption, that, the, meaning, shaman, also, derives, from, proto, tungusic, and, may, have, roots, that, extend, back, in, time, at, least, two, millennia, the, term, was, introduced, to, the, west, after, russian, forces, conquered, the, shamanistic, khanate, of, kazan, in, 1552, the, term, shamanism, was, first, applied, by, western, anthropologists, as, outside, observers, of, the, ancient, religion, of, the, turks, and, mongols, as, well, as, those, of, the, neighbouring, tungusic, and, samoyedic, speaking, peoples, upon, observing, more, religious, traditions, around, the, world, some, western, anthropologists, began, to, also, use, the, term, in, a, very, broad, sense, the, term, was, used, to, describe, unrelated, magicoreligious, practices, found, within, the, ethnic, religions, of, other, parts, of, asia, africa, australasia, and, even, completely, unrelated, parts, of, the, americas, as, they, believed, these, practices, to, be, similar, to, one, another, while, the, term, has, been, incorrectly, applied, by, cultural, outsiders, to, many, indigenous, spiritual, practices, the, words, shaman, and, shamanism, do, not, accurately, describe, the, variety, and, complexity, that, is, indigenous, spirituality, each, nation, and, tribe, has, its, own, way, of, life, and, uses, terms, in, their, own, languages, mircea, eliade, writes, a, first, definition, of, this, complex, phenomenon, and, perhaps, the, least, hazardous, will, be, shamanism, technique, of, religious, ecstasy, shamanism, encompasses, the, premise, that, shamans, are, intermediaries, or, messengers, between, the, human, world, and, the, spirit, worlds, shamans, are, said, to, treat, ailments, and, illnesses, by, mending, the, soul, alleviating, traumas, affecting, the, soul, or, spirit, are, believed, to, restore, the, physical, body, of, the, individual, to, balance, and, wholeness, shamans, also, claim, to, enter, supernatural, realms, or, dimensions, to, obtain, solutions, to, problems, afflicting, the, community, shamans, claim, to, visit, other, worlds, or, dimensions, to, bring, guidance, to, misguided, souls, and, to, ameliorate, illnesses, of, the, human, soul, caused, by, foreign, elements, shamans, operate, primarily, within, the, spiritual, world, which, they, believe, in, turn, affects, the, human, world, the, restoration, of, balance, is, said, to, result, in, the, elimination, of, the, ailment, the, anthropologist, alice, kehoe, criticizes, the, term, shaman, in, her, book, shamans, and, religion, an, anthropological, exploration, in, critical, thinking, part, of, this, criticism, involves, the, notion, of, cultural, appropriation, this, includes, criticism, of, new, age, and, modern, western, forms, of, shamanism, which, according, to, kehoe, misrepresent, or, dilute, indigenous, practices, kehoe, also, believes, that, the, term, reinforces, racist, ideas, such, as, the, noble, savage, kehoe, is, highly, critical, of, mircea, eliade, s, work, on, shamanism, as, an, invention, synthesized, from, various, sources, unsupported, by, more, direct, research, to, kehoe, citing, practices, such, as, drumming, trance, chanting, entheogen, and, hallucinogen, use, spirit, communication, and, healing, as, definitive, of, shamanism, ignores, the, fact, that, they, exist, outside, of, what, is, defined, as, shamanism, and, even, play, similar, roles, in, nonshamanic, cultures, for, example, chanting, in, the, abrahamic, religions, she, argues, that, these, expression, are, unique, to, each, culture, that, uses, them, and, that, such, practices, cannot, be, generalized, easily, accurately, or, usefully, into, a, global, religion, of, shamanism, because, of, this, kehoe, is, also, highly, critical, of, the, hypothesis, that, shamanism, is, an, ancient, unchanged, and, surviving, religion, from, the, paleolithic, period, the, term, has, been, criticized, for, its, perceived, colonial, roots, and, as, a, tool, to, perpetuate, perceived, contemporary, linguistic, colonialism, by, western, scholars, the, term, shamanism, is, used, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, different, cultures, and, practices, around, the, world, which, can, vary, dramatically, and, may, not, be, accurately, represented, by, a, single, concept, billy, ray, belcourt, an, author, and, award, winning, scholar, from, the, driftpile, cree, nation, in, canada, argues, that, using, language, with, the, intention, of, simplifying, culture, that, is, diverse, such, as, shamanism, as, it, is, prevalent, in, communities, around, the, world, and, is, made, up, of, many, complex, components, works, to, conceal, the, complexities, of, the, social, and, political, violence, that, indigenous, communities, have, experienced, at, the, hands, of, settlers, belcourt, argues, that, language, used, to, imply, simplicity, in, regards, to, indigenous, culture, is, a, tool, used, to, belittle, indigenous, cultures, as, it, views, indigenous, communities, solely, as, a, result, of, a, history, embroiled, in, violence, that, leaves, indigenous, communities, only, capable, of, simplicity, and, plainness, anthropologist, mih, ly, hopp, l, also, discusses, whether, the, term, shamanism, is, appropriate, he, notes, that, for, many, readers, ism, implies, a, particular, dogma, like, buddhism, catholicism, or, judaism, he, recommends, using, the, term, shamanhood, or, shamanship, a, term, used, in, old, russian, and, german, ethnographic, reports, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, for, stressing, the, diversity, and, the, specific, features, of, the, discussed, cultures, he, believes, that, this, places, more, stress, on, the, local, variations, and, emphasizes, that, shamanism, is, not, a, religion, of, sacred, dogmas, but, linked, to, the, everyday, life, in, a, practical, way, following, similar, thoughts, he, also, conjectures, a, contemporary, paradigm, shift, piers, vitebsky, also, mentions, that, despite, really, astonishing, similarities, there, is, no, unity, in, shamanism, the, various, fragmented, shamanistic, practices, and, beliefs, coexist, with, other, beliefs, everywhere, there, is, no, record, of, pure, shamanistic, societies, although, their, existence, is, not, impossible, norwegian, social, anthropologist, hakan, rydving, has, likewise, argued, for, the, abandonment, of, the, terms, shaman, and, shamanism, as, scientific, illusions, dulam, bumochir, has, affirmed, the, above, critiques, of, shamanism, as, a, western, construct, created, for, comparative, purposes, and, in, an, extensive, article, has, documented, the, role, of, mongols, themselves, particularly, the, partnership, of, scholars, and, shamans, in, the, reconstruction, of, shamanism, in, post, 1990, post, communist, mongolia, this, process, has, also, been, documented, by, swiss, anthropologist, judith, hangartner, in, her, landmark, study, of, darhad, shamans, in, mongolia, historian, karena, kollmar, polenz, argues, that, the, social, construction, and, reification, of, shamanism, as, a, religious, other, actually, began, with, the, 18th, century, writings, of, tibetan, buddhist, monks, in, mongolia, and, later, probably, influenced, the, formation, of, european, discourse, on, shamanism, shamanism, is, a, system, of, religious, practice, historically, it, is, often, associated, with, indigenous, and, tribal, societies, and, involves, belief, that, shamans, with, a, connection, to, the, otherworld, have, the, power, to, heal, the, sick, communicate, with, spirits, and, escort, souls, of, the, dead, to, the, afterlife, the, origins, of, shamanism, stem, from, indigenous, peoples, of, far, northern, europe, and, siberia, despite, structural, implications, of, colonialism, and, imperialism, that, have, limited, the, ability, of, indigenous, peoples, to, practice, traditional, spiritualities, many, communities, are, undergoing, resurgence, through, self, determination, and, the, reclamation, of, dynamic, traditions, other, groups, have, been, able, to, avoid, some, of, these, structural, impediments, by, virtue, of, their, isolation, such, as, the, nomadic, tuvan, with, an, estimated, population, of, 3000, people, surviving, from, this, tribe, tuva, is, one, of, the, most, isolated, asiatic, tribes, in, russia, where, the, art, of, shamanism, has, been, preserved, until, today, due, to, its, isolated, existence, allowing, it, to, be, free, from, the, influences, of, other, major, religions, there, are, many, variations, of, shamanism, throughout, the, world, but, several, common, beliefs, are, shared, by, all, forms, of, shamanism, common, beliefs, identified, by, eliade, 1972, are, the, following, as, alice, kehoe, notes, eliade, s, conceptualization, of, shamans, produces, a, universalist, image, of, indigenous, cultures, which, perpetuates, notions, of, the, dead, or, dying, indian, as, well, as, the, noble, savage, shamanism, is, based, on, the, premise, that, the, visible, world, is, pervaded, by, invisible, forces, or, spirits, which, affect, the, lives, of, the, living, although, the, causes, of, disease, lie, in, the, spiritual, realm, inspired, by, malicious, spirits, both, spiritual, and, physical, methods, are, used, to, heal, commonly, a, shaman, enters, the, body, of, the, patient, to, confront, the, spiritual, infirmity, and, heals, by, banishing, the, infectious, spirit, many, shamans, have, expert, knowledge, of, medicinal, plants, native, to, their, area, and, an, herbal, treatment, is, often, prescribed, in, many, places, shamans, learn, directly, from, the, plants, harnessing, their, effects, and, healing, properties, after, obtaining, permission, from, the, indwelling, or, patron, spirits, in, the, peruvian, amazon, basin, shamans, and, curanderos, use, medicine, songs, called, icaros, to, evoke, spirits, before, a, spirit, can, be, summoned, it, must, teach, the, shaman, its, song, the, use, of, totemic, items, such, as, rocks, with, special, powers, and, an, animating, spirit, is, common, such, practices, are, presumably, very, ancient, plato, wrote, in, his, phaedrus, that, the, first, prophecies, were, the, words, of, an, oak, and, that, those, who, lived, at, that, time, found, it, rewarding, enough, to, listen, to, an, oak, or, a, stone, so, long, as, it, was, telling, the, truth, belief, in, witchcraft, and, sorcery, known, as, brujer, a, in, latin, america, exists, in, many, societies, other, societies, assert, all, shamans, have, the, power, to, both, cure, and, kill, those, with, shamanic, knowledge, usually, enjoy, great, power, and, prestige, in, the, community, but, they, may, also, be, regarded, suspiciously, or, fearfully, as, potentially, harmful, to, others, by, engaging, in, their, work, a, shaman, is, exposed, to, significant, personal, risk, as, shamanic, plant, materials, can, be, toxic, or, fatal, if, misused, spells, are, commonly, used, in, an, attempt, to, protect, against, these, dangers, and, the, use, of, more, dangerous, plants, is, often, very, highly, ritualized, generally, shamans, traverse, the, axis, mundi, and, enter, the, spirit, world, by, effecting, a, transition, of, consciousness, entering, into, an, ecstatic, trance, either, autohypnotically, or, through, the, use, of, entheogens, or, ritual, performances, the, methods, employed, are, diverse, and, are, often, used, together, just, like, shamanism, itself, music, and, songs, related, to, it, in, various, cultures, are, diverse, in, several, instances, songs, related, to, shamanism, are, intended, to, imitate, natural, sounds, via, onomatopoeia, sound, mimesis, in, various, cultures, may, serve, other, functions, not, necessarily, related, to, shamanism, practical, goals, such, as, luring, game, in, the, hunt, or, entertainment, inuit, throat, singing, shamans, often, claim, to, have, been, called, through, dreams, or, signs, however, some, say, their, powers, are, inherited, in, traditional, societies, shamanic, training, varies, in, length, but, generally, takes, years, turner, and, colleagues, mention, a, phenomenon, called, shamanistic, initiatory, crisis, a, rite, of, passage, for, shamans, to, be, commonly, involving, physical, illness, or, psychological, crisis, the, significant, role, of, initiatory, illnesses, in, the, calling, of, a, shaman, can, be, found, in, the, case, history, of, chuonnasuan, who, was, one, of, the, last, shamans, among, the, tungus, peoples, in, northeast, china, the, wounded, healer, is, an, archetype, for, a, shamanic, trial, and, journey, this, process, is, important, to, young, shamans, they, undergo, a, type, of, sickness, that, pushes, them, to, the, brink, of, death, this, is, said, to, happen, for, two, reasons, shamans, may, employ, varying, materials, in, spiritual, practice, in, different, cultures, shamans, have, been, conceptualized, as, those, who, are, able, to, gain, knowledge, and, power, to, heal, in, the, spiritual, world, or, dimension, most, shamans, have, dreams, or, visions, that, convey, certain, messages, shamans, may, claim, to, have, or, have, acquired, many, spirit, guides, who, they, believe, guide, and, direct, them, in, their, travels, in, the, spirit, world, these, spirit, guides, are, always, thought, to, be, present, within, the, shaman, although, others, are, said, to, encounter, them, only, when, the, shaman, is, in, a, trance, the, spirit, guide, energizes, the, shamans, enabling, them, to, enter, the, spiritual, dimension, shamans, claim, to, heal, within, the, communities, and, the, spiritual, dimension, by, returning, lost, parts, of, the, human, soul, from, wherever, they, have, gone, shamans, also, claim, to, cleanse, excess, negative, energies, which, are, said, to, confuse, or, pollute, the, soul, shamans, act, as, mediators, in, their, cultures, shamans, claim, to, communicate, with, the, spirits, on, behalf, of, the, community, including, the, spirits, of, the, deceased, shamans, believe, they, can, communicate, with, both, living, and, dead, to, alleviate, unrest, unsettled, issues, and, to, deliver, gifts, to, the, spirits, shamans, perform, a, variety, of, functions, depending, upon, their, respective, cultures, healing, leading, a, sacrifice, preserving, traditions, by, storytelling, and, songs, fortune, telling, and, acting, as, a, psychopomp, guide, of, souls, a, single, shaman, may, fulfill, several, of, these, functions, the, responsibilities, of, a, shaman, may, include, either, guiding, to, their, proper, abode, the, souls, of, the, dead, which, may, be, guided, either, one, at, a, time, or, in, a, group, depending, on, the, culture, and, the, curing, of, ailments, the, ailments, may, be, either, purely, physical, afflictions, such, as, disease, which, are, claimed, to, be, cured, by, gifting, flattering, threatening, or, wrestling, the, disease, spirit, sometimes, trying, all, these, sequentially, and, which, may, be, completed, by, displaying, a, supposedly, extracted, token, of, the, disease, spirit, displaying, this, even, if, fraudulent, is, supposed, to, impress, the, disease, spirit, that, it, has, been, or, is, in, the, process, of, being, defeated, so, that, it, will, retreat, and, stay, out, of, the, patient, s, body, or, else, mental, including, psychosomatic, afflictions, such, as, persistent, terror, which, is, likewise, believed, to, be, cured, by, similar, methods, in, most, languages, a, different, term, other, than, the, one, translated, shaman, is, usually, applied, to, a, religious, official, leading, sacrificial, rites, priest, or, to, a, raconteur, sage, of, traditional, lore, there, may, be, more, of, an, overlap, in, functions, with, that, of, a, shaman, however, in, the, case, of, an, interpreter, of, omens, or, of, dreams, there, are, distinct, types, of, shamans, who, perform, more, specialized, functions, for, example, among, the, nanai, people, a, distinct, kind, of, shaman, acts, as, a, psychopomp, other, specialized, shamans, may, be, distinguished, according, to, the, type, of, spirits, or, realms, of, the, spirit, world, with, which, the, shaman, most, commonly, interacts, these, roles, vary, among, the, nenets, enets, and, selkup, shamans, the, assistant, of, an, oroqen, shaman, called, jardalanin, or, second, spirit, knows, many, things, about, the, associated, beliefs, he, or, she, accompanies, the, rituals, and, interprets, the, behaviors, of, the, shaman, despite, these, functions, the, jardalanin, is, not, a, shaman, for, this, interpretative, assistant, it, would, be, unwelcome, to, fall, into, a, trance, as, the, primary, teacher, of, tribal, symbolism, the, shaman, may, have, a, leading, role, in, this, ecological, management, actively, restricting, hunting, and, fishing, among, the, tucano, people, a, sophisticated, system, exists, for, environmental, resources, management, and, for, avoiding, resource, depletion, through, overhunting, this, system, is, conceptualized, mythologically, and, symbolically, by, the, belief, that, breaking, hunting, restrictions, may, cause, illness, the, shaman, is, able, to, release, game, animals, or, their, souls, from, their, hidden, abodes, the, piaroa, people, have, ecological, concerns, related, to, shamanism, among, the, inuit, the, angakkuq, shamans, fetch, the, souls, of, game, from, remote, places, or, soul, travel, to, ask, for, game, from, mythological, beings, like, the, sea, woman, the, way, shamans, get, sustenance, and, take, part, in, everyday, life, varies, across, cultures, in, many, inuit, groups, they, provide, services, for, the, community, and, get, a, due, payment, and, believe, the, payment, is, given, to, the, helping, spirits, an, account, states, that, the, gifts, and, payments, that, a, shaman, receives, are, given, by, his, partner, spirit, since, it, obliges, the, shaman, to, use, his, gift, and, to, work, regularly, in, this, capacity, the, spirit, rewards, him, with, the, goods, that, it, receives, these, goods, however, are, only, welcome, addenda, they, are, not, enough, to, enable, a, full, time, shaman, shamans, live, like, any, other, member, of, the, group, as, a, hunter, or, housewife, due, to, the, popularity, of, ayahuasca, tourism, in, south, america, there, are, practitioners, in, areas, frequented, by, backpackers, who, make, a, living, from, leading, ceremonies, furthermore, due, to, the, predominant, number, of, female, shamans, over, males, shamanism, was, and, continues, to, be, an, integral, part, of, women, s, economic, liberation, shamanism, often, serves, as, an, economic, resource, due, to, the, requirement, of, payment, for, service, this, economic, revenue, was, vital, for, female, shamans, especially, those, living, during, the, chosun, dynasty, in, korea, a, d, 1392, 1910, in, a, culture, that, disapproved, of, female, economic, autonomy, the, practice, of, shamanism, allowed, women, to, advance, themselves, financially, and, independently, in, a, way, that, had, not, been, possible, for, them, before, there, are, two, major, frameworks, among, cognitive, and, evolutionary, scientists, for, explaining, shamanism, the, first, proposed, by, anthropologist, michael, winkelman, is, known, as, the, neurotheological, theory, according, to, winkelman, shamanism, develops, reliably, in, human, societies, because, it, provides, valuable, benefits, to, the, practitioner, their, group, and, individual, clients, in, particular, the, trance, states, induced, by, dancing, hallucinogens, and, other, triggers, are, hypothesized, to, have, an, integrative, effect, on, cognition, allowing, communication, among, mental, systems, that, specialize, in, theory, of, mind, social, intelligence, and, natural, history, with, this, cognitive, integration, the, shaman, can, better, predict, the, movement, of, animals, resolve, group, conflicts, plan, migrations, and, provide, other, useful, services, the, neurotheological, theory, contrasts, with, the, by, product, or, subjective, model, of, shamanism, developed, by, harvard, anthropologist, manvir, singh, according, to, singh, shamanism, is, a, cultural, technology, that, adapts, to, or, hacks, our, psychological, biases, to, convince, us, that, a, specialist, can, influence, important, but, uncontrollable, outcomes, citing, work, on, the, psychology, of, magic, and, superstition, singh, argues, that, humans, search, for, ways, of, influencing, uncertain, events, such, as, healing, illness, controlling, rain, or, attracting, animals, as, specialists, compete, to, help, their, clients, control, these, outcomes, they, drive, the, evolution, of, psychologically, compelling, magic, producing, traditions, adapted, to, people, s, cognitive, biases, shamanism, singh, argues, is, the, culmination, of, this, cultural, evolutionary, process, a, psychologically, appealing, method, for, controlling, uncertainty, for, example, some, shamanic, practices, exploit, our, intuitions, about, humanness, practitioners, use, trance, and, dramatic, initiations, to, seemingly, become, entities, distinct, from, normal, humans, and, thus, more, apparently, capable, of, interacting, with, the, invisible, forces, believed, to, oversee, important, outcomes, influential, cognitive, and, anthropological, scientists, such, as, pascal, boyer, and, nicholas, humphrey, have, endorsed, singh, s, approach, although, other, researchers, have, criticized, singh, s, dismissal, of, individual, and, group, level, benefits, gerardo, reichel, dolmatoff, relates, these, concepts, to, developments, in, the, ways, that, modern, science, systems, theory, ecology, new, approaches, in, anthropology, and, archeology, treats, causality, in, a, less, linear, fashion, he, also, suggests, a, cooperation, of, modern, science, and, indigenous, lore, shamanic, practices, may, originate, as, early, as, the, paleolithic, predating, all, organized, religions, and, certainly, as, early, as, the, neolithic, period, the, earliest, known, undisputed, burial, of, a, shaman, and, by, extension, the, earliest, undisputed, evidence, of, shamans, and, shamanic, practices, dates, back, to, the, early, upper, paleolithic, era, c, 30, 000, bp, in, what, is, now, the, czech, republic, sanskrit, scholar, and, comparative, mythologist, michael, witzel, proposes, that, all, of, the, world, s, mythologies, and, also, the, concepts, and, practices, of, shamans, can, be, traced, to, the, migrations, of, two, prehistoric, populations, the, gondwana, type, of, circa, 65, 000, years, ago, and, the, laurasian, type, of, circa, 40, 000, years, ago, in, november, 2008, researchers, from, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, announced, the, discovery, of, a, 12, 000, year, old, site, in, israel, that, is, perceived, as, one, of, the, earliest, known, shaman, burials, the, elderly, woman, had, been, arranged, on, her, side, with, her, legs, apart, and, folded, inward, at, the, knee, ten, large, stones, were, placed, on, the, head, pelvis, and, arms, among, her, unusual, grave, goods, were, 50, complete, tortoise, shells, a, human, foot, and, certain, body, parts, from, animals, such, as, a, cow, tail, and, eagle, wings, other, animal, remains, came, from, a, boar, leopard, and, two, martens, it, seems, that, the, woman, was, perceived, as, being, in, a, close, relationship, with, these, animal, spirits, researchers, noted, the, grave, was, one, of, at, least, 28, graves, at, the, site, located, in, a, cave, in, lower, galilee, and, belonging, to, the, natufian, culture, but, is, said, to, be, unlike, any, other, among, the, epipaleolithic, natufians, or, in, the, paleolithic, period, a, debated, etymology, of, the, word, shaman, is, one, who, knows, implying, among, other, things, that, the, shaman, is, an, expert, in, keeping, together, the, multiple, codes, of, the, society, and, that, to, be, effective, shamans, must, maintain, a, comprehensive, view, in, their, mind, which, gives, them, certainty, of, knowledge, according, to, this, view, the, shaman, uses, and, the, audience, understands, multiple, codes, expressing, meanings, in, many, ways, verbally, musically, artistically, and, in, dance, meanings, may, be, manifested, in, objects, such, as, amulets, if, the, shaman, knows, the, culture, of, their, community, well, and, acts, accordingly, their, audience, will, know, the, used, symbols, and, meanings, and, therefore, trust, the, shamanic, worker, there, are, also, semiotic, theoretical, approaches, to, shamanism, and, examples, of, mutually, opposing, symbols, in, academic, studies, of, siberian, lore, distinguishing, a, white, shaman, who, contacts, sky, spirits, for, good, aims, by, day, from, a, black, shaman, who, contacts, evil, spirits, for, bad, aims, by, night, series, of, such, opposing, symbols, referred, to, a, world, view, behind, them, analogously, to, the, way, grammar, arranges, words, to, express, meanings, and, convey, a, world, also, this, formed, a, cognitive, map, shaman, s, lore, is, rooted, in, the, folklore, of, the, community, which, provides, a, mythological, mental, map, juha, pentik, inen, uses, the, concept, grammar, of, mind, armin, geertz, coined, and, introduced, the, hermeneutics, or, ethnohermeneutics, interpretation, hopp, l, extended, the, term, to, include, not, only, the, interpretation, of, oral, and, written, texts, but, that, of, visual, texts, as, well, including, motions, gestures, and, more, complex, rituals, and, ceremonies, performed, for, instance, by, shamans, revealing, the, animistic, views, in, shamanism, but, also, their, relevance, to, the, contemporary, world, where, ecological, problems, have, validated, paradigms, of, balance, and, protection, in, many, societies, where, shamanism, is, practiced, the, understanding, and, treatment, of, illness, are, closely, tied, to, social, and, cultural, processes, disease, is, often, seen, not, just, as, a, biological, condition, but, as, a, disruption, in, the, balance, of, spiritual, and, social, relationships, the, concept, of, the, body, in, these, contexts, is, multifaceted, encompassing, physical, social, and, cultural, dimensions, anthropologists, nancy, scheper, hughes, and, margaret, lock, expand, on, this, by, introducing, the, idea, of, the, three, bodies, the, individual, body, relating, to, personal, health, experiences, the, social, body, connecting, health, to, social, and, cultural, values, and, the, body, politic, reflecting, the, influence, of, power, structures, on, health, outcomes, according, to, anthropologist, donald, joralemon, the, practice, of, medicine, is, inherently, a, social, process, both, in, shamanistic, societies, and, contemporary, biomedicine, joralemon, argues, that, healing, rituals, diagnoses, and, treatments, are, deeply, embedded, in, the, cultural, norms, and, social, expectations, of, a, community, this, is, particularly, evident, in, shamanism, where, the, shaman, addresses, not, only, physical, symptoms, but, also, the, spiritual, and, communal, aspects, of, illness, the, shaman, s, role, is, to, restore, harmony, within, the, individual, and, the, community, reinforcing, the, social, bonds, believed, to, influence, health, joralemon, emphasizes, that, in, both, traditional, and, modern, medical, practices, disease, is, not, merely, a, biological, fact, but, a, social, phenomenon, shaped, by, the, cultural, and, societal, contexts, in, which, it, occurs, where, a, shaman, is, present, within, a, community, the, group, determines, whether, an, individual, is, true, shaman, or, not, the, group, also, determines, whether, an, individual, is, sick, and, doomed, by, sorcery, this, is, where, a, shaman, is, given, the, role, to, dispel, an, illness, the, shaman, does, not, become, a, great, shaman, because, they, cure, a, person, it, is, because, they, are, known, by, the, group, as, great, shamans, community, members, known, as, dreamers, also, listen, in, on, private, conversations, to, convey, an, individual, s, known, sickness, traditional, indigenous, shamanism, is, believed, to, be, declining, around, the, world, whalers, who, frequently, interacted, with, inuit, groups, are, one, source, of, this, decline, in, that, region, in, many, areas, former, shamans, ceased, to, fulfill, the, functions, in, the, community, they, used, to, as, they, felt, mocked, by, their, own, community, or, regarded, their, own, past, as, deprecated, and, were, unwilling, to, talk, about, it, to, ethnographers, besides, personal, communications, of, former, shamans, folklore, texts, may, narrate, directly, about, a, deterioration, process, for, example, a, buryat, epic, text, details, the, wonderful, deeds, of, the, ancient, first, shaman, kara, g, rg, n, he, could, even, compete, with, god, create, life, steal, back, the, soul, of, the, sick, from, god, without, his, consent, a, subsequent, text, laments, that, shamans, of, older, times, were, stronger, possessing, capabilities, like, omnividence, fortune, telling, even, for, decades, in, the, future, moving, as, fast, as, a, bullet, in, most, affected, areas, shamanic, practices, ceased, to, exist, with, authentic, shamans, dying, and, their, personal, experiences, dying, with, them, the, loss, of, memories, is, not, always, lessened, by, the, fact, the, shaman, is, not, always, the, only, person, in, a, community, who, knows, the, beliefs, and, motives, related, to, the, local, shaman, hood, although, the, shaman, is, often, believed, and, trusted, precisely, because, they, accommodate, to, the, beliefs, of, the, community, several, parts, of, the, knowledge, related, to, the, local, shamanhood, consist, of, personal, experiences, of, the, shaman, or, root, in, their, family, life, thus, those, are, lost, with, their, death, besides, that, in, many, cultures, the, entire, traditional, belief, system, has, become, endangered, often, together, with, a, partial, or, total, language, shift, with, the, other, people, of, the, community, remembering, the, associated, beliefs, and, practices, or, the, language, at, all, grew, old, or, died, many, folklore, memories, songs, and, texts, were, forgotten, which, may, threaten, even, such, peoples, who, could, preserve, their, isolation, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, like, the, nganasan, some, areas, could, enjoy, a, prolonged, resistance, due, to, their, remoteness, after, exemplifying, the, general, decline, even, in, the, most, remote, areas, there, are, revitalizations, or, tradition, preserving, efforts, as, a, response, besides, collecting, the, memories, there, are, also, tradition, preserving, and, even, revitalization, efforts, led, by, authentic, former, shamans, for, example, among, the, sakha, people, and, tuvans, native, americans, in, the, united, states, do, not, call, their, traditional, spiritual, ways, shamanism, however, according, to, richard, l, allen, research, and, policy, analyst, for, the, cherokee, nation, they, are, regularly, overwhelmed, with, inquiries, by, and, about, fraudulent, shamans, aka, plastic, medicine, people, he, adds, one, may, assume, that, anyone, claiming, to, be, a, cherokee, shaman, spiritual, healer, or, pipe, carrier, is, equivalent, to, a, modern, day, medicine, show, and, snake, oil, vendor, there, are, also, neoshamanistic, movements, which, usually, differ, from, traditional, shamanistic, practice, and, beliefs, in, significant, ways, and, often, have, more, connection, to, the, new, age, communities, than, traditional, cultures
