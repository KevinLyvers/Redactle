ethics, is, the, philosophical, study, of, moral, phenomena, also, called, moral, philosophy, it, investigates, normative, questions, about, what, people, ought, to, do, or, which, behavior, is, morally, right, its, main, branches, include, normative, ethics, applied, ethics, and, metaethics, normative, ethics, aims, to, find, general, principles, that, govern, how, people, should, act, applied, ethics, examines, concrete, ethical, problems, in, real, life, situations, such, as, abortion, treatment, of, animals, and, business, practices, metaethics, explores, the, underlying, assumptions, and, concepts, of, ethics, it, asks, whether, there, are, objective, moral, facts, how, moral, knowledge, is, possible, and, how, moral, judgments, motivate, people, influential, normative, theories, are, consequentialism, deontology, and, virtue, ethics, according, to, consequentialists, an, act, is, right, if, it, leads, to, the, best, consequences, deontologists, focus, on, acts, themselves, saying, that, they, must, adhere, to, duties, like, telling, the, truth, and, keeping, promises, virtue, ethics, sees, the, manifestation, of, virtues, like, courage, and, compassion, as, the, fundamental, principle, of, morality, ethics, is, closely, connected, to, value, theory, which, studies, the, nature, and, types, of, value, like, the, contrast, between, intrinsic, and, instrumental, value, moral, psychology, is, a, related, empirical, field, and, investigates, psychological, processes, involved, in, morality, such, as, reasoning, and, the, formation, of, character, descriptive, ethics, describes, the, dominant, moral, codes, and, beliefs, in, different, societies, and, considers, their, historical, dimension, the, history, of, ethics, started, in, the, ancient, period, with, the, development, of, ethical, principles, and, theories, in, ancient, egypt, india, china, and, greece, this, period, saw, the, emergence, of, ethical, teachings, associated, with, hinduism, buddhism, confucianism, daoism, and, contributions, of, philosophers, like, socrates, and, aristotle, during, the, medieval, period, ethical, thought, was, strongly, influenced, by, religious, teachings, in, the, modern, period, this, focus, shifted, to, a, more, secular, approach, concerned, with, moral, experience, reasons, for, acting, and, the, consequences, of, actions, an, influential, development, in, the, 20th, century, was, the, emergence, of, metaethics, ethics, also, called, moral, philosophy, is, the, study, of, moral, phenomena, it, is, one, of, the, main, branches, of, philosophy, and, investigates, the, nature, of, morality, and, the, principles, that, govern, the, moral, evaluation, of, conduct, character, traits, and, institutions, it, examines, what, obligations, people, have, what, behavior, is, right, and, wrong, and, how, to, lead, a, good, life, some, of, its, key, questions, are, how, should, one, live, and, what, gives, meaning, to, life, in, contemporary, philosophy, ethics, is, usually, divided, into, normative, ethics, applied, ethics, and, metaethics, morality, is, about, what, people, ought, to, do, rather, than, what, they, actually, do, what, they, want, to, do, or, what, social, conventions, require, as, a, rational, and, systematic, field, of, inquiry, ethics, studies, practical, reasons, why, people, should, act, one, way, rather, than, another, most, ethical, theories, seek, universal, principles, that, express, a, general, standpoint, of, what, is, objectively, right, and, wrong, in, a, slightly, different, sense, the, term, ethics, can, also, refer, to, individual, ethical, theories, in, the, form, of, a, rational, system, of, moral, principles, such, as, aristotelian, ethics, and, to, a, moral, code, that, certain, societies, social, groups, or, professions, follow, as, in, protestant, work, ethic, and, medical, ethics, the, english, word, ethics, has, its, roots, in, the, ancient, greek, word, thos, meaning, character, and, personal, disposition, this, word, gave, rise, to, the, ancient, greek, word, thik, s, which, was, translated, into, latin, as, ethica, and, entered, the, english, language, in, the, 15th, century, through, the, old, french, term, thique, the, term, morality, originates, in, the, latin, word, moralis, meaning, manners, and, character, it, was, introduced, into, the, english, language, during, the, middle, english, period, through, the, old, french, term, moralit, the, terms, ethics, and, morality, are, usually, used, interchangeably, but, some, philosophers, distinguish, between, the, two, according, to, one, view, morality, focuses, on, what, moral, obligations, people, have, while, ethics, is, broader, and, includes, ideas, about, what, is, good, and, how, to, lead, a, meaningful, life, another, difference, is, that, codes, of, conduct, in, specific, areas, such, as, business, and, environment, are, usually, termed, ethics, rather, than, morality, as, in, business, ethics, and, environmental, ethics, normative, ethics, is, the, philosophical, study, of, ethical, conduct, and, investigates, the, fundamental, principles, of, morality, it, aims, to, discover, and, justify, general, answers, to, questions, like, how, should, one, live, and, how, should, people, act, usually, in, the, form, of, universal, or, domain, independent, principles, that, determine, whether, an, act, is, right, or, wrong, for, example, given, the, particular, impression, that, it, is, wrong, to, set, a, child, on, fire, for, fun, normative, ethics, aims, to, find, more, general, principles, that, explain, why, this, is, the, case, like, the, principle, that, one, should, not, cause, extreme, suffering, to, the, innocent, which, may, itself, be, explained, in, terms, of, a, more, general, principle, many, theories, of, normative, ethics, also, aim, to, guide, behavior, by, helping, people, make, moral, decisions, theories, in, normative, ethics, state, how, people, should, act, or, what, kind, of, behavior, is, correct, they, do, not, aim, to, describe, how, people, normally, act, what, moral, beliefs, ordinary, people, have, how, these, beliefs, change, over, time, or, what, ethical, codes, are, upheld, in, certain, social, groups, these, topics, belong, to, descriptive, ethics, and, are, studied, in, fields, like, anthropology, sociology, and, history, rather, than, normative, ethics, some, systems, of, normative, ethics, arrive, at, a, single, principle, covering, all, possible, cases, others, encompass, a, small, set, of, basic, rules, that, address, all, or, at, least, the, most, important, moral, considerations, one, difficulty, for, systems, with, several, basic, principles, is, that, these, principles, may, conflict, with, each, other, in, some, cases, and, lead, to, ethical, dilemmas, distinct, theories, in, normative, ethics, suggest, different, principles, as, the, foundation, of, morality, the, three, most, influential, schools, of, thought, are, consequentialism, deontology, and, virtue, ethics, these, schools, are, usually, presented, as, exclusive, alternatives, but, depending, on, how, they, are, defined, they, can, overlap, and, do, not, necessarily, exclude, one, another, in, some, cases, they, differ, in, which, acts, they, see, as, right, or, wrong, in, other, cases, they, recommend, the, same, course, of, action, but, provide, different, justifications, for, why, it, is, right, consequentialism, also, called, teleological, ethics, says, that, morality, depends, on, consequences, according, to, the, most, common, view, an, act, is, right, if, it, brings, the, best, future, this, means, that, there, is, no, alternative, course, of, action, that, has, better, consequences, a, key, aspect, of, consequentialist, theories, is, that, they, provide, a, characterization, of, what, is, good, and, then, define, what, is, right, in, terms, of, what, is, good, for, example, classical, utilitarianism, says, that, pleasure, is, good, and, that, the, action, leading, to, the, most, overall, pleasure, is, right, consequentialism, has, been, discussed, indirectly, since, the, formulation, of, classical, utilitarianism, in, the, late, 18th, century, a, more, explicit, analysis, of, this, view, happened, in, the, 20th, century, when, the, term, was, coined, by, g, e, m, anscombe, consequentialists, usually, understand, the, consequences, of, an, action, in, a, very, wide, sense, that, includes, the, totality, of, its, effects, this, is, based, on, the, idea, that, actions, make, a, difference, in, the, world, by, bringing, about, a, causal, chain, of, events, that, would, not, have, existed, otherwise, a, core, intuition, behind, consequentialism, is, that, the, future, should, be, shaped, to, achieve, the, best, possible, outcome, the, act, itself, is, usually, not, seen, as, part, of, the, consequences, this, means, that, if, an, act, has, intrinsic, value, or, disvalue, it, is, not, included, as, a, factor, some, consequentialists, see, this, as, a, flaw, saying, that, all, value, relevant, factors, need, to, be, considered, they, try, to, avoid, this, complication, by, including, the, act, itself, as, part, of, the, consequences, a, related, approach, is, to, characterize, consequentialism, not, in, terms, of, consequences, but, in, terms, of, outcome, with, the, outcome, being, defined, as, the, act, together, with, its, consequences, most, forms, of, consequentialism, are, agent, neutral, this, means, that, the, value, of, consequences, is, assessed, from, a, neutral, perspective, that, is, acts, should, have, consequences, that, are, good, in, general, and, not, just, good, for, the, agent, it, is, controversial, whether, agent, relative, moral, theories, like, ethical, egoism, should, be, considered, as, types, of, consequentialism, there, are, many, different, types, of, consequentialism, they, differ, based, on, what, type, of, entity, they, evaluate, what, consequences, they, take, into, consideration, and, how, they, determine, the, value, of, consequences, most, theories, assess, the, moral, value, of, acts, however, consequentialism, can, also, be, used, to, evaluate, motives, character, traits, rules, and, policies, many, types, assess, the, value, of, consequences, based, on, whether, they, promote, happiness, or, suffering, but, there, are, also, alternative, evaluative, principles, such, as, desire, satisfaction, autonomy, freedom, knowledge, friendship, beauty, and, self, perfection, some, forms, of, consequentialism, hold, that, there, is, only, a, single, source, of, value, the, most, prominent, among, them, is, utilitarianism, which, states, that, the, moral, value, of, acts, only, depends, on, the, pleasure, and, suffering, they, cause, an, alternative, approach, says, that, there, are, many, different, sources, of, value, which, all, contribute, to, one, overall, value, before, the, 20th, century, consequentialists, were, only, concerned, with, the, total, of, value, or, the, aggregate, good, in, the, 20th, century, alternative, views, were, developed, that, additionally, consider, the, distribution, of, value, one, of, them, states, that, an, equal, distribution, of, goods, is, better, than, an, unequal, distribution, even, if, the, aggregate, good, is, the, same, there, are, disagreements, about, which, consequences, should, be, assessed, an, important, distinction, is, between, act, consequentialism, and, rule, consequentialism, according, to, act, consequentialism, the, consequences, of, an, act, determine, its, moral, value, this, means, that, there, is, a, direct, relation, between, the, consequences, of, an, act, and, its, moral, value, rule, consequentialism, by, contrast, holds, that, an, act, is, right, if, it, follows, a, certain, set, of, rules, rule, consequentialism, determines, the, best, rules, by, considering, their, outcomes, at, a, community, level, people, should, follow, the, rules, that, lead, to, the, best, consequences, when, everyone, in, the, community, follows, them, this, implies, that, the, relation, between, an, act, and, its, consequences, is, indirect, for, example, if, telling, the, truth, is, one, of, the, best, rules, then, according, to, rule, consequentialism, a, person, should, tell, the, truth, even, in, specific, cases, where, lying, would, lead, to, better, consequences, another, disagreement, is, between, actual, and, expected, consequentialism, according, to, the, traditional, view, only, the, actual, consequences, of, an, act, affect, its, moral, value, one, difficulty, of, this, view, is, that, many, consequences, cannot, be, known, in, advance, this, means, that, in, some, cases, even, well, planned, and, intentioned, acts, are, morally, wrong, if, they, inadvertently, lead, to, negative, outcomes, an, alternative, perspective, states, that, what, matters, are, not, the, actual, consequences, but, the, expected, consequences, this, view, takes, into, account, that, when, deciding, what, to, do, people, have, to, rely, on, their, limited, knowledge, of, the, total, consequences, of, their, actions, according, to, this, view, a, course, of, action, has, positive, moral, value, despite, leading, to, an, overall, negative, outcome, if, it, had, the, highest, expected, value, for, example, because, the, negative, outcome, could, not, be, anticipated, or, was, unlikely, a, further, difference, is, between, maximizing, and, satisficing, consequentialism, according, to, maximizing, consequentialism, only, the, best, possible, act, is, morally, permitted, this, means, that, acts, with, positive, consequences, are, wrong, if, there, are, alternatives, with, even, better, consequences, one, criticism, of, maximizing, consequentialism, is, that, it, demands, too, much, by, requiring, that, people, do, significantly, more, than, they, are, socially, expected, to, for, example, if, the, best, action, for, someone, with, a, good, salary, would, be, to, donate, 70, of, their, income, to, charity, it, would, be, morally, wrong, for, them, to, only, donate, 65, satisficing, consequentialism, by, contrast, only, requires, that, an, act, is, good, enough, even, if, it, is, not, the, best, possible, alternative, according, to, this, view, it, is, possible, to, do, more, than, one, is, morally, required, to, do, mohism, in, ancient, chinese, philosophy, is, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, consequentialism, it, arose, in, the, 5th, century, bce, and, argued, that, political, action, should, promote, justice, as, a, means, to, increase, the, welfare, of, the, people, the, most, well, known, form, of, consequentialism, is, utilitarianism, in, its, classical, form, it, is, an, act, consequentialism, that, sees, happiness, as, the, only, source, of, intrinsic, value, this, means, that, an, act, is, morally, right, if, it, produces, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, by, increasing, happiness, and, reducing, suffering, utilitarians, do, not, deny, that, other, things, also, have, value, like, health, friendship, and, knowledge, however, they, deny, that, these, things, have, intrinsic, value, instead, they, say, that, they, have, extrinsic, value, because, they, affect, happiness, and, suffering, in, this, regard, they, are, desirable, as, a, means, but, unlike, happiness, not, as, an, end, the, view, that, pleasure, is, the, only, thing, with, intrinsic, value, is, called, ethical, or, evaluative, hedonism, classical, utilitarianism, was, initially, formulated, by, jeremy, bentham, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, further, developed, by, john, stuart, mill, bentham, introduced, the, hedonic, calculus, to, assess, the, value, of, consequences, two, key, aspects, of, the, hedonic, calculus, are, the, intensity, and, the, duration, of, pleasure, according, to, this, view, a, pleasurable, experience, has, a, high, value, if, it, has, a, high, intensity, and, lasts, for, a, long, time, a, common, criticism, of, bentham, s, utilitarianism, argued, that, its, focus, on, the, intensity, of, pleasure, promotes, an, immoral, lifestyle, centered, around, indulgence, in, sensory, gratification, mill, responded, to, this, criticism, by, distinguishing, between, higher, and, lower, pleasures, he, stated, that, higher, pleasures, like, the, intellectual, satisfaction, of, reading, a, book, are, more, valuable, than, lower, pleasures, like, the, sensory, enjoyment, of, food, and, drink, even, if, their, intensity, and, duration, are, the, same, since, its, original, formulation, many, variations, of, utilitarianism, have, developed, including, the, difference, between, act, and, rule, utilitarianism, and, between, maximizing, and, satisficing, utilitarianism, deontology, assesses, the, moral, rightness, of, actions, based, on, a, set, of, norms, or, principles, these, norms, describe, the, requirements, that, all, actions, need, to, follow, they, may, include, principles, like, telling, the, truth, keeping, promises, and, not, intentionally, harming, others, unlike, consequentialists, deontologists, hold, that, the, validity, of, general, moral, principles, does, not, directly, depend, on, their, consequences, they, state, that, these, principles, should, be, followed, in, every, case, since, they, express, how, actions, are, inherently, right, or, wrong, according, to, moral, philosopher, david, ross, it, is, wrong, to, break, a, promise, even, if, no, harm, comes, from, it, deontologists, are, interested, in, which, actions, are, right, and, often, allow, that, there, is, a, gap, between, what, is, right, and, what, is, good, many, focus, on, prohibitions, and, describe, which, acts, are, forbidden, under, any, circumstances, agent, centered, deontological, theories, focus, on, the, person, who, acts, and, the, duties, they, have, agent, centered, theories, often, focus, on, the, motives, and, intentions, behind, people, s, actions, highlighting, the, importance, of, acting, for, the, right, reasons, they, tend, to, be, agent, relative, meaning, that, the, reasons, for, which, people, should, act, depend, on, personal, circumstances, for, example, a, parent, has, a, special, obligation, to, their, child, while, a, stranger, does, not, have, this, kind, of, obligation, toward, a, child, they, do, not, know, patient, centered, theories, by, contrast, focus, on, the, people, affected, by, actions, and, the, rights, they, have, an, example, is, the, requirement, to, treat, other, people, as, ends, and, not, merely, as, a, means, to, an, end, this, requirement, can, be, used, to, argue, for, example, that, it, is, wrong, to, kill, a, person, against, their, will, even, if, this, act, would, save, the, lives, of, several, others, patient, centered, deontological, theories, are, usually, agent, neutral, meaning, that, they, apply, equally, to, everyone, in, a, situation, regardless, of, their, specific, role, or, position, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, is, one, of, the, most, well, known, deontologists, he, states, that, reaching, outcomes, that, people, desire, such, as, being, happy, is, not, the, main, purpose, of, moral, actions, instead, he, argues, that, there, are, universal, principles, that, apply, to, everyone, independent, of, their, desires, he, uses, the, term, categorical, imperative, for, these, principles, saying, that, they, have, their, source, in, the, structure, of, practical, reason, and, are, true, for, all, rational, agents, according, to, kant, to, act, morally, is, to, act, in, agreement, with, reason, as, expressed, by, these, principles, while, violating, them, is, both, immoral, and, irrational, kant, provided, several, formulations, of, the, categorical, imperative, one, formulation, says, that, a, person, should, only, follow, maxims, that, can, be, universalized, this, means, that, the, person, would, want, everyone, to, follow, the, same, maxim, as, a, universal, law, applicable, to, everyone, another, formulation, states, that, one, should, treat, other, people, always, as, ends, in, themselves, and, never, as, mere, means, to, an, end, this, formulation, focuses, on, respecting, and, valuing, other, people, for, their, own, sake, rather, than, using, them, in, the, pursuit, of, personal, goals, in, either, case, kant, says, that, what, matters, is, to, have, a, good, will, a, person, has, a, good, will, if, they, respect, the, moral, law, and, form, their, intentions, and, motives, in, agreement, with, it, kant, states, that, actions, motivated, in, such, a, way, are, unconditionally, good, meaning, that, they, are, good, even, in, cases, where, they, result, in, undesirable, consequences, divine, command, theory, says, that, god, is, the, source, of, morality, it, states, that, moral, laws, are, divine, commands, and, that, to, act, morally, is, to, obey, and, follow, god, s, will, while, all, divine, command, theorists, agree, that, morality, depends, on, god, there, are, disagreements, about, the, precise, content, of, the, divine, commands, and, theorists, belonging, to, different, religions, tend, to, propose, different, moral, laws, for, example, christian, and, jewish, divine, command, theorists, may, argue, that, the, ten, commandments, express, god, s, will, while, muslims, may, reserve, this, role, for, the, teachings, of, the, quran, contractualists, reject, the, reference, to, god, as, the, source, of, morality, and, argue, instead, that, morality, is, based, on, an, explicit, or, implicit, social, contract, between, humans, they, state, that, actual, or, hypothetical, consent, to, this, contract, is, the, source, of, moral, norms, and, duties, to, determine, which, duties, people, have, contractualists, often, rely, on, a, thought, experiment, about, what, rational, people, under, ideal, circumstances, would, agree, on, for, example, if, they, would, agree, that, people, should, not, lie, then, there, is, a, moral, obligation, to, refrain, from, lying, because, it, relies, on, consent, contractualism, is, often, understood, as, a, patient, centered, form, of, deontology, famous, social, contract, theorists, include, thomas, hobbes, john, locke, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, john, rawls, discourse, ethics, also, focuses, on, social, agreement, on, moral, norms, but, says, that, this, agreement, is, based, on, communicative, rationality, it, aims, to, arrive, at, moral, norms, for, pluralistic, modern, societies, that, encompass, a, diversity, of, viewpoints, a, universal, moral, norm, is, seen, as, valid, if, all, rational, discourse, participants, do, or, would, approve, this, way, morality, is, not, imposed, by, a, single, moral, authority, but, arises, from, the, moral, discourse, within, society, this, discourse, should, aim, to, establish, an, ideal, speech, situation, to, ensure, fairness, and, inclusivity, in, particular, this, means, that, discourse, participants, are, free, to, voice, their, different, opinions, without, coercion, but, are, at, the, same, time, required, to, justify, them, using, rational, argumentation, the, main, concern, of, virtue, ethics, is, how, virtues, are, expressed, in, actions, as, such, it, is, neither, directly, interested, in, the, consequences, of, actions, nor, in, universal, moral, duties, virtues, are, positive, character, traits, like, honesty, courage, kindness, and, compassion, they, are, usually, understood, as, dispositions, to, feel, decide, and, act, in, a, certain, manner, by, being, wholeheartedly, committed, to, this, manner, virtues, contrast, with, vices, which, are, their, harmful, counterparts, virtue, theorists, usually, say, that, the, mere, possession, of, virtues, by, itself, is, not, sufficient, instead, people, should, manifest, virtues, in, their, actions, an, important, factor, is, the, practical, wisdom, also, called, phronesis, of, knowing, when, how, and, which, virtue, to, express, for, example, a, lack, of, practical, wisdom, may, lead, courageous, people, to, perform, morally, wrong, actions, by, taking, unnecessary, risks, that, should, better, be, avoided, different, types, of, virtue, ethics, differ, on, how, they, understand, virtues, and, their, role, in, practical, life, eudaimonism, is, the, original, form, of, virtue, theory, developed, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, and, draws, a, close, relation, between, virtuous, behavior, and, happiness, it, states, that, people, flourish, by, living, a, virtuous, life, eudaimonist, theories, often, hold, that, virtues, are, positive, potentials, residing, in, human, nature, and, that, actualizing, these, potentials, results, in, leading, a, good, and, happy, life, agent, based, theories, by, contrast, see, happiness, only, as, a, side, effect, and, focus, instead, on, the, admirable, traits, and, motivational, characteristics, expressed, while, acting, this, is, often, combined, with, the, idea, that, one, can, learn, from, exceptional, individuals, what, those, characteristics, are, feminist, ethics, of, care, are, another, form, of, virtue, ethics, they, emphasize, the, importance, of, interpersonal, relationships, and, say, that, benevolence, by, caring, for, the, well, being, of, others, is, one, of, the, key, virtues, influential, schools, of, virtue, ethics, in, ancient, philosophy, were, aristotelianism, and, stoicism, according, to, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, each, virtue, is, a, golden, mean, between, two, types, of, vices, excess, and, deficiency, for, example, courage, is, a, virtue, that, lies, between, the, deficient, state, of, cowardice, and, the, excessive, state, of, recklessness, aristotle, held, that, virtuous, action, leads, to, happiness, and, makes, people, flourish, in, life, stoicism, emerged, about, 300, bce, and, taught, that, through, virtue, alone, people, can, achieve, happiness, characterized, by, a, peaceful, state, of, mind, free, from, emotional, disturbances, the, stoics, advocated, rationality, and, self, mastery, to, achieve, this, state, in, the, 20th, century, virtue, ethics, experienced, a, resurgence, thanks, to, philosophers, such, as, elizabeth, anscombe, philippa, foot, alasdair, macintyre, and, martha, nussbaum, there, are, many, other, schools, of, normative, ethics, in, addition, to, the, three, main, traditions, pragmatist, ethics, focuses, on, the, role, of, practice, and, holds, that, one, of, the, key, tasks, of, ethics, is, to, solve, practical, problems, in, concrete, situations, it, has, certain, similarities, to, utilitarianism, and, its, focus, on, consequences, but, concentrates, more, on, how, morality, is, embedded, in, and, relative, to, social, and, cultural, contexts, pragmatists, tend, to, give, more, importance, to, habits, than, to, conscious, deliberation, and, understand, morality, as, a, habit, that, should, be, shaped, in, the, right, way, postmodern, ethics, agrees, with, pragmatist, ethics, about, the, cultural, relativity, of, morality, it, rejects, the, idea, that, there, are, objective, moral, principles, that, apply, universally, to, all, cultures, and, traditions, it, asserts, that, there, is, no, one, coherent, ethical, code, since, morality, itself, is, irrational, and, humans, are, morally, ambivalent, beings, postmodern, ethics, instead, focuses, on, how, moral, demands, arise, in, specific, situations, as, one, encounters, other, people, ethical, egoism, is, the, view, that, people, should, act, in, their, self, interest, or, that, an, action, is, morally, right, if, the, person, acts, for, their, own, benefit, it, differs, from, psychological, egoism, which, states, that, people, actually, follow, their, self, interest, without, claiming, that, they, should, do, so, ethical, egoists, may, act, in, agreement, with, commonly, accepted, moral, expectations, and, benefit, other, people, for, example, by, keeping, promises, helping, friends, and, cooperating, with, others, however, they, do, so, only, as, a, means, to, promote, their, self, interest, ethical, egoism, is, often, criticized, as, an, immoral, and, contradictory, position, normative, ethics, has, a, central, place, in, most, religions, key, aspects, of, jewish, ethics, are, to, follow, the, 613, commandments, of, god, according, to, the, mitzvah, duty, found, in, the, torah, and, to, take, responsibility, for, societal, welfare, christian, ethics, puts, less, emphasis, on, following, precise, laws, and, teaches, instead, the, practice, of, selfless, love, such, as, the, great, commandment, to, love, your, neighbor, as, yourself, the, five, pillars, of, islam, constitute, a, basic, framework, of, muslim, ethics, and, focus, on, the, practice, of, faith, prayer, charity, fasting, during, ramadan, and, pilgrimage, to, mecca, buddhists, emphasize, the, importance, of, compassion, and, loving, kindness, towards, all, sentient, entities, a, similar, outlook, is, found, in, jainism, which, has, non, violence, as, its, principal, virtue, duty, is, a, central, aspect, of, hindu, ethics, and, is, about, fulfilling, social, obligations, which, may, vary, depending, on, a, person, s, social, class, and, stage, of, life, confucianism, places, great, emphasis, on, harmony, in, society, and, sees, benevolence, as, a, key, virtue, taoism, extends, the, importance, of, living, in, harmony, to, the, whole, world, and, teaches, that, people, should, practice, effortless, action, by, following, the, natural, flow, of, the, universe, indigenous, belief, systems, like, native, american, philosophy, and, the, african, ubuntu, philosophy, often, emphasize, the, interconnectedness, of, all, living, beings, and, the, environment, while, stressing, the, importance, of, living, in, harmony, with, nature, metaethics, is, the, branch, of, ethics, that, examines, the, nature, foundations, and, scope, of, moral, judgments, concepts, and, values, it, is, not, interested, in, which, actions, are, right, but, in, what, it, means, for, an, action, to, be, right, and, whether, moral, judgments, are, objective, and, can, be, true, at, all, it, further, examines, the, meaning, of, morality, and, other, moral, terms, metaethics, is, a, metatheory, that, operates, on, a, higher, level, of, abstraction, than, normative, ethics, by, investigating, its, underlying, assumptions, metaethical, theories, typically, do, not, directly, judge, which, normative, ethical, theories, are, correct, however, metaethical, theories, can, still, influence, normative, theories, by, examining, their, foundational, principles, metaethics, overlaps, with, various, branches, of, philosophy, on, the, level, of, ontology, it, examines, whether, there, are, objective, moral, facts, concerning, semantics, it, asks, what, the, meaning, of, moral, terms, are, and, whether, moral, statements, have, a, truth, value, the, epistemological, side, of, metaethics, discusses, whether, and, how, people, can, acquire, moral, knowledge, metaethics, overlaps, with, psychology, because, of, its, interest, in, how, moral, judgments, motivate, people, to, act, it, also, overlaps, with, anthropology, since, it, aims, to, explain, how, cross, cultural, differences, affect, moral, assessments, metaethics, examines, basic, ethical, concepts, and, their, relations, ethics, is, primarily, concerned, with, normative, statements, about, what, ought, to, be, the, case, in, contrast, to, descriptive, statements, which, are, about, what, is, the, case, duties, and, obligations, express, requirements, of, what, people, ought, to, do, duties, are, sometimes, defined, as, counterparts, of, the, rights, that, always, accompany, them, according, to, this, view, someone, has, a, duty, to, benefit, another, person, if, this, other, person, has, the, right, to, receive, that, benefit, obligation, and, permission, are, contrasting, terms, that, can, be, defined, through, each, other, to, be, obligated, to, do, something, means, that, one, is, not, permitted, not, to, do, it, and, to, be, permitted, to, do, something, means, that, one, is, not, obligated, not, to, do, it, some, theorists, define, obligations, in, terms, of, values, or, what, is, good, when, used, in, a, general, sense, good, contrasts, with, bad, when, describing, people, and, their, intentions, the, term, evil, rather, than, bad, is, often, employed, obligations, are, used, to, assess, the, moral, status, of, actions, motives, and, character, traits, an, action, is, morally, right, if, it, is, in, tune, with, a, person, s, obligations, and, morally, wrong, if, it, violates, them, supererogation, is, a, special, moral, status, that, applies, to, cases, in, which, the, agent, does, more, than, is, morally, required, of, them, to, be, morally, responsible, for, an, action, usually, means, that, the, person, possesses, and, exercises, certain, capacities, or, some, form, of, control, if, a, person, is, morally, responsible, then, it, is, appropriate, to, respond, to, them, in, certain, ways, for, example, by, praising, or, blaming, them, a, major, debate, in, metaethics, is, about, the, ontological, status, of, morality, questioning, whether, ethical, values, and, principles, are, real, it, examines, whether, moral, properties, exist, as, objective, features, independent, of, the, human, mind, and, culture, rather, than, as, subjective, constructs, or, expressions, of, personal, preferences, and, cultural, norms, moral, realists, accept, the, claim, that, there, are, objective, moral, facts, this, view, implies, that, moral, values, are, mind, independent, aspects, of, reality, and, that, there, is, an, absolute, fact, about, whether, a, given, action, is, right, or, wrong, a, consequence, of, this, view, is, that, moral, requirements, have, the, same, ontological, status, as, non, moral, facts, it, is, an, objective, fact, whether, there, is, an, obligation, to, keep, a, promise, just, as, it, is, an, objective, fact, whether, a, thing, is, rectangular, moral, realism, is, often, associated, with, the, claim, that, there, are, universal, ethical, principles, that, apply, equally, to, everyone, it, implies, that, if, two, people, disagree, about, a, moral, evaluation, then, at, least, one, of, them, is, wrong, this, observation, is, sometimes, taken, as, an, argument, against, moral, realism, since, moral, disagreement, is, widespread, in, most, fields, moral, relativists, reject, the, idea, that, morality, is, an, objective, feature, of, reality, they, argue, instead, that, moral, principles, are, human, inventions, this, means, that, a, behavior, is, not, objectively, right, or, wrong, but, only, subjectively, right, or, wrong, relative, to, a, certain, standpoint, moral, standpoints, may, differ, between, persons, cultures, and, historical, periods, for, example, moral, statements, like, slavery, is, wrong, or, suicide, is, permissible, may, be, true, in, one, culture, and, false, in, another, some, moral, relativists, say, that, moral, systems, are, constructed, to, serve, certain, goals, such, as, social, coordination, according, to, this, view, different, societies, and, different, social, groups, within, a, society, construct, different, moral, systems, based, on, their, diverging, purposes, emotivism, provides, a, different, explanation, stating, that, morality, arises, from, moral, emotions, which, are, not, the, same, for, everyone, moral, nihilists, deny, the, existence, of, moral, facts, they, reject, the, existence, of, both, objective, moral, facts, defended, by, moral, realism, and, subjective, moral, facts, defended, by, moral, relativism, they, believe, that, the, basic, assumptions, underlying, moral, claims, are, misguided, some, moral, nihilists, conclude, from, this, that, anything, is, allowed, a, slightly, different, view, emphasizes, that, moral, nihilism, is, not, itself, a, moral, position, about, what, is, allowed, and, prohibited, but, the, rejection, of, any, moral, position, moral, nihilism, like, moral, relativism, recognizes, that, people, judge, actions, as, right, or, wrong, from, different, perspectives, however, it, disagrees, that, this, practice, involves, morality, and, sees, it, as, just, one, type, of, human, behavior, a, central, disagreement, among, moral, realists, is, between, naturalism, and, non, naturalism, naturalism, states, that, moral, properties, are, natural, properties, accessible, to, empirical, observation, they, are, similar, to, the, natural, properties, investigated, by, the, natural, sciences, like, color, and, shape, some, moral, naturalists, hold, that, moral, properties, are, a, unique, and, basic, type, of, natural, property, another, view, states, that, moral, properties, are, real, but, not, a, fundamental, part, of, reality, and, can, be, reduced, to, other, natural, properties, such, as, properties, describing, the, causes, of, pleasure, and, pain, non, naturalism, argues, that, moral, properties, form, part, of, reality, and, argues, that, moral, features, are, not, identical, or, reducible, to, natural, properties, this, view, is, usually, motivated, by, the, idea, that, moral, properties, are, unique, because, they, express, what, should, be, the, case, proponents, of, this, position, often, emphasize, this, uniqueness, by, claiming, that, it, is, a, fallacy, to, define, ethics, in, terms, of, natural, entities, or, to, infer, prescriptive, from, descriptive, statements, the, metaethical, debate, between, cognitivism, and, non, cognitivism, is, about, the, meaning, of, moral, statements, and, is, a, part, of, the, study, of, semantics, according, to, cognitivism, moral, statements, like, abortion, is, morally, wrong, and, going, to, war, is, never, morally, justified, are, truth, apt, meaning, that, they, all, have, a, truth, value, they, are, either, true, or, false, cognitivism, claims, that, moral, statements, have, a, truth, value, but, is, not, interested, in, which, truth, value, they, have, it, is, often, seen, as, the, default, position, since, moral, statements, resemble, other, statements, like, abortion, is, a, medical, procedure, or, going, to, war, is, a, political, decision, which, have, a, truth, value, there, is, a, close, relation, between, the, semantic, theory, of, cognitivism, and, the, ontological, theory, of, moral, realism, moral, realists, assert, that, moral, facts, exist, this, can, be, used, to, explain, why, moral, statements, are, true, or, false, a, statement, is, true, if, it, is, consistent, with, the, facts, and, false, otherwise, as, a, result, philosophers, who, accept, one, theory, often, accept, the, other, as, well, an, exception, is, error, theory, which, combines, cognitivism, with, moral, nihilism, by, claiming, that, all, moral, statements, are, false, because, there, are, no, moral, facts, non, cognitivism, is, the, view, that, moral, statements, lack, a, truth, value, according, to, this, view, the, statement, murder, is, wrong, is, neither, true, nor, false, some, non, cognitivists, claim, that, moral, statements, have, no, meaning, at, all, a, different, interpretation, is, that, they, have, another, type, of, meaning, emotivism, says, that, they, articulate, emotional, attitudes, according, to, this, view, the, statement, murder, is, wrong, expresses, that, the, speaker, has, a, negative, moral, attitude, towards, murder, or, disapproves, of, it, prescriptivism, by, contrast, understands, moral, statements, as, commands, according, to, this, view, stating, that, murder, is, wrong, expresses, a, command, like, do, not, commit, murder, the, epistemology, of, ethics, studies, whether, or, how, one, can, know, moral, truths, foundationalist, views, state, that, some, moral, beliefs, are, basic, and, do, not, require, further, justification, ethical, intuitionism, is, one, such, view, that, says, that, humans, have, a, special, cognitive, faculty, through, which, they, can, know, right, from, wrong, intuitionists, often, argue, that, general, moral, truths, like, lying, is, wrong, are, self, evident, and, that, it, is, possible, to, know, them, without, relying, on, empirical, experience, a, different, foundationalist, position, focuses, on, particular, observations, rather, than, general, intuitions, it, says, that, if, people, are, confronted, with, a, concrete, moral, situation, they, can, perceive, whether, right, or, wrong, conduct, was, involved, in, contrast, to, foundationalists, coherentists, say, that, there, are, no, basic, moral, beliefs, they, argue, that, beliefs, form, a, complex, network, and, mutually, support, and, justify, one, another, according, to, this, view, a, moral, belief, can, only, amount, to, knowledge, if, it, coheres, with, the, rest, of, the, beliefs, in, the, network, moral, skeptics, say, that, people, are, unable, to, distinguish, between, right, and, wrong, behavior, thereby, rejecting, the, idea, that, moral, knowledge, is, possible, a, common, objection, by, critics, of, moral, skepticism, asserts, that, it, leads, to, immoral, behavior, thought, experiments, are, used, as, a, method, in, ethics, to, decide, between, competing, theories, they, usually, present, an, imagined, situation, involving, an, ethical, dilemma, and, explore, how, people, s, intuitions, of, right, and, wrong, change, based, on, specific, details, in, that, situation, for, example, in, philippa, foot, s, trolley, problem, a, person, can, flip, a, switch, to, redirect, a, trolley, from, one, track, to, another, thereby, sacrificing, the, life, of, one, person, to, save, five, this, scenario, explores, how, the, difference, between, doing, and, allowing, harm, affects, moral, obligations, another, thought, experiment, proposed, by, judith, jarvis, thomson, examines, the, moral, implications, of, abortion, by, imagining, a, situation, in, which, a, person, gets, connected, without, their, consent, to, an, ill, violinist, in, this, scenario, the, violinist, dies, if, the, connection, is, severed, similar, to, how, a, fetus, dies, in, the, case, of, abortion, the, thought, experiment, explores, whether, it, would, be, morally, permissible, to, sever, the, connection, within, the, next, nine, months, on, the, level, of, psychology, metaethics, is, interested, in, how, moral, beliefs, and, experiences, affect, behavior, according, to, motivational, internalists, there, is, a, direct, link, between, moral, judgments, and, action, this, means, that, every, judgment, about, what, is, right, motivates, the, person, to, act, accordingly, for, example, socrates, defends, a, strong, form, of, motivational, internalism, by, holding, that, a, person, can, only, perform, an, evil, deed, if, they, are, unaware, that, it, is, evil, weaker, forms, of, motivational, internalism, say, that, people, can, act, against, their, own, moral, judgments, for, example, because, of, the, weakness, of, the, will, motivational, externalists, accept, that, people, can, judge, an, act, to, be, morally, required, without, feeling, a, reason, to, engage, in, it, this, means, that, moral, judgments, do, not, always, provide, motivational, force, a, closely, related, question, is, whether, moral, judgments, can, provide, motivation, on, their, own, or, need, to, be, accompanied, by, other, mental, states, such, as, a, desire, to, act, morally, applied, ethics, also, known, as, practical, ethics, is, the, branch, of, ethics, and, applied, philosophy, that, examines, concrete, moral, problems, encountered, in, real, life, situations, unlike, normative, ethics, it, is, not, concerned, with, discovering, or, justifying, universal, ethical, principles, instead, it, studies, how, those, principles, can, be, applied, to, specific, domains, of, practical, life, what, consequences, they, have, in, these, fields, and, whether, additional, domain, specific, factors, need, to, be, considered, one, of, the, main, challenges, of, applied, ethics, is, to, breach, the, gap, between, abstract, universal, theories, and, their, application, to, concrete, situations, for, example, an, in, depth, understanding, of, kantianism, or, utilitarianism, is, usually, not, sufficient, to, decide, how, to, analyze, the, moral, implications, of, a, medical, procedure, like, abortion, one, reason, is, that, it, may, not, be, clear, how, the, kantian, requirement, of, respecting, everyone, s, personhood, applies, to, a, fetus, or, from, a, utilitarian, perspective, what, the, long, term, consequences, are, in, terms, of, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, this, difficulty, is, particularly, relevant, to, applied, ethicists, who, employ, a, top, down, methodology, by, starting, from, universal, ethical, principles, and, applying, them, to, particular, cases, within, a, specific, domain, a, different, approach, is, to, use, a, bottom, up, methodology, known, as, casuistry, this, method, does, not, start, from, universal, principles, but, from, moral, intuitions, about, particular, cases, it, seeks, to, arrive, at, moral, principles, relevant, to, a, specific, domain, which, may, not, be, applicable, to, other, domains, in, either, case, inquiry, into, applied, ethics, is, often, triggered, by, ethical, dilemmas, in, which, a, person, is, subject, to, conflicting, moral, requirements, applied, ethics, covers, issues, belonging, to, both, the, private, sphere, like, right, conduct, in, the, family, and, close, relationships, and, the, public, sphere, like, moral, problems, posed, by, new, technologies, and, duties, toward, future, generations, major, branches, include, bioethics, business, ethics, and, professional, ethics, there, are, many, other, branches, and, their, domains, of, inquiry, often, overlap, bioethics, covers, moral, problems, associated, with, living, organisms, and, biological, disciplines, a, key, problem, in, bioethics, is, how, features, such, as, consciousness, being, able, to, feel, pleasure, and, pain, rationality, and, personhood, affect, the, moral, status, of, entities, these, differences, concern, for, example, how, to, treat, non, living, entities, like, rocks, and, non, sentient, entities, like, plants, in, contrast, to, animals, and, whether, humans, have, a, different, moral, status, than, other, animals, according, to, anthropocentrism, only, humans, have, a, basic, moral, status, this, suggests, that, all, other, entities, possess, a, derivative, moral, status, only, insofar, as, they, impact, human, life, sentientism, by, contrast, extends, an, inherent, moral, status, to, all, sentient, beings, further, positions, include, biocentrism, which, also, covers, non, sentient, lifeforms, and, ecocentrism, which, states, that, all, of, nature, has, a, basic, moral, status, bioethics, is, relevant, to, various, aspects, of, life, and, many, professions, it, covers, a, wide, range, of, moral, problems, associated, with, topics, like, abortion, cloning, stem, cell, research, euthanasia, suicide, animal, testing, intensive, animal, farming, nuclear, waste, and, air, pollution, bioethics, can, be, divided, into, medical, ethics, animal, ethics, and, environmental, ethics, based, on, whether, the, ethical, problems, relate, to, humans, other, animals, or, nature, in, general, medical, ethics, is, the, oldest, branch, of, bioethics, the, hippocratic, oath, is, one, of, the, earliest, texts, to, engage, in, medical, ethics, by, establishes, ethical, guidelines, for, medical, practitioners, like, a, prohibition, to, harm, the, patient, medical, ethics, often, addresses, issues, related, to, the, start, and, end, of, life, it, examines, the, moral, status, of, fetuses, for, example, whether, they, are, full, fledged, persons, and, whether, abortion, is, a, form, of, murder, ethical, issues, also, arise, about, whether, a, person, has, the, right, to, end, their, life, in, cases, of, terminal, illness, or, chronic, suffering, and, if, doctors, may, help, them, do, so, other, topics, in, medical, ethics, include, medical, confidentiality, informed, consent, research, on, human, beings, organ, transplantation, and, access, to, healthcare, animal, ethics, examines, how, humans, should, treat, other, animals, this, field, often, emphasizes, the, importance, of, animal, welfare, while, arguing, that, humans, should, avoid, or, minimize, the, harm, done, to, animals, there, is, wide, agreement, that, it, is, wrong, to, torture, animals, for, fun, the, situation, is, more, complicated, in, cases, where, harm, is, inflicted, on, animals, as, a, side, effect, of, the, pursuit, of, human, interests, this, happens, for, example, during, factory, farming, when, using, animals, as, food, and, for, research, experiments, on, animals, a, key, topic, in, animal, ethics, is, the, formulation, of, animal, rights, animal, rights, theorists, assert, that, animals, have, a, certain, moral, status, and, that, humans, should, respect, this, status, when, interacting, with, them, examples, of, suggested, animal, rights, include, the, right, to, life, the, right, to, be, free, from, unnecessary, suffering, and, the, right, to, natural, behavior, in, a, suitable, environment, environmental, ethics, deals, with, moral, problems, relating, to, the, natural, environment, including, animals, plants, natural, resources, and, ecosystems, in, its, widest, sense, it, covers, the, whole, cosmos, in, the, domain, of, agriculture, this, concerns, the, circumstances, under, which, the, vegetation, of, an, area, may, be, cleared, to, use, it, for, farming, and, the, implications, of, planting, genetically, modified, crops, on, a, wider, scale, environmental, ethics, addresses, the, problem, of, global, warming, and, people, s, responsibility, on, the, individual, and, collective, levels, including, topics, like, climate, justice, and, duties, towards, future, generations, environmental, ethicists, often, promote, sustainable, practices, and, policies, directed, at, protecting, and, conserving, ecosystems, and, biodiversity, business, ethics, examines, the, moral, implications, of, business, conduct, and, how, ethical, principles, apply, to, corporations, and, organizations, a, key, topic, is, corporate, social, responsibility, which, is, the, responsibility, of, corporations, to, act, in, a, manner, that, benefits, society, at, large, corporate, social, responsibility, is, a, complex, issue, since, many, stakeholders, are, directly, and, indirectly, involved, in, corporate, decisions, such, as, the, ceo, the, board, of, directors, and, the, shareholders, a, closely, related, topic, is, the, question, of, whether, corporations, themselves, and, not, just, their, stakeholders, have, moral, agency, business, ethics, further, examines, the, role, of, honesty, and, fairness, in, business, practices, as, well, as, the, moral, implications, of, bribery, conflict, of, interest, protection, of, investors, and, consumers, worker, s, rights, ethical, leadership, and, corporate, philanthropy, professional, ethics, is, a, closely, related, field, that, studies, ethical, principles, applying, to, members, of, a, specific, profession, like, engineers, medical, doctors, lawyers, and, teachers, it, is, a, diverse, field, since, different, professions, often, have, different, responsibilities, principles, applying, to, many, professions, include, that, the, professional, has, the, required, expertise, for, the, intended, work, and, that, they, have, personal, integrity, and, are, trustworthy, further, principles, are, to, serve, the, interest, of, their, target, group, follow, client, confidentiality, and, respect, and, uphold, the, client, s, rights, such, as, informed, consent, more, precise, requirements, often, vary, between, professions, a, cornerstone, of, engineering, ethics, is, to, protect, public, safety, health, and, well, being, legal, ethics, emphasizes, the, importance, of, respect, for, justice, personal, integrity, and, confidentiality, key, factors, in, journalism, ethics, include, accuracy, truthfulness, independence, and, impartiality, as, well, as, proper, attribution, to, avoid, plagiarism, many, other, fields, of, applied, ethics, are, discussed, in, the, academic, literature, communication, ethics, covers, moral, principles, of, communicative, conduct, two, key, issues, in, it, are, freedom, of, speech, and, speech, responsibility, freedom, of, speech, concerns, the, ability, to, articulate, one, s, opinions, and, ideas, without, the, threats, of, punishment, and, censorship, speech, responsibility, is, about, being, accountable, for, the, consequences, of, communicative, action, and, inaction, a, closely, related, field, is, information, ethics, which, focuses, on, the, moral, implications, of, creating, controlling, disseminating, and, using, information, the, ethics, of, technology, examines, the, moral, issues, associated, with, the, creation, and, use, of, any, artifact, from, simple, spears, to, high, tech, computers, and, nanotechnology, central, topics, in, the, ethics, of, technology, include, the, risks, associated, with, creating, new, technologies, their, responsible, use, and, questions, about, human, enhancement, through, technological, means, such, as, performance, enhancing, drugs, and, genetic, enhancement, important, subfields, include, computer, ethics, ethics, of, artificial, intelligence, machine, ethics, ethics, of, nanotechnology, and, nuclear, ethics, the, ethics, of, war, investigates, moral, problems, of, war, and, violent, conflicts, according, to, just, war, theory, waging, war, is, morally, justified, if, it, fulfills, certain, conditions, these, conditions, are, commonly, divided, into, requirements, concerning, the, cause, to, initiate, violent, activities, such, as, self, defense, and, the, way, those, violent, activities, are, conducted, such, as, avoiding, excessive, harm, to, civilians, in, the, pursuit, of, legitimate, military, targets, military, ethics, is, a, closely, related, field, that, is, interested, in, the, conduct, of, military, personnel, it, governs, questions, of, the, circumstances, under, which, they, are, permitted, to, kill, enemies, destroy, infrastructure, and, put, the, lives, of, their, own, troops, at, risk, additional, topics, are, the, recruitment, training, and, discharge, of, military, personnel, further, fields, of, applied, ethics, include, political, ethics, which, examines, the, moral, dimensions, of, political, decisions, educational, ethics, which, covers, ethical, issues, related, to, proper, teaching, practices, and, sexual, ethics, which, addresses, the, moral, implications, of, sexual, behavior, value, theory, also, called, axiology, is, the, philosophical, study, of, value, it, examines, the, nature, and, types, of, value, a, central, distinction, is, between, intrinsic, and, instrumental, value, an, entity, has, intrinsic, value, if, it, is, good, in, itself, or, good, for, its, own, sake, an, entity, has, instrumental, value, if, it, is, valuable, as, a, means, to, something, else, for, example, by, causing, something, that, has, intrinsic, value, further, topics, include, what, kinds, of, things, have, value, and, how, valuable, they, are, for, instance, axiological, hedonists, say, that, pleasure, is, the, only, source, of, intrinsic, value, and, that, the, magnitude, of, value, corresponds, to, the, degree, of, pleasure, axiological, pluralists, by, contrast, hold, that, there, are, different, sources, of, intrinsic, value, such, as, happiness, knowledge, and, beauty, there, are, disagreements, about, the, exact, relation, between, value, theory, and, ethics, some, philosophers, characterize, value, theory, as, a, subdiscipline, of, ethics, while, others, see, value, theory, as, the, broader, term, that, encompasses, other, fields, besides, ethics, such, as, aesthetics, and, political, philosophy, a, different, characterization, sees, the, two, disciplines, as, overlapping, but, distinct, fields, the, term, axiological, ethics, is, sometimes, used, for, the, discipline, studying, this, overlap, that, is, the, part, of, ethics, that, studies, values, the, two, disciplines, are, sometimes, distinguished, based, on, their, focus, ethics, is, about, moral, behavior, or, what, is, right, while, value, theory, is, about, value, or, what, is, good, some, ethical, theories, like, consequentialism, stand, very, close, to, value, theory, by, defining, what, is, right, in, terms, of, what, is, good, but, this, is, not, true, for, ethics, in, general, and, deontological, theories, tend, to, reject, the, idea, that, what, is, good, can, be, used, to, define, what, is, right, moral, psychology, explores, the, psychological, foundations, and, processes, involved, in, moral, behavior, it, is, an, empirical, science, that, studies, how, humans, think, and, act, in, moral, contexts, it, is, interested, in, how, moral, reasoning, and, judgments, take, place, how, moral, character, forms, what, sensitivity, people, have, to, moral, evaluations, and, how, people, attribute, and, react, to, moral, responsibility, one, of, its, key, topics, is, moral, development, or, the, question, of, how, morality, develops, on, a, psychological, level, from, infancy, to, adulthood, according, to, lawrence, kohlberg, children, go, through, different, stages, of, moral, development, as, they, understand, moral, principles, first, as, fixed, rules, governing, reward, and, punishment, then, as, conventional, social, norms, and, later, as, abstract, principles, of, what, is, objectively, right, across, societies, a, closely, related, question, is, whether, and, how, people, can, be, taught, to, act, morally, evolutionary, ethics, a, closely, related, field, explores, how, evolutionary, processes, have, shaped, ethics, one, of, its, key, ideas, is, that, natural, selection, is, responsible, for, moral, behavior, and, moral, sensitivity, it, interprets, morality, as, an, adaptation, to, evolutionary, pressure, that, augments, fitness, by, offering, a, selective, advantage, altruism, for, example, can, provide, benefits, to, group, survival, by, improving, cooperation, some, theorists, like, mark, rowlands, argue, that, morality, is, not, limited, to, humans, meaning, that, some, non, human, animals, act, based, on, moral, emotions, others, explore, evolutionary, precursors, to, morality, in, non, human, animals, descriptive, ethics, also, called, comparative, ethics, studies, existing, moral, codes, practices, and, beliefs, it, investigates, and, compares, moral, phenomena, in, different, societies, and, different, groups, within, a, society, it, aims, to, provide, a, value, neutral, and, empirical, description, without, judging, or, justifying, which, practices, are, objectively, right, for, instance, the, question, of, how, nurses, think, about, the, ethical, implications, of, abortion, belongs, to, descriptive, ethics, another, example, is, descriptive, business, ethics, which, describes, ethical, standards, in, the, context, of, business, including, common, practices, official, policies, and, employee, opinions, descriptive, ethics, also, has, a, historical, dimension, by, exploring, how, moral, practices, and, beliefs, have, changed, over, time, descriptive, ethics, is, a, multidisciplinary, field, that, is, covered, by, disciplines, such, as, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and, history, its, empirical, outlook, contrasts, with, the, philosophical, inquiry, into, normative, questions, such, as, which, ethical, principles, are, correct, and, how, to, justify, them, the, history, of, ethics, studies, how, moral, philosophy, has, developed, and, evolved, in, the, course, of, history, it, has, its, origin, in, ancient, civilizations, in, ancient, egypt, the, concept, of, maat, was, used, as, an, ethical, principle, to, guide, behavior, and, maintain, order, by, emphasizing, the, importance, of, truth, balance, and, harmony, in, ancient, india, starting, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, the, vedas, and, later, upanishads, were, composed, as, the, foundational, texts, of, hindu, philosophy, and, discussed, the, role, of, duty, and, the, consequences, of, one, s, actions, buddhist, ethics, originated, in, ancient, india, between, the, sixth, and, the, fifth, centuries, bce, and, advocated, compassion, non, violence, and, the, pursuit, of, enlightenment, ancient, china, in, the, 6th, century, bce, saw, the, emergence, of, confucianism, which, focuses, on, moral, conduct, and, self, cultivation, by, acting, in, agreement, with, virtues, and, daoism, which, teaches, that, human, behavior, should, be, in, harmony, with, the, natural, order, of, the, universe, in, ancient, greece, socrates, c, 469, 399, bce, emphasized, the, importance, of, inquiry, into, what, a, good, life, is, by, critically, questioning, established, ideas, and, exploring, concepts, like, virtue, justice, courage, and, wisdom, according, to, plato, c, 428, 347, bce, to, lead, a, good, life, means, that, the, different, parts, of, the, soul, are, in, harmony, with, each, other, for, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, a, good, life, is, associated, with, being, happy, by, cultivating, virtues, and, flourishing, starting, in, the, 4th, century, bce, the, close, relation, between, right, action, and, happiness, was, also, explored, by, the, hellenistic, schools, of, epicureanism, which, recommended, a, simple, lifestyle, without, indulging, in, sensory, pleasures, and, stoicism, which, advocated, living, in, tune, with, reason, and, virtue, while, practicing, self, mastery, and, becoming, immune, to, disturbing, emotions, ethical, thought, in, the, medieval, period, was, strongly, influenced, by, religious, teachings, christian, philosophers, interpreted, moral, principles, as, divine, commands, originating, from, god, thomas, aquinas, 1224, 1274, ce, developed, natural, law, ethics, by, claiming, that, ethical, behavior, consists, in, following, the, laws, and, order, of, nature, which, he, believed, were, created, by, god, in, the, islamic, world, philosophers, like, al, farabi, c, 878, 950, ce, and, avicenna, 980, 1037, ce, synthesized, ancient, greek, philosophy, with, the, ethical, teachings, of, islam, while, emphasizing, the, harmony, between, reason, and, faith, in, medieval, india, hindu, philosophers, like, adi, shankara, c, 700, 750, ce, and, ramanuja, 1017, 1137, ce, saw, the, practice, of, spirituality, to, attain, liberation, as, the, highest, goal, of, human, behavior, moral, philosophy, in, the, modern, period, was, characterized, by, a, shift, toward, a, secular, approach, to, ethics, thomas, hobbes, 1588, 1679, identified, self, interest, as, the, primary, drive, of, humans, he, concluded, that, it, would, lead, to, a, war, of, every, man, against, every, man, unless, a, social, contract, is, established, to, avoid, this, outcome, david, hume, 1711, 1776, thought, that, only, moral, sentiments, like, empathy, can, motivate, ethical, actions, while, he, saw, reason, not, as, a, motivating, factor, but, only, as, what, anticipates, the, consequences, of, possible, actions, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, by, contrast, saw, reason, as, the, source, of, morality, he, formulated, a, deontological, theory, according, to, which, the, ethical, value, of, actions, depends, on, their, conformity, with, moral, laws, independent, of, their, outcome, these, laws, take, the, form, of, categorical, imperatives, which, are, universal, requirements, that, apply, to, every, situation, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, saw, kant, s, categorical, imperative, on, its, own, as, an, empty, formalism, and, emphasized, the, role, of, social, institutions, in, providing, concrete, content, to, moral, duties, according, to, the, christian, philosophy, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, 1813, 1855, the, demands, of, ethical, duties, are, sometimes, suspended, when, doing, god, s, will, friedrich, nietzsche, 1844, 1900, formulated, criticisms, of, both, christian, and, kantian, morality, another, influential, development, in, this, period, was, the, formulation, of, utilitarianism, by, jeremy, bentham, 1748, 1832, and, john, stuart, mill, 1806, 1873, according, to, the, utilitarian, doctrine, actions, should, promote, happiness, while, reducing, suffering, and, the, right, action, is, the, one, that, produces, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, of, people, an, important, development, in, 20th, century, ethics, in, analytic, philosophy, was, the, emergence, of, metaethics, significant, early, contributions, to, this, field, were, made, by, g, e, moore, 1873, 1958, who, argued, that, moral, values, are, essentially, different, from, other, properties, found, in, the, natural, world, r, m, hare, 1919, 2002, followed, this, idea, in, formulating, his, prescriptivism, which, states, that, moral, statements, are, commands, that, unlike, regular, judgments, are, neither, true, nor, false, j, l, mackie, 1917, 1981, suggested, that, every, moral, statement, is, false, since, there, are, no, moral, facts, an, influential, argument, for, moral, realism, was, made, by, derek, parfit, 1942, 2017, who, argued, that, morality, concerns, objective, features, of, reality, that, give, people, reasons, to, act, in, one, way, or, another, bernard, williams, 1929, 2003, agreed, with, the, close, relation, between, reasons, and, ethics, but, defended, a, subjective, view, instead, that, sees, reasons, as, internal, mental, states, that, may, or, may, not, reflect, external, reality, another, development, in, this, period, was, the, revival, of, ancient, virtue, ethics, by, philosophers, like, philippa, foot, 1920, 2010, in, the, field, of, political, philosophy, john, rawls, 1921, 2002, relied, on, kantian, ethics, to, analyze, social, justice, as, a, form, of, fairness, in, continental, philosophy, phenomenologists, such, as, max, scheler, 1874, 1928, and, nicolai, hartmann, 1882, 1950, built, ethical, systems, based, on, the, claim, that, values, have, objective, reality, that, can, be, investigated, using, the, phenomenological, method, existentialists, like, jean, paul, sartre, 1905, 1980, and, simone, de, beauvoir, 1908, 1986, by, contrast, held, that, values, are, created, by, humans, and, explored, the, consequences, of, this, view, in, relation, to, individual, freedom, responsibility, and, authenticity, this, period, also, saw, the, emergence, of, feminist, ethics, which, questions, traditional, ethical, assumptions, associated, with, a, male, perspective, and, puts, alternative, concepts, like, care, at, the, center
