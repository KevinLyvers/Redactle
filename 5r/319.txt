modern, paganism, also, known, as, contemporary, paganism, and, neopaganism, spans, a, range, of, new, religious, movements, variously, influenced, by, the, beliefs, of, pre, modern, peoples, across, europe, north, africa, and, the, near, east, despite, some, common, similarities, contemporary, pagan, movements, are, diverse, sharing, no, single, set, of, beliefs, practices, or, religious, texts, scholars, of, religion, may, study, the, phenomenon, as, a, movement, divided, into, different, religions, while, others, study, neopaganism, as, a, decentralized, religion, with, an, array, of, denominations, adherents, rely, on, pre, christian, folkloric, and, ethnographic, sources, to, a, variety, of, degrees, many, of, them, follow, a, spirituality, that, they, accept, as, entirely, modern, while, others, claim, to, adhere, to, prehistoric, beliefs, or, else, they, attempt, to, revive, indigenous, religions, as, accurately, as, possible, modern, pagan, movements, are, frequently, described, on, a, spectrum, ranging, from, reconstructive, which, seeks, to, revive, historical, pagan, religions, to, eclectic, movements, which, blend, elements, from, various, religions, and, philosophies, with, historical, paganism, polytheism, animism, and, pantheism, are, common, features, across, pagan, theology, modern, pagans, can, also, include, atheists, upholding, virtues, and, principles, associated, with, paganism, while, maintaining, a, secular, worldview, humanistic, naturalistic, or, secular, pagans, may, recognize, deities, as, archetypes, or, useful, metaphors, for, different, cycles, of, life, or, reframe, magic, as, a, purely, psychological, practice, contemporary, paganism, has, been, associated, with, the, new, age, movement, with, scholars, highlighting, their, similarities, as, well, as, their, differences, the, academic, field, of, pagan, studies, began, to, coalesce, in, the, 1990s, emerging, from, disparate, scholarship, in, the, preceding, two, decades, there, is, considerable, disagreement, as, to, the, precise, definition, and, the, proper, usage, of, the, term, modern, paganism, even, within, the, academic, field, of, pagan, studies, there, is, no, consensus, about, how, contemporary, paganism, can, best, be, defined, most, scholars, describe, modern, paganism, as, a, broad, array, of, different, religions, not, a, single, one, the, category, of, modern, paganism, could, be, compared, to, the, categories, of, abrahamic, religions, and, indian, religions, in, its, structure, a, second, less, common, definition, found, within, pagan, studies, promoted, by, the, religious, studies, scholars, michael, f, strmiska, and, graham, harvey, characterises, modern, paganism, as, a, single, religion, of, which, groups, like, wicca, druidry, and, heathenry, are, denominations, this, perspective, has, been, critiqued, given, the, lack, of, core, commonalities, in, issues, such, as, theology, cosmology, ethics, afterlife, holy, days, or, ritual, practices, within, the, pagan, movement, contemporary, paganism, has, been, defined, as, a, collection, of, modern, religious, spiritual, and, magical, traditions, that, are, self, consciously, inspired, by, the, pre, judaic, pre, christian, and, pre, islamic, belief, systems, of, europe, north, africa, and, the, near, east, thus, it, has, been, said, that, although, it, is, a, highly, diverse, phenomenon, an, identifiable, common, element, nevertheless, runs, through, the, pagan, movement, strmiska, described, paganism, as, a, movement, dedicated, to, reviving, the, polytheistic, nature, worshipping, pagan, religions, of, pre, christian, europe, and, adapting, them, for, the, use, of, people, in, modern, societies, the, religious, studies, scholar, wouter, hanegraaff, characterised, paganism, as, encompassing, all, those, modern, movements, which, are, first, based, on, the, conviction, that, what, christianity, has, traditionally, denounced, as, idolatry, and, superstition, actually, represents, represented, a, profound, and, meaningful, religious, worldview, and, secondly, that, a, religious, practice, based, on, this, worldview, can, and, should, be, revitalized, in, our, modern, world, discussing, the, relationship, between, the, different, pagan, religions, religious, studies, scholars, kaarina, aitamurto, and, scott, simpson, wrote, that, they, were, like, siblings, who, have, taken, different, paths, in, life, but, still, retain, many, visible, similarities, but, there, has, been, much, cross, fertilization, between, these, different, faiths, many, groups, have, influenced, and, been, influenced, by, other, pagan, religions, making, clear, cut, distinctions, among, them, more, difficult, for, scholars, to, make, the, various, pagan, religions, have, been, academically, classified, as, new, religious, movements, with, the, anthropologist, kathryn, rountree, describing, paganism, as, a, whole, as, a, new, religious, phenomenon, a, number, of, academics, particularly, in, north, america, consider, modern, paganism, a, form, of, nature, religion, some, practitioners, completely, eschew, the, use, of, the, term, pagan, preferring, to, use, more, specific, names, for, their, religion, such, as, heathen, or, wiccan, this, is, because, the, term, pagan, originates, in, christian, terminology, which, individuals, who, object, to, the, term, wish, to, avoid, some, favor, the, term, ethnic, religion, the, world, pagan, congress, founded, in, 1998, soon, renamed, itself, the, european, congress, of, ethnic, religions, ecer, enjoying, that, term, s, association, with, the, greek, ethnos, and, the, academic, field, of, ethnology, within, linguistically, slavic, areas, of, europe, the, term, native, faith, is, often, favored, as, a, synonym, for, paganism, rendered, as, ridnovirstvo, in, ukrainian, rodnoverie, in, russian, and, rodzimowierstwo, in, polish, alternately, many, practitioners, in, these, regions, view, native, faith, as, a, category, within, modern, paganism, that, does, not, encompass, all, pagan, religions, other, terms, some, pagans, favor, include, traditional, religion, indigenous, religion, nativist, religion, and, reconstructionism, various, pagans, who, are, active, in, pagan, studies, such, as, michael, york, and, prudence, jones, have, argued, that, due, to, the, similarities, of, their, worldviews, the, modern, pagan, movement, can, be, treated, as, part, of, the, same, global, phenomenon, as, pre, christian, ancient, religions, living, indigenous, religions, and, world, religions, like, hinduism, shinto, and, afro, american, religions, they, have, also, suggested, that, these, could, all, be, included, under, the, rubric, of, paganism, this, approach, has, been, received, critically, by, many, specialists, in, religious, studies, critics, have, pointed, out, that, such, claims, would, cause, problems, for, analytic, scholarship, by, lumping, together, belief, systems, with, very, significant, differences, and, that, the, term, would, serve, modern, pagan, interests, by, making, the, movement, appear, far, larger, on, the, world, stage, doyle, white, writes, that, modern, religions, that, draw, upon, the, pre, christian, belief, systems, of, other, parts, of, the, world, such, as, sub, saharan, africa, or, the, americas, cannot, be, seen, as, part, of, the, contemporary, pagan, movement, which, is, fundamentally, eurocentric, similarly, strmiska, stresses, that, modern, paganism, should, not, be, conflated, with, the, belief, systems, of, the, world, s, indigenous, peoples, because, the, latter, lived, under, colonialism, and, its, legacy, and, that, while, some, pagan, worldviews, bear, similarities, to, those, of, indigenous, communities, they, stem, from, different, cultural, linguistic, and, historical, backgrounds, many, scholars, have, favored, the, use, of, neopaganism, to, describe, this, phenomenon, with, the, prefix, neo, serving, to, distinguish, the, modern, religions, from, their, ancient, pre, christian, forerunners, some, pagan, practitioners, also, prefer, neopaganism, believing, that, the, prefix, conveys, the, reformed, nature, of, the, religion, such, as, its, rejection, of, practices, such, as, animal, sacrifice, conversely, most, pagans, do, not, use, the, word, neopagan, with, some, expressing, disapproval, of, it, arguing, that, the, term, neo, offensively, disconnects, them, from, what, they, perceive, as, their, pre, christian, forebears, to, avoid, causing, offense, many, scholars, in, the, english, speaking, world, have, begun, using, the, prefixes, modern, or, contemporary, rather, than, neo, several, pagan, studies, scholars, such, as, ronald, hutton, and, sabina, magliocco, have, emphasized, the, use, of, the, upper, case, paganism, to, distinguish, the, modern, movement, from, the, lower, case, paganism, a, term, commonly, used, for, pre, christian, belief, systems, in, 2015, rountree, opined, that, this, lower, case, upper, case, division, was, now, convention, in, pagan, studies, among, the, critics, of, the, upper, case, p, are, york, and, andras, corban, arthen, president, of, the, ecer, capitalizing, the, word, they, argue, makes, paganism, appear, as, the, name, of, a, cohesive, religion, rather, than, a, generic, religious, category, and, comes, off, as, naive, dishonest, or, as, an, unwelcome, attempt, to, disrupt, the, spontaneity, and, vernacular, quality, of, the, movement, the, term, neo, pagan, was, coined, in, the, 19th, century, in, reference, to, renaissance, and, romanticist, hellenophile, classical, revivalism, by, the, mid, 1930s, neopagan, was, being, applied, to, new, religious, movements, like, jakob, wilhelm, hauer, s, german, faith, movement, and, jan, stachniuk, s, polish, zadruga, usually, by, outsiders, and, often, pejoratively, pagan, as, a, self, designation, appeared, in, 1964, and, 1965, in, the, publications, of, the, witchcraft, research, association, at, that, time, the, term, was, in, use, by, wiccans, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, but, unconnected, to, the, broader, counterculture, pagan, movement, the, modern, popularisation, of, the, terms, pagan, and, neopagan, as, they, are, currently, understood, is, largely, traced, to, oberon, zell, ravenheart, co, founder, of, the, 1st, neo, pagan, church, of, all, worlds, who, beginning, in, 1967, with, the, early, issues, of, green, egg, used, both, terms, for, the, growing, movement, this, usage, has, been, common, since, the, pagan, revival, in, the, 1970s, according, to, strmiska, the, reappropriation, of, the, term, pagan, by, modern, pagans, served, as, a, deliberate, act, of, defiance, against, traditional, christian, dominated, society, allowing, them, to, use, it, as, a, source, of, pride, and, power, in, this, he, compared, it, to, the, gay, liberation, movement, s, reappropriation, of, the, term, queer, which, had, formerly, been, used, only, as, a, term, of, homophobic, abuse, he, suggests, that, part, of, the, term, s, appeal, lay, in, the, fact, that, a, large, proportion, of, pagan, converts, were, raised, in, christian, families, and, that, by, embracing, the, term, pagan, a, word, long, used, for, what, was, rejected, and, reviled, by, christian, authorities, a, convert, summarizes, in, a, single, word, his, or, her, definitive, break, from, christianity, he, further, suggests, that, the, term, gained, appeal, through, its, depiction, in, romanticist, and, 19th, century, european, nationalist, literature, where, it, had, been, imbued, with, a, certain, mystery, and, allure, and, that, by, embracing, the, word, pagan, modern, pagans, defy, past, religious, intolerance, to, honor, the, pre, christian, peoples, of, europe, and, emphasize, those, societies, cultural, and, artistic, achievements, we, might, say, that, reconstructionist, pagans, romanticize, the, past, while, eclectic, pagans, idealize, the, future, in, the, first, case, there, is, a, deeply, felt, need, to, connect, with, the, past, as, a, source, of, spiritual, strength, and, wisdom, in, the, second, case, there, is, the, idealistic, hope, that, a, spirituality, of, nature, can, be, gleaned, from, ancient, sources, and, shared, with, all, humanity, religious, studies, scholar, michael, strmiska, modern, pagan, attitudes, differ, regarding, the, source, material, surrounding, pre, christian, belief, systems, strmiska, notes, that, pagan, groups, can, be, divided, along, a, continuum, at, one, end, are, those, that, aim, to, reconstruct, the, ancient, religious, traditions, of, a, particular, ethnic, group, or, a, linguistic, or, geographic, area, to, the, highest, degree, possible, at, the, other, end, are, those, that, freely, blend, traditions, of, different, areas, peoples, and, time, periods, strmiska, argues, that, these, two, poles, could, be, termed, reconstructionism, and, eclecticism, respectively, reconstructionists, do, not, altogether, reject, innovation, in, their, interpretation, and, adaptation, of, the, source, material, however, they, do, believe, that, the, source, material, conveys, greater, authenticity, and, thus, should, be, emphasized, they, often, follow, scholarly, debates, about, the, nature, of, such, pre, christian, religions, and, some, reconstructionists, are, themselves, scholars, eclectic, pagans, conversely, seek, general, inspiration, from, the, pre, christian, past, and, do, not, attempt, to, recreate, past, rites, or, traditions, with, specific, attention, to, detail, on, the, reconstructionist, side, can, be, placed, those, movements, which, often, favour, the, designation, native, faith, including, romuva, heathenry, and, hellenism, on, the, eclectic, side, has, been, placed, wicca, thelema, adonism, druidry, the, goddess, movement, discordianism, and, the, radical, faeries, strmiska, also, suggests, that, this, division, could, be, seen, as, being, based, on, discourses, of, identity, with, reconstructionists, emphasizing, a, deep, rooted, sense, of, place, and, people, and, eclectics, embracing, a, universality, and, openness, toward, humanity, and, the, earth, strmiska, nevertheless, notes, that, this, reconstructionist, eclectic, division, is, neither, as, absolute, nor, as, straightforward, as, it, might, appear, he, cites, the, example, of, dievtur, ba, a, form, of, reconstructionist, paganism, that, seeks, to, revive, the, pre, christian, religion, of, the, latvian, people, by, noting, that, it, exhibits, eclectic, tendencies, by, adopting, a, monotheistic, focus, and, ceremonial, structure, from, lutheranism, similarly, while, examining, neo, shamanism, among, the, sami, people, of, northern, scandinavia, siv, ellen, kraft, highlights, that, despite, the, religion, being, reconstructionist, in, intent, it, is, highly, eclectic, in, the, manner, in, which, it, has, adopted, elements, from, shamanic, traditions, in, other, parts, of, the, world, in, discussing, asatro, a, form, of, heathenry, based, in, denmark, matthew, amster, notes, that, it, did, not, fit, clearly, within, such, a, framework, because, while, seeking, a, reconstructionist, form, of, historical, accuracy, asatro, strongly, eschewed, the, emphasis, on, ethnicity, that, is, common, to, other, reconstructionist, groups, while, wicca, is, identified, as, an, eclectic, form, of, paganism, strmiska, also, notes, that, some, wiccans, have, moved, in, a, more, reconstructionist, direction, by, focusing, on, a, particular, ethnic, and, cultural, link, thus, developing, such, variants, as, norse, wicca, and, celtic, wicca, concern, has, also, been, expressed, regarding, the, utility, of, the, term, reconstructionism, when, dealing, with, paganisms, in, central, and, eastern, europe, because, in, many, of, the, languages, of, these, regions, equivalents, of, the, term, reconstructionism, such, as, the, czech, historick, rekonstrukce, and, lithuanian, istorin, rekonstrukcija, are, already, used, to, define, the, secular, hobby, of, historical, re, enactment, the, spectrum, of, modern, paganism, includes, a, range, of, ecologic, and, explicitly, ecocentric, practices, which, may, overlap, with, scientific, pantheism, pagans, may, distinguish, their, beliefs, and, practices, as, a, form, of, religious, naturalism, or, naturalist, philosophy, with, some, engaged, as, humanistic, or, atheopagans, for, some, pagan, groups, ethnicity, is, central, to, their, religion, and, some, restrict, membership, to, a, single, ethnic, group, some, critics, have, described, this, approach, as, a, form, of, racism, other, pagan, groups, allow, people, of, any, ethnicity, on, the, view, that, the, gods, and, goddesses, of, a, particular, region, can, call, anyone, to, their, form, of, worship, some, such, groups, feel, a, particular, affinity, for, the, pre, christian, belief, systems, of, a, particular, region, with, which, they, have, no, ethnic, link, because, they, see, themselves, as, reincarnations, of, people, from, that, society, there, is, greater, focus, on, ethnicity, within, the, pagan, movements, in, continental, europe, than, within, the, pagan, movements, in, north, america, and, the, british, isles, such, ethnic, paganisms, have, variously, been, seen, as, responses, to, concerns, about, foreign, ideologies, globalization, cosmopolitanism, and, anxieties, about, cultural, erosion, although, they, acknowledged, that, it, was, a, highly, simplified, model, aitamurto, and, simpson, wrote, that, there, was, some, truth, to, the, claim, that, leftist, oriented, forms, of, paganism, were, prevalent, in, north, america, and, the, british, isles, while, rightist, oriented, forms, of, paganism, were, prevalent, in, central, and, eastern, europe, they, noted, that, in, these, latter, regions, pagan, groups, placed, an, emphasis, on, the, centrality, of, the, nation, the, ethnic, group, or, the, tribe, rountree, wrote, that, it, was, wrong, to, assume, that, expressions, of, paganism, can, be, categorized, straight, forwardly, according, to, region, but, acknowledged, that, some, regional, trends, were, visible, such, as, the, impact, of, catholicism, on, paganism, in, southern, europe, modern, pagans, are, reviving, reconstructing, and, reimagining, religious, traditions, of, the, past, that, were, suppressed, for, a, very, long, time, even, to, the, point, of, being, almost, totally, obliterated, thus, with, only, a, few, possible, exceptions, today, s, pagans, cannot, claim, to, be, continuing, religious, traditions, handed, down, in, an, unbroken, line, from, ancient, times, to, the, present, they, are, modern, people, with, a, great, reverence, for, the, spirituality, of, the, past, making, a, new, religion, a, modern, paganism, from, the, remnants, of, the, past, which, they, interpret, adapt, and, modify, according, to, modern, ways, of, thinking, religious, studies, scholar, michael, strmiska, although, inspired, by, the, pre, christian, belief, systems, of, the, past, modern, paganism, is, not, the, same, phenomenon, as, these, lost, traditions, and, in, many, respects, differs, from, them, considerably, strmiska, stresses, that, modern, paganism, is, a, new, modern, religious, movement, even, if, some, of, its, content, derives, from, ancient, sources, contemporary, paganism, as, practiced, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1990s, has, been, described, as, a, synthesis, of, historical, inspiration, and, present, day, creativity, eclectic, paganism, takes, an, undogmatic, religious, stance, and, therefore, potentially, sees, no, one, as, having, authority, to, deem, a, source, apocryphal, contemporary, paganism, has, therefore, been, prone, to, fakelore, especially, in, recent, years, as, information, and, misinformation, alike, have, been, spread, on, the, internet, and, in, print, media, a, number, of, wiccan, pagan, and, even, some, traditionalist, or, tribalist, groups, have, a, history, of, grandmother, stories, typically, involving, initiation, by, a, grandmother, grandfather, or, other, elderly, relative, who, is, said, to, have, instructed, them, in, the, secret, millennia, old, traditions, of, their, ancestors, as, this, secret, wisdom, can, almost, always, be, traced, to, recent, sources, tellers, of, these, stories, have, often, later, admitted, they, made, them, up, strmiska, asserts, that, contemporary, paganism, could, be, viewed, as, a, part, of, the, much, larger, phenomenon, of, efforts, to, revive, traditional, indigenous, or, native, religions, that, were, occurring, across, the, globe, beliefs, and, practices, vary, widely, among, different, pagan, groups, however, there, are, a, series, of, core, principles, common, to, most, if, not, all, forms, of, modern, paganism, the, english, academic, graham, harvey, noted, that, pagans, rarely, indulge, in, theology, one, principle, of, the, pagan, movement, is, polytheism, the, belief, in, and, veneration, of, multiple, gods, or, goddesses, within, the, pagan, movement, there, can, be, found, many, deities, both, male, and, female, who, have, various, associations, and, embody, forces, of, nature, aspects, of, culture, and, facets, of, human, psychology, these, deities, are, typically, depicted, in, human, form, and, are, viewed, as, having, human, faults, they, are, therefore, not, seen, as, perfect, but, rather, are, venerated, as, being, wise, and, powerful, pagans, feel, that, this, understanding, of, the, gods, reflected, the, dynamics, of, life, on, earth, allowing, for, the, expression, of, humour, one, view, in, the, pagan, community, is, that, these, polytheistic, deities, are, not, viewed, as, literal, entities, but, as, jungian, archetypes, or, other, psychological, constructs, that, exist, in, the, human, psyche, others, adopt, the, belief, that, the, deities, have, both, a, psychological, and, external, existence, many, pagans, believe, adoption, of, a, polytheistic, world, view, would, be, beneficial, for, western, society, replacing, the, dominant, monotheism, they, see, as, innately, repressive, in, fact, many, american, modern, pagans, first, came, to, their, adopted, faiths, because, it, allowed, a, greater, freedom, diversity, and, tolerance, of, worship, among, the, community, this, pluralistic, perspective, has, helped, the, varied, factions, of, modern, paganism, exist, in, relative, harmony, most, pagans, adopt, an, ethos, of, unity, in, diversity, regarding, their, religious, beliefs, it, is, its, inclusion, of, female, deity, which, distinguishes, pagan, religions, from, their, abrahamic, counterparts, in, wicca, male, and, female, deities, are, typically, balanced, out, in, a, form, of, duotheism, among, many, pagans, there, is, a, strong, desire, to, incorporate, the, female, aspects, of, the, divine, in, their, worship, and, within, their, lives, which, can, partially, explain, the, attitude, which, sometimes, manifests, as, the, veneration, of, women, there, are, exceptions, to, polytheism, in, paganism, as, seen, for, instance, in, the, form, of, ukrainian, paganism, promoted, by, lev, sylenko, which, is, devoted, to, a, monotheistic, veneration, of, the, god, dazhbog, as, noted, above, pagans, with, naturalistic, worldviews, may, not, believe, in, or, work, with, deities, at, all, pagan, religions, commonly, exhibit, a, metaphysical, concept, of, an, underlying, order, that, pervades, the, universe, such, as, the, concept, of, harmonia, embraced, by, hellenists, and, that, of, wyrd, found, in, heathenry, a, key, part, of, most, pagan, worldviews, is, the, holistic, concept, of, a, universe, that, is, interconnected, this, is, connected, with, a, belief, in, either, pantheism, or, panentheism, in, both, beliefs, divinity, and, the, material, or, spiritual, universe, are, one, for, pagans, pantheism, means, that, divinity, is, inseparable, from, nature, and, that, deity, is, immanent, in, nature, dennis, d, carpenter, noted, that, the, belief, in, a, pantheistic, or, panentheistic, deity, has, led, to, the, idea, of, interconnectedness, playing, a, key, part, in, pagans, worldviews, the, prominent, reclaiming, priestess, starhawk, related, that, a, core, part, of, goddess, centred, pagan, witchcraft, was, the, understanding, that, all, being, is, interrelated, that, we, are, all, linked, with, the, cosmos, as, parts, of, one, living, organism, what, affects, one, of, us, affects, us, all, another, pivotal, belief, in, the, contemporary, pagan, movement, is, that, of, animism, this, has, been, interpreted, in, two, distinct, ways, among, the, pagan, community, first, it, can, refer, to, a, belief, that, everything, in, the, universe, is, imbued, with, a, life, force, or, spiritual, energy, in, contrast, some, contemporary, pagans, believe, that, there, are, specific, spirits, that, inhabit, various, features, in, the, natural, world, and, that, these, can, be, actively, communicated, with, some, pagans, have, reported, experiencing, communication, with, spirits, dwelling, in, rocks, plants, trees, and, animals, as, well, as, power, animals, or, animal, spirits, who, can, act, as, spiritual, helpers, or, guides, animism, was, also, a, concept, common, to, many, pre, christian, european, religions, and, in, adopting, it, contemporary, pagans, are, attempting, to, reenter, the, primeval, worldview, and, participate, in, a, view, of, cosmology, that, is, not, possible, for, most, westerners, after, childhood, all, pagan, movements, place, great, emphasis, on, the, divinity, of, nature, as, a, primary, source, of, divine, will, and, on, humanity, s, membership, of, the, natural, world, bound, in, kinship, to, all, life, and, the, earth, itself, the, animistic, aspects, of, pagan, theology, assert, that, all, things, have, a, soul, not, just, humans, or, organic, life, so, this, bond, is, held, with, mountains, and, rivers, as, well, as, trees, and, wild, animals, as, a, result, pagans, believe, the, essence, of, their, spirituality, is, both, ancient, and, timeless, regardless, of, the, age, of, specific, religious, movements, places, of, natural, beauty, are, therefore, treated, as, sacred, and, ideal, for, ritual, like, the, nemetons, of, the, ancient, celts, many, pagans, hold, that, different, lands, and, or, cultures, have, their, own, natural, religion, with, many, legitimate, interpretations, of, divinity, and, therefore, reject, religious, exclusivism, while, the, pagan, community, has, tremendous, variety, in, political, views, spanning, the, whole, of, the, political, spectrum, environmentalism, is, often, a, common, feature, such, views, have, also, led, many, pagans, to, revere, the, planet, earth, as, mother, earth, who, is, often, referred, to, as, gaia, after, the, ancient, greek, goddess, of, the, earth, pagan, ritual, can, take, place, in, both, a, public, and, private, setting, contemporary, pagan, ritual, is, typically, geared, towards, facilitating, altered, states, of, awareness, or, shifting, mind, sets, in, order, to, induce, such, altered, states, of, consciousness, pagans, utilize, such, elements, as, drumming, visualization, chanting, singing, dancing, and, meditation, american, folklorist, sabina, magliocco, came, to, the, conclusion, based, upon, her, ethnographic, fieldwork, in, california, that, certain, pagan, beliefs, arise, from, what, they, experience, during, religious, ecstasy, sociologist, margot, adler, highlighted, how, several, pagan, groups, like, the, reformed, druids, of, north, america, and, the, erisian, movement, incorporate, a, great, deal, of, play, in, their, rituals, rather, than, having, them, be, completely, serious, and, somber, she, noted, that, there, are, those, who, would, argue, that, the, pagan, community, is, one, of, the, only, spiritual, communities, that, is, exploring, humor, joy, abandonment, even, silliness, and, outrageousness, as, valid, parts, of, spiritual, experience, domestic, worship, typically, takes, place, in, the, home, and, is, carried, out, by, either, an, individual, or, family, group, it, typically, involves, offerings, including, bread, cake, flowers, fruit, milk, beer, or, wine, being, given, to, images, of, deities, often, accompanied, with, prayers, and, songs, and, the, lighting, of, candles, and, incense, common, pagan, devotional, practices, have, thus, been, compared, to, similar, practices, in, hinduism, buddhism, shinto, roman, catholicism, and, orthodox, christianity, but, contrasted, with, that, in, protestantism, judaism, and, islam, although, animal, sacrifice, was, a, common, part, of, pre, christian, ritual, in, europe, it, is, rarely, practiced, in, contemporary, paganism, paganism, s, public, rituals, are, generally, calendrical, although, the, pre, christian, festivals, that, pagans, use, as, a, basis, varied, across, europe, nevertheless, common, to, almost, all, pagan, religions, is, an, emphasis, on, an, agricultural, cycle, and, respect, for, the, dead, common, pagan, festivals, include, those, marking, the, summer, solstice, and, winter, solstice, as, well, as, the, start, of, spring, and, the, harvest, in, wicca, and, druidry, a, wheel, of, the, year, has, been, developed, which, typically, involves, eight, seasonal, festivals, the, belief, in, magical, rituals, and, spells, is, held, by, a, significant, number, of, contemporary, pagans, among, those, who, believe, in, it, there, are, a, variety, of, different, views, about, what, magic, is, many, modern, pagans, adhere, to, the, definition, of, magic, provided, by, aleister, crowley, the, founder, of, thelema, the, science, and, art, of, causing, change, to, occur, in, conformity, with, will, also, accepted, by, many, is, the, related, definition, purportedly, provided, by, the, ceremonial, magician, dion, fortune, magic, is, the, art, and, science, of, changing, consciousness, according, to, the, will, among, those, who, practice, magic, are, wiccans, those, who, identify, as, neopagan, witches, and, practitioners, of, some, forms, of, revivalist, neo, druidism, the, rituals, of, which, are, at, least, partially, based, upon, those, of, ceremonial, magic, and, freemasonry, discussions, about, prevailing, returning, or, new, forms, of, paganism, have, existed, throughout, the, modern, period, before, the, 20th, century, christian, institutions, regularly, used, paganism, as, a, term, for, everything, outside, of, christianity, judaism, and, from, the, 18th, century, islam, they, frequently, associated, paganism, with, idolatry, magic, and, a, general, concept, of, false, religion, which, for, example, has, made, catholics, and, protestants, accuse, each, other, of, being, pagans, various, folk, beliefs, have, periodically, been, labeled, as, pagan, and, churches, have, demanded, that, they, should, be, purged, the, western, attitude, to, paganism, gradually, changed, during, the, early, modern, period, one, reason, was, increased, contacts, with, areas, outside, of, europe, which, happened, through, trade, christian, mission, and, colonization, increased, knowledge, of, other, cultures, led, to, questions, of, whether, their, practices, even, fit, into, the, definitions, of, religion, and, paganism, was, incorporated, in, the, idea, of, progress, where, it, was, ranked, as, a, low, undeveloped, form, of, religion, another, reason, for, change, was, the, circulation, of, ancient, writings, such, as, those, attributed, to, hermes, trismegistus, this, made, paganism, an, intellectual, position, some, europeans, began, to, self, identify, with, starting, at, the, latest, in, the, 15th, century, with, people, like, gemistus, pletho, who, wanted, to, establish, a, new, form, of, greco, roman, polytheism, positive, identification, with, paganism, became, more, common, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, when, it, tied, in, with, criticism, of, christianity, and, organized, religion, rooted, in, the, ideas, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, romanticism, the, approach, to, paganism, varied, during, this, period, friedrich, schiller, s, 1788, poem, die, g, tter, griechenlandes, presents, ancient, greek, religion, as, a, powerful, alternative, to, christianity, whereas, others, took, interest, in, paganism, through, the, concept, of, the, noble, savage, often, associated, with, jean, jacques, rousseau, during, the, french, revolution, and, first, french, republic, some, public, figures, incorporated, pagan, themes, in, their, worldviews, an, explicit, example, was, gabriel, andr, aucler, who, responded, to, both, christianity, and, enlightenment, atheism, by, performing, pagan, rites, and, arguing, for, renewed, pagan, religiosity, in, his, book, la, thr, icie, 1799, great, god, i, d, rather, be, a, pagan, suckled, in, a, creed, outworn, so, might, i, standing, on, this, pleasant, lea, have, glimpses, that, would, make, me, less, forlorn, have, sight, of, proteus, rising, from, the, sea, or, hear, old, triton, blow, his, wreath, d, horn, william, wordsworth, the, world, is, too, much, with, us, lines, 9, 14, one, of, the, origins, of, modern, pagan, movements, lies, in, the, romanticist, and, national, liberation, movements, that, developed, in, europe, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, publications, of, studies, into, european, folk, customs, and, culture, by, scholars, like, johann, gottfried, herder, and, jacob, grimm, resulted, in, a, wider, interest, in, these, subjects, and, a, growth, in, cultural, self, consciousness, at, the, time, it, was, commonly, believed, that, almost, all, such, folk, customs, were, survivals, from, the, pre, christian, period, these, attitudes, would, also, be, exported, to, north, america, by, european, immigrants, in, these, centuries, the, romantic, movement, of, the, 18th, century, led, to, the, re, discovery, of, old, gaelic, and, old, norse, literature, and, poetry, the, 19th, century, saw, a, surge, of, interest, in, germanic, paganism, with, the, viking, revival, in, victorian, britain, and, scandinavia, and, the, v, lkisch, movement, in, germany, these, currents, coincided, with, romanticist, interest, in, folklore, and, occultism, the, widespread, emergence, of, pagan, themes, in, popular, literature, and, the, rise, of, nationalism, the, rise, of, modern, paganism, is, both, a, result, and, a, measure, of, increased, religious, liberty, and, rising, tolerance, for, religious, diversity, in, modern, societies, a, liberty, and, tolerance, made, possible, by, the, curbing, of, the, sometimes, oppressive, power, wielded, by, christian, authorities, to, compel, obedience, and, participation, in, centuries, past, to, say, it, another, way, modern, paganism, is, one, of, the, happy, stepchildren, of, modern, multiculturalism, and, social, pluralism, religious, studies, scholar, michael, strmiska, the, rise, of, modern, paganism, was, aided, by, the, decline, in, christianity, throughout, many, parts, of, europe, and, north, america, as, well, as, by, the, concomitant, decline, in, enforced, religious, conformity, and, greater, freedom, of, religion, that, developed, allowing, people, to, explore, a, wider, range, of, spiritual, options, and, form, religious, organisations, that, could, operate, free, from, legal, persecution, historian, ronald, hutton, has, argued, that, many, of, the, motifs, of, 20th, century, neo, paganism, may, be, traced, back, to, the, utopian, mystical, counter, cultures, of, the, late, victorian, and, edwardian, periods, also, extending, in, some, instances, into, the, 1920s, via, the, works, of, amateur, folklorists, popular, authors, poets, political, radicals, and, alternative, lifestylers, prior, to, the, spread, of, the, 20th, century, modern, pagan, movements, a, notable, instance, of, self, identified, paganism, was, in, sioux, writer, zitkala, sa, s, essay, why, i, am, a, pagan, published, in, the, atlantic, monthly, in, 1902, the, native, american, activist, and, writer, outlined, her, rejection, of, christianity, referred, to, as, the, new, superstition, in, favor, of, a, harmony, with, nature, embodied, by, the, great, spirit, she, further, recounted, her, mother, s, abandonment, of, sioux, religion, and, the, unsuccessful, attempts, of, a, native, preacher, to, get, her, to, attend, the, village, church, in, the, 1920s, margaret, murray, theorized, that, a, secret, pagan, religion, had, survived, the, witchcraft, persecutions, enacted, by, the, ecclesiastical, and, secular, courts, historians, now, reject, murray, s, theory, as, she, based, it, partially, upon, the, similarities, of, the, accounts, given, by, those, accused, of, witchcraft, such, similarity, is, now, thought, to, actually, derive, from, there, having, been, a, standard, set, of, questions, laid, out, in, the, witch, hunting, manuals, used, by, interrogators, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, saw, a, resurgence, in, neo, druidism, as, well, as, the, rise, of, modern, germanic, paganism, in, the, united, states, and, in, iceland, in, the, 1970s, wicca, was, notably, influenced, by, feminism, leading, to, the, creation, of, an, eclectic, goddess, worshipping, movement, known, as, dianic, wicca, the, 1979, publication, of, margot, adler, s, drawing, down, the, moon, and, starhawk, s, the, spiral, dance, opened, a, new, chapter, in, public, awareness, of, paganism, with, the, growth, and, spread, of, large, pagan, gatherings, and, festivals, in, the, 1980s, public, varieties, of, wicca, continued, to, further, diversify, into, additional, eclectic, sub, denominations, often, heavily, influenced, by, the, new, age, and, counter, culture, movements, these, open, unstructured, or, loosely, structured, traditions, contrast, with, british, traditional, wicca, which, emphasizes, secrecy, and, initiatory, lineage, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, also, saw, an, increasing, interest, in, serious, academic, research, and, reconstructionist, pagan, traditions, the, establishment, and, growth, of, the, internet, in, the, 1990s, brought, rapid, growth, to, these, and, other, pagan, movements, by, the, time, of, the, collapse, of, the, former, soviet, union, in, 1991, freedom, of, religion, was, legally, established, across, russia, and, a, number, of, other, newly, independent, states, allowing, for, the, growth, in, both, christian, and, non, christian, religions, in, contrast, to, the, eclectic, traditions, polytheistic, reconstructionists, practice, culturally, specific,

make, up, just, 45, percent, of, the, republic, s, population, of, 700, 000, this, figure, means, that, probably, more, than, a, third, claim, to, follow, the, old, religion, the, percentage, of,

religious, institutions, and, other, third, party, statistical, organisations, based, on, the, most, recent, survey, by, the, pew, forum, on, religion, there, are, over, one, million, pagans, in, the, united, states, up, to, 0, 4, of, respondents, answered, pagan, or, wiccan, when, polled, according, to, helen, a, berger, s, 1995, survey, the, pagan, census, most, american, pagans, are, middle, class, educated, and, live, in, urban, suburban, areas, on, the, east, and, west, coasts, in, the, 2011, australian, census, 32, 083, respondents, identified, as, pagan, out, of, 21, 507, 717, recorded, australians, they, compose, approximately, 0, 15, of, the, population, the, australian, bureau, of, statistics, classifies, paganism, as, an, affiliation, under, which, several, sub, classifications, may, optionally, be, specified, this, includes, animism, nature, religion, druidism, pantheism, and, wicca, witchcraft, as, a, result, fairly, detailed, breakdowns, of, pagan, respondents, are, available, in, 2006, there, were, at, least, 6, 804, 0, 164, pagans, among, new, zealand, s, population, of, approximately, 4, million, respondents, were, given, the, option, to, select, one, or, more, religious, affiliations, based, upon, her, study, of, the, pagan, community, in, the, united, states, the, sociologist, margot, adler, noted, that, it, is, rare, for, pagan, groups, to, proselytize, in, order, to, gain, new, converts, to, their, faiths, instead, she, argued, that, in, most, cases, converts, first, become, interested, in, the, movement, through, word, of, mouth, a, discussion, between, friends, a, lecture, a, book, an, article, or, a, web, site, she, went, on, to, put, forward, the, idea, that, this, typically, confirmed, some, original, private, experience, so, that, the, most, common, experience, of, those, who, have, named, themselves, pagan, is, something, like, i, finally, found, a, group, that, has, the, same, religious, perceptions, i, always, had, a, practicing, wiccan, herself, adler, used, her, own, conversion, to, paganism, as, a, case, study, remarking, that, as, a, child, she, had, taken, a, great, interest, in, the, gods, and, goddesses, of, ancient, greece, and, had, performed, her, own, devised, rituals, in, dedication, to, them, when, she, eventually, came, across, the, wiccan, religion, many, years, later, she, then, found, that, it, confirmed, her, earlier, childhood, experiences, and, that, i, never, converted, in, the, accepted, sense, i, simply, accepted, reaffirmed, and, extended, a, very, old, experience, folklorist, sabina, magliocco, supported, this, idea, noting, that, a, great, many, of, those, californian, pagans, whom, she, interviewed, claimed, that, they, had, been, greatly, interested, in, mythology, and, folklore, as, children, imagining, a, world, of, enchanted, nature, and, magical, transformations, filled, with, lords, and, ladies, witches, and, wizards, and, humble, but, often, wise, peasants, magliocco, noted, that, it, was, this, world, that, pagans, strive, to, re, create, in, some, measure, further, support, for, adler, s, ideas, came, from, american, wiccan, priestess, judy, harrow, who, noted, that, among, her, comrades, there, was, a, feeling, that, you, don, t, become, pagan, you, discover, that, you, always, were, they, have, also, been, supported, by, pagan, studies, scholar, graham, harvey, many, pagans, in, north, america, encounter, the, movement, through, their, involvement, in, other, hobbies, particularly, popular, with, us, pagans, are, golden, age, type, pastimes, such, as, the, society, for, creative, anachronism, sca, star, trek, fandom, doctor, who, fandom, and, comic, book, fandom, other, ways, in, which, many, north, american, pagans, have, gotten, involved, with, the, movement, are, through, political, or, ecological, activism, such, as, vegetarian, groups, health, food, stores, or, feminist, university, courses, adler, went, on, to, note, that, from, those, she, interviewed, and, surveyed, in, the, us, she, could, identify, a, number, of, common, factors, that, led, to, people, getting, involved, in, paganism, the, beauty, vision, and, imagination, that, was, found, within, their, beliefs, and, rituals, a, sense, of, intellectual, satisfaction, and, personal, growth, that, they, imparted, their, support, for, environmentalism, or, feminism, and, a, sense, of, freedom, based, upon, her, work, in, the, united, states, adler, found, that, the, pagan, movement, was, very, diverse, in, its, class, and, ethnic, backgrounds, she, went, on, to, remark, that, she, had, encountered, pagans, in, jobs, that, ranged, from, fireman, to, phd, chemist, but, that, the, one, thing, she, thought, made, them, into, an, elite, was, being, avid, readers, something, that, she, found, to, be, very, common, within, the, pagan, community, despite, the, fact, that, avid, readers, constituted, less, than, 20, of, the, general, population, of, the, united, states, at, the, time, magliocco, came, to, a, somewhat, different, conclusion, based, upon, her, ethnographic, research, of, pagans, in, california, remarking, that, the, majority, were, white, middle, class, well, educated, urbanites, but, that, they, were, united, in, finding, artistic, inspiration, within, folk, and, indigenous, spiritual, traditions, the, sociologist, regina, oboler, examined, the, role, of, gender, in, the, american, pagan, community, arguing, that, although, the, movement, had, been, constant, in, its, support, for, the, equality, of, men, and, women, ever, since, its, foundation, there, was, still, an, essentialist, view, of, gender, ingrained, within, it, with, female, deities, being, accorded, traditional, western, feminine, traits, and, male, deities, being, similarly, accorded, what, western, society, saw, as, masculine, traits, generally, modern, pagan, currents, in, western, countries, do, not, advocate, nationalist, or, far, right, ideologies, instead, they, advocate, individual, self, improvement, and, liberal, values, of, personal, freedom, gender, equality, and, environmental, protection, the, nationalist, sentiments, expressed, by, modern, pagans, in, western, countries, are, marginal, so, the, ideas, of, cosmopolitanism, are, prevalent, faith, and, dogmas, give, way, to, active, practices, including, psychotechnics, which, was, extensively, influenced, by, neo, hinduism, in, contrast, many, areas, of, post, soviet, modern, paganism, including, russian, are, occupied, not, so, much, with, individual, self, improvement, as, they, are, occupied, with, social, problems, and, they, also, create, nationalist, ideologies, based, on, the, invented, past, modern, paganism, is, one, of, the, directions, in, the, development, of, romantic, nationalism, with, its, components, such, as, the, idealization, of, a, particular, people, s, historical, or, mythological, past, dissatisfaction, with, modernity, and, the, ease, of, transition, to, a, radical, stage, with, the, postulation, of, national, superiority, the, volksgeist, which, is, given, great, attention, within, the, framework, of, ethnic, nationalism, is, often, identified, with, religion, so, there, is, a, desire, to, create, or, revive, one, s, religion, or, nationalize, one, of, the, world, s, religions, heinrich, heine, linked, nationalism, with, paganism, the, philosopher, nikolai, berdyaev, who, shared, heine, s, opinion, noted, the, regularity, of, the, tendency, of, the, transition, of, german, antisemitism, into, anti, christianity, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, spiritual, crisis, in, russia, led, to, a, fascination, with, paganism, at, first, ancient, and, then, slavic, native, gods, which, was, especially, true, for, the, symbolists, the, publicist, daniil, pasmanik, 1923, wrote, that, consistent, antisemitism, should, reject, judaism, and, christianity, he, noted, that, this, trend, had, already, led, germany, to, worship, odin, and, in, the, future, in, his, opinion, would, inevitably, lead, russia, to, worship, perun, german, occultism, and, modern, paganism, arose, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, they, became, influential, through, teachings, such, as, ariosophy, gaining, adherents, within, the, far, right, v, lkisch, movement, which, eventually, culminated, in, nazism, the, development, of, such, ideas, after, world, war, ii, gave, rise, to, wotanism, a, white, nationalist, modern, pagan, movement, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, in, germany, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, v, lkisch, movement, characterized, by, a, racist, antisemitic, ideology, of, radical, ethnic, nationalism, of, the, dominant, population, spread, the, central, elements, of, the, worldview, were, racism, and, elitism, the, movement, included, a, religious, modern, pagan, component, the, ideology, developed, out, of, german, nationalist, romanticism, nazism, is, considered, one, of, the, movements, within, the, v, lkisch, or, as, strongly, influenced, by, the, v, lkisch, v, lkisch, consisted, of, many, religiopolitical, groups, whose, leaders, and, followers, were, closely, associated, with, each, other, and, the, developing, nazi, party, this, ideology, significantly, impacted, various, aspects, of, german, culture, at, the, turn, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, liberalism, and, rationalism, which, demystified, the, time, honored, order, that, accepted, authorities, and, prejudices, also, caused, an, adverse, reaction, from, supporters, of, the, v, lkisch, movement, a, negative, attitude, towards, modernity, characterizes, the, writings, of, german, nationalist, prophets, such, as, paul, delagardie, julius, lang, and, arthur, moeller, van, den, bruck, the, movement, combined, a, sentimental, patriotic, interest, in, german, folklore, and, local, history, with, anti, urban, back, to, the, earth, populism, to, overcome, what, they, considered, the, ailment, of, scientific, and, rationalistic, modernity, the, authors, of, v, lkisch, found, a, spiritual, solution, in, the, essence, of, the, people, perceived, as, genuine, intuitive, even, primitive, in, the, sense, of, the, location, of, the, people, on, the, level, with, the, original, primordial, cosmic, order, v, lkisch, thinkers, tended, to, idealize, the, myth, of, the, original, nation, which, they, believed, could, still, be, found, in, rural, germany, a, form, of, primitive, democracy, freely, subject, to, its, natural, elite, the, idea, of, the, people, german, volk, was, subsequently, transformed, into, the, idea, of, racial, essence, and, v, lkisch, thinkers, understood, this, term, as, a, life, giving, and, quasi, eternal, essence, and, not, as, a, sociological, category, in, the, same, way, as, they, considered, nature, modern, pagan, ideas, were, present, in, ariosophy, an, esoteric, teaching, created, by, the, austrian, occultists, guido, von, list, and, j, rg, lanz, von, liebenfels, in, austria, between, 1890, and, 1930, the, term, ariosophy, can, also, be, used, generically, to, describe, the, aryan, esoteric, teachings, of, the, v, lkisch, subset, the, doctrine, of, ariosophy, was, based, on, pseudoscientific, ideas, about, aryan, purity, and, the, mystical, unity, of, spirit, and, body, it, was, influenced, by, the, german, nationalist, v, lkisch, movement, the, theosophy, of, helena, blavatsky, the, austrian, pan, german, movement, and, social, darwinism, and, its, racist, conclusions, ariosophy, influenced, the, ideology, of, nazism, the, works, of, the, ariosophists, describe, the, prehistoric, aryan, golden, age, when, the, wise, keepers, of, knowledge, learned, and, taught, occult, racial, teachings, and, ruled, over, a, racially, pure, society, it, is, alleged, that, there, is, an, evil, conspiracy, of, anti, german, forces, including, all, non, aryan, races, jews, and, the, christian, church, seeking, to, destroy, the, ideal, aryan, german, world, by, freeing, the, non, aryan, mob, to, establish, a, false, equality, of, the, illegitimate, representatives, of, non, aryan, races, history, including, wars, economic, crises, political, uncertainty, and, the, weakening, of, the, power, of, the, german, principle, is, seen, as, the, result, of, racial, mixing, the, doctrine, had, followers, in, austria, and, germany, occultism, in, the, doctrines, of, the, ariosophists, was, of, great, importance, as, a, sacral, justification, for, an, extreme, political, position, and, a, fundamental, rejection, of, reality, including, socio, economic, progress, the, ariosophists, sought, to, predict, and, justify, the, coming, era, of, the, german, world, order, to, counter, the, modern, world, corrupted, by, racial, mixing, the, ariosophists, created, many, small, circles, and, secret, religious, societies, to, revive, the, lost, esoteric, knowledge, and, racial, virtues, of, the, ancient, germans, to, create, a, new, pan, german, empire, to, recreate, the, religion, of, the, ancient, germans, list, used, the, scandinavian, epic, and, the, work, of, contemporary, theosophists, in, particular, max, ferdinand, sebaldt, von, werth, who, described, the, eugenic, practices, of, the, aryans, as, well, as, the, secret, doctrine, by, helena, blavatsky, and, the, lost, lemuria, by, william, scott, elliot, influenced, by, these, works, list, used, the, terms, ario, germans, and, race, instead, of, germans, and, people, perhaps, to, emphasize, the, overlap, with, the, fifth, root, race, in, blavatsky, s, scheme, list, and, lanz, developed, ideas, about, the, struggle, between, the, aryan, race, of, masters, and, the, race, of, slaves, and, about, the, ancestral, home, of, the, aryans, on, the, sunken, polar, island, of, arctogea, in, nazi, germany, germanic, pagan, folklore, as, a, source, of, primordial, moral, standards, was, revered, higher, than, christianity, associated, with, judaism, many, nazis, saw, anti, christianity, as, a, deeper, form, of, antisemitism, heinrich, himmler, spoke, of, the, need, to, create, a, neo, germanic, religion, capable, of, replacing, christianity, the, old, testament, was, especially, repugnant, to, the, nazis, adolf, hitler, called, it, satan, s, bible, rosenberg, demanded, that, it, be, banned, as, a, vehicle, of, jewish, influence, and, replaced, by, the, nordic, sagas, the, nazi, ideology, combined, the, veneration, of, the, pagan, heritage, of, the, ancestors, with, puritanical, christian, sexual, morality, which, the, nordic, apollo, was, supposed, to, personify, white, supremacist, ideologies, and, neo, nazism, including, ideas, of, racism, antisemitism, and, anti, lgbtq, have, infiltrated, or, assimilated, many, germanic, modern, pagan, movements, such, as, odinism, and, some, satr, groups, including, the, asatru, folk, assembly, these, groups, believe, that, the, germanic, beliefs, they, hold, constitute, the, true, caucasoid, ethnic, religion, the, issue, of, race, is, a, major, source, of, contention, among, modern, pagans, especially, in, the, united, states, in, the, modern, pagan, community, one, view, is, that, race, is, entirely, a, matter, of, biological, heredity, while, the, opposite, position, is, that, race, is, a, social, construct, rooted, in, cultural, heritage, in, us, modern, pagan, discourse, these, views, are, described, as, v, lkische, and, universalist, positions, respectively, the, two, factions, which, jeffrey, kaplan, has, called, the, racist, and, non, racist, camps, often, clash, with, kaplan, claiming, that, there, is, a, virtual, civil, war, between, them, within, the, american, modern, pagan, community, the, division, into, universalists, and, v, lkisch, also, spread, to, other, countries, but, had, less, impact, on, the, more, ethnically, homogeneous, iceland, a, 2015, survey, showed, that, more, modern, pagans, adhere, to, universalist, ideas, than, v, lkisch, going, beyond, this, binary, classification, religious, scholar, mattias, gardell, divides, modern, paganism, in, the, united, states, into, three, factions, according, to, their, racial, stance, religious, scholar, stephanie, von, schnurbein, accepted, gardell, s, tripartite, division, and, referred, to, these, groups, as, the, aracist, racial, religious, and, ethnic, factions, respectively, supporters, of, the, universalist, and, anti, racist, approach, believe, that, the, deities, of, germanic, europe, can, call, anyone, to, worship, them, regardless, of, ethnic, origin, this, group, rejects, the, v, lkisch, focus, on, race, believing, that, even, unintentionally, such, an, approach, can, lead, to, racist, attitudes, towards, people, of, non, northern, european, origin, practicing, universalists, such, as, stephan, grundy, emphasize, that, ancient, northern, europeans, married, and, had, children, with, members, of, other, ethnic, groups, and, in, norse, mythology, the, sir, did, the, same, with, the, vanir, j, tnar, and, humans, so, these, modern, pagans, criticize, racist, views, universalists, favorably, accept, practitioners, of, modern, paganism, who, are, not, of, northern, european, origin, for, example, the, troth, based, in, the, united, states, has, jewish, and, african, american, members, and, many, of, its, white, members, have, spouses, who, belong, to, different, racial, groups, while, some, pagans, continue, to, believe, that, germanic, paganism, is, an, innate, religion, universalists, have, sometimes, argued, that, this, paganism, is, an, innate, religion, for, the, lands, of, northern, europe, and, not, for, a, particular, race, universalists, often, complain, that, some, journalists, portray, modern, paganism, as, an, inherently, racist, movement, so, they, use, the, internet, to, highlight, their, opposition, to, far, right, politics, in, heathenry, the, terms, v, lkisch, neo, v, lkisch, or, the, anglicised, folkish, are, used, both, as, endonyms, and, exonyms, for, groups, who, believe, that, the, religion, is, closely, related, to, the, claimed, biological, race, v, lkisch, practitioners, consider, paganism, to, be, an, indigenous, religion, of, a, biologically, distinct, race, that, is, conceptualized, as, white, nordic, aryan, northern, european, or, english, v, lkisch, modern, pagans, generally, regard, these, classifications, as, self, evident, despite, the, academic, consensus, that, race, is, a, cultural, construct, v, lkisch, groups, often, use, ethnonationalist, language, and, claim, that, only, members, of, these, racial, groups, are, entitled, to, practice, a, given, religion, taking, the, pseudoscientific, view, that, gods, and, goddesses, are, encoded, in, the, dna, of, the, members, of, a, race, some, practitioners, explain, the, idea, of, linking, their, race, and, religion, by, saying, that, religion, is, inextricably, linked, to, the, collective, unconscious, of, that, race, the, american, modern, pagan, stephen, mcnallen, developed, these, ideas, into, a, concept, he, called, metagenetics, mcnallen, and, many, other, members, of, the, modern, pagan, ethnic, faction, explicitly, state, that, they, are, not, racist, although, gardell, has, noted, that, their, views, may, be, considered, racist, under, specific, definitions, of, the, term, gardell, considered, many, ethnic, modern, pagans, to, be, ethnic, nationalists, many, v, lkisch, practitioners, disapprove, of, multiculturalism, and, racial, mixing, in, modern, europe, advocating, racial, separatism, in, online, media, modern, pagan, v, lkische, often, express, a, belief, in, the, threat, of, racial, miscegenation, which, they, blame, on, the, social, and, political, establishment, sometimes, claiming, that, their, ideas, of, racial, exclusivity, are, the, result, of, the, threat, that, other, ethnic, groups, pose, to, white, people, while, these, groups, generally, claim, to, be, aiming, to, revive, germanic, paganism, their, race, centric, views, have, their, origins, in, 19th, century, culture, not, antiquity, this, group, s, discourse, contains, the, concepts, of, ancestors, and, homeland, which, are, understood, very, vaguely, researcher, ethan, doyle, white, characterizes, the, position, of, the, odinic, rite, and, the, odin, brotherhood, as, far, right, ethnocentric, modern, pagans, are, highly, critical, of, their, universalist, counterparts, often, claiming, that, the, latter, have, been, misled, by, new, age, literature, and, political, correctness, members, of, the, universalist, and, ethnocentric, factions, criticize, those, who, adopt, an, ethnic, stance, the, former, view, ethnic, modern, paganism, as, a, cover, for, racism, while, the, latter, view, its, adherents, as, race, traitors, for, their, refusal, to, fully, accept, the, superiority, of, the, white, race, some, modern, pagans, of, the, v, lkisch, movement, are, white, supremacists, and, outright, racists, representing, a, radical, racist, faction, that, uses, the, names, odinism, wotanism, and, wodenism, according, to, kaplan, these, adepts, occupy, the, most, remote, corners, of, modern, paganism, the, lines, between, this, form, of, modern, paganism, and, nazism, are, extremely, thin, because, its, adherents, praise, adolf, hitler, and, nazi, germany, claim, that, the, white, race, is, threatened, with, extinction, by, the, efforts, of, a, jewish, world, conspiracy, and, dismiss, christianity, as, a, work, of, the, jews, many, in, the, inner, circle, of, the, terrorist, organization, the, order, a, white, supremacist, militia, operating, in, the, us, in, the, 1980s, called, themselves, odinists, various, racist, modern, pagans, supported, the, fourteen, words, slogan, which, was, developed, by, the, order, member, david, lane, some, racist, organizations, such, as, the, order, of, nine, angles, and, the, black, order, combine, elements, of, modern, paganism, with, satanism, while, other, racist, modern, pagans, such, as, wotanist, ron, mcvan, reject, the, syncretism, of, the, two, religions, american, neo, nazi, william, luther, pierce, the, founder, of, the, neo, nazi, organization, national, alliance, whose, ideas, stimulated, neo, nazi, terrorism, also, created, the, cosmotheistic, community, church, in, 1978, he, considered, the, teaching, he, created, within, the, framework, of, this, church, to, be, pantheism, and, leaned, towards, the, panaryan, nordic, cults, these, cults, emphasized, the, idea, of, a, unique, closeness, of, white, people, with, nature, and, the, natural, spiritual, essence, which, was, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, savitri, devi, according, to, the, doctrine, each, race, has, its, predestined, role, whites, are, predisposed, to, strive, for, god, blacks, strive, for, laziness, and, jews, strive, for, corruption, in, 1985, pierce, purchased, a, large, piece, of, land, at, mill, point, in, west, virginia, fenced, it, in, with, barbed, wire, and, began, selling, books, on, western, culture, and, western, pagan, traditions, there, he, aimed, to, save, the, white, race, away, from, the, federal, government, in, part, he, also, drew, on, british, israelism, and, the, racist, religion, of, identity, christianity, the, national, alliance, met, regularly, to, discuss, the, ideas, of, cosmotheism, pierce, dismissed, christianity, as, one, of, the, chief, mental, illnesses, of, our, people, through, which, jewish, influence, spreads, pierce, saw, the, proposed, government, after, the, racial, revolution, as, religious, which, would, be, more, like, a, holy,

ideologues, just, like, in, germany, in, the, 1930s, in, rodnoverie, the, unity, of, the, russian, people, was, undergoing, a, new, re, mythologization, with, an, appeal, for, support, to, the, ideas, of, the, golden, age, the, primordial, untainted, tradition, and, the, native, land, historian, dmitry, shlapentokh, wrote, that, as, in, europe, neopaganism, in, russia, pushes, some, of, its, adherents, to, antisemitism, this, antisemitism, is, closely, related, to, negative, attitudes, towards, asians, and, this, emphasis, on, racial, factors, can, lead, neopagans, to, neo, nazism, the, tendency, of, neopagans, to, antisemitism, is, a, logical, development, of, the, ideas, of, neopaganism, and, imitation, of, the, nazis, and, is, also, a, consequence, of, some, specific, conditions, of, modern, russian, politics, unlike, previous, regimes, the, current, russian, political, regime, and, the, ideology, of, the, middle, class, combine, support, for, orthodoxy, with, philosemitism, and, a, positive, attitude, towards, muslims, these, features, of, the, regime, contributed, to, the, formation, of, specific, views, of, neo, nazi, neopagans, which, are, represented, to, a, large, extent, among, the, socially, unprotected, and, marginalized, russian, youth, in, their, opinion, power, in, russia, was, usurped, by, a, cabal, of, conspirators, including, hierarchs, of, the, orthodox, church, jews, and, muslims, contrary, to, external, differences, these, forces, are, believed, to, have, united, in, their, desire, to, maintain, power, over, the, russian, aryans, some, associations, of, neopaganism, in, particular, slavic, are, evaluated, by, researchers, as, extremist, radical, nationalists, in, russia, individual, neopagan, organizations, and, essays, were, included, in, the, list, of, extremist, organizations, of, the, ministry, of, justice, of, russia, and, the, federal, list, of, extremist, materials, respectively, the, historian, and, ethnologist, victor, schnirelmann, considers, russian, neopaganism, as, a, direction, of, russian, nationalism, that, denies, russian, orthodoxy, as, an, enduring, national, value, and, distinguishes, two, cardinal, tasks, that, russian, neopaganism, sets, for, itself, the, salvation, of, russian, national, culture, from, the, leveling, influence, of, modernization, and, the, protection, of, the, natural, environment, from, the, impact, of, modern, civilization, according, to, schnirelmann, russian, neopaganism, is, a, radical, variety, of, conservative, ideology, which, is, distinguished, by, frank, anti, intellectualism, and, populism, religious, scholar, alexei, gaidukov, considers, it, wrong, to, reduce, the, diversity, of, native, faith, groups, to, nationalism, only, he, views, the, ecological, direction, of, rodnovery, as, no, less, significant, historian, and, religious, scholar, roman, shizhensky, believes, rodnovery, poses, little, danger, and, law, enforcement, agencies,

its, dawn, several, millennia, before, roman, colonization, and, christianity, according, to, him, before, charlemagne, s, forced, introduction, of, christianity, wotanism, was, practiced, in, what,

list, considered, the, entire, christian, period, as, an, era, of, cultural, decline, oblivion, of, the, true, faith, and, unnatural, racial, mixing, when, the, aryan, ruling, caste, of, priest, kings, was, forced, to, hide, secretly, saving, their, sacred, knowledge, which, now, became, available, to, list, as, a, full, fledged, aristocratic, descendant, of, this, caste, in, slavic, neopaganism, there, is, the, idea, of, an, ancient, multi, thousand, year, old, and, developed, civilization, of, the, slavs, aryans, while, the, entire, christian, period, seems, to, be, an, era, of, regression, and, decline, the, enslavement, of, the, aryans, by, foreign, missionaries, who, imposed, on, them, a, slave, christian, ideology, rodnovers, often, regard, these, missionaries, as, jews, judeo, masons, or, their, accomplices, at, the, same, time, the, slavic, aryan, volkhvs, or, priests, had, to, hide, in, secret, places, preserving, the, knowledge, that, was, now, passed, onto, their, direct, descendants, rodnovers, the, idea, of, the, jewish, khazar, origin, of, prince, vladimir, the, great, is, popular, explaining, why, he, introduced, christianity, an, instrument, for, the, enslavement, of, the, aryans, by, jews, and, staged, the, genocide, of, the, pagan, slavs, roman, shizhensky, singles, out, the, neopagan, myth, about, vladimir, and, characterizes, it, as, one, of, the, most, odious, neopagan, historical, myths, and, one, of, the, leading, russian, neopagan, myths, in, terms, of, worldview, significance, the, author, of, this, myth, is, valery, yemelyanov, one, of, the, founders, of, russian, neopaganism, who, expounded, it, in, his, book, dezionization, 1970s, shizhensky, notes, that, the, neopagan, myth, about, vladimir, contradicts, scientific, work, on, the, issue, and, the, totality, of, historical, sources, concerning, the, trend, of, convergence, of, neopagan, associations, from, different, countries, andrey, beskov, notes, that, neopagan, nationalism, is, not, an, obstacle, to, neopagan, internationalism, and, anti, globalism, one, of, the, manifestations, of, which, was, the, popularity, of, ethnic, religions, itself, acquires, a, global, character, the, western, lgbt, community, often, marginalized, and, or, outright, rejected, by, abrahamic, predominant, mainstream, religious, establishments, has, often, sought, spiritual, acceptance, and, association, in, neopagan, religious, spiritual, practice, pagan, specializing, religious, scholar, christine, hoff, kraemer, wrote, pagans, tend, to, be, relatively, accepting, of, same, sex, relationships, bdsm, polyamory, transgender, people, and, other, expressions, of, gender, and, sexuality, that, are, marginalized, by, mainstream, society, conflict, naturally, arises, however, as, some, neopagan, belief, systems, and, sect, ideologies, stem, from, fundamental, beliefs, in, the, male, female, gender, binary, heterosexual, pairing, resulting, heterosexual, reproduction, and, or, gender, essentialism, in, response, groups, and, sects, inclusive, of, or, specific, to, lgbt, people, have, developed, theologian, jone, salomonsen, noted, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, that, the, reclaiming, movement, of, san, francisco, featured, an, unusually, high, number, of, lgbt, people, particularly, bisexuals, margot, adler, noted, groups, whose, practices, focused, on, male, homosexuality, such, as, eddie, buczynski, s, minoan, brotherhood, a, wiccan, sect, that, combines, the, iconography, from, ancient, minoan, religion, with, a, wiccan, theology, and, an, emphasis, on, men, who, love, men, and, the, eclectic, pagan, group, known, as, the, radical, faeries, when, adler, asked, one, gay, male, pagan, what, the, pagan, community, offered, members, of, the, lgbt, community, he, replied, a, place, to, belong, community, acceptance, and, a, way, to, connect, with, all, kinds, of, people, gay, bi, straight, celibate, transgender, in, a, way, that, is, hard, to, do, in, the, greater, society, transgender, existence, and, acceptability, is, especially, controversial, in, many, neopagan, sects, one, of, the, most, notable, of, these, is, dianic, wicca, this, female, only, radical, feminist, variant, of, wicca, allows, cisgender, lesbians, but, not, transgender, women, this, is, due, to, dianic, belief, in, gender, essentialism, according, to, founder, zsuzsanna, budapest, you, have, to, have, sometimes, in, your, life, a, womb, and, ovaries, and, and, not, die, this, belief, and, the, way, it, is, expressed, is, often, denounced, as, transphobia, and, trans, exclusionary, radical, feminism, trans, exclusion, can, also, be, found, in, alexandrian, wicca, whose, founder, views, trans, individuals, as, melancholy, people, who, should, seek, other, beliefs, due, to, the, alexandrian, focus, on, heterosexual, reproduction, and, duality, neopagan, practices, highlight, the, centrality, of, the, relationship, between, humans, and, nature, and, reinvent, religions, of, the, past, while, new, agers, are, more, interested, in, transforming, individual, consciousness, and, shaping, the, future, religious, studies, scholar, sarah, pike, since, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, contemporary, paganism, or, neo, paganism, and, the, then, emergent, counterculture, new, age, and, hippie, movements, experienced, a, degree, of, cross, pollination, an, issue, of, academic, debate, has, been, regarding, the, connection, between, these, movements, religious, studies, scholar, sarah, pike, asserted, that, in, the, united, states, there, was, a, significant, overlap, between, modern, paganism, and, new, age, while, aidan, a, kelly, stated, that, paganism, parallels, the, new, age, movement, in, some, ways, differs, sharply, from, it, in, others, and, overlaps, it, in, some, minor, ways, ethan, doyle, white, stated, that, while, the, pagan, and, new, age, movements, do, share, commonalities, and, overlap, they, were, nevertheless, largely, distinct, phenomena, hanegraaff, suggested, that, whereas, various, forms, of, contemporary, paganism, were, not, part, of, the, new, age, movement, particularly, those, who, pre, dated, the, movement, other, pagan, religions, and, practices, could, be, identified, as, new, age, various, differences, between, the, two, movements, have, been, highlighted, the, new, age, movement, focuses, on, an, improved, future, whereas, the, focus, of, paganism, is, on, the, pre, christian, past, similarly, the, new, age, movement, typically, propounds, a, universalist, message, which, sees, all, religions, as, fundamentally, the, same, whereas, paganism, stresses, the, difference, between, monotheistic, religions, and, those, embracing, a, polytheistic, or, animistic, theology, further, the, new, age, movement, shows, little, interest, in, magic, and, witchcraft, which, are, conversely, core, interests, of, pagan, religions, such, as, wicca, many, pagans, have, sought, to, distance, themselves, from, the, new, age, movement, even, using, new, age, as, an, insult, within, their, community, while, conversely, many, involved, in, the, new, age, have, expressed, criticism, of, paganism, for, emphasizing, the, material, world, over, the, spiritual, many, pagans, have, expressed, criticism, of, the, high, fees, charged, by, new, age, teachers, something, not, typically, present, in, the, pagan, movement, because, of, their, common, links, to, the, proto, indo, european, culture, many, adherents, of, modern, paganism, have, come, to, regard, hinduism, as, a, spiritual, relative, some, modern, pagan, literature, prominently, features, comparative, religion, involving, european, and, indian, traditions, the, ecer, has, made, efforts, to, establish, mutual, support, with, hindu, groups, as, has, the, lithuanian, romuva, movement, in, india, a, prominent, figure, who, made, similar, efforts, was, the, hindu, revivalist, ram, swarup, who, pointed, out, parallels, between, hinduism, and, european, and, arabic, paganism, swarup, reached, out, to, modern, pagans, in, the, west, and, also, had, an, influence, on, western, converts, to, hinduism, or, pro, hindu, activists, notably, david, frawley, and, koenraad, elst, who, both, have, described, hinduism, as, a, form, of, paganism, the, modern, pagan, writer, christopher, g, rard, has, drawn, much, inspiration, from, hinduism, and, visited, swarup, in, india, reviewing, g, rard, s, book, parcours, pa, en, in, 2001, the, historian, of, religion, jean, fran, ois, mayer, described, g, rard, s, activities, as, part, of, the, development, of, a, western, hindu, pagan, axis, in, the, islamic, world, pagans, are, not, considered, people, of, the, book, so, they, do, not, have, the, same, status, as, abrahamic, religions, in, islamic, religious, law, for, example, muslim, men, cannot, marry, pagan, women, while, they, are, allowed, to, marry, among, people, of, the, book, and, muslims, can, eat, meat, of, halal, animals, that, are, slaughtered, by, people, of, the, book, but, not, that, slaughtered, by, methods, of, other, religions, regarding, european, paganism, in, modern, paganism, in, world, cultures, comparative, perspectives, michael, f, strmiska, writes, that, in, pagan, magazines, websites, and, internet, discussion, venues, christianity, is, frequently, denounced, as, an, antinatural, antifemale, sexually, and, culturally, repressive, guilt, ridden, and, authoritarian, religion, that, has, fostered, intolerance, hypocrisy, and, persecution, throughout, the, world, further, there, is, a, common, belief, in, the, pagan, community, that, christianity, and, paganism, are, opposing, belief, systems, this, animosity, is, flamed, by, historical, conflicts, between, christian, and, pre, christian, religions, as, well, as, the, perceived, ongoing, christian, disdain, from, christians, some, pagans, have, claimed, that, christian, authorities, have, never, apologized, for, the, religious, displacement, of, europe, s, pre, christian, belief, systems, particularly, following, the, roman, catholic, church, s, apology, for, past, antisemitism, in, its, a, reflection, on, the, shoah, they, also, express, disapproval, of, christianity, s, continued, missionary, efforts, around, the, globe, at, the, expense, of, indigenous, and, other, polytheistic, faiths, some, christian, authors, have, published, books, criticizing, modern, paganism, while, other, christian, critics, have, equated, paganism, with, satanism, which, is, often, portrayed, as, such, in, mainstream, entertainment, industry, in, areas, such, as, the, us, bible, belt, where, conservative, christian, dominance, is, strong, pagans, have, faced, continued, religious, persecution, for, instance, strmiska, highlighted, instances, in, both, the, us, and, uk, in, which, school, teachers, were, fired, when, their, employers, discovered, that, they, were, pagan, thus, many, pagans, keep, their, religion, private, to, avoid, discrimination, and, ostracism, the, earliest, academic, studies, of, contemporary, paganism, were, published, in, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, by, scholars, like, margot, adler, marcello, truzzi, and, tanya, luhrmann, although, it, would, not, be, until, the, 1990s, that, the, actual, multidisciplinary, academic, field, of, pagan, studies, properly, developed, pioneered, by, academics, such, as, graham, harvey, and, chas, s, clifton, increasing, academic, interest, in, paganism, has, been, attributed, to, the, new, religious, movement, s, increasing, public, visibility, as, it, began, interacting, with, the, interfaith, movement, and, holding, large, public, celebrations, at, sites, like, stonehenge, the, first, international, academic, conference, on, the, subject, of, pagan, studies, was, held, at, the, university, of, newcastle, upon, tyne, north, east, england, in, 1993, it, was, organised, by, two, british, religious, studies, scholars, graham, harvey, and, charlotte, hardman, in, april, 1996, a, larger, conference, dealing, with, contemporary, paganism, took, place, at, ambleside, in, the, lake, district, organised, by, the, department, of, religious, studies, at, the, university, of, lancaster, north, west, england, it, was, entitled, nature, religion, today, western, paganism, shamanism, and, esotericism, in, the, 1990s, and, led, to, the, publication, of, an, academic, anthology, entitled, nature, religion, today, paganism, in, the, modern, world, in, 2004, the, first, peer, reviewed, academic, journal, devoted, to, pagan, studies, began, publication, the, pomegranate, the, international, journal, of, pagan, studies, was, edited, by, clifton, while, the, academic, publishers, altamira, press, began, release, of, the, pagan, studies, series, from, 2008, onward, conferences, have, been, held, bringing, together, scholars, specialising, in, the, study, of, paganism, in, central, and, eastern, europe, the, relationship, between, pagan, studies, scholars, and, some, practising, pagans, has, at, times, been, strained, the, australian, academic, and, practising, pagan, caroline, jane, tully, argues, that, many, pagans, can, react, negatively, to, new, scholarship, regarding, historical, pre, christian, societies, believing, that, it, is, a, threat, to, the, structure, of, their, beliefs, and, to, their, sense, of, identity, she, furthermore, argues, that, some, of, those, dissatisfied, pagans, lashed, out, against, academics, as, a, result, particularly, on, the, internet, neopaganism, has, been, criticized, on, a, variety, of, fronts, ranging, from, pseudohistory, to, racial, issues, to, institutional, issues, as, neopaganism, is, not, a, unified, religion, it, means, that, the, criticisms, of, certain, groups, often, do, not, apply, to, other, groups, criticisms, of, specific, neopagan, groups, range, from, criticisms, of, their, belief, in, gender, essentialism, to, criticisms, of, their, belief, in, nationalism, to, criticisms, of, the, worldly, focuses, of, pagan, organizations
