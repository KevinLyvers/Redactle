reportedly, haunted, locations, magic, sometimes, spelled, magick, is, the, application, of, beliefs, rituals, or, actions, employed, in, the, belief, that, they, can, manipulate, natural, or, supernatural, beings, and, forces, it, is, a, category, into, which, have, been, placed, various, beliefs, and, practices, sometimes, considered, separate, from, both, religion, and, science, connotations, have, varied, from, positive, to, negative, at, times, throughout, history, within, western, culture, magic, has, been, linked, to, ideas, of, the, other, foreignness, and, primitivism, indicating, that, it, is, a, powerful, marker, of, cultural, difference, and, likewise, a, non, modern, phenomenon, during, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, western, intellectuals, perceived, the, practice, of, magic, to, be, a, sign, of, a, primitive, mentality, and, also, commonly, attributed, it, to, marginalised, groups, of, people, aleister, crowley, 1875, 1947, a, british, occultist, defined, magick, as, the, science, and, art, of, causing, change, to, occur, in, conformity, with, will, adding, a, k, to, distinguish, ceremonial, or, ritual, magic, from, stage, magic, in, modern, occultism, and, neopagan, religions, many, self, described, magicians, and, witches, regularly, practice, ritual, magic, this, view, has, been, incorporated, into, chaos, magic, and, the, new, religious, movements, of, thelema, and, wicca, the, english, words, magic, mage, and, magician, come, from, the, latin, term, magus, through, the, greek, which, is, from, the, old, persian, magu, magician, the, old, persian, magu, is, derived, from, the, proto, indo, european, meg, magh, be, able, the, persian, term, may, have, led, to, the, old, sinitic, m, ag, mage, or, shaman, the, old, persian, form, seems, to, have, permeated, ancient, semitic, languages, as, the, talmudic, hebrew, magosh, the, aramaic, amgusha, magician, and, the, chaldean, maghdim, wisdom, and, philosophy, from, the, first, century, bce, onwards, syrian, magusai, gained, notoriety, as, magicians, and, soothsayers, during, the, late, sixth, and, early, fifth, centuries, bce, the, term, goetia, found, its, way, into, ancient, greek, where, it, was, used, with, negative, connotations, to, apply, to, rites, that, were, regarded, as, fraudulent, unconventional, and, dangerous, in, particular, they, dedicate, themselves, to, the, evocation, and, invocation, of, daimons, lesser, divinities, or, spirits, to, control, and, acquire, powers, this, concept, remained, pervasive, throughout, the, hellenistic, period, when, hellenistic, authors, categorised, a, diverse, range, of, practices, such, as, enchantment, witchcraft, incantations, divination, necromancy, and, astrology, under, the, label, magic, the, latin, language, adopted, this, meaning, of, the, term, in, the, first, century, bce, via, latin, the, concept, became, incorporated, into, christian, theology, during, the, first, century, ce, early, christians, associated, magic, with, demons, and, thus, regarded, it, as, against, christian, religion, in, early, modern, europe, protestants, often, claimed, that, roman, catholicism, was, magic, rather, than, religion, and, as, christian, europeans, began, colonizing, other, parts, of, the, world, in, the, sixteenth, century, they, labelled, the, non, christian, beliefs, they, encountered, as, magical, in, that, same, period, italian, humanists, reinterpreted, the, term, in, a, positive, sense, to, express, the, idea, of, natural, magic, both, negative, and, positive, understandings, of, the, term, recurred, in, western, culture, over, the, following, centuries, since, the, nineteenth, century, academics, in, various, disciplines, have, employed, the, term, magic, but, have, defined, it, in, different, ways, and, used, it, in, reference, to, different, things, one, approach, associated, with, the, anthropologists, edward, tylor, 1832, 1917, and, james, g, frazer, 1854, 1941, uses, the, term, to, describe, beliefs, in, hidden, sympathies, between, objects, that, allow, one, to, influence, the, other, defined, in, this, way, magic, is, portrayed, as, the, opposite, to, science, an, alternative, approach, associated, with, the, sociologist, marcel, mauss, 1872, 1950, and, his, uncle, mile, durkheim, 1858, 1917, employs, the, term, to, describe, private, rites, and, ceremonies, and, contrasts, it, with, religion, which, it, defines, as, a, communal, and, organised, activity, by, the, 1990s, many, scholars, were, rejecting, the, term, s, utility, for, scholarship, they, argued, that, the, label, drew, arbitrary, lines, between, similar, beliefs, and, practices, that, were, alternatively, considered, religious, and, that, it, constituted, ethnocentric, to, apply, the, connotations, of, magic, rooted, in, western, and, christian, history, to, other, cultures, historians, and, anthropologists, have, distinguished, between, practitioners, who, engage, in, high, magic, and, those, who, engage, in, low, magic, high, magic, also, known, as, theurgy, and, ceremonial, or, ritual, magic, is, more, complex, involving, lengthy, and, detailed, rituals, as, well, as, sophisticated, sometimes, expensive, paraphernalia, low, magic, and, natural, magic, are, associated, with, peasants, and, folklore, with, simpler, rituals, such, as, brief, spoken, spells, low, magic, is, also, closely, associated, with, sorcery, and, witchcraft, anthropologist, susan, greenwood, writes, that, since, the, renaissance, high, magic, has, been, concerned, with, drawing, down, forces, and, energies, from, heaven, and, achieving, unity, with, divinity, high, magic, is, usually, performed, indoors, while, witchcraft, is, often, performed, outdoors, historian, owen, davies, says, the, term, white, witch, was, rarely, used, before, the, 20th, century, white, magic, is, understood, as, the, use, of, magic, for, selfless, or, helpful, purposes, while, black, magic, was, used, for, selfish, harmful, or, evil, purposes, black, magic, is, the, malicious, counterpart, of, the, benevolent, white, magic, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, what, constitutes, white, gray, or, black, magic, as, phil, hine, says, like, many, other, aspects, of, occultism, what, is, termed, to, be, black, magic, depends, very, much, on, who, is, doing, the, defining, gray, magic, also, called, neutral, magic, is, magic, that, is, not, performed, for, specifically, benevolent, reasons, but, is, also, not, focused, towards, completely, hostile, practices, the, historian, ronald, hutton, notes, the, presence, of, four, distinct, meanings, of, the, term, witchcraft, in, the, english, language, historically, the, term, primarily, referred, to, the, practice, of, causing, harm, to, others, through, supernatural, or, magical, means, this, remains, according, to, hutton, the, most, widespread, and, frequent, understanding, of, the, term, moreover, hutton, also, notes, three, other, definitions, in, current, usage, to, refer, to, anyone, who, conducts, magical, acts, for, benevolent, or, malevolent, intent, for, practitioners, of, the, modern, pagan, religion, of, wicca, or, as, a, symbol, of, women, resisting, male, authority, and, asserting, an, independent, female, authority, belief, in, witchcraft, is, often, present, within, societies, and, groups, whose, cultural, framework, includes, a, magical, world, view, those, regarded, as, being, magicians, have, often, faced, suspicion, from, other, members, of, their, society, this, is, particularly, the, case, if, these, perceived, magicians, have, been, associated, with, social, groups, already, considered, morally, suspect, in, a, particular, society, such, as, foreigners, women, or, the, lower, classes, in, contrast, to, these, negative, associations, many, practitioners, of, activities, that, have, been, labelled, magical, have, emphasised, that, their, actions, are, benevolent, and, beneficial, this, conflicted, with, the, common, christian, view, that, all, activities, categorised, as, being, forms, of, magic, were, intrinsically, bad, regardless, of, the, intent, of, the, magician, because, all, magical, actions, relied, on, the, aid, of, demons, there, could, be, conflicting, attitudes, regarding, the, practices, of, a, magician, in, european, history, authorities, often, believed, that, cunning, folk, and, traditional, healers, were, harmful, because, their, practices, were, regarded, as, magical, and, thus, stemming, from, contact, with, demons, whereas, a, local, community, might, value, and, respect, these, individuals, because, their, skills, and, services, were, deemed, beneficial, in, western, societies, the, practice, of, magic, especially, when, harmful, was, usually, associated, with, women, for, instance, during, the, witch, trials, of, the, early, modern, period, around, three, quarters, of, those, executed, as, witches, were, female, to, only, a, quarter, who, were, men, that, women, were, more, likely, to, be, accused, and, convicted, of, witchcraft, in, this, period, might, have, been, because, their, position, was, more, legally, vulnerable, with, women, having, little, or, no, legal, standing, that, was, independent, of, their, male, relatives, the, conceptual, link, between, women, and, magic, in, western, culture, may, be, because, many, of, the, activities, regarded, as, magical, from, rites, to, encourage, fertility, to, potions, to, induce, abortions, were, associated, with, the, female, sphere, it, might, also, be, connected, to, the, fact, that, many, cultures, portrayed, women, as, being, inferior, to, men, on, an, intellectual, moral, spiritual, and, physical, level, magic, was, invoked, in, many, kinds, of, rituals, and, medical, formulae, and, to, counteract, evil, omens, defensive, or, legitimate, magic, in, mesopotamia, asiputu, or, masmassutu, in, the, akkadian, language, were, incantations, and, ritual, practices, intended, to, alter, specific, realities, the, ancient, mesopotamians, believed, that, magic, was, the, only, viable, defense, against, demons, ghosts, and, evil, sorcerers, to, defend, themselves, against, the, spirits, of, those, they, had, wronged, they, would, leave, offerings, known, as, kispu, in, the, person, s, tomb, in, hope, of, appeasing, them, if, that, failed, they, also, sometimes, took, a, figurine, of, the, deceased, and, buried, it, in, the, ground, demanding, for, the, gods, to, eradicate, the, spirit, or, force, it, to, leave, the, person, alone, the, ancient, mesopotamians, also, used, magic, intending, to, protect, themselves, from, evil, sorcerers, who, might, place, curses, on, them, black, magic, as, a, category, did, not, exist, in, ancient, mesopotamia, and, a, person, legitimately, using, magic, to, defend, themselves, against, illegitimate, magic, would, use, exactly, the, same, techniques, the, only, major, difference, was, that, curses, were, enacted, in, secret, whereas, a, defense, against, sorcery, was, conducted, in, the, open, in, front, of, an, audience, if, possible, one, ritual, to, punish, a, sorcerer, was, known, as, maql, or, the, burning, the, person, viewed, as, being, afflicted, by, witchcraft, would, create, an, effigy, of, the, sorcerer, and, put, it, on, trial, at, night, then, once, the, nature, of, the, sorcerer, s, crimes, had, been, determined, the, person, would, burn, the, effigy, and, thereby, break, the, sorcerer, s, power, over, them, the, ancient, mesopotamians, also, performed, magical, rituals, to, purify, themselves, of, sins, committed, unknowingly, one, such, ritual, was, known, as, the, urpu, or, burning, in, which, the, caster, of, the, spell, would, transfer, the, guilt, for, all, their, misdeeds, onto, various, objects, such, as, a, strip, of, dates, an, onion, and, a, tuft, of, wool, the, person, would, then, burn, the, objects, and, thereby, purify, themself, of, all, sins, that, they, might, have, unknowingly, committed, a, whole, genre, of, love, spells, existed, such, spells, were, believed, to, cause, a, person, to, fall, in, love, with, another, person, restore, love, which, had, faded, or, cause, a, male, sexual, partner, to, be, able, to, sustain, an, erection, when, he, had, previously, been, unable, other, spells, were, used, to, reconcile, a, man, with, his, patron, deity, or, to, reconcile, a, wife, with, a, husband, who, had, been, neglecting, her, the, ancient, mesopotamians, made, no, distinction, between, rational, science, and, magic, when, a, person, became, ill, doctors, would, prescribe, both, magical, formulas, to, be, recited, as, well, as, medicinal, treatments, most, magical, rituals, were, intended, to, be, performed, by, an, ipu, an, expert, in, the, magical, arts, the, profession, was, generally, passed, down, from, generation, to, generation, and, was, held, in, extremely, high, regard, and, often, served, as, advisors, to, kings, and, great, leaders, an, ipu, probably, served, not, only, as, a, magician, but, also, as, a, physician, a, priest, a, scribe, and, a, scholar, the, sumerian, god, enki, who, was, later, syncretized, with, the, east, semitic, god, ea, was, closely, associated, with, magic, and, incantations, he, was, the, patron, god, of, the, b, r, and, the, a, ip, and, was, widely, regarded, as, the, ultimate, source, of, all, arcane, knowledge, the, ancient, mesopotamians, also, believed, in, omens, which, could, come, when, solicited, or, unsolicited, regardless, of, how, they, came, omens, were, always, taken, with, the, utmost, seriousness, a, common, set, of, shared, assumptions, about, the, causes, of, evil, and, how, to, avert, it, are, found, in, a, form, of, early, protective, magic, called, incantation, bowl, or, magic, bowls, the, bowls, were, produced, in, the, middle, east, particularly, in, upper, mesopotamia, and, syria, what, is, now, iraq, and, iran, and, fairly, popular, during, the, sixth, to, eighth, centuries, the, bowls, were, buried, face, down, and, were, meant, to, capture, demons, they, were, commonly, placed, under, the, threshold, courtyards, in, the, corner, of, the, homes, of, the, recently, deceased, and, in, cemeteries, a, subcategory, of, incantation, bowls, are, those, used, in, jewish, magical, practice, aramaic, incantation, bowls, are, an, important, source, of, knowledge, about, jewish, magical, practices, in, ancient, egypt, kemet, in, the, egyptian, language, magic, personified, as, the, god, heka, was, an, integral, part, of, religion, and, culture, which, is, known, to, us, through, a, substantial, corpus, of, texts, which, are, products, of, the, egyptian, tradition, while, the, category, magic, has, been, contentious, for, modern, egyptology, there, is, clear, support, for, its, applicability, from, ancient, terminology, the, coptic, term, hik, is, the, descendant, of, the, pharaonic, term, heka, which, unlike, its, coptic, counterpart, had, no, connotation, of, impiety, or, illegality, and, is, attested, from, the, old, kingdom, through, to, the, roman, era, heka, was, considered, morally, neutral, and, was, applied, to, the, practices, and, beliefs, of, both, foreigners, and, egyptians, alike, the, instructions, for, merikare, informs, us, that, heka, was, a, beneficence, gifted, by, the, creator, to, humanity, in, order, to, be, weapons, to, ward, off, the, blow, of, events, magic, was, practiced, by, both, the, literate, priestly, hierarchy, and, by, illiterate, farmers, and, herdsmen, and, the, principle, of, heka, underlay, all, ritual, activity, both, in, the, temples, and, in, private, settings, the, main, principle, of, heka, is, centered, on, the, power, of, words, to, bring, things, into, being, 54, karenga, explains, the, pivotal, power, of, words, and, their, vital, ontological, role, as, the, primary, tool, used, by, the, creator, to, bring, the, manifest, world, into, being, because, humans, were, understood, to, share, a, divine, nature, with, the, gods, snnw, ntr, images, of, the, god, the, same, power, to, use, words, creatively, that, the, gods, have, is, shared, by, humans, the, interior, walls, of, the, pyramid, of, unas, the, final, pharaoh, of, the, egyptian, fifth, dynasty, are, covered, in, hundreds, of, magical, spells, and, inscriptions, running, from, floor, to, ceiling, in, vertical, columns, 54, these, inscriptions, are, known, as, the, pyramid, texts, 54, and, they, contain, spells, needed, by, the, pharaoh, in, order, to, survive, in, the, afterlife, 54, the, pyramid, texts, were, strictly, for, royalty, only, 56, the, spells, were, kept, secret, from, commoners, and, were, written, only, inside, royal, tombs, 56, during, the, chaos, and, unrest, of, the, first, intermediate, period, however, tomb, robbers, broke, into, the, pyramids, and, saw, the, magical, inscriptions, 56, commoners, began, learning, the, spells, and, by, the, beginning, of, the, middle, kingdom, commoners, began, inscribing, similar, writings, on, the, sides, of, their, own, coffins, hoping, that, doing, so, would, ensure, their, own, survival, in, the, afterlife, 56, these, writings, are, known, as, the, coffin, texts, 56, after, a, person, died, his, or, her, corpse, would, be, mummified, and, wrapped, in, linen, bandages, to, ensure, that, the, deceased, s, body, would, survive, for, as, long, as, possible, because, the, egyptians, believed, that, a, person, s, soul, could, only, survive, in, the, afterlife, for, as, long, as, his, or, her, physical, body, survived, here, on, earth, the, last, ceremony, before, a, person, s, body, was, sealed, away, inside, the, tomb, was, known, as, the, opening, of, the, mouth, in, this, ritual, the, priests, would, touch, various, magical, instruments, to, various, parts, of, the, deceased, s, body, thereby, giving, the, deceased, the, ability, to, see, hear, taste, and, smell, in, the, afterlife, the, use, of, amulets, meket, was, widespread, among, both, living, and, dead, ancient, egyptians, they, were, used, for, protection, and, as, a, means, of, reaffirming, the, fundamental, fairness, of, the, universe, the, oldest, amulets, found, are, from, the, predynastic, badarian, period, and, they, persisted, through, to, roman, times, in, the, mosaic, law, practices, such, as, witchcraft, biblical, hebrew, being, a, soothsayer, or, a, sorcerer, or, one, who, conjures, spells, or, one, who, calls, up, the, dead, are, specifically, forbidden, as, abominations, to, the, lord, halakha, jewish, religious, law, forbids, divination, and, other, forms, of, soothsaying, and, the, talmud, lists, many, persistent, yet, condemned, divining, practices, practical, kabbalah, in, historical, judaism, is, a, branch, of, the, jewish, mystical, tradition, that, concerns, the, use, of, magic, it, was, considered, permitted, white, magic, by, its, practitioners, reserved, for, the, elite, who, could, separate, its, spiritual, source, from, qlippothic, realms, of, evil, if, performed, under, circumstances, that, were, holy, q, d, and, pure, biblical, hebrew, romanized, tvmh, vthrh, the, concern, of, overstepping, judaism, s, strong, prohibitions, of, impure, magic, ensured, it, remained, a, minor, tradition, in, jewish, history, its, teachings, include, the, use, of, divine, and, angelic, names, for, amulets, and, incantations, these, magical, practices, of, judaic, folk, religion, which, became, part, of, practical, kabbalah, date, from, talmudic, times, the, talmud, mentions, the, use, of, charms, for, healing, and, a, wide, range, of, magical, cures, were, sanctioned, by, rabbis, it, was, ruled, that, any, practice, actually, producing, a, cure, was, not, to, be, regarded, superstitiously, and, there, has, been, the, widespread, practice, of, medicinal, amulets, and, folk, remedies, segullot, in, jewish, societies, across, time, and, geography, although, magic, was, forbidden, by, levitical, law, in, the, hebrew, bible, it, was, widely, practised, in, the, late, second, temple, period, and, particularly, well, documented, in, the, period, following, the, destruction, of, the, temple, into, the, 3rd, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, ce, during, the, late, sixth, and, early, fifth, centuries, bce, the, persian, magu, was, graecicized, and, introduced, into, the, ancient, greek, language, as, and, in, doing, so, it, transformed, meaning, gaining, negative, connotations, with, the, magos, being, regarded, as, a, charlatan, whose, ritual, practices, were, fraudulent, strange, unconventional, and, dangerous, as, noted, by, davies, for, the, ancient, greeks, and, subsequently, for, the, ancient, romans, magic, was, not, distinct, from, religion, but, rather, an, unwelcome, improper, expression, of, it, the, religion, of, the, other, the, historian, richard, gordon, suggested, that, for, the, ancient, greeks, being, accused, of, practicing, magic, was, a, form, of, insult, this, change, in, meaning, was, influenced, by, the, military, conflicts, that, the, greek, city, states, were, then, engaged, in, against, the, persian, empire, in, this, context, the, term, makes, appearances, in, such, surviving, text, as, sophocles, oedipus, rex, hippocrates, de, morbo, sacro, and, gorgias, encomium, of, helen, in, sophocles, play, for, example, the, character, oedipus, derogatorily, refers, to, the, seer, tiresius, as, a, magos, in, this, context, meaning, something, akin, to, quack, or, charlatan, reflecting, how, this, epithet, was, no, longer, reserved, only, for, persians, in, the, first, century, bce, the, greek, concept, of, the, magos, was, adopted, into, latin, and, used, by, a, number, of, ancient, roman, writers, as, magus, and, magia, the, earliest, known, latin, use, of, the, term, was, in, virgil, s, eclogue, written, around, 40, bce, which, makes, reference, to, magicis, sacris, magic, rites, the, romans, already, had, other, terms, for, the, negative, use, of, supernatural, powers, such, as, veneficus, and, saga, the, roman, use, of, the, term, was, similar, to, that, of, the, greeks, but, placed, greater, emphasis, on, the, judicial, application, of, it, within, the, roman, empire, laws, would, be, introduced, criminalising, things, regarded, as, magic, in, ancient, roman, society, magic, was, associated, with, societies, to, the, east, of, the, empire, the, first, century, ce, writer, pliny, the, elder, for, instance, claimed, that, magic, had, been, created, by, the, iranian, philosopher, zoroaster, and, that, it, had, then, been, brought, west, into, greece, by, the, magician, osthanes, who, accompanied, the, military, campaigns, of, the, persian, king, xerxes, ancient, greek, scholarship, of, the, 20th, century, almost, certainly, influenced, by, christianising, preconceptions, of, the, meanings, of, magic, and, religion, and, the, wish, to, establish, greek, culture, as, the, foundation, of, western, rationality, developed, a, theory, of, ancient, greek, magic, as, primitive, and, insignificant, and, thereby, essentially, separate, from, homeric, communal, polis, religion, since, the, last, decade, of, the, century, however, recognising, the, ubiquity, and, respectability, of, acts, such, as, katadesmoi, binding, spells, described, as, magic, by, modern, and, ancient, observers, alike, scholars, have, been, compelled, to, abandon, this, viewpoint, 90, 95, the, greek, word, mageuo, practice, magic, itself, derives, from, the, word, magos, originally, simply, the, greek, name, for, a, persian, tribe, known, for, practicing, religion, non, civic, mystery, cults, have, been, similarly, re, evaluated, 97, 98, the, choices, which, lay, outside, the, range, of, cults, did, not, just, add, additional, options, to, the, civic, menu, but, sometimes, incorporated, critiques, of, the, civic, cults, and, panhellenic, myths, or, were, genuine, alternatives, to, them, katadesmoi, latin, defixiones, curses, inscribed, on, wax, or, lead, tablets, and, buried, underground, were, frequently, executed, by, all, strata, of, greek, society, sometimes, to, protect, the, entire, polis, 95, 96, communal, curses, carried, out, in, public, declined, after, the, greek, classical, period, but, private, curses, remained, common, throughout, antiquity, they, were, distinguished, as, magical, by, their, individualistic, instrumental, and, sinister, qualities, 96, these, qualities, and, their, perceived, deviation, from, inherently, mutable, cultural, constructs, of, normality, most, clearly, delineate, ancient, magic, from, the, religious, rituals, of, which, they, form, a, part, 102, 103, a, large, number, of, magical, papyri, in, greek, coptic, and, demotic, have, been, recovered, and, translated, they, contain, early, instances, of, the, practice, of, magic, was, banned, in, the, late, roman, world, and, the, codex, theodosianus, 438, ad, states, if, any, wizard, therefore, or, person, imbued, with, magical, contamination, who, is, called, by, custom, of, the, people, a, magician, should, be, apprehended, in, my, retinue, or, in, that, of, the, caesar, he, shall, not, escape, punishment, and, torture, by, the, protection, of, his, rank, magic, practices, such, as, divination, interpretation, of, omens, sorcery, and, use, of, charms, had, been, specifically, forbidden, in, mosaic, law, and, condemned, in, biblical, histories, of, the, kings, many, of, these, practices, were, spoken, against, in, the, new, testament, as, well, some, commentators, say, that, in, the, first, century, ce, early, christian, authors, absorbed, the, greco, roman, concept, of, magic, and, incorporated, it, into, their, developing, christian, theology, and, that, these, christians, retained, the, already, implied, greco, roman, negative, stereotypes, of, the, term, and, extended, them, by, incorporating, conceptual, patterns, borrowed, from, jewish, thought, in, particular, the, opposition, of, magic, and, miracle, some, early, christian, authors, followed, the, greek, roman, thinking, by, ascribing, the, origin, of, magic, to, the, human, realm, mainly, to, zoroaster, and, osthanes, the, christian, view, was, that, magic, was, a, product, of, the, babylonians, persians, or, egyptians, the, christians, shared, with, earlier, classical, culture, the, idea, that, magic, was, something, distinct, from, proper, religion, although, drew, their, distinction, between, the, two, in, different, ways, for, early, christian, writers, like, augustine, of, hippo, magic, did, not, merely, constitute, fraudulent, and, unsanctioned, ritual, practices, but, was, the, very, opposite, of, religion, because, it, relied, upon, cooperation, from, demons, the, henchmen, of, satan, in, this, christian, ideas, of, magic, were, closely, linked, to, the, christian, category, of, paganism, and, both, magic, and, paganism, were, regarded, as, belonging, under, the, broader, category, of, superstitio, superstition, another, term, borrowed, from, pre, christian, roman, culture, this, christian, emphasis, on, the, inherent, immorality, and, wrongness, of, magic, as, something, conflicting, with, good, religion, was, far, starker, than, the, approach, in, the, other, large, monotheistic, religions, of, the, period, judaism, and, islam, for, instance, while, christians, regarded, demons, as, inherently, evil, the, jinn, comparable, entities, in, islamic, mythology, were, perceived, as, more, ambivalent, figures, by, muslims, the, model, of, the, magician, in, christian, thought, was, provided, by, simon, magus, simon, the, magician, a, figure, who, opposed, saint, peter, in, both, the, acts, of, the, apostles, and, the, apocryphal, yet, influential, acts, of, peter, the, historian, michael, d, bailey, stated, that, in, medieval, europe, magic, was, a, relatively, broad, and, encompassing, category, christian, theologians, believed, that, there, were, multiple, different, forms, of, magic, the, majority, of, which, were, types, of, divination, for, instance, isidore, of, seville, produced, a, catalogue, of, things, he, regarded, as, magic, in, which, he, listed, divination, by, the, four, elements, i, e, geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, and, pyromancy, as, well, as, by, observation, of, natural, phenomena, e, g, the, flight, of, birds, and, astrology, he, also, mentioned, enchantment, and, ligatures, the, medical, use, of, magical, objects, bound, to, the, patient, as, being, magical, medieval, europe, also, saw, magic, come, to, be, associated, with, the, old, testament, figure, of, solomon, various, grimoires, or, books, outlining, magical, practices, were, written, that, claimed, to, have, been, written, by, solomon, most, notably, the, key, of, solomon, in, early, medieval, europe, magia, was, a, term, of, condemnation, in, medieval, europe, christians, often, suspected, muslims, and, jews, of, engaging, in, magical, practices, in, certain, cases, these, perceived, magical, rites, including, the, alleged, jewish, sacrifice, of, christian, children, resulted, in, christians, massacring, these, religious, minorities, christian, groups, often, also, accused, other, rival, christian, groups, such, as, the, hussites, which, they, regarded, as, heretical, of, engaging, in, magical, activities, medieval, europe, also, saw, the, term, maleficium, applied, to, forms, of, magic, that, were, conducted, with, the, intention, of, causing, harm, the, later, middle, ages, saw, words, for, these, practitioners, of, harmful, magical, acts, appear, in, various, european, languages, sorci, re, in, french, hexe, in, german, strega, in, italian, and, bruja, in, spanish, the, english, term, for, malevolent, practitioners, of, magic, witch, derived, from, the, earlier, old, english, term, wicce, ars, magica, or, magic, is, a, major, component, and, supporting, contribution, to, the, belief, and, practice, of, spiritual, and, in, many, cases, physical, healing, throughout, the, middle, ages, emanating, from, many, modern, interpretations, lies, a, trail, of, misconceptions, about, magic, one, of, the, largest, revolving, around, wickedness, or, the, existence, of, nefarious, beings, who, practice, it, these, misinterpretations, stem, from, numerous, acts, or, rituals, that, have, been, performed, throughout, antiquity, and, due, to, their, exoticism, from, the, commoner, s, perspective, the, rituals, invoked, uneasiness, and, an, even, stronger, sense, of, dismissal, in, the, medieval, jewish, view, the, separation, of, the, mystical, and, magical, elements, of, kabbalah, dividing, it, into, speculative, theological, kabbalah, kabbalah, iyyunit, with, its, meditative, traditions, and, theurgic, practical, kabbalah, kabbalah, ma, asit, had, occurred, by, the, beginning, of, the, 14th, century, one, societal, force, in, the, middle, ages, more, powerful, than, the, singular, commoner, the, christian, church, rejected, magic, as, a, whole, because, it, was, viewed, as, a, means, of, tampering, with, the, natural, world, in, a, supernatural, manner, associated, with, the, biblical, verses, of, deuteronomy, 18, 9, 12, despite, the, many, negative, connotations, which, surround, the, term, magic, there, exist, many, elements, that, are, seen, in, a, divine, or, holy, light, the, divine, right, of, kings, in, england, was, thought, to, be, able, to, give, them, sacred, magic, power, to, heal, thousands, of, their, subjects, from, sicknesses, diversified, instruments, or, rituals, used, in, medieval, magic, include, but, are, not, limited, to, various, amulets, talismans, potions, as, well, as, specific, chants, dances, and, prayers, along, with, these, rituals, are, the, adversely, imbued, notions, of, demonic, participation, which, influence, of, them, the, idea, that, magic, was, devised, taught, and, worked, by, demons, would, have, seemed, reasonable, to, anyone, who, read, the, greek, magical, papyri, or, the, sefer, ha, razim, and, found, that, healing, magic, appeared, alongside, rituals, for, killing, people, gaining, wealth, or, personal, advantage, and, coercing, women, into, sexual, submission, archaeology, is, contributing, to, a, fuller, understanding, of, ritual, practices, performed, in, the, home, on, the, body, and, in, monastic, and, church, settings, the, islamic, reaction, towards, magic, did, not, condemn, magic, in, general, and, distinguished, between, magic, which, can, heal, sickness, and, possession, and, sorcery, the, former, is, therefore, a, special, gift, from, god, while, the, latter, is, achieved, through, help, of, jinn, and, devils, ibn, al, nadim, held, that, exorcists, gain, their, power, by, their, obedience, to, god, while, sorcerers, please, the, devils, by, acts, of, disobedience, and, sacrifices, and, they, in, return, do, him, a, favor, according, to, ibn, arabi, al, ajj, j, ibn, yusuf, al, shubarbuli, was, able, to, walk, on, water, due, to, his, piety, according, to, the, quran, 2, 102, magic, was, also, taught, to, humans, by, devils, and, the, angels, harut, and, marut, the, influence, of, arab, islamic, magic, in, medieval, and, renaissance, europe, was, very, notable, some, magic, books, such, as, picatrix, and, al, kindi, s, de, radiis, were, the, basis, for, much, of, medieval, magic, in, europe, and, for, subsequent, developments, in, the, renaissance, another, arab, muslim, author, fundamental, to, the, developments, of, medieval, and, renaissance, european, magic, was, ahmad, al, buni, with, his, books, such, as, the, shams, al, ma, arif, which, deal, above, all, with, the, evocation, and, invocation, of, spirits, or, jinn, to, control, them, obtain, powers, and, make, wishes, come, true, these, books, are, still, important, to, the, islamic, world, specifically, in, simiyya, a, doctrine, found, commonly, within, sufi, occult, traditions, during, the, early, modern, period, the, concept, of, magic, underwent, a, more, positive, reassessment, through, the, development, of, the, concept, of, magia, naturalis, natural, magic, this, was, a, term, introduced, and, developed, by, two, italian, humanists, marsilio, ficino, and, giovanni, pico, della, mirandola, for, them, magia, was, viewed, as, an, elemental, force, pervading, many, natural, processes, and, thus, was, fundamentally, distinct, from, the, mainstream, christian, idea, of, demonic, magic, their, ideas, influenced, an, array, of, later, philosophers, and, writers, among, them, paracelsus, giordano, bruno, johannes, reuchlin, and, johannes, trithemius, according, to, the, historian, richard, kieckhefer, the, concept, of, magia, naturalis, took, firm, hold, in, european, culture, during, the, fourteenth, and, fifteenth, centuries, attracting, the, interest, of, natural, philosophers, of, various, theoretical, orientations, including, aristotelians, neoplatonists, and, hermeticists, adherents, of, this, position, argued, that, magia, could, appear, in, both, good, and, bad, forms, in, 1625, the, french, librarian, gabriel, naud, wrote, his, apology, for, all, the, wise, men, falsely, suspected, of, magic, in, which, he, distinguished, mosoaicall, magick, which, he, claimed, came, from, god, and, included, prophecies, miracles, and, speaking, in, tongues, from, geotick, magic, caused, by, demons, while, the, proponents, of, magia, naturalis, insisted, that, this, did, not, rely, on, the, actions, of, demons, critics, disagreed, arguing, that, the, demons, had, simply, deceived, these, magicians, by, the, seventeenth, century, the, concept, of, magia, naturalis, had, moved, in, increasingly, naturalistic, directions, with, the, distinctions, between, it, and, science, becoming, blurred, the, validity, of, magia, naturalis, as, a, concept, for, understanding, the, universe, then, came, under, increasing, criticism, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, in, the, eighteenth, century, despite, the, attempt, to, reclaim, the, term, magia, for, use, in, a, positive, sense, it, did, not, supplant, traditional, attitudes, toward, magic, in, the, west, which, remained, largely, negative, at, the, same, time, as, magia, naturalis, was, attracting, interest, and, was, largely, tolerated, europe, saw, an, active, persecution, of, accused, witches, believed, to, be, guilty, of, maleficia, reflecting, the, term, s, continued, negative, associations, protestants, often, sought, to, denigrate, roman, catholic, sacramental, and, devotional, practices, as, being, magical, rather, than, religious, many, roman, catholics, were, concerned, by, this, allegation, and, for, several, centuries, various, roman, catholic, writers, devoted, attention, to, arguing, that, their, practices, were, religious, rather, than, magical, at, the, same, time, protestants, often, used, the, accusation, of, magic, against, other, protestant, groups, which, they, were, in, contest, with, in, this, way, the, concept, of, magic, was, used, to, prescribe, what, was, appropriate, as, religious, belief, and, practice, similar, claims, were, also, being, made, in, the, islamic, world, during, this, period, the, arabian, cleric, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, founder, of, wahhabism, for, instance, condemned, a, range, of, customs, and, practices, such, as, divination, and, the, veneration, of, spirits, as, sihr, which, he, in, turn, claimed, was, a, form, of, shirk, the, sin, of, idolatry, renaissance, humanism, saw, a, resurgence, in, hermeticism, and, neo, platonic, varieties, of, ceremonial, magic, the, renaissance, on, the, other, hand, saw, the, rise, of, science, in, such, forms, as, the, dethronement, of, the, ptolemaic, theory, of, the, universe, the, distinction, of, astronomy, from, astrology, and, of, chemistry, from, alchemy, there, was, great, uncertainty, in, distinguishing, practices, of, superstition, occultism, and, perfectly, sound, scholarly, knowledge, or, pious, ritual, the, intellectual, and, spiritual, tensions, erupted, in, the, early, modern, witch, craze, further, reinforced, by, the, turmoil, of, the, protestant, reformation, especially, in, germany, england, and, scotland, in, hasidism, the, displacement, of, practical, kabbalah, using, directly, magical, means, by, conceptual, and, meditative, trends, gained, much, further, emphasis, while, simultaneously, instituting, meditative, theurgy, for, material, blessings, at, the, heart, of, its, social, mysticism, hasidism, internalised, kabbalah, through, the, psychology, of, deveikut, cleaving, to, god, and, cleaving, to, the, tzadik, hasidic, rebbe, in, hasidic, doctrine, the, tzaddik, channels, divine, spiritual, and, physical, bounty, to, his, followers, by, altering, the, will, of, god, uncovering, a, deeper, concealed, will, through, his, own, deveikut, and, self, nullification, dov, ber, of, mezeritch, is, concerned, to, distinguish, this, theory, of, the, tzadik, s, will, altering, and, deciding, the, divine, will, from, directly, magical, process, in, the, sixteenth, century, european, societies, began, to, conquer, and, colonise, other, continents, around, the, world, and, as, they, did, so, they, applied, european, concepts, of, magic, and, witchcraft, to, practices, found, among, the, peoples, whom, they, encountered, usually, these, european, colonialists, regarded, the, natives, as, primitives, and, savages, whose, belief, systems, were, diabolical, and, needed, to, be, eradicated, and, replaced, by, christianity, because, europeans, typically, viewed, these, non, european, peoples, as, being, morally, and, intellectually, inferior, to, themselves, it, was, expected, that, such, societies, would, be, more, prone, to, practicing, magic, women, who, practiced, traditional, rites, were, labelled, as, witches, by, the, europeans, in, various, cases, these, imported, european, concepts, and, terms, underwent, new, transformations, as, they, merged, with, indigenous, concepts, in, west, africa, for, instance, portuguese, travellers, introduced, their, term, and, concept, of, the, feiti, aria, often, translated, as, sorcery, and, the, feiti, o, spell, to, the, native, population, where, it, was, transformed, into, the, concept, of, the, fetish, when, later, europeans, encountered, these, west, african, societies, they, wrongly, believed, that, the, fetiche, was, an, indigenous, african, term, rather, than, the, result, of, earlier, inter, continental, encounters, sometimes, colonised, populations, themselves, adopted, these, european, concepts, for, their, own, purposes, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, the, newly, independent, haitian, government, of, jean, jacques, dessalines, began, to, suppress, the, practice, of, vodou, and, in, 1835, haitian, law, codes, categorised, all, vodou, practices, as, sortil, ge, sorcery, witchcraft, suggesting, that, it, was, all, conducted, with, harmful, intent, whereas, among, vodou, practitioners, the, performance, of, harmful, rites, was, already, given, a, separate, and, distinct, category, known, as, maji, during, the, baroque, era, several, intriguing, figures, engaged, with, occult, and, magical, themes, that, went, beyond, conventional, thinking, michael, sendivogius, 1566, 1636, a, polish, alchemist, emphasized, empirical, experimentation, in, alchemy, and, made, notable, contributions, to, early, chemistry, tommaso, campanella, 1568, 1639, an, italian, philosopher, blended, christianity, with, mysticism, in, works, like, the, city, of, the, sun, envisioning, an, ideal, society, governed, by, divine, principles, jakob, b, hme, 1575, 1624, a, german, mystic, explored, the, relationship, between, the, divine, and, human, experience, influencing, later, mystical, movements, jan, baptist, van, helmont, a, flemish, chemist, coined, the, term, gas, and, conducted, experiments, on, plant, growth, expanding, the, understanding, of, chemistry, sir, kenelm, digby, known, for, his, diverse, interests, created, the, sympathetic, powder, believed, to, have, mystical, healing, properties, isaac, newton, famous, for, his, scientific, achievements, also, delved, into, alchemy, and, collected, esoteric, manuscripts, revealing, his, fascination, with, hidden, knowledge, these, individuals, collectively, embody, the, curiosity, and, exploration, characteristic, of, the, baroque, period, by, the, nineteenth, century, european, intellectuals, no, longer, saw, the, practice, of, magic, through, the, framework, of, sin, and, instead, regarded, magical, practices, and, beliefs, as, an, aberrational, mode, of, thought, antithetical, to, the, dominant, cultural, logic, a, sign, of, psychological, impairment, and, marker, of, racial, or, cultural, inferiority, as, educated, elites, in, western, societies, increasingly, rejected, the, efficacy, of, magical, practices, legal, systems, ceased, to, threaten, practitioners, of, magical, activities, with, punishment, for, the, crimes, of, diabolism, and, witchcraft, and, instead, threatened, them, with, the, accusation, that, they, were, defrauding, people, through, promising, to, provide, things, which, they, could, not, this, spread, of, european, colonial, power, across, the, world, influenced, how, academics, would, come, to, frame, the, concept, of, magic, in, the, nineteenth, century, several, scholars, adopted, the, traditional, negative, concept, of, magic, that, they, chose, to, do, so, was, not, inevitable, for, they, could, have, followed, the, example, adopted, by, prominent, esotericists, active, at, the, time, like, helena, blavatsky, who, had, chosen, to, use, the, term, and, concept, of, magic, in, a, positive, sense, various, writers, also, used, the, concept, of, magic, to, criticise, religion, by, arguing, that, the, latter, still, displayed, many, of, the, negative, traits, of, the, former, an, example, of, this, was, the, american, journalist, h, l, mencken, in, his, polemical, 1930, work, treatise, on, the, gods, he, sought, to, critique, religion, by, comparing, it, to, magic, arguing, that, the, division, between, the, two, was, misplaced, the, concept, of, magic, was, also, adopted, by, theorists, in, the, new, field, of, psychology, where, it, was, often, used, synonymously, with, superstition, although, the, latter, term, proved, more, common, in, early, psychological, texts, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, folklorists, examined, rural, communities, across, europe, in, search, of, magical, practices, which, at, the, time, they, typically, understood, as, survivals, of, ancient, belief, systems, it, was, only, in, the, 1960s, that, anthropologists, like, jeanne, favret, saada, also, began, looking, in, depth, at, magic, in, european, contexts, having, previously, focused, on, examining, magic, in, non, western, contexts, in, the, twentieth, century, magic, also, proved, a, topic, of, interest, to, the, surrealists, an, artistic, movement, based, largely, in, europe, the, surrealism, andr, breton, for, instance, published, l, art, magique, in, 1957, discussing, what, he, regarded, as, the, links, between, magic, and, art, the, scholarly, application, of, magic, as, a, sui, generis, category, that, can, be, applied, to, any, socio, cultural, context, was, linked, with, the, promotion, of, modernity, to, both, western, and, non, western, audiences, the, term, magic, has, become, pervasive, in, the, popular, imagination, and, idiom, in, contemporary, contexts, the, word, magic, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, a, type, of, excitement, of, wonder, or, sudden, delight, and, in, such, a, context, can, be, a, term, of, high, praise, despite, its, historical, contrast, against, science, scientists, have, also, adopted, the, term, in, application, to, various, concepts, such, as, magic, acid, magic, bullets, and, magic, angles, modern, western, magic, has, challenged, widely, held, preconceptions, about, contemporary, religion, and, spirituality, the, polemical, discourses, about, magic, influenced, the, self, understanding, of, modern, magicians, several, whom, such, as, aleister, crowley, were, well, versed, in, academic, literature, on, the, subject, according, to, scholar, of, religion, henrik, bogdan, arguably, the, best, known, emic, definition, of, the, term, magic, was, provided, by, crowley, crowley, who, favoured, the, spelling, magick, over, magic, to, distinguish, it, from, stage, illusionism, was, of, the, view, that, magick, is, the, science, and, art, of, causing, change, to, occur, in, conformity, with, will, crowley, s, definition, influenced, that, of, subsequent, magicians, dion, fortune, of, the, fraternity, of, the, inner, light, for, instance, stated, that, magic, is, the, art, of, changing, consciousness, according, to, will, gerald, gardner, the, founder, of, gardnerian, wicca, stated, that, magic, was, attempting, to, cause, the, physically, unusual, while, anton, lavey, the, founder, of, laveyan, satanism, described, magic, as, the, change, in, situations, or, events, in, accordance, with, one, s, will, which, would, using, normally, acceptable, methods, be, unchangeable, the, chaos, magic, movement, emerged, during, the, late, 20th, century, as, an, attempt, to, strip, away, the, symbolic, ritualistic, theological, or, otherwise, ornamental, aspects, of, other, occult, traditions, and, distill, magic, down, to, a, set, of, basic, techniques, these, modern, western, concepts, of, magic, rely, on, a, belief, in, correspondences, connected, to, an, unknown, occult, force, that, permeates, the, universe, as, noted, by, hanegraaff, this, operated, according, to, a, new, meaning, of, magic, which, could, not, possibly, have, existed, in, earlier, periods, precisely, because, it, is, elaborated, in, reaction, to, the, disenchantment, of, the, world, for, many, and, perhaps, most, modern, western, magicians, the, goal, of, magic, is, deemed, to, be, personal, spiritual, development, the, perception, of, magic, as, a, form, of, self, development, is, central, to, the, way, that, magical, practices, have, been, adopted, into, forms, of, modern, paganism, and, the, new, age, phenomenon, one, significant, development, within, modern, western, magical, practices, has, been, sex, magic, this, was, a, practice, promoted, in, the, writings, of, paschal, beverly, randolph, and, subsequently, exerted, a, strong, interest, on, occultist, magicians, like, crowley, and, theodor, reuss, the, adoption, of, the, term, magic, by, modern, occultists, can, in, some, instances, be, a, deliberate, attempt, to, champion, those, areas, of, western, society, which, have, traditionally, been, marginalised, as, a, means, of, subverting, dominant, systems, of, power, the, influential, american, wiccan, and, author, starhawk, for, instance, stated, that, magic, is, another, word, that, makes, people, uneasy, so, i, use, it, deliberately, because, the, words, we, are, comfortable, with, the, words, that, sound, acceptable, rational, scientific, and, intellectually, correct, are, comfortable, precisely, because, they, are, the, language, of, estrangement, in, the, present, day, among, some, countercultural, subgroups, the, label, is, considered, cool, according, to, anthropologist, edward, evan, evans, pritchard, magic, formed, a, rational, framework, of, beliefs, and, knowledge, in, some, cultures, like, the, azande, people, of, africa, the, historian, owen, davies, stated, that, the, word, magic, was, beyond, simple, definition, and, had, a, range, of, meanings, similarly, the, historian, michael, d, bailey, characterised, magic, as, a, deeply, contested, category, and, a, very, fraught, label, as, a, category, he, noted, it, was, profoundly, unstable, given, that, definitions, of, the, term, have, varied, dramatically, across, time, and, between, cultures, scholars, have, engaged, in, extensive, debates, as, to, how, to, define, magic, with, such, debates, resulting, in, intense, dispute, throughout, such, debates, the, scholarly, community, has, failed, to, agree, on, a, definition, of, magic, in, a, similar, manner, to, how, they, have, failed, to, agree, on, a, definition, of, religion, according, with, scholar, of, religion, michael, stausberg, the, phenomenon, of, people, applying, the, concept, of, magic, to, refer, to, themselves, and, their, own, practices, and, beliefs, goes, as, far, back, as, late, antiquity, however, even, among, those, throughout, history, who, have, described, themselves, as, magicians, there, has, been, no, common, ground, of, what, magic, is, in, africa, the, word, magic, might, simply, be, understood, as, denoting, management, of, forces, which, as, an, activity, is, not, weighted, morally, and, is, accordingly, a, neutral, activity, from, the, start, of, a, magical, practice, but, by, the, will, of, the, magician, is, thought, to, become, and, to, have, an, outcome, which, represents, either, good, or, bad, evil, ancient, african, culture, was, in, the, habit, customarily, of, always, discerning, difference, between, magic, and, a, group, of, other, things, which, are, not, magic, these, things, were, medicine, divination, witchcraft, and, sorcery, opinion, differs, on, how, religion, and, magic, are, related, to, each, other, with, respect, development, or, to, which, developed, from, which, some, think, they, developed, together, from, a, shared, origin, some, think, religion, developed, from, magic, and, some, magic, from, religion, anthropological, and, sociological, theories, of, magic, generally, serve, to, sharply, demarcate, certain, practices, from, other, otherwise, similar, practices, in, a, given, society, according, to, bailey, in, many, cultures, and, across, various, historical, periods, categories, of, magic, often, define, and, maintain, the, limits, of, socially, and, culturally, acceptable, actions, in, respect, to, numinous, or, occult, entities, or, forces, even, more, basically, they, serve, to, delineate, arenas, of, appropriate, belief, in, this, he, noted, that, drawing, these, distinctions, is, an, exercise, in, power, this, tendency, has, had, repercussions, for, the, study, of, magic, with, academics, self, censoring, their, research, because, of, the, effects, on, their, careers, randall, styers, noted, that, attempting, to, define, magic, represents, an, act, of, demarcation, by, which, it, is, juxtaposed, against, other, social, practices, and, modes, of, knowledge, such, as, religion, and, science, the, historian, karen, louise, jolly, described, magic, as, a, category, of, exclusion, used, to, define, an, unacceptable, way, of, thinking, as, either, the, opposite, of, religion, or, of, science, modern, scholarship, has, produced, various, definitions, and, theories, of, magic, according, to, bailey, these, have, typically, framed, magic, in, relation, to, or, more, frequently, in, distinction, from, religion, and, science, since, the, emergence, of, the, study, of, religion, and, the, social, sciences, magic, has, been, a, central, theme, in, the, theoretical, literature, produced, by, scholars, operating, in, these, academic, disciplines, magic, is, one, of, the, most, heavily, theorized, concepts, in, the, study, of, religion, and, also, played, a, key, role, in, early, theorising, within, anthropology, styers, believed, that, it, held, such, a, strong, appeal, for, social, theorists, because, it, provides, such, a, rich, site, for, articulating, and, contesting, the, nature, and, boundaries, of, modernity, scholars, have, commonly, used, it, as, a, foil, for, the, concept, of, religion, regarding, magic, as, the, illegitimate, and, effeminized, sibling, of, religion, alternately, others, have, used, it, as, a, middle, ground, category, located, between, religion, and, science, the, context, in, which, scholars, framed, their, discussions, of, magic, was, informed, by, the, spread, of, european, colonial, power, across, the, world, in, the, modern, period, these, repeated, attempts, to, define, magic, resonated, with, broader, social, concerns, and, the, pliability, of, the, concept, has, allowed, it, to, be, readily, adaptable, as, a, polemical, and, ideological, tool, the, links, that, intellectuals, made, between, magic, and, those, they, characterized, as, primitives, helped, to, legitimise, european, and, euro, american, imperialism, and, colonialism, as, these, western, colonialists, expressed, the, view, that, those, who, believed, in, and, practiced, magic, were, unfit, to, govern, themselves, and, should, be, governed, by, those, who, rather, than, believing, in, magic, believed, in, science, and, or, christian, religion, in, bailey, s, words, the, association, of, certain, peoples, with, magic, served, to, distance, and, differentiate, them, from, those, who, ruled, over, them, and, in, large, part, to, justify, that, rule, many, different, definitions, of, magic, have, been, offered, by, scholars, although, according, to, hanegraaff, these, can, be, understood, as, variations, of, a, small, number, of, heavily, influential, theories, the, intellectualist, approach, to, defining, magic, is, associated, with, two, british, anthropologists, edward, tylor, and, james, g, frazer, this, approach, viewed, magic, as, the, theoretical, opposite, of, science, and, came, to, preoccupy, much, anthropological, thought, on, the, subject, this, approach, was, situated, within, the, evolutionary, models, which, underpinned, thinking, in, the, social, sciences, during, the, early, 19th, century, the, first, social, scientist, to, present, magic, as, something, that, predated, religion, in, an, evolutionary, development, was, herbert, spencer, in, his, a, system, of, synthetic, philosophy, he, used, the, term, magic, in, reference, to, sympathetic, magic, spencer, regarded, both, magic, and, religion, as, being, rooted, in, false, speculation, about, the, nature, of, objects, and, their, relationship, to, other, things, tylor, s, understanding, of, magic, was, linked, to, his, concept, of, animism, in, his, 1871, book, primitive, culture, tylor, characterized, magic, as, beliefs, based, on, the, error, of, mistaking, ideal, analogy, for, real, analogy, in, tylor, s, view, primitive, man, having, come, to, associate, in, thought, those, things, which, he, found, by, experience, to, be, connected, in, fact, proceeded, erroneously, to, invert, this, action, and, to, conclude, that, association, in, thought, must, involve, similar, connection, in, reality, he, thus, attempted, to, discover, to, foretell, and, to, cause, events, by, means, of, processes, which, we, can, now, see, to, have, only, an, ideal, significance, tylor, was, dismissive, of, magic, describing, it, as, one, of, the, most, pernicious, delusions, that, ever, vexed, mankind, tylor, s, views, proved, highly, influential, and, helped, to, establish, magic, as, a, major, topic, of, anthropological, research, tylor, s, ideas, were, adopted, and, simplified, by, james, frazer, he, used, the, term, magic, to, mean, sympathetic, magic, describing, it, as, a, practice, relying, on, the, magician, s, belief, that, things, act, on, each, other, at, a, distance, through, a, secret, sympathy, something, which, he, described, as, an, invisible, ether, he, further, divided, this, magic, into, two, forms, the, homeopathic, imitative, mimetic, and, the, contagious, the, former, was, the, idea, that, like, produces, like, or, that, the, similarity, between, two, objects, could, result, in, one, influencing, the, other, the, latter, was, based, on, the, idea, that, contact, between, two, objects, allowed, the, two, to, continue, to, influence, one, another, at, a, distance, like, taylor, frazer, viewed, magic, negatively, describing, it, as, the, bastard, sister, of, science, arising, from, one, great, disastrous, fallacy, where, frazer, differed, from, tylor, was, in, characterizing, a, belief, in, magic, as, a, major, stage, in, humanity, s, cultural, development, describing, it, as, part, of, a, tripartite, division, in, which, magic, came, first, religion, came, second, and, eventually, science, came, third, for, frazer, all, early, societies, started, as, believers, in, magic, with, some, of, them, moving, away, from, this, and, into, religion, he, believed, that, both, magic, and, religion, involved, a, belief, in, spirits, but, that, they, differed, in, the, way, that, they, responded, to, these, spirits, for, frazer, magic, constrains, or, coerces, these, spirits, while, religion, focuses, on, conciliating, or, propitiating, them, he, acknowledged, that, their, common, ground, resulted, in, a, cross, over, of, magical, and, religious, elements, in, various, instances, for, instance, he, claimed, that, the, sacred, marriage, was, a, fertility, ritual, which, combined, elements, from, both, world, views, some, scholars, retained, the, evolutionary, framework, used, by, frazer, but, changed, the, order, of, its, stages, the, german, ethnologist, wilhelm, schmidt, argued, that, religion, by, which, he, meant, monotheism, was, the, first, stage, of, human, belief, which, later, degenerated, into, both, magic, and, polytheism, others, rejected, the, evolutionary, framework, entirely, frazer, s, notion, that, magic, had, given, way, to, religion, as, part, of, an, evolutionary, framework, was, later, deconstructed, by, the, folklorist, and, anthropologist, andrew, lang, in, his, essay, magic, and, religion, lang, did, so, by, highlighting, how, frazer, s, framework, relied, upon, misrepresenting, ethnographic, accounts, of, beliefs, and, practiced, among, indigenous, australians, to, fit, his, concept, of, magic, the, functionalist, approach, to, defining, magic, is, associated, with, the, french, sociologists, marcel, mauss, and, emile, durkheim, in, this, approach, magic, is, understood, as, being, the, theoretical, opposite, of, religion, mauss, set, forth, his, conception, of, magic, in, a, 1902, essay, a, general, theory, of, magic, mauss, used, the, term, magic, in, reference, to, any, rite, that, is, not, part, of, an, organized, cult, a, rite, that, is, private, secret, mysterious, and, ultimately, tending, towards, one, that, is, forbidden, conversely, he, associated, religion, with, organised, cult, by, saying, that, magic, was, inherently, non, social, mauss, had, been, influenced, by, the, traditional, christian, understandings, of, the, concept, mauss, deliberately, rejected, the, intellectualist, approach, promoted, by, frazer, believing, that, it, was, inappropriate, to, restrict, the, term, magic, to, sympathetic, magic, as, frazer, had, done, he, expressed, the, view, that, there, are, not, only, magical, rites, which, are, not, sympathetic, but, neither, is, sympathy, a, prerogative, of, magic, since, there, are, sympathetic, practices, in, religion, mauss, ideas, were, adopted, by, durkheim, in, his, 1912, book, the, elementary, forms, of, the, religious, life, durkheim, was, of, the, view, that, both, magic, and, religion, pertained, to, sacred, things, that, is, to, say, things, set, apart, and, forbidden, where, he, saw, them, as, being, different, was, in, their, social, organisation, durkheim, used, the, term, magic, to, describe, things, that, were, inherently, anti, social, existing, in, contrast, to, what, he, referred, to, as, a, church, the, religious, beliefs, shared, by, a, social, group, in, his, words, there, is, no, church, of, magic, durkheim, expressed, the, view, that, there, is, something, inherently, anti, religious, about, the, maneuvers, of, the, magician, and, that, a, belief, in, magic, does, not, result, in, binding, together, those, who, adhere, to, it, nor, in, uniting, them, into, a, group, leading, a, common, life, durkheim, s, definition, encounters, problems, in, situations, such, as, the, rites, performed, by, wiccans, in, which, acts, carried, out, communally, have, been, regarded, either, by, practitioners, or, observers, as, being, magical, scholars, have, criticized, the, idea, that, magic, and, religion, can, be, differentiated, into, two, distinct, separate, categories, the, social, anthropologist, alfred, radcliffe, brown, suggested, that, a, simple, dichotomy, between, magic, and, religion, was, unhelpful, and, thus, both, should, be, subsumed, under, the, broader, category, of, ritual, many, later, anthropologists, followed, his, example, nevertheless, this, distinction, is, still, often, made, by, scholars, discussing, this, topic, the, emotionalist, approach, to, magic, is, associated, with, the, english, anthropologist, robert, ranulph, marett, the, austrian, sigmund, freud, and, the, polish, anthropologist, bronis, aw, malinowski, marett, viewed, magic, as, a, response, to, stress, in, a, 1904, article, he, argued, that, magic, was, a, cathartic, or, stimulating, practice, designed, to, relieve, feelings, of, tension, as, his, thought, developed, he, increasingly, rejected, the, idea, of, a, division, between, magic, and, religion, and, began, to, use, the, term, magico, religious, to, describe, the, early, development, of, both, malinowski, similarly, understood, magic, to, marett, tackling, the, issue, in, a, 1925, article, he, rejected, frazer, s, evolutionary, hypothesis, that, magic, was, followed, by, religion, and, then, science, as, a, series, of, distinct, stages, in, societal, development, arguing, that, all, three, were, present, in, each, society, in, his, view, both, magic, and, religion, arise, and, function, in, situations, of, emotional, stress, although, whereas, religion, is, primarily, expressive, magic, is, primarily, practical, he, therefore, defined, magic, as, a, practical, art, consisting, of, acts, which, are, only, means, to, a, definite, end, expected, to, follow, later, on, for, malinowski, magical, acts, were, to, be, carried, out, for, a, specific, end, whereas, religious, ones, were, ends, in, themselves, he, for, instance, believed, that, fertility, rituals, were, magical, because, they, were, carried, out, with, the, intention, of, meeting, a, specific, need, as, part, of, his, functionalist, approach, malinowski, saw, magic, not, as, irrational, but, as, something, that, served, a, useful, function, being, sensible, within, the, given, social, and, environmental, context, the, term, magic, was, used, liberally, by, freud, he, also, saw, magic, as, emerging, from, human, emotion, but, interpreted, it, very, differently, to, marett, freud, explains, that, the, associated, theory, of, magic, merely, explains, the, paths, along, which, magic, proceeds, it, does, not, explain, its, true, essence, namely, the, misunderstanding, which, leads, it, to, replace, the, laws, of, nature, by, psychological, ones, freud, emphasizes, that, what, led, primitive, men, to, come, up, with, magic, is, the, power, of, wishes, his, wishes, are, accompanied, by, a, motor, impulse, the, will, which, is, later, destined, to, alter, the, whole, face, of, the, earth, to, satisfy, his, wishes, this, motor, impulse, is, at, first, employed, to, give, a, representation, of, the, satisfying, situation, in, such, a, way, that, it, becomes, possible, to, experience, the, satisfaction, by, means, of, what, might, be, described, as, motor, hallucinations, this, kind, of, representation, of, a, satisfied, wish, is, quite, comparable, to, children, s, play, which, succeeds, their, earlier, purely, sensory, technique, of, satisfaction, as, time, goes, on, the, psychological, accent, shifts, from, the, motives, for, the, magical, act, on, to, the, measures, by, which, it, is, carried, out, that, is, on, to, the, act, itself, it, thus, comes, to, appear, as, though, it, is, the, magical, act, itself, which, owing, to, its, similarity, with, the, desired, result, alone, determines, the, occurrence, of, that, result, in, the, early, 1960s, the, anthropologists, murray, and, rosalie, wax, put, forward, the, argument, that, scholars, should, look, at, the, magical, worldview, of, a, given, society, on, its, own, terms, rather, than, trying, to, rationalize, it, in, terms, of, western, ideas, about, scientific, knowledge, their, ideas, were, heavily, criticised, by, other, anthropologists, who, argued, that, they, had, set, up, a, false, dichotomy, between, non, magical, western, worldview, and, magical, non, western, worldviews, the, concept, of, the, magical, worldview, nevertheless, gained, widespread, use, in, history, folkloristics, philosophy, cultural, theory, and, psychology, the, notion, of, magical, thinking, has, also, been, utilised, by, various, psychologists, in, the, 1920s, the, psychologist, jean, piaget, used, the, concept, as, part, of, his, argument, that, children, were, unable, to, clearly, differentiate, between, the, mental, and, the, physical, according, to, this, perspective, children, begin, to, abandon, their, magical, thinking, between, the, ages, of, six, and, nine, according, to, stanley, tambiah, magic, science, and, religion, all, have, their, own, quality, of, rationality, and, have, been, influenced, by, politics, and, ideology, as, opposed, to, religion, tambiah, suggests, that, mankind, has, a, much, more, personal, control, over, events, science, according, to, tambiah, is, a, system, of, behavior, by, which, man, acquires, mastery, of, the, environment, the, magic, religion, science, triangle, developed, in, european, society, based, on, evolutionary, ideas, i, e, that, magic, evolved, into, religion, which, in, turn, evolved, into, science, however, using, a, western, analytical, tool, when, discussing, non, western, cultures, or, pre, modern, forms, of, western, society, raises, problems, as, it, may, impose, alien, western, categories, on, them, while, magic, remains, an, emic, insider, term, in, the, history, of, western, societies, it, remains, an, etic, outsider, term, when, applied, to, non, western, societies, and, even, within, specific, western, societies, for, this, reason, academics, like, michael, d, bailey, suggest, abandon, the, term, altogether, as, an, academic, category, during, the, twentieth, century, many, scholars, focusing, on, asian, and, african, societies, rejected, the, term, magic, as, well, as, related, concepts, like, witchcraft, in, favour, of, the, more, precise, terms, and, concepts, that, existed, within, these, specific, societies, like, juju, a, similar, approach, has, been, taken, by, many, scholars, studying, pre, modern, societies, in, europe, such, as, classical, antiquity, who, find, the, modern, concept, of, magic, inappropriate, and, favour, more, specific, terms, originating, within, the, framework, of, the, ancient, cultures, which, they, are, studying, alternately, this, term, implies, that, all, categories, of, magic, are, ethnocentric, and, that, such, western, preconceptions, are, an, unavoidable, component, of, scholarly, research, this, century, has, seen, a, trend, towards, emic, ethnographic, studies, by, scholar, practitioners, that, explicitly, explore, the, emic, etic, divide, many, scholars, have, argued, that, the, use, of, the, term, as, an, analytical, tool, within, academic, scholarship, should, be, rejected, altogether, the, scholar, of, religion, jonathan, z, smith, for, example, argued, that, it, had, no, utility, as, an, etic, term, that, scholars, should, use, the, historian, of, religion, wouter, hanegraaff, agreed, on, the, grounds, that, its, use, is, founded, in, conceptions, of, western, superiority, and, has, served, as, a, scientific, justification, for, converting, non, european, peoples, from, benighted, superstitions, stating, that, the, term, magic, is, an, important, object, of, historical, research, but, not, intended, for, doing, research, bailey, noted, that, as, of, the, early, 21st, century, few, scholars, sought, grand, definitions, of, magic, but, instead, focused, with, careful, attention, to, particular, contexts, examining, what, a, term, like, magic, meant, to, a, given, society, this, approach, he, noted, call, into, question, the, legitimacy, of, magic, as, a, universal, category, the, scholars, of, religion, berndt, christian, otto, and, michael, stausberg, suggested, that, it, would, be, perfectly, possible, for, scholars, to, talk, about, amulets, curses, healing, procedures, and, other, cultural, practices, often, regarded, as, magical, in, western, culture, without, any, recourse, to, the, concept, of, magic, itself, the, idea, that, magic, should, be, rejected, as, an, analytic, term, developed, in, anthropology, before, moving, into, classical, studies, and, biblical, studies, in, the, 1980s, since, the, 1990s, the, term, s, usage, among, scholars, of, religion, has, declined, many, of, the, practices, which, have, been, labelled, magic, can, be, performed, by, anyone, for, instance, some, charms, can, be, recited, by, individuals, with, no, specialist, knowledge, nor, any, claim, to, having, a, specific, power, others, require, specialised, training, in, order, to, perform, them, some, of, the, individuals, who, performed, magical, acts, on, a, more, than, occasional, basis, came, to, be, identified, as, magicians, or, with, related, concepts, like, sorcerers, sorceresses, witches, or, cunning, folk, identities, as, a, magician, can, stem, from, an, individual, s, own, claims, about, themselves, or, it, can, be, a, label, placed, upon, them, by, others, in, the, latter, case, an, individual, could, embrace, such, a, label, or, they, could, reject, it, sometimes, vehemently, economic, incentives, can, encourage, individuals, to, identify, as, magicians, in, the, cases, of, various, forms, of, traditional, healer, as, well, as, the, later, stage, magicians, or, illusionists, the, label, of, magician, could, become, a, job, description, others, claim, such, an, identity, out, of, a, genuinely, held, belief, that, they, have, specific, unusual, powers, or, talents, different, societies, have, different, social, regulations, regarding, who, can, take, on, such, a, role, for, instance, it, may, be, a, question, of, familial, heredity, or, there, may, be, gender, restrictions, on, who, is, allowed, to, engage, in, such, practices, a, variety, of, personal, traits, may, be, credited, with, giving, magical, power, and, frequently, they, are, associated, with, an, unusual, birth, into, the, world, for, instance, in, hungary, it, was, believed, that, a, t, ltos, would, be, born, with, teeth, or, an, additional, finger, in, various, parts, of, europe, it, was, believed, that, being, born, with, a, caul, would, associate, the, child, with, supernatural, abilities, in, some, cases, a, ritual, initiation, is, required, before, taking, on, a, role, as, a, specialist, in, such, practices, and, in, others, it, is, expected, that, an, individual, will, receive, a, mentorship, from, another, specialist, davies, noted, that, it, was, possible, to, crudely, divide, magic, specialists, into, religious, and, lay, categories, he, noted, for, instance, that, roman, catholic, priests, with, their, rites, of, exorcism, and, access, to, holy, water, and, blessed, herbs, could, be, conceived, as, being, magical, practitioners, traditionally, the, most, common, method, of, identifying, differentiating, and, establishing, magical, practitioners, from, common, people, is, by, initiation, by, means, of, rites, the, magician, s, relationship, to, the, supernatural, and, his, entry, into, a, closed, professional, class, is, established, often, through, rituals, that, simulate, death, and, rebirth, into, a, new, life, however, berger, and, ezzy, explain, that, since, the, rise, of, neopaganism, as, there, is, no, central, bureaucracy, or, dogma, to, determine, authenticity, an, individual, s, self, determination, as, a, witch, wiccan, pagan, or, neopagan, is, usually, taken, at, face, value, ezzy, argues, that, practitioners, worldviews, have, been, neglected, in, many, sociological, and, anthropological, studies, and, that, this, is, because, of, a, culturally, narrow, understanding, of, science, that, devalues, magical, beliefs, mauss, argues, that, the, powers, of, both, specialist, and, common, magicians, are, determined, by, culturally, accepted, standards, of, the, sources, and, the, breadth, of, magic, a, magician, cannot, simply, invent, or, claim, new, magic, in, practice, the, magician, is, only, as, powerful, as, his, peers, believe, him, to, be, throughout, recorded, history, magicians, have, often, faced, skepticism, regarding, their, purported, powers, and, abilities, for, instance, in, sixteenth, century, england, the, writer, reginald, scot, wrote, the, discoverie, of, witchcraft, in, which, he, argued, that, many, of, those, accused, of, witchcraft, or, otherwise, claiming, magical, capabilities, were, fooling, people, using, illusionism
