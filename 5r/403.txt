the, judge, and, source, of, life, and, being, eternal, and, supreme, led, european, and, muslim, writers, to, identify, tengri, as, a, deity, of, turkic, and, mongolic, peoples, according, to,

hypothesized, to, be, a, chinese, transcription, of, t, ngri, the, proto, turkic, form, of, the, word, has, been, reconstructed, as, te, ri, or, ta, r, alternatively, a, reconstructed, altaic, etymology, from, t, a, giri, oath, or, god, would, emphasize, the, god, s, divinity, rather, than, his, domain, over, the, sky, it, is, generally, assumed, the, term, tengri, originally, meant, sky, andrey, kononov, suggested, that, the, term, is, formed, by, the, words, t, n, morning, and, injir, evening, into, t, nri, referring, to, the, sky, as, whole, the, turkic, form, tengri, is, attested, in, the, 8th, century, orkhon, inscriptions, as, the, old, turkic, form, te, ri, in, modern, turkish, the, derived, word, tanr, is, used, as, the, generic, word, for, god, or, for, the, abrahamic,

tengri, possibly, a, loan, into, chinese, from, a, prehistoric, central, asian, language, however, this, proposal, is, unlikely, in, light, of, recent, reconstructions, of, the, old, chinese, pronunciation, of, the, character, such, as, q, l, i, n, zhengzhang, or, l, i, baxter, sagart, which, propose, for, a, voiceless, lateral, onset, either, a, cluster, or, single, consonant, respectively, baxter, sagart, 2014, 113, 114, pointed, to, attested, dialectal, differences, in, eastern, han, chinese, the, use, of, as, a, phonetic, component, in, phono, semantic, compound, chinese, characters, and, the, choice, of, to, transcribe, foreign, syllables, all, of, which, prompted, them, to, conclude, that, around, 200, ce, s, onset, had, two, pronunciations, coronal, t, dorsal, x, both, of, which, likely, originated, from, an, earlier, voiceless, lateral, l, linguist, stefan, georg, has, proposed, that, the, turkic, word, ultimately, originates, as, a, loanword, from, proto, yeniseian, t, gvr, high, amy, chua, renders, the, name, as, he, eternal, blue, sky, likely, because, of, the, connotations, of, the, name, s, usage, tengri, was, the, national, god, of,

the, sons, of, tengri, who, represented, him, on, earth, they, wore, titles, such, as, tengrikut, kutlu, or, kutalmysh, based, on, the, belief, that, they, attained, kut, some, sort, of, heavenly, and, spiritual, force, granted, to, these, rulers, by, tengri, prior, to, foreign, influences, the, turkic, conception, of, tengri, was, regarded, as, the, heaven, or, the, will, controlling, heaven, probably, some, sort, of, force, out, of, this, the, concept, of, a, personal, being, developed, first, when, turkic, people, took, over, other, religions, the, term, tengri, became, the, name, of, a,

god, of, the, turkic, pantheon, controlling, the, celestial, sphere, tengri, is, considered, to, be, similar, to, the, indo, european, sky, god, dyeus, and, the, structure, of, the, reconstructed,
