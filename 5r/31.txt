in, ethics, and, social, sciences, value, denotes, the, degree, of, importance, of, some, thing, or, action, with, the, aim, of, determining, which, actions, are, best, to, do, or, what, way, is, best, to, live, normative, ethics, in, ethics, or, to, describe, the, significance, of, different, actions, value, systems, are, proscriptive, and, prescriptive, beliefs, they, affect, the, ethical, behavior, of, a, person, or, are, the, basis, of, their, intentional, activities, often, primary, values, are, strong, and, secondary, values, are, suitable, for, changes, what, makes, an, action, valuable, may, in, turn, depend, on, the, ethical, values, of, the, objects, it, increases, decreases, or, alters, an, object, with, ethic, value, may, be, termed, an, ethic, or, philosophic, good, noun, sense, values, can, be, defined, as, broad, preferences, concerning, appropriate, courses, of, actions, or, outcomes, as, such, values, reflect, a, person, s, sense, of, right, and, wrong, or, what, ought, to, be, equal, rights, for, all, excellence, deserves, admiration, and, people, should, be, treated, with, respect, and, dignity, are, representatives, of, values, values, tend, to, influence, attitudes, and, behavior, and, these, types, include, ethical, moral, values, doctrinal, ideological, religious, political, values, social, values, and, aesthetic, values, it, is, debated, whether, some, values, that, are, not, clearly, physiologically, determined, such, as, altruism, are, intrinsic, and, whether, some, such, as, acquisitiveness, should, be, classified, as, vices, or, virtues, ethical, issues, that, value, may, be, regarded, as, a, study, under, ethics, which, in, turn, may, be, grouped, as, philosophy, similarly, ethical, value, may, be, regarded, as, a, subgroup, of, a, broader, field, of, philosophic, value, sometimes, referred, to, as, axiology, ethical, value, denotes, something, s, degree, of, importance, with, the, aim, of, determining, what, action, or, life, is, best, to, do, or, at, least, attempt, to, describe, the, value, of, different, actions, the, study, of, ethical, value, is, also, included, in, value, theory, in, addition, values, have, been, studied, in, various, disciplines, anthropology, behavioral, economics, business, ethics, corporate, governance, moral, philosophy, political, sciences, social, psychology, sociology, and, theology, ethical, value, is, sometimes, used, synonymously, with, goodness, however, goodness, has, many, other, meanings, and, may, be, regarded, as, more, ambiguous, social, value, is, a, concept, used, in, the, public, sector, to, cover, the, social, environmental, and, economic, impacts, of, individual, and, collective, actions, personal, values, exist, in, relation, to, cultural, values, either, in, agreement, with, or, divergence, from, prevailing, norms, a, culture, is, a, social, system, that, shares, a, set, of, common, values, in, which, such, values, permit, social, expectations, and, collective, understandings, of, the, good, beautiful, and, constructive, without, normative, personal, values, there, would, be, no, cultural, reference, against, which, to, measure, the, virtue, of, individual, values, and, so, cultural, identity, would, disintegrate, relative, values, differ, between, people, and, on, a, larger, scale, between, people, of, different, cultures, on, the, other, hand, there, are, theories, of, the, existence, of, absolute, values, which, can, also, be, termed, noumenal, values, and, not, to, be, confused, with, mathematical, absolute, value, an, absolute, value, can, be, described, as, philosophically, absolute, and, independent, of, individual, and, cultural, views, as, well, as, independent, of, whether, it, is, known, or, apprehended, or, not, ludwig, wittgenstein, was, pessimistic, about, the, idea, that, an, elucidation, would, ever, happen, regarding, the, absolute, values, of, actions, or, objects, we, can, speak, as, much, as, we, want, about, life, and, its, meaning, and, believe, that, what, we, say, is, important, but, these, are, no, more, than, expressions, and, can, never, be, facts, resulting, from, a, tendency, of, the, mind, and, not, the, heart, or, the, will, philosophic, value, may, be, split, into, instrumental, value, and, intrinsic, values, an, instrumental, value, is, worth, having, as, a, means, towards, getting, something, else, that, is, good, e, g, a, radio, is, instrumentally, good, in, order, to, hear, music, an, intrinsically, valuable, thing, is, worth, for, itself, not, as, a, means, to, something, else, it, is, giving, value, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, properties, an, ethic, good, with, instrumental, value, may, be, termed, an, ethic, mean, and, an, ethic, good, with, intrinsic, value, may, be, termed, an, end, in, itself, an, object, may, be, both, a, mean, and, end, in, itself, intrinsic, and, instrumental, goods, are, not, mutually, exclusive, categories, some, objects, are, both, good, in, themselves, and, also, good, for, getting, other, objects, that, are, good, understanding, science, may, be, such, a, good, being, both, worthwhile, in, and, of, itself, and, as, a, means, of, achieving, other, goods, in, these, cases, the, sum, of, instrumental, specifically, the, all, instrumental, value, and, intrinsic, value, of, an, object, may, be, used, when, putting, that, object, in, value, systems, which, is, a, set, of, consistent, values, and, measures, s, h, schwartz, along, with, a, number, of, psychology, colleagues, has, carried, out, empirical, research, investigating, whether, there, are, universal, values, and, what, those, values, are, schwartz, defined, values, as, conceptions, of, the, desirable, that, influence, the, way, people, select, action, and, evaluate, events, he, hypothesised, that, universal, values, would, relate, to, three, different, types, of, human, need, biological, needs, social, co, ordination, needs, and, needs, related, to, the, welfare, and, survival, of, groups, the, intensity, of, philosophic, value, is, the, degree, it, is, generated, or, carried, out, and, may, be, regarded, as, the, prevalence, of, the, good, the, object, having, the, value, it, should, not, be, confused, with, the, amount, of, value, per, object, although, the, latter, may, vary, too, e, g, because, of, instrumental, value, conditionality, for, example, taking, a, fictional, life, stance, of, accepting, waffle, eating, as, being, the, end, in, itself, the, intensity, may, be, the, speed, that, waffles, are, eaten, and, is, zero, when, no, waffles, are, eaten, e, g, if, no, waffles, are, present, still, each, waffle, that, had, been, present, would, still, have, value, no, matter, if, it, was, being, eaten, or, not, independent, on, intensity, instrumental, value, conditionality, in, this, case, could, be, exampled, by, every, waffle, not, present, making, them, less, valued, by, being, far, away, rather, than, easily, accessible, in, many, life, stances, it, is, the, product, of, value, and, intensity, that, is, ultimately, desirable, i, e, not, only, to, generate, value, but, to, generate, it, in, large, degree, maximizing, life, stances, have, the, highest, possible, intensity, as, an, imperative, there, may, be, a, distinction, between, positive, and, negative, philosophic, or, ethic, value, while, positive, ethic, value, generally, correlates, with, something, that, is, pursued, or, maximized, negative, ethic, value, correlates, with, something, that, is, avoided, or, minimized, a, protected, value, also, sacred, value, is, one, that, an, individual, is, unwilling, to, trade, off, no, matter, what, the, benefits, of, doing, so, may, be, for, example, some, people, may, be, unwilling, to, kill, another, person, even, if, it, means, saving, many, other, individuals, protected, values, tend, to, be, intrinsically, good, and, most, people, can, in, fact, imagine, a, scenario, when, trading, off, their, most, precious, values, would, be, necessary, if, such, trade, offs, happen, between, two, competing, protected, values, such, as, killing, a, person, and, defending, your, family, they, are, called, tragic, trade, offs, protected, values, have, been, found, to, be, play, a, role, in, protracted, conflicts, e, g, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, because, they, can, hinder, businesslike, utilitarian, negotiations, a, series, of, experimental, studies, directed, by, scott, atran, and, ngel, g, mez, among, combatants, on, the, isis, front, line, in, iraq, and, with, ordinary, citizens, in, western, europe, suggest, that, commitment, to, sacred, values, motivate, the, most, devoted, actors, to, make, the, costliest, sacrifices, including, willingness, to, fight, and, die, as, well, as, a, readiness, to, forsake, close, kin, and, comrades, for, those, values, if, necessary, from, the, perspective, of, utilitarianism, protected, values, are, biases, when, they, prevent, utility, from, being, maximized, across, individuals, according, to, jonathan, baron, and, mark, spranca, protected, values, arise, from, norms, as, described, in, theories, of, deontological, ethics, the, latter, often, being, referred, to, in, context, with, immanuel, kant, the, protectedness, implies, that, people, are, concerned, with, their, participation, in, transactions, rather, than, just, the, consequences, of, it, philosophical, value, is, distinguished, from, economic, value, since, it, is, independent, from, some, other, desired, condition, or, commodity, the, economic, value, of, an, object, may, rise, when, the, exchangeable, desired, condition, or, commodity, e, g, money, become, high, in, supply, and, vice, versa, when, supply, of, money, becomes, low, nevertheless, economic, value, may, be, regarded, as, a, result, of, philosophical, value, in, the, subjective, theory, of, value, the, personal, philosophic, value, a, person, puts, in, possessing, something, is, reflected, in, what, economic, value, this, person, puts, on, it, the, limit, where, a, person, considers, to, purchase, something, may, be, regarded, as, the, point, where, the, personal, philosophic, value, of, possessing, something, exceeds, the, personal, philosophic, value, of, what, is, given, up, in, exchange, for, it, e, g, money, in, this, light, everything, can, be, said, to, have, a, personal, economic, value, in, contrast, to, its, societal, economic, value, personal, values, provide, an, internal, reference, for, what, is, good, beneficial, important, useful, beautiful, desirable, and, constructive, values, are, one, of, the, factors, that, generate, behavior, besides, needs, interests, and, habits, and, influence, the, choices, made, by, an, individual, values, may, help, common, human, problems, for, survival, by, comparative, rankings, of, value, the, results, of, which, provide, answers, to, questions, of, why, people, do, what, they, do, and, in, what, order, they, choose, to, do, them, moral, religious, and, personal, values, when, held, rigidly, may, also, give, rise, to, conflicts, that, result, from, a, clash, between, differing, world, views, over, time, the, public, expression, of, personal, values, that, groups, of, people, find, important, in, their, day, to, day, lives, lay, the, foundations, of, law, custom, and, tradition, recent, research, has, thereby, stressed, the, implicit, nature, of, value, communication, consumer, behavior, research, proposes, there, are, six, internal, values, and, three, external, values, they, are, known, as, list, of, values, lov, in, management, studies, they, are, self, respect, warm, relationships, sense, of, accomplishment, self, fulfillment, fun, and, enjoyment, excitement, sense, of, belonging, being, well, respected, and, security, from, a, functional, aspect, these, values, are, categorized, into, three, and, they, are, interpersonal, relationship, area, personal, factors, and, non, personal, factors, from, an, ethnocentric, perspective, it, could, be, assumed, that, a, same, set, of, values, will, not, reflect, equally, between, two, groups, of, people, from, two, countries, though, the, core, values, are, related, the, processing, of, values, can, differ, based, on, the, cultural, identity, of, an, individual, schwartz, proposed, a, theory, of, individual, values, based, on, surveys, data, his, model, groups, values, in, terms, of, growth, versus, protection, and, personal, versus, social, focus, values, are, then, associated, with, openness, to, change, which, schwartz, views, as, related, to, personal, growth, self, enhancement, which, schwartz, views, as, mostly, to, do, with, self, protection, conservation, which, schwartz, views, as, mostly, related, to, social, protection, and, self, transcendence, which, schwartz, views, as, a, form, of, social, growth, within, this, schwartz, places, 10, universal, values, self, direction, stimulation, and, hedonism, related, to, openness, growth, achievement, and, power, related, to, self, enhancement, security, conformity, and, tradition, related, to, conservation, and, humility, benevolence, and, universalism, relate, to, self, transcendence, 523, personality, traits, using, the, big, 5, measure, correlate, with, schwartz, s, value, construct, openness, and, extraversion, correlates, with, the, values, related, to, openness, to, change, openness, especially, with, self, direction, extraversion, especially, with, stimulation, agreeableness, correlates, with, self, transcendence, values, especially, benevolence, extraversion, is, correlated, with, self, enhancement, and, negatively, with, traditional, values, conscientiousness, correlates, with, achievement, conformity, and, security, 530, men, are, found, to, value, achievement, self, direction, hedonism, and, stimulation, more, than, women, while, women, value, benevolence, universality, and, tradition, higher, 1012, the, order, of, schwartz, s, traits, are, substantially, stability, amongst, adults, over, time, migrants, values, change, when, they, move, to, a, new, country, but, the, order, of, preferences, is, still, quite, stable, motherhood, causes, women, to, shift, their, values, towards, stability, and, away, from, openness, to, change, but, not, fathers, 528, moral, foundation, theory, identifies, five, forms, of, moral, foundation, harm, care, fairness, reciprocity, in, group, loyalty, authority, respect, and, purity, sanctity, the, first, two, are, often, termed, individualizing, foundations, with, the, remaining, three, being, binding, foundations, the, moral, foundations, were, found, to, be, correlated, with, the, theory, of, basic, human, values, the, strong, correlations, are, between, conservatives, values, and, binding, foundations, individual, cultures, emphasize, values, which, their, members, broadly, share, values, of, a, society, can, often, be, identified, by, examining, the, level, of, honor, and, respect, received, by, various, groups, and, ideas, values, clarification, differs, from, cognitive, moral, education, respect, values, relate, to, the, norms, of, a, culture, but, they, are, more, global, and, intellectual, than, norms, norms, provide, rules, for, behavior, in, specific, situations, while, values, identify, what, should, be, judged, as, good, or, evil, while, norms, are, standards, patterns, rules, and, guides, of, expected, behavior, values, are, abstract, concepts, of, what, is, important, and, worthwhile, flying, the, national, flag, on, a, holiday, is, a, norm, but, it, reflects, the, value, of, patriotism, wearing, dark, clothing, and, appearing, solemn, are, normative, behaviors, to, manifest, respect, at, a, funeral, different, cultures, represent, values, differently, and, to, different, levels, of, emphasis, over, the, last, three, decades, traditional, age, college, students, have, shown, an, increased, interest, in, personal, well, being, and, a, decreased, interest, in, the, welfare, of, others, values, seemed, to, have, changed, affecting, the, beliefs, and, attitudes, of, the, students, members, take, part, in, a, culture, even, if, each, member, s, personal, values, do, not, entirely, agree, with, some, of, the, normative, values, sanctioned, in, that, culture, this, reflects, an, individual, s, ability, to, synthesize, and, extract, aspects, valuable, to, them, from, the, multiple, subcultures, they, belong, to, if, a, group, member, expresses, a, value, that, seriously, conflicts, with, the, group, s, norms, the, group, s, authority, may, carry, out, various, ways, of, encouraging, conformity, or, stigmatizing, the, non, conforming, behavior, of, that, member, for, example, imprisonment, can, result, from, conflict, with, social, norms, that, the, state, has, established, as, law, furthermore, cultural, values, can, be, expressed, at, a, global, level, through, institutions, participating, in, the, global, economy, for, example, values, important, to, global, governance, can, include, leadership, legitimacy, and, efficiency, within, our, current, global, governance, architecture, leadership, is, expressed, through, the, g20, legitimacy, through, the, united, nations, and, efficiency, through, member, driven, international, organizations, the, expertise, provided, by, international, organizations, and, civil, society, depends, on, the, incorporation, of, flexibility, in, the, rules, to, preserve, the, expression, of, identity, in, a, globalized, world, nonetheless, in, warlike, economic, competition, differing, views, may, contradict, each, other, particularly, in, the, field, of, culture, thus, audiences, in, europe, may, regard, a, movie, as, an, artistic, creation, and, grant, it, benefits, from, special, treatment, while, audiences, in, the, united, states, may, see, it, as, mere, entertainment, whatever, its, artistic, merits, eu, policies, based, on, the, notion, of, cultural, exception, can, become, juxtaposed, with, the, liberal, policy, of, cultural, specificity, in, english, speaking, countries, indeed, international, law, traditionally, treats, films, as, property, and, the, content, of, television, programs, as, a, service, consequently, cultural, interventionist, policies, can, find, themselves, opposed, to, the, anglo, saxon, liberal, position, causing, failures, in, international, negotiations, values, are, generally, received, through, cultural, means, especially, diffusion, and, transmission, or, socialization, from, parents, to, children, parents, in, different, cultures, have, different, values, for, example, parents, in, a, hunter, gatherer, society, or, surviving, through, subsistence, agriculture, value, practical, survival, skills, from, a, young, age, many, such, cultures, begin, teaching, babies, to, use, sharp, tools, including, knives, before, their, first, birthdays, italian, parents, value, social, and, emotional, abilities, and, having, an, even, temperament, spanish, parents, want, their, children, to, be, sociable, swedish, parents, value, security, and, happiness, dutch, parents, value, independence, long, attention, spans, and, predictable, schedules, american, parents, are, unusual, for, strongly, valuing, intellectual, ability, especially, in, a, narrow, book, learning, sense, the, kipsigis, people, of, kenya, value, children, who, are, not, only, smart, but, who, employ, that, intelligence, in, a, responsible, and, helpful, way, which, they, call, ng, om, luos, of, kenya, value, education, and, pride, which, they, call, nyadhi, factors, that, influence, the, development, of, cultural, values, are, summarized, below, the, inglehart, welzel, cultural, map, of, the, world, is, a, two, dimensional, cultural, map, showing, the, cultural, values, of, the, countries, of, the, world, along, two, dimensions, the, traditional, versus, secular, rational, values, reflect, the, transition, from, a, religious, understanding, of, the, world, to, a, dominance, of, science, and, bureaucracy, the, second, dimension, named, survival, values, versus, self, expression, values, represents, the, transition, from, industrial, society, to, post, industrial, society, cultures, can, be, distinguished, as, tight, and, loose, in, relation, to, how, much, they, adhere, to, social, norms, and, tolerates, deviance, tight, cultures, are, more, restrictive, with, stricter, disciplinary, measures, for, norm, violations, while, loose, cultures, have, weaker, social, norms, and, a, higher, tolerance, for, deviant, behavior, a, history, of, threats, such, as, natural, disasters, high, population, density, or, vulnerability, to, infectious, diseases, is, associated, with, greater, tightness, it, has, been, suggested, that, tightness, allows, cultures, to, coordinate, more, effectively, to, survive, threats, studies, in, evolutionary, psychology, have, led, to, similar, findings, the, so, called, regality, theory, finds, that, war, and, other, perceived, collective, dangers, have, a, profound, influence, on, both, the, psychology, of, individuals, and, on, the, social, structure, and, cultural, values, a, dangerous, environment, leads, to, a, hierarchical, authoritarian, and, warlike, culture, while, a, safe, and, peaceful, environment, fosters, an, egalitarian, and, tolerant, culture, a, value, system, is, a, set, of, consistent, values, used, for, the, purpose, of, ethical, or, ideological, integrity, as, a, member, of, a, society, group, or, community, an, individual, can, hold, both, a, personal, value, system, and, a, communal, value, system, at, the, same, time, in, this, case, the, two, value, systems, one, personal, and, one, communal, are, externally, consistent, provided, they, bear, no, contradictions, or, situational, exceptions, between, them, a, value, system, in, its, own, right, is, internally, consistent, when, conversely, a, value, system, by, itself, is, internally, inconsistent, if, abstract, exceptions, serve, to, reinforce, the, ranking, of, values, their, definitions, are, generalized, enough, to, be, relevant, to, any, and, all, situations, situational, exceptions, on, the, other, hand, are, ad, hoc, and, pertain, only, to, specific, situations, the, presence, of, a, type, of, exception, determines, one, of, two, more, kinds, of, value, systems, the, difference, between, these, two, types, of, systems, can, be, seen, when, people, state, that, they, hold, one, value, system, yet, in, practice, deviate, from, it, thus, holding, a, different, value, system, for, example, a, religion, lists, an, absolute, set, of, values, while, the, practice, of, that, religion, may, include, exceptions, implicit, exceptions, bring, about, a, third, type, of, value, system, called, a, formal, value, system, whether, idealized, or, realized, this, type, contains, an, implicit, exception, associated, with, each, value, as, long, as, no, higher, priority, value, is, violated, for, instance, a, person, might, feel, that, lying, is, wrong, since, preserving, a, life, is, probably, more, highly, valued, than, adhering, to, the, principle, that, lying, is, wrong, lying, to, save, someone, s, life, is, acceptable, perhaps, too, simplistic, in, practice, such, a, hierarchical, structure, may, warrant, explicit, exceptions, although, sharing, a, set, of, common, values, like, hockey, is, better, than, baseball, or, ice, cream, is, better, than, fruit, two, different, parties, might, not, rank, those, values, equally, also, two, parties, might, disagree, as, to, certain, actions, are, right, or, wrong, both, in, theory, and, in, practice, and, find, themselves, in, an, ideological, or, physical, conflict, ethonomics, the, discipline, of, rigorously, examining, and, comparing, value, systems, enables, us, to, understand, politics, and, motivations, more, fully, in, order, to, resolve, conflicts, an, example, conflict, would, be, a, value, system, based, on, individualism, pitted, against, a, value, system, based, on, collectivism, a, rational, value, system, organized, to, resolve, the, conflict, between, two, such, value, systems, might, take, the, form, below, added, exceptions, can, become, recursive, and, often, convoluted
