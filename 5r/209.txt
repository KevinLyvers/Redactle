occurred, five, years, prior, to, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, and, unintentionally, signified, the, beginning, of, an, effectively, independent, church, structure, in, the, moscow, north, eastern, russian, part, of, the, russian, church, subsequently, there, developed, a, theory, in, moscow, that, saw, moscow, as, the, third, rome, the, legitimate, successor, to, constantinople, and, the, primate, of, the, moscow, church, as, head, of, all, the, russian, church, meanwhile, the, newly, established, in, 1458, russian, orthodox, initially, uniate, metropolitanate, in, kiev, then, in,

half, a, dozen, dioceses, under, the, ultimate, administrative, care, of, the, patriarch, of, moscow, and, all, rus, and, later, of, the, holy, synod, of, russia, leading, to, the, significant, ukrainian, presence, in, the, russian, church, which, continued, well, into, the, 18th, century, with, theophan, prokopovich, epiphanius, slavinetsky, stephen, yavorsky, and, demetrius, of, rostov, being, among, the, most, notable, representatives, of, this, trend, the, exact, terms, and, conditions, of, the, handover, of, the, kiev, metropolis, are, a, contested, issue, in, 1700, after, patriarch, adrian, s, death, peter, the, great, prevented, a, successor, from, being, named, and, in, 1721, following, the, advice, of, theophan, prokopovich, archbishop, of, pskov, the, holy, and, supreme, synod, was, established, under, archbishop, stephen, yavorsky, to, govern, the, church, instead, of, a, single, primate, this, was, the, situation, until, shortly, after, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, at, which, time, the, local, council, more, than, half, of, its, members, being, lay, persons, adopted, the, decision, to, restore, the, patriarchate, on, 5, november, according, to, the, julian, calendar, a, new, patriarch, tikhon, was, named, through, casting, lots, the, late, 18th, century, saw, the, rise, of, starchestvo, under, paisiy, velichkovsky, and, his, disciples, at, the, optina, monastery, this, marked, a, beginning, of, a, significant, spiritual, revival, in, the, russian, church, after, a, lengthy, period, of, modernization, personified, by, such, figures, as, demetrius, of, rostov, and, platon, of, moscow, aleksey, khomyakov, ivan, kireevsky, and, other, lay, theologians, with, slavophile, leanings, elaborated, some, key, concepts, of, the, renovated, orthodox, doctrine, including, that, of, sobornost, the, resurgence, of, eastern, orthodoxy, was, reflected, in, russian, literature, an, example, is, the, figure, of, starets, zosima, in, fyodor,

under, the, title, vekhi, milestones, or, landmarks, authored, by, a, group, of, leading, left, wing, intellectuals, including, sergei, bulgakov, peter, struve, and, former, marxists, it, is, possible, to, see, a, similarly, renewed, vigor, and, variety, in, religious, life, and, spirituality, among, the, lower, classes, especially, after, the, upheavals, of, 1905, among, the, peasantry, there, was, widespread, interest, in, spiritual, ethical, literature, and, non, conformist, moral, spiritual, movements, an, upsurge, in, pilgrimage, and, other, devotions, to, sacred, spaces, and, objects, especially, icons, persistent, beliefs, in, the, presence, and, power, of, the, supernatural, apparitions, possession, walking, dead, demons, spirits, miracles, and, magic, the, renewed, vitality, of, local, ecclesial, communities, actively, shaping, their, own, ritual, and, spiritual, lives, sometimes, in, the, absence, of, clergy, and, defining, their, own, sacred, places, and, forms, of, piety, also, apparent, was, the, proliferation, of, what, the, orthodox, establishment, branded, as, sectarianism, including, both, non, eastern, orthodox, christian, denominations, notably, baptists, and, various, forms, of, popular, orthodoxy, and, mysticism, in, 1914, there, were, 55, 173, russian, orthodox, churches, and, 29, 593, chapels, 112, 629, priests, and, deacons,

and, rights, under, patriarch, aleksey, there, were, difficulties, in, the, relationship, between, the, russian, orthodox, church, and, the, vatican, especially, since, 2002, when, pope, john, paul, ii, created, a, catholic, diocesan, structure, for, russian, territory, the, leaders, of, the, russian, church, saw, this, action, as, a, throwback, to, prior, attempts, by, the, vatican, to, proselytize, the, russian, orthodox, faithful, to, become, roman, catholic, this, point, of, view, was, based, upon, the, stance, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, and, the, eastern, orthodox, church, that, the, church, of, rome, is, in, schism, after, breaking, off, from, the, orthodox, church, the, roman, catholic, church, on, the, other, hand, while, acknowledging, the, primacy, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, in, russia, believed, that, the, small, roman, catholic, minority, in, russia, in, continuous, existence, since, at, least, the, 18th, century, should, be, served, by, a, fully, developed, church, hierarchy, with, a, presence, and, status, in, russia, just, as, the, russian, orthodox, church, is, present, in, other, countries, including, constructing, a, cathedral, in, rome, near, the, vatican, there, occurred, strident, conflicts, with, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, most, notably, over, the, orthodox, church, in, estonia, in, the, mid, 1990s, which, resulted, in, unilateral, suspension, of, eucharistic, relationship, between, the, churches, by, the, roc, the, tension, lingered, on, and, could, be, observed, at, the, meeting, in, ravenna, in, early, october, 2007, of, participants, in, the, orthodox, catholic, dialogue, the, representative, of, the, moscow, patriarchate, bishop, hilarion, alfeyev, walked, out, of, the, meeting, due, to, the, presence, of, representatives, from, the, estonian, apostolic, orthodox, church, which, is, in, the, jurisdiction, of, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, at, the, meeting, prior, to, the, departure, of, the, russian, delegation, there, were, also, substantive, disagreements, about, the, wording, of, a, proposed, joint, statement, among, the, orthodox, representatives, after, the, departure, of, the, russian, delegation, the, remaining, orthodox, delegates, approved, the, form, which, had, been, advocated, by, the, representatives, of, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, the, ecumenical, see, s, representative, in, ravenna, said, that, hilarion, s, position, should, be, seen, as, an, expression, of, authoritarianism, whose, goal, is, to, exhibit, the, influence, of, the, moscow, church, but, like, last, year, in, belgrade, all, moscow, achieved, was, to, isolate, itself, once, more, since, no, other, orthodox, church, followed, its, lead, remaining, instead, faithful, to, constantinople, canon, michael, bourdeaux, former, president, of, the, keston, institute, said, in, january, 2008, that, the, moscow, patriarchate, acts, as, though, it, heads, a, state, church, while, the, few, orthodox, clergy, who, oppose, the, church, state, symbiosis, face, severe, criticism, even, loss, of, livelihood, such, a, view, is, backed, up, by, other, observers, of, russian, political, life, clifford, j, levy, of, the, new, york, times, wrote, in, april, 2008, just, as, the, government, has, tightened, control, over, political, life, so, too, has, it, intruded, in, matters, of, faith, the, kremlin, s, surrogates, in, many, areas, have, turned, the, russian, orthodox, church, into, a, de, facto, official, religion, warding, off, other, christian, denominations, that, seem, to, offer, the, most, significant, competition, for, worshipers, this, close, alliance, between, the, government, and, the, russian, orthodox, church, has, become, a, defining, characteristic, of, mr, putin, s, tenure, a, mutually, reinforcing, choreography, that, is, usually, described, here, as, working, in, symphony, throughout, patriarch, alexy, s, reign, the, massive, program, of, costly, restoration, and,

putin, s, election, in, 2012, referring, in, february, to, putin, s, tenure, in, the, 2000s, as, god, s, miracle, nevertheless, russian, inside, sources, were, quoted, in, the, autumn, 2017, as, saying, that, putin, s, relationship, with, patriarch, kirill, had, been, deteriorating, since, 2014, due, to, the, fact, that, the, presidential, administration, had, been, misled, by, the, moscow, patriarchate, as, to, the, extent, of, support, for, pro, russian, uprising, in, eastern, ukraine, also, due, to, kirill, s, personal, unpopularity, he, had, come, to, be, viewed, as, a, political, liability, in, 2018, the, moscow, patriarchate, s, traditional, rivalry, with, the, patriarchate, of, constantinople, coupled, with, moscow, s, anger, over, the, decision, to, grant, autocephaly, to,
