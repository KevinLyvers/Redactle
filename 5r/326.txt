australian, aboriginal, religion, and, mythology, is, the, sacred, spirituality, represented, in, the, stories, performed, by, aboriginal, australians, within, each, of, the, language, groups, across, australia, in, their, ceremonies, aboriginal, spirituality, includes, the, dreamtime, the, dreaming, songlines, and, aboriginal, oral, literature, aboriginal, spirituality, often, conveys, descriptions, of, each, group, s, local, cultural, landscape, adding, meaning, to, the, whole, country, s, topography, from, oral, history, told, by, ancestors, from, some, of, the, earliest, recorded, history, most, of, these, spiritualities, belong, to, specific, groups, but, some, span, the, whole, continent, in, one, form, or, another, an, australian, linguist, r, m, w, dixon, recording, aboriginal, myths, in, their, original, languages, encountered, coincidences, between, some, of, the, landscape, details, being, told, about, within, various, myths, and, scientific, discoveries, being, made, about, the, same, landscapes, in, the, case, of, the, atherton, tableland, myths, tell, of, the, origins, of, lake, eacham, lake, barrine, and, lake, euramoo, geological,

which, had, settled, to, the, bottom, of, the, craters, confirmed, the, aboriginal, myth, tellers, story, when, the, craters, were, formed, eucalyptus, forests, dominated, rather, than, the, current, wet, tropical, rainforests, dixon, observed, from, the, evidence, available, that, aboriginal, myths, regarding, the, origin, of, the, crater, lakes, might, be, dated, as, accurate, back, to, 10, 000, years, ago, further, investigation, of, the, material, by, the, australian, heritage, commission, led, to, the, crater, lakes, myth, being, listed, nationally, on, the, register, of, the, national, estate, and, included, within, australia, s, world, heritage, nomination, of, the, wet, tropical, forests, as, an, unparalleled, human, record, of, events, dating, back, to, the, pleistocene, era, since, then, dixon, has, assembled, a, number, of, similar, examples, of, australian, aboriginal, myths, that, accurately, describe, landscapes, of, an, ancient, past, he, particularly, noted, the, numerous, myths, telling, of, previous, sea, levels, including, other, volcanic, eruptions, in, australia, may, also, be, recorded, in, aboriginal, myths, including, mount, gambier, in, south, australia, and, kinrara, in, northern, queensland, the, stories, enshrined, in, aboriginal, mythology, variously, tell, significant, truths, within, each, aboriginal, group, s, local, landscape, they, effectively, layer, the, whole, of, the, australian, continent, s, topography, with, cultural, nuance, and, deeper, meaning, and, empower, selected, audiences, with, the, accumulated, wisdom, and, knowledge, of, australian, aboriginal, ancestors, back, to, time, immemorial, david, horton, s, encyclopaedia, of, aboriginal, australia, contains, an, article, on, aboriginal, mythology, observing, a, mythic, map, of, australia, would, show, thousands, of, characters, varying, in, their, importance, but, all, in, some, way, connected, with, the, land, some, emerged, at, their, specific, sites, and, stayed, spiritually, in, that, vicinity, others, came, from, somewhere, else, and, went, somewhere, else, many, were, shape, changing, transformed, from, or, into, human, beings, or, natural, species, or, into, natural, features, such, as, rocks, but, all, left, something, of, their, spiritual, essence, at, the, places, noted, in, their, stories, australian, aboriginal, mythologies, have, been, characterised, as, at, one, and, the, same, time, fragments, of, a, catechism, a, liturgical, manual, a, history, of, civilization, a, geography, textbook, and, to, a, much, smaller, extent, a, manual, of, cosmography, there, are, 900, distinct, aboriginal, groups, across, australia, each, distinguished, by, unique, names, usually, identifying, particular, languages, dialects, or, distinctive, speech, mannerisms, each, language, was, used, for, original, myths, from, which, the, distinctive, words, and, names, of, individual, myths, derive, with, so, many, distinct, aboriginal, groups, languages, beliefs, and, practices, scholars, cannot, attempt, to, characterise, under, a, single, heading, the, full, range, and, diversity, of, all, myths, being, variously, and, continuously, told, developed, elaborated, performed, and, experienced, by, group, members, across, the, entire, continent, attempts, to, represent, the, different, groupings, in, maps, have, varied, widely, the, encyclopaedia, of, aboriginal, australia, nevertheless, observes, one, intriguing, feature, is, the, mixture, of, diversity, and, similarity, in, myths, across, the, entire, continent, the, council, for, aboriginal, reconciliation, s, booklet, understanding, country, formally, seeks, to, introduce, non, indigenous, australians, to, aboriginal, perspectives, on, the, environment, it, makes, the, following, generalisation, about, aboriginal, myths, and, mythology, they, generally, describe, the, journeys, of, ancestral, beings, often, giant, animals, or, people, over, what, began, as, a, featureless, domain, mountains, rivers, waterholes, animal, and, plant, species, and, other, natural, and, cultural, resources, came, into, being, as, a, result, of, events, which, took, place, during, these, dreamtime, journeys, their, existence, in, present, day, landscapes, is, seen, by, many, indigenous, peoples, as, confirmation, of, their, creation, beliefs, the, routes, taken, by, the, creator, beings, in, their, dreamtime, journeys, across, land, and, sea, link, many, sacred, sites, together, in, a, web, of, dreamtime, tracks, criss, crossing, the, country, dreaming, tracks, can, run, for, hundreds, even, thousands, of, kilometres, from, desert, to, the, coast, may, be, shared, by, peoples, in, countries, through, which, the, tracks, pass, australian, anthropologists, willing, to, generalise, suggest, aboriginal, myths, still, being, performed, across, australia, by, aboriginal, peoples, serve, an, important, social, function, amongst, their, intended, audiences, justifying, the, received, ordering, of, their, daily, lives, helping, shape, peoples, ideas, and, assisting, to, influence, others, behaviour, in, addition, such, performance, often, continuously, incorporates, and, mythologises, historical, events, in, the, service, of, these, social, purposes, in, an, otherwise, rapidly, changing, modern, world, it, is, always, integral, and, common, that, the, law, aboriginal, law, is, something, derived, from, ancestral, peoples, or, dreamings, and, is, passed, down, the, generations, in, a, continuous, line, while, entitlements, of, particular, human, beings, may, come, and, go, the, underlying, relationships, between, foundational, dreamings, and, certain, landscapes, are, theoretically, eternal, the, entitlements, of, people, to, places, are, usually, regarded, strongest, when, those, people, enjoy, a, relationship, of, identity, with, one, or, more, dreamings, of, that, place, this, is, an, identity, of, spirit, a, consubstantiality, rather, than, a, matter, of, mere, belief, the, dreaming, pre, exists, and, persists, while, its, human, incarnations, are, temporary, aboriginal, specialists, willing, to, generalise, believe, all, aboriginal, myths, across, australia, in, combination, represent, a, kind, of, unwritten, oral, library, within, which, aboriginal, peoples, learn, about, the, world, and, perceive, a, peculiarly, aboriginal, reality, dictated, by, concepts, and, values, vastly, different, from, those, of, western, societies, aboriginal, people, learned, from, their, stories, that, a, society, must, not, be, human, centred, but, rather, land, centred, otherwise, they, forget, their, source, and, purpose, humans, are, prone, to, exploitative, behaviour, if, not, constantly, reminded, they, are, interconnected, with, the, rest, of, creation, that, they, as, individuals, are, only, temporal, in, time, and, past, and, future, generations, must, be, included, in, their, perception, of, their, purpose, in, life, people, come, and, go, but, the, land, and, stories, about, the, land, stay, this, is, a, wisdom, that, takes, lifetimes, of, listening, observing, and, experiencing, there, is, a, deep, understanding, of, human, nature, and, the, environment, sites, hold, feelings, which, cannot, be, described, in, physical, terms, subtle, feelings, that, resonate, through, the, bodies, of, these, people, it, is, only, when, talking, and, being, with, these, people, that, these, feelings, can, truly, be, appreciated, this, is, the, intangible, reality, of, these, people, aboriginal, people, observe, some, places, as, sacred, owing, to, their, central, place, in, the, mythology, of, the, local, people, in, 1926, a, british, anthropologist, specialising, in, australian, aboriginal, ethnology, and, ethnography, professor, alfred, radcliffe, brown, noted, many, aboriginal, groups, widely, distributed, across, the, australian, continent, all, appeared, to, share, variations, of, a, single, common, myth, telling, of, an, unusually, powerful, often, creative, often, dangerous, snake, or, serpent, of, sometimes, enormous, size, closely, associated, with, the, rainbows, rain, rivers, and, deep, waterholes, radcliffe, brown, coined, the, term, rainbow, serpent, to, describe, what, he, identified, to, be, a, common, recurring, myth, working, in, the, field, in, various, places, on, the, australian, continent, he, noted, the, key, character, of, this, myth, the, rainbow, serpent, is, variously, named, kanmare, boulia, queensland, tulloun, mount, isa, andrenjinyi, pennefather, river, queensland, takkan, maryborough, queensland, targan, brisbane, queensland, kurreah, broken, hill, new, south, wales, wawi, riverina, new, south, wales, neitee, yeutta, wilcannia,

kajura, carnarvon, western, australia, numereji, kakadu, northern, territory, this, rainbow, serpent, is, generally, and, variously, identified, by, those, who, tell, rainbow, serpent, myths, as, a, snake, of, some, enormous, size, often, living, within, the, deepest, waterholes, of, many, of, australia, s, waterways, descended, from, that, larger, being, visible, as, a, dark, streak, in, the, milky, way, it, reveals, itself, to, people, in, this, world, as, a, rainbow, as, it, moves, through, water, and, rain, shaping, landscapes, naming, and, singing, of, places, swallowing, and, sometimes, drowning, people, strengthening, the, knowledgeable, with, rainmaking, and, healing, powers, blighting, others, with, sores, weakness, illness, and, death, even, australia, s, bunyip, was, identified, as, a, rainbow, serpent, myth, of, the, above, kind, the, term, coined, by, radcliffe, brown, is, now, commonly, used, and, familiar, to, broader, australian, and, international, audiences, as, it, is, increasingly, used, by, government, agencies, museums, art, galleries, aboriginal, organisations, and, the, media, to, refer, to, the, pan, australian, aboriginal, myth, specifically, and, as, a, shorthand, allusion, to, australian, aboriginal, mythology, generally, a, number, of, linguists, anthropologists, and, others, have, formally, documented, another, common, aboriginal, myth, occurring, across, australia, predecessors, of, the, myth, tellers, encounter, a, mythical, exotic, most, often, english, character, who, arrives, from, the, sea, bringing, western, colonialism, either, offering, gifts, to, the, performer, s, predecessors, or, bringing, great, harm, upon, the, performer, s, predecessors, this, key, mythical, character, is, most, often, named, captain, cook, this, being, a, mythical, character, shared, with, the, broader, australian, community, who, also, attribute, james, cook, with, playing, a, key, role, in, colonising, australia, the, aboriginal, captain, cook, is, attributed, with, bringing, british, rule, to, australia, but, his, arrival, is, not, celebrated, more, often, within, the, aboriginal, telling, he, proves, to, be, a, villain, the, many, aboriginal, versions, of, this, captain, cook, are, rarely, oral, recollections, of, encounters, with, the, lieutenant, james, cook, who, first, navigated, and, mapped, australia, s, east, coast, on, hm, bark, endeavour, in, 1770, guugu, yimidhirr, predecessors, along, the, endeavour, river, did, encounter, james, cook, during, a, 7, week, period, beached, at, the, site, of, the, present, town, of, cooktown, while, the, endeavour, was, being, repaired, from, this, time, the, guugu, yimidhirr, did, receive, present, day, names, for, places, occurring, in, their, local, landscape, and, the, guugu, yimmidhir, recollect, this, encounter, the, pan, australian, captain, cook, myth, however, tells, of, a, generic, largely, symbolic, british, character, who, arrives, from, across, the, oceans, sometime, after, the, aboriginal, world, was, formed, and, the, original, social, order, founded, this, captain, cook, is, a, harbinger, of, dramatic, transformations, in, the, social, order, bringing, change, and, a, different, social, order, into, which, present, day, audiences, have, been, born, see, above, regarding, this, social, function, played, by, aboriginal, myths, in, 1988, australian, anthropologist, kenneth, maddock, assembled, several, versions, of, this, captain, cook, myth, as, recorded, from, a, number, of, aboriginal, groups, around, australia, included, in, his, assemblage, are, set, up, the, people, to, go, down, the, countryside, and, shoot, people, down, just, like, animal, they, left, them, lying, there, for, the, hawks, and, crows, so, a, lot, of, old, people, and, young, people, were, struck, by, the, head, with, the, end, of, a, gun, and, left, there, they, wanted, to, get, the, people, wiped, out, because, europeans, in, queensland, had, to, run, their, stock, horses, and, cattle, the, response, to, death, in, aboriginal, religion, may, seem, similar, in, some, respects, to, that, to, be, found, in, european, traditions, notably, in, regard, to, the, holding, of, a, ceremony, to, mark, the, death, of, an, individual, and, the, observance, of, a, period, of, mourning, for, that, individual, any, such, similarity, however, is, at, best, only, superficial, with, ceremony, and, mourning, of, some, kind, being, common, to, most, if, not, all, human, cultures, in, death, as, in, life, aboriginal, spirituality, gives, pre, eminence, to, the, land, and, sees, the, deceased, as, linked, indissolubly, by, a, web, of, subtle, connections, to, that, greater, whole, for, aboriginal, people, when, a, person, dies, some, form, of, the, persons, spirit, and, also, their, bones, go, back, to, the, country, they, were, born, in, aborigine, people, believe, that, they, share, their, being, with, their, country, and, all, that, is, within, it, so, when, a, person, dies, their, country, suffers, trees, die, and, become, scarred, because, it, is, believed, that, they, came, into, being, because, of, the, deceased, person, when, an, aboriginal, person, dies, the, families, have, death, ceremonies, called, the, sorry, business, during, this, time, the, person, is, mourned, for, days, by, the, family, and, whole, community, crying, together, and, sharing, their, grief, often, the, deceased, person, s, family, stay, in, one, room, and, mourn, together, naming, a, person, after, their, death, is, often, taboo, as, it, is, thought, that, it, could, disturb, their, spirit, photos, of, the, deceased, are, often, not, allowed, for, the, same, reason, a, smoking, ceremony, may, be, conducted, using, smoke, on, the, belongings, and, in, the, home, of, the, deceased, which, is, believed, to, aid, in, releasing, the, spirit, the, cause, of, death, often, of, a, spiritual, nature, may, be, determined, by, aboriginal, elders, ceremonies, and, mourning, periods, can, last, days, weeks, and, even, sometimes, months, depending, upon, the, social, status, of, the, deceased, person, it, is, culturally, inappropriate, for, a, non, aboriginal, person, to, contact, and, inform, the, next, of, kin, of, a, person, s, passing, when, someone, passes, away, the, family, of, the, deceased, move, out, of, their, house, and, another, family, then, moves, in, some, families, will, move, to, sorry, camps, which, are, usually, further, away, mourning, includes, the, recital, of, symbolic, chants, the, singing, of, songs, dance, body, paint, and, cuts, on, the, bodies, of, the, mourners, in, some, aboriginal, cultures, the, body, is, placed, on, a, raised, platform, for, several, months, covered, in, native, plants, or, in, a, cave, or, tree, when, only, the, bones, remain, family, and, friends, scatter, them, in, various, ways, or, place, them, in, a, special, place, many, aboriginal, people, believe, in, a, place, called, the, land, of, the, dead, this, place, was, also, commonly, known, as, the, sky, world, which, is, really, just, the, sky, as, long, as, certain, rituals, were, carried, out, during, their, life, and, at, the, time, of, their, death, the, deceased, is, allowed, to, enter, the, land, of, the, dead, in, the, sky, world, the, spirit, of, the, dead, is, also, a, part, of, different, lands, and, sites, and, then, those, areas, become, sacred, sites, this, explains, why, the, aboriginal, people, are, very, protective, of, sites, they, call, sacred, the, rituals, that, are, performed, enable, an, aboriginal, person, to, return, to, the, womb, of, all, time, which, is, dreamtime, it, allows, the, spirit, to, be, connected, once, more, to, all, nature, to, all, their, ancestors, and, to, their, own, personal, meaning, and, place, within, the, scheme, of, things, the, dreamtime, is, a, return, to, the, real, existence, for, the, aborigine, life, in, time, is, simply, a, passing, phase, a, gap, in, eternity, it, has, a, beginning, and, it, has, an, end, the, experience, of, dreamtime, whether, through, ritual, or, from, dreams, flowed, through, into, the, life, in, time, in, practical, ways, the, individual, who, enters, the, dreamtime, feels, no, separation, between, themselves, and, their, ancestors, the, strengths, and, resources, of, the, timeless, enter, into, what, is, needed, in, the, life, of, the, present, the, future, is, less, uncertain, because, the, individual, feels, their, life, as, a, continuum, linking, past, and, future, in, unbroken, connection, through, dreamtime, the, limitations, of, time, and, space, are, overcome, for, the, aboriginal, people, dead, relatives, are, very, much, a, part, of, continuing, life, it, is, believed, that, in, dreams, dead, relatives, communicate, their, presence, at, times, they, may, bring, healing, if, the, dreamer, is, in, pain, death, is, seen, as, part, of, a, cycle, of, life, in, which, one, emerges, from, dreamtime, through, birth, and, eventually, returns, to, the, timeless, only, to, emerge, again, it, is, also, a, common, belief, that, a, person, leaves, their, body, during, sleep, and, temporarily, enters, the, dreamtime, there, are, many, songlines, which, include, reference, to, the, stars, planets, and, the, moon, although, the, complex, systems, which, go, to, make, up, australian, aboriginal, astronomy, also, serve, practical, purposes, such, as, navigation, murrinh, patha, people, s, country, the, murrinh, patha, people, whose, country, is, the, saltwater, country, immediately, inland, from, the, town, of, wadeye, describe, a, dreamtime, in, their, myths, which, anthropologists, believe, is, a, religious, belief, equivalent, to, though, wholly, different, from, most, of, the, world, s, other, significant, religious, beliefs, in, particular, scholars, suggest, the, murrinh, patha, have, a, oneness, of, thought, belief, and, expression, unequalled, within, christianity, as, they, see, all, aspects, of, their, lives, thoughts, and, culture, as, under, the, continuing, influence, of, their, dreaming, within, this, aboriginal, religion, no, distinction, is, drawn, between, things, spiritual, ideal, mental, and, things, material, nor, is, any, distinction, drawn, between, things, sacred, and, things, profane, rather, all, life, is, sacred, all, conduct, has, moral, implication, and, all, life, s, meaning, arises, out, of, this, eternal, everpresent, dreaming, in, fact, the, isomorphic, fit, between, the, natural, and, supernatural, means, that, all, nature, is, coded, and, charged, by, the, sacred, while, the, sacred, is, everywhere, within, the, physical, landscape, myths, and, mythic, tracks, cross, over, thousands, of, miles, and, every, particular, form, and, feature, of, the, terrain, has, a, well, developed, story, behind, it, animating, and, sustaining, this, murrinh, patha, mythology, is, an, underlying, philosophy, of, life, that, has, been, characterised, by, stanner, as, a, belief, that, life, is, a, joyous, thing, with, maggots, at, its, centre, life, is, good, and, benevolent, but, throughout, life, s, journey, there, are, numerous, painful, sufferings, that, each, individual, must, come, to, understand, and, endure, as, he, grows, this, is, the, underlying, message, repeatedly, being, told, within, the, murrinh, patha, myths, it, is, this, philosophy, that, gives, murrinh, patha, people, motive, and, meaning, in, life, the, following, murrinh, patha, myth, for, instance, is, performed, in, murrinh, patha, ceremonies, to, initiate, young, men, into, adulthood, a, woman, mutjinga, the, old, woman, was, in, charge, of, young, children, but, instead, of, watching, out, for, them, during, their, parents, absence, she, swallowed, them, and, tried, to, escape, as, a, giant, snake, the, people, followed, her, spearing, her, and, removing, the, undigested, children, from, the, body, within, the, myth, and, in, its, performance, young, unadorned, children, must, first, be, swallowed, by, an, ancestral, being, who, transforms, into, a, giant, snake, then, regurgitated, before, being, accepted, as, young, adults, with, all, the, rights, and, privileges, of, young, adults, pintupi, people, s, country, scholars, of, the, pintupi, peoples, from, within, australia, s, gibson, desert, region, believe, they, have, a, predominantly, mythic, form, of, consciousness, within, which, events, occur, and, are, explained, by, the, preordained, social, structures, and, orders, told, of, sung, about, and, performed, within, their, superhuman, mythology, rather, than, by, reference, to, the, possible, accumulated, political, actions, decisions, and,
