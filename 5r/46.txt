inferences, are, steps, in, reasoning, moving, from, premises, to, logical, consequences, etymologically, the, word, infer, means, to, carry, forward, inference, is, theoretically, traditionally, divided, into, deduction, and, induction, a, distinction, that, in, europe, dates, at, least, to, aristotle, 300s, bce, deduction, is, inference, deriving, logical, conclusions, from, premises, known, or, assumed, to, be, true, with, the, laws, of, valid, inference, being, studied, in, logic, induction, is, inference, from, particular, evidence, to, a, universal, conclusion, a, third, type, of, inference, is, sometimes, distinguished, notably, by, charles, sanders, peirce, contradistinguishing, abduction, from, induction, various, fields, study, how, inference, is, done, in, practice, human, inference, i, e, how, humans, draw, conclusions, is, traditionally, studied, within, the, fields, of, logic, argumentation, studies, and, cognitive, psychology, artificial, intelligence, researchers, develop, automated, inference, systems, to, emulate, human, inference, statistical, inference, uses, mathematics, to, draw, conclusions, in, the, presence, of, uncertainty, this, generalizes, deterministic, reasoning, with, the, absence, of, uncertainty, as, a, special, case, statistical, inference, uses, quantitative, or, qualitative, categorical, data, which, may, be, subject, to, random, variations, the, process, by, which, a, conclusion, is, inferred, from, multiple, observations, is, called, inductive, reasoning, the, conclusion, may, be, correct, or, incorrect, or, correct, to, within, a, certain, degree, of, accuracy, or, correct, in, certain, situations, conclusions, inferred, from, multiple, observations, may, be, tested, by, additional, observations, this, definition, is, disputable, due, to, its, lack, of, clarity, ref, oxford, english, dictionary, induction, 3, logic, the, inference, of, a, general, law, from, particular, instances, the, definition, given, thus, applies, only, when, the, conclusion, is, general, two, possible, definitions, of, inference, are, ancient, greek, philosophers, defined, a, number, of, syllogisms, correct, three, part, inferences, that, can, be, used, as, building, blocks, for, more, complex, reasoning, we, begin, with, a, famous, example, the, reader, can, check, that, the, premises, and, conclusion, are, true, but, logic, is, concerned, with, inference, does, the, truth, of, the, conclusion, follow, from, that, of, the, premises, the, validity, of, an, inference, depends, on, the, form, of, the, inference, that, is, the, word, valid, does, not, refer, to, the, truth, of, the, premises, or, the, conclusion, but, rather, to, the, form, of, the, inference, an, inference, can, be, valid, even, if, the, parts, are, false, and, can, be, invalid, even, if, some, parts, are, true, but, a, valid, form, with, true, premises, will, always, have, a, true, conclusion, for, example, consider, the, form, of, the, following, symbological, track, if, the, premises, are, true, then, the, conclusion, is, necessarily, true, too, now, we, turn, to, an, invalid, form, to, show, that, this, form, is, invalid, we, demonstrate, how, it, can, lead, from, true, premises, to, a, false, conclusion, a, valid, argument, with, a, false, premise, may, lead, to, a, false, conclusion, this, and, the, following, examples, do, not, follow, the, greek, syllogism, when, a, valid, argument, is, used, to, derive, a, false, conclusion, from, a, false, premise, the, inference, is, valid, because, it, follows, the, form, of, a, correct, inference, a, valid, argument, can, also, be, used, to, derive, a, true, conclusion, from, a, false, premise, in, this, case, we, have, one, false, premise, and, one, true, premise, where, a, true, conclusion, has, been, inferred, evidence, it, is, the, early, 1950s, and, you, are, an, american, stationed, in, the, soviet, union, you, read, in, the, moscow, newspaper, that, a, soccer, team, from, a, small, city, in, siberia, starts, winning, game, after, game, the, team, even, defeats, the, moscow, team, inference, the, small, city, in, siberia, is, not, a, small, city, anymore, the, soviets, are, working, on, their, own, nuclear, or, high, value, secret, weapons, program, knowns, the, soviet, union, is, a, command, economy, people, and, material, are, told, where, to, go, and, what, to, do, the, small, city, was, remote, and, historically, had, never, distinguished, itself, its, soccer, season, was, typically, short, because, of, the, weather, explanation, in, a, command, economy, people, and, material, are, moved, where, they, are, needed, large, cities, might, field, good, teams, due, to, the, greater, availability, of, high, quality, players, and, teams, that, can, practice, longer, possibly, due, to, sunnier, weather, and, better, facilities, can, reasonably, be, expected, to, be, better, in, addition, you, put, your, best, and, brightest, in, places, where, they, can, do, the, most, good, such, as, on, high, value, weapons, programs, it, is, an, anomaly, for, a, small, city, to, field, such, a, good, team, the, anomaly, indirectly, described, a, condition, by, which, the, observer, inferred, a, new, meaningful, pattern, that, the, small, city, was, no, longer, small, why, would, you, put, a, large, city, of, your, best, and, brightest, in, the, middle, of, nowhere, to, hide, them, of, course, an, incorrect, inference, is, known, as, a, fallacy, philosophers, who, study, informal, logic, have, compiled, large, lists, of, them, and, cognitive, psychologists, have, documented, many, biases, in, human, reasoning, that, favor, incorrect, reasoning, ai, systems, first, provided, automated, logical, inference, and, these, were, once, extremely, popular, research, topics, leading, to, industrial, applications, under, the, form, of, expert, systems, and, later, business, rule, engines, more, recent, work, on, automated, theorem, proving, has, had, a, stronger, basis, in, formal, logic, an, inference, system, s, job, is, to, extend, a, knowledge, base, automatically, the, knowledge, base, kb, is, a, set, of, propositions, that, represent, what, the, system, knows, about, the, world, several, techniques, can, be, used, by, that, system, to, extend, kb, by, means, of, valid, inferences, an, additional, requirement, is, that, the, conclusions, the, system, arrives, at, are, relevant, to, its, task, additionally, the, term, inference, has, also, been, applied, to, the, process, of, generating, predictions, from, trained, neural, networks, in, this, context, an, inference, engine, refers, to, the, system, or, hardware, performing, these, operations, this, type, of, inference, is, widely, used, in, applications, ranging, from, image, recognition, to, natural, language, processing, prolog, for, programming, in, logic, is, a, programming, language, based, on, a, subset, of, predicate, calculus, its, main, job, is, to, check, whether, a, certain, proposition, can, be, inferred, from, a, kb, knowledge, base, using, an, algorithm, called, backward, chaining, let, us, return, to, our, socrates, syllogism, we, enter, into, our, knowledge, base, the, following, piece, of, code, here, can, be, read, as, if, generally, if, p, displaystyle, to, q, if, p, then, q, then, in, prolog, we, would, code, q, p, q, if, p, this, states, that, all, men, are, mortal, and, that, socrates, is, a, man, now, we, can, ask, the, prolog, system, about, socrates, where, signifies, a, query, can, mortal, socrates, be, deduced, from, the, kb, using, the, rules, gives, the, answer, yes, on, the, other, hand, asking, the, prolog, system, the, following, gives, the, answer, no, this, is, because, prolog, does, not, know, anything, about, plato, and, hence, defaults, to, any, property, about, plato, being, false, the, so, called, closed, world, assumption, finally, mortal, x, is, anything, mortal, would, result, in, yes, and, in, some, implementations, yes, x, socrates, prolog, can, be, used, for, vastly, more, complicated, inference, tasks, see, the, corresponding, article, for, further, examples, recently, automatic, reasoners, found, in, semantic, web, a, new, field, of, application, being, based, upon, description, logic, knowledge, expressed, using, one, variant, of, owl, can, be, logically, processed, i, e, inferences, can, be, made, upon, it, philosophers, and, scientists, who, follow, the, bayesian, framework, for, inference, use, the, mathematical, rules, of, probability, to, find, this, best, explanation, the, bayesian, view, has, a, number, of, desirable, features, one, of, them, is, that, it, embeds, deductive, certain, logic, as, a, subset, this, prompts, some, writers, to, call, bayesian, probability, probability, logic, following, e, t, jaynes, bayesians, identify, probabilities, with, degrees, of, beliefs, with, certainly, true, propositions, having, probability, 1, and, certainly, false, propositions, having, probability, 0, to, say, that, it, s, going, to, rain, tomorrow, has, a, 0, 9, probability, is, to, say, that, you, consider, the, possibility, of, rain, tomorrow, as, extremely, likely, through, the, rules, of, probability, the, probability, of, a, conclusion, and, of, alternatives, can, be, calculated, the, best, explanation, is, most, often, identified, with, the, most, probable, see, bayesian, decision, theory, a, central, rule, of, bayesian, inference, is, bayes, theorem, a, relation, of, inference, is, monotonic, if, the, addition, of, premises, does, not, undermine, previously, reached, conclusions, otherwise, the, relation, is, non, monotonic, deductive, inference, is, monotonic, if, a, conclusion, is, reached, on, the, basis, of, a, certain, set, of, premises, then, that, conclusion, still, holds, if, more, premises, are, added, by, contrast, everyday, reasoning, is, mostly, non, monotonic, because, it, involves, risk, we, jump, to, conclusions, from, deductively, insufficient, premises, we, know, when, it, is, worth, or, even, necessary, e, g, in, medical, diagnosis, to, take, the, risk, yet, we, are, also, aware, that, such, inference, is, defeasible, that, new, information, may, undermine, old, conclusions, various, kinds, of, defeasible, but, remarkably, successful, inference, have, traditionally, captured, the, attention, of, philosophers, theories, of, induction, peirce, s, theory, of, abduction, inference, to, the, best, explanation, etc, more, recently, logicians, have, begun, to, approach, the, phenomenon, from, a, formal, point, of, view, the, result, is, a, large, body, of, theories, at, the, interface, of, philosophy, logic, and,
