the, aztec, religion, is, a, polytheistic, and, monistic, pantheism, in, which, the, nahua, concept, of, teotl, was, construed, as, the, supreme, god, ometeotl, as, well, as, a, diverse, pantheon, of, lesser, gods, and, manifestations, of, nature, the, popular, religion, tended, to, embrace, the, mythological, and, polytheistic, aspects, and, the, aztec, empire, s, state, religion, sponsored, both, the, monism, of, the, upper, classes, and, the, popular, heterodoxies, the, most, important, deities, were, worshiped, by, priests, in, tenochtitlan, particularly, tlaloc, and, the, god, of, the, mexica, huitzilopochtli, whose, shrines, were, located, on, templo, mayor, their, priests, would, receive, special, dispensation, from, the, empire, when, other, states, were, conquered, the, empire, would, often, incorporate, practices, from, its, new, territories, into, the, mainstream, religion, in, common, with, many, other, indigenous, mesoamerican, civilizations, the, aztecs, put, great, ritual, emphasis, on, calendrics, and, scheduled, festivals, government, ceremonies, and, even, war, around, key, transition, dates, in, the, aztec, calendar, public, ritual, practices, could, involve, food, storytelling, and, dance, as, well, as, ceremonial, warfare, the, mesoamerican, ballgame, and, human, sacrifice, the, cosmology, of, aztec, religion, divides, the, world, into, thirteen, heavens, and, nine, earthly, layers, or, netherworlds, the, first, heaven, overlaps, with, the, first, terrestrial, layer, so, that, heaven, and, the, terrestrial, layers, meet, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, each, level, is, associated, with, a, specific, set, of, deities, and, astronomical, objects, the, most, important, celestial, entities, in, aztec, religion, are, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, planet, venus, as, both, morning, star, and, evening, star, after, the, spanish, conquest, aztec, people, were, forced, to, convert, to, catholicism, aztec, religion, syncretized, with, catholicism, this, syncretism, is, evidenced, by, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, and, the, day, of, the, dead, nahua, metaphysics, centers, around, teotl, a, single, dynamic, vivifying, eternally, self, generating, and, self, regenerating, sacred, power, energy, or, force, this, is, conceptualized, in, a, kind, of, monistic, pantheism, as, manifest, in, the, supreme, god, ometeotl, as, well, as, a, large, pantheon, of, lesser, gods, and, idealizations, of, natural, phenomena, such, as, stars, and, fire, priests, and, educated, upper, classes, held, more, monistic, views, while, the, popular, religion, of, the, uneducated, tended, to, embrace, the, polytheistic, and, mythological, aspects, teotl, is, sometimes, translated, as, god, but, it, held, more, abstract, aspects, of, divinity, or, supernatural, energy, akin, to, the, polynesian, concept, of, mana, in, first, contact, with, the, spanish, prior, to, the, conquest, emperor, moctezuma, ii, and, the, aztecs, generally, referred, to, cort, s, and, the, conquistadors, as, teotl, some, historians, interpret, this, to, mean, that, the, aztecs, believed, them, to, be, gods, but, a, better, understanding, of, teotl, suggests, that, they, were, being, referred, to, as, mysterious, or, inexplicable, the, aztecs, would, often, adopt, gods, from, different, cultures, and, allow, them, to, be, worshiped, as, part, of, their, pantheon, for, example, the, fertility, god, xipe, totec, was, originally, a, god, of, the, yopi, the, nahuatl, name, of, the, tlapanec, people, but, became, an, integrated, part, of, the, aztec, belief, system, further, sometimes, foreign, gods, would, be, identified, with, an, already, existing, god, other, deities, such, as, tezcatlipoca, and, quetzalcoatl, had, roots, in, earlier, civilizations, of, mesoamerica, and, were, worshiped, by, many, cultures, under, different, names, the, many, gods, of, the, aztecs, can, be, grouped, into, complexes, related, to, different, themes, some, were, associated, with, aspects, of, nature, such, as, tlaloc, and, quetzalcoatl, and, other, gods, were, associated, with, specific, trades, reflecting, the, complexity, of, ritual, in, aztec, society, there, were, deities, related, to, pulque, a, sacred, alcoholic, beverage, but, also, deities, of, drunkenness, excess, fun, and, games, many, gods, had, multiple, aspects, with, different, names, where, each, name, highlighted, a, specific, function, or, trait, of, the, god, occasionally, two, distinct, gods, were, conflated, into, one, and, quite, often, deities, transformed, into, one, another, within, a, single, story, aztec, images, sometimes, combined, attributes, of, several, divinities, aztec, scholar, h, b, nicholson, 1971, classed, the, gods, into, three, groups, according, to, their, conceptual, meaning, in, general, mesoamerican, religion, the, first, group, he, called, the, celestial, creativity, divine, paternalism, group, the, second, the, earth, mother, gods, the, pulque, gods, and, xipe, totec, the, third, group, the, war, sacrifice, sanguinary, nourishment, group, contained, such, gods, as, ometochtli, huitzilopochtli, mictlantecuhtli, and, mixcoatl, a, more, specific, classification, based, upon, the, functional, attributes, of, the, deities, is, as, follows, cultural, god, nature, gods, gods, of, creation, lords, of, the, night, lords, of, the, day, gods, of, pulque, and, excess, gods, of, maize, and, fertility, gods, of, death, and, the, underworld, trade, gods, religion, was, part, of, all, levels, of, aztec, society, on, the, state, level, religion, was, controlled, by, the, tlatoani, and, the, high, priests, governing, the, main, temples, in, the, ceremonial, precinct, of, the, aztec, capital, of, tenochtitlan, this, level, involved, the, large, monthly, festivals, and, a, number, of, specific, rituals, centered, around, the, ruler, dynasty, and, attempted, to, stabilize, both, the, political, and, cosmic, systems, these, rituals, were, the, ones, that, involved, a, sacrifice, of, humans, one, of, these, rituals, was, the, feast, of, huey, tozoztli, when, the, ruler, himself, ascended, mount, tlaloc, and, engaged, in, autosacrifice, in, order, to, petition, the, rains, throughout, society, each, level, had, their, own, rituals, and, deities, and, played, their, part, in, the, larger, rituals, of, the, community, for, example, the, class, of, pochteca, merchants, were, involved, in, the, feast, tlaxochimaco, where, the, merchant, deity, would, be, celebrated, and, slaves, bought, on, specific, slave, markets, by, long, distance, traders, would, be, sacrificed, on, the, feast, of, ochpaniztli, all, commoners, participated, in, sweeping, the, streets, afterwards, they, also, undertook, ritual, bathing, the, most, spectacular, ritual, was, the, new, fire, ceremony, which, took, place, every, 52, years, and, involved, every, citizen, of, the, aztec, realm, during, this, commoners, would, destroy, house, utensils, quench, all, fires, and, receive, new, fire, from, the, bonfire, on, top, of, mt, huixachtlan, lit, on, the, chest, of, a, sacrificed, person, by, the, high, priests, women, were, also, a, vital, part, of, aztec, society, and, religion, many, women, had, the, right, to, land, and, the, ability, to, vote, on, important, issues, the, aztec, deities, also, reflected, this, as, many, of, the, essential, deities, were, women, in, the, nahuatl, language, the, word, for, priest, was, teopixqui, meaning, god, guard, these, men, were, seen, as, prominent, leaders, of, the, community, who, taught, various, ideas, and, morals, to, the, public, tlamacazqui, the, giver, of, things, ensured, that, the, gods, were, given, their, due, in, the, form, of, offerings, ceremonies, and, sacrifices, the, tlatoani, of, tenochtitlan, was, the, head, of, the, cult, of, huitzilopochtli, and, of, the, state, religion, of, the, aztec, empire, he, had, special, priestly, duties, in, different, rituals, on, the, state, level, however, the, aztec, religious, organization, was, not, entirely, under, his, authority, bernardino, de, sahag, n, and, duran, describe, the, pairs, of, high, priests, q, uetzalcoatlus, who, were, in, charge, of, the, major, pilgrimage, centres, cholula, and, tenochtitlan, as, enjoying, immense, respect, from, all, levels, of, aztec, society, akin, to, archbishops, and, a, level, of, authority, that, partly, transcended, national, boundaries, under, these, religious, heads, were, many, tiers, of, priests, priestesses, novices, nuns, and, monks, some, part, time, who, ran, the, cults, of, the, various, gods, and, goddesses, sahag, n, reports, that, the, priests, had, very, strict, training, and, had, to, live, very, austere, and, ethical, lives, involving, prolonged, vigils, fasts, and, penances, for, instance, they, often, had, to, bleed, themselves, and, undertake, prescribed, self, mortifications, in, the, buildup, to, sacrificial, rites, additionally, sahag, n, refers, to, classes, of, religious, specialists, not, affiliated, with, the, established, priesthood, this, included, wandering, curers, black, magicians, and, other, occultists, of, which, the, aztecs, identified, many, types, most, of, which, they, feared, and, hermits, finally, the, military, orders, professions, e, g, traders, pochteca, and, wards, calpulli, each, operated, their, own, lodge, dedicated, to, their, specific, god, the, heads, of, these, lodges, although, not, full, time, religious, specialists, had, some, ritual, and, moral, duties, duran, also, describes, lodge, members, as, having, the, responsibility, of, raising, sufficient, goods, to, host, the, festivals, of, their, specific, patron, deity, this, included, annually, obtaining, and, training, a, suitable, slave, or, captive, to, represent, and, die, as, the, image, of, their, deity, in, that, festival, aztec, temples, were, basically, offering, mounds, solid, pyramidal, structures, crammed, with, special, soils, sacrifices, treasures, and, other, offerings, buildings, around, the, base, of, the, pyramid, and, sometimes, a, small, chamber, under, the, pyramid, stored, ritual, items, and, provided, lodgings, and, staging, for, priests, dancers, and, temple, orchestras, the, pyramids, were, buried, under, a, new, surface, every, several, years, especially, every, 52, years, the, aztec, century, thus, the, pyramid, temples, of, important, deities, constantly, grew, in, size, in, front, of, every, major, temple, lay, a, large, plaza, this, sometimes, held, important, ritual, platforms, such, as, the, eagle, stone, where, some, victims, were, slain, plazas, were, where, the, bulk, of, worshippers, gathered, to, watch, rites, and, dances, performed, to, join, in, the, songs, and, sacrifices, the, audience, often, bled, themselves, during, the, rites, and, to, partake, in, any, festival, foods, nobility, sat, on, tiered, seating, under, awnings, around, the, plaza, periphery, and, some, conducted, part, of, the, ceremonies, on, the, temple, continual, rebuilding, enabled, tlatoani, and, other, dignitaries, to, celebrate, their, achievements, by, dedicating, new, sculptures, monuments, and, other, renovations, to, the, temples, for, festivals, temple, steps, and, tiers, were, also, festooned, with, flowers, banners, and, other, decorations, each, pyramid, had, a, flat, top, to, accommodate, dancers, and, priests, performing, rites, close, to, the, temple, steps, there, was, usually, a, sacrificial, slab, and, braziers, the, temple, house, calli, itself, was, relatively, small, although, the, more, important, ones, had, high, and, ornately, carved, internal, ceilings, to, maintain, the, sanctity, of, the, gods, these, temple, houses, were, kept, fairly, dark, and, mysterious, a, characteristic, that, was, further, enhanced, by, having, their, interiors, swirling, with, smoke, from, copal, meaning, incense, and, the, burning, of, offerings, cortes, and, diaz, describe, these, sanctuaries, as, containing, sacred, images, and, relics, of, the, gods, often, bejeweled, but, shrouded, under, ritual, clothes, and, other, veils, and, hidden, behind, curtains, hung, with, feathers, and, bells, flowers, and, offerings, including, a, great, amount, of, blood, generally, covered, much, of, the, floors, and, walls, near, these, images, each, image, stood, on, a, pedestal, and, occupied, its, own, sanctuary, larger, temples, also, featured, subsidiary, chambers, accommodating, lesser, deities, in, the, ceremonial, center, of, tenochtitlan, the, most, important, temple, was, the, great, temple, which, was, a, double, pyramid, with, two, temples, on, top, one, was, dedicated, to, huitzilopochtli, this, temple, was, called, coatepec, meaning, snake, mountain, and, the, other, temple, was, dedicated, to, tlaloc, below, the, tlatoani, were, the, high, priests, of, these, two, temples, both, high, priests, were, called, by, the, title, quetzalcoatl, the, high, priest, of, huitzilopochtli, was, quetzalcoatl, totec, tlamacazqui, and, the, high, priest, of, tlaloc, was, quetzalcoatl, tlaloc, tlamacazqui, other, important, temples, were, located, in, the, four, divisions, of, the, town, one, example, was, the, temple, called, yopico, in, moyotlan, which, was, dedicated, to, xipe, totec, furthermore, all, the, calpullis, had, special, temples, dedicated, to, the, patron, gods, of, the, calpulli, priests, were, educated, at, the, calmecac, if, they, were, from, noble, families, and, in, the, telpochcalli, if, they, were, commoners, the, aztec, world, consisted, of, three, main, parts, the, earth, world, on, which, humans, lived, including, tamoanchan, the, mythical, origin, of, human, beings, an, underworld, which, belonged, to, the, dead, called, mictlan, place, of, death, and, the, upper, plane, in, the, sky, the, earth, and, the, underworld, were, both, open, for, humans, to, enter, whereas, the, upper, plane, in, the, sky, was, impenetrable, to, humans, existence, was, envisioned, as, straddling, the, two, worlds, in, a, cycle, of, birth, life, death, and, rebirth, thus, as, the, sun, was, believed, to, dwell, in, the, underworld, at, night, to, rise, reborn, in, the, morning, and, maize, kernels, were, interred, to, later, sprout, anew, the, human, and, divine, existence, was, also, envisioned, as, being, cyclical, the, upper, and, nether, worlds, were, both, thought, to, be, layered, mictlan, had, nine, layers, which, were, inhabited, by, different, deities, and, mythical, beings, the, sky, had, thirteen, layers, the, highest, of, which, was, called, omeyocan, place, of, duality, and, served, as, the, residence, of, the, progenitor, dual, god, ometeotl, the, lowest, layer, is, said, to, have, housed, the, fire, god, and, was, level, with, the, earth, after, death, the, soul, of, the, aztec, went, to, one, of, three, places, the, sun, mictlan, or, tlalocan, souls, of, fallen, warriors, and, women, that, died, in, childbirth, would, transform, into, hummingbirds, that, followed, the, sun, on, its, journey, through, the, sky, souls, of, people, who, died, from, less, glorious, causes, would, go, to, mictlan, those, who, drowned, would, go, to, tlalocan, in, aztec, cosmology, as, in, mesoamerica, in, general, geographical, features, such, as, caves, and, mountains, held, symbolic, value, as, places, of, crossing, between, the, upper, and, nether, worlds, the, cardinal, directions, were, symbolically, connected, to, the, religious, layout, of, the, world, as, well, each, direction, was, associated, with, specific, colors, and, gods, to, the, aztecs, death, was, instrumental, in, the, perpetuation, of, creation, and, gods, and, humans, alike, had, the, responsibility, of, sacrificing, themselves, in, order, to, allow, life, to, continue, this, worldview, is, best, described, in, the, myth, of, the, five, suns, recorded, in, the, codex, chimalpopoca, which, recounts, how, quetzalcoatl, stole, the, bones, of, the, previous, generation, in, the, underworld, and, how, later, the, gods, created, four, successive, worlds, or, suns, for, their, subjects, to, live, in, all, of, which, were, destroyed, then, by, an, act, of, self, sacrifice, one, of, the, gods, nanahuatzin, the, pimpled, one, caused, a, fifth, and, final, sun, to, rise, where, the, first, humans, made, out, of, maize, dough, could, live, thanks, to, his, sacrifice, humans, were, responsible, for, the, sun, s, continued, revival, blood, sacrifice, in, various, forms, were, conducted, both, humans, and, animals, were, sacrificed, depending, on, the, god, to, be, placated, and, the, ceremony, being, conducted, and, priests, of, some, gods, were, sometimes, required, to, provide, their, own, blood, through, self, mutilation, sacrificial, rituals, among, the, aztecs, and, in, mesoamerica, in, general, must, be, seen, in, the, context, of, religious, cosmology, sacrifice, and, death, was, necessary, for, the, continued, existence, of, the, world, likewise, each, part, of, life, had, one, or, more, deities, associated, with, it, and, these, had, to, be, paid, their, dues, in, order, to, achieve, success, gods, were, paid, with, sacrificial, offerings, of, food, flowers, effigies, and, quail, but, the, larger, the, effort, required, of, the, god, the, greater, the, sacrifice, had, to, be, blood, fed, the, gods, and, kept, the, sun, from, falling, for, some, of, the, most, important, rites, a, priest, would, offer, his, own, blood, by, cutting, his, ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest, genitals, or, offer, a, human, life, or, a, god, s, life, the, people, who, were, sacrificed, came, from, many, segments, of, society, and, might, have, been, a, war, captive, slave, or, a, member, of, aztec, society, the, sacrifice, might, also, have, been, man, or, woman, adult, or, child, or, noble, or, commoner, an, important, aspect, of, aztec, ritual, life, was, the, teixiptla, which, can, be, understood, as, a, kind, of, substitute, or, embodiment, of, a, godly, being, priests, or, otherwise, specially, elected, individuals, would, be, dressed, up, to, achieve, the, likeness, of, a, specific, deity, to, honor, the, gods, various, outfits, and, festivals, were, held, the, aztec, deities, served, as, providers, for, all, of, the, society, s, needs, along, with, various, rituals, and, offerings, dressing, up, was, thought, as, a, way, to, respect, the, gods, worshiped, it, was, considered, an, honor, to, impersonate, a, god, the, person, selected, to, do, so, was, venerated, as, an, actual, physical, manifestation, of, the, god, this, would, sometimes, end, in, the, impersonator, s, death, such, as, in, the, many, ritual, sacrifices, tied, to, certain, deities, see, below, other, times, the, impersonator, would, survive, such, as, in, a, ceremony, where, a, priest, impersonated, the, water, goddess, chalchiuhtlicue, to, welcome, the, water, brought, to, tenochtitlan, by, an, aqueduct, as, with, the, impersonation, of, gods, aztec, ritual, was, often, a, reenactment, of, a, mythical, event, which, at, once, served, to, remind, the, aztecs, of, their, religion, bring, about, good, luck, in, daily, life, and, forward, a, political, goal, these, reenactments, often, took, a, form, similar, to, european, theater, but, the, aztec, understanding, of, such, performances, were, very, different, there, was, no, clear, divide, between, the, actor, and, the, figure, they, played, see, also, aztec, philosophy, there, has, been, discussion, on, whether, the, aztec, religion, was, a, polytheistic, or, pantheistic, religion, pantheism, is, the, belief, that, everything, is, divine, and, the, divine, is, everything, james, maffie, in, his, book, aztec, philosophy, understanding, a, world, in, motion, argued, that, the, religion, of, the, aztecs, was, pantheistic, in, nature, maffie, believes, that, the, aztec, view, of, teotl, found, in, their, poetry, is, sufficient, to, constitute, a, monist, pantheism, he, provides, nine, characteristics, of, teotl, as, supporting, this, view, focusing, on, his, interpretation, of, the, cosmos, being, a, unity, that, is, ontologically, identical, with, teotl, several, other, authors, discuss, pantheism, in, aztec, religion, and, philosophy, miguel, le, n, portilla, examines, pantheism, though, he, hesitates, to, label, it, as, entirely, pantheistic, instead, positing, that, a, specific, interpretation, of, their, theology, and, philosophy, is, more, representative, of, aztec, thought, louise, m, burkhart, also, claims, that, the, theology, of, the, aztecs, was, monist, in, nature, though, polytheistic, like, maffie, she, posits, that, monism, arises, from, teotl, which, she, sees, as, the, primary, agent, regarding, the, nature, of, the, universe, however, this, view, of, aztec, religion, was, relegated, to, the, priests, and, upper, classes, the, religion, of, the, common, people, was, polytheistic, worshiping, the, many, deities, as, separate, entities, see, also, aztec, philosophy, like, other, mesoamerican, religions, the, aztec, religion, contained, aspects, of, dualism, within, their, conception, of, the, world, an, example, of, this, is, the, deity, ometeotl, who, is, split, into, ometecuhtli, lord, of, duality, and, omecihuatl, dual, lady, they, dwell, in, the, place, of, duality, together, which, is, one, of, the, thirteen, heavens, however, despite, being, referred, to, as, separate, entities, they, are, complementary, parts, of, a, whole, miguel, le, n, portilla, describes, the, linguistic, evidence, for, this, found, in, a, passage, of, the, c, dice, matritense, de, la, real, academia, and, presented, in, his, book, aztec, thought, and, culture, in, a, section, on, the, various, heavens, the, line, there, dwells, the, true, god, and, his, consort, is, dissected, examining, the, word, i, n, mic, commonly, translated, as, consort, le, n, portilla, derives, it, from, the, prefix, of, i, the, possessive, prefix, and, the, verb, namique, to, find, to, help, the, prefix, is, not, only, a, possessive, but, can, be, translated, as, of, him, or, equal, to, him, therefore, his, consort, is, simply, another, aspect, of, him, which, constitutes, a, form, of, dialectical, monism, and, not, true, dualism, le, n, portilla, also, examines, the, phrase, flower, and, song, which, is, an, idiom, referring, to, the, poetry, and, creative, works, of, the, aztecs, it, is, a, difrasismo, two, words, put, together, that, form, a, singular, metaphorical, unit, these, grammatical, constructions, also, illustrate, the, dualism, of, both, the, aztec, language, and, religion, and, they, are, also, common, in, prayers, another, example, of, dualist, thought, in, aztec, religion, is, in, the, design, of, the, great, templo, mayor, in, tenochtitlan, atop, the, great, pyramid, sat, two, shrines, one, to, tlaloc, the, god, of, rain, and, agriculture, and, the, other, to, huitzipochtli, the, god, of, warfare, and, the, god, of, the, mexica, these, two, opposing, shrines, at, the, top, of, the, templo, mayor, also, represented, the, society, of, tenochtitlan, both, the, aspects, of, their, society, that, demanded, tribute, and, warfare, but, also, the, domestic, aspects, such, as, agriculture, the, aztec, religious, year, was, connected, mostly, to, the, natural, 365, day, calendar, the, xiuhpohualli, yearcount, which, followed, the, agricultural, year, each, of, the, 18, twenty, day, months, of, the, religious, year, had, its, particular, religious, festival, most, of, which, were, connected, to, agricultural, themes, the, greatest, festival, was, the, x, iuhmolpilli, or, new, fire, ceremony, held, every, 52, years, when, the, ritual, and, agricultural, calendars, coincided, and, a, new, cycle, started, in, the, table, below, the, veintena, festivals, are, shown, the, deities, with, which, they, were, associated, and, the, kinds, of, rituals, involved, the, descriptions, of, the, rites, are, based, on, the, descriptions, given, in, sahag, n, s, primeros, memoriales, the, florentine, codex, and, of, diego, dur, n, s, of, the, gods, and, rites, all, of, which, provide, detailed, accounts, of, the, rituals, written, in, nahuatl, soon, after, the, conquest, when, the, spaniards, documented, aztec, religious, and, ritual, life, they, provided, abundant, evidence, that, suggests, that, there, existed, a, correspondence, between, the, tropical, year, the, cycles, of, nature, and, aztec, ceremonies, given, that, such, a, relation, existed, and, that, ritual, functioned, to, reinforce, it, scholars, speculate, that, an, unknown, method, must, have, been, used, to, maintain, the, calendar, in, harmony, with, the, solar, year, the, main, deity, in, the, mexica, religion, was, the, sun, god, and, war, god, huitzilopochtli, he, directed, the, mexicas, to, found, a, city, on, the, site, where, they, would, see, an, eagle, devouring, an, animal, not, all, chronicles, agree, on, what, the, eagle, was, devouring, one, says, it, was, a, precious, bird, and, though, father, duran, says, it, was, a, snake, this, is, not, mentioned, in, any, pre, hispanic, source, while, perching, on, a, fruit, bearing, nopal, cactus, according, to, legend, huitzilopochtli, had, to, kill, his, nephew, c, pil, and, throw, his, heart, on, the, lake, but, since, c, pil, was, his, relative, huitzilopochtli, decided, to, honor, him, and, caused, a, cactus, to, grow, over, c, pil, s, heart, which, became, a, sacred, place, legend, has, it, that, this, is, the, site, on, which, the, mexicas, built, their, capital, city, of, tenochtitlan, tenochtitlan, was, built, on, an, island, in, the, middle, of, lake, texcoco, where, modern, day, mexico, city, is, located, this, legendary, vision, is, pictured, on, the, coat, of, arms, of, mexico, according, to, their, own, history, when, the, mexicas, arrived, in, the, anahuac, valley, around, lake, texcoco, they, were, considered, by, the, other, groups, as,

capital, punishment, and, boarding, schools, for, young, aztecs, the, spanish, tried, to, enforce, worship, of, the, christian, god, the, spanish, attempted, to, gut, the, aztec, religion, by, abolishing, human, sacrifice, and, worship, of, the, war, gods, they, also, destroyed, temples, and, suppressed, public, worship, while, this, was, largely, done, through, force, the, cult, of, the,

spanish, turned, to, converting, aztec, children, removing, them, from, their, parents, and, putting, them, under, the, strict, authority, of, monks, this, created, a, generational, conflict, some, aztec, children, actively, participated, in, the, destruction, of, aztec, temples, pushing, for, their, parents, to, convert, to, christianity, however, it, wasn, t, until, the, arrival, of, franciscan, monks, that, the, entire, population, began, to, convert, the, francescian, monks, adopted, aztec, song, and, dance, into, their, services, by, giving, them, christian, themes, their, attempt, to, incorporate, aztec, religion, led, to, religious, syncretism, where, the, two, religions, began, to, mix, aztecs, began, to, worship, saints, in, the, same, way, that, they, might, have, worshiped, patron, deities, they, began, to, do, pilgrimages, to, pilgrimage, centers, often, set, over, old, aztec, religious, sites, and, adopted, a, sort, of, polytheism, surrounding, the, christian, saints, this, mixing, of, religion, became, even, more, clear, when, juan, diego, saw, the, marian, apparition, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, while, this, is, often, seen, as, the, turning, point, where, the, aztecs, finally, adopted, christianity, the, worship, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, highly, paralleled, that, of, the, major, aztec, deities, guadalupe, was, seen, to, protect, children, and, punish, the, errant, just, as, old, aztec, gods, had, done, and, aztecs, created, shrines, and, sacrificed, objects, to, her, in, fact, even, now, the, worship, of, the, virgin, of, guadalupe, is, reminiscent, of, old, aztec, practices, while, catholicism, did, dominate, aztec, religious, values, are, seen, in, central, america, even, today, for, instance, the, popular, holiday, dia, de, los, muertos, still, highlights, aztec, ideas, of, the, afterlife, and, ancestors, media, related, to, aztec, religion, at, wikimedia, commons
