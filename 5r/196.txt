halakha, h, l, x, hah, law, kh, hebrew, romanized, h, l, sephardic, also, transliterated, as, halacha, halakhah, and, halocho, ashkenazic, is, the, collective, body, of, jewish, religious, laws, that, are, derived, from, the, written, and, oral, torah, halakha, is, based, on, biblical, commandments, mitzvot, subsequent, talmudic, and, rabbinic, laws, and, the, customs, and, traditions, which, were, compiled, in, the, many, books, such, as, the, shulchan, aruch, halakha, is, often, translated, as, jewish, law, although, a, more, literal, translation, might, be, the, way, to, behave, or, the, way, of, walking, the, word, is, derived, from, the, root, which, means, to, behave, also, to, go, or, to, walk, halakha, not, only, guides, religious, practices, and, beliefs, it, also, guides, numerous, aspects, of, day, to, day, life, historically, widespread, observance, of, the, laws, of, the, torah, is, first, in, evidence, beginning, in, the, second, century, bce, in, the, jewish, diaspora, halakha, served, many, jewish, communities, as, an, enforceable, avenue, of, law, both, civil, and, religious, since, no, differentiation, of, them, exists, in, classical, judaism, since, the, jewish, enlightenment, haskalah, and, jewish, emancipation, some, have, come, to, view, the, halakha, as, less, binding, in, day, to, day, life, because, it, relies, on, rabbinic, interpretation, as, opposed, to, the, authoritative, canonical, text, which, is, recorded, in, the, hebrew, bible, under, contemporary, israeli, law, certain, areas, of, israeli, family, and, personal, status, law, are, under, the, authority, of, the, rabbinic, courts, so, they, are, treated, according, to, halakha, some, minor, differences, in, halakha, are, found, among, ashkenazi, jews, mizrahi, jews, sephardi, jews, yemenite, ethiopian, and, other, jewish, communities, which, historically, lived, in, isolation, the, word, halakha, is, derived, from, the, hebrew, root, halakh, to, walk, or, to, go, 252, taken, literally, therefore, halakha, translates, as, the, way, to, walk, rather, than, law, the, word, halakha, refers, to, the, corpus, of, rabbinic, legal, texts, or, to, the, overall, system, of, religious, law, the, term, may, also, be, related, to, akkadian, ilku, a, property, tax, rendered, in, aramaic, as, halakh, designating, one, or, several, obligations, it, may, be, descended, from, hypothetical, reconstructed, proto, semitic, root, halak, meaning, to, go, which, also, has, descendants, in, akkadian, arabic, aramaic, and, ugaritic, halakha, is, often, contrasted, with, aggadah, the, telling, the, diverse, corpus, of, rabbinic, exegetical, narrative, philosophical, mystical, and, other, non, legal, texts, at, the, same, time, since, writers, of, halakha, may, draw, upon, the, aggadic, and, even, mystical, literature, a, dynamic, interchange, occurs, between, the, genres, halakha, also, does, not, include, the, parts, of, the, torah, not, related, to, commandments, halakha, constitutes, the, practical, application, of, the, 613, mitzvot, commandments, in, the, torah, as, developed, through, discussion, and, debate, in, the, classical, rabbinic, literature, especially, the, mishnah, and, the, talmud, the, oral, torah, and, as, codified, in, the, mishneh, torah, and, shulchan, aruch, because, halakha, is, developed, and, applied, by, various, halakhic, authorities, rather, than, one, sole, official, voice, different, individuals, and, communities, may, well, have, different, answers, to, halakhic, questions, with, few, exceptions, controversies, are, not, settled, through, authoritative, structures, because, during, the, jewish, diaspora, jews, lacked, a, single, judicial, hierarchy, or, appellate, review, process, for, halakha, according, to, some, scholars, the, words, halakha, and, sharia, both, mean, literally, the, path, to, follow, the, fiqh, literature, parallels, rabbinical, law, developed, in, the, talmud, with, fatwas, being, analogous, to, rabbinic, responsa, according, to, the, talmud, tractate, makot, 613, mitzvot, are, in, the, torah, 248, positive, thou, shalt, mitzvot, and, 365, negative, thou, shalt, not, mitzvot, supplemented, by, seven, mitzvot, legislated, by, the, rabbis, of, antiquity, currently, many, of, the, 613, commandments, cannot, be, performed, until, the, building, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, and, the, universal, resettlement, of, the, jewish, people, in, the, land, of, israel, by, the, messiah, according, to, one, count, only, 369, can, be, kept, meaning, that, 40, of, mitzvot, are, not, possible, to, perform, rabbinic, judaism, divides, laws, into, categories, this, division, between, revealed, and, rabbinic, commandments, may, influence, the, importance, of, a, rule, its, enforcement, and, the, nature, of, its, ongoing, interpretation, halakhic, authorities, may, disagree, on, which, laws, fall, into, which, categories, or, the, circumstances, if, any, under, which, prior, rabbinic, rulings, can, be, re, examined, by, contemporary, rabbis, but, all, halakhic, jews, hold, that, both, categories, exist, and, that, the, first, category, is, immutable, with, exceptions, only, for, life, saving, and, similar, emergency, circumstances, a, second, classical, distinction, is, between, the, written, law, laws, written, in, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, oral, law, laws, which, are, believed, to, have, been, transmitted, orally, prior, to, their, later, compilation, in, texts, such, as, the, mishnah, talmud, and, rabbinic, codes, commandments, are, divided, into, positive, and, negative, commands, which, are, treated, differently, in, terms, of, divine, and, human, punishment, positive, commandments, require, an, action, to, be, performed, and, are, considered, to, bring, the, performer, closer, to, god, negative, commandments, traditionally, 365, in, number, forbid, a, specific, action, and, violations, create, a, distance, from, god, a, further, division, is, made, between, chukim, decrees, laws, without, obvious, explanation, such, as, shatnez, the, law, prohibiting, wearing, clothing, made, of, mixtures, of, linen, and, wool, mishpatim, judgements, laws, with, obvious, social, implications, and, eduyot, testimonies, or, commemorations, such, as, the, shabbat, and, holidays, through, the, ages, various, rabbinical, authorities, have, classified, some, of, the, 613, commandments, in, many, ways, a, different, approach, divides, the, laws, into, a, different, set, of, categories, the, development, of, halakha, in, the, period, before, the, maccabees, which, has, been, described, as, the, formative, period, in, the, history, of, its, development, is, shrouded, in, obscurity, historian, yitzhak, baer, argued, that, there, was, little, pure, academic, legal, activity, at, this, period, and, that, many, of, the, laws, originating, at, this, time, were, produced, by, a, means, of, neighbourly, good, conduct, rules, in, a, similar, way, as, carried, out, by, greeks, in, the, age, of, solon, for, example, the, first, chapter, of, bava, kamma, contains, a, formulation, of, the, law, of, torts, worded, in, the, first, person, 256, the, boundaries, of, jewish, law, are, determined, through, the, halakhic, process, a, religious, ethical, system, of, legal, reasoning, rabbis, generally, base, their, opinions, on, the, primary, sources, of, halakha, as, well, as, on, precedent, set, by, previous, rabbinic, opinions, the, major, sources, and, genre, of, halakha, consulted, include, in, antiquity, the, sanhedrin, functioned, essentially, as, the, supreme, court, and, legislature, in, the, us, judicial, system, for, judaism, and, had, the, power, to, administer, binding, law, including, both, received, law, and, its, own, rabbinic, decrees, on, all, jews, rulings, of, the, sanhedrin, became, halakha, see, oral, law, that, court, ceased, to, function, in, its, full, mode, in, 40, ce, today, the, authoritative, application, of, jewish, law, is, left, to, the, local, rabbi, and, the, local, rabbinical, courts, with, only, local, applicability, in, branches, of, judaism, that, follow, halakha, lay, individuals, make, numerous, ad, hoc, decisions, but, are, regarded, as, not, having, authority, to, decide, certain, issues, definitively, since, the, days, of, the, sanhedrin, however, no, body, or, authority, has, been, generally, regarded, as, having, the, authority, to, create, universally, recognized, precedents, as, a, result, halakha, has, developed, in, a, somewhat, different, fashion, from, anglo, american, legal, systems, with, a, supreme, court, able, to, provide, universally, accepted, precedents, generally, halakhic, arguments, are, effectively, yet, unofficially, peer, reviewed, when, a, rabbinic, posek, he, who, makes, a, statement, decisor, proposes, an, additional, interpretation, of, a, law, that, interpretation, may, be, considered, binding, for, the, posek, s, questioner, or, immediate, community, depending, on, the, stature, of, the, posek, and, the, quality, of, the, decision, an, interpretation, may, also, be, gradually, accepted, by, other, rabbis, and, members, of, other, jewish, communities, under, this, system, there, is, a, tension, between, the, relevance, of, earlier, and, later, authorities, in, constraining, halakhic, interpretation, and, innovation, on, the, one, hand, there, is, a, principle, in, halakha, not, to, overrule, a, specific, law, from, an, earlier, era, after, it, is, accepted, by, the, community, as, a, law, or, vow, unless, supported, by, another, relevant, earlier, precedent, see, list, below, on, the, other, hand, another, principle, recognizes, the, responsibility, and, authority, of, later, authorities, and, especially, the, posek, handling, a, then, current, question, in, addition, the, halakha, embodies, a, wide, range, of, principles, that, permit, judicial, discretion, and, deviation, ben, menahem, notwithstanding, the, potential, for, innovation, rabbis, and, jewish, communities, differ, greatly, on, how, they, make, changes, in, halakha, notably, poskim, frequently, extend, the, application, of, a, law, to, new, situations, but, do, not, consider, such, applications, as, constituting, a, change, in, halakha, for, example, many, orthodox, rulings, concerning, electricity, are, derived, from, rulings, concerning, fire, as, closing, an, electrical, circuit, may, cause, a, spark, in, contrast, conservative, poskim, consider, that, switching, on, electrical, equipment, is, physically, and, chemically, more, like, turning, on, a, water, tap, which, is, permissible, by, halakha, than, lighting, a, fire, which, is, not, permissible, and, therefore, permitted, on, shabbat, the, reformative, judaism, in, some, cases, explicitly, interprets, halakha, to, take, into, account, its, view, of, contemporary, society, for, instance, most, conservative, rabbis, extend, the, application, of, certain, jewish, obligations, and, permissible, activities, to, women, see, below, within, certain, jewish, communities, formal, organized, bodies, do, exist, within, modern, orthodox, judaism, there, is, no, one, committee, or, leader, but, modern, us, based, orthodox, rabbis, generally, agree, with, the, views, set, by, consensus, by, the, leaders, of, the, rabbinical, council, of, america, within, conservative, judaism, the, rabbinical, assembly, has, an, official, committee, on, jewish, law, and, standards, note, that, takkanot, plural, of, takkanah, in, general, do, not, affect, or, restrict, observance, of, torah, mitzvot, sometimes, takkanah, refers, to, either, gezeirot, or, takkanot, however, the, talmud, states, that, in, exceptional, cases, the, sages, had, the, authority, to, uproot, matters, from, the, torah, in, talmudic, and, classical, halakhic, literature, this, authority, refers, to, the, authority, to, prohibit, some, things, that, would, otherwise, be, biblically, sanctioned, shev, v, al, ta, aseh, thou, shall, stay, seated, and, not, do, rabbis, may, rule, that, a, specific, mitzvah, from, the, torah, should, not, be, performed, e, g, blowing, the, shofar, on, shabbat, or, taking, the, lulav, and, etrog, on, shabbat, these, examples, of, takkanot, which, may, be, executed, out, of, caution, lest, some, might, otherwise, carry, the, mentioned, items, between, home, and, the, synagogue, thus, inadvertently, violating, a, sabbath, melakha, another, rare, and, limited, form, of, takkanah, involved, overriding, torah, prohibitions, in, some, cases, the, sages, allowed, the, temporary, violation, of, a, prohibition, in, order, to, maintain, the, jewish, system, as, a, whole, this, was, part, of, the, basis, for, esther, s, relationship, with, ahasuerus, xeres, for, general, usage, of, takkanaot, in, jewish, history, see, the, article, takkanah, for, examples, of, this, being, used, in, conservative, judaism, see, conservative, halakha, the, antiquity, of, the, rules, can, be, determined, only, by, the, dates, of, the, authorities, who, quote, them, in, general, they, cannot, safely, be, declared, older, than, the, tanna, repeater, to, whom, they, are, first, ascribed, it, is, certain, however, that, the, seven, middot, measurements, and, referring, to, behavior, of, hillel, and, the, thirteen, of, ishmael, are, earlier, than, the, time, of, hillel, himself, who, was, the, first, to, transmit, them, the, talmud, gives, no, information, concerning, the, origin, of, the, middot, although, the, geonim, sages, regarded, them, as, sinaitic, law, given, to, moses, at, sinai, the, middot, seem, to, have, been, first, laid, down, as, abstract, rules, by, the, teachers, of, hillel, though, they, were, not, immediately, recognized, by, all, as, valid, and, binding, different, schools, interpreted, and, modified, them, restricted, or, expanded, them, in, various, ways, rabbi, akiva, and, rabbi, ishmael, and, their, scholars, especially, contributed, to, the, development, or, establishment, of, these, rules, it, must, be, borne, in, mind, however, that, neither, hillel, ishmael, nor, eliezer, ben, jose, sought, to, give, a, complete, enumeration, of, the, rules, of, interpretation, current, in, his, day, but, that, they, omitted, from, their, collections, many, rules, which, were, then, followed, akiva, devoted, his, attention, particularly, to, the, grammatical, and, exegetical, rules, while, ishmael, developed, the, logical, the, rules, laid, down, by, one, school, were, frequently, rejected, by, another, because, the, principles, that, guided, them, in, their, respective, formulations, were, essentially, different, according, to, akiva, the, divine, language, of, the, torah, is, distinguished, from, the, speech, of, men, by, the, fact, that, in, the, former, no, word, or, sound, is, superfluous, some, scholars, have, observed, a, similarity, between, these, rabbinic, rules, of, interpretation, and, the, hermeneutics, of, ancient, hellenistic, culture, for, example, saul, lieberman, argues, that, the, names, of, rabbi, ishmael, s, middot, e, g, kal, vahomer, a, combination, of, the, archaic, form, of, the, word, for, straw, and, the, word, for, clay, straw, and, clay, referring, to, the, obvious, are, hebrew, translations, of, greek, terms, although, the, methods, of, those, middot, are, not, greek, in, origin, orthodox, judaism, holds, that, halakha, is, the, divine, law, as, laid, out, in, the, torah, five, books, of, moses, rabbinical, laws, rabbinical, decrees, and, customs, combined, the, rabbis, who, made, many, additions, and, interpretations, of, jewish, law, did, so, only, in, accordance, with, regulations, they, believe, were, given, for, this, purpose, to, moses, on, mount, sinai, see, deuteronomy, 17, 11, see, orthodox, judaism, beliefs, about, jewish, law, and, tradition, conservative, judaism, holds, that, halakha, is, normative, and, binding, and, is, developed, as, a, partnership, between, people, and, god, based, on, sinaitic, torah, while, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, conservative, views, a, common, belief, is, that, halakha, is, and, has, always, been, an, evolving, process, subject, to, interpretation, by, rabbis, in, every, time, period, see, conservative, judaism, beliefs, reconstructionist, judaism, holds, that, halakha, is, normative, and, binding, while, also, believing, that, it, is, an, evolving, concept, and, that, the, traditional, halakhic, system, is, incapable, of, producing, a, code, of, conduct, that, is, meaningful, for, and, acceptable, to, the, vast, majority, of, contemporary, jews, reconstructionist, founder, mordecai, kaplan, believed, that, jewish, life, meaningless, without, jewish, law, and, one, of, the, planks, of, the, society, for, the, jewish, renascence, of, which, kaplan, was, one, of, the, founders, stated, we, accept, the, halakha, which, is, rooted, in, the, talmud, as, the, norm, of, jewish, life, availing, ourselves, at, the, same, time, of, the, method, implicit, therein, to, interpret, and, develop, the, body, of, jewish, law, in, accordance, with, the, actual, conditions, and, spiritual, needs, of, modern, life, reform, judaism, holds, that, modern, views, of, how, the, torah, and, rabbinic, law, developed, imply, that, the, body, of, rabbinic, jewish, law, is, no, longer, normative, seen, as, binding, on, jews, today, those, in, the, traditionalist, wing, believe, that, the, halakha, represents, a, personal, starting, point, holding, that, each, jew, is, obligated, to, interpret, the, torah, talmud, and, other, jewish, works, for, themselves, and, this, interpretation, will, create, separate, commandments, for, each, person, those, in, the, liberal, and, classical, wings, of, reform, believe, that, in, this, day, and, era, most, jewish, religious, rituals, are, no, longer, necessary, and, many, hold, that, following, most, jewish, laws, is, actually, counter, productive, they, propose, that, judaism, has, entered, a, phase, of, ethical, monotheism, and, that, the, laws, of, judaism, are, only, remnants, of, an, earlier, stage, of, religious, evolution, and, need, not, be, followed, this, is, considered, wrong, and, even, heretical, by, orthodox, and, conservative, judaism, humanistic, jews, value, the, torah, as, a, historical, political, and, sociological, text, written, by, their, ancestors, they, do, not, believe, that, every, word, of, the, torah, is, true, or, even, morally, correct, just, because, the, torah, is, old, the, torah, is, both, disagreed, with, and, questioned, humanistic, jews, believe, that, the, entire, jewish, experience, and, not, only, the, torah, should, be, studied, as, a, source, for, jewish, behavior, and, ethical, values, some, jews, believe, that, gentiles, are, bound, by, a, subset, of, halakha, called, the, seven, laws, of, noah, also, referred, to, as, the, noahide, laws, they, are, a, set, of, imperatives, which, according, to, the, talmud, were, given, by, god, to, the, children, of, noah, that, is, all, of, humanity, despite, its, internal, rigidity, halakha, has, a, degree, of, flexibility, in, finding, solutions, to, modern, problems, that, are, not, explicitly, mentioned, in, the, torah, from, the, very, beginnings, of, rabbinic, judaism, halakhic, inquiry, allowed, for, a, sense, of, continuity, between, past, and, present, a, self, evident, trust, that, their, pattern, of, life, and, belief, now, conformed, to, the, sacred, patterns, and, beliefs, presented, by, scripture, and, tradition, according, to, an, analysis, by, jewish, scholar, jeffrey, rubenstein, of, michael, berger, s, book, rabbinic, authority, the, authority, that, rabbis, hold, derives, not, from, the, institutional, or, personal, authority, of, the, sages, but, from, a, communal, decision, to, recognize, that, authority, much, as, a, community, recognizes, a, certain, judicial, system, to, resolve, its, disputes, and, interpret, its, laws, given, this, covenantal, relationship, rabbis, are, charged, with, connecting, their, contemporary, community, with, the, traditions, and, precedents, of, the, past, when, presented, with, contemporary, issues, rabbis, go, through, a, halakhic, process, to, find, an, answer, the, classical, approach, has, permitted, new, rulings, regarding, modern, technology, for, example, some, of, these, rulings, guide, jewish, observers, about, the, proper, use, of, electricity, on, the, sabbath, and, holidays, often, as, to, the, applicability, of, the, law, in, any, given, situation, the, proviso, is, to, consult, your, local, rabbi, or, posek, this, notion, lends, rabbis, a, certain, degree, of, local, authority, however, for, more, complex, questions, the, issue, is, passed, on, to, higher, rabbis, who, will, then, issue, a, teshuva, which, is, a, responsa, that, is, binding, indeed, rabbis, will, continuously, issue, different, opinions, and, will, constantly, review, each, other, s, work, so, as, to, maintain, the, truest, sense, of, halakha, overall, this, process, allows, rabbis, to, maintain, connection, of, traditional, jewish, law, to, modern, life, of, course, the, degree, of, flexibility, depends, on, the, sect, of, judaism, with, reform, being, the, most, flexible, conservative, somewhat, in, the, middle, and, orthodox, being, much, more, stringent, and, rigid, modern, critics, however, have, charged, that, with, the, rise, of, movements, that, challenge, the, divine, authority, of, halakha, traditional, jews, have, greater, reluctance, to, change, not, only, the, laws, themselves, but, also, other, customs, and, habits, than, traditional, rabbinical, judaism, did, prior, to, the, advent, of, reform, in, the, 19th, century, orthodox, jews, believe, that, halakha, is, a, religious, system, whose, core, represents, the, revealed, will, of, god, although, orthodox, judaism, acknowledges, that, rabbis, have, made, many, decisions, and, decrees, regarding, jewish, law, where, the, written, torah, itself, is, nonspecific, they, did, so, only, in, accordance, with, regulations, received, by, moses, on, mount, sinai, see, deuteronomy, 5, 8, 13, these, regulations, were, transmitted, orally, until, shortly, after, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, they, were, then, recorded, in, the, mishnah, and, explained, in, the, talmud, and, commentaries, throughout, history, up, until, the, present, day, orthodox, judaism, believes, that, subsequent, interpretations, have, been, derived, with, the, utmost, accuracy, and, care, the, most, widely, accepted, codes, of, jewish, law, are, known, as, mishneh, torah, and, the, shulchan, aruch, orthodox, judaism, has, a, range, of, opinions, on, the, circumstances, and, extent, to, which, change, is, permissible, haredi, jews, generally, hold, that, even, minhagim, customs, must, be, retained, and, existing, precedents, cannot, be, reconsidered, modern, orthodox, authorities, are, more, inclined, to, permit, limited, changes, in, customs, and, some, reconsideration, of, precedent, despite, the, orthodox, views, that, halakha, was, given, at, sinai, orthodox, thought, and, especially, modern, orthodox, thought, encourages, debate, allows, for, disagreement, and, encourages, rabbis, to, enact, decisions, based, on, contemporary, needs, rabbi, moshe, feinstein, says, in, his, introduction, to, his, collection, of, responsa, that, a, rabbi, who, studies, the, texts, carefully, is, required, to, provide, a, halakhic, decision, that, decision, is, considered, to, be, a, true, teaching, even, if, it, is, not, the, true, teaching, in, according, to, the, heavens, for, instance, rabbi, joseph, b, soloveitchik, believes, that, the, job, of, a, halakhic, decisor, is, to, apply, halakha, which, exists, in, an, ideal, realm, to, people, s, lived, experiences, moshe, shmuel, glasner, the, chief, rabbi, of, cluj, klausenberg, in, german, or, in, yiddish, stated, that, the, oral, torah, was, an, oral, tradition, by, design, to, allow, for, the, creative, application, of, halakha, to, each, time, period, and, even, enabling, halakha, to, evolve, he, writes, thus, whoever, has, due, regard, for, the, truth, will, conclude, that, the, reason, the, interpretation, of, the, torah, was, transmitted, orally, and, forbidden, to, be, written, down, was, not, to, make, unchanging, and, not, to, tie, the, hands, of, the, sages, of, every, generation, from, interpreting, scripture, according, to, their, understanding, only, in, this, way, can, the, eternity, of, torah, be, understood, for, the, changes, in, the, generations, and, their, opinions, situation, and, material, and, moral, condition, requires, changes, in, their, laws, decrees, and, improvements, the, view, held, by, conservative, judaism, is, that, the, torah, is, not, the, word, of, god, in, a, literal, sense, however, the, torah, is, still, held, as, mankind, s, record, of, its, understanding, of, god, s, revelation, and, thus, still, has, divine, authority, therefore, halakha, is, still, seen, as, binding, conservative, jews, use, modern, methods, of, historical, study, to, learn, how, jewish, law, has, changed, over, time, and, are, in, some, cases, willing, to, change, jewish, law, in, the, present, a, key, practical, difference, between, conservative, and, orthodox, approaches, is, that, conservative, judaism, holds, that, its, rabbinical, body, s, powers, are, not, limited, to, reconsidering, later, precedents, based, on, earlier, sources, but, the, committee, on, jewish, law, and, standards, cjls, is, empowered, to, override, biblical, and, taanitic, prohibitions, by, takkanah, decree, when, perceived, to, be, inconsistent, with, modern, requirements, or, views, of, ethics, the, cjls, has, used, this, power, on, a, number, of, occasions, most, famously, in, the, driving, teshuva, which, says, that, if, someone, is, unable, to, walk, to, any, synagogue, on, the, sabbath, and, their, commitment, to,
