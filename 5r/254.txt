notions, of, religion, since, the, 1990s, those, influences, and, its, outcomes, have, been, the, topic, of, debate, among, scholars, of, hinduism, and, have, also, been, taken, over, by, critics, of, the, western, view, on, india, hinduism, as, it, is, commonly, known, can, be, subdivided, into, a, number, of, major, currents, of, the, historical, division, into, six, darsanas, philosophies, two, schools, vedanta, and, yoga, are, currently, the, most, prominent, the, six, stika, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, which, recognise, the, authority, of, the, vedas, are, s, nkhya, yoga, ny, ya, vaisheshika, mim, ms, and, ved, nta, classified, by, primary, deity, or, deities, four, major, hinduism, modern, currents, are, vaishnavism, vishnu, shaivism, shiva, shaktism, devi, and, smartism, five, deities, treated, as, equals, hinduism, also, accepts, numerous, divine, beings, with, many, hindus, considering, the, deities, to, be, aspects, or, manifestations, of, a, single, impersonal, absolute, or, ultimate, reality, or, supreme, god, while, some, hindus, maintain, that, a, specific, deity, represents, the, supreme, and, various, deities, are, lower, manifestations, of, this, supreme, other, notable, characteristics, include, a, belief, in, the, existence, of, tman, self, reincarnation, of, one, s, tman, and, karma, as, well, as, a, belief, in, dharma, duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues, and, right, way, of, living, although, variation, exists, with, some, not, following, these, beliefs, june, mcdaniel, 2007, classifies, hinduism, into, six, major, kinds, and, numerous, minor, kinds, in, order, to, understand, the, expression, of, emotions, among, the, hindus, the, major, kinds, according, to, mcdaniel, are, folk, hinduism, based, on, local, traditions, and, cults, of, local, deities, and, is, the, oldest, non, literate, system, vedic, hinduism, based, on, the, earliest, layers, of, the, vedas, traceable, to, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, vedantic, hinduism, based, on, the, philosophy, of, the, upanishads, including, advaita, vedanta, emphasising, knowledge, and, wisdom, yogic, hinduism, following, the, text, of, yoga, sutras, of, patanjali, emphasising, introspective, awareness, dharmic, hinduism, or, daily, morality, which, mcdaniel, states, is, stereotyped, in, some, books, as, the, only, form, of, hindu, religion, with, a, belief, in, karma, cows, and, caste, and, bhakti, or, devotional, hinduism, where, intense, emotions, are, elaborately, incorporated, in, the, pursuit, of, the, spiritual, michaels, distinguishes, three, hindu, religions, and, four, forms, of, hindu, religiosity, the, three, hindu, religions, are, brahmanic, sanskritic, hinduism, folk, religions, and, tribal, religions, and, founded, religions, the, four, forms, of, hindu, religiosity, are, the, classical, karma, marga, jnana, marga, bhakti, marga, and, heroism, which, is, rooted, in, militaristic, traditions, these, militaristic, traditions, include, ramaism, the, worship, of, a, hero, of, epic, literature, rama, believing, him, to, be, an, incarnation, of, vishnu, and, parts, of, political, hinduism, heroism, is, also, called, virya, marga, according, to, michaels, one, out, of, nine, hindu, belongs, by, birth, to, one, or, both, of, the, brahmanic, sanskritic, hinduism, and, folk, religion, typology, whether, practising, or, non, practicing, he, classifies, most, hindus, as, belonging, by, choice, to, one, of, the, founded, religions, such, as, vaishnavism, and, shaivism, that, are, moksha, focussed, and, often, de, emphasise, brahman, brahmin, priestly, authority, yet, incorporate, ritual, grammar, of, brahmanic, sanskritic, hinduism, he, includes, among, founded, religions, buddhism, jainism, sikhism, that, are, now, distinct, religions, syncretic, movements, such, as, brahmo, samaj, and, the, theosophical, society, as, well, as, various, guru, isms, and, new, religious, movements, such, as, maharishi, mahesh, yogi, baps, and, iskcon, inden, states, that, the, attempt, to, classify, hinduism, by, typology, started, in, the, imperial, times, when, proselytising, missionaries, and, colonial, officials, sought, to, understand, and, portray, hinduism, from, their, interests, hinduism, was, construed, as, emanating, not, from, a, reason, of, spirit, but, fantasy, and, creative, imagination, not, conceptual, but, symbolical, not, ethical, but, emotive, not, rational, or, spiritual, but, of, cognitive, mysticism, this, stereotype, followed, and, fit, states, inden, with, the, imperial, imperatives, of, the, era, providing, the, moral, justification, for, the, colonial, project, from, tribal, animism, to, buddhism, everything, was, subsumed, as, part, of, hinduism, the, early, reports, set, the, tradition, and, scholarly, premises, for, the, typology, of, hinduism, as, well, as, the, major, assumptions, and, flawed, presuppositions, that, have, been, at, the, foundation, of, indology, hinduism, according, to, inden, has, been, neither, what, imperial, religionists, stereotyped, it, to, be, nor, is, it, appropriate, to, equate, hinduism, to, be, merely, the, monist, pantheism, and, philosophical, idealism, of, advaita, vedanta, some, academics, suggest, that, hinduism, can, be, seen, as, a, category, with, fuzzy, edges, rather, than, as, a, well, defined, and, rigid, entity, some, forms, of, religious, expression, are, central, to, hinduism, and, others, while, not, as, central, still, remain, within, the, category, based, on, this, idea, gabriella, eichinger, ferro, luzzi, has, developed, a, prototype, theory, approach, to, the, definition, of, hinduism, to, its, adherents, hinduism, is, a, traditional, way, of, life, many, practitioners, refer, to, the, orthodox, form, of, hinduism, as, san, tana, dharma, the, eternal, law, or, the, eternal, way, hindus, regard, hinduism, to, be, thousands, of, years, old, the, puranic, chronology, as, narrated, in, the, mahabharata, ramayana, and, the, puranas, envisions, a, timeline, of, events, related, to, hinduism, starting, well, before, 3000, bce, the, word, dharma, is, used, here, to, mean, religion, similar, to, modern, indo, aryan, languages, rather, than, with, its, original, sanskrit, meaning, all, aspects, of, a, hindu, life, namely, acquiring, wealth, artha, fulfilment, of, desires, kama, and, attaining, liberation, moksha, are, viewed, here, as, part, of, dharma, which, encapsulates, the, right, way, of, living, and, eternal, harmonious, principles, in, their, fulfilment, the, use, of, the, term, san, tana, dharma, for, hinduism, is, a, modern, usage, based, on, the, belief, that, the, origins, of, hinduism, lie, beyond, human, history, as, revealed, in, the, hindu, texts, san, tana, dharma, refers, to, timeless, eternal, set, of, truths, and, this, is, how, hindus, view, the, origins, of, their, religion, it, is, viewed, as, those, eternal, truths, and, traditions, with, origins, beyond, human, history, truths, divinely, revealed, shruti, in, the, vedas, the, most, ancient, of, the, world, s, scriptures, to, many, hindus, hinduism, is, a, tradition, that, can, be, traced, at, least, to, the, ancient, vedic, era, the, western, term, religion, to, the, extent, it, means, dogma, and, an, institution, traceable, to, a, single, founder, is, inappropriate, for, their, tradition, states, hatcher, san, tana, dharma, historically, referred, to, the, eternal, duties, religiously, ordained, in, hinduism, duties, such, as, honesty, refraining, from, injuring, living, beings, ahi, s, purity, goodwill, mercy, patience, forbearance, self, restraint, generosity, and, asceticism, these, duties, applied, regardless, of, a, hindu, s, class, caste, or, sect, and, they, contrasted, with, svadharma, one, s, own, duty, in, accordance, with, one, s, class, or, caste, var, a, and, stage, in, life, puru, rtha, in, recent, years, the, term, has, been, used, by, hindu, leaders, reformers, and, nationalists, to, refer, to, hinduism, sanatana, dharma, has, become, a, synonym, for, the, eternal, truth, and, teachings, of, hinduism, that, transcend, history, and, are, unchanging, indivisible, and, ultimately, nonsectarian, some, have, referred, to, hinduism, as, the, vaidika, dharma, the, word, vaidika, in, sanskrit, means, derived, from, or, conformable, to, the, veda, or, relating, to, the, veda, traditional, scholars, employed, the, terms, vaidika, and, avaidika, those, who, accept, the, vedas, as, a, source, of, authoritative, knowledge, and, those, who, do, not, to, differentiate, various, indian, schools, from, jainism, buddhism, and, charvaka, according, to, klaus, klostermaier, the, term, vaidika, dharma, is, the, earliest, self, designation, of, hinduism, according, to, arvind, sharma, the, historical, evidence, suggests, that, the, hindus, were, referring, to, their, religion, by, the, term, vaidika, dharma, or, a, variant, thereof, by, the, 4th, century, ce, according, to, brian, k, smith, t, is, debatable, at, the, very, least, as, to, whether, the, term, vaidika, dharma, cannot, with, the, proper, concessions, to, historical, cultural, and, ideological, specificity, be, comparable, to, and, translated, as, hinduism, or, hindu, religion, whatever, the, case, many, hindu, religious, sources, see, persons, or, groups, which, they, consider, as, non, vedic, and, which, reject, vedic, var, rama, caste, and, life, stage, orthodoxy, as, being, heretics, p, a, a, p, kha, a, for, example, the, bh, gavata, pur, a, considers, buddhists, jains, as, well, as, some, shaiva, groups, like, the, pa, upatas, and, k, p, lins, to, be, p, a, as, heretics, according, to, alexis, sanderson, the, early, sanskrit, texts, differentiate, between, vaidika, vaishnava, shaiva, shakta, saura, buddhist, and, jaina, traditions, however, the, late, 1st, millennium, ce, indic, consensus, had, indeed, come, to, conceptualize, a, complex, entity, corresponding, to, hinduism, as, opposed, to, buddhism, and, jainism, excluding, only, certain, forms, of, antinomian, shakta, shaiva, from, its, fold, some, in, the, mimamsa, school, of, hindu, philosophy, considered, the, agamas, such, as, the, pancaratrika, to, be, invalid, because, it, did, not, conform, to, the, vedas, some, kashmiri, scholars, rejected, the, esoteric, tantric, traditions, to, be, a, part, of, vaidika, dharma, the, atimarga, shaivism, ascetic, tradition, datable, to, about, 500, ce, challenged, the, vaidika, frame, and, insisted, that, their, agamas, and, practices, were, not, only, valid, they, were, superior, than, those, of, the, vaidikas, however, adds, sanderson, this, shaiva, ascetic, tradition, viewed, themselves, as, being, genuinely, true, to, the, vedic, tradition, and, held, unanimously, that, the, ruti, and, sm, ti, of, brahmanism, are, universally, and, uniquely, valid, in, their, own, sphere, and, that, as, such, they, are, man, s, sole, means, of, valid, knowledge, the, term, vaidika, dharma, means, a, code, of, practice, that, is, based, on, the, vedas, but, it, is, unclear, what, based, on, the, vedas, really, implies, states, julius, lipner, the, vaidika, dharma, or, vedic, way, of, life, states, lipner, does, not, mean, hinduism, is, necessarily, religious, or, that, hindus, have, a, universally, accepted, conventional, or, institutional, meaning, for, that, term, to, many, it, is, as, much, a, cultural, term, many, hindus, do, not, have, a, copy, of, the, vedas, nor, have, they, ever, seen, or, personally, read, parts, of, a, veda, like, a, christian, might, relate, to, the, bible, or, a, muslim, might, to, the, quran, yet, states, lipner, this, does, not, mean, that, their, whole, life, s, orientation, cannot, be, traced, to, the, vedas, or, that, it, does, not, in, some, way, derive, from, it, though, many, religious, hindus, implicitly, acknowledge, the, authority, of, the, vedas, this, acknowledgment, is, often, no, more, than, a, declaration, that, someone, considers, himself, a, hindu, and, most, indians, today, pay, lip, service, to, the, veda, and, have, no, regard, for, the, contents, of, the, text, some, hindus, challenge, the, authority, of, the, vedas, thereby, implicitly, acknowledging, its, importance, to, the, history, of, hinduism, states, lipner, bal, gangadhar, tilak, gave, the, following, definition, in, gita, rahasya, 1915, acceptance, of, the, vedas, with, reverence, recognition, of, the, fact, that, the, means, or, ways, to, salvation, are, diverse, and, realization, of, the, truth, that, the, number, of, gods, to, be, worshipped, is, large, it, was, quoted, by, the, indian, supreme, court, in, 1966, and, again, in, 1995, as, an, adequate, and, satisfactory, definition, and, is, still, the, legal, definition, of, a, hindu, today, hindu, beliefs, are, vast, and, diverse, and, thus, hinduism, is, often, referred, to, as, a, family, of, religions, rather, than, a, single, religion, within, each, religion, in, this, family, of, religions, there, are, different, theologies, practices, and, sacred, texts, hinduism, does, not, have, a, unified, system, of, belief, encoded, in, a, declaration, of, faith, or, a, creed, but, is, rather, an, umbrella, term, comprising, the, plurality, of, religious, phenomena, of, india, according, to, the, supreme, court, of, india, unlike, other, religions, in, the, world, the, hindu, religion, does, not, claim, any, one, prophet, it, does, not, worship, any, one, god, it, does, not, believe, in, any, one, philosophic, concept, it, does, not, follow, any, one, act, of, religious, rites, or, performances, in, fact, it, does, not, satisfy, the, traditional, features, of, a, religion, or, creed, it, is, a, way, of, life, and, nothing, more, part, of, the, problem, with, a, single, definition, of, the, term, hinduism, is, the, fact, that, hinduism, does, not, have, a, founder, it, is, a, synthesis, of, various, traditions, the, brahmanical, orthopraxy, the, renouncer, traditions, and, popular, or, local, traditions, theism, is, also, difficult, to, use, as, a, unifying, doctrine, for, hinduism, because, while, some, hindu, philosophies, postulate, a, theistic, ontology, of, creation, other, hindus, are, or, have, been, atheists, despite, the, differences, there, is, also, a, sense, of, unity, most, hindu, traditions, revere, a, body, of, religious, or, sacred, literature, the, vedas, although, there, are, exceptions, these, texts, are, a, reminder, of, the, ancient, cultural, heritage, and, point, of, pride, for, hindus, though, louis, renou, stated, that, even, in, the, most, orthodox, domains, the, reverence, to, the, vedas, has, come, to, be, a, simple, raising, of, the, hat, halbfass, states, that, although, shaivism, and, vaishnavism, may, be, regarded, as, self, contained, religious, constellations, there, is, a, degree, of, interaction, and, reference, between, the, theoreticians, and, literary, representatives, of, each, tradition, that, indicates, the, presence, of, a, wider, sense, of, identity, a, sense, of, coherence, in, a, shared, context, and, of, inclusion, in, a, common, framework, and, horizon, brahmins, played, an, essential, role, in, the, development, of, the, post, vedic, hindu, synthesis, disseminating, vedic, culture, to, local, communities, and, integrating, local, religiosity, into, the, trans, regional, brahmanic, culture, in, the, post, gupta, period, vedanta, developed, in, southern, india, where, orthodox, brahmanic, culture, and, the, hindu, culture, were, preserved, building, on, ancient, vedic, traditions, while, accommoda, the, multiple, demands, of, hinduism, the, notion, of, common, denominators, for, several, religions, and, traditions, of, india, further, developed, from, the, 12th, century, ce, lorenzen, traces, the, emergence, of, a, family, resemblance, and, what, he, calls, as, beginnings, of, medieval, and, modern, hinduism, taking, shape, at, c, 300, 600, ce, with, the, development, of, the, early, puranas, and, continuities, with, the, earlier, vedic, religion, lorenzen, states, that, the, establishment, of, a, hindu, self, identity, took, place, through, a, process, of, mutual, self, definition, with, a, contrasting, muslim, other, according, to, lorenzen, this, presence, of, the, other, is, necessary, to, recognise, the, loose, family, resemblance, among, the, various, traditions, and, schools, according, to, the, indologist, alexis, sanderson, before, islam, arrived, in, india, the, sanskrit, sources, differentiated, vaidika, vai, ava, aiva, kta, saura, buddhist, and, jaina, traditions, but, they, had, no, name, that, denotes, the, first, five, of, these, as, a, collective, entity, over, and, against, buddhism, and, jainism, this, absence, of, a, formal, name, states, sanderson, does, not, mean, that, the, corresponding, concept, of, hinduism, did, not, exist, by, late, 1st, millennium, ce, the, concept, of, a, belief, and, tradition, distinct, from, buddhism, and, jainism, had, emerged, this, complex, tradition, accepted, in, its, identity, almost, all, of, what, is, currently, hinduism, except, certain, antinomian, tantric, movements, some, conservative, thinkers, of, those, times, questioned, whether, certain, shaiva,

philosophical, teachings, of, the, upanishads, epics, puranas, and, the, schools, known, retrospectively, as, the, six, systems, saddarsana, of, mainstream, hindu, philosophy, the, tendency, of, a, blurring, of, philosophical, distinctions, has, also, been, noted, by, mikel, burley, hacker, called, this, inclusivism, and, michaels, speaks, of, the, identificatory, habit, lorenzen, locates, the, origins, of, a, distinct, hindu, identity, in, the, interaction, between, muslims, and, hindus, and, a, process, of, mutual, self, definition, with, a, contrasting, muslim, other, which, started, well, before, 1800, michaels, notes, as, a, counteraction, to, islamic, supremacy, and, as, part, of, the, continuing, process, of, regionalization, two, religious, innovations, developed, in, the, hindu, religions, the, formation, of, sects, and, a, historicization, which, preceded, later, nationalism, aints, and, sometimes, militant, sect, leaders, such, as, the, marathi, poet, tukaram, 1609, 1649, and, ramdas, 1608, 1681, articulated, ideas, in, which, they, glorified, hinduism, and, the, past, the, brahmins, also, produced, increasingly, historical, texts, especially, eulogies, and,

the, same, person, who, relied, on, texts, preserved, by, brahmins, priests, for, their, information, of, indian, religions, and, animist, observations, that, the, missionary, orientalists, presumed, was, hinduism, these, reports, influenced, perceptions, about, hinduism, scholars, such, as, pennington, state, that, the, colonial, polemical, reports, led, to, fabricated, stereotypes, where, hinduism, was, mere, mystic, paganism, devoted, to, the, service, of, devils, while, other, scholars, state, that, the, colonial, constructions, influenced, the, belief, that, the, vedas, bhagavad, gita, manusmriti, and, such, texts, were, the, essence, of, hindu, religiosity, and, in, the, modern, association, of, hindu, doctrine, with, the, schools, of, vedanta, in, particular, advaita, vedanta, as, a, paradigmatic, example, of, hinduism, s, mystical, nature, pennington, while, concurring, that, the, study, of, hinduism, as, a, world, religion, began, in, the, colonial, era, disagrees, that, hinduism, is, a, colonial, european, era, invention, he, states, that, the, shared, theology, common, ritual, grammar, and, way, of, life, of, those, who, identify, themselves, as, hindus, is, traceable, to, ancient, times, all, of, religion, is, contained, in, the, vedanta, that, is, in, the, three, stages, of, the, vedanta, philosophy, the, dvaita, vishisht, dvaita, and, advaita, one, comes, after, the, other, these, are, the, three, stages, of, spiritual, growth, in, man, each, one, is, necessary, this, is, the, essential, of, religion, the, vedanta, applied, to, the, various, ethnic, customs, and, creeds, of, india, is, hinduism, swami, vivekananda, this, inclusivism, was, further, developed, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, by, hindu, reform, movements, and, neo, vedanta, and, has, become, characteristic, of, modern, hinduism, beginning, in, the, 19th, century, indian, modernists, re, asserted, hinduism, as, a, major, asset, of, indian, civilisation, meanwhile, purifying, hinduism, from, its, tantric, elements, and, elevating, the, vedic, elements, western, stereotypes, were, reversed, emphasising, the, universal, aspects, and, introducing, modern, approaches, of, social, problems, this, approach, had, great, appeal, not, only, in, india, but, also, in, the, west, major, representatives, of, hindu, modernism, are, ram, mohan, roy, swami, vivekananda, sarvepalli, radhakrishnan, and, mahatma, gandhi, raja, rammohan, roy, is, known, as, the, father, of, the, hindu, renaissance, he, was, a, major, influence, on, swami, vivekananda, who, according, to, flood, was, a, figure, of, great, importance, in, the, development, of, a, modern, hindu, self, understanding, and, in, formulating, the, west, s, view, of, hinduism, central, to, his, philosophy, is, the, idea, that, the, divine, exists, in, all, beings, that, all, human, beings, can, achieve, union, with, this, innate, divinity, and, that, seeing, this, divine, as, the, essence, of, others, will, further, love, and, social, harmony, according, to, vivekananda, there, is, an, essential, unity, to, hinduism, which, underlies, the, diversity, of, its, many, forms, according, to, flood, vivekananda, s, vision, of, hinduism, is, one, generally, accepted, by, most, english, speaking, middle, class, hindus, today, sarvepalli, radhakrishnan, sought, to, reconcile, western, rationalism, with, hinduism, presenting, hinduism, as, an, essentially, rationalistic, and, humanistic, religious, experience, this, global, hinduism, has, a, worldwide, appeal, transcending, national, boundaries, and, according, to, flood, becoming, a, world, religion, alongside, christianity, islam, and, buddhism, both, for, the, hindu, diaspora, communities, and, for, westerners, who, are, attracted, to, non, western, cultures, and, religions, it, emphasises, universal, spiritual, values, such, as, social, justice, peace, and, the, spiritual, transformation, of, humanity, it, has, developed, partly, due, to, re, enculturation, or, the, pizza, effect, in, which, elements, of, hindu, culture, have, been, exported, to, the, west, gaining, popularity, there, and, as, a, consequence, also, gained, greater, popularity, in, india, this, globalisation, of, hindu, culture, brought, to, the, west, teachings, which, have, become, an, important, cultural, force, in, western, societies, and, which, in, turn, have, become, an, important, cultural, force, in, india, their, place, of, origin, the, hindutva, movement, has, extensively, argued, for, the, unity, of, hinduism, dismissing, the, differences, and, regarding, india, as, a, hindu, country, since, ancient, times, and, there, are, assumptions, of, political, dominance, of, hindu, nationalism, in, india, also, known, as, neo, hindutva, there, have, also, been, increase, in, pre, dominance, of, hindutva, in, nepal, similar, to, that, of, india, the, scope, of, hinduism, is, also, increasing, in, the, other, parts, of, the, world, due, to, the, cultural, influences, such, as, yoga, and, hare, krishna, movement, by, many, missionaries, organisations, especially, by, iskcon, and, this, is, also, due, to, the, migration, of, indian, hindus, to, the, other, nations, of, the, world, hinduism, is, growing, fast, in, many, western, nations, and, in, some, african, nations, hinduism, has, no, central,

the, upanisads, show, a, different, soteriology, based, on, reincarnation, they, show, little, concern, with, ancestor, rites, and, they, begin, to, philosophically, interpret, the, earlier, rituals,

with, a, wide, variety, of, beliefs, its, concept, of, god, is, complex, and, depends, upon, each, individual, and, the, tradition, and, philosophy, followed, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, henotheistic, i, e, involving, devotion, to, a, single, god, while, accepting, the, existence, of, others, but, any, such, term, is, an, overgeneralisation, who, really, knows, who, will, here, proclaim, it, whence, was, it, produced, whence, is, this, creation, the, gods, came, afterwards, with, the, creation, of, this, universe, who, then, knows, whence, it, has, arisen, the, nasadiya, sukta, creation, hymn, of, the, rig, veda, is, one, of, the, earliest, texts, which, demonstrates, a, sense, of, metaphysical, speculation, about, what, created, the, universe, the, concept, of, god,

the, hymns, repeatedly, refer, to, one, truth, and, one, ultimate, reality, the, one, truth, of, vedic, literature, in, modern, era, scholarship, has, been, interpreted, as, monotheism, monism, as, well, as, a, deified, hidden, principles, behind, the, great, happenings, and, processes, of, nature, hindus, believe, that, all, living, creatures, have, a, self, this, true, self, of, every, person, is, called, the, tman, the, self, is, believed, to, be, eternal, according, to, the, monistic, pantheistic, non, dualist, theologies, of, hinduism, such, as, advaita, vedanta, school, this, atman, is, indistinct, from, brahman, the, supreme, spirit, or, the, ultimate, reality, the, goal, of, life, according, to, the, advaita, school, is, to, realise, that, one, s, self, is, identical, to, supreme,

ishvara, bhagavan, parameshwara, deva, or, devi, and, these, terms, have, different, meanings, in, different, schools, of, hinduism, hindu, texts, accept, a, polytheistic, framework, but, this, is, generally, conceptualised, as, the, divine, essence, or, luminosity, that, gives, vitality, and, animation, to, the, inanimate, natural, substances, there, is, a, divine, in, everything, human, beings, animals, trees, and, rivers, it, is, observable, in, offerings, to, rivers, trees, tools, of, one, s, work, animals, and, birds, rising, sun, friends, and, guests, teachers, and, parents, it, is, the, divine, in, these, that, makes, each, sacred, and, worthy, of, reverence, rather, than, them, being, sacred, in, and, of, themselves, this, perception, of, divinity, manifested, in, all, things, as, buttimer, and, wallin, view, it, makes, the, vedic, foundations, of, hinduism, quite, distinct, from, animism, in, which, all, things, are, themselves, divine, the, animistic, premise, sees, multiplicity, and, therefore, an, equality, of, ability, to, compete, for, power, when, it, comes, to, man, and, man, man, and, animal, man, and, nature, etc, the, vedic, view, does, not, perceive, this, competition, equality, of, man, to, nature, or, multiplicity, so, much, as, an, overwhelming, and, interconnecting, single, divinity, that, unifies, everyone, and, everything, the, hindu, scriptures, name, celestial, entities, called, devas, or, devi, in, feminine, form, which, may, be, translated, into, english, as, gods, or, heavenly, beings, the, devas, are, an, integral, part, of, hindu, culture, and, are, depicted, in, art, architecture, and, through, icons, and, stories, about, them, are, related, in, the, scriptures, particularly, in, indian, epic, poetry, and, the, puranas, they, are, however, often, distinguished, from, ishvara, a, personal, god, with, many, hindus, worshipping, ishvara, in, one, of, its, particular, manifestations, as, their, i, a, devat, or, chosen, ideal, the, choice, is, a, matter, of, individual, preference, and, of, regional, and, family, traditions, the, multitude, of, devas, is, considered, manifestations, of, brahman, the, word, avatar, does, not, appear, in, the, vedic, literature, it, appears, in, verb, forms, in, post, vedic, literature, and, as, a, noun, particularly, in, the, puranic, literature, after, the, 6th, century, ce, theologically, the, reincarnation, idea, is, most, often, associated, with, the, avatars, of, hindu, god, vishnu, though, the, idea, has, been, applied, to, other, deities, varying, lists, of, avatars, of, vishnu, appear, in, hindu, scriptures, including, the, ten, dashavatara, of, the, garuda, purana, and, the, twenty, two, avatars, in, the, bhagavata, purana, though, the, latter, adds, that, the, incarnations, of, vishnu, are, innumerable, the, avatars, of, vishnu, are, important, in, vaishnavism, theology, in, the, goddess, based, shaktism, tradition, avatars, of, the, devi, are, found, and, all, goddesses, are, considered, to, be, different, aspects, of, the, same, metaphysical, brahman, and, shakti, energy, while, avatars, of, other, deities, such, as, ganesha, and, shiva, are, also, mentioned, in, medieval, hindu, texts, this, is, minor, and, occasional, both, theistic, and, atheistic, ideas, for, epistemological, and, metaphysical, reasons, are, profuse, in, different, schools, of, hinduism, the, early, nyaya, school, of, hinduism, for, example, was, non, theist, atheist, but, later, nyaya, school, scholars, argued, that, god, exists, and, offered, proofs, using, its, theory, of, logic, other, schools, disagreed, with, nyaya, scholars, samkhya, mimamsa, and, carvaka, schools, of, hinduism, were, non, theist, atheist, arguing, that, god, was, an, unnecessary, metaphysical, assumption, its, vaisheshika, school, started, as, another, non, theistic, tradition, relying, on, naturalism, and, that, all, matter, is, eternal, but, it, later, introduced, the, concept, of, a, non, creator, god, the, yoga, school, of, hinduism, accepted, the, concept, of, a, personal, god, and, left, it, to, the, hindu, to, define, his, or, her, god,
