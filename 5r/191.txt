salvation, from, latin, salvatio, from, salva, safe, saved, is, the, state, of, being, saved, or, protected, from, harm, or, a, dire, situation, in, religion, and, theology, salvation, generally, refers, to, the, deliverance, of, the, soul, from, sin, and, its, consequences, the, academic, study, of, salvation, is, called, soteriology, in, abrahamic, religions, and, theology, salvation, is, the, saving, of, the, soul, from, sin, and, its, consequences, it, may, also, be, called, deliverance, or, redemption, from, sin, and, its, effects, depending, on, the, religion, or, even, denomination, salvation, is, considered, to, be, caused, either, only, by, the, grace, of, god, i, e, unmerited, and, unearned, or, by, faith, good, deeds, works, or, a, combination, thereof, religions, often, emphasize, that, man, is, a, sinner, by, nature, and, that, the, penalty, of, sin, is, death, physical, death, spiritual, death, spiritual, separation, from, god, and, eternal, punishment, in, hell, in, contemporary, judaism, redemption, hebrew, ge, ulah, refers, to, god, redeeming, the, people, of, israel, from, their, various, exiles, this, includes, the, final, redemption, from, the, present, exile, judaism, holds, that, adherents, do, not, need, personal, salvation, as, christians, believe, jews, do, not, subscribe, to, the, doctrine, of, original, sin, instead, they, place, a, high, value, on, individual, morality, as, defined, in, the, law, of, god, embodied, in, what, jews, know, as, the, torah, or, the, law, given, to, moses, by, god, on, biblical, mount, sinai, in, judaism, salvation, is, closely, related, to, the, idea, of, redemption, a, saving, from, the, states, or, circumstances, that, destroy, the, value, of, human, existence, god, as, the, universal, spirit, and, creator, of, the, world, is, the, source, of, all, salvation, for, humanity, provided, that, an, individual, honours, god, by, observing, his, precepts, so, redemption, or, salvation, depends, on, the, individual, judaism, stresses, that, salvation, cannot, be, obtained, through, anyone, else, or, by, just, invoking, a, deity, or, believing, in, any, outside, power, or, influence, the, jewish, concept, of, messiah, visualises, the, return, of, the, prophet, elijah, as, the, harbinger, of, one, who, will, redeem, the, world, from, war, and, suffering, leading, mankind, to, universal, brotherhood, under, the, fatherhood, of, one, god, the, messiah, is, not, considered, as, a, future, divine, or, supernatural, being, but, as, a, dominating, human, influence, in, an, age, of, universal, peace, characterised, by, the, spiritual, regeneration, of, humanity, in, judaism, salvation, is, open, to, all, people, and, not, limited, to, those, of, the, jewish, faith, the, only, important, consideration, being, that, the, people, must, observe, and, practise, the, ethical, pattern, of, behaviour, as, summarised, in, the, ten, commandments, when, jews, refer, to, themselves, as, the, chosen, people, of, god, they, do, not, imply, they, have, been, chosen, for, special, favours, and, privileges, but, rather, they, have, taken, it, upon, themselves, to, show, to, all, peoples, by, precept, and, example, the, ethical, way, of, life, when, examining, jewish, intellectual, sources, throughout, history, there, is, clearly, a, spectrum, of, opinions, regarding, death, versus, the, afterlife, possibly, an, over, simplification, one, source, says, salvation, can, be, achieved, in, the, following, manner, live, a, holy, and, righteous, life, dedicated, to, yahweh, the, god, of, creation, fast, worship, and, celebrate, during, the, appropriate, holidays, by, origin, and, nature, judaism, is, an, ethnic, religion, therefore, salvation, has, been, primarily, conceived, in, terms, of, the, destiny, of, israel, as, the, elect, people, of, yahweh, often, referred, to, as, the, lord, the, god, of, israel, in, the, biblical, text, of, psalms, there, is, a, description, of, death, when, people, go, into, the, earth, or, the, realm, of, the, dead, and, cannot, praise, god, the, first, reference, to, resurrection, is, collective, in, ezekiel, s, vision, of, the, dry, bones, when, all, the, israelites, in, exile, will, be, resurrected, there, is, a, reference, to, individual, resurrection, in, the, book, of, daniel, it, was, not, until, the, 2nd, century, bce, that, there, arose, a, belief, in, an, afterlife, in, which, the, dead, would, be, resurrected, and, undergo, divine, judgment, before, that, time, the, individual, had, to, be, content, that, his, posterity, continued, within, the, holy, nation, the, salvation, of, the, individual, jew, was, connected, to, the, salvation, of, the, entire, people, this, belief, stemmed, directly, from, the, teachings, of, the, torah, in, the, torah, god, taught, his, people, sanctification, of, the, individual, however, he, also, expected, them, to, function, together, spiritually, and, be, accountable, to, one, another, the, concept, of, salvation, was, tied, to, that, of, restoration, for, israel, during, the, second, temple, period, the, sadducees, high, priests, denied, any, particular, existence, of, individuals, after, death, because, it, wasn, t, written, in, the, torah, while, the, pharisees, ancestors, of, the, rabbis, affirmed, both, bodily, resurrection, and, immortality, of, the, soul, most, likely, based, on, the, influence, of, hellenistic, ideas, about, body, and, soul, and, the, pharisaic, belief, in, the, oral, torah, the, pharisees, maintained, that, after, death, the, soul, is, connected, to, god, until, the, messianic, era, when, it, is, rejoined, with, the, body, in, the, land, of, israel, at, the, time, of, resurrection, christianity, s, primary, premise, is, that, the, incarnation, and, death, of, jesus, christ, formed, the, climax, of, a, divine, plan, for, humanity, s, salvation, this, plan, was, conceived, by, god, before, the, creation, of, the, world, achieved, at, the, cross, and, it, would, be, completed, at, the, last, judgment, when, the, second, coming, of, christ, would, mark, the, catastrophic, end, of, the, world, and, the, creation, of, a, new, world, for, christianity, salvation, is, only, possible, through, jesus, christ, christians, believe, that, jesus, death, on, the, cross, was, the, once, for, all, sacrifice, that, atoned, for, the, sin, of, humanity, the, christian, religion, though, not, the, exclusive, possessor, of, the, idea, of, redemption, has, given, to, it, a, special, definiteness, and, a, dominant, position, taken, in, its, widest, sense, as, deliverance, from, dangers, and, ills, in, general, most, religions, teach, some, form, of, it, it, assumes, an, important, position, however, only, when, the, ills, in, question, form, part, of, a, great, system, against, which, human, power, is, helpless, according, to, christian, belief, sin, as, the, human, predicament, is, considered, to, be, universal, for, example, in, romans, 1, 18, 3, 20, the, apostle, paul, declared, everyone, to, be, under, sin, jew, and, gentile, alike, salvation, is, made, possible, by, the, life, death, and, resurrection, of, jesus, which, in, the, context, of, salvation, is, referred, to, as, the, atonement, christian, soteriology, ranges, from, exclusive, salvation, p, 123, to, universal, reconciliation, concepts, while, some, of, the, differences, are, as, widespread, as, christianity, itself, the, overwhelming, majority, agree, that, salvation, is, made, possible, by, the, work, of, jesus, christ, the, son, of, god, dying, on, the, cross, at, the, heart, of, christian, faith, is, the, reality, and, hope, of, salvation, in, jesus, christ, christian, faith, is, faith, in, the, god, of, salvation, revealed, in, jesus, of, nazareth, the, christian, tradition, has, always, equated, this, salvation, with, the, transcendent, eschatological, fulfillment, of, human, existence, in, a, life, freed, from, sin, finitude, and, mortality, and, united, with, the, triune, god, this, is, perhaps, the, non, negotiable, item, of, christian, faith, what, has, been, a, matter, of, debate, is, the, relation, between, salvation, and, our, activities, in, the, world, the, bible, presents, salvation, in, the, form, of, a, story, that, describes, the, outworking, of, god, s, eternal, plan, to, deal, with, the, problem, of, human, sin, the, story, is, set, against, the, background, of, the, history, of, god, s, people, and, reaches, its, climax, in, the, person, and, work, of, christ, the, old, testament, part, of, the, story, shows, that, people, are, sinners, by, nature, and, describes, a, series, of, covenants, by, which, god, sets, people, free, and, makes, promises, to, them, his, plan, includes, the, promise, of, blessing, for, all, nations, through, abraham, and, the, redemption, of, israel, from, every, form, of, bondage, god, showed, his, saving, power, throughout, israel, s, history, but, he, also, spoke, about, a, messianic, figure, who, would, save, all, people, from, the, power, guilt, and, penalty, of, sin, this, role, was, fulfilled, by, jesus, who, will, ultimately, destroy, all, the, devil, s, work, including, suffering, pain, and, death, variant, views, on, salvation, are, among, the, main, fault, lines, dividing, the, various, christian, denominations, both, between, roman, catholicism, and, protestantism, and, within, protestantism, notably, in, the, calvinist, arminian, debate, and, the, fault, lines, include, conflicting, definitions, of, depravity, predestination, atonement, but, most, pointedly, justification, salvation, according, to, most, denominations, is, believed, to, be, a, process, that, begins, when, a, person, first, becomes, a, christian, continues, through, that, person, s, life, and, is, completed, when, they, stand, before, christ, in, judgment, therefore, according, to, catholic, apologist, james, akin, the, faithful, christian, can, say, in, faith, and, hope, i, have, been, saved, i, am, being, saved, and, i, will, be, saved, christian, salvation, concepts, are, varied, and, complicated, by, certain, theological, concepts, traditional, beliefs, and, dogmas, scripture, is, subject, to, individual, and, ecclesiastical, interpretations, while, some, of, the, differences, are, as, widespread, as, christianity, itself, the, overwhelming, majority, agrees, that, salvation, is, made, possible, by, the, work, of, jesus, christ, the, son, of, god, dying, on, the, cross, the, purpose, of, salvation, is, debated, but, in, general, most, christian, theologians, agree, that, god, devised, and, implemented, his, plan, of, salvation, because, he, loves, them, and, regards, human, beings, as, his, children, since, human, existence, on, earth, is, said, to, be, given, to, sin, salvation, also, has, connotations, that, deal, with, the, liberation, of, human, beings, from, sin, and, the, sufferings, associated, with, the, punishment, of, sin, i, e, the, wages, of, sin, are, death, christians, believe, that, salvation, depends, on, the, grace, of, god, stagg, writes, that, a, fact, assumed, throughout, the, bible, is, that, humanity, is, in, serious, trouble, from, which, we, need, deliverance, the, fact, of, sin, as, the, human, predicament, is, implied, in, the, mission, of, jesus, and, it, is, explicitly, affirmed, in, that, connection, by, its, nature, salvation, must, answer, to, the, plight, of, humankind, as, it, actually, is, each, individual, s, plight, as, a, sinner, is, the, result, of, a, fatal, choice, involving, the, whole, person, in, bondage, guilt, estrangement, and, death, therefore, salvation, must, be, concerned, with, the, total, person, it, must, offer, redemption, from, bondage, forgiveness, for, guilt, reconciliation, for, estrangement, renewal, for, the, marred, image, of, god, according, to, doctrine, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, plan, of, salvation, is, god, s, plan, to, save, redeem, and, exalt, all, humankind, who, chose, either, in, this, life, or, in, the, world, of, spirits, of, the, dead, to, accept, the, grace, of, jesus, christ, by, exercising, faith, in, him, repenting, of, their, sins, and, by, making, and, keeping, sacred, covenants, including, baptism, since, the, vast, majority, of, god, s, children, depart, this, life, without, that, opportunity, christ, s, gospel, is, preached, to, the, unbelieving, spirits, in, spirit, prison, 1, peter, 3, 19, so, that, they, might, be, judged, by, the, same, standards, as, the, living, and, live, by, following, god, in, their, spirit, form, 1, peter, 4, 6, if, they, accept, christ, sincerely, repent, of, their, sins, and, accept, ordinances, done, on, their, behalf, they, can, by, the, grace, of, christ, receive, salvation, on, the, same, terms, as, the, living, for, this, reason, members, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, do, vicarious, work, for, the, dead, in, sacred, temples, the, elements, of, this, plan, are, drawn, from, various, sources, including, the, bible, book, of, mormon, doctrine, covenants, pearl, of, great, price, and, numerous, statements, made, by, the, leadership, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, in, islam, salvation, refers, to, the, eventual, entrance, to, paradise, islam, teaches, that, people, who, die, disbelieving, in, islam, do, not, receive, salvation, those, who, die, believing, in, the, one, god, and, his, message, islam, receive, salvation, narrated, anas, that, the, prophet, said, whoever, said, none, has, the, right, to, be, worshipped, but, allah, and, has, in, his, heart, good, faith, equal, to, the, weight, of, a, barley, grain, will, be, taken, out, of, hell, and, whoever, said, none, has, the, right, to, be, worshipped, but, allah, and, has, in, his, heart, good, faith, equal, to, the, weight, of, a, wheat, grain, will, be, taken, out, of, hell, and, whoever, said, none, has, the, right, to, be, worshipped, but, allah, and, has, in, his, heart, good, faith, equal, to, the, weight, of, an, atom, will, be, taken, out, of, hell, islam, teaches, that, all, who, enter, into, islam, must, remain, so, in, order, to, receive, salvation, whoever, seeks, a, way, other, than, islam, it, will, never, be, accepted, from, them, and, in, the, hereafter, they, will, be, among, the, losers, for, those, who, have, not, been, granted, islam, or, to, whom, the, message, has, not, been, brought, indeed, the, believers, jews, christians, and, sabians, whoever, truly, believes, in, allah, and, the, last, day, and, does, good, will, have, their, reward, with, their, lord, and, there, will, be, no, fear, for, them, nor, will, they, grieve, belief, in, the, one, god, also, known, as, the, tawhid, in, arabic, consists, of, two, parts, or, principles, islam, also, stresses, that, in, order, to, gain, salvation, one, must, also, avoid, sinning, along, with, performing, good, deeds, islam, acknowledges, the, inclination, of, humanity, towards, sin, therefore, muslims, are, constantly, commanded, to, seek, god, s, forgiveness, and, repent, islam, teaches, that, no, one, can, gain, salvation, simply, by, virtue, of, their, belief, or, deeds, instead, it, is, the, mercy, of, god, which, merits, them, salvation, as, we, have, to, know, that, by, the, mercy, of, god, we, are, doing, the, good, deeds, and, we, are, believing, in, god, however, repentance, must, not, be, used, to, sin, any, further, islam, teaches, that, god, is, merciful, allah, only, accepts, the, repentance, of, those, who, commit, evil, ignorantly, or, recklessly, then, repent, soon, after, allah, will, pardon, them, and, allah, is, all, knowing, all, wise, indeed, allah, does, not, forgive, associating, others, with, him, in, worship, but, forgives, anything, else, of, whoever, he, wills, and, whoever, associates, others, with, allah, has, indeed, committed, a, grave, sin, islam, describes, a, true, believer, to, have, love, of, god, and, fear, of, god, islam, also, teaches, that, every, person, is, responsible, for, their, own, sins, the, quran, states, if, you, disbelieve, then, know, that, allah, is, truly, not, in, need, of, you, nor, does, he, approve, of, disbelief, from, his, servants, but, if, you, become, grateful, through, faith, he, will, appreciate, that, from, you, no, soul, burdened, with, sin, will, bear, the, burden, of, another, then, to, your, lord, is, your, return, and, he, will, inform, you, of, what, you, used, to, do, he, certainly, knows, best, what, is, hidden, in, the, heart, al, agharr, al, muzani, who, was, from, amongst, the, companions, of, allah, s, apostle, reported, that, ibn, umar, stated, to, him, that, allah, s, messenger, said, o, people, seek, repentance, from, allah, verily, i, seek, repentance, from, him, a, hundred, times, a, day, sin, in, islam, is, not, a, state, but, an, action, a, bad, deed, islam, teaches, that, a, child, is, born, sinless, regardless, of, the, belief, of, his, parents, dies, a, muslim, he, enters, heaven, and, does, not, enter, hell, narrated, aisha, the, prophet, said, do, good, deeds, properly, sincerely, and, moderately, and, receive, good, news, because, one, s, good, deeds, will, not, make, him, enter, paradise, they, asked, even, you, o, allah, s, messenger, he, said, even, i, unless, and, until, allah, bestows, his, pardon, and, mercy, on, me, islam, is, built, on, five, principles, acts, of, worship, that, islam, teaches, to, be, mandatory, not, performing, the, mandatory, acts, of, worship, may, deprive, muslims, of, the, chance, of, salvation, according, to, ibn, umar, muhammad, said, that, islam, is, based, on, the, following, five, principles, hinduism, buddhism, jainism, and, sikhism, share, certain, key, concepts, which, are, interpreted, differently, by, different, groups, and, individuals, in, these, religions, one, is, not, liberated, from, sin, and, its, consequences, but, from, the, sa, s, ra, cycle, of, rebirth, perpetuated, by, passions, and, delusions, and, its, resulting, karma, they, differ, however, on, the, exact, nature, of, this, liberation, salvation, is, always, self, attained, in, dharmic, traditions, and, a, more, appropriate, term, would, be, moksha, liberation, or, mukti, release, this, state, and, the, conditions, considered, necessary, for, its, realization, is, described, in, early, texts, of, indian, religion, such, as, the, upanishads, and, the, p, li, canon, and, later, texts, such, the, yoga, sutras, of, patanjali, and, the, vedanta, tradition, moksha, can, be, attained, by, s, dhan, literally, means, of, accomplishing, something, it, includes, a, variety, of, disciplines, such, as, yoga, and, dhyana, meditation, nirvana, is, the, profound, peace, of, mind, that, is, acquired, with, moksha, in, buddhism, and, jainism, it, is, the, state, of, being, free, from, suffering, in, hindu, philosophy, it, is, union, with, the, brahman, supreme, being, the, word, literally, means, blown, out, as, in, a, candle, and, refers, in, the, buddhist, context, to, the, blowing, out, of, the, fires, of, desire, aversion, and, delusion, and, the, imperturbable, stillness, of, mind, acquired, thereafter, in, theravada, buddhism, the, emphasis, is, on, one, s, own, liberation, from, samsara, the, mahayana, traditions, emphasize, the, bodhisattva, path, in, which, each, buddha, and, bodhisattva, is, a, redeemer, assisting, the, buddhist, in, seeking, to, achieve, the, redemptive, state, the, assistance, rendered, is, a, form, of, self, sacrifice, on, the, part, of, the, teachers, who, would, presumably, be, able, to, achieve, total, detachment, from, worldly, concerns, but, have, instead, chosen, to, remain, engaged, in, the, material, world, to, the, degree, that, this, is, necessary, to, assist, others, in, achieving, such, detachment, in, jainism, salvation, moksha, and, nirvana, are, one, and, the, same, when, a, soul, atman, achieves, moksha, it, is, released, from, the, cycle, of, births, and, deaths, and, achieves, its, pure, self, it, then, becomes, a, siddha, one, who, has, accomplished, his, ultimate, objective, attaining, moksha, requires, annihilation, of, all, karmas, good, and, bad, because, if, karma, is, left, it, must, bear, fruit, while, early, taoism, had, no, understanding, of, the, concept, of, salvation, later, in, taoist, history, salvation, became, a, major, part, of, beliefs, about, it, things, one, could, do, to, be, saved, was, to, pray, offer, sacrifices, and, or, become,
