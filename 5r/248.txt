hadith, arabic, romanized, ad, th, or, athar, arabic, a, ar, lit, remnant, or, effect, is, a, form, of, islamic, oral, tradition, containing, the, purported, words, actions, and, the, silent, approvals, of, the, prophet, muhammad, each, hadith, is, associated, with, a, chain, of, narrators, a, lineage, of, people, who, reportedly, heard, and, repeated, the, hadith, from, which, the, source, of, the, hadith, can, apparently, be, traced, compilations, of, hadith, were, collected, by, islamic, scholars, in, the, centuries, after, muhammad, s, death, hadith, are, widely, respected, in, mainstream, muslim, thought, and, are, central, to, islamic, law, ad, th, is, the, arabic, word, for, things, like, a, report, or, an, account, of, an, event, 471, for, many, the, authority, of, hadith, is, a, source, for, religious, and, moral, guidance, known, as, sunnah, which, ranks, second, only, to, that, of, the, quran, which, muslims, hold, to, be, the, word, of, god, revealed, to, muhammad, while, the, number, of, verses, pertaining, to, law, in, the, quran, is, relatively, small, hadith, are, considered, by, many, to, give, direction, on, everything, from, details, of, religious, obligations, such, as, ghusl, or, wudu, ablutions, for, salat, prayer, to, the, correct, forms, of, salutations, and, the, importance, of, benevolence, to, slaves, thus, for, many, the, great, bulk, of, the, rules, of, sharia, are, derived, from, hadith, rather, than, the, quran, among, scholars, of, sunni, islam, the, term, hadith, may, include, not, only, the, words, advice, practices, etc, of, muhammad, but, also, those, of, his, companions, in, shia, islam, hadith, are, the, embodiment, of, the, sunnah, the, words, and, actions, of, muhammad, and, his, family, the, ahl, al, bayt, the, twelve, imams, and, muhammad, s, daughter, fatimah, unlike, the, quran, not, all, muslims, believe, that, hadith, accounts, or, at, least, not, all, hadith, accounts, are, divine, revelation, different, collections, of, had, th, would, come, to, differentiate, the, different, branches, of, the, islamic, faith, some, muslims, believe, that, islamic, guidance, should, be, based, on, the, quran, only, thus, rejecting, the, authority, of, hadith, some, further, claim, that, most, hadiths, are, fabrications, pseudepigrapha, created, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, ad, and, which, are, falsely, attributed, to, muhammad, historically, some, sects, of, the, kharijites, also, rejected, the, hadiths, while, mu, tazilites, rejected, the, hadiths, as, the, basis, for, islamic, law, while, at, the, same, time, accepting, the, sunnah, and, ijma, because, some, hadith, contain, questionable, and, even, contradictory, statements, the, authentication, of, hadith, became, a, major, field, of, study, in, islam, in, its, classic, form, a, hadith, consists, of, two, parts, the, chain, of, narrators, who, have, transmitted, the, report, the, isnad, and, the, main, text, of, the, report, the, matn, individual, hadith, are, classified, by, muslim, clerics, and, jurists, into, categories, such, as, sahih, authentic, hasan, good, or, da, if, weak, however, different, groups, and, different, scholars, may, classify, a, hadith, differently, historically, some, hadiths, deemed, to, be, unreliable, were, still, used, by, sunni, jurists, for, non, core, areas, of, law, western, scholars, are, generally, skeptical, of, the, value, of, hadith, for, understanding, the, true, historical, muhammad, even, those, considered, sahih, by, muslim, scholars, due, to, their, first, recording, centuries, after, muhammad, s, life, the, unverifiability, of, the, claimed, chains, of, transmission, and, the, widespread, creation, of, fraudulent, hadiths, western, scholars, instead, see, hadith, as, more, valuable, for, recording, later, developments, in, islamic, theology, in, arabic, the, noun, ad, th, ipa, means, report, account, or, narrative, its, arabic, plural, is, a, d, th, hadith, also, refers, to, the, speech, of, a, person, in, islamic, terminology, according, to, juan, campo, the, term, hadith, refers, to, reports, of, statements, or, actions, of, muhammad, or, of, his, tacit, approval, or, criticism, of, something, said, or, done, in, his, presence, classical, hadith, specialist, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, says, that, the, intended, meaning, of, hadith, in, religious, tradition, is, something, attributed, to, muhammad, but, that, is, not, found, in, the, quran, scholar, patricia, crone, includes, reports, by, others, than, muhammad, in, her, definition, of, hadith, short, reports, sometimes, just, a, line, or, two, recording, what, an, early, figure, such, as, a, companion, of, the, prophet, or, muhammad, himself, said, or, did, on, a, particular, occasion, preceded, by, a, chain, of, transmitters, however, she, adds, that, nowadays, hadith, almost, always, means, hadith, from, muhammad, himself, in, contrast, according, to, the, shia, islam, ahlul, bayt, digital, library, project, when, there, is, no, clear, qur, anic, statement, nor, is, there, a, hadith, upon, which, muslim, schools, have, agreed, shi, a, refer, to, ahlul, bayt, to, derive, the, sunnah, of, the, prophet, implying, that, while, hadith, is, limited, to, the, traditions, of, muhammad, the, shi, a, sunna, draws, on, the, sayings, etc, of, the, ahlul, bayt, i, e, the, imams, of, shi, a, islam, the, word, sunnah, is, also, used, in, reference, to, a, normative, custom, of, muhammad, or, the, early, muslim, community, joseph, schacht, describes, hadith, as, providing, the, documentation, of, the, sunnah, another, source, joseph, a, islam, distinguishes, between, the, two, saying, whereas, the, hadith, is, an, oral, communication, that, is, allegedly, derived, from, the, prophet, or, his, teachings, the, sunna, quite, literally, mode, of, life, behaviour, or, example, signifies, the, prevailing, customs, of, a, particular, community, or, people, a, sunna, is, a, practice, which, has, been, passed, on, by, a, community, from, generation, to, generation, en, masse, whereas, the, hadith, are, reports, collected, by, later, compilers, often, centuries, removed, from, the, source, a, practice, which, is, contained, within, the, hadith, may, well, be, regarded, as, sunna, but, it, is, not, necessary, that, a, sunna, would, have, a, supporting, hadith, sanctioning, it, some, sources, khaled, abou, el, fadl, limit, hadith, to, verbal, reports, with, the, deeds, of, muhammad, and, reports, about, his, companions, being, part, of, the, sunnah, but, not, hadith, islamic, literary, classifications, similar, to, hadith, but, not, sunnah, are, maghazi, and, sira, they, differ, from, hadith, in, that, they, are, organized, relatively, chronologically, rather, than, by, subject, other, traditions, of, islam, related, to, hadith, include, the, hadith, literature, in, use, today, is, based, on, spoken, reports, in, circulation, after, the, death, of, muhammad, hadith, were, not, promptly, written, down, during, muhammad, s, lifetime, or, immediately, after, his, death, hadith, were, evaluated, orally, to, written, and, gathered, into, large, collections, during, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, generations, after, muhammad, s, death, after, the, end, of, the, era, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, over, 1, 000, km, 600, mi, from, where, muhammad, lived, many, thousands, of, times, more, numerous, than, the, verses, of, the, quran, hadith, have, been, described, as, resembling, layers, surrounding, the, core, of, islamic, beliefs, the, quran, well, known, widely, accepted, hadith, make, up, the, narrow, inner, layer, with, a, hadith, becoming, less, reliable, and, accepted, with, each, layer, stretching, outward, the, reports, of, muhammad, s, and, sometimes, his, companions, behavior, collected, by, hadith, compilers, include, details, of, ritual, religious, practice, such, as, the, five, salat, obligatory, islamic, prayers, that, are, not, found, in, the, quran, as, well, as, everyday, behavior, such, as, table, manners, dress, and, posture, hadith, are, also, regarded, by, muslims, as, important, tools, for, understanding, things, mentioned, in, the, quran, but, not, explained, a, source, for, tafsir, commentaries, written, on, the, quran, some, important, elements, which, are, today, taken, to, be, a, long, held, part, of, islamic, practice, and, belief, are, not, mentioned, in, the, quran, but, are, reported, in, hadiths, therefore, muslims, usually, maintain, that, hadiths, are, a, necessary, requirement, for, the, true, and, proper, practice, of, islam, as, it, gives, muslims, the, nuanced, details, of, islamic, practice, and, belief, in, areas, where, the, quran, is, silent, an, example, is, the, obligatory, prayers, which, are, commanded, in, the, quran, but, explained, in, hadith, details, of, the, prescribed, movements, and, words, of, the, prayer, known, as, rak, a, and, how, many, times, they, are, to, be, performed, are, found, in, hadith, however, hadiths, differ, on, these, details, and, consequently, salat, is, performed, differently, by, different, hadithist, islamic, sects, quranists, on, the, other, hand, believe, that, if, the, quran, is, silent, on, some, matter, it, is, because, god, did, not, hold, its, detail, to, be, of, consequence, and, that, some, hadith, contradict, the, quran, proving, that, some, hadith, are, a, source, of, corruption, and, not, a, complement, to, the, quran, joseph, schacht, quotes, a, hadith, of, muhammad, that, is, used, to, justify, reference, in, islamic, law, to, the, companions, of, muhammad, as, religious, authorities, my, companions, are, like, lodestars, according, to, schacht, and, other, scholars, in, the, very, first, generations, after, the, death, of, muhammad, use, of, hadith, from, sahabah, companions, of, muhammad, and, tabi, un, successors, of, the, companions, was, the, rule, while, use, of, hadith, of, muhammad, himself, by, muslims, was, the, exception, schacht, credits, al, shafi, i, founder, of, the, shafi, i, school, of, fiqh, or, madh, hab, with, establishing, the, principle, of, the, using, the, hadith, of, muhammad, for, islamic, law, and, emphasizing, the, inferiority, of, hadith, of, anyone, else, saying, hadiths, from, other, persons, are, of, no, account, in, the, face, of, a, tradition, from, the, prophet, whether, they, confirm, or, contradict, it, if, the, other, persons, had, been, aware, of, the, tradition, from, the, prophet, they, would, have, followed, it, this, led, to, the, almost, complete, neglect, of, traditions, from, the, companions, and, others, collections, of, hadith, sometimes, mix, those, of, muhammad, with, the, reports, of, others, muwatta, imam, malik, is, usually, described, as, the, earliest, written, collection, of, hadith, but, sayings, of, muhammad, are, blended, with, the, sayings, of, the, companions, 822, hadith, from, muhammad, and, 898, from, others, according, to, the, count, of, one, edition, in, introduction, to, hadith, by, abd, al, hadi, al, fadli, kitab, ali, is, referred, to, as, the, first, hadith, book, of, the, ahl, al, bayt, family, of, muhammad, to, be, written, on, the, authority, of, the, prophet, however, the, acts, statements, or, approvals, of, muhammad, are, called, marfu, hadith, while, those, of, companions, are, called, mawquf, hadith, and, those, of, tabi, un, are, called, maqtu, hadith, the, hadith, had, a, profound, and, controversial, influence, on, tafsir, commentaries, of, the, quran, the, earliest, commentary, of, the, quran, known, as, tafsir, ibn, abbas, is, sometimes, attributed, to, the, companion, ibn, abbas, the, hadith, were, used, the, form, the, basis, of, sharia, the, religious, law, system, forming, part, of, the, islamic, tradition, and, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, the, hadith, are, at, the, root, of, why, there, is, no, single, fiqh, system, but, rather, a, collection, of, parallel, systems, within, islam, much, of, the, early, islamic, history, available, today, is, also, based, on, the, hadith, although, it, has, been, challenged, for, its, lack, of, basis, in, primary, source, material, and, the, internal, contradictions, of, available, secondary, material, the, hadith, have, been, called, by, american, sunni, scholar, jonathan, a, c, brown, as, the, backbone, of, islamic, civilization, hadith, may, be, hadith, qudsi, sacred, hadith, which, some, muslims, regard, as, the, words, of, god, or, hadith, sharif, noble, hadith, which, are, muhammad, s, own, utterances, according, to, as, sayyid, ash, sharif, al, jurjani, the, hadith, qudsi, differ, from, the, quran, in, that, the, former, are, expressed, in, muhammad, s, words, whereas, the, latter, are, the, direct, words, of, god, a, hadith, qudsi, need, not, be, a, sahih, sound, hadith, but, may, be, da, if, or, even, mawdu, an, example, of, a, hadith, qudsi, is, the, hadith, of, abu, hurairah, who, said, that, muhammad, said, when, god, decreed, the, creation, he, pledged, himself, by, writing, in, his, book, which, is, laid, down, with, him, my, mercy, prevails, over, my, wrath, in, the, shia, school, of, thought, there, are, two, fundamental, viewpoints, of, hadith, the, usuli, view, and, the, akhbari, view, the, usuli, scholars, emphasize, the, importance, of, scientific, examination, of, hadiths, through, ijtihad, while, the, akhbari, scholars, consider, all, hadiths, from, the, four, shia, books, as, authentic, the, two, major, aspects, of, a, hadith, are, the, text, of, the, report, the, matn, which, contains, the, actual, narrative, and, the, chain, of, narrators, the, isnad, which, documents, the, route, by, which, the, report, has, been, transmitted, the, isnad, was, an, effort, to, document, that, a, hadith, actually, came, from, muhammad, and, muslim, scholars, from, the, eighth, century, to, the, present, have, never, ceased, to, repeat, the, mantra, the, isnad, is, part, of, the, religion, if, not, for, the, isnad, whoever, wanted, could, say, whatever, they, wanted, the, isnad, literally, means, support, and, it, is, so, named, because, hadith, specialists, rely, on, it, to, determine, the, authenticity, or, weakness, of, a, hadith, the, isnad, consists, of, a, chronological, list, of, the, narrators, each, mentioning, the, one, from, whom, they, heard, the, hadith, until, mentioning, the, originator, of, the, matn, along, with, the, matn, itself, the, first, people, to, hear, hadith, were, the, companions, who, preserved, it, and, then, conveyed, it, to, those, after, them, then, the, generation, following, them, received, it, thus, conveying, it, to, those, after, them, and, so, on, so, a, companion, would, say, i, heard, the, prophet, say, such, and, such, the, follower, would, then, say, i, heard, a, companion, say, i, heard, the, prophet, the, one, after, him, would, then, say, i, heard, someone, say, i, heard, a, companion, say, i, heard, the, prophet, and, so, on, different, branches, of, islam, refer, to, different, collections, of, hadith, although, the, same, incident, may, be, found, in, hadith, from, different, collections, in, general, the, difference, between, shi, a, and, sunni, collections, is, that, shia, give, preference, to, hadiths, attributed, to, muhammad, s, family, and, close, companions, ahl, al, bayt, while, sunnis, do, not, consider, family, lineage, in, evaluating, hadith, and, sunnah, narrated, by, any, of, twelve, thousand, companions, of, muhammad, traditions, of, the, life, of, muhammad, and, the, early, history, of, islam, were, passed, down, mostly, orally, for, more, than, a, hundred, years, after, muhammad, s, death, in, ad, 632, muslim, historians, say, that, caliph, uthman, ibn, affan, the, third, khalifa, caliph, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, or, third, successor, of, muhammad, who, had, formerly, been, muhammad, s, secretary, is, generally, credited, with, urging, muslims, to, record, the, hadith, just, as, muhammad, had, suggested, that, some, of, his, followers, to, write, down, his, words, and, actions, uthman, s, labours, were, cut, short, by, his, assassination, at, the, hands, of, aggrieved, soldiers, in, 656, no, direct, sources, survive, directly, from, this, period, so, we, are, dependent, on, what, later, writers, tell, us, about, this, period, according, to, british, historian, of, arab, world, alfred, guillaume, it, is, certain, that, several, small, collections, of, hadith, were, assembled, in, umayyad, times, in, islamic, law, the, use, of, hadith, as, it, is, understood, today, hadith, of, muhammad, with, documentation, isnads, etc, came, gradually, according, to, scholars, such, as, joseph, schacht, ignaz, goldziher, and, daniel, w, brown, early, schools, of, islamic, jurisprudence, used, the, rulings, of, the, prophet, s, companions, the, rulings, of, the, caliphs, and, practices, that, had, gained, general, acceptance, among, the, jurists, of, that, school, on, his, deathbed, caliph, umar, instructed, muslims, to, seek, guidance, from, the, quran, the, early, muslims, muhajirun, who, emigrated, to, medina, with, muhammad, the, medina, residents, who, welcomed, and, supported, the, muhajirun, the, ansar, and, the, people, of, the, desert, according, to, the, scholars, harald, motzki, and, daniel, w, brown, the, earliest, islamic, legal, reasonings, that, have, come, down, to, us, were, virtually, hadith, free, but, gradually, over, the, course, of, second, century, a, h, the, infiltration, and, incorporation, of, prophetic, hadiths, into, islamic, jurisprudence, took, place, it, was, ab, abdull, h, muhammad, ibn, idr, s, al, sh, fi, 150, 204, ah, known, as, al, shafi, i, who, emphasized, the, final, authority, of, a, hadith, of, muhammad, so, that, even, the, quran, was, to, be, interpreted, in, the, light, of, traditions, i, e, hadith, and, not, vice, versa, while, traditionally, the, qur, an, has, traditionally, been, considered, superior, in, authority, to, the, sunna, al, shafi, i, forcefully, argued, that, the, sunna, was, on, equal, footing, with, the, quran, according, to, scholar, daniel, brown, for, as, al, shafi, i, put, it, the, command, of, the, prophet, is, the, command, of, god, in, 851, the, rationalist, mu, tazila, school, of, thought, fell, out, of, favor, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, the, mu, tazila, for, whom, the, judge, of, truth, was, human, reason, had, clashed, with, traditionists, who, looked, to, the, literal, meaning, of, the, quran, and, hadith, for, truth, while, the, quran, had, been, officially, compiled, and, approved, hadiths, had, not, one, result, was, the, number, of, hadiths, began, multiplying, in, suspiciously, direct, correlation, to, their, utility, to, the, quoter, of, the, hadith, traditionists, quoted, hadith, warning, against, listening, to, human, opinion, instead, of, sharia, hanafites, quoted, a, hadith, stating, that, in, my, community, there, will, rise, a, man, called, abu, hanifa, who, will, be, its, guiding, light, in, fact, one, agreed, upon, hadith, warned, that, there, will, be, forgers, liars, who, will, bring, you, hadiths, which, neither, you, nor, your, forefathers, have, heard, beware, of, them, in, addition, the, number, of, hadith, grew, enormously, while, malik, ibn, anas, had, attributed, just, 1720, statements, or, deeds, to, the, muhammad, it, was, no, longer, unusual, to, find, people, who, had, collected, a, hundred, times, that, number, of, hadith, faced, with, a, huge, corpus, of, miscellaneous, traditions, supporting, different, views, on, a, wide, variety, of, controversial, matters, some, of, them, flatly, contradicting, each, other, islamic, scholars, of, the, abbasid, period, sought, to, authenticate, hadith, scholars, had, to, decide, which, hadith, were, to, be, trusted, as, authentic, and, which, had, been, fabricated, for, political, or, theological, purposes, to, do, this, they, used, a, number, of, techniques, which, muslims, now, call, the, science, of, hadith, the, earliest, surviving, hadith, manuscripts, were, copied, on, papyrus, a, long, scroll, collects, traditions, transmitted, by, the, scholar, and, qadi, abd, all, h, ibn, lah, a, d, 790, a, ad, th, d, w, d, history, of, david, attributed, to, wahb, ibn, munabbih, survives, in, a, manuscript, dated, 844, a, collection, of, hadiths, dedicated, to, invocations, to, god, attributed, to, a, certain, kh, lid, ibn, yaz, d, is, dated, 880, 881, a, consistent, fragment, of, the, j, mi, of, the, egyptian, maliki, jurist, abd, all, h, ibn, wahb, d, 813, is, finally, dated, to, 889, sunni, and, shia, hadith, collections, differ, because, scholars, from, the, two, traditions, differ, as, to, the, reliability, of, the, narrators, and, transmitters, narrators, who, sided, with, abu, bakr, and, umar, rather, than, ali, in, the, disputes, over, leadership, that, followed, the, death, of, muhammad, are, considered, unreliable, by, the, shia, narrations, attributed, to, ali, and, the, family, of, muhammad, and, to, their, supporters, are, preferred, sunni, scholars, put, trust, in, narrators, such, as, aisha, whom, shia, reject, differences, in, hadith, collections, have, contributed, to, differences, in, worship, practices, and, shari, a, law, and, have, hardened, the, dividing, line, between, the, two, traditions, in, the, sunni, tradition, the, number, of, such, texts, is, somewhere, between, seven, and, thirteen, thousand, but, the, number, of, hadiths, is, far, greater, because, several, isnad, sharing, the, same, text, are, each, counted, as, individual, hadith, if, say, ten, companions, record, a, text, reporting, a, single, incident, in, the, life, of, muhammad, hadith, scholars, can, count, this, as, ten, hadiths, thus, musnad, ahmad, for, example, has, over, 30, 000, hadiths, but, this, count, includes, texts, that, are, repeated, in, order, to, record, slight, variations, within, the, text, or, within, the, chains, of, narrations, identifying, the, narrators, of, the, various, texts, comparing, their, narrations, of, the, same, texts, to, identify, both, the, soundest, reporting, of, a, text, and, the, reporters, who, are, most, sound, in, their, reporting, occupied, experts, of, hadith, throughout, the, 2nd, century, in, the, 3rd, century, of, islam, from, 225, 840, to, about, 275, 889, hadith, experts, composed, brief, works, recording, a, selection, of, about, two, to, five, thousand, such, texts, which, they, felt, to, have, been, most, soundly, documented, or, most, widely, referred, to, in, the, muslim, scholarly, community, the, 4th, and, 5th, century, saw, these, six, works, being, commented, on, quite, widely, this, auxiliary, literature, has, contributed, to, making, their, study, the, place, of, departure, for, any, serious, study, of, hadith, in, addition, bukhari, and, muslim, in, particular, claimed, that, they, were, collecting, only, the, soundest, of, sound, hadiths, these, later, scholars, tested, their, claims, and, agreed, to, them, so, that, today, they, are, considered, the, most, reliable, collections, of, hadith, toward, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, ibn, al, qaisarani, formally, standardized, the, sunni, canon, into, six, pivotal, works, a, delineation, which, remains, to, this, day, over, the, centuries, several, different, categories, of, collections, have, emerged, some, are, more, general, such, as, the, mu, annaf, the, mu, jam, and, the, j, mi, and, some, more, specific, characterized, either, by, the, subjects, covered, such, as, the, sunan, restricted, to, legal, liturgical, traditions, or, by, their, s, composition, such, as, the, arba, niyy, t, collections, of, forty, hadiths, shi, a, muslims, seldom, if, ever, use, the, six, major, hadith, collections, followed, by, the, sunnis, because, they, do, not, trust, many, of, the, sunni, narrators, and, transmitters, they, have, their, own, extensive, hadith, literature, the, best, known, hadith, collections, are, the, four, books, which, were, compiled, by, three, authors, who, are, known, as, the, three, muhammads, the, four, books, are, kitab, al, kafi, by, muhammad, ibn, ya, qub, al, kulayni, al, razi, 329, ah, man, la, yahduruhu, al, faqih, by, muhammad, ibn, babuya, and, al, tahdhib, and, al, istibsar, both, by, shaykh, muhammad, tusi, shi, a, clerics, also, make, use, of, extensive, collections, and, commentaries, by, later, authors, unlike, sunnis, the, majority, of, shia, do, not, consider, any, of, their, hadith, collections, to, be, sahih, authentic, in, their, entirety, therefore, each, individual, hadith, in, a, specific, collection, must, be, investigated, separately, to, determine, its, authenticity, the, akhbari, school, however, considers, all, the, hadith, from, the, four, books, to, be, authentic, the, importance, of, hadith, in, the, shia, school, of, thought, is, well, documented, this, can, be, captured, by, ali, ibn, abi, talib, cousin, of, muhammad, when, he, narrated, that, whoever, of, our, shia, followers, knows, our, shariah, and, takes, out, the, weak, of, our, followers, from, the, darkness, of, ignorance, to, the, light, of, knowledge, hadith, which, we, ahl, al, bayt, have, gifted, to, them, he, on, the, day, of, judgement, will, come, with, a, crown, on, his, head, it, will, shine, among, the, people, gathered, on, the, plain, of, resurrection, hassan, al, askari, a, descendant, of, muhammad, gave, support, to, this, narration, stating, whoever, he, had, taken, out, in, the, worldly, life, from, the, darkness, of, ignorance, can, hold, to, his, light, to, be, taken, out, of, the, darkness, of, the, plain, of, resurrection, to, the, garden, paradise, then, all, those, whomever, he, had, taught, in, the, worldly, life, anything, of, goodness, or, had, opened, from, his, heart, a, lock, of, ignorance, or, had, removed, his, doubts, will, come, out, regarding, the, importance, of, maintaining, accuracy, in, recording, hadith, it, has, been, documented, that, muhammad, al, baqir, the, great, grandson, of, muhammad, has, said, that, holding, back, in, a, doubtful, issue, is, better, than, entering, destruction, your, not, narrating, a, hadith, is, better, than, you, narrating, a, hadith, in, which, you, have, not, studied, thoroughly, on, every, truth, there, is, a, reality, above, every, right, thing, there, is, a, light, whatever, agrees, with, the, book, of, allah, you, must, take, it, and, whatever, disagrees, you, must, leave, it, alone, 10, al, baqir, also, emphasized, the, selfless, devotion, of, ahl, al, bayt, to, preserving, the, traditions, of, muhammad, through, his, conversation, with, jabir, ibn, abd, allah, an, old, companion, of, muhammad, he, al, baqir, said, oh, jabir, had, we, spoken, to, you, from, our, opinions, and, desires, we, would, be, counted, among, those, who, are, destroyed, we, speak, to, you, of, the, hadith, which, we, treasure, from, the, messenger, of, allah, oh, allah, grant, compensation, to, muhammad, and, his, family, worthy, of, their, services, to, your, cause, just, as, they, treasure, their, gold, and, silver, further, it, has, been, narrated, that, ja, far, al, sadiq, the, son, of, al, baqir, has, said, the, following, regarding, hadith, you, must, write, it, down, you, will, not, memorize, until, you, write, it, down, 33, hadith, as, an, interpretation, of, the, holy, quran, move, not, your, tongue, with, it, to, hasten, with, recitation, of, it, indeed, upon, us, is, its, collection, and, its, recitation, so, when, we, have, recited, it, then, follow, its, recitation, then, upon, us, is, interpretation, surah, al, qiyamah, verse, 16, 19, the, mainstream, sects, consider, hadith, to, be, essential, supplements, to, and, clarifications, of, the, quran, islam, s, holy, book, as, well, as, for, clarifying, issues, pertaining, to, islamic, jurisprudence, ibn, al, salah, a, hadith, specialist, described, the, relationship, between, hadith, and, other, aspects, of, the, religion, by, saying, it, is, the, science, most, pervasive, in, respect, to, the, other, sciences, in, their, various, branches, in, particular, to, jurisprudence, being, the, most, important, of, them, the, intended, meaning, of, other, sciences, here, are, those, pertaining, to, religion, explains, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, quranic, exegesis, hadith, and, jurisprudence, the, science, of, hadith, became, the, most, pervasive, due, to, the, need, displayed, by, each, of, these, three, sciences, the, need, hadith, has, of, its, science, is, apparent, as, for, quranic, exegesis, then, the, preferred, manner, of, explaining, the, speech, of, god, is, by, means, of, what, has, been, accepted, as, a, statement, of, muhammad, the, one, looking, to, this, is, in, need, of, distinguishing, the, acceptable, from, the, unacceptable, regarding, jurisprudence, then, the, jurist, is, in, need, of, citing, as, an, evidence, the, acceptable, to, the, exception, of, the, later, something, only, possible, utilizing, the, science, of, hadith, western, scholarly, criticism, of, hadith, began, in, colonial, india, in, the, mid, 19th, century, with, the, works, of, aloys, sprenger, and, william, muir, these, works, were, generally, critical, of, the, reliability, of, hadith, suggesting, that, traditional, muslim, scholarship, was, incapable, of, determining, the, authenticity, of, hadith, and, that, the, hadith, tradition, had, been, corrupted, by, widespread, fabrication, of, fraudulent, hadith, the, late, 19th, century, work, of, ignaz, goldziher, muhammedanische, studien, muslim, studies, is, considered, seminal, in, the, field, of, western, hadith, studies, goldziher, took, the, same, critical, approach, as, sprenger, and, muir, suggesting, that, many, hadith, showed, anachronistic, elements, indicating, that, they, were, not, authentic, and, that, the, many, contradictory, hadith, made, the, value, of, the, entire, corpus, questionable, the, work, of, joseph, schacht, in, the, 1950s, sought, to, obtain, a, critical, understanding, of, the, chains, of, transmission, of, particular, hadith, focusing, on, the, convergence, of, transmission, chains, of, particular, hadith, back, to, a, single, common, link, from, who, all, later, sources, ultimately, obtained, the, hadith, who, schacht, considered, to, be, the, likely, true, author, of, the, hadith, which, could, allow, dating, of, when, particular, hadith, began, circulating, this, method, is, widely, influential, in, western, hadith, scholarship, though, has, received, criticism, from, some, scholars, some, modern, scholars, have, contested, schacht, s, assertion, that, the, common, links, were, likely, forgers, of, the, hadith, instead, suggesting, that, they, were, avid, collectors, of, hadiths, though, their, arguments, for, this, have, been, criticised, by, other, scholars, authenticity, of, a, hadith, is, primarily, verified, by, its, chain, of, transmission, isnad, because, a, chain, of, transmission, can, be, a, forgery, the, status, of, authenticity, given, by, muslim, scholars, are, not, generally, accepted, by, orientalists, or, historians, who, largely, consider, hadith, to, be, unverifiable, ignaz, goldziherr, demonstrated, that, several, hadiths, do, not, fit, the, time, of, muhammad, chronologically, and, content, wise, as, a, result, orientalists, generally, regard, hadiths, as, having, little, value, in, understanding, the, life, and, times, of, the, historical, muhammad, but, are, instead, valuable, for, understanding, later, theological, developments, in, the, muslim, community, according, to, bernard, lewis, in, the, early, islamic, centuries, there, could, be, no, better, way, of, promoting, a, cause, an, opinion, or, a, faction, than, to, cite, an, appropriate, action, or, utterance, of, the, prophet, to, fight, these, forgeries, the, elaborate, tradition, of, hadith, sciences, was, devised, to, authenticate, hadith, known, as, ilm, al, jarh, or, ilm, al, dirayah, hadith, science, use, a, number, of, methods, of, evaluation, developed, by, early, muslim, scholars, in, determining, the, veracity, of, reports, attributed, to, muhammad, this, is, achieved, by, based, on, these, criteria, various, classifications, of, hadith, have, been, developed, the, earliest, comprehensive, work, in, hadith, science, was, abu, muhammad, al, ramahurmuzi, s, al, muhaddith, al, fasil, while, another, significant, work, was, al, hakim, al, naysaburi, s, ma, rifat, ulum, al, hadith, ibn, al, salah, s, ulum, al, hadith, is, considered, the, standard, classical, reference, on, hadith, science, some, schools, of, hadith, methodology, apply, as, many, as, sixteen, separate, tests, biographical, analysis, ilm, al, rij, l, lit, science, of, people, also, science, of, asma, al, rijal, or, ilm, al, jar, wa, al, ta, d, l, science, of, discrediting, and, accrediting, in, which, details, about, the, transmitter, are, scrutinized, this, includes, analyzing, their, date, and, place, of, birth, familial, connections, teachers, and, students, religiosity, moral, behaviour, literary, output, their, travels, as, well, as, their, date, of, death, based, upon, these, criteria, the, reliability, thiq, t, of, the, transmitter, is, assessed, it, is, also, determined, whether, the, individual, was, actually, able, to, transmit, the, report, which, is, deduced, from, their, contemporaneity, and, geographical, proximity, with, the, other, transmitters, in, the, chain, examples, of, biographical, dictionaries, include, abd, al, ghani, al, maqdisi, s, al, kamal, fi, asma, al, rijal, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, s, tahdh, b, al, tahdh, b, and, al, dhahabi, s, tadhkirat, al, huffaz, hadith, on, matters, of, importance, needed, to, come, through, a, number, of, independent, chains, this, was, known, as, the, scale, of, transmission, reports, that, passed, through, many, reliable, transmitters, in, many, isnad, up, until, their, collection, and, transcription, are, known, as, mutaw, tir, these, reports, are, considered, the, most, authoritative, as, they, pass, through, so, many, different, routes, that, collusion, between, all, of, the, transmitters, becomes, an, impossibility, reports, not, meeting, this, standard, are, known, as, aahad, and, are, of, several, different, types, according, to, muhammad, shafi, hadith, whose, isnad, has, been, scrutinized, then, have, their, text, or, matn, examined, for, having, been, evaluated, hadith, may, be, categorized, two, categories, are, other, classifications, include, both, sah, h, and, hasan, reports, are, considered, acceptable, for, usage, in, islamic, legal, discourse, the, major, points, of, intra, muslim, criticism, of, the, hadith, literature, is, based, in, questions, regarding, its, authenticity, however, muslim, criticism, of, hadith, is, also, based, on, theological, and, philosophical, islamic, grounds, of, argument, and, critique, historically, some, sects, of, the, kharijites, rejected, the, hadith, there, were, some, who, opposed, even, the, writing, down, of, the, hadith, itself, for, fear, that, it, would, compete, or, even, replace, the, qur, an, mu, tazilites, also, rejected, the, hadiths, as, the, basis, for, islamic, law, while, at, the, same, time, accepting, the, sunnah, and, ijma, for, mu, tazilites, the, basic, argument, for, rejecting, the, hadiths, was, that, since, its, essence, is, transmission, by, individuals, cannot, be, a, sure, avenue, of, our, knowledge, about, the, prophetic, teaching, unlike, the, qur, an, about, whose, transmission, there, is, a, universal, unanimity, among, muslims, with, regard, to, clarity, imam, ali, al, ridha, has, narrated, that, in, our, hadith, there, are, mutashabih, unclear, ones, like, those, in, al, quran, as, well, as, muhkam, clear, ones, like, those, of, al, quran, you, must, refer, the, unclear, ones, to, the, clear, ones, 15, muslim, scholars, have, a, long, history, of, questioning, the, hadith, literature, throughout, islamic, history, western, academics, also, became, active, in, the, field, later, in, hadith, studies, starting, in, 1890, but, much, more, often, since, 1950, some, muslim, critics, of, hadith, even, go, so, far, as, to, completely, reject, them, as, the, basic, texts, of, islam, and, instead, adhere, to, the, movement, called, quranism, quranists, argue, that, the, quran, itself, does, not, contain, an, invitation, to, accept, hadith, as, a, second, theological, source, alongside, the, quran, the, expression, to, obey, god, and, the, messenger, which, occurs, among, others, in, 3, 132, or, 4, 69, is, understood, to, mean, that, one, follows, the, messenger, whose, task, it, was, to, convey, the, quran, by, following, the, quran, alone, muhammad, is, so, to, speak, a, mediator, from, god, to, people, through, the, quran, alone, and, not, through, hadith, according, to, quranists, both, modernist, muslims, and, qur, anists, believe, that, the, problems, in, the, islamic, world, come, partly, from, the, traditional, elements, of, the, hadith, and, seek, to, reject, those, teachings, among, the, most, prominent, muslim, critics, of, hadith, in, modern, times, are, the, egyptian, rashad, khalifa, who, became, known, as, the, discoverer, of, the, quran, code, code, 19, the, malaysian, kassim, ahmad, and, the, american, turkish, edip, y, ksel, quranism, western, scholars, notably, ignaz, goldziher, and, joseph, schacht, among, others, have, criticised, traditional, hadith, sciences, as, being, almost, entirely, focused, on, scrutinizing, the, chain, of, transmittors, isnad, rather, than, the, actual, contents, of, the, hadith, matn, and, that, scrutiny, of, isnad, cannot, determine, the, authenticity, of, a, hadith, many, western, scholars, suspect, that, there, was, widespread, fabrication, of, hadith, either, entirely, or, by, the, misattribution, of, the, views, of, early, muslim, religious, and, legal, thinkers, to, muhammad, in, the, early, centuries, of, islam, to, support, certain, theological, and, legal, positions, in, addition, to, fabrication, it, is, possible, for, the, meaning, of, a, hadith, to, have, greatly, drifted, from, its, original, telling, through, the, different, interpretations, and, biases, of, its, varying, transmitters, even, if, the, chain, of, transmission, is, authentic, while, some, hadith, may, genuinely, originate, from, firsthand, observation, of, muhammad, particularly, personal, traits, that, were, not, of, theological, interest, like, his, fondness, for, tharid, and, sweets, western, scholars, suggest, that, it, is, extraordinarily, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, determine, which, hadith, accurately, reflect, the, historical, muhammad, hadith, scholar, muhammad, mustafa, azmi, has, disputed, the, claims, made, by, western, scholars, about, the, reliability, of, traditional, hadith, criticism
