religious, or, political, reasons, people, who, engage, in, or, support, iconoclasm, are, called, iconoclasts, a, term, that, has, come, to, be, figuratively, applied, to, any, individual, who, challenges, cherished, beliefs, or, venerated, institutions, on, the, grounds, that, they, are, erroneous, or, pernicious, conversely, one, who, reveres, or, venerates, religious, images, is, called, by, iconoclasts, an, iconolater, in, a, byzantine, context, such, a, person, is, called, an, iconodule, or, iconophile, iconoclasm, does, not, generally, encompass, the, destruction, of, the, images, of, a, specific, ruler, after, his, or, her, death, or, overthrow, a, practice, better, known, as, damnatio, memoriae, while, iconoclasm, may, be, carried, out, by, adherents, of, a, different, religion, it, is, more, commonly, the, result, of, sectarian, disputes, between, factions, of, the, same, religion, the, term, originates, from, the, byzantine, iconoclasm, the, struggles, between, proponents, and, opponents, of, religious, icons, in, the, byzantine, empire, from, 726, to, 842, ad, degrees, of, iconoclasm, vary, greatly, among, religions, and, their, branches, but, are, strongest, in, religions, which, oppose, idolatry, including, the, abrahamic, religions, outside, of, the, religious, context, iconoclasm, can, refer, to, movements, for, widespread, destruction, in, symbols, of, an, ideology, or, cause, such, as, the, destruction, of, monarchist, symbols, during, the, french, revolution, in, the, bronze, age, the, most, significant, episode, of, iconoclasm, occurred, in, egypt, during, the, amarna, period, when, akhenaten, based, in, his, new, capital, of, akhetaten, instituted, a, significant, shift, in, egyptian, artistic, styles, alongside, a, campaign, of, intolerance, towards, the, traditional, gods, and, a, new, emphasis, on, a, state, monolatristic, tradition, focused, on, the, god, aten, the, sun, disk, many, temples, and, monuments, were, destroyed, as, a, result, in, rebellion, against, the, old, religion, and, the, powerful, priests, of, amun, akhenaten, ordered, the, eradication, of, all, of, egypt, s, traditional, gods, he, sent, royal, officials, to, chisel, out, and, destroy, every, reference, to, amun, and, the, names, of, other, deities, on, tombs, temple, walls, and, cartouches, to, instill, in, the, people, that, the, aten, was, the, one, true, god, public, references, to, akhenaten, were, destroyed, soon, after, his, death, comparing, the, ancient, egyptians, with, the, israelites, jan, assmann, writes, for, egypt, the, greatest, horror, was, the, destruction, or, abduction, of, the, cult, images, in, the, eyes, of, the, israelites, the, erection, of, images, meant, the, destruction, of, divine, presence, in, the, eyes, of, the, egyptians, this, same, effect, was, attained, by, the, destruction, of, images, in, egypt, iconoclasm, was, the, most, terrible, religious, crime, in, israel, the, most, terrible, religious, crime, was, idolatry, in, this, respect, osarseph, alias, akhenaten, the, iconoclast, and, the, golden, calf, the, paragon, of, idolatry, correspond, to, each, other, inversely, and, it, is, strange, that, aaron, could, so, easily, avoid, the, role, of, the, religious, criminal, it, is, more, than, probable, that, these, traditions, evolved, under, mutual, influence, in, this, respect, moses, and, akhenaten, became, after, all, closely, related, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, god, instructed, the, israelites, to, destroy, all, engraved, stones, destroy, all, molded, images, and, demolish, all, high, places, of, the, indigenous, canaanite, population, as, soon, as, they, entered, the, promised, land, in, judaism, king, hezekiah, purged, solomon, s, temple, in, jerusalem, and, all, figures, were, also, destroyed, in, the, land, of, israel, including, the, nehushtan, as, recorded, in, the, second, book, of, kings, his, reforms, were, reversed, in, the, reign, of, his, son, manasseh, scattered, expressions, of, opposition, to, the, use, of, images, have, been, reported, the, synod, of, elvira, appeared, to, endorse, iconoclasm, canon, 36, states, pictures, are, not, to, be, placed, in, churches, so, that, they, do, not, become, objects, of, worship, and, adoration, a, possible, translation, is, also, there, shall, be, no, pictures, in, the, church, lest, what, is, worshipped, and, adored, should, be, depicted, on, the, walls, the, date, of, this, canon, is, disputed, proscription, ceased, after, the, destruction, of, pagan, temples, however, widespread, use, of, christian, iconography, only, began, as, christianity, increasingly, spread, among, gentiles, after, the, legalization, of, christianity, by, roman, emperor, constantine, c, 312, ad, during, the, process, of, christianisation, under, constantine, christian, groups, destroyed, the, images, and, sculptures, expressive, of, the, roman, empire, s, polytheist, state, religion, among, early, church, theologians, iconoclastic, tendencies, were, supported, by, theologians, such, as, tertullian, clement, of, alexandria, origen, lactantius, justin, martyr, eusebius, and, epiphanius, the, period, after, the, reign, of, byzantine, emperor, justinian, 527, 565, evidently, saw, a, huge, increase, in, the, use, of, images, both, in, volume, and, quality, and, a, gathering, aniconic, reaction, one, notable, change, within, the, byzantine, empire, came, in, 695, when, justinian, ii, s, government, added, a, full, face, image, of, christ, on, the, obverse, of, imperial, gold, coins, the, change, caused, the, caliph, abd, al, malik, to, stop, his, earlier, adoption, of, byzantine, coin, types, he, started, a, purely, islamic, coinage, with, lettering, only, a, letter, by, the, patriarch, germanus, written, before, 726, to, two, iconoclast, bishops, says, that, now, whole, towns, and, multitudes, of, people, are, in, considerable, agitation, over, this, matter, but, there, is, little, written, evidence, of, the, debate, government, led, iconoclasm, began, with, byzantine, emperor, leo, iii, who, issued, a, series, of, edicts, between, 726, and, 730, against, the, veneration, of, images, the, religious, conflict, created, political, and, economic, divisions, in, byzantine, society, iconoclasm, was, generally, supported, by, the, eastern, poorer, non, greek, peoples, of, the, empire, who, had, to, frequently, deal, with, raids, from, the, new, muslim, empire, on, the, other, hand, the, wealthier, greeks, of, constantinople, and, the, peoples, of, the, balkan, and, italian, provinces, strongly, opposed, iconoclasm, peter, of, bruys, opposed, the, usage, of, religious, images, the, strigolniki, were, also, possibly, iconoclastic, claudius, of, turin, was, the, bishop, of, turin, from, 817, until, his, death, he, is, most, noted, for, teaching, iconoclasm, the, first, iconoclastic, wave, happened, in, wittenberg, in, the, early, 1520s, under, reformers, thomas, m, ntzer, and, andreas, karlstadt, in, the, absence, of, martin, luther, who, then, concealed, under, the, pen, name, of, junker, j, rg, intervened, to, calm, things, down, luther, argued, that, the, mental, picturing, of, christ, when, reading, the, scriptures, was, similar, in, character, to, artistic, renderings, of, christ, in, contrast, to, the, lutherans, who, favoured, certain, types, of, sacred, art, in, their, churches, and, homes, the, reformed, calvinist, leaders, in, particular, andreas, karlstadt, huldrych, zwingli, and, john, calvin, encouraged, the, removal, of, religious, images, by, invoking, the, decalogue, s, prohibition, of, idolatry, and, the, manufacture, of, graven, sculpted, images, of, god, as, a, result, individuals, attacked, statues, and, images, most, famously, in, the, beeldenstorm, across, the, low, countries, in, 1566, the, belief, of, iconoclasm, caused, havoc, throughout, europe, in, 1523, specifically, due, to, the, swiss, reformer, huldrych, zwingli, a, vast, number, of, his, followers, viewed, themselves, as, being, involved, in, a, spiritual, community, that, in, matters, of, faith, should, obey, neither, the, visible, church, nor, lay, authorities, according, to, peter, george, wallace, zwingli, s, attack, on, images, at, the, first, debate, triggered, iconoclastic, incidents, in, z, rich, and, the, villages, under, civic, jurisdiction, that, the, reformer, was, unwilling, to, condone, due, to, this, action, of, protest, against, authority, zwingli, responded, with, a, carefully, reasoned, treatise, that, men, could, not, live, in, society, without, laws, and, constraint, significant, iconoclastic, riots, took, place, in, basel, in, 1529, z, rich, 1523, copenhagen, 1530, m, nster, 1534, geneva, 1535, augsburg, 1537, scotland, 1559, rouen, 1560, and, saintes, and, la, rochelle, 1562, calvinist, iconoclasm, in, europe, provoked, reactive, riots, by, lutheran, mobs, in, germany, and, antagonized, the, neighbouring, eastern, orthodox, in, the, baltic, region, the, seventeen, provinces, now, the, netherlands, belgium, and, parts, of, northern, france, were, disrupted, by, widespread, calvinist, iconoclasm, in, the, summer, of, 1566, during, the, reformation, in, england, which, started, during, the, reign, of, anglican, monarch, henry, viii, and, was, urged, on, by, reformers, such, as, hugh, latimer, and, thomas, cranmer, limited, official, action, was, taken, against, religious, images, in, churches, in, the, late, 1530s, henry, s, young, son, edward, vi, came, to, the, throne, in, 1547, and, under, cranmer, s, guidance, issued, injunctions, for, religious, reforms, in, the, same, year, and, in, 1550, an, act, of, parliament, for, the, abolition, and, putting, away, of, divers, books, and, images, during, the, english, civil, war, the, parliamentarians, reorganised, the, administration, of, east, anglia, into, the, eastern, association, of, counties, this, covered, some, of, the, wealthiest, counties, in, england, which, in, turn, financed, a, substantial, and, significant, military, force, after, earl, of, manchester, was, appointed, the, commanding, officer, of, these, forces, in, turn, he, appointed, smasher, dowsing, as, provost, marshal, with, a, warrant, to, demolish, religious, images, which, were, considered, to, be, superstitious, or, linked, with, popism, bishop, joseph, hall, of, norwich, described, the, events, of, 1643, when, troops, and, citizens, encouraged, by, a, parliamentary, ordinance, against, superstition, and, idolatry, behaved, thus, lord, what, work, was, here, what, clattering, of, glasses, what, beating, down, of, walls, what, tearing, up, of, monuments, what, pulling, down, of, seats, what, wresting, out, of, irons, and, brass, from, the, windows, what, defacing, of, arms, what, demolishing, of, curious, stonework, what, tooting, and, piping, upon, organ, pipes, and, what, a, hideous, triumph, in, the, market, place, before, all, the, country, when, all, the, mangled, organ, pipes, vestments, both, copes, and, surplices, together, with, the, leaden, cross, which, had, newly, been, sawn, down, from, the, green, yard, pulpit, and, the, service, books, and, singing, books, that, could, be, carried, to, the, fire, in, the, public, market, place, were, heaped, together, protestant, christianity, was, not, uniformly, hostile, to, the, use, of, religious, images, martin, luther, taught, the, importance, of, images, as, tools, for, instruction, and, aids, to, devotion, stating, if, it, is, not, a, sin, but, good, to, have, the, image, of, christ, in, my, heart, why, should, it, be, a, sin, to, have, it, in, my, eyes, lutheran, churches, retained, ornate, church, interiors, with, a, prominent, crucifix, reflecting, their, high, view, of, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, eucharist, as, such, lutheran, worship, became, a, complex, ritual, choreography, set, in, a, richly, furnished, church, interior, for, lutherans, the, reformation, renewed, rather, than, removed, the, religious, image, lutheran, scholar, jeremiah, ohl, writes, 88, 89, zwingli, and, others, for, the, sake, of, saving, the, word, rejected, all, plastic, art, luther, with, an, equal, concern, for, the, word, but, far, more, conservative, would, have, all, the, arts, to, be, the, servants, of, the, gospel, i, am, not, of, the, opinion, said, that, through, the, gospel, all, the, arts, should, be, banished, and, driven, away, as, some, zealots, want, to, make, us, believe, but, i, wish, to, see, them, all, especially, music, in, the, service, of, him, who, gave, and, created, them, again, he, says, i, have, myself, heard, those, who, oppose, pictures, read, from, my, german, bible, but, this, contains, many, pictures, of, god, of, the, angels, of, men, and, of, animals, especially, in, the, revelation, of, st, john, in, the, books, of, moses, and, in, the, book, of, joshua, we, therefore, kindly, beg, these, fanatics, to, permit, us, also, to, paint, these, pictures, on, the, wall, that, they, may, be, remembered, and, better, understood, inasmuch, as, they, can, harm, as, little, on, the, walls, as, in, books, would, to, god, that, i, could, persuade, those, who, can, afford, it, to, paint, the, whole, bible, on, their, houses, inside, and, outside, so, that, all, might, see, this, would, indeed, be, a, christian, work, for, i, am, convinced, that, it, is, god, s, will, that, we, should, hear, and, learn, what, he, has, done, especially, what, christ, suffered, but, when, i, hear, these, things, and, meditate, upon, them, i, find, it, impossible, not, to, picture, them, in, my, heart, whether, i, want, to, or, not, when, i, hear, of, christ, a, human, form, hanging, upon, a, cross, rises, up, in, my, heart, just, as, i, see, my, natural, face, reflected, when, i, look, into, water, now, if, it, is, not, sinful, for, me, to, have, christ, s, picture, in, my, heart, why, should, it, be, sinful, to, have, it, before, my, eyes, the, ottoman, sultan, suleiman, the, magnificent, who, had, pragmatic, reasons, to, support, the, dutch, revolt, the, rebels, like, himself, were, fighting, against, spain, also, completely, approved, of, their, act, of, destroying, idols, which, accorded, well, with, muslim, teachings, a, bit, later, in, dutch, history, in, 1627, the, artist, johannes, van, der, beeck, was, arrested, and, tortured, charged, with, being, a, religious, non, conformist, and, a, blasphemer, heretic, atheist, and, satanist, the, 25, january, 1628, judgment, from, five, noted, advocates, of, the, hague, pronounced, him, guilty, of, blasphemy, against, god, and, avowed, atheism, at, the, same, time, as, leading, a, frightful, and, pernicious, lifestyle, at, the, court, s, order, his, paintings, were, burned, and, only, a, few, of, them, survive, in, japan, during, the, early, modern, age, the, spread, of, catholicism, also, involved, the, repulsion, of, non, christian, religious, structures, including, buddhist, temples, and, shinto, shrines, and, figures, at, times, of, conflict, with, rivals, or, some, time, after, the, conversion, of, several, daimyos, christian, converts, would, often, destroy, buddhist, and, shinto, religious, structures, many, of, the, moai, of, easter, island, were, toppled, during, the, 18th, century, in, the, iconoclasm, of, civil, wars, before, any, european, encounter, other, instances, of, iconoclasm, may, have, occurred, throughout, eastern, polynesia, during, its, conversion, to, christianity, in, the, 19th, century, after, the, second, vatican, council, in, the, late, 20th, century, some, roman, catholic, parish, churches, discarded, much, of, their, traditional, imagery, art, and, architecture, islam, has, a, strong, tradition, of, forbidding, the, depiction, of, figures, especially, religious, figures, with, sunni, islam, forbidding, it, more, than, shia, islam, in, the, history, of, islam, the, act, of, removing, idols, from, the, ka, ba, in, mecca, has, great, symbolic, and, historic, importance, for, all, believers, in, general, muslim, societies, have, avoided, the, depiction, of, living, beings, both, animals, and, humans, within, such, sacred, spaces, as, mosques, and, madrasahs, this, ban, on, figural, representation, is, not, based, on, the, qur, an, instead, it, is, based, on, traditions, which, are, described, within, the, hadith, the, prohibition, of, figuration, has, not, always, been, extended, to, the, secular, sphere, and, a, robust, tradition, of, figural, representation, exists, within, muslim, art, however, western, authors, have, tended, to, perceive, a, long, culturally, determined, and, unchanging, tradition, of, violent, iconoclastic, acts, within, islamic, society, the, first, act, of, muslim, iconoclasm, dates, to, the, beginning, of, islam, in, 630, when, the, various, statues, of, arabian, deities, housed, in, the, kaaba, in, mecca, were, destroyed, there, is, a, tradition, that, muhammad, spared, a, fresco, of, mary, and, jesus, this, act, was, intended, to, bring, an, end, to, the, idolatry, which, in, the, muslim, view, characterized, jahiliyyah, the, destruction, of, the, idols, of, mecca, did, not, however, determine, the, treatment, of, other, religious, communities, living, under, muslim, rule, after, the, expansion, of, the, caliphate, most, christians, under, muslim, rule, for, example, continued, to, produce, icons, and, to, decorate, their, churches, as, they, wished, a, major, exception, to, this, pattern, of, tolerance, in, early, islamic, history, was, the, edict, of, yaz, d, issued, by, the, umayyad, caliph, yaz, d, ii, in, 722, 723, this, edict, ordered, the, destruction, of, crosses, and, christian, images, within, the, territory, of, the, caliphate, researchers, have, discovered, evidence, that, the, order, was, followed, particularly, in, present, day, jordan, where, archaeological, evidence, shows, the, removal, of, images, from, the, mosaic, floors, of, some, although, not, all, of, the, churches, that, stood, at, this, time, but, yaz, d, s, iconoclastic, policies, were, not, continued, by, his, successors, and, christian, communities, of, the, levant, continued, to, make, icons, without, significant, interruption, from, the, sixth, century, to, the, ninth, al, maqr, z, writing, in, the, 15th, century, attributes, the, missing, nose, on, the, great, sphinx, of, giza, to, iconoclasm, by, muhammad, sa, im, al, dahr, a, sufi, muslim, in, the, mid, 1300s, he, was, reportedly, outraged, by, local, muslims, making, offerings, to, the, great, sphinx, in, the, hope, of, controlling, the, flood, cycle, and, he, was, later, executed, for, vandalism, however, whether, this, was, actually, the, cause, of, the, missing, nose, has, been, debated, by, historians, mark, lehner, having, performed, an, archaeological, study, concluded, that, it, was, broken, with, instruments, at, an, earlier, unknown, time, between, the, 3rd, and, 10th, centuries, certain, conquering, muslim, armies, have, used, local, temples, or, houses, of, worship, as, mosques, an, example, is, hagia, sophia, in, istanbul, formerly, constantinople, which, was, converted, into, a, mosque, in, 1453, most, icons, were, desecrated, and, the, rest, were, covered, with, plaster, in, 1934, the, government, of, turkey, decided, to, convert, the, hagia, sophia, into, a, museum, and, the, restoration, of, the, mosaics, was, undertaken, by, the, american, byzantine, institute, beginning, in, 1932, certain, muslim, denominations, continue, to, pursue, iconoclastic, agendas, there, has, been, much, controversy, within, islam, over, the, recent, and, apparently, on, going, destruction, of, historic, sites, by, saudi, arabian, authorities, prompted, by, the, fear, they, could, become, the, subject, of, idolatry, a, recent, act, of, iconoclasm, was, the, 2001, destruction, of, the, giant, buddhas, of, bamyan, by, the, then, taliban, government, of, afghanistan, the, act, generated, worldwide, protests, and, was, not, supported, by, other, muslim, governments, and, organizations, it, was, widely, perceived, in, the, western, media, as, a, result, of, the, muslim, prohibition, against, figural, decoration, such, an, account, overlooks, the, coexistence, between, the, buddhas, and, the, muslim, population, that, marveled, at, them, for, over, a, millennium, before, their, destruction, according, to, art, historian, f, b, flood, analysis, of, the, taliban, s, statements, regarding, the, buddhas, suggest, that, their, destruction, was, motivated, more, by, political, than, by, theological, concerns, taliban, spokesmen, have, given, many, different, explanations, of, the, motives, for, the, destruction, during, the, tuareg, rebellion, of, 2012, the, radical, islamist, militia, ansar, dine, destroyed, various, sufi, shrines, from, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, in, the, city, of, timbuktu, mali, in, 2016, the, international, criminal, court, icc, sentenced, ahmad, al, faqi, al, mahdi, a, former, member, of, ansar, dine, to, nine, years, in, prison, for, this, destruction, of, cultural, world, heritage, this, was, the, first, time, that, the, icc, convicted, a, person, for, such, a, crime, the, islamic, state, of, iraq, and, the, levant, carried, out, iconoclastic, attacks, such, as, the, destruction, of, shia, mosques, and, shrines, notable, incidents, include, blowing, up, the, mosque, of, the, prophet, yunus, jonah, and, destroying, the, shrine, to, seth, in, mosul, in, early, medieval, india, there, were, numerous, recorded, instances, of, temple, desecration, mostly, by, indian, muslim, kings, against, rival, indian, hindu, kingdoms, which, involved, conflicts, between, hindus, buddhists, and, jains, in, the, 8th, century, bengali, troops, from, the, buddhist, pala, empire, looted, temples, of, vishnu, the, state, deity, of, lalitaditya, s, kingdom, in, kashmir, in, the, early, 9th, century, indian, hindu, kings, from, kanchipuram, and, the, pandyan, king, srimara, srivallabha, looted, buddhist, temples, in, sri, lanka, in, the, early, 10th, century, the, pratihara, king, herambapala, looted, an, image, from, a, temple, in, the, sahi, kingdom, of, kangra, which, was, later, looted, by, the, pratihara, king, yashovarman, records, from, the, campaign, recorded, in, the, chach, nama, record, the, destruction, of, temples, during, the, early, 8th, century, when, the, umayyad, governor, of, damascus, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, mobilized, an, expedition, of, 6000, cavalry, under, muhammad, bin, qasim, in, 712, historian, upendra, thakur, records, the, persecution, of, hindus, and, buddhists, muhammad, triumphantly, marched, into, the, country, conquering, debal, sehwan, nerun, brahmanadabad, alor, and, multan, one, after, the, other, in, quick, succession, and, in, less, than, a, year, and, a, half, the, far, flung, hindu, kingdom, was, crushed, there, was, a, fearful, outbreak, of, religious, bigotry, in, several, places, and, temples, were, wantonly, desecrated, at, debal, the, nairun, and, aror, temples, were, demolished, and, converted, into, mosques, perhaps, the, most, notorious, episode, of, iconoclasm, in, india, was, mahmud, of, ghazni, s, attack, on, the, somnath, temple, from, across, the, thar, desert, the, temple, was, first, raided, in, 725, when, junayad, the, governor, of, sind, sent, his, armies, to, destroy, it, in, 1024, during, the, reign, of, bhima, i, the, prominent, turkic, muslim, ruler, mahmud, of, ghazni, raided, gujarat, plundering, the, somnath, temple, and, breaking, its, jyotirlinga, despite, pleas, by, brahmins, not, to, break, it, he, took, away, a, booty, of, 20, million, dinars, 39, the, attack, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, belief, that, an, idol, of, the, goddess, manat, had, been, secretly, transferred, to, the, temple, according, to, the, ghaznavid, court, poet, farrukhi, sistani, who, claimed, to, have, accompanied, mahmud, on, his, raid, somnat, as, rendered, in, persian, was, a, garbled, version, of, su, manat, referring, to, the, goddess, manat, according, to, him, as, well, as, a, later, ghaznavid, historian, abu, sa, id, gardezi, the, images, of, the, other, goddesses, were, destroyed, in, arabia, but, the, one, of, manat, was, secretly, sent, away, to, kathiawar, in, modern, gujarat, for, safekeeping, since, the, idol, of, manat, was, an, aniconic, image, of, black, stone, it, could, have, been, easily, confused, with, a, lingam, at, somnath, mahmud, is, said, to, have, broken, the, idol, and, taken, away, parts, of, it, as, loot, and, placed,
