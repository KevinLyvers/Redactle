such, demons, are, not, the, greek, intermediary, spirits, but, hostile, entities, already, known, in, iranian, beliefs, in, western, esotericism, and, renaissance, magic, which, grew, out, of, an, amalgamation, of, greco, roman, magic, jewish, aggadah, and, christian, demonology, a, demon, is, believed, to, be, a, spiritual, entity, that, may, be, conjured, and, controlled, belief, in, demons, remains, an, important, part, of, many, modern, religions, and, occult, traditions, demons, are, still, feared, largely, due, to, their, alleged, power, to, possess, living, creatures, in, contemporary, western, esoteric, traditions, demons, may, be, used, as, metaphors, for, inner, psychological, processes, inner, demons, the, ancient, greek, word, daim, n, denotes, a, spirit, or, divine, power, much, like, the, latin, genius, or, numen, daim, n, most, likely, came, from, the, greek, verb, daiesthai, to, divide, or, distribute, the, greek, conception, of, a, daim, n, notably, appears, in, the, philosophical, works, of, plato, where, it, describes, the, divine, inspiration, of, socrates, the, original, greek, word, daim, n, does, not, carry, the, negative, connotation, initially, understood, by, implementation, of, the, koine, daimonion, and, later, ascribed, to, any, cognate, words, sharing, the, root, the, greek, terms, do, not, have, any, connotations, of, evil, or, malevolence, in, fact, eudaimonia, which, literally, translates, as, good, spiritedness, means, happiness, by, the, early, centuries, of, the, roman, empire, cult, statues, were, seen, by, pagans, and, their, christian, neighbors, alike, as, inhabited, by, the, numinous, presence, of, the, greco, roman, gods, like, pagans, christians, still, sensed, and, saw, the, gods, and, their, power, and, as, something, they, had, to, assume, lay, behind, it, by, an, easy, traditional, shift, of, opinion, they, turned, these, pagan, daimones, into, malevolent, demons, the, troupe, of, satan, far, into, the, byzantine, period, christians, eyed, their, cities, old, pagan, statuary, as, a, seat, of, the, demons, presence, it, was, no, longer, beautiful, it, was, infested, the, term, had, first, acquired, its, negative, connotations, in, the, septuagint, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, into, greek, which, drew, on, the, mythology, of, ancient, semitic, religions, this, was, then, inherited, by, the, koine, text, of, the, new, testament, the, english, use, of, demon, as, synonym, for, devils, goes, back, at, least, as, far, as, about, 825, the, german, word, d, mon, however, is, different, from, devil, teufel, and, demons, as, evil, spirits, and, akin, to, the, original, meaning, of, daimon, the, western, modern, era, conception, of, a, demon, as, in, the, ars, goetia, derives, seamlessly, from, the, ambient, popular, culture, of, late, antiquity, aboriginal, australian, cultures, have, various, beings, translated, into, english, as, demons, or, devils, the, most, notable, is, the, bunyip, which, was, originally, a, term, applied, to, malevolent, spirits, in, general, tasmanian, mythology, in, particular, has, many, beings, translated, as, devils, these, include, malicious, spirits, like, rageowrapper, as, well, as, spirits, summoned, in, magic, tasmanian, aboriginal, people, would, describe, these, entities, as, devils, and, related, that, these, spiritual, beings, as, walking, alongside, aboriginal, people, carrying, a, torch, but, could, not, be, seen, the, exact, definition, of, demon, in, egyptology, posed, a, major, problem, for, modern, scholarship, since, the, borders, between, a, deity, and, a, demon, are, sometimes, blurred, and, the, ancient, egyptian, language, lacks, a, term, for, the, modern, english, demon, both, deities, and, demons, can, act, as, intermediaries, to, deliver, messages, to, humans, by, that, they, share, some, resemblance, to, the, greek, daimon, however, magical, writings, indicate, that, ancient, egyptians, acknowledged, the, existence, of, malevolent, demons, by, highlighting, the, demon, names, with, red, ink, demons, in, this, culture, appeared, to, be, subordinative, and, related, to, a, specific, deity, yet, they, may, have, occasionally, acted, independently, of, the, divine, will, the, existence, of, demons, can, be, related, to, the, realm, of, chaos, beyond, the, created, world, but, even, this, negative, connotation, cannot, be, denied, in, light, of, the, magical, texts, the, role, of, demons, in, relation, to, the, human, world, remains, ambivalent, and, largely, depends, on, context, ancient, egyptian, demons, can, be, divided, into, two, classes, guardians, and, wanderers, guardians, are, tied, to, a, specific, place, their, demonic, activity, is, topographically, defined, and, their, function, can, be, benevolent, towards, those, who, have, the, secret, knowledge, to, face, them, demons, protecting, the, underworld, may, prevent, human, souls, from, entering, paradise, only, by, knowing, the, right, charms, is, the, deceased, able, to, enter, the, halls, of, osiris, here, the, aggressive, nature, of, the, guardian, demons, is, motivated, by, the, need, to, protect, their, abodes, and, not, by, their, evil, essence, accordingly, demons, guarded, sacred, places, or, the, gates, to, the, netherworld, during, the, ptolemaic, and, roman, period, the, guardians, shifted, towards, the, role, of, genius, loci, and, they, were, the, focus, of, local, and, private, cults, the, wanderers, are, associated, with, possession, mental, illness, death, and, plagues, many, of, them, serve, as, executioners, for, the, major, deities, such, as, ra, or, osiris, when, ordered, to, punish, humans, on, earth, or, in, the, netherworld, wanderers, can, also, be, agents, of, chaos, arising, from, the, world, beyond, creation, to, bring, about, misfortune, and, suffering, without, any, divine, instructions, led, only, by, evil, motivations, the, influences, of, the, wanderers, can, be, warded, off, and, kept, at, the, borders, of, the, human, world, by, the, use, of, magic, but, they, can, never, be, destroyed, a, sub, category, of, wanderers, are,

traditionally, been, identified, as, a, demoness, the, fact, that, she, could, cause, evil, on, her, own, without, the, permission, of, other, deities, strongly, indicates, that, she, was, seen, as, a, goddess, in, her, own, right, mesopotamian, peoples, protected, against, her, using, amulets, and, talismans, she, was, believed, to, ride, in, her, boat, on, the, river, of, the, underworld, and,

the, colossal, bulls, used, as, protective, jinn, of, royal, palaces, there, are, differing, opinions, in, judaism, about, the, existence, or, non, existence, of, demons, shedim, or, se, irim, some, rabbinic, scholars, assert, that, demons, have, existed, in, talmudic, times, but, do, not, exist, regularly, in, present, when, prophecy, divine, presence, and, divine, inspiration, gradually, decreased, the, demonic, powers, of, impurity, have, become, correspondingly, weak, too, the, hebrew, bible, mentions, two, classes, of, demonic, spirits, the, se, irim, and, the, shedim, the, word, shedim, sing, shed, or, sheyd, appears, in, two, places, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, se, irim, sing, sa, ir, male, goat, are, mentioned, once, in, leviticus, 17, 7, probably, a, recollection, of, assyrian, demons, in, the, shape, of, goats, they, might, be, a, metaphorical, symbol, for, life, threatening, animals, such, as, hyenas, ostrichs, and, jackals, the, shedim, however, are, not, pagan, demigods, but, the, foreign, gods, themselves, both, entities, appear, in, a, scriptural, context, of, animal, or, child, sacrifice, to, non, existent, false, gods, various, diseases, and, ailments, were, ascribed, to, demons, particularly, those, affecting, the, brain, and, those, of, internal, nature, examples, include, catalepsy, headache, epilepsy, and, nightmares, there, also, existed, a,

disease, while, overwhelming, or, seizing, the, victim, to, cure, such, diseases, it, was, necessary, to, draw, out, the, evil, demons, by, certain, incantations, and, talismanic, performances, at, which, the, essenes, excelled, josephus, who, spoke, of, demons, as, spirits, of, the, wicked, which, enter, into, men, that, are, alive, and, kill, them, but, which, could, be, driven, out, by, a, certain, root, witnessed, such, a, performance, in, the, presence, of, the, emperor, vespasian, and, ascribed, its, origin, to, king, solomon, in, mythology, there, were, few, defences, against, babylonian, demons, the, mythical, mace, sharur, had, the, power, to, slay, demons, such, as, asag, a, legendary, gallu, or, edimmu, of, hideous, strength, in, the, jerusalem, talmud, notions, of, shedim, demons, or, spirits, are, almost, unknown, or, occur, only, very, rarely, whereas, in, the, babylonian, talmud, there, are, many, references, to, shedim, and, magical, incantations, the, existence, of, shedim, in, general, was, not, questioned, by, most, of, the, babylonian, talmudists, as, a, consequence, of, the, rise, of, influence, of, the, babylonian, talmud, over, that, of, the, jerusalem, talmud, late, rabbis, in, general, took, as, fact, the, existence, of, shedim, nor, did, most, of, the, medieval, thinkers, question, their, reality, however, rationalists, like, maimonides, and, saadia, gaon, and, others, explicitly, denied, their, existence, and, completely, rejected, concepts, of, demons, evil, spirits, negative, spiritual, influences, attaching, and, possessing, spirits, they, thought, the, essential, teaching, about, shedim, and, similar, spirits, is, that, they, should, not, be, an, object, of, worship, not, a, reality, to, be, acknowledged, or, feared, their, point, of, view, eventually, became, mainstream, jewish, understanding, the, opinion, of, some, authors, is, not, clear, abraham, ibn, ezra, states, that, insane, people, can, see, the, image, of, se, irim, when, they, go, astray, and, ascribe, to, them, powers, independent, from, god, it, is, not, clear, from, his, work, if, he, considered, these, images, of, se, irim, as, manifestations, of, actual, spirits, or, merely, delusions, despite, academic, consensus, rabbis, disputed, that, maimonides, denied, the, existence, of, demons, entirely, he, would, only, dispute, the, existence, of, demons, in, his, own, life, time, but, not, that, demons, had, existed, once, occasionally, an, angel, is, called, satan, in, the, babylon, talmud, but, satans, do, not, refer, to, demons, as, they, remain, at, the, service, of, god, stand, not, in, the, way, of, an, ox, when, coming, from, the, pasture, for, satan, dances, between, his, horns, aggadic, tales, from, the, persian, tradition, describe, the, shedim, the, mazzi, im, harmers, and, the, ru, in, spirits, there, were, also, lilin, night, spirits, elane, shade, or, evening, spirits, iharire, midday, spirits, and, afrire, morning, spirits, as, well, as, the, demons, that, bring, famine, and, such, as, cause, storm, and, earthquake, according, to, some, aggadic, stories, demons, were, under, the, dominion, of, a, king, or, chief, usually, asmodai, in, kabbalah, demons, are, regarded, as, a, necessary, part, of, the, divine, emanation, in, the, material, world, and, a, byproduct, of, human, sin, qlippoth, after, they, are, created, they, assume, an, existence, on, their, own, demons, would, attach, themselves, to, the, sinner, and, start, to, multiply, as, an, act, of, self, preservation, medieval, kabbalists, characterize, such, demons, as, punishing, angels, of, destruction, they, are, subject, to, the, divine, will, and, do, not, act, independently, other, demonic, entities, such, as, the, shedim, might, be, considered, benevolent, the, zohar, classifies, them, as, those, who, are, like, humans, and, submit, to, the, torah, and, those, who, have, no, fear, of, god, and, are, like, animals, the, sources, of, demonic, influence, were, thought, to, originate, from, the, watchers, or, nephilim, who, are, first, mentioned, in, genesis, 6, and, are, the, focus, of, 1, enoch, chapters, 1, 16, and, also, in, jubilees, 10, the, nephilim, were, seen, as, the, source, of, the, sin, and, evil, on, earth, because, they, are, referenced, in, genesis, 6, 4, before, the, story, of, the, flood, in, genesis, 6, 5, god, sees, evil, in, the, hearts, of, men, ethiopic, enoch, refers, to, genesis, 6, 4, 5, and, provides, further, description, of, the, story, connecting, the, nephilim, to, the, corruption, of, humans, according, to, the, book, of, enoch, sin, originates, when, angels, descend, from, heaven, and, fornicate, with, women, birthing, giants, the, book, of, enoch, shows, that, these, fallen, angels, can, lead, humans, to, sin, through, direct, interaction, or, through, providing, forbidden, knowledge, most, scholars, understand, the, text, that, demons, originate, from, the, evil, spirits, of, the, deceased, giants, cursed, by, god, to, wander, the, earth, dale, martin, disagrees, with, this, interpretation, arguing, that, the, ghosts, of, the, nephilim, are, distinct, the, evil, spirits, would, make, the, people, sacrifice, to, the, demons, but, they, were, not, demons, themselves, the, spirits, are, stated, in, enoch, to, corrupt, fall, be, excited, and, fall, upon, the, earth, and, cause, sorrow, the, book, of, jubilees, conveys, that, sin, occurs, when, cainan, accidentally, transcribes, astrological, knowledge, used, by, the, watchers, this, differs, from, enoch, in, that, it, does, not, place, blame, on, the, angels, however, in, jubilees, 10, 4, the, evil, spirits, of, the, watchers, are, discussed, as, evil, and, still, remain, on, earth, to, corrupt, humans, god, binds, only, 90, of, the, watchers, and, destroys, them, leaving, 10, to, be, ruled, by, mastema, because, the, evil, in, humans, is, great, only, 10, would, be, needed, to, corrupt, and, lead, humans, astray, these, spirits, of, the, giants, are, also, referred, to, as, the, bastards, in, the, apotropaic, prayer, songs, of, the, sage, which, lists, the,

deceitful, however, nothing, is, purely, evil, or, good, and, a, demon, could, eventually, abandon, his, demonic, nature, belief, in, demons, does, not, constitute, an, essential, feature, in, buddhism, however, since, belief, in, demons, were, common, during, the, rise, of, buddhism, they, are, integrated, into, the, cycle, of, sa, s, ra, accordingly, their, malevolent, condition, is, due, to, their, bad, karma, from, their, previous, lives, when, buddhism, spread, it, accommodated, itself, with, indigenous, popular, ideas, about, demons, the, zorastrian, belief, in, demons, daeva,

demons, as, the, opposite, of, the, creative, power, of, god, as, such, they, cannot, create, but, only, corrupt, and, thus, evil, is, merely, the, corruption, of, the, good, since, demons, can, only, destroy, they, will, ultimately, destroy, themselves, chapter, 30, questions, the, reality, of, demons, since, their, existence, seem, to, rely, on, their, destruction, of, good, therefore, ahriman,

a, past, moment, in, which, two, principles, good, and, evil, were, separate, a, contemporary, moment, in, which, both, principles, are, mixed, due, to, an, assault, of, the, world, of, darkness, on, the, realm, of, light, and, a, future, moment, when, both, principles, are, distinct, forever, thus, evil, and, demons, played, a, significant, role, within, manichaean, teachings, there, are,

general, negative, association, remains, during, the, islamic, period, common, features, of, these, middle, eastern, demons, are, their, immortality, and, pernicious, nature, they, can, turn, invisible, and, can, be, enslaved, when, pierced, by, a, silver, needle, due, to, their, reluctant, nature, even, enslaved, they, do, always, the, opposite, of, what, has, been, commanded, like, the,

basmalah, invocation, of, the, name, of, allah, is, used, to, ward, off, demons, while, among, armenians, the, symbol, of, the, cross, is, utilized, the, origin, of, the, demons, is, explained, by, abu, ali, bal, ami, s, interpretation, of, tarikh, al, tabari, as, the, possibly, first, creation, of, god, allah, the, demons, would, have, reigned, for, 70, 000, years, until, they, have, been, replaced, by, the, jinn, peri, only, then, 5000, years, later, the, angels, firis, h, ta, were, sent, with, iblis, as, their, leader, to, chase, them, away, and, the, story, of, adam, begins, p40, according, to, the, s, leymanname, written, during, the, time, of, suleiman, the, magnificent, demons, were, created, in, the, time, between, the, par, and, the, angels, from, the, fires, of, the, stars, and, smoke, due, to, the, islamic, belief, system, prevailing, in, middle, eastern, and, central, asian, culture, at, the, time, authors, emphasized, that, demons, only, exist, by, god, s, will, and, not, as, an, independent, or, even, accidental, part, of, the, world, muslim, authors, sometimes, identified, the, demons, with, the, devils, and, ifrits, of, islamic, tradition, as, the, quran, asserts, that, it, is, god, who, controls, both, the, angels, and, devils, p452, the, existence, of, demons, as, inherently, malicious, spirits, within, old, testamental, texts, is, absent, 447, though, there, are, evil, spirits, sent, by, yhwh, they, can, hardly, be, called, demons, since, they, serve, and, do, not, oppose, the, governing, deity, 448, first, then, the, hebrew, bible, was, translated, into, greek, the, gods, of, other, nations, were, merged, into, a, single, category, of, demons, daimones, with, implied, negativity, the, greek, daimons, were, associated, with, demi, divine, entities, deities, illnesses, and, fortune, telling, the, jewish, translators, rendered, them, all, as, demons, depicting, their, power, as, nullified, comparable, to, the, description, of, shedim, in, the, tanakh, although, all, these, supernatural, powers, were, translated, none, were, angels, despite, sharing, a, similar, function, to, that, of, the, greek, daimon, this, established, a, dualism, between, the, angels, on, god, s, side, and, negatively, evaluated, demons, of, pagan, origin, their, relationship, to, the, god, head, became, the, main, difference, between, angels, and, demons, not, their, degree, of, benevolence, both, angels, and, demons, might, be, fierce, and, terrifying, however, the, angels, act, always, at, service, of, the, high, god, of, the, israelites, differing, from, the, pagan, demons, who, represent, the, powers, of, foreign, deities, the, septuagint, refers, to, evil, spirits, as, demons, daimon, through, the, new, testament, demons, appear, 55, times, and, 46, times, in, reference, to, demonic, possession, or, exorcisms, some, old, english, bible, translations, such, as, king, james, version, do, not, have, the, word, demon, in, their, vocabulary, and, translate, it, as, devil, as, adversaries, of, jesus, demons, are, not, morally, ambivalent, spirits, but, evil, causes, of, misery, suffering, and, death, they, are, not, tempters, but, the, cause, of, pain, suffering, and, maladies, both, physical, and, mental, temptation, is, reserved, for, the, devil, only, unlike, spirits, in, pagan, beliefs, demons, are, not, intermediary, spirits, who, must, be, sacrificed, for, the, appeasement, of, a, deity, possession, also, shows, no, trace, of, positivity, contrary, to, some, pagan, depictions, of, spirit, possession, they, are, explicitly, said, to, be, ruled, by, the, devil, or, beelzebub, their, origin, is, unclear, the, texts, take, the, existence, of, demons, for, granted, many, early, christians, like, irenaeus, justin, martyr, clement, of, alexandria, and, lactantius, assumed, demons, were, ghosts, of, the, nephilim, known, from, intertestamental, writings, because, of, references, to, satan, as, the, lord, of, demons, and, evil, angels, of, satan, throughout, the, new, testament, other, scholars, identified, fallen, angels, with, demons, demons, as, entirely, evil, entities, who, have, been, born, evil, may, not, fit, the, proposed, origin, of, evil, in, free, will, taught, in, alternate, or, opposing, theologies, demons, are, included, in, biblical, interpretation, in, the, story, of, passover, the, bible, tells, the, story, as, the, lord, struck, down, all, the, firstborn, in, egypt, exodus, 12, 21, 29, in, the, book, of, jubilees, which, is, considered, canonical, only, by, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, this, same, event, is, told, slightly, differently, all, the, powers, of, mastema, had, been, let, loose, to, slay, all, the, first, born, in, the, land, of, egypt, and, the, powers, of, the, lord, did, everything, according, as, the, lord, commanded, them, jubilees, 49, 2, 4, in, the, genesis, flood, narrative, the, author, explains, how, god, was, noticing, how, corrupt, the, earth, had, become, for, all, the, people, on, earth, had, corrupted, their, ways, genesis, 6, 12, in, jubilees, the, sins, of, man, are, attributed, to, the, unclean, demons, began, to, lead, astray, the, children, of, the, sons, of, noah, and, to, make, to, err, and, destroy, them, jubilees, 10, 1, in, jubilees, mastema, questions, the, loyalty, of, abraham, and, tells, god, to, bid, him, offer, him, as, a, burnt, offering, on, the, altar, and, thou, wilt, see, if, he, will, do, this, command, jubilees, 17, 16, the, discrepancy, between, the, story, in, jubilees, and, the, story, in, genesis, 22, exists, with, the, presence, of, mastema, in, genesis, god, tests, the, will, of, abraham, merely, to, determine, whether, he, is, a, true, follower, however, in, jubilees, mastema, has, an, agenda, behind, promoting, the, sacrifice, of, abraham, s, son, an, even, more, demonic, act, than, that, of, satan, in, job, in, jubilees, where, mastema, an, angel, tasked, with, tempting, mortals, into, sin, and, iniquity, requests, that, god, give, him, a, tenth, of, the, spirits, of, the, children, of, the, watchers, demons, in, order, to, aid, the, process, jubilees, 10, 7, 9, these, demons, are, passed, into, mastema, s, authority, where, once, again, an, angel, is, in, charge, of, demonic, spirits, in, the, testament, of, solomon, written, sometime, in, the, first, three, centuries, c, e, the, demon, asmodeus, explains, that, he, is, the, son, of, an, angel, and, a, human, mother, another, demon, describes, himself, as, having, died, in, the, massacre, in, the, age, of, giants, beelzeboul, the, prince, of, demons, appears, as, a, fallen, angel, not, as, a, demon, but, makes, people, worship, demons, as, their, gods, since, early, christianity, demonology, has, developed, from, a, simple, acceptance, of, demons, to, a, complex, study, that, has, grown, from, the, original, ideas, taken, from, jewish, demonology, and, christian, scriptures, christian, demonology, is, studied, in, depth, within, the, roman, catholic, church, although, many, other, christian, churches, affirm, and, discuss, the, existence, of, demons, building, upon, the, few, references, to, daimon, in, the, new, testament, especially, the, poetry, of, the, book, of, revelation, christian, writers, of, apocrypha, from, the, second, century, onwards, created, a, more, complicated, tapestry, of, beliefs, about, demons, that, was, largely, independent, of, christian, scripture, while, daimons, were, considered, as, both, potentially, benevolent, or, malevolent, origen, argued, against, celsus, that, daimons, are, exclusively, evil, entities, supporting, the, later, idea, of, evil, demons, according, to, origen, s, cosmology, increasing, corruption, and, evil, within, the, soul, the, more, estranged, the, soul, gets, from, god, therefore, origen, opined, that, the, most, evil, demons, are, located, underground, besides, the, fallen, angels, known, from, christian, scriptures, origen, talks, about, greek, daemons, like, nature, spirits, and, giants, these, creatures, were, thought, to, inhabit, nature, or, air, and, nourish, from, pagan, sacrifices, roaming, the, earth, however, there, is, no, functional, difference, between, the, spirits, of, the, underworld, and, of, earth, since, both, have, fallen, from, perfection, into, the, material, world, origen, sums, them, up, as, fallen, angels, and, thus, equal, to, demons, many, ascetics, like, origen, and, anthony, the, great, described, demons, as, psychological, powers, tempting, to, evil, in, contrast, to, benevolent, angels, advising, good, according, to, life, of, anthony, written, in, greek, around, 360, by, athanasius, of, alexandria, most, of, the, time, the, demons, were, expressed, as, an, internal, struggle, inclinations, and, temptations, but, after, anthony, successfully, resisted, the, demons, they, would, appear, in, human, form, to, tempt, and, threaten, him, even, more, intensely, pseudo, dionysius, the, areopagite, described, evil, as, defiancy, and, does, not, give, evil, an, ontological, existence, he, explains, demons, are, deficient, creatures, who, willingly, turn, themselves, towards, the, unreal, and, non, existence, their, dangerous, nature, results, not, from, the, power, of, their, nature, but, from, their, tendency, to, drag, others, into, the, void, and, the, unreal, away, from, god, michael, psellos, proposed, the, existence, of, several, types, of, demons, deeply, influenced, by, the, material, nature, of, the, regions, they, dwell, the, highest, and, most, powerful, demons, attack, the, mind, of, people, using, their, imaginative, action, phantastikos, to, produce, illusions, in, the, mind, the, lowest, demons, on, the, other, hand, are, almost, mindless, gross, and, grunting, spirits, which, try, to, possess, people, instinctively, simply, attracted, by, the, warmth, and, life, of, humans, these, cause, diseases, fatal, accidents, and, animalistic, behavior, in, their, victims, they, are, unable, to, speak, while, other, lower, types, of, demons, might, give, out, false, oracles, the, demons, are, divided, into, invocation, of, saints, holy, men, and, women, especially, ascetics, reading, the, gospel, holy, oil, or, water, is, said, to, drive, them, out, however, psellos, schemes, have, been, too, inconsistent, to, answer, questions, about, the, hierarchy, of, fallen, angels, the, devil, s, position, is, impossible, to, assign, in, this, scheme, and, it, does, not, respond, to, living, perceptions, of, felt, experience, and, was, considered, rather, impractical, to, have, a, lasting, effect, or, impact, on, christian, demonology, the, contemporary, roman, catholic, church, unequivocally, teaches, that, angels, and, demons, are, real, beings, rather, than, just, symbolic, devices, the, catholic, church, has, a, cadre, of, officially, sanctioned, exorcists, which, perform, many, exorcisms, each, year, the, exorcists, of, the, catholic, church, teach, that, demons, attack, humans, continually, but, that, afflicted, persons, can, be, effectively, healed, and, protected, either, by, the, formal, rite, of, exorcism, authorized, to, be, performed, only, by, bishops, and, those, they, designate, or, by, prayers, of, deliverance, which, any, christian, can, offer, for, themselves, or, others, at, various, times, in, christian, history, attempts, have, been, made, to, classify, demons, according, to, various, proposed, demonic, hierarchies, in, recent, times, scholars, doubted, that, independent, demons, exist, and, rather, considers, them, aking, to, jewish, satan, to, be, servants, of, god, according, to, s, n, chiu, god, is, shown, sending, a, demon, against, saul, in, 1, samuel, 16, and, 18, in, order, to, punish, him, for, the, failure, to, follow, god, s, instructions, showing, god, as, having, the, power, to, use, demons, for, his, own, purposes, putting, the, demon, under, his, divine, authority, according, to, the, britannica, concise, encyclopedia, demons, despite, being, typically, associated, with, evil, are, often, shown, to, be, under, divine, control, and, not, acting, of, their, own, devices, in, mandaeism, the, world, of, darkness, alma, d, h, uka, also, referred, to, as, sheol, is, the, underworld, located, below,

largely, relies, on, greek, and, persian, dualism, especially, on, platonism, in, accordance, with, platonism, they, regarded, the, idea, as, good, while, considering, the, material, and, conscious, world, to, be, inherently, evil, the, demonized, star, deities, of, late, persian, religion, became, associated, with, a, demon, thus, identifying, the, seven, observable, planets, with, an, archon, demonic, ruler, these, demons, rule, over, the, earth, and, the, realm, of, planets, representing, different, desires, and, passions, according, to, origen, the, ophites, depicted, the, world, as, surrounded, by, the, demonic, leviathan, like, in, christianity, the, term, daimons, was, used, for, demons, and, refers, to, both, the, archons, as, well, as, to, their, demonic, assistants, judas,
