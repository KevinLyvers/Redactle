epicurean, philosophy, that, flourished, in, and, beyond, the, post, hellenic, world, it, is, a, repeated, view, among, scholars, that, the, humanistic, features, of, ancient, greek, thought, are, the, roots, of, humanism, 2, 000, years, later, other, predecessor, movements, that, sometimes, use, the, same, or, equivalent, vocabulary, to, modern, western, humanism, can, be, found, in, chinese,

were, verona, naples, and, avignon, petrarch, who, is, often, referred, to, as, the, father, of, humanism, is, a, significant, figure, petrarch, was, raised, in, avignon, he, was, inclined, toward, education, at, a, very, early, age, and, studied, alongside, his, well, educated, father, petrarch, s, enthusiasm, for, ancient, texts, led, him, to, discover, manuscripts, such, as, cicero, s, pro, archia, and, pomponius, mela, s, de, chorographia, that, were, influential, in, the, development, of, the, renaissance, petrarch, wrote, latin, poems, such, as, canzoniere, and, de, viris, illustribus, in, which, he, described, humanist, ideas, his, most, significant, contribution, was, a, list, of, books, outlining, the, four, major, disciplines, rhetoric, moral, philosophy, poetry, and, grammar, that, became, the, basis, of, humanistic, studies, studia, humanitatis, petrarch, s, list, relied, heavily, on, ancient, writers, especially, cicero, the, revival, of, classicist, authors, continued, after, petrarch, s, death, florence, chancellor, and, humanist, coluccio, salutati, made, his, city, a, prominent, center, of, renaissance, humanism, his, circle, included, other, notable, humanists, including, leonardo, bruni, who, rediscovered, translated, and, popularized, ancient, texts, humanists, heavily, influenced, education, vittorino, da, feltre, and, guarino, veronese, created, schools, based, on, humanistic, principles, their, curriculum, was, widely, adopted, and, by, the, 16th, century, humanistic, paideia, was, the, dominant, outlook, of, pre, university, education, parallel, with, advances, in, education, renaissance, humanists, made, progress, in, fields, such, as, philosophy, mathematics, and, religion, in, philosophy, angelo, poliziano, nicholas, of, cusa, and, marsilio, ficino, further, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, ancient, classical, philosophers, and, giovanni, pico, della, mirandola, undermined, the, dominance, of, aristotelian, philosophy, by, revitalizing, sextus, empiricus, skepticism, religious, studies, were, affected, by, the, growth, of, renaissance, humanism, when, pope, nicholas, v, initiated, the, translation, of, hebrew, and, greek, biblical, texts, and, other, texts, in, those, languages, to, contemporaneous, latin, humanist, values, spread, from, italy, in, the, 15th, century, students, and, scholars, went, to, italy, to, study, before, returning, to, their, homelands, carrying, humanistic, messages, printing, houses, dedicated, to, ancient, texts, were, established, in, venice, basel, and, paris, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, the, center, of, humanism, had, shifted, from, italy, to, northern, europe, with, erasmus, of, rotterdam, being, the, leading, humanist, scholar, the, longest, lasting, effect, of, renaissance, humanism, was, its, education, curriculum, and, methods, humanists, insisted, on, the, importance, of, classical, literature, in, providing, intellectual, discipline, moral, standards, and, a, civilized, taste, for, the, elite, an, educational, approach, that, reached, the, contemporary, era, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, humanistic, ideas, resurfaced, this, time, further, from, religion, and, classical, literature, science, and, intellectualism, advanced, and, humanists, argued, that, rationality, could, replace, deism, as, the, means, with, which, to, understand, the, world, humanistic, values, such, as, tolerance, and, opposition, to, slavery, started, to, take, shape, new, philosophical, social, and, political, ideas, appeared, some, thinkers, rejected, theism, outright, and, atheism, deism, and, hostility, to, organized, religion, were, formed, during, the, enlightenment, baruch, spinoza, redefined, god, as, signifying, the, totality, of, nature, spinoza, was, accused, of, atheism, but, remained, silent, on, the, matter, naturalism, was, also, advanced, by, prominent, encyclop, distes, baron, d, holbach, wrote, the, polemic, system, of, nature, claiming, that, religion, was, built, on, fear, and, had, helped, tyrants, throughout, history, diderot, and, helvetius, combined, their, materialism, with, sharp, political, critique, also, during, the, enlightenment, the, abstract, conception, of, humanity, started, forming, a, critical, juncture, for, the, construction, of, humanist, philosophy, previous, appeals, to, men, now, shifted, toward, man, to, illustrate, this, point, scholar, tony, davies, points, to, political, documents, like, the, social, contract, 1762, of, rousseau, in, which, he, says, man, is, born, free, but, is, everywhere, in, chains, likewise, thomas, paine, s, rights, of, man, uses, the, singular, form, of, the, word, revealing, a, universal, conception, of, man, in, parallel, baconian, empiricism, though, not, humanism, per, se, led, to, thomas, hobbes, s, materialism, scholar, j, brent, crosson, argues, that, while, there, is, a, widely, held, belief, that, the, birth, of, humanism, was, solely, a, european, affair, intellectual, thought, from, africa, and, asia, significantly, contributed, as, well, he, also, notes, that, during, enlightenment, the, universal, man, did, not, encompass, all, humans, but, was, shaped, by, gender, and, race, according, to, crosson, the, shift, from, man, to, human, started, during, enlightenment, and, is, still, ongoing, crosson, also, argues, that, enlightenment, especially, in, britain, produced, not, only, a, notion, of, universal, man, but, also, gave, birth, to, pseudoscientific, ideas, such, as, those, about, differences, between, races, that, shaped, european, history, french, philosopher, auguste, comte, 1798, 1857, introduced, the, idea, which, is, sometimes, attributed, to, thomas, paine, of, a, religion, of, humanity, according, to, scholar, tony, davies, this, was, intended, to, be, an, atheist, cult, based, on, some, humanistic, tenets, and, had, some, prominent, members, but, soon, declined, it, was, nonetheless, influential, during, the, 19th, century, and, its, humanism, and, rejection, of, supernaturalism, are, echoed, in, the, works, of, later, authors, such, as, oscar, wilde, george, holyoake, who, coined, the, word, secularism, george, eliot, mile, zola, and, e, s, beesly, paine, s, the, age, of, reason, along, with, the, 19th, century, biblical, criticism, of, the, german, hegelians, david, strauss, and, ludwig, feuerbach, also, contributed, to, new, forms, of, humanism, advances, in, science, and, philosophy, provided, scholars, with, further, alternatives, to, religious, belief, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, natural, selection, offered, naturalists, an, explanation, for, the, plurality, of, species, darwin, s, theory, also, suggested, humans, are, simply, a, natural, species, contradicting, the, traditional, theological, view, of, humans, as, more, than, animals, philosophers, ludwig, feuerbach, friedrich, nietzsche, and, karl, marx, attacked, religion, on, several, grounds, and, theologians, david, strauss, and, julius, wellhausen, questioned, the, bible, in, parallel, utilitarianism, was, developed, in, britain, through, the, works, of, jeremy, bentham, and, john, stuart, mill, utilitarianism, a, moral, philosophy, centers, its, attention, on, human, happiness, aiming, to, eliminate, human, and, animal, pain, via, natural, means, in, europe, and, the, us, as, philosophical, critiques, of, theistic, beliefs, grew, large, parts, of, society, distanced, themselves, from, religion, ethical, societies, were, formed, leading, to, the, contemporary, humanist, movement, the, rise, of, rationalism, and, the, scientific, method, was, followed, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, britain, by, the, start, of, many, rationalist, and, ethical, associations, such, as, the, national, secular, society, the, ethical, union, and, the, rationalist, press, association, in, the, 20th, century, humanism, was, further, promoted, by, the, work, of, philosophers, such, as, a, j, ayer, antony, flew, and, bertrand, russell, whose, advocacy, of, atheism, in, why, i, am, not, a, christian, further, popularized, humanist, ideas, in, 1963, the, british, humanist, association, evolved, out, of, the, ethical, union, and, merged, with, many, smaller, ethical, and, rationalist, groups, elsewhere, in, europe, humanist, organizations, also, flourished, in, the, netherlands, the, dutch, humanist, alliance, gained, a, wide, base, of, support, after, world, war, ii, in, norway, the, norwegian, humanist, association, gained, popular, support, in, the, us, humanism, evolved, with, the, aid, of, significant, figures, of, the, unitarian, church, humanist, magazines, began, to, appear, including, the, new, humanist, which, published, the, humanist, manifesto, i, in, 1933, the, american, ethical, union, emerged, from, newly, founded, small, ethicist, societies, the, american, humanist, association, aha, was, established, in, 1941, and, became, as, popular, as, some, of, its, european, counterparts, the, aha, spread, to, all, states, and, some, prominent, public, figures, such, as, isaac, asimov, john, dewey, erich, fromm, paul, kurtz, carl, sagan, and, gene, roddenberry, became, members, humanist, organizations, from, all, continents, formed, the, international, humanist, and, ethical, union, iheu, which, is, now, known, as, humanists, international, and, promotes, the, humanist, agenda, via, the, united, nations, organizations, unesco, and, unicef, early, 20th, century, naturalists, who, viewed, their, humanism, as, a, religion, and, participated, in, church, like, congregations, used, the, term, religious, humanism, religious, humanism, appeared, mostly, in, the, us, and, is, now, rarely, practiced, the, american, humanist, association, arose, from, religious, humanism, the, same, term, has, been, used, by, religious, groups, such, as, the, quakers, to, describe, their, humanistic, theology, the, term, renaissance, humanism, was, given, to, a, tradition, of, cultural, and, educational, reform, engaged, in, by, civic, and, ecclesiastical, chancellors, book, collectors, educators, and, writers, that, developed, during, the, 14th, and, early, 15th, centuries, by, the, late, 15th, century, these, academics, began, to, be, referred, to, as, umanisti, humanists, while, modern, humanism, s, roots, can, be, traced, to, the, renaissance, renaissance, humanism, vastly, differs, from, it, other, terms, using, humanism, in, their, name, include, these, varieties, of, humanism, are, now, largely, of, historical, interest, only, some, ethical, movements, continue, eg, new, york, society, for, ethical, culture, but, in, general, humanism, no, longer, needs, any, qualification, because, the, lifestance, is, by, definition, naturalistic, scientific, and, secular, however, according, to, andrew, copson, the, view, that, there, are, still, two, types, of, humanism, religious, and, secular, has, begun, to, seriously, muddy, the, conceptual, water, humanism, is, strongly, linked, to, rationality, for, humanists, humans, are, reasonable, beings, and, reasoning, and, the, scientific, method, are, means, of, finding, truth, humanists, argue, science, and, rationality, have, driven, successful, developments, in, various, fields, while, the, invocation, of, supernatural, phenomena, fails, to, coherently, explain, the, world, one, form, of, irrational, thinking, is, adducing, humanists, are, skeptical, of, explanations, of, natural, phenomena, or, diseases, that, rely, on, hidden, agencies, human, autonomy, is, another, hallmark, of, humanist, philosophy, for, people, to, be, autonomous, their, beliefs, and, actions, must, be, the, result, of, their, own, reasoning, for, humanists, autonomy, dignifies, each, individual, without, autonomy, people, s, humanity, is, lessened, humanists, also, consider, human, essence, to, be, universal, irrespective, of, race, and, social, status, diminishing, the, importance, of, collective, identities, and, signifying, the, importance, of, individuals, immanuel, kant, provided, the, modern, philosophical, basis, of, the, humanist, narrative, his, theory, of, critical, philosophy, formed, the, basis, of, the, world, of, knowledge, defending, rationalism, and, grounding, it, in, the, empirical, world, he, also, supported, the, idea, of, the, moral, autonomy, of, the, individual, which, is, fundamental, to, his, philosophy, according, to, kant, morality, is, the, product, of, the, way, humans, live, and, not, a, set, of, fixed, values, instead, of, a, universal, ethic, code, kant, suggested, a, universal, procedure, that, shapes, the, ethics, that, differ, among, groups, of, people, philosopher, and, humanist, advocate, corliss, lamont, in, his, book, the, philosophy, of, humanism, 1997, states, in, the, humanist, ethics, the, chief, end, of, thought, and, action, is, to, further, this, earthly, human, interests, on, behalf, of, the, greater, glory, of, people, the, watchword, of, humanism, is, happiness, for, all, humanity, in, this, existence, as, contrasted, with, salvation, for, the, individual, soul, in, a, future, existence, and, the, glorification, of, a, supernatural, supreme, being, it, heartily, welcomes, all, life, enhancing, and, healthy, pleasures, from, the, vigorous, enjoyments, of, youth, to, the, contemplative, delights, of, mellowed, age, from, the, simple, gratifications, of, food, and, drink, sunshine, and, sports, to, the, more, complex, appreciation, of, art, and, literature, friendship, and, social, communion, the, humanist, attitude, toward, morality, has, changed, since, its, beginning, starting, in, the, 18th, century, humanists, were, oriented, toward, an, objective, and, universalist, stance, on, ethics, both, utilitarian, philosophy, which, aims, to, increase, human, happiness, and, decrease, suffering, and, kantian, ethics, which, states, one, should, act, in, accordance, with, maxims, one, could, will, to, become, a, universal, law, shaped, the, humanist, moral, narrative, until, the, early, 20th, century, because, the, concepts, of, free, will, and, reason, are, not, based, on, scientific, naturalism, their, influence, on, humanists, remained, in, the, early, 20th, century, but, was, reduced, by, social, progressiveness, and, egalitarianism, as, part, of, social, changes, in, the, late, 20th, century, humanist, ethics, evolved, to, support, secularism, civil, rights, personal, autonomy, religious, toleration, multiculturalism, and, cosmopolitanism, a, naturalistic, criticism, of, humanistic, morality, is, the, denial, of, the, existence, of, morality, for, naturalistic, skeptics, morality, was, not, hardwired, within, humans, during, their, evolution, humans, are, primarily, selfish, and, self, centered, defending, humanist, morality, humanist, philosopher, john, r, shook, makes, three, observations, that, lead, him, to, the, acceptance, of, morality, according, to, shook, homo, sapiens, has, a, concept, of, morality, that, must, have, been, with, the, species, since, the, beginning, of, human, history, developing, by, recognizing, and, thinking, upon, behaviors, he, adds, morality, is, universal, among, human, cultures, and, all, cultures, strive, to, improve, their, moral, level, shook, concludes, that, while, morality, was, initially, generated, by, our, genes, culture, shaped, human, morals, and, continues, to, do, so, he, calls, moral, naturalism, the, view, that, morality, is, a, natural, phenomenon, can, be, scientifically, studied, and, is, a, tool, rather, than, a, set, of, doctrines, that, was, used, to, develop, human, culture, humanist, philosopher, brian, ellis, advocates, a, social, humanist, theory, of, morality, called, social, contractual, utilitarianism, which, is, based, on, hume, s, naturalism, and, empathy, aristotelian, virtue, theory, and, kant, s, idealism, according, to, ellis, morality, should, aim, for, eudaimonia, an, aristotelian, concept, that, combines, a, satisfying, life, with, virtue, and, happiness, by, improving, societies, worldwide, humanist, andrew, copson, takes, a, consequentialist, and, utilitarian, approach, to, morality, according, to, copson, all, humanist, ethical, traits, aim, at, human, welfare, philosopher, stephen, law, emphasizes, some, principles, of, humanist, ethics, respect, for, personal, moral, autonomy, rejection, of, god, given, moral, commands, an, aim, for, human, well, being, and, emphasiz, the, role, of, reason, in, making, moral, judgements, humanism, s, godless, approach, to, morality, has, driven, criticism, from, religious, commentators, the, necessity, for, a, divine, being, delivering, sets, of, doctrines, for, morals, to, exist, is, a, common, argument, according, to, dostoevsky, s, character, ivan, karam, zov, in, the, brothers, karamazov, if, god, does, not, exist, then, everything, is, permitted, this, argument, suggests, chaos, will, ensue, if, religious, belief, disappears, for, humanists, theism, is, an, obstacle, to, morality, rather, than, a, prerequisite, for, it, according, to, humanists, acting, only, out, of, fear, adherence, to, dogma, and, expectation, of, a, reward, is, a, selfish, motivation, rather, than, morality, humanists, point, to, the, subjectivity, of, the, supposedly, objective, divine, commands, by, referring, to, the, euthyphro, dilemma, originally, posed, by, socrates, does, god, command, something, because, it, is, good, or, is, something, good, because, god, commands, it, if, goodness, is, independent, from, god, humans, can, reach, goodness, without, religion, but, relativism, is, elicited, if, god, creates, goodness, another, argument, against, this, religious, criticism, is, the, human, made, nature, of, morality, even, through, religious, means, the, interpretation, of, holy, scriptures, almost, always, includes, human, reasoning, different, interpreters, reach, contradictory, theories, humanism, has, widely, been, seen, as, antithetical, to, religion, philosopher, of, religion, david, kline, traces, the, roots, of, this, animosity, since, the, renaissance, when, humanistic, views, deconstructed, the, previous, religiously, defined, order, kline, describes, several, ways, this, antithesis, has, evolved, kline, notes, the, emergence, of, a, confident, human, made, knowledge, which, was, a, new, way, of, epistemology, repelled, the, church, from, its, authoritative, position, kline, uses, the, paradigm, of, non, humanists, copernicus, kepler, and, galileo, to, illustrate, how, scientific, discoveries, added, to, the, deconstruction, of, the, religious, narrative, in, favor, of, human, generated, knowledge, this, ultimately, uncoupled, the, fate, of, humans, from, the, divine, will, prompting, social, and, political, shifts, the, relation, of, state, and, citizens, changed, as, civic, humanistic, principles, emerged, people, were, no, longer, to, be, servile, to, religiously, grounded, monarchies, but, could, pursue, their, own, destinies, kline, also, points, at, the, aspects, of, personal, belief, that, added, to, the, hostility, between, humanism, and, religion, humanism, was, linked, with, prominent, thinkers, who, advocated, against, the, existence, of, god, using, rationalistic, arguments, critique, of, theism, continued, through, the, humanistic, revolutions, in, europe, challenging, religious, worldviews, attitudes, and, superstitions, on, a, rational, basis, a, tendency, that, continued, to, the, 20th, century, according, to, stephen, law, humanist, adherence, to, secularism, placed, humans, at, odds, with, religion, especially, nationally, dominant, religions, striving, to, retain, privileges, gained, in, the, last, centuries, worth, notes, religious, persons, can, be, secularists, law, notes, secularism, is, criticized, for, suppressing, freedom, of, expression, of, religious, persons, but, firmly, denies, such, accusation, instead, he, says, secularism, protects, this, kind, of, freedom, but, opposes, the, privileged, status, of, religious, views, according, to, andrew, copson, humanism, is, not, incompatible, with, some, aspects, of, religion, he, observes, that, components, like, belief, practice, identity, and, culture, can, coexist, allowing, an, individual, who, subscribes, to, only, a, few, religious, doctrines, to, also, identify, as, a, humanist, copson, adds, that, religious, critics, usually, frame, humanism, as, an, enemy, of, religion, but, most, humanists, are, proponents, of, religious, tolerance, or, exhibit, a, curiosity, about, religion, s, effects, in, society, and, politics, commenting, only, a, few, are, regularly, outraged, by, other, people, s, false, beliefs, per, se, in, the, 19th, century, along, with, the, decline, of, religion, and, its, accompanied, teleology, the, question, of, the, meaning, of, life, became, more, prominent, unlike, religions, humanism, does, not, have, a, definite, view, on, the, meaning, of, life, humanists, commonly, say, people, create, rather, than, discover, meaning, while, philosophers, such, as, nietzsche, and, sartre, wrote, on, the, meaning, of, life, in, a, godless, world, the, work, of, albert, camus, has, echoed, and, shaped, humanism, in, camus, the, myth, of, sisyphus, he, quotes, a, greek, myth, in, which, the, absurd, hero, sisyphus, is, destined, to, push, a, heavy, rock, up, a, hill, the, rock, slips, back, and, he, must, repeat, the, task, sisyphus, is, negating, gods, and, preset, meanings, of, life, but, argues, that, life, has, value, and, significance, and, that, each, individual, is, able, to, create, their, meanings, of, life, camus, thus, highlights, the, importance, of, personal, agency, and, self, determination, that, lie, at, the, centre, of, humanism, personal, humanist, interpretations, of, the, meaning, of, life, vary, from, the, pursuit, of, happiness, without, recklessness, and, excesses, to, participation, in, human, history, and, connection, with, loved, ones, living, animals, and, plants, some, answers, are, close, to, those, of, religious, discourse, if, the, appeal, to, divinity, is, overlooked, according, to, humanist, professor, peter, derks, elements, that, contribute, to, the, meaning, of, life, are, a, morally, worthy, purpose, in, life, positive, self, evaluation, an, understanding, of, one, s, environment, being, seen, and, understood, by, others, the, ability, to, emotionally, connect, with, others, and, a, desire, to, have, a, meaning, in, life, humanist, professor, anthony, b, pinn, places, the, meaning, of, life, in, the, quest, of, what, he, calls, complex, subjectivity, pinn, who, is, advocating, for, a, non, theistic, humanistic, religion, inspired, by, african, cultures, says, seeking, the, never, reaching, meaning, of, life, contributes, to, well, being, and, that, rituals, and, ceremonies, which, are, occasions, for, reflection, provide, an, opportunity, to, assess, the, meaning, of, life, improving, well, being, the, hallmark, of, contemporary, humanism, in, politics, is, the, demand, for, secularism, philosopher, alan, haworth, said, secularism, delivers, fair, treatment, to, all, citizens, of, a, nation, state, since, all, are, treated, without, discrimination, religion, is, a, private, issue, and, the, state, should, have, no, power, over, it, he, also, argues, that, secularism, helps, plurality, and, diversity, which, are, fundamental, aspects, of, our, modern, world, while, barbarism, and, violence, can, be, found, in, most, civilizations, haworth, notes, religion, usually, fuels, rhetoric, and, enables, these, actions, he, also, said, the, values, of, hard, work, honesty, and, charity, are, found, in, other, civilizations, according, to, haworth, humanism, opposes, the, irrationality, of, nationalism, and, totalitarianism, whether, these, are, part, of, fascism, or, marxist, leninist, communism, according, to, professor, joseph, o, baker, in, political, theory, contemporary, humanism, is, formed, by, two, main, tendencies, the, first, is, individualistic, and, the, second, inclines, to, collectivism, the, trajectory, of, each, tendency, can, lead, to, libertarianism, and, socialism, respectively, but, a, range, of, combinations, exists, individualistic, humanists, often, have, a, philosophical, perspective, of, humanism, in, politics, these, are, inclined, to, libertarianism, and, in, ethics, tend, to, follow, a, scientistic, approach, collectivists, have, a, more, applied, view, of, humanism, lean, toward, socialism, and, have, a, humanitarian, approach, to, ethics, the, second, group, has, connections, with, the, thought, of, young, marx, especially, his, anthropological, views, rejecting, his, political, practices, a, factor, that, repels, many, humanists, from, the, libertarian, view, is, the, neoliberal, or, capitalistic, consequences, they, feel, it, entails, humanism, has, been, a, part, of, both, major, 20th, century, ideological, currents, liberalism, and, marxism, early, 19th, century, socialism, was, connected, to, humanism, in, the, 20th, century, a, humanistic, interpretation, of, marxism, focused, on, marx, s, early, writings, viewing, marxism, not, as, scientific, socialism, but, as, a, philosophical, critique, aimed, at, the, overcoming, of, alienation, in, the, us, liberalism, is, associated, mostly, with, humanistic, principles, which, is, distinct, from, the, european, use, of, the, same, word, which, has, economical, connotations, in, the, post, 1945, era, jean, paul, sartre, and, other, french, existentialists, advocated, for, humanism, linking, it, to, socialism, while, trying, to, stay, neutral, during, the, cold, war, humanist, counseling, is, humanism, inspired, applied, psychology, which, is, a, major, current, of, counseling, there, are, various, approaches, such, as, discussion, and, critical, thinking, replying, to, existential, anxiety, and, focusing, on, social, and, political, dimensions, of, problems, humanist, counseling, focuses, on, respecting, the, client, s, worldview, and, placing, it, in, the, correct, cultural, context, the, approach, emphasizes, an, individual, s, inherent, drive, towards, self, actualization, and, creativity, it, also, recognizes, the, importance, of, moral, questions, about, one, s, interactions, with, people, according, to, one, s, worldview, this, is, examined, using, a, process, of, dialogue, humanist, counseling, originated, in, post, world, war, ii, netherlands, humanistic, counseling, is, based, on, the, works, of, psychologists, carl, rogers, and, abraham, maslow, it, introduced, a, positive, humanistic, psychology, in, response, to, what, rogers, and, maslow, viewed, as, the, over, pessimistic, view, of, psychoanalysis, in, the, early, 1960s, other, sources, include, the, philosophies, of, existentialism, and, phenomenology, some, modern, counseling, organizations, have, humanist, origins, like, the, british, association, for, counselling, and, psychotherapy, which, was, founded, by, harold, blackham, which, he, developed, alongside, the, british, humanist, association, s, humanist, counselling, service, modern, day, humanist, pastoral, care, in, the, uk, and, the, netherlands, draws, on, elements, of, humanistic, psychology, demographic, data, about, humanists, is, sparse, scholar, yasmin, trejo, examined, the, results, of, pew, research, center, s, 2014, religious, landscape, study, trejo, did, not, use, self, identification, to, measure, humanists, but, combined, the, answers, of, two, questions, do, you, believe, in, god, or, a, universal, spirit, she, chose, those, who, answered, no, and, when, it, comes, to, questions, of, right, or, wrong, which, of, the, following, do, you, look, to, most, for, guidance, picking, answers, scientific, information, and, philosophy, and, reason, according, to, trejo, most, humanists, identify, as, atheist, or, agnostic, 37, and, 18, 29, as, nothing, in, particular, while, 16, of, humanists, identify, as, religious, she, also, found, most, humanists, 80, were, raised, in, a, religious, background, sixty, percent, of, humanists, are, married, to, non, religious, spouses, while, one, quarter, are, married, to, a, christian, there, is, a, gender, divide, among, humanists, 67, percent, are, male, trejo, says, this, can, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, more, males, self, identify, as, atheist, while, women, have, stronger, connections, to, religion, because, of, socialization, community, influence, and, stereotypes, some, women, especially, catholic, latinas, are, expected, to, be, religious, and, many, of, them, abide, by, their, community, expectations, other, findings, note, the, high, level, of, education, of, most, humanists, indicating, a, higher, socioeconomic, status, the, population, of, humanists, is, overwhelming, non, hispanic, white, according, to, trejo, this, is, because, minority, groups, are, usually, very, religious, criticism, of, humanism, focus, on, its, adherence, to, human, rights, which, some, critics, have, called, western, critics, say, humanist, values, have, become, a, tool, of, western, moral, dominance, which, is, a, form, of, neo, colonialism, that, leads, to, oppression, and, a, lack, of, ethical, diversity, other, critics, namely, feminists, black, activists, postcolonial, critics, and, gay, and, lesbian, advocates, say, humanism, is, an, oppressive, philosophy, because, it, is, not, free, from, the, biases, of, the, white, heterosexual, males, who, shaped, it, history, professor, samuel, moyn, attacks, humanism, for, its, connection, to, human, rights, according, to, moyn, the, concept, of, human, rights, in, the, 1960s, was, a, declaration, of, anti, colonial, struggle, but, that, idea, was, later, transformed, into, an, impossible, utopian, vision, replacing, the, failing, utopias, of, the, 20th, century, the, humanist, use, of, human, rights, rhetoric, thus, turns, human, rights, into, a, moral, tool, that, is, impractical, and, ultimately, non, political, he, also, notes, a, commonality, between, humanism, and, the, catholic, discourse, on, human, dignity, anthropology, professor, talal, asad, argues, humanism, is, a, project, of, modernity, and, a, secularized, continuation, of, western, christian, theology, according, to, asad, just, as, the, catholic, church, passed, the, christian, doctrine, of, love, to, africa, and, asia, while, assisting, in, the, enslavement, of, large, parts, of, their, population, humanist, values, have, at, times, been, a, pretext, for, western, countries, to, expand, their, influence, to, other, parts, of, the, world, to, humanize, barbarians, asad, has, also, said, humanism, is, not, a, purely, secular, phenomenon, but, takes, the, idea, of, the, essence, of, humanity, from, christianity, according, to, asad, western, humanism, cannot, incorporate, other, humanistic, traditions, such, as, those, from, india, and, china, without, subsuming, and, ultimately, eliminating, them, sociology, professor, didier, fassin, has, stated, that, humanism, s, focus, on, empathy, and, compassion, rather, than, goodness, and, justice, is, a, problem, according, to, fassin, humanism, originated, in, the, christian, tradition, particularly, the, parable, of, the, good, samaritan, in, which, empathy, is, universalized, fassin, has, also, argued, that, humanism, s, central, essence, the, sanctity, of, human, life, is, a, religious, victory, hidden, in, a, secular, wrapper, the, main, criticism, from, evangelical, christians, such, as, tim, lahaye, is, that, humanism, destroys, traditional, family, and, moral, values, according, to, corliss, lamont, this, criticism, is, a, malicious, campaign, by, religious, fanatics, the, so, called, moral, majority, who, need, a, demonic, scapegoat, to, rally, its, followers, other, religious, opponents, scorn, humanism, by, stating, it, is, materialistic, thereby, diminishing, humanity, because, it, denies, the, spiritual, nature, and, needs, of, man, also, because, the, goal, in, life, is, the, acquisition, of, material, goods, humanism, produces, greed, and, selfishness, in, response, to, this, criticism, norman, states, that, there, is, absolutely, no, reason, why, humanists, should, be, committed, to, the, view, that, the, only, things, worth, living, for, are, material, goods, such, an, accusation, he, says, is, based, on, a, sloppy, understanding, of, materialism, however, he, does, acknowledge, a, tension, in, humanism, that, because, of, its, championing, of, scientific, knowledge, it, appears, to, be, committed, to, a, materialistic, conception, of, human, beings, as, physical, systems, and, therefore, as, not, much, different, from, anything, else, in, the, universe, humanism, has, frequently, been, criticised, for, its, vagueness, and, the, difficulty, of, defining, the, term, according, to, paul, kurtz, humanism, is, so, charged, with, levels, of, emotion, and, rhetoric, that, its, meaning, is, often, vague, and, ambiguous, for, giustiniani, the, meaning, of, humanism, has, so, many, shades, that, to, analyze, all, of, them, is, hardly, feasible, nicolas, walter, points, out, that, most, of, the, people, in, the, past, who, have, called, themselves, or, been, called, humanists, would, reject, many, of, today, s, tenets, the, origins, of, humanism, he, writes, are, so, contradictory, and, confusing, that, it, is, often, meaningless, on, its, own, andrew, copson, notes, that, the, suggestion, that, there, are, two, types, of, humanism, religious, and, secular, has, begun, to, seriously, muddy, the, conceptual, water, according, to, tony, davies, the, meaning, of, humanism, is, the, semantic, tangle, or, grapple, that, makes, its, meaning, so, difficult, to, grasp, for, sarah, bakewell, humanism, is, a, semantic, cloud, of, meanings, and, implications, none, attachable, to, any, particular, theorist, or, practitioner, yet, the, difficulty, of, defining, humanism, is, not, necessarily, a, problem, davies, avoids, offering, a, definition, choosing, instead, to, stress, the, plurality, complexity, and, fluidity, of, meanings, jeaneane, fowler, argues, that, humanism, is, indefinable, precisely, because, of, its, particular, dynamism, and, the, acknowledged, vagueness, of, the, term, far, from, being, a, disadvantage, is, an, asset, antihumanism, is, a, philosophical, theory, that, rejects, humanism, as, a, pre, scientific, ideology, this, argument, developed, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, in, parallel, with, the, advancement, of, humanism, prominent, thinkers, questioned, the, metaphysics, of, humanism, and, the, human, nature, of, its, concept, of, freedom, nietzsche, while, departing, from, a, humanistic, pro, enlightenment, viewpoint, criticized, humanism, for, illusions, on, a, number, of, topics, especially, the, nature, of, truth, according, to, nietzsche, objective, truth, is, an, anthropomorphic, illusion, and, humanism, is, meaningless, and, replacing, theism, with, reason, and, science, simply, replaces, one, religion, with, another, according, to, karl, marx, humanism, is, a, bourgeois, project, that, inaccurately, attempts, to, present, itself, as, radical, after, the, atrocities, of, world, war, ii, questions, about, human, nature, and, the, concept, of, humanity, were, renewed, during, the, cold, war, influential, marxist, philosopher, louis, althusser, introduced, the, term, theoretical, antihumanism, to, attack, both, humanism, and, humanist, like, socialist, currents, eschewing, more, structural, and, formal, interpretations, of, marx, according, to, althusser, marx, s, early, writings, resonate, with, the, humanistic, idealism, of, hegel, kant, and, feuerbach, but, marx, radically, moved, toward, scientific, socialism, in, 1845, rejecting, concepts, such, as, the, essence, of, man, humanist, organizations, exist, in, several, countries, humanists, international, is, a, global, organization, the, three, countries, with, the, highest, numbers, of, humanist, international, member, organisations, are, the, uk, india, and, the, us, the, largest, humanist, organisation, is, the, norwegian, humanist, association, humanists, uk, formerly, the, british, humanist, association, and, the, american, humanist, association, are, two, of, the, oldest, humanist, organizations, in, 2015, london, based, humanists, uk, had, around, 28, 000, members, its, membership, includes, some, high, profile, people, such, as, richard, dawkins, brian, cox, salman, rushdie, polly, toynbee, and, stephen, fry, who, are, known, for, their, participation, in, public, debate, promoting, secularism, and, objecting, to, state, funding, for, faith, based, institutions, humanists, uk, organizes, and, conducts, non, religious, ceremonies, for, weddings, namings, comings, of, age, and, funerals, the, american, humanist, association, aha, was, formed, in, 1941, from, previous, humanist, associations, its, journal, the, humanist, is, the, continuation, of, a, previous, publication, the, humanist, bulletin, in, 1953, the, aha, established, the, humanist, of, the, year, award, to, honor, individuals, who, promote, science, by, the, 1970s, it, became, a, well, recognized, organization, initiating, campaigns, for, abortion, rights, and, opposing, discriminatory, policies, this, resulted, in, the, organization, becoming, a, target, of, the, religious, right, by, the, 1980s
