gnosticism, from, ancient, greek, romanized, gn, stik, s, koine, greek, having, knowledge, is, a, collection, of, religious, ideas, and, systems, that, coalesced, in, the, late, 1st, century, ad, among, jewish, and, early, christian, sects, these, various, groups, emphasized, personal, spiritual, knowledge, gnosis, above, the, proto, orthodox, teachings, traditions, and, authority, of, religious, institutions, gnostic, cosmogony, generally, presents, a, distinction, between, a, supreme, hidden, god, and, a, malevolent, lesser, divinity, sometimes, associated, with, the, biblical, deity, yahweh, who, is, responsible, for, creating, the, material, universe, consequently, gnostics, considered, material, existence, flawed, or, evil, and, held, the, principal, element, of, salvation, to, be, direct, knowledge, of, the, hidden, divinity, attained, via, mystical, or, esoteric, insight, many, gnostic, texts, deal, not, in, concepts, of, sin, and, repentance, but, with, illusion, and, enlightenment, gnostic, writings, flourished, among, certain, christian, groups, in, the, mediterranean, world, around, the, second, century, when, the, fathers, of, the, early, church, denounced, them, as, heresy, efforts, to, destroy, these, texts, proved, largely, successful, resulting, in, the, survival, of, very, little, writing, by, gnostic, theologians, nonetheless, early, gnostic, teachers, such, as, valentinus, saw, their, beliefs, as, aligned, with, christianity, in, the, gnostic, christian, tradition, christ, is, seen, as, a, divine, being, which, has, taken, human, form, in, order, to, lead, humanity, back, to, recognition, of, its, own, divine, nature, however, gnosticism, is, not, a, single, standardized, system, and, the, emphasis, on, direct, experience, allows, for, a, wide, variety, of, teachings, including, distinct, currents, such, as, valentinianism, and, sethianism, in, the, persian, empire, gnostic, ideas, spread, as, far, as, china, via, the, related, movement, manichaeism, while, mandaeism, which, is, the, only, surviving, gnostic, religion, from, antiquity, is, found, in, iraq, iran, and, diaspora, communities, jorunn, buckley, posits, that, the, early, mandaeans, may, have, been, among, the, first, to, formulate, what, would, go, on, to, become, gnosticism, within, the, community, of, early, followers, of, jesus, for, centuries, most, scholarly, knowledge, about, gnosticism, was, limited, to, the, anti, heretical, writings, of, early, christian, figures, such, as, irenaeus, of, lyons, and, hippolytus, of, rome, there, was, a, renewed, interest, in, gnosticism, after, the, 1945, discovery, of, egypt, s, nag, hammadi, library, a, collection, of, rare, early, christian, and, gnostic, texts, including, the, gospel, of, thomas, and, the, apocryphon, of, john, elaine, pagels, has, noted, the, influence, of, sources, from, hellenistic, judaism, zoroastrianism, and, platonism, on, the, nag, hammadi, texts, since, the, 1990s, the, category, of, gnosticism, has, come, under, increasing, scrutiny, from, scholars, one, such, issue, is, whether, gnosticism, ought, to, be, considered, one, form, of, early, christianity, an, interreligious, phenomenon, or, an, independent, religion, going, further, than, this, other, contemporary, scholars, such, as, michael, allen, williams, karen, leigh, king, and, david, g, robertson, contest, whether, gnosticism, is, a, valid, or, useful, historical, term, or, if, it, was, an, artificial, category, framed, by, proto, orthodox, theologians, to, target, miscellaneous, christian, heretics, gnosis, is, a, feminine, greek, noun, which, means, knowledge, or, awareness, it, is, often, used, for, personal, knowledge, compared, with, intellectual, knowledge, e, dein, a, related, term, is, the, adjective, gnostikos, cognitive, a, reasonably, common, adjective, in, classical, greek, by, the, hellenistic, period, it, began, also, to, be, associated, with, greco, roman, mysteries, becoming, synonymous, with, the, greek, term, musterion, consequentially, gnosis, often, refers, to, knowledge, based, on, personal, experience, or, perception, in, a, religious, context, gnosis, is, mystical, or, esoteric, knowledge, based, on, direct, participation, with, the, divine, in, most, gnostic, systems, the, sufficient, cause, of, salvation, is, this, knowledge, of, acquaintance, with, the, divine, it, is, an, inward, knowing, comparable, to, that, encouraged, by, plotinus, neoplatonism, and, differs, from, proto, orthodox, christian, views, gnostics, are, those, who, are, oriented, toward, knowledge, and, understanding, or, perception, and, learning, as, a, particular, modality, for, living, the, usual, meaning, of, gnostikos, in, classical, greek, texts, is, learned, or, intellectual, such, as, used, by, plato, in, the, comparison, of, practical, praktikos, and, intellectual, gnostikos, plato, s, use, of, learned, is, fairly, typical, of, classical, texts, sometimes, employed, in, the, septuagint, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, adjective, is, not, used, in, the, new, testament, but, clement, of, alexandria, who, speaks, of, the, learned, gnostikos, christian, quite, often, uses, it, in, complimentary, terms, the, use, of, gnostikos, in, relation, to, heresy, originates, with, interpreters, of, irenaeus, some, scholars, consider, that, irenaeus, sometimes, uses, gnostikos, to, simply, mean, intellectual, whereas, his, mention, of, the, intellectual, sect, is, a, specific, designation, the, term, gnosticism, does, not, appear, in, ancient, sources, and, was, first, coined, in, the, 17th, century, by, henry, more, in, a, commentary, on, the, seven, letters, of, the, book, of, revelation, where, more, used, the, term, gnosticisme, to, describe, the, heresy, in, thyatira, the, term, gnosticism, was, derived, from, the, use, of, the, greek, adjective, gnostikos, greek, learned, intellectual, by, st, irenaeus, c, 185, ad, to, describe, the, school, of, valentinus, as, he, legomene, gnostike, haeresis, the, heresy, called, learned, gnostic, the, origins, of, gnosticism, are, obscure, and, still, disputed, gnosticism, is, largely, influenced, by, platonism, and, its, theory, of, forms, the, proto, orthodox, christian, groups, called, gnostics, a, heresy, of, christianity, but, according, to, the, modern, scholars, the, theology, s, origin, is, closely, related, to, jewish, sectarian, milieus, and, early, christian, sects, some, scholars, debate, gnosticism, s, origins, as, having, roots, in, buddhism, due, to, similarities, in, beliefs, but, ultimately, its, origins, are, unknown, some, scholars, prefer, to, speak, of, gnosis, when, referring, to, first, century, ideas, that, later, developed, into, gnosticism, and, to, reserve, the, term, gnosticism, for, the, synthesis, of, these, ideas, into, a, coherent, movement, in, the, second, century, according, to, james, m, robinson, no, gnostic, texts, clearly, pre, date, christianity, and, pre, christian, gnosticism, as, such, is, hardly, attested, in, a, way, to, settle, the, debate, once, and, for, all, most, popular, gnostic, sects, were, heavily, inspired, by, zoroastrianism, contemporary, scholarship, largely, agrees, that, gnosticism, has, jewish, christian, origins, originating, in, the, late, first, century, ad, in, nonrabbinical, jewish, sects, and, early, christian, sects, ethel, s, drower, adds, heterodox, judaism, in, galilee, and, samaria, appears, to, have, taken, shape, in, the, form, we, now, call, gnostic, and, it, may, well, have, existed, some, time, before, the, christian, era, xv, many, heads, of, gnostic, schools, were, identified, as, jewish, christians, by, church, fathers, and, hebrew, words, and, names, of, god, were, applied, in, some, gnostic, systems, the, cosmogonic, speculations, among, christian, gnostics, had, partial, origins, in, maaseh, breshit, and, maaseh, merkabah, this, thesis, is, most, notably, put, forward, by, gershom, scholem, 1897, 1982, and, gilles, quispel, 1916, 2006, scholem, detected, jewish, gnosis, in, the, imagery, of, merkabah, mysticism, which, can, also, be, found, in, certain, gnostic, documents, quispel, sees, gnosticism, as, an, independent, jewish, development, tracing, its, origins, to, alexandrian, jews, to, which, group, valentinus, was, also, connected, many, of, the, nag, hammadi, texts, make, reference, to, judaism, in, some, cases, with, a, violent, rejection, of, the, jewish, god, gershom, scholem, once, described, gnosticism, as, the, greatest, case, of, metaphysical, anti, semitism, professor, steven, bayme, said, gnosticism, would, be, better, characterized, as, anti, judaism, research, into, the, origins, of, gnosticism, shows, a, strong, jewish, influence, particularly, from, hekhalot, literature, within, early, christianity, the, teachings, of, paul, the, apostle, and, john, the, evangelist, may, have, been, a, starting, point, for, gnostic, ideas, with, a, growing, emphasis, on, the, opposition, between, flesh, and, spirit, the, value, of, charisma, and, the, disqualification, of, the, jewish, law, the, mortal, body, belonged, to, the, world, of, inferior, worldly, powers, the, archons, and, only, the, spirit, or, soul, could, be, saved, the, term, gnostikos, may, have, acquired, a, deeper, significance, here, alexandria, was, of, central, importance, for, the, birth, of, gnosticism, the, christian, ecclesia, i, e, congregation, church, was, of, jewish, christian, origin, but, also, attracted, greek, members, and, various, strands, of, thought, were, available, such, as, judaic, apocalypticism, speculation, on, divine, wisdom, greek, philosophy, and, hellenistic, mystery, religions, regarding, the, angel, christology, of, some, early, christians, darrell, hannah, notes, early, christians, understood, the, pre, incarnate, christ, ontologically, as, an, angel, this, true, angel, christology, took, many, forms, and, may, have, appeared, as, early, as, the, late, first, century, if, indeed, this, is, the, view, opposed, in, the, early, chapters, of, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, the, elchasaites, or, at, least, christians, influenced, by, them, paired, the, male, christ, with, the, female, holy, spirit, envisioning, both, as, two, gigantic, angels, some, valentinian, gnostics, supposed, that, christ, took, on, an, angelic, nature, and, that, he, might, be, the, saviour, of, angels, the, author, of, the, testament, of, solomon, held, christ, to, be, a, particularly, effective, thwarting, angel, in, the, exorcism, of, demons, the, author, of, de, centesima, and, epiphanius, ebionites, held, christ, to, have, been, the, highest, and, most, important, of, the, first, created, archangels, a, view, similar, in, many, respects, to, hermas, equation, of, christ, with, michael, finally, a, possible, exegetical, tradition, behind, the, ascension, of, isaiah, and, attested, by, origen, s, hebrew, master, may, witness, to, yet, another, angel, christology, as, well, as, an, angel, pneumatology, the, pseudepigraphical, christian, text, ascension, of, isaiah, identifies, jesus, with, angel, christology, and, i, heard, the, voice, of, the, most, high, the, father, of, my, lord, as, he, said, to, my, lord, christ, who, will, be, called, jesus, go, out, and, descend, through, all, the, heavens, the, shepherd, of, hermas, is, a, christian, literary, work, considered, as, canonical, scripture, by, some, of, the, early, church, fathers, such, as, irenaeus, jesus, is, identified, with, angel, christology, in, parable, 5, when, the, author, mentions, a, son, of, god, as, a, virtuous, man, filled, with, a, holy, pre, existent, spirit, in, the, 1880s, gnostic, connections, with, neo, platonism, were, proposed, ugo, bianchi, who, organised, the, congress, of, messina, of, 1966, on, the, origins, of, gnosticism, also, argued, for, orphic, and, platonic, origins, gnostics, borrowed, significant, ideas, and, terms, from, platonism, using, greek, philosophical, concepts, throughout, their, text, including, such, concepts, as, hypostasis, reality, existence, ousia, essence, substance, being, and, demiurge, creator, god, both, sethian, gnostics, and, valentinian, gnostics, seem, to, have, been, influenced, by, plato, middle, platonism, and, neo, pythagoreanism, academies, or, schools, of, thought, both, schools, attempted, an, effort, towards, conciliation, even, affiliation, with, late, antique, philosophy, and, were, rebuffed, by, some, neoplatonists, including, plotinus, early, research, into, the, origins, of, gnosticism, proposed, persian, origins, or, influences, spreading, to, europe, and, incorporating, jewish, elements, according, to, wilhelm, bousset, 1865, 1920, gnosticism, was, a, form, of, iranian, and, mesopotamian, syncretism, and, richard, august, reitzenstein, 1861, 1931, situated, the, origins, of, gnosticism, in, persia, carsten, colpe, b, 1929, has, analyzed, and, criticised, the, iranian, hypothesis, of, reitzenstein, showing, that, many, of, his, hypotheses, are, untenable, nevertheless, geo, widengren, 1907, 1996, argued, for, the, origin, of, mandaean, gnosticism, in, mazdean, zoroastrianism, zurvanism, in, conjunction, with, ideas, from, the, aramaic, mesopotamian, world, however, scholars, specializing, in, mandaeism, such, as, kurt, rudolph, mark, lidzbarski, rudolf, mac, ch, ethel, s, drower, james, f, mcgrath, charles, g, h, berl, jorunn, jacobsen, buckley, and, inasi, g, nd, z, argue, for, a, palestinian, origin, the, majority, of, these, scholars, believe, that, the, mandaeans, likely, have, a, historical, connection, with, john, the, baptist, s, inner, circle, of, disciples, charles, h, berl, who, is, also, a, linguist, specializing, in, mandaic, finds, palestinian, and, samaritan, aramaic, influence, on, mandaic, and, accepts, mandaeans, having, a, shared, palestinian, history, with, jews, in, 1966, at, the, congress, of, median, buddhologist, edward, conze, noted, phenomenological, commonalities, between, mahayana, buddhism, and, gnosticism, in, his, paper, buddhism, and, gnosis, following, an, early, suggestion, put, forward, by, isaac, jacob, schmidt, the, influence, of, buddhism, in, any, sense, on, either, the, gnostikos, valentinus, c, 170, or, the, nag, hammadi, texts, 3rd, century, is, not, supported, by, modern, scholarship, although, elaine, pagels, called, it, a, possibility, the, syrian, egyptian, traditions, postulate, a, remote, supreme, godhead, the, monad, from, this, highest, divinity, emanate, lower, divine, beings, known, as, aeons, the, demiurge, arises, among, the, aeons, and, creates, the, physical, world, divine, elements, fall, into, the, material, realm, and, are, latent, in, human, beings, redemption, from, the, fall, occurs, when, the, humans, obtain, gnosis, esoteric, or, intuitive, knowledge, of, the, divine, gnostic, systems, postulate, a, dualism, between, god, and, the, world, varying, from, the, radical, dualist, systems, of, manichaeism, to, the, mitigated, dualism, of, classic, gnostic, movements, radical, dualism, or, absolute, dualism, posits, two, co, equal, divine, forces, while, in, mitigated, dualism, one, of, the, two, principles, is, in, some, way, inferior, to, the, other, in, qualified, monism, the, second, entity, may, be, divine, or, semi, divine, valentinian, gnosticism, is, a, form, of, monism, expressed, in, terms, previously, used, in, a, dualistic, manner, gnostics, tended, toward, asceticism, especially, in, their, sexual, and, dietary, practice, in, other, areas, of, morality, gnostics, were, less, rigorously, ascetic, and, took, a, more, moderate, approach, to, correct, behavior, in, normative, early, christianity, the, church, administered, and, prescribed, the, correct, behavior, for, christians, while, in, gnosticism, it, was, the, internalised, motivation, that, was, important, ptolemy, s, epistle, to, flora, describes, a, general, asceticism, based, on, the, moral, inclination, of, the, individual, for, example, ritualistic, behavior, was, not, seen, to, possess, as, much, importance, as, any, other, practice, unless, it, was, based, on, a, personal, internal, motivation, the, role, women, played, in, gnosticism, is, still, being, explored, the, very, few, women, in, most, gnostic, literature, are, portrayed, as, chaotic, disobedient, and, enigmatic, however, the, nag, hammadi, texts, place, women, in, roles, of, leadership, and, heroism, in, many, gnostic, systems, god, is, known, as, the, monad, the, one, god, is, the, high, source, of, the, pleroma, the, region, of, light, the, various, emanations, of, god, are, called, ons, according, to, hippolytus, this, view, was, inspired, by, the, pythagoreans, who, called, the, first, thing, that, came, into, existence, the, monad, which, begat, the, dyad, which, begat, the, numbers, which, begat, the, point, begetting, lines, etc, pleroma, greek, fullness, refers, to, the, totality, of, god, s, powers, the, heavenly, pleroma, is, the, center, of, divine, life, a, region, of, light, above, the, term, is, not, to, be, understood, spatially, our, world, occupied, by, spiritual, beings, such, as, aeons, eternal, beings, and, sometimes, archons, jesus, is, interpreted, as, an, intermediary, aeon, who, was, sent, from, the, pleroma, with, whose, aid, humanity, can, recover, the, lost, knowledge, of, the, divine, origins, of, humanity, the, term, is, thus, a, central, element, of, gnostic, cosmology, pleroma, is, also, used, in, the, general, greek, language, and, is, used, by, the, greek, orthodox, church, in, this, general, form, since, the, word, appears, in, the, epistle, to, the, colossians, proponents, of, the, view, that, paul, was, actually, a, gnostic, such, as, elaine, pagels, view, the, reference, in, colossians, as, a, term, that, has, to, be, interpreted, in, a, gnostic, sense, the, supreme, light, or, consciousness, descends, through, a, series, of, stages, gradations, worlds, or, hypostases, becoming, progressively, more, material, and, embodied, in, time, it, will, turn, around, to, return, to, the, one, epistrophe, retracing, its, steps, through, spiritual, knowledge, and, contemplation, in, many, gnostic, systems, the, aeons, are, the, various, emanations, of, the, superior, god, or, monad, beginning, in, certain, gnostic, texts, with, the, hermaphroditic, aeon, barbelo, the, first, emanated, being, various, interactions, with, the, monad, occur, which, result, in, the, emanation, of, successive, pairs, of, aeons, often, in, male, female, pairings, called, syzygies, the, numbers, of, these, pairings, varied, from, text, to, text, though, some, identify, their, number, as, being, thirty, the, aeons, as, a, totality, constitute, the, pleroma, the, region, of, light, the, lowest, regions, of, the, pleroma, are, closest, to, the, darkness, that, is, the, physical, world, two, of, the, most, commonly, paired, ons, were, christ, and, sophia, greek, wisdom, the, latter, refers, to, christ, as, her, consort, in, a, valentinian, exposition, in, gnostic, tradition, the, name, sophia, greek, for, wisdom, refers, to, the, final, emanation, of, god, and, is, identified, with, the, anima, mundi, or, world, soul, she, is, occasionally, referred, to, by, the, hebrew, equivalent, of, achamoth, this, is, a, feature, of, ptolemy, s, version, of, the, valentinian, gnostic, myth, jewish, gnosticism, with, a, focus, on, sophia, was, active, by, 90, ad, in, most, if, not, all, versions, of, the, gnostic, myth, sophia, births, the, demiurge, who, in, turn, brings, about, the, creation, of, materiality, the, positive, and, negative, depictions, of, materiality, depend, on, the, myth, s, depictions, of, sophia, s, actions, sophia, in, this, highly, patriarchal, narrative, is, described, as, unruly, and, disobedient, which, is, due, to, her, bringing, a, creation, of, chaos, into, the, world, the, creation, of, the, demiurge, was, an, act, done, without, her, counterpart, s, consent, and, because, of, the, predefined, hierarchy, between, the, two, of, them, this, action, contributed, to, the, narrative, that, she, was, unruly, and, disobedient, sophia, emanating, without, her, partner, resulted, in, the, production, of, the, demiurge, greek, lit, public, builder, who, is, also, referred, to, as, yaldabaoth, and, variations, thereof, in, some, gnostic, texts, this, creature, is, concealed, outside, the, pleroma, in, isolation, and, thinking, itself, alone, it, creates, materiality, and, a, host, of, co, actors, referred, to, as, archons, the, demiurge, is, responsible, for, the, creation, of, humankind, trapping, elements, of, the, pleroma, stolen, from, sophia, inside, human, bodies, in, response, the, godhead, emanates, two, savior, aeons, christ, and, the, holy, spirit, christ, then, embodies, itself, in, the, form, of, jesus, in, order, to, be, able, to, teach, humans, how, to, achieve, gnosis, by, which, they, may, return, to, the, pleroma, the, term, demiurge, derives, from, the, latinized, form, of, the, greek, term, d, miourgos, literally, public, or, skilled, worker, this, figure, is, also, called, yaldabaoth, samael, aramaic, s, m, a, el, blind, god, or, saklas, syriac, s, kla, the, foolish, one, who, is, sometimes, ignorant, of, the, superior, god, and, sometimes, opposed, to, it, thus, in, the, latter, case, he, is, correspondingly, malevolent, other, names, or, identifications, are, ahriman, el, satan, and, yahweh, this, image, of, this, particular, creature, is, again, identified, in, the, revelation, of, jesus, christ, to, the, apostle, john, as, such, 17, now, in, my, vision, this, is, how, i, saw, the, horses, and, their, riders, they, wore, red, blue, and, yellow, breastplates, and, the, horses,

some, variants, of, gnosticism, used, the, term, archon, to, refer, to, several, servants, of, the, demiurge, according, to, origen, s, contra, celsum, a, sect, called, the, ophites, posited, the, existence, of, seven, archons, beginning, with, iadabaoth, or, ialdabaoth, who, created, the, six, that, follow, iao, sabaoth, adonaios, elaios, astaphanos, and, horaios, ialdabaoth, had, a, head, of, a, lion, other, gnostic, concepts, are, jesus, is, identified, by, some, gnostics, as, an, embodiment, of, the, supreme, being, who, became, incarnate, to, bring, gn, sis, to, the, earth, while, others, adamantly, denied, that, the, supreme, being, came, in, the, flesh, claiming, jesus, to, be, merely, a, human, who, attained, enlightenment, through, gnosis, and, taught, his, disciples, to, do, the, same, others, believed, jesus, was, divine, although, did, not, have, a, physical, body, reflected, in, the, later, docetist, movement, among, the, mandaeans, jesus, was, considered, a, m,

son, of, adam, and, eve, as, salvific, figures, three, periods, can, be, discerned, in, the, development, of, gnosticism, during, the, first, period, three, types, of, tradition, developed, the, movement, spread, in, areas, controlled, by, the, roman, empire, and, arian, goths, and, the, persian, empire, it, continued, to, develop, in, the, mediterranean, and, middle, east, before, and, during, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, but, decline, also, set, in, during, the, third, century, due, to, a, growing, aversion, from, the, nicene, church, and, the, economic, and, cultural, deterioration, of, the, roman, empire, conversion, to, islam, and, the, albigensian, crusade, 1209, 1229, greatly, reduced, the, remaining, number, of, gnostics, throughout, the, middle, ages, though, mandaean, communities, still, exist, in, iraq, iran, and, diaspora, communities, gnostic, and, pseudo, gnostic, ideas, became, influential, in, some, of, the, philosophies, of, various, esoteric, mystical, movements, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, in, europe, and, north, america, including, some, that, explicitly, identify, themselves, as, revivals, or, even, continuations, of, earlier, gnostic, groups, dillon, notes, that, gnosticism, raises, questions, about, the, development, of, early, christianity, the, christian, heresiologists, most, notably, irenaeus, regarded, gnosticism, as, a, christian, heresy, modern, scholarship, notes, that, early, christianity, was, diverse, and, christian, orthodoxy, only, settled, in, the, 4th, century, when, the, roman, empire, declined, and, gnosticism, lost, its, influence, gnostics, and, proto, orthodox, christians, shared, some, terminology, initially, they, were, hard, to, distinguish, from, each, other, according, to, walter, bauer, heresies, may, well, have, been, the, original, form, of, christianity, in, many, regions, this, theme, was, further, developed, by, elaine, pagels, who, argues, that, the, proto, orthodox, church, found, itself, in, debates, with, gnostic, christians, that, helped, them, to, stabilize, their, own, beliefs, according, to, gilles, quispel, catholicism, arose, in, response, to, gnosticism, establishing, safeguards, in, the, form, of, the, monarchic, episcopate, the, creed, and, the, canon, of, holy, books, the, gnostic, movements, may, contain, information, about, the, historical, jesus, since, some, texts, preserve, sayings, which, show, similarities, with, canonical, sayings, especially, the, gospel, of, thomas, has, a, significant, amount, of, parallel, sayings, yet, a, striking, difference, is, that, the, canonical, sayings, center, on, the, coming, endtime, while, the, thomas, sayings, center, on, a, kingdom, of, heaven, that, is, already, here, and, not, a, future, event, according, to, helmut, koester, this, is, because, the, thomas, sayings, are, older, implying, that, in, the, earliest, forms, of, christianity, jesus, was, regarded, as, a, wisdom, teacher, an, alternative, hypothesis, states, that, the, thomas, authors, wrote, in, the, second, century, changing, existing, sayings, and, eliminating, the, apocalyptic, concerns, according, to, april, deconick, such, a, change, occurred, when, the, end, time, did, not, come, and, the, thomasine, tradition, turned, toward, a, new, theology, of, mysticism, and, a, theological, commitment, to, a, fully, present, kingdom, of, heaven, here, and, now, where, their, church, had, attained, adam, and, eve, s, divine, status, before, the, fall, the, prologue, of, the, gospel, of, john, describes, the, incarnated, logos, the, light, that, came, to, earth, in, the, person, of, jesus, the, apocryphon, of, john, contains, a, scheme, of, three, descendants, from, the, heavenly, realm, the, third, one, being, jesus, just, as, in, the, gospel, of, john, the, similarities, probably, point, to, a, relationship, between, gnostic, ideas, and, the, johannine, community, according, to, raymond, brown, the, gospel, of, john, shows, the, development, of, certain, gnostic, ideas, especially, christ, as, heavenly, revealer, the, emphasis, on, light, versus, darkness, and, anti, jewish, animus, the, johannine, material, reveals, debates, about, the, redeemer, myth, the, johannine, letters, show, that, there, were, different, interpretations, of, the, gospel, story, and, the, johannine, images, may, have, contributed, to, second, century, gnostic, ideas, about, jesus, as, a, redeemer, who, descended, from, heaven, according, to, deconick, the, gospel, of, john, shows, a, transitional, system, from, early, christianity, to, gnostic, beliefs, in, a, god, who, transcends, our, world, according, to, deconick, john, may, show, a, bifurcation, of, the, idea, of, the, jewish, god, into, jesus, father, in, heaven, and, the, jews, father, the, father, of, the, devil, most, translations, say, of, father, the, devil, which, may, have, developed, into, the, gnostic, idea, of, the, monad, and, the, demiurge, tertullian, calls, paul, the, apostle, of, the, heretics, because, paul, s, writings, were, attractive, to, gnostics, and, interpreted, in, a, gnostic, way, while, jewish, christians, found, him, to, stray, from, the, jewish, roots, of, christianity, in, i, corinthians, 1, corinthians, 8, 10, paul, refers, to, some, church, members, as, having, knowledge, greek, ton, echonta, gnosin, james, dunn, writes, that, in, some, cases, paul, affirmed, views, that, were, closer, to, gnosticism, than, to, proto, orthodox, christianity, according, to, clement, of, alexandria, the, disciples, of, valentinus, said, that, valentinus, was, a, student, of, a, certain, theudas, who, was, a, student, of, paul, and, elaine, pagels, notes, that, paul, s, epistles, were, interpreted, by, valentinus, in, a, gnostic, way, and, paul, could, be, considered, a, proto, gnostic, as, well, as, a, proto, catholic, many, nag, hammadi, texts, including, for, example, the, prayer, of, paul, and, the, coptic, apocalypse, of, paul, consider, paul, to, be, the, great, apostle, the, fact, that, he, claimed, to, have, received, his, gospel, directly, by, revelation, from, god, appealed, to, the, gnostics, who, claimed, gnosis, from, the, risen, christ, the, naassenes, cainites, and, valentinians, referred, to, paul, s, epistles, timothy, freke, and, peter, gandy, have, expanded, upon, this, idea, of, paul, as, a, gnostic, teacher, although, their, premise, that, jesus, was, invented, by, early, christians, based, on, an, alleged, greco, roman, mystery, cult, has, been, dismissed, by, scholars, however, his, revelation, was, different, from, the, gnostic, revelations, although, elkesaites, and, mandaeans, were, found, mainly, in, mesopotamia, in, the, first, few, centuries, of, the, common, era, their, origins, appear, to, be, judean, israelite, in, the, jordan, valley, the, elkesaites, were, a, judeo, christian, baptismal, sect, that, originated, in, the, transjordan, and, were, active, between, 100, and, 400, ad, the, members, of, this, sect, performed, frequent, baptisms, for, purification, and, had, a, gnostic, disposition, 123, the, sect, is, named, after, its, leader, elkesai, according, to, joseph, lightfoot, the, church, father, epiphanius, writing, in, the, 4th, century, ad, seems, to, make, a, distinction, between, two, main, groups, within, the, essenes, of, those, that, came, before, his, time, and, during, it, the, ossaeans, and, the, nasaraeans, mandaeism, is, a, gnostic, monotheistic, and, ethnic, religion, 4, the, mandaeans, are, an, ethnoreligious, group, that, speak, a, dialect, of, eastern, aramaic, known, as, mandaic, they, are, the, only, surviving, gnostics, from, antiquity, their, religion, has, been, practiced, primarily, around, the, lower, karun, euphrates, and, tigris, and, the, rivers, that, surround, the, shatt, al, arab, waterway, part, of, southern, iraq, and, khuzestan, province, in, iran, mandaeism, is, still, practiced, in, small, numbers, in, parts, of, southern, iraq, and, the, iranian, province, of, khuzestan, and, there, are, thought, to, be, between, 60, 000, and, 70, 000, mandaeans, worldwide, the, name, mandaean, comes, from, the, aramaic, manda, meaning, knowledge, john, the, baptist, is, a, key, figure, in, the, religion, as, an, emphasis, on, baptism, is, part, of, their, core, beliefs, according, to, nathaniel, deutsch, mandaean, anthropogony, echoes, both, rabbinic, and, gnostic, accounts, mandaeans, revere, adam, abel, seth, enos, noah, shem, aram, and, especially, john, the, baptist, significant, amounts, of, original, mandaean, scripture, written, in, mandaean, aramaic, survive, in, the, modern, era, the, most, important, holy, scripture, is, known, as, the, ginza, rabba, and, has, portions, identified, by, some, scholars, as, being, copied, as, early, as, the, 2nd, 3rd, centuries, while, others, such, as, s, f, dunlap, place, it, in, the, 1st, century, there, is, also, the, qulasta, mandaean, prayerbook, and, the, mandaean, book, of, john, sidra, yahia, and, other, scriptures, mandaeans, believe, that, there, is, a, constant, battle, or, conflict, between, the, forces, of, good, and, evil, the, forces, of, good, are, represented, by, nhura, light, and, maia, hayyi, living, water, and, those, of, evil, are, represented, by, hshuka, darkness, and, maia, tahmi, dead, or, rancid, water, the, two, waters, are, mixed, in, all, things, in, order, to, achieve, a, balance, mandaeans, also, believe, in, an, afterlife, or, heaven, called, alma, d, nhura, world, of, light, in, mandaeism, the, world, of, light, is, ruled, by, a, supreme, god, known, as, hayyi, rabbi, the, great, life, or, the, great, living, god, god, is, so, great, vast, and, incomprehensible, that, no, words, can, fully, depict, how, immense, god, is, it, is, believed, that, an, innumerable, number, of, uthras, angels, or, guardians, 8, manifested, from, the, light, surround, and, perform, acts, of, worship, to, praise, and, honor, god, they, inhabit, worlds, separate, from, the, lightworld, and, some, are, commonly, referred, to, as, emanations, and, are, subservient, beings, to, the, supreme, god, who, is, also, known, as, the, first, life, their, names, include, second, third, and, fourth, life, i, e, y, amin, abathur, and, ptahil, 8, the, lord, of, darkness, krun, is, the, ruler, of, the, world, of, darkness, formed, from, dark, waters, representing, chaos, a, main, defender, of, the, darkworld, is, a, giant, monster, or, dragon, with, the, name, ur, and, an, evil, female, ruler, also, inhabits, the, darkworld, known, as, ruha, the, mandaeans, believe, these, malevolent, rulers, created, demonic, offspring, who, consider, themselves, the, owners, of, the, seven, planets, and, twelve, zodiac, constellations, according, to, mandaean, beliefs, the, material, world, is, a, mixture, of, light, and, dark, created, by, ptahil, who, fills, the, role, of, the, demiurge, with, help, from, dark, powers, such, as, ruha, the, seven, and, the, twelve, adam, s, body, believed, to, be, the, first, human, created, by, god, in, abrahamic, tradition, was, fashioned, by, these, dark, beings, however, his, soul, or, mind, was, a, direct, creation, from, the, light, therefore, mandaeans, believe, the, human, soul, is, capable, of, salvation, because, it, originates, from, the, world, of, light, the, soul, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, inner, adam, or, adam, kasia, is, in, dire, need, of, being, rescued, from, the, dark, so, it, may, ascend, into, the, heavenly, realm, of, the, world, of, light, baptisms, are, a, central, theme, in, mandaeism, believed, to, be, necessary, for, the, redemption, of, the, soul, mandaeans, do, not, perform, a, single, baptism, as, in, religions, such, as, christianity, rather, they, view, baptisms, as, a, ritual, act, capable, of, bringing, the, soul, closer, to, salvation, therefore, mandaeans, are, baptized, repeatedly, during, their, lives, mandaeans, consider, john, the, baptist, to, have, been, a, nasoraean, mandaean, 3, john, is, referred, to, as, their, greatest, and, final, teacher, jorunn, j, buckley, and, other, scholars, specializing, in, mandaeism, believe, that, the, mandaeans, originated, about, two, thousand, years, ago, in, the, palestine, israel, region, and, moved, east, due, to, persecution, others, claim, a, southwestern, mesopotamia, origin, however, some, scholars, take, the, view, that, mandaeism, is, older, and, dates, from, pre, christian, times, mandaeans, assert, that, their, religion, predates, judaism, christianity, and, islam, as, a, monotheistic, faith, mandaeans, believe, that, they, descend, directly, from, shem, noah, s, son, 182, and, also, from, john, the, baptist, s, original, disciples, due, to, paraphrases, and, word, for, word, translations, from, the, mandaean, originals, found, in, the, psalms, of, thomas, it, is, now, believed, that, the, pre, manichaean, presence, of, the, mandaean, religion, is, more, than, likely, ix, the, valentinians, embraced, a, mandaean, baptismal, formula, in, their, rituals, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, birger, a, pearson, compares, the, five, seals, of, sethianism, which, he, believes, is, a, reference, to, quintuple, ritual, immersion, in, water, to, mandaean, masbuta, according, to, jorunn, j, buckley, sethian, gnostic, literature, is, related, perhaps, as, a, younger, sibling, to, mandaean, baptism, ideology, in, addition, to, accepting, mandaeism, s, israelite, or, judean, origins, buckley, adds, he, mandaeans, may, well, have, become, the, inventors, of, or, at, least, contributors, to, the, development, of, gnosticism, and, they, produced, the, most, voluminous, gnostic, literature, we, know, in, one, language, influenc, the, development, of, gnostic, and, other, religious, groups, in, late, antiquity, according, to, magris, samaritan, baptist, sects, were, an, offshoot, of, john, the, baptist, one, offshoot, was, in, turn, headed, by, dositheus, simon, magus, and, menander, it, was, in, this, milieu, that, the, idea, emerged, that, the, world, was, created, by, ignorant, angels, their, baptismal, ritual, removed, the, consequences, of, sin, and, led, to, a, regeneration, by, which, natural, death, which, was, caused, by, these, angels, was, overcome, the, samaritan, leaders, were, viewed, as, the, embodiment, of, god, s, power, spirit, or, wisdom, and, as, the, redeemer, and, revealer, of, true, knowledge, the, simonians, were, centered, on, simon, magus, the, magician, baptised, by, philip, and, rebuked, by, peter, in, acts, 8, who, became, in, early, christianity, the, archetypal, false, teacher, the, ascription, by, justin, martyr, irenaeus, and, others, of, a, connection, between, schools, in, their, time, and, the, individual, in, acts, 8, may, be, as, legendary, as, the, stories, attached, to, him, in, various, apocryphal, books, justin, martyr, identifies, menander, of, antioch, as, simon, magus, pupil, according, to, hippolytus, simonianism, is, an, earlier, form, of, the, valentinian, doctrine, the, quqites, were, a, group, who, followed, a, samaritan, iranian, type, of, gnosticism, in, 2nd, century, ad, erbil, and, in, the, vicinity, of, what, is, today, northern, iraq, the, sect, was, named, after, their, founder, quq, known, as, the, potter, the, quqite, ideology, arose, in, edessa, syria, in, the, 2nd, century, the, quqites, stressed, the, hebrew, bible, made, changes, in, the, new, testament, associated, twelve, prophets, with, twelve, apostles, and, held, that, the, latter, corresponded, to, the, same, number, of, gospels, their, beliefs, seem, to, have, been, eclectic, with, elements, of, judaism, christianity, paganism, astrology, and, gnosticism, syrian, egyptian, gnosticism, includes, sethianism, valentinianism, basilideans, thomasine, traditions, and, serpent, gnostics, as, well, as, a, number, of, other, minor, groups, and, writers, hermeticism, is, also, a, western, gnostic, tradition, though, it, differs, in, some, respects, from, these, other, groups, the, syrian, egyptian, school, derives, much, of, its, outlook, from, platonist, influences, it, depicts, creation, in, a, series, of, emanations, from, a, primal, monadic, source, finally, resulting, in, the, creation, of, the, material, universe, these, schools, tend, to, view, evil, in, terms, of, matter, that, is, markedly, inferior, to, goodness, and, lacking, spiritual, insight, and, goodness, rather, than, as, an, equal, force, many, of, these, movements, used, texts, related, to, christianity, with, some, identifying, themselves, as, specifically, christian, though, quite, different, from, the, orthodox, or, roman, catholic, forms, jesus, and, several, of, his, apostles, such, as, thomas, the, apostle, claimed, as, the, founder, of, the, thomasine, form, of, gnosticism, figure, in, many, gnostic, texts, mary, magdalene, is, respected, as, a, gnostic, leader, and, is, considered, superior, to, the, twelve, apostles, by, some, gnostic, texts, such, as, the, gospel, of, mary, john, the, evangelist, is, claimed, as, a, gnostic, by, some, gnostic, interpreters, as, is, even, st, paul, most, of, the, literature, from, this, category, is, known, to, us, through, the, nag, hammadi, library, sethianism, was, one, of, the, main, currents, of, gnosticism, during, the, 2nd, to, 3rd, centuries, and, the, prototype, of, gnosticism, as, condemned, by, irenaeus, sethianism, attributed, its, gnosis, to, seth, third, son, of, adam, and, eve, and, norea, wife, of, noah, who, also, plays, a, role, in, mandeanism, and, manicheanism, their, main, text, is, the, apocryphon, of, john, which, does, not, contain, christian, elements, and, is, an, amalgam, of, two, earlier, myths, earlier, texts, such, as, apocalypse, of, adam, show, signs, of, being, pre, christian, and, focus, on, seth, third, son, of, adam, and, eve, later, sethian, texts, continue, to, interact, with, platonism, sethian, texts, such, as, zostrianos, and, allogenes, draw, on, the, imagery, of, older, sethian, texts, but, use, a, large, fund, of, philosophical, conceptuality, derived, from, contemporary, platonism, that, is, late, middle, platonism, with, no, traces, of, christian, content, according, to, john, d, turner, german, and, american, scholarship, views, sethianism, as, a, distinctly, inner, jewish, albeit, syncretistic, and, heterodox, phenomenon, while, british, and, french, scholarship, tends, to, see, sethianism, as, a, form, of, heterodox, christian, speculation, roelof, van, den, broek, notes, that, sethianism, may, never, have, been, a, separate, religious, movement, and, that, the, term, refers, rather, to, a, set, of, mythological, themes, which, occur, in, various, texts, according, to, smith, sethianism, may, have, begun, as, a, pre, christian, tradition, possibly, a, syncretic, cult, that, incorporated, elements, of, christianity, and, platonism, as, it, grew, according, to, temporini, vogt, and, haase, early, sethians, may, be, identical, to, or, related, to, the, nazarenes, the, ophites, or, the, sectarian, group, called, heretics, by, philo, according, to, turner, sethianism, was, influenced, by, christianity, and, middle, platonism, and, originated, in, the, second, century, as, a, fusion, of, a, jewish, baptizing, group, of, possibly, priestly, lineage, the, so, called, barbeloites, named, after, barbelo, the, first, emanation, of, the, highest, god, and, a, group, of, biblical, exegetes, the, sethites, the, seed, of, seth, at, the, end, of, the, second, century, sethianism, grew, apart, from, the, developing, christian, orthodoxy, which, rejected, the, docetic, view, of, the, sethians, on, christ, in, the, early, third, century, sethianism, was, fully, rejected, by, christian, heresiologists, as, sethianism, shifted, toward, the, contemplative, practices, of, platonism, while, losing, interest, in, their, primal, origins, in, the, late, third, century, sethianism, was, attacked, by, neo, platonists, like, plotinus, and, sethianism, became, alienated, from, platonism, in, the, early, to, mid, fourth, century, sethianism, fragmented, into, various, sectarian, gnostic, groups, such, as, the, archontics, audians, borborites, and, phibionites, and, perhaps, stratiotici, and, secundians, some, of, these, groups, existed, into, the, middle, ages, valentinianism, was, named, after, its, founder, valentinus, c, 100, c, 180, who, was, a, candidate, for, bishop, of, rome, but, started, his, own, group, when, another, was, chosen, valentinianism, flourished, after, mid, second, century, the, school, was, popular, spreading, to, northwest, africa, and, egypt, and, through, to, asia, minor, and, syria, in, the, east, and, valentinus, is, specifically, named, as, gnostikos, by, irenaeus, it, was, an, intellectually, vibrant, tradition, with, an, elaborate, and, philosophically, dense, form, of, gnosticism, valentinus, students, elaborated, on, his, teachings, and, materials, and, several, varieties, of, their, central, myth, are, known, valentinian, gnosticism, may, have, been, monistic, rather, than, dualistic, in, the, valentinian, myths, the, creation, of, a, flawed, materiality, is, not, due, to, any, moral, failing, on, the, part, of, the, demiurge, but, due, to, the, fact, that, he, is, less, perfect, than, the, superior, entities, from, which, he, emanated, valentinians, treat, physical, reality, with, less, contempt, than, other, gnostic, groups, and, conceive, of, materiality, not, as, a, separate, substance, from, the, divine, but, as, attributable, to, an, error, of, perception, which, becomes, symbolized, mythopoetically, as, the, act, of, material, creation, the, followers, of, valentinus, attempted, to, systematically, decode, the, epistles, claiming, that, most, christians, made, the, mistake, of, reading, the, epistles, literally, rather, than, allegorically, valentinians, understood, the, conflict, between, jews, and, gentiles, in, romans, to, be, a, coded, reference, to, the, differences, between, psychics, people, who, are, partly, spiritual, but, have, not, yet, achieved, separation, from, carnality, and, pneumatics, totally, spiritual, people, the, valentinians, argued, that, such, codes, were, intrinsic, in, gnosticism, secrecy, being, important, to, ensuring, proper, progression, to, true, inner, understanding, according, to, bentley, layton, classical, gnosticism, and, the, school, of, thomas, antedated, and, influenced, the, development, of, valentinus, whom, layton, called, the, great, reformer, and, the, focal, point, of, gnostic, development, while, in, alexandria, where, he, was, born, valentinus, probably, would, have, had, contact, with, the, gnostic, teacher, basilides, and, may, have, been, influenced, by, him, simone, petrement, while, arguing, for, a, christian, origin, of, gnosticism, places, valentinus, after, basilides, but, before, the, sethians, according, to, petrement, valentinus, represented, a, moderation, of, the, anti, judaism, of, the, earlier, hellenized, teachers, the, demiurge, widely, regarded, as, a, mythological, depiction, of, the, old, testament, god, of, the, hebrews, i, e, jehova, is, depicted, as, more, ignorant, than, evil, the, basilidians, or, basilideans, were, founded, by, basilides, of, alexandria, in, the, second, century, basilides, claimed, to, have, been, taught, his, doctrines, by, glaucus, a, disciple, of, st, peter, but, could, also, have, been, a, pupil, of, menander, basilidianism, survived, until, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, as, epiphanius, knew, of, basilidians, living, in, the, nile, delta, it, was, however, almost, exclusively, limited, to, egypt, though, according, to, sulpicius, severus, it, seems, to, have, found, an, entrance, into, spain, through, a, certain, mark, from, memphis, st, jerome, states, that, the, priscillianists, were, infected, with, it, the, thomasine, traditions, refers, to, a, group, of, texts, which, are, attributed, to, the, apostle, thomas, karen, l, king, notes, that, thomasine, gnosticism, as, a, separate, category, is, being, criticised, and, may, not, stand, the, test, of, scholarly, scrutiny, marcion, was, a, church, leader, from, sinope, a, city, on, the, south, shore, of, the, black, sea, in, present, day, turkey, who, preached, in, rome, around, 150, ce, but, was, expelled, and, started, his, own, congregation, which, spread, throughout, the, mediterranean, he, rejected, the, old, testament, and, followed, a, limited, christian, canon, which, included, only, a, redacted, version, of, luke, and, ten, edited, letters, of, paul, some, scholars, do, not, consider, him, to, be, a, gnostic, but, his, teachings, clearly, resemble, some, gnostic, teachings, he, preached, a, radical, difference, between, the, god, of, the, old, testament, the, demiurge, the, evil, creator, of, the, material, universe, and, the, highest, god, the, loving, spiritual, god, who, is, the, father, of, jesus, who, had, sent, jesus, to, the, earth, to, free, mankind, from, the, tyranny, of, the, jewish, law, like, the, gnostics, marcion, argued, that, jesus, was, essentially, a, divine, spirit, appearing, to, men, in, the, shape, of, a, human, form, and, not, someone, in, a, true, physical, body, marcion, held, that, the, heavenly, father, the, father, of, jesus, christ, was, an, utterly, alien, god, he, had, no, part, in, making, the, world, nor, any, connection, with, it, hermeticism, is, closely, related, to, gnosticism, but, its, orientation, is, more, positive, the, persian, schools, which, appeared, in, the, western, persian, sasanian, province, of, asoristan, and, whose, writings, were, originally, produced, in, the, eastern, aramaic, dialects, spoken, in, mesopotamia, at, the, time, are, representative, of, what, is, believed, to, be, among, the, oldest, of, the, gnostic, thought, forms, these, movements, are, considered, by, most, to, be, religions,

preach, the, true, message, of, christ, in, 240, 241, mani, travelled, to, the, indo, greek, kingdom, of, the, sakas, in, what, is, now, afghanistan, where, he, studied, hinduism, and, its, various, extant, philosophies, returning, in, 242, he, joined, the, court, of, shapur, i, to, whom, he, dedicated, his, only, work, written, in, persian, known, as, the, shabuhragan, the, original, writings, were, written, in, syriac, an, eastern, aramaic, language, in, a, unique, manichaean, script, manichaeism, conceives, of, two, coexistent, realms, of, light, and, darkness, that, become, embroiled, in, conflict, certain, elements, of, the, light, became, entrapped, within, darkness, and, the, purpose, of, material, creation, is, to, engage, in, the, slow, process, of, extraction, of, these, individual, elements, in, the, end, the, kingdom, of, light, will, prevail, over, darkness, manicheanism, inherits, this, dualistic, mythology, from, zurvanist, zoroastrianism, in, which, the, eternal, spirit, ahura, mazda, is, opposed, by, his, antithesis, angra, mainyu, this, dualistic, teaching, embodied, an, elaborate, cosmological, myth, that, included, the, defeat, of, a, primal, man, by, the, powers, of, darkness, that, devoured, and, imprisoned, the, particles, of, light, according, to, kurt, rudolph, the, decline, of, manichaeism, that, occurred, in, persia, in, the, 5th, century, was, too, late, to, prevent, the, spread, of, the, movement, into, the, east, and, the, west, in, the, west, the, teachings, of, the, school, moved, into, syria, northern, arabia, egypt, and, north, africa, there, is, evidence, for, manicheans, in, rome, and, dalmatia, in, the, 4th, century, and, also, in, gaul, and, spain, from, syria, it, progressed, further, into, syria, palestina, anatolia, and, byzantine, and, persian, armenia, the, influence, of, manicheanism, was, attacked, by, imperial, elects, and, polemical, writings, but, the, religion, remained, prevalent, until, the, 6th, century, and, still, exerted, influence, in, the, emergence, of, paulicianism, bogomilism, and, catharism, in, the, middle, ages, until, it, was, ultimately, stamped, out, by, the, catholic, church, in, the, east, rudolph, relates, manicheanism, was, able, to, bloom, because, the, religious, monopoly, position, previously, held, by, christianity, and, zoroastrianism, had, been, broken, by, nascent, islam, in, the, early, years, of, the, arab, conquest, manicheanism, again, found, followers, in, persia, mostly, amongst, educated, circles, but, flourished, most, in, central, asia, to, which, it, had, spread, through, iran, there, in, 762, manicheanism, became, the, state, religion, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, after, its, decline, in, the, mediterranean, world, gnosticism, lived, on, in, the, periphery, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, resurfaced, in, the, western, world, the, paulicians, an, adoptionist, group, which, flourished, between, 650, and, 872, in, armenia, and, the, eastern, themes, of, the, byzantine, empire, were, accused, by, orthodox, medieval, sources, of, being, gnostic, and, quasi, manichaean, christian, the, bogomils, emerged, in, bulgaria, between, 927, and, 970, and, spread, throughout, europe, it, was, as, synthesis, of, armenian, paulicianism, and, the, bulgarian, orthodox, church, reform, movement, the, cathars, cathari, albigenses, or, albigensians, were, also, accused, by, their, enemies, of, the, traits, of, gnosticism, though, whether, or, not, the, cathari, possessed, direct, historical, influence, from, ancient, gnosticism, is, disputed, if, their, critics, are, reliable, the, basic, conceptions, of, gnostic, cosmology, are, to, be, found, in, cathar, beliefs, most, distinctly, in, their, notion, of, a, lesser, satanic, creator, god, though, they, did, not, apparently, place, any, special, relevance, upon, knowledge, gnosis, as, an, effective, salvific, force, the, quran, like, gnostic, cosmology, makes, a, sharp, distinction, between, this, world, and, the, afterlife, god, is, commonly, thought, of, as, being, beyond, human, comprehension, in, some, islamic, schools, of, thought, god, is, identifiable, with, the, monad, however, according, to, islam, and, unlike, most, gnostic, sects, not, rejection, of, this, world, but, performing, good, deeds, leads, to, paradise, according, to, the, islamic, belief, in, tawhid, unification, of, god, there, was, no, room, for, a, lower, deity, such, as, the, demiurge, according, to, islam, both, good, and, evil, come, from, one, god, a, position, especially, opposed, by, the, manichaeans, ibn, al, muqaffa, a, manichaean, apologist, who, later, converted, to, islam, depicted, the, abrahamic, god, as, a, demonic, entity, who, fights, with, humans, and, boasts, about, his, victories, and, sitting, on, a, throne, from, which, he, can, descend, it, would, be, impossible, that, both, light, and, darkness, were, created, from, one, source, since, they, were, regarded, as, two, different, eternal, principles, muslim, theologists, countered, with, the, example, of, a, repeating, sinner, who, says, i, laid, and, i, repent, this, would, prove, that, good, can, also, result, out, of, evil, islam, also, integrated, traces, of, an, entity, given, authority, over, the, lower, world, in, some, early, writings, iblis, is, regarded, by, some, sufis, as, the, owner, of, this, world, and, humans, must, avoid, the, treasures, of, this, world, since, they, would, belong, to, him, in, the, isma, ili, shi, i, work, umm, al, kitab, azazil, s, role, resembles, whose, of, the, demiurge, like, the, demiurge, he, is, endowed, with, the, ability, to, create, a, world, and, seeks, to, imprison, humans, in, the, material, world, but, here, his, power, is, limited, and, depends, on, the, higher, god, such, anthropogenic, can, be, found, frequently, among, isma, ili, traditions, in, fact, isma, ilism, has, been, often, criticised, as, non, islamic, al, ghazali, characterized, them, as, a, group, who, are, outwardly, shia, but, were, adherents, of, a, dualistic, and, philosophical, religion, further, traces, of, gnostic, ideas, can, be, found, in, sufi, anthropogeny, like, the, gnostic, conception, of, human, beings, imprisoned, in, matter, sufi, traditions, acknowledge, that, the, human, soul, is, an, accomplice, of, the, material, world, and, subject, to, bodily, desires, similar, to, the, way, archontic, spheres, envelop, the, pneuma, the, ruh, pneuma, spirit, must, therefore, gain, victory, over, the, lower, and, material, bound, nafs, psyche, soul, or, anima, to, overcome, its, animal, nature, a, human, being, captured, by, its, animal, desires, mistakenly, claims, autonomy, and, independence, from, the, higher, god, thus, resembling, the, lower, deity, in, classical, gnostic, traditions, however, since, the, goal, is, not, to, abandon, the, created, world, but, just, to, free, oneself, from, lower, desires, it, can, be, disputed, whether, this, can, still, be, gnostic, but, rather, a, completion, of, the, message, of, muhammad, it, seems, that, gnostic, ideas, were, an, influential, part, of, early, islamic, development, but, later, lost, its, influence, however, light, metaphors, and, the, idea, of, unity, of, existence, arabic, romanized, wa, dat, al, wuj, d, still, prevailed, in, later, islamic, thought, such, as, that, of, ibn, sina, gershom, scholem, a, historian, of, jewish, philosophy, wrote, that, several, core, gnostic, ideas, reappear, in, medieval, kabbalah, where, they, are, used, to, reinterpret, earlier, jewish, sources, in, these, cases, according, to, scholem, texts, such, as, the, zohar, adapted, gnostic, precepts, for, the, interpretation, of, the, torah, while, not, using, the, language, of, gnosticism, scholem, further, proposed, that, there, was, a, jewish, gnosticism, which, influenced, the, early, origins, of, christian, gnosticism, given, that, some, of, the, earliest, dated, kabbalistic, texts, emerged, in, medieval, provence, at, which, time, cathar, movements, were, also, supposed, to, have, been, active, scholem, and, other, mid, 20th, century, scholars, argued, that, there, was, mutual, influence, between, the, two, groups, according, to, dan, joseph, this, hypothesis, has, not, been, substantiated, by, any, extant, texts, found, today, in, iraq, iran, and, diaspora, communities, the, mandaeans, are, an, ancient, gnostic, ethnoreligious, group, that, follow, john, the, baptist, and, have, survived, from, antiquity, their, name, comes, from, the, aramaic, manda, meaning, knowledge, or, gnosis, there, are, thought, to, be, 60, 000, to, 70, 000, mandaeans, worldwide, a, number, of, modern, gnostic, ecclesiastical, bodies, have, been, set, up, or, re, founded, since, the, discovery, of, the, nag, hammadi, library, including, the, ecclesia, gnostica, apostolic, johannite, church, ecclesia, gnostica, catholica, the, gnostic, church, of, france, the, thomasine, church, the, alexandrian, gnostic, church, and, the, north, american, college, of, gnostic, bishops, a, number, of, 19th, century, thinkers, such, as, arthur, schopenhauer, albert, pike, and, madame, blavatsky, studied, gnostic, thought, extensively, and, were, influenced, by, it, and, even, figures, like, herman, melville, and, w, b, yeats, were, more, tangentially, influenced, jules, doinel, re, established, a, gnostic, church, in, france, in, 1890, which, altered, its, form, as, it, passed, through, various, direct, successors, fabre, des, essarts, as, tau, syn, sius, and, joanny, bricaud, as, tau, jean, ii, most, notably, and, though, small, is, still, active, today, early, 20th, century, thinkers, who, heavily, studied, and, were, influenced, by, gnosticism, include, carl, jung, who, supported, gnosticism, eric, voegelin, who, opposed, it, jorge, luis, borges, who, included, it, in, many, of, his, short, stories, and, aleister, crowley, with, figures, such, as, hermann, hesse, being, more, moderately, influenced, ren, gu, non, founded, the, gnostic, review, la, gnose, in, 1909, before, moving, to, a, more, perennialist, position, and,

discovery, and, translation, of, the, nag, hammadi, library, after, 1945, has, had, a, huge, effect, on, gnosticism, since, world, war, ii, intellectuals, who, were, heavily, influenced, by, gnosticism, in, this, period, include, lawrence, durrell, hans, jonas, philip, k, dick, and, harold, bloom, with, albert, camus, and, allen, ginsberg, being, more, moderately, influenced, celia,

accordingly, michel, weber, has, proposed, a, gnostic, interpretation, of, his, late, metaphysics, prior, to, the, discovery, of, the, nag, hammadi, library, in, 1945, gnosticism, was, known, primarily, through, the, works, of, heresiologists, church, fathers, who, opposed, those, movements, these, writings, had, an, antagonistic, bias, towards, gnostic, teachings, and, were, incomplete, several, heresiological, writers, such, as, hippolytus, made, little, effort, to, exactly, record, the, nature, of, the, sects, they, reported, on, or, transcribe, their, sacred, texts, reconstructions, of, incomplete, gnostic, texts, were, attempted, in, modern, times, but, research, on, gnosticism, was, coloured, by, the, orthodox, views, of, those, heresiologists, justin, martyr, c, 100, 114, c, 162, 168, wrote, the, first, apology, addressed, to, roman, emperor, antoninus, pius, which, criticised, simon, magus, menander, and, marcion, since, then, both, simon, and, menander, have, been, considered, as, proto, gnostic, irenaeus, died, c, 202, wrote, against, heresies, c, 180, 185, which, identifies, simon, magus, from, flavia, neapolis, in, samaria, as, the, inceptor, of, gnosticism, from, samaria, he, charted, an, apparent, spread, of, the, teachings, of, simon, through, the, ancient, knowers, into, the, teachings, of, valentinus, and, other, contemporary, gnostic, sects, hippolytus, 170, 235, wrote, the, ten, volume, refutation, against, all, heresies, of, which, eight, have, been, unearthed, it, also, focuses, on, the, connection, between, pre, socratic, and, therefore, pre, incantation, of, christ, ideas, and, the, false, beliefs, of, early, gnostic, leaders, thirty, three, of, the, groups, he, reported, on, are, considered, gnostic, by, modern, scholars, including, the, foreigners, and, the, seth, people, hippolytus, further, presents, individual, teachers, such, as, simon, valentinus, secundus, ptolemy, heracleon, marcus, and, colorbasus, tertullian,

marcion, prior, to, the, discovery, at, nag, hammadi, a, limited, number, of, texts, were, available, to, students, of, gnosticism, reconstructions, were, attempted, from, the, records, of, the, heresiologists, but, these, were, necessarily, coloured, by, the, motivation, behind, the, source, accounts, the, nag, hammadi, library, is, a, collection, of, gnostic, texts, discovered, in, 1945, near, nag, hammadi, upper, egypt, twelve, leather, bound, papyrus, codices, buried, in, a, sealed, jar, were, found, by, a, local, farmer, named, muhammed, al, samman, the, writings, in, these, codices, comprised, fifty, two, mostly, gnostic, treatises, but, they, also, include, three, works, belonging, to, the, corpus, hermeticum, and, a, partial, translation, alteration, of, plato, s, republic, these, codices, may, have, belonged, to, a, nearby, pachomian, monastery, and, buried, after, bishop, athanasius, condemned, the, use, of, non, canonical, books, in, his, festal, letter, of, 367, though, the, original, language, of, composition, was, probably, greek, the, various, codices, contained, in, the, collection, were, written, in, coptic, a, 1st, or, 2nd, century, date, of, composition, for, the, lost, greek, originals, has, been, proposed, though, this, is, disputed, the, manuscripts, themselves, date, from, the, 3rd, and, 4th, centuries, the, nag, hammadi, texts, demonstrated, the, fluidity, of, early, christian, scripture, and, early, christianity, itself, prior, to, the, discovery, of, nag, hammadi, the, gnostic, movements, were, largely, perceived, through, the, lens, of, the, early, church, heresiologists, johann, lorenz, von, mosheim, 1694, 1755, proposed, that, gnosticism, developed, on, its, own, in, greece, and, mesopotamia, spreading, to, the, west, and, incorporating, jewish, elements, according, to, mosheim, jewish, thought, took, gnostic, elements, and, used, them, against, greek, philosophy, j, horn, and, ernest, anton, lewald, proposed, persian, and, zoroastrian, origins, while, jacques, matter, described, gnosticism, as, an, intrusion, of, eastern, cosmological, and, theosophical, speculation, into, christianity, in, the, 1880s, gnosticism, was, placed, within, greek, philosophy, especially, neo, platonism, adolf, von, harnack, 1851, 1930, who, belonged, to, the, school, of, the, history, of, dogma, and, proposed, a, kirchengeschichtliches, ursprungsmodell, saw, gnosticism, as, an, internal, development, within, the, church, under, the, influence, of, greek, philosophy, according, to, harnack, gnosticism, was, the, acute, hellenization, of, christianity, the, religionsgeschichtliche, schule, history, of, religions, school, 19th, century, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, study, of, gnosticism, the, religionsgeschichtliche, schule, saw, gnosticism, as, a, pre, christian, phenomenon, and, christian, gnosis, as, only, one, and, even, marginal, instance, of, this, phenomenon, according, to, wilhelm, bousset, 1865, 1920, gnosticism, was, a, form, of, iranian, and, mesopotamian, syncretism, and, eduard, norden, 1868, 1941, also, proposed, pre, christian, origins, while, richard, august, reitzenstein, 1861, 1931, and, rudolf, bultmann, 1884, 1976, also, situated, the, origins, of, gnosticism, in, persia, hans, heinrich, schaeder, 1896, 1957, and, hans, leisegang, 1890, 1951, saw, gnosticism, as, an, amalgam, of, eastern, thought, in, a, greek, form, hans, jonas, 1903, 1993, took, an, intermediate, approach, using, both, the, comparative, approach, of, the, religionsgeschichtliche, schule, and, existentialist, hermeneutics, that, predated, rudolph, bultmann, s, demythologization, procedure, 94, 95, jonas, emphasized, the, duality, between, the, gnostic, god, and, the, world, and, concluded, that, gnosticism, cannot, be, derived, from, platonism, nor, judaism, instead, he, proposed, that, gnosticism, manifested, an, existential, situation, triggered, by, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, and, their, impact, over, greek, city, states, and, oriental, casts, of, priests, intellectuals, 107, 108, by, contrast, contemporary, scholarship, largely, agrees, that, gnosticism, has, jewish, or, judeo, christian, origins, this, theses, is, most, notably, put, forward, by, gershom, g, scholem, 1897, 1982, and, gilles, quispel, 1916, 2006, the, study, of, gnosticism, and, of, early, alexandrian, christianity, received, a, strong, impetus, from, the, discovery, of, the, coptic, nag, hammadi, library, in, 1945, a, great, number, of, translations, have, been, published, and, the, works, of, elaine, pagels, professor, of, religion, at, princeton, university, especially, the, gnostic, gospels, which, detailed, the, suppression, of, some, of, the, writings, found, at, nag, hammadi, by, early, bishops, of, the, christian, church, have, popularized, gnosticism, in, mainstream, culture, but, also, incited, strong, responses, and, condemnations, from, clergical, writers, according, to, matthew, j, dillon, six, trends, can, be, discerned, in, the, definitions, of, gnosticism, the, 1966, messina, conference, on, the, origins, of, gnosis, and, gnosticism, proposed, to, designate, a, particular, group, of, systems, of, the, second, century, after, christ, as, gnosticism, and, to, use, gnosis, to, define, a, conception, of, knowledge, that, transcends, the, times, which, was, described, as, knowledge, of, divine, mysteries, for, an, lite, this, definition, has, now, been, abandoned, it, created, a, religion, gnosticism, from, the, gnosis, which, was, a, widespread, element, of, ancient, religions, suggesting, a, homogeneous, conception, of, gnosis, by, these, gnostic, religions, which, did, not, exist, at, the, time, according, to, dillon, the, texts, from, nag, hammadi, made, clear, that, this, definition, was, limited, and, that, they, are, better, classified, by, movements, such, as, valentinian, mythological, similarity, sethian, or, similar, tropes, presence, of, a, demiurge, dillon, further, notes, that, the, messian, definition, also, excluded, pre, christian, gnosticism, and, later, developments, such, as, the, mandaeans, and, the, manichaeans, hans, jonas, discerned, two, main, currents, of, gnosticism, namely, syrian, egyptian, and, persian, which, includes, manicheanism, and, mandaeism, among, the, syrian, egyptian, schools, and, the, movements, they, spawned, are, a, typically, more, monist, view, persian, gnosticism, possesses, more, dualist, tendencies, reflecting, a, strong, influence, from, the, beliefs, of, the, persian, zurvanist, zoroastrians, those, of, the, medieval, cathars, bogomils, and, carpocratians, seem, to, include, elements, of, both, categories, however, scholars, such, as, kurt, rudolph, mark, lidzbarski, rudolf, mac, ch, ethel, s, drower, and, jorunn, jacobsen, buckley, argue, for, a, palestinian, origin, for, mandaeism, gilles, quispel, divided, syrian, egyptian, gnosticism, further, into, jewish, gnosticism, the, apocryphon, of, john, and, christian, gnosis, marcion, basilides, valentinus, this, christian, gnosticism, was, christocentric, and, influenced, by, christian, writings, such, as, the, gospel, of, john, and, the, pauline, epistles, other, authors, speak, rather, of, gnostic, christians, noting, that, gnostics, were, a, prominent, substream, in, the, early, church, the, best, known, example, of, this, approach, is, adolf, von, harnack, 1851, 1930, who, stated, that, gnosticism, is, the, acute, hellenization, of, christianity, according, to, dillon, many, scholars, today, continue, in, the, vein, of, harnack, in, reading, gnosticism, as, a, late, and, contaminated, version, of, christianity, notably, darrell, block, who, criticises, elaine, pagels, for, her, view, that, early, christianity, was, wildly, diverse, hans, jonas, 1903, 1993, took, an, existential, phenomenological, approach, to, gnosticism, according, to, jonas, alienation, is, a, distinguishing, characteristic, of, gnosticism, making, it, different, from, contemporary, religions, jonas, compares, this, alienation, with, the, existentialist, notion, of, geworfenheit, martin, heidegger, s, thrownness, as, in, being, thrown, into, a, hostile, world, in, the, late, 1980s, scholars, voiced, concerns, about, the, broadness, of, gnosticism, as, a, meaningful, category, bentley, layton, proposed, to, categorize, gnosticism, by, delineating, which, groups, were, marked, as, gnostic, in, ancient, texts, according, to, layton, this, term, was, mainly, applied, by, heresiologists, to, the, myth, described, in, the, apocryphon, of, john, and, was, used, mainly, by, the, sethians, and, the, ophites, according, to, layton, texts, which, refer, to, this, myth, can, be, called, classical, gnostic, in, addition, alastair, logan, uses, social, theory, to, identify, gnosticism, he, uses, rodney, stark, and, william, bainbridge, s, sociological, theory, on, traditional, religion, sects, and, cults, according, to, logan, the, gnostics, were, a, cult, at, odds, with, the, society, at, large, according, to, the, westar, institute, s, fall, 2014, christianity, seminar, report, on, gnosticism, there, is, no, group, that, possesses, all, of, the, usually, attributed, features, nearly, every, group, possesses, one, or, more, of, them, or, some, modified, version, of, them, there, was, no, particular, relationship, among, any, set, of, groups, which, one, could, distinguish, as, gnostic, as, if, they, were, in, opposition, to, some, other, set, of, groups, for, instance, every, sect, of, christianity, on, which, we, have, any, information, on, this, point, believed, in, a, separate, logos, who, created, the, universe, at, god, s, behest, likewise, they, believed, some, kind, of, secret, knowledge, gnosis, was, essential, to, ensuring, one, s, salvation, likewise, they, had, a, dualist, view, of, the, cosmos, in, which, the, lower, world, was, corrupted, by, meddling, divine, beings, and, the, upper, world, s, god, was, awaiting, a, chance, to, destroy, it, and, start, over, thereby, helping, humanity, to, escape, its, corrupt, bodies, and, locations, by, fleeing, into, celestial, ones, according, to, michael, allen, williams, the, concept, of, gnosticism, as, a, distinct, religious, tradition, is, questionable, since, gnosis, was, a, pervasive, characteristic, of, many, religious, traditions, in, antiquity, and, not, restricted, to, the, so, called, gnostic, systems, according, to, williams, the, conceptual, foundations, on, which, the, category, of, gnosticism, rests, are, the, remains, of, the, agenda, of, the, heresiologists, the, early, church, heresiologists, created, an, interpretive, definition, of, gnosticism, and, modern, scholarship, followed, this, example, and, created, a, categorical, definition, according, to, williams, the, term, needs, replacing, to, more, accurately, reflect, those, movements, it, comprises, and, suggests, to, replace, it, with, the, term, the, biblical, demiurgical, tradition, according, to, karen, king, scholars, have, unwittingly, continued, the, project, of, ancient, heresiologists, searching, for, non, christian, influences, thereby, continuing, to, portray, a, pure, original, christianity, in, light, of, such, increasing, scholarly, rejection, and, restriction, of, the, concept, of, gnosticism, david, g, robertson, has, written, on, the, distortions, which, misapplications, of, the, term, continue, to, perpetuate, in, religious, studies, carl,
