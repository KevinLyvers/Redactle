of, supplication, or, intercession, directed, towards, a, deity, or, a, deified, ancestor, more, generally, prayer, can, also, have, the, purpose, of, thanksgiving, or, praise, and, in, comparative, religion, is, closely, associated, with, more, abstract, forms, of, meditation, and, with, charms, or, spells, prayer, can, take, a, variety, of, forms, it, can, be, part, of, a, set, liturgy, or, ritual, and, it, can, be, performed, alone, or, in, groups, prayer, may, take, the, form, of, a, hymn, incantation, formal, creedal, statement, or, a, spontaneous, utterance, in, the, praying, person, the, act, of, prayer, is, attested, in, written, sources, as, early, as, five, thousand, years, ago, today, most, major, religions, involve, prayer, in, one, way, or, another, some, ritualize, the, act, requiring, a, strict, sequence, of, actions, or, placing, a, restriction, on, who, is, permitted, to, pray, while, others, teach, that, prayer, may, be, practised, spontaneously, by, anyone, at, any, time, scientific, studies, regarding, the, use, of, prayer, have, mostly, concentrated, on, its, effect, on, the, healing, of, sick, or, injured, people, the, efficacy, of, prayer, in, faith, healing, has, been, evaluated, in, numerous, studies, with, contradictory, results, the, english, term, prayer, is, from, medieval, latin, precaria, lit, petition, prayer, the, vulgate, latin, is, oratio, which, translates, greek, in, turn, the, septuagint, translation, of, biblical, hebrew, t, phillah, various, spiritual, traditions, offer, a, wide, variety, of, devotional, acts, there, are, morning, and, evening, prayers, graces, said, over, meals, and, reverent, physical, gestures, some, christians, bow, their, heads, and, fold, their, hands, some, native, americans, regard, dancing,

whirl, quakers, often, keep, silent, some, pray, according, to, standardized, rituals, and, liturgies, while, others, prefer, extemporaneous, prayers, others, combine, the, two, christian, circles, often, look, to, friedrich, heiler, 1892, 1967, whose, systematic, typology, of, prayer, lists, six, types, of, prayer, primitive, ritual, greek, cultural, philosophical, mystical, and, prophetic, some, forms, of, prayer, require, a, prior, ritualistic, form, of, cleansing, or, purification, such, as, in, ghusl, and, wudhu, prayer, may, occur, privately, and, individually, sometimes, called, affective, prayer, or, collectively, shared, by, or, led, on, behalf, of, fellow, believers, of, either, a, specific, faith, tradition, or, a, broader, grouping, of, people, prayer, can, be, incorporated, into, a, daily, thought, life, in, which, one, is, in, constant, communication, with, a, god, some, people, pray, throughout, all, that, is, happening, during, the, day, and, seek, guidance, as, the, day, progresses, this, is, actually, regarded, as, a, requirement, in, several, christian, denominations, although, enforcement, is, neither, possible, nor, desirable, there, can, be, many, different, answers, to, prayer, just, as, there, are, many, ways, to, interpret, an, answer, to, a, question, if, there, in, fact, comes, an, answer, some, may, experience, audible, physical, or, mental, epiphanies, if, indeed, an, answer, comes, the, time, and, place, it, comes, is, considered, random, some, traditions, distinguish, between, contemplative, and, meditative, prayer, outward, acts, that, may, accompany, prayer, include, anointing, with, oil, ringing, a, bell, burning, incense, or, paper, lighting, a, candle, or, candles, facing, a, specific, direction, e, g, towards, mecca, or, the, east, and, making, the, sign, of, the, cross, one, less, noticeable, act, related, to, prayer, is, fasting, a, variety, of, body, postures, may, be, assumed, often, with, specific, meaning, mainly, respect, or, adoration, associated, with, them, standing, sitting, kneeling, prostrate, on, the, floor, eyes, opened, eyes, closed, hands, folded, or, clasped, hands, upraised, holding, hands, with, others, a, laying, on, of, hands, and, others, prayers, may, be, recited, from, memory, read, from, a, book, of, prayers, or, composed, spontaneously, or, impromptu, they, may, be, said, chanted, or, sung, they, may, or, may, not, have, a, musical, accompaniment, there, may, be, a, time, of, outward, silence, while, prayers, are, offered, mentally, often, there, are, prayers, to, fit, specific, occasions, such, as, the, blessing, of, a, meal, the, birth, or, death, of, a, loved, one, other, significant, events, in, the, life, of, a, believer, or, days, of, the, year, that, have, special, religious, significance, details, corresponding, to, specific, traditions, are, outlined, below, anthropologically, the, concept, of, prayer, is, closely, related, to, that, of, surrender, and, supplication, the, traditional, posture, of, prayer, in, medieval, europe, is, kneeling, or, supine, with, clasped, hands, in, antiquity, more, typically, with, raised, hands, the, early, christian, prayer, posture, was, standing, looking, up, to, heaven, with, outspread, arms, and, bare, head, this, is, the, pre, christian, pagan, prayer, posture, except, for, the, bare, head, which, was, prescribed, for, males, in, i, corinthians, 11, 4, in, roman, paganism, the, head, had, to, be, covered, in, prayer, certain, cretan, and, cypriote, figures, of, the, late, bronze, age, with, arms, raised, have, been, interpreted, as, worshippers, their, posture, is, similar, to, the, flight, posture, a, crouching, posture, with, raised, hands, related, to, the, universal, hands, up, gesture, of, surrender, the, kneeling, posture, with, clasped, hands, appears, to, have, been, introduced, only, with, the, beginning, high, medieval, period, presumably, adopted, from, a, gesture, of, feudal, homage, although, prayer, in, its, literal, sense, is, not, used, in, animism, communication, with, the, spirit, world, is, vital, to, the, animist, way, of, life, this, is, usually, accomplished, through, a, shaman, who, through, a, trance, gains, access, to, the, spirit, world, and, then, shows, the, spirits, thoughts, to, the, people, other, ways, to, receive, messages, from, the, spirits, include, using, astrology, or, contemplating, fortune, tellers, and, healers, some, of, the, oldest, extant, literature, such, as, the, kesh, temple, hymn, c, 26th, century, bc, is, liturgy, addressed, to, deities, and, thus, technically, prayer, the, egyptian, pyramid, texts, of, about, the, same, period, similarly, contain, spells, or, incantations, addressed, to, the, gods, in, the, loosest, sense, in, the, form, of, magical, thinking, combined, with, animism, prayer, has, been, argued, as, representing, a, human, cultural, universal, which, would, have, been, present, since, the, emergence, of, behavioral, modernity, by, anthropologists, such, as, sir, edward, burnett, tylor, and, sir, james, george, frazer, reliable, records, are, available, for, the, polytheistic, religions, of, the, iron, age, most, notably, ancient, greek, religion, which, strongly, influenced, roman, religion, these, religious, traditions, were, direct, developments, of, the, earlier, bronze, age, religions, ceremonial, prayer, was, highly, formulaic, and, ritualized, in, ancient, polytheism, ancestor, worship, is, indistinguishable, from, theistic, worship, see, also, euhemerism, vestiges, of, ancestor, worship, persist, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, in, modern, religious, traditions, throughout, the, world, most, notably, in, japanese, shinto, vietnamese, folk, religion, and, chinese, folk, religion, the, practices, involved, in, shinto, prayer, are, heavily, influenced, by, buddhism, japanese, buddhism, has, also, been, strongly, influenced, by, shinto, in, turn, shinto, prayers, quite, frequently, consist, of, wishes, or, favors, asked, of, the, kami, rather, than, lengthy, praises, or, devotions, the, practice, of, votive, offering, is, universal, and, is, attested, at, least, since, the, bronze, age, in, shinto, this, takes, the, form, of, a, small, wooden, tablet, called, an, ema, prayers, in, etruscan, were, used, in, the, roman, world, by, augurs, and, other, oracles, long, after, etruscan, became, a, dead, language, the, carmen, arvale, and, the, carmen, saliare, are, two, specimens, of, partially, preserved, prayers, that, seem, to, have, been, unintelligible, to, their, scribes, and, whose, language, is, full, of, archaisms, and, difficult, passages, roman, prayers, and, sacrifices, were, envisioned, as, legal, bargains, between, deity, and, worshipper, the, roman, principle, was, expressed, as, do, ut, des, i, give, so, that, you, may, give, cato, the, elder, s, treatise, on, agriculture, contains, many, examples, of, preserved, traditional, prayers, in, one, a, farmer, addresses, the, unknown, deity, of, a, possibly, sacred, grove, and, sacrifices, a, pig, in, order, to, placate, the, god, or, goddess, of, the, place, and, beseech, his, or, her, permission, to, cut, down, some, trees, from, the, grove, celtic, germanic, and, slavic, religions, are, recorded, much, later, and, much, more, fragmentarily, than, the, religions, of, classical, antiquity, they, nevertheless, show, substantial, parallels, to, the, better, attested, religions, of, the, iron, age, in, the, case, of, germanic, religion, the, practice, of, prayer, is, reliably, attested, but, no, actual, liturgy, is, recorded, from, the, early, roman, era, period, an, old, norse, prayer, is, on, record, in, the, form, of, a, dramatization, in, skaldic, poetry, this, prayer, is, recorded, in, stanzas, 2, and, 3, of, the, poem, sigrdr, fum, l, compiled, in, the, 13th, century, poetic, edda, from, earlier, traditional, sources, where, the, valkyrie, sigrdr, fa, prays, to, the, gods, and, the, earth, after, being, woken, by, the, hero, sigurd, a, prayer, to, odin, is, mentioned, in, chapter, 2, of, the, v, lsunga, saga, where, king, rerir, prays, for, a, child, in, stanza, 9, of, the, poem, oddr, nargr, tr, a, prayer, is, made, to, kind, wights, frigg, and, freyja, and, many, gods, in, chapter, 21, of, j, msv, kinga, saga, wishing, to, turn, the, tide, of, the, battle, of, hj, rungav, gr, haakon, sigurdsson, eventually, finds, his, prayers, answered, by, the, goddesses, orger, r, h, lgabr, r, and, irpa, folk, religion, in, the, medieval, period, produced, syncretisms, between, pre, christian, and, christian, traditions, an, example, is, the, 11th, century, anglo, saxon, charm, cerbot, for, the, fertility, of, crops, and, land, or, the, medical, wi, f, rstice, the, 8th, century, wessobrunn, prayer, has, been, proposed, as, a, christianized, pagan, prayer, and, compared, to, the, pagan, v, lusp, and, the, merseburg, incantations, the, latter, recorded, in, the, 9th, or, 10th, century, but, of, much, older, traditional, origins, in, australian, aboriginal, mythology, prayers, to, the, great, wit, are, performed, by, the, clever, men, and, clever, women, or, kadji, these, aboriginal, shamans, use, maban, or, mabain, the, material, that, is, believed, to, give, them, their, powers, the, pueblo, indians, are, known, to, have, used, prayer, sticks, that, is, sticks, with, feathers, attached, as, supplicatory, offerings, the, hopi, indians, used, prayer, sticks, as, well, but, they, attached, to, it, a, small, bag, of, sacred, meal, there, are, different, forms, of, prayer, one, of, them, is, to, directly, appeal, to, a, deity, to, grant, one, s, requests, some, have, termed, this, as, the, social, approach, to, prayer, atheist, arguments, against, prayer, are, mostly, directed, against, petitionary, prayer, in, particular, daniel, dennett, argued, that, petitionary, prayer, might, have, the, undesirable, psychological, effect, of, relieving, a, person, of, the, need, to, take, active, measures, this, potential, drawback, manifests, in, extreme, forms, in, such, cases, as, christian, scientists, who, rely, on, prayers, instead, of, seeking, medical, treatment, for, family, members, for, easily, curable, conditions, which, later, result, in, death, christopher, hitchens, 2012, argued, that, praying, to, a, god, which, is, omnipotent, and, all, knowing, would, be, presumptuous, for, example, he, interprets, ambrose, bierce, s, definition, of, prayer, by, stating, that, the, man, who, prays, is, the, one, who, thinks, that, god, has, arranged, matters, all, wrong, but, who, also, thinks, that, he, can, instruct, god, how, to, put, them, right, in, this, view, prayer, is, not, a, conversation, rather, it, is, meant, to, inculcate, certain, attitudes, in, the, one, who, prays, but, not, to, influence, among, jews, this, has, been, the, approach, of, rabbenu, bachya, rabbi, yehuda, halevi, joseph, albo, samson, raphael, hirsch, and, joseph, b, soloveitchik, this, view, is, expressed, by, rabbi, nosson, scherman, in, the, overview, to, the, artscroll, siddur, p, xiii, among, christian, theologians, e, m, bounds, stated, the, educational, purpose, of, prayer, in, every, chapter, of, his, book, the, necessity, of, prayer, prayer, books, such, as, the, book, of, common, prayer, are, both, a, result, of, this, approach, and, an, exhortation, to, keep, it, in, this, view, the, ultimate, goal, of, prayer, is, to, help, train, a, person, to, focus, on, divinity, through, philosophy, and, intellectual, contemplation, meditation, this, approach, was, taken, by, the, jewish, scholar, and, philosopher, maimonides, and, the, other, medieval, rationalists, it, became, popular, in, jewish, christian, and, islamic, intellectual, circles, but, never, became, the, most, popular, understanding, of, prayer, among, the, laity, in, any, of, these, faiths, in, all, three, of, these, faiths, today, a, significant, minority, of, people, still, hold, to, this, approach, in, a, rationalist, approach, praying, encompasses, three, aspects, first, logos, as, the, idea, of, the, sender, secondly, rhemata, as, the, words, to, express, the, idea, and, thirdly, rhemata, and, logos, to, where, the, idea, is, sent, e, g, to, god, allah, thus, praying, is, not, a, conversation, with, god, or, jesus, but, a, one, way, direction, to, the, divine, among, the, abrahamic, religions, islam, orthodox, christianity, and, hasidic, judaism, are, likely, most, adhering, to, this, concept, also, because, it, does, not, allow, secondary, mythologies, and, has, taken, its, spiritual, roots, from, hellenistic, philosophy, particularly, from, aristotle, similarly, in, hinduism, the, different, divinities, are, manifestations, of, one, god, with, associated, prayers, however, many, indians, particularly, hindus, believe, that, god, can, be, manifest, in, people, including, in, people, of, lower, castes, such, as, sadhus, in, this, approach, the, purpose, of, prayer, is, to, enable, the, person, praying, to, gain, a, direct, experience, of, the, recipient, of, the, prayer, or, as, close, to, direct, as, a, specific, theology, permits, this, approach, is, very, significant, in, christianity, and, widespread, in, judaism, although, less, popular, theologically, in, eastern, orthodoxy, this, approach, is, known, as, hesychasm, it, is, also, widespread, in, sufi, islam, and, in, some, forms, of, mysticism, it, has, some, similarities, with, the, rationalist, approach, since, it, can, also, involve, contemplation, although, the, contemplation, is, not, generally, viewed, as, being, as, rational, or, intellectual, christian, and, roman, catholic, traditions, also, include, an, experiential, approach, to, prayer, within, the, practice, of, lectio, divina, historically, a, benedictine, practice, lectio, divina, involves, the, following, steps, a, short, scripture, passage, is, read, aloud, the, passage, is, meditated, upon, using, the, mind, to, place, the, listener, within, a, relationship, or, dialogue, with, the, text, recitation, of, a, prayer, and, concludes, with, contemplation, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, describes, prayer, and, meditation, as, follows, meditation, engages, thought, imagination, emotion, and, desire, this, mobilization, of, faculties, is, necessary, in, order, to, deepen, our, convictions, of, faith, prompt, the, conversion, of, our, heart, and, strengthen, our, will, to, follow, christ, christian, prayer, tries, above, all, to, meditate, on, the, mysteries, of, christ, as, in, lectio, divina, or, the, rosary, this, form, of, prayerful, reflection, is, of, great, value, but, christian, prayer, should, go, further, to, the, knowledge, of, the, love, of, the, lord, jesus, to, union, with, him, the, experience, of, god, within, christian, mysticism, has, been, contrasted, with, the, concept, of, experiential, religion, or, mystical, experience, because, of, a, long, history, or, authors, living, and, writing, about, experience, with, the, divine, in, a, manner, that, identifies, god, as, unknowable, and, ineffable, the, language, of, such, ideas, could, be, characterized, paradoxically, as, experiential, as, well, as, without, the, phenomena, of, experience, the, notion, of, religious, experience, can, be, traced, back, to, william, james, who, used, a, term, called, religious, experience, in, his, book, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, the, origins, of, the, use, of, this, term, can, be, dated, further, back, in, the, 18th, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, several, historical, figures, put, forth, very, influential, views, that, religion, and, its, beliefs, can, be, grounded, in, experience, itself, while, kant, held, that, moral, experience, justified, religious, beliefs, john, wesley, in, addition, to, stressing, individual, moral, exertion, thought, that, the, religious, experiences, in, the, methodist, movement, paralleling, the, romantic, movement, were, foundational, to, religious, commitment, as, a, way, of, life, according, to, catholic, doctrine, methodists, lack, a, ritualistic, and, rational, approach, to, praying, but, rely, on, individualistic, and, moralistic, forms, of, worship, in, direct, conversation, with, god, this, approach, is, rejected, by, most, orthodox, religions, wayne, proudfoot, traces, the, roots, of, the, notion, of, religious, experience, to, the, german, theologian, friedrich, schleiermacher, 1768, 1834, who, argued, that, religion, is, based, on, a, feeling, of, the, infinite, the, notion, of, religious, experience, was, used, by, schleiermacher, and, albert, ritschl, to, defend, religion, against, the, growing, scientific, and, secular, critique, and, defend, the, view, that, human, moral, and, religious, experience, justifies, religious, beliefs, such, religious, empiricism, would, be, later, seen, as, highly, problematic, and, was, during, the, period, in, between, world, wars, famously, rejected, by, karl, barth, in, the, 20th, century, religious, as, well, as, moral, experience, as, justification, for, religious, beliefs, still, holds, sway, some, influential, modern, scholars, holding, this, liberal, theological, view, are, charles, raven, and, the, oxford, physicist, theologian, charles, coulson, the, notion, of, religious, experience, was, adopted, by, many, scholars, of, religion, of, whom, william, james, was, the, most, influential, the, notion, of, experience, has, been, criticised, robert, sharf, points, out, that, experience, is, a, typical, western, term, which, has, found, its, way, into, asian, religiosity, via, western, influences, the, notion, of, experience, introduces, a, false, notion, of, duality, between, experiencer, and, experienced, whereas, the, essence, of, kensho, is, the, realisation, of, the, non, duality, of, observer, and, observed, pure, experience, does, not, exist, all, experience, is, mediated, by, intellectual, and, cognitive, activity, the, specific, teachings, and, practices, of, a, specific, tradition, may, even, determine, what, experience, someone, has, which, means, that, this, experience, is, not, the, proof, of, the, teaching, but, a, result, of, the, teaching, a, pure, consciousness, without, concepts, reached, by, cleaning, the, doors, of, perception, would, be, an, overwhelming, chaos, of, sensory, input, without, coherence, in, the, hebrew, bible, prayer, is, an, evolving, means, of, interacting, with, god, most, frequently, through, a, spontaneous, individual, unorganized, form, of, petitioning, and, or, thanking, standardized, prayer, such, as, is, done, today, is, non, existent, although, beginning, in, deuteronomy, the, bible, lays, the, groundwork, for, organized, prayer, including, basic, liturgical, guidelines, and, by, the, bible, s, later, books, prayer, has, evolved, to, a, more, standardized, form, although, still, radically, different, from, the, form, practiced, by, modern, jews, individual, prayer, is, described, by, the, tanakh, two, ways, the, first, of, these, is, when, prayer, is, described, as, occurring, and, a, result, is, achieved, but, no, further, information, regarding, a, person, s, prayer, is, given, in, these, instances, such, as, with, isaac, moses, samuel, and, job, the, act, of, praying, is, a, method, of, changing, a, situation, for, the, better, the, second, way, in, which, prayer, is, depicted, is, through, fully, fleshed, out, episodes, of, prayer, where, a, person, s, prayer, is, related, in, full, many, famous, biblical, personalities, have, such, a, prayer, including, every, major, character, from, hannah, to, hezekiah, in, the, new, testament, prayer, is, presented, as, a, positive, command, the, people, of, god, are, challenged, to, include, christian, prayer, in, their, everyday, life, even, in, the, busy, struggles, of, marriage, as, it, brings, people, closer, to, god, jesus, encouraged, his, disciples, to, pray, in, secret, in, their, private, rooms, using, the, lord, s, prayer, as, a, humble, response, to, the, prayer, of, the, pharisees, whose, practices, in, prayer, were, regarded, as, impious, by, the, new, testament, writers, for, evangelists, and, other, christian, sects, prayer, is, shown, to, be, god, s, appointed, method, by, which, we, obtain, what, he, has, to, bestow, further, the, book, of, james, says, that, the, lack, of, blessings, in, life, results, from, a, failure, to, pray, jesus, healed, through, prayer, and, expected, his, followers, to, do, so, also, the, apostle, paul, wrote, to, the, churches, of, thessalonica, to, pray, continually, observant, jews, pray, three, times, a, day, shacharit, mincha, and, ma, ariv, with, lengthier, prayers, on, special, days, such, as, the, shabbat, and, jewish, holidays, including, musaf, and, the, reading, of, the, torah, the, siddur, is, the, prayerbook, used, by, jews, all, over, the, world, containing, a, set, order, of, daily, prayers, jewish, prayer, is, usually, described, as, having, two, aspects, kavanah, intention, and, keva, the, ritualistic, structured, elements, the, most, important, jewish, prayers, are, the, shema, yisrael, hear, o, israel, and, the, amidah, the, standing, prayer, communal, prayer, is, preferred, over, solitary, prayer, and, a, quorum, of, ten, adult, males, a, minyan, is, considered, by, orthodox, judaism, a, prerequisite, for, several, communal, prayers, there, are, also, many, other, ritualistic, prayers, a, jew, performs, during, their, day, such, as, washing, before, eating, bread, washing, after, one, wakes, up, in, the, morning, and, doing, grace, after, meals, in, this, view, the, ultimate, goal, of, prayer, is, to, help, train, a, person, to, focus, on, divinity, through, philosophy, and, intellectual, contemplation, this, approach, was, taken, by, maimonides, and, the, other, medieval, rationalists, one, example, of, this, approach, to, prayer, is, noted, by, rabbi, steven, weil, who, was, appointed, the, orthodox, union, s, executive, vice, president, in, 2009, he, notes, that, the, word, prayer, is, a, derivative, of, the, latin, precari, which, means, to, beg, the, hebrew, equivalent, tefilah, however, along, with, its, root, pelel, or, its, reflexive, l, hitpallel, means, the, act, of, self, analysis, or, self, evaluation, this, approach, is, sometimes, described, as, the, person, praying, having, a, dialogue, or, conversation, with, god, in, this, view, prayer, is, not, a, conversation, rather, it, is, meant, to, inculcate, certain, attitudes, in, the, one, who, prays, but, not, to, influence, this, has, been, the, approach, of, rabbenu, bachya, yehuda, halevy, joseph, albo, samson, raphael, hirsch, and, joseph, dov, soloveitchik, this, view, is, expressed, by, rabbi, nosson, scherman, in, the, overview, to, the, artscroll, siddur, p, xiii, note, that, scherman, goes, on, to, also, affirm, the, kabbalistic, view, see, below, kabbalah, uses, a, series, of, kavanot, directions, of, intent, to, specify, the, path, the, prayer, ascends, in, the, dialog, with, god, to, increase, its, chances, of, being, answered, favorably, kabbalists, ascribe, a, higher, meaning, to, the, purpose, of, prayer, which, is, no, less, than, affecting, the, very, fabric, of, reality, itself, restructuring, and, repairing, the, universe, in, a, real, fashion, in, this, view, every, word, of, every, prayer, and, indeed, even, every, letter, of, every, word, has, a, precise, meaning, and, a, precise, effect, prayers, thus, literally, affect, the, mystical, forces, of, the, universe, and, repair, the, fabric, of, creation, among, jews, this, approach, has, been, taken, by, the, chassidei, ashkenaz, german, pietists, of,

that, the, languages, they, speak, in, prayer, are, real, foreign, languages, and, that, the, ability, to, speak, those, languages, spontaneously, is, a, gift, of, the, holy, spirit, some, people, outside, of, the, movement, however, have, offered, dissenting, views, george, barton, cutten, suggested, that, glossolalia, was, a, sign, of, mental, illness, felicitas, goodman, suggested, that,

invocation, of, a, bodhisattva, called, ma, ipadma, however, from, an, early, time, these, mantras, were, interpreted, in, the, context, of, mystical, sound, symbolism, the, most, extreme, example, of, this, is, the, om, syllable, which, as, early, as, in, the, aitareya, brahmana, was, claimed, as, equivalent, to, the, entire, vedas, collection, of, ritual, hymns, in, the, earliest, buddhist,

deities, but, the, peak, view, of, the, tradition, is, that, the, deities, or, yidam, are, no, more, existent, or, real, than, the, continuity, sanskrit, santana, refer, mindstream, of, the,

extolling, a, single, supreme, force, brahman, that, is, made, manifest, in, several, lower, forms, as, the, familiar, gods, of, the, hindu, pantheon, hindus, in, india, have, numerous, devotional, movements, hindus, may, pray, to, the, highest, absolute, god, brahman, or, more, commonly, to, its, three, manifestations, a, creator, god, called, brahma, a, preserver, god, called, vishnu, and, a, destroyer, god, so, that, the, creation, cycle, can, start, afresh, shiva, and, at, the, next, level, to, vishnu, s, avatars, earthly, appearances, rama, and, krishna, or, to, many, other, male, or,

scripture, reading, recitation, kirtan, hymn, singing, program, or, any, other, religious, program, in, sikhism, these, prayers, are, also, said, before, and, after, eating, the, prayer, is, a, plea, to, god, to, support, and, help, the, devotee, with, whatever, he, or, she, is, about, to, undertake, or, has, done, the, ardas, is, usually, always, done, standing, up, with, folded, hands, the, beginning, of, the, ardas, is, strictly, set, by, the, tenth, sikh, guru, guru, gobind, singh, when, it, comes, to, conclusion, of, this, prayer, the, devotee, uses, words, like, waheguru, please, bless, me, in, the, task, that, i, am, about, to, undertake, when, starting, a, new, task, or, akal, purakh, having, completed, the, hymn, singing, we, ask, for, your, continued, blessings, so, that, we, can, continue, with, your, memory, and, remember, you, at, all, times, etc, the, word, ard, s, is, derived, from, persian, word, arazdashat, meaning, a, request, supplication, prayer, petition, or, an, address, to, a, superior, authority, ard, s, is, a, unique, prayer, based, on, the, fact, that, it, is, one, of, the, few, well, known, prayers, in, the, sikh, religion, that, was, not, written, in, its, entirety, by, the, gurus, the, ard, s, cannot, be, found, within, the, pages, of, the, guru, granth, sahib, because, it, is, a, continually, changing, devotional, text, that, has, evolved, over, time, in, order, for, it, to, encompass, the, feats, accomplishments, and, feelings, of, all, generations, of, sikhs, within, its, lines, taking, the, various, derivation, of, the, word, ard, s, into, account, the, basic, purpose, of, this, prayer, is, an, appeal, to, waheguru, for, his, protection, and, care, as, well, as, being, a, plea, for, the, welfare, and, prosperity, of, all, mankind, and, a, means, for, the, sikhs, to, thank, waheguru, for, all, that, he, has, done, zoroastrians, believe, that, the, elements, are, pure, and, that, fire, represents, god, s, light, or, wisdom, zoroastrian, worship, practices, have, evolved, from, ancient, times, to, the, present, day, over, time, zoroastrians, developed, the, concept, of, worshipping, in, temples, sometimes, called, fire, temples, wiccan, prayers, can, include, meditation, rituals, and, incantations, wiccans, see, prayers, as, a, form, of, communication, with, the, god, and, goddess, such, communication, may, include, prayers, for, esbat, and, sabbat, celebrations, for, dinner, for, pre, dawn, times, or, for, one, s, own, or, others, safety, for, healing, or, for, the, dead, in, ra, lism, rites, and,

ceremonies, take, place, on, certain, special, days, on, the, raelian, calendar, sensual, meditation, techniques, include, breathing, exercises, and, various, forms, of, erotic, meditation, in, eckankar, one, of, the, basic, forms, of, prayer, includes, singing, the, word, hu, pronounced, as, hue, a, holy, name, of, god, eckists, may, do, this, with, eyes, closed, or, open, aloud, or, silently, practitioners, may, experience, the, divine, eck, or, holy, spirit, practitioners, of, theurgy, and, western, esotericism, may, practice, a, form, of, ritual, which, uses, both, pre, sanctioned, prayers, and, names, of, god, and, prayers, from, the, heart, that, when, combined, allow, the, participant, to, ascend, spiritually, and, in, some, instances, induce, a, trance, in, which, god, or, other, spiritual, beings, may, be, realized, very, much, as, in, hermetic, qabalah, and, orthodox, kabbalah, it, is, believed, that, prayer, can, influence, both, the, physical, and, non, physical, worlds, the, use, of, ritualistic, signs, and, names, are, believed, to, be, archetypes, in, which, the, subconscious, may, take, form, as, the, inner, god, or, another, spiritual, being, and, the, prayer, from, the, heart, to, be, that, spiritual, force, speaking, through, the, participant, in, thelema, which, includes, both, theist, as, well, as, atheist, practitioners, adherents, share, a, number, of, practices, that, are, forms, of, individual, prayer, including, basic, yoga, asana, and, pranayama, various, forms, of, ritual, magick, rituals, of, one, s, own, devising, often, based, upon, a, syncretism, of, religions, or, western, esotericism, such, as, the, lesser, banishing, ritual, of, the, pentagram, and, star, ruby, and, performance, of, liber, resh, vel, helios, aka, liber, 200, which, consists, of, four, daily, adorations, to, the, sun, often, consisting, of, four, hand, body, positions, and, recitation, of, a, memorized, song, normally, spoken, addressing, different, godforms, identified, with, the, sun, while, no, dogma, within, thelema, expresses, the, purpose, behind, any, individual, aspirant, who, chooses, to, perform, resh, note, that, the, practice, of, resh, is, not, a, simple, petition, toward, the, sun, nor, a, form, of, worshiping, the, celestial, body, that, we, call, the, sun, but, instead, uses, the, positioning, of, that, source, of, light, which, enables, life, on, our, planet, as, well, as, using, mythological, images, of, that, solar, force, so, that, the, individual, can, perform, the, prayer, possibly, furthering, a, self, identification, with, the, sun, so, that, repeated, application, of, the, liber, resh, adorations, expands, the, consciousness, of, the, individual, by, compelling, him, to, take, a, different, perspective, by, inducing, him, to, look, at, things, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, sun, prayer, is, often, used, as, a, means, of, faith, healing, in, an, attempt, to, use, religious, or, spiritual, means, to, prevent, illness, cure, disease, or, improve, health, scientific, studies, regarding, the, use, of, prayer, have, mostly, concentrated, on, its, effect, on, the, healing, of, sick, or, injured, people, meta, studies, have, been, performed, showing, evidence, only, for, no, effect, or, a, potentially, small, effect, for, instance, a, 2006, meta, analysis, on, 14, studies, concluded, that, there, is, no, discernable, effect, while, a, 2007, systemic, review, of, studies, on, intercessory, prayer, reported, inconclusive, results, noting, that, seven, of, 17, studies, had, small, but, significant, effect, sizes, but, the, review, noted, that, the, most, methodologically, rigorous, studies, failed, to, produce, significant, findings, some, studies, have, indicated, increased, medical, complications, in, groups, receiving, prayer, over, those, without, the, efficacy, of, petition, in, prayer, for, physical, healing, to, a, deity, has, been, evaluated, in, numerous, other, studies, with, contradictory, results, there, has, been, some, criticism, of, the, way, the, studies, were, conducted, some, attempt, to, heal, by, prayer, mental, practices, spiritual, insights, or, other, techniques, claiming, they, can, summon, divine, or, supernatural, intervention, on, behalf, of, the, ill, others, advocate, that, ill, people, may, achieve, healing, through, prayer, performed, by, themselves, according, to, the, varied, beliefs, of, those, who, practice, it, faith, healing, may, be, said, to, afford, gradual, relief, from, pain, or, sickness, or, to, bring, about, a, sudden, miracle, cure, and, it, may, be, used, in, place, of, or, in, tandem, with, conventional, medical, techniques, for, alleviating, or, curing, diseases, faith, healing, has, been, criticized, on, the, grounds, that, those, who, use, it, may, delay, seeking, potentially, curative, conventional, medical, care, this, is, particularly, problematic, when, parents, use, faith, healing, techniques, on, children, in, 1872, francis, galton, conducted, a, famous, statistical, experiment, to, determine, whether, prayer, had, a, physical, effect, on, the, external, environment, galton, hypothesized, that, if, prayer, was, effective, members, of, the, british, royal, family, would, live, longer, given, that, thousands, prayed, for, their, wellbeing, every, sunday, he, therefore, compared, longevity, in, the, british, royal, family, with, that, of, the, general, population, and, found, no, difference, while, the, experiment, was, probably, intended, to, satirize, and, suffered, from, a, number, of, confounders, it, set, the, precedent, for, a, number, of, different, studies, the, results, of, which, are, contradictory, two, studies, claimed, that, patients, who, are, being, prayed, for, recover, more, quickly, or, more, frequently, although, critics, have, claimed, that, the, methodology, of, such, studies, are, flawed, and, the, perceived, effect, disappears, when, controls, are, tightened, one, such, study, with, a, double, blind, design, and, about, 500, subjects, per, group, was, published, in, 1988, it, suggested, that, intercessory, prayer, by, born, again, christians, had, a, statistically, significant, positive, effect, on, a, coronary, care, unit, population, critics, contend, that, there, were, severe, methodological, problems, with, this, study, another, such, study, was, reported, by, harris, et, al, critics, also, claim, that, the, 1988, study, was, not, fully, double, blinded, and, that, in, the, harris, study, patients, actually, had, a, longer, hospital, stay, in, the, prayer, group, if, one, discounts, the, patients, in, both, groups, who, left, before, prayers, began, although, the, harris, study, did, demonstrate, the, prayed, for, patients, on, average, received, lower, course, scores, indicating, better, recovery, one, of, the, largest, randomized, blind, clinical, trials, was, a, remote, retroactive, intercessory, prayer, study, conducted, in, israel, by, leibovici, this, study, used, 3393, patient, records, from, 1990, to, 1996, and, blindly, assigned, some, of, these, to, an, intercessory, prayer, group, the, prayer, group, had, shorter, hospital, stays, and, duration, of, fever, several, studies, of, prayer, effectiveness, have, yielded, null, results, a, 2001, double, blind, study, of, the, mayo, clinic, found, no, significant, difference, in, the, recovery, rates, between, people, who, were, unbeknownst, to, them, assigned, to, a, group, that, prayed, for, them, and, those, who, were, not, similarly, the, mantra, study, conducted, by, duke, university, found, no, differences, in, outcome, of, cardiac, procedures, as, a, result, of, prayer, in, another, similar, study, published, in, the, american, heart, journal, in, 2006, christian, intercessory, prayer, when, reading, a, scripted, prayer, was, found, to, have, no, effect, on, the, recovery, of, heart, surgery, patients, however, the, study, found, patients, who, had, knowledge, of, receiving, prayer, had, slightly, higher, instances, of, complications, than, those, who, did, not, know, if, they, were, being, prayed, for, or, those, who, did, not, receive, prayer, another, 2006, study, suggested, that, prayer, actually, had, a, significant, negative, effect, on, the, recovery, of, cardiac, bypass, patients, resulting, in, more, frequent, deaths, and, slower, recovery, time, for, those, patient, who, received, prayers, many, believe, that, prayer, can, aid, in, recovery, not, due, to, divine, influence, but, due, to, psychological, and, physical, benefits, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, if, a, person, knows, that, he, or, she, is, being, prayed, for, it, can, be, uplifting, and, increase, morale, thus, aiding, recovery, see, subject, expectancy, effect, many, studies, have, suggested, that, prayer, can, reduce, physical, stress, regardless, of, the, god, or, gods, a, person, prays, to, and, this, may, be, true, for, many, worldly, reasons, according, to, a, study, by, centra, state, hospital, the, psychological, benefits, of, prayer, may, help, reduce, stress, and, anxiety, promote, a, more, positive, outlook, and, strengthen, the, will, to, live, other, practices, such, as, yoga, tai, chi, and, meditation, may, also, have, a, positive, impact, on, physical, and, psychological, health, others, feel, that, the, concept, of, conducting, prayer, experiments, reflects, a, misunderstanding, of, the, purpose, of, prayer, the, previously, mentioned, study, published, in, the, american, heart, journal, indicated, that, some, of, the, intercessors, who, took, part, in, it, complained, about, the, scripted, nature, of, the, prayers, that, were, imposed, to, them, saying, that, this, is, not, the, way, they, usually, conduct, prayer, prior, to, the, start, of, this, study, intercessors, reported, that, they, usually, receive, information, about, the, patient, s, age, gender, and, progress, reports, on, their, medical, condition, converse, with, family, members, or, the, patient, not, by, fax, from, a, third, party, use, individualized, prayers, of, their, own, choosing, and, pray, for, a, variable, time, period, based, on, patient, or, family, request, one, scientific, movement, attempts, to, track, the, physical, effects, of, prayer, through, neuroscience, leaders, in, this, movement, include, andrew, newberg, an, associate, professor, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, in, newberg, s, brain, scans, monks, priests, nuns, sisters, and, gurus, alike, have, exceptionally, focused, attention, and, compassion, sites, this, is, a, result, of, the, frontal, lobe, of, the, brain, s, engagement, newberg, 2009, newburg, believes, that, anybody, can, connect, to, the, supernatural, with, practice, those, without, religious, affiliations, benefit, from, the, connection, to, the, metaphysical, as, well, newberg, also, states, that, further, evidence, towards, humans, need, for, metaphysical, relationships, is, that, as, science, had, increased, spirituality, has, not, decreased, newburg, believes, that, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, when, the, scientific, method, began, to, consume, the, human, mind, religion, could, have, vanished, however, two, hundred, years, later, the, perception, of, spirituality, in, many, instances, appears, to, be, gaining, in, strength, 2009, newberg, s, research, also, provides, the, connection, between, prayer, and, meditation, and, health, by, understanding, how, the, brain, works, during, religious, experiences, and, practices, newberg, s, research, shows, that, the, brain, changes, during, these, practices, allowing, an, understanding, of, how, religion, affects, psychological, and, physical, health, 2009, for, example, brain, activity, during, meditation, indicates, that, people, who, frequently, practice, prayer, or, meditation, experience, lower, blood, pressure, lower, heart, rates, decreased, anxiety, and, decreased, depression, another, paradigm, of, research, returns, to, the, princeton, engineering, anomalies, research, 1979, 2007, which, has, provided, an, explanatory, model, for, mind, matter, interactions, jahn, and, his, colleagues, explain, the, local, and, nonlocal, effects, of, consciousness, by, an, explanation, of, the, normal, pathways, through, those, intentions, life, prayer, can, change, the, praying, person, s, emotion, and, behavior, and, anomalous, pathways, which, can, affect, another, one, through, the, unconscious, implicit, order, trajectory, via, quantum, nonlocality, mechanism, one, study, found, that, prayer, combined, with, ivf, treatment, nearly, doubled, the, number, of, women, who, were, successfully, pregnant, and, more, than, doubled, the, number, of, successful, implantations, but, three, years, later, it, was, revealed, that, the, results, of, the, study, were, fake, some, modalities, of, alternative, medicine, employ, prayer, a, survey, released, in, may, 2004, by, the, national, center, for, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, part, of, the, national, institutes, of, health, in, the, united, states, found, that, in, 2002, 43, of, americans, pray, for, their, own, health, 24, pray, for, others, health, and, 10, participate, in, a, prayer,
