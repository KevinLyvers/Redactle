saul, israel, s, king, unlawfully, offers, a, sacrifice, and, later, disobeys, a, divine, command, both, to, kill, all, of, the, amalekites, and, to, destroy, their, confiscated, property, consequently, god, sends, the, prophet, samuel, to, anoint, a, shepherd, david, the, youngest, son, of, jesse, of, bethlehem, to, be, king, instead, after, god, sends, an, evil, spirit, to, torment, saul, his, servants, recommend, that, he, send, for, a, man, skilled, in, playing, the, lyre, a, servant, proposes, david, whom, the, servant, describes, as, skillful, in, playing, a, man, of, valor, a, warrior, prudent, in, speech, and, a, man, of, good, presence, and, the, lord, is, with, him, david, enters, saul, s, service, as, one, of, the, royal, armour, bearers, and, plays, the, lyre, to, soothe, the, king, war, comes, between, israel, and, the, philistines, and, the, giant, goliath, challenges, the, israelites, to, send, out, a, champion, to, face, him, in, single, combat, david, sent, by, his, father, to, bring, provisions, to, his, brothers, serving, in, saul, s, army, declares, that, he, can, defeat, goliath, refusing, the, king, s, offer, of, the, royal, armour, he, kills, goliath, with, his, sling, saul, inquires, the, name, of, the, young, hero, s, father, saul, sets, david, over, his, army, all, israel, loves, david, but, his, popularity, causes, saul, to, fear, him, what, else, can, he, wish, but, the, kingdom, saul, plots, his, death, but, saul, s, son, jonathan, one, of, those, who, loves, david, warns, him, of, his, father, s, schemes, and, david, flees, he, goes, first, to, nob, where, he, is, fed, by, the, priest, ahimelech, and, given, goliath, s, sword, and, then, to, gath, the, philistine, city, of, goliath, intending, to, seek, refuge, with, king, achish, there, achish, s, servants, or, officials, question, his, loyalty, and, david, sees, that, he, is, in, danger, there, he, goes, next, to, the, cave, of, adullam, where, his, family, joins, him, from, there, he, goes, to, seek, refuge, with, the, king, of, moab, but, the, prophet, gad, advises, him, to, leave, and, he, goes, to, the, forest, of, hereth, and, then, to, keilah, where, he, is, involved, in, a, further, battle, with, the, philistines, saul, plans, to, besiege, keilah, so, that, he, can, capture, david, so, david, leaves, the, city, in, order, to, protect, its, inhabitants, from, there, he, takes, refuge, in, the, mountainous, wilderness, of, ziph, jonathan, meets, with, david, again, and, confirms, his, loyalty, to, david, as, the, future, king, after, the, people, of, ziph, notify, saul, that, david, is, taking, refuge, in, their, territory, saul, seeks, confirmation, and, plans, to, capture, david, in, the, wilderness, of, maon, but, his, attention, is, diverted, by, a, renewed, philistine, invasion, and, david, is, able, to, secure, some, respite, at, ein, gedi, returning, from, battle, with, the, philistines, saul, heads, to, ein, gedi, in, pursuit, of, david, needing, privacy, to, attend, to, his, needs, saul, enters, the, cave, where, as, it, happens, david, and, his, supporters, are, hiding, david, realises, he, has, an, opportunity, to, kill, saul, but, instead, he, secretly, cuts, off, a, piece, of, saul, s, robe, when, saul, leaves, the, cave, david, comes, out, to, pay, homage, to, the, king, and, to, demonstrate, using, the, piece, of, robe, that, he, holds, no, malice, towards, him, the, two, are, thus, reconciled, and, saul, recognises, david, as, his, successor, a, similar, passage, occurs, in, 1, samuel, 26, when, david, is, able, to, infiltrate, saul, s, camp, on, the, hill, of, hachilah, and, remove, his, spear, and, a, jug, of, water, from, his, side, while, he, and, his, guards, lie, asleep, in, this, account, david, is, advised, by, abishai, that, this, is, his, opportunity, to, kill, saul, but, david, declines, saying, he, will, not, stretch, out, hand, against, the, lord, s, anointed, in, the, morning, david, once, again, demonstrates, to, saul, that, despite, ample, opportunity, he, did, not, deign, to, harm, him, saul, despite, having, already, reconciled, with, david, confesses, that, he, has, been, wrong, to, pursue, david, and, blesses, him, in, 1, samuel, 27, 1, 4, david, begins, to, doubt, saul, s, sincerity, and, reasons, that, the, king, will, eventually, make, another, attempt, on, his, life, david, appeals, to, king, achish, of, gath, to, grant, him, and, his, family, sanctuary, achish, agrees, and, upon, hearing, that, david, has, fled, to, philistia, saul, ceases, to, pursue, him, though, no, such, pursuit, seemed, to, be, in, progress, at, the, time, achish, permits, david, to, reside, in, ziklag, close, to, the, border, between, philistia, and, judah, to, further, ingratiate, himself, to, achish, and, the, philistines, david, and, his, men, raid, the, geshurites, the, girzites, and, the, amalekites, but, lead, the, royal, court, to, believe, they, are, attacking, the, israelites, the, jerahmeelites, and, the, kenites, while, achish, comes, to, believe, that, david, had, become, a, loyal, vassal, the, princes, or, lords, of, gath, remain, unconvinced, and, at, their, request, achish, instructs, david, to, remain, behind, to, guard, the, camp, when, the, philistines, march, against, saul, david, returns, to, ziklag, and, saves, his, wives, and, the, citizens, from, an, amalekite, raid, jonathan, and, saul, are, killed, in, battle, with, the, philistines, and, after, hearing, of, their, deaths, david, travels, to, hebron, where, he, is, anointed, king, over, judah, in, the, north, saul, s, son, ish, bosheth, is, anointed, king, of, israel, and, war, ensues, until, ish, bosheth, is, murdered, with, the, death, of, saul, s, son, the, elders, of, israel, come, to, hebron, and, david, is, anointed, king, over, all, of, israel, he, conquers, jerusalem, previously, a, jebusite, stronghold, and, makes, it, his, capital, he, brings, the, ark, of, the, covenant, to, the, city, intending, to, build, a, temple, for, god, but, the, prophet, nathan, forbids, it, prophesying, that, the, temple, would, be, built, by, one, of, david, s, sons, nathan, also, prophesies, that, god, has, made, a, covenant, with, the, house, of, david, stating, your, throne, shall, be, established, forever, david, wins, additional, victories, over, the, philistines, moabites, edomites, amalekites, ammonites, and, king, hadadezer, of, aram, zobah, after, which, they, become, tributaries, his, fame, increases, as, a, result, earning, the, praise, of, figures, like, king, toi, of, hamath, hadadezer, s, rival, during, a, siege, of, the, ammonite, capital, of, rabbah, david, remains, in, jerusalem, he, spies, a, woman, bathsheba, bathing, and, summons, her, she, becomes, pregnant, the, text, in, the, bible, does, not, explicitly, state, whether, bathsheba, consented, to, sex, with, david, david, calls, her, husband, uriah, the, hittite, back, from, the, battle, to, rest, hoping, that, he, will, go, home, to, have, sex, with, his, wife, and, the, child, will, be, presumed, to, be, his, uriah, does, not, visit, his, wife, however, so, david, conspires, to, have, him, killed, in, the, heat, of, battle, david, then, marries, the, widowed, bathsheba, in, response, nathan, after, trapping, the, king, in, his, guilt, with, a, parable, that, actually, described, his, sin, in, analogy, prophesies, the, punishment, that, will, fall, upon, him, stating, the, sword, shall, never, depart, from, your, house, when, david, acknowledges, that, he, has, sinned, nathan, advises, him, that, his, sin, is, forgiven, and, he, will, not, die, but, the, child, will, in, fulfillment, of, nathan, s, words, the, child, born, of, the, union, between, david, and, bathsheba, dies, and, another, of, david, s, sons, absalom, fueled, by, vengeance, and, lust, for, power, rebels, thanks, to, hushai, a, friend, of, david, who, was, ordered, to, infiltrate, absalom, s, court, to, successfully, sabotage, his, plans, absalom, s, forces, are, routed, at, the, battle, of, the, wood, of, ephraim, and, he, is, caught, by, his, long, hair, in, the, branches, of, a, tree, where, contrary, to, david, s, order, he, is, killed, by, joab, the, commander, of, david, s, army, david, laments, the, death, of, his, favourite, son, o, my, son, absalom, my, son, my, son, absalom, would, i, had, died, instead, of, you, o, absalom, my, son, my, son, until, joab, persuades, him, to, recover, from, the, extravagance, of, his, grief, and, to, fulfill, his, duty, to, his, people, david, returns, to, gilgal, and, is, escorted, across, the, river, jordan, and, back, to, jerusalem, by, the, tribes, of, judah, and, benjamin, when, david, is, old, and, bedridden, adonijah, his, eldest, surviving, son, and, natural, heir, declares, himself, king, bathsheba, and, nathan, go, to, david, and, obtain, his, agreement, to, crown, bathsheba, s, son, solomon, as, king, according, to, david, s, earlier, promise, and, the, revolt, of, adonijah, is, put, down, david, dies, at, the, age, of, 70, after, reigning, for, 40, years, and, on, his, deathbed, counsels, solomon, to, walk, in, the, ways, of, god, and, to, take, revenge, on, his, enemies, the, book, of, samuel, calls, david, a, skillful, harp, lyre, player, and, the, sweet, psalmist, of, israel, yet, while, almost, half, of, the, psalms, are, headed, a, psalm, of, david, also, translated, as, to, david, or, for, david, and, tradition, identifies, several, with, specific, events, in, david, s, life, e, g, psalms, 3, 7, 18, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, and, 142, the, headings, are, late, additions, and, no, psalm, can, be, attributed, to, david, with, certainty, psalm, 34, is, attributed, to, david, on, the, occasion, of, his, escape, from, abimelech, or, king, achish, by, pretending, to, be, insane, according, to, the, parallel, narrative, in, 1, samuel, 21, instead, of, killing, the, man, who, had, exacted, so, many, casualties, from, him, abimelech, allows, david, to, leave, exclaiming, am, i, so, short, of, madmen, that, you, have, to, bring, this, fellow, here, to, carry, on, like, this, in, front, of, me, must, this, man, come, into, my, house, david, is, an, important, figure, in, rabbinic, judaism, with, many, legends, about, him, according, to, one, tradition, david, was, raised, as, the, son, of, his, father, jesse, and, spent, his, early, years, herding, his, father, s, sheep, in, the, wilderness, while, his, brothers, were, in, school, david, s, adultery, with, bathsheba, is, interpreted, as, an, opportunity, to, demonstrate, the, power, of, repentance, and, the, talmud, says, it, was, not, adultery, at, all, citing, a, jewish, practice, of, divorce, on, the, eve, of, battle, furthermore, according, to, talmudic, sources, uriah, s, death, was, not, murder, because, uriah, had, committed, a, capital, offense, by, refusing, to, obey, a, direct, command, from, the, king, however, in, tractate, sanhedrin, david, expressed, remorse, over, his, transgressions, and, sought, forgiveness, god, ultimately, forgave, david, and, bathsheba, but, would, not, remove, their, sins, from, scripture, in, jewish, legend, david, s, sin, with, bathsheba, is, the, punishment, for, david, s, excessive, self, consciousness, he, had, besought, god, to, lead, him, into, temptation, so, that, he, might, give, proof, of, his, constancy, like, abraham, isaac, and, jacob, who, successfully, passed, the, test, and, whose, names, later, were, united, with, god, s, while, david, failed, through, the, temptation, of, a, woman, according, to, midrashim, adam, gave, up, 70, years, of, his, life, for, the, life, of, david, also, according, to, the, talmud, yerushalmi, david, was, born, and, died, on, the, jewish, holiday, of, shavuot, feast, of, weeks, his, piety, was, said, to, be, so, great, that, his, prayers, could, bring, down, things, from, heaven, the, messiah, concept, is, fundamental, in, christianity, originally, an, earthly, king, ruling, by, divine, appointment, the, anointed, one, as, the, title, messiah, had, it, in, the, last, two, centuries, bce, the, son, of, david, became, the, apocalyptic, and, heavenly, one, who, would, deliver, israel, and, usher, in, a, new, kingdom, this, was, the, background, to, the, concept, of, messiahship, in, early, christianity, which, interpreted, the, career, of, jesus, by, means, of, the, titles, and, functions, assigned, to, david, in, the, mysticism, of, the, zion, cult, in, which, he, served, as, priest, king, and, in, which, he, was, the, mediator, between, god, and, man, the, early, church, believed, that, the, life, of, david, foreshadowed, the, life, of, christ, bethlehem, is, the, birthplace, of, both, the, shepherd, life, of, david, points, out, christ, the, good, shepherd, the, five, stones, chosen, to, slay, goliath, are, typical, of, the, five, wounds, the, betrayal, by, his, trusted, counsellor, ahitophel, and, the, passage, over, the, cedron, remind, us, of, christ, s, sacred, passion, many, of, the, davidic, psalms, as, we, learn, from, the, new, testament, are, clearly, typical, of, the, future, messiah, in, the, middle, ages, charlemagne, thought, of, himself, and, was, viewed, by, his, court, scholars, as, a, new, david, not, in, itself, a, new, idea, but, content, and, significance, were, greatly, enlarged, by, him, western, rite, churches, lutheran, roman, catholic, celebrate, david, s, feast, day, on, 29, december, or, 6, october, eastern, rite, on, 19, december, the, eastern, orthodox, and, eastern, catholic, churches, celebrate, the, feast, day, of, the, holy, righteous, prophet, and, king, david,

when, he, is, commemorated, together, with, other, ancestors, of, jesus, he, is, also, commemorated, on, the, sunday, after, the, nativity, together, with, joseph, and, james, the, brother, of, the, lord, and, on, 26, december, synaxis, of, the, mother, of, god, in, european, christian, culture, of, the, middle, ages, david, was, made, a, member, of, the, nine, worthies, a, group, of, heroes, encapsulating, all, the, ideal, qualities, of, chivalry, his, life, was, thus, proposed, as, a, valuable, subject, for, study, by, those, aspiring, to, chivalric, status, this, aspect, of, david, in, the, nine, worthies, was, popularised, first, through, literature, and, thereafter, adopted, as, a, frequent, subject, for, painters, and, sculptors, david, was, considered, a, model, ruler, and, a, symbol, of, divinely, ordained, monarchy, throughout, medieval, western, europe, and, eastern, christendom, he, was, perceived, as, the, biblical, predecessor, to, christian, roman, and, byzantine, emperors, and, the, name, new, david, was, used, as, an, honorific, reference, to, these, rulers, the, georgian, bagratids, and, the, solomonic, dynasty, of, ethiopia, claimed, direct, biological, descent, from, him, likewise, kings, of, the, frankish, carolingian, dynasty, frequently, connected, themselves, to, david, charlemagne, himself, occasionally, used, david, his, pseudonym, david,

as, well, as, the, psalms, regarded, as, books, of, divine, wisdom, q4, 163, q17, 55, the, birds, and, mountains, united, with, david, in, uttering, praise, to, god, q21, 79, q34, 10, q38, 18, while, god, made, iron, soft, for, david, q34, 10, god, also, instructed, david, in, the, art, of, fashioning, chain, mail, out, of, iron, q21, 80, this, knowledge, gave, david, a, major, advantage, over,

78, and, david, judged, the, matter, between, two, disputants, in, his, prayer, chamber, q38, 21, 23, since, there, is, no, mention, in, the, quran, of, the, wrong, david, did, to, uriah, nor, any, reference, to, bathsheba, muslims, reject, this, narrative, muslim, tradition, and, the, hadith, stress, david, s, zeal, in, daily, prayer, as, well, as, in, fasting, quran, commentators, historians, and, compilers, of, the, numerous, stories, of, the, prophets, elaborate, upon, david, s, concise, quranic, narratives, and, specifically, mention, david, s, gift, in, singing, his, psalms, his, beautiful, recitation, and, his, vocal, talents, his, voice, is, described, as, having, a, captivating, power, weaving, its, influence, not, only, over, man, but, over, all, beasts, and, nature, who, would, unite, with, him, to, praise, god, biblical, literature, and, archaeological, finds, are, the, only, sources, that, attest, to, david, s, life, some, scholars, have, concluded, that, this, was, likely, compiled, from, contemporary, records, of, the, 11th, and, 10th, centuries, bce, but, that, there, is, no, clear, historical, basis, for, determining, the, exact, date, of, compilation, other, scholars, believe, that, the, books, of, samuel, were, substantially, composed, during, the, time, of, josiah, king, of, judah, at, the, end, of, the, 7th, century, bce, extended, during, the, babylonian, captivity, and, substantially, complete, by, about, 550, bce, old, testament, scholar, a, graeme, auld, contends, that, further, editing, was, done, even, after, then, the, silver, quarter, shekel, saul, s, servant, offers, to, samuel, in, 1, samuel, 9, 8, almost, certainly, fixes, the, date, of, the, story, in, the, persian, or, hellenistic, period, because, a, quarter, shekel, was, known, to, exist, in, hasmonean, times, the, authors, and, editors, of, samuel, drew, on, many, earlier, sources, including, for, their, history, of, david, the, history, of, david, s, rise, and, the, succession, narrative, the, books, of, chronicles, which, tells, the, story, from, a, different, point, of, view, was, probably, composed, in, the, period, 350, 300, bce, and, uses, samuel, and, kings, as, its, source, biblical, evidence, indicates, that, david, s, judah, was, something, less, than, a, full, fledged, monarchy, it, often, calls, him, nagid, prince, chief, hebrew, romanized, n, g, rather, than, melekh, king, david, sets, up, none, of, the, complex, bureaucracy, that, a, kingdom, needs, his, army, is, made, up, of, volunteers, and, his, followers, are, largely, relations, or, from, his, home, region, of, hebron, beyond, this, the, full, range, of, possible, interpretations, is, available, a, number, of, scholars, consider, the, david, story, to, be, a, heroic, tale, similar, to, the, legend, of, king, arthur, or, the, epics, of, homer, while, others, find, such, comparisons, questionable, one, theme, paralleled, with, other, near, eastern, literature, is, the, homoerotic, nature, of, the, relationship, between, david, and, jonathan, the, instance, in, the, book, of, jashar, excerpted, in, 2, samuel, 1, 26, where, david, proclaims, that, jonathan, s, love, was, sweeter, to, him, than, the, love, of, a, woman, has, been, compared, to, achilles, comparison, of, patroclus, to, a, girl, and, gilgamesh, s, love, for, enkidu, as, a, woman, others, hold, that, the, david, story, is, a, political, apology, an, answer, to, contemporary, charges, against, him, of, his, involvement, in, murders, and, regicide, the, authors, and, editors, of, samuel, and, chronicles, aimed, not, to, record, history, but, to, promote, david, s, reign, as, inevitable, and, desirable, and, for, this, reason, there, is, little, about, david, that, is, concrete, and, undisputed, other, scholars, argue, that, notwithstanding, the, apologetic, tenor, of, the, story, the, authors, of, samuel, were, also, critical, of, david, in, several, respects, suggesting, that, the, text, presents, a, complex, portrait, of, him, rather, than, a, purely, propagandistic, one, some, other, studies, of, david, have, been, written, baruch, halpern, has, pictured, him, as, a, brutal, tyrant, a, murderer, and, a, lifelong, vassal, of, achish, the, philistine, king, of, gath, steven, mckenzie, argues, that, david, came, from, a, wealthy, family, and, was, an, ambitious, and, ruthless, tyrant, who, murdered, his, opponents, including, his, sons, joel, s, baden, has, called, him, an, ambitious, ruthless, flesh, and, blood, man, who, achieved, power, by, any, means, necessary, including, murder, theft, bribery, sex, deceit, and, treason, william, g, dever, described, him, as, a, serial, killer, jacob, l, wright, has, written, that, the, most, popular, legends, about, david, including, his, killing, of, goliath, his, affair, with, bathsheba, and, his, ruling, of, the, unified, kingdom, of, israel, rather, than, just, judah, are, the, creation, of, those, who, lived, generations, after, him, in, particular, those, living, in, the, late, persian, or, hellenistic, periods, the, tel, dan, stele, discovered, in, 1993, is, an, inscribed, stone, erected, by, hazael, a, king, of, damascus, in, the, late, 9th, early, 8th, centuries, bce, it, commemorates, the, king, s, victory, over, two, enemy, kings, and, contains, the, phrase, bytdwd, which, most, scholars, translate, as, house, of, david, other, scholars, have, challenged, this, reading, but, this, is, likely, a, reference, to, a, dynasty, of, the, kingdom, of, judah, which, traced, its, ancestry, to, a, founder, named, david, two, epigraphers, andr, lemaire, and, mile, puech, hypothesised, in, 1994, that, the, mesha, stele, from, moab, dating, from, the, 9th, century, also, contain, the, words, house, of, david, at, the, end, of, line, 31, although, this, was, considered, as, less, certain, than, the, mention, in, the, tel, dan, inscription, in, may, 2019, israel, finkelstein, nadav, na, aman, and, thomas, r, mer, concluded, from, the, new, images, that, the, ruler, s, name, contained, three, consonants, and, started, with, a, bet, which, excludes, the, reading, house, of, david, and, in, conjunction, with, the, monarch, s, city, of, residence, horonaim, in, moab, makes, it, likely, that, the, one, mentioned, is, king, balak, a, name, also, known, from, the, hebrew, bible, later, that, year, michael, langlois, used, high, resolution, photographs, of, both, the, inscription, itself, and, the, 19th, century, original, squeeze, of, the, then, still, intact, stele, to, reaffirm, lemaire, s, view, that, line, 31, contains, the, phrase, house, of, david, replying, to, langlois, na, aman, argued, that, the, house, of, david, reading, is, unacceptable, because, the, resulting, sentence, structure, is, extremely, rare, in, west, semitic, royal, inscriptions, besides, the, two, steles, bible, scholar, and, egyptologist, kenneth, kitchen, suggests, that, david, s, name, also, appears, in, a, relief, of, the, pharaoh, shoshenq, i, who, is, usually, identified, with, shishak, in, the, bible, the, relief, claims, that, shoshenq, raided, places, in, palestine, in, 925, bce, and, kitchen, interprets, one, place, as, heights, of, david, which, was, in, southern, judah, and, the, negev, where, the, bible, says, david, took, refuge, from, saul, the, relief, is, damaged, and, interpretation, is, uncertain, of, the, evidence, in, question, john, haralson, hayes, and, james, maxwell, miller, wrote, in, 2006, if, one, is, not, convinced, in, advance, by, the, biblical, profile, then, there, is, nothing, in, the, archaeological, evidence, itself, to, suggest, that, much, of, consequence, was, going, on, in, palestine, during, the, tenth, century, bce, and, certainly, nothing, to, suggest, that, jerusalem, was, a, great, political, and, cultural, center, this, echoed, the, 1995, conclusion, of, am, lie, kuhrt, who, noted, that, there, are, no, royal, inscriptions, from, the, time, of, the, united, monarchy, indeed, very, little, written, material, altogether, and, not, a, single, contemporary, reference, to, either, david, or, solomon, while, noting, against, this, must, be, set, the, evidence, for, substantial, development, and, growth, at, several, sites, which, is, plausibly, related, to, the, tenth, century, in, 2007, israel, finkelstein, and, neil, asher, silberman, stated, that, the, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, judah, was, sparsely, inhabited, and, jerusalem, no, more, than, a, small, village, the, evidence, suggested, that, david, ruled, only, as, a, chieftain, over, an, area, which, cannot, be, described, as, a, state, or, as, a, kingdom, but, more, as, a, chiefdom, much, smaller, and, always, overshadowed, by, the, older, and, more, powerful, kingdom, of, israel, to, the, north, they, posited, that, israel, and, judah, were, not, monotheistic, at, the, time, and, that, later, 7th, century, redactors, sought, to, portray, a, past, golden, age, of, a, united, monotheistic, monarchy, in, order, to, serve, contemporary, needs, they, noted, a, lack, of, archeological, evidence, for, david, s, military, campaigns, and, a, relative, underdevelopment, of, jerusalem, the, capital, of, judah, compared, to, a, more, developed, and, urbanized, samaria, capital, of, israel, during, the, 9th, century, bce, in, 2010, amihai, mazar, wrote, that, the, united, monarchy, of, the, 10th, century, bce, can, be, described, as, a, state, in, development, he, compared, david, to, labaya, a, caananite, warlord, living, during, the, time, of, pharaoh, akhenaten, while, mazar, believes, that, david, reigned, over, israel, during, the, 11th, century, bce, he, argues, that, much, of, the, biblical, text, is, of, literary, legendary, nature, according, to, william, g, dever, the, reigns, of, saul, david, and, solomon, are, reasonably, well, attested, but, most, archeologists, today, would, argue, that, the, united, monarchy, was, not, much, more, than, a, kind, of, hill, country, chiefdom, lester, l, grabbe, wrote, in, 2017, the, main, question, is, what, kind, of, settlement, jerusalem, was, in, iron, iia, was, it, a, minor, settlement, perhaps, a, large, village, or, possibly, a, citadel, but, not, a, city, or, was, it, the, capital, of, a, flourishing, or, at, least, an, emerging, state, assessments, differ, considerably, isaac, kalimi, wrote, in, 2018, no, contemporaneous, extra, biblical, source, offers, any, account, of, the, political, situation, in, israel, and, judah, during, the, tenth, century, bce, and, as, we, have, seen, the, archaeological, remains, themselves, cannot, provide, any, unambiguous, evidence, of, events, the, view, of, davidic, jerusalem, as, a, village, has, been, challenged, by, eilat, mazar, s, excavation, of, the, large, stone, structure, and, the, stepped, stone, structure, in, 2005, mazar, proposed, that, these, two, structures, may, have, been, architecturally, linked, as, one, unit, and, that, they, date, to, the, time, of, king, david, mazar, supports, this, dating, with, a, number, of, artifacts, including, pottery, two, phoenician, style, ivory, inlays, a, black, and, red, jug, and, a, radiocarbon, dated, bone, estimated, to, be, from, the, 10th, century, dever, amihai, mazar, avraham, faust, and, nadav, na, aman, have, argued, in, favour, of, the, 10th, century, bce, dating, and, responded, to, challenges, to, it, in, 2010, eilat, mazar, announced, the, discovery, of, part, of, the, ancient, city, walls, around, the, city, of, david, which, she, believes, date, to, the, 10th, century, bce, according, to, mazar, this, would, prove, that, an, organized, state, did, exist, in, the, 10th, century, in, 2006, kenneth, kitchen, came, to, a, similar, conclusion, arguing, that, the, physical, archaeology, of, tenth, century, canaan, is, consistent, with, the, former, existence, of, a, unified, state, on, its, terrain, scholars, such, as, israel, finkelstein, lily, singer, avitz, ze, ev, herzog, and, david, ussishkin, do, not, accept, these, conclusions, finkelstein, does, not, accept, the, dating, of, these, structures, to, the, 10th, century, bce, based, in, part, on, the, fact, that, later, structures, on, the, site, penetrated, deep, into, underlying, layers, that, the, entire, area, had, been, excavated, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, then, backfilled, that, pottery, from, later, periods, was, found, below, earlier, strata, and, that, consequently, the, finds, collected, by, e, mazar, cannot, necessarily, be, considered, as, retrieved, in, situ, aren, maeir, said, in, 2010, that, he, has, seen, no, evidence, that, these, structures, are, from, the, 10th, century, bce, and, that, proof, of, the, existence, of, a, strong, centralized, kingdom, at, that, time, remains, tenuous, excavations, at, khirbet, qeiyafa, by, archaeologists, yosef, garfinkel, and, saar, ganor, found, an, urbanized, settlement, radiocarbon, dated, to, the, 10th, century, which, supports, the, existence, of, an, urbanised, kingdom, the, israel, antiquities, authority, stated, the, excavations, at, khirbat, qeiyafa, clearly, reveal, an, urban, society, that, existed, in, judah, already, in, the, late, eleventh, century, bce, it, can, no, longer, be, argued, that, the, kingdom, of, judah, developed, only, in, the, late, eighth, century, bce, or, at, some, other, later, date, but, other, scholars, have, criticized, the, techniques, and, interpretations, to, reach, some, conclusions, related, to, khirbet, qeiyafa, such, as, israel, finkelstein, and, alexander, fantalkin, of, tel, aviv, university, who, have, instead, proposed, that, the, city, is, to, be, identified, as, part, of, a, northern, israelite, polity, in, 2018, avraham, faust, and, yair, sapir, stated, that, a, canaanite, site, at, tel, eton, about, 30, miles, from, jerusalem, was, taken, over, by, a, judahite, community, by, peaceful, assimilation, and, transformed, from, a, village, into, a, central, town, at, some, point, in, the, late, 11th, or, early, 10th, century, bce, this, transformation, used, some, ashlar, blocks, in, construction, which, they, argued, supports, the, united, monarchy, theory, literary, works, about, david, include, david, has, been, depicted, several, times, in,
