https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination
predestination, in, theology, is, the, doctrine, that, all, events, have, been, willed, by, god, usually, with, reference, to, the, eventual, fate, of, the, individual, soul, explanations, of, predestination, often, seek, to, address, the, paradox, of, free, will, whereby, god, s, omniscience, seems, incompatible, with, human, free, will, in, this, usage, predestination, can, be, regarded, as, a, form, of, religious, determinism, and, usually, predeterminism, also, known, as, theological, determinism, some, have, argued, that, the, book, of, enoch, contains, a, deterministic, worldview, that, is, combined, with, dualism, the, book, of, jubilees, seems, to, harmonize, or, mix, together, a, doctrine, of, free, will, and, determinism, ben, sira, affirms, free, will, where, god, allows, a, choice, of, bad, or, good, before, the, human, and, thus, they, can, choose, which, one, to, follow, there, is, some, disagreement, among, scholars, regarding, the, views, on, predestination, of, first, century, ad, judaism, out, of, which, christianity, came, josephus, wrote, during, the, first, century, that, the, three, main, jewish, sects, differed, on, this, question, he, argued, that, the, essenes, and, pharisees, argued, that, god, s, providence, orders, all, human, events, but, the, pharisees, still, maintained, that, people, are, able, to, choose, between, right, and, wrong, he, wrote, that, the, sadducees, did, not, have, a, doctrine, of, providence, biblical, scholar, n, t, wright, argues, that, josephus, s, portrayal, of, these, groups, is, incorrect, and, that, the, jewish, debates, referenced, by, josephus, should, be, seen, as, having, to, do, with, god, s, work, to, liberate, israel, rather, than, philosophical, questions, about, predestination, wright, asserts, that, essenes, were, content, to, wait, for, god, to, liberate, israel, while, pharisees, believed, jews, needed, to, act, in, cooperation, with, god, john, barclay, responded, that, josephus, s, description, was, an, over, simplification, and, there, were, likely, to, be, complex, differences, between, these, groups, which, may, have, been, similar, to, those, described, by, josephus, francis, watson, has, also, argued, on, the, basis, of, 4, ezra, a, document, dated, to, the, first, century, ad, that, jewish, beliefs, in, predestination, are, primarily, concerned, with, god, s, choice, to, save, some, individual, jews, however, some, in, the, qumran, community, possibly, believed, in, predestination, for, example, 1qs, states, that, god, has, caused, his, chosen, ones, to, inherit, the, lot, of, the, holy, ones, in, the, new, testament, romans, 8, 11, presents, a, statement, on, predestination, in, romans, 8, 28, 30, paul, writes, we, know, that, in, everything, god, works, for, good, with, those, who, love, him, who, are, called, according, to, his, purpose, for, those, whom, he, foreknew, he, also, predestined, to, be, conformed, to, the, image, of, his, son, in, order, that, he, might, be, the, first, born, among, many, brethren, and, those, whom, he, predestined, he, also, called, and, those, whom, he, called, he, also, justified, and, those, whom, he, justified, he, also, glorified, biblical, scholars, have, interpreted, this, passage, in, several, ways, many, say, this, only, has, to, do, with, service, and, is, not, about, salvation, the, catholic, biblical, commentator, brendan, byrne, wrote, that, the, predestination, mentioned, in, this, passage, should, be, interpreted, as, applied, to, the, christian, community, corporately, rather, than, individuals, another, catholic, commentator, joseph, fitzmyer, wrote, that, this, passage, teaches, that, god, has, predestined, the, salvation, of, all, humans, douglas, moo, a, protestant, biblical, interpreter, reads, the, passage, as, teaching, that, god, has, predestined, a, certain, set, of, people, to, salvation, and, predestined, the, remainder, of, humanity, to, reprobation, damnation, similarly, wright, s, interpretation, is, that, in, this, passage, paul, teaches, that, god, will, save, those, whom, he, has, chosen, but, wright, also, emphasizes, that, paul, does, not, intend, to, suggest, that, god, has, eliminated, human, free, will, or, responsibility, instead, wright, asserts, paul, is, saying, that, god, s, will, works, through, that, of, humans, to, accomplish, salvation, origen, writing, in, the, third, century, taught, that, god, s, providence, extends, to, every, individual, he, believed, god, s, predestination, was, based, on, god, s, foreknowledge, of, every, individual, s, merits, whether, in, their, current, life, or, a, previous, life, gill, and, gregg, alisson, argued, that, clement, of, rome, held, to, a, predestinarian, view, of, salvation, some, verses, in, the, odes, of, solomon, which, was, made, by, an, essene, convert, into, christianity, might, possibly, suggest, a, predestinarian, worldview, where, god, chooses, who, are, saved, and, go, into, heaven, although, there, is, controversy, about, what, it, teaches, the, odes, of, solomon, talks, about, god, imprinting, a, seal, on, the, face, of, the, elect, before, they, existed, the, thomasines, saw, themselves, as, children, of, the, light, but, the, ones, who, were, not, part, of, the, elect, community, were, sons, of, darkness, the, thomasines, thus, had, a, belief, in, a, type, of, election, or, predestination, they, saw, themselves, as, elect, because, they, were, born, from, the, light, valentinus, believed, in, a, form, of, predestination, in, his, view, humans, are, born, into, one, of, three, natures, depending, on, which, elements, prevail, in, the, person, in, the, views, of, valentinus, a, person, born, with, a, bad, nature, can, never, be, saved, because, they, are, too, inclined, into, evil, some, people, have, a, nature, which, is, a, mixture, of, good, and, evil, thus, they, can, choose, salvation, and, others, have, a, good, nature, who, will, be, saved, because, they, will, be, inclined, into, good, irenaeus, also, attacked, the, doctrine, of, predestination, set, out, by, valentinus, arguing, that, it, is, unfair, for, irenaeus, humans, were, free, to, choose, salvation, or, not, justin, martyr, attacked, predestinarian, views, held, by, some, greek, philosophers, later, in, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, also, taught, that, god, orders, all, things, while, preserving, human, freedom, prior, to, 396, augustine, believed, that, predestination, was, based, on, god, s, foreknowledge, of, whether, individuals, would, believe, that, god, s, grace, was, a, reward, for, human, assent, later, in, response, to, pelagius, augustine, said, that, the, sin, of, pride, consists, in, assuming, that, we, are, the, ones, who, choose, god, or, that, god, chooses, us, in, his, foreknowledge, because, of, something, worthy, in, us, and, argued, that, it, is, god, s, grace, that, causes, the, individual, act, of, faith, scholars, are, divided, over, whether, augustine, s, teaching, implies, double, predestination, or, the, belief, that, god, chooses, some, people, for, damnation, as, well, as, some, for, salvation, catholic, scholars, tend, to, deny, that, he, held, such, a, view, while, some, protestants, and, secular, scholars, affirm, that, augustine, did, believe, in, double, predestination, augustine, s, position, raised, objections, julian, of, eclanum, expressed, the, view, that, augustine, was, bringing, manichean, thoughts, into, the, church, for, vincent, of, l, rins, this, was, a, disturbing, innovation, this, new, tension, eventually, became, obvious, with, the, confrontation, between, augustine, and, pelagius, culminating, in, condemnation, of, pelagianism, as, interpreted, by, augustine, at, the, council, of, ephesus, in, 431, pelagius, denied, augustine, s, view, of, predestination, in, order, to, affirm, that, salvation, is, achieved, by, an, act, of, free, will, the, council, of, arles, in, the, late, fifth, century, condemned, the, position, that, some, have, been, condemned, to, death, others, have, been, predestined, to, life, though, this, may, seem, to, follow, from, augustine, s, teaching, the, second, council, of, orange, in, 529, also, condemned, the, position, that, some, have, been, truly, predestined, to, evil, by, divine, power, in, the, eighth, century, john, of, damascus, emphasized, the, freedom, of, the, human, will, in, his, doctrine, of, predestination, and, argued, that, acts, arising, from, peoples, wills, are, not, part, of, god, s, providence, at, all, damascene, teaches, that, people, s, good, actions, are, done, in, cooperation, with, god, but, are, not, caused, by, him, prosper, of, aquitaine, 390, c, 455, ad, defended, augustine, s, view, of, predestination, against, semi, pelagians, marius, mercator, who, was, a, pupil, of, augustine, wrote, five, books, against, pelagianism, and, one, book, about, predestination, fulgentius, of, ruspe, and, caesarius, of, arles, rejected, the, view, that, god, gives, free, choice, to, believe, and, instead, believed, in, predestination, cassian, believed, that, despite, predestination, being, a, work, that, god, does, god, only, decides, to, predestinate, based, on, how, human, beings, will, respond, augustine, himself, stated, thus, and, thus, christ, s, church, has, never, failed, to, hold, the, faith, of, this, predestination, which, is, now, being, defended, with, new, solicitude, against, these, modern, heretics, augustine, gottschalk, of, orbais, a, ninth, century, saxon, monk, argued, that, god, predestines, some, people, to, hell, as, well, as, predestining, some, to, heaven, a, view, known, as, double, predestination, he, was, condemned, by, several, synods, but, his, views, remained, popular, irish, theologian, john, scotus, eriugena, wrote, a, refutation, of, gottschalk, eriugena, abandoned, augustine, s, teaching, on, predestination, he, wrote, that, god, s, predestination, should, be, equated, with, his, foreknowledge, of, people, s, choices, in, the, thirteenth, century, thomas, aquinas, taught, that, god, predestines, certain, people, to, the, beatific, vision, based, solely, on, his, own, goodness, rather, than, that, of, creatures, aquinas, also, believed, that, people, are, free, in, their, choices, fully, cause, their, own, sin, and, are, solely, responsible, for, it, according, to, aquinas, there, are, several, ways, in, which, god, wills, actions, he, directly, wills, the, good, indirectly, wills, evil, consequences, of, good, things, and, only, permits, evil, aquinas, held, that, in, permitting, evil, god, does, not, will, it, to, be, done, or, not, to, be, done, in, the, thirteenth, century, william, of, ockham, taught, that, god, does, not, cause, human, choices, and, equated, predestination, with, divine, foreknowledge, though, ockham, taught, that, god, predestines, based, on, people, s, foreseen, works, he, maintained, that, god, s, will, was, not, constrained, to, do, this, medieval, theologians, who, believed, in, predestination, include, ratramnus, died, 868, thomas, bradwardine, 1300, 1349, gregory, of, rimini, 1300, 1358, john, wycliffe, 1320s, 1384, johann, ruchrat, von, wesel, died, 1481, girolamo, savonarola, 1452, 1498, and, johannes, von, staupitz, 1460, 1524, the, medieval, cathars, denied, the, free, will, of, humans, john, calvin, rejected, the, idea, that, god, permits, rather, than, actively, decrees, the, damnation, of, sinners, as, well, as, other, evil, calvin, did, not, believe, god, to, be, guilty, of, sin, but, rather, he, considered, god, inflicting, sin, upon, his, creations, to, be, an, unfathomable, mystery, though, he, maintained, god, s, predestination, applies, to, damnation, as, well, as, salvation, he, taught, that, the, damnation, of, the, damned, is, caused, by, their, sin, but, that, the, salvation, of, the, saved, is, solely, caused, by, god, other, protestant, reformers, including, huldrych, zwingli, also, held, double, predestinarian, views, the, eastern, orthodox, view, was, summarized, by, bishop, theophan, the, recluse, in, response, to, the, question, what, is, the, relationship, between, the, divine, provision, and, our, free, will, answer, the, fact, that, the, kingdom, of, god, is, taken, by, force, presupposes, personal, effort, when, the, apostle, paul, says, it, is, not, of, him, that, willeth, this, means, that, one, s, efforts, do, not, produce, what, is, sought, it, is, necessary, to, combine, them, to, strive, and, to, expect, all, things, from, grace, it, is, not, one, s, own, efforts, that, will, lead, to, the, goal, because, without, grace, efforts, produce, little, nor, does, grace, without, effort, bring, what, is, sought, because, grace, acts, in, us, and, for, us, through, our, efforts, both, combine, in, a, person, to, bring, progress, and, carry, him, to, the, goal, god, s, foreknowledge, is, unfathomable, it, is, enough, for, us, with, our, whole, heart, to, believe, that, it, never, opposes, god, s, grace, and, truth, and, that, it, does, not, infringe, man, s, freedom, usually, this, resolves, as, follows, god, foresees, how, a, man, will, freely, act, and, makes, dispositions, accordingly, divine, determination, depends, on, the, life, of, a, man, and, not, his, life, upon, the, determination, roman, catholicism, teaches, the, doctrine, of, predestination, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, says, to, god, all, moments, of, time, are, present, in, their, immediacy, when, therefore, he, establishes, his, eternal, plan, of, predestination, he, includes, in, it, each, person, s, free, response, to, his, grace, therefore, in, the, roman, catholic, conception, of, predestination, free, will, is, not, denied, however, roman, catholic, theology, has, discouraged, beliefs, that, it, is, possible, for, anyone, to, know, or, predict, anything, about, the, operation, and, outcomes, of, predestination, and, therefore, it, normally, plays, a, very, small, role, in, roman, catholic, thinking, the, heretical, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, sect, within, roman, catholicism, known, as, jansenism, preached, the, doctrine, of, double, predestination, although, jansenism, claimed, that, even, members, of, the, saved, elect, could, lose, their, salvation, by, doing, sinful, un, repented, deeds, as, implied, in, ezekiel, 18, 21, 28, in, the, old, testament, of, the, bible, according, to, the, roman, catholic, church, god, does, not, will, anyone, to, mortally, sin, and, so, to, deserve, punishment, in, hell, pope, john, paul, ii, wrote, the, universality, of, salvation, means, that, it, is, granted, not, only, to, those, who, explicitly, believe, in, christ, and, have, entered, the, church, since, salvation, is, offered, to, all, it, must, be, made, concretely, available, to, all, but, it, is, clear, that, today, as, in, the, past, many, people, do, not, have, an, opportunity, to, come, to, know, or, accept, the, gospel, revelation, or, to, enter, the, church, for, such, people, salvation, in, christ, is, accessible, by, virtue, of, a, grace, which, while, having, a, mysterious, relationship, to, the, church, does, not, make, them, formally, part, of, the, church, but, enlightens, them, in, a, way, which, is, accommodated, to, their, spiritual, and, material, situation, this, grace, comes, from, christ, it, is, the, result, of, his, sacrifice, and, is, communicated, by, the, holy, spirit, it, enables, each, person, to, attain, salvation, through, his, or, her, free, cooperation, augustine, of, hippo, laid, the, foundation, for, much, of, the, later, roman, catholic, teaching, on, predestination, his, teachings, on, grace, and, free, will, were, largely, adopted, by, the, second, council, of, orange, 529, whose, decrees, were, directed, against, the, semipelagians, augustine, wrote, promised, not, from, the, power, of, our, will, but, from, his, own, predestination, for, he, promised, what, he, himself, would, do, not, what, men, would, do, because, although, men, do, those, good, things, which, pertain, to, god, s, worship, he, himself, makes, them, to, do, what, he, has, commanded, it, is, not, they, that, cause, him, to, do, what, he, has, promised, otherwise, the, fulfilment, of, god, s, promises, would, not, be, in, the, power, of, god, but, in, that, of, men, augustine, also, teaches, that, people, have, free, will, for, example, in, on, grace, and, free, will, see, especially, chapters, ii, iv, augustine, states, that, he, has, revealed, to, us, through, his, holy, scriptures, that, there, is, in, man, a, free, choice, of, will, and, that, god, s, precepts, themselves, would, be, of, no, use, to, a, man, unless, he, had, free, choice, of, will, so, that, by, performing, them, he, might, obtain, the, promised, rewards, chap, ii, thomas, aquinas, views, concerning, predestination, are, largely, in, agreement, with, augustine, and, can, be, summarized, by, many, of, his, writings, in, his, summa, theologi, god, does, reprobate, some, for, it, was, said, above, a, that, predestination, is, a, part, of, providence, to, providence, however, it, belongs, to, permit, certain, defects, in, those, things, which, are, subject, to, providence, as, was, said, above, q, a, thus, as, men, are, ordained, to, eternal, life, through, the, providence, of, god, it, likewise, is, part, of, that, providence, to, permit, some, to, fall, away, from, that, end, this, is, called, reprobation, thus, as, predestination, is, a, part, of, providence, in, regard, to, those, ordained, to, eternal, salvation, so, reprobation, is, a, part, of, providence, in, regard, to, those, who, turn, aside, from, that, end, hence, reprobation, implies, not, only, foreknowledge, but, also, something, more, as, does, providence, as, was, said, above, q, a, therefore, as, predestination, includes, the, will, to, confer, grace, and, glory, so, also, reprobation, includes, the, will, to, permit, a, person, to, fall, into, sin, and, to, impose, the, punishment, of, damnation, on, account, of, that, sin, this, table, summarizes, the, classical, views, of, three, different, protestant, beliefs, lutherans, historically, hold, to, unconditional, election, to, salvation, however, some, do, not, believe, that, there, are, certain, people, that, are, predestined, to, salvation, but, salvation, is, predestined, for, those, who, seek, god, lutherans, believe, christians, should, be, assured, that, they, are, among, the, predestined, however, they, disagree, with, those, who, make, predestination, the, source, of, salvation, rather, than, christ, s, suffering, death, and, resurrection, unlike, some, calvinists, lutherans, do, not, believe, in, a, predestination, to, damnation, instead, lutherans, teach, eternal, damnation, is, a, result, of, the, unbeliever, s, rejection, of, the, forgiveness, of, sins, and, unbelief, martin, luther, s, attitude, towards, predestination, is, set, out, in, his, on, the, bondage, of, the, will, published, in, 1525, this, publication, by, luther, was, in, response, to, the, published, treatise, by, desiderius, erasmus, in, 1524, known, as, on, free, will, the, belgic, confession, of, 1561, affirmed, that, god, delivers, and, preserves, from, perdition, all, whom, he, in, his, eternal, and, unchangeable, council, of, mere, goodness, hath, elected, in, christ, jesus, our, lord, without, respect, to, their, works, article, xvi, calvinists, believe, that, god, picked, those, whom, he, will, save, and, bring, with, him, to, heaven, before, the, world, was, created, they, also, believe, that, those, people, god, does, not, save, will, go, to, hell, john, calvin, thought, people, who, were, saved, could, never, lose, their, salvation, and, the, elect, those, god, saved, would, know, they, were, saved, because, of, their, actions, in, this, common, loose, sense, of, the, term, to, affirm, or, to, deny, predestination, has, particular, reference, to, the, calvinist, doctrine, of, unconditional, election, in, the, calvinist, interpretation, of, the, bible, this, doctrine, normally, has, only, pastoral, value, related, to, the, assurance, of, salvation, and, the, absolution, of, salvation, by, grace, alone, however, the, philosophical, implications, of, the, doctrine, of, election, and, predestination, are, sometimes, discussed, beyond, these, systematic, bounds, under, the, topic, of, the, doctrine, of, god, theology, proper, the, predestinating, decision, of, god, cannot, be, contingent, upon, anything, outside, of, himself, because, all, other, things, are, dependent, upon, him, for, existence, and, meaning, under, the, topic, of, the, doctrines, of, salvation, soteriology, the, predestinating, decision, of, god, is, made, from, god, s, knowledge, of, his, own, will, romans, 9, 15, and, is, therefore, not, contingent, upon, human, decisions, rather, free, human, decisions, are, outworkings, of, the, decision, of, god, which, sets, the, total, reality, within, which, those, decisions, are, made, in, exhaustive, detail, that, is, nothing, left, to, chance, calvinists, do, not, pretend, to, understand, how, this, works, but, they, are, insistent, that, the, scriptures, teach, both, the, sovereign, control, of, god, and, the, responsibility, and, freedom, of, human, decisions, calvinist, groups, use, the, term, hyper, calvinism, to, describe, calvinistic, systems, that, assert, without, qualification, that, god, s, intention, to, destroy, some, is, equal, to, his, intention, to, save, others, some, forms, of, hyper, calvinism, have, racial, implications, as, when, dutch, calvinist, theologian, franciscus, gomarus, argued, that, jews, because, of, their, refusal, to, worship, jesus, christ, were, members, of, the, non, elect, as, also, argued, by, john, calvin, himself, based, on, i, john, 2, 22, 23, in, the, new, testament, of, the, bible, some, dutch, settlers, in, south, africa, argued, that, black, people, were, sons, of, ham, whom, noah, had, cursed, to, be, slaves, according, to, genesis, 9, 18, 19, or, drew, analogies, between, them, and, the, canaanites, suggesting, a, chosen, people, ideology, similar, to, that, espoused, by, proponents, of, the, jewish, nation, this, justified, racial, hierarchy, on, earth, as, well, as, racial, segregation, of, congregations, but, did, not, exclude, blacks, from, being, part, of, the, elect, other, calvinists, vigorously, objected, to, these, arguments, see, afrikaner, calvinism, expressed, sympathetically, the, calvinist, doctrine, is, that, god, has, mercy, or, withholds, it, with, particular, consciousness, of, who, are, to, be, the, recipients, of, mercy, in, christ, therefore, the, particular, persons, are, chosen, out, of, the, total, number, of, human, beings, who, will, be, rescued, from, enslavement, to, sin, and, the, fear, of, death, and, from, punishment, due, to, sin, to, dwell, forever, in, his, presence, those, who, are, being, saved, are, assured, through, the, gifts, of, faith, the, sacraments, and, communion, with, god, through, prayer, and, increase, of, good, works, that, their, reconciliation, with, him, through, christ, is, settled, by, the, sovereign, determination, of, god, s, will, god, also, has, particular, consciousness, of, those, who, are, passed, over, by, his, selection, who, are, without, excuse, for, their, rebellion, against, him, and, will, be, judged, for, their, sins, calvinists, typically, divide, on, the, issue, of, predestination, into, infralapsarians, sometimes, called, sublapsarians, and, supralapsarians, infralapsarians, interpret, the, biblical, election, of, god, to, highlight, his, love, 1, john, 4, 8, ephesians, 1, 4b, 5a, and, chose, his, elect, considering, the, situation, after, the, fall, while, supralapsarians, interpret, biblical, election, to, highlight, god, s, sovereignty, romans, 9, 16, and, that, the, fall, was, ordained, by, god, s, decree, of, election, in, infralapsarianism, election, is, god, s, response, to, the, fall, while, in, supralapsarianism, the, fall, is, part, of, god, s, plan, for, election, in, spite, of, the, division, many, calvinist, theologians, would, consider, the, debate, surrounding, the, infra, and, supralapsarian, positions, one, in, which, scant, scriptural, evidence, can, be, mustered, in, either, direction, and, that, at, any, rate, has, little, effect, on, the, overall, doctrine, some, calvinists, decline, to, describe, the, eternal, decree, of, god, in, terms, of, a, sequence, of, events, or, thoughts, and, many, caution, against, the, simplifications, involved, in, describing, any, action, of, god, in, speculative, terms, most, make, distinctions, between, the, positive, manner, in, which, god, chooses, some, to, be, recipients, of, grace, and, the, manner, in, which, grace, is, consciously, withheld, so, that, some, are, destined, for, everlasting, punishments, debate, concerning, predestination, according, to, the, common, usage, concerns, the, destiny, of, the, damned, whether, god, is, just, if, that, destiny, is, settled, prior, to, the, existence, of, any, actual, volition, of, the, individual, and, whether, the, individual, is, in, any, meaningful, sense, responsible, for, his, destiny, if, it, is, settled, by, the, eternal, action, of, god, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, the, dutch, theologian, jacobus, arminius, formulated, arminianism, and, disagreed, with, calvin, in, particular, on, election, and, predestination, arminianism, is, defined, by, god, s, limited, mode, of, providence, this, mode, of, providence, affirms, the, compatibility, between, human, free, will, and, divine, foreknowledge, but, its, incompatibility, with, theological, determinism, thus, predestination, in, arminianism, is, based, on, divine, foreknowledge, unlike, in, calvinism, it, is, therefore, a, predestination, by, foreknowledge, from, this, perspective, comes, the, notion, of, a, conditional, election, on, the, one, who, wills, to, have, faith, in, god, for, salvation, this, means, that, god, does, not, predetermine, but, instead, infallibly, knows, who, will, believe, and, perseveringly, be, saved, although, god, knows, from, the, beginning, of, the, world, who, will, go, where, the, choice, is, still, with, the, individual, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, rejects, the, doctrine, of, predestination, but, does, believe, in, foreordination, foreordination, an, important, doctrine, of, the, lds, church, teaches, that, during, the, pre, mortal, existence, god, selected, foreordained, particular, people, to, fulfill, certain, missions, callings, during, their, mortal, lives, for, example, prophets, were, foreordained, to, be, the, lord, s, servants, see, jeremiah, 1, 5, all, who, receive, the, priesthood, were, foreordained, to, that, calling, and, jesus, was, foreordained, to, enact, the, atonement, however, all, such, persons, foreordained, retain, their, agency, in, mortality, to, fulfill, that, foreordination, or, not, the, lds, church, teaches, the, doctrine, of, moral, agency, the, ability, to, choose, and, act, for, oneself, and, decide, whether, to, accept, christ, s, atonement, conditional, election, is, the, belief, that, god, chooses, for, eternal, salvation, those, whom, he, foresees, will, have, faith, in, christ, this, belief, emphasizes, the, importance, of, a, person, s, free, will, the, counter, view, is, known, as, unconditional, election, and, is, the, belief, that, god, chooses, whomever, he, will, based, solely, on, his, purposes, and, apart, from, an, individual, s, free, will, it, has, long, been, an, issue, in, calvinist, arminian, debate, an, alternative, viewpoint, is, corporate, election, which, distinguishes, god, s, election, and, predestination, for, corporate, entities, such, as, the, community, in, christ, and, individuals, who, can, benefit, from, that, community, s, election, and, predestination, so, long, as, they, continue, belonging, to, that, community, infralapsarianism, also, called, sublapsarianism, holds, that, predestination, logically, coincides, with, the, preordination, of, man, s, fall, into, sin, that, is, god, predestined, sinful, men, for, salvation, therefore, according, to, this, view, god, is, the, ultimate, cause, but, not, the, proximate, source, or, author, of, sin, infralapsarians, often, emphasize, a, difference, between, god, s, decree, which, is, inviolable, and, inscrutable, and, his, revealed, will, against, which, man, is, disobedient, proponents, also, typically, emphasize, the, grace, and, mercy, of, god, toward, all, men, although, teaching, also, that, only, some, are, predestined, for, salvation, in, common, english, parlance, the, doctrine, of, predestination, often, has, particular, reference, to, the, doctrines, of, calvinism, the, version, of, predestination, espoused, by, john, calvin, after, whom, calvinism, is, named, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, double, predestination, because, in, it, god, predestines, some, people, for, salvation, i, e, unconditional, election, and, some, for, condemnation, i, e, reprobation, which, results, by, allowing, the, individual, s, own, sins, to, condemn, them, calvin, himself, defines, predestination, as, the, eternal, decree, of, god, by, which, he, determined, with, himself, whatever, he, wished, to, happen, with, regard, to, every, man, not, all, are, created, on, equal, terms, but, some, are, preordained, to, eternal, life, others, to, eternal, damnation, and, accordingly, as, each, has, been, created, for, one, or, other, of, these, ends, we, say, that, he, has, been, predestined, to, life, or, to, death, on, the, spectrum, of, beliefs, concerning, predestination, calvinism, is, the, strongest, form, among, christians, it, teaches, that, god, s, predestining, decision, is, based, on, the, knowledge, of, his, own, will, rather, than, foreknowledge, concerning, every, particular, person, and, event, and, god, continually, acts, with, entire, freedom, in, order, to, bring, about, his, will, in, completeness, but, in, such, a, way, that, the, freedom, of, the, creature, is, not, violated, but, rather, established, calvinists, who, hold, the, infralapsarian, view, of, predestination, usually, prefer, that, term, to, sublapsarianism, perhaps, with, the, intent, of, blocking, the, inference, that, they, believe, predestination, is, on, the, basis, of, foreknowledge, sublapsarian, meaning, assuming, the, fall, into, sin, the, different, terminology, has, the, benefit, of, distinguishing, the, calvinist, double, predestination, version, of, infralapsarianism, from, lutheranism, s, view, that, predestination, is, a, mystery, which, forbids, the, unprofitable, intrusion, of, prying, minds, since, god, only, reveals, partial, knowledge, to, the, human, race, supralapsarianism, is, the, doctrine, that, god, s, decree, of, predestination, for, salvation, and, reprobation, logically, precedes, his, preordination, of, the, human, race, s, fall, into, sin, that, is, god, decided, to, save, and, to, damn, he, then, determined, the, means, by, which, that, would, be, made, possible, it, is, a, matter, of, controversy, whether, or, not, calvin, himself, held, this, view, but, most, scholars, link, him, with, the, infralapsarian, position, it, is, known, however, that, calvin, s, successor, in, geneva, theodore, beza, held, to, the, supralapsarian, view, double, predestination, or, the, double, decree, is, the, doctrine, that, god, actively, reprobates, or, decrees, damnation, of, some, as, well, as, salvation, for, those, whom, he, has, elected, during, the, protestant, reformation, john, calvin, held, this, double, predestinarian, view, by, predestination, we, mean, the, eternal, decree, of, god, by, which, he, determined, with, himself, whatever, he, wished, to, happen, with, regard, to, every, man, all, are, not, created, on, equal, terms, but, some, are, preordained, to, eternal, life, others, to, eternal, damnation, and, accordingly, as, each, has, been, created, for, one, or, other, of, these, ends, we, say, that, he, has, been, predestinated, to, life, or, to, death, gottschalk, of, orbais, taught, double, predestination, explicitly, in, the, ninth, century, and, gregory, of, rimini, in, the, fourteenth, some, trace, this, doctrine, to, statements, made, by, augustine, in, the, early, fifth, century, that, on, their, own, also, seem, to, teach, double, predestination, but, in, the, context, of, his, other, writings, it, is, not, clear, whether, he, held, this, view, in, the, city, of, god, augustine, describes, all, of, humanity, as, being, predestinated, for, salvation, i, e, the, city, of, god, or, damnation, i, e, the, earthly, city, of, man, but, augustine, also, held, that, all, human, beings, were, born, reprobate, but, need, not, necessarily, remain, in, that, state, of, reprobation, corporate, election, is, a, non, traditional, arminian, view, of, election, in, corporate, election, god, does, not, choose, which, individuals, he, will, save, prior, to, creation, but, rather, god, chooses, the, church, as, a, whole, or, put, differently, god, chooses, what, type, of, individuals, he, will, save, another, way, the, new, testament, puts, this, is, to, say, that, god, chose, the, church, in, christ, eph, 1, 4, in, other, words, god, chose, from, all, eternity, to, save, all, those, who, would, be, found, in, christ, by, faith, in, god, this, choosing, is, not, primarily, about, salvation, from, eternal, destruction, either, but, is, about, god, s, chosen, agency, in, the, world, thus, individuals, have, full, freedom, in, terms, of, whether, they, become, members, of, the, church, or, not, corporate, election, is, thus, consistent, with, the, open, view, s, position, on, god, s, omniscience, which, states, that, god, s, foreknowledge, does, not, determine, the, outcomes, of, individual, free, will, middle, knowledge, is, a, concept, that, was, developed, by, jesuit, theologian, luis, de, molina, and, exists, under, a, doctrine, called, molinism, it, attempts, to, deal, with, the, topic, of, predestination, by, reconciling, god, s, sovereign, providence, with, the, notion, of, libertarian, free, will, the, concept, of, middle, knowledge, holds, that, god, has, a, knowledge, of, true, pre, volitional, counterfactuals, for, all, free, creatures, that, is, what, any, individual, creature, with, a, free, will, e, g, a, human, would, do, under, any, given, circumstance, god, s, knowledge, of, counterfactuals, is, reasoned, to, occur, logically, prior, to, his, divine, creative, decree, that, is, prior, to, creation, and, after, his, knowledge, of, necessary, truths, thus, middle, knowledge, holds, that, before, the, world, was, created, god, knew, what, every, existing, creature, capable, of, libertarian, freedom, e, g, every, individual, human, would, freely, choose, to, do, in, all, possible, circumstances, it, then, holds, that, based, on, this, information, god, elected, from, a, number, of, these, possible, worlds, the, world, most, consistent, with, his, ultimate, will, which, is, the, actual, world, that, we, live, in, for, example, based, on, this, middle, knowledge, god, has, the, ability, to, actualise, the, world, in, which, a, is, placed, in, a, circumstance, that, he, freely, chooses, to, do, what, is, consistent, with, gods, ultimate, will, if, god, determined, that, the, world, most, suited, to, his, purposes, is, a, world, in, which, a, would, freely, choose, y, instead, of, z, god, can, actualise, a, world, in, which, free, creature, a, finds, himself, in, circumstance, b, in, this, way, middle, knowledge, is, thought, of, by, its, proponents, to, be, consistent, with, any, theological, doctrines, that, assert, god, as, having, divine, providence, and, man, having, a, libertarian, freedom, e, g, calvinism, catholicism, lutheranism, and, to, offer, a, potential, solution, to, the, concerns, that, god, s, providence, somehow, nullifies, man, from, having, true, liberty, in, his, choices
