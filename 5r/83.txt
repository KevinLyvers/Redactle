philosophy, of, science, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, concerned, with, the, foundations, methods, and, implications, of, science, amongst, its, central, questions, are, the, difference, between, science, and, non, science, the, reliability, of, scientific, theories, and, the, ultimate, purpose, and, meaning, of, science, as, a, human, endeavour, philosophy, of, science, focuses, on, metaphysical, epistemic, and, semantic, aspects, of, scientific, practice, and, overlaps, with, metaphysics, ontology, logic, and, epistemology, for, example, when, it, explores, the, relationship, between, science, and, the, concept, of, truth, philosophy, of, science, is, both, a, theoretical, and, empirical, discipline, relying, on, philosophical, theorising, as, well, as, meta, studies, of, scientific, practice, ethical, issues, such, as, bioethics, and, scientific, misconduct, are, often, considered, ethics, or, science, studies, rather, than, the, philosophy, of, science, many, of, the, central, problems, concerned, with, the, philosophy, of, science, lack, contemporary, consensus, including, whether, science, can, infer, truth, about, unobservable, entities, and, whether, inductive, reasoning, can, be, justified, as, yielding, definite, scientific, knowledge, philosophers, of, science, also, consider, philosophical, problems, within, particular, sciences, such, as, biology, physics, and, social, sciences, such, as, economics, and, psychology, some, philosophers, of, science, also, use, contemporary, results, in, science, to, reach, conclusions, about, philosophy, itself, while, philosophical, thought, pertaining, to, science, dates, back, at, least, to, the, time, of, aristotle, the, general, philosophy, of, science, emerged, as, a, distinct, discipline, only, in, the, 20th, century, following, the, logical, positivist, movement, which, aimed, to, formulate, criteria, for, ensuring, all, philosophical, statements, meaningfulness, and, objectively, assessing, them, karl, popper, criticized, logical, positivism, and, helped, establish, a, modern, set, of, standards, for, scientific, methodology, thomas, kuhn, s, 1962, book, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, was, also, formative, challenging, the, view, of, scientific, progress, as, the, steady, cumulative, acquisition, of, knowledge, based, on, a, fixed, method, of, systematic, experimentation, and, instead, arguing, that, any, progress, is, relative, to, a, paradigm, the, set, of, questions, concepts, and, practices, that, define, a, scientific, discipline, in, a, particular, historical, period, subsequently, the, coherentist, approach, to, science, in, which, a, theory, is, validated, if, it, makes, sense, of, observations, as, part, of, a, coherent, whole, became, prominent, due, to, w, v, quine, and, others, some, thinkers, such, as, stephen, jay, gould, seek, to, ground, science, in, axiomatic, assumptions, such, as, the, uniformity, of, nature, a, vocal, minority, of, philosophers, and, paul, feyerabend, in, particular, argue, against, the, existence, of, the, scientific, method, so, all, approaches, to, science, should, be, allowed, including, explicitly, supernatural, ones, another, approach, to, thinking, about, science, involves, studying, how, knowledge, is, created, from, a, sociological, perspective, an, approach, represented, by, scholars, like, david, bloor, and, barry, barnes, finally, a, tradition, in, continental, philosophy, approaches, science, from, the, perspective, of, a, rigorous, analysis, of, human, experience, philosophies, of, the, particular, sciences, range, from, questions, about, the, nature, of, time, raised, by, einstein, s, general, relativity, to, the, implications, of, economics, for, public, policy, a, central, theme, is, whether, the, terms, of, one, scientific, theory, can, be, intra, or, intertheoretically, reduced, to, the, terms, of, another, can, chemistry, be, reduced, to, physics, or, can, sociology, be, reduced, to, individual, psychology, the, general, questions, of, philosophy, of, science, also, arise, with, greater, specificity, in, some, particular, sciences, for, instance, the, question, of, the, validity, of, scientific, reasoning, is, seen, in, a, different, guise, in, the, foundations, of, statistics, the, question, of, what, counts, as, science, and, what, should, be, excluded, arises, as, a, life, or, death, matter, in, the, philosophy, of, medicine, additionally, the, philosophies, of, biology, psychology, and, the, social, sciences, explore, whether, the, scientific, studies, of, human, nature, can, achieve, objectivity, or, are, inevitably, shaped, by, values, and, by, social, relations, distinguishing, between, science, and, non, science, is, referred, to, as, the, demarcation, problem, for, example, should, psychoanalysis, creation, science, and, historical, materialism, be, considered, pseudosciences, karl, popper, called, this, the, central, question, in, the, philosophy, of, science, however, no, unified, account, of, the, problem, has, won, acceptance, among, philosophers, and, some, regard, the, problem, as, unsolvable, or, uninteresting, martin, gardner, has, argued, for, the, use, of, a, potter, stewart, standard, i, know, it, when, i, see, it, for, recognizing, pseudoscience, early, attempts, by, the, logical, positivists, grounded, science, in, observation, while, non, science, was, non, observational, and, hence, meaningless, popper, argued, that, the, central, property, of, science, is, falsifiability, that, is, every, genuinely, scientific, claim, is, capable, of, being, proven, false, at, least, in, principle, an, area, of, study, or, speculation, that, masquerades, as, science, in, an, attempt, to, claim, a, legitimacy, that, it, would, not, otherwise, be, able, to, achieve, is, referred, to, as, pseudoscience, fringe, science, or, junk, science, physicist, richard, feynman, coined, the, term, cargo, cult, science, for, cases, in, which, researchers, believe, they, are, doing, science, because, their, activities, have, the, outward, appearance, of, it, but, actually, lack, the, kind, of, utter, honesty, that, allows, their, results, to, be, rigorously, evaluated, a, closely, related, question, is, what, counts, as, a, good, scientific, explanation, in, addition, to, providing, predictions, about, future, events, society, often, takes, scientific, theories, to, provide, explanations, for, events, that, occur, regularly, or, have, already, occurred, philosophers, have, investigated, the, criteria, by, which, a, scientific, theory, can, be, said, to, have, successfully, explained, a, phenomenon, as, well, as, what, it, means, to, say, a, scientific, theory, has, explanatory, power, one, early, and, influential, account, of, scientific, explanation, is, the, deductive, nomological, model, it, says, that, a, successful, scientific, explanation, must, deduce, the, occurrence, of, the, phenomena, in, question, from, a, scientific, law, this, view, has, been, subjected, to, substantial, criticism, resulting, in, several, widely, acknowledged, counterexamples, to, the, theory, it, is, especially, challenging, to, characterize, what, is, meant, by, an, explanation, when, the, thing, to, be, explained, cannot, be, deduced, from, any, law, because, it, is, a, matter, of, chance, or, otherwise, cannot, be, perfectly, predicted, from, what, is, known, wesley, salmon, developed, a, model, in, which, a, good, scientific, explanation, must, be, statistically, relevant, to, the, outcome, to, be, explained, others, have, argued, that, the, key, to, a, good, explanation, is, unifying, disparate, phenomena, or, providing, a, causal, mechanism, although, it, is, often, taken, for, granted, it, is, not, at, all, clear, how, one, can, infer, the, validity, of, a, general, statement, from, a, number, of, specific, instances, or, infer, the, truth, of, a, theory, from, a, series, of, successful, tests, for, example, a, chicken, observes, that, each, morning, the, farmer, comes, and, gives, it, food, for, hundreds, of, days, in, a, row, the, chicken, may, therefore, use, inductive, reasoning, to, infer, that, the, farmer, will, bring, food, every, morning, however, one, morning, the, farmer, comes, and, kills, the, chicken, how, is, scientific, reasoning, more, trustworthy, than, the, chicken, s, reasoning, one, approach, is, to, acknowledge, that, induction, cannot, achieve, certainty, but, observing, more, instances, of, a, general, statement, can, at, least, make, the, general, statement, more, probable, so, the, chicken, would, be, right, to, conclude, from, all, those, mornings, that, it, is, likely, the, farmer, will, come, with, food, again, the, next, morning, even, if, it, cannot, be, certain, however, there, remain, difficult, questions, about, the, process, of, interpreting, any, given, evidence, into, a, probability, that, the, general, statement, is, true, one, way, out, of, these, particular, difficulties, is, to, declare, that, all, beliefs, about, scientific, theories, are, subjective, or, personal, and, correct, reasoning, is, merely, about, how, evidence, should, change, one, s, subjective, beliefs, over, time, some, argue, that, what, scientists, do, is, not, inductive, reasoning, at, all, but, rather, abductive, reasoning, or, inference, to, the, best, explanation, in, this, account, science, is, not, about, generalizing, specific, instances, but, rather, about, hypothesizing, explanations, for, what, is, observed, as, discussed, in, the, previous, section, it, is, not, always, clear, what, is, meant, by, the, best, explanation, ockham, s, razor, which, counsels, choosing, the, simplest, available, explanation, thus, plays, an, important, role, in, some, versions, of, this, approach, to, return, to, the, example, of, the, chicken, would, it, be, simpler, to, suppose, that, the, farmer, cares, about, it, and, will, continue, taking, care, of, it, indefinitely, or, that, the, farmer, is, fattening, it, up, for, slaughter, philosophers, have, tried, to, make, this, heuristic, principle, more, precise, regarding, theoretical, parsimony, or, other, measures, yet, although, various, measures, of, simplicity, have, been, brought, forward, as, potential, candidates, it, is, generally, accepted, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, theory, independent, measure, of, simplicity, in, other, words, there, appear, to, be, as, many, different, measures, of, simplicity, as, there, are, theories, themselves, and, the, task, of, choosing, between, measures, of, simplicity, appears, to, be, every, bit, as, problematic, as, the, job, of, choosing, between, theories, nicholas, maxwell, has, argued, for, some, decades, that, unity, rather, than, simplicity, is, the, key, non, empirical, factor, in, influencing, the, choice, of, theory, in, science, persistent, preference, for, unified, theories, in, effect, committing, science, to, the, acceptance, of, a, metaphysical, thesis, concerning, unity, in, nature, in, order, to, improve, this, problematic, thesis, it, needs, to, be, represented, in, the, form, of, a, hierarchy, of, theses, each, thesis, becoming, more, insubstantial, as, one, goes, up, the, hierarchy, when, making, observations, scientists, look, through, telescopes, study, images, on, electronic, screens, record, meter, readings, and, so, on, generally, on, a, basic, level, they, can, agree, on, what, they, see, e, g, the, thermometer, shows, 37, 9, degrees, c, but, if, these, scientists, have, different, ideas, about, the, theories, that, have, been, developed, to, explain, these, basic, observations, they, may, disagree, about, what, they, are, observing, for, example, before, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, observers, would, have, likely, interpreted, an, image, of, the, einstein, cross, as, five, different, objects, in, space, in, light, of, that, theory, however, astronomers, will, tell, you, that, there, are, actually, only, two, objects, one, in, the, center, and, four, different, images, of, a, second, object, around, the, sides, alternatively, if, other, scientists, suspect, that, something, is, wrong, with, the, telescope, and, only, one, object, is, actually, being, observed, they, are, operating, under, yet, another, theory, observations, that, cannot, be, separated, from, theoretical, interpretation, are, said, to, be, theory, laden, all, observation, involves, both, perception, and, cognition, that, is, one, does, not, make, an, observation, passively, but, rather, is, actively, engaged, in, distinguishing, the, phenomenon, being, observed, from, surrounding, sensory, data, therefore, observations, are, affected, by, one, s, underlying, understanding, of, the, way, in, which, the, world, functions, and, that, understanding, may, influence, what, is, perceived, noticed, or, deemed, worthy, of, consideration, in, this, sense, it, can, be, argued, that, all, observation, is, theory, laden, should, science, aim, to, determine, ultimate, truth, or, are, there, questions, that, science, cannot, answer, scientific, realists, claim, that, science, aims, at, truth, and, that, one, ought, to, regard, scientific, theories, as, true, approximately, true, or, likely, true, conversely, scientific, anti, realists, argue, that, science, does, not, aim, or, at, least, does, not, succeed, at, truth, especially, truth, about, unobservables, like, electrons, or, other, universes, instrumentalists, argue, that, scientific, theories, should, only, be, evaluated, on, whether, they, are, useful, in, their, view, whether, theories, are, true, or, not, is, beside, the, point, because, the, purpose, of, science, is, to, make, predictions, and, enable, effective, technology, realists, often, point, to, the, success, of, recent, scientific, theories, as, evidence, for, the, truth, or, near, truth, of, current, theories, antirealists, point, to, either, the, many, false, theories, in, the, history, of, science, epistemic, morals, the, success, of, false, modeling, assumptions, or, widely, termed, postmodern, criticisms, of, objectivity, as, evidence, against, scientific, realism, antirealists, attempt, to, explain, the, success, of, scientific, theories, without, reference, to, truth, some, antirealists, claim, that, scientific, theories, aim, at, being, accurate, only, about, observable, objects, and, argue, that, their, success, is, primarily, judged, by, that, criterion, the, notion, of, real, patterns, has, been, propounded, notably, by, philosopher, daniel, c, dennett, as, an, intermediate, position, between, strong, realism, and, eliminative, materialism, this, concept, delves, into, the, investigation, of, patterns, observed, in, scientific, phenomena, to, ascertain, whether, they, signify, underlying, truths, or, are, mere, constructs, of, human, interpretation, dennett, provides, a, unique, ontological, account, concerning, real, patterns, examining, the, extent, to, which, these, recognized, patterns, have, predictive, utility, and, allow, for, efficient, compression, of, information, the, discourse, on, real, patterns, extends, beyond, philosophical, circles, finding, relevance, in, various, scientific, domains, for, example, in, biology, inquiries, into, real, patterns, seek, to, elucidate, the, nature, of, biological, explanations, exploring, how, recognized, patterns, contribute, to, a, comprehensive, understanding, of, biological, phenomena, similarly, in, chemistry, debates, around, the, reality, of, chemical, bonds, as, real, patterns, continue, evaluation, of, real, patterns, also, holds, significance, in, broader, scientific, inquiries, researchers, like, tyler, millhouse, propose, criteria, for, evaluating, the, realness, of, a, pattern, particularly, in, the, context, of, universal, patterns, and, the, human, propensity, to, perceive, patterns, even, where, there, might, be, none, this, evaluation, is, pivotal, in, advancing, research, in, diverse, fields, from, climate, change, to, machine, learning, where, recognition, and, validation, of, real, patterns, in, scientific, models, play, a, crucial, role, values, intersect, with, science, in, different, ways, there, are, epistemic, values, that, mainly, guide, the, scientific, research, the, scientific, enterprise, is, embedded, in, particular, culture, and, values, through, individual, practitioners, values, emerge, from, science, both, as, product, and, process, and, can, be, distributed, among, several, cultures, in, the, society, when, it, comes, to, the, justification, of, science, in, the, sense, of, general, public, participation, by, single, practitioners, science, plays, the, role, of, a, mediator, between, evaluating, the, standards, and, policies, of, society, and, its, participating, individuals, wherefore, science, indeed, falls, victim, to, vandalism, and, sabotage, adapting, the, means, to, the, end, if, it, is, unclear, what, counts, as, science, how, the, process, of, confirming, theories, works, and, what, the, purpose, of, science, is, there, is, considerable, scope, for, values, and, other, social, influences, to, shape, science, indeed, values, can, play, a, role, ranging, from, determining, which, research, gets, funded, to, influencing, which, theories, achieve, scientific, consensus, for, example, in, the, 19th, century, cultural, values, held, by, scientists, about, race, shaped, research, on, evolution, and, values, concerning, social, class, influenced, debates, on, phrenology, considered, scientific, at, the, time, feminist, philosophers, of, science, sociologists, of, science, and, others, explore, how, social, values, affect, science, the, origins, of, philosophy, of, science, trace, back, to, plato, and, aristotle, who, distinguished, the, forms, of, approximate, and, exact, reasoning, set, out, the, threefold, scheme, of, abductive, deductive, and, inductive, inference, and, also, analyzed, reasoning, by, analogy, the, eleventh, century, arab, polymath, ibn, al, haytham, known, in, latin, as, alhazen, conducted, his, research, in, optics, by, way, of, controlled, experimental, testing, and, applied, geometry, especially, in, his, investigations, into, the, images, resulting, from, the, reflection, and, refraction, of, light, roger, bacon, 1214, 1294, an, english, thinker, and, experimenter, heavily, influenced, by, al, haytham, is, recognized, by, many, to, be, the, father, of, modern, scientific, method, his, view, that, mathematics, was, essential, to, a, correct, understanding, of, natural, philosophy, is, considered, to, have, been, 400, years, ahead, of, its, time, francis, bacon, no, direct, relation, to, roger, bacon, who, lived, 300, years, earlier, was, a, seminal, figure, in, philosophy, of, science, at, the, time, of, the, scientific, revolution, in, his, work, novum, organum, 1620, an, allusion, to, aristotle, s, organon, bacon, outlined, a, new, system, of, logic, to, improve, upon, the, old, philosophical, process, of, syllogism, bacon, s, method, relied, on, experimental, histories, to, eliminate, alternative, theories, in, 1637, ren, descartes, established, a, new, framework, for, grounding, scientific, knowledge, in, his, treatise, discourse, on, method, advocating, the, central, role, of, reason, as, opposed, to, sensory, experience, by, contrast, in, 1713, the, 2nd, edition, of, isaac, newton, s, philosophiae, naturalis, principia, mathematica, argued, that, hypotheses, have, no, place, in, experimental, philosophy, in, this, philosophy, propositions, are, deduced, from, the, phenomena, and, rendered, general, by, induction, this, passage, influenced, a, later, generation, of, philosophically, inclined, readers, to, pronounce, a, ban, on, causal, hypotheses, in, natural, philosophy, in, particular, later, in, the, 18th, century, david, hume, would, famously, articulate, skepticism, about, the, ability, of, science, to, determine, causality, and, gave, a, definitive, formulation, of, the, problem, of, induction, though, both, theses, would, be, contested, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, by, immanuel, kant, in, his, critique, of, pure, reason, and, metaphysical, foundations, of, natural, science, in, 19th, century, auguste, comte, made, a, major, contribution, to, the, theory, of, science, the, 19th, century, writings, of, john, stuart, mill, are, also, considered, important, in, the, formation, of, current, conceptions, of, the, scientific, method, as, well, as, anticipating, later, accounts, of, scientific, explanation, instrumentalism, became, popular, among, physicists, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, after, which, logical, positivism, defined, the, field, for, several, decades, logical, positivism, accepts, only, testable, statements, as, meaningful, rejects, metaphysical, interpretations, and, embraces, verificationism, a, set, of, theories, of, knowledge, that, combines, logicism, empiricism, and, linguistics, to, ground, philosophy, on, a, basis, consistent, with, examples, from, the, empirical, sciences, seeking, to, overhaul, all, of, philosophy, and, convert, it, to, a, new, scientific, philosophy, the, berlin, circle, and, the, vienna, circle, propounded, logical, positivism, in, the, late, 1920s, interpreting, ludwig, wittgenstein, s, early, philosophy, of, language, logical, positivists, identified, a, verifiability, principle, or, criterion, of, cognitive, meaningfulness, from, bertrand, russell, s, logicism, they, sought, reduction, of, mathematics, to, logic, they, also, embraced, russell, s, logical, atomism, ernst, mach, s, phenomenalism, whereby, the, mind, knows, only, actual, or, potential, sensory, experience, which, is, the, content, of, all, sciences, whether, physics, or, psychology, and, percy, bridgman, s, operationalism, thereby, only, the, verifiable, was, scientific, and, cognitively, meaningful, whereas, the, unverifiable, was, unscientific, cognitively, meaningless, pseudostatements, metaphysical, emotive, or, such, not, worthy, of, further, review, by, philosophers, who, were, newly, tasked, to, organize, knowledge, rather, than, develop, new, knowledge, logical, positivism, is, commonly, portrayed, as, taking, the, extreme, position, that, scientific, language, should, never, refer, to, anything, unobservable, even, the, seemingly, core, notions, of, causality, mechanism, and, principles, but, that, is, an, exaggeration, talk, of, such, unobservables, could, be, allowed, as, metaphorical, direct, observations, viewed, in, the, abstract, or, at, worst, metaphysical, or, emotional, theoretical, laws, would, be, reduced, to, empirical, laws, while, theoretical, terms, would, garner, meaning, from, observational, terms, via, correspondence, rules, mathematics, in, physics, would, reduce, to, symbolic, logic, via, logicism, while, rational, reconstruction, would, convert, ordinary, language, into, standardized, equivalents, all, networked, and, united, by, a, logical, syntax, a, scientific, theory, would, be, stated, with, its, method, of, verification, whereby, a, logical, calculus, or, empirical, operation, could, verify, its, falsity, or, truth, in, the, late, 1930s, logical, positivists, fled, germany, and, austria, for, britain, and, america, by, then, many, had, replaced, mach, s, phenomenalism, with, otto, neurath, s, physicalism, and, rudolf, carnap, had, sought, to, replace, verification, with, simply, confirmation, with, world, war, ii, s, close, in, 1945, logical, positivism, became, milder, logical, empiricism, led, largely, by, carl, hempel, in, america, who, expounded, the, covering, law, model, of, scientific, explanation, as, a, way, of, identifying, the, logical, form, of, explanations, without, any, reference, to, the, suspect, notion, of, causation, the, logical, positivist, movement, became, a, major, underpinning, of, analytic, philosophy, and, dominated, anglosphere, philosophy, including, philosophy, of, science, while, influencing, sciences, into, the, 1960s, yet, the, movement, failed, to, resolve, its, central, problems, and, its, doctrines, were, increasingly, assaulted, nevertheless, it, brought, about, the, establishment, of, philosophy, of, science, as, a, distinct, subdiscipline, of, philosophy, with, carl, hempel, playing, a, key, role, in, the, 1962, book, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, thomas, kuhn, argued, that, the, process, of, observation, and, evaluation, takes, place, within, a, paradigm, a, logically, consistent, portrait, of, the, world, that, is, consistent, with, observations, made, from, its, framing, a, paradigm, also, encompasses, the, set, of, questions, and, practices, that, define, a, scientific, discipline, he, characterized, normal, science, as, the, process, of, observation, and, puzzle, solving, which, takes, place, within, a, paradigm, whereas, revolutionary, science, occurs, when, one, paradigm, overtakes, another, in, a, paradigm, shift, kuhn, denied, that, it, is, ever, possible, to, isolate, the, hypothesis, being, tested, from, the, influence, of, the, theory, in, which, the, observations, are, grounded, and, he, argued, that, it, is, not, possible, to, evaluate, competing, paradigms, independently, more, than, one, logically, consistent, construct, can, paint, a, usable, likeness, of, the, world, but, there, is, no, common, ground, from, which, to, pit, two, against, each, other, theory, against, theory, each, paradigm, has, its, own, distinct, questions, aims, and, interpretations, neither, provides, a, standard, by, which, the, other, can, be, judged, so, there, is, no, clear, way, to, measure, scientific, progress, across, paradigms, for, kuhn, the, choice, of, paradigm, was, sustained, by, rational, processes, but, not, ultimately, determined, by, them, the, choice, between, paradigms, involves, setting, two, or, more, portraits, against, the, world, and, deciding, which, likeness, is, most, promising, for, kuhn, acceptance, or, rejection, of, a, paradigm, is, a, social, process, as, much, as, a, logical, process, kuhn, s, position, however, is, not, one, of, relativism, according, to, kuhn, a, paradigm, shift, occurs, when, a, significant, number, of, observational, anomalies, arise, in, the, old, paradigm, and, a, new, paradigm, makes, sense, of, them, that, is, the, choice, of, a, new, paradigm, is, based, on, observations, even, though, those, observations, are, made, against, the, background, of, the, old, paradigm, according, to, robert, priddy, all, scientific, study, inescapably, builds, on, at, least, some, essential, assumptions, that, cannot, be, tested, by, scientific, processes, that, is, that, scientists, must, start, with, some, assumptions, as, to, the, ultimate, analysis, of, the, facts, with, which, it, deals, these, assumptions, would, then, be, justified, partly, by, their, adherence, to, the, types, of, occurrence, of, which, we, are, directly, conscious, and, partly, by, their, success, in, representing, the, observed, facts, with, a, certain, generality, devoid, of, ad, hoc, suppositions, kuhn, also, claims, that, all, science, is, based, on, assumptions, about, the, character, of, the, universe, rather, than, merely, on, empirical, facts, these, assumptions, a, paradigm, comprise, a, collection, of, beliefs, values, and, techniques, that, are, held, by, a, given, scientific, community, which, legitimize, their, systems, and, set, the, limitations, to, their, investigation, for, naturalists, nature, is, the, only, reality, the, correct, paradigm, and, there, is, no, such, thing, as, supernatural, i, e, anything, above, beyond, or, outside, of, nature, the, scientific, method, is, to, be, used, to, investigate, all, reality, including, the, human, spirit, some, claim, that, naturalism, is, the, implicit, philosophy, of, working, scientists, and, that, the, following, basic, assumptions, are, needed, to, justify, the, scientific, method, in, contrast, to, the, view, that, science, rests, on, foundational, assumptions, coherentism, asserts, that, statements, are, justified, by, being, a, part, of, a, coherent, system, or, rather, individual, statements, cannot, be, validated, on, their, own, only, coherent, systems, can, be, justified, a, prediction, of, a, transit, of, venus, is, justified, by, its, being, coherent, with, broader, beliefs, about, celestial, mechanics, and, earlier, observations, as, explained, above, observation, is, a, cognitive, act, that, is, it, relies, on, a, pre, existing, understanding, a, systematic, set, of, beliefs, an, observation, of, a, transit, of, venus, requires, a, huge, range, of, auxiliary, beliefs, such, as, those, that, describe, the, optics, of, telescopes, the, mechanics, of, the, telescope, mount, and, an, understanding, of, celestial, mechanics, if, the, prediction, fails, and, a, transit, is, not, observed, that, is, likely, to, occasion, an, adjustment, in, the, system, a, change, in, some, auxiliary, assumption, rather, than, a, rejection, of, the, theoretical, system, in, fact, according, to, the, duhem, quine, thesis, after, pierre, duhem, and, w, v, quine, it, is, impossible, to, test, a, theory, in, isolation, one, must, always, add, auxiliary, hypotheses, in, order, to, make, testable, predictions, for, example, to, test, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, in, the, solar, system, one, needs, information, about, the, masses, and, positions, of, the, sun, and, all, the, planets, famously, the, failure, to, predict, the, orbit, of, uranus, in, the, 19th, century, led, not, to, the, rejection, of, newton, s, law, but, rather, to, the, rejection, of, the, hypothesis, that, the, solar, system, comprises, only, seven, planets, the, investigations, that, followed, led, to, the, discovery, of, an, eighth, planet, neptune, if, a, test, fails, something, is, wrong, but, there, is, a, problem, in, figuring, out, what, that, something, is, a, missing, planet, badly, calibrated, test, equipment, an, unsuspected, curvature, of, space, or, something, else, one, consequence, of, the, duhem, quine, thesis, is, that, one, can, make, any, theory, compatible, with, any, empirical, observation, by, the, addition, of, a, sufficient, number, of, suitable, ad, hoc, hypotheses, karl, popper, accepted, this, thesis, leading, him, to, reject, na, ve, falsification, instead, he, favored, a, survival, of, the, fittest, view, in, which, the, most, falsifiable, scientific, theories, are, to, be, preferred, paul, feyerabend, 1924, 1994, argued, that, no, description, of, scientific, method, could, possibly, be, broad, enough, to, include, all, the, approaches, and, methods, used, by, scientists, and, that, there, are, no, useful, and, exception, free, methodological, rules, governing, the, progress, of, science, he, argued, that, the, only, principle, that, does, not, inhibit, progress, is, anything, goes, feyerabend, said, that, science, started, as, a, liberating, movement, but, that, over, time, it, had, become, increasingly, dogmatic, and, rigid, and, had, some, oppressive, features, and, thus, had, become, increasingly, an, ideology, because, of, this, he, said, it, was, impossible, to, come, up, with, an, unambiguous, way, to, distinguish, science, from, religion, magic, or, mythology, he, saw, the, exclusive, dominance, of, science, as, a, means, of, directing, society, as, authoritarian, and, ungrounded, promulgation, of, this, epistemological, anarchism, earned, feyerabend, the, title, of, the, worst, enemy, of, science, from, his, detractors, according, to, kuhn, science, is, an, inherently, communal, activity, which, can, only, be, done, as, part, of, a, community, for, him, the, fundamental, difference, between, science, and, other, disciplines, is, the, way, in, which, the, communities, function, others, especially, feyerabend, and, some, post, modernist, thinkers, have, argued, that, there, is, insufficient, difference, between, social, practices, in, science, and, other, disciplines, to, maintain, this, distinction, for, them, social, factors, play, an, important, and, direct, role, in, scientific, method, but, they, do, not, serve, to, differentiate, science, from, other, disciplines, on, this, account, science, is, socially, constructed, though, this, does, not, necessarily, imply, the, more, radical, notion, that, reality, itself, is, a, social, construct, michel, foucault, sought, to, analyze, and, uncover, how, disciplines, within, the, social, sciences, developed, and, adopted, the, methodologies, used, by, their, practitioners, in, works, like, the, archaeology, of, knowledge, he, used, the, term, human, sciences, the, human, sciences, do, not, comprise, mainstream, academic, disciplines, they, are, rather, an, interdisciplinary, space, for, the, reflection, on, man, who, is, the, subject, of, more, mainstream, scientific, knowledge, taken, now, as, an, object, sitting, between, these, more, conventional, areas, and, of, course, associating, with, disciplines, such, as, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and, even, history, rejecting, the, realist, view, of, scientific, inquiry, foucault, argued, throughout, his, work, that, scientific, discourse, is, not, simply, an, objective, study, of, phenomena, as, both, natural, and, social, scientists, like, to, believe, but, is, rather, the, product, of, systems, of, power, relations, struggling, to, construct, scientific, disciplines, and, knowledge, within, given, societies, with, the, advances, of, scientific, disciplines, such, as, psychology, and, anthropology, the, need, to, separate, categorize, normalize, and, institutionalize, populations, into, constructed, social, identities, became, a, staple, of, the, sciences, constructions, of, what, were, considered, normal, and, abnormal, stigmatized, and, ostracized, groups, of, people, like, the, mentally, ill, and, sexual, and, gender, minorities, however, some, such, as, quine, do, maintain, that, scientific, reality, is, a, social, construct, physical, objects, are, conceptually, imported, into, the, situation, as, convenient, intermediaries, not, by, definition, in, terms, of, experience, but, simply, as, irreducible, posits, comparable, epistemologically, to, the, gods, of, homer, for, my, part, i, do, qua, lay, physicist, believe, in, physical, objects, and, not, in, homer, s, gods, and, i, consider, it, a, scientific, error, to, believe, otherwise, but, in, point, of, epistemological, footing, the, physical, objects, and, the, gods, differ, only, in, degree, and, not, in, kind, both, sorts, of, entities, enter, our, conceptions, only, as, cultural, posits, the, public, backlash, of, scientists, against, such, views, particularly, in, the, 1990s, became, known, as, the, science, wars, a, major, development, in, recent, decades, has, been, the, study, of, the, formation, structure, and, evolution, of, scientific, communities, by, sociologists, and, anthropologists, including, david, bloor, harry, collins, bruno, latour, ian, hacking, and, anselm, strauss, concepts, and, methods, such, as, rational, choice, social, choice, or, game, theory, from, economics, have, also, been, applied, for, understanding, the, efficiency, of, scientific, communities, in, the, production, of, knowledge, this, interdisciplinary, field, has, come, to, be, known, as, science, and, technology, studies, here, the, approach, to, the, philosophy, of, science, is, to, study, how, scientific, communities, actually, operate, philosophers, in, the, continental, philosophical, tradition, are, not, traditionally, categorized, as, philosophers, of, science, however, they, have, much, to, say, about, science, some, of, which, has, anticipated, themes, in, the, analytical, tradition, for, example, in, the, genealogy, of, morals, 1887, friedrich, nietzsche, advanced, the, thesis, that, the, motive, for, the, search, for, truth, in, sciences, is, a, kind, of, ascetic, ideal, in, general, continental, philosophy, views, science, from, a, world, historical, perspective, philosophers, such, as, pierre, duhem, 1861, 1916, and, gaston, bachelard, 1884, 1962, wrote, their, works, with, this, world, historical, approach, to, science, predating, kuhn, s, 1962, work, by, a, generation, or, more, all, of, these, approaches, involve, a, historical, and, sociological, turn, to, science, with, a, priority, on, lived, experience, a, kind, of, husserlian, life, world, rather, than, a, progress, based, or, anti, historical, approach, as, emphasised, in, the, analytic, tradition, one, can, trace, this, continental, strand, of, thought, through, the, phenomenology, of, edmund, husserl, 1859, 1938, the, late, works, of, merleau, ponty, nature, course, notes, from, the, coll, ge, de, france, 1956, 1960, and, the, hermeneutics, of, martin, heidegger, 1889, 1976, the, largest, effect, on, the, continental, tradition, with, respect, to, science, came, from, martin, heidegger, s, critique, of, the, theoretical, attitude, in, general, which, of, course, includes, the, scientific, attitude, for, this, reason, the, continental, tradition, has, remained, much, more, skeptical, of, the, importance, of, science, in, human, life, and, in, philosophical, inquiry, nonetheless, there, have, been, a, number, of, important, works, especially, those, of, a, kuhnian, precursor, alexandre, koyr, 1892, 1964, another, important, development, was, that, of, michel, foucault, s, analysis, of, historical, and, scientific, thought, in, the, order, of, things, 1966, and, his, study, of, power, and, corruption, within, the, science, of, madness, post, heideggerian, authors, contributing, to, continental, philosophy, of, science, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, include, j, rgen, habermas, e, g, truth, and, justification, 1998, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, the, unity, of, nature, 1980, german, die, einheit, der, natur, 1971, and, wolfgang, stegm, ller, probleme, und, resultate, der, wissenschaftstheorie, und, analytischen, philosophie, 1973, 1986, analysis, involves, breaking, an, observation, or, theory, down, into, simpler, concepts, in, order, to, understand, it, reductionism, can, refer, to, one, of, several, philosophical, positions, related, to, this, approach, one, type, of, reductionism, suggests, that, phenomena, are, amenable, to, scientific, explanation, at, lower, levels, of, analysis, and, inquiry, perhaps, a, historical, event, might, be, explained, in, sociological, and, psychological, terms, which, in, turn, might, be, described, in, terms, of, human, physiology, which, in, turn, might, be, described, in, terms, of, chemistry, and, physics, daniel, dennett, distinguishes, legitimate, reductionism, from, what, he, calls, greedy, reductionism, which, denies, real, complexities, and, leaps, too, quickly, to, sweeping, generalizations, a, broad, issue, affecting, the, neutrality, of, science, concerns, the, areas, which, science, chooses, to, explore, that, is, what, part, of, the, world, and, of, humankind, are, studied, by, science, philip, kitcher, in, his, science, truth, and, democracy, argues, that, scientific, studies, that, attempt, to, show, one, segment, of, the, population, as, being, less, intelligent, less, successful, or, emotionally, backward, compared, to, others, have, a, political, feedback, effect, which, further, excludes, such, groups, from, access, to, science, thus, such, studies, undermine, the, broad, consensus, required, for, good, science, by, excluding, certain, people, and, so, proving, themselves, in, the, end, to, be, unscientific, there, is, no, such, thing, as, philosophy, free, science, there, is, only, science, whose, philosophical, baggage, is, taken, on, board, without, examination, in, addition, to, addressing, the, general, questions, regarding, science, and, induction, many, philosophers, of, science, are, occupied, by, investigating, foundational, problems, in, particular, sciences, they, also, examine, the, implications, of, particular, sciences, for, broader, philosophical, questions, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, has, seen, a, rise, in, the, number, of, practitioners, of, philosophy, of, a, particular, science, the, problem, of, induction, discussed, above, is, seen, in, another, form, in, debates, over, the, foundations, of, statistics, the, standard, approach, to, statistical, hypothesis, testing, avoids, claims, about, whether, evidence, supports, a, hypothesis, or, makes, it, more, probable, instead, the, typical, test, yields, a, p, value, which, is, the, probability, of, the, evidence, being, such, as, it, is, under, the, assumption, that, the, hypothesis, being, tested, is, true, if, the, p, value, is, too, low, the, hypothesis, is, rejected, in, a, way, analogous, to, falsification, in, contrast, bayesian, inference, seeks, to, assign, probabilities, to, hypotheses, related, topics, in, philosophy, of, statistics, include, probability, interpretations, overfitting, and, the, difference, between, correlation, and, causation, philosophy, of, mathematics, is, concerned, with, the, philosophical, foundations, and, implications, of, mathematics, the, central, questions, are, whether, numbers, triangles, and, other, mathematical, entities, exist, independently, of, the, human, mind, and, what, is, the, nature, of, mathematical, propositions, is, asking, whether, 1, 1, 2, is, true, fundamentally, different, from, asking, whether, a, ball, is, red, was, calculus, invented, or, discovered, a, related, question, is, whether, learning, mathematics, requires, experience, or, reason, alone, what, does, it, mean, to, prove, a, mathematical, theorem, and, how, does, one, know, whether, a, mathematical, proof, is, correct, philosophers, of, mathematics, also, aim, to, clarify, the, relationships, between, mathematics, and, logic, human, capabilities, such, as, intuition, and, the, material, universe, philosophy, of, physics, is, the, study, of, the, fundamental, philosophical, questions, underlying, modern, physics, the, study, of, matter, and, energy, and, how, they, interact, the, main, questions, concern, the, nature, of, space, and, time, atoms, and, atomism, also, included, are, the, predictions, of, cosmology, the, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, foundations, of, statistical, mechanics, causality, determinism, and, the, nature, of, physical, laws, classically, several, of, these, questions, were, studied, as, part, of, metaphysics, for, example, those, about, causality, determinism, and, space, and, time, philosophy, of, chemistry, is, the, philosophical, study, of, the, methodology, and, content, of, the, science, of, chemistry, it, is, explored, by, philosophers, chemists, and, philosopher, chemist, teams, it, includes, research, on, general, philosophy, of, science, issues, as, applied, to, chemistry, for, example, can, all, chemical, phenomena, be, explained, by, quantum, mechanics, or, is, it, not, possible, to, reduce, chemistry, to, physics, for, another, example, chemists, have, discussed, the, philosophy, of, how, theories, are, confirmed, in, the, context, of, confirming, reaction, mechanisms, determining, reaction, mechanisms, is, difficult, because, they, cannot, be, observed, directly, chemists, can, use, a, number, of, indirect, measures, as, evidence, to, rule, out, certain, mechanisms, but, they, are, often, unsure, if, the, remaining, mechanism, is, correct, because, there, are, many, other, possible, mechanisms, that, they, have, not, tested, or, even, thought, of, philosophers, have, also, sought, to, clarify, the, meaning, of, chemical, concepts, which, do, not, refer, to, specific, physical, entities, such, as, chemical, bonds, the, philosophy, of, astronomy, seeks, to, understand, and, analyze, the, methodologies, and, technologies, used, by, experts, in, the, discipline, focusing, on, how, observations, made, about, space, and, astrophysical, phenomena, can, be, studied, given, that, astronomers, rely, and, use, theories, and, formulas, from, other, scientific, disciplines, such, as, chemistry, and, physics, the, pursuit, of, understanding, how, knowledge, can, be, obtained, about, the, cosmos, as, well, as, the, relation, in, which, our, planet, and, solar, system, have, within, our, personal, views, of, our, place, in, the, universe, philosophical, insights, into, how, facts, about, space, can, be, scientifically, analyzed, and, configure, with, other, established, knowledge, is, a, main, point, of, inquiry, the, philosophy, of, earth, science, is, concerned, with, how, humans, obtain, and, verify, knowledge, of, the, workings, of, the, earth, system, including, the, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and, geosphere, solid, earth, earth, scientists, ways, of, knowing, and, habits, of, mind, share, important, commonalities, with, other, sciences, but, also, have, distinctive, attributes, that, emerge, from, the, complex, heterogeneous, unique, long, lived, and, non, manipulatable, nature, of, the, earth, system, philosophy, of, biology, deals, with, epistemological, metaphysical, and, ethical, issues, in, the, biological, and, biomedical, sciences, although, philosophers, of, science, and, philosophers, generally, have, long, been, interested, in, biology, e, g, aristotle, descartes, leibniz, and, even, kant, philosophy, of, biology, only, emerged, as, an, independent, field, of, philosophy, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, philosophers, of, science, began, to, pay, increasing, attention, to, developments, in, biology, from, the, rise, of, the, modern, synthesis, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, to, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, in, 1953, to, more, recent, advances, in, genetic, engineering, other, key, ideas, such, as, the, reduction, of, all, life, processes, to, biochemical, reactions, as, well, as, the, incorporation, of, psychology, into, a, broader, neuroscience, are, also, addressed, research, in, current, philosophy, of, biology, includes, investigation, of, the, foundations, of, evolutionary, theory, such, as, peter, godfrey, smith, s, work, and, the, role, of, viruses, as, persistent, symbionts, in, host, genomes, as, a, consequence, the, evolution, of, genetic, content, order, is, seen, as, the, result, of, competent, genome, editors, in, contrast, to, former, narratives, in, which, error, replication, events, mutations, dominated, beyond, medical, ethics, and, bioethics, the, philosophy, of, medicine, is, a, branch, of, philosophy, that, includes, the, epistemology, and, ontology, metaphysics, of, medicine, within, the, epistemology, of, medicine, evidence, based, medicine, ebm, or, evidence, based, practice, ebp, has, attracted, attention, most, notably, the, roles, of, randomisation, blinding, and, placebo, controls, related, to, these, areas, of, investigation, ontologies, of, specific, interest, to, the, philosophy, of, medicine, include, cartesian, dualism, the, monogenetic, conception, of, disease, and, the, conceptualization, of, placebos, and, placebo, effects, there, is, also, a, growing, interest, in, the, metaphysics, of, medicine, particularly, the, idea, of, causation, philosophers, of, medicine, might, not, only, be, interested, in, how, medical, knowledge, is, generated, but, also, in, the, nature, of, such, phenomena, causation, is, of, interest, because, the, purpose, of, much, medical, research, is, to, establish, causal, relationships, e, g, what, causes, disease, or, what, causes, people, to, get, better, philosophy, of, psychiatry, explores, philosophical, questions, relating, to, psychiatry, and, mental, illness, the, philosopher, of, science, and, medicine, dominic, murphy, identifies, three, areas, of, exploration, in, the, philosophy, of, psychiatry, the, first, concerns, the, examination, of, psychiatry, as, a, science, using, the, tools, of, the, philosophy, of, science, more, broadly, the, second, entails, the, examination, of, the, concepts, employed, in, discussion, of, mental, illness, including, the, experience, of, mental, illness, and, the, normative, questions, it, raises, the, third, area, concerns, the, links, and, discontinuities, between, the, philosophy, of, mind, and, psychopathology, philosophy, of, psychology, refers, to, issues, at, the, theoretical, foundations, of, modern, psychology, some, of, these, issues, are, epistemological, concerns, about, the, methodology, of, psychological, investigation, for, example, is, the, best, method, for, studying, psychology, to, focus, only, on, the, response, of, behavior, to, external, stimuli, or, should, psychologists, focus, on, mental, perception, and, thought, processes, if, the, latter, an, important, question, is, how, the, internal, experiences, of, others, can, be, measured, self, reports, of, feelings, and, beliefs, may, not, be, reliable, because, even, in, cases, in, which, there, is, no, apparent, incentive, for, subjects, to, intentionally, deceive, in, their, answers, self, deception, or, selective, memory, may, affect, their, responses, then, even, in, the, case, of, accurate, self, reports, how, can, responses, be, compared, across, individuals, even, if, two, individuals, respond, with, the, same, answer, on, a, likert, scale, they, may, be, experiencing, very, different, things, other, issues, in, philosophy, of, psychology, are, philosophical, questions, about, the, nature, of, mind, brain, and, cognition, and, are, perhaps, more, commonly, thought, of, as, part, of, cognitive, science, or, philosophy, of, mind, for, example, are, humans, rational, creatures, is, there, any, sense, in, which, they, have, free, will, and, how, does, that, relate, to, the, experience, of, making, choices, philosophy, of, psychology, also, closely, monitors, contemporary, work, conducted, in, cognitive, neuroscience, psycholinguistics, and, artificial, intelligence, questioning, what, they, can, and, cannot, explain, in, psychology, philosophy, of, psychology, is, a, relatively, young, field, because, psychology, only, became, a, discipline, of, its, own, in, the, late, 1800s, in, particular, neurophilosophy, has, just, recently, become, its, own, field, with, the, works, of, paul, churchland, and, patricia, churchland, philosophy, of, mind, by, contrast, has, been, a, well, established, discipline, since, before, psychology, was, a, field, of, study, at, all, it, is, concerned, with, questions, about, the, very, nature, of, mind, the, qualities, of, experience, and, particular, issues, like, the, debate, between, dualism, and, monism, the, philosophy, of, social, science, is, the, study, of, the, logic, and, method, of, the, social, sciences, such, as, sociology, and, cultural, anthropology, philosophers, of, social, science, are, concerned, with, the, differences, and, similarities, between, the, social, and, the, natural, sciences, causal, relationships, between, social, phenomena, the, possible, existence, of, social, laws, and, the, ontological, significance, of, structure, and, agency, the, french, philosopher, auguste, comte, 1798, 1857, established, the, epistemological, perspective, of, positivism, in, the, course, in, positivist, philosophy, a, series, of, texts, published, between, 1830, and, 1842, the, first, three, volumes, of, the, course, dealt, chiefly, with, the, natural, sciences, already, in, existence, geoscience, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, whereas, the, latter, two, emphasised, the, inevitable, coming, of, social, science, sociologie, for, comte, the, natural, sciences, had, to, necessarily, arrive, first, before, humanity, could, adequately, channel, its, efforts, into, the, most, challenging, and, complex, queen, science, of, human, society, itself, comte, offers, an, evolutionary, system, proposing, that, society, undergoes, three, phases, in, its, quest, for, the, truth, according, to, a, general, law, of, three, stages, these, are, 1, the, theological, 2, the, metaphysical, and, 3, the, positive, comte, s, positivism, established, the, initial, philosophical, foundations, for, formal, sociology, and, social, research, durkheim, marx, and, weber, are, more, typically, cited, as, the, fathers, of, contemporary, social, science, in, psychology, a, positivistic, approach, has, historically, been, favoured, in, behaviourism, positivism, has, also, been, espoused, by, technocrats, who, believe, in, the, inevitability, of, social, progress, through, science, and, technology, the, positivist, perspective, has, been, associated, with, scientism, the, view, that, the, methods, of, the, natural, sciences, may, be, applied, to, all, areas, of, investigation, be, it, philosophical, social, scientific, or, otherwise, among, most, social, scientists, and, historians, orthodox, positivism, has, long, since, lost, popular, support, today, practitioners, of, both, social, and, physical, sciences, instead, take, into, account, the, distorting, effect, of, observer, bias, and, structural, limitations, this, scepticism, has, been, facilitated, by, a, general, weakening, of, deductivist, accounts, of, science, by, philosophers, such, as, thomas, kuhn, and, new, philosophical, movements, such, as, critical, realism, and, neopragmatism, the, philosopher, sociologist, j, rgen, habermas, has, critiqued, pure, instrumental, rationality, as, meaning, that, scientific, thinking, becomes, something, akin, to, ideology, itself, the, philosophy, of, technology, is, a, sub, field, of, philosophy, that, studies, the, nature, of, technology, specific, research, topics, include, study, of, the, role, of, tacit, and, explicit, knowledge, in, creating, and, using, technology, the, nature, of, functions, in, technological, artifacts, the, role, of, values, in, design, and, ethics, related, to, technology, technology, and, engineering, can, both, involve, the, application, of, scientific, knowledge, the, philosophy, of, engineering, is, an, emerging, sub, field, of, the, broader, philosophy, of, technology
