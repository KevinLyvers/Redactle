epistemology, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, that, examines, the, nature, origin, and, limits, of, knowledge, also, called, theory, of, knowledge, it, explores, different, types, of, knowledge, such, as, propositional, knowledge, about, facts, practical, knowledge, in, the, form, of, skills, and, knowledge, by, acquaintance, as, a, familiarity, through, experience, epistemologists, study, the, concepts, of, belief, truth, and, justification, to, understand, the, nature, of, knowledge, to, discover, how, knowledge, arises, they, investigate, sources, of, justification, such, as, perception, introspection, memory, reason, and, testimony, the, school, of, skepticism, questions, the, human, ability, to, attain, knowledge, while, fallibilism, says, that, knowledge, is, never, certain, empiricists, hold, that, all, knowledge, comes, from, sense, experience, whereas, rationalists, believe, that, some, knowledge, does, not, depend, on, it, coherentists, argue, that, a, belief, is, justified, if, it, coheres, with, other, beliefs, foundationalists, by, contrast, maintain, that, the, justification, of, basic, beliefs, does, not, depend, on, other, beliefs, internalism, and, externalism, disagree, about, whether, justification, is, determined, solely, by, mental, states, or, also, by, external, circumstances, separate, branches, of, epistemology, are, dedicated, to, knowledge, found, in, specific, fields, like, scientific, mathematical, moral, and, religious, knowledge, naturalized, epistemology, relies, on, empirical, methods, and, discoveries, whereas, formal, epistemology, uses, formal, tools, from, logic, social, epistemology, investigates, the, communal, aspect, of, knowledge, and, historical, epistemology, examines, its, historical, conditions, epistemology, is, closely, related, to, psychology, which, describes, the, beliefs, people, hold, while, epistemology, studies, the, norms, governing, the, evaluation, of, beliefs, it, also, intersects, with, fields, such, as, decision, theory, education, and, anthropology, early, reflections, on, the, nature, sources, and, scope, of, knowledge, are, found, in, ancient, greek, indian, and, chinese, philosophy, the, relation, between, reason, and, faith, was, a, central, topic, in, the, medieval, period, the, modern, era, was, characterized, by, the, contrasting, perspectives, of, empiricism, and, rationalism, epistemologists, in, the, 20th, century, examined, the, components, structure, and, value, of, knowledge, while, integrating, insights, from, the, natural, sciences, and, linguistics, epistemology, is, the, philosophical, study, of, knowledge, also, called, theory, of, knowledge, it, examines, what, knowledge, is, and, what, types, of, knowledge, there, are, it, further, investigates, the, sources, of, knowledge, like, perception, inference, and, testimony, to, determine, how, knowledge, is, created, another, topic, is, the, extent, and, limits, of, knowledge, confronting, questions, about, what, people, can, and, cannot, know, other, central, concepts, include, belief, truth, justification, evidence, and, reason, epistemology, is, one, of, the, main, branches, of, philosophy, besides, fields, like, ethics, logic, and, metaphysics, the, term, is, also, used, in, a, slightly, different, sense, to, refer, not, to, the, branch, of, philosophy, but, to, a, particular, position, within, that, branch, as, in, plato, s, epistemology, and, immanuel, kant, s, epistemology, as, a, normative, field, of, inquiry, epistemology, explores, how, people, should, acquire, beliefs, this, way, it, determines, which, beliefs, fulfill, the, standards, or, epistemic, goals, of, knowledge, and, which, ones, fail, thereby, providing, an, evaluation, of, beliefs, descriptive, fields, of, inquiry, like, psychology, and, cognitive, sociology, are, also, interested, in, beliefs, and, related, cognitive, processes, unlike, epistemology, they, study, the, beliefs, people, have, and, how, people, acquire, them, instead, of, examining, the, evaluative, norms, of, these, processes, epistemology, is, relevant, to, many, descriptive, and, normative, disciplines, such, as, the, other, branches, of, philosophy, and, the, sciences, by, exploring, the, principles, of, how, they, may, arrive, at, knowledge, the, word, epistemology, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, terms, episteme, meaning, knowledge, or, understanding, and, logos, meaning, study, of, or, reason, literally, the, study, of, knowledge, yet, even, though, ancient, greek, philosophers, practiced, what, is, today, considered, epistemology, they, did, not, understand, their, investigations, in, these, terms, the, word, was, only, coined, in, the, 19th, century, to, label, this, field, and, conceive, it, as, a, distinct, branch, of, philosophy, knowledge, is, an, awareness, familiarity, understanding, or, skill, its, various, forms, all, involve, a, cognitive, success, through, which, a, person, establishes, epistemic, contact, with, reality, knowledge, is, typically, understood, as, an, aspect, of, individuals, generally, as, a, cognitive, mental, state, that, helps, them, understand, interpret, and, interact, with, the, world, while, this, core, sense, is, of, particular, interest, to, epistemologists, the, term, also, has, other, meanings, understood, on, a, social, level, knowledge, is, a, characteristic, of, a, group, of, people, that, share, ideas, understanding, or, culture, in, general, the, term, can, also, refer, to, information, stored, in, documents, such, as, knowledge, housed, in, the, library, or, knowledge, stored, in, computers, in, the, form, of, the, knowledge, base, of, an, expert, system, knowledge, contrasts, with, ignorance, which, is, often, simply, defined, as, the, absence, of, knowledge, knowledge, is, usually, accompanied, by, ignorance, since, people, rarely, have, complete, knowledge, of, a, field, forcing, them, to, rely, on, incomplete, or, uncertain, information, when, making, decisions, even, though, many, forms, of, ignorance, can, be, mitigated, through, education, and, research, there, are, certain, limits, to, human, understanding, that, are, responsible, for, inevitable, ignorance, some, limitations, are, inherent, in, the, human, cognitive, faculties, themselves, such, as, the, inability, to, know, facts, too, complex, for, the, human, mind, to, conceive, others, depend, on, external, circumstances, when, no, access, to, the, relevant, information, exists, epistemologists, disagree, on, how, much, people, know, for, example, whether, fallible, beliefs, about, everyday, affairs, can, amount, to, knowledge, or, whether, absolute, certainty, is, required, the, most, stringent, position, is, taken, by, radical, skeptics, who, argue, that, there, is, no, knowledge, at, all, epistemologists, distinguish, between, different, types, of, knowledge, their, primary, interest, is, in, knowledge, of, facts, called, propositional, knowledge, it, is, a, theoretical, knowledge, that, can, be, expressed, in, declarative, sentences, using, a, that, clause, like, ravi, knows, that, kangaroos, hop, for, this, reason, it, is, also, called, knowledge, that, epistemologists, often, understand, it, as, a, relation, between, a, knower, and, a, known, proposition, in, the, case, above, between, the, person, ravi, and, the, proposition, kangaroos, hop, it, is, use, independent, since, it, is, not, tied, to, one, specific, purpose, it, is, a, mental, representation, that, relies, on, concepts, and, ideas, to, depict, reality, because, of, its, theoretical, nature, it, is, often, held, that, only, relatively, sophisticated, creatures, such, as, humans, possess, propositional, knowledge, propositional, knowledge, contrasts, with, non, propositional, knowledge, in, the, form, of, knowledge, how, and, knowledge, by, acquaintance, knowledge, how, is, a, practical, ability, or, skill, like, knowing, how, to, read, or, how, to, prepare, lasagna, it, is, usually, tied, to, a, specific, goal, and, not, mastered, in, the, abstract, without, concrete, practice, to, know, something, by, acquaintance, means, to, be, familiar, with, it, as, a, result, of, experiental, contact, examples, are, knowing, the, city, of, perth, knowing, the, taste, of, tsampa, and, knowing, marta, vieira, da, silva, personally, another, influential, distinction, is, between, a, posteriori, and, a, priori, knowledge, a, posteriori, knowledge, is, knowledge, of, empirical, facts, based, on, sensory, experience, like, seeing, that, the, sun, is, shining, and, smelling, that, a, piece, of, meat, has, gone, bad, knowledge, belonging, to, the, empirical, science, and, knowledge, of, everyday, affairs, belongs, to, a, posteriori, knowledge, a, priori, knowledge, is, knowledge, of, non, empirical, facts, and, does, not, depend, on, evidence, from, sensory, experience, it, belongs, to, fields, such, as, mathematics, and, logic, like, knowing, that, 2, 2, 4, displaystyle, 2, 2, 4, the, contrast, between, a, posteriori, and, a, priori, knowledge, plays, a, central, role, in, the, debate, between, empiricists, and, rationalists, on, whether, all, knowledge, depends, on, sensory, experience, a, closely, related, contrast, is, between, analytic, and, synthetic, truths, a, sentence, is, analytically, true, if, its, truth, depends, only, on, the, meaning, of, the, words, it, uses, for, instance, the, sentence, all, bachelors, are, unmarried, is, analytically, true, because, the, word, bachelor, already, includes, the, meaning, unmarried, a, sentence, is, synthetically, true, if, its, truth, depends, on, additional, facts, for, example, the, sentence, snow, is, white, is, synthetically, true, because, its, truth, depends, on, the, color, of, snow, in, addition, to, the, meanings, of, the, words, snow, and, white, a, priori, knowledge, is, primarily, associated, with, analytic, sentences, while, a, posteriori, knowledge, is, primarily, associated, with, synthetic, sentences, however, it, is, controversial, whether, this, is, true, for, all, cases, some, philosophers, such, as, willard, van, orman, quine, reject, the, distinction, saying, that, there, are, no, analytic, truths, the, analysis, of, knowledge, is, the, attempt, to, identify, the, essential, components, or, conditions, of, all, and, only, propositional, knowledge, states, according, to, the, so, called, traditional, analysis, knowledge, has, three, components, it, is, a, belief, that, is, justified, and, true, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, this, view, was, put, into, doubt, by, a, series, of, thought, experiments, that, aimed, to, show, that, some, justified, true, beliefs, do, not, amount, to, knowledge, in, one, of, them, a, person, is, unaware, of, all, the, fake, barns, in, their, area, by, coincidence, they, stop, in, front, of, the, only, real, barn, and, form, a, justified, true, belief, that, it, is, a, real, barn, many, epistemologists, agree, that, this, is, not, knowledge, because, the, justification, is, not, directly, relevant, to, the, truth, more, specifically, this, and, similar, counterexamples, involve, some, form, of, epistemic, luck, that, is, a, cognitive, success, that, results, from, fortuitous, circumstances, rather, than, competence, following, these, thought, experiments, philosophers, proposed, various, alternative, definitions, of, knowledge, by, modifying, or, expanding, the, traditional, analysis, according, to, one, view, the, known, fact, has, to, cause, the, belief, in, the, right, way, another, theory, states, that, the, belief, is, the, product, of, a, reliable, belief, formation, process, further, approaches, require, that, the, person, would, not, have, the, belief, if, it, was, false, that, the, belief, is, not, inferred, from, a, falsehood, that, the, justification, cannot, be, undermined, or, that, the, belief, is, infallible, there, is, no, consensus, on, which, of, the, proposed, modifications, and, reconceptualizations, is, correct, some, philosophers, such, as, timothy, williamson, reject, the, basic, assumption, underlying, the, analysis, of, knowledge, by, arguing, that, propositional, knowledge, is, a, unique, state, that, cannot, be, dissected, into, simpler, components, the, value, of, knowledge, is, the, worth, it, holds, by, expanding, understanding, and, guiding, action, knowledge, can, have, instrumental, value, by, helping, a, person, achieve, their, goals, for, example, knowledge, of, a, disease, helps, a, doctor, cure, their, patient, and, knowledge, of, when, a, job, interview, starts, helps, a, candidate, arrive, on, time, the, usefulness, of, a, known, fact, depends, on, the, circumstances, knowledge, of, some, facts, may, have, little, to, no, uses, like, memorizing, random, phone, numbers, from, an, outdated, phone, book, being, able, to, assess, the, value, of, knowledge, matters, in, choosing, what, information, to, acquire, and, transmit, to, others, it, affects, decisions, like, which, subjects, to, teach, at, school, and, how, to, allocate, funds, to, research, projects, of, particular, interest, to, epistemologists, is, the, question, of, whether, knowledge, is, more, valuable, than, a, mere, opinion, that, is, true, knowledge, and, true, opinion, often, have, a, similar, usefulness, since, both, are, accurate, representations, of, reality, for, example, if, a, person, wants, to, go, to, larissa, a, true, opinion, about, how, to, get, there, may, help, them, in, the, same, way, as, knowledge, does, plato, already, considered, this, problem, and, suggested, that, knowledge, is, better, because, it, is, more, stable, another, suggestion, focuses, on, practical, reasoning, it, proposes, that, people, put, more, trust, in, knowledge, than, in, mere, true, beliefs, when, drawing, conclusions, and, deciding, what, to, do, a, different, response, says, that, knowledge, has, intrinsic, value, meaning, that, it, is, good, in, itself, independent, of, its, usefulness, beliefs, are, mental, states, about, what, is, the, case, like, believing, that, snow, is, white, or, that, god, exists, in, epistemology, they, are, often, understood, as, subjective, attitudes, that, affirm, or, deny, a, proposition, which, can, be, expressed, in, a, declarative, sentence, for, instance, to, believe, that, snow, is, white, is, to, affirm, the, proposition, snow, is, white, according, to, this, view, beliefs, are, representations, of, what, the, world, is, like, they, are, kept, in, memory, and, can, be, retrieved, when, actively, thinking, about, reality, or, when, deciding, how, to, act, a, different, view, understands, beliefs, as, behavioral, patterns, or, dispositions, to, act, rather, than, as, representational, items, stored, in, the, mind, this, view, says, that, to, believe, that, there, is, mineral, water, in, the, fridge, is, nothing, more, than, a, group, of, dispositions, related, to, mineral, water, and, the, fridge, examples, are, the, dispositions, to, answer, questions, about, the, presence, of, mineral, water, affirmatively, and, to, go, to, the, fridge, when, thirsty, some, theorists, deny, the, existence, of, beliefs, saying, that, this, concept, borrowed, from, folk, psychology, is, an, oversimplification, of, much, more, complex, psychological, processes, beliefs, play, a, central, role, in, various, epistemological, debates, which, cover, their, status, as, a, component, of, propositional, knowledge, the, question, of, whether, people, have, control, over, and, are, responsible, for, their, beliefs, and, the, issue, of, whether, there, are, degrees, of, beliefs, called, credences, as, propositional, attitudes, beliefs, are, true, or, false, depending, on, whether, they, affirm, a, true, or, a, false, proposition, according, to, the, correspondence, theory, of, truth, to, be, true, means, to, stand, in, the, right, relation, to, the, world, by, accurately, describing, what, it, is, like, this, means, that, truth, is, objective, a, belief, is, true, if, it, corresponds, to, a, fact, the, coherence, theory, of, truth, says, that, a, belief, is, true, if, it, belongs, to, a, coherent, system, of, beliefs, a, result, of, this, view, is, that, truth, is, relative, since, it, depends, on, other, beliefs, further, theories, of, truth, include, pragmatist, semantic, pluralist, and, deflationary, theories, truth, plays, a, central, role, in, epistemology, as, a, goal, of, cognitive, processes, and, a, component, of, propositional, knowledge, in, epistemology, justification, is, a, property, of, beliefs, that, fulfill, certain, norms, about, what, a, person, should, believe, according, to, a, common, view, this, means, that, the, person, has, sufficient, reasons, for, holding, this, belief, because, they, have, information, that, supports, it, another, view, states, that, a, belief, is, justified, if, it, is, formed, by, a, reliable, belief, formation, process, such, as, perception, the, terms, reasonable, warranted, and, supported, are, closely, related, to, the, idea, of, justification, and, are, sometimes, used, as, synonyms, justification, is, what, distinguishes, justified, beliefs, from, superstition, and, lucky, guesses, however, justification, does, not, guarantee, truth, for, example, if, a, person, has, strong, but, misleading, evidence, they, may, form, a, justified, belief, that, is, false, epistemologists, often, identify, justification, as, one, component, of, knowledge, usually, they, are, not, only, interested, in, whether, a, person, has, a, sufficient, reason, to, hold, a, belief, known, as, propositional, justification, but, also, in, whether, the, person, holds, the, belief, because, or, based, on, this, reason, known, as, doxastic, justification, for, example, if, a, person, has, sufficient, reason, to, believe, that, a, neighborhood, is, dangerous, but, forms, this, belief, based, on, superstition, then, they, have, propositional, justification, but, lack, doxastic, justification, sources, of, justification, are, ways, or, cognitive, capacities, through, which, people, acquire, justification, often, discussed, sources, include, perception, introspection, memory, reason, and, testimony, but, there, is, no, universal, agreement, to, what, extent, they, all, provide, valid, justification, perception, relies, on, sensory, organs, to, gain, empirical, information, there, are, various, forms, of, perception, corresponding, to, different, physical, stimuli, such, as, visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, and, gustatory, perception, perception, is, not, merely, the, reception, of, sense, impressions, but, an, active, process, that, selects, organizes, and, interprets, sensory, signals, introspection, is, a, closely, related, process, focused, not, on, external, physical, objects, but, on, internal, mental, states, for, example, seeing, a, bus, at, a, bus, station, belongs, to, perception, while, feeling, tired, belongs, to, introspection, rationalists, understand, reason, as, a, source, of, justification, for, non, empirical, facts, it, is, often, used, to, explain, how, people, can, know, about, mathematical, logical, and, conceptual, truths, reason, is, also, responsible, for, inferential, knowledge, in, which, one, or, several, beliefs, are, used, as, premises, to, support, another, belief, memory, depends, on, information, provided, by, other, sources, which, it, retains, and, recalls, like, remembering, a, phone, number, perceived, earlier, justification, by, testimony, relies, on, information, one, person, communicates, to, another, person, this, can, happen, by, talking, to, each, other, but, can, also, occur, in, other, forms, like, a, letter, a, newspaper, and, a, blog, rationality, is, closely, related, to, justification, and, the, terms, rational, belief, and, justified, belief, are, sometimes, used, as, synonyms, however, rationality, has, a, wider, scope, that, encompasses, both, a, theoretical, side, covering, beliefs, and, a, practical, side, covering, decisions, intentions, and, actions, there, are, different, conceptions, about, what, it, means, for, something, to, be, rational, according, to, one, view, a, mental, state, is, rational, if, it, is, based, on, or, responsive, to, good, reasons, another, view, emphasizes, the, role, of, coherence, stating, that, rationality, requires, that, the, different, mental, states, of, a, person, are, consistent, and, support, each, other, a, slightly, different, approach, holds, that, rationality, is, about, achieving, certain, goals, two, goals, of, theoretical, rationality, are, accuracy, and, comprehensiveness, meaning, that, a, person, has, as, few, false, beliefs, and, as, many, true, beliefs, as, possible, epistemic, norms, are, criteria, to, assess, the, cognitive, quality, of, beliefs, like, their, justification, and, rationality, epistemologists, distinguish, between, deontic, norms, which, are, prescriptions, about, what, people, should, believe, or, which, beliefs, are, correct, and, axiological, norms, which, identify, the, goals, and, values, of, beliefs, epistemic, norms, are, closely, related, to, intellectual, or, epistemic, virtues, which, are, character, traits, like, open, mindedness, and, conscientiousness, epistemic, virtues, help, individuals, form, true, beliefs, and, acquire, knowledge, they, contrast, with, epistemic, vices, and, act, as, foundational, concepts, of, virtue, epistemology, evidence, for, a, belief, is, information, that, favors, or, supports, it, epistemologists, understand, evidence, primarily, in, terms, of, mental, states, for, example, as, sensory, impressions, or, as, other, propositions, that, a, person, knows, but, in, a, wider, sense, it, can, also, include, physical, objects, like, bloodstains, examined, by, forensic, analysts, or, financial, records, studied, by, investigative, journalists, evidence, is, often, understood, in, terms, of, probability, evidence, for, a, belief, makes, it, more, likely, that, the, belief, is, true, a, defeater, is, evidence, against, a, belief, or, evidence, that, undermines, another, piece, of, evidence, for, instance, witness, testimony, connecting, a, suspect, to, a, crime, is, evidence, for, their, guilt, while, an, alibi, is, a, defeater, evidentialists, analyze, justification, in, terms, of, evidence, by, saying, that, to, be, justified, a, belief, needs, to, rest, on, adequate, evidence, the, presence, of, evidence, usually, affects, doubt, and, certainty, which, are, subjective, attitudes, toward, propositions, that, differ, regarding, their, level, of, confidence, doubt, involves, questioning, the, validity, or, truth, of, a, proposition, certainty, by, contrast, is, a, strong, affirmative, conviction, meaning, that, the, person, is, free, of, doubt, that, the, proposition, is, true, in, epistemology, doubt, and, certainty, play, central, roles, in, attempts, to, find, a, secure, foundation, of, all, knowledge, and, in, skeptical, projects, aiming, to, establish, that, no, belief, is, immune, to, doubt, while, propositional, knowledge, is, the, main, topic, in, epistemology, some, theorists, focus, on, understanding, rather, than, knowledge, understanding, is, a, more, holistic, notion, that, involves, a, wider, grasp, of, a, subject, to, understand, something, a, person, requires, awareness, of, how, different, things, are, connected, and, why, they, are, the, way, they, are, for, example, knowledge, of, isolated, facts, memorized, from, a, textbook, does, not, amount, to, understanding, according, to, one, view, understanding, is, a, special, epistemic, good, that, unlike, knowledge, is, always, intrinsically, valuable, wisdom, is, similar, in, this, regard, and, is, sometimes, considered, the, highest, epistemic, good, it, encompasses, a, reflective, understanding, with, practical, applications, it, helps, people, grasp, and, evaluate, complex, situations, and, lead, a, good, life, philosophical, skepticism, questions, the, human, ability, to, arrive, at, knowledge, some, skeptics, limit, their, criticism, to, certain, domains, of, knowledge, for, example, religious, skeptics, say, that, it, is, impossible, to, have, certain, knowledge, about, the, existence, of, deities, or, other, religious, doctrines, similarly, moral, skeptics, challenge, the, existence, of, moral, knowledge, and, metaphysical, skeptics, say, that, humans, cannot, know, ultimate, reality, global, skepticism, is, the, widest, form, of, skepticism, asserting, that, there, is, no, knowledge, in, any, domain, in, ancient, philosophy, this, view, was, accepted, by, academic, skeptics, while, pyrrhonian, skeptics, recommended, the, suspension, of, belief, to, achieve, a, state, of, tranquility, overall, not, many, epistemologists, have, explicitly, defended, global, skepticism, the, influence, of, this, position, derives, mainly, from, attempts, by, other, philosophers, to, show, that, their, theory, overcomes, the, challenge, of, skepticism, for, example, ren, descartes, used, methodological, doubt, to, find, facts, that, cannot, be, doubted, one, consideration, in, favor, of, global, skepticism, is, the, dream, argument, it, starts, from, the, observation, that, while, people, are, dreaming, they, are, usually, unaware, of, this, this, inability, to, distinguish, between, dream, and, regular, experience, is, used, to, argue, that, there, is, no, certain, knowledge, since, a, person, can, never, be, sure, that, they, are, not, dreaming, some, critics, assert, that, global, skepticism, is, a, self, refuting, idea, because, denying, the, existence, of, knowledge, is, itself, a, knowledge, claim, another, objection, says, that, the, abstract, reasoning, leading, to, skepticism, is, not, convincing, enough, to, overrule, common, sense, fallibilism, is, another, response, to, skepticism, fallibilists, agree, with, skeptics, that, absolute, certainty, is, impossible, most, fallibilists, disagree, with, skeptics, about, the, existence, of, knowledge, saying, that, there, is, knowledge, since, it, does, not, require, absolute, certainty, they, emphasize, the, need, to, keep, an, open, and, inquisitive, mind, since, doubt, can, never, be, fully, excluded, even, for, well, established, knowledge, claims, like, thoroughly, tested, scientific, theories, epistemic, relativism, is, a, related, view, it, does, not, question, the, existence, of, knowledge, in, general, but, rejects, the, idea, that, there, are, universal, epistemic, standards, or, absolute, principles, that, apply, equally, to, everyone, this, means, that, what, a, person, knows, depends, on, the, subjective, criteria, or, social, conventions, used, to, assess, epistemic, status, the, debate, between, empiricism, and, rationalism, centers, on, the, origins, of, human, knowledge, empiricism, emphasizes, that, sense, experience, is, the, primary, source, of, all, knowledge, some, empiricists, express, this, view, by, stating, that, the, mind, is, a, blank, slate, that, only, develops, ideas, about, the, external, world, through, the, sense, data, it, receives, from, the, sensory, organs, according, to, them, the, mind, can, arrive, at, various, additional, insights, by, comparing, impressions, combining, them, generalizing, to, arrive, at, more, abstract, ideas, and, deducing, new, conclusions, from, them, empiricists, say, that, all, these, mental, operations, depend, on, material, from, the, senses, and, do, not, function, on, their, own, even, though, rationalists, usually, accept, sense, experience, as, one, source, of, knowledge, they, also, say, that, important, forms, of, knowledge, come, directly, from, reason, without, sense, experience, like, knowledge, of, mathematical, and, logical, truths, according, to, some, rationalists, the, mind, possesses, inborn, ideas, which, it, can, access, without, the, help, of, the, senses, others, hold, that, there, is, an, additional, cognitive, faculty, sometimes, called, rational, intuition, through, which, people, acquire, nonempirical, knowledge, some, rationalists, limit, their, discussion, to, the, origin, of, concepts, saying, that, the, mind, relies, on, inborn, categories, to, understand, the, world, and, organize, experience, foundationalists, and, coherentists, disagree, about, the, structure, of, knowledge, foundationalism, distinguishes, between, basic, and, non, basic, beliefs, a, belief, is, basic, if, it, is, justified, directly, meaning, that, its, validity, does, not, depend, on, the, support, of, other, beliefs, a, belief, is, non, basic, if, it, is, justified, by, another, belief, for, example, the, belief, that, it, rained, last, night, is, a, non, basic, belief, if, it, is, inferred, from, the, observation, that, the, street, is, wet, according, to, foundationalism, basic, beliefs, are, the, foundation, on, which, all, other, knowledge, is, built, while, non, basic, beliefs, constitute, the, superstructure, resting, on, this, foundation, coherentists, reject, the, distinction, between, basic, and, non, basic, beliefs, saying, that, the, justification, of, any, belief, depends, on, other, beliefs, they, assert, that, a, belief, must, be, in, tune, with, other, beliefs, to, amount, to, knowledge, this, is, the, case, if, the, beliefs, are, consistent, and, support, each, other, according, to, coherentism, justification, is, a, holistic, aspect, determined, by, the, whole, system, of, beliefs, which, resembles, an, interconnected, web, the, view, of, foundherentism, is, an, intermediary, position, combining, elements, of, both, foundationalism, and, coherentism, it, accepts, the, distinction, between, basic, and, non, basic, beliefs, while, asserting, that, the, justification, of, non, basic, beliefs, depends, on, coherence, with, other, beliefs, infinitism, presents, another, approach, to, the, structure, of, knowledge, it, agrees, with, coherentism, that, there, are, no, basic, beliefs, while, rejecting, the, view, that, beliefs, can, support, each, other, in, a, circular, manner, instead, it, argues, that, beliefs, form, infinite, justification, chains, in, which, each, link, of, the, chain, supports, the, belief, following, it, and, is, supported, by, the, belief, preceding, it, the, disagreement, between, internalism, and, externalism, is, about, the, sources, of, justification, internalists, say, that, justification, depends, only, on, factors, within, the, individual, examples, of, such, factors, include, perceptual, experience, memories, and, the, possession, of, other, beliefs, this, view, emphasizes, the, importance, of, the, cognitive, perspective, of, the, individual, in, the, form, of, their, mental, states, it, is, commonly, associated, with, the, idea, that, the, relevant, factors, are, accessible, meaning, that, the, individual, can, become, aware, of, their, reasons, for, holding, a, justified, belief, through, introspection, and, reflection, externalism, rejects, this, view, saying, that, at, least, some, relevant, factors, are, external, to, the, individual, this, means, that, the, cognitive, perspective, of, the, individual, is, less, central, while, other, factors, specifically, the, relation, to, truth, become, more, important, for, instance, when, considering, the, belief, that, a, cup, of, coffee, stands, on, the, table, externalists, are, not, only, interested, in, the, perceptual, experience, that, led, to, this, belief, but, also, consider, the, quality, of, the, person, s, eyesight, their, ability, to, differentiate, coffee, from, other, beverages, and, the, circumstances, under, which, they, observed, the, cup, evidentialism, is, an, influential, internalist, view, it, says, that, justification, depends, on, the, possession, of, evidence, in, this, context, evidence, for, a, belief, is, any, information, in, the, individual, s, mind, that, supports, the, belief, for, example, the, perceptual, experience, of, rain, is, evidence, for, the, belief, that, it, is, raining, evidentialists, have, suggested, various, other, forms, of, evidence, including, memories, intuitions, and, other, beliefs, according, to, evidentialism, a, belief, is, justified, if, the, individual, s, evidence, supports, the, belief, and, they, hold, the, belief, on, the, basis, of, this, evidence, reliabilism, is, an, externalist, theory, asserting, that, a, reliable, connection, between, belief, and, truth, is, required, for, justification, some, reliabilists, explain, this, in, terms, of, reliable, processes, according, to, this, view, a, belief, is, justified, if, it, is, produced, by, a, reliable, belief, formation, process, like, perception, a, belief, formation, process, is, reliable, if, most, of, the, beliefs, it, causes, are, true, a, slightly, different, view, focuses, on, beliefs, rather, than, belief, formation, processes, saying, that, a, belief, is, justified, if, it, is, a, reliable, indicator, of, the, fact, it, presents, this, means, that, the, belief, tracks, the, fact, the, person, believes, it, because, it, is, a, fact, but, would, not, believe, it, otherwise, virtue, epistemology, is, another, type, of, externalism, and, is, sometimes, understood, as, a, form, of, reliabilism, it, says, that, a, belief, is, justified, if, it, manifests, intellectual, virtues, intellectual, virtues, are, capacities, or, traits, that, perform, cognitive, functions, and, help, people, form, true, beliefs, suggested, examples, include, faculties, like, vision, memory, and, introspection, in, the, epistemology, of, perception, direct, and, indirect, realists, disagree, about, the, connection, between, the, perceiver, and, the, perceived, object, direct, realists, say, that, this, connection, is, direct, meaning, that, there, is, no, difference, between, the, object, present, in, perceptual, experience, and, the, physical, object, causing, this, experience, according, to, indirect, realism, the, connection, is, indirect, since, there, are, mental, entities, like, ideas, or, sense, data, that, mediate, between, the, perceiver, and, the, external, world, the, contrast, between, direct, and, indirect, realism, is, important, for, explaining, the, nature, of, illusions, constructivism, in, epistemology, is, the, theory, that, how, people, view, the, world, is, not, a, simple, reflection, of, external, reality, but, an, invention, or, a, social, construction, this, view, emphasizes, the, creative, role, of, interpretation, while, undermining, objectivity, since, social, constructions, may, differ, from, society, to, society, according, to, contrastivism, knowledge, is, a, comparative, term, meaning, that, to, know, something, involves, distinguishing, it, from, relevant, alternatives, for, example, if, a, person, spots, a, bird, in, the, garden, they, may, know, that, it, is, a, sparrow, rather, than, an, eagle, but, they, may, not, know, that, it, is, a, sparrow, rather, than, an, indistinguishable, sparrow, hologram, epistemic, conservatism, is, a, view, about, belief, revision, it, gives, preference, to, the, beliefs, a, person, already, has, asserting, that, a, person, should, only, change, their, beliefs, if, they, have, a, good, reason, to, one, motivation, for, adopting, epistemic, conservatism, is, that, the, cognitive, resources, of, humans, are, limited, meaning, that, it, is, not, feasible, to, constantly, reexamine, every, belief, pragmatist, epistemology, is, a, form, of, fallibilism, that, emphasizes, the, close, relation, between, knowing, and, acting, it, sees, the, pursuit, of, knowledge, as, an, ongoing, process, guided, by, common, sense, and, experience, while, always, open, to, revision, bayesian, epistemology, is, a, formal, approach, based, on, the, idea, that, people, have, degrees, of, belief, representing, how, certain, they, are, it, uses, probability, theory, to, define, norms, of, rationality, that, govern, how, certain, people, should, be, about, their, beliefs, phenomenological, epistemology, emphasizes, the, importance, of, first, person, experience, it, distinguishes, between, the, natural, and, the, phenomenological, attitudes, the, natural, attitude, focuses, on, objects, belonging, to, common, sense, and, natural, science, the, phenomenological, attitude, focuses, on, the, experience, of, objects, and, aims, to, provide, a, presuppositionless, description, of, how, objects, appear, to, the, observer, particularism, and, generalism, disagree, about, the, right, method, of, conducting, epistemological, research, particularists, start, their, inquiry, by, looking, at, specific, cases, for, example, to, find, a, definition, of, knowledge, they, rely, on, their, intuitions, about, concrete, instances, of, knowledge, and, particular, thought, experiments, they, use, these, observations, as, methodological, constraints, that, any, theory, of, more, general, principles, needs, to, follow, generalists, proceed, in, the, opposite, direction, they, give, preference, to, general, epistemic, principles, saying, that, it, is, not, possible, to, accurately, identify, and, describe, specific, cases, without, a, grasp, of, these, principles, other, methods, in, contemporary, epistemology, aim, to, extract, philosophical, insights, from, ordinary, language, or, look, at, the, role, of, knowledge, in, making, assertions, and, guiding, actions, postmodern, epistemology, criticizes, the, conditions, of, knowledge, in, advanced, societies, this, concerns, in, particular, the, metanarrative, of, a, constant, progress, of, scientific, knowledge, leading, to, a, universal, and, foundational, understanding, of, reality, feminist, epistemology, critiques, the, effect, of, gender, on, knowledge, among, other, topics, it, explores, how, preconceptions, about, gender, influence, who, has, access, to, knowledge, how, knowledge, is, produced, and, which, types, of, knowledge, are, valued, in, society, decolonial, scholarship, criticizes, the, global, influence, of, western, knowledge, systems, often, with, the, aim, of, decolonizing, knowledge, to, undermine, western, hegemony, various, schools, of, epistemology, are, found, in, traditional, indian, philosophy, many, of, them, focus, on, the, different, sources, of, knowledge, called, pram, a, perception, inference, and, testimony, are, sources, discussed, by, most, schools, other, sources, only, considered, by, some, schools, are, non, perception, which, leads, to, knowledge, of, absences, and, presumption, buddhist, epistemology, tends, to, focus, on, immediate, experience, understood, as, the, presentation, of, unique, particulars, without, the, involvement, of, secondary, cognitive, processes, like, thought, and, desire, ny, ya, epistemology, discusses, the, causal, relation, between, the, knower, and, the, object, of, knowledge, which, happens, through, reliable, knowledge, formation, processes, it, sees, perception, as, the, primary, source, of, knowledge, drawing, a, close, connection, between, it, and, successful, action, m, m, s, epistemology, understands, the, holy, scriptures, known, as, the, vedas, as, a, key, source, of, knowledge, while, discussing, the, problem, of, their, right, interpretation, jain, epistemology, states, that, reality, is, many, sided, meaning, that, no, single, viewpoint, can, capture, the, entirety, of, truth, some, branches, of, epistemology, focus, on, the, problems, of, knowledge, within, specific, academic, disciplines, the, epistemology, of, science, examines, how, scientific, knowledge, is, generated, and, what, problems, arise, in, the, process, of, validating, justifying, and, interpreting, scientific, claims, a, key, issue, concerns, the, problem, of, how, individual, observations, can, support, universal, scientific, laws, further, topics, include, the, nature, of, scientific, evidence, and, the, aims, of, science, the, epistemology, of, mathematics, studies, the, origin, of, mathematical, knowledge, in, exploring, how, mathematical, theories, are, justified, it, investigates, the, role, of, proofs, and, whether, there, are, empirical, sources, of, mathematical, knowledge, epistemological, problems, are, found, in, most, areas, of, philosophy, the, epistemology, of, logic, examines, how, people, know, that, an, argument, is, valid, for, example, it, explores, how, logicians, justify, that, modus, ponens, is, a, correct, rule, of, inference, or, that, all, contradictions, are, false, epistemologists, of, metaphysics, investigate, whether, knowledge, of, ultimate, reality, is, possible, and, what, sources, this, knowledge, could, have, knowledge, of, moral, statements, like, the, claim, that, lying, is, wrong, belongs, to, the, epistemology, of, ethics, it, studies, the, role, of, ethical, intuitions, coherence, among, moral, beliefs, and, the, problem, of, moral, disagreement, the, ethics, of, belief, is, a, closely, related, field, covering, the, interrelation, between, epistemology, and, ethics, it, examines, the, norms, governing, belief, formation, and, asks, whether, violating, them, is, morally, wrong, religious, epistemology, studies, the, role, of, knowledge, and, justification, for, religious, doctrines, and, practices, it, evaluates, the, weight, and, reliability, of, evidence, from, religious, experience, and, holy, scriptures, while, also, asking, whether, the, norms, of, reason, should, be, applied, to, religious, faith, social, epistemology, focuses, on, the, social, dimension, of, knowledge, while, traditional, epistemology, is, mainly, interested, in, knowledge, possessed, by, individuals, social, epistemology, covers, knowledge, acquisition, transmission, and, evaluation, within, groups, with, specific, emphasis, on, how, people, rely, on, each, other, when, seeking, knowledge, historical, epistemology, examines, how, the, understanding, of, knowledge, and, related, concepts, has, changed, over, time, it, asks, whether, the, main, issues, in, epistemology, are, perennial, and, to, what, extent, past, epistemological, theories, are, relevant, to, contemporary, debates, it, is, particularly, concerned, with, scientific, knowledge, and, practices, associated, with, it, it, contrasts, with, the, history, of, epistemology, which, presents, reconstructs, and, evaluates, epistemological, theories, of, philosophers, in, the, past, naturalized, epistemology, is, closely, associated, with, the, natural, sciences, relying, on, their, methods, and, theories, to, examine, knowledge, naturalistic, epistemologists, focus, on, empirical, observation, to, formulate, their, theories, and, are, often, critical, of, approaches, to, epistemology, that, proceed, by, a, priori, reasoning, evolutionary, epistemology, is, a, naturalistic, approach, that, understands, cognition, as, a, product, of, evolution, examining, knowledge, and, the, cognitive, faculties, responsible, for, it, from, the, perspective, of, natural, selection, epistemologists, of, language, explore, the, nature, of, linguistic, knowledge, one, of, their, topics, is, the, role, of, tacit, knowledge, for, example, when, native, speakers, have, mastered, the, rules, of, grammar, but, are, unable, to, explicitly, articulate, those, rules, epistemologists, of, modality, examine, knowledge, about, what, is, possible, and, necessary, epistemic, problems, that, arise, when, two, people, have, diverging, opinions, on, a, topic, are, covered, by, the, epistemology, of, disagreement, epistemologists, of, ignorance, are, interested, in, epistemic, faults, and, gaps, in, knowledge, there, are, distinct, areas, of, epistemology, dedicated, to, specific, sources, of, knowledge, examples, are, the, epistemology, of, perception, the, epistemology, of, memory, and, the, epistemology, of, testimony, some, branches, of, epistemology, are, characterized, by, their, research, method, formal, epistemology, employs, formal, tools, found, in, logic, and, mathematics, to, investigate, the, nature, of, knowledge, experimental, epistemologists, rely, in, their, research, on, empirical, evidence, about, common, knowledge, practices, applied, epistemology, focuses, on, the, practical, application, of, epistemological, principles, to, diverse, real, world, problems, like, the, reliability, of, knowledge, claims, on, the, internet, how, to, assess, sexual, assault, allegations, and, how, racism, may, lead, to, epistemic, injustice, metaepistemologists, examine, the, nature, goals, and, research, methods, of, epistemology, as, a, metatheory, it, does, not, directly, defend, a, position, about, which, epistemological, theories, are, correct, but, examines, their, fundamental, concepts, and, background, assumptions, epistemology, and, psychology, were, not, defined, as, distinct, fields, until, the, 19th, century, earlier, investigations, about, knowledge, often, do, not, fit, neatly, into, today, s, academic, categories, both, contemporary, disciplines, study, beliefs, and, the, mental, processes, responsible, for, their, formation, and, change, one, important, contrast, is, that, psychology, describes, what, beliefs, people, have, and, how, they, acquire, them, thereby, explaining, why, someone, has, a, specific, belief, the, focus, of, epistemology, is, on, evaluating, beliefs, leading, to, a, judgment, about, whether, a, belief, is, justified, and, rational, in, a, particular, case, epistemology, has, a, similar, intimate, connection, to, cognitive, science, which, understands, mental, events, as, processes, that, transform, information, artificial, intelligence, relies, on, the, insights, of, epistemology, and, cognitive, science, to, implement, concrete, solutions, to, problems, associated, with, knowledge, representation, and, automatic, reasoning, logic, is, the, study, of, correct, reasoning, for, epistemology, it, is, relevant, to, inferential, knowledge, which, arises, when, a, person, reasons, from, one, known, fact, to, another, this, is, the, case, for, example, if, a, person, does, not, know, directly, that, 572, 382, 954, displaystyle, 572, 382, 954, but, comes, to, infer, it, based, on, their, knowledge, that, 2, 2, 4, displaystyle, 2, 2, 4, 8, 7, 15, displaystyle, 8, 7, 15, and, 5, 3, 8, displaystyle, 5, 3, 8, whether, an, inferential, belief, amounts, to, knowledge, depends, on, the, form, of, reasoning, used, in, particular, that, the, process, does, not, violate, the, laws, of, logic, another, overlap, between, the, two, fields, is, found, in, the, epistemic, approach, to, fallacy, theory, fallacies, are, faulty, arguments, based, on, incorrect, reasoning, the, epistemic, approach, to, fallacies, explains, why, they, are, faulty, stating, that, arguments, aim, to, expand, knowledge, according, to, this, view, an, argument, is, a, fallacy, if, it, fails, to, do, so, a, further, intersection, is, found, in, epistemic, logic, which, uses, formal, logical, devices, to, study, epistemological, concepts, like, knowledge, and, belief, both, decision, theory, and, epistemology, are, interested, in, the, foundations, of, rational, thought, and, the, role, of, beliefs, unlike, many, approaches, in, epistemology, the, main, focus, of, decision, theory, lies, less, in, the, theoretical, and, more, in, the, practical, side, exploring, how, beliefs, are, translated, into, action, decision, theorists, examine, the, reasoning, involved, in, decision, making, and, the, standards, of, good, decisions, they, identify, beliefs, as, a, central, aspect, of, decision, making, one, of, their, innovations, is, to, distinguish, between, weaker, and, stronger, beliefs, this, helps, them, take, the, effect, of, uncertainty, on, decisions, into, consideration, epistemology, and, education, have, a, shared, interest, in, knowledge, with, one, difference, being, that, education, focuses, on, the, transmission, of, knowledge, exploring, the, roles, of, both, learner, and, teacher, learning, theory, examines, how, people, acquire, knowledge, behavioral, learning, theories, explain, the, process, in, terms, of, behavior, changes, for, example, by, associating, a, certain, response, with, a, particular, stimulus, cognitive, learning, theories, study, how, the, cognitive, processes, that, affect, knowledge, acquisition, transform, information, pedagogy, looks, at, the, transmission, of, knowledge, from, the, teacher, s, side, exploring, the, teaching, methods, they, may, employ, in, teacher, centered, methods, the, teacher, takes, the, role, of, the, main, authority, delivering, knowledge, and, guiding, the, learning, process, in, student, centered, methods, the, teacher, mainly, supports, and, facilitates, the, learning, process, while, the, students, take, a, more, active, role, the, beliefs, students, have, about, knowledge, called, personal, epistemology, affect, their, intellectual, development, and, learning, success, the, anthropology, of, knowledge, examines, how, knowledge, is, acquired, stored, retrieved, and, communicated, it, studies, the, social, and, cultural, circumstances, that, affect, how, knowledge, is, reproduced, and, changes, covering, the, role, of, institutions, like, university, departments, and, scientific, journals, as, well, as, face, to, face, discussions, and, online, communications, it, understands, knowledge, in, a, wide, sense, that, encompasses, various, forms, of, understanding, and, culture, including, practical, skills, unlike, epistemology, it, is, not, interested, in, whether, a, belief, is, true, or, justified, but, in, how, understanding, is, reproduced, in, society, the, sociology, of, knowledge, is, a, closely, related, field, with, a, similar, conception, of, knowledge, it, explores, how, physical, demographic, economic, and, sociocultural, factors, impact, knowledge, it, examines, in, what, sociohistorical, contexts, knowledge, emerges, and, the, effects, it, has, on, people, for, example, how, socioeconomic, conditions, are, related, to, the, dominant, ideology, in, a, society, early, reflections, on, the, nature, and, sources, of, knowledge, are, found, in, ancient, history, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, plato, 427, 347, bce, studied, what, knowledge, is, examining, how, it, differs, from, true, opinion, by, being, based, on, good, reasons, according, to, him, the, process, of, learning, something, is, a, form, of, recollection, in, which, the, soul, remembers, what, it, already, knew, before, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, was, particularly, interested, in, scientific, knowledge, exploring, the, role, of, sensory, experience, and, how, to, make, inferences, from, general, principles, the, hellenistic, schools, began, to, arise, in, the, 4th, century, bce, the, epicureans, had, an, empiricist, outlook, stating, that, sensations, are, always, accurate, and, act, as, the, supreme, standard, of, judgments, the, stoics, defended, a, similar, position, but, limited, themselves, to, lucid, and, specific, sensations, which, they, regarded, as, true, the, skepticists, questioned, that, knowledge, is, possible, recommending, instead, suspension, of, judgment, to, arrive, at, a, state, of, tranquility, the, upanishads, philosophical, scriptures, composed, in, ancient, india, between, 700, and, 300, bce, examined, how, people, acquire, knowledge, including, the, role, of, introspection, comparison, and, deduction, in, the, 6th, century, bce, the, school, of, aj, ana, developed, a, radical, skepticism, questioning, the, possibility, and, usefulness, of, knowledge, the, school, of, nyaya, emerged, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, and, provided, a, systematic, treatment, of, how, people, acquire, knowledge, distinguishing, between, valid, and, invalid, sources, when, buddhist, philosophers, later, became, interested, in, epistemology, they, relied, on, concepts, developed, in, nyaya, and, other, traditions, buddhist, philosopher, dharmakirti, 6th, or, 7th, century, ce, analyzed, the, process, of, knowing, as, a, series, of, causally, related, events, ancient, chinese, philosophers, understood, knowledge, as, an, interconnected, phenomenon, fundamentally, linked, to, ethical, behavior, and, social, involvement, many, saw, wisdom, as, the, goal, of, attaining, knowledge, mozi, 470, 391, bce, proposed, a, pragmatic, approach, to, knowledge, using, historical, records, sensory, evidence, and, practical, outcomes, to, validate, beliefs, mencius, c, 372, 289, bce, explored, analogical, reasoning, as, another, source, of, knowledge, xunzi, c, 310, 220, bce, aimed, to, combine, empirical, observation, and, rational, inquiry, he, emphasized, the, importance, of, clarity, and, standards, of, reasoning, without, excluding, the, role, of, feeling, and, emotion, the, relation, between, reason, and, faith, was, a, central, topic, in, the, medieval, period, in, arabic, persian, philosophy, al, farabi, c, 870, 950, and, averroes, 1126, 1198, discussed, how, philosophy, and, theology, interact, and, which, is, the, better, vehicle, to, truth, al, ghazali, c, 1056, 1111, criticized, many, of, the, core, teachings, of, previous, islamic, philosophers, saying, that, they, rely, on, unproven, assumptions, that, do, not, amount, to, knowledge, in, western, philosophy, anselm, of, canterbury, 1033, 1109, proposed, that, theological, teaching, and, philosophical, inquiry, are, in, harmony, and, complement, each, other, peter, abelard, 1079, 1142, argued, against, unquestioned, theological, authorities, and, said, that, all, things, are, open, to, rational, doubt, influenced, by, aristotle, thomas, aquinas, 1225, 1274, developed, an, empiricist, theory, stating, that, nothing, is, in, the, intellect, unless, it, first, appeared, in, the, senses, according, to, an, early, form, of, direct, realism, proposed, by, william, of, ockham, c, 1285, 1349, perception, of, mind, independent, objects, happens, directly, without, intermediaries, meanwhile, in, 14th, century, india, ga, ge, a, developed, a, reliabilist, theory, of, knowledge, and, considered, the, problems, of, testimony, and, fallacies, in, china, wang, yangming, 1472, 1529, explored, the, unity, of, knowledge, and, action, holding, that, moral, knowledge, is, inborn, and, can, be, attained, by, overcoming, self, interest, the, course, of, modern, philosophy, was, shaped, by, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, who, claimed, that, philosophy, must, begin, from, a, position, of, indubitable, knowledge, of, first, principles, inspired, by, skepticism, he, aimed, to, find, absolutely, certain, knowledge, by, encountering, truths, that, cannot, be, doubted, he, thought, that, this, is, the, case, for, the, assertion, i, think, therefore, i, am, from, which, he, constructed, the, rest, of, his, philosophical, system, descartes, together, with, baruch, spinoza, 1632, 1677, and, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, 1646, 1716, belonged, to, the, school, of, rationalism, which, asserts, that, the, mind, possesses, innate, ideas, independent, of, experience, john, locke, 1632, 1704, rejected, this, view, in, favor, of, an, empiricism, according, to, which, the, mind, is, a, blank, slate, this, means, that, all, ideas, depend, on, sense, experience, either, as, ideas, of, sense, which, are, directly, presented, through, the, senses, or, as, ideas, of, reflection, which, the, mind, creates, by, reflecting, on, ideas, of, sense, david, hume, 1711, 1776, used, this, idea, to, explore, the, limits, of, what, people, can, know, he, said, that, knowledge, of, facts, is, never, certain, adding, that, knowledge, of, relations, between, ideas, like, mathematical, truths, can, be, certain, but, contains, no, information, about, the, world, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, tried, to, find, a, middle, position, between, rationalism, and, empiricism, by, identifying, a, type, of, knowledge, that, hume, had, missed, for, kant, this, is, knowledge, about, principles, that, underlie, all, experience, and, structure, it, such, as, spatial, and, temporal, relations, and, fundamental, categories, of, understanding, in, the, 19th, century, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, argued, against, empiricism, saying, that, sensory, impressions, on, their, own, cannot, amount, to, knowledge, since, all, knowledge, is, actively, structured, by, the, knowing, subject, john, stuart, mill, 1806, 1873, defended, a, wide, sweeping, form, of, empiricism, and, explained, knowledge, of, general, truths, through, inductive, reasoning, charles, peirce, 1839, 1914, thought, that, all, knowledge, is, fallible, emphasizing, that, knowledge, seekers, should, always, be, ready, to, revise, their, beliefs, if, new, evidence, is, encountered, he, used, this, idea, to, argue, against, cartesian, foundationalism, seeking, absolutely, certain, truths, in, the, 20th, century, fallibilism, was, further, explored, by, j, l, austin, 1911, 1960, and, karl, popper, 1902, 1994, in, continental, philosophy, edmund, husserl, 1859, 1938, applied, the, skeptic, idea, of, suspending, judgment, to, the, study, of, experience, by, not, judging, whether, an, experience, is, accurate, or, not, he, tried, to, describe, the, internal, structure, of, experience, instead, logical, positivists, like, a, j, ayer, 1910, 1989, said, that, all, knowledge, is, either, empirical, or, analytic, bertrand, russell, 1872, 1970, developed, an, empiricist, sense, datum, theory, distinguishing, between, direct, knowledge, by, acquaintance, of, sense, data, and, indirect, knowledge, by, description, which, is, inferred, from, knowledge, by, acquaintance, common, sense, had, a, central, place, in, g, e, moore, s, 1873, 1958, epistemology, he, used, trivial, observations, like, the, fact, that, he, has, two, hands, to, argue, against, abstract, philosophical, theories, that, deviate, from, common, sense, ordinary, language, philosophy, as, practiced, by, the, late, ludwig, wittgenstein, 1889, 1951, is, a, similar, approach, that, tries, to, extract, epistemological, insights, from, how, ordinary, language, is, used, edmund, gettier, 1927, 2021, conceived, counterexamples, against, the, idea, that, knowledge, is, the, same, as, justified, true, belief, these, counterexamples, prompted, many, philosophers, to, suggest, alternative, definitions, of, knowledge, one, of, the, alternatives, considered, was, reliabilism, which, says, that, knowledge, requires, reliable, sources, shifting, the, focus, away, from, justification, virtue, epistemology, a, closely, related, response, analyses, belief, formation, in, terms, of, the, intellectual, virtues, or, cognitive, competencies, involved, in, the, process, naturalized, epistemology, as, conceived, by, willard, van, orman, quine, 1908, 2000, employs, concepts, and, ideas, from, the, natural, sciences, to, formulate, its, theories,
