hypolite, l, on, denizard, rivail, under, the, pseudonym, allan, kardec, reporting, s, ances, in, which, he, observed, a, series, of, phenomena, that, he, attributed, to, incorporeal, intelligence, spirits, his, assumption, of, spirit, communication, was, validated, by, many, contemporaries, among, them, many, scientists, and, philosophers, who, attended, s, ances, and, studied, the, phenomena, his, work, was, later, extended, by, writers, like, leon, denis, arthur, conan, doyle, camille, flammarion, ernesto, bozzano, chico, xavier, divaldo, pereira, franco, waldo, vieira, johannes, greber, and, others, spiritism, has, adherents, in, many, countries, throughout, the, world, including, spain, united, states, canada, japan, germany, france, england, argentina, portugal, and, especially, brazil, which, has, the, largest, proportion, and, greatest, number, of, followers, the, physician, john, ferriar, wrote, an, essay, towards, a, theory, of, apparitions, in, 1813, in, which, he, argued, that, sightings, of, ghosts, were, the, result, of, optical, illusions, later, the, french, physician, alexandre, jacques, fran, ois, bri, re, de, boismont, published, on, hallucinations, or, the, rational, history, of, apparitions, dreams, ecstasy, magnetism, and, somnambulism, in, 1845, in, which, he, claimed, sightings, of, ghosts, were, the, result, of, hallucinations, david, turner, a, retired, physical, chemist, suggested, that, ball, lightning, could, cause, inanimate, objects, to, move, erratically, joe, nickell, of, the, committee, for, skeptical, inquiry, wrote, that, there, was, no, credible, scientific, evidence, that, any, location, was, inhabited, by, spirits, of, the, dead, limitations, of, human, perception, and, ordinary, physical, explanations, can, account, for, ghost, sightings, for, example, air, pressure, changes, in, a, home, causing, doors, to, slam, humidity, changes, causing, boards, to, creak, condensation, in, electrical, connections, causing, intermittent, behavior, or, lights, from, a, passing, car, reflected, through, a, window, at, night, pareidolia, an, innate, tendency, to, recognize, patterns, in, random, perceptions, is, what, some, skeptics, believe, causes, people, to, believe, that, they, have, seen, ghosts, reports, of, ghosts, seen, out, of, the, corner, of, the, eye, may, be, accounted, for, by, the, sensitivity, of, human, peripheral, vision, according, to, nickell, peripheral, vision, can, easily, mislead, especially, late, at, night, when, the, brain, is, tired, and, more, likely, to, misinterpret, sights, and, sounds, nickell, further, states, science, cannot, substantiate, the, existence, of, a, life, energy, that, could, survive, death, without, dissipating, or, function, at, all, without, a, brain, why, would, clothes, survive, he, asks, if, ghosts, glide, then, why, do, people, claim, to, hear, them, with, heavy, footfalls, nickell, says, that, ghosts, act, the, same, way, as, dreams, memories, and, imaginings, because, they, too, are, mental, creations, they, are, evidence, not, of, another, world, but, of, this, real, and, natural, one, benjamin, radford, from, the, committee, for, skeptical, inquiry, and, author, of, the, 2017, book, investigating, ghosts, the, scientific, search, for, spirits, writes, that, ghost, hunting, is, the, world, s, most, popular, paranormal, pursuit, yet, to, date, ghost, hunters, cannot, agree, on, what, a, ghost, is, or, offer, proof, that, they, exist, it, s, all, speculation, and, guesswork, he, writes, that, it, would, be, useful, and, important, to, distinguish, between, types, of, spirits, and, apparitions, until, then, it, s, merely, a, parlor, game, distracting, amateur, ghost, hunters, from, the, task, at, hand, according, to, research, in, anomalistic, psychology, visions, of, ghosts, may, arise, from, hypnagogic, hallucinations, waking, dreams, experienced, in, the, transitional, states, to, and, from, sleep, in, a, study, of, two, experiments, into, alleged, hauntings, wiseman, et, al, 2003, came, to, the, conclusion, that, people, consistently, report, unusual, experiences, in, haunted, areas, because, of, environmental, factors, which, may, differ, across, locations, some, of, these, factors, included, the, variance, of, local, magnetic, fields, size, of, location, and, lighting, level, stimuli, of, which, witnesses, may, not, be, consciously, aware, some, researchers, such, as, michael, persinger, of, laurentian, university, canada, have, speculated, that, changes, in, geomagnetic, fields, created, e, g, by, tectonic, stresses, in, the, earth, s, crust, or, solar, activity, could, stimulate, the, brain, s, temporal, lobes, and, produce, many, of, the, experiences, associated, with, hauntings, sound, is, thought, to, be, another, cause, of, supposed, sightings, richard, lord, and, richard, wiseman, have, concluded, that, infrasound, can, cause, humans, to, experience, bizarre, feelings, in, a, room, such, as, anxiety, extreme, sorrow, a, feeling, of, being, watched, or, even, the, chills, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, which, can, cause, changes, in, perception, of, the, visual, and, auditory, systems, was, speculated, upon, as, a, possible, explanation, for, haunted, houses, as, early, as, 1921, people, who, experience, sleep, paralysis, often, report, seeing, ghosts, during, their, experiences, neuroscientists, baland, jalal, and, v, s, ramachandran, have, recently, proposed, neurological, theories, for, why, people, hallucinate, ghosts, during, sleep, paralysis, their, theories, emphasize, the, role, of, the, parietal, lobe, and, mirror, neurons, in, triggering, such, ghostly, hallucinations, the, hebrew, bible, contains, several, references, to, owb, hebrew, which, are, in, a, few, places, akin, to, shades, of, classical, mythology, but, mostly, describing, mediums, in, connection, with, necromancy, and, spirit, consulting, which, are, grouped, with, witchcraft, and, other, forms, of, divination, under, the, category, of, forbidden, occult, activities, the, most, notable, reference, to, a, shade, is, in, the, first, book, of, samuel, in, which, a, disguised, king, saul, has, the, witch, of, endor, conduct, a, seance, to, summon, the, dead, prophet, samuel, a, similar, term, appearing, throughout, the, scriptures, is, repha, im, archived, 2019, 03, 06, at, the, wayback, machine, hebrew, which, while, describing, the, race, of, giants, formerly, inhabiting, canaan, in, many, verses, also, refer, to, the, spirits, of, dead, ancestors, of, sheol, like, shades, in, many, others, such, as, in, the, book, of, isaiah, jewish, mythology, and, folkloric, traditions, describe, dybbuks, malicious, possessing, spirits, believed, to, be, the, dislocated, soul, of, a, dead, person, however, the, term, does, not, appear, in, the, kabbalah, or, talmudic, literature, where, it, is, rather, called, an, unclean, spirit, or, ru, a, tumah, hebrew, it, supposedly, leaves, the, host, body, once, it, has, accomplished, its, goal, sometimes, after, being, helped, in, the, new, testament, jesus, has, to, persuade, the, disciples, that, he, is, not, a, ghost, following, the, resurrection, luke, 24, 37, 39, some, versions, of, the, bible, such, as, the, kjv, and, nkjv, use, the, term, spirit, similarly, jesus, followers, at, first, believe, he, is, a, ghost, spirit, when, they, see, him, walking, on, water, some, christian, denominations, such, as, the, roman, catholic, church, consider, ghosts, as, beings, who, while, tied, to, earth, no, longer, live, on, the, material, plane, and, linger, in, an, intermediate, state, before, continuing, their, journey, to, heaven, on, occasion, god, would, allow, the, souls, in, this, state, to, return, to, earth, to, warn, the, living, of, the, need, for, repentance, christians, are, taught, that, it, is, sinful, to, attempt, to, conjure, or, control, spirits, in, accordance, with, deuteronomy, xviii, 9, 12, some, ghosts, are, actually, said, to, be, demons, in, disguise, who, the, church, teaches, in, accordance, with, i, timothy, 4, 1, that, they, come, to, deceive, people, and, draw, them, away, from, god, and, into, bondage, as, a, result, attempts, to, contact, the, dead, may, lead, to, unwanted, contact, with, a, demon, or, an, unclean, spirit, as, was, said, to, occur, in, the, case, of, robbie, mannheim, a, fourteen, year, old, maryland, youth, the, seventh, day, adventist, view, is, that, a, soul, is, not, equivalent, to, spirit, or, ghost, depending, on, the, bible, version, and, that, save, for, the, holy, spirit, all, spirits, or, ghosts, are, demons, in, disguise, furthermore, they, teach, that, in, accordance, with, genesis, 2, 7, ecclesiastes, 12, 7, there, are, only, two, components, to, a, soul, neither, of, which, survives, death, with, each, returning, to, its, respective, source, christadelphians, and, jehovah, s, witnesses, reject,

ghosts, the, souls, of, the, deceased, dwell, in, barzakh, only, a, barrier, in, quran, in, islamic, tradition, this, refers, to, an, entire, intermediary, world, between, the, living, and, the, afterlife, the, world, especially, cemeteries, are, perforated, with, several, gateways, to, the, otherworld, or, barzakh, in, rare, occasions, the, dead, can, appear, to, the, living, pure, souls, such, as, the, souls, of, saints, are, commonly, addressed, as, r, while, impure, souls, seeking, for, revenge, are, often, addressed, as, afarit, an, inappropriate, burial, can, also, cause, a, soul, to, stay, in, this, world, whereupon, roaming, the, earth, as, a, ghost, since, the, just, souls, remain, close, to, their, tomb, some, people, try, to, communicate, with, them, in, order, to, gain, hidden, knowledge, contact, with, the, dead, is, not, the, same, as, contact, with, jinn, who, alike, could, provide, knowledge, concealed, from, living, humans, many, encounters, with, ghosts, are, related, to, dreams, supposed, to, occur, in, the, realm, of, symbols, belief, in, spirits, have, not, ceased, to, exist, in, muslim, belief, smile, of, new, born, babies, is, sometimes, used, as, a, proof, for, sighting, spirits, like, ghosts, however, the, connection, to, the, other, world, fades, during, life, on, earth, but, is, resumed, after, death, once, again, smiling, of, dying, people, is, considered, as, evidence, for, recognizing, the, spirit, of, their, beloved, ones, yet, muslims, who, affirm, the, existence, of, ghosts, are, carefully, when, interacting, with, spirits, as, the, ghosts, of, humans, can, be, as, bad, as, the, jinn, worst, of, all, however, are, the, devils, muslim, authors, like, ghazali, ibn, qayyim, and, suyuti, wrote, in, more, details, about, the, life, of, ghosts, ibn, qayyim, and, suyuti, assert, when, a, soul, desires, to, turn, back, to, earth, long, enough, it, is, gradually, released, from, restrictions, of, barzakh, and, able, to, move, freely, each, spirit, experiences, afterlife, in, accordance, with, their, deeds, and, condictions, in, the, earthly, life, evil, souls, will, find, the, afterlife, as, painful, and, punishment, imprisoned, until, god, allows, them, to, interact, with, other, others, good, souls, are, not, restricted, they, are, free, to, come, visit, other, souls, and, even, come, down, to, lower, regions, the, higher, planes, illiyy, n, are, considered, to, be, broader, than, the, lower, ones, the, lowest, being, the, most, narrow, sijj, n, the, spiritual, space, is, not, thought, as, spatial, but, reflects, the, capacity, of, the, spirit, the, more, pure, the, spirit, gets, the, more, it, is, able, to, interact, with, other, souls, and, thus, reaches, a, broader, degree, of, freedom, the, ismailite, philosopher, nasir, khusraw, conjectured, that, evil, human, souls, turn, into, demons, when, their, bodies, die, because, of, their, intense, attachment, to, the, bodily, world, they, were, worse, than, the, jinn, and, fairies, who, in, turn, could, become, devils, if, they, pursue, evil, a, similar, thought, is, recorded, by, muhammad, ibn, zakariya, al, razi, the, ghosts, of, saints, are, thought, to, transmit, blessings, from, god, through, the, heavenly, realm, to, whose, who, visit, their, graves, therefore, visiting, the, graves, of, saints, and, prophets, became, a, major, ritual, in, muslim, spirituality, a, bhoota, is, the, ghost, of, a, deceased, being, in, indian, religions, interpretations, of, how, bhootas, come, into, existence, vary, by, region, and,
