commonly, portrayed, as, both, the, protagonist, and, antagonist, spider, tales, are, found, extensively, throughout, west, africa, but, the, anansi, tales, from, ghana, are, seen, to, be, the, origin, of, these, stories, and, are, among, the, best, known, as, anansi, s, name, comes, from, the, word, in, the, akan, language, for, spider, they, later, spread, to, the, west, indies, suriname, sierra, leone, where, they, were, introduced, by, jamaican, maroons, and, the, netherlands, antilles, also, cura, ao, aruba, and, bonaire, anansi, is, depicted, in, many, different, ways, and, with, different, names, from, ananse, kwaku, ananse, and, anancy, to, his, new, world, iterations, such, as, ba, anansi, 102, 123, kompa, nanzi, and, or, nanzi, nancy, aunt, nancy, and, sis, nancy, even, though, he, is, always, depicted, as, a, male, in, his, stories, while, often, depicted, as, an, animal, anansi, has, many, representations, which, include, an, anthropomorphic, spider, with, a, human, face, or, conversely, a, human, with, spider, like, features, such, as, eight, legs, anansi, also, has, a, family, in, several, folktales, involving, him, consisting, of, his, long, suffering, wife, okonore, yaa, known, in, other, regions, as, aso, crooky, or, shi, maria, ntikuma, his, firstborn, son, tikelenkelen, his, big, headed, son, nankonhwea, his, son, with, a, spindly, neck, and, spindly, legs, finally, afudohwedohwe, his, pot, bellied, son, anansi, also, has, a, beautiful, daughter, named, anansewa, in, other, tales, like, those, introduced, in, the, work, of, efua, sutherland, in, efua, s, tale, he, embarks, on, a, mission, to, ensure, that, anansewa, can, have, an, appropriate, suitor, it, is, said, that, odomankoma, is, also, known, as, ananse, kokuroko, meaning, great, spider, who, might, be, ananse, but, this, could, actually, be, chalked, up, to, the, two, being, relatives, it, is, said, in, some, akan, myths, that, ananse, becomes, the, creator, so, it, could, be, either, roles, changing, similar, to, bobowissi, becoming, the, god, of, lightning, after, tano, akora, s, role, is, changed, from, the, god, of, lightning, to, the, god, of, war, after, fighting, with, owuo, or, odomankoma, s, sunsum, being, reincarnated, inside, of, ananse, after, owuo, kills, him, supported, by, how, sunsum, works, via, the, father, anansi, stories, were, part, of, an, exclusively, oral, tradition, and, anansi, himself, was, seen, as, synonymous, with, skill, and, wisdom, in, speech, stories, of, anansi, became, such, a, prominent, and, familiar, part, of, ashanti, oral, culture, that, they, eventually, encompassed, many, kinds, of, fables, evidenced, by, the, work, of, r, s, rattray, who, recorded, many, of, these, tales, in, both, the, english, and, twi, languages, as, well, as, the, work, of, scholar, peggy, appiah, so, well, known, is, he, that, he, has, given, his, name, to, the, whole, rich, tradition, of, tales, on, which, so, many, ghanaian, children, are, brought, up, anansesem, or, spider, tales, in, similar, fashion, oral, tradition, is, what, introduced, anansi, tales, to, the, rest, of, the, world, especially, the, caribbean, via, the, people, that, were, enslaved, during, the, atlantic, slave, trade, as, a, result, the, importance, of, anansi, socially, did, not, diminish, when, slaves, were, brought, to, the, new, world, instead, anansi, was, often, celebrated, as, a, symbol, of, slave, resistance, and, survival, because, anansi, is, able, to, turn, the, tables, on, his, powerful, oppressors, by, using, his, cunning, and, trickery, a, model, of, behaviour, used, by, slaves, to, gain, the, upper, hand, within, the, confines, of, the, plantation, power, structure, anansi, is, also, believed, to, have, played, a, multifunctional, role, in, the, slaves, lives, as, well, as, inspiring, strategies, of, resistance, the, tales, enabled, enslaved, africans, to, establish, a, sense, of, continuity, with, their, african, past, and, offered, them, the, means, to, transform, and, assert, their, identity, within, the, boundaries, of, captivity, as, historian, lawrence, w, levine, argues, in, black, culture, and, consciousness, enslaved, africans, in, the, new, world, devoted, the, structure, and, message, of, their, tales, to, the, compulsions, and, needs, of, their, present, situation, 1977, 90, the, jamaican, versions, of, these, stories, are, some, of, the, best, preserved, because, jamaica, had, the, largest, concentration, of, enslaved, ashanti, in, the, americas, akin, to, their, ashanti, origins, each, of, these, stories, carries, its, own, proverb, at, the, end, at, the, end, of, the, story, anansi, and, brah, dead, there, is, a, proverb, that, suggests, that, even, in, times, of, slavery, anansi, was, referred, to, by, his, akan, original, name, kwaku, anansi, or, simply, as, kwaku, interchangeably, with, anansi, the, proverb, is, if, yuh, cyaan, ketch, kwaku, yuh, ketch, him, shut, which, refers, to, when, brah, dead, brother, death, or, drybones, a, personification, of, death, was, chasing, anansi, to, kill, him, its, meaning, the, target, of, revenge, and, destruction, even, killing, will, be, anyone, very, close, to, the, intended, such, as, loved, ones, and, family, members, however, like, anansi, s, penchant, for, ingenuity, anansi, s, quintessential, presence, in, the, diaspora, saw, the, trickster, figure, reinvented, through, a, multi, ethnic, exchange, that, transcended, its, akan, ashanti, origins, typified, in, the, diversity, of, names, attributed, to, these, anansi, stories, from, the, anansi, tori, to, the, kuenta, di, nanzi, even, the, character, ti, bouki, the, buffoon, constantly, harassed, by, ti, malice, or, uncle, mischief, a, haitian, trickster, associated, with, anansi, references, this, exchange, bouki, itself, is, a, word, descending, from, the, wolof, language, that, also, references, a, particular, folk, animal, the, hyena, indigenous, to, them, the, same, applies, to, anansi, s, role, in, the, lives, of, africans, beyond, the, era, of, slavery, new, world, anansi, tales, entertain, just, as, much, as, they, instruct, highlight, his, avarice, and, other, flaws, alongside, his, cleverness, and, feature, the, mundane, just, as, much, as, they, do, the, subversive, anansi, becomes, both, an, ideal, to, be, aspired, toward, and, a, cautionary, tale, against, the, selfish, desires, that, can, cause, our, undoing, 163, 164, anansi, has, effectively, evolved, beyond, a, mere, trickster, figure, the, wealth, of, narratives, and, social, influences, have, thus, led, to, him, being, considered, a, classical, hero, among, many, stories, attached, to, anansi, and, collected, in, literature, one, explains, how, he, became, known, as, the, owner, of, all, stories, in, the, world, it, is, so, popular, that, it, has, been, studied, and, republished, alongside, other, stories, many, times, including, as, children, s, books, like, the, caldecott, medal, winning, a, story, a, story, by, gail, e, haley, which, follows, akan, oral, tradition, by, beginning, the, tale, with, we, do, not, really, mean, we, do, not, really, mean, that, what, we, are, about, to, say, is, true, a, story, a, story, let, it, come, let, it, go, haley, s, story, later, continues, it, by, concluding, this, is, my, story, that, i, have, related, if, it, be, sweet, or, if, it, be, not, sweet, take, some, elsewhere, and, let, some, come, back, to, me, the, following, folktales, listed, will, begin, with, this, notable, folktale, alongside, other, anansesem, spider, tales, some, of, which, were, recorded, by, rattray, in, his, prolific, work, on, the, subject, additional, stories, that, arose, out, of, the, anansesem, tradition, in, the, diaspora, have, been, included, this, version, of, the, most, commonly, retold, folktale, was, recorded, by, rattray, in, his, extensive, book, on, akan, ashanti, folktales, 54, 58, and, as, the, tale, generally, goes, there, were, no, stories, in, the, world, as, they, were, all, held, by, the, sky, god, nyame, anansi, wanted, nyame, s, stories, and, asked, him, to, give, them, to, him, nyame, did, not, want, to, give, up, his, stories, even, though, the, spider, insisted, he, could, afford, to, pay, for, them, unconvinced, nyame, then, told, anansi, that, many, great, kingdoms, like, kokofu, bekwai, and, asumengya, tried, to, buy, the, stories, from, him, yet, could, not, afford, them, he, then, pondered, how, anansi, completely, insignificant, in, comparison, would, succeed, where, they, had, failed, anansi, however, was, not, intimidated, and, promised, he, could, afford, them, asking, nyame, their, price, as, a, result, nyame, entertained, anansi, s, offer, but, nonetheless, set, a, high, price, hoping, that, it, would, be, impossible, for, anansi, to, accomplish, the, difficult, labours, that, he, devised, for, him, anansi, had, to, capture, four, of, the, most, dangerous, creatures, in, the, world, namely, the, python, onini, hornets, mmoboro, leopard, osebo, and, fairy, mmoatia, undaunted, clever, anansi, promised, to, bring, nyame, those, four, things, and, even, added, his, own, mother, ya, nsia, for, extra, measure, nyame, accepted, his, offer, and, advised, him, to, begin, his, journey, so, anansi, set, about, putting, his, schemes, into, motion, first, anansi, went, to, his, family, and, told, them, about, his, plan, including, ya, nsia, then, he, asked, his, wife, aso, for, advice, as, he, wished, to, capture, onini, the, python, first, aso, advised, him, to, cut, a, branch, from, a, palm, tree, and, gather, some, string, creeper, vines, anansi, returned, with, them, and, aso, told, him, to, take, them, to, the, river, where, onini, lived, nearby, pretending, to, argue, with, her, to, draw, the, python, s, attention, anansi, agreed, with, her, plan, and, took, them, he, then, pretended, to, debate, with, her, in, an, imaginary, argument, over, the, length, of, onini, s, body, while, he, headed, there, pretending, aso, had, claimed, onini, s, body, was, longer, than, the, branch, of, a, full, grown, palm, tree, onini, eventually, heard, anansi, pretending, to, argue, with, aso, so, he, approached, the, spider, and, asked, anansi, what, he, was, talking, about, anansi, explained, and, onini, unaware, of, anansi, s, trickery, quickly, agreed, to, help, anansi, prove, that, he, was, longer, than, a, palm, tree, branch, thus, anansi, told, the, python, to, stretch, himself, beside, the, branch, anansi, had, gathered, and, onini, then, did, so, eagerly, unaware, he, had, fallen, into, a, trap, anansi, then, took, the, string, creeper, vines, he, had, gathered, and, tied, up, onini, completely, anansi, then, lost, no, time, in, carrying, onini, off, to, nyame, mocking, the, python, along, the, way, and, informing, him, of, his, bargain, with, nyame, triumphant, anansi, soon, arrived, and, presented, onini, to, nyame, the, sky, god, acknowledged, anansi, s, accomplishment, but, reminded, him, that, he, still, had, other, challenges, imagining, in, secret, that, anansi, would, fail, next, anansi, returned, home, to, aso, and, informed, her, of, what, he, had, accomplished, deciding, to, capture, the, mmoboro, hornets, next, he, asked, her, for, advice, and, his, wife, obliged, telling, him, to, find, a, gourd, and, fill, it, with, water, he, was, then, to, carry, the, gourd, along, with, him, to, see, the, hornets, anansi, followed, her, advice, heading, toward, the, bush, where, the, hornets, roamed, in, search, of, them, soon, the, spider, noticed, a, swarm, of, hornets, loitering, near, one, and, he, crept, close, to, them, readying, his, gourd, anansi, then, sprinkled, some, of, his, water, at, the, mmoboro, hornets, careful, to, save, some, for, himself, the, spider, then, doused, himself, with, the, remaining, water, he, had, collected, and, cut, a, leaf, from, a, banana, tree, nearby, covering, his, head, with, it, soon, the, hornets, flew, to, him, in, a, fit, but, anansi, showed, them, his, banana, leaf, still, wet, and, explained, that, it, had, been, raining, clever, anansi, then, warned, the, hornets, that, the, rain, was, dangerous, suggesting, that, they, could, enter, his, gourd, so, that, they, would, not, be, overcome, the, hornets, agreed, and, thanked, anansi, for, helping, them, unaware, of, his, scheme, and, they, all, flew, inside, filling, the, gourd, as, they, sought, the, shelter, anansi, had, promised, them, once, all, of, them, had, entered, anansi, stoppered, the, mouth, of, the, gourd, and, taunted, them, for, succumbing, to, his, scheme, the, spider, told, them, of, his, plan, to, trade, them, to, the, sky, god, for, his, stories, and, took, the, hornets, to, nyame, nyame, accepted, the, hornets, but, reminded, anansi, that, he, still, had, other, tasks, left, in, spite, of, his, successes, so, far, certain, the, spider, still, could, not, complete, his, task, he, bade, the, spider, to, continue, his, search, and, anansi, left, for, home, anansi, soon, returned, to, aso, afterward, and, informed, her, of, his, success, then, plotted, against, osebo, the, leopard, with, her, aso, told, anansi, to, dig, a, hole, to, catch, osebo, and, cover, it, anansi, caught, on, to, her, plan, immediately, and, told, her, it, was, enough, then, he, went, to, the, place, where, osebo, normally, could, be, found, anansi, dug, a, deep, pit, in, the, ground, covered, it, with, brushwood, and, decided, to, return, home, knowing, that, osebo, would, eventually, stumble, into, the, pit, as, night, drew, near, sure, enough, anansi, returned, to, the, pit, the, next, morning, and, found, osebo, trapped, inside, of, it, anansi, feigned, sympathy, and, asked, the, leopard, why, he, was, trapped, inside, he, asked, osebo, if, he, had, been, drinking, again, something, anansi, had, constantly, warned, the, leopard, about, and, the, spider, continued, his, act, lamenting, that, he, wanted, to, help, osebo, but, was, certain, that, osebo, would, attempt, to, eat, him, afterward, osebo, insisted, that, he, would, not, harm, anansi, so, the, spider, agreed, to, help, him, anansi, went, aside, and, cut, two, long, sticks, with, his, knife, for, the, leopard, to, climb, out, of, the, hole, with, and, told, osebo, to, stretch, his, arms, wide, secretly, leaving, the, leopard, vulnerable, osebo, unaware, of, yet, another, scheme, by, anansi, then, attempted, to, scale, the, sticks, so, that, he, could, escape, but, anansi, withdrew, his, knife, again, and, tossed, it, at, osebo, the, hilt, of, the, knife, struck, osebo, s, head, and, the, leopard, fell, down, into, the, pit, now, unconscious, satisfied, that, his, scheme, had, worked, anansi, gathered, some, additional, sticks, and, formed, a, ladder, descending, to, the, bottom, of, the, pit, to, collect, osebo, anansi, then, gloated, just, as, he, had, before, and, told, the, leopard, about, his, bargain, with, nyame, carrying, him, away, to, the, sky, god, anansi, then, presented, osebo, to, nyame, when, he, arrived, and, nyame, accepted, anansi, s, gift, the, sky, god, however, was, still, not, convinced, that, anansi, would, succeed, in, completing, his, challenge, and, reminded, the, spider, that, he, had, yet, to, accomplish, all, of, the, tasks, he, was, assigned, the, spider, returned, home, another, time, deciding, to, capture, mmoatia, the, fairy, after, some, thought, anansi, then, decided, upon, a, plan, and, carved, an, akua, doll, next, the, spider, gathered, the, sap, out, of, a, gum, tree, covering, it, until, the, akua, doll, thus, became, very, sticky, but, anansi, was, not, done, he, pounded, some, eto, mashed, yams, collected, by, his, wife, aso, and, covered, the, akua, doll, s, hand, with, it, the, spider, then, gathered, a, basin, and, placed, some, eto, inside, of, it, once, he, had, filled, the, basin, anansi, then, took, some, of, his, silk, and, tied, a, string, around, the, akua, doll, s, waist, so, that, he, could, manipulate, it, heading, off, to, the, land, of, fairies, once, he, had, finished, anansi, placed, the, doll, in, front, of, an, odum, tree, a, place, where, fairies, often, congregated, and, sat, the, basin, with, the, eto, in, front, of, it, as, bait, anansi, then, hid, behind, the, odum, tree, and, waited, for, one, of, the, mmoatia, to, appear, soon, one, came, lured, away, from, her, sisters, by, the, eto, that, the, spider, had, placed, in, front, of, the, akua, doll, enticed, by, the, eto, mmoatia, asked, the, doll, if, she, could, have, some, of, it, anansi, then, tugged, the, akua, doll, s, waist, and, it, nodded, its, head, in, response, which, made, mmoatia, excited, mmoatia, returned, to, her, sisters, and, asked, if, they, would, allow, her, to, eat, some, noting, that, she, completely, unaware, of, anansi, s, trickery, had, been, offered, some, eto, by, the, akua, doll, mmoatia, s, sisters, allowed, her, to, so, the, fairy, returned, to, the, basin, and, devoured, the, eto, when, she, had, finished, mmoatia, thanked, the, akua, doll, but, anansi, did, not, tug, his, string, the, akua, doll, did, not, nod, to, acknowledge, mmoatia, s, gratitude, slightly, upset, mmoatia, told, her, sisters, what, had, happened, and, they, advised, her, to, slap, the, doll, s, face, as, recompense, mmoatia, agreed, and, then, slapped, the, akua, doll, but, her, hand, became, stuck, angered, the, fairy, informed, them, of, what, had, happened, and, another, sister, suggested, that, mmoatia, should, slap, the, doll, again, this, time, with, her, other, hand, the, fairy, obliged, and, tried, again, only, for, her, remaining, hand, to, become, stuck, on, the, gum, that, covered, the, akua, doll, mmoatia, asked, her, sisters, for, help, a, final, time, informing, them, that, both, her, hands, were, now, stuck, another, sister, told, mmoatia, to, bludgeon, the, doll, with, the, rest, of, her, body, certain, that, mmoatia, would, be, successful, this, time, in, punishing, the, akua, doll, however, the, fairy, followed, the, advice, of, her, sisters, and, only, became, stuck, to, the, gum, that, covered, the, doll, anansi, had, laid, in, front, of, the, odum, tree, entirely, anansi, then, emerged, from, hiding, and, used, the, rest, of, the, string, he, had, tied, around, his, doll, to, bind, mmoatia, with, his, string, entirely, he, then, mocked, mmoatia, also, just, as, he, had, done, to, the, others, he, had, captured, before, her, and, told, the, fairy, of, his, scheme, to, offer, her, to, nyame, as, well, however, anansi, still, had, another, task, he, wished, to, complete, before, he, returned, to, the, sky, god, finally, anansi, headed, to, his, home, to, visit, his, mother, ya, nsia, and, reminded, her, of, his, agreement, with, the, sky, god, to, exchange, her, as, part, of, the, price, for, nyame, s, stories, anansi, s, mother, complied, with, him, and, the, spider, then, carried, her, alongside, mmoatia, to, nyame, presenting, both, of, them, to, nyame, to, complete, the, bargain, for, the, sky, god, s, stories, nyame, accepted, both, of, them, thoroughly, impressed, at, the, success, of, the, spider, and, assembled, a, meeting, within, his, kingdom, the, sky, god, summoned, his, elders, the, kontire, and, akwam, chiefs, the, adontem, general, of, his, army, s, main, body, the, gyase, the, oyoko, ankobea, and, finally, kyidom, who, led, his, rear, guard, nyame, then, told, them, about, the, task, anansi, had, accomplished, when, none, else, not, even, the, greatest, kingdoms, could, afford, his, stories, nyame, recounted, each, of, the, creatures, anansi, had, presented, the, sky, god, with, as, well, as, his, own, mother, ya, nsia, and, allowed, his, audience, to, see, each, of, these, gifts, for, themselves, nyame, finally, acknowledged, anansi, s, talents, and, told, the, spider, he, now, had, the, sky, god, s, blessings, the, people, rejoiced, alongside, nyame, as, he, then, announced, that, his, stories, would, no, longer, be, known, by, his, name, or, belong, to, him, from, then, on, the, sky, god, s, stories, would, belong, to, anansi, and, all, of, them, would, be, known, as, spider, stories, for, eternity, so, it, is, that, every, story, no, matter, the, subject, or, theme, is, called, a, spider, story, it, s, worth, noting, that, there, are, substantial, variants, of, this, tale, with, other, retellings, like, haley, s, omitting, aso, and, ya, nsia, others, such, as, a, caribbean, version, see, tiger, as, the, one, whom, the, stories, come, from, another, common, version, of, this, folktale, portrays, mmoatia, as, a, relatively, solitary, fairy, capable, of, turning, invisible, while, another, does, not, require, anansi, to, capture, python, another, popular, story, tells, of, how, anansi, once, tried, to, hoard, all, of, the, world, s, wisdom, in, a, pot, in, some, versions, a, calabash, in, this, story, anansi, was, already, very, clever, but, he, wanted, more, knowledge, so, he, decided, to, gather, all, the, wisdom, that, he, could, find, and, keep, it, in, a, safe, place, soon, anansi, collected, all, of, the, wisdom, found, throughout, the, world, and, sealed, inside, of, a, pot, however, he, was, still, concerned, that, it, was, not, safe, enough, so, he, secretly, took, the, pot, to, a, tall, thorny, tree, in, the, forest, in, some, versions, the, silk, cotton, tree, his, younger, son, ntikuma, saw, him, go, and, followed, him, at, some, distance, to, see, what, he, was, doing, ntikuma, noticed, the, pot, was, much, bigger, than, anansi, could, handle, he, couldn, t, hold, it, while, trying, to, climb, the, tree, as, a, result, anansi, tied, the, pot, in, front, of, him, and, then, resumed, his, attempt, yet, the, pot, still, obscured, anansi, and, caused, him, to, slip, down, the, tree, as, he, climbed, each, failure, caused, anansi, to, become, increasingly, frustrated, ntikuma, laughed, when, he, saw, what, anansi, was, doing, why, don, t, you, tie, the, pot, behind, you, then, you, will, be, able, to, grip, the, tree, he, suggested, anansi, was, so, annoyed, by, his, failed, attempts, and, the, realization, that, his, child, was, right, that, the, pot, slipped, from, his, possession, the, pot, soon, crashed, into, the, ground, and, all, of, the, wisdom, that, the, spider, had, stored, inside, of, it, spilled, out, of, it, to, make, matters, even, worse, a, storm, arrived, and, caused, a, mighty, rain, throughout, the, forest, the, deluge, of, rainwater, covered, the, ground, and, washed, the, wisdom, that, had, spilled, away, from, them, until, it, washed, into, the, river, stream, nearby, the, currents, of, the, stream, carried, the, wisdom, anansi, had, collected, out, to, sea, and, soon, it, spread, throughout, the, entire, world, ruining, anansi, s, plan, and, making, his, goal, impossible, this, angered, the, spider, anansi, then, chased, his, son, ntikuma, home, throughout, the, rain, but, he, soon, came, to, an, epiphany, and, accepted, his, loss, once, he, finally, caught, up, with, his, son, what, is, the, use, of, all, that, wisdom, if, a, young, child, still, needs, to, put, you, right, thus, anansi, failed, to, steal, the, world, s, wisdom, that, day, and, instead, a, little, of, it, lives, in, everyone, one, day, a, famine, came, and, kwaku, anansi, told, his, family, that, he, d, search, for, food, so, they, could, eat, 66, 70, he, soon, went, to, a, stream, and, met, some, people, who, he, discovered, were, spirits, the, spirits, were, draining, the, water, in, the, hope, that, they, would, be, able, to, catch, some, fish, to, eat, anansi, was, intrigued, and, asked, if, he, could, join, them, and, the, spirits, in, turn, gave, him, their, permission, the, spirits, were, using, their, skulls, to, drain, the, river, and, when, anansi, approached, the, spirits, asked, if, they, could, remove, his, as, well, anansi, said, they, could, and, they, did, so, giving, him, his, skull, so, that, he, could, join, them, while, they, drained, the, water, the, spirits, sang, a, beautiful, song, we, the, spirits, when, we, splash, the, river, bed, dry, to, catch, fish, we, use, our, heads, to, splash, the, water, oh, the, spirits, we, are, splashing, the, water, the, song, intrigued, anansi, and, he, asked, if, he, could, sing, it, also, they, allowed, him, and, together, they, continued, to, sing, until, they, finally, drained, some, of, the, stream, the, spirits, gave, anansi, his, own, share, of, fish, in, a, basket, and, restored, his, skull, but, warned, him, never, to, sing, the, song, again, on, that, day, or, his, skull, would, open, and, fall, off, again, anansi, said, that, he, had, no, reason, to, sing, it, again, because, they, d, given, him, more, than, enough, to, eat, and, he, wanted, nothing, else, the, spirits, bade, him, farewell, and, anansi, went, away, the, spirits, soon, left, and, went, elsewhere, to, catch, more, fish, soon, the, spirits, began, singing, their, song, again, and, anansi, eventually, heard, it, he, began, to, sing, it, again, and, as, soon, as, he, finished, his, skull, fell, off, again, like, they, d, warned, him, anansi, picked, his, skull, up, in, embarrassment, and, cried, out, to, the, spirits, that, his, head, had, fallen, off, the, spirits, heard, him, and, decided, to, return, to, him, to, hear, him, explain, himself, anansi, begged, them, for, help, and, apologized, to, them, asking, them, to, restore, his, skull, the, spirits, said, they, would, but, warned, anansi, that, if, he, disobeyed, them, again, they, would, not, return, to, help, him, and, bade, him, leave, before, heading, off, on, their, own, yet, just, as, soon, as, they, d, left, anansi, heard, them, singing, their, song, and, repeated, it, himself, anansi, s, skull, detached, and, fell, again, having, disobeyed, the, spirits, another, time, before, it, hit, the, ground, he, caught, it, with, his, rear, end, and, he, fled, from, the, riverside, so, it, is, that, anansi, has, a, small, head, and, a, large, bottom, because, of, his, hard, headedness, nyame, sired, three, children, one, day, esum, or,

his, favorite, child, and, wished, to, make, him, a, chief, he, harvested, a, yam, known, as, kintinkyi, in, secret, and, decided, that, the, son, who, could, guess, it, would, become, chief, and, receive, his, royal, stool, as, proof, soon, nyame, blackened, his, royal, stool, and, asked, his, subjects, if, any, could, guess, what, his, thoughts, were, anansi, happened, to, be, there, and, said, that, he, knew, nyame, told, anansi, to, gather, his, sons, from, the, villages, and, anansi, left, however, anansi, didn, t, truly, know, but, secretly, decided, he, would, learn, anansi,

him, within, his, disguise, and, mused, to, himself, that, if, anansi, were, present, he, d, know, the, name, of, the, bird, because, he, d, said, he, knew, that, nyame, wished, his, son, owia, to, receive, his, stool, and, that, he, would, give, whoever, could, guess, his, yam, s, name, the, seat, he, continued, to, ponder, in, secret, while, anansi, overheard, nyame, s, plan, and, finally, flew, away, removing, his, disguise, he, went, to, esum, s, village, first, and, told, him, that, his, father, wished, to, see, him, but, kept, nyame, s, plans, secret, night, gave, him, roasted, corn, to, eat, as, thanks, and, anansi, soon, went, to, osrane, s, village, osrane, was, told, the, same, and, he, gave, anansi, yam, as, thanks, in, return, before, the, spider, left, for, owia, s, village, keeping, the, truth, from, osrane, as, well, soon, anansi, arrived, and, told, owia, the, same, owia, mentioned, that, he, wished, his, father, could, see, what, he, did, so, that, he, could, know, owia, s, true, intent, but, decided, he, would, treat, anansi, the, same, for, his, father, had, chosen, him, as, his, messenger, and, he, wanted, to, treat, him, as, he, would, his, father, nyame, owia, then, prepared, the, best, sheep, for, anansi, to, eat, as, thanks, and, in, return, anansi, decided, to, tell, owia, of, his, father, s, intentions, in, secret, revealing, the, name, of, the, yam, he, d, harvested, anansi, then, made, a, pair, of, drums, that, would, shout, the, yam, s, name, so, that, owia, would, remember, the, name, of, nyame, s, yam, which, was, kintinkyi, and, the, two, returned, to, the, other, sons, of, nyame, anansi, brought, them, each, before, nyame, and, nyame, called, an, assembly, together, so, they, could, welcome, anansi, and, nyame, s, sons, anansi, said, he, d, completed, nyame, s, task, and, the, sky, god, revealed, his, intentions, to, his, three, sons, he, then, told, esum, who, was, oldest, that, he, would, be, allowed, to, guess, first, yet, esum, did, not, know, and, said, its, name, was, pona, the, villagers, booed, him, osrane, the, second, oldest, was, given, a, chance, but, he, also, failed, to, guess, the, yam, s, name, assuming, it, was, called, asante, the, villagers, booed, him, also, owia, the, youngest, was, then, given, a, chance, to, guess, anansi, played, the, drums, as, he, had, promised, and, owia, remembered, the, true, name, of, nyame, s, yam, kintinkyi, the, assembly, cheered, instead, nyame, then, spoke, to, esum, his, eldest, son, and, punished, him, for, he, had, not, paid, attention, to, him, while, nyame, had, raised, him, evil, things, thus, would, be, done, during, esum, s, time, next, nyame, scolded, osrane, who, had, also, not, listened, to, him, while, he, raised, him, only, children, would, frolic, during, his, time, finally, nyame, spoke, to, his, youngest, son, owia, and, praised, him, nyame, made, him, chief, and, told, him, that, any, issue, that, needed, to, be, settled, would, take, place, during, his, time, he, gave, him, the, rainbow, to, protect, himself, from, his, brothers, if, they, ever, wished, to, harm, him, and, promised, that, it, would, remind, his, subjects, who, saw, it, that, danger, would, not, befall, them, lastly, he, gave, anansi, his, blessing, for, knowing, his, inner, thoughts, and, said, anansi, would, be, known, as, his, messenger, in, this, tale, 76, 80, anansi, went, to, the, sky, god, nyame, one, day, he, wanted, to, take, one, of, nyame, s, sheep, named, kra, kwame, and, eat, it, anansi, told, nyame, that, if, he, was, allowed, he, would, bring, nyame, a, maiden, as, a, gift, from, one, of, the, villages, in, return, nyame, agreed, and, gave, him, the, sheep, so, anansi, left, and, set, out, for, his, home, later, preparing, the, sheep, once, he, was, finished, preparing, it, anansi, searched, for, a, village, and, discovered, one, where, only, women, lived, the, spider, settled, there, and, gave, each, of, them, some, of, the, sheep, he, had, killed, marrying, every, woman, in, the, village, and, forsaking, his, promise, to, nyame, soon, however, a, hunter, visited, the, village, that, anansi, had, settled, in, and, witnessed, what, he, was, doing, the, hunter, soon, left, and, went, to, nyame, reporting, what, he, d, seen, in, the, village, nyame, became, furious, upon, learning, of, anansi, s, deception, and, ordered, his, messengers, to, go, the, village, anansi, was, living, in, and, take, every, woman, there, his, messengers, obeyed, and, took, every, woman, save, one, that, was, ill, at, that, time, and, presented, them, to, nyame, disappointed, anansi, wasn, t, sure, what, he, d, do, as, he, now, only, had, one, remaining, wife, as, she, was, too, sick, to, help, him, he, asked, her, and, she, simply, told, anansi, to, gather, a, gourd, and, bathe, her, filling, up, the, gourd, with, the, water, he, d, used, afterward, that, water, would, then, house, all, of, the, diseases, that, had, afflicted, her, anansi, obeyed, his, wife, and, she, became, incredibly, beautiful, anansi, realized, she, was, more, beautiful, than, any, of, the, other, wives, he, d, taken, on, while, living, in, the, tribe, in, fact, and, smitten, by, her, anansi, remarried, the, woman, yet, the, hunter, visited, the, village, again, he, saw, anansi, s, wife, now, beautiful, beyond, comparison, and, returned, to, nyame, to, report, what, he, d, discovered, the, hunter, told, nyame, that, anansi, had, tricked, him, because, the, women, that, nyame, had, taken, from, anansi, were, all, hideous, in, comparison, to, the, beautiful, woman, anansi, had, as, his, current, wife, nyame, was, furious, again, then, ordered, his, messengers, to, send, for, her, and, they, went, to, anansi, s, village, looking, for, the, woman, anansi, met, them, and, they, told, him, of, nyame, s, wish, he, complied, showed, them, where, his, wife, was, and, they, took, her, with, them, to, nyame, anansi, however, had, a, plan, of, his, own, and, began, his, scheme, once, they, left, anansi, searched, for, the, gourd, that, had, the, water, he, d, bathed, his, wife, with, and, then, took, a, skin, and, made, a, drum, with, it, he, then, made, another, drum, and, called, for, his, son, ntikuma, together, the, two, began, beating, the, drums, and, dancing, while, singing, vulgarities, anene, the, crow, another, messenger, of, nyame, saw, what, anansi, was, doing, and, told, nyame, about, the, dance, nyame, then, sent, his, messengers, and, asked, them, to, bring, anansi, to, him, as, he, wanted, the, spider, to, perform, the, dance, for, him, anansi, however, told, them, that, he, could, only, perform, his, dance, around, his, wives, and, that, he, needed, his, drum, he, promised, that, he, would, dance, before, nyame, if, he, agreed, to, this, so, the, messengers, informed, nyame, and, he, agreed, to, anansi, s, terms, the, messengers, then, brought, anansi, to, the, harem, where, his, wives, were, kept, and, he, began, playing, soon, nyame, came, and, danced, to, the, song, while, the, former, wives, of, anansi, joined, in, anansi, s, final, wife, however, recognized, the, gourd, anansi, s, drum, was, made, from, and, decided, not, to, dance, suspecting, anansi, s, trickery, yet, she, was, coerced, into, joining, nyame, in, the, performance, before, she, could, begin, however, anansi, opened, the, drum, and, tossed, all, the, water, from, the, gourd, all, of, the, diseases, that, were, once, washed, away, returned, and, sickness, fell, upon, the, tribe, so, it, was, that, the, sky, god, caused, anansi, to, bring, all, illnesses, to, the, world, a, long, time, ago, aso, was, not, yet, married, to, anansi, 132, 136, instead, she, was, married, to, another, man, known, as, akwasi, the, jealous, one, befitting, his, name, he, was, very, possessive, of, aso, and, wanted, no, one, else, to, see, or, interact, with, her, so, he, built, a, small, village, where, only, the, two, of, them, lived, akwasi, the, jealous, one, was, especially, worried, of, losing, aso, because, he, was, sterile, and, knew, that, others, would, take, her, away, from, him, if, they, lived, among, other, people, one, day, nyame, grew, tired, of, akwasi, the, jealous, one, s, failure, and, told, young, men, in, the, other, villages, about, his, marriage, with, aso, nyame, told, the, men, that, the, first, man, to, take, aso, from, akwasi, the, jealous, one, and, sire, a, child, could, marry, her, however, all, of, the, men, who, accepted, his, challenge, failed, to, capture, aso, anansi, watched, all, that, transpired, and, soon, went, to, nyame, himself, he, promised, nyame, that, he, could, accomplish, what, other, men, had, not, the, sky, god, asked, if, anansi, was, certain, and, the, spider, answered, that, he, would, be, able, to, as, long, as, he, was, given, the, items, he, requested, to, help, him, namely, medicine, to, make, guns, as, well, as, bullets, nyame, accepted, his, request, and, gave, anansi, what, he, needed, soon, anansi, went, throughout, many, villages, and, told, them, that, nyame, had, told, him, to, bring, the, powder, and, bullets, to, them, so, that, they, could, go, hunting, for, him, anansi, told, them, that, he, would, return, and, then, take, the, meat, they, collected, so, that, he, could, give, it, to, nyame, they, agreed, to, his, request, and, he, then, distributed, powder, and, bullets, amongst, them, until, all, villages, had, some, anansi, then, left, for, a, time, and, wove, a, palm, leaf, basket, returning, when, he, had, finished, to, the, villages, he, d, distributed, hunting, supplies, to, in, turn, he, received, all, they, d, hunted, and, soon, headed, for, akwasi, the, jealous, one, s, settlement, eventually, anansi, came, upon, a, river, where, akwasi, and, aso, drank, then, took, some, of, the, meat, and, placed, it, into, the, water, he, then, carried, the, basket, with, him, which, still, had, more, than, enough, meat, and, reached, akwasi, the, jealous, one, s, village, aso, noticed, anansi, arrive, and, called, out, to, her, husband, surprised, that, anansi, had, come, kwasi, the, jealous, one, came, out, and, inquired, who, anansi, was, and, the, spider, replied, that, he, d, come, by, the, order, of, nyame, to, rest, on, his, journey, akwasi, the, jealous, one, came, out, praised, anansi, and, then, welcomed, anansi, to, his, village, aso, on, the, other, hand, noticed, the, meat, anansi, had, left, in, the, river, and, told, him, what, she, d, discovered, anansi, simply, replied, that, she, was, welcome, to, have, it, as, he, didn, t, need, it, and, then, informed, aso, that, she, could, feed, any, pets, they, possessed, with, it, thus, aso, collected, it, offering, the, meat, to, her, husband, anansi, then, asked, aso, cook, him, some, food, and, she, obliged, preparing, to, make, fufu, soon, aso, began, preparing, fufu, for, anansi, but, he, told, her, it, was, not, enough, when, he, learned, what, she, was, making, anansi, then, asked, her, to, use, a, larger, pot, and, when, aso, did, so, anansi, offered, more, of, the, meat, he, d, collected, with, one, caveat, out, of, the, meat, he, possessed, aso, could, only, cook, the, thighs, which, numbered, 40, aso, obliged, and, she, then, placed, the, food, alongside, the, rest, she, d, prepared, when, she, finished, cooking, it, aso, then, collected, her, own, portion, and, the, rest, began, eating, as, well, anansi, however, was, not, satisfied, and, complained, saying, that, the, fufu, aso, had, prepared, lacked, salt, akwasi, the, jealous, one, then, asked, aso, to, bring, some, to, anansi, but, the, spider, objected, he, told, akwasi, that, it, was, rude, to, command, her, to, gather, the, salt, when, she, was, eating, and, suggested, that, he, get, the, salt, instead, akwasi, the, jealous, one, accepted, anansi, s, advice, and, left, to, find, more, salt, while, anansi, secretly, snuck, medicine, from, his, pouch, and, put, it, into, akwasi, s, fufu, akwasi, the, jealous, one, soon, returned, but, anansi, informed, aso, s, husband, that, he, was, full, and, no, longer, needed, any, akwasi, sat, the, salt, aside, and, began, eating, his, fufu, again, completely, oblivious, to, what, anansi, had, done, eventually, akwasi, the, jealous, one, realized, he, did, not, know, anansi, s, name, and, asked, the, spider, what, he, was, called, anansi, replied, that, his, name, was, rise, up, and, make, love, to, aso, which, startled, akwasi, so, he, asked, his, wife, aso, if, she, d, heard, his, name, as, well, aso, acknowledged, that, she, did, and, akwasi, left, to, prepare, a, room, for, anansi, as, a, result, when, he, finished, he, told, anansi, to, sleep, there, but, anansi, replied, that, he, couldn, t, because, he, was, nyame, s, soul, washer, and, only, slept, in, a, room, with, an, open, veranda, his, parents, had, also, conceived, him, there, so, he, was, forbidden, from, sleeping, in, closed, rooms, akwasi, the, jealous, one, thus, asked, anansi, where, he, wished, to, sleep, instead, but, anansi, then, made, another, excuse, the, open, room, had, to, be, in, a, house, that, belonged, to, nyame, to, do, otherwise, would, make, akwasi, equal, to, nyame, and, break, the, commandment, anansi, d, been, given, thus, anansi, asked, akwasi, the, jealous, one, to, give, him, a, sleeping, mat, so, he, could, sleep, in, front, of, their, room, while, they, slept, soon, anansi, laid, upon, the, sleeping, mat, and, waited, for, akwasi, and, his, wife, aso, to, sleep, and, then, sang, a, song, to, the, gods, while, he, played, his, sepirewa, certain, the, plan, he, d, concocted, would, be, successful, akuamoa, ananse, today, we, shall, achieve, something, today, ananse, the, child, of, nsia, the, mother, of, nyame, the, sky, god, today, we, shall, achieve, something, to, day, ananse, the, soul, washer, to, the, nyame, the, sky, god, today, i, shall, see, something, once, anansi, finished, he, put, his, sepirewa, aside, and, fell, asleep, suddenly, anansi, awoke, to, hear, akwasi, the, jealous, one, calling, out, to, him, akwasi, however, refused, to, call, the, spider, by, the, name, he, d, been, given, so, anansi, remained, silent, the, medicine, anansi, d, poisoned, akwasi, the, jealous, one, with, had, worked, akwasi, tried, another, time, but, refused, to, call, anansi, by, the, name, he, d, given, him, again, so, anansi, did, not, answer, him, eventually, akwasi, succumbed, and, finally, pleaded, rise, up, and, make, love, to, aso, falling, for, anansi, s, scheme, anansi, responded, to, akwasi, the, jealous, one, and, opened, his, door, asking, akwasi, what, troubled, him, akwasi, said, that, he, needed, to, leave, for, a, moment, and, then, left, once, akwasi, the, jealous, one, was, gone, the, spider, went, into, the, man, s, room, and, saw, aso, was, awake, anansi, asked, her, if, she, d, heard, what, akwasi, had, said, and, she, instead, asked, him, to, tell, her, thus, anansi, repeated, the, name, he, d, given, to, them, implying, that, he, was, to, make, love, to, her, aso, accepted, anansi, s, answer, and, the, two, made, love, going, back, to, sleep, once, they, finished, akwasi, the, jealous, one, returned, completely, unaware, of, what, had, happened, and, soon, went, to, sleep, as, well, however, his, stomach, would, trouble, him, again, and, he, d, call, anansi, out, for, help, using, the, same, name, anansi, had, given, him, akwasi, the, jealous, one, would, leave, while, anansi, snuck, into, their, bedroom, to, make, love, with, aso, for, a, total, of, nine, times, before, morning, came, anansi, left, akwasi, s, village, when, the, next, day, arrived, and, did, not, return, two, moons, eventually, passed, and, aso, s, pregnancy, became, visible, akwasi, the, jealous, one, asked, his, wife, how, she, d, gotten, pregnant, because, he, was, sterile, and, could, not, sire, children, with, her, aso, told, akwasi, that, he, in, fact, had, told, her, to, make, love, to, anansi, explaining, that, the, child, she, d, conceived, was, his, akwasi, thus, decided, to, take, her, to, nyame, s, village, and, the, two, left, however, aso, gave, birth, on, the, way, so, she, rested, a, moment, the, two, took, the, child, to, the, village, of, nyame, afterward, and, told, him, what, had, taken, place, nyame, did, not, believe, the, two, s, story, and, said, that, no, one, had, left, his, village, urging, them, to, point, out, the, culprit, among, the, villagers, aso, agreed, to, do, so, and, soon, saw, anansi, sitting, on, a, ridgepole, in, the, distance, she, pointed, to, anansi, and, told, nyame, that, he, was, the, one, who, d, impregnated, her, he, moved, further, down, on, the, ridgepole, in, an, attempt, to, hide, again, but, aso, found, him, there, however, this, caused, anansi, to, fall, over, dirtying, himself, and, in, return, anansi, complained, that, their, actions, had, defiled, him, for, he, was, nyame, s, soul, washer, and, nyame, s, wishes, had, been, ignored, as, a, result, akwasi, the, jealous, one, was, seized, by, nyame, s, subjects, for, disobeying, the, god, s, command, and, ordered, to, sacrifice, a, sheep, as, penance, utterly, embarrassed, akwasi, finished, his, sacrifice, and, then, told, the, sky, god, that, anansi, could, have, aso, giving, her, to, the, spider, to, become, his, wife, yet, there, was, another, cost, for, what, had, transpired, the, child, anansi, had, sired, through, aso, was, taken, and, killed, what, remained, of, its, body, was, scattered, throughout, nyame, s, village, as, a, reminder, so, it, was, that, aso, became, anansi, s, wife, and, jealousy, came, into, the, tribe, sometime, after, they, were, married, it, is, said, kwaku, anansi, the, spider, and, his, wife, aso, were, living, together, 118, 122, one, day, they, had, returned, from, a, visit, to, the,

law, had, died, the, previous, day, in, response, anansi, told, his, wife, aso, what, had, taken, place, and, told, aso, that, they, would, go, to, the, village, to, mourn, her, mother, as, the, funeral, would, take, place, within, a, few, days, soon, the, messenger, left, and, the, next, morning, came, anansi, spared, no, time, and, went, to, the, others, in, the, village, for, a, favor, and, found, odwan, the, sheep, okra, the, cat, okraman, the, dog, akoko, the, fowl, and, aberekyie, the, goat, anansi, told, them, of, his, mother, in, law, s, passing, and, asked, if, they, could,

funeral, of, aso, s, mother, would, take, place, he, called, those, who, d, agreed, to, accompany, him, and, they, left, the, village, but, not, without, supplies, guns, drums, palm, wine, and, other, things, first, so, they, would, have, things, to, share, with, the, rest, of, those, who, attended, as, they, celebrated, his, mother, in, law, s, memory, soon, anansi, reached, his, mother, in, law, s, village, and, fired, their, guns, in, the, air, to, signal, they, had, arrived, and, went, to, the, home, where, her, wake, was, taking, place, anansi, shared, all, that, he, d, brought, giving, palm, wine, to, those, mourning, he, then, presented, an, offering, to, help, pay, for, the, funeral, six, peredwan, packets, of, gold, dust, a, velvet, pillow, two, cloths, a, wool, blanket, shell, money, to, barter, with, ghosts, a, sheep, and, more, palm, wine, they, accepted, his, offer, and, the, others, matched, it, the, next, morning, everyone, ate, and, invited, anansi, to, eat, as, well, however, anansi, said, that, he, was, not, allowed, to, as, it, was, his, mother, in, law, s, funeral, and, he, would, not, eat, until, the, eighth, day, instead, anansi, said, he, d, gather, some, for, his, neighbors, who, d, accompanied, him, and, remain, while, they, left, true, to, his, word, anansi, asked, aso, to, find, them, food, and, she, brought, it, to, them, anansi, bade, them, farewell, and, he, remained, at, the, home, days, passed, and, he, resisted, eating, but, when, the, fourth, day, came, he, was, too, hungry, to, resist, eating, and, went, to, search, for, food, inside, the, home, where, he, was, staying, he, went, into, the, kitchen, and, saw, that, there, was, a, fire, going, and, at, that, fire, there, were, beans, boiling, in, a, pot, anansi, decided, he, would, eat, those, so, he, took, his, leopard, hat, and, scooped, some, of, the, beans, inside, once, he, was, sure, no, one, was, watching, him, however, just, as, soon, as, he, placed, on, his, hat, to, hide, the, beans, he, saw, aso, enter, the, room, startled, anansi, hatched, up, another, plan, and, told, aso, that, a, hat, shaking, festival, was, taking, place, in, his, father, s, village, he, intended, to, go, there, himself, aso, became, suspicious, and, asked, anansi, why, he, had, not, told, her, of, the, festival, before, she, reminded, him, that, he, had, not, eaten, anything, and, advised, the, spider, to, wait, until, the, next, day, however, anansi, refused, to, listen, to, his, wife, s, advice, and, she, stormed, off, aso, gathered, the, people, in, the, village, and, told, them, what, anansi, was, planning, so, they, could, hopefully, keep, him, from, leaving, and, then, headed, back, to, her, husband, anansi, saw, aso, returning, with, the, crowd, and, grabbed, his, hat, singing, just, now, at, my, father, s, village, they, are, shaking, hats, saworowa, they, are, shaking, hats, e, they, are, shaking, hats, o, they, are, shaking, hats, saworowa, anansi, began, to, panic, because, the, beans, in, his, leopard, s, hat, were, burning, him, and, he, told, them, he, was, leaving, and, would, not, remain, whatsoever, anansi, left, but, the, villagers, followed, him, even, when, he, told, them, to, leave, in, panic, he, sang, again, turn, back, because, just, now, at, my, father, s, village, they, are, shaking, hats, saworowa, they, are, shaking, hats, e, they, are, shaking, hats, o, they, are, shaking, hats, saworowa, now, the, beans, were, unbearably, hot, upon, his, head, so, anansi, threw, his, hat, with, its, beans, away, when, aso, realized, what, anansi, had, done, she, and, the, villagers, booed, him, and, he, ran, away, down, the, road, he, promised, the, road, that, he, would, thank, it, if, it, helped, him, escape, and, it, agreed, to, leading, him, away, from, the, villagers, and, to, medicine, he, could, use, so, it, is, that, anansi, has, a, bald, head, from, the, airs, he, gave, himself, during, his, mother, in, law, s, funeral, one, day, kwaku, anansi, went, to, okraman, the, dog, and, told, him, he, wished, to, build, a, new, village, to, live, in, 138, 140, okraman, heard, anansi, s, suggestion, and, agreed, with, it, and, anansi, then, explained, his, plan, okraman, was, to, collect, a, rope, creeper, on, the, monday, following, the, next, sunday, adae, anansi, would, do, the, same, and, the, two, would, then, meet, together, anansi, told, okraman, that, he, would, gather, a, gourd, and, fill, it, with, water, and, wished, the, dog, to, do, so, also, the, pair, would, have, water, in, case, their, destination, lacked, it, okraman, agreed, again, and, the, two, both, prepared, once, the, sunday, adae, began, anansi, even, put, honey, into, his, gourd, for, extra, measure, then, the, two, traveled, the, next, monday, okraman, and, anansi, had, reached, the, half, way, point, on, their, journey, when, the, two, became, exhausted, and, the, dog, recommended, they, both, rest, for, a, moment, and, drink, some, of, the, water, they, d, prepared, then, anansi, suggested, that, they, play, a, game, to, pass, the, time, while, they, rested, okraman, asked, the, spider, which, type, of, game, he, wished, to, play, and, anansi, replied, that, he, wished, to, play, a, binding, game, anansi, then, explained, the, rules, of, the, game, okraman, would, tie, anansi, and, then, anansi, would, tie, okraman, anansi, would, give, okraman, a, signal, and, the, dog, would, try, to, escape, his, bindings, okraman, however, wanted, anansi, to, tie, him, first, anansi, disagreed, scolding, the, dog, and, reminded, okraman, that, he, was, his, elder, causing, okraman, to, accept, anansi, s, terms, in, their, game, thus, the, two, began, and, okraman, tied, anansi, first, however, anansi, did, not, know, that, okraman, was, also, hungry, and, had, no, true, desire, to, play, anansi, s, game, instead, the, dog, bound, anansi, and, carried, him, away, hoping, to, sell, the, spider, for, food, once, anansi, realized, okraman, s, plan, he, began, mourning, but, the, dog, paid, him, no, mind, continuing, to, carry, anansi, away, until, they, both, reached, a, stream, soon, someone, else, noticed, anansi, s, cries, and, came, to, investigate, them, odenkyem, the, crocodile, he, asked, okraman, about, the, matter, but, the, dog, was, too, frightened, to, respond, instead, okraman, dropped, anansi, and, fled, while, odenkyem, freed, anansi, from, his, bindings, anansi, thanked, the, crocodile, and, asked, if, there, was, a, means, he, could, repay, him, for, his, kindness, but, odenkyem, said, that, he, didn, t, want, anything, in, return, yet, anansi, was, insistent, and, told, odenkyem, that, if, he, had, children, he, would, come, and, style, them, dressing, their, hair, so, that, they, could, be, very, beautiful, odenkyem, accepted, this, and, did, not, suspect, anansi, s, deception, anansi, returned, home, after, speaking, to, the, crocodile, and, told, his, wife, aso, that, he, needed, palm, nuts, and, onions, for, a, stew, he, planned, to, make, he, d, bring, a, crocodile, back, to, supply, meat, for, it, aso, did, so, while, anansi, gathered, a, knife, sharpening, it, he, mashed, some, eto, and, carried, it, with, him, to, the, stream, where, odenkyem, lived, next, anansi, called, out, to, odenkyem, and, told, the, crocodile, that, he, d, prepared, a, reward, for, him, sitting, the, eto, in, the, water, odenkyem, heard, anansi, and, soon, came, ready, to, accept, anansi, s, gift, however, the, spider, had, tricked, him, anansi, withdrew, his, knife, and, cut, the, crocodile, with, it, but, the, blow, he, dealt, to, odenkyem, was, not, fatal, anansi, didn, t, realize, this, however, and, left, for, home, without, a, second, thought, aso, noticed, anansi, didn, t, have, the, crocodile, he, d, promised, to, bring, home, to, prepare, stew, and, asked, him, where, it, was, but, anansi, became, defensive, scolding, his, wife, for, bothering, him, when, he, d, just, returned, home, aso, however, saw, through, anansi, s, attitude, and, told, her, husband, that, she, could, tell, he, had, not, gotten, odenkyem, like, he, d, planned, anansi, could, only, remain, silent, and, said, nothing, else, about, the, matter, for, the, remainder, of, the, evening, morning, began, and, aso, told, anansi, she, was, going, to, the, river, the, crocodile, was, still, laying, there, when, she, arrived, and, flies, now, surrounded, him, aso, took, note, of, this, and, told, anansi, what, she, d, observed, when, she, returned, to, their, home, anansi, explained, to, aso, that, he, d, used, a, special, medicine, to, kill, odenkyem, and, thus, had, to, wait, until, the, next, day, before, he, collected, his, kill, he, then, thanked, her, for, confirming, the, crocodile, had, died, and, set, about, for, the, stream, on, his, own, with, a, stick, he, d, prepared, for, defense, anansi, soon, arrived, and, noticed, odenkyem, was, still, laying, in, the, riverbank, he, carefully, strode, over, to, the, crocodile, s, body, poking, him, with, his, stick, then, anansi, prodded, odenkyem, s, body, and, asked, the, crocodile, if, he, was, dead, shifting, his, body, over, as, he, examined, him, but, odenkyem, did, not, respond, little, did, anansi, know, that, the, crocodile, may, have, been, motionless, but, he, was, far, from, deceased, anansi, eventually, stopped, prodding, the, crocodile, with, his, stick, convinced, he, was, dead, and, edged, closer, to, odenkyem, s, body, stretching, his, hand, out, to, check, the, crocodile, a, final, time, yet, anansi, s, action, would, prove, to, be, a, mistake, for, he, immediately, found, himself, trapped, between, the, crocodile, s, jaws, when, he, clasped, the, spider, unexpectedly, after, a, great, contest, between, the, two, anansi, wiggled, himself, free, from, odenkyem, and, fled, the, river, rushing, back, home, so, it, is, that, anansi, always, runs, while, crossing, the, water, careful, to, never, give, odenkyem, another, chance, to, capture, him, again, one, day, ekuo, and, sogblen, went, to, go, visit, anansi, however, when, they, knocked, on, his, door, anansi, didn, t, answer, and, instead, told, his, wife, aso, to, answer, when, ekuo, asked, where, anansi, was, aso, said, that, he, was, upstairs, however, anansi, had, webbed, up, the, floor, in, front, of, the, door, and, hid, under, his, bed, holding, a, web, silk, so, that, when, sogblen, entered, the, room, he, tugged, on, the, silk, setting, off, the, trap, trapping, sogblen, in, webs, ekuo, came, in, next, but, anansi, was, prepared, so, he, came, out, disguised, as, his, son, he, said, that, anansi, had, jumped, out, of, the, window, and, when, ekuo, looked, outside, anansi, pushed, him, out, and, into, another, trap, which, was, a, web, that, wrapped, around, ekuo, with, only, three, silks, hanging, from, the, roof, suspending, ekuo, in, the, air, anasi, then, revealed, himself, and, robbed, sogblen, of, some, of, the, yams, he, was, carrying, and, took, ekuo, s, cowries, before, going, downstairs, he, went, to, a, rice, field, nearby, and, ate, the, yams, before, going, to, buy, something, with, the, cowries, meanwhile, ekuo, told, his, spear, to, free, him, from, his, trap, then, free, sogblen, they, then, asked, aso, if, she, had, seen, anansi, leave, and, she, said, that, she, had, seen, him, leave, the, house, in, the, direction, of, a, rice, field, ekuo, and, sogblen, went, there, and, saw, anansi, s, footprints, trailed, off, to, the, market, so, they, followed, them, anansi, saw, the, two, coming, and, hid, in, a, herd, of, cows, however, ekuo, was, interested, in, buying, one, of, the, cows, and, eventually, saw, anansi, they, grabbed, him, and, brought, him, out, into, public, where, they, shamed, him, for, his, lack, of, hospitality, anansi, humbled, walked, home, where, he, had, a, meal, alone, while, ekuo, and, sogblen, bought, a, cow, killed, it, and, had, a, public, feast, one, day, anansi, was, hungry, and, had, no, food, he, saw, wansena, the, fly, eating, kenkey, outside, of, his, house, anansi, went, outside, and, asked, for, some, but, the, fly, refused, saying, that, instead, he, would, lead, him, to, an, area, with, an, abundance, of, food, wansena, told, anansi, to, follow, him, and, he, led, him, to, a, village, in, the, jungle, where, they, produced, a, large, amount, of, kenkey, wansena, told, him, that, this, was, his, home, village, and, so, other, flies, lived, there, anansi, ate, a, lot, of, kenkey, but, he, was, still, hungry, although, wansena, told, him, that, he, couldn, t, have, any, more, anansi, angry, decided, to, set, up, a, trap, he, wove, webs, around, the, village, and, covered, them, in, a, sweet, smelling, substance, whilst, the, villagers, were, sleeping, when, they, woke, one, by, one, they, were, attracted, to, the, smell, and, trapped, in, the, web, when, all, of, them, were, trapped, anansi, ate, all, of, the, kenkey, in, the, village, until, he, was, full, before, climbing, his, webs, and, going, home, carrying, even, more, kenkey, with, him, and, that, is, why, anansi, s, webs, trap, flies, one, day, anansi, was, very, hungry, and, couldn, t, find, anything, to, eat, he, decided, to, take, a, basket, along, with, a, large, pot, and, headed, toward, seaside, to, go, fishing, the, spider, then, made, a, fire, for, his, pot, and, called, out, to, the, sea, hey, big, fish, come, huge, fish, came, and, he, caught, some, of, them, placing, them, in, his, basket, anansi, shouted, big, fish, go, make, little, fish, come, next, scaring, the, big, fish, away, smaller, fish, then, came, and, he, caught, them, also, placing, them, in, his, basket, anansi, repeated, this, until, he, filled, both, his, pot, and, basket, with, a, variety, of, fish, then, sat, his, basket, aside, anansi, spared, no, time, cooking, all, of, the, fish, he, d, captured, inside, his, pot, and, ate, them, anansi, then, collected, his, things, once, he, was, full, and, headed, back, toward, his, home, hiding, his, now, empty, pot, in, a, bush, along, the, way, eventually, anansi, met, tiger, on, his, trek, back, home, and, was, frightened, because, tiger, was, very, intimidating, tiger, demanded, to, know, what, anansi, had, in, his, basket, anansi, replied, in, a, feeble, voice, that, his, basket, was, empty, tiger, let, the, spider, go, about, his, way, but, remained, suspicious, of, anansi, and, decided, to, spy, on, the, spider, once, the, two, had, gained, some, distance, between, each, other, tiger, watched, as, anansi, soon, sat, near, a, tree, and, opened, the, basket, with, the, fish, he, d, caught, earlier, that, day, next, anansi, began, to, remove, each, of, the, fish, he, d, caught, and, gloated, over, them, first, a, yellow, tail, then, a, snapper, and, finally, a, jack, fish, tiger, then, sprung, out, of, hiding, and, confronted, anansi, about, his, deception, tiger, caught, anansi, in, his, lie, and, noted, that, the, spider, had, said, he, didn, t, have, any, fish, when, they, d, last, spoke, anansi, made, an, excuse, however, and, said, that, he, d, gone, to, take, a, bath, after, they, met, and, caught, some, fish, while, he, was, out, bathing, tiger, thus, demanded, that, anansi, give, him, all, of, the, fish, he, d, caught, and, the, spider, obeyed, tiger, devoured, all, of, anansi, s, fish, and, left, only, the, bones, for, anansi, to, eat, who, took, them, up, reluctantly, and, ate, those, instead, anansi, complained, under, his, breath, that, all, of, his, hard, work, had, gone, to, waste, and, decided, to, spy, on, tiger, planning, to, trick, him, the, two, continued, down, the, road, and, saw, a, fruit, tree, knowing, tiger, was, greedy, anansi, remarked, that, there, were, pretty, fruit, in, the, tree, tiger, ordered, anansi, to, climb, the, tree, and, fetch, some, of, the, fruit, unaware, of, anansi, s, plot, anansi, conceded, anansi, reached, the, top, of, the, fruit, tree, and, noticed, tiger, was, standing, directly, beneath, him, the, spider, warned, tiger, that, he, could, see, lice, in, his, hair, tiger, fell, for, anansi, s, ruse, and, demanded, that, anansi, catch, the, lice, for, him, but, anansi, told, tiger, that, he, needed, him, to, lean, against, the, tree, first, tiger, agreed, and, anansi, came, down, pretending, to, search, for, the, lice, he, claimed, to, have, seen, soon, his, scheme, was, successful, tiger, fell, asleep, while, anansi, did, so, because, of, how, long, it, was, and, the, spider, wasted, no, time, tying, tiger, s, hair, to, the, fruit, tree, when, he, was, finished, anansi, woke, tiger, and, told, him, that, he, couldn, t, find, any, other, lice, in, his, hair, tiger, demanded, that, anansi, capture, them, all, but, anansi, refused, to, help, him, tiger, tried, to, attack, anansi, in, anger, but, was, stuck, tiger, realized, what, anansi, had, really, done, while, he, was, asleep, and, ordered, anansi, to, untie, his, hair, but, anansi, refused, to, and, taunted, tiger, bragging, that, he, d, tied, him, like, a, hog, anansi, was, no, longer, afraid, of, tiger, and, left, his, rival, behind, heading, home, tiger, however, was, not, so, lucky, a, hunter, soon, saw, tiger, by, the, fruit, tree, and, killed, him, it, came, about, that, anansi, became, friends, with, dew, and, that, they, both, helped, each, other, develop, their, own, crops, 105, 107, one, day, anansi, saw, his, friend, dew, s, crop, and, noticed, the, corn, dew, grew, was, much, finer, than, his, own, anansi, became, very, jealous, of, dew, and, craved, the, corn, that, dew, had, grown, more, than, his, own, so, he, decided, he, would, trick, dew, anansi, approached, dew, and, bragged, saying, that, his, corn, was, better, than, dew, s, and, suggested, that, dew, cut, his, corn, so, it, would, be, as, fine, as, his, anansi, promised, dew, that, if, he, cut, his, own, crop, his, corn, would, grow, back, and, be, the, same, quality, as, anansi, s, corn, was, anansi, however, was, lying, nonetheless, dew, fell, for, the, spider, s, schemes, and, agreed, to, cut, his, corn, crop, in, the, mistaken, belief, that, his, corn, would, grow, again, later, that, evening, neighbors, in, their, village, saw, dew, s, corn, had, been, cut, down, and, wondered, why, he, did, so, noting, that, the, corn, he, had, was, very, fine, once, they, asked, dew, who, d, convinced, him, to, cut, down, his, corn, crop, and, he, replied, that, anansi, had, convinced, him, to, do, so, in, the, hopes, that, his, corn, crop, would, be, better, than, it, was, before, the, neighbors, sighed, and, told, dew, that, he, d, been, tricked, for, his, corn, would, not, grow, again, this, upset, dew, but, he, promised, them, that, he, would, trick, anansi, just, as, he, had, tricked, him, dew, however, would, trick, anansi, with, his, mother, instead, of, with, corn, like, anansi, had, him, as, time, passed, dew, worked, especially, hard, and, tirelessly, to, build, up, a, large, amount, of, wealth, he, bought, a, scythe, hoe, axe, new, clothes, and, other, equipment, dew, then, told, his, mother, his, plan, he, would, tell, anansi, that, she, had, died, and, would, then, make, a, mock, coffin, in, which, to, bury, her, in, the, meanwhile, dew, wished, for, his, mother, to, hide, in, their, home, upstairs, while, he, prepared, so, she, did, dew, then, made, a, coffin, and, announced, her, death, to, the, village, inviting, them, to, come, see, her, burial, once, they, had, arrived, he, snuck, his, mother, from, upstairs, and, had, her, hide, underneath, the, floor, where, the, mock, coffin, lay, as, well, as, the, many, things, he, d, purchased, as, he, knew, anansi, s, greed, would, spurn, him, to, steal, from, dew, if, he, saw, them, laying, around, now, that, the, plan, was, in, order, it, was, time, for, the, mock, burial, to, begin, dew, began, to, cry, and, lament, that, his, mother, had, died, so, suddenly, and, left, him, nothing, to, remember, her, by, on, cue, dew, s, mother, extended, the, scythe, and, other, tools, he, d, purchased, through, the, plank, in, the, floor, anansi, saw, what, was, happening, and, grew, jealous, of, dew, wishing, his, very, own, mother, was, dead, so, he, could, get, what, dew, was, getting, from, his, own, mother, as, well, dew, continued, to, mourn, and, lamented, that, he, longed, for, a, blessing, from, her, in, the, form, of, money, so, dew, s, mother, took, the, money, he, had, also, given, her, alongside, the, equipment, and, threw, it, through, the, floor, at, him, also, thus, his, display, was, successful, the, burial, they, d, staged, went, well, and, those, who, had, come, to, mourn, his, mother, s, passing, went, back, to, their, homes, anansi, s, jealousy, of, dew, caused, him, to, bicker, with, his, own, mother, for, days, on, all, matter, of, issues, then, one, day, they, were, arguing, and, the, spider, asked, his, mother, why, she, herself, couldn, t, have, died, just, like, dew, s, mother, did, soon, the, arguments, reached, a, climactic, point, and, anansi, smote, his, own, mother, with, a, stick, in, a, fit, of, rage, anansi, s, mother, then, died, and, he, soon, set, about, preparing, for, her, burial, just, as, dew, had, before, him, then, came, time, for, the, funeral, and, anansi, cried, just, as, dew, had, and, told, her, all, the, things, dew, had, told, his, mother, while, grieving, yet, nothing, that, he, told, his, mother, no, matter, how, much, he, cried, caused, her, to, do, the, things, that, dew, s, mother, had, done, for, her, son, the, funeral, was, a, failure, so, anansi, went, ahead, with, his, mother, s, burial, about, a, week, passed, and, dew, had, his, mother, come, visit, him, while, he, worked, outside, in, the, fields, anansi, noticed, dew, s, mother, had, come, and, asked, if, the, woman, he, saw, was, in, fact, her, dew, replied, that, it, was, his, own, mother, and, that, it, was, payback, for, anansi, deceiving, dew, about, his, corn, crops, dew, then, bragged, that, he, instead, had, tricked, anansi, about, his, motherwell, rather, than, his, corn, and, such, was, true, dew, s, mother, was, still, alive, but, anansi, s, mother, was, now, dead, because, of, his, own, jealousy, one, morning, anansi, was, very, hungry, and, needed, food, 121, he, went, to, the, bush, and, spoke, with, his, friend, hunter, and, told, hunter, his, dilemma, asking, hunter, if, he, could, have, gun, hunter, did, so, and, gave, the, spider, his, gun, then, anansi, set, about, to, concoct, a, scheme, to, obtain, food, he, told, the, animals, in, the, village, that, it, was, time, for, them, to, bury, gun, their, arch, enemy, for, gun, had, died, the, animals, knew, gun, was, very, evil, for, he, had, been, killing, many, of, them, whenever, he, went, through, the, bush, thus, when, word, of, gun, s, passing, reached, them, the, animals, all, rejoiced, and, agreed, that, they, would, come, to, celebrate, gun, s, death, when, anansi, buried, him, while, the, animals, gathered, to, meet, at, gun, s, funeral, anansi, set, a, trap, for, them, anansi, made, each, of, the, animals, pass, in, front, of, gun, s, coffin, during, the, funeral, while, he, and, his, children, claimed, that, they, would, carry, gun, to, be, buried, he, pointed, gun, at, them, all, while, they, remained, oblivious, to, his, true, plan, soon, all, those, anansi, had, called, to, the, funeral, were, lined, up, in, front, of, gun, s, coffin, and, anansi, then, struck, anansi, began, using, gun, to, kill, each, of, the, animals, that, had, arrived, until, none, else, were, alive, or, able, to, escape, anansi, then, took, their, meat, when, the, deed, was, done, and, was, able, to, feed, his, family, with, it, anansi, went, to, the, king, one, evening, and, asked, him, if, he, could, become, a, preacher, the, king, entertained, anansi, s, offer, and, said, that, if, he, wished, he, could, preach, the, following, sunday, 110, 111, so, anansi, prepared, himself, a, sermon, and, on, that, sunday, he, preached, a, message, however, the, king, was, busy, that, morning, and, could, not, come, to, hear, anansi, s, sermon, the, king, thus, told, anansi, that, he, wished, him, to, preach, again, the, following, sunday, and, he, gave, him, a, black, suit, that, he, wished, for, the, spider, to, wear, when, he, did, it, is, said, that, anansi, lived, beside, cockroach, and, that, between, their, homes, was, a, fence, that, divided, them, in, addition, to, this, was, a, coconut, tree, that, grew, in, cockroach, s, yard, however, it, was, a, tree, with, branches, covered, in, coconuts, some, of, which, hung, over, the, fence, above, anansi, s, yard, anansi, saw, them, hanging, on, his, side, of, the, yard, one, day, and, took, a, machete, he, then, cut, the, bunch, of, coconuts, directly, in, half, and, took, the, ones, that, hung, on, his, side, of, the, fence, for, himself, cockroach, noticed, this, and, took, great, offense, at, anansi, asking, him, why, he, d, taken, the, fruit, from, his, tree, as, it, clearly, belonged, to, him, anansi, agreed, that, the, tree, belonged, to, cockroach, but, replied, that, the, coconuts, he, d, cut, down, were, hanging, extremely, low, the, spider, explained, that, he, only, took, the, half, that, hung, on, his, side, but, cockroach, did, not, accept, anansi, s, excuse, he, vowed, to, get, even, with, anansi, for, what, he, d, done, soon, it, was, saturday, and, anansi, would, then, have, to, preach, before, the, king, the, next, morning, anansi, asked, his, wife, if, she, could, clean, his, black, suit, so, that, it, would, be, ready, in, time, for, the, sermon, and, she, agreed, his, wife, took, the, black, suit, the, king, had, given, him, and, then, hung, it, outside, to, dry, cockroach, however, noticed, this, taking, place, and, saw, that, half, of, anansi, s, suit, hung, above, the, fence, separating, his, yard, from, anansi, s, cockroach, then, took, his, own, machete, and, eager, to, enact, vengeance, anansi, for, cutting, his, coconut, fruit, cut, the, half, of, anansi, s, suit, that, hung, over, his, yard, off, the, next, morning, it, was, time, to, preach, but, anansi, saw, what, had, happened, to, his, suit, and, was, unable, to, meet, the, king, and, deliver, his, sermon, the, king, thus, did, not, get, to, hear, anansi, preach, at, all, and, became, very, angry, in, a, fit, he, had, anansi, arrested, and, saw, to, it, that, the, spider, was, thrown, into, jail, for, offending, him, soon, anansi, s, time, was, served, and, the, next, time, he, saw, cockroach, again, the, spider, told, him, that, he, would, never, forgive, cockroach, for, his, treachery, he, would, never, forget, it, for, as, long, as, he, lived, for, cockroach, s, actions, had, cost, him, the, job, he, wanted, so, it, was, that, anansi, tried, and, failed, to, become, a, preacher, and, cockroach, became, anansi, s, enemy, a, very, long, time, ago, death, had, no, presence, for, he, had, not, come, to, the, cities, yet, 111, 113, death, preferred, to, live, deep, inside, a, village, in, the, bush, but, a, famine, came, one, day, and, made, anansi, very, hungry, so, he, took, gun, along, with, his, hunting, bag, and, decided, to, hunt, for, food, anansi, searched, throughout, the, bush, but, soon, found, that, there, were, no, animals, he, could, find, in, the, bush, to, eat, anansi, however, did, not, give, up, instead, anansi, continued, to, venture, deep, within, the, bush, searching, for, animals, to, hunt, and, stumbled, upon, the, village, that, death, lived, in, and, death, was, seated, in, front, of, its, entrance, anansi, did, not, want, to, offend, death, so, he, approached, him, and, greeted, him, first, anansi, then, told, death, his, plight, and, noted, that, he, had, searched, throughout, the, bush, for, an, animal, to, kill, for, food, but, had, found, none, death, told, anansi, he, could, come, into, his, village, and, he, would, cook, food, for, him, inside, the, village, death, brought, anansi, to, the, house, where, meat, was, cooked, and, anansi, saw, that, death, had, a, great, amount, anansi, became, enticed, by, all, of, the, meat, that, death, was, cooking, and, saw, that, an, enormous, amount, remained, even, after, death, let, the, spider, have, his, fill, of, it, to, eat, anansi, thanked, death, for, his, hospitality, but, was, still, curious, how, death, had, acquired, such, an, impressive, amount, of, meat, and, asked, him, afterward, death, asked, anansi, if, he, didn, t, recognize, who, he, was, and, the, spider, responded, that, he, did, realizing, why, he, had, not, been, able, to, find, meat, in, the, bush, death, owned, it, all, anansi, thus, asked, death, for, a, favor, explaining, that, he, had, come, to, the, bush, so, that, he, could, find, food, for, his, family, during, the, famine, anansi, wished, to, bring, some, meat, back, to, them, and, asked, for, death, s, permission, to, do, so, death, agreed, and, gave, anansi, meat, that, he, could, provide, to, his, family, anansi, took, the, meat, that, death, gave, him, and, returned, from, the, bush, to, his, village, in, the, city, where, he, met, his, family, again, and, told, them, of, his, discovery, he, told, his, wife, that, he, could, go, to, visit, death, and, take, meat, when, necessary, however, anansi, s, greed, overcame, him, and, he, told, her, that, he, could, even, steal, meat, from, death, thus, instead, of, asking, like, he, had, before, anansi, returned, to, death, s, village, while, he, was, away, and, stole, meat, from, him, anansi, s, scheme, would, not, last, for, death, noticed, that, meat, was, missing, from, his, village, although, he, did, not, know, who, d, stolen, it, death, decided, to, wait, in, secret, to, see, if, he, could, discover, who, the, thief, was, anansi, came, to, death, s, village, one, day, completely, unaware, that, he, was, still, present, and, then, gathered, a, large, basket, of, meat, from, his, stores, as, he, normally, did, death, immediately, surprised, anansi, and, asked, him, why, he, had, chosen, to, steal, from, him, but, anansi, was, too, afraid, to, answer, his, question, instead, anansi, fled, death, s, village, and, death, soon, chased, after, him, try, as, he, might, anansi, could, not, lose, death, no, matter, how, fast, he, ran, through, the, bush, and, by, the, time, anansi, had, reached, the, city, the, spider, looked, behind, him, and, saw, that, death, was, still, close, to, reaching, him, anansi, then, cried, out, to, the, people, that, death, was, coming, and, that, they, should, shut, their, doors, if, they, wished, to, live, yet, many, people, could, not, shut, their, doors, in, time, and, death, took, them, so, it, is, that, death, now, lives, in, the, city, had, anansi, not, stolen, from, him, death, would, still, remain, quietly, in, the, bush, where, no, one, could, find, it, anansi, shares, similarities, with, the, trickster, figure, of, br, er, rabbit, who, originated, from, the, folklore, of, the, bantu, speaking, peoples, of, south, and, central, africa, enslaved, africans, brought, the, br, er, rabbit, tales, to, the, new, world, which, like, the, anansi, stories, depict, a, physically, small, and, vulnerable, creature, using, his, cunning, intelligence, to, prevail, over, larger, animals, however, although, br, er, rabbit, stories, are, told, in, the, caribbean, especially, in, the, french, speaking, islands, where, he, is, named, compair, lapin, he, is, predominantly, an, african, american, folk, hero, the, rabbit, as, a, trickster, is, also, in, akan, versions, as, well, and, a, bantu, origin, doesn, t, have, to, be, the, main, source, at, least, for, the, caribbean, where, the, akan, people, are, more, dominant, than, in, the, u, s, his, tales, entered, the, mainstream, through, the, work, of, the, american, journalist, joel, chandler, harris, who, wrote, several, collections, of, uncle, remus, stories, between, 1870, and, 1906, one, of, the, times, anansi, himself, was, tricked, was, when, he, tried, to, fight, a, tar, baby, after, trying, to, steal, food, but, became, stuck, to, it, instead, it, is, a, tale, well, known, from, a, version, involving, br, er, rabbit, found, in, the, uncle, remus, stories, and, adapted, and, used, in, the, 1946, live, action, animated, walt, disney, movie, song, of, the, south, these, were, derived, from, african, american, folktales, in, the, southern, united, states, that, had, part, of, their, origin, in, african, folktales, preserved, in, oral, storytelling, by, african, americans, elements, of, the, african, anansi, tale, were, combined, by, african, american, storytellers, with, elements, from, native, american, tales, such, as, the, cherokee, story, of, the, tar, wolf, which, had, a, similar, theme, but, often, had, a, trickster, rabbit, as, a, protagonist, the, native, american, trickster, rabbit, appears, to, have, resonated, with, african, american, story, tellers, and, was, adopted, as, a, cognate, of, the, anansi, character, with, which, they, were, familiar, other, authorities, state, the, widespread, existence, of, similar, stories, of, a, rabbit, and, tar, baby, throughout, indigenous, meso, american, and, south, american, cultures, thus, the, tale, of, br, er, rabbit, and, the, tar, baby, represents, a, coming, together, of, two, separate, folk, traditions, american, and, african, which, coincidentally, shared, a, common, theme, most, of, the, other, br, er, rabbit, stories, originated, with, cherokee, or, algonquian, myths, in, the, usa, today, the, stories, of, br, er, rabbit, exist, alongside, other, stories, of, aunt, nancy, and, of, anansi, himself, coming, from, both, the, times, of, slavery, and, also, from, the, caribbean, and, directly, from, africa, anansi, is, often, depicted, in, popular, tales, interacting, with, the, supreme, being, and, other, deities, who, frequently, bestow, him, with, temporary, supernatural, powers, such, as, the, ability, to, bring, rain, or, to, have, other, duties, performed, for, him, some, folkloric, traditions, portray, anansi, as, the, son, of, the, earth, mother, asase, yaa, in, others, anansi, is, sometimes, also, considered, an, abosom, lesser, deity, in, akan, spirituality, despite, being, commonly, recognized, as, a, trickster, thus, kwaku, anansi, is, similar, to, legba, who, is, also, both, a, trickster, and, a, deity, in, west, african, vodun, however, akan, spirituality, writ, large, does, not, generally, consider, anansi, as, an, abosom, to, the, same, extent, that, other, established, african, trickster, deities, are, worshiped, in, their, respective, religions, his, connection, to, the, sacred, is, ultimately, believed, to, be, folkloric, in, regards, to, his, importance, in, akan, society, in, essence, among, the, akan, anansi, and, his, stories, are, folkloric, creations, used, to, convey, moral, truths, and, give, anecdotal, explanations, for, natural, phenomena, and, occurances, this, is, supported, by, his, limited, use, outside, of, storytelling, including, his, absence, as, a, totem, animal, nevertheless, those, who, do, recognize, anansi, in, a, religious, context, in, akan, spirituality, acknowledge, him, as, the, obosom, of, wisdom, he, is, even, said, to, have, created, the, first, inanimate, human, body, according, to, the, scholar, anthony, ephirim, donkor, in, the, new, world, on, the, other, hand, alternative, religious, views, of, anansi, have, greater, prominence, in, addition, to, his, role, as, a, folkloric, character, followers, of, haitian, vodou, for, example, honor, him, as, a, guede, lwa, anansi, being, a, guede, lwa, is, a, little, bit, different, from, the, average, lwa, as, he, belongs, to, the, guede, family, of, loa, the, guede, family, represent, the, concept, of, death, and, fertility, it, is, for, this, reason, that, many, people, call, anansi, a, guede, lwa, as, he, is, the, one, who, is, responsible, for, maintaining, the, many, connections, between, the, living, beings, of, the, known, world, and, the, spirits, of, those, that, have, passed, away, the, anancy, festival, was, created, by, xavier, murphy, the, founder, of, jamaicans, com, educator, cathy, kleinhans, and, dr, andrea, shaw, nevins, the, dean, of, farquhar, honors, college, at, nova, southeastern, university, to, connect, children, of, caribbean, descent, with, the, traditions, of, their, ancestors, through, stories, song, dance, arts, and, crafts, book, and, poetry, readings, and, other, art, forms, the, first, anancy, festival, was, held, in, pembroke, pines, florida, on, june, 30, 2007, children, s,
