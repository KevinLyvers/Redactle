free, will, is, the, capacity, or, ability, to, choose, between, different, possible, courses, of, action, free, will, is, closely, linked, to, the, concepts, of, moral, responsibility, praise, culpability, and, other, judgements, which, apply, only, to, actions, that, are, freely, chosen, it, is, also, connected, with, the, concepts, of, advice, persuasion, deliberation, and, prohibition, traditionally, only, actions, that, are, freely, willed, are, seen, as, deserving, credit, or, blame, whether, free, will, exists, what, it, is, and, the, implications, of, whether, it, exists, or, not, constitute, some, of, the, longest, running, debates, of, philosophy, some, conceive, of, free, will, as, the, ability, to, act, beyond, the, limits, of, external, influences, or, wishes, some, conceive, free, will, to, be, the, capacity, to, make, choices, undetermined, by, past, events, determinism, suggests, that, only, one, course, of, events, is, possible, which, is, inconsistent, with, a, libertarian, model, of, free, will, ancient, greek, philosophy, identified, this, issue, which, remains, a, major, focus, of, philosophical, debate, the, view, that, posits, free, will, as, incompatible, with, determinism, is, called, incompatibilism, and, encompasses, both, metaphysical, libertarianism, the, claim, that, determinism, is, false, and, thus, free, will, is, at, least, possible, and, hard, determinism, the, claim, that, determinism, is, true, and, thus, free, will, is, not, possible, another, incompatibilist, position, is, hard, incompatibilism, which, holds, not, only, determinism, but, also, indeterminism, to, be, incompatible, with, free, will, and, thus, free, will, to, be, impossible, whatever, the, case, may, be, regarding, determinism, in, contrast, compatibilists, hold, that, free, will, is, compatible, with, determinism, some, compatibilists, even, hold, that, determinism, is, necessary, for, free, will, arguing, that, choice, involves, preference, for, one, course, of, action, over, another, requiring, a, sense, of, how, choices, will, turn, out, compatibilists, thus, consider, the, debate, between, libertarians, and, hard, determinists, over, free, will, vs, determinism, a, false, dilemma, different, compatibilists, offer, very, different, definitions, of, what, free, will, means, and, consequently, find, different, types, of, constraints, to, be, relevant, to, the, issue, classical, compatibilists, considered, free, will, nothing, more, than, freedom, of, action, considering, one, free, of, will, simply, if, had, one, counterfactually, wanted, to, do, otherwise, one, could, have, done, otherwise, without, physical, impediment, many, contemporary, compatibilists, instead, identify, free, will, as, a, psychological, capacity, such, as, to, direct, one, s, behavior, in, a, way, responsive, to, reason, and, there, are, still, further, different, conceptions, of, free, will, each, with, their, own, concerns, sharing, only, the, common, feature, of, not, finding, the, possibility, of, determinism, a, threat, to, the, possibility, of, free, will, the, problem, of, free, will, has, been, identified, in, ancient, greek, philosophical, literature, the, notion, of, compatibilist, free, will, has, been, attributed, to, both, aristotle, 4th, century, bce, and, epictetus, 1st, century, ce, it, was, the, fact, that, nothing, hindered, us, from, doing, or, choosing, something, that, made, us, have, control, over, them, according, to, susanne, bobzien, the, notion, of, incompatibilist, free, will, is, perhaps, first, identified, in, the, works, of, alexander, of, aphrodisias, 3rd, century, ce, what, makes, us, have, control, over, things, is, the, fact, that, we, are, causally, undetermined, in, our, decision, and, thus, can, freely, decide, between, doing, choosing, or, not, doing, choosing, them, the, term, free, will, liberum, arbitrium, was, introduced, by, christian, philosophy, 4th, century, ce, it, has, traditionally, meant, until, the, enlightenment, proposed, its, own, meanings, lack, of, necessity, in, human, will, so, that, the, will, is, free, meant, the, will, does, not, have, to, be, such, as, it, is, this, requirement, was, universally, embraced, by, both, incompatibilists, and, compatibilists, the, underlying, questions, are, whether, we, have, control, over, our, actions, and, if, so, what, sort, of, control, and, to, what, extent, these, questions, predate, the, early, greek, stoics, for, example, chrysippus, and, some, modern, philosophers, lament, the, lack, of, progress, over, all, these, centuries, on, one, hand, humans, have, a, strong, sense, of, freedom, which, leads, them, to, believe, that, they, have, free, will, on, the, other, hand, an, intuitive, feeling, of, free, will, could, be, mistaken, it, is, difficult, to, reconcile, the, intuitive, evidence, that, conscious, decisions, are, causally, effective, with, the, view, that, the, physical, world, can, be, explained, entirely, by, physical, law, the, conflict, between, intuitively, felt, freedom, and, natural, law, arises, when, either, causal, closure, or, physical, determinism, nomological, determinism, is, asserted, with, causal, closure, no, physical, event, has, a, cause, outside, the, physical, domain, and, with, physical, determinism, the, future, is, determined, entirely, by, preceding, events, cause, and, effect, the, puzzle, of, reconciling, free, will, with, a, deterministic, universe, is, known, as, the, problem, of, free, will, or, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, dilemma, of, determinism, this, dilemma, leads, to, a, moral, dilemma, as, well, the, question, of, how, to, assign, responsibility, for, actions, if, they, are, caused, entirely, by, past, events, compatibilists, maintain, that, mental, reality, is, not, of, itself, causally, effective, classical, compatibilists, have, addressed, the, dilemma, of, free, will, by, arguing, that, free, will, holds, as, long, as, humans, are, not, externally, constrained, or, coerced, modern, compatibilists, make, a, distinction, between, freedom, of, will, and, freedom, of, action, that, is, separating, freedom, of, choice, from, the, freedom, to, enact, it, given, that, humans, all, experience, a, sense, of, free, will, some, modern, compatibilists, think, it, is, necessary, to, accommodate, this, intuition, compatibilists, often, associate, freedom, of, will, with, the, ability, to, make, rational, decisions, a, different, approach, to, the, dilemma, is, that, of, incompatibilists, namely, that, if, the, world, is, deterministic, then, our, feeling, that, we, are, free, to, choose, an, action, is, simply, an, illusion, metaphysical, libertarianism, is, the, form, of, incompatibilism, which, posits, that, determinism, is, false, and, free, will, is, possible, at, least, some, people, have, free, will, this, view, is, associated, with, non, materialist, constructions, including, both, traditional, dualism, as, well, as, models, supporting, more, minimal, criteria, such, as, the, ability, to, consciously, veto, an, action, or, competing, desire, yet, even, with, physical, indeterminism, arguments, have, been, made, against, libertarianism, in, that, it, is, difficult, to, assign, origination, responsibility, for, free, indeterministic, choices, free, will, here, is, predominantly, treated, with, respect, to, physical, determinism, in, the, strict, sense, of, nomological, determinism, although, other, forms, of, determinism, are, also, relevant, to, free, will, for, example, logical, and, theological, determinism, challenge, metaphysical, libertarianism, with, ideas, of, destiny, and, fate, and, biological, cultural, and, psychological, determinism, feed, the, development, of, compatibilist, models, separate, classes, of, compatibilism, and, incompatibilism, may, even, be, formed, to, represent, these, below, are, the, classic, arguments, bearing, upon, the, dilemma, and, its, underpinnings, incompatibilism, is, the, position, that, free, will, and, determinism, are, logically, incompatible, and, that, the, major, question, regarding, whether, or, not, people, have, free, will, is, thus, whether, or, not, their, actions, are, determined, hard, determinists, such, as, d, holbach, are, those, incompatibilists, who, accept, determinism, and, reject, free, will, in, contrast, metaphysical, libertarians, such, as, thomas, reid, peter, van, inwagen, and, robert, kane, are, those, incompatibilists, who, accept, free, will, and, deny, determinism, holding, the, view, that, some, form, of, indeterminism, is, true, another, view, is, that, of, hard, incompatibilists, which, state, that, free, will, is, incompatible, with, both, determinism, and, indeterminism, traditional, arguments, for, incompatibilism, are, based, on, an, intuition, pump, if, a, person, is, like, other, mechanical, things, that, are, determined, in, their, behavior, such, as, a, wind, up, toy, a, billiard, ball, a, puppet, or, a, robot, then, people, must, not, have, free, will, this, argument, has, been, rejected, by, compatibilists, such, as, daniel, dennett, on, the, grounds, that, even, if, humans, have, something, in, common, with, these, things, it, remains, possible, and, plausible, that, we, are, different, from, such, objects, in, important, ways, another, argument, for, incompatibilism, is, that, of, the, causal, chain, incompatibilism, is, key, to, the, idealist, theory, of, free, will, most, incompatibilists, reject, the, idea, that, freedom, of, action, consists, simply, in, voluntary, behavior, they, insist, rather, that, free, will, means, that, someone, must, be, the, ultimate, or, originating, cause, of, his, actions, they, must, be, causa, sui, in, the, traditional, phrase, being, responsible, for, one, s, choices, is, the, first, cause, of, those, choices, where, first, cause, means, that, there, is, no, antecedent, cause, of, that, cause, the, argument, then, is, that, if, a, person, has, free, will, then, they, are, the, ultimate, cause, of, their, actions, if, determinism, is, true, then, all, of, a, person, s, choices, are, caused, by, events, and, facts, outside, their, control, so, if, everything, someone, does, is, caused, by, events, and, facts, outside, their, control, then, they, cannot, be, the, ultimate, cause, of, their, actions, therefore, they, cannot, have, free, will, this, argument, has, also, been, challenged, by, various, compatibilist, philosophers, a, third, argument, for, incompatibilism, was, formulated, by, carl, ginet, in, the, 1960s, and, has, received, much, attention, in, the, modern, literature, the, simplified, argument, runs, along, these, lines, if, determinism, is, true, then, we, have, no, control, over, the, events, of, the, past, that, determined, our, present, state, and, no, control, over, the, laws, of, nature, since, we, can, have, no, control, over, these, matters, we, also, can, have, no, control, over, the, consequences, of, them, since, our, present, choices, and, acts, under, determinism, are, the, necessary, consequences, of, the, past, and, the, laws, of, nature, then, we, have, no, control, over, them, and, hence, no, free, will, this, is, called, the, consequence, argument, peter, van, inwagen, remarks, that, c, d, broad, had, a, version, of, the, consequence, argument, as, early, as, the, 1930s, the, difficulty, of, this, argument, for, some, compatibilists, lies, in, the, fact, that, it, entails, the, impossibility, that, one, could, have, chosen, other, than, one, has, for, example, if, jane, is, a, compatibilist, and, she, has, just, sat, down, on, the, sofa, then, she, is, committed, to, the, claim, that, she, could, have, remained, standing, if, she, had, so, desired, but, it, follows, from, the, consequence, argument, that, if, jane, had, remained, standing, she, would, have, either, generated, a, contradiction, violated, the, laws, of, nature, or, changed, the, past, hence, compatibilists, are, committed, to, the, existence, of, incredible, abilities, according, to, ginet, and, van, inwagen, one, response, to, this, argument, is, that, it, equivocates, on, the, notions, of, abilities, and, necessities, or, that, the, free, will, evoked, to, make, any, given, choice, is, really, an, illusion, and, the, choice, had, been, made, all, along, oblivious, to, its, decider, david, lewis, suggests, that, compatibilists, are, only, committed, to, the, ability, to, do, something, otherwise, if, different, circumstances, had, actually, obtained, in, the, past, using, t, f, for, true, and, false, and, for, undecided, there, are, exactly, nine, positions, regarding, determinism, free, will, that, consist, of, any, two, of, these, three, possibilities, incompatibilism, may, occupy, any, of, the, nine, positions, except, 5, 8, or, 3, which, last, corresponds, to, soft, determinism, position, 1, is, hard, determinism, and, position, 2, is, libertarianism, the, position, 1, of, hard, determinism, adds, to, the, table, the, contention, that, d, implies, fw, is, untrue, and, the, position, 2, of, libertarianism, adds, the, contention, that, fw, implies, d, is, untrue, position, 9, may, be, called, hard, incompatibilism, if, one, interprets, as, meaning, both, concepts, are, of, dubious, value, compatibilism, itself, may, occupy, any, of, the, nine, positions, that, is, there, is, no, logical, contradiction, between, determinism, and, free, will, and, either, or, both, may, be, true, or, false, in, principle, however, the, most, common, meaning, attached, to, compatibilism, is, that, some, form, of, determinism, is, true, and, yet, we, have, some, form, of, free, will, position, 3, alex, rosenberg, makes, an, extrapolation, of, physical, determinism, as, inferred, on, the, macroscopic, scale, by, the, behaviour, of, a, set, of, dominoes, to, neural, activity, in, the, brain, where, if, the, brain, is, nothing, but, a, complex, physical, object, whose, states, are, as, much, governed, by, physical, laws, as, any, other, physical, object, then, what, goes, on, in, our, heads, is, as, fixed, and, determined, by, prior, events, as, what, goes, on, when, one, domino, topples, another, in, a, long, row, of, them, physical, determinism, is, currently, disputed, by, prominent, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, and, while, not, necessarily, representative, of, intrinsic, indeterminism, in, nature, fundamental, limits, of, precision, in, measurement, are, inherent, in, the, uncertainty, principle, the, relevance, of, such, prospective, indeterminate, activity, to, free, will, is, however, contested, even, when, chaos, theory, is, introduced, to, magnify, the, effects, of, such, microscopic, events, below, these, positions, are, examined, in, more, detail, determinism, can, be, divided, into, causal, logical, and, theological, determinism, corresponding, to, each, of, these, different, meanings, there, arises, a, different, problem, for, free, will, hard, determinism, is, the, claim, that, determinism, is, true, and, that, it, is, incompatible, with, free, will, so, free, will, does, not, exist, although, hard, determinism, generally, refers, to, nomological, determinism, see, causal, determinism, below, it, can, include, all, forms, of, determinism, that, necessitate, the, future, in, its, entirety, relevant, forms, of, determinism, include, other, forms, of, determinism, are, more, relevant, to, compatibilism, such, as, biological, determinism, the, idea, that, all, behaviors, beliefs, and, desires, are, fixed, by, our, genetic, endowment, and, our, biochemical, makeup, the, latter, of, which, is, affected, by, both, genes, and, environment, cultural, determinism, and, psychological, determinism, combinations, and, syntheses, of, determinist, theses, such, as, bio, environmental, determinism, are, even, more, common, suggestions, have, been, made, that, hard, determinism, need, not, maintain, strict, determinism, where, something, near, to, like, that, informally, known, as, adequate, determinism, is, perhaps, more, relevant, despite, this, hard, determinism, has, grown, less, popular, in, present, times, given, scientific, suggestions, that, determinism, is, false, yet, the, intention, of, their, position, is, sustained, by, hard, incompatibilism, one, kind, of, incompatibilism, metaphysical, libertarianism, holds, onto, a, concept, of, free, will, that, requires, that, the, agent, be, able, to, take, more, than, one, possible, course, of, action, under, a, given, set, of, circumstances, accounts, of, libertarianism, subdivide, into, non, physical, theories, and, physical, or, naturalistic, theories, non, physical, theories, hold, that, the, events, in, the, brain, that, lead, to, the, performance, of, actions, do, not, have, an, entirely, physical, explanation, which, requires, that, the, world, is, not, closed, under, physics, this, includes, interactionist, dualism, which, claims, that, some, non, physical, mind, will, or, soul, overrides, physical, causality, physical, determinism, implies, there, is, only, one, possible, future, and, is, therefore, not, compatible, with, libertarian, free, will, as, consequent, of, incompatibilism, metaphysical, libertarian, explanations, that, do, not, involve, dispensing, with, physicalism, require, physical, indeterminism, such, as, probabilistic, subatomic, particle, behavior, theory, unknown, to, many, of, the, early, writers, on, free, will, incompatibilist, theories, can, be, categorised, based, on, the, type, of, indeterminism, they, require, uncaused, events, non, deterministically, caused, events, and, agent, substance, caused, events, non, causal, accounts, of, incompatibilist, free, will, do, not, require, a, free, action, to, be, caused, by, either, an, agent, or, a, physical, event, they, either, rely, upon, a, world, that, is, not, causally, closed, or, physical, indeterminism, non, causal, accounts, often, claim, that, each, intentional, action, requires, a, choice, or, volition, a, willing, trying, or, endeavoring, on, behalf, of, the, agent, such, as, the, cognitive, component, of, lifting, one, s, arm, such, intentional, actions, are, interpreted, as, free, actions, it, has, been, suggested, however, that, such, acting, cannot, be, said, to, exercise, control, over, anything, in, particular, according, to, non, causal, accounts, the, causation, by, the, agent, cannot, be, analysed, in, terms, of, causation, by, mental, states, or, events, including, desire, belief, intention, of, something, in, particular, but, rather, is, considered, a, matter, of, spontaneity, and, creativity, the, exercise, of, intent, in, such, intentional, actions, is, not, that, which, determines, their, freedom, intentional, actions, are, rather, self, generating, the, actish, feel, of, some, intentional, actions, do, not, constitute, that, event, s, activeness, or, the, agent, s, exercise, of, active, control, rather, they, might, be, brought, about, by, direct, stimulation, of, someone, s, brain, in, the, absence, of, any, relevant, desire, or, intention, on, the, part, of, that, person, another, question, raised, by, such, non, causal, theory, is, how, an, agent, acts, upon, reason, if, the, said, intentional, actions, are, spontaneous, some, non, causal, explanations, involve, invoking, panpsychism, the, theory, that, a, quality, of, mind, is, associated, with, all, particles, and, pervades, the, entire, universe, in, both, animate, and, inanimate, entities, event, causal, accounts, of, incompatibilist, free, will, typically, rely, upon, physicalist, models, of, mind, like, those, of, the, compatibilist, yet, they, presuppose, physical, indeterminism, in, which, certain, indeterministic, events, are, said, to, be, caused, by, the, agent, a, number, of, event, causal, accounts, of, free, will, have, been, created, referenced, here, as, deliberative, indeterminism, centred, accounts, and, efforts, of, will, theory, the, first, two, accounts, do, not, require, free, will, to, be, a, fundamental, constituent, of, the, universe, ordinary, randomness, is, appealed, to, as, supplying, the, elbow, room, that, libertarians, believe, necessary, a, first, common, objection, to, event, causal, accounts, is, that, the, indeterminism, could, be, destructive, and, could, therefore, diminish, control, by, the, agent, rather, than, provide, it, related, to, the, problem, of, origination, a, second, common, objection, to, these, models, is, that, it, is, questionable, whether, such, indeterminism, could, add, any, value, to, deliberation, over, that, which, is, already, present, in, a, deterministic, world, deliberative, indeterminism, asserts, that, the, indeterminism, is, confined, to, an, earlier, stage, in, the, decision, process, this, is, intended, to, provide, an, indeterminate, set, of, possibilities, to, choose, from, while, not, risking, the, introduction, of, luck, random, decision, making, the, selection, process, is, deterministic, although, it, may, be, based, on, earlier, preferences, established, by, the, same, process, deliberative, indeterminism, has, been, referenced, by, daniel, dennett, and, john, martin, fischer, an, obvious, objection, to, such, a, view, is, that, an, agent, cannot, be, assigned, ownership, over, their, decisions, or, preferences, used, to, make, those, decisions, to, any, greater, degree, than, that, of, a, compatibilist, model, centred, accounts, propose, that, for, any, given, decision, between, two, possibilities, the, strength, of, reason, will, be, considered, for, each, option, yet, there, is, still, a, probability, the, weaker, candidate, will, be, chosen, an, obvious, objection, to, such, a, view, is, that, decisions, are, explicitly, left, up, to, chance, and, origination, or, responsibility, cannot, be, assigned, for, any, given, decision, efforts, of, will, theory, is, related, to, the, role, of, will, power, in, decision, making, it, suggests, that, the, indeterminacy, of, agent, volition, processes, could, map, to, the, indeterminacy, of, certain, physical, events, and, the, outcomes, of, these, events, could, therefore, be, considered, caused, by, the, agent, models, of, volition, have, been, constructed, in, which, it, is, seen, as, a, particular, kind, of, complex, high, level, process, with, an, element, of, physical, indeterminism, an, example, of, this, approach, is, that, of, robert, kane, where, he, hypothesizes, that, in, each, case, the, indeterminism, is, functioning, as, a, hindrance, or, obstacle, to, her, realizing, one, of, her, purposes, a, hindrance, or, obstacle, in, the, form, of, resistance, within, her, will, which, must, be, overcome, by, effort, according, to, robert, kane, such, ultimate, responsibility, is, a, required, condition, for, free, will, an, important, factor, in, such, a, theory, is, that, the, agent, cannot, be, reduced, to, physical, neuronal, events, but, rather, mental, processes, are, said, to, provide, an, equally, valid, account, of, the, determination, of, outcome, as, their, physical, processes, see, non, reductive, physicalism, although, at, the, time, quantum, mechanics, and, physical, indeterminism, was, only, in, the, initial, stages, of, acceptance, in, his, book, miracles, a, preliminary, study, c, s, lewis, stated, the, logical, possibility, that, if, the, physical, world, were, proved, indeterministic, this, would, provide, an, entry, point, to, describe, an, action, of, a, non, physical, entity, on, physical, reality, indeterministic, physical, models, particularly, those, involving, quantum, indeterminacy, introduce, random, occurrences, at, an, atomic, or, subatomic, level, these, events, might, affect, brain, activity, and, could, seemingly, allow, incompatibilist, free, will, if, the, apparent, indeterminacy, of, some, mental, processes, for, instance, subjective, perceptions, of, control, in, conscious, volition, map, to, the, underlying, indeterminacy, of, the, physical, construct, this, relationship, however, requires, a, causative, role, over, probabilities, that, is, questionable, and, it, is, far, from, established, that, brain, activity, responsible, for, human, action, can, be, affected, by, such, events, secondarily, these, incompatibilist, models, are, dependent, upon, the, relationship, between, action, and, conscious, volition, as, studied, in, the, neuroscience, of, free, will, it, is, evident, that, observation, may, disturb, the, outcome, of, the, observation, itself, rendering, limited, our, ability, to, identify, causality, niels, bohr, one, of, the, main, architects, of, quantum, theory, suggested, however, that, no, connection, could, be, made, between, indeterminism, of, nature, and, freedom, of, will, agent, substance, causal, accounts, of, incompatibilist, free, will, rely, upon, substance, dualism, in, their, description, of, mind, the, agent, is, assumed, power, to, intervene, in, the, physical, world, agent, substance, causal, accounts, have, been, suggested, by, both, george, berkeley, and, thomas, reid, it, is, required, that, what, the, agent, causes, is, not, causally, determined, by, prior, events, it, is, also, required, that, the, agent, s, causing, of, that, event, is, not, causally, determined, by, prior, events, a, number, of, problems, have, been, identified, with, this, view, firstly, it, is, difficult, to, establish, the, reason, for, any, given, choice, by, the, agent, which, suggests, they, may, be, random, or, determined, by, luck, without, an, underlying, basis, for, the, free, will, decision, secondly, it, has, been, questioned, whether, physical, events, can, be, caused, by, an, external, substance, or, mind, a, common, problem, associated, with, interactionalist, dualism, hard, incompatibilism, is, the, idea, that, free, will, cannot, exist, whether, the, world, is, deterministic, or, not, derk, pereboom, has, defended, hard, incompatibilism, identifying, a, variety, of, positions, where, free, will, is, irrelevant, to, indeterminism, determinism, among, them, the, following, pereboom, calls, positions, 3, and, 4, soft, determinism, position, 1, a, form, of, hard, determinism, position, 6, a, form, of, classical, libertarianism, and, any, position, that, includes, having, f, as, compatibilism, john, locke, denied, that, the, phrase, free, will, made, any, sense, compare, with, theological, noncognitivism, a, similar, stance, on, the, existence, of, god, he, also, took, the, view, that, the, truth, of, determinism, was, irrelevant, he, believed, that, the, defining, feature, of, voluntary, behavior, was, that, individuals, have, the, ability, to, postpone, a, decision, long, enough, to, reflect, or, deliberate, upon, the, consequences, of, a, choice, the, will, in, truth, signifies, nothing, but, a, power, or, ability, to, prefer, or, choose, the, contemporary, philosopher, galen, strawson, agrees, with, locke, that, the, truth, or, falsity, of, determinism, is, irrelevant, to, the, problem, he, argues, that, the, notion, of, free, will, leads, to, an, infinite, regress, and, is, therefore, senseless, according, to, strawson, if, one, is, responsible, for, what, one, does, in, a, given, situation, then, one, must, be, responsible, for, the, way, one, is, in, certain, mental, respects, but, it, is, impossible, for, one, to, be, responsible, for, the, way, one, is, in, any, respect, this, is, because, to, be, responsible, in, some, situation, s, one, must, have, been, responsible, for, the, way, one, was, at, s, 1, to, be, responsible, for, the, way, one, was, at, s, 1, one, must, have, been, responsible, for, the, way, one, was, at, s, 2, and, so, on, at, some, point, in, the, chain, there, must, have, been, an, act, of, origination, of, a, new, causal, chain, but, this, is, impossible, man, cannot, create, himself, or, his, mental, states, ex, nihilo, this, argument, entails, that, free, will, itself, is, absurd, but, not, that, it, is, incompatible, with, determinism, strawson, calls, his, own, view, pessimism, but, it, can, be, classified, as, hard, incompatibilism, causal, determinism, is, the, concept, that, events, within, a, given, paradigm, are, bound, by, causality, in, such, a, way, that, any, state, of, an, object, or, event, is, completely, determined, by, prior, states, causal, determinism, proposes, that, there, is, an, unbroken, chain, of, prior, occurrences, stretching, back, to, the, origin, of, the, universe, causal, determinists, believe, that, there, is, nothing, uncaused, or, self, caused, the, most, common, form, of, causal, determinism, is, nomological, determinism, or, scientific, determinism, the, notion, that, the, past, and, the, present, dictate, the, future, entirely, and, necessarily, by, rigid, natural, laws, that, every, occurrence, results, inevitably, from, prior, events, quantum, mechanics, poses, a, serious, challenge, to, this, view, fundamental, debate, continues, over, whether, the, physical, universe, is, likely, to, be, deterministic, although, the, scientific, method, cannot, be, used, to, rule, out, indeterminism, with, respect, to, violations, of, causal, closure, it, can, be, used, to, identify, indeterminism, in, natural, law, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, at, present, are, both, deterministic, and, indeterministic, and, are, being, constrained, by, ongoing, experimentation, destiny, or, fate, is, a, predetermined, course, of, events, it, may, be, conceived, as, a, predetermined, future, whether, in, general, or, of, an, individual, it, is, a, concept, based, on, the, belief, that, there, is, a, fixed, natural, order, to, the, cosmos, although, often, used, interchangeably, the, words, fate, and, destiny, have, distinct, connotations, fate, generally, implies, there, is, a, set, course, that, cannot, be, deviated, from, and, over, which, one, has, no, control, fate, is, related, to, determinism, but, makes, no, specific, claim, of, physical, determinism, even, with, physical, indeterminism, an, event, could, still, be, fated, externally, see, for, instance, theological, determinism, destiny, likewise, is, related, to, determinism, but, makes, no, specific, claim, of, physical, determinism, even, with, physical, indeterminism, an, event, could, still, be, destined, to, occur, destiny, implies, there, is, a, set, course, that, cannot, be, deviated, from, but, does, not, of, itself, make, any, claim, with, respect, to, the, setting, of, that, course, i, e, it, does, not, necessarily, conflict, with, incompatibilist, free, will, free, will, if, existent, could, be, the, mechanism, by, which, that, destined, outcome, is, chosen, determined, to, represent, destiny, discussion, regarding, destiny, does, not, necessitate, the, existence, of, supernatural, powers, logical, determinism, or, determinateness, is, the, notion, that, all, propositions, whether, about, the, past, present, or, future, are, either, true, or, false, this, creates, a, unique, problem, for, free, will, given, that, propositions, about, the, future, already, have, a, truth, value, in, the, present, that, is, it, is, already, determined, as, either, true, or, false, and, is, referred, to, as, the, problem, of, future, contingents, omniscience, is, the, capacity, to, know, everything, that, there, is, to, know, included, in, which, are, all, future, events, and, is, a, property, often, attributed, to, a, creator, deity, omniscience, implies, the, existence, of, destiny, some, authors, have, claimed, that, free, will, cannot, coexist, with, omniscience, one, argument, asserts, that, an, omniscient, creator, not, only, implies, destiny, but, a, form, of, high, level, predeterminism, such, as, hard, theological, determinism, or, predestination, that, they, have, independently, fixed, all, events, and, outcomes, in, the, universe, in, advance, in, such, a, case, even, if, an, individual, could, have, influence, over, their, lower, level, physical, system, their, choices, in, regard, to, this, cannot, be, their, own, as, is, the, case, with, libertarian, free, will, omniscience, features, as, an, incompatible, properties, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, known, as, the, argument, from, free, will, and, is, closely, related, to, other, such, arguments, for, example, the, incompatibility, of, omnipotence, with, a, good, creator, deity, i, e, if, a, deity, knew, what, they, were, going, to, choose, then, they, are, responsible, for, letting, them, choose, it, predeterminism, is, the, idea, that, all, events, are, determined, in, advance, predeterminism, is, the, philosophy, that, all, events, of, history, past, present, and, future, have, been, decided, or, are, known, by, god, fate, or, some, other, force, including, human, actions, predeterminism, is, frequently, taken, to, mean, that, human, actions, cannot, interfere, with, or, have, no, bearing, on, the, outcomes, of, a, pre, determined, course, of, events, and, that, one, s, destiny, was, established, externally, for, example, exclusively, by, a, creator, deity, the, concept, of, predeterminism, is, often, argued, by, invoking, causal, determinism, implying, that, there, is, an, unbroken, chain, of, prior, occurrences, stretching, back, to, the, origin, of, the, universe, in, the, case, of, predeterminism, this, chain, of, events, has, been, pre, established, and, human, actions, cannot, interfere, with, the, outcomes, of, this, pre, established, chain, predeterminism, can, be, used, to, mean, such, pre, established, causal, determinism, in, which, case, it, is, categorised, as, a, specific, type, of, determinism, it, can, also, be, used, interchangeably, with, causal, determinism, in, the, context, of, its, capacity, to, determine, future, events, despite, this, predeterminism, is, often, considered, as, independent, of, causal, determinism, the, term, predeterminism, is, also, frequently, used, in, the, context, of, biology, and, heredity, in, which, case, it, represents, a, form, of, biological, determinism, the, term, predeterminism, suggests, not, just, a, determining, of, all, events, but, the, prior, and, deliberately, conscious, determining, of, all, events, therefore, done, presumably, by, a, conscious, being, while, determinism, usually, refers, to, a, naturalistically, explainable, causality, of, events, predeterminism, seems, by, definition, to, suggest, a, person, or, a, someone, who, is, controlling, or, planning, the, causality, of, events, before, they, occur, and, who, then, perhaps, resides, beyond, the, natural, causal, universe, predestination, asserts, that, a, supremely, powerful, being, has, indeed, fixed, all, events, and, outcomes, in, the, universe, in, advance, and, is, a, famous, doctrine, of, the, calvinists, in, christian, theology, predestination, is, often, considered, a, form, of, hard, theological, determinism, predeterminism, has, therefore, been, compared, to, fatalism, fatalism, is, the, idea, that, everything, is, fated, to, happen, so, that, humans, have, no, control, over, their, future, theological, determinism, is, a, form, of, determinism, stating, that, all, events, that, happen, are, pre, ordained, or, predestined, to, happen, by, a, monotheistic, deity, or, that, they, are, destined, to, occur, given, its, omniscience, two, forms, of, theological, determinism, exist, here, referenced, as, strong, and, weak, theological, determinism, there, exist, slight, variations, on, the, above, categorisation, some, claim, that, theological, determinism, requires, predestination, of, all, events, and, outcomes, by, the, divinity, that, is, they, do, not, classify, the, weaker, version, as, theological, determinism, unless, libertarian, free, will, is, assumed, to, be, denied, as, a, consequence, or, that, the, weaker, version, does, not, constitute, theological, determinism, at, all, theological, determinism, can, also, be, seen, as, a, form, of, causal, determinism, in, which, the, antecedent, conditions, are, the, nature, and, will, of, god, with, respect, to, free, will, and, the, classification, of, theological, compatibilism, incompatibilism, below, theological, determinism, is, the, thesis, that, god, exists, and, has, infallible, knowledge, of, all, true, propositions, including, propositions, about, our, future, actions, more, minimal, criteria, designed, to, encapsulate, all, forms, of, theological, determinism, there, are, various, implications, for, metaphysical, libertarian, free, will, as, consequent, of, theological, determinism, and, its, philosophical, interpretation, the, basic, argument, for, theological, fatalism, in, the, case, of, weak, theological, determinism, is, as, follows, this, argument, is, very, often, accepted, as, a, basis, for, theological, incompatibilism, denying, either, libertarian, free, will, or, divine, foreknowledge, omniscience, and, therefore, theological, determinism, on, the, other, hand, theological, compatibilism, must, attempt, to, find, problems, with, it, the, formal, version, of, the, argument, rests, on, a, number, of, premises, many, of, which, have, received, some, degree, of, contention, theological, compatibilist, responses, have, included, in, the, definition, of, compatibilism, and, incompatibilism, the, literature, often, fails, to, distinguish, between, physical, determinism, and, higher, level, forms, of, determinism, predeterminism, theological, determinism, etc, as, such, hard, determinism, with, respect, to, theological, determinism, or, hard, theological, determinism, above, might, be, classified, as, hard, incompatibilism, with, respect, to, physical, determinism, if, no, claim, was, made, regarding, the, internal, causality, or, determinism, of, the, universe, or, even, compatibilism, if, freedom, from, the, constraint, of, determinism, was, not, considered, necessary, for, free, will, if, not, hard, determinism, itself, by, the, same, principle, metaphysical, libertarianism, a, form, of, incompatibilism, with, respect, to, physical, determinism, might, be, classified, as, compatibilism, with, respect, to, theological, determinism, if, it, was, assumed, such, free, will, events, were, pre, ordained, and, therefore, were, destined, to, occur, but, of, which, whose, outcomes, were, not, predestined, or, determined, by, god, if, hard, theological, determinism, is, accepted, if, it, was, assumed, instead, that, such, outcomes, were, predestined, by, god, then, metaphysical, libertarianism, is, not, however, possible, and, would, require, reclassification, as, hard, incompatibilism, for, example, given, that, the, universe, is, still, assumed, to, be, indeterministic, although, the, classification, of, hard, determinism, is, technically, valid, also, the, idea, of, free, will, is, one, aspect, of, the, mind, body, problem, that, is, consideration, of, the, relation, between, mind, for, example, consciousness, memory, and, judgment, and, body, for, example, the, human, brain, and, nervous, system, philosophical, models, of, mind, are, divided, into, physical, and, non, physical, expositions, cartesian, dualism, holds, that, the, mind, is, a, nonphysical, substance, the, seat, of, consciousness, and, intelligence, and, is, not, identical, with, physical, states, of, the, brain, or, body, it, is, suggested, that, although, the, two, worlds, do, interact, each, retains, some, measure, of, autonomy, under, cartesian, dualism, external, mind, is, responsible, for, bodily, action, although, unconscious, brain, activity, is, often, caused, by, external, events, for, example, the, instantaneous, reaction, to, being, burned, cartesian, dualism, implies, that, the, physical, world, is, not, deterministic, and, in, which, external, mind, controls, at, least, some, physical, events, providing, an, interpretation, of, incompatibilist, free, will, stemming, from, cartesian, dualism, a, formulation, sometimes, called, interactionalist, dualism, suggests, a, two, way, interaction, that, some, physical, events, cause, some, mental, acts, and, some, mental, acts, cause, some, physical, events, one, modern, vision, of, the, possible, separation, of, mind, and, body, is, the, three, world, formulation, of, popper, cartesian, dualism, and, popper, s, three, worlds, are, two, forms, of, what, is, called, epistemological, pluralism, that, is, the, notion, that, different, epistemological, methodologies, are, necessary, to, attain, a, full, description, of, the, world, other, forms, of, epistemological, pluralist, dualism, include, psychophysical, parallelism, and, epiphenomenalism, epistemological, pluralism, is, one, view, in, which, the, mind, body, problem, is, not, reducible, to, the, concepts, of, the, natural, sciences, a, contrasting, approach, is, called, physicalism, physicalism, is, a, philosophical, theory, holding, that, everything, that, exists, is, no, more, extensive, than, its, physical, properties, that, is, that, there, are, no, non, physical, substances, for, example, physically, independent, minds, physicalism, can, be, reductive, or, non, reductive, reductive, physicalism, is, grounded, in, the, idea, that, everything, in, the, world, can, actually, be, reduced, analytically, to, its, fundamental, physical, or, material, basis, alternatively, non, reductive, physicalism, asserts, that, mental, properties, form, a, separate, ontological, class, to, physical, properties, that, mental, states, such, as, qualia, are, not, ontologically, reducible, to, physical, states, although, one, might, suppose, that, mental, states, and, neurological, states, are, different, in, kind, that, does, not, rule, out, the, possibility, that, mental, states, are, correlated, with, neurological, states, in, one, such, construction, anomalous, monism, mental, events, supervene, on, physical, events, describing, the, emergence, of, mental, properties, correlated, with, physical, properties, implying, causal, reducibility, non, reductive, physicalism, is, therefore, often, categorised, as, property, dualism, rather, than, monism, yet, other, types, of, property, dualism, do, not, adhere, to, the, causal, reducibility, of, mental, states, see, epiphenomenalism, incompatibilism, requires, a, distinction, between, the, mental, and, the, physical, being, a, commentary, on, the, incompatibility, of, determined, physical, reality, and, one, s, presumably, distinct, experience, of, will, secondarily, metaphysical, libertarian, free, will, must, assert, influence, on, physical, reality, and, where, mind, is, responsible, for, such, influence, as, opposed, to, ordinary, system, randomness, it, must, be, distinct, from, body, to, accomplish, this, both, substance, and, property, dualism, offer, such, a, distinction, and, those, particular, models, thereof, that, are, not, causally, inert, with, respect, to, the, physical, world, provide, a, basis, for, illustrating, incompatibilist, free, will, i, e, interactionalist, dualism, and, non, reductive, physicalism, it, has, been, noted, that, the, laws, of, physics, have, yet, to, resolve, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, solving, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, involves, determining, how, physiological, processes, such, as, ions, flowing, across, the, nerve, membrane, cause, us, to, have, experiences, according, to, some, intricately, related, to, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, the, hard, problem, of, free, will, represents, the, core, problem, of, conscious, free, will, does, conscious, volition, impact, the, material, world, others, however, argue, that, consciousness, plays, a, far, smaller, role, in, human, life, than, western, culture, has, tended, to, believe, compatibilists, maintain, that, determinism, is, compatible, with, free, will, they, believe, freedom, can, be, present, or, absent, in, a, situation, for, reasons, that, have, nothing, to, do, with, metaphysics, for, instance, courts, of, law, make, judgments, about, whether, individuals, are, acting, under, their, own, free, will, under, certain, circumstances, without, bringing, in, metaphysics, similarly, political, liberty, is, a, non, metaphysical, concept, likewise, some, compatibilists, define, free, will, as, freedom, to, act, according, to, one, s, determined, motives, without, hindrance, from, other, individuals, so, for, example, aristotle, in, his, nicomachean, ethics, and, the, stoic, chrysippus, in, contrast, the, incompatibilist, positions, are, concerned, with, a, sort, of, metaphysically, free, will, which, compatibilists, claim, has, never, been, coherently, defined, compatibilists, argue, that, determinism, does, not, matter, though, they, disagree, among, themselves, about, what, in, turn, does, matter, to, be, a, compatibilist, one, need, not, endorse, any, particular, conception, of, free, will, but, only, deny, that, determinism, is, at, odds, with, free, will, although, there, are, various, impediments, to, exercising, one, s, choices, free, will, does, not, imply, freedom, of, action, freedom, of, choice, freedom, to, select, one, s, will, is, logically, separate, from, freedom, to, implement, that, choice, freedom, to, enact, one, s, will, although, not, all, writers, observe, this, distinction, nonetheless, some, philosophers, have, defined, free, will, as, the, absence, of, various, impediments, some, modern, compatibilists, such, as, harry, frankfurt, and, daniel, dennett, argue, free, will, is, simply, freely, choosing, to, do, what, constraints, allow, one, to, do, in, other, words, a, coerced, agent, s, choices, can, still, be, free, if, such, coercion, coincides, with, the, agent, s, personal, intentions, and, desires, most, classical, compatibilists, such, as, thomas, hobbes, claim, that, a, person, is, acting, on, the, person, s, own, will, only, when, it, is, the, desire, of, that, person, to, do, the, act, and, also, possible, for, the, person, to, be, able, to, do, otherwise, if, the, person, had, decided, to, hobbes, sometimes, attributes, such, compatibilist, freedom, to, each, individual, and, not, to, some, abstract, notion, of, will, asserting, for, example, that, no, liberty, can, be, inferred, to, the, will, desire, or, inclination, but, the, liberty, of, the, man, which, consisteth, in, this, that, he, finds, no, stop, in, doing, what, he, has, the, will, desire, or, inclination, to, doe, in, articulating, this, crucial, proviso, david, hume, writes, this, hypothetical, liberty, is, universally, allowed, to, belong, to, every, one, who, is, not, a, prisoner, and, in, chains, similarly, voltaire, in, his, dictionnaire, philosophique, claimed, that, liberty, then, is, only, and, can, be, only, the, power, to, do, what, one, will, he, asked, would, you, have, everything, at, the, pleasure, of, a, million, blind, caprices, for, him, free, will, or, liberty, is, only, the, power, of, acting, what, is, this, power, it, is, the, effect, of, the, constitution, and, present, state, of, our, organs, compatibilism, often, regards, the, agent, free, as, virtue, of, their, reason, some, explanations, of, free, will, focus, on, the, internal, causality, of, the, mind, with, respect, to, higher, order, brain, processing, the, interaction, between, conscious, and, unconscious, brain, activity, likewise, some, modern, compatibilists, in, psychology, have, tried, to, revive, traditionally, accepted, struggles, of, free, will, with, the, formation, of, character, compatibilist, free, will, has, also, been, attributed, to, our, natural, sense, of, agency, where, one, must, believe, they, are, an, agent, in, order, to, function, and, develop, a, theory, of, mind, the, notion, of, levels, of, decision, is, presented, in, a, different, manner, by, frankfurt, frankfurt, argues, for, a, version, of, compatibilism, called, the, hierarchical, mesh, the, idea, is, that, an, individual, can, have, conflicting, desires, at, a, first, order, level, and, also, have, a, desire, about, the, various, first, order, desires, a, second, order, desire, to, the, effect, that, one, of, the, desires, prevails, over, the, others, a, person, s, will, is, identified, with, their, effective, first, order, desire, that, is, the, one, they, act, on, and, this, will, is, free, if, it, was, the, desire, the, person, wanted, to, act, upon, that, is, the, person, s, second, order, desire, was, effective, so, for, example, there, are, wanton, addicts, unwilling, addicts, and, willing, addicts, all, three, groups, may, have, the, conflicting, first, order, desires, to, want, to, take, the, drug, they, are, addicted, to, and, to, not, want, to, take, it, the, first, group, wanton, addicts, have, no, second, order, desire, not, to, take, the, drug, the, second, group, unwilling, addicts, have, a, second, order, desire, not, to, take, the, drug, while, the, third, group, willing, addicts, have, a, second, order, desire, to, take, it, according, to, frankfurt, the, members, of, the, first, group, are, devoid, of, will, and, therefore, are, no, longer, persons, the, members, of, the, second, group, freely, desire, not, to, take, the, drug, but, their, will, is, overcome, by, the, addiction, finally, the, members, of, the, third, group, willingly, take, the, drug, they, are, addicted, to, frankfurt, s, theory, can, ramify, to, any, number, of, levels, critics, of, the, theory, point, out, that, there, is, no, certainty, that, conflicts, will, not, arise, even, at, the, higher, order, levels, of, desire, and, preference, others, argue, that, frankfurt, offers, no, adequate, explanation, of, how, the, various, levels, in, the, hierarchy, mesh, together, in, elbow, room, dennett, presents, an, argument, for, a, compatibilist, theory, of, free, will, which, he, further, elaborated, in, the, book, freedom, evolves, the, basic, reasoning, is, that, if, one, excludes, god, an, infinitely, powerful, demon, and, other, such, possibilities, then, because, of, chaos, and, epistemic, limits, on, the, precision, of, our, knowledge, of, the, current, state, of, the, world, the, future, is, ill, defined, for, all, finite, beings, the, only, well, defined, things, are, expectations, the, ability, to, do, otherwise, only, makes, sense, when, dealing, with, these, expectations, and, not, with, some, unknown, and, unknowable, future, according, to, dennett, because, individuals, have, the, ability, to, act, differently, from, what, anyone, expects, free, will, can, exist, incompatibilists, claim, the, problem, with, this, idea, is, that, we, may, be, mere, automata, responding, in, predictable, ways, to, stimuli, in, our, environment, therefore, all, of, our, actions, are, controlled, by, forces, outside, ourselves, or, by, random, chance, more, sophisticated, analyses, of, compatibilist, free, will, have, been, offered, as, have, other, critiques, in, the, philosophy, of, decision, theory, a, fundamental, question, is, from, the, standpoint, of, statistical, outcomes, to, what, extent, do, the, choices, of, a, conscious, being, have, the, ability, to, influence, the, future, newcomb, s, paradox, and, other, philosophical, problems, pose, questions, about, free, will, and, predictable, outcomes, of, choices, compatibilist, models, of, free, will, often, consider, deterministic, relationships, as, discoverable, in, the, physical, world, including, the, brain, cognitive, naturalism, is, a, physicalist, approach, to, studying, human, cognition, and, consciousness, in, which, the, mind, is, simply, part, of, nature, perhaps, merely, a, feature, of, many, very, complex, self, programming, feedback, systems, for, example, neural, networks, and, cognitive, robots, and, so, must, be, studied, by, the, methods, of, empirical, science, such, as, the, behavioral, and, cognitive, sciences, i, e, neuroscience, and, cognitive, psychology, cognitive, naturalism, stresses, the, role, of, neurological, sciences, overall, brain, health, substance, dependence, depression, and, various, personality, disorders, clearly, influence, mental, activity, and, their, impact, upon, volition, is, also, important, for, example, an, addict, may, experience, a, conscious, desire, to, escape, addiction, but, be, unable, to, do, so, the, will, is, disconnected, from, the, freedom, to, act, this, situation, is, related, to, an, abnormal, production, and, distribution, of, dopamine, in, the, brain, the, neuroscience, of, free, will, places, restrictions, on, both, compatibilist, and, incompatibilist, free, will, conceptions, compatibilist, models, adhere, to, models, of, mind, in, which, mental, activity, such, as, deliberation, can, be, reduced, to, physical, activity, without, any, change, in, physical, outcome, although, compatibilism, is, generally, aligned, to, or, is, at, least, compatible, with, physicalism, some, compatibilist, models, describe, the, natural, occurrences, of, deterministic, deliberation, in, the, brain, in, terms, of, the, first, person, perspective, of, the, conscious, agent, performing, the, deliberation, such, an, approach, has, been, considered, a, form, of, identity, dualism, a, description, of, how, conscious, experience, might, affect, brains, has, been, provided, in, which, the, experience, of, conscious, free, will, is, the, first, person, perspective, of, the, neural, correlates, of, choosing, recently, claudio, costa, developed, a, neocompatibilist, theory, based, on, the, causal, theory, of, action, that, is, complementary, to, classical, compatibilism, according, to, him, physical, psychological, and, rational, restrictions, can, interfere, at, different, levels, of, the, causal, chain, that, would, naturally, lead, to, action, correspondingly, there, can, be, physical, restrictions, to, the, body, psychological, restrictions, to, the, decision, and, rational, restrictions, to, the, formation, of, reasons, desires, plus, beliefs, that, should, lead, to, what, we, would, call, a, reasonable, action, the, last, two, are, usually, called, restrictions, of, free, will, the, restriction, at, the, level, of, reasons, is, particularly, important, since, it, can, be, motivated, by, external, reasons, that, are, insufficiently, conscious, to, the, agent, one, example, was, the, collective, suicide, led, by, jim, jones, the, suicidal, agents, were, not, conscious, that, their, free, will, have, been, manipulated, by, external, even, if, ungrounded, reasons, alternatives, to, strictly, naturalist, physics, such, as, mind, body, dualism, positing, a, mind, or, soul, existing, apart, from, one, s, body, while, perceiving, thinking, choosing, freely, and, as, a, result, acting, independently, on, the, body, include, both, traditional, religious, metaphysics, and, less, common, newer, compatibilist, concepts, also, consistent, with, both, autonomy, and, darwinism, they, allow, for, free, personal, agency, based, on, practical, reasons, within, the, laws, of, physics, while, less, popular, among, 21st, century, philosophers, non, naturalist, compatibilism, is, present, in, most, if, not, almost, all, religions, some, philosophers, views, are, difficult, to, categorize, as, either, compatibilist, or, incompatibilist, hard, determinist, or, libertarian, for, example, ted, honderich, holds, the, view, that, determinism, is, true, compatibilism, and, incompatibilism, are, both, false, and, the, real, problem, lies, elsewhere, honderich, maintains, that, determinism, is, true, because, quantum, phenomena, are, not, events, or, things, that, can, be, located, in, space, and, time, but, are, abstract, entities, further, even, if, they, were, micro, level, events, they, do, not, seem, to, have, any, relevance, to, how, the, world, is, at, the, macroscopic, level, he, maintains, that, incompatibilism, is, false, because, even, if, indeterminism, is, true, incompatibilists, have, not, provided, and, cannot, provide, an, adequate, account, of, origination, he, rejects, compatibilism, because, it, like, incompatibilism, assumes, a, single, fundamental, notion, of, freedom, there, are, really, two, notions, of, freedom, voluntary, action, and, origination, both, notions, are, required, to, explain, freedom, of, will, and, responsibility, both, determinism, and, indeterminism, are, threats, to, such, freedom, to, abandon, these, notions, of, freedom, would, be, to, abandon, moral, responsibility, on, the, one, side, we, have, our, intuitions, on, the, other, the, scientific, facts, the, new, problem, is, how, to, resolve, this, conflict, david, hume, discussed, the, possibility, that, the, entire, debate, about, free, will, is, nothing, more, than, a, merely, verbal, issue, he, suggested, that, it, might, be, accounted, for, by, a, false, sensation, or, seeming, experience, a, velleity, which, is, associated, with, many, of, our, actions, when, we, perform, them, on, reflection, we, realize, that, they, were, necessary, and, determined, all, along, according, to, arthur, schopenhauer, the, actions, of, humans, as, phenomena, are, subject, to, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, and, thus, liable, to, necessity, thus, he, argues, humans, do, not, possess, free, will, as, conventionally, understood, however, the, will, as, the, noumenon, underlying, the, phenomenal, world, is, in, itself, groundless, that, is, not, subject, to, time, space, and, causality, the, forms, that, governs, the, world, of, appearance, thus, the, will, in, itself, and, outside, of, appearance, is, free, schopenhauer, discussed, the, puzzle, of, free, will, and, moral, responsibility, in, the, world, as, will, and, representation, book, 2, sec, 23, but, the, fact, is, overlooked, that, the, individual, the, person, is, not, will, as, thing, in, itself, but, is, phenomenon, of, the, will, is, as, such, determined, and, has, entered, the, form, of, the, phenomenon, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, hence, we, get, the, strange, fact, that, everyone, considers, himself, to, be, a, priori, quite, free, even, in, his, individual, actions, and, imagines, he, can, at, any, moment, enter, upon, a, different, way, of, life, but, a, posteriori, through, experience, he, finds, to, his, astonishment, that, he, is, not, free, but, liable, to, necessity, that, notwithstanding, all, his, resolutions, and, reflections, he, does, not, change, his, conduct, and, that, from, the, beginning, to, the, end, of, his, life, he, must, bear, the, same, character, that, he, himself, condemns, and, as, it, were, must, play, to, the, end, the, part, he, has, taken, upon, himself, schopenhauer, elaborated, on, the, topic, in, book, iv, of, the, same, work, and, in, even, greater, depth, in, his, later, essay, on, the, freedom, of, the, will, in, this, work, he, stated, you, can, do, what, you, will, but, in, any, given, moment, of, your, life, you, can, will, only, one, definite, thing, and, absolutely, nothing, other, than, that, one, thing, rudolf, steiner, who, collaborated, in, a, complete, edition, of, arthur, schopenhauer, s, work, wrote, the, philosophy, of, freedom, which, focuses, on, the, problem, of, free, will, steiner, 1861, 1925, initially, divides, this, into, the, two, aspects, of, freedom, freedom, of, thought, and, freedom, of, action, the, controllable, and, uncontrollable, aspects, of, decision, making, thereby, are, made, logically, separable, as, pointed, out, in, the, introduction, this, separation, of, will, from, action, has, a, very, long, history, going, back, at, least, as, far, as, stoicism, and, the, teachings, of, chrysippus, 279, 206, bce, who, separated, external, antecedent, causes, from, the, internal, disposition, receiving, this, cause, steiner, then, argues, that, inner, freedom, is, achieved, when, we, integrate, our, sensory, impressions, which, reflect, the, outer, appearance, of, the, world, with, our, thoughts, which, lend, coherence, to, these, impressions, and, thereby, disclose, to, us, an, understandable, world, acknowledging, the, many, influences, on, our, choices, he, nevertheless, points, out, that, they, do, not, preclude, freedom, unless, we, fail, to, recognise, them, steiner, argues, that, outer, freedom, is, attained, by, permeating, our, deeds, with, moral, imagination, moral, in, this, case, refers, to, action, that, is, willed, while, imagination, refers, to, the, mental, capacity, to, envision, conditions, that, do, not, already, hold, both, of, these, functions, are, necessarily, conditions, for, freedom, steiner, aims, to, show, that, these, two, aspects, of, inner, and, outer, freedom, are, integral, to, one, another, and, that, true, freedom, is, only, achieved, when, they, are, united, william, james, views, were, ambivalent, while, he, believed, in, free, will, on, ethical, grounds, he, did, not, believe, that, there, was, evidence, for, it, on, scientific, grounds, nor, did, his, own, introspections, support, it, ultimately, he, believed, that, the, problem, of, free, will, was, a, metaphysical, issue, and, therefore, could, not, be, settled, by, science, moreover, he, did, not, accept, incompatibilism, as, formulated, below, he, did, not, believe, that, the, indeterminism, of, human, actions, was, a, prerequisite, of, moral, responsibility, in, his, work, pragmatism, he, wrote, that, instinct, and, utility, between, them, can, safely, be, trusted, to, carry, on, the, social, business, of, punishment, and, praise, regardless, of, metaphysical, theories, he, did, believe, that, indeterminism, is, important, as, a, doctrine, of, relief, it, allows, for, the, view, that, although, the, world, may, be, in, many, respects, a, bad, place, it, may, through, individuals, actions, become, a, better, one, determinism, he, argued, undermines, meliorism, the, idea, that, progress, is, a, real, concept, leading, to, improvement, in, the, world, in, 1739, david, hume, in, his, a, treatise, of, human, nature, approached, free, will, via, the, notion, of, causality, it, was, his, position, that, causality, was, a, mental, construct, used, to, explain, the, repeated, association, of, events, and, that, one, must, examine, more, closely, the, relation, between, things, regularly, succeeding, one, another, descriptions, of, regularity, in, nature, and, things, that, result, in, other, things, things, that, cause, or, necessitate, other, things, according, to, hume, causation, is, on, weak, grounds, once, we, realise, that, a, must, bring, about, b, is, tantamount, merely, to, due, to, their, constant, conjunction, we, are, psychologically, certain, that, b, will, follow, a, then, we, are, left, with, a, very, weak, notion, of, necessity, this, empiricist, view, was, often, denied, by, trying, to, prove, the, so, called, apriority, of, causal, law, i, e, that, it, precedes, all, experience, and, is, rooted, in, the, construction, of, the, perceivable, world, in, the, 1780s, immanuel, kant, suggested, at, a, minimum, our, decision, processes, with, moral, implications, lie, outside, the, reach, of, everyday, causality, and, lie, outside, the, rules, governing, material, objects, there, is, a, sharp, difference, between, moral, judgments, and, judgments, of, fact, moral, judgments, must, be, a, priori, judgments, freeman, introduces, what, he, calls, circular, causality, to, allow, for, the, contribution, of, self, organizing, dynamics, the, formation, of, macroscopic, population, dynamics, that, shapes, the, patterns, of, activity, of, the, contributing, individuals, applicable, to, interactions, between, neurons, and, neural, masses, and, between, the, behaving, animal, and, its, environment, in, this, view, mind, and, neurological, functions, are, tightly, coupled, in, a, situation, where, feedback, between, collective, actions, mind, and, individual, subsystems, for, example, neurons, and, their, synapses, jointly, decide, upon, the, behaviour, of, both, thirteenth, century, philosopher, thomas, aquinas, viewed, humans, as, pre, programmed, by, virtue, of, being, human, to, seek, certain, goals, but, able, to, choose, between, routes, to, achieve, these, goals, our, aristotelian, telos, his, view, has, been, associated, with, both, compatibilism, and, libertarianism, in, facing, choices, he, argued, that, humans, are, governed, by, intellect, will, and, passions, the, will, is, the, primary, mover, of, all, the, powers, of, the, soul, and, it, is, also, the, efficient, cause, of, motion, in, the, body, choice, falls, into, five, stages, i, intellectual, consideration, of, whether, an, objective, is, desirable, ii, intellectual, consideration, of, means, of, attaining, the, objective, iii, will, arrives, at, an, intent, to, pursue, the, objective, iv, will, and, intellect, jointly, decide, upon, choice, of, means, v, will, elects, execution, free, will, enters, as, follows, free, will, is, an, appetitive, power, that, is, not, a, cognitive, power, of, intellect, the, term, appetite, from, aquinas, s, definition, includes, all, forms, of, internal, inclination, he, states, that, judgment, concludes, and, terminates, counsel, now, counsel, is, terminated, first, by, the, judgment, of, reason, secondly, by, the, acceptation, of, the, appetite, a, compatibilist, interpretation, of, aquinas, s, view, is, defended, thus, free, will, is, the, cause, of, its, own, movement, because, by, his, free, will, man, moves, himself, to, act, but, it, does, not, of, necessity, belong, to, liberty, that, what, is, free, should, be, the, first, cause, of, itself, as, neither, for, one, thing, to, be, cause, of, another, need, it, be, the, first, cause, god, therefore, is, the, first, cause, who, moves, causes, both, natural, and, voluntary, and, just, as, by, moving, natural, causes, he, does, not, prevent, their, acts, being, natural, so, by, moving, voluntary, causes, he, does, not, deprive, their, actions, of, being, voluntary, but, rather, is, he, the, cause, of, this, very, thing, in, them, for, he, operates, in, each, thing, according, to, its, own, nature, historically, most, of, the, philosophical, effort, invested, in, resolving, the, dilemma, has, taken, the, form, of, close, examination, of, definitions, and, ambiguities, in, the, concepts, designated, by, free, freedom, will, choice, and, so, forth, defining, free, will, often, revolves, around, the, meaning, of, phrases, like, ability, to, do, otherwise, or, alternative, possibilities, this, emphasis, upon, words, has, led, some, philosophers, to, claim, the, problem, is, merely, verbal, and, thus, a, pseudo, problem, in, response, others, point, out, the, complexity, of, decision, making, and, the, importance, of, nuances, in, the, terminology, buddhism, accepts, both, freedom, and, determinism, or, something, similar, to, it, but, despite, its, focus, on, human, agency, it, rejects, the, western, concept, of, a, total, agent, from, external, sources, according, to, the, buddha, there, is, free, action, there, is, retribution, but, i, see, no, agent, that, passes, out, from, one, set, of, momentary, elements, into, another, one, except, the, of, those, elements, buddhists, believe, in, neither, absolute, free, will, nor, determinism, it, preaches, a, middle, doctrine, named, prat, tyasamutp, da, in, sanskrit, often, translated, as, dependent, origination, dependent, arising, or, conditioned, genesis, it, teaches, that, every, volition, is, a, conditioned, action, as, a, result, of, ignorance, in, part, it, states, that, free, will, is, inherently, conditioned, and, not, free, to, begin, with, it, is, also, part, of, the, theory, of, karma, in, buddhism, the, concept, of, karma, in, buddhism, is, different, from, the, notion, of, karma, in, hinduism, in, buddhism, the, idea, of, karma, is, much, less, deterministic, the, buddhist, notion, of, karma, is, primarily, focused, on, the, cause, and, effect, of, moral, actions, in, this, life, while, in, hinduism, the, concept, of, karma, is, more, often, connected, with, determining, one, s, destiny, in, future, lives, in, buddhism, it, is, taught, that, the, idea, of, absolute, freedom, of, choice, that, is, that, any, human, being, could, be, completely, free, to, make, any, choice, is, unwise, because, it, denies, the, reality, of, one, s, physical, needs, and, circumstances, equally, incorrect, is, the, idea, that, humans, have, no, choice, in, life, or, that, their, lives, are, pre, determined, to, deny, freedom, would, be, to, deny, the, efforts, of, buddhists, to, make, moral, progress, through, our, capacity, to, freely, choose, compassionate, action, pubbekatahetuvada, the, belief, that, all, happiness, and, suffering, arise, from, previous, actions, is, considered, a, wrong, view, according, to, buddhist, doctrines, because, buddhists, also, reject, agenthood, the, traditional, compatibilist, strategies, are, closed, to, them, as, well, instead, the, buddhist, philosophical, strategy, is, to, examine, the, metaphysics, of, causality, ancient, india, had, many, heated, arguments, about, the, nature, of, causality, with, jains, nyayists, samkhyists, c, rv, kans, and, buddhists, all, taking, slightly, different, lines, in, many, ways, the, buddhist, position, is, closer, to, a, theory, of, conditionality, idappaccayat, than, a, theory, of, causality, especially, as, it, is, expounded, by, nagarjuna, in, the, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, the, six, orthodox, astika, schools, of, thought, in, hindu, philosophy, do, not, agree, with, each, other, entirely, on, the, question, of, free, will, for, the, samkhya, for, instance, matter, is, without, any, freedom, and, soul, lacks, any, ability, to, control, the, unfolding, of, matter, the, only, real, freedom, kaivalya, consists, in, realizing, the, ultimate, separateness, of, matter, and, self, for, the, yoga, school, only, ishvara, is, truly, free, and, its, freedom, is, also, distinct, from, all, feelings, thoughts, actions, or, wills, and, is, thus, not, at, all, a, freedom, of, will, the, metaphysics, of, the, nyaya, and, vaisheshika, schools, strongly, suggest, a, belief, in, determinism, but, do, not, seem, to, make, explicit, claims, about, determinism, or, free, will, a, quotation, from, swami, vivekananda, a, vedantist, offers, a, good, example, of, the, worry, about, free, will, in, the, hindu, tradition, therefore, we, see, at, once, that, there, cannot, be, any, such, thing, as, free, will, the, very, words, are, a, contradiction, because, will, is, what, we, know, and, everything, that, we, know, is, within, our, universe, and, everything, within, our, universe, is, moulded, by, conditions, of, time, space, and, causality, to, acquire, freedom, we, have, to, get, beyond, the, limitations, of, this, universe, it, cannot, be, found, here, however, the, preceding, quote, has, often, been, misinterpreted, as, vivekananda, implying, that, everything, is, predetermined, what, vivekananda, actually, meant, by, lack, of, free, will, was, that, the, will, was, not, free, because, it, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, law, of, cause, and, effect, the, will, is, not, free, it, is, a, phenomenon, bound, by, cause, and, effect, but, there, is, something, behind, the, will, which, is, free, vivekananda, never, said, things, were, absolutely, determined, and, placed, emphasis, on, the, power, of, conscious, choice, to, alter, one, s, past, karma, it, is, the, coward, and, the, fool, who, says, this, is, his, fate, but, it, is, the, strong, man, who, stands, up, and, says, i, will, make, my, own, fate, science, has, contributed, to, the, free, will, problem, in, at, least, three, ways, first, physics, has, addressed, the, question, of, whether, nature, is, deterministic, which, is, viewed, as, crucial, by, incompatibilists, compatibilists, however, view, it, as, irrelevant, second, although, free, will, can, be, defined, in, various, ways, all, of, them, involve, aspects, of, the, way, people, make, decisions, and, initiate, actions, which, have, been, studied, extensively, by, neuroscientists, some, of, the, experimental, observations, are, widely, viewed, as, implying, that, free, will, does, not, exist, or, is, an, illusion, but, many, philosophers, see, this, as, a, misunderstanding, third, psychologists, have, studied, the, beliefs, that, the, majority, of, ordinary, people, hold, about, free, will, and, its, role, in, assigning, moral, responsibility, from, an, anthropological, perspective, free, will, can, be, regarded, as, an, explanation, for, human, behavior, that, justifies, a, socially, sanctioned, system, of, rewards, and, punishments, under, this, definition, free, will, may, be, described, as, a, political, ideology, in, a, society, where, people, are, taught, to, believe, that, humans, have, free, will, free, will, may, be, described, as, a, political, doctrine, early, scientific, thought, often, portrayed, the, universe, as, deterministic, for, example, in, the, thought, of, democritus, or, the, c, rv, kans, and, some, thinkers, claimed, that, the, simple, process, of, gathering, sufficient, information, would, allow, them, to, predict, future, events, with, perfect, accuracy, modern, science, on, the, other, hand, is, a, mixture, of, deterministic, and, stochastic, theories, quantum, mechanics, predicts, events, only, in, terms, of, probabilities, casting, doubt, on, whether, the, universe, is, deterministic, at, all, although, evolution, of, the, universal, state, vector, is, completely, deterministic, current, physical, theories, cannot, resolve, the, question, of, whether, determinism, is, true, of, the, world, being, very, far, from, a, potential, theory, of, everything, and, open, to, many, different, interpretations, assuming, that, an, indeterministic, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, is, correct, one, may, still, object, that, such, indeterminism, is, for, all, practical, purposes, confined, to, microscopic, phenomena, this, is, not, always, the, case, many, macroscopic, phenomena, are, based, on, quantum, effects, for, instance, some, hardware, random, number, generators, work, by, amplifying, quantum, effects, into, practically, usable, signals, a, more, significant, question, is, whether, the, indeterminism, of, quantum, mechanics, allows, for, the, traditional, idea, of, free, will, based, on, a, perception, of, free, will, if, a, person, s, action, is, however, only, a, result, of, complete, quantum, randomness, mental, processes, as, experienced, have, no, influence, on, the, probabilistic, outcomes, such, as, volition, according, to, many, interpretations, indeterminism, enables, free, will, to, exist, while, others, assert, the, opposite, because, the, action, was, not, controllable, by, the, physical, being, who, claims, to, possess, the, free, will, like, physicists, biologists, have, frequently, addressed, questions, related, to, free, will, one, of, the, most, heated, debates, in, biology, is, that, of, nature, versus, nurture, concerning, the, relative, importance, of, genetics, and, biology, as, compared, to, culture, and, environment, in, human, behavior, the, view, of, many, researchers, is, that, many, human, behaviors, can, be, explained, in, terms, of, humans, brains, genes, and, evolutionary, histories, this, point, of, view, raises, the, fear, that, such, attribution, makes, it, impossible, to, hold, others, responsible, for, their, actions, steven, pinker, s, view, is, that, fear, of, determinism, in, the, context, of, genetics, and, evolution, is, a, mistake, that, it, is, a, confusion, of, explanation, with, exculpation, responsibility, does, not, require, that, behavior, be, uncaused, as, long, as, behavior, responds, to, praise, and, blame, moreover, it, is, not, certain, that, environmental, determination, is, any, less, threatening, to, free, will, than, genetic, determination, it, has, become, possible, to, study, the, living, brain, and, researchers, can, now, watch, the, brain, s, decision, making, process, at, work, a, seminal, experiment, in, this, field, was, conducted, by, benjamin, libet, in, the, 1980s, in, which, he, asked, each, subject, to, choose, a, random, moment, to, flick, their, wrist, while, he, measured, the, associated, activity, in, their, brain, in, particular, the, build, up, of, electrical, signal, called, the, readiness, potential, after, german, bereitschaftspotential, which, was, discovered, by, kornhuber, deecke, in, 1965, although, it, was, well, known, that, the, readiness, potential, reliably, preceded, the, physical, action, libet, asked, whether, it, could, be, recorded, before, the, conscious, intention, to, move, to, determine, when, subjects, felt, the, intention, to, move, he, asked, them, to, watch, the, second, hand, of, a, clock, after, making, a, movement, the, volunteer, reported, the, time, on, the, clock, when, they, first, felt, the, conscious, intention, to, move, this, became, known, as, libet, s, w, time, libet, found, that, the, unconscious, brain, activity, of, the, readiness, potential, leading, up, to, subjects, movements, began, approximately, half, a, second, before, the, subject, was, aware, of, a, conscious, intention, to, move, these, studies, of, the, timing, between, actions, and, the, conscious, decision, bear, upon, the, role, of, the, brain, in, understanding, free, will, a, subject, s, declaration, of, intention, to, move, a, finger, appears, after, the, brain, has, begun, to, implement, the, action, suggesting, to, some, that, unconsciously, the, brain, has, made, the, decision, before, the, conscious, mental, act, to, do, so, some, believe, the, implication, is, that, free, will, was, not, involved, in, the, decision, and, is, an, illusion, the, first, of, these, experiments, reported, the, brain, registered, activity, related, to, the, move, about, 0, 2, s, before, movement, onset, however, these, authors, also, found, that, awareness, of, action, was, anticipatory, to, activity, in, the, muscle, underlying, the, movement, the, entire, process, resulting, in, action, involves, more, steps, than, just, the, onset, of, brain, activity, the, bearing, of, these, results, upon, notions, of, free, will, appears, complex, some, argue, that, placing, the, question, of, free, will, in, the, context, of, motor, control, is, too, narrow, the, objection, is, that, the, time, scales, involved, in, motor, control, are, very, short, and, motor, control, involves, a, great, deal, of, unconscious, action, with, much, physical, movement, entirely, unconscious, on, that, basis, free, will, cannot, be, squeezed, into, time, frames, of, 150, 350, ms, free, will, is, a, longer, term, phenomenon, and, free, will, is, a, higher, level, activity, that, cannot, be, captured, in, a, description, of, neural, activity, or, of, muscle, activation, the, bearing, of, timing, experiments, upon, free, will, is, still, under, discussion, more, studies, have, since, been, conducted, including, some, that, try, to, benjamin, libet, s, results, are, quoted, in, favor, of, epiphenomenalism, but, he, believes, subjects, still, have, a, conscious, veto, since, the, readiness, potential, does, not, invariably, lead, to, an, action, in, freedom, evolves, daniel, dennett, argues, that, a, no, free, will, conclusion, is, based, on, dubious, assumptions, about, the, location, of, consciousness, as, well, as, questioning, the, accuracy, and, interpretation, of, libet, s, results, kornhuber, and, deecke, underlined, that, absence, of, conscious, will, during, the, early, bereitschaftspotential, termed, bp1, is, not, a, proof, of, the, non, existence, of, free, will, as, also, unconscious, agendas, may, be, free, and, non, deterministic, according, to, their, suggestion, man, has, relative, freedom, i, e, freedom, in, degrees, that, can, be, increased, or, decreased, through, deliberate, choices, that, involve, both, conscious, and, unconscious, panencephalic, processes, others, have, argued, that, data, such, as, the, bereitschaftspotential, undermine, epiphenomenalism, for, the, same, reason, that, such, experiments, rely, on, a, subject, reporting, the, point, in, time, at, which, a, conscious, experience, occurs, thus, relying, on, the, subject, to, be, able, to, consciously, perform, an, action, that, ability, would, seem, to, be, at, odds, with, early, epiphenomenalism, which, according, to, huxley, is, the, broad, claim, that, consciousness, is, completely, without, any, power, as, the, steam, whistle, which, accompanies, the, work, of, a, locomotive, engine, is, without, influence, upon, its, machinery, adrian, g, guggisberg, and, anna, s, mottaz, have, also, challenged, those, findings, a, study, by, aaron, schurger, and, colleagues, published, in, the, proceedings, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, challenged, assumptions, about, the, causal, nature, of, the, readiness, potential, itself, and, the, pre, movement, buildup, of, neural, activity, in, general, casting, doubt, on, conclusions, drawn, from, studies, such, as, libet, s, and, fried, s, a, study, that, compared, deliberate, and, arbitrary, decisions, found, that, the, early, signs, of, decision, are, absent, for, the, deliberate, ones, it, has, been, shown, that, in, several, brain, related, conditions, individuals, cannot, entirely, control, their, own, actions, though, the, existence, of, such, conditions, does, not, directly, refute, the, existence, of, free, will, neuroscientific, studies, are, valuable, tools, in, developing, models, of, how, humans, experience, free, will, for, example, people, with, tourette, syndrome, and, related, tic, disorders, make, involuntary, movements, and, utterances, called, tics, despite, the, fact, that, they, would, prefer, not, to, do, so, when, it, is, socially, inappropriate, tics, are, described, as, semi, voluntary, or, unvoluntary, because, they, are, not, strictly, involuntary, they, may, be, experienced, as, a, voluntary, response, to, an, unwanted, premonitory, urge, tics, are, experienced, as, irresistible, and, must, eventually, be, expressed, people, with, tourette, syndrome, are, sometimes, able, to, suppress, their, tics, for, limited, periods, but, doing, so, often, results, in, an, explosion, of, tics, afterward, the, control, exerted, from, seconds, to, hours, at, a, time, may, merely, postpone, and, exacerbate, the, ultimate, expression, of, the, tic, in, alien, hand, syndrome, the, affected, individual, s, limb, will, produce, unintentional, movements, without, the, will, of, the, person, the, affected, limb, effectively, demonstrates, a, will, of, its, own, the, sense, of, agency, does, not, emerge, in, conjunction, with, the, overt, appearance, of, the, purposeful, act, even, though, the, sense, of, ownership, in, relationship, to, the, body, part, is, maintained, this, phenomenon, corresponds, with, an, impairment, in, the, premotor, mechanism, manifested, temporally, by, the, appearance, of, the, readiness, potential, recordable, on, the, scalp, several, hundred, milliseconds, before, the, overt, appearance, of, a, spontaneous, willed, movement, using, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, with, specialized, multivariate, analyses, to, study, the, temporal, dimension, in, the, activation, of, the, cortical, network, associated, with, voluntary, movement, in, human, subjects, an, anterior, to, posterior, sequential, activation, process, beginning, in, the, supplementary, motor, area, on, the, medial, surface, of, the, frontal, lobe, and, progressing, to, the, primary, motor, cortex, and, then, to, parietal, cortex, has, been, observed, the, sense, of, agency, thus, appears, to, normally, emerge, in, conjunction, with, this, orderly, sequential, network, activation, incorporating, premotor, association, cortices, together, with, primary, motor, cortex, in, particular, the, supplementary, motor, complex, on, the, medial, surface, of, the, frontal, lobe, appears, to, activate, prior, to, primary, motor, cortex, presumably, in, associated, with, a, preparatory, pre, movement, process, in, a, recent, study, using, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, alien, movements, were, characterized, by, a, relatively, isolated, activation, of, the, primary, motor, cortex, contralateral, to, the, alien, hand, while, voluntary, movements, of, the, same, body, part, included, the, natural, activation, of, motor, association, cortex, associated, with, the, premotor, process, the, clinical, definition, requires, feeling, that, one, limb, is, foreign, or, has, a, will, of, its, own, together, with, observable, involuntary, motor, activity, emphasis, in, original, this, syndrome, is, often, a, result, of, damage, to, the, corpus, callosum, either, when, it, is, severed, to, treat, intractable, epilepsy, or, due, to, a, stroke, the, standard, neurological, explanation, is, that, the, felt, will, reported, by, the, speaking, left, hemisphere, does, not, correspond, with, the, actions, performed, by, the, non, speaking, right, hemisphere, thus, suggesting, that, the, two, hemispheres, may, have, independent, senses, of, will, in, addition, one, of, the, most, important, first, rank, diagnostic, symptoms, of, schizophrenia, is, the, patient, s, delusion, of, being, controlled, by, an, external, force, people, with, schizophrenia, will, sometimes, report, that, although, they, are, acting, in, the, world, they, do, not, recall, initiating, the, particular, actions, they, performed, this, is, sometimes, likened, to, being, a, robot, controlled, by, someone, else, although, the, neural, mechanisms, of, schizophrenia, are, not, yet, clear, one, influential, hypothesis, is, that, there, is, a, breakdown, in, brain, systems, that, compare, motor, commands, with, the, feedback, received, from, the, body, known, as, proprioception, leading, to, attendant, hallucinations, and, delusions, of, control, experimental, psychology, s, contributions, to, the, free, will, debate, have, come, primarily, through, social, psychologist, daniel, wegner, s, work, on, conscious, will, in, his, book, the, illusion, of, conscious, will, wegner, summarizes, what, he, believes, is, empirical, evidence, supporting, the, view, that, human, perception, of, conscious, control, is, an, illusion, wegner, summarizes, some, empirical, evidence, that, may, suggest, that, the, perception, of, conscious, control, is, open, to, modification, or, even, manipulation, wegner, observes, that, one, event, is, inferred, to, have, caused, a, second, event, when, two, requirements, are, met, for, example, if, a, person, hears, an, explosion, and, sees, a, tree, fall, down, that, person, is, likely, to, infer, that, the, explosion, caused, the, tree, to, fall, over, however, if, the, explosion, occurs, after, the, tree, falls, down, that, is, the, first, requirement, is, not, met, or, rather, than, an, explosion, the, person, hears, the, ring, of, a, telephone, that, is, the, second, requirement, is, not, met, then, that, person, is, not, likely, to, infer, that, either, noise, caused, the, tree, to, fall, down, wegner, has, applied, this, principle, to, the, inferences, people, make, about, their, own, conscious, will, people, typically, experience, a, thought, that, is, consistent, with, a, behavior, and, then, they, observe, themselves, performing, this, behavior, as, a, result, people, infer, that, their, thoughts, must, have, caused, the, observed, behavior, however, wegner, has, been, able, to, manipulate, people, s, thoughts, and, behaviors, so, as, to, conform, to, or, violate, the, two, requirements, for, causal, inference, through, such, work, wegner, has, been, able, to, show, that, people, often, experience, conscious, will, over, behaviors, that, they, have, not, in, fact, caused, and, conversely, that, people, can, be, led, to, experience, a, lack, of, will, over, behaviors, they, did, cause, for, instance, priming, subjects, with, information, about, an, effect, increases, the, probability, that, a, person, falsely, believes, is, the, cause, the, implication, for, such, work, is, that, the, perception, of, conscious, will, which, he, says, might, be, more, accurately, labelled, as, the, emotion, of, authorship, is, not, tethered, to, the, execution, of, actual, behaviors, but, is, inferred, from, various, cues, through, an, intricate, mental, process, authorship, processing, although, many, interpret, this, work, as, a, blow, against, the, argument, for, free, will, both, psychologists, and, philosophers, have, criticized, wegner, s, theories, emily, pronin, has, argued, that, the, subjective, experience, of, free, will, is, supported, by, the, introspection, illusion, this, is, the, tendency, for, people, to, trust, the, reliability, of, their, own, introspections, while, distrusting, the, introspections, of, other, people, the, theory, implies, that, people, will, more, readily, attribute, free, will, to, themselves, rather, than, others, this, prediction, has, been, confirmed, by, three, of, pronin, and, kugler, s, experiments, when, college, students, were, asked, about, personal, decisions, in, their, own, and, their, roommate, s, lives, they, regarded, their, own, choices, as, less, predictable, staff, at, a, restaurant, described, their, co, workers, lives, as, more, determined, having, fewer, future, possibilities, than, their, own, lives, when, weighing, up, the, influence, of, different, factors, on, behavior, students, gave, desires, and, intentions, the, strongest, weight, for, their, own, behavior, but, rated, personality, traits, as, most, predictive, of, other, people, caveats, have, however, been, identified, in, studying, a, subject, s, awareness, of, mental, events, in, that, the, process, of, introspection, itself, may, alter, the, experience, regardless, of, the, validity, of, belief, in, free, will, it, may, be, beneficial, to, understand, where, the, idea, comes, from, one, contribution, is, randomness, while, it, is, established, that, randomness, is, not, the, only, factor, in, the, perception, of, the, free, will, it, has, been, shown, that, randomness, can, be, mistaken, as, free, will, due, to, its, indeterminacy, this, misconception, applies, both, when, considering, oneself, and, others, another, contribution, is, choice, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, people, s, belief, in, free, will, increases, if, presented, with, a, simple, level, of, choice, the, specificity, of, the, amount, of, choice, is, important, as, too, little, or, too, great, a, degree, of, choice, may, negatively, influence, belief, it, is, also, likely, that, the, associative, relationship, between, level, of, choice, and, perception, of, free, will, is, influentially, bidirectional, it, is, also, possible, that, one, s, desire, for, control, or, other, basic, motivational, patterns, act, as, a, third, variable, since, at, least, 1959, free, will, belief, in, individuals, has, been, analysed, with, respect, to, traits, in, social, behaviour, in, general, the, concept, of, free, will, researched, to, date, in, this, context, has, been, that, of, the, incompatibilist, or, more, specifically, the, libertarian, that, is, freedom, from, determinism, whether, people, naturally, adhere, to, an, incompatibilist, model, of, free, will, has, been, questioned, in, the, research, eddy, nahmias, has, found, that, incompatibilism, is, not, intuitive, it, was, not, adhered, to, in, that, determinism, does, not, negate, belief, in, moral, responsibility, based, on, an, empirical, study, of, people, s, responses, to, moral, dilemmas, under, a, deterministic, model, of, reality, edward, cokely, has, found, that, incompatibilism, is, intuitive, it, was, naturally, adhered, to, in, that, determinism, does, indeed, negate, belief, in, moral, responsibility, in, general, joshua, knobe, and, shaun, nichols, have, proposed, that, incompatibilism, may, or, may, not, be, intuitive, and, that, it, is, dependent, to, some, large, degree, upon, the, circumstances, whether, or, not, the, crime, incites, an, emotional, response, for, example, if, it, involves, harming, another, human, being, they, found, that, belief, in, free, will, is, a, cultural, universal, and, that, the, majority, of, participants, said, that, a, our, universe, is, indeterministic, and, b, moral, responsibility, is, not, compatible, with, determinism, studies, indicate, that, peoples, belief, in, free, will, is, inconsistent, emily, pronin, and, matthew, kugler, found, that, people, believe, they, have, more, free, will, than, others, studies, also, reveal, a, correlation, between, the, likelihood, of, accepting, a, deterministic, model, of, mind, and, personality, type, for, example, adam, feltz, and, edward, cokely, found, that, people, of, an, extrovert, personality, type, are, more, likely, to, dissociate, belief, in, determinism, from, belief, in, moral, responsibility, roy, baumeister, and, colleagues, reviewed, literature, on, the, psychological, effects, of, a, belief, or, disbelief, in, free, will, and, found, that, most, people, tend, to, believe, in, a, sort, of, naive, compatibilistic, free, will, the, researchers, also, found, that, people, consider, acts, more, free, when, they, involve, a, person, opposing, external, forces, planning, or, making, random, actions, notably, the, last, behaviour, random, actions, may, not, be, possible, when, participants, attempt, to, perform, tasks, in, a, random, manner, such, as, generating, random, numbers, their, behaviour, betrays, many, patterns, a, recent, 2020, survey, has, shown, that, compatibilism, is, quite, a, popular, stance, among, those, who, specialize, in, philosophy, 59, 2, belief, in, libertarianism, amounted, to, 18, 8, while, a, lack, of, belief, in, free, will, equaled, 11, 2, 79, percent, of, evolutionary, biologists, said, that, they, believe, in, free, will, according, to, a, survey, conducted, in, 2007, only, 14, percent, chose, no, free, will, and, 7, percent, did, not, answer, the, question, baumeister, and, colleagues, found, that, provoking, disbelief, in, free, will, seems, to, cause, various, negative, effects, the, authors, concluded, in, their, paper, that, it, is, belief, in, determinism, that, causes, those, negative, effects, kathleen, vohs, has, found, that, those, whose, belief, in, free, will, had, been, eroded, were, more, likely, to, cheat, in, a, study, conducted, by, roy, baumeister, after, participants, read, an, article, arguing, against, free, will, they, were, more, likely, to, lie, about, their, performance, on, a, test, where, they, would, be, rewarded, with, cash, provoking, a, rejection, of, free, will, has, also, been, associated, with, increased, aggression, and, less, helpful, behaviour, however, although, these, initial, studies, suggested, that, believing, in, free, will, is, associated, with, more, morally, praiseworthy, behavior, more, recent, studies, including, direct, multi, site, replications, with, substantially, larger, sample, sizes, have, reported, contradictory, findings, typically, no, association, between, belief, in, free, will, and, moral, behavior, casting, doubt, over, the, original, findings, an, alternative, explanation, builds, on, the, idea, that, subjects, tend, to, confuse, determinism, with, fatalism, what, happens, then, when, agents, self, efficacy, is, undermined, it, is, not, that, their, basic, desires, and, drives, are, defeated, it, is, rather, i, suggest, that, they, become, skeptical, that, they, can, control, those, desires, and, in, the, face, of, that, skepticism, they, fail, to, apply, the, effort, that, is, needed, even, to, try, if, they, were, tempted, to, behave, badly, then, coming, to, believe, in, fatalism, makes, them, less, likely, to, resist, that, temptation, richard, holton, moreover, whether, or, not, these, experimental, findings, are, a, result, of, actual, manipulations, in, belief, in, free, will, is, a, matter, of, debate, first, of, all, free, will, can, at, least, refer, to, either, libertarian, indeterministic, free, will, or, compatibilistic, deterministic, free, will, having, participants, read, articles, that, simply, disprove, free, will, is, unlikely, to, increase, their, understanding, of, determinism, or, the, compatibilistic, free, will, that, it, still, permits, in, other, words, experimental, manipulations, purporting, to, provoke, disbelief, in, free, will, may, instead, cause, a, belief, in, fatalism, which, may, provide, an, alternative, explanation, for, previous, experimental, findings, to, test, the, effects, of, belief, in, determinism, it, has, been, argued, that, future, studies, would, need, to, provide, articles, that, do, not, simply, attack, free, will, but, instead, focus, on, explaining, determinism, and, compatibilism, baumeister, and, colleagues, also, note, that, volunteers, disbelieving, in, free, will, are, less, capable, of, counterfactual, thinking, this, is, worrying, because, counterfactual, thinking, if, i, had, done, something, different, is, an, important, part, of, learning, from, one, s, choices, including, those, that, harmed, others, again, this, cannot, be, taken, to, mean, that, belief, in, determinism, is, to, blame, these, are, the, results, we, would, expect, from, increasing, people, s, belief, in, fatalism, along, similar, lines, tyler, stillman, has, found, that, belief, in, free, will, predicts, better, job, performance, the, notions, of, free, will, and, predestination, are, heavily, debated, among, christians, free, will, in, the, christian, sense, is, the, ability, to, choose, between, good, or, evil, among, catholics, there, are, those, holding, to, thomism, adopted, from, what, thomas, aquinas, put, forth, in, the, summa, theologica, there, are, also, some, holding, to, molinism, which, was, put, forth, by, jesuit, priest, luis, de, molina, among, protestants, there, is, arminianism, held, primarily, by, the, methodist, churches, and, formulated, by, dutch, theologian, jacobus, arminius, and, there, is, also, calvinism, held, by, most, in, the, reformed, tradition, which, was, formulated, by, the, french, reformed, theologian, john, calvin, john, calvin, was, heavily, influenced, by, augustine, of, hippo, views, on, predestination, put, forth, in, his, work, on, the, predestination, of, the, saints, martin, luther, seems, to, have, held, views, on, predestination, similar, to, calvinism, in, his, on, the, bondage, of, the, will, thus, rejecting, free, will, in, condemnation, of, calvin, and, luther, views, the, roman, catholic, council, of, trent, declared, that, the, free, will, of, man, moved, and, excited, by, god, can, by, its, consent, co, operate, with, god, who, excites, and, invites, its, action, and, that, it, can, thereby, dispose, and, prepare, itself, to, obtain, the, grace, of, justification, the, will, can, resist, grace, if, it, chooses, it, is, not, like, a, lifeless, thing, which, remains, purely, passive, weakened, and, diminished, by, adam, s, fall, free, will, is, yet, not, destroyed, in, the, race, sess, vi, cap, i, and, v, john, wesley, the, father, of, the, methodist, tradition, taught, that, humans, enabled, by, prevenient, grace, have, free, will, through, which, they, can, choose, god, and, to, do, good, works, with, the, goal, of, christian, perfection, upholding, synergism, the, belief, that, god, and, man, cooperate, in, salvation, methodism, teaches, that, our, lord, jesus, christ, did, so, die, for, all, men, as, to, make, salvation, attainable, by, every, man, that, cometh, into, the, world, if, men, are, not, saved, that, fault, is, entirely, their, own, lying, solely, in, their, own, unwillingness, to, obtain, the, salvation, offered, to, them, john, 1, 9, i, thess, 5, 9, titus, 2, 11, 12, paul, the, apostle, discusses, predestination, in, some, of, his, epistles, for, whom, he, foreknew, he, also, predestined, to, become, conformed, to, the, image, of, his, son, that, he, might, be, the, first, born, among, many, brethren, and, whom, he, predestined, these, he, also, called, and, whom, he, called, these, he, also, justified, and, whom, he, justified, these, he, also, glorified, romans, 8, 29, 30, he, predestined, us, to, adoption, as, sons, through, jesus, christ, to, himself, according, to, the, kind, intention, of, his, will, ephesians, 1, 5, there, are, also, mentions, of, moral, freedom, in, what, are, now, termed, as, deuterocanonical, works, which, the, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, use, in, sirach, 15, the, text, states, do, not, say, it, was, god, s, doing, that, i, fell, away, for, what, he, hates, he, does, not, do, do, not, say, he, himself, has, led, me, astray, for, he, has, no, need, of, the, wicked, abominable, wickedness, the, lord, hates, and, he, does, not, let, it, happen, to, those, who, fear, him, god, in, the, beginning, created, human, beings, and, made, them, subject, to, their, own,

before, everyone, are, life, and, death, whichever, they, choose, will, be, given, them, immense, is, the, wisdom, of, the, lord, mighty, in, power, he, sees, all, things, the, eyes, of, god, behold, his, works, and, he, understands, every, human, deed, he, never, commands, anyone, to, sin, nor, shows, leniency, toward, deceivers, ben, sira, 15, 11, 20, nabre, the, exact, meaning, of, these, verses, has, been, debated, by, christian, theologians, throughout, history, in, jewish, thought, the, concept, of, free, will, hebrew, romanized, bechirah, chofshit, bechirah, is, foundational, the, most, succinct, statement, is, by, maimonides, in, a, two, part, treatment, where, human, free, will, is, specified, as, part, of, the, universe, s, godly, design, in, islam, the, theological, issue,

happens, with, the, permission, of, god, the, philosopher, s, ren, kierkegaard, claimed, that, divine, omnipotence, cannot, be, separated, from, divine, goodness, as, a, truly, omnipotent, and, good, being, god, could, create, beings, with, true, freedom, over, god, furthermore, god, would, voluntarily, do, so, because, the, greatest, good, which, can, be, done, for, a, being, greater, than, anything, else, that, one, can, do, for, it, is, to, be, truly, free, alvin, plantinga, s, free, will, defense, is, a, contemporary, expansion, of, this, theme, adding, how, god, free, will, and, evil, are, consistent, some, philosophers, follow, william, of, ockham, in, holding, that, necessity, and, possibility, are, defined, with, respect, to, a, given, point, in, time, and, a, given, matrix, of, empirical, circumstances, and, so, something, that, is, merely, possible, from, the, perspective, of, one, observer, may, be, necessary, from, the, perspective, of, an, omniscient, some,
