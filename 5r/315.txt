https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry
freemasonry, or, masonry, refers, to, various, fraternal, organisations, that, trace, their, origins, to, the, local, guilds, of, stonemasons, that, from, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, regulated, the, qualifications, of, stonemasons, and, their, interaction, with, authorities, and, clients, freemasonry, is, the, oldest, fraternity, in, the, world, and, among, the, oldest, continued, organizations, in, history, modern, freemasonry, broadly, consists, of, two, main, recognition, groups, regular, freemasonry, which, insists, that, a, volume, of, scripture, be, open, in, a, working, lodge, that, every, member, professes, belief, in, a, supreme, being, that, no, women, be, admitted, and, that, the, discussion, of, religion, and, politics, do, not, take, place, within, the, lodge, and, continental, freemasonry, which, consists, of, the, jurisdictions, that, have, removed, some, or, all, of, these, restrictions, the, basic, local, organisational, unit, of, freemasonry, is, the, lodge, these, private, lodges, are, usually, supervised, at, the, regional, level, usually, coterminous, with, a, state, province, or, national, border, by, a, grand, lodge, or, grand, orient, there, is, no, international, worldwide, grand, lodge, that, supervises, all, of, freemasonry, each, grand, lodge, is, independent, and, they, do, not, necessarily, recognise, each, other, as, being, legitimate, the, degrees, of, freemasonry, retain, the, three, grades, of, medieval, craft, guilds, those, of, entered, apprentice, journeyman, or, fellow, now, called, fellowcraft, and, master, mason, the, candidate, of, these, three, degrees, is, progressively, taught, the, meanings, of, the, symbols, of, freemasonry, and, entrusted, with, grips, signs, and, words, to, signify, to, other, members, that, he, has, been, so, initiated, the, degrees, are, part, allegorical, morality, play, and, part, lecture, these, three, degrees, form, craft, or, blue, lodge, freemasonry, and, members, of, any, of, these, degrees, are, known, as, freemasons, or, masons, once, the, craft, degrees, have, been, conferred, upon, a, mason, he, is, qualified, to, join, various, concordant, bodies, which, offer, additional, degrees, these, organisations, are, usually, administered, separately, from, the, grand, lodges, who, administer, the, craft, degrees, the, extra, degrees, vary, with, locality, and, jurisdiction, in, addition, to, these, bodies, there, are, further, organizations, outside, of, the, more, traditional, rites, of, freemasonry, that, require, an, individual, to, be, a, master, mason, before, they, can, join, such, as, the, rosicrucian, society, of, england, throughout, its, history, freemasonry, has, received, criticism, and, opposition, on, religious, and, political, grounds, the, catholic, church, some, protestant, denominations, and, certain, islamic, countries, or, entities, have, expressed, opposition, to, or, banned, membership, in, freemasonry, opposition, to, freemasonry, is, sometimes, rooted, in, anti, semitism, or, conspiracy, theories, and, freemasons, have, historically, been, persecuted, by, authoritarian, states, the, masonic, lodge, is, the, basic, organisational, unit, of, freemasonry, the, lodge, meets, regularly, and, conducts, the, usual, formal, business, of, any, small, organisation, approve, minutes, elect, new, members, appoint, officers, and, take, their, reports, consider, correspondence, bills, and, annual, accounts, organise, social, and, charitable, events, etc, in, addition, to, such, business, the, meeting, may, perform, a, ceremony, to, confer, a, masonic, degree, or, receive, a, lecture, which, is, usually, on, some, aspect, of, masonic, history, or, ritual, at, the, conclusion, of, the, meeting, the, lodge, may, hold, a, formal, dinner, or, festive, board, sometimes, involving, toasting, and, song, the, bulk, of, masonic, ritual, consists, of, degree, ceremonies, candidates, for, freemasonry, are, progressively, initiated, into, freemasonry, first, in, the, degree, of, entered, apprentice, at, some, later, time, in, separate, ceremonies, they, will, be, passed, to, the, degree, of, fellowcraft, and, then, raised, to, the, degree, of, master, mason, in, each, of, these, ceremonies, the, candidate, must, first, take, the, new, obligations, of, the, degree, and, is, then, entrusted, with, secret, knowledge, including, passwords, signs, and, grips, secret, handshakes, confined, to, his, new, rank, although, these, symbols, and, gestures, are, nominally, secret, they, are, readily, found, in, public, sources, including, those, published, by, masonic, organizations, themselves, another, ceremony, is, the, annual, installation, of, the, master, of, the, lodge, and, his, appointed, or, elected, officers, in, some, jurisdictions, an, installed, master, elected, obligated, and, invested, to, preside, over, a, lodge, is, valued, as, a, separate, rank, with, its, own, secrets, and, distinctive, title, and, attributes, after, each, full, year, in, the, chair, the, master, invests, his, elected, successor, and, becomes, a, past, master, with, privileges, in, the, lodge, and, grand, lodge, in, other, jurisdictions, the, grade, is, not, recognised, and, no, inner, ceremony, conveys, new, secrets, during, the, installation, of, a, new, master, of, the, lodge, most, lodges, have, some, sort, of, social, functions, allowing, members, their, partners, and, non, masonic, guests, to, meet, openly, often, coupled, with, these, events, is, the, discharge, of, every, mason, s, and, lodge, s, collective, obligation, to, contribute, to, charity, this, occurs, at, many, levels, including, in, annual, dues, subscriptions, fundraising, events, lodges, and, grand, lodges, masons, and, their, charities, contribute, for, the, relief, of, need, in, many, fields, such, as, education, health, and, old, age, private, lodges, form, the, backbone, of, freemasonry, with, the, sole, right, to, elect, their, own, candidates, for, initiation, as, masons, or, admission, as, joining, masons, and, sometimes, with, exclusive, rights, over, residents, local, to, their, premises, there, are, non, local, lodges, where, masons, meet, for, wider, or, narrower, purposes, such, or, in, association, with, some, hobby, sport, masonic, research, business, profession, regiment, or, college, the, rank, of, master, mason, also, entitles, a, freemason, to, explore, masonry, further, through, other, degrees, administered, separately, from, the, basic, craft, or, blue, lodge, degrees, described, here, but, generally, having, a, similar, structure, and, meetings, there, is, much, diversity, and, little, consistency, in, freemasonry, because, each, masonic, jurisdiction, is, independent, and, sets, its, own, rules, and, procedures, while, grand, lodges, have, limited, jurisdiction, over, their, constituent, member, lodges, which, are, ultimately, private, clubs, the, wording, of, the, ritual, the, number, of, officers, present, the, layout, of, the, meeting, room, etc, varies, from, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, almost, all, officers, of, a, lodge, are, elected, or, appointed, annually, every, masonic, lodge, has, a, master, two, wardens, a, treasurer, and, a, secretary, there, is, also, always, a, tyler, or, outer, guard, outside, the, door, of, a, working, lodge, who, may, be, paid, to, secure, its, privacy, other, offices, vary, between, jurisdictions, each, masonic, lodge, exists, and, operates, according, to, ancient, principles, known, as, the, landmarks, of, freemasonry, which, elude, any, universally, accepted, definition, candidates, for, freemasonry, will, usually, have, met, the, most, active, members, of, the, lodge, they, are, joining, before, being, elected, for, initiation, the, process, varies, among, grand, lodges, but, in, modern, times, interested, people, often, look, up, a, local, lodge, through, the, internet, and, will, typically, be, introduced, to, a, lodge, social, function, or, open, evening, the, onus, is, upon, candidates, to, ask, to, join, while, they, may, be, encouraged, to, ask, they, may, not, be, invited, once, the, initial, inquiry, is, made, a, formal, application, may, be, proposed, and, seconded, or, announced, in, open, lodge, and, a, more, or, less, formal, interview, usually, follows, if, the, candidate, wishes, to, proceed, references, are, taken, up, during, a, period, of, notice, so, that, members, may, enquire, into, the, candidate, s, suitability, and, discuss, it, finally, the, lodge, takes, an, officially, secret, ballot, on, each, application, before, a, candidate, is, either, initiated, or, rejected, the, exact, number, of, adverse, ballots, blackballs, required, to, reject, a, candidate, varies, between, masonic, jurisdictions, as, an, example, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, only, requires, a, single, blackball, while, the, grand, lodge, of, new, york, requires, three, a, minimum, requirement, of, every, body, of, freemasons, is, that, each, candidate, must, be, free, and, of, good, reputation, the, question, of, freedom, a, standard, feudal, requirement, of, mediaeval, guilds, is, nowadays, one, of, independence, the, object, is, that, every, mason, should, be, a, proper, and, responsible, person, thus, each, grand, lodge, has, a, standard, minimum, age, varying, greatly, and, often, subject, to, dispensation, in, particular, cases, for, example, in, england, the, standard, minimum, age, to, join, is, 18, but, university, lodges, are, given, dispensations, to, initiate, undergraduates, below, that, age, additionally, most, grand, lodges, require, a, candidate, to, declare, a, belief, in, a, supreme, being, although, every, candidate, must, interpret, this, condition, in, his, own, way, as, all, religious, discussion, is, commonly, prohibited, in, a, few, cases, the, candidate, may, be, required, to, be, of, a, specific, religion, the, form, of, freemasonry, most, common, in, scandinavia, known, as, the, swedish, rite, for, example, accepts, only, christians, at, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, liberal, or, continental, freemasonry, exemplified, by, the, grand, orient, de, france, does, not, require, a, declaration, of, belief, in, any, deity, and, accepts, atheists, the, cause, of, the, distinction, from, the, rest, of, freemasonry, during, the, ceremony, of, initiation, the, candidate, is, required, to, undertake, an, obligation, swearing, on, the, religious, volume, sacred, to, his, personal, faith, to, do, good, as, a, mason, in, the, course, of, three, degrees, masons, will, promise, to, keep, the, secrets, of, their, degree, from, lower, degrees, and, outsiders, as, far, as, practicality, and, the, law, permit, and, to, support, a, fellow, mason, in, distress, there, is, formal, instruction, as, to, the, duties, of, a, freemason, but, on, the, whole, freemasons, are, left, to, explore, the, craft, in, the, manner, they, find, most, satisfying, some, will, simply, enjoy, the, dramatics, or, the, management, and, administration, of, the, lodge, others, will, explore, the, history, ritual, and, symbolism, of, the, craft, others, will, focus, their, involvement, on, their, lodge, s, sociopolitical, side, perhaps, in, association, with, other, lodges, while, still, others, will, concentrate, on, the, lodge, s, charitable, functions, grand, lodges, and, grand, orients, are, independent, and, sovereign, bodies, that, govern, masonry, in, a, given, country, state, or, geographical, area, termed, a, jurisdiction, there, is, no, single, overarching, governing, body, that, presides, over, worldwide, freemasonry, connections, between, different, jurisdictions, depend, solely, on, mutual, recognition, estimates, of, the, worldwide, membership, of, freemasonry, in, the, early, 21st, century, ranged, from, about, two, million, to, more, than, six, the, fraternity, is, administratively, organised, into, independent, grand, lodges, or, sometimes, grand, orients, each, of, which, governs, its, own, masonic, jurisdiction, which, consists, of, subordinate, or, constituent, lodges, the, largest, single, jurisdiction, in, terms, of, membership, is, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, with, local, organisation, into, provincial, grand, lodges, possessing, a, combined, membership, estimated, at, 175, 000, the, grand, lodge, of, ireland, claims, it, has, approximately, 19, 000, members, in, the, united, states, there, are, 51, grand, lodges, one, in, each, state, and, the, district, of, columbia, which, together, have, a, total, membership, of, around, 875, 000, according, to, the, masonic, service, association, of, north, america, grand, orient, de, france, the, largest, jurisdiction, in, continental, freemasonry, in, terms, of, membership, claims, to, have, over, 50, 000, members, relations, between, grand, lodges, are, determined, by, the, concept, of, recognition, each, grand, lodge, maintains, a, list, of, other, grand, lodges, that, it, recognises, when, two, grand, lodges, recognise, and, are, in, masonic, communication, with, each, other, they, are, said, to, be, in, amity, and, the, brethren, of, each, may, visit, each, other, s, lodges, and, interact, masonically, when, two, grand, lodges, are, not, in, amity, inter, visitation, is, not, allowed, there, are, many, reasons, one, grand, lodge, will, withhold, or, withdraw, recognition, from, another, but, the, two, most, common, are, exclusive, jurisdiction, and, regularity, exclusive, jurisdiction, is, a, concept, whereby, normally, only, one, grand, lodge, will, be, recognised, in, any, geographical, area, if, two, grand, lodges, claim, jurisdiction, over, the, same, area, the, other, grand, lodges, will, have, to, choose, between, them, and, they, may, not, all, decide, to, recognise, the, same, one, in, 1849, for, example, the, grand, lodge, of, new, york, split, into, two, rival, factions, each, claiming, to, be, the, legitimate, grand, lodge, other, grand, lodges, had, to, choose, between, them, until, the, schism, was, healed, exclusive, jurisdiction, can, be, waived, when, the, two, overlapping, grand, lodges, are, themselves, in, amity, and, agree, to, share, jurisdiction, for, example, since, the, grand, lodge, of, connecticut, is, in, amity, with, the, prince, hall, grand, lodge, of, connecticut, the, principle, of, exclusive, jurisdiction, does, not, apply, and, other, grand, lodges, may, recognise, both, likewise, the, five, distinct, kinds, of, lodges, in, germany, have, nominally, united, under, one, grand, lodge, in, order, to, obtain, international, recognition, regularity, is, a, concept, based, on, adherence, to, masonic, landmarks, the, basic, membership, requirements, tenets, and, rituals, of, the, craft, each, grand, lodge, sets, its, own, definition, of, what, these, landmarks, are, and, thus, what, is, regular, and, what, is, irregular, and, the, definitions, do, not, necessarily, agree, between, grand, lodges, essentially, every, grand, lodge, will, hold, that, its, landmarks, its, requirements, tenets, and, rituals, are, regular, and, judge, other, grand, lodges, based, on, those, if, the, differences, are, significant, one, grand, lodge, may, declare, the, other, irregular, and, withdraw, or, withhold, recognition, the, most, commonly, shared, rules, for, recognition, based, on, regularity, are, those, given, by, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, in, 1929, blue, lodges, known, as, craft, lodges, in, the, united, kingdom, offer, only, the, three, traditional, degrees, in, most, jurisdictions, the, rank, of, past, or, installed, master, is, also, conferred, in, blue, craft, lodges, master, masons, are, able, to, extend, their, masonic, experience, by, taking, further, degrees, in, appendant, or, other, bodies, whether, or, not, approved, by, their, own, grand, lodge, the, ancient, and, accepted, scottish, rite, is, a, system, of, 33, degrees, including, the, three, blue, lodge, degrees, administered, by, a, local, or, national, supreme, council, this, system, is, popular, in, north, america, south, america, and, in, continental, europe, in, america, the, york, rite, with, a, similar, range, administers, three, orders, of, masonry, namely, the, royal, arch, cryptic, masonry, and, knights, templar, in, britain, separate, bodies, administer, each, order, freemasons, are, encouraged, to, join, the, holy, royal, arch, which, is, linked, to, mark, masonry, in, scotland, and, ireland, but, completely, separate, in, england, in, england, the, royal, arch, is, closely, associated, with, the, craft, automatically, having, many, grand, officers, in, common, including, h, r, h, the, duke, of, kent, as, both, grand, master, of, the, craft, and, first, grand, principal, of, the, royal, arch, the, english, knights, templar, and, cryptic, masonry, share, the, mark, grand, lodge, offices, and, staff, at, mark, masons, hall, the, ancient, and, accepted, rite, similar, to, the, scottish, rite, requires, a, member, to, proclaim, the, trinitarian, christian, faith, and, is, administered, from, duke, street, in, london, conversely, the, societas, rosicruciana, in, anglia, is, a, fully, independent, esoteric, organization, that, requires, members, be, united, grand, lodge, of, england, master, masons, in, the, nordic, countries, the, swedish, rite, is, dominant, a, variation, of, it, is, also, used, in, parts, of, germany, freemasonry, describes, itself, as, a, beautiful, system, of, morality, veiled, in, allegory, and, illustrated, by, symbols, the, symbolism, is, mainly, but, not, exclusively, drawn, from, the, tools, of, stonemasons, the, square, and, compasses, the, level, and, plumb, rule, the, trowel, the, rough, and, smooth, ashlars, among, others, moral, lessons, are, attributed, to, each, of, these, tools, although, the, assignment, is, by, no, means, consistent, the, meaning, of, the, symbolism, is, taught, and, explored, through, ritual, and, in, lectures, and, articles, by, individual, masons, who, offer, their, personal, insights, and, opinions, according, to, the, scholar, of, western, esotericism, jan, a, m, snoek, the, best, way, to, characterize, freemasonry, is, in, terms, of, what, it, is, not, rather, than, what, it, is, all, freemasons, begin, their, journey, in, the, craft, by, being, progressively, initiated, passed, and, raised, into, the, three, degrees, of, craft, or, blue, lodge, masonry, during, these, three, rituals, the, candidate, is, progressively, taught, the, masonic, symbols, and, entrusted, with, grips, or, tokens, signs, and, words, to, signify, to, other, masons, which, degrees, he, has, taken, the, dramatic, allegorical, ceremonies, include, explanatory, lectures, and, revolve, around, the, construction, of, the, temple, of, solomon, and, the, artistry, and, death, of, the, chief, architect, hiram, abiff, the, degrees, are, those, of, entered, apprentice, fellowcraft, and, master, mason, while, many, different, versions, of, these, rituals, exist, with, various, lodge, layouts, and, versions, of, the, hiramic, legend, each, version, is, recognizable, to, any, freemason, from, any, jurisdiction, in, some, jurisdictions, the, main, themes, of, each, degree, are, illustrated, by, tracing, boards, these, painted, depictions, of, masonic, themes, are, exhibited, in, the, lodge, according, to, which, degree, is, being, worked, and, are, explained, to, the, candidate, to, illustrate, the, legend, and, symbolism, of, each, degree, the, idea, of, masonic, brotherhood, probably, descends, from, a, 16th, century, legal, definition, of, a, brother, as, one, who, has, taken, an, oath, of, mutual, support, to, another, accordingly, masons, swear, at, each, degree, to, support, and, protect, their, brethren, unless, they, have, broken, the, law, in, most, lodges, the, oath, or, obligation, is, taken, on, a, volume, of, sacred, law, whichever, book, of, divine, revelation, is, appropriate, to, the, religious, beliefs, of, the, individual, brother, usually, the, bible, in, the, anglo, american, tradition, in, progressive, continental, freemasonry, books, other, than, scripture, are, permissible, a, cause, of, rupture, between, grand, lodges, since, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, masonic, historians, have, sought, the, origins, of, the, movement, in, a, series, of, similar, documents, known, as, the, old, charges, dating, from, the, regius, poem, in, about, 1425, to, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, alluding, to, the, membership, of, a, lodge, of, operative, masons, they, relate, it, to, a, mythologised, history, of, the, craft, the, duties, of, its, grades, and, the, manner, in, which, oaths, of, fidelity, are, to, be, taken, on, joining, the, 15th, century, also, sees, the, first, evidence, of, ceremonial, regalia, there, is, no, clear, mechanism, by, which, these, local, trade, organisations, became, today, s, masonic, lodges, the, earliest, rituals, and, passwords, known, from, operative, lodges, around, the, turn, of, the, 17th, 18th, centuries, show, continuity, with, the, rituals, developed, in, the, later, 18th, century, by, accepted, or, speculative, masons, as, those, members, who, did, not, practice, the, physical, craft, gradually, came, to, be, known, the, minutes, of, the, lodge, of, edinburgh, mary, s, chapel, no, 1, in, scotland, show, a, continuity, from, an, operative, lodge, in, 1598, to, a, modern, speculative, lodge, it, is, reputed, to, be, the, oldest, masonic, lodge, in, the, world, alternatively, thomas, de, quincey, in, his, work, titled, rosicrucians, and, freemasonry, put, forward, the, theory, that, suggested, that, freemasonry, may, have, been, an, outgrowth, of, rosicrucianism, the, theory, had, also, been, postulated, in, 1803, by, german, professor, j, g, buhle, the, first, grand, lodge, the, grand, lodge, of, london, and, westminster, later, called, the, grand, lodge, of, england, was, founded, on, st, john, s, day, 24, june, 1717, when, four, existing, london, lodges, met, for, a, joint, dinner, over, the, next, decade, most, of, the, existing, lodges, in, england, joined, the, new, regulatory, body, which, itself, entered, a, period, of, self, publicity, and, expansion, new, lodges, were, created, and, the, fraternity, began, to, grow, during, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, as, aristocrats, and, artists, crowded, out, the, craftsmen, originally, associated, with, the, organization, freemasonry, became, fashionable, throughout, europe, and, the, american, colonies, between, 1730, and, 1750, the, grand, lodge, endorsed, several, significant, changes, that, some, lodges, could, not, endorse, a, rival, grand, lodge, was, formed, on, 17, july, 1751, which, called, itself, the, antient, grand, lodge, of, england, to, signify, that, these, lodges, were, maintaining, older, traditions, and, rejected, changes, that, modern, lodges, had, adopted, historians, still, use, these, terms, ancients, and, moderns, to, differentiate, the, two, bodies, these, two, grand, lodges, vied, for, supremacy, until, the, moderns, promised, to, return, to, the, ancient, ritual, they, united, on, 27, december, 1813, to, form, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, the, grand, lodge, of, ireland, and, the, grand, lodge, of, scotland, were, formed, in, 1725, and, 1736, respectively, although, neither, persuaded, all, of, the, existing, lodges, in, their, countries, to, join, for, many, years, the, earliest, known, american, lodges, were, in, pennsylvania, the, collector, for, the, port, of, pennsylvania, john, moore, wrote, of, attending, lodges, there, in, 1715, two, years, before, the, putative, formation, of, the, first, grand, lodge, in, london, the, grand, lodge, of, england, appointed, a, provincial, grand, master, for, north, america, in, 1731, based, in, pennsylvania, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, grand, lodge, of, pennsylvania, in, canada, erasmus, james, philipps, became, a, freemason, while, working, on, a, commission, to, resolve, boundaries, in, new, england, and, in, 1739, he, became, provincial, grand, master, for, nova, scotia, philipps, founded, the, first, masonic, lodge, in, canada, at, annapolis, royal, nova, scotia, other, lodges, in, the, colony, of, pennsylvania, obtained, authorisations, from, the, later, antient, grand, lodge, of, england, the, grand, lodge, of, scotland, and, the, grand, lodge, of, ireland, which, was, particularly, well, represented, in, the, travelling, lodges, of, the, british, army, many, lodges, came, into, existence, with, no, warrant, from, any, grand, lodge, applying, and, paying, for, their, authorisation, only, after, they, were, confident, of, their, own, survival, after, the, american, revolution, independent, u, s, grand, lodges, developed, within, each, state, some, thought, was, briefly, given, to, organising, an, overarching, grand, lodge, of, the, united, states, with, george, washington, who, was, a, member, of, a, virginian, lodge, as, the, first, grand, master, but, the, idea, was, short, lived, the, various, state, grand, lodges, did, not, wish, to, diminish, their, own, authority, by, agreeing, to, such, a, body, on, april, 30, 1789, george, washington, took, his, oath, of, office, at, his, first, inauguration, upon, a, bible, belonging, to, st, john, s, lodge, no, 1, of, new, york, originally, it, was, expected, that, washington, would, bring, his, own, bible, upon, which, to, swear, his, oath, of, office, and, there, was, some, consternation, when, it, turned, out, that, no, one, had, informed, washington, to, bring, one, thinking, quickly, jacob, morton, the, marshal, of, the, inauguration, and, master, of, st, john, s, lodge, borrowed, the, lodge, s, bible, for, use, in, the, ceremony, that, bible, has, been, known, since, as, the, george, washington, inaugural, bible, and, is, still, in, possession, of, st, john, s, lodge, no, 1, of, the, grand, lodge, of, new, york, robert, livingston, chancellor, of, the, state, of, new, york, also, the, first, grand, master, of, the, grand, lodge, of, free, and, accepted,

immigrants, who, colonized, the, island, for, over, 300, years, in, 1908, there, were, eleven, recorded, masonic, lodges, which, included, three, grand, lodges, two, craft, lodges, and, two, rose, croix, chapters, during, slavery, the, lodges, were, open, to, all, freeborn, men, according, to, the, jamaican, 1834, census, that, potentially, included, 5, 000, free, black, men, and, 40, 000, free, people, of, colour, mixed, race, after, the, full, abolition, of, slavery, in, 1838, the, lodges, were, open, to, all, jamaican, men, of, any, race, jamaica, also, kept, close, relationships, with, masons, from, other, countries, jamaican, freemasonry, historian, jackie, ranston, noted, that, jamaica, served, as, an, arms, depot, for, the, revolutionary, forces, when, two, kingston, freemasons, wellwood, and, maxwell, hyslop, financed, the, campaigns, of, sim, n, bol, var, the, liberator, to, whom, six, latin, american, republics, owe, their, independence, bol, var, himself, was,

african, american, men, was, initiated, into, a, british, military, lodge, with, a, warrant, from, the, grand, lodge, of, ireland, having, failed, to, obtain, admission, from, the, other, lodges, in, boston, when, the, british, military, lodge, left, north, america, after, the, end, of, the, revolution, those, 15, men, were, given, the, authority, to, meet, as, a, lodge, but, not, to, initiate, masons, in, 1784, these, individuals, obtained, a, warrant, from, the, grand, lodge, of, england, moderns, and, formed, african, lodge, number, 459, when, the, two, english, grand, lodges, united, in, 1813, all, u, s, based, lodges, were, stricken, from, their, rolls, largely, because, of, the, war, of, 1812, thus, separated, from, both, english, jurisdiction, and, any, concordantly, recognised, u, s, grand, lodge, african, lodge, retitled, itself, as, the, african, lodge, number, 1, and, became, a, de, facto, grand, lodge, this, lodge, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, various, grand, lodges, in, africa, as, with, the, rest, of, u, s, freemasonry, prince, hall, freemasonry, soon, grew, and, organised, on, a, grand, lodge, system, for, each, state, unlike, other, fraternal, orders, there, was, never, any, blanket, rule, against, the, admission, of, men, based, on, their, race, each, lodge, and, grand, lodge, had, their, own, rules, both, written, and, unwritten, a, few, non, prince, hall, lodges, did, admit, blacks, with, angelo, soliman, being, one, notable, masonic, personality, of, african, descent, nonetheless, widespread, racial, segregation, in, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, north, america, made, it, difficult, for, african, americans, to, join, lodges, outside, of, prince, hall, jurisdictions, even, if, a, lodge, was, willing, to, entertain, non, white, applicants, generally, only, a, single, anonymous, vote, could, prevent, someone, from, being, admitted, inter, jurisdiction, recognition, between, traditional, and, prince, hall, u, s, masonic, authorities, was, also, not, forthcoming, as, demonstrated, by, the, case, of, the, famous, black, boxer, jack, johnson, if, word, spread, that, a, mainstream, lodge, had, admitted, a, black, person, that, lodge, could, potentially, face, sanction, from, other, discriminatory, lodges, by, the, 1980s, such, discrimination, was, a, thing, of, the, past, today, most, but, not, all, u, s, grand, lodges, recognise, their, prince, hall, counterparts, and, the, authorities, of, both, traditions, are, working, towards, full, recognition, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, has, no, problem, with, recognising, prince, hall, grand, lodges, while, celebrating, their, heritage, as, lodges, of, african, americans, prince, hall, is, open, to, all, men, regardless, of, race, or, religion, english, freemasonry, spread, to, france, in, the, 1720s, first, as, lodges, of, expatriates, and, exiled, jacobites, and, then, as, distinctively, french, lodges, that, still, follow, the, ritual, of, the, moderns, from, france, and, england, freemasonry, spread, to, most, of, continental, europe, during, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, the, grande, loge, de, france, was, formed, under, the, grand, mastership, of, the, duke, of, clermont, who, exercised, only, nominal, authority, his, successor, the, duke, of, orl, ans, reconstituted, the, central, body, as, the, grand, orient, de, france, in, 1773, briefly, eclipsed, during, the, french, revolution, french, freemasonry, continued, to, grow, in, the, next, century, at, first, under, the, leadership, of, alexandre, francois, auguste, de, grasse, comte, de, grassy, tilly, a, career, army, officer, he, lived, with, his, family, in, charleston, south, carolina, from, 1793, to, the, early, 1800s, after, leaving, saint, domingue, now, haiti, during, the, years, of, the, haitian, revolution, after, the, failure, of, the, 1830, italian, revolution, a, number, of, italian, freemasons, were, forced, to, flee, they, secretly, set, up, an, approved, chapter, of, scottish, rite, in, alexandria, a, town, already, inhabited, by, a, large, italian, community, meanwhile, the, french, freemasons, publicly, organised, a, local, chapter, in, alexandria, in, 1845, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, ottoman, empire, masonic, lodges, operated, widely, across, all, parts, of, the, empire, and, numerous, sufi, orders, shared, a, close, relationship, with, them, many, young, turks, affiliated, with, the, bektashi, order, were, members, and, patrons, of, freemasonry, they, were, also, closely, allied, against, european, imperialism, many, ottoman, intellectuals, believed, that, sufism, and, freemasonry, shared, close, similarities, in, doctrines, spiritual, outlook, and, mysticism, the, ritual, form, on, which, the, grand, orient, of, france, was, based, was, abolished, in, england, in, the, events, leading, to, the, formation, of, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, in, 1813, however, the, two, jurisdictions, continued, in, amity, or, mutual, recognition, until, events, of, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, drove, a, seemingly, permanent, wedge, between, them, in, 1868, the, supreme, council, of, the, ancient, and, accepted, scottish, rite, of, the, state, of, louisiana, appeared, in, the, jurisdiction, of, the, grand, lodge, of, louisiana, recognised, by, the, grand, orient, de, france, but, regarded, by, the, older, body, as, an, invasion, of, their, jurisdiction, the, new, scottish, rite, body, admitted, black, people, the, resolution, of, the, grand, orient, the, following, year, that, neither, colour, race, nor, religion, could, disqualify, a, man, from, masonry, prompted, the, grand, lodge, to, withdraw, recognition, and, it, persuaded, other, american, grand, lodges, to, do, the, same, a, dispute, during, the, lausanne, congress, of, supreme, councils, of, 1875, prompted, the, grand, orient, de, france, to, commission, a, report, by, a, protestant, pastor, which, concluded, that, as, freemasonry, was, not, a, religion, it, should, not, require, a, religious, belief, the, new, constitutions, read, its, principles, are, absolute, liberty, of, conscience, and, human, solidarity, the, existence, of, god, and, the, immortality, of, the, soul, being, struck, out, it, is, possible, that, the, immediate, objections, of, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, were, at, least, partly, motivated, by, the, political, tension, between, france, and, britain, at, the, time, the, result, was, the, withdrawal, of, recognition, of, the, grand, orient, of, france, by, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, a, situation, that, continues, today, not, all, french, lodges, agreed, with, the, new, wording, in, 1894, lodges, favouring, the, compulsory, recognition, of, the, great, architect, of, the, universe, formed, the, grande, loge, de, france, in, 1913, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, recognised, a, new, grand, lodge, of, regular, freemasons, a, grand, lodge, that, follows, a, similar, rite, to, anglo, american, freemasonry, with, a, mandatory, belief, in, a, deity, there, are, now, three, strands, of, freemasonry, in, france, which, extend, into, the, rest, of, continental, europe, the, term, continental, freemasonry, was, used, in, mackey, s, 1873, encyclopedia, of, freemasonry, to, designate, the, lodges, on, the, continent, of, europe, which, retain, many, usages, which, have, either, been, abandoned, by, or, never, were, observed, in, the, lodges, of, england, ireland, and, scotland, as, well, as, the, united, states, of, america, today, it, is, frequently, used, to, refer, to, only, the, liberal, jurisdictions, typified, by, the, grand, orient, de, france, the, majority, of, freemasonry, considers, the, liberal, continental, strand, to, be, irregular, and, thus, withhold, recognition, the, continental, lodges, however, did, not, want, to, sever, masonic, ties, in, 1961, an, umbrella, organisation, centre, de, liaison, et, d, information, des, puissances, ma, onniques, signataires, de, l, appel, de, strasbourg, clipsas, was, set, up, which, today, provides, a, forum, for, most, of, these, grand, lodges, and, grand, orients, worldwide, included, in, the, list, of, over, 70, grand, lodges, and, grand, orients, are, representatives, of, all, three, of, the, above, categories, including, mixed, and, women, s, organisations, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, does, not, communicate, with, any, of, these, jurisdictions, and, expects, its, allies, to, follow, suit, this, creates, the, distinction, between, anglo, american, and, continental, freemasonry, the, status, of, women, in, the, old, guilds, and, corporations, of, medieval, masons, remains, uncertain, the, principle, of, femme, sole, allowed, a, widow, to, continue, the, trade, of, her, husband, but, its, application, had, wide, local, variations, such, as, full, membership, of, a, trade, body, or, limited, trade, by, deputation, or, approved, members, of, that, body, in, masonry, the, small, available, evidence, points, to, the, less, empowered, end, of, the, scale, at, the, dawn, of, the, grand, lodge, era, during, the, 1720s, james, anderson, composed, the, first, printed, constitutions, for, freemasons, the, basis, for, most, subsequent, constitutions, which, specifically, excluded, women, from, freemasonry, as, freemasonry, spread, women, began, to, be, added, to, the, lodges, of, adoption, by, their, husbands, who, were, continental, masons, which, worked, three, degrees, with, the, same, names, as, the, men, s, but, different, content, the, french, officially, abandoned, the, experiment, in, the, early, 19th, century, later, organisations, with, a, similar, aim, emerged, in, the, united, states, but, distinguished, the, names, of, the, degrees, from, those, of, male, masonry, maria, deraismes, was, initiated, into, freemasonry, in, 1882, then, resigned, to, allow, her, lodge, to, rejoin, their, grand, lodge, having, failed, to, achieve, acceptance, from, any, masonic, governing, body, she, and, georges, martin, started, a, mixed, masonic, lodge, that, worked, masonic, ritual, annie, besant, spread, the, phenomenon, to, the, english, speaking, world, disagreements, over, ritual, led, to, the, formation, of, exclusively, female, bodies, of, freemasons, in, england, which, spread, to, other, countries, meanwhile, the, french, had, re, invented, adoption, as, an, all, female, lodge, in, 1901, only, to, cast, it, aside, again, in, 1935, the, lodges, however, continued, to, meet, which, gave, rise, in, 1959, to, a, body, of, women, practising, continental, freemasonry, in, general, continental, freemasonry, is, sympathetic, to, freemasonry, among, women, dating, from, the, 1890s, when, french, lodges, assisted, the, emergent, co, masonic, movement, by, promoting, enough, of, their, members, to, the, 33rd, degree, of, the, ancient, and, accepted, scottish, rite, to, allow, them, in, 1899, to, form, their, own, grand, council, recognised, by, the, other, continental, grand, councils, of, that, rite, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, issued, a, statement, in, 1999, recognising, the, two, women, s, grand, lodges, there, the, order, of, women, freemasons, and, the, honourable, fraternity, of, ancient, freemasons, to, be, regular, in, all, but, the, participants, while, they, were, not, therefore, recognised, as, regular, they, were, part, of, freemasonry, in, general, the, attitude, of, most, regular, anglo, american, grand, lodges, remains, that, women, freemasons, are, not, legitimate, masons, in, 2018, guidance, was, released, by, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, stating, that, in, regard, to, transgender, women, a, freemason, who, after, initiation, ceases, to, be, a, man, does, not, cease, to, be, a, freemason, the, guidance, also, states, that, transgender, men, are, allowed, to, apply, to, become, freemasons, during, the, age, of, the, enlightenment, in, the, 18th, century, freemasons, comprised, an, international, network, of, like, minded, men, often, meeting, in, secret, in, ritualistic, programs, at, their, lodges, they, promoted, the, ideals, of, the, enlightenment, and, helped, diffuse, these, values, across, britain, and, france, and, other, places, british, freemasonry, offered, a, systematic, creed, with, its, own, myths, values, and, set, of, rituals, it, fostered, new, codes, of, conduct, including, a, communal, understanding, of, liberty, and, equality, inherited, from, guild, sociability, liberty, fraternity, and, equality, scottish, soldiers, and, jacobite, scots, brought, to, the, continent, ideals, of, fraternity, which, reflected, not, the, local, system, of, scottish, customs, but, the, institutions, and, ideals, originating, in, the, english, revolution, against, royal, absolutism, freemasonry, was, particularly, prevalent, in, france, by, 1789, there, were, between, 50, 000, and, 100, 000, french, masons, making, freemasonry, the, most, popular, of, all, enlightenment, associations, jacob, argues, that, masonic, lodges, probably, had, an, effect, on, society, as, a, whole, for, they, reconstituted, the, polity, and, established, a, constitutional, form, of, self, government, complete, with, constitutions, and, laws, elections, and, representatives, in, other, words, the, micro, society, set, up, within, the, lodges, constituted, a, normative, model, for, society, as, a, whole, this, was, especially, true, on, the, continent, when, the, first, lodges, began, to, appear, in, the, 1730s, their, embodiment, of, british, values, was, often, seen, as, threatening, by, state, authorities, for, example, the, parisian, lodge, that, met, in, the, mid, 1720s, was, composed, of, english, jacobite, exiles, furthermore, freemasons, all, across, europe, made, reference, to, the, enlightenment, in, general, in, the, 18th, century, in, french, lodges, for, example, the, line, as, the, means, to, be, enlightened, i, search, for, the, enlightened, was, a, part, of, their, initiation, rites, british, lodges, assigned, themselves, the, duty, to, initiate, the, unenlightened, many, lodges, praised, the, grand, architect, the, masonic, terminology, for, the, divine, being, who, created, a, scientifically, ordered, universe, on, the, other, hand, historian, robert, roswell, palmer, noted, that, lodges, operated, separately, and, masons, politically, did, not, act, together, as, a, group, american, historians, note, that, benjamin, franklin, and, george, washington, were, leading, masons, but, the, significance, of, freemasonry, in, the, revolution, is, a, topic, of, debate, daniel, roche, contests, freemasonry, s, claims, for, egalitarianism, writing, that, the, real, equality, of, the, lodges, was, elitist, only, attracting, men, of, similar, social, backgrounds, in, long, term, historical, perspective, norman, davies, has, argued, that, freemasonry, was, a, powerful, force, in, europe, from, about, 1700, to, the, twentieth, century, it, expanded, rapidly, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, reaching, practically, every, country, in, europe, as, well, as, the, european, colonies, in, the, new, world, and, asia, davies, states, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, beyond, it, would, be, strongly, associated, with, the, cause, of, liberalism, in, catholic, lands, it, was, anti, clerical, and, came, under, heavy, attack, from, the, catholic, church, in, the, 20th, century, it, was, suppressed, by, fascist, and, communist, regimes, it, was, especially, attractive, to, royalty, aristocrats, and, politicians, and, businessmen, as, well, as, intellectuals, artists, and, political, activists, davies, notes, that, prominent, members, included, montesquieu, voltaire, sir, robert, walpole, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, benjamin, franklin, and, george, washington, steven, bullock, notes, that, in, the, late, 18th, century, english, lodges, were, headed, by, the, prince, of, wales, prussian, lodges, by, king, frederick, the, great, and, french, lodges, by, royal, princes, emperor, napoleon, selected, his, own, brother, as, the, grand, master, of, france, in, the, 18th, century, liberal, french, politicians, met, together, in, masonic, lodges, to, develop, some, of, the, enlightenment, ideas, that, dominated, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, avner, halpern, has, traced, french, freemasonry, s, major, role, in, building, france, s, first, modern, political, party, in, 1901, the, radical, party, it, used, two, masonic, devices, the, civil, leadership, model, which, freemasonry, developed, in, late, 19th, century, france, and, the, local, masonic, congresses, of, the, grand, orient, of, france, federations, freemasons, had, been, active, in, russia, in, the, 18th, century, working, to, introduce, enlightenment, ideals, however, they, were, increasingly, suppressed, by, the, government, according, to, ludwick, hass, freemasonry, was, officially, illegal, in, tsarist, russia, but, would, later, be, introduced, by, exiles, who, returned, after, the, 1905, revolution, these, individuals, had, been, active, masons, in, paris, where, lodges, were, politically, active, in, the, new, radical, party, in, russia, the, freemasons, supported, constitutional, liberalism, and, maintained, ties, with, france, while, simplifying, many, of, the, ceremonial, rituals, their, secret, meetings, became, a, centre, of, progressive, ideals,

to, political, power, with, the, overthrow, of, the, czars, in, 1917, the, organization, collapsed, as, the, bolsheviks, took, power, and, was, again, outlawed, according, to, adrian, lyttelton, in, the, early, 20th, century, freemasonry, was, an, influential, but, semi, secret, force, in, italian, politics, with, a, strong, presence, among, professionals, and, the, middle, class, across, italy,

had, around, 25, 000, members, in, some, 500, lodges, freemasons, typically, espoused, anticlericalism, and, promoted, unification, the, catholic, church, was, a, vigorous, opponent, of, unification, and, thus, of, the, freemasons, various, national, governments, would, repeatedly, alternate, and, backpedal, between, the, anticlerical, side, and, the, church, side, politically, they, promoted,

leaders, in, organizing, the, march, on, rome, were, masons, the, lodges, hailed, fascism, as, the, saviour, of, italy, from, bolshevism, however, mussolini, decided, he, needed, to, come, to, terms, with, the, catholic, church, in, the, mid, 1920s, outlawing, freemasonry, the, spanish, government, outlawed, freemasonry, in, its, overseas, empire, in, the, mid, 18th, century, and, energetically,

is, still, in, use, in, america, today, both, by, masons, in, referring, to, their, critics, and, as, a, self, descriptor, by, the, critics, themselves, freemasonry, has, attracted, criticism, from, theocratic, states, and, organised, religions, that, believe, it, is, in, competition, with, religion, or, perceive, the, fraternity, s, views, or, practices, as, heterodox, it, has, also, long, been, the, target, of, conspiracy, theories, that, assert, freemasonry, to, be, an, occult, and, evil, power, although, members, of, various, faiths, cite, objections, certain, christian, denominations, have, had, high, profile, negative, attitudes, to, masonry, banning, or, discouraging, their, members, from, being, freemasons, the, denomination, with, the, longest, history, of, objection, to, freemasonry, is, the, catholic, church, the, objections, raised, by, the, catholic, church, are, based, on, the, allegation, that, masonry, teaches, a, naturalistic, deistic, religion, which, is, in, conflict, with, church, doctrine, more, than, 600, papal, pronouncements, have, been, issued, against, freemasonry, the, first, was, pope, clement, xii, s, in, eminenti, apostolatus, 28, april, 1738, the, most, recent, was, pope, francis, in, a, letter, by, the, dicastery, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, 13, november, 2023, the, 1917, code, of, canon, law, explicitly, declared, that, joining, freemasonry, entailed, automatic, excommunication, and, banned, books, favouring, freemasonry, in, 1983, the, church, issued, a, new, code, of, canon, law, unlike, its, predecessor, the, 1983, code, of, canon, law, did, not, explicitly, name, masonic, orders, among, the, secret, societies, it, condemns, it, states, a, person, who, joins, an, association, which, plots, against, the, church, is, to, be, punished, with, a, just, penalty, one, who, promotes, or, takes, office, in, such, an, association, is, to, be, punished, with, an, interdict, this, named, omission, of, masonic, orders, caused, both, catholics, and, freemasons, to, believe, that, the, ban, on, catholics, becoming, freemasons, may, have, been, lifted, especially, after, the, perceived, liberalisation, of, vatican, ii, however, the, matter, was, clarified, when, cardinal, joseph, ratzinger, later, pope, benedict, xvi, as, the, prefect, of, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, issued, a, declaration, on, masonic, associations, which, states, the, church, s, negative, judgment, in, regard, to, masonic, association, remains, unchanged, since, their, principles, have, always, been, considered, irreconcilable, with, the, doctrine, of, the, church, and, therefore, membership, in, them, remains, forbidden, the, faithful, who, enroll, in, masonic, associations, are, in, a, state, of, grave, sin, and, may, not, receive, holy, communion, in, 2023, pope, francis, reaffirmed, the, ban, on, catholics, becoming, freemasons, stating, the, irreconcilability, between, catholic, doctrine, and, freemasonry, in, response, to, julito, cortes, bishop, of, dumanguete, who, stated, concerns, over, the, growing, number, of, freemasons, in, the, philippines, the, renewed, ban, cited, both, the, 1983, code, of, canon, law, as, well, as, the, guidelines, made, by, a, bishops, conference, in, 2003, for, its, part, freemasonry, has, never, objected, to, catholics, joining, their, fraternity, those, grand, lodges, in, amity, with, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, deny, the, church, s, claims, stating, that, freemasonry, does, not, seek, to, replace, a, mason, s, religion, or, provide, a, substitute, for, it, in, contrast, to, catholic, allegations, of, rationalism, and, naturalism, protestant, objections, are, more, likely, to, be, based, on, allegations, of, mysticism, occultism, and, even, satanism, masonic, scholar, albert, pike, is, often, quoted, in, some, cases, misquoted, by, protestant, anti, masons, as, an, authority, for, the, position, of, masonry, on, these, issues, however, pike, although, undoubtedly, learned, was, not, a, spokesman, for, freemasonry, and, was, also, controversial, among, freemasons, in, general, his, writings, represented, his, personal, opinion, only, and, furthermore, an, opinion, grounded, in, the, attitudes, and, understandings, of, late, 19th, century, southern, freemasonry, of, the, us, notably, his, book, carries, in, the, preface, a, form, of, disclaimer, from, his, own, grand, lodge, no, one, voice, has, ever, spoken, for, the, whole, of, freemasonry, in, 1993, the, southern, baptist, convention, s, home, mission, board, determined, that, some, parts, of, freemasonry, are, incompatible, with, christianity, while, others, are, compatible, concluding, that, participation, in, freemasonry, should, be, considered, a, matter, of, personal, conscience, the, topic, of, freemasonry, remains, controversial, within, the, convention, james, l, holly, president, of, mission, and, ministry, to, men, published, a, three, volume, book, series, titled, the, southern, baptist, convention, and, freemasonry, critiquing, the, report, to, the, southern, baptist, convention, in, addition, to, the, influence, of, gary, leazer, then, director, of, the, interfaith, witness, department, of, the, north, american, mission, board, gary, leazer, published, fundamentalism, and, freemasonry, arguing, that, the, convention, s, discussion, of, freemasonry, was, influenced, by, southern, baptist, convention, conservative, resurgence, free, methodist, church, founder, b, t, roberts, was, a, vocal, opponent, of, freemasonry, in, the, mid, 19th, century, roberts, opposed, the, society, on, moral, grounds, and, stated, the, god, of, the, lodge, is, not, the, god, of, the, bible, roberts, believed, freemasonry, was, a, mystery, or, alternate, religion, and, encouraged, his, church, not, to, support, ministers, who, were, freemasons, freedom, from, secret, societies, is, one, of, the, frees, upon, which, the, free, methodist, church, was, founded, since, the, founding, of, freemasonry, many, bishops, of, the, church, of, england, have, been, freemasons, including, archbishop, geoffrey, fisher, in, the, past, few, members, of, the, church, of, england, would, have, seen, any, incongruity, in, concurrently, adhering, to, anglican, christianity, and, practising, freemasonry, in, recent, decades, however, reservations, about, freemasonry, have, increased, within, anglicanism, perhaps, due, to, the, increasing, prominence, of, the, evangelical, wing, of, the, church, the, former, archbishop, of, canterbury, dr, rowan, williams, appeared, to, harbour, some, reservations, about, masonic, ritual, while, being, anxious, to, avoid, causing, offence, to, freemasons, inside, and, outside, the, church, of, england, in, 2003, he, felt, it, necessary, to, apologise, to, british, freemasons, after, he, said, that, their, beliefs, were, incompatible, with, christianity, and, that, he, had, barred, the, appointment, of, freemasons, to, senior, posts, in, his, diocese, when, he, was, bishop, of, monmouth, in, 1933, the, orthodox, church, of, greece, officially, declared, that, being, a, freemason, constitutes, an, act, of, apostasy, and, thus, until, he, repents, the, person, involved, with, freemasonry, cannot, partake, of, the, eucharist, this, has, been, generally, affirmed, throughout, the, whole, eastern, orthodox, church, the, orthodox, critique, of, freemasonry, agrees, with, both, the, catholic, and, protestant, versions, freemasonry, cannot, be, at, all, compatible, with, christianity, as, far, as, it, is, a, secret, organisation, acting, and, teaching, in, mystery, and, secret, and, deifying, rationalism, regular, freemasonry, has, traditionally, not, responded, to, these, claims, beyond, the, often, repeated, statement, that, freemasonry, explicitly, adheres, to, the, principle, that, freemasonry, is, not, a, religion, nor, a, substitute, for, religion, there, is, no, separate, masonic, deity, and, there, is, no, separate, proper, name, for, a, deity, in, freemasonry, christian, men, who, were, discouraged, from, joining, the, freemasons, by, their, churches, or, who, wanted, a, more, religiocentric, society, joined, similar, fraternal, organisations, such, as, the, knights, of, columbus, and, knights, of, peter, claver, for, catholics, and, the, royal, black, institution, for, protestants, although, these, fraternal, organisations, have, been, organized, in, part, on, the, style, of, and, use, many, symbols, of, freemasonry, there, are, some, elements, of, freemasonry, within, the, temple, rituals, of, mormonism, ottoman, caliph, mahmud, i, outlawed, freemasonry, in, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1748, ce, and, since, that, time, freemasonry, was, equated, with, atheism, in, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, broader, islamic, world, many, islamic, anti, masonic, arguments, are, closely, tied, to, antisemitic, conspiracy, theories, though, other, criticisms, are, made, such, as, linking, freemasonry, to, al, masih, ad, dajjal, the, false, messiah, in, islamic, scripture, syrian, egyptian, islamic, theologian, m, hamm, d, rash, d, rid, 1865, 1935, played, the, crucial, role, in, leading, the, opposition, to, freemasonry, across, the, islamic, world, during, the, early, twentieth, century, influenced, by, rida, islamic, anti, masons, argue, that, freemasonry, promotes, the, interests, of, the, jews, around, the, world, and, that, one, of, its, aims, is, to, destroy, the, al, aqsa, mosque, compound, in, order, to, rebuild, the, temple, of, solomon, in, jerusalem, through, his, popular, pan, islamic, journal, al, manar, rashid, rida, spread, anti, masonic, ideas, which, would, directly, influence, the, muslim, brotherhood, and, subsequent, islamist, movements, such, as, hamas, in, article, 28, of, its, covenant, hamas, states, that, freemasonry, rotary, and, other, similar, groups, work, in, the, interest, of, zionism, and, according, to, its, instructions, several, predominantly, muslim, countries, have, banned, freemasonry, within, their, borders, while, others, have, not, turkey, and, morocco, have, established, grand, lodges, while, in, countries, such, as, malaysia, and, lebanon, there, are, district, grand, lodges, operating, under, a, warrant, from, an, established, grand, lodge, in, 1972, in, pakistan, zulfiqar, ali, bhutto, then, prime, minister, of, pakistan, placed, a, ban, on, freemasonry, lodge, buildings, were, confiscated, by, the, government, masonic, lodges, existed, in, iraq, as, early, as, 1917, when, the, first, lodge, under, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, ugle, was, opened, nine, lodges, under, ugle, existed, by, the, 1950s, and, a, scottish, lodge, was, formed, in, 1923, however, the, position, changed, following, the, revolution, and, all, lodges, were, forced, to, close, in, 1965, this, position, was, later, reinforced, under, saddam, hussein, the, death, penalty, was, prescribed, for, those, who, promote, or, acclaim, zionist, principles, including, freemasonry, or, who, associate, with, zionist, organisations, in, 1799, english, freemasonry, almost, came, to, a, halt, due, to, parliamentary, proclamation, in, the, wake, of, the, french, revolution, the, unlawful, societies, act, banned, any, meetings, of, groups, that, required, their, members, to, take, an, oath, or, obligation, the, grand, masters, of, both, the, moderns, and, the, antients, grand, lodges, called, on, prime, minister, william, pitt, who, was, not, a, freemason, and, explained, to, him, that, freemasonry, was, a, supporter, of, the, law, and, lawfully, constituted, authority, and, was, much, involved, in, charitable, work, as, a, result, freemasonry, was, specifically, exempted, from, the, terms, of, the, act, provided, that, each, private, lodge, s, secretary, placed, with, the, local, clerk, of, the, peace, a, list, of, the, members, of, his, lodge, once, a, year, this, continued, until, 1967, when, the, obligation, of, the, provision, was, rescinded, by, parliament, freemasonry, in, the, united, states, faced, political, pressure, following, the, 1826, kidnapping, of, william, morgan, by, freemasons, and, his, subsequent, disappearance, reports, of, the, morgan, affair, together, with, opposition, to, jacksonian, democracy, andrew, jackson, was, a, prominent, mason, helped, fuel, an, anti, masonic, movement, the, short, lived, anti, masonic, party, was, formed, which, fielded, candidates, for, the, presidential, elections, of, 1828, and, 1832, in, italy, freemasonry, has, become, linked, to, a, scandal, concerning, the, propaganda, due, lodge, a, k, a, p2, this, lodge, was, chartered, by, the, grande, oriente, d, italia, in, 1877, as, a, lodge, for, visiting, masons, unable, to, attend, their, own, lodges, under, licio, gelli, s, leadership, in, the, late, 1970s, p2, became, involved, in, the, financial, scandals, that, nearly, bankrupted, the, vatican, bank, however, by, this, time, the, lodge, was, operating, independently, and, irregularly, as, the, grand, orient, had, revoked, its, charter, and, expelled, gelli, in, 1976, conspiracy, theorists, have, long, associated, freemasonry, with, the, new, world, order, and, the, illuminati, and, state, that, freemasonry, as, an, organisation, is, either, bent, on, world, domination, or, already, secretly, in, control, of, world, politics, historically, freemasonry, has, attracted, criticism, and, suppression, from, both, the, politically, far, right, e, g, nazi, germany, and, the, far, left, e, g, the, former, communist, states, in, eastern, europe, freemasonry, is, viewed, with, distrust, even, in, some, modern, democracies, in, the, uk, masons, working, in, the, justice, system, such, as, judges, and, police, officers, were, required, to, disclose, their, membership, from, 1999, to, 2009, while, a, parliamentary, inquiry, found, that, there, had, been, no, evidence, of, wrongdoing, the, government, believed, that, masons, potential, loyalties, to, support, fellow, masons, should, be, transparent, to, the, public, the, policy, of, requiring, a, declaration, of, masonic, membership, by, applicants, for, judicial, office, judges, and, magistrates, was, ended, in, 2009, by, justice, secretary, jack, straw, who, had, initiated, the, requirement, in, the, 1990s, straw, stated, that, the, rule, was, considered, disproportionate, since, no, impropriety, or, malpractice, had, been, shown, as, a, result, of, judges, being, freemasons, freemasonry, is, both, successful, and, controversial, in, france, as, of, the, early, 21st, century, membership, is, rising, but, reporting, of, it, in, popular, media, is, often, negative, in, some, countries, anti, masonry, is, often, related, to, antisemitism, and, anti, zionism, for, example, in, 1980, the, iraqi, legal, and, penal, code, was, changed, by, saddam, hussein, s, ruling, ba, ath, party, making, it, a, felony, to, promote, or, acclaim, zionist, principles, including, freemasonry, or, who, associate, with, zionist, organisations, professor, andrew, prescott, of, the, university, of, sheffield, writes, since, at, least, the, time, of, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, antisemitism, has, gone, hand, in, hand, with, anti, masonry, so, it, is, not, surprising, that, allegations, that, 11, september, was, a, zionist, plot, have, been, accompanied, by, suggestions, that, the, attacks, were, inspired, by, a, masonic, world, order, the, preserved, records, of, the, reichssicherheitshauptamt, the, reich, security, main, office, show, the, persecution, of, freemasons, during, the, holocaust, rsha, amt,

welfare, branch, of, the, nazi, party, this, coincidence, enabled, freemasons, to, wear, the, forget, me, not, badge, as, a, secret, sign, of, membership, after, world, war, ii, the, forget, me, not, flower, was, used, again, as, a, masonic, emblem, in, 1948, at, the, first, annual, convention, of, the, united, grand, lodges, of, germany, in, 1948, the, badge, is, now, sometimes, worn, in, the, coat, lapel, by, freemasons, around, the, world, to, remember, all, who, suffered, in, the, name, of, freemasonry, especially, those, during, the, nazi, era
