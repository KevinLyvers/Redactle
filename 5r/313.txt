slavic, paganism, slavic, mythology, or, slavic, religion, is, the, religious, beliefs, myths, and, ritual, practices, of, the, slavs, before, christianisation, which, occurred, at, various, stages, between, the, 8th, and, the, 13th, century, the, south, slavs, who, likely, settled, in, the, balkans, during, the, 6th, 7th, centuries, ad, bordering, with, the, byzantine, empire, to, the, south, came, under, the, sphere, of, influence, of, eastern, christianity, relatively, early, beginning, with, the, creation, of, writing, systems, for, slavic, languages, first, glagolitic, and, then, cyrillic, script, in, 855, by, the, brothers, saints, cyril, and, methodius, and, the, adoption, of, christianity, in, bulgaria, in, 864, and, 863, in, great, moravia, the, east, slavs, followed, with, the, official, adoption, in, 988, by, vladimir, the, great, of, kievan, rus, the, process, of, christianising, the, west, slavs, was, more, gradual, and, complicated, compared, to, their, eastern, counterparts, the, moravians, accepted, christianity, as, early, as, 831, the, bohemian, dukes, followed, in, 845, and, the, slovaks, accepted, christianity, somewhere, between, the, years, 828, and, 863, but, the, first, historical, polish, ruler, mieszko, i, accepted, it, much, later, in, 966, around, the, same, time, as, the, sorbs, while, the, polabian, slavs, only, came, under, the, significant, influence, of, the, catholic, church, from, the, 12th, century, onwards, for, the, polabian, slavs, and, the, sorbs, christianisation, went, hand, in, hand, with, full, or, partial, germanisation, the, christianisation, of, the, slavic, peoples, was, however, a, slow, and, in, many, cases, superficial, phenomenon, especially, in, what, is, today, russia, it, was, vigorous, in, western, and, central, parts, of, what, is, today, ukraine, since, they, were, closer, to, kiev, the, capital, of, kievan, rus, even, there, however, popular, resistance, led, by, volkhv, s, pagan, priests, or, shamans, recurred, periodically, for, centuries, popular, resistance, to, christianity, was, also, widespread, in, early, poland, culminating, in, the, pagan, reaction, the, west, slavs, of, the, baltic, tenaciously, withstood, christianity, until, it, was, violently, imposed, on, them, through, the, northern, crusades, among, poles, and, east, slavs, rebellions, broke, out, throughout, the, 11th, century, christian, chroniclers, reported, that, the, slavs, regularly, re, embraced, their, original, religion, relapsi, sunt, denuo, ad, paganismus, many, elements, of, the, slavic, indigenous, religion, were, officially, incorporated, into, slavic, christianity, which, manifested, itself, in, the, architecture, of, the, russian, church, icon, painting, etc, and, the, worship, of, slavic, gods, has, persisted, in, unofficial, folk, religion, into, modern, times, the, slavs, resistance, to, christianity, gave, rise, to, a, whimsical, syncretism, which, was, called, dvoeverie, double, faith, in, old, church, slavonic, since, the, early, 20th, century, slavic, folk, religion, has, undergone, an, organised, reinvention, and, reincorporation, in, the, movement, of, slavic, native, faith, rodnovery, one, of, the, first, written, sources, on, the, religion, of, the, ancient, slavs, is, the, description, of, the, byzantine, historian, procopius, of, caesarea, 6th, century, who, mentioned, sacrifices, to, the, supreme, god, the, thunderer, of, the, slavs, river, spirits, nymphs, and, others, these, tribes, the, slavs, and, the, antes, are, not, ruled, by, one, person, but, since, ancient, times, they, have, lived, in, the, people, s, rule, democracy, and, therefore, their, happiness, and, unhappiness, in, life, is, considered, a, common, cause, and, in, all, other, respects, both, of, these, barbarian, tribes, have, the, same, life, and, laws, they, believe, that, one, of, the, gods, the, creator, of, lightning, is, the, lord, over, all, and, bulls, are, sacrificed, to, him, and, other, sacred, rites, are, performed, they, do, not, know, fate, and, generally, do, not, recognize, that, it, has, any, power, in, relation, to, people, and, when, they, are, about, to, face, death, whether, they, are, seized, by, illness, or, in, a, dangerous, situation, in, the, war, they, promise, if, they, are, saved, to, immediately, sacrifice, to, god, for, their, soul, having, escaped, death, they, sacrifice, what, they, promised, and, they, think, that, their, salvation, has, been, bought, at, the, price, of, this, sacrifice, they, worship, rivers, and, nymphs, and, all, sorts, of, other, deities, offer, sacrifices, to, all, of, them, and, with, the, help, of, these, sacrifices, they, also, produce, divination, al, masudi, an, arab, historian, geographer, and, traveler, equates, the, paganism, of, the, slavs, and, the, rus, with, reason, there, was, a, decree, of, the, capital, of, the, khazar, khaganate, and, there, are, seven, judges, in, it, two, of, them, from, muslims, two, from, the, khazars, who, judge, according, to, the, law, of, taura, two, from, the, christians, there, who, judge, according, to, the, law, of, injil, one, of, them, from, the, slavs, russ, and, other, pagans, he, judges, according, to, the, law, of, paganism, that, is, according, to, the, law, of, reason, western, european, authors, of, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, gave, detailed, descriptions, of, the, sanctuaries, and, cults, of, redigost, radegast, svarozhich, in, rethra, svyatovit, svetovid, in, arkon, jaromarsburg, triglav, in, szczecin, chernobog, the, sanctuary, in, volyn, etc, the, identification, of, a, number, of, eastern, european, monuments, with, slavic, sanctuaries, is, a, matter, of, dispute, peryn, a, complex, near, the, site, of, the, zbruch, idol, the, main, idea, of, paganism, and, mythology, of, the, slavs, is, given, primarily, by, historical, and, documentary, sources, letopises, and, chronicles, the, tale, of, bygone, years, under, the, year, 980, contains, a, story, about, the, sanctuary, in, kiev, built, by, vladimir, svyatoslavich, and, the, idols, of, pagan, gods, installed, there, are, mentioned, and, vladimir, began, to, reign, alone, in, kiev, and, he, placed, idols, on, the, hill, outside, the, palace, perun, in, wood, with, a, silver, head, and, a, gold, moustache, and, khors, dazhdbog, and, stribog, and, simargl, and, mokosh, and, they, offered, sacrifices, and, called, them, gods, and, they, took, their, sons, and, daughters, to, them, and, sacrificed, them, to, the, devils, and, they, profaned, the, earth, with, their, sacrifices, and, rus, and, that, hill, were, profaned, by, blood, but, god, the, merciful, who, does, not, wish, the, death, of, sinners, on, that, hill, stands, today, the, church, of, saint, vasilij, as, we, will, relate, later, the, text, mentions, the, deities, svarog, yarilo, and, veles, it, is, known, that, the, idol, of, veles, stood, in, kiev, under, the, mountain, probably, on, the, kiev, podol, in, the, lower, part, of, the, city, that, is, in, the, trade, and, craft, part, of, kiev, at, the, pier, on, the, pochain, river, in, the, life, of, vladimir, it, is, said, that, this, idol, was, overthrown, during, the, baptism, of, kievan, rus, in, 988, and, veles, idol, ordered, to, throw, off, the, river, in, pochaina, ancient, russian, teachings, against, paganism, can, also, serve, as, sources, in, this, genre, three, of, the, most, famous, monuments, are, known, the, word, of, st, gregory, about, idols, the, word, of, a, certain, christ, lover, and, the, punishment, of, the, spiritual, father, about, submission, and, obedience, and, the, walking, of, the, virgin, in, torment, in, the, absence, of, original, mythological, texts, slavic, paganism, can, only, be, understood, through, secondary, sources, such, as, archaeological, findings, and, non, slavic, historical, texts, which, then, have, to, be, analyzed, via, the, comparative, method, and, subsequent, reconstruction, a, means, used, by, many, historians, including, evgeny, anichkov, dmitry, zelenin, lubor, niederle, henryk, owmia, ski, aleksander, gieysztor, stanis, aw, urba, czyk, and, others, reconstruction, however, only, gained, momentum, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, with, slavic, sources, being, compared, to, sources, on, other, indo, european, cultural, traditions, baltic, iranian, german, etc, where, the, works, of, vechaslav, ivanov, and, vladimir, toporov, are, among, the, most, prominent, the, richest, sources, for, the, study, of, slavic, paganism, as, a, cultural, model, and, the, reconstruction, of, ancient, slavic, ideas, remain, the, linguistic, ethnographic, and, folklore, studies, of, slavic, traditions, from, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, although, some, of, these, studies, are, contested, due, to, historical, inaccuracies, many, traces, of, slavic, paganism, are, thought, to, be, left, in, european, toponymy, including, the, names, of, settlements, rivers, mountains, and, villages, but, ethnologists, such, as, vitomir, belaj, warn, against, hasty, assumptions, that, the, toponyms, truly, originate, in, pre, christian, mythological, beliefs, with, some, potentially, being, derived, from, common, vocabulary, instead, twentieth, century, scholars, who, pursued, the, study, of, ancient, slavic, religion, include, vyacheslav, ivanov, vladimir, toporov, marija, gimbutas, boris, rybakov, and, roman, jakobson, among, others, rybakov, is, noted, for, his, effort, to, re, examine, medieval, ecclesiastical, texts, synthesizing, his, findings, with, archaeological, data, comparative, mythology, ethnography, and, nineteenth, century, folk, practices, he, also, elaborated, one, of, the, most, coherent, pictures, of, ancient, slavic, religion, in, his, paganism, of, the, ancient, slavs, and, other, works, among, earlier, nineteenth, century, scholars, there, was, bernhard, severin, ingemann, known, for, his, study, of, fundamentals, of, a, north, slavic, and, wendish, mythology, historical, documents, about, slavic, religion, include, the, primary, chronicle, compiled, in, kiev, around, 1111, and, the, novgorod, first, chronicle, compiled, in, the, novgorod, republic, they, contain, detailed, reports, of, the, annihilation, of, the, official, slavic, religion, of, kiev, and, novgorod, and, the, subsequent, double, faith, the, primary, chronicle, also, contains, the, authentic, text, of, rus, greek, treatises, dated, 945, and, 971, with, native, pre, christian, oaths, from, the, eleventh, century, onwards, various, rus, writings, were, produced, against, the, survival, of, slavic, religion, and, slavic, gods, were, interpolated, in, the, translations, of, foreign, literary, works, such, as, the, malalas, chronicle, and, the, alexandreis, the, west, slavs, who, dwelt, in, the, area, between, the, vistula, and, the, elbe, stubbornly, resisted, the, northern, crusades, and, the, history, of, their, resistance, is, written, down, in, the, eleventh, and, twelfth, century, latin, chronicles, by, thietmar, of, merseburg, adam, of, bremen, and, helmold, three, german, clergymen, as, well, as, in, the, twelfth, century, biographies, of, otto, of, bamberg, and, in, saxo, grammaticus, thirteenth, century, gesta, danorum, these, documents, together, with, minor, german, writings, and, the, icelandic, kn, tlinga, saga, provide, a, detailed, description, of, northwestern, slavic, religion, the, religions, of, other, slavic, populations, are, less, well, documented, as, texts, about, them, such, as, the, fifteenth, century, polish, chronicle, were, only, produced, later, after, christianisation, and, contain, a, lot, of, sheer, inventions, in, the, times, preceding, christianisation, however, some, greek, and, roman, chroniclers, such, as, procopius, and, jordanes, in, the, sixth, century, sparsely, documented, some, slavic, concepts, and, practices, the, linguistic, unity, and, negligible, dialectal, differentiation, of, the, slavs, until, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, ad, as, well, as, the, lexical, uniformity, of, religious, vocabulary, witness, a, uniformity, of, early, slavic, religion, it, has, been, argued, that, the, essence, of, early, slavdom, was, ethnoreligious, before, being, ethnonational, that, is, to, say, belonging, to, the, slavs, was, chiefly, determined, by, conforming, to, certain, beliefs, and, practices, rather, than, by, having, a, certain, racial, ancestry, or, being, born, in, a, certain, place, ivanov, and, toporov, identified, the, slavic, religion, as, an, outgrowth, of, a, purported, common, proto, indo, european, religion, sharing, strong, similarities, with, other, neighbouring, belief, systems, such, as, those, of, the, balts, thracians, and, phrygians, local, development, of, the, ancient, slavic, religion, especially, in, places, like, russia, likely, also, included, several, influences, from, the, neighbouring, finnic, peoples, which, contributed, to, local, ethnogenesis, slavic, and, baltic, religion, and, mythology, is, considered, more, conservative, and, closer, to, the, purported, original, proto, indo, european, religion, than, other, indo, european, derived, traditions, due, to, the, fact, that, throughout, the, history, of, the, slavs, it, remained, a, popular, religion, rather, than, being, reworked, and, sophisticated, by, intellectual, elites, as, had, happened, to, other, indo, european, derived, religious, cultures, for, this, reason, slavic, religion, is, invaluable, for, understanding, other, indo, european, beliefs, the, affinity, to, proto, indo, iranian, religion, is, evident, in, shared, developments, including, the, elimination, of, the, term, for, the, supreme, god, of, heaven, dyeus, and, its, substitution, by, the, term, for, sky, slavic, nebo, the, shift, of, the, indo, european, descriptor, of, heavenly, deities, avestan, daeva, old, church, slavonic, div, proto, indo, european, deiwos, celestial, similar, to, dyeus, to, the, designation, of, evil, entities, and, the, parallel, designation, of, gods, by, the, term, meaning, both, wealth, and, its, giver, avestan, baga, slavic, bog, much, of, the, religious, vocabulary, of, the, slavs, including, vera, loosely, translated, as, faith, meaning, radiation, of, knowledge, svet, light, mir, peace, agreement, of, parts, also, meaning, world, and, rai, paradise, is, shared, with, iranian, according, to, adrian, ivakhiv, the, indo, european, element, of, slavic, religion, may, have, included, what, georges, dum, zil, studied, as, the, trifunctional, hypothesis, that, is, to, say, a, threefold, conception, of, the, social, order, represented, by, the, three, castes, of, priests, warriors, and, farmers, according, to, marija, gimbutas, slavic, religion, represented, an, unmistakable, overlap, of, any, purported, indo, european, originated, themes, with, ancient, religious, themes, dating, back, to, time, immemorial, the, latter, were, particularly, hardwearing, in, slavic, religion, represented, by, the, widespread, devotion, to, mat, syra, zemlya, the, damp, mother, earth, rybakov, said, the, continuity, and, gradual, complexification, of, slavic, religion, started, from, devotion, to, life, giving, forces, bereginy, ancestors, and, the, supreme, god, rod, generation, itself, and, developed, into, the, high, mythology, of, the, official, religion, of, the, early, kievan, rus, as, attested, by, helmold, c, 1120, 1177, in, his, chronica, slavorum, the, slavs, believed, in, a, single, heavenly, god, begetting, all, the, lesser, spirits, governing, nature, and, worshipped, it, by, their, means, according, to, helmold, obeying, the, duties, assigned, to, them, have, sprung, from, his, blood, and, enjoy, distinction, in, proportion, to, their, nearness, to, the, god, of, the, gods, according, to, rybakov, s, studies, wheel, symbols, such, as, the, thunder, marks, gromovoi, znak, and, the, six, petaled, rose, inside, a, circle, e, g, which, are, quite, common, in, slavic, folk, crafts, and, which, were, still, carved, on, edges, and, peaks, of, roofs, in, northern, russia, in, the, nineteenth, century, were, symbols, of, the, supreme, life, giver, rod, before, its, conceptualisation, as, rod, rybakov, claims, this, supreme, god, was, known, as, deivos, cognate, with, sanskrit, deva, latin, deus, old, high, german, ziu, and, lithuanian, dievas, the, slavs, believed, that, from, this, god, was, preceded, by, a, cosmic, duality, represented, by, belobog, white, god, and, chernobog, black, god, also, named, tiarnoglofi, black, head, mind, representing, the, root, of, all, the, heavenly, masculine, and, the, earthly, feminine, deities, or, the, waxing, light, and, waning, light, gods, respectively, in, both, categories, deities, might, be, either, razi, rede, givers, or, zirnitra, wizards, the, slavs, perceived, the, world, as, inhabited, by, a, variety, of, spirits, which, they, represented, as, persons, and, worshipped, these, spirits, included, those, of, waters, mavka, and, rusalka, forests, lisovyk, fields, polyovyk, those, of, households, domovoy, those, of, illnesses, luck, and, human, ancestors, for, instance, leshy, is, an, important, woodland, spirit, believed, to, distribute, food, assigning, preys, to, hunters, later, regarded, as, a, god, of, flocks, and, herds, and, still, worshipped, in, this, function, in, early, twentieth, century, russia, many, gods, were, regarded, as, the, ancestors, of, individual, kins, rod, or, pleme, and, the, idea, of, ancestrality, was, so, important, that, slavic, religion, may, be, epitomised, as, a, manism, i, e, worship, of, ancestors, though, the, slavs, did, not, keep, genealogical, records, the, slavs, also, worshipped, star, gods, including, the, moon, russian, mesyats, and, the, sun, solntse, the, former, regarded, as, male, and, the, latter, as, female, the, moon, god, was, particularly, important, regarded, as, the, dispenser, of, abundance, and, health, worshipped, through, round, dances, and, in, some, traditions, considered, the, progenitor, of, humanity, the, belief, in, the, moon, god, was, still, very, much, alive, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, peasants, in, the, ukrainian, carpathians, openly, affirmed, that, the, moon, is, their, god, some, slavic, deities, are, related, to, baltic, mythology, perun, perk, nas, veles, velnias, rod, dievas, yarilo, saul, there, was, an, evident, continuity, between, the, beliefs, of, the, east, slavs, west, slavs, and, south, slavs, they, shared, the, same, traditional, deities, as, attested, for, instance, by, the, worship, of, zuarasiz, among, the, west, slavs, corresponding, to, svaro, i, among, the, east, slavs, all, the, bright, male, deities, were, regarded, as, the, hypostases, forms, or, phases, in, the, year, of, the, active, and, masculine, divine, force, personified, by, perun, thunder, perun, s, name, from, the, indo, european, root, per, or, perk, w, to, strike, splinter, signified, both, the, splintering, thunder, and, the, splintered, tree, especially, the, oak, the, latin, name, of, this, tree, quercus, comes, from, the, same, root, regarded, as, symbols, of, the, irradiation, of, the, force, this, root, also, gave, rise, to, the, vedic, parjanya, the, baltic, perk, nas, the, albanian, per, ndi, now, denoting, god, and, sky, the, germanic, fj, rgynn, and, the, greek, keraun, s, thunderbolt, rhymic, form, of, peraun, s, used, as, an, epithet, of, zeus, from, the, exact, same, root, comes, the, name, of, the, finnish, deity, ukko, which, has, a, balto, slavic, origin, pr, gyni, or, peregyni, despite, being, rendered, as, bregynja, or, beregynja, from, breg, bereg, meaning, shore, and, reinterpreted, as, female, water, spirits, in, modern, russian, folklore, were, rather, spirits, of, trees, and, rivers, related, to, perun, as, attested, by, various, chronicles, and, highlighted, by, the, root, per, slavic, traditions, preserved, very, ancient, elements, and, intermingled, with, those, of, neighbouring, european, peoples, an, exemplary, case, are, the, south, slavic, still, living, rain, rituals, of, the, couple, perun, perperuna, lord, and, lady, thunder, shared, with, the, neighbouring, albanians, greeks, and, arumanians, the, west, slavs, especially, those, of, the, baltic, prominently, worshipped, svetovid, lord, of, power, while, the, east, slavs, prominently, worshipped, perun, himself, especially, after, vladimir, s, 970s, 980s, reforms, the, various, spirits, were, believed, to, manifest, in, certain, places, which, were, revered, as, numinous, and, holy, they, included, springs, rivers, groves, rounded, tops, of, hills, and, flat, cliffs, overlooking, rivers, calendrical, rituals, were, attuned, with, the, spirits, which, were, believed, to, have, periods, of, waxing, and, waning, throughout, the, year, determining, the, agrarian, fertility, cycle, the, cosmology, of, ancient, slavic, religion, which, is, preserved, in, contemporary, slavic, folk, religion, is, visualised, as, a, three, tiered, vertical, structure, or, world, tree, as, is, common, in, other, indo, european, religions, at, the, top, there, is, the, heavenly, plane, symbolised, by, birds, the, sun, and, the, moon, the, middle, plane, is, that, of, earthly, humanity, symbolised, by, bees, and, men, at, the, bottom, of, the, structure, there, is, the, netherworld, symbolised, by, snakes, and, beavers, and, by, the, chthonic, god, veles, the, zbruch, idol, found, in, western, ukraine, which, was, at, first, identified, as, a, representation, of, svetovid, represents, this, theo, cosmology, the, three, layered, effigy, of, the, four, major, deities, perun, dazhbog, mokosh, and, lada, is, constituted, by, a, top, level, with, four, figures, representing, them, facing, the, four, cardinal, directions, a, middle, level, with, representations, of, a, human, ritual, community, khorovod, and, a, bottom, level, with, the, representation, of, a, three, headed, chthonic, god, veles, who, sustains, the, entire, structure, the, scholar, ji, dynda, studied, the, figure, of, triglav, literally, the, three, headed, one, and, svetovid, which, are, widely, attested, in, archaeological, testimonies, as, the, respectively, three, headed, and, four, headed, representations, of, the, same, axis, mundi, of, the, same, supreme, god, triglav, itself, was, connected, to, the, symbols, of, the, tree, and, the, mountain, which, are, other, common, symbols, of, the, axis, mundi, and, in, this, quality, he, was, a, summus, deus, a, sum, of, all, things, as, recorded, by, ebbo, c, 775, 851, triglav, represents, the, vertical, interconnection, of, the, three, worlds, reflected, by, the, three, social, functions, studied, by, dum, zil, sacerdotal, martial, and, economic, ebbo, himself, documented, that, the, triglav, was, seen, as, embodying, the, connection, and, mediation, between, heaven, earth, and, the, underworld, adam, of, bremen, c, 1040s, 1080s, described, the, triglav, of, wolin, as, neptunus, triplicis, naturae, that, is, to, say, neptune, of, the, three, natures, generations, attesting, the, colours, that, were, attributed, to, the, three, worlds, also, studied, by, karel, jarom, r, erben, 1811, 1870, white, for, heaven, green, for, earth, and, black, for, the, underworld, it, also, represents, the, three, dimensions, of, time, mythologically, rendered, in, the, figure, of, a, three, threaded, rope, triglav, is, perun, in, the, heavenly, plane, svetovid, in, the, centre, from, which, the, horizontal, four, directions, unfold, and, veles, the, psychopomp, in, the, underworld, svetovid, is, interpreted, by, dynda, as, the, incarnation, of, the, axis, mundi, in, the, four, dimensions, of, space, helmold, defined, svetovid, as, deus, deorum, god, of, all, gods, alongside, triglav, and, svetovid, other, deities, were, also, represented, with, many, heads, this, is, attested, by, chroniclers, who, wrote, about, west, slavs, including, saxo, grammaticus, c, 1160, 1220, according, to, him, rugievit, in, charenza, was, represented, with, seven, faces, which, converged, at, the, top, in, a, single, crown, these, three, four, or, many, headed, images, wooden, or, carved, in, stone, some, covered, in, metal, which, held, drinking, horns, and, were, decorated, with, solar, symbols, and, horses, were, kept, in, temples, of, which, numerous, archaeological, remains, have, been, found, they, were, built, on, upraised, platforms, frequently, on, hills, but, also, at, the, confluences, of, rivers, the, biographers, of, otto, of, bamberg, 1060, 1061, 1139, inform, that, these, temples, were, known, as, continae, dwellings, among, west, slavs, testifying, that, they, were, regarded, as, the, houses, of, the, gods, they, were, wooden, buildings, with, an, inner, cell, with, the, god, s, statue, located, in, wider, walled, enclosures, or, fortifications, such, fortifications, might, contain, up, to, four, continae, different, continae, were, owned, by, different, kins, and, used, for, the, ritual, banquets, in, honour, of, their, own, ancestor, gods, these,

glorification, in, serbia, sobor, assembly, and, kurban, sacrifice, in, bulgaria, with, christianisation, the, ancestor, gods, were, replaced, with, christian, patron, saints, there, also, existed, holy, places, with, no, buildings, where, the, deity, was, believed, to, manifest, in, nature, itself, such, locations, were, characterised, by, the, combined, presence, of, trees, and, springs, according, to, the, description, of, one, such, sites, in, szczecin, by, otto, of, bamberg, a, shrine, of, the, same, type, in, kobarid, contemporary, slovenia, was, stamped, out, in, a, crusade, as, recently, as, 1331, usually, common, people, were, not, allowed, into, the, presence, of, the, images, of, their, gods, the, sight, of, which, was, a, privilege, of, the, priests, many, of, these, images, were, seen, and, described, only, in, the, moment, of, their, violent, destruction, at, the, hands, of, the, christian, missionaries, the, priests, volkhv, s, who, kept, the, temples, and, led, rituals, and, festivals, enjoyed, a, great, degree, of, prestige, they, received, tributes, and, shares, of, military, booties, by, the, kins, chiefs, some, of, the, stone, idols, of, the, northeastern, slavs, looked, like, mushrooms, without, a, face, and, with, a, clearly, distinguished, hat, moreover, such, idols, were, made, by, hand, through, turning, a, boulder, upside, down, and, giving, it, the, shape, of, a, mushroom, the, medieval, manuscript, of, the, 11th, 14th, centuries, the, word, of, st, gregory, invented, in, toltsekh, contains, a, direct, indication, that, the, slavs, worshiped, such, phallic, idols, according, to, some, researchers, such, idols, were, dedicated, to, rod, or, veles, according, to, local, old, folklore, stone, mushrooms, are, dedicated, to, veles, due, to, the, fact, that, these, idols, had, no, face, they, were, not, destroyed, according, to, the, beliefs, of, the, local, population, such, stone, idols, had, healing, properties, so, they, were, regularly, visited, on, certain, days, people, brought, gifts, to, them, and, in, order, to, receive, healing, from, an, illness, they, had, to, sit, on, an, idol, the, stone, mushroom, was, respected, and, protected, disrespectful, attitude, towards, this, idol, was, not, allowed, the, keepers, of, traditions, and, rituals, performed, around, the, idol, were, elderly, women, and, the, tradition, was, passed, down, through, generations, there, are, also, beliefs, that, such, stone, mushrooms, provided, fertility, for, the, soil, and, people, therefore, in, some, places, the, worship, of, these, idols, persisted, for, centuries, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, and, even, after, being, transferred, to, a, museum, elements, of, the, rituals, are, still, performed, the, dating, of, stone, mushrooms, is, only, approximate, most, dating, back, to, about, 1000, ad, the, stone, mushroom, idols, are, very, similar, to, two, slavic, stone, idols, from, the, northeastern, regions, sheksna, idol, in, novgorod, museum, novgorod, region, russia, and, sebej, idol, sebej, museum, pskov, region, russia, these, slavic, idols, have, a, face, and, a, phallic, shape, their, characteristic, feature, is, a, hat, an, ancient, slavic, stone, idol, was, discovered, on, the, territory, of, the, nikolo, babaevsky, monastery, nekrasovsky, district, in, 2020, an, ancient, pagan, place, that, existed, before, the, monastery, and, churches, is, mentioned, in, the, ethnographic, materials, of, bogdanovich, in, that, place, on, babayki, the, idol, of, the, supreme, heavenly, god, was, worshiped, the, discovered, babaevsky, idol, has, a, clear, shape, of, a, large, mushroom, completely, carved, from, a, boulder, it, is, very, similar, to, mushroom, idols, from, the, local, cities, of, ples, and, myshkin, based, on, morphological, details, the, multifaceted, cult, function, of, this, idol, is, assumed, fertility, not, only, for, the, land, and, forest, but, also, fertility, for, humans, a, form, of, the, ancient, slavic, polytheistic, religion, was, practised, by, the, south, slavs, including, the, croats, and, serbs, prior, to, christianisation, they, came, into, contact, with, christianity, during, the, reign, of, emperor, heraclius, 610, 641, continued, by, rome, and, baptization, process, ended, during, the, rule, of, basil, i, 867, 886, by, byzantine, missionaries, of, constantinople, cyril, and, methodius, in, 980, ce, in, kievan, rus, led, by, the, great, prince, vladimir, there, was, an, attempt, to, unify, the, various, beliefs, and, priestly, practices, of, slavic, religion, in, order, to, bind, together, the, slavic, peoples, in, the, growing, centralised, state, vladimir, canonised, a, number, of, deities, to, whom, he, erected, a, temple, on, the, hills, of, the, capital, kiev, these, deities, recorded, in, the, primary, chronicle, were, five, perun, xors, dazhbog, stribog, simargl, and, mokosh, various, other, deities, were, worshipped, by, the, common, people, notably, veles, who, had, a, temple, in, the, merchant, s, district, of, podil, of, the, capital, itself, according, to, scholars, vladimir, s, project, consisted, of, a, number, of, reforms, that, he, had, already, started, by, the, 970s, and, which, were, aimed, at, preserving, the, traditions, of, the, kins, and, making, kiev, the, spiritual, centre, of, east, slavdom, perun, was, the, god, of, thunder, law, and, war, symbolised, by, the, oak, and, the, mallet, or, throwing, stones, and, identified, with, the, baltic, perkunas, the, germanic, thor, and, the, vedic, indra, among, others, his, cult, was, practised, not, so, much, by, commoners, but, mainly, by, the, aristocracy, veles, was, the, god, of, horned, livestock, skotibog, of, wealth, and, of, the, underworld, perun, and, veles, symbolised, an, oppositional, and, yet, complementary, duality, similar, to, that, of, the, vedic, mitra, and, varuna, an, eternal, struggle, between, heavenly, and, chthonic, forces, roman, jakobson, himself, identified, veles, as, the, vedic, varuna, god, of, oaths, and, of, the, world, order, this, belief, in, a, cosmic, duality, was, likely, the, reason, that, led, to, the, exclusion, of, veles, from, vladimir, s, official, temple, in, kiev, xors, dazhbog, radiant, giving, god, was, the, god, of, the, life, bringing, power, of, the, sun, stribog, was, identified, by, e, g, kagarov, as, the, god, of, wind, storm, and, dissension, mokosh, the, only, female, deity, in, vladimir, s, pantheon, is, interpreted, as, meaning, the, wet, or, moist, by, jakobson, identifying, her, with, the, mat, syra, zemlya, damp, mother, earth, of, later, folk, religion, according, to, ivanits, written, sources, from, the, middle, ages, leave, no, doubt, whatsoever, that, the, common, slavic, peoples, continued, to, worship, their, indigenous, deities, and, hold, their, rituals, for, centuries, after, kievan, rus, official, baptism, into, christianity, and, the, lower, clergy, of, the, newly, formed, orthodox, christian, church, often, joined, the, celebrations, the, high, clergy, repeatedly, condemned, through, official, admonitions, the, worship, of, rod, and, the, rozhanitsy, god, and, the, goddesses, or, generation, and, the, generatrixes, with, offerings, of, bread, porridge, cheese, and, mead, scholars, of, russian, religion, define, rod, as, the, general, power, of, birth, and, reproduction, and, the, rozhanitsy, as, the, mistresses, of, individual, destiny, kagarov, identified, the, later, domovoi, the, god, of, the, household, and, kinship, ancestry, as, a, specific, manifestation, of, rod, other, gods, attested, in, medieval, documents, remain, largely, mysterious, for, instance, lada, and, her, sons, lel, and, polel, who, are, often, identified, by, scholars, with, the, greek, gods, leda, or, leto, and, her, twin, sons, castor, and, pollux, other, figures, who, in, medieval, documents, are, often, presented, as, deities, such, as, kupala, and, koliada, were, rather, the, personifications, of, the, spirits, of, agrarian, holidays, in, 988, vladimir, of, kievan, rus, rejected, slavic, religion, and, he, and, his, subjects, were, officially, baptised, into, the, eastern, orthodox, church, then, the, state, religion, of, the, byzantine, empire, according, to, legend, vladimir, sent, delegates, to, foreign, states, to, determine, what, was, the, most, convincing, religion, to, be, adopted, by, kiev, joyfulness, and, beauty, were, the, primary, characteristics, of, pre, christian, slavic, ceremonies, and, the, delegates, sought, something, capable, of, matching, these, qualities, they, were, crestfallen, by, the, islamic, religion, of, volga, bulgaria, where, they, found, no, joy, but, sorrow, and, great, stench, and, by, western, christianity, then, the, catholic, church, where, they, found, many, worship, services, but, nowhere, beauty, those, who, visited, constantinople, were, instead, impressed, by, the, arts, and, rituals, of, byzantine, christianity, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, after, the, choice, was, made, vladimir, commanded, that, the, slavic, temple, on, the, kiev, hills, be, destroyed, and, the, effigies, of, the, gods, be, burned, or, thrown, into, the, dnieper, slavic, temples, were, destroyed, throughout, the, lands, of, kievan, rus, and, christian, churches, were, built, in, their, places, according, to, ivakhiv, christianisation, was, stronger, in, what, is, today, western, and, central, ukraine, lands, close, to, the, capital, kiev, slavic, religion, persisted, however, especially, in, northernmost, regions, of, slavic, settlement, in, what, is, today, the, central, part, of, european, russia, such, as, the, areas, of, novgorod, suzdal, and, belozersk, in, the, core, regions, of, christianisation, themselves, the, common, population, remained, attached, to, the, volkhv, s, the, priests, who, periodically, over, centuries, led, popular, rebellions, against, the, central, power, and, the, christian, church, christianisation, was, a, very, slow, process, among, the, slavs, and, the, official, christian, church, adopted, a, policy, of, co, opting, pre, christian, elements, into, slavic, christianity, christian, saints, were, identified, with, slavic, gods, for, instance, the, figure, of, perun, was, overlapped, with, that, of, saint, elias, veles, was, identified, with, saint, blasius, and, yarilo, became, saint, george, and, christian, festivals, were, set, on, the, same, dates, as, pagan, ones, another, feature, of, early, slavic, christianity, was, the, strong, influence, of, apocryphal, literature, which, became, evident, by, the, thirteenth, century, with, the, rise, of, bogomilism, among, the, south, slavs, south, slavic, bogomilism, produced, a, large, amount, of, apocryphal, texts, and, their, teachings, later, penetrated, into, russia, and, would, have, influenced, later, slavic, folk, religion, bernshtam, tells, of, a, flood, of, apocryphal, literature, in, eleventh, to, fifteenth, century, russia, which, might, not, have, been, controlled, by, the, still, weak, russian, orthodox, church, some, scholars, have, highlighted, how, the, conversion, of, rus, took, place, no, more, than, eight, years, after, vladimir, s, reform, of, slavic, religion, in, 980, according, to, them, christianity, in, general, did, not, have, any, deep, influence, in, the, formation, of, the, ideology, culture, and, social, psychology, of, archaic, societies, and, the, introduction, of, christianity, in, kiev, did, not, bring, about, a, radical, change, in, the, consciousness, of, the, society, during, the, entire, course, of, early, russian, history, it, was, portrayed, as, a, mass, and, conscious, conversion, only, by, half, a, century, later, by, the, scribes, of, the, christian, establishment, according, to, some, scholars, the, replacement, of, slavic, temples, with, christian, churches, and, the, baptism, of, rus, has, to, be, understood, in, continuity, with, the, foregoing, chain, of, reforms, of, slavic, religion, launched, by, vladimir, rather, than, as, a, breaking, point, v, g, vlasov, quotes, the, respected, scholar, of, slavic, religion, e, v, anichkov, who, regarding, russia, s, christianisation, said, christianization, of, the, countryside, was, the, work, not, of, the, eleventh, and, twelfth, but, of, the, fifteenth, and, sixteenth, or, even, seventeenth, century, according, to, vlasov, the, ritual, of, baptism, and, mass, conversion, undergone, by, vladimir, in, 988, was, never, repeated, in, the, centuries, to, follow, and, mastery, of, christian, teachings, was, never, accomplished, on, the, popular, level, even, by, the, start, of, the, twentieth, century, according, to, him, a, nominal, superficial, identification, with, christianity, was, possible, with, the, superimposition, of, a, christianised, agrarian, calendar, christmas, easter, whitsunday, over, the, indigenous, complex, of, festivals, koliada, yarilo, kupala, the, analysis, of, the, christianised, agrarian, and, ritual, calendar, combined, with, data, from, popular, astronomy, leads, to, determine, that, the, julian, calendar, associated, with, the, orthodox, church, was, adopted, by, russian, peasants, between, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, century, it, was, by, this, period, that, much, of, the, russian, population, became, officially, part, of, the, orthodox, church, and, therefore, nominally, christians, this, occurred, as, an, effect, of, a, broader, complex, of, phenomena, which, russia, underwent, by, the, fifteenth, century, that, is, to, say, radical, changes, towards, a, centralisation, of, state, power, which, involved, urbanisation, bureaucratisation, and, the, consolidation, of, serfdom, of, the, peasantry, that, the, vast, majority, of, the, russian, population, was, not, christian, back, in, the, fifteenth, century, may, possibly, be, evidenced, by, archaeology, according, to, vlasov, mound, kurgan, burials, which, do, not, reflect, christian, norms, were, a, universal, phenomenon, in, russia, up, to, the, fifteenth, century, and, persisted, into, the, 1530s, moreover, chronicles, from, that, period, such, as, the, pskov, chronicle, and, archaeological, data, collected, by, n, m, nikolsky, testify, that, back, in, the, fifteenth, century, there, were, still, no, rural, churches, for, the, general, use, of, the, populace, churches, existed, only, at, the, courts, of, boyars, and, princes, it, was, only, by, the, sixteenth, century, that, the, russian, orthodox, church, grew, as, a, powerful, centralising, institution, taking, the, catholic, church, of, rome, as, a, model, and, the, distinctiveness, of, a, slavic, folk, religion, became, evident, the, church, condemned, heresies, and, tried, to, eradicate, the, false, half, pagan, folk, religion, of, the, common, people, but, these, measures, coming, from, the, centres, of, church, power, were, largely, ineffective, and, on, the, local, level, creative, syntheses, of, folk, religious, rituals, and, holidays, continued, to, thrive, when, the, incorporation, of, the, russian, population, into, christianity, became, substantial, in, the, middle, of, the, sixteenth, century, the, russian, orthodox, church, absorbed, further, elements, of, pre, christian, and, popular, tradition, and, underwent, a, transformation, of, its, architecture, with, the, adoption, of, the, hipped, roof, which, was, traditionally, associated, with, pre, christian, slavic, temples, the, most, significant, change, however, was, the, adoption, of, the, sunwise, or, clockwise, direction, in, christian, ritual, procession, christianity, is, characterised, by, withershins, ritual, movement, that, is, to, say, movement, against, the, course, of, the, sun, this, was, also, the, case, in, slavic, christianity, before, the, sixteenth, century, sunwise, movements, are, instead, characteristic, of, slavic, religion, evident, in, the, khorovod, ritual, circle, dance, which, magically, favours, the, development, of, things, withershins, movement, was, employed, in, popular, rituals, too, though, only, in, those, occasions, when, it, was, considered, worthwhile, to, act, against, the, course, of, nature, in, order, to, alter, the, state, of, affairs, when, patriarch, nikon, of, moscow, launched, his, reform, of, the, orthodox, church, in, 1656, he, restored, the, withershins, ritual, movement, this, was, among, the, changes, that, led, to, a, schism, raskol, within, russian, orthodoxy, between, those, who, accepted, the, reforms, and, the, old, believers, who, preserved, instead, the, ancient, piety, derived, from, indigenous, slavic, religion, a, large, number, of, russians, and, ethnic, minorities, converted, to, the, movement, of, the, old, believers, in, the, broadest, meaning, of, the, term, including, a, variety, of, folk, religions, pointed, out, by, bernshtam, and, these, old, believers, were, a, significant, part, of, the, settlers, of, broader, european, russia, and, siberia, throughout, the, second, half, of, the, seventeenth, century, which, saw, the, expansion, of, the, russian, state, in, these, regions, old, believers, were, distinguished, by, their, cohesion, literacy, and, initiative, and, constantly, emerging, new, religious, sects, tended, to, identify, themselves, with, the, movement, this, posed, a, great, hitch, to, the, russian, orthodox, church, s, project, of, thorough, christianisation, of, the, masses, veletskaya, highlighted, how, the, old, believers, have, preserved, early, slavic, pagan, ideas, and, practices, such, as, the, veneration, of, fire, as, a, channel, to, the, divine, world, the, symbolism, of, the, colour, red, the, search, for, a, glorious, death, and, more, in, general, the, holistic, vision, of, a, divine, cosmos, in, the, opinion, of, norman, davies, the, christianisation, of, poland, through, the, czech, polish, alliance, represented, a, conscious, choice, on, the, part, of, polish, rulers, to, ally, themselves, with, the, czech, state, rather, than, the, german, one, the, moravian, cultural, influence, played, a, significant, role, in, the, spread, of, christianity, onto, the, polish, lands, and, the, subsequent, adoption, of, that, religion, christianity, arrived, around, the, late, 9th, century, most, likely, around, the, time, when, the, vistulan, tribe, encountered, the, christian, rite, in, dealings, with, their, neighbours, the, great, moravia, bohemian, state, the, baptism, of, poland, refers, to, the, ceremony, when, the, first, ruler, of, the, polish, state, mieszko, i, and, much, of, his, court, converted, to, christianity, on, the, holy, saturday, of, 14, april, 966, in, the, eleventh, century, slavic, pagan, culture, was, still, in, full, working, order, among, the, west, slavs, christianity, faced, popular, opposition, including, an, uprising, in, the, 1030s, particularly, intense, in, the, years, of, 1035, 1037, by, the, twelfth, century, however, under, the, pressure, of, germanisation, catholicism, was, forcefully, imposed, through, the, northern, crusades, and, temples, and, images, of, slavic, religion, were, violently, destroyed, west, slavic, populations, held, out, vigorously, against, christianisation, one, of, the, most, famous, instances, of, popular, resistance, occurred, at, the, temple, stronghold, of, svetovid, at, cape, arkona, in, rugia, the, temple, at, arkona, had, a, squared, groundplan, with, an, inner, hall, sustained, by, four, pillars, which, contained, svetovid, s, statue, the, latter, had, four, heads, shown, beardless, and, cleanshaven, after, the, rugian, fashion, in, its, right, hand, the, statue, held, a, horn, of, precious, metal, which, was, used, for, divination, during, the, yearly, great, festival, of, the, god, in, 1168, arkona, surrendered, to, the, danish, troops, of, king, valdemar, i, and, the, bishop, absalon, led, the, destruction, of, the, temple, of, svetovid, ethnography, in, late, nineteenth, century, ukraine, documented, a, thorough, synthesis, of, pagan, and, christian, elements, in, slavic, folk, religion, a, system, often, called, double, belief, russian, dvoeverie, ukrainian, dvovirya, according, to, bernshtam, dvoeverie, is, still, used, to, this, day, in, scholarly, works, to, define, slavic, folk, religion, which, is, seen, by, certain, scholars, as, having, preserved, much, of, pre, christian, slavic, religion, poorly, and, transparently, covered, by, a, christianity, that, may, be, easily, stripped, away, to, reveal, more, or, less, pure, patterns, of, the, original, faith, since, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, there, has, been, a, new, wave, of, scholarly, debate, on, the, subjects, of, slavic, folk, religion, and, dvoeverie, a, e, musin, an, academic, and, deacon, of, the, russian, orthodox, church, published, an, article, about, the, problem, of, double, belief, as, recently, as, 1991, in, this, article, he, divides, scholars, between, those, who, say, that, russian, orthodoxy, adapted, to, entrenched, indigenous, faith, continuing, the, soviet, idea, of, an, undefeated, paganism, and, those, who, say, that, russian, orthodoxy, is, an, out, and, out, syncretic, religion, bernshtam, challenges, dualistic, notions, of, dvoeverie, and, proposes, interpreting, broader, slavic, religiosity, as, a, mnogoverie, multifaith, continuum, in, which, a, higher, layer, of, orthodox, christian, officialdom, is, alternated, with, a, variety, of, old, beliefs, among, the, various, strata, of, the, population, according, to, ivanits, nineteenth, and, twentieth, century, slavic, folk, religion, s, central, concern, was, fertility, propitiated, with, rites, celebrating, death, and, resurrection, scholars, of, slavic, religion, who, focused, on, nineteenth, century, folk, religion, were, often, led, to, mistakes, such, as, the, interpretation, of, rod, and, rozhanitsy, as, figures, of, a, merely, ancestral, cult, however, in, medieval, documents, rod, is, equated, with, the, ancient, egyptian, god, osiris, representing, a, broader, concept, of, natural, generativity, belief, in, the, holiness, of, mat, syra, zemlya, damp, mother, earth, is, another, feature, that, has, persisted, into, modern, slavic, folk, religion, up, to, the, twentieth, century, russian, peasants, practiced, a, variety, of, rituals, devoted, to, her, and, confessed, their, sins, to, her, in, the, absence, of, a, priest, ivanits, also, reports, that, in, the, region, of, vladimir, old, people, practiced, a, ritual, asking, earth, s, forgiveness, before, their, death, a, number, of, scholars, attributed, the, russians, particular, devotion, to, the, theotokos, the, mother, of, god, to, this, still, powerful, pre, christian, substratum, of, devotion, to, a, great, mother, goddess, ivanits, attributes, the, tenacity, of, synthetic, slavic, folk, religion, to, an, exceptionality, of, slavs, and, of, russia, in, particular, compared, to, other, european, countries, the, russian, case, is, extreme, she, says, because, russia, especially, the, vastness, of, rural, russia, neither, lived, the, intellectual, upheavals, of, the, renaissance, nor, the, reformation, nor, the, age, of, enlightenment, which, severely, weakened, folk, spirituality, in, the, rest, of, europe, slavic, folk, religious, festivals, and, rites, reflect, the, times, of, the, ancient, pagan, calendar, for, instance, the, christmas, period, is, marked, by, the, rites, of, koliada, characterised, by, the, element, of, fire, processions, and, ritual, drama, offerings, of, food, and, drink, to, the, ancestors, spring, and, summer, rites, are, characterised, by, fire, and, water, related, imagery, spinning, around, the, figures, of, the, gods, yarilo, kupala, and, marzanna, the, switching, of, seasonal, spirits, is, celebrated, through, the, interaction, of, effigies, of, these, spirits, and, the, elements, which, symbolise, the, coming, season, such, as, by, burning, drowning, or, setting, the, effigies, onto, water, and, the, rolling, of, burning, wheels, of, straw, down, into, rivers, since, the, early, twentieth, century, there, has, been, a, reinvention, and, reinstitutionalisation, of, slavic, religion, in, the, so, called, movement, of, rodnovery, literally, slavic, native, faith, the, movement, draws, from, ancient, slavic, folk, religion, often, combining, it, with, philosophical, underpinnings, taken, from, other, religions, mainly, hinduism, 26, some, rodnover, groups, focus, almost, exclusively, on, folk, religions, and, the, worship, of, gods, at, the, right, times, of, the, year, while, others, have, developed, a, scriptural, core, represented, by, writings, purported, to, be, centuries, old, documents, such, as, the, book, of, veles, writings, which, elaborate, powerful, national, mythologemes, such, as, the, maha, vira, of, sylenkoism, and, esoteric, writings, such, as, the, slavo, aryan, vedas, of, ynglism, 50, linda, j, ivanits, reconstructed, a, basic, calendar, of, the, celebrations, of, the, most, important, slavic, gods, among, east, slavs, based, on, boris, rybakov, s, studies, on, ancient, agricultural, calendars, especially, a, fourth, century, one, from, an, area, around, kiev, the, old, russian, architecture, of, churches, originates, from, the, pre, christian, slavic, zodchestvo, russian, construction, architecture, this, pagan, style, had, a, great, influence, on, the, entire, architecture, of, ancient, russia, including, the, structure, and, decoration, of, churches, and, the, art, of, icon, painting, on, this, occasion, the, researcher, boris, grekov, wrote, neither, in, byzantium, nor, in, the, west, can, you, find, temples, with, a, large, number, of, domes, this, is, a, purely, old, russian, phenomenon, a, legacy, of, wooden, architecture, the, peculiarity, of, ancient, russian, architecture, was, also, manifested, in, the, appearance, of, the, domes, themselves, the, most, famous, of, which, is, the, onion, dome, the, historian, alexander, zamaleev, suggests, that, the, orientation, of, ancient, russian, architects, on, pagan, foundations, is, explained, primarily, by, the, difference, in, building, materials, in, byzantium, the, construction, of, temples, was, carried, out, from, stone, and, marble, while, in, ancient, russia, wooden, architecture, prevailed, this, choice, of, material, also, led, to, the, emergence, of, many, architectural, trends, including, the, so, called, tent, architecture, the, earliest, wooden, churches, in, shape, and, plan, were, a, square, or, oblong, quadrangle, with, a, tower, shaped, dome, planted, on, it, similar, to, those, that, were, placed, in, ancient, russian, fortresses, above, the, dome, under, the, cross, another, chapter, was, being, built, resembling, an, onion, outside, and, inside, the, temples, were, decorated, with, various, carvings, often, in, the, traditions, of, the, pagan, style, later, this, tradition, was, transferred, to, the, stone, church, architecture, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, old, russian, architectural, thinking, was, the, attraction, to, high, rise, composition, this, was, manifested, not, only, in, the, creation, of, tower, like, churches, moreover, the, polydoming, and, pyramidal, composition, which, was, absent, in, the, byzantine, culture, was, highly, appreciated, but, also, in, the, choice, of, a, high, place, for, religious, buildings, most, often, the, vaults, in, the, old, russian, churches, are, represented, in, the, form, of, kokoshniks, semicircular, vaults, with, a, protruding, sharp, middle, and, zakomara, semicircular, protruding, end, of, the, outer, section, of, the, wall, meanwhile, christianity, had, an, impact, on, the, old, russian, funeral, rites, corpse, burning, was, replaced, with, burial, however, among, the, common, population, there, is, a, memory, of, triangular, mounds, piled, up, over, the, burned, body, of, the, deceased, later, this, custom, developed, into, the, construction, of, a, roof, over, the, cross, the, so, called, golubets, this, style, gained, immense, popularity, in, the, russian, empire, thereby, reviving, in, the, form, of, neo, russian, architecture
