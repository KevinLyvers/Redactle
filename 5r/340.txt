to, the, hebrew, bible, daniel, was, a, noble, jewish, youth, of, jerusalem, taken, into, captivity, by, nebuchadnezzar, ii, of, babylon, serving, the, king, and, his, successors, with, loyalty, and, ability, until, the, time, of, the, persian, conqueror, cyrus, all, the, while, remaining, true, to, the, god, of, israel, while, some, conservative, scholars, hold, that, daniel, existed, and, his, book, was, written, in, the, 6th, century, bce, most, scholars, agree, that, daniel, is, not, a, historical, figure, and, that, much, of, the, book, is, a, cryptic, allusion, to, the, reign, of, the, 2nd, century, bce, hellenistic, king, antiochus, iv, epiphanes, six, cities, claim, the, tomb, of, daniel, the, most, famous, being, that, in, susa, in, southern, iran, at, a, site, known, as, shush, e, daniyal, he, is, not, a, prophet, in, judaism, but, the, rabbis, reckoned, him, to, be, the, most, distinguished, member, of, the, babylonian, diaspora, unsurpassed, in, piety, and, good, deeds, firm, in, his, adherence, to, the, law, despite, being, surrounded, by, enemies, who, sought, his, ruin, and, in, the, first, few, centuries, ce, they, wrote, down, the, many, legends, that, had, grown, up, around, his, name, he, is, considered, a, prophet, in, christianity, and, although, he, is, not, mentioned, in, the, quran, muslim, sources, describe, him, as, a, prophet, daniel, s, name, means, god, el, is, my, judge, while, the, best, known, daniel, is, the, hero, of, the, book, of, daniel, who, interprets, dreams, and, receives, apocalyptic, visions, the, bible, also, briefly, mentions, three, other, individuals, of, this, name, daniel, dn, il, or, danel, is, also, the, name, of, a, figure, in, the, aqhat, legend, from, ugarit, ugarit, was, a, canaanite, city, destroyed, around, 1200, bce, the, tablet, containing, the, story, is, dated, c, 1360, bce, this, legendary, daniel, is, known, for, his, righteousness, and, wisdom, and, a, follower, of, the, god, el, hence, his, name, who, made, the, god, s, will, known, through, dreams, and, visions, it, is, unlikely, that, ezekiel, knew, the, far, older, canaanite, legend, but, it, seems, reasonable, to, suppose, that, some, connection, exists, between, the, two, the, authors, of, the, tales, in, the, first, half, of, the, book, of, daniel, were, likely, also, unaware, of, the, ugaritic, daniel, and, probably, took, the, name, of, their, hero, from, ezekiel, the, author, of, the, visions, in, the, second, half, in, turn, took, his, hero, s, name, from, the, tales, some, scholars, have, suggested, identifying, the, daniel, character, in, ezekiel, 28, with, king, david, s, son, daniel, the, book, of, daniel, begins, with, an, introduction, telling, how, daniel, and, his, companions, came, to, be, in, babylon, followed, by, a, set, of, tales, set, in, the, babylonian, and, persian, courts, in, the, late, 7th, and, early, 6th, centuries, bce, followed, in, turn, by, a, set, of, visions, in, which, daniel, sees, the, remote, future, of, the, world, and, of, israel, the, tales, in, chapters, 1, 6, can, be, dated, to, the, 3rd, or, early, 2nd, centuries, bce, it, is, generally, accepted, that, these, were, expanded, by, the, addition, of, the, visions, in, chapters, 8, 12, between, 167, and, 164, bce, in, the, third, year, of, the, reign, of, jehoiakim, daniel, and, his, friends, hananiah,

smashed, by, a, stone, from, heaven, only, daniel, is, able, to, interpret, it, the, dream, signifies, four, kingdoms, of, which, babylon, is, the, first, but, god, will, destroy, them, and, replace, them, with, his, own, kingdom, nebuchadnezzar, dreams, of, a, great, tree, that, shelters, all, the, world, and, of, a, heavenly, figure, who, decrees, that, the, tree, will, be, destroyed, again, only, daniel, can, interpret, the, dream, which, concerns, the, sovereignty, of, god, over, the, kings, of, the, earth, when, nebuchadnezzar, s, son, belshazzar, uses, consecrated, vessels, from, the, jewish, temple, as, serving, vessels, for, his, extravagant, feast, a, hand, appears, and, writes, a, mysterious, message, on, a, wall, which, only, daniel, can, interpret, it, tells, the, king, that, his, kingdom, will, be, given, to, the, medes, and, persians, because, belshazzar, unlike, nebuchadnezzar, has, not, acknowledged, the, sovereignty, of, the, god, of, daniel, the, medes, and,
