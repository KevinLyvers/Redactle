lilith, l, l, hebrew, romanized, l, l, also, spelled, lilit, lilitu, or, lilis, is, a, feminine, figure, in, mesopotamian, and, jewish, mythology, theorized, to, be, the, first, wife, of, adam, and, a, primordial, she, demon, lilith, is, cited, as, having, been, banished, from, the, garden, of, eden, for, not, complying, with, and, obeying, adam, the, original, hebrew, word, from, which, the, name, lilith, is, taken, is, in, the, biblical, hebrew, in, the, book, of, isaiah, though, lilith, herself, is, not, mentioned, in, any, biblical, text, in, late, antiquity, in, mandaean, and, jewish, sources, from, 500, ad, onward, lilith, appears, in, historiolas, incantations, incorporating, a, short, mythic, story, in, various, concepts, and, localities, that, give, partial, descriptions, of, her, she, is, mentioned, in, the, babylonian, talmud, eruvin, 100b, niddah, 24b, shabbat, 151b, bava, batra, 73a, in, the, conflict, of, adam, and, eve, with, satan, as, adam, s, first, wife, and, in, the, zohar, leviticus, 19a, as, a, hot, fiery, female, who, first, cohabited, with, man, many, rabbinic, authorities, including, maimonides, and, menachem, meiri, reject, the, existence, of, lilith, the, name, lilith, stems, from, lil, lil, tu, and, w, ardat, lil, the, akkadian, word, lil, is, related, to, the, hebrew, word, lilit, appearing, in, isaiah, 34, 14, which, is, thought, to, be, a, night, bird, by, some, modern, scholars, such, as, judit, m, blair, in, mesopotamian, religion, found, in, the, cuneiform, texts, of, sumer, assyria, and, babylonia, lil, tu, is, a, spirit, or, demon, many, have, also, connected, her, to, the, mesopotamian, demon, lamashtu, who, shares, similar, traits, and, a, similar, position, in, mythology, to, lilith, lilith, continues, to, serve, as, source, material, in, today, s, popular, culture, western, culture, literature, occultism, fantasy, and, horror, in, some, jewish, folklore, such, as, the, alphabet, of, sirach, c, 700, 1000, ad, lilith, appears, as, adam, s, first, wife, who, was, created, at, the, same, time, and, from, the, same, clay, as, adam, the, legend, of, lilith, developed, extensively, during, the, middle, ages, in, the, tradition, of, aggadah, the, zohar, and, jewish, mysticism, for, example, in, the, 13th, century, writings, of, isaac, ben, jacob, ha, cohen, lilith, left, adam, after, she, refused, to, become, subservient, to, him, and, then, would, not, return, to, the, garden, of, eden, after, she, had, coupled, with, the, archangel, samael, interpretations, of, lilith, found, in, later, jewish, materials, are, plentiful, but, little, information, has, survived, relating, to, the, sumerian, assyrian, and, babylonian, views, of, this, class, of, demons, recent, scholarship, has, disputed, the, relevance, of, two, sources, previously, used, to, connect, the, jewish, lilith, to, an, akkadian, lil, tu, the, gilgamesh, appendix, and, the, arslan, tash, amulets, see, below, for, discussion, of, these, two, problematic, sources, in, contrast, some, scholars, such, as, lowell, k, handy, hold, the, view, that, though, lilith, derives, from, mesopotamian, demonology, evidence, of, the, hebrew, lilith, being, present, in, the, sources, frequently, cited, the, sumerian, gilgamesh, fragment, and, the, sumerian, incantation, from, arshlan, tash, being, two, is, scant, if, present, at, all, 174, in, hebrew, language, texts, the, term, lilith, or, lilit, translated, as, night, creatures, night, monster, night, hag, or, screech, owl, first, occurs, in, a, list, of, animals, in, isaiah, 34, the, isaiah, 34, 14, lilith, reference, does, not, appear, in, most, common, bible, translations, such, as, kjv, and, niv, commentators, and, interpreters, often, envision, the, figure, of, lilith, as, a, dangerous, demon, of, the, night, who, is, sexually, wanton, and, who, steals, babies, in, the, darkness, currently, there, is, no, scholarly, consensus, with, some, adhering, to, the, animalistic, interpretation, where, as, others, claim, 34, 14, is, referencing, a, literal, demon, or, a, category, of, demons, falling, under, the, specification, of, lilith, historically, certain, prominent, jewish, rabbis, in, talmudic, texts, feared, the, likes, of, liliths, some, to, such, an, extent, that, they, recommended, men, not, sleep, in, a, home, alone, as, any, who, do, would, be, seized, by, lilith, jewish, incantation, bowls, and, amulets, from, mesopotamia, from, the, first, to, the, eighth, centuries, identify, lilith, as, a, female, demon, and, provide, the, first, visual, depictions, of, her, the, said, amulets, were, often, symbolic, divorce, papers, warding, off, a, given, lilith, that, was, thought, to, be, haunting, one, s, house, or, family, in, the, akkadian, language, of, assyria, and, babylonia, the, terms, lili, and, l, l, tu, mean, spirits, some, uses, of, l, l, tu, are, listed, in, the, assyrian, dictionary, of, the, oriental, institute, of, the, university, of, chicago, cad, 1956, l, 190, in, wolfram, von, soden, s, akkadisches, handw, rterbuch, ahw, p, 553, and, reallexikon, der, assyriologie, rla, p, 47, the, sumerian, female, demons, lili, have, no, etymological, relation, to, akkadian, lilu, evening, archibald, sayce, 1882, considered, that, the, hebrew, and, the, earlier, akkadian, names, are, derived, from, proto, semitic, charles, fossey, 1902, has, this, literally, translating, to, female, night, being, demon, although, cuneiform, inscriptions, from, mesopotamia, exist, where, l, l, t, and, l, l, tu, refers, to, disease, bearing, wind, spirits, samuel, noah, kramer, 1932, published, 1938, translated, ki, sikil, lil, la, ke, as, lilith, in, tablet, xii, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, dated, c, 600, bc, tablet, xii, is, not, part, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, but, is, a, later, assyrian, akkadian, translation, of, the, latter, part, of, the, sumerian, epic, of, gilgamesh, the, ki, sikil, lil, la, ke, is, associated, with, a, serpent, and, a, zu, bird, in, gilgamesh, enkidu, and, the, netherworld, a, huluppu, tree, grows, in, inanna, s, garden, in, uruk, whose, wood, she, plans, to, use, to, build, a, new, throne, after, ten, years, of, growth, she, comes, to, harvest, it, and, finds, a, serpent, living, at, its, base, a, zu, bird, raising, young, in, its, crown, and, that, a, ki, sikil, lil, la, ke, made, a, house, in, its, trunk, gilgamesh, is, said, to, have, killed, the, snake, and, then, the, zu, bird, flew, away, to, the, mountains, with, its, young, while, the, ki, sikil, lil, la, ke, fearfully, destroys, its, house, and, runs, for, the, forest, identification, of, the, ki, sikil, lil, la, ke, as, lilith, is, stated, in, the, dictionary, of, deities, and, demons, in, the, bible, 1999, according, to, a, new, source, from, late, antiquity, lilith, appears, in, a, mandaean, magic, story, where, she, is, considered, to, represent, the, branches, of, a, tree, with, other, demonic, figures, that, form, other, parts, of, the, tree, though, this, may, also, include, multiple, liliths, suggested, translations, for, the, tablet, xii, spirit, in, the, tree, include, ki, sikil, as, sacred, place, lil, as, spirit, and, lil, la, ke, as, water, spirit, but, also, simply, owl, given, that, the, lil, is, building, a, home, in, the, trunk, of, the, tree, a, connection, between, the, gilgamesh, ki, sikil, lil, la, ke, and, the, jewish, lilith, was, rejected, on, textual, grounds, by, sergio, ribichini, 1978, kramer, s, translation, of, the, gilgamesh, fragment, was, used, by, henri, frankfort, 1937, and, emil, kraeling, 1937, to, support, identification, of, a, woman, with, wings, and, bird, feet, in, the, disputed, burney, relief, as, related, to, lilith, frankfort, and, kraeling, identified, the, figure, in, the, relief, with, lilith, today, the, identification, of, the, burney, relief, with, lilith, is, questioned, modern, research, has, identified, the, figure, as, one, of, the, main, goddesses, of, the, mesopotamian, pantheons, most, probably, ereshkigal, but, the, figure, is, more, generally, identified, as, the, goddess, of, love, and, war, thorkild, jacobsen, identified, the, figure, as, inanna, in, an, analysis, based, on, the, existence, of, symbols, and, attributes, commonly, recognized, to, the, goddess, and, on, textual, evidence, the, arslan, tash, amulets, are, limestone, plaques, discovered, in, 1933, at, arslan, tash, the, authenticity, of, which, is, disputed, william, f, albright, theodor, h, gaster, and, others, accepted, the, amulets, as, a, pre, jewish, source, which, shows, that, the, name, lilith, already, existed, in, the, 7th, century, bc, but, torczyner, 1947, identified, the, amulets, as, a, later, jewish, source, many, have, alternatively, drawn, connections, between, lilith, and, the, mesopotamian, demon, lamashtu, due, to, their, similar, position, and, traits, in, both, mythologies, the, word, lilit, or, lilith, only, appears, once, in, the, hebrew, bible, in, a, prophecy, regarding, the, fate, of, edom, most, other, nouns, in, the, list, appear, more, than, once, and, thus, are, better, documented, with, the, exception, of, another, hapax, legomenon, the, word, qippoz, the, reading, of, scholars, and, translators, is, often, guided, by, a, decision, about, the, complete, list, of, eight, creatures, as, a, whole, quoting, from, isaiah, 34, nab, 12, her, nobles, shall, be, no, more, nor, shall, kings, be, proclaimed, there, all, her, princes, are, gone, 13, her, castles, shall,

satyrs, shall, call, to, one, another, there, shall, the, lilith, repose, and, find, for, herself, a, place, to, rest, 15, there, the, hoot, owl, shall, nest, and, lay, eggs, hatch, them, out, and, gather, them, in, her, shadow, there, shall, the, kites, assemble, none, shall, be, missing, its, mate, 16, look, in, the, book, of, the, lord, and, read, no, one, of, these, shall, be, lacking, for,

lilith, was, a, demon, of, the, night, known, also, by, the, jewish, exiles, in, babylon, schrader, s, and, levy, s, view, is, therefore, partly, dependent, on, a, later, dating, of, deutero, isaiah, to, the, 6th, century, bc, and, the, presence, of, jews, in, baghdad, in, the, neo, babylonian, empire, which, would, coincide, with, the, possible, references, to, the, lil, tu, in, babylonian, demonology, however, this, view, is, challenged, by, some, modern, researchers, such, as, judit, m, blair, 2009, who, argues, that, the, context, indicates, unclean, animals, the, septuagint, translates, both, the, reference, to, lilith, and, the, word, for, jackals, or, wild, beasts, of, the, island, within, the, same, verse, into, greek, as, onokentauros, apparently, assuming, them, to, refer, to, the, same, creatures, and, omitting, wildcats, wild, beasts, of, the, desert, under, this, reading, instead, of, the, wildcats, or, desert, beasts, meeting, with, the, jackals, or, island, beasts, the, goat, or, satyr, crying, to, his, fellow, and, lilith, or, screech, owl, resting, there, it, is, the, goat, or, satyr, translated, as, daimonia, demons, and, the, jackals, or, island,

warning, to, lead, them, astray, from, a, spirit, of, understanding, and, to, make, their, heart, and, their, desolate, during, the, present, dominion, of, wickedness, and, predetermined, time, of, humiliations, for, the, sons, of, lig, by, the, guilt, of, the, ages, of, smitten, by, iniquity, not, for, eternal, destruction, t, for, an, era, of, humiliation, for, transgression, as, with, the, massoretic, text, of, isaiah, 34, 14, and, therefore, unlike, the, plural, liliyyot, or, liliyyoth, in, the, isaiah, scroll, 34, 14, lilit, in, 4q510, is, singular, this, liturgical, text, both, cautions, against, the, presence, of, supernatural, malevolence, and, assumes, familiarity, with, lilith, distinct, from, the, biblical, text, however, this, passage, does, not, function, under, any, socio, political, agenda, but, instead, serves, in, the, same, capacity, as, an, exorcism, 4q560, and, songs, to, disperse, demons, 11q11, the, text, is, thus, to, a, community, deeply, involved, in, the, realm, of, demonology, an, exorcism, hymn, joseph, m, baumgarten, 1991, identified, the, unnamed, woman, of, the, seductress, 4q184, as, related, to, the, female, demon, however, john, j, collins, regards, this, identification, as, intriguing, but, that, it, is, safe, to, say, that, 4q184, is, based, on, the, strange, woman, of, proverbs, 2, 5, 7, 9, her, house, sinks, down, to, death, and, her, course, leads, to, the, shades, all, who, go, to, her, cannot, return, and, find, again, the, paths, of, life, her, gates, are, gates, of, death, and, from, the, entrance, of, the, house, she, sets, out, towards, sheol, none, of, those, who, enter, there, will, ever, return, and, all, who, possess, her, will, descend, to, the, pit, lilith, does, not, occur, in, the, mishnah, the, jerusalem, talmud, contains, one, mention, in, the, 1523, bomberg, edition, shabbat, 6, 9, which, is, not, supported, by, any, manuscript, the, word, lilit, appears, five, times, in, the, babylonian, talmud, the, above, statement, by, hanina, may, be, related, to, the, belief, that, nocturnal, emissions, engendered, the, birth, of, demons, the, midrash, rabbah, collection, contains, two, references, to, lilith, the, first, one, is, present, in, genesis, rabbah, 22, 7, and, 18, 4, according, to, rabbi, yehuda, berabbi, god, proceeded, to, create, a, second, eve, for, adam, after, lilith, had, to, return, to, dust, however, to, be, exact, the, said, passages, do, not, employ, the, hebrew, word, lilith, itself, and, instead, speak, of, the, first, eve, hebrew, romanized, aww, h, r, n, analogical, to, adam, ha, rishon, the, first, adam, although, in, the, medieval, hebrew, literature, and, folklore, especially, that, reflected, on, the, protective, amulets, of, various, kinds, the, first, eve, was, identified, with, lilith, one, should, remain, careful, in, transposing, this, equation, to, the, late, antiquity, the, second, mention, of, lilith, this, time, explicit, is, present, in, numbers, rabbah, 16, 25, the, midrash, develops, the, story, of, moses, s, plea, after, god, expresses, anger, at, the, bad, report, of, the, spies, moses, responds, to, a, threat, by, god, that, he, will, destroy, the, israelite, people, moses, pleads, before, god, that, god, should, not, be, like, lilith, who, kills, her, own, children, moses, said, do, not, do, it, that, the, nations, of, the, world, may, not, regard, you, as, a, cruel, being, and, say, the, generation, of, the, flood, came, and, he, destroyed, them, the, generation, of, the, separation, came, and, he, destroyed, them, the, sodomites, and, the, egyptians, came, and, he, destroyed, them, and, these, also, whom, he, called, my, son, my, firstborn, ex, iv, 22, he, is, now, destroying, as, that, lilith, who, when, she, finds, nothing, else, turns, upon, her, own, children, so, because, the, lord, was, not, able, to, bring, this, people, into, the, land, he, hath, slain, them, num, xiv, 16, an, individual, lilith, along, with, bagdana, king, of, the, lilits, is, one, of, the, demons, to, feature, prominently, in, protective, spells, in, the, eighty, surviving, jewish, occult, incantation, bowls, from, sassanid, empire, babylon, 4th, 6th, century, ad, with, influence, from, iranian, culture, these, bowls, were, buried, upside, down, below, the, structure, of, the, house, or, on, the, land, of, the, house, in, order, to, trap, the, demon, or, demoness, almost, every, house, was, found, to, have, such, protective, bowls, against, demons, and, demonesses, the, centre, of, the, inside, of, the, bowl, depicts, lilith, or, the, male, form, lilit, surrounding, the, image, is, writing, in, spiral, form, the, writing, often, begins, at, the, centre, and, works, its, way, to, the, edge, the, writing, is, most, commonly, scripture, or, references, to, the, talmud, the, incantation, bowls, which, have, been, analysed, are, inscribed, in, the, following, languages, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, syriac, mandaic, middle, persian, and, arabic, some, bowls, are, written, in, a, false, script, which, has, no, meaning, the, correctly, worded, incantation, bowl, was, capable, of, warding, off, lilith, or, lilit, from, the, household, lilith, had, the, power, to, transform, into, a, woman, s, physical, features, seduce, her, husband, and, conceive, a, child, however, lilith, would, become, hateful, toward, the, children, born, of, the, husband, and, wife, and, would, seek, to, kill, them, similarly, lilit, would, transform, into, the, physical, features, of, the, husband, seduce, the, wife, she, would, give, birth, to, a, child, it, would, become, evident, that, the, child, was, not, fathered, by, the, husband, and, the, child, would, be, looked, down, on, lilit, would, seek, revenge, on, the, family, by, killing, the, children, born, to, the, husband, and, wife, key, features, of, the, depiction, of, lilith, or, lilit, include, the, following, the, figure, is, often, depicted, with, arms, and, legs, chained, indicating, the, control, of, the, family, over, the, demon, ess, the, demon, ess, is, depicted, in, a, frontal, position, with, the, whole, face, showing, the, eyes, are, very, large, as, well, as, the, hands, if, depicted, the, demon, ess, is, entirely, static, one, bowl, contains, the, following, inscription, commissioned, from,

considered, to, be, the, oldest, form, of, the, story, of, lilith, as, adam, s, first, wife, whether, this, particular, tradition, is, older, is, not, known, scholars, tend, to, date, the, alphabet, between, the, 8th, and, 10th, centuries, ad, the, work, has, been, characterized, by, some, scholars, as, satirical, but, ginzberg, concluded, it, was, meant, seriously, in, the, text, an, amulet, is, inscribed, with, the, names, of, three, angels, senoy, sansenoy, and, semangelof, and, placed, around, the, neck, of, newborn, boys, in, order, to, protect, them, from, the, lilin, until, their, circumcision, the, amulets, used, against, lilith, that, were, thought, to, derive, from, this, tradition, are, in, fact, dated, as, being, much, older, the, concept, of, eve, having, a, predecessor, is, not, exclusive, to, the, alphabet, and, is, not, a, new, concept, as, it, can, be, found, in, genesis, rabbah, however, the, idea, that, lilith, was, the, predecessor, may, be, exclusive, to, the, alphabet, the, idea, in, the, text, that, adam, had, a, wife, prior, to, eve, may, have, developed, from, an, interpretation, of, the, book, of, genesis, and, its, dual, creation, accounts, while, genesis, 2, 22, describes, god, s, creation, of, eve, from, adam, s, rib, an, earlier, passage, 1, 27, already, indicates, that, a, woman, had, been, made, so, god, created, man, in, his, own, image, in, the, image, of, god, created, he, him, male, and, female, created, he, them, the, alphabet, text, places, lilith, s, creation, after, god, s, words, in, genesis, 2, 18, that, it, is, not, good, for, man, to, be, alone, in, this, text, god, forms, lilith, out, of, the, clay, from, which, he, made, adam, but, she, and, adam, bicker, lilith, claims, that, since, she, and, adam, were, created, in, the, same, way, they, were, equal, and, she, refuses, to, submit, to, him, after, god, created, adam, who, was, alone, he, said, it, is, not, good, for, man, to, be, alone, he, then, created, a, woman, for, adam, from, the, earth, as, he, had, created, adam, himself, and, called, her, lilith, adam, and, lilith, immediately, began, to, fight, she, said, i, will, not, lie, below, and, he, said, i, will, not, lie, beneath, you, but, only, on, top, for, you, are, fit, only, to, be, in, the, bottom, position, while, i, am, to, be, the, superior, one, lilith, responded, we, are, equal, to, each, other, inasmuch, as, we, were, both, created, from, the, earth, but, they, would, not, listen, to, one, another, when, lilith, saw, this, she, pronounced, the, ineffable, name, and, flew, away, into, the, air, adam, stood, in, prayer, before, his, creator, sovereign, of, the, universe, he, said, the, woman, you, gave, me, has, run, away, at, once, the, holy, one, blessed, be, he, sent, these, three, angels, senoy, sansenoy, and, semangelof, to, bring, her, back, said, the, holy, one, to, adam, if, she, agrees, to, come, back, what, is, made, is, good, if, not, she, must, permit, one, hundred, of, her, children, to, die, every, day, the, angels, left, god, and, pursued, lilith, whom, they, overtook, in, the, midst, of, the, sea, in, the, mighty, waters, wherein, the, egyptians, were, destined, to, drown, they, told, her, god, s, word, but, she, did, not, wish, to, return, the, angels, said, we, shall, drown, you, in, the, sea, leave, me, she, said, i, was, created, only, to, cause, sickness, to, infants, if, the, infant, is, male, i, have, dominion, over, him, for, eight, days, after, his, birth, and, if, female, for, twenty, days, when, the, angels, heard, lilith, s, words, they, insisted, she, go, back, but, she, swore, to, them, by, the, name, of, the, living, and, eternal, god, whenever, i, see, you, or, your, names, or, your, forms, in, an, amulet, i, will, have, no, power, over, that, infant, she, also, agreed, to, have, one, hundred, of, her, children, die, every, day, accordingly, every, day, one, hundred, demons, perish, and, for, the, same, reason, we, write, the, angels, names, on, the, amulets, of, young, children, when, lilith, sees, their, names, she, remembers, her, oath, and, the, child, recovers, the, background, and, purpose, of, the, alphabet, of, ben, sira, is, unclear, it, is, a, collection, of, stories, about, heroes, of, the, bible, and, talmud, it, may, have, been, a, collection, of, folk, tales, a, refutation, of, christian, karaite, or, other, separatist, movements, its, content, seems, so, offensive, to, contemporary, jews, that, it, was, even, suggested, that, it, could, be, an, anti, jewish, satire, although, in, any, case, the, text, was, accepted, by, the, jewish, mystics, of, medieval, germany, the, alphabet, of, ben, sira, is, the, earliest, surviving, source, of, the, story, and, the, conception, that, lilith, was, adam, s, first, wife, became, only, widely, known, with, the, 17th, century, lexicon, talmudicum, of, german, scholar, johannes, buxtorf, in, this, folk, tradition, that, arose, in, the, early, middle, ages, lilith, a, dominant, female, demon, became, identified, with, asmodeus, king, of, demons, as, his, queen, asmodeus, was, already, well, known, by, this, time, because, of, the, legends, about, him, in, the, talmud, thus, the, merging, of, lilith, and, asmodeus, was, inevitable, the, second, myth, of, lilith, grew, to, include, legends, about, another, world, and, by, some, accounts, this, other, world, existed, side, by, side, with, this, one, yenne, velt, is, yiddish, for, this, described, other, world, in, this, case, asmodeus, and, lilith, were, believed, to, procreate, demonic, offspring, endlessly, and, spread, chaos, at, every, turn, two, primary, characteristics, are, seen, in, these, legends, about, lilith, lilith, as, the, incarnation, of, lust, causing, men, to, be, led, astray, and, lilith, as, a, child, killing, witch, who, strangles, helpless, neonates, these, two, aspects, of, the, lilith, legend, seemed, to, have, evolved, separately, there, is, hardly, a, tale, where, she, encompasses, both, roles, but, the, aspect, of, the, witch, like, role, that, lilith, plays, broadens, her, archetype, of, the, destructive, side, of, witchcraft, such, stories, are, commonly, found, among, jewish, folklore, although, the, image, of, lilith, of, the, alphabet, of, ben, sira, is, unprecedented, some, elements, in, her, portrayal, can, be, traced, back, to, the, talmudic, and, midrashic, traditions, that, arose, around, eve, first, and, foremost, the, very, introduction, of, lilith, to, the, creation, story, rests, on, the, rabbinic, myth, prompted, by, the, two, separate, creation, accounts, in, genesis, 1, 1, 2, 25, that, there, were, two, original, women, a, way, of, resolving, the, apparent, discrepancy, between, these, two, accounts, was, to, assume, that, there, must, have, been, some, other, first, woman, apart, from, the, one, later, identified, with, eve, the, rabbis, noting, adam, s, exclamation, this, time, zot, hapa, am, bone, of, my, bone, and, flesh, of, my, flesh, genesis, 2, 23, took, it, as, an, intimation, that, there, must, already, have, been, a, first, time, according, to, genesis, rabbah, 18, 4, adam, was, disgusted, upon, seeing, the, first, woman, full, of, discharge, and, blood, and, god, had, to, provide, him, with, another, one, the, subsequent, creation, is, performed, with, adequate, precautions, adam, is, made, to, sleep, so, as, not, to, witness, the, process, itself, sanhedrin, 39a, and, eve, is, adorned, with, fine, jewellery, genesis, rabbah, 18, 1, and, brought, to, adam, by, the, angels, gabriel, and, michael, ibid, 18, 3, however, nowhere, do, the, rabbis, specify, what, happened, to, the, first, woman, leaving, the, matter, open, for, further, speculation, this, is, the, gap, into, which, the, later, tradition, of, lilith, could, fit, second, this, new, woman, is, still, met, with, harsh, rabbinic, allegations, again, playing, on, the, hebrew, phrase, zot, hapa, am, adam, according, to, the, same, midrash, declares, it, is, she, who, is, destined, to, strike, the, bell, and, to, speak, against, me, as, you, read, a, golden, bell, and, a, pomegranate, it, is, she, who, will, trouble, me, all, night, genesis, rabbah, 18, 4, the, first, woman, also, becomes, the, object, of, accusations, ascribed, to, rabbi, joshua, of, siknin, according, to, whom, eve, despite, the, divine, efforts, turned, out, to, be, swelled, headed, coquette, eavesdropper, gossip, prone, to, jealousy, light, fingered, and, gadabout, genesis, rabbah, 18, 2, a, similar, set, of, charges, appears, in, genesis, rabbah, 17, 8, according, to, which, eve, s, creation, from, adam, s, rib, rather, than, from, the, earth, makes, her, inferior, to, adam, and, never, satisfied, with, anything, third, and, despite, the, terseness, of, the, biblical, text, in, this, regard, the, erotic, iniquities, attributed, to, eve, constitute, a, separate, category, of, her, shortcomings, told, in, genesis, 3, 16, that, your, desire, shall, be, for, your, husband, she, is, accused, by, the, rabbis, of, having, an, overdeveloped, sexual, drive, genesis, rabbah, 20, 7, and, constantly, enticing, adam, genesis, rabbah, 23, 5, however, in, terms, of, textual, popularity, and, dissemination, the, motif, of, eve, copulating, with, the, primeval, serpent, takes, priority, over, her, other, sexual, transgressions, despite, the, rather, unsettling, picturesqueness, of, this, account, it, is, conveyed, in, numerous, places, genesis, rabbah, 18, 6, and, bt, sotah, 9b, shabbat, 145b, 146a, and, 156a, yevamot, 103b, and, avodah, zarah, 22b, kabbalistic, mysticism, attempted, to, establish, a, more, exact, relationship, between, lilith, and, god, with, her, major, characteristics, having, been, well, developed, by, the, end, of, the, talmudic, period, after, six, centuries, had, elapsed, between, the, aramaic, incantation, texts, that, mention, lilith, and, the, early, spanish, kabbalistic, writings, in, the, 13th, century, she, reappears, and, her, life, history, becomes, known, in, greater, mythological, detail, her, creation, is, described, in, many, alternative, versions, one, mentions, her, creation, as, being, before, adam, s, on, the, fifth, day, because, the, living, creatures, with, whose, swarms, god, filled, the, waters, included, lilith, a, similar, version, related, to, the, earlier, talmudic, passages, recounts, how, lilith, was, fashioned, with, the, same, substance, as, adam, was, shortly, before, a, third, alternative, version, states, that, god, originally, created, adam, and, lilith, in, a, manner, that, the, female, creature, was, contained, in, the, male, lilith, s, soul, was, lodged, in, the, depths, of, the, great, abyss, when, god, called, her, she, joined, adam, after, adam, s, body, was, created, a, thousand, souls, from, the, left, evil, side, attempted, to, attach, themselves, to, him, however, god, drove, them, off, adam, was, left, lying, as, a, body, without, a, soul, then, a, cloud, descended, and, god, commanded, the, earth, to, produce, a, living, soul, this, god, breathed, into, adam, who, began, to, spring, to, life, and, his, female, was, attached, to, his, side, god, separated, the, female, from, adam, s, side, the, female, side, was, lilith, whereupon, she, flew, to, the, cities, of, the, sea, and, attacked, humankind, yet, another, version, claims, that, lilith, emerged, as, a, divine, entity, that, was, born, spontaneously, either, out, of, the, great, supernal, abyss, or, out, of, the, power, of, an, aspect, of, god, the, gevurah, of, din, this, aspect, of, god, was, negative, and, punitive, as, well, as, one, of, his, ten, attributes, sefirot, at, its, lowest, manifestation, has, an, affinity, with, the, realm, of, evil, and, it, is, out, of, this, that, lilith, merged, with, samael, an, alternative, story, links, lilith, with, the, creation, of, luminaries, the, first, light, which, is, the, light, of, mercy, one, of, the, sefirot, appeared, on, the, first, day, of, creation, when, god, said, let, there, be, light, this, light, became, hidden, and, the, holiness, became, surrounded, by, a, husk, of, evil, a, husk, klippa, was, created, around, the, brain, and, this, husk, spread, and, brought, out, another, husk, which, was, lilith, the, first, medieval, source, to, depict, adam, and, lilith, in, full, was, the, midrash, a, b, k, i, r, c, 10th, century, which, was, followed, by, the, zohar, and, other, kabbalistic, writings, adam, is, said, to, be, perfect, until, he, recognises, either, his, sin, or, cain, s, fratricide, that, is, the, cause, of, bringing, death, into, the, world, he, then, separates, from, holy, eve, sleeps, alone, and, fasts, for, 130, years, during, this, time, pizna, either, an, alternate, name, for, lilith, or, a, daughter, of, hers, desires, his, beauty, and, seduces, him, against, his, will, she, gives, birth, to, multitudes, of, djinns, and, demons, the, first, of, them, being, named, agrimas, however, they, are, defeated, by, methuselah, who, slays, thousands, of, them, with, a, holy, sword, and, forces, agrimas, to, give, him, the, names, of, the, rest, after, which, he, casts, them, away, to, the, sea, and, the, mountains, the, mystical, writing, of, two, brothers, jacob, and, isaac, hacohen, treatise, on, the, left, emanation, which, predates, the, zohar, by, a, few, decades, states, that, samael, and, lilith, are, in, the, shape, of, an, androgynous, being, double, faced, born, out, of, the, emanation, of, the, throne, of, glory, and, corresponding, in, the, spiritual, realm, to, adam, and, eve, who, were, likewise, born, as, a, hermaphrodite, the, two, twin, androgynous, couples, resembled, each, other, and, both, were, like, the, image, of, above, that, is, that, they, are, reproduced, in, a, visible, form, of, an, androgynous, deity, 19, in, answer, to, your, question, concerning, lilith, i, shall, explain, to, you, the, essence, of, the, matter, concerning, this, point, there, is, a, received, tradition, from, the, ancient, sages, who, made, use, of, the, secret, knowledge, of, the, lesser, palaces, which, is, the, manipulation, of, demons, and, a, ladder, by, which, one, ascends, to, the, prophetic, levels, in, this, tradition, it, is, made, clear, that, samael, and, lilith, were, born, as, one, similar, to, the, form, of, adam, and, eve, who, were, also, born, as, one, reflecting, what, is, above, this, is, the, account, of, lilith, which, was, received, by, the, sages, in, the, secret, knowledge, of, the, palaces, another, version, that, was, also, current, among, kabbalistic, circles, in, the, middle, ages, establishes, lilith, as, the, first, of, samael, s, four, wives, lilith, naamah, eisheth, and, agrat, bat, mahlat, each, of, them, are, mothers, of, demons, and, have, their, own, hosts, and, unclean, spirits, in, no, number, the, marriage, of, archangel, samael, and, lilith, was, arranged, by, tanin, iver, blind, dragon, who, is, the, counterpart, of, the, dragon, that, is, in, the, sea, blind, dragon, acts, as, an, intermediary, between, lilith, and, samael, blind, dragon, rides, lilith, the, sinful, may, she, be, extirpated, quickly, in, our, days, amen, and, this, blind, dragon, brings, about, the, union, between, samael, and, lilith, and, just, as, the, dragon, that, is, in, the, sea, isa, 27, 1, has, no, eyes, likewise, blind, dragon, that, is, above, in, the, likeness, of, a, spiritual, form, is, without, eyes, that, is, to, say, without, colors, patai, 81, 458, samael, is, called, the, slant, serpent, and, lilith, is, called, the, tortuous, serpent, the, marriage, of, samael, and, lilith, is, known, as, the, angel, satan, or, the, other, god, but, it, was, not, allowed, to, last, to, prevent, lilith, and, samael, s, demonic, children, lilin, from, filling, the, world, god, castrated, samael, in, many, 17th, century, kabbalistic, books, this, seems, to, be, a, reinterpretation, of, an, old, talmudic, myth, where, god, castrated, the, male, leviathan, and, slew, the, female, leviathan, in, order, to, prevent, them, from, mating, and, thereby, destroying, the, earth, with, their, offspring, with, lilith, being, unable, to, fornicate, with, samael, anymore, she, sought, to, couple, with, men, who, experience, nocturnal, emissions, a, 15th, or, 16th, century, kabbalah, text, states, that, god, has, cooled, the, female, leviathan, meaning, that, he, has, made, lilith, infertile, and, she, is, a, mere, fornication, the, treatise, on, the, left, emanation, also, says, that, there, are, two, liliths, the, lesser, being, married, to, the, great, demon, asmodeus, the, matron, lilith, is, the, mate, of, samael, both, of, them, were, born, at, the, same, hour, in, the, image, of, adam, and, eve, intertwined, in, each, other, asmodeus, the, great, king, of, the, demons, has, as, a, mate, the, lesser, younger, lilith, daughter, of, the, king, whose, name, is, qafsefoni, the, name, of, his, mate, is, mehetabel, daughter, of, matred, and, their, daughter, is, lilith, another, passage, charges, lilith, as, being, a, tempting, serpent, of, eve, and, the, serpent, the, woman, of, harlotry, incited, and, seduced, eve, through, the, husks, of, light, which, in, itself, is, holiness, and, the, serpent, seduced, holy, eve, and, enough, said, for, him, who, understands, and, all, this, ruination, came, about, because, adam, the, first, man, coupled, with, eve, while, she, was, in, her, menstrual, impurity, this, is, the, filth, and, the, impure, seed, of, the, serpent, who, mounted, eve, before, adam, mounted, her, behold, here, it, is, before, you, because, of, the, sins, of, adam, the, first, man, all, the, things, mentioned, came, into, being, for, evil, lilith, when, she, saw, the, greatness, of, his, corruption, became, strong, in, her, husks, and, came, to, adam, against, his, will, and, became, hot, from, him, and, bore, him, many, demons, and, spirits, and, lilin, patai81, 455f, references, to, lilith, in, the, zohar, include, the, following, she, roams, at, night, and, goes, all, about, the, world, and, makes, sport, with, men, and, causes, them, to, emit, seed, in, every, place, where, a, man, sleeps, alone, in, a, house, she, visits, him, and, grabs, him, and, attaches, herself, to, him, and, has, her, desire, from, him, and, bears, from, him, and, she, also, afflicts, him, with, sickness, and, he, knows, it, not, and, all, this, takes, place, when, the, moon, is, on, the, wane, this, passage, may, be, related, to, the, mention, of, lilith, in, talmud, shabbath, 151b, see, above, and, also, to, talmud, eruvin, 18b, where, nocturnal, emissions, are, connected, with, the, begettal, of, demons, according, to, rapahel, patai, older, sources, state, clearly, that, after, lilith, s, red, sea, sojourn, mentioned, also, in, louis, ginzberg, s, legends, of, the, jews, she, returned, to, adam, and, begat, children, from, him, by, forcing, herself, upon, him, before, doing, so, she, attaches, herself, to, cain, and, bears, him, numerous, spirits, and, demons, in, the, zohar, however, lilith, is, said, to, have, succeeded, in, begetting, offspring, from, adam, even, during, their, short, lived, sexual, experience, lilith, leaves, adam, in, eden, as, she, is, not, a, suitable, helpmate, for, him, gershom, scholem, proposes, that, the, author, of, the, zohar, rabbi, moses, de, leon, was, aware, of, both, the, folk, tradition, of, lilith, and, another, conflicting, version, possibly, older, the, zohar, adds, further, that, two, female, spirits, instead, of, one, lilith, and, naamah, desired, adam, and, seduced, him, the, issue, of, these, unions, were, demons, and, spirits, called, the, plagues, of, humankind, and, the, usual, added, explanation, was, that, it, was, through, adam, s, own, sin, that, lilith, overcame, him, against, his, will, a, copy, of, jean, de, pauly, s, translation, of, the, zohar, in, the, ritman, library, contains, an, inserted, late, 17th, century, printed, hebrew, sheet, for, use, in, magical, amulets, where, the, prophet, elijah, confronts, lilith, the, sheet, contains, two, texts, within, borders, which, are, amulets, one, for, a, male, lazakhar, the, other, one, for, a, female, lanekevah, the, invocations, mention, adam, eve, and, lilith, chavah, rishonah, the, first, eve, who, is, identical, with, lilith, also, devils, or, angels, sanoy, sansinoy, smangeluf, shmari, el, the, guardian, and, hasdi, el, the, merciful, a, few, lines, in, yiddish, are, followed, by, the, dialogue, between, the, prophet, elijah, and, lilith, when, he, met, her, with, her, host, of, demons, to, kill, the, mother, and, take, her, new, born, child, to, drink, her, blood, suck, her, bones, and, eat, her, flesh, she, tells, elijah, that, she, will, lose, her, power, if, someone, uses, her, secret, names, which, she, reveals, at, the, end, lilith, abitu, abizu, hakash, avers, hikpodu, ayalu, matrota, in, other, amulets, probably, informed, by, the,

etymological, discussion, of, lullaby, a, note, written, in, a, copy, of, skinner, which, asserts, that, the, word, lullaby, originates, from, lillu, abi, abi, a, hebrew, incantation, meaning, lilith, begone, recited, by, jewish, mothers, over, an, infant, s, cradle, richardson, did, not, endorse, the, theory, and, modern, lexicographers, consider, it, a, false, etymology, not, so, much, an,

protect, her, from, lilith, and, the, evil, eye, which, were, considered, to, represent, the, greatest, danger, for, children, and, pregnant, women, rabbi, naphtali, hirsch, ben, elieser, treves, described, this, custom, as, early, as, 1560, and, later, references, to, a, knife, or, sword, by, the, birthing, bed, by, both, paul, christian, kirchner, and, johann, christian, georg, bodenschatz,

augustine, calmet, lilith, has, connections, with, early, views, on, vampires, and, sorcery, some, learned, men, have, thought, they, discovered, some, vestiges, of, vampirism, in, the, remotest, antiquity, but, all, that, they, say, of, it, does, not, come, near, what, is, related, of, the, vampires, the, lamiae, the, strigae, the, sorcerers, whom, they, accused, of, sucking, the, blood, of, living, people, and, of, thus, causing, their, death, the, magicians, who, were, said, to, cause, the, death, of, new, born, children, by, charms, and, malignant, spells, are, nothing, less, than, what, we, understand, by, the, name, of, vampires, even, were, it, to, be, owned, that, these, lamiae, and, strigae, have, really, existed, which, we, do, not, believe, can, ever, be, well, proved, i, own, that, these, terms, are, found, in, the, versions, of, holy, scripture, for, instance, isaiah, describing, the, condition, to, which, babylon, was, to, be, reduced, after, her, ruin, says, that, she, shall, become, the, abode, of, satyrs, lamiae, and, strigae, in, hebrew, lilith, this, last, term, according, to, the, hebrews, signifies, the, same, thing, as, the, greeks, express, by, strix, and, lamiae, which, are, sorceresses, or, magicians, who, seek, to, put, to, death, new, born, children, whence, it, comes, that, the, jews, are, accustomed, to, write, in, the, four, corners, of, the, chamber, of, a, woman, just, delivered, adam, eve, be, gone, from, hence, lilith, the, ancient, greeks, knew, these, dangerous, sorceresses, by, the, name, of, lamiae, and, they, believed, that, they, devoured, children, or, sucked, away, all, their, blood, till, they, died, according, to, siegmund, hurwitz, the, talmudic, lilith, is, connected, with, the, greek, lamia, who, according, to, hurwitz, likewise, governed, a, class, of, child, stealing, lamia, demons, lamia, bore, the, title, child, killer, and, was, feared, for, her, malevolence, like, lilith, she, has, different, conflicting, origins, and, is, described, as, having, a, human, upper, body, from, the, waist, up, and, a, serpentine, body, from, the, waist, down, one, source, states, simply, that, she, is, a,
