synagogue, is, not, always, necessary, for, jewish, worship, due, to, adaptations, during, times, of, jewish, persecution, in, countries, and, regions, that, banned, judaism, frequently, destroying, and, or, reappropriating, synagogues, into, churches, or, even, government, buildings, halakha, jewish, law, from, the, mishnah, the, oral, torah, states, that, communal, jewish, worship, can, be,

than, ten, people, but, certain, prayers, are, considered, by, halakha, as, solely, communal, these, can, be, recited, only, by, a, minyan, in, terms, of, its, specific, ritual, and, liturgical, functions, the, synagogue, does, not, replace, the, symbol, of, the, long, destroyed, temple, in, jerusalem, any, jew, or, group, of, jews, can, build, a, synagogue, synagogues, have, been, constructed, by, ancient, jewish, leaders, by, wealthy, patrons, as, part, of, a, wide, range, of, human, institutions, including, secular, educational, institutions, governments, and, hotels, by, the, entire, jewish, community, of, living, in, a, particular, village, or, region, or, by, sub, groups, of, jewish, people, arrayed, according, to, occupation, ethnicity, e, g, the, sephardic,

means, assembly, and, is, commonly, used, in, english, with, its, earliest, mention, in, the, 1st, century, theodotos, inscription, in, jerusalem, ashkenazi, jews, have, traditionally, used, the, yiddish, term, shul, from, the, greek, schola, which, is, also, the, source, of, the, english, school, in, everyday, speech, and, many, continue, to, do, so, in, english, sephardi, jews, and,

communal, worship, primarily, revolved, around, the, temple, in, jerusalem, serving, as, a, central, focal, point, and, significant, symbol, for, the, entire, jewish, nation, as, such, it, was, the, destination, for, jews, making, pilgrimages, during, the, three, major, annual, festivals, commanded, by, the, torah, passover, shavuot, and, sukkot, there, are, several, known, cases, of, jewish, communities, in, egypt, with, their, own, temples, such, as, the, temple, at, elephantine, established, by, refugees, from, the, kingdom, of, judah, during, the, twenty, seventh, dynasty, of, egypt, and, a, few, centuries, later, the, temple, of, onias, in, the, heliopolite, nome, the, first, synagogues, emerged, in, the, jewish, diaspora, several, centuries, before, their, introduction, to, the, land, of, israel, evidence, points, to, their, existence, as, early, as, the, hellenistic, period, notably, in, alexandria, ptolemaic, egypt, the, world, s, foremost, greek, speaking, city, at, the, time, there, the, first, proseukh, i, koin, greek, lit, places, of, prayer, singular, proseukh, were, built, to, provide, a, place, for, communal, prayer, and, reading, and, studying, the, torah, alexandrian, jews, also, made, a, koine, greek, translation, of, the, torah, the, septuagint, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, for, the, existence, of, synagogues, is, stone, dedication, inscriptions, from, the, third, century, bce, prove, that, proseukh, i, existed, by, that, date, philo, and, josephus, mention, lavishly, adorned, synagogues, in, alexandria, and, in, antioch, respectively, more, than, a, dozen, second, temple, period, synagogues, in, use, by, jews, and, samaritans, have, been, identified, by, archaeologists, in, israel, and, other, countries, of, the, hellenistic, world, following, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, in, 70, ce, rabbi, yohanan, ben, zakkai, who, is, often, credited, with, reformulating, judaism, for, the, post, temple, era, advocated, for, the, establishment, of, individual, houses, of, worship, since, the, temple, was, no, longer, accessible, it, has, been, theorized, that, the, synagogue, became, a, place, of, worship, in, the, region, upon, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, during, the, first, jewish, roman, war, however, others, speculate, that, there, had, been, places, of, prayer, apart, from, the, temple, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, popularization, of, prayer, over, sacrifice, during, the, years, prior, to, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, in, 70, ce, had, prepared, the, jews, for, life, in, the, diaspora, where, prayer, would, serve, as, the, focus, of, jewish, worship, despite, the, certain, existence, of, synagogue, like, spaces, prior, to, the, first, jewish, roman, war, the, synagogue, emerged, as, a, focal, point, for, jewish, worship, upon, the, destruction, of, the, temple, for, jews, living, in, the, wake, of, the, revolt, the, synagogue, functioned, as, a, portable, system, of, worship, within, the, synagogue, jews, worshipped, by, way, of, prayer, rather, than, sacrifices, which, had, previously, served, as, the, main, form, of, worship, within, the, second, temple, in, 1995, howard, clark, kee, argued, that, synagogues, were, not, a, developed, feature, of, jewish, life, prior, to, the, first, jewish, roman, war, 66, 73, ce, kee, interpreted, his, findings, as, evidence, that, the, mentions, of, synagogues, in, the, new, testament, including, jesus, s, visitations, of, synagogues, in, various, jewish, settlements, in, israel, were, anachronistic, however, by, 2018, mordechai, aviam, reported, that, there, were, now, at, least, nine, synagogues, excavated, known, to, pre, date, the, destruction, of, the, jerusalem, temple, in, 70, ce, including, in, magdala, gamla, masada, herodium, modi, in, kh, umm, el, umdan, qiryat, sepher, kh, bad, issa, and, kh, diab, aviam, concluded, that, he, thought, almost, every, jewish, settlement, at, the, time, whether, it, was, a, polis, or, a, village, had, a, synagogue, during, late, antiquity, third, to, seventh, century, ce, literary, sources, attest, to, the, existence, of, a, large, number, of, synagogues, across, the, roman, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, archaeological, evidence, indicates, the, presence, of, synagogues, in, at, least, thirteen, places, across, the, diaspora, spanning, from, dura, europos, in, syria, to, elche, in, hispania, modern, day, spain, an, especially, sizable, and, monumental, synagogue, dating, from, this, period, is, the, sardis,

in, synagogue, construction, in, galilee, and, golan, in, the, north, and, the, southern, hills, of, judea, in, the, south, each, synagogue, was, constructed, according, to, the, means, and, religious, customs, of, the, local, community, notable, examples, include, capernaum, bar, am, beth, alpha, maoz, haim, meroth, and, nabratein, in, the, north, and, eshtemoa, susya, anim, and, maon, in, the, south, rabbi, and, philosopher, maimonides, 1138, 1204, described, the, various, customs, in, his, day, with, respect, to, local, synagogues, synagogues, and, houses, of, study, must, be, treated, with, respect, they, are, swept, and, sprinkled, to, lay, the, dust, in, spain, and, the, maghreb, in, babylonia, and, in, the, holy, land, it, is, customary, to, kindle, lamps, in, the, synagogues, and, to, spread, mats, on, the, floor, upon, which, the, worshippers, sit, in, the, lands, of, edom, christendom, they, sit, in, synagogues, upon, chairs, the, samaritan, house, of, worship, is, also, called, a, synagogue, during, the, third, and, second, centuries, bce, the, hellenistic, period, the, greek, word, used, in, the, diaspora, by, samaritans, and, jews, was, the, same, proseukh, koin, greek, lit, place, of, prayer, plural, prosukh, i, a, third, or, fourth, century, inscription, uses, a, similar, term, eukt, rion, the, oldest, samaritan, synagogue, discovered, so, far, is, from, delos, in, the, aegean, islands, with, an, inscription, dated, between, 250, and, 175, bce, while, most, samaritan, synagogues, excavated, in, the, wider, land, of, israel, and, ancient, samaria, in, particular, were, built, in, the, fourth, to, seventh, centuries, at, the, very, end, of, the, roman, empire, and, throughout, the, byzantine, period, the, elements, which, distinguish, samaritan, synagogues, from, contemporary, jewish, ones, are, ancient, samaritan, synagogues, are, mentioned, by, literary, sources, or, have, been, found, by, archaeologists, in, the, diaspora, in, the, wider, holy, land, and, specifically, in, samaria, in, the, new, testament, the, word, appears, 56, times, mostly, in, the, synoptic, gospels, but, also, in, the, gospel, of, john, john, 9, 22, 18, 20, and, the, book, of, revelation, rev, 2, 9, 3, 9, it, is, used, in, the, sense, of, assembly, in, the, epistle, of, james, james, 2, 2, alternatively, the, epistle, of, james, in, greek, clearly, or, anglicized, to, jacob, refers, to, a, place, of, assembly, that, was, indeed, jewish, with, jacob, ben, joseph, perhaps, an, elder, there, the, specific, word, in, james, jacob, 2,

literature, as, synagogue, churches, scholars, have, claimed, to, have, identified, such, houses, of, worship, of, the, jews, who, had, accepted, jesus, as, the, messiah, in, jerusalem, and, nazareth, there, is, no, set, blueprint, for, synagogues, and, the, architectural, shapes, and, interior, designs, of, synagogues, vary, greatly, in, fact, the, influence, from, other, local, religious, buildings, can, often, be, seen, in, synagogue, arches, domes, and, towers, historically, synagogues, were, built, in, the, prevailing, architectural, style, of, their, time, and, place, thus, the, synagogue, in, kaifeng, china, looked, very, like, chinese, temples, of, that, region, and, era, with, its, outer, wall, and, open, garden, in, which, several, buildings, were, arranged, the, styles, of, the, earliest, synagogues, resembled, the, temples, of, other, cults, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, the, surviving, synagogues, of, medieval, spain, are, embellished, with, mud, jar, plasterwork, the, surviving, medieval, synagogues, in, budapest, and, prague, are, typical, gothic, structures, with, the, emancipation, of, jews, in, western, european, countries, in, the, 19th, century, which, not, only, enabled, jews, to, enter, fields, of, enterprise, from, which, they, were, formerly, barred, but, gave, them, the, right, to, build, synagogues, without, needing, special, permissions, synagogue, architecture, blossomed, large, jewish, communities, wished, to, show, not, only, their, wealth, but, also, their, newly, acquired, status, as, citizens, by, constructing, magnificent, synagogues, these, were, built, across, western, europe, and, in, the, united, states, in, all, of, the, historicist, or, revival, styles, then, in, fashion, thus, there, were, neoclassical, renaissance, revival, architecture, neo, byzantine, romanesque, revival, moorish, revival, gothic, revival, and, greek, revival, there, are, egyptian, revival, synagogues, and, even, one, mayan, revival, synagogue, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, heyday, of, historicist, architecture, however, most, historicist, synagogues, even, the, most, magnificent, ones, did, not, attempt, a, pure, style, or, even, any, particular, style, and, are, best, described, as, eclectic, in, the, post, war, era, synagogue, architecture, abandoned, historicist, styles, for, modernism, all, synagogues, contain, a, bimah, a, large, raised, reader, s, platform, called, te, ah, reading, dais, by, sephardim, where, the, torah, scroll, is, placed, to, be, read, in, sephardi, synagogues, and, traditional, ashkenazi, synagogues, it, is, also, used, as, the, prayer, leader, s, reading, desk, in, ashkenazi, synagogues, the, torah, was, read, on, a, reader, s, table, located, in, the, center, of, the, room, while, the, leader, of, the, prayer, service, the, hazzan, stood, at, his, own, lectern, or, table, facing, the, ark, in, sephardic, synagogues, the, table, for, reading, the, torah, reading, dais, was, commonly, placed, at, the, opposite, side, of, the, room, from, the, torah, ark, leaving, the, center, of, the, floor, empty, for, the, use, of, a, ceremonial, procession, carrying, the, torah, between, the, ark, and, the, reading, table, most, contemporary, synagogues, feature, a, lectern, for, the, rabbi, the, torah, ark, called, in, hebrew, aron, kodesh, or, holy, chest, and, alternatively, called, the, heikhal, or, temple, by, sephardic, jews, is, a, cabinet, in, which, the, torah, scrolls, are, kept, the, ark, in, a, synagogue, is, almost, always, positioned, in, such, a, way, such, that, those, who, face, it, are, facing, towards, jerusalem, thus, sanctuary, seating, plans, in, the, western, world, generally, face, east, while, those, east, of, israel, face, west, sanctuaries, in, israel, face, towards, jerusalem, occasionally, synagogues, face, other, directions, for, structural, reasons, in, such, cases, some, individuals, might, turn, to, face, jerusalem, when, standing, for, prayers, but, the, congregation, as, a, whole, does, not, the, ark, is, reminiscent, of, the, ark, of, the, covenant, which, held, the, tablets, inscribed, with, the, ten, commandments, this, is, the, holiest, spot, in, a, synagogue, equivalent, to, the, holy, of, holies, the, ark, is, often, closed, with, an, ornate, curtain, the, parochet, which, hangs, outside, or, inside, the, ark, doors, other, traditional, features, include, a, continually, lit, lamp, or, lantern, usually, electric, in, contemporary, synagogues, called, the, ner, tamid, the, eternal, light, used, as, a, way, to, honor, the, divine, presence, a, synagogue, may, be, decorated, with, artwork, but, in, the, rabbinic, and, orthodox, tradition, three, dimensional, sculptures, and, depictions, of, the, human, body, are, not, allowed, as, these, are, considered, akin, to, idolatry, originally, synagogues, were, made, devoid, of, much, furniture, the, jewish, congregants, in, spain, the, maghreb, north, africa, babylonia, the, land, of, israel, and, yemen, having, a, custom, to, sit, upon, the, floor, which, had, been, strewn, with, mats, and, cushions, rather, than, upon, chairs, or, benches, in, other, european, towns, and, cities, however, jewish, congregants, would, sit, upon, chairs, and, benches, today, the, custom, has, spread, in, all, places, to, sit, upon, chairs, and, benches, until, the, 19th, century, in, an, ashkenazi, synagogue, all, seats, most, often, faced, the, torah, ark, in, a, sephardic, synagogue, seats, were, usually, arranged, around, the, perimeter, of, the, sanctuary, but, when, the, worshipers, stood, up, to, pray, everyone, faced, the, ark, many, current, synagogues, have, an, elaborate, chair, named, for, the, prophet, elijah, which, is, only, sat, upon, during, the, ceremony, of, brit, milah, in, ancient, synagogues, a, special, chair, placed, on, the, wall, facing, jerusalem, and, next, to, the, torah, shrine, was, reserved, for, the, prominent, members, of, the, congregation, and, for, important, guests, such, a, stone, carved, and, inscribed, seat, was, discovered, at, archaeological, excavations, in, the, synagogue, at, chorazin, in, galilee, and, dates, from, the, 4th, 6th, century, another, one, was, discovered, at, the, delos, synagogue, complete, with, a, footstool, in, yemen, the, jewish, custom, was, to, remove, one, s, shoes, immediately, prior, to, entering, the, synagogue, a, custom, that, had, been, observed, by, jews, in, other, places, in, earlier, times, the, same, practice, of, removing, one, s, shoes, before, entering, the, synagogue, was, also, largely, observed, among, jews, in, morocco, in, the, early, 20th, century, on, the, island, of, djerba, in, tunisia, jews, still, remove, their, shoes, when, entering, a, synagogue, the, custom, of, removing, one, s, shoes, is, no, longer, practiced, in, israel, the, united, kingdom, or, the, united, states, and, which, custom, as, in, former, times, was, dependent, upon, whether, or, not, the, wearer, considered, it, a, thing, of, contempt, to, stand, before, god, while, wearing, shoes, in, christian, countries, where, it, was, thought, not, offensive, to, stand, before, a, king, while, wearing, shoes, it, was, likewise, permitted, to, do, so, in, a, house, of, prayer, however, in, karaite, judaism, the, custom, of, removing, one, s, shoes, prior, to, entering, a, synagogue, is, still, observed, worldwide, in, orthodox, synagogues, men, and, women, do, not, sit, together, the, synagogue, features, a, partition, mechitza, dividing, the, men, s, and, women, s, seating, areas, or, a, separate, women, s, section, located, on, a, balcony, the, german, jewish, reform, movement, which, arose, in, the, early, 19th, century, made, many, changes, to, the, traditional, look, of, the, synagogue, keeping, with, its, desire, to, simultaneously, stay, jewish, yet, be, accepted, by, the, surrounding, culture, the, first, reform, synagogue, which, opened, in, hamburg, in, 1811, introduced, changes, that, made, the, synagogue, look, more, like, a, church, these, included, the, installation, of, an, organ, to, accompany, the, prayers, even, on, shabbat, when, musical, instruments, are, proscribed, by, halakha, a, choir, to, accompany, the, hazzan, and, vestments, for, the, synagogue, rabbi, to, wear, in, following, decades, the, central, reader, s, table, the, bimah, was, moved, to, the, front, of, the, reform, sanctuary, previously, unheard, of, in, orthodox, synagogues, gender, separation, was, also, removed, synagogues, often, take, on, a, broader, role, in, modern, jewish, communities, and, may, include, additional, facilities, such, as, a, catering, hall, kosher, kitchen, religious, school, library, day, care, center, and, a, smaller, chapel, for, daily, services, since, many, orthodox, and, some, non, orthodox, jews, prefer, to, collect, a, minyan, a, quorum, of, ten, rather, than, pray, alone, they, commonly, assemble, at, pre, arranged, times, in, offices, living, rooms, or, other, spaces, when, these, are, more, convenient, than, formal, synagogue, buildings, a, room, or, building, that, is, used, this, way, can, become, a, dedicated, small, synagogue, or, prayer, room, among, ashkenazi, jews, they, are, traditionally, called, shtiebel, pl, shtiebelekh, or, shtiebels, yiddish, for, little, house, and, are, found, in, orthodox, communities, worldwide, another, type, of, communal, prayer, group, favored, by, some,
