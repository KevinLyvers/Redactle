judaism, hebrew, romanized, yah, is, an, abrahamic, monotheistic, ethnic, religion, that, comprises, the, collective, spiritual, cultural, and, legal, traditions, of, the, jewish, people, judaism, evolved, from, yahwism, an, ancient, semitic, religion, of, the, late, bronze, age, to, early, iron, age, likely, around, the, 6th, 5th, century, bce, along, with, samaritanism, to, which, it, is, closely, related, judaism, is, one, of, the, two, oldest, abrahamic, religions, religious, jews, regard, judaism, as, their, means, of, observing, the, mosaic, covenant, which, was, established, between, god, and, the, israelites, their, ancestors, jewish, religious, doctrine, encompasses, a, wide, body, of, texts, practices, theological, positions, and, forms, of, organization, among, judaism, s, core, texts, is, the, torah, the, first, five, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, a, collection, of, ancient, hebrew, scriptures, the, tanakh, known, in, english, as, the, hebrew, bible, is, also, referred, to, as, the, old, testament, in, christianity, in, addition, to, the, original, written, scripture, the, supplemental, oral, torah, is, represented, by, later, texts, such, as, the, midrash, and, the, talmud, the, hebrew, language, word, torah, can, mean, teaching, law, or, instruction, although, torah, can, also, be, used, as, a, general, term, that, refers, to, any, jewish, text, that, expands, or, elaborates, on, the, original, five, books, of, moses, representing, the, core, of, the, jewish, spiritual, and, religious, tradition, the, torah, is, a, term, and, a, set, of, teachings, that, are, explicitly, self, positioned, as, encompassing, at, least, seventy, and, potentially, infinite, facets, and, interpretations, judaism, s, texts, traditions, and, values, strongly, influenced, later, abrahamic, religions, including, christianity, and, islam, hebraism, like, hellenism, played, a, seminal, role, in, the, formation, of, western, civilization, through, its, impact, as, a, core, background, element, of, early, christianity, within, judaism, there, are, a, variety, of, religious, movements, most, of, which, emerged, from, rabbinic, judaism, which, holds, that, god, revealed, his, laws, and, commandments, to, moses, on, mount, sinai, in, the, form, of, both, the, written, and, oral, torah, historically, all, or, part, of, this, assertion, was, challenged, by, various, groups, such, as, the, sadducees, and, hellenistic, judaism, during, the, second, temple, period, the, karaites, during, the, early, and, later, medieval, period, and, among, segments, of, the, modern, non, orthodox, denominations, some, modern, branches, of, judaism, such, as, humanistic, judaism, may, be, considered, secular, or, nontheistic, today, the, largest, jewish, religious, movements, are, orthodox, judaism, haredi, and, modern, orthodox, conservative, judaism, and, reform, judaism, major, sources, of, difference, between, these, groups, are, their, approaches, to, halakha, jewish, law, the, authority, of, the, rabbinic, tradition, and, the, significance, of, the, state, of, israel, orthodox, judaism, maintains, that, the, torah, and, halakha, are, divine, in, origin, eternal, and, unalterable, and, that, they, should, be, strictly, followed, conservative, and, reform, judaism, are, more, liberal, with, conservative, judaism, generally, promoting, a, more, traditionalist, interpretation, of, judaism, s, requirements, than, reform, judaism, a, typical, reform, position, is, that, halakha, should, be, viewed, as, a, set, of, general, guidelines, rather, than, as, a, set, of, restrictions, and, obligations, whose, observance, is, required, of, all, jews, historically, special, courts, enforced, halakha, today, these, courts, still, exist, but, the, practice, of, judaism, is, mostly, voluntary, authority, on, theological, and, legal, matters, is, not, vested, in, any, one, person, or, organization, but, in, the, sacred, texts, and, the, rabbis, and, scholars, who, interpret, them, jews, are, an, ethnoreligious, group, including, those, born, jewish, or, ethnic, jews, in, addition, to, converts, to, judaism, in, 2021, the, world, jewish, population, was, estimated, at, 15, 2, million, or, roughly, 0, 195, of, the, total, world, population, although, religious, observance, varies, from, strict, to, none, in, 2021, about, 45, 6, of, all, jews, resided, in, israel, and, another, 42, 1, resided, in, the, united, states, and, canada, with, most, of, the, remainder, living, in, europe, and, other, groups, spread, throughout, latin, america, asia, africa, and, australia, the, term, judaism, derives, from, iudaismus, a, latinized, form, of, the, ancient, greek, ioudaismos, from, the, verb, to, side, with, or, imitate, the, its, ultimate, source, was, the, hebrew, yehudah, judah, which, is, also, the, source, of, the, hebrew, term, for, judaism, yahadut, the, term, first, appears, in, the, hellenistic, greek, book, of, 2, maccabees, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, i, e, 2, maccabees, 2, 21, 8, 1, and, 14, 38, in, the, context, of, the, age, and, period, it, meant, seeking, or, forming, part, of, a, cultural, entity, and, it, resembled, its, antonym, hellenismos, a, word, that, signified, a, people, s, submission, to, hellenic, greek, cultural, norms, the, conflict, between, iudaismos, and, hellenismos, lay, behind, the, maccabean, revolt, and, hence, the, invention, of, the, term, iudaismos, shaye, j, d, cohen, writes, in, his, book, the, beginnings, of, jewishness, we, are, tempted, of, course, to, translate, as, judaism, but, this, translation, is, too, narrow, because, in, this, first, occurrence, of, the, term, iouda, sm, s, has, not, yet, been, reduced, to, the, designation, of, a, religion, it, means, rather, the, aggregate, of, all, those, characteristics, that, makes, judaeans, judaean, or, jews, jewish, among, these, characteristics, to, be, sure, are, practices, and, beliefs, that, we, would, today, call, religious, but, these, practices, and, beliefs, are, not, the, sole, content, of, the, term, thus, iouda, sm, s, should, be, translated, not, as, judaism, but, as, judaeanness, daniel, r, schwartz, however, argues, that, judaism, especially, in, the, context, of, the, book, of, maccabees, refers, to, the, religion, as, opposed, to, the, culture, and, politics, of, the, judean, state, he, believes, it, reflected, the, ideological, divide, between, the, pharisees, and, sadducees, and, implicitly, anti, hasmonean, and, pro, hasmonean, factions, in, judean, society, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, earliest, citation, in, english, where, the, term, was, used, to, mean, the, profession, or, practice, of, the, jewish, religion, the, religious, system, or, polity, of, the, jews, is, robert, fabyan, s, the, newe, cronycles, of, englande, and, of, fraunce, 1516, judaism, as, a, direct, translation, of, the, latin, iudaismus, first, occurred, in, a, 1611, english, translation, of, the, apocrypha, deuterocanon, in, catholic, and, eastern, orthodoxy, 2, macc, ii, 21, those, that, behaved, themselves, manfully, to, their, honour, for, iudaisme, at, its, core, the, hebrew, bible, tanakh, is, an, account, of, the, israelites, relationship, with, god, from, their, earliest, history, until, the, building, of, the, second, temple, c, 535, bce, abraham, is, hailed, as, the, first, hebrew, and, the, father, of, the, jewish, people, as, a, reward, for, his, act, of, faith, in, one, god, he, was, promised, that, isaac, his, second, son, would, inherit, the, land, of, israel, then, called, canaan, later, the, descendants, of, isaac, s, son, jacob, were, enslaved, in, egypt, and, god, commanded, moses, to, lead, the, exodus, from, egypt, at, mount, sinai, they, received, the, torah, the, five, books, of, moses, these, books, together, with, nevi, im, and, ketuvim, are, known, as, torah, shebikhtav, as, opposed, to, the, oral, torah, which, refers, to, the, mishnah, and, the, talmud, eventually, god, led, them, to, the, land, of, israel, where, the, tabernacle, was, planted, in, the, city, of, shiloh, for, over, 300, years, to, rally, the, nation, against, attacking, enemies, as, time, went, on, the, spiritual, level, of, the, nation, declined, to, the, point, that, god, allowed, the, philistines, to, capture, the, tabernacle, the, people, of, israel, then, told, samuel, the, prophet, that, they, needed, to, be, governed, by, a, permanent, king, and, samuel, appointed, saul, to, be, their, king, when, the, people, pressured, saul, into, going, against, a, command, conveyed, to, him, by, samuel, god, told, samuel, to, appoint, david, in, his, stead, rabbinic, tradition, holds, that, the, details, and, interpretation, of, the, law, which, are, called, the, oral, torah, or, oral, law, were, originally, an, unwritten, tradition, based, upon, what, god, told, moses, on, mount, sinai, however, as, the, persecutions, of, the, jews, increased, and, the, details, were, in, danger, of, being, forgotten, these, oral, laws, were, recorded, by, rabbi, judah, hanasi, judah, the, prince, in, the, mishnah, redacted, circa, 200, ce, the, talmud, was, a, compilation, of, both, the, mishnah, and, the, gemara, rabbinic, commentaries, redacted, over, the, next, three, centuries, the, gemara, originated, in, two, major, centers, of, jewish, scholarship, palestine, and, babylonia, correspondingly, two, bodies, of, analysis, developed, and, two, works, of, talmud, were, created, the, older, compilation, is, called, the, jerusalem, talmud, it, was, compiled, sometime, during, the, 4th, century, in, palestine, according, to, critical, scholars, the, torah, consists, of, inconsistent, texts, edited, together, in, a, way, that, calls, attention, to, divergent, accounts, several, of, these, scholars, such, as, professor, martin, rose, and, john, bright, suggest, that, during, the, first, temple, period, the, people, of, israel, believed, that, each, nation, had, its, own, god, but, that, their, god, was, superior, to, other, gods, some, suggest, that, strict, monotheism, developed, during, the, babylonian, exile, perhaps, in, reaction, to, zoroastrian, dualism, in, this, view, it, was, only, by, the, hellenic, period, that, most, jews, came, to, believe, that, their, god, was, the, only, god, and, that, the, notion, of, a, clearly, bounded, jewish, nation, identical, with, the, jewish, religion, formed, john, day, argues, that, the, origins, of, biblical, yahweh, el, asherah, and, ba, al, may, be, rooted, in, earlier, canaanite, religion, which, was, centered, on, a, pantheon, of, gods, much, like, the, greek, pantheon, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, a, united, monarchy, was, established, under, saul, and, continued, under, king, david, and, solomon, with, its, capital, in, jerusalem, after, solomon, s, reign, the, nation, split, into, two, kingdoms, the, kingdom, of, israel, in, the, north, and, the, kingdom, of, judah, in, the, south, the, kingdom, of, israel, was, destroyed, around, 720, bce, when, it, was, conquered, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, many, people, were, taken, captive, from, the, capital, samaria, to, media, and, the, khabur, river, valley, the, kingdom, of, judah, continued, as, an, independent, state, until, it, was, conquered, by, nebuchadnezzar, ii, of, the, neo, babylonian, empire, in, 586, bce, the, babylonians, destroyed, jerusalem, and, the, first, temple, which, was, at, the, center, of, ancient, jewish, worship, the, judeans, were, exiled, to, babylon, in, what, is, regarded, as, the, first, jewish, diaspora, later, many, of, them, returned, to, their, homeland, after, the, subsequent, conquest, of, babylon, by, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, seventy, years, later, an, event, known, as, the, return, to, zion, a, second, temple, was, constructed, and, old, religious, practices, were, resumed, during, the, early, years, of, the, second, temple, the, highest, religious, authority, was, a, council, known, as, the, great, assembly, led, by, ezra, the, scribe, among, other, accomplishments, of, the, great, assembly, the, last, books, of, the, bible, were, written, at, this, time, and, the, canon, sealed, hellenistic, judaism, spread, to, ptolemaic, egypt, from, the, 3rd, century, bce, and, its, creation, sparked, widespread, controversy, in, jewish, communities, starting, conflicts, within, jewish, communities, about, accommodating, the, cultures, of, occupying, powers, during, the, great, jewish, revolt, 66, 73, ce, the, romans, sacked, jerusalem, and, destroyed, the, second, temple, later, roman, emperor, hadrian, built, a, pagan, idol, on, the, temple, mount, and, prohibited, circumcision, these, acts, of, ethnocide, provoked, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, 132, 136, ce, after, which, the, romans, banned, the, study, of, the, torah, and, the, celebration, of, jewish, holidays, and, forcibly, removed, virtually, all, jews, from, judea, in, 200, ce, however, jews, were, granted, roman, citizenship, and, judaism, was, recognized, as, a, religio, licita, legitimate, religion, until, the, rise, of, gnosticism, and, early, christianity, in, the, fourth, century, following, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, and, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, jewish, worship, stopped, being, centrally, organized, around, the, temple, prayer, took, the, place, of, sacrifice, and, worship, was, rebuilt, around, the, community, represented, by, a, minimum, of, ten, adult, men, and, the, establishment, of, the, authority, of, rabbis, who, acted, as, teachers, and, leaders, of, individual, communities, unlike, other, ancient, near, eastern, gods, the, hebrew, god, is, portrayed, as, unitary, and, solitary, consequently, the, hebrew, god, s, principal, relationships, are, not, with, other, gods, but, with, the, world, and, more, specifically, with, the, people, he, created, judaism, thus, begins, with, ethical, monotheism, the, belief, that, god, is, one, and, is, concerned, with, the, actions, of, mankind, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, god, promised, abraham, to, make, of, his, offspring, a, great, nation, many, generations, later, he, commanded, the, nation, of, israel, to, love, and, worship, only, one, god, that, is, the, jewish, nation, is, to, reciprocate, god, s, concern, for, the, world, he, also, commanded, the, jewish, people, to, love, one, another, that, is, jews, are, to, imitate, god, s, love, for, people, thus, although, there, is, an, esoteric, tradition, in, judaism, in, kabbalah, rabbinic, scholar, max, kadushin, has, characterized, normative, judaism, as, normal, mysticism, because, it, involves, everyday, personal, experiences, of, god, through, ways, or, modes, that, are, common, to, all, jews, this, is, played, out, through, the, observance, of, the, halakha, or, jewish, law, and, given, verbal, expression, in, the, birkat, ha, mizvot, the, short, blessings, that, are, spoken, every, time, a, positive, commandment, is, to, be, fulfilled, the, ordinary, familiar, everyday, things, and, occurrences, we, have, constitute, occasions, for, the, experience, of, god, such, things, as, one, s, daily, sustenance, the, very, day, itself, are, felt, as, manifestations, of, god, s, loving, kindness, calling, for, the, berakhot, kedushah, holiness, which, is, nothing, else, than, the, imitation, of, god, is, concerned, with, daily, conduct, with, being, gracious, and, merciful, with, keeping, oneself, from, defilement, by, idolatry, adultery, and, the, shedding, of, blood, the, birkat, ha, mitzwot, evokes, the, consciousness, of, holiness, at, a, rabbinic, rite, but, the, objects, employed, in, the, majority, of, these, rites, are, non, holy, and, of, general, character, while, the, several, holy, objects, are, non, theurgic, and, not, only, do, ordinary, things, and, occurrences, bring, with, them, the, experience, of, god, everything, that, happens, to, a, man, evokes, that, experience, evil, as, well, as, good, for, a, berakah, is, said, also, at, evil, tidings, hence, although, the, experience, of, god, is, like, none, other, the, occasions, for, experiencing, him, for, having, a, consciousness, of, him, are, manifold, even, if, we, consider, only, those, that, call, for, berakot, whereas, jewish, philosophers, often, debate, whether, god, is, immanent, or, transcendent, and, whether, people, have, free, will, or, their, lives, are, determined, halakha, is, a, system, through, which, any, jew, acts, to, bring, god, into, the, world, ethical, monotheism, is, central, in, all, sacred, or, normative, texts, of, judaism, however, monotheism, has, not, always, been, followed, in, practice, the, hebrew, bible, or, tanakh, records, and, repeatedly, condemns, the, widespread, worship, of, other, gods, in, ancient, israel, in, the, greco, roman, era, many, different, interpretations, of, monotheism, existed, in, judaism, including, the, interpretations, that, gave, rise, to, christianity, moreover, some, have, argued, that, judaism, is, a, non, creedal, religion, that, does, not, require, one, to, believe, in, god, for, some, observance, of, halakha, is, more, important, than, belief, in, god, per, se, the, debate, about, whether, one, can, speak, of, authentic, or, normative, judaism, is, not, only, a, debate, among, religious, jews, but, also, among, historians, in, continental, europe, judaism, is, heavily, associated, with, and, most, often, thought, of, as, orthodox, judaism, 13, principles, of, faith, maimonides, in, the, strict, sense, in, judaism, unlike, christianity, and, islam, there, are, no, fixed, universally, binding, articles, of, faith, due, to, their, incorporation, into, the, liturgy, scholars, throughout, jewish, history, have, proposed, numerous, formulations, of, judaism, s, core, tenets, all, of, which, have, met, with, criticism, the, most, popular, formulation, is, maimonides, thirteen, principles, of, faith, developed, in, the, 12th, century, according, to, maimonides, any, jew, who, rejects, even, one, of, these, principles, would, be, considered, an, apostate, and, a, heretic, jewish, scholars, have, held, points, of, view, diverging, in, various, ways, from, maimonides, principles, thus, within, reform, judaism, only, the, first, five, principles, are, endorsed, in, maimonides, time, his, list, of, tenets, was, criticized, by, hasdai, crescas, and, joseph, albo, albo, and, the, raavad, argued, that, maimonides, principles, contained, too, many, items, that, while, true, were, not, fundamentals, of, the, faith, along, these, lines, the, ancient, historian, josephus, emphasized, practices, and, observances, rather, than, religious, beliefs, associating, apostasy, with, a, failure, to, observe, halakha, and, maintaining, that, the, requirements, for, conversion, to, judaism, included, circumcision, and, adherence, to, traditional, customs, maimonides, principles, were, largely, ignored, over, the, next, few, centuries, later, two, poetic, restatements, of, these, principles, ani, ma, amin, and, yigdal, became, integrated, into, many, jewish, liturgies, leading, to, their, eventual, near, universal, acceptance, the, oldest, non, rabbinic, instance, of, articles, of, faith, were, formulated, under, islamic, influence, by, the, 12th, century, karaite, figure, judah, ben, elijah, hadassi, 1, god, is, the, creator, of, all, created, beings, 2, he, is, premundane, and, has, no, peer, or, associate, 3, the, whole, universe, is, created, 4, god, called, moses, and, the, other, prophets, of, the, biblical, canon, 5, the, law, of, moses, alone, is, true, 6, to, know, the, language, of, the, bible, is, a, religious, duty, 7, the, temple, at, jerusalem, is, the, palace, of, the, world, s, ruler, 8, belief, in, resurrection, contemporaneous, with, the, advent, of, the, messiah, 9, final, judgment, 10, retribution, in, modern, times, judaism, lacks, a, centralized, authority, that, would, dictate, an, exact, religious, dogma, because, of, this, many, different, variations, on, the, basic, beliefs, are, considered, within, the, scope, of, judaism, even, so, all, jewish, religious, movements, are, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, based, on, the, principles, of, the, hebrew, bible, or, various, commentaries, such, as, the, talmud, and, midrash, judaism, also, universally, recognizes, the, biblical, covenant, between, god, and, the, patriarch, abraham, as, well, as, the, additional, aspects, of, the, covenant, revealed, to, moses, who, is, considered, judaism, s, greatest, prophet, in, the, mishnah, a, core, text, of, rabbinic, judaism, acceptance, of, the, divine, origins, of, this, covenant, is, considered, an, essential, aspect, of, judaism, and, those, who, reject, the, covenant, forfeit, their, share, in, the, world, to, come, establishing, the, core, tenets, of, judaism, in, the, modern, era, is, even, more, difficult, given, the, number, and, diversity, of, the, contemporary, jewish, denominations, even, if, to, restrict, the, problem, to, the, most, influential, intellectual, trends, of, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, century, the, matter, remains, complicated, thus, for, instance, joseph, soloveitchik, s, associated, with, the, modern, orthodox, movement, answer, to, modernity, is, constituted, upon, the, identification, of, judaism, with, following, the, halakha, whereas, its, ultimate, goal, is, to, bring, the, holiness, down, to, the, world, mordecai, kaplan, the, founder, of, the, reconstructionist, judaism, abandons, the, idea, of, religion, for, the, sake, of, identifying, judaism, with, civilization, and, by, means, of, the, latter, term, and, secular, translation, of, the, core, ideas, he, tries, to, embrace, as, many, jewish, denominations, as, possible, in, turn, solomon, schechter, s, conservative, judaism, was, identical, with, the, tradition, understood, as, the, interpretation, of, torah, in, itself, being, the, history, of, the, constant, updates, and, adjustment, of, the, law, performed, by, means, of, the, creative, interpretation, finally, david, philipson, draws, the, outlines, of, the, reform, movement, in, judaism, by, opposing, it, to, the, strict, and, traditional, rabbinical, approach, and, thus, comes, to, the, conclusions, similar, to, that, of, the, conservative, movement, the, following, is, a, basic, structured, list, of, the, central, works, of, jewish, practice, and, thought, the, basis, of, halakha, and, tradition, is, the, torah, also, known, as, the, pentateuch, or, the, five, books, of, moses, according, to, rabbinic, tradition, there, are, 613, commandments, in, the, torah, some, of, these, laws, are, directed, only, to, men, or, to, women, some, only, to, the, ancient, priestly, groups, the, kohanim, and, leviyim, members, of, the, tribe, of, levi, some, only, to, farmers, within, the, land, of, israel, many, laws, were, only, applicable, when, the, temple, in, jerusalem, existed, and, only, 369, of, these, commandments, are, still, applicable, today, while, there, have, been, jewish, groups, whose, beliefs, were, based, on, the, written, text, of, the, torah, alone, e, g, the, sadducees, and, the, karaites, most, jews, believe, in, the, oral, law, these, oral, traditions, were, transmitted, by, the, pharisee, school, of, thought, of, ancient, judaism, and, were, later, recorded, in, written, form, and, expanded, upon, by, the, rabbis, according, to, rabbinical, jewish, tradition, god, gave, both, the, written, law, the, torah, and, the, oral, torah, to, moses, on, mount, sinai, the, oral, law, is, the, oral, tradition, as, relayed, by, god, to, moses, and, from, him, transmitted, and, taught, to, the, sages, rabbinic, leaders, of, each, subsequent, generation, for, centuries, the, torah, appeared, only, as, a, written, text, transmitted, in, parallel, with, the, oral, tradition, fearing, that, the, oral, teachings, might, be, forgotten, rabbi, judah, hanasi, undertook, the, mission, of, consolidating, the, various, opinions, into, one, body, of, law, which, became, known, as, the, mishnah, the, mishnah, consists, of, 63, tractates, codifying, halakha, which, are, the, basis, of, the, talmud, according, to, abraham, ben, david, the, mishnah, was, compiled, by, rabbi, judah, hanasi, after, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, in, anno, mundi, 3949, which, corresponds, to, 189, ce, over, the, next, four, centuries, the, mishnah, underwent, discussion, and, debate, in, both, of, the, world, s, major, jewish, communities, in, israel, and, babylonia, the, commentaries, from, each, of, these, communities, were, eventually, compiled, into, the, two, talmuds, the, jerusalem, talmud, talmud, yerushalmi, and, the, babylonian, talmud, talmud, bavli, these, have, been, further, expounded, by, commentaries, of, various, torah, scholars, during, the, ages, in, the, text, of, the, torah, many, words, are, left, undefined, and, many, procedures, are, mentioned, without, explanation, or, instructions, such, phenomena, are, sometimes, offered, to, validate, the, viewpoint, that, the, written, law, has, always,

rabbinic, jewish, way, of, life, then, is, based, on, a, combined, reading, of, the, torah, and, the, oral, tradition, the, mishnah, the, halakhic, midrash, the, talmud, and, its, commentaries, the, halakha, has, developed, slowly, through, a, precedent, based, system, the, literature, of, questions, to, rabbis, and, their, considered, answers, is, referred, to, as, responsa, hebrew, sheelot, u, teshuvot, over, time, as, practices, develop, codes, of, halakha, are, written, that, are, based, on, the, responsa, the, most, important, code, the, shulchan, aruch, largely, determines, orthodox, religious, practice, today, jewish, philosophy, refers, to, the, conjunction, between, serious, study, of, philosophy, and, jewish, theology, major, jewish, philosophers, include, philo, of,

leading, to, the, post, enlightenment, jewish, philosophers, modern, jewish, philosophy, consists, of, both, orthodox, and, non, orthodox, oriented, philosophy, notable, among, orthodox, jewish, philosophers, are, eliyahu, eliezer, dessler, joseph, b, soloveitchik, and, yitzchok, hutner, well, known, non, orthodox, jewish, philosophers, include, martin, buber, franz, rosenzweig, mordecai, kaplan, abraham, joshua, heschel, will, herberg, and, emmanuel, l, vinas, 13, principles, of, hermeneutics, r, ishmael, orthodox, and, many, other, jews, do, not, believe, that, the, revealed, torah, consists, solely, of, its, written, contents, but, of, its, interpretations, as, well, the, study, of, torah, in, its, widest, sense, to, include, both, poetry, narrative, and, law, and, both, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, talmud, is, in, judaism, itself, a, sacred, act, of, central, importance, for, the, sages, of, the, mishnah, and, talmud, and, for, their, successors, today, the, study, of, torah, was, therefore, not, merely, a, means, to, learn, the, contents, of, god, s, revelation, but, an, end, in, itself, according, to, the, talmud, these, are, the, things, for, which, a, person, enjoys, the, dividends, in, this, world, while, the, principal, remains, for, the, person, to, enjoy, in, the, world, to, come, they, are, honoring, parents, loving, deeds, of, kindness, and, making, peace, between, one, person, and, another, but, the, study, of, the, torah, is, equal, to, them, all, talmud, shabbat, 127a, in, judaism, the, study, of, torah, can, be, a, means, of, experiencing, god, reflecting, on, the, contribution, of, the, amoraim, and, tanaim, to, contemporary, judaism, professor, jacob, neusner, observed, the, rabbi, s, logical, and, rational, inquiry, is, not, mere, logic, chopping, it, is, a, most, serious, and, substantive, effort, to, locate, in, trivialities, the, fundamental, principles, of, the, revealed, will, of, god, to, guide, and, sanctify, the, most, specific, and, concrete, actions, in, the, workaday, world, here, is, the, mystery, of, talmudic, judaism, the, alien, and, remote, conviction, that, the, intellect, is, an, instrument, not, of, unbelief, and, desacralization, but, of, sanctification, to, study, the, written, torah, and, the, oral, torah, in, light, of, each, other, is, thus, also, to, study, how, to, study, the, word, of, god, in, the, study, of, torah, the, sages, formulated, and, followed, various, logical, and, hermeneutical, principles, according, to, david, stern, all, rabbinic, hermeneutics, rest, on, two, basic, axioms, first, the, belief, in, the, omni, significance, of, scripture, in, the, meaningfulness, of, its, every, word, letter, even, according, to, one, famous, report, scribal, flourish, second, the, claim, of, the, essential, unity, of, scripture, as, the, expression, of, the, single, divine, will, these, two, principles, make, possible, a, great, variety, of, interpretations, according, to, the, talmud, a, single, verse, has, several, meanings, but, no, two, verses, hold, the, same, meaning, it, was, taught, in, the, school, of, r, ishmael, behold, my, word, is, like, fire, declares, the, lord, and, like, a, hammer, that, shatters, rock, jer, 23, 29, just, as, this, hammer, produces, many, sparks, when, it, strikes, the, rock, so, a, single, verse, has, several, meanings, talmud, sanhedrin, 34a, observant, jews, thus, view, the, torah, as, dynamic, because, it, contains, within, it, a, host, of, interpretations, according, to, rabbinic, tradition, all, valid, interpretations, of, the, written, torah, were, revealed, to, moses, at, sinai, in, oral, form, and, handed, down, from, teacher, to, pupil, the, oral, revelation, is, in, effect, coextensive, with, the, talmud, itself, when, different, rabbis, forwarded, conflicting, interpretations, they, sometimes, appealed, to, hermeneutic, principles, to, legitimize, their, arguments, some, rabbis, claim, that, these, principles, were, themselves, revealed, by, god, to, moses, at, sinai, thus, hillel, called, attention, to, seven, commonly, used, hermeneutical, principles, in, the, interpretation, of, laws, baraita, at, the, beginning, of, sifra, r, ishmael, thirteen, baraita, at, the, beginning, of, sifra, this, collection, is, largely, an, amplification, of, that, of, hillel, eliezer, b, jose, ha, gelili, listed, 32, largely, used, for, the, exegesis, of, narrative, elements, of, torah, all, the, hermeneutic, rules, scattered, through, the, talmudim, and, midrashim, have, been, collected, by, malbim, in, ayyelet, ha, shachar, the, introduction, to, his, commentary, on, the, sifra, nevertheless, r, ishmael, s, 13, principles, are, perhaps, the, ones, most, widely, known, they, constitute, an, important, and, one, of, judaism, s, earliest, contributions, to, logic, hermeneutics, and, jurisprudence, judah, hadassi, incorporated, ishmael, s, principles, into, karaite, judaism, in, the, 12th, century, today, r, ishmael, s, 13, principles, are, incorporated, into, the, jewish, prayer, book, to, be, read, by, observant, jews, on, a, daily, basis, according, to, daniel, boyarin, the, underlying, distinction, between, religion, and, ethnicity, is, foreign, to, judaism, itself, and, is, one, form, of, the, dualism, between, spirit, and, flesh, that, has, its, origin, in, platonic, philosophy, and, that, permeated, hellenistic, judaism, consequently, in, his, view, judaism, does, not, fit, easily, into, conventional, western, categories, such, as, religion, ethnicity, or, culture, boyarin, suggests, that, this, in, part, reflects, the, fact, that, much, of, judaism, s, more, than, 3, 000, year, history, predates, the, rise, of, western, culture, and, occurred, outside, the, west, that, is, europe, particularly, medieval, and, modern, europe, during, this, time, jews, experienced, slavery, anarchic, and, theocratic, self, government, conquest, occupation, and, exile, in, the, jewish, diaspora, they, were, in, contact, with, and, influenced, by, ancient, egyptian, babylonian, persian, and, hellenic, cultures, as, well, as, modern, movements, such, as, the, enlightenment, see, haskalah, and, the, rise, of, nationalism, which, would, bear, fruit, in, the, form, of, a, jewish, state, in, their, ancient, homeland, the, land, of, israel, thus, boyarin, has, argued, that, jewishness, disrupts, the, very, categories, of, identity, because, it, is, not, national, not, genealogical, not, religious, but, all, of, these, in, dialectical, tension, in, contrast, to, this, point, of, view, practices, such, as, humanistic, judaism, reject, the, religious, aspects, of, judaism, while, retaining, certain, cultural, traditions, according, to, rabbinic, judaism, a, jew, is, anyone, who, was, either, born, of, a, jewish, mother, or, who, converted, to, judaism, in, accordance, with, halakha, reconstructionist, judaism, and, the, larger, denominations, of, worldwide, progressive, judaism, also, known, as, liberal, or, reform, judaism, accept, the, child, as, jewish, if, one, of, the, parents, is, jewish, if, the, parents, raise, the, child, with, a, jewish, identity, but, not, the, smaller, regional, branches, all, mainstream, forms, of, judaism, today, are, open, to, sincere, converts, although, conversion, has, traditionally, been, discouraged, since, the, time, of, the, talmud, the, conversion, process, is, evaluated, by, an, authority, and, the, convert, is, examined, on, his, or, her, sincerity, and, knowledge, converts, are, called, ben, abraham, or, bat, abraham, son, or, daughter, of, abraham, conversions, have, on, occasion, been, overturned, in, 2008, israel, s, highest, religious, court, invalidated, the, conversion, of, 40, 000, jews, mostly, from, russian, immigrant, families, even, though, they, had, been, approved, by, an, orthodox, rabbi, rabbinical, judaism, maintains, that, a, jew, whether, by, birth, or, conversion, is, a, jew, forever, thus, a, jew, who, claims, to, be, an, atheist, or, converts, to, another, religion, is, still, considered, by, traditional, judaism, to, be, jewish, according, to, some, sources, the, reform, movement, has, maintained, that, a, jew, who, has, converted, to, another, religion, is, no, longer, a, jew, and, the, israeli, government, has, also, taken, that, stance, after, supreme, court, cases, and, statutes, however, the, reform, movement, has, indicated, that, this, is, not, so, cut, and, dried, and, different, situations, call, for, consideration, and, differing, actions, for, example, jews, who, have, converted, under, duress, may, be, permitted, to, return, to, judaism, without, any, action, on, their, part, but, their, desire, to, rejoin, the, jewish, community, and, a, proselyte, who, has, become, an, apostate, remains, nevertheless, a, jew, karaite, judaism, believes, that, jewish, identity, can, only, be, transmitted, by, patrilineal, descent, although, a, minority, of, modern, karaites, believe, that, jewish, identity, requires, that, both, parents, be, jewish, and, not, only, the, father, they, argue, that, only, patrilineal, descent, can, transmit, jewish, identity, on, the, grounds, that, all, descent, in, the, torah, went, according, to, the, male, line, the, question, of, what, determines, jewish, identity, in, the, state, of, israel, was, given, new, impetus, when, in, the, 1950s, david, ben, gurion, requested, opinions, on, mihu, yehudi, who, is, a, jew, from, jewish, religious, authorities, and, intellectuals, worldwide, in, order, to, settle, citizenship, questions, this, is, still, not, settled, and, occasionally, resurfaces, in, israeli, politics, historical, definitions, of, jewish, identity, have, traditionally, been, based, on, halakhic, definitions, of, matrilineal, descent, and, halakhic, conversions, historical, definitions, of, who, is, a, jew, date, back, to, the, codification, of, the, oral, torah, into, the, babylonian, talmud, around, 200, ce, interpretations, of, sections, of, the, tanakh, such, as, deuteronomy, 7, 1, 5, by, jewish, sages, are, used, as, a, warning, against, intermarriage, between, jews, and, canaanites, because, will, cause, your, child, to, turn, away, from, me, and, they, will, worship, the, gods, i, e, idols, of, others, leviticus, 24, says, that, the, son, in, a, marriage, between, a, hebrew, woman, and, an, egyptian, man, is, of, the, community, of, israel, this, is, complemented, by, ezra, 10, where, israelites, returning, from, babylon, vow, to, put, aside, their, gentile, wives, and, their, children, a, popular, theory, is, that, the, rape, of, jewish, women, in, captivity, brought, about, the, law, of, jewish, identity, being, inherited, through, the, maternal, line, although, scholars, challenge, this, theory, citing, the, talmudic, establishment, of, the, law, from, the, pre, exile, period, since, the, anti, religious, haskalah, movement, of, the, late, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, halakhic, interpretations, of, jewish, identity, have, been, challenged, the, total, number, of, jews, worldwide, is, difficult, to, assess, because, the, definition, of, who, is, a, jew, is, problematic, not, all, jews, identify, themselves, as, jewish, and, some, who, identify, as, jewish, are, not, considered, so, by, other, jews, according, to, the, jewish, year, book, 1901, the, global, jewish, population, in, 1900, was, around, 11, million, the, latest, available, data, is, from, the, world, jewish, population, survey, of, 2002, and, the, jewish, year, calendar, 2005, in, 2002, according, to, the, jewish, population, survey, there, were, 13, 3, million, jews, around, the, world, the, jewish, year, calendar, cites, 14, 6, million, it, is, 0, 25, of, world, population, jewish, population, growth, is, currently, near, zero, percent, with, 0, 3, growth, from, 2000, to, 2001, the, overall, growth, rate, of, jews, in, israel, is, 1, 7, annually, and, is, consistently, growing, through, natural, population, growth, and, extensive, immigration, the, diaspora, countries, by, contrast, have, low, jewish, birth, rates, an, increasingly, elderly, age, composition, high, rates, of, interreligious, marriage, and, a, negative, balance, of, people, leaving, judaism, versus, those, joining, in, 2022, the, world, jewish, population, was, estimated, at, 15, 2, million, the, majority, live, in, one, of, only, two, countires, israel, and, the, united, states, about, 46, 6, of, all, jews, resided, in, israel, 6, 9, million, and, another, 6, million, jews, resided, in, the, united, states, with, most, of, the, remainder, living, in, europe, and, other, groups, spread, throughout, canada, latin, america, asia, africa, and, australia, rabbinic, judaism, or, in, some, older, sources, rabbinism, hebrew, yahadut, rabanit, has, been, the, mainstream, form, of, judaism, since, the, 6th, century, ce, after, the, codification, of, the, talmud, it, is, characterised, by, the, belief, that, the, written, torah, written, law, cannot, be, correctly, interpreted, without, reference, to, the, oral, torah, and, the, voluminous, literature, specifying, what, behavior, is, sanctioned, by, the, law, the, jewish, enlightenment, of, the, late, 18th, century, resulted, in, the, division, of, western, jewry, primarily, the, ashkenazi, but, also, western, part, of, sephardim, and, italian, rite, jews, a, k, a, italkim, and, greek, romaniote, jews, both, last, groups, are, considered, distinct, from, ashkenazim, and, sephardim, into, religious, movements, or, denominations, especially, in, north, america, and, anglophone, countries, the, main, denominations, today, outside, israel, where, the, situation, is, rather, different, are, orthodox, conservative, and, reform, the, notion, traditional, judaism, includes, the, orthodox, with, conservative, or, solely, the, orthodox, jews, while, traditions, and, customs, vary, between, discrete, communities, it, can, be, said, that, sephardi, iberian, for, example, most, jews, from, france, and, the, netherlands, and, mizrahi, oriental, jewish, communities, do, not, generally, adhere, to, the, movement, framework, popular, in, and, among, ashkenazi, jewry, historically, sephardi, and, mizrahi, communities, have, eschewed, denominations, in, favour, of, a, big, tent, approach, this, is, particularly, the, case, in, contemporary, israel, which, is, home, to, the, largest, communities, of, sephardi, and, mizrahi, jews, in, the, world, however, individual, sephardi, and, mizrahi, jews, or, some, their, communities, may, be, members, of, or, attend, synagogues, that, do, adhere, to, one, ashkenazi, inflected, movement, or, another, among, the, pioneers, of, reform, judaism, in, the, 1820s, there, was, the, sephardic, congregation, beth, elohim, in, charleston, south, carolina, a, part, of, the, european, sephardim, were, also, linked, with, the, judaic, modernization, sephardi, and, mizrahi, observance, of, judaism, tends, toward, the, traditional, orthodox, and, prayer, rites, are, reflective, of, this, with, the, text, of, each, rite, being, largely, unchanged, since, their, respective, inception, observant, sephardim, may, follow, the, teachings, of, a, particular, rabbi, or, school, of, thought, for, example, the, sephardic, chief, rabbi, of, israel, in, israel, as, in, the, west, judaism, is, also, divided, into, major, orthodox, conservative, and, reform, traditions, at, the, same, time, for, statistical, and, practical, purposes, a, different, division, of, society, is, used, there, on, the, basis, of, a, person, s, attitude, to, religion, most, jewish, israelis, classify, themselves, as, secular, hiloni, traditional, masorti, religious, dati, or, ultra, religious, haredi, the, term, secular, is, more, popular, as, a, self, description, among, israeli, families, of, western, european, origin, whose, jewish, identity, may, be, a, very, powerful, force, in, their, lives, but, who, see, it, as, largely, independent, of, traditional, religious, belief, and, practice, this, portion, of, the, population, largely, ignores, organized, religious, life, be, it, of, the, official, israeli, rabbinate, orthodox, or, of, the, liberal, movements, common, to, diaspora, judaism, reform, conservative, the, term, traditional, masorti, is, most, common, as, a, self, description, among, israeli, families, of, eastern, origin, i, e, the, middle, east, central, asia, and, north, africa, this, term, as, commonly, used, has, nothing, to, do, with, conservative, judaism, which, also, names, itself, masorti, outside, north, america, only, a, few, authors, like, elliot, nelson, dorff, consider, the, american, conservative, masorti, movement, and, israeli, masorti, sector, to, be, one, and, the, same, there, is, a, great, deal, of, ambiguity, in, the, ways, secular, and, traditional, are, used, in, israel, they, often, overlap, and, they, cover, an, extremely, wide, range, in, terms, of, worldview, and, practical, religious, observance, the, term, orthodox, is, not, popular, in, israeli, discourse, although, the, percentage, of, jews, who, come, under, that, category, is, far, greater, than, in, the, jewish, diaspora, what, would, be, called, orthodox, in, the, diaspora, includes, what, is, commonly, called, dati, religious, including, religious, zionist, or, haredi, ultra, orthodox, in, israel, the, former, term, includes, what, is, called, religious, zionism, or, the, national, orthodox, community, as, well, as, what, has, become, known, over, the, past, decade, or, so, as, haredi, leumi, nationalist, haredi, or, hardal, which, combines, a, largely, haredi, lifestyle, with, nationalist, ideology, some, people, in, yiddish, also, refer, to, observant, orthodox, jews, as, frum, as, opposed, to, frei, more, liberal, jews, karaite, judaism, defines, itself, as, the, remnants, of, the, non, rabbinic, jewish, sects, of, the, second, temple, period, such, as, the, sadducees, the, karaites, scripturalists, accept, only, the, hebrew, bible, and, what, they, view, as, the, peshat, simple, meaning, they, do, not, accept, non, biblical, writings, as, authoritative, some, european, karaites, do, not, see, themselves, as, part, of, the, jewish, community, at, all, although, most, do, the, samaritans, a, very, small, community, located, entirely, around, mount, gerizim, in, the, nablus, shechem, region, of, the, west, bank, and, in, holon, near, tel, aviv, in, israel, regard, themselves, as, the, descendants, of, the, israelites, of, the, iron, age, kingdom, of, israel, their, religious, practices, are, based, on, the, literal, text, of, the, written, torah, five, books, of, moses, which, they, view, as, the, only, authoritative, scripture, with, a, special, regard, also, for, the, samaritan, book, of, joshua, haymanot, meaning, religion, in, ge, ez, and, amharic, refers, the, judaism, practiced, by, ethiopian, jews, this, version, of, judaism, differs, substantially, from, rabbinic, karaite, and, samaritan, judaisms, ethiopian, jews, having, diverged, from, their, coreligionists, earlier, sacred, scriptures, the, orit, are, written, in, ge, ez, not, hebrew, and, dietary, laws, are, based, strictly, on, the, text, of, the, orit, without,

there, is, no, set, blueprint, for, synagogues, and, the, architectural, shapes, and, interior, designs, of, synagogues, vary, greatly, the, reform, movement, mostly, refer, to, their, synagogues, as, temples, some, traditional, features, of, a, synagogue, are, in, addition, to, synagogues, other, buildings, of, significance, in, judaism, include, yeshivas, or, institutions, of, jewish, learning, and, mikvahs, which, are, ritual, baths, the, jewish, dietary, laws, are, known, as, kashrut, food, prepared, in, accordance, with, them, is, termed, kosher, and, food, that, is, not, kosher, is, also, known, as, treifah, or, treif, people, who, observe, these, laws, are, colloquially, said, to, be, keeping, kosher, many, of, the, laws, apply, to, animal, based, foods, for, example, in, order, to, be, considered, kosher, mammals, must, have, split, hooves, and, chew, their, cud, the, pig, is, arguably, the, most, well, known, example, of, a, non, kosher, animal, although, it, has, split, hooves, it, does, not, chew, its, cud, for, seafood, to, be, kosher, the, animal, must, have, fins, and, scales, certain, types, of, seafood, such, as, shellfish, crustaceans, and, eels, are, therefore, considered, non, kosher, concerning, birds, a, list, of, non, kosher, species, is, given, in, the, torah, the, exact, translations, of, many, of, the, species, have, not, survived, and, some, non, kosher, birds, identities, are, no, longer, certain, however, traditions, exist, about, the, kashrut, status, of, a, few, birds, for, example, both, chickens, and, turkeys, are, permitted, in, most, communities, other, types, of, animals, such, as, amphibians, reptiles, and, most, insects, are, prohibited, altogether, in, addition, to, the, requirement, that, the, species, be, considered, kosher, meat, and, poultry, but, not, fish, must, come, from, a, healthy, animal, slaughtered, in, a, process, known, as, shechitah, without, the, proper, slaughtering, practices, even, an, otherwise, kosher, animal, will, be, rendered, treif, the, slaughtering, process, is, intended, to, be, quick, and, relatively, painless, to, the, animal, forbidden, parts, of, animals, include, the, blood, some, fats, and, the, area, in, and, around, the, sciatic, nerve, halakha, also, forbids, the, consumption, of, meat, and, dairy, products, together, the, waiting, period, between, eating, meat, and, eating, dairy, varies, by, the, order, in, which, they, are, consumed, and, by, community, and, can, extend, for, up, to, six, hours, based, on, the, biblical, injunction, against, cooking, a, kid, in, its, mother, s, milk, this, rule, is, mostly, derived, from, the, oral, torah, the, talmud, and, rabbinic, law, chicken, and, other, kosher, birds, are, considered, the, same, as, meat, under, the, laws, of, kashrut, but, the, prohibition, is, rabbinic, not, biblical, the, use, of, dishes, serving, utensils, and, ovens, may, make, food, treif, that, would, otherwise, be, kosher, utensils, that, have, been, used, to, prepare, non, kosher, food, or, dishes, that, have, held, meat, and, are, now, used, for, dairy, products, render, the, food, treif, under, certain, conditions, furthermore, all, orthodox, and, some, conservative, authorities, forbid, the, consumption, of, processed, grape, products, made, by, non, jews, due, to, ancient, pagan, practices, of, using, wine, in, rituals, some, conservative, authorities, permit, wine, and, grape, juice, made, without, rabbinic, supervision, the, torah, does, not, give, specific, reasons, for, most, of, the, laws, of, kashrut, however, a, number, of, explanations, have, been, offered, including, maintaining, ritual, purity, teaching, impulse, control, encouraging, obedience, to, god, improving, health, reducing, cruelty, to, animals, and, preserving, the, distinctness, of, the, jewish, community, the, various, categories, of, dietary, laws, may, have, developed, for, different, reasons, and, some, may, exist, for, multiple, reasons, for, example, people, are, forbidden, from, consuming, the, blood, of, birds, and, mammals, because, according, to, the, torah, this, is, where, animal, souls, are, contained, in, contrast, the, torah, forbids, israelites, from, eating, non, kosher, species, because, they, are, unclean, the, kabbalah, describes, sparks, of, holiness, that, are, released, by, the, act, of, eating, kosher, foods, but, are, too, tightly, bound, in, non, kosher, foods, to, be, released, by, eating, survival, concerns, supersede, all, the, laws, of, kashrut, as, they, do, for, most, halakhot, the, tanakh, describes, circumstances, in, which, a, person, who, is, tahor, or, ritually, pure, may, become, tamei, or, ritually, impure, some, of, these, circumstances, are, contact, with, human, corpses, or, graves, seminal, flux, vaginal, flux, menstruation, and, contact, with, people, who, have, become, impure, from, any, of, these, in, rabbinic, judaism, kohanim, members, of, the, hereditary, caste, that, served, as, priests, in, the, time, of, the, temple, are, mostly, restricted, from, entering, grave, sites, and, touching, dead, bodies, during, the, temple, period, such, priests, kohanim, were, required, to, eat, their, bread, offering, terumah, in, a, state, of, ritual, purity, which, laws, eventually, led, to, more, rigid, laws, being, enacted, such, as, hand, washing, which, became, a, requisite, of, all, jews, before, consuming, ordinary, bread, an, important, subcategory, of, the, ritual, purity, laws, relates, to, the, segregation, of, menstruating, women, these, laws, are, also, known, as, niddah, literally, separation, or, family, purity, vital, aspects, of, halakha, for, traditionally, observant, jews, they, are, not, usually, followed, by, jews, in, liberal, denominations, especially, in, orthodox, judaism, the, biblical, laws, are, augmented, by, rabbinical, injunctions, for, example, the, torah, mandates, that, a, woman, in, her, normal, menstrual, period, must, abstain, from, sexual, intercourse, for, seven, days, a, woman, whose, menstruation, is, prolonged, must, continue, to, abstain, for, seven, more, days, after, bleeding, has, stopped, the, rabbis, conflated, ordinary, niddah, with, this, extended, menstrual, period, known, in, the, torah, as, zavah, and, mandated, that, a, woman, may, not, have, sexual, intercourse, with, her, husband, from, the, time, she, begins, her, menstrual, flow, until, seven, days, after, it, ends, in, addition, rabbinical, law, forbids, the, husband, from, touching, or, sharing, a, bed, with, his, wife, during, this, period, afterwards, purification, can, occur, in, a, ritual, bath, called, a, mikveh, traditional, ethiopian, jews, keep, menstruating, women, in, separate, huts, and, similar, to, karaite, practice, do, not, allow, menstruating, women, into, their, temples, because, of, a, temple, s, special, sanctity, emigration, to, israel, and, the, influence, of, other, jewish, denominations, have, led, to, ethiopian, jews, adopting, more, normative, jewish, practices, life, cycle, events, or, rites, of, passage, occur, throughout, a, jew, s, life, that, serves, to, strengthen, jewish, identity, and, bind, him, her, to, the, entire, community, the, role, of, the, priesthood, in, judaism, has, significantly, diminished, since, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, in, 70, ce, when, priests, attended, to, the, temple, and, sacrifices, the, priesthood, is, an, inherited, position, and, although, priests, no, longer, have, any, but, ceremonial, duties, they, are, still, honored, in, many, jewish, communities, many, orthodox, jewish, communities, believe, that, they, will, be, needed, again, for, a, future, third, temple, and, need, to, remain, in, readiness, for, future, duty, from, the, time, of, the, mishnah, and, talmud, to, the, present, judaism, has, required, specialists, or, authorities, for, the, practice, of, very, few, rituals, or, ceremonies, a, jew, can, fulfill, most, requirements, for, prayer, by, himself, some, activities, reading, the, torah, and, haftarah, a, supplementary, portion, from, the, prophets, or, writings, the, prayer, for, mourners, the, blessings, for, bridegroom, and, bride, the, complete, grace, after, meals, require, a, minyan, the, presence, of, ten, jews, the, most, common, professional, clergy, in, a, synagogue, are, jewish, prayer, services, do, involve, two, specified, roles, which, are, sometimes, but, not, always, filled, by, a, rabbi, or, hazzan, in, many, congregations, in, other, congregations, these, roles, are, filled, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, by, members, of, the, congregation, who, lead, portions, of, services, on, a, rotating, basis, many, congregations, especially, larger, ones, also, rely, on, a, the, three, preceding, positions, are, usually, voluntary, and, considered, an, honor, since, the, enlightenment, large, synagogues, have, often, adopted, the, practice, of, hiring, rabbis, and, hazzans, to, act, as, shatz, and, baal, kriyah, and, this, is, still, typically, the, case, in, many, conservative, and, reform, congregations, however, in, most, orthodox, synagogues, these, positions, are, filled, by, laypeople, on, a, rotating, or, ad, hoc, basis, although, most, congregations, hire, one, or, more, rabbis, the, use, of, a, professional, hazzan, is, generally, declining, in, american, congregations, and, the, use, of, professionals, for, other, offices, is, rarer, still, around, the, 1st, century, ce, there, were, several, small, jewish, sects, the, pharisees, sadducees, zealots, essenes, and, christians, after, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, in, 70, ce, these, sects, vanished, christianity, survived, but, by, breaking, with, judaism, and, becoming, a, separate, religion, the, pharisees, survived, but, in, the, form, of, rabbinic, judaism, today, known, simply, as, judaism, the, sadducees, rejected, the, divine, inspiration, of, the, prophets, and, the, writings, relying, only, on, the, torah, as, divinely, inspired, consequently, a, number, of, other, core, tenets, of, the, pharisees, belief, system, which, became, the, basis, for, modern, judaism, were, also, dismissed, by, the, sadducees, the, samaritans, practiced, a, similar, religion, which, is, traditionally, considered, separate, from, judaism, like, the, sadducees, who, relied, only, on, the, torah, some, jews, in, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, rejected, the, authority, and, divine, inspiration, of, the, oral, law, as, recorded, in, the, mishnah, and, developed, by, later, rabbis, in, the, two, talmuds, relying, instead, only, upon, the, tanakh, these, included, the, isunians, the, yudganites, the, malikites, and, others, they, soon, developed, oral, traditions, of, their, own, which, differed, from, the, rabbinic, traditions, and, eventually, formed, the, karaite, sect, karaites, exist, in, small, numbers, today, mostly, living, in, israel, rabbinical, and, karaite, jews, each, hold, that, the, others, are, jews, but, that, the, other, faith, is, erroneous, over, a, long, time, jews, formed, distinct, ethnic, groups, in, several, different, geographic, areas, amongst, others, the, ashkenazi, jews, of, central, and, eastern, europe, the, sephardi, jews, of, spain, portugal, and, north, africa, the, beta, israel, of, ethiopia, the, yemenite, jews, from, the, southern, tip, of, the, arabian, peninsula, and, the, malabari, and, cochin, jews, from, kerala, many, of, these, groups, have, developed, differences, in, their, prayers, traditions, and, accepted, canons, however, these, distinctions, are, mainly, the, result, of, their, being, formed, at, some, cultural, distance, from, normative, rabbinic, judaism, rather, than, based, on, any, doctrinal, dispute, antisemitism, arose, during, the, middle, ages, in, the, form, of, persecutions, pogroms, forced, conversions, expulsions, social, restrictions, and, ghettoization, this, was, different, in, quality, from, the, repressions, of, jews, which, had, occurred, in, ancient, times, ancient, repressions, were, politically, motivated, and, jews, were, treated, the, same, as, members, of, other, ethnic, groups, with, the, rise, of, the, churches, the, main, motive, for, attacks, on, jews, changed, from, politics, to, religion, and, the, religious, motive, for, such, attacks, was, specifically, derived, from, christian, views, about, jews, and, judaism, during, the, middle, ages, jewish, people, who, lived, under, muslim, rule, generally, experienced, tolerance, and, integration, but, there, were, occasional, outbreaks, of, violence, like, almohad, s, persecutions, hasidic, judaism, was, founded, by, yisroel, ben, eliezer, 1700, 1760, also, known, as, the, ba, al, shem, tov, or, besht, it, originated, in, a, time, of, persecution, of, the, jewish, people, when, european, jews, had, turned, inward, to, talmud, study, many, felt, that, most, expressions, of, jewish, life, had, become, too, academic, and, that, they, no, longer, had, any, emphasis, on, spirituality, or, joy, its, adherents, favored, small, and, informal, gatherings, called, shtiebel, which, in, contrast, to, a, traditional, synagogue, could, be, used, both, as, a, place, of, worship, and, for, celebrations, involving, dancing, eating, and, socializing, ba, al, shem, tov, s, disciples, attracted, many, followers, they, themselves, established, numerous, hasidic, sects, across, europe, unlike, other, religions, which, typically, expanded, through, word, of, mouth, or, by, use, of, print, hasidism, spread, largely, owing, to, tzadiks, who, used, their, influence, to, encourage, others, to, follow, the, movement, hasidism, appealed, to, many, europeans, because, it, was, easy, to, learn, did, not, require, full, immediate, commitment, and, presented, a, compelling, spectacle, hasidic, judaism, eventually, became, the, way, of, life, for, many, jews, in, eastern, europe, waves, of, jewish, immigration, in, the, 1880s, carried, it, to, the, united, states, the, movement, itself, claims, to, be, nothing, new, but, a, refreshment, of, original, judaism, as, some, have, put, it, they, merely, re, emphasized, that, which, the, generations, had, lost, nevertheless, early, on, there, was, a, serious, schism, between, hasidic, and, non, hasidic, jews, european, jews, who, rejected, the, hasidic, movement, were, dubbed, by, the, hasidim, as, misnagdim, lit, opponents, some, of, the, reasons, for, the, rejection, of, hasidic, judaism, were, the, exuberance, of, hasidic, worship, its, deviation, from, tradition, in, ascribing, infallibility, and, miracles, to, their, leaders, and, the, concern, that, it, might, become, a, messianic, sect, over, time, differences, between, the, hasidim, and, their, opponents, have, slowly, diminished, and, both, groups, are, now, considered, part, of, haredi, judaism, in, the, late, 18th, century, ce, europe, was, swept, by, a, group, of, intellectual, social, and, political, movements, known, as, the, enlightenment, the, enlightenment, led, to, reductions, in, the, european, laws, that, prohibited, jews, to, interact, with, the, wider, secular, world, thus, allowing, jews, access, to, secular, education, and, experience, a, parallel, jewish, movement, haskalah, or, the, jewish, enlightenment, began, especially, in, central, europe, and, western, europe, in, response, to, both, the, enlightenment, and, these, new, freedoms, it, placed, an, emphasis, on, integration, with, secular, society, and, a, pursuit, of, non, religious, knowledge, through, reason, with, the, promise, of, political, emancipation, many, jews, saw, no, reason, to, continue, to, observe, halakha, and, increasing, numbers, of, jews, assimilated, into, christian, europe, modern, religious, movements, of, judaism, all, formed, in, reaction, to, this, trend, in, central, europe, followed, by, great, britain, and, the, united, states, reform, or, liberal, judaism, developed, relaxing, legal, obligations, especially, those, that, limited, jewish, relations, with, non, jews, emulating, protestant, decorum, in, prayer, and, emphasizing, the, ethical, values, of, judaism, s, prophetic, tradition, modern, orthodox, judaism, developed, in, reaction, to, reform, judaism, by, leaders, who, argued, that, jews, could, participate, in, public, life, as, citizens, equal, to, christians, while, maintaining, the, observance, of, halakha, meanwhile, in, the, united, states, wealthy, reform, jews, helped, european, scholars, who, were, orthodox, in, practice, but, critical, and, skeptical, in, their, study, of, the, bible, and, talmud, to, establish, a, seminary, to, train, rabbis, for, immigrants, from, eastern, europe, these, left, wing, orthodox, rabbis, were, joined, by, right, wing, reform, rabbis, who, felt, that, halakha, should, not, be, entirely, abandoned, to, form, the, conservative, movement, orthodox, jews, who, opposed, the, haskalah, formed, haredi, orthodox, judaism, after, massive, movements, of, jews, following, the, holocaust, and, the, creation, of, the, state, of, israel, these, movements, have, competed, for, followers, from, among, traditional, jews, in, or, from, other, countries, jewish, religious, practice, varies, widely, through, all, levels, of, observance, according, to, the, 2001, edition, of, the, national, jewish, population, survey, in, the, united, states, jewish, community, the, world, s, second, largest, 4, 3, million, jews, out, of, 5, 1, million, had, some, sort, of, connection, to, the, religion, of, that, population, of, connected, jews, 80, participated, in, some, sort, of, jewish, religious, observance, but, only, 48, belonged, to, a, congregation, and, fewer, than, 16, attend, regularly, christianity, was, originally, a, sect, of, second, temple, judaism, but, the, two, religions, diverged, in, the, first, century, the, differences, between, christianity, and, judaism, originally, centered, on, whether, jesus, was, the, jewish, messiah, but, eventually, became, irreconcilable, major, differences, between, the, two, faiths, include, the, nature, of, the, messiah, of, atonement, and, sin, the, status, of, god, s, commandments, to, israel, and, perhaps, most, significantly, of, the, nature, of, god, himself, due, to, these, differences, judaism, traditionally, regards, christianity, as, shituf, or, worship, of, the, god, of, israel, which, is, not, monotheistic, christianity, has, traditionally, regarded, judaism, as, obsolete, with, the, invention, of, christianity, and, jews, as, a, people, replaced, by, the, church, though, a,

and, contemporary, judaizers, the, most, well, known, of, these, is, messianic, judaism, a, religious, movement, which, arose, in, the, 1960s, in, this, elements, of, the, messianic, traditions, in, judaism, are, incorporated, in, and, melded, with, the, tenets, of, christianity, the, movement, generally, states, that, jesus, is, the, jewish, messiah, that, he, is, one, of, the, three, divine, persons, and, that, salvation, is, only, achieved, through, acceptance, of, jesus, as, one, s, savior, some, members, of, messianic, judaism, argue, that, it, is, a, sect, of, judaism, jewish, organizations, of, every, denomination, reject, this, stating, that, messianic, judaism, is, a, christian, sect, because, it, teaches, creeds, which, are, identical, to, those, of, pauline, christianity, and, because, the, conditions, for, messiah, to, have, come, accordingly, within, traditional, jewish, thought, have, not, yet, been, met, another, religious, movement, is, the, black, hebrew, israelite, group, which, not, to, be, confused, with, less, syncretic, black, judaism, a, constellation, of, movements, which, depending, on, their, adherence, to, normative, jewish,

incorporate, pagan, goddess, movement, or, wiccan, beliefs, with, some, jewish, religious, practices, jewish, buddhists, another, loosely, organized, group, that, incorporates, elements, of, buddhism, and, other, asian, spirituality, in, their, faith, some, renewal, jews, borrow, freely, and, openly, from, buddhism, sufism, native, american, religions, and, other, faiths, the, kabbalah, centre, which, employs, teachers, from, multiple, religions, is, a, one, of, new, age, judaism, movements, that, claims, to, popularize, the, kabbalah, part, of, the, jewish, esoteric, tradition, criticism, of, judaism, may, include, those, that, require, revisionism, to, classical, orthodox, judaism, such, as, that, of, the, modernized, denomination, of, reconstructionist, judaism, as, established, by, american, rabbi, mordecai, kaplan, who, believed, that, classical, orthodox, judaism, is, outdated, as, a, religious, belief, on, its, own, and, should, represent, the, jewish, culture, as, a, progressive, civilization, on, the, other, hand, proponents, of, classical, orthodox, judaism, such, as, neturei, karta, and, similar, groups, strongly, oppose, the, growing, accommodation, to, political, zionism, by, haredi, jewish, groups, such, as, agudat, yisrael, a, previously, anti, zionist, proponent, of, orthodox, haredi, judaism, whom, the, neturei, karta, see, as, betrayal, by, the, agudat, yisrael, against, the, orthodoxy, in, the, belief, that, judaism, should, not, be, conflated, with, the, politics, of, zionism, orthodox, jewish, public, intellectual, and, polymath,
