korean, mythology, korean, hanja, mr, han, guk, sinhwa, is, the, group, of, myths, told, by, historical, and, modern, koreans, there, are, two, types, the, written, literary, mythology, in, traditional, histories, mostly, about, the, founding, monarchs, of, various, historical, kingdoms, and, the, much, larger, and, more, diverse, oral, mythology, mostly, narratives, sung, by, shamans, or, priestesses, mansin, in, rituals, invoking, the, gods, and, which, are, still, considered, sacred, today, the, historicized, state, foundation, myths, representing, the, bulk, of, the, literary, mythology, are, preserved, in, classical, chinese, language, works, such, as, samguk, sagi, and, samguk, yusa, one, state, s, foundation, myth, that, of, dangun, has, become, the, founding, myth, of, the, whole, korean, nation, state, foundation, myths, are, further, divided, into, northern, such, as, that, of, the, kingdom, of, goguryeo, and, its, founder, jumong, where, the, founder, is, the, son, of, a, celestial, male, figure, and, an, earthly, female, figure, and, southern, such, as, that, of, the, kingdom, of, silla, and, its, founder, hyeokgeose, where, the, founder, begins, as, an, object, descended, from, the, heavens, and, himself, marries, an, earthly, woman, other, literary, myths, include, the, origin, myths, of, family, lineages, recorded, in, genealogies, the, narratives, of, korean, shamanism, the, country, s, indigenous, religion, feature, a, diverse, array, of, both, gods, and, humans, they, are, recited, in, ritual, contexts, both, to, please, the, gods, and, to, entertain, the, human, worshippers, as, oral, literature, the, shamanic, narrative, is, regularly, revised, with, each, performance, although, a, certain, degree, of, consistency, is, required, new, narratives, have, appeared, since, the, 1960s, it, has, frequently, been, at, odds, with, the, official, ideologies, of, korean, society, and, its, mythology, is, often, characterized, as, subversive, of, traditional, norms, such, as, patriarchy, the, shamanic, mythology, is, divided, into, five, regional, traditions, with, each, region, having, original, narratives, as, well, as, distinctive, versions, of, pan, korean, narratives, the, mythological, tradition, of, southern, jeju, island, is, especially, divergent, the, two, narratives, found, in, all, and, all, but, one, region, respectively, are, the, jeseok, bon, puri, featuring, a, girl, who, in, most, versions, is, impregnated, by, a, supernaturally, potent, buddhist, priest, who, was, probably, originally, a, sky, god, and, gives, birth, to, triplets, who, themselves, become, gods, and, the, princess, bari, about, a, princess, who, is, abandoned, by, her, father, for, being, a, girl, and, who, later, resurrects, her, dead, parents, with, the, flower, of, life, korean, mythology, comprises, two, distinct, corpora, of, literature, the, first, is, the, literary, mythology, munheon, sinhwa, recorded, in, the, traditional, korean, histories, such, as, the, thirteenth, century, work, samguk, yusa, the, myths, contained, in, these, volumes, are, heavily, historicized, to, the, point, that, it, is, often, difficult, to, differentiate, between, historical, fact, and, mythology, the, primary, literary, myths, are, the, state, foundation, myths, geon, guk, sinhwa, which, recount, the, story, of, how, a, particular, kingdom, or, dynasty, was, founded, although, the, category, also, includes, other, supernatural, stories, found, in, the, historical, chronicles, as, well, as, the, origin, myths, of, non, royal, lineages, the, second, corpus, is, the, modern, oral, mythology, gubi, sinhwa, which, is, incomparably, richer, than, the, literary, tradition, in, both, sheer, quantity, of, material, and, the, diversity, of, themes, and, content, the, oral, mythology, primarily, consists, of, the, shamanic, narratives, seosa, muga, which, are, sung, by, korean, shamans, during, gut, religious, ceremonies, in, which, shamans, invoke, the, gods, while, also, mythological, in, content, these, narratives, are, very, different, in, function, and, content, from, the, literary, myths, the, state, foundation, myths, are, preserved, only, in, writing, deprived, of, their, original, ritual, context, and, have, existed, in, written, form, for, centuries, by, contrast, the, shamanic, narratives, are, oral, literature, that, is, living, mythology, sacred, religious, truth, to, the, participants, of, the, gut, they, began, to, be, published, only, in, 1930, centuries, after, the, first, attestation, of, the, literary, myths, unlike, the, historicized, accounts, of, the, literary, myths, shamans, s, songs, feature, elements, such, as, the, primordial, history, of, the, world, the, ascent, of, human, individuals, to, divinity, and, divine, retribution, upon, impious, mortals, the, academic, study, of, korean, mythology, began, with, the, literary, myths, with, historians, such, as, choe, nam, seon, 1890, 1957, and, yi, pyong, do, 1896, 1989, pioneering, the, first, studies, of, state, foundation, myths, but, research, into, the, much, richer, oral, corpus, was, minimal, until, the, 1960s, when, the, study, of, the, shamanic, narratives, was, spearheaded, by, scholars, such, as, kim, yeol, gyu, 1932, 2013, who, applied, structuralist, comparative, and, myth, ritual, approaches, to, the, songs, hyeon, yong, jun, 1931, 2016, who, published, a, vast, encyclopedia, of, jeju, ritual, and, mythology, and, seo, daeseok, born, 1942, who, established, the, literary, study, of, the, shamanic, narratives, and, whose, comprehensive, work, on, the, jeseok, bon, puri, narrative, proved, a, model, for, future, researchers, recent, trends, in, the, study, of, korean, mythology, since, the, 1990s, include, a, greater, focus, on, comparisons, with, neighboring, mythologies, new, research, into, the, hitherto, neglected, village, shrine, myths, dang, sinhwa, that, involve, the, patron, god, of, one, specific, village, and, feminist, interpretations, the, oral, mythology, is, always, religious, and, must, be, distinguished, from, the, broader, corpus, of, korean, folklore, which, might, be, secular, for, instance, the, woncheon, gang, bon, puri, a, jeju, shamanic, narrative, about, a, girl, who, goes, in, search, for, her, parents, and, becomes, a, goddess, is, either, descended, from, or, ancestral, to, a, very, similar, mainland, korean, folktale, called, the, fortune, quest, but, because, the, woncheon, gang, bon, puri, is, a, sacred, story, about, a, goddess, unlike, the, fortune, quest, the, former, is, a, myth, and, the, latter, is, not, some, korean, myths, are, mythicized, folktales, while, many, korean, folktales, are, desacralized, myths, state, foundation, myths, narrate, the, life, of, the, first, ruler, of, a, new, korean, kingdom, or, dynasty, they, include, the, founder, s, supernatural, birth, the, story, of, how, the, founder, came, to, create, his, kingdom, and, his, miraculous, death, or, departure, they, are, often, interpreted, as, euhemerized, accounts, of, actual, events, that, happened, during, the, kingdom, s, founding, the, oldest, surviving, accounts, of, the, founding, myths, of, the, ancient, korean, kingdoms, such, as, gojoseon, goguryeo, and, silla, are, transcribed, in, classical, chinese, in, korean, texts, compiled, during, or, after, the, twelfth, century, such, texts, include, samguk, sagi, samguk, yusa, jewang, ungi, eungje, siju, and, dongguk, tonggam, these, texts, were, compiled, on, the, basis, of, earlier, sources, that, are, now, lost, several, ancient, chinese, texts, are, also, important, contemporaneous, sources, for, myths, these, include, not, only, the, official, dynastic, histories, such, as, the, third, century, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, and, the, sixth, century, book, of, wei, but, also, more, general, texts, such, as, the, lunheng, written, in, 80, ce, in, the, case, of, goguryeo, there, are, also, five, chinese, language, stelae, narrating, the, kingdom, s, foundation, myth, from, the, perspective, of, the, goguryeo, people, themselves, the, oldest, of, the, five, is, the, gwanggaeto, stele, erected, in, 414, ce, the, founding, myth, of, the, goryeo, dynasty, which, ruled, korea, from, the, tenth, to, the, fourteenth, centuries, is, recorded, in, goryeo, sa, the, official, dynastic, history, published, in, the, fifteenth, century, yongbieocheon, ga, a, poem, published, around, the, same, time, as, goryeo, sa, by, the, succeeding, joseon, dynasty, is, sometimes, seen, as, the, joseon, foundation, myth, but, it, is, debated, whether, yongbieocheon, ga, should, be, seen, as, having, a, narrative, at, all, as, the, joseon, were, the, final, korean, dynasty, there, are, no, newer, founding, myths, state, foundation, myths, were, once, also, narrated, orally, perhaps, by, shamans, the, poet, yi, gyu, bo, 1168, 1241, mentions, that, both, written, and, spoken, forms, of, the, goguryeo, foundation, myth, were, known, during, his, lifetime, even, though, the, kingdom, itself, had, fallen, more, than, five, centuries, earlier, the, modern, jeseok, bon, puri, shamanic, narrative, has, many, structural, parallels, to, the, goguryeo, myth, and, may, be, a, direct, descendant, of, the, ancient, tale, the, ancient, pre, goryeo, state, foundation, myths, are, classified, into, two, major, types, northern, and, southern, though, both, share, the, central, motif, of, a, king, associated, with, the, heavens, in, the, northern, kingdoms, of, gojoseon, buyeo, and, goguryeo, the, founding, monarch, is, born, from, the, coupling, of, a, celestial, male, figure, and, an, earthly, woman, in, the, southern, kingdoms, of, silla, and, geumgwan, gaya, the, king, is, generated, from, a, physical, object, that, descends, from, heaven, and, then, marries, an, earthly, woman, himself, in, the, northern, myths, the, demigod, king, succeeds, his, heavenly, father, or, creates, a, new, kingdom, himself, in, the, south, the, celestial, being, is, crowned, by, the, consensus, of, local, chieftains, the, foundation, myth, of, gojoseon, the, earliest, korean, kingdom, is, first, recorded, in, two, nearly, contemporaneous, works, samguk, yusa, a, history, compiled, by, the, buddhist, monk, iryeon, around, the, late, 1270s, and, jewang, ungi, a, chinese, language, epic, poem, written, in, 1287, iryeon, s, account, is, as, follows, hwanung, a, younger, son, of, the, sky, god, hwanin, who, the, monk, identifies, with, the,

mountain, god, the, dangun, myth, is, of, the, northern, type, featuring, the, founder, s, birth, from, a, celestial, father, hwanung, and, an, earthly, mother, the, bear, it, is, often, interpreted, as, a, mythicized, account, of, interactions, between, three, clans, whose, totemic, symbols, or, mythological, ancestors, were, a, sky, god, a, bear, and, a, tiger, respectively, the, tiger, associated, clan, was, somehow, eliminated, but, the, bear, clan, joined, the, dominant, sky, god, clan, in, the, establishment, of, the, gojoseon, polity, folklorist, james, h, grayson, draws,

such, as, eggs, and, chests, the, myths, may, also, reflect, real, historical, figures, and, processes, hyeokgeose, may, therefore, symbolize, an, ancient, migration, of, northern, horse, riders, who, created, the, state, of, silla, with, the, support, of, local, chieftains, while, seok, talhae, stands, for, a, maritime, group, that, was, defeated, by, gaya, and, was, integrated, into, the, silla, state, and, heo, hwang, ok, preserves, the, historical, memory, of, a, merchant, group, that, contributed, to, the, establishment, of, the, early, geumgwan, gaya, polity, many, other, supernatural, stories, are, contained, in, the, samguk, yusa, to, the, point, that, grayson, calls, its, compiler, iryeon, the, first, korean, folklorist, some, of, these, stories, reflect, shamanic, mythology, one, example, is, the, tale, of, cheoyong, cheoyong, a, son, of, the, dragon, king, of, the, east, sea, arrives, in, the, silla, court, where, he, marries, a, beautiful, woman, one, night, he, goes, home, to, find, the, smallpox, god, having, sex, with, his, wife, rather, than, punish, the, intruder, cheoyong, only, sings, a, song, the, smallpox, god, is, so, astounded, by, his, mercy, that, he, repents, and, agrees, to, never, enter, any, house, with, cheoyong, s, face, on, its, gate, the, people, of, silla, then, attach, portraits, of, cheoyong, to, their, gates, the, story, of, cheoyong, is, traditionally, interpreted, as, the, myth, of, a, shaman, or, benevolent, deity, who, wards, off, the, spirit, of, pestilence, although, the, exact, relationship, between, cheoyong, s, song, which, survives, in, two, different, versions, and, korean, shamanic, chants, continues, to, be, debated, another, genre, of, literary, mythology, are, the, origin, myths, of, specific, family, lineages, which, are, recorded, in, genealogies, the, motif, of, the, founding, ancestor, s, birth, from, a, stone, or, golden, chest, also, appears, in, the, genealogies, of, many, non, royal, lineages, other, ancestor, myths, involve, the, coupling, of, a, human, and, a, non, human, the, chungju, eo, eo, fish, claim, descent, from, a, man, who, was, born, to, a, human, mother, and, a, carp, father, while, the, changnyeong, jo, are, thought, to, descend, from, the, offspring, of, a, silla, noblewoman, and, the, son, of, a, dragon, the, shamanic, narratives, are, works, of, oral, literature, sung, during, gut, the, korean, term, for, large, scale, shamanic, rituals, which, constitute, the, mythology, of, korean, shamanism, the, indigenous, polytheistic, religion, of, the, country, since, the, long, ruling, joseon, dynasty, 1392, 1910, the, attitude, of, the, korean, population, towards, the, traditional, religion, has, been, ambivalent, the, joseon, whose, state, ideology, was, neo, confucianism, were, opposed, to, shamanism, and, made, significant, efforts, to, eliminate, the, religion, from, the, public, sphere, as, koreans, increasingly, accepted, the, joseon, state, s, patriarchal, and, anti, shamanic, ideology, shamanism, became, increasingly, associated, with, women, who, were, also, marginalized, by, the, new, social, structure, it, was, in, this, restrained, capacity, as, women, s, private, religion, without, public, influence, that, shamanism, was, still, tolerated, by, joseon, society, despite, the, continued, presence, of, shamanism, as, a, significant, force, in, korean, religious, life, a, cultural, ambivalence, regarding, it, persists, as, of, 2016, the, capital, of, seoul, alone, has, hundreds, of, ritual, places, where, gut, are, held, on, most, days, of, the, year, yet, when, in, public, many, worshipers, often, christians, or, buddhists, as, well, as, practitioners, of, shamanism, avoid, discussing, their, shamanic, worship, and, sometimes, disparage, their, own, beliefs, as, superstition, reflecting, this, ambivalence, shamanism, and, its, mythology, are, often, characterized, as, subversive, of, korea, s, mainstream, values, and, official, culture, though, some, may, also, simultaneously, incorporate, more, mainstream, thinking, such, as, the, confucian, virtues, the, story, of, princess, bari, is, a, typical, example, the, myth, centers, on, the, princess, s, journey, to, the, world, of, the, dead, to, save, her, parents, the, story, is, thus, an, affirmation, of, a, confucian, virtue, that, of, filial, piety, yet, the, parents, savior, is, not, a, son, but, a, daughter, indeed, the, very, daughter, that, bari, s, parents, abandon, at, birth, merely, for, being, a, girl, later, bari, leaves, her, husband, for, her, parents, although, confucian, culture, demands, that, women, transfer, their, loyalties, to, their, husband, s, family, after, marriage, the, myth, therefore, can, be, interpreted, to, subvert, the, confucian, framework, of, patriarchy, using, the, very, values, of, confucianism, all, shamanic, narratives, meet, the, purposes, of, both, religiosity, and, entertainment, albeit, to, varying, degrees, shamanic, narratives, are, almost, never, sung, in, non, religious, circumstances, and, the, ritual, context, is, critical, to, a, full, understanding, of, the, mythology, for, instance, the, story, of, bari, is, performed, at, ceremonies, where, the, soul, of, the, deceased, is, sent, off, to, the, realm, of, the, dead, bari, is, the, goddess, that, guides, the, soul, on, its, way, and, the, story, of, the, princess, s, journey, thus, further, reassures, the, bereaved, that, the, spirit, of, their, loved, one, is, in, good, hands, at, the, same, time, shamans, also, seek, to, entertain, worshippers, this, may, be, done, by, inserting, riddles, popular, songs, or, humorous, or, sexual, descriptions, into, the, retelling, of, the, myth, or, by, having, the, accompanying, musicians, interrupt, the, narrative, with, often, vulgar, jokes, such, humorous, elements, also, helped, convey, the, subversive, message, of, many, shamanic, myths, such, as, criticism, of, gender, hierarchies, and, class, structures, as, oral, literature, shamanic, narratives, are, also, affected, by, both, the, received, tradition, and, the, performing, shaman, s, original, innovations, many, narratives, have, lengthy, formulaic, paragraphs, and, imagery, that, appear, identically, throughout, multiple, versions, of, the, myth, or, even, across, multiple, myths, and, which, are, memorized, by, shamans, when, they, first, learn, the, songs, for, instance, a, series, of, highly, metaphoric, descriptions, of, bari, s, mother, s, pregnancies, is, found, in, all, regions, where, the, princess, bari, myth, is, performed, on, the, other, hand, shamans, regularly, add, new, content, and, reword, phrases, of, the, narratives, and, the, same, shaman, may, even, sing, different, variants, of, the, same, myth, depending, on, the, specific, circumstances, of, the, gut, a, certain, degree, of, consistency, is, nonetheless, expected, in, one, case, a, jeju, shaman, reciting, the, chogong, bon, puri, narrative, was, interrupted, ten, times, for, giving, inaccurate, details, until, more, experienced, shamans, demanded, that, he, name, the, man, who, taught, him, the, shamanic, mythology, is, thus, unusually, conservative, for, oral, literature, unlike, the, literary, mythology, the, shamanic, mythology, is, a, living, tradition, capable, of, creating, new, narratives, in, the, 1960s, an, unknown, shaman, in, eastern, gangwon, province, adapted, the, simcheong, ga, a, story, involving, a, blind, man, into, the, new, simcheong, gut, narrative, recited, in, order, to, ward, off, eye, disease, the, new, myth, has, since, become, very, popular, in, the, region, another, apparently, new, myth, is, the, jemyeon, gut, narrative, which, appeared, in, the, city, of, gangneung, for, the, first, time, in, 1974, despite, not, being, attested, when, the, same, ritual, was, held, in, 1966, and, 1969, the, jemyeon, gut, myth, has, no, clear, source, for, its, story, and, researchers, have, noted, an, increase, in, narrative, details, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 1990s, several, other, shamanic, narratives, appear, to, have, been, adapted, at, some, point, from, or, otherwise, bear, a, close, relation, to, late, joseon, era, vernacular, literature, cross, cultural, similarities, have, also, been, noted, between, korean, shamanic, narratives, and, other, east, asian, myths, in, particular, the, mythology, of, manchu, shamanism, korean, shamanism, is, currently, undergoing, a, major, restructuring, that, is, not, favorable, towards, a, lengthy, performance, of, the, mythology, the, traditional, village, community, oriented, ceremonies, are, in, decline, while, rituals, commissioned, by, individual, worshippers, are, on, the, rise, the, setting, of, the, gut, has, also, shifted, to, ritual, places, where, only, the, shamans, and, the, relevant, worshippers, are, present, in, contrast, to, the, public, participation, that, was, traditional, for, the, ceremonies, most, of, these, individual, worshippers, have, little, interest, in, the, mythology, itself, sometimes, even, leaving, when, the, narrative, begins, but, are, very, invested, in, ceremonies, specifically, related, to, themselves, or, their, friends, and, family, such, as, the, gongsu, rite, in, which, the, shaman, conveys, messages, directly, from, the, gods, to, the, worshipper, with, the, emergence, of, other, forms, of, entertainment, the, entertainment, value, of, shamanic, rituals, has, also, declined, in, at, least, seoul, the, performance, of, the, princess, bari, is, therefore, becoming, increasingly, shorter, as, many, new, shamans, now, learn, narratives, from, published, books, or, recordings, rather, than, being, taught, personally, by, a, more, experienced, shaman, as, was, traditional, the, regional, diversity, of, the, mythology, may, also, be, in, decline, unlike, the, greco, roman, or, norse, mythologies, familiar, to, western, readers, the, deities, of, korean, shamanic, mythology, exist, mostly, independently, of, each, other, each, shamanic, narrative, establishes, the, nature, and, functions, of, the, deities, it, is, dedicated, to, but, there, are, few, cases, where, gods, that, have, previously, appeared, in, their, own, narratives, interact, with, each, other, it, is, thus, not, possible, to, establish, a, genealogy, of, the, gods, the, shamanic, mythology, is, divided, into, five, regional, traditions, template, korean, requires, hangul, parameter, muga, gwon, representing, the, primary, variations, of, the, two, narratives, the, jeseok, bon, puri, and, the, princess, bari, which, are, both, found, throughout, the, korean, peninsula, each, of, the, five, regions, also, has, myths, not, found, in, the, other, regions, as, well, as, distinctive, tendencies, in, the, actual, performance, of, the, narratives, the, mythological, tradition, of, southern, jeju, island, is, particularly, divergent, a, characteristic, of, korean, mythology, is, that, the, corpus, is, poorest, in, and, near, the, capital, of, seoul, the, traditional, political, economic, and, cultural, center, of, the, country, and, largest, and, most, diverse, in, south, hamgyong, province, and, jeju, island, the, northernmost, and, southernmost, peripheries, respectively, the, two, peripheral, mythologies, are, the, most, archaic, several, similar, myths, are, found, in, both, hamgyong, and, jeju, despite, the, great, distances, involved, suggesting, that, the, two, mythologies, both, descend, from, a, common, ancient, korean, source, the, northern, tradition, is, poorly, understood, because, all, of, its, area, is, now, part, of, north, korea, where, ethnographic, research, is, not, feasible, ethnologist, hong, tae, han, calls, it, a, grouping, made, for, convenience, s, sake, as, what, regional, diversity, may, have, existed, there, is, now, inaccessible, to, scholarship, the, religion, of, south, hamgyong, province, may, form, a, coherent, shamanic, tradition, independent, of, other, northern, shamanism, the, south, hamgyong, mythology, includes, a, large, corpus, of, unique, shamanic, narratives, of, which, the, most, important, is, the, song, of, dorang, seonbi, and, cheongjeong, gaksi, centering, on, a, woman, who, attempts, to, meet, her, beloved, husband, after, his, death, other, notable, south, hamgyong, myths, include, the, seng, gut, narrative, which, combines, the, creation, myth, and, the, jeseok, bon, puri, the, donjeon, puri, in, which, a, husband, and, wife, become, the, gods, of, money, and, the, jim, gajang, narrative, about, three, boys, who, take, vengeance, on, their, murderer, by, reincarnating, as, his, sons, by, contrast, the, province, of, hwanghae, in, north, korea, has, virtually, no, shamanic, mythology, the, ritual, and, entertainment, role, played, by, mythical, narratives, in, other, regions, is, served, by, an, unusually, developed, tradition, of, ceremonial, dance, and, theater, according, to, a, north, korean, shaman, who, defected, in, 2008, shamanism, is, widespread, in, modern, north, korea, and, de, facto, condoned, by, the, state, but, the, old, songs, and, chants, are, no, longer, transmitted, the, west, central, tradition, is, the, mythological, tradition, of, seoul, and, its, environs, and, is, distinguished, by, a, strong, emphasis, on, the, sacred, nature, of, the, narratives, the, recitations, are, primarily, addressed, to, the, deity, not, the, physically, present, human, worshippers, formulaic, phrases, of, the, received, tradition, are, frequently, used, hong, tae, han, characterizes, the, west, central, mythology, as, the, most, solemn, of, korean, shamanic, narratives, this, may, be, because, seoul, shamans, frequently, held, ceremonies, in, the, royal, palaces, for, queens, and, other, court, women, who, would, have, expected, dignity, and, gravity, from, the, rituals, this, region, also, has, the, fewest, myths, the, only, specifically, west, central, narrative, is, seongju, puri, explaining, the, origins, of, the, patron, god, of, the, household, in, the, city, of, seoul, itself, princess, bari, is, the, only, shamanic, narrative, that, is, performed, in, contrast, to, the, west, central, tradition, shamans, of, the, east, coast, and, gyeongsang, tradition, do, much, to, make, their, narratives, entertaining, for, the, human, worshippers, narratives, are, recited, with, an, unusual, level, of, detail, and, the, diversity, of, rhetorical, techniques, is, unprecedented, indeed, hong, tae, han, refers, to, the, east, coast, shaman, families, as, the, most, skilled, performing, arts, group, in, the, entirety, of, korea, the, musicians, go, beyond, simply, providing, background, music, and, intervene, directly, in, the, performance, while, the, performing, shaman, actively, interacts, with, the, human, audience, non, shamanic, music, such, as, folk, songs, or, buddhist, hymns, is, integrated, into, the, narrative, at, appropriate, moments, characteristic, regional, narratives, include, a, very, detailed, account, of, the, journeys, of, the, visitors, the, gods, of, smallpox, the, region, currently, has, the, most, vigorous, mythological, tradition, the, jeolla, tradition, is, characterized, by, the, reduced, importance, of, the, pan, korean, narratives, and, the, greater, prominence, of, two, other, myths, the, jangja, puri, about, a, rich, man, who, evades, the, gods, of, death, and, the, chilseong, puri, featuring, seven, brothers, who, become, gods, of, the, big, dipper, as, of, 2002, the, jeolla, mythology, was, in, decline, the, jeju, tradition, also, stresses, the, sanctity, of, the, myths, to, the, point, that, the, performing, shaman, always, sings, the, stories, while, facing, the, sacrificial, altar, turning, their, back, towards, the, musicians, and, worshippers, the, explicit, purpose, of, the, jeju, mythology, as, expressed, in, many, narratives, directly, is, to, make, the, gods, giddy, with, delight, by, retelling, them, the, story, of, their, lives, and, deeds, the, island, has, the, richest, corpus, of, shamanic, narratives, the, island, represents, the, only, tradition, where, princess, bari, is, unknown, the, jeju, mythological, tradition, is, also, at, risk, as, the, largest, jeju, gut, rituals, which, take, fourteen, days, to, complete, are, seldom, fully, held, nowadays, several, myths, are, already, no, longer, performed, by, shamans, several, korean, shamanic, narratives, discuss, the, creation, and, primordial, history, of, the, world, the, most, complete, creation, narratives, are, found, in, the, northern, and, jeju, traditions, although, one, is, known, from, the, west, central, tradition, several, east, coast, versions, of, the, jeseok, bon, puri, also, incorporate, relevant, elements, the, northern, and, jeju, creation, narratives, share, many, elements, in, both, traditions, the, universe, is, created, with, the, division, of, heaven, and, earth, which, were, originally, fused, a, giant, is, often, involved, in, the, creation, in, one, northern, narrative, the, creator, god, mireuk, who, cleaves, heaven, and, earth, is, said, to, have, eaten, grain, by, the, seom, 180, liters, and, to, have, worn, robes, with, sleeves, twenty, feet, 6, 7, meters, long, or, wide, in, both, northern, and, jeju, myths, a, benevolent, god, is, challenged, by, an, usurper, who, claims, rule, over, the, human, world, the, two, gods, engage, in, three, contests, to, decide, who, will, rule, in, both, the, final, challenge, is, a, flower, growing, contest, in, which, the, god, that, grows, the, better, flower, will, take, charge, of, humanity, the, benevolent, god, grows, the, better, flower, but, the, usurper, steals, it, while, the, other, god, sleeps, having, won, this, final, contest, the, usurper, takes, control, of, the, world, but, his, unjust, victory, is, the, source, of, the, evil, and, suffering, of, the, present, world, both, northern, and, jeju, creation, myths, also, tell, of, how, there, were, once, two, suns, and, two, moons, making, the, world, very, hot, during, day, and, very, cold, during, night, until, a, deity, destroys, one, of, each, nonetheless, the, northern, and, jeju, creation, myths, differ, significantly, in, structure, in, the, north, the, two, protagonists, are, the, creator, mireuk, and, the, usurper, seokga, both, are, buddhist, names, referring, to, maitreya, and, shakyamuni, respectively, but, as, the, myths, are, otherwise, unrelated, to, buddhism, they, are, believed, to, be, indigenous, gods, whose, original, names, were, at, some, point, replaced, the, two, gods, fight, two, duels, of, supernatural, power, such, as, making, a, river, freeze, in, midsummer, or, hitting, a, bottle, of, liquor, midair, and, having, the, liquor, float, in, the, air, even, while, the, bottle, shatters, and, falls, before, the, final, flower, contest, in, the, majority, of, narratives, the, sun, and, moon, double, or, disappear, after, seokga, s, unjust, victory, and, the, usurper, is, obliged, to, embark, on, a, quest, to, restore, cosmic, order, by, retrieving, the, sun, and, moon, or, destroying, the, doubled, ones, only, the, northern, tradition,

an, alms, round, to, her, house, danggeum, aegi, gives, alms, in, the, form, of, rice, but, the, priest, usually, stalls, for, time, by, spilling, all, the, rice, that, she, gives, so, that, she, must, pick, them, up, and, offer, them, again, in, the, jeolla, tradition, the, priest, then, briefly, grasps, her, wrist, before, leaving, in, the, west, central, tradition, danggeum, aegi, eats, three, of, the, grains, of, rice, that, the, priest, has, spilled, in, the, northern, and, east, coast, gyeongsang, traditions, the, girl, offers, the, priest, lodging, in, her, father, s, room, but, he, refuses, he, consecutively, rejects, her, offer, of, every, room, in, the, mansion, until, she, agrees, to, share, her, own, room, with, him, where, they, have, sex, in, any, case, the, girl, becomes, pregnant, when, her, family, returns, they, attempt, to, kill, her, to, salvage, the, family, s, honor, but, fail, sometimes, because, rocks, and, earth, fall, on, top, of, her, parents, and, brothers, while, celestial, light, shines, on, the, girl, in, the, west, central, and, jeolla, traditions, they, then, expel, her, from, the, household, danggeum, aegi, successfully, finds, the, priest, and, gives, birth, in, his, presence, to, sons, usually, but, not, always, triplets, the, priest, abandons, buddhism, and, starts, a, family, with, her, and, the, sons, in, the, jeolla, tradition, the, myth, ends, here, without, anybody, becoming, gods, in, the, west, central, tradition, the, priest, confers, divinity, upon, his, sons, with, danggeum, aegi, as, the, jeseok, gods, in, the, northern, and, east, coast, gyeongsang, traditions, the, family, imprisons, danggeum, aegi, in, a, pit, or, stone, chest, but, she, miraculously, survives, and, always, gives, birth, to, triplet, sons, danggeum, aegi, is, then, brought, back, to, the, family, in, most, versions, the, triplets, prove, to, be, supernaturally, talented, such, that, the, other, children, repeatedly, attempt, and, fail, to, murder, them, out, of, envy, one, day, the, triplets, ask, who, their, father, is, danggeum, aegi, usually, gives, the, names, of, various, trees, as, their, father, but, each, tree, tells, the, triplets, that, she, is, lying, once, she, admits, the, truth, the, brothers, go, out, to, find, their, father, when, they, reach, the, priest, s, temple, he, gives, them, a, series, of, impossible, tasks, to, verify, their, parentage, this, includes, walking, in, water, while, wearing, paper, shoes, without, making, any, of, the, paper, wet, crossing, a, river, using, only, the, bones, of, cows, dead, for, three, years, creating, a, rooster, out, of, straw, that, perches, and, crows, and, eating, a, fish, and, then, vomiting, it, out, alive, the, triplets, succeed, in, all,

childbirth, and, the, triplets, either, the, jeseok, gods, or, a, group, of, equivalent, fertility, deities, in, the, northern, and, eastern, traditions, the, jeseok, bon, puri, is, often, linked, to, the, creation, narrative, with, the, usurper, seokga, being, the, same, god, as, the, priest, who, impregnates, danggeum, aegi, according, to, hong, tae, han, the, jeseok, bon, puri, was, probably, originally, episodes, in, a, longer, narrative, centering, on, the, deeds, of, the, creator, god, as, still, seen, today, in, the, south, hamgyong, seng, gut, narrative, the, northern, versions, where, the, jeseok, bon, puri, follows, the, creation, narrative, are, thus, the, most, archaic, despite, the, buddhist, veneer, the, priest, has, many, attributes, of, a, sky, god, in, various, versions, the, priest, is, said, to, live, in, the, palace, of, the, heavens, or, to, ride, into, his, home, in, the, clouds, on, a, paper, horse, or, to, take, danggeum, aegi, with, him, on, a, journey, to, heaven, using, a, rainbow, as, a, bridge, many, versions, refer, to, the, priest, or, his, temple, as, golden, hwanggeum, which, may, be, a, corruption, of, the, archaic, middle, korean, phrase, han, kem, the, great, god, the, myth, is, thus, one, in, which, an, earthly, woman, is, impregnated, by, a, celestial, male, figure, and, gives, birth, to, children, who, become, the, objects, of, worship, scholars, have, noted, parallels, between, the, meeting, of, the, girl, and, the, priest, and, the, meeting, of, yuhwa, and, haemosu, in, the, goguryeo, founding, myth, and, between, the, triplets, quest, to, find, their, father, and, their, subsequent, attainment, of, divinity, and, yuri, s, quest, to, find, jumong, and, his, subsequent, coronation, as, king, the, princess, bari, narrative, is, found, in, all, regions, except, jeju, roughly, one, hundred, versions, of, the, myth, have, been, transcribed, by, scholars, as, of, 2016, and, around, half, of, those, since, 1997, as, of, 1998, all, known, versions, were, sung, only, during, gut, rituals, held, for, the, deceased, princess, bari, is, therefore, a, goddess, closely, associated, with, funeral, rites, bari, s, exact, role, varies, according, to, the, version, sometimes, failing, to, become, a, deity, at, all, but, she, is, usually, identified, as, the, patron, goddess, of, shamans, the, conductor, of, the,

narrative, of, the, visitors, sonnim, ne, a, group, of, wandering, male, and, female, smallpox, gods, most, prominent, in, the, east, coast, gyeongsang, tradition, covers, entirely, different, themes, from, the, tragic, romance, above, the, narrative, was, traditionally, performed, to, appease, these, dangerous, deities, during, smallpox, epidemics, so, they, would, inflict, only, light, cases, of, the, disease, and, also, to, forestall, potential, epidemics, in, a, typical, version, performed, in, 1987, three, of, the, visitors, a, group, of, male, and, female, smallpox, gods, living, in,

with, great, fortune, the, crone, also, requests, that, the, visitors, bless, cheolhyeon, kim, jangja, s, fifteen, year, old, son, who, she, used, to, nurse, but, when, kim, jangja, rejects, the, visitors, a, second, time, the, female, visitor, takes, the, form, of, cheolhyeon, s, mother, in, order, to, lure, him, away, and, gives, him, a, severe, case, of, smallpox, kim, jangja, vows, to, sacrifice, a, calf, for, the, gods, only, to, refuse, the, sacrifice, when, the, visitors, recall, the, illness, in, response, the, outraged, gods, kill, cheolhyeon, who, becomes, the, youngest,

give, the, 70, year, old, kim, jangja, a, new, son, the, jeju, tradition, has, the, richest, mythology, its, corpus, of, shamanic, narratives, called, bon, puri, is, divided, into, three, or, four, categories, the, approximately, dozen, general, bon, puri, are, known, by, all, shamans, and, involve, deities, with, universal, functions, who, are, worshipped, throughout, the, island, the, village, shrine, bon, puri, feature, the, guardian, gods, of, a, specific, village, and, are, known, only, by, shamans, from, the, relevant, village, and, its, neighbors, the, ancestral, bon, puri, are, about, the, patron, gods, of, specific, families, or, occupations, despite, the, name, of, the, category, the, god, is, often, not, perceived, as, an, actual, ancestor, they, are, known, only, by, shamans, from, the, family, or, occupation, in, question, and, are, thus, poorly, understood, some, analyses, also, include, a, small, fourth, category, of, special, bon, puri, which, are, no, longer, ritually, performed, by, shamans, many, general, bon, puri, are, clearly, related, to, mainland, narratives, but, have, distinctive, jeju, characteristics, a, typical, example, is, the, chogong, bon, puri, the, jeju, version, of, the, jeseok, bon, puri, but, with, a, very, different, ritual, function, the, early, part, of, the, chogong, bon, puri, is, similar, to, jeseok, bon, puri, versions, from, jeolla, the, closest, part, of, the, mainland, after, being, supernaturally, impregnated, the, teenage, noga, danpung, agassi, the, jeju, equivalent, of, the, mainland, danggeum, aegi, is, expelled, from, home, and, goes, in, search, for, the, priest, but, in, jeju, the, priest, sends, her, away, to, give, birth, to, the, triplets, alone, unlike, in, jeolla, but, like, in, the, northern, and, eastern, traditions, the, triplets, grow, up, fatherless, when, they, best, three, thousand, confucian, scholars, in, the, civil, service, examinations, the, jealous, scholars, murder, noga, danpung, agassi, the, triplets, visit, their, father, for, help, and, the, priest, makes, them, abandon, their, previous, life, and, initiates, them, into, shamanism, the, triplets, hold, the, first, shamanic, rituals, to, successfully, resurrect, their, mother, then, become, divine, judges, of, the, dead, in, order, to, bring, justice, to, the, scholars, in, the, afterlife, when, asked, about, the, origin, of, a, ritual, jeju, shamans, respond, that, it, was, done, that, way, in, the, chogong, bon, puri, village, shrine, bon, puri, are, dedicated, to, the, patron, gods, of, one, or, multiple, villages, most, fit, a, formulaic, structure, in, their, most, complete, form, a, carnivorous, hunting, god, emerges, from, the, hills, of, jeju, and, an, agricultural, goddess, arrives, from, overseas, often, china, the, two, marry, and, become, village, gods, but, then, separate, generally, because, the, goddess, cannot, stand, the, god, s, foul, habits, or, the, stench, of, his, meat, the, goddess, then, gives, birth, to, a, third, god, who, is, expelled, from, the, island, and, goes, on, adventures, abroad, before, returning, to, settle, as, the, god, of, a, different, village, many, villages, have, only, parts, of, this, structure, so, that, the, bon, puri, ends, with, the, marriage, or, even, involves, only, the, emergence, or, arrival, of, the, deity, many, jeju, village, gods, are, also, thought, to, be, related, to, one, another, among, the, most, important, village, bon, puri, is, thus, the, one, dedicated, to, the, gods, of, songdang, shrine, who, are, the, parents, or, grandparents, of, 424, guardian, gods, of, various, villages, and, locations, on, the, island, as, in, jeju, mainland, korean, villages, are, traditionally, associated, with, specific, guardian, deities, the, joseon, dynasty, strongly, promoted, confucian, style, worship, for, these, gods, over, traditional, shamanic, practices, by, the, late, nineteenth, century, most, important, rituals, for, village, gods, were, being, held, by, men, according, to, confucian, norms, complete, with, invocations, in, chinese, instead, of, korean, the, sacred, stories, associated, with, these, gods, are, therefore, not, or, no, longer, shamanic, narratives, except, in, jeju, island, nonetheless, many, such, stories, reflect, shamanic, beliefs, such, as, the, emphasis, on, appeasing, sorrowful, spirits, like, the, shamanic, narratives, village, shrine, myths, are, closely, associated, with, rituals, dedicated, to, the, god, often, explaining, the, identity, of, the, deity, that, is, venerated, the, village, mythology, is, also, a, living, one, for, example, it, is, now, believed, in, the, village, of, soya, in, north, gyeongsang, province, that, the, local, guardian, god, accurately, predicted, which, soldiers, from, the, village, would, survive, world, war, ii, in, a, study, of, 94, village, shrine, myths, from, south, jeolla, province, pyo, in, ju, divides, the, myths, into, two, major, categories, depending, on, whether, the, god, is, identified, as, a, natural, object, or, a, human, spirit, the, most, prominent, natural, objects, in, the, myths, are, trees, dragons, and, rocks, in, the, village, of, jangdong, in, gwangyang, for, example, a, local, tree, is, said, to, have, wept, one, day, during, the, 1592, japanese, invasion, while, all, the, villagers, crowded, to, the, tree, at, this, strange, sound, the, japanese, attacked, finding, the, village, abandoned, they, suspected, a, trap, and, left, a, few, days, later, the, japanese, returned, and, attempted, to, cut, down, the, tree, but, the, tree, dropped, giant, branches, on, them, and, killed, them, all, the, japanese, never, dared, approach, the, village, afterwards, ever, since, locals, have, worshipped, the, tree, as, a, god, village, gods, identified, as, the, spirits, of, humans, are, often, the, founder, of, the, village, or, alternatively, a, sorrowful, spirit, wonhon, which, has, remained, in, the, human, world, after, death, because, of, their, grief, or, resentment, for, instance, because, they, were, murdered, or, because, they, died, as, a, child, the, state, foundation, myths, have, been, adapted, into, several, south, korean, tv, series, such, as, the, popular, 2006, series, jumong, but, their, potential, in, popular, culture, is, limited, due, to, the, small, size, of, the, corpus, and, the, lack, of, thematic, diversity, in, recent, years, the, larger, and, more, diverse, shamanic, mythology, has, also, appeared, in, south, korean, culture, beyond, its, ritual, context, the, shamanic, narrative, best, known, in, south, korea, is, the, princess, bari, in, large, part, due, to, the, work, of, feminists, since, the, 1990s, who, highlighted, the, myth, s, characteristics, as, women, s, literature, the, goddess, has, since, appeared, in, mediums, as, diverse, as, flash, games, to, musicals, in, 2007, hwang, sok, yong, one, of, the, country, s, most, important, living, novelists, published, bari, degi, a, novel, set, in, the, modern, day, about, a, girl, named, bari, whose, life, parallels, the, myth, of, her, divine, namesake, other, shamanic, narratives, have, also, recently, entered, popular, culture, notably, in, the, 2010s, webtoon, along, with, the, gods, which, draws, heavily, on, jeju, bon, puri, however, much, of, the, shamanic, mythology, remains, largely, unknown, to, the, south, korean, public
