as, ha, satan, the, satan, first, appears, in, the, hebrew, bible, as, a, heavenly, prosecutor, subordinate, to, yahweh, god, who, prosecutes, the, nation, of, judah, in, the, heavenly, court, and, tests, the, loyalty, of, yahweh, s, followers, during, the, intertestamental, period, possibly, due, to, influence, from, the, zoroastrian, figure, of, angra, mainyu, the, satan, developed, into, a, malevolent, entity, with, abhorrent, qualities, in, dualistic, opposition, to, god, in, the, apocryphal, book, of, jubilees, yahweh, grants, the, satan, referred, to, as, mastema, authority, over, a, group, of, fallen, angels, or, their, offspring, to, tempt, humans, to, sin, and, punish, them, although, the, book, of, genesis, does, not, mention, him, christians, often, identify, the, serpent,

relief, figure, in, mystery, plays, during, the, early, modern, period, satan, s, significance, greatly, increased, as, beliefs, such, as, demonic, possession, and, witchcraft, became, more, prevalent, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, belief, in, the, existence, of, satan, was, harshly, criticized, by, thinkers, such, as, voltaire, nonetheless, belief, in, satan, has, persisted,

either, worshipped, or, revered, in, laveyan, satanism, satan, is, a, symbol, of, virtuous, characteristics, and, liberty, satan, s, appearance, is, never, described, in, the, bible, but, since, the, ninth, century, he, has, often, been, shown, in, christian, art, with, horns, cloven, hooves, unusually, hairy, legs, and, a, tail, often, naked, and, holding, a, pitchfork, these, are, an, amalgam, of, traits, derived, from, various, pagan, deities, including, pan, poseidon, and, bes, satan, appears, frequently, in, christian, literature, most, notably, in, dante, alighieri, s, inferno, all, variants, of, the, classic, faust, story, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, and, paradise, regained, and, the, poems, of, william, blake, he, continues, to, appear, in, film, television, and, music,

story, but, replaces, the, angel, of, yahweh, with, an, entity, referred, to, as, a, satan, some, passages, clearly, refer, to, the, satan, without, using, the, word, itself, 1, samuel, 2, 12, describes, the, sons, of, eli, as, sons, of, belial, the, later, usage, of, this, word, makes, it, clearly, a, synonym, for, satan, in, 1, samuel, 16, 14, 2, yahweh, sends, a, troubling, spirit, to, torment, king, saul, as, a, mechanism, to, ingratiate, david, with, the, king, in, 1, kings, 22, 19, 25, the, prophet, micaiah, describes, to, king, ahab, a, vision, of, yahweh, sitting, on, his,

volunteers, to, be, a, lying, spirit, in, the, mouth, of, all, his, prophets, the, satan, appears, in, the, book, of, job, a, poetic, dialogue, set, within, a, prose, framework, which, may, have, been, written, around, the, time, of, the, babylonian, captivity, in, the, text, job, is, a, righteous, man, favored, by, yahweh, job, 1, 6, 8, describes, the, sons, of, god, b, n, h, l, h, m, presenting, themselves, before, yahweh, yahweh, asks, one, of, them, the, satan, where, he, has, been, to, which, he, replies, that, he, has, been, roaming, around, the, earth, yahweh, asks, have, you, considered, my, servant, job, the, satan, replies, by, urging, yahweh, to, let, him, torture, job, promising, that, job, will, abandon, his, faith, at, the, first, tribulation, yahweh, consents, the, satan, destroys, job, s, servants, and, flocks, yet, job, refuses, to, condemn, yahweh, the, first, scene, repeats, itself, with, the, satan, presenting, himself, to, yahweh, alongside, the, other, sons, of, god, yahweh, points, out, job, s, continued, faithfulness, to, which, the, satan, insists, that, more, testing, is, necessary, yahweh, once, again, gives, him, permission, to, test, job, in, the, end, job, remains, faithful, and, righteous, and, it, is, implied, that, the, satan, is, shamed, in, his, defeat, zechariah, 3, 1, 7, contains, a, description, of, a, vision, dated, to, the, middle, of, february, of, 519, bc, in, which, an, angel, shows, zechariah, a, scene, of, joshua, the, high, priest, dressed, in, filthy, rags, representing, the, nation, of, judah, and, its, sins, on, trial, with, yahweh, as, the, judge, and, the, satan, standing, as, the, prosecutor, yahweh, rebukes, the, satan, and, orders, for, joshua, to, be, given, clean, clothes, representing, yahweh, s, forgiveness, of, judah, s, sins, during, the, second, temple, period, when, jews, were, living, in, the, achaemenid, empire, judaism, was, heavily, influenced, by, zoroastrianism, the, religion, of, the, achaemenids, jewish, conceptions, of, satan, were, impacted, by, angra, mainyu, the, zoroastrian, spirit, of, evil, darkness, and, ignorance, in, the, septuagint, the, hebrew, ha, satan, in, job, and, zechariah, is, translated, by, the, greek, word, diabolos, slanderer, the, same, word, in, the, greek, new, testament, from, which, the, english, word, devil, is, derived, where, satan, is, used, to, refer, to, human, enemies, in, the, hebrew, bible, such, as, hadad, the, edomite, and, rezon, the, syrian, the, word, is, left, untranslated, but, transliterated, in, the, greek, as, satan, a, neologism, in, greek, the, idea, of, satan, as, an, opponent, of, god, and, a, purely, evil, figure, seems, to, have, taken, root, in, jewish, pseudepigrapha, during, the, second, temple, period, particularly, in, the, apocalypses, the, book, of, enoch, which, the, dead, sea, scrolls, have, revealed, to, have, been, nearly, as, popular, as, the, torah, describes, a, group, of, 200, angels, known, as, the, watchers, who, are, assigned, to, supervise, the, earth, but, instead, abandon, their, duties, and, have, sexual, intercourse, with, human, women, the, leader, of, the, watchers, is, semj, z, and, another, member, of, the, group, known, as, azazel, spreads, sin, and, corruption, among, humankind, the, watchers, are, ultimately, sequestered, in, isolated, caves, across, the, earth, and, are, condemned, to, face, judgement, at, the, end, of, time, the, book, of, jubilees, written, in, around, 150, bc, retells, the, story, of, the, watchers, defeat, but, in, deviation, from, the, book, of, enoch, mastema, the, chief, of, spirits, intervenes, before, all, of, their, demon, offspring, are, sealed, away, requesting, for, yahweh, to, let, him, keep, some, of, them, to, become, his, workers, yahweh, acquiesces, to, this, request, and, mastema, uses, them, to, tempt, humans, into, committing, more, sins, so, that, he, may, punish, them, for, their, wickedness, later, mastema, induces, yahweh, to, test, abraham, by, ordering, him, to, sacrifice, isaac, the, second, book, of, enoch, also, called, the, slavonic, book, of, enoch, contains, references, to, a, watcher, called, satanael, it, is, a, pseudepigraphic, text, of, an, uncertain, date, and, unknown, authorship, the, text, describes, satanael, as, being, the, prince, of, the, grigori, who, was, cast, out, of, heaven, and, an, evil, spirit, who, knew, the, difference, between, what, was, righteous, and, sinful, in, the, book, of, wisdom, the, devil, is, taken, to, be, the, being, who, brought, death, into, the, world, but, originally, the, culprit, was, recognized, as, cain, the, name, samael, which, is, used, in, reference, to, one, of, the, fallen, angels, later, became, a, common, name, for, satan, in, jewish, midrash, and, kabbalah, most, jews, do, not, believe, in, the, existence, of, a, supernatural, omnimalevolent, figure, traditionalists, and, philosophers, in, medieval, judaism, adhered, to, rational, theology, rejecting, any, belief, in, rebel, or, fallen, angels, and, viewing, evil, as, abstract, the, rabbis, usually, interpreted, the, word, satan, lacking, the, article, ha, as, it, is, used, in, the, tanakh, as, referring, strictly, to, human, adversaries, nonetheless, the, word, satan, has, occasionally, been, metaphorically, applied, to, evil, influences, such, as, the, jewish, exegesis, of, the, yetzer, hara, evil, inclination, mentioned, in, genesis, 6, 5, the, talmudic, image, of, satan, is, contradictory, while, satan, s, identification, with, the, abstract, yetzer, hara, remains, uniform, over, the, sages, teachings, he, is, generally, identified, as, an, entity, with, divine, agency, for, instance, the, sages, considered, satan, to, be, an, angel, of, death, later, given, the, name, samael, as, god, prohibiting, satan, from, killing, job, would, imply, he, would, otherwise, be, able, to, do, so, yet, despite, this, syncretization, with, a, known, heavenly, body, satan, is, identified, as, the, yetzer, hara, in, the, very, same, passage, satan, s, status, as, a, physical, entity, is, strengthened, by, numerous, other, rabbinical, anecdotes, one, tale, describes, two, separate, incidents, where, satan, appeared, as, a, woman, in, order, to, tempt, rabbi, meir, and, rabbi, akiva, into, sin, while, another, describes, satan, taking, the, form, of, an, ill, mannered, diseased, beggar, in, order, to, tempt, the, sage, peleimu, into, breaking, the, mitzvah, of, hospitality, another, passage, relates, that, satan, once, kissed, the, feet, of, aha, bar, jacob, for, having, taught, his, students, that, his, objectionable, actions, are, done, only, to, serve, the, intents, of, god, rabbinical, scholarship, on, the, book, of, job, generally, follows, the, talmud, and, maimonides, in, identifying, the, satan, from, the, prologue, as, a, metaphor, for, the, yetzer, hara, and, not, an, actual, entity, satan, is, rarely, mentioned, in, tannaitic, literature, but, is, found, in, babylonian, aggadah, according, to, a, narration, the, sound, of, the, shofar, which, is, primarily, intended, to, remind, jews, of, the, importance, of, teshuva, is, also, intended, symbolically, to, confuse, the, accuser, satan, and, prevent, him, from, rendering, any, litigation, to, god, against, the, jews, kabbalah, presents, satan, as, an, agent, of, god, whose, function, is, to, tempt, humans, into, sinning, so, that, he, may, accuse, them, in, the, heavenly, court, the, hasidic, jews, of, the, eighteenth, century, associated, ha, satan, with, baal, davar, each, modern, sect, of, judaism, has, its, own, interpretation, of, satan, s, identity, conservative, judaism, generally, rejects, the, talmudic, interpretation, of, satan, as, a, metaphor, for, the, yetzer, hara, and, regard, him, as, a, literal, agent, of, god, orthodox, judaism, on, the, other, hand, outwardly, embraces, talmudic, teachings, on, satan, and, involves, satan, in, religious, life, far, more, inclusively, than, other, sects, satan, is, mentioned, explicitly, in, some, daily, prayers, including, during, shacharit, and, certain, post, meal, benedictions, as, described, in, the, talmud, and, the, jewish, code, of, law, in, reform, judaism, satan, is, generally, seen, in, his, talmudic, role, as, a, metaphor, for, the, yetzer, hara, and, the, symbolic, representation, of, innate, human, qualities, such, as, selfishness, the, most, common, english, synonym, for, satan, is, devil, which, descends, from, middle, english, devel, from, old, english, d, ofol, that, in, turn, represents, an, early, germanic, borrowing, of, latin, diabolus, also, the, source, of, diabolical, this, in, turn, was, borrowed, from, greek, diabolos, slanderer, from, diaballein, to, slander, dia, across, through, ballein, to, hurl, in, the, new, testament, the, words, satan, and, diabolos, are, used, interchangeably, as, synonyms, beelzebub, meaning, lord, of, flies, is, the, contemptuous, name, given, in, the, hebrew, bible, and, new, testament, to, a, philistine, god, whose, original, name, has, been, reconstructed, as, most, probably, ba, al, zabul, meaning, baal, the, prince, the, synoptic, gospels, identify, satan, and, beelzebub, as, the, same, the, name, abaddon, meaning, place, of, destruction, is, used, six, times, in, the, old, testament, mainly, as, a, name, for, one, of, the, regions, of, sheol, revelation, 9, 11, describes, abaddon, whose, name, is, translated, into, greek, as, apollyon, meaning, the, destroyer, as, an, angel, who, rules, the, abyss, in, modern, usage, abaddon, is, sometimes, equated, with, satan, the, three, synoptic, gospels, all, describe, the, temptation, of, christ, by, satan, in, the, desert, matthew, 4, 1, 11, mark, 1, 12, 13, and, luke, 4, 1, 13, satan, first, shows, jesus, a, stone, and, tells, him, to, turn, it, into, bread, he, also, takes, him, to, the, pinnacle, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, and, commands, jesus, to, throw, himself, down, so, that, the, angels, will, catch, him, satan, takes, jesus, to, the, top, of, a, tall, mountain, as, well, there, he, shows, him, the, kingdoms, of, the, earth, and, promises, to, give, them, all, to, him, if, he, will, bow, down, and, worship, him, each, time, jesus, rebukes, satan, and, after, the, third, temptation, he, is, administered, by, the, angels, satan, s, promise, in, matthew, 4, 8, 9, and, luke, 4, 6, 7, to, give, jesus, all, the, kingdoms, of, the, earth, implies, that, all, those, kingdoms, belong, to, him, the, fact, that, jesus, does, not, dispute, satan, s, promise, indicates, that, the, authors, of, those, gospels, believed, this, to, be, true, satan, plays, a, role, in, some, of, the, parables, of, jesus, namely, the, parable, of, the, sower, the, parable, of, the, weeds, parable, of, the, sheep, and, the, goats, and, the, parable, of, the, strong, man, according, to, the, parable, of, the, sower, satan, profoundly, influences, those, who, fail, to, understand, the, gospel, the, latter, two, parables, say, that, satan, s, followers, will, be, punished, on, judgement, day, with, the, parable, of, the, sheep, and, the, goats, stating, that, the, devil, his, angels, and, the, people, who, follow, him, will, be, consigned, to, eternal, fire, when, the, pharisees, accused, jesus, of, exorcising, demons, through, the, power, of, beelzebub, jesus, responds, by, telling, the, parable, of, the, strong, man, saying, how, can, someone, enter, a, strong, man, s, house, and, plunder, his, goods, unless, he, first, binds, the, strong, man, then, indeed, he, may, plunder, his, house, matthew, 12, 29, the, strong, man, in, this, parable, represents, satan, the, synoptic, gospels, identify, satan, and, his, demons, as, the, causes, of, illness, including, fever, luke, 4, 39, leprosy, luke, 5, 13, and, arthritis, luke, 13, 11, 16, while, the, epistle, to, the, hebrews, describes, the, devil, as, him, who, holds, the, power, of, death, hebrews, 2, 14, the, author, of, luke, acts, attributes, more, power, to, satan, than, either, matthew, and, mark, in, luke, 22, 31, jesus, grants, satan, the, authority, to, test, peter, and, the, other, apostles, luke, 22, 3, 6, states, that, judas, iscariot, betrayed, jesus, because, satan, entered, him, and, in, acts, 5, 3, peter, describes, satan, as, filling, ananias, s, heart, and, causing, him, to, sin, the, gospel, of, john, only, uses, the, name, satan, three, times, in, john, 8, 44, jesus, says, that, his, jewish, or, judean, enemies, are, the, children, of, the, devil, rather, than, the, children, of, abraham, the, same, verse, describes, the, devil, as, a, man, killer, from, the, beginning, and, a, liar, and, the, father, of, lying, john, 13, 2, describes, the, devil, as, inspiring, judas, to, betray, jesus, and, john, 12, 31, 32, identifies, satan, as, the, archon, of, this, cosmos, who, is, destined, to, be, overthrown, through, jesus, s, death, and, resurrection, john, 16, 7, 8, promises, that, the, holy, spirit, will, accuse, the, world, concerning, sin, justice, and, judgement, a, role, resembling, that, of, the, satan, in, the, old, testament, jude, 9, refers, to, a, dispute, between, michael, the, archangel, and, the, devil, over, the, body, of, moses, some, interpreters, understand, this, reference, to, be, an, allusion, to, the, events, described, in, zechariah, 3, 1, 2, the, classical, theologian, origen, attributes, this, reference, to, the, non, canonical, assumption, of, moses, according, to, james, h, charlesworth, there, is, no, evidence, the, surviving, book, of, this, name, ever, contained, any, such, content, others, believe, it, to, be, in, the, lost, ending, of, the, book, the, second, chapter, of, the, pseudepigraphical, second, epistle, of, peter, copies, much, of, the, content, of, the, epistle, of, jude, but, omits, the, specifics, of, the, example, regarding, michael, and, satan, with, 2, peter, 2, 10, 11, instead, mentioning, only, an, ambiguous, dispute, between, angels, and, glories, throughout, the, new, testament, satan, is, referred, to, as, a, tempter, matthew, 4, 3, the, ruler, of, the, demons, matthew, 12, 24, the, god, of, this, age, 2, corinthians, 4, 4, the, evil, one, 1, john, 5, 18, and, a, roaring, lion, 1, peter, 5, 8, the, book, of, revelation, represents, satan, as, the, supernatural, ruler, of, the, roman, empire, and, the, ultimate, cause, of, all, evil, in, the, world, in, revelation, 2, 9, 10, as, part, of, the, letter, to, the, church, at, smyrna, john, of, patmos, refers, to, the, jews, of, smyrna, as, a, synagogue, of, satan, and, warns, that, the, devil, is, about, to, cast, some, of, you, into, prison, as, a, test, and, for, ten, days, you, will, have, affliction, in, revelation, 2, 13, 14, in, the, letter, to, the, church, of, pergamum, john, warns, that, satan, lives, among, the, members, of, the, congregation, and, declares, that, satan, s, throne, is, in, their, midst, pergamum, was, the, capital, of, the, roman, province, of, asia, and, satan, s, throne, may, be, referring, to, the, monumental, pergamon, altar, in, the, city, which, was, dedicated, to, the, greek, god, zeus, or, to, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, roman, emperor, augustus, revelation, 12, 3, describes, a, vision, of, a, great, red, dragon, with, seven, heads, ten, horns, seven, crowns, and, a, massive, tail, an, image, which, is, likely, inspired, by, the, vision, of, the, four, beasts, from, the, sea, in, the, book, of, daniel, and, the, leviathan, described, in, various, old, testament, passages, the, great, red, dragon, knocks, a, third, of, the, sun, a, third, of, the, moon, and, a, third, of, the, stars, out, the, sky, and, pursues, the, woman, of, the, apocalypse, revelation, 12, 7, 9, declares, and, war, broke, out, in, heaven, michael, and, his, angels, fought, against, the, dragon, the, dragon, and, his, angels, fought, back, but, they, were, defeated, and, there, was, no, longer, any, place, for, them, in, heaven, dragon, the, great, was, thrown, down, that, ancient, serpent, who, is, called, devil, and, satan, the, one, deceiving, the, whole, inhabited, world, he, was, thrown, down, to, earth, and, his, angels, were, thrown, down, with, him, then, a, voice, booms, down, from, heaven, heralding, the, defeat, of, the, accuser, ho, kantegor, identifying, the, satan, of, revelation, with, the, satan, of, the, old, testament, in, revelation, 20, 1, 3, satan, is, bound, with, a, chain, and, hurled, into, the, abyss, where, he, is, imprisoned, for, one, thousand, years, in, revelation, 20, 7, 10, he, is, set, free, and, gathers, his, armies, along, with, gog, and, magog, to, wage, war, against, the, righteous, but, is, defeated, with, fire, from, heaven, and, cast, into, the, lake, of, fire, some, christians, associate, satan, with, the, number, 666, which, revelation, 13, 18, describes, as, the, number, of, the, beast, however, the, beast, mentioned, in, revelation, 13, is, not, satan, and, the, use, of, 666, in, the, book, of, revelation, has, been, interpreted, as, a, reference, to, the, roman, emperor, nero, as, 666, is, the, numeric, value, of, his, name, in, hebrew, christians, have, traditionally, interpreted, the, unnamed, serpent, in, the, garden, of, eden, as, satan, due, to, revelation, 12, 7, which, calls, satan, that, ancient, serpent, this, verse, however, is, probably, intended, to, identify, satan, with, the, leviathan, a, monstrous, sea, serpent, whose, destruction, by, yahweh, is, prophesied, in, isaiah, 27, 1, the, first, recorded, individual, to, identify, satan, with, the, serpent, from, the, garden, of, eden, was, the, second, century, ad, christian, apologist, justin, martyr, in, chapters, 45, and, 79, of, his, dialogue, with, trypho, other, early, church, fathers, to, mention, this, identification, include, theophilus, and, tertullian, the, early, christian, church, however, encountered, opposition, from, pagans, such, as, celsus, who, claimed, in, his, treatise, the, true, word, that, it, is, blasphemy, to, say, that, the, greatest, god, has, an, adversary, who, constrains, his, capacity, to, do, good, and, said, that, christians, impiously, divide, the, kingdom, of, god, creating, a, rebellion, in, it, as, if, there, were, opposing, factions, within, the, divine, including, one, that, is, hostile, to, god, the, name, heylel, meaning, morning, star, or, in, latin, lucifer, was, a, name, for, attar, the, god, of, the, planet, venus, in, canaanite, mythology, who, attempted, to, scale, the, walls, of, the, heavenly, city, but, was, vanquished, by, the, god, of, the, sun, the, name, is, used, in, isaiah, 14, 12, in, metaphorical, reference, to, the, king, of, babylon, ezekiel, 28, 12, 15, uses, a, description, of, a, cherub, in, eden, as, a, polemic, against, ithobaal, ii, the, king, of, tyre, the, church, father, origen, of, alexandria, c, 184, c, 253, who, was, only, aware, of, the, actual, text, of, these, passages, and, not, the, original, myths, to, which, they, refer, concluded, in, his, treatise, on, the, first, principles, which, is, preserved, in, a, latin, translation, by, tyrannius, rufinus, that, neither, of, these, verses, could, literally, refer, to, a, human, being, he, concluded, that, isaiah, 14, 12, is, an, allegory, for, satan, and, that, ezekiel, 28, 12, 15, is, an, allusion, to, a, certain, angel, who, had, received, the, office, of, governing, the, nation, of, the, tyrians, but, was, hurled, down, to, earth, after, he, was, found, to, be, corrupt, in, his, apologetic, treatise, contra, celsum, however, origen, interprets, both, isaiah, 14, 12, and, ezekiel, 28, 12, 15, as, referring, to, satan, according, to, henry, ansgar, kelly, origen, seems, to, have, adopted, this, new, interpretation, to, refute, unnamed, persons, who, perhaps, under, the, influence, of, zoroastrian, radical, dualism, believed, that, satan, s, original, nature, was, darkness, the, later, church, father, jerome, c, 347, 420, translator, of, the, latin, vulgate, accepted, origen, s, theory, of, satan, as, a, fallen, angel, and, wrote, about, it, in, his, commentary, on, the, book, of, isaiah, in, christian, tradition, ever, since, both, isaiah, 14, 12, and, ezekiel, 28, 12, 15, have, been, understood, as, allegorically, referring, to, satan, for, most, christians, satan, has, been, regarded, as, an, angel, who, rebelled, against, god, according, to, the, ransom, theory, of, atonement, which, was, popular, among, early, christian, theologians, satan, gained, power, over, humanity, through, adam, and, eve, s, sin, and, christ, s, death, on, the, cross, was, a, ransom, to, satan, in, exchange, for, humanity, s, liberation, this, theory, holds, that, satan, was, tricked, by, god, because, christ, was, not, only, free, of, sin, but, also, the, incarnate, deity, whom, satan, lacked, the, ability, to, enslave, irenaeus, of, lyons, described, a, prototypical, form, of, the, ransom, theory, but, origen, was, the, first, to, propose, it, in, its, fully, developed, form, the, theory, was, later, expanded, by, theologians, such, as, gregory, of, nyssa, and, rufinus, of, aquileia, in, the, eleventh, century, anselm, of, canterbury, criticized, the, ransom, theory, along, with, the, associated, christus, victor, theory, resulting, in, the, theory, s, decline, in, western, europe, the, theory, has, nonetheless, retained, some, of, its, popularity, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, most, early, christians, firmly, believed, that, satan, and, his, demons, had, the, power, to, possess, humans, and, exorcisms, were, widely, practiced, by, jews, christians, and, pagans, alike, belief, in, demonic, possession, continued, through, the, middle, ages, into, the, early, modern, period, exorcisms, were, seen, as, a, display, of, god, s, power, over, satan, the, vast, majority, of, people, who, thought, they, were, possessed, by, the, devil, did, not, suffer, from, hallucinations, or, other, spectacular, symptoms, but, complained, of, anxiety, religious, fears, and, evil, thoughts, satan, had, minimal, role, in, medieval, christian, theology, but, he, frequently, appeared, as, a, recurring, comedic, stock, character, in, late, medieval, mystery, plays, in, which, he, was, portrayed, as, a, comic, relief, figure, who, frolicked, fell, and, farted, in, the, background, jeffrey, burton, russell, describes, the, medieval, conception, of, satan, as, more, pathetic, and, repulsive, than, terrifying, and, he, was, seen, as, little, more, than, a, nuisance, to, god, s, overarching, plan, the, golden, legend, a, collection, of, saints, lives, compiled, in, around, 1260, by, the, dominican, friar, jacobus, de, voragine, contains, numerous, stories, about, encounters, between, saints, and, satan, in, which, satan, is, constantly, duped, by, the, saints, cleverness, and, by, the, power, of, god, henry, ansgar, kelly, remarks, that, satan, comes, across, as, the, opposite, of, fearsome, the, golden, legend, was, the, most, popular, book, during, the, high, and, late, middle, ages, and, more, manuscripts, of, it, have, survived, from, the, period, than, for, any, other, book, including, even, the, bible, itself, the, canon, episcopi, written, in, the, eleventh, century, ad, condemns, belief, in, witchcraft, as, heretical, but, also, documents, that, many, people, at, the, time, apparently, believed, in, it, witches, were, believed, to, fly, through, the, air, on, broomsticks, consort, with, demons, perform, in, lurid, sexual, rituals, in, the, forests, murder, human, infants, and, eat, them, as, part, of, satanic, rites, and, engage, in, conjugal, relations, with, demons, in, 1326, pope, john, xxii, issued, the, papal, bull, super, illius, specula, which, condemned, folk, divination, practices, as, consultation, with, satan, by, the, 1430s, the, catholic, church, began, to, regard, witchcraft, as, part, of, a, vast, conspiracy, led, by, satan, himself, during, the, early, modern, period, christians, gradually, began, to, regard, satan, as, increasingly, powerful, and, the, fear, of, satan, s, power, became, a, dominant, aspect, of, the, worldview, of, christians, across, europe, during, the, protestant, reformation, martin, luther, taught, that, rather, than, trying, to, argue, with, satan, christians, should, avoid, temptation, altogether, by, seeking, out, pleasant, company, luther, especially, recommended, music, as, a, safeguard, against, temptation, since, the, devil, cannot, endure, gaiety, john, calvin, repeated, a, maxim, from, saint, augustine, that, man, is, like, a, horse, with, either, god, or, the, devil, as, rider, in, the, late, fifteenth, century, a, series, of, witchcraft, panics, erupted, in, france, and, germany, the, german, inquisitors, heinrich, kramer, and, jacob, sprenger, argued, in, their, book, malleus, maleficarum, published, in, 1487, that, all, maleficia, sorcery, was, rooted, in, the, work, of, satan, in, the, mid, sixteenth, century, the, panic, spread, to, england, and, switzerland, both, protestants, and, catholics, alike, firmly, believed, in, witchcraft, as, a, real, phenomenon, and, supported, its, prosecution, in, the, late, 1500s, the, dutch, demonologist, johann, weyer, argued, in, his, treatise, de, praestigiis, daemonum, that, witchcraft, did, not, exist, but, that, satan, promoted, belief, in, it, to, lead, christians, astray, the, panic, over, witchcraft, intensified, in, the, 1620s, and, continued, until, the, end, of, the, 1600s, brian, levack, estimates, that, around, 60, 000, people, were, executed, for, witchcraft, during, the, entire, span, of, the, witchcraft, hysteria, the, early, english, settlers, of, north, america, especially, the, puritans, of, new, england, believed, that, satan, visibly, and, palpably, reigned, in, the, new, world, john, winthrop, claimed, that, the, devil, made, rebellious, puritan, women, give, birth, to, stillborn, monsters, with, claws, sharp, horns, and, on, each, foot, three, claws, like, a, young, fowl, cotton, mather, wrote, that, devils, swarmed, around, puritan, settlements, like, the, frogs, of, egypt, the, puritans, believed, that, the, native, americans, were, worshippers, of, satan, and, described, them, as, children, of, the, devil, some, settlers, claimed, to, have, seen, satan, himself, appear, in, the, flesh, at, native, ceremonies, during, the, first, great, awakening, the, new, light, preachers, portrayed, their, old, light, critics, as, ministers, of, satan, by, the, time, of, the, second, great, awakening, satan, s, primary, role, in, american, evangelicalism, was, as, the, opponent, of, the, evangelical, movement, itself, who, spent, most, of, his, time, trying, to, hinder, the, ministries, of, evangelical, preachers, a, role, he, has, largely, retained, among, present, day, american, fundamentalists, by, the, early, 1600s, skeptics, in, europe, including, the, english, author, reginald, scot, and, the, anglican, bishop, john, bancroft, had, begun, to, criticize, the, belief, that, demons, still, had, the, power, to, possess, people, this, skepticism, was, bolstered, by, the, belief, that, miracles, only, occurred, during, the, apostolic, age, which, had, long, since, ended, later, enlightenment, thinkers, such, as, david, hume, denis, diderot, and, voltaire, attacked, the, notion, of, satan, s, existence, altogether, voltaire, labelled, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, a, disgusting, fantasy, and, declared, that, belief, in, hell, and, satan, were, among, the, many, lies, propagated, by, the, catholic, church, to, keep, humanity, enslaved, by, the, eighteenth, century, trials, for, witchcraft, had, ceased, in, most, western, countries, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, poland, and, hungary, where, they, continued, belief, in, the, power, of, satan, however, remained, strong, among, traditional, christians, mormonism, developed, its, own, views, on, satan, according, to, the, book, of, moses, the, devil, offered, to, be, the, redeemer, of, mankind, for, the, sake, of, his, own, glory, conversely, jesus, offered, to, be, the, redeemer, of, mankind, so, that, his, father, s, will, would, be, done, after, his, offer, was, rejected, satan, became, rebellious, and, was, subsequently, cast, out, of, heaven, in, the, book, of, moses, cain, is, said, to, have, loved, satan, more, than, god, and, conspired, with, satan, to, kill, abel, it, was, through, this, pact, that, cain, became, a, master, mahan, the, book, of, moses, also, says, that, moses, was, tempted, by, satan, before, calling, upon, the, name, of, the, only, begotten, which, caused, satan, to, depart, douglas, davies, asserts, that, this, text, reflects, the, temptation, of, jesus, in, the, bible, belief, in, satan, and, demonic, possession, remains, strong, among, christians, in, the, united, states, and, latin, america, according, to, a, 2013, poll, conducted, by, yougov, fifty, seven, percent, of, people, in, the, united, states, believe, in, a, literal, devil, compared, to, eighteen, percent, of, people, in, britain, fifty, one, percent, of, americans, believe, that, satan, has, the, power, to, possess, people, w, scott, poole, author, of, satan, in, america, the, devil, we, know, has, opined, that, in, the, united, states, over, the, last, forty, to, fifty, years, a, composite, image, of, satan, has, emerged, that, borrows, from, both, popular, culture, and, theological, sources, and, that, most, american, christians, do, not, separate, what, they, know, from, the, movies, from, what, they, know, from, various, ecclesiastical, and, theological, traditions, the, catholic, church, generally, played, down, satan, and, exorcism, during, late, twentieth, and, early, twenty, first, centuries, but, pope, francis, brought, renewed, focus, on, the, devil, in, the, early, 2010s, stating, among, many, other, pronouncements, that, the, devil, is, intelligent, he, knows, more, theology, than, all, the, theologians, together, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, liberal, christianity, tends, to, view, satan, as, a, mythological, attempt, to, express, the, reality, and, extent, of, evil, in, the, universe, existing, outside, and, apart, from, humanity, but, profoundly, influencing, the, human, sphere, bernard, mcginn, describes, multiple, traditions, detailing, the, relationship, between, the, antichrist, and, satan, in, the, dualist, approach, satan, will, become, incarnate, in, the, antichrist, just, as, god, became, incarnate, in, jesus, however, in, orthodox, christian, thought, this, view, is, problematic, because, it, is, too, similar, to, christ, s, incarnation, instead, the, indwelling, view, has, become, more, accepted, which, stipulates, that, the, antichrist, is, a, human, figure, inhabited, by, satan, since, the, latter, s, power, is, not, to, be, seen, as, equivalent, to, god, s, the, arabic, equivalent, of, the, word, satan, is, shaitan, from, the, triliteral, root, n, the, word, itself, is, an, adjective, meaning, astray, or, distant, sometimes, translated, as, devil, that, can, be, applied, to, both, man, al, ins, and, al, jinn, but, it, is, also, used, in, reference, to, satan, in, particular, in, the, quran, satan, s, name, is, iblis, arabic, pronunciation, probably, a, derivative, of, the, greek, word, diabolos, muslims, do, not, regard, satan, as, the, cause, of, evil, but, as, a, tempter, who, takes, advantage, of, humans, inclinations, toward, self, centeredness, seven, suras, in, the, quran, describe, how, god, ordered, all, the, angels, and, iblis, to, bow, before, the, newly, created, human, adam, all, the, angels, bowed, but, iblis, refused, claiming, to, be, superior, to, adam, because, he, was, made, from, fire, whereas, adam, was, made, from, clay, 7, 12, consequently, god, expelled, him, from, paradise, and, condemned, him, to, jahannam, iblis, thereafter, became, a, kafir, an, ungrateful, disbeliever, whose, sole, mission, is, to, lead, humanity, astray, q, 17, 62, god, allows, iblis, to, do, this, because, he, knows, that, the, righteous, will, be, able, to, resist, iblis, s, attempts, to, misguide, them, on, judgement, day, while, the, lot, of, satan, remains, in, question, those, who, followed, him, will, be, thrown, into, the, fires, of, jahannam, after, his, banishment, from, paradise, iblis, who, thereafter, became, known, as, al, shaitan, the, demon, lured, adam, and, eve, into, eating, the, forbidden, fruit, the, primary, characteristic, of, satan, aside, from, his, hubris, and, despair, is, his, ability, to, cast, evil, suggestions, wasw, s, into, men, and, women, 15, 45, states, that, satan, has, no, influence, over, the, righteous, but, that, those, who, fall, in, error, are, under, his, power, 7, 156, implies, that, those, who, obey, god, s, laws, are, immune, to, the, temptations, of, satan, 56, 79, warns, that, satan, tries, to, keep, muslims, from, reading, the, quran, and, 16, 98, 100, recommends, reciting, the, quran, as, an, antidote, against, satan, 35, 6, refers, to, satan, as, the, enemy, of, humanity, and, 36, 60, forbids, humans, from, worshipping, him, in, the, quranic, retelling, of, the, story, of, job, job, knows, that, satan, is, the, one, tormenting, him, in, the, quran, satan, is, apparently, an, angel, while, in, 18, 50, he, is, described, as, from, the, jinns, this, combined, with, the, fact, that, he, describes, himself, as, having, been, made, from, fire, posed, a, major, problem, for, muslim, exegetes, of, the, quran, who, disagree, on, whether, satan, is, a, fallen, angel, or, the, leader, of, a, group, of, evil, jinn, according, to, a, hadith, from, ibn, abbas, iblis, was, actually, an, angel, whom, god, created, out, of, fire, ibn, abbas, asserts, that, the, word, jinn, could, be, applied, to, earthly, jinn, but, also, to, fiery, angels, like, satan, hasan, of, basra, an, eminent, muslim, theologian, who, lived, in, the, seventh, century, ad, was, quoted, as, saying, iblis, was, not, an, angel, even, for, the, time, of, an, eye, wink, he, is, the, origin, of, jinn, as, adam, is, of, mankind, the, medieval, persian, scholar, abu, al, zamakhshari, states, that, the, words, angels, and, jinn, are, synonyms, another, persian, scholar, al, baydawi, instead, argues, that, satan, hoped, to, be, an, angel, but, that, his, actions, made, him, a, jinn, abu, mansur, al, maturidi, who, is, reverred, as, the, founder, of, maturidiyyah, sunni, orthodoxy, kalam, argued, that, since, angels, can, be, blessed, by, god, they, are, also, put, to, a, test, and, can, be, punished, accordingly, satan, became, a, devil, shai, n, or, jinn, after, he, refused, to, obey, the, tarikh, khamis, narrates, that, satan, was, a, jinn, who, was, admitted, into, paradise, as, a, reward, for, his, righteousness, and, unlike, the, angels, was, given, the, choice, to, obey, or, disobey, god, when, he, was, expelled, from, paradise, satan, blamed, humanity, for, his, punishment, concerning, the, fiery, origin, of, iblis, zakariya, al, qazwini, and, muhammad, ibn, ahmad, ibshihi, state, that, all, supernatural, creatures, originated, from, fire, but, the, angels, from, its, light, and, the, jinn, from, its, blaze, thus, fire, denotes, a, disembodiment, origin, of, all, spiritual, entities, abd, al, ghani, al, maqdisi, argued, that, only, the, angels, of, mercy, are, created, from, light, but, angels, of, punishment, have, been, created, from, fire, the, muslim, historian, al, tabari, who, died, in, around, 923, ad, writes, that, before, adam, was, created, earthly, jinn, made, of, smokeless, fire, roamed, the, earth, and, spread, corruption, he, further, relates, that, iblis, was, originally, an, angel, named, azazil, or, al, harith, from, a, group, of, angels, created, from, the, fires, of, simoom, sent, by, god, to, confront, the, earthly, jinn, azazil, defeated, the, jinn, in, battle, and, drove, them, into, the, mountains, but, he, became, convinced, that, he, was, superior, to, humans, and, all, the, other, angels, leading, to, his, downfall, in, this, account, azazil, s, group, of, angels, were, called, jinn, because, they, guarded, jannah, paradise, in, another, tradition, recorded, by, al, tabari, satan, was, one, of, the, earthly, jinn, who, was, taken, captive, by, the, angels, and, brought, to, heaven, as, a, prisoner, god, appointed, him, as, judge, over, the, other, jinn, and, he, became, known, as, al, hakam, he, fulfilled, his, duty, for, a, thousand, years, before, growing, negligent, but, was, rehabilitated, again, and, resumed, his, position, until, his, refusal, to, bow, before, adam, during, the, first, two, centuries, of, islam, muslims, almost, unanimously, accepted, the, traditional, story, known, as, the, satanic, verses, as, true, according, to, this, narrative, muhammad, was, told, by, satan, to, add, words, to, the, quran, which, would, allow, muslims, to, pray, for, the, intercession, of, pagan, goddesses, he, mistook, the, words, of, satan, for, divine, inspiration, modern, muslims, almost, universally, reject, this, story, as, heretical, as, it, calls, the, integrity, of, the, quran, into, question, on, the, third, day, of, the, hajj, muslim, pilgrims, to, mecca, throw, seven, stones, at, a, pillar, known, as, the, jamrah, al, aqabah, symbolizing, the, stoning, of, the, devil, this, ritual, is, based, on, the, islamic, tradition, that, when, god, ordered, abraham, to, sacrifice, his, son, ishmael, satan, tempted, him, three, times, not, to, do, it, and, each, time, abraham, responded, by, throwing, seven, stones, at, him, the, hadith, teach, that, newborn, babies, cry, because, satan, touches, them, while, they, are, being, born, and, that, this, touch, causes, people, to, have, an, aptitude, for, sin, this, doctrine, bears, some, similarities, to, the, doctrine, of, original, sin, muslim, tradition, holds, that, only, jesus, and, mary, were, not, touched, by, satan, at, birth, however, when, he, was, a, boy, muhammad, s, heart, was, literally, opened, by, an, angel, who, removed, a, black, clot, that, symbolized, sin, muslim, tradition, preserves, a, number, of, stories, involving, dialogues, between, jesus, and, iblis, all, of, which, are, intended, to, demonstrate, jesus, s, virtue, and, satan, s, depravity, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, records, an, islamic, retelling, of, jesus, s, temptation, by, satan, in, the, desert, from, the, synoptic, gospels, ahmad, quotes, jesus, as, saying, the, greatest, sin, is, love, of, the, world, women, are, the, ropes, of, satan, wine, is, the, key, to, every, evil, abu, uthman, al, jahiz, credits, jesus, with, saying, the, world, is, satan, s, farm, and, its, people, are, his, plowmen, al, ghazali, tells, an, anecdote, about, how, jesus, went, out, one, day, and, saw, satan, carrying, ashes, and, honey, when, he, asked, what, they, were, for, satan, replied, the, honey, i, put, on, the, lips, of, backbiters, so, that, they, achieve, their, aim, the, ashes, i, put, on, the, faces, of, orphans, so, that, people, come, to, dislike, them, the, thirteenth, century, scholar, sibt, ibn, al, jawzi, states, that, when, jesus, asked, him, what, truly, broke, his, back, satan, replied, the, neighing, of, horses, in, the, cause, of, allah, muslims, believe, that, satan, is, also, the, cause, of, deceptions, originating, from, the, mind, and, desires, for, evil, he, is, regarded, as, a, cosmic, force, for, separation, despair, and, spiritual, envelopment, muslims, do, distinguish, between, the, satanic, temptations, and, the, murmurings, of, the, bodily, lower, self, nafs, the, lower, self, commands, the, person, to, do, a, specific, task, or, to, fulfill, a, specific, desire, whereas, the, inspirations, of, satan, tempt, the, person, to, do, evil, in, general, and, after, a, person, successfully, resists, his, first, suggestion, satan, returns, with, new, ones, if, a, muslim, feels, that, satan, is, inciting, him, to, sin, he, is, advised, to, seek, refuge, with, god, by, reciting, in, the, name, of, allah, i, seek, refuge, in, you, from, satan, the, outcast, muslims, are, also, obliged, to, seek, refuge, before, reciting, the, quran, according, to, some, adherents, of, sufi, mysticism, iblis, refused, to, bow, to, adam, because, he, was, fully, devoted, to, god, alone, and, refused, to, bow, to, anyone, else, for, this, reason, sufi, masters, regard, satan, and, muhammad, as, the, two, most, perfect, monotheists, sufis, reject, the, concept, of, dualism, and, instead, believe, in, the, unity, of, existence, in, the, same, way, that, muhammad, was, the, instrument, of, god, s, mercy, sufis, regard, satan, as, the, instrument, of, god, s, wrath, for, the, muslim, sufi, scholar, ahmad, ghazali, iblis, was, the, paragon, of, lovers, in, self, sacrifice, for, refusing, to, bow, down, to, adam, out, of, pure, devotion, to, god, ahmad, ghazali, s, student, sheikh, adi, ibn, musafir, was, among, the, sunni, muslim, mystics, who, defended, iblis, asserted, that, evil, was, also, god, s, creation, sheikh, adi, argued, that, if, evil, existed, without, the, will, of, god, then, god, would, be, powerless, and, powerlessness, can, t, be, attributed, to, god, some, sufis, assert, since, iblis, was, destined, by, god, to, become, a, devil, god, will, also, restore, him, to, his, former, angelic, nature, attar, compares, iblis, s, damnation, to, the, biblical, benjamin, both, were, accused, unjustly, but, their, punishment, had, a, greater, meaning, in, the, end, iblis, will, be, released, from, hell, however, not, all, muslim, sufi, mystics, are, in, agreement, with, a, positive, depiction, of, iblis, rumi, s, viewpoint, on, iblis, is, much, more, in, tune, with, islamic, orthodoxy, rumi, views, iblis, as, the, manifestation, of, the, great, sins, of, haughtiness, and, envy, he, states, cunning,

atheistic, satanism, as, exemplified, by, laveyan, satanism, practiced, by, the, church, of, satan, and, first, satanic, church, and, the, satanic, temple, holds, that, satan, does, not, exist, as, a, literal, anthropomorphic, entity, but, rather, as, a, symbol, of, a, cosmos, which, satanists, perceive, to, be, permeated, and, motivated, by, a, force, that, has, been, given, many, names, by, humans, over, the, course, of, time, in, this, religion, satan, is, not, viewed, or, depicted, as, a, hubristic, irrational, and, fraudulent, creature, but, rather, is, revered, with, prometheus, like, attributes, symbolizing, liberty, and, individual, empowerment, to, adherents, he, also, serves, as, a, conceptual, framework, and, an, external, metaphorical, projection, of, the, satanist, s,

of, man, living, as, his, prideful, carnal, nature, dictates, the, reality, behind, satan, is, simply, the, dark, evolutionary, force, of, entropy, that, permeates, all, of, nature, and, provides, the, drive, for, survival, and, propagation, inherent, in, all, living, things, satan, is, not, a, conscious, entity, to, be, worshiped, rather, a, reservoir, of, power, inside, each, human, to, be, tapped, at, will, laveyan, satanists, embrace, the, original, etymological, meaning, of, the, word, satan, hebrew, satan, meaning, adversary, according, to, gilmore, the, church, of, satan, has, chosen, satan, as, its, primary, symbol, because, in, hebrew, it, means, adversary, opposer, one, to, accuse, or, question, we, see, ourselves, as, being, these, satans, the, adversaries, opposers, and, accusers, of, all, spiritual, belief, systems, that, would, try, to, hamper, enjoyment, of, our, life, as, a, human, being, post, laveyan, satanists, like, the, adherents, of, the, satanic, temple, argue, that, the, human, animal, has, a, natural, altruistic, and, communal, tendency, and, frame, satan, as, a, figure, of, struggle, against, injustice, and, activism, they, also, believe,

indo, european, pantheon, of, the, yazidis, melek, taus, is, similar, to, the, devil, in, christian, and, islamic, traditions, as, he, refused, to, bow, down, before, humanity, therefore, christians, and, muslims, often, consider, melek, taus, to, be, satan, however, rather, than, being, satanic, yazidism, can, be, understood, as, a, remnant, of, a, pre, islamic, middle, eastern, indo, european, religion, and, or, a, ghulat, sufi, movement, founded, by, shaykh, adi, in, fact, there, is, no, entity, in, yazidism, which, represents, evil, in, opposition, to, god, such, dualism, is, rejected, by, yazidis, in, the, middle, ages, the, cathars, practitioners, of, a, dualistic, religion, were, accused, of, worshipping, satan, by, the, catholic, church, pope, gregory, ix, stated, in, his, work, vox, in, rama, that, the, cathars, believed, that, god, had, erred, in, casting, lucifer, out, of, heaven, and, that, lucifer, would, return, to, reward, his, faithful, on, the, other, hand,

practitioners, many, christians, have, incorrectly, assumed, to, worship, satan, in, actuality, wiccans, do, not, believe, in, the, existence, of, satan, or, any, analogous, figure, and, have, repeatedly, and, emphatically, rejected, the, notion, that, they, venerate, such, an, entity, the, cult, of, the, skeletal, figure, of, santa, muerte, which, has, grown, exponentially, in, mexico, has, been, denounced, by, the, catholic, church, as, devil, worship, however, devotees, of, santa, muerte, view, her, as, an, angel, of, death, created, by, god, and, many, of, them, identify, as, catholic, much, modern, folklore, about, satanism, does, not, originate, from, the, actual, beliefs, or, practices, of, theistic, or, atheistic, satanists, but, rather, from, a, mixture, of, medieval, christian, folk, beliefs, political, or, sociological, conspiracy, theories, and, contemporary, urban, legends, an, example, is, the, satanic, ritual, abuse, scare, of, the, 1980s, beginning, with,

satan, as, physically, incarnating, in, order, to, receive, worship, if, he, was, once, as, handsome, as, he, now, is, ugly, and, despite, that, raised, his, brows, against, his, maker, one, can, understand, how, every, sorrow, has, its, source, in, him, here, we, may, reign, secure, and, in, my, choice, to, reign, is, worth, ambition, though, in, hell, better, to, reign, in, hell, than,

live, inside, his, anus, chaucer, s, description, of, satan, s, appearance, is, clearly, based, on, dante, s, the, legend, of, faust, recorded, in, the, 1589, chapbook, the, history, of, the,

in, spite, of, god, s, own, omnipotence, the, english, poet, and, painter, william, blake, famously, quipped, that, the, reason, milton, wrote, in, fetters, when, he, wrote, of, angels, god, and, at, liberty, when, of, devils, hell, is, because, he, was, a, true, poet, and, of, the, devils, party, without, knowing, it, paradise, regained, the, sequel, to, paradise, lost, is, a, retelling, of,
