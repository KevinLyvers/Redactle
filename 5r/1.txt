western, philosophy, refers, to, the, philosophical, thought, traditions, and, works, of, the, western, world, historically, the, term, refers, to, the, philosophical, thinking, of, western, culture, beginning, with, the, ancient, greek, philosophy, of, the, pre, socratics, the, word, philosophy, itself, originated, from, the, ancient, greek, philosoph, a, literally, the, love, of, wisdom, ancient, greek, phile, n, to, love, and, soph, a, wisdom, the, scope, of, ancient, western, philosophy, included, the, problems, of, philosophy, as, they, are, understood, today, but, it, also, included, many, other, disciplines, such, as, pure, mathematics, and, natural, sciences, such, as, physics, astronomy, and, biology, aristotle, for, example, wrote, on, all, of, these, topics, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, were, interested, in, cosmology, the, nature, and, origin, of, the, universe, while, rejecting, unargued, fables, in, place, for, argued, theory, i, e, dogma, superseded, reason, albeit, in, a, rudimentary, form, they, were, specifically, interested, in, the, arche, the, cause, or, first, principle, of, the, world, the, first, recognized, philosopher, thales, of, miletus, born, c, 625, bce, in, ionia, identified, water, as, the, arche, claiming, all, is, water, his, use, of, observation, and, reason, to, derive, this, conclusion, is, the, reason, for, distinguishing, him, as, the, first, philosopher, thales, student, anaximander, claimed, that, the, arche, was, the, apeiron, the, infinite, following, both, thales, and, anaximander, anaximenes, of, miletus, claimed, that, air, was, the, most, suitable, candidate, pythagoras, born, c, 570, bce, from, the, island, of, samos, off, the, coast, of, ionia, later, lived, in, croton, in, southern, italy, magna, graecia, pythagoreans, hold, that, all, is, number, giving, formal, accounts, in, contrast, to, the, previous, material, of, the, ionians, the, discovery, of, consonant, intervals, in, music, by, the, group, enabled, the, concept, of, harmony, to, be, established, in, philosophy, which, suggested, that, opposites, could, together, give, rise, to, new, things, they, also, believed, in, metempsychosis, the, transmigration, of, souls, or, reincarnation, parmenides, argued, that, unlike, the, other, philosophers, who, believed, the, arche, was, transformed, into, multiple, things, the, world, must, be, singular, unchanging, and, eternal, while, anything, suggesting, the, contrary, was, an, illusion, zeno, of, elea, formulated, his, famous, paradoxes, in, order, to, support, parmenides, views, about, the, illusion, of, plurality, and, change, in, terms, of, motion, by, demonstrating, them, to, be, impossible, an, alternative, explanation, was, presented, by, heraclitus, who, claimed, that, everything, was, in, flux, all, the, time, famously, pointing, out, that, one, could, not, step, into, the, same, river, twice, empedocles, may, have, been, an, associate, of, both, parmenides, and, the, pythagoreans, he, claimed, the, arche, was, in, fact, composed, of, multiple, sources, giving, rise, to, the, model, of, the, four, classical, elements, these, in, turn, were, acted, upon, by, the, forces, of, love, and, strife, creating, the, mixtures, of, elements, which, form, the, world, another, view, of, the, arche, being, acted, upon, by, an, external, force, was, presented, by, his, older, contemporary, anaxagoras, who, claimed, that, nous, the, mind, was, responsible, for, that, leucippus, and, democritus, proposed, atomism, as, an, explanation, for, the, fundamental, nature, of, the, universe, jonathan, barnes, called, atomism, the, culmination, of, early, greek, thought, in, addition, to, these, philosophers, the, sophists, comprised, teachers, of, rhetoric, who, taught, students, to, debate, on, any, side, of, an, issue, while, as, a, group, they, held, no, specific, views, in, general, they, promoted, subjectivism, and, relativism, protagoras, one, of, the, most, influential, sophist, philosophers, claimed, that, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, suggesting, there, is, no, objective, truth, this, was, also, applied, to, issues, of, ethics, with, prodicus, arguing, that, laws, could, not, be, taken, seriously, because, they, changed, all, the, time, while, antiphon, made, the, claim, that, conventional, morality, should, only, be, followed, when, in, society, the, classical, period, of, ancient, greek, philosophy, centers, on, socrates, and, the, two, generations, of, students, who, followed, socrates, experienced, a, life, changing, event, when, his, friend, chaerephon, visited, the, oracle, of, delphi, where, the, pythia, told, him, that, no, one, in, athens, was, wiser, than, socrates, learning, of, this, socrates, subsequently, spent, much, of, his, life, questioning, anyone, in, athens, who, would, engage, him, in, order, to, investigate, the, pithia, s, claim, socrates, developed, a, critical, approach, now, called, the, socratic, method, to, examine, people, s, views, he, focused, on, issues, of, human, life, eudaimonia, justice, beauty, truth, and, virtue, although, socrates, wrote, nothing, himself, two, of, his, disciples, plato, and, xenophon, wrote, about, some, of, his, conversations, although, plato, also, deployed, socrates, as, a, fictional, character, in, some, of, his, dialogues, these, socratic, dialogues, display, the, socratic, method, being, applied, to, examine, philosophical, problems, socrates, s, questioning, earned, him, enemies, who, eventually, accused, him, of, impiety, and, corrupting, the, youth, for, this, he, was, tried, by, the, athenian, democracy, was, found, guilty, and, was, sentenced, to, death, although, his, friends, offered, to, help, him, escape, from, prison, socrates, chose, to, remain, in, athens, and, abide, by, his, principles, his, execution, consisted, of, drinking, poison, hemlock, he, died, in, 399, bce, after, socrates, death, plato, founded, the, platonic, academy, and, platonic, philosophy, as, socrates, had, done, plato, identified, virtue, with, knowledge, this, led, him, to, questions, of, epistemology, on, what, knowledge, is, and, how, it, is, acquired, socrates, had, several, other, students, who, also, founded, schools, of, philosophy, two, of, these, were, short, lived, the, eretrian, school, founded, by, phaedo, of, elis, and, the, megarian, school, founded, by, euclid, of, megara, two, others, were, long, lasting, cynicism, founded, by, antisthenes, and, cyrenaicism, founded, by, aristippus, the, cynics, considered, life, s, purpose, to, live, in, virtue, in, agreement, with, nature, rejecting, all, conventional, desires, for, wealth, power, and, fame, leading, a, simple, life, free, from, all, possessions, the, cyrenaics, promoted, a, philosophy, nearly, opposite, that, of, the, cynics, endorsing, hedonism, holding, that, pleasure, was, the, supreme, good, especially, immediate, gratifications, and, that, people, could, only, know, their, own, experiences, beyond, that, truth, was, unknowable, the, final, school, of, philosophy, to, be, established, during, the, classical, period, was, the, peripatetic, school, founded, by, plato, s, student, aristotle, aristotle, wrote, widely, about, topics, of, philosophical, concern, including, physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, politics, and, logic, aristotelian, logic, was, the, first, type, of, logic, to, attempt, to, categorize, every, valid, syllogism, his, epistemology, comprised, an, early, form, of, empiricism, aristotle, criticized, plato, s, metaphysics, as, being, poetic, metaphor, with, its, greatest, failing, being, the, lack, of, an, explanation, for, change, aristotle, proposed, the, four, causes, model, to, explain, change, material, efficient, formal, and, final, all, of, which, were, grounded, on, what, aristotle, termed, the, unmoved, mover, his, ethical, views, identified, eudaimonia, as, the, ultimate, good, as, it, was, good, in, itself, he, thought, that, eudaimonia, could, be, achieved, by, living, according, to, human, nature, which, is, to, live, with, reason, and, virtue, defining, virtue, as, the, golden, mean, between, extremes, aristotle, saw, politics, as, the, highest, art, as, all, other, pursuits, are, subservient, to, its, goal, of, improving, society, the, state, should, aim, to, maximize, the, opportunities, for, the, pursuit, of, reason, and, virtue, through, leisure, learning, and, contemplation, aristotle, tutored, alexander, the, great, who, conquered, much, of, the, ancient, western, world, hellenization, and, aristotelian, philosophy, have, exercised, considerable, influence, on, almost, all, subsequent, western, and, middle, eastern, philosophers, the, hellenistic, and, roman, imperial, periods, saw, the, continuation, of, aristotelianism, and, cynicism, and, the, emergence, of, new, philosophies, including, pyrrhonism, epicureanism, stoicism, and, neopythagoreanism, platonism, also, continued, but, came, under, new, interpretations, particularly, academic, skepticism, in, the, hellenistic, period, and, neoplatonism, in, the, imperial, period, the, traditions, of, greek, philosophy, heavily, influenced, roman, philosophy, in, imperial, times, epicureanism, and, stoicism, were, particularly, popular, the, various, schools, of, philosophy, proposed, various, and, conflicting, methods, for, attaining, eudaimonia, for, some, schools, it, was, through, internal, means, such, as, calmness, ataraxia, or, indifference, apatheia, which, was, possibly, caused, by, the, increased, insecurity, of, the, era, the, aim, of, the, cynics, was, to, live, according, to, nature, and, against, convention, with, courage, and, self, control, this, was, directly, inspiring, to, the, founder, of, stoicism, zeno, of, citium, who, took, up, the, cynic, ideals, of, steadfastness, and, self, discipline, but, applied, the, concept, of, apatheia, to, personal, circumstances, rather, than, social, norms, and, switched, shameless, flouting, of, the, latter, for, a, resolute, fulfillment, of, social, duties, the, ideal, of, living, in, accordance, with, nature, also, continued, with, this, being, seen, as, the, way, to, eudaimonia, which, in, this, case, was, identified, as, the, freedom, from, fears, and, desires, and, required, choosing, how, to, respond, to, external, circumstances, as, the, quality, of, life, was, seen, as, based, on, one, s, beliefs, about, it, an, alternative, view, was, presented, by, the, cyrenaics, and, the, epicureans, the, cyrenaics, were, hedonists, and, believed, that, pleasure, was, the, supreme, good, in, life, especially, physical, pleasure, which, they, thought, more, intense, and, more, desirable, than, mental, pleasures, the, followers, of, epicurus, also, identified, the, pursuit, of, pleasure, and, the, avoidance, of, pain, as, the, ultimate, goal, of, life, but, noted, that, we, do, not, mean, the, pleasures, of, the, prodigal, or, of, sensuality, we, mean, the, absence, of, pain, in, the, body, and, trouble, in, the, mind, this, brought, hedonism, back, to, the, search, for, ataraxia, another, important, strand, of, thought, in, post, classical, western, thought, was, the, question, of, skepticism, pyrrho, of, elis, a, democritean, philosopher, traveled, to, india, with, alexander, the, great, s, army, where, pyrrho, was, influenced, by, buddhist, teachings, most, particularly, the, three, marks, of, existence, after, returning, to, greece, pyrrho, started, a, new, school, of, philosophy, pyrrhonism, which, taught, that, it, is, one, s, opinions, about, non, evident, matters, i, e, dogma, that, prevent, one, from, attaining, ataraxia, to, bring, the, mind, to, ataraxia, pyrrhonism, uses, epoch, suspension, of, judgment, regarding, all, non, evident, propositions, after, arcesilaus, became, head, of, the, academy, he, adopted, skepticism, as, a, central, tenet, of, platonism, making, platonism, nearly, the, same, as, pyrrhonism, after, arcesilaus, academic, skepticism, diverged, from, pyrrhonism, the, academic, skeptics, did, not, doubt, the, existence, of, truth, they, just, doubted, that, humans, had, the, capacities, for, obtaining, it, they, based, this, position, on, plato, s, phaedo, sections, 64, 67, in, which, socrates, discusses, how, knowledge, is, not, accessible, to, mortals, following, the, end, of, the, skeptical, period, of, the, academy, with, antiochus, of, ascalon, platonic, thought, entered, the, period, of, middle, platonism, which, absorbed, ideas, from, the, peripatetic, and, stoic, schools, more, extreme, syncretism, was, done, by, numenius, of, apamea, who, combined, it, with, neopythagoreanism, also, affected, by, the, neopythagoreans, the, neoplatonists, first, of, them, plotinus, argued, that, mind, exists, before, matter, and, that, the, universe, has, a, singular, cause, which, must, therefore, be, a, single, mind, as, such, neoplatonism, become, essentially, a, religion, and, had, much, impact, on, later, christian, thought, medieval, philosophy, roughly, extends, from, the, christianization, of, the, roman, empire, until, the, renaissance, it, is, defined, partly, by, the, rediscovery, and, further, development, of, classical, greek, and, hellenistic, philosophy, and, partly, by, the, need, to, address, theological, problems, and, to, integrate, the, then, widespread, sacred, doctrines, of, abrahamic, religion, judaism, christianity, and, islam, with, secular, learning, some, problems, discussed, throughout, this, period, are, the, relation, of, faith, to, reason, the, existence, and, unity, of, god, the, object, of, theology, and, metaphysics, the, problems, of, knowledge, of, universals, and, of, individuation, a, prominent, figure, of, this, period, was, augustine, of, hippo, one, of, the, most, important, church, fathers, in, western, christianity, augustine, adopted, plato, s, thought, and, christianized, it, his, influence, dominated, medieval, philosophy, perhaps, up, to, the, end, of, era, and, the, rediscovery, of, aristotle, s, texts, augustinianism, was, the, preferred, starting, point, for, most, philosophers, up, until, the, 13th, century, among, the, issues, his, philosophy, touched, upon, were, the, problem, of, evil, just, war, and, what, time, is, on, the, problem, of, evil, he, argued, that, evil, was, a, necessary, product, of, human, free, will, when, this, raised, the, issue, of, the, incompatibility, of, free, will, and, divine, foreknowledge, both, he, and, boethius, solved, the, issue, by, arguing, that, god, did, not, see, the, future, but, rather, stood, outside, of, time, entirely, an, influential, school, of, thought, was, that, of, scholasticism, which, is, not, so, much, a, philosophy, or, a, theology, as, a, methodology, as, it, places, a, strong, emphasis, on, dialectical, reasoning, to, extend, knowledge, by, inference, and, to, resolve, contradictions, scholastic, thought, is, also, known, for, rigorous, conceptual, analysis, and, the, careful, drawing, of, distinctions, in, the, classroom, and, in, writing, it, often, takes, the, form, of, explicit, disputation, a, topic, drawn, from, the, tradition, is, broached, in, the, form, of, a, question, oppositional, responses, are, given, a, counterproposal, is, argued, and, oppositional, arguments, rebutted, because, of, its, emphasis, on, rigorous, dialectical, method, scholasticism, was, eventually, applied, to, many, other, fields, of, study, anselm, of, canterbury, called, the, father, of, scholasticism, argued, that, the, existence, of, god, could, be, irrefutably, proved, with, the, logical, conclusion, apparent, in, the, ontological, argument, according, to, which, god, is, by, definition, the, greatest, thing, in, conceivable, and, since, an, existing, thing, is, greater, than, a, non, existing, one, it, must, be, that, god, exists, or, is, not, the, greatest, thing, conceivable, the, latter, being, by, definition, impossible, a, refutation, of, this, was, offered, by, gaunilo, of, marmoutiers, who, applied, the, same, logic, to, an, imagined, island, arguing, that, somewhere, there, must, exist, a, perfect, island, using, the, same, steps, of, reasoning, therefore, leading, to, an, absurd, outcome, boethius, also, worked, on, the, problem, of, universals, arguing, that, they, did, not, exist, independently, as, claimed, by, plato, but, still, believed, in, line, with, aristotle, that, they, existed, in, the, substance, of, particular, things, another, important, figure, for, scholasticism, peter, abelard, extended, this, to, nominalism, which, states, in, complete, opposition, to, plato, that, universals, were, in, fact, just, names, given, to, characteristics, shared, by, particulars, thomas, aquinas, an, academic, philosopher, and, the, father, of, thomism, was, immensely, influential, in, medieval, christendom, he, was, influenced, by, newly, discovered, aristotle, and, aimed, to, reconcile, his, philosophy, with, christian, theology, aiming, to, develop, an, understanding, of, the, soul, he, was, led, to, consider, metaphysical, questions, of, substance, matter, form, and, change, he, defined, a, material, substance, as, the, combination, of, an, essence, and, accidental, features, with, the, essence, being, a, combination, of, matter, and, form, similar, to, the, aristotelian, view, for, humans, the, soul, is, the, essence, also, influenced, by, plato, he, saw, the, soul, as, unchangeable, and, independent, of, the, body, other, western, philosophers, from, the, middle, ages, include, john, scotus, eriugena, gilbert, de, la, porr, e, peter, lombard, hildegard, of, bingen, albertus, magnus, robert, grosseteste, roger, bacon, bonaventure, peter, john, olivi, mechthild, of, magdeburg, robert, kilwardby, henry, of, ghent, duns, scotus, marguerite, porete, dante, alighieri, marsilius, of, padua, william, of, ockham, jean, buridan, nicholas, of, autrecourt, meister, eckhart, catherine, of, siena, jean, gerson, and, john, wycliffe, the, medieval, tradition, of, scholasticism, continued, to, flourish, as, late, as, the, 17th, century, in, figures, such, as, francisco, su, rez, and, john, of, st, thomas, during, the, middle, ages, western, philosophy, was, also, influenced, by, the, jewish, philosophers, maimonides, and, gersonides, and, the, muslim, philosophers, alkindus, alfarabi, alhazen, avicenna, algazel, avempace, abubacer, and, averroes, the, renaissance, rebirth, was, a, period, of, transition, between, the, middle, ages, and, modern, thought, in, which, the, recovery, of, ancient, greek, philosophical, texts, helped, shift, philosophical, interests, away, from, technical, studies, in, logic, metaphysics, and, theology, towards, eclectic, inquiries, into, morality, philology, and, mysticism, the, study, of, the, classics, and, the, humane, arts, generally, such, as, history, and, literature, enjoyed, a, scholarly, interest, hitherto, unknown, in, christendom, a, tendency, referred, to, as, humanism, displacing, the, medieval, interest, in, metaphysics, and, logic, the, humanists, followed, petrarch, in, making, humanity, and, its, virtues, the, focus, of, philosophy, at, the, point, of, passage, from, renaissance, into, early, classical, modern, philosophy, the, dialogue, was, used, as, a, primary, style, of, writing, by, renaissance, philosophers, such, as, giordano, bruno, the, dividing, line, between, what, is, classified, as, renaissance, versus, modern, philosophy, is, disputed, the, term, modern, philosophy, has, multiple, usages, for, example, thomas, hobbes, is, sometimes, considered, the, first, modern, philosopher, because, he, applied, a, systematic, method, to, political, philosophy, by, contrast, ren, descartes, is, often, considered, the, first, modern, philosopher, because, he, grounded, his, philosophy, in, problems, of, knowledge, rather, than, problems, of, metaphysics, modern, philosophy, and, especially, enlightenment, philosophy, is, distinguished, by, its, increasing, independence, from, traditional, authorities, such, as, the, church, academia, and, aristotelianism, a, new, focus, on, the, foundations, of, knowledge, and, metaphysical, system, building, and, the, emergence, of, modern, physics, out, of, natural, philosophy, some, central, topics, of, western, philosophy, in, its, early, modern, also, classical, modern, period, include, the, nature, of, the, mind, and, its, relation, to, the, body, the, implications, of, the, new, natural, sciences, for, traditional, theological, topics, such, as, free, will, and, god, and, the, emergence, of, a, secular, basis, for, moral, and, political, philosophy, these, trends, first, distinctively, coalesce, in, francis, bacon, s, call, for, a, new, empirical, program, for, expanding, knowledge, and, soon, found, massively, influential, form, in, the, mechanical, physics, and, rationalist, metaphysics, of, ren, descartes, descartes, s, epistemology, was, based, on, a, method, called, cartesian, doubt, whereby, only, the, most, certain, belief, could, act, as, the, foundation, for, further, inquiry, with, each, step, to, further, ideas, being, as, cautious, and, clear, as, possible, this, led, him, to, his, famous, maxim, cogito, ergo, sum, i, think, therefore, i, exist, though, similar, arguments, had, been, made, by, earlier, philosophers, this, became, foundational, for, much, of, further, western, philosophy, as, the, need, to, find, a, route, from, the, private, world, of, consciousness, to, the, externally, existing, reality, was, widely, accepted, until, the, 20th, century, a, major, issue, for, his, thought, remained, in, the, mind, body, problem, however, one, solution, to, the, problem, was, presented, by, baruch, spinoza, who, argued, that, the, mind, and, the, body, are, one, substance, this, was, based, on, his, view, that, god, and, the, universe, are, one, and, the, same, encompassing, the, totality, of, existence, in, the, other, extreme, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, argued, instead, that, the, world, was, composed, of, numerous, individual, substances, called, monads, together, descartes, spinoza, and, leibniz, are, considered, influential, early, rationalists, in, contrast, to, descartes, thomas, hobbes, was, a, materialist, who, believed, that, everything, was, physical, and, an, empiricist, who, thought, that, all, knowledge, comes, from, sensation, which, is, triggered, by, objects, existing, in, the, external, world, with, thought, being, a, kind, of, computation, john, locke, was, another, classic, empiricist, with, his, arguments, helping, it, overtake, rationalism, as, the, generally, preferred, approach, together, with, david, hume, they, form, the, core, of, british, empiricism, george, berkeley, agreed, with, empiricism, but, instead, of, believing, in, an, ultimate, reality, which, created, perceptions, argued, in, favour, immaterialism, and, the, world, existing, as, a, result, of, being, perceived, in, contrast, the, cambridge, platonists, continued, to, represent, rationalism, in, britain, in, terms, of, political, philosophy, arguments, often, started, from, arguing, over, the, first, principles, of, human, nature, through, the, thought, experiment, of, what, the, world, would, look, like, without, society, a, scenario, referred, to, as, the, state, of, nature, hobbes, believed, that, this, would, be, a, violent, and, anarchic, calling, life, under, such, a, state, of, affairs, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, to, prevent, this, he, believed, that, the, sovereign, of, the, state, should, have, essentially, unlimited, power, in, contrast, locke, believed, the, state, of, nature, be, one, where, individuals, enjoyed, freedom, but, that, some, of, that, excluding, those, covered, by, natural, rights, had, to, be, given, up, when, forming, a, society, but, not, to, the, degree, of, absolute, rule, jean, jacques, rousseau, meanwhile, argued, that, in, nature, people, were, living, in, a, peaceful, and, comfortable, state, and, that, the, formation, of, society, led, to, the, rise, of, inequality, the, approximate, end, of, the, early, modern, period, is, most, often, identified, with, immanuel, kant, s, systematic, attempt, to, limit, metaphysics, justify, scientific, knowledge, and, reconcile, both, of, these, with, morality, and, freedom, whereas, the, rationalists, had, believed, that, knowledge, came, from, a, priori, reasoning, the, empiricists, had, argued, that, it, came, from, a, posteriori, sensory, experience, kant, aimed, to, reconcile, these, views, by, arguing, that, the, mind, uses, a, priori, understanding, to, interpret, the, a, posteriori, experiences, he, had, been, inspired, to, take, this, approach, by, the, philosophy, of, hume, who, argued, that, the, mechanisms, of, the, mind, gave, people, the, perception, of, cause, and, effect, many, other, contributors, were, philosophers, scientists, medical, doctors, and, politicians, a, short, list, includes, galileo, galilei, pierre, gassendi, blaise, pascal, nicolas, malebranche, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, christiaan, huygens, isaac, newton, christian, wolff, montesquieu, pierre, bayle, thomas, reid, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, and, adam, smith, german, idealism, emerged, in, germany, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, it, developed, out, of, the, work, of, immanuel, kant, in, the, 1780s, and, 1790s, transcendental, idealism, advocated, by, immanuel, kant, is, the, view, that, there, are, limits, on, what, can, be, understood, since, there, is, much, that, cannot, be, brought, under, the, conditions, of, objective, judgment, kant, wrote, his, critique, of, pure, reason, 1781, in, an, attempt, to, reconcile, the, conflicting, approaches, of, rationalism, and, empiricism, and, to, establish, a, new, groundwork, for, studying, metaphysics, although, kant, held, that, objective, knowledge, of, the, world, required, the, mind, to, impose, a, conceptual, or, categorical, framework, on, the, stream, of, pure, sensory, data, a, framework, including, space, and, time, themselves, he, maintained, that, things, in, themselves, existed, independently, of, human, perceptions, and, judgments, he, was, therefore, not, an, idealist, in, any, simple, sense, kant, s, account, of, things, in, themselves, is, both, controversial, and, highly, complex, continuing, his, work, johann, gottlieb, fichte, and, friedrich, schelling, dispensed, with, belief, in, the, independent, existence, of, the, world, and, created, a, thoroughgoing, idealist, philosophy, the, most, notable, work, of, absolute, idealism, was, g, w, f, hegel, s, phenomenology, of, spirit, of, 1807, hegel, admitted, his, ideas, were, not, new, but, that, all, the, previous, philosophies, had, been, incomplete, his, goal, was, to, correctly, finish, their, job, hegel, asserts, that, the, twin, aims, of, philosophy, are, to, account, for, the, contradictions, apparent, in, human, experience, which, arise, for, instance, out, of, the, supposed, contradictions, between, being, and, not, being, and, also, simultaneously, to, resolve, and, preserve, these, contradictions, by, showing, their, compatibility, at, a, higher, level, of, examination, being, and, not, being, are, resolved, with, becoming, this, program, of, acceptance, and, reconciliation, of, contradictions, is, known, as, the, hegelian, dialectic, philosophers, influenced, by, hegel, include, ludwig, feuerbach, who, coined, the, term, projection, as, pertaining, to, humans, inability, to, recognize, anything, in, the, external, world, without, projecting, qualities, of, ourselves, upon, those, things, karl, marx, friedrich, engels, and, the, british, idealists, notably, t, h, green, j, m, e, mctaggart, f, h, bradley, and, r, g, collingwood, few, 20th, century, philosophers, embraced, the, core, tenets, of, german, idealism, after, the, demise, of, british, idealism, however, quite, a, few, have, embraced, hegelian, dialectic, most, notably, frankfurt, school, critical, theorists, alexandre, koj, ve, jean, paul, sartre, in, his, critique, of, dialectical, reason, and, slavoj, i, ek, a, central, theme, of, german, idealism, the, legitimacy, of, kant, s, copernican, revolution, remains, an, important, point, of, contention, in, 21st, century, post, continental, philosophy, late, modern, philosophy, is, usually, considered, to, begin, around, the, pivotal, year, of, 1781, when, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, died, and, immanuel, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, appeared, the, 19th, century, saw, the, beginnings, of, what, would, later, grow, into, the, divide, between, continental, and, analytic, traditions, of, philosophy, with, the, former, more, interested, in, general, frameworks, of, metaphysics, more, common, in, the, german, speaking, world, and, the, latter, focusing, on, issues, of, epistemology, ethics, law, and, politics, more, common, in, the, english, speaking, world, german, philosophy, exercised, broad, influence, in, this, century, owing, in, part, to, the, dominance, of, the, german, university, system, german, idealists, such, as, johann, gottlieb, fichte, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, schelling, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, and, the, members, of, jena, romanticism, friedrich, h, lderlin, novalis, and, karl, wilhelm, friedrich, schlegel, transformed, the, work, of, kant, by, maintaining, that, the, world, is, constituted, by, a, rational, or, mind, like, process, and, as, such, is, entirely, knowable, hegel, argued, that, history, was, the, dialectical, journey, of, the, geist, universal, mind, towards, self, fulfilment, and, self, realization, the, geist, s, self, awareness, is, absolute, knowledge, which, itself, brings, complete, freedom, his, philosophy, was, based, on, absolute, idealism, with, reality, itself, being, mental, his, legacy, was, divided, between, the, conservative, right, hegelians, and, radical, young, hegelians, with, the, latter, including, david, strauss, and, ludwig, feuerbach, feuerbach, argued, for, a, materialist, conception, of, hegel, s, thought, inspiring, karl, marx, arthur, schopenhauer, was, inspired, by, kant, and, indian, philosophy, accepting, kant, s, division, of, the, world, into, the, noumenal, the, real, and, phenomenal, the, apparent, realities, he, nevertheless, disagreed, on, the, accessibility, of, the, former, arguing, that, it, could, in, fact, be, accessed, the, experience, of, will, was, how, this, reality, was, accessible, with, the, will, underlying, the, whole, of, nature, with, everything, else, being, appearance, whereas, he, believed, the, frustration, of, this, will, was, the, cause, of, suffering, friedrich, nietzsche, thought, that, the, will, to, power, was, empowering, leading, to, growth, and, expansion, and, therefore, forming, the, basis, of, ethics, jeremy, bentham, established, utilitarianism, which, was, a, consequentialist, ethic, based, on, the, greatest, happiness, for, the, greatest, number, an, idea, taken, from, cesare, beccaria, he, believed, that, any, act, could, be, measured, by, its, value, in, this, regard, through, the, application, of, felicific, calculus, his, associate, james, mill, s, son, john, stuart, mill, subsequently, took, up, his, thought, however, in, contrast, to, the, valuation, of, pure, pleasure, in, bentham, s, work, mill, divided, pleasures, into, higher, and, lower, kinds, logic, began, a, period, of, its, most, significant, advances, since, the, inception, of, the, discipline, as, increasing, mathematical, precision, opened, entire, fields, of, inference, to, formalization, in, the, work, of, george, boole, and, gottlob, frege, other, philosophers, who, initiated, lines, of, thought, that, would, continue, to, shape, philosophy, into, the, 20th, century, include, pragmatism, is, a, philosophical, tradition, that, began, in, the, united, states, around, 1870, it, asserts, that, the, truth, of, beliefs, consists, in, their, usefulness, and, efficacy, rather, than, their, correspondence, with, reality, charles, sanders, peirce, and, william, james, were, its, co, founders, and, it, was, later, modified, by, john, dewey, as, instrumentalism, since, the, usefulness, of, any, belief, at, any, time, might, be, contingent, on, circumstance, peirce, and, james, conceptualized, final, truth, as, something, established, only, by, the, future, final, settlement, of, all, opinion, pragmatism, attempted, to, find, a, scientific, concept, of, truth, that, does, not, depend, on, personal, insight, revelation, or, reference, to, some, metaphysical, realm, it, interpreted, the, meaning, of, a, statement, by, the, effect, its, acceptance, would, have, on, practice, inquiry, taken, far, enough, is, thus, the, only, path, to, truth, for, peirce, commitment, to, inquiry, was, essential, to, truth, finding, implied, by, the, idea, and, hope, that, inquiry, is, not, fruitless, the, interpretation, of, these, principles, has, been, subject, to, discussion, ever, since, peirce, s, maxim, of, pragmatism, is, consider, what, effects, which, might, conceivably, have, practical, bearings, we, conceive, the, object, of, our, conception, to, have, then, our, conception, of, these, effects, is, the, whole, of, our, conception, of, the, object, critics, accused, pragmatism, falling, victim, to, a, simple, fallacy, that, because, something, that, is, true, proves, useful, that, usefulness, is, an, appropriate, basis, for, its, truthfulness, pragmatist, thinkers, include, dewey, george, santayana, and, c, i, lewis, pragmatism, was, later, worked, on, by, neopragmatists, richard, rorty, who, was, the, first, to, develop, neopragmatist, philosophy, in, his, philosophy, and, the, mirror, of, nature, 1979, hilary, putnam, w, v, o, quine, and, donald, davidson, neopragmatism, has, been, described, as, a, bridge, between, analytic, and, continental, philosophy, the, three, major, contemporary, approaches, to, academic, philosophy, are, analytic, philosophy, continental, philosophy, and, pragmatism, they, are, neither, exhaustive, nor, mutually, exclusive, the, 20th, century, deals, with, the, upheavals, produced, by, a, series, of, conflicts, within, philosophical, discourse, over, the, basis, of, knowledge, with, classical, certainties, overthrown, and, new, social, economic, scientific, and, logical, problems, 20th, century, philosophy, was, set, for, a, series, of, attempts, to, reform, and, preserve, and, to, alter, or, abolish, older, knowledge, systems, seminal, figures, include, bertrand, russell, ludwig, wittgenstein, edmund, husserl, martin, heidegger, and, jean, paul, sartre, the, publication, of, husserl, s, logical, investigations, 1900, 1, and, russell, s, the, principles, of, mathematics, 1903, is, considered, to, mark, the, beginning, of, 20th, century, philosophy, the, 20th, century, also, saw, the, increasing, professionalization, of, the, discipline, and, the, beginning, of, the, current, contemporary, era, of, philosophy, since, the, second, world, war, contemporary, philosophy, has, been, divided, mostly, into, analytic, and, continental, traditions, the, former, carried, in, the, english, speaking, world, and, the, latter, on, the, continent, of, europe, the, perceived, conflict, between, continental, and, analytic, schools, of, philosophy, remains, prominent, despite, increasing, skepticism, regarding, the, distinction, s, usefulness, in, the, english, speaking, world, analytic, philosophy, became, the, dominant, school, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, the, term, analytic, philosophy, roughly, designates, a, group, of, philosophical, methods, that, stress, detailed, argumentation, attention, to, semantics, use, of, classical, logic, and, non, classical, logic, and, clarity, of, meaning, above, all, other, criteria, though, the, movement, has, broadened, it, was, a, cohesive, school, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, analytic, philosophers, were, shaped, strongly, by, logical, positivism, united, by, the, notion, that, philosophical, problems, could, and, should, be, solved, by, attention, to, logic, and, language, gottlob, frege, s, the, foundations, of, arithmetic, 1884, was, the, first, analytic, work, according, to, michael, dummett, origins, of, analytical, philosophy, 1993, frege, was, the, first, to, take, the, linguistic, turn, analyzing, philosophical, problems, through, language, he, invented, a, formal, notational, system, for, logic, his, stance, was, one, of, anti, psychologism, arguing, that, logical, truths, were, independent, of, the, human, minds, discovering, them, bertrand, russell, and, g, e, moore, are, also, often, counted, as, founders, of, analytic, philosophy, they, believed, that, philosophy, should, be, based, on, analysing, propositions, russell, wrote, principia, mathematica, with, alfred, north, whitehead, to, apply, this, to, mathematics, while, moore, did, the, same, for, ethics, with, principia, ethica, russell, s, attempts, to, find, a, foundation, for, mathematics, led, him, to, russell, s, paradox, which, caused, frege, to, abandon, logicism, russell, espoused, logical, atomism, declaring, that, logic, is, the, essence, of, philosophy, in, his, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, ludwig, wittgenstein, put, forward, a, refined, version, of, this, view, wittgenstein, russell, s, disciple, argued, that, the, problems, of, philosophy, were, simply, products, of, language, which, were, actually, meaningless, this, was, based, on, the, picture, theory, of, meaning, wittgenstein, later, changed, his, conception, of, how, language, works, arguing, instead, that, it, has, many, different, uses, which, he, called, different, language, games, the, logical, positivists, of, the, vienna, circle, started, as, a, study, group, of, russell, and, whitehead, they, argued, that, the, arguments, of, metaphysics, ethics, and, theology, were, meaningless, as, they, were, not, logically, or, empirically, verifiable, this, was, based, on, their, division, of, meaningful, statements, into, either, the, analytic, logical, and, mathematical, statements, and, the, synthetic, scientific, claims, moritz, schlick, and, rudolf, carnap, argued, that, science, rested, at, its, roots, on, direct, observation, but, otto, neurath, noted, that, observation, already, requires, theory, in, order, to, have, meaning, another, participant, in, the, circle, was, carnap, s, self, confessed, disciple, willard, van, orman, quine, in, two, dogmas, of, empiricism, quine, criticized, the, distinction, between, analytic, and, synthetic, statements, instead, he, advocated, for, a, web, of, belief, approach, whereby, all, beliefs, come, from, contact, with, reality, including, mathematical, ones, but, with, some, being, further, removed, from, this, contact, than, others, another, former, participant, in, the, circle, was, karl, popper, he, argued, that, verificationism, was, logically, incoherent, promoting, instead, falsificationism, as, the, basis, for, science, a, further, advancement, in, the, philosophy, of, science, was, made, by, imre, lakatos, who, argued, that, negative, findings, in, individual, tests, did, not, falsify, theories, but, rather, entire, research, programmes, would, eventually, fail, explain, phenomena, thomas, kuhn, further, argued, that, science, was, composed, of, paradigms, which, would, eventually, shift, when, evidence, accumulated, against, them, based, on, the, idea, that, different, paradigms, had, different, meanings, of, expressions, paul, feyerabend, went, further, in, arguing, for, relativism, in, science, wittgenstein, had, first, brought, up, the, idea, that, ordinary, language, could, solve, philosophical, problems, a, loosely, associated, group, of, philosophers, later, became, known, as, practitioners, of, ordinary, language, philosophy, it, included, gilbert, ryle, j, l, austin, r, m, hare, and, p, f, strawson, they, believed, that, as, philosophy, was, not, science, it, could, only, be, advanced, through, careful, conceptual, clarification, and, connection, instead, of, observation, and, experimentation, however, they, had, given, up, the, earlier, analytic, pursuit, of, using, formal, logic, to, express, an, ideal, language, but, did, nevertheless, share, the, scepticism, of, metaphysical, grand, theories, unlike, wittgenstein, they, believed, only, some, problems, of, philosophy, to, be, artifacts, of, language, this, approach, has, been, described, as, the, linguistic, turn, of, analytic, philosophy, ryle, introduced, the, concept, of, category, mistake, which, described, the, misapplication, of, a, concept, in, the, wrong, context, which, he, accused, descartes, of, doing, with, the, ghost, in, the, machine, one, of, austin, s, key, insights, was, that, some, language, perform, a, perlocutionary, function, creating, by, themselves, an, effect, on, the, world, thereby, being, speech, acts, this, idea, was, later, taken, up, by, john, searle, in, the, final, third, of, the, 20th, century, philosophy, of, language, emerged, as, its, own, programme, the, theory, of, meaning, became, central, to, this, programme, donald, davidson, argued, that, meaning, could, be, understood, through, a, theory, of, truth, this, was, based, on, the, work, of, alfred, tarski, empirically, davidson, would, find, the, meaning, of, words, in, different, languages, by, linking, them, with, the, objective, conditions, of, their, utterance, which, established, their, truthness, meaning, therefore, emerges, from, the, consensus, of, interpretations, of, speaker, behaviour, michael, dummett, argued, against, this, view, on, the, basis, of, its, realism, this, was, because, realism, would, make, the, truthness, of, many, sentences, beyond, measurability, instead, he, argued, for, verifiability, based, on, the, idea, that, one, could, recognise, the, proof, of, truth, when, offered, it, alternative, to, these, paul, grice, put, forward, a, theory, that, meaning, was, based, on, the, intention, of, the, speaker, which, over, time, becomes, established, after, repeated, use, theories, of, reference, were, another, major, strand, of, thought, on, language, frege, had, argued, that, proper, names, were, linked, to, its, referent, through, a, description, of, what, the, name, refers, to, russell, agreed, with, this, adding, that, this, can, replace, a, description, in, cases, of, familiarity, later, searle, and, strawson, expanded, these, ideas, by, noting, that, a, cluster, of, descriptions, each, of, them, usable, may, be, used, by, linguistic, communities, keith, donnellan, further, argued, that, sometimes, a, description, could, be, wrong, but, still, make, the, correct, reference, this, being, different, from, the, attributive, use, of, a, description, he, as, well, as, saul, kripke, and, hilary, putnam, independently, argued, that, often, the, referents, of, proper, names, are, not, based, on, description, but, rather, on, a, history, of, usage, passing, through, users, towards, the, end, of, the, century, philosophy, of, language, began, to, diverge, in, two, directions, the, philosophy, of, mind, and, more, specific, study, of, particular, aspects, of, language, the, latter, supported, by, linguistics, early, identity, theories, of, mind, in, the, 1950s, and, 60s, were, based, on, the, work, of, ullin, place, herbert, feigl, and, j, j, c, smart, while, earlier, philosophers, such, as, the, logical, positivists, quine, wittgenstein, and, ryle, had, all, used, some, form, of, behaviorism, to, dispense, with, the, mental, they, believed, that, behaviorism, was, insufficient, in, explaining, many, aspects, of, mental, phenomena, feigl, argued, that, intentional, states, could, not, be, thus, explained, instead, he, espoused, externalism, place, meanwhile, argued, that, the, mind, could, be, reduced, to, physical, events, while, feigl, and, sense, agreed, they, were, identical, functionalism, in, contrast, argued, that, the, mind, was, defined, by, what, it, does, rather, than, what, it, is, based, on, to, argue, against, this, john, searle, developed, the, chinese, room, thought, experiment, davidson, argued, for, anomalous, monism, which, claims, that, while, mental, events, cause, physical, ones, and, the, all, causal, relations, are, governed, by, natural, laws, there, are, however, no, natural, laws, governing, the, causality, between, mental, and, physical, events, this, anomaly, in, the, name, was, explained, by, supervenience, in, 1970, keith, campbell, proposed, a, new, epiphenomenalism, according, to, which, the, body, produces, the, mind, that, does, not, act, on, the, body, a, process, which, he, claims, is, destined, to, remain, mysterious, paul, churchland, and, patricia, churchland, argued, for, eliminative, materialism, which, claims, that, understanding, the, brain, will, lead, to, a, complete, understanding, of, the, mind, this, was, based, on, developments, in, neuroscience, however, physicalist, theories, of, mind, have, had, to, grapple, with, the, issue, of, subjective, experience, raised, by, thomas, nagel, in, what, is, it, like, to, be, a, bat, and, frank, cameron, jackson, s, so, called, knowledge, argument, david, chalmers, also, argued, against, physicalism, in, the, philosophical, zombie, argument, he, further, noted, that, subjective, experience, posed, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, the, inability, of, physicalist, theories, to, explain, conscious, feeling, has, been, termed, the, explanatory, gap, in, contrast, daniel, dennett, has, claimed, that, no, such, gap, exists, as, subjective, experiences, are, a, philosophical, fiction, ethics, in, 20th, century, analytic, philosophy, has, been, argued, to, have, begun, with, moore, s, principia, ethica, moore, argued, that, what, is, good, cannot, be, defined, instead, he, saw, ethical, behaviour, a, result, of, intuition, which, led, to, non, cognitivism, w, d, ross, in, contrast, argued, that, duty, formed, the, basis, for, ethics, russell, s, meta, ethical, thought, anticipated, emotivism, and, error, theory, this, was, supported, by, the, logical, positivists, and, later, popularised, by, a, j, ayer, charles, stevenson, also, argued, that, ethical, terms, were, expressions, of, emotive, meanings, by, speakers, r, m, hare, aimed, to, expand, their, meaning, from, mere, expressions, to, also, being, prescriptions, which, are, universalizable, j, l, mackie, supported, error, theory, on, the, basis, that, objective, values, do, not, exist, as, they, are, culturally, relative, and, would, be, metaphysically, strange, another, strand, of, ethical, thinking, began, with, g, e, m, anscombe, arguing, in, 1958, that, both, consequentialism, and, deontology, were, based, on, obligation, which, could, not, function, without, divine, authority, instead, promoting, virtue, ethics, other, notable, virtue, ethicists, included, philippa, foot, and, alasdair, macintyre, the, latter, combined, it, with, communitarianism, notable, students, of, quine, include, donald, davidson, and, daniel, dennett, the, later, work, of, russell, and, the, philosophy, of, willard, van, orman, quine, are, influential, exemplars, of, the, naturalist, approach, dominant, in, analytic, philosophy, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, but, the, diversity, of, analytic, philosophy, from, the, 1970s, onward, defies, easy, generalization, the, naturalism, of, quine, and, his, epigoni, was, in, some, precincts, superseded, by, a, new, metaphysics, of, possible, worlds, as, in, the, influential, work, of, david, lewis, recently, the, experimental, philosophy, movement, has, sought, to, reappraise, philosophical, problems, through, social, science, research, techniques, some, influential, figures, in, contemporary, analytic, philosophy, are, timothy, williamson, david, lewis, john, searle, thomas, nagel, hilary, putnam, michael, dummett, john, mcdowell, saul, kripke, peter, van, inwagen, and, patricia, churchland, analytic, philosophy, has, sometimes, been, accused, of, not, contributing, to, the, political, debate, or, to, traditional, questions, in, aesthetics, however, with, the, appearance, of, a, theory, of, justice, by, john, rawls, and, anarchy, state, and, utopia, by, robert, nozick, analytic, political, philosophy, acquired, respectability, analytic, philosophers, have, also, shown, depth, in, their, investigations, of, aesthetics, with, roger, scruton, nelson, goodman, arthur, danto, and, others, developing, the, subject, to, its, current, shape, continental, philosophy, is, a, set, of, 19th, and, 20th, century, philosophical, traditions, from, mainland, europe, 20th, century, movements, such, as, german, idealism, phenomenology, existentialism, modern, hermeneutics, the, theory, and, methodology, of, interpretation, critical, theory, structuralism, post, structuralism, and, others, are, included, within, this, loose, category, while, identifying, any, non, trivial, common, factor, in, all, these, schools, of, thought, is, bound, to, be, controversial, michael, e, rosen, has, hypothesized, a, few, common, continental, themes, that, the, natural, sciences, cannot, replace, the, human, sciences, that, the, thinker, is, affected, by, the, conditions, of, experience, one, s, place, and, time, in, history, that, philosophy, is, both, theoretical, and, practical, that, metaphilosophy, or, reflection, upon, the, methods, and, nature, of, philosophy, itself, is, an, important, part, of, philosophy, proper, the, founder, of, phenomenology, edmund, husserl, sought, to, study, consciousness, as, experienced, from, a, first, person, perspective, while, martin, heidegger, drew, on, the, ideas, of, kierkegaard, nietzsche, and, husserl, to, propose, an, unconventional, existential, approach, to, ontology, phenomenologically, oriented, metaphysics, undergirded, existentialism, martin, heidegger, jean, paul, sartre, maurice, merleau, ponty, albert, camus, and, finally, post, structuralism, gilles, deleuze, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, best, known, for, his, articulation, of, postmodernism, michel, foucault, jacques, derrida, best, known, for, developing, a, form, of, semiotic, analysis, known, as, deconstruction, the, psychoanalytic, work, of, sigmund, freud, carl, jung, jacques, lacan, julia, kristeva, and, others, has, also, been, influential, in, contemporary, continental, thought, conversely, some, philosophers, have, attempted, to, define, and, rehabilitate, older, traditions, of, philosophy, most, notably, hans, georg, gadamer, and, alasdair, macintyre, have, both, albeit, in, different, ways, revived, the, tradition, of, aristotelianism, existentialism, is, a, term, applied, to, the, work, of, a, number, of, late, 19th, and, 20th, century, philosophers, who, despite, profound, doctrinal, differences, shared, the, belief, that, philosophical, thinking, begins, with, the, human, subject, not, merely, the, thinking, subject, but, the, acting, feeling, living, human, individual, in, existentialism, the, individual, s, starting, point, is, characterized, by, what, has, been, called, the, existential, attitude, or, a, sense, of, disorientation, and, confusion, in, the, face, of, an, apparently, meaningless, or, absurd, world, many, existentialists, have, also, regarded, traditional, systematic, or, academic, philosophy, in, both, style, and, content, as, too, abstract, and, remote, from, concrete, human, experience, although, they, did, not, use, the, term, the, 19th, century, philosophers, s, ren, kierkegaard, and, friedrich, nietzsche, are, widely, regarded, as, the, fathers, of, existentialism, their, influence, however, has, extended, beyond, existentialist, thought, marxism, is, a, method, of, socioeconomic, analysis, originating, from, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, it, analyzes, class, relations, and, societal, conflict, using, a, materialist, interpretation, of, historical, development, and, a, dialectical, view, of, social, transformation, marxist, analyses, and, methodologies, influenced, political, ideologies, and, social, movements, marxist, understandings, of, history, and, society, were, adopted, by, academics, in, archeology, anthropology, media, studies, political, science, theater, history, sociology, art, history, and, theory, cultural, studies, education, economics, geography, literary, criticism, aesthetics, critical, psychology, and, philosophy, in, contemporary, philosophy, the, term, critical, theory, describes, the, western, marxist, philosophy, of, the, frankfurt, school, which, was, developed, in, germany, in, the, 1930s, critical, theory, maintains, that, ideology, is, the, principal, obstacle, to, human, emancipation, edmund, husserl, s, phenomenology, was, an, ambitious, attempt, to, lay, the, foundations, for, an, account, of, the, structure, of, conscious, experience, in, general, an, important, part, of, husserl, s, phenomenological, project, was, to, show, that, all, conscious, acts, are, directed, at, or, about, objective, content, a, feature, that, husserl, called, intentionality, husserl, published, only, a, few, works, in, his, lifetime, which, treat, phenomenology, mainly, in, abstract, methodological, terms, but, he, left, an, enormous, quantity, of, unpublished, concrete, analyses, husserl, s, work, was, immediately, influential, in, germany, with, the, foundation, of, phenomenological, schools, in, munich, munich, phenomenology, and, g, ttingen, g, ttingen, phenomenology, phenomenology, later, achieved, international, fame, through, the, work, of, such, philosophers, as, martin, heidegger, formerly,

structuralism, sought, to, clarify, systems, of, signs, through, analyzing, the, discourses, they, both, limit, and, make, possible, saussure, conceived, of, the, sign, as, being, delimited, by, all, the, other, signs, in, the, system, and, ideas, as, being, incapable, of, existence, prior, to, linguistic, structure, which, articulates, thought, this, led, continental, thought, away, from,

the, province, of, a, hard, science, but, its, positivism, soon, came, under, fire, by, post, structuralism, a, wide, field, of, thinkers, some, of, whom, were, once, themselves, structuralists, but, later, came, to, criticize, it, structuralists, believed, they, could, analyze, systems, from, an, external, objective, standing, for, example, but, the, poststructuralists, argued, that, this, is, incorrect, that, one, cannot, transcend, structures, and, thus, analysis, is, itself, determined, by, what, it, examines, while, the, distinction, between, the, signifier, and, signified, was, treated, as, crystalline, by, structuralists, poststructuralists, asserted, that, every, attempt, to, grasp, the, signified, results, in, more, signifiers, so, meaning, is, always, in, a, state, of, being, deferred, making, an, ultimate, interpretation, impossible, structuralism, came, to, dominate, continental, philosophy, throughout, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, encompassing, thinkers, as, diverse, as, claude, l, vi, strauss, roland, barthes, and, jacques, lacan, post, structuralism, came, to, predominate, from, the, 1970s, onwards, including, thinkers, such, as, michel, foucault, jacques, derrida, gilles, deleuze, and, even, roland, barthes, it, incorporated, a, critique, of, structuralism, s, limitations, process, philosophy, is, a, tradition, beginning, with, alfred, north, whitehead, who, began, teaching, and, writing, on, process, and, metaphysics, when, he, joined, harvard, university, in, 1924, this, tradition, identifies, metaphysical, reality, with, change, process, philosophy, is, sometimes, classified, as, closer, to, continental, philosophy, than, analytic, philosophy, because, it, is, usually, only, taught, in, continental, departments, however, other, sources, state, that, process, philosophy, should, be, placed, somewhere, in, the, middle, between, the, poles, of, analytic, versus, continental, methods, in, contemporary, philosophy, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, pyrrho, accompanied, alexander, the, great, in, his, eastern, campaigns, spending, about, 18, months, in, india, pyrrho, subsequently, returned, to, greece, and, founded, pyrrhonism, a, philosophy, with, substantial, similarities, with, buddhism, the, greek, biographer, diogenes, la, rtius, explained, that, pyrrho, s, equanimity, and, detachment, from, the, world, were, acquired, in, india, pyrrho, was, directly, influenced, by, buddhism, in, developing, his, philosophy, which, is, based, on, pyrrho, s, interpretation, of, the, buddhist, three, marks, of, existence, according, to, edward, conze, pyrrhonism, can, be, compared, to, buddhist, philosophy, especially, the, indian, madhyamika, school, the, pyrrhonists, goal, of, ataraxia, the, state, of, being, untroubled, is, a, soteriological, goal, similar, to, nirvana, the, pyrrhonists, promoted, suspending, judgment, epoch, about, dogma, beliefs, about, non, evident, matters, as, the, way, to, reach, ataraxia, this, is, similar, to, the, buddha, s, refusal, to, answer, certain, metaphysical, questions, which, he, saw, as, non, conductive, to, the, path, of, buddhist, practice, and, nagarjuna, s, relinquishing, of, all, views, drsti, adrian, kuzminski, argues, for, direct, influence, between, these, two, systems, of, thought, in, pyrrhonism, how, the, ancient, greeks, reinvented, buddhism, according, to, kuzminski, both, philosophies, argue, against, assenting, to, any, dogmatic, assertions, about, an, ultimate, metaphysical, reality, behind, our, sense, impressions, as, a, tactic, to, reach, tranquility, and, both, also, make, use, of, logical, arguments, against, other, philosophies, in, order, to, expose, their, contradictions, the, cyrenaic, philosopher, hegesias, of, cyrene, is, thought, by, some, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, teachings, of, ashoka, s, buddhist, missionaries, empiricist, philosophers, such, as, hume, and, berkeley, favoured, the, bundle, theory, of, personal, identity, in, this, theory, the, mind, is, simply, a, bundle, of, perceptions, without, unity, one, interpretation, of, hume, s, view, of, the, self, argued, for, by, philosopher, and, psychologist, james, giles, is, that, hume, is, not, arguing, for, a, bundle, theory, which, is, a, form, of, reductionism, but, rather, for, an, eliminative, view, of, the, self, rather, than, reducing, the, self, to, a, bundle, of, perceptions, hume, rejects, the, idea, of, the, self, altogether, on, this, interpretation, hume, is, proposing, a, no, self, theory, and, thus, has, much, in, common, with, buddhist, thought, see, anatt, psychologist, alison, gopnik, has, argued, that, hume, was, in, a, position, to, learn, about, buddhist, thought, during, his, time, in, france, in, the, 1730s
