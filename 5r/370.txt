in, greco, roman, mythology, aeneas, n, i, s, ih, nee, s, latin, from, ancient, greek, romanized, aine, s, was, a, trojan, hero, the, son, of, the, trojan, prince, anchises, and, the, greek, goddess, aphrodite, equivalent, to, the, roman, venus, his, father, was, a, first, cousin, of, king, priam, of, troy, both, being, grandsons, of, ilus, founder, of, troy, making, aeneas, a, second, cousin, to, priam, s, children, such, as, hector, and, paris, he, is, a, minor, character, in, greek, mythology, and, is, mentioned, in, homer, s, iliad, aeneas, receives, full, treatment, in, roman, mythology, most, extensively, in, virgil, s, aeneid, where, he, is, cast, as, an, ancestor, of, romulus, and, remus, he, became, the, first, true, hero, of, rome, snorri, sturluson, identifies, him, with, the, norse, god, v, arr, of, the, sir, aeneas, is, the, romanization, of, the, hero, s, original, greek, name, aine, as, aine, as, is, first, introduced, in, the, homeric, hymn, to, aphrodite, when, aphrodite, gives, him, his, name, from, the, adjective, ainon, terrible, for, the, terrible, grief, he, has, caused, her, by, being, born, a, mortal, who, will, age, and, die, it, is, a, popular, etymology, for, the, name, apparently, exploited, by, homer, in, the, iliad, later, in, the, medieval, period, there, were, writers, who, held, that, because, the, aeneid, was, written, by, a, philosopher, it, is, meant, to, be, read, philosophically, as, such, in, the, natural, order, the, meaning, of, aeneas, name, combines, greek, ennos, dweller, with, demas, body, which, becomes, ennaios, or, in, dweller, i, e, as, a, god, inhabiting, a, mortal, body, however, there, is, no, certainty, regarding, the, origin, of, his, name, in, imitation, of, the, iliad, virgil, borrows, epithets, of, homer, including, anchisiades, magnanimum, magnus, heros, and, bonus, though, he, borrows, many, virgil, gives, aeneas, two, epithets, of, his, own, in, the, aeneid, pater, and, pius, the, epithets, applied, by, virgil, are, an, example, of, an, attitude, different, from, that, of, homer, for, whilst, odysseus, is, poikilios, wily, aeneas, is, described, as, pius, pious, which, conveys, a, strong, moral, tone, the, purpose, of, these, epithets, seems, to, enforce, the, notion, of, aeneas, divine, hand, as, father, and, founder, of, the, roman, race, and, their, use, seems, circumstantial, when, aeneas, is, praying, he, refers, to, himself, as, pius, and, is, referred, to, as, such, by, the, author, only, when, the, character, is, acting, on, behalf, of, the, gods, to, fulfill, his, divine, mission, likewise, aeneas, is, called, pater, when, acting, in, the, interest, of, his, men, the, story, of, the, birth, of, aeneas, is, told, in, the, homeric, hymn, to, aphrodite, one, of, the, major, homeric, hymns, aphrodite, has, caused, zeus, the, king, of, the, gods, to, fall, in, love, with, mortal, women, in, retaliation, zeus, decided, to, put, a, desire, over, her, heart, for, the, mortal, prince, anchises, who, is, tending, his, cattle, among, the, hills, near, mount, ida, when, aphrodite, saw, him, she, was, immediately, smitten, she, adorns, herself, as, if, for, a, wedding, among, the, gods, and, appears, before, him, he, is, overcome, by, her, beauty, believing, that, she, is, a, goddess, but, aphrodite, identifies, herself, as, a, phrygian, princess, after, they, make, love, aphrodite, reveals, her, true, identity, to, him, and, anchises, fears, what, might, happen, to, him, as, a, result, of, their, liaison, aphrodite, assures, him, that, he, will, be, protected, and, tells, him, that, she, will, bear, him, a, son, to, be, called, aeneas, however, she, warns, him, that, he, must, never, tell, anyone, that, he, has, lain, with, a, goddess, when, aeneas, is, born, aphrodite, takes, him, to, the, nymphs, of, mount, ida, instructing, them, to, raise, the, child, to, age, five, then, take, him, to, anchises, according, to, other, sources, anchises, later, brags, about, his, encounter, with, aphrodite, and, as, a, result, is, struck, in, the, foot, with, a, thunderbolt, by, zeus, thereafter, he, is, lame, in, that, foot, so, that, aeneas, has, to, carry, him, from, the, flames, of, troy, aeneas, is, a, minor, character, in, the, iliad, where, he, is, twice, saved, from, death, by, the, gods, as, if, for, an, as, yet, unknown, destiny, but, is, an, honorable, warrior, in, his, own, right, having, held, back, from, the, fighting, aggrieved, with, priam, because, in, spite, of, his, brave, deeds, he, was, not, given, his, due, share, of, honor, he, leads, an, attack, against, idomeneus, to, recover, the, body, of, his, brother, in, law, alcathous, at, the, urging, of, deiphobus, he, is, the, leader, of, the, trojans, dardanian, allies, as, well, as, a, second, cousin, and, principal, lieutenant, of, hector, son, and, heir, of, the, trojan, king, priam, aeneas, s, mother, aphrodite, frequently, comes, to, his, aid, on, the, battlefield, and, he, is, a, favorite, of, the, sun, god, apollo, aphrodite, and, apollo, would, frequently, rescue, aeneas, from, combat, with, diomedes, of, argos, who, nearly, kills, him, and, carry, him, away, to, pergamos, for, healing, even, the, sea, god, poseidon, who, usually, favors, the, greeks, comes, to, aeneas, s, rescue, after, he, falls, under, the, assault, of, achilles, noting, that, aeneas, though, from, a, junior, branch, of, the, royal, family, is, destined, to, become, king, of, the, trojan, people, bruce, louden, presents, aeneas, as, type, the, sole, virtuous, individual, or, family, spared, from, general, destruction, following, the, mytheme, of, utnapishtim, baucis, and, philemon, noah, and, lot, pseudo, apollodorus, in, his, bibliotheca, explains, that, the, greeks, him, alone, on, account, of, his, piety, the, roman, mythographer, gaius, julius, hyginus, c, 64, bce, ce, 17, in, his, fabulae, credits, aeneas, with, killing, 28, enemies, in, the, trojan, war, aeneas, also, appears, in, the, trojan, narratives, attributed, to, dares, phrygius, and, dictys, of, crete, the, history, of, aeneas, was, continued, by, roman, authors, one, influential, source, was, the, account, of, rome, s, founding, in, cato, the, elder, s, origines, the, aeneas, legend, was, well, known, in, virgil, s, day, and, appeared, in, various, historical, works, including, the, roman, antiquities, of, the, greek, historian, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, relying, on, marcus, terentius, varro, ab, urbe, condita, by, livy, probably, dependent, on, quintus, fabius, pictor, fl, 200, bce, and, gnaeus, pompeius, trogus, now, extant, only, in, an, epitome, by, justin, the, aeneid, which, is, 12, books, of, the, legendary, foundation, of, lavinium, which, explains, that, aeneas, is, one, of, the, few, trojans, who, were, not, killed, or, enslaved, when, troy, fell, aeneas, after, being, commanded, by, the, gods, to, flee, gathered, a, group, collectively, known, as, the, aeneads, who, then, traveled, to, italy, and, became, progenitors, of, the, romans, the, aeneads, included, aeneas, s, trumpeter, misenus, his, father, anchises, his, friends, achates, sergestus, and, acmon, the, healer, iapyx, the, helmsman, palinurus, and, his, son, ascanius, also, known, as, iulus, julus, or, ascanius, julius, he, carried, with,

sicily, where, in, drepanum, on, the, island, s, western, coast, his, father, anchises, died, peacefully, after, a, brief, but, fierce, storm, sent, up, against, the, group, at, juno, s, request, aeneas, and, his, fleet, made, landfall, at, carthage, after, six, years, of, wanderings, aeneas, had, a, year, long, affair, with, the, carthaginian, queen, dido, also, known, as, elissa, who, proposed, that, the, trojans, settle, in, her, land, and, that, she, and, aeneas, reign, jointly, over, their, peoples, a, marriage, of, sorts, was, arranged, between, dido, and, aeneas, at, the, instigation, of, juno, who, was, told, that, her, favorite, city, would, eventually, be, defeated, by, the, trojans, descendants, aeneas, s, mother, venus, the, roman, adaptation, of, aphrodite, realized, that, her, son, and, his, company, needed, a, temporary, respite, to, reinforce, themselves, for, the, journey, to, come, however, the, messenger, god, mercury, the, adaptation, of, hermes, was, sent, by, jupiter, who, was, zeus, in, this, version, and, venus, to, remind, aeneas, of, his, journey, and, his, purpose, compelling, him, to, leave, secretly, when, dido, learned, of, this, she, uttered, a, curse, that, would, forever, pit, carthage, against, rome, an, enmity, that, would, culminate, in, the, punic, wars, she, then, committed, suicide, by, stabbing, herself, with, the, same, sword, she, gave, aeneas, when, they, first, met, after, the, sojourn, in, carthage, the, trojans, returned, to, sicily, where, aeneas, organized, funeral, games, to, honor, his, father, who, had, died, a, year, before, the, company, traveled, on, and, landed, on, the, western, coast, of, italy, aeneas, descended, into, the, underworld, where, he, met, dido, who, turned, away, from, him,

lavinia, would, be, betrothed, to, one, from, another, land, namely, aeneas, latinus, heeded, the, prophecy, and, turnus, consequently, declared, war, on, aeneas, at, the, urging, of, juno, who, was, aligned, with, king, mezentius, of, the, etruscans, and, queen, amata, of, the, latins, aeneas, s, forces, prevailed, turnus, was, killed, and, virgil, s, account, ends, abruptly, the, rest, of,

founded, the, city, of, lavinium, named, after, his, wife, he, later, welcomed, dido, s, sister, anna, perenna, who, then, committed, suicide, after, learning, of, lavinia, s, jealousy, after, aeneas,

nectar, making, him, a, god, aeneas, was, recognized, as, the, god, jupiter, indiges, it, s, also, been, stated, that, prince, aeneas, is, the, ancestor, to, the, founders, of, rome, the, twin, brothers, romulus, and, remus, the, two, orphan, boys, who, are, seen, suckling, from, a, she, wolf, the, english, once, widely, claimed, as, history, an, original, peopling, of, their, island, prior, to, the, event, a, land, only, of, fantastical, giants, by, descendants, of, aeneas, though, even, in, the, time, of, the, renaissance, a, non, english, audience, as, well, as, at, least, one, english, writer, found, details, of, the, stories, less, than, convincing, the, island, known, later, as, great, britain, was, also, previously, known, as, alba, a, similarity, of, name, supporting, a, connection, with, the, city, of, alba, longa, a, pre, roman, city, in, central, italy, said, to, have, been, built, by, ascanius, son, of, aeneas, and, third, ruler, of, the, latins, after, latinus, being, either, his, grandson, or, step, grandson, even, if, one, ignores, obviously, far, fetched, elements, of, this, foundation, myth, of, britain, johannes, rastell, writing, in, 1529, questioned, along, these, lines, supposing, the, original, brits, were, descendants, of, a, line, of, latin, kings, brute, the, son, of, silvius, son, of, ascanius, son, of, aeneas, who, came, to, the, italian, peninsula, from, troy, then, why, should, such, a, fact, have, escaped, record, in, the, writings, of, julius, caesar, when, that, roman, military, supreme, commander, had, personally, surveyed, the, lands, there, he, had, conquered, for, rome, by, 48, bc, and, indeed, why, should, the, son, brutus, have, escaped, from, latin, histories, altogether, given, that, they, did, deal, with, silvius, and, ascanius, and, all, they, re, childera, what, became, of, them, how, they, endyd, that, succeeded, them, as, kyngis, other, details, rastell, found, were, able, to, be, discounted, without, resort, to, factual, records, or, with, only, very, few, facts, needed, other, than, everyday, experience, were, the, early, inhabitants, of, britain, giants, descended, from, the, devil, in, union, with, 32, daughters, of, a, king, dioclisian, of, syria, to, rastell, if, the, devil, had, power, to, sow, such, seeds, at, the, earlier, time, then, why, not, in, his, own, time, where, were, the, giants, today, other, fanciful, elements, he, deduced, from, intuitive, psychological, insights, for, example, the, greatly, diminished, chance, of, 32, daughters, married, to, 32, kings, on, a, single, day, and, all, cooperating, to, kill, those, 32, husbands, in, a, single, night, or, in, combination, with, analysis, of, logistical, realities, such, as, the, suggested, voyage, of, all, 32, murderous, widows, to, britain, without, dispersion, or, diversion, over, three, thousand, miles, rastell, was, further, able, to, discount, the, likelihood, of, any, factuality, to, that, ancient, tale, due, to, his, failure, to, discover, after, diligent, research, any, authentic, record, of, its, origin, or, explanation, as, to, why, such, record, should, be, absent, snorri, sturlason, in, the, prologue, of, the, prose, edda, tells, of, the, world, as, parted, in, three, continents, africa, asia, and, the, third, part, called, europe, or, enea, snorri, also, tells, of, a, trojan, named, munon, or, mennon, who, marries, the, daughter, of, the, high, king, yfirkonungr, priam, called, troan, and, travels, to, distant, lands, marries, the, sybil, and, got, a, son, tror, who, as, snorri, tells, is, identical, to, thor, this, tale, resembles, some, episodes, of, the, aeneid, continuations, of, trojan, matter, in, the, middle, ages, had, their, effects, on, the, character, of, aeneas, as, well, the, 12th, century, french, roman, d, en, as, addresses, aeneas, s, sexuality, though, virgil, appears, to, deflect, all, homoeroticism, onto, nisus, and, euryalus, making, his, aeneas, a, purely, heterosexual, character, in, the, middle, ages, there, was, at, least, a, suspicion, of, homoeroticism, in, aeneas, the, roman, d, en, as, addresses, that, charge, when, queen, amata, opposes, aeneas, s, marrying, lavinia, medieval, interpretations, of, aeneas, were, greatly, influenced, by, both, virgil, and, other, latin, sources, specifically, the, accounts, by, dares, and, dictys, which, were, reworked, by, the, 13th, century, italian, writer, guido, delle, colonne, in, historia, destructionis, troiae, colored, many, later, readings, from, guido, for, instance, the, pearl, poet, and, other, english, writers, get, the, suggestion, that, aeneas, s, safe, departure, from, troy, with, his, possessions, and, family, was, a, reward, for, treason, for, which, he, was, chastised, by, hecuba, in, sir, gawain, and, the, green, knight, late, 14th, century, the, pearl, poet, like, many, other, english, writers, employed, aeneas, to, establish, a, genealogy, for, the, foundation, of, britain, and, explains, that, aeneas, was, impeached, for, his, perfidy, proven, most, true, line, 4, aeneas, had, an, extensive, family, tree, his, wet, nurse, was, caieta, and, he, is, the, father, of, ascanius, with, creusa, and, of, silvius, with, lavinia, ascanius, also, known, as, iulus, or, julius, founded, alba, longa, and, was, the, first, in, a, long, series, of, kings, according, to, the, mythology, used, by, virgil, in, the, aeneid, romulus, and, remus, were, both, descendants, of, aeneas, through, their, mother, rhea, silvia, making, aeneas, the, progenitor, of, the, roman, people, some, early, sources, call, him, their, father, or, grandfather, but, once, the, dates, of, the, fall, of, troy, 1184, bce, and, the, founding, of, rome, 753, bce, became, accepted, authors, added, generations, between, them, the, julian, family, of, rome, most, notably, julius, c, sar, and, augustus, traced, their, lineage, to, ascanius, and, aeneas, thus, to, the, goddess, venus, through, the, julians, the, palemonids, make, this, claim, the, legendary, kings, of, britain, including, king, arthur, trace, their, family, through, a, grandson, of, aeneas, brutus, aeneas, s, consistent, epithet, in, virgil, and, other, latin, authors, is, pius, a, term, that, connotes, reverence, toward, the, gods, and, familial, dutifulness, there, is, significant, scholarly, debate, however, over, the, degree, to, which, this, epithet, is, genuine, within, the, poem, and, to, what, extent, its, deployment, by, virgil, is, sarcastic, in, the, aeneid, aeneas, is, described, as, strong, and, handsome, but, neither, his, hair, colour, nor, complexion, are, described, in, late, antiquity, however, sources, add, further, physical, descriptions, the, de, excidio, troiae, of, dares, phrygius, describes, aeneas, as, auburn, haired, stocky, eloquent, courteous, prudent, pious, and, charming, his, eyes, were, black, and, twinkling, there, is, also, a, brief, physical,
