faith, is, confidence, or, trust, in, a, person, thing, or, concept, in, the, context, of, religion, faith, is, belief, in, god, or, in, the, doctrines, or, teachings, of, religion, according, to, the, merriam, webster, s, dictionary, faith, has, multiple, definitions, including, something, that, is, believed, especially, with, strong, conviction, complete, trust, belief, and, trust, in, and, loyalty, to, god, as, well, as, a, firm, belief, in, something, for, which, there, is, no, proof, religious, people, often, think, of, faith, as, confidence, based, on, a, perceived, degree, of, warrant, or, evidence, while, others, who, are, more, skeptical, of, religion, tend, to, think, of, faith, as, simply, belief, without, evidence, in, the, roman, world, faith, latin, fides, was, understood, without, particular, association, with, gods, or, beliefs, instead, it, was, understood, as, a, paradoxical, set, of, reciprocal, ideas, voluntary, will, and, voluntary, restraint, in, the, sense, of, father, over, family, or, host, over, guest, whereby, one, party, willfully, surrenders, to, a, party, who, could, harm, but, chooses, not, to, thereby, entrusting, or, confiding, in, them, accordingly, to, thomas, aquinas, faith, is, an, act, of, the, intellect, assenting, to, the, truth, at, the, command, of, the, will, religion, has, a, long, tradition, since, the, ancient, world, of, analyzing, divine, questions, using, common, human, experiences, such, as, sensation, reason, science, and, history, that, do, not, rely, on, revelation, called, natural, theology, the, english, word, faith, finds, its, roots, in, the, proto, indo, european, pie, root, bheidh, signifying, concepts, of, trust, confidence, and, persuasion, this, root, has, given, rise, to, various, terms, across, different, languages, such, as, greek, p, stis, meaning, faith, and, latin, fid, s, meaning, trust, faith, confidence, furthermore, the, proto, indo, european, root, were, o, adds, another, layer, to, the, word, s, etymology, emphasizing, the, notions, of, truth, and, trustworthiness, this, root, is, evident, in, english, words, like, veracity, verity, and, verify, as, well, as, in, latin, with, verus, meaning, true, the, term, faith, in, english, emerged, in, the, mid, 13th, century, evolving, from, anglo, french, and, old, french, forms, like, feid, and, feit, ultimately, tracing, back, to, the, latin, fid, s, this, latin, term, rooted, in, the, pie, root, bheidh, encompassed, meanings, such, as, trust, confidence, and, belief, referring, to, religions, plural, pope, francis, claims, that, the, majority, of, people, living, on, our, planet, profess, to, be, believers, the, word, translated, as, faith, in, english, language, editions, of, the, new, testament, the, greek, word, p, stis, can, also, be, translated, as, belief, faithfulness, or, trust, faith, can, also, be, translated, from, the, greek, verb, pisteuo, meaning, to, trust, to, have, confidence, faithfulness, to, be, reliable, to, assure, christianity, encompasses, various, views, regarding, the, nature, of, faith, some, see, faith, as, being, persuaded, or, convinced, that, something, is, true, in, this, view, a, person, believes, something, when, they, are, presented, with, adequate, evidence, that, it, is, true, the, 13th, century, theologian, saint, thomas, aquinas, did, not, hold, that, faith, is, mere, opinion, on, the, contrary, he, held, that, it, represents, a, mean, understood, in, the, aristotelian, sense, between, excessive, reliance, on, science, i, e, demonstration, and, excessive, reliance, on, opinion, according, to, teresa, morgan, faith, was, understood, by, early, christians, within, the, cultural, milieu, of, the, period, as, a, relationship, that, created, a, community, based, on, trust, instead, of, a, set, of, mental, beliefs, or, feelings, of, the, heart, numerous, commentators, discuss, the, results, of, faith, some, believe, that, true, faith, results, in, good, works, while, others, believe, that, while, faith, in, jesus, brings, eternal, life, it, does, not, necessarily, result, in, good, works, regardless, of, the, approach, taken, to, faith, all, christians, agree, that, the, christian, faith, in, the, sense, of, christian, practice, is, aligned, with, the, ideals, and, the, example, of, the, life, of, jesus, the, christian, contemplates, the, mystery, of, god, and, his, grace, and, seeks, to, know, and, become, obedient, to, god, to, a, christian, the, faith, is, not, static, but, causes, one, to, learn, more, of, god, and, to, grow, in, faith, christian, faith, has, its, origin, in, god, in, christianity, faith, causes, change, as, it, seeks, a, greater, understanding, of, god, faith, is, not, fideism, or, simple, obedience, to, a, set, of, rules, or, statements, before, christians, have, faith, but, they, must, also, understand, in, whom, and, in, what, they, have, faith, without, understanding, there, cannot, be, true, faith, and, that, understanding, is, built, on, the, foundation, of, the, community, of, believers, the, scriptures, and, traditions, and, on, the, personal, experiences, of, the, believer, christians, may, recognize, different, degrees, of, faith, when, they, encourage, each, other, to, and, themselves, strive, to, develop, grow, and, or, deepen, their, faith, this, may, imply, that, one, can, measure, faith, willingness, to, undergo, martyrdom, indicates, a, proxy, for, depth, of, faith, but, does, not, provide, an, everyday, measurement, for, the, average, contemporary, christian, within, the, calvinist, tradition, the, degree, of, prosperity, may, serve, as, an, analog, of, the, level, of, faith, other, christian, strands, may, rely, on, personal, self, evaluation, to, measure, the, intensity, of, an, individual, s, faith, with, associated, difficulties, in, calibrating, to, any, scale, solemn, affirmations, of, a, creed, a, statement, of, faith, provide, broad, measurements, of, details, various, tribunals, of, the, inquisition, however, concerned, themselves, with, precisely, evaluating, the, orthodoxy, of, the, faith, of, those, it, examined, to, acquit, or, to, punish, in, varying, degrees, the, classification, of, different, degrees, of, faith, allows, that, faith, and, its, expression, may, wax, and, wane, in, fervor, during, the, lifetime, of, a, faithful, individual, and, or, over, the, various, historical, centuries, of, a, society, with, an, embedded, religious, system, thus, one, can, speak, of, an, age, of, faith, or, of, the, decay, of, a, society, s, religiosity, into, corruption, secularism, or, atheism, interpretable, as, the, ultimate, loss, of, faith, in, contrast, to, richard, dawkins, view, of, faith, as, blind, trust, in, the, absence, of, evidence, even, in, the, teeth, of, evidence, alister, mcgrath, quotes, the, oxford, anglican, theologian, w, h, griffith, thomas, 1861, 1924, who, states, that, faith, is, not, blind, but, intelligent, and, that, it, commences, with, the, conviction, of, the, mind, based, on, adequate, evidence, which, mcgrath, sees, as, a, good, and, reliable, definition, synthesizing, the, core, elements, of, the, characteristic, christian, understanding, of, faith, american, biblical, scholar, archibald, thomas, robertson, 1863, 1934, stated, that, the, greek, word, pistis, used, for, faith, in, the, new, testament, over, two, hundred, forty, times, and, rendered, assurance, in, acts, 17, 31, is, an, old, verb, meaning, to, furnish, used, regularly, by, demosthenes, for, bringing, forward, evidence, tom, price, oxford, centre, for, christian, apologetics, affirms, that, when, the, new, testament, talks, about, faith, positively, it, only, uses, words, derived, from, the, greek, root, which, means, to, be, persuaded, british, christian, apologist, john, lennox, argues, that, faith, conceived, as, a, belief, that, lacks, warrant, is, very, different, from, faith, conceived, as, a, belief, that, has, warrant, he, states, that, the, use, of, the, adjective, blind, to, describe, faith, indicates, that, faith, is, not, necessarily, or, always, or, indeed, normally, blind, the, validity, or, warrant, of, faith, or, belief, depends, on, the, strength, of, the, evidence, on, which, the, belief, is, based, we, all, know, how, to, distinguish, between, blind, faith, and, evidence, based, faith, we, are, well, aware, that, faith, is, only, justified, if, there, is, evidence, to, back, it, up, evidence, based, faith, is, the, normal, concept, on, which, we, base, our, everyday, lives, peter, s, williams, holds, that, the, classic, christian, tradition, has, always, valued, rationality, and, does, not, hold, that, faith, involves, the, complete, abandonment, of, reason, while, believing, in, the, teeth, of, evidence, quoting, moreland, faith, is, defined, as, a, trust, in, and, commitment, to, what, we, have, reason, to, believe, is, true, regarding, doubting, thomas, in, john, 20, 24, 31, williams, points, out, that, thomas, wasn, t, asked, to, believe, without, evidence, he, was, asked, to, believe, based, on, the, other, disciples, testimony, thomas, initially, lacked, the, first, hand, experience, of, the, evidence, that, had, convinced, them, moreover, the, reason, john, gives, for, recounting, these, events, is, that, what, he, saw, is, evidence, jesus, did, many, other, miraculous, signs, in, the, presence, of, his, disciples, but, these, are, written, that, you, may, believe, that, jesus, is, the, christ, the, son, of, god, and, that, believing, ye, might, have, life, in, his, name, john, 20, 30, 31, concerning, doubting, thomas, michael, r, allen, wrote, thomas, s, definition, of, faith, implies, adherence, to, conceptual, propositions, for, the, sake, of, personal, knowledge, knowledge, of, and, about, a, person, qua, person, kenneth, boa, and, robert, m, bowman, jr, describe, a, classic, understanding, of, faith, that, is, referred, to, as, evidentialism, and, which, is, part, of, a, larger, epistemological, tradition, called, classical, foundationalism, which, is, accompanied, by, deontologism, which, holds, that, humans, must, regulate, their, beliefs, following, evidentialist, structures, they, show, how, this, can, go, too, far, and, alvin, plantinga, deals, with, it, while, plantinga, upholds, that, faith, may, be, the, result, of, evidence, testifying, to, the, reliability, of, the, source, of, the, truth, claims, yet, he, sees, having, faith, as, being, the, result, of, hearing, the, truth, of, the, gospel, with, the, internal, persuasion, by, the, holy, spirit, moving, and, enabling, him, to, believe, christian, belief, is, produced, in, the, believer, by, the, internal, instigation, of, the, holy, spirit, endorsing, the, teachings, of, scripture, which, is, itself, divinely, inspired, by, the, holy, spirit, the, result, of, the, work, of, the, holy, spirit, is, faith, the, four, part, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, ccc, gives, part, one, to, the, profession, of, faith, this, section, describes, the, content, of, faith, it, elaborates, and, expands, particularly, upon, the, apostles, creed, ccc, 144, initiates, a, section, on, the, obedience, of, faith, in, the, theology, of, pope, john, paul, ii, faith, is, understood, in, personal, terms, as, a, trusting, commitment, of, person, to, person, and, thus, involves, christian, commitment, to, the, divine, person, of, jesus, christ, in, methodism, faith, plays, an, important, role, in, justification, which, occurs, during, the, new, birth, the, emmanuel, association, a, methodist, denomination, in, the, conservative, holiness, movement, teaches, living, faith, is, the, gift, of, god, ephesians, 2, 8, romans, 4, 16, imparted, to, the, obedient, heart, through, the, word, of, god, romans, 10, 17, and, the, ministry, of, the, holy, ghost, ephesians, 2, 18, this, faith, becomes, effective, as, it, is, exercised, by, man, with, the, aid, of, the, spirit, which, aid, is, always, assured, when, the, heart, has, met, the, divine, condition, hebrews, 5, 9, living, faith, is, to, be, distinguished, from, intellectual, confidence, which, may, be, in, the, possession, of, any, unawakened, soul, romans, 10, 1, 4, the, articles, of, faith, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, states, that, faith, in, the, lord, jesus, christ, is, the, first, principle, of, the, gospel, some, alternative, yet, impactful, ideas, regarding, the, nature, of, faith, were, presented, by, church, founder, joseph, smith, in, a, collection, of, sermons, which, are, now, published, as, the, lectures, on, faith, faith, in, buddhism, saddh, raddh, refers, to, a, serene, commitment, to, the, practice, of, the, buddha, s, teaching, and, trust, in, enlightened, or, highly, developed, beings, such, as, buddhas, or, bodhisattvas, those, aiming, to, become, a, buddha, 388, 89, buddhists, usually, recognize, multiple, objects, of, faith, but, many, are, especially, devoted, to, one, particular, object, of, faith, such, as, one, particular, buddha, 386, 396, 7, in, early, buddhism, faith, was, focused, on, the, three, jewels, or, refuges, namely, gautama, buddha, his, teaching, the, dhamma, and, the, community, of, spiritually, developed, followers, or, the, monastic, community, seeking, enlightenment, the, sangha, although, offerings, to, the, monastic, community, were, valued, highest, early, buddhism, did, not, morally, condemn, peaceful, offerings, to, deities, 74, 5, 81, a, faithful, devotee, was, called, up, saka, or, up, sika, for, which, no, formal, declaration, was, required, in, early, buddhism, personal, verification, was, valued, highest, in, attaining, the, truth, and, sacred, scriptures, reason, or, faith, in, a, teacher, were, considered, less, valuable, sources, of, authority, as, important, as, faith, was, it, was, a, mere, initial, step, to, the, path, to, wisdom, and, enlightenment, and, was, obsolete, or, redefined, at, the, final, stage, of, that, path, 49, 50, 384, 396, 7, while, faith, in, buddhism, does, not, imply, blind, faith, buddhist, practice, nevertheless, requires, a, degree, of, trust, primarily, in, the, spiritual, attainment, of, gautama, buddha, faith, in, buddhism, can, still, be, described, as, faith, in, the, three, jewels, the, buddha, dharma, and, sangha, it, is, intended, to, lead, to, the, goal, of, enlightenment, or, bodhi, and, nirvana, volitionally, faith, implies, a, resolute, and, courageous, act, of, will, it, combines, the, steadfast, resolution, that, one, will, do, a, thing, with, the, self, confidence, that, one, can, do, it, in, the, later, stratum, of, buddhist, history, especially, mah, y, na, buddhism, faith, was, given, a, much, more, important, role, 172, the, concept, of, the, buddha, nature, was, developed, as, devotion, to, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, residing, in, pure, lands, became, commonplace, with, the, arising, of, the, cult, of, the, lotus, s, tra, faith, gained, a, central, role, in, buddhist, practice, which, was, further, amplified, with, the, development, of, devotion, to, the, amitabha, buddha, in, pure, land, buddhism, 123, in, the, japanese, form, of, pure, land, buddhism, under, the, teachers, h, nen, and, shinran, only, entrusting, faith, toward, the, amitabha, buddha, was, believed, to, be, a, fruitful, form, of, practice, as, the, practice, of, celibacy, morality, and, other, buddhist, disciplines, were, dismissed, as, no, longer, effective, in, this, day, and, age, or, as, contradicting, the, virtue, of, faith, 122, 3, harvey2013, faith, was, defined, as, a, state, similar, to, enlightenment, with, a, sense, of, self, negation, and, humility, thus, the, role, of, faith, increased, throughout, buddhist, history, however, from, the, nineteenth, century, onward, buddhist, modernism, in, countries, like, sri, lanka, and, japan, and, also, in, the, west, has, downplayed, and, criticized, the, role, of, faith, in, buddhism, faith, in, buddhism, still, has, a, role, in, modern, asia, and, the, west, but, is, understood, and, defined, differently, than, in, traditional, interpretations, 378, 429, 444, within, the, dalit, buddhist, movement, communities, taking, refuge, is, defined, not, only, as, a, religious, but, also, a, political, choice, bhakti, sanskrit, literally, means, attachment, participation, fondness, for, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship, purity, it, was, originally, used, in, hinduism, referring, to, devotion, and, love, for, a, personal, god, or, a, representational, god, by, a, devotee, in, ancient, texts, such, as, the, shvetashvatara, upanishad, the, term, simply, means, participation, devotion, and, love, for, any, endeavor, while, in, the, bhagavad, gita, it, connotes, one, of, the, possible, paths, of, spirituality, and, towards, moksha, as, in, bhakti, marga, ahimsa, also, referred, to, as, nonviolence, is, a, fundamental, tenet, of, hinduism, that, advocates, harmonious, and, peaceful, co, existence, and, evolutionary, growth, in, grace, and, wisdom, for, all, humankind, unconditionally, in, hinduism, most, of, the, vedic, prayers, begins, with, the, chants, of, om, om, is, the, sanskrit, symbol, that, amazingly, resonates, the, peacefulness, ensconced, within, one, s, higher, self, om, is, considered, to, have, a, profound, effect, on, the, body, and, mind, of, the, one, who, chants, and, also, creates, a, calmness, serenity, healing, strength, of, its, own, to, prevail, within, and, also, in, the, surrounding, environment, in, islam, a, believer, s, faith, in, the, metaphysical, aspects, of, islam, is, called, iman, arabic, which, is, complete, submission, to, the, will, of, god, not, unquestioning, or, blind, belief, a, man, must, build, his, faith, on, well, grounded, convictions, beyond, any, reasonable, doubt, and, above, uncertainty, according, to, the, quran, iman, must, be, accompanied, by, righteous, deeds, and, the, two, together, are, necessary, for, entry, into, paradise, in, the, hadith, of, gabriel, iman, in, addition, to, islam, and, ihsan, form, the, three, dimensions, of, the, islamic, religion, muhammad, referred, to, the, six, axioms, of, faith, in, the, hadith, of, gabriel, iman, is, that, you, believe, in, god, and, his, angels, and, his, books, and, his, messengers, and, the, hereafter, and, the, good, and, evil, fate, the, first, five, are, mentioned, together, in, the, qur, an, the, quran, states, that, faith, can, grow, with, remembrance, of, god, the, qur, an, also, states, that, nothing, in, this, world, should, be, dearer, to, a, true, believer, than, faith, judaism, recognizes, the, positive, value, of, emunah, generally, translated, as, faith, or, trust, in, god, and, the, negative, status, of, the, apikorus, heretic, but, faith, is, not, as, stressed, or, as, central, as, it, is, in, some, other, religions, especially, christianity, or, islam, faith, could, be, a, necessary, means, for, being, a, practicing, religious, jew, but, the, emphasis, is, placed, on, true, knowledge, true, prophecy, and, practice, rather, than, on, faith, itself, very, rarely, does, it, relate, to, any, teaching, that, must, be, believed, judaism, does, not, require, one, to, explicitly, identify, god, a, key, tenet, of, christian, faith, which, is, called, avodah, zarah, foreign, worship, in, judaism, a, minor, form, of, idol, worship, a, big, sin, and, strictly, forbidden, to, jews, rather, in, judaism, one, is, to, honor, a, personal, idea, of, god, supported, by, the, many, principles, quoted, in, the, talmud, to, define, judaism, mostly, by, what, it, is, not, thus, there, is, no, established, formulation, of, jewish, principles, of, faith, which, are, mandatory, for, all, observant, jews, in, the, jewish, scriptures, trust, in, god, emunah, refers, to, how, god, acts, toward, his, people, and, how, they, are, to, respond, to, him, it, is, rooted, in, the, everlasting, covenant, established, in, the, torah, notably, deuteronomy, 7, 9, know, therefore, that, the, lord, thy, god, he, is, god, the, faithful, god, who, keepeth, covenant, and, mercy, with, them, that, love, him, and, keep, his, commandments, to, a, thousand, generations, the, specific, tenets, that, compose, required, belief, and, their, application, to, the, times, have, been, disputed, throughout, jewish, history, today, many, but, not, all, orthodox, jews, have, accepted, maimonides, s, thirteen, principles, of, belief, a, traditional, example, of, emunah, as, seen, in, the, jewish, annals, is, found, in, the, person, of, abraham, on, several, occasions, abraham, both, accepts, statements, from, god, that, seem, impossible, and, offers, obedient, actions, in, response, to, direction, from, god, to, do, things, that, seem, implausible, the, talmud, describes, how, a, thief, also, believes, in, g, d, on, the, brink, of, his, forced, entry, as, he, is, about, to, risk, his, life, and, the, life, of, his, victim, he, cries, out, with, all, sincerity, g, d, help, me, the, thief, has, faith, that, there, is, a, g, d, who, hears, his, cries, yet, it, escapes, him, that, this, g, d, may, be, able, to, provide, for, him, without, requiring, that, he, abrogate, g, d, s, will, by, stealing, from, others, for, emunah, to, affect, him, in, this, way, he, needs, study, and, contemplation, faith, is, not, a, religious, concept, in, sikhism, however, the, five, sikh, symbols, known, as, kakaars, or, five, ks, in, punjabi, known, as, pa, j, kakk, or, pa, j, kak, r, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, five, articles, of, faith, the, articles, include, k, s, uncut, hair, ka, gh, small, wooden, comb, ka, circular, steel, or, iron, bracelet, kirp, n, sword, dagger, and, kacchera, special, undergarment, baptised, sikhs, are, bound, to, wear, those, five, articles, of, faith, at, all, times, to, save, them, from, bad, company, and, keep, them, close, to, god, in, the, bah, faith, faith, is, meant, first, as, conscious, knowledge, second, as, the, practice, of, good, deeds, and, ultimately, as, the, acceptance, of, the, divine, authority, of, the, manifestations, of, god, in, the, religion, s, view, faith, and, knowledge, are, both, required, for, spiritual, growth, faith, involves, more, than, outward, obedience, to, this, authority, but, also, must, be, based, on, a, deep, personal, understanding, of, religious, teachings, secular, faith, refers, to, a, belief, or, conviction, that, is, not, based, on, religious, or, supernatural, doctrines, secular, faith, can, arise, from, a, wide, range, of, sources, and, can, take, many, forms, depending, on, the, individual, s, beliefs, and, experiences, including, the, epistemological, study, focuses, on, epistemic, justification, the, rationality, of, belief, and, various, related, issues, a, justified, belief, is, a, belief, that, is, well, supported, by, evidence, and, reasons, and, that, is, arrived, at, through, a, reliable, and, trustworthy, process, of, inquiry, faith, is, often, regarded, as, a, form, of, belief, that, may, not, necessarily, rely, on, empirical, evidence, however, when, religious, faith, does, make, empirical, claims, these, claims, need, to, undergo, scientific, testing, to, determine, their, validity, on, the, other, hand, some, beliefs, may, not, make, empirical, claims, and, instead, focus, on, non, empirical, issues, such, as, ethics, morality, and, spiritual, practices, in, these, cases, it, may, be, necessary, to, evaluate, the, validity, of, these, beliefs, based, on, their, internal, coherence, and, logical, consistency, rather, than, empirical, testing, there, is, a, wide, spectrum, of, opinion, concerning, the, epistemological, validity, of, faith, that, is, whether, it, is, a, reliable, way, to, acquire, true, beliefs, fideism, is, considered, to, be, a, philosophical, position, rather, than, a, comprehensive, epistemological, theory, it, maintains, that, faith, is, independent, of, reason, or, that, reason, and, faith, are, hostile, to, each, other, and, faith, is, superior, at, arriving, at, particular, truths, see, natural, theology, fideism, is, not, a, synonym, for, religious, belief, but, describes, a, particular, philosophical, proposition, concerning, the, relationship, between, faith, s, appropriate, jurisdiction, at, arriving, at, truths, contrasted, against, reason, it, states, that, faith, is, needed, to, determine, some, philosophical, and, religious, truths, and, it, questions, the, ability, of, reason, to, arrive, at, all, truth, the, word, and, concept, had, its, origin, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, by, way, of, catholic, thought, in, a, movement, called, traditionalism, the, roman, catholic, magisterium, has, however, repeatedly, condemned, fideism, critics, of, fideism, suggest, that, it, is, not, a, justified, or, rational, position, from, an, epistemological, standpoint, fideism, holds, that, religious, beliefs, cannot, be, justified, or, evaluated, based, on, evidence, or, reason, and, that, faith, alone, is, a, sufficient, basis, for, belief, this, position, has, been, criticized, because, it, leads, to, dogmatism, irrationality, and, a, rejection, of, the, importance, of, reason, and, evidence, in, understanding, the, world, william, alston, argues, that, while, faith, is, an, important, aspect, of, religious, belief, it, must, be, grounded, in, reason, and, evidence, to, be, justified, religious, epistemologists, formulated, and, defended, reasons, for, the, rationality, of, accepting, belief, in, god, without, the, support, of, an, argument, some, religious, epistemologists, hold, that, belief, in, god, is, more, analogous, to, belief, in, a, person, than, belief, in, a, scientific, hypothesis, human, relations, demand, trust, and, commitment, if, belief, in, god, is, more, like, belief, in, other, persons, then, the, trust, that, is, appropriate, to, persons, will, be, appropriate, to, god, american, psychologist, and, philosopher, william, james, offers, a, similar, argument, in, his, lecture, the, will, to, believe, foundationalism, is, a, view, about, the, structure, of, justification, or, knowledge, foundationalism, holds, that, all, knowledge, and, justified, belief, are, ultimately, based, upon, what, are, called, properly, basic, beliefs, this, position, is, intended, to, resolve, the, infinite, regress, problem, in, epistemology, according, to, foundationalism, a, belief, is, epistemically, justified, only, if, it, is, justified, by, properly, basic, beliefs, one, of, the, significant, developments, in, foundationalism, is, the, rise, of, reformed, epistemology, reformed, epistemology, is, a, view, about, the, epistemology, of, religious, belief, which, holds, that, belief, in, god, can, be, properly, basic, analytic, philosophers, alvin, plantinga, and, nicholas, wolterstorff, develop, this, view, plantinga, holds, that, a, person, may, rationally, believe, in, god, even, though, the, person, does, not, possess, sufficient, evidence, to, convince, an, agnostic, one, difference, between, reformed, epistemology, and, fideism, is, that, the, former, requires, defense, against, known, objections, whereas, the, latter, might, dismiss, such, objections, as, irrelevant, plantinga, developed, reformed, epistemology, in, warranted, christian, belief, as, a, form, of, externalism, that, holds, that, the, justification, conferring, factors, for, a, belief, may, include, external, factors, some, theistic, philosophers, have, defended, theism, by, granting, evidentialism, but, supporting, theism, through, deductive, arguments, whose, premises, are, considered, justifiable, some, of, these, arguments, are, probabilistic, either, in, the, sense, of, having, weight, but, being, inconclusive, or, in, the, sense, of, having, a, mathematical, probability, assigned, to, them, notable, in, this, regard, are, the, cumulative, arguments, presented, by, british, philosopher, basil, mitchell, and, analytic, philosopher, richard, swinburne, whose, arguments, are, based, on, bayesian, probability, in, a, notable, exposition, of, his, arguments, swinburne, appeals, to, an, inference, for, the, best, explanation, professor, of, mathematics, and, philosopher, of, science, at, university, of, oxford, john, lennox, justifies, his, religious, belief, in, jesus, s, resurrection, and, miracles, by, believing, god, s, capability, of, breaking, the, commonly, recognized, law, of, nature, john, lennox, has, stated, faith, is, not, a, leap, in, the, dark, it, s, the, exact, opposite, it, s, a, commitment, based, on, evidence, it, is, irrational, to, reduce, all, faith, to, blind, faith, and, then, subject, it, to, ridicule, that, provides, a, very, anti, intellectual, and, convenient, way, of, avoiding, intelligent, discussion, he, criticises, richard, dawkins, as, a, famous, proponent, of, asserting, that, faith, equates, to, holding, a, belief, without, evidence, thus, that, it, is, possible, to, hold, belief, without, evidence, for, failing, to, provide, evidence, for, this, assertion, critics, of, reformed, epistemology, argue, that, it, fails, to, provide, a, compelling, justification, for, belief, in, god, and, that, it, is, unable, to, account, for, the, diversity, of, religious, belief, and, experience, they, also, argue, that, it, can, lead, to, a, kind, of, epistemic, relativism, in, which, all, religious, beliefs, are, considered, equally, valid, and, justified, regardless, of, their, content, or, coherence, despite, these, criticisms, reformed, epistemology, has, been, influential, in, the, contemporary, philosophy, of, religion, and, continues, to, be, an, active, area, of, debate, and, discussion, many, religious, beliefs, are, intended, to, be, metaphorical, or, symbolic, but, there, are, also, religious, beliefs, that, are, taken, quite, literally, by, believers, for, example, some, christians, believe, that, the, earth, was, created, in, six, literal, days, and, some, muslims, believe, that, the, quran, contains, scientific, facts, that, were, not, known, to, humans, at, the, time, of, its, revelation, furthermore, even, if, a, religious, belief, is, intended, to, be, metaphorical, or, symbolic, it, can, still, be, subject, to, empirical, testing, if, it, makes, claims, about, the, world, for, example, the, claim, that, the, earth, is, the, center, of, the, universe, can, be, interpreted, as, a, metaphorical, representation, of, humanity, s, special, place, in, the, cosmos, but, it, also, makes, an, empirical, claim, that, can, be, tested, by, scientific, observation, from, a, scientific, perspective, morality, is, not, dependent, on, faith, while, some, individuals, may, claim, that, their, morality, is, rooted, in, their, faith, or, religious, beliefs, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, morality, is, also, influenced, by, other, factors, such, as, social, and, cultural, norms, empathy, and, reason, studies, have, shown, that, individuals, from, diverse, cultural, and, religious, backgrounds, tend, to, share, many, moral, values, suggesting, that, morality, is, not, solely, dependent, on, faith, additionally, research, in, the, fields, of, psychology, neuroscience, and, evolutionary, biology, has, shed, light, on, the, biological, and, cognitive, mechanisms, underlying, moral, decision, making, providing, further, evidence, that, morality, is, not, exclusively, dependent, on, faith, bertrand, russell, wrote, christians, hold, that, their, faith, does, good, but, other, faiths, do, harm, at, any, rate, they, hold, this, about, the, communist, faith, what, i, wish, to, maintain, is, that, all, faiths, do, harm, we, may, define, faith, as, a, firm, belief, in, something, for, which, there, is, no, evidence, where, there, is, evidence, no, one, speaks, of, faith, we, do, not, speak, of, faith, that, two, and, two, are, four, or, that, the, earth, is, round, we, only, speak, of, faith, when, we, wish, to, substitute, emotion, for, evidence, the, substitution, of, emotion, for, evidence, is, apt, to, lead, to, strife, since, different, groups, substitute, different, emotions, christians, have, faith, in, the, resurrection, communists, have, faith, in, marx, s, theory, of, value, neither, faith, can, be, defended, rationally, and, each, therefore, is, defended, by, propaganda, and, if, necessary, by, war, evolutionary, biologist, richard, dawkins, criticizes, all, faith, by, generalizing, from, specific, faith, in, propositions, that, conflict, directly, with, scientific, evidence, he, describes, faith, as, belief, without, evidence, a, process, of, active, non, thinking, he, states, that, it, is, a, practice, that, only, degrades, our, understanding, of, the, natural, world, by, allowing, anyone, to, make, a, claim, about, nature, that, is, based, solely, on, their, personal, thoughts, and, possibly, distorted, perceptions, that, does, not, require, testing, against, nature, cannot, make, reliable, and, consistent, predictions, and, is, not, subject, to, peer, review, philosophy, professor, peter, boghossian, argues, that, reason, and, evidence, are, the, only, way, to, determine, which, claims, about, the, world, are, likely, true, different, religious, traditions, make, different, religious, claims, and, boghossian, asserts, that, faith, alone, cannot, resolve, conflicts, between, these, without, evidence, he, gives, an, example, of, the, belief, held, by, muslims, that, muhammad, who, died, in, the, year, 632, was, the, last, prophet, and, the, contradictory, belief, held, by, mormons, that, joseph, smith, born, in, 1805, was, a, prophet, boghossian, asserts, that, faith, has, no, built, in, corrective, mechanism, for, factual, claims, he, gives, the, example, of, the, belief, that, the, earth, is, 4, 000, years, old, with, only, faith, and, no, reason, or, evidence, he, argues, there, is, no, way, to, correct, this, claim, if, it, is, inaccurate, boghossian, advocates, thinking, of, faith, either, as, belief, without, evidence, or, pretending, to, know, things, you, don, t, know, friedrich, nietzsche, expressed, his, criticism, of, the, christian, idea, of, faith, in, passage, 51, of, the, antichrist, the, fact, that, faith, under, certain, circumstances, may, work, for, blessedness, but, that, this, blessedness, produced, by, an, id, e, fixe, by, no, means, makes, the, idea, itself, true, and, the, fact, that, faith, actually, moves, no, mountains, but, instead, raises, them, up, where, there, were, none, before, all, this, is, made, sufficiently, clear, by, a, walk, through, a, lunatic, asylum, not, of, course, to, a, priest, for, his, instincts, prompt, him, to, the, lie, that, sickness, is, not, sickness, and, lunatic, asylums, not, lunatic, asylums, christianity, finds, sickness, necessary, just, as, the, greek, spirit, had, need, of, a, superabundance, of, health, the, actual, ulterior, purpose, of, the, whole, system, of, salvation, of, the, church, is, to, make, people, ill, and, the, church, itself, doesn, t, it, set, up, a, catholic, lunatic, asylum, as, the, ultimate, ideal, the, whole, earth, as, a, madhouse, the, sort, of, religious, man, that, the, church, wants, is, a, typical, d, cadent, the, moment, at, which, a, religious, crisis, dominates, a, people, is, always, marked, by, epidemics, of, nervous, disorder, the, inner, world, of, the, religious, man, is, so, much, like, the, inner, world, of, the, overstrung, and, exhausted, that, it, is, difficult, to, distinguish, between, them, the, highest, states, of, mind, held, up, before, mankind, by, christianity, as, of, supreme, worth, are, actually, epileptoid, in, form, the, church, has, granted, the, name, of, holy, only, to, lunatics, or, to, gigantic, frauds, in, majorem, dei, honorem, gustave, le, bon, emphasizes, the, irrational, nature, of, faith, and, suggests, that, it, is, often, based, on, emotions, rather, than, reason, he, argues, that, faith, can, be, used, to, manipulate, and, control, people, particularly, in, the, context, of, religious, or, political, movements, in, this, sense, le, bon, views, faith, as, a, tool, that, can, be, wielded, by, those, in, power, to, shape, the, beliefs, and, behaviors, of, the,
