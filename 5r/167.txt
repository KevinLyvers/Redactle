monotheism, is, the, belief, that, one, god, is, the, only, deity, a, distinction, may, be, made, between, exclusive, monotheism, in, which, the, one, god, is, a, singular, existence, and, both, inclusive, and, pluriform, monotheism, in, which, multiple, gods, or, godly, forms, are, recognized, but, each, are, postulated, as, extensions, of, the, same, god, monotheism, is, distinguished, from, henotheism, a, religious, system, in, which, the, believer, worships, one, god, without, denying, that, others, may, worship, different, gods, with, equal, validity, and, monolatrism, the, recognition, of, the, existence, of, many, gods, but, with, the, consistent, worship, of, only, one, deity, the, term, monolatry, was, perhaps, first, used, by, julius, wellhausen, monotheism, characterizes, the, traditions, of, zoroastrianism, b, bism, the, bah, faith, christianity, deism, druzism, eckankar, sikhism, manichaeism, islam, judaism, samaritanism, mandaeism, rastafari, seicho, no, ie, tenrikyo, yazidism, and, atenism, elements, of, monotheistic, thought, are, found, in, early, religions, such, as, ancient, chinese, religion, tengrism, and, yahwism, the, word, monotheism, was, coined, from, the, greek, monos, meaning, single, and, theos, meaning, god, the, term, was, coined, by, henry, more, 1614, 1687, monotheism, is, a, complex, and, nuanced, concept, the, biblical, authors, had, various, ways, of, understanding, god, and, the, divine, shaped, by, their, historical, and, cultural, contexts, the, notion, of, monotheism, that, is, used, today, was, developed, much, later, influenced, by, the, enlightenment, and, christian, views, many, definitions, of, monotheism, are, too, modern, western, and, christian, centered, to, account, for, the, diversity, and, complexity, of, the, ancient, sources, which, include, not, only, the, biblical, texts, but, also, other, writings, inscriptions, and, material, remains, that, help, reconstruct, the, ancient, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, people, of, judah, and, israel, the, term, monotheism, is, often, contrasted, with, polytheism, but, many, scholars, prefer, other, terms, such, as, monolatry, henotheism, or, one, god, discourse, quasi, monotheistic, claims, of, the, existence, of, a, universal, deity, date, to, the, late, bronze, age, with, akhenaten, s, great, hymn, to, the, aten, from, the, 14th, century, bce, in, the, iron, age, south, asian, vedic, period, a, possible, inclination, towards, monotheism, emerged, the, rigveda, exhibits, notions, of, monism, of, the, brahman, particularly, in, the, comparatively, late, tenth, book, which, is, dated, to, the, early, iron, age, e, g, in, the, nasadiya, sukta, later, ancient, hindu, theology, was, monist, but, was, not, strictly, monotheistic, in, worship, because, it, still, maintained, the, existence, of, many, gods, who, were, envisioned, as, aspects, of, one, supreme, god, brahman, in, china, the, orthodox, faith, system, held, by, most, dynasties, since, at, least, the, shang, dynasty, 1766, bce, until, the, modern, period, centered, on, the, worship, of, shangdi, literally, above, sovereign, generally, translated, as, god, or, heaven, as, an, omnipotent, force, however, this, faith, system, was, not, truly, monotheistic, since, other, lesser, gods, and, spirits, which, varied, with, locality, were, also, worshipped, along, with, shangdi, still, later, variants, such, as, mohism, 470, bce, c, 391, bce, approached, true, monotheism, teaching, that, the, function, of, lesser, gods, and, ancestral, spirits, is, merely, to, carry, out, the, will, of, shangdi, akin, to, the, angels, in, abrahamic, religions, which, in, turn, counts, as, only, one, god, since, the, sixth, century, bce, zoroastrians, have, believed, in, the, supremacy, of, one, god, above, all, ahura, mazda, as, the, maker, of, all, and, the, first, being, before, all, others, the, prophet, zoroaster, is, credited, with, the, founding, of, the, first, monotheistic, religion, in, history, sometime, around, the, middle, of, the, second, millennium, bce, antedating, the, israelites, and, leaving, a, lasting, imprint, on, second, temple, judaism, and, through, it, on, later, monotheistic, religions, post, exilic, judaism, after, the, late, 6th, century, bce, was, the, first, religion, to, conceive, the, notion, of, a, personal, monotheistic, god, within, a, monist, context, the, concept, of, ethical, monotheism, which, holds, that, morality, stems, from, god, alone, and, that, its, laws, are, unchanging, first, occurred, in, judaism, but, is, now, a, core, tenet, of, most, modern, monotheistic, religions, including, christianity, islam, sikhism, and, bah, faith, also, from, the, 6th, century, bce, thales, followed, by, other, monists, such, as, anaximander, anaximenes, heraclitus, parmenides, proposed, that, nature, can, be, explained, by, reference, to, a, single, unitary, principle, that, pervades, everything, numerous, ancient, greek, philosophers, including, xenophanes, of, colophon, and, antisthenes, believed, in, a, similar, polytheistic, monism, that, bore, some, similarities, to, monotheism, the, first, known, reference, to, a, unitary, god, is, plato, s, demiurge, divine, craftsman, followed, by, aristotle, s, unmoved, mover, both, of, which, would, profoundly, influence, jewish, and, christian, theology, according, to, jewish, christian, and, islamic, tradition, monotheism, was, the, original, religion, of, humanity, this, original, religion, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, adamic, religion, or, in, the, terms, of, andrew, lang, the, urreligion, scholars, of, religion, largely, abandoned, that, view, in, the, 19th, century, in, favour, of, an, evolutionary, progression, from, animism, via, polytheism, to, monotheism, but, by, 1974, this, theory, was, less, widely, held, and, a, modified, view, similar, to, lang, s, became, more, prominent, austrian, anthropologist, wilhelm, schmidt, had, postulated, an, urmonotheismus, original, or, primitive, monotheism, in, the, 1910s, it, was, objected, that, judaism, christianity, and, islam, had, grown, up, in, opposition, to, polytheism, as, had, greek, philosophical, monotheism, more, recently, karen, armstrong, and, other, authors, have, returned, to, the, idea, of, an, evolutionary, progression, beginning, with, animism, which, developed, into, polytheism, which, developed, into, henotheism, which, developed, into, monolatry, which, developed, into, true, monotheism, the, tikar, people, of, cameroon, have, a, traditional, spirituality, that, emphasizes, the, worship, of, a, single, god, nyuy, the, himba, people, of, namibia, practice, a, form, of, monotheistic, panentheism, and, worship, the, god, mukuru, the, deceased, ancestors, of, the, himba, and, herero, are, subservient, to, him, acting, as, intermediaries, the, igbo, people, practice, a, form, of, monotheism, called, odinani, odinani, has, monotheistic, and, panentheistic, attributes, having, a, single, god, as, the, source, of, all, things, although, a, pantheon, of, spirits, exists, these, are, lesser, spirits, prevalent, in, odinani, expressly, serving, as, elements, of, chineke, or, chukwu, the, supreme, being, or, high, god, waaq, is, the, name, of, a, singular, god, in, the, traditional, religion, of, many, cushitic, people, in, the, horn, of, africa, denoting, an, early, monotheistic, religion, however, this, religion, was, mostly, replaced, with, the, abrahamic, religions, some, approximately, 3, of, oromo, still, follow, this, traditional, monotheistic, religion, called, waaqeffanna, in, oromo, amenhotep, iv, initially, introduced, atenism, in, year, 5, of, his, reign, 1348, 1346, bce, during, the, 18th, dynasty, of, the, new, kingdom, he, raised, aten, once, a, relatively, obscure, egyptian, solar, deity, representing, the, disk, of, the, sun, to, the, status, of, supreme, god, in, the, egyptian, pantheon, to, emphasise, the, change, aten, s, name, was, written, in, the, cartouche, form, normally, reserved, for, pharaohs, an, innovation, of, atenism, this, religious, reformation, appears, to, coincide, with, the, proclamation, of, a, sed, festival, a, sort, of, royal, jubilee, intended, to, reinforce, the, pharaoh, s, divine, powers, of, kingship, traditionally, held, in, the, thirtieth, year, of, the, pharaoh, s, reign, this, possibly, was, a, festival, in, honour, of, amenhotep, iii, who, some, egyptologists, think, had, a, coregency, with, his, son, amenhotep, iv, of, two, to, twelve, years, year, 5, is, believed, to, mark, the, beginning, of, amenhotep, iv, s, construction, of, a, new, capital, akhetaten, horizon, of, the, aten, at, the, site, known, today, as, amarna, evidence, of, this, appears, on, three, of, the, boundary, stelae, used, to, mark, the, boundaries, of, this, new, capital, at, this, time, amenhotep, iv, officially, changed, his, name, to, akhenaten, agreeable, to, aten, as, evidence, of, his, new, worship, the, date, given, for, the, event, has, been, estimated, to, fall, around, january, 2, of, that, year, in, year, 7, of, his, reign, 1346, 1344, bce, the, capital, was, moved, from, thebes, to, akhetaten, near, modern, amarna, though, construction, of, the, city, seems, to, have, continued, for, two, more, years, in, shifting, his, court, from, the, traditional, ceremonial, centres, akhenaten, was, signalling, a, dramatic, transformation, in, the, focus, of, religious, and, political, power, the, move, separated, the, pharaoh, and, his, court, from, the, influence, of, the, priesthood, and, from, the, traditional, centres, of, worship, but, his, decree, had, deeper, religious, significance, too, taken, in, conjunction, with, his, name, change, it, is, possible, that, the, move, to, amarna, was, also, meant, as, a, signal, of, akhenaten, s, symbolic, death, and, rebirth, it, may, also, have, coincided, with, the, death, of, his, father, and, the, end, of, the, coregency, in, addition, to, constructing, a, new, capital, in, honor, of, aten, akhenaten, also, oversaw, the, construction, of, some, of, the, most, massive, temple, complexes, in, ancient, egypt, including, one, at, karnak, and, one, at, thebes, close, to, the, old, temple, of, amun, in, year, 9, 1344, 1342, bce, akhenaten, declared, a, more, radical, version, of, his, new, religion, declaring, aten, not, merely, the, supreme, god, of, the, egyptian, pantheon, but, the, only, god, of, egypt, with, himself, as, the, sole, intermediary, between, the, aten, and, the, egyptian, people, key, features, of, atenism, included, a, ban, on, idols, and, other, images, of, the, aten, with, the, exception, of, a, rayed, solar, disc, in, which, the, rays, commonly, depicted, ending, in, hands, appear, to, represent, the, unseen, spirit, of, aten, akhenaten, made, it, however, clear, that, the, image, of, the, aten, only, represented, the, god, but, that, the, god, transcended, creation, and, so, could, not, be, fully, understood, or, represented, aten, was, addressed, by, akhenaten, in, prayers, such, as, the, great, hymn, to, the, aten, o, sole, god, beside, whom, there, is, none, the, details, of, atenist, theology, are, still, unclear, the, exclusion, of, all, but, one, god, and, the, prohibition, of, idols, was, a, radical, departure, from, egyptian, tradition, but, scholars, see, akhenaten, as, a, practitioner, of, monolatry, rather, than, monotheism, as, he, did, not, actively, deny, the, existence, of, other, gods, he, simply, refrained, from, worshiping, any, but, aten, akhenaten, associated, aten, with, ra, and, put, forward, the, eminence, of, aten, as, the, renewal, of, the, kingship, of, ra, under, akhenaten, s, successors, egypt, reverted, to, its, traditional, religion, and, akhenaten, himself, came, to, be, reviled, as, a, heretic, some, egyptian, ethical, text, authors, believed, in, only, a, single, god, ruling, over, the, universe, native, american, religions, may, be, monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or, some, combination, thereof, cherokee, religion, for, example, is, monotheist, as, well, as, pantheist, the, great, spirit, called, wakan, tanka, among, the, sioux, and, gitche, manitou, in, algonquian, is, a, conception, of, universal, spiritual, force, or, supreme, being, prevalent, among, some, native, american, and, first, nation, cultures, according, to, lakota, activist, russell, means, a, better, translation, of, wakan, tanka, is, the, great, mystery, indeed, wanka, tanka, among, the, lakota, was, considered, a, council, of, gods, in, pre, columbian, times, and, their, religion, is, not, monotheistic, some, researchers, have, interpreted, aztec, philosophy, as, fundamentally, monotheistic, or, panentheistic, while, the, populace, at, large, believed, in, a, polytheistic, pantheon, aztec, priests, and, nobles, might, have, come, to, an, interpretation, of, teotl, as, a, single, universal, force, with, many, facets, there, has, been, criticism, to, this, idea, however, most, notably, that, many, assertions, of, this, supposed, monotheism, might, actually, come, from, post, conquistador, bias, imposing, an, antiquity, pagan, model, onto, the, aztec, the, orthodox, faith, system, held, by, most, dynasties, of, china, since, at, least, the, shang, dynasty, 1766, bce, until, the, modern, period, centered, on, the, worship, of, shangdi, literally, above, sovereign, generally, translated, as, high, god, or, heaven, as, a, supreme, being, standing, above, other, gods, this, faith, system, pre, dated, the, development, of, confucianism, and, taoism, and, the, introduction, of, buddhism, and, christianity, it, has, some, features, of, monotheism, in, that, heaven, is, seen, as, an, omnipotent, entity, a, noncorporeal, force, with, a, personality, transcending, the, world, however, this, faith, system, was, not, truly, monotheistic, since, other, lesser, gods, and, spirits, which, varied, with, locality, were, also, worshiped, along, with, shangdi, still, later, variants, such, as, mohism, 470, bce, c, 391, bce, approached, true, monotheism, teaching, that, the, function, of, lesser, gods, and, ancestral, spirits, is, merely, to, carry, out, the, will, of, shangdi, in, mozi, s, will, of, heaven, he, writes, i, know, heaven, loves, men, dearly, not, without, reason, heaven, ordered, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, stars, to, enlighten,

cultivating, the, five, grains, and, flax, and, silk, to, provide, for, the, people, s, food, and, clothing, this, has, been, so, from, antiquity, to, the, present, worship, of, shangdi, and, heaven, in, ancient, china, includes, the, erection, of, shrines, the, last, and, greatest, being, the, temple, of, heaven, in, beijing, and, the, offering, of, prayers, the, ruler, of, china, in, every, chinese, dynasty, would, perform, annual, sacrificial, rituals, to, shangdi, usually, by, slaughtering, a, completely, healthy, bull, as, sacrifice, although, its, popularity, gradually, diminished, after, the, advent, of, taoism, and, buddhism, among, other, religions, its, concepts, remained, in, use, throughout, the, pre, modern, period, and, have, been, incorporated, in, later, religions, in, china, including, terminology, used, by, early, christians, in, china, despite, the, rising, of, non, theistic, and, pantheistic, spirituality, contributed, by, taoism, and, buddhism, shangdi, was, still, praised, up, until, the, end, of, the, qing, dynasty, as, the, last, ruler, of, the, qing, declared, himself, son, of, heaven, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, guangdong, region, monotheist, influences, led, to, the, taiping, rebellion, tengrism, or, tangrism, sometimes, stylized, as, tengriism, occasionally, referred, to, as, tengrianism, is, a, modern, term, for, a, central, asian, religion, characterized, by, features, of, shamanism, animism, totemism, both, polytheism, and, monotheism, and, ancestor, worship, historically, it, was, the, prevailing, religion, of, the, bulgars, turks, mongols, and, hungarians, as, well, as, the, xiongnu, and, the, huns, it, was, the, state, religion, of, the, six, ancient, turkic, states, avar, khaganate, old, great, bulgaria, first,

among, turkic, peoples, as, a, national, religion, in, chinese, and, turco, mongol, traditions, the, supreme, god, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, ruler, of, heaven, or, the, sky, lord, granted, with, omnipotent, powers, but, it, has, largely, diminished, in, those, regions, due, to, ancestor, worship, taoism, s, pantheistic, views, and, buddhism, s, rejection, of, a, creator, god, on, some, occasions, in, the, mythology, the, sky, lord, as, identified, as, a, male, has, been, associated, to, mate, with, an, earth, mother, while, some, traditions, kept, the, omnipotence, of, the, sky, lord, unshared, the, head, deity, of, the, proto, indo, european, religion, was, the, god, dy, us, p, a, t, r, a, number, of, words, derived, from, the, name, of, this, prominent, deity, are, used, in, various, indo, european, languages, to, denote, a, monotheistic, god, nonetheless, in, spite, of, this, proto, indo, european, religion, itself, was, not, monotheistic, in, eastern, europe, the, ancient, traditions, of, the, slavic, religion, contained, elements, of, monotheism, in, the, sixth, century, ad, the, byzantine, chronicler, procopius, recorded, that, the, slavs, acknowledge, that, one, god, creator, of, lightning, is, the, only, lord, of, all, to, him, do, they, sacrifice, an, ox, and, all, sacrificial, animals, the, deity, to, whom, procopius, is, referring, is, the, storm, god, per, n, whose, name, is, derived, from, perk, w, unos, the, proto, indo, european, god, of, lightning, the, ancient, slavs, syncretized, him, with, the, germanic, god, thor, and, the, biblical, prophet, elijah, the, surviving, fragments, of, the, poems, of, the, classical, greek, philosopher, xenophanes, of, colophon, suggest, that, he, held, views, very, similar, to, those, of, modern, monotheists, his, poems, harshly, criticize, the, traditional, notion, of, anthropomorphic, gods, commenting, that, if, cattle, and, horses, and, lions, had, hands, or, could, paint, with, their, hands, and, create, works, such, as, men, do, also, would, depict, the, gods, shapes, and, make, their, bodies, of, such, a, sort, as, the, form, they, themselves, have, instead, xenophanes, declares, that, there, is, one, god, greatest, among, gods, and, humans, like, mortals, neither, in, form, nor, in, thought, xenophanes, s, theology, appears, to, have, been, monist, but, not, truly, monotheistic, in, the, strictest, sense, although, some, later, philosophers, such, as, antisthenes, believed, in, doctrines, similar, to, those, expounded, by, xenophanes, his, ideas, do, not, appear, to, have, become, widely, popular, although, plato, himself, was, a, polytheist, in, his, writings, he, often, presents, socrates, as, speaking, of, the, god, in, the, singular, form, he, does, however, often, speak, of, the, gods, in, the, plural, form, as, well, the, euthyphro, dilemma, for, example, is, formulated, as, is, that, which, is, holy, loved, by, the, gods, because, it, is, holy, or, is, it, holy, because, it, is, loved, by, the, gods, the, development, of, pure, philosophical, monotheism, is, a, product, of, the, late, antiquity, during, the, 2nd, to, 3rd, centuries, early, christianity, was, just, one, of, several, competing, religious, movements, advocating, monotheism, the, one, is, a, concept, that, is, prominent, in, the, writings, of, the, neoplatonists, especially, those, of, the, philosopher, plotinus, in, the, writings, of, plotinus, the, one, is, described, as, an, inconceivable, transcendent, all, embodying, permanent, eternal, causative, entity, that, permeates, throughout, all, of, existence, a, number, of, oracles, of, apollo, from, didyma, and, clarus, the, so, called, theological, oracles, dated, to, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, century, ce, proclaim, that, there, is, only, one, highest, god, of, whom, the, gods, of, polytheistic, religions, are, mere, manifestations, or, servants, 4th, century, ce, cyprus, had, besides, christianity, an, apparently, monotheistic, cult, of, dionysus, the, hypsistarians, were, a, religious, group, who, believed, in, a, most, high, god, according, to, greek, documents, later, revisions, of, this, hellenic, religion, were, adjusted, towards, monotheism, as, it, gained, consideration, among, a, wider, populace, the, worship, of, zeus, as, the, head, god, signaled, a, trend, in, the, direction, of, monotheism, with, less, honour, paid, to, the, fragmented, powers, of, the, lesser, gods, judaism, is, traditionally, considered, one, of, the, oldest, monotheistic, religions, in, the, world, although, up, to, the, 8th, century, bce, the, israelites, were, polytheistic, with, their, worship, including, the, gods, el, baal, asherah, and, astarte, yahweh, was, originally, the, national, god, of, the, kingdom, of, israel, and, the, kingdom, of, judah, during, the, 8th, century, bce, the, worship, of, yahweh, in, israel, was, in, competition, with, many, other, cults, described, by, the, yahwist, faction, collectively, as, baals, the, oldest, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, reflect, this, competition, as, in, the, books, of, hosea, and, nahum, whose, authors, lament, the, apostasy, of, the, people, of, israel, threatening, them, with, the, wrath, of, god, if, they, do, not, give, up, their, polytheistic, cults, as, time, progressed, the, henotheistic, cult, of, yahweh, grew, increasingly, militant, in, its, opposition, to, the, worship, of, other, gods, some, scholars, date, the, start, of, widespread, monotheism, to, the, late, 8th, century, bce, and, view, it, as, a, response, to, neo, assyrian, aggression, later, the, reforms, of, king, josiah, imposed, a, form, of, strict, monolatrism, after, the, fall, of, judah, and, the, beginning, of, the, babylonian, captivity, a, small, circle, of, priests, and, scribes, gathered, around, the, exiled, royal, court, where, they, first, developed, the, concept, of, yahweh, as, the, sole, god, of, the, world, second, temple, judaism, and, later, rabbinic, judaism, became, strictly, monotheistic, the, babylonian, talmud, references, other, foreign, gods, as, non, existent, entities, to, whom, humans, mistakenly, ascribe, reality, and, power, one, of, the, best, known, statements, of, rabbinic, judaism, on, monotheism, is, the, second, of, maimonides, 13, principles, of, faith, god, the, cause, of, all, is, one, this, does, not, mean, one, as, in, one, of, a, pair, nor, one, like, a, species, which, encompasses, many, individuals, nor, one, as, in, an, object, that, is, made, up, of, many, elements, nor, as, a, single, simple, object, that, is, infinitely, divisible, rather, god, is, a, unity, unlike, any, other, possible, unity, some, in, judaism, and, islam, reject, the, christian, idea, of, monotheism, modern, judaism, uses, the, term, shituf, to, refer, to, the, worship, of, god, in, a, manner, which, judaism, deems, to, be, neither, purely, monotheistic, though, still, permissible, for, non, jews, nor, polytheistic, which, would, be, prohibited, among, early, christians, there, was, considerable, debate, over, the, nature, of, the, godhead, with, some, denying, the, incarnation, but, not, the, deity, of, jesus, docetism, and, others, later, calling, for, an, arian, conception, of, god, despite, at, least, one, earlier, local, synod, rejecting, the, claim, of, arius, this, christological, issue, was, to, be, one, of, the, items, addressed, at, the, first, council, of, nicaea, the, first, council, of, nicaea, held, in, nicaea, in, present, day, turkey, convoked, by, the, roman, emperor, constantine, i, in, 325, was, the, first, ecumenical, council, of, bishops, of, the, roman, empire, and, most, significantly, resulted, in, the, first, uniform, christian, doctrine, called, the, nicene, creed, with, the, creation, of, the, creed, a, precedent, was, established, for, subsequent, general, ecumenical, councils, of, bishops, synods, to, create, statements, of, belief, and, canons, of, doctrinal, orthodoxy, the, intent, being, to, define, a, common, creed, for, the, church, and, address, heretical, ideas, one, purpose, of, the, council, was, to, resolve, disagreements, in, alexandria, over, the, nature, of, jesus, in, relationship, to, the, father, in, particular, whether, jesus, was, of, the, same, substance, as, god, the, father, or, merely, of, similar, substance, all, but, two, bishops, took, the, first, position, while, arius, argument, failed, christian, orthodox, traditions, eastern, orthodox, oriental, orthodox, roman, catholic, and, most, protestants, follow, this, decision, which, was, reaffirmed, in, 381, at, the, first, council, of, constantinople, and, reached, its, full, development, through, the, work, of, the, cappadocian, fathers, they, consider, god, to, be, a, triune, entity, called, the, trinity, comprising, three, persons, god, the, father, god, the, son, and, god, the, holy, spirit, these, three, are, described, as, being, of, the, same, substance, christians, overwhelmingly, assert, that, monotheism, is, central, to, the, christian, faith, as, the, nicene, creed, and, others, which, gives, the, orthodox, christian, definition, of, the, trinity, begins, i, believe, in, one, god, from, earlier, than, the, times, of, the, nicene, creed, 325, ce, various, christian, figures, advocated, the, triune, mystery, nature, of, god, as, a, normative, profession, of, faith, according, to, roger, e, olson, and, christopher, hall, through, prayer, meditation, study, and, practice, the, christian, community, concluded, that, god, must, exist, as, both, a, unity, and, trinity, codifying, this, in, ecumenical, council, at, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, most, modern, christians, believe, the, godhead, is, triune, meaning, that, the, three, persons, of, the, trinity, are, in, one, union, in, which, each, person, is, also, wholly, god, they, also, hold, to, the, doctrine, of, a, man, god, christ, jesus, as, god, incarnate, these, christians, also, do, not, believe, that, one, of, the, three, divine, figures, is, god, alone, and, the, other, two, are, not, but, that, all, three, are, mysteriously, god, and, one, other, christian, religions, including, unitarian, universalism, jehovah, s, witnesses, mormonism, and, others, do, not, share, those, views, on, the, trinity, some, christian, faiths, such, as, mormonism, argue, that, the, godhead, is, in, fact, three, separate, individuals, which, include, god, the, father, his, son, jesus, christ, and, the, holy, ghost, each, individual, having, a, distinct, purpose, in, the, grand, existence, of, human, kind, furthermore, mormons, believe, that, before, the, council, of, nicaea, the, predominant, belief, among, many, early, christians, was, that, the, godhead, was, three, separate, individuals, in, support, of, this, view, they, cite, early, christian, examples, of, belief, in, subordinationism, unitarianism, is, a, theological, movement, named, for, its, understanding, of, god, as, one, person, in, direct, contrast, to, trinitarianism, some, in, judaism, and, some, in, islam, do, not, consider, trinitarian, christianity, to, be, a, pure, form, of, monotheism, due, to, the, pluriform, monotheistic, christian, doctrine, of, the, trinity, classifying, it, as, shituf, in, judaism, and, as, shirk, in, islam, trinitarian, christians, on, the, other, hand, argue, that, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, is, a, valid, expression, of, monotheism, citing, that, the, trinity, does, not, consist, of, three, separate, deities, but, rather, the, three, persons, who, exist, consubstantially, as, one, substance, within, a, single, godhead, in, islam, god, all, h, is, all, powerful, and, all, knowing, the, creator, sustainer, ordainer, and, judge, of, the, universe, god, in, islam, is, strictly, singular, tawhid, unique, wahid, and, inherently, one, ahad, all, merciful, and,

judaism, with, some, thematic, elements, similar, to, gnosticism, islamic, belief, states, that, muhammad, did, not, bring, a, new, religion, from, god, but, rather, the, same, religion, as, practiced, by, abraham, moses, david, jesus, and, all, the, other, prophets, of, god, the, assertion, of, islam, is, that, the, message, of, god, had, been, corrupted, distorted, or, lost, over, time, and, the, quran, was, sent, to, muhammad, in, order, to, correct, the, lost, message, of, the, tawrat, torah, injil, gospel, and, zabur, the, quran, asserts, the, existence, of, a, single, and, absolute, truth, that, transcends, the, world, a, unique, and, indivisible, being, who, is, independent, of, the, creation, the, quran, rejects, binary, modes, of, thinking, such, as, the, idea, of, a, duality, of, god, by, arguing, that, both, good, and, evil, generate, from, god, s, creative, act, god, is, a, universal, god, rather, than, a, local, tribal, or, parochial, one, an, absolute, who, integrates, all, affirmative, values, and, brooks, no, evil, ash, ari, theology, which, dominated, sunni, islam, from, the, tenth, to, the, nineteenth, century, insists, on, ultimate, divine,

sometimes, termed, rastafarianism, is, classified, as, both, a, new, religious, movement, and, social, movement, it, developed, in, jamaica, during, the, 1930s, it, lacks, any, centralised, authority, and, there, is, much, heterogeneity, among, practitioners, who, are, known, as, rastafari, rastafarians, or, rastas, rastafari, refer, to, their, beliefs, which, are, based, on, a, specific, interpretation, of, the, bible, as, rastalogy, central, is, a, monotheistic, belief, in, a, single, god, referred, to, as, jah, who, partially, resides, within, each, individual, the, former, emperor, of, ethiopia, haile, selassie, is, given, central, importance, many, rastas, regard, him, as, an, incarnation, of, jah, on, earth, and, as, the, second, coming, of, christ, others, regard, him, as, a, human, prophet, who, fully, recognised, the, inner, divinity, within, every, individual, by, some, scholars, the, zoroastrians, parsis, or, zartoshtis, are, sometimes, credited, with, being, some, of, the, first, monotheists, and, having, had, influence, on, other, world, religions, zoroastrianism, combines, cosmogonic, dualism, and, eschatological, monotheism, which, makes, it, unique, among, the, religions, of, the, world, there, are, two, issues, that, have, long, made, it, problematic, to, identify, zoroastrianism, as, true, monotheism, the, presence, of, lesser, deities, and, dualism, but, before, hastening, to, conclude, that, the, amesha, spentas, and, the, other, yazatas, compromise, the, purity, of, monotheism, we, should, consider, that, the, other, historical, monotheisms, too, made, room, for, other, figures, endowed, with, supernatural, powers, to, bridge, the, gulf, between, the, exalted, remote, creator, god, and, the, human, world, the, angels, in, all, of, them, whose, conception, in, post, exilic, judaism, was, apparently, developed, after, the, pattern, of, the, amesha, spentas, boyce, and, grenet, 1991, 404, 405, the, saints, and, the, virgin, mary, in, several, christian, churches, and, the, other, persons, of, the, trinity, in, all, of, christianity, despite, the, vast, differences, with, zoroastrian, theology, the, common, thread, is, that, all, these, beings, are, subordinate, to, the, godhead, as, helpers, or, in, the, case, of, the, persons, of, the, trinity, co, equals, hence, they, do, not, pursue, different, interests, and, are, worshiped, jointly, with, the, godhead, not, separately, therefore, the, supplicant, s, dilemma, does, not, arise, god, in, yazidism, created, the, world, and, entrusted, it, into, the, care, of, seven, holy, beings, known, as, angels, the, yazidis, believe, in, a, divine, triad, the, original, hidden, god, of, the, yazidis, is, considered, to, be, remote, and, inactive, in, relation, to, his, creation, except, to, contain, and, bind, it, together, within, his, essence, his, first, emanation, is, the, angel, melek, ta, s, taw, s, melek, who, functions, as, the, ruler, of, the, world, and, leader, of, the, other, angels, the, second, hypostasis, of, the, divine, triad, is, the, sheikh, ad, ibn, musafir, the, third, is, sultan, ezid, these, are, the, three, hypostases, of, the, one, god, the, identity, of, these, three, is, sometimes, blurred, with, sheikh, ad, considered, to, be, a, manifestation, of, taw, s, melek, and, vice, versa, the, same, also, applies, to, sultan, ezid, yazidis, are, called, milet, taw, s, melek, the, nation, of, taw, s, melek, god, is, referred, to, by, yazidis, as, xwed, xwedawend, zdan, and, pedsha, king, and, less, commonly, ellah, and, heq, according, to, some, yazidi, hymns, known, as, qewls, god, has, 1, 001, names, or, 3, 003, names, according, to, other, qewls, aboriginal, australians, are, typically, described, as, polytheistic, in, nature,

cultures, the, sky, father, baiame, is, perceived, as, the, creator, of, the, universe, though, this, role, is, sometimes, taken, by, other, gods, like, yhi, or, bunjil, and, at, least, among, the,

narayana, as, such, he, is, therefore, regarded, as, svayam, bhagavan, when, krishna, is, recognized, to, be, svayam, bhagavan, it, can, be, understood, that, this, is, the, belief, of, gaudiya, vaishnavism, the, vallabha, sampradaya, and, the, nimbarka, sampradaya, where, krishna, is, accepted, to, be, the, source, of, all, other, avatars, and, the, source, of, vishnu, himself, this, belief, is, drawn, primarily, from, the, famous, statement, of, the, bhagavatam, 1, 3, 28, a, viewpoint, differing, from, this, theological, concept, is, the, concept, of, krishna, as, an, avatar, of, narayana, or, vishnu, it, should, be, however, noted, that, although, it, is, usual, to, speak, of, vishnu, as, the, source, of, the, avataras, this, is, only, one, of, the, names, of, the, god, of, vaishnavism, who, is, also, known, as, narayana, vasudeva, and, krishna, and, behind, each, of, those, names, there, is, a, divine, figure, with, attributed, supremacy, in, vaishnavism, the, rig,

a, monotheistic, view, the, naiyanikas, have, given, an, argument, that, such, a, god, can, only, be, one, in, the, nyaya, kusumanjali, this, is, discussed, against, the, proposition, of, the, mimamsa, school, that, let, us, assume, there, were, many, demigods, devas, and, sages, rishis, in, the, beginning, who, wrote, the, vedas, and, created, the, world, nyaya, says, that, omniscient, beings, those, endowed, with, the, various, superhuman, faculties, of, assuming, infinitesimal, size, and, so, on, and, capable, of, creating, everything, then, we, reply, that, the, law, of, parsimony, bids, us, assume, only, one, such, namely, him, the, adorable, lord, there, can, be, no, confidence, in, a, non, eternal, and, non, omniscient, being, and, hence, it, follows, that, according, to, the, system, which, rejects, god, the, tradition, of, the, veda, is, simultaneously, overthrown, there, is, no, other, way, open, in, other, words, nyaya, says, that, the, polytheist, would, have, to, give, elaborate, proofs, for, the, existence, and, origin, of, his, several, celestial, spirits, none, of, which, would, be, logical, and, that, it, is, more, logical, to, assume, one, eternal, omniscient, god, many, other, hindus, however, view, polytheism, as, far, preferable, to, monotheism, the, famous, hindu, revitalist, leader, ram, swarup, for, example, points, to, the, vedas, as, being, specifically, polytheistic, and, states, that, only, some, form, of, polytheism, alone, can, do, justice, to, this, variety, and, richness, sita, ram, goel, another, 20th, century,

the, singularity, of, the, creator, together, the, word, means, one, universal, creator, god, it, is, often, said, that, the, 1430, pages, of, the, guru, granth, sahib, are, all, expansions, on, the, mul, mantra, although, the, sikhs, have, many, names, for, god, some, derived, from, islam, and, hinduism, they, all, refer, to, the, same, supreme, being, the, sikh, holy, scriptures, refer, to, the, one, god, who, pervades, the, whole, of, space, and, is, the, creator, of, all, beings, in, the, universe, the, following, quotation, from, the, guru, granth, sahib, highlights, this, point, chant,

as, akal, purakh, which, means, the, immortal, being, or, waheguru, the, wondrous, enlightener, critics, have, described, monotheism, as, a, cause, of, ignorance, oppression, and, violence, david, hume, 1711, 1776, said, that, monotheism, is, less, pluralistic, and, thus, less, tolerant, than, polytheism, because, monotheism, stipulates, that, people, pigeonhole, their, beliefs, into, one, tenet, in, the, same, vein, auguste, comte, said, that, monotheism, is, irreconcilable, with, the, existence, in, our, nature, of, the, instincts, of, benevolence, because, it, compels, followers, to,
