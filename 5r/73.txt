a, mental, representation, or, cognitive, representation, in, philosophy, of, mind, cognitive, psychology, neuroscience, and, cognitive, science, is, a, hypothetical, internal, cognitive, symbol, that, represents, external, reality, or, its, abstractions, mental, representation, is, the, mental, imagery, of, things, that, are, not, actually, present, to, the, senses, in, contemporary, philosophy, specifically, in, fields, of, metaphysics, such, as, philosophy, of, mind, and, ontology, a, mental, representation, is, one, of, the, prevailing, ways, of, explaining, and, describing, the, nature, of, ideas, and, concepts, mental, representations, or, mental, imagery, enable, representing, things, that, have, never, been, experienced, as, well, as, things, that, do, not, exist, our, brains, and, mental, imageries, allow, us, to, imagine, things, have, either, never, happened, or, are, impossible, and, do, not, exist, although, visual, imagery, is, more, likely, to, be, recalled, mental, imagery, may, involve, representations, in, any, of, the, sensory, modalities, such, as, hearing, smell, or, taste, stephen, kosslyn, proposes, that, images, are, used, to, help, solve, certain, types, of, problems, we, are, able, to, visualize, the, objects, in, question, and, mentally, represent, the, images, to, solve, it, mental, representations, also, allow, people, to, experience, things, right, in, front, of, them, however, the, process, of, how, the, brain, interprets, and, stores, the, representational, content, is, debated, representationalism, also, known, as, indirect, realism, is, the, view, that, representations, are, the, main, way, we, access, external, reality, the, representational, theory, of, mind, attempts, to, explain, the, nature, of, ideas, concepts, and, other, mental, content, in, contemporary, philosophy, of, mind, cognitive, science, and, experimental, psychology, in, contrast, to, theories, of, na, ve, or, direct, realism, the, representational, theory, of, mind, postulates, the, actual, existence, of, mental, representations, which, act, as, intermediaries, between, the, observing, subject, and, the, objects, processes, or, other, entities, observed, in, the, external, world, these, intermediaries, stand, for, or, represent, to, the, mind, the, objects, of, that, world, the, original, or, classical, representational, theory, probably, can, be, traced, back, to, thomas, hobbes, and, was, a, dominant, theme, in, classical, empiricism, in, general, according, to, this, version, of, the, theory, the, mental, representations, were, images, often, called, ideas, of, the, objects, or, states, of, affairs, represented, for, modern, adherents, such, as, jerry, fodor, and, steven, pinker, the, representational, system, consists, rather, of, an, internal, language, of, thought, i, e, mentalese, the, contents, of, thoughts, are, represented, in, symbolic, structures, the, formulas, of, mentalese, which, analogously, to, natural, languages, but, on, a, much, more, abstract, level, possess, a, syntax, and, semantics, very, much, like, those, of, natural, languages, for, the, portuguese, logician, and, cognitive, scientist, luis, m, augusto, at, this, abstract, formal, level, the, syntax, of, thought, is, the, set, of, symbol, rules, i, e, operations, processes, etc, on, and, with, symbol, structures, and, the, semantics, of, thought, is, the, set, of, symbol, structures, concepts, and, propositions, content, i, e, thought, emerges, from, the, meaningful, co, occurrence, of, both, sets, of, symbols, for, instance, 8, x, 9, is, a, meaningful, co, occurrence, whereas, cat, x, is, not, x, is, a, symbol, rule, called, for, by, symbol, structures, such, as, 8, and, 9, but, not, by, cat, and, canadian, philosopher, p, thagard, noted, in, his, work, introduction, to, cognitive, science, that, most, cognitive, scientists, agree, that, knowledge, in, the, human, mind, consists, of, mental, representations, and, that, cognitive, science, asserts, that, people, have, mental, procedures, that, operate, by, means, of, mental, representations, for, the, implementation, of, thinking, and, action, there, are, two, types, of, representationalism, strong, and, weak, strong, representationalism, attempts, to, reduce, phenomenal, character, to, intentional, content, on, the, other, hand, weak, representationalism, claims, only, that, phenomenal, character, supervenes, on, intentional, content, strong, representationalism, aims, to, provide, a, theory, about, the, nature, of, phenomenal, character, and, offers, a, solution, to, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, in, contrast, to, this, weak, representationalism, does, not, aim, to, provide, a, theory, of, consciousness, nor, does, it, offer, a, solution, to, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, strong, representationalism, can, be, further, broken, down, into, restricted, and, unrestricted, versions, the, restricted, version, deals, only, with, certain, kinds, of, phenomenal, states, e, g, visual, perception, most, representationalists, endorse, an, unrestricted, version, of, representationalism, according, to, the, unrestricted, version, for, any, state, with, phenomenal, character, that, state, s, phenomenal, character, reduces, to, its, intentional, content, only, this, unrestricted, version, of, representationalism, is, able, to, provide, a, general, theory, about, the, nature, of, phenomenal, character, as, well, as, offer, a, potential, solution, to, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, the, successful, reduction, of, the, phenomenal, character, of, a, state, to, its, intentional, content, would, provide, a, solution, to, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, once, a, physicalist, account, of, intentionality, is, worked, out, when, arguing, against, the, unrestricted, version, of, representationalism, people, will, often, bring, up, phenomenal, mental, states, that, appear, to, lack, intentional, content, the, unrestricted, version, seeks, to, account, for, all, phenomenal, states, thus, for, it, to, be, true, all, states, with, phenomenal, character, must, have, intentional, content, to, which, that, character, is, reduced, phenomenal, states, without, intentional, content, therefore, serve, as, a, counterexample, to, the, unrestricted, version, if, the, state, has, no, intentional, content, its, phenomenal, character, will, not, be, reducible, to, that, state, s, intentional, content, for, it, has, none, to, begin, with, a, common, example, of, this, kind, of, state, are, moods, moods, are, states, with, phenomenal, character, that, are, generally, thought, to, not, be, directed, at, anything, in, particular, moods, are, thought, to, lack, directedness, unlike, emotions, which, are, typically, thought, to, be, directed, at, particular, things, people, conclude, that, because, moods, are, undirected, they, are, also, nonintentional, i, e, they, lack, intentionality, or, aboutness, because, they, are, not, directed, at, anything, they, are, not, about, anything, because, they, lack, intentionality, they, will, lack, any, intentional, content, lacking, intentional, content, their, phenomenal, character, will, not, be, reducible, to, intentional, content, refuting, the, representational, doctrine, though, emotions, are, typically, considered, as, having, directedness, and, intentionality, this, idea, has, also, been, called, into, question, one, might, point, to, emotions, a, person, all, of, a, sudden, experiences, that, do, not, appear, to, be, directed, at, or, about, anything, in, particular, emotions, elicited, by, listening, to, music, are, another, potential, example, of, undirected, nonintentional, emotions, emotions, aroused, in, this, way, do, not, seem, to, necessarily, be, about, anything, including, the, music, that, arouses, them, in, response, to, this, objection, a, proponent, of, representationalism, might, reject, the, undirected, non, intentionality, of, moods, and, attempt, to, identify, some, intentional, content, they, might, plausibly, be, thought, to, possess, the, proponent, of, representationalism, might, also, reject, the, narrow, conception, of, intentionality, as, being, directed, at, a, particular, thing, arguing, instead, for, a, broader, kind, of, intentionality, there, are, three, alternative, kinds, of, directedness, intentionality, one, might, posit, for, moods, in, the, case, of, outward, directedness, moods, might, be, directed, at, either, the, world, as, a, whole, a, changing, series, of, objects, in, the, world, or, unbound, emotion, properties, projected, by, people, onto, things, in, the, world, in, the, case, of, inward, directedness, moods, are, directed, at, the, overall, state, of, a, person, s, body, in, the, case, of, hybrid, directedness, moods, are, directed, at, some, combination, of, inward, and, outward, things, even, if, one, can, identify, some, possible, intentional, content, for, moods, we, might, still, question, whether, that, content, is, able, to, sufficiently, capture, the, phenomenal, character, of, the, mood, states, they, are, a, part, of, amy, kind, contends, that, in, the, case, of, all, the, previously, mentioned, kinds, of, directedness, outward, inward, and, hybrid, the, intentional, content, supplied, to, the, mood, state, is, not, capable, of, sufficiently, capturing, the, phenomenal, aspects, of, the, mood, states, in, the, case, of, inward, directedness, the, phenomenology, of, the, mood, does, not, seem, tied, to, the, state, of, one, s, body, and, even, if, one, s, mood, is, reflected, by, the, overall, state, of, one, s, body, that, person, will, not, necessarily, be, aware, of, it, demonstrating, the, insufficiency, of, the, intentional, content, to, adequately, capture, the, phenomenal, aspects, of, the, mood, in, the, case, of, outward, directedness, the, phenomenology, of, the, mood, and, its, intentional, content, does, not, seem, to, share, the, corresponding, relation, they, should, given, that, the, phenomenal, character, is, supposed, to, reduce, to, the, intentional, content, hybrid, directedness, if, it, can, even, get, off, the, ground, faces, the, same, objection, there, is, a, wide, debate, on, what, kinds, of, representations, exist, there, are, several, philosophers, who, bring, about, different, aspects, of, the, debate, such, philosophers, include, alex, morgan, gualtiero, piccinini, and, uriah, kriegel, there, are, job, description, representations, that, is, representations, that, represent, something, have, intentionality, have, a, special, relation, the, represented, object, does, not, need, to, exist, and, content, plays, a, causal, role, in, what, gets, represented, structural, representations, are, also, important, these, types, of, representations, are, basically, mental, maps, that, we, have, in, our, minds, that, correspond, exactly, to, those, objects, in, the, world, the, intentional, content, according, to, morgan, structural, representations, are, not, the, same, as, mental, representations, there, is, nothing, mental, about, them, plants, can, have, structural, representations, there, are, also, internal, representations, these, types, of, representations, include, those, that, involve, future, decisions, episodic, memories, or, any, type, of, projection, into, the, future, in, gualtiero, piccinini, s, forthcoming, work, he, discusses, topics, on, natural, and, nonnatural, mental, representations, he, relies, on, the, natural, definition, of, mental, representations, given, by, grice, 1957, where, p, entails, that, p, e, g, those, spots, mean, measles, entails, that, the, patient, has, measles, then, there, are, nonnatural, representations, p, does, not, entail, p, e, g, the, 3, rings, on, the, bell, of, a, bus, mean, the, bus, is, full, the, rings, on, the, bell, are, independent, of, the, fullness, of, the, bus, we, could, have, assigned, something, else, just, as, arbitrary, to, signify, that, the, bus, is, full, there, are, also, objective, and, subjective, mental, representations, objective, representations, are, closest, to, tracking, theories, where, the, brain, simply, tracks, what, is, in, the, environment, subjective, representations, can, vary, person, to, person, the, relationship, between, these, two, types, of, representation, can, vary, eliminativists, think, that, subjective, representations, do, not, exist, reductivists, think, subjective, representations, are, reducible, to, objective, non, reductivists, think, that, subjective, representations, are, real, and, distinct
