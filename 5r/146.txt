a, mummy, is, a, dead, human, or, an, animal, whose, soft, tissues, and, organs, have, been, preserved, by, either, intentional, or, accidental, exposure, to, chemicals, extreme, cold, very, low, humidity, or, lack, of, air, so, that, the, recovered, body, does, not, decay, further, if, kept, in, cool, and, dry, conditions, some, authorities, restrict, the, use, of, the, term, to, bodies, deliberately, embalmed, with, chemicals, but, the, use, of, the, word, to, cover, accidentally, desiccated, bodies, goes, back, to, at, least, the, early, 17th, century, mummies, of, humans, and, animals, have, been, found, on, every, continent, both, as, a, result, of, natural, preservation, through, unusual, conditions, and, as, cultural, artifacts, over, one, million, animal, mummies, have, been, found, in, egypt, many, of, which, are, cats, many, of, the, egyptian, animal, mummies, are, sacred, ibis, and, radiocarbon, dating, suggests, the, egyptian, ibis, mummies, that, have, been, analyzed, were, from, a, time, frame, that, falls, between, approximately, 450, and, 250, bc, in, addition, to, the, mummies, of, ancient, egypt, deliberate, mummification, was, a, feature, of, several, ancient, cultures, in, areas, of, america, and, asia, with, very, dry, climates, the, spirit, cave, mummies, of, fallon, nevada, in, north, america, were, accurately, dated, at, more, than, 9, 400, years, old, before, this, discovery, the, oldest, known, deliberate, mummy, was, a, child, one, of, the, chinchorro, mummies, found, in, the, camarones, valley, chile, which, dates, around, 5050, bc, the, oldest, known, naturally, mummified, human, corpse, is, a, severed, head, dated, as, 6, 000, years, old, found, in, 1936, at, the, cueva, de, las, momias, in, argentina, the, english, word, mummy, is, derived, from, medieval, latin, mumia, a, borrowing, of, the, medieval, arabic, word, m, miya, which, meant, an, embalmed, corpse, as, well, as, the, bituminous, embalming, substance, this, word, was, borrowed, from, persian, where, it, meant, asphalt, and, is, derived, from, the, word, m, m, meaning, wax, the, meaning, of, corpse, preserved, by, desiccation, developed, post, medievally, the, medieval, english, term, mummy, was, defined, as, medical, preparation, of, the, substance, of, mummies, rather, than, the, entire, corpse, with, richard, hakluyt, in, 1599, ad, complaining, that, these, dead, bodies, are, the, mummy, which, the, phisistians, and, apothecaries, doe, against, our, willes, make, us, to, swallow, these, substances, were, called, mummia, the, oed, defines, a, mummy, as, the, body, of, a, human, being, or, animal, embalmed, according, to, the, ancient, egyptian, or, some, analogous, method, as, a, preparation, for, burial, citing, sources, from, 1615, ad, onward, however, chamber, s, cyclop, dia, and, the, victorian, zoologist, francis, trevelyan, buckland, define, a, mummy, as, follows, a, human, or, animal, body, desiccated, by, exposure, to, sun, or, air, also, applied, to, the, frozen, carcase, of, an, animal, imbedded, in, prehistoric, snow, wasps, of, the, genus, aleiodes, are, known, as, mummy, wasps, because, they, wrap, their, caterpillar, prey, as, mummies, while, interest, in, the, study, of, mummies, dates, as, far, back, as, ptolemaic, greece, most, structured, scientific, study, began, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, prior, to, this, many, rediscovered, mummies, were, sold, as, curiosities, or, for, use, in, pseudoscientific, novelties, such, as, mummia, the, first, modern, scientific, examinations, of, mummies, began, in, 1901, conducted, by, professors, at, the, english, language, government, school, of, medicine, in, cairo, egypt, the, first, x, ray, of, a, mummy, came, in, 1903, when, professors, grafton, elliot, smith, and, howard, carter, used, the, only, x, ray, machine, in, cairo, at, the, time, to, examine, the, mummified, body, of, thutmose, iv, british, chemist, alfred, lucas, applied, chemical, analyses, to, egyptian, mummies, during, this, same, period, which, returned, many, results, about, the, types, of, substances, used, in, embalming, lucas, also, made, significant, contributions, to, the, analysis, of, tutankhamun, in, 1922, pathological, study, of, mummies, saw, varying, levels, of, popularity, throughout, the, 20th, century, in, 1992, the, first, world, congress, on, mummy, studies, was, held, in, puerto, de, la, cruz, on, tenerife, in, the, canary, islands, more, than, 300, scientists, attended, the, congress, to, share, nearly, 100, years, of, collected, data, on, mummies, the, information, presented, at, the, meeting, triggered, a, new, surge, of, interest, in, the, subject, with, one, of, the, major, results, being, the, integration, of, biomedical, and, bioarchaeological, information, on, mummies, with, existing, databases, this, was, not, possible, prior, to, the, congress, due, to, the, unique, and, highly, specialized, techniques, required, to, gather, such, data, in, more, recent, years, ct, scanning, has, become, an, invaluable, tool, in, the, study, of, mummification, by, allowing, researchers, to, digitally, unwrap, mummies, without, risking, damage, to, the, body, the, level, of, detail, in, such, scans, is, so, intricate, that, small, linens, used, in, tiny, areas, such, as, the, nostrils, can, be, digitally, reconstructed, in, 3, d, such, modelling, has, been, utilized, to, perform, digital, autopsies, on, mummies, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, and, lifestyle, such, as, in, the, case, of, tutankhamun, mummies, are, typically, divided, into, one, of, two, distinct, categories, anthropogenic, or, spontaneous, anthropogenic, mummies, were, deliberately, created, by, the, living, for, any, number, of, reasons, the, most, common, being, for, religious, purposes, spontaneous, mummies, such, as, tzi, and, the, maronite, mummies, were, created, unintentionally, due, to, natural, conditions, such, as, extremely, dry, heat, or, cold, or, acidic, and, anaerobic, conditions, such, as, those, found, in, bogs, while, most, individual, mummies, exclusively, belong, to, one, category, or, the, other, there, are, examples, of, both, types, being, connected, to, a, single, culture, such, as, those, from, the, ancient, egyptian, culture, and, the, andean, cultures, of, south, america, some, of, the, later, well, preserved, corpses, of, the, mummification, were, found, under, christian, churches, such, as, the, mummified, vicar, nicolaus, rungius, found, under, the, st, michael, church, in, keminmaa, finland, there, are, also, cases, that, fall, outside, of, these, categories, until, recently, it, was, believed, that, the, earliest, ancient, egyptian, mummies, were, created, naturally, due, to, the, environment, in, which, they, were, buried, in, 2014, an, 11, year, study, by, the, university, of, york, macquarie, university, and, the, university, of, oxford, suggested, that, artificial, mummification, occurred, 1, 500, years, earlier, than, first, thought, this, was, confirmed, in, 2018, when, tests, on, a, 5, 600, year, old, mummy, in, turin, revealed, that, it, had, been, deliberately, mummified, using, linen, wrappings, and, embalming, oils, made, from, conifer, resin, and, aromatic, plant, extracts, the, preservation, of, the, dead, had, a, profound, effect, on, ancient, egyptian, religion, mummification, was, an, integral, part, of, the, rituals, for, the, dead, beginning, as, early, as, the, 2nd, dynasty, about, 2800, bc, egyptians, saw, the, preservation, of, the, body, after, death, as, an, important, step, to, living, well, in, the, afterlife, as, egypt, gained, more, prosperity, burial, practices, became, a, status, symbol, for, the, wealthy, as, well, this, cultural, hierarchy, led, to, the, creation, of, elaborate, tombs, and, more, sophisticated, methods, of, embalming, by, the, 4th, dynasty, about, 2600, bc, egyptian, embalmers, began, to, achieve, true, mummification, through, a, process, of, evisceration, much, of, this, early, experimentation, with, mummification, in, egypt, is, unknown, the, few, documents, that, directly, describe, the, mummification, process, date, to, the, greco, roman, period, the, majority, of, the, papyri, that, have, survived, only, describe, the, ceremonial, rituals, involved, in, embalming, not, the, actual, surgical, processes, involved, a, text, known, as, the, ritual, of, embalming, does, describe, some, of, the, practical, logistics, of, embalming, however, there, are, only, two, known, copies, and, each, is, incomplete, with, regards, to, mummification, shown, in, images, there, are, apparently, also, very, few, the, tomb, of, tjay, designated, tt23, is, one, of, only, two, known, which, show, the, wrapping, of, a, mummy, riggs, 2014, another, text, that, describes, the, processes, being, used, in, the, latter, periods, is, herodotus, histories, written, in, book, 2, of, the, histories, is, one, of, the, most, detailed, descriptions, of, the, egyptian, mummification, process, including, the, mention, of, using, natron, in, order, to, dehydrate, corpses, for, preservation, however, these, descriptions, are, short, and, fairly, vague, leaving, scholars, to, infer, the, majority, of, the, techniques, that, were, used, by, studying, mummies, that, have, been, unearthed, by, utilizing, current, advancements, in, technology, scientists, have, been, able, to, uncover, a, plethora, of, new, information, about, the, techniques, used, in, mummification, a, series, of, ct, scans, performed, on, a, 2, 400, year, old, mummy, in, 2008, revealed, a, tool, that, was, left, inside, the, cranial, cavity, of, the, skull, the, tool, was, a, rod, made, of, an, organic, material, that, was, used, to, break, apart, the, brain, to, allow, it, to, drain, out, of, the, nose, this, discovery, helped, to, dispel, the, claim, within, herodotus, works, that, the, rod, had, been, a, hook, made, of, iron, earlier, experimentation, in, 1994, by, researchers, bob, brier, and, ronald, wade, supported, these, findings, while, attempting, to, replicate, egyptian, mummification, brier, and, wade, discovered, that, removal, of, the, brain, was, much, easier, when, the, brain, was, liquefied, and, allowed, to, drain, with, the, help, of, gravity, as, opposed, to, trying, to, pull, the, organ, out, piece, by, piece, with, a, hook, through, various, methods, of, study, over, many, decades, modern, egyptologists, now, have, an, accurate, understanding, of, how, mummification, was, achieved, in, ancient, egypt, the, first, and, most, important, step, was, to, halt, the, process, of, decomposition, by, removing, the, internal, organs, and, washing, out, the, body, with, a, mix, of, spices, and, palm, wine, the, only, organ, left, behind, was, the, heart, as, tradition, held, the, heart, was, the, seat, of, thought, and, feeling, and, would, therefore, still, be, needed, in, the, afterlife, after, cleansing, the, body, was, then, dried, out, with, natron, inside, the, empty, body, cavity, as, well, as, outside, on, the, skin, the, internal, organs, were, also, dried, and, either, sealed, in, individual, jars, or, wrapped, to, be, replaced, within, the, body, this, process, typically, took, forty, days, after, dehydration, the, mummy, was, wrapped, in, many, layers, of, linen, cloth, within, the, layers, egyptian, priests, placed, small, amulets, to, guard, the, decedent, from, evil, once, the, mummy, was, completely, wrapped, it, was, coated, in, resin, in, order, to, keep, the, threat, of, moist, air, away, the, resin, was, also, applied, to, the, coffin, in, order, to, seal, it, the, mummy, was, then, sealed, within, its, tomb, alongside, the, worldly, goods, that, were, believed, to, help, aid, it, in, the, afterlife, aspergillus, niger, a, hardy, species, of, fungus, capable, of, living, in, a, variety, of, environments, has, been, found, in, the, mummies, of, ancient, egyptian, tombs, and, can, be, inhaled, when, they, are, disturbed, mummification, is, one, of, the, defining, customs, in, ancient, egyptian, society, for, people, today, the, practice, of, preserving, the, human, body, is, believed, to, be, a, quintessential, feature, of, egyptian, life, yet, even, mummification, has, a, history, of, development, and, was, accessible, to, different, ranks, of, society, in, different, ways, during, different, periods, there, were, at, least, three, different, processes, of, mummification, according, to, herodotus, they, range, from, the, most, perfect, to, the, method, employed, by, the, poorer, classes, the, most, expensive, process, was, to, preserve, the, body, by, dehydration, and, protect, against, pests, such, as, insects, almost, all, of, the, actions, herodotus, described, served, one, of, these, two, functions, first, the, brain, was, removed, from, the, cranium, through, the, nose, the, gray, matter, was, discarded, modern, mummy, excavations, have, shown, that, instead, of, an, iron, hook, inserted, through, the, nose, as, herodotus, claims, a, rod, was, used, to, liquefy, the, brain, via, the, cranium, which, then, drained, out, the, nose, by, gravity, the, embalmers, then, rinsed, the, skull, with, certain, drugs, that, mostly, cleared, any, residue, of, brain, tissue, and, also, had, the, effect, of, killing, bacteria, next, the, embalmers, made, an, incision, along, the, flank, with, a, sharp, blade, fashioned, from, an, ethiopian, stone, and, removed, the, contents, of, the, abdomen, herodotus, does, not, discuss, the, separate, preservation, of, these, organs, and, their, placement, either, in, special, jars, or, back, in, the, cavity, a, process, that, was, part, of, the, most, expensive, embalming, according, to, archaeological, evidence, the, abdominal, cavity, was, then, rinsed, with, palm, wine, and, an, infusion, of, crushed, fragrant, herbs, and, spices, the, cavity, was, then, filled, with, spices, including, myrrh, cassia, and, herodotus, notes, every, other, sort, of, spice, except, frankincense, also, to, preserve, the, person, the, body, was, further, dehydrated, by, placing, it, in, natron, a, naturally, occurring, salt, for, 70, days, herodotus, insists, that, the, body, did, not, stay, in, the, natron, longer, than, 70, days, any, shorter, time, and, the, body, would, not, be, completely, dehydrated, any, longer, and, the, body, would, be, too, stiff, to, move, into, position, for, wrapping, the, embalmers, then, washed, the, body, again, and, wrapped, it, with, linen, bandages, the, bandages, were, covered, with, a, gum, that, modern, research, has, shown, is, both, a, waterproofing, agent, and, an, antimicrobial, agent, at, this, point, the, body, was, given, back, to, the, family, these, perfect, mummies, were, then, placed, in, human, shaped, wooden, cases, wealthy, people, placed, these, wooden, cases, in, stone, sarcophagi, that, provided, further, protection, the, family, placed, the, sarcophagus, in, the, tomb, upright, against, the, wall, according, to, herodotus, the, second, process, that, herodotus, describes, was, used, by, middle, class, people, or, people, who, wish, to, avoid, expense, in, this, method, an, oil, derived, from, cedar, trees, was, injected, with, a, syringe, into, the, abdomen, a, rectal, plug, prevented, the, oil, from, escaping, this, oil, probably, had, the, dual, purpose, of, liquefying, the, internal, organs, but, also, of, disinfecting, the, abdominal, cavity, by, liquefying, the, organs, the, family, avoided, the, expense, of, canopic, jars, and, separate, preservation, the, body, was, then, placed, in, natron, for, seventy, days, at, the, end, of, this, time, the, body, was, removed, and, the, cedar, oil, now, containing, the, liquefied, organs, was, drained, through, the, rectum, with, the, body, dehydrated, it, could, be, returned, to, the, family, herodotus, does, not, describe, the, process, of, burial, of, such, mummies, but, they, were, perhaps, placed, in, a, shaft, tomb, poorer, people, used, coffins, fashioned, from, terracotta, the, third, and, least, expensive, method, the, embalmers, offered, was, to, clear, the, intestines, with, an, unnamed, liquid, injected, as, an, enema, the, body, was, then, placed, in, natron, for, seventy, days, and, returned, to, the, family, herodotus, gives, no, further, details, in, christian, tradition, some, bodies, of, saints, are, naturally, conserved, and, venerated, in, addition, to, the, mummies, of, egypt, there, have, been, instances, of, mummies, being, discovered, in, other, areas, of, the, african, continent, the, bodies, show, a, mix, of, anthropogenic, and, spontaneous, mummification, with, some, being, thousands, of, years, old, the, mummies, of, the, canary, islands, belong, to, the, indigenous, guanche, people, and, date, to, the, time, before, 14th, century, spanish, explorers, settled, in, the, area, all, deceased, people, within, the, guanche, culture, were, mummified, during, this, time, though, the, level, of, care, taken, with, embalming, and, burial, varied, depending, on, individual, social, status, embalming, was, carried, out, by, specialized, groups, organized, according, to, gender, who, were, considered, unclean, by, the, rest, of, the, community, the, techniques, for, embalming, were, similar, to, those, of, the, ancient, egyptians, involving, evisceration, preservation, and, stuffing, of, the, evacuated, bodily, cavities, then, wrapping, the, body, in, animal, skins, despite, the, successful, techniques, utilized, by, the, guanche, very, few, mummies, remain, due, to, looting, and, desecration, the, mummified, remains, of, an, infant, were, discovered, during, an, expedition, by, archaeologist, fabrizio, mori, to, libya, during, the, winter, of, 1958, 1959, in, the, natural, cave, structure, of, uan, muhuggiag, after, curious, deposits, and, cave, paintings, were, discovered, on, the, surfaces, of, the, cave, expedition, leaders, decided, to, excavate, uncovered, alongside, fragmented, animal, bone, tools, was, the, mummified, body, of, an, infant, wrapped, in, animal, skin, and, wearing, a, necklace, made, of, ostrich, egg, shell, beads, professor, tongiorgi, of, the, university, of, pisa, radiocarbon, dated, the, infant, to, between, 5, 000, and, 8, 000, years, old, a, long, incision, located, on, the, right, abdominal, wall, and, the, absence, of, internal, organs, indicated, that, the, body, had, been, eviscerated, post, mortem, possibly, in, an, effort, to, preserve, the, remains, a, bundle, of, herbs, found, within, the, body, cavity, also, supported, this, conclusion, further, research, revealed, that, the, child, had, been, around, 30, months, old, at, the, time, of, death, though, gender, could, not, be, determined, due, to, poor, preservation, of, the, sex, organs, the, first, mummy, to, be, discovered, in, south, africa, was, found, in, the, baviaanskloof, wilderness, area, by, dr, johan, binneman, in, 1999, nicknamed, moses, the, mummy, was, estimated, to, be, around, 2, 000, years, old, after, being, linked, to, the, indigenous, khoi, culture, of, the, region, the, national, council, of, khoi, chiefs, of, south, africa, began, to, make, legal, demands, that, the, mummy, be, returned, shortly, after, the, body, was, moved, to, the, albany, museum, in, grahamstown, the, mummies, of, asia, are, usually, considered, to, be, accidental, the, decedents, were, buried, in, just, the, right, place, where, the, environment, could, act, as, an, agent, for, preservation, this, is, particularly, common, in, the, desert, areas, of, the, tarim, basin, and, iran, mummies, have, been, discovered, in, more, humid, asian, climates, however, these, are, subject, to, rapid, decay, after, being, removed, from, the, grave, mummies, from, various, dynasties, throughout, china, s, history, have, been, discovered, in, several, locations, across, the, country, they, are, almost, exclusively, considered, to, be, unintentional, mummifications, many, areas, in, which, mummies, have, been, uncovered, are, difficult, for, preservation, due, to, their, warm, moist, climates, this, makes, the, recovery, of, mummies, a, challenge, as, exposure, to, the, outside, world, can, cause, the, bodies, to, decay, in, a, matter, of, hours, an, example, of, a, chinese, mummy, that, was, preserved, despite, being, buried, in, an, environment, not, conducive, to, mummification, is, xin, zhui, also, known, as, lady, dai, she, was, discovered, in, the, early, 1970s, at, the, mawangdui, archaeological, site, in, changsha, she, was, the, wife, of, the, marquis, of, dai, during, the, han, dynasty, who, was, also, buried, with, her, alongside, another, young, man, often, considered, to, be, a, very, close, relative, however, xin, zhui, s, body, was, the, only, one, of, the, three, to, be, mummified, her, corpse, was, so, well, preserved, that, surgeons, from, the, hunan, provincial, medical, institute, were, able, to, perform, an, autopsy, the, exact, reason, why, her, body, was, so, completely, preserved, has, yet, to, be, determined, among, the, mummies, discovered, in, china, are, those, termed, tarim, mummies, because, of, their, discovery, in, the, tarim, basin, the, dry, desert, climate, of, the, basin, proved, to, be, an, excellent, agent, for, desiccation, for, this, reason, over, 200, tarim, mummies, which, are, over, 4, 000, years, old, were, excavated, from, a, cemetery, in, the, present, day, xinjiang, region, the, mummies, were, found, buried, in, upside, down, boats, with, hundreds, of, 13, foot, long, wooden, poles, in, the, place, of, tombstones, dna, sequence, data, shows, that, the, mummies, had, haplogroup, r1a, y, dna, characteristic, of, western, eurasia, in, the, area, of, east, central, europe, central, asia, and, the, indus, valley, this, has, created, a, stir, in, the, turkic, speaking, uighur, population, of, the, region, who, claim, the, area, has, always, belonged, to, their, culture, while, it, was, not, until, the, 10th, century, that, uighurs, are, said, by, scholars, to, have, moved, to, the, region, from, central, asia, american, sinologist, victor, h, mair, claims, that, the, earliest, mummies, in, the, tarim, basin, were, exclusively, caucasoid, or, europoid, with, east, asian, migrants, arriving, in, the, eastern, portions, of, the, tarim, basin, around, 3, 000, years, ago, while, mair, also, notes, that, it, was, not, until, 842, that, the, uighur, peoples, settled, in, the, area, other, mummified, remains, have, been, recovered, from, around, the, tarim, basin, at, sites, including, q, wrighul, yanghai, shengjindian, shanpula, sampul, zaghunluq, and, qizilchoqa, as, of, 2012, at, least, eight, mummified, human, remains, have, been, recovered, from, the, douzlakh, salt, mine, at, chehr, abad, in, northwestern, iran, due, to, their, salt, preservation, these, bodies, are, collectively, known, as, saltmen, carbon, 14, testing, conducted, in, 2008, dated, three, of, the, bodies, to, around, 400, bc, later, isotopic, research, on, the, other, mummies, returned, similar, dates, however, many, of, these, individuals, were, found, to, be, from, a, region, that, is, not, closely, associated, with, the, mine, it, was, during, this, time, that, researchers, determined, the, mine, suffered, a, major, collapse, which, likely, caused, the, death, of, the, miners, since, there, is, significant, archaeological, data, that, indicates, the, area, was, not, actively, inhabited, during, this, time, period, current, consensus, holds, that, the, accident, occurred, during, a, brief, period, of, temporary, mining, activity, in, 1990, a, team, of, speleologists, uncovered, eight, mummies, dating, back, to, around, 1283, ad, during, a, rescue, excavation, in, the, e, asi, al, hadath, cave, in, the, qadisha, valley, of, lebanon, the, well, preserved, spontaneous, mummies, including, an, infant, named, dubbed, yasmine, offer, insights, into, maronite, villagers, lives, during, the, mamluk, era, the, grotto, s, high, altitude, and, dry, conditions, naturally, mummified, the, bodies, the, discovery, provides, historical, context, aligning, with, documented, mamluk, raids, in, the, region, artifacts, including, pottery, with, inscriptions, manuscripts, and, clothing, suggest, a, maronite, community, and, the, mummies, burial, practices, parallel, present, day, lebanese, customs, the, remains, were, called, maronite, mummies, because, the, individuals, found, in, the, asi, al, hadath, cave, were, believed, to, be, maronites, an, indigenous, christian, community, in, the, region, some, of, the, mummies, have, been, transferred, to, the, national, museum, of, beirut, in, 1993, a, team, of, russian, archaeologists, led, by, dr, natalia, polosmak, discovered, the, siberian, ice, maiden, a, scytho, siberian, woman, on, the, ukok, plateau, in, the, altai, mountains, near, the, mongolian, border, the, mummy, was, naturally, frozen, due, to, the, severe, climatic, conditions, of, the, siberian, steppe, also, known, as, princess, ukok, the, mummy, was, dressed, in, finely, detailed, clothing, and, wore, an, elaborate, headdress, and, jewelry, alongside, her, body, were, buried, six, decorated, horses, and, a, symbolic, meal, for, her, last, journey, her, left, arm, and, hand, were, tattooed, with, animal, style, figures, including, a, highly, stylized, deer, the, ice, maiden, has, been, a, source, of, some, recent, controversy, the, mummy, s, skin, has, suffered, some, slight, decay, and, the, tattoos, have, faded, since, the, excavation, some, residents, of, the, altai, republic, formed, after, the, breakup, of, the, soviet, union, have, requested, the, return, of, the, ice, maiden, who, is, currently, stored, in, novosibirsk, in, siberia, another, siberian, mummy, a, man, was, discovered, much, earlier, in, 1929, his, skin, was, also, marked, with, tattoos, of, two, monsters, resembling, griffins, which, decorated, his, chest, and, three, partially, obliterated, images, which, seem, to, represent, two, deer, and, a, mountain, goat, on, his, left, arm, philippine, mummies, are, called, kabayan, mummies, they, are, common, in, igorot, culture, and, their, heritage, the, mummies, are, found, in, some, areas, named, kabayan, sagada, and, among, others, the, mummies, are, dated, between, the, 14th, and, 19th, centuries, mummies, have, been, discovered, in, korea, that, have, been, dated, to, around, the, 15th, to, 19th, centuries, during, the, joseon, period, this, is, thought, to, be, because, of, the, rise, of, neo, confucianism, in, korea, which, prescribed, certain, burial, practices, that, created, conditions, favorable, to, mummification, however, this, mummification, was, likely, unintentional, and, even, culturally, seen, as, ominous, and, undesirable, mummification, likely, occurred, due, to, a, number, of, factors, one, such, factor, was, the, airtight, seal, especially, as, the, korean, climate, is, unfavorable, to, mummification, around, the, bodies, which, was, achieved, using, a, mix, of, lime, clay, and, sand, recreations, of, the, sealing, process, found, that, chemical, reactions, with, the, lime, possibly, caused, a, high, and, prolonged, release, of, heat, which, killed, bacteria, in, the, bodies, in, addition, a, large, amount, of, clothing, was, usually, placed, inside, tombs, which, led, to, a, shortage, of, oxygen, inside, mummies, buried, using, the, lime, mixture, sealing, technique, reportedly, have, especially, excellently, preserved, soft, skin, and, hair, which, has, enabled, medical, and, genetic, studies, to, be, performed, insights, have, been, offered, into, the, lifestyles, and, pathologies, of, korean, people, during, this, period, specific, diseases, for, each, individual, have, been, identified, the, european, continent, is, home, to, a, diverse, spectrum, of, spontaneous, and, anthropogenic, mummies, some, of, the, best, preserved, mummies, have, come, from, bogs, located, across, the, region, the, capuchin, monks, that, inhabited, the, area, left, behind, hundreds, of, intentionally, preserved, bodies, that, have, provided, insight, into, the, customs, and, cultures, of, people, from, various, eras, one, of, the, oldest, mummies, nicknamed, tzi, was, discovered, on, this, continent, new, mummies, continue, to, be, uncovered, in, europe, well, into, the, 21st, century, great, britain, ireland, germany, the, netherlands, sweden, and, denmark, have, produced, a, number, of, bog, bodies, mummies, of, people, deposited, in, sphagnum, bogs, apparently, as, a, result, of, murder, or, ritual, sacrifices, in, such, cases, the, acidity, of, the, water, low, temperature, and, lack, of, oxygen, combined, to, tan, the, body, s, skin, and, soft, tissues, the, skeleton, typically, disintegrates, over, time, such, mummies, are, remarkably, well, preserved, on, emerging, from, the, bog, with, skin, and, internal, organs, intact, it, is, even, possible, to, determine, the, decedent, s, last, meal, by, examining, stomach, contents, the, haraldsk, r, woman, was, discovered, by, labourers, in, a, bog, in, jutland, in, 1835, she, was, erroneously, identified, as, an, early, medieval, danish, queen, and, for, that, reason, was, placed, in, a, royal, sarcophagus, at, the, saint, nicolai, church, vejle, where, she, currently, remains, another, bog, body, also, from, denmark, known, as, the, tollund, man, was, discovered, in, 1950, the, corpse, was, noted, for, its, excellent, preservation, of, the, face, and, feet, which, appeared, as, if, the, man, had, recently, died, only, the, head, of, tollund, man, remains, due, to, the, decomposition, of, the, rest, of, his, body, which, was, not, preserved, along, with, the, head, the, majority, of, mummies, recovered, in, the, czech, republic, come, from, underground, crypts, while, there, is, some, evidence, of, deliberate, mummification, most, sources, state, that, desiccation, occurred, naturally, due, to, unique, conditions, within, the, crypts, the, capuchin, crypt, in, brno, contains, three, hundred, years, of, mummified, remains, directly, below, the, main, altar, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, when, the, crypt, was, opened, and, continuing, until, the, practice, was, discontinued, in, 1787, the, capuchin, friars, of, the, monastery, would, lay, the, deceased, on, a, pillow, of, bricks, on, the, ground, the, unique, air, quality, and, topsoil, within, the, crypt, naturally, preserved, the, bodies, over, time, approximately, fifty, mummies, were, discovered, in, an, abandoned, crypt, beneath, the, church, of, st, procopius, of, s, zava, in, vamberk, in, the, mid, 1980s, workers, digging, a, trench, accidentally, broke, into, the, crypt, which, began, to, fill, with, waste, water, the, mummies, quickly, began, to, deteriorate, though, thirty, four, were, able, to, be, rescued, and, stored, temporarily, at, the, district, museum, of, the, orlick, mountains, until, they, could, be, returned, to, the, monastery, in, 2000, the, mummies, range, in, age, and, social, status, at, time, of, death, with, at, least, two, children, and, one, priest, the, majority, of, the, vamberk, mummies, date, from, the, 18th, century, the, klatovy, catacombs, currently, house, an, exhibition, of, jesuit, mummies, alongside, some, aristocrats, that, were, originally, interred, between, 1674, and, 1783, in, the, early, 1930s, the, mummies, were, accidentally, damaged, during, repairs, resulting, in, the, loss, of, 140, bodies, the, newly, updated, airing, system, preserves, the, thirty, eight, bodies, that, are, currently, on, display, apart, from, several, bog, bodies, denmark, has, also, yielded, several, other, mummies, such, as, the, three, borum, esh, j, mummies, the, skrydstrup, woman, and, the, egtved, girl, who, were, all, found, inside, burial, mounds, or, tumuli, in, 1875, the, borum, esh, j, grave, mound, was, uncovered, which, had, been, built, around, three, coffins, which, belonged, to, a, middle, aged, man, and, woman, as, well, as, a, man, in, his, early, twenties, through, examination, the, woman, was, discovered, to, be, around, 50, 60, years, old, she, was, found, with, several, artifacts, made, of, bronze, consisting, of, buttons, a, belt, plate, and, rings, showing, she, was, of, higher, class, all, of, the, hair, had, been, removed, from, the, skull, later, when, farmers, had, dug, through, the, casket, her, original, hairstyle, is, unknown, the, two, men, wore, kilts, and, the, younger, man, wore, a, sheath, which, contained, a, bronze, dagger, all, three, mummies, were, dated, to, 1351, 1345, bc, the, skrydstrup, woman, was, unearthed, from, a, tumulus, in, southern, jutland, in, 1935, carbon, 14, dating, showed, that, she, had, died, around, 1300, bc, examination, also, revealed, that, she, was, around, 18, 19, years, old, at, the, time, of, death, and, that, she, had, been, buried, in, the, summertime, her, hair, had, been, drawn, up, in, an, elaborate, hairstyle, which, was, then, covered, by, a, horse, hair, hairnet, made, by, the, sprang, technique, she, was, wearing, a, blouse, and, a, necklace, as, well, as, two, golden, earrings, showing, she, was, of, higher, class, the, egtved, girl, dated, to, 1370, bc, was, also, found, inside, a, sealed, coffin, within, a, tumulus, in, 1921, she, was, wearing, a, bodice, and, a, skirt, including, a, belt, and, bronze, bracelets, found, with, the, girl, at, her, feet, were, the, cremated, remains, of, a, child, and, by, her, head, a, box, containing, some, bronze, pins, a, hairnet, and, an, awl, in, 1994, 265, mummified, bodies, were, found, in, the, crypt, of, a, dominican, church, in, v, c, hungary, from, the, 1729, 1838, period, the, discovery, proved, to, be, scientifically, important, and, by, 2006, an, exhibition, was, established, in, the, museum, of, natural, history, in, budapest, unique, to, the, hungarian, mummies, are, their, elaborately, decorated, coffins, with, no, two, being, exactly, alike, the, varied, geography, and, climatology, of, italy, has, led, to, many, cases, of, spontaneous, mummification, italian, mummies, display, the, same, diversity, with, a, conglomeration, of, natural, and, intentional, mummification, spread, across, many, centuries, and, cultures, the, oldest, natural, mummy, in, europe, was, discovered, in, 1991, in, the, tztal, alps, on, the, austrian, italian, border, nicknamed, tzi, the, mummy, is, a, 5, 300, year, old, male, believed, to, be, a, member, of, the, tamins, carasso, isera, cultural, group, of, south, tyrol, despite, his, age, a, recent, dna, study, conducted, by, walther, parson, of, innsbruck, medical, university, revealed, tzi, has, 19, living, genetic, relatives, the, capuchin, catacombs, of, palermo, were, built, in, the, 16th, century, by, the, friars, of, palermo, s, capuchin, monastery, originally, intended, to, hold, the, deliberately, mummified, remains, of, dead, friars, interment, in, the, catacombs, became, a, status, symbol, for, the, local, population, in, the, following, centuries, burials, continued, until, the, 1920s, with, one, of, the, final, burials, being, that, of, rosalia, lombardo, in, all, the, catacombs, host, nearly, 8000, mummies, the, most, recent, discovery, of, mummies, in, italy, came, in, 2010, when, sixty, mummified, human, remains, were, found, in, the, crypt, of, the, conversion, of, st, paul, church, in, roccapelago, di, pievepelago, italy, built, in, the, 15th, century, as, a, cannon, hold, and, later, converted, in, the, 16th, century, the, crypt, had, been, sealed, once, it, had, reached, capacity, leaving, the, bodies, to, be, protected, and, preserved, the, crypt, was, reopened, during, restoration, work, on, the, church, revealing, the, diverse, array, of, mummies, inside, the, bodies, were, quickly, moved, to, a, museum, for, further, study, the, mummies, of, north, america, are, often, steeped, in, controversy, as, many, of, these, bodies, have, been, linked, to, still, existing, native, cultures, while, the, mummies, provide, a, wealth, of, historically, significant, data, native, cultures, and, tradition, often, demands, the, remains, be, returned, to, their, original, resting, places, this, has, led, to, many, legal, actions, by, native, american, councils, leading, to, most, museums, keeping, mummified, remains, out, of, the, public, eye, kw, day, d, n, ts, nchi, long, ago, person, found, in, the, southern, tutchone, language, of, the, champagne, and, aishihik, first, nations, was, found, in, august, 1999, by, three, first, nations, hunters, at, the, edge, of, a, glacier, in, tatshenshini, alsek, provincial, park, british, columbia, canada, according, to, the, kw, day, d, n, ts, nchi, project, the, remains, are, the, oldest, well, preserved, mummy, discovered, in, north, america, the, spirit, cave, mummy, although, not, well, preserved, is, much, older, initial, radiocarbon, tests, date, the, mummy, to, around, 550, years, old, in, 1972, eight, remarkably, preserved, mummies, were, discovered, at, an, abandoned, inuit, settlement, called, qilakitsoq, in, greenland, the, greenland, mummies, consisted, of, a, six, month, old, baby, a, four, year, old, boy, and, six, women, of, various, ages, who, died, around, 500, years, ago, their, bodies, were, naturally, mummified, by, the, sub, zero, temperatures, and, dry, winds, in, the, cave, in, which, they, were, found, intentional, mummification, in, pre, columbian, mexico, was, practiced, by, the, aztec, culture, these, bodies, are, collectively, known, as, aztec, mummies, genuine, aztec, mummies, were, bundled, in, a, woven, wrap, and, often, had, their, faces, covered, by, a, ceremonial, mask, public, knowledge, of, aztec, mummies, increased, due, to, traveling, exhibits, and, museums, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, though, these, bodies, were, typically, naturally, desiccated, remains, and, not, actually, the, mummies, associated, with, aztec, culture, natural, mummification, has, been, known, to, occur, in, several, places, in, mexico, this, includes, the, mummies, of, guanajuato, a, collection, of, these, mummies, most, of, which, date, to, the, late, 19th, century, have, been, on, display, at, el, museo, de, las, momias, in, the, city, of, guanajuato, since, 1970, the, museum, claims, to, have, the, smallest, mummy, in, the, world, on, display, a, mummified, fetus, it, was, thought, that, minerals, in, the, soil, had, the, preserving, effect, however, it, may, rather, be, due, to, the, warm, arid, climate, mexican, mummies, are, also, on, display, in, the, small, town, of, encarnaci, n, de, d, az, jalisco, spirit, cave, man, was, discovered, in, 1940, during, salvage, work, prior, to, guano, mining, activity, that, was, scheduled, to, begin, in, the, area, the, mummy, is, a, middle, aged, male, found, completely, dressed, and, lying, on, a, blanket, made, of, animal, skin, radiocarbon, tests, in, the, 1990s, dated, the, mummy, to, being, nearly, 9, 000, years, old, the, remains, were, held, at, the, nevada, state, museum, though, the, local, native, american, community, began, petitioning, to, have, the, remains, returned, and, reburied, in, 1995, when, the, bureau, of, land, management, did, not, repatriate, the, mummy, in, 2000, the, fallon, paiute, shoshone, tribe, sued, under, the, native, american, graves, protection, and, repatriation, act, after, dna, sequencing, determined, that, the, remains, were, in, fact, related, to, modern, native, americans, they, were, repatriated, to, the, tribe, in, 2016, mummies, from, oceania, are, not, limited, only, to, australia, discoveries, of, mummified, remains, have, also, been, located, in, new, zealand, and, the, torres, strait, though, these, mummies, have, been, historically, harder, to, examine, and, classify, prior, to, the, 20th, century, most, literature, on, mummification, in, the, region, was, either, silent, or, anecdotal, however, the, boom, of, interest, generated, by, the, scientific, study, of, egyptian, mummification, lead, to, more, concentrated, study, of, mummies, in, other, cultures, including, those, of, oceania, the, aboriginal, mummification, traditions, found, in, australia, are, thought, be, related, to, those, found, in, the, torres, strait, islands, the, inhabitants, of, which, achieved, a, high, level, of, sophisticated, mummification, techniques, australian, mummies, lack, some, of, the, technical, ability, of, the, torres, strait, mummies, however, much, of, the, ritual, aspects, of, the, mummification, process, are, similar, full, body, mummification, was, achieved, by, these, cultures, but, not, the, level, of, artistic, preservation, as, found, on, smaller, islands, the, reason, for, this, seems, to, be, for, easier, transport, of, bodies, by, more, nomadic, tribes, the, mummies, of, the, torres, strait, have, a, considerably, higher, level, of, preservation, technique, as, well, as, creativity, compared, to, those, found, on, australia, the, process, began, with, removal, of, viscera, after, which, the, bodies, were, set, in, a, seated, position, on, a, platform, and, either, left, to, dry, in, the, sun, or, smoked, over, a, fire, in, order, to, aid, in, desiccation, in, the, case, of, smoking, some, tribes, would, collect, the, fat, that, drained, from, the, body, to, mix, with, ocher, to, create, red, paint, that, would, then, be, smeared, back, on, the, skin, of, the, mummy, the, mummies, remained, on, the, platforms, decorated, with, the, clothing, and, jewelry, they, wore, in, life, before, being, buried, some, m, ori, tribes, from, new, zealand, would, keep, mummified, heads, as, trophies, from, tribal, warfare, they, are, also, known, as, mokomokai, in, the, 19th, century, many, of, the, trophies, were, acquired, by, europeans, who, found, the, tattooed, skin, to, be, a, phenomenal, curiosity, westerners, began, to, offer, valuable, commodities, in, exchange, for, the, uniquely, tattooed, mummified, heads, the, heads, were, later, put, on, display, in, museums, 16, of, them, in, france, alone, in, 2010, the, rouen, city, hall, of, france, returned, one, of, the, heads, to, new, zealand, despite, earlier, protests, by, the, culture, ministry, of, france, there, is, also, evidence, that, some, m, ori, tribes, may, have, practiced, full, body, mummification, though, the, practice, is, not, thought, to, have, been, widespread, the, discussion, of, m, ori, mummification, has, been, historically, controversial, with, some, experts, in, past, decades, claiming, that, such, mummies, have, never, existed, the, historical, significance, of, full, body, mummification, within, m, ori, culture, is, acknowledged, by, science, although, there, is, still, debate, as, to, the, nature, of, their, exact, mummification, processes, some, mummies, appear, to, have, been, spontaneously, created, by, the, natural, environment, while, others, exhibit, signs, of, direct, human, involvement, generally, modern, consensus, tends, to, agree, that, there, could, have, been, a, mixture, of, both, types, of, mummification, similar, to, that, of, the, ancient, egyptian, culture, the, south, american, continent, contains, some, of, the, oldest, mummies, in, the, world, both, deliberate, and, accidental, the, bodies, were, preserved, by, the, best, agent, for, mummification, the, environment, the, pacific, coastal, desert, in, peru, and, chile, is, one, of, the, driest, areas, in, the, world, and, the, dryness, facilitated, mummification, rather, than, developing, elaborate, processes, such, as, later, dynasty, ancient, egyptians, the, early, south, americans, often, left, their, dead, in, naturally, dry, or, frozen, areas, though, some, did, perform, surgical, preparation, when, mummification, was, intentional, some, of, the, reasons, for, intentional, mummification, in, south, america, include, memorialization, immortalization, and, religious, offerings, a, large, number, of, mummified, bodies, have, been, found, in, pre, columbian, cemeteries, scattered, around, peru, the, bodies, had, often, been, wrapped, for, burial, in, finely, woven, textiles, the, chinchorro, mummies, are, the, oldest, intentionally, prepared, mummified, bodies, ever, found, beginning, in, 5th, millennium, bc, and, continuing, for, an, estimated, 3, 500, years, all, human, burials, within, the, chinchorro, culture, were, prepared, for, mummification, the, bodies, were, carefully, prepared, beginning, with, removal, of, the, internal, organs, and, skin, before, being, left, in, the, hot, dry, climate, of, the, atacama, desert, which, aided, in, desiccation, a, large, number, of, chinchorro, mummies, were, also, prepared, by, skilled, artisans, to, be, preserved, in, a, more, artistic, fashion, though, the, purpose, of, this, practice, is, widely, debated, several, naturally, preserved, unintentional, mummies, dating, from, the, incan, period, 1438, 1532, ad, have, been, found, in, the, colder, regions, of, argentina, chile, and, peru, these, are, collectively, known, as, ice, mummies, the, first, incan, ice, mummy, was, discovered, in, 1954, atop, el, plomo, peak, in, chile, after, an, eruption, of, the, nearby, volcano, sabancaya, melted, away, ice, that, covered, the, body, the, mummy, of, el, plomo, was, a, male, child, who, was, presumed, to, be, wealthy, due, to, his, well, fed, bodily, characteristics, he, was, considered, to, be, the, most, well, preserved, ice, mummy, in, the, world, until, the, discovery, of, mummy, juanita, in, 1995, mummy, juanita, was, discovered, near, the, summit, of, ampato, in, the, peruvian, section, of, the, andes, mountains, by, archaeologist, johan, reinhard, her, body, had, been, so, thoroughly, frozen, that, it, had, not, been, desiccated, much, of, her, skin, muscle, tissue, and, internal, organs, retained, their, original, structure, she, is, believed, to, be, a, ritual, sacrifice, due, to, the, close, proximity, of, her, body, to, the, incan, capital, of, cusco, as, well, as, the, fact, she, was, wearing, highly, intricate, clothing, to, indicate, her, special, social, status, several, incan, ceremonial, artifacts, and, temporary, shelters, uncovered, in, the, surrounding, area, seem, to, support, this, theory, more, evidence, that, the, inca, left, sacrificial, victims, to, die, in, the, elements, and, later, be, unintentionally, preserved, came, in, 1999, with, the, discovery, of, the, llullaillaco, mummies, on, the, border, of, argentina, and, chile, the, three, mummies, are, children, two, girls, and, one, boy, who, are, thought, to, be, sacrifices, associated, with, the, ancient, ritual, of, qhapaq, hucha, recent, biochemical, analysis, of, the, mummies, has, revealed, that, the, victims, had, consumed, increasing, quantities, of, alcohol, and, coca, possibly, in, the, form, of, chicha, in, the, months, leading, up, to, sacrifice, the, dominant, theory, for, the, drugging, reasons, that, alongside, ritual, uses, the, substances, probably, made, the, children, more, docile, chewed, coca, leaves, found, inside, the, eldest, child, s, mouth, upon, her, discovery, in, 1999, supports, this, theory, the, bodies, of, inca, emperors, and, wives, were, mummified, after, death, in, 1533, the, spanish, conquistadors, of, the, inca, empire, viewed, the, mummies, in, the, inca, capital, of, cuzco, the, mummies, were, displayed, often, in, lifelike, positions, in, the, palaces, of, the, deceased, emperors, and, had, a, retinue, of, servants, to, care, for, them, the, spanish, were, impressed, with, the, quality, of, the, mummification, which, involved, removal, of, the, organs, embalming, and, freeze, drying, the, population, revered, the, mummies, of, the, inca, emperors, this, reverence, seemed, idolatry, to, the, roman, catholic, spanish, and, in, 1550, they, confiscated, the, mummies, the, mummies, were, taken, to, lima, where, they, were, displayed, in, the, san, andres, hospital, the, mummies, deteriorated, in, the, humid, climate, of, lima, and, eventually, they, were, either, buried, or, destroyed, by, the, spanish, an, attempt, to, find, the, mummies, of, the, inca, emperors, beneath, the, san, andres, hospital, in, 2001, was, unsuccessful, the, archaeologists, found, a, crypt, but, it, was, empty, possibly, the, mummies, had, been, removed, when, the, building, was, repaired, after, an, earthquake, monks, whose, bodies, remain, incorrupt, without, any, traces, of, deliberate, mummification, are, venerated, by, some, buddhists, who, believe, they, successfully, were, able, to, mortify, their, flesh, to, death, self, mummification, was, practiced, until, the, late, 1800s, in, japan, and, has, been, outlawed, since, the, early, 1900s, many, mahayana, buddhist, monks, were, reported, to, know, their, time, of, death, and, left, their, last, testaments, and, their, students, accordingly, buried, them, sitting, in, lotus, position, put, into, a, vessel, with, drying, agents, such, as, wood, paper, or, lime, and, surrounded, by, bricks, to, be, exhumed, later, usually, after, three, years, the, preserved, bodies, would, then, be, decorated, with, paint, and, adorned, with, gold, bodies, purported, to, be, those, of, self, mummified, monks, are, exhibited, in, several, japanese, shrines, and, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, monks, prior, to, their, death, stuck, to, a, sparse, diet, made, up, of, salt, nuts, seeds, roots, pine, bark, and, urushi, tea, in, the, 1830s, jeremy, bentham, the, founder, of, utilitarianism, left, instructions, to, be, followed, upon, his, death, which, led, to, the, creation, of, a, sort, of, modern, day, mummy, he, asked, that, his, body, be, displayed, to, illustrate, how, the, horror, at, dissection, originates, in, ignorance, once, so, displayed, and, lectured, about, he, asked, that, his, body, parts, be, preserved, including, his, skeleton, minus, his, skull, which, despite, being, mis, preserved, was, displayed, beneath, his, feet, until, theft, required, it, to, be, stored, elsewhere, which, were, to, be, dressed, in, the, clothes, he, usually, wore, and, seated, in, a, chair, usually, occupied, by, me, when, living, in, the, attitude, in,

dead, people, the, idea, was, so, popular, that, after, vladimir, lenin, s, death, leonid, krasin, and, alexander, bogdanov, suggested, to, cryonically, preserve, his, body, and, brain, in, order, to, revive, him, in, the, future, necessary, equipment, was, purchased, abroad, but, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, plan, was, not, realized, instead, his, body, was, embalmed, and, placed, on, permanent, exhibition, in, the, lenin, mausoleum, in, moscow, where, it, is, displayed, to, this, day, the, mausoleum, itself, was, modeled, by, alexey, shchusev, on, the, pyramid, of, djoser, and, the, tomb, of, cyrus, in, late, 19th, century, venezuela, a, german, born, doctor, named, gottfried, knoche, conducted, experiments, in, mummification, at, his, laboratory, in, the, forest, near, la, guaira, he, developed, an, embalming, fluid, based, on, an, aluminum, chloride, compound, that, mummified, corpses, without, having, to, remove, the, internal, organs, the, formula, for, his, fluid, was, never, revealed, and, has, not, been, discovered, most, of, the, several, dozen, mummies, created, with, the, fluid, including, himself, and, his, immediate, family, have, been, lost, or, were, severely, damaged, by, vandals, and, looters, in, 1975, an, esoteric, organization, by, the, name, of, summum, introduced, modern, mummification, a, service, that, utilizes, modern, techniques, along, with, aspects, of, ancient, methods, of, mummification, the, first, person, to, formally, undergo, summum, s, process, of, modern, mummification, was, the, founder, of, summum, summum, bonum, amen, ra, who, died, in, january, 2008, summum, is, currently, considered, to, be, the, only, commercial, mummification, business, in, the, world, in, 2010, a, team, led, by, forensic, archaeologist, stephen, buckley, mummified, alan, billis, using, techniques, based, on, 19, years, of, research, of, 18th, dynasty, egyptian, mummification, the, process, was, filmed, for, television, for, the, documentary, mummifying, alan, egypt, s, last, secret, billis, made, the, decision, to, allow, his, body, to, be, mummified, after, being, diagnosed, with, terminal, cancer, in, 2009, his, body, currently, resides, at, london, s, gordon, museum, am, lie, of, leuchtenberg, 1812, 1873, was, empress, of, brazil, as, the, wife, of, emperor, pedro, i, also, king, of, portugal, as, pedro, iv, between, february, and, september, 2012, researchers, at, the, university, of, s, o, paulo, in, brazil, exhumed, her, remains, as, well, as, those, of, her, husband, and, his, first, wife, maria, leopoldina, they, were, surprised, to, find, that, the, body, of, am, lie, had, been, mummified, skin, hair, and, internal, organs, were, preserved, examinations, at, the, hospital, das, cl, nicas, found, an, incision, in, the, empress, jugular, vein, aromatics, such, as, camphor, and, myrrh, were, injected, into, the, incision, during, the, embalming, process, it, certainly, helped, to, nullify, the, decomposition, said, brazilian, forensic, archaeologist, valdirene, ambiel, responsible, for, the, research, she, added, that, another, contributing, factor, was, the, casket, saying, it, was, so, hermetically, sealed, that, there, were, no, micro, organisms, in, it, before, the, reburial, scientists, reembalmed, am, lie, s, mummified, body, using, a, method, similar, to, the, first, one, the, remains, of, am, lie, pedro, i, and, maria, leopoldina, are, interred, in, the, monument, to, the, independence, of, brazil, in, s, o, paulo, plastination, is, a, technique, used, in, anatomy, to, conserve, bodies, or, body, parts, the, water, and, fat, are, replaced, by, certain, plastics, yielding, specimens, that, can, be, touched, do, not, smell, or, decay, and, even, retain, most, microscopic, properties, of, the, original, sample, the, technique, was, invented, by, gunther, von, hagens, when, working, at, the, anatomical, institute, of, the, heidelberg, university, in, 1978, von, hagens, has, patented, the, technique, in, several, countries, and, is, heavily, involved, in, its, promotion, especially, as, the, creator, and, director, of, the, body, worlds, traveling, exhibitions, exhibiting, plastinated, human, bodies, internationally, he, also, founded, and, directs, the, institute, for, plastination, in, heidelberg, more, than, 40, institutions, worldwide, have, facilities, for, plastination, mainly, for, medical, research, and, study, and, most, affiliated, to, the, international, society, for, plastination, in, the, middle, ages, based, on, a, mistranslation, from, the, arabic, term, for, bitumen, it, was, thought, that, mummies, possessed, healing, properties, as, a, result, it, became, common, practice, to, grind, egyptian, mummies, into, a, powder, to, be, sold, and, used, as, medicine, when, actual, mummies, became, unavailable, the, sun, desiccated, corpses, of, criminals, slaves, and, suicidal, people, were, substituted, by, mendacious, merchants, francis, bacon, and, robert, boyle, recommended, them, for, healing, bruises, and, preventing, bleeding, the, trade, in, mummies, seems, to, have, been, frowned, upon, by, turkish, authorities, who, ruled, egypt, several, egyptians, were, imprisoned, for, boiling, mummies, to, make, oil, in, 1424, however, mummies, were, in, high, demand, in, europe, and, it, was, possible, to, buy, them, for, the, right, amount, of, money, john, snaderson, an, english, tradesman, who, visited, egypt, in, the, 16th, century, shipped, six, hundred, pounds, of, mummy, back, to, england, the, practice, developed, into, a, wide, scale, business, that, flourished, until, the, late, 16th, century, two, centuries, ago, mummies, were, still, believed, to, have, medicinal, properties, to, stop, bleeding, and, were, sold, as, pharmaceuticals, in, powdered, form, as, in, mellified, man, artists, also, made, use, of, egyptian, mummies, a, brownish, pigment, known, as, mummy, brown, based, on, mummia, sometimes, called, alternatively, caput, mortuum, latin, for, death, s, head, which, was, originally, obtained, by, grinding, human, and, animal, egyptian, mummies, it, was, most, popular, in, the, 17th, century, but, was, discontinued, in, the, early, 19th, century, when, its, composition, became, generally, known, to, artists, who, replaced, the, said, pigment, by, a, totally, different, blend, but, keeping, the, original, name, mummia, or, mummy, brown, yielding, a, similar, tint, and, based, on, ground, minerals, oxides, and, fired, earths, and, or, blends, of, powdered, gums, and, oleoresins, such, as, myrrh, and, frankincense, as, well, as, ground, bitumen, these, blends, appeared, on, the, market, as, forgeries, of, powdered, mummy, pigment, but, were, ultimately, considered, as, acceptable, replacements, once, antique, mummies, were, no, longer, permitted, to, be, destroyed, many, thousands, of, mummified, cats, were, also, sent, from, egypt, to, england, to, be, processed, for, use, in, fertilizer, during, the, 19th, century, following, the, discovery, of, the, first, tombs, and, artifacts, in, egypt, egyptology, was, a, huge, fad, in, europe, especially, in, victorian, england, european, aristocrats, would, occasionally, entertain, themselves, by, purchasing, mummies, having, them, unwrapped, and, holding, observation, sessions, the, pioneer, of, this, kind, of, entertainment, in, britain, was, thomas, pettigrew, known, as, mummy, pettigrew, due, to, his, work, such, unrolling, sessions, destroyed, hundreds, of, mummies, because, the, exposure, to, the, air, caused, them, to, disintegrate, the, use, of, mummies, as, fuel, for, locomotives, was, documented, by, mark, twain, likely, as, a, joke, or, humor, but, the, truth, of, the, story, remains, debatable, during, the, american, civil, war, mummy, wrapping, linens, were, said, to, have, been, used, to, manufacture, paper, evidence, for, the, reality, of, these, claims, is, still, equivocal, researcher, ben, radford, reports, that, in, her, book, the, mummy, congress, heather, pringle, writes, no, mummy, expert, has, ever, been, able, to, authenticate, the, story, twain, seems, to, be, the, only, published, source, and, a, rather, suspect, one, at, that, pringle, also, writes, that, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, mummy, paper, either, radford, also, says, that, many, journalists, have, not, done, a, good, job, with, their, research, and, while, it, is, true, that, mummies, were, often, not, shown, respect, in, the, 1800s, there, is, no, evidence, for, this, rumor, while, mummies, were, used, in, medicine, some, researchers, have, brought, into, question, these, other, uses, such, as, making, paper, and, paint, fueling, locomotives, and, fertilizing, land, a, 2023, report, by, cnn, revealed, that, a, number, of, museums, in, britain, were, rethinking, how, they, described, their, displays, of, ancient, egyptian, human, remains, known, as, mummies, in, order, to, emphasize, that, these, individuals, were, once, living, people, the, museums, started, using, terms, such, as, mummified, person, or, the, individual, s, name, instead, of, mummy, the, shift, in, language, was, also, intended, to, distance, the, display, of, mummies, from, their, depiction, in, popular, culture, which, often, undermined, their, humanity, by, depicting, them, as, supernatural, monsters, and, perpetuating, the, notion, of, a, mummy, s, curse, the, change, in, language, is, part, of, a, larger, effort, by, museums, to, address, historical, bias, and, reflect, on, the, way, they, represent, the, past, to, audiences, the, british, museum, for, example, has, not, banned, the, use, of, the, term, mummy, in, its, displays, but, has, started, to, use, alternative, terminology, such, as, mummified, remains, and, including, the, individual, s, name, when, known
