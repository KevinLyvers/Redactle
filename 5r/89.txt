reportedly, haunted, locations, parapsychology, is, the, study, of, alleged, psychic, phenomena, extrasensory, perception, telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, also, called, telekinesis, and, psychometry, and, other, paranormal, claims, for, example, those, related, to, near, death, experiences, synchronicity, apparitional, experiences, etc, criticized, as, being, a, pseudoscience, the, majority, of, mainstream, scientists, reject, it, parapsychology, has, also, been, criticized, by, mainstream, critics, for, claims, by, many, of, its, practitioners, that, their, studies, are, plausible, despite, a, lack, of, convincing, evidence, after, more, than, a, century, of, research, for, the, existence, of, any, psychic, phenomena, parapsychology, research, rarely, appears, in, mainstream, scientific, journals, a, few, niche, journals, publish, most, papers, about, parapsychology, the, term, parapsychology, was, coined, in, 1889, by, philosopher, max, dessoir, as, the, german, parapsychologie, it, was, adopted, by, j, b, rhine, in, the, 1930s, as, a, replacement, for, the, term, psychical, research, to, indicate, a, significant, shift, toward, experimental, methodology, and, academic, discipline, the, term, originates, from, the, greek, para, meaning, alongside, and, psychology, in, parapsychology, psi, is, the, unknown, factor, in, extrasensory, perception, and, psychokinesis, experiences, that, is, not, explained, by, known, physical, or, biological, mechanisms, the, term, is, derived, from, psi, the, 23rd, letter, of, the, greek, alphabet, and, the, initial, letter, of, the, greek, psyche, mind, soul, the, term, was, coined, by, biologist, bertold, wiesner, and, first, used, by, psychologist, robert, thouless, in, a, 1942, article, published, in, the, british, journal, of, psychology, the, parapsychological, association, divides, psi, into, two, main, categories, psi, gamma, for, extrasensory, perception, and, psi, kappa, for, psychokinesis, in, popular, culture, psi, has, become, more, and, more, synonymous, with, extraordinary, psychic, mental, and, psionic, abilities, and, powers, in, 1853, chemist, robert, hare, conducted, experiments, with, mediums, and, reported, positive, results, other, researchers, such, as, frank, podmore, highlighted, flaws, in, his, experiments, such, as, lack, of, controls, to, prevent, trickery, agenor, de, gasparin, conducted, early, experiments, into, table, tipping, for, five, months, in, 1853, he, declared, the, experiments, a, success, being, the, result, of, an, ectenic, force, critics, noted, that, the, conditions, were, insufficient, to, prevent, trickery, for, example, the, sitters, may, have, moved, the, table, with, their, knees, and, no, experimenter, was, simultaneously, watching, above, and, below, the, table, the, german, astrophysicist, johann, karl, friedrich, z, llner, tested, the, medium, henry, slade, in, 1877, according, to, z, llner, some, of, the, experiments, were, successful, however, flaws, in, the, experiments, were, discovered, and, critics, have, suggested, that, slade, was, a, fraud, who, performed, trickery, in, the, experiments, the, society, for, psychical, research, spr, was, founded, in, london, in, 1882, its, formation, was, the, first, systematic, effort, to, organize, scientists, and, scholars, to, investigate, paranormal, phenomena, early, membership, included, philosophers, scholars, scientists, educators, and, politicians, such, as, henry, sidgwick, arthur, balfour, william, crookes, rufus, osgood, mason, and, nobel, laureate, charles, richet, presidents, of, the, society, included, in, addition, to, richet, eleanor, sidgwick, and, william, james, and, subsequently, nobel, laureates, henri, bergson, and, lord, rayleigh, and, philosopher, c, d, broad, areas, of, study, included, telepathy, hypnotism, reichenbach, s, phenomena, apparitions, hauntings, and, the, physical, aspects, of, spiritualism, such, as, table, tilting, materialization, and, apportation, in, the, 1880s, the, society, investigated, apparitional, experiences, and, hallucinations, in, the, sane, among, the, first, important, works, was, the, two, volume, publication, in, 1886, phantasms, of, the, living, which, was, largely, criticized, by, scholars, in, 1894, the, census, of, hallucinations, was, published, which, sampled, 17, 000, people, out, of, these, 1, 684, persons, admitted, to, having, experienced, a, hallucination, of, an, apparition, the, spr, became, the, model, for, similar, societies, in, other, european, countries, and, the, united, states, during, the, late, 19th, century, early, clairvoyance, experiments, were, reported, in, 1884, by, charles, richet, playing, cards, were, enclosed, in, envelopes, and, a, subject, was, put, under, hypnosis, to, identify, them, the, subject, was, reported, to, have, succeeded, in, a, series, of, 133, trials, but, the, results, dropped, to, the, chance, level, when, performed, before, a, group, of, scientists, in, cambridge, j, m, peirce, and, e, c, pickering, reported, a, similar, experiment, in, which, they, tested, 36, subjects, over, 23, 384, trials, which, did, not, obtain, above, chance, scores, in, 1881, eleanor, sidgwick, revealed, the, fraudulent, methods, that, spirit, photographers, such, as, douard, isidore, buguet, frederic, hudson, and, william, h, mumler, had, utilized, during, the, late, nineteenth, century, many, fraudulent, mediums, were, exposed, by, spr, investigators, largely, due, to, the, support, of, psychologist, william, james, the, american, society, for, psychical, research, aspr, opened, its, doors, in, boston, in, 1885, moving, to, new, york, city, in, 1905, under, the, leadership, of, james, h, hyslop, notable, cases, investigated, by, walter, franklin, prince, of, the, aspr, in, the, early, 20th, century, included, pierre, l, o, a, keeler, the, great, amherst, mystery, and, patience, worth, in, 1911, stanford, university, became, the, first, academic, institution, in, the, united, states, to, study, extrasensory, perception, esp, and, psychokinesis, pk, in, a, laboratory, setting, the, effort, was, headed, by, psychologist, john, edgar, coover, and, funded, by, thomas, welton, stanford, brother, of, the, university, s, founder, after, conducting, approximately, 10, 000, experiments, coover, concluded, that, statistical, treatments, of, the, data, fail, to, reveal, any, cause, beyond, chance, in, 1930, duke, university, became, the, second, major, u, s, academic, institution, to, engage, in, the, critical, study, of, esp, and, psychokinesis, in, the, laboratory, under, the, guidance, of, psychologist, william, mcdougall, and, with, the, help, of, others, in, the, department, including, psychologists, karl, zener, joseph, b, rhine, and, louisa, e, rhine, laboratory, esp, experiments, using, volunteer, subjects, from, the, undergraduate, student, body, began, as, opposed, to, the, approaches, of, psychical, research, which, generally, sought, qualitative, evidence, for, paranormal, phenomena, the, experiments, at, duke, university, proffered, a, quantitative, statistical, approach, using, cards, and, dice, as, a, consequence, of, the, esp, experiments, at, duke, standard, laboratory, procedures, for, the, testing, of, esp, were, developed, and, adopted, by, interested, researchers, worldwide, george, estabrooks, conducted, an, esp, experiment, using, cards, in, 1927, harvard, students, were, used, as, the, subjects, estabrooks, acted, as, the, sender, with, the, guesser, in, an, adjoining, room, estabrooks, conducted, a, total, of, 2, 300, trials, when, estabrooks, sent, the, subjects, to, a, distant, room, with, insulation, the, scores, dropped, to, chance, level, attempts, to, repeat, the, experiment, also, failed, the, publication, of, j, b, rhine, s, book, new, frontiers, of, the, mind, 1937, brought, the, laboratory, s, findings, to, the, general, public, in, his, book, rhine, popularized, the, word, parapsychology, coined, by, psychologist, max, dessoir, over, 40, years, earlier, to, describe, the, research, conducted, at, duke, rhine, also, founded, an, autonomous, parapsychology, laboratory, within, duke, and, started, the, journal, of, parapsychology, which, he, co, edited, with, mcdougall, rhine, along, with, associate, karl, zener, had, developed, a, statistical, system, of, testing, for, esp, that, involved, subjects, guessing, what, symbol, out, of, five, possible, symbols, would, appear, when, going, through, a, special, deck, of, cards, designed, for, this, purpose, a, percentage, of, correct, guesses, or, hits, significantly, above, 20, was, perceived, as, higher, than, chance, and, indicative, of, psychic, ability, rhine, stated, in, his, first, book, extrasensory, perception, 1934, that, after, 90, 000, trials, he, felt, esp, is, an, actual, and, demonstrable, occurrence, irish, medium, and, parapsychologist, eileen, j, garrett, was, tested, by, rhine, at, duke, university, in, 1933, with, zener, cards, rhine, placed, certain, symbols, on, the, cards, sealed, them, in, an, envelope, and, asked, garrett, to, guess, their, contents, she, performed, poorly, and, later, criticized, the, tests, by, claiming, the, cards, lacked, a, psychic, energy, called, energy, stimulus, and, that, she, could, not, perform, clairvoyance, to, order, the, parapsychologist, samuel, soal, and, his, colleagues, tested, garrett, in, may, 1937, soal, conducted, most, experiments, in, the, psychological, laboratory, at, university, college, london, soal, recorded, over, 12, 000, guesses, but, garrett, failed, to, produce, above, chance, level, in, his, report, soal, wrote, in, the, case, of, mrs, eileen, garrett, we, fail, to, find, the, slightest, confirmation, of, j, b, rhine, s, remarkable, claims, relating, to, her, alleged, powers, of, extra, sensory, perception, not, only, did, she, fail, when, i, took, charge, of, the, experiments, but, she, failed, equally, when, four, other, carefully, trained, experimenters, took, my, place, the, parapsychology, experiments, at, duke, evoked, much, criticism, from, academics, and, others, who, challenged, the, concepts, and, evidence, of, esp, many, psychological, departments, attempted, to, repeat, rhine, s, experiments, with, failure, w, s, cox, 1936, from, princeton, university, with, 132, subjects, produced, 25, 064, trials, in, a, playing, card, esp, experiment, cox, concluded, there, is, no, evidence, of, extrasensory, perception, either, in, the, average, man, or, of, the, group, investigated, or, in, any, particular, individual, of, that, group, the, discrepancy, between, these, results, and, those, obtained, by, rhine, is, due, either, to, uncontrollable, factors, in, experimental, procedure, or, to, the, difference, in, the, subjects, four, other, psychological, departments, failed, to, replicate, rhine, s, results, after, thousands, of, card, runs, james, charles, crumbaugh, failed, to, duplicate, the, results, of, rhine, in, 1938, the, psychologist, joseph, jastrow, wrote, that, much, of, the, evidence, for, extrasensory, perception, collected, by, rhine, and, other, parapsychologists, was, anecdotal, biased, dubious, and, the, result, of, faulty, observation, and, familiar, human, frailties, rhine, s, experiments, were, discredited, due, to, the, discovery, that, sensory, leakage, or, cheating, could, account, for, all, his, results, such, as, the, subject, being, able, to, read, the, symbols, from, the, back, of, the, cards, and, being, able, to, see, and, hear, the, experimenter, to, note, subtle, clues, illusionist, milbourne, christopher, wrote, years, later, that, he, felt, there, are, at, least, a, dozen, ways, a, subject, who, wished, to, cheat, under, the, conditions, rhine, described, could, deceive, the, investigator, when, rhine, took, precautions, in, response, to, criticisms, of, his, methods, he, failed, to, find, any, high, scoring, subjects, another, criticism, made, by, chemist, irving, langmuir, among, others, was, one, of, selective, reporting, langmuir, stated, that, rhine, did, not, report, scores, of, subjects, that, he, suspected, were, intentionally, guessing, wrong, and, that, this, he, felt, biased, the, statistical, results, higher, than, they, should, have, been, rhine, and, his, colleagues, attempted, to, address, these, criticisms, through, new, experiments, described, in, the, book, extrasensory, perception, after, sixty, years, 1940, rhine, described, three, experiments, the, pearce, pratt, experiment, the, pratt, woodruff, experiment, and, the, ownbey, zirkle, series, which, he, believed, demonstrated, esp, however, c, e, m, hansel, wrote, it, is, now, known, that, each, experiment, contained, serious, flaws, that, escaped, notice, in, the, examination, made, by, the, authors, of, extra, sensory, perception, after, sixty, years, joseph, gaither, pratt, was, the, co, experimenter, in, the, pearce, pratt, and, pratt, woodruff, experiments, at, the, duke, campus, hansel, visited, the, campus, where, the, experiments, took, place, and, discovered, the, results, could, have, originated, through, a, trick, so, they, could, not, supply, evidence, for, esp, in, 1957, rhine, and, joseph, gaither, pratt, wrote, parapsychology, frontier, science, of, the, mind, because, of, the, methodological, problems, parapsychologists, no, longer, utilize, card, guessing, studies, rhine, s, experiments, into, psychokinesis, pk, were, also, criticized, john, sladek, wrote, his, research, used, dice, with, subjects, willing, them, to, fall, a, certain, way, not, only, can, dice, be, drilled, shaved, falsely, numbered, and, manipulated, but, even, straight, dice, often, show, bias, in, the, long, run, casinos, for, this, reason, retire, dice, often, but, at, duke, subjects, continued, to, try, for, the, same, effect, on, the, same, dice, over, long, experimental, runs, not, surprisingly, pk, appeared, at, duke, and, nowhere, else, parapsychologists, and, skeptics, criticized, the, ownbey, zirkle, esp, experiment, at, duke, ownbey, would, attempt, to, send, esp, symbols, to, zirkle, who, would, guess, what, they, were, the, pair, were, placed, in, adjacent, rooms, unable, to, see, each, other, and, an, electric, fan, was, used, to, prevent, the, pair, from, communicating, by, sensory, cues, ownbey, tapped, a, telegraph, key, to, zirkle, to, inform, him, when, she, was, trying, to, send, him, a, symbol, the, door, separating, the, two, rooms, was, open, during, the, experiment, and, after, each, guess, zirkle, would, call, out, his, guess, to, ownbey, who, recorded, his, choice, critics, pointed, out, the, experiment, was, flawed, as, ownbey, acted, as, both, the, sender, and, the, experimenter, nobody, controlled, the, experiment, so, ownbey, could, have, cheated, by, communicating, with, zirkle, or, made, recording, mistakes, the, turner, ownbey, long, distance, telepathy, experiment, was, also, flawed, may, frances, turner, positioned, herself, in, the, duke, parapsychology, laboratory, while, sara, ownbey, claimed, to, receive, transmissions, 250, miles, away, for, the, experiment, turner, would, think, of, a, symbol, and, write, it, down, while, ownbey, would, write, her, guesses, the, scores, were, highly, successful, and, both, records, were, supposed, to, be, sent, to, j, b, rhine, however, ownbey, sent, them, to, turner, critics, pointed, out, this, invalidated, the, results, as, she, could, have, simply, written, her, own, record, to, agree, with, the, other, when, the, experiment, was, repeated, and, the, records, were, sent, to, rhine, the, scores, dropped, to, average, lucien, warner, and, mildred, raible, performed, a, famous, esp, experiment, at, duke, university, warner, and, raible, locked, a, subject, in, a, room, with, a, switch, controlling, a, signal, light, elsewhere, which, she, could, signal, to, guess, the, card, ten, runs, with, esp, packs, of, cards, were, used, and, she, achieved, 93, hits, 43, more, than, chance, weaknesses, with, the, experiment, were, later, discovered, the, duration, of, the, light, signal, could, be, varied, so, that, the, subject, could, call, for, specific, symbols, certain, symbols, in, the, experiment, appeared, far, more, often, than, others, indicating, poor, shuffling, or, card, manipulation, the, experiment, was, not, repeated, duke, s, administration, grew, less, sympathetic, to, parapsychology, and, after, rhine, s, retirement, in, 1965, parapsychological, links, with, the, university, were, broken, rhine, later, established, the, foundation, for, research, on, the, nature, of, man, frnm, and, the, institute, for, parapsychology, as, a, successor, to, the, duke, laboratory, in, 1995, the, centenary, of, rhine, s, birth, the, frnm, was, renamed, the, rhine, research, center, today, the, rhine, research, center, is, a, parapsychology, research, unit, stating, that, it, aims, to, improve, the, human, condition, by, creating, a, scientific, understanding, of, those, abilities, and, sensitivities, that, appear, to, transcend, the, ordinary, limits, of, space, and, time, the, parapsychological, association, pa, was, created, in, durham, north, carolina, on, june, 19, 1957, j, b, rhine, proposed, its, formation, at, a, parapsychology, workshop, held, at, the, parapsychology, laboratory, of, duke, university, rhine, proposed, that, the, group, form, itself, into, the, nucleus, of, an, international, professional, society, in, parapsychology, the, aim, of, the, organization, as, stated, in, its, constitution, became, to, advance, parapsychology, as, a, science, to, disseminate, knowledge, of, the, field, and, to, integrate, the, findings, with, those, of, other, branches, of, science, in, 1969, under, the, direction, of, anthropologist, margaret, mead, the, parapsychological, association, became, affiliated, with, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, aaas, the, largest, general, scientific, society, in, the, world, in, 1979, physicist, john, a, wheeler, said, that, parapsychology, is, pseudoscientific, and, that, the, affiliation, of, the, pa, to, the, aaas, needed, to, be, reconsidered, his, challenge, to, parapsychology, s, aaas, affiliation, was, unsuccessful, today, the, pa, consists, of, about, three, hundred, full, associate, and, affiliated, members, worldwide, beginning, in, the, early, 1950s, the, cia, started, extensive, research, into, behavioral, engineering, the, findings, from, these, experiments, led, to, the, formation, of, the, stargate, project, which, handled, esp, research, for, the, u, s, federal, government, the, stargate, project, was, terminated, in, 1995, with, the, conclusion, that, it, was, never, useful, in, any, intelligence, operation, the, information, was, vague, and, included, a, lot, of, irrelevant, and, erroneous, data, there, was, also, reason, to, suspect, that, the, research, managers, had, adjusted, their, project, reports, to, fit, the, known, background, cues, the, affiliation, of, the, parapsychological, association, pa, with, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, along, with, a, general, openness, to, psychic, and, occult, phenomena, in, the, 1970s, led, to, a, decade, of, increased, parapsychological, research, during, this, period, other, related, organizations, were, also, formed, including, the, academy, of, parapsychology, and, medicine, 1970, the, institute, of, parascience, 1971, the, academy, of, religion, and, psychical, research, the, institute, of, noetic, sciences, 1973, the, international, kirlian, research, association, 1975, and, the, princeton, engineering, anomalies, research, laboratory, 1979, parapsychological, work, was, also, conducted, at, the, stanford, research, institute, sri, during, this, time, the, scope, of, parapsychology, expanded, during, these, years, psychiatrist, ian, stevenson, conducted, much, of, his, research, into, reincarnation, during, the, 1970s, and, the, second, edition, of, his, twenty, cases, suggestive, of, reincarnation, was, published, in, 1974, psychologist, thelma, moss, studied, kirlian, photography, at, ucla, s, parapsychology, laboratory, the, influx, of, spiritual, teachers, from, asia, and, their, claims, of, abilities, produced, by, meditation, led, to, research, on, altered, states, of, consciousness, american, society, for, psychical, research, director, of, research, karlis, osis, conducted, experiments, in, out, of, body, experiences, physicist, russell, targ, coined, the, term, remote, viewing, for, use, in, some, of, his, work, at, sri, in, 1974, the, surge, in, paranormal, research, continued, into, the, 1980s, the, parapsychological, association, reported, members, working, in, more, than, 30, countries, for, example, research, was, carried, out, and, regular, conferences, held, in, eastern, europe, and, the, former, soviet, union, although, the, word, parapsychology, was, discarded, in, favor, of, the, term, psychotronics, the, main, promoter, of, psychotronics, was, czech, scientist, zden, k, rejd, k, who, described, it, as, a, physical, science, organizing, conferences, and, presiding, over, the, international, association, for, psychotronic, research, in, 1985, the, department, of, psychology, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, established, a, chair, of, parapsychology, awarding, it, to, robert, morris, an, experimental, parapsychologist, from, the, united, states, morris, and, his, research, associates, and, phd, students, pursued, research, on, topics, related, to, parapsychology, since, the, 1980s, contemporary, parapsychological, research, has, waned, considerably, in, the, united, states, early, research, was, considered, inconclusive, and, parapsychologists, faced, strong, skepticism, from, their, academic, colleagues, some, effects, thought, to, be, paranormal, for, example, the, effects, of, kirlian, photography, thought, by, some, to, represent, a, human, aura, disappeared, under, more, stringent, controls, leaving, those, avenues, of, research, at, dead, ends, most, parapsychology, research, in, the, us, is, now, confined, to, private, institutions, funded, by, private, sources, after, 28, years, of, research,

in, conventional, psychology, departments, and, do, studies, in, mainstream, psychology, to, boost, their, credibility, and, show, that, their, methods, are, sound, it, is, thought, that, this, approach, could, account, for, the, relative, strength, of, parapsychology, in, britain, as, of, 2007, parapsychology, was, researched, in, some, 30, countries, and, some, universities, worldwide,

noise, by, providing, mild, unpatterned, stimuli, to, the, visual, and, auditory, senses, the, visual, sense, is, usually, isolated, by, creating, a, soft, red, glow, which, is, diffused, through, half, ping, pong, balls, placed, over, the, recipient, s, eyes, the, auditory, sense, is, usually, blocked, by, playing, white, noise, static, or, similar, sounds, to, the, recipient, the, subject, is, also, seated, in, a, reclined, comfortable, position, to, minimize, the, sense, of, touch, in, the, typical, ganzfeld, experiment, a, sender, and, a, receiver, are, isolated, the, receiver, is, put, into, the, ganzfeld, state, or, ganzfeld, effect, and, the, sender, is, shown, a, video, clip, or, still, picture, and, asked, to, send, that, image, to, the, receiver, mentally, while, in, the, ganzfeld, experimenters, ask, the, receiver, to, continuously, speak, aloud, all, mental, processes, including, images, thoughts, and, feelings, at, the, end, of, the, sending, period, typically, about, 20, to, 40, minutes, the, receiver, is, taken, out, of, the, ganzfeld, state, and, shown, four, images, or, videos, one, of, which, is, the, actual, target, and, three, non, target, decoys, the, receiver, attempts, to, select, the, target, using, perceptions, experienced, during, the, ganzfeld, state, as, clues, to, what, the, mentally, sent, image, might, have, been, the, ganzfeld, experiment, studies, that, were, examined, by, ray, hyman, and, charles, honorton, had, methodological, problems, that, were, well, documented, honorton, reported, only, 36, of, the, studies, used, duplicate, target, sets, of, pictures, to, avoid, handling, cues, hyman, discovered, flaws, in, all, of, the, 42, ganzfeld, experiments, and, to, assess, each, experiment, he, devised, a, set, of, 12, categories, of, flaws, six, of, these, concerned, statistical, defects, and, the, other, six, covered, procedural, flaws, such, as, inadequate, documentation, randomization, security, and, possibilities, of, sensory, leakage, over, half, of, the, studies, failed, to, safeguard, against, sensory, leakage, and, all, of, the, studies, contained, at, least, one, of, the, 12, flaws, because, of, the, flaws, honorton, agreed, with, hyman, the, 42, ganzfeld, studies, could, not, support, the, claim, for, the, existence, of, psi, possibilities, of, sensory, leakage, in, the, ganzfeld, experiments, included, the, receivers, hearing, what, was, going, on, in, the, sender, s, room, next, door, as, the, rooms, were, not, soundproof, and, the, sender, s, fingerprints, to, be, visible, on, the, target, object, for, the, receiver, to, see, hyman, reviewed, the, autoganzfeld, experiments, and, discovered, a, pattern, in, the, data, that, implied, a, visual, cue, may, have, taken, place, hyman, wrote, the, autoganzfeld, experiments, were, flawed, because, they, did, not, preclude, the, possibility, of, sensory, leakage, in, 2010, lance, storm, patrizio, tressoldi, and, lorenzo, di, risio, analyzed, 29, ganzfeld, studies, from, 1997, to, 2008, of, the, 1, 498, trials, 483, produced, hits, corresponding, to, a, hit, rate, of, 32, 2, this, hit, rate, is, statistically, significant, with, p, 001, participants, selected, for, personality, traits, and, personal, characteristics, thought, to, be, psi, conducive, were, found, to, perform, significantly, better, than, unselected, participants, in, the, ganzfeld, condition, hyman, 2010, published, a, rebuttal, to, storm, et, al, according, to, hyman, reliance, on, meta, analysis, as, the, sole, basis, for, justifying, the, claim, that, an, anomaly, exists, and, that, the, evidence, for, it, is, consistent, and, replicable, is, fallacious, it, distorts, what, scientists, mean, by, confirmatory, evidence, hyman, wrote, that, the, ganzfeld, studies, were, not, independently, replicated, and, failed, to, produce, evidence, for, psi, storm, et, al, published, a, response, to, hyman, stating, that, the, ganzfeld, experimental, design, has, proved, to, be, consistent, and, reliable, that, parapsychology, is, a, struggling, discipline, that, has, not, received, much, attention, and, that, therefore, further, research, on, the, subject, is, necessary, rouder, et, al, 2013, wrote, that, critical, evaluation, of, storm, et, al, s, meta, analysis, reveals, no, evidence, for, psi, no, plausible, mechanism, and, omitted, replication, failures, remote, viewing, is, the, practice, of, seeking, impressions, about, a, distant, or, unseen, target, using, subjective, means, in, particular, extrasensory, perception, a, remote, viewer, is, typically, expected, to, give, information, about, an, object, event, person, or, location, hidden, from, physical, view, and, separated, at, some, distance, several, hundred, such, trials, have, been, conducted, by, investigators, over, the, past, 25, years, including, those, by, the, princeton, engineering, anomalies, research, laboratory, pear, and, by, scientists, at, sri, international, and, science, applications, international, corporation, many, of, these, were, under, contract, by, the, u, s, government, as, part, of, the, espionage, program, stargate, project, which, terminated, in, 1995, having, failed, to, document, any, practical, intelligence, value, the, psychologists, david, marks, and, richard, kammann, attempted, to, replicate, russell, targ, and, harold, puthoff, s, remote, viewing, experiments, that, were, carried, out, in, the, 1970s, at, sri, international, in, a, series, of, 35, studies, they, could, not, replicate, the, results, motivating, them, to, investigate, the, procedure, of, the, original, experiments, marks, and, kammann, discovered, that, the, notes, given, to, the, judges, in, targ, and, puthoff, s, experiments, contained, clues, as, to, the, order, in, which, they, were, carried, out, such, as, referring, to, yesterday, s, two, targets, or, having, the, session, date, written, at, the, top, of, the, page, they, concluded, that, these, clues, were, the, reason, for, the, experiment, s, high, hit, rates, marks, was, able, to, achieve, 100, percent, accuracy, without, visiting, any, of, the, sites, himself, but, by, using, cues, james, randi, wrote, controlled, tests, in, collaboration, with, several, other, researchers, eliminating, several, sources, of, cueing, and, extraneous, evidence, present, in, the, original, tests, randi, s, controlled, tests, produced, negative, results, students, could, also, solve, puthoff, and, targ, s, locations, from, the, cues, included, in, the, transcripts, in, 1980, charles, tart, claimed, that, rejudging, the, transcripts, from, one, of, targ, and, puthoff, s, experiments, revealed, an, above, chance, result, targ, and, puthoff, again, refused, to, provide, copies, of, the, transcripts, and, it, was, not, until, july, 1985, that, they, were, made, available, for, study, when, it, was, discovered, they, still, contained, sensory, cues, marks, and, christopher, scott, 1986, wrote, considering, the, importance, for, the, remote, viewing, hypothesis, of, adequate, cue, removal, tart, s, failure, to, perform, this, basic, task, seems, beyond, comprehension, as, previously, concluded, remote, viewing, has, not, been, demonstrated, in, the, experiments, conducted, by, puthoff, and, targ, only, the, repeated, failure, of, the, investigators, to, remove, sensory, cues, pear, closed, its, doors, at, the, end, of, february, 2007, its, founder, robert, g, jahn, said, of, it, for, 28, years, we, ve, done, what, we, wanted, to, do, and, there, s, no, reason, to, stay, and, generate, more, of, the, same, data, statistical, flaws, in, his, work, have, been, proposed, by, others, in, the, parapsychological, and, general, scientific, communities, the, physicist, robert, l, park, said, of, pear, it, s, been, an, embarrassment, to, science, and, i, think, an, embarrassment, for, princeton, the, advent, of, powerful, and, inexpensive, electronic, and, computer, technologies, has, allowed, the, development, of, fully, automated, experiments, studying, possible, interactions, between, mind, and, matter, in, the, most, common, experiment, of, this, type, a, random, number, generator, rng, based, on, electronic, or, radioactive, noise, produces, a, data, stream, that, is, recorded, and, analyzed, by, computer, software, a, subject, attempts, to, mentally, alter, the, distribution, of, the, random, numbers, usually, in, an, experimental, design, that, is, functionally, equivalent, to, getting, more, heads, than, tails, while, flipping, a, coin, in, the, rng, experiment, design, flexibility, can, be, combined, with, rigorous, controls, while, collecting, a, large, amount, of, data, quickly, this, technique, has, been, used, both, to, test, individuals, for, psychokinesis, and, to, test, the, possible, influence, on, rngs, of, large, groups, of, people, major, meta, analyses, of, the, rng, database, have, been, published, every, few, years, since, appearing, in, the, journal, foundations, of, physics, in, 1986, pear, founder, robert, g, jahn, and, his, colleague, brenda, dunne, say, that, the, experiments, produced, a, very, small, effect, not, significant, enough, to, be, observed, over, a, brief, experiment, but, over, a, large, number, of, trials, resulted, in, a, tiny, statistical, deviation, from, chance, according, to, massimo, pigliucci, the, results, from, pear, can, be, explained, without, invoking, the, paranormal, because, of, two, problems, with, the, experiment, the, difficulty, of, designing, machines, capable, of, generating, truly, random, events, and, the, fact, that, statistical, significance, is, not, at, all, a, good, measure, of, the, importance, or, genuineness, of, a, phenomenon, pigluicci, has, written, that, the, statistical, analysis, used, by, the, jahn, and, the, pear, group, relied, on, a, quantity, called, a, p, value, but, a, problem, with, p, values, is, that, if, the, sample, size, number, of, trials, is, very, large, like, the, pear, tests, then, one, is, guaranteed, to, find, artificially, low, p, values, indicating, a, statistically, significant, result, even, though, nothing, was, occurring, other, than, small, biases, in, the, experimental, apparatus, two, german, independent, scientific, groups, have, failed, to, replicate, the, pear, results, pigliucci, has, written, this, was, yet, another, indication, that, the, simplest, hypothesis, is, likely, to, be, true, there, was, nothing, to, replicate, the, most, recent, meta, analysis, on, psychokinesis, was, published, in, psychological, bulletin, along, with, several, critical, commentaries, it, analyzed, the, results, of, 380, studies, the, authors, reported, an, overall, positive, effect, size, that, was, statistically, significant, but, very, small, relative, to, the, sample, size, and, could, in, principle, be, explained, by, publication, bias, formerly, called, bio, pk, direct, mental, interactions, with, living, systems, dmils, studies, the, effects, of, one, person, s, intentions, on, a, distant, person, s, psychophysiological, state, one, type, of, dmils, experiment, looks, at, the, commonly, reported, feeling, of, being, stared, at, the, starer, and, the, staree, are, isolated, in, different, locations, and, the, starer, is, periodically, asked, to, simply, gaze, at, the, staree, via, closed, circuit, video, links, meanwhile, the, staree, s, nervous, system, activity, is, automatically, and, continuously, monitored, parapsychologists, have, interpreted, the, cumulative, data, on, this, and, similar, dmils, experiments, to, suggest, that, one, person, s, attention, directed, towards, a, remote, isolated, person, can, significantly, activate, or, calm, that, person, s, nervous, system, in, a, meta, analysis, of, these, experiments, published, in, the, british, journal, of, psychology, in, 2004, researchers, found, a, small, but, significant, overall, dmils, effect, however, the, study, also, found, that, the, effect, size, was, insignificant, when, a, small, number, of, the, highest, quality, studies, from, one, laboratory, were, analyzed, the, authors, concluded, that, although, the, existence, of, some, anomaly, related, to, distant, intentions, cannot, be, ruled, out, there, was, also, a, shortage, of, independent, replications, and, theoretical, concepts, parapsychological, studies, into, dream, telepathy, were, carried, out, at, the, maimonides, medical, center, in, brooklyn, new, york, led, by, stanley, krippner, and, montague, ullman, they, concluded, the, results, from, some, of, their, experiments, supported, dream, telepathy, however, the, results, have, not, been, independently, replicated, the, picture, target, experiments, that, krippner, and, ullman, conducted, were, criticized, by, c, e, m, hansel, according, to, hansel, there, were, weaknesses, in, the, design, of, the, experiments, in, the, way, in, which, the, agents, became, aware, of, their, target, picture, only, the, agent, should, have, known, the, target, and, no, other, person, should, have, known, until, the, targets, were, judged, however, an, experimenter, was, with, the, agent, when, the, target, envelope, was, opened, hansel, also, wrote, that, the, experiment, had, poor, controls, as, the, main, experimenter, could, communicate, with, the, subject, in, 2002, krippner, denied, hansel, s, accusations, claiming, the, agent, did, not, communicate, with, the, experimenter, edward, belvedere, and, david, foulkes, attempted, to, replicate, the, picture, target, experiments, the, finding, was, that, neither, the, subject, nor, the, judges, matched, the, targets, with, dreams, above, chance, level, results, from, other, experiments, by, belvedere, and, foulkes, were, also, negative, in, 2003, simon, sherwood, and, chris, roe, wrote, a, review, that, claimed, support, for, dream, telepathy, at, maimonides, however, james, alcock, noted, that, their, review, was, based, on, extreme, messiness, of, data, alcock, concluded, the, dream, telepathy, experiments, at, maimonides, have, failed, to, provide, evidence, for, telepathy, and, lack, of, replication, is, rampant, a, near, death, experience, nde, is, an, experience, reported, by, a, person, who, nearly, died, or, who, experienced, clinical, death, and, then, revived, ndes, include, one, or, more, of, the, following, experiences, a, sense, of, being, dead, an, out, of, body, experience, a, sensation, of, floating, above, one, s, body, and, seeing, the, surrounding, area, a, sense, of, overwhelming, love, and, peace, a, sensation, of, moving, upwards, through, a, tunnel, or, narrow, passageway, meeting, deceased, relatives, or, spiritual, figures, encountering, a, being, of, light, or, a, light, experiencing, a, life, review, reaching, a, border, or, boundary, and, a, feeling, of, being, returned, to, the, body, often, accompanied, by, reluctance, interest, in, the, nde, was, spurred, initially, by, the, research, of, psychiatrists, elisabeth, k, bler, ross, george, g, ritchie, and, raymond, moody, in, 1975, moody, wrote, the, best, selling, book, life, after, life, and, in, 1977, he, wrote, a, second, book, reflections, on, life, after, life, in, 1998, moody, was, appointed, chair, in, consciousness, studies, at, the, university, of, nevada, las, vegas, the, international, association, for, near, death, studies, iands, was, founded, in, 1978, to, meet, the, needs, of, early, researchers, and, experiencers, within, this, field, of, research, later, researchers, such, as, psychiatrist, bruce, greyson, psychologist, kenneth, ring, and, cardiologist, michael, sabom, introduced, the, study, of, near, death, experiences, to, the, academic, setting, psychiatrist, ian, stevenson, from, the, university, of, virginia, conducted, more, than, 2, 500, case, studies, over, 40, years, and, published, twelve, books, he, wrote, that, childhood, memories, ostensibly, related, to, reincarnation, normally, occurred, between, the, ages, of, three, and, seven, years, and, then, faded, shortly, afterward, he, compared, the, memories, with, reports, of, people, known, to, the, deceased, attempting, to, do, so, before, any, contact, between, the, child, and, the, deceased, s, family, had, occurred, and, searched, for, disconfirming, evidence, that, could, provide, alternative, explanations, for, the, reports, aside, from, reincarnation, some, 35, percent, of, the, subjects, examined, by, stevenson, had, birthmarks, or, congenital, disabilities, stevenson, believed, that, the, existence, of, birthmarks, and, deformities, on, children, when, they, occurred, at, the, location, of, fatal, wounds, in, the, deceased, provided, the, best, evidence, for, reincarnation, however, stevenson, has, never, claimed, that, he, had, proved, the, existence, of, reincarnation, and, cautiously, referred, to, his, cases, as, being, of, the, reincarnation, type, or, suggestive, of, reincarnation, researchers, who, believe, in, the, evidence, for, reincarnation, have, been, unsuccessful, in, getting, the, scientific, community, to, consider, it, a, serious, possibility, ian, wilson, argued, that, a, large, number, of, stevenson, s, cases, consisted, of, poor, children, remembering, wealthy, lives, or, belonging, to, a, higher, caste, he, speculated, that, such, cases, may, represent, a, scheme, to, obtain, money, from, the, family, of, the, alleged, former, incarnation, philosopher, keith, augustine, has, written, the, vast, majority, of, stevenson, s, cases, come, from, countries, where, a, religious, belief, in, reincarnation, is, strong, and, rarely, elsewhere, seems, to, indicate, that, cultural, conditioning, rather, than, reincarnation, generates, claims, of, spontaneous, past, life, memories, philosopher, paul, edwards, wrote, that, reincarnation, invokes, logically, dubious, assumptions, and, is, inconsistent, with, modern, science, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, support, the, existence, of, psi, phenomena, scientists, critical, of, parapsychology, state, that, its, extraordinary, claims, demand, extraordinary, evidence, if, they, are, to, be, taken, seriously, scientists, who, have, evaluated, parapsychology, have, written, the, entire, body, of, evidence, is, of, poor, quality, and, not, adequately, controlled, in, support, of, this, view, critics, cite, instances, of, fraud, flawed, studies, and, cognitive, biases, such, as, clustering, illusion, availability, error, confirmation, bias, illusion, of, control, magical, thinking, and, the, bias, blind, spot, as, ways, to, explain, parapsychological, results, research, has, also, shown, that, people, s, desire, to, believe, in, paranormal, phenomena, causes, them, to, discount, strong, evidence, that, it, does, not, exist, the, psychologists, donovan, rawcliffe, 1952, c, e, m, hansel, 1980, ray, hyman, 1989, and, andrew, neher, 2011, have, studied, the, history, of, psi, experiments, from, the, late, 19th, century, up, until, the, 1980s, flaws, and, weaknesses, were, discovered, in, every, experiment, investigated, so, the, possibility, of, sensory, leakage, and, trickery, were, not, ruled, out, the, data, from, the, creery, sister, and, the, soal, goldney, experiments, were, proven, to, be, fraudulent, one, of, the, subjects, from, the, smith, blackburn, experiments, confessed, to, fraud, the, brugmans, experiment, the, experiments, by, john, edgar, coover, and, those, conducted, by, joseph, gaither, pratt, and, helmut, schmidt, had, flaws, in, the, design, of, the, experiments, did, not, rule, out, the, possibility, of, sensory, cues, or, trickery, and, have, not, been, replicated, according, to, critics, psi, is, negatively, defined, as, any, effect, that, cannot, be, currently, explained, in, terms, of, chance, or, normal, causes, and, this, is, a, fallacy, as, it, encourages, parapsychologists, to, use, any, peculiarity, in, the, data, as, a, characteristic, of, psi, parapsychologists, have, admitted, it, is, impossible, to, eliminate, the, possibility, of, non, paranormal, causes, in, their, experiments, there, is, no, independent, method, to, indicate, the, presence, or, absence, of, psi, persi, diaconis, has, written, that, the, controls, in, parapsychological, experiments, are, often, loose, with, possibilities, of, subject, cheating, and, unconscious, sensory, cues, in, 1998, physics, professor, michael, w, friedlander, noted, that, parapsychology, has, failed, to, produce, any, clear, evidence, for, the, existence, of, anomalous, effects, that, require, us, to, go, beyond, the, known, region, of, science, philosopher, and, skeptic, robert, todd, carroll, has, written, research, in, parapsychology, has, been, characterized, by, deception, fraud, and, incompetence, in, setting, up, properly, controlled, experiments, and, evaluating, statistical, data, the, psychologist, ray, hyman, has, pointed, out, that, some, parapsychologists, such, as, dick, bierman, walter, lucadou, j, e, kennedy, and, robert, jahn, have, admitted, the, evidence, for, psi, is, inconsistent, irreproducible, and, fails, to, meet, acceptable, scientific, standards, richard, wiseman, has, criticized, the, parapsychological, community, for, widespread, errors, in, research, methods, including, cherry, picking, new, procedures, which, may, produce, preferred, results, explaining, away, unsuccessful, attempted, replications, with, claims, of, an, experimenter, effect, data, mining, and, retrospective, data, selection, independent, evaluators, and, researchers, dispute, the, existence, of, parapsychological, phenomena, and, the, scientific, validity, of, parapsychological, research, in, 1988, the, u, s, national, academy, of, sciences, published, a, report, on, the, subject, that, concluded, that, no, scientific, justification, from, research, conducted, over, a, period, of, 130, years, for, the, existence, of, parapsychological, phenomena, no, accepted, theory, of, parapsychology, currently, exists, and, many, competing, and, often, conflicting, models, have, been, advocated, by, different, parapsychologists, in, an, attempt, to, explain, reported, paranormal, phenomena, terence, hines, in, his, book, pseudoscience, and, the, paranormal, 2003, wrote, many, theories, have, been, proposed, by, parapsychologists, to, explain, how, psi, takes, place, to, skeptics, such, theory, building, seems, premature, as, the, phenomena, to, be, explained, by, the, theories, have, yet, to, be, demonstrated, convincingly, skeptics, such, as, antony, flew, have, cited, the, lack, of, such, a, theory, as, their, reason, for, rejecting, parapsychology, in, a, review, of, parapsychological, reports, hyman, wrote, randomization, is, often, inadequate, multiple, statistical, testing, without, adjustment, for, significance, levels, is, prevalent, possibilities, for, sensory, leakage, are, not, uniformly, prevented, errors, in, use, of, statistical, tests, are, much, too, common, and, documentation, is, typically, inadequate, parapsychology, has, been, criticized, for, making, no, precise, predictions, in, 2003, james, alcock, professor, of, psychology, at, york, university, published, give, the, null, hypothesis, a, chance, reasons, to, remain, doubtful, about, the, existence, of, psi, where, he, claimed, that, parapsychologists, never, seem, to, take, seriously, the, possibility, that, psi, does, not, exist, because, of, that, they, interpret, null, results, as, indicating, only, that, they, were, unable, to, observe, psi, in, a, particular, experiment, rather, than, taking, it, as, support, for, the, possibility, that, there, is, no, psi, the, failure, to, take, the, null, hypothesis, as, a, serious, alternative, to, their, psi, hypotheses, leads, them, to, rely, upon, many, arbitrary, effects, to, excuse, failures, to, find, predicted, effects, excuse, the, lack, of, consistency, in, outcomes, and, excuse, failures, to, replicate, fundamental, endemic, problems, in, parapsychological, research, include, amongst, others, insufficient, definition, of, the, subject, matter, total, reliance, on, negative, definitions, of, their, phenomena, e, g, psi, is, said, to, occur, only, when, all, known, normal, influences, are, ruled, out, failure, to, produce, a, single, phenomenon, that, neutral, researchers, can, independently, replicate, the, invention, of, effects, such, as, the, psi, experimenter, effect, to, explain, away, inconsistencies, in, the, data, and, failures, to, achieve, predicted, outcomes, unfalsifiability, of, claims, the, unpredictability, of, effects, lack, of, progress, in, over, a, century, of, formal, research, methodological, weaknesses, reliance, on, statistical, procedures, to, determine, when, psi, has, supposedly, occurred, even, though, statistical, analysis, does, not, in, itself, justify, a, claim, that, psi, has, occurred, and, failure, to, jibe, with, other, areas, of, science, overall, he, argues, that, there, is, nothing, in, parapsychological, research, that, would, ever, lead, parapsychologists, to, conclude, that, psi, does, not, exist, so, even, if, it, does, not, the, search, will, likely, continue, for, a, long, time, i, continue, to, believe, that, parapsychology, is, at, bottom, motivated, by, belief, in, search, of, data, rather, than, data, in, search, of, explanation, alcock, and, cognitive, psychologist, arthur, s, reber, have, criticized, parapsychology, broadly, writing, that, if, psi, effects, were, true, they, would, negate, fundamental, principles, of, science, such, as, causality, time, s, arrow, thermodynamics, and, the, inverse, square, law, according, to, alcock, and, reber, parapsychology, cannot, be, true, unless, the, rest, of, science, isn, t, moreover, if, psi, effects, were, real, they, would, have, already, fatally, disrupted, the, rest, of, the, body, of, science, richard, land, has, written, that, from, what, is, known, about, human, biology, it, is, implausible, that, evolution, has, provided, humans, with, esp, as, research, has, shown, the, recognized, five, senses, are, adequate, for, the, evolution, and, survival, of, the, species, michael, shermer, in, the, article, psychic, drift, why, most, scientists, do, not, believe, in, esp, and, psi, phenomena, for, scientific, american, wrote, the, reason, for, skepticism, is, that, we, need, replicable, data, and, a, viable, theory, both, of, which, are, missing, in, psi, research, in, january, 2008, the, results, of, a, study, using, neuroimaging, were, published, to, provide, what, are, purported, to, be, the, most, favorable, experimental, conditions, the, study, included, appropriate, emotional, stimuli, and, had, biologically, or, emotionally, related, participants, such, as, twins, the, experiment, was, designed, to, produce, positive, results, if, telepathy, clairvoyance, or, precognition, occurred, still, despite, this, no, distinguishable, neuronal, responses, were, found, between, psychic, and, non, psychic, stimuli, while, variations, in, the, same, stimuli, showed, anticipated, effects, on, brain, activation, patterns, the, researchers, concluded, these, findings, are, the, strongest, evidence, yet, obtained, against, the, existence, of, paranormal, mental, phenomena, other, studies, have, attempted, to, test, the, psi, hypothesis, by, using, functional, neuroimaging, a, neuroscience, review, of, the, studies, acunzo, et, al, 2013, discovered, methodological, weaknesses, that, could, account, for, the, reported, psi, effects, a, 2014, study, discovered, that, schizophrenic, patients, have, more, belief, in, psi, than, healthy, adults, some, researchers, have, become, skeptical, of, parapsychology, such, as, susan, blackmore, and, john, taylor, after, years, of, study, and, no, progress, in, demonstrating, the, existence, of, psi, by, the, scientific, method, the, ideas, of, psi, precognition, psychokinesis, and, telepathy, violate, well, established, laws, of, physics, psychokinesis, violates, the, inverse, square, law, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, and, the, conservation, of, momentum, there, is, no, known, mechanism, for, psi, on, the, subject, of, psychokinesis, the, physicist, sean, m, carroll, has, written, that, both, human, brains, and, the, spoons, they, try, to, bend, are, made, like, all, matter, of, quarks, and, leptons, everything, else, they, do, emerges, as, properties, of, the, behavior, of, quarks, and, leptons, the, quarks, and, leptons, interact, through, the, four, forces, strong, weak, electromagnetic, and, gravitational, thus, either, it, is, one, of, the, four, known, forces, or, it, is, a, new, force, and, any, new, force, with, a, range, over, 1, millimeter, must, be, at, most, a, billionth, the, strength, of, gravity, or, it, will, have, been, captured, in, experiments, already, done, this, leaves, no, physical, force, that, could, account, for, psychokinesis, physicist, john, g, taylor, who, investigated, parapsychological, claims, wrote, that, an, unknown, fifth, force, causing, psychokinesis, would, have, to, transmit, a, great, deal, of, energy, the, energy, would, have, to, overcome, the, electromagnetic, forces, binding, the, atoms, together, the, atoms, would, need, to, respond, more, strongly, to, the, fifth, force, while, it, is, operative, than, to, electric, forces, therefore, such, an, additional, force, between, atoms, should, exist, all, the, time, and, not, only, during, alleged, paranormal, occurrences, taylor, wrote, there, is, no, scientific, trace, of, such, a, force, in, physics, down, to, many, orders, of, magnitude, thus, if, a, scientific, viewpoint, is, to, be, preserved, the, idea, of, any, fifth, force, must, be, discarded, taylor, concluded, there, is, no, possible, physical, mechanism, for, psychokinesis, and, it, is, in, complete, contradiction, to, established, science, felix, planer, a, professor, of, electrical, engineering, has, written, that, if, psychokinesis, were, real, then, it, would, be, easy, to, demonstrate, by, getting, subjects, to, depress, a, scale, on, a, sensitive, balance, raise, the, temperature, of, a, water, bath, which, could, be, measured, with, an, accuracy, of, a, hundredth, of, a, degree, celsius, or, affect, an, element, in, an, electrical, circuit, such, as, a, resistor, which, could, be, monitored, to, better, than, a, millionth, of, an, ampere, planer, writes, that, such, experiments, are, extremely, sensitive, and, easy, to, monitor, but, are, not, utilized, by, parapsychologists, as, they, do, not, hold, out, the, remotest, hope, of, demonstrating, even, a, minute, trace, of, pk, because, the, alleged, phenomenon, is, non, existent, planer, has, written, that, parapsychologists, fall, back, on, studies, that, involve, only, unrepeatable, statistics, owing, their, results, to, poor, experimental, methods, recording, mistakes, and, faulty, statistical, mathematics, according, to, planer, all, research, in, medicine, and, other, sciences, would, become, illusionary, if, the, existence, of, pk, had, to, be, taken, seriously, for, no, experiment, could, be, relied, upon, to, furnish, objective, results, since, all, measurements, would, become, falsified, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, according, to, his, pk, ability, by, the, experimenter, s, wishes, planer, concluded, the, concept, of, psychokinesis, is, absurd, and, has, no, scientific, basis, philosopher, and, physicist, mario, bunge, has, written, that, psychokinesis, or, pk, violates, the, principle, that, mind, cannot, act, directly, on, matter, if, it, did, no, experimenter, could, trust, his, readings, of, measuring, instruments, it, also, violates, the, principles, of, conservation, of, energy, and, momentum, the, claim, that, quantum, mechanics, allows, for, the, possibility, of, mental, power, influencing, randomizers, an, alleged, case, of, micro, pk, is, ludicrous, since, that, theory, respects, the, said, conservation, principles, and, it, deals, exclusively, with, physical, things, the, physicist, robert, l, park, questioned, if, the, mind, really, could, influence, matter, then, it, would, be, easy, for, parapsychologists, to, measure, such, a, phenomenon, by, using, the, alleged, psychokinetic, power, to, deflect, a, microbalance, which, would, not, require, any, dubious, statistics, but, the, reason, of, course, is, that, the, microbalance, stubbornly, refuses, to, budge, park, has, suggested, the, reason, statistical, studies, are, so, popular, in, parapsychology, is, because, they, introduce, opportunities, for, uncertainty, and, error, which, are, used, to, support, the, biases, of, the, experimenter, park, wrote, no, proof, of, psychic, phenomena, is, ever, found, in, spite, of, all, the, tests, devised, by, parapsychologists, like, jahn, and, radin, and, huge, amounts, of, data, collected, over, a, period, of, many, years, the, results, are, no, more, convincing, today, than, when, they, began, their, experiments, parapsychological, theories, are, viewed, as, pseudoscientific, by, the, scientific, community, as, incompatible, with, well, established, laws, of, science, as, there, is, no, repeatable, evidence, for, psi, the, field, is, often, regarded, as, a, pseudoscience, the, philosopher, raimo, tuomela, summarized, why, the, majority, of, scientists, consider, parapsychology, to, be, a, pseudoscience, in, his, essay, science, protoscience, and, pseudoscience, the, methods, of, parapsychologists, are, regarded, by, critics, including, those, who, wrote, the, science, standards, for, the, california, state, board, of, education, to, be, pseudoscientific, some, of, the, more, specific, criticisms, state, that, parapsychology, does, not, have, a, clearly, defined, subject, matter, an, easily, repeatable, experiment, that, can, demonstrate, a, psi, effect, on, demand, nor, an, underlying, theory, to, explain, the, paranormal, transfer, of, information, james, alcock, has, stated, that, few, of, parapsychology, s, experimental, results, have, prompted, interdisciplinary, research, with, more, mainstream, sciences, such, as, physics, or, biology, and, that, parapsychology, remains, an, isolated, science, to, such, an, extent, that, its, very, legitimacy, is, questionable, and, as, a, whole, is, not, justified, in, being, labeled, scientific, alcock, wrote, parapsychology, is, indistinguishable, from, pseudo, science, and, its, ideas, are, essentially, those, of, magic, there, is, no, evidence, that, would, lead, the, cautious, observer, to, believe, that, parapsychologists, and, paraphysicists, are, on, the, track, of, a, real, phenomenon, a, real, energy, or, power, that, has, so, far, escaped, the, attention, of, those, people, engaged, in, normal, science, the, scientific, community, considers, parapsychology, a, pseudoscience, because, it, continues, to, explore, the, hypothesis, that, psychic, abilities, exist, despite, a, century, of, experimental, results, that, fail, to, demonstrate, that, hypothesis, conclusively, a, panel, commissioned, by, the, united, states, national, research, council, to, study, paranormal, claims, concluded, that, despite, a, 130, year, record, of, scientific, research, on, such, matters, our, committee, could, find, no, scientific, justification, for, the, existence, of, phenomena, such, as, extrasensory, perception, mental, telepathy, or, mind, over, matter, exercises, evaluation, of, a, large, body, of, the, best, available, evidence, simply, does, not, support, the, contention, that, these, phenomena, exist, there, is, also, an, issue, of, non, falsifiability, associated, with, psi, on, this, subject, terence, hines, has, written, the, most, common, rationale, offered, by, parapsychologists, to, explain, the, lack, of, a, repeatable, demonstration, of, esp, or, other, psi, phenomena, is, to, say, that, esp, in, particular, and, psi, phenomena, in, general, are, elusive, or, jealous, phenomena, this, means, the, phenomena, go, away, when, a, skeptic, is, present, or, when, skeptical, vibrations, are, present, this, argument, seems, nicely, to, explain, away, some, of, the, major, problems, facing, parapsychology, until, it, is, realized, that, it, is, nothing, more, than, a, classic, nonfalsifiable, hypothesis, the, use, of, the, nonfalsifiable, hypothesis, is, permitted, in, parapsychology, to, a, degree, unheard, of, in, any, scientific, discipline, to, the, extent, that, investigators, accept, this, type, of, hypothesis, they, will, be, immune, to, having, their, belief, in, psi, disproved, no, matter, how, many, experiments, fail, to, provide, evidence, for, psi, and, no, matter, how, good, those, experiments, are, the, nonfalsifiable, hypothesis, will, always, protect, the, belief, mario, bunge, has, written, that, research, in, parapsychology, for, over, a, hundred, years, has, produced, no, firm, findings, or, testable, predictions, all, parapsychologists, can, do, is, claim, alleged, data, is, anomalous, and, beyond, the, reach, of, ordinary, science, the, aim, of, parapsychologists, is, not, that, of, finding, laws, and, systematizing, them, into, theories, in, order, to, understand, and, forecast, but, to, buttress, ancient, spiritualist, myths, or, to, serve, as, a, surrogate, for, lost, religions, the, psychologist, david, marks, has, written, that, parapsychologists, have, failed, to, produce, a, single, repeatable, demonstration, of, the, paranormal, and, described, psychical, research, as, a, pseudoscience, an, incoherent, collection, of, belief, systems, steeped, in, fantasy, illusion, and, error, however, chris, french, who, is, not, convinced, that, parapsychology, has, demonstrated, evidence, for, psi, has, argued, that, parapsychological, experiments, still, adhere, to, the, scientific, method, and, should, not, be, completely, dismissed, as, pseudoscience, sceptics, like, myself, will, often, point, out, that, there, s, been, systematic, research, in, parapsychology, for, well, over, a, century, and, so, far, the, wider, scientific, community, is, not, convinced, french, has, noted, his, position, is, the, minority, view, among, critics, of, parapsychology, philosopher, bradley, dowden, characterized, parapsychology, as, a, pseudoscience, because, parapsychologists, have, no, valid, theories, to, test, or, reproducible, data, from, their, experiments, there, have, been, instances, of, fraud, in, the, history, of, parapsychology, research, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, creery, sisters, mary, alice, maud, kathleen, and, emily, were, tested, by, the, society, for, psychical, research, and, believed, them, to, have, genuine, psychic, ability, however, during, a, later, experiment, they, were, caught, utilizing, signal, codes, and, they, confessed, to, fraud, george, albert, smith, and, douglas, blackburn, were, claimed, to, be, genuine, psychics, by, the, society, for, psychical, research, but, blackburn, confessed, to, fraud, for, nearly, thirty, years, the, telepathic, experiments, conducted, by, mr, g, a, smith, and, myself, have, been, accepted, and, cited, as, the, basic, evidence, of, the, truth, of, thought, transference, the, whole, of, those, alleged, experiments, were, bogus, and, originated, in, the, honest, desire, of, two, youths, to, show, how, easily, men, of, scientific, mind, and, training, could, be, deceived, when, seeking, for, evidence, in, support, of, a, theory, they, were, wishful, to, establish, the, experiments, of, samuel, soal, and, k, m, goldney, of, 1941, 1943, suggesting, the, precognitive, ability, of, a, single, participant, were, long, regarded, as, some, of, the, best, in, the, field, because, they, relied, upon, independent, checking, and, witnesses, to, prevent, fraud, however, many, years, later, statistical, evidence, uncovered, and, published, by, other, parapsychologists, in, the, field, suggested, that, soal, had, cheated, by, altering, some, of, the, raw, data, 140, 141, in, 1974, many, experiments, by, walter, j, levy, j, b, rhine, s, successor, as, director, of, the, institute, for, parapsychology, were, exposed, as, fraudulent, levy, had, reported, on, a, series, of, successful, esp, experiments, involving, computer, controlled, manipulation, of, non, human, subjects, including, rats, his, experiments, showed, very, high, positive, results, however, levy, s, fellow, researchers, became, suspicious, about, his, methods, they, found, that, levy, interfered, with, data, recording, equipment, manually, creating, fraudulent, strings, of, positive, results, levy, confessed, to, the, fraud, and, resigned, in, 1974, rhine, published, the, paper, security, versus, deception, in, parapsychology, in, the, journal, of, parapsychology, which, documented, 12, cases, of, fraud, that, he, had, detected, from, 1940, to, 1950, but, refused, to, give, the, names, of, the, participants, in, the, studies, massimo, pigliucci, has, written, most, damning, of, all, rhine, admitted, publicly, that, he, had, uncovered, at, least, twelve, instances, of, dishonesty, among, his, researchers, in, a, single, decade, from, 1940, to, 1950, however, he, flaunted, standard, academic, protocol, by, refusing, to, divulge, the, names, of, the, fraudsters, which, means, that, there, is, unknown, number, of, published, papers, in, the, literature, that, claim, paranormal, effects, while, in, fact, they, were, the, result, of, conscious, deception, martin, gardner, claimed, to, have, inside, information, that, files, in, rhine, s, laboratory, contain, material, suggesting, fraud, on, the, part, of, hubert, pearce, pearce, was, never, able, to, obtain, above, chance, results, when, persons, other, than, the, experimenter, were, present, during, an, experiment, making, it, more, likely, that, he, was, cheating, in, some, way, rhine, s, other, subjects, could, only, obtain, non, chance, levels, when, they, could, shuffle, the, cards, which, suggested, they, used, tricks, to, arrange, the, order, of, the, zener, cards, before, the, experiments, started, a, researcher, from, tarkio, college, in, missouri, james, d, macfarland, was, suspected, of, falsifying, data, to, achieve, positive, psi, results, before, the, fraud, was, discovered, macfarland, published, two, articles, in, the, journal, of, parapsychology, 1937, 1938, supporting, the, existence, of, esp, presumably, speaking, about, macfarland, louisa, rhine, wrote, that, in, reviewing, the, data, submitted, to, the, lab, in, 1938, the, researchers, at, the, duke, parapsychology, lab, recognized, the, fraud, before, long, they, were, all, certain, that, jim, had, consistently, falsified, his, records, to, produce, extra, hits, jim, had, to, resort, to, erasures, and, transpositions, in, the, records, of, his, call, series, macfarland, never, published, another, article, in, the, journal, of, parapsychology, after, the, fraud, was, discovered, some, instances, of, fraud, amongst, spiritualist, mediums, were, exposed, by, early, psychical, researchers, such, as, richard, hodgson, and, harry, price, in, the, 1920s, magician, and, escapologist, harry, houdini, said, that, researchers, and, observers, had, not, created, experimental, procedures, that, preclude, fraud, critical, analysts, including, some, parapsychologists, are, unsatisfied, with, experimental, parapsychology, studies, some, reviewers, such, as, psychologist, ray, hyman, contend, that, apparently, successful, experimental, results, in, psi, research, are, more, likely, due, to, sloppy, procedures, poorly, trained, researchers, or, methodological, flaws, rather, than, to, genuine, psi, effects, fellow, psychologist, stuart, vyse, hearkens, back, to, a, time, of, data, manipulation, now, recognized, as, p, hacking, as, part, of, the, issue, within, parapsychology, there, are, disagreements, over, the, results, and, methodology, as, well, for, example, the, experiments, at, the, pear, laboratory, were, criticized, in, a, paper, published, by, the, journal, of, parapsychology, in, which, parapsychologists, independent, from, the, pear, laboratory, concluded, that, these, experiments, depart, from, criteria, usually, expected, in, formal, scientific, experimentation, due, to, roblems, with, regard, to, randomization, statistical, baselines, application, of, statistical, models, agent, coding, of, descriptor, lists, feedback, to, percipients, sensory, cues, and, precautions, against, cheating, they, felt, that, the, originally, stated, significance, values, were, meaningless, a, typical, measure, of, psi, phenomena, is, a, statistical, deviation, from, chance, expectation, however, critics, point, out, that, statistical, deviation, is, strictly, speaking, only, evidence, of, a, statistical, anomaly, and, the, cause, of, the, deviation, is, not, known, hyman, contends, that, even, if, psi, experiments, that, regularly, reproduce, similar, deviations, from, chance, could, be, designed, they, would, not, necessarily, prove, psychic, functioning, critics, have, coined, the, term, the, psi, assumption, to, describe, the, assumption, that, any, significant, departure, from, the, laws, of, chance, in, a, test, of, psychic, ability, is, evidence, that, something, anomalous, or, paranormal, has, occurred, assuming, what, they, should, be, proving, these, critics, hold, that, concluding, the, existence, of, psychic, phenomena, based, on, chance, deviation, in, inadequately, designed, experiments, is, affirming, the, consequent, or, begging, the, question, in, 1979, magician, and, debunker, james, randi, engineered, a, hoax, now, referred, to, as, project, alpha, to, encourage, a, tightening, of, standards, within, the, parapsychology, community, randi, recruited, two, young, magicians, and, sent, them, undercover, to, washington, university, s, mcdonnell, laboratory, where, they, fooled, researchers, into, believing, they, had, paranormal, powers, the, aim, was, to, expose, poor, experimental, methods, and, the, credulity, thought, to, be, common, in, parapsychology, randi, has, stated, that, both, of, his, recruits, deceived, experimenters, for, three, years, with, demonstrations, of, supposedly, psychic, abilities, blowing, electric, fuses, sealed, in, a, box, causing, a, lightweight, paper, rotor, perched, atop, a, needle, to, turn, inside, a, bell, jar, bending, metal, spoons, sealed, in, a, glass, bottle, etc, the, hoax, by, randi, raised, ethical, concerns, in, the, scientific, and, parapsychology, communities, eliciting, criticism, even, among, skeptical, communities, such, as, the, committee, for, the, scientific, investigation, of, claims, of, the, paranormal, csicop, which, he, helped, found, but, also, positive, responses, from, the, president, of, the, parapsychological, association, stanley, krippner, psychologist, ray, hyman, a, csicop, member, called, the, results, counterproductive, selective, reporting, has, been, offered, by, critics, as, an, explanation, for, the, positive, results, reported, by, parapsychologists, selective, reporting, is, sometimes, called, a, file, drawer, problem, which, arises, when, only, positive, study, results, are, made, public, while, studies, with, negative, or, null, results, are, not, made, public, selective, reporting, has, a, compounded, effect, on, meta, analysis, which, is, a, statistical, technique, that, aggregates, the, results, of, many, studies, to, generate, sufficient, statistical, power, to, demonstrate, a, result, that, the, individual, studies, themselves, could, not, demonstrate, at, a, statistically, significant, level, for, example, a, recent, meta, analysis, combined, 380, studies, on, psychokinesis, including, data, from, the, pear, lab, it, concluded, that, although, there, is, a, statistically, significant, overall, effect, it, is, inconsistent, and, relatively, few, negative, studies, would, cancel, it, out, consequently, biased, publication, of, positive, results, could, be, the, cause, numerous, researchers, have, criticized, the, popularity, of, meta, analysis, in, parapsychology, and, is, often, seen, as, troublesome, even, within, parapsychology, critics, have, said, that, parapsychologists, misuse, meta, analysis, to, create, the, incorrect, impression, that, statistically, significant, results, have, been, obtained, that, indicate, the, existence, of, psi, phenomena, physicist, robert, park, states, that, parapsychology, s, reported, positive, results, are, problematic, because, most, such, findings, are, invariably, at, the, margin, of, statistical, significance, and, that, might, be, explained, by, a, number, of, confounding, effects, park, states, that, such, marginal, results, are, a, typical, symptom, of, pathological, science, as, described, by, irving, langmuir, researcher, j, e, kennedy, has, said, that, concerns, over, meta, analysis, in, science, and, medicine, also, apply, to, problems, present, in, parapsychological, meta, analysis, as, a, post, hoc, analysis, critics, emphasize, the, opportunity, the, method, presents, to, produce, biased, outcomes, via, selecting, cases, chosen, for, study, methods, employed, and, other, key, criteria, critics, say, that, analogous, problems, with, meta, analysis, have, been, documented, in, medicine, where, it, has, been, shown, different, investigators, performing, meta, analyses, of, the, same, set, of, studies, have, reached, contradictory, conclusions, in, anomalistic, psychology, paranormal, phenomena, have, naturalistic, explanations, resulting, from, psychological, and, physical, factors, which, have, sometimes, given, the, impression, of, paranormal, activity, to, some, people, when, in, fact, there, have, been, none, according, to, the, psychologist, chris, french, the, difference, between, anomalistic, psychology, and, parapsychology, is, in, terms, of, the, aims, of, what, each, discipline, is, about, parapsychologists, typically, are, actually, searching, for, evidence, to, prove, the, reality, of, paranormal, forces, to, prove, they, really, do, exist, so, the, starting, assumption, is, that, paranormal, things, do, happen, whereas, anomalistic, psychologists, tend, to, start, from, the, position, that, paranormal, forces, probably, don, t, exist, and, that, therefore, we, should, be, looking, for, other, kinds, of, explanations, in, particular, the, psychological, explanations, for, those, experiences, that, people, typically, label, as, paranormal, while, parapsychology, has, declined, anomalistic, psychology, has, risen, it, is, now, offered, as, an, option, in, some, psychology, degree, programs, it, is, also, an, option, on, the, a2, psychology, syllabus, in, the, uk, organizations, that, encourage, a, critical, examination, of, parapsychology, and, parapsychological, research, include, the, committee, for, skeptical, inquiry, publisher, of, the, skeptical, inquirer, the, james, randi, educational, foundation, founded, by, illusionist, and, skeptic, james, randi, and, the, occult, investigative, committee, of, the, society, of, american, magicians, a, society, for, professional, magicians, illusionists, that, seeks, the, promotion, of, harmony, among, magicians, and, the, opposition, of, the, unnecessary, public, exposure, of, magical, effects
