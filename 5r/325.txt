https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_mythology
comparative, mythology, is, the, comparison, of, myths, from, different, cultures, in, an, attempt, to, identify, shared, themes, and, characteristics, comparative, mythology, has, served, a, variety, of, academic, purposes, for, example, scholars, have, used, the, relationships, between, different, myths, to, trace, the, development, of, religions, and, cultures, to, propose, common, origins, for, myths, from, different, cultures, and, to, support, various, psychoanalytical, theories, the, comparative, study, of, mythologies, reveals, the, trans, national, motifs, that, unify, spiritual, understanding, globally, the, significance, of, this, study, generates, a, broad, sympathetic, understanding, of, these, stories, in, human, history, the, similarities, of, myths, remind, humanity, of, the, universality, in, the, human, experience, anthropologist, c, scott, littleton, defined, comparative, mythology, as, the, systematic, comparison, of, myths, and, mythic, themes, drawn, from, a, wide, variety, of, cultures, by, comparing, different, cultures, mythologies, scholars, try, to, identify, underlying, similarities, and, or, to, reconstruct, a, protomythology, from, which, those, mythologies, developed, to, an, extent, all, theories, about, mythology, follow, a, comparative, approach, as, scholar, of, religion, robert, segal, notes, by, definition, all, theorists, seek, similarities, among, myths, however, scholars, of, mythology, can, be, roughly, divided, into, particularists, who, emphasize, the, differences, between, myths, and, comparativists, who, emphasize, the, similarities, particularists, tend, to, maintain, that, the, similarities, deciphered, by, comparativists, are, vague, and, superficial, while, comparativists, tend, to, contend, that, the, differences, etched, by, particularists, are, trivial, and, incidental, comparative, approaches, to, mythology, held, great, popularity, among, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, century, scholars, many, of, these, scholars, believed, that, all, myths, showed, signs, of, having, evolved, from, a, thought, which, interpreted, nearly, all, myths, as, poetic, descriptions, of, the, sun, s, behavior, according, to, this, theory, these, poetic, descriptions, had, become, distorted, over, time, into, seemingly, diverse, stories, about, gods, and, heroes, however, modern, day, scholars, lean, more, toward, particularism, feeling, suspicious, of, broad, statements, about, myths, a, recent, exception, is, the, historical, approach, followed, in, e, j, michael, witzel, s, reconstruction, of, many, subsequent, layers, of, older, myths, comparative, mythologists, come, from, various, fields, including, folklore, literature, history, linguistics, and, religious, studies, and, they, have, used, a, variety, of, methods, to, compare, myths, some, scholars, look, at, the, linguistic, relationships, between, the, myths, of, different, cultures, for, example, the, similarities, between, the, names, of, gods, in, different, cultures, one, particularly, successful, example, of, this, approach, is, the, study, of, indo, european, mythology, scholars, have, found, striking, similarities, between, the, mythological, and, religious, terms, used, in, different, cultures, of, europe, and, india, for, example, the, greek, sky, god, zeus, pater, the, roman, sky, god, jupiter, and, the, indian, vedic, sky, god, dyau, pit, have, linguistically, identical, names, this, suggests, that, the, greeks, romans, and, indians, originated, from, a, common, ancestral, culture, and, that, the, names, zeus, jupiter, dyaus, and, the, germanic, tiu, cf, english, tues, day, evolved, from, an, older, name, dy, us, ph, 2, ter, which, referred, to, the, sky, god, or, to, give, an, english, cognate, the, divine, father, in, a, proto, indo, european, religion, an, approach, which, is, both, historical, and, comparative, was, recently, proposed, by, e, j, michael, witzel, he, compares, collections, of, mythologies, and, reconstructs, increasingly, older, levels, parallel, to, but, not, necessarily, dependent, on, language, families, the, most, prominent, common, feature, is, a, storyline, that, extends, from, the, creation, of, the, world, and, of, humans, to, their, end, this, feature, is, found, in, the, northern, mythologies, of, eurasia, and, the, americas, laurasia, while, it, is, missing, in, the, southern, mythologies, of, subsaharan, africa, new, guinea, and, australia, gondwanaland, mythological, phylogenies, also, are, a, potentially, powerful, way, to, test, hypotheses, about, cross, cultural, relationships, among, folktales, some, scholars, look, for, underlying, structures, shared, by, different, myths, the, folklorist, vladimir, propp, proposed, that, many, russian, fairy, tales, have, a, common, plot, structure, in, which, certain, events, happen, in, a, predictable, order, in, contrast, the, anthropologist, claude, l, vi, strauss, examined, the, structure, of, a, myth, in, terms, of, the, abstract, relationships, between, its, elements, rather, than, their, order, in, the, plot, in, particular, l, vi, strauss, believed, that, the, elements, of, a, myth, could, be, organized, into, binary, oppositions, raw, vs, cooked, nature, vs, culture, etc, he, thought, that, the, myth, s, purpose, was, to, mediate, these, oppositions, thereby, resolving, basic, tensions, or, contradictions, found, in, human, life, or, culture, some, scholars, propose, that, myths, from, different, cultures, reveal, the, same, or, similar, psychoanalytic, forces, at, work, in, those, cultures, some, freudian, thinkers, have, identified, stories, similar, to, the, greek, story, of, oedipus, in, many, different, cultures, they, argue, that, these, stories, reflect, the, different, expressions, of, the, oedipus, complex, in, those, cultures, likewise, jungians, have, identified, images, themes, and, patterns, that, appear, in, the, myths, of, many, different, cultures, they, believe, that, these, similarities, result, from, archetypes, present, in, the, unconscious, levels, of, every, person, s, mind, a, creation, myth, or, cosmogonic, myth, is, a, symbolic, narrative, of, how, the, world, began, and, how, people, first, came, to, inhabit, it, while, in, popular, usage, the, term, myth, often, refers, to, false, or, fanciful, stories, members, of, cultures, often, ascribe, varying, degrees, of, truth, to, their, creation, myths, in, the, society, in, which, it, is, told, a, creation, myth, is, usually, regarded, as, conveying, profound, truths, metaphorically, symbolically, historically, or, literally, they, are, commonly, although, not, always, considered, cosmogonical, myths, that, is, they, describe, the, ordering, of, the, cosmos, from, a, state, of, chaos, or, amorphousness, creation, myths, often, share, a, number, of, features, they, often, are, considered, sacred, accounts, and, can, be, found, in, nearly, all, known, religious, traditions, they, are, all, stories, with, a, plot, and, characters, who, are, either, deities, human, like, figures, or, animals, who, often, speak, and, transform, easily, they, are, often, set, in, a, dim, and, nonspecific, past, that, historian, of, religion, mircea, eliade, termed, in, illo, tempore, at, that, time, creation, myths, address, questions, deeply, meaningful, to, the, society, that, shares, them, revealing, their, central, worldview, and, the, framework, for, the, self, identity, of, the, culture, and, individual, in, a, universal, context, creation, myths, develop, in, oral, traditions, and, therefore, typically, have, multiple, versions, found, throughout, human, culture, they, are, the, most, common, form, of, myth, chaos,

feature, a, god, who, dies, and, who, often, returns, to, life, such, myths, are, particularly, common, in, near, eastern, mythologies, the, anthropologist, sir, james, frazer, compared, these, dying,
