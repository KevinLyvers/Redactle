yahweh, was, an, ancient, levantine, deity, the, national, god, of, the, israelite, kingdoms, of, israel, and, judah, and, later, the, god, of, judaism, and, its, other, descendant, abrahamic, religions, though, no, consensus, exists, regarding, the, deity, s, origins, scholars, generally, contend, that, yahweh, is, associated, with, seir, edom, paran, and, teman, and, later, with, canaan, the, origins, of, his, worship, reach, at, least, to, the, early, iron, age, and, likely, to, the, late, bronze, age, if, not, somewhat, earlier, in, the, oldest, biblical, literature, he, possesses, attributes, typically, ascribed, to, weather, and, war, deities, fructifying, the, land, and, leading, the, heavenly, army, against, israel, s, enemies, the, early, israelites, were, polytheistic, and, worshipped, yahweh, alongside, a, variety, of, canaanite, gods, and, goddesses, including, el, asherah, and, baal, in, later, centuries, el, and, yahweh, became, conflated, and, el, linked, epithets, such, as, el, shaddai, came, to, be, applied, to, yahweh, alone, some, scholars, believe, el, and, yahweh, were, always, conflated, characteristics, of, other, gods, such, as, asherah, and, baal, were, also, selectively, absorbed, in, conceptions, of, yahweh, over, time, the, existence, of, other, gods, was, denied, and, yahweh, was, proclaimed, the, creator, deity, and, sole, divinity, to, be, worshipped, during, the, second, temple, period, speaking, the, name, of, yahweh, in, public, became, regarded, as, taboo, and, jews, instead, began, to, substitute, other, words, primarily, adonai, my, lords, in, roman, times, following, the, siege, of, jerusalem, and, destruction, of, its, temple, in, 70, ce, the, original, pronunciation, of, the, god, s, name, was, forgotten, entirely, yahweh, is, also, invoked, in, papyrus, amherst, 63, and, in, jewish, or, jewish, influenced, greco, egyptian, magical, texts, from, the, 1st, to, 5th, century, ce, the, god, s, name, was, written, in, paleo, hebrew, as, in, block, script, transliterated, as, yhwh, modern, scholarship, has, reached, consensus, to, transcribe, this, as, yahweh, the, shortened, forms, yeho, yahu, and, yo, appear, in, personal, names, and, in, phrases, such, as, hallelu, jah, the, sacrality, of, the, name, as, well, as, the, commandment, against, taking, the, name, in, vain, led, to, increasingly, strict, prohibitions, on, speaking, or, writing, the, term, rabbinic, sources, suggest, that, by, the, second, temple, period, the, name, of, god, was, pronounced, only, once, a, year, by, the, high, priest, on, the, day, of, atonement, after, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, in, 70, ce, the, original, pronunciation, of, the, name, was, forgotten, entirely, philip, king, and, lawrence, stager, place, the, history, of, yahweh, into, the, following, periods, other, academic, terms, often, used, include, first, temple, period, from, the, construction, of, the, temple, in, 957, bce, to, its, destruction, in, 586, bce, exilic, for, the, period, of, the, exile, from, 586, 539, bce, identical, with, neo, babylonian, above, post, exilic, for, later, periods, and, second, temple, period, from, the, reconstruction, of, the, temple, in, 515, bce, until, its, destruction, in, 70, ce, there, is, almost, no, agreement, on, yahweh, s, origins, his, name, is, not, attested, other, than, among, the, israelites, and, there, is, no, consensus, on, its, etymology, with, ehyeh, a, er, ehyeh, i, am, that, i, am, the, explanation, presented, in, exodus, 3, 14, appearing, to, be, a, late, theological, gloss, invented, at, a, time, when, the, original, meaning, had, been, forgotten, although, some, scholars, dispute, this, lewis, connects, the, name, to, the, amorite, element, yahwi, ia, wi, found, in, personal, names, in, mari, texts, meaning, brings, to, life, causes, to, exist, e, g, yahwi, dagan, dagon, causes, to, exist, commonly, denoted, as, the, semantic, equivalent, of, the, akkadian, iba, i, dn, though, frank, moore, cross, emphasized, that, the, amorite, verbal, form, is, of, interest, only, in, attempting, to, reconstruct, the, verbal, root, of, the, name, yahweh, and, that, attempts, to, take, yahwi, as, a, divine, epithet, should, be, vigorously, argued, against, in, addition, j, philip, hyatt, believes, it, is, more, likely, that, yahwi, refers, to, a, god, creating, and, sustaining, the, life, of, a, newborn, child, rather, than, the, universe, this, conception, of, god, was, more, popular, among, ancient, near, easterners, but, eventually, the, israelites, removed, the, association, of, yahwi, to, any, human, ancestor, and, combined, it, with, other, elements, e, g, yahweh, hillel, ben, sasson, states, there, is, insufficient, evidence, for, amorites, using, yahwi, for, gods, but, he, argues, that, it, mirrors, other, theophoric, names, and, that, yahwi, or, more, accurately, yawi, derives, from, the, root, hwy, in, pa, al, which, means, he, will, be, one, scholarly, theory, is, that, yahweh, originated, in, a, shortened, form, of, el, yahw, aba, t, el, who, creates, the, hosts, which, cross, considered, to, be, one, of, the, cultic, names, of, el, however, this, phrase, is, nowhere, attested, either, inside, or, outside, the, bible, and, the, two, gods, are, in, any, case, quite, dissimilar, with, el, being, elderly, and, paternal, and, lacking, yahweh, s, association, with, the, storm, and, battles, even, if, the, above, issues, are, resolved, yahweh, is, generally, agreed, to, have, a, non, causative, etymology, because, otherwise, yhwh, would, be, translated, as, yhyh, it, also, raises, the, question, of, why, the, israelites, would, want, to, shorten, the, epithet, one, possible, reason, includes, the, co, existence, of, religious, modernism, and, conservatism, being, the, norm, in, all, religions, the, oldest, plausible, occurrence, of, yahweh, s, name, is, in, the, egyptian, demonym, t, sw, yhw, yhwa, in, the, land, of, the, shasu, egyptian, yhw, in, an, inscription, from, the, time, of, amenhotep, iii, 1390, 1352, bce, the, shasu, being, nomads, from, midian, and, edom, in, northern, arabia, although, it, is, still, uncertain, whether, a, relationship, exists, between, the, toponym, yhw, and, theonym, yhwh, the, dominant, view, is, that, yahweh, was, from, the, southern, region, associated, with, seir, edom, paran, and, teman, there, is, considerable, although, not, universal, support, for, this, view, but, it, raises, the, question, of, how, yahweh, made, his, way, to, the, north, an, answer, many, scholars, consider, plausible, is, the, kenite, hypothesis, which, holds, that, traders, brought, yahweh, to, israel, along, the, caravan, routes, between, egypt, and, canaan, this, ties, together, various, points, of, data, such, as, the, absence, of, yahweh, from, canaan, his, links, with, edom, and, midian, in, the, biblical, stories, and, the, kenite, or, midianite, ties, of, moses, but, its, major, weaknesses, are, that, the, majority, of, israelites, were, firmly, rooted, in, palestine, while, the, historical, role, of, moses, is, problematic, it, follows, that, if, the, kenite, hypothesis, is, to, be, maintained, then, it, must, be, assumed, that, the, israelites, encountered, yahweh, and, the, midianites, kenites, inside, israel, and, through, their, association, with, the, earliest, political, leaders, of, israel, christian, frevel, argues, that, inscriptions, allegedly, suggesting, yahweh, s, southern, origins, e, g, yhwh, of, teman, may, simply, denote, his, presence, there, at, later, times, and, that, teman, can, refer, to, any, southern, territory, including, judah, alternatively, some, scholars, argue, that, yhwh, worship, was, rooted, in, the, indigenous, culture, of, the, kingdom, of, israel, and, was, promoted, in, the, kingdom, of, judah, by, the, omrides, frevel, suggests, that, hazael, s, conquests, in, the, kingdom, of, israel, forced, the, two, kingdoms, to, cooperate, which, spread, yhwh, worship, among, judean, commoners, previously, yhwh, was, viewed, as, the, patron, god, of, the, judean, state, in, the, early, iron, age, the, modern, consensus, is, that, there, was, no, distinction, in, language, or, material, culture, between, canaanites, and, israelites, scholars, accordingly, define, israelite, culture, as, a, subset, of, canaanite, culture, in, this, view, the, israelite, religion, consisted, of, canaanite, gods, such, as, el, the, ruler, of, the, pantheon, asherah, his, consort, and, baal, however, israel, knohl, argues, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, anthropomorphic, figurines, or, cultic, statues, in, israel, during, this, period, suggesting, monotheistic, practice, in, the, earliest, biblical, literature, yahweh, has, characteristics, of, a, storm, god, typical, of, ancient, near, eastern, myths, marching, out, from, edom, or, the, sinai, desert, with, the, heavenly, host, of, stars, and, planets, that, make, up, his, army, to, do, battle, with, the, enemies, of, his, people, israel, yahweh, when, you, went, out, of, seir, when, you, marched, out, of, the, field, of, edom, the, earth, trembled, the, sky, also, dropped, yes, the, clouds, dropped, water, the, mountains, quaked, at, yahweh, s, presence, even, sinai, at, the, presence, of, yahweh, the, god, of, israel, from, the, sky, the, stars, fought, from, their, courses, they, fought, against, sisera, book, of, judges, 5, 4, 5, 20, web, world, english, bible, the, song, of, deborah, alternatively, parts, of, the, storm, god, imagery, could, derive, from, baal, 78, from, the, perspective, of, the, kenite, hypothesis, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, edomite, deity, q, s, might, have, been, one, and, the, same, as, yahweh, rather, than, a, separate, deity, with, its, name, a, title, of, the, latter, aside, from, their, common, territorial, origins, various, common, characteristics, between, the, yahwist, cult, and, the, edomite, cult, of, q, s, hint, at, a, shared, connection, doeg, the, edomite, for, example, is, depicted, as, having, no, problem, in, worshiping, yahweh, and, is, shown, to, be, at, home, in, jewish, sanctuaries, unlike, the, chief, god, of, the, ammonites, milcom, and, the, moabites, chemosh, the, tanakh, refrains, from, explicitly, naming, the, edomite, q, s, some, scholars, have, explained, this, notable, omission, by, assuming, that, the, level, of, similarity, between, yahweh, and, q, s, would, have, made, rejection, of, the, latter, difficult, other, scholars, hold, that, yahweh, and, q, s, were, different, deities, from, their, origins, and, suggest, that, the, tensions, between, judeans, and, edomites, during, the, second, temple, period, may, lie, behind, the, omission, of, q, s, in, the, bible, it, has, been, argued, that, yahweh, was, originally, described, as, one, of, the, sons, of, el, in, deuteronomy, 32, 8, 9, and, that, this, was, removed, by, a, later, emendation, to, the, text, nonetheless, some, scholars, argue, that, el, elyon, the, most, high, and, yahweh, are, theonyms, for, the, same, deity, in, the, text, based, on, contextual, analysis, when, the, most, high, gave, the, nations, their, inheritance, when, he, divided, up, humankind, he, set, the, boundaries, of, the, peoples, according, to, the, number, of, the, heavenly, assembly, for, the, lord, s, allotment, is, his, people, jacob, is, his, special, possession, book, of, deuteronomy, 32, 8, 9, new, english, translation, song, of, moses, the, late, iron, age, saw, the, emergence, of, nation, states, associated, with, specific, national, gods, chemosh, was, the, god, of, the, moabites, milcom, the, god, of, the, ammonites, q, s, the, god, of, the, edomites, and, yahweh, the, god, of, the, israelites, in, each, kingdom, the, king, was, also, the, head, of, the, national, religion, and, thus, the, viceroy, on, earth, of, the, national, god, yahweh, filled, the, role, of, national, god, in, the, kingdom, of, israel, samaria, which, emerged, in, the, 10th, century, bce, and, also, in, judah, which, may, have, emerged, a, century, later, no, god, of, judah, is, mentioned, anywhere, in, the, bible, during, the, reign, of, ahab, and, particularly, following, his, marriage, to, jezebel, baal, may, have, briefly, replaced, yahweh, as, the, national, god, of, israel, but, not, judah, in, the, 9th, century, bce, there, are, indications, of, rejection, of, baal, worship, associated, with, the, prophets, elijah, and, elisha, the, yahweh, religion, thus, began, to, separate, itself, from, its, canaanite, heritage, this, process, continued, over, the, period, from, 800, to, 500, bce, with, legal, and, prophetic, condemnations, of, the, asherim, sun, worship, and, worship, on, the, high, places, along, with, practices, pertaining, to, the, dead, and, other, aspects, of, the, old, religion, features, of, baal, el, and, asherah, were, absorbed, into, yahweh, and, epithets, such, as, el, shaddai, came, to, be, applied, to, yahweh, alone, in, this, atmosphere, a, struggle, emerged, between, those, who, believed, that, yahweh, alone, should, be, worshipped, and, those, who, worshipped, him, within, a, larger, group, of, gods, the, yahweh, alone, party, the, party, of, the, prophets, and, deuteronomists, ultimately, triumphed, and, their, victory, lies, behind, the, biblical, narrative, of, an, israel, vacillating, between, periods, of, following, other, gods, and, periods, of, fidelity, to, yahweh, some, scholars, date, the, start, of, widespread, monotheism, to, the, 8th, century, bce, and, view, it, as, a, response, to, neo, assyrian, aggression, in, an, inscription, discovered, in, ein, gedi, and, dated, around, 700, bce, yahweh, appears, described, as, the, lord, of, the, nations, while, in, other, contemporary, texts, discovered, in, khirbet, beit, lei, near, lachish, he, is, mentioned, as, the, ruler, of, jerusalem, and, probably, also, of, judah, in, 587, 6, bce, jerusalem, fell, to, the, neo, babylonians, solomon, s, temple, was, destroyed, and, the, leadership, of, the, community, were, deported, the, next, 50, years, the, babylonian, exile, were, of, pivotal, importance, to, the, history, of, israelite, religion, as, the, traditional, sacrifices, to, yahweh, see, below, could, not, be, performed, outside, israel, other, practices, including, sabbath, observance, and, circumcision, gained, new, significance, in, the, writing, of, second, isaiah, yahweh, was, no, longer, seen, as, exclusive, to, israel, but, as, extending, his, promise, to, all, who, would, keep, the, sabbath, and, observe, his, covenant, in, 539, bce, babylon, in, turn, fell, to, the, persian, conqueror, cyrus, the, great, the, exiles, were, given, permission, to, return, although, only, a, minority, did, so, and, by, about, 500, bce, the, second, temple, was, built, towards, the, end, of, the, second, temple, period, speaking, the, name, of, yahweh, in, public, became, regarded, as, taboo, when, reading, from, the, scriptures, jews, began, to, substitute, the, divine, name, with, the, word, adonai, meaning, my, lord, the, high, priest, of, israel, was, permitted, to, speak, the, name, once, in, the, temple, during, the, day, of, atonement, but, at, no, other, time, and, in, no, other, place, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, scriptures, were, translated, into, greek, by, the, jews, of, the, egyptian, diaspora, greek, translations, of, the, hebrew, scriptures, render, both, the, tetragrammaton, and, adonai, as, kyrios, meaning, lord, the, period, of, persian, rule, saw, the, development, of, expectation, in, a, future, human, king, who, would, rule, purified, israel, as, yahweh, s, representative, at, the, end, of, time, a, messiah, the, first, to, mention, this, were, haggai, and, zechariah, both, prophets, of, the, early, persian, period, they, saw, the, messiah, in, zerubbabel, a, descendant, of, the, house, of, david, who, seemed, briefly, to, be, about, to, re, establish, the, ancient, royal, line, or, in, zerubbabel, and, the, first, high, priest, joshua, zechariah, writes, of, two, messiahs, one, royal, and, the, other, priestly, these, early, hopes, were, dashed, zerubabbel, disappeared, from, the, historical, record, although, the, high, priests, continued, to, be, descended, from, joshua, and, thereafter, there, are, merely, general, references, to, a, messiah, of, david, i, e, a, descendant, from, these, ideas, second, temple, judaism, would, later, emerge, whence, christianity, rabbinic, judaism, and, islam, although, the, specific, process, by, which, the, israelites, adopted, monotheism, is, unknown, the, transition, was, a, gradual, one, and, was, not, totally, accomplished, during, the, first, temple, period, it, is, unclear, when, the, worship, of, yahweh, alone, began, the, earliest, known, portrayals, of, yahweh, as, the, principal, deity, to, whom, one, owed, the, powers, of, blessing, the, land, appear, in, the, teachings, of, the, prophet, elijah, in, the, 9th, century, bce, this, form, of, worship, was, likely, well, established, by, the, time, of, the, prophet, hosea, in, the, 8th, century, bce, in, reference, to, disputes, between, yahweh, and, baal, the, early, supporters, of, this, faction, are, widely, regarded, as, being, monolatrists, rather, than, true, monotheists, they, did, not, believe, yahweh, was, the, only, god, in, existence, but, instead, believed, that, he, was, the, only, god, which, the, people, of, israel, should, worship, finally, in, the, national, crisis, of, the, babylonian, exile, the, followers, of, yahweh, went, a, step, further, and, outright, denied, that, the, other, deities, aside, from, yahweh, even, existed, thus, marking, the, transition, from, monolatrism, to, true, monotheism, the, notion, that, yahweh, is, to, be, worshipped, as, the, creator, god, of, all, the, earth, is, first, elaborated, by, the, second, isaiah, a, 6th, century, bce, exilic, work, whose, case, for, the, theological, doctrine, rests, on, yahweh, s, power, over, other, gods, and, his, incomparability, and, singleness, relative, to, the, gods, of, the, babylonian, religion, benjamin, d, sommer, argues, that, the, distinction, between, polytheism, and, monotheism, has, been, greatly, exaggerated, the, centre, of, yahweh, s, worship, lay, in, three, great, annual, festivals, coinciding, with, major, events, in, rural, life, passover, with, the, birthing, of, lambs, shavuot, with, the, cereal, harvest, and, sukkot, with, the, fruit, harvest, these, probably, pre, dated, the, arrival, of, the, yahweh, religion, but, they, became, linked, to, events, in, the, national, mythos, of, israel, passover, with, the, exodus, from, egypt, shavuot, with, the, law, giving, at, mount, sinai, and, sukkot, with, the, wilderness, wanderings, the, festivals, thus, celebrated, yahweh, s, salvation, of, israel, and, israel, s, status, as, his, holy, people, although, the, earlier, agricultural, meaning, was, not, entirely, lost, his, worship, presumably, involved, sacrifice, but, many, scholars, have, concluded, that, the, rituals, detailed, in, leviticus, 1, 16, with, their, stress, on, purity, and, atonement, were, introduced, only, after, the, babylonian, exile, and, that, in, reality, any, head, of, a, family, was, able, to, offer, sacrifice, as, occasion, demanded, a, number, of, scholars, have, also, drawn, the, conclusion, that, infant, sacrifice, whether, to, the, underworld, deity, molech, or, to, yahweh, himself, was, a, part, of, israelite, judahite, religion, until, the, reforms, of, king, josiah, in, the, late, 7th, century, bce, sacrifice, was, presumably, complemented, by, the, singing, or, recital, of, psalms, but, again, the, details, are, scant, prayer, played, little, role, in, official, worship, the, hebrew, bible, gives, the, impression, that, the, jerusalem, temple, was, always, meant, to, be, the, central, or, even, sole, temple, of, yahweh, but, this, was, not, the, case, the, earliest, known, israelite, place, of, worship, is, a, 12th, century, bce, open, air, altar, in, the, hills, of, samaria, featuring, a, bronze, bull, reminiscent, of, canaanite, bull, el, el, in, the, form, of, a, bull, and, the, archaeological, remains, of, further, temples, have, been, found, at, dan, on, israel, s, northern, border, at, arad, in, the, negev, and, beersheba, both, in, the, territory, of, judah, shiloh, bethel, gilgal, mizpah, ramah, and, dan, were, also, major, sites, for, festivals, sacrifices, the, making, of, vows, private, rituals, and, the, adjudication, of, legal, disputes, yahweh, worship, was, famously, aniconic, meaning, that, the, god, was, not, depicted, by, a, statue, or, other, image, this, is, not, to, say, that, he, was, not, represented, in, some, symbolic, form, and, early, israelite, worship, probably, focused, on, standing, stones, but, according, to, the, biblical, texts, the, temple, in, jerusalem, featured, yahweh, s, throne, in, the, form, of, two, cherubim, their, inner, wings, forming, the, seat, and, a, box, the, ark, of, the, covenant, as, a, footstool, while, the, throne, itself, was, empty, there, is, no, universally, accepted, explanation, for, such, aniconism, and, a, number, of, scholars, have, argued, that, yahweh, was, in, fact, represented, prior, to, the, reforms, of, hezekiah, and, josiah, late, in, the, monarchic, period, to, quote, one, study, n, early, aniconism, de, facto, or, otherwise, is, purely, a, projection, of, the, post, exilic, imagination, other, scholars, argue, that, there, is, no, certain, evidence, of, any, anthropomorphic, representation, of, yahweh, during, the, pre, exilic, period, yahweh, is, frequently, invoked, in, graeco, roman, magical, texts, dating, from, the, 2nd, century, bce, to, the, 5th, century, ce, most, notably, in, the, greek, magical, papyri, under, the, names, iao, adonai, sabaoth, and, eloai, in, these, texts, he, is, often, mentioned, alongside, traditional, graeco, roman, deities, and, egyptian, deities, the, archangels, michael, gabriel, raphael, and, ouriel, and, jewish, cultural, heroes, such, as, abraham, jacob, and, moses, are, also, invoked, frequently, the, frequent, occurrence, of, yahweh, s, name, was, likely, due, to, greek, and, roman, folk, magicians, seeking, to, make, their, spells, more, powerful, through, the, invocation, of, a, prestigious, foreign, deity, a, coin, issued, by, pompey, to, celebrate, his, successful, conquest, of, judaea, showed, a, kneeling, bearded, figure, grasping, a, branch, a, common, roman, symbol, of, submission, subtitled, bacchivs, ivdaevs, which, may, be, translated, as, either, the, jewish, bacchus, or, bacchus, the, judaean, the, figure, has, been, interpreted, as, depicting, yahweh, as, a, local, variety, of, bacchus, that, is, dionysus, however, as, coins, minted, with, such, iconography, ordinarily, depicted, subjected, persons, and, not, the, gods, of, a, subjected, people, some, have, assumed, the, coin, simply, depicts, the, surrender, of, a, judean, who, was, called, bacchius, sometimes, identified, as, the, hasmonean, king, aristobulus, ii, who, was, overthrown, by, pompey, s, campaign, in, any, event, tacitus, john, the, lydian, cornelius, labeo, and, marcus, terentius, varro, similarly, identify, yahweh, with, bacchus, dionysus, jews, themselves, frequently, used, symbols, that, were, also, associated, with, dionysus, such, as, kylixes, amphorae, leaves, of, ivy, and, clusters, of, grapes, a, similarity, plutarch, used, to, argue, that, jews, worshipped, a, hypostasized, form, of, bacchus, dionysus, in, his, quaestiones, convivales, plutarch, further, notes, that, the, jews, hail, their, god, with, cries, of, euoi, and, sabi, phrases, associated, with, the, worship, of, dionysus, according, to, sean, m, mcdonough, greek, speakers, may, have, confused, aramaic, words, such, as, sabbath, alleluia, or, even, possibly, some, variant, of, the, name, yahweh, itself, for, more, familiar, terms, associated, with, dionysus, other, roman, writers, such, as, juvenal, petronius, and, florus, identified, yahweh, with, the, god, caelus
