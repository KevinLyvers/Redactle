transformation, supported, by, various, practices, and, experiences, the, term, mysticism, has, ancient, greek, origins, with, various, historically, determined, meanings, derived, from, the, greek, word, m, meaning, to, close, or, to, conceal, mysticism, referred, to, the, biblical, liturgical, spiritual, and, contemplative, dimensions, of, early, and, medieval, christianity, during, the, early, modern, period, the, definition, of, mysticism, grew, to, include, a, broad, range, of, beliefs, and, ideologies, related, to, extraordinary, experiences, and, states, of, mind, in, modern, times, mysticism, has, acquired, a, limited, definition, with, broad, applications, as, meaning, the, aim, at, the, union, with, the, absolute, the, infinite, or, god, this, limited, definition, has, been, applied, to, a, wide, range, of, religious, traditions, and, practices, valuing, mystical, experience, as, a, key, element, of, mysticism, since, the, 1960s, scholars, have, debated, the, merits, of, perennial, and, constructionist, approaches, in, the, scientific, research, of, mystical, experiences, the, perennial, position, is, now, largely, dismissed, by, scholars, most, scholars, using, a, contextualist, approach, which, considers, the, cultural, and, historical, context, mysticism, is, derived, from, the, greek, meaning, i, conceal, and, its, derivative, mystikos, meaning, an, initiate, the, verb, has, received, a, quite, different, meaning, in, the, greek, language, where, it, is, still, in, use, the, primary, meanings, it, has, are, induct, and, initiate, secondary,

mystery, revelation, the, meaning, derives, from, the, initiatory, rites, of, the, pagan, mysteries, also, appearing, in, the, new, testament, is, the, related, noun, must, rion, or, myst, rion, the, root, word, of, the, english, term, mystery, the, term, means, anything, hidden, a, mystery, or, secret, of, which, initiation, is, necessary, in, the, new, testament, it, reportedly, takes, the, meaning, of, the, counsels, of, god, once, hidden, but, now, revealed, in, the, gospel, or, some, fact, thereof, the, christian, revelation, generally, and, or, particular, truths, or, details, of, the, christian, revelation, according, to, thayer, s, greek, lexicon, the, term, in, classical, greek, meant, a, hidden, thing, secret, a, particular, meaning, it, took, in, classical, antiquity, was, a, religious, secret, or, religious, secrets, confided, only, to, the, initiated, and, not, to, be, communicated, by, them, to, ordinary, mortals, in, the, septuagint, and, the, new, testament, the,

ancient, greek, texts, to, mean, the, person, or, persons, initiated, to, religious, mysteries, these, followers, of, mystery, religions, belonged, to, a, select, group, where, access, was, only, gained, through, an, initiation, she, finds, that, the, terms, were, associated, with, the, term, bacchus, which, was, used, for, a, special, class, of, initiates, of, the, orphic, mysteries, the, terms, are, first, found, connected, in, the, writings, of, heraclitus, such, initiates, are, identified, in, texts, with, the, persons, who, have, been, purified, and, have, performed, certain, rites, a, passage, of, cretans, by, euripides, seems, to, explain, that, the, initiate, who, devotes, himself, to, an, ascetic, life, renounces, sexual, activities, and, avoids, contact, with, the, dead, becomes, known, as, such, initiates, were, believers, in, the, god, dionysus, bacchus, who, took, on, the, name, of, their, god, and, sought, an, identification, with, their, deity, until, the, sixth, century, the, practice, of, what, is, now, called, mysticism, was, referred, to, by, the, term, contemplatio, c, q, theoria, according, to, johnston, oth, contemplation, and, mysticism, speak, of, the, eye, of, love, which, is, looking, at, gazing, at, aware, of, divine, realities, according, to, peter, moore, the, term, mysticism, is, problematic, but, indispensable, it, is, a, generic, term, which, joins, together, into, one, concept, separate, practices, and, ideas, which, developed, separately, according, to, dupr, mysticism, has, been, defined, in, many, ways, and, merkur, notes, that, the, definition, or, meaning, of, the, term, mysticism, has, changed, through, the, ages, moore, further, notes, that, the, term, mysticism, has, become, a, popular, label, for, anything, nebulous, esoteric, occult, or, supernatural, parsons, warns, that, what, might, at, times, seem, to, be, a, straightforward, phenomenon, exhibiting, an, unambiguous, commonality, has, become, at, least, within, the, academic, study, of, religion, opaque, and, controversial, on, multiple, levels, because, of, its, christian, overtones, and, the, lack, of, similar, terms, in, other, cultures, some, scholars, regard, the, term, mysticism, to, be, inadequate, as, a, useful, descriptive, term, other, scholars, regard, the, term, to, be, an, inauthentic, fabrication, the, product, of, post, enlightenment, universalism, deriving, from, neo, platonism, and, henosis, mysticism, is, popularly, known, as, union, with, god, or, the, absolute, in, the, 13th, century, the, term, unio, mystica, came, to, be, used, to, refer, to, the, spiritual, marriage, the, ecstasy, or, rapture, that, was, experienced, when, prayer, was, used, to, contemplate, both, god, s, omnipresence, in, the, world, and, god, in, his, essence, in, the, 19th, century, under, the, influence, of, romanticism, this, union, was, interpreted, as, a, religious, experience, which, provides, certainty, about, god, or, a, transcendental, reality, an, influential, proponent, of, this, understanding, was, william, james, 1842, 1910, who, stated, that, in, mystic, states, we, both, become, one, with, the, absolute, and, we, become, aware, of, our, oneness, william, james, popularized, this, use, of, the, term, religious, experience, in, his, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, contributing, to, the, interpretation, of, mysticism, as, a, distinctive, experience, comparable, to, sensory, experiences, religious, experiences, belonged, to, the, personal, religion, which, he, considered, to, be, more, fundamental, than, either, theology, or, ecclesiasticism, he, gave, a, perennialist, interpretation, to, religious, experience, stating, that, this, kind, of, experience, is, ultimately, uniform, in, various, traditions, mcginn, notes, that, the, term, unio, mystica, although, it, has, christian, origins, is, primarily, a, modern, expression, mcginn, argues, that, presence, is, more, accurate, than, union, since, not, all, mystics, spoke, of, union, with, god, and, since, many, visions, and, miracles, were, not, necessarily, related, to, union, he, also, argues, that, we, should, speak, of, consciousness, of, god, s, presence, rather, than, of, experience, since, mystical, activity, is, not, simply, about, the, sensation, of, god, as, an, external, object, but, more, broadly, about, new, ways, of, knowing, and, loving, based, on, states, of, awareness, in, which, god, becomes, present, in, our, inner, acts, however, the, idea, of, union, does, not, work, in, all, contexts, for, example, in, advaita, vedanta, there, is, only, one, reality, brahman, and, therefore, nothing, other, than, reality, to, unite, with, it, brahman, in, each, person, atman, has, always, in, fact, been, identical, to, brahman, all, along, dan, merkur, also, notes, that, union, with, god, or, the, absolute, is, a, too, limited, definition, since, there, are, also, traditions, which, aim, not, at, a, sense, of, unity, but, of, nothingness, such, as, pseudo, dionysius, the, areopagite, and, meister, eckhart, according, to, merkur, kabbala, and, buddhism, also, emphasize, nothingness, blakemore, and, jennett, note, that, definitions, of, mysticism, are, often, imprecise, they, further, note, that, this, kind, of, interpretation, and, definition, is, a, recent, development, which, has, become, the, standard, definition, and, understanding, according, to, gelman, a, unitive, experience, involves, a, phenomenological, de, emphasis, blurring, or, eradication, of, multiplicity, where, the, cognitive, significance, of, the, experience, is, deemed, to, lie, precisely, in, that, phenomenological, feature, mysticism, involves, an, explanatory, context, which, provides, meaning, for, mystical, and, visionary, experiences, and, related, experiences, like, trances, according, to, dan, merkur, mysticism, may, relate, to, any, kind, of, ecstasy, or, altered, state, of, consciousness, and, the, ideas, and, explanations, related, to, them, parsons, stresses, the, importance, of, distinguishing, between, temporary, experiences, and, mysticism, as, a, process, which, is, embodied, within, a, religious, matrix, of, texts, and, practices, richard, jones, does, the, same, peter, moore, notes, that, mystical, experience, may, also, happen, in, a, spontaneous, and, natural, way, to, people, who, are, not, committed, to, any, religious, tradition, these, experiences, are, not, necessarily, interpreted, in, a, religious, framework, ann, taves, asks, by, which, processes, experiences, are, set, apart, and, deemed, religious, or, mystical, some, authors, emphasize, that, mystical, experience, involves, intuitive, understanding, of, the, meaning, of, existence, and, of, hidden, truths, and, the, resolution, of, life, problems, according, to, larson, mystical, experience, is, an, intuitive, understanding, and, realization, of, the, meaning, of, existence, according, to, mcclenon, mysticism, is, the, doctrine, that, special, mental, states, or, events, allow, an, understanding, of, ultimate, truths, according, to, james, r, horne, mystical, illumination, is, a, central, visionary, experience, that, results, in, the, resolution, of, a, personal, or, religious, problem, according, to, evelyn, underhill, illumination, is, a, generic, english, term, for, the, phenomenon, of, mysticism, the, term, illumination, is, derived, from, the, latin, illuminatio, applied, to, christian, prayer, in, the, 15th, century, comparable, asian, terms, are, bodhi, kensho, and, satori, in, buddhism, commonly, translated, as, enlightenment, and, vipassana, which, all, point, to, cognitive, processes, of, intuition, and, comprehension, other, authors, point, out, that, mysticism, involves, more, than, mystical, experience, according, to, gellmann, the, ultimate, goal, of, mysticism, is, human, transformation, not, just, experiencing, mystical, or, visionary, states, according, to, mcginn, personal, transformation, is, the, essential, criterion, to, determine, the, authenticity, of, christian, mysticism, in, the, hellenistic, world, mystical, referred, to, secret, religious, rituals, like, the, eleusinian, mysteries, the, use, of, the, word, lacked, any, direct, references, to, the, transcendental, a, mystikos, was, an, initiate, of, a, mystery, religion, in, early, christianity, the, term, mystikos, referred, to, three, dimensions, which, soon, became, intertwined, namely, the, biblical, the, liturgical, and, the, spiritual, or, contemplative, the, biblical, dimension, refers, to, hidden, or, allegorical, interpretations, of, scriptures, the, liturgical, dimension, refers, to, the, liturgical, mystery, of, the, eucharist, the, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, the, third, dimension, is, the, contemplative, or, experiential, knowledge, of, god, until, the, sixth, century, the, greek, term, theoria, meaning, contemplation, in, latin, was, used, for, the, mystical, interpretation, of, the, bible, and, the, vision, of, god, the, link, between, mysticism, and, the, vision, of, the, divine, was, introduced, by, the, early, church, fathers, who, used, the, term, as, an, adjective, as, in, mystical, theology, and, mystical, contemplation, theoria, enabled, the, fathers, to, perceive, depths, of, meaning, in, the, biblical, writings, that, escape, a, purely, scientific, or, empirical, approach, to, interpretation, the, antiochene, fathers, in, particular, saw, in, every, passage, of, scripture, a, double, meaning, both, literal, and, spiritual, later, theoria, or, contemplation, came, to, be, distinguished, from, intellectual, life, leading, to, the, identification, of, or, contemplatio, with, a, form, of, prayer, distinguished, from, discursive, meditation, in, both, east, and, west, this, threefold, meaning, of, mystical, continued, in, the, middle, ages, according, to, dan, merkur, the, term, unio, mystica, came, into, use, in, the, 13th, century, as, a, synonym, for, the, spiritual, marriage, the, ecstasy, or, rapture, that, was, experienced, when, prayer, was, used, to, contemplate, both, god, s, omnipresence, in, the, world, and, god, in, his, essence, under, the, influence, of, pseudo, dionysius, the, areopagite, the, mystical, theology, came, to, denote, the, investigation, of, the, allegorical, truth, of, the, bible, and, the, spiritual, awareness, of, the, ineffable, absolute, beyond, the, theology, of, divine, names, pseudo, dionysius, apophatic, theology, or, negative, theology, exerted, a, great, influence, on, medieval, monastic, religiosity, although, it, was, mostly, a, male, religiosity, since, women, were, not, allowed, to, study, it, was, influenced, by, neo, platonism, and, very, influential, in, eastern, orthodox, christian, theology, in, western, christianity, it, was, a, counter, current, to, the, prevailing, cataphatic, theology, or, positive, theology, mysticism, was, also, manifested, in, various, sects, of, the, time, such, as, the, waldensians, in, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, century, mysticism, came, to, be, used, as, a, substantive, this, shift, was, linked, to, a, new, discourse, in, which, science, and, religion, were, separated, luther, dismissed, the, allegorical, interpretation, of, the, bible, and, condemned, mystical, theology, which, he, saw, as, more, platonic, than, christian, the, mystical, as, the, search, for, the, hidden, meaning, of, texts, became, secularised, and, also, associated, with, literature, as, opposed, to, science, and, prose, science, was, also, distinguished, from, religion, by, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, the, mystical, is, increasingly, applied, exclusively, to, the, religious, realm, separating, religion, and, natural, philosophy, as, two, distinct, approaches, to, the, discovery, of, the, hidden, meaning, of, the, universe, the, traditional, hagiographies, and, writings, of, the, saints, became, designated, as, mystical, shifting, from, the, virtues, and, miracles, to, extraordinary, experiences, and, states, of, mind, thereby, creating, a, newly, coined, mystical, tradition, a, new, understanding, developed, of, the, divine, as, residing, within, human, an, essence, beyond, the, varieties, of, religious, expressions, the, 19th, century, saw, a, growing, emphasis, on, individual, experience, as, a, defense, against, the, growing, rationalism, of, western, society, the, meaning, of, mysticism, was, considerably, narrowed, the, competition, between, the, perspectives, of, theology, and, science, resulted, in, a, compromise, in, which, most, varieties, of, what, had, traditionally, been, called, mysticism, were, dismissed, as, merely, psychological, phenomena, and, only, one, variety, which, aimed, at, union, with, the, absolute, the, infinite, or, god, and, thereby, the, perception, of, its, essential, unity, or, oneness, was, claimed, to, be, genuinely, mystical, the, historical, evidence, however, does, not, support, such, a, narrow, conception, of, mysticism, under, the, influence, of, perennialism, which, was, popularised, in, both, the, west, and, the, east, by, unitarianism, transcendentalists, and, theosophy, mysticism, has, been, applied, to, a, broad, spectrum, of, religious, traditions, in, which, all, sorts, of, esotericism, religious, traditions, and, practices, are, joined, together, the, term, mysticism, was, extended, to, comparable, phenomena, in, non, christian, religions, where, it, influenced, hindu, and, buddhist, responses, to, colonialism, resulting, in, neo, vedanta, and, buddhist, modernism, in, the, contemporary, usage, mysticism, has, become, an, umbrella, term, for, all, sorts, of, non, rational, world, views, parapsychology, and, pseudoscience, william, harmless, even, states, that, mysticism, has, become, a, catch, all, for, religious, weirdness, within, the, academic, study, of, religion, the, apparent, unambiguous, commonality, has, become, opaque, and, controversial, the, term, mysticism, is, being, used, in, different, ways, in, different, traditions, some, call, to, attention, the, conflation, of, mysticism, and, linked, terms, such, as, spirituality, and, esotericism, and, point, at, the, differences, between, various, traditions, based, on, various, definitions, of, mysticism, namely, mysticism, as, an, experience, of, union, or, nothingness, mysticism, as, any, kind, of, an, altered, state, of, consciousness, which, is, attributed, in, a, religious, way, mysticism, as, enlightenment, or, insight, and, mysticism, as, a, way, of, transformation, mysticism, can, be, found, in, many, cultures, and, religious, traditions, both, in, folk, religion, and, organized, religion, these, traditions, include, practices, to, induce, religious, or, mystical, experiences, but, also, ethical, standards, and, practices, to, enhance, self, control, and, integrate, the, mystical, experience, into, daily, life, dan, merkur, notes, though, that, mystical, practices, are, often, separated, from, daily, religious, practices, and, restricted, to, religious, specialists, like, monastics, priests, and, other, renunciates, according, to, dan, merkur, shamanism, may, be, regarded, as, a, form, of, mysticism, in, which, the, world, of, spirits, is, accessed, through, religious, ecstasy, according, to, mircea, eliade, shamanism, is, a, technique, of, religious, ecstasy, shamanism, involves, a, practitioner, reaching, an, altered, state, of, consciousness, in, order, to, perceive, and, interact, with, spirits, and, channel, transcendental, energies, into, this, world, a, shaman, is, a, person, regarded, as, having, access, to, and, influence, in, the, world, of, benevolent, and, malevolent, spirits, who, typically, enters, into, trance, during, a, ritual, and, practices, divination, and, healing, neoshamanism, refers, to, new, forms, of, shamanism, or, methods, of, seeking, visions, or, healing, typically, practiced, in, western, countries, neoshamanism, comprises, an, eclectic, range, of, beliefs, and, practices, that, involve, attempts, to, attain, altered, states, and, communicate, with, a, spirit, world, and, is, associated, with, new, age, practices, the, eleusinian, mysteries, greek, were, annual, initiation, ceremonies, in, the, cults, of, the, goddesses, demeter, and, persephone, held, in, secret, at, eleusis, near, athens, in, ancient, greece, the, mysteries, began, in, about, 1600, b, c, in, the, mycenean, period, and, continued, for, two, thousand, years, becoming, a, major, festival, during, the, hellenic, era, and, later, spreading, to, rome, numerous, scholars, have, proposed, that, the, power, of, the, eleusinian, mysteries, came, from, the, kykeon, s, functioning, as, an, entheogen, the, apophatic, theology, or, negative, theology, of, pseudo, dionysius,

which, contemplative, prayer, silences, the, mind, to, progress, along, the, path, of, theosis, deification, theosis, practical, unity, with, and, conformity, to, god, is, obtained, by, engaging, in, contemplative, prayer, the, first, stage, of, theoria, which, results, from, the, cultivation, of, watchfulness, nepsis, in, theoria, one, comes, to, behold, the, divisibly, indivisible, divine, operations, energeia, of, god, as, the, uncreated, light, of, transfiguration, a, grace, which, is, eternal, and, proceeds, naturally, from, the, blinding, darkness, of, the, incomprehensible, divine, essence, it, is, the, main, aim, of, hesychasm, which, was, developed, in, the, thought, st, symeon, the, new, theologian, embraced, by, the, monastic, communities, on, mount, athos, and, most, notably, defended, by, st, gregory, palamas, against, the, greek, humanist, philosopher, barlaam, of, calabria, according, to, roman, catholic, critics, hesychastic, practice, has, its, roots, to, the, introduction, of, a, systematic, practical, approach, to, quietism, by, symeon, the, new, theologian, symeon, believed, that, direct, experience, gave, monks, the, authority, to, preach, and, give, absolution, of, sins, without, the, need, for, formal, ordination, while, church, authorities, also, taught, from, a, speculative, and, philosophical, perspective, symeon, taught, from, his, own, direct, mystical, experience, and, met, with, strong, resistance, for, his, charismatic, approach, and, his, support, of, individual, direct, experience, of, god, s, grace, the, high, middle, ages, saw, a, flourishing, of, mystical, practice, and, theorization, in, western, roman, catholicism, corresponding, to, the, flourishing, of, new, monastic, orders, with, such, figures, as, guigo, ii, hildegard, of, bingen, bernard, of, clairvaux, the, victorines, all, coming, from, different, orders, as, well, as, the, first, real, flowering, of, popular, piety, among, the, laypeople, the, late, middle, ages, saw, the, clash, between, the, dominican, and, franciscan, schools, of, thought, which, was, also, a, conflict, between, two, different, mystical, theologies, on, the, one, hand, that, of, dominic, de, guzm, n, and, on, the, other, that, of, francis, of, assisi, anthony, of, padua, bonaventure, and, angela, of, foligno, this, period, also, saw, such, individuals, as, john, of, ruysbroeck, catherine, of, siena, and, catherine, of, genoa, the, devotio, moderna, and, such, books, as, the, theologia, germanica, the, cloud, of, unknowing, and, the, imitation, of, christ,

mysticism, and, kabbalah, the, former, predated, the, latter, and, was, focused, on, visions, particularly, those, mentioned, in, the, book, of, ezekiel, it, gets, its, name, from, the, hebrew, word,

and, charity, pass, the, evil, of, the, decree, but, if, you, already, do, teshuvah, and, pray, with, all, your, heart, and, give, tzedakah, especially, to, support, the, scholars, then, surely, it, is, good, and, right, to, also, add, the, power, of, segulot, to, give, so, to, speak, an, additional, push, to, each, one, to, reach, the, salvation, he, needs, the, consensus, is, that, islam, s, inner, and, mystical, dimension, is, encapsulated, in, sufism, classical, sufi, scholars, have, defined, sufism, as, science, whose, objective, is, the, reparation, of, the, heart, and, turning, it, away, from, all, else, but, god, a, practitioner, of, this, tradition, is, nowadays, known, as, a, f, or, in, earlier, usage, a, dervish, the, origin, of, the, word, sufi, is, ambiguous, one, understanding, is, that, sufi, means, wool, wearer, wool, wearers, during, early, islam, were, pious, ascetics, who, withdrew, from, urban, life, another, explanation, of, the, word, sufi, is, that, it, means, purity, sufis, generally, belong, to, a, halaqa, a, circle, or, group, led, by, a, sheikh, or, murshid, sufi, circles, usually, belong, to, a, tariqa, which, is, the, sufi, order, and,

of, mystics, surrendering, themselves, to, the, lord, s, feet, according, to, paul, oliver, a, lecturer, at, huddersfield, university, buddhism, is, mystical, in, the, sense, that, it, aims, at, the, identification, of, the, true, nature, of, our, self, and, live, according, to, it, buddhism, originated, in, india, sometime, between, the, 6th, and, 4th, centuries, bce, but, is, now, mostly, practiced, in, other, countries, where, it, developed, into, a, number, of, traditions, the, main, ones, being, therevada, mahayana, and, vajrayana, buddhism, aims, at, liberation, from, the, cycle, of, rebirth, by, self, control, through, meditation, and, morally, just, behaviour, some, buddhist, paths, aim, at, a, gradual, development, and, transformation, of, the, personality, toward, nirvana, like, the, theravada, stages, of, enlightenment, others, like, the, japanese, rinzai, zen, tradition, emphasize, sudden, insight, but, nevertheless, also, prescribe, intensive, training, including, meditation, and, self, restraint, although, theravada, does, not, acknowledge, the, existence, of, a, theistic, absolute, it, does, postulate, nirvana, as, a, transcendent, reality, which, may, be, attained, it, further, stresses, transformation, of, the, personality, through, meditative, practice, self, restraint, and, morally, just, behaviour, according, to, richard, h, jones, theravada, is, a, form, of, mindful, extrovertive, and, introvertive, mysticism, in, which, the, conceptual, structuring, of, experiences, is, weakened, and, the, ordinary, sense, of, self, is, weakened, it, is, best, known, in, the, west, from, the, vipassana, movement, a, number, of, branches, of, modern, therav, da, buddhism, from, burma, cambodia, laos, thailand, and, sri, lanka, and, includes, contemporary, american, buddhist, teachers, such, as, joseph, goldstein, and, jack, kornfield, the, yogacara, school, of, mahayana, investigates, the, workings, of, the, mind, stating, that, only, the, mind, citta, m, tra, or, the, representations, we, cognize, vij, apti, m, tra, really, exist, in, later, buddhist, mahayana, thought, which, took, an, idealistic, turn, the, unmodified, mind, came, to, be, seen, as, a, pure, consciousness, from, which, everything, arises, vij, apti, m, tra, coupled, with, buddha, nature, or, tathagatagarba, has, been, an, influential, concept, in, the, subsequent, development, of, mahayana, buddhism, not, only, in, india, but, also, in, china, and, tibet, most, notable, in, the, ch, n, zen, and, dzogchen, traditions, chinese, and, japanese, zen, is, grounded, on, the, chinese, understanding, of, the, buddha, nature, as, one, true, s, essence, and, the, two, truths, doctrine, as, a, polarity, between, relative, and, absolute, reality, zen, aims, at, insight, into, one, s, true, nature, or, buddha, nature, thereby, manifesting, absolute, reality, in, the, relative, reality, in, soto, this, buddha, nature, is, regarded, to, be, ever, present, and, shikan, taza, sitting, meditation, is, the, expression, of, the, already, existing, buddhahood, rinzai, zen, emphasises, the, need, for, a, break, through, insight, in, this, buddha, nature, but, also, stresses, that, further, practice, is, needed, to, deepen, the, insight, and, to, express, it, in, daily, life, as, expressed, in, the, three, mysterious, gates, the, four, ways, of, knowing, of, hakuin, and, the, ten, ox, herding, pictures, the, japanese, zen, scholar, d, t, suzuki, noted, similarities, between, zen, buddhism, and, christian, mysticism, especially, meister, eckhart, the, tibetan, vajrayana, tradition, is, based, on, madhyamaka, philosophy, and, tantra, in, deity, yoga, visualizations, of, deities, are, eventually, dissolved, to, realize, the, inherent, emptiness, of, every, thing, that, exists, dzogchen, which, is, being, taught, in, both, the, tibetan, buddhist, nyingma, school, and, the, b, n, tradition, focuses, on, direct, insight, into, our, real, nature, it, holds, that, mind, nature, is, manifested, when, one, is, enlightened, being, nonconceptually, aware, rigpa, open, presence, of, one, s, nature, a, recognition, of, one, s, beginningless, nature, mahamudra, has, similarities, with, dzogchen, emphasizing, the, meditational, approach, to, insight, and, liberation, taoist, philosophy, is, centered, on, the, tao, usually, translated, way, an, ineffable, cosmic, principle, the, contrasting, yet, interdependent, concepts, of, yin, and, yang, also, symbolise, harmony, with, taoist, scriptures, often, emphasising, the, yin, virtues, of, femininity, passivity, and, yieldingness, taoist, practice, includes, exercises, and, rituals, aimed, at, manipulating, the, life, force, qi, and, obtaining, health, and, longevity, these, have, been, elaborated, into, practices, such, as, tai, chi, which, are, well, known, in, the, west, today, there, is, also, occurring, in, the, west, what, richard, jones, calls, the, secularization, of, mysticism, that, is, the, separation, of, meditation, and, other, mystical, practices, from, their, traditional, use, in, religious, ways, of, life, to, only, secular, ends, of, purported, psychological, and, physiological, benefits, r, c, zaehner, distinguishes, three, fundamental, types, of, mysticism, namely, theistic, monistic, and, panenhenic, all, in, one, or, natural, mysticism, the, theistic, category, includes, most, forms, of, jewish, christian, and, islamic, mysticism, and, occasional, hindu, examples, such, as, ramanuja, and, the, bhagavad, gita, the, monistic, type, which, according, to, zaehner, is, based, upon, an, experience, of, the, unity, of, one, s, soul, includes, buddhism, and, hindu, schools, such, as, samkhya, and, advaita, vedanta, nature, mysticism, seems, to, refer, to, examples, that, do, not, fit, into, one, of, these, two, categories, walter, terence, stace, in, his, book, mysticism, and, philosophy, 1960, distinguished, two, types, of, mystical, experience, namely, extrovertive, and, introvertive, mysticism, extrovertive, mysticism, is, an, experience, of, the, unity, of, the, external, world, whereas, introvertive, mysticism, is, an, experience, of, unity, devoid, of, perceptual, objects, it, is, literally, an, experience, of, no, thing, ness, the, unity, in, extrovertive, mysticism, is, with, the, totality, of, objects, of, perception, while, perception, stays, continuous, unity, shines, through, the, same, world, the, unity, in, introvertive, mysticism, is, with, a, pure, consciousness, devoid, of, objects, of, perception, pure, unitary, consciousness, wherein, awareness, of, the, world, and, of, multiplicity, is, completely, obliterated, according, to, stace, such, experiences, are, nonsensous, and, nonintellectual, under, a, total, suppression, of, the, whole, empirical, content, stace, argues, that, doctrinal, differences, between, religious, traditions, are, inappropriate, criteria, when, making, cross, cultural, comparisons, of, mystical, experiences, stace, argues, that, mysticism, is, part, of, the, process, of, perception, not, interpretation, that, is, to, say, that, the, unity, of, mystical, experiences, is, perceived, and, only, afterwards, interpreted, according, to, the, perceiver, s, background, this, may, result, in, different, accounts, of, the, same, phenomenon, while, an, atheist, describes, the, unity, as, freed, from, empirical, filling, a, religious, person, might, describe, it, as, god, or, the, divine, since, the, 19th, century, mystical, experience, has, evolved, as, a, distinctive, concept, it, is, closely, related, to, mysticism, but, lays, sole, emphasis, on, the, experiential, aspect, be, it, spontaneous, or, induced, by, human, behavior, whereas, mysticism, encompasses, a, broad, range, of, practices, aiming, at, a, transformation, of, the, person, not, just, inducing, mystical, experiences, william, james, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, is, the, classic, study, on, religious, or, mystical, experience, which, influenced, deeply, both, the, academic, and, popular, understanding, of, religious, experience, he, popularized, the, use, of, the, term, religious, experience, in, his, varieties, and, influenced, the, understanding, of, mysticism, as, a, distinctive, experience, which, supplies, knowledge, of, the, transcendental, under, the, influence, of, william, james, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, heavily, centered, on, people, s, conversion, experiences, most, philosophers, interest, in, mysticism, has, been, in, distinctive, allegedly, knowledge, granting, mystical, experiences, yet, gelman, notes, that, so, called, mystical, experience, is, not, a, transitional, event, as, william, james, claimed, but, an, abiding, consciousness, accompanying, a, person, throughout, the, day, or, parts, of, it, for, that, reason, it, might, be, better, to, speak, of, mystical, consciousness, which, can, be, either, fleeting, or, abiding, most, mystical, traditions, warn, against, an, attachment, to, mystical, experiences, and, offer, a, protective, and, hermeneutic, framework, to, accommodate, these, experiences, these, same, traditions, offer, the, means, to, induce, mystical, experiences, which, may, have, several, origins, the, theoretical, study, of, mystical, experience, has, shifted, from, an, experiential, privatized, and, perennialist, approach, to, a, contextual, and, empirical, approach, the, experientalist, approach, sees, mystical, experience, as, a, private, expression, of, perennial, truths, separate, from, its, historical, and, cultural, context, the, contextual, approach, which, also, includes, constructionism, and, attribution, theory, takes, into, account, the, historical, and, cultural, context, neurological, research, takes, an, empirical, approach, relating, mystical, experiences, to, neurological, processes, the, term, mystical, experience, evolved, as, a, distinctive, concept, since, the, 19th, century, laying, sole, emphasis, on, the, experiential, aspect, be, it, spontaneous, or, induced, by, human, behavior, perennialists, regard, those, various, experience, traditions, as, pointing, to, one, universal, transcendental, reality, for, which, those, experiences, offer, the, proof, in, this, approach, mystical, experiences, are, privatised, separated, from, the, context, in, which, they, emerge, well, known, representatives, are, william, james, r, c, zaehner, william, stace, and, robert, forman, the, perennial, position, is, largely, dismissed, by, scholars, but, has, lost, none, of, its, popularity, in, contrast, for, the, past, decades, most, scholars, have, favored, a, constructionist, approach, which, states, that, mystical, experiences, are, fully, constructed, by, the, ideas, symbols, and, practices, that, mystics, are, familiar, with, critics, of, the, term, religious, experience, note, that, the, notion, of, religious, experience, or, mystical, experience, as, marking, insight, into, religious, truth, is, a, modern, development, and, contemporary, researchers, of, mysticism, note, that, mystical, experiences, are, shaped, by, the, concepts, which, the, mystic, brings, to, and, which, shape, his, experience, what, is, being, experienced, is, being, determined, by, the, expectations, and, the, conceptual, background, of, the, mystic, richard, jones, draws, a, distinction, between, anticonstructivism, and, perennialism, constructivism, can, be, rejected, with, respect, to, a, certain, class, of, mystical, experiences, without, ascribing, to, a, perennialist, philosophy, on, the, relation, of, mystical, doctrines, one, can, reject, constructivism, without, claiming, that, mystical, experiences, reveal, a, cross, cultural, perennial, truth, for, example, a, christian, can, reject, both, constructivism, and, perennialism, in, arguing, that, there, is, a, union, with, god, free, of, cultural, construction, constructivism, versus, anticonstructivism, is, a, matter, of, the, nature, of, mystical, experiences, while, perennialism, is, a, matter, of, mystical, traditions, and, the, doctrines, they, espouse, the, perennial, position, is, now, largely, dismissed, by, scholars, and, the, contextual, approach, has, become, the, common, approach, contextualism, takes, into, account, the, historical, and, cultural, context, of, mystical, experiences, the, attribution, approach, views, mystical, experience, as, non, ordinary, states, of, consciousness, which, are, explained, in, a, religious, framework, according, to, proudfoot, mystics, unconsciously, merely, attribute, a, doctrinal, content, to, ordinary, experiences, that, is, mystics, project, cognitive, content, onto, otherwise, ordinary, experiences, having, a, strong, emotional, impact, this, approach, has, been, further, elaborated, by, ann, taves, in, her, religious, experience, reconsidered, she, incorporates, both, neurological, and, cultural, approaches, in, the, study, of, mystical, experience, neurological, research, takes, an, empirical, approach, relating, mystical, experiences, to, neurological, processes, this, leads, to, a, central, philosophical, issue, does, the, identification, of, neural, triggers, or, neural, correlates, of, mystical, experiences, prove, that, mystical, experiences, are, no, more, than, brain, events, or, does, it, merely, identify, the, brain, activity, occurring, during, a, genuine, cognitive, event, the, most, common, positions, are, that, neurology, reduces, mystical, experiences, or, that, neurology, is, neutral, to, the, issue, of, mystical, cognitivity, interest, in, mystical, experiences, and, psychedelic, drugs, has, also, recently, seen, a, resurgence, the, temporal, lobe, seems, to, be, involved, in, mystical, experiences, and, in, the, change, in, personality, that, may, result, from, such, experiences, it, generates, the, feeling, of, i, and, gives, a, feeling, of, familiarity, or, strangeness, to, the, perceptions, of, the, senses, there, is, a, long, standing, notion, that, epilepsy, and, religion, are, linked, and, some, religious, figures, may, have, had, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, tle, the, anterior, insula, may, be, involved, in, ineffability, a, strong, feeling, of, certainty, which, cannot, be, expressed, in, words, which, is, a, common, quality, in, mystical, experiences, according, to, picard, this, feeling, of, certainty, may, be, caused, by, a, dysfunction, of, the, anterior, insula, a, part, of, the, brain, which, is, involved, in, interoception, self, reflection, and, in, avoiding, uncertainty, about, the, internal, representations, of, the, world, by, anticipation, of, resolution, of, uncertainty, or, risk, a, philosophical, issue, in, the, study, of, mysticism, is, the, relation, of, mysticism, to, morality, albert, schweitzer, presented, the, classic, account, of, mysticism, and, morality, being, incompatible, arthur, danto, also, argued, that, morality, is, at, least, incompatible, with, indian, mystical, beliefs, walter, stace, on, the, other, hand, argued, not, only, are, mysticism, and, morality, compatible, but, that, mysticism, is, the, source, and, justification, of, morality, others, studying, multiple, mystical, traditions, have, concluded, that, the, relation, of, mysticism, and, morality, is, not, as, simple, as, that, richard, king, also, points, to, disjunction, between, mystical, experience, and, social, justice, the, privatisation, of, mysticism, that, is, the, increasing, tendency, to, locate, the, mystical, in, the, psychological, realm, of, personal, experiences, serves, to, exclude, it, from, political, issues, as, social, justice, mysticism, thus, becomes, seen, as, a, personal, matter, of, cultivating, inner, states, of, tranquility, and, equanimity, which, rather, than, seeking, to, transform, the, world, serve, to, accommodate, the, individual, to, the, status, quo, through, the, alleviation, of, anxiety, and, stress
