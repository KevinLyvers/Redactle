he, does, not, whereas, i, as, i, do, not, know, anything, do, not, think, i, do, either, this, became, immortalized, in, the, phrase, i, know, that, i, know, nothing, an, aphorism, suggesting, that, it, is, wise, to, recognize, one, s, own, ignorance, and, to, value, epistemic, humility, the, ancient, romans, also, valued, wisdom, which, was, personified, as, minerva, or, pallas, she, also, represents, skillful, knowledge, and, the, virtues, especially, chastity, her, symbol, was, the, owl, which, is, still, a, popular, representation, of, wisdom, because, it, can, see, in, darkness, she, was, said, to, have, been, born, from, jupiter, s, forehead, odin, is, known, for, his, wisdom, often, as, acquired, through, various, hardships, and, ordeals, involving, pain, and, self, sacrifice, in, one, instance, he, plucked, out, an, eye, and, offered, it, to, m, mir, guardian, of, the, well, of, knowledge, and, wisdom, in, return, for, a, drink, from, the, well, in, another, famous, account, odin, hanged, himself, for, nine, nights, from, yggdrasil, the, world, tree, that, unites, all, the, realms, of, existence, suffering, from, hunger, and, thirst, and, finally,

mythology, of, ancient, egypt, thoth, married, to, maat, in, ancient, egyptian, order, righteousness, truth, was, regarded, as, the, being, who, introduced, wisdom, to, the, nation, the, berlin, wisdom, paradigm, is, an, expertise, model, of, life, wisdom, public, schools, in, the, u, s, sometimes, nod, at, character, education, which, would, include, training, in, wisdom, nicholas, maxwell, a, philosopher, in, the, united, kingdom, believes, academia, ought, to, alter, its, focus, from, the, acquisition, of, knowledge, to, seeking, and, promoting, wisdom, this, he, defines, as, the, capacity, to, realize, what, is, of, value, in, life, for, oneself, and, others, he, teaches, that, new, knowledge, and, technological, know, how, increase, our, power, to, act, without, wisdom, though, maxwell, claims, this, new, knowledge, may, cause, human, harm, as, well, as, human, good, he, argues, that, the, pursuit, of, knowledge, is, indeed, valuable, and, good, but, that, it, should, be, considered, a, part, of, the, broader, task, of, improving, wisdom, the, three, major, psychological, categories, for, wisdom, are, personality, development, and, expertise, psychologists, have, begun, to, gather, data, on, commonly, held, beliefs, or, folk, theories, about, wisdom, initial, analyses, indicate, that, although, there, is, an, overlap, of, the, implicit, theory, of, wisdom, with, intelligence, perceptiveness, spirituality, and, shrewdness, it, is, evident, that, wisdom, is, an, expertise, in, dealing, with, difficult, questions, of, life, and, adaptation, to, the, complex, requirements, the, field, of, psychology, has, also, developed, explicit, theories, and, empirical, research, on, the, psychological, processes, underlying, wisdom, opinions, on, the, psychological, definition, of, wisdom, vary, but, there, is, some, consensus, that, critical, to, wisdom, are, certain, meta, cognitive, processes, that, afford, life, reflection, and, judgment, about, critical, life, matters, these, processes, include, recognizing, the, limits, of, one, s, own, knowledge, acknowledging, uncertainty, and, change, attention, to, context, and, the, bigger, picture, and, integrating, different, perspectives, of, a, situation, cognitive, scientists, suggest, that, wisdom, requires, coordinating, such, reasoning, processes, for, insight, into, managing, one, s, life, reasoning, of, this, sort, is, both, theoretically, and, empirically, distinct, from, general, fluid, or, crystallized, intelligence, researchers, have, shown, empirically, that, wise, reasoning, is, distinct, from, iq, baltes, and, colleagues, defined, wisdom, as, the, ability, to, deal, with, the, contradictions, of, a, specific, situation, and, to, assess, the, consequences, of, an, action, for, themselves, and, for, others, it, is, achieved, when, in, a, concrete, situation, a, balance, between, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and, institutional, interests, can, be, prepared, balance, appears, to, be, a, critical, criterion, of, wisdom, empirical, research, provides, some, support, for, this, idea, showing, that, wisdom, related, reasoning, is, associated, with, achieving, balance, between, intrapersonal, and, interpersonal, interests, when, facing, personal, life, challenges, and, when, setting, goals, for, managing, interpersonal, conflicts, researchers, also, explore, the, role, of, emotions, in, wisdom, most, agree, that, emotions, and, emotion, regulation, are, key, to, effectively, managing, the, kinds, of, complex, and, arousing, situations, that, most, call, for, wisdom, much, empirical, research, has, focused, on, the, cognitive, or, meta, cognitive, aspects, of, wisdom, assuming, that, an, ability, to, reason, through, difficult, situations, is, paramount, so, although, emotions, likely, play, a, role, in, how, wisdom, plays, out, in, real, events, and, in, reflecting, on, past, events, empirical, studies, were, late, to, develop, on, how, emotions, affect, a, person, s, ability, to, deal, wisely, with, complex, events, one, study, found, a, positive, relationship, between, diversity, of, emotional, experience, and, wise, reasoning, irrespective, of, emotional, intensity, researchers, have, defined, wisdom, as, the, coordination, of, knowledge, and, experience, and, its, deliberate, use, to, improve, well, being, under, this, definition, wisdom, is, further, refined, as, having, the, following, facets, this, theoretical, model, has, not, been, tested, empirically, with, an, exception, of, a, broad, link, between, wisdom, related, reasoning, and, well, being, grossmann, and, colleagues, summarized, prior, psychological, literature, to, conclude, that, wisdom, involves, certain, cognitive, processes, that, afford, unbiased, sound, judgment, in, the, face, of, ill, defined, life, situations, grossmann, found, that, habitually, speaking, and, thinking, of, oneself, in, the, third, person, increases, these, characteristics, which, means, that, such, a, habit, makes, a, person, wiser, grossmann, says, contextual, factors, such, as, culture, experiences, and, social, situations, influence, the, understanding, development, and, propensity, of, wisdom, with, implications, for, training, and, educational, practice, these, contextual, factors, are, the, focus, of, continuing, research, for, instance, grossmann, and, kross, identified, a, phenomenon, they, called, the, solomon, s, paradox, that, people, reflect, more, wisely, on, other, people, s, problems, than, on, their, own, it, is, named, after, king, solomon, who, had, legendary, sagacity, when, making, judgments, about, other, people, s, dilemmas, but, lacked, insight, when, it, came, to, important, decisions, in, his, own, life, a, researcher, will, measure, wisdom, differently, depending, on, their, theoretical, position, about, the, nature, of, wisdom, for, example, some, view, wisdom, as, a, stable, personality, trait, others, as, a, context, bound, process, those, wedded, to, the, former, approach, often, use, single, shot, questionnaires, which, are, prone, to, biased, responses, something, that, is, antithetical, to, the, wisdom, construct, and, fails, to, study, wisdom, in, the, contexts, where, it, is, most, relevant, complex, life, challenges, in, contrast, researchers, who, prefer, the, latter, approach, measure, wisdom, related, features, of, cognition, motivation, and, emotion, in, the, context, of, a, specific, situation, such, state, level, measures, provide, less, biased, responses, as, well, as, greater, power, in, explaining, meaningful, psychological, processes, also, a, focus, on, the, situation, allows, wisdom, researchers, to, develop, a, fuller, understanding, of, the, role, of, context, in, producing, wisdom, for, example, studies, have, shown, evidence, of, cross, cultural, and, within, cultural, variability, and, systematic, variability, in, reasoning, wisely, across, contexts, and, in, daily, life, many, but, not, all, studies, find, that, adults, self, ratings, of, perspective, and, wisdom, do, not, depend, on, age, this, conflicts, with, the, popular, notion, that, wisdom, increases, with, age, the, answer, to, whether, age, and, wisdom, correlate, depends, on, how, one, defines, wisdom, and, one, s, experimental, technique, the, answer, to, this, question, also, depends, on, the, domain, studied, and, the, role, of, experience, in, that, domain, with, some, contexts, favoring, older, adults, others, favoring, younger, adults, and, some, not, differentiating, age, groups, rigorous, longitudinal, work, is, needed, to, answer, this, question, while, most, studies, rely, on, cross, sectional, observations, the, jeste, thomas, wisdom, index, is, based, on, a, 28, question, survey, sd, wise, 28, created, by, researchers, at, the, university, of, california, san, diego, to, determine, how, wise, a, person, is, in, 2021, dr, dilip, v, jeste, and, his, colleagues, created, a, 7, question, survey, sd, wise, 7, testing, seven, components, acceptance, of, diverse, perspectives, decisiveness, emotional, regulation, prosocial, behaviors, self, reflection, social, advising, and, to, a, lesser, degree, spirituality, in, the, avesta, gathas, hymns, traditionally, attributed, to, zoroaster, ahura, mazda, means, lord, ahura, and, wisdom, mazda, and, is, the, central, deity, who, embodies, goodness, being, also, called, good, thought, vohu, manah, in, zoroastrianism, the, order, of, the, universe, and, morals, is, called, asha, in, avestan, truth, righteousness, which, is, determined, by, this, omniscient, thought, and, also, considered, a, deity, emanating, from, ahura, amesha, spenta, it, is, related, to, another, ahura, deity, spenta, mainyu, active, mentality, it, says, in, yazna, 31, to, him, shall, the, best, befall, who, as, one, that, knows, speaks, to, me, right, s, truthful, word, of, welfare, and, of, immortality, even, the, dominion, of, mazda, which, good, thought, shall, increase, for, him, about, which, he, in, the, beginning, thus, thought, let, the, blessed, realms, be, filled, with, light, he, it, is, that, by, his, wisdom, created, right, in, bah, faith, scripture, the, essence, of, wisdom, is, the, fear, of, god, the, dread, of, his, scourge, and, punishment, and, the, apprehension, of, his, justice, and, decree, wisdom, is, seen, as, a, light, that, casts, away, darkness, and, its, dictates, must, be, observed, under, all, circumstances, one, may, obtain, knowledge, and, wisdom, through, god, his, word, and, his, divine, manifestation, the, source, of, all, learning, is, the, knowledge, of, god, the, word, wisdom, is, mentioned, 222, times, in, the, hebrew, bible, it, was, regarded, as, one, of, the, highest, virtues, among, the, israelites, along, with, kindness, and, justice, the, books, of, proverbs, and, psalms, each, urge, readers, to, obtain, and, to, increase, in, wisdom, in, the, hebrew, bible, wisdom, is, exemplified, by, solomon, who, asks, god, for, wisdom, in, 2, chronicles, 1, 10, much, of, the, book, of, proverbs, which, is, filled, with, wise, sayings, is, attributed, to, solomon, in, proverbs, 9, 10, the, fear, of, the, lord, is, called, the, beginning, of, wisdom, another, proverb, says, that, wisdom, is, gained, from, god, for, the, lord, gives, wisdom, from, his, mouth, come, knowledge, and, understanding, in, proverbs, 1, 20, there, is, also, reference, to, wisdom, personified, in, female, form, wisdom, calls, aloud, in, the, streets, she, raises, her, voice, in, the, marketplaces, in, proverbs, 8, 22, 31, this, personified, wisdom, is, described, as, being, present, with, god, before, creation, began, and, even, as, taking, part, in, creation, itself, king, solomon, continues, his, teachings, of, wisdom, in, the, book, of, ecclesiastes, solomon, discusses, his, exploration, of, the, meaning, of, life, and, fulfillment, as, he, speaks, of, life, s, pleasures, work, and, materialism, yet, concludes, that, it, is, all, meaningless, meaningless, meaningless, says, the, teacher, utterly, meaningless, everything, is, meaningless, for, with, much, wisdom, comes, much, sorrow, the, more, knowledge, the, more, grief, solomon, concludes, that, all, life, s, pleasures, and, riches, and, even, wisdom, mean, nothing, if, there, is, no, relationship, with, god, the, talmud, teaches, that, a, wise, person, can, foresee, the, future, nolad, is, a, hebrew, word, for, future, but, also, the, hebrew, word, for, birth, so, one, rabbinic, interpretation, of, the, teaching, is, that, a, wise, person, is, one, who, can, foresee, the, consequences, of, his, her, choices, i, e, can, see, the, future, that, he, she, gives, birth, to, in, christian, theology, wisdom, from, hebrew, transliteration, chokm, h, pronounced, khok, maw, greek, sophia, latin, sapientia, describes, an, aspect, of, god, or, the, theological, concept, regarding, the, wisdom, of, god, christian, thought, opposes, secular, wisdom, and, embraces, godly, wisdom, paul, the, apostle, states, that, worldly, wisdom, thinks, the, claims, of, christ, to, be, foolishness, however, to, those, who, are, on, the, path, to, salvation, christ, represents, the, wisdom, of, god, wisdom, is, considered, one, of, the, seven, gifts, of, the, holy, spirit, 1, corinthians, 12, 8, 10, gives, an, alternate, list, of, nine, virtues, among, which, is, wisdom, the, epistle, of, james, is, a, new, testament, analogue, of, the, book, of, proverbs, in, that, it, also, discusses, wisdom, it, reiterates, the, message, from, proverbs, that, wisdom, comes, from, god, by, stating, if, any, of, you, lacks, wisdom, you, should, ask, god, who, gives, generously, to, all, without, finding, fault, and, it, will, be, given, to, you, james, also, explains, how, wisdom, helps, one, acquire, other, forms, of, virtue, but, the, wisdom, that, comes, from, heaven, is, first, of, all, pure, then, peace, loving, considerate, submissive, full, of, mercy, and, good, fruit, impartial, and, sincere, james, focuses, on, using, this, god, given, wisdom, to, perform, acts, of, service, to, the, less, fortunate, apart, from, proverbs, ecclesiastes, and, james, other, main, books, of, wisdom, in, the, bible, are, job, psalms, and, 1, and, 2, corinthians, which, give, lessons, on, gaining, and, using, wisdom, through, difficult, situations, the, islamic, term, for, wisdom, is, hikmah, prophets, of, islam, are, believed, by, muslims, to, possess, great, wisdom, the, term, occurs, a, number, of, times, in, the, quran, notably, in, sura, 2, 269, sura, 22, 46, and, sura, 6, 151, the, sufi, philosopher, ibn, arabi, considers, al, hakim, the, wise, as, one, of, the, names, of, the, creator, wisdom, and, truth, considered, divine, attributes, were, valued, in, islamic, sciences, and, philosophy, the, first, arab, philosopher, al, kindi, says, at, the, beginning, of, his, book, we, must, not, be, ashamed, to, admire, the, truth, or, to, acquire, it, from, wherever, it, comes, even, if, it, should, come, from, far, flung, nations, and, foreign, peoples, there, is, for, the, student, of, truth, nothing, more, important, than, the, truth, nor, is, the, truth, demeaned, or, diminished, by, the, one, who, states, or, conveys, it, no, one, is, demeaned, by, the, truth, rather, all, are, ennobled, by, it, in, the, inuit, tradition, developing, wisdom, was, one, of, the, aims, of, teaching, an, inuit, elder, said,

between, asanga, vasubandhu, and, xuanzang, developing, wisdom, is, of, central, importance, in, buddhist, traditions, where, the, ultimate, aim, is, often, presented, as, seeing, things, as, they, are, or, as, gaining, a, penetrative, understanding, of, all, phenomena, which, in, turn, is, described, as, ultimately, leading, to, the, complete, freedom, from, suffering, in, buddhism, developing,
