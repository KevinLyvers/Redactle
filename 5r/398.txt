hurricanes, dust, devils, seashells, and, whirlpools, which, were, elemental, forces, that, had, significance, in, aztec, mythology, codex, drawings, pictured, both, quetzalcoatl, and, xolotl,

documentation, of, the, worship, of, a, feathered, serpent, occurs, in, teotihuacan, in, the, first, century, bc, or, first, century, ad, that, period, lies, within, the, late, preclassic, to, early, classic, period, 400, bc, 600, ad, of, mesoamerican, chronology, veneration, of, the, figure, appears, to, have, spread, throughout, mesoamerica, by, the, late, classic, period, 600, 900, ad, in, the, postclassic, period, 900, 1519, ad, the, worship, of, the, feathered, serpent, deity, centered, in, the, primary, mexican, religious, center, of, cholula, in, this, period, the, deity, is, known, to, have, been, named, quetzalc, hu, tl, by, his, nahua, followers, in, the, maya, area, he, was, approximately, equivalent, to, kukulkan, and, gukumatz, names, that, also, roughly, translate, as, feathered, serpent, in, different, mayan, languages, in, the, era, following, the, 16th, century, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, a, number, of, records, conflated, quetzalcoatl, with, ce, acatl, topiltzin, a, ruler, of, the, mythico, historic, city, of, tollan, historians, debate, to, what, degree, or, whether, at, all, these, narratives, about, this, legendary, toltec, ruler, describe, historical, events, furthermore, early, spanish, sources, written, by, clerics, tend, to, identify, the, god, ruler, quetzalcoatl, of, these, narratives, with, either, hern, n, cort, s, or, thomas, the, apostle, identifications, which, have, also, become, sources, of, a, diversity, of, opinions, about, the, nature, of, quetzalcoatl, the, name, quetzalcoatl, comes, from, the, nahuatl, language, and, means, precious, serpent, or, quetzal, feathered, serpent, in, the, 17th, century, ixtlilx, chitl, a, descendant, of, aztec, royalty, and, historian, of, the, nahua, people, wrote, quetzalcoatl, in, its, literal, sense, means, serpent, of, precious, feathers, but, in, the, allegorical, sense, wisest, of, men, in, mesoamerican, history, many, different, ethnopolitical, groups, worshiped, a, feathered, serpent, deity, evidence, of, such, worship, comes, from, the, iconography, of, different, mesoamerican, cultures, in, which, serpent, motifs, occur, frequently, on, the, basis, of, the, different, symbolic, systems, used, in, portrayals, of, the, feathered, serpent, deity, in, different, cultures, and, periods, scholars, have, interpreted, the, religious, and, symbolic, meaning, of, the, feathered, serpent, deity, in, mesoamerican, cultures, the, earliest, known, iconographic, depiction, of, the, deity, appears, on, stela, 19, at, the, olmec, site, of, la, venta, dated, to, around, 900, bc, it, depicts, a, serpent, rising, up, behind, a, person, probably, engaged, in, a, shamanic, ritual, although, probably, not, exactly, a, depiction, of, the, same, feathered, serpent, deity, worshipped, in, classic, and, post, classic, periods, it, shows, the, continuity, of, symbolism, of, feathered, snakes, in, mesoamerica, from, the, formative, period, and, on, for, example, in, comparison, to, the, maya, vision, serpent, shown, below, the, first, culture, to, use, the, symbol, of, a, feathered, serpent, as, an, important, religious, and, political, symbol, was, that, of, teotihuacan, at, temples, such, as, the, aptly, named, quetzalcoatl, temple, in, the, ciudadela, complex, feathered, serpents, figure, prominently, and, alternate, with, a, different, kind, of, serpent, head, the, earliest, depictions, of, the, feathered, serpent, deity, were, fully, zoomorphic, depicting, the, serpent, as, an, actual, snake, but, already, among, the, classic, maya, images, of, the, deity, began, acquiring, human, features, such, as, the, beard, see, the, borgia, codex, illustration, below, that, he, was, sometimes, depicted, with, in, the, iconography, of, the, classic, period, maya, serpent, imagery, is, also, prevalent, a, snake, often, appears, as, the, embodiment, of, the, sky, itself, and, a, vision, serpent, is, a, shamanic, helper, presenting, maya, kings, with, visions, of, the, underworld, the, archaeological, record, shows, that, after, the, fall, of, teotihuacan, that, marked, the, beginning, of, the, epi, classic, period, in, mesoamerican, chronology, around, 600, ad, the, cult, of, the, feathered, serpent, spread, to, new, religious, and, political, centers, in, central, mexico, centers, such, as, xochicalco, cacaxtla, and, cholula, feathered, serpent, iconography, is, prominent, at, all, of, these, sites, cholula, remained, the, most, important, center, of, worship, of, quetzalcoatl, the, aztec, nahua, version, of, the, feathered, serpent, deity, in, the, post, classic, period, during, the, epi, classic, period, a, dramatic, spread, of, feathered, serpent, iconography, is, evidenced, throughout, mesoamerica, and, during, this, period, images, begin, to, figure, prominently, at, sites, such, as, chich, n, itz, el, taj, n, and, throughout, the, maya, area, colonial, documentary, sources, from, the, maya, area, frequently, speak, of, the, arrival, of, foreigners, from, the, central, mexican, plateau, often, led, by, a, man, whose, name, translates, as, feathered, serpent, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, stories, recall, the, spread, of, the, feathered, serpent, cult, in, the, epi, classic, and, early, post, classic, periods, represented, as, the, plumed, serpent, quetzalcoatl, was, also, seen, as, a, manifestation, of, the, wind, one, of, the, most, powerful, forces, of, nature, a, text, in, the, nahuatl, language, captures, this, relationship, quetzalcoatl, yn, ehecatl, ynteiacancauh, yntlachpancauh, in, tlaloque, yn, aoaque, yn, qujqujiauhti, auh, yn, jquac, molhuja, eheca, mjtoa, teuhtli, quaqualaca, ycoioca, tetecujca, tlatlaiooa, tlatlapitza, tlatlatzinj, motlatlaueltia, quetzalcoatl, he, was, the, wind, the, guide, and, road, sweeper, of, the, rain, gods, of, the, masters, of, the, water, of, those, who, brought, rain, and, when, the, wind, rose, when, the, dust, rumbled, and, it, crack, and, there, was, a, great, din, became, it, became, dark, and, the, wind, blew, in, many, directions, and, it, thundered, then, it, was, said, is, wrathful, quetzalcoatl, also, became, linked, with, rulership, and, priestly, office, additionally, among, the, toltec, the, name, was, used, as, a, military, title, and, its, representation, as, an, emblem, in, the, post, classic, nahua, civilization, of, central, mexico, aztec, the, worship, of, quetzalcoatl, was, ubiquitous, cult, worship, may, have, involved, the, ingestion, of, hallucinogenic, mushrooms, psilocybes, considered, sacred, the, most, important, center, was, cholula, where, the, world, s, largest, pyramid, was, dedicated, to, quetzalcoatl, worship, in, aztec, culture, depictions, of, quetzalcoatl, were, fully, anthropomorphic, quetzalcoatl, was, associated, with, the, wind, god, ehecatl, and, is, often, depicted, with, his, insignia, a, beak, like, mask, on, the, basis, of, the, teotihuacan, iconographical, depictions, of, the, feathered, serpent, archaeologist, karl, taube, has, argued, that, the, feathered, serpent, was, a, symbol, of, fertility, and, of, internal, political, structures, contrasting, with, the, war, serpent, symbolizing, the, outwards, military, expansion, of, the, teotihuacan, empire, historian, enrique, florescano, also, analyzing, teotihuacan, iconography, argues, that, the, feathered, serpent, was, part, of, a, triad, of, agricultural, deities, the, feathered, serpent, was, furthermore, connected, to, the, planet, venus, because, of, this, planet, s, importance, as, a, sign, of, the, beginning, of, the, rainy, season, to, both, teotihuacan, and, maya, cultures, venus, was, in, turn, also, symbolically, connected, with, warfare, while, not, usually, feathered, classic, maya, serpent, iconography, seems, related, to, the, belief, in, a, sky, venus, creator, war, and, fertility, related, serpent, deity, in, an, example, from, yaxchilan, the, vision, serpent, has, the, human, face, of, the, young, maize, god, further, suggesting, a, connection, to, fertility, and, vegetational, renewal, the, maya, young, maize, god, was, also, connected, to, venus, in, xochicalco, depictions, of, the, feathered, serpent, accompany, the, image, of, a, seated, armed, ruler, and, the, hieroglyph, for, the, day, sign, 9, wind, the, date, 9, wind, is, known, to, be, associated, with, fertility, venus, and, war, among, the, maya, and, frequently, occurs, in, relation, to, quetzalcoatl, in, other, mesoamerican, cultures, on, the, basis, of, the, iconography, of, the, feathered, serpent, deity, at, sites, such, as, teotihuacan, xochicalco, chich, n, itz, tula, and, tenochtitlan, combined, with, certain, ethnohistorical, sources, historian, david, carrasco, has, argued, that, the, preeminent, function, of, the, feathered, serpent, deity, throughout, mesoamerican, history, was, as, the, patron, deity, of, the, urban, center, a, god, of, culture, and, civilization, to, the, aztecs, quetzalcoatl, was, as, his, name, indicates, a, feathered, serpent, he, was, a, creator, deity, having, contributed, essentially, to, the, creation, of, mankind, he, also, had, anthropomorphic, forms, for, example, in, his, aspects, as, ehecatl, the, wind, god, among, the, aztecs, the, name, quetzalcoatl, was, also, a, priestly, title, as, the, two, most, important, priests, of, the, aztec, templo, mayor, were, called, quetzalcoatl, tlamacazqui, in, the, aztec, ritual, calendar, different, deities, were, associated, with, the, cycle, of, year, names, quetzalcoatl, was, tied, to, the, year, ce, acatl, one, reed, which, correlates, to, the, year, 1519, the, exact, significance, and, attributes, of, quetzalcoatl, varied, somewhat, between, civilizations, and, through, history, there, are, several, stories, about, the, birth, of, quetzalcoatl, in, a, version, of, the, myth, quetzalcoatl, was, born, by, a, virgin, named, chimalman, to, whom, the, god, ometeotl, appeared, in, a, dream, in, another, story, the, virgin, chimalman, conceived, quetzalcoatl, by, swallowing, an, emerald, a, third, story, narrates, that, chimalman, was, hit, in, the, womb, by, an, arrow, shot, by, mixcoatl, and, nine, months, later, she, gave, birth, to, a, child, which, was, called, quetzalcoatl, a, fourth, story, narrates, that, quetzalcoatl, was, born, from, coatlicue, who, already, had, four, hundred, children, who, formed, the, stars, of, the, milky, way, according, to, another, version, of, the, myth, quetzalcoatl, is, one, of, the, four, sons, of, ometecuhtli, and, omecihuatl, the, four, tezcatlipocas, each, of, whom, presided, over, one, of, the, four, cardinal, directions, over, the, west, presides, the, white, tezcatlipoca, quetzalcoatl, the, god, of, light, justice, mercy, and, wind, over, the, south, presides, the, blue, tezcatlipoca, huitzilopochtli, the, god, of, war, over, the, east, presides, the, red, tezcatlipoca, xipe, totec, the, god, of, gold, farming, and, springtime, and, over, the, north, presides, the, black, tezcatlipoca, known, by, no, other, name, than, tezcatlipoca, the, god, of, judgment, night, deceit, sorcery, and, the, earth, quetzalcoatl, was, often, considered, the, god, of, the, morning, star, and, his, twin, brother, xolotl, was, the, evening, star, venus, as, the, morning, star, he, was, known, by, the, title, tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, meaning, lord, of, the, star, of, the, dawn, he, was, known, as, the, inventor, of, books, and, the, calendar, the, giver, of, maize, corn, to, mankind, and, sometimes, as, a, symbol, of, death, and, resurrection, quetzalcoatl, was, also, the, patron, of, the, priests, and, the, title, of, the, twin, aztec, high, priests, some, legends, describe, him, as, opposed, to, human, sacrifice, while, others, describe, him, practicing, it, most, mesoamerican, beliefs, included, cycles, of, suns, often, our, current, time, was, considered, the, fifth, sun, the, previous, four, having, been, destroyed, by, flood, fire, and, the, like, quetzalcoatl, went, to, mictlan, the, underworld, and, created, fifth, world, mankind, from, the, bones, of, the, previous, races, with, the, help, of, cihuacoatl, using, his, own, blood, from, a, wound, he, inflicted, on, his, earlobes, calves, tongue, and, penis, to, imbue, the, bones, with, new, life, it, is, also, suggested, that, he, was, a, son, of, xochiquetzal, and, mixcoatl, in, the, codex, chimalpopoca, it, is, said, quetzalcoatl, was, coerced, by, tezcatlipoca, into, becoming, drunk, on, pulque, cavorting, with, his, older, sister, quetzalpetlatl, a, celibate, priestess, and, neglecting, their, religious, duties, many, academics, conclude, this, passage, implies, incest, the, next, morning, quetzalcoatl, feeling, shame, and, regret, had, his, servants, build, him, a, stone, chest, adorn, him, in, turquoise, and, then, laying, in, the, chest, set, himself, on, fire, his, ashes, rose, into, the, sky, and, then, his, heart, followed, becoming, the, morning, star, see, tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, he, is, also, attributed, with, having, brought, the, cacao, plant, from, a, sacred, mountain, to, the, toltec, people, teaching, the, women, how, to, make, traditional, drinking, chocolate, since, the, sixteenth, century, it, has, been, widely, held, that, the, aztec, emperor, moctezuma, ii, initially, believed, the, landing, of, hern, n, cort, s, in, 1519, to, be, quetzalcoatl, s, return, this, view, has, been, questioned, by, ethno, historians, who, argue, that, the, quetzalcoatl, cort, s, connection, is, not, found, in, any, document, that, was, created, independently, of, post, conquest, spanish, influence, and, that, there, is, little, proof, of, a, pre, hispanic, belief, in, quetzalcoatl, s, return, most, documents, expounding, this, theory, are, of, entirely, spanish, origin, such, as, cort, s, s, letters, to, charles, v, of, spain, in, which, cort, s, goes, to, great, pains, to, present, the, naive, gullibility, of, the, aztecs, in, general, as, a, great, aid, in, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, much, of, the, idea, of, cort, s, being, seen, as, a, deity, can, be, traced, back, to, the, florentine, codex, written, down, some, 50, years, after, the, conquest, in, the, codex, s, description, of, the, first, meeting, between, moctezuma, and, cort, s, the, aztec, ruler, is, described, as, giving, a, prepared, speech, in, classical, oratorial, nahuatl, a, speech, which, as, described, in, the, codex, written, by, the, franciscan, bernardino, de, sahag, n, and, his, tlatelolcan, informants, included, such, prostrate, declarations, of, divine, or, near, divine, admiration, as, you, have, graciously, come, on, earth, you, have, graciously, approached, your, water, your, high, place, of, mexico, you, have, come, down, to, your, mat, your, throne, which, i, have, briefly, kept, for, you, i, who, used, to, keep, it, for, you, and, you, have, graciously, arrived, you, have, known, pain, you, have, known, weariness, now, come, on, earth, take, your, rest, enter, into, your, palace, rest, your, limbs, may, our, lords, come, on, earth, the, exact, intent, of, these, words, is, uncertain, the, rhetorical, style, of, classic, nahuatl, was, full, of, subtle, nuances, and, is, still, not, well, understood, matthew, restall, argues, that, if, moctezuma, s, politely, offered, his, throne, to, cort, s, it, may, have, been, meant, as, the, exact, opposite, since, politeness, in, aztec, culture, was, a, way, to, assert, dominance, and, show, superiority, this, speech, which, has, been, widely, referred, to, has, been, a, factor, in, the, widespread, belief, that, moctezuma, was, addressing, cort, s, as, the, returning, god, quetzalcoatl, other, parties, have, also, promulgated, the, idea, that, the, mesoamericans, believed, the, conquistadors, and, in, particular, cort, s, to, be, awaited, gods, most, notably, the, historians, of, the, franciscan, order, such, as, fray, ger, nimo, de, mendieta, some, franciscans, at, this, time, held, millennarian, beliefs, and, some, of, them, believed, that, cort, s, coming, to, the, new, world, ushered, in, the, final, era, of, evangelization, before, the, coming, of, the, millennium, franciscans, such, as, toribio, de, benavente, motolinia, saw, elements, of, christianity, in, the, pre, columbian, religions, and, therefore, believed, that, mesoamerica, had, been, evangelized, before, possibly, by, thomas, the, apostle, who, according, to, legend, had, gone, to, preach, beyond, the, ganges, franciscans, then, equated, the, original, quetzalcoatl, with, thomas, and, imagined, that, the, indians, had, long, awaited, his, return, to, take, part, once, again, in, god, s, kingdom, historian, matthew, restall, concludes, that, the, legend, of, the, returning, lords, originated, during, the, spanish, mexica, war, in, cort, s, reworking, of, moctezuma, s, welcome, speech, had, by, the, 1550s, merged, with, the, cort, s, as, quetzalcoatl, legend, that, the, franciscans, had, started, spreading, in, the, 1530s, restall, 2001, p, 114, some, scholarship, maintains, the, view, that, the, aztec, empire, s, fall, may, be, attributed, in, part, to, the, belief, in, cort, s, as, the, returning, quetzalcoatl, notably, in, works, by, david, carrasco, 1982, h, b, nicholson, 2001, 1957, and, john, pohl, 2016, carrasco, s, work, was, revised, in, 2000, and, the, new, edition, provides, a, valuable, overview, of, the, controversy, about, cortes, and, quetzalcoatl, however, a, majority, of, mesoamericanist, scholars, such, as, matthew, restall, 2003, 2018, james, lockhart, 1994, susan, d, gillespie, 1989, camilla, townsend, 2003a, 2003b, louise, burkhart, michel, graulich, and, michael, e, smith, 2003, among, others, consider, the, quetzalcoatl, cort, s, myth, as, one, of, many, myths, about, the, spanish, conquest, which, have, risen, in, the, early, post, conquest, period, there, is, no, question, that, the, legend, of, quetzalcoatl, played, a, significant, role, in, the, colonial, period, however, this, legend, likely, has, a, foundation, in, events, that, took, place, immediately, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, spaniards, a, 2012, exhibition, at, the, los, angeles, county, museum, of, art, and, the, dallas, museum, of, art, the, children, of, the, plumed, serpent, the, legacy, of, quetzalcoatl, in, ancient, mexico, demonstrated, the, existence, of, a, powerful, confederacy, of, eastern, nahuas, mixtecs, and, zapotecs, along, with, the, peoples, they, dominated, throughout, southern, mexico, between, 1200, and, 1600, pohl, fields, and, lyall, 2012, harvey, 2012, pohl, 2003, they, maintained, a, major, pilgrimage, and, commercial, center, at, cholula, puebla, which, the, spaniards, compared, to, both, rome, and, mecca, because, the, cult, of, the, god, united, its, constituents, through, a, field, of, common, social, political, and, religious, values, without, dominating, them, militarily, this, confederacy, engaged, in, almost, seventy, five, years, of, nearly, continuous, conflict, with, the, aztec, empire, of, the, triple, alliance, until, the, arrival, of, cort, s, members, of, this, confederacy, from, tlaxcala, puebla, and, oaxaca, provided, the, spaniards, with, the, army, that, first, reclaimed, the, city, of, cholula, from, its, pro, aztec, ruling, faction, and, ultimately, defeated, the, aztec, capital, of, tenochtitlan, mexico, city, the, tlaxcalteca, along, with, other, city, states, across, the, plain, of, puebla, then, supplied, the, auxiliary, and, logistical, support, for, the, conquests, of, guatemala, and, west, mexico, while, mixtec, and, zapotec, caciques, colonial, indigenous, rulers, gained, monopolies, in, the, overland, transport, of, manila, galleon, trade, through, mexico, and, formed, highly, lucrative, relationships, with, the, dominican, order, in, the, new, spanish, imperial, world, economic, system, that, explains, so, much, of, the, enduring, legacy, of, indigenous, life, ways, that, characterize, southern, mexico, and, explain, the, popularity, of, the, quetzalcoatl, legends, that, continued, through, the, colonial, period, to, the, present, day, according, to, the, book, of, mormon, the, resurrected, jesus, christ, descended, from, heaven, and, visited, the, people, of, the, american, continent, shortly, after, his, resurrection, based, on, the, book, of, mormon, account, some, followers, of, the, latter, day, saints, movement, believe, that, quetzalcoatl, was, jesus, christ, but, that, his, name, and, the, details, of, the, event, were, gradually, lost, over, time, quetzalcoatl, is, not, a, religious, symbol, in, the, latter, day, saint, faith, and, is, not, taught, as, such, nor, is, it, in, their, doctrine, that, quetzalcoatl, is, jesus, however, in, 1892, one, president, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, john, taylor, wrote, the, story, of, the, life, of, the, mexican, divinity, quetzalcoatl, closely, resembles, that, of, the, savior, so, closely, indeed, that, we, can, come, to, no, other, conclusion, than, that, quetzalcoatl, and, christ, are, the, same, being, but, the, history, of, the, former, has, been, handed, down, to, us, through, an, impure, lamanitish, source, which, has, sadly, disfigured, and, perverted, the, original, incidents, and, teachings, of, the, savior, s, life, and, ministry, latter, day, saint, author, brant, gardner, after, investigating, the, link, between, quetzalcoatl, and, jesus, concluded, that, the, association, amounts, to, nothing, more, than, folklore, in, a, 1986, paper, for, sunstone, he, noted, that, during, the, spanish, conquest, the, native, americans, and, the, catholic, priests, who, sympathized, with, them, felt, pressure, to, link, native, american, beliefs, with, christianity, thus, making, the, native, americans, seem, more, human, and, less, savage, over, time, quetzalcoatl, s, appearance, clothing, malevolent, nature, and, status, among, the, gods, were, reshaped, to, fit, a, more, christian, framework, quetzalcoatl, was, fictionalized, in, the, 1982, film, q, as, a, monster, that, terrorizes, new, york, city, the, deity, has, been, featured,
