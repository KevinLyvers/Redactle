myth, is, a, genre, of, folklore, consisting, primarily, of, narratives, that, play, a, fundamental, role, in, a, society, for, scholars, this, is, very, different, from, the, vernacular, usage, of, the, term, myth, that, refers, to, a, belief, that, is, not, true, instead, the, veracity, of, a, myth, is, not, a, defining, criterion, myths, are, often, endorsed, by, secular, and, religious, authorities, and, are, closely, linked, to, religion, or, spirituality, many, societies, group, their, myths, legends, and, history, together, considering, myths, and, legends, to, be, factual, accounts, of, their, remote, past, in, particular, creation, myths, take, place, in, a, primordial, age, when, the, world, had, not, achieved, its, later, form, origin, myths, explain, how, a, society, s, customs, institutions, and, taboos, were, established, and, sanctified, national, myths, are, narratives, about, a, nation, s, past, that, symbolize, the, nation, s, values, there, is, a, complex, relationship, between, recital, of, myths, and, the, enactment, of, rituals, the, word, myth, comes, from, ancient, greek, m, thos, meaning, speech, narrative, fiction, myth, plot, in, turn, ancient, greek, mytholog, a, story, lore, legends, or, the, telling, of, stories, combines, the, word, m, thos, with, the, suffix, logia, study, in, order, to, mean, romance, fiction, story, telling, accordingly, plato, used, mytholog, a, as, a, general, term, for, fiction, or, story, telling, of, any, kind, in, anglicised, form, this, greek, word, began, to, be, used, in, english, and, was, likewise, adapted, into, other, european, languages, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, a, much, narrower, sense, as, a, scholarly, term, for, traditional, story, especially, one, concerning, the, early, history, of, a, people, or, explaining, a, natural, or, social, phenomenon, and, typically, involving, supernatural, beings, or, events, the, greek, term, mytholog, a, was, then, borrowed, into, late, latin, occurring, in, the, title, of, latin, author, fulgentius, 5th, century, mythologi, to, denote, what, is, now, referred, to, as, classical, mythology, i, e, greco, roman, etiological, stories, involving, their, gods, fulgentius, mythologi, explicitly, treated, its, subject, matter, as, allegories, requiring, interpretation, and, not, as, true, events, the, latin, term, was, then, adopted, in, middle, french, as, mythologie, whether, from, french, or, latin, usage, english, adopted, the, word, mythology, in, the, 15th, century, initially, meaning, the, exposition, of, a, myth, or, myths, the, interpretation, of, fables, or, a, book, of, such, expositions, the, word, is, first, attested, in, john, lydgate, s, troy, book, c, 1425, from, lydgate, until, the, 17th, or, 18th, century, mythology, meant, a, moral, fable, allegory, or, a, parable, or, collection, of, traditional, stories, understood, to, be, false, it, came, eventually, to, be, applied, to, similar, bodies, of, traditional, stories, among, other, polytheistic, cultures, around, the, world, thus, mythology, entered, the, english, language, before, myth, johnson, s, dictionary, for, example, has, an, entry, for, mythology, but, not, for, myth, indeed, the, greek, loanword, mythos, pl, mythoi, and, latinate, mythus, pl, mythi, both, appeared, in, english, before, the, first, example, of, myth, in, 1830, the, main, characters, in, myths, are, usually, non, humans, such, as, gods, demigods, and, other, supernatural, figures, others, include, humans, animals, or, combinations, in, their, classification, of, myth, stories, of, everyday, humans, although, often, of, leaders, of, some, type, are, usually, contained, in, legends, as, opposed, to, myths, myths, are, sometimes, distinguished, from, legends, in, that, myths, deal, with, gods, usually, have, no, historical, basis, and, are, set, in, a, world, of, the, remote, past, very, different, from, that, of, the, present, definitions, of, myth, vary, to, some, extent, among, scholars, though, finnish, folklorist, lauri, honko, offers, a, widely, cited, definition, myth, a, story, of, the, gods, a, religious, account, of, the, beginning, of, the, world, the, creation, fundamental, events, the, exemplary, deeds, of, the, gods, as, a, result, of, which, the, world, nature, and, culture, were, created, together, with, all, parts, thereof, and, given, their, order, which, still, obtains, a, myth, expresses, and, confirms, society, s, religious, values, and, norms, it, provides, a, pattern, of, behavior, to, be, imitated, testifies, to, the, efficacy, of, ritual, with, its, practical, ends, and, establishes, the, sanctity, of, cult, another, definition, of, myth, comes, from, myth, criticism, theorist, and, professor, jos, manuel, losada, according, to, cultural, myth, criticism, the, studies, of, myth, must, explain, and, understand, myth, from, inside, that, is, only, as, a, myth, losada, defines, myth, as, a, functional, symbolic, and, thematic, narrative, of, one, or, several, extraordinary, events, with, a, transcendent, sacred, and, supernatural, referent, that, lacks, in, principle, historical, testimony, and, that, refers, to, an, individual, or, collective, but, always, absolute, cosmogony, or, eschatology, according, to, the, hylistic, myth, research, by, assyriologist, annette, zgoll, and, classic, philologist, christian, zgoll, a, myth, can, be, defined, as, an, erz, hlstoff, which, is, polymorphic, through, its, variants, and, depending, on, the, variant, polystratic, an, erz, hlstoff, in, which, transcending, interpretations, of, what, can, be, experienced, are, combined, into, a, hyleme, sequence, with, an, implicit, claim, to, relevance, for, the, interpretation, and, mastering, of, the, human, condition, scholars, in, other, fields, use, the, term, myth, in, varied, ways, in, a, broad, sense, the, word, can, refer, to, any, traditional, story, popular, misconception, or, imaginary, entity, though, myth, and, other, folklore, genres, may, overlap, myth, is, often, thought, to, differ, from, genres, such, as, legend, and, folktale, in, that, neither, are, considered, to, be, sacred, narratives, some, kinds, of, folktales, such, as, fairy, stories, are, not, considered, true, by, anyone, and, may, be, seen, as, distinct, from, myths, for, this, reason, main, characters, in, myths, are, usually, gods, demigods, or, supernatural, humans, while, legends, generally, feature, humans, as, their, main, characters, many, exceptions, and, combinations, exist, as, in, the, iliad, odyssey, and, aeneid, moreover, as, stories, spread, between, cultures, or, as, faiths, change, myths, can, come, to, be, considered, folktales, their, divine, characters, recast, as, either, as, humans, or, demihumans, such, as, giants, elves, and, faeries, conversely, historical, and, literary, material, may, acquire, mythological, qualities, over, time, for, example, the, matter, of, britain, the, legendary, history, of, great, britain, especially, those, focused, on, king, arthur, and, the, knights, of, the, round, table, and, the, matter, of, france, seem, distantly, to, originate, in, historical, events, of, the, 5th, and, 8th, centuries, respectively, and, became, mythologised, over, the, following, centuries, in, colloquial, use, myth, can, also, be, used, of, a, collectively, held, belief, that, has, no, basis, in, fact, or, any, false, story, this, usage, which, is, often, pejorative, arose, from, labelling, the, religious, myths, and, beliefs, of, other, cultures, as, incorrect, but, it, has, spread, to, cover, non, religious, beliefs, as, well, as, commonly, used, by, folklorists, and, academics, in, other, relevant, fields, such, as, anthropology, myth, has, no, implication, whether, the, narrative, may, be, understood, as, true, or, otherwise, among, biblical, scholars, of, both, the, old, and, new, testament, the, word, myth, has, a, technical, meaning, in, that, it, usually, refers, to, describe, the, actions, of, the, other, worldly, in, terms, of, this, world, such, as, the, creation, and, the, fall, since, myth, is, popularly, used, to, describe, stories, that, are, not, objectively, true, the, identification, of, a, narrative, as, a, myth, can, be, highly, controversial, many, religious, adherents, believe, that, the, narratives, told, in, their, respective, religious, traditions, are, historical, without, question, and, so, object, to, their, identification, as, myths, while, labelling, traditional, narratives, from, other, religions, as, such, hence, some, scholars, may, label, all, religious, narratives, as, myths, for, practical, reasons, such, as, to, avoid, depreciating, any, one, tradition, because, cultures, interpret, each, other, differently, relative, to, one, another, other, scholars, may, abstain, from, using, the, term, myth, altogether, for, purposes, of, avoiding, placing, pejorative, overtones, on, sacred, narratives, in, present, use, mythology, usually, refers, to, the, collection, of, myths, of, a, group, of, people, for, example, greek, mythology, roman, mythology, celtic, mythology, and, hittite, mythology, all, describe, the, body, of, myths, retold, among, those, cultures, mythology, can, also, refer, to, the, study, of, myths, and, mythologies, the, compilation, or, description, of, myths, is, sometimes, known, as, mythography, a, term, also, used, for, a, scholarly, anthology, of, myths, or, of, the, study, of, myths, generally, key, mythographers, in, the, classical, tradition, include, other, prominent, mythographies, include, the, thirteenth, century, prose, edda, attributed, to, the, icelander, snorri, sturluson, which, is, the, main, surviving, survey, of, norse, mythology, from, the, middle, ages, jeffrey, g, snodgrass, professor, of, anthropology, at, the, colorado, state, university, has, termed, india, s, bhats, as, mythographers, myth, criticism, is, a, system, of, anthropological, interpretation, of, culture, created, by, french, philosopher, gilbert, durand, scholars, have, used, myth, criticism, to, explain, the, mythical, roots, of, contemporary, fiction, which, means, that, modern, myth, criticism, needs, to, be, interdisciplinary, professor, losada, offers, his, own, methodologic, hermeneutic, and, epistemological, approach, to, myth, while, assuming, mythopoetical, perspectives, losada, s, cultural, myth, criticism, takes, a, step, further, incorporating, the, study, of, the, transcendent, dimension, its, function, its, disappearance, to, evaluate, the, role, of, myth, as, a, mirror, of, contemporary, culture, cultural, myth, criticism, cultural, myth, criticism, without, abandoning, the, analysis, of, the, symbolic, invades, all, cultural, manifestations, and, delves, into, the, difficulties, in, understanding, myth, today, this, cultural, myth, criticism, studies, mythical, manifestations, in, fields, as, wide, as, literature, film, and, television, theater, sculpture, painting, video, games, music, dancing, the, internet, and, other, artistic, fields, myth, criticism, a, discipline, that, studies, myths, mythology, contains, them, like, a, pantheon, its, statues, is, by, nature, interdisciplinary, it, combines, the, contributions, of, literary, theory, the, history, of, literature, the, fine, arts, and, the, new, ways, of, dissemination, in, the, age, of, communication, likewise, it, undertakes, its, object, of, study, from, its, interrelation, with, other, human, and, social, sciences, in, particular, sociology, anthropology, and, economics, the, need, for, an, approach, for, a, methodology, that, allows, us, to, understand, the, complexity, of, the, myth, and, its, manifestations, in, contemporary, times, is, justified, because, myth, is, sometimes, used, in, a, pejorative, sense, some, scholars, have, opted, for, mythos, instead, mythos, now, more, commonly, refers, to, its, aristotelian, sense, as, a, plot, point, or, to, a, body, of, interconnected, myths, or, stories, especially, those, belonging, to, a, particular, religious, or, cultural, tradition, it, is, sometimes, used, specifically, for, modern, fictional, mythologies, such, as, the, world, building, of, h, p, lovecraft, mythopoeia, mytho, poeia, i, make, myth, was, termed, by, j, r, r, tolkien, amongst, others, to, refer, to, the, conscious, generation, of, mythology, it, was, notoriously, also, suggested, separately, by, nazi, ideologist, alfred, rosenberg, comparative, mythology, is, a, systematic, comparison, of, myths, from, different, cultures, it, seeks, to, discover, underlying, themes, that, are, common, to, the, myths, of, multiple, cultures, in, some, cases, comparative, mythologists, use, the, similarities, between, separate, mythologies, to, argue, that, those, mythologies, have, a, common, source, this, source, may, inspire, myths, or, provide, a, common, protomythology, that, diverged, into, the, mythologies, of, each, culture, a, number, of, commentators, have, argued, that, myths, function, to, form, and, shape, society, and, social, behaviour, eliade, argued, that, one, of, the, foremost, functions, of, myth, is, to, establish, models, for, behavior, and, that, myths, may, provide, a, religious, experience, by, telling, or, reenacting, myths, members, of, traditional, societies, detach, themselves, from, the, present, returning, to, the, mythical, age, thereby, coming, closer, to, the, divine, honko, asserted, that, in, some, cases, a, society, reenacts, a, myth, in, an, attempt, to, reproduce, the, conditions, of, the, mythical, age, for, example, it, might, reenact, the, healing, performed, by, a, god, at, the, beginning, of, time, in, order, to, heal, someone, in, the, present, similarly, barthes, argued, that, modern, culture, explores, religious, experience, since, it, is, not, the, job, of, science, to, define, human, morality, a, religious, experience, is, an, attempt, to, connect, with, a, perceived, moral, past, which, is, in, contrast, with, the, technological, present, pattanaik, defines, mythology, as, the, subjective, truth, of, people, communicated, through, stories, symbols, and, rituals, he, says, facts, are, everybody, s, truth, fiction, is, nobody, s, truth, myths, are, somebody, s, truth, one, theory, claims, that, myths, are, distorted, accounts, of, historical, events, according, to, this, theory, storytellers, repeatedly, elaborate, upon, historical, accounts, until, the, figures, in, those, accounts, gain, the, status, of, gods, for, example, the, myth, of, the, wind, god, aeolus, may, have, evolved, from, a, historical, account, of, a, king, who, taught, his, people, to, use, sails, and, interpret, the, winds, herodotus, fifth, century, bce, and, prodicus, made, claims, of, this, kind, this, theory, is, named, euhemerism, after, mythologist, euhemerus, c, 320, bce, who, suggested, that, greek, gods, developed, from, legends, about, humans, some, theories, propose, that, myths, began, as, allegories, for, natural, phenomena, apollo, represents, the, sun, poseidon, represents, water, and, so, on, according, to, another, theory, myths, began, as, allegories, for, philosophical, or, spiritual, concepts, athena, represents, wise, judgment, aphrodite, romantic, desire, and, so, on, m, ller, supported, an, allegorical, theory, of, myth, he, believed, myths, began, as, allegorical, descriptions, of, nature, and, gradually, came, to, be, interpreted, literally, for, example, a, poetic, description, of, the, sea, as, raging, was, eventually, taken, literally, and, the, sea, was, then, thought, of, as, a, raging, god, some, thinkers, claimed, that, myths, result, from, the, personification, of, objects, and, forces, according, to, these, thinkers, the, ancients, worshiped, natural, phenomena, such, as, fire, and, air, gradually, deifying, them, for, example, according, to, this, theory, ancients, tended, to, view, things, as, gods, not, as, mere, objects, thus, they, described, natural, events, as, acts, of, personal, gods, giving, rise, to, myths, according, to, the, myth, ritual, theory, myth, is, tied, to, ritual, in, its, most, extreme, form, this, theory, claims, myths, arose, to, explain, rituals, this, claim, was, first, put, forward, by, smith, who, argued, that, people, begin, performing, rituals, for, reasons, not, related, to, myth, forgetting, the, original, reason, for, a, ritual, they, account, for, it, by, inventing, a, myth, and, claiming, the, ritual, commemorates, the, events, described, in, that, myth, james, george, frazer, author, of, the, golden, bough, a, book, on, the, comparative, study, of, mythology, and, religion, argued, that, humans, started, out, with, a, belief, in, magical, rituals, later, they, began, to, lose, faith, in, magic, and, invented, myths, about, gods, reinterpreting, their, rituals, as, religious, rituals, intended, to, appease, the, gods, historically, important, approaches, to, the, study, of, mythology, have, included, those, of, vico, schelling, schiller, jung, freud, l, vy, bruhl, l, vi, strauss, frye, the, soviet, school, and, the, myth, and, ritual, school, the, critical, interpretation, of, myth, began, with, the, presocratics, euhemerus, was, one, of, the, most, important, pre, modern, mythologists, he, interpreted, myths, as, accounts, of, actual, historical, events, though, distorted, over, many, retellings, sallustius, divided, myths, into, five, categories, plato, condemned, poetic, myth, when, discussing, education, in, the, republic, his, critique, was, primarily, on, the, grounds, that, the, uneducated, might, take, the, stories, of, gods, and, heroes, literally, nevertheless, he, constantly, referred, to, myths, throughout, his, writings, as, platonism, developed, in, the, phases, commonly, called, middle, platonism, and, neoplatonism, writers, such, as, plutarch, porphyry, proclus, olympiodorus, and, damascius, wrote, explicitly, about, the, symbolic, interpretation, of, traditional, and, orphic, myths, mythological, themes, were, consciously, employed, in, literature, beginning, with, homer, the, resulting, work, may, expressly, refer, to, a, mythological, background, without, itself, becoming, part, of, a, body, of, myths, cupid, and, psyche, medieval, romance, in, particular, plays, with, this, process, of, turning, myth, into, literature, euhemerism, as, stated, earlier, refers, to, the, rationalization, of, myths, putting, themes, formerly, imbued, with, mythological, qualities, into, pragmatic, contexts, an, example, of, this, would, be, following, a, cultural, or, religious, paradigm, shift, notably, the, re, interpretation, of, pagan, mythology, following, christianization, interest, in, polytheistic, mythology, revived, during, the, renaissance, with, early, works, of, mythography, appearing, in, the, sixteenth, century, among, them, the, theologia, mythologica, 1532, the, first, modern, western, scholarly, theories, of, myth, appeared, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, at, the, same, time, as, myth, was, adopted, as, a, scholarly, term, in, european, languages, they, were, driven, partly, by, a, new, interest, in, europe, s, ancient, past, and, vernacular, culture, associated, with, romantic, nationalism, and, epitomised, by, the, research, of, jacob, grimm, 1785, 1863, this, movement, drew, european, scholars, attention, not, only, to, classical, myths, but, also, material, now, associated, with, norse, mythology, finnish, mythology, and, so, forth, western, theories, were, also, partly, driven, by, europeans, efforts, to, comprehend, and, control, the, cultures, stories, and, religions, they, were, encountering, through, colonialism, these, encounters, included, both, extremely, old, texts, such, as, the, sanskrit, rigveda, and, the, sumerian, epic, of, gilgamesh, and, current, oral, narratives, such, as, mythologies, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, or, stories, told, in, traditional, african, religions, the, intellectual, context, for, nineteenth, century, scholars, was, profoundly, shaped, by, emerging, ideas, about, evolution, these, ideas, included, the, recognition, that, many, eurasian, languages, and, therefore, conceivably, stories, were, all, descended, from, a, lost, common, ancestor, the, indo, european, language, which, could, rationally, be, reconstructed, through, the, comparison, of, its, descendant, languages, they, also, included, the, idea, that, cultures, might, evolve, in, ways, comparable, to, species, in, general, 19th, century, theories, framed, myth, as, a, failed, or, obsolete, mode, of, thought, often, by, interpreting, myth, as, the, primitive, counterpart, of, modern, science, within, a, unilineal, framework, that, imagined, that, human, cultures, are, travelling, at, different, speeds, along, a, linear, path, of, cultural, development, one, of, the, dominant, mythological, theories, of, the, latter, 19th, century, was, nature, mythology, the, foremost, exponents, of, which, included, max, m, ller, and, edward, burnett, tylor, this, theory, posited, that, primitive, man, was, primarily, concerned, with, the, natural, world, it, tended, to, interpret, myths, that, seemed, distasteful, to, european, victorians, such, as, tales, about, sex, incest, or, cannibalism, as, metaphors, for, natural, phenomena, like, agricultural, fertility, unable, to, conceive, impersonal, natural, laws, early, humans, tried, to, explain, natural, phenomena, by, attributing, souls, to, inanimate, objects, thus, giving, rise, to, animism, according, to, tylor, human, thought, evolved, through, stages, starting, with, mythological, ideas, and, gradually, progressing, to, scientific, ideas, m, ller, also, saw, myth, as, originating, from, language, even, calling, myth, a, disease, of, language, he, speculated, that, myths, arose, due, to, the, lack, of, abstract, nouns, and, neuter, gender, in, ancient, languages, anthropomorphic, figures, of, speech, necessary, in, such, languages, were, eventually, taken, literally, leading, to, the, idea, that, natural, phenomena, were, in, actuality, conscious, or, divine, not, all, scholars, not, even, all, 19th, century, scholars, accepted, this, view, lucien, l, vy, bruhl, claimed, that, the, primitive, mentality, is, a, condition, of, the, human, mind, and, not, a, stage, in, its, historical, development, recent, scholarship, noting, the, fundamental, lack, of, evidence, for, nature, mythology, interpretations, among, people, who, actually, circulated, myths, has, likewise, abandoned, the, key, ideas, of, nature, mythology, frazer, saw, myths, as, a, misinterpretation, of, magical, rituals, which, were, themselves, based, on, a, mistaken, idea, of, natural, law, this, idea, was, central, to, the, myth, and, ritual, school, of, thought, according, to, frazer, humans, begin, with, an, unfounded, belief, in, impersonal, magical, laws, when, they, realize, applications, of, these, laws, do, not, work, they, give, up, their, belief, in, natural, law, in, favor, of, a, belief, in, personal, gods, controlling, nature, thus, giving, rise, to, religious, myths, meanwhile, humans, continue, practicing, formerly, magical, rituals, through, force, of, habit, reinterpreting, them, as, reenactments, of, mythical, events, finally, humans, come, to, realize, nature, follows, natural, laws, and, they, discover, their, true, nature, through, science, here, again, science, makes, myth, obsolete, as, humans, progress, from, magic, through, religion, to, science, segal, asserted, that, by, pitting, mythical, thought, against, modern, scientific, thought, such, theories, imply, modern, humans, must, abandon, myth, the, earlier, 20th, century, saw, major, work, developing, psychoanalytical, approaches, to, interpreting, myth, led, by, sigmund, freud, who, drawing, inspiration, from, classical, myth, began, developing, the, concept, of, the, oedipus, complex, in, his, 1899, the, interpretation, of, dreams, jung, likewise, tried, to, understand, the, psychology, behind, world, myths, jung, asserted, that, all, humans, share, certain, innate, unconscious, psychological, forces, which, he, called, archetypes, he, believed, similarities, between, the, myths, of, different, cultures, reveals, the, existence, of, these, universal, archetypes, the, mid, 20th, century, saw, the, influential, development, of, a, structuralist, theory, of, mythology, led, by, l, vi, strauss, strauss, argued, that, myths, reflect, patterns, in, the, mind, and, interpreted, those, patterns, more, as, fixed, mental, structures, specifically, pairs, of, opposites, good, evil, compassionate, callous, rather, than, unconscious, feelings, or, urges, meanwhile, bronislaw, malinowski, developed, analyses, of, myths, focusing, on, their, social, functions, in, the, real, world, he, is, associated, with, the, idea, that, myths, such, as, origin, stories, might, provide, a, mythic, charter, a, legitimisation, for, cultural, norms, and, social, institutions, thus, following, the, structuralist, era, c, 1960s, 1980s, the, predominant, anthropological, and, sociological, approaches, to, myth, increasingly, treated, myth, as, a, form, of, narrative, that, can, be, studied, interpreted, and, analyzed, like, ideology, history, and, culture, in, other, words, myth, is, a, form, of, understanding, and, telling, stories, that, are, connected, to, power, political, structures, and, political, and, economic, interests, these, approaches, contrast, with, approaches, such, as, those, of, joseph, campbell, and, eliade, which, hold, that, myth, has, some, type, of, essential, connection, to, ultimate, sacred, meanings, that, transcend, cultural, specifics, in, particular, myth, was, studied, in, relation, to, history, from, diverse, social, sciences, most, of, these, studies, share, the, assumption, that, history, and, myth, are, not, distinct, in, the, sense, that, history, is, factual, real, accurate, and, truth, while, myth, is, the, opposite, in, the, 1950s, barthes, published, a, series, of, essays, examining, modern, myths, and, the, process, of, their, creation, in, his, book, mythologies, which, stood, as, an, early, work, in, the, emerging, post, structuralist, approach, to, mythology, which, recognised, myths, existence, in, the, modern, world, and, in, popular, culture, the, 20th, century, saw, rapid, secularization, in, western, culture, this, made, western, scholars, more, willing, to, analyse, narratives, in, the, abrahamic, religions, as, myths, theologians, such, as, rudolf, bultmann, argued, that, a, modern, christianity, needed, to, demythologize, and, other, religious, scholars, embraced, the, idea, that, the, mythical, status, of, abrahamic, narratives, was, a, legitimate, feature, of, their, importance, this, in, his, appendix, to, myths, dreams, and, mysteries, and, in, the, myth, of, the, eternal, return, eliade, attributed, modern, humans, anxieties, to, their, rejection, of, myths, and, the, sense, of, the, sacred, the, christian, theologian, conrad, hyers, wrote, yth, today, has, come, to, have, negative, connotations, which, are, the, complete, opposite,
