https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality
morality, from, latin, moralitas, manner, character, proper, behavior, is, the, categorization, of, intentions, decisions, and, actions, into, those, that, are, proper, or, right, and, those, that, are, improper, or, wrong, morality, can, be, a, body, of, standards, or, principles, derived, from, a, code, of, conduct, from, a, particular, philosophy, religion, or, culture, or, it, can, derive, from, a, standard, that, is, understood, to, be, universal, morality, may, also, be, specifically, synonymous, with, goodness, appropriateness, or, rightness, moral, philosophy, includes, meta, ethics, which, studies, abstract, issues, such, as, moral, ontology, and, moral, epistemology, and, normative, ethics, which, studies, more, concrete, systems, of, moral, decision, making, such, as, deontological, ethics, and, consequentialism, an, example, of, normative, ethical, philosophy, is, the, golden, rule, which, states, one, should, treat, others, as, one, would, like, others, to, treat, oneself, immorality, is, the, active, opposition, to, morality, i, e, opposition, to, that, which, is, good, or, right, while, amorality, is, variously, defined, as, an, unawareness, of, indifference, toward, or, disbelief, in, any, particular, set, of, moral, standards, and, or, principles, ethics, also, known, as, moral, philosophy, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, which, addresses, questions, of, morality, the, word, ethics, is, commonly, used, interchangeably, with, morality, and, sometimes, it, is, used, more, narrowly, to, mean, the, moral, principles, of, a, particular, tradition, group, or, individual, likewise, certain, types, of, ethical, theories, especially, deontological, ethics, sometimes, distinguish, between, ethics, and, morality, philosopher, simon, blackburn, writes, that, although, the, morality, of, people, and, their, ethics, amounts, to, the, same, thing, there, is, a, usage, that, restricts, morality, to, systems, such, as, that, of, immanuel, kant, based, on, notions, such, as, duty, obligation, and, principles, of, conduct, reserving, ethics, for, the, more, aristotelian, approach, to, practical, reasoning, based, on, the, notion, of, a, virtue, and, generally, avoiding, the, separation, of, moral, considerations, from, other, practical, considerations, in, its, descriptive, sense, morality, refers, to, personal, or, cultural, values, codes, of, conduct, or, social, mores, from, a, society, that, provides, these, codes, of, conduct, in, which, it, applies, and, is, accepted, by, an, individual, it, does, not, connote, objective, claims, of, right, or, wrong, but, only, refers, to, that, which, is, considered, right, or, wrong, descriptive, ethics, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, which, studies, morality, in, this, sense, in, its, normative, sense, morality, refers, to, whatever, if, anything, is, actually, right, or, wrong, which, may, be, independent, of, the, values, or, mores, held, by, any, particular, peoples, or, cultures, normative, ethics, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, which, studies, morality, in, this, sense, philosophical, theories, on, the, nature, and, origins, of, morality, that, is, theories, of, meta, ethics, are, broadly, divided, into, two, classes, some, forms, of, non, cognitivism, and, ethical, subjectivism, while, considered, anti, realist, in, the, robust, sense, used, here, are, considered, realist, in, the, sense, synonymous, with, moral, universalism, for, example, universal, prescriptivism, is, a, universalist, form, of, non, cognitivism, which, claims, that, morality, is, derived, from, reasoning, about, implied, imperatives, and, divine, command, theory, and, ideal, observer, theory, are, universalist, forms, of, ethical, subjectivism, which, claim, that, morality, is, derived, from, the, edicts, of, a, god, or, the, hypothetical, decrees, of, a, perfectly, rational, being, respectively, practical, reason, is, necessary, for, the, moral, agency, but, it, is, not, a, sufficient, condition, for, moral, agency, real, life, issues, that, need, solutions, do, need, both, rationality, and, emotion, to, be, sufficiently, moral, one, uses, rationality, as, a, pathway, to, the, ultimate, decision, but, the, environment, and, emotions, towards, the, environment, at, the, moment, must, be, a, factor, for, the, result, to, be, truly, moral, as, morality, is, subject, to, culture, something, can, only, be, morally, acceptable, if, the, culture, as, a, whole, has, accepted, this, to, be, true, both, practical, reason, and, relevant, emotional, factors, are, acknowledged, as, significant, in, determining, the, morality, of, a, decision, celia, green, made, a, distinction, between, tribal, and, territorial, morality, she, characterizes, the, latter, as, predominantly, negative, and, proscriptive, it, defines, a, person, s, territory, including, his, or, her, property, and, dependents, which, is, not, to, be, damaged, or, interfered, with, apart, from, these, proscriptions, territorial, morality, is, permissive, allowing, the, individual, whatever, behaviour, does, not, interfere, with, the, territory, of, another, by, contrast, tribal, morality, is, prescriptive, imposing, the, norms, of, the, collective, on, the, individual, these, norms, will, be, arbitrary, culturally, dependent, and, flexible, whereas, territorial, morality, aims, at, rules, which, are, universal, and, absolute, such, as, kant, s, categorical, imperative, and, geisler, s, graded, absolutism, green, relates, the, development, of, territorial, morality, to, the, rise, of, the, concept, of, private, property, and, the, ascendancy, of, contract, over, status, some, observers, hold, that, individuals, apply, distinct, sets, of, moral, rules, to, people, depending, on, their, membership, of, an, in, group, the, individual, and, those, they, believe, to, be, of, the, same, group, or, an, out, group, people, not, entitled, to, be, treated, according, to, the, same, rules, some, biologists, anthropologists, and, evolutionary, psychologists, believe, this, in, group, out, group, discrimination, has, evolved, because, it, enhances, group, survival, this, belief, has, been, confirmed, by, simple, computational, models, of, evolution, in, simulations, this, discrimination, can, result, in, both, unexpected, cooperation, towards, the, in, group, and, irrational, hostility, towards, the, out, group, gary, r, johnson, and, v, s, falger, have, argued, that, nationalism, and, patriotism, are, forms, of, this, in, group, out, group, boundary, jonathan, haidt, has, noted, that, experimental, observation, indicating, an, in, group, criterion, provides, one, moral, foundation, substantially, used, by, conservatives, but, far, less, so, by, liberals, in, group, preference, is, also, helpful, at, the, individual, level, for, the, passing, on, of, one, s, genes, for, example, a, mother, who, favors, her, own, children, more, highly, than, the, children, of, other, people, will, give, greater, resources, to, her, children, than, she, will, to, strangers, thus, heightening, her, children, s, chances, of, survival, and, her, own, gene, s, chances, of, being, perpetuated, due, to, this, within, a, population, there, is, substantial, selection, pressure, exerted, toward, this, kind, of, self, interest, such, that, eventually, all, parents, wind, up, favoring, their, own, children, the, in, group, over, other, children, the, out, group, peterson, and, seligman, approach, the, anthropological, view, looking, across, cultures, geo, cultural, areas, and, across, millennia, they, conclude, that, certain, virtues, have, prevailed, in, all, cultures, they, examined, the, major, virtues, they, identified, include, wisdom, knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and, transcendence, each, of, these, include, several, divisions, for, instance, humanity, includes, love, kindness, and, social, intelligence, still, others, theorize, that, morality, is, not, always, absolute, contending, that, moral, issues, often, differ, along, cultural, lines, a, 2014, pew, research, study, among, several, nations, illuminates, significant, cultural, differences, among, issues, commonly, related, to, morality, including, divorce, extramarital, affairs, homosexuality, gambling, abortion, alcohol, use, contraceptive, use, and, premarital, sex, each, of, the, 40, countries, in, this, study, has, a, range, of, percentages, according, to, what, percentage, of, each, country, believes, the, common, moral, issues, are, acceptable, unacceptable, or, not, moral, issues, at, all, each, percentage, regarding, the, significance, of, the, moral, issue, varies, greatly, on, the, culture, in, which, the, moral, issue, is, presented, advocates, of, a, theory, known, as, moral, relativism, subscribe, to, the, notion, that, moral, virtues, are, right, or, wrong, only, within, the, context, of, a, certain, standpoint, e, g, cultural, community, in, other, words, what, is, morally, acceptable, in, one, culture, may, be, taboo, in, another, they, further, contend, that, no, moral, virtue, can, objectively, be, proven, right, or, wrong, critics, of, moral, relativism, point, to, historical, atrocities, such, as, infanticide, slavery, or, genocide, as, counter, arguments, noting, the, difficulty, in, accepting, these, actions, simply, through, cultural, lenses, fons, trompenaars, author, of, did, the, pedestrian, die, tested, members, of, different, cultures, with, various, moral, dilemmas, one, of, these, was, whether, the, driver, of, a, car, would, have, his, friend, a, passenger, riding, in, the, car, lie, in, order, to, protect, the, driver, from, the, consequences, of, driving, too, fast, and, hitting, a, pedestrian, trompenaars, found, that, different, cultures, had, quite, different, expectations, from, none, to, definite, anthropologists, from, oxford, s, institute, of, cognitive, evolutionary, anthropology, part, of, the, school, of, anthropology, museum, ethnography, analysed, ethnographic, accounts, of, ethics, from, 60, societies, comprising, over, 600, 000, words, from, over, 600, sources, and, discovered, what, they, believe, to, be, seven, universal, moral, rules, help, your, family, help, your, group, return, favours, be, brave, defer, to, superiors, divide, resources, fairly, and, respect, others, property, the, development, of, modern, morality, is, a, process, closely, tied, to, sociocultural, evolution, some, evolutionary, biologists, particularly, sociobiologists, believe, that, morality, is, a, product, of, evolutionary, forces, acting, at, an, individual, level, and, also, at, the, group, level, through, group, selection, although, to, what, degree, this, actually, occurs, is, a, controversial, topic, in, evolutionary, theory, some, sociobiologists, contend, that, the, set, of, behaviors, that, constitute, morality, evolved, largely, because, they, provided, possible, survival, or, reproductive, benefits, i, e, increased, evolutionary, success, humans, consequently, evolved, pro, social, emotions, such, as, feelings, of, empathy, or, guilt, in, response, to, these, moral, behaviors, on, this, understanding, moralities, are, sets, of, self, perpetuating, and, biologically, driven, behaviors, which, encourage, human, cooperation, biologists, contend, that, all, social, animals, from, ants, to, elephants, have, modified, their, behaviors, by, restraining, immediate, selfishness, in, order, to, improve, their, evolutionary, fitness, human, morality, although, sophisticated, and, complex, relative, to, the, moralities, of, other, animals, is, essentially, a, natural, phenomenon, that, evolved, to, restrict, excessive, individualism, that, could, undermine, a, group, s, cohesion, and, thereby, reducing, the, individuals, fitness, on, this, view, moral, codes, are, ultimately, founded, on, emotional, instincts, and, intuitions, that, were, selected, for, in, the, past, because, they, aided, survival, and, reproduction, inclusive, fitness, examples, the, maternal, bond, is, selected, for, because, it, improves, the, survival, of, offspring, the, westermarck, effect, where, close, proximity, during, early, years, reduces, mutual, sexual, attraction, underpins, taboos, against, incest, because, it, decreases, the, likelihood, of, genetically, risky, behaviour, such, as, inbreeding, the, phenomenon, of, reciprocity, in, nature, is, seen, by, evolutionary, biologists, as, one, way, to, begin, to, understand, human, morality, its, function, is, typically, to, ensure, a, reliable, supply, of, essential, resources, especially, for, animals, living, in, a, habitat, where, food, quantity, or, quality, fluctuates, unpredictably, for, example, some, vampire, bats, fail, to, feed, on, prey, some, nights, while, others, manage, to, consume, a, surplus, bats, that, did, eat, will, then, regurgitate, part, of, their, blood, meal, to, save, a, conspecific, from, starvation, since, these, animals, live, in, close, knit, groups, over, many, years, an, individual, can, count, on, other, group, members, to, return, the, favor, on, nights, when, it, goes, hungry, wilkinson, 1984, marc, bekoff, and, jessica, pierce, 2009, have, argued, that, morality, is, a, suite, of, behavioral, capacities, likely, shared, by, all, mammals, living, in, complex, social, groups, e, g, wolves, coyotes, elephants, dolphins, rats, chimpanzees, they, define, morality, as, a, suite, of, interrelated, other, regarding, behaviors, that, cultivate, and, regulate, complex, interactions, within, social, groups, this, suite, of, behaviors, includes, empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and, a, sense, of, fairness, in, related, work, it, has, been, convincingly, demonstrated, that, chimpanzees, show, empathy, for, each, other, in, a, wide, variety, of, contexts, they, also, possess, the, ability, to, engage, in, deception, and, a, level, of, social, politics, prototypical, of, our, own, tendencies, for, gossip, and, reputation, management, christopher, boehm, 1982, has, hypothesized, that, the, incremental, development, of, moral, complexity, throughout, hominid, evolution, was, due, to, the, increasing, need, to, avoid, disputes, and, injuries, in, moving, to, open, savanna, and, developing, stone, weapons, other, theories, are, that, increasing, complexity, was, simply, a, correlate, of, increasing, group, size, and, brain, size, and, in, particular, the, development, of, theory, of, mind, abilities, in, modern, moral, psychology, morality, is, sometimes, considered, to, change, through, personal, development, several, psychologists, have, produced, theories, on, the, development, of, morals, usually, going, through, stages, of, different, morals, lawrence, kohlberg, jean, piaget, and, elliot, turiel, have, cognitive, developmental, approaches, to, moral, development, to, these, theorists, morality, forms, in, a, series, of, constructive, stages, or, domains, in, the, ethics, of, care, approach, established, by, carol, gilligan, moral, development, occurs, in, the, context, of, caring, mutually, responsive, relationships, which, are, based, on, interdependence, particularly, in, parenting, but, also, in, social, relationships, generally, social, psychologists, such, as, martin, hoffman, and, jonathan, haidt, emphasize, social, and, emotional, development, based, on, biology, such, as, empathy, moral, identity, theorists, such, as, william, damon, and, mordechai, nisan, see, moral, commitment, as, arising, from, the, development, of, a, self, identity, that, is, defined, by, moral, purposes, this, moral, self, identity, leads, to, a, sense, of, responsibility, to, pursue, such, purposes, of, historical, interest, in, psychology, are, the, theories, of, psychoanalysts, such, as, sigmund, freud, who, believe, that, moral, development, is, the, product, of, aspects, of, the, super, ego, as, guilt, shame, avoidance, theories, of, moral, development, therefore, tend, to, regard, it, as, positive, moral, development, the, higher, stages, are, morally, higher, though, this, naturally, involves, a, circular, argument, the, higher, stages, are, better, because, they, are, higher, but, the, better, higher, because, they, are, better, as, an, alternative, to, viewing, morality, as, an, individual, trait, some, sociologists, as, well, as, social, and, discursive, psychologists, have, taken, upon, themselves, to, study, the, in, vivo, aspects, of, morality, by, examining, how, persons, conduct, themselves, in, social, interaction, a, new, study, analyses, the, common, perception, of, a, decline, in, morality, in, societies, worldwide, and, throughout, history, adam, m, mastroianni, and, daniel, t, gilbert, present, a, series, of, studies, indicating, that, the, perception, of, moral, decline, is, an, illusion, and, easily, produced, with, implications, for, misallocation, of, resources, underuse, of, social, support, and, social, influence, to, begin, with, the, authors, demonstrate, that, people, in, no, less, than, 60, nations, hold, the, belief, that, morality, is, deteriorating, continuously, and, this, conviction, has, been, present, for, the, last, 70, years, subsequently, they, indicate, that, people, ascribe, this, decay, to, the, declining, morality, of, individuals, as, they, age, and, the, succeeding, generations, thirdly, the, authors, demonstrate, that, people, s, evaluations, of, the, morality, of, their, peers, have, not, decreased, over, time, indicating, that, the, belief, in, moral, decline, is, an, illusion, lastly, the, authors, explain, a, basic, psychological, mechanism, that, uses, two, well, established, phenomena, distorted, exposure, to, information, and, distorted, memory, of, information, to, cause, the, illusion, of, moral, decline, the, authors, present, studies, that, validate, some, of, the, predictions, about, the, circumstances, in, which, the, perception, of, moral, decline, is, attenuated, eliminated, or, reversed, e, g, when, participants, are, asked, about, the, morality, of, people, closest, to, them, or, people, who, lived, before, they, were, born, moral, cognition, refers, to, cognitive, processes, implicated, in, moral, judgment, and, decision, making, and, moral, action, it, consists, of, several, domain, general, cognitive, processes, ranging, from, perception, of, a, morally, salient, stimulus, to, reasoning, when, faced, with, a, moral, dilemma, while, it, is, important, to, mention, that, there, is, not, a, single, cognitive, faculty, dedicated, exclusively, to, moral, cognition, characterizing, the, contributions, of, domain, general, processes, to, moral, behavior, is, a, critical, scientific, endeavor, to, understand, how, morality, works, and, how, it, can, be, improved, cognitive, psychologists, and, neuroscientists, investigate, the, inputs, to, these, cognitive, processes, and, their, interactions, as, well, as, how, these, contribute, to, moral, behavior, by, running, controlled, experiments, in, these, experiments, putatively, moral, versus, nonmoral, stimuli, are, compared, to, each, other, while, controlling, for, other, variables, such, as, content, or, working, memory, load, often, the, differential, neural, response, to, specifically, moral, statements, or, scenes, are, examined, using, functional, neuroimaging, experiments, critically, the, specific, cognitive, processes, that, are, involved, depend, on, the, prototypical, situation, that, a, person, encounters, for, instance, while, situations, that, require, an, active, decision, on, a, moral, dilemma, may, require, active, reasoning, an, immediate, reaction, to, a, shocking, moral, violation, may, involve, quick, affect, laden, processes, nonetheless, certain, cognitive, skills, such, as, being, able, to, attribute, mental, states, beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, to, oneself, and, others, is, a, common, feature, of, a, broad, range, of, prototypical, situations, in, line, with, this, a, meta, analysis, found, overlapping, activity, between, moral, emotion, and, moral, reasoning, tasks, suggesting, a, shared, neural, network, for, both, tasks, the, results, of, this, meta, analysis, however, also, demonstrated, that, the, processing, of, moral, input, is, affected, by, task, demands, regarding, the, issues, of, morality, in, video, games, some, scholars, believe, that, because, players, appear, in, video, games, as, actors, they, maintain, a, distance, between, their, sense, of, self, and, the, role, of, the, game, in, terms, of, imagination, therefore, the, decision, making, and, moral, behavior, of, players, in, the, game, are, not, representing, player, s, moral, dogma, it, has, been, recently, found, that, moral, judgment, consists, in, concurrent, evaluations, of, three, different, components, that, align, with, precepts, from, three, dominant, moral, theories, virtue, ethics, deontology, and, consequentialism, the, character, of, a, person, agent, component, a, their, actions, deed, component, d, and, the, consequences, brought, about, in, the, situation, consequences, component, c, this, implies, that, various, inputs, of, the, situation, a, person, encounters, affect, moral, cognition, jonathan, haidt, distinguishes, between, two, types, of, moral, cognition, moral, intuition, and, moral, reasoning, moral, intuition, involves, the, fast, automatic, and, affective, processes, that, result, in, an, evaluative, feeling, of, good, bad, or, like, dislike, without, awareness, of, going, through, any, steps, conversely, moral, reasoning, does, involve, conscious, mental, activity, to, reach, a, moral, judgment, moral, reasoning, is, controlled, and, less, affective, than, moral, intuition, when, making, moral, judgments, humans, perform, moral, reasoning, to, support, their, initial, intuitive, feeling, however, there, are, three, ways, humans, can, override, their, immediate, intuitive, response, the, first, way, is, conscious, verbal, reasoning, for, example, examining, costs, and, benefits, the, second, way, is, reframing, a, situation, to, see, a, new, perspective, or, consequence, which, triggers, a, different, intuition, finally, one, can, talk, to, other, people, which, illuminates, new, arguments, in, fact, interacting, with, other, people, is, the, cause, of, most, moral, change, the, brain, areas, that, are, consistently, involved, when, humans, reason, about, moral, issues, have, been, investigated, by, multiple, quantitative, large, scale, meta, analyses, of, the, brain, activity, changes, reported, in, the, moral, neuroscience, literature, the, neural, network, underlying, moral, decisions, overlaps, with, the, network, pertaining, to, representing, others, intentions, i, e, theory, of, mind, and, the, network, pertaining, to, representing, others, vicariously, experienced, emotional, states, i, e, empathy, this, supports, the, notion, that, moral, reasoning, is, related, to, both, seeing, things, from, other, persons, points, of, view, and, to, grasping, others, feelings, these, results, provide, evidence, that, the, neural, network, underlying, moral, decisions, is, probably, domain, global, i, e, there, might, be, no, such, things, as, a, moral, module, in, the, human, brain, and, might, be, dissociable, into, cognitive, and, affective, sub, systems, cognitive, neuroscientist, jean, decety, thinks, that, the, ability, to, recognize, and, vicariously, experience, what, another, individual, is, undergoing, was, a, key, step, forward, in, the, evolution, of, social, behavior, and, ultimately, morality, the, inability, to, feel, empathy, is, one, of, the, defining, characteristics, of, psychopathy, and, this, would, appear, to, lend, support, to, decety, s, view, recently, drawing, on, empirical, research, in, evolutionary, theory, developmental, psychology, social, neuroscience, and, psychopathy, jean, decety, argued, that, empathy, and, morality, are, neither, systematically, opposed, to, one, another, nor, inevitably, complementary, an, essential, shared, component, of, moral, judgment, involves, the, capacity, to, detect, morally, salient, content, within, a, given, social, context, recent, research, implicated, the, salience, network, in, this, initial, detection, of, moral, content, the, salience, network, responds, to, behaviorally, salient, events, and, may, be, critical, to, modulate, downstream, default, and, frontal, control, network, interactions, in, the, service, of, complex, moral, reasoning, and, decision, making, processes, the, explicit, making, of, moral, right, and, wrong, judgments, coincides, with, activation, in, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, vmpc, a, region, involved, in, valuation, while, intuitive, reactions, to, situations, containing, implicit, moral, issues, activates, the, temporoparietal, junction, area, a, region, that, plays, a, key, role, in, understanding, intentions, and, beliefs, stimulation, of, the, vmpc, by, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, or, neurological, lesion, has, been, shown, to, inhibit, the, ability, of, human, subjects, to, take, into, account, intent, when, forming, a, moral, judgment, according, to, such, investigations, tms, did, not, disrupt, participants, ability, to, make, any, moral, judgment, on, the, contrary, moral, judgments, of, intentional, harms, and, non, harms, were, unaffected, by, tms, to, either, the, rtpj, or, the, control, site, presumably, however, people, typically, make, moral, judgments, of, intentional, harms, by, considering, not, only, the, action, s, harmful, outcome, but, the, agent, s, intentions, and, beliefs, so, why, were, moral, judgments, of, intentional, harms, not, affected, by, tms, to, the, rtpj, one, possibility, is, that, moral, judgments, typically, reflect, a, weighted, function, of, any, morally, relevant, information, that, is, available, at, the, time, based, on, this, view, when, information, concerning, the, agent, s, belief, is, unavailable, or, degraded, the, resulting, moral, judgment, simply, reflects, a, higher, weighting, of, other, morally, relevant, factors, e, g, outcome, alternatively, following, tms, to, the, rtpj, moral, judgments, might, be, made, via, an, abnormal, processing, route, that, does, not, take, belief, into, account, on, either, account, when, belief, information, is, degraded, or, unavailable, moral, judgments, are, shifted, toward, other, morally, relevant, factors, e, g, outcome, for, intentional, harms, and, non, harms, however, the, outcome, suggests, the, same, moral, judgment, as, to, the, intention, thus, the, researchers, suggest, that, tms, to, the, rtpj, disrupted, the, processing, of, negative, beliefs, for, both, intentional, harms, and, attempted, harms, but, the, current, design, allowed, the, investigators, to, detect, this, effect, only, in, the, case, of, attempted, harms, in, which, the, neutral, outcomes, did, not, afford, harsh, moral, judgments, on, their, own, similarly, individuals, with, a, lesion, of, the, vmpc, judge, an, action, purely, on, its, outcome, and, are, unable, to, take, into, account, the, intent, of, that, action, moral, intuitions, may, have, genetic, bases, a, 2022, study, conducted, by, scholars, michael, zakharin, and, timothy, c, bates, and, published, by, the, european, journal, of, personality, found, that, moral, foundations, have, significant, genetic, bases, another, study, conducted, by, smith, and, hatemi, similarly, found, significant, evidence, in, support, of, moral, heritability, by, looking, at, and, comparing, the, answers, of, moral, dilemmas, between, twins, genetics, play, a, role, in, influencing, prosocial, behaviors, and, moral, decision, making, genetics, contribute, to, the, development, and, expression, of, certain, traits, and, behaviors, including, those, related, to, morality, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, while, genetics, play, a, role, in, shaping, certain, aspects, of, moral, behavior, morality, itself, is, a, multifaceted, concept, that, encompasses, cultural, societal, and, personal, influences, as, well, if, morality, is, the, answer, to, the, question, how, ought, we, to, live, at, the, individual, level, politics, can, be, seen, as, addressing, the, same, question, at, the, social, level, though, the, political, sphere, raises, additional, problems, and, challenges, it, is, therefore, unsurprising, that, evidence, has, been, found, of, a, relationship, between, attitudes, in, morality, and, politics, moral, foundations, theory, authored, by, jonathan, haidt, and, colleagues, has, been, used, to, study, the, differences, between, liberals, and, conservatives, in, this, regard, haidt, found, that, americans, who, identified, as, liberals, tended, to, value, care, and, fairness, higher, than, loyalty, respect, and, purity, self, identified, conservative, americans, valued, care, and, fairness, less, and, the, remaining, three, values, more, both, groups, gave, care, the, highest, over, all, weighting, but, conservatives, valued, fairness, the, lowest, whereas, liberals, valued, purity, the, lowest, haidt, also, hypothesizes, that, the, origin, of, this, division, in, the, united, states, can, be, traced, to, geo, historical, factors, with, conservatism, strongest, in, closely, knit, ethnically, homogeneous, communities, in, contrast, to, port, cities, where, the, cultural, mix, is, greater, thus, requiring, more, liberalism, group, morality, develops, from, shared, concepts, and, beliefs, and, is, often, codified, to, regulate, behavior, within, a, culture, or, community, various, defined, actions, come, to, be, called, moral, or, immoral, individuals, who, choose, moral, action, are, popularly, held, to, possess, moral, fiber, whereas, those, who, indulge, in, immoral, behavior, may, be, labeled, as, socially, degenerate, the, continued, existence, of, a, group, may, depend, on, widespread, conformity, to, codes, of, morality, an, inability, to, adjust, moral, codes, in, response, to, new, challenges, is, sometimes, credited, with, the, demise, of, a, community, a, positive, example, would, be, the, function, of, cistercian, reform, in, reviving, monasticism, a, negative, example, would, be, the, role, of, the, dowager, empress, in, the, subjugation, of, china, to, european, interests, within, nationalist, movements, there, has, been, some, tendency, to, feel, that, a, nation, will, not, survive, or, prosper, without, acknowledging, one, common, morality, regardless, of, its, content, political, morality, is, also, relevant, to, the, behavior, internationally, of, national, governments, and, to, the, support, they, receive, from, their, host, population, the, sentience, institute, co, founded, by, jacy, reese, anthis, analyzes, the, trajectory, of, moral, progress, in, society, via, the, framework, of, an, expanding, moral, circle, noam, chomsky, states, that, if, we, adopt, the, principle, of, universality, if, an, action, is, right, or, wrong, for, others, it, is, right, or, wrong, for, us, those, who, do, not, rise, to, the, minimal, moral, level, of, applying, to, themselves, the, standards, they, apply, to, others, more, stringent, ones, in, fact, plainly, cannot, be, taken, seriously, when, they, speak, of, appropriateness, of, response, or, of, right, and, wrong, good, and, evil, in, fact, one, of, them, maybe, the, most, elementary, of, moral, principles, is, that, of, universality, that, is, if, something, s, right, for, me, it, s, right, for, you, if, it, s, wrong, for, you, it, s, wrong, for, me, any, moral, code, that, is, even, worth, looking, at, has, that, at, its, core, somehow, religion, and, morality, are, not, synonymous, morality, does, not, depend, upon, religion, although, for, some, this, is, an, almost, automatic, assumption, according, to, the, westminster, dictionary, of, christian, ethics, religion, and, morality, are, to, be, defined, differently, and, have, no, definitional, connections, with, each, other, conceptually, and, in, principle, morality, and, a, religious, value, system, are, two, distinct, kinds, of, value, systems, or, action, guides, within, the, wide, range, of, moral, traditions, religious, value, systems, co, exist, with, contemporary, secular, frameworks, such, as, consequentialism, freethought, humanism, utilitarianism, and, others, there, are, many, types, of, religious, value, systems, modern, monotheistic, religions, such, as, islam, judaism, christianity, and, to, a, certain, degree, others, such, as, sikhism, and, zoroastrianism, define, right, and, wrong, by, the, laws, and, rules, as, set, forth, by, their, respective, scriptures, and, as, interpreted, by, religious, leaders, within, each, respective, faith, other, religions, spanning, pantheistic, to, nontheistic, tend, to, be, less, absolute, for, example, within, buddhism, the, intention, of, the, individual, and, the, circumstances, should, be, accounted, for, in, the, form, of, merit, to, determine, if, an, action, is, termed, right, or, wrong, barbara, stoler, miller, points, out, a, further, disparity, between, the, values, of, religious, traditions, stating, that, in, hinduism, practically, right, and, wrong, are, decided, according, to, the, categories, of, social, rank, kinship, and, stages, of, life, for, modern, westerners, who, have, been, raised, on, ideals, of, universality, and, egalitarianism, this, relativity, of, values, and, obligations, is, the, aspect, of, hinduism, most, difficult, to, understand, religions, provide, different, ways, of, dealing, with, moral, dilemmas, for, example, hinduism, lacks, any, absolute, prohibition, on, killing, recognizing, that, it, may, be, inevitable, and, indeed, necessary, in, certain, circumstances, monotheistic, traditions, view, certain, acts, such, as, abortion, or, divorce, in, more, absolute, terms, religion, is, not, always, positively, associated, with, morality, philosopher, david, hume, stated, that, the, greatest, crimes, have, been, found, in, many, instances, to, be, compatible, with, a, superstitious, piety, and, devotion, hence, it, is, justly, regarded, as, unsafe, to, draw, any, inference, in, favor, of, a, man, s, morals, from, the, fervor, or, strictness, of, his, religious, exercises, even, though, he, himself, believe, them, sincere, religious, value, systems, can, be, used, to, justify, acts, that, are, contrary, to, general, contemporary, morality, such, as, massacres, misogyny, and, slavery, for, example, simon, blackburn, states, that, apologists, for, hinduism, defend, or, explain, away, its, involvement, with, the, caste, system, and, apologists, for, islam, defend, or, explain, away, its, harsh, penal, code, or, its, attitude, to, women, and, infidels, in, regard, to, christianity, he, states, that, the, bible, can, be, read, as, giving, us, a, carte, blanche, for, harsh, attitudes, to, children, the, mentally, handicapped, animals, the, environment, the, divorced, unbelievers, people, with, various, sexual, habits, and, elderly, women, and, notes, morally, suspect, themes, in, the, bible, s, new, testament, as, well, elizabeth, anderson, likewise, holds, that, the, bible, contains, both, good, and, evil, teachings, and, it, is, morally, inconsistent, christian, apologists, address, blackburn, s, viewpoints, and, construe, that, jewish, laws, in, the, hebrew, bible, showed, the, evolution, of, moral, standards, towards, protecting, the, vulnerable, imposing, a, death, penalty, on, those, pursuing, slavery, and, treating, slaves, as, persons, and, not, as, property, humanists, like, paul, kurtz, believe, that, we, can, identify, moral, values, across, cultures, even, if, we, do, not, appeal, to, a, supernatural, or, universalist, understanding, of, principles, values, including, integrity, trustworthiness, benevolence, and, fairness, these, values, can, be, resources, for, finding, common, ground, between, believers, and, nonbelievers, several, studies, have, been, conducted, on, the, empirics, of, morality, in, various, countries, and, the, overall, relationship, between, faith, and, crime, is, unclear, a, 2001, review, of, studies, on, this, topic, found, the, existing, evidence, surrounding, the, effect, of, religion, on, crime, is, varied, contested, and, inconclusive, and, currently, no, persuasive, answer, exists, as, to, the, empirical, relationship, between, religion, and, crime, phil, zuckerman, s, 2008, book, society, without, god, based, on, studies, conducted, during, 14, months, in, scandinavia, in, 2005, 2006, notes, that, denmark, and, sweden, which, are, probably, the, least, religious, countries, in, the, world, and, possibly, in, the, history, of, the, world, enjoy, among, the, lowest, violent, crime, rates, in, the, world, the, lowest, levels, of, corruption, in, the, world, dozens, of, studies, have, been, conducted, on, this, topic, since, the, twentieth, century, a, 2005, study, by, gregory, s, paul, published, in, the, journal, of, religion, and, society, stated, that, in, general, higher, rates, of, belief, in, and, worship, of, a, creator, correlate, with, higher, rates, of, homicide, juvenile, and, early, adult, mortality, std, infection, rates, teen, pregnancy, and, abortion, in, the, prosperous, democracies, and, in, all, secular, developing, democracies, a, centuries, long, term, trend, has, seen, homicide, rates, drop, to, historical, lows, with, the, exceptions, being, the, united, states, with, a, high, religiosity, level, and, theistic, portugal, in, a, response, gary, jensen, builds, on, and, refines, paul, s, study, he, concludes, that, a, complex, relationship, exists, between, religiosity, and, homicide, with, some, dimensions, of, religiosity, encouraging, homicide, and, other, dimensions, discouraging, it, in, april, 2012, the, results, of, a, study, which, tested, their, subjects, pro, social, sentiments, were, published, in, the, social, psychological, and, personality, science, journal, in, which, non, religious, people, had, higher, scores, showing, that, they, were, more, motivated, by, their, own, compassion, to, perform, pro, social, behaviors, religious, people, were, found, to, be, less, motivated, by, compassion, to, be, charitable, than, by, an, inner, sense, of, moral, obligation
