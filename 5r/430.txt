a, utopia, j, u, t, o, p, i, yoo, toh, pee, typically, describes, an, imaginary, community, or, society, that, possesses, highly, desirable, or, near, perfect, qualities, for, its, members, it, was, coined, by, sir, thomas, more, for, his, 1516, book, utopia, which, describes, a, fictional, island, society, in, the, new, world, hypothetical, utopias, focus, on, among, other, things, equality, in, categories, such, as, economics, government, and, justice, with, the, method, and, structure, of, proposed, implementation, varying, according, to, ideology, lyman, tower, sargent, argues, that, the, nature, of, a, utopia, is, inherently, contradictory, because, societies, are, not, homogeneous, and, have, desires, which, conflict, and, therefore, cannot, simultaneously, be, satisfied, to, quote, there, are, socialist, capitalist, monarchical, democratic, anarchist, ecological, feminist, patriarchal, egalitarian, hierarchical, racist, left, wing, right, wing, reformist, free, love, nuclear, family, extended, family, gay, lesbian, and, many, more, utopias, utopianism, some, argue, is, essential, for, the, improvement, of, the, human, condition, but, if, used, wrongly, it, becomes, dangerous, utopia, has, an, inherent, contradictory, nature, here, the, opposite, of, a, utopia, is, a, dystopia, utopian, and, dystopian, fiction, has, become, a, popular, literary, category, despite, being, common, parlance, for, something, imaginary, utopianism, inspired, and, was, inspired, by, some, reality, based, fields, and, concepts, such, as, architecture, file, sharing, social, networks, universal, basic, income, communes, open, borders, and, even, pirate, bases, the, word, utopia, was, coined, in, 1516, from, ancient, greek, by, the, englishman, sir, thomas, more, for, his, latin, text, utopia, it, literally, translates, as, no, place, coming, from, the, greek, not, and, place, and, meant, any, non, existent, society, when, described, in, considerable, detail, however, in, standard, usage, the, word, s, meaning, has, shifted, and, now, usually, describes, a, non, existent, society, that, is, intended, to, be, viewed, as, considerably, better, than, contemporary, society, in, his, original, work, more, carefully, pointed, out, the, similarity, of, the, word, to, eutopia, meaning, good, place, from, greek, good, or, well, and, place, which, ostensibly, would, be, the, more, appropriate, term, for, the, concept, in, modern, english, the, pronunciations, of, eutopia, and, utopia, in, english, are, identical, which, may, have, given, rise, to, the, change, in, meaning, dystopia, a, term, meaning, bad, place, coined, in, 1868, draws, on, this, latter, meaning, the, opposite, of, a, utopia, dystopia, is, a, concept, which, surpassed, utopia, in, popularity, in, the, fictional, literature, from, the, 1950s, onwards, chiefly, because, of, the, impact, of, george, orwell, s, nineteen, eighty, four, in, 1876, writer, charles, renouvier, published, a, novel, called, uchronia, french, uchronie, the, neologism, using, chronos, instead, of, topos, has, since, been, used, to, refer, to, non, existent, idealized, times, in, fiction, such, as, philip, roth, s, the, plot, against, america, 2004, and, philip, k, dick, s, the, man, in, the, high, castle, 1962, according, to, the, philosophical, dictionary, proto, utopian, ideas, begin, as, early, as, the, period, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, medieval, heretics, peasant, revolts, and, establish, themselves, in, the, period, of, the, early, capitalism, reformation, and, renaissance, hus, m, ntzer, more, campanella, democratic, revolutions, meslier, morelly, mably, winstanley, later, babeufists, blanquists, and, in, a, period, of, turbulent, development, of, capitalism, that, highlighted, antagonisms, of, capitalist, society, saint, simon, fourier, owen, cabet, lamennais, proudhon, and, their, followers, famous, quotes, from, writers, and, characters, about, utopia, utopian, socialist, tienne, cabet, in, his, utopian, book, the, voyage, to, icaria, cited, the, definition, from, the, contemporary, dictionary, of, ethical, and, political, sciences, utopias, and, other, models, of, government, based, on, the, public, good, may, be, inconceivable, because, of, the, disordered, human, passions, which, under, the, wrong, governments, seek, to, highlight, the, poorly, conceived, or, selfish, interest, of, the, community, but, even, though, we, find, it, impossible, they, are, ridiculous, to, sinful, people, whose, sense, of, self, destruction, prevents, them, from, believing, marx, and, engels, used, the, word, utopia, to, denote, unscientific, social, theories, philosopher, slavoj, i, ek, told, about, utopia, which, means, that, we, should, reinvent, utopia, but, in, what, sense, there, are, two, false, meanings, of, utopia, one, is, this, old, notion, of, imagining, this, ideal, society, we, know, will, never, be, realized, the, other, is, the, capitalist, utopia, in, the, sense, of, new, perverse, desire, that, you, are, not, only, allowed, but, even, solicited, to, realize, the, true, utopia, is, when, the, situation, is, so, without, issue, without, the, way, to, resolve, it, within, the, coordinates, of, the, possible, that, out, of, the, pure, urge, of, survival, you, have, to, invent, a, new, space, utopia, is, not, kind, of, a, free, imagination, utopia, is, a, matter, of, inner, most, urgency, you, are, forced, to, imagine, it, it, is, the, only, way, out, and, this, is, what, we, need, today, philosopher, milan, ime, ka, said, utopism, was, a, common, type, of, thinking, at, the, dawn, of, human, civilization, we, find, utopian, beliefs, in, the, oldest, religious, imaginations, appear, regularly, in, the, neighborhood, of, ancient, yet, pre, philosophical, views, on, the, causes, and, meaning, of, natural, events, the, purpose, of, creation, the, path, of, good, and, evil, happiness, and, misfortune, fairy, tales, and, legends, later, inspired, by, poetry, and, philosophy, the, underlying, motives, on, which, utopian, literature, is, built, are, as, old, as, the, entire, historical, epoch, of, human, history, philosopher, richard, stahel, said, every, social, organization, relies, on, something, that, is, not, realized, or, feasible, but, has, the, ideal, that, is, somewhere, beyond, the, horizon, a, lighthouse, to, which, it, may, seek, to, approach, if, it, considers, that, ideal, socially, valid, and, generally, accepted, chronologically, the, first, recorded, utopian, proposal, is, plato, s, republic, part, conversation, part, fictional, depiction, and, part, policy, proposal, republic, would, categorize, citizens, into, a, rigid, class, structure, of, golden, silver, bronze, and, iron, socioeconomic, classes, the, golden, citizens, are, trained, in, a, rigorous, 50, year, long, educational, program, to, be, benign, oligarchs, the, philosopher, kings, plato, stressed, this, structure, many, times, in, statements, and, in, his, published, works, such, as, the, republic, the, wisdom, of, these, rulers, will, supposedly, eliminate, poverty, and, deprivation, through, fairly, distributed, resources, though, the, details, on, how, to, do, this, are, unclear, the, educational, program, for, the, rulers, is, the, central, notion, of, the, proposal, it, has, few, laws, no, lawyers, and, rarely, sends, its, citizens, to, war, but, hires, mercenaries, from, among, its, war, prone, neighbors, these, mercenaries, were, deliberately, sent, into, dangerous, situations, in, the, hope, that, the, more, warlike, populations, of, all, surrounding, countries, will, be, weeded, out, leaving, peaceful, peoples, to, remain, during, the, 16th, century, thomas, more, s, book, utopia, proposed, an, ideal, society, of, the, same, name, readers, including, utopian, socialists, have, chosen, to, accept, this, imaginary, society, as, the, realistic, blueprint, for, a, working, nation, while, others, have, postulated, that, thomas, more, intended, nothing, of, the, sort, it, is, believed, that, more, s, utopia, functions, only, on, the, level, of, a, satire, a, work, intended, to, reveal, more, about, the, england, of, his, time, than, about, an, idealistic, society, this, interpretation, is, bolstered, by, the, title, of, the, book, and, nation, and, its, apparent, confusion, between, the, greek, for, no, place, and, good, place, utopia, is, a, compound, of, the, syllable, ou, meaning, no, and, topos, meaning, place, but, the, homophonic, prefix, eu, meaning, good, also, resonates, in, the, word, with, the, implication, that, the, perfectly, good, place, is, really, no, place, in, many, cultures, societies, and, religions, there, is, some, myth, or, memory, of, a, distant, past, when, humankind, lived, in, a, primitive, and, simple, state, but, at, the, same, time, one, of, perfect, happiness, and, fulfillment, in, those, days, the, various, myths, tell, us, there, was, an, instinctive, harmony, between, humanity, and, nature, people, s, needs, were, few, and, their, desires, limited, both, were, easily, satisfied, by, the, abundance, provided, by, nature, accordingly, there, were, no, motives, whatsoever, for, war, or, oppression, nor, was, there, any, need, for, hard, and, painful, work, humans, were, simple, and, pious, and, felt, themselves, close, to, their, god, or, gods, according, to, one, anthropological, theory, hunter, gatherers, were, the, original, affluent, society, these, mythical, or, religious, archetypes, are, inscribed, in, many, cultures, and, resurge, with, special, vitality, when, people, are, in, difficult, and, critical, times, however, in, utopias, the, projection, of, the, myth, does, not, take, place, towards, the, remote, past, but, either, towards, the, future, or, towards, distant, and, fictional, places, imagining, that, at, some, time, in, the, future, at, some, point, in, space, or, beyond, death, there, must, exist, the, possibility, of, living, happily, in, the, united, states, and, europe, during, the, second, great, awakening, ca, 1790, 1840, and, thereafter, many, radical, religious, groups, formed, utopian, societies, in, which, faith, could, govern, all, aspects, of, members, lives, these, utopian, societies, included, the, shakers, who, originated, in, england, in, the, 18th, century, and, arrived, in, america, in, 1774, a, number, of, religious, utopian, societies, from, europe, came, to, the, united, states, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, including, the, society, of, the, woman, in, the, wilderness, led, by, johannes, kelpius, 1667, 1708, the, ephrata, cloister, established, in, 1732, and, the, harmony, society, among, others, the, harmony, society, was, a, christian, theosophy, and, pietist, group, founded, in, iptingen, germany, in, 1785, due, to, religious, persecution, by, the, lutheran, church, and, the, government, in, w, rttemberg, the, society, moved, to, the, united, states, on, october, 7, 1803, settling, in, pennsylvania, on, february, 15, 1805, about, 400, followers, formally, organized, the, harmony, society, placing, all, their, goods, in, common, the, group, lasted, until, 1905, making, it, one, of, the, longest, running, financially, successful, communes, in, american, history, the, oneida, community, founded, by, john, humphrey, noyes, in, oneida, new, york, was, a, utopian, religious, commune, that, lasted, from, 1848, to, 1881, although, this, utopian, experiment, has, become, better, known, today, for, its, manufacture, of, oneida, silverware, it, was, one, of, the, longest, running, communes, in, american, history, the, amana, colonies, were, communal, settlements, in, iowa, started, by, radical, german, pietists, which, lasted, from, 1855, to, 1932, the, amana, corporation, manufacturer, of, refrigerators, and, household, appliances, was, originally, started, by, the, group, other, examples, are, fountain, grove, founded, in, 1875, riker, s, holy, city, and, other, californian, utopian, colonies, between, 1855, and, 1955, hine, as, well, as, sointula, in, british, columbia, canada, the, amish, and, hutterites, can, also, be, considered, an, attempt, towards, religious, utopia, a, wide, variety, of, intentional, communities, with, some, type, of, faith, based, ideas, have, also, started, across, the, world, anthropologist, richard, sosis, examined, 200, communes, in, the, 19th, century, united, states, both, religious, and, secular, mostly, utopian, socialist, 39, percent, of, the, religious, communes, were, still, functioning, 20, years, after, their, founding, while, only, 6, percent, of, the, secular, communes, were, the, number, of, costly, sacrifices, that, a, religious, commune, demanded, from, its, members, had, a, linear, effect, on, its, longevity, while, in, secular, communes, demands, for, costly, sacrifices, did, not, correlate, with, longevity, and, the, majority, of, the, secular, communes, failed, within, 8, years, sosis, cites, anthropologist, roy, rappaport, in, arguing, that, rituals, and, laws, are, more, effective, when, sacralized, social, psychologist, jonathan, haidt, cites, sosis, s, research, in, his, 2012, book, the, righteous, mind, as, the, best, evidence, that, religion, is, an, adaptive, solution, to, the, free, rider, problem, by, enabling, cooperation, without, kinship, evolutionary, medicine, researcher, randolph, m, nesse, and, theoretical, biologist, mary, jane, west, eberhard, have, argued, instead, that, because, humans, with, altruistic, tendencies, are, preferred, as, social, partners, they, receive, fitness, advantages, by, social, selection, with, nesse, arguing, further, that, social, selection, enabled, humans, as, a, species, to, become, extraordinarily, cooperative, and, capable, of, creating, culture, the, book, of, revelation, in, the, christian, bible, depicts, an, eschatological, time, with, the, defeat, of, satan, of, evil, and, of, sin, the, main, difference, compared, to, the, old, testament, promises, is, that, such, a, defeat, also, has, an, ontological, value, then, i, saw, a, new, heaven, and, a, new, earth, for, the, first, heaven, and, the, first, earth, had, passed, away, and, there, was, no, longer, any, sea, he, will, wipe, every, tear, from, their, eyes, there, will, be, no, more, death, or, mourning, or, crying, or, pain, for, the, old, order, of, things, has, passed, away, and, no, longer, just, gnosiological, isaiah, see, i, will, create, new, heavens, and, a, new, earth, the, former, things, will, not, be, remembered, nor, will, they, come, to, mind, narrow, interpretation, of, the, text, depicts, heaven, on, earth, or, a, heaven, brought, to, earth, without, sin, daily, and, mundane, details, of, this, new, earth, where, god, and, jesus, rule, remain, unclear, although, it, is, implied, to, be, similar, to, the, biblical, garden, of, eden, some, theological, philosophers, believe, that, heaven, will, not, be, a, physical, realm, but, instead, an, incorporeal, place, for, souls, the, greek, poet, hesiod, around, the, 8th, century, bc, in, his, compilation, of, the, mythological, tradition, the, poem, works, and, days, explained, that, prior, to, the, present, era, there, were, four, other, progressively, less, perfect, ones, the, oldest, of, which, was, the, golden, age, perhaps, the, oldest, utopia, of, which, we, know, as, pointed, out, many, years, ago, by, moses, finley, is, homer, s, scheria, island, of, the, phaeacians, a, mythical, place, often, equated, with, classical, corcyra, modern, corfu, kerkyra, where, odysseus, was, washed, ashore, after, 10, years, of, storm, tossed, wandering, and, escorted, to, the, king, s, palace, by, his, daughter, nausicaa, with, stout, walls, a, stone, temple, and, good, harbours, it, is, perhaps, the, ideal,

version, of, 1611, and, the, lord, god, planted, a, garden, eastward, in, eden, and, there, he, put, the, man, whom, he, had, formed, out, of, the, ground, made, the, lord, god, to, grow, every, tree, that, is, pleasant, to, the, sight, and, good, for, food, the, tree, of, life, also, in, the, midst, of, the, garden, and, the, tree, of, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, and, the, lord, god, took, the, man, and, put, him, into, the, garden, of, eden, to, dress, it, and, to, keep, it, and, the, lord, god, commanded, the, man, saying, of, every, tree, of, the, garden, thou, mayest, freely, eat, but, of, the, tree, of, the, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, thou, shalt, not, eat, of, it, for, in, the, day, that, thou, eatest, thereof, thou, shalt, surely, die, and, the, lord, god, said, it, is, not, good, that, the, man, should, be, alone, and, the, lord, god, caused, a, deep, sleep, to, fall, upon, adam, and, he, slept, and, he, took, one, of, his, ribs, and, closed, up, the, flesh, instead, thereof, and, the, rib, which, the, lord, god, had, taken, from, man, made, he, a, woman, and, brought, her, unto, the, man, according, to, the, exegesis, that, the, biblical, theologian, herbert, haag, proposes, in, the, book, is, original, sin, in, scripture, published, soon, after, the, second, vatican, council, genesis, 2, 25, would, indicate, that, adam, and, eve, were, created, from, the, beginning, naked, of, the, divine, grace, an, originary, grace, that, then, they, would, never, have, had, and, even, less, would, have, lost, due, to, the, subsequent, events, narrated, on, the, other, hand, while, supporting, a, continuity, in, the, bible, about, the, absence, of, preternatural, gifts, latin, dona, praeternaturalia, with, regard, to, the, ophitic, event, haag, never, makes, any, reference, to, the, discontinuity, of, the, loss, of, access, to, the, tree, of, life, the, land, of, cockaigne, also, cockaygne, cokaygne, was, an, imaginary, land, of, idleness, and, luxury, famous, in, medieval, stories, and, the, subject, of, several, poems, one, of, which, an, early, translation, of, a, 13th, century, french, work, is, given, in, george, ellis, specimens,

of, affairs, they, describe, is, not, irretrievably, and, irrevocably, lost, to, mankind, that, it, can, be, regained, in, some, way, or, other, one, way, might, be, a, quest, for, an, earthly, paradise, a, place, like, shangri, la, hidden, in, the, tibetan, mountains, and, described, by, james, hilton, in, his, utopian, novel, lost, horizon, 1933, christopher, columbus, followed, directly, in, this, tradition, in, his, belief, that, he, had, found, the, garden, of, eden, when, towards, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, he, first, encountered, the, new, world, and, its, indigenous,

fisherman, from, wuling, sailed, upstream, a, river, and, came, across, a, beautiful, blossoming, peach, grove, and, lush, green, fields, covered, with, blossom, petals, entranced, by, the, beauty, he, continued, upstream, and, stumbled, onto, a, small, grotto, when, he, reached, the, end, of, the, river, though, narrow, at, first, he, was, able, to, squeeze, through, the, passage, and, discovered, an, ethereal, utopia, where, the, people, led, an, ideal, existence, in, harmony, with, nature, he, saw, a, vast, expanse, of, fertile, lands, clear, ponds, mulberry, trees, bamboo, groves, and, the, like, with, a, community, of, people, of, all, ages, and, houses, in, neat, rows, the, people, explained, that, their, ancestors, escaped, to, this, place, during, the, civil, unrest, of, the, qin, dynasty, and, they, themselves, had, not, left, since, or, had, contact, with, anyone, from, the, outside, they, had, not, even, heard, of, the, later, dynasties, of, bygone, times, or, the, then, current, jin, dynasty, in, the, story, the, community, was, secluded, and, unaffected, by, the, troubles, of, the, outside, world, the, sense, of, timelessness, was, predominant, in, the, story, as, a, perfect, utopian, community, remains, unchanged, that, is, it, had, no, decline, nor, the, need, to, improve, eventually, the, chinese, term, peach, blossom, spring, came, to, be, synonymous, for, the, concept, of, utopia, datong, chinese, pinyin, d, t, ng, is, a, traditional, chinese, utopia, the, main, description, of, it, is, found, in, the, chinese, classic, of, rites,

the, early, 19th, century, several, utopian, ideas, arose, often, in, response, to, the, belief, that, social, disruption, was, created, and, caused, by, the, development, of, commercialism, and, capitalism, these, ideas, are, often, grouped, in, a, greater, utopian, socialist, movement, due, to, their, shared, characteristics, a, once, common, characteristic, is, an, egalitarian, distribution, of, goods, frequently, with, the, total, abolition, of, money, citizens, only, do, work, which, they, enjoy, and, which, is, for, the, common, good, leaving, them, with, ample, time, for, the, cultivation, of, the, arts, and, sciences, one, classic, example, of, such, a, utopia, appears, in, edward, bellamy, s, 1888, novel, looking, backward, william, morris, depicts, another, socialist, utopia, in, his, 1890, novel, news, from, nowhere, written, partially, in, response, to, the, top, down, bureaucratic, nature, of, bellamy, s, utopia, which, morris, criticized, however,

pennsylvania, founded, in, 1681, and, georgia, founded, in, 1733, were, the, only, three, english, colonies, in, america, that, were, planned, as, utopian, societies, with, an, integrated, physical, economic, and, social, design, at, the, heart, of, the, plan, for, georgia, was, a, concept, of, agrarian, equality, in, which, land, was, allocated, equally, and, additional, land, acquisition, through, purchase, or, inheritance, was, prohibited, the, plan, was, an, early, step, toward, the, yeoman, republic, later, envisioned, by, thomas, jefferson, the, communes, of, the, 1960s, in, the, united, states, often, represented, an, attempt, to, greatly, improve, the, way, humans, live, together, in, communities, the, back, to, the, land, movements, and, hippies, inspired, many, to, try, to, live, in, peace, and, harmony, on, farms, or, in, remote, areas, and, to, set, up, new, types, of, governance, communes, like, kaliflower, which, existed, between, 1967, and, 1973, attempted, to, live, outside, of, society, s, norms, and, to, create, their, own, ideal, communalist, society, people, all, over, the, world, organized, and, built, intentional, communities, with, the, hope, of, developing, a, better, way, of, living, together, many, of, these, intentional, communities, are, relatively, small, many, intentional, communities, have, a, population, close, to, 100, with, many, possibly, exceeding, this, number, while, this, may, seem, large, it, is, pretty, small, in, comparison, to, the, rest, of, society, from, the, small, populations, it, is, apparent, that, people, do, not, prefer, this, kind, of, living, while, many, of, these, new, small, communities, failed, some, continue, to, grow, such, as, the, religion, based, twelve, tribes, which, started, in, the, united, states, in, 1972, since, its, inception, it, has, grown, into, many, groups, around, the, world, similarly, a, commune, called, brook, farm, established, itself, in, 1841, founded, by, charles, fourier, s, visions, of, utopia, they, attempted, to, recreate, his, idea, of, a, central, building, in, society, called, the, phalanx, unfortunately, this, commune, could, not, sustain, itself, and, failed, after, only, six, years, of, operation, they, wanted, to, stay, open, for, longer, but, they, could, not, afford, it, their, goal, however, was, very, similar, to, that, of, utopia, to, lead, a, more, wholesome, and, simpler, life, than, the, atmosphere, of, pressure, surrounding, society, at, the, time, it, is, clear, that, despite, ambition, it, is, difficult, for, communes, to, stay, in, operation, for, very, long, though, francis, bacon, s, new, atlantis, is, imbued, with, a, scientific, spirit, scientific, and, technological, utopias, tend, to, be, based, in, the, future, when, it, is, believed, that, advanced, science, and, technology, will, allow, utopian, living, standards, for, example, the, absence, of, death, and, suffering, changes, in, human, nature, and, the, human, condition, technology, has, affected, the, way, humans, have, lived, to, such, an, extent, that, normal, functions, like, sleep, eating, or, even, reproduction, have, been, replaced, by, artificial, means, other, examples, include, a, society, where, humans, have, struck, a, balance, with, technology, and, it, is, merely, used, to, enhance, the, human, living, condition, e, g, star, trek, in, place, of, the, static, perfection, of, a, utopia, libertarian, transhumanists, envision, an, extropia, an, open, evolving, society, allowing, individuals, and, voluntary, groupings, to, form, the, institutions, and, social, forms, they, prefer, mariah, utsawa, presented, a, theoretical, basis, for, technological, utopianism, and, set, out, to, develop, a, variety, of, technologies, ranging, from, maps, to, designs, for, cars, and, houses, which, might, lead, to, the, development, of, such, a, utopia, in, his, book, deep, utopia, life, and, meaning, in, a, solved, world, philosopher, nick, bostrom, explores, what, to, do, in, a, solved, world, assuming, that, human, civilization, safely, builds, machine, superintelligence, and, manages, to, solve, its, political, coordination, and, fairness, problems, he, outlines, some, technologies, considered, physically, possible, at, technological, maturity, such, as, cognitive, enhancement, reversal, of, aging, self, replicating, spacecrafts, arbitrary, sensory, inputs, taste, sound, or, the, precise, control, of, motivation, mood, well, being, and, personality, one, notable, example, of, a, technological, and, libertarian, socialist, utopia, is, scottish, author, iain, banks, culture, opposing, this, optimistic, perspective, are, scenarios, where, advanced, science, and, technology, will, through, deliberate, misuse, or, accident, cause, environmental, damage, or, even, humanity, s, extinction, critics, such, as, jacques, ellul, and, timothy, mitchell, advocate, precautions, against, the, premature, embrace, of, new, technologies, both, raise, questions, about, changing, responsibility, and, freedom, brought, by, division, of, labour, authors, such, as, john, zerzan, and, derrick, jensen, consider, that, modern, technology, is, progressively, depriving, humans, of, their, autonomy, and, advocate, the, collapse, of, the, industrial, civilization, in, favor, of, small, scale, organization, as, a, necessary, path, to, avoid, the, threat, of, technology, on, human, freedom, and, sustainability, there, are, many, examples, of, techno, dystopias, portrayed, in, mainstream, culture, such, as, the, classics, brave, new, world, and, nineteen, eighty, four, often, published, as, 1984, which, have, explored, some, of, these, topics, ecological, utopian, society, describes, new, ways, in, which,

some, mix, of, the, two, socialist, and, economic, utopias, have, tended, to, take, the, woman, question, seriously, and, often, to, offer, some, form, of, equality, between, the, sexes, as, part, and, parcel, of, their, vision, whether, this, be, by, addressing, misogyny, reorganizing, society, along, separatist, lines, creating, a, certain, kind, of, androgynous, equality, that, ignores, gender, or, in, some, other, manner, for, example, edward, bellamy, s, looking, backward, 1887, responded, progressively, for, his, day, to, the, contemporary, women, s, suffrage, and, women, s, rights, movements, bellamy, supported, these, movements, by, incorporating, the, equality, of, women, and, men, into, his, utopian, world, s, structure, albeit, by, consigning, women, to, a, separate, sphere, of, light, industrial, activity, due, to, women, s, lesser, physical, strength, and, making, various, exceptions, for, them, in, order, to, make, room, for, and, to, praise, motherhood, one,
