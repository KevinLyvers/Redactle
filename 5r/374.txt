aphrodite, f, r, d, a, t, i, af, r, dy, tee, is, an, ancient, greek, goddess, associated, with, love, lust, beauty, pleasure, passion, procreation, and, as, her, syncretized, roman, goddess, counterpart, venus, desire, sex, fertility, prosperity, and, victory, aphrodite, s, major, symbols, include, seashells, myrtles, roses, doves, sparrows, and, swans, the, cult, of, aphrodite, was, largely, derived, from, that, of, the, phoenician, goddess, astarte, a, cognate, of, the, east, semitic, goddess, ishtar, whose, cult, was, based, on, the, sumerian, cult, of, inanna, aphrodite, s, main, cult, centers, were, cythera, cyprus, corinth, and, athens, her, main, festival, was, the, aphrodisia, which, was, celebrated, annually, in, midsummer, in, laconia, aphrodite, was, worshipped, as, a, warrior, goddess, she, was, also, the, patron, goddess, of, prostitutes, an, association, which, led, early, scholars, to, propose, the, concept, of, sacred, prostitution, in, greco, roman, culture, an, idea, which, is, now, generally, seen, as, erroneous, in, hesiod, s, theogony, aphrodite, is, born, off, the, coast, of, cythera, from, the, foam, aphr, s, produced, by, uranus, s, genitals, which, his, son, cronus, had, severed, and, thrown, into, the, sea, in, homer, s, iliad, however, she, is, the, daughter, of, zeus, and, dione, plato, in, his, symposium, asserts, that, these, two, origins, actually, belong, to, separate, entities, aphrodite, urania, a, transcendent, heavenly, aphrodite, and, aphrodite, pandemos, aphrodite, common, to, all, the, people, aphrodite, had, many, other, epithets, each, emphasizing, a, different, aspect, of, the, same, goddess, or, used, by, a, different, local, cult, thus, she, was, also, known, as, cytherea, lady, of, cythera, and, cypris, lady, of, cyprus, because, both, locations, claimed, to, be, the, place, of, her, birth, in, greek, mythology, aphrodite, was, married, to, hephaestus, the, god, of, fire, blacksmiths, and, metalworking, aphrodite, was, frequently, unfaithful, to, him, and, had, many, lovers, in, the, odyssey, she, is, caught, in, the, act, of, adultery, with, ares, the, god, of, war, in, the, first, homeric, hymn, to, aphrodite, she, seduces, the, mortal, shepherd, anchises, aphrodite, was, also, the, surrogate, mother, and, lover, of, the, mortal, shepherd, adonis, who, was, killed, by, a, wild, boar, along, with, athena, and, hera, aphrodite, was, one, of, the, three, goddesses, whose, feud, resulted, in, the, beginning, of, the, trojan, war, and, she, plays, a, major, role, throughout, the, iliad, aphrodite, has, been, featured, in, western, art, as, a, symbol, of, female, beauty, and, has, appeared, in, numerous, works, of, western, literature, she, is, a, major, deity, in, modern, neopagan, religions, including, the, church, of, aphrodite, wicca, and, hellenismos, hesiod, derives, aphrodite, from, aphr, s, sea, foam, interpreting, the, name, as, risen, from, the, foam, but, most, modern, scholars, regard, this, as, a, spurious, folk, etymology, early, modern, scholars, of, classical, mythology, attempted, to, argue, that, aphrodite, s, name, was, of, greek, or, indo, european, origin, but, these, efforts, have, now, been, mostly, abandoned, aphrodite, s, name, is, generally, accepted, to, be, of, non, greek, probably, semitic, origin, but, its, exact, derivation, cannot, be, determined, with, confidence, scholars, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, accepting, hesiod, s, foam, etymology, as, genuine, analyzed, the, second, part, of, aphrodite, s, name, as, od, t, wanderer, or, d, t, bright, more, recently, michael, janda, also, accepting, hesiod, s, etymology, has, argued, in, favor, of, the, latter, of, these, interpretations, and, claims, the, story, of, a, birth, from, the, foam, as, an, indo, european, mytheme, similarly, krzysztof, tomasz, witczak, proposes, an, indo, european, compound, ab, or, very, and, d, ei, to, shine, also, referring, to, eos, and, daniel, k, lligan, has, interpreted, her, name, as, shining, up, from, the, mist, foam, other, scholars, have, argued, that, these, hypotheses, are, unlikely, since, aphrodite, s, attributes, are, entirely, different, from, those, of, both, eos, and, the, vedic, deity, ushas, modern, scholars, due, to, the, believed, near, eastern, origins, of, aphrodite, s, worship, have, since, proposed, semitic, origins, for, the, name, some, scholars, such, as, fritz, hommel, have, suggested, that, aphrodite, s, name, is, a, hellenized, pronunciation, of, the, name, astarte, other, scholars, however, reject, this, as, being, linguistically, untenable, martin, west, reconstructs, a, cyprian, canaanite, form, of, the, name, as, either, aprod, t, or, apro, t, and, cautiously, suggests, the, latter, as, being, an, epithet, with, the, meaning, she, of, the, villages, aren, wilson, wright, suggests, the, phoenician, form, aprod, t, as, an, elative, epithet, meaning, unique, excellent, sublime, a, number, of, improbable, non, greek, etymologies, have, also, been, suggested, one, semitic, etymology, compares, aphrodite, to, the, assyrian, bar, r, tu, the, name, of, a, female, demon, that, appears, in, middle, babylonian, and, late, babylonian, texts, hammarstr, m, looks, to, etruscan, comparing, e, pr, ni, lord, an, etruscan, honorific, loaned, into, greek, as, this, would, make, the, theonym, in, origin, an, honorific, the, lady, most, scholars, reject, this, etymology, as, implausible, especially, since, aphrodite, actually, appears, in, etruscan, in, the, borrowed, form, apru, from, greek, aphr, clipped, form, of, aphrodite, the, medieval, etymologicum, magnum, c, 1150, offers, a, highly, contrived, etymology, deriving, aphrodite, from, the, compound, habrod, aitos, she, who, lives, delicately, from, habr, s, and, d, aita, the, alteration, from, b, to, ph, is, explained, as, a, familiar, characteristic, of, greek, obvious, from, the, macedonians, in, the, cypriot, syllabary, a, syllabic, script, used, on, the, island, of, cyprus, from, the, eleventh, until, the, fourth, century, bc, her, name, is, attested, in, the, forms, a, po, ro, ta, o, i, read, right, to, left, a, po, ro, ti, ta, i, samewise, and, finally, a, po, ro, ti, si, jo, aphrodisian, related, to, aphrodite, in, the, context, of, a, month, the, cult, of, aphrodite, in, greece, was, imported, from, or, at, least, influenced, by, the, cult, of, astarte, in, phoenicia, which, in, turn, was, influenced, by, the, cult, of, the, mesopotamian, goddess, known, as, ishtar, to, the, east, semitic, peoples, and, as, inanna, to, the, sumerians, pausanias, states, that, the, first, to, establish, a, cult, of, aphrodite, were, the, assyrians, followed, by, the, paphians, of, cyprus, and, then, the, phoenicians, at, ascalon, the, phoenicians, in, turn, taught, her, worship, to, the, people, of, cythera, aphrodite, took, on, inanna, ishtar, s, associations, with, sexuality, and, procreation, furthermore, she, was, known, as, ourania, which, means, heavenly, a, title, corresponding, to, inanna, s, role, as, the, queen, of, heaven, early, artistic, and, literary, portrayals, of, aphrodite, are, extremely, similar, on, inanna, ishtar, like, inanna, ishtar, aphrodite, was, also, a, warrior, goddess, the, second, century, ad, greek, geographer, pausanias, records, that, in, sparta, aphrodite, was, worshipped, as, aphrodite, areia, which, means, warlike, he, also, mentions, that, aphrodite, s, most, ancient, cult, statues, in, sparta, and, on, cythera, showed, her, bearing, arms, modern, scholars, note, that, aphrodite, s, warrior, goddess, aspects, appear, in, the, oldest, strata, of, her, worship, and, see, it, as, an, indication, of, her, near, eastern, origins, nineteenth, century, classical, scholars, had, a, general, aversion, to, the, idea, that, ancient, greek, religion, was, at, all, influenced, by, the, cultures, of, the, near, east, but, even, friedrich, gottlieb, welcker, who, argued, that, near, eastern, influence, on, greek, culture, was, largely, confined, to, material, culture, admitted, that, aphrodite, was, clearly, of, phoenician, origin, the, significant, influence, of, near, eastern, culture, on, early, greek, religion, in, general, and, on, the, cult, of, aphrodite, in, particular, is, now, widely, recognized, as, dating, to, a, period, of, orientalization, during, the, eighth, century, bc, when, archaic, greece, was, on, the, fringes, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, some, early, comparative, mythologists, opposed, to, the, idea, of, a, near, eastern, origin, argued, that, aphrodite, originated, as, an, aspect, of, the, greek, dawn, goddess, eos, and, that, she, was, therefore, ultimately, derived, from, the, proto, indo, european, dawn, goddess, h, a, us, s, properly, greek, eos, latin, aurora, sanskrit, ushas, most, modern, scholars, have, now, rejected, the, notion, of, a, purely, indo, european, aphrodite, but, it, is, possible, that, aphrodite, originally, a, semitic, deity, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, indo, european, dawn, goddess, both, aphrodite, and, eos, were, known, for, their, erotic, beauty, and, aggressive, sexuality, and, both, had, relationships, with, mortal, lovers, both, goddesses, were, associated, with, the, colors, red, white, and, gold, michael, janda, etymologizes, aphrodite, s, name, as, an, epithet, of, eos, meaning, she, who, rises, from, the, foam, and, points, to, hesiod, s, theogony, account, of, aphrodite, s, birth, as, an, archaic, reflex, of, indo, european, myth, aphrodite, rising, out, of, the, waters, after, cronus, defeats, uranus, as, a, mytheme, would, then, be, directly, cognate, to, the, rigvedic, myth, of, indra, defeating, vrtra, liberating, ushas, another, key, similarity, between, aphrodite, and, the, indo, european, dawn, goddess, is, her, close, kinship, to, the, greek, sky, deity, since, both, of, the, main, claimants, to, her, paternity, zeus, and, uranus, are, sky, deities, aphrodite, s, most, common, cultic, epithet, was, ourania, meaning, heavenly, but, this, epithet, almost, never, occurs, in, literary, texts, indicating, a, purely, cultic, significance, another, common, name, for, aphrodite, was, pandemos, for, all, the, folk, in, her, role, as, aphrodite, pandemos, aphrodite, was, associated, with, peith, meaning, persuasion, and, could, be, prayed, to, for, aid, in, seduction, the, character, of, pausanias, in, plato, s, symposium, takes, differing, cult, practices, associated, with, different, epithets, of, the, goddess, to, claim, that, ourania, and, pandemos, are, in, fact, separate, goddesses, he, asserts, that, aphrodite, ourania, is, the, celestial, aphrodite, born, from, the, sea, foam, after, cronus, castrated, uranus, and, the, older, of, the, two, goddesses, according, to, the, symposium, aphrodite, ourania, is, the, inspiration, of, male, homosexual, desire, specifically, the, ephebic, eros, and, pederasty, aphrodite, pandemos, by, contrast, is, the, younger, of, the, two, goddesses, the, common, aphrodite, born, from, the, union, of, zeus, and, dione, and, the, inspiration, of, heterosexual, desire, and, sexual, promiscuity, the, lesser, of, the, two, loves, paphian, was, one, of, her, epithets, after, the, paphos, in, cyprus, where, she, had, emerged, from, the, sea, at, her, birth, among, the, neoplatonists, and, later, their, christian, interpreters, ourania, is, associated, with, spiritual, love, and, pandemos, with, physical, love, desire, a, representation, of, ourania, with, her, foot, resting, on, a, tortoise, came, to, be, seen, as, emblematic, of, discretion, in, conjugal, love, it, was, the, subject, of, a, chryselephantine, sculpture, by, phidias, for, elis, known, only, from, a, parenthetical, comment, by, the, geographer, pausanias, one, of, aphrodite, s, most, common, literary, epithets, is, philommeid, s, which, means, smile, loving, but, is, sometimes, mistranslated, as, laughter, loving, this, epithet, occurs, throughout, both, of, the, homeric, epics, and, the, first, homeric, hymn, to, aphrodite, hesiod, references, it, once, in, his, theogony, in, the, context, of, aphrodite, s, birth, but, interprets, it, as, genital, loving, rather, than, smile, loving, monica, cyrino, notes, that, the, epithet, may, relate, to, the, fact, that, in, many, artistic, depictions, of, aphrodite, she, is, shown, smiling, other, common, literary, epithets, are, cypris, and, cythereia, which, derive, from, her, associations, with, the, islands, of, cyprus, and, cythera, respectively, on, cyprus, aphrodite, was, sometimes, called, eleemon, the, merciful, in, athens, she, was, known, as, aphrodite, en, kopois, aphrodite, of, the, gardens, at, cape, colias, a, town, along, the, attic, coast, she, was, venerated, as, genetyllis, mother, the, spartans, worshipped, her, as, potnia, mistress, enoplios, armed, morpho, shapely, ambologera, she, who, postpones, old, age, across, the, greek, world, she, was, known, under, epithets, such, as, melainis, black, one, skotia, dark, one, androphonos, killer, of, men, anosia, unholy, and, tymborychos, gravedigger, all, of, which, indicate, her, darker, more, violent, nature, she, had, the, epithet, automata, because, according, to, servius, she, was, the, source, of, spontaneous, love, a, male, version, of, aphrodite, known, as, aphroditus, was, worshipped, in, the, city, of, amathus, on, cyprus, aphroditus, was, depicted, with, the, figure, and, dress, of, a, woman, but, had, a, beard, and, was, shown, lifting, his, dress, to, reveal, an, erect, phallus, this, gesture, was, believed, to, be, an, apotropaic, symbol, and, was, thought, to, convey, good, fortune, upon, the, viewer, eventually, the, popularity, of, aphroditus, waned, as, the, mainstream, fully, feminine, version, of, aphrodite, became, more, popular, but, traces, of, his, cult, are, preserved, in, the, later, legends, of, hermaphroditus, aphrodite, s, main, festival, the, aphrodisia, was, celebrated, across, greece, but, particularly, in, athens, and, corinth, in, athens, the, aphrodisia, was, celebrated, on, the, fourth, day, of, the, month, of, hekatombaion, in, honor, of, aphrodite, s, role, in, the, unification, of, attica, during, this, festival, the, priests, of, aphrodite, would, purify, the, temple, of, aphrodite, pandemos, on, the, southwestern, slope, of, the, acropolis, with, the, blood, of, a, sacrificed, dove, next, the, altars, would, be, anointed, and, the, cult, statues, of, aphrodite, pandemos, and, peitho, would, be, escorted, in, a, majestic, procession, to, a, place, where, they, would, be, ritually, bathed, aphrodite, was, also, honored, in, athens, as, part, of, the, arrhephoria, festival, the, fourth, day, of, every, month, was, sacred, to, aphrodite, pausanias, records, that, in, sparta, aphrodite, was, worshipped, as, aphrodite, areia, which, means, warlike, this, epithet, stresses, aphrodite, s, connections, to, ares, with, whom, she, had, extramarital, relations, pausanias, also, records, that, in, sparta, and, on, cythera, a, number, of, extremely, ancient, cult, statues, of, aphrodite, portrayed, her, bearing, arms, other, cult, statues, showed, her, bound, in, chains, aphrodite, was, the, patron, goddess, of, prostitutes, of, all, varieties, ranging, from, pornai, cheap, street, prostitutes, typically, owned, as, slaves, by, wealthy, pimps, to, hetairai, expensive, well, educated, hired, companions, who, were, usually, self, employed, and, sometimes, provided, sex, to, their, customers, the, city, of, corinth, was, renowned, throughout, the, ancient, world, for, its, many, hetairai, who, had, a, widespread, reputation, for, being, among, the, most, skilled, but, also, the, most, expensive, prostitutes, in, the, greek, world, corinth, also, had, a, major, temple, to, aphrodite, located, on, the, acrocorinth, and, was, one, of, the, main, centers, of, her, cult, records, of, numerous, dedications, to, aphrodite, made, by, successful, courtesans, have, survived, in, poems, and, in, pottery, inscriptions, references, to, aphrodite, in, association, with, prostitution, are, found, in, corinth, as, well, as, on, the, islands, of, cyprus, cythera, and, sicily, aphrodite, s, mesopotamian, precursor, inanna, ishtar, was, also, closely, associated, with, prostitution, scholars, in, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, believed, that, the, cult, of, aphrodite, may, have, involved, ritual, prostitution, an, assumption, based, on, ambiguous, passages, in, certain, ancient, texts, particularly, a, fragment, of, a, skolion, by, the, boeotian, poet, pindar, which, mentions, prostitutes, in, corinth, in, association, with, aphrodite, modern, scholars, now, dismiss, the, notion, of, ritual, prostitution, in, greece, as, a, historiographic, myth, with, no, factual, basis, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, greeks, identified, aphrodite, with, the, ancient, egyptian, goddesses, hathor, and, isis, aphrodite, was, the, patron, goddess, of, the, lagid, queens, and, queen, arsinoe, ii, was, identified, as, her, mortal, incarnation, aphrodite, was, worshipped, in, alexandria, and, had, numerous, temples, in, and, around, the, city, arsinoe, ii, introduced, the, cult, of, adonis, to, alexandria, and, many, of, the, women, there, partook, in, it, the, tessarakonteres, a, gigantic, catamaran, galley, designed, by, archimedes, for, ptolemy, iv, philopator, had, a, circular, temple, to, aphrodite, on, it, with, a, marble, statue, of, the, goddess, herself, in, the, second, century, bc, ptolemy, viii, physcon, and, his, wives, cleopatra, ii, and, cleopatra, iii, dedicated, a, temple, to, aphrodite, hathor, at, philae, statuettes, of, aphrodite, for, personal, devotion, became, common, in, egypt, starting, in, the, early, ptolemaic, times, and, extending, until, long, after, egypt, became, a, roman, province, the, ancient, romans, identified, aphrodite, with, their, goddess, venus, who, was, originally, a, goddess, of, agricultural, fertility, vegetation, and, springtime, according, to, the, roman, historian, livy, aphrodite, and, venus, were, officially, identified, in, the, third, century, bc, when, the, cult, of, venus, erycina, was, introduced, to, rome, from, the, greek, sanctuary, of, aphrodite, on, mount, eryx, in, sicily, after, this, point, romans, adopted, aphrodite, s, iconography, and, myths, and, applied, them, to, venus, because, aphrodite, was, the, mother, of, the, trojan, hero, aeneas, in, greek, mythology, and, roman, tradition, claimed, aeneas, as, the, founder, of, rome, venus, became, venerated, as, venus, genetrix, the, mother, of, the, entire, roman, nation, julius, caesar, claimed, to, be, directly, descended, from, aeneas, s, son, iulus, and, became, a, strong, proponent, of, the, cult, of, venus, this, precedent, was, later, followed, by, his, nephew, augustus, and, the, later, emperors, claiming, succession, from, him, this, syncretism, greatly, impacted, greek, worship, of, aphrodite, during, the, roman, era, the, cults, of, aphrodite, in, many, greek, cities, began, to, emphasize, her, relationship, with, troy, and, aeneas, they, also, began, to, adopt, distinctively, roman, elements, portraying, aphrodite, as, more, maternal, more, militaristic, and, more, concerned, with, administrative, bureaucracy, she, was, claimed, as, a, divine, guardian, by, many, political, magistrates, appearances, of, aphrodite, in, greek, literature, also, vastly, proliferated, usually, showing, aphrodite, in, a, characteristically, roman, manner, aphrodite, is, usually, said, to, have, been, born, near, her, chief, center, of, worship, paphos, on, the, island, of, cyprus, which, is, why, she, is, sometimes, called, cyprian, especially, in, the, poetic, works, of, sappho, the, sanctuary, of, aphrodite, paphia, marking, her, birthplace, was, a, place, of, pilgrimage, in, the, ancient, world, for, centuries, other, versions, of, her, myth, have, her, born, near, the, island, of, cythera, hence, another, of, her, names, cytherea, cythera, was, a, stopping, place, for, trade, and, culture, between, crete, and, the, peloponesus, so, these, stories, may, preserve, traces, of, the, migration, of, aphrodite, s, cult, from, the, middle, east, to, mainland, greece, according, to, the, version, of, her, birth, recounted, by, hesiod, in, his, theogony, cronus, severed, uranus, genitals, and, threw, them, behind, him, into, the, sea, the, foam, from, his, genitals, gave, rise, to, aphrodite, hence, her, name, which, hesiod, interprets, as, foam, arisen, while, the, giants, the, erinyes, furies, and, the, meliae, emerged, from, the, drops, of, his, blood, hesiod, states, that, the, genitals, were, carried, over, the, sea, a, long, time, and, white, foam, arose, from, the, immortal, flesh, with, it, a, girl, grew, after, aphrodite, was, born, from, the, sea, foam, she, washed, up, to, shore, in, the, presence, of, the, other, gods, hesiod, s, account, of, aphrodite, s, birth, following, uranus, s, castration, is, probably, derived, from, the, song, of, kumarbi, an, ancient, hittite, epic, poem, in, which, the, god, kumarbi, overthrows, his, father, anu, the, god, of, the, sky, and, bites, off, his, genitals, causing, him, to, become, pregnant, and, give, birth, to, anu, s, children, which, include, ishtar, and, her, brother, teshub, the, hittite, storm, god, in, the, iliad, aphrodite, is, described, as, the, daughter, of, zeus, and, dione, dione, s, name, appears, to, be, a, feminine, cognate, to, dios, and, dion, which, are, oblique, forms, of, the, name, zeus, zeus, and, dione, shared, a, cult, at, dodona, in, northwestern, greece, in, the, theogony, hesiod, describes, dione, as, an, oceanid, but, apollodorus, makes, her, the, thirteenth, titan, child, of, gaia, and, uranus, aphrodite, is, consistently, portrayed, as, a, nubile, infinitely, desirable, adult, having, had, no, childhood, she, is, often, depicted, nude, in, the, iliad, aphrodite, is, the, apparently, unmarried, consort, of, ares, the, god, of, war, and, the, wife, of, hephaestus, is, a, different, goddess, named, charis, likewise, in, hesiod, s, theogony, aphrodite, is, unmarried, and, the, wife, of, hephaestus, is, aglaea, the, youngest, of, the, three, charites, in, book, eight, of, the, odyssey, however, the, blind, singer, demodocus, describes, aphrodite, as, the, wife, of, hephaestus, and, tells, how, she, committed, adultery, with, ares, during, the, trojan, war, the, sun, god, helios, saw, aphrodite, and, ares, having, sex, in, hephaestus, s, bed, and, warned, hephaestus, who, fashioned, a, fine, near, invisible, net, the, next, time, ares, and, aphrodite, had, sex, together, the, net, trapped, them, both, hephaestus, brought, all, the, gods, into, the, bedchamber, to, laugh, at, the, captured, adulterers, but, apollo, hermes, and, poseidon, had, sympathy, for, ares, and, poseidon, agreed, to, pay, hephaestus, for, ares, s, release, aphrodite, returned, to, her, temple, in, cyprus, where, she, was, attended, by, the, charites, this, narrative, probably, originated, as, a, greek, folk, tale, originally, independent, of, the, odyssey, in, a, much, later, interpolated, detail, ares, put, the, young, soldier, alectryon, by, the, door, to, warn, of, helios, s, arrival, but, alectryon, fell, asleep, on, guard, duty, helios, discovered, the, two, and, alerted, hephaestus, ares, in, rage, turned, alectryon, into, a, rooster, which, unfailingly, crows, to, announce, the, sunrise, after, exposing, them, hephaestus, asks, zeus, for, his, wedding, gifts, and, dowry, to, be, returned, to, him, by, the, time, of, the, trojan, war, he, is, married, to, charis, aglaea, one, of, the, graces, apparently, divorced, from, aphrodite, afterwards, it, was, generally, ares, who, was, regarded, as, the, husband, or, official, consort, of, the, goddess, on, the, fran, ois, vase, the, two, arrive, at, the, wedding, of, peleus, and, thetis, on, the, same, chariot, as, do, zeus, with, hera, and, poseidon, with, amphitrite, the, poets, pindar, and, aeschylus, refer, to, ares, as, aphrodite, s, husband, later, stories, were, invented, to, explain, aphrodite, s, marriage, to, hephaestus, in, the, most, famous, story, zeus, hastily, married, aphrodite, to, hephaestus, in, order, to, prevent, the, other, gods, from, fighting, over, her, in, another, version, of, the, myth, hephaestus, gave, his, mother, hera, a, golden, throne, but, when, she, sat, on, it, she, became, trapped, and, he, refused, to, let, her, go, until, she, agreed, to, give, him, aphrodite, s, hand, in, marriage, hephaestus, was, overjoyed, to, be, married, to, the, goddess, of, beauty, and, forged, her, beautiful, jewelry, including, a, strophion, known, as, the, kestos, himas, a, saltire, shaped, undergarment, usually, translated, as, the, girdle, of, aphrodite, which, accentuated, her, breasts, and, made, her, even, more, irresistible, to, men, such, strophia, were, commonly, used, in, depictions, of, the, near, eastern, goddesses, ishtar, and, atargatis, aphrodite, is, almost, always, accompanied, by, eros, the, god, of, lust, and, sexual, desire, in, his, theogony, hesiod, describes, eros, as, one, of, the, four, original, primeval, forces, born, at, the, beginning, of, time, but, after, the, birth, of, aphrodite, from, the, sea, foam, he, is, joined, by, himeros, and, together, they, become, aphrodite, s, constant, companions, in, early, greek, art, eros, and, himeros, are, both, shown, as, idealized, handsome, youths, with, wings, the, greek, lyric, poets, regarded, the, power, of, eros, and, himeros, as, dangerous, compulsive, and, impossible, for, anyone, to, resist, in, modern, times, eros, is, often, seen, as, aphrodite, s, son, but, this, is, actually, a, comparatively, late, innovation, a, scholion, on, theocritus, s, idylls, remarks, that, the, sixth, century, bc, poet, sappho, had, described, eros, as, the, son, of, aphrodite, and, uranus, but, the, first, surviving, reference, to, eros, as, aphrodite, s, son, comes, from, apollonius, of, rhodes, s, argonautica, written, in, the, third, century, bc, which, makes, him, the, son, of, aphrodite, and, ares, later, the, romans, who, saw, venus, as, a, mother, goddess, seized, on, this, idea, of, eros, as, aphrodite, s, son, and, popularized, it, making, it, the, predominant, portrayal, in, works, on, mythology, until, the, present, day, aphrodite, s, main, attendants, were, the, three, charites, whom, hesiod, identifies, as, the, daughters, of, zeus, and, eurynome, and, names, as, aglaea, splendor, euphrosyne, good, cheer, and, thalia, abundance, the, charites, had, been, worshipped, as, goddesses, in, greece, since, the, beginning, of, greek, history, long, before, aphrodite, was, introduced, to, the, pantheon, aphrodite, s, other, set, of, attendants, was, the, three, horae, the, hours, whom, hesiod, identifies, as, the, daughters, of, zeus, and, themis, and, names, as, eunomia, good, order, dike, justice, and, eirene, peace, aphrodite, was, also, sometimes, accompanied, by, harmonia, her, daughter, by, ares, and, hebe, the, daughter, of, zeus, and, hera, the, fertility, god, priapus, was, usually, considered, to, be, aphrodite, s, son, by, dionysus, but, he, was, sometimes, also, described, as, her, son, by, hermes, adonis, or, even, zeus, a, scholion, on, apollonius, of, rhodes, s, argonautica, states, that, while, aphrodite, was, pregnant, with, priapus, hera, envied, her, and, applied, an, evil, potion, to, her, belly, while, she, was, sleeping, to, ensure, that, the, child, would, be, hideous, in, another, version, hera, cursed, aphrodite, s, unborn, son, because, he, had, been, fathered, by, zeus, when, aphrodite, gave, birth, she, was, horrified, to, see, that, the, child, had, a, massive, permanently, erect, penis, a, potbelly, and, a, huge, tongue, aphrodite, abandoned, the, infant, to, die, in, the, wilderness, but, a, herdsman, found, him, and, raised, him, later, discovering, that, priapus, could, use, his, massive, penis, to, aid, in, the, growth, of, plants, the, first, homeric, hymn, to, aphrodite, hymn, 5, which, was, probably, composed, sometime, in, the, mid, seventh, century, bc, describes, how, zeus, once, became, annoyed, with, aphrodite, for, causing, deities, to, fall, in, love, with, mortals, so, he, caused, her, to, fall, in, love, with, anchises, a, handsome, mortal, shepherd, who, lived, in, the, foothills, beneath, mount, ida, near, the, city, of, troy, aphrodite, appears, to, anchises, in, the, form, of, a, tall, beautiful, mortal, virgin, while, he, is, alone, in, his, home, anchises, sees, her, dressed, in, bright, clothing, and, gleaming, jewelry, with, her, breasts, shining, with, divine, radiance, he, asks, her, if, she, is, aphrodite, and, promises, to, build, her, an, altar, on, top, of, the, mountain, if, she, will, bless, him, and, his, family, aphrodite, lies, and, tells, him, that, she, is, not, a, goddess, but, the, daughter, of, one, of, the, noble, families, of, phrygia, she, claims, to, be, able, to, understand, the, trojan, language, because, she, had, a, trojan, nurse, as, a, child, and, says, that, she, found, herself, on, the, mountainside, after, she, was, snatched, up, by, hermes, while, dancing, in, a, celebration, in, honor, of, artemis, the, goddess, of, virginity, aphrodite, tells, anchises, that, she, is, still, a, virgin, and, begs, him, to, take, her, to, his, parents, anchises, immediately, becomes, overcome, with, mad, lust, for, aphrodite, and, swears, that, he, will, have, sex, with, her, anchises, takes, aphrodite, with, her, eyes, cast, downwards, to, his, bed, which, is, covered, in, the, furs, of, lions, and, bears, he, then, strips, her, naked, and, makes, love, to, her, after, the, lovemaking, is, complete, aphrodite, reveals, her, true, divine, form, anchises, is, terrified, but, aphrodite, consoles, him, and, promises, that, she, will, bear, him, a, son, she, prophesies, that, their, son, will, be, the, demigod, aeneas, who, will, be, raised, by, the, nymphs, of, the, wilderness, for, five, years, before, going, to, troy, to, become, a, nobleman, like, his, father, the, story, of, aeneas, s, conception, is, also, mentioned, in, hesiod, s, theogony, and, in, book, ii, of, homer, s, iliad, the, myth, of, aphrodite, and, adonis, is, probably, derived, from, the, ancient, sumerian, legend, of, inanna, and, dumuzid, the, greek, name, ad, nis, greek, pronunciation, is, derived, from, the, canaanite, word, ad, n, meaning, lord, the, earliest, known, greek, reference, to, adonis, comes, from, a, fragment, of, a, poem, by, the, lesbian, poet, sappho, c, 630, c, 570, bc, in, which, a, chorus, of, young, girls, asks, aphrodite, what, they, can, do, to, mourn, adonis, s, death, aphrodite, replies, that, they, must, beat, their, breasts, and, tear, their, tunics, later, references, flesh, out, the, story, with, more, details, according, to, the, retelling, of, the, story, found, in, the, poem, metamorphoses, by, the, roman, poet, ovid, 43, bc, 17, 18, ad, adonis, was, the, son, of, myrrha, who, was, cursed, by, aphrodite, with, insatiable, lust, for, her, own, father, king, cinyras, of, cyprus, after, myrrha, s, mother, bragged, that, her, daughter, was, more, beautiful, than, the, goddess, driven, out, after, becoming, pregnant, myrrha, was, changed, into, a, myrrh, tree, but, still, gave, birth, to, adonis, aphrodite, found, the, baby, and, took, him, to, the, underworld, to, be, fostered, by, persephone, she, returned, for, him, once, he, was, grown, and, discovered, him, to, be, strikingly, handsome, persephone, wanted, to, keep, adonis, resulting, in, a, custody, battle, between, the, two, goddesses, over, whom, should, rightly, possess, adonis, zeus, settled, the, dispute, by, decreeing, that, adonis, would, spend, one, third, of, the, year, with, aphrodite, one, third, with, persephone, and, one, third, with, whomever, he, chose, adonis, chose, to, spend, that, time, with, aphrodite, then, one, day, while, adonis, was, hunting, he, was, wounded, by, a, wild, boar, and, bled, to, death, in, aphrodite, s, arms, in, a, semi, mocking, work, the, dialogues, of, the, gods, the, satirical, author, lucian, comedically, relates, how, a, frustrated, aphrodite, complains, to, the, moon, goddess, selene, about, her, son, eros, making, persephone, fall, in, love, with, adonis, and, now, she, has, to, share, him, with, her, in, different, versions, of, the, story, the, boar, was, either, sent, by, ares, who, was, jealous, that, aphrodite, was, spending, so, much, time, with, adonis, or, by, artemis, who, wanted, revenge, against, aphrodite, for, having, killed, her, devoted, follower, hippolytus, in, another, version, apollo, in, fury, changed, himself, into, a, boar, and, killed, adonis, because, aphrodite, had, blinded, his, son, erymanthus, when, he, stumbled, upon, aphrodite, naked, as, she, was, bathing, after, intercourse, with, adonis, the, story, also, provides, an, etiology, for, aphrodite, s, associations, with, certain, flowers, reportedly, as, she, mourned, adonis, s, death, she, caused, anemones, to, grow, wherever, his, blood, fell, and, declared, a, festival, on, the, anniversary, of, his, death, in, one, version, of, the, story, aphrodite, injured, herself, on, a, thorn, from, a, rose, bush, and, the, rose, which, had, previously, been, white, was, stained, red, by, her, blood, according, to, lucian, s, on, the, syrian, goddess, each, year, during, the, festival, of, adonis, the, adonis, river, in, lebanon, now, known, as, the, abraham, river, ran, red, with, blood, the, myth, of, adonis, is, associated, with, the, festival, of, the, adonia, which, was, celebrated, by, greek, women, every, year, in, midsummer, the, festival, which, was, evidently, already, celebrated, in, lesbos, by, sappho, s, time, seems, to, have, first, become, popular, in, athens, in, the, mid, fifth, century, bc, at, the, start, of, the, festival, the, women, would, plant, a, garden, of, adonis, a, small, garden, planted, inside, a, small, basket, or, a, shallow, piece, of, broken, pottery, containing, a, variety, of, quick, growing, plants, such, as, lettuce, and, fennel, or, even, quick, sprouting, grains, such, as, wheat, and, barley, the, women, would, then, climb, ladders, to, the, roofs, of, their, houses, where, they, would, place, the, gardens, out, under, the, heat, of, the, summer, sun, the, plants, would, sprout, in, the, sunlight, but, wither, quickly, in, the, heat, then, the, women, would, mourn, and, lament, loudly, over, the, death, of, adonis, tearing, their, clothes, and, beating, their, breasts, in, a, public, display, of, grief, in, hesiod, s, works, and, days, zeus, orders, aphrodite, to, make, pandora, the, first, woman, physically, beautiful, and, sexually, attractive, so, that, she, may, become, an, evil, men, will, love, to, embrace, aphrodite, spills, grace, over, pandora, s, head, and, equips, her, with, painful, desire, and, knee, weakening, anguish, thus, making, her, the, perfect, vessel, for, evil, to, enter, the, world, aphrodite, s, attendants, peitho, the, charites, and, the, horae, adorn, pandora, with, gold, and, jewelry, according, to, one, myth, aphrodite, aided, hippomenes, a, noble, youth, who, wished, to, marry, atalanta, a, maiden, who, was, renowned, throughout, the, land, for, her, beauty, but, who, refused, to, marry, any, man, unless, he, could, outrun, her, in, a, footrace, atalanta, was, an, exceedingly, swift, runner, and, she, beheaded, all, of, the, men, who, lost, to, her, aphrodite, gave, hippomenes, three, golden, apples, from, the, garden, of, the, hesperides, and, instructed, him, to, toss, them, in, front, of, atalanta, as, he, raced, her, hippomenes, obeyed, aphrodite, s, order, and, atalanta, seeing, the, beautiful, golden, fruits, bent, down, to, pick, up, each, one, allowing, hippomenes, to, outrun, her, in, the, version, of, the, story, from, ovid, s, metamorphoses, hippomenes, forgets, to, repay, aphrodite, for, her, aid, so, she, causes, the, couple, to, become, inflamed, with, lust, while, they, are, staying, at, the, temple, of, cybele, the, couple, desecrate, the, temple, by, having, sex, in, it, leading, cybele, to, turn, them, into, lions, as, punishment, the, myth, of, pygmalion, is, first, mentioned, by, the, third, century, bc, greek, writer, philostephanus, of, cyrene, but, is, first, recounted, in, detail, in, ovid, s, metamorphoses, according, to, ovid, pygmalion, was, an, exceedingly, handsome, sculptor, from, the, island, of, cyprus, who, was, so, sickened, by, the, immorality, of, women, that, he, refused, to, marry, he, fell, madly, and, passionately, in, love, with, the, ivory, cult, statue, he, was, carving, of, aphrodite, and, longed, to, marry, it, because, pygmalion, was, extremely, pious, and, devoted, to, aphrodite, the, goddess, brought, the, statue, to, life, pygmalion, married, the, girl, the, statue, became, and, they, had, a, son, named, paphos, after, whom, the, capital, of, cyprus, received, its, name, pseudo, apollodorus, later, mentions, metharme, daughter, of, pygmalion, king, of, cyprus, aphrodite, generously, rewarded, those, who, honored, her, but, also, punished, those, who, disrespected, her, often, quite, brutally, a, myth, described, in, apollonius, of, rhodes, s, argonautica, and, later, summarized, in, the, bibliotheca, of, pseudo, apollodorus, tells, how, when, the, women, of, the, island, of, lemnos, refused, to, sacrifice, to, aphrodite, the, goddess, cursed, them, to, stink, horribly, so, that, their, husbands, would, never, have, sex, with, them, instead, their, husbands, started, having, sex, with, their, thracian, slave, girls, in, anger, the, women, of, lemnos, murdered, the, entire, male, population, of, the, island, as, well, as, all, the, thracian, slaves, when, jason, and, his, crew, of, argonauts, arrived, on, lemnos, they, mated, with, the, sex, starved, women, under, aphrodite, s, approval, and, repopulated, the, island, from, then, on, the, women, of, lemnos, never, disrespected, aphrodite, again, in, euripides, s, tragedy, hippolytus, which, was, first, performed, at, the, city, dionysia, in, 428, bc, theseus, s, son, hippolytus, worships, only, artemis, the, goddess, of, virginity, and, refuses, to, engage, in, any, form, of, sexual, contact, aphrodite, is, infuriated, by, his, prideful, behavior, and, in, the, prologue, to, the, play, she, declares, that, by, honoring, only, artemis, and, refusing, to, venerate, her, hippolytus, has, directly, challenged, her, authority, aphrodite, therefore, causes, hippolytus, s, stepmother, phaedra, to, fall, in, love, with, him, knowing, hippolytus, will, reject, her, after, being, rejected, phaedra, commits, suicide, and, leaves, a, suicide, note, to, theseus, telling, him, that, she, killed, herself, because, hippolytus, attempted, to, rape, her, theseus, prays, to, poseidon, to, kill, hippolytus, for, his, transgression, poseidon, sends, a, wild, bull, to, scare, hippolytus, s, horses, as, he, is, riding, by, the, sea, in, his, chariot, causing, the, horses, to, bolt, and, smash, the, chariot, against, the, cliffs, dragging, hippolytus, to, a, bloody, death, across, the, rocky, shoreline, the, play, concludes, with, artemis, vowing, to, kill, aphrodite, s, own, mortal, beloved, presumably, adonis, in, revenge, glaucus, of, corinth, angered, aphrodite, by, refusing, to, let, his, horses, for, chariot,

into, birds, of, ill, omen, according, to, apollodorus, a, jealous, aphrodite, cursed, eos, the, goddess, of, dawn, to, be, perpetually, in, love, and, have, insatiable, sexual, desire, because, eos, once, had, lain, with, aphrodite, s, sweetheart, ares, the, god, of, war, according, to, ovid, in, his, metamorphoses, book, 10, 238, ff, propoetides, who, are, the, daughters, of, propoetus, from, the, city, of, amathus, on, the, island, of, cyprus, denied, aphrodite, s, divinity, and, failed, to, worship, her, properly, therefore, aphrodite, turned, them, into, the, world, s, first, prostitutes, according, to, diodorus, siculus, when, the, rhodian, sea, nymphe, halia, s, six, sons, by, poseidon, arrogantly, refused, to, let, aphrodite, land, upon, their, shore, the, goddess,

the, girl, was, already, betrothed, to, another, man, and, he, went, on, to, inform, her, father, xanthius, without, telling, him, the, name, of, the, seducer, xanthius, went, straight, to, his, daughter, s, chamber, where, she, was, together, with, leucippus, right, at, the, moment, on, hearing, him, enter, she, tried, to, escape, but, xanthius, hit, her, with, a, dagger, thinking, that, he, was, slaying, the, seducer, and, killed, her, leucippus, failing, to, recognize, his, father, at, first, slew, him, when, the, truth, was, revealed, he, had, to, leave, the, country, and, took, part, in, colonization, of, crete, and, the, lands, in, asia, minor, queen, cenchreis, of, cyprus, wife, of, king, cinyras, bragged, that, her, daughter, myrrha, was, more, beautiful, than, aphrodite, therefore, myrrha, was, cursed, by, aphrodite, with, insatiable, lust, for, her, own, father, king, cinyras, of, cyprus, and, he, slept, with, her, unknowingly, in, the, dark, she, eventually, transformed, into, the, myrrh, tree, and, gave, birth, to, adonis, in, this, form, cinyras, also, had, three, other, daughters, braesia, laogora, and, orsedice, these, girls, by, the, wrath, of, aphrodite, reasons, unknown, cohabited, with, foreigners, and, ended, their, life, in, egypt, the, muse, clio, derided, the, goddess, own, love, for, adonis, therefore, clio, fell, in, love, with,

and, hesiod, while, tyndareus, sacrificing, to, the, gods, he, forgot, aphrodite, therefore, the, goddess, made, his, daughters, twice, and, thrice, wed, and, deserters, of, their, husbands, timandra, deserted, echemus, and, went, and, came, to, phyleus, and, clytaemnestra, deserted, agamemnon, and, lay, with, aegisthus, who, was, a, worse, mate, for, her, and, eventually, killed, her, husband, with, her, lover, and, finally, helen, of, troy, deserted, menelaus, under, the, influence, of, aphrodite, for, paris, and, her, unfaitfulness, eventually, causes, the, war, of, troy, as, a, result, of, her, actions, aphrodite, caused, the, war, of, troy, in, order, to, take, priam, s, kingdom, and, pass, it, down, to, her, descendants, in, one, of, the, versions, of, the, legend, pasiphae, did, not, make, offerings, to, the, goddess, venus, because, of, this, venus, inspired, in, her, an, unnatural, love, for, a, bull, or, she, cursed, her, because, she, was, helios, s, daughter, who, revealed, her, adultery, to, hephaestus, for, helios, own, tale, telling, she, cursed, him, with, uncontrollable, lust, over, the, mortal, princess, leucothoe, which, led, to, him, abandoning, his, then, lover, clytie, leaving, her, heartbroken, lysippe, was, the, mother, of, tanais, by, berossos, her, son, only, venerated, ares, and, was, fully, devoted, to, war, neglecting, love, and, marriage, aphrodite, cursed, him, with, falling, in, love, with, his, own, mother, preferring, to, die, rather, than, give, up, his, chastity, he, threw, himself, into, the, river, amazonius, which, was, subsequently, renamed, tanais, according, to, hyginus, at, the, behest, of, zeus, orpheus, s, mother, the, muse, calliope, judged, the, dispute, between, the, goddesses, aphrodite, and, persephone, over, adonis, and, decided, that, both, shall, possess, him, half, of, the, year, this, enraged, venus, because, she, had, not, been, granted, what, she, thought, was, her, right, therefore, venus, inspired, love, for, orpheus, in, the, women, of, thrace, causing, them, to, tear, him, apart, as, each, of, them, sought, orpheus, for, herself, aphrodite, personally, witnessed, the, young, huntress, rhodopis, swear, eternal, devotion, and, chastity, to, artemis, when, she, joined, her, group, aphrodite, then, summoned, her, son, eros, and, convinced, him, that, such, lifestyle, was, an, insult, to, them, both, so, under, her, command, eros, made, rhodopis, and, euthynicus, another, young, hunter, who, had, shunned, love, and, romance, just, like, her, to, fall, in, love, with, each, other, despite, their, chaste, life, rhodopis, and, euthynicus, withdrew, to, some, cavern, where, they, violated, their, vows, artemis, was, not, slow, to, take, notice, after, seeing, aphrodite, laugh, so, she, changed, rhodopis, into, a, fountain, as, a, punishment, the, myth, of, the, judgement, of, paris, is, mentioned, briefly, in, the, iliad, but, is, described, in, depth, in, an, epitome, of, the, cypria, a, lost, poem, of, the, epic, cycle, which, records, that, all, the, gods, and, goddesses, as, well, as, various, mortals, were, invited, to, the, marriage, of, peleus, and, thetis, the, eventual, parents, of, achilles, only, eris, goddess, of, discord, was, not, invited, she, was, annoyed, at, this, so, she, arrived, with, a, golden, apple, inscribed, with, the, word, kallist, i, for, the, fairest, which, she, threw, among, the, goddesses, aphrodite, hera, and, athena, all, claimed, to, be, the, fairest, and, thus, the, rightful, owner, of, the, apple, the, goddesses, chose, to, place, the, matter, before, zeus, who, not, wanting, to, favor, one, of, the, goddesses, put, the, choice, into, the, hands, of, paris, a, trojan, prince, after, bathing, in, the, spring, of, mount, ida, where, troy, was, situated, the, goddesses, appeared, before, paris, for, his, decision, in, the, extant, ancient, depictions, of, the, judgement, of, paris, aphrodite, is, only, occasionally, represented, nude, and, athena, and, hera, are, always, fully, clothed, since, the, renaissance, however, western, paintings, have, typically, portrayed, all, three, goddesses, as, completely, naked, all, three, goddesses, were, ideally, beautiful, and, paris, could, not, decide, between, them, so, they, resorted, to, bribes, hera, tried, to, bribe, paris, with, power, over, all, asia, and, europe, and, athena, offered, wisdom, fame, and, glory, in, battle, but, aphrodite, promised, paris, that, if, he, were, to, choose, her, as, the, fairest, she, would, let, him, marry, the, most, beautiful, woman, on, earth, this, woman, was, helen, who, was, already, married, to, king, menelaus, of, sparta, paris, selected, aphrodite, and, awarded, her, the, apple, the, other, two, goddesses, were, enraged, and, as, a, direct, result, sided, with, the, greeks, in, the, trojan, war, aphrodite, plays, an, important, and, active, role, throughout, the, entirety, of, homer, s, iliad, in, book, iii, she, rescues, paris, from, menelaus, after, he, foolishly, challenges, him, to, a, one, on, one, duel, she, then, appears, to, helen, in, the, form, of, an, old, woman, and, attempts, to, persuade, her, to, have, sex, with, paris, reminding, her, of, his, physical, beauty, and, athletic, prowess, helen, immediately, recognizes, aphrodite, by, her, beautiful, neck, perfect, breasts, and, flashing, eyes, and, chides, the, goddess, addressing, her, as, her, equal, aphrodite, sharply, rebukes, helen, reminding, her, that, if, she, vexes, her, she, will, punish, her, just, as, much, as, she, has, favored, her, already, helen, demurely, obeys, aphrodite, s, command, in, book, v, aphrodite, charges, into, battle, to, rescue, her, son, aeneas, from, the,

mosaics, of, aphrodite, and, reinterpreted, her, as, a, symbol, of, the, sin, of, lust, arguing, that, she, was, shown, naked, because, the, sin, of, lust, is, never, cloaked, and, that, she, was, often, shown, swimming, because, all, lust, suffers, shipwreck, of, its, affairs, he, also, argued, that, she, was, associated, with, doves, and, conches, because, these, are, symbols, of, copulation, and, that, she, was, associated, with, roses, because, as, the, rose, gives, pleasure, but, is, swept, away, by, the, swift, movement, of, the, seasons, so, lust, is, pleasant, for, a, moment, but, is, swept, away, forever, while, fulgentius, had, appropriated, aphrodite, as, a, symbol, of, lust, isidore, of, seville, c, 560, 636, interpreted, her, as, a, symbol, of, marital, procreative, sex, and, declared, that, the, moral, of, the, story, of, aphrodite, s, birth, is, that, sex, can, only, be, holy, in, the, presence, of, semen, blood, and, heat, which, he, regarded, as, all, being, necessary, for, procreation, meanwhile, isidore, denigrated, aphrodite, venus, s, son, eros, cupid, as, a, demon, of, fornication, daemon, fornicationis, aphrodite, venus, was, best, known, to,

paintings, in, the, world, and, one, of, the, most, popular, paintings, in, western, art, the, story, of, aphrodite, s, birth, from, the, foam, was, a, popular, subject, matter, for, painters, during, the, italian, renaissance, who, were, attempting, to, consciously, reconstruct, apelles, of, kos, s, lost, masterpiece, aphrodite, anadyomene, based, on, the, literary, ekphrasis, of, it, preserved, by, cicero, and, pliny, the, elder, artists, also, drew, inspiration, from, ovid, s, description, of, the, birth, of, venus, in, his, metamorphoses, sandro, botticelli, s, the, birth, of, venus, c, 1485, was, also, partially, inspired, by, a, description, by, poliziano, of, a, relief, on, the, subject, later, italian, renditions, of, the, same, scene, include, titian, s, venus, anadyomene, c, 1525, and, raphael, s, painting, in, the, stufetta, del, cardinal, bibbiena, 1516, titian, s, biographer, giorgio, vasari, identified, all, of, titian, s, paintings, of, naked, women, as, paintings, of, venus, including, an, erotic, painting, from, c, 1534, which, he, called, the, venus, of, urbino, even, though, the, painting, does, not, contain, any, of, aphrodite, venus, s, traditional, iconography, and, the, woman, in, it, is, clearly, shown, in, a, contemporary, setting, not, a, classical, one, the, birth, of, venus, 1863, by, alexandre, cabanel, jacques, louis, david, s, final,

it, jean, auguste, dominique, ingres, s, painting, venus, anadyomene, was, one, of, his, major, works, louis, geofroy, described, it, as, a, dream, of, youth, realized, with, the, power, of, maturity, a, happiness, that, few, obtain, artists, or, others, th, ophile, gautier, declared, nothing, remains, of, the, marvelous, painting, of, the, greeks, but, surely, if, anything, could, give, the, idea, of, antique, painting, as, it, was, conceived, following, the, statues, of, phidias, and, the, poems, of, homer, it, is, m, ingres, s, painting, the, venus, anadyomene, of, apelles, has, been, found, other, critics, dismissed, it, as, a, piece, of, unimaginative, sentimental, kitsch, but, ingres, himself, considered, it, to, be, among, his, greatest, works, and, used, the, same, figure, as, the, model, for, his, later, 1856, painting, la, source, paintings, of, venus, were, favorites, of, the, late, nineteenth, century, academic, artists, in, france, in, 1863, alexandre, cabanel, won,

frederic, leighton, displayed, his, venus, disrobing, for, the, bath, at, the, academy, the, art, critic, j, b, atkinson, praised, it, declaring, that, mr, leighton, instead, of, adopting, corrupt, roman, notions, regarding, venus, such, as, rubens, embodied, has, wisely, reverted, to, the, greek, idea, of, aphrodite, a, goddess, worshipped, and, by, artists, painted, as, the, perfection, of, female, grace, and, beauty, a, year, later, the, english, painter, dante, gabriel, rossetti, a, founding, member, of, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, painted, venus, verticordia, latin, for,

imitated, the, classical, tradition, of, contrapposto, and, was, met, with, widespread, critical, acclaim, rivalling, the, popularity, of, cabanel, s, version, from, nearly, two, decades, prior, william, shakespeare, s, erotic, narrative, poem, venus, and, adonis, 1593, a, retelling, of, the, courtship, of, aphrodite, and, adonis, from, ovid, s, metamorphoses, was, the, most, popular, of,
