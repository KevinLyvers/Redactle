reportedly, haunted, locations, in, folklore, a, werewolf, from, old, english, werwulf, man, wolf, or, occasionally, lycanthrope, from, ancient, greek, lyk, nthr, pos, wolf, human, is, an, individual, who, can, shape, shift, into, a, wolf, or, especially, in, modern, film, a, therianthropic, hybrid, wolf, like, creature, either, purposely, or, after, being, placed, under, a, curse, or, affliction, often, a, bite, or, the, occasional, scratch, from, another, werewolf, with, the, transformations, occurring, on, the, night, of, a, full, moon, early, sources, for, belief, in, this, ability, or, affliction, called, lycanthropy, are, petronius, 27, 66, and, gervase, of, tilbury, 1150, 1228, the, werewolf, is, a, widespread, concept, in, european, folklore, existing, in, many, variants, which, are, related, by, a, common, development, of, a, christian, interpretation, of, underlying, european, folklore, developed, during, the, medieval, period, from, the, early, modern, period, werewolf, beliefs, spread, to, the, new, world, with, colonialism, belief, in, werewolves, developed, in, parallel, to, the, belief, in, witches, during, the, late, middle, ages, and, the, early, modern, period, like, the, witchcraft, trials, as, a, whole, the, trial, of, supposed, werewolves, emerged, in, what, is, now, switzerland, especially, the, valais, and, vaud, in, the, early, 15th, century, and, spread, throughout, europe, in, the, 16th, peaking, in, the, 17th, and, subsiding, by, the, 18th, century, the, persecution, of, werewolves, and, the, associated, folklore, is, an, integral, part, of, the, witch, hunt, phenomenon, albeit, a, marginal, one, accusations, of, lycanthropy, being, involved, in, only, a, small, fraction, of, witchcraft, trials, during, the, early, period, accusations, of, lycanthropy, transformation, into, a, wolf, were, mixed, with, accusations, of, wolf, riding, or, wolf, charming, the, case, of, peter, stumpp, 1589, led, to, a, significant, peak, in, both, interest, in, and, persecution, of, supposed, werewolves, primarily, in, french, speaking, and, german, speaking, europe, the, phenomenon, persisted, longest, in, bavaria, and, austria, with, persecution, of, wolf, charmers, recorded, until, well, after, 1650, the, final, cases, taking, place, in, the, early, 18th, century, in, carinthia, and, styria, after, the, end, of, the, witch, trials, the, werewolf, became, of, interest, in, folklore, studies, and, in, the, emerging, gothic, horror, genre, werewolf, fiction, as, a, genre, has, premodern, precedents, in, medieval, romances, e, g, bisclavret, and, guillaume, de, palerme, and, developed, in, the, 18th, century, out, of, the, semi, fictional, chapbook, tradition, the, trappings, of, horror, literature, in, the, 20th, century, became, part, of, the, horror, and, fantasy, genre, of, modern, popular, culture, the, modern, english, werewolf, descends, from, the, old, english, wer, e, wulf, which, is, a, cognate, of, middle, dutch, weerwolf, middle, low, german, warwulf, werwulf, middle, high, german, werwolf, and, west, frisian, waer, l, e, these, terms, are, generally, derived, from, a, proto, germanic, form, reconstructed, as, wira, wulfaz, man, wolf, itself, from, an, earlier, pre, germanic, form, wiro, wulpos, an, alternative, reconstruction, wazi, wulfaz, wolf, clothed, would, bring, the, germanic, compound, closer, to, the, slavic, meaning, with, other, semantic, parallels, in, old, norse, lfhe, nar, wolf, skinned, and, lfhe, inn, wolf, coat, old, irish, luchthonn, wolf, skin, and, sanskrit, v, k, jina, wolf, skin, the, norse, branch, underwent, taboo, modifications, with, old, norse, varg, lfr, only, attested, as, a, translation, of, old, french, garwaf, garwal, f, from, marie, s, lay, of, bisclavret, replacing, wiraz, man, with, vargr, wolf, outlaw, perhaps, under, the, influence, of, the, old, french, expression, leus, warous, lous, garous, modern, loup, garou, which, literally, means, wolf, werewolf, the, modern, norse, form, varulv, danish, norwegian, and, swedish, was, either, borrowed, from, middle, low, german, werwulf, or, else, derived, from, an, unattested, old, norse, varulfr, posited, as, the, regular, descendant, of, proto, germanic, wira, wulfaz, an, old, frankish, form, werwolf, is, inferred, from, the, middle, low, german, variant, and, was, most, likely, borrowed, into, old, norman, garwa, l, f, garo, u, l, with, regular, germanic, romance, correspondence, w, g, cf, william, guillaume, wales, galles, etc, the, proto, slavic, noun, v, lko, dlak, meaning, wolf, haired, cf, dlaka, animal, hair, fur, can, be, reconstructed, from, serbian, vuk, dlak, slovenian, vo, kodl, k, and, czech, vlkodlak, although, formal, variations, in, slavic, languages, v, rdl, j, ak, v, lkdolk, v, lklak, and, the, late, attestation, of, some, forms, pose, difficulties, in, tracing, the, origin, of, the, term, the, greek, vrykolakas, and, romanian, v, rcolac, designating, vampire, like, creatures, in, balkan, folklores, were, borrowed, from, slavic, languages, the, same, form, is, found, in, other, non, slavic, languages, of, the, region, such, as, albanian, vurvolak, and, turkish, vurkolak, bulgarian, v, rkolak, and, church, slavonic, vurkolak, may, be, interpreted, as, back, borrowings, from, greek, the, name, vurdalak, ghoul, revenant, first, appeared, in, russian, poet, alexander, pushkin, s, work, pesni, published, in, 1835, the, source, of, pushkin, s, distinctive, form, remains, debated, in, scholarship, a, proto, celtic, noun, wiro, k, meaning, man, dog, has, been, reconstructed, from, celtiberian, uiroku, the, old, brittonic, place, name, viroconium, wiroconion, place, of, man, dogs, i, e, werewolves, the, old, irish, noun, ferchu, male, dog, fierce, dog, and, the, medieval, personal, names, guurci, old, welsh, and, gurki, old, breton, wolves, were, metaphorically, designated, as, dogs, in, celtic, cultures, the, modern, term, lycanthropy, comes, from, ancient, greek, lukanthr, p, a, itself, from, luk, nthr, pos, meaning, wolf, man, ancient, writers, used, the, term, solely, in, the, context, of, clinical, lycanthropy, a, condition, in, which, the, patient, imagined, himself, to, be, a, wolf, modern, writers, later, used, lycanthrope, as, a, synonym, of, werewolf, referring, to, a, person, who, according, to, medieval, superstition, could, assume, the, form, of, wolves, the, european, motif, of, the, devilish, werewolf, devouring, human, flesh, harks, back, to, a, common, development, during, the, middle, ages, in, the, context, of, christianity, although, stories, of, humans, turning, into, wolves, take, their, roots, in, earlier, pre, christian, beliefs, their, underlying, common, origin, can, be, traced, back, to, proto, indo, european, mythology, where, lycanthropy, is, reconstructed, as, an, aspect, of, the, initiation, of, the, k, ryos, warrior, class, which, may, have, included, a, cult, focused, on, dogs, and, wolves, identified, with, an, age, grade, of, young, unmarried, warriors, the, standard, comparative, overview, of, this, aspect, of, indo, european, mythology, is, mccone, 1987, a, few, references, to, men, changing, into, wolves, are, found, in, ancient, greek, literature, and, folklore, herodotus, in, his, histories, wrote, that, according, to, what, the, scythians, and, the, greeks, settled, in, scythia, told, him, the, neuri, which, was, a, tribe, to, the, north, east, of, scythia, were, all, transformed, into, wolves, once, every, year, for, several, days, and, then, changed, back, to, their, human, shape, he, added, that, he, is, not, convinced, by, the, story, but, the, locals, swear, to, its, truth, this, tale, was, also, mentioned, by, pomponius, mela, in, the, second, century, bc, the, greek, geographer, pausanias, related, the, story, of, king, lycaon, of, arcadia, who, was, transformed, into, a, wolf, because, he, had, sacrificed, a, child, in, the, altar, of, zeus, lycaeus, in, the, version, of, the, legend, told, by, ovid, in, his, metamorphoses, when, zeus, visits, lycaon, disguised, as, a, common, man, lycaon, wants, to, test, if, he, is, really, a, god, to, that, end, he, kills, a, molossian, hostage, and, serve, his, entrails, to, zeus, disgusted, the, god, turns, lycaon, into, a, wolf, however, in, other, accounts, of, the, legend, like, that, of, apollodorus, bibliotheca, zeus, blasts, him, and, his, sons, with, thunderbolts, as, punishment, pausanias, also, relates, the, story, of, an, arcadian, man, called, damarchus, of, parrhasia, who, was, turned, into, a, wolf, after, tasting, the, entrails, of, a, human, child, sacrificed, to, zeus, lycaeus, he, was, restored, to, human, form, 10, years, later, and, went, on, to, become, an, olympic, champion, this, tale, is, also, recounted, by, pliny, the, elder, who, calls, the, man, demaenetus, quoting, agriopas, according, to, pausanias, this, was, not, a, one, off, event, but, that, men, have, been, transformed, into, wolves, during, the, sacrifices, to, zeus, lycaeus, since, the, time, of, lycaon, if, they, abstain, from, tasting, human, flesh, while, being, wolves, they, would, be, restored, to, human, form, nine, years, later, but, if, they, do, not, abstain, they, would, remain, wolves, forever, lykos, of, athens, was, a, wolf, shaped, her, whose, shrine, stood, by, the, jurycourt, and, the, first, jurors, were, named, after, him, pliny, the, elder, likewise, recounts, another, tale, of, lycanthropy, quoting, euanthes, he, mentions, that, in, arcadia, once, a, year, a, man, was, chosen, by, lot, from, the, anthus, clan, the, chosen, man, was, escorted, to, a, marsh, in, the, area, where, he, hung, his, clothes, into, an, oak, tree, swam, across, the, marsh, and, transformed, into, a, wolf, joining, a, pack, for, nine, years, if, during, these, nine, years, he, refrained, from, tasting, human, flesh, he, returned, to, the, same, marsh, swam, back, and, recovered, his, previous, human, form, with, nine, years, added, to, his, appearance, ovid, also, relates, stories, of, men, who, roamed, the, woods, of, arcadia, in, the, form, of, wolves, virgil, in, his, poetic, work, eclogues, wrote, about, a, man, called, moeris, who, used, herbs, and, poisons, picked, in, his, native, pontus, to, turn, himself, into, a, wolf, in, prose, the, satyricon, written, circa, ad, 60, by, gaius, petronius, arbiter, one, of, the, characters, niceros, tells, a, story, at, a, banquet, about, a, friend, who, turned, into, a, wolf, chs, 61, 62, he, describes, the, incident, as, follows, when, i, look, for, my, buddy, i, see, he, d, stripped, and, piled, his, clothes, by, the, roadside, he, pees, in, a, circle, round, his, clothes, and, then, just, like, that, turns, into, a, wolf, after, he, turned, into, a, wolf, he, started, howling, and, then, ran, off, into, the, woods, early, christian, authors, also, mentioned, werewolves, in, the, city, of, god, augustine, of, hippo, gives, an, account, similar, to, that, found, in, pliny, the, elder, augustine, explains, that, it, is, very, generally, believed, that, by, certain, witches, spells, men, may, be, turned, into, wolves, physical, metamorphosis, was, also, mentioned, in, the, capitulatum, episcopi, attributed, to, the, council, of, ancyra, in, the, 4th, century, which, became, the, church, s, doctrinal, text, in, relation, to, magic, witches, and, transformations, such, as, those, of, werewolves, the, capitulatum, episcopi, states, that, whoever, believes, that, anything, can, be, transformed, into, another, species, or, likeness, except, by, god, himself, is, beyond, doubt, an, infidel, in, these, works, of, roman, writers, werewolves, often, receive, the, name, versipellis, turnskin, augustine, instead, uses, the, phrase, in, lupum, fuisse, mutatum, changed, into, the, form, of, a, wolf, to, describe, the, physical, metamorphosis, of, werewolves, which, is, similar, to, phrases, used, in, the, medieval, period, there, is, evidence, of, widespread, belief, in, werewolves, in, medieval, europe, this, evidence, spans, much, of, the, continent, as, well, as, the, british, isles, werewolves, were, mentioned, in, medieval, law, codes, such, as, that, of, king, cnut, whose, ecclesiastical, ordinances, inform, us, that, the, codes, aim, to, ensure, that, the, madly, audacious, werewolf, do, not, too, widely, devastate, nor, bite, too, many, of, the, spiritual, flock, liutprand, of, cremona, reports, a, rumor, that, bajan, son, of, simeon, i, of, bulgaria, could, use, magic, to, turn, himself, into, a, wolf, the, works, of, augustine, of, hippo, had, a, large, influence, on, the, development, of, western, christianity, and, were, widely, read, by, churchmen, of, the, medieval, period, these, churchmen, occasionally, discussed, werewolves, in, their, works, famous, examples, include, gerald, of, wales, s, werewolves, of, ossory, found, in, his, topographica, hibernica, and, in, gervase, of, tilbury, s, otia, imperiala, both, written, for, royal, audiences, gervase, reveals, to, the, reader, that, belief, in, such, transformations, he, also, mentions, women, turning, into, cats, and, into, snakes, was, widespread, across, europe, he, uses, the, phrase, que, ita, dinoscuntur, when, discussing, these, metamorphoses, which, translates, to, it, is, known, gervase, who, was, writing, in, germany, also, tells, the, reader, that, the, transformation, of, men, into, wolves, cannot, be, easily, dismissed, for, in, england, we, have, often, seen, men, change, into, wolves, vidimus, enim, frequenter, in, anglia, per, lunationes, homines, in, lupos, mutari, further, evidence, of, the, widespread, belief, in, werewolves, and, other, human, animal, transformations, can, be, seen, in, theological, attacks, made, against, such, beliefs, conrad, of, hirsau, writing, in, the, 11th, century, forbids, the, reading, of, stories, in, which, a, person, s, reason, is, obscured, following, such, a, transformation, conrad, specifically, refers, to, the, tales, of, ovid, in, his, tract, pseudo, augustine, writing, in, the, 12th, century, follows, augustine, of, hippo, s, argument, that, no, physical, transformation, can, be, made, by, any, but, god, stating, that, the, body, corporeally, be, changed, into, the, material, limbs, of, any, animal, marie, de, france, s, poem, bisclavret, c, 1200, is, another, example, in, which, the, eponymous, nobleman, bisclavret, for, reasons, not, described, had, to, transform, into, a, wolf, every, week, when, his, treacherous, wife, stole, his, clothing, needed, to, restore, his, human, form, he, escaped, the, king, s, wolf, hunt, by, imploring, the, king, for, mercy, and, accompanied, the, king, thereafter, his, behavior, at, court, was, gentle, until, his, wife, and, her, new, husband, appeared, at, court, so, much, so, that, his, hateful, attack, on, the, couple, was, deemed, justly, motivated, and, the, truth, was, revealed, this, lai, a, type, of, breton, sung, poem, follows, many, themes, found, within, other, werewolf, tales, the, removal, of, clothing, and, attempting, to, refrain, from, the, consumption, of, human, flesh, can, be, found, in, pliny, the, elder, as, well, as, in, the, second, of, gervase, of, tilbury, s, werewolf, stories, about, a, werewolf, by, the, name, of, chaucevaire, marie, also, reveals, to, us, the, existence, of, werewolf, belief, in, breton, and, norman, france, by, telling, us, the, franco, norman, word, for, werewolf, garwulf, which, she, explains, are, common, in, that, part, of, france, where, many, men, turned, into, werewolves, gervase, supports, this, terminology, when, he, tells, us, that, the, french, use, the, term, gerulfi, to, describe, what, the, english, call, werewolves, melion, and, biclarel, are, two, anonymous, lais, that, share, the, theme, of, a, werewolf, knight, being, betrayed, by, his, wife, the, german, word, werwolf, was, recorded, by, burchard, von, worms, in, the, 11th, century, and, bertold, of, regensburg, in, the, 13th, century, but, is, not, recorded, in, all, of, medieval, german, poetry, or, fiction, while, baring, gould, argues, that, references, to, werewolves, were, rare, in, england, presumably, because, whatever, significance, the, wolf, men, of, germanic, paganism, had, carried, the, associated, beliefs, and, practices, had, been, successfully, repressed, after, christianization, or, if, they, persisted, they, did, so, outside, of, the, sphere, of, literacy, available, to, us, we, have, sources, other, than, those, mentioned, above, such, examples, of, werewolves, in, ireland, and, the, british, isles, can, be, found, in, the, work, of, the, 9th, century, welsh, monk, nennius, female, werewolves, appear, in, the, irish, work, tales, of, the, elders, from, the, 12th, century, and, welsh, werewolves, in, the, 12th, to, 13th, century, work, mabinogion, germanic, pagan, traditions, associated, with, wolf, men, persisted, longest, in, the, scandinavian, viking, age, harald, i, of, norway, is, known, to, have, had, a, body, of, lfhednar, wolf, coated, which, are, mentioned, in, the, vatnsd, la, haraldskv, i, and, the, v, lsunga, saga, and, resemble, some, werewolf, legends, the, lfhednar, were, fighters, similar, to, the, berserkers, though, they, dressed, in, wolf, hides, rather, than, those, of, bears, and, were, reputed, to, channel, the, spirits, of, these, animals, to, enhance, effectiveness, in, battle, these, warriors, were, resistant, to, pain, and, killed, viciously, in, battle, much, like, wild, animals, lfhednar, and, berserkers, are, closely, associated, with, the, norse, god, odin, the, scandinavian, traditions, of, this, period, may, have, spread, to, kievan, rus, giving, rise, to, the, slavic, werewolf, tales, the, 11th, century, belarusian, prince, vseslav, of, polotsk, was, considered, to, have, been, a, werewolf, capable, of, moving, at, superhuman, speeds, as, recounted, in, the, tale, of, igor, s, campaign, vseslav, the, prince, judged, men, as, prince, he, ruled, towns, but, at, night, he, prowled, in, the, guise, of, a, wolf, from, kiev, prowling, he, reached, before, the, cocks, crew, tmutorokan, the, path, of, great, sun, as, a, wolf, prowling, he, crossed, for, him, in, polotsk, they, rang, for, matins, early, at, st, sophia, the, bells, but, he, heard, the, ringing, in, kiev, the, situation, as, described, during, the, medieval, period, gives, rise, to, the, dual, form, of, werewolf, folklore, in, early, modern, europe, on, one, hand, the, germanic, werewolf, which, becomes, associated, with, the, witchcraft, panic, and, on, the, other, hand, the, slavic, werewolf, or, vlkolak, which, becomes, associated, with, the, concept, of, the, revenant, or, vampire, the, eastern, werewolf, vampire, is, found, in, the, folklore, of, central, and, eastern, europe, including, hungary, romania, and, the, balkans, while, the, western, werewolf, sorcerer, is, found, in, france, german, speaking, europe, and, in, the, baltic, being, a, werewolf, was, a, common, accusation, in, witch, trials, it, featured, in, the, valais, witch, trials, one, of, the, earliest, such, trials, in, the, first, half, of, the, 15th, century, in, 1539, martin, luther, used, the, form, beerwolf, to, describe, a, hypothetical, ruler, worse, than, a, tyrant, who, must, be, resisted, in, historia, de, gentibus, septentrionalibus, 1555, olaus, magnus, describes, book, 18, chapter, 45, an, annual, assembly, of, werewolves, near, the, lithuania, courland, border, the, participants, including, lithuanian, nobility, and, werewolves, from, the, surrounding, areas, gather, to, test, their, strength, by, attempting, to, jump, over, a, castle, wall, s, ruins, those, who, succeed, are, regarded, as, strong, while, weaker, participants, are, punished, with, whippings, there, were, numerous, reports, of, werewolf, attacks, and, consequent, court, trials, in, 16th, century, france, in, some, of, the, cases, there, was, clear, evidence, against, the, accused, of, murder, and, cannibalism, but, no, association, with, wolves, in, other, cases, people, have, been, terrified, by, such, creatures, such, as, that, of, gilles, garnier, in, dole, in, 1573, who, was, convicted, of, being, a, werewolf, a, peak, of, attention, to, lycanthropy, came, in, the, late, 16th, to, early, 17th, century, as, part, of, the, european, witch, hunts, a, number, of, treatises, on, werewolves, were, written, in, france, during, 1595, and, 1615, in, 1598, werewolves, were, sighted, in, anjou, in, 1602, henry, boguet, wrote, a, lengthy, chapter, about, werewolves, in, 1603, a, teenage, werewolf, was, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, in, bordeaux, in, the, swiss, vaud, region, werewolves, were, convicted, in, 1602, and, in, 1624, a, treatise, by, a, vaud, pastor, in, 1653, however, argued, that, lycanthropy, was, purely, an, illusion, after, this, the, only, further, record, from, the, vaud, dates, to, 1670, a, boy, claimed, he, and, his, mother, could, change, themselves, into, wolves, which, was, not, taken, seriously, at, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, witchcraft, was, prosecuted, by, james, i, of, england, who, regarded, warwoolfes, as, victims, of, delusion, induced, by, a, natural, superabundance, of, melancholic, after, 1650, belief, in, lycanthropy, had, mostly, disappeared, from, french, speaking, europe, as, evidenced, in, diderot, s, encyclopedia, which, attributed, reports, of, lycanthropy, to, a, disorder, of, the, brain, although, there, were, continuing, reports, of, extraordinary, wolflike, beasts, they, were, not, considered, to, be, werewolves, one, such, report, concerned, the, beast, of, g, vaudan, which, terrorized, the, general, area, of, the, former, province, of, g, vaudan, now, called, loz, re, in, south, central, france, from, 1764, to, 1767, it, killed, upwards, of, 80, men, women, and, children, the, part, of, europe, which, showed, more, vigorous, interest, in, werewolves, after, 1650, was, the, holy, roman, empire, at, least, nine, works, on, lycanthropy, were, printed, in, germany, between, 1649, and, 1679, in, the, austrian, and, bavarian, alps, belief, in, werewolves, persisted, well, into, the, 18th, century, as, late, as, in, 1853, in, galicia, northwestern, spain, manuel, blanco, romasanta, was, judged, and, condemned, as, the, author, of, a, number, of, murders, but, he, claimed, to, be, not, guilty, because, of, his, condition, of, lobishome, werewolf, until, the, 20th, century, wolf, attacks, on, humans, were, an, occasional, but, still, widespread, feature, of, life, in, europe, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, it, was, inevitable, that, wolves, being, the, most, feared, predators, in, europe, were, projected, into, the, folklore, of, evil, shapeshifters, this, is, said, to, be, corroborated, by, the, fact, that, areas, devoid, of, wolves, typically, use, different, kinds, of, predator, to, fill, the, niche, werehyenas, in, africa, weretigers, in, india, as, well, as, werepumas, runa, uturuncu, and, werejaguars, yaguarat, ab, or, tigre, capiango, in, southern, south, america, an, idea, is, explored, in, sabine, baring, gould, s, work, the, book, of, werewolves, is, that, werewolf, legends, may, have, been, used, to, explain, serial, killings, perhaps, the, most, infamous, example, is, the, case, of, peter, stumpp, executed, in, 1589, the, german, farmer, and, alleged, serial, killer, and, cannibal, also, known, as, the, werewolf, of, bedburg, common, turkic, folklore, holds, a, different, reverential, light, to, the, werewolf, legends, in, that, turkic, central, asian, shamans, after, performing, long, and, arduous, rites, would, voluntarily, be, able, to, transform, into, the, humanoid, kurtadam, literally, meaning, wolfman, since, the, wolf, was, the, totemic, ancestor, animal, of, the, turkic, peoples, they, would, be, respectful, of, any, shaman, who, was, in, such, a, form, some, modern, researchers, have, tried, to, explain, the, reports, of, werewolf, behaviour, with, recognised, medical, conditions, in, 1963, dr, lee, illis, of, guy, s, hospital, in, london, wrote, a, paper, entitled, on, porphyria, and, the, aetiology, of, werewolves, in, which, he, argues, that, historical, accounts, on, werewolves, could, have, been, referring, to, victims, of, congenital, porphyria, stating, how, the, symptoms, of, photosensitivity, reddish, teeth, and, psychosis, could, have, been, grounds, for, accusing, a, person, of, being, a, werewolf, this, is, argued, against, by, woodward, who, points, out, how, mythological, werewolves, were, almost, invariably, portrayed, as, resembling, true, wolves, and, that, their, human, forms, were, rarely, physically, conspicuous, as, porphyria, victims, others, have, pointed, out, the, possibility, of, historical, werewolves, having, been, people, with, hypertrichosis, a, hereditary, condition, manifesting, itself, in, excessive, hair, growth, woodward, dismissed, the, possibility, as, the, rarity, of, the, disease, ruled, it, out, from, happening, on, a, large, scale, as, werewolf, cases, were, in, medieval, europe, woodward, suggested, rabies, as, the, origin, of, werewolf, beliefs, claiming, remarkable, similarities, between, the, symptoms, of, that, disease, and, some, of, the, legends, woodward, focused, on, the, idea, that, being, bitten, by, a, werewolf, could, result, in, the, victim, turning, into, one, which, suggested, the, idea, of, a, transmittable, disease, like, rabies, however, the, idea, that, lycanthropy, could, be, transmitted, in, this, way, is, not, part, of, the, original, myths, and, legends, and, only, appears, in, relatively, recent, beliefs, lycanthropy, can, also, be, met, with, as, the, main, content, of, a, delusion, for, example, the, case, of, a, woman, has, been, reported, who, during, episodes, of, acute, psychosis, complained, of, becoming, four, different, species, of, animals, the, beliefs, classed, together, under, lycanthropy, are, far, from, uniform, and, the, term, is, somewhat, capriciously, applied, the, transformation, may, be, temporary, or, permanent, the, were, animal, may, be, the, man, himself, metamorphosed, may, be, his, double, whose, activity, leaves, the, real, man, to, all, appearance, unchanged, may, be, his, soul, which, goes, forth, seeking, whomever, it, may, devour, leaving, its, body, in, a, state, of, trance, or, it, may, be, no, more, than, the, messenger, of, the, human, being, a, real, animal, or, a, familiar, spirit, whose, intimate, connection, with, its, owner, is, shown, by, the, fact, that, any, injury, to, it, is, believed, by, a, phenomenon, known, as, repercussion, to, cause, a, corresponding, injury, to, the, human, being, werewolves, were, said, in, european, folklore, to, bear, tell, tale, physical, traits, even, in, their, human, form, these, included, the, meeting, of, both, eyebrows, at, the, bridge, of, the, nose, curved, fingernails, low, set, ears, and, a, swinging, stride, one, method, of, identifying, a, werewolf, in, its, human, form, was, to, cut, the, flesh, of, the, accused, under, the, pretense, that, fur, would, be, seen, within, the, wound, a, russian, superstition, recalls, a, werewolf, can, be, recognized, by, bristles, under, the, tongue, the, appearance, of, a, werewolf, in, its, animal, form, varies, from, culture, to, culture, it, is, most, commonly, portrayed, as, being, indistinguishable, from, ordinary, wolves, except, for, the, fact, that, it, has, no, tail, a, trait, thought, characteristic, of, witches, in, animal, form, is, often, larger, and, retains, human, eyes, and, a, voice, according, to, some, swedish, accounts, the, werewolf, could, be, distinguished, from, a, regular, wolf, by, the, fact, that, it, would, run, on, three, legs, stretching, the, fourth, one, backwards, to, look, like, a, tail, after, returning, to, their, human, forms, werewolves, are, usually, documented, as, becoming, weak, debilitated, and, undergoing, painful, nervous, depression, one, universally, reviled, trait, in, medieval, europe, was, the, werewolf, s, habit, of, devouring, recently, buried, corpses, a, trait, that, is, documented, extensively, particularly, in, the, annales, medico, psychologiques, in, the, 19th, century, various, methods, for, becoming, a, werewolf, have, been, reported, one, of, the, simplest, being, the, removal, of, clothing, and, putting, on, a, belt, made, of, wolfskin, probably, as, a, substitute, for, the, assumption, of, an, entire, animal, skin, which, also, is, frequently, described, in, other, cases, the, body, is, rubbed, with, a, magic, salve, drinking, rainwater, out, of, the, footprint, of, the, animal, in, question, or, from, certain, enchanted, streams, were, also, considered, effectual, modes, of, accomplishing, metamorphosis, the, 16th, century, swedish, writer, olaus, magnus, says, that, the, livonian, werewolves, were, initiated, by, draining, a, cup, of, specially, prepared, beer, and, repeating, a, set, formula, ralston, in, his, songs, of, the, russian, people, gives, the, form, of, incantation, still, familiar, in, russia, in, italy, france, and, germany, it, was, said, that, a, man, or, woman, could, turn, into, a, werewolf, if, he, or, she, on, a, certain, wednesday, or, friday, slept, outside, on, a, summer, night, with, the, full, moon, shining, directly, on, his, or, her, face, in, other, cases, the, transformation, was, supposedly, accomplished, by, satanic, allegiance, for, the, most, loathsome, ends, often, for, the, sake, of, sating, a, craving, for, human, flesh, the, werewolves, writes, richard, verstegan, restitution, of, decayed, intelligence, 1628, are, certayne, sorcerers, who, having, annoynted, their, bodies, with, an, ointment, which, they, make, by, the, instinct, of, the, devil, and, putting, on, a, certayne, inchaunted, girdle, does, not, only, unto, the, view, of, others, seem, as, wolves, but, to, their, own, thinking, have, both, the, shape, and, nature, of, wolves, so, long, as, they, wear, the, said, girdle, and, they, do, dispose, themselves, as, very, wolves, in, worrying, and, killing, and, most, of, humane, creatures, the, phenomenon, of, repercussion, the, power, of, animal, metamorphosis, or, of, sending, out, a, familiar, real, or, spiritual, as, a, messenger, and, the, supernormal, powers, conferred, by, association, with, such, a, familiar, are, also, attributed, to, the, magician, male, and, female, all, the, world, over, and, witch, superstitions, are, closely, parallel, to, if, not, identical, with, lycanthropic, beliefs, the, occasional, involuntary, character, of, lycanthropy, being, almost, the, sole, distinguishing, feature, in, another, direction, the, phenomenon, of, repercussion, is, asserted, to, manifest, itself, in, connection, with, the, bush, soul, of, the, west, african, and, the, nagual, of, central, america, but, though, there, is, no, line, of, demarcation, to, be, drawn, on, logical, grounds, the, assumed, power, of, the, magician, and, the, intimate, association, of, the, bush, soul, or, the, nagual, with, a, human, being, are, not, termed, lycanthropy, the, curse, of, lycanthropy, was, also, considered, by, some, scholars, as, being, a, divine, punishment, werewolf, literature, shows, many, examples, of, god, or, saints, allegedly, cursing, those, who, invoked, their, wrath, with, lycanthropy, such, is, the, case, of, lycaon, who, was, turned, into, a, wolf, by, zeus, as, punishment, for, slaughtering, one, of, his, own, sons, and, serving, his, remains, to, the, gods, as, a, dinner, those, who, were, excommunicated, by, the, roman, catholic, church, were, also, said, to, become, werewolves, the, power, of, transforming, others, into, wild, beasts, was, attributed, not, only, to, malignant, sorcerers, but, to, christian, saints, as, well, omnes, angeli, boni, et, mali, ex, virtute, naturali, habent, potestatem, transmutandi, corpora, nostra, all, angels, good, and, bad, have, the, power, of, transmutating, our, bodies, was, the, dictum, of, st, thomas, aquinas, st, patrick, was, said, to, have, transformed, the, welsh, king, vereticus, into, a, wolf, natalis, supposedly, cursed, an, illustrious, irish, family, whose, members, were, each, doomed, to, be, a, wolf, for, seven, years, in, other, tales, the, divine, agency, is, even, more, direct, while, in, russia, again, men, supposedly, became, werewolves, when, incurring, the, wrath, of, the, devil, a, notable, exception, to, the, association, of, lycanthropy, and, the, devil, comes, from, a, rare, and, lesser, known, account, of, an, 80, year, old, man, named, thiess, in, 1692, in, j, rgensburg, livonia, thiess, testified, under, oath, that, he, and, other, werewolves, were, the, hounds, of, god, he, claimed, they, were, warriors, who, descended, into, hell, to, battle, witches, and, demons, their, efforts, ensured, that, the, devil, and, his, minions, did, not, carry, off, the, grain, from, local, failed, crops, down, to, hell, thiess, was, ultimately, sentenced, to, ten, lashes, for, idolatry, and, superstitious, belief, various, methods, have, existed, for, removing, the, werewolf, form, in, antiquity, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, believed, in, the, power, of, exhaustion, in, curing, people, of, lycanthropy, the, victim, would, be, subjected, to, long, periods, of, physical, activity, in, the, hope, of, being, purged, of, the, malady, this, practice, stemmed, from, the, fact, that, many, alleged, werewolves, would, be, left, feeling, weak, and, debilitated, after, committing, depredations, in, medieval, europe, traditionally, there, are, three, methods, one, can, use, to, cure, a, victim, of, lycanthropy, medicinally, usually, via, the, use, of, wolfsbane, surgically, or, by, exorcism, many, of, the, cures, advocated, by, medieval, medical, practitioners, proved, fatal, to, the, patients, a, sicilian, belief, of, arabic, origin, holds, that, a, werewolf, can, be, cured, of, its, ailment, by, striking, it, on, the, forehead, or, scalp, with, a, knife, another, belief, from, the, same, culture, involves, the, piercing, of, the, werewolf, s, hands, with, nails, sometimes, less, extreme, methods, were, used, in, the, german, lowland, of, schleswig, holstein, a, werewolf, could, be, cured, if, one, were, to, simply, address, it, three, times, by, its, christian, name, one, danish, belief, holds, that, merely, scolding, a, werewolf, will, cure, it, conversion, to, christianity, was, a, common, method, of, removing, lycanthropy, in, the, medieval, period, a, devotion, to, st, hubert, has, been, cited, as, both, cure, for, and, protection, from, lycanthropes, before, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, greeks, believed, that, the, corpses, of, werewolves, if, not, destroyed, would, return, to, life, in, the, form, of, wolves, or, hyenas, that, prowled, battlefields, drinking, the, blood, of, dying, soldiers, in, the, same, vein, in, some, rural, areas, of, germany, poland, and, northern, france, it, was, once, believed, that, people, who, died, in, mortal, sin, came, back, to, life, as, blood, drinking, wolves, these, undead, werewolves, would, return, to, their, human, corpse, form, at, daylight, they, were, dealt, with, by, decapitation, with, a, spade, and, exorcism, by, the, parish, priest, the, head, would, then, be, thrown, into, a, stream, where, the, weight, of, its, sins, was, thought, to, weigh, it, down, sometimes, the, same, methods, used, to, dispose, of, ordinary, vampires, would, be, used, the, vampire, was, linked, to, the, werewolf, in, east, european, countries, particularly, bulgaria, serbia, and, slovenia, in, serbia, the, werewolf, and, vampire, are, known, collectively, as, vulkodlak, in, hungarian, folklore, werewolves, are, said, to, live, in, the, region, of, transdanubia, and, it, was, thought, that, the, ability, to, change, into, a, wolf, was, obtained, in, infancy, after, suffering, parental, abuse, or, by, a, curse, it, is, told, that, at, the, age, of, seven, the, boy, or, the, girl, leave, home, at, night, to, go, hunting, and, can, change, to, a, person, or, wolf, whenever, they, want, the, curse, can, also, be, obtained, in, adulthood, if, a, person, passes, three, times, through, an, arch, made, of, birch, with, the, help, of, a, wild, rose, s, spine, the, werewolves, were, known, to, exterminate, all, kind, of, farm, animals, especially, sheep, the, transformation, usually, occurred, during, the, winter, solstice, easter, and, a, full, moon, later, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, the, trials, in, hungary, were, not, only, conducted, against, witches, but, against, werewolves, too, and, many, records, exist, documenting, connections, between, the, two, vampires, and, werewolves, are, closely, related, in, hungarian, folklore, both, being, feared, in, antiquity, among, the, south, slavs, and, among, the, ethnic, kashubian, people, in, present, day, northern, poland, there, was, the, belief, that, if, a, child, was, born, with, hair, a, birthmark, or, a, caul, on, their, head, they, were, supposed, to, possess, shape, shifting, abilities, though, capable, of, turning, into, any, animal, they, wished, it, was, commonly, believed, that, such, people, preferred, to, turn, into, a, wolf, serbian, vukodlak, s, traditionally, had, the, habit, of, congregating, annually, in, the, winter, months, when, they, would, strip, off, their, wolf, skins, and, hang, them, from, trees, they, would, then, get, a, hold, of, another, vulkodlak, s, skin, and, burn, it, releasing, from, its, curse, the, vukodlak, from, whom, the, skin, came, according, to, armenian, lore, there, are, women, who, in, consequence, of, deadly, sins, are, condemned, to, spend, seven, years, in, wolf, form, in, a, typical, account, a, condemned, woman, is, visited, by, a, wolfskin, toting, spirit, who, orders, her, to, wear, the, skin, which, causes, her, to, acquire, frightful, cravings, for, human, flesh, soon, after, with, her, better, nature, overcome, the, she, wolf, devours, each, of, her, own, children, then, her, relatives, children, in, order, of, relationship, and, finally, the, children, of, strangers, she, wanders, only, at, night, with, doors, and, locks, springing, open, at, her, approach, when, morning, arrives, she, reverts, to, human, form, and, removes, her, wolfskin, the, transformation, is, generally, said, to, be, involuntary, there, are, alternate, versions, involving, voluntary, metamorphosis, where, the, women, can, transform, at, will, the, naskapis, believed, that, the, caribou, afterlife, is, guarded, by, giant, wolves, that, kill, careless, hunters, venturing, too, near, the, navajo, people, feared, witches, in, wolf, s, clothing, called, mai, cob, woodward, thought, that, these, beliefs, were, due, to, the, norse, colonization, of, the, americas, when, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, occurred, the, pioneers, brought, their, own, werewolf, folklore, with, them, and, were, later, influenced, by, the, lore, of, their, neighbouring, colonies, and, those, of, the, natives, belief, in, the, loup, garou, present, in, canada, the, upper, and, lower, peninsulas, of, michigan, and, upstate, new, york, originates, from, french, folklore, influenced, by, native, american, stories, on, the, wendigo, in, mexico, there, is, a, belief, in, a, creature, called, the, nagual, in, haiti, there, is, a, superstition, that, werewolf, spirits, known, locally, as, j, rouge, red, eyes, can, possess, the, bodies, of, unwitting, persons, and, nightly, transform, them, into, cannibalistic, lupine, creatures, the, haitian, j, rouges, typically, try, to, trick, mothers, into, giving, away, their, children, voluntarily, by, waking, them, at, night, and, asking, their, permission, to, take, their, child, to, which, the, disoriented, mother, may, either, reply, yes, or, no, the, haitian, j, rouges, differ, from, traditional, european, werewolves, by, their, habit, of, actively, trying, to, spread, their, lycanthropic, condition, to, others, much, like, vampires, most, modern, fiction, describes, werewolves, as, vulnerable, to, silver, weapons, and, highly, resistant, to, other, injuries, this, feature, appears, in, german, folklore, of, the, 19th, century, the, claim, that, the, beast, of, g, vaudan, an, 18th, century, wolf, or, wolflike, creature, was, shot, by, a, silver, bullet, appears, to, have, been, introduced, by, novelists, retelling, the, story, from, 1935, onwards, and, not, in, earlier, versions, english, folklore, prior, to, 1865, showed, shapeshifters, to, be, vulnerable, to, silver, till, the, publican, shot, a, silver, button, over, their, heads, when, they, were, instantly, transformed, into, two, ill, favoured, old, ladies, c, 1640, the, city, of, greifswald, germany, was, infested, by, werewolves, a, clever, lad, suggested, that, they, gather, all, their, silver, buttons, goblets, belt, buckles, and, so, forth, and, melt, them, down, into, bullets, for, their, muskets, and, pistols, this, time, they, slaughtered, the, creatures, and, rid, greifswald, of, the, lycanthropes, the, 1897, novel, dracula, and, the, short, story, dracula, s, guest, both, written, by, bram, stoker, drew, on, earlier, mythologies, of, werewolves, and, similar, legendary, demons, and, was, to, voice, the, anxieties, of, an, age, and, the, fears, of, late, victorian, patriarchy, in, dracula, s, guest, a, band, of, military, horsemen, coming, to, the, aid, of, the, protagonist, chase, off, dracula, depicted, as, a, great, wolf, stating, the, only, way, to, kill, it, is, by, a, sacred, bullet, this, is, also, mentioned, in, the, main, novel, dracula, as, well, count, dracula, stated, in, the, novel, that, legends, of, werewolves, originated, from, his, szekely, racial, bloodline, who, himself, is, also, depicted, with, the, ability, to, shapeshift, into, a, wolf, at, will, during, the, night, but, is, unable, to, do, so, during, the, day, except, at, noon, the, 1928, novel, the, wolf, s, bride, a, tale, from, estonia, written, by, the, finnish, author, aino, kallas, tells, story, of, the, forester, priidik, s, wife, aalo, living, in, hiiumaa, in, the, 17th, century, who, became, a, werewolf, under, the, influence, of, a, malevolent, forest, spirit, also, known, as, diabolus, sylvarum, the, first, feature, film, to, use, an, anthropomorphic, werewolf, was, werewolf, of, london, in, 1935, the, main, werewolf, of, this, film, is, a, dapper, london, scientist, who, retains, some, of, his, style, and, most, of, his, human, features, after, his, transformation, as, lead, actor, henry, hull, was, unwilling, to, spend, long, hours, being, made, up, by, makeup, artist, jack, pierce, universal, studios, drew, on, a, balkan, tale, of, a, plant, associated, with, lycanthropy, as, there, was, no, literary, work, to, draw, upon, unlike, the, case, with, vampires, there, is, no, reference, to, silver, nor, other, aspects, of, werewolf, lore, such, as, cannibalism, a, more, tragic, character, is, lawrence, talbot, played, by, lon, chaney, jr, in, 1941, s, the, wolf, man, with, pierce, s, makeup, more, elaborate, this, time, the, movie, catapulted, the, werewolf, into, public, consciousness, sympathetic, portrayals, are, few, but, notable, such, as, the, comedic, but, tortured, protagonist, david, naughton, in, an, american, werewolf, in, london, and, a, less, anguished, and, more, confident, and, charismatic, jack, nicholson, in, the, 1994, film, wolf, over, time, the, depiction, of, werewolves, has, gone, from, fully, malevolent, to, even, heroic, creatures, such, as, in, the, underworld, and, twilight, series, as, well, as, blood, lad, dance, in, the, vampire, bund, rosario, vampire, and, various, other, movies, anime, manga, and, comic, books, other, werewolves, are, decidedly, more, willful, and, malevolent, such, as, those, in, the, novel, the, howling, and, its, subsequent, sequels, and, film, adaptations, the, form, a, werewolf, assumes, was, generally, anthropomorphic, in, early, films, such, as, the, wolf, man, and, werewolf, of, london, but, a, larger, and, powerful, wolf, in, many, later, films, werewolves, are, often, depicted, as, immune, to, damage, caused, by, ordinary, weapons, being, vulnerable, only, to, silver, objects, such, as, a, silver, tipped, cane, bullet, or, blade, this, attribute, was, first, adopted, cinematically, in, the, wolf, man, this, negative, reaction, to, silver, is, sometimes, so, strong, that, the, mere, touch, of, the, metal, on, a, werewolf, s, skin, will, cause, burns, current, day, werewolf, fiction, almost, exclusively, involves, lycanthropy, being, either, a, hereditary, condition, or, transmitted, like, an, infectious, disease, by, the, bite, of, another, werewolf, in, some, fiction, the, power, of, the, werewolf, extends, to, human, form, such, as, invulnerability, to, conventional, injury, due, to, their, healing, factor, superhuman, speed, and, strength, and, falling, on, their, feet, from, high, falls, aggressiveness, and, animalistic, urges, may, be, intensified, and, more, difficult, to, control, such, as, hunger, and, sexual, arousal, usually, in, these, cases, the, abilities, are, diminished, in, human, form, in, other, fiction, it, can, be, cured, by, medicine, men, or, antidotes, along, with, the, vulnerability, to, the, silver, bullet, the, full, moon, being, the, cause, of, the, transformation, only, became, part, of, the, depiction, of, werewolves, on, a, widespread, basis, in, the, twentieth, century, the, first, movie, to, feature, the, transformative, effect, of, the, full, moon, was, frankenstein, meets, the, wolf, man, in, 1943, werewolves, are, typically, envisioned, as, working, class, monsters, often, being, low, in, socio, economic, status, although, they, can, represent, a, variety, of, social, classes, and, at, times, were, seen, as, a, way, of, representing, aristocratic, decadence, during, 19th, century, horror, literature, nazi, germany, used, werwolf, as, the, mythical, creature, s, name, is,
