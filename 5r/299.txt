groups, the, nanchon, nations, most, notably, the, rada, and, the, petwo, about, whom, various, myths, and, stories, are, told, this, theology, has, been, labelled, both, monotheistic, and, polytheistic, an, initiatory, tradition, vodouists, commonly, venerate, the, lwa, at, an, ounf, temple, run, by, an, oungan, priest, or, manbo, priestess, alternatively, vodou, is, also, practised, within, family, groups, or, in, secret, societies, like, the, bizango, a, central, ritual, involves, practitioners, drumming, singing, and, dancing, to, encourage, a, lwa, to, possess, one, of, their, members, and, thus, communicate, with, them, offerings, to, the, lwa, and, to, spirits, of, the, dead, include, fruit, liquor, and, sacrificed, animals, several, forms, of, divination, are, utilized, to, decipher, messages, from, the, lwa, healing, rituals, and, the, preparation, of, herbal, remedies, and, talismans, also, play, a, prominent, role, vodou, developed, among, afro, haitian, communities, amid, the, atlantic, slave, trade, of, the, 16th, to, 19th, centuries, its, structure, arose, from, the, blending, of, the, traditional, religions, of, those, enslaved, west, and, central, africans, brought, to, the, island, of, hispaniola, among, them, kongo, fon, and, yoruba, there, it, absorbed, influences, from, the, culture, of, the, french, colonialists, who, controlled, the, colony, of, saint, domingue, most, notably, roman, catholicism, but, also, freemasonry, many, vodouists, were, involved, in, the, haitian, revolution, of, 1791, to, 1801, which, overthrew, the, french, colonial, government, abolished, slavery, and, transformed, saint, domingue, into, the, republic, of, haiti, the, roman, catholic, church, left, for, several, decades, following, the, revolution, allowing, vodou, to, become, haiti, s, dominant, religion, in, the, 20th, century, growing, emigration, spread, vodou, abroad, the, late, 20th, century, saw, growing, links, between, vodou, and, related, traditions, in, west, africa, and, the, americas, such, as, cuban, santer, a, and, brazilian, candombl, while, some, practitioners, influenced, by, the, n, gritude, movement, have, sought, to, remove, roman, catholic, influences, most, haitians, practice, both, vodou, and, roman, catholicism, seeing, no, contradiction, in, pursuing, the, two, different, systems, simultaneously, smaller, vodouist, communities, exist, elsewhere, especially, among, haitian, diasporas, in, cuba, and, the, united, states, both, in, haiti, and, abroad, vodou, has, spread, beyond, its, afro, haitian, origins, and, is, practiced, by, individuals, of, various, ethnicities, having, faced, much, criticism, through, its, history, vodou, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, world, s, most, misunderstood, religions, vodou, is, a, religion, more, specifically, scholars, have, characterised, it, as, an, afro, haitian, religion, and, as, haiti, s, national, religion, its, main, structure, derives, from, the, african, traditional, religions, of, west, and, central, africa, which, were, brought, to, haiti, by, enslaved, africans, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, of, these, the, greatest, influences, came, from, the, fon, and, bakongo, peoples, on, the, island, these, african, religions, mixed, with, the, iconography, of, european, derived, traditions, such, as, roman, catholicism, and, freemasonry, taking, the, form, of, vodou, around, the, mid, 18th, century, in, combining, varied, influences, vodou, has, often, been, described, as, syncretic, or, a, symbiosis, a, religion, exhibiting, diverse, cultural, influences, as, formed, in, haiti, vodou, represented, a, new, religion, a, creolized, new, world, system, one, that, differs, in, many, ways, from, african, traditional, religions, the, scholar, leslie, desmangles, therefore, called, it, an, african, derived, tradition, ina, j, fandrich, termed, it, a, neo, african, religion, and, markel, thylefors, called, it, an, afro, latin, american, religion, several, other, african, diasporic, religions, found, in, the, americas, formed, in, a, similar, way, and, owing, to, their, shared, origins, in, west, african, traditional, religion, vodou, has, been, characterized, as, a, sister, religion, of, cuban, santer, a, and, brazilian, candombl, vodou, has, no, central, institutional, authority, no, single, leader, and, no, developed, body, of, doctrine, it, thus, has, no, orthodoxy, no, central, liturgy, and, no, formal, creed, developing, over, the, course, of, several, centuries, it, has, changed, over, time, it, displays, variation, at, both, the, regional, and, local, level, including, variation, between, haiti, and, the, haitian, diaspora, as, well, as, among, different, congregations, it, is, practiced, domestically, by, families, on, their, land, but, also, by, congregations, meeting, communally, with, the, latter, termed, temple, vodou, in, haitian, culture, religions, are, not, generally, deemed, totally, autonomous, many, haitians, thus, practice, both, vodou, and, roman, catholicism, with, vodouists, usually, regarding, themselves, as, roman, catholics, in, haiti, vodouists, have, also, practiced, protestantism, mormonism, or, freemasonry, in, cuba, they, have, involved, themselves, in, santer, a, and, in, the, united, states, with, modern, paganism, vodou, has, also, absorbed, elements, from, other, contexts, in, cuba, some, vodouists, have, adopted, elements, from, spiritism, influenced, by, the, n, gritude, movement, other, vodouists, have, sought, to, remove, roman, catholic, and, other, european, influences, from, their, practice, of, vodou, in, english, vodou, s, practitioners, are, termed, vodouists, in, french, and, haitian, creole, they, are, called, vodouisants, or, vodouyizan, another, term, for, adherents, is, s, vit, serviteurs, devotees, reflecting, their, self, description, as, people, who, s, vi, lwa, serve, the, lwa, the, supernatural, beings, that, play, a, central, role, in, vodou, many, words, used, in, the, religion, derive, from, the, fon, language, of, west, africa, this, includes, the, word, vodou, itself, first, recorded, in, the, 1658, doctrina, christiana, the, fon, word, v, doun, was, used, in, the, west, african, kingdom, of, dahomey, to, signify, a, spirit, or, deity, in, haitian, creole, vodou, came, to, designate, a, specific, style, of, dance, and, drumming, before, outsiders, to, the, religion, adopted, it, as, a, generic, term, for, much, afro, haitian, religion, the, word, vodou, now, encompasses, a, variety, of, haiti, s, african, derived, religious, traditions, and, practices, incorporating, a, bundle, of, practices, that, practitioners, themselves, do, not, aggregate, vodou, is, thus, a, term, primarily, used, by, scholars, and, outsiders, to, the, religion, many, practitioners, describe, their, belief, system, with, the, term, ginen, which, especially, denotes, a, moral, philosophy, and, ethical, code, regarding, how, to, live, and, to, serve, the, spirits, vodou, is, the, common, spelling, for, the, religion, among, scholars, in, official, haitian, creole, orthography, and, by, the, united, states, library, of, congress, some, scholars, prefer, the, spellings, vodoun, voudoun, or, vodun, while, in, french, the, spellings, vaudou, or, vaudoux, also, appear, the, spelling, voodoo, once, common, is, now, generally, avoided, by, practitioners, and, scholars, when, referring, to, the, haitian, religion, this, is, both, to, avoid, confusion, with, louisiana, voodoo, a, related, but, distinct, tradition, and, to, distinguish, it, from, the, negative, connotations, that, the, term, voodoo, has, in, western, popular, culture, vodou, is, monotheistic, teaching, the, existence, of, a, single, supreme, god, this, entity, is, called, bondye, or, boni, a, name, deriving, from, the, french, term, bon, dieu, good, god, another, term, for, it, is, the, gran, m, t, borrowed, from, freemasonry, for, vodouists, bondye, is, the, ultimate, source, of, power, the, creator, of, the, universe, and, the, maintainer, of, cosmic, order, haitians, frequently, use, the, phrase, si, bondye, vle, if, bondye, wishes, suggesting, a, belief, that, all, things, occur, in, accordance, with, this, divinity, s, will, vodouists, regard, bondye, as, being, transcendent, and, remote, as, the, god, is, uninvolved, in, human, affairs, they, see, little, point, in, approaching, it, directly, while, vodouists, often, equate, bondye, with, the, christian, god, vodou, does, not, incorporate, belief, in, a, powerful, antagonist, that, opposes, the, supreme, being, akin, to, the, christian, notion, of, satan, vodou, has, also, been, characterized, as, polytheistic, it, teaches, the, existence, of, beings, called, the, lwa, a, term, varyingly, translated, into, english, as, spirits, gods, or, geniuses, these, lwa, are, also, known, as, the, myst, res, anges, saints, and, les, invisibles, and, are, sometimes, equated, with, the, angels, of, christian, cosmology, vodou, teaches, that, there, are, over, a, thousand, lwa, serving, as, bondye, s, intermediaries, they, communicate, with, humans, through, their, dreams, or, by, directly, possessing, them, vodouists, believe, the, lwa, are, capable, of, offering, people, help, protection, and, counsel, in, return, for, ritual, service, each, lwa, has, its, own, personality, and, is, associated, with, specific, colors, days, of, the, week, and, objects, they, are, however, not, seen, as, moral, exemplars, for, practitioners, to, imitate, the, lwa, can, be, either, loyal, or, capricious, in, their, dealings, with, their, devotees, they, are, easily, offended, for, instance, if, offered, food, they, dislike, when, angered, the, lwa, are, believed, to, remove, their, protection, from, their, devotees, or, to, inflict, misfortune, illness, or, madness, on, an, individual, although, there, are, exceptions, most, lwa, names, derive, from, the, fon, and, yoruba, languages, new, lwa, are, nevertheless, added, to, the, pantheon, with, both, talismans, and, certain, humans, thought, capable, of, becoming, lwa, in, the, latter, case, through, their, strength, of, personality, or, power, vodouists, often, refer, to, the, lwa, living, in, the, sea, or, in, rivers, or, alternatively, in, guinea, a, term, encompassing, a, generalized, understanding, of, africa, as, the, ancestral, land, of, the, haitian, people, the, lwa, divide, into, nanchon, or, nations, this, classificatory, system, derives, from, the, way, in, which, enslaved, africans, were, divided, into, nations, upon, their, arrival, in, haiti, usually, based, on, their, african, port, of, departure, rather, than, their, ethno, cultural, identity, the, term, fanmi, family, is, sometimes, used, synonymously, with, nanchon, or, alternatively, as, a, sub, division, of, the, latter, category, it, is, often, claimed, that, there, are, 17, nanchon, of, which, the, rada, and, the, petwo, are, the, largest, and, most, dominant, the, rada, lwa, are, seen, as, being, cool, the, petwo, lwa, as, hot, this, means, that, the, rada, are, dous, or, doux, or, sweet, tempered, while, the, petwo, are, lwa, cho, indicating, that, they, can, be, forceful, or, violent, and, are, associated, with, fire, whereas, the, rada, are, generally, righteous, their, petwo, counterparts, are, more, morally, ambiguous, and, associated, with, issues, like, money, the, rada, owe, more, to, dahomeyan, and, yoruba, influences, their, name, probably, comes, from, arada, a, city, in, the, dahomey, kingdom, of, west, africa, the, petwo, derive, largely, from, kongo, religion, although, also, exhibit, dahomeyan, and, creolised, influences, some, lwa, exist, andezo, or, en, deux, eaux, meaning, that, they, are, in, two, waters, and, are, served, in, both, rada, and, petwo, rituals, vodou, teaches, that, there, are, over, a, thousand, lwa, although, certain, ones, are, especially, widely, venerated, in, rada, ceremonies, the, first, lwa, saluted, is, papa, legba, also, known, as, legba, depicted, as, a, feeble, old, man, wearing, rags, and, using, a, crutch, papa, legba, is, the, protector, of, gates, and, fences, and, thus, of, the, home, as, well, as, of, roads, paths, and,

desmangles, have, argued, that, vodouists, originally, adopted, the, roman, catholic, saints, to, conceal, lwa, worship, when, the, latter, was, illegal, during, the, colonial, period, observing, vodou, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, donald, j, cosentino, argued, that, by, that, point, the, use, of, roman, catholic, saints, reflected, the, genuine, devotional, expression, of, many, vodouists, the, scholar, marc, a, christophe, concurred, stating, that, most, modern, vodouists, genuinely, see, the, saints, and, lwa, as, one, reflecting, vodou, s, all, inclusive, and, harmonizing, characteristics, many, vodouists, possess, chromolithographic, prints, of, the, saints, while, images, of, these, christian, figures, can, also, be, found, on, temple, walls, and, on, the, drapo, flags, used, in, vodou, ritual, vodouists, also, often, adopt, and, reinterpret, biblical, stories, and, theorise, about, the, nature, of, jesus, of, nazareth, vodou, holds, that, bondye, created, humanity, in, its, image, fashioning, humans, from, water, and, clay, it, teaches, the, existence, of, a, soul, usually, called, the, nanm, or, sometimes, the, espri, which, is, divided, in, two, parts, one, of, these, is, the, ti, bonnanj, little, good, angel, understood, as, the, conscience, that, allows, an, individual, to, engage, in, self, reflection, and, self, criticism, the, other, part, is, the, gwo, bonnanj, big, good, angel, and, this, constitutes, the, psyche, source, of, memory, intelligence, and, personhood, both, parts, are, believed, to, reside, within, an, individual, s, head, although, the, gwo, bonnanj, is, thought, capable, of, leaving, the, head, and, travelling, while, a, person, sleeps, vodouists, believe, that, every, individual, is, connected, to, a, specific, lwa, regarded, as, their, m, t, t, t, master, of, the, head, they, believe, that, this, lwa, informs, the, individual, s, personality, vodou, holds, that, the, identity, of, a, person, s, tutelary, lwa, can, be, identified, through, divination, or, by, consulting, lwa, when, they, possess, other, humans, some, of, the, religion, s, priests, and, priestesses, are, deemed, to, have, the, gift, of, eyes, capable, of, seeing, the, identity, of, a, person, s, tutelary, lwa, vodou, holds, that, bondye, has, preordained, the, time, of, everyone, s, death, but, does, not, teach, the, existence, of, an, afterlife, realm, akin, to, the, christian, ideas, of, heaven, and, hell, instead, a, common, belief, is, that, at, bodily, death, the, gwo, bonnanj, join, the, ginen, or, ancestral, spirits, while, the, ti, bonnanj, proceeds, to, face, judgement, before, bondye, this, idea, of, judgement, is, more, common, in, urban, areas, having, been, influenced, by, roman, catholicism, while, in, the, haitian, mountains, it, is, more, common, for, vodouists, to, believe, that, the, ti, bonnanj, dissolves, into, the, navel, of, the, earth, nine, days, after, death, the, land, of, the, ginen, is, often, identified, as, being, located, beneath, the, sea, under, the, earth, or, above, the, sky, some, vodouists, believe, that, the, gwo, bonnanj, stays, in, the, land, of, the, ginen, for, a, year, and, a, day, before, being, absorbed, into, the, gede, family, however, vodouists, usually, distinguish, the, spirits, of, the, dead, from, the, gede, proper, for, the, latter, are, lwa, vodou, also, teaches, that, the, dead, continue, to, participate, in, human, affairs, with, these, spirits, often, complaining, that, they, suffer, from, hunger, cold, and, damp, and, thus, requiring, sacrifices, from, the, living, vodou, ethical, standards, correspond, to, its, sense, of, cosmological, order, with, a, belief, in, the, interdependence, of, things, playing, a, role, in, vodou, approaches, to, ethical, issues, serving, the, lwa, is, central, to, vodou, and, its, moral, codes, reflect, the, reciprocal, relationship, that, practitioners, have, with, these, spirits, for, vodouists, virtue, is, maintained, by, ensuring, a, responsible, relationship, with, the, lwa, vodou, also, promotes, a, belief, in, destiny, although, individuals, are, still, deemed, to, have, freedom, of, choice, this, view, of, destiny, has, been, interpreted, as, encouraging, a, fatalistic, outlook, something, that, the, religion, s, critics, especially, from, christian, backgrounds, have, argued, has, discouraged, vodouists, from, improving, their, society, this, has, been, extended, into, an, argument, that, vodou, is, responsible, for, haiti, s, poverty, a, view, that, in, turn, has, been, accused, of, being, rooted, in, european, colonial, prejudices, towards, africans, although, vodou, permeates, every, aspect, of, its, adherent, s, lives, it, offers, no, prescriptive, code, of, ethics, rather, than, being, rule, based, vodou, morality, is, deemed, contextual, to, the, situation, with, no, clear, binary, division, between, good, and, evil, vodou, reflects, people, s, everyday, concerns, focusing, on, techniques, for, mitigating, illness, and, misfortune, doing, what, one, needs, to, in, order, to, survive, is, considered, a, high, ethic, among, vodouists, a, moral, person, is, regarded, as, someone, who, lives, in, tune, with, their, character, and, that, of, their, tutelary, lwa, in, general, acts, that, reinforce, bondye, s, power, are, deemed, good, those, that, undermine, it, are, seen, as, bad, maji, meaning, the, use, of, supernatural, powers, for, self, serving, and, malevolent, ends, are, usually, thought, bad, the, term, is, quite, flexible, it, is, usually, used, to, denigrate, other, vodouists, although, some, practitioners, have, used, it, as, a, self, descriptor, in, reference, to, petwo, rites, the, extended, family, is, of, importance, in, haitian, society, with, vodou, reinforcing, family, ties, and, emphasising, respect, for, the, elderly, although, there, are, accounts, of, male, vodou, priests, mistreating, their, female, followers, in, the, religion, women, can, also, lay, claim, to, moral, authority, as, social, and, spiritual, leaders, vodou, is, also, considered, sympathetic, to, gay, people, with, many, gay, and, bisexual, individuals, holding, status, as, vodou, priests, and, priestesses, and, some, groups, having, largely, gay, congregations, some, vodouists, state, that, the, lwa, determined, their, sexual, orientation, turning, them, homosexual, while, the, lwa, zili, is, seen, as, the, patron, of, masisi, gay, men, the, anthropologist, alfred, m, traux, described, vodou, as, a, practical, and, utilitarian, religion, its, practices, largely, revolve, around, interactions, with, the, lwa, and, incorporate, song, drumming, dance, prayer, possession, and, animal, sacrifice, practitioners, gather, together, for, s, vices, services, in, which, they, commune, with, the, lwa, ceremonies, for, a, particular, lwa, often, coincide, with, the, feast, day, of, the, roman, catholic, saint, which, that, lwa, is, associated, with, the, mastery, of, ritual, forms, is, considered, imperative, in, vodou, the, purpose, of, ritual, is, to, echofe, heat, things, up, thus, bringing, about, change, whether, that, be, to, remove, barriers, or, to, facilitate, healing, secrecy, is, important, in, vodou, it, is, an, initiatory, tradition, operating, through, a, system, of, graded, induction, or, initiation, when, an, individual, agrees, to, serve, a, lwa, it, is, deemed, a, lifelong, commitment, vodou, has, a, strong, oral, culture, and, its, teachings, are, primarily, disseminated, through, oral, transmission, although, many, practitioners, began, to, use, texts, after, they, appeared, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, terminology, used, in, vodou, ritual, is, called, langaj, unlike, in, santer, a, and, candombl, which, employ, yoruba, as, a, liturgical, language, not, understood, by, most, practitioners, in, vodou, the, liturgies, are, predominantly, in, haitian, creole, the, everyday, language, of, most, vodouists, male, priests, are, referred, to, as, an, oungan, alternatively, spelled, houngan, or, hungan, or, a, pr, t, vodou, vodou, priest, priestesses, are, termed, manbo, alternatively, spelled, mambo, oungan, numerically, dominate, in, rural, haiti, while, there, is, a, more, equitable, balance, of, priests, and, priestesses, in, urban, areas, the, oungan, and, manbo, are, tasked, with, organising, liturgies, preparing, initiations, offering, consultations, with, clients, using, divination, and, preparing, remedies, for, the, sick, there, is, no, priestly, hierarchy, with, oungan, and, manbo, being, largely, self, sufficient, in, many, cases, the, role, is, hereditary, historical, evidence, suggests, that, the, role, of, the, oungan, and, manbo, intensified, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, as, a, result, temple, vodou, is, now, more, common, in, rural, areas, of, haiti, than, it, was, in, historical, periods, vodou, teaches, that, the, lwa, call, an, individual, to, become, an, oungan, or, manbo, and, if, the, latter, refuses, then, misfortune, may, befall, them, a, prospective, oungan, or, manbo, must, normally, rise, through, the, other, roles, in, a, vodou, congregation, before, undergoing, an, apprenticeship, with, a, pre, existing, oungan, or, manbo, lasting, several, months, or, years, after, this, apprenticeship, they, undergo, an, initiation, ceremony, the, details, of, which, are, kept, secret, from, non, initiates, other, oungan, and, manbo, do, not, undergo,

invoke, a, lwa, into, a, pitcher, where, it, will, then, be, asked, questions, other, forms, of, divination, used, by, vodouists, include, the, casting, of, shells, cartomancy, studying, leaves, coffee, grounds, or, cinders, in, a, glass, or, looking, into, a, candle, flame, a, form, of, divination, associated, especially, with, petwo, lwa, is, the, use, of, a, gembo, shell, sometimes, with, a, mirror, attached, to, one, side, and, affixed, at, both, ends, to, string, the, string, is, twirled, and, the, directions, of, the, shell, used, to, interpret, the, responses, of, the, lwa, healing, plays, an, important, role, in, vodou, a, client, will, approach, a, manbo, or, oungan, complaining, of, illness, or, misfortune, and, the, latter, will, use, divination, to, determine, the, cause, and, select, a, remedy, manbo, and, oungan, typically, have, a, wide, knowledge, of, plants, and, their, medicinal, uses, when, collecting, plants, they, are, expected, to, show, them, respect, for, instance, by, leaving, coins, in, payment, for, removing, leaves, to, heal, vodou, specialists, often, prescribe, baths, consisting, of, water, infused, with, various, ingredients, or, produce, powders, for, a, specific, purpose, such, as, to, attract, good, luck, or, aid, seduction, alternatively, they, may, create, a, material, object, infused, with, spirits, or, medicines, a, wanga, although, these, can, also, be, devoted, to, harmful, purposes, manbo, and, oungan, often, provide, talismans, called, a, pwen, point, travay, work, travay, maji, magic, work, pak, t, or, pak, t,

assistance, from, medical, professionals, while, the, latter, may, also, send, their, patients, to, see, an, oungan, or, manbo, although, in, the, late, 20th, century, there, were, concerns, that, the, haitian, reliance, on, oungan, and, manbo, was, contributing, to, the, spread, of, hiv, aids, by, the, early, 21st, century, various, ngos, and, other, groups, were, working, on, bringing, vodou, officiants, into, the, broader, campaign, against, the, virus, in, haiti, there, are, also, dokt, f, y, herb, doctors, leaf, doctors, who, offer, herbal, remedies, for, ailments, but, deal, in, fewer,

suspicion, and, censure, toward, those, suspected, of, being, b, k, the, curses, of, the, b, k, are, believed, to, be, countered, by, the, oungan, and, manbo, who, can, revert, the, curse, through, an, exorcism, that, incorporates, invocations, of, protective, lwa, massages, and, baths, in, haiti, some, oungan, and, manbo, have, been, accused, of, working, with, a, b, k, arranging, for, the,

the, beny, who, gives, the, dead, person, messages, to, take, with, them, a, wake, the, veye, follows, the, body, is, then, buried, in, the, cemetery, often, according, to, roman, catholic, custom, in, northern, haiti, an, additional, rite, takes, place, at, the, ounf, on, the, day, of, the, funeral, the, kase, kanari, breaking, of, the, clay, pot, in, this, a, jar, is, washed, in, substances, including, kleren, placed, within, a, trench, dug, into, the, peristil, floor, and, smashed, the, trench, is, then, refilled, the, night, after, the, funeral, the, novena, takes, place, at, the, home, of, the, deceased, involving, roman, catholic, prayers, a, mass, for, them, is, held, a, year, after, death, vodouists, fear, the, dead, s, ability, to, harm, the, living, it, is, believed, that, the, deceased, may, for, instance, punish, their, living, relatives, if, the, latter, fail, to, appropriately, mourn, them, many, vodouists, believe, that, a, practitioner, s, spirit, dwells, in, the, land, of, ginen, located, at, the, bottom, of, a, lake, or, river, for, a, year, and, a, day, a, year, and, a, day, after, death, the, wete, m, nan, dlo, extracting, the, dead, from, the, waters, of, the, abyss, ritual, may, take, place, in, which, the, deceased, s, gwo, bonnanj, is, reclaimed, from, the, realm, of, the, dead, and, placed, into, a, clay, jar, or, bottle, called, the, govi, now, ensconced, in, the, world, of, the, living, the, gwo, bonnanj, of, this, ancestor, is, deemed, capable, of, assisting, its, descendants, and, guiding, them, with, its, wisdom, practitioners, sometimes, believe, that, failing, to, conduct, this, ritual, can, result, in, misfortune, illness, and, death, for, the, family, of, the, deceased, offerings, then, given, to, this, spirit, of, the, dead, are, termed, manje, m, the, notion, of, a, spirit, being, encased, in, a, vessel, and, then, used, for, workings, likely, derives, from, bakongo, influences, and, has, similarities, with, the, bakongo, derived, palo, religion, from, cuba, another, belief, about, the, dead, that, of, zonbis, is, one, of, the, most, sensationalized, aspects, of, haitian, religion, zonbi, are, often, regarded, as, the, gwo, bonnanj, of, the, recently, deceased, that, have, been, captured, and, forced, to, work, for, their, master, the, gwo, bonnanj, may, then, be, kept, inside, a, bottle, or, other, vessel, the, practice, is, often, linked, to, chanpw, l, secret, societies, which, are, suspected, of, murdering, the, individual, they, wish, to, turn, into, a, zonbi, to, achieve, this, they, may, obtain, the, bones, of, a, deceased, person, especially, their, skull, sometimes, by, bribing, cemetery, workers, the, skull, will, often, be, baptised, given, food, and, set, a, particular, task, to, specialise, in, such, as, healing, a, specific, malady, those, intending, to, take, a, gwo, bonnanj, as, a, zonbi, may, have, to, borrow, or, buy, them, from, baron, samedi, an, alternative, idea, in, haitian, lore, is, that, it, is, the, body, that, is, turned, into, a, zonbi, in, which, case, a, b, k, has, seized, an, individual, s, ti, bonnanj, and, left, the, body, as, an, empty, vessel, that, can, be, manipulated, the, reality, of, this, phenomenon, is, contested, although, the, anthropologist, wade, davis, argued, that, this, was, based, on, a, real, practice, whereby, bizango, societies, used, poisons, to, make, certain, individuals, more, pliant, haitians, generally, do, not, fear, zonbis, but, rather, fear, becoming, one, themselves, the, figure, of, the, zonbi, has, also, been, interpreted, as, a, metaphor, for, the, enslavement, central, to, haitian, history, on, the, saints, days, of, the, roman, catholic, calendar, vodouists, often, hold, birthday, parties, for, the, lwa, associated, with, the, saint, whose, day, it, is, these, are, marked, with, special, altars, for, the, celebrated, lwa, as, well, as, the, preparation, of, their, preferred, food, devotions, to, the, gede, are, particularly, common, around, the, days, of, the, dead, all, saints, 1, november, and, all, souls, 2, november, with, celebrations, largely, taking, place, in, the, cemeteries, of, port, au, prince, at, this, festival, those, devoted, to, the, gede, dress, in, black, and, purple, with, funeral, frock, coats, black, veils, and, top, hats, all, linking, to, the, gede, s, associations,

and, some, rara, leaders, claim, that, a, lwa, instructed, them, to, form, their, band, an, oungan, will, typically, be, part, of, the, rara, band, and, will, oversee, their, religious, obligations, for, instance, performing, rituals, during, their, procession, or, providing, members, with, a, benyen, protective, bath, before, they, perform, they, may, also, attempt, to, curse, or, poison, rival,

colony, on, hispaniola, a, growing, european, presence, decimated, the, island, s, indigenous, population, which, was, probably, ta, no, both, through, introduced, diseases, and, exploitation, as, laborers, the, european, colonists, then, turned, to, imported, west, african, slaves, as, a, new, source, of, labor, africans, first, arrived, on, hispaniola, circa, 1512, most, of, the, enslaved, were, prisoners, of, war, some, were, probably, priests, of, traditional, religions, helping, to, transport, their, rites, to, the, americas, others, were, probably, muslim, although, islam, exerted, little, influence, on, vodou, while, some, probably, practiced, traditional, religions, that, had, already, absorbed, roman, catholic, iconographic, influences, by, the, late, 16th, century, french, colonists, were, settling, in, western, hispaniola, spain, recognized, french, sovereignty, over, that, part, of, the, island, which, became, saint, domingue, in, a, series, of, treaties, signed, in, 1697, moving, away, from, its, previous, subsistence, economy, in, the, 18th, century, saint, domingue, refocused, its, economy, around, the, mass, export, of, indigo, coffee, sugar, and, cocoa, to, europe, to, work, the, plantations, the, french, colonists, placed, a, renewed, emphasis, on, importing, enslaved, africans, whereas, there, were, twice, as, many, africans, as, europeans, in, the, colony, in, 1681, by, 1790, there, were, eleven, times, as, many, africans, as, europeans, ultimately, saint, domingue, became, the, colony, with, the, largest, number, of, slaves, in, the, caribbean, roman, catholicism, was, the, official, religion, of, saint, domingue, the, code, noir, issued, by, king, louis, xiv, in, 1685, forbade, the, open, practice, of, african, religions, on, the, colony, this, code, compelled, slave, owners, to, have, their, slaves, baptised, and, instructed, as, roman, catholics, the, fact, that, the, process, of, enslavement, led, to, these, africans, becoming, christian, was, a, key, way, in, which, the, slave, owners, sought, to, morally, legitimate, their, actions, however, many, slave, owners, took, little, interest, in, having, their, slaves, instructed, in, roman, catholic, teaching, they, often, did, not, want, their, slaves, to, spend, time, celebrating, saints, days, rather, than, laboring, and, were, also, concerned, that, black, congregations, could, provide, scope, to, foment, revolt, enslavement, destroyed, the, social, fabric, of, african, traditional, religions, which, were, typically, rooted, in, ethnic, and, family, membership, although, certain, cultural, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, the, universe, would, have, been, widely, shared, among, the, enslaved, africans, they, came, from, diverse, linguistic, and, ethno, cultural, backgrounds, and, had, to, forge, common, cultural, practices, on, hispaniola, gradually, over, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, vodou, emerged, as, a, composite, of, various, african, ethnic, traditions, merging, diverse, practices, into, a, more, cohesive, form, african, religions, had, to, be, practiced, secretly, with, roman, catholic, iconography, and, rituals, probably, used, to, conceal, the, true, identity, of, the, deities, venerated, this, resulted, in, a, system, of, correspondences, between, african, spirits, and, roman, catholic, saints, afro, haitians, adopted, other, aspects, of, french, colonial, culture, vodou, drew, influence, from, european, grimoires, commedia, performances, and, freemasonry, with, masonic, lodges, having,

having, played, a, vital, role, in, the, haitian, revolution, although, scholars, debate, the, extent, to, which, this, is, true, according, to, legend, a, vodou, ritual, took, place, in, bois, ca, man, on, 14, august, 1791, at, which, the, participants, swore, to, overthrow, the, slave, owners, before, massacring, local, whites, and, sparking, the, revolution, although, a, popular, tale, in, haitian, folklore, it, has, no, historical, evidence, to, support, it, moreover, two, of, the, revolution, s, early, leaders, boukman, and, francois, mackandal, were, reputed, to, be, powerful, oungans, amid, growing, rebellion, the, french, emperor, napoleon, bonaparte, ordered, troops, into, the, colony, in, 1801, but, in, 1803, the, french, conceded, defeat, and, the, rebel, leader, jean,

farmers, haitians, largely, began, living, in, lakous, or, extended, family, compounds, which, enabled, the, preservation, of, african, derived, creole, religions, these, lakous, often, had, their, own, lwa, rasin, root, lwa, being, intertwined, with, concepts, of, land, and, kinship, many, roman, catholic, missionaries, had, been, killed, in, the, revolution, and, after, its, victory, dessalines, declared, himself, head, of, the, church, in, haiti, protesting, these, actions, the, roman, catholic, church, cut, ties, with, haiti, in, 1805, this, allowed, vodou, to, predominate, in, the, country, many, churches, left, abandoned, were, adopted, for, vodou, rites, continuing, the, syncretization, between, the, two, systems, at, this, point, with, no, new, arrivals, from, africa, vodou, began, to, stabilise, transforming, from, a, widely, scattered, series, of, local, cults, into, a, religion, the, roman, catholic, church, re, established, its, formal, presence, in, haiti, in, 1860, haiti, s, first, three, presidents, sought, to, suppress, vodou, using, police, to, break, up, rituals, which, they, feared, as, a, source, of, rebellion, in, 1847, faustin, soulouque, became, president, he, was, sympathetic, to, vodou, and, allowed, it, to, be, practiced, more, openly, in, the, bizoton, affair, of, 1863, several, vodou, practitioners, were, accused, of, ritually, killing, a, child, before, eating, it, historical, sources, suggest, that, they, may, have, been, tortured, prior, to, confessing, to, the, crime, at, which, they, were, executed, the, affair, received, much, attention, the, united, states, occupied, haiti, between, 1915, and, 1934, although, it, faced, armed, resistance, from, haitian, peasants, many, of, them, vodouists, american, occupation, encouraged, international, interest, in, vodou, something, catered, for, in, the, sensationalist, writings, of, faustin, wirkus, william, seabrook, and, john, craige, as, well, as, in, vodou, themed, shows, for, tourists, the, period, also, saw, the, growing, influence, of, the, roman, catholic, church, and, in, 1941, the, church, backed, operation, nettoyage, operation, cleanup, a, government, campaign, to,

nisme, indigenist, movement, developed, among, haiti, s, middle, classes, later, transmogrifying, into, the, international, n, gritude, movement, these, encouraged, a, more, positive, assessment, of, vodou, and, peasant, culture, a, trend, supported, by, the, appearance, of, professional, ethnological, research, on, the, topic, from, the, 1930s, onward, church, influence, in, haiti, was, curtailed, by, fran, ois, duvalier, the, country, s, president, from, 1957, to, 1971, although, he, restored, catholicism, as, the, state, religion, duvalier, was, widely, perceived, as, a, champion, of, vodou, calling, it, the, supreme, factor, of, haitian, unity, he, utilized, it, for, his, own, purposes, encouraging, rumors, about, his, own, supernatural, powers, and, selecting, oungans, as, his, chefs, de, sections, rural, section, chiefs, after, duvalier, s, son, and, successor, jean, claude, was, overthrown, in, 1986, there, were, attacks, on, vodouists, perceived, to, have, supported, the, duvaliers, partly, motivated, by, protestant, anti, vodou, campaigns, practitioners, called, this, violence, the, dechoukaj, uprooting, two, groups, the, zantray, and, bode, nasyonal, were, formed, to, defend, the, rights, of, vodouists, and, hold, rallies, haiti, s, 1987, constitution, enshrined, freedom, of, religion, after, which, president, jean, bertrand, aristide, granted, vodou, official, recognition, in, 2003, thus, allowing, vodouists, to, officiate, at, civil, ceremonies, such, as, weddings, and, funerals, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, saw, the, substantial, growth, of, evangelical, protestantism, in, haiti, generating, tensions, with, vodouists, these, protestants, regard, vodou, as, satanic, and, unlike, the, roman, catholic, authorities, have, generally, refused, to, compromise, with, its, practitioners, the, 2010, haiti, earthquake, fuelled, conversion, from, vodou, to, protestantism, with, many, protestants, claiming, that, the, earthquake, was, punishment, for, the, sins, of, the, haitian, population, including, their, practice, of, vodou, mob, attacks, on, vodouists, followed, in, the, wake, of, the, earthquake, and, again, following, the, 2010, cholera, outbreak, the, first, three, decades, of, the, 20th, century, saw, growing, haitian, migration, to, eastern, cuba, introducing, vodou, to, the, island, from, 1957, many, haitians, emigrated, to, escape, duvalier, taking, vodou, with, them, in, the, u, s, vodou, has, attracted, non, haitians, especially, african, americans, and, caribbean, migrants, and, has, syncretized, with, other, religions, like, santer, a, and, spiritism, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, those, seeking, to, revive, louisiana, voodoo, initiated, practices, that, brought, the, religion, closer, to, haitian, vodou, or, santer, a, than, it, had, been, early, in, that, century, vodou, is, the, majority, religion, of, haiti, for, most, haitians, practice, both, vodou, and, roman, catholicism, an, often, used, joke, about, haiti, holds, that, the, island, s, population, is, 85, roman, catholic, 15, protestant, and, 100, vodou, even, some, of, those, who, reject, vodou, acknowledge, its, close, associations, with, haitian, identity, it, is, difficult, to, determine, how, many, haitians, practice, vodou, largely, because, the, country, has, never, had, an, accurate, census, and, many, vodouists, will, not, openly, admit, they, practice, the, religion, among, the, country, s, middle, and, upper, classes, for, instance, many, individuals, publicly, decry, vodou, yet, privately, practice, it, estimates, have, nevertheless, been, made, one, suggested, that, 80, of, haitians, practice, vodou, while, in, 1992, desmangles, put, the, number, of, haitian, practitioners, at, six, million, not, all, take, part, in, the, religion, regularly, but, many, will, turn, to, vodou, priests, and, priestesses, when, in, times, of, need, vodouists, learn, about, the, religion, by, taking, part, in, its, rituals, with, children, learning, by, observing, adults, vodou, does, not, focus, on, proselytizing, according, to, brown, it, has, no, pretensions, to, the, universal, it, has, nevertheless, spread, beyond, haiti, including, to, other, caribbean, countries, like, the, dominican, republic, cuba, and, puerto, rico, as, well, as, to, france, and, the, united, states, major, ounf, s, exist, in, u, s, cities, such, as, miami, new, york, city, washington, dc, boston, and, oakland, california, various, scholars, describe, vodou, as, one, of, the, world, s, most, maligned, and, misunderstood, religions, throughout, haitian, history, christians, have, often, presented, vodou, as, satanic, while, in, broader, anglophone, and, francophone, society, it, has, been, widely, associated, with, sorcery, witchcraft, and, black, magic, in, u, s, popular, culture, for, instance, haitian, vodou, is, usually, portrayed, as, destructive, and, malevolent, attitudes, often, linked, with, anti, black, racism, non, practitioners, have, often, depicted, vodou, in, literature, theater, and, film, in, many, cases, such, as, the, films, white, zombie, 1932, and, london, voodoo, 2004, these, promote, sensationalist, views, of, the, religion, the, lack, of, any, central, vodou, authority, has, hindered, efforts, to, combat, these, negative, representations, humanity, s, relationship, with, the, lwa, has, been, a, recurring, theme, in, haitian, art, and, the, vodou, pantheon, was, a, major, topic, for, the, mid, 20th, century, artists, of, the, haitian, renaissance, in, the, late, 1950s, art, collectors, began, to, take, an, interest, in, vodou, ritual, paraphernalia, and, by, the, 1970s, an, established, market, for, this, material, had, emerged, exhibits, of, vodou, ritual, material, have, been, displayed, abroad, the, fowler, museum, s, exhibit, on, sacred, arts, of, haitian, vodou, for, instance, traveled, the, u, s, for, three, years, in, the, 1990s, vodou, has, appeared, in, haitian, literature, and, has, also, influenced, haitian, music, as, with, the, rasin, band, boukman, eksperyans, while, theatre, troupes, have, performed, simulated, vodou, rituals, for, audiences, outside, haiti, documentaries, focusing, on, vodou, have, appeared, such, as, maya, deren, s, 1985, film, divine, horsemen, or, anne, lescot, and, laurence, magloire, s, 2002, work, of, men, and, gods, which, have, in, turn, encouraged, some, viewers, to, take, a, practical, interest, in, the, religion
