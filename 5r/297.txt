https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avesta
the, avesta, v, s, t, is, the, primary, collection, of, religious, literature, of, zoroastrianism, from, at, least, the, late, sassanid, period, ca, 6th, century, ce, it, is, composed, in, the, avestan, language, with, the, oldest, surviving, fragment, of, a, text, in, the, avestan, language, dating, to, 1323, ce, the, avesta, texts, fall, into, several, different, categories, arranged, either, by, dialect, or, by, usage, the, principal, text, in, the, liturgical, group, is, the, yasna, which, takes, its, name, from, the, yasna, ceremony, zoroastrianism, s, primary, act, of, worship, at, which, the, yasna, text, is, recited, the, most, important, portion, of, the, yasna, texts, are, the, five, gathas, consisting, of, seventeen, hymns, attributed, to, zoroaster, himself, these, hymns, together, with, five, other, short, old, avestan, texts, that, are, also, part, of, the, yasna, are, in, the, old, or, gathic, avestan, language, the, remainder, of, the, yasna, s, texts, are, in, younger, avestan, which, is, not, only, from, a, later, stage, of, the, language, but, also, from, a, different, geographic, region, extensions, to, the, yasna, ceremony, include, the, texts, of, the, vendidad, and, the, visperad, the, visperad, extensions, consist, mainly, of, additional, invocations, of, the, divinities, yazata, s, while, the, vendidad, is, a, mixed, collection, of, prose, texts, mostly, dealing, with, purity, laws, even, today, the, vendidad, is, the, only, liturgical, text, that, is, not, recited, entirely, from, memory, some, of, the, materials, of, the, extended, yasna, are, from, the, yashts, which, are, hymns, to, the, individual, yazata, s, unlike, the, yasna, visperad, and, vendidad, the, yasht, s, and, the, other, lesser, texts, of, the, avesta, are, no, longer, used, liturgically, in, high, rituals, aside, from, the, yasht, s, these, other, lesser, texts, include, the, nyayesh, texts, the, gah, texts, the, siroza, and, various, other, fragments, together, these, lesser, texts, are, conventionally, called, khordeh, avesta, or, little, avesta, texts, when, the, first, khordeh, avesta, editions, were, printed, in, the, 19th, century, these, texts, together, with, some, non, avestan, language, prayers, became, a, book, of, common, prayer, for, lay, people, the, term, avesta, originates, from, the, 9th, 10th, century, works, of, zoroastrian, tradition, in, which, the, word, appears, as, middle, persian, abest, g, book, pahlavi, p, y, st, k, in, that, context, abest, g, texts, are, portrayed, as, received, knowledge, and, are, distinguished, from, the, exegetical, commentaries, the, zand, thereof, the, literal, meaning, of, the, word, abest, g, is, uncertain, it, is, generally, acknowledged, to, be, a, learned, borrowing, from, avestan, but, none, of, the, suggested, etymologies, have, been, universally, accepted, the, widely, repeated, derivation, from, upa, stavaka, is, from, christian, bartholomae, altiranisches, w, rterbuch, 1904, who, interpreted, abest, g, as, a, descendant, of, a, hypothetical, reconstructed, old, iranian, word, for, praise, song, bartholomae, lobgesang, but, this, word, is, not, actually, attested, in, any, text, the, surviving, texts, of, the, avesta, as, they, exist, today, derive, from, a, single, master, copy, produced, by, collation, and, recension, in, the, sasanian, empire, 224, 651, ce, that, master, copy, now, lost, is, known, as, the, sassanian, archetype, the, oldest, surviving, manuscript, k1, of, an, avestan, language, text, is, dated, 1323, ce, summaries, of, the, various, avesta, texts, found, in, the, 9th, 10th, century, texts, of, zoroastrian, tradition, suggest, that, a, significant, portion, of, the, literature, in, the, avestan, language, has, been, lost, only, about, one, quarter, of, the, avestan, sentences, or, verses, referred, to, by, the, 9th, 10th, century, commentators, can, be, found, in, the, surviving, texts, this, suggests, that, three, quarters, of, avestan, material, including, an, indeterminable, number, of, juridical, historical, and, legendary, texts, have, been, lost, since, then, on, the, other, hand, it, appears, that, the, most, valuable, portions, of, the, canon, including, all, of, the, oldest, texts, have, survived, the, likely, reason, for, this, is, that, the, surviving, materials, represent, those, portions, of, the, avesta, that, were, in, regular, liturgical, use, and, therefore, known, by, heart, by, the, priests, and, not, dependent, for, their, preservation, on, the, survival, of, particular, manuscripts, interestingly, there, is, apparent, similarity, in, language, and, mythology, between, the, rigveda, and, avesta, a, pre, sasanian, history, of, the, avesta, if, it, had, one, lies, in, the, realm, of, legend, and, myth, the, oldest, surviving, versions, of, these, tales, are, found, in, the, ninth, to, 11th, century, texts, of, zoroastrian, tradition, i, e, in, the, so, called, pahlavi, books, the, legends, run, as, follows, the, twenty, one, nask, s, books, of, the, avesta, were, created, by, ahura, mazda, and, brought, by, zoroaster, to, his, patron, vishtaspa, denkard, 4a, 3a, supposedly, vishtaspa, dk, 3a, or, another, kayanian, daray, dk, 4b, then, had, two, copies, made, one, of, which, was, stored, in, the, treasury, and, the, other, in, the, royal, archives, dk, 4b, 5, following, alexander, s, conquest, the, avesta, was, then, supposedly, destroyed, or, dispersed, by, the, greeks, after, they, had, translated, any, scientific, passages, of, which, they, could, make, use, avn, 7, 9, dk, 3b, 8, several, centuries, later, one, of, the, parthian, emperors, named, valaksh, one, of, the, vologases, supposedly, then, had, the, fragments, collected, not, only, of, those, that, had, previously, been, written, down, but, also, of, those, that, had, only, been, orally, transmitted, dk, 4c, the, denkard, also, records, another, legend, related, to, the, transmission, of, the, avesta, in, this, story, credit, for, collation, and, recension, is, given, to, the, early, sasanian, era, priest, tansar, high, priest, under, ardashir, i, r, 224, 242, ce, and, shapur, i, 240, 242, 272, ce, who, had, the, scattered, works, collected, of, which, he, approved, only, a, part, as, authoritative, dk, 3c, 4d, 4e, tansar, s, work, was, then, supposedly, completed, by, adurbad, mahraspandan, high, priest, of, shapur, ii, r, 309, 379, ce, who, made, a, general, revision, of, the, canon, and, continued, to, ensure, its, orthodoxy, dk, 4f, avn, 1, 12, 1, 16, a, final, revision, was, supposedly, undertaken, in, the, 6th, century, ce, under, khosrow, i, dk, 4g, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, legend, of, the, parthian, era, collation, engendered, a, search, for, a, parthian, archetype, of, the, avesta, according, to, the, theory, of, friedrich, carl, andreas, 1902, the, archaic, nature, of, the, avestan, texts, was, assumed, to, be, due, to, preservation, via, written, transmission, and, unusual, or, unexpected, spellings, in, the, surviving, texts, were, assumed, to, be, reflections, of, errors, introduced, by, sasanian, era, transcription, from, the, aramaic, alphabet, derived, pahlavi, scripts, the, search, for, the, arsacid, archetype, was, increasingly, criticized, in, the, 1940s, and, was, eventually, abandoned, in, the, 1950s, after, karl, hoffmann, demonstrated, that, the, inconsistencies, noted, by, andreas, were, actually, due, to, unconscious, alterations, introduced, by, oral, transmission, hoffmann, identifies, these, changes, to, be, due, in, part, to, modifications, introduced, through, recitation, in, part, to, influences, from, other, iranian, languages, picked, up, on, the, route, of, transmission, from, somewhere, in, eastern, iran, i, e, central, asia, via, arachosia, and, sistan, through, to, persia, and, in, part, due, to, the, influence, of, phonetic, developments, in, the, avestan, language, itself, the, legends, of, an, arsacid, era, collation, and, recension, are, no, longer, taken, seriously, it, is, now, certain, that, for, most, of, their, long, history, the, avesta, s, various, texts, were, handed, down, orally, and, independently, of, one, another, and, that, it, was, not, until, around, the, 5th, or, 6th, century, ce, that, they, were, committed, to, written, form, however, during, their, long, history, only, the, gathic, texts, seem, to, have, been, memorized, more, or, less, exactly, the, other, less, sacred, works, appear, to, have, been, handed, down, in, a, more, fluid, oral, tradition, and, were, partly, composed, afresh, with, each, generation, of, poet, priests, sometimes, with, the, addition, of, new, material, the, younger, avestan, texts, are, therefore, composite, works, with, contributions, from, several, different, authors, over, the, course, of, several, hundred, years, the, texts, became, available, to, european, scholarship, comparatively, late, thus, the, study, of, zoroastrianism, in, western, countries, dates, back, to, only, the, 18th, century, abraham, hyacinthe, anquetil, duperron, travelled, to, india, in, 1755, and, discovered, the, texts, among, indian, zoroastrian, parsi, communities, he, published, a, set, of, french, translations, in, 1771, based, on, translations, provided, by, a, parsi, priest, anquetil, duperron, s, translations, were, at, first, dismissed, as, a, forgery, in, poor, sanskrit, but, he, was, vindicated, in, the, 1820s, following, rasmus, rask, s, examination, of, the, avestan, language, a, dissertation, on, the, authenticity, of, the, zend, language, bombay, 1821, rask, also, established, that, anquetil, duperron, s, manuscripts, were, a, fragment, of, a, much, larger, literature, of, sacred, texts, anquetil, duperron, s, manuscripts, are, at, the, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, p, series, manuscripts, while, rask, s, collection, now, lies, in, the, royal, library, denmark, k, series, other, large, avestan, language, manuscript, collections, are, those, of, the, british, museum, l, series, the, k, r, cama, oriental, library, in, mumbai, the, meherji, rana, library, in, navsari, and, at, various, university, and, national, libraries, in, europe, in, its, present, form, the, avesta, is, a, compilation, from, various, sources, and, its, different, parts, date, from, different, periods, and, vary, widely, in, character, only, texts, in, the, avestan, language, are, considered, part, of, the, avesta, according, to, the, denkard, the, 21, nask, s, books, mirror, the, structure, of, the, 21, word, long, ahuna, vairya, prayer, each, of, the, three, lines, of, the, prayer, consists, of, seven, words, correspondingly, the, nask, s, are, divided, into, three, groups, of, seven, volumes, per, group, originally, each, volume, had, a, word, of, the, prayer, as, its, name, which, so, marked, a, volume, s, position, relative, to, the, other, volumes, only, about, a, quarter, of, the, text, from, the, nask, s, has, survived, to, the, present, day, the, contents, of, the, avesta, are, divided, topically, even, though, the, organization, of, the, nask, s, is, not, but, these, are, not, fixed, or, canonical, some, scholars, prefer, to, place, the, categories, in, two, groups, one, liturgical, and, the, other, general, the, following, categorization, is, as, described, by, jean, kellens, see, bibliography, below, the, yasna, from, yazi, n, worship, oblations, cognate, with, sanskrit, yaj, a, is, the, primary, liturgical, collection, named, after, the, ceremony, at, which, it, is, recited, it, consists, of, 72, sections, called, the, ha, iti, or, ha, the, 72, threads, of, lamb, s, wool, in, the, kushti, the, sacred, thread, worn, by, zoroastrians, represent, these, sections, the, central, portion, of, the, yasna, is, the, gathas, the, oldest, and, most, sacred, portion, of, the, avesta, believed, to, have, been, composed, by, zarathushtra, zoroaster, himself, the, gathas, are, structurally, interrupted, by, the, yasna, haptanghaiti, seven, chapter, yasna, which, makes, up, chapters, 35, 42, of, the, yasna, and, is, almost, as, old, as, the, gathas, consists, of, prayers, and, hymns, in, honor, of, ahura, mazda, the, yazatas, the, fravashi, fire, water, and, earth, the, younger, yasna, though, handed, down, in, prose, may, once, have, been, metrical, as, the, gathas, still, are, the, visperad, from, v, spe, ratavo, prayer, to, all, patrons, is, a, collection, of, supplements, to, the, yasna, the, visparad, is, subdivided, into, 23, or, 24, kardo, sections, that, are, interleaved, into, the, yasna, during, a, visperad, service, which, is, an, extended, yasna, service, the, visperad, collection, has, no, unity, of, its, own, and, is, never, recited, separately, from, the, yasna, the, vendidad, or, vid, vd, t, a, corruption, of, avestan, v, da, v, d, ta, given, against, the, demons, is, an, enumeration, of, various, manifestations, of, evil, spirits, and, ways, to, confound, them, the, vendidad, includes, all, of, the, 19th, nask, which, is, the, only, nask, that, has, survived, in, its, entirety, the, text, consists, of, 22, fargard, s, fragments, arranged, as, discussions, between, ahura, mazda, and, zoroaster, the, first, fargard, is, a, dualistic, creation, myth, followed, by, the, description, of, a, destructive, winter, compare, fimbulvetr, on, the, lines, of, the, flood, myth, the, second, fargard, recounts, the, legend, of, yima, the, remaining, fargard, s, deal, primarily, with, hygiene, care, of, the, dead, in, particular, as, well, as, disease, and, spells, to, fight, it, fargard, s, 4, and, 15, discuss, the, dignity, of, wealth, and, charity, of, marriage, and, of, physical, effort, and, the, indignity, of, unacceptable, social, behaviour, such, as, assault, and, breach, of, contract, and, specify, the, penances, required, to, atone, for, violations, thereof, the, vendidad, is, an, ecclesiastical, code, not, a, liturgical, manual, and, there, is, a, degree, of, moral, relativism, apparent, in, the, codes, of, conduct, the, vendidad, s, different, parts, vary, widely, in, character, and, in, age, some, parts, may, be, comparatively, recent, in, origin, although, the, greater, part, is, very, old, the, vendidad, unlike, the, yasna, and, the, visparad, is, a, book, of, moral, laws, rather, than, the, record, of, a, liturgical, ceremony, however, there, is, a, ceremony, called, the, vendidad, in, which, the, yasna, is, recited, with, all, the, chapters, of, both, the, visparad, and, the, vendidad, inserted, at, appropriate, points, this, ceremony, is, only, performed, at, night, the, yasht, s, from, ye, ti, worship, by, praise, are, a, collection, of, 21, hymns, each, dedicated, to, a, particular, divinity, or, divine, concept, three, hymns, of, the, yasna, liturgy, that, worship, by, praise, are, in, tradition, also, nominally, called, yasht, s, but, are, not, counted, among, the, yasht, collection, since, the, three, are, a, part, of, the, primary, liturgy, the, yasht, s, vary, greatly, in, style, quality, and, extent, in, their, present, form, they, are, all, in, prose, but, analysis, suggests, that, they, may, at, one, time, have, been, in, verse, the, siroza, thirty, days, is, an, enumeration, and, invocation, of, the, 30, divinities, presiding, over, the, days, of, the, month, cf, zoroastrian, calendar, the, siroza, exists, in, two, forms, the, shorter, little, siroza, is, a, brief, enumeration, of, the, divinities, with, their, epithets, in, the, genitive, the, longer, great, siroza, has, complete, sentences, and, sections, with, the, yazata, s, being, addressed, in, the, accusative, the, siroza, is, never, recited, as, a, whole, but, is, a, source, for, individual, sentences, devoted, to, particular, divinities, to, be, inserted, at, appropriate, points, in, the, liturgy, depending, on, the, day, and, the, month, the, five, nyayesh, es, abbreviated, ny, are, prayers, for, regular, recitation, by, both, priests, and, laity, they, are, addressed, to, the, sun, and, mithra, recited, together, thrice, a, day, to, the, moon, recited, thrice, a, month, and, to, the, waters, and, to, fire, the, nyayesh, es, are, composite, texts, containing, selections, from, the, gathas, and, the, yashts, as, well, as, later, material, the, five, g, h, s, are, invocations, to, the, five, divinities, that, watch, over, the, five, divisions, g, h, s, of, the, day, g, h, s, are, similar, in, structure, and, content, to, the, five, nyayesh, es, the, afrinagan, s, are, four, blessing, texts, recited, on, a, particular, occasion, the, first, in, honor, of, the, dead, the, second, on, the, five, epagomenal, days, that, end, the, year, the, third, is, recited, at, the, six, seasonal, feasts, and, the, fourth, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, summer, all, material, in, the, avesta, that, is, not, already, present, in, one, of, the, other, categories, is, placed, in, a, fragments, category, which, as, the, name, suggests, includes, incomplete, texts, there, are, altogether, more, than, 20, fragment, collections, many, of, which, have, no, name, and, are, then, named, after, their, owner, collator, or, only, a, middle, persian, name, the, more, important, of, the, fragment, collections, are, the, nirangistan, fragments, 18, of, which, constitute, the, ehrbadistan, the, pursishniha, questions, also, known, as, fragments, tahmuras, and, the, hadokht, nask, volume, of, the, scriptures, with, two, fragments, of, eschatological, significance
