old, norse, religion, also, known, as, norse, paganism, is, a, branch, of, germanic, religion, which, developed, during, the, proto, norse, period, when, the, north, germanic, peoples, separated, into, a, distinct, branch, of, the, germanic, peoples, it, was, replaced, by, christianity, and, forgotten, during, the, christianisation, of, scandinavia, scholars, reconstruct, aspects, of, north, germanic, religion, by, historical, linguistics, archaeology, toponymy, and, records, left, by, north, germanic, peoples, such, as, runic, inscriptions, in, the, younger, futhark, a, distinctly, north, germanic, extension, of, the, runic, alphabet, numerous, old, norse, works, dated, to, the, 13th, century, record, norse, mythology, a, component, of, north, germanic, religion, old, norse, religion, was, polytheistic, entailing, a, belief, in, various, gods, and, goddesses, these, deities, in, norse, mythology, were, divided, into, two, groups, the, sir, and, the, vanir, who, in, some, sources, were, said, to, have, engaged, in, an, ancient, war, until, realizing, that, they, were, equally, powerful, among, the, most, widespread, deities, were, the, gods, odin, and, thor, this, world, was, inhabited, also, by, various, other, mythological, races, including, j, tnar, dwarfs, elves, and, land, wights, norse, cosmology, revolved, around, a, world, tree, known, as, yggdrasil, with, various, realms, existing, alongside, that, of, humans, named, midgard, these, include, multiple, afterlife, realms, several, of, which, are, controlled, by, a, particular, deity, transmitted, through, oral, culture, rather, than, through, codified, texts, old, norse, religion, focused, heavily, on, ritual, practice, with, kings, and, chiefs, playing, a, central, role, in, carrying, out, public, acts, of, sacrifice, various, cultic, spaces, were, used, initially, outdoor, spaces, such, as, groves, and, lakes, were, typically, selected, but, after, the, third, century, ce, cult, houses, seem, to, also, have, been, purposely, built, for, ritual, activity, although, they, were, never, widespread, norse, society, also, contained, practitioners, of, sei, r, a, form, of, sorcery, that, some, scholars, describe, as, shamanistic, various, forms, of, burial, were, conducted, including, both, inhumation, and, cremation, typically, accompanied, by, a, variety, of, grave, goods, throughout, its, history, varying, levels, of, trans, cultural, diffusion, occurred, among, neighbouring, peoples, such, as, the, sami, and, finns, by, the, 12th, century, old, norse, religion, had, been, replaced, by, christianity, with, elements, continuing, into, scandinavian, folklore, a, revival, of, interest, in, old, norse, religion, occurred, amid, the, romanticist, movement, of, the, 19th, century, during, which, it, inspired, a, range, of, artworks, academic, research, into, the, subject, began, in, the, early, 19th, century, initially, influenced, by, the, pervasive, romanticist, sentiment, the, archaeologist, anders, andr, n, noted, that, old, norse, religion, is, the, conventional, name, applied, to, the, pre, christian, religions, of, scandinavia, see, for, instance, other, terms, used, by, scholarly, sources, include, pre, christian, norse, religion, norse, religion, norse, paganism, nordic, paganism, scandinavian, paganism, scandinavian, heathenism, scandinavian, religion, northern, paganism, northern, heathenism, north, germanic, religion, or, north, germanic, paganism, this, old, norse, religion, can, be, seen, as, part, of, a, broader, germanic, religion, found, across, linguistically, germanic, europe, of, the, different, forms, of, this, germanic, religion, that, of, the, old, norse, is, the, best, documented, rooted, in, ritual, practice, and, oral, tradition, old, norse, religion, was, fully, integrated, with, other, aspects, of, norse, life, including, subsistence, warfare, and, social, interactions, open, codifications, of, old, norse, beliefs, were, either, rare, or, non, existent, the, practitioners, of, this, belief, system, themselves, had, no, term, meaning, religion, which, was, only, introduced, with, christianity, following, christianity, s, arrival, old, norse, terms, that, were, used, for, the, pre, christian, systems, were, forn, si, old, custom, or, hei, inn, si, heathen, custom, terms, which, suggest, an, emphasis, on, rituals, actions, and, behaviours, rather, than, belief, itself, the, earliest, known, usage, of, the, old, norse, term, hei, inn, is, in, the, poem, h, konarm, l, its, uses, here, indicates, that, the, arrival, of, christianity, has, generated, consciousness, of, old, norse, religion, as, a, distinct, religion, old, norse, religion, has, been, classed, as, an, ethnic, religion, and, as, a, non, doctrinal, community, religion, it, varied, across, time, in, different, regions, and, locales, and, according, to, social, differences, this, variation, is, partly, due, to, its, transmission, through, oral, culture, rather, than, codified, texts, for, this, reason, the, archaeologists, andr, n, kristina, jennbert, and, catharina, raudvere, stated, that, pre, christian, norse, religion, is, not, a, uniform, or, stable, category, while, the, scholar, karen, bek, pedersen, noted, that, the, old, norse, belief, system, should, probably, be, conceived, of, in, the, plural, as, several, systems, the, historian, of, religion, hilda, ellis, davidson, stated, that, it, would, have, ranged, from, manifestations, of, complex, symbolism, to, the, simple, folk, beliefs, of, the, less, sophisticated, during, the, viking, age, the, norse, likely, regarded, themselves, as, a, more, or, less, unified, entity, through, their, shared, germanic, language, old, norse, the, scholar, of, scandinavian, studies, thomas, a, dubois, said, old, norse, religion, and, other, pre, christian, belief, systems, in, northern, europe, must, be, viewed, as, not, as, isolated, mutually, exclusive, language, bound, entities, but, as, broad, concepts, shared, across, cultural, and, linguistic, lines, conditioned, by, similar, ecological, factors, and, protracted, economic, and, cultural, ties, during, this, period, the, norse, interacted, closely, with, other, ethnocultural, and, linguistic, groups, such, as, the, s, mi, balto, finns, anglo, saxons, greenlandic, inuit, and, various, speakers, of, celtic, and, slavic, languages, economic, marital, and, religious, exchange, occurred, between, the, norse, and, many, of, these, other, groups, enslaved, individuals, from, the, british, isles, were, common, throughout, the, nordic, world, during, the, viking, age, different, elements, of, old, norse, religion, had, different, origins, and, histories, some, aspects, may, derive, from, deep, into, prehistory, others, only, emerging, following, the, encounter, with, christianity, in, hilda, ellis, davidson, s, words, present, day, knowledge, of, old, norse, religion, contains, vast, gaps, and, we, must, be, cautious, and, avoid, bas, wild, assumptions, on, isolated, details, a, few, runic, inscriptions, with, religious, content, survive, from, scandinavia, particularly, asking, thor, to, hallow, or, protect, a, memorial, stone, carving, his, hammer, on, the, stone, also, served, this, function, in, contrast, to, the, few, runic, fragments, a, considerable, body, of, literary, and, historical, sources, survive, in, old, norse, manuscripts, using, the, latin, script, all, of, which, were, created, after, the, christianisation, of, scandinavia, the, majority, in, iceland, the, first, extensive, nordic, textual, source, for, the, old, norse, religion, was, the, poetic, edda, some, of, the, poetic, sources, in, particular, the, poetic, edda, and, skaldic, poetry, may, have, been, originally, composed, by, heathens, and, h, vam, l, contains, both, information, on, heathen, mysticism, and, what, ursula, dronke, referred, to, as, a, round, up, of, ritual, obligations, in, addition, there, is, information, about, pagan, beliefs, and, practices, in, the, sagas, which, include, both, historical, sagas, such, as, snorri, sturluson, s, heimskringla, and, the, landn, mab, k, recounting, the, settlement, and, early, history, of, iceland, and, the, so, called, sagas, of, icelanders, concerning, icelandic, individuals, and, groups, there, are, also, more, or, less, fantastical, legendary, sagas, many, skaldic, verses, are, preserved, in, sagas, of, the, originally, heathen, works, we, cannot, know, what, changes, took, place, either, during, oral, transmission, or, as, a, result, of, their, being, recorded, by, christians, the, sagas, of, icelanders, in, particular, are, now, regarded, by, most, scholars, as, more, or, less, historical, fiction, rather, than, as, detailed, historical, records, a, large, amount, of, mythological, poetry, has, undoubtedly, been, lost, one, important, written, source, is, snorri, s, prose, edda, which, incorporates, a, manual, of, norse, mythology, for, the, use, of, poets, in, constructing, kennings, it, also, includes, numerous, citations, some, of, them, the, only, record, of, lost, poems, such, as, j, lfr, of, hvinir, s, haustl, ng, snorri, s, prologue, eumerises, the, sir, as, trojans, deriving, sir, from, asia, and, some, scholars, have, suspected, that, many, of, the, stories, that, we, only, have, from, him, are, also, derived, from, christian, medieval, culture, additional, sources, remain, by, non, scandinavians, writing, in, languages, other, than, old, norse, the, first, non, scandinavian, textual, source, for, the, old, norse, religion, was, tacitus, book, the, germania, which, dates, back, to, around, 100, ce, and, describes, religious, practices, of, several, germanic, peoples, but, has, little, coverage, of, scandinavia, in, the, middle, ages, several, christian, commentators, also, wrote, about, scandinavian, paganism, mostly, from, a, hostile, perspective, the, best, known, of, these, are, adam, of, bremen, s, gesta, hammaburgensis, ecclesiae, pontificum, history, of, the, bishops, of, hamburg, written, between, 1066, and, 1072, which, includes, an, account, of, the, temple, at, uppsala, and, saxo, grammaticus, 12th, century, gesta, danorum, history, of, the, danes, which, includes, versions, of, norse, myths, and, some, material, on, pagan, religious, practices, in, addition, muslim, arabs, wrote, accounts, of, norse, people, they, encountered, the, best, known, of, which, is, ibn, fadlan, s, 10th, century, risala, an, account, of, volga, viking, traders, that, includes, a, detailed, description, of, a, ship, burial, since, the, literary, evidence, that, represents, old, norse, sources, were, recorded, by, christians, archaeological, evidence, especially, of, religious, sites, and, burials, is, of, great, importance, particularly, as, a, source, of, information, on, norse, religion, before, the, conversion, many, aspects, of, material, culture, including, settlement, locations, artefacts, and, buildings, may, cast, light, on, beliefs, and, archaeological, evidence, regarding, religious, practices, indicates, chronological, geographic, and, class, differences, far, greater, than, are, suggested, by, the, surviving, texts, place, names, are, an, additional, source, of, evidence, theophoric, place, names, including, instances, where, a, pair, of, deity, names, occur, near, provide, an, indication, of, the, importance, of, the, religion, of, those, deities, in, different, areas, dating, back, to, before, our, earliest, written, sources, the, toponymic, evidence, shows, considerable, regional, variation, and, some, deities, such, as, ullr, and, h, rn, occur, more, frequently, than, odin, place, names, occur, in, other, locations, some, place, names, contain, elements, indicating, that, they, were, sites, of, religious, activity, those, formed, with, v, h, rgr, and, hof, words, for, religious, sites, of, various, kinds, and, also, likely, those, formed, with, akr, or, vin, words, for, field, when, coupled, with, the, name, of, a, deity, magnus, olsen, developed, a, typology, of, such, place, names, in, norway, from, which, he, posited, a, development, in, pagan, worship, from, groves, and, fields, toward, the, use, of, temple, buildings, personal, names, are, also, a, source, of, information, on, the, popularity, of, certain, deities, for, example, thor, s, name, was, an, element, in, the, names, of, both, men, and, women, particularly, in, iceland, andr, n, described, old, norse, religion, as, a, cultural, patchwork, which, emerged, under, a, wide, range, of, influences, from, earlier, scandinavian, religions, it, may, have, had, links, to, nordic, bronze, age, while, the, putatively, solar, oriented, belief, system, of, bronze, age, scandinavia, is, believed, to, have, died, out, around, 500, bce, several, bronze, age, motifs, such, as, the, wheel, cross, reappear, in, later, iron, age, contexts, it, is, often, regarded, as, having, developed, from, earlier, religious, belief, systems, found, among, the, germanic, iron, age, peoples, the, germanic, languages, likely, emerged, in, the, first, millennium, bce, in, present, day, denmark, or, northern, germany, after, which, they, spread, several, of, the, deities, in, old, norse, religion, have, parallels, among, other, germanic, societies, the, scandinavian, iron, age, began, around, 500, to, 400, bce, archaeological, evidence, is, particularly, important, for, understanding, these, early, periods, accounts, from, this, time, were, produced, by, tacitus, according, to, the, scholar, gabriel, turville, petre, tacitus, observations, help, to, explain, later, old, norse, religion, tacitus, described, the, germanic, peoples, as, having, priests, open, air, sacred, sites, and, seasonal, sacrifices, and, feasts, tacitus, notes, that, the, germanic, peoples, were, polytheistic, and, mentions, some, of, their, deities, trying, to, perceive, them, through, roman, equivalents, so, romans, could, try, to, understand, during, the, viking, age, norse, people, left, scandinavia, and, settled, elsewhere, throughout, northwestern, europe, some, of, these, areas, such, as, iceland, the, orkney, and, shetland, islands, and, the, faroe, islands, were, hardly, populated, whereas, other, areas, such, as, england, southwest, wales, scotland, the, western, isles, isle, of, man, and, ireland, were, already, heavily, populated, in, the, 870s, norwegian, settlers, left, their, homeland, and, colonized, iceland, bringing, their, belief, system, with, them, place, name, evidence, suggests, that, thor, was, the, most, popular, god, on, the, island, although, there, are, also, saga, accounts, of, devot, s, of, freyr, in, iceland, including, a, priest, of, freyr, in, the, later, hrafnkels, saga, there, are, no, place, names, connected, to, odin, on, the, island, unlike, other, nordic, societies, iceland, lacked, a, monarchy, and, thus, a, centralising, authority, which, could, enforce, religious, adherence, there, were, both, old, norse, and, christian, communities, from, the, time, of, its, first, settlement, scandinavian, settlers, brought, old, norse, religion, to, britain, in, the, latter, decades, of, the, ninth, century, several, british, place, names, indicate, possible, religious, sites, for, instance, roseberry, topping, in, north, yorkshire, was, known, as, othensberg, in, the, twelfth, century, a, name, deriving, from, the, old, norse, insberg, hill, of, in, several, place, names, also, contain, old, norse, references, to, religious, entities, such, as, alfr, skratii, and, troll, the, english, church, found, itself, in, need, of, conducting, a, new, conversion, process, to, christianise, this, incoming, population, the, nordic, world, first, encountered, christianity, through, its, settlements, in, the, already, christian, british, isles, and, through, trade, contacts, with, the, eastern, christians, in, novgorod, and, byzantium, by, the, time, christianity, arrived, in, scandinavia, it, was, already, the, accepted, religion, across, most, of, europe, it, is, not, well, understood, how, the, christian, institutions, converted, these, scandinavian, settlers, in, part, due, to, a, lack, of, textual, descriptions, of, this, conversion, process, equivalent, to, bede, s, description, of, the, earlier, anglo, saxon, conversion, however, it, appears, that, the, scandinavian, migrants, had, converted, to, christianity, within, the, first, few, decades, of, their, arrival, after, christian, missionaries, from, the, british, isles, including, figures, like, st, willibrord, st, boniface, and, willehad, had, travelled, to, parts, of, northern, europe, in, the, eighth, century, charlemagne, pushed, for, christianisation, in, denmark, with, ebbo, of, rheims, halitgar, of, cambrai, and, willeric, of, bremen, proselytizing, in, the, kingdom, during, the, ninth, century, the, danish, king, harald, klak, converted, 826, likely, to, secure, his, political, alliance, with, louis, the, pious, against, his, rivals, for, the, throne, the, danish, monarchy, reverted, to, old, norse, religion, under, horik, ii, 854, c, 867, the, norwegian, king, h, kon, the, good, had, converted, to, christianity, while, in, england, on, returning, to, norway, he, kept, his, faith, largely, private, but, encouraged, christian, priests, to, preach, among, the, population, some, pagans, were, angered, and, according, to, heimskringla, three, churches, built, near, trondheim, were, burned, down, his, successor, harald, greycloak, was, also, a, christian, but, similarly, had, little, success, in, converting, the, norwegian, population, to, his, religion, haakon, sigurdsson, later, became, the, de, facto, ruler, of, norway, and, although, he, agreed, to, be, baptised, under, pressure, from, the, danish, king, and, allowed, christians, to, preach, in, the, kingdom, he, enthusiastically, supported, pagan, sacrificial, customs, asserting, the, superiority, of, the, traditional, deities, and, encouraging, christians, to, return, to, their, veneration, his, reign, 975, 995, saw, the, emergence, of, a, state, paganism, an, official, ideology, which, bound, together, norwegian, identity, with, pagan, identity, and, rallied, support, behind, haakon, s, leadership, haakon, was, killed, in, 995, and, olaf, tryggvason, the, next, king, took, power, and, enthusiastically, promoted, christianity, he, forced, high, status, norwegians, to, convert, destroyed, temples, and, killed, those, he, called, sorcerers, sweden, was, the, last, scandinavian, country, to, officially, convert, although, little, is, known, about, the, process, of, christianisation, it, is, known, that, the, swedish, kings, had, converted, by, the, early, 11th, century, and, that, the, country, was, fully, christian, by, the, early, 12th, olaf, tryggvason, sent, a, saxon, missionary, angbrandr, to, iceland, many, icelanders, were, angered, by, angbrandr, s, proselytising, and, he, was, outlawed, after, killing, several, poets, who, insulted, him, animosity, between, christians, and, pagans, on, the, island, grew, and, at, the, althing, in, 998, both, sides, blasphemed, each, other, s, gods, in, an, attempt, to, preserve, unity, at, the, althing, in, 999, an, agreement, was, reached, that, the, icelandic, law, would, be, based, on, christian, principles, albeit, with, concessions, to, the, pagan, community, private, albeit, not, public, pagan, sacrifices, and, rites, were, to, remain, legal, across, germanic, europe, conversion, to, christianity, was, closely, connected, to, social, ties, mass, conversion, was, the, norm, rather, than, individual, conversion, a, primary, motivation, for, kings, converting, was, the, desire, for, support, from, christian, rulers, whether, as, money, imperial, sanction, or, military, support, christian, missionaries, found, it, difficult, convincing, norse, people, that, the, two, belief, systems, were, mutually, exclusive, the, polytheistic, nature, of, old, norse, religion, allowed, its, practitioners, to, accept, jesus, christ, as, one, god, among, many, the, encounter, with, christianity, could, also, stimulate, new, and, innovative, expressions, of, pagan, culture, for, instance, through, influencing, various, pagan, myths, as, with, other, germanic, societies, syncretisation, between, incoming, and, traditional, belief, systems, took, place, for, those, living, in, isolated, areas, pre, christian, beliefs, likely, survived, longer, while, others, continued, as, survivals, in, folklore, by, the, 12th, century, christianity, was, firmly, established, across, northwestern, europe, for, two, centuries, scandinavian, ecclesiastics, continued, to, condemn, paganism, although, it, is, unclear, whether, it, still, constituted, a, viable, alternative, to, christian, dominance, these, writers, often, presented, paganism, as, being, based, on, deceit, or, delusion, some, stated, that, the, old, norse, gods, had, been, humans, falsely, euhemerised, as, deities, old, norse, mythological, stories, survived, in, oral, culture, for, at, least, two, centuries, being, recorded, in, the, 13th, century, how, this, mythology, was, passed, down, is, unclear, it, is, possible, that, pockets, of, pagans, retained, their, belief, system, throughout, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, or, that, it, had, survived, as, a, cultural, artefact, passed, down, by, christians, who, retained, the, stories, while, rejecting, any, literal, belief, in, them, the, historian, judith, jesch, suggested, that, following, christianisation, there, remained, a, cultural, paganism, the, re, use, of, pre, christian, myth, in, certain, cultural, and, social, contexts, that, are, officially, christian, for, instance, old, norse, mythological, themes, and, motifs, appear, in, poetry, composed, for, the, court, of, cnut, the, great, an, eleventh, century, christian, anglo, scandinavian, king, saxo, is, the, earliest, medieval, figure, to, take, a, revived, interest, in, the, pre, christian, beliefs, of, his, ancestors, doing, so, not, out, of, a, desire, to, revive, their, faith, but, out, of, historical, interest, snorri, was, also, part, of, this, revived, interest, examining, pagan, myths, from, his, perspective, as, a, cultural, historian, and, mythographer, as, a, result, norse, mythology, long, outlasted, any, worship, of, or, belief, in, the, gods, it, depicts, there, remained, however, remnants, of, norse, pagan, rituals, for, centuries, after, christianity, became, the, dominant, religion, in, scandinavia, see, trollkyrka, old, norse, gods, continued, to, appear, in, swedish, folklore, up, until, the, early, 20th, century, there, are, documented, accounts, of, encounters, with, both, thor, and, odin, along, with, a, belief, in, freja, s, power, over, fertility, norse, mythology, stories, of, the, norse, deities, is, preserved, in, eddic, poetry, and, in, snorri, sturluson, s, guide, for, skalds, the, poetic, edda, depictions, of, some, of, these, stories, can, be, found, on, picture, stones, in, gotland, and, in, other, visual, records, including, some, early, christian, crosses, which, attests, to, how, widely, known, they, were, the, myths, were, transmitted, purely, orally, until, the, end, of, the, period, and, were, subject, to, variation, one, key, poem, v, lusp, is, preserved, in, two, variant, versions, in, different, manuscripts, and, snorri, s, retelling, of, the, myths, sometimes, varies, from, the, other, textual, sources, that, are, preserved, there, was, no, single, authoritative, version, of, a, particular, myth, and, variation, over, time, and, from, place, to, place, is, presumed, rather, than, a, single, unified, body, of, thought, in, particular, there, may, have, been, influences, from, interactions, with, other, peoples, including, northern, slavs, finns, and, anglo, saxons, and, christian, mythology, exerted, an, increasing, influence, old, norse, religion, was, polytheistic, with, many, anthropomorphic, gods, and, goddesses, who, express, human, emotions, and, in, some, cases, are, married, and, have, children, one, god, baldr, is, said, in, the, myths, to, have, died, archaeological, evidence, on, the, worship, of, particular, gods, is, sparse, although, placenames, may, also, indicate, locations, where, they, were, venerated, for, some, gods, particularly, loki, there, is, no, evidence, of, worship, however, this, may, be, changed, by, new, archaeological, discoveries, regions, communities, and, social, classes, likely, varied, in, the, gods, they, venerated, more, or, at, all, there, are, also, accounts, in, sagas, of, individuals, who, devoted, themselves, to, a, single, deity, described, as, a, fulltr, i, or, vinr, confidant, friend, as, seen, in, egill, skallagr, msson, s, reference, to, his, relationship, with, odin, in, his, sonatorrek, a, tenth, century, skaldic, poem, for, example, this, practice, has, been, interpreted, as, heathen, past, influenced, by, the, christian, cult, of, the, saints, although, our, literary, sources, are, all, relatively, late, there, are, also, indications, of, change, over, time, norse, mythological, sources, particularly, snorri, and, v, lusp, differentiate, between, two, groups, of, deities, the, sir, and, the, vanir, who, fought, a, war, during, which, the, vanir, broke, down, the, walls, of, the, sir, s, stronghold, asgard, and, eventually, made, peace, utilizing, a, truce, and, the, exchange, of, hostages, some, mythographers, have, suggested, that, this, myth, was, based, on, recollection, of, a, conflict, in, scandinavia, between, adherents, of, different, belief, systems, major, deities, among, the, sir, include, thor, who, is, often, referred, to, in, literary, texts, as, asa, thor, odin, and, t, r, very, few, vanir, are, named, in, the, sources, nj, r, r, his, son, freyr, and, his, daughter, freyja, according, to, snorri, all, of, these, could, be, called, vanagu, vanir, god, and, freyja, also, vanad, s, vanir, d, s, the, status, of, loki, within, the, pantheon, is, problematic, and, according, to, lokasenna, and, v, lusp, and, snorri, s, explanation, he, is, imprisoned, beneath, the, earth, until, ragnarok, when, he, will, fight, against, the, gods, as, far, back, as, 1889,

have, been, personal, or, family, goddesses, venerated, by, haakon, sigurdsson, a, late, pagan, ruler, of, norway, there, are, also, likely, to, have, been, local, and, family, fertility, cults, there, is, one, reported, example, from, pagan, norway, in, the, family, cult, of, v, lsi, where, a, deity, called, m, rnir, is, invoked, the, norns, are, female, figures, who, determine, individuals, fate, snorri, describes, them, as, a, group, of, three, but, he, and, other, sources, also, allude, to, larger, groups, of, norns, who, decide, the, fate, of, newborns, it, is, uncertain, whether, they, were, worshipped, the, landv, ttir, spirits, of, the, land, were, thought, to, inhabit, certain, rocks, waterfalls, mountains, and, trees, and, offerings, were, made, to, them, for, many, they, may, have, been, more, important, in, daily, life, than, the, gods, texts, also, mention, various, kinds, of, elves, and, dwarfs, fylgjur, guardian, spirits, generally, female, were, associated, with,

assist, and, marry, heroes, conflict, with, the, j, tnar, and, g, gjar, often, glossed, as, giants, and, giantesses, respectively, is, a, frequent, motif, in, the, mythology, they, are, described, as, both, the, ancestors, and, enemies, of, the, gods, gods, marry, g, gjar, but, j, tnar, s, attempts, to, couple, with, goddesses, are, repulsed, most, scholars, believe, the, j, tnar, were, not, worshipped, although, this, has, been, questioned, the, eddic, j, tnar, have, parallels, with, their, later, folkloric, counterparts, although, unlike, them, they, have, much, wisdom, several, accounts, of, the, old, norse, cosmogony, or, creation, myth, appear, in, surviving, textual, sources, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, these, were, certainly, produced, in, the, pre, christian, period, it, is, possible, that, they, were, developed, during, the, encounter, with, christianity, as, pagans, sought, to, establish, a, creation, myth, complex, enough, to, rival, that, of, christianity, these, accounts, could, also, be, the, result, of, christian, missionaries, interpreting, certain, elements, and, tales, found, in, the, old, norse, culture, and, presenting, them, to, be, creation, myths, and, a, cosmogony, parallel, to, that, of, the, bible, in, part, to, aid, the, old, norse, in, the, understanding, of, the, new, christian, religion, through, the, use, of, native, elements, as, a, means, to, facilitate, conversion, a, common, practice, employed, by, missionaries, to, ease, the, conversion, of, people, from, different, cultures, across, the, globe, see, syncretism, according, to, the, account, in, v, lusp, the, universe, was, initially, a, void, known, as, ginnungagap, there, then, appeared, a, j, tunn, ymir, and, after, him, the, gods, who, lifted, the, earth, out, of, the, sea, a, different, account, is, provided, in, vaf, r, nism, l, which, describes, that, the, world, is, made, from, the, components, of, ymir, s, body, the, earth, from, his, flesh, the, mountains, from, his, bones, the, sky, from, his, skull, and, the, sea, from, his, blood, gr, mnism, l, also, describes, the, world, being, fashioned, from, ymir, s, corpse, although, adds, the, detail, that, the, j, tnar, emerged, from, a, spring, known, as, liv, gar, in, snorri, s, gylfaginning, it, is, again, stated, that, the, old, norse, cosmogony, began, with, a, belief, in, ginnungagap, the, void, from, this, emerged, two, realms, the, icy, misty, niflheim, and, the, fire, filled, muspell, the, latter, ruled, over, by, fire, j, tunn, surtr, a, river, produced, by, these, realms, coagulated, to, form, ymir, while, a, cow, known, as, audumbla, then, appeared, to, provide, him, with, milk, audumbla, licked, a, block, of, ice, to, free, buri, whose, son, bor, married, a, g, gr, named, bestla, some, of, the, features, of, this, myth, such, as, the, cow, audumbla, are, of, unclear, provenance, snorri, does, not, specify, where, he, obtained, these, details, as, he, did, for, other, parts, of, the, myths, and, it, may, be, that, these, were, his, inventions, v, lusp, portrays, yggdrasil, as, a, giant, ash, tree, gr, mnism, l, claims, that, the, deities, meet, beneath, yggdrasil, daily, to, pass, judgement, it, also, claims, that, a, serpent, gnaws, at, its, roots, while, a, deer, grazes, from, its, higher, branches, a, squirrel, runs, between, the, two, animals, exchanging, messages, gr, mnism, l, also, claims, that, yggdrasil, has, three, roots, under, one, resides, the, goddess, hel, under, another, the, frost, ursar, and, under, the, third, humanity, snorri, also, relates, that, hel, and, the, frost, ursar, live, under, two, of, the, roots, but, places, the, gods, rather, than, humanity, under, the, third, root, the, term, yggr, means, the, terrifier, and, is, a, synonym, for, o, inn, while, drasill, was, a, poetic, word, for, a, horse, yggdrasil, thereby, means, o, inn, s, steed, this, idea, of, a, cosmic, tree, has, parallels, with, those, from, various, other, societies, and, may, reflect, part, of, a, common, indo, european, heritage, the, ragnarok, story, survives, in, its, fullest, exposition, in, v, lusp, although, elements, can, also, be, seen, in, earlier, poetry, the, ragnarok, story, suggests, that, the, idea, of, an, inescapable, fate, pervaded, norse, worldviews, there, is, much, evidence, that, v, lusp, was, influenced, by, christian, belief, and, it, is, also, possible, that, the, theme, of, conflict, being, followed, by, a, better, future, as, reflected, in, the, ragnarok, story, perhaps, reflected, the, period, of, conflict, between, paganism, and, christianity, old, nordic, religion, had, several, fully, developed, ideas, about, death, and, the, afterlife, snorri, refers, to, multiple, realms, which, welcome, the, dead, although, his, descriptions, reflect, a, likely, christian, influence, the, idea, of, a, plurality, of, other, worlds, is, likely, pre, christian, unlike, christianity, old, norse, religion, does, not, appear, to, have, adhered, to, the, belief, that, moral, concerns, impacted, an, individual, s, afterlife, destination, warriors, who, died, in, battle, became, the, einherjar, and, were, taken, to, o, inn, s, hall, valhalla, there, they, waited, until, ragnarok, when, they, would, fight, alongside, the, sir, according, to, the, poem, gr, mnism, l, valhalla, had, 540, doors, and, a, wolf, stood, outside, its, western, door, while, an, eagle, flew, overhead, in, that, poem, it, is, also, claimed, that, a, boar, named, s, hr, mnir, is, eaten, every, day, and, that, a, goat, named, hei, r, n, stands, atop, the, hall, s, roof, producing, an, endless, supply, of, mead, it, is, unclear, how, widespread, a, belief, in, valhalla, was, in, norse, society, it, may, have, been, a, literary, creation, designed, to, meet, the, ruling, class, aspirations, since, the, idea, of, deceased, warriors, owing, military, service, to, o, inn, parallels, the, social, structure, between, warriors, and, their, lord, there, is, no, archaeological, evidence, clearly, alluding, to, a, belief, in, valhalla, according, to, snorri, while, one, half, of, the, slain, go, to, valhalla, the, others, go, to, frejya, s, hall, f, lkvangr, and, those, who, die, from, disease, or, old, age, go, to, a, realm, known, as, hel, it, was, here, that, baldr, went, after, his, death, the, concept, of, hel, as, an, afterlife, location, never, appears, in, pagan, era, skaldic, poetry, where, hel, always, references, the, eponymous, goddess, snorri, also, mentions, the, possibility, of, the, dead, reaching, the, hall, of, brimir, in, giml, or, the, hall, of, sindri, in, the, ni, afj, ll, mountains, various, sagas, and, the, eddic, poem, helgakvi, a, hundingsbana, ii,

saga, and, eyrbyggja, saga, connections, are, drawn, between, pagan, burials, and, hauntings, in, mythological, accounts, the, deity, most, closely, associated, with, death, is, o, inn, in, particular, he, is, connected, with, death, by, hanging, this, is, apparent, in, h, vam, l, a, poem, found, in, the, poetic, edda, in, stanza, 138, of, h, vam, l, o, inn, describes, his, self, sacrifice, in, which, he, hangs, himself, on, yggdrasill, the, world, tree, for, nine, nights, to, attain, wisdom, and, magical, powers, in, the, late, gautreks, saga, king, v, karr, is, hanged, and, then, punctured, by, a, spear, his, executioner, says, now, i, give, you, to, o, inn, textual, accounts, suggest, a, spectrum, of, rituals, from, large, public, events, to, more, frequent, private, and, family, rites, which, would, have, been, interwoven, with, daily, life, however, written, sources, are, vague, about, norse, rituals, and, many, are, invisible, to, us, now, even, with, the, assistance, of, archaeology, sources, mention, some, rituals, addressed, to, particular, deities, but, the, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, old, norse, ritual, and, myth, remains, speculative, the, primary, religious, ritual, in, norse, religion, appears, to, have, been, sacrifice, or, bl, t, many, texts, both, old, norse, and, others, refer, to, sacrifices, the, saga, of, h, kon, the, good, in, heimskringla, states, that, there, were, obligatory, bl, ts, at, which, animals, were, slaughtered, and, their, blood, called, hlaut, sprinkled, on, the, altars, and, the, inside, and, outside, walls, of, the, temple, and, ritual, toasts, were, drunk, during, the, ensuing, sacrificial, feast, the, cups, were, passed, over, the, fire, and, they, and, the, food, were, consecrated, with, a, ritual, gesture, by, the, chieftain, king, h, kon, a, christian, was, forced, to, participate, but, made, the, sign, of, the, cross, the, description, of, the, temple, at, uppsala, in, adam, of, bremen, s, history, includes, an, account, of, a, festival, every, nine, years, at, which, nine, males, of, every, kind, of, animal, were, sacrificed, and, the, bodies, hung, in, the, temple, grove, there, may, have, been, many, methods, of, sacrifice, several, textual, accounts, refer, to, the, body, or, head, of, the, slaughtered, animal, being, hung, on, a, pole, or, tree, in, addition, to, seasonal, festivals, an, animal, bl, t, could, take, place, for, example, before, duels, after, the, conclusion, of, business, between, traders, before, sailing, to, ensure, favourable, winds, and, at, funerals, remains, of, animals, from, many, species, have, been, found, in, graves, from, the, old, norse, period, and, ibn, fadlan, s, account, of, a, ship, burial, includes, the, sacrifice, of, a, dog, draft, animals, cows, a, rooster, and, a, hen, as, well, as, that, of, a, servant, girl, in, the, eddic, poem, hyndlulj, freyja, expresses, appreciation, for, the, many, sacrifices, of, oxen, made, to, her, by, her, acolyte, ttar, in, hrafnkels, saga, hrafnkell, is, called, freysgo, i, for, his, many, sacrifices, to, freyr, there, may, also, be, markers, by, which, we, can, distinguish, sacrifices, to, odin, who, was, associated, with, hanging, and, some, texts, particularly, associate, the, ritual, killing, of, a, boar, with, sacrifices, to, freyr, but, in, general, archaeology, is, unable, to, identify, the, deity, to, whom, a, sacrifice, was, made, the, texts, frequently, allude, to, human, sacrifice, temple, wells, in, which, people, were, sacrificially, drowned, are, mentioned, in, adam, of, bremen, s, account, of, uppsala, and, in, icelandic, sagas, where, they, are, called, bl, tkelda, or, bl, tgr, f, and, adam, of, bremen, also, states, that, human, victims, were, included, among, those, hanging, in, the, trees, at, uppsala, in, gautreks, saga, people, sacrifice, themselves, during, a, famine, by, jumping, off, cliffs, and, both, the, historia, norwegi, and, heimskringla, refer, to, the, willing, death, of, king, d, maldi, as, a, sacrifice, after, bad, harvests, mentions, of, people, being, sentenced, to, sacrifice, and, of, the, wrath, of, the, gods, against, criminals, suggest, a, sacral, meaning, for, the, death, penalty, in, landnamab, k, the, method, of, execution, is, given, as, having, the, back, broken, on, a, rock, it, is, possible, that, some, of, the, bog, bodies, recovered, from, peat, bogs, in, northern, germany, and, denmark, and, dated, to, the, iron, age, were, human, sacrifices, such, a, practice, may, have, been, connected, to, the, execution, of, criminals, or, of, prisoners, of, war, and, tacitus, also, states, that, such, type, of, execution, was, used, as, a, punishment, for, the, coward, the, unwarlike, and, the, man, stained, with, abominable, vices, for, the, reason, that, these, were, considered, infamies, that, ought, to, be, buried, out, of, sight, on, the, other, hand, some, textual, mentions, of, a, person, being, offered, to, a, deity, such, as, a, king, offering, his, son, may, refer, to, a, non, sacrificial, dedication, archaeological, evidence, supports, ibn, fadlan,

birka, a, decapitated, young, man, was, placed, atop, an, older, man, buried, with, weapons, and, at, gerdrup, near, roskilde, a, woman, was, buried, alongside, a, man, whose, neck, had, been, broken, many, of, the, details, of, ibn, fadlan, s, account, are, born, out, by, archaeology, and, it, is, possible, that, those, elements, which, are, not, visible, in, the, archaeological, evidence, such, as, the, sexual, encounters, are, also, accurate, deposition, of, artefacts, in, wetlands, was, a, practice, in, scandinavia, during, many, periods, of, prehistory, in, the, early, centuries, of, the, common, era, huge, numbers, of, destroyed, weapons, were, placed, in, wetlands, mostly, spears, and, swords, but, also, shields, tools, and, other, equipment, beginning, in, the, 5th, century, the, nature, of, the, wetland, deposits, changed, in, scandinavia, fibulae, and, bracteates, were, placed, in, or, beside, wetlands, from, the, 5th, to, the, mid, 6th, centuries, and, again, beginning, in, the, late, 8th, century, when, weapons, as, well, as, jewellery, coins, and, tools, again, began, to, be, deposited, the, practice, lasting, until, the, early, 11th, century, this, practice, extended, to, non, scandinavian, areas, inhabited, by, norse, people, for, example, in, britain, a, sword, tools, and, the, bones, of, cattle, horses, and, dogs, were, deposited, under, a, jetty, or, bridge, over, the, river, hull, the, precise, purposes, of, such, depositions, are, unclear, it, is, harder, to, find, ritualised, deposits, on, dry, land, however, at, lunda, meaning, grove, near, str, ngn, s, in, s, dermanland, archaeological, evidence, has, been, found, at, a, hill, of, presumably, ritual, activity, from, the, 2nd, century, bce, until, the, 10th, century, ce, including, deposition, of,

icelandic, family, sagas, the, old, norse, word, br, hlaup, has, cognates, in, many, other, germanic, languages, and, means, bride, run, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, indicates, a, tradition, of, bride, stealing, but, other, scholars, including, jan, de, vries, interpreted, it, as, indicating, a, rite, of, passage, conveying, the, bride, from, her, birth, family, to, that, of, her, new,

etymologically, connected, to, old, norse, v, rar, vows, burial, of, the, dead, is, the, norse, rite, of, passage, about, which, we, have, most, archaeological, evidence, there, is, considerable, variation, in, burial, practices, both, spatially, and, chronologically, which, suggests, a, lack, of, dogma, about, funerary, rites, both, cremations, and, inhumations, are, found, throughout,

both, inhumation, and, cremation, burials, these, often, consist, of, animal, remains, for, instance, in, icelandic, pagan, graves, the, remains, of, dogs, and, horses, are, the, most, common, grave,

reported, of, sei, r, and, sp, ceremonies, and, shamanism, the, historian, of, religion, dag, str, mb, ck, regarded, it, as, a, borrowing, from, sami, or, balto, finnic, shamanic, traditions, but, there, are, also, differences, from, the, recorded, practices, of, sami, noaidi, since, the, 19th, century, some, scholars, have, sought, to, interpret, other, aspects, of, old, norse, religion, itself, by, comparison, with, shamanism, for, example, odin, s, self, sacrifice, on, the, world, tree, has, been, compared, to, finno, ugric, shamanic, practices, however, the, scholar, jan, de, vries, regarded, sei, r, as, an, indigenous, shamanic, development, among, the, norse, and, the, applicability, of, shamanism, as, a, framework, for, interpreting, old, norse, practices, even, sei, r,

of, a, deity, and, for, example, at, lilla, ullevi, compounded, with, the, name, of, the, god, ullr, in, bro, parish, uppland, sweden, archaeologists, have, found, a, stone, covered, ritual, area, at, which, offerings, including, silver, objects, rings, and, a, meat, fork, had, been, deposited, place, name, evidence, suggests, that, cultic, practices, might, also, take, place, at, many, different, kinds, of, sites, including, fields, and, meadows, vangr, vin, rivers, lakes, and, bogs, groves, lundr, and, individual, trees, and, rocks, some, icelandic, sagas, mention, sacred, places, in, both, landn, mab, k, and, eyrbyggja, saga, members, of, a, family, who, particularly, worshipped, thor, are, said, to, have, passed, after, death, into, the, mountain, helgafell, holy, mountain, which, was, not, to, be, defiled, by, bloodshed, or, excrement, or, even, to, be, looked, at, without, washing, first, mountain, worship, is, also, mentioned, in, landn, mab, k, as, an, old, norwegian, tradition, to, which, au, r, the, deepminded, s, family, reverted, after, she, died, the, scholar, hilda, ellis, davidson, regarded, it, as, associated, particularly, with, the, worship, of, thor, in, v, ga, gl, ms, saga, the, field, vitazgjafi, certain, giver, is, associated, with, freyr, and, similarly, not, to, be, defiled, the, scholar, stefan, brink, has, argued, that, one, can, speak, of, a, mythical, and, sacral, geography, in, pre, christian, scandinavia, several, of, the, sagas, refer, to, cult, houses, or, temples, generally, called, in, old, norse, by, the, term, hof, there, are, detailed, descriptions, of, large, temples, including, a, separate, area, with, images, of, gods, and, the, sprinkling, of, sacrificial, blood, using, twigs, like, the, christian, use, of, the, aspergillum, in, kjalnesinga, saga, and, eyrbyggja, saga, snorri, s, description, of, bl, t, in, heimskringla, adds, more, details, about, the, blood, sprinkling, adam, of, bremen, s, 11th, century, latin, history, describes, at, length, a, great, temple, at, uppsala, at, which, human, sacrifices, regularly, took, place, and, containing, statues, of, thor, wotan, and, frikko, presumably, freyr, a, scholion, adds, the, detail, that, a, golden, chain, hung, from, the, eaves, these, details, appear, exaggerated, and, probably, indebted, to, christian, churches, and, in, the, case, of, uppsala, to, the, biblical, description, of, solomon, s, temple, based, on, the, dearth, of, archaeological, evidence, for, dedicated, cult, houses, particularly, under, early, church, buildings, in, scandinavia, where, they, were, expected, to, be, found, and, additionally, on, tacitus, statement, in, germania, that, the, germanic, tribes, did, not, confine, their, deities, to, buildings, many, scholars, have, believed, hofs, to, be, largely, a, christian, idea, of, pre, christian, practice, in, 1966, based, on, the, results, of, a, comprehensive, archaeological, survey, of, most, of, scandinavia, the, danish, archaeologist, olaf, olsen, proposed, the, model, of, the, temple, farm, that, rather, than, the, hof, being, a, dedicated, building, a, large, longhouse, especially, that, of, the, most, prominent, farmer, in, the, district, served, as, the, location, for, community, cultic, celebrations, when, required, since, olsen, s, survey, however, archaeological, evidence, of, temple, buildings, has, come, to, light, in, scandinavia, although, sune, lindqvist, s, interpretation, of, post, holes, which, he, found, under, the, church, at, gamla, uppsala, as, the, remains, of, an, almost, square, building, with, a, high, roof, was, wishful, thinking, excavations, nearby, in, the, 1990s, uncovered, both, a, settlement, and, a, long, building, which, may, have, been, either, a, longhouse, used, seasonally, as, a, cult, house, or, a, dedicated, hof, the, building, site, at, hofsta, ir, near, m, vatn, in, iceland, which, was, a, particular, focus, of, olsen, s, work, has, since, been, re, excavated, and, the, layout, of, the, building, and, further, discoveries, of, the, remains, of, ritually, slaughtered, animals, now, suggest, that, it, was, a, cult, house, until, ritually, abandoned, other, buildings, that, have, been, interpreted, as, cult, houses, have, been, found, at, borg, in, sterg, tland, lunda, in, s, dermanland, and, uppakra, in, scania, remains, of, one, pagan, temple, have, so, far, been, found, under, a, medieval, church, at, m, re, in, nord, tr, ndelag, norway, in, norway, the, word, hof, appears, to, have, replaced, older, terms, referring, to, outdoor, cult, sites, during, the, viking, age, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, use, of, cult, buildings, was, introduced, into, scandinavia, starting, in, the, 3rd, century, based, on, the, christian, churches, then, proliferating, in, the, roman, empire, as, part, of, a, range, of, political, and, religious, changes, that, nordic, society, was, then, experiencing, some, of, the, cult, houses, which, have, been, found, are, located, within, what, archaeologists, call, central, places, settlements, with, various, religious, political, judicial, and, mercantile, functions, a, number, of, these, central, places, have, place, names, with, cultic, associations, such, as, gudme, home, of, gods, v, v, and, helg, holy, island, some, archaeologists, have, argued, that, they, were, designed, to, mirror, old, norse, cosmology, thus, connecting, ritual, practices, with, wider, worldviews, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, professional, priesthood, among, the, norse, and, rather, cultic, activities, were, carried, out, by, members, of, the, community, who, also, had, other, social, functions, and, positions, in, old, norse, society, religious, authority, was, harnessed, to, secular, authority, there, was, no, separation, between, economic, political, and, symbolic, institutions, both, the, norwegian, kings, sagas, and, adam, of, bremen, s, account, claim, that, kings, and, chieftains, played, a, prominent, role, in, cultic, sacrifices, in, medieval, iceland, the, go, i, was, a, social, role, that, combined, religious, political, and, judicial, functions, responsible, for, serving, as, a, chieftain, in, the, district, negotiating, legal, disputes, and, maintaining, order, among, his, ingmenn, most, evidence, suggests, that, public, cultic, activity, was, largely, the, preserve, of, high, status, males, in, old, norse, society, however, there, are, exceptions, the, landn, mab, k, refers, to, two, women, holding, the, position, of, gy, ja, both, of, whom, were, members, of, local, chiefly, families, in, ibn, fadlan, s, account, of, the, rus, he, describes, an, elder, woman, known, as, the, angel, of, death, who, oversaw, a, funerary, ritual, among, scholars, there, has, been, much, debate, as, to, whether, sacral, kingship, was, practised, among, old, norse, communities, in, which, the, monarch, was, endowed, with, a, divine, status, and, thus, responsible, for, ensuring, that, a, community, s, needs, were, met, through, supernatural, means, evidence, for, this, has, been, cited, from, the, ynglingatal, poem, in, which, the, swedes, kill, their, king, domalde, following, a, famine, however, interpretations, of, this, event, other, than, sacral, kingship, are, possible, for, instance, domalde, may, have, been, killed, in, a, political, coup, the, most, widespread, religious, symbol, in, the, viking, age, old, norse, religion, was, mj, llnir, the, hammer, of, thor, this, symbol, first, appears, in, the, ninth, century, and, might, be, a, conscious, response, to, the, symbolism, of, the, christian, cross, although, found, across, the, viking, world, mj, llnir, pendants, are, most, commonly, found, in, graves, from, modern, denmark, south, eastern, sweden, and, southern, norway, their, wide, distribution, suggests, the, particular, popularity, of, thor, when, found, in, inhumation, graves, mj, llnir, pendants, are, more, likely, to, be, found, in, women, s, graves, than, men, s, earlier, examples, were, made, from, iron, bronze, or, amber, although, silver, pendants, became, fashionable, in, the, tenth, century, this, may, have, been, a, response, to, the, growing, popularity, of, christian, cross, amulets, the, two, religious, symbols, may, have, co, existed, closely, one, piece, of, archaeological, evidence, suggesting, that, this, is, the, case, is, a, soapstone, mould, for, casting, pendants, discovered, from, treng, rden, in, denmark, this, mould, had, space, for, a, mj, llnir, and, a, crucifix, pendant, side, by, side, suggesting, that, the, artisan, who, produced, these, pendants, catered, for, both, religious, communities, these, have, typically, been, interpreted, as, a, protective, symbol, although, may, also, have, had, associations, with, fertility, being, worn, as, amulets, good, luck, charms, or, sources, of, protection, however, around, 10, per, cent, of, those, discovered, during, excavation, had, been, placed, on, top, of, cremation, urns, suggesting, that, they, had, a, place, in, certain, funerary, rituals, gods, and, goddesses, were, depicted, through, figurines, pendants, fibulas, and, as, images, on, weapons, thor, is, usually, recognised, in, depictions, by, his, carrying, of, mj, llnir, iconographic, material, suggesting, other, deities, are, less, common, than, those, connected, to, thor, some, pictorial, evidence, most, notably, that, of, the, picture, stones, intersects, with, the, mythologies, recorded, in, later, texts, these, picture, stones, produced, in, mainland, scandinavia, during, the, viking, age, are, the, earliest, known, visual, depictions, of, norse, mythological, scenes, it, is, nevertheless, unclear, what, function, these, picture, stones, had, or, what, they, meant, to, the, communities, who, produced, them, o, inn, has, been, identified, on, various, gold, bracteates, produced, from, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, some, figurines, have, been, interpreted, as, depictions, of, deities, the, lindby, image, from, sk, ne, sweden, is, often, interpreted, as, o, inn, because, of, its, missing, eye, the, bronze, figurine, from, eyrarland, in, iceland, as, thor, because, it, holds, a, hammer, a, bronze, figurine, from, r, llinge, in, s, dermanland, has, been, attributed, to, freyr, because, it, has, a, big, phallus, and, a, silver, pendant, from, aska, in, sterg, tland, has, been, seen, as, freya, because, it, wears, a, necklace, that, could, be, brisingamen, another, image, that, recurs, in, norse, artwork, from, this, period, is, the, valknut, the, term, is, modern, not, old, norse, these, symbols, may, have, a, specific, association, with, o, inn, because, they, often, accompany, images, of, warriors, on, picture, stones, during, the, romanticist, movement, of, the, 19th, century, various, northern, europeans, took, an, increasing, interest, in, old, norse, religion, seeing, in, it, ancient, pre, christian, mythology, that, provided, an, alternative, to, the, dominant, classical, mythology, as, a, result, artists, featured, norse, gods, and, goddesses, in, their, paintings, and, sculptures, and, their, names, were, applied, to, streets, squares, journals, and, companies, throughout, parts, of, northern, europe, the, mythological, stories, derived, from, old, norse, and, other, germanic, sources, inspired, various, artists, including, richard, wagner, who, used, these, narratives, as, the, basis, for, his, der, ring, des, nibelungen, also, inspired, by, these, old, norse, and, germanic, tales, was, j, r, r, tolkien, who, used, them, in, creating, his, legendarium, the, fictional, universe, in, which, he, set, novels, like, the, lord, of, the, rings, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, elements, of, old, norse, and, other, germanic, religions, were, adopted, by, nazi, germany, since, the, fall, of, the, nazis, various, right, wing, groups, continue, to, use, elements, of, old, norse, and, germanic, religion, in, their, symbols, names, and, references, some, neo, nazi, groups, for, instance, use, mj, llnir, as, a, symbol, theories, about, a, shamanic, component, of, old, norse, religion, have, been, adopted, by, forms, of, nordic, neoshamanism, groups, practising, what, they, called, sei, r, was, established, in, europe, and, the, united, states, by, the, 1990s, research, into, old, norse, religion, has, been, interdisciplinary, involving, historians, archaeologists, philologists, place, name, scholars, literary, scholars, and, historians, of, religion, scholars, from, different, disciplines, have, tended, to, take, different, approaches, to, the, material, for, instance, many, literary, scholars, have, been, highly, sceptical, about, how, accurately, old, norse, text, portrays, pre, christian, religion, whereas, historians, of, religion, have, tended, to, regard, these, portrayals, as, highly, accurate, interest, in, norse, mythology, was, revived, in, the, eighteenth, century, and, scholars, turned, their, attention, to, it, in, the, early, 19th, century, since, this, research, appeared, from, the, background, of, european, romanticism, many, of, the, scholars, operating, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, framed, their, approach, through, nationalism, and, were, strongly, influenced, by, their, interpretations, by, romantic, notions, about, nationhood, conquest, and, religion, their, understanding, of, cultural, interaction, was, also, coloured, by, 19th, century, european, colonialism, and, imperialism, many, regarded, pre, christian, religion, as, singular, and, unchanging, directly, equated, religion, with, the, nation, and, projected, modern, national, borders, onto, the, viking, age, past, due, to, the, use, of, old, norse, and, germanic, iconography, by, the, nazis, academic, research, into, old, norse, religion, reduced, heavily, following, the, second, world, war, scholarly, interest, in, the, subject, then, revived, in, the, late, 20th, century, by, the, 21st, century, old, norse, religion, was, regarded, as, one, of, the, best, known, non, christian, religions, from, europe, alongside, that, of, greece, and, rome
