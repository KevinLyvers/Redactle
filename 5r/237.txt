https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming
the, second, coming, sometimes, called, the, second, advent, or, the, parousia, is, the, christian, muslim, belief, that, jesus, christ, will, return, to, earth, after, his, ascension, to, heaven, which, is, said, to, have, occurred, about, two, thousand, years, ago, the, idea, is, based, on, messianic, prophecies, and, is, part, of, most, christian, eschatologies, other, faiths, have, various, interpretations, of, it, several, different, terms, are, used, to, refer, to, the, second, coming, of, christ, in, the, new, testament, the, greek, word, epiphaneia, appearing, is, used, six, times, to, refer, to, the, return, of, christ, the, greek, new, testament, uses, the, greek, term, parousia, meaning, arrival, coming, or, presence, 24, times, seventeen, of, them, concerning, christ, however, parousia, has, the, distinct, reference, to, a, period, of, time, rather, than, an, instant, in, time, at, matthew, 24, 37, the, word, parousia, is, used, to, clearly, describe, the, period, of, time, in, which, noah, lived, the, greek, word, eleusi, s, which, means, coming, is, not, interchangeable, with, parousia, so, this, parousia, or, presence, would, be, unique, and, distinct, from, anything, that, had, occurred, before, the, word, is, also, used, six, times, referring, to, individuals, stephanas, fortunatus, and, achaicus, titus, and, paul, the, apostle, and, once, referring, to, the, coming, of, the, lawless, one, gustav, adolf, deissmann, 1908, showed, that, the, greek, word, parousia, occurred, as, early, as, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, describe, the, visit, of, a, king, or, dignitary, to, a, city, a, visit, arranged, in, order, to, show, the, visitor, s, magnificence, to, the, people, in, islam, the, term, raj, a, arabic, romanized, al, raj, ah, lit, return, refers, to, the, second, coming, the, term, is, most, commonly, used, by, shia, muslims, views, about, the, nature, of, the, second, coming, vary, among, christian, denominations, and, among, individual, christians, many, specific, dates, have, been, predicted, for, the, second, coming, some, now, in, the, distant, past, others, still, in, the, future, most, english, versions, of, the, nicene, creed, include, the, following, statements, he, ascended, into, heaven, and, is, seated, at, the, right, hand, of, the, father, he, will, come, again, in, his, glory, to, judge, the, living, and, the, dead, and, his, kingdom, will, have, no, end, we, look, for, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, and, the, life, of, the, world, to, come, a, 2010, survey, showed, that, about, 40, of, americans, believe, that, jesus, is, likely, to, return, by, 2050, this, varies, from, 58, of, white, evangelical, christians, through, 32, of, catholics, to, 27, of, white, mainline, protestants, belief, in, the, second, coming, was, popularised, in, the, us, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, by, the, evangelist, dwight, l, moody, and, the, premillennial, interpretation, became, one, of, the, core, components, of, christian, fundamentalism, in, the, 1920s, jesus, told, his, disciples, truly, i, tell, you, this, generation, will, certainly, not, pass, away, until, all, these, things, have, happened, heaven, and, earth, will, pass, away, but, my, words, will, not, pass, away, the, most, common, english, translation, of, genea, is, generation, which, lead, some, to, conclude, that, the, second, coming, was, to, be, witnessed, by, the, people, living, in, the, same, generation, as, jesus, according, to, historian, charles, freeman, early, christians, expected, jesus, to, return, within, a, generation, of, his, death, and, the, non, occurrence, of, the, second, coming, surprised, them, n, t, wright, disputes, this, in, most, german, bibles, genea, is, instead, translated, as, family, lineage, geschlecht, likewise, for, danish, swedish, and, norwegian, sl, gt, sl, kte, and, slekt, respectively, the, danish, linguist, iver, larsen, argues, that, the, word, generation, as, it, was, used, in, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, 1611, had, a, wider, meaning, than, it, has, today, and, that, the, correct, translation, of, genea, in, the, context, of, the, second, coming, is, kind, of, people, specifically, the, good, kind, of, people, the, disciple, s, kind, of, people, who, like, the, words, of, jesus, will, endure, through, all, the, tribulations, in, psalm, 14, the, king, james, version, uses, generation, in, this, wide, and, outdated, sense, when, it, declares, that, god, is, in, the, generation, of, the, righteous, according, to, larsen, the, oxford, universal, dictionary, states, that, the, latest, attested, use, of, genea, in, the, sense, of, class, kind, or, set, of, persons, dates, from, 1727, larsen, concludes, that, the, meaning, of, generation, in, the, english, language, has, narrowed, considerably, since, then, bible, scholar, philip, la, grange, du, toit, argues, that, genea, is, mostly, used, to, describe, a, timeless, and, spiritual, family, lineage, of, good, or, bad, people, in, the, new, testament, and, that, this, is, the, case, also, for, the, second, coming, discourse, in, matthew, 24, in, contrast, to, larsen, however, he, argues, that, the, word, genea, here, denotes, the, bad, kind, of, people, because, jesus, had, used, the, word, in, that, pejorative, sense, in, the, preceding, context, chapter, 23, he, also, lists, the, main, competing, translation, alternatives, and, some, of, the, scholars, who, support, the, different, views, jesus, is, also, recorded, as, saying, there, are, some, standing, here, which, shall, not, taste, death, till, they, see, the, son, of, man, coming, in, his, kingdom, he, makes, similar, predictions, in, five, other, places, in, the, gospels, in, religious, sceptic, victor, j, stenger, s, view, when, the, coming, did, not, happen, within, the, life, times, of, his, disciples, christianity, changed, its, emphasis, to, the, resurrection, and, promise, of, eternal, life, a, competing, view, is, that, it, is, jesus, coming, in, power, on, the, mountain, that, provides, the, correct, interpretative, frame, for, the, not, taste, death, statement, the, author, of, second, peter, describes, the, event, for, we, did, not, follow, cleverly, devised, myths, when, we, made, known, to, you, the, power, and, coming, of, our, lord, jesus, christ, but, we, had, been, eyewitnesses, of, his, majesty, for, he, received, honor, and, glory, from, god, the, father, when, that, voice, was, conveyed, to, him, by, the, majestic, glory, saying, this, is, my, son, my, beloved, with, whom, i, am, well, pleased, we, ourselves, heard, this, voice, come, from, heaven, while, we, were, with, him, on, the, holy, mountain, the, position, associating, the, second, coming, with, 1st, century, events, such, as, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, and, of, the, jewish, temple, in, ad, 70, is, known, as, preterism, some, preterists, see, this, coming, of, the, son, of, man, in, glory, primarily, fulfilled, in, jesus, s, death, on, the, cross, they, believe, the, apocalyptic, signs, are, already, fulfilled, including, the, sun, will, be, dark, the, powers, will, be, shaken, and, then, they, will, see, yet, some, critics, note, that, many, are, missing, such, as, but, the, day, of, the, lord, will, come, as, a, thief, in, the, night, in, which, the, heavens, will, pass, away, with, a, great, noise, and, the, elements, will, melt, with, fervent, heat, both, the, earth, and, the, works, that, are, in, it, will, be, burned, up, and, then, the, sign, of, the, son, of, man, will, appear, in, heaven, and, then, all, the, tribes, of, the, earth, will, mourn, and, they, will, see, the, son, of, man, coming, on, the, clouds, of, heaven, with, power, and, great, glory, according, to, the, catholic, church, the, second, coming, will, happen, in, a, single, moment, suddenly, and, unexpectedly, not, even, the, angels, saints, or, demons, know, when, it, will, occur, it, will, cause, the, fullness, of, the, reign, of, god, and, the, consummation, of, the, universe, and, mankind, the, fullness, of, the, reign, of, god, means, god, fully, manifests, the, victory, he, won, over, his, enemies, sin, suffering, and, satan, on, the, cross, just, as, god, gradually, revealed, himself, to, israel, until, the, birth, of, jesus, so, also, god, gradually, manifests, his, victory, through, the, church, s, sacraments, baptism, forgiving, sin, exorcising, satan, holy, unction, relieving, suffering, etc, until, the, moment, when, he, will, fully, manifest, his, victory, through, the, consummation, of, the, universe, and, mankind, e, g, by, granting, the, universe, and, mankind, a, share, in, jesus, resurrection, the, universe, being, transfigured, and, the, dead, being, resurrected, judged, and, recompensed, the, church, does, not, believe, the, second, coming, will, happen, via, a, catastrophe, such, as, a, nuclear, war, or, extinction, event, reincarnation, such, as, someone, claiming, to, be, jesus, social, or, technological, progress, such, as, mankind, abolishing, slavery, or, curing, disease, or, ascendancy, such, as, the, church, having, political, power, nor, does, the, church, believe, in, double, predestination, at, the, moment, of, jesus, arrival, three, events, will, happen, all, at, once, in, an, instant, in, the, blink, of, an, eye, the, living, will, die, the, universe, will, be, transfigured, and, the, dead, will, be, resurrected, judged, and, recompensed, after, this, single, instant, or, moment, the, church, does, not, know, what, will, happen, for, the, rest, of, eternity, only, that, the, damned, will, continue, to, be, in, hell, and, the, saved, will, continue, to, experience, the, beatific, vision, the, second, coming, is, suspended, until, jesus, is, recognized, by, all, of, israel, and, it, will, be, followed, by, a, final, and, ultimate, temptation, to, sin, in, this, case, apostasy, caused, by, the, antichrist, yet, there, are, three, things, that, hasten, the, second, coming, the, celebration, of, the, eucharist, christians, living, with, the, mind, of, jesus, and, christians, praying, for, the, second, coming, like, many, christian, denominations, the, church, considers, this, second, coming, of, christ, to, be, the, final, and, eternal, judgment, by, god, of, the, people, in, every, nation, resulting, in, the, glorification, of, some, and, the, punishment, of, others, the, concept, is, found, in, all, the, canonical, gospels, particularly, the, gospel, of, matthew, a, decisive, factor, in, this, last, judgment, during, the, second, coming, of, christ, will, be, the, question, of, whether, the, corporal, and, spiritual, works, of, mercy, were, practised, or, not, during, lifetime, they, rate, as, important, acts, of, mercy, charity, and, justice, therefore, and, according, to, the, biblical, sources, matthew, 25, 31, 46, the, conjunction, of, the, last, judgment, and, the, works, of, mercy, is, very, frequent, in, the, pictorial, tradition, of, christian, art, it, is, the, traditional, view, of, orthodox, christians, preserved, from, the, early, church, that, the, second, coming, will, be, a, sudden, and, unmistakable, incident, like, a, flash, of, lightning, they, hold, the, general, view, that, jesus, will, not, spend, any, time, on, the, earth, in, ministry, or, preaching, but, come, to, judge, mankind, they, teach, that, the, ministry, of, the, antichrist, will, take, place, right, before, the, second, coming, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, a, part, of, the, oriental, orthodox, communion, of, churches, teaches, that, the, second, coming, of, jesus, will, be, radically, different, from, his, first, coming, which, was, to, save, the, lost, world, orthodox, layman, alexander, kalomiros, explains, the, original, church, s, position, regarding, the, second, coming, in, river, of, fire, and, against, false, union, stating, that, those, who, contend, that, christ, will, reign, on, earth, for, a, thousand, years, do, not, wait, for, christ, but, for, the, antichrist, the, idea, of, jesus, returning, to, this, earth, as, a, king, is, a, heretical, concept, to, the, church, equated, to, the, expectations, of, the, jews, who, wanted, the, messiah, to, be, an, earthly, king, the, church, instead, teaches, that, which, it, has, taught, since, the, beginning, a, reference, to, the, second, coming, is, contained, in, the, nicene, creed, and, apostles, creed, which, is, recited, during, the, lutheran, and, anglican, liturgies, he, shall, come, again, in, glory, to, judge, the, living, and, the, dead, and, his, kingdom, shall, have, no, end, an, analogous, statement, is, also, in, the, biblical, pauline, creed, 1, corinthians, 15, 23, the, lutheran, and, anglican, churches, proclaim, the, mystery, of, faith, in, their, liturgies, christ, has, died, christ, is, risen, christ, will, come, again, methodist, denominations, teach, that, the, second, coming, is, connected, with, the, last, judgment, as, professed, in, the, creeds, methodist, denominations, differ, on, the, nature, of, the, second, coming, for, example, the, united, methodist, church, does, not, teach, that, there, will, be, a, rapture, on, the, other, hand, the, evangelical, methodist, church, conference, teaches, with, regard, to, the, second, coming, of, christ, we, believe, that, the, coming, of, our, lord, is, to, be, personal, and, pre, millenial, also, that, it, is, imminent, we, must, distinguish, between, the, rapture, his, coming, in, the, air, to, receive, his, saints, which, may, occur, at, any, moment, and, the, revelation, his, coming, down, to, earth, with, his, saints, the, latter, of, which, will, not, occur, until, after, the, gathering, of, israel, the, manifestation, of, antichrist, and, other, prophesied, events, ezek, 36, 24, 37, 21, matt, 24, 27, 25, 13, 26, 29, acts, 1, 9, 11, i, thess, 4, 14, 17, ii, thess, 2, 8, 10, rev, 19, 20, 20, 4, 22, 12, the, standard, works, of, the, largest, denomination, in, the, latter, day, saint, movement, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, say, that, christ, will, return, as, stated, in, the, bible, they, also, teach, that, when, the, savior, comes, again, he, will, come, in, power, and, glory, to, claim, the, earth, as, his, kingdom, his, second, coming, will, mark, the, beginning, of, the, millennium, the, second, coming, will, be, a, fearful, mournful, time, for, the, wicked, but, it, will, be, a, day, of, peace, for, the, righteous, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, and, its, leaders, do, not, make, predictions, of, the, actual, date, of, the, second, coming, mormons, believe, jesus, appeared, to, his, new, world, disciples, in, the, americas, sometime, after, his, crucifixion, this, is, a, central, tenet, of, the, religion, latter, day, saints, have, particularly, distinct, and, specific, interpretations, of, what, are, considered, to, be, signs, stated, in, the, book, of, revelation, according, to, the, teachings, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, restored, gospel, will, be, taught, in, all, parts, of, the, world, prior, to, the, second, coming, church, members, believe, that, there, will, be, increasingly, severe, wars, earthquakes, hurricanes, and, other, man, made, and, natural, disasters, prior, to, the, second, coming, fundamental, belief, 25, of, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, states, the, second, coming, of, christ, is, the, blessed, hope, of, the, church, the, grand, climax, of, the, gospel, the, saviour, s, coming, will, be, literal, personal, visible, and, worldwide, when, he, returns, the, righteous, dead, will, be, resurrected, and, together, with, the, righteous, living, will, be, glorified, and, taken, to, heaven, but, the, unrighteous, will, die, the, almost, complete, fulfillment, of, most, lines, of, prophecy, together, with, the, present, condition, of, the, world, indicates, that, christ, s, coming, is, imminent, the, time, of, that, event, has, not, been, revealed, and, we, are, therefore, exhorted, to, be, ready, at, all, times, jehovah, s, witnesses, rarely, use, the, term, second, coming, preferring, the, term, presence, as, a, translation, of, parousia, they, believe, that, jesus, comparison, of, the, presence, of, the, son, of, man, with, the, days, of, noah, at, matthew, 24, 37, 39, and, luke, 17, 26, 30, suggests, a, duration, rather, than, a, moment, of, arrival, they, also, believe, that, biblical, chronology, points, to, 1914, as, the, start, of, christ, s, presence, which, continues, until, the, final, battle, of, armageddon, other, biblical, expressions, they, correlate, with, this, period, include, the, time, of, the, end, daniel, 12, 4, the, conclusion, of, the, system, of, things, matthew, 13, 40, 49, 24, 3, and, the, last, days, 2, timothy, 3, 1, 2, peter, 3, 3, witnesses, believe, christ, s, millennial, reign, begins, after, armageddon, emanuel, swedenborg, an, 18th, century, scientist, turned, theologian, taught, that, his, time, that, historians, have, called, the, age, of, enlightenment, was, an, age, of, darkness, and, doubt, for, the, christian, church, historian, marguerite, beck, block, writes, now, therefore, it, was, time, for, a, new, church, to, be, founded, upon, the, earth, and, for, this, purpose, it, was, necessary, for, the, lord, himself, to, make, his, second, coming, to, the, sons, of, men, the, night, is, followed, by, a, morning, which, is, the, coming, of, the, lord, the, prevailing, opinion, in, the, churches, at, the, present, day, is, that, when, the, lord, shall, come, for, the, last, judgment, he, will, appear, in, the, clouds, of, heaven, with, angels, and, the, sound, of, trumpets, etc, but, this, opinion, is, erroneous, the, second, coming, of, the, lord, is, not, a, coming, in, person, but, in, spirit, and, in, the, word, which, is, from, him, and, is, himself, heretofore, it, has, not, been, known, that, the, clouds, of, heaven, mean, the, word, in, the, sense, of, the, letter, and, that, the, glory, and, power, in, which, he, is, then, to, come, mean, the, spiritual, sense, of, the, word, because, no, one, as, yet, has, had, the, least, conjecture, that, there, is, a, spiritual, sense, in, the, word, such, as, this, sense, is, in, itself, but, as, the, lord, has, now, opened, to, me, the, spiritual, sense, of, the, word, and, has, granted, me, to, be, associated, with, angels, and, spirits, in, their, world, as, one, of, them, it, is, now, disclosed, this, second, coming, of, the, lord, is, effected, by, means, of, a, man, to, whom, the, lord, has, manifested, himself, in, person, and, whom, he, has, filled, with, his, spirit, that, he, may, teach, the, doctrines, of, the, new, church, from, the, lord, by, means, of, the, word, that, the, lord, manifested, himself, before, me, his, servant, and, sent, me, to, this, office, i, affirm, in, truth, in, max, heindel, s, teaching, there, is, a, distinction, between, the, cosmic, christ, or, christ, without, and, the, christ, within, according, to, this, tradition, the, christ, within, is, regarded, as, the, true, saviour, who, needs, to, be, born, within, each, individual, in, order, to, evolve, toward, the, future, sixth, epoch, in, the, earth, s, etheric, plane, that, is, toward, the, new, heavens, and, a, new, earth, the, new, galilee, the, second, coming, or, advent, of, the, christ, is, not, in, a, physical, body, but, in, the, new, soul, body, of, each, individual, in, the, etheric, plane, of, the, planet, where, man, shall, be, caught, up, in, the, clouds, to, meet, the, lord, in, the, air, the, day, and, hour, of, this, event, is, not, known, the, esoteric, christian, tradition, teaches, that, first, there, will, be, a, preparatory, period, as, the, sun, enters, aquarius, an, astrological, concept, by, precession, the, coming, age, of, aquarius, in, islam, jesus, or, isa, arabic, s, is, considered, to, be, a, messenger, of, god, and, the, masih, messiah, who, was, sent, to, guide, ban, isr, l, the, israelites, with, a, new, scripture, the, inj, l, gospel, the, belief, in, jesus, and, all, other, messengers, of, god, is, required, in, islam, and, a, requirement, of, being, a, muslim, however, muslims, believe, that, jesus, was, never, crucified, or, resurrected, instead, ascending, directly, into, heaven, additionally, they, do, not, recognize, jesus, as, the, son, of, god, as, they, believe, god, has, no, equals, but, rather, that, he, was, a, prophet, the, quran, states, that, jesus, was, born, of, the, virgin, mary, muslims, believe, that, jesus, performed, all, the, miracles, in, the, gospels, with, god, s, permission, the, pertinent, verses, in, sura, an, nisa, 4, 157, reads, and, for, their, saying, indeed, we, have, killed, the, messiah, jesus, the, son, of, mary, the, messenger, of, allah, and, they, did, not, kill, him, nor, did, they, crucify, him, but, another, was, made, to, resemble, him, to, them, and, indeed, those, who, differ, over, it, are, in, doubt, about, it, they, have, no, knowledge, of, it, except, the, following, of, assumption, and, they, did, not, kill, him, for, certain, 4, 158, continues, rather, allah, raised, him, to, himself, and, ever, is, allah, exalted, in, might, and, wise, the, quran, refers, to, a, conversation, between, jesus, and, god, on, judgement, day, in, sura, al, ma, idah, 5, 116, 5, 117, jesus, is, questioned, 5, 116, did, you, ever, ask, the, people, to, worship, you, and, your, mother, as, gods, besides, allah, to, which, jesus, replies, 5, 117, i, never, told, them, anything, except, what, you, ordered, me, to, say, worship, allah, my, lord, and, your, lord, and, i, was, witness, over, them, as, long, as, i, remained, among, them, and, on, judgment, day, allah, will, say, o, jesus, son, of, mary, did, you, ever, ask, the, people, to, worship, you, and, your, mother, as, gods, besides, allah, he, will, answer, glory, be, to, you, how, could, i, ever, say, what, i, had, no, right, to, say, if, i, had, said, such, a, thing, you, would, have, certainly, known, it, you, know, what, is, hidden, within, me, but, i, do, not, know, what, is, within, you, indeed, you, alone, are, the, knower, of, all, unseen, 5, 116, i, never, told, them, anything, except, what, you, ordered, me, to, say, worship, allah, my, lord, and, your, lord, and, i, was, witness, over, them, as, long, as, i, remained, among, them, but, when, you, took, me, you, were, the, witness, over, them, and, you, are, a, witness, over, all, things, 5, 117, in, the, quran, the, second, coming, of, jesus, is, heralded, in, sura, az, zukhruf, as, a, sign, of, the, day, of, judgment, and, jesus, shall, be, a, sign, for, the, coming, of, the, hour, of, judgment, therefore, have, no, doubt, about, the, hour, but, follow, ye, me, this, is, a, straight, way, 43, 61, ibn, kathir, presents, this, verse, as, proof, of, jesus, second, coming, in, the, quran, in, his, exegesis, tafsir, al, qur, an, al, azim, there, are, also, hadiths, that, foretell, jesus, future, return, such, as, sahih, al, bukhari, volume, 3, book, 43, kitab, ul, ilm, book, of, knowledge, hadith, number, 656, allah, s, apostle, said, the, hour, will, not, be, established, until, the, son, of, mary, i, e, jesus, descends, amongst, you, as, a, just, ruler, he, will, break, the, cross, kill, the, pigs, and, abolish, the, jizya, tax, money, will, be, in, abundance, so, that, nobody, will, accept, it, as, charitable, gifts, according, to, islamic, tradition, jesus, descent, will, be, in, the, midst, of, wars, fought, by, the, mahdi, lit, the, rightly, guided, one, known, in, islamic, eschatology, as, the, redeemer, of, islam, against, the, al, masih, ad, dajjal, literally, the, false, messiah, synonymous, with, the, antichrist, and, his, followers, jesus, will, descend, at, the, point, of, a, white, arcade, east, of, damascus, dressed, in, saffron, robes, his, head, anointed, he, will, then, join, the, mahdi, in, his, war, against, the, dajjal, jesus, considered, in, islam, as, a, muslim, one, who, submits, to, god, and, one, of, god, s, messengers, will, abide, by, the, islamic, teachings, eventually, jesus, will, slay, the, antichrist, dajjal, and, then, everyone, from, the, people, of, the, book, ahl, al, kit, b, referring, to, jews, and,

years, after, which, he, will, die, since, according, to, islam, jesus, did, not, die, on, the, cross, but, was, taken, up, to, heaven, and, continues, to, live, until, his, return, in, the, second, coming, muslims, will, then, perform, the, salat, al, janazah, funeral, prayer, for, him, and, bury, him, in, the, city, of, medina, in, a, grave, left, vacant, beside, muhammad, the, ahmadiyya, movement, believe, that, the, promised, mahdi, and, messiah, arrived, in, the, person, of, mirza, ghulam, ahmad, 1835, 1908, this, is, widely, rejected, by, other, muslims, who, do, not, regard, ahmadis, as, a, legitimate, sect, of, islam, the, ahmadiyya, movement, interpret, the, second, coming, of, jesus, prophesied, as, being, that, of, a, person, similar, to, jesus, math, l, i, is, and, not, his, physical, return, in, the, same, way, as, john, the, baptist, resembled, the, character, of, the, biblical, prophet, elijah, in, christianity, ahmadis, believe, that, mirza, ghulam, ahmad, the, founder, of, the, movement, demonstrated, that, the, prophecy, in, muslim, and, christian, religious, texts, were, traditionally, misunderstood, to, suggest, that, jesus, of, nazareth, himself, would, return, and, hold, that, jesus, survived, the, crucifixion, and, later, died, a, natural, death, ahmadis, consider, ghulam, in, both, his, character, and, teachings, to, be, representative, of, jesus, and, that, he, attained, the, same, spiritual, rank, of, prophethood, as, jesus, thus, ahmadis, believe, this, prediction, was, fulfilled, and, continued, by, his, movement, according, to, the, bah, faith, the, second, coming, is, a, gradual, process, that, coincides, with, the, advancement, of, human, civilization, from, the, beginning, of, humanity, it, teaches, that, the, founders, of, the, major, world, religions, each, represent, a, return, of, the, word, and, spirit, of, god, as, a, new, unique, personification, sent, by, god, who, introduces, new, teachings, laws, and, revelations, such, that, all, major, religions, are, part, of, a, progressive, revelation, each, coming, is, said, to, build, upon, the, major, world, religions, emerging, from, earlier, ages, verifying, previous, spiritual, truths, and, fulfilling, its, prophesies, regarding, a, future, return, or, coming, in, this, context, the, second, coming, is, depicted, as, a, continuation, of, god, s, will, in, one, continuous, faith, with, different, names, as, presented, by, the, founders, of, each, religion, as, the, voice, of, god, at, different, times, in, history, bah, u, ll, h, announced, that, he, was, a, manifestation, of, the, returned, christ, understood, as, a, reappearance, of, the, word, and, spirit, of, god, o, thou, who, art, waiting, tarry, no, longer, for, he, is, come, behold, his, tabernacle, and, his, glory, dwelling, therein, it, is, the, ancient, glory, with, a, new, manifestation, he, wrote, to, pope, pius, ix, he, who, is, the, lord, of, lords, is, come, overshadowed, with, clouds, he, verily, hath, again, come, down, from, heaven, even, as, he, came, down, from, it, the, first, time, beware, that, thou, dispute, not, with, him, even, as, the, pharisees, disputed, with, him, without, a, clear, token, or, proof, he, referred, to, himself, as, the, ancient, of, days, and, the, pen, of, glory, and, also, claimed, this, is, the, father, foretold, by, isaiah, and, the, comforter, concerning, whom, the, spirit, had, covenanted, with, you, open, your, eyes, o, concourse, of, bishops, that, ye, may, behold, your, lord, seated, upon, the,

from, us, whereat, the, eye, of, my, loving, kindness, wept, sore, over, my, people, followers, of, the, bah, faith, believe, that, prophecies, of, the, second, coming, of, jesus, along, with, prophecies, from, other, religions, were, fulfilled, by, his, forerunner, the, b, b, in, 1844, and, then, by, the, events, occurring, during, the, days, of, bah, u, ll, h, they, believe, that, the, fulfillment, of, christian, prophecies, by, baha, u, llah, is, similar, to, jesus, fulfillment, of, jewish, prophecies, where, in, both, cases, people, were, expecting, the, literal, fulfillment, of, apocalyptic, statements, that, led, to, rejections, of, the, return, instead, of, accepting, fulfillment, in, symbolic, and, spiritual, ways, bah, s, understand, that, the, return, of, the, christ, with, a, new, name, was, intended, by, jesus, to, be, a, return, in, a, spiritual, sense, due, to, jesus, explaining, in, the, gospels, that, the, return, of, elijah, in, john, the, baptist, was, a, return, in, a, spiritual, sense, judaism, teaches, that, jesus, is, one, of, the, false, jewish, messiah, claimants, because, he, failed, to, fulfill, any, messianic, prophecies, which, include, regarding, the, christian, idea, that, these, prophecies, will, be, fulfilled, during, a, second, coming, ohr, samayach, states, we, find, this, to, be, a, contrived, answer, since, there, is, no, mention, of, a, second, coming, in, the, jewish, bible, second, why, couldn, t, god, accomplish, his, goals, the, first, time, round, rabbi, david, wolpe, believes, that, the, second, coming, was,

second, coming, of, christ, it, was, claimed, that, marcus, garvey, preached, the, coming, of, the, black, messiah, on, the, eve, of, selassie, s, coronation, due, to, this, prophecy, selassie, was, the, source, of, inspiration, of, the, poor, and, uneducated, christian, populations, of, jamaica, who, believed, that, the, emperor, would, liberate, the, black, people, from, the, subjugation, of, european, colonists, in, modern, times, some, traditional, indian, religious, leaders, have, moved, to, embrace, jesus, as, an, avatar, or, incarnation, of, god, in, light, of, this, the, indian,
