cremation, is, a, method, of, final, disposition, of, a, dead, body, through, burning, cremation, may, serve, as, a, funeral, or, post, funeral, rite, and, as, an, alternative, to, burial, in, some, countries, including, india, nepal, and, syria, cremation, on, an, open, air, pyre, is, an, ancient, tradition, starting, in, the, 19th, century, cremation, was, introduced, or, reintroduced, into, other, parts, of, the, world, in, modern, times, cremation, is, commonly, carried, out, with, a, closed, furnace, cremator, at, a, crematorium, cremation, leaves, behind, an, average, of, 2, 4, kg, 5, 3, lb, of, remains, known, as, ashes, or, cremains, this, is, not, all, ash, but, includes, unburnt, fragments, of, bone, mineral, which, are, commonly, ground, into, powder, they, are, inorganic, and, inert, and, thus, do, not, constitute, a, health, risk, and, may, be, buried, interred, in, a, memorial, site, retained, by, relatives, or, scattered, in, various, ways, cremation, dates, from, at, least, 17, 000, years, ago, in, the, archaeological, record, with, the, mungo, lady, the, remains, of, a, partly, cremated, body, found, at, lake, mungo, australia, alternative, death, rituals, which, emphasize, one, method, of, disposal, burial, cremation, or, exposure, have, gone, through, periods, of, preference, throughout, history, in, the, middle, east, and, europe, both, burial, and, cremation, are, evident, in, the, archaeological, record, in, the, neolithic, era, cultural, groups, had, their, own, preferences, and, prohibitions, the, ancient, egyptians, developed, an, intricate, transmigration, of, soul, theology, which, prohibited, cremation, this, was, also, widely, adopted, by, semitic, peoples, the, babylonians, according, to, herodotus, embalmed, their, dead, phoenicians, practiced, both, cremation, and, burial, from, the, cycladic, civilization, in, 3000, bce, until, the, sub, mycenaean, era, in, 1200, 1100, bce, greeks, practiced, burial, cremation, appeared, around, the, 12th, century, bce, probably, influenced, by, anatolia, until, the, christian, era, when, inhumation, again, became, the, only, burial, practice, both, combustion, and, inhumation, had, been, practiced, depending, on, the, era, and, location, in, rome, s, earliest, history, both, inhumation, and, cremation, were, in, common, use, among, all, classes, around, the, mid, republic, inhumation, was, almost, exclusively, replaced, by, cremation, with, some, notable, exceptions, and, remained, the, most, common, funerary, practice, until, the, middle, of, the, empire, when, it, was, almost, entirely, replaced, by, inhumation, in, europe, there, are, traces, of, cremation, dating, to, the, early, bronze, age, c, 2000, bce, in, the, pannonian, plain, and, along, the, middle, danube, the, custom, became, dominant, throughout, bronze, age, europe, with, the, urnfield, culture, from, c, 1300, bce, in, the, iron, age, inhumation, again, becomes, more, common, but, cremation, persisted, in, the, villanovan, culture, and, elsewhere, homer, s, account, of, patroclus, burial, describes, cremation, with, subsequent, burial, in, a, tumulus, similar, to, urnfield, burials, and, qualifying, as, the, earliest, description, of, cremation, rites, this, may, be, an, anachronism, as, during, mycenaean, times, burial, was, generally, preferred, and, homer, may, have, been, reflecting, the, more, common, use, of, cremation, at, the, time, the, iliad, was, written, centuries, later, criticism, of, burial, rites, is, a, common, aspersion, by, competing, religions, and, cultures, including, the, association, of, cremation, with, fire, sacrifice, or, human, sacrifice, hinduism, and, jainism, are, notable, for, not, only, allowing, but, prescribing, cremation, cremation, in, india, is, first, attested, in, the, cemetery, h, culture, from, c, 1900, bce, considered, the, last, phase, of, indus, valley, civilisation, and, beginning, of, the, vedic, civilization, the, rigveda, contains, a, reference, to, the, emerging, practice, in, rv, 10, 15, 14, where, the, forefathers, both, cremated, agnidagdh, and, uncremated, nagnidagdha, are, invoked, cremation, remained, common, but, not, universal, in, both, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, according, to, cicero, burial, was, considered, the, more, archaic, rite, in, rome, the, rise, of, christianity, saw, an, end, to, cremation, in, europe, though, it, may, have, already, been, in, decline, in, early, roman, britain, cremation, was, usual, but, diminished, by, the, 4th, century, it, then, reappeared, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, during, the, migration, era, when, sacrificed, animals, were, sometimes, included, on, the, pyre, and, the, dead, were, dressed, in, costume, and, with, ornaments, for, the, burning, that, custom, was, also, very, widespread, among, the, germanic, peoples, of, the, northern, continental, lands, from, which, the, anglo, saxon, migrants, are, supposed, to, have, been, derived, during, the, same, period, these, ashes, were, usually, thereafter, deposited, in, a, vessel, of, clay, or, bronze, in, an, urn, cemetery, the, custom, again, died, out, with, the, christian, conversion, of, the, anglo, saxons, or, early, english, during, the, 7th, century, when, christian, burial, became, general, in, parts, of, europe, cremation, was, forbidden, by, law, and, even, punishable, by, death, if, combined, with, heathen, rites, cremation, was, sometimes, used, by, catholic, authorities, as, part, of, punishment, for, accused, heretics, which, included, burning, at, the, stake, for, example, the, body, of, john, wycliff, was, exhumed, years, after, his, death, and, burned, to, ashes, with, the, ashes, thrown, in, a, river, explicitly, as, a, posthumous, punishment, for, his, denial, of, the, roman, catholic, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, the, first, to, advocate, for, the, use, of, cremation, was, the, physician, sir, thomas, browne, in, urne, buriall, 1658, which, interpreted, cremation, as, means, of, oblivion, and, reveals, plainly, that, there, is, no, antidote, against, the, opium, of, time, honoretta, brooks, pratt, became, the, first, recorded, cremated, european, individual, in, modern, times, when, she, died, on, 26, september, 1769, and, was, illegally, cremated, at, the, burial, ground, on, hanover, square, in, london, in, europe, a, movement, to, reintroduce, cremation, as, a, viable, method, for, body, disposal, began, in, the, 1870s, this, was, made, possible, by, the, invention, of, new, furnace, technology, and, contact, with, eastern, cultures, that, practiced, it, at, the, time, many, proponents, believed, in, the, miasma, theory, and, that, cremation, would, reduce, the, bad, air, that, caused, diseases, these, movements, were, associated, with, secularism, and, gained, a, following, in, cultural, and, intellectual, circles, in, italy, the, movement, was, associated, with, anti, clericalism, and, freemasonry, whereas, these, were, not, major, themes, of, the, movement, in, britain, in, 1869, the, idea, was, presented, to, the, medical, international, congress, of, florence, by, professors, coletti, and, castiglioni, in, the, name, of, public, health, and, civilization, in, 1873, professor, paolo, gorini, of, lodi, and, professor, ludovico, brunetti, of, padua, published, reports, of, practical, work, they, had, conducted, a, model, of, brunetti, s, cremating, apparatus, together, with, the, resulting, ashes, was, exhibited, at, the, vienna, exposition, in, 1873, and, attracted, great, attention, meanwhile, sir, charles, william, siemens, had, developed, his, regenerative, furnace, in, the, 1850s, his, furnace, operated, at, a, high, temperature, by, using, regenerative, preheating, of, fuel, and, air, for, combustion, in, regenerative, preheating, the, exhaust, gases, from, the, furnace, are, pumped, into, a, chamber, containing, bricks, where, heat, is, transferred, from, the, gases, to, the, bricks, the, flow, of, the, furnace, is, then, reversed, so, that, fuel, and, air, pass, through, the, chamber, and, are, heated, by, the, bricks, through, this, method, an, open, hearth, furnace, can, reach, temperatures, high, enough, to, melt, steel, and, this, process, made, cremation, an, efficient, and, practical, proposal, charles, s, nephew, carl, friedrich, von, siemens, perfected, the, use, of, this, furnace, for, the, incineration, of, organic, material, at, his, factory, in, dresden, the, radical, politician, sir, charles, wentworth, dilke, took, the, corpse, of, his, dead, wife, there, to, be, cremated, in, 1874, the, efficient, and, cheap, process, brought, about, the, quick, and, complete, incineration, of, the, body, and, was, a, fundamental, technical, breakthrough, that, finally, made, industrial, cremation, a, practical, possibility, the, first, crematorium, in, the, western, world, opened, in, milan, in, 1876, milan, s, crematorium, temple, was, built, in, the, monumental, cemetery, the, building, still, stands, but, ceased, to, be, operational, in, 1992, sir, henry, thompson, 1st, baronet, a, surgeon, and, physician, to, the, queen, victoria, had, seen, gorini, s, cremator, at, the, vienna, exhibition, and, had, returned, home, to, become, the, first, and, chief, promoter, of, cremation, in, england, his, main, reason, for, supporting, cremation, was, that, it, was, becoming, a, necessary, sanitary, precaution, against, the, propagation, of, disease, among, a, population, daily, growing, larger, in, relation, to, the, area, it, occupied, in, addition, he, believed, cremation, would, prevent, premature, burial, reduce, the, expense, of, funerals, spare, mourners, the, necessity, of, standing, exposed, to, the, weather, during, interment, and, urns, would, be, safe, from, vandalism, he, joined, with, other, proponents, to, form, the, cremation, society, of, great, britain, in, 1874, they, founded, the, united, kingdom, s, first, crematorium, in, woking, with, gorini, travelling, to, england, to, assist, the, installation, of, a, cremator, they, first, tested, it, on, 17, march, 1879, with, the, body, of, a, horse, after, protests, and, an, intervention, by, the, home, secretary, sir, richard, cross, their, plans, were, put, on, hold, in, 1884, the, welsh, neo, druidic, priest, william, price, was, arrested, and, put, on, trial, for, attempting, to, cremate, his, son, s, body, price, successfully, argued, in, court, that, while, the, law, did, not, state, that, cremation, was, legal, it, also, did, not, state, that, it, was, illegal, the, case, set, a, precedent, that, allowed, the, cremation, society, to, proceed, in, 1885, the, first, official, cremation, in, the, united, kingdom, took, place, in, woking, the, deceased, was, jeanette, pickersgill, a, well, known, figure, in, literary, and, scientific, circles, by, the, end, of, the, year, the, cremation, society, of, great, britain, had, overseen, 2, more, cremations, a, total, of, 3, out, of, 597, 357, deaths, in, the, uk, that, year, in, 1888, 28, cremations, took, place, at, the, venue, in, 1891, woking, crematorium, added, a, chapel, pioneering, the, concept, of, a, crematorium, being, a, venue, for, funerals, as, well, as, cremation, other, early, crematoria, in, europe, were, built, in, 1878, in, the, town, of, gotha, in, germany, and, later, in, heidelberg, in, 1891, the, first, modern, crematory, in, the, u, s, was, built, in, 1876, by, francis, julius, lemoyne, after, hearing, about, its, use, in, europe, like, many, early, proponents, he, was, motivated, by, a, belief, it, would, be, beneficial, for, public, health, before, lemoyne, s, crematory, closed, in, 1901, it, had, performed, 42, cremations, other, countries, that, opened, their, first, crematorium, included, sweden, 1887, in, stockholm, switzerland, 1889, in, zurich, and, france, 1889, in, p, re, lachaise, paris, some, of, the, various, protestant, churches, came, to, accept, cremation, in, anglican, and, nordic, protestant, countries, cremation, gained, acceptance, though, it, did, not, yet, become, the, norm, first, by, the, higher, classes, and, cultural, circles, and, then, by, the, rest, of, the, population, in, 1905, westminster, abbey, interred, ashes, for, the, first, time, by, 1911, the, abbey, was, expressing, a, preference, for, interring, ashes, the, 1908, catholic, encyclopedia, was, critical, of, the, development, referring, to, them, as, a, sinister, movement, and, associating, them, with, freemasonry, although, it, said, that, there, is, nothing, directly, opposed, to, any, dogma, of, the, church, in, the, practice, of, cremation, in, the, u, s, only, about, one, crematory, per, year, was, built, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, embalming, became, more, widely, accepted, and, used, crematories, lost, their, sanitary, edge, not, to, be, left, behind, crematories, had, an, idea, of, making, cremation, beautiful, they, started, building, crematories, with, stained, glass, windows, and, marble, floors, with, frescoed, walls, australia, also, started, to, establish, modern, cremation, movements, and, societies, australians, had, their, first, purpose, built, modern, crematorium, and, chapel, in, the, west, terrace, cemetery, in, the, south, australian, capital, of, adelaide, in, 1901, this, small, building, resembling, the, buildings, at, woking, remained, largely, unchanged, from, its, 19th, century, style, and, was, in, full, operation, until, the, late, 1950s, the, oldest, operating, crematorium, in, australia, is, at, rookwood, cemetery, in, sydney, it, opened, in, 1925, in, the, netherlands, the, foundation, of, the, association, for, optional, cremation, in, 1874, ushered, in, a, long, debate, about, the, merits, and, demerits, of, cremation, laws, against, cremation, were, challenged, and, invalidated, in, 1915, two, years, after, the, construction, of, the, first, crematorium, in, the, netherlands, though, cremation, did, not, become, legally, recognised, until, 1955, during, world, war, ii, 1939, 45, nazi, germany, used, specially, built, furnaces, in, at, least, six, extermination, camps, throughout, occupied, poland, including, at, auschwitz, birkenau, che, mno, belzec, majdanek, sobibor, and, treblinka, where, the, bodies, of, those, murdered, by, gassing, were, disposed, of, using, incineration, the, efficiency, of, industrialised, killing, of, operation, reinhard, during, the, most, deadly, phase, of, the, holocaust, produced, too, many, corpses, therefore, the, crematoria, manufactured, to, ss, specifications, were, put, into, use, in, all, of, them, to, handle, the, disposals, around, the, clock, day, and, night, the, vrba, wetzler, report, offers, the, following, description, at, present, there, are, four, crematoria, in, operation, at, b, irkenau, two, large, ones, i, and, ii, and, two, smaller, ones, iii, and, iv, those, of, type, i, and, ii, consist, of, 3, parts, i, e, a, the, furnace, room, b, the, large, halls, and, c, the, gas, chamber, a, huge, chimney, rises, from, the, furnace, room, around, which, are, grouped, nine, furnaces, each, having, four, openings, each, opening, can, take, three, normal, corpses, at, once, and, after, an, hour, and, a, half, the, bodies, are, completely, burned, this, corresponds, to, a, daily, capacity, of, about, 2, 000, bodies, crematoria, iii, and, iv, work, on, nearly, the, same, principle, but, their, capacity, is, only, half, as, large, thus, the, total, capacity, of, the, four, cremating, and, gassing, plants, at, b, irkenau, amounts, to, about, 6, 000, daily, the, holocaust, furnaces, were, supplied, by, a, number, of, manufacturers, with, the, best, known, and, most, common, being, topf, and, sons, as, well, as, kori, company, of, berlin, whose, ovens, were, elongated, to, accommodate, two, bodies, slid, inside, from, the, back, side, the, ashes, were, taken, out, from, the, front, side, in, the, 20th, century, cremation, gained, varying, degrees, of, acceptance, in, most, christian, denominations, william, temple, the, most, senior, bishop, in, the, church, of, england, was, cremated, after, his, death, in, office, in, 1944, the, roman, catholic, church, accepted, the, practice, more, slowly, in, 1963, at, the, second, vatican, council, pope, paul, vi, lifted, the, ban, on, cremation, and, in, 1966, allowed, catholic, priests, to, officiate, at, cremation, ceremonies, this, is, done, on, the, condition, that, the, ashes, must, be, buried, or, interred, not, scattered, many, countries, where, burial, is, traditional, saw, cremation, rise, to, become, a, significant, if, not, the, most, common, way, of, disposing, of, a, dead, body, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, there, was, an, unprecedented, phase, of, crematorium, construction, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, netherlands, starting, in, the, 1960s, cremation, has, become, more, common, than, burial, in, several, countries, where, the, latter, is, traditional, this, has, included, the, united, kingdom, 1968, czechoslovakia, 1980, canada, early, 2000s, the, united, states, 2016, and, finland, 2017, factors, cited, include, cheaper, costs, especially, a, factor, after, the, 2008, recession, growth, in, secular, attitudes, and, declining, opposition, in, some, christian, denominations, the, cremation, occurs, in, a, cremator, which, is, located, at, a, crematorium, or, crematory, in, many, countries, the, crematorium, is, a, venue, for, funerals, as, well, as, cremation, a, cremator, is, an, industrial, furnace, that, is, able, to, generate, temperatures, of, 871, 982, c, 1, 600, 1, 800, f, to, ensure, the, disintegration, of, the, corpse, modern, cremator, fuels, include, oil, natural, gas, propane, and, in, hong, kong, coal, gas, modern, cremators, automatically, monitor, their, interior, to, tell, when, the, cremation, process, is, complete, and, have, a, spyhole, so, that, an, operator, can, see, inside, the, time, required, for, cremation, varies, from, body, to, body, with, the, average, being, 90, minutes, for, an, adult, body, the, chamber, where, the, body, is, placed, is, called, a, cremation, chamber, or, retort, and, is, lined, with, heat, resistant, refractory, bricks, refractory, bricks, are, designed, in, several, layers, the, outermost, layer, is, usually, simply, an, insulation, material, e, g, mineral, wool, inside, is, typically, a, layer, of, insulation, brick, mostly, calcium, silicate, in, nature, heavy, duty, cremators, are, usually, designed, with, two, layers, of, fire, bricks, inside, the, insulation, layer, the, layer, of, fire, bricks, in, contact, with, the, combustion, process, protects, the, outer, layer, and, must, be, replaced, from, time, to, time, the, body, is, generally, required, to, be, inside, a, coffin, or, a, combustible, container, this, allows, the, body, to, be, quickly, and, safely, slid, into, the, cremator, it, also, reduces, health, risks, to, the, operators, the, coffin, or, container, is, inserted, charged, into, the, cremator, as, quickly, as, possible, to, avoid, heat, loss, some, crematoria, allow, relatives, to, view, the, charging, this, is, sometimes, done, for, religious, reasons, such, as, in, traditional, hindu, and, jain, funerals, and, is, also, customary, in, japan, in, the, united, states, federal, law, does, not, dictate, any, container, requirements, for, cremation, certain, states, require, an, opaque, or, non, transparent, container, for, all, cremations, this, can, be, a, simple, corrugated, cardboard, box, or, a, wooden, casket, coffin, another, option, is, a, cardboard, box, that, fits, inside, a, wooden, shell, which, is, designed, to, look, like, a, traditional, casket, after, the, funeral, service, the, box, is, removed, from, the, shell, before, cremation, permitting, the, shell, to, be, re, used, in, the, united, kingdom, the, body, is, not, removed, from, the, coffin, and, is, not, placed, into, a, container, as, described, above, the, body, is, cremated, with, the, coffin, which, is, why, all, british, coffins, that, are, to, be, used, for, cremation, must, be, combustible, the, code, of, cremation, practice, forbids, the, opening, of, the, coffin, once, it, has, arrived, at, the, crematorium, and, rules, stipulate, that, it, must, be, cremated, within, 72, hours, of, the, funeral, service, therefore, in, the, united, kingdom, bodies, are, cremated, in, the, same, coffin, that, they, are, placed, in, at, the, undertaker, s, although, the, regulations, allow, the, use, of, an, approved, cover, during, the, funeral, service, it, is, recommended, that, jewellery, be, removed, before, the, coffin, is, sealed, for, this, reason, when, cremation, is, finished, the, remains, are, passed, through, a, magnetic, field, to, remove, any, metal, which, will, be, interred, elsewhere, in, the, crematorium, grounds, or, increasingly, recycled, the, ashes, are, entered, into, a, cremulator, to, further, grind, the, remains, down, into, a, finer, texture, before, being, given, to, relatives, or, loved, ones, or, scattered, in, the, crematorium, grounds, where, facilities, exist, in, germany, the, process, is, mostly, similar, to, that, of, the, united, kingdom, the, body, is, cremated, in, the, coffin, a, piece, of, fire, clay, with, a, number, on, it, is, used, for, identifying, the, remains, of, the, dead, body, after, burning, the, remains, are, then, placed, in, a, container, called, an, ash, capsule, which, generally, is, put, into, a, cinerary, urn, in, australia, reusable, or, cardboard, coffins, are, rare, with, only, a, few, manufacturers, now, supplying, them, for, low, cost, a, plain, particle, board, coffin, known, in, the, trade, as, a, chippie, shipper, or, pyro, can, be, used, handles, if, fitted, are, plastic, and, approved, for, use, in, a, cremator, cremations, can, be, delivery, only, with, no, preceding, chapel, service, at, the, crematorium, although, a, church, service, may, have, been, held, or, preceded, by, a, service, in, one, of, the, crematorium, chapels, delivery, only, allows, crematoria, to, schedule, cremations, to, make, best, use, of, the, cremators, perhaps, by, holding, the, body, overnight, in, a, refrigerator, allowing, a, lower, fee, to, be, charged, the, box, containing, the, body, is, placed, in, the, retort, and, incinerated, at, a, temperature, of, 760, to, 1, 150, c, 1, 400, to, 2, 100, f, during, the, cremation, process, the, greater, portion, of, the, body, especially, the, organs, and, other, soft, tissues, is, vaporized, and, oxidized, by, the, intense, heat, gases, released, are, discharged, through, the, exhaust, system, jewelry, such, as, necklaces, wrist, watches, and, rings, are, ordinarily, removed, before, cremation, and, returned, to, the, family, several, implanted, devices, are, required, to, be, removed, pacemakers, and, other, medical, devices, can, cause, large, dangerous, explosions, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, cremated, remains, are, not, ashes, in, the, usual, sense, after, the, incineration, is, completed, the, dry, bone, fragments, are, swept, out, of, the, retort, and, pulverised, by, a, machine, called, a, cremulator, essentially, a, high, capacity, high, speed, blender, to, process, them, into, ashes, or, cremated, remains, although, pulverisation, may, also, be, performed, by, hand, this, leaves, the, bone, with, a, fine, sand, like, texture, and, color, able, to, be, scattered, without, need, for, mixing, with, any, foreign, matter, though, the, size, of, the, grain, varies, depending, on, the, cremulator, used, the, mean, weight, of, an, adult, s, remains, is, 2, 4, kg, 5, 3, lb, the, mean, weight, for, adult, males, is, about, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, higher, than, that, for, adult, females, there, are, various, types, of, cremulators, including, rotating, devices, grinders, and, older, models, using, heavy, metal, balls, the, grinding, process, typically, takes, about, 20, seconds, in, most, asian, countries, the, bones, are, not, pulverised, unless, requested, beforehand, when, not, pulverised, the, bones, are, collected, by, the, family, and, stored, as, one, might, do, with, ashes, the, appearance, of, cremated, remains, after, grinding, is, one, of, the, reasons, they, are, called, ashes, although, a, non, technical, term, sometimes, used, is, cremains, a, portmanteau, of, cremated, and, remains, the, cremation, association, of, north, america, prefers, that, the, word, cremains, not, be, used, for, referring, to, human, cremated, remains, the, reason, given, is, that, cremains, is, thought, to, have, less, connection, with, the, deceased, whereas, a, loved, one, s, cremated, remains, has, a, more, identifiable, human, connection, after, final, grinding, the, ashes, are, placed, in, a, container, which, can, be, anything, from, a, simple, cardboard, box, to, a, decorative, urn, the, default, container, used, by, most, crematoria, when, nothing, more, expensive, has, been, selected, is, usually, a, hinged, snap, locking, plastic, box, cremated, remains, are, mostly, dry, calcium, phosphates, with, some, minor, minerals, such, as, salts, of, sodium, and, potassium, sulfur, and, most, carbon, are, driven, off, as, oxidized, gases, during, the, process, although, about, 1, 4, of, carbon, remains, as, carbonate, the, ash, remaining, represents, very, roughly, 3, 5, of, the, body, s, original, mass, 2, 5, in, children, because, the, weight, of, dry, bone, fragments, is, so, closely, connected, to, skeletal, mass, their, weight, varies, greatly, from, person, to, person, because, many, changes, in, body, composition, such, as, fat, and, muscle, loss, or, gain, do, not, affect, the, weight, of, cremated, remains, the, weight, of, the, remains, can, be, more, closely, predicted, from, the, person, s, height, and, sex, which, predicts, skeletal, weight, than, it, can, be, predicted, from, the, person, s, simple, weight, ashes, of, adults, can, be, said, to, weigh, from, 876, to, 3, 784, g, 1, lb, 15, oz, to, 8, lb, 5, oz, with, women, s, ashes, generally, weighing, below, 2, 750, g, 6, lb, 1, oz, and, men, s, ashes, generally, weighing, above, 1, 887, g, 4, lb, 3, oz, bones, are, not, all, that, remain, after, cremation, there, may, be, melted, metal, lumps, from, missed, jewellery, casket, furniture, dental, fillings, and, surgical, implants, such, as, hip, replacements, breast, implants, do, not, have, to, be, removed, before, cremation, some, medical, devices, such, as, pacemakers, may, need, to, be, removed, before, cremation, to, avoid, the, risk, of, explosion, large, items, such, as, titanium, hip, replacements, which, tarnish, but, do, not, melt, or, casket, hinges, are, usually, removed, before, processing, as, they, may, damage, the, processor, if, they, are, missed, at, first, they, must, ultimately, be, removed, before, processing, is, complete, as, items, such, as, titanium, joint, replacements, are, far, too, durable, to, be, ground, implants, may, be, returned, to, the, family, but, are, more, commonly, sold, as, ferrous, non, ferrous, scrap, metal, after, the, remains, are, processed, smaller, bits, of, metal, such, as, tooth, fillings, and, rings, commonly, known, as, gleanings, are, sieved, out, and, may, be, later, interred, in, common, consecrated, ground, in, a, remote, area, of, the, cemetery, they, may, also, be, sold, as, precious, metal, scrap, cremated, remains, are, returned, to, the, next, of, kin, in, different, manners, according, to, custom, and, country, in, the, united, states, the, cremated, remains, are, almost, always, contained, in, a, thick, watertight, polyethylene, plastic, bag, contained, within, a, hard, snap, top, rectangular, plastic, container, which, is, labeled, with, a, printed, paper, label, the, basic, sealed, plastic, container, bag, may, be, contained, within, a, further, cardboard, box, or, velvet, sack, or, they, may, be, contained, within, an, urn, if, the, family, had, already, purchased, one, an, official, certificate, of, cremation, prepared, under, the, authority, of, the, crematorium, accompanies, the, remains, and, if, required, by, law, the, permit, for, disposition, of, human, remains, which, must, remain, with, the, cremated, remains, cremated, remains, can, be, kept, in, an, urn, stored, in, a, special, memorial, building, columbarium, buried, in, the, ground, at, many, locations, or, sprinkled, on, a, special, field, mountain, or, in, the, sea, in, addition, there, are, several, services, in, which, the, cremated, remains, will, be, scattered, in, a, variety, of, ways, and, locations, some, examples, are, via, a, helium, balloon, through, fireworks, shot, from, shotgun, shells, by, boat, or, scattered, from, an, aeroplane, one, service, sends, a, lipstick, tube, sized, sample, of, the, cremated, remains, into, low, earth, orbit, where, they, remain, for, years, but, not, permanently, before, reentering, the, atmosphere, some, companies, offer, a, service, to, turn, part, of, the, cremated, remains, into, synthetic, diamonds, which, can, then, be, made, into, jewelry, this, cremation, jewelry, is, also, known, as, funeral, jewelry, remembrance, jewelry, or, memorial, jewelry, a, portion, of, the, cremated, remains, may, be, retained, in, a, specially, designed, locket, known, as, cremation, jewelry, or, even, blown, into, special, glass, keepsakes, and, glass, orbs, cremated, remains, may, also, be, incorporated, with, urn, and, cement, into, part, of, an, artificial, reef, or, they, can, also, be, mixed, into, paint, and, made, into, a, portrait, of, the, deceased, some, individuals, use, a, very, small, amount, of, the, remains, in, tattoo, ink, for, remembrance, portraits, cremated, remains, can, be, scattered, in, national, parks, in, the, united, states, with, a, special, permit, they, can, also, be, scattered, on, private, property, with, the, permission, of, the, owner, the, cremated, remains, may, also, be, entombed, most, cemeteries, will, grant, permission, for, burial, of, cremated, remains, in, occupied, cemetery, plots, that, have, already, been, purchased, or, are, in, use, by, the, families, disposing, of, the, cremated, remains, without, any, additional, charge, or, oversight, ashes, are, alkaline, in, some, areas, such, as, snowdon, wales, environmental, authorities, have, warned, that, the, frequent, scattering, of, ashes, can, change, the, nature, of, the, soil, and, may, affect, the, ecology, the, final, disposition, depends, on, the, personal, preferences, of, the, deceased, as, well, as, their, cultural, and, religious, beliefs, some, religions, will, permit, the, cremated, remains, to, be, sprinkled, or, retained, at, home, some, religions, such, as, roman, catholicism, prefer, to, either, bury, or, entomb, the, remains, hinduism, obliges, the, closest, male, relative, son, grandson, etc, of, the, deceased, to, immerse, the, cremated, remains, in, the, holy, river, ganges, preferably, at, one, of, the, holy, cities, triveni, sangam, allahabad, varanasi, or, haridwar, in, india, the, sikhs, immerse, the, remains, in, the, sutlej, usually, at, kiratpur, sahib, in, southern, india, the, ashes, are, immersed, in, the, river, kaveri, at, paschima, vahini, in, srirangapattana, at, a, stretch, where, the, river, flows, from, east, to, west, depicting, the, life, of, a, human, being, from, sunrise, to, sunset, in, japan, and, taiwan, the, remaining, bone, fragments, are, given, to, the, family, and, are, used, in, a, burial, ritual, before, final, interment, aside, from, religious, reasons, discussed, below, some, people, find, they, prefer, cremation, over, traditional, burial, for, personal, reasons, the, thought, of, a, long, and, slow, decomposition, process, is, unappealing, to, some, many, people, find, that, they, prefer, cremation, because, it, disposes, of, the, body, relatively, quickly, other, people, view, cremation, as, a, way, of, simplifying, their, funeral, process, these, people, view, a, traditional, ground, burial, as, an, unneeded, complication, of, their, funeral, process, and, thus, choose, cremation, to, make, their, services, as, simple, as, possible, cremation, is, a, more, simple, disposition, method, to, plan, than, a, burial, funeral, this, is, because, with, a, burial, funeral, one, would, have, to, plan, for, more, transportation, services, for, the, body, as, well, as, embalming, and, other, body, preservation, methods, with, a, burial, funeral, one, will, also, have, to, purchase, a, casket, headstone, grave, plot, opening, and, closing, of, the, grave, fee, and, mortician, fees, cremation, funerals, only, require, planning, the, transportation, of, the, body, to, a, crematorium, cremation, of, the, body, and, a, cremation, urn, the, cost, factor, tends, to, make, cremation, attractive, generally, speaking, cremation, is, cheaper, than, a, traditional, burial, service, especially, if, direct, cremation, also, known, as, bare, cremation, is, chosen, in, which, the, body, is, cremated, as, soon, as, legally, possible, without, any, sort, of, services, for, some, even, cremation, is, still, relatively, expensive, especially, as, a, lot, of, fuel, is, required, to, perform, it, methods, to, reduce, fuel, consumption, fuel, cost, include, the, use, of, different, fuels, i, e, natural, gas, or, propane, compared, to, wood, and, by, using, an, incinerator, retort, closed, cabin, rather, than, an, open, fire, for, surviving, kin, cremation, is, preferred, because, of, simple, portability, survivors, relocating, to, another, city, or, country, have, the, option, of, transporting, the, remains, of, their, loved, ones, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, being, interred, or, scattered, together, despite, being, an, obvious, source, of, carbon, emissions, cremation, does, have, environmental, advantages, over, burial, depending, on, local, practice, studies, by, elisabeth, keijzer, for, the, netherlands, organisation, for, applied, research, found, that, cremation, has, less, of, an, environmental, impact, than, a, traditional, burial, the, study, did, not, address, natural, burials, while, the, newer, method, of, alkaline, hydrolysis, sometimes, called, green, cremation, or, resomation, had, less, impact, than, both, the, study, was, based, on, dutch, practice, american, crematoria, are, more, likely, to, emit, mercury, but, are, less, likely, to, burn, hardwood, coffins, keijzer, s, studies, also, found, that, a, cremation, or, burial, accounts, for, only, about, a, quarter, of, a, funeral, s, environmental, impact, the, carbon, emissions, of, people, travelling, to, the, funeral, are, far, greater, each, cremation, requires, about, 110, l, 28, us, gal, of, fuel, and, releases, about, 240, kg, 540, lb, of, carbon, dioxide, into, the, atmosphere, thus, the, roughly, 1, million, bodies, that, are, cremated, annually, in, the, united, states, produce, about, 240, 000, t, 270, 000, short, tons, of, carbon, dioxide, which, is, more, co, 2, pollution, than, 22, 000, average, american, homes, generate, in, a, year, the, environmental, impact, may, be, reduced, by, using, cremators, for, longer, periods, and, relaxing, the, requirement, for, a, cremation, to, take, place, on, the, same, day, that, the, coffin, is, received, which, reduces, the, use, of, fossil, fuel, and, hence, carbon, emissions, cremation, is, therefore, becoming, more, friendly, toward, the, environment, some, funeral, and, crematorium, owners, offer, a, carbon, neutral, funeral, service, incorporating, efficient, burning, coffins, made, from, lightweight, recycled, composite, board, burial, is, a, known, source, of, certain, environmental, contaminants, with, the, major, ones, being, formaldehyde, and, the, coffin, itself, cremation, can, also, release, contaminants, such, as, mercury, from, dental, fillings, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, the, law, now, requires, that, cremators, be, fitted, with, abatement, equipment, filters, that, remove, serious, pollutants, such, as, mercury, another, environmental, concern, is, that, traditional, burial, takes, up, a, great, deal, of, space, in, a, traditional, burial, the, body, is, buried, in, a, casket, made, from, a, variety, of, materials, in, the, united, states, the, casket, is, often, placed, inside, a, concrete, vault, or, liner, before, burial, in, the, ground, while, individually, this, may, not, take, much, room, combined, with, other, burials, it, can, over, time, cause, serious, space, concerns, many, cemeteries, particularly, in, japan, and, europe, as, well, as, those, in, larger, cities, have, run, out, of, permanent, space, in, tokyo, for, example, traditional, burial, plots, are, extremely, scarce, and, expensive, and, in, london, a, space, crisis, led, harriet, harman, to, propose, reopening, old, graves, for, double, decker, burials, some, cities, in, germany, do, not, have, plots, for, sale, only, for, lease, when, the, lease, expires, the, remains, are, disinterred, and, a, specialist, bundles, the, bones, inscribes, the, forehead, of, the, skull, with, the, information, that, was, on, the, headstone, and, places, the, remains, in, a, special, crypt, in, singapore, cremation, is, preferred, by, most, singaporeans, because, burial, there, is, limited, to, 15, years, in, christian, countries, and, cultures, cremation, has, historically, been, discouraged, and, viewed, as, a, desecration, of, god, s, image, and, as, interference, with, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, taught, in, scripture, it, is, now, acceptable, to, some, denominations, since, a, literal, interpretation, of, scripture, is, less, common, in, modern, reformist, traditions, christians, preferred, to, bury, the, dead, rather, than, to, cremate, the, remains, as, was, common, in, roman, culture, the, early, church, carried, on, judaism, s, respect, for, the, human, body, as, being, created, in, god, s, image, and, followed, their, practices, of, speedy, interment, in, hopes, of, the, future, resurrection, of, all, dead, the, roman, catacombs, and, medieval, veneration, of, relics, of, roman, catholic, saints, witness, to, this, preference, for, them, the, body, was, not, a, mere, receptacle, for, a, spirit, that, was, the, real, person, but, an, integral, part, of, the, human, person, they, looked, on, the, body, as, sanctified, by, the, sacraments, and, itself, the, temple, of, the, holy, spirit, and, thus, requiring, to, be, disposed, of, in, a, way, that, honours, and, reveres, it, and, they, saw, many, early, practices, involved, with, disposal, of, dead, bodies, as, pagan, in, origin, or, an, insult, to, the, body, the, idea, that, cremation, might, interfere, with, god, s, ability, to, resurrect, the, body, was, refuted, by, the, 2nd, century, octavius, of, minucius, felix, in, which, he, said, every, body, whether, it, is, dried, up, into, dust, or, is, dissolved, into, moisture, or, is, compressed, into, ashes, or, is, attenuated, into, smoke, is, withdrawn, from, us, but, it, is, reserved, for, god, in, the, custody, of, the, elements, nor, as, you, believe, do, we, fear, any, loss, from, sepulture, but, we, adopt, the, ancient, and, better, custom, of, burying, in, the, earth, a, similar, practice, of, boiling, to, remove, flesh, from, bones, was, also, punished, with, excommunication, in, a, 1300, decree, of, pope, boniface, viii, and, while, there, was, a, clear, and, prevailing, preference, for, burial, there, was, no, general, church, law, forbidding, cremation, until, 1866, in, medieval, europe, cremation, was, practiced, mainly, in, situations, where, there, were, multitudes, of, corpses, simultaneously, present, such, as, after, a, battle, after, a, pestilence, or, famine, and, where, there, was, an, imminent, fear, of, diseases, spreading, from, the, corpses, since, individual, burials, with, digging, graves, would, take, too, long, and, body, decomposition, would, begin, before, all, the, corpses, had, been, interred, beginning, in, the, middle, ages, and, even, more, so, in, the, 18th, century, and, later, non, christian, rationalists, and, classicists, began, to, advocate, cremation, again, as, a, statement, denying, the, resurrection, and, or, the, afterlife, although, the, pro, cremation, movement, often, took, care, to, address, these, concerns, sentiment, within, the, catholic, church, against, cremation, became, hardened, in, the, face, of, the, association, of, cremation, with, professed, enemies, of, god, when, masonic, groups, advocated, cremation, as, a, means, of, rejecting, christian, belief, in, the, resurrection, the, holy, see, forbade, catholics, to, practise, cremation, in, 1886, the, 1917, code, of, canon, law, incorporated, this, ban, in, 1963, recognizing, that, in, general, cremation, was, being, sought, for, practical, purposes, and, not, as, a, denial, of, bodily, resurrection, the, choice, of, cremation, was, permitted, in, some, circumstances, the, current, 1983, code, of, canon, law, states, the, church, earnestly, recommends, the, pious, custom, of, christian, burial, be, retained, but, it, does, not, entirely, forbid, cremation, except, if, this, is, chosen, for, reasons, which, are, contrary, to, christian, teaching, there, are, no, universal, rules, governing, catholic, funeral, rites, in, connection, with, cremation, but, episcopal, conferences, have, laid, down, rules, for, various, countries, of, these, perhaps, the, most, elaborate, are, those, established, with, the, necessary, confirmation, of, the, holy, see, by, the, united, states, conference, of, catholic, bishops, and, published, as, appendix, ii, of, the, united, states, edition, of, the, order, of, christian, funerals, although, the, holy, see, has, in, some, cases, authorized, bishops, to, grant, permission, for, funeral, rites, to, be, carried, out, in, the, presence, of, cremated, remains, it, is, preferred, that, the, rites, be, carried, out, in, the, presence, of, a, still, intact, body, practices, that, show, insufficient, respect, for, the, ashes, of, the, dead, such, as, turning, them, into, jewelry, or, scattering, them, are, forbidden, for, catholics, but, burial, on, land, or, sea, or, enclosing, in, a, niche, or, columbarium, is, now, acceptable, in, 1917, volume, 6, of, the, american, lutheran, survey, stated, that, the, lutheran, clergy, as, a, rule, refuse, and, that, episcopal, pastors, often, take, a, stand, against, it, indeed, in, the, 1870s, the, anglican, bishop, of, london, stated, that, the, practice, of, cremation, would, undermine, the, faith, of, mankind, in, the, doctrine, of, the, resurrection, of, the, body, hasten, rejection, of, a, scriptural, worldview, and, so, bring, about, a, most, disastrous, social, revolution, in, the, lutheran, pastor, george, henry, gerberding, stated, third, as, to, cremation, this, is, not, a, biblical, or, christian, mode, of, disposing, of, the, dead, the, old, and, new, testament, agree, and, take, for, granted, that, as, the, body, was, taken, originally, from, the, earth, so, it, is, to, return, to, the, earth, again, burial, is, the, natural, and, christian, mode, there, is, a, beautiful, symbolism, in, it, the, whole, terminology, of, eschatology, presupposes, it, cremation, is, purely, heathenish, it, was, the, main, practice, among, pagan, greeks, and, romans, the, majority, of, hindus, thus, dispose, of, their, dead, it, is, dishonoring, to, the, body, intended, as, a, temple, of, the, holy, ghost, and, to, bear, the, image, of, god, it, is, an, insidious, denial, of, the, doctrine, of, the, resurrection, some, protestant, churches, welcomed, the, use, of, cremation, at, a, much, earlier, date, than, the, catholic, church, pro, cremation, sentiment, was, not, unanimous, among, protestants, as, some, have, retained, a, literal, interpretation, of, scripture, the, first, crematoria, in, the, protestant, countries, were, built, in, the, 1870s, and, in, 1908, the, dean, and, chapter, of, westminster, abbey, one, of, the, most, famous, anglican, churches, required, that, remains, be, cremated, for, burial, in, the, abbey, s, precincts, today, scattering, or, strewing, is, an, acceptable, practice, in, some, protestant, denominations, and, some, churches, have, their, own, garden, of, remembrance, on, their, grounds, in, which, remains, can, be, scattered, some, denominations, like, lutheran, churches, in, scandinavia, favour, the, urns, being, buried, in, family, graves, a, family, grave, can, thus, contain, urns, of, many, generations, and, also, the, urns, of, spouses, and, loved, ones, an, 1898, methodist, tract, titled, immortality, and, resurrection, noted, that, burial, is, the, result, of, a, belief, in, the, resurrection, of, the, body, while, cremation, anticipates, its, annihilation, the, methodist, review, noted, in, 1874, that, three, thoughts, alone, would, lead, us, to, suppose, that, the, early, christians, would, have, special, care, for, their, dead, namely, the, essential, jewish, origin, of, the, church, the, mode, of, burial, of, their, founder, and, the, doctrine, of, the, resurrection, of, the, body, so, powerfully, urged, by, the, apostles, and, so, mighty, in, its, influence, on, the, primitive, christians, from, these, considerations, the, roman, custom, of, cremation, would, be, most, repulsive, to, the, christian, mind, since, at, least, 1992, the, united, methodist, church, does, not, have, a, specific, official, statement, that, either, endorses, or, condemns, cremation, leaving, the, choice, to, individuals, and, families, resources, within, the, official, ritual, refer, to, the, possible, use, of, an, urn, and, the, interment, of, ashes, some, branches, of, christianity, entirely, oppose, cremation, including, non, mainstream, protestant, groups, and, the, orthodox, churches, most, notably, the, eastern, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, historically, forbid, cremation, but, not, dogmatically, exceptions, are, made, for, circumstances, where, it, cannot, be, avoided, when, civil, authority, demands, it, in, aftermath, of, war, or, during, epidemics, or, if, it, may, be, sought, for, good, cause, such, as, the, discovery, of, body, already, in, the, state, of, decomposition, but, when, a, cremation, is, specifically, and, willfully, chosen, for, no, good, cause, by, the, one, who, is, deceased, he, or, she, is, not, permitted, a, funeral, in, the, church, and, may, also, be, permanently, excluded, from, burial, in, a, christian, cemetery, and, liturgical, prayers, for, the, departed, in, orthodoxy, cremation, is, perceived, as, a, rejection, of, the, temple, of, god, and, of, the, dogma, of, the, general, resurrection, most, independent, bible, churches, free, churches, holiness, churches, and, those, of, anabaptist, faiths, will, not, practice, cremation, as, one, example, the, church, of, god, restoration, forbids, the, practice, of, cremation, believing, as, the, early, church, did, that, it, continues, to, be, a, pagan, practice, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, has, in, past, decades, discouraged, cremation, without, expressly, forbidding, it, in, the, 1950s, for, example, apostle, bruce, r, mcconkie, wrote, that, only, under, the, most, extraordinary, and, unusual, circumstances, would, cremation, be, consistent, with, lds, teachings, more, recent, lds, publications, have, provided, instructions, for, how, to, dress, the, deceased, when, they, have, received, their, temple, endowments, and, thus, wear, temple, garments, prior, to, cremation, for, those, wishing, to, do, so, or, in, countries, where, the, law, requires, cremation, except, where, required, by, law, the, family, of, the, deceased, may, decide, whether, the, body, should, be, cremated, though, the, church, does, not, normally, encourage, cremation, indian, religions, such, as, hinduism, buddhism, jainism, and, sikhism, practice, cremation, the, founder, of, buddhism, the, buddha, was, cremated, a, dead, adult, hindu, is, mourned, with, a, cremation, while, a, dead, child, is, typically, buried, the, rite, of, passage, is, performed, in, harmony, with, the, hindu, religious, view, that, the, microcosm, of, all, living, beings, is, a, reflection, of, a, macrocosm, of, the, universe, the, soul, atman, brahman, is, the, essence, and, immortal, that, is, released, at, the, antyesti, ritual, but, both, the, body, and, the, universe, are, vehicles, and, transitory, in, various, schools, of, hinduism, they, consist, of, five, elements, air, water, fire, earth, and, space, the, last, rite, of, passage, returns, the, body, to, the, five, elements, and, origins, the, roots, of, this, belief, are, found, in, the, vedas, for, example, in, the, hymns, of, rigveda, in, section, 10, 16, as, follows, burn, him, not, up, nor, quite, consume, him, agni, let, not, his, body, or, his, skin, be, scattered, o, all, possessing, fire, when, thou, hast, matured, him, then, send, him, on, his, way, unto, the, fathers, when, thou, hast, made, him, ready, all, possessing, fire, then, do, thou, give, him, over, to, the, fathers, when, he, attains, unto, the, life, that, waits, him, he, shall, become, subject, to, the, will, of, gods, the, sun, receive, thine, eye, the, wind, thy, prana, life, principle, breathe, go, as, thy, merit, is, to, earth, or, heaven, go, if, it, be, thy, lot, unto, the, waters, go, make, thine, home, in, plants, with, all, thy, members, the, final, rite, in, the, case, of, untimely, death, of, a, child, is, usually, not, cremation, but, a, burial, this, is, rooted, in, rigveda, s, section, 10, 18, where, the, hymns, mourn, the, death, of, the, child, praying, to, deity, mrityu, to, neither, harm, our, girls, nor, our, boys, and, pleads, the, earth, to, cover, protect, the, deceased, child, as, a, soft, wool, ashes, of, the, cremated, bodies, are, usually, spread, in, rivers, which, are, considered, holy, in, the, hindu, practice, the, ganges, is, considered, to, be, the, holiest, river, and, varanasi, situated, on, the, banks, of, the, river, is, regarded, as, the, most, sacred, site, for, cremation, balinese, hindu, dead, are, generally, buried, inside, the, container, for, a, period, of, time, which, may, exceed, one, month, or, more, so, that, the, cremation, ceremony, ngaben, can, occur, on, an,
