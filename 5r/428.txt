el, dorado, spanish, english, l, d, r, d, o, spanish, for, the, golden, is, commonly, associated, with, the, legend, of, a, gold, city, kingdom, or, empire, purportedly, located, somewhere, in, the, americas, originally, el, hombre, dorado, the, golden, man, or, el, rey, dorado, the, golden, king, was, the, term, used, by, the, spanish, in, the, 16th, century, to, describe, a, mythical, tribal, chief, zipa, or, king, of, the, muisca, people, an, indigenous, people, of, the, altiplano, cundiboyacense, of, colombia, who, as, an, initiation, rite, covered, himself, with, gold, dust, and, submerged, himself, in, lake, guatavita, a, second, location, for, el, dorado, was, inferred, from, rumors, which, inspired, several, unsuccessful, expeditions, in, the, late, 16th, century, in, search, of, a, city, called, manoa, on, the, shores, of, lake, parime, or, parima, two, of, the, most, famous, of, these, expeditions, were, led, by, sir, walter, raleigh, in, pursuit, of, the, legend, spanish, conquistadores, and, numerous, others, searched, what, is, today, colombia, venezuela, and, parts, of, guyana, and, northern, brazil, for, the, city, and, its, fabulous, king, in, the, course, of, these, explorations, much, of, northern, south, america, including, the, amazon, river, was, mapped, by, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, most, people, dismissed, the, existence, of, the, city, as, a, myth, the, legend, of, the, seven, cities, of, gold, seven, cities, of, cibola, led, to, francisco, v, zquez, de, coronado, s, expedition, of, 1540, across, the, new, mexico, territory, this, became, mixed, with, the, stories, of, el, dorado, which, was, sometimes, said, to, be, one, of, the, seven, cities, several, literary, works, have, used, the, name, in, their, titles, sometimes, as, el, dorado, and, other, times, as, el, dorado, the, muisca, people, occupied, the, highlands, of, cundinamarca, and, boyac, departments, of, colombia, in, two, migrations, from, outlying, lowland, areas, one, starting, c, 1270, bc, and, a, second, between, 800, bc, and, 500, bc, at, those, times, other, more, ancient, civilizations, also, flourished, in, the, highlands, the, muisca, confederation, had, a, comparable, level, of, organizational, development, as, the, aztec, maya, and, inca, civilizations, in, the, mythology, of, the, muisca, mnya, the, gold, or, golden, color, represents, the, energy, contained, in, the, trinity, of, chiminigagua, which, constitutes, the, creative, power, of, everything, that, exists, chiminigagua, is, related, to, bachu, cuza, chibchacum, bochica, and, nencatacoa, the, original, narrative, can, be, found, in, the, rambling, chronicle, el, carnero, of, juan, rodriguez, freyle, according, to, freyle, the, zipa, of, the, muisca, in, a, ritual, at, lake, guatavita, near, present, day, bogot, was, said, to, be, covered, with, gold, dust, which, he, then, washed, off, in, the, lake, while, his, attendants, threw, objects, made, of, gold, emeralds, and, precious, stones, into, the, lake, such, as, tunjos, in, 1638, freyle, wrote, this, account, of, the, ceremony, addressed, to, the, cacique, or, governor, of, guatavita, the, ceremony, took, place, on, the, appointment, of, a, new, ruler, before, taking, office, he, spent, some, time, secluded, in, a, cave, without, women, forbidden, to, eat, salt, or, to, go, out, during, daylight, the, first, journey, he, had, to, make, was, to, go, to, the, great, lagoon, of, guatavita, to, make, offerings, and, sacrifices, to, the, demon, which, they, worshipped, as, their, god, and, lord, during, the, ceremony, which, took, place, at, the, lagoon, they, made, a, raft, of, rushes, embellishing, and, decorating, it, with, the, most, attractive, things, they, had, they, put, on, it, four, lighted, braziers, in, which, they, burned, much, moque, which, is, the, incense, of, these, natives, and, also, resin, and, many, other, perfumes, the, lagoon, was, large, and, deep, so, that, a, ship, with, high, sides, could, sail, on, it, all, loaded, with, an, infinity, of, men, and, women, dressed, in, fine, plumes, golden, plaques, and, crowns, as, soon, as, those, on, the, raft, began, to, burn, incense, they, also, lit, braziers, on, the, shore, so, that, the, smoke, hid, the, light, of, day, at, this, time, they, stripped, the, heir, to, his, skin, and, anointed, him, with, a, sticky, earth, on, which, they, placed, gold, dust, so, that, he, was, completely, covered, with, this, metal, they, placed, him, on, the, raft, and, at, his, feet, they, placed, a, great, heap, of, gold, and, emeralds, for, him, to, offer, to, his, god, in, the, raft, with, him, went, four, principal, subject, chiefs, decked, in, plumes, crowns, bracelets, pendants, and, ear, rings, all, of, gold, they, too, were, naked, and, each, one, carried, his, offering, when, the, raft, reached, the, centre, of, the, lagoon, they, raised, a, banner, as, a, signal, for, silence, the, gilded, indian, then, out, all, the, pile, of, gold, into, the, middle, of, the, lake, and, the, chiefs, who, had, accompanied, him, did, the, same, on, their, own, accounts, after, this, they, lowered, the, flag, which, had, remained, up, during, the, whole, time, of, offering, and, as, the, raft, moved, towards, the, shore, the, shouting, began, again, with, pipes, flutes, and, large, teams, of, singers, and, dancers, with, this, ceremony, the, new, ruler, was, received, and, was, recognized, as, lord, and, king, this, is, the, ceremony, that, became, the, famous, el, dorado, which, has, taken, so, many, lives, and, fortunes, there, is, also, an, account, titled, the, quest, of, el, dorado, by, poet, priest, and, historian, of, the, conquest, juan, de, castellanos, who, had, served, under, jim, nez, de, quesada, in, his, campaign, against, the, muisca, written, in, the, mid, 16th, century, but, not, published, until, 1850, an, alien, indian, hailing, from, afar, who, in, the, town, of, quito, did, abide, and, neighbor, claimed, to, be, of, bogata, there, having, come, i, know, not, by, what, way, did, with, him, speak, and, solemnly, announce, a, country, rich, in, emeralds, and, gold, also, among, us, the, things, which, them, engaged, a, certain, king, he, told, of, who, disrobed, upon, a, lake, was, wont, aboard, a, raft, to, make, oblations, as, himself, had, seen, his, regal, form, overspread, with, fragrant, oil, on, which, was, laid, a, coat, of, powdered, gold, from, sole, of, foot, unto, his, highest, brow, resplendent, as, the, beaming, of, the, sun, arrivals, without, end, he, further, said, were, there, to, make, rich, votive, offerings, of, golden, trinkets, and, of, emeralds, rare, and, divers, other, of, their, ornaments, and, worthy, credence, these, things, he, affirmed, the, soldiers, light, of, heart, and, well, content, then, dubbed, him, el, dorado, and, the, name, by, countless, ways, was, spread, throughout, the, world, in, his, historia, general, y, natural, de, las, indias, 1535, expanded, in, 1851, from, his, previously, unpublished, papers, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, oviedo, y, vald, s, stated, he, went, about, all, covered, with, powdered, gold, as, casually, as, if, it, were, powdered, salt, for, it, seemed, to, him, that, to, wear, any, other, finery, was, less, beautiful, and, that, to, put, on, ornaments, or, arms, made, of, gold, worked, by, hammering, stamping, or, by, other, means, was, a, vulgar, and, common, thing, in, the, muisca, territories, there, were, a, number, of, natural, locations, considered, sacred, including, lakes, rivers, forests, and, large, rocks, people, gathered, here, to, perform, rituals, and, sacrifices, mostly, with, gold, and, emeralds, important, lakes, were, lake, guatavita, lake, iguaque, lake, f, quene, lake, tota, the, siecha, lakes, lake, teusac, and, lake, ubaque, the, concept, of, el, dorado, underwent, several, transformations, and, eventually, accounts, of, the, previous, myth, a, legendary, story, in, which, precious, stones, were, found, in, fabulous, abundance, along, with, gold, coins, were, also, combined, with, those, of, a, legendary, lost, city, the, resulting, el, dorado, myth, enticed, european, explorers, for, two, centuries, among, the, earliest, stories, was, the, one, told, on, his, deathbed, by, juan, martinez, a, captain, of, munitions, for, spanish, adventurer, diego, de, ordaz, who, claimed, to, have, visited, the, city, of, manoa, martinez, had, allowed, a, store, of, powder, to, catch, fire, and, was, condemned, to, death, but, his, friends, let, him, escape, downriver, in, a, canoe, martinez, then, met, with, some, local, people, who, took, him, to, the, city, the, canoa, was, carried, down, the, stream, and, certain, of, the, guianians, met, it, the, same, evening, and, having, not, at, any, time, seen, any, christian, nor, any, man, of, that, colour, they, carried, martinez, into, the, land, to, be, wondered, at, and, so, from, town, to, town, until, he, came, to, the, great, city, of, manoa, the, seat, and, residence, of, inga, the, emperor, the, emperor, after, he, had, beheld, him, knew, him, to, be, a, christian, and, caused, him, to, be, lodged, in, his, palace, and, well, entertained, he, was, brought, thither, all, the, way, blindfold, led, by, the, indians, until, he, came, to, the, entrance, of, manoa, itself, and, was, fourteen, or, fifteen, days, in, the, passage, he, avowed, at, his, death, that, he, entered, the, city, at, noon, and, then, they, uncovered, his, face, and, that, he, traveled, all, that, day, till, night, through, the, city, and, the, next, day, from, sun, rising, to, sun, setting, ere, he, came, to, the, palace, of, inga, after, that, martinez, had, lived, seven, months, in, manoa, and, began, to, understand, the, language, of, the, country, inga, asked, him, whether, he, desired, to, return, into, his, own, country, or, would, willingly, abide, with, him, but, martinez, not, desirous, to, stay, obtained, the, favour, of, inga, to, depart, the, fable, of, juan, martinez, was, founded, on, the, adventures, of, juan, martin, de, albujar, well, known, to, the, spanish, historians, of, the, conquest, and, who, in, the, expedition, of, pedro, de, silva, 1570, fell, into, the, hands, of, the, caribs, of, the, lower, orinoco, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, europeans, still, fascinated, by, the, new, world, believed, that, a, hidden, city, of, immense, wealth, existed, numerous, expeditions, were, mounted, to, search, for, this, treasure, all, of, which, ended, in, failure, the, illustration, of, el, dorado, s, location, on, maps, only, made, matters, worse, as, it, made, some, people, think, that, the, city, of, el, dorado, s, existence, had, been, confirmed, the, mythical, city, of, el, dorado, on, lake, parime, was, marked, on, numerous, maps, until, its, existence, was, disproved, by, alexander, von, humboldt, during, his, latin, america, expedition, 1799, 1804, meanwhile, the, name, of, el, dorado, came, to, be, used, metaphorically, of, any, place, where, wealth, could, be, rapidly, acquired, it, was, given, to, el, dorado, county, california, and, to, towns, and, cities, in, various, states, it, has, also, been, anglicized, to, the, single, word, eldorado, and, is, sometimes, used, in, product, titles, to, suggest, great, wealth, and, fortune, such, as, the, cadillac, eldorado, line, of, luxury, automobiles, el, dorado, is, also, sometimes, used, as, a, metaphor, to, represent, an, ultimate, prize, or, holy, grail, that, one, might, spend, one, s, life, seeking, it, could, represent, true, love, heaven, happiness, or, success, it, is, used, sometimes, as, a, figure, of, speech, to, represent, something, much, sought, after, that, may, not, even, exist, or, at, least, may, not, ever, be, found, such, use, is, evident, in, edgar, allan, poe, s, poem, el, dorado, in, this, context, el, dorado, bears, similarity, to, other, myths, such, as, the, fountain, of, youth, and, shangri, la, the, other, side, of, the, ideal, quest, metaphor, may, be, represented, by, helldorado, a, satirical, nickname, given, to, tombstone, arizona, united, states, in, the, 1880s, by, a, disgruntled, miner, who, complained, that, many, of, his, profession, had, traveled, far, to, find, el, dorado, only, to, wind, up, washing, dishes, in, restaurants, the, south, african, city, johannesburg, is, commonly, interpreted, as, a, modern, day, el, dorado, due, to, the, extremely, large, gold, deposit, found, along, the, witwatersrand, on, which, it, is, situated, spanish, conquistadores, had, noticed, the, native, people, s, fine, artifacts, of, gold, and, silver, long, before, any, legend, of, golden, men, or, lost, cities, had, appeared, the, prevalence, of, such, valuable, artifacts, and, the, natives, apparent, ignorance, of, their, value, inspired, speculation, as, to, a, plentiful, source, for, them, prior, to, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, muisca, and, discovery, of, lake, guatavita, a, handful, of, expeditions, had, set, out, to, explore, the, lowlands, to, the, east, of, the, andes, in, search, of, gold, cinnamon, precious, stones, and, anything, else, of, value, during, the, klein, venedig, period, in, venezuela, 1528, 1546, agents, of, the, german, welser, banking, family, which, had, received, a, concession, from, charles, i, of, spain, launched, repeated, expeditions, into, the, interior, of, the, country, in, search, of, gold, starting, with, ambrosius, ehinger, s, first, expedition, in, july, 1529, spanish, explorer, diego, de, ordaz, then, governor, of, the, eastern, part, of, venezuela, known, as, paria, named, after, paria, peninsula, was, the, first, european, to, explore, the, orinoco, river, in, 1531, 32, in, search, of, gold, a, veteran, of, hern, n, cort, s, s, campaign, in, mexico, ordaz, followed, the, orinoco, beyond, the, mouth, of, the, meta, river, but, was, blocked, by, the, rapids, at, atures, after, his, return, he, died, possibly, poisoned, on, a, voyage, back, to, spain, after, the, death, of, ordaz, while, returning, from, his, expedition, the, crown, appointed, a, new, governor, of, paria, jer, nimo, de, ortal, who, diligently, explored, the, interior, along, the, meta, river, between, 1532, and, 1537, in, 1535, he, ordered, captain, alonso, de, herrera, to, move, inland, by, the, waters, of, the, uyapari, river, today, the, town, of, barrancas, del, orinoco, herrera, who, had, accompanied, ordaz, three, years, before, explored, the, meta, river, but, was, killed, by, the, indigenous, achagua, near, its, banks, while, waiting, out, the, winter, rains, in, casanare, even, before, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, and, inca, empires, and, the, muisca, confederation, the, spanish, collected, vague, hearsay, about, these, polities, and, their, riches, after, the, inca, empire, in, peru, was, conquered, by, francisco, pizarro, and, its, riches, proved, real, new, rumours, of, riches, reached, the, spanish, the, earliest, reference, to, an, el, dorado, like, kingdom, occurred, in, 1531, during, ordaz, s, expedition, when, he, was, told, of, a, kingdom, called, meta, that, was, said, to, exist, beyond, a, mountain, on, the, left, bank, of, the, orinoco, river, meta, was, supposedly, abundant, in, gold, and, ruled, by, a, chief, that, only, had, one, intact, eye, between, 1531, and, 1538, the, german, conquistadors, nikolaus, federmann, and, georg, von, speyer, searched, the, venezuelan, lowlands, colombian, plateaus, orinoco, basin, and, llanos, orientales, for, el, dorado, subsequently, philipp, von, hutten, accompanied, von, speyer, on, a, journey, 1536, 38, in, which, they, reached, the, headwaters, of, the, rio, japura, near, the, equator, in, 1541, hutten, led, an, exploring, party, of, about, 150, men, mostly, horsemen, from, coro, on, the, coast, of, venezuela, in, search, of, the, golden, city, after, several, years, of, wandering, harassed, by, the, natives, and, weakened, by, hunger, and, fever, he, crossed, the, rio, bermejo, and, went, on, with, a, small, group, of, around, 40, men, on, horseback, into, los, llanos, where, they, engaged, in, battle, with, a, large, number, of, omaguas, and, hutten, was, severely, wounded, he, led, those, of, his, followers, who, survived, back, to, coro, in, 1546, on, hutten, s, return, he, and, a, traveling, companion, bartholomeus, vi, welser, were, executed, in, el, tocuyo, by, the, spanish, authorities, in, 1535, sebastian, de, benalcazar, a, lieutenant, of, francisco, pizarro, interrogated, an, indian, that, had, been, captured, at, quito, luis, daza, recorded, that, the, indian, was, a, warrior, while, antonio, de, herrera, y, tordesillas, wrote, that, the, indian, was, an, ambassador, who, had, come, to, request, military, assistance, from, the, inca, unaware, that, they, had, already, been, conquered, the, indian, told, benalcazar, that, he, was, from, a, kingdom, of, riches, known, as, cundinamarca, far, to, the, north, where, a, zipa, or, chief, covered, himself, in, gold, dust, during, ceremonies, benalcazar, set, out, to, find, the, chief, reportedly, saying, lets, go, find, that, golden, indian, spanish, v, mos, a, buscar, a, este, indio, dorado, eventually, the, chief, became, known, to, the, spaniards, as, el, dorado, benalcazar, failed, however, to, find, el, dorado, and, eventually, joined, up, with, federmann, and, gonzalo, jimenez, de, quesada, and, returned, to, spain, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, land, of, wealth, spoken, of, by, the, indian, was, arma, a, kingdom, whose, inhabitants, wore, gold, ornaments, which, was, eventually, conquered, by, pedro, cieza, de, leon, in, 1536, gonzalo, d, az, de, pineda, led, an, expedition, to, the, lowlands, to, the, east, of, quito, and, found, cinnamon, trees, but, no, rich, empire, in, 1536, stories, of, el, dorado, drew, the, spanish, conquistador, gonzalo, jimenez, de, quesada, and, his, army, of, 800, men, away, from, their, mission, to, find, an, overland, route, to, peru, and, up, into, the, andean, homeland, of, the, muisca, for, the, first, time, the, southern, muisca, settlements, and, their, treasures, quickly, fell, to, the, conquistadors, in, 1537, and, 1538, on, the, bogot, savanna, quesada, received, reports, from, captured, natives, about, a, kingdom, called, metza, whose, inhabitants, built, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, sun, and, keep, in, it, an, infinite, quantity, of, gold, and, jewels, and, live, in, stone, houses, go, about, dressed, and, booted, and, fight, with, lances, and, maces, quesada, believed, this, might, have, been, el, dorado, and, decided, to, postpone, his, return, to, santa, marta, and, continue, his, expedition, for, another, year, after, his, brother, gonzalo, had, left, for, spain, in, may, 1539, spanish, conquistador, hern, n, p, rez, de, quesada, set, out, a, new, expedition, in, september, 1540, leaving, with, 270, spanish, soldiers, and, countless, indigenous, porters, to, explore, the, llanos, orientales, one, of, his, main, captains, on, this, journey, was, baltasar, maldonado, their, expedition, was, unsuccessful, and, after, reaching, quito, the, troops, returned, to, santafe, de, bogot, in, december, of, 1540, gonzalo, pizarro, the, younger, half, brother, of, francisco, pizarro, the, spanish, conquistador, who, toppled, the, incan, empire, in, peru, as, vice, governor, of, the, province, of, quito, current, ecuador, prepared, in, cusco, an, expedition, of, 170, spaniards, and, 3, 000, natives, and, departed, to, quito, to, explore, lands, far, to, the, east, where, many, natives, talked, of, the, existence, of, a, valley, rich, in, both, cinnamon, and, gold, when, he, arrived, in, quito, he, banded, together, 220, soldiers, and, about, 4, 000, natives, and, departed, in, february, 1541, he, led, them, eastward, down, the, rio, coca, and, rio, napo, francisco, de, orellana, a, relative, of, pizarro, accompanied, him, on, the, expedition, as, his, second, in, command, gonzalo, quit, after, many, of, the, soldiers, and, natives, had, died, from, hunger, disease, and, periodic, attacks, by, hostile, natives, he, ordered, orellana, to, continue, downstream, where, he, eventually, made, it, to, the, atlantic, ocean, the, expedition, found, neither, cinnamon, nor, gold, but, orellana, is, credited, with, discovering, the, amazon, river, so, named, because, of, a, tribe, of, female, warriors, that, attacked, orellana, s, men, while, on, their, voyage, in, 1560, basque, conquistadors, pedro, de, urs, a, and, lope, de, aguirre, journeyed, down, the, mara, n, and, amazon, rivers, in, search, of, el, dorado, with, 300, spaniards, and, hundreds, of, natives, the, actual, goal, of, urs, a, was, to, send, idle, veterans, from, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, inca, empire, away, to, keep, them, from, trouble, making, using, the, el, dorado, myth, as, a, lure, a, year, later, aguirre, participated, in, the, overthrow, and, killing, of, urs, a, and, his, successor, fernando, de, guzm, n, whom, he, ultimately, succeeded, he, and, his, men, reached, the, atlantic, probably, by, the, orinoco, river, destroying, native, villages, of, margarita, island, and, actual, venezuela, in, 1561, aguirre, s, expedition, ended, with, his, death, in, barquisimeto, and, in, the, years, since, then, he, has, been, treated, by, historians, as, a, symbol, of, cruelty, and, treachery, in, the, early, history, of, colonial, spanish, america, while, the, existence, of, a, sacred, lake, in, the, eastern, ranges, of, the, andes, associated, with, indian, rituals, involving, gold, was, known, to, the, spaniards, possibly, as, early, as, 1531, its, location, was, only, discovered, in, 1537, by, conquistador, gonzalo, jim, nez, de, quesada, while, on, an, expedition, to, the, highlands, of, the, eastern, ranges, of, the, andes, in, search, of, gold, conquistadores, l, zaro, fonte, and, hern, n, perez, de, quesada, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, drain, the, lake, in, 1545, using, a, bucket, chain, of, labourers, after, three, months, the, water, level, had, been, reduced, by, three, metres, 9, 8, feet, and, only, a, small, amount, of, gold, was, recovered, with, a, value, of, 3, 000, 4, 000, pesos, approx, us, 100, 000, today, a, peso, or, piece, of, eight, of, the, 15th, century, weighs, 0, 88, oz, of, 93, pure, silver, a, later, more, industrious, attempt, was, made, in, 1580, by, bogot, business, entrepreneur, antonio, de, sep, lveda, a, notch, was, cut, deep, into, the, rim, of, the, lake, which, managed, to, reduce, the, water, level, by, 20, metres, 65, 6, feet, before, collapsing, and, killing, many, of, the, labourers, a, share, of, the, findings, consisting, of, various, golden, ornaments, jewellery, and, armour, was, sent, to, king, philip, ii, of, spain, sep, lveda, s, discovery, came, to, approximately, 12, 000, pesos, he, died, a, poor, man, and, is, buried, at, the, church, in, the, small, town, of, guatavita, in, 1801, alexander, von, humboldt, made, a, visit, to, guatavita, and, on, his, return, to, paris, calculated, from, the, findings, of, sep, lveda, s, efforts, that, guatavita, could, offer, up, as, much, as, 300, million, worth, of, gold, in, 1898, the, company, for, the, exploitation, of, the, lagoon, of, guatavita, was, formed, and, taken, over, by, contractors, ltd, of, london, in, a, deal, brokered, by, british, expatriate, hartley, knowles, the, lake, was, drained, by, a, tunnel, that, emerged, in, the,

expedition, ascending, the, orinoco, to, reach, the, caron, river, with, his, own, expeditionaries, and, another, 470, men, under, command, of, domingo, de, vera, in, march, 1591, while, he, was, waiting, for, supplies, on, margarita, island, his, entire, force, was, taken, captive, by, walter, raleigh, who, proceeded, up, the, orinoco, in, search, of, el, dorado, with, berrio, as, a, guide, berrio, took, them, to, the, territories, he, had, previously, explored, by, himself, years, before, after, several, months, raleigh, s, expedition, returned, to, trinidad, and, he, released, berrio, at, the, end, of, june, 1595, on, the, coast, of, cuman, in, exchange, for, some, english, prisoners, his, son, fernando, de, berr, o, y, oru, a, 1577, 1622, also, made, numerous, expeditions, in, search, of, el, dorado, walter, raleigh, s, 1595, journey, with, antonio, de, berrio, had, aimed, to, reach, lake, parime, in, the, highlands, of, guyana, the, supposed, location, of, el, dorado, at, the, time, he, was, encouraged, by, the, account, of, juan, martinez, believed, to, be, juan, martin, de, albujar, who, had, taken, part, in, pedro, de, silva, s, expedition, of, the, area, in, 1570, only, to, fall, into, the, hands, of, the, caribs, of, the, lower, orinoco, martinez, claimed, that, he, was, taken, to, the, golden, city, in, blindfold, was, entertained, by, the, natives, and, then, left, the, city, and, couldn, t, remember, how, to, return, raleigh, had, set, many, goals, for, his, expedition, and, believed, he, had, a, genuine, chance, at, finding, the, so, called, city, of, gold, first, he, wanted, to, find, the, mythical, city, of, el, dorado, which, he, suspected, to, be, an, actual, indian, city, named, man, a, second, he, hoped, to, establish, an, english, presence, in, the, southern, hemisphere, that, could, compete, with, that, of, the, spanish, his, third, goal, was, to, create, an, english, settlement, in, the, land, called, guyana, and, to, try, to, reduce, commerce, between, the, natives, and, spaniards, in, 1596, raleigh, sent, his, lieutenant, lawrence, kemys, back, to, guyana, in, the, area, of, the, orinoco, river, to, gather, more, information, about, the, lake, and, the, golden, city, during, his, exploration, of, the, coast, between, the, amazon, and, the, orinoco, kemys, mapped, the, location, of, amerindian, tribes, and, prepared, geographical, geological, and, botanical, reports, of, the, country, kemys, described, the, coast, of, guiana, in, detail, in, his, relation, of, the, second, voyage, to, guiana, 1596, and, wrote, that, indigenous, people, of, guiana, traveled, inland, by, canoe, and, land, passages, towards, a, large, body, of, water, on, the, shores, of, which, he, supposed, was, located, manoa, golden, city, of, el, dorado, though, raleigh, never, found, el, dorado, he, was, convinced, that, there, was, some, fantastic, city, whose, riches, could, be, discovered, finding, gold, on, the, riverbanks, and, in, villages, only, strengthened, his, resolve, in, 1617, he, returned, to, the, new, world, on, a, second, expedition, this, time, with, kemys, and, his, son, watt, raleigh, to, continue, his, quest, for, el, dorado, however, raleigh, by, now, an, old, man, stayed, behind, in, a, camp, on, the, island, of, trinidad, watt, raleigh, was, killed, in, a, battle, with, spaniards, and, kemys, subsequently, committed, suicide, upon, raleigh, s, return, to, england, king, james, ordered, him, to, be, beheaded, for, disobeying, orders, to, avoid, conflict, with, the, spanish, he,

undertook, several, journeys, to, the, lands, of, the, manoas, indigenous, peoples, living, in, western, guyana, and, what, is, now, roraima, in, northeastern, brazil, although, they, found, no, evidence, of, el, dorado, their, published, accounts, were, intended, to, inspire, further, exploration, in, november, 1739, nicholas, horstman, a, german, surgeon, commissioned, by, the, dutch, governor, of, guiana, traveled, up, the, essequibo, river, accompanied, by, two, dutch, soldiers, and, four, indian, guides, in, april, 1741, one, of, the, indian, guides, returned, reporting, that,

between, 1799, and, 1804, alexander, von, humboldt, conducted, an, extensive, and, scientific, survey, of, the, guyana, river, basins, and, lakes, concluding, that, a, seasonally, flooded, confluence, of, rivers, may, be, what, inspired, the, notion, of, a, mythical, lake, parime, and, of, the, supposed, golden, city, on, the, shore, nothing, was, found, further, exploration, by, charles, waterton, 1812, and, robert, schomburgk, 1840, confirmed, humboldt, s, findings, it, appears, today, that, the, muisca, obtained, their, gold, in, trade, and, while, they, possessed, large, quantities, of, it,
