theology, is, the, study, of, religious, belief, from, a, religious, perspective, with, a, focus, on, the, nature, of, divinity, it, is, taught, as, an, academic, discipline, typically, in, universities, and, seminaries, it, occupies, itself, with, the, unique, content, of, analyzing, the, supernatural, but, also, deals, with, religious, epistemology, asks, and, seeks, to, answer, the, question, of, revelation, revelation, pertains, to, the, acceptance, of, god, gods, or, deities, as, not, only, transcendent, or, above, the, natural, world, but, also, willing, and, able, to, interact, with, the, natural, world, and, to, reveal, themselves, to, humankind, theologians, use, various, forms, of, analysis, and, argument, experiential, philosophical, ethnographic, historical, and, others, to, help, understand, explain, test, critique, defend, or, promote, any, myriad, of, religious, topics, as, in, philosophy, of, ethics, and, case, law, arguments, often, assume, the, existence, of, previously, resolved, questions, and, develop, by, making, analogies, from, them, to, draw, new, inferences, in, new, situations, the, study, of, theology, may, help, a, theologian, more, deeply, understand, their, own, religious, tradition, another, religious, tradition, or, it, may, enable, them, to, explore, the, nature, of, divinity, without, reference, to, any, specific, tradition, theology, may, be, used, to, propagate, reform, or, justify, a, religious, tradition, or, it, may, be, used, to, compare, challenge, e, g, biblical, criticism, or, oppose, e, g, irreligion, a, religious, tradition, or, worldview, theology, might, also, help, a, theologian, address, some, present, situation, or, need, through, a, religious, tradition, or, to, explore, possible, ways, of, interpreting, the, world, the, term, theology, derives, from, the, greek, theologia, a, combination, of, theos, god, and, logia, utterances, sayings, oracles, the, latter, word, relating, to, greek, logos, word, discourse, account, reasoning, the, term, would, pass, on, to, latin, as, theologia, then, french, as, th, ologie, eventually, becoming, the, english, theology, through, several, variants, e, g, theologie, teologye, the, english, theology, had, evolved, into, its, current, form, by, 1362, the, sense, that, the, word, has, in, english, depends, in, large, part, on, the, sense, that, the, latin, and, greek, equivalents, had, acquired, in, patristic, and, medieval, christian, usage, although, the, english, term, has, now, spread, beyond, christian, contexts, greek, theologia, was, used, with, the, meaning, discourse, on, god, around, 380, bc, by, plato, in, the, republic, aristotle, divided, theoretical, philosophy, into, mathematike, physike, and, theologike, with, the, latter, corresponding, roughly, to, metaphysics, which, for, aristotle, included, discourse, on, the, nature, of, the, divine, drawing, on, greek, stoic, sources, the, latin, writer, varro, distinguished, three, forms, of, such, discourse, some, latin, christian, authors, such, as, tertullian, and, augustine, followed, varro, s, threefold, usage, however, augustine, also, defined, theologia, as, reasoning, or, discussion, concerning, the, deity, the, latin, author, boethius, writing, in, the, early, 6th, century, used, theologia, to, denote, a, subdivision, of, philosophy, as, a, subject, of, academic, study, dealing, with, the, motionless, incorporeal, reality, as, opposed, to, physica, which, deals, with, corporeal, moving, realities, boethius, definition, influenced, medieval, latin, usage, in, patristic, greek, christian, sources, theologia, could, refer, narrowly, to, devout, and, or, inspired, knowledge, of, and, teaching, about, the, essential, nature, of, god, in, scholastic, latin, sources, the, term, came, to, denote, the, rational, study, of, the, doctrines, of, the, christian, religion, or, more, precisely, the, academic, discipline, that, investigated, the, coherence, and, implications, of, the, language, and, claims, of, the, bible, and, of, the, theological, tradition, the, latter, often, as, represented, in, peter, lombard, s, sentences, a, book, of, extracts, from, the, church, fathers, in, the, renaissance, especially, with, florentine, platonist, apologists, of, dante, s, poetics, the, distinction, between, poetic, theology, theologia, poetica, and, revealed, or, biblical, theology, serves, as, stepping, stone, for, a, revival, of, philosophy, as, independent, of, theological, authority, it, is, in, the, last, sense, theology, as, an, academic, discipline, involving, rational, study, of, christian, teaching, that, the, term, passed, into, english, in, the, 14th, century, although, it, could, also, be, used, in, the, narrower, sense, found, in, boethius, and, the, greek, patristic, authors, to, mean, rational, study, of, the, essential, nature, of, god, a, discourse, now, sometimes, called, theology, proper, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, the, term, theology, began, to, be, used, to, refer, to, the, study, of, religious, ideas, and, teachings, that, are, not, specifically, christian, or, correlated, with, christianity, e, g, in, the, term, natural, theology, which, denoted, theology, based, on, reasoning, from, natural, facts, independent, of, specifically, christian, revelation, or, that, are, specific, to, another, religion, such, as, below, theology, can, also, be, used, in, a, derived, sense, to, mean, a, system, of, theoretical, principles, an, impractical, or, rigid, ideology, the, term, theology, has, been, deemed, by, some, as, only, appropriate, to, the, study, of, religions, that, worship, a, supposed, deity, a, theos, i, e, more, widely, than, monotheism, and, presuppose, a, belief, in, the, ability, to, speak, and, reason, about, this, deity, in, logia, they, suggest, the, term, is, less, appropriate, in, religious, contexts, that, are, organized, differently, i, e, religions, without, a, single, deity, or, that, deny, that, such, subjects, can, be, studied, logically, hierology, has, been, proposed, by, such, people, as, eug, ne, goblet, d, alviella, 1908, as, an, alternative, more, generic, term, as, defined, by, thomas, aquinas, theology, is, constituted, by, a, triple, aspect, what, is, taught, by, god, teaches, of, god, and, leads, to, god, latin, theologia, a, deo, docetur, deum, docet, et, ad, deum, ducit, this, indicates, the, three, distinct, areas, of, god, as, theophanic, revelation, the, systematic, study, of, the, nature, of, divine, and, more, generally, of, religious, belief, and, the, spiritual, path, christian, theology, as, the, study, of, christian, belief, and, practice, concentrates, primarily, upon, the, texts, of, the, old, testament, and, the, new, testament, as, well, as, on, christian, tradition, christian, theologians, use, biblical, exegesis, rational, analysis, and, argument, theology, might, be, undertaken, to, help, the, theologian, better, understand, christian, tenets, to, make, comparisons, between, christianity, and, other, traditions, to, defend, christianity, against, objections, and, criticism, to, facilitate, reforms, in, the, christian, church, to, assist, in, the, propagation, of, christianity, to, draw, on, the, resources, of, the, christian, tradition, to, address, some, present, situation, or, need, or, for, a, variety, of, other, reasons, islamic, theological, discussion, that, parallels, christian, theological, discussion, is, called, kalam, the, islamic, analogue, of, christian, theological, discussion, would, more, properly, be, the, investigation, and, elaboration, of, sharia, or, fiqh, kalam, does, not, hold, the, leading, place, in, muslim, thought, that, theology, does, in, christianity, to, find, an, equivalent, for, theology, in, the, christian, sense, it, is, necessary, to, have, recourse, to, several, disciplines, and, to, the, usul, al, fiqh, as, much, as, to, kalam, some, universities, in, germany, established, departments, of, islamic, theology, i, e, in, jewish, theology, the, historical, absence, of, political, authority, has, meant, that, most, theological, reflection, has, happened, within, the, context, of, the, jewish, community, and, synagogue, including, through, rabbinical, discussion, of, jewish, law, and, midrash, rabbinic, biblical, commentaries, jewish, theology, is, also, linked, to, ethics, as, it, is, the, case, with, theology, in, other, religions, and, therefore, has, implications, for, how, one, behaves, some, academic, inquiries, within, buddhism, dedicated, to, the, investigation, of, a, buddhist, understanding, of, the, world, prefer, the, designation, buddhist, philosophy, to, the, term, buddhist, theology, since, buddhism, lacks, the, same, conception, of, a, theos, jose, ignacio, cabezon, who, argues, that, the, use, of, theology, is, in, fact, appropriate, can, only, do, so, he, says, because, i, take, theology, not, to, be, restricted, to, discourse, on, god, i, take, theology, not, to, be, restricted, to, its, etymological, meaning, in, that, latter, sense, buddhism, is, of, course, atheological, rejecting, as, it, does, the, notion, of, god, within, hindu, philosophy, there, is, a, tradition, of, philosophical, speculation, on, the, nature, of, the, universe, of, god, termed, brahman, paramatma, and, or, bhagavan, in, some, schools, of, hindu, thought, and, of, the, tman, soul, the, sanskrit, word, for, the, various, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, is, dar, ana, view, viewpoint, vaishnava, theology, has, been, a, subject, of, study, for, many, devotees, philosophers, and, scholars, in, india, for, centuries, a, large, part, of, its, study, lies, in, classifying, and, organizing, the, manifestations, of, thousands, of, gods, and, their, aspects, in, recent, decades, the, study, of, hinduism, has, also, been, taken, up, by, a, number, of, academic, institutions, in, europe, such, as, the, oxford, centre, for, hindu, studies, and, bhaktivedanta, college, in, japan, the, term, theology, shingaku, has, been, ascribed, to, shinto, since, the, edo, period, with, the, publication, of, mano, tokitsuna, s, kokon, shingaku, ruihen, categorized, compilation, of, ancient, theology, in, modern, times, other, terms, are, used, to, denote, studies, in, shinto, as, well, as, buddhist, belief, such, as, ky, gaku, doctrinal, studies, and, sh, gaku, denominational, studies, english, academic, graham, harvey, has, commented, that, pagans, rarely, indulge, in, theology, nevertheless, theology, has, been, applied, in, some, sectors, across, contemporary, pagan, communities, including, wicca, heathenry, druidry, and, kemetism, as, these, religions, have, given, precedence, to, orthopraxy, theological, views, often, vary, among, adherents, the, term, is, used, by, christine, kraemer, in, her, book, seeking, the, mystery, an, introduction, to, pagan, theologies, and, by, michael, york, in, pagan, theology, paganism, as, a, world, religion, richard, hooker, defines, theology, as, the, science, of, things, divine, the, term, can, however, be, used, for, a, variety, of, disciplines, or, fields, of, study, theology, considers, whether, the, divine, exists, in, some, form, such, as, in, physical, supernatural, mental, or, social, realities, and, what, evidence, for, and, about, it, may, be, found, via, personal, spiritual, experiences, or, historical, records, of, such, experiences, as, documented, by, others, the, study, of, these, assumptions, is, not, part, of, theology, proper, but, is, found, in, the, philosophy, of, religion, and, increasingly, through, the, psychology, of, religion, and, neurotheology, theology, s, aim, then, is, to, record, structure, and, understand, these, experiences, and, concepts, and, to, use, them, to, derive, normative, prescriptions, for, how, to, live, our, lives, the, history, of, the, study, of, theology, in, institutions, of, higher, education, is, as, old, as, the, history, of, such, institutions, themselves, for, instance, the, earliest, universities, were, developed, under, the, aegis, of, the, latin, church, by, papal, bull, as, studia, generalia, and, perhaps, from, cathedral, schools, it, is, possible, however, that, the, development, of, cathedral, schools, into, universities, was, quite, rare, with, the, university, of, paris, being, an, exception, later, they, were, also, founded, by, kings, university, of, naples, federico, ii, charles, university, in, prague, jagiellonian, university, in, krak, w, or, by, municipal, administrations, university, of, cologne, university, of, erfurt, in, the, early, medieval, period, most, new, universities, were, founded, from, pre, existing, schools, usually, when, these, schools, were, deemed, to, have, become, primarily, sites, of, higher, education, many, historians, state, that, universities, and, cathedral, schools, were, a, continuation, of, the, interest, in, learning, promoted, by, monasteries, christian, theological, learning, was, therefore, a, component, in, these, institutions, as, was, the, study, of, church, or, canon, law, universities, played, an, important, role, in, training, people, for, ecclesiastical, offices, in, helping, the, church, pursue, the, clarification, and, defence, of, its, teaching, and, in, supporting, the, legal, rights, of, the, church, over, against, secular, rulers, at, such, universities, theological, study, was, initially, closely, tied, to, the, life, of, faith, and, of, the, church, it, fed, and, was, fed, by, practices, of, preaching, prayer, and, celebration, of, the, mass, during, the, high, middle, ages, theology, was, the, ultimate, subject, at, universities, being, named, the, queen, of, the, sciences, it, served, as, the, capstone, to, the, trivium, and, quadrivium, that, young, men, were, expected, to, study, this, meant, that, the, other, subjects, including, philosophy, existed, primarily, to, help, with, theological, thought, in, this, context, medieval, theology, in, the, christian, west, could, subsume, fields, of, study, which, would, later, become, more, self, sufficient, such, as, metaphysics, aristotle, s, first, philosophy, or, ontology, the, science, of, being, christian, theology, s, preeminent, place, in, the, university, started, to, come, under, challenge, during, the, european, enlightenment, especially, in, germany, other, subjects, gained, in, independence, and, prestige, and, questions, were, raised, about, the, place, of, a, discipline, that, seemed, to, involve, a, commitment, to, the, authority, of, particular, religious, traditions, in, institutions, that, were, increasingly, understood, to, be, devoted, to, independent, reason, since, the, early, 19th, century, various, different, approaches, have, emerged, in, the, west, to, theology, as, an, academic, discipline, much, of, the, debate, concerning, theology, s, place, in, the, university, or, within, a, general, higher, education, curriculum, centres, on, whether, theology, s, methods, are, appropriately, theoretical, and, broadly, speaking, scientific, or, on, the, other, hand, whether, theology, requires, a, pre, commitment, of, faith, by, its, practitioners, and, whether, such, a, commitment, conflicts, with, academic, freedom, in, some, contexts, theology, has, been, held, to, belong, in, institutions, of, higher, education, primarily, as, a, form, of, professional, training, for, christian, ministry, this, was, the, basis, on, which, friedrich, schleiermacher, a, liberal, theologian, argued, for, the, inclusion, of, theology, in, the, new, university, of, berlin, in, 1810, ch, 14, for, instance, in, germany, theological, faculties, at, state, universities, are, typically, tied, to, particular, denominations, protestant, or, roman, catholic, and, those, faculties, will, offer, denominationally, bound, konfessionsgebunden, degrees, and, have, denominationally, bound, public, posts, amongst, their, faculty, as, well, as, contributing, to, the, development, and, growth, of, christian, knowledge, they, provide, the, academic, training, for, the, future, clergy, and, teachers, of, religious, instruction, at, german, schools, in, the, united, states, several, prominent, colleges, and, universities, were, started, in, order, to, train, christian, ministers, harvard, georgetown, boston, university, yale, duke, university, and, princeton, all, had, the, theological, training, of, clergy, as, a, primary, purpose, at, their, foundation, seminaries, and, bible, colleges, have, continued, this, alliance, between, the, academic, study, of, theology, and, training, for, christian, ministry, there, are, for, instance, numerous, prominent, examples, in, the, united, states, including, phoenix, seminary, catholic, theological, union, in, chicago, the, graduate, theological, union, in, berkeley, criswell, college, in, dallas, the, southern, baptist, theological, seminary, in, louisville, trinity, evangelical, divinity, school, in, deerfield, illinois, dallas, theological, seminary, north, texas, collegiate, institute, in, farmers, branch, texas, and, the, assemblies, of, god, theological, seminary, in, springfield, missouri, the, only, judeo, christian, seminary, for, theology, is, the, idaho, messianic, bible, seminary, which, is, part, of, the, jewish, university, of, colorado, in, denver, in, some, contexts, scholars, pursue, theology, as, an, academic, discipline, without, formal, affiliation, to, any, particular, church, though, members, of, staff, may, well, have, affiliations, to, churches, and, without, focussing, on, ministerial, training, this, applies, for, instance, to, the, department, of, theological, studies, at, concordia, university, in, canada, and, to, many, university, departments, in, the, united, kingdom, including, the, faculty, of, divinity, at, the, university, of, cambridge, the, department, of, theology, and, religion, at, the, university, of, exeter, and, the, department, of, theology, and, religious, studies, at, the, university, of, leeds, traditional, academic, prizes, such, as, the, university, of, aberdeen, s, lumsden, and, sachs, fellowship, tend, to, acknowledge, performance, in, theology, or, divinity, as, it, is, known, at, aberdeen, and, in, religious, studies, in, some, contemporary, contexts, a, distinction, is, made, between, theology, which, is, seen, as, involving, some, level, of, commitment, to, the, claims, of, the, religious, tradition, being, studied, and, religious, studies, which, by, contrast, is, normally, seen, as, requiring, that, the, question, of, the, truth, or, falsehood, of, the, religious, traditions, studied, be, kept, outside, its, field, religious, studies, involves, the, study, of, historical, or, contemporary, practices, or, of, those, traditions, ideas, using, intellectual, tools, and, frameworks, that, are, not, themselves, specifically, tied, to, any, religious, tradition, and, that, are, normally, understood, to, be, neutral, or, secular, in, contexts, where, religious, studies, in, this, sense, is, the, focus, the, primary, forms, of, study, are, likely, to, include, sometimes, theology, and, religious, studies, are, seen, as, being, in, tension, and, at, other, times, they, are, held, to, coexist, without, serious, tension, occasionally, it, is, denied, that, there, is, as, clear, a, boundary, between, them, whether, or, not, reasoned, discussion, about, the, divine, is, possible, has, long, been, a, point, of, contention, protagoras, as, early, as, the, fifth, century, bc, who, is, reputed, to, have, been, exiled, from, athens, because, of, his, agnosticism, about, the, existence, of, the, gods, said, that, concerning, the, gods, i, cannot, know, either, that, they, exist, or, that, they, do, not, exist, or, what, form, they, might, have, for, there, is, much, to, prevent, one, s, knowing, the, obscurity, of, the, subject, and, the, shortness, of, man, s, life, since, at, least, the, eighteenth, century, various, authors, have, criticized, the, suitability, of, theology, as, an, academic, discipline, in, 1772, baron, d, holbach, labeled, theology, a, continual, insult, to, human, reason, in, le, bon, sens, lord, bolingbroke, an, english, politician, and, political, philosopher, wrote, in, section, iv, of, his, essays, on, human, knowledge, theology, is, in, fault, not, religion, theology, is, a, science, that, may, justly, be, compared, to, the, box, of, pandora, many, good, things, lie, uppermost, in, it, but, many, evil, lie, under, them, and, scatter, plagues, and, desolation, throughout, the, world, thomas, paine, a, deistic, american, political, theorist, and, pamphleteer, wrote, in, his, three, part, work, the, age, of, reason, 1794, 1795, 1807, the, study, of, theology, as, it, stands, in, christian, churches, is, the, study, of, nothing, it, is, founded, on, nothing, it, rests, on, no, principles, it, proceeds, by, no, authorities, it, has, no, data, it, can, demonstrate, nothing, and, it, admits, of, no, conclusion, not, anything, can, be, studied, as, a, science, without, our, being, in, possession, of, the, principles, upon, which, it, is, founded, and, as, this, is, the, case, with, christian, theology, it, is, therefore, the, study, of, nothing, the, german, atheist, philosopher, ludwig, feuerbach, sought, to, dissolve, theology, in, his, work, principles, of, the, philosophy, of, the, future, the, task, of, the, modern, era, was, the, realization, and, humanization, of, god, the, transformation, and, dissolution, of, theology, into, anthropology, this, mirrored, his, earlier, work, the, essence, of, christianity, 1841, for, which, he, was, banned, from, teaching, in, germany, in, which, he, had, said, that, theology, was, a, web, of, contradictions, and, delusions, the, american, satirist, mark, twain, remarked, in, his, essay, the, lowest, animal, originally, written, in, around, 1896, but, not, published, until, after, twain, s, death, in, 1910, that, is, the, only, animal, that, loves, his, neighbor, as, himself, and, cuts, his, throat, if, his, theology, isn, t, straight, he, has, made, a, graveyard, of, the, globe, in, trying, his, honest, best, to, smooth, his, brother, s, path, to, happiness, and, heaven, the, higher, animals, have, no, religion, and, we, are, told, that, they, are, going, to, be, left, out, in, the, hereafter, i, wonder, why, it, seems, questionable, taste, a, j, ayer, a, british, former, logical, positivist, sought, to, show, in, his, essay, critique, of, ethics, and, theology, that, all, statements, about, the, divine, are, nonsensical, and, any, divine, attribute, is, unprovable, he, wrote, it, is, now, generally, admitted, at, any, rate, by, philosophers, that, the, existence, of, a, being, having, the, attributes, which, define, the, god, of, any, non, animistic, religion, cannot, be, demonstratively, proved, ll, utterances, about, the, nature, of, god, are, nonsensical, jewish, atheist, philosopher, walter, kaufmann, in, his, essay, against, theology, sought, to, differentiate, theology, from, religion, in, general, theology, of, course, is, not, religion, and, a, great, deal, of, religion, is, emphatically, anti, theological, an, attack, on, theology, therefore, should, not, be, taken, as, necessarily, involving, an, attack, on, religion, religion, can, be, and, often, has, been, untheological, or, even, anti, theological, however, kaufmann, found, that, christianity, is, inescapably, a, theological, religion, english, atheist, charles, bradlaugh, believed, theology, prevented, human, beings, from, achieving, liberty, although, he, also, noted, that, many, theologians, of, his, time, held, that, because, modern, scientific, research, sometimes, contradicts, sacred, scriptures, the, scriptures, must, therefore, be, wrong, robert, g, ingersoll, an, american, agnostic, lawyer, stated, that, when, theologians, had, power, the, majority, of, people, lived, in, hovels, while, a, privileged, few, had, palaces, and, cathedrals, in, ingersoll, s, opinion, it, was, science, that, improved, people, s, lives, not, theology, ingersoll, further, maintained, that, trained, theologians, reason, no, better, than, a, person, who, assumes, the, devil, must, exist, because, pictures, resemble, the, devil, so, exactly, the, british, evolutionary, biologist, richard, dawkins, has, been, an, outspoken, critic, of, theology, in, an, article, published, in, the, independent, in, 1993, he, severely, criticizes, theology, as, entirely, useless, declaring, that, it, has, completely, and, repeatedly, failed, to, answer, any, questions, about, the, nature, of, reality, or, the, human, condition, he, states, i, have, never, heard, any, of, them, ever, say, anything, of, the, smallest, use, anything, that, was, not, either, platitudinously, obvious, or, downright, false, he, then, states, that, if, all, theology, were, completely, eradicated, from, the, earth, no, one, would, notice, or, even, care, he, concludes, the, achievements, of, theologians, don, t, do, anything, don, t, affect, anything, don, t, achieve, anything, don, t, even, mean, anything, what, makes, you, think, that, theology, is, a, subject, at, all
