a, zombie, haitian, french, zombi, haitian, creole, zonbi, kikongo, zumbi, is, a, mythological, undead, corporeal, revenant, created, through, the, reanimation, of, a, corpse, in, modern, popular, culture, zombies, are, most, commonly, found, in, horror, genre, works, the, term, comes, from, haitian, folklore, in, which, a, zombie, is, a, dead, body, reanimated, through, various, methods, most, commonly, magical, practices, in, religions, like, vodou, modern, media, depictions, of, the, reanimation, of, the, dead, often, do, not, involve, magic, but, rather, science, fictional, methods, such, as, fungi, radiation, gases, diseases, plants, bacteria, viruses, etc, the, english, word, zombie, was, first, recorded, in, 1819, in, a, history, of, brazil, by, the, poet, robert, southey, in, the, form, of, zombi, dictionaries, trace, the, word, s, origin, to, african, languages, relating, to, words, connected, to, gods, ghosts, and, souls, one, of, the, first, books, to, expose, western, culture, to, the, concept, of, the, voodoo, zombie, was, w, b, seabrook, s, the, magic, island, 1929, the, account, of, a, narrator, who, encounters, voodoo, cults, in, haiti, and, their, resurrected, thralls, a, new, version, of, the, zombie, distinct, from, that, described, in, haitian, folklore, emerged, in, popular, culture, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, this, interpretation, of, the, zombie, as, an, undead, person, that, attacks, and, eats, the, flesh, of, living, people, is, drawn, largely, from, george, a, romero, s, film, night, of, the, living, dead, 1968, which, was, partly, inspired, by, richard, matheson, s, novel, i, am, legend, 1954, the, word, zombie, is, not, used, in, night, of, the, living, dead, but, was, applied, later, by, fans, following, the, release, of, such, zombie, films, as, dawn, of, the, dead, 1978, and, the, return, of, the, living, dead, 1985, the, latter, of, which, introduced, the, concept, of, zombies, that, eat, brains, as, well, as, michael, jackson, s, music, video, thriller, 1983, the, genre, waned, for, some, years, the, mid, 1990s, saw, the, introduction, of, resident, evil, and, the, house, of, the, dead, two, break, out, successes, of, video, games, featuring, zombie, enemies, which, would, later, go, on, to, become, highly, influential, and, well, known, these, games, were, initially, followed, by, a, wave, of, low, budget, asian, zombie, films, such, as, the, zombie, comedy, bio, zombie, 1998, and, action, film, versus, 2000, and, then, a, new, wave, of, popular, western, zombie, films, in, the, early, 2000s, the, resident, evil, and, house, of, the, dead, films, the, 2004, dawn, of, the, dead, remake, and, the, british, zombie, comedy, shaun, of, the, dead, 2004, the, zombie, apocalypse, concept, in, which, the, civilized, world, is, brought, low, by, a, global, zombie, infestation, has, since, become, a, staple, of, modern, zombie, media, seen, in, such, media, as, the, walking, dead, franchise, the, late, 2000s, and, 2010s, saw, the, humanization, and, romanticization, of, the, zombie, archetype, with, the, zombies, increasingly, portrayed, as, friends, and, love, interests, for, humans, notable, examples, of, the, latter, include, movies, warm, bodies, and, zombies, novels, american, gods, by, neil, gaiman, generation, dead, by, daniel, waters, and, bone, song, by, john, meaney, animated, movie, corpse, bride, tv, series, izombie, manga, series, sankarea, undying, love, and, the, light, novel, is, this, a, zombie, in, this, context, zombies, are, often, seen, as, stand, ins, for, discriminated, groups, struggling, for, equality, and, the, human, zombie, romantic, relationship, is, interpreted, as, a, metaphor, for, sexual, liberation, and, taboo, breaking, given, that, zombies, are, subject, to, wild, desires, and, free, from, social, conventions, in, haitian, folklore, a, zombie, haitian, french, zombi, haitian, creole, zonbi, is, an, animated, corpse, raised, by, magical, means, such, as, witchcraft, the, english, word, zombie, is, first, recorded, in, 1819, in, a, history, of, brazil, by, the, poet, robert, southey, in, the, form, of, zombi, actually, referring, to, the, afro, brazilian, rebel, leader, named, zumbi, and, the, etymology, of, his, name, in, nzambi, the, oxford, english, dictionary, gives, the, origin, of, the, word, as, central, african, and, compares, it, to, the, kongo, words, nzambi, god, and, zumbi, fetish, a, kimbundu, to, portuguese, dictionary, from, 1903, defines, the, related, word, nzumbi, as, soul, while, a, later, kimbundu, portuguese, dictionary, defines, it, as, being, a, spirit, that, is, supposed, to, wander, the, earth, to, torment, the, living, how, the, creatures, in, contemporary, zombie, films, came, to, be, called, zombies, is, not, fully, clear, the, film, night, of, the, living, dead, 1968, made, no, spoken, reference, to, its, undead, antagonists, as, zombies, describing, them, instead, as, ghouls, though, ghouls, which, derive, from, arabic, folklore, are, demons, not, undead, although, george, a, romero, used, the, term, ghoul, in, his, original, scripts, in, later, interviews, he, used, the, term, zombie, the, word, zombie, is, used, exclusively, by, romero, in, his, script, for, his, sequel, dawn, of, the, dead, 1978, including, once, in, dialog, according, to, romero, film, critics, were, influential, in, associating, the, term, zombie, to, his, creatures, and, especially, the, french, magazine, cahiers, du, cin, ma, he, eventually, accepted, this, linkage, even, though, he, remained, convinced, at, the, time, that, zombies, corresponded, to, the, undead, slaves, of, haitian, voodoo, as, depicted, in, white, zombie, with, bela, lugosi, zombies, are, featured, widely, in, haitian, rural, folklore, as, dead, persons, physically, revived, by, the, act, of, necromancy, of, a, bokor, a, sorcerer, or, witch, the, bokor, is, opposed, by, the, houngan, priest, and, the, mambo, priestess, of, the, formal, voodoo, religion, a, zombie, remains, under, the, control, of, the, bokor, as, a, personal, slave, having, no, will, of, its, own, the, haitian, tradition, also, includes, an, incorporeal, type, of, zombie, the, zombie, astral, which, is, a, part, of, the, human, soul, a, bokor, can, capture, a, zombie, astral, to, enhance, his, spiritual, power, a, zombie, astral, can, also, be, sealed, inside, a, specially, decorated, bottle, by, a, bokor, and, sold, to, a, client, to, bring, luck, healing, or, business, success, it, is, believed, that, god, eventually, will, reclaim, the, zombie, s, soul, so, the, zombie, is, a, temporary, spiritual, entity, the, two, types, of, zombie, reflect, soul, dualism, a, belief, of, bakongo, religion, and, haitian, voodoo, each, type, of, legendary, zombie, is, therefore, missing, one, half, of, its, soul, the, flesh, or, the, spirit, the, zombie, belief, has, its, roots, in, traditions, brought, to, haiti, by, enslaved, africans, and, their, subsequent, experiences, in, the, new, world, it, was, thought, that, the, voodoo, deity, baron, samedi, would, gather, them, from, their, grave, to, bring, them, to, a, heavenly, afterlife, in, africa, guinea, unless, they, had, offended, him, in, some, way, in, which, case, they, would, be, forever, a, slave, after, death, as, a, zombie, a, zombie, could, also, be, saved, by, feeding, them, salt, english, professor, amy, wilentz, has, written, that, the, modern, concept, of, zombies, was, strongly, influenced, by, haitian, slavery, slave, drivers, on, the, plantations, who, were, usually, slaves, themselves, and, sometimes, voodoo, priests, used, the, fear, of, zombification, to, discourage, slaves, from, committing, suicide, while, most, scholars, have, associated, the, haitian, zombie, with, african, cultures, a, connection, has, also, been, suggested, to, the, island, s, indigenous, ta, no, people, partly, based, on, an, early, account, of, native, shamanist, practices, written, by, ram, n, pan, a, monk, of, the, hieronymite, religious, order, and, companion, of, christopher, columbus, the, haitian, zombie, phenomenon, first, attracted, widespread, international, attention, during, the, united, states, occupation, of, haiti, 1915, 1934, when, a, number, of, case, histories, of, purported, zombies, began, to, emerge, the, first, popular, book, covering, the, topic, was, william, seabrook, s, the, magic, island, 1929, seabrooke, cited, article, 246, of, the, haitian, criminal, code, which, was, passed, in, 1864, asserting, that, it, was, an, official, recognition, of, zombies, this, passage, was, later, used, in, promotional, materials, for, the, 1932, film, white, zombie, also, shall, be, qualified, as, attempted, murder, the, employment, which, may, be, made, by, any, person, of, substances, which, without, causing, actual, death, produce, a, lethargic, coma, more, or, less, prolonged, if, after, the, administering, of, such, substances, the, person, has, been, buried, the, act, shall, be, considered, murder, no, matter, what, result, follows, in, 1937, while, researching, folklore, in, haiti, zora, neale, hurston, encountered, the, case, of, a, woman, who, appeared, in, a, village, a, family, claimed, that, she, was, felicia, felix, mentor, a, relative, who, had, died, and, been, buried, in, 1907, at, the, age, of, 29, the, woman, was, examined, by, a, doctor, x, rays, indicated, that, she, did, not, have, a, leg, fracture, that, felix, mentor, was, known, to, have, had, hurston, pursued, rumors, that, affected, persons, were, given, a, powerful, psychoactive, drug, but, she, was, unable, to, locate, individuals, willing, to, offer, much, information, she, wrote, what, is, more, if, science, ever, gets, to, the, bottom, of, vodou, in, haiti, and, africa, it, will, be, found, that, some, important, medical, secrets, still, unknown, to, medical, science, give, it, its, power, rather, than, gestures, of, ceremony, a, central, african, origin, for, the, haitian, zombie, has, been, postulated, based, on, two, etymologies, in, the, kongo, language, nzambi, god, and, zumbi, fetish, this, root, helps, form, the, names, of, several, deities, including, the, kongo, creator, deity, nzambi, mpungu, and, the, louisiana, serpent, deity, li, grand, zombi, a, local, version, of, the, haitian, damballa, but, it, is, in, fact, a, generic, word, for, a, divine, spirit, the, common, african, conception, of, beings, under, these, names, is, more, similar, to, the, incorporeal, zombie, astral, as, in, the, kongo, nkisi, spirits, a, related, but, also, often, incorporeal, undead, being, is, the, jumbee, of, the, english, speaking, caribbean, considered, to, be, of, the, same, etymology, in, the, french, west, indies, also, local, zombies, are, recognized, but, these, are, of, a, more, general, spirit, nature, the, idea, of, physical, zombie, like, creatures, is, present, in, some, south, african, cultures, where, they, are, called, xidachane, in, sotho, tsonga, and, maduxwane, in, venda, in, some, communities, it, is, believed, that, a, dead, person, can, be, zombified, by, a, small, child, it, is, said, that, the, spell, can, be, broken, by, a, powerful, enough, sangoma, it, is, also, believed, in, some, areas, of, south, africa, that, witches, can, zombify, a, person, by, killing, and, possessing, the, victim, s, body, to, force, it, into, slave, labor, after, rail, lines, were, built, to, transport, migrant, workers, stories, emerged, about, witch, trains, these, trains, appeared, ordinary, but, were, staffed, by, zombified, workers, controlled, by, a, witch, the, trains, would, abduct, a, person, boarding, at, night, and, the, person, would, then, either, be, zombified, or, beaten, and, thrown, from, the, train, a, distance, away, from, the, original, location, several, decades, after, hurston, s, work, wade, davis, a, harvard, ethnobotanist, presented, a, pharmacological, case, for, zombies, in, a, 1983, article, in, the, journal, of, ethnopharmacology, and, later, in, two, popular, books, the, serpent, and, the, rainbow, 1985, and, passage, of, darkness, the, ethnobiology, of, the, haitian, zombie, 1988, davis, traveled, to, haiti, in, 1982, and, as, a, result, of, his, investigations, claimed, that, a, living, person, can, be, turned, into, a, zombie, by, two, special, powders, being, introduced, into, the, bloodstream, usually, through, a, wound, the, first, french, coup, de, poudre, powder, strike, includes, tetrodotoxin, ttx, a, powerful, and, frequently, fatal, neurotoxin, found, in, the, flesh, of, the, pufferfish, family, tetraodontidae, the, second, powder, consists, of, deliriant, drugs, such, as, datura, together, these, powders, were, said, to, induce, a, deathlike, state, in, which, the, will, of, the, victim, would, be, entirely, subjected, to, that, of, the, bokor, davis, also, popularized, the, story, of, clairvius, narcisse, who, was, claimed, to, have, succumbed, to, this, practice, the, most, ethically, questioned, and, least, scientifically, explored, ingredient, of, the, powders, is, part, of, a, recently, buried, child, s, brain, the, process, described, by, davis, was, an, initial, state, of, deathlike, suspended, animation, followed, by, re, awakening, typically, after, being, buried, into, a, psychotic, state, the, psychosis, induced, by, the, drug, and, psychological, trauma, was, hypothesised, by, davis, to, reinforce, culturally, learned, beliefs, and, to, cause, the, individual, to, reconstruct, their, identity, as, that, of, a, zombie, since, they, knew, that, they, were, dead, and, had, no, other, role, to, play, in, the, haitian, society, societal, reinforcement, of, the, belief, was, hypothesized, by, davis, to, confirm, for, the, zombie, individual, the, zombie, state, and, such, individuals, were, known, to, hang, around, in, graveyards, exhibiting, attitudes, of, low, affect, davis, s, claim, has, been, criticized, particularly, the, suggestion, that, haitian, witch, doctors, can, keep, zombies, in, a, state, of, pharmacologically, induced, trance, for, many, years, symptoms, of, ttx, poisoning, range, from, numbness, and, nausea, to, paralysis, particularly, of, the, muscles, of, the, diaphragm, unconsciousness, and, death, but, do, not, include, a, stiffened, gait, or, a, deathlike, trance, according, to, psychologist, terence, hines, the, scientific, community, dismisses, tetrodotoxin, as, the, cause, of, this, state, and, davis, assessment, of, the, nature, of, the, reports, of, haitian, zombies, is, viewed, as, overly, credulous, scottish, psychiatrist, r, d, laing, highlighted, the, link, between, social, and, cultural, expectations, and, compulsion, in, the, context, of, schizophrenia, and, other, mental, illness, suggesting, that, schizogenesis, may, account, for, some, of, the, psychological, aspects, of, zombification, particularly, this, suggests, cases, where, schizophrenia, manifests, a, state, of, catatonia, roland, littlewood, professor, of, anthropology, and, psychiatry, published, a, study, supporting, a, social, explanation, of, the, zombie, phenomenon, in, the, medical, journal, the, lancet, in, 1997, the, social, explanation, sees, observed, cases, of, people, identified, as, zombies, as, a, culture, bound, syndrome, with, a, particular, cultural, form, of, adoption, practiced, in, haiti, that, unites, the, homeless, and, mentally, ill, with, grieving, families, who, see, them, as, their, returned, lost, loved, ones, as, littlewood, summarizes, his, findings, in, an, article, in, times, higher, education, i, came, to, the, conclusion, that, although, it, is, unlikely, that, there, is, a, single, explanation, for, all, cases, where, zombies, are, recognised, by, locals, in, haiti, the, mistaken, identification, of, a, wandering, mentally, ill, stranger, by, bereaved, relatives, is, the, most, likely, explanation, in, many, cases, people, with, a, chronic, schizophrenic, illness, brain, damage, or, learning, disability, are, not, uncommon, in, rural, haiti, and, they, would, be, particularly, likely, to, be, identified, as, zombies, pulliam, and, fonseca, 2014, and, walz, 2006, trace, the, zombie, lineage, back, to, ancient, mesopotamia, in, the, descent, of, ishtar, the, goddess, ishtar, threatens, if, you, do, not, open, the, gate, for, me, to, come, in, i, shall, smash, the, door, and, shatter, the, bolt, i, shall, smash, the, doorpost, and, overturn, the, doors, i, shall, raise, up, the, dead, and, they, shall, eat, the, living, and, the, dead, shall, outnumber, the, living, she, repeats, this, same, threat, in, a, slightly, modified, form, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, one, of, the, first, books, to, expose, western, culture, to, the, concept, of, the, voodoo, zombie, was, the, magic, island, 1929, by, w, b, seabrook, this, is, the, sensationalized, account, of, a, narrator, who, encounters, voodoo, cults, in, haiti, and, their, resurrected, thralls, time, commented, that, the, book, introduced, zombi, into, u, s, speech, zombies, have, a, complex, literary, heritage, with, antecedents, ranging, from, richard, matheson, and, h, p, lovecraft, to, mary, shelley, s, frankenstein, drawing, on, european, folklore, of, the, undead, victor, halperin, directed, white, zombie, 1932, a, horror, film, starring, bela, lugosi, here, zombies, are, depicted, as, mindless, unthinking, henchmen, under, the, spell, of, an, evil, magician, zombies, often, still, using, this, voodoo, inspired, rationale, were, initially, uncommon, in, cinema, but, their, appearances, continued, sporadically, through, the, 1930s, to, the, 1960s, with, films, including, i, walked, with, a, zombie, 1943, and, plan, 9, from, outer, space, 1959, frankenstein, by, mary, shelley, while, not, a, zombie, novel, per, se, foreshadows, many, 20th, century, ideas, about, zombies, in, that, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, is, portrayed, as, a, scientific, process, rather, than, a, mystical, one, and, that, the, resurrected, dead, are, degraded, and, more, violent, than, their, living, selves, frankenstein, published, in, 1818, has, its, roots, in, european, folklore, whose, tales, of, the, vengeful, dead, also, informed, the, evolution, of, the, modern, conception, of, the, vampire, later, notable, 19th, century, stories, about, the, avenging, undead, included, ambrose, bierce, s, the, death, of, halpin, frayser, and, various, gothic, romanticism, tales, by, edgar, allan, poe, though, their, works, could, not, be, properly, considered, zombie, fiction, the, supernatural, tales, of, bierce, and, poe, would, prove, influential, on, later, writers, such, as, h, p, lovecraft, by, lovecraft, s, own, admission, in, the, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, lovecraft, wrote, several, novellae, that, explored, the, undead, theme, cool, air, in, the, vault, and, the, outsider, all, deal, with, the, undead, but, lovecraft, s, herbert, west, reanimator, 1921, helped, define, zombies, in, popular, culture, this, series, of, short, stories, featured, herbert, west, a, mad, scientist, who, attempts, to, revive, human, corpses, with, mixed, results, notably, the, resurrected, dead, are, uncontrollable, mostly, mute, primitive, and, extremely, violent, though, they, are, not, referred, to, as, zombies, their, portrayal, was, prescient, anticipating, the, modern, conception, of, zombies, by, several, decades, edgar, rice, burroughs, similarly, depicted, animated, corpses, in, the, second, book, of, his, venus, series, again, without, using, the, terms, zombie, or, undead, avenging, zombies, would, feature, prominently, in, the, early, 1950s, ec, comics, which, george, a, romero, would, later, claim, as, an, influence, the, comics, including, tales, from, the, crypt, the, vault, of, horror, and, weird, science, featured, avenging, undead, in, the, gothic, tradition, quite, regularly, including, adaptations, of, lovecraft, s, stories, which, included, in, the, vault, cool, air, and, herbert, west, reanimator, richard, matheson, s, 1954, novel, i, am, legend, although, classified, as, a, vampire, story, had, a, great, impact, on, the, zombie, genre, by, way, of, george, a, romero, the, novel, and, its, 1964, film, adaptation, the, last, man, on, earth, which, concern, a, lone, human, survivor, waging, war, against, a, world, of, vampires, would, by, romero, s, own, admission, greatly, influence, his, 1968, low, budget, film, night, of, the, living, dead, a, work, that, was, more, influential, on, the, concept, of, zombies, than, any, literary, or, cinematic, work, before, it, the, monsters, in, the, film, and, its, sequels, such, as, dawn, of, the, dead, 1978, and, day, of, the, dead, 1985, as, well, as, the, many, zombie, films, it, inspired, such, as, the, return, of, the, living, dead, 1985, and, zombi, 2, 1979, are, usually, hungry, for, human, flesh, although, return, of, the, living, dead, introduced, the, popular, concept, of, zombies, eating, human, brains, there, has, been, an, evolution, in, the, zombie, archetype, from, supernatural, to, scientific, themes, i, am, legend, and, night, of, the, living, dead, began, the, shift, away, from, haitian, dark, magic, though, did, not, give, scientific, explanations, for, zombie, origins, a, more, decisive, shift, towards, scientific, themes, came, with, the, resident, evil, video, game, series, in, the, late, 1990s, which, gave, more, realistic, scientific, explanations, for, zombie, origins, while, drawing, on, modern, science, and, technology, such, as, biological, weaponry, genetic, manipulation, and, parasitic, symbiosis, this, became, the, standard, approach, for, explaining, zombie, origins, in, popular, fiction, that, followed, resident, evil, there, has, also, been, shift, towards, an, action, approach, which, has, led, to, another, evolution, of, the, zombie, archietype, the, fast, zombie, or, running, zombie, in, contrast, to, romero, s, classic, slow, zombies, fast, zombies, can, run, are, more, aggressive, and, are, often, more, intelligent, this, type, of, zombie, has, origins, in, 1990s, japanese, horror, video, games, in, 1996, capcom, s, survival, horror, video, game, resident, evil, featured, zombie, dogs, that, run, towards, the, player, later, the, same, year, sega, s, arcade, shooter, the, house, of, the, dead, introduced, running, human, zombies, who, run, towards, the, player, and, can, also, jump, and, swim, the, running, human, zombies, introduced, in, the, house, of, the, dead, video, games, became, the, basis, for, the, fast, zombies, that, became, popular, in, zombie, films, during, the, early, 21st, century, starting, with, 28, days, later, 2002, the, resident, evil, and, house, of, the, dead, films, and, the, 2004, dawn, of, the, dead, remake, these, films, also, adopted, an, action, approach, to, the, zombie, concept, which, was, also, influenced, by, the, resident, evil, and, house, of, the, dead, video, games, films, featuring, zombies, have, been, a, part, of, cinema, since, the, 1930s, white, zombie, directed, by, victor, halperin, in, 1932, and, i, walked, with, a, zombie, directed, by, jacques, tourneur, 1943, were, early, examples, with, george, a, romero, s, night, of, the, living, dead, 1968, the, zombie, trope, began, to, be, increasingly, linked, to, consumerism, and, consumer, culture, today, zombie, films, are, released, with, such, regularity, at, least, 50, films, were, released, in, 2014, alone, that, they, constitute, a, separate, subgenre, of, horror, film, voodoo, related, zombie, themes, have, also, appeared, in, espionage, or, adventure, themed, works, outside, the, horror, genre, for, example, the, original, jonny, quest, series, 1964, and, the, james, bond, novel, live, and, let, die, as, well, as, its, film, adaptation, both, feature, caribbean, villains, who, falsely, claim, the, voodoo, power, of, zombification, to, keep, others, in, fear, of, them, george, romero, s, modern, zombie, archetype, in, night, of, the, living, dead, was, influenced, by, several, earlier, zombie, themed, films, including, white, zombie, revolt, of, the, zombies, 1936, and, the, plague, of, the, zombies, 1966, romero, was, also, inspired, by, richard, matheson, s, novel, i, am, legend, 1954, along, with, its, film, adaptation, the, last, man, on, earth, 1964, the, modern, conception, of, the, zombie, owes, itself, almost, entirely, to, george, a, romero, s, 1968, film, night, of, the, living, dead, in, his, films, romero, bred, the, zombie, with, the, vampire, and, what, he, got, was, the, hybrid, vigour, of, a, ghoulish, plague, monster, this, entailed, an, apocalyptic, vision, of, monsters, that, have, come, to, be, known, as, romero, zombies, roger, ebert, of, the, chicago, sun, times, chided, theater, owners, and, parents, who, allowed, children, access, to, the,

zombies, are, portrayed, as, humanlike, in, appearance, and, behavior, retaining, the, personality, traits, they, had, in, life, and, becoming, friends, or, even, romantic, partners, for, humans, rather, than, a, threat, to, humanity, notable, examples, of, human, zombie, romance, include, the, stop, motion, animated, movie, corpse, bride, live, action, movies, warm, bodies, camille, life, after, beth, burying, the, ex, and, nina, forever, and, tv, series, pushing, daisies, and, babylon, fields, according, to, zombie, scholar, scott, rogers, what, we, are, seeing, in, pushing, daisies, warm, bodies, and, izombie, is, in, many, ways, the, same, transformation, that, we, have, witnessed, with, vampires, since, the, 1931, dracula, represented, dracula, as, essentially, human, a, significant, departure, from, the, monstrous, representation, in, the, 1922, film, nosferatu, rogers, also, notes, the, accompanying, visual, transformation, of, the, living, dead, while, the, traditional, zombies, are, marked, by, noticeable, disfigurement, and, decomposition, the, romantic, zombies, show, little, or, no, such, traits, in, the, late, 2010s, zombie, films, began, declining, in, popularity, with, elevated, horror, films, gradually, taking, their, place, such, as, the, witch, 2015, get, out, 2017, a, quiet, place, 2018, and, hereditary, 2018, an, exception, is, the, low, budget, japanese, zombie, comedy, one, cut, of, the, dead, 2017, which, became, a, sleeper, hit, in, japan, and, it, made, box, office, history, by, earning, over, a, thousand, times, its, budget, one, cut, of, the, dead, also, received, worldwide, acclaim, with, rotten, tomatoes, stating, that, it, reanimates, the, moribund, zombie, genre, with, a, refreshing, blend, of, formal, daring, and, clever, satire, the, romantic, zombie, angle, still, remains, popular, however, the, late, 2010s, and, early, 2020s, saw, the, release, of, the, tv, series, american, gods, and, izombie, as, well, as, the, 2018, disney, channel, original, movie, zombies, and, sequels, zombies, 2, 2020, and, zombies, 3, 2022, intimately, tied, to, the, concept, of, the, modern, zombie, is, that, of, the, zombie, apocalypse, the, breakdown, of, society, as, a, result, of, an, initial, zombie, outbreak, that, spreads, quickly, this, archetype, has, emerged, as, a, prolific, subgenre, of, apocalyptic, fiction, and, has, been, portrayed, in, many, zombie, related, media, after, night, of, the, living, dead, in, a, zombie, apocalypse, a, widespread, usually, global, rise, of, zombies, hostile, to, human, life, engages, in, a, general, assault, on, civilization, victims, of, zombies, may, become, zombies, themselves, this, causes, the, outbreak, to, become, an, exponentially, growing, crisis, the, spreading, phenomenon, swamps, normal, military, and, law, enforcement, organizations, leading, to, the, panicked, collapse, of, civilized, society, until, only, isolated, pockets, of, survivors, remain, scavenging, for, food, and, supplies, in, a, world, reduced, to, a, pre, industrial, hostile, wilderness, possible, causes, for, zombie, behavior, in, a, modern, population, can, be, attributed, to, viruses, bacteria, or, other, phenomena, that, reduce, the, mental, capacity, of, humans, causing, them, to, behave, in, a, very, primitive, and, destructive, fashion, the, usual, subtext, of, the, zombie, apocalypse, is, that, civilization, is, inherently, vulnerable, to, the, unexpected, and, that, most, individuals, if, desperate, enough, cannot, be, relied, on, to, comply, with, the, author, s, ethos, the, narrative, of, a, zombie, apocalypse, carries, strong, connections, to, the, turbulent, social, landscape, of, the, united, states, in, the, 1960s, when, night, of, the, living, dead, provided, an, indirect, commentary, on, the, dangers, of, conformity, a, theme, also, explored, in, the, novel, the, body, snatchers, 1954, and, associated, film, invasion, of, the, body, snatchers, 1956, many, also, feel, that, zombies, allow, people, to, deal, with, their, own, anxieties, about, the, end, of, the, world, one, scholar, concluded, that, more, than, any, other, monster, zombies, are, fully, and, literally, apocalyptic, they, signal, the, end, of, the, world, as, we, have, known, it, while, zombie, apocalypse, scenarios, are, secular, they, follow, a, religious, pattern, based, on, christian, ideas, of, an, end, times, war, and, messiah, simon, pegg, who, starred, in, and, co, wrote, the, 2004, zombie, comedy, film, shaun, of, the, dead, wrote, that, zombies, were, the, most, potent, metaphorical, monster, according, to, pegg, whereas, vampires, represent, sex, zombies, represent, death, slow, and, steady, in, their, approach, weak, clumsy, often, absurd, the, zombie, relentlessly, closes, in, unstoppable, intractable, he, expressed, his, dislike, for, the, trend, for, fast, zombies, and, argued, that, they, should, be, slow, and, inept, just, as, a, healthy, diet, and, exercise, can, delay, death, zombies, are, easy, to, avoid, but, not, forever, he, also, argued, that, this, was, essential, for, making, them, oddly, sympathetic, to, create, tragic, anti, heroes, to, be, pitied, empathised, with, even, rooted, for, the, moment, they, appear, angry, or, petulant, the, second, they, emit, furious, velociraptor, screeches, as, opposed, to, the, correct, mournful, moans, of, longing, they, cease, to, possess, any, ambiguity, they, are, simply, mean, the, stories, usually, follow, a, single, group, of, survivors, caught, up, in, the, sudden, rush, of, the, crisis, the, narrative, generally, progresses, from, the, onset, of, the, zombie, plague, then, initial, attempts, to, seek, the, aid, of, authorities, the, failure, of, those, authorities, through, to, the, sudden, catastrophic, collapse, of, all, large, scale, organization, and, the, characters, subsequent, attempts, to, survive, on, their, own, such, stories, are, often, squarely, focused, on, the, way, their, characters, react, to, such, an, extreme, catastrophe, and, how, their, personalities, are, changed, by, the, stress, often, acting, on, more, primal, motivations, fear, self, preservation, than, they, would, display, in, normal, life, in, the, 1990s, zombie, fiction, emerged, as, a, distinct, literary, subgenre, with, the, publication, of, book, of, the, dead, 1990, and, its, follow, up, still, dead, book, of, the, dead, 2, 1992, both, edited, by, horror, authors, john, skipp, and, craig, spector, featuring, romero, inspired, stories,
