counseling, give, spiritual, direction, teach, catechism, or, visit, those, confined, indoors, such, as, the, sick, in, hospitals, and, nursing, homes, according, to, the, trifunctional, hypothesis, of, prehistoric, proto, indo, european, society, priests, have, existed, since, the, earliest, of, times, and, in, the, simplest, societies, most, likely, as, a, result, of, agricultural, surplus, and, consequent, social, stratification, the, necessity, to, read, sacred, texts, and, keep, temple, or, church, records, helped, foster, literacy, in, many, early, societies, priests, exist, in, many, religions, today, such, as, all, or, some, branches, of, judaism, christianity, buddhism, shinto, and, hinduism, they, are, generally, regarded, as, having, privileged, contact, with, the, deity, or, deities, of, the, religion, to, which, they, subscribe, often, interpreting, the, meaning, of, events, and, performing, the, rituals, of, the, religion, there, is, no, common, definition, of, the, duties, of, priesthood, between, faiths, but, generally, it, includes, mediating, the, relationship, between, one, s, congregation, worshippers, and, other, members, of, the, religious, body, and, its, deity, or, deities, and, administering, religious, rituals, and, rites, these, often, include, blessing, worshipers, with, prayers, of, joy, at, marriages, after, a, birth, and, at,

library, or, collection, of, sacred, texts, is, also, commonly, a, responsibility, for, example, the, modern, term, for, clerical, duties, in, a, secular, office, refers, originally, to, the, duties, of, a, cleric, the, question, of, which, religions, have, a, priest, depends, on, how, the, titles, of, leaders, are, used, or, translated, into, english, in, some, cases, leaders, are, more, like, those, that, other, believers, will, often, turn, to, for, advice, on, spiritual, matters, and, less, of, a, person, authorized, to, perform, the, sacred, rituals, for, example, clergy, in, roman, catholicism, and, eastern, orthodoxy, are, priests, as, with, certain, synods, of, lutheranism, and, anglicanism, though, other, branches, of, protestant, christianity, such, as, methodists, and, baptists, use, minister, and, pastor, the, terms, priest, and, priestess, are, sufficiently, generic, that, they, may, be, used, in, an, anthropological, sense, to, describe, the, religious, mediators, of, an, unknown, or, otherwise, unspecified, religion, in, many, religions, being, a, priest, or, priestess, is, a, full, time, position, ruling, out, any, other, career, many, christian, priests, and, pastors, choose, or, are, mandated, to, dedicate, themselves, to, their, churches, and, receive, their, living, directly, from, their, churches, in, other, cases, it, is, a, part, time, role, for, example, in, the, early, history, of, iceland, the, chieftains, were, titled, go, i, a, word, meaning, priest, as, seen, in, the, saga, of, hrafnkell, freysgo, i, however, being, a, priest, consisted, merely, of, offering, periodic, sacrifices, to, the, norse, gods, and, goddesses, it, was, not, a, full, time, role, nor, did, it, involve, ordination, in, some, religions, being, a, priest, or, priestess, is, by, human, election, or, human, choice, in, judaism, the, priesthood, is, inherited, in, familial, lines, in, a, theocracy, a, society, is, governed, by, its, priesthood, the, word, priest, is, ultimately, derived, from, latin, via, greek, presbyter, the, term, for, elder, especially, elders, of, jewish, or, christian, communities, in, late, antiquity, the, latin, presbyter, ultimately, represents, greek, presb, teros, the, regular, latin, word, for, priest, being, sacerdos, corresponding, to, hiere, s, it, is, possible, that, the, latin, word, was, loaned, into, old, english, and, only, from, old, english, reached, other, germanic, languages, via, the, anglo, saxon, mission, to, the, continent, giving, old, icelandic, prestr, old, swedish, pr, ster,

range, of, theological, opinion, its, presbyterate, includes, priests, who, consider, themselves, no, different, in, any, respect, from, those, of, the, roman, catholic, church, and, a, minority, who, prefer, to, use, the, title, presbyter, in, order, to, distance, themselves, from, the, more, sacrificial, theological, implications, which, they, associate, with, the, word, priest, while, priest, is, the, official, title, of, a, member, of, the, presbyterate, in, every, anglican, province, worldwide, retained, by, the, elizabethan, settlement, the, ordination, rite, of, certain, provinces,
