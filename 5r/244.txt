allah, l, l, l, arabic, romanized, all, h, ipa, is, the, common, arabic, word, for, god, in, the, english, language, the, word, generally, refers, to, god, in, islam, the, word, is, thought, to, be, derived, by, contraction, from, al, il, h, which, means, the, god, and, is, linguistically, related, to, the, aramaic, words, elah, and, syriac, al, h, and, the, hebrew, word, el, elohim, for, god, the, word, allah, has, been, used, by, arabic, people, of, different, religions, since, pre, islamic, times, the, pre, islamic, arabs, worshipped, a, supreme, deity, whom, they, called, allah, alongside, other, lesser, deities, muhammad, used, the, word, allah, to, indicate, the, islamic, conception, of, god, allah, has, been, used, as, a, term, for, god, by, muslims, both, arab, and, non, arab, judaeo, arabic, speaking, jews, and, arab, christians, after, the, terms, al, il, h, and, allah, were, used, interchangeably, in, classical, arabic, by, the, majority, of, arabs, who, had, become, muslims, it, is, also, often, albeit, not, exclusively, used, in, this, way, by, b, bists, bah, s, mandaeans, indonesian, and, maltese, christians, and, sephardi, jews, as, well, as, by, the, gagauz, people, similar, usage, by, christians, and, sikhs, in, peninsular, malaysia, has, recently, led, to, political, and, legal, controversies, the, etymology, of, the, word, all, h, has, been, discussed, extensively, by, classical, arab, philologists, most, considered, it, to, be, derived, from, a, contraction, of, the, arabic, definite, article, al, and, il, h, deity, god, to, al, l, h, meaning, the, deity, the, god, indeed, there, is, the, interchangeability, of, al, il, h, and, all, h, in, early, arabic, poetry, even, when, composed, by, the, christian, ad, ibn, zayd, the, majority, of, scholars, accept, this, hypothesis, a, minority, hypothesis, seen, with, more, skepticism, is, that, the, term, is, a, loanword, from, syriac, al, h, grammarians, of, the, basra, school, regarded, it, as, either, formed, spontaneously, murtajal, or, as, the, definite, form, of, l, h, from, the, verbal, root, lyh, with, the, meaning, of, lofty, or, hidden, the, use, of, allah, as, the, name, of, a, deity, appears, as, early, as, the, first, century, an, inscription, using, the, ancient, south, arabian, script, in, old, arabic, from, qaryat, al, f, w, reads, to, kahl, and, lh, and, aththar, b, khl, w, lh, w, r, cognates, of, the, name, all, h, exist, in, other, semitic, languages, including, hebrew, and, aramaic, the, corresponding, aramaic, form, is, el, h, but, its, emphatic, state, is, el, h, it, is, written, as, l, h, in, biblical, aramaic, and, al, h, in, syriac, both, meaning, simply, god, the, unusual, syriac, form, is, likely, an, imitation, of, the, arabic, regional, variants, of, the, word, allah, occur, in, both, pagan, and, christian, pre, islamic, inscriptions, according, to, marshall, hodgson, it, seems, that, in, the, pre, islamic, times, some, arab, christians, made, pilgrimage, to, the, kaaba, a, pagan, temple, at, that, time, honoring, allah, there, as, god, the, creator, the, syriac, word, l, h, can, be, found, in, the, reports, and, the, lists, of, names, of, christian, martyrs, in, south, arabia, as, reported, by, antique, syriac, documents, of, the, names, of, those, martyrs, from, the, era, of, the, himyarite, and, aksumite, kingdoms, in, an, inscription, of, christian, martyrion, dated, back, to, 512, references, to, al, ilah, can, be, found, in, both, arabic, and, aramaic, the, inscription, starts, with, the, statement, by, the, help, of, al, ilah, archaeological, excavation, quests, have, led, to, the, discovery, of, ancient, pre, islamic, inscriptions, and, tombs, made, by, arab, christians, in, the, ruins, of, a, church, at, umm, el, jimal, in, northern, jordan, which, initially, according, to, enno, littman, 1949, contained, references, to, allah, as, the, proper, name, of, god, however, on, a, second, revision, by, bellamy, et, al, 1985, 1988, the, five, verse, inscription, was, retranslated, 1, this, was, set, up, by, colleagues, of, ulayh, 2, son, of, ubaydah, secretary, 3, of, the, cohort, augusta, secunda, 4, philadelphiana, may, he, go, mad, who, 5, effaces, it, irfan, shah, d, quoting, the, 10th, century, encyclopedic, collection, kitab, al, aghani, notes, that, pre, islamic, arab, christians, have, been, reported, to, have, raised, the, battle, cry, ya, la, ibad, allah, o, slaves, of, allah, to, invoke, each, other, into, battle, according, to, shahid, on, the, authority, of, 10th, century, muslim, scholar, al, marzubani, allah, was, also, mentioned, in, pre, islamic, christian, poems, by, some, ghassanid, and, tanukhid, poets, in, syria, and, northern, arabia, different, theories, have, been, proposed, regarding, the, role, of, allah, in, pre, islamic, polytheistic, cults, according, to, the, quran, exegete, ibn, kathir, arab, pagans, considered, allah, as, an, unseen, god, who, created, and, controlled, the, universe, pagans, believed, worship, of, humans, or, animals, who, had, lucky, events, in, their, life, brought, them, closer, to, god, pre, islamic, meccans, worshiped, allah, alongside, a, host, of, lesser, gods, and, those, whom, they, called, the, daughters, of, allah, islam, forbade, worship, of, anyone, or, anything, other, than, god, some, authors, have, suggested, that, polytheistic, arabs, used, the, name, as, a, reference, to, a, creator, god, or, a, supreme, deity, of, their, pantheon, the, term, may, have, been, vague, in, the, meccan, religion, according, to, one, hypothesis, which, goes, back, to, julius, wellhausen, allah, the, supreme, deity, of, the, tribal, federation, around, quraysh, was, a, designation, that, consecrated, the, superiority, of, hubal, the, supreme, deity, of, quraysh, over, the, other, gods, however, there, is, also, evidence, that, allah, and, hubal, were, two, distinct, deities, according, to, that, hypothesis, the, kaaba, was, first, consecrated, to, a, supreme, deity, named, allah, and, then, hosted, the, pantheon, of, quraysh, after, their, conquest, of, mecca, about, a, century, before, the, time, of, muhammad, some, inscriptions, seem, to, indicate, the, use, of, allah, as, a, name, of, a, polytheist, deity, centuries, earlier, but, nothing, precise, is, known, about, this, use, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, allah, may, have, represented, a, remote, creator, god, who, was, gradually, eclipsed, by, more, particularized, local, deities, there, is, disagreement, on, whether, allah, played, a, major, role, in, the, meccan, religious, cult, no, iconic, representation, of, allah, is, known, to, have, existed, muhammad, s, father, s, name, was, abd, all, h, meaning, the, slave, of, all, h, the, interpretation, that, pre, islamic, arabs, once, practiced, abrahamic, religions, is, supported, by, some, literary, evidence, being, the, prevalence, of, ishmael, whose, god, was, that, of, abraham, in, pre, islamic, arab, culture, in, contrast, with, pre, islamic, arabian, polytheism, as, stated, by, gerhard, b, wering, god, in, islam, does, not, have, associates, and, companions, nor, is, there, any, kinship, between, god, and, jinn, pre, islamic, pagan, arabs, believed, in, a, blind, powerful, inexorable, and, insensible, fate, over, which, man, had, no, control, this, was, replaced, with, the, islamic, notion, of, a, powerful, but, provident, and, merciful, god, according, to, francis, edward, peters, the, qur, n, insists, muslims, believe, and, historians, affirm, that, muhammad, and, his, followers, worship, the, same, god, as, the, jews, 29, 46, the, qur, an, s, allah, is, the, same, creator, god, who, covenanted, with, abraham, peters, states, that, the, qur, an, portrays, allah, as, both, more, powerful, and, more, remote, than, yahweh, and, as, a, universal, deity, unlike, yahweh, who, closely, follows, israelites, since, the, first, centuries, of, islam, arabic, speaking, commentators, of, jewish, christian, and, islamic, faith, used, the, term, allah, as, a, generic, term, for, the, supreme, being, saadia, gaon, used, the, term, allah, interchangeably, with, the, term, l, h, m, theodore, abu, qurrah, translates, theos, as, allah, in, his, bible, as, in, john, 1, 1, the, word, was, with, allah, muslim, commentators, likewise, used, the, term, allah, for, the, biblical, concept, of, god, ibn, qutayba, writes, you, cannot, serve, both, allah, and, mammon, however, muslim, translators, of, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, asia, rarely, translated, the, tetragrammaton, referring, to, the, supreme, being, in, israelite, tradition, as, allah, instead, most, commentators, either, translated, yahweh, as, either, yahwah, or, rabb, the, latter, corresponding, to, the, jewish, custom, to, refer, to, yahweh, as, adonai, most, quran, commentators, including, al, tabari, d, 923, al, zamakhshari, d, 1143, 44, and, al, razi, d, 1209, regard, allah, to, be, a, proper, name, while, other, names, of, god, in, islam, denote, attributes, or, adjectives, the, term, allah, specifically, refers, to, his, essence, as, his, real, name, ism, alam, li, dhatih, the, other, names, are, known, as, the, 99, names, of, allah, al, asm, al, usn, lit, meaning, the, best, names, or, the, most, beautiful, names, and, considered, attributes, each, of, which, evoke, a, distinct, characteristic, of, allah, all, these, names, refer, to, allah, the, supreme, and, all, comprehensive, divine, name, among, the, 99, names, of, god, the, most, famous, and, most, frequent, of, these, names, are, the, merciful, ar, ra, m, n, and, the, compassionate, ar, ra, m, including, the, forementioned, above, al, a, ad, the, one, the, indivisible, and, al, w, id, the, unique, the, single, according, to, islamic, belief, allah, is, the, most, common, word, to, represent, god, and, humble, submission, to, his, will, divine, ordinances, and, commandments, is, the, pivot, of, the, muslim, faith, he, is, the, only, god, creator, of, the, universe, and, the, judge, of, humankind, he, is, unique, w, id, and, inherently, one, a, ad, all, merciful, and, omnipotent, no, human, eyes, can, see, allah, till, the, day, of, judgement, the, qur, an, declares, the, reality, of, allah, his, inaccessible, mystery, his, various, names, and, his, actions, on, behalf, of, his, creatures, allah, does, not, depend, on, anything, allah, is, not, considered, a, part, of, the, christian, trinity, god, has, no, parents, and, no, children, the, concept, correlates, to, the, tawhid, where, chapter, 112, of, the, qur, an, al, ikhl, s, the, sincerity, reads, in, a, sufi, practice, known, as, dhikr, allah, arabic, lit, remembrance, of, god, the, sufi, repeats, and, contemplates, the, name, allah, or, other, associated, divine, names, to, him, while, controlling, his, or, her, breath, the, islamic, tradition, to, use, allah, as, the, personal, name, of, god, became, disputed, in, contemporary, scholarship, including, the, question, whether, or, not, the, word, allah, should, be, translated, as, god, umar, faruq, abd, allah, urged, english, speaking, muslims, to, use, god, instead, of, allah, for, the, sake, of, finding, extensive, middle, ground, we, share, with, other, abrahamic, and, universal, traditions, most, muslims, use, the, arabic, phrase, in, sh, a, ll, h, meaning, if, god, wills, unstranslated, after, references, to, future, events, muslim, discursive, piety, encourages, beginning, things, with, the, invocation, of, bi, smi, ll, h, meaning, in, the, name, of, god, there, are, certain, other, phrases, in, praise, of, god, that, are, favored, by, muslims, and, left, untransalted, including, sub, na, ll, h, glory, be, to, god, al, amdu, li, ll, h, praise, be, to, god, l, il, ha, ill, ll, h, there, is, no, deity, but, god, or, sometimes, l, il, ha, ill, inta, huwa, there, is, no, deity, but, you, him, and, all, hu, akbar, god, is, the, most, great, as, a, devotional, exercise, of, remembering, god, dhikr, the, christian, arabs, of, today, have, no, other, word, for, god, than, allah, similarly, the, aramaic, word, for, god, in, the, language, of, assyrian, christians, is, l, h, or, alaha, even, the, arabic, descended, maltese, language, of, malta, whose, population, is, almost, entirely, catholic, uses, alla, for, god, arab, christians, have, used, two, forms, of, invocations, that, were, affixed, to, the, beginning, of, their, written, works, they, adopted, the, muslim, bismill, h, and, also, created, their, own, trinitized, bismill, h, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, the, muslim, bismill, h, reads, in, the, name, of, god, the, compassionate, the, merciful, the, trinitized, bismill, h, reads, in, the, name, of, father, and, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, one, god, the, syriac, latin, and, greek, invocations, do, not, have, the, words, one, god, at, the, end, this, addition, was, made, to, emphasize, the, monotheistic, aspect, of, trinitarian, belief, and, also, to, make, it, more, palatable, to, muslims, the, word, all, h, is, generally, pronounced, exhibiting, a, heavy, l, m, a, velarized, alveolar, lateral, approximant, a, marginal, phoneme, in, modern, standard, arabic, since, the, initial, alef, has, no, hamza, the, initial, is, elided, when, a, preceding, word, ends, in, a, vowel, if, the, preceding, vowel, is, i, the, l, m, is, light, as, in, for, instance, the, basmala, the, history, of, the, name, all, h, in, english, was, probably, influenced, by, the, study, of, comparative, religion, in, the, 19th, century, for, example, thomas, carlyle, 1840, sometimes, used, the, term, allah, but, without, any, implication, that, allah, was, anything, different, from, god, however, in, his, biography, of, mu, ammad, 1934, tor, andr, always, used, the, term, allah, though, he, allows, that, this, conception, of, god, seems, to, imply, that, it, is, different, from, that, of, the, jewish, and, christian, theologies, languages, which, may, not, commonly, use, the, term, allah, to, denote, god, may, still, contain, popular, expressions, which, use, the, word, for, example, because, of, the, centuries, long, muslim, presence, in, the, iberian, peninsula, the, word, ojal, in, the, spanish, language, and, oxal, in, the, portuguese, language, exist, today, borrowed, from, andalusi, arabic, law, ll, h, similar, to, inshalla, arabic, this, phrase, literally, means, if, god, wills, in, the, sense, of, i, hope, so, the, german, poet, mahlmann, used, the, form, allah, as, the, title, of, a, poem, about, the, ultimate, deity, though, it, is, unclear, how, much, islamic, thought, he, intended, to, convey, some, muslims, leave, the, name, all, h, untranslated, in, english, rather, than, using, the, english, translation, god, the, word, has, also, been, applied, to, certain, living, human, beings, as, personifications, of, the, term, and, concept, christians, in, malaysia, and, indonesia, use, allah, to, refer, to, god, in, the, malaysian, and, indonesian, languages, both, of, them, standardized, forms, of, the, malay, language, mainstream, bible, translations, in, the, language, use, allah, as, the, translation, of, hebrew, elohim, translated, in, english, bibles, as, god, this, goes, back, to, early, translation, work, by, francis, xavier, in, the, 16th, century, the, first, dictionary, of, dutch, malay, by, albert, cornelius, ruyl, justus, heurnius, and, caspar, wiltens, in, 1650, revised, edition, from, 1623, edition, and, 1631, latin, edition, recorded, allah, as, the, translation, of, the, dutch, word, godt, ruyl, also, translated, the, gospel, of, matthew, in, 1612, into, the, malay, language, an, early, bible, translation, into, a, non, european, language, made, a, year, after, the, publication, of, the, king, james, version, which, was, printed, in, the, netherlands, in, 1629, then, he, translated, the, gospel, of, mark, published, in, 1638, the, government, of, malaysia, in, 2007, outlawed, usage, of, the, term, allah, in, any, other, but, muslim, contexts, but, the, malayan, high, court, in, 2009, revoked, the, law, ruling, it, unconstitutional, while, allah, had, been, used, for, the, christian, god, in, malay, for, more, than, four, centuries, the, contemporary, controversy, was, triggered, by, usage, of, allah, by, the, roman, catholic, newspaper, the, herald, the, government, appealed, the, court, ruling, and, the, high, court, suspended, implementation, of, its, verdict, until, the, hearing, of, the, appeal, in, october, 2013, the, court, ruled, in, favor, of, the, government, s, ban, in, early, 2014, the, malaysian, government, confiscated, more, than, 300, bibles, for, using, the, word, to, refer, to, the, christian, god, in, peninsular, malaysia, however, the, use, of, allah, is, not, prohibited, in, the, two, malaysian, states, of, sabah, and, sarawak, the, main, reason, it, is, not, prohibited, in, these, two, states, is, that, usage, has, been, long, established, and, local, alkitab, bibles, have, been, widely, distributed, freely, in, east, malaysia, without, restrictions, for, years, both, states, also, do, not, have, similar, islamic, state, laws, as, those, in, west, malaysia, in, reaction, to, some, media, criticism, the, malaysian, government, has, introduced, a, 10, point, solution, to, avoid, confusion, and, misleading, information, the, 10, point, solution, is, in, line, with, the, spirit, of, the, 18, and, 20, point, agreements, of, sarawak, and, sabah, the, word, all, h, is, always, written, without, an, alif, to, spell, the, vowel, this, is, because, the, spelling, was, settled, before, arabic, spelling, started, habitually, using, alif, to, spell, however, in, vocalized, spelling, a, small, diacritic, alif, is, added, on, top, of, the, shaddah, to, indicate, the, pronunciation, in, the, pre, islamic, zabad, inscription, god, is, referred, to, by, the, term, that, is, alif, lam, alif, lam, ha, this, presumably, indicates, al, il, h, the, god, without, alif, for, many, arabic, type, fonts, feature, special, ligatures, for, allah, since, arabic, script, is, used, to, write, other, texts, rather, than, koran, only, rendering, l, m, l, m, h, as, the, previous, ligature, is, considered, faulty, which, is, the, case, with, most, common, arabic, typefaces, this, simplified, style, is, often, preferred, for, clarity, especially, in, non, arabic, languages, but, may, not, be, considered, appropriate, in, situations, where, a, more, elaborate, style, of, calligraphy, is, preferred, unicode, has, a, code, point, reserved, for, all, h, u, fdf2, in, the, arabic, presentation, forms, a, block, which, exists, solely, for, compatibility, with, some, older, legacy, character, sets, that, encoded, presentation, forms, directly, this, is, discouraged, for, new, text, instead, the, word, all, h, should, be, represented, by, its, individual, arabic, letters, while, modern, font, technologies, will, render, the, desired, ligature, the, calligraphic, variant, of, the, word, used, as, the, emblem, of, iran, is, encoded, in, unicode, in, the, miscellaneous, symbols, range, at, code, point, u, 262b, the, flags, that, include, the, word, are, also, present, in, the, regional, indicator, symbols, of, unicode
