mah, y, na, m, h, j, n, mah, h, yah, n, sanskrit, pronounced, lit, great, vehicle, is, a, term, for, a, broad, group, of, buddhist, traditions, texts, philosophies, and, practices, developed, in, ancient, india, c, 1st, century, bce, onwards, it, is, considered, one, of, the, three, main, existing, branches, of, buddhism, the, others, being, therav, da, and, vajray, na, mah, y, na, accepts, the, main, scriptures, and, teachings, of, early, buddhism, but, also, recognizes, various, doctrines, and, texts, that, are, not, accepted, by, theravada, buddhism, as, original, these, include, the, mah, y, na, s, tras, and, their, emphasis, on, the, bodhisattva, path, and, praj, p, ramit, vajray, na, or, mantra, traditions, are, a, subset, of, mah, y, na, which, makes, use, of, numerous, tantric, methods, vajray, nists, consider, to, help, achieve, buddhahood, mah, y, na, also, refers, to, the, path, of, the, bodhisattva, striving, to, become, a, fully, awakened, buddha, for, the, benefit, of, all, sentient, beings, and, is, thus, also, called, the, bodhisattva, vehicle, bodhisattvay, na, mah, y, na, buddhism, generally, sees, the, goal, of, becoming, a, buddha, through, the, bodhisattva, path, as, being, available, to, all, and, sees, the, state, of, the, arhat, as, incomplete, mah, y, na, also, includes, numerous, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, that, are, not, found, in, theravada, such, as, amit, bha, and, vairocana, mah, y, na, buddhist, philosophy, also, promotes, unique, theories, such, as, the, madhyamaka, theory, of, emptiness, nyat, the, vij, nav, da, the, doctrine, of, consciousness, also, called, mind, only, and, the, buddha, nature, teaching, while, initially, a, small, movement, in, india, mah, y, na, eventually, grew, to, become, an, influential, force, in, indian, buddhism, large, scholastic, centers, associated, with, mah, y, na, such, as, nalanda, and, vikramashila, thrived, between, the, 7th, and, 12th, centuries, in, the, course, of, its, history, mah, y, na, buddhism, spread, from, south, asia, to, east, asia, southeast, asia, and, the, himalayan, regions, various, mah, y, na, traditions, are, the, predominant, forms, of, buddhism, found, in, china, korea, japan, taiwan, singapore, vietnam, philippines, indonesia, and, malaysia, since, vajray, na, is, a, tantric, form, of, mah, y, na, mah, y, na, buddhism, is, also, dominant, in, tibet, mongolia, bhutan, and, other, himalayan, regions, it, has, also, been, traditionally, present, elsewhere, in, asia, as, a, minority, among, buddhist, communities, in, nepal, malaysia, indonesia, and, regions, with, asian, diaspora, communities, as, of, 2010, the, mah, y, na, tradition, was, the, largest, major, tradition, of, buddhism, with, 53, of, buddhists, belonging, to, east, asian, mah, y, na, and, 6, to, vajray, na, compared, to, 36, to, theravada, according, to, jan, nattier, the, term, mah, y, na, great, vehicle, was, originally, an, honorary, synonym, for, bodhisattvay, na, bodhisattva, vehicle, the, vehicle, of, a, bodhisattva, seeking, buddhahood, for, the, benefit, of, all, sentient, beings, the, term, mah, y, na, which, had, earlier, been, used, simply, as, an, epithet, for, buddhism, itself, was, therefore, adopted, at, an, early, date, as, a, synonym, for, the, path, and, the, teachings, of, the, bodhisattvas, since, it, was, simply, an, honorary, term, for, bodhisattvay, na, the, adoption, of, the, term, mah, y, na, and, its, application, to, bodhisattvay, na, did, not, represent, a, significant, turning, point, in, the, development, of, a, mah, y, na, tradition, the, earliest, mah, y, na, texts, such, as, the, lotus, s, tra, often, use, the, term, mah, y, na, as, a, synonym, for, bodhisattvay, na, but, the, term, h, nay, na, is, comparatively, rare, in, the, earliest, sources, the, presumed, dichotomy, between, mah, y, na, and, h, nay, na, can, be, deceptive, as, the, two, terms, were, not, actually, formed, in, relation, to, one, another, in, the, same, era, among, the, earliest, and, most, important, references, to, mah, y, na, are, those, that, occur, in, the, lotus, s, tra, skt, saddharma, pu, ar, ka, s, tra, dating, between, the, 1st, century, bce, and, the, 1st, century, ce, seishi, karashima, has, suggested, that, the, term, first, used, in, an, earlier, gandh, ri, prakrit, version, of, the, lotus, s, tra, was, not, the, term, mah, y, na, but, the, prakrit, word, mah, j, na, in, the, sense, of, mah, j, na, great, knowing, at, a, later, stage, when, the, early, prakrit, word, was, converted, into, sanskrit, this, mah, j, na, being, phonetically, ambivalent, may, have, been, converted, into, mah, y, na, possibly, because, of, what, may, have, been, a, double, meaning, in, the, famous, parable, of, the, burning, house, which, talks, of, three, vehicles, or, carts, skt, y, na, in, chinese, mah, y, na, is, called, d, sh, ng, or, d, ch, ng, which, is, a, calque, of, maha, great, yana, vehicle, there, is, also, the, transliteration, the, term, appeared, in, some, of, the, earliest, mah, y, na, texts, including, emperor, ling, of, han, s, translation, of, the, lotus, sutra, it, also, appears, in, the, chinese, gamas, though, scholars, like, yin, shun, argue, that, this, is, a, later, addition, some, chinese, scholars, also, argue, that, the, meaning, of, the, term, in, these, earlier, texts, is, different, from, later, ideas, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, the, origins, of, mah, y, na, are, still, not, completely, understood, and, there, are, numerous, competing, theories, the, earliest, western, views, of, mah, y, na, assumed, that, it, existed, as, a, separate, school, in, competition, with, the, so, called, h, nay, na, schools, some, of, the, major, theories, about, the, origins, of, mah, y, na, include, the, following, the, lay, origins, theory, was, first, proposed, by, jean, przyluski, and, then, defended, by, tienne, lamotte, and, akira, hirakawa, this, view, states, that, laypersons, were, particularly, important, in, the, development, of, mah, y, na, and, is, partly, based, on, some, texts, like, the, vimalakirti, s, tra, which, praise, lay, figures, at, the, expense, of, monastics, this, theory, is, no, longer, widely, accepted, since, numerous, early, mah, y, na, works, promote, monasticism, and, asceticism, the, mah, s, ghika, origin, theory, which, argues, that, mah, y, na, developed, within, the, mah, s, ghika, tradition, this, is, defended, by, scholars, such, as, hendrik, kern, a, k, warder, and, paul, williams, who, argue, that, at, least, some, mah, y, na, elements, developed, among, mah, s, ghika, communities, from, the, 1st, century, bce, onwards, possibly, in, the, area, along, the, k, a, river, in, the, ndhra, region, of, southern, india, the, mah, s, ghika, doctrine, of, the, supramundane, lokottara, nature, of, the, buddha, is, sometimes, seen, as, a, precursor, to, mah, y, na, views, of, the, buddha, some, scholars, also, see, mah, y, na, figures, like, n, g, rjuna, dignaga, candrak, rti, ryadeva, and, bhavaviveka, as, having, ties, to, the, mah, s, ghika, tradition, of, ndhra, however, other, scholars, have, also, pointed, to, different, regions, as, being, important, such, as, gandhara, and, northwest, india, the, mah, s, ghika, origins, theory, has, also, slowly, been, shown, to, be, problematic, by, scholarship, that, revealed, how, certain, mah, y, na, sutras, show, traces, of, having, developed, among, other, nik, yas, or, monastic, orders, such, as, the, dharmaguptaka, because, of, such, evidence, scholars, like, paul, harrison, and, paul, williams, argue, that, the, movement, was, not, sectarian, and, was, possibly, pan, buddhist, there, is, no, evidence, that, mah, y, na, ever, referred, to, a, separate, formal, school, or, sect, of, buddhism, but, rather, that, it, existed, as, a, certain, set, of, ideals, and, later, doctrines, for, aspiring, bodhisattvas, the, forest, hypothesis, meanwhile, states, that, mah, y, na, arose, mainly, among, hard, core, ascetics, members, of, the, forest, dwelling, aranyavasin, wing, of, the, buddhist, order, who, were, attempting, to, imitate, the, buddha, s, forest, living, this, has, been, defended, by, paul, harrison, jan, nattier, and, reginald, ray, this, theory, is, based, on, certain, sutras, like, the, ugraparip, cch, s, tra, and, the, mah, y, na, r, rap, lapa, iprcch, which, promote, ascetic, practice, in, the, wilderness, as, a, superior, and, elite, path, these, texts, criticize, monks, who, live, in, cities, and, denigrate, the, forest, life, jan, nattier, s, study, of, the, ugraparip, cch, s, tra, a, few, good, men, 2003, argues, that, this, sutra, represents, the, earliest, form, of, mah, y, na, which, presents, the, bodhisattva, path, as, a, supremely, difficult, enterprise, of, elite, monastic, forest, asceticism, boucher, s, study, on, the, r, rap, laparip, cch, s, tra, 2008, is, another, recent, work, on, this, subject, the, cult, of, the, book, theory, defended, by, gregory, schopen, states, that, mah, y, na, arose, among, a, number, of, loosely, connected, book, worshiping, groups, of, monastics, who, studied, memorized, copied, and, revered, particular, mah, y, na, s, tras, schopen, thinks, they, were, inspired, by, cult, shrines, where, mah, y, na, sutras, were, kept, schopen, also, argued, that, these, groups, mostly, rejected, stupa, worship, or, worshiping, holy, relics, david, drewes, has, recently, argued, against, all, of, the, major, theories, outlined, above, he, points, out, that, there, is, no, actual, evidence, for, the, existence, of, book, shrines, that, the, practice, of, sutra, veneration, was, pan, buddhist, and, not, distinctly, mah, y, na, furthermore, drewes, argues, that, mah, y, na, sutras, advocate, mnemic, oral, aural, practices, more, frequently, than, they, do, written, ones, regarding, the, forest, hypothesis, he, points, out, that, only, a, few, mah, y, na, sutras, directly, advocate, forest, dwelling, while, the, others, either, do, not, mention, it, or, see, it, as, unhelpful, promoting, easier, practices, such, as, merely, listening, to, the, sutra, or, thinking, of, particular, buddhas, that, they, claim, can, enable, one, to, be, reborn, in, special, luxurious, pure, lands, where, one, will, be, able, to, make, easy, and, rapid, progress, on, the, bodhisattva, path, and, attain, buddhahood, after, as, little, as, one, lifetime, drewes, states, that, the, evidence, merely, shows, that, mah, y, na, was, primarily, a, textual, movement, focused, on, the, revelation, preaching, and, dissemination, of, mah, y, na, sutras, that, developed, within, and, never, really, departed, from, traditional, buddhist, social, and, institutional, structures, drewes, points, out, the, importance, of, dharmabhanakas, preachers, reciters, of, these, sutras, in, the, early, mah, y, na, sutras, this, figure, is, widely, praised, as, someone, who, should, be, respected, obeyed, as, a, slave, serves, his, lord, and, donated, to, and, it, is, thus, possible, these, people, were, the, primary, agents, of, the, mah, y, na, movement, early, mahayana, came, directly, from, early, buddhist, schools, and, was, a, successor, to, them, the, earliest, textual, evidence, of, mah, y, na, comes, from, s, tras, discourses, scriptures, originating, around, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, jan, nattier, has, noted, that, some, of, the, earliest, mah, y, na, texts, such, as, the, ugraparip, ccha, s, tra, use, the, term, mah, y, na, yet, there, is, no, doctrinal, difference, between, mah, y, na, in, this, context, and, the, early, schools, instead, nattier, writes, that, in, the, earliest, sources, mah, y, na, referred, to, the, rigorous, emulation, of, gautama, buddha, s, path, to, buddhahood, some, important, evidence, for, early, mah, y, na, buddhism, comes, from, the, texts, translated, by, the, indoscythian, monk, lokak, ema, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, who, came, to, china, from, the, kingdom, of, gandh, ra, these, are, some, of, the, earliest, known, mah, y, na, texts, study, of, these, texts, by, paul, harrison, and, others, show, that, they, strongly, promote, monasticism, contra, the, lay, origin, theory, acknowledge, the, legitimacy, of, arhatship, and, do, not, show, any, attempt, to, establish, a, new, sect, or, order, a, few, of, these, texts, often, emphasize, ascetic, practices, forest, dwelling, and, deep, states, of, meditative, concentration, samadhi, indian, mah, y, na, never, had, nor, ever, attempted, to, have, a, separate, vinaya, or, ordination, lineage, from, the, early, schools, of, buddhism, and, therefore, each, bhik, u, or, bhik, u, adhering, to, the, mah, y, na, formally, belonged, to, one, of, the, early, buddhist, schools, membership, in, these, nik, yas, or, monastic, orders, continues, today, with, the, dharmaguptaka, nik, ya, being, used, in, east, asia, and, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, nik, ya, being, used, in, tibetan, buddhism, therefore, mah, y, na, was, never, a, separate, monastic, sect, outside, of, the, early, schools, paul, harrison, clarifies, that, while, monastic, mah, y, nists, belonged, to, a, nik, ya, not, all, members, of, a, nik, ya, were, mah, y, nists, from, chinese, monks, visiting, india, we, now, know, that, both, mah, y, na, and, non, mah, y, na, monks, in, india, often, lived, in, the, same, monasteries, side, by, side, it, is, also, possible, that, formally, mah, y, na, would, have, been, understood, as, a, group, of, monks, or, nuns, within, a, larger, monastery, taking, a, vow, together, known, as, a, kriy, karma, to, memorize, and, study, a, mah, y, na, text, or, texts, the, earliest, stone, inscription, containing, a, recognizably, mah, y, na, formulation, and, a, mention, of, the, buddha, amit, bha, an, important, mah, y, na, figure, was, found, in, the, indian, subcontinent, in, mathura, and, dated, to, around, 180, ce, remains, of, a, statue, of, a, buddha, bear, the, br, hm, inscription, made, in, the, year, 28, of, the, reign, of, king, huvi, ka, for, the, blessed, one, the, buddha, amit, bha, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, the, kushan, emperor, huvi, ka, himself, was, a, follower, of, mah, y, na, a, sanskrit, manuscript, fragment, in, the, sch, yen, collection, describes, huvi, ka, as, having, set, forth, in, the, mah, y, na, evidence, of, the, name, mah, y, na, in, indian, inscriptions, in, the, period, before, the, 5th, century, is, very, limited, in, comparison, to, the, multiplicity, of, mah, y, na, writings, transmitted, from, central, asia, to, china, at, that, time, based, on, archeological, evidence, gregory, schopen, argues, that, indian, mah, y, na, remained, an, extremely, limited, minority, movement, if, it, remained, at, all, that, attracted, absolutely, no, documented, public, or, popular, support, for, at, least, two, more, centuries, likewise, joseph, walser, speaks, of, mah, y, na, s, virtual, invisibility, in, the, archaeological, record, until, the, fifth, century, schopen, also, sees, this, movement, as, being, in, tension, with, other, buddhists, struggling, for, recognition, and, acceptance, their, embattled, mentality, may, have, led, to, certain, elements, found, in, mah, y, na, texts, like, lotus, sutra, such, as, a, concern, with, preserving, texts, schopen, harrison, and, nattier, also, argue, that, these, communities, were, probably, not, a, single, unified, movement, but, scattered, groups, based, on, different, practices, and, sutras, one, reason, for, this, view, is, that, mah, y, na, sources, are, extremely, diverse, advocating, many, different, often, conflicting, doctrines, and, positions, as, jan, nattier, writes, thus, we, find, one, scripture, the, aksobhya, vyuha, that, advocates, both, sr, vaka, and, bodhisattva, practices, propounds, the, possibility, of, rebirth, in, a, pure, land, and, enthusiastically, recommends, the, cult, of, the, book, yet, seems, to, know, nothing, of, emptiness, theory, the, ten, bhumis, or, the, trikaya, while, another, the, p, u, sa, pen, yeh, ching, propounds, the, ten, bhumis, and, focuses, exclusively, on, the, path, of, the, bodhisattva, but, never, discusses, the, paramitas, a, madhyamika, treatise, nagarjuna, s, mulamadhyamika, karikas, may, enthusiastically, deploy, the, rhetoric, of, emptiness, without, ever, mentioning, the, bodhisattva, path, while, a, yogacara, treatise, vasubandhu, s, madhyanta, vibhaga, bhasya, may, delve, into, the, particulars, of, the, trikaya, doctrine, while, eschewing, the, doctrine, of, ekayana, we, must, be, prepared, in, other, words, to, encounter, a, multiplicity, of, mahayanas, flourishing, even, in, india, not, to, mention, those, that, developed, in, east, asia, and, tibet, in, spite, of, being, a, minority, in, india, indian, mah, y, na, was, an, intellectually, vibrant, movement, which, developed, various, schools, of, thought, during, what, jan, westerhoff, has, been, called, the, golden, age, of, indian, buddhist, philosophy, from, the, beginning, of, the, first, millennium, ce, up, to, the, 7th, century, some, major, mah, y, na, traditions, are, praj, p, ramit, m, dhyamaka, yog, c, ra, buddha, nature, tath, gatagarbha, and, the, school, of, dignaga, and, dharmakirti, as, the, last, and, most, recent, major, early, figures, include, nagarjuna, ryadeva, a, vagho, a, asanga, vasubandhu, and, dignaga, mah, y, na, buddhists, seem, to, have, been, active, in, the, kushan, empire, 30, 375, ce, a, period, that, saw, great, missionary, and, literary, activities, by, buddhists, this, is, supported, by, the, works, of, the, historian, taranatha, the, mah, y, na, movement, or, movements, remained, quite, small, until, it, experienced, much, growth, in, the, fifth, century, very, few, manuscripts, have, been, found, before, the, fifth, century, the, exceptions, are, from, bamiyan, according, to, walser, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, appear, to, have, been, a, watershed, for, the, production, of, mah, y, na, manuscripts, likewise, it, is, only, in, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, ce, that, epigraphic, evidence, shows, some, kind, of, popular, support, for, mah, y, na, including, some, possible, royal, support, at, the, kingdom, of, shan, shan, as, well, as, in, bamiyan, and, mathura, still, even, after, the, 5th, century, the, epigraphic, evidence, which, uses, the, term, mah, y, na, is, still, quite, small, and, is, notably, mainly, monastic, not, lay, by, this, time, chinese, pilgrims, such, as, faxian, 337, 422, ce, xuanzang, 602, 664, yijing, 635, 713, ce, were, traveling, to, india, and, their, writings, do, describe, monasteries, which, they, label, mah, y, na, as, well, as, monasteries, where, both, mah, y, na, monks, and, non, mah, y, na, monks, lived, together, after, the, fifth, century, mah, y, na, buddhism, and, its, institutions, slowly, grew, in, influence, some, of, the, most, influential, institutions, became, massive, monastic, university, complexes, such, as, nalanda, established, by, the, 5th, century, ce, gupta, emperor, kumaragupta, i, and, vikramashila, established, under, dharmapala, c, 783, to, 820, which, were, centers, of, various, branches, of, scholarship, including, mah, y, na, philosophy, the, nalanda, complex, eventually, became, the, largest, and, most, influential, buddhist, center, in, india, for, centuries, even, so, as, noted, by, paul, williams, it, seems, that, fewer, than, 50, percent, of, the, monks, encountered, by, xuanzang, hs, an, tsang, c, 600, 664, on, his, visit, to, india, actually, were, mah, y, nists, over, time, indian, mah, y, na, texts, and, philosophy, reached, central, asia, and, china, through, trade, routes, like, the, silk, road, later, spreading, throughout, east, asia, over, time, central, asian, buddhism, became, heavily, influenced, by, mah, y, na, and, it, was, a, major, source, for, chinese, buddhism, mah, y, na, works, have, also, been, found, in, gandh, ra, indicating, the, importance, of, this, region, for, the, spread, of, mah, y, na, central, asian, mah, y, na, scholars, were, very, important, in, the, silk, road, transmission, of, buddhism, they, include, translators, like, lokak, ema, c, 167, 186, dharmarak, a, c, 265, 313, kum, raj, va, c, 401, and, dharmak, ema, 385, 433, the, site, of, dunhuang, seems, to, have, been, a, particularly, important, place, for, the, study, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, mah, y, na, spread, from, china, to, korea, vietnam, and, taiwan, which, along, with, korea, would, later, spread, it, to, japan, mah, y, na, also, spread, from, india, to, myanmar, and, then, sumatra, and, malaysia, mah, y, na, spread, from, sumatra, to, other, indonesian, islands, including, java, and, borneo, the, philippines, cambodia, and, eventually, indonesian, mah, y, na, traditions, made, it, to, china, by, the, fourth, century, chinese, monks, like, faxian, c, 337, 422, ce, had, also, begun, to, travel, to, india, now, dominated, by, the, guptas, to, bring, back, buddhist, teachings, especially, mah, y, na, works, these, figures, also, wrote, about, their, experiences, in, india, and, their, work, remains, invaluable, for, understanding, indian, buddhism, in, some, cases, indian, mah, y, na, traditions, were, directly, transplanted, as, with, the, case, of, the, east, asian, madhymaka, by, kum, raj, va, and, east, asian, yogacara, especially, by, xuanzang, later, new, developments, in, chinese, mah, y, na, led, to, new, chinese, buddhist, traditions, like, tiantai, huayen, pure, land, and, chan, buddhism, zen, these, traditions, would, then, spread, to, korea, vietnam, and, japan, forms, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, which, are, mainly, based, on, the, doctrines, of, indian, mah, y, na, sutras, are, still, popular, in, east, asian, buddhism, which, is, mostly, dominated, by, various, branches, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, paul, williams, has, noted, that, in, this, tradition, in, the, far, east, primacy, has, always, been, given, to, the, study, of, the, mah, y, na, s, tras, beginning, during, the, gupta, c, 3rd, century, ce, 575, ce, period, a, new, movement, began, to, develop, which, drew, on, previous, mah, y, na, doctrine, as, well, as, new, pan, indian, tantric, ideas, this, came, to, be, known, by, various, names, such, as, vajray, na, tibetan, rdo, rje, theg, pa, mantray, na, and, esoteric, buddhism, or, secret, mantra, guhyamantra, this, new, movement, continued, into, the, pala, era, 8th, century, 12th, century, ce, during, which, it, grew, to, dominate, indian, buddhism, possibly, led, by, groups, of, wandering, tantric, yogis, named, mahasiddhas, this, movement, developed, new, tantric, spiritual, practices, and, also, promoted, new, texts, called, the, buddhist, tantras, philosophically, vajray, na, buddhist, thought, remained, grounded, in, the, mah, y, na, buddhist, ideas, of, madhyamaka, yogacara, and, buddha, nature, tantric, buddhism, generally, deals, with, new, forms, of, meditation, and, ritual, which, often, makes, use, of, the, visualization, of, buddhist, deities, including, buddhas, bodhisattvas, dakinis, and, fierce, deities, and, the, use, of, mantras, most, of, these, practices, are, esoteric, and, require, ritual, initiation, or, introduction, by, a, tantric, master, vajracarya, or, guru, the, source, and, early, origins, of, vajray, na, remain, a, subject, of, debate, among, scholars, some, scholars, like, alexis, sanderson, argue, that, vajray, na, derives, its, tantric, content, from, shaivism, and, that, it, developed, as, a, result, of, royal, courts, sponsoring, both, buddhism, and, saivism, sanderson, argues, that, vajray, na, works, like, the, samvara, and, guhyasamaja, texts, show, direct, borrowing, from, shaiva, tantric, literature, however, other, scholars, such, as, ronald, m, davidson, question, the, idea, that, indian, tantrism, developed, in, shaivism, first, and, that, it, was, then, adopted, into, buddhism, davidson, points, to, the, difficulties, of, establishing, a, chronology, for, the, shaiva, tantric, literature, and, argues, that, both, traditions, developed, side, by, side, drawing, on, each, other, as, well, as, on, local, indian, tribal, religion, whatever, the, case, this, new, tantric, form, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, became, extremely, influential, in, india, especially, in, kashmir, and, in, the, lands, of, the, pala, empire, it, eventually, also, spread, north, into, central, asia, the, tibetan, plateau, and, to, east, asia, vajray, na, remains, the, dominant, form, of, buddhism, in, tibet, in, surrounding, regions, like, bhutan, and, in, mongolia, esoteric, elements, are, also, an, important, part, of, east, asian, buddhism, where, it, is, referred, to, by, various, terms, these, include, zh, ny, n, chinese, literally, true, word, referring, to, mantra, m, jiao, chinese, esoteric, teaching, m, z, ng, esoteric, tradition, or, t, ngm, tang, dynasty, esoterica, in, chinese, and, shingon, tomitsu, mikkyo, and, taimitsu, in, japanese, few, things, can, be, said, with, certainty, about, mah, y, na, buddhism, in, general, other, than, that, the, buddhism, practiced, in, china, indonesia, vietnam, korea, tibet, mongolia, and, japan, is, mah, y, na, buddhism, mah, y, na, can, be, described, as, a, loosely, bound, collection, of, many, teachings, and, practices, some, of, which, are, seemingly, contradictory, mah, y, na, constitutes, an, inclusive, and, broad, set, of, traditions, characterized, by, plurality, and, the, adoption, of, a, vast, number, of, new, sutras, ideas, and, philosophical, treatises, in, addition, to, the, earlier, buddhist, texts, broadly, speaking, mah, y, na, buddhists, accept, the, classic, buddhist, doctrines, found, in, early, buddhism, i, e, the, nik, ya, and, gamas, such, as, the, middle, way, dependent, origination, the, four, noble, truths, the, noble, eightfold, path, the, three, jewels, the, three, marks, of, existence, and, the, bodhipak, adharmas, aids, to, awakening, mah, y, na, buddhism, further, accepts, some, of, the, ideas, found, in, buddhist, abhidharma, thought, however, mah, y, na, also, adds, numerous, mah, y, na, texts, and, doctrines, which, are, seen, as, definitive, and, in, some, cases, superior, teachings, d, t, suzuki, described, the, broad, range, and, doctrinal, liberality, of, mah, y, na, as, a, vast, ocean, where, all, kinds, of, living, beings, are, allowed, to, thrive, in, a, most, generous, manner, almost, verging, on, a, chaos, paul, williams, refers, to, the, main, impulse, behind, mah, y, na, as, the, vision, which, sees, the, motivation, to, achieve, buddhahood, for, sake, of, other, beings, as, being, the, supreme, religious, motivation, this, is, the, way, that, atisha, defines, mah, y, na, in, his, bodhipathapradipa, as, such, according, to, williams, mah, y, na, is, not, as, such, an, institutional, identity, rather, it, is, inner, motivation, and, vision, and, this, inner, vision, can, be, found, in, anyone, regardless, of, their, institutional, position, thus, instead, of, a, specific, school, or, sect, mah, y, na, is, a, family, term, or, a, religious, tendency, which, is, united, by, a, vision, of, the, ultimate, goal, of, attaining, full, buddhahood, for, the, benefit, of, all, sentient, beings, the, bodhisattva, ideal, and, also, or, eventually, a, belief, that, buddhas, are, still, around, and, can, be, contacted, hence, the, possibility, of, an, ongoing, revelation, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, beings, on, their, way, to, buddhahood, are, central, elements, of, mah, y, na, mah, y, na, has, a, vastly, expanded, cosmology, and, theology, with, various, buddhas, and, powerful, bodhisattvas, residing, in, different, worlds, and, buddha, fields, buddha, kshetra, buddhas, unique, to, mah, y, na, include, the, buddhas, amit, bha, infinite, light, ak, obhya, the, imperturbable, bhai, ajyaguru, medicine, guru, and, vairocana, the, illuminator, in, mah, y, na, a, buddha, is, seen, as, a, being, that, has, achieved, the, highest, kind, of, awakening, due, to, his, superior, compassion, and, wish, to, help, all, beings, an, important, feature, of, mah, y, na, is, the, way, that, it, understands, the, nature, of, a, buddha, which, differs, from, non, mah, y, na, understandings, mah, y, na, texts, not, only, often, depict, numerous, buddhas, besides, sakyamuni, but, see, them, as, transcendental, or, supramundane, lokuttara, beings, with, great, powers, and, huge, lifetimes, the, white, lotus, sutra, famously, describes, the, lifespan, of, the, buddha, as, immeasurable, and, states, that, he, actually, achieved, buddhahood, countless, of, eons, kalpas, ago, and, has, been, teaching, the, dharma, through, his, numerous, avatars, for, an, unimaginable, period, of, time, furthermore, buddhas, are, active, in, the, world, constantly, devising, ways, to, teach, and, help, all, sentient, beings, according, to, paul, williams, in, mah, y, na, a, buddha, is, often, seen, as, a, spiritual, king, relating, to, and, caring, for, the, world, rather, than, simply, a, teacher, who, after, his, death, has, completely, gone, beyond, the, world, and, its, cares, buddha, sakyamuni, s, life, and, death, on, earth, are, then, usually, understood, docetically, as, a, mere, appearance, his, death, is, a, show, while, in, actuality, he, remains, out, of, compassion, to, help, all, sentient, beings, similarly, guang, xing, describes, the, buddha, in, mah, y, na, as, an, omnipotent, and, almighty, divinity, endowed, with, numerous, supernatural, attributes, and, qualities, mahayana, buddhologies, have, often, been, compared, to, various, types, of, theism, including, pantheism, by, different, scholars, though, there, is, disagreement, among, scholars, regarding, this, issue, as, well, on, the, general, relationship, between, buddhism, and, theism, the, idea, that, buddhas, remain, accessible, is, extremely, influential, in, mah, y, na, and, also, allows, for, the, possibility, of, having, a, reciprocal, relationship, with, a, buddha, through, prayer, visions, devotion, and, revelations, through, the, use, of, various, practices, a, mah, y, na, devotee, can, aspire, to, be, reborn, in, a, buddha, s, pure, land, or, buddha, field, buddhak, etra, where, they, can, strive, towards, buddhahood, in, the, best, possible, conditions, depending, on, the, sect, liberation, into, a, buddha, field, can, be, obtained, by, faith, meditation, or, sometimes, even, by, the, repetition, of, buddha, s, name, faith, based, devotional, practices, focused, on, rebirth, in, pure, lands, are, common, in, east, asia, pure, land, buddhism, the, influential, mah, y, na, concept, of, the, three, bodies, trik, ya, of, a, buddha, developed, to, make, sense, of, the, transcendental, nature, of, the, buddha, this, doctrine, holds, that, the, bodies, of, magical, transformation, nirm, ak, yas, and, the, enjoyment, bodies, sa, bhogak, ya, are, emanations, from, the, ultimate, buddha, body, the, dharmakaya, which, is, none, other, than, the, ultimate, reality, itself, i, e, emptiness, or, thusness, the, mah, y, na, bodhisattva, path, m, rga, or, vehicle, y, na, is, seen, as, being, the, superior, spiritual, path, by, mah, y, nists, over, and, above, the, paths, of, those, who, seek, arhatship, or, solitary, buddhahood, for, their, own, sake, r, vakay, na, and, pratyekabuddhay, na, mah, y, na, buddhists, generally, hold, that, pursuing, only, the, personal, release, from, suffering, i, e, nirv, a, is, a, smaller, or, inferior, aspiration, called, hinayana, because, it, lacks, the, wish, and, resolve, to, liberate, all, other, sentient, beings, from, sa, s, ra, the, round, of, rebirth, by, becoming, a, buddha, this, wish, to, help, others, by, entering, the, mah, y, na, path, is, called, bodhicitta, and, someone, who, engages, in, this, path, to, complete, buddhahood, is, a, bodhisattva, high, level, bodhisattvas, with, eons, of, practice, are, seen, as, extremely, powerful, supramundane, beings, they, are, objects, of, devotion, and, prayer, throughout, the, mah, y, na, world, popular, bodhisattvas, which, are, revered, across, mah, y, na, include, avalokiteshvara, manjushri, tara, and, maitreya, bodhisattvas, could, reach, the, personal, nirvana, of, the, arhats, but, they, reject, this, goal, and, remain, in, sa, s, ra, to, help, others, out, of, compassion, according, to, eighth, century, mah, y, na, philosopher, haribhadra, the, term, bodhisattva, can, technically, refer, to, those, who, follow, any, of, the, three, vehicles, since, all, are, working, towards, bodhi, awakening, and, hence, the, technical, term, for, a, mah, y, na, bodhisattva, is, a, mah, sattva, great, being, bodhisattva, according, to, paul, williams, a, mah, y, na, bodhisattva, is, best, defined, as, that, being, who, has, taken, the, vow, to, be, reborn, no, matter, how, many, times, this, may, be, necessary, in, order, to, attain, the, highest, possible, goal, that, of, complete, and, perfect, buddhahood, this, is, for, the, benefit, of, all, sentient, beings, there, are, two, models, for, the, nature, of, the, bodhisattvas, which, are, seen, in, the, various, mah, y, na, texts, one, is, the, idea, that, a, bodhisattva, must, postpone, their, awakening, until, full, buddhahood, is, attained, this, could, take, eons, and, in, the, meantime, they, will, help, countless, beings, after, reaching, buddhahood, they, do, pass, on, to, nirv, a, after, which, they, do, not, return, the, second, model, is, the, idea, that, there, are, two, kinds, of, nirv, a, the, nirv, a, of, an, arhat, and, a, superior, type, of, nirv, a, called, aprati, hita, non, abiding, not, established, that, allows, a, buddha, to, remain, forever, engaged, in, the, world, as, noted, by, paul, williams, the, idea, of, aprati, hita, nirv, a, may, have, taken, some, time, to, develop, and, is, not, obvious, in, some, of, the, early, mah, y, na, literature, in, most, classic, mah, y, na, sources, as, well, as, in, non, mah, y, na, sources, on, the, topic, the, bodhisattva, path, is, said, to, take, three, or, four, asa, kheyyas, incalculable, eons, requiring, a, huge, number, of, lifetimes, of, practice, to, complete, however, certain, practices, are, sometimes, held, to, provide, shortcuts, to, buddhahood, these, vary, widely, by, tradition, according, to, the, bodhipathaprad, pa, a, lamp, for, the, path, to, awakening, by, the, indian, master, ati, a, the, central, defining, feature, of, a, bodhisattva, s, path, is, the, universal, aspiration, to, end, suffering, for, themselves, and, all, other, beings, i, e, bodhicitta, the, bodhisattva, s, spiritual, path, is, traditionally, held, to, begin, with, the, revolutionary, event, called, the, arising, of, the, awakening, mind, bodhicittotp, da, which, is, the, wish, to, become, a, buddha, in, order, to, help, all, beings, this, is, achieved, in, different, ways, such, as, the, meditation, taught, by, the, indian, master, shantideva, in, his, bodhicaryavatara, called, equalising, self, and, others, and, exchanging, self, and, others, other, indian, masters, like, atisha, and, kamalashila, also, teach, a, meditation, in, which, we, contemplate, how, all, beings, have, been, our, close, relatives, or, friends, in, past, lives, this, contemplation, leads, to, the, arising, of, deep, love, maitr, and, compassion, karu, for, others, and, thus, bodhicitta, is, generated, according, to, the, indian, philosopher, shantideva, when, great, compassion, and, bodhicitta, arises, in, a, person, s, heart, they, cease, to, be, an, ordinary, person, and, become, a, son, or, daughter, of, the, buddhas, the, idea, of, the, bodhisattva, is, not, unique, to, mah, y, na, buddhism, and, it, is, found, in, theravada, and, other, early, buddhist, schools, however, these, schools, held, that, becoming, a, bodhisattva, required, a, prediction, of, one, s, future, buddhahood, in, the, presence, of, a, living, buddha, in, mah, y, na, the, term, bodhisattva, is, applicable, to, any, person, from, the, moment, they, intend, to, become, a, buddha, i, e, the, moment, in, which, bodhicitta, arises, in, their, mind, and, without, the, requirement, of, a, living, buddha, being, present, some, mah, y, na, s, tras, like, the, lotus, sutra, promote, the, bodhisattva, path, as, being, universal, and, open, to, everyone, other, texts, disagree, with, this, and, state, that, only, some, beings, have, the, capacity, for, buddhahood, the, generation, of, bodhicitta, may, then, be, followed, by, the, taking, of, the, bodhisattva, vows, pra, idh, na, to, lead, to, nirvana, the, whole, immeasurable, world, of, beings, as, the, praj, aparamita, sutras, state, this, compassionate, commitment, to, help, others, is, the, central, characteristic, of, the, mah, y, na, bodhisattva, these, vows, may, be, accompanied, by, certain, ethical, guidelines, called, bodhisattva, precepts, numerous, sutras, also, state, that, a, key, part, of, the, bodhisattva, path, is, the, practice, of, a, set, of, virtues, called, p, ramit, s, transcendent, or, supreme, virtues, sometimes, six, are, outlined, giving, ethical, discipline, patient, endurance, diligence, meditation, and, transcendent, wisdom, other, sutras, like, the, da, abh, mika, give, a, list, of, ten, with, the, addition, of, up, ya, skillful, means, pra, idh, na, vow, resolution, bala, spiritual, power, and, j, na, knowledge, praj, transcendent, knowledge, or, wisdom, is, arguably, the, most, important, virtue, of, the, bodhisattva, this, refers, to, an, understanding, of, the, emptiness, of, all, phenomena, arising, from, study, deep, consideration, and, meditation, various, mah, y, na, buddhist, scriptures, associate, the, beginning, of, the, bodhisattva, practice, with, what, is, called, the, path, of, accumulation, or, equipment, sa, bh, ra, m, rga, which, is, the, first, path, of, the, classic, five, paths, schema, the, da, abh, mika, s, tra, as, well, as, other, texts, also, outline, a, series, of, bodhisattva, levels, or, spiritual, stages, bh, mis, on, the, path, to, buddhahood, the, various, texts, disagree, on, the, number, of, stages, however, the, da, abh, mika, giving, ten, for, example, and, mapping, each, one, to, the, ten, paramitas, the, bodhisattvabh, mi, giving, seven, and, thirteen, and, the, avatamsaka, outlining, 40, stages, in, later, mah, y, na, scholasticism, such, as, in, the, work, of, kamalashila, and, ati, a, the, five, paths, and, ten, bh, mi, systems, are, merged, and, this, is, the, progressive, path, model, that, is, used, in, tibetan, buddhism, according, to, paul, williams, in, these, systems, the, first, bh, mi, is, reached, once, one, attains, direct, nonconceptual, and, nondual, insight, into, emptiness, in, meditative, absorption, which, is, associated, with, the, path, of, seeing, dar, ana, m, rga, at, this, point, a, bodhisattva, is, considered, an, rya, a, noble, being, skillful, means, or, expedient, techniques, skt, up, ya, is, another, important, virtue, and, doctrine, in, mah, y, na, buddhism, the, idea, is, most, famously, expounded, in, the, white, lotus, sutra, and, refers, to, any, effective, method, or, technique, that, is, conducive, to, spiritual, growth, and, leads, beings, to, awakening, and, nirvana, this, doctrine, states, that, out, of, compassion, the, buddha, adapts, his, teaching, to, whomever, he, is, teaching, because, of, this, it, is, possible, that, the, buddha, may, teach, seemingly, contradictory, things, to, different, people, this, idea, is, also, used, to, explain, the, vast, textual, corpus, found, in, mah, y, na, a, closely, related, teaching, is, the, doctrine, of, the, one, vehicle, ekay, na, this, teaching, states, that, even, though, the, buddha, is, said, to, have, taught, three, vehicles, the, disciples, vehicle, the, vehicle, of, solitary, buddhas, and, the, bodhisattva, vehicle, which, are, accepted, by, all, early, buddhist, schools, these, actually, are, all, skillful, means, which, lead, to, the, same, place, buddhahood, therefore, there, really, are, not, three, vehicles, in, an, ultimate, sense, but, one, vehicle, the, supreme, vehicle, of, the, buddhas, which, is, taught, in, different, ways, depending, on, the, faculties, of, individuals, even, those, beings, who, think, they, have, finished, the, path, i, e, the, arhats, are, actually, not, done, and, they, will, eventually, reach, buddhahood, this, doctrine, was, not, accepted, in, full, by, all, mah, y, na, traditions, the, yog, c, ra, school, famously, defended, an, alternative, theory, that, held, that, not, all, beings, could, become, buddhas, this, became, a, subject, of, much, debate, throughout, mah, y, na, buddhist, history, some, of, the, key, mah, y, na, teachings, are, found, in, the, praj, p, ramit, transcendent, knowledge, or, perfection, of, wisdom, texts, which, are, some, of, the, earliest, mah, y, na, works, praj, p, ramit, is, a, deep, knowledge, of, reality, which, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, attain, it, is, a, transcendent, non, conceptual, and, non, dual, kind, of, knowledge, into, the, true, nature, of, things, this, wisdom, is, also, associated, with, insight, into, the, emptiness, nyat, of, dharmas, phenomena, and, their, illusory, nature, m, y, this, amounts, to, the, idea, that, all, phenomena, dharmas, without, exception, have, no, essential, unchanging, core, i, e, they, lack, svabh, va, an, essence, or, inherent, nature, and, therefore, have, no, fundamentally, real, existence, these, empty, phenomena, are, also, said, to, be, conceptual, constructions, because, of, this, all, dharmas, things, phenomena, even, the, buddha, s, teaching, the, buddha, himself, nirv, a, and, all, living, beings, are, like, illusions, or, magic, m, y, and, dreams, svapna, this, emptiness, or, lack, of, real, existence, applies, even, to, the, apparent, arising, and, ceasing, of, phenomena, because, of, this, all, phenomena, are, also, described, as, unarisen, anutp, da, unborn, ajata, beyond, coming, and, going, in, the, praj, p, ramit, literature, most, famously, the, heart, sutra, states, that, all, phenomena, are, empty, that, is, without, characteristic, unproduced, unceased, stainless, not, stainless, undiminished, unfilled, the, praj, p, ramit, texts, also, use, various, metaphors, to, describe, the, nature, of, things, for, example, the, diamond, sutra, compares, phenomena, to, a, shooting, star, a, clouding, of, the, sight, a, lamp, an, illusion, a, drop, of, dew, a, bubble, a, dream, a, lightning, s, flash, a, thunder, cloud, praj, p, ramit, is, also, associated, with, not, grasping, not, taking, a, stand, on, or, not, taking, up, aparig, h, ta, anything, in, the, world, the, a, as, hasrik, praj, p, ramit, s, tra, explains, it, as, not, grasping, at, form, not, grasping, at, sensation, perception, volitions, and, cognition, this, includes, not, grasping, or, taking, up, even, correct, buddhist, ideas, or, mental, signs, such, as, not, self, emptiness, bodhicitta, vows, since, these, things, are, ultimately, all, empty, concepts, as, well, attaining, a, state, of, fearless, receptivity, ksanti, through, the, insight, into, the, true, nature, of, reality, dharmat, in, an, intuitive, non, conceptual, manner, is, said, to, be, the, praj, p, ramit, the, highest, spiritual, wisdom, according, to, edward, conze, the, patient, acceptance, of, the, non, arising, of, dharmas, anutpattika, dharmakshanti, is, one, of, the, most, distinctive, virtues, of, the, mah, y, nistic, saint, the, praj, p, ramit, texts, also, claim, that, this, training, is, not, just, for, mah, y, nists, but, for, all, buddhists, following, any, of, the, three, vehicles, religion, portal, the, mah, y, na, philosophical, school, termed, madhyamaka, middle, theory, or, centrism, also, known, as, nyav, da, the, emptiness, theory, was, founded, by, the, second, century, figure, of, nagarjuna, this, philosophical, tradition, focuses, on, refuting, all, theories, which, posit, any, kind, of, substance, inherent, existence, or, intrinsic, nature, svabh, va, in, his, writings, nagarjuna, attempts, to, show, that, any, theory, of, intrinsic, nature, is, contradicted, by, the, buddha, s, theory, of, dependent, origination, since, anything, that, has, an, independent, existence, cannot, be, dependently, originated, the, nyav, da, philosophers, were, adamant, that, their, denial, of, svabh, va, is, not, a, kind, of, nihilism, against, protestations, to, the, contrary, by, their, opponents, using, the, two, truths, theory, madhyamaka, claims, that, while, one, can, speak, of, things, existing, in, a, conventional, relative, sense, they, do, not, exist, inherently, in, an, ultimate, sense, madhyamaka, also, argues, that, emptiness, itself, is, also, empty, it, does, not, have, an, absolute, inherent, existence, of, its, own, it, is, also, not, to, be, understood, as, a, transcendental, absolute, reality, instead, the, emptiness, theory, is, merely, a, useful, concept, that, should, not, be, clung, to, in, fact, for, madhyamaka, since, everything, is, empty, of, true, existence, all, things, are, just, conceptualizations, praj, apti, matra, including, the, theory, of, emptiness, and, all, concepts, must, ultimately, be, abandoned, in, order, to, truly, understand, the, nature, of, things, vij, nav, da, the, doctrine, of, consciousness, a, k, a, vij, apti, m, tra, perceptions, only, and, citta, m, tra, mind, only, is, another, important, doctrine, promoted, by, some, mah, y, na, sutras, which, later, became, the, central, theory, of, a, major, philosophical, movement, which, arose, during, the, gupta, period, called, yog, c, ra, the, primary, sutra, associated, with, this, school, of, thought, is, the, sa, dhinirmocana, s, tra, which, claims, that, nyav, da, is, not, the, final, definitive, teaching, n, t, rtha, of, the, buddha, instead, the, ultimate, truth, param, rtha, satya, is, said, to, be, the, view, that, all, things, dharmas, are, only, mind, citta, consciousness, vij, na, or, perceptions, vij, apti, and, that, seemingly, external, objects, or, internal, subjects, do, not, really, exist, apart, from, the, dependently, originated, flow, of, mental, experiences, when, this, flow, of, mentality, is, seen, as, being, empty, of, the, subject, object, duality, we, impose, upon, it, one, reaches, the, non, dual, cognition, of, thusness, tathat, which, is, nirvana, this, doctrine, is, developed, through, various, theories, the, most, important, being, the, eight, consciousnesses, and, the, three, natures, the, sa, dhinirmocana, calls, its, doctrine, the, third, turning, of, the, dharma, wheel, the, pratyutpanna, sutra, also, mentions, this, doctrine, stating, whatever, belongs, to, this, triple, world, is, nothing, but, thought, why, is, that, it, is, because, however, i, imagine, things, that, is, how, they, appear, the, most, influential, thinkers, in, this, tradition, were, the, indian, brothers, asanga, and, vasubandhu, yog, c, ra, philosophers, developed, their, own, interpretation, of, the, doctrine, of, emptiness, which, also, criticized, madhyamaka, in, effect, claiming, it, fell, into, nihilism, the, doctrine, of, tath, gata, embryo, or, tath, gata, womb, tath, gatagarbha, also, known, as, buddha, nature, matrix, or, principle, skt, buddha, dh, tu, is, important, in, all, modern, mah, y, na, traditions, though, it, is, interpreted, in, many, different, ways, broadly, speaking, buddha, nature, is, concerned, with, explaining, what, allows, sentient, beings, to, become, buddhas, the, earliest, sources, for, this, idea, may, include, the, tath, gatagarbha, s, tra, and, the, mah, y, na, mah, parinirv, a, s, tra, the, mah, y, na, mah, parinirv, a, refers, to, a, sacred, nature, that, is, the, basis, for, becoming, buddhas, and, it, also, describes, it, as, the, self, atman, david, seyfort, ruegg, explains, this, concept, as, the, base, or, support, for, the, practice, of, the, path, and, thus, it, is, the, cause, hetu, for, the, fruit, of, buddhahood, the, tath, gatagarbha, s, tra, states, that, within, the, defilements, is, found, the, tathagata, s, wisdom, the, tathagata, s, vision, and, the, tathagata, s, body, eternally, unsullied, and, replete, with, virtues, no, different, from, my, own, the, tathagatagarbhas, of, all, beings, are, eternal, and, unchanging, the, ideas, found, in, the, buddha, nature, literature, are, a, source, of, much, debate, and, disagreement, among, mah, y, na, buddhist, philosophers, as, well, as, modern, academics, some, scholars, have, seen, this, as, an, influence, from, brahmanic, hinduism, and, some, of, these, sutras, admit, that, the, use, of, the, term, self, is, partly, done, in, order, to, win, over, non, buddhist, ascetics, in, other, words, it, is, a, skillful, means, according, to, some, scholars, the, buddha, nature, discussed, in, some, mah, y, na, s, tras, does, not, represent, a, substantial, self, tman, which, the, buddha, critiqued, rather, it, is, a, positive, expression, of, emptiness, nyat, and, represents, the, potentiality, to, realize, buddhahood, through, buddhist, practices, similarly, williams, thinks, that, this, doctrine, was, not, originally, dealing, with, ontological, issues, but, with, religious, issues, of, realising, one, s, spiritual, potential, exhortation, and, encouragement, the, buddha, nature, genre, of, s, tras, can, be, seen, as, an, attempt, to, state, buddhist, teachings, using, positive, language, while, also, maintaining, the, middle, way, to, prevent, people, from, being, turned, away, from, buddhism, by, a, false, impression, of, nihilism, this, is, the, position, taken, by, the, la, k, vat, ra, s, tra, which, states, that, the, buddhas, teach, the, doctrine, of, tath, gatagarbha, which, sounds, similar, to, an, atman, in, order, to, help, those, beings, who, are, attached, to, the, idea, of, anatman, however, the, sutra, goes, on, to, say, that, the, tath, gatagarbha, is, empty, and, is, not, actually, a, substantial, self, a, different, view, is, defended, by, various, modern, scholars, like, michael, zimmermann, this, view, is, the, idea, that, buddha, nature, sutras, such, as, the, mah, parinirv, a, and, the, tath, gatagarbha, s, tra, teach, an, affirmative, vision, of, an, eternal, indestructible, buddhic, self, shenpen, hookham, a, western, scholar, and, lama, sees, buddha, nature, as, a, true, self, that, is, real, and, permanent, similarly, c, d, sebastian, understands, the, ratnagotravibh, ga, s, view, of, this, topic, as, a, transcendental, self, that, is, the, unique, essence, of, the, universe, indian, mah, y, na, buddhists, faced, various, criticisms, from, non, mah, y, nists, regarding, the, authenticity, of, their, teachings, the, main, critique, they, faced, was, that, mah, y, na, teachings, had, not, been, taught, by, the, buddha, but, were, invented, by, later, figures, numerous, mah, y, na, texts, discuss, this, issue, and, attempt, to, defend, the, truth, and, authenticity, of, mah, y, na, in, various, ways, one, idea, that, mah, y, na, texts, put, forth, is, that, mah, y, na, teachings, were, taught, later, because, most, people, were, unable, to, understand, the, mah, y, na, s, tras, at, the, time, of, the, buddha, and, that, people, were, ready, to, hear, the, mah, y, na, only, in, later, times, certain, traditional, accounts, state, that, mah, y, na, sutras, were, hidden, away, or, kept, safe, by, divine, beings, like, nagas, or, bodhisattvas, until, the, time, came, for, their, dissemination, similarly, some, sources, also, state, that, mah, y, na, teachings, were, revealed, by, other, buddhas, bodhisattvas, and, devas, to, a, select, number, of, individuals, often, through, visions, or, dreams, some, scholars, have, seen, a, connection, between, this, idea, and, mah, y, na, meditation, practices, which, involve, the, visualization, of, buddhas, and, their, buddha, lands, another, argument, that, indian, buddhists, used, in, favor, of, the, mah, y, na, is, that, its, teachings, are, true, and, lead, to, awakening, since, they, are, in, line, with, the, dharma, because, of, this, they, can, be, said, to, be, well, said, subhasita, and, therefore, they, can, be, said, to, be, the, word, of, the, buddha, in, this, sense, this, idea, that, whatever, is, well, spoken, is, the, buddha, s, word, can, be, traced, to, the, earliest, buddhist, texts, but, it, is, interpreted, more, widely, in, mah, y, na, from, the, mah, y, na, point, of, view, a, teaching, is, the, word, of, the, buddha, because, it, is, in, accord, with, the, dharma, not, because, it, was, spoken, by, a, specific, individual, i, e, gautama, this, idea, can, be, seen, in, the, writings, of, shantideva, 8th, century, who, argues, that, an, inspired, utterance, is, the, buddha, word, if, it, is, connected, with, the, truth, connected, with, the, dharma, brings, about, renunciation, of, kleshas, not, their, increase, and, it, shows, the, laudable, qualities, of, nirvana, not, those, of, samsara, the, modern, japanese, zen, buddhist, scholar, d, t, suzuki, similarly, argued, that, while, the, mah, y, na, s, tras, may, not, have, been, directly, taught, by, the, historical, buddha, the, spirit, and, central, ideas, of, mah, y, na, derive, from, the, buddha, according, to, suzuki, mah, y, na, evolved, and, adapted, itself, to, suit, the, times, by, developing, new, teachings, and, texts, while, maintaining, the, spirit, of, the, buddha, mah, y, na, often, sees, itself, as, penetrating, further, and, more, profoundly, into, the, buddha, s, dharma, an, indian, commentary, on, the, mah, y, nasa, graha, gives, a, classification, of, teachings, according, to, the, capabilities, of, the, audience, according, to, disciples, grades, the, dharma, is, classified, as, inferior, and, superior, for, example, the, inferior, was, taught, to, the, merchants, trapu, a, and, ballika, because, they, were, ordinary, men, the, middle, was, taught, to, the, group, of, five, because, they, were, at, the, stage, of, saints, the, eightfold, praj, p, ramit, s, were, taught, to, bodhisattvas, and, are, superior, in, eliminating, conceptually, imagined, forms, viv, taguhy, rthapi, avy, khy, there, is, also, a, tendency, in, mah, y, na, s, tras, to, regard, adherence, to, these, s, tras, as, generating, spiritual, benefits, greater, than, those, that, arise, from, being, a, follower, of, the, non, mah, y, na, approaches, thus, the, r, m, l, dev, si, han, da, s, tra, claims, that, the, buddha, said, that, devotion, to, mah, y, na, is, inherently, superior, in, its, virtues, to, following, the, r, vaka, or, pratyekabuddha, paths, the, commentary, on, the, abhidharmasamuccaya, gives, the, following, seven, reasons, for, the, greatness, of, the, mahayana, mah, y, na, buddhist, practice, is, quite, varied, a, common, set, of, virtues, and, practices, which, is, shared, by, all, mah, y, na, traditions, are, the, six, perfections, or, transcendent, virtues, p, ramit, a, central, practice, advocated, by, numerous, mah, y, na, sources, is, focused, around, the, acquisition, of, merit, the, universal, currency, of, the, buddhist, world, a, vast, quantity, of, which, was, believed, to, be, necessary, for, the, attainment, of, buddhahood, another, important, class, of, mah, y, na, buddhist, practice, are, textual, practices, that, deal, with, listening, to, memorizing, reciting, preaching, worshipping, and, copying, mah, y, na, s, tras, buddhist, preachers, affiliated, with, mahayana, groups, tend, to, focus, on, the, importance, of, the, concepts, of, reincarnation, and, nirvana, mah, y, na, s, tras, especially, those, of, the, praj, p, ramit, genre, teach, the, practice, of, the, six, transcendent, virtues, or, perfections, p, ramit, as, part, of, the, path, to, buddhahood, special, attention, is, given, to, transcendent, knowledge, praj, p, ramit, which, is, seen, as, a, primary, virtue, according, to, donald, s, lopez, jr, the, term, p, ramit, can, mean, excellence, or, perfection, as, well, as, that, which, has, gone, beyond, or, transcendence, the, praj, ap, ramit, s, tras, and, a, large, number, of, other, mah, y, na, texts, list, six, perfections, this, list, is, also, mentioned, by, the, therav, da, commentator, dhammapala, who, describes, it, as, a, categorization, of, the, same, ten, perfections, of, theravada, buddhism, according, to, dhammapala, sacca, is, classified, as, both, la, and, praj, mett, and, upekkh, are, classified, as, dhy, na, and, adhi, h, na, falls, under, all, six, bhikkhu, bodhi, states, that, the, correlations, between, the, two, sets, show, there, was, a, shared, core, before, the, theravada, and, mahayana, schools, split, in, the, ten, stages, sutra, and, the, mah, ratnak, a, s, tra, four, more, p, ramit, s, are, listed, mah, y, na, buddhism, teaches, a, vast, array, of, meditation, practices, these, include, meditations, which, are, shared, with, the, early, buddhist, traditions, including, mindfulness, of, breathing, mindfulness, of, the, unattractivenes, of, the, body, loving, kindness, the, contemplation, of, dependent, origination, and, mindfulness, of, the, buddha, in, chinese, buddhism, these, five, practices, are, known, as, the, five, methods, for, stilling, or, pacifying, the, mind, and, support, the, development, of, the, stages, of, dhyana, the, yog, c, rabh, mi, stra, compiled, c, 4th, century, which, is, the, most, comprehensive, indian, treatise, on, mah, y, na, practice, discusses, classic, buddhist, numerous, meditation, methods, and, topics, including, the, four, dhy, nas, the, different, kinds, of, sam, dhi, the, development, of, insight, vipa, yan, and, tranquility, amatha, the, four, foundations, of, mindfulness, sm, tyupasth, na, the, five, hindrances, nivara, a, and, classic, buddhist, meditations, such, as, the, contemplation, of, unattractiveness, impermanence, anitya, suffering, du, kha, and, contemplation, death, mara, asa, j, other, works, of, the, yog, c, ra, school, such, as, asa, ga, s, abhidharmasamuccaya, and, vasubandhu, s, madhy, ntavibh, ga, bh, sya, also, discuss, meditation, topics, such, as, mindfulness, sm, tyupasth, na, the, 37, wings, to, awakening, and, samadhi, a, very, popular, mah, y, na, practice, from, very, early, times, involved, the, visualization, of, a, buddha, while, practicing, mindfulness, of, a, buddha, buddh, nusm, ti, along, with, their, pure, land, this, practice, could, lead, the, meditator, to, feel, that, they, were, in, the, presence, of, the, buddha, and, in, some, cases, it, was, held, that, it, could, lead, to, visions, of, the, buddhas, through, which, one, could, receive, teachings, from, them, this, meditation, is, taught, in, numerous, mah, y, na, s, tras, such, as, the, pure, land, sutras, the, ak, obhya, vy, ha, and, the, pratyutpanna, sam, dhi, the, pratyutpanna, states, that, through, mindfulness, of, the, buddha, meditation, one, may, be, able, to, meet, this, buddha, in, a, vision, or, a, dream, and, learn, from, them, similarly, the, sam, dhir, ja, s, tra, for, states, that, those, who, while, walking, sitting, standing, or, sleeping, recollect, the, moon, like, buddha, will, always, be, in, buddha, s, presence, and, will, attain, the, vast, nirv, a, his, pure, body, is, the, colour, of, gold, beautiful, is, the, protector, of, the, world, whoever, visualizes, him, like, this, practises, the, meditation, of, the, bodhisattvas, in, the, case, of, pure, land, buddhism, it, is, widely, held, that, the, practice, of, reciting, the, buddha, s, name, called, nianfo, in, chinese, and, nembutsu, in, japanese, can, lead, to, rebirth, in, a, buddha, s, pure, land, as, well, as, other, positive, outcomes, in, east, asian, buddhism, the, most, popular, buddha, used, for, this, practice, is, amitabha, east, asian, mah, y, na, buddhism, also, teaches, numerous, unique, meditation, methods, including, the, chan, zen, practices, of, huatou, koan, meditation, and, silent, illumination, chinese, m, zh, o, which, developed, into, the, japanese, shikantaza, method, indo, tibetan, buddhism, also, includes, numerous, unique, forms, of, mah, y, na, contemplations, such, as, tonglen, sending, and, receiving, lojong, mind, training, and, samatha, vipasyana, there, are, also, numerous, meditative, practices, that, are, generally, considered, to, be, part, of, a, separate, category, rather, than, general, or, mainstream, mah, y, na, meditation, these, are, the, various, practices, associated, with, vajray, na, also, termed, mantray, na, secret, mantra, buddhist, tantra, and, esoteric, buddhism, this, family, of, practices, which, include, such, varied, forms, as, deity, yoga, dzogchen, mahamudra, the, six, dharmas, of, n, ropa, the, recitation, of, mantras, and, dharanis, and, the, use, of, mudras, and, mandalas, are, very, important, in, tibetan, buddhism, as, well, as, in, some, forms, of, east, asian, mantray, na, like, chinese, esoteric, buddhism, shingon, and, tendai, mah, y, na, buddhism, takes, the, basic, teachings, of, the, buddha, as, recorded, in, early, scriptures, as, the, starting, point, of, its, teachings, such, as, those, concerning, karma, and, rebirth, an, tman, emptiness, dependent, origination, and, the, four, noble, truths, mah, y, na, buddhists, in, east, asia, have, traditionally, studied, these, teachings, in, the, gamas, preserved, in, the, chinese, buddhist, canon, gama, is, the, term, used, by, those, traditional, buddhist, schools, in, india, who, employed, sanskrit, for, their, basic, canon, these, correspond, to, the, nik, yas, used, by, the, therav, da, school, the, surviving, gamas, in, chinese, translation, belong, to, at, least, two, schools, most, of, the, gamas, were, never, translated, into, the, tibetan, canon, which, according, to, hirakawa, only, contains, a, few, translations, of, early, sutras, corresponding, to, the, nik, yas, or, gamas, however, these, basic, doctrines, are, contained, in, tibetan, translations, of, later, works, such, as, the, abhidharmako, a, and, the, yog, c, rabh, mi, stra, in, addition, to, accepting, the, essential, scriptures, of, the, early, buddhist, schools, as, valid, mah, y, na, buddhism, maintains, large, collections, of, s, tras, that, are, not, recognized, as, authentic, by, the, modern, therav, da, school, the, earliest, of, these, sutras, do, not, call, themselves, mah, y, na, but, use, the, terms, vaipulya, extensive, sutras, or, gambhira, profound, sutras, these, were, also, not, recognized, by, some, individuals, in, the, early, buddhist, schools, in, other, cases, buddhist, communities, such, as, the, mah, s, ghika, school, were, divided, along, these, doctrinal, lines, in, mah, y, na, buddhism, the, mah, y, na, s, tras, are, often, given, greater, authority, than, the, gamas, the, first, of, these, mah, y, na, specific, writings, were, written, probably, around, the, 1st, century, bce, or, 1st, century, ce, some, influential, mah, y, na, sutras, are, the, praj, aparamita, sutras, such, as, the, a, as, hasrik, praj, p, ramit, s, tra, the, lotus, sutra, the, pure, land, sutras, the, vimalakirti, sutra, the, golden, light, sutra, the, avatamsaka, sutra, the, sandhinirmocana, sutra, and, the, tath, gatagarbha, s, tras, according, to, david, drewes, mah, y, na, sutras, contain, several, elements, besides, the, promotion, of, the, bodhisattva, ideal, including, expanded, cosmologies, and, mythical, histories, ideas, of, purelands, and, great, celestial, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, descriptions, of, powerful, new, religious, practices, new, ideas, on, the, nature, of, the, buddha, and, a, range, of, new, philosophical, perspectives, these, texts, present, stories, of, revelation, in, which, the, buddha, teaches, mah, y, na, sutras, to, certain, bodhisattvas, who, vow, to, teach, and, spread, these, sutras, after, the, buddha, s, death, regarding, religious, praxis, david, drewes, outlines, the, most, commonly, promoted, practices, in, mah, y, na, sutras, were, seen, as, means, to, achieve, buddhahood, quickly, and, easily, and, included, hearing, the, names, of, certain, buddhas, or, bodhisattvas, maintaining, buddhist, precepts, and, listening, to, memorizing, and, copying, sutras, that, they, claim, can, enable, rebirth, in, the, pure, lands, abhirati, and, sukhavati, where, it, is, said, to, be, possible, to, easily, acquire, the, merit, and, knowledge, necessary, to, become, a, buddha, in, as, little, as, one, lifetime, another, widely, recommended, practice, is, anumodana, or, rejoicing, in, the, good, deeds, of, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, the, practice, of, meditation, and, visualization, of, buddhas, has, been, seen, by, some, scholars, as, a, possible, explanation, for, the, source, of, certain, mah, y, na, sutras, which, are, seen, traditionally, as, direct, visionary, revelations, from, the, buddhas, in, their, pure, lands, paul, harrison, has, also, noted, the, importance, of, dream, revelations, in, certain, mah, y, na, sutras, such, as, the, arya, svapna, nirdesa, which, lists, and, interprets, 108, dream, signs, as, noted, by, paul, williams, one, feature, of, mah, y, na, sutras, especially, earlier, ones, is, the, phenomenon, of, laudatory, self, reference, the, lengthy, praise, of, the, sutra, itself, the, immense, merits, to, be, obtained, from, treating, even, a, verse, of, it, with, reverence, and, the, nasty, penalties, which, will, accrue, in, accordance, with, karma, to, those, who, denigrate, the, scripture, some, mah, y, na, sutras, also, warn, against, the, accusation, that, they, are, not, the, word, of, the, buddha, buddhavacana, such, as, the, astas, hasrik, 8, 000, verse, praj, p, ramit, which, states, that, such, claims, come, from, mara, the, evil, tempter, some, of, these, mah, y, na, sutras, also, warn, those, who, would, denigrate, mah, y, na, sutras, or, those, who, preach, it, i, e, the, dharmabhanaka, that, this, action, can, lead, to, rebirth, in, hell, another, feature, of, some, mah, y, na, sutras, especially, later, ones, is, increasing, sectarianism, and, animosity, towards, non, mah, y, na, practitioners, sometimes, called, sravakas, hearers, which, are, sometimes, depicted, as, being, part, of, the, h, nay, na, the, inferior, way, who, refuse, to, accept, the, superior, way, of, the, mah, y, na, as, noted, by, paul, williams, earlier, mah, y, na, sutras, like, the, ugraparip, cch, s, tra, and, the, ajitasena, sutra, do, not, present, any, antagonism, towards, the, hearers, or, the, ideal, of, arhatship, like, later, sutras, do, regarding, the, bodhisattva, path, some, mah, y, na, sutras, promote, it, as, a, universal, path, for, everyone, while, others, like, the, ugraparip, cch, see, it, as, something, for, a, small, elite, of, hardcore, ascetics, in, the, 4th, century, mah, y, na, abhidharma, work, abhidharmasamuccaya, asa, ga, refers, to, the, collection, which, contains, the, gamas, as, the, r, vakapi, aka, and, associates, it, with, the, r, vakas, and, pratyekabuddhas, asa, ga, classifies, the, mah, y, na, s, tras, as, belonging, to, the, bodhisattvapi, aka, which, is, designated, as, the, collection, of, teachings, for, bodhisattvas, mah, y, na, buddhism, also, developed, a, massive, commentarial, and, exegetical, literature, many, of, which, are, called, stra, treatises, or, vrittis, commentaries, philosophical, texts, were, also, written, in, verse, form, karik, s, such, as, in, the, case, of, the, famous, m, lamadhyamika, karik, root, verses, on, the, middle, way, by, nagarjuna, the, foundational, text, of, madhyamika, philosophy, numerous, later, madhyamika, philosophers, like, candrakirti, wrote, commentaries, on, this, work, as, well, as, their, own, verse, works, mah, y, na, buddhist, tradition, also, relies, on, numerous, non, mahayana, commentaries, stra, a, very, influential, one, being, the, abhidharmakosha, of, vasubandhu, which, is, written, from, a, non, mahayana, sarvastivada, sautrantika, perspective, vasubandhu, is, also, the, author, of, various, mah, y, na, yogacara, texts, on, the, philosophical, theory, known, as, vij, apti, matra, conscious, construction, only, the, yogacara, school, philosopher, asanga, is, also, credited, with, numerous, highly, influential, commentaries, in, east, asia, the, satyasiddhi, stra, was, also, influential, another, influential, tradition, is, that, of, dign, ga, s, buddhist, logic, whose, work, focused, on, epistemology, he, produced, the, pram, nasamuccaya, and, later, dharmakirti, wrote, the, pram, nav, rttik, which, was, a, commentary, and, reworking, of, the, dignaga, text, later, tibetan, and, chinese, buddhists, continued, the, tradition, of, writing, commentaries, dating, back, at, least, to, the, sa, dhinirmocana, s, tra, is, a, classification, of, the, corpus, of, buddhism, into, three, categories, based, on, ways, of, understanding, the, nature, of, reality, known, as, the, three, turnings, of, the, dharma, wheel, according, to, this, view, there, were, three, such, turnings, some, traditions, of, tibetan, buddhism, consider, the, teachings, of, esoteric, buddhism, and, vajray, na, to, be, the, third, turning, of, the, dharma, wheel, tibetan, teachers, particularly, of, the, gelugpa, school, regard, the, second, turning, as, the, highest, teaching, because, of, their, particular, interpretation, of, yog, c, ra, doctrine, the, buddha, nature, teachings, are, normally, included, in, the, third, turning, of, the, wheel, the, different, chinese, buddhist, traditions, have, different, schemes, of, doctrinal, periodization, called, panjiao, which, they, use, to, organize, the, sometimes, bewildering, array, of, texts, scholars, have, noted, that, many, key, mah, y, na, ideas, are, closely, connected, to, the, earliest, texts, of, buddhism, the, seminal, work, of, mah, y, na, philosophy, n, g, rjuna, s, m, lamadhyamakak, rik, mentions, the, canon, s, katy, yana, s, tra, sa, 301, by, name, and, may, be, an, extended, commentary, on, that, work, n, g, rjuna, systematized, the, m, dhyamaka, school, of, mah, y, na, philosophy, he, may, have, arrived, at, his, positions, from, a, desire, to, achieve, a, consistent, exegesis, of, the, buddha, s, doctrine, as, recorded, in, the, canon, in, his, eyes, the, buddha, was, not, merely, a, forerunner, but, the, very, founder, of, the, m, dhyamaka, system, n, g, rjuna, also, referred, to, a, passage, in, the, canon, regarding, nirvanic, consciousness, in, two, different, works, yog, c, ra, the, other, prominent, mah, y, na, school, in, dialectic, with, the, m, dhyamaka, school, gave, a, special, significance, to, the, canon, s, lesser, discourse, on, emptiness, ma, 190, a, passage, there, which, the, discourse, itself, emphasizes, is, often, quoted, in, later, yog, c, ra, texts, as, a, true, definition, of, emptiness, according, to, walpola, rahula, the, thought, presented, in, the, yog, c, ra, school, s, abhidharma, samuccaya, is, undeniably, closer, to, that, of, the, pali, nikayas, than, is, that, of, the, theravadin, abhidhamma, both, the, m, dhyamikas, and, the, yog, c, rins, saw, themselves, as, preserving, the, buddhist, middle, way, between, the, extremes, of, nihilism, everything, as, unreal, and, substantialism, substantial, entities, existing, the, yog, c, rins, criticized, the, m, dhyamikas, for, tending, towards, nihilism, while, the, m, dhyamikas, criticized, the, yog, c, rins, for, tending, towards, substantialism, key, mah, y, na, texts, introducing, the, concepts, of, bodhicitta, and, buddha, nature, also, use, language, parallel, to, passages, in, the, canon, containing, the, buddha, s, description, of, luminous, mind, and, appear, to, have, evolved, from, this, idea, the, main, contemporary, traditions, of, mah, y, na, in, asia, are, there, are, also, some, minor, mah, y, na, traditions, practiced, by, minority, groups, such, as, newar, buddhism, practiced, by, the, newar, people, nepal, and, azhaliism, practiced, by, the, bai, people, yunnan, furthermore, there, are, also, various, new, religious, movements, which, either, see, themselves, as, mah, y, na, or, are, strongly, influenced, by, mah, y, na, buddhism, examples, of, these, include, h, a, h, o, won, buddhism, triratna, buddhist, community, and, s, ka, gakkai, lastly, there, are, various, east, asian, religious, traditions, which, are, strongly, influenced, by, mah, y, na, buddhism, though, they, may, not, be, considered, as, being, buddhist, per, se, these, include, bon, shugendo, mongolian, yellow, shamanism, syncretized, shinto, shinbutsu, sh, g, and, some, of, the, chinese, salvationist, religions, most, of, the, major, forms, of, contemporary, mah, y, na, buddhism, are, also, practiced, by, asian, immigrant, populations, in, the, west, and, also, by, western, convert, buddhists, for, more, on, this, topic, see, buddhism, in, the, west,

abhayagiri, vihara, in, sri, lanka, he, refers, to, the, monks, of, the, mah, vihara, as, the, h, nay, na, sthaviras, theras, and, the, monks, of, the, abhayagiri, vihara, as, the, mah, y, na, sthaviras, xuanzang, further, writes, the, mah, vih, rav, sins, reject, the, mah, y, na, and, practice, the, h, nay, na, while, the, abhayagirivih, rav, sins, study, both, h, nay, na, and, mah, y, na,

such, from, the, mah, y, na, perspective, their, view, is, based, on, a, different, understanding, of, the, concept, of, h, nay, na, rather, than, regarding, the, term, as, referring, to, any, school, of, buddhism, that, has, not, accepted, the, mah, y, na, canon, and, doctrines, such, as, those, pertaining, to, the, role, of, the, bodhisattva, these, authors, argue, that, the, classification, of, a, school, as, h, nay, na, should, be, crucially, dependent, on, the, adherence, to, a, specific, phenomenological, position, they, point, out, that, unlike, the, now, extinct, sarv, stiv, da, school, which, was, the, primary, object, of, mah, y, na, criticism, the, therav, da, does, not, claim, the, existence, of, independent, entities, dharmas, in, this, it, maintains, the, attitude, of, early, buddhism, adherents, of, mah, y, na, buddhism, disagreed, with, the, substantialist, thought, of, the, sarv, stiv, dins, and, sautr, ntikas, and, in, emphasizing, the, doctrine, of, emptiness, kalupahana, holds, that, they, endeavored, to, preserve, the, early, teaching, the, therav, dins, too, refuted, the, sarv, stiv, dins, and, sautr, ntikas, and, other, schools, on, the, grounds, that, their, theories, were, in, conflict, with, the, non, substantialism, of, the, canon, the, therav, da, arguments, are, preserved, in, the, kath, vatthu, some, contemporary, therav, din, figures, have, indicated, a, sympathetic, stance, toward, the, mah, y, na, philosophy, found, in, texts, such, as, the, heart, s, tra, skt, praj, p, ramit, h, daya, and, n, g, rjuna, s, fundamental, stanzas, on,
