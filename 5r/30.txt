plagiarism, is, the, representation, of, another, person, s, language, thoughts, ideas, or, expressions, as, one, s, own, original, work, although, precise, definitions, vary, depending, on, the, institution, in, many, countries, and, cultures, plagiarism, is, considered, a, violation, of, academic, integrity, and, journalistic, ethics, as, well, as, social, norms, around, learning, teaching, research, fairness, respect, and, responsibility, as, such, a, person, or, entity, that, is, determined, to, have, committed, plagiarism, is, often, subject, to, various, punishments, or, sanctions, such, as, suspension, expulsion, from, school, or, work, fines, imprisonment, and, other, penalties, plagiarism, is, typically, not, in, itself, a, crime, but, like, counterfeiting, fraud, can, be, punished, in, a, court, for, prejudices, caused, by, copyright, infringement, violation, of, moral, rights, or, torts, in, academia, and, in, industry, it, is, a, serious, ethical, offense, plagiarism, and, copyright, infringement, overlap, to, a, considerable, extent, but, they, are, not, equivalent, concepts, and, although, many, types, of, plagiarism, may, not, meet, the, legal, requirements, in, copyright, law, as, adjudicated, by, courts, they, still, constitute, the, passing, off, of, another, s, work, as, one, s, own, and, thus, plagiarism, not, all, cultures, and, countries, hold, the, same, beliefs, about, personal, ownership, of, language, or, ideas, in, some, cultures, the, reiteration, of, another, professional, s, work, can, be, a, sign, of, respect, or, flattery, towards, the, person, whose, work, is, reiterated, students, who, are, from, such, countries, and, cultures, and, who, move, to, the, united, states, or, other, western, countries, where, plagiarism, is, frowned, upon, may, find, the, transition, difficult, in, the, 1st, century, the, use, of, the, latin, word, plagiarius, literally, kidnapper, to, denote, copying, someone, else, s, creative, work, was, pioneered, by, the, roman, poet, martial, who, complained, that, another, poet, had, kidnapped, his, verses, plagiary, a, derivative, of, plagiarus, was, introduced, into, english, in, 1601, by, dramatist, ben, jonson, during, the, jacobean, era, to, describe, someone, guilty, of, literary, theft, the, derived, form, plagiarism, was, introduced, into, english, around, 1620, the, latin, words, plagi, rius, kidnapper, and, plagium, kidnapping, have, the, same, root, plaga, snare, net, which, is, based, on, the, indo, european, root, plak, to, weave, it, is, frequently, claimed, that, people, in, antiquity, had, no, concept, of, plagiarism, or, at, least, did, not, condemn, it, and, that, it, only, came, to, be, seen, as, immoral, much, later, anywhere, from, the, age, of, enlightenment, in, the, 17th, century, to, the, romantic, movement, in, the, 18th, century, although, people, in, antiquity, found, detecting, plagiarism, difficult, due, to, long, travel, times, and, scarcity, of, literate, persons, there, are, a, considerable, number, of, pre, enlightenment, authors, who, accused, others, of, plagiarism, and, considered, it, distasteful, and, scandalous, including, historians, polybius, and, pliny, the, elder, the, 3rd, century, greek, work, lives, of, the, eminent, philosophers, mentions, that, heraclides, ponticus, was, accused, of, plagiarizing, a, treatise, on, heliod, and, homer, in, vitruvius, s, 7th, book, he, acknowledged, his, debt, to, earlier, writers, and, attributed, them, and, he, also, included, a, strong, condemnation, of, plagiarism, earlier, writers, deserve, our, thanks, those, on, the, contrary, deserve, our, reproaches, who, steal, the, writings, of, such, men, and, publish, them, as, their, own, those, who, depend, in, their, writings, not, on, their, own, ideas, but, who, enviously, do, wrong, to, the, works, of, others, and, boast, of, it, deserve, not, merely, to, be, blamed, but, to, be, sentenced, to, actual, punishment, for, their, wicked, course, of, life, vitruvius, went, on, to, claim, that, such, things, did, not, pass, without, strict, chastisement, he, recounted, a, story, where, the, well, read, aristophanes, of, byzantium, judged, a, poetry, competition, and, caught, most, of, the, contestants, plagiarizing, others, poems, as, their, own, the, king, ordered, the, plagiarizers, to, confess, that, they, were, thieves, and, they, were, condemned, to, disgrace, although, the, story, may, be, apocryphal, it, shows, that, vitruvius, personally, considered, plagiarism, reprehensible, although, plagiarism, in, some, contexts, is, considered, theft, or, stealing, the, concept, does, not, exist, in, a, legal, sense, the, use, of, someone, else, s, work, in, order, to, gain, academic, credit, may, however, meet, some, legal, definitions, of, fraud, plagiarism, specifically, is, not, mentioned, in, any, current, statute, either, criminal, or, civil, some, cases, may, be, treated, as, unfair, competition, or, a, violation, of, the, doctrine, of, moral, rights, in, short, people, are, asked, to, use, the, guideline, if, you, did, not, write, it, yourself, you, must, give, credit, plagiarism, is, not, the, same, as, copyright, infringement, although, both, terms, may, apply, to, a, particular, act, they, are, different, concepts, and, false, claims, of, authorship, generally, constitute, plagiarism, regardless, of, whether, the, material, is, protected, by, copyright, copyright, infringement, is, a, violation, of, the, rights, of, a, copyright, holder, when, material, whose, use, is, restricted, by, copyright, is, used, without, consent, plagiarism, in, contrast, is, concerned, with, the, unearned, increment, to, the, plagiarizing, author, s, reputation, or, the, obtaining, of, academic, credit, that, is, achieved, through, false, claims, of, authorship, thus, plagiarism, is, considered, a, moral, offense, against, the, plagiarist, s, audience, for, example, a, reader, listener, or, teacher, plagiarism, is, also, considered, a, moral, offense, against, anyone, who, has, provided, the, plagiarist, with, a, benefit, in, exchange, for, what, is, specifically, supposed, to, be, original, content, for, example, the, plagiarist, s, publisher, employer, or, teacher, in, such, cases, acts, of, plagiarism, may, sometimes, also, form, part, of, a, claim, for, breach, of, the, plagiarist, s, contract, or, if, done, knowingly, for, a, civil, wrong, within, academia, plagiarism, by, students, professors, or, researchers, is, considered, academic, dishonesty, or, academic, fraud, and, offenders, are, subject, to, academic, censure, up, to, and, including, expulsion, for, students, and, termination, of, contracts, for, professors, and, researchers, some, institutions, use, plagiarism, detection, software, to, uncover, potential, plagiarism, and, to, deter, students, from, plagiarizing, however, plagiarism, detection, software, does, not, always, yield, accurate, results, and, there, are, loopholes, in, these, systems, some, universities, address, the, issue, of, academic, integrity, by, providing, students, with, thorough, orientation, including, required, writing, courses, and, clearly, articulated, honor, codes, indeed, there, is, a, virtually, uniform, understanding, among, college, students, that, plagiarism, is, wrong, nevertheless, each, year, a, number, of, students, are, brought, before, their, institutions, disciplinary, boards, on, charges, that, they, have, misused, sources, in, their, schoolwork, however, the, practice, of, plagiarizing, by, using, sufficient, word, substitutions, to, elude, detection, software, known, as, rogeting, has, rapidly, evolved, rogeting, is, an, informal, neologism, created, to, describe, the, act, of, modifying, a, published, source, by, substituting, synonyms, for, sufficient, words, to, fool, plagiarism, detection, software, often, resulting, in, the, creation, of, new, meaningless, phrases, through, extensive, synonym, swapping, the, term, a, reference, to, roget, s, thesaurus, coined, by, chris, sadler, principal, lecturer, in, business, information, systems, at, middlesex, university, who, uncovered, the, practice, in, papers, submitted, by, his, students, though, there, is, no, scholarly, evidence, of, rogeting, more, broadly, as, little, specific, research, has, been, conducted, another, form, of, plagiarism, known, as, contract, cheating, involves, students, paying, someone, else, such, as, an, essay, mill, to, do, their, work, for, them, as, of, 2021, few, parts, of, the, world, have, legislation, that, prohibits, the, operation, or, the, promotion, of, contract, cheating, services, because, it, is, predicated, upon, an, expected, level, of, learning, and, comprehension, having, been, achieved, all, associated, academic, accreditation, becomes, seriously, undermined, if, plagiarism, is, allowed, to, become, the, norm, within, academic, submissions, for, professors, and, researchers, plagiarism, is, punished, by, sanctions, ranging, from, suspension, to, termination, along, with, the, loss, of, credibility, and, perceived, integrity, charges, of, plagiarism, against, students, and, professors, are, typically, heard, by, internal, disciplinary, committees, by, which, students, and, professors, have, agreed, to, be, bound, plagiarism, is, a, common, reason, for, academic, research, papers, to, be, retracted, library, science, is, developing, approaches, to, address, the, issue, of, plagiarism, at, institutional, levels, scholars, of, plagiarism, include, rebecca, moore, howard, susan, blum, tracey, bretag, and, sarah, elaine, eaton, there, is, a, moral, implication, to, plagiarism, in, that, it, takes, for, granted, other, people, s, time, work, and, effort, this, deontological, scrutiny, of, plagiarism, is, important, to, the, debate, on, the, ethics, of, plagiarism, doctor, amy, robillard, poses, the, metaphor, that, plagiarism, is, theft, and, believes, that, the, ethics, of, that, statement, are, important, for, schooling, and, academia, work, that, has, been, plagiarized, could, be, considered, intellectual, property, and, so, to, plagiarize, would, constitute, copyright, or, intellectual, property, infringement, however, some, consider, plagiarism, to, have, a, deeper, context, in, which, writings, are, to, be, considered, property, and, hence, a, work, s, unlawful, usage, by, plagiarists, would, constitute, theft, and, has, ethical, implications, in, academia, and, elsewhere, no, universally, adopted, definition, of, academic, plagiarism, exists, however, this, section, provides, several, definitions, to, exemplify, the, most, common, characteristics, of, academic, plagiarism, it, has, been, called, the, use, of, ideas, concepts, words, or, structures, without, appropriately, acknowledging, the, source, to, benefit, in, a, setting, where, originality, is, expected, this, is, an, abridged, version, of, teddi, fishman, s, definition, of, plagiarism, which, proposed, five, elements, characteristic, of, plagiarism, according, to, fishman, plagiarism, occurs, when, someone, furthermore, plagiarism, is, defined, differently, among, institutions, of, higher, learning, and, universities, different, classifications, of, academic, plagiarism, forms, have, been, proposed, many, classifications, follow, a, behavioral, approach, by, seeking, to, classify, the, actions, undertaken, by, plagiarists, for, example, a, 2015, survey, of, teachers, and, professors, by, turnitin, identified, 10, main, forms, of, plagiarism, that, students, commit, the, authors, of, a, 2019, systematic, literature, review, on, academic, plagiarism, detection, derived, a, four, leven, typology, of, academic, plagiarism, from, the, total, words, of, a, language, lexis, from, its, syntax, from, its, semantics, and, from, methods, to, capture, plagiarism, of, ideas, and, structures, the, typology, categorizes, plagiarism, forms, according, to, the, layer, of, the, model, they, affect, several, studies, investigated, factors, predicting, the, decision, to, plagiarize, for, example, a, panel, study, with, students, from, german, universities, found, that, academic, procrastination, predicts, the, frequency, plagiarism, conducted, within, six, months, followed, the, measurement, of, academic, procrastination, it, has, been, argued, that, by, plagiarizing, students, cope, with, the, negative, consequences, that, result, from, academic, procrastination, such, as, poor, grades, another, study, found, that, plagiarism, is, more, frequent, if, students, perceive, plagiarism, as, beneficial, and, if, they, have, the, opportunity, to, plagiarize, when, students, had, expected, higher, sanctions, and, when, they, had, internalized, social, norms, that, define, plagiarism, as, very, objectionable, plagiarism, was, less, likely, to, occur, another, study, found, that, students, resorted, to, plagiarism, in, order, to, cope, with, heavy, workloads, imposed, by, teachers, on, the, other, hand, in, that, study, some, teachers, also, thought, that, plagiarism, is, a, consequence, of, their, own, failure, to, propose, creative, tasks, and, activities, in, the, academic, world, plagiarism, by, students, is, usually, considered, a, very, serious, offense, that, can, result, in, punishments, such, as, a, failing, grade, on, the, particular, assignment, the, entire, course, or, even, being, expelled, from, the, institution, the, seriousness, with, which, academic, institutions, address, student, plagiarism, may, be, tempered, by, a, recognition, that, students, may, not, fully, understand, what, plagiarism, is, a, 2015, study, showed, that, students, who, were, new, to, university, study, did, not, have, a, good, understanding, of, even, the, basic, requirements, of, how, to, attribute, sources, in, written, academic, work, yet, students, were, very, confident, that, they, understood, what, referencing, and, plagiarism, are, the, same, students, also, had, a, lenient, view, of, how, plagiarism, should, be, penalised, for, cases, of, repeated, plagiarism, or, for, cases, in, which, a, student, commits, severe, plagiarism, e, g, purchasing, an, assignment, suspension, or, expulsion, may, occur, there, has, been, historic, concern, about, inconsistencies, in, penalties, administered, for, university, student, plagiarism, and, a, plagiarism, tariff, was, devised, in, 2008, for, uk, higher, education, institutions, in, an, attempt, to, encourage, some, standardization, of, approaches, expanding, accessibility, and, usage, of, the, internet, has, a, positive, correlation, with, plagiarism, however, a, croatian, study, found, that, students, were, not, more, likely, to, plagiarize, when, using, an, electronic, writing, medium, easy, access, to, information, has, made, it, much, simpler, for, students, to, copy, and, paste, information, from, the, internet, without, crediting, the, original, author, educational, institutions, often, emphasize, the, importance, of, originality, proper, citation, and, academic, integrity, to, combat, plagiarism, they, implement, policies, educational, programs, and, tools, like, plagiarism, detection, software, to, discourage, and, detect, instances, of, plagiarism, a, 2012, survey, of, u, s, high, schools, found, 32, of, students, admitted, to, copying, an, assignment, from, the, internet, strategies, faculty, members, use, to, detect, plagiarism, include, carefully, reading, students, work, and, making, note, of, inconsistencies, in, student, writing, and, of, citation, errors, and, providing, plagiarism, prevention, education, to, students, it, has, been, found, that, a, significant, share, of, university, instructors, do, not, use, detection, methods, such, as, using, text, matching, software, a, few, more, try, to, detect, plagiarism, by, reading, term, papers, specifically, for, plagiarism, although, the, latter, method, might, be, not, very, effective, in, detecting, plagiarism, especially, when, plagiarism, from, unfamiliar, sources, needs, to, be, detected, there, are, checklists, of, tactics, to, prevent, student, plagiarism, turnitin, an, internet, based, plagiarism, detection, service, emerged, as, a, digital, platform, in, 1995, and, quickly, dominated, the, market, turnitin, serves, more, than, 30, million, students, worldwide, across, over, 10, 000, institutions, in, 135, countries, and, has, been, utilized, by, over, 1, 6, million, instructors, when, evaluating, an, article, turnitin, provides, both, formative, and, summative, assessments, the, formative, assessment, provides, instructors, with, a, basic, evaluation, of, the, student, s, level, of, achievement, while, the, summative, assessment, is, the, final, evaluative, judgment, of, the, writing, turnitin, utilizes, artificial, intelligence, to, evaluate, writing, through, the, use, of, cutting, edge, adaptive, technology, the, turnitin, scoring, engine, webpage, outlines, the, rationale, behind, this, technology, which, mainly, focuses, on, analyzing, patterns, in, previously, evaluated, essays, by, providing, sample, essays, the, engine, can, accurately, rate, papers, in, just, a, few, minutes, it, assesses, the, readability, of, content, and, the, writer, s, familiarity, with, the, genre, based, on, a, comprehensive, evaluation, of, word, usage, genre, conventions, and, sentence, structure, the, final, report, page, highlights, sentences, of, plagiarism, so, that, instructors, can, easily, identify, the, corresponding, content, despite, its, technological, advancements, turnitin, has, some, limitations, a, croatian, study, found, that, small, language, languages, with, less, of, a, digital, footprint, written, material, is, not, supported, by, the, larger, base, of, plagiarism, detection, tools, and, that, languages, with, more, of, a, digital, footprint, and, more, outreach, tend, to, be, better, supported, the, generation, of, reports, by, turnitin, which, involves, comparing, and, scoring, vast, amounts, of, student, work, can, potentially, infringe, on, copyright, laws, turnitin, monitors, students, to, ensure, that, their, work, is, original, and, unique, with, this, validation, process, being, carried, out, by, a, supervising, machine, however, this, practice, can, result, in, unrestricted, access, to, student, data, for, teachers, institutions, and, governments, and, lead, to, severe, copyright, infringement, issues, furthermore, plagiarism, detection, systems, pds, especially, when, used, for, grading, purposes, have, certain, drawbacks, while, turnitin, can, identify, matching, texts, it, does, not, provide, a, clear, definition, of, plagiarism, leaving, potential, disputes, for, individual, interpretation, for, example, different, instructors, may, interpret, the, same, report, with, varying, explanations, the, extent, of, plagiarism, can, vary, significantly, ranging, from, a, single, paragraph, to, multiple, instances, within, a, five, to, six, page, paper, without, a, rigorous, standard, that, defines, plagiarism, instructors, defining, plagiarism, based, on, their, own, understanding, can, lead, to, confusion, and, conflicts, though, widely, employed, in, high, schools, and, universities, plagiarism, detection, tools, create, a, delicate, environment, in, the, classroom, as, they, place, instructors, in, the, role, of, guardians, of, ethical, principles, establishing, an, adversarial, relationship, between, teachers, and, students, these, tools, presuppose, that, students, are, prone, to, plagiarizing, and, that, instructors, should, use, advanced, techniques, to, uncover, it, such, scrutiny, can, cause, students, to, feel, afraid, and, disempowered, as, they, may, consider, these, tools, as, omnipotent, monitors, the, writecheck, reviews, demonstrate, that, students, may, be, afraid, of, being, caught, leading, to, writing, with, pressure, and, anxiety, these, reviews, highlight, the, power, dynamics, and, the, culture, of, fear, around, plagiarism, in, the, classroom, additionally, inherent, power, imbalances, between, instructors, and, students, exist, since, students, may, feel, obligated, to, submit, their, work, to, turnitin, for, evaluation, furthermore, turnitin, endeavors, to, promote, western, writing, values, globally, it, inherently, promotes, standardized, writing, around, the, world, advancing, western, ideas, of, authorship, and, eae, which, reinforce, harmful, ideologies, that, impact, writing, instructors, in, general, plagiarism, detection, systems, deter, rather, than, detect, plagiarism, but, they, do, not, reflect, the, ultimate, educational, objectives, given, the, serious, consequences, that, plagiarism, has, for, students, there, has, been, a, call, for, a, greater, emphasis, on, learning, in, order, to, help, students, avoid, committing, plagiarism, this, is, especially, important, when, students, move, to, a, new, institution, that, may, have, a, different, view, of, the, concept, when, compared, with, the, view, previously, developed, by, the, student, indeed, given, the, seriousness, of, plagiarism, accusations, for, a, student, s, future, the, pedagogy, of, plagiarism, education, may, need, to, be, considered, ahead, of, the, pedagogy, of, the, discipline, being, studied, the, need, for, plagiarism, education, extends, to, academic, staff, who, may, not, completely, understand, what, is, expected, of, their, students, or, the, consequences, of, misconduct, actions, to, reduce, plagiarism, include, coordinating, teaching, activities, to, decrease, student, load, reducing, memorization, increasing, individual, practical, activities, and, promoting, positive, reinforcement, over, punishment, a, student, may, opt, to, plagiarize, due, to, a, lack, of, research, methods, knowledge, of, citation, practices, or, an, excessive, workload, to, eventually, reduce, plagiarism, students, should, be, educated, about, the, ethical, and, legal, concerns, surrounding, these, tools, and, teachers, should, devise, suitable, and, innovative, assignments, that, require, more, independent, thinking, many, scholars, and, members, of, academia, have, taken, a, negative, position, on, the, use, of, plagiarism, detection, technologies, arguing, that, its, use, promotes, a, culture, of, surveillance, and, conformity, in, higher, education, many, have, called, for, a, reevaluation, of, higher, learning, away, from, a, focus, on, grades, and, credentials, towards, a, more, holistic, approach, one, such, recommendation, outlined, by, scholars, is, to, turn, students, towards, revision, as, opposed, to, plagiarism, detection, this, updated, focus, has, culminated, in, the, creation, of, sites, such, as, eli, review, which, is, intended, to, facilitate, improved, writing, through, peer, review, educators, have, recognized, the, need, for, careful, consideration, when, implementing, plagiarism, detection, software, in, order, to, balance, the, promotion, of, academic, integrity, with, maintaining, a, positive, learning, environment, this, balancing, act, has, been, at, the, center, of, the, pushback, against, traditional, plagiarism, detection, systems, as, educators, have, become, increasingly, aware, of, the, potential, negative, impact, of, such, technology, on, trust, and, privacy, this, emphasis, on, striking, a, balance, between, these, competing, interests, highlights, the, importance, of, thoughtful, and, nuanced, approaches, to, addressing, plagiarism, in, the, academic, context, a, study, showed, that, students, warned, about, plagiarism, and, its, penalties, were, less, likely, to, plagiarize, also, in, that, study, students, who, were, intentionally, avoiding, plagiarism, wrote, less, on, average, which, was, suspected, to, lead, to, reduced, quality, of, work, to, minimize, plagiarism, in, the, digital, era, it, is, crucial, that, students, understand, the, definition, of, plagiarism, and, how, important, intellectual, property, rights, are, students, should, be, aware, that, correct, attribution, is, required, to, prevent, the, accusation, of, plagiarism, and, that, the, ethical, and, legal, rules, that, apply, to, printed, materials, also, apply, to, electronic, information, in, journalism, plagiarism, is, considered, a, breach, of, journalistic, ethics, and, reporters, caught, plagiarizing, typically, face, disciplinary, measures, ranging, from, suspension, to, termination, of, employment, some, individuals, caught, plagiarizing, in, academic, or, journalistic, contexts, claim, that, they, plagiarized, unintentionally, by, failing, to, include, quotations, or, to, give, the, appropriate, citation, although, plagiarism, in, scholarship, and, journalism, has, a, centuries, old, history, the, development, of, the, internet, where, articles, appear, as, electronic, text, has, made, the, physical, act, of, copying, the, work, of, others, much, easier, because, journalism, relies, on, the, public, trust, a, reporter, s, failure, to, acknowledge, sources, honestly, undercuts, a, newspaper, or, television, news, show, s, integrity, and, undermines, its, credibility, journalists, accused, of, plagiarism, are, often, suspended, from, their, reporting, tasks, while, the, charges, are, being, investigated, by, the, news, organization, through, all, of, the, history, of, literature, and, of, the, arts, in, general, works, of, art, are, to, a, large, extent, repetitions, of, the, tradition, to, the, entire, history, of, artistic, creativity, belong, plagiarism, literary, theft, appropriation, incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, thematic, variation, ironic, retake, parody, imitation, stylistic, theft, pastiches, collages, and, deliberate, assemblages, there, is, no, rigorous, and, precise, distinction, between, practices, like, imitation, stylistic, plagiarism, copy, replica, and, forgery, these, appropriation, procedures, are, the, main, axis, of, a, literate, culture, in, which, the, tradition, of, the, canonic, past, is, being, constantly, rewritten, publishing, another, s, art, as, one, s, own, is, sometimes, called, art, theft, particularly, online, this, usage, has, little, direct, relationship, to, the, theft, of, physical, works, of, art, ruth, graham, quotes, t, s, eliot, immature, poets, imitate, mature, poets, steal, bad, poets, deface, what, they, take, she, notes, that, despite, the, taboo, of, plagiarism, the, ill, will, and, embarrassment, it, causes, in, the, modern, context, readers, seem, to, often, forgive, the, past, excesses, of, historic, literary, offenders, a, passage, of, laurence, sterne, s, 1767, tristram, shandy, condemns, plagiarism, by, resorting, to, plagiarism, oliver, goldsmith, commented, sterne, s, writings, in, which, it, is, clearly, shewn, that, he, whose, manner, and, style, were, so, long, thought, original, was, in, fact, the, most, unhesitating, plagiarist, who, ever, cribbed, from, his, predecessors, in, order, to, garnish, his, own, pages, it, must, be, owned, at, the, same, time, that, sterne, selects, the, materials, of, his, mosaic, work, with, so, much, art, places, them, so, well, and, polishes, them, so, highly, that, in, most, cases, we, are, disposed, to, pardon, the, want, of, originality, in, consideration, of, the, exquisite, talent, with, which, the, borrowed, materials, are, wrought, up, into, the, new, form, a, common, turn, of, phrase, variously, attributed, to, william, faulkner, pablo, picasso, t, s, eliot, and, steve, jobs, among, others, claims, that, good, artists, copy, great, artists, steal, though, this, phrase, appears, to, be, praising, artistic, plagiarism, it, is, more, commonly, taken, to, refer, to, constructively, iterating, upon, the, work, of, others, and, being, transparent, about, one, s, influences, the, reuse, of, significant, identical, or, nearly, identical, portions, of, one, s, own, work, without, acknowledging, that, one, is, doing, so, or, citing, the, original, work, is, sometimes, described, as, self, plagiarism, the, term, recycling, fraud, has, also, been, used, to, describe, this, practice, articles, of, this, nature, are, often, referred, to, as, duplicate, or, multiple, publication, in, addition, there, can, be, a, copyright, issue, if, copyright, of, the, prior, work, has, been, transferred, to, another, entity, self, plagiarism, is, considered, a, serious, ethical, issue, in, settings, where, someone, asserts, that, a, publication, consists, of, new, material, such, as, in, publishing, or, factual, documentation, it, does, not, apply, to, public, interest, texts, such, as, social, professional, and, cultural, opinions, usually, published, in, newspapers, and, magazines, in, academic, fields, self, plagiarism, occurs, when, authors, reuse, portions, of, their, own, published, and, copyrighted, work, in, subsequent, publications, but, without, attributing, the, previous, publication, identifying, self, plagiarism, is, often, difficult, because, limited, reuse, of, material, is, accepted, both, legally, as, fair, use, and, ethically, many, people, mostly, but, not, limited, to, critics, of, copyright, and, intellectual, property, do, not, believe, it, is, possible, to, plagiarize, oneself, critics, of, the, concepts, of, plagiarism, and, copyright, may, use, the, idea, of, self, plagiarism, as, a, reductio, ad, absurdum, argument, miguel, roig, has, written, at, length, about, the, topic, of, self, plagiarism, and, his, definition, of, self, plagiarism, as, using, previously, disseminated, work, is, widely, accepted, among, scholars, of, the, topic, however, the, term, self, plagiarism, has, been, challenged, as, being, self, contradictory, an, oxymoron, and, on, other, grounds, for, example, stephanie, j, bird, argues, that, self, plagiarism, is, a, misnomer, since, by, definition, plagiarism, concerns, the, use, of, others, material, bird, identifies, the, ethical, issues, of, self, plagiarism, as, those, of, dual, or, redundant, publication, she, also, notes, that, in, an, educational, context, self, plagiarism, refers, to, the, case, of, a, student, who, resubmits, the, same, essay, for, credit, in, two, different, courses, as, david, b, resnik, clarifies, self, plagiarism, involves, dishonesty, but, not, intellectual, theft, according, to, patrick, m, scanlon, self, plagiarism, is, a, term, with, some, specialized, currency, most, prominently, it, is, used, in, discussions, of, research, and, publishing, integrity, in, biomedicine, where, heavy, publish, or, perish, demands, have, led, to, a, rash, of, duplicate, and, salami, slicing, publication, the, reporting, of, a, single, study, s, results, in, least, publishable, units, within, multiple, articles, blancett, flanagin, young, 1995, jefferson, 1998, kassirer, angell, 1995, lowe, 2003, mccarthy, 1993, schein, paladugu, 2001, wheeler, 1989, roig, 2002, has, offered, a, useful, classification, system, including, four, types, of, self, plagiarism, duplicate, publication, of, an, article, in, more, than, one, journal, partitioning, of, one, study, into, multiple, publications, often, called, salami, slicing, text, recycling, and, copyright, infringement, some, academic, journals, have, codes, of, ethics, that, specifically, refer, to, self, plagiarism, e, g, the, journal, of, international, business, studies, some, professional, organizations, such, as, the, association, for, computing, machinery, acm, have, created, policies, that, deal, specifically, with, self, plagiarism, other, organizations, do, not, make, specific, reference, to, self, plagiarism, such, as, the, american, political, science, association, apsa, the, organization, published, a, code, of, ethics, that, describes, plagiarism, as, deliberate, appropriation, of, the, works, of, others, represented, as, one, s, own, it, does, not, make, any, reference, to, self, plagiarism, it, does, say, that, when, a, thesis, or, dissertation, is, published, in, whole, or, in, part, the, author, is, not, ordinarily, under, an, ethical, obligation, to, acknowledge, its, origins, the, american, society, for, public, administration, aspa, also, published, a, code, of, ethics, that, says, its, members, are, committed, to, ensure, that, others, receive, credit, for, their, work, and, contributions, but, it, makes, no, reference, to, self, plagiarism, pamela, samuelson, in, 1994, identified, several, factors, she, says, excuse, reuse, of, one, s, previously, published, work, that, make, it, not, self, plagiarism, she, relates, each, of, these, factors, specifically, to, the, ethical, issue, of, self, plagiarism, as, distinct, from, the, legal, issue, of, fair, use, of, copyright, which, she, deals, with, separately, among, other, factors, that, may, excuse, reuse, of, previously, published, material, samuelson, lists, the, following, samuelson, states, she, has, relied, on, the, different, audience, rationale, when, attempting, to, bridge, interdisciplinary, communities, she, refers, to, writing, for, different, legal, and, technical, communities, saying, there, are, often, paragraphs, or, sequences, of, paragraphs, that, can, be, bodily, lifted, from, one, article, to, the, other, and, in, truth, i, lift, them, she, refers, to, her, own, practice, of, converting, a, technical, article, into, a, law, review, article, with, relatively, few, changes, adding, footnotes, and, one, substantive, section, for, a, different, audience, samuelson, describes, misrepresentation, as, the, basis, of, self, plagiarism, she, also, states, although, it, seems, not, to, have, been, raised, in, any, of, the, self, plagiarism, cases, copyrights, law, s, fair, use, defense, would, likely, provide, a, shield, against, many, potential, publisher, claims, of, copyright, infringement, against, authors, who, reused, portions, of, their, previous, works, plagiarism, is, presumably, not, an, issue, when, organizations, issue, collective, unsigned, works, since, they, do, not, assign, credit, for, originality, to, particular, people, for, example, the, american, historical, association, s, statement, on, standards, of, professional, conduct, 2005, regarding, textbooks, and, reference, books, stated, that, because, textbooks, and, encyclopedias, are, summaries, of, other, scholars, work, they, are, not, bound, by, the, same, exacting, standards, of, attribution, as, original, research, and, may, be, allowed, a, greater, extent, of, dependence, on, other, works, however, even, such, a, book, does, not, make, use, of, words, phrases, or, paragraphs, from, another, text, or, follow, too, closely, the, other, text, s, arrangement, and, organization, and, the, authors, of, such, texts, are, also, expected, to, acknowledge, the, sources, of, recent, or, distinctive, findings, and, interpretations, those, not, yet, a, part, of, the, common, understanding, of, the, profession, reverse, plagiarism, or, attribution, without, copying, refers, to, falsely, giving, authorship, credit, over, a, work, to, a, person, who, did, not, author, it, or, falsely, claiming, a, source, supports, an, assertion, that, the, source, does, not, make, although, both, the, term, and, activity, are, relatively, rare, incidents, of, reverse, plagiarism, do, occur, typically, in, similar, contexts, as, traditional, plagiarism, the, increase, in, plagiarism, can, also, be, attributed, to, developments, in, artificial, intelligence, the, emergence, of, large, language, models, llms, such, as, gpt, 3, and, chatgpt, raised, global, discussion, about, the, impact, of, artificial, intelligence, on, writing, and, plagiarism, one, such, innovation, is, the, gpt, 2, model, which, is, capable, of, generating, coherent, paragraphs, and, achieving, high, scores, on, various, language, modeling, assessments, it, can, also, perform, basic, tasks, such, as, reading, comprehension, machine, translation, question, answering, and, summarization, currently, detectors, of, ai, language, such, as, gptzero, have, been, introduced, to, cope, with, this, problem, noam, chomsky, called, chatgpt, nothing, more, than, high, tech, plagiarism, in, contrast, others, have, proposed, that, the, essay, is, dead, declaring, that, artificial, intelligence, will, transform, academia, and, society, one, scholar, of, plagiarism, eaton, proposed, the, idea, of, a, postplagiarism, era, in, which, human, and, artificial, intelligence, hybrid, writing, become, normal, the, impact, of, artificial, intelligence, on, plagiarism, has, yet, to, be, fully, understood, the, widespread, use, of, artificial, intelligence, brings, a, lot, of, troubles, to, colleges, with, chatgpt, s, strong, database, and, convenience, students, who, see, much, of, the, work, assigned, by, professors, as, just, busy, work, will, complete, the, work, via, artificial, intelligence, however, instead, of, banning, the, use, of, chatgpt, in, academic, study, some, have, suggested, that, professors, use, tools, like, chatgpt, in, their, teaching, to, create, outlines, individualized, lesson, plans, and, ideas, for, classroom, activities, use, or, close, imitation, of, the, language, and, thoughts, of, another, author, and, the, representation, of, them, as, one, s, own, original, work, the, action, or, practice, of, taking, someone, else, s, work, idea, etc, and, passing, it, off, as, one, s, own, literary, theft, each, of, the, types, of, repetition, that, we, have, examined, is, not, limited, to, the, mass, media, but, belongs, by, right, to, the, entire, history, of, artistic, creativity, plagiarism, quotation, parody, the, ironic, retake, are, typical, of, the, entire, artistic, literary, tradition, much, art, has, been, and, is, repetitive, the, concept, of, absolute, originality, is, a, contemporary, one, born, with, romanticism, classical, art, was, in, vast, measure, serial, and, the, modern, avant, garde, at, the, beginning, of, this, century, challenged, the, romantic, idea, of, creation, from, nothingness, with, its, techniques, of, collage, mustachios, on, the, mona, lisa, art, about, art, and, so, on, transposition, all, the, other, possible, terms, rewriting, rehandling, remake, revision, refection, recasting, etc, p, 437, there, is, between, translation, proper, and, transmutation, a, vast, terrain, of, partial, transformation, the, verbal, signs, in, the, original, message, or, statement, are, modified, by, one, of, a, multitude, of, means, or, by, a, combination, of, means, these, include, paraphrase, graphic, illustration, pastiche, imitation, thematic, variation, parody, citation, in, a, supporting, or, undermining, context, false, attribution, accidental, or, deliberate, plagiarism, collage, and, many, others, this, zone, of, partial, transformation, of, derivation, of, alternate, restatement, determines, much, of, our, sensibility, and, literacy, it, is, quite, simply, the, matrix, of, culture, p, 459, we, could, in, some, measure, at, least, come, closer, to, a, verifiable, gradation, of, the, sequence, of, techniques, and, aims, which, leads, from, literal, translation, through, paraphrases, mimesis, and, pastiche, to, thematic, variation, i, have, suggested, that, this, sequence, is, the, main, axis, of, a, literate, culture, that, a, culture, advances, spiralwise, via, translations, of, its, own, canonic, past
