the, kojiki, records, of, ancient, matters, or, an, account, of, ancient, matters, also, sometimes, read, as, furukotofumi, or, furukotobumi, is, an, early, japanese, chronicle, of, myths, legends, hymns, genealogies, oral, traditions, and, semi, historical, accounts, down, to, 641, concerning, the, origin, of, the, japanese, archipelago, the, kami, and, the, japanese, imperial, line, it, is, claimed, in, its, preface, to, have, been, composed, by, no, yasumaro, at, the, request, of, empress, genmei, in, the, early, 8th, century, 711, 712, and, thus, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, oldest, extant, literary, work, in, japan, the, myths, contained, in, the, kojiki, as, well, as, the, nihon, shoki, are, part, of, the, inspiration, behind, many, practices, and, unified, shinto, orthodoxy, later, they, were, incorporated, into, shinto, practices, such, as, the, misogi, purification, ritual, it, is, believed, that, the, compilation, of, various, genealogical, and, anecdotal, histories, of, the, imperial, yamato, court, and, prominent, clans, began, during, the, reigns, of, emperors, keitai, and, kinmei, in, the, 6th, century, with, the, first, concerted, effort, at, historical, compilation, of, which, we, have, record, being, the, one, made, in, 620, under, the, auspices, of, prince, shotoku, and, soga, no, umako, according, to, the, nihon, shoki, the, documents, compiled, under, their, initiative, were, the, tenn, ki, also, sumera, mikoto, no, fumi, or, the, record, of, the, emperors, the, kokki, also, kunitsufumi, or, the, national, record, and, other, fundamental, records, hongi, or, mototsufumi, pertaining, to, influential, clans, and, free, subjects, out, of, these, texts, only, the, kokki, survived, the, burning, of, soga, no, emishi, s, estate, where, these, documents, were, kept, during, the, isshi, incident, of, 645, and, was, itself, apparently, lost, soon, after, the, kojiki, s, preface, indicates, that, leading, families, also, kept, their, own, historical, and, genealogical, records, indeed, one, of, the, reasons, it, gives, for, the, compilation, of, the, kojiki, is, the, correction, of, errors, that, had, supposedly, crept, into, these, documents, according, to, the, preface, emperor, tenmu, reigned, 673, 686, ordered, the, review, and, emendation, of, clan, documents, and, commissioned, a, certain, court, attendant, toneri, of, exceptional, memory, named, hieda, no, are, to, memorize, records, and, oral, traditions, concerning, the, imperial, lineage, beyond, this, memorization, nothing, occurred, until, the, reign, of, empress, genmei, reigned, 707, 715, who, on, the, 18th, of, the, 9th, month, of, 711, wad, 4, ordered, the, courtier, no, yasumaro, to, record, what, had, been, learned, by, hieda, no, are, he, finished, and, presented, his, work, to, empress, genmei, on, the, 28th, of, the, 1st, month, of, 712, wad, 5, the, kojiki, is, a, collation, of, different, traditions, woven, into, a, single, official, mythology, made, in, an, attempt, to, justify, the, rule, of, the, imperial, yamato, polity, and, at, the, same, time, to, subsume, different, interest, groups, under, its, wing, by, giving, them, a, place, and, an, interest, in, the, national, genealogy, mythology, apart, from, furthering, the, imperial, agenda, an, increased, interest, in, the, nation, s, origins, in, reaction, to, the, influx, of, foreign, culture, and, the, need, for, an, authoritative, genealogical, account, by, which, to, consider, the, claims, of, noble, families, and, to, reorganize, them, into, a, new, system, of, ranks, and, titles, are, also, possible, factors, for, its, compilation, the, kojiki, s, narrative, establishes, the, yamato, line, s, right, to, rule, via, myth, and, legend, portraying, it, as, the, progeny, of, heavenly, deities, and, the, rightful, heir, to, the, land, of, japan, a, good, part, of, the, latter, portion, of, the, text, is, spent, recounting, various, genealogies, which, served, not, only, to, give, the, imperial, family, an, air, of, antiquity, which, may, not, necessarily, reflect, historical, reality, but, also, served, to, tie, whether, true, or, not, many, existing, clans, genealogies, to, their, own, regardless, of, the, work, s, original, intent, it, finalized, and, possibly, even, formulated, the, framework, by, which, japanese, history, was, examined, in, terms, of, the, reign, of, emperors, in, contrast, to, the, nihon, shoki, compiled, 720, the, first, of, six, histories, commissioned, by, the, imperial, court, which, was, modeled, on, chinese, dynastic, histories, and, was, intended, to, be, a, national, chronicle, that, could, be, shown, with, pride, to, foreign, envoys, the, kojiki, is, inward, looking, concerned, mainly, with, the, ruling, family, and, prominent, clans, and, is, apparently, intended, for, internal, consumption, whereas, the, nihon, shoki, uses, a, variety, of, source, documents, including, chinese, texts, the, kojiki, is, apparently, based, on, sources, handed, down, within, the, court, whereas, the, nihon, shoki, owing, to, its, status, as, one, of, the, six, imperial, histories, was, widely, read, and, studied, during, the, heian, period, 794, 1185, the, kojiki, was, mostly, treated, as, an, ancillary, text, indeed, a, work, known, as, the, sendai, kuji, hongi, also, known, as, the, kujiki, claimed, to, have, been, authored, by, prince, sh, toku, and, soga, no, umako, was, considered, to, be, earlier, and, more, reliable, than, the, kojiki, modern, scholarly, consensus, holds, the, kuji, hongi, to, be, a, heian, period, forgery, based, on, both, the, kojiki, and, the, shoki, although, certain, portions, may, indeed, preserve, genuine, early, traditions, and, sources, by, the, kamakura, period, 1185, 1333, the, work, languished, in, obscurity, such, that, very, few, people, had, access, to, the, text, particularly, that, of, the, middle, second, volume, it, is, due, to, this, neglect, that, the, kojiki, is, available, only, in, comparatively, late, manuscripts, the, earliest, of, which, dates, to, the, late, 14th, century, it, was, with, the, advent, of, printing, in, the, early, modern, period, that, the, kojiki, first, reached, a, wide, audience, the, earliest, printed, edition, of, the, text, was, the, kan, ei, kojiki, published, in, kyoto, in, 1644, kan, ei, 21, a, second, edition, the, g, t, kojiki, kojiki, with, marginal, notes, was, printed, by, deguchi, watarai, nobuyoshi, a, priest, at, ise, shrine, in, 1687, j, ky, 4, the, birth, of, nativist, studies, kokugaku, and, nationalist, sentiment, during, the, edo, period, saw, a, reappraisal, of, the, kojiki, kokugaku, scholars, saw, japan, s, earliest, writings, as, the, repository, of, a, uniquely, superior, japanese, identity, that, could, be, revived, by, recovering, the, ancient, language, they, were, written, in, the, kojiki, by, virtue, of, its, antiquity, gained, the, status, of, a, sacred, text, the, kojiki, came, to, be, highly, regarded, that, scholars, such, as, kada, no, azumamaro, and, kamo, no, mabuchi, himself, a, student, of, azumamaro, produced, annotated, versions, of, it, the, kojiki, received, its, most, serious, study, and, exposition, in, the, hands, of, motoori, norinaga, who, obtained, a, copy, of, the, kan, ei, printed, edition, in, 1754, after, meeting, mabuchi, in, 1763, norinaga, began, to, devote, his, efforts, to, an, in, depth, scholarly, study, of, the, text, a, monumental, 44, volume, study, of, the, kojiki, called, kojiki, den, commentary, on, the, kojiki, composed, over, a, 34, year, period, 1764, 1798, was, the, fruit, of, his, labor, with, norinaga, the, kojiki, assumed, an, importance, equal, to, the, nihon, shoki, in, fact, in, his, view, the, kojiki, was, a, more, trustworthy, source, for, ancient, japanese, traditions, than, was, the, shoki, precisely, because, it, was, free, of, chinese, mentality, he, viewed, the, kojiki, as, a, true, account, of, actual, events, that, when, read, correctly, could, reveal, japan, in, its, pristine, ideal, state, as, a, community, where, the, kami, the, emperor, and, the, people, lived, in, harmony, norinaga, s, work, was, carried, on, in, different, directions, by, his, disciple, hirata, atsutane, and, his, rivals, fujitani, mitsue, 1781, 1849, and, tachibana, moribe, 1768, 1823, who, each, produced, commentaries, and, treatises, on, the, text, the, kojiki, became, once, more, the, object, of, scholarly, focus, and, discussion, in, the, meiji, period, with, the, introduction, of, western, academic, disciplines, such, as, philology, and, comparative, mythology, the, importance, of, the, text, as, a, work, of, literary, value, was, recognized, and, scholars, realized, that, its, accounts, were, comparable, in, many, ways, to, ancient, greek, and, roman, myths, at, the, same, time, however, the, kojiki, and, nihon, shoki, achieved, a, sort, of, scriptural, status, under, state, shint, which, viewed, the, stories, contained, therein, as, orthodox, national, history, official, ideology, upheld, as, unquestionable, fact, the, belief, in, the, emperor, s, divinity, and, the, idea, of, japan, as, a, racially, superior, national, body, kokutai, with, scholars, who, questioned, their, veracity, facing, the, threat, of, censorship, forced, resignation, or, even, trial, in, court, until, the, meiji, era, the, text, s, sacred, nature, was, not, known, to, have, been, questioned, however, the, kojiki, was, still, widely, seen, as, inferior, to, the, nihon, shoki, until, motoori, norinaga, wrote, the, kojiki, den, in, 1913, tsuda, s, kichi, argued, in, a, study, that, the, kojiki, particularly, in, its, earlier, sections, was, neither, history, nor, myth, but, a, document, created, to, legitimize, the, rule, of, the, imperial, line, while, his, conclusions, led, to, considerable, controversy, his, influence, remains, in, subsequent, studies, of, the, text, particularly, in, post, world, war, ii, scholarship, which, amounts, largely, to, development, and, correction, of, the, line, of, thought, originally, proposed, by, him, in, reaction, to, tsuda, watsuji, tetsur, 1920, argued, for, a, literary, appreciation, of, the, kojiki, claiming, that, this, gave, it, inner, coherence, kurano, kenji, 1927, took, it, a, step, further, proposing, that, the, kojiki, may, best, be, compared, with, western, epic, literature, and, regarded, as, a, national, epic, like, beowulf, is, in, the, english, speaking, world, during, the, 1920s, and, 30s, linguist, hashimoto, shinkichi, studied, the, phonology, of, the, old, japanese, language, and, his, conclusions, were, applied, by, scholars, to, the, study, of, the, text, the, kojiki, continued, to, attract, the, attention, of, academics, and, other, specialists, in, the, post, war, period, which, saw, the, appearance, of, numerous, editions, translations, and, commentaries, on, the, text, by, authors, such, as, kurano, kenji, takeda, y, kichi, saig, nobutsuna, and, k, noshi, takamitsu, there, are, two, major, branches, of, kojiki, manuscripts, ise, and, urabe, the, extant, urabe, branch, consists, of, 36, existing, manuscripts, all, based, on, the, 1522, copies, by, urabe, kanenaga, the, ise, branch, may, be, subdivided, into, the, shinpukuji, bon, manuscript, of, 1371, 1372, and, the, d, ka, bon, manuscripts, the, d, ka, sub, branch, consists, of, the, shinpukuji, bon, manuscript, 1371, 1372, is, the, oldest, existing, manuscript, while, divided, into, the, ise, branch, it, is, actually, a, mixture, of, the, two, branches, the, monk, ken, yu, based, his, copy, on, nakatomi, sadayo, s, copy, in, 1266, sadayo, copied, volumes, one, and, three, but, did, not, have, access, to, the, second, volume, finally, in, 1282, he, obtained, access, to, the, second, volume, through, a, urabe, branch, manuscript, that, he, used, to, transcribe, the, kojiki, contains, various, songs, and, poems, while, the, historical, records, and, myths, are, written, in, a, form, of, the, chinese, language, the, songs, are, written, in, old, japanese, with, the, man, y, gana, writing, system, which, uses, chinese, characters, only, phonetically, the, kojiki, is, divided, into, three, parts, the, kamitsumaki, upper, volume, the, nakatsumaki, middle, volume, and, the, shimotsumaki, lower, volume, what, follows, is, a, condensed, summary, of, the, contents, of, the, text, including, many, of, the, names, of, gods, emperors, and, locations, as, well, as, events, which, took, place, in, association, with, them, the, original, japanese, is, included, in, parentheses, where, appropriate, no, yasumaro, s, preface, in, the, form, of, a, dedicatory, address, to, empress, genmei, begins, with, a, poem, summarizing, the, main, contents, of, the, work, he, then, relates, how, emperor, tenmu, commissioned, hieda, no, are, to, memorize, the, genealogies, and, records, of, the, imperial, house, years, earlier, and, how, genmei, in, turn, ordered, yasumaro, to, compile, a, written, record, of, what, are, had, learned, he, finally, concludes, the, preface, with, a, brief, explanation, of, the, chinese, characters, used, to, transcribe, native, japanese, words, in, the, text, and, the, division, of, the, work, into, three, volumes, izanagi, divides, the,
