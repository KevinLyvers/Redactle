https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism
pragmatism, is, a, philosophical, tradition, that, views, language, and, thought, as, tools, for, prediction, problem, solving, and, action, rather, than, describing, representing, or, mirroring, reality, pragmatists, contend, that, most, philosophical, topics, such, as, the, nature, of, knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and, science, are, best, viewed, in, terms, of, their, practical, uses, and, successes, pragmatism, began, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1870s, its, origins, are, often, attributed, to, philosophers, charles, sanders, peirce, william, james, and, john, dewey, in, 1878, peirce, described, it, in, his, pragmatic, maxim, consider, the, practical, effects, of, the, objects, of, your, conception, then, your, conception, of, those, effects, is, the, whole, of, your, conception, of, the, object, pragmatism, as, a, philosophical, movement, began, in, the, united, states, around, 1870, charles, sanders, peirce, and, his, pragmatic, maxim, is, given, credit, for, its, development, along, with, later, 20th, century, contributors, william, james, and, john, dewey, its, direction, was, determined, by, the, metaphysical, club, members, charles, sanders, peirce, william, james, and, chauncey, wright, as, well, as, john, dewey, and, george, herbert, mead, the, word, pragmatic, has, existed, in, english, since, the, 1500s, a, word, borrowed, from, french, and, ultimately, derived, from, greek, via, latin, the, greek, word, pragma, meaning, business, deed, or, act, is, a, noun, derived, from, the, verb, prassein, to, do, the, first, use, in, print, of, the, name, pragmatism, was, in, 1898, by, james, who, credited, peirce, with, coining, the, term, during, the, early, 1870s, james, regarded, peirce, s, illustrations, of, the, logic, of, science, series, including, the, fixation, of, belief, 1877, and, especially, how, to, make, our, ideas, clear, 1878, as, the, foundation, of, pragmatism, peirce, in, turn, wrote, in, 1906, that, nicholas, st, john, green, had, been, instrumental, by, emphasizing, the, importance, of, applying, alexander, bain, s, definition, of, belief, which, was, that, upon, which, a, man, is, prepared, to, act, peirce, wrote, that, from, this, definition, pragmatism, is, scarce, more, than, a, corollary, so, that, i, am, disposed, to, think, of, him, as, the, grandfather, of, pragmatism, john, shook, has, said, chauncey, wright, also, deserves, considerable, credit, for, as, both, peirce, and, james, recall, it, was, wright, who, demanded, a, phenomenalist, and, fallibilist, empiricism, as, an, alternative, to, rationalistic, speculation, peirce, developed, the, idea, that, inquiry, depends, on, real, doubt, not, mere, verbal, or, hyperbolic, doubt, and, said, that, in, order, to, understand, a, conception, in, a, fruitful, way, consider, the, practical, effects, of, the, objects, of, your, conception, then, your, conception, of, those, effects, is, the, whole, of, your, conception, of, the, object, which, he, later, called, the, pragmatic, maxim, it, equates, any, conception, of, an, object, to, the, general, extent, of, the, conceivable, implications, for, informed, practice, of, that, object, s, effects, this, is, the, heart, of, his, pragmatism, as, a, method, of, experimentational, mental, reflection, arriving, at, conceptions, in, terms, of, conceivable, confirmatory, and, disconfirmatory, circumstances, a, method, hospitable, to, the, generation, of, explanatory, hypotheses, and, conducive, to, the, employment, and, improvement, of, verification, typical, of, peirce, is, his, concern, with, inference, to, explanatory, hypotheses, as, outside, the, usual, foundational, alternative, between, deductivist, rationalism, and, inductivist, empiricism, although, he, was, a, mathematical, logician, and, a, founder, of, statistics, peirce, lectured, and, further, wrote, on, pragmatism, to, make, clear, his, own, interpretation, while, framing, a, conception, s, meaning, in, terms, of, conceivable, tests, peirce, emphasized, that, since, a, conception, is, general, its, meaning, its, intellectual, purport, equates, to, its, acceptance, s, implications, for, general, practice, rather, than, to, any, definite, set, of, real, effects, or, test, results, a, conception, s, clarified, meaning, points, toward, its, conceivable, verifications, but, the, outcomes, are, not, meanings, but, individual, upshots, peirce, in, 1905, coined, the, new, name, pragmaticism, for, the, precise, purpose, of, expressing, the, original, definition, saying, that, all, went, happily, with, james, s, and, f, c, s, schiller, s, variant, uses, of, the, old, name, pragmatism, and, that, he, nonetheless, coined, the, new, name, because, of, the, old, name, s, growing, use, in, literary, journals, where, it, gets, abused, yet, in, a, 1906, manuscript, he, cited, as, causes, his, differences, with, james, and, schiller, and, in, a, 1908, publication, his, differences, with, james, as, well, as, literary, author, giovanni, papini, peirce, regarded, his, own, views, that, truth, is, immutable, and, infinity, is, real, as, being, opposed, by, the, other, pragmatists, but, he, remained, allied, with, them, about, the, falsity, of, necessitarianism, and, about, the, reality, of, generals, and, habits, understood, in, terms, of, potential, concrete, effects, even, if, unactualized, pragmatism, enjoyed, renewed, attention, after, willard, van, orman, quine, and, wilfrid, sellars, used, a, revised, pragmatism, to, criticize, logical, positivism, in, the, 1960s, inspired, by, the, work, of, quine, and, sellars, a, brand, of, pragmatism, known, sometimes, as, neopragmatism, gained, influence, through, richard, rorty, the, most, influential, of, the, late, 20th, century, pragmatists, along, with, hilary, putnam, and, robert, brandom, contemporary, pragmatism, may, be, broadly, divided, into, a, strict, analytic, tradition, and, a, neo, classical, pragmatism, such, as, susan, haack, that, adheres, to, the, work, of, peirce, james, and, dewey, a, few, of, the, various, but, often, interrelated, positions, characteristic, of, philosophers, working, from, a, pragmatist, approach, include, dewey, in, the, quest, for, certainty, criticized, what, he, called, the, philosophical, fallacy, philosophers, often, take, categories, such, as, the, mental, and, the, physical, for, granted, because, they, don, t, realize, that, these, are, nominal, concepts, that, were, invented, to, help, solve, specific, problems, this, causes, metaphysical, and, conceptual, confusion, various, examples, are, the, ultimate, being, of, hegelian, philosophers, the, belief, in, a, realm, of, value, the, idea, that, logic, because, it, is, an, abstraction, from, concrete, thought, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, action, of, concrete, thinking, david, l, hildebrand, summarized, the, problem, perceptual, inattention, to, the, specific, functions, comprising, inquiry, led, realists, and, idealists, alike, to, formulate, accounts, of, knowledge, that, project, the, products, of, extensive, abstraction, back, onto, experience, 40, from, the, outset, pragmatists, wanted, to, reform, philosophy, and, bring, it, more, in, line, with, the, scientific, method, as, they, understood, it, they, argued, that, idealist, and, realist, philosophy, had, a, tendency, to, present, human, knowledge, as, something, beyond, what, science, could, grasp, they, held, that, these, philosophies, then, resorted, either, to, a, phenomenology, inspired, by, kant, or, to, correspondence, theories, of, knowledge, and, truth, pragmatists, criticized, the, former, for, its, a, priorism, and, the, latter, because, it, takes, correspondence, as, an, unanalyzable, fact, pragmatism, instead, tries, to, explain, the, relation, between, knower, and, known, in, 1868, c, s, peirce, argued, that, there, is, no, power, of, intuition, in, the, sense, of, a, cognition, unconditioned, by, inference, and, no, power, of, introspection, intuitive, or, otherwise, and, that, awareness, of, an, internal, world, is, by, hypothetical, inference, from, external, facts, introspection, and, intuition, were, staple, philosophical, tools, at, least, since, descartes, he, argued, that, there, is, no, absolutely, first, cognition, in, a, cognitive, process, such, a, process, has, its, beginning, but, can, always, be, analyzed, into, finer, cognitive, stages, that, which, we, call, introspection, does, not, give, privileged, access, to, knowledge, about, the, mind, the, self, is, a, concept, that, is, derived, from, our, interaction, with, the, external, world, and, not, the, other, way, around, at, the, same, time, he, held, persistently, that, pragmatism, and, epistemology, in, general, could, not, be, derived, from, principles, of, psychology, understood, as, a, special, science, what, we, do, think, is, too, different, from, what, we, should, think, in, his, illustrations, of, the, logic, of, science, series, peirce, formulated, both, pragmatism, and, principles, of, statistics, as, aspects, of, scientific, method, in, general, this, is, an, important, point, of, disagreement, with, most, other, pragmatists, who, advocate, a, more, thorough, naturalism, and, psychologism, richard, rorty, expanded, on, these, and, other, arguments, in, philosophy, and, the, mirror, of, nature, in, which, he, criticized, attempts, by, many, philosophers, of, science, to, carve, out, a, space, for, epistemology, that, is, entirely, unrelated, to, and, sometimes, thought, of, as, superior, to, the, empirical, sciences, w, v, quine, who, was, instrumental, in, bringing, naturalized, epistemology, back, into, favor, with, his, essay, epistemology, naturalized, also, criticized, traditional, epistemology, and, its, cartesian, dream, of, absolute, certainty, the, dream, he, argued, was, impossible, in, practice, as, well, as, misguided, in, theory, because, it, separates, epistemology, from, scientific, inquiry, hilary, putnam, has, suggested, that, the, reconciliation, of, anti, skepticism, and, fallibilism, is, the, central, goal, of, american, pragmatism, although, all, human, knowledge, is, partial, with, no, ability, to, take, a, god, s, eye, view, this, does, not, necessitate, a, globalized, skeptical, attitude, a, radical, philosophical, skepticism, as, distinguished, from, that, which, is, called, scientific, skepticism, peirce, insisted, that, 1, in, reasoning, there, is, the, presupposition, and, at, least, the, hope, that, truth, and, the, real, are, discoverable, and, would, be, discovered, sooner, or, later, but, still, inevitably, by, investigation, taken, far, enough, and, 2, contrary, to, descartes, s, famous, and, influential, methodology, in, the, meditations, on, first, philosophy, doubt, cannot, be, feigned, or, created, by, verbal, fiat, to, motivate, fruitful, inquiry, and, much, less, can, philosophy, begin, in, universal, doubt, doubt, like, belief, requires, justification, genuine, doubt, irritates, and, inhibits, in, the, sense, that, belief, is, that, upon, which, one, is, prepared, to, act, it, arises, from, confrontation, with, some, specific, recalcitrant, matter, of, fact, which, dewey, called, a, situation, which, unsettles, our, belief, in, some, specific, proposition, inquiry, is, then, the, rationally, self, controlled, process, of, attempting, to, return, to, a, settled, state, of, belief, about, the, matter, note, that, anti, skepticism, is, a, reaction, to, modern, academic, skepticism, in, the, wake, of, descartes, the, pragmatist, insistence, that, all, knowledge, is, tentative, is, quite, congenial, to, the, older, skeptical, tradition, pragmatism, was, not, the, first, to, apply, evolution, to, theories, of, knowledge, schopenhauer, advocated, a, biological, idealism, as, what, s, useful, to, an, organism, to, believe, might, differ, wildly, from, what, is, true, here, knowledge, and, action, are, portrayed, as, two, separate, spheres, with, an, absolute, or, transcendental, truth, above, and, beyond, any, sort, of, inquiry, organisms, used, to, cope, with, life, pragmatism, challenges, this, idealism, by, providing, an, ecological, account, of, knowledge, inquiry, is, how, organisms, can, get, a, grip, on, their, environment, real, and, true, are, functional, labels, in, inquiry, and, cannot, be, understood, outside, of, this, context, it, is, not, realist, in, a, traditionally, robust, sense, of, realism, what, hilary, putnam, later, called, metaphysical, realism, but, it, is, realist, in, how, it, acknowledges, an, external, world, which, must, be, dealt, with, many, of, james, best, turned, phrases, truth, s, cash, value, and, the, true, is, only, the, expedient, in, our, way, of, thinking, were, taken, out, of, context, and, caricatured, in, contemporary, literature, as, representing, the, view, where, any, idea, with, practical, utility, is, true, william, james, wrote, it, is, high, time, to, urge, the, use, of, a, little, imagination, in, philosophy, the, unwillingness, of, some, of, our, critics, to, read, any, but, the, silliest, of, possible, meanings, into, our, statements, is, as, discreditable, to, their, imaginations, as, anything, i, know, in, recent, philosophic, history, schiller, says, the, truth, is, that, which, works, thereupon, he, is, treated, as, one, who, limits, verification, to, the, lowest, material, utilities, dewey, says, truth, is, what, gives, satisfaction, he, is, treated, as, one, who, believes, in, calling, everything, true, which, if, it, were, true, would, be, pleasant, in, reality, james, asserts, the, theory, is, a, great, deal, more, subtle, the, role, of, belief, in, representing, reality, is, widely, debated, in, pragmatism, is, a, belief, valid, when, it, represents, reality, copying, is, one, and, only, one, genuine, mode, of, knowing, are, beliefs, dispositions, which, qualify, as, true, or, false, depending, on, how, helpful, they, prove, in, inquiry, and, in, action, is, it, only, in, the, struggle, of, intelligent, organisms, with, the, surrounding, environment, that, beliefs, acquire, meaning, does, a, belief, only, become, true, when, it, succeeds, in, this, struggle, in, james, s, pragmatism, nothing, practical, or, useful, is, held, to, be, necessarily, true, nor, is, anything, which, helps, to, survive, merely, in, the, short, term, for, example, to, believe, my, cheating, spouse, is, faithful, may, help, me, feel, better, now, but, it, is, certainly, not, useful, from, a, more, long, term, perspective, because, it, doesn, t, accord, with, the, facts, and, is, therefore, not, true, while, pragmatism, started, simply, as, a, criterion, of, meaning, it, quickly, expanded, to, become, a, full, fledged, epistemology, with, wide, ranging, implications, for, the, entire, philosophical, field, pragmatists, who, work, in, these, fields, share, a, common, inspiration, but, their, work, is, diverse, and, there, are, no, received, views, in, the, philosophy, of, science, instrumentalism, is, the, view, that, concepts, and, theories, are, merely, useful, instruments, and, progress, in, science, cannot, be, couched, in, terms, of, concepts, and, theories, somehow, mirroring, reality, instrumentalist, philosophers, often, define, scientific, progress, as, nothing, more, than, an, improvement, in, explaining, and, predicting, phenomena, instrumentalism, does, not, state, that, truth, does, not, matter, but, rather, provides, a, specific, answer, to, the, question, of, what, truth, and, falsity, mean, and, how, they, function, in, science, one, of, c, i, lewis, main, arguments, in, mind, and, the, world, order, outline, of, a, theory, of, knowledge, 1929, was, that, science, does, not, merely, provide, a, copy, of, reality, but, must, work, with, conceptual, systems, and, that, those, are, chosen, for, pragmatic, reasons, that, is, because, they, aid, inquiry, lewis, own, development, of, multiple, modal, logics, is, a, case, in, point, lewis, is, sometimes, called, a, proponent, of, conceptual, pragmatism, because, of, this, another, development, is, the, cooperation, of, logical, positivism, and, pragmatism, in, the, works, of, charles, w, morris, and, rudolf, carnap, the, influence, of, pragmatism, on, these, writers, is, mostly, limited, to, the, incorporation, of, the, pragmatic, maxim, into, their, epistemology, pragmatists, with, a, broader, conception, of, the, movement, do, not, often, refer, to, them, w, v, quine, s, paper, two, dogmas, of, empiricism, published, in, 1951, is, one, of, the, most, celebrated, papers, of, 20th, century, philosophy, in, the, analytic, tradition, the, paper, is, an, attack, on, two, central, tenets, of, the, logical, positivists, philosophy, one, is, the, distinction, between, analytic, statements, tautologies, and, contradictions, whose, truth, or, falsehood, is, a, function, of, the, meanings, of, the, words, in, the, statement, all, bachelors, are, unmarried, and, synthetic, statements, whose, truth, or, falsehood, is, a, function, of, contingent, states, of, affairs, the, other, is, reductionism, the, theory, that, each, meaningful, statement, gets, its, meaning, from, some, logical, construction, of, terms, which, refers, exclusively, to, immediate, experience, quine, s, argument, brings, to, mind, peirce, s, insistence, that, axioms, are, not, a, priori, truths, but, synthetic, statements, later, in, his, life, schiller, became, famous, for, his, attacks, on, logic, in, his, textbook, formal, logic, by, then, schiller, s, pragmatism, had, become, the, nearest, of, any, of, the, classical, pragmatists, to, an, ordinary, language, philosophy, schiller, sought, to, undermine, the, very, possibility, of, formal, logic, by, showing, that, words, only, had, meaning, when, used, in, context, the, least, famous, of, schiller, s, main, works, was, the, constructive, sequel, to, his, destructive, book, formal, logic, in, this, sequel, logic, for, use, schiller, attempted, to, construct, a, new, logic, to, replace, the, formal, logic, that, he, had, criticized, in, formal, logic, what, he, offers, is, something, philosophers, would, recognize, today, as, a, logic, covering, the, context, of, discovery, and, the, hypothetico, deductive, method, whereas, schiller, dismissed, the, possibility, of, formal, logic, most, pragmatists, are, critical, rather, of, its, pretension, to, ultimate, validity, and, see, logic, as, one, logical, tool, among, others, or, perhaps, considering, the, multitude, of, formal, logics, one, set, of, tools, among, others, this, is, the, view, of, c, i, lewis, c, s, peirce, developed, multiple, methods, for, doing, formal, logic, stephen, toulmin, s, the, uses, of, argument, inspired, scholars, in, informal, logic, and, rhetoric, studies, although, it, is, an, epistemological, work, james, and, dewey, were, empirical, thinkers, in, the, most, straightforward, fashion, experience, is, the, ultimate, test, and, experience, is, what, needs, to, be, explained, they, were, dissatisfied, with, ordinary, empiricism, because, in, the, tradition, dating, from, hume, empiricists, had, a, tendency, to, think, of, experience, as, nothing, more, than, individual, sensations, to, the, pragmatists, this, went, against, the, spirit, of, empiricism, we, should, try, to, explain, all, that, is, given, in, experience, including, connections, and, meaning, instead, of, explaining, them, away, and, positing, sense, data, as, the, ultimate, reality, radical, empiricism, or, immediate, empiricism, in, dewey, s, words, wants, to, give, a, place, to, meaning, and, value, instead, of, explaining, them, away, as, subjective, additions, to, a, world, of, whizzing, atoms, william, james, gives, an, interesting, example, of, this, philosophical, shortcoming, began, by, saying, that, he, had, always, taken, for, granted, that, when, you, entered, a, philosophic, classroom, you, had, to, open, relations, with, a, universe, entirely, distinct, from, the, one, you, left, behind, you, in, the, street, the, two, were, supposed, he, said, to, have, so, little, to, do, with, each, other, that, you, could, not, possibly, occupy, your, mind, with, them, at, the, same, time, the, world, of, concrete, personal, experiences, to, which, the, street, belongs, is, multitudinous, beyond, imagination, tangled, muddy, painful, and, perplexed, the, world, to, which, your, philosophy, professor, introduces, you, is, simple, clean, and, noble, the, contradictions, of, real, life, are, absent, from, it, in, point, of, fact, it, is, far, less, an, account, of, this, actual, world, than, a, clear, addition, built, upon, it, it, is, no, explanation, of, our, concrete, universe, f, c, s, schiller, s, first, book, riddles, of, the, sphinx, was, published, before, he, became, aware, of, the, growing, pragmatist, movement, taking, place, in, america, in, it, schiller, argues, for, a, middle, ground, between, materialism, and, absolute, metaphysics, these, opposites, are, comparable, to, what, william, james, called, tough, minded, empiricism, and, tender, minded, rationalism, schiller, contends, on, the, one, hand, that, mechanistic, naturalism, cannot, make, sense, of, the, higher, aspects, of, our, world, these, include, free, will, consciousness, purpose, universals, and, some, would, add, god, on, the, other, hand, abstract, metaphysics, cannot, make, sense, of, the, lower, aspects, of, our, world, e, g, the, imperfect, change, physicality, while, schiller, is, vague, about, the, exact, sort, of, middle, ground, he, is, trying, to, establish, he, suggests, that, metaphysics, is, a, tool, that, can, aid, inquiry, but, that, it, is, valuable, only, insofar, as, it, does, help, in, explanation, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, stephen, toulmin, argued, that, the, need, to, distinguish, between, reality, and, appearance, only, arises, within, an, explanatory, scheme, and, therefore, that, there, is, no, point, in, asking, what, ultimate, reality, consists, of, more, recently, a, similar, idea, has, been, suggested, by, the, postanalytic, philosopher, daniel, dennett, who, argues, that, anyone, who, wants, to, understand, the, world, has, to, acknowledge, both, the, syntactical, aspects, of, reality, i, e, whizzing, atoms, and, its, emergent, or, semantic, properties, i, e, meaning, and, value, radical, empiricism, gives, answers, to, questions, about, the, limits, of, science, the, nature, of, meaning, and, value, and, the, workability, of, reductionism, these, questions, feature, prominently, in, current, debates, about, the, relationship, between, religion, and, science, where, it, is, often, assumed, most, pragmatists, would, disagree, that, science, degrades, everything, that, is, meaningful, into, merely, physical, phenomena, both, john, dewey, in, experience, and, nature, 1929, and, half, a, century, later, richard, rorty, in, his, philosophy, and, the, mirror, of, nature, 1979, argued, that, much, of, the, debate, about, the, relation, of, the, mind, to, the, body, results, from, conceptual, confusions, they, argue, instead, that, there, is, no, need, to, posit, the, mind, or, mindstuff, as, an, ontological, category, pragmatists, disagree, over, whether, philosophers, ought, to, adopt, a, quietist, or, a, naturalist, stance, toward, the, mind, body, problem, the, former, including, rorty, want, to, do, away, with, the, problem, because, they, believe, it, s, a, pseudo, problem, whereas, the, latter, believe, that, it, is, a, meaningful, empirical, question, pragmatism, sees, no, fundamental, difference, between, practical, and, theoretical, reason, nor, any, ontological, difference, between, facts, and, values, pragmatist, ethics, is, broadly, humanist, because, it, sees, no, ultimate, test, of, morality, beyond, what, matters, for, us, as, humans, good, values, are, those, for, which, we, have, good, reasons, viz, the, good, reasons, approach, the, pragmatist, formulation, pre, dates, those, of, other, philosophers, who, have, stressed, important, similarities, between, values, and, facts, such, as, jerome, schneewind, and, john, searle, william, james, contribution, to, ethics, as, laid, out, in, his, essay, the, will, to, believe, has, often, been, misunderstood, as, a, plea, for, relativism, or, irrationality, on, its, own, terms, it, argues, that, ethics, always, involves, a, certain, degree, of, trust, or, faith, and, that, we, cannot, always, wait, for, adequate, proof, when, making, moral, decisions, moral, questions, immediately, present, themselves, as, questions, whose, solution, cannot, wait, for, sensible, proof, a, moral, question, is, a, question, not, of, what, sensibly, exists, but, of, what, is, good, or, would, be, good, if, it, did, exist, a, social, organism, of, any, sort, whatever, large, or, small, is, what, it, is, because, each, member, proceeds, to, his, own, duty, with, a, trust, that, the, other, members, will, simultaneously, do, theirs, wherever, a, desired, result, is, achieved, by, the, co, operation, of, many, independent, persons, its, existence, as, a, fact, is, a, pure, consequence, of, the, precursive, faith, in, one, another, of, those, immediately, concerned, a, government, an, army, a, commercial, system, a, ship, a, college, an, athletic, team, all, exist, on, this, condition, without, which, not, only, is, nothing, achieved, but, nothing, is, even, attempted, of, the, classical, pragmatists, john, dewey, wrote, most, extensively, about, morality, and, democracy, in, his, classic, article, three, independent, factors, in, morals, he, tried, to, integrate, three, basic, philosophical, perspectives, on, morality, the, right, the, virtuous, and, the, good, he, held, that, while, all, three, provide, meaningful, ways, to, think, about, moral, questions, the, possibility, of, conflict, among, the, three, elements, cannot, always, be, easily, solved, dewey, also, criticized, the, dichotomy, between, means, and, ends, which, he, saw, as, responsible, for, the, degradation, of, our, everyday, working, lives, and, education, both, conceived, as, merely, a, means, to, an, end, he, stressed, the, need, for, meaningful, labor, and, a, conception, of, education, that, viewed, it, not, as, a, preparation, for, life, but, as, life, itself, dewey, was, opposed, to, other, ethical, philosophies, of, his, time, notably, the, emotivism, of, alfred, ayer, dewey, envisioned, the, possibility, of, ethics, as, an, experimental, discipline, and, thought, values, could, best, be, characterized, not, as, feelings, or, imperatives, but, as, hypotheses, about, what, actions, will, lead, to, satisfactory, results, or, what, he, termed, consummatory, experience, an, additional, implication, of, this, view, is, that, ethics, is, a, fallible, undertaking, because, human, beings, are, frequently, unable, to, know, what, would, satisfy, them, during, the, late, 1900s, and, first, decade, of, 2000, pragmatism, was, embraced, by, many, in, the, field, of, bioethics, led, by, the, philosophers, john, lachs, and, his, student, glenn, mcgee, whose, 1997, book, the, perfect, baby, a, pragmatic, approach, to, genetic, engineering, see, designer, baby, garnered, praise, from, within, classical, american, philosophy, and, criticism, from, bioethics, for, its, development, of, a, theory, of, pragmatic, bioethics, and, its, rejection, of, the, principalism, theory, then, in, vogue, in, medical, ethics, an, anthology, published, by, the, mit, press, titled, pragmatic, bioethics, included, the, responses, of, philosophers, to, that, debate, including, micah, hester, griffin, trotter, and, others, many, of, whom, developed, their, own, theories, based, on, the, work, of, dewey, peirce, royce, and, others, lachs, developed, several, applications, of, pragmatism, to, bioethics, independent, of, but, extending, from, the, work, of, dewey, and, james, a, recent, pragmatist, contribution, to, meta, ethics, is, todd, lekan, s, making, morality, lekan, argues, that, morality, is, a, fallible, but, rational, practice, and, that, it, has, traditionally, been, misconceived, as, based, on, theory, or, principles, instead, he, argues, theory, and, rules, arise, as, tools, to, make, practice, more, intelligent, john, dewey, s, art, as, experience, based, on, the, william, james, lectures, he, delivered, at, harvard, university, was, an, attempt, to, show, the, integrity, of, art, culture, and, everyday, experience, iep, art, for, dewey, is, or, should, be, a, part, of, everyone, s, creative, lives, and, not, just, the, privilege, of, a, select, group, of, artists, he, also, emphasizes, that, the, audience, is, more, than, a, passive, recipient, dewey, s, treatment, of, art, was, a, move, away, from, the, transcendental, approach, to, aesthetics, in, the, wake, of, immanuel, kant, who, emphasized, the, unique, character, of, art, and, the, disinterested, nature, of, aesthetic, appreciation, a, notable, contemporary, pragmatist, aesthetician, is, joseph, margolis, he, defines, a, work, of, art, as, a, physically, embodied, culturally, emergent, entity, a, human, utterance, that, isn, t, an, ontological, quirk, but, in, line, with, other, human, activity, and, culture, in, general, he, emphasizes, that, works, of, art, are, complex, and, difficult, to, fathom, and, that, no, determinate, interpretation, can, be, given, both, dewey, and, james, investigated, the, role, that, religion, can, still, play, in, contemporary, society, the, former, in, a, common, faith, and, the, latter, in, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, from, a, general, point, of, view, for, william, james, something, is, true, only, insofar, as, it, works, thus, the, statement, for, example, that, prayer, is, heard, may, work, on, a, psychological, level, but, a, may, not, help, to, bring, about, the, things, you, pray, for, b, may, be, better, explained, by, referring, to, its, soothing, effect, than, by, claiming, prayers, are, heard, as, such, pragmatism, is, not, antithetical, to, religion, but, it, is, not, an, apologetic, for, faith, either, james, metaphysical, position, however, leaves, open, the, possibility, that, the, ontological, claims, of, religions, may, be, true, as, he, observed, in, the, end, of, the, varieties, his, position, does, not, amount, to, a, denial, of, the, existence, of, transcendent, realities, quite, the, contrary, he, argued, for, the, legitimate, epistemic, right, to, believe, in, such, realities, since, such, beliefs, do, make, a, difference, in, an, individual, s, life, and, refer, to, claims, that, cannot, be, verified, or, falsified, either, on, intellectual, or, common, sensorial, grounds, joseph, margolis, in, historied, thought, constructed, world, california, 1995, makes, a, distinction, between, existence, and, reality, he, suggests, using, the, term, exists, only, for, those, things, which, adequately, exhibit, peirce, s, secondness, things, which, offer, brute, physical, resistance, to, our, movements, in, this, way, such, things, which, affect, us, like, numbers, may, be, said, to, be, real, although, they, do, not, exist, margolis, suggests, that, god, in, such, a, linguistic, usage, might, very, well, be, real, causing, believers, to, act, in, such, and, such, a, way, but, might, not, exist, pragmatic, pedagogy, is, an, educational, philosophy, that, emphasizes, teaching, students, knowledge, that, is, practical, for, life, and, encourages, them, to, grow, into, better, people, american, philosopher, john, dewey, is, considered, one, of, the, main, thinkers, of, the, pragmatist, educational, approach, neopragmatism, is, a, broad, contemporary, category, used, for, various, thinkers, that, incorporate, important, insights, of, and, yet, significantly, diverge, from, the, classical, pragmatists, this, divergence, may, occur, either, in, their, philosophical, methodology, many, of, them, are, loyal, to, the, analytic, tradition, or, in, conceptual, formation, for, example, conceptual, pragmatist, c, i, lewis, was, very, critical, of, dewey, neopragmatist, richard, rorty, disliked, peirce, important, analytic, pragmatists, include, early, richard, rorty, who, was, the, first, to, develop, neopragmatist, philosophy, in, his, philosophy, and, the, mirror, of, nature, 1979, hilary, putnam, w, v, o, quine, and, donald, davidson, brazilian, social, thinker, roberto, unger, advocates, for, a, radical, pragmatism, one, that, de, naturalizes, society, and, culture, and, thus, insists, that, we, can, transform, the, character, of, our, relation, to, social, and, cultural, worlds, we, inhabit, rather, than, just, to, change, little, by, little, the, content, of, the, arrangements, and, beliefs, that, comprise, them, late, rorty, and, j, rgen, habermas, are, closer, to, continental, thought, neopragmatist, thinkers, who, are, more, loyal, to, classical, pragmatism, include, sidney, hook, and, susan, haack, known, for, the, theory, of, foundherentism, many, pragmatist, ideas, especially, those, of, peirce, find, a, natural, expression, in, the, decision, theoretic, reconstruction, of, epistemology, pursued, in, the, work, of, isaac, levi, nicholas, rescher, advocates, his, version, of, methodological, pragmatism, based, on, construing, pragmatic, efficacy, not, as, a, replacement, for, truths, but, as, a, means, to, its, evidentiation, rescher, is, also, a, proponent, of, pragmatic, idealism, not, all, pragmatists, are, easily, characterized, with, the, advent, of, postanalytic, philosophy, and, the, diversification, of, anglo, american, philosophy, many, philosophers, were, influenced, by, pragmatist, thought, without, necessarily, publicly, committing, themselves, to, that, philosophical, school, daniel, dennett, a, student, of, quine, s, falls, into, this, category, as, does, stephen, toulmin, who, arrived, at, his, philosophical, position, via, wittgenstein, whom, he, calls, a, pragmatist, of, a, sophisticated, kind, another, example, is, mark, johnson, whose, embodied, philosophy, shares, its, psychologism, direct, realism, and, anti, cartesianism, with, pragmatism, conceptual, pragmatism, is, a, theory, of, knowledge, originating, with, the, work, of, the, philosopher, and, logician, clarence, irving, lewis, the, epistemology, of, conceptual, pragmatism, was, first, formulated, in, the, 1929, book, mind, and, the, world, order, outline, of, a, theory, of, knowledge, french, pragmatism, is, attended, with, theorists, such, as, michel, callon, bruno, latour, michel, crozier, luc, boltanski, and, laurent, th, venot, it, often, is, seen, as, opposed, to, structural, problems, connected, to, the, french, critical, theory, of, pierre, bourdieu, french, pragmatism, has, more, recently, made, inroads, into, american, sociology, and, anthropology, as, well, philosophers, john, r, shook, and, tibor, solymosi, said, that, each, new, generation, rediscovers, and, reinvents, its, own, versions, of, pragmatism, by, applying, the, best, available, practical, and, scientific, methods, to, philosophical, problems, of, contemporary, concern, in, the, 20th, century, the, movements, of, logical, positivism, and, ordinary, language, philosophy, have, similarities, with, pragmatism, like, pragmatism, logical, positivism, provides, a, verification, criterion, of, meaning, that, is, supposed, to, rid, us, of, nonsense, metaphysics, however, logical, positivism, doesn, t, stress, action, as, pragmatism, does, the, pragmatists, rarely, used, their, maxim, of, meaning, to, rule, out, all, metaphysics, as, nonsense, usually, pragmatism, was, put, forth, to, correct, metaphysical, doctrines, or, to, construct, empirically, verifiable, ones, rather, than, to, provide, a, wholesale, rejection, ordinary, language, philosophy, is, closer, to, pragmatism, than, other, philosophy, of, language, because, of, its, nominalist, character, although, peirce, s, pragmatism, is, not, nominalist, and, because, it, takes, the, broader, functioning, of, language, in, an, environment, as, its, focus, instead, of, investigating, abstract, relations, between, language, and, world, pragmatism, has, ties, to, process, philosophy, much, of, the, classical, pragmatists, work, developed, in, dialogue, with, process, philosophers, such, as, henri, bergson, and, alfred, north, whitehead, who, aren, t, usually, considered, pragmatists, because, they, differ, so, much, on, other, points, nonetheless, philosopher, donovan, irven, argues, there, s, a, strong, connection, between, henri, bergson, pragmatist, william, james, and, the, existentialist, jean, paul, sartre, regarding, their, theories, of, truth, behaviorism, and, functionalism, in, psychology, and, sociology, also, have, ties, to, pragmatism, which, is, not, surprising, considering, that, james, and, dewey, were, both, scholars, of, psychology, and, that, mead, became, a, sociologist, pragmatism, emphasizes, the, connection, between, thought, and, action, applied, fields, like, public, administration, political, science, leadership, studies, international, relations, conflict, resolution, and, research, methodology, have, incorporated, the, tenets, of, pragmatism, in, their, field, often, this, connection, is, made, using, dewey, and, addams, s, expansive, notion, of, democracy, in, the, early, 20th, century, symbolic, interactionism, a, major, perspective, within, sociological, social, psychology, was, derived, from, pragmatism, especially, the, work, of, george, herbert, mead, and, charles, cooley, as, well, as, that, of, peirce, and, william, james, increasing, attention, is, being, given, to, pragmatist, epistemology, in, other, branches, of, the, social, sciences, which, have, struggled, with, divisive, debates, over, the, status, of, social, scientific, knowledge, enthusiasts, suggest, that, pragmatism, offers, an, approach, that, is, both, pluralist, and, practical, the, classical, pragmatism, of, john, dewey, william, james, and, charles, sanders, peirce, has, influenced, research, in, the, field, of, public, administration, scholars, claim, classical, pragmatism, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, origin, of, the, field, of, public, administration, at, the, most, basic, level, public, administrators, are, responsible, for, making, programs, work, in, a, pluralistic, problems, oriented, environment, public, administrators, are, also, responsible, for, the, day, to, day, work, with, citizens, dewey, s, participatory, democracy, can, be, applied, in, this, environment, dewey, and, james, notion, of, theory, as, a, tool, helps, administrators, craft, theories, to, resolve, policy, and, administrative, problems, further, the, birth, of, american, public, administration, coincides, closely, with, the, period, of, greatest, influence, of, the, classical, pragmatists, which, pragmatism, classical, pragmatism, or, neo, pragmatism, makes, the, most, sense, in, public, administration, has, been, the, source, of, debate, the, debate, began, when, patricia, m, shields, introduced, dewey, s, notion, of, the, community, of, inquiry, hugh, miller, objected, to, one, element, of, the, community, of, inquiry, problematic, situation, scientific, attitude, participatory, democracy, scientific, attitude, a, debate, that, included, responses, from, a, practitioner, an, economist, a, planner, other, public, administration, scholars, and, noted, philosophers, followed, miller, and, shields, also, responded, in, addition, applied, scholarship, of, public, administration, that, assesses, charter, schools, contracting, out, or, outsourcing, financial, management, performance, measurement, urban, quality, of, life, initiatives, and, urban, planning, in, part, draws, on, the, ideas, of, classical, pragmatism, in, the, development, of, the, conceptual, framework, and, focus, of, analysis, the, health, sector, s, administrators, use, of, pragmatism, has, been, criticized, as, incomplete, in, its, pragmatism, however, according, to, the, classical, pragmatists, knowledge, is, always, shaped, by, human, interests, the, administrator, s, focus, on, outcomes, simply, advances, their, own, interest, and, this, focus, on, outcomes, often, undermines, their, citizen, s, interests, which, often, are, more, concerned, with, process, on, the, other, hand, david, brendel, argues, that, pragmatism, s, ability, to, bridge, dualisms, focus, on, practical, problems, include, multiple, perspectives, incorporate, participation, from, interested, parties, patient, family, health, team, and, provisional, nature, makes, it, well, suited, to, address, problems, in, this, area, since, the, mid, 1990s, feminist, philosophers, have, re, discovered, classical, pragmatism, as, a, source, of, feminist, theories, works, by, seigfried, duran, keith, and, whipps, explore, the, historic, and, philosophic, links, between, feminism, and, pragmatism, the, connection, between, pragmatism, and, feminism, took, so, long, to, be, rediscovered, because, pragmatism, itself, was, eclipsed, by, logical, positivism, during, the, middle, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, as, a, result, it, was, lost, from, feminist, discourse, feminists, now, consider, pragmatism, s, greatest, strength, to, be, the, very, features, that, led, to, its, decline, these, are, persistent, and, early, criticisms, of, positivist, interpretations, of, scientific, methodology, disclosure, of, value, dimension, of, factual, claims, viewing, aesthetics, as, informing, everyday, experience, subordinating, logical, analysis, to, political, cultural, and, social, issues, linking, the, dominant, discourses, with, domination, realigning, theory, with, praxis, and, resisting, the, turn, to, epistemology, and, instead, emphasizing, concrete, experience, feminist, philosophers, point, to, jane, addams, as, a, founder, of, classical, pragmatism, mary, parker, follett, was, also, an, important, feminist, pragmatist, concerned, with, organizational, operation, during, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, in, addition, the, ideas, of, dewey, mead, and, james, are, consistent, with, many, feminist, tenets, jane, addams, john, dewey, and, george, herbert, mead, developed, their, philosophies, as, all, three, became, friends, influenced, each, other, and, were, engaged, in, the, hull, house, experience, and, women, s, rights, causes, in, the, 1908, essay, the, thirteen, pragmatisms, arthur, oncken, lovejoy, argued, that, there, s, significant, ambiguity, in, the, notion, of, the, effects, of, the, truth, of, a, proposition, and, those, of, belief, in, a, proposition, in, order, to, highlight, that, many, pragmatists, had, failed, to, recognize, that, distinction, he, identified, 13, different, philosophical, positions, that, were, each, labeled, pragmatism, the, franciscan, friar, celestine, bittle, presented, multiple, criticisms, of, pragmatism, in, his, 1936, book, reality, and, the, mind, epistemology, he, argued, that, in, william, james, s, pragmatism, truth, is, entirely, subjective, and, is, not, the, widely, accepted, definition, of, truth, which, is, correspondence, to, reality, for, bittle, defining, truth, as, what, is, useful, is, a, perversion, of, language, with, truth, reduced, essentially, to, what, is, good, it, is, no, longer, an, object, of, the, intellect, therefore, the, problem, of, knowledge, posed, by, the, intellect, is, not, solved, but, rather, renamed, renaming, truth, as, a, product, of, the, will, cannot, help, it, solve, the, problems, of, the, intellect, according, to, bittle, bittle, cited, what, he, saw, as, contradictions, in, pragmatism, such, as, using, objective, facts, to, prove, that, truth, does, not, emerge, from, objective, fact, this, reveals, that, pragmatists, do, recognize, truth, as, objective, fact, and, not, as, they, claim, what, is, useful, bittle, argued, there, are, also, some, statements, that, cannot, be, judged, on, human, welfare, at, all, such, statements, for, example, the, assertion, that, a, car, is, passing, are, matters, of, truth, and, error, and, do, not, affect, human, welfare, british, philosopher, bertrand, russell, devoted, a, chapter, each, to, james, and, dewey, in, his, 1945, book, a, history, of, western, philosophy, russell, pointed, out, areas, in, which, he, agreed, with, them, but, also, ridiculed, james, s, views, on, truth, and, dewey, s, views, on, inquiry, 17, 120, 124, hilary, putnam, later, argued, that, russell, presented, a, mere, caricature, of, james, s, views, 17, and, a, misreading, of, james, 20, while, tom, burke, argued, at, length, that, russell, presented, a, skewed, characterization, of, dewey, s, point, of, view, 121, elsewhere, in, russell, s, book, the, analysis, of, mind, russell, praised, james, s, radical, empiricism, to, which, russell, s, own, account, of, neutral, monism, was, indebted, 17, dewey, in, the, bertrand, russell, case, defended, russell, against, an, attempt, to, remove, russell, from, his, chair, at, the, college, of, the, city, of, new, york, in, 1940, neopragmatism, as, represented, by, richard, rorty, has, been, criticized, as, relativistic, both, by, other, neopragmatists, such, as, susan, haack, and, by, many, analytic, philosophers, rorty, s, early, analytic, work, however, differs, notably, from, his, later, work, which, some, including, rorty, consider, to, be, closer, to, literary, criticism, than, to, philosophy, and, which, attracts, the, brunt, of, criticism, from, his, detractors, protopragmatists, or, related, thinkers, other, i,

and, the, principle, of, practicalism, or, pragmatism, as, he, called, it, when, i, first, heard, him, enunciate, it, at, cambridge, in, the, early, is, the, clue, or, compass, by, following, which,
