in, greek, mythology, sirens, ancient, greek, singular, seir, n, plural, seir, nes, are, female, humanlike, beings, with, alluring, voices, they, appear, in, a, scene, in, the, odyssey, in, which, odysseus, saves, his, crew, s, lives, roman, poets, place, them, on, some, small, islands, called, sirenum, scopuli, in, some, later, rationalized, traditions, the, literal, geography, of, the, flowery, island, of, anthemoessa, or, anthemusa, is, fixed, sometimes, on, cape, pelorum, and, at, others, in, the, islands, known, as, the, sirenuse, near, paestum, or, in, capreae, all, such, locations, were, surrounded, by, cliffs, and, rocks, sirens, continued, to, be, used, as, a, symbol, for, the, dangerous, temptation, embodied, by, women, regularly, throughout, christian, art, of, the, medieval, era, siren, can, also, be, used, as, a, slang, term, for, a, woman, considered, both, very, attractive, and, dangerous, the, etymology, of, the, name, is, contested, robert, s, p, beekes, has, suggested, a, pre, greek, origin, others, connect, the, name, to, seir, rope, cord, and, e, r, to, tie, join, fasten, resulting, in, the, meaning, binder, entangler, i, e, one, who, binds, or, entangles, through, magic, song, this, could, be, connected, to, the, famous, scene, of, odysseus, being, bound, to, the, mast, of, his, ship, in, order, to, resist, their, song, sirens, were, later, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, mermaids, and, portrayed, with, upper, human, bodies, and, fish, tails, this, combination, became, iconic, in, the, medieval, period, the, circumstances, leading, to, the, commingling, involve, the, treatment, of, sirens, in, the, medieval, physiologus, and, bestiaries, both, iconographically, as, well, as, textually, in, translations, from, latin, to, vulgar, languages, as, described, below, the, sirens, of, greek, mythology, first, appeared, in, homer, s, odyssey, where, homer, did, not, provide, any, physical, descriptions, and, their, visual, appearance, was, left, to, the, readers, imagination, it, was, apollonius, of, rhodes, in, argonautica, 3rd, century, bc, who, described, the, sirens, in, writing, as, part, woman, and, part, bird, by, the, 7th, century, bc, sirens, were, regularly, depicted, in, art, as, human, headed, birds, they, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, ba, bird, of, egyptian, religion, in, early, greek, art, the, sirens, were, generally, represented, as, large, birds, with, women, s, heads, bird, feathers, and, scaly, feet, later, depictions, shifted, to, show, sirens, with, human, upper, bodies, and, bird, legs, with, or, without, wings, they, were, often, shown, playing, a, variety, of, musical, instruments, especially, the, lyre, kithara, and, aulos, the, tenth, century, byzantine, dictionary, suda, stated, that, sirens, greek, had, the, form, of, sparrows, from, their, chests, up, and, below, they, were, women, or, alternatively, that, they, were, little, birds, with, women, s, faces, originally, sirens, were, shown, as, male, or, female, but, the, male, siren, disappeared, from, art, around, the, fifth, century, bc, some, surviving, classical, period, examples, had, already, depicted, the, siren, as, mermaid, like, the, sirens, are, depicted, as, mermaids, or, tritonesses, in, examples, dating, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, including, an, earthenware, bowl, found, in, athens, and, a, terracotta, oil, lamp, possibly, from, the, roman, period, the, first, known, literary, attestation, of, siren, as, a, mermaid, appeared, in, the, anglo, latin, catalogue, liber, monstrorum, early, 8th, century, ad, where, it, says, that, sirens, were, sea, girls, with, the, body, of, a, maiden, but, have, scaly, fishes, tails, the, siren, appeared, in, a, number, of, illustrated, manuscripts, of, the, physiologus, and, its, successors, called, the, bestiaries, the, siren, was, depicted, as, a, half, woman, and, half, fish, mermaid, in, the, 9th, century, berne, physiologus, as, an, early, example, but, continued, to, be, illustrated, with, both, bird, like, parts, wings, clawed, feet, and, fish, like, tail, although, a, sophocles, fragment, makes, phorcys, their, father, when, sirens, are, named, they, are, usually, as, daughters, of, the, river, god, achelous, either, by, the, muse, terpsichore, melpomene, or, calliope, or, lastly, by, sterope, daughter, of, king, porthaon, of, calydon, in, euripides, s, play, helen, 167, helen, in, her, anguish, calls, upon, winged, maidens, daughters, of, the, earth, chthon, although, they, lured, mariners, the, greeks, portrayed, the, sirens, in, their, meadow, starred, with, flowers, and, not, as, sea, deities, epimenides, claimed, that, the, sirens, were, children, of, oceanus, and, ge, sirens, are, found, in, many, greek, stories, notably, in, homer, s, odyssey, their, number, is, variously, reported, as, from, two, to, eight, in, the, odyssey, homer, says, nothing, of, their, origin, or, names, but, gives, the, number, of, the, sirens, as, two, later, writers, mention, both, their, names, and, number, some, state, that, there, were, three, peisinoe, aglaope, and, thelxiepeia, or, aglaonoe, aglaopheme, and, thelxiepeia, parthenope, ligeia, and, leucosia, apollonius, followed, hesiod, gives, their, names, as, thelxinoe, molpe, and, aglaophonos, suidas, gives, their, names, as, thelxiepeia, peisinoe, and, ligeia, hyginus, gives, the, number, of, the, sirens, as, four, teles, raidne, molpe, and, thelxiope, eustathius, states, that, they, were, two, aglaopheme, and, thelxiepeia, an, ancient, vase, painting, attests, the, two, names, as, himerope, and, thelxiepeia, their, individual, names, are, variously, rendered, in, the, later, sources, as, thelxiepeia, thelxiope, thelxinoe, molpe, himerope, aglaophonos, aglaope, aglaopheme, pisinoe, peisino, peisithoe, parthenope, ligeia, leucosia, raidne, and, teles, according, to, ovid, 43, bc, 17, ad, the, sirens, were, the, companions, of, young, persephone, demeter, gave, them, wings, to, search, for, persephone, when, she, was, abducted, by, hades, however, the, fabulae, of, hyginus, 64, bc, 17, ad, has, demeter, cursing, the, sirens, for, failing, to, intervene, in, the, abduction, of, persephone, according, to, hyginus, sirens, were, fated, to, live, only, until, the, mortals, who, heard, their, songs, were, able, to, pass, by, them, one, legend, says, that, hera, queen, of, the, gods, persuaded, the, sirens, to, enter, a, singing, contest, with, the, muses, the, muses, won, the, competition, and, then, plucked, out, all, of, the, sirens, feathers, and, made, crowns, out, of, them, out, of, their, anguish, from, losing, the, competition, writes, stephanus, of, byzantium, the, sirens, turned, white, and, fell, into, the, sea, at, aptera, featherless, where, they, formed, the, islands, in, the, bay, that, were, called, leukai, the, white, ones, modern, souda, in, the, argonautica, third, century, bc, jason, had, been, warned, by, chiron, that, orpheus, would, be, necessary, in, his, journey, when, orpheus, heard, their, voices, he, drew, out, his, lyre, and, played, his, music, more, beautifully, than, they, drowning, out, their, voices, one, of, the, crew, however, the, sharp, eared, hero, butes, heard, the, song, and, leapt, into, the, sea, but, he, was, caught, up, and, carried, safely, away, by, the, goddess, aphrodite, odysseus, was, curious, as, to, what, the, sirens, sang, to, him, and, so, on, the, advice, of, circe, he, had, all, of, his, sailors, plug, their, ears, with, beeswax, and, tie, him, to, the, mast, he, ordered, his, men, to, leave, him, tied, tightly, to, the, mast, no, matter, how, much, he, might, beg, when, he, heard, their, beautiful, song, he, ordered, the, sailors, to, untie, him, but, they, bound, him, tighter, when, they, had, passed, out, of, earshot, odysseus, demonstrated, with, his, frowns, to, be, released, some, post, homeric, authors, state, that, the, sirens, were, fated, to, die, if, someone, heard, their, singing, and, escaped, them, and, that, after, odysseus, passed, by, they, therefore, flung, themselves, into, the, water, and, perished, the, first, century, roman, historian, pliny, the, elder, discounted, sirens, as, a, pure, fable, although, dinon, the, father, of, clearchus, a, celebrated, writer, asserts, that, they, exist, in, india, and, that, they, charm, men, by, their, song, and, having, first, lulled, them, to, sleep, tear, them, to, pieces, statues, of, sirens, in, a, funerary, context, are, attested, since, the, classical, era, in, mainland, greece, as, well, as, asia, minor, and, magna, graecia, the, so, called, siren, of, canosa, canosa, di, puglia, is, a, site, in, apulia, that, was, part, of, magna, graecia, was, said, to, accompany, the, dead, among, grave, goods, in, a, burial, she, appeared, to, have, some, psychopomp, characteristics, guiding, the, dead, on, the, afterlife, journey, the, cast, terracotta, figure, bears, traces, of, its, original, white, pigment, the, woman, bears, the, feet, wings, and, tail, of, a, bird, the, sculpture, is, conserved, in, the, national, archaeological, museum, of, spain, in, madrid, the, sirens, were, called, the, muses, of, the, lower, world, classical, scholar, walter, copland, perry, 1814, 1911, observed, their, song, though, irresistibly, sweet, was, no, less, sad, than, sweet, and, lapped, both, body, and, soul, in, a, fatal, lethargy, the, forerunner, of, death, and, corruption, their, song, is, continually, calling, on, persephone, the, term, siren, song, refers, to, an, appeal, that, is, hard, to, resist, but, that, if, heeded, will, lead, to, a, bad, conclusion, later, writers, have, implied, that, the, sirens, ate, humans, based, on, circe, s, description, of, them, lolling, there, in, their, meadow, round, them, heaps, of, corpses, rotting, away, rags, of, skin, shriveling, on, their, bones, as, linguist, jane, ellen, harrison, 1850, 1928, notes, of, the, ker, as, siren, it, is, strange, and, beautiful, that, homer, should, make, the, sirens, appeal, to, the, spirit, not, to, the, flesh, the, siren, song, is, a, promise, to, odysseus, of, mantic, truths, with, a, false, promise, that, he, will, live, to, tell, them, they, sing, once, he, hears, to, his, heart, s, content, sails, on, a, wiser, man, we, know, all, the, pains, that, the, greeks, and, trojans, once, endured, on, the, spreading, plain, of, troy, when, the, gods, willed, it, so, all, that, comes, to, pass, on, the, fertile, earth, we, know, it, all, they, are, mantic, creatures, like, the, sphinx, with, whom, they, have, much, in, common, knowing, both, the, past, and, the, future, harrison, observed, their, song, takes, effect, at, midday, in, a, windless, calm, the, end, of, that, song, is, death, that, the, sailors, flesh, is, rotting, away, suggests, it, has, not, been, eaten, it, has, been, suggested, that, with, their, feathers, stolen, their, divine, nature, kept, them, alive, but, unable, to, provide, food, for, their, visitors, who, starved, to, death, by, refusing, to, leave, according, to, the, ancient, hebrew, book, of, enoch, the, women, who, were, led, astray, by, the, fallen, angels, will, be, turned, into, sirens, by, the, fourth, century, when, pagan, beliefs, were, overtaken, by, christianity, the, belief, in, literal, sirens, was, discouraged, saint, jerome, who, produced, the, latin, vulgate, version, of, the, bible, used, the, word, sirens, to, translate, hebrew, tann, m, jackals, in, the, book, of, isaiah, 13, 22, and, also, to, translate, a, word, for, owls, in, the, book, of, jeremiah, 50, 39, the, siren, is, allegorically, described, as, a, beautiful, courtesan, or, prostitute, who, sings, pleasant, melody, to, men, and, is, symbolic, vice, of, pleasure, in, the, preaching, of, clement, of, alexandria, 2nd, century, later, writers, such, as, ambrose, 4th, century, reiterated, the, notion, that, the, siren, stood, as, symbol, or, allegory, for, worldly, temptations, and, not, an, endorsement, of, the, greek, myth, the, early, christian, euhemerist, interpretation, of, mythologized, human, beings, received, a, long, lasting, boost, from, the, etymologiae, by, isidore, of, seville, c, 560, 636, they, imagine, that, there, were, three, sirens, part, virgins, part, birds, with, wings, and, claws, one, of, them, sang, another, played, the, flute, the, third, the, lyre, they, drew, sailors, decoyed, by, song, to, shipwreck, according, to, the, truth, however, they, were, prostitutes, who, led, travelers, down, to, poverty, and, were, said, to, impose, shipwreck, on, them, they, had, wings, and, claws, because, love, flies, and, wounds, they, are, said, to, have, stayed, in, the, waves, because, a, wave, created, venus, the, siren, and, the, onocentaur, two, hybrid, creatures, appear, as, the, subject, of, a, single, chapter, in, the, physiologus, as, they, appear, together, in, the, septuagint, translation, of, the, aforementioned, isaiah, 13, 21, 22, and, 34, 14, they, also, appear, together, in, some, latin, bestiaries, of, the, first, family, subgroup, called, b, isidore, b, is, the, siren, s, bird, like, description, from, classical, sources, was, retained, in, the, latin, version, of, the, physiologus, 6th, century, and, a, number, of, subsequent, bestiaries, into, the, 13th, century, but, at, some, time, during, the, interim, the, mermaid, shape, was, introduced, to, this, body, of, works, the, siren, was, illustrated, as, a, woman, fish, mermaid, in, the, bern, physiologus, dated, to, the, mid, 9th, century, even, though, this, contradicted, the, accompanying, text, which, described, it, as, avian, an, english, made, latin, bestiary, dated, 1220, 1250, also, depicted, a, group, of, sirens, as, mermaids, with, fishtails, swimming, in, the, sea, even, though, the, text, stated, they, resembled, winged, fowl, volatilis, habet, figuram, down, to, their, feet, illustrating, the, siren, as, a, pure, mermaid, became, commonplace, in, the, second, family, bestiaries, and, she, was, shown, holding, a, musical, instrument, in, the, classical, tradition, but, also, sometimes, holding, apparently, an, eel, fish, an, example, of, the, siren, mermaid, holding, such, a, fish, is, found, in, one, of, the, earlier, codices, in, this, group, dated, the, late, 12th, century, a, counterexample, is, also, given, where, the, illustrated, sirens, group, of, three, are, bird, like, conforming, to, the, text, the, siren, was, sometimes, drawn, as, a, hybrid, with, a, human, torso, a, fish, like, lower, body, and, bird, like, wings, and, feet, while, in, the, harley, 3244, cf, fig, top, right, the, wings, sprout, from, around, the, shoulders, in, other, hybrid, types, the, style, places, the, siren, s, wings, hanging, at, the, waist, also, a, siren, may, be, holding, a, comb, or, a, mirror, thus, the, comb, and, mirror, which, are, now, emblematic, of, mermaids, across, europe, derive, from, the, bestiaries, that, describe, the, siren, as, a, vain, creature, requiring, those, accoutrements, later, bestiary, texts, appeared, which, were, modified, to, accommodate, the, artistic, conventions, it, is, explained, that, the, siren, s, other, part, may, be, like, fish, or, like, bird, in, guillaume, le, clerc, s, old, french, verse, bestiary, 1210, or, 1211, as, well, as, philippe, de, thaun, s, anglo, norman, verse, bestiary, c, 1121, 1139, there, also, appeared, medieval, works, that, conflated, sirens, with, mermaids, while, citing, physiologus, as, their, source, italian, poet, dante, alighieri, depicts, a, siren, in, canto, 19, of, purgatorio, the, second, canticle, of, the, divine, comedy, here, the, pilgrim, dreams, of, a, female, that, is, described, as, stuttering, cross, eyed, and, crooked, on, her, feet, with, stunted, hands, and, pallid, in, color, it, is, not, until, the, pilgrim, gazes, upon, her, that, she, is, turned, desirable, and, is, revealed, by, herself, to, be, a, siren, this, siren, then, claims, that, she, turned, ulysses, from, his, course, desirous, of, my, song, and, whoever, becomes, used, to, me, rarely, leaves, me, so, wholly, do, i, satisfy, him, given, that, dante, did, not, have, access, to, the, odyssey, the, siren, s, claim, that, she, turned, ulysses, from, his, course, is, inherently, false, because, the, sirens, in, the, odyssey, do, not, manage, to, turn, ulysses, from, his, path, ulysses, and, his, men, were, warned, by, circe, and, prepared, for, their, encounter, by, stuffing, their, ears, full, of, wax, except, for, ulysses, who, wishes, to, be, bound, to, the, ship, s, mast, as, he, wants, to, hear, the, siren, s, song, scholars, claim, that, dante, may, have, misinterpreted, the, siren, s, claim, from, an, episode, in, cicero, s, de, finibus, the, pilgrim, s, dream, comes, to, an, end, when, a, lady, holy, and, quick, who, had, not, yet, been, present, before, suddenly, appears, and, says, o, virgil, virgil, who, is, this, virgil, the, pilgrim, s, guide, then, steps, forward, and, tears, the, clothes, from, the, siren, s, belly, which, awakened, me, with, the, stench, that, issued, from, it, this, marks, ending, the, encounter, between, the, pilgrim, and, the, siren, in, geoffrey, of, monmouth, s, historia, regum, britanniae, c, 1136, brutus, of, troy, encounters, sirens, at, the, pillars, of, hercules, on, his, way, to, britain, to, fulfil, a, prophecy, that, he, will, establish, an, empire, there, the, sirens, surround, and, nearly, overturn, his, ships, until, brutus, escapes, to, the, tyrrhenian, sea, by, the, time, of, the, renaissance, female, court, musicians, known, as, courtesans, filled, the, role, of, an, unmarried, companion, and, musical, performances, by, unmarried, women, could, be, seen, as, immoral, seen, as, a, creature, who, could, control, a, man, s, reason, female, singers, became, associated, with, the, mythological, figure, of, the, siren, who, usually, took, a, half, human, half, animal, form, somewhere, on, the, cusp, between, nature, and, culture, leonardo, da, vinci, wrote, of, them, in, his, notebooks, stating, the, siren, sings, so, sweetly, that, she, lulls, the, mariners, to, sleep, then, she, climbs, upon, the, ships, and, kills, the, sleeping, mariners, however, in, the, 17th, century, some, jesuit, writers, began, to, assert, their, actual, existence, including, cornelius, a, lapide, who, said, of, woman, her, glance, is, that, of, the, fabled, basilisk, her, voice, a, siren, s, voice, with, her, voice, she, enchants, with, her, beauty, she, deprives, of, reason, voice, and, sight, alike, deal, destruction, and, death, antonio, de, lorea, also, argued, for, their, existence, and, athanasius, kircher, argued, that, compartments, must, have, been, built, for, them, aboard, noah, s, ark, charles, burney, expounded, c, 1789, in, a, general, history, of, music, the, name, according, to, bochart, who, derives, it, from, the, phoenician, implies, a, songstress, hence, it, is, probable, that, in, ancient, times, there, may, have, been, excellent, singers, but, of, corrupt, morals, on, the, coast, of, sicily, who, by, seducing, voyagers, gave, rise, to, this, fable, john, lempri, re, in, his, classical, dictionary, 1827, wrote, some, suppose, that, the, sirens, were, a, number, of, lascivious, women, in, sicily, who, prostituted, themselves, to, strangers, and, made, them, forget, their, pursuits, while, drowned, in, unlawful, pleasures, the, etymology, of, bochart, who, deduces, the, name, from, a, phoenician, term, denoting, a, songstress, favors, the, explanation, given, of, the, fable, by, damm, this, distinguished, critic, makes, the, sirens, to, have, been, excellent, singers, and, divesting, the, fables, respecting, them, of, all, their, terrific, features, he, supposes, that, by, the, charms, of, music, and, song, they, detained, travellers, and, made, them, altogether, forgetful, of, their, native, land, the, french, impressionist, composer, claude, debussy, composed, the, orchestral, work, nocturnes, in, which, the, third, movement, sir, nes, depicts, sirens, according, to, debussy, sir, nes, depicts, the, sea, and, its, countless, rhythms, and, presently, amongst, the, waves, silvered, by, the, moonlight, is, heard, the, mysterious, song, of, the, sirens, as, they, laugh, and, pass, on, in, 1911, french, composer, lili, boulanger, composed, les, sir, nes, for, mezzo, soprano, soloist, choir, and, piano, contemporary, british, composer, and, former, child, prodigy, alma, deutscher, composed, waltz, of, the, sirens, an, orchestral, work, based, on, the, mythology, creature, english, artist, william, etty, portrayed, the, sirens, as, young, women, in, fully, human, form, in, his, 1837, painting, the,
