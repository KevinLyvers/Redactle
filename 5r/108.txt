repetitious, recitation, of, prayers, and, holy, names, and, silent, abiding, in, the, presence, of, god, asian, meditative, techniques, have, spread, to, other, cultures, where, they, have, found, application, in, non, spiritual, contexts, such, as, business, and, health, meditation, may, significantly, reduce, stress, fear, anxiety, depression, and, pain, and, enhance, peace, perception, self, concept, and, well, being, research, is, ongoing, to, better, understand, the, effects, of, meditation, on, health, psychological, neurological, and, cardiovascular, and, other, areas, the, english, meditation, is, derived, from, old, french, meditacioun, in, turn, from, latin, meditatio, from, a, verb, meditari, meaning, to, think, contemplate, devise, ponder, in, the, catholic, tradition, the, use, of, the, term, meditatio, as, part, of, a, formal, stepwise, process, of, meditation, goes, back, to, at, least, the, 12th, century, monk, guigo, ii, before, which, the, greek, word, theoria, was, used, for, the, same, purpose, apart, from, its, historical, usage, the, term, meditation, was, introduced, as, a, translation, for, eastern, spiritual, practices, referred, to, as, dhy, na, in, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, which, comes, from, the, sanskrit, root, dhyai, meaning, to, contemplate, or, meditate, the, term, meditation, in, english, may, also, refer, to, practices, from, islamic, sufism, or, other, traditions, such, as, jewish, kabbalah, and, christian, hesychasm, meditation, has, proven, difficult, to, define, as, it, covers, a, wide, range, of, dissimilar, practices, in, different, traditions, and, cultures, in, popular, usage, the, word, meditation, and, the, phrase, meditative, practice, are, often, used, imprecisely, to, designate, practices, found, across, many, cultures, these, can, include, almost, anything, that, is, claimed, to, train, the, attention, of, mind, or, to, teach, calmness, or, compassion, there, remains, no, definition, of, necessary, and, sufficient, criteria, for, meditation, that, has, achieved, widespread, acceptance, within, the, modern, scientific, community, some, of, the, difficulty, in, precisely, defining, meditation, has, been, in, recognizing, the, particularities, of, the, many, various, traditions, and, theories, and, practice, can, differ, within, a, tradition, taylor, noted, that, even, within, a, faith, such, as, hindu, or, buddhist, schools, and, individual, teachers, may, teach, distinct, types, of, meditation, ornstein, noted, that, most, techniques, of, meditation, do, not, exist, as, solitary, practices, but, are, only, artificially, separable, from, an, entire, system, of, practice, and, belief, for, instance, while, monks, meditate, as, part, of, their, everyday, lives, they, also, engage, in, the, codified, rules, and, live, together, in, monasteries, in, specific, cultural, settings, that, go, along, with, their, meditative, practices, dictionaries, give, both, the, original, latin, meaning, of, think, deeply, about, something, as, well, as, the, popular, usages, of, focusing, one, s, mind, for, a, period, of, time, the, act, of, giving, your, attention, to, only, one, thing, either, as, a, religious, activity, or, as, a, way, of, becoming, calm, and, relaxed, and, to, engage, in, mental, exercise, such, as, concentrating, on, one, s, breathing, or, repetition, of, a, mantra, for, the, purpose, of, reaching, a, heightened, level, of, spiritual, awareness, in, modern, psychological, research, meditation, has, been, defined, and, characterized, in, various, ways, many, of, these, emphasize, the, role, of, attention, and, characterize, the, practice, of, meditation, as, attempts, to, detach, from, reflexive, discursive, thinking, not, judging, the, meditation, process, itself, logical, relaxation, to, achieve, a, deeper, more, devout, or, more, relaxed, state, bond, et, al, 2009, identified, criteria, for, defining, a, practice, as, meditation, for, use, in, a, comprehensive, systematic, review, of, the, therapeutic, use, of, meditation, using, a, 5, round, delphi, study, with, a, panel, of, 7, experts, in, meditation, research, who, were, also, trained, in, diverse, but, empirically, highly, studied, eastern, derived, or, clinical, forms, of, meditation, three, main, criteria, as, essential, to, any, meditation, practice, the, use, of, a, defined, technique, logic, relaxation, and, a, self, induced, state, mode, other, criteria, deemed, important, involve, a, state, of, psychophysical, relaxation, the, use, of, a, self, focus, skill, or, anchor, the, presence, of, a, state, of, suspension, of, logical, thought, processes, a, religious, spiritual, philosophical, context, or, a, state, of, mental, silence, it, is, plausible, that, meditation, is, best, thought, of, as, a, natural, category, of, techniques, best, captured, by, family, resemblances, or, by, the, related, prototype, model, of, concepts, several, other, definitions, of, meditation, have, been, used, by, influential, modern, reviews, of, research, on, meditation, across, multiple, traditions, in, the, west, meditation, techniques, have, often, been, classified, in, two, broad, categories, which, in, actual, practice, are, often, combined, focused, or, concentrative, meditation, and, open, monitoring, or, mindfulness, meditation, direction, of, mental, attention, a, practitioner, can, focus, intensively, on, one, particular, object, so, called, concentrative, meditation, on, all, mental, events, that, enter, the, field, of, awareness, so, called, mindfulness, meditation, or, both, specific, focal, points, and, the, field, of, awareness, focused, methods, include, paying, attention, to, the, breath, to, an, idea, or, feeling, such, as, mett, loving, kindness, to, a, k, an, or, to, a, mantra, such, as, in, transcendental, meditation, and, single, point, meditation, open, monitoring, methods, include, mindfulness, shikantaza, and, other, awareness, states, another, typology, divides, meditation, approaches, into, concentrative, generative, receptive, and, reflective, practices, the, buddhist, tradition, often, divides, meditative, practice, into, samatha, or, calm, abiding, and, vipassana, insight, mindfulness, of, breathing, a, form, of, focused, attention, calms, down, the, mind, this, calmed, mind, can, then, investigate, the, nature, of, reality, by, monitoring, the, fleeting, and, ever, changing, constituents, of, experience, by, reflective, investigation, or, by, turning, back, the, radiance, focusing, awareness, on, awareness, itself, and, discerning, the, true, nature, of, mind, as, awareness, itself, matko, and, sedlmeier, 2019, call, into, question, the, common, division, into, focused, attention, and, open, monitoring, practices, they, argue, for, two, orthogonal, dimensions, along, which, meditation, techniques, could, be, classified, namely, activation, and, amount, of, body, orientation, proposing, seven, clusters, of, techniques, mindful, observation, body, centered, meditation, visual, concentration, contemplation, affect, centered, meditation, mantra, meditation, and, meditation, with, movement, jonathan, shear, argues, that, transcendental, meditation, is, an, automatic, self, transcending, technique, different, from, focused, attention, and, open, monitoring, in, this, kind, of, practice, there, is, no, attempt, to, sustain, any, particular, condition, at, all, practices, of, this, kind, once, started, are, reported, to, automatically, transcend, their, own, activity, and, disappear, to, be, started, up, again, later, if, appropriate, yet, shear, also, states, that, automatic, self, transcending, also, applies, to, the, way, other, techniques, such, as, from, zen, and, qigong, are, practiced, by, experienced, meditators, once, they, had, become, effortless, and, automatic, through, years, of, practice, asanas, or, body, postures, such, as, padmasana, full, lotus, half, lotus, cross, legged, sitting, seiza, and, kneeling, positions, are, popular, meditative, postures, in, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, although, other, postures, such, as, sitting, supine, lying, and, standing, are, also, used, meditation, is, also, sometimes, done, while, walking, known, as, kinhin, while, doing, a, simple, task, mindfully, known, as, samu, or, while, lying, down, known, as, shavasana, the, transcendental, meditation, technique, recommends, practice, of, 20, minutes, twice, per, day, some, techniques, suggest, less, time, especially, when, starting, meditation, and, richard, davidson, has, quoted, research, saying, benefits, can, be, achieved, with, a, practice, of, only, 8, minutes, per, day, research, shows, improvement, in, meditation, time, with, simple, oral, and, video, training, some, meditators, practice, for, much, longer, particularly, when, on, a, course, or, retreat, some, meditators, find, practice, best, in, the, hours, before, dawn, some, religions, have, traditions, of, using, prayer, beads, as, tools, in, devotional, meditation, most, prayer, beads, and, christian, rosaries, consist, of, pearls, or, beads, linked, together, by, a, thread, the, roman, catholic, rosary, is, a, string, of, beads, containing, five, sets, with, ten, small, beads, eastern, and, oriental, orthodox, have, traditions, of, using, prayer, ropes, called, comboschini, or, meqetaria, as, an, aid, to, prayerful, meditation, the, hindu, japa, mala, has, 108, beads, the, figure, 108, in, itself, having, spiritual, significance, as, the, energy, of, the, sounds, equivalates, to, om, as, well, as, those, used, in, gaudiya, vaishnavism, the, hare, krishna, tradition, and, jainism, buddhist, prayer, beads, also, have, 108, beads, but, hold, a, different, meaning, in, buddhism, there, are, 108, human, passions, that, impede, enlightenment, each, bead, is, counted, once, as, a, person, recites, a, mantra, until, the, person, has, gone, all, the, way, around, the, mala, the, muslim, misbaha, has, 99, beads, there, is, also, quite, a, variance, when, it, comes, to, materials, used, for, beads, beads, made, from, seeds, of, rudraksha, trees, are, considered, sacred, by, devotees, of, shiva, while, followers, of, vishnu, revere, the, wood, that, comes, from, the, tulsi, plant, also, known, as, holy, basil, the, buddhist, literature, has, many, stories, of, enlightenment, being, attained, through, disciples, being, struck, by, their, masters, according, to, t, griffith, foulk, the, encouragement, stick, was, an, integral, part, of, the, zen, practice, in, the, rinzai, monastery, where, i, trained, in, the, mid, 1970s, according, to, an, unspoken, etiquette, monks, who, were, sitting, earnestly, and, well, were, shown, respect, by, being, hit, vigorously, and, often, those, known, as, laggards, were, ignored, by, the, hall, monitor, or, given, little, taps, if, they, requested, to, be, hit, nobody, asked, about, the, meaning, of, the, stick, nobody, explained, and, nobody, ever, complained, about, its, use, neuroscientist, and, long, time, meditator, richard, davidson, has, expressed, the, view, that, having, a, narrative, can, help, the, maintenance, of, daily, practice, for, instance, he, himself, prostrates, to, the, teachings, and, meditates, not, primarily, for, my, benefit, but, for, the, benefit, of, others, the, history, of, meditation, is, intimately, bound, up, with, the, religious, context, within, which, it, was, practiced, rossano, suggested, that, the, emergence, of, the, capacity, for, focused, attention, an, element, of, many, methods, of, meditation, may, have, contributed, to, the, latest, phases, of, human, biological, evolution, some, of, the, earliest, references, to, meditation, as, well, as, proto, samkhya, are, found, in, the, upanishads, of, india, according, to, wynne, the, earliest, clear, references, to, meditation, are, in, the, middle, upanishads, and, the, mahabharata, including, the, bhagavad, gita, according, to, gavin, flood, the, earlier, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, is, describing, meditation, when, it, states, that, having, become, calm, and, concentrated, one, perceives, the, self, tman, within, oneself, bu, 4, 4, 23, there, are, many, schools, and, styles, of, meditation, within, hinduism, in, pre, modern, and, traditional, hinduism, yoga, and, dhyana, are, practised, to, recognize, pure, awareness, or, pure, consciousness, undisturbed, by, the, workings, of, the, mind, as, one, s, eternal, self, in, advaita, vedanta, jivatman, individual, self, is, recognized, as, illusory, and, in, reality, identical, with, the, omnipresent, and, non, dual, tman, brahman, in, the, dualistic, yoga, school, and, samkhya, the, self, is, called, purusha, a, pure, consciousness, undisturbed, by, prakriti, nature, depending, on, the, tradition, the, liberative, event, is, named, moksha, vimukti, or, kaivalya, one, of, the, most, influential, texts, of, classical, hindu, yoga, is, pata, jali, s, yoga, sutras, c, 400, ce, a, text, associated, with, yoga, and, samkhya, and, influenced, by, buddhism, which, outlines, eight, limbs, leading, to, kaivalya, aloneness, or, inner, awareness, the, first, four, known, as, the, outer, limbs, include, ethical,

like, the, hatha, yoga, pradipika, the, development, of, bhakti, yoga, as, a, major, form, of, meditation, and, tantra, another, important, hindu, yoga, text, is, the, yoga, yajnavalkya, which, makes, use, of, hatha, yoga, and, vedanta, philosophy, the, bhagavata, purana, emphasizes, that, mantra, meditation, is, a, key, practice, for, achieving, liberation, practitioners, can, achieve, a, direct, vision, of, the, divine, the, text, integrates, both, vedic, and, tantric, elements, where, mantras, are, not, only, seen, as, sacred, sounds, but, as, embodiment, of, the, deity, this, approach, reflects, a, shift, from, the, impersonal, meditation, on, the, sound, form, of, brahman, om, in, the, upanishads, to, a, personal, devotional, focus, on, krishna, in, the, bhagavata, purana, jainism,

and, breath, meditation, have, been, preserved, and, transmitted, in, almost, all, buddhist, traditions, through, buddhist, texts, like, the, satipatthana, sutta, and, the, dhyana, sutras, and, through, oral, teacher, student, transmissions, these, ancient, practices, are, supplemented, with, various, distinct, interpretations, of, and, developments, in, these, practices, the, therav, da, tradition, stresses, the, development, of, samatha, and, vipassana, postulating, over, fifty, methods, for, developing, mindfulness, based, on, the, satipatthana, sutta, and, forty, for, developing, concentration, based, on, the, visuddhimagga, the, tibetan, tradition, incorporated, sarvastivada, and, tantric, practices, wedded, with, madhyamaka, philosophy, and, developed, thousands, of,

equated, with, buddha, nature, the, silk, road, transmission, of, buddhism, introduced, buddhist, meditation, to, other, asian, countries, reaching, china, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, and, japan, in, the, 6th, century, ce, in, the, modern, era, buddhist, meditation, techniques, have, become, popular, in, the, wider, world, due, to, the, influence, of, buddhist, modernism, on, asian, buddhism, and, western, lay, interest, in, zen, and, the, vipassana, movement, with, many, non, buddhists, taking, up, meditative, practices, the, modernized, concept, of, mindfulness, based, on, the, buddhist, term, sati, and, related, meditative, practices, have, in, turn, led, to, mindfulness, based, therapies, dhyana, while, often, presented, as, a, form, of, focused, attention, or, concentration, as, in, buddhagosa, s, theravada, classic, the, visuddhimagga, path, of, purification, 5th, c, ce, according, to, a, number, contemporary, scholars, and, scholar, practitioners, it, is, actually, a, description, of, the, development, of, perfected, equanimity, and, mindfulness, apparently, induced, by, satipatthana, an, open, monitoring, of, the, breath, without, trying, to, regulate, it, the, same, description, in, a, different, formula, can, be, found, in, the, bojjhanga, the, seven, factors, of, awakening, and, may, therefore, refer, to, the, core, program, of, early, buddhist, bhavana, according, to, vetter, dhyana, seems, to, be, a, natural, development, from, the, sense, restraint, and, moral, constrictions, prescribed, by, the, buddhist, tradition, the, buddha, identified, two, paramount, mental, qualities, that, arise, from, wholesome, meditative, practice, or, bhavana, namely, samatha, calm, serenity, tranquility, and, vipassana, insight, as, the, developing, tradition, started, to, emphasize, the, value, of, liberating, insight, and, dhyana, came, to, be, understood, as, concentration, samatha, and, vipassana, were, understood, as, two, distinct, meditative, techniques, in, this, understanding, samatha, steadies, composes, unifies, and, concentrates, the, mind, while, vipassana, enables, one, to, see, explore, and, discern, formations, conditioned, phenomena, based, on, the, five, aggregates, according, to, this, understanding, which, is, central, to, theravada, orthodoxy, but, also, plays, a, role, in, tibetan, buddhism, through, the, meditative, development, of, serenity, one, is, able, to, weaken, the, obscuring, hindrances, and, bring, the, mind, to, a, collected, pliant, and, still, state, samadhi, this, quality, of, mind, then, supports, the, development, of, insight, and, wisdom, praj, which, is, the, quality, of, mind, that, can, clearly, see, vi, passana, the, nature, of, phenomena, what, exactly, is, to, be, seen, varies, within, the, buddhist, traditions, in, theravada, all, phenomena, are, to, be, seen, as, impermanent, suffering, not, self, and, empty, when, this, happens, one, develops, dispassion, viraga, for, all, phenomena, including, all, negative, qualities, and, hindrances, and, lets, them, go, it, is, through, the, release, of, the, hindrances, and, ending, of, craving, through, the, meditative, development, of, insight, that, one, gains, liberation, in, sikhism, simran, meditation, and, good, deeds, are, both, necessary, to, achieve, the, devotee, s, spiritual, goals, without, good, deeds,

as, some, type, of, meditative, practice, genesis, 24, 63, similarly, there, are, indications, throughout, the, tanakh, the, hebrew, bible, that, the, prophets, meditated, in, the, old, testament,

espouse, a, wide, range, of, meditative, practices, often, associated, with, the, cultivation, of, kavanah, or, intention, the, first, layer, of, rabbinic, law, the, mishnah, describes, ancient, sages, waiting, for, an, hour, before, their, prayers, in, order, to, direct, their, hearts, to, the, omnipresent, one, mishnah, berakhot, 5, 1, other, early, rabbinic, texts, include, instructions,

and, some, jews, have, described, kabbalah, as, an, inherently, meditative, field, of, study, kabbalistic, meditation, often, involves, the, mental, visualization, of, the, supernal, realms, aryeh, kaplan, has, argued, that, the, ultimate, purpose, of, kabbalistic, meditation, is, to, understand, and, cleave, to, the, divine, meditation, has, been, of, interest, to, a, wide, variety, of, modern, jews, in, modern, jewish, practice, one, of, the, best, known, meditative, practices, is, called, hitbodedut, alternatively, transliterated, as, hisbodedus, and, is, explained, in, kabbalistic, hasidic, and, mussar, writings, especially, the, hasidic, method, of, rabbi, nachman, of, breslav, the, word, derives, from, the, hebrew, word, boded, meaning, the, state, of, being, alone, another, hasidic, system, is, the, habad, method, of, hisbonenus, related, to, the, sephirah, of, binah, hebrew, for, understanding, this, practice, is, the, analytical, reflective, process, of, making, oneself, understand, a, mystical, concept, well, that, follows, and, internalises, its, study, in, hasidic, writings, the, musar, movement, founded, by, rabbi, israel, salanter, in, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, emphasized, meditative, practices, of, introspection, and, visualization, that, could, help, to, improve, moral, character, conservative, rabbi, alan, lew, has, emphasized, meditation, playing, an, important, role, in, the, process, of, teshuvah, repentance, jewish, buddhists, have, adopted, buddhist, styles, of, meditation, christian, meditation, is, a, term, for, a, form, of, prayer, in, which, a, structured, attempt, is, made, to, get, in, touch, with, and, deliberately, reflect, upon, the, revelations, of, god, in, the, roman, empire, by, 20, bce, philo, of, alexandria, had, written, on, some, form, of, spiritual, exercises, involving, attention, prosoche, and, concentration, and, by, the, 3rd, century, plotinus, had, developed, meditative, techniques, the, word, meditation, comes, from, the, latin, word, meditatum, which, means, to, concentrate, or, to, ponder, monk, guigo, ii, introduced, this, terminology, for, the, first, time, in, the, 12th, century, ad, christian, meditation, is, the, process, of, deliberately, focusing, on, specific, thoughts, e, g, a, biblical, scene, involving, jesus, and, the, virgin, mary, and, reflecting, on, their, meaning, in, the, context, of, the, love, of, god, christian, meditation, is, sometimes, taken, to, mean, the, middle, level, in, a, broad, three, stage, characterization, of, prayer, it, then, involves, more, reflection, than, first, level, vocal, prayer, but, is, more, structured, than, the, multiple, layers, of, contemplation, in, christianity, between, the, 10th, and, 14th, centuries, hesychasm, was, developed, particularly, on, mount, athos, in, greece, and, involves, the, repetition, of, the, jesus, prayer, interactions, with, indians, or, the, sufis, may, have, influenced, the, eastern, christian, meditation, approach, to, hesychasm, but, this, is, unproven, western, christian, meditation, contrasts, with, most, other, approaches, in, that, it, does, not, involve, the, repetition, of, any, phrase, or, action, and, requires, no, specific, posture, western, christian, meditation, progressed, from, the, 6th, century, practice, of, bible, reading, among, benedictine, monks, called, lectio, divina, i, e, divine, reading, its, four, formal, steps, as, a, ladder, were, defined, by, the, monk, guigo, ii, in, the, 12th, century, with, the, latin, terms, lectio, meditatio, oratio, and, contemplatio, i, e, read, ponder, pray, contemplate, western, christian, meditation, was, further, developed, by, saints, such, as, ignatius, of, loyola, and, teresa, of, avila, in, the, 16th, century, on, 28, april, 2021, pope, francis, in, an, address, to, the, general, audience, said, that, meditation, is, a, need, for, everyone, he, noted, that, the, term, meditation, has, had, many, meanings, throughout, history, and, that, the, ancients, used, to, say, that, the, organ, of, prayer, is, the, heart, in, catholic, christianity, the, rosary, is, a, devotion, for, the, meditation, of, the, mysteries, of, jesus, and, mary, the, gentle, repetition, of, its, prayers, makes, it, an, excellent, means, to, moving, into, deeper, meditation, it, gives, us, an, opportunity, to, open, ourselves, to, god, s, word, to, refine, our, interior, gaze, by, turning, our, minds, to, the, life, of, christ, the, first, principle, is, that, meditation, is, learned, through, practice, many, people, who, practice, rosary, meditation, begin, very, simply, and, gradually, develop, a, more, sophisticated, meditation, the, meditator, learns, to, hear, an, interior, voice, the, voice, of, god, similarly, the, chotki, of, the, eastern, orthodox, denomination, the, wreath, of, christ, of, the, lutheran, faith, and, the, anglican, prayer, beads, of, the, episcopalian, tradition, are, used, for, christian, prayer, and, meditation, according, to, edmund, p, clowney, christian, meditation, contrasts, with, eastern, forms, of, meditation, as, radically, as, the, portrayal, of, god, the, father, in, the, bible, contrasts, with, depictions, of, krishna, or, brahman, in, indian, teachings, unlike, some, eastern, styles, most, styles, of, christian, meditation, do, not, rely, on, the, repeated, use, of, mantras, and, yet, are, also, intended, to, stimulate, thought, and, deepen, meaning, christian, meditation, aims, to, heighten, the, personal, relationship, based, on, the, love, of, god, that, marks, christian, communion, in, aspects, of, christian, meditation, the, catholic, church, warned, of, potential, incompatibilities, in, mixing, christian, and, eastern, styles, of, meditation, in, 2003, in, a, christian, reflection, on, the, new, age, the, vatican, announced, that, the, church, avoids, any, concept, that, is, close, to, those, of, the, new, age, dhikr, zikr, is, a, type, of, meditation, within, islam, meaning, remembering, and, mentioning, god, which, involves, the, repetition, of, the, 99, names, of, god, since, the, 8th, or, 9th, century, it, is, interpreted, in, different, meditative, techniques, in, sufism, or, islamic, mysticism, this, became, one, of, the, essential, elements, of, sufism, as, it, was, systematized, traditionally, it, is, juxtaposed, with, fikr, thinking, which, leads, to, knowledge, by, the, 12th, century, the, practice, of, sufism, included, specific, meditative, techniques, and, its, followers, practiced, breathing, controls, and, the, repetition, of, holy, words, sufism, uses, a, meditative, procedure, like, buddhist, concentration, involving, high, intensity, and, sharply, focused, introspection, in, the, oveyssi, shahmaghsoudi, sufi, order, for, example, muraqabah, takes, the, form, of, tamarkoz, concentration, in, persian, tafakkur, or, tadabbur, in, sufism, literally, means, reflection, upon, the, universe, this, is, considered, to, permit, access, to, a, form, of, cognitive, and, emotional, development, that, can, emanate, only, from, the, higher, level, i, e, from, god, the, sensation, of, receiving, divine, inspiration, awakens, and, liberates, both, heart, and, intellect, permitting, such, inner, growth, that, the, apparently, mundane, actually, takes, on, the, quality, of, the, infinite, muslim, teachings, embrace, life, as, a, test, of, one, s, submission, to, god, dervishes, of, certain, sufi, orders, practice, whirling, a, form, of, physically, active, meditation, in, the, teachings, of, the, bah, faith, which, derives, from, an, islamic, context, but, is, universalist, in, orientation, meditation, is, a, primary, tool, for, spiritual, development, involving, reflection, on, the, words, of, god, while, prayer, and, meditation, are, linked, where, meditation, happens, generally, in, a, prayerful, attitude, prayer, is, seen, specifically, as, turning, toward, god, and, meditation, is, seen, as, a, communion, with, one, s, self, where, one, focuses, on, the, divine, in, bah, teachings, the, purpose, of, meditation, is, to, strengthen, one, s, understanding, of, the, words, of, god, and, to, make, one, s, soul, more, susceptible, to, their, potentially, transformative, power, more, receptive, to, the, need, for, both, prayer, and, meditation, to, bring, about, and, maintain, a, spiritual, communion, with, god, bah, u, ll, h, the, founder, of, the, religion, never, specified, any, particular, form, of, meditation, and, thus, each, person, is, free, to, choose, their, own, form, however, he, did, state, that, bah, s, should, read, a, passage, of, the, bah, writings, twice, a, day, once, in, the, morning, and, once, in, the, evening, and, meditate, on, it, he, also, encouraged, people, to, reflect, on, one, s, actions, and, worth, at, the, end, of, each, day, during, the, nineteen, day, fast, a, period, of, the, year, during, which, bah, s, adhere, to, a, sunrise, to, sunset, fast, they, meditate, and, pray, to, reinvigorate, their, spiritual, forces, meditation, has, spread, in, the, west, since, the, late, 19th, century, accompanying, increased, travel, and, communication, among, cultures, worldwide, most, prominent, has, been, the, transmission, of, asian, derived, practices, to, the, west, in, addition, interest, in, some, western, based, meditative, practices, has, been, revived, and, these, have, been, disseminated, to, a, limited, extent, to, asian, countries, ideas, about, eastern, meditation, had, begun, seeping, into, american, popular, culture, even, before, the, american, revolution, through, the, various, sects, of, european, occult, christianity, and, such, ideas, came, pouring, in, during, the, era, of, the, transcendentalists, especially, between, the, 1840s, and, the, 1880s, the, following, decades, saw, further, spread, of, these, ideas, to, america, the, world, parliament, of, religions, held, in, chicago, in, 1893, was, the, landmark, event, that, increased, western, awareness, of, meditation, this, was, the, first, time, that, western, audiences, on, american, soil, received, asian, spiritual, teachings, from, asians, themselves, thereafter, swami, vivekananda, various, vedanta, ashrams, anagarika, dharmapala, lectured, at, harvard, on, theravada, buddhist, meditation, in, 1904, abdul, baha, the, us, teaching, the, principles, of, bahai, and, soyen, shaku, toured, in, 1907, teaching, zen, more, recently, in, the, 1960s, another, surge, in, western, interest, in, meditative, practices, began, the, rise, of, communist, political, power, in, asia, led, to, many, asian, spiritual, teachers, taking, refuge, in, western, countries, oftentimes, as, refugees, in, addition, to, spiritual, forms, of, meditation, secular, forms, of, meditation, have, taken, root, rather, than, focusing, on, spiritual, growth, secular, meditation, emphasizes, stress, reduction, relaxation, and, self, improvement, the, 2012, us, national, health, interview, survey, of, 34, 525, subjects, found, that, 8, of, us, adults, used, meditation, with, lifetime, and, 12, month, prevalence, of, meditation, use, of, 5, 2, and, 4, 1, respectively, meditation, use, among, workers, was, 10, up, from, 8, in, 2002, mantra, meditation, with, the, use, of, a, japa, mala, and, especially, with, focus, on, the, hare, krishna, maha, mantra, is, a, central, practice, of, the, gaudiya, vaishnava, faith, tradition, and, the, international, society, for, krishna, consciousness, also, known, as, the, hare, krishna, movement, other, popular, new, religious, movements, include, the, ramakrishna, mission, vedanta, society, divine, light, mission, chinmaya, mission, osho, sahaja, yoga, transcendental, meditation, oneness, university, brahma, kumaris, vihangam, yoga, and, heartfulness, meditation, sahaj, marg, new, age, meditations, are, often, influenced, by, eastern, philosophy, mysticism, yoga, hinduism, and, buddhism, yet, may, contain, some, degree, of, western, influence, in, the, west, meditation, found, its, mainstream, roots, through, the, social, revolution, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, when, many, of, the, youth, of, the, day, rebelled, against, traditional, religion, as, a, reaction, against, what, some, perceived, as, the, failure, of, christianity, to, provide, spiritual, and, ethical, guidance, new, age, meditation, as, practised, by, the, early, hippies, is, regarded, for, its, techniques, of, blanking, out, the, mind, and, releasing, oneself, from, conscious, thinking, this, is, often, aided, by, repetitive, chanting, of, a, mantra, or, focusing, on, an, object, new, age, meditation, evolved, into, a, range, of, purposes, and, practices, from, serenity, and, balance, to, access, to, other, realms, of, consciousness, to, the, concentration, of, energy, in, group, meditation, to, the, supreme, goal, of, samadhi, as, in, the, ancient, yogic, practice, of, meditation, guided, meditation, is, a, form, of, meditation, which, uses, a, number, of, different, techniques, to, achieve, or, enhance, the, meditative, state, it, may, simply, be, meditation, done, under, the, guidance, of, a, trained, practitioner, or, teacher, or, it, may, be, through, the, use, of, imagery, music, and, other, techniques, the, session, can, be, either, in, person, via, media, comprising, music, or, verbal, instruction, or, a, combination, of, both, the, most, common, form, is, a, combination, of, meditation, music, and, receptive, music, therapy, guided, imagery, relaxation, mindfulness, and, journaling, because, of, the, different, combinations, used, under, the, one, term, it, can, be, difficult, to, attribute, positive, or, negative, outcomes, to, any, of, the, various, techniques, furthermore, the, term, is, frequently, used, interchangeably, with, guided, imagery, and, sometimes, with, creative, visualization, in, popular, psychology, and, self, help, literature, it, is, less, commonly, used, in, scholarly, and, scientific, publications, consequently, guided, meditation, cannot, be, understood, as, a, single, technique, but, rather, multiple, techniques, that, are, integral, to, its, practice, guided, meditation, as, an, aggregate, or, synthesis, of, techniques, includes, meditation, music, receptive, music, therapy, guided, imagery, relaxation, meditative, praxis, and, self, reflective, journaling, all, of, which, have, been, shown, to, have, therapeutic, benefits, when, employed, as, an, adjunct, to, primary, strategies, benefits, include, lower, levels, of, stress, reducing, asthmatic, episodes, physical, pain, insomnia, episodic, anger, negative, or, irrational, thinking, and, anxiety, as, well, as, improving, coping, skills, focus, and, a, general, feeling, of, well, being, research, on, the, processes, and, effects, of, meditation, is, a, subfield, of, neurological, research, modern, scientific, techniques, such, as, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, and, electroencephalography, were, used, to, observe, neurological, responses, during, meditation, concerns, have, been, raised, on, the, quality, of, meditation, research, including, the, particular, characteristics, of, individuals, who, tend, to, participate, meditation, lowers, heart, rate, oxygen, consumption, breathing, frequency, stress, hormones, lactate, levels, and, sympathetic, nervous, system, activity, associated, with, the, fight, or, flight, response, along, with, a, modest, decline, in, blood, pressure, however, those, who, have, meditated, for, two, or, three, years, were, found, to, already, have, low, blood, pressure, during, meditation, the, oxygen, consumption, decrease, averages, 10, to, 20, percent, over, the, first, three, minutes, during, sleep, for, example, oxygen, consumption, decreases, around, 8, percent, over, four, or, five, hours, for, meditators, who, have, practiced, for, years, breath, rate, can, drop, to, three, or, four, breaths, per, minute, and, brain, waves, slow, from, the, usual, beta, seen, in, waking, activity, or, alpha, seen, in, normal, relaxation, to, much, slower, delta, and, theta, waves, studies, demonstrate, that, meditation, has, a, moderate, effect, to, reduce, pain, there, is, insufficient, evidence, for, any, effect, of, meditation, on, positive, mood, attention, eating, habits, sleep, or, body, weight, luberto, er, all, 2017, in, a, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, of, the, effects, of, meditation, on, empathy, compassion, and, prosocial, behaviors, found, that, meditation, practices, had, small, to, medium, effects, on, self, reported, and, observable, outcomes, concluding, that, such, practices, can, improve, positive, prosocial, emotions, and, behaviors, however, a, meta, review, published, on, scientific, reports, showed, that, the, evidence, is, very, weak, and, that, the, effects, of, meditation, on, compassion, were, only, significant, when, compared, to, passive, control, groups, suggests, that, other, forms, of, active, interventions, like, watching, a, nature, video, might, produce, similar, outcomes, to, meditation, throughout, east, asia, the, detrimental, and, undesirable, effects, of, incorrect, meditation, and, mindfulness, practice, are, well, documented, due, to, the, long, varied, history, of, cultivation, in, these, fields, many, traditional, herbal, intentional, and, manual, treatments, have, been, prescribed, from, the, past, to, present, day, for, what, is, diagnosed, as, zouhuorumo, chinese, meditation, may, induce, challenging, and, unwanted, experiences, and, adverse, effects, to, physical, and, mental, health, some, of, these, experiences, and, effects, are, documented, in, the, contemplative, traditions, but, can, be, quite, perplexing, and, burdensome, when, the, outcomes, of, meditation, are, expected, to, result, in, more, advantageous, and, beneficial, health, outcomes, than, detrimental, ones, by, extension, this, problem, is, compounded, with, little, or, no, support, or, explanatory, framework, publicly, for, novice, or, laity, that, is, easily, accessible, for, a, practitioner, to, know, when, it, is, appropriate, to, self, manage, or, when, it, is, advisable, to, seek, professional, advice, on, the, adverse, symptomatology, that, may, arise, in, this, field, of, self, cultivation, according, to, farias, et, al, 2020, the, most, common, adverse, effects, are, in, people, with, a, history, of, anxiety, and, depression, other, adverse, psychological, symptoms, may, include, narcissistic, sociopathic, behaviour, and, depersonalization, or, altered, sense, of, self, or, the, world, distorted, emotions, or, thoughts, a, mild, form, of, psychosis, including, auditory, and, visual, hallucinations, in, extreme, cases, in, patients, with, underlying, undiagnosed, or, historical, emotional, conditions, there, have, been, instances, of, self, harm, according, to, schlosser, et, al, 2019, preliminary, findings, suggest, that, their, occurrence, is, highly, dependent, on, a, complex, interaction, of, contextual, factors, for, instance, meditation, related, psychosis, has, been, linked, to, sleep, deprivation, preceding, mental, dispositions, and, meditation, without, sufficient, social, support, or, any, explanatory, framework, however, according, to, farias, et, al, 2020, minor, adverse, effects, have, been, observed, in, individuals, with, no, previous, history, of, mental, health, problems, farias, et, al, 2020, further, note, that, it, is, also, possible, that, participants, predisposed, to, heightened, levels, of, anxiety, and, depression, are, more, likely, to, begin, or, maintain, a, meditation, practice, to, manage, their, symptoms, according, to, farias, et, al, 2020, there, is, a, prevalence, of, 8, 3, adverse, effects, similar, to, those, reported, for, psychotherapy, practice, in, general, schlosser, et, al, 2019, reported, that, of, 1, 232, regular, meditators, with, at, least, two, months, of, meditation, experience, about, a, quarter, reported, having, had, particularly, unpleasant, meditation, related, experiences, which, they, thought, may, have, been, caused, by, their, meditation, practice, meditators, with, high, levels, of, repetitive, negative, thinking, and, those, who, only, engage, in, deconstructive, meditation, vipassana, insight, meditation, were, more, likely, to, report, unpleasant, side, effects, the, appraisal, of, the, experiences, may, be, determined, by, the, framework, used, to, interpret, these, experiences, schlosser, et, al, found, strong, evidence, that, religious, participants, have, lower, odds, of, having, particularly, unpleasant, meditation, related, experiences, and, found, weak, evidence, that, female, participants, were, less, likely, to, have, unpleasant, meditation, related, experiences, and, note, the, importance, of, understanding, when, these, experiences, are, constitutive, elements, of, meditative, practice, rather, than, merely, negative, effects, difficult, experiences, encountered, in, meditation, are, mentioned, in, traditional, sources, and, some, may, be, considered, to, be, an, expected, part, of, the, process, according, to, salguero, problematic, experiences, such, as, strange, sensations, unexplained, pains, psychological, instability, undesired, hallucinations, sexual, anomalies, uncontrollable, behaviors, demonic, possession, suicidality, and, so, forth, seem, to, be, quite, well, known, and, well, documented, across, traditions, the, visuddhimagga, mentions, various, unpleasant, stages, and, possible, unwholesome, or, frightening, visions, are, mentioned, in, practical, insight, meditation, basic, and, progressive, stages, a, practical, manual, on, vipassan, meditation, by, mah, si, say, daw, classical, sources, mention, maky, zen, sickness, chinese, and, japanese, pinyin, ch, nb, ng, r, maji, zenby, and, related, difficulties, such, as, zouhuorumo, fire, possession, and, mojing, demonic, states, traditional, sources, also, precribe, cures, against, these, experiences, for, example, hakuin, ekaku, s, treatment, of, zen, sickness, both, the, soundness, of, the, scientific, foundations, of, mindfulness, and, the, desirability, of, its, social, effects, have, been, questioned, hafenbrack, et, al, 2022, in, a, study, on, mindfulness, with, 1400, participants, found, that, focused, breathing, meditation, can, dampen, the, relationship, between, transgressions, and, the, desire, to, engage, in, reparative, prosocial, behaviors, poullin, et, al, 2021, found, that, mindfulness, can, increase, the, trait, of, selfishness, the, study, consisting, of, two, interrelated, parts, and, totaling, 691, participants, found, that, a, mindfulness, induction, compared, to, a, control, condition, led, to, decreased, prosocial, behavior, this, effect, was, moderated, by, self, construals, such, that, people, with, relatively, independent, self, construals, became, less, prosocial, while, people, with, relatively, interdependent, self, construals, became, more, so, in, the, western, world, where, independent, self, construals, generally, predominate, self, centric, orientated, meditation, may, thus, have, potentially, detrimental, effects, these, new, findings, about, meditations, socially, problematic, effects, imply, that, it, can, be, contraindicated, to, use, meditation, as, a, tool, to, handle, acute, personal, conflicts, or, relational, difficulties, in, the, words, of, andrew, hafenbrack, one, of, the, authors, of, the, study, if, we, artificially, reduce, our, guilt, by, meditating, it, away, we, may, end, up, with, worse, relationships, or, even, fewer, relationships, carl, jung, 1875, 1961, was, an, early, western, explorer, of, eastern, religious, practices, he, clearly, advocated, ways, to, increase, the, conscious, awareness, of, an, individual, yet, he, expressed, some, caution, concerning, a, westerner, s, direct, immersion, in, eastern, practices, without, some, prior, appreciation, of, the, differing, spiritual, and, cultural, contexts, erich, fromm, 1900, 1980, later, explored, spiritual, practices, of, the, east, since, the, 1970s, clinical, psychology, and, psychiatry, have, developed, meditation, techniques, for, numerous, psychological, conditions, mindfulness, practice, is, employed, in, psychology, to, alleviate, mental, and, physical, conditions, such, as, affecting, the, endocrine, system, therefore, reducing, depression, and, helping, to, alleviate, stress, and, anxiety, mindfulness, is, also, used, as, a, form, of, interventional, therapy, in, the, treatment, of, addiction, including, drug, addiction, although, the, quantity, and, quality, of, evidence, based, research, has, been, poor, the, us, national, center, for, complementary, and, integrative, health, states, that, meditation, and, mindfulness, practices, may, have, a, variety, of, health, benefits, and, may, help, people, improve, the, quality, of, their, lives, recent, studies, have, investigated, if, meditation, or, mindfulness, helps, people, manage, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or, symptoms, related, to, withdrawal, from, nicotine, alcohol, or, opioids, however, the, nccic, goes, on, to, caution, that, results, from, the, studies, have, been, difficult, to, analyze, and, may, have, been, interpreted, too, optimistically, a, 2014, review, found, that, practice, of, mindfulness, meditation, for, two, to, six, months, by, people, undergoing, long, term, psychiatric, or, medical, therapy, could, produce, moderate, improvements, in, pain, management, anxiety, depression, in, 2017, the, american, heart, association, issued, a, scientific, statement, that, meditation, may, be, a, reasonable,
