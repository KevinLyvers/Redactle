conservative, judaism, also, known, as, masorti, judaism, hebrew, romanized, yahadut, masortit, is, a, jewish, religious, movement, that, regards, the, authority, of, jewish, law, and, tradition, as, emanating, primarily, from, the, assent, of, the, people, through, the, generations, more, than, from, divine, revelation, it, therefore, views, jewish, law, or, halakha, as, both, binding, and, subject, to, historical, development, the, conservative, rabbinate, employs, modern, historical, critical, research, rather, than, only, traditional, methods, and, sources, and, lends, great, weight, to, its, constituency, when, determining, its, stance, on, matters, of, practice, the, movement, considers, its, approach, as, the, authentic, and, most, appropriate, continuation, of, halakhic, discourse, maintaining, both, fealty, to, received, forms, and, flexibility, in, their, interpretation, it, also, eschews, strict, theological, definitions, lacking, a, consensus, in, matters, of, faith, and, allowing, great, pluralism, while, regarding, itself, as, the, heir, of, rabbi, zecharias, frankel, s, 19th, century, positive, historical, school, in, europe, conservative, judaism, fully, institutionalized, only, in, the, united, states, during, the, mid, 20th, century, its, largest, center, is, in, north, america, where, its, main, congregational, arm, is, the, united, synagogue, of, conservative, judaism, and, the, new, york, based, jewish, theological, seminary, of, america, operates, as, its, largest, rabbinic, seminary, globally, affiliated, communities, are, united, within, the, umbrella, organization, masorti, olami, conservative, judaism, is, the, third, largest, jewish, religious, movement, worldwide, estimated, to, represent, close, to, 1, 1, million, people, including, over, 600, 000, registered, adult, congregants, and, many, non, member, identifiers, conservative, judaism, from, its, earliest, stages, was, marked, by, ambivalence, and, ambiguity, in, all, matters, theological, rabbi, zecharias, frankel, considered, its, intellectual, progenitor, believed, the, very, notion, of, theology, was, alien, to, traditional, judaism, he, was, often, accused, of, obscurity, on, the, subject, by, his, opponents, both, reform, and, orthodox, the, american, movement, largely, espoused, a, similar, approach, and, its, leaders, mostly, avoided, the, field, only, in, 1985, did, a, course, about, conservative, theology, open, in, the, jewish, theological, seminary, of, america, jts, the, hitherto, sole, major, attempt, to, define, a, clear, credo, was, made, in, 1988, with, the, statement, of, principles, emet, ve, emunah, truth, and, belief, formulated, and, issued, by, the, leadership, council, of, conservative, judaism, the, introduction, stated, that, lack, of, definition, was, useful, in, the, past, but, a, need, to, articulate, one, now, arose, the, platform, provided, many, statements, citing, key, concepts, such, as, god, revelation, and, election, but, also, acknowledged, that, a, variety, of, positions, and, convictions, existed, within, its, ranks, eschewing, strict, delineation, of, principles, and, often, expressing, conflicting, views, in, a, 1999, special, edition, of, conservative, judaism, dedicated, to, the, matter, leading, rabbis, elliot, n, dorff, and, gordon, tucker, stated, that, the, great, diversity, within, the, movement, makes, the, creation, of, a, theological, vision, shared, by, all, neither, possible, nor, desirable, conservative, judaism, largely, upholds, the, theistic, notion, of, a, personal, god, emet, ve, emunah, stated, that, we, affirm, our, faith, in, god, as, the, creator, and, governor, of, the, universe, his, power, called, the, world, into, being, his, wisdom, and, goodness, guide, its, destiny, concurrently, the, platform, also, noted, that, his, nature, was, elusive, and, subject, to, many, options, of, belief, a, naturalistic, conception, of, divinity, regarding, it, as, inseparable, from, the, mundane, world, once, had, an, important, place, within, the, movement, especially, represented, by, mordecai, kaplan, after, kaplan, s, reconstructionism, fully, coalesced, into, an, independent, movement, these, views, were, marginalized, a, similarly, inconclusive, position, is, expressed, toward, other, precepts, most, theologians, adhere, to, the, immortality, of, the, soul, but, while, references, to, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, are, maintained, english, translations, of, the, prayers, obscure, the, issue, in, emet, it, was, stated, that, death, is, not, tantamount, to, the, end, of, one, s, personality, relating, to, the, messianic, ideal, the, movement, rephrased, most, petitions, for, the, restoration, of, the, sacrifices, into, past, tense, rejecting, a, renewal, of, animal, offerings, though, not, opposing, a, return, to, zion, and, even, a, new, temple, the, 1988, platform, announced, that, some, believe, in, classic, eschatology, but, dogmatism, in, this, matter, was, philosophically, unjustified, the, notions, of, election, of, israel, and, god, s, covenant, with, it, were, basically, retained, as, well, conservative, conception, of, revelation, encompasses, an, extensive, spectrum, zecharias, frankel, himself, applied, critical, scientific, methods, to, analyze, the, stages, in, the, development, of, the, oral, torah, pioneering, modern, study, of, the, mishnah, he, regarded, the, beatified, sages, as, innovators, who, added, their, own, original, contribution, to, the, canon, not, merely, as, expounders, and, interpreters, of, a, legal, system, given, in, its, entirety, to, moses, on, mount, sinai, yet, he, also, vehemently, rejected, utilizing, these, disciplines, on, the, pentateuch, maintaining, it, was, beyond, human, reach, and, wholly, celestial, in, origin, frankel, never, elucidated, his, beliefs, and, the, exact, correlation, between, human, and, divine, in, his, thought, is, still, subject, to, scholarly, debate, a, similar, negative, approach, toward, higher, criticism, while, accepting, an, evolutionary, understanding, of, oral, law, defined, rabbi, alexander, kohut, solomon, schechter, and, the, early, generation, of, american, conservative, judaism, when, jts, faculty, began, to, embrace, biblical, criticism, in, the, 1920s, they, adapted, a, theological, view, consistent, with, it, an, original, verbal, revelation, did, occur, at, sinai, but, the, text, itself, was, composed, by, later, authors, the, latter, classified, by, dorff, as, a, relatively, moderate, metamorphosis, of, the, old, one, is, still, espoused, by, few, traditionalist, right, wing, conservative, rabbis, though, it, is, marginalized, among, senior, leadership, a, small, but, influential, segment, within, the, jts, and, the, movement, adhered, from, the, 1930s, to, mordecai, kaplan, s, philosophy, that, denied, any, form, of, revelation, but, viewed, all, scripture, as, a, purely, human, product, along, with, other, reconstructionist, tenets, it, dwindled, as, the, latter, consolidated, into, a, separate, group, kaplan, s, views, and, the, permeation, of, higher, criticism, gradually, swayed, most, conservative, thinkers, towards, a, non, verbal, understanding, of, theophany, which, has, become, dominant, in, the, 1970s, this, was, in, sync, with, the, wider, trend, of, lowering, rates, of, americans, who, accepted, the, bible, as, the, word, of, god, dorff, categorized, the, proponents, of, this, into, two, schools, one, maintains, that, god, projected, some, form, of, message, which, inspired, the, human, authors, of, the, pentateuch, to, record, what, they, perceived, the, other, is, often, strongly, influenced, by, franz, rosenzweig, and, other, existentialists, but, also, attracted, many, objectivists, who, consider, human, reason, paramount, the, second, school, states, that, god, conferred, merely, his, presence, on, those, he, influenced, without, any, communication, and, the, experience, drove, them, to, spiritual, creativity, while, they, differ, in, the, theoretical, level, surrounding, revelation, both, practically, regard, all, scripture, and, religious, tradition, as, a, human, product, with, certain, divine, inspiration, providing, an, understanding, that, recognizes, biblical, criticism, and, also, justifies, major, innovation, in, religious, conduct, the, first, doctrine, advocated, by, such, leaders, as, rabbis, ben, zion, bokser, and, robert, gordis, largely, imparted, that, some, elements, within, judaism, are, fully, divine, but, determining, which, would, be, impractical, and, therefore, received, forms, of, interpretation, should, be, basically, upheld, exponents, of, the, latter, view, among, them, rabbis, louis, jacobs, and, neil, gillman, also, emphasized, the, encounter, of, god, with, the, jews, as, a, collective, and, the, role, of, religious, authorities, through, the, generations, in, determining, what, it, implied, the, stress, on, the, supremacy, of, community, and, tradition, rather, than, individual, consciousness, defines, the, entire, spectrum, of, conservative, thought, the, conservative, mainstay, was, the, adoption, of, the, historical, critical, method, in, understanding, judaism, and, setting, its, future, course, in, accepting, an, evolutionary, approach, to, the, religion, as, something, that, developed, over, time, and, absorbed, considerable, external, influences, the, movement, distinguished, between, the, original, meaning, implied, in, traditional, sources, and, the, manner, they, were, grasped, by, successive, generations, rejecting, belief, in, an, unbroken, chain, of, interpretation, from, god, s, original, revelation, immune, to, any, major, extraneous, effects, this, evolutionary, perception, of, religion, while, relatively, moderate, in, comparison, with, more, radical, modernizers, the, scholarship, of, the, positive, historical, school, for, example, sought, to, demonstrate, the, continuity, and, cohesiveness, of, judaism, over, the, years, still, challenged, conservative, leaders, they, regarded, tradition, and, received, mores, with, reverence, especially, the, continued, adherence, to, the, mechanism, of, religious, law, halakha, opposing, indiscriminate, modification, and, emphasized, they, should, be, changed, only, with, care, and, caution, and, remain, observed, by, the, people, rabbi, louis, ginzberg, summarizing, his, movement, s, position, wrote, we, may, now, understand, the, apparent, contradiction, between, theory, and, practice, one, may, conceive, of, the, origin, of, sabbath, as, the, professor, at, university, would, yet, observe, the, smallest, detail, known, to, strict, orthodoxy, the, sanctity, of, the, sabbath, reposes, not, upon, the, fact, that, it, was, proclaimed, on, sinai, but, on, the, fact, that, it, found, for, thousands, of, years, its, expression, in, jewish, souls, it, is, the, task, of, the, historian, to, examine, the, beginnings, and, developments, of, customs, and, observances, practical, judaism, on, the, other, hand, is, not, concerned, with, origins, but, regards, the, institutions, as, they, have, come, to, be, this, discrepancy, between, scientific, criticism, and, insistence, on, heritage, had, to, be, compensated, by, a, conviction, that, would, forestall, either, deviation, from, accepted, norms, or, laxity, and, apathy, a, key, doctrine, which, was, to, fulfil, this, capacity, was, the, collective, will, of, the, jewish, people, conservatives, lent, great, weight, in, determining, religious, practice, both, in, historical, precedent, and, as, a, means, to, shape, present, conduct, zecharias, frankel, pioneered, this, approach, as, michael, a, meyer, commented, the, extraordinary, status, which, he, ascribed, to, the, ingrained, beliefs, and, practices, of, the, community, is, probably, the, most, original, element, of, his, thought, he, turned, it, into, a, source, of, legitimacy, for, both, change, and, preservation, but, mostly, the, latter, the, basic, moderation, and, traditionalism, of, the, majority, among, the, people, were, to, guarantee, a, sense, of, continuity, and, unity, restraining, the, guiding, rabbis, and, scholars, who, at, his, age, were, intent, on, reform, but, also, allowing, them, manoeuvrability, in, adopting, or, discarding, certain, elements, solomon, schechter, espoused, a, similar, position, he, turned, the, old, rabbinic, concept, of, k, lal, yisrael, which, he, translated, as, catholic, israel, into, a, comprehensive, worldview, for, him, the, details, of, divine, revelation, were, of, secondary, significance, as, historical, change, dictated, its, interpretation, through, the, ages, notwithstanding, the, centre, of, authority, is, actually, removed, from, the, bible, he, surmised, and, placed, in, some, living, body, in, touch, with, the, ideal, aspirations, and, the, religious, needs, of, the, age, best, able, to, determine, this, living, body, however, is, not, represented, by, priesthood, or, rabbihood, but, by, the, collective, conscience, of, catholic, israel, the, scope, limits, and, role, of, this, corpus, were, a, matter, for, contention, in, conservative, ranks, schechter, himself, used, it, to, oppose, any, major, break, with, either, traditionalist, or, progressive, elements, within, american, jewry, of, his, day, while, some, of, his, successors, argued, that, the, idea, became, obsolete, due, to, the, great, alienation, of, many, from, received, forms, that, had, to, be, countered, by, innovative, measures, to, draw, them, back, the, conservative, rabbinate, often, vacillated, on, to, which, degree, may, the, non, practicing, religiously, apathetic, strata, be, included, as, a, factor, within, catholic, israel, providing, impulse, for, them, in, determining, religious, questions, even, avant, garde, leaders, acquiesced, that, the, majority, could, not, serve, that, function, right, wing, critics, often, charged, that, the, movement, allowed, its, uncommitted, laity, an, exaggerated, role, conceding, to, its, demands, and, successively, stretching, halakhic, boundaries, beyond, any, limit, the, conservative, leadership, had, limited, success, in, imparting, their, worldview, to, the, general, public, while, the, rabbinate, perceived, itself, as, bearing, a, unique, original, conception, of, judaism, the, masses, lacked, much, interest, regarding, it, mainly, as, a, compromise, offering, a, channel, for, religious, identification, that, was, more, traditional, than, reform, judaism, yet, less, strict, than, orthodoxy, only, a, low, percentage, of, conservative, congregants, actively, pursue, an, observant, lifestyle, in, the, mid, 1980s, charles, liebman, and, daniel, j, elazar, calculated, that, barely, 3, to, 4, per, cent, held, to, one, quite, thoroughly, this, gap, between, principle, and, the, public, more, pronounced, than, in, any, other, jewish, movement, is, often, credited, at, explaining, the, decline, of, the, conservative, movement, while, some, 41, per, cent, of, american, jews, identified, with, it, in, the, 1970s, it, had, shrunk, to, an, estimated, 18, per, cent, and, 11, per, cent, among, those, under, 30, in, 2013, fidelity, and, commitment, to, halakha, while, subject, to, criticism, as, disingenuous, both, from, within, and, without, were, and, remain, a, cornerstone, doctrine, of, conservative, judaism, the, movement, views, the, legalistic, system, as, normative, and, binding, and, believes, jews, must, practically, observe, its, precepts, like, sabbath, dietary, ordinances, ritual, purity, daily, prayer, with, phylacteries, and, the, like, concurrently, examining, jewish, history, and, rabbinic, literature, through, the, lens, of, academic, criticism, it, maintained, that, these, laws, were, always, subject, to, considerable, evolution, and, must, continue, to, do, so, emet, ve, emunah, titled, its, chapter, on, the, subject, with, the, indispensability, of, halakha, stating, that, halakha, in, its, developing, form, is, an, indispensable, element, of, a, traditional, judaism, which, is, vital, and, modern, conservative, judaism, regards, itself, as, the, authentic, inheritor, of, a, flexible, legalistic, tradition, charging, the, orthodox, with, petrifying, the, process, and, reform, with, abandoning, it, the, tension, between, tradition, and, change, which, were, also, the, motto, adopted, by, the, movement, since, the, 1950s, and, the, need, to, balance, them, were, always, a, topic, of, intense, debate, within, conservative, judaism, in, its, early, stages, the, leadership, opposed, pronounced, innovation, mostly, adopting, a, relatively, rigid, position, mordecai, kaplan, s, reconstructionism, raised, the, demand, for, thoroughgoing, modification, without, much, regard, for, the, past, or, halakhic, considerations, but, senior, rabbis, opposed, him, vigorously, even, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, when, kaplan, s, influence, grew, his, superiors, rabbis, louis, ginzberg, louis, finkelstein, and, saul, lieberman, espoused, a, very, conservative, line, since, the, 1970s, with, the, strengthening, of, the, liberal, wing, within, the, movement, the, majority, in, the, rabbinic, assembly, opted, for, quite, radical, reformulations, in, religious, conduct, but, rejected, the, reconstructionist, non, halakhic, approach, insisting, that, the, legalistic, method, be, maintained, the, halakhic, commitment, of, conservative, judaism, has, been, subject, to, much, criticism, from, within, and, without, right, wing, discontents, including, the, union, for, traditional, judaism, which, seceded, in, protest, of, the, 1983, resolution, to, ordain, women, rabbis, adopted, at, an, open, vote, where, all, jts, faculty, regardless, of, qualification, were, counted, contested, the, validity, of, this, description, as, well, as, progressives, like, rabbi, neil, gillman, who, exhorted, the, movement, to, cease, describing, itself, as, halakhic, in, 2005, stating, that, after, repeated, concessions, our, original, claim, has, died, a, death, by, a, thousand, qualifications, it, has, lost, all, factual, meaning, the, main, body, entrusted, with, formulating, rulings, responsa, and, statues, is, the, committee, on, jewish, law, and, standards, cjls, a, panel, with, 25, voting, legalistic, specialists, and, further, 11, observers, there, is, also, the, smaller, va, ad, ha, halakha, law, committee, of, israel, s, masorti, movement, every, responsa, must, receive, a, minimum, of, six, voters, to, be, considered, an, official, position, of, the, cjls, conservative, judaism, explicitly, acknowledges, the, principle, of, halakhic, pluralism, enabling, the, panel, to, adopt, more, than, one, resolution, in, any, given, subject, the, final, authority, in, each, conservative, community, is, the, local, rabbi, the, mara, d, atra, lord, of, the, locality, in, traditional, terms, enfranchised, to, adopt, either, minority, or, majority, opinions, from, the, cjls, or, maintain, local, practice, thus, on, the, issue, of, admitting, openly, homosexual, rabbinic, candidates, the, committee, approved, two, resolutions, one, in, favour, and, one, against, the, jts, took, the, lenient, position, while, the, seminario, rabinico, latinoamericano, still, adheres, to, the, latter, likewise, while, most, conservative, synagogues, approved, of, egalitarianism, for, women, in, religious, life, some, still, maintain, traditional, gender, roles, and, do, not, count, females, for, prayer, quorums, the, conservative, treatment, of, halakha, is, defined, by, several, features, though, the, entire, range, of, its, halakhic, discourse, cannot, be, sharply, distinguished, from, either, the, traditional, or, orthodox, one, rabbi, david, golinkin, who, attempted, to, classify, its, parameters, stressed, that, quite, often, rulings, merely, reiterate, conclusions, reached, in, older, sources, or, even, orthodox, ones, for, example, in, the, details, of, preparing, sabbath, ritual, enclosures, it, draws, directly, on, the, opinions, of, the, shulchan, aruch, and, rabbi, hayim, david, halevi, another, tendency, prevalent, among, the, movement, s, rabbis, yet, again, not, particular, to, it, is, the, adoption, of, the, more, lenient, positions, on, the, matters, at, question, though, this, is, not, universal, and, responsa, also, took, stringent, ones, not, infrequently, a, more, distinctive, characterization, is, a, greater, proclivity, to, base, rulings, on, earlier, sources, in, the, rishonim, or, before, them, as, far, back, as, the, talmud, conservative, decisors, frequently, resort, to, less, canonical, sources, isolated, responsa, or, minority, opinions, they, demonstrate, more, fluidity, in, regards, to, established, precedent, and, continuum, in, rabbinic, literature, mainly, those, by, the, later, authorities, and, lay, little, stress, on, the, perceived, hierarchy, between, major, and, minor, legalists, of, the, past, they, are, far, more, inclined, to, contend, machloket, with, old, rulings, to, be, flexible, towards, custom, or, to, wholly, disregard, it, this, is, especially, expressed, in, less, hesitancy, to, rule, against, or, notwithstanding, the, major, codifications, of, jewish, law, like, mishneh, torah, arba, ah, turim, and, especially, the, shulchan, aruch, with, its, isserles, gloss, and, later, commentaries, conservative, authorities, while, often, relying, on, the, shulchan, aruch, themselves, criticize, the, orthodox, for, relatively, rarely, venturing, beyond, it, and, overly, canonizing, rabbi, joseph, karo, s, work, in, several, occasions, conservative, rabbis, discerned, that, the, shulchan, aruch, ruled, without, firm, precedent, sometimes, deriving, his, conclusions, from, the, kabbalah, an, important, example, is, the, ruling, of, rabbi, golinkin, contrary, to, the, majority, consensus, among, the, acharonim, and, the, more, prominent, rishonim, but, based, on, many, opinions, of, the, lesser, rishonim, which, is, derived, from, a, minority, view, in, the, talmud, that, the, sabbatical, year, is, not, obligatory, in, present, times, at, all, neither, de, oraita, nor, de, rabanan, but, rather, an, act, of, piety, ethical, considerations, and, the, weight, due, to, them, in, determining, halakhic, issues, mainly, to, what, degree, may, modern, sensibilities, shape, the, outcome, are, subject, to, much, discourse, right, wing, decisors, like, rabbi, joel, roth, maintained, that, such, elements, are, naturally, a, factor, in, formulating, conclusions, but, may, not, alone, serve, as, a, justification, for, adopting, a, position, the, majority, however, basically, subscribed, to, the, opinion, evinced, already, by, rabbi, seymour, siegel, in, the, 1960s, that, the, cultural, and, ethical, norms, of, the, community, the, contemporary, equivalents, of, talmudic, aggadah, should, supersede, the, legalistic, forms, when, the, two, came, into, conflict, and, there, was, a, pivotal, ethical, concern, rabbi, elliot, dorff, concluded, that, in, contrast, to, the, orthodox, conservative, judaism, maintains, that, the, juridical, details, and, processes, mainly, serve, higher, moral, purposes, and, could, be, modified, if, they, no, longer, do, so, in, other, words, the, aggadah, should, control, the, halakha, the, liberal, rabbi, gordon, tucker, along, with, gillman, and, other, progressives, supported, a, far, reaching, implementation, of, this, approach, making, conservative, judaism, much, more, aggadic, and, allowing, moral, priorities, an, overriding, authority, at, all, occasions, this, idea, became, very, popular, among, the, young, generation, but, it, was, not, fully, embraced, either, in, the, 2006, resolution, on, homosexuals, the, cjls, chose, a, middle, path, they, agreed, that, the, ethical, consideration, of, human, dignity, was, of, supreme, importance, but, not, sufficient, to, uproot, the, express, biblical, prohibition, on, not, to, lie, with, mankind, as, with, womankind, traditionally, understood, as, banning, full, anal, intercourse, all, other, limitations, including, on, other, forms, of, sexual, relations, were, lifted, a, similar, approach, is, manifest, in, the, great, weight, ascribed, to, sociological, changes, in, deciding, religious, policy, the, cjls, and, the, rabbinical, assembly, members, frequently, state, that, circumstances, were, profoundly, transformed, in, modern, times, fulfilling, the, criteria, mandating, new, rulings, in, various, fields, based, on, general, talmudic, principles, like, shinui, ha, i, ttim, change, of, times, this, along, with, the, ethical, aspect, was, a, main, argument, for, revolutionizing, the, role, of, women, in, religious, life, and, embracing, egalitarianism, the, most, distinctive, feature, of, conservative, legalistic, discourse, in, which, it, is, conspicuously, and, sharply, different, from, orthodoxy, is, the, incorporation, of, critical, scientific, methods, into, the, process, deliberations, almost, always, delineate, the, historical, development, of, the, specific, issue, at, hand, from, the, earliest, known, mentions, until, modern, times, this, approach, enables, a, thorough, analysis, of, the, manner, in, which, it, was, practiced, accepted, rejected, or, modified, in, various, periods, not, necessarily, in, sync, with, the, received, rabbinic, understanding, archaeology, philology, and, judaic, studies, are, employed, rabbis, use, comparative, compendiums, of, religious, manuscripts, sometimes, discerning, that, sentences, were, only, added, later, or, include, spelling, grammar, and, transcription, errors, changing, the, entire, understanding, of, certain, passages, this, critical, approach, is, central, to, the, movement, for, its, historicist, underpinning, stresses, that, all, religious, literature, has, an, original, meaning, relevant, in, the, context, of, its, formulation, this, meaning, may, be, analyzed, and, discerned, and, is, distinct, from, the, later, interpretations, ascribed, by, traditional, commentators, decisors, are, also, far, more, prone, to, include, references, to, external, scientific, sources, in, relevant, fields, like, veterinarian, publications, in, halakhic, matters, concerning, livestock, conservative, authorities, as, part, of, their, promulgation, of, a, dynamic, halakha, often, cite, the, manner, in, which, the, sages, of, old, used, rabbinic, statutes, takkanah, that, enabled, the, bypassing, of, prohibitions, in, the, pentateuch, like, the, prozbul, or, heter, i, ska, in, 1948, when, employing, those, was, first, debated, rabbi, isaac, klein, argued, that, since, there, was, no, consensus, on, leadership, within, catholic, israel, formulation, of, significant, takkanot, should, be, avoided, another, proposal, to, ratify, them, only, with, a, two, thirds, majority, in, the, ra, was, rejected, new, statues, require, a, simple, majority, 13, supporters, among, the, 25, members, of, the, cjls, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, such, drastic, measures, as, rabbi, arnold, m, goodman, cited, in, a, 1996, writ, allowing, members, of, the, priestly, caste, to, marry, divorcees, later, authorities, were, reluctant, to, assume, such, unilateral, authority, fear, that, invoking, this, principle, would, create, the, proverbial, slippery, slope, thereby, weakening, the, entire, halakhic, structure, thus, imposed, severe, limitations, on, the, conditions, and, situations, where, it, would, be, appropriate, were, carefully, drafted, as, temporal, emergency, ordinances, horaat, sha, ah, grounded, on, the, need, the, avoid, a, total, rift, of, many, nonobservant, jews, later, on, these, ordinances, became, accepted, and, permanent, on, the, practical, level, the, conservative, movement, issued, a, wide, range, of, new, thoroughgoing, statues, from, the, famous, 1950, responsum, that, allowed, driving, to, the, synagogue, on, the, sabbath, and, up, to, the, 2000, decision, to, ban, rabbis, from, inquiring, about, whether, someone, was, a, mamzer, de, facto, abolishing, this, legal, category, the, ra, and, cjls, reached, many, decisions, through, the, years, shaping, a, distinctive, profile, for, conservative, practice, and, worship, in, the, 1940s, when, the, public, demanded, mixed, seating, of, both, sexes, in, synagogue, some, rabbis, argued, there, was, no, precedent, but, obliged, on, the, ground, of, dire, need, eth, la, asot, others, noted, that, archaeological, research, showed, no, partitions, in, ancient, synagogues, mixed, seating, became, commonplace, in, almost, all, congregations, in, 1950, it, was, ruled, that, using, electricity, that, is, closure, of, an, electrical, circuit, did, not, constitute, kindling, a, fire, unto, itself, not, even, in, incandescent, bulbs, and, therefore, was, not, a, forbidden, labour, and, could, be, done, on, the, sabbath, on, that, basis, while, performing, banned, labours, is, of, course, forbidden, for, example, video, recording, is, still, constituted, as, writing, switching, lights, and, other, functions, are, allowed, though, the, ra, strongly, urges, adherents, to, keep, the, sanctity, of, the, sabbath, refraining, from, doing, anything, that, may, imitate, the, atmosphere, of, weekdays, like, loud, noise, reminiscent, of, work, the, need, to, encourage, arrival, at, synagogue, also, motivated, the, cjls, during, the, same, year, to, issue, a, temporal, statue, allowing, driving, on, that, day, for, that, purpose, alone, it, was, supported, by, decreeing, that, the, combustion, of, fuel, did, not, serve, any, of, the, acts, prohibited, during, the, construction, of, the, tabernacle, and, could, therefore, be, classified, according, to, their, interpretation, of, the, tosafists, opinion, as, redundant, labour, sh, eina, tzricha, l, gufa, and, be, permitted, the, validity, of, this, argument, was, heavily, disputed, within, the, movement, in, 1952, members, of, the, priestly, caste, were, allowed, to, marry, divorcees, conditioned, on, forfeiture, of, their, privileges, as, termination, of, marriage, became, widespread, and, women, who, underwent, it, could, not, be, suspected, of, unsavory, acts, in, 1967, the, ban, on, priests, marrying, converts, was, also, lifted, in, 1954, the, issue, of, agunot, women, refused, divorce, by, their, husbands, was, largely, settled, by, adding, a, clause, to, the, prenuptial, contract, under, which, men, had, to, pay, alimony, as, long, as, they, did, not, concede, in, 1968, this, mechanism, was, replaced, by, a, retroactive, expropriation, of, the, bride, price, rendering, the, marriage, void, in, 1955, more, girls, were, celebrating, bat, mitzvah, and, demanded, to, be, allowed, ascents, to, the, torah, the, cjls, agreed, that, the, ordinance, under, which, women, were, banned, from, this, due, to, respect, for, the, congregation, kvod, ha, tzibur, was, no, longer, relevant, in, 1972, it, was, decreed, that, rennet, even, if, derived, from, unclean, animals, was, so, transformed, that, it, constituted, a, wholly, new, item, panim, chadashot, ba, u, l, khan, and, therefore, all, hard, cheese, could, be, considered, kosher, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, saw, the, emergence, of, women, s, rights, on, the, main, agenda, growing, pressure, led, the, cjls, to, adopt, a, motion, that, females, may, be, counted, as, part, of, a, quorum, based, on, the, argument, that, only, the, shulchan, aruch, explicitly, stated, that, it, consist, of, men, while, accepted, this, was, very, controversial, in, the, committee, and, heavily, disputed, a, more, complete, solution, was, offered, in, 1983, by, rabbi, joel, roth, and, was, also, enacted, to, allow, women, rabbinic, ordination, roth, noted, that, some, decisors, of, old, acknowledged, that, women, may, bless, when, performing, positive, time, bound, commandments, from, which, they, are, exempted, and, therefore, unable, to, fulfill, the, obligation, for, others, especially, citing, the, manner, in, which, they, assumed, upon, themselves, the, counting, of, the, omer, he, suggested, that, women, voluntarily, commit, to, pray, thrice, a, day, et, cetera, and, his, responsa, was, adopted, since, then, female, rabbis, were, ordained, at, jts, and, other, seminaries, in, 1994, the, movement, accepted, judith, hauptman, s, principally, egalitarian, argument, according, to, which, equal, prayer, obligations, for, women, were, never, banned, explicitly, and, it, was, only, their, inferior, status, that, hindered, participation, in, 2006, openly, gay, rabbinic, candidates, were, also, to, be, admitted, into, the, jts, in, 2012, a, commitment, ceremony, for, same, sex, couples, was, devised, though, not, defined, as, kiddushin, in, 2016, the, rabbis, passed, a, resolution, supporting, transgender, rights, conservative, judaism, in, the, united, states, held, a, relatively, strict, policy, regarding, intermarriage, propositions, for, acknowledging, jews, by, patrilineal, descent, as, in, the, reform, movement, were, overwhelmingly, dismissed, unconverted, spouses, were, largely, barred, from, community, membership, and, participation, in, rituals, clergy, are, banned, from, any, involvement, in, interfaith, marriage, on, pain, of, dismissal, however, as, the, rate, of, such, unions, rose, dramatically, conservative, congregations, began, describing, gentile, family, members, as, k, rov, yisrael, kin, of, israel, and, be, more, open, toward, them, the, leadership, council, of, conservative, judaism, stated, in, 1995, we, want, to, encourage, the, jewish, partner, to, maintain, his, her, jewish, identity, and, raise, their, children, as, jews, despite, the, centralization, of, legal, deliberation, on, matters, of, jewish, law, in, the, cjls, individual, synagogues, and, communities, must, in, the, end, depend, on, their, local, decision, makers, the, rabbi, in, his, or, her, or, their, community, is, regarded, as, the, mara, d, atra, or, the, local, halakhic, decisor, rabbis, trained, in, the, reading, practices, of, conservative, jewish, approaches, historical, evaluation, of, jewish, law, and, interpretation, of, biblical, and, rabbinic, texts, may, align, directly, with, the, cjls, decisions, or, themselves, opine, on, matters, based, on, precedents, or, readings, of, text, that, shine, light, on, congregants, questions, so, for, instance, a, rabbi, may, or, may, not, choose, to, permit, video, streaming, on, shabbat, despite, a, majority, ruling, that, allows, for, use, of, electronics, a, local, mara, d, atra, may, rely, on, the, reasoning, found, in, the, majority, or, minority, opinions, of, the, cjls, or, have, other, textual, and, halakhic, grounds, i, e, prioritizing, jewish, values, or, legal, concepts, to, rule, one, way, or, another, on, matters, of, ritual, family, life, or, sacred, pursuits, this, balance, between, a, centralization, of, halakhic, authority, and, maintaining, the, authority, of, local, rabbis, reflects, the, commitment, to, pluralism, at, the, heart, of, the, movement, the, term, conservative, judaism, was, used, still, generically, and, not, yet, as, a, specific, label, already, in, the, 1887, dedication, speech, of, the, jewish, theological, seminary, of, america, by, rabbi, alexander,

the, faith, the, new, academic, critical, study, of, judaism, wissenschaft, des, judentums, soon, became, a, source, of, controversy, rabbis, and, scholars, argued, to, what, degree, if, at, all, its, findings, could, be, used, to, determine, present, conduct, the, modernized, orthodox, in, germany, like, rabbis, isaac, bernays, and, azriel, hildesheimer, were, content, to, cautiously, study, it, while, stringently, adhering, to, the, sanctity, of, holy, texts, and, refusing, to, grant, wissenschaft, any, say, in, religious, matters, on, the, other, extreme, were, rabbi, abraham, geiger, who, would, emerge, as, the, founding, father, of, reform, judaism, and, his, supporters, they, opposed, any, limit, on, critical, research, or, its, practical, application, laying, more, weight, on, the, need, for, change, than, on, continuity, the, prague, born, rabbi, zecharias, frankel, appointed, chief, rabbi, of, the, kingdom, of, saxony, in, 1836, gradually, rose, to, become, the, leader, of, those, who, stood, at, the, middle, besides, working, for, the, civic, betterment, of, local, jews, and, educational, reform, he, displayed, keen, interest, in, wissenschaft, but, frankel, was, always, cautious, and, deeply, reverent, towards, tradition, privately, writing, in, 1836, that, the, means, must, be, applied, with, such, care, and, discretion, that, forward, progress, will, be, reached, unnoticed, and, seem, inconsequential, to, the, average, spectator, he, soon, found, himself, embroiled, in, the, great, disputes, of, the, 1840s, in, 1842, during, the, second, hamburg, temple, controversy, he, opposed, the, new, reform, prayerbook, arguing, the, elimination, of, petitions, for, a, future, return, to, zion, led, by, the, messiah, was, a, violation, of, an, ancient, tenet, but, he, also, opposed, the, ban, placed, on, the, tome, by, rabbi, bernays, stating, this, was, a, primitive, behaviour, in, the, same, year, he, and, the, moderate, conservative, s, l, rapoport, were, the, only, ones, of, nineteen, respondents, who, negatively, answered, the, breslau, community, s, enquiry, on, whether, the, deeply, unorthodox, geiger, could, serve, there, in, 1843, frankel, clashed, with, the, radical, reform, rabbi, samuel, holdheim, who, argued, that, the, act, of, marriage, in, judaism, was, a, civic, memonot, rather, than, sanctified, issurim, matter, and, could, be, subject, to, the, law, of, the, land, in, december, 1843, frankel, launched, the, magazine, zeitschrift, f, r, die, religi, sen, interessen, des, judenthums, in, the, preamble, he, attempted, to, present, his, approach, to, the, present, plight, the, further, development, of, judaism, cannot, be, done, through, reform, that, would, lead, to, total, dissipation, but, must, be, involved, in, its, study, pursued, via, scientific, research, on, a, positive, historical, basis, the, term, positive, historical, became, associated, with, him, and, his, middle, way, the, zeitschrift, was, along, the, convictions, of, its, publisher, neither, dogmatically, orthodox, nor, overly, polemic, wholly, opposing, biblical, criticism, and, arguing, for, the, antiquity, of, custom, and, practice, in, 1844, geiger, and, like, minded, allies, arranged, a, conference, in, braunschweig, that, was, to, have, enough, authority, since, 1826, rabbi, aaron, chorin, called, for, the, convocation, of, a, new, sanhedrin, to, debate, and, enact, thoroughgoing, revisions, frankel, was, willing, to, agree, only, to, a, meeting, without, any, practical, results, and, refused, the, invitation, when, the, protocols, which, contained, many, radical, statements, were, published, he, denounced, the, assembly, for, applying, the, scalpel, of, criticism, and, favouring, the, spirit, of, the, age, over, tradition, however, he, later, agreed, to, attend, the, second, conference, held, in, frankfurt, am, main, on, 15, july, 1845, in, spite, of, warnings, from, rapoport, who, cautioned, that, compromise, with, geiger, was, impossible, and, he, would, only, damage, his, reputation, among, the, traditionalists, on, the, 16th, the, issue, of, hebrew, in, the, liturgy, arose, most, present, were, inclined, to, retain, it, but, with, more, german, segments, a, small, majority, adopted, a, resolution, stating, there, were, subjective, but, no, objective, imperatives, to, keep, it, as, the, language, of, service, frankel, then, astounded, his, peers, by, vehemently, protesting, stating, it, was, a, breach, with, the, past, and, that, hebrew, was, of, dire, importance, and, great, sentimental, value, the, others, immediately, began, quoting, all, passages, in, rabbinic, literature, allowing, prayer, in, the, vernacular, frankel, could, not, contend, with, the, halakhic, validity, of, their, decision, but, he, perceived, it, as, a, sign, of, profound, differences, between, them, on, the, 17th, he, formally, withdrew, publishing, a, lambasting, critique, of, the, procedures, opponents, of, the, conference, who, feared, he, went, to, the, other, side, noted, historian, michael, a, meyer, now, felt, reassured, of, his, loyalty, the, rabbi, of, saxony, had, many, sympathizers, who, supported, a, similarly, moderate, approach, and, change, only, on, the, basis, of, the, authority, of, the, talmud, when, geiger, began, preparing, a, third, conference, in, breslau, hirsch, b, r, fassel, convinced, frankel, to, organize, one, of, his, own, in, protest, frankel, invited, colleagues, to, an, assembly, in, dresden, which, was, to, be, held, on, 21, october, 1846, he, announced, that, one, measure, he, was, willing, to, countenance, was, the, possible, abolition, of, the, second, day, of, festivals, though, only, if, a, broad, consensus, will, be, reached, and, not, before, thorough, deliberation, attendants, were, to, include, rapoport, fassel, adolf, jellinek, leopold, l, w, michael, sachs, abraham, kohn, and, others, however, the, dresden, assembly, soon, drew, heated, orthodox, resistance, especially, from, rabbi, jacob, ettlinger, and, was, postponed, indefinitely, in, 1854, frankel, was, appointed, chancellor, in, the, new, jewish, theological, seminary, of, breslau, the, first, modern, rabbinical, seminary, in, germany, his, opponents, on, both, flanks, were, incensed, geiger, and, the, reform, camp, long, accused, him, of, theological, ambiguity, hypocrisy, and, attachment, to, stagnant, remnants, and, now, protested, the, medieval, atmosphere, in, the, seminary, which, was, mainly, concerned, with, teaching, jewish, law, the, hardline, orthodox, samson, raphael, hirsch, who, fiercely, opposed, wissenschaft, and, emphasized, the, divine, origin, of, the, entire, halakhic, system, in, the, theophany, at, sinai, was, deeply, suspicious, of, frankel, s, beliefs, use, of, science, and, constant, assertions, that, jewish, law, was, flexible, and, evolving, the, final, schism, between, frankel, and, the, orthodox, occurred, after, the, 1859, publication, of, his, darke, ha, mishna, ways, of, the, mishna, he, heaved, praise, on, the, beatified, sages, presenting, them, as, bold, innovators, but, not, once, affirmed, the, divinity, of, the, oral, torah, on, the, ordinances, classified, as, law, given, to, moses, at, sinai, he, quoted, asher, ben, jehiel, that, stated, several, of, those, were, only, apocryphally, dubbed, as, such, he, applied, the, latter, s, conclusion, to, all, noting, they, were, so, evident, as, if, given, at, sinai, hirsch, branded, frankel, a, heretic, demanding, he, announce, whether, he, believed, that, both, the, oral, and, written, torah, were, of, celestial, origin, rabbis, benjamin, hirsch, auerbach, solomon, klein, and, others, published, more, complaisant, tracts, but, also, requested, an, explanation, rapoport, marshaled, to, frankel, s, aid, assuring, that, his, words, were, merely, reiterating, ben, jehiel, s, and, that, he, would, soon, release, a, statement, that, will, belie, hirsch, s, accusations, but, then, the, chancellor, of, breslau, issued, an, ambiguous, defence, writing, that, his, book, was, not, concerned, with, theology, and, avoiding, giving, any, clear, answer, now, even, rapoport, joined, his, critics, hirsch, succeeded, severely, tarnishing, frankel, s, reputation, among, most, concerned, along, with, fellow, orthodox, rabbi, azriel, hildesheimer, hirsch, launched, a, protracted, public, campaign, through, the, 1860s, they, ceaselessly, stressed, the, chasm, between, an, orthodox, understanding, of, halakha, as, derived, and, revealed, applied, differently, to, different, circumstances, and, subject, to, human, judgement, and, possibly, error, yet, unchanging, and, divine, in, principle, as, opposed, to, an, evolutionary, historicist, and, non, dogmatic, approach, in, which, past, authorities, were, not, just, elaborating, but, consciously, innovating, as, taught, by, frankel, hildesheimer, often, repeated, that, this, issue, utterly, overshadowed, any, specific, technical, argument, with, the, breslau, school, the, students, of, which, were, often, more, lenient, on, matters, of, headcovering, for, women, chalav, yisrael, and, other, issues, hildesheimer, was, concerned, that, jewish, public, opinion, perceived, no, practical, difference, between, them, though, he, cared, to, distinguish, the, observant, acolytes, of, frankel, from, the, reform, camp, he, noted, in, his, diary, how, meager, is, the, principal, difference, between, the, breslau, school, who, don, silk, gloves, at, their, work, and, geiger, who, wields, a, sledgehammer, in, 1863, when, breslau, faculty, member, heinrich, graetz, published, an, article, where, he, appeared, to, doubt, the, messianic, belief, hildesheimer, immediately, seized, upon, the, occasion, to, prove, once, more, the, dogmatic, rather, than, practical, divide, he, denounced, graetz, as, a, heretic, the, positive, historical, school,

judaism, which, had, no, independent, meaning, at, the, time, and, was, only, in, relation, to, reform, in, 1898, pereira, mendes, schneeberger, and, drachman, also, founded, the, orthodox, union, which, maintained, close, ties, with, the, seminary, the, jts, was, a, small, fledgling, institution, with, financial, difficulties, and, was, ordaining, merely, a, rabbi, per, year, but, soon, after, chancellor, morais, death, in, 1897, its, fortunes, turned, since, 1881, a, wave, of, jewish, immigration, from, eastern, europe, was, inundating, the, country, by, 1920, 2, 5, million, of, them, had, arrived, increasing, american, jewry, tenfold, they, came, from, regions, where, civil, equality, or, emancipation, were, never, granted, while, acculturation, and, modernization, made, little, headway, whether, devout, or, irreligious, they, mostly, retained, strong, traditional, sentiments, in, matters, of, faith, accustomed, to, old, style, rabbinate, the, hardline, agudas, harabbanim,

who, tolerated, what, was, beyond, the, pale, for, him, however, this, first, sign, of, institutionalization, and, separation, was, far, from, conclusive, mendes, himself, could, not, clearly,

his, disciples, kept, his, non, sectarian, legacy, of, striving, for, a, united, traditional, american, judaism, he, was, replaced, by, cyrus, adler, the, usoa, grew, rapidly, as, the, eastern, european, immigrant, population, slowly, integrated, in, 1923, it, already, had, 150, affiliated, communities, and, 229, before, 1930, synagogues, offered, a, more, modernized, ritual, english,

american, jews, away, from, tradition, barely, 20, per, cent, were, attending, prayers, weekly, a, young, professor, named, mordecai, kaplan, promoted, the, idea, of, transforming, the, synagogue, into, a, community, center, a, shul, with, a, pool, a, policy, which, indeed, stymied, the, tide, somewhat, in, 1927, the, ra, also, established, its, own, committee, of, jewish, law, entrusted, with, determining, halakhic, issues, consisting, of, seven, members, it, was, chaired, by, the, traditionalist, rabbi, louis, ginzberg, who, already, distinguished, himself, in, 1922, drafting, a, responsa, that, allowed, the, use, of, grape, juice, rather, than, fermented, wine, for, kiddush, on, the, background, of, prohibition, kaplan, himself, who, rose, to, become, an, influential, and, popular, figure, within, the, jts, concluded, that, his, fellow, rabbis, ambiguity, in, matters, of, belief, and, the, contradiction, between, full, observance, and, critical, study, were, untenable, and, hypocritical, he, formulated, his, own, approach, of, judaism, as, a, civilization, rejecting, the, concept, of, revelation, and, any, supernatural, belief, in, favour, of, a, cultural, ethnic, perception, while, valuing, received, mores, he, eventually, suggested, giving, the, past, a, vote, not, a, veto, though, popular, among, students, kaplan, s, nascent, reconstructionism, was, opposed, by, the, new, traditionalist, chancellor, louis, finkelstein, appointed, in, 1940, and, a, large, majority, among, the, faculty, tensions, within, the, jts, and, ra, grew, the, committee, of, jewish, law, consisted, mainly, of, scholars, who, had, little, field, experience, almost, solely, from, the, seminary, s, talmudic, department, they, were, greatly, concerned, with, halakhic, licitness, and, indifferent, to, the, pressures, exerted, on, the, pulpit, rabbis, who, had, to, contend, with, an, americanized, public, which, cared, little, for, such, considerations, or, for, tradition, in, general, in, 1935, the, ra, almost, adopted, a, groundbreaking, motion, rabbi, louis, epstein, offered, a, solution, to, the, agunah, predicament, a, clause, that, would, have, had, husbands, appoint, wives, as, their, proxies, to, issue, divorce, it, was, repealed, under, pressure, from, the, orthodox, union, as, late, as, 1947, cjl, chair, rabbi, boaz, cohen, himself, a, historicist, who, argued, that, the, law, evolved, much, through, time, rebuked, pulpit, clergy, who, requested, lenient, or, radical, rulings, stating, he, and, his, peers, were, content, to, progress, in, inches, free, setting, up, of, new, premises, and, the, introduction, of, novel, categories, of, ritual, upon, the, basis, of, pure, reason, and, thinking, would, be, perilous, if, not, fatal, to, the, principles, and, continuity, of, jewish, law, the, boundaries, between, orthodox, and, conservative, judaism, in, america, were, institutionalized, only, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, the, 1940s, saw, the, younger, generation, of, jts, graduates, less, patient, with, the, prudence, of, the, cjl, and, talmud, faculty, in, face, of, popular, demand, kaplan, s, reconstructionism, while, its, fully, committed, partisans, were, few, had, much, influence, the, majority, among, recent, alumni, eschewed, the, epithet, orthodox, and, tended, to, employ, conservative, exclusively, succeeding, schechter, s, direct, disciples, who, headed, the, ra, jts, and, united, synagogue, in, the, interwar, period, a, new, strata, of, activist, leaders, was, rising, rabbi, robert, gordis, ra, president, in, 1944, 1946, represented, the, junior, members, in, advocating, more, flexibility, rabbi, jacob, agus, a, riets, graduate, who, joined, the, body, only, in, 1945, clamored, that, we, need, a, law, making, body, not, a, law, interpreting, committee, agus, argued, that, the, breach, between, the, jewish, public, and, tradition, was, too, wide, to, be, bridged, conventionally, and, that, the, ra, would, always, remain, inferior, to, the, orthodox, as, long, as, it, retained, its, policy, of, merely, adopting, lenient, precedents, in, rabbinic, literature, he, offered, to, extensively, apply, the, tool, of, takkanah, rabbinic, ordinance, in, 1946, a, committee, chaired, by, gordis, issued, the, sabbath, and, festival, prayerbook, the, first, clearly, conservative, liturgy, references, to, the, sacrificial, cult, were, in, the, past, tense, instead, of, a, petition, for, restoration, and, it, rephrased, blessings, such, as, who, hast, made, me, according, to, thy, will, for, women, to, who, hast, made, me, a, woman, during, the, movement, s, national, conference, in, chicago, held, 13, 17, may, 1948, the, pulpit, rabbis, in, the, ra, gained, the, upper, hand, spurred, by, gordis, agus, and, fellow, leaders, they, voted, to, reorganize, the, cjl, into, a, committee, of, jewish, law, and, standards, enfranchised, to, issue, takkanot, by, a, majority, membership, was, conditioned, on, having, experience, as, a, congregational, rabbi, and, unseasoned, jts, faculty, were, thus, denied, entrance, while, the, ra, was, asserting, a, conservative, distinctive, identity, the, seminary, remained, more, cautious, finkelstein, opposed, sectarianism, and, preferred, the, neutral, epithet, traditional, later, commenting, that, conservative, judaism, is, a, gimmick, to, get, jews, back, to, real, judaism, he, and, the, very, right, wing, talmud, professor, saul, lieberman, who, maintained, ties, with, the, orthodox, while, also, viewing, them, as, obstructionist, and, ossified, dominated, the, jts, providing, a, counterweight, to, the, liberals, in, the, assembly, kaplan, meanwhile, spent, more, time, on, consolidating, his, society, for, advancement, of, judaism, abraham, joshua, heschel, who, espoused, a, mysticist, understanding, of, jewish, religion, also, became, an, important, figure, among, the, faculty, the, cjls, now, proceeded, to, demonstrate, its, independence, sabbath, was, widely, desecrated, by, a, large, majority, of, jews, and, the, board, believed, attendance, at, synagogues, should, be, encouraged, they, therefore, enacted, an, ordinance, that, allowed, driving, on, the, sabbath, for, worship, alone, and, the, use, of, electricity, the, driving, responsum, was, later, severely, criticized, by, conservative, rabbis, and, was, charged, with, imparting, that, the, movement, was, overly, keen, to, condone, the, laxity, of, congregants, it, also, signified, the, final, break, with, the, orthodox, who, were, themselves, being, bolstered, by, more, strictly, observant, immigrants, from, europe, in, 1954, the, rca, reversed, its, 1948, ruling, that, allowed, the, use, of, microphones, on, sabbath, and, festivals, and, declared, that, praying, without, a, partition, between, sexes, was, banned, though, enforced, slowly, in, 1997, there, were, still, seven, ou, congregations, with, no, physical,

and, often, adhering, to, a, verbal, understanding, of, revelation, was, dismayed, by, the, failure, to, bolster, observance, among, the, laity, and, the, resurgence, of, orthodoxy, the, left, was, influenced, by, the, reconstructionists, who, formed, their, own, seminary, in, 1968, and, were, slowly, coalescing, as, well, as, the, growing, appeal, of, reform, which, turned, more, traditional,
