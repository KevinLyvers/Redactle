her, weaving, hall, while, a, variant, account, identifies, the, goddess, who, was, killed, during, this, incident, as, wakahirume, no, mikoto, lit, young, woman, of, the, sun, day, time, whereas, the, above, accounts, identify, susanoo, s, flaying, of, the, horse, as, the, immediate, cause, for, amaterasu, hiding, herself, yet, another, variant, in, the, shoki, instead, portrays, it, to, be,

degree, nevertheless, the, sun, goddess, out, of, her, friendship, for, him, was, not, indignant, or, resentful, but, took, everything, calmly, and, with, forbearance, when, the, time, came, for, the,

heavenly, gods, finally, sent, the, warrior, deities, futsunushi, and, takemikazuchi, to, remonstrate, with, kuninushi, at, the, advice, of, his, son, kotoshironushi, kuninushi, agreed, to, abdicate, and, left, the, physical, realm, to, govern, the, unseen, spirit, world, which, was, given, to, him, in, exchange, the, two, gods, then, went, around, ashihara, no, nakatsukuni, killing, those, who,

themselves, stranded, in, the, mountains, takamimusubi, so, the, kojiki, or, amaterasu, shoki, then, told, iwarebiko, in, a, dream, that, the, giant, crow, yatagarasu, would, be, sent, to, guide, them, in, their, way, soon, enough, the, bird, appeared, and, led, iwarebiko, and, his, men, to, safety, at, length, iwarebiko, arrived, at, the, land, of, yamato, modern, nara, prefecture, and,

that, amaterasu, via, the, yata, no, kagami, and, the, kusanagi, sword, and, yamato, no, okunitama, the, tutelary, deity, of, yamato, were, originally, worshipped, in, the, great, hall, of, the, imperial, palace, when, a, series, of, plagues, broke, out, during, sujin, s, reign, he, dreaded, the, power, of, these, gods, and, did, not, feel, secure, in, their, dwelling, together, he, thus, entrusted, the, mirror, and, the, sword, to, his, daughter, toyosukiirihime, who, brought, them, to, the, village, of, kasanuhi, and, she, would, become, the, first, sai, and, delegated, the, worship, of, yamato, no, okunitama, to, another, daughter, nunakiirihime, when, the, pestilence, showed, no, sign, of, abating, he, then, performed, divination, which, revealed, the, plague, to, have, been, caused, by, mononushi, the, god, of, mount, miwa, when, the, god, was, offered, proper, worship, as, per, his, demands, the, epidemic, ceased, during, the, reign, of, sujin, s, son, and, successor, emperor, suinin, custody, of, the, sacred, treasures, were, transferred, from, toyosukiirihime, to, suinin, s, daughter, yamatohime, who, took, them, first, to, sasahata, in, uda, to, the, east, of, miwa, heading, north, to, mi, she, then, eastwards, to, mino, and, proceeded, south, to, ise, where, she, received, a, revelation, from, amaterasu, now, ama, terasu, no, oho, kami, instructed, yamato, hime, no, mikoto, saying, the, province, of, ise, of, the, divine, wind, is, the, land, whither, repair, the, waves, from, the, eternal, world, the, successive, waves, it, is, a, secluded, and, pleasant, land, in, this, land, i, wish, to, dwell, in, compliance, therefore, with, the, instruction, of, the, great, goddess, a, shrine, was, erected, to, her, in, the, province, of, ise, accordingly, an, abstinence, palace, was, built, at, kaha, kami, in, isuzu, this, was, called, the, palace, of, iso, it, was, there, that, ama, terasu, no, oho, kami, first, descended, from, heaven, this, account, serves, as, the, origin, myth, of, the, grand, shrine, of, ise, amaterasu, s, chief, place, of, worship, later, when, suinin, s, grandson, prince, ousu, also, known, as, yamato, takeru, went, to, ise, to, visit, his, aunt, yamatohime, before, going, to, conquer, and, pacify, the, eastern, regions, on, the, command, of, his, father, emperor, keik, he, was, given, the, divine, sword, to, protect, him, in, times, of, peril, it, eventually, came, in, handy, when, yamato, takeru, was, lured, onto, an, open, grassland, by, a, treacherous, chieftain, who, then, set, fire, to, the, grass, to, entrap, him, desperate, yamato, takeru, used, the, sword, to, cut, the, grass, around, him, a, variant, in, the, shoki, has, the, sword, miraculously, mow, the, grass, of, its, own, accord, and, lit, a, counter, fire, to, keep, the, fire, away, this, incident, explains, the, sword, s, name, grass, cutter, on, his, way, home, from, the, east, yamato, takeru, apparently, blinded, by, hubris, left, the, kusanagi, in, the, care, of, his, second, wife, miyazuhime, of, owari, and, went, to, confront, the, god, of, mount, ibuki, on, his, own, without, the, sword, s, protection, he, fell, prey, to, the, god, s, enchantment, and, became, ill, and, died, afterwards, thus, the, kusanagi, stayed, in, owari, where, it, was, enshrined, in, the, shrine, of, atsuta, at, one, time, when, emperor, ch, ai, was, on, a, campaign, against, the, kumaso, tribes, of, kyushu, his, consort, jing, was, possessed, by, unknown, gods, who, told, ch, ai, of, a, land, rich, in, treasure, located, on,

records, of, a, shrine, on, tsushima, island, coined, as, either, teruhi, gongen, or, the, shining, sun, deity, during, medieval, times, it, was, later, found, that, such, a, shrine, was, meant, for, a, male, sun, deity, named, ameno, himitama, amaterasu, was, also, once, worshiped, at, hinokuma, shrines, the, hinokuma, shrines, were, used, to, worship, the, goddess, by, the, ama, people, in, the, kii, provinces, because, the, ama, people, were, believed, to, have, been, fishermen, researchers, have, conjectured, that, the, goddess, was, also, worshiped, for, a, possible, connection, to, the, sea, amaterasu, was, thought, by, some, in, the, early, 20th, century, until, after, world, war, ii, to, have, created, the, japanese, archipelago, from, the, drops, of, water, that, fell, from, her, spear, and, in, historic, times, the, spear, was, an, item, compared, to, the, sun, and, solar, deities, amaterasu, while, primarily, being, the, goddess, of, the, sun, is, also, sometimes, worshiped, as, having, connections, with, other, aspects, and, forms, of, nature, amaterasu, can, also, be, considered, a, goddess, of, the, wind, and, typhoons, alongside, her, brother, and, even, possibly, death, there, are, many, connections, between, local, legends, in, the, ise, region, with, other, goddesses, of, nature, such, as, a, nameless, goddess, of, the, underworld, and, sea, it, is, possible, that, amaterasu, s, name, became, associated, with, these, legends, in, the, shinto, religion, as, it, grew, throughout, japan, one, source, interprets, from, the, heavenly, rock, cave, myth, that, amaterasu, was, seen, as, being, responsible, for, the, normal, cycle, of, day, and, night, a, historical, myth, holds, that, she, painted, the, islands, of, japan, into, being, alongside, her, siblings, susanoo, and, tsukuyomi, in, contrast, amaterasu, while, enshrined, at, other, locations, also, can, be, seen, as, the, goddess, that, represents, japan, and, its, ethnicity, the, many, differences, in, shinto, religion, and, mythology, can, be, due, to, how, different, local, gods, and, beliefs, clashed, in, the, meiji, era, the, belief, in, amaterasu, fought, against, the, izumo, belief, in, kuninushi, for, spiritual, control, over, the, land, of, japan, during, this, time, the, religious, nature, of, okininushi, may, have, been, changed, to, be, included, in, shinto, mythology, osagawara, shouzo, built, shrines, in, other, countries, to, mainly, spread, japan, s, culture, and, shinto, religion, it, however, was, usually, seen, as, the, worshiping, of, japan, itself, rather, than, amaterasu, most, of, these, colonial, and, oversea, shrines, were, destroyed, after, wwii, outside, of, being, worshiped, as, a, sun, goddess, some, have, argued, that, amaterasu, was, once, related, to, snakes, there, was, a, legend, circulating, among, the, ise, priests, that, essentially, described, an, encounter, of, amaterasu, sleeping, with, the, sai, every, night, in, the, form, of, a, snake, or, lizard, evidenced, by, fallen, scales, in, the, priestess, bed, this, was, recorded, by, a, medieval, monk, in, his, diary, which, stated, that, in, ancient, times, amaterasu, was, regarded, as, a, snake, deity, or, as, a, sun, deity, in, the, ise, kanj, the, god, s, snake, form, is, considered, an, embodiment, of, the, three, poisons, namely, greed, anger, and, ignorance, amaterasu, is, also, linked, to, a, snake, cult, which, is, also, tied, to, the, theory, that, the, initial, gender, of, the, goddess, was, male, in, general, some, of, these, amaterasu, dragon, associations, have, been, in, reference, to, japanese, plays, one, example, has, been, within, the, chikubushima, tradition, in, which, the, dragon, goddess, benzaiten, was, the, emanation, of, amaterasu, following, that, in, the, japanese, epic, taiheki, one, of, the, characters, nitta, yoshisada, made, comparisons, with, amaterasu, and, a, dragon, with, the, quote, i, have, heard, that, the, sun, goddess, of, ise, conceals, her, true, being, in, the, august, image, of, vairocana, and, that, she, has, appeared, in, this, world, in, the, guise, of, a, dragon, god, of, the, blue, ocean, another, tradition, of, the, heavenly, cave, story, depicts, amaterasu, as, a, dragon, fox, shinko, or, tatsugitsune, during, her, descent, to, the, famed, cave, because, it, is, a, type, of, animal, kami, that, emits, light, from, its, entire, body, because, amaterasu, has, the, highest, position, among, the, shinto, deities, there, has, been, debate, on, her, influence, and, relation, to, women, s, positions, in, early, japanese, society, some, scholars, have, argued, that, the, goddess, presence, and, high, stature, within, the, kami, system, could, suggest, that, early, rulers, in, japan, were, female, others, have, argued, the, goddess, presence, implies, strong, influences, female, priests, had, in, japanese, politics, and, religion
