causality, is, the, relationship, between, causes, and, effects, while, causality, is, also, a, topic, studied, from, the, perspectives, of, philosophy, and, physics, it, is, operationalized, so, that, causes, of, an, event, must, be, in, the, past, light, cone, of, the, event, and, ultimately, reducible, to, fundamental, interactions, similarly, a, cause, cannot, have, an, effect, outside, its, future, light, cone, causality, can, be, defined, macroscopically, at, the, level, of, human, observers, or, microscopically, for, fundamental, events, at, the, atomic, level, the, strong, causality, principle, forbids, information, transfer, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, the, weak, causality, principle, operates, at, the, microscopic, level, and, need, not, lead, to, information, transfer, physical, models, can, obey, the, weak, principle, without, obeying, the, strong, version, in, classical, physics, an, effect, cannot, occur, before, its, cause, which, is, why, solutions, such, as, the, advanced, time, solutions, of, the, li, nard, wiechert, potential, are, discarded, as, physically, meaningless, in, both, einstein, s, theory, of, special, and, general, relativity, causality, means, that, an, effect, cannot, occur, from, a, cause, that, is, not, in, the, back, past, light, cone, of, that, event, similarly, a, cause, cannot, have, an, effect, outside, its, front, future, light, cone, these, restrictions, are, consistent, with, the, constraint, that, mass, and, energy, that, act, as, causal, influences, cannot, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, and, or, backwards, in, time, in, quantum, field, theory, observables, of, events, with, a, spacelike, relationship, elsewhere, have, to, commute, so, the, order, of, observations, or, measurements, of, such, observables, do, not, impact, each, other, another, requirement, of, causality, is, that, cause, and, effect, be, mediated, across, space, and, time, requirement, of, contiguity, this, requirement, has, been, very, influential, in, the, past, in, the, first, place, as, a, result, of, direct, observation, of, causal, processes, like, pushing, a, cart, in, the, second, place, as, a, problematic, aspect, of, newton, s, theory, of, gravitation, attraction, of, the, earth, by, the, sun, by, means, of, action, at, a, distance, replacing, mechanistic, proposals, like, descartes, vortex, theory, in, the, third, place, as, an, incentive, to, develop, dynamic, field, theories, e, g, maxwell, s, electrodynamics, and, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, restoring, contiguity, in, the, transmission, of, influences, in, a, more, successful, way, than, in, descartes, theory, in, modern, physics, the, notion, of, causality, had, to, be, clarified, the, word, simultaneous, is, observer, dependent, in, special, relativity, the, principle, is, relativity, of, simultaneity, consequently, the, relativistic, principle, of, causality, says, that, the, cause, must, precede, its, effect, according, to, all, inertial, observers, this, is, equivalent, to, the, statement, that, the, cause, and, its, effect, are, separated, by, a, timelike, interval, and, the, effect, belongs, to, the, future, of, its, cause, if, a, timelike, interval, separates, the, two, events, this, means, that, a, signal, could, be, sent, between, them, at, less, than, the, speed, of, light, on, the, other, hand, if, signals, could, move, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, this, would, violate, causality, because, it, would, allow, a, signal, to, be, sent, across, spacelike, intervals, which, means, that, at, least, to, some, inertial, observers, the, signal, would, travel, backward, in, time, for, this, reason, special, relativity, does, not, allow, communication, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, in, the, theory, of, general, relativity, the, concept, of, causality, is, generalized, in, the, most, straightforward, way, the, effect, must, belong, to, the, future, light, cone, of, its, cause, even, if, the, spacetime, is, curved, new, subtleties, must, be, taken, into, account, when, we, investigate, causality, in, quantum, mechanics, and, relativistic, quantum, field, theory, in, particular, in, those, two, theories, causality, is, closely, related, to, the, principle, of, locality, bell, s, theorem, shows, that, conditions, of, local, causality, in, experiments, involving, quantum, entanglement, result, in, non, classical, correlations, predicted, by, quantum, mechanics, despite, these, subtleties, causality, remains, an, important, and, valid, concept, in, physical, theories, for, example, the, notion, that, events, can, be, ordered, into, causes, and, effects, is, necessary, to, prevent, or, at, least, outline, causality, paradoxes, such, as, the, grandfather, paradox, which, asks, what, happens, if, a, time, traveler, kills, his, own, grandfather, before, he, ever, meets, the, time, traveler, s, grandmother, see, also, chronology, protection, conjecture, the, word, causality, in, this, context, means, that, all, effects, must, have, specific, physical, causes, due, to, fundamental, interactions, causality, in, this, context, is, not, associated, with, definitional, principles, such, as, newton, s, second, law, as, such, in, the, context, of, causality, a, force, does, not, cause, a, mass, to, accelerate, nor, vice, versa, rather, newton, s, second, law, can, be, derived, from, the, conservation, of, momentum, which, itself, is, a, consequence, of, the, spatial, homogeneity, of, physical, laws, the, empiricists, aversion, to, metaphysical, explanations, like, descartes, vortex, theory, meant, that, scholastic, arguments, about, what, caused, phenomena, were, either, rejected, for, being, untestable, or, were, just, ignored, the, complaint, that, physics, does, not, explain, the, cause, of, phenomena, has, accordingly, been, dismissed, as, a, problem, that, is, philosophical, or, metaphysical, rather, than, empirical, e, g, newton, s, hypotheses, non, fingo, according, to, ernst, mach, the, notion, of, force, in, newton, s, second, law, was, pleonastic, tautological, and, superfluous, and, as, indicated, above, is, not, considered, a, consequence, of, any, principle, of, causality, indeed, it, is, possible, to, consider, the, newtonian, equations, of, motion, of, the, gravitational, interaction, of, two, bodies, as, two, coupled, equations, describing, the, positions, r, 1, t, displaystyle, scriptstyle, mathbf, r, 1, t, and, r, 2, t, displaystyle, scriptstyle, mathbf, r, 2, t, of, the, two, bodies, without, interpreting, the, right, hand, sides, of, these, equations, as, forces, the, equations, just, describe, a, process, of, interaction, without, any, necessity, to, interpret, one, body, as, the, cause, of, the, motion, of, the, other, and, allow, one, to, predict, the, states, of, the, system, at, later, as, well, as, earlier, times, the, ordinary, situations, in, which, humans, singled, out, some, factors, in, a, physical, interaction, as, being, prior, and, therefore, supplying, the, because, of, the, interaction, were, often, ones, in, which, humans, decided, to, bring, about, some, state, of, affairs, and, directed, their, energies, to, producing, that, state, of, affairs, a, process, that, took, time, to, establish, and, left, a, new, state, of, affairs, that, persisted, beyond, the, time, of, activity, of, the, actor, it, would, be, difficult, and, pointless, however, to, explain, the, motions, of, binary, stars, with, respect, to, each, other, in, that, way, which, indeed, are, time, reversible, and, agnostic, to, the, arrow, of, time, but, with, such, a, direction, of, time, established, the, entire, evolution, system, could, then, be, completely, determined, the, possibility, of, such, a, time, independent, view, is, at, the, basis, of, the, deductive, nomological, d, n, view, of, scientific, explanation, considering, an, event, to, be, explained, if, it, can, be, subsumed, under, a, scientific, law, in, the, d, n, view, a, physical, state, is, considered, to, be, explained, if, applying, the, deterministic, law, it, can, be, derived, from, given, initial, conditions, such, initial, conditions, could, include, the, momenta, and, distance, from, each, other, of, binary, stars, at, any, given, moment, such, explanation, by, determinism, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, causal, determinism, a, disadvantage, of, the, d, n, view, is, that, causality, and, determinism, are, more, or, less, identified, thus, in, classical, physics, it, was, assumed, that, all, events, are, caused, by, earlier, ones, according, to, the, known, laws, of, nature, culminating, in, pierre, simon, laplace, s, claim, that, if, the, current, state, of, the, world, were, known, with, precision, it, could, be, computed, for, any, time, in, the, future, or, the, past, see, laplace, s, demon, however, this, is, usually, referred, to, as, laplace, determinism, rather, than, laplace, causality, because, it, hinges, on, determinism, in, mathematical, models, as, dealt, with, in, the, mathematical, cauchy, problem, confusion, between, causality, and, determinism, is, particularly, acute, in, quantum, mechanics, this, theory, being, acausal, in, the, sense, that, it, is, unable, in, many, cases, to, identify, the, causes, of, actually, observed, effects, or, to, predict, the, effects, of, identical, causes, but, arguably, deterministic, in, some, interpretations, e, g, if, the, wave, function, is, presumed, not, to, actually, collapse, as, in, the, many, worlds, interpretation, or, if, its, collapse, is, due, to, hidden, variables, or, simply, redefining, determinism, as, meaning, that, probabilities, rather, than, specific, effects, are, determined, theories, in, physics, like, the, butterfly, effect, from, chaos, theory, open, up, the, possibility, of, a, type, of, distributed, parameter, systems, in, causality, the, butterfly, effect, theory, proposes, small, variations, of, the, initial, condition, of, a, nonlinear, dynamical, system, may, produce, large, variations, in, the, long, term, behavior, of, the, system, this, opens, up, the, opportunity, to, understand, a, distributed, causality, a, related, way, to, interpret, the, butterfly, effect, is, to, see, it, as, highlighting, the, difference, between, the, application, of, the, notion, of, causality, in, physics, and, a, more, general, use, of, causality, as, represented, by, mackie, s, inus, conditions, in, classical, newtonian, physics, in, general, only, those, conditions, are, explicitly, taken, into, account, that, are, both, necessary, and, sufficient, for, instance, when, a, massive, sphere, is, caused, to, roll, down, a, slope, starting, from, a, point, of, unstable, equilibrium, then, its, velocity, is, assumed, to, be, caused, by, the, force, of, gravity, accelerating, it, the, small, push, that, was, needed, to, set, it, into, motion, is, not, explicitly, dealt, with, as, a, cause, in, order, to, be, a, physical, cause, there, must, be, a, certain, proportionality, with, the, ensuing, effect, a, distinction, is, drawn, between, triggering, and, causation, of, the, ball, s, motion, by, the, same, token, the, butterfly, can, be, seen, as, triggering, a, tornado, its, cause, being, assumed, to, be, seated, in, the, atmospherical, energies, already, present, beforehand, rather, than, in, the, movements, of, a, butterfly, in, causal, set, theory, causality, takes, an, even, more, prominent, place, the, basis, for, this, approach, to, quantum, gravity, is, in, a, theorem, by, david, malament, this, theorem, states, that, the, causal, structure, of, a, spacetime, suffices, to, reconstruct, its, conformal, class, so, knowing, the, conformal, factor, and, the, causal, structure, is, enough, to, know, the, spacetime, based, on, this, rafael, sorkin, proposed, the, idea, of, causal, set, theory, which, is, a, fundamentally, discrete, approach, to, quantum, gravity, the, causal, structure, of, the, spacetime, is, represented, as, a, poset, while, the, conformal, factor, can, be, reconstructed, by, identifying, each, poset, element, with, a, unit, volume
