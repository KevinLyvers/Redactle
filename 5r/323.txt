folklore, is, the, body, of, expressive, culture, shared, by, a, particular, group, of, people, culture, or, subculture, this, includes, oral, traditions, such, as, tales, myths, legends, proverbs, poems, jokes, and, other, oral, traditions, this, also, includes, material, culture, such, as, traditional, building, styles, common, to, the, group, folklore, also, encompasses, customary, lore, taking, actions, for, folk, beliefs, and, the, forms, and, rituals, of, celebrations, such, as, christmas, weddings, folk, dances, and, initiation, rites, each, one, of, these, either, singly, or, in, combination, is, considered, a, folklore, artifact, or, traditional, cultural, expression, just, as, essential, as, the, form, folklore, also, encompasses, the, transmission, of, these, artifacts, from, one, region, to, another, or, from, one, generation, to, the, next, folklore, is, not, something, one, can, typically, gain, from, a, formal, school, curriculum, or, study, in, the, fine, arts, instead, these, traditions, are, passed, along, informally, from, one, individual, to, another, either, through, verbal, instruction, or, demonstration, the, academic, study, of, folklore, is, called, folklore, studies, or, folkloristics, and, it, can, be, explored, at, the, undergraduate, graduate, and, ph, d, levels, the, word, folklore, a, compound, of, folk, and, lore, was, coined, in, 1846, by, the, englishman, william, thoms, who, contrived, the, term, as, a, replacement, for, the, contemporary, terminology, of, popular, antiquities, or, popular, literature, the, second, half, of, the, word, lore, comes, from, old, english, l, r, instruction, it, is, the, knowledge, and, traditions, of, a, particular, group, frequently, passed, along, by, word, of, mouth, the, concept, of, folk, has, varied, over, time, when, thoms, first, created, this, term, folk, applied, only, to, rural, frequently, poor, and, illiterate, peasants, a, more, modern, definition, of, folk, is, a, social, group, that, includes, two, or, more, people, with, common, traits, who, express, their, shared, identity, through, distinctive, traditions, folk, is, a, flexible, concept, which, can, refer, to, a, nation, as, in, american, folklore, or, to, a, single, family, this, expanded, social, definition, of, folk, supports, a, broader, view, of, the, material, i, e, the, lore, considered, to, be, folklore, artifacts, these, now, include, all, things, people, make, with, words, verbal, lore, things, they, make, with, their, hands, material, lore, and, things, they, make, with, their, actions, customary, lore, folklore, is, no, longer, considered, to, be, limited, to, that, which, is, old, or, obsolete, these, folk, artifacts, continue, to, be, passed, along, informally, as, a, rule, anonymously, and, always, in, multiple, variants, the, folk, group, is, not, individualistic, it, is, community, based, and, nurtures, its, lore, in, community, as, new, groups, emerge, new, folklore, is, created, surfers, motorcyclists, computer, programmers, in, direct, contrast, to, high, culture, where, any, single, work, of, a, named, artist, is, protected, by, copyright, law, folklore, is, a, function, of, shared, identity, within, a, common, social, group, having, identified, folk, artifacts, the, professional, folklorist, strives, to, understand, the, significance, of, these, beliefs, customs, and, objects, for, the, group, since, these, cultural, units, would, not, be, passed, along, unless, they, had, some, continued, relevance, within, the, group, that, meaning, can, however, shift, and, morph, for, example, the, halloween, celebration, of, the, 21st, century, is, not, the, all, hallows, eve, of, the, middle, ages, and, even, gives, rise, to, its, own, set, of, urban, legends, independent, of, the, historical, celebration, the, cleansing, rituals, of, orthodox, judaism, were, originally, good, public, health, in, a, land, with, little, water, but, now, these, customs, signify, for, some, people, identification, as, an, orthodox, jew, by, comparison, a, common, action, such, as, tooth, brushing, which, is, also, transmitted, within, a, group, remains, a, practical, hygiene, and, health, issue, and, does, not, rise, to, the, level, of, a, group, defining, tradition, tradition, is, initially, remembered, behavior, once, it, loses, its, practical, purpose, there, is, no, reason, for, further, transmission, unless, it, has, been, imbued, with, meaning, beyond, the, initial, practicality, of, the, action, this, meaning, is, at, the, core, of, folkloristics, the, study, of, folklore, with, the, increasing, theoretical, sophistication, of, the, social, sciences, it, has, become, evident, that, folklore, is, a, naturally, occurring, and, necessary, component, of, any, social, group, it, is, indeed, all, around, us, folklore, does, not, have, to, be, old, or, antiquated, it, continues, to, be, created, and, transmitted, and, in, any, group, it, is, used, to, differentiate, between, us, and, them, folklore, began, to, distinguish, itself, as, an, autonomous, discipline, during, the, period, of, romantic, nationalism, in, europe, a, particular, figure, in, this, development, was, johann, gottfried, von, herder, whose, writings, in, the, 1770s, presented, oral, traditions, as, organic, processes, grounded, in, locale, after, the, german, states, were, invaded, by, napoleonic, france, herder, s, approach, was, adopted, by, many, of, his, fellow, germans, who, systematized, the, recorded, folk, traditions, and, used, them, in, their, process, of, nation, building, this, process, was, enthusiastically, embraced, by, smaller, nations, like, finland, estonia, and, hungary, which, were, seeking, political, independence, from, their, dominant, neighbors, folklore, as, a, field, of, study, further, developed, among, 19th, century, european, scholars, who, were, contrasting, tradition, with, the, newly, developing, modernity, its, focus, was, the, oral, folklore, of, the, rural, peasant, populations, which, were, considered, as, residue, and, survivals, of, the, past, that, continued, to, exist, within, the, lower, strata, of, society, the, kinder, und, hausm, rchen, of, the, brothers, grimm, first, published, 1812, is, the, best, known, but, by, no, means, only, collection, of, verbal, folklore, of, the, european, peasantry, of, that, time, this, interest, in, stories, sayings, and, songs, continued, throughout, the, 19th, century, and, aligned, the, fledgling, discipline, of, folkloristics, with, literature, and, mythology, by, the, turn, into, the, 20th, century, the, number, and, sophistication, of, folklore, studies, and, folklorists, had, grown, both, in, europe, and, north, america, whereas, european, folklorists, remained, focused, on, the, oral, folklore, of, the, homogenous, peasant, populations, in, their, regions, the, american, folklorists, led, by, franz, boas, and, ruth, benedict, chose, to, consider, native, american, cultures, in, their, research, and, included, the, totality, of, their, customs, and, beliefs, as, folklore, this, distinction, aligned, american, folkloristics, with, cultural, anthropology, and, ethnology, using, the, same, techniques, of, data, collection, in, their, field, research, this, divided, alliance, of, folkloristics, between, the, humanities, in, europe, and, the, social, sciences, in, america, offers, a, wealth, of, theoretical, vantage, points, and, research, tools, to, the, field, of, folkloristics, as, a, whole, even, as, it, continues, to, be, a, point, of, discussion, within, the, field, itself, the, term, folkloristics, along, with, the, alternative, name, folklore, studies, became, widely, used, in, the, 1950s, to, distinguish, the, academic, study, of, traditional, culture, from, the, folklore, artifacts, themselves, when, the, american, folklife, preservation, act, public, law, 94, 201, was, passed, by, the, u, s, congress, in, january, 1976, to, coincide, with, the, bicentennial, celebration, folkloristics, in, the, united, states, came, of, age, means, the, traditional, expressive, culture, shared, within, the, various, groups, in, the, united, states, familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional, expressive, culture, includes, a, wide, range, of, creative, and, symbolic, forms, such, as, custom, belief, technical, skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft, these, expressions, are, mainly, learned, orally, by, imitation, or, in, performance, and, are, generally, maintained, without, benefit, of, formal, instruction, or, institutional, direction, added, to, the, extensive, array, of, other, legislation, designed, to, protect, the, natural, and, cultural, heritage, of, the, united, states, this, law, also, marks, a, shift, in, national, awareness, it, gives, voice, to, a, growing, understanding, that, cultural, diversity, is, a, national, strength, and, a, resource, worthy, of, protection, paradoxically, it, is, a, unifying, feature, not, something, that, separates, the, citizens, of, a, country, we, no, longer, view, cultural, difference, as, a, problem, to, be, solved, but, as, a, tremendous, opportunity, in, the, diversity, of, american, folklife, we, find, a, marketplace, teeming, with, the, exchange, of, traditional, forms, and, cultural, ideas, a, rich, resource, for, americans, this, diversity, is, celebrated, annually, at, the, smithsonian, folklife, festival, and, many, other, folklife, fests, around, the, country, there, are, numerous, other, definitions, according, to, william, bascom, major, article, on, the, topic, there, are, four, functions, to, folklore, the, folk, of, the, 19th, century, the, social, group, identified, in, the, original, term, folklore, was, characterized, by, being, rural, illiterate, and, poor, they, were, the, peasants, living, in, the, countryside, in, contrast, to, the, urban, populace, of, the, cities, only, toward, the, end, of, the, century, did, the, urban, proletariat, on, the, coattails, of, marxist, theory, become, included, with, the, rural, poor, as, folk, the, common, feature, in, this, expanded, definition, of, folk, was, their, identification, as, the, underclass, of, society, moving, forward, into, the, 20th, century, in, tandem, with, new, thinking, in, the, social, sciences, folklorists, also, revised, and, expanded, their, concept, of, the, folk, group, by, the, 1960s, it, was, understood, that, social, groups, i, e, folk, groups, were, all, around, us, each, individual, is, enmeshed, in, a, multitude, of, differing, identities, and, their, concomitant, social, groups, the, first, group, that, each, of, us, is, born, into, is, the, family, and, each, family, has, its, own, unique, family, folklore, as, a, child, grows, into, an, individual, its, identities, also, increase, to, include, age, language, ethnicity, occupation, etc, each, of, these, cohorts, has, its, own, folklore, and, as, one, folklorist, points, out, this, is, not, idle, speculation, decades, of, fieldwork, have, demonstrated, conclusively, that, these, groups, do, have, their, own, folklore, in, this, modern, understanding, folklore, is, a, function, of, shared, identity, within, any, social, group, this, folklore, can, include, jokes, sayings, and, expected, behavior, in, multiple, variants, always, transmitted, in, an, informal, manner, for, the, most, part, it, will, be, learned, by, observation, imitation, repetition, or, correction, by, other, group, members, this, informal, knowledge, is, used, to, confirm, and, re, inforce, the, identity, of, the, group, it, can, be, used, both, internally, within, the, group, to, express, their, common, identity, for, example, in, an, initiation, ceremony, for, new, members, or, it, can, be, used, externally, to, differentiate, the, group, from, outsiders, like, a, folkdance, demonstration, at, a, community, festival, significant, to, folklorists, here, is, that, there, are, two, opposing, but, equally, valid, ways, to, use, this, in, the, study, of, a, group, you, can, start, with, an, identified, group, in, order, to, explore, its, folklore, or, you, can, identify, folklore, items, and, use, them, to, identify, the, social, group, beginning, in, the, 1960s, a, further, expansion, of, the, concept, of, folk, began, to, unfold, through, the, study, of, folklore, individual, researchers, identified, folk, groups, that, had, previously, been, overlooked, and, ignored, one, notable, example, of, this, is, found, in, an, issue, of, the, journal, of, american, folklore, published, in, 1975, which, is, dedicated, exclusively, to, articles, on, women, s, folklore, with, approaches, that, had, not, come, from, a, man, s, perspective, other, groups, that, were, highlighted, as, part, of, this, broadened, understanding, of, the, folk, group, were, non, traditional, families, occupational, groups, and, families, that, pursued, the, production, of, folk, items, over, multiple, generations, folklorist, richard, dorson, explained, in, 1976, that, the, study, of, folklore, is, concerned, with, the, study, of, traditional, culture, or, the, unofficial, culture, that, is, the, folk, culture, as, opposed, to, the, elite, culture, not, for, the, sake, of, proving, a, thesis, but, to, learn, about, the, mass, of, overlooked, by, the, conventional, disciplines, individual, folklore, artifacts, are, commonly, classified, as, one, of, three, types, material, verbal, or, customary, lore, for, the, most, part, self, explanatory, these, categories, include, physical, objects, material, folklore, common, sayings, expressions, stories, and, songs, verbal, folklore, and, beliefs, and, ways, of, doing, things, customary, folklore, there, is, also, a, fourth, major, subgenre, defined, for, children, s, folklore, and, games, childlore, as, the, collection, and, interpretation, of, this, fertile, topic, is, particular, to, school, yards, and, neighborhood, streets, each, of, these, genres, and, their, subtypes, is, intended, to, organize, and, categorize, the, folklore, artifacts, they, provide, common, vocabulary, and, consistent, labeling, for, folklorists, to, communicate, with, each, other, that, said, each, artifact, is, unique, in, fact, one, of, the, characteristics, of, all, folklore, artifacts, is, their, variation, within, genres, and, types, this, is, in, direct, contrast, to, manufactured, goods, where, the, goal, in, production, is, to, create, identical, products, and, any, variations, are, considered, mistakes, it, is, however, just, this, required, variation, that, makes, identification, and, classification, of, the, defining, features, a, challenge, and, while, this, classification, is, essential, for, the, subject, area, of, folkloristics, it, remains, just, labeling, and, adds, little, to, an, understanding, of, the, traditional, development, and, meaning, of, the, artifacts, themselves, necessary, as, they, are, genre, classifications, are, misleading, in, their, oversimplification, of, the, subject, area, folklore, artifacts, are, never, self, contained, they, do, not, stand, in, isolation, but, are, particulars, in, the, self, representation, of, a, community, different, genres, are, frequently, combined, with, each, other, to, mark, an, event, so, a, birthday, celebration, might, include, a, song, or, formulaic, way, of, greeting, the, birthday, child, verbal, presentation, of, a, cake, and, wrapped, presents, material, as, well, as, customs, to, honor, the, individual, such, as, sitting, at, the, head, of, the, table, and, blowing, out, the, candles, with, a, wish, there, might, also, be, special, games, played, at, birthday, parties, which, are, not, generally, played, at, other, times, adding, to, the, complexity, of, the, interpretation, the, birthday, party, for, a, seven, year, old, will, not, be, identical, to, the, birthday, party, for, that, same, child, as, a, six, year, old, even, though, they, follow, the, same, model, for, each, artifact, embodies, a, single, variant, of, a, performance, in, a, given, time, and, space, the, task, of, the, folklorist, becomes, to, identify, within, this, surfeit, of, variables, the, constants, and, the, expressed, meaning, that, shimmer, through, all, variations, honoring, of, the, individual, within, the, circle, of, family, and, friends, gifting, to, express, their, value, and, worth, to, the, group, and, of, course, the, festival, food, and, drink, as, signifiers, of, the, event, the, formal, definition, of, verbal, lore, is, words, both, written, and, oral, that, are, spoken, sung, voiced, forms, of, traditional, utterance, that, show, repetitive, patterns, crucial, here, are, the, repetitive, patterns, verbal, lore, is, not, just, any, conversation, but, words, and, phrases, conforming, to, a, traditional, configuration, recognized, by, both, the, speaker, and, the, audience, for, narrative, types, by, definition, have, consistent, structure, and, follow, an, existing, model, in, their, narrative, form, as, just, one, simple, example, in, english, the, phrase, an, elephant, walks, into, a, bar, instantaneously, flags, the, following, text, as, a, joke, it, might, be, one, you, have, already, heard, but, it, might, be, one, that, the, speaker, has, just, thought, up, within, the, current, context, another, example, is, the, child, s, song, old, macdonald, had, a, farm, where, each, performance, is, distinctive, in, the, animals, named, their, order, and, their, sounds, songs, such, as, this, are, used, to, express, cultural, values, farms, are, important, farmers, are, old, and, weather, beaten, and, teach, children, about, different, domesticated, animals, verbal, folklore, was, the, original, folklore, the, artifacts, defined, by, william, thoms, as, older, oral, cultural, traditions, of, the, rural, populace, in, his, 1846, published, call, for, help, in, documenting, antiquities, thoms, was, echoing, scholars, from, across, the, european, continent, to, collect, artifacts, of, verbal, lore, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, these, collections, had, grown, to, include, artifacts, from, around, the, world, and, across, several, centuries, a, system, to, organize, and, categorize, them, became, necessary, antti, aarne, published, a, first, classification, system, for, folktales, in, 1910, this, was, later, expanded, into, the, aarne, thompson, classification, system, by, stith, thompson, and, remains, the, standard, classification, system, for, european, folktales, and, other, types, of, oral, literature, as, the, number, of, classified, oral, artifacts, grew, similarities, were, noted, in, items, that, had, been, collected, from, very, different, geographic, regions, ethnic, groups, and, epochs, giving, rise, to, the, historic, geographic, method, a, methodology, that, dominated, folkloristics, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, when, william, thoms, first, published, his, appeal, to, document, the, verbal, lore, of, the, rural, populations, it, was, believed, these, folk, artifacts, would, die, out, as, the, population, became, literate, over, the, past, two, centuries, this, belief, has, proven, to, be, wrong, folklorists, continue, to, collect, verbal, lore, in, both, written, and, spoken, form, from, all, social, groups, some, variants, might, have, been, captured, in, published, collections, but, much, of, it, is, still, transmitted, orally, and, indeed, continues, to, be, generated, in, new, forms, and, variants, at, an, alarming, rate, below, is, listed, a, small, sampling, of, types, and, examples, of, verbal, lore, the, genre, of, material, culture, includes, all, artifacts, that, can, be, touched, held, lived, in, or, eaten, they, are, tangible, objects, with, a, physical, or, mental, presence, either, intended, for, permanent, use, or, to, be, used, at, the, next, meal, most, of, these, folklore, artifacts, are, single, objects, that, have, been, created, by, hand, for, a, specific, purpose, however, folk, artifacts, can, also, be, mass, produced, such, as, dreidels, or, christmas, decorations, these, items, continue, to, be, considered, folklore, because, of, their, long, pre, industrial, history, and, their, customary, use, all, of, these, material, objects, existed, prior, to, and, continue, alongside, mechanized, industry, transmitted, across, the, generations, and, subject, to, the, same, forces, of, conservative, tradition, and, individual, variation, that, are, found, in, all, folk, artifacts, folklorists, are, interested, in, the, physical, form, the, method, of, manufacture, or, construction, the, pattern, of, use, as, well, as, the, procurement, of, the, raw, materials, the, meaning, to, those, who, both, make, and, use, these, objects, is, important, of, primary, significance, in, these, studies, is, the, complex, balance, of, continuity, over, change, in, both, their, design, and, their, decoration, in, europe, prior, to, the, industrial, revolution, everything, was, made, by, hand, while, some, folklorists, of, the, 19th, century, wanted, to, secure, the, oral, traditions, of, the, rural, folk, before, the, populace, became, literate, other, folklorists, sought, to, identify, hand, crafted, objects, before, their, production, processes, were, lost, to, industrial, manufacturing, just, as, verbal, lore, continues, to, be, actively, created, and, transmitted, in, today, s, culture, so, these, handicrafts, can, still, be, found, all, around, us, with, possibly, a, shift, in, purpose, and, meaning, there, are, many, reasons, for, continuing, to, handmake, objects, for, use, for, example, these, skills, may, be, needed, to, repair, manufactured, items, or, a, unique, design, might, be, required, which, is, not, or, cannot, be, found, in, the, stores, many, crafts, are, considered, as, simple, home, maintenance, such, as, cooking, sewing, and, carpentry, for, many, people, handicrafts, have, also, become, an, enjoyable, and, satisfying, hobby, handmade, objects, are, often, regarded, as, prestigious, where, extra, time, and, thought, is, spent, in, their, creation, and, their, uniqueness, is, valued, for, the, folklorist, these, hand, crafted, objects, embody, multifaceted, relationships, in, the, lives, of, the, craftspeople, and, the, users, a, concept, that, has, been, lost, with, mass, produced, items, that, have, no, connection, to, an, individual, craftsperson, many, traditional, crafts, such, as, ironworking, and, glass, making, have, been, elevated, to, the, fine, or, applied, arts, and, taught, in, art, schools, or, they, have, been, repurposed, as, folk, art, characterized, as, objects, whose, decorative, form, supersedes, their, utilitarian, needs, folk, art, is, found, in, hex, signs, on, pennsylvania, dutch, barns, tin, man, sculptures, made, by, metalworkers, front, yard, christmas, displays, decorated, school, lockers, carved, gun, stocks, and, tattoos, words, such, as, naive, self, taught, and, individualistic, are, used, to, describe, these, objects, and, the, exceptional, rather, than, the, representative, creation, is, featured, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, understanding, of, folklore, artifacts, that, are, nurtured, and, passed, along, within, a, community, many, objects, of, material, folklore, are, challenging, to, classify, difficult, to, archive, and, unwieldy, to, store, the, assigned, task, of, museums, is, to, preserve, and, make, use, of, these, bulky, artifacts, of, material, culture, to, this, end, the, concept, of, the, living, museum, has, developed, beginning, in, scandinavia, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, these, open, air, museums, not, only, display, the, artifacts, but, also, teach, visitors, how, the, items, were, used, with, actors, reenacting, the, everyday, lives, of, people, from, all, segments, of, society, relying, heavily, on, the, material, artifacts, of, a, pre, industrial, society, many, locations, even, duplicate, the, processing, of, the, objects, thus, creating, new, objects, of, an, earlier, historic, time, period, living, museums, are, now, found, throughout, the, world, as, part, of, a, thriving, heritage, industry, this, list, represents, just, a, small, sampling, of, objects, and, skills, that, are, included, in, studies, of, material, culture, customary, culture, is, remembered, enactment, i, e, re, enactment, it, is, the, patterns, of, expected, behavior, within, a, group, the, traditional, and, expected, way, of, doing, things, a, custom, can, be, a, single, gesture, such, as, thumbs, down, or, a, handshake, it, can, also, be, a, complex, interaction, of, multiple, folk, customs, and, artifacts, as, seen, in, a, child, s, birthday, party, including, verbal, lore, happy, birthday, song, material, lore, presents, and, a, birthday, cake, special, games, musical, chairs, and, individual, customs, making, a, wish, as, you, blow, out, the, candles, each, of, these, is, a, folklore, artifact, in, its, own, right, potentially, worthy, of, investigation, and, cultural, analysis, together, they, combine, to, build, the, custom, of, a, birthday, party, celebration, a, scripted, combination, of, multiple, artifacts, which, have, meaning, within, their, social, group, folklorists, divide, customs, into, several, different, categories, a, custom, can, be, a, seasonal, celebration, such, as, thanksgiving, or, new, year, s, it, can, be, a, life, cycle, celebration, for, an, individual, such, as, baptism, birthday, or, wedding, a, custom, can, also, mark, a, community, festival, or, event, examples, of, this, are, carnival, in, cologne, or, mardi, gras, in, new, orleans, this, category, also, includes, the, smithsonian, folklife, festival, celebrated, each, summer, on, the, mall, in, washington, dc, a, fourth, category, includes, customs, related, to, folk, beliefs, walking, under, a, ladder, is, just, one, of, many, symbols, considered, unlucky, occupational, groups, tend, to, have, a, rich, history, of, customs, related, to, their, life, and, work, so, the, traditions, of, sailors, or, lumberjacks, the, area, of, ecclesiastical, folklore, which, includes, modes, of, worship, not, sanctioned, by, the, established, church, tends, to, be, so, large, and, complex, that, it, is, usually, treated, as, a, specialized, area, of, folk, customs, it, requires, considerable, expertise, in, standard, church, ritual, in, order, to, adequately, interpret, folk, customs, and, beliefs, that, originated, in, official, church, practice, customary, folklore, is, always, a, performance, be, it, a, single, gesture, or, a, complex, of, scripted, customs, and, participating, in, the, custom, either, as, performer, or, audience, signifies, acknowledgment, of, that, social, group, some, customary, behavior, is, intended, to, be, performed, and, understood, only, within, the, group, itself, so, the, handkerchief, code, sometimes, used, in, the, gay, community, or, the, initiation, rituals, of, the, freemasons, other, customs, are, designed, specifically, to, represent, a, social, group, to, outsiders, those, who, do, not, belong, to, this, group, the, st, patrick, s, day, parade, in, new, york, and, in, other, communities, across, the, continent, is, a, single, example, of, an, ethnic, group, parading, their, separateness, differential, behavior, and, encouraging, americans, of, all, stripes, to, show, alliance, to, this, colorful, ethnic, group, these, festivals, and, parades, with, a, target, audience, of, people, who, do, not, belong, to, the, social, group, intersect, with, the, interests, and, mission, of, public, folklorists, who, are, engaged, in, the, documentation, preservation, and, presentation, of, traditional, forms, of, folklife, with, a, swell, in, popular, interest, in, folk, traditions, these, community, celebrations, are, becoming, more, numerous, throughout, the, western, world, while, ostensibly, parading, the, diversity, of, their, community, economic, groups, have, discovered, that, these, folk, parades, and, festivals, are, good, for, business, all, shades, of, people, are, out, on, the, streets, eating, drinking, and, spending, this, attracts, support, not, only, from, the, business, community, but, also, from, federal, and, state, organizations, for, these, local, street, parties, paradoxically, in, parading, diversity, within, the, community, these, events, have, come, to, authenticate, true, community, where, business, interests, ally, with, the, varied, folk, social, groups, to, promote, the, interests, of, the, community, as, a, whole, this, is, just, a, small, sampling, of, types, and, examples, of, customary, lore, childlore, is, a, distinct, branch, of, folklore, that, deals, with, activities, passed, on, by, children, to, other, children, away, from, the, influence, or, supervision, of, an, adult, children, s, folklore, contains, artifacts, from, all, the, standard, folklore, genres, of, verbal, material, and, customary, lore, it, is, however, the, child, to, child, conduit, that, distinguishes, these, artifacts, for, childhood, is, a, social, group, where, children, teach, learn, and, share, their, own, traditions, flourishing, in, a, street, culture, outside, the, purview, of, adults, this, is, also, ideal, where, it, needs, to, be, collected, as, iona, and, peter, opie, demonstrated, in, their, pioneering, book, children, s, games, in, street, and, playground, here, the, social, group, of, children, is, studied, on, its, own, terms, not, as, a, derivative, of, adult, social, groups, it, is, shown, that, the, culture, of, children, is, quite, distinctive, it, is, generally, unnoticed, by, the, sophisticated, world, of, adults, and, quite, as, little, affected, by, it, of, particular, interest, to, folklorists, here, is, the, mode, of, transmission, of, these, artifacts, this, lore, circulates, exclusively, within, an, informal, pre, literate, children, s, network, or, folk, group, it, does, not, include, artifacts, taught, to, children, by, adults, however, children, can, take, the, taught, and, teach, it, further, to, other, children, turning, it, into, childlore, or, they, can, take, the, artifacts, and, turn, them, into, something, else, so, old, mcdonald, s, farm, is, transformed, from, animal, noises, to, the, scatological, version, of, animal, poop, this, childlore, is, characterized, by, its, lack, of, dependence, on, literary, and, fixed, form, children, operate, among, themselves, in, a, world, of, informal, and, oral, communication, unimpeded, by, the, necessity, of, maintaining, and, transmitting, information, by, written, means, this, is, as, close, as, folklorists, can, come, to, observing, the, transmission, and, social, function, of, this, folk, knowledge, before, the, spread, of, literacy, during, the, 19th, century, as, we, have, seen, with, the, other, genres, the, original, collections, of, children, s, lore, and, games, in, the, 19th, century, was, driven, by, a, fear, that, the, culture, of, childhood, would, die, out, early, folklorists, among, them, alice, gomme, in, britain, and, william, wells, newell, in, the, united, states, felt, a, need, to, capture, the, unstructured, and, unsupervised, street, life, and, activities, of, children, before, it, was, lost, this, fear, proved, to, be, unfounded, in, a, comparison, of, any, modern, school, playground, during, recess, and, the, painting, of, children, s, games, by, pieter, breugel, the, elder, we, can, see, that, the, activity, level, is, similar, and, many, of, the, games, from, the, 1560, painting, are, recognizable, and, comparable, to, modern, variations, still, played, today, these, same, artifacts, of, childlore, in, innumerable, variations, also, continue, to, serve, the, same, function, of, learning, and, practicing, skills, needed, for, growth, so, bouncing, and, swinging, rhythms, and, rhymes, encourage, development, of, balance, and, coordination, in, infants, and, children, verbal, rhymes, like, peter, piper, picked, serve, to, increase, both, the, oral, and, aural, acuity, of, children, songs, and, chants, accessing, a, different, part, of, the, brain, are, used, to, memorize, series, alphabet, song, they, also, provide, the, necessary, beat, to, complex, physical, rhythms, and, movements, be, it, hand, clapping, jump, roping, or, ball, bouncing, furthermore, many, physical, games, are, used, to, develop, strength, coordination, and, endurance, of, the, players, for, some, team, games, negotiations, about, the, rules, can, run, on, longer, than, the, game, itself, as, social, skills, are, rehearsed, even, as, we, are, just, now, uncovering, the, neuroscience, that, undergirds, the, developmental, function, of, this, childlore, the, artifacts, themselves, have, been, in, play, for, centuries, below, is, listed, just, a, small, sampling, of, types, and, examples, of, childlore, and, games, a, case, has, been, made, for, considering, folk, history, as, a, distinct, sub, category, of, folklore, an, idea, that, has, received, attention, from, such, folklorists, as, richard, dorson, this, field, of, study, is, represented, in, the, folklore, historian, an, annual, journal, sponsored, by, the, history, and, folklore, section, of, the, american, folklore, society, and, concerned, with, the, connections, of, folklore, with, history, as, well, as, the, history, of, folklore, studies, lacking, context, folklore, artifacts, would, be, uninspiring, objects, without, any, life, of, their, own, it, is, only, through, performance, that, the, artifacts, come, alive, as, an, active, and, meaningful, component, of, a, social, group, the, intergroup, communication, arises, in, the, performance, and, this, is, where, transmission, of, these, cultural, elements, takes, place, american, folklorist, roger, d, abrahams, has, described, it, thus, folklore, is, folklore, only, when, performed, as, organized, entities, of, performance, items, of, folklore, have, a, sense, of, control, inherent, in, them, a, power, that, can, be, capitalized, upon, and, enhanced, through, effective, performance, without, transmission, these, items, are, not, folklore, they, are, just, individual, quirky, tales, and, objects, this, understanding, in, folkloristics, only, occurred, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, when, the, two, terms, folklore, performance, and, text, and, context, dominated, discussions, among, folklorists, these, terms, are, not, contradictory, or, even, mutually, exclusive, as, borrowings, from, other, fields, of, study, one, or, the, other, linguistic, formulation, is, more, appropriate, to, any, given, discussion, performance, is, frequently, tied, to, verbal, and, customary, lore, whereas, context, is, used, in, discussions, of, material, lore, both, formulations, offer, different, perspectives, on, the, same, folkloric, understanding, specifically, that, folklore, artifacts, need, to, remain, embedded, in, their, cultural, environment, if, we, are, to, gain, insight, into, their, meaning, for, the, community, the, concept, of, cultural, folklore, performance, is, shared, with, ethnography, and, anthropology, among, other, social, sciences, the, cultural, anthropologist, victor, turner, identified, four, universal, characteristics, of, cultural, performance, playfulness, framing, the, use, of, symbolic, language, and, employing, the, subjunctive, mood, in, viewing, the, performance, the, audience, leaves, the, daily, reality, to, move, into, a, mode, of, make, believe, or, what, if, it, is, self, evident, that, this, fits, well, with, all, types, of, verbal, lore, where, reality, has, no, place, among, the, symbols, fantasies, and, nonsense, of, traditional, tales, proverbs, and, jokes, customs, and, the, lore, of, children, and, games, also, fit, easily, into, the, language, of, a, folklore, performance, material, culture, requires, some, moulding, to, turn, it, into, a, performance, should, we, consider, the, performance, of, the, creation, of, the, artifact, as, in, a, quilting, party, or, the, performance, of, the, recipients, who, use, the, quilt, to, cover, their, marriage, bed, here, the, language, of, context, works, better, to, describe, the, quilting, of, patterns, copied, from, the, grandmother, quilting, as, a, social, event, during, the, winter, months, or, the, gifting, of, a, quilt, to, signify, the, importance, of, the, event, each, of, these, the, traditional, pattern, chosen, the, social, event, and, the, gifting, occur, within, the, broader, context, of, the, community, even, so, when, considering, context, the, structure, and, characteristics, of, performance, can, be, recognized, including, an, audience, a, framing, event, and, the, use, of, decorative, figures, and, symbols, all, of, which, go, beyond, the, utility, of, the, object, before, the, second, world, war, folk, artifacts, had, been, understood, and, collected, as, cultural, shards, of, an, earlier, time, they, were, considered, individual, vestigial, artifacts, with, little, or, no, function, in, the, contemporary, culture, given, this, understanding, the, goal, of, the, folklorist, was, to, capture, and, document, them, before, they, disappeared, they, were, collected, with, no, supporting, data, bound, in, books, archived, and, classified, more, or, less, successfully, the, historic, geographic, method, worked, to, isolate, and, track, these, collected, artifacts, mostly, verbal, lore, across, space, and, time, following, the, second, world, war, folklorists, began, to, articulate, a, more, holistic, approach, toward, their, subject, matter, in, tandem, with, the, growing, sophistication, in, the, social, sciences, attention, was, no, longer, limited, to, the, isolated, artifact, but, extended, to, include, the, artifact, embedded, in, an, active, cultural, environment, one, early, proponent, was, alan, dundes, with, his, essay, texture, text, and, context, first, published, 1964, a, public, presentation, in, 1967, by, dan, ben, amos, at, the, american, folklore, society, brought, the, behavioral, approach, into, open, debate, among, folklorists, in, 1972, richard, dorson, called, out, the, young, turks, for, their, movement, toward, a, behavioral, approach, to, folklore, this, approach, shifted, the, conceptualization, of, folklore, as, an, extractable, item, or, text, to, an, emphasis, on, folklore, as, a, kind, of, human, behavior, and, communication, conceptualizing, folklore, as, behavior, redefined, the, job, of, folklorists, folklore, became, a, verb, an, action, something, that, people, do, not, just, something, that, they, have, it, is, in, the, performance, and, the, active, context, that, folklore, artifacts, get, transmitted, in, informal, direct, communication, either, verbally, or, in, demonstration, performance, includes, all, the, different, modes, and, manners, in, which, this, transmission, occurs, transmission, is, a, communicative, process, requiring, a, binary, one, individual, or, group, who, actively, transmits, information, in, some, form, to, another, individual, or, group, each, of, these, is, a, defined, role, in, the, folklore, process, the, tradition, bearer, is, the, individual, who, actively, passes, along, the, knowledge, of, an, artifact, this, can, be, either, a, mother, singing, a, lullaby, to, her, baby, or, an, irish, dance, troupe, performing, at, a, local, festival, they, are, named, individuals, usually, well, known, in, the, community, as, knowledgeable, in, their, traditional, lore, they, are, not, the, anonymous, folk, the, nameless, mass, without, of, history, or, individuality, the, audience, of, this, performance, is, the, other, half, in, the, transmission, process, they, listen, watch, and, remember, few, of, them, will, become, active, tradition, bearers, many, more, will, be, passive, tradition, bearers, who, maintain, a, memory, of, this, specific, traditional, artifact, in, both, its, presentation, and, its, content, there, is, active, communication, between, the, audience, and, the, performer, the, performer, is, presenting, to, the, audience, the, audience, in, turn, through, its, actions, and, reactions, is, actively, communicating, with, the, performer, the, purpose, of, this, performance, is, not, to, create, something, new, but, to, re, create, something, that, already, exists, the, performance, is, words, and, actions, which, are, known, recognized, and, valued, by, both, the, performer, and, the, audience, for, folklore, is, first, and, foremost, remembered, behavior, as, members, of, the, same, cultural, reference, group, they, identify, and, value, this, performance, as, a, piece, of, shared, cultural, knowledge, to, initiate, the, performance, there, must, be, a, frame, of, some, sort, to, indicate, that, what, is, to, follow, is, indeed, performance, the, frame, brackets, it, as, outside, of, normal, discourse, in, customary, lore, such, as, life, cycle, celebrations, ex, birthday, or, dance, performances, the, framing, occurs, as, part, of, the, event, frequently, marked, by, location, the, audience, goes, to, the, event, location, to, participate, games, are, defined, primarily, by, rules, it, is, with, the, initiation, of, the, rules, that, the, game, is, framed, the, folklorist, barre, toelken, describes, an, evening, spent, in, a, navaho, family, playing, string, figure, games, with, each, of, the, members, shifting, from, performer, to, audience, as, they, create, and, display, different, figures, to, each, other, in, verbal, lore, the, performer, will, start, and, end, with, recognized, linguistic, formulas, an, easy, example, is, seen, in, the, common, introduction, to, a, joke, have, you, heard, the, one, joke, of, the, day, or, an, elephant, walks, into, a, bar, each, of, these, signals, to, the, listeners, that, the, following, is, a, joke, not, to, be, taken, literally, the, joke, is, completed, with, the, punch, line, of, the, joke, another, traditional, narrative, marker, in, english, is, the, framing, of, a, fairy, tale, between, the, phrases, once, upon, a, time, and, they, all, lived, happily, ever, after, many, languages, have, similar, phrases, which, are, used, to, frame, a, traditional, tale, each, of, these, linguistic, formulas, removes, the, bracketed, text, from, ordinary, discourse, and, marks, it, as, a, recognized, form, of, stylized, formulaic, communication, for, both, the, performer, and, the, audience, framing, as, a, narrative, device, serves, to, signal, to, both, the, story, teller, and, the, audience, that, the, narrative, which, follows, is, indeed, a, fiction, verbal, lore, and, not, to, be, understood, as, historical, fact, or, reality, it, moves, the, framed, narration, into, the, subjunctive, mood, and, marks, a, space, in, which, fiction, history, story, tradition, art, teaching, all, exist, within, the, narrated, or, performed, expressive, event, outside, the, normal, realms, and, constraints, of, reality, or, time, this, shift, from, the, realis, to, the, irrealis, mood, is, understood, by, all, participants, within, the, reference, group, it, enables, these, fictional, events, to, contain, meaning, for, the, group, and, can, lead, to, very, real, consequences, the, theory, of, self, correction, in, folklore, transmission, was, first, articulated, by, the, folklorist, walter, anderson, in, the, 1920s, this, posits, a, feedback, mechanism, which, would, keep, folklore, variants, closer, to, the, original, form, this, theory, addresses, the, question, about, how, with, multiple, performers, and, multiple, audiences, the, artifact, maintains, its, identity, across, time, and, geography, anderson, credited, the, audience, with, censoring, narrators, who, deviated, too, far, from, the, known, traditional, text, any, performance, is, a, two, way, communication, process, the, performer, addresses, the, audience, with, words, and, actions, the, audience, in, turn, actively, responds, to, the, performer, if, this, performance, deviates, too, far, from, audience, expectations, of, the, familiar, folk, artifact, they, will, respond, with, negative, feedback, wanting, to, avoid, more, negative, reaction, the, performer, will, adjust, his, performance, to, conform, to, audience, expectations, social, reward, by, an, audience, a, major, factor, in, motivating, narrators, it, is, this, dynamic, feedback, loop, between, performer, and, audience, which, gives, stability, to, the, text, of, the, performance, in, reality, this, model, is, not, so, simplistic, there, are, multiple, redundancies, in, the, active, folklore, process, the, performer, has, heard, the, tale, multiple, times, he, has, heard, it, from, different, story, tellers, in, multiple, versions, in, turn, he, tells, the, tale, multiple, times, to, the, same, or, a, different, audience, and, they, expect, to, hear, the, version, they, know, this, expanded, model, of, redundancy, in, a, non, linear, narrative, process, makes, it, difficult, to, innovate, during, any, single, performance, corrective, feedback, from, the, audience, will, be, immediate, at, the, heart, of, both, autopoetic, self, maintenance, and, the, virality, of, meme, transmission, it, is, enough, to, assume, that, some, sort, of, recursive, action, maintains, a, degree, of, integrity, in, certain, features, sufficient, to, allow, us, to, recognize, it, as, an, instance, of, its, type, for, material, folk, artifacts, it, becomes, more, fruitful, to, return, to, the, terminology, of, alan, dundes, text, and, context, here, the, text, designates, the, physical, artifact, itself, the, single, item, made, by, an, individual, for, a, specific, purpose, the, context, is, then, unmasked, by, observation, and, questions, concerning, both, its, production, and, its, usage, why, was, it, made, how, was, it, made, who, will, use, it, how, will, they, use, it, where, did, the, raw, materials, come, from, who, designed, it, etc, these, questions, are, limited, only, by, the, skill, of, the, interviewer, in, his, study, of, southeastern, kentucky, chair, makers, michael, owen, jones, describes, production, of, a, chair, within, the, context, of, the, life, of, the, craftsman, for, henry, glassie, in, his, study, of, folk, housing, in, middle, virginia, the, investigation, concerns, the, historical, pattern, he, finds, repeated, in, the, dwellings, of, this, region, the, house, is, planted, in, the, landscape, just, as, the, landscape, completes, itself, with, the, house, the, artisan, in, his, roadside, stand, or, shop, in, the, nearby, town, wants, to, make, and, display, products, which, appeal, to, customers, there, is, a, craftsperson, s, eagerness, to, produce, satisfactory, items, due, to, a, close, personal, contact, with, the, customer, and, expectations, to, serve, the, customer, again, here, the, role, of, consumer, is, the, basic, force, responsible, for, the, continuity, and, discontinuity, of, behavior, in, material, culture, the, context, becomes, the, cultural, environment, in, which, the, object, is, made, chair, used, house, and, sold, wares, none, of, these, artisans, is, anonymous, folk, they, are, individuals, making, a, living, with, the, tools, and, skills, learned, within, and, valued, in, the, context, of, their, community, no, two, performances, are, identical, the, performer, attempts, to, keep, the, performance, within, expectations, but, this, happens, despite, a, multitude, of, changing, variables, he, has, given, this, performance, one, time, more, or, less, the, audience, is, different, the, social, and, political, environment, has, changed, in, the, context, of, material, culture, no, two, hand, crafted, items, are, identical, sometimes, these, deviations, in, the, performance, and, the, production, are, unintentional, just, part, of, the, process, but, sometimes, these, deviations, are, intentional, the, performer, or, artisan, want, to, play, with, the, boundaries, of, expectation, and, add, their, own, creative, touch, they, perform, within, the, tension, of, conserving, the, recognized, form, and, adding, innovation, the, folklorist, barre, toelken, identifies, this, tension, as, a, combination, of, both, changing, dynamic, and, static, conservative, elements, that, evolve, and, change, through, sharing, communication, and, performance, over, time, the, cultural, context, shifts, and, morphs, new, leaders, new, technologies, new, values, new, awareness, as, the, context, changes, so, must, the, artifact, for, without, modifications, to, map, existing, artifacts, into, the, evolving, cultural, landscape, they, lose, their, meaning, joking, as, an, active, form, of, verbal, lore, makes, this, tension, visible, as, joke, cycles, come, and, go, to, reflect, new, issues, of, concern, once, an, artifact, is, no, longer, applicable, to, the, context, transmission, becomes, a, nonstarter, it, loses, relevancy, for, a, contemporary, audience, if, it, is, not, transmitted, then, it, is, no, longer, folklore, and, becomes, instead, an, historic, relic, folklorists, have, begun, to, identify, how, the, advent, of, electronic, communications, will, modify, and, change, the, performance, and, transmission, of, folklore, artifacts, it, is, clear, that, the, internet, is, modifying, folkloric, process, not, killing, it, as, despite, the, historic, association, between, folklore, and, anti, modernity, people, continue, to, use, traditional, expressive, forms, in, new, media, including, the, internet, jokes, and, joking, are, as, plentiful, as, ever, both, in, traditional, face, to, face, interactions, and, through, electronic, transmission, new, communication, modes, are, also, transforming, traditional, stories, into, many, different, configurations, the, fairy, tale, snow, white, is, now, offered, in, multiple, media, forms, for, both, children, and, adults, including, a, television, show, and, video, game
