two, sons, of, jacob, and, rachel, jacob, s, twelfth, named, child, and, eleventh, son, he, is, the, founder, of, the, tribe, of, joseph, among, the, israelites, his, story, functions, as, an, explanation, for, israel, s, residence, in, egypt, he, is, the, favourite, son, of, the, patriarch, jacob, and, his, jealous, brothers, sell, him, into, slavery, in, biblical, egypt, where, he, eventually, ends, up, incarcerated, after, correctly, interpreting, the, dreams, of, pharaoh, however, he, rises, to, second, in, command, in, egypt, and, saves, egypt, during, a, famine, jacob, s, family, travels, to, egypt, to, escape, the, famine, and, it, is, through, him, that, they, are, given, leave, to, settle, in, the, land, of, goshen, the, eastern, part, of, the, nile, delta, scholars, hold, different, opinions, about, the, historical, background, of, the, joseph, story, as, well, as, the, date, and, development, of, its, composition, some, scholars, argue, that, the, narrative, was, a, multigenerational, work, with, both, early, and, late, old, and, new, components, that, was, produced, over, a, long, time, and, in, a, complex, way, extending, from, the, monarchic, into, the, postmonarchic, period, of, ancient, israel, in, jewish, tradition, he, is, the, ancestor, of, a, second, messiah, called, mashiach, ben, yosef, who, will, wage, war, against, the, forces, of, evil, alongside, mashiach, ben, david, and, die, in, combat, with, the, enemies, of, god, and, israel, the, bible, offers, two, explanations, of, the, name, yos, f, first, it, is, compared, to, the, triliteral, s, p, meaning, to, gather, remove, take, away, and, she, conceived, and, bore, a, son, and, said, god, hath, taken, away, my, reproach, genesis, 30, 23, yos, f, is, then, identified, with, the, similar, root, y, s, p, meaning, to, add, and, she, called, his, name, joseph, and, said, the, lord, shall, add, to, me, another, son, genesis, 30, 24, joseph, son, of, jacob, and, rachel, lived, in, the, land, of, canaan, with, ten, half, brothers, one, full, brother, and, at, least, one, half, sister, he, was, rachel, s, firstborn, and, jacob, s, eleventh, son, of, all, the, sons, joseph, was, preferred, by, his, father, who, gave, him, a, long, coat, of, many, colors, when, joseph, was, seventeen, years, old, he, shared, with, his, brothers, two, dreams, he, had, in, the, first, dream, joseph, and, his, brothers, gathered, bundles, of, grain, of, which, those, his, brothers, gathered, bowed, to, his, own, in, the, second, dream, the, sun, father, the, moon, mother, and, eleven, stars, brothers, bowed, to, joseph, himself, these, dreams, implying, his, supremacy, angered, his, brothers, genesis, 37, 1, 11, and, made, the, brothers, plot, his, demise, in, genesis, 37, vayeshev, joseph, s, half, brothers, were, jealous, of, him, most, of, them, plotted, to, kill, him, in, dothan, except, reuben, who, suggested, they, throw, joseph, into, an, empty, cistern, he, intended, to, rescue, joseph, himself, later, unaware, of, this, plan, to, rescue, joseph, the, others, agreed, with, reuben, upon, imprisoning, joseph, the, brothers, saw, a, camel, caravan, carrying, spices, and, perfumes, to, egypt, and, sold, joseph, to, these, merchants, the, guilty, brothers, painted, goat, s, blood, on, joseph, s, coat, and, showed, it, to, jacob, who, therefore, believed, joseph, had, died, in, genesis, 39, vayeshev, joseph, was, sold, to, potiphar, the, captain, of, pharaoh, s, guard, later, joseph, became, potiphar, s, servant, and, subsequently, his, household, s, superintendent, here, potiphar, s, wife, later, called, zulaykha, tried, to, seduce, joseph, which, he, refused, angered, by, his, running, away, from, her, she, made, a, false, accusation, of, rape, so, he, would, be, imprisoned, the, warden, put, joseph, in, charge, of, the, other, prisoners, and, soon, afterward, pharaoh, s, chief, cup, bearer, and, chief, baker, who, had, offended, the, pharaoh, were, thrown, into, the, prison, both, men, had, dreams, and, joseph, being, able, to, interpret, dreams, asked, to, hear, them, the, cup, bearer, s, dream, was, about, a, vine, with, three, branches, that, was, budding, and, as, it, was, budding, its, blossoms, came, out, and, they, produced, grapes, the, cup, bearer, took, those, grapes, and, squeezed, them, into, pharaoh, s, cup, and, placed, the, cup, in, pharaoh, s, hand, joseph, interpreted, this, dream, as, the, cup, bearer, being, restored, as, cup, bearer, to, the, pharaoh, within, three, days, the, baker, s, dream, was, about, three, baskets, full, of, bread, for, the, pharaoh, and, birds, were, eating, the, bread, out, of, those, baskets, joseph, interpreted, this, dream, as, the, baker, being, hanged, within, three, days, and, having, his, flesh, eaten, by, birds, joseph, requested, that, the, cup, bearer, mention, him, to, pharaoh, to, secure, his, release, from, prison, but, the, cup, bearer, reinstalled, in, office, forgot, joseph, after, two, more, years, the, pharaoh, dreamt, of, seven, lean, cows, which, devoured, seven, fat, cows, and, of, seven, withered, ears, of, grain, which, devoured, seven, fat, ears, when, the, pharaoh, s, advisers, failed, to, interpret, these, dreams, the, cup, bearer, remembered, joseph, joseph, was, then, summoned, he, interpreted, the, dream, as, seven, years, of, abundance, followed, by, seven, years, of, famine, and, advised, the, pharaoh, to, store, surplus, grain, following, the, prediction, joseph, became, vizier, under, the, name, of, zaphnath, paaneah, hebrew, p, na, pa, n, a, and, was, given, asenath, the, daughter, of, potipherah, priest, of, on, to, be, his, wife, during, the, seven, years, of, abundance, joseph, ensured, that, the, storehouses, were, full, and, that, all, produce, was, weighed, in, the, sixth, year, asenath, bore, two, children, to, joseph, manasseh, and, ephraim, when, the, famine, came, it, was, so, severe, that, people, from, surrounding, nations, came, to, egypt, to, buy, bread, the, narrative, also, indicates, that, they, went, straight, to, joseph, or, were, directed, to, him, even, by, the, pharaoh, himself, genesis, 41, 37, 57, as, a, last, resort, all, of, the, inhabitants, of, egypt, less, the, egyptian, priestly, class, sold, their, properties, and, later, themselves, as, slaves, to, joseph, for, seed, wherefore, joseph, set, a, mandate, that, because, the, people, would, be, sowing, and, harvesting, seed, on, government, property, a, fifth, of, the, produce, should, go, to, the, pharaoh, this, mandate, lasted, until, the, days, of, moses, genesis, 47, 20, 31, in, the, second, year, of, famine, joseph, s, half, brothers, were, sent, to, egypt, to, buy, goods, when, they, came, to, egypt, they, stood, before, the, vizier, but, did, not, recognize, him, as, their, brother, joseph, who, was, now, in, his, late, 30s, but, joseph, did, recognize, them, and, did, not, speak, at, all, to, them, in, his, native, tongue, of, hebrew, after, questioning, them, he, accused, them, of, being, spies, after, they, mentioned, a, younger, brother, at, home, the, vizier, joseph, demanded, that, he, be, brought, to, egypt, as, a, demonstration, of, their, veracity, this, was, joseph, s, full, brother, benjamin, joseph, placed, his, brothers, in, prison, for, three, days, on, the, third, day, he, brought, them, out, of, prison, to, reiterate, that, he, wanted, their, youngest, brother, brought, to, egypt, to, demonstrate, their, veracity, the, brothers, conferred, amongst, themselves, speaking, in, hebrew, reflecting, on, the, wrong, they, had, done, to, joseph, joseph, understood, what, they, were, saying, and, removed, himself, from, their, presence, because, he, was, caught, in, emotion, when, he, returned, the, vizier, took, simeon, and, bound, him, as, a, hostage, then, he, had, their, donkeys, prepared, with, grain, and, sent, the, other, brothers, back, to, canaan, unbeknownst, to, them, joseph, had, also, returned, their, money, to, their, money, sacks, genesis, 42, 1, 28, the, remaining, brothers, returned, to, their, father, in, canaan, and, told, him, all, that, had, transpired, in, egypt, they, also, discovered, that, all, of, their, money, sacks, still, had, money, in, them, and, they, were, dismayed, then, they, informed, their, father, that, the, vizier, demanded, that, benjamin, be, brought, before, him, to, demonstrate, that, they, were, honest, men, jacob, became, greatly, distressed, feeling, deprived, of, successive, sons, joseph, simeon, and, prospectively, benjamin, after, they, had, consumed, all, of, the, grain, that, they, brought, back, from, egypt, jacob, told, his, sons, to, go, back, to, egypt, for, more, grain, with, reuben, and, judah, s, persistence, they, persuaded, their, father, to, let, benjamin, join, them, for, fear, of, egyptian, retribution, genesis, 42, 29, 43, 15, upon, their, return, to, egypt, the, steward, of, joseph, s, house, received, the, brothers, when, they, were, brought, to, joseph, s, house, they, were, apprehensive, about, the, returned, money, in, their, money, sacks, they, thought, that, the, missed, transaction, would, somehow, be, used, against, them, as, way, to, induct, them, as, slaves, and, to, confiscate, their, possessions, so, they, immediately, informed, the, steward, of, what, had, transpired, the, steward, put, them, at, ease, telling, them, not, to, worry, about, the, money, and, brought, out, their, brother, simeon, then, he, brought, the, brothers, into, the, house, of, joseph, and, received, them, hospitably, when, the, vizier, joseph, appeared, they, gave, him, gifts, from, their, father, joseph, saw, and, inquired, of, benjamin, and, was, overcome, by, emotion, but, did, not, show, it, he, withdrew, to, his, chambers, and, wept, when, he, regained, control, of, himself, he, returned, and, ordered, a, meal, to, be, served, the, egyptians, would, not, dine, with, hebrews, at, the, same, table, as, doing, so, was, considered, loathsome, thus, the, sons, of, israel, were, served, at, a, separate, table, genesis, 43, 16, 44, 34, that, night, joseph, ordered, his, steward, to, load, the, brothers, donkeys, with, food, and, all, their, money, the, money, they, had, brought, was, double, what, they, had, offered, on, the, first, trip, deceptively, joseph, also, ordered, the, steward, to, put, his, silver, cup, in, benjamin, s, sack, the, following, morning, the, brothers, began, their, journey, back, to, canaan, joseph, ordered, the, steward, to, go, after, the, brothers, and, to, question, them, about, the, missing, silver, cup, when, the, steward, caught, up, with, the, brothers, he, seized, them, and, searched, their, sacks, the, steward, found, the, cup, in, benjamin, s, sack, just, as, he, had, planted, it, the, night, before, this, caused, a, stir, amongst, the, brothers, however, they, agreed, to, be, escorted, back, to, egypt, when, the, vizier, joseph, confronted, them, about, the, silver, cup, he, demanded, that, the, one, who, possessed, the, cup, in, his, bag, become, his, slave, in, response, judah, pleaded, with, the, vizier, that, benjamin, be, allowed, to, return, to, his, father, and, that, he, himself, be, kept, in, benjamin, s, place, as, a, slave, genesis, 44, judah, appealed, to, the, vizier, begging, that, benjamin, be, released, and, that, he, be, enslaved, in, his, stead, because, of, the, silver, cup, found, in, benjamin, s, sack, the, vizier, broke, down, into, tears, he, could, not, control, himself, any, longer, and, so, he, sent, the, egyptian, men, out, of, the, house, then, he, revealed, to, the, hebrews, that, he, was, in, fact, their, brother, joseph, he, wept, so, loudly, that, even, the, egyptian, household, heard, it, outside, the, brothers, were, frozen, and, could, not, utter, a, word, he, brought, them, closer, and, relayed, to, them, the, events, that, had, happened, and, told, them, not, to, fear, that, what, they, had, meant, for, evil, god, had, meant, for, good, then, he, commanded, them, to, go, and, bring, their, father, and, his, entire, household, into, egypt, to, live, in, the, province, of, goshen, because, there, were, five, more, years, of, famine, left, so, joseph, supplied, them, egyptian, transport, wagons, new, garments, silver, money, and, twenty, additional, donkeys, carrying, provisions, for, the, journey, genesis, 45, 1, 28, thus, jacob, also, known, as, israel, and, his, entire, house, of, seventy, gathered, up, with, all, their, livestock, and, began, their, journey, to, egypt, as, they, approached, egyptian, territory, judah, went, ahead, to, ask, joseph, where, the, caravan, should, unload, they, were, directed, into, the, province, of, goshen, and, joseph, readied, his, chariot, to, meet, his, father, there, it, had, been, over, twenty, years, since, joseph, had, last, seen, his, father, when, they, met, they, embraced, each, other, and, wept, together, for, quite, a, while, his, father, then, remarked, now, let, me, die, since, i, have, seen, your, face, because, you, are, still, alive, genesis, 46, 1, 34, afterward, joseph, s, family, personally, met, the, pharaoh, of, egypt, the, pharaoh, honored, their, stay, and, even, proposed, that, if, there, were, any, qualified, men, in, their, house, then, they, may, elect, a, chief, herdsman, to, oversee, egyptian, livestock, because, the, pharaoh, had, such, a, high, regard, for, joseph, practically, making, him, his, equal, it, had, been, an, honor, to, meet, his, father, thus, israel, was, able, to, bless, the, pharaoh, genesis, 47, 1, 47, 12, the, family, was, then, settled, in, goshen, the, house, of, israel, acquired, many, possessions, and, multiplied, exceedingly, during, the, course, of, seventeen, years, even, through, the, worst, of, the, seven, year, famine, at, this, time, joseph, s, father, was, 147, years, old, and, bedridden, he, had, fallen, ill, and, lost, most, of, his, vision, joseph, was, called, into, his, father, s, house, and, israel, pleaded, with, his, son, that, he, not, be, buried, in, egypt, rather, he, requested, to, be, carried, to, the, land, of, canaan, to, be, buried, with, his, forefathers, joseph, was, sworn, to, do, as, his, father, asked, of, him, genesis, 47, 27, 31, later, joseph, came, to, visit, his, father, having, with, him, his, two, sons, ephraim, and, manasseh, israel, declared, that, they, would, be, heirs, to, the, inheritance, of, the, house, of, israel, as, if, they, were, his, own, children, just, as, reuben, and, simeon, were, then, israel, laid, his, left, hand, on, the, eldest, mannasseh, s, head, and, his, right, hand, on, the, youngest, ephraim, s, head, and, blessed, joseph, however, joseph, was, displeased, that, his, father, s, right, hand, was, not, on, the, head, of, his, firstborn, so, he, switched, his, father, s, hands, but, israel, refused, saying, but, truly, his, younger, brother, shall, be, greater, than, he, a, declaration, he, made, just, as, israel, himself, was, to, his, firstborn, brother, esau, to, joseph, he, gave, a, portion, more, of, canaanite, property, than, he, had, to, his, other, sons, land, that, he, fought, for, against, the, amorites, genesis, 48, 1, 22, then, israel, called, all, of, his, sons, in, and, prophesied, their, blessings, or, curses, to, all, twelve, of, them, in, order, of, their, ages, to, joseph, he, declared, joseph, is, a, fruitful, bough, even, a, fruitful, bough, by, a, well, whose, branches, run, over, the, wall, the, archers, have, sorely, grieved, him, and, shot, at, him, and, hated, him, but, his, bow, abode, in, strength, and, the, arms, of, his, hands, were, made, strong, by, the, hands, of, the, mighty, god, of, jacob, from, thence, is, the, shepherd, the, stone, of, israel, even, by, the, god, of, your, father, who, shall, help, thee, and, by, the, almighty, who, shall, bless, thee, with, blessings, of, heaven, above, blessings, of, the, deep, that, lieth, under, blessings, of, the, breasts, and, of, the, womb, the, blessings, of, thy, father, have, prevailed, above, the, blessings, of, my, progenitors, unto, the, utmost, bound, of, the, everlasting, hills, they, shall, be, on, the, head, of, joseph, and, on, the, crown, of, the, head, of, him, that, was, separate, from, his, brethren, after, relaying, his, prophecies, israel, died, the, family, including, the, egyptians, mourned, him, seventy, days, joseph, had, his, father, embalmed, a, process, that, took, forty, days, then, he, prepared, a, great, ceremonial, journey, to, canaan, leading, the, servants, of, the, pharaoh, and, the, elders, of, the, houses, israel, and, egypt, beyond, the, jordan, river, they, stopped, at, atad, where, they, observed, seven, days, of, mourning, here, their, lamentation, was, so, great, that, it, caught, the, attention, of, surrounding, canaanites, who, remarked, this, is, a, deep, mourning, of, the, egyptians, so, they, named, this, spot, abel, mizraim, then, joseph, buried, israel, in, the, cave, of, machpelah, the, property, of, abraham, when, he, bought, it, from, the, hittites, genesis, 49, 33, 50, 14, after, their, father, died, the, brothers, of, joseph, feared, retribution, for, being, responsible, for, joseph, s, deliverance, into, egypt, as, a, slave, joseph, wept, as, they, spoke, and, told, them, that, what, had, happened, was, god, s, purpose, to, save, lives, and, the, lives, of, his, family, he, comforted, them, and, their, ties, were, reconciled, genesis, 50, 15, 21, joseph, lived, to, the, age, of, 110, living, to, see, his, great, grandchildren, before, he, died, he, made, the, children, of, israel, swear, that, when, they, left, the, land, of, egypt, they, would, take, his, bones, with, them, and, on, his, death, his, body, was, embalmed, and, placed, in, a, coffin, in, egypt, genesis, 50, 22, 26, the, children, of, israel, remembered, their, oath, and, when, they, left, egypt, during, the, exodus, moses, took, joseph, s, bones, with, him, exodus, 13, 19, the, bones, were, buried, at, shechem, in, the, parcel, of, ground, which, jacob, bought, from, the, sons, of, hamor, joshua, 24, 32, which, has, traditionally, been, identified, with, site, of, joseph, s, tomb, before, jacob, and, all, his, family, moved, to, egypt, shechem, was, in, the, land, which, was, allocated, by, joshua, to, the, tribe, of, ephraim, one, of, the, tribes, of, the, house, of, joseph, after, the, conquest, of, canaan, in, 1970, donald, b, redford, argued, that, the, composition, of, the, story, could, be, dated, to, the, period, between, the, 7th, century, bce, and, the, third, quarter, of, the, 5th, century, bce, by, the, early, 1990s, a, majority, of, modern, scholars, agreed, that, the, joseph, story, was, a, wisdom, novella, constructed, by, a, single, author, and, that, it, reached, its, current, form, in, the, 5th, century, bce, at, the, earliest, with, soggin, suggesting, the, possibility, of, a, first, or, early, second, century, bce, date, some, scholars, argue, that, the, core, of, the, story, could, be, traced, back, to, a, 2nd, millennium, bce, context, thomas, r, mer, argues, that, the, date, of, the, original, narrative, can, be, the, late, persian, period, and, while, there, are, several, passages, that, fit, better, into, a, greek, ptolemaic, context, most, of, these, passages, belong, to, later, revisions, the, motif, of, dreams, dream, interpretation, contributes, to, a, strong, story, like, narrative, the, plot, begins, by, showing, joseph, as, a, dreamer, this, leads, him, into, trouble, as, out, of, jealousy, his, brothers, sell, him, into, slavery, the, next, two, instances, of, dream, interpretation, establish, his, reputation, as, a, great, interpreter, of, dreams, first, he, begins, in, a, low, place, interpreting, the, dreams, of, prisoners, then, joseph, is, summoned, to, interpret, the, dreams, of, pharaoh, himself, impressed, with, joseph, s, interpretations, pharaoh, appoints, him, as, second, in, command, gen, 41, 41, this, sets, up, the, climax, of, the, story, which, many, regard, to, be, the, moment, joseph, reveals, his, identity, to, his, brothers, gen, 45, 3, in, the, midrash, the, selling, of, joseph, was, part, of, god, s, divine, plan, for, him, to, save, his, tribes, the, favoritism, israel, showed, joseph, and, the, plot, against, him, by, his, brothers, were, divine, means, of, getting, him, into, egypt, maimonides, comments, that, even, the, villager, in, shechem, about, whom, joseph, inquired, his, brother, s, whereabouts, was, a, divine, messenger, working, behind, the, scene, a, midrash, asked, how, many, times, was, joseph, sold, in, analyzing, genesis, chapter, 37, there, are, five, different, hebrew, names, used, to, describe, five, different, groups, of, people, involved, in, the, transaction, of, selling, joseph, according, to, rabbi, judah, and, rav, huna, the, first, group, identified, are, joseph, s, brothers, when, judah, brings, up, the, idea, of, selling, joseph, in, verses, 26, and, 27, the, first, mention, of, ishmaelites, yishma, el, m, is, in, verse, 25, then, the, hebrew, phrase, sh, m, midyan, m, s, r, m, in, verse, 28, describes, midianite, traders, a, fourth, group, in, verse, 36, is, named, in, hebrew, as, m, dan, m, that, is, properly, identified, as, medanites, the, final, group, where, a, transaction, is, made, is, among, the, egyptians, in, the, same, verse, after, identifying, the, hebrew, names, rabbi, judah, claims, that, joseph, was, sold, four, times, first, his, brothers, sold, joseph, to, the, ishmaelites, yishma, el, m, then, the, ishmaelites, sold, him, to, the, midianite, traders, sh, m, midyan, m, s, r, m, the, midianite, traders, to, the, medanites, m, dan, m, and, the, medanites, into, egypt, rav, huna, adds, one, more, sale, by, concluding, that, after, the, medanites, sold, him, to, the, egyptians, a, fifth, sale, occurred, when, the, egyptians, sold, him, to, potiphar, genesis, rabbah, 84, 22, joseph, had, good, reasons, not, to, have, an, affair, with, potiphar, s, wife, he, did, not, want, to, abuse, his, master, s, trust, he, believed, in, the, sanctity, of, marriage, and, it, went, against, his, ethical, moral, and, religious, principles, taught, to, him, by, his, father, jacob, according, to, the, midrash, joseph, would, have, been, immediately, executed, by, the, sexual, assault, charge, against, him, by, potiphar, s, wife, abravanel, explains, that, she, had, accused, other, servants, of, the, same, crime, in, the, past, potiphar, believed, that, joseph, was, incapable, of, such, an, act, and, petitioned, pharaoh, to, spare, his, life, however, punishment, could, not, have, been, avoided, because, of, her, class, status, and, limited, public, knowledge, of, her, scheme, according, to, legends, of, the, jews, the, name, of, potiphar, s, wife, is, zuleikha, and, when, she, was, enticing, joseph, to, give, up, to, her, sinful, passion, god, appeared, unto, him, holding, the, foundation, of, earth, eben, shetiyah, that, he, would, destroy, the, world, if, joseph, touched, her, jewish, tradition, holds, that, joseph, had, his, steward, plant, his, personal, silver, cup, in, benjamin, s, sack, to, test, his, brothers, he, wanted, to, know, if, they, would, be, willing, to, risk, danger, in, order, to, save, their, half, brother, benjamin, since, joseph, and, benjamin, were, born, from, rachel, this, test, was, necessary, to, reveal, if, they, would, betray, benjamin, as, they, did, with, joseph, when, he, was, seventeen, because, joseph, the, dreamer, predicts, the, future, by, analyzing, dreams, alternative, jewish, tradition, claims, that, he, practiced, divination, using, this, silver, cup, as, the,
