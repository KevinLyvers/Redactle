freethought, sometimes, spelled, free, thought, is, an, unorthodox, attitude, or, belief, a, freethinker, holds, that, beliefs, should, not, be, formed, on, the, basis, of, authority, tradition, revelation, or, dogma, and, should, instead, be, reached, by, other, methods, such, as, logic, reason, and, empirical, observation, according, to, the, collins, english, dictionary, a, freethinker, is, one, who, is, mentally, free, from, the, conventional, bonds, of, tradition, or, dogma, and, thinks, independently, in, some, contemporary, thought, in, particular, free, thought, is, strongly, tied, with, rejection, of, traditional, social, or, religious, belief, systems, the, cognitive, application, of, free, thought, is, known, as, freethinking, and, practitioners, of, free, thought, are, known, as, freethinkers, modern, freethinkers, consider, free, thought, to, be, a, natural, freedom, from, all, negative, and, illusive, thoughts, acquired, from, society, the, term, first, came, into, use, in, the, 17th, century, in, order, to, refer, to, people, who, inquired, into, the, basis, of, traditional, beliefs, which, were, often, accepted, unquestioningly, today, freethinking, is, most, closely, linked, with, agnosticism, deism, secularism, humanism, anti, clericalism, and, religious, critique, the, oxford, english, dictionary, defines, freethinking, as, the, free, exercise, of, reason, in, matters, of, religious, belief, unrestrained, by, deference, to, authority, the, adoption, of, the, principles, of, a, free, thinker, freethinkers, hold, that, knowledge, should, be, grounded, in, facts, scientific, inquiry, and, logic, the, skeptical, application, of, science, implies, freedom, from, the, intellectually, limiting, effects, of, confirmation, bias, cognitive, bias, conventional, wisdom, popular, culture, urban, myth, prejudice, or, sectarianism, atheist, author, adam, lee, defines, free, thought, as, thinking, which, is, independent, of, revelation, tradition, established, belief, and, authority, and, considers, it, as, a, broader, umbrella, than, atheism, that, embraces, a, rainbow, of, unorthodoxy, religious, dissent, skepticism, and, unconventional, thinking, the, basic, summarizing, statement, of, the, essay, the, ethics, of, belief, by, the, 19th, century, british, mathematician, and, philosopher, william, kingdon, clifford, is, it, is, wrong, always, everywhere, and, for, anyone, to, believe, anything, upon, insufficient, evidence, the, essay, became, a, rallying, cry, for, freethinkers, when, published, in, the, 1870s, and, has, been, described, as, a, point, when, freethinkers, grabbed, the, moral, high, ground, clifford, was, himself, an, organizer, of, free, thought, gatherings, the, driving, force, behind, the, congress, of, liberal, thinkers, held, in, 1878, regarding, religion, freethinkers, typically, hold, that, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, support, the, existence, of, supernatural, phenomena, according, to, the, freedom, from, religion, foundation, no, one, can, be, a, freethinker, who, demands, conformity, to, a, bible, creed, or, messiah, to, the, freethinker, revelation, and, faith, are, invalid, and, orthodoxy, is, no, guarantee, of, truth, and, freethinkers, are, convinced, that, religious, claims, have, not, withstood, the, tests, of, reason, not, only, is, there, nothing, to, be, gained, by, believing, an, untruth, but, there, is, everything, to, lose, when, we, sacrifice, the, indispensable, tool, of, reason, on, the, altar, of, superstition, most, freethinkers, consider, religion, to, be, not, only, untrue, but, harmful, however, philosopher, bertrand, russell, wrote, the, following, in, his, 1944, essay, the, value, of, free, thought, what, makes, a, freethinker, is, not, his, beliefs, but, the, way, in, which, he, holds, them, if, he, holds, them, because, his, elders, told, him, they, were, true, when, he, was, young, or, if, he, holds, them, because, if, he, did, not, he, would, be, unhappy, his, thought, is, not, free, but, if, he, holds, them, because, after, careful, thought, he, finds, a, balance, of, evidence, in, their, favour, then, his, thought, is, free, however, odd, his, conclusions, may, seem, a, freethinker, according, to, russell, is, not, necessarily, an, atheist, or, an, agnostic, as, long, as, he, or, she, satisfies, this, definition, the, person, who, is, free, in, any, respect, is, free, from, something, what, is, the, free, thinker, free, from, to, be, worthy, of, the, name, he, must, be, free, of, two, things, the, force, of, tradition, and, the, tyranny, of, his, own, passions, no, one, is, completely, free, from, either, but, in, the, measure, of, a, man, s, emancipation, he, deserves, to, be, called, a, free, thinker, fred, edwords, former, executive, of, the, american, humanist, association, suggests, that, by, russell, s, definition, liberal, religionists, who, have, challenged, established, orthodoxies, can, be, considered, freethinkers, on, the, other, hand, according, to, bertrand, russell, atheists, and, or, agnostics, are, not, necessarily, freethinkers, as, an, example, he, mentions, stalin, whom, he, compares, to, a, pope, what, i, am, concerned, with, is, the, doctrine, of, the, modern, communistic, party, and, of, the, russian, government, to, which, it, owes, allegiance, according, to, this, doctrine, the, world, develops, on, the, lines, of, a, plan, called, dialectical, materialism, first, discovered, by, karl, marx, embodied, in, the, practice, of, a, great, state, by, lenin, and, now, expounded, from, day, to, day, by, a, church, of, which, stalin, is, the, pope, free, discussion, is, to, be, prevented, wherever, the, power, to, do, so, exists, if, this, doctrine, and, this, organization, prevail, free, inquiry, will, become, as, impossible, as, it, was, in, the, middle, ages, and, the, world, will, relapse, into, bigotry, and, obscurantism, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, many, thinkers, regarded, as, freethinkers, were, deists, arguing, that, the, nature, of, god, can, only, be, known, from, a, study, of, nature, rather, than, from, religious, revelation, in, the, 18th, century, deism, was, as, much, of, a, dirty, word, as, atheism, and, deists, were, often, stigmatized, as, either, atheists, or, at, least, as, freethinkers, by, their, christian, opponents, deists, today, regard, themselves, as, freethinkers, but, are, now, arguably, less, prominent, in, the, free, thought, movement, than, atheists, among, freethinkers, for, a, notion, to, be, considered, true, it, must, be, testable, verifiable, and, logical, many, freethinkers, tend, to, be, humanists, who, base, morality, on, human, needs, and, would, find, meaning, in, human, compassion, social, progress, art, personal, happiness, love, and, the, furtherance, of, knowledge, generally, freethinkers, like, to, think, for, themselves, tend, to, be, skeptical, respect, critical, thinking, and, reason, remain, open, to, new, concepts, and, are, sometimes, proud, of, their, own, individuality, they, would, determine, truth, for, themselves, based, upon, knowledge, they, gain, answers, they, receive, experiences, they, have, and, the, balance, they, thus, acquire, freethinkers, reject, conformity, for, the, sake, of, conformity, whereby, they, create, their, own, beliefs, by, considering, the, way, the, world, around, them, works, and, would, possess, the, intellectual, integrity, and, courage, to, think, outside, of, accepted, norms, which, may, or, may, not, lead, them, to, believe, in, some, higher, power, the, pansy, serves, as, the, long, established, and, enduring, symbol, of, free, thought, literature, of, the, american, secular, union,

derives, its, name, from, the, french, word, pens, e, which, means, thought, it, allegedly, received, this, name, because, the, flower, is, perceived, by, some, to, bear, resemblance, to, a, human, face, and, in, mid, to, late, summer, it, nods, forward, as, if, deep, in, thought, in, the, 1880s, following, examples, set, by, freethinkers, in, france, belgium, spain, and, sweden, it, was,

1877, and, again, in, 1881, when, it, was, renamed, the, toronto, secular, society, the, group, formed, the, nucleus, of, the, canadian, secular, union, established, in, 1884, to, bring, together, freethinkers, from, across, the, country, a, significant, number, of, the, early, members, appear, to, have, come, from, the, educated, labour, aristocracy, including, alfred, f, jury, j, ick, evans,

make, access, to, abortion, free, and, legal, in, canada, in, france, the, concept, first, appeared, in, publication, in, 1765, when, denis, diderot, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, and, voltaire,

lack, of, effective, leadership, freethought, in, the, united, states, declined, in, the, early, twentieth, century, by, the, early, twentieth, century, most, freethought, congregations, had, disbanded, or, joined, other, mainstream, churches, the, longest, continuously, operating, freethought, congregation, in, america, is, the, free, congregation, of, sauk, county, wisconsin, which, was, founded, in, 1852, and, is, still, active, as, of, 2020, it, affiliated, with, the, american, unitarian, association, now, the, unitarian, universalist, association, in, 1955, d, m, bennett, was, the, founder, and, publisher, of, the, truth, seeker, in, 1873, a, radical, free, thought, and, reform, american, periodical, german, freethinker, settlements, were, located, in, freethought, influenced, the, development, of, anarchism, in, the, united, states, in, the, u, s, free, thought, was, a, basically, anti, christian, anti, clerical, movement, whose, purpose, was, to, make, the, individual, politically, and, spiritually, free, to, decide, for, himself, on, religious, matters, a, number, of, contributors, to, liberty, were, prominent, figures, in, both, free, thought, and, anarchism, the, american, individualist, anarchist, george, macdonald, was, a, co, editor, of, freethought, and, for, a, time, the, truth, seeker, e, c, walker, was, co, editor, of, the, freethought, free, love, journal, lucifer, the, light, bearer, many, of, the, anarchists, were, ardent, freethinkers, reprints, from, free, thought, papers, such, as, lucifer, the, light, bearer, freethought, and, the, truth, seeker, appeared, in, liberty, the, church, was, viewed, as, a, common, ally, of, the, state, and, as, a, repressive, force, in, and, of, itself, in, europe, a, similar, development, occurred, in, french, and, spanish, individualist, anarchist, circles, anticlericalism, just, as, in, the, rest, of, the, libertarian, movement, in, another, of, the, frequent, elements, which, will, gain, relevance, related, to, the, measure, in, which, the, french, republic, begins, to, have, conflicts, with, the, church, anti, clerical, discourse, frequently, called, for, by, the, french, individualist, andr, lorulot, will, have, its, impacts, in, estudios, a, spanish, individualist, anarchist, publication, there, will, be, an, attack, on, institutionalized, religion, for, the, responsibility, that, it, had, in, the, past, on, negative, developments, for, its, irrationality, which, makes, it, a, counterpoint, of, philosophical, and, scientific, progress, there, will, be, a, criticism, of, proselytism, and, ideological, manipulation, which, happens, on, both, believers, and, agnostics, these, tendencies, would, continue, in, french, individualist, anarchism, in, the, work, and, activism, of, charles, auguste, bontemps, 1893, 1981, and, others, in, the, spanish, individualist, anarchist, magazines, tica, and, iniciales, there, is, a, strong, interest, in, publishing, scientific, news, usually, linked, to, a, certain, atheist, and, anti, theist, obsession, philosophy, which, will, also, work, for, pointing, out, the, incompatibility, between, science, and, religion, faith, and, reason, in, this, way, there, will, be, a, lot, of, talk, on, charles, darwin, s, theories, or, on, the, negation, of, the, existence, of, the, soul, in, 1901, the, catalan, anarchist, and, freethinker, francesc, ferrer, i, gu, rdia, established, modern, or, progressive, schools, in, barcelona, in, defiance, of, an, educational, system, controlled, by, the, catholic, church, the, schools, had, the, stated, goal, to, educate, the, working, class, in, a, rational, secular, and, non, coercive, setting, fiercely, anti, clerical, ferrer, believed, in, freedom, in, education, education, free, from, the, authority, of, church, and, state, ferrer, s, ideas, generally, formed, the, inspiration, for, a, series, of, modern, schools, in, the, united, states, cuba, south, america, and, london, the, first, of, these, started, in, new, york, city, in, 1911, ferrer, also, inspired, the, italian, newspaper, universit, popolare, founded, in, 1901, freemasonry, served, an, important, purpose, in, the, spreading, of, the, freethinking, movement, freemason, lodges, in, 18th, century, europe, served, as, sites, for, enlightenment, thinking, and, discussion, of, new, ideas, helping, spread, freethought, philosophies, the, informal, secretive, nature, of, the, lodges, allowed, intellectuals, and, elites, to, gather, and, debate, radical, topics, away, from, the, scrutiny, of, church, and, state, freemasonry, attracted, many, freethinkers, and, became, a, hub, of, the, movement, during, the, enlightenment, era, due, to, its, emphasis, on, inclusive, membership, logic, rationalism, and, religious, tolerance, freemasonry, s, origins, from, stonemason, guilds, meant, its, symbolism, and, rituals, drew, on, concepts, from, the, trivium, and, quadrivium, they, include, the, mastery, of, grammar, rhetoric, logic, then, mastery, of, arithmetic, geometry, music, and, astronomy, as, well, as, other, arts, such, as, the, mechanical, arts, reflecting, enlightenment, ideals, in, the, goal, of, making, its, members, masters, of, their, thoughts, and, opinions, thus, making, them, freethinkers, this, distinguished, freemasonry, from, other, fraternal, orders, focused, on, chivalry, or, christian, morality, due, to, freemasonry, utilizing, extensive, symbols, and, allegories, related, to, mathematics, geometry, and, architecture, conveying, the, importance, of, reason, and, science, and, the, central, masonic, symbol, of, the, compass, and, square, represented, logic, and, rigor, as, well, references, to, the, great, architect, of, the, universe, these, concepts, were, interpreted, as, a, deist, scientific, creator, by, enlightenment, freethinkers, influential, early, speculative, masonic, writings, by, james, anderson, and, jean, theophile, desaguliers, frequently, cited, isaac, newton, and, promoted, newtonian, scientific, ideas, desaguliers, was, a, close, friend, and, student, of, newton, further, spreading, newton, s, theories, to, lodges, geometry, textbooks, and, lectures, were, common, in, early, lodges, aligning, with, enlightenment, interest, in, mathematics, and, science, freemasonry, s, multi, tiered, system, of, initiation, rituals, allegorically, used, the, tools, stages, and, concepts, of, architecture, and, mechanics, to, represent, enlightenment, and, self, improvement, through, education, and, reason, this, resonated, with, freethinkers, belief, in, perfecting, society, through, spreading, knowledge, unlike, most, contemporary, fraternal, orders, freemasonry, did, not, require, its, members, to, follow, a, specific, religious, creed, this, openness, allowed, men, of, diverse, faiths, including, freethinkers, and, deists, to, join, local, lodges, throughout, europe, and, america, in, the, enlightenment, era, while, utilizing, religious, imagery, and, themes, freemasonry, intentionally, avoided, dogmatic, disputes, and, focused, its, moral, lessons, on, shared, values, of, virtue, charity, and, righteousness, this, religious, tolerance, attracted, enlightenment, thinkers, like, voltaire, who, viewed, organized, religion, as, upholding, oppressive, traditional, monarchs, and, hindering, free, thought, benjamin, franklin, praised, masonic, principles, of, liberality, tolerance, and, unity, in, essentials, leaving, each, brother, to, his, own, opinions, on, non, essentials, in, his, writings, many, enlightenment, freethinkers, perceived, established, religion, as, upholding, traditional, monarchies, and, oppressing, free, thought, consequently, the, secrecy, and, hierarchical, initiatory, structure, of, freemasonry, alarmed, some, authoritarian, states, concerned, it, could, encourage, liberal, revolutionary, ideas, however, most, masonic, lodges, mainly, aimed, to, promote, morality, sociability, and, philanthropic, causes, rather, than, radical, politics, values, of, freethinking, liberty, equality, and, opposition, to, tyranny, were, also, celebrated, in, masonic, rituals, and, writings, this, intellectual, spirit, likely, contributed, to, many, freemasons, supporting, independence, movements, and, participating, as, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, some, authoritarian, states, also, suspected, freemasonry, of, encouraging, liberal, freethinking, philosophies, and, suppressed, masonic, lodges, a, core, goal, of, freemasonry, s, initiatory, system, is, to, guide, men, s, intellectual, and, moral, development, towards, mastery, and, enlightenment, masonic, rituals, and, degrees, symbolically, depict, the, passage, from, an, apprentice, to, fellowcraft, to, master, mason, as, a, metaphor, for, independent, learning, and, self, improvement, to, the, goal, of, becoming, a, master, of, himself, thus, a, full, freethinker, attaining, mastery, is, presented, as, freeing, a, man, s, mind, from, reliance, on, authorities, and, dogmas, so, he, can, autonomously, reason, and, have, educated, opinions, the, perfectibility, of, human, nature, through, education, and, liberty, is, a, key, theme, this, aligns, with, freethinkers, views, on, thinking, for, oneself, using, logic, and, empiricism, even, before, accepting, the, religion, of, the, arabs, the, turks, were, a, great, nation, after, accepting, the, religion, of, the, arabs, this, religion, didn, t, effect, to, combine, the, arabs, the, persians, and, egyptians, with, the, turks, to, constitute, a, nation, this, religion, rather, loosened, the, national, nexus, of, turkish, nation, got, national, excitement, numb, this, was, very, natural, because, the, purpose, of, the, religion, founded, by, muhammad, over, all, nations, was, to, drag, to, an, including, arab,
