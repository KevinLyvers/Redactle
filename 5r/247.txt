divine, islamic, law, as, revealed, in, the, quran, and, the, sunnah, the, teachings, and, practices, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, and, his, companions, fiqh, expands, and, develops, shariah, through, interpretation, ijtihad, of, the, quran, and, sunnah, by, islamic, jurists, ulama, and, is, implemented, by, the, rulings, fatwa, of, jurists, on, questions, presented, to, them, thus, whereas, sharia, is, considered, immutable, and, infallible, by, muslims, fiqh, is, considered, fallible, and, changeable, fiqh, deals, with, the, observance, of, rituals, morals, and, social, legislation, in, islam, as, well, as, economic, and, political, system, in, the, modern, era, there, are, four, prominent, schools, madh, hab, of, fiqh, within, sunni, practice, plus, two, or, three, within, shi, a, practice, a, person, trained, in, fiqh, is, known, as, a, faq, h, pl, fuqaha, figuratively, fiqh, means, knowledge, about, islamic, legal, rulings, from, their, sources, deriving, religious, rulings, from, their, sources, requires, the, mujtahid, an, individual, who, exercises, ijtihad, to, have, a, deep, understanding, in, the, different, discussions, of, jurisprudence, a, faq, h, must, look, deep, down, into, a, matter, and, not, content, himself, with, just, the, apparent, meaning, and, a, person, who, only, knows, the, appearance, of, a, matter, is, not, qualified, as, a, faq, h, the, studies, of, fiqh, are, traditionally, divided, into, u, l, al, fiqh, principles, of, islamic, jurisprudence, lit, the, roots, of, fiqh, alternatively, transliterated, as, usool,

islamic, sources, which, are, studied, in, the, principles, of, islamic, jurisprudence, and, the, process, of, gaining, knowledge, of, islam, through, jurisprudence, the, historian, ibn, khaldun, describes, fiqh, as, knowledge, of, the, rules, of, god, which, concern, the, actions, of, persons, who, own, themselves, connected, to, obey, the, law, respecting, what, is, required, wajib, sinful, haraam, recommended, mand, b, disapproved, makr, h, or, neutral, mubah, this, definition, is, consistent, amongst, the, jurists, in, modern, standard, arabic, fiqh, has, also, come, to, mean, islamic, jurisprudence, it, is, not, thus, possible, to, speak, of, chief, justice, john, roberts, as, an, expert, in, the, common, law, fiqh, of, the, united, states, or, of, egyptian, legal, scholar, abd, el, razzak, el, sanhuri, as, an, expert, in, the, civil, law, fiqh, of, egypt, according, to, sunni, islamic, history, sunni, law, followed, a, chronological, path, of, the, commands, and, prohibitions, chosen, by, god, were, revealed, through, the, agency, of, the, prophet, in, both, the, quran, and, the, sunnah, words, deeds, and, examples, of, the, prophet, passed, down, as, hadith, the, first, muslims, the, sahabah, or, companions, heard, and, obeyed, and, passed, this, essence, of, islam, to, succeeding, generations, tabi, un, and, tabi, al, tabi, in, or, successors, followers, and, successors, of, successors, as, muslims, and, islam, spread, from, west, arabia, to, the, conquered, lands, north, east, and, west, where, it, was, systematized, and, elaborated, the, history, of, islamic, jurisprudence, is, customarily, divided, into, eight, periods, the, formative, period, of, islamic, jurisprudence, stretches, back, to, the, time, of, the, early, muslim, communities, during, this, period, jurists, were, more, concerned, with, issues, of, authority, and, teaching, than, with, theory, and, methodology, progress, in, theory, and, methodology, happened, with, the, coming, of, the, early, muslim, jurist, muhammad, ibn, idris, ash, shafi, i, 767, 820, who, codified, the, basic, principles, of, islamic, jurisprudence, in, his, book, ar, ris, lah, the, book, details, the, four, roots, of, law, qur, an, sunnah, ijma, and, qiyas, while, specifying, that, the, primary, islamic, texts, the, qur, an, and, the, hadith, be, understood, according, to, objective, rules, of, interpretation, derived, from, scientific, study, of, the, arabic, language, secondary, sources, of, law, were, developed, and, refined, over, the, subsequent, centuries, consisting, primarily, of, juristic, preference, istihsan, laws, of, the, previous, prophets, shara, man, qablana, continuity, istishab, extended, analogy, maslaha, mursala, blocking, the, means, sadd, al, dhari, ah, local, customs, urf, and, sayings, of, a, companion, of, the, prophet, qawl, al, sahabi, the, quran, set, the, rights, responsibilities, and, rules, for, people, and, societies, to, adhere, to, such, as, dealing, in, interest, muhammad, then, provided, an, example, which, is, recorded, in, the, hadith, books, showing, people, how, he, practically, implemented, these, rules, in, a, society, after, the, passing, of, muhammad, there, was, a, need, for, jurists, to, decide, on, new, legal, matters, where, there, is, no, such, ruling, in, the, quran, or, the, hadith, example, of, islamic, prophet, muhammad, regarding, a, similar, case, in, the, years, proceeding, muhammad, the, community, in, madina, continued, to, use, the, same, rules, people, were, familiar, with, the, practice, of, muhammad, and, therefore, continued, to, use, the, same, rules, the, scholars, appearing, in, the, diagram, below, were, taught, by, muhammad, s, companions, many, of, whom, settled, in, madina, muwatta, by, malik, ibn, anas, was, written, as, a, consensus, of, the, opinion, of, these, scholars, muwatta, by, malik, ibn, anas, quotes, 13, hadiths, from, imam, jafar, al, sadiq, aisha, also, taught, her, nephew, urwah, ibn, zubayr, he, then, taught, his, son, hisham, ibn, urwah, who, was, the, main, teacher, of, malik, ibn, anas, whose, views, many, sunni, follow, and, also, taught, by, jafar, al, sadiq, qasim, ibn, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, hisham, ibn, urwah, and, muhammad, al, baqir, taught, zayd, ibn, ali, jafar, al, sadiq, abu, hanifa, and, malik, ibn, anas, imam, jafar, al, sadiq, imam, abu, hanifa, and, malik, ibn, anas, worked, together, in, al, masjid, an, nabawi, in, medina, along, with, qasim, ibn, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, muhammad, al, baqir, zayd, ibn, ali, and, over, 70, other, leading, jurists, and, scholars, al, shafi, i, was, taught, by, malik, ibn, anas, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, was, taught, by, al, shafi, i, muhammad, al, bukhari, travelled, everywhere, collecting, hadith, and, his, father, ismail, ibn, ibrahim, was, a, student, of, malik, ibn, anas, in, the, books, actually, written, by, these, original, jurists, and, scholars, there, are, very, few, theological, and, judicial, differences, between, them, imam, ahmad, rejected, the, writing, down, and, codifying, of, the, religious, rulings, he, gave, they, knew, that, they, might, have, fallen, into, error, in, some, of, their, judgements, and, stated, this, clearly, they, never, introduced, their, rulings, by, saying, here, this, judgement, is, the, judgement, of, god, and, his, prophet, there, is, also, very, little, text, actually, written, down, by, jafar, al, sadiq, himself, they, all, give, priority, to, the, qur, an, and, the, hadith, the, practice, of, muhammad, they, felt, that, the, quran, and, the, hadith, the, example, of, muhammad, provided, people, with, almost, everything, they, needed, this, day, i, have, perfected, for, you, your, religion, and, completed, my, favor, upon, you, and, have, approved, for, you, islam, as, religion, qur, an, 5, 3, these, scholars, did, not, distinguish, between, each, other, they, were, not, sunni, or, shia, they, felt, that, they, were, following, the, religion, of, abraham, as, described, in, the, quran, say, allah, speaks, the, truth, so, follow, the, religion, of, abraham, the, upright, one, and, he, was, not, one, of, the, polytheists, qur, an, 3, 95, most, of, the, differences, are, regarding, sharia, laws, devised, through, ijtihad, where, there, is, no, such, ruling, in, the, quran, or, the, hadiths, of, islamic, prophet, muhammad, regarding, a, similar, case, as, these, jurists, went, to, new, areas, they, were, pragmatic, and, continued, to, use, the, same, ruling, as, was, given, in, that, area, during, pre, islamic, times, if, the, population, felt, comfortable, with, it, it, was, just, and, they, used, ijtihad, to, deduce, that, it, did, not, conflict, with, the, quran, or, the, hadith, as, explained, in, the, muwatta, by, malik, ibn, anas, this, made, it, easier, for, the, different, communities, to, integrate, into, the, islamic, state, and, assisted, in, the, quick, expansion, of, the, islamic, state, to, reduce, the, divergence, ash, shafi, i, proposed, giving, priority, to, the, qur, an, and, the, hadith, the, practice, of, muhammad, and, only, then, look, at, the, consensus, of, the, muslim, jurists, ijma, and, analogical, reasoning, qiyas, this, then, resulted, in, jurists, like, muhammad, al, bukhari, dedicating, their, lives, to, the, collection, of, the, correct, hadith, in, books, like, sahih, al, bukhari, sahih, translates, as, authentic, or, correct, they, also, felt, that, muhammad, s, judgement, was, more, impartial, and, better, than, their, own, these, original, jurists, and, scholars, also, acted, as, a, counterbalance, to, the, rulers, when, they, saw, injustice, all, these, scholars, spoke, out, against, it, as, the, state, expanded, outside, madina, the, rights, of, the, different, communities, as, they, were, constituted, in, the, constitution, of, medina, still, applied, the, quran, also, gave, additional, rights, to, the, citizens, of, the, state, and, these, rights, were, also, applied, ali, hassan, and, husayn, ibn, ali, gave, their, allegiance, to, the, first, three, caliphs, because, they, abided, by, these, conditions, later, ali, the, fourth, caliph, wrote, in, a, letter, i, did, not, approach, the, people, to, get, their, oath, of, allegiance, but, they, came, to, me, with, their, desire, to, make, me, their, amir, ruler, i, did, not, extend, my, hands, towards, them, so, that, they, might, swear, the, oath, of, allegiance, to, me, but, they, themselves, extended, their, hands, towards, me, but, later, as, fate, would, have, it, predestination, in, islam, when, yazid, i, an, oppressive, ruler, took, power, husayn, ibn, ali, the, grandson, of, muhammad, felt, that, it, was, a, test, from, god, for, him, and, his, duty, to, confront, him, then, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, qasim, ibn, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, s, cousin, confronted, the, umayyad, rulers, after, husayn, ibn, ali, was, betrayed, by, the, people, of, kufa, and, killed, by, syrian, roman, army, now, under, the, control, of, the, yazid, i, the, umayyad, ruler, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, then, took, on, the, umayyads, and, expelled, their, forces, from, hijaz, and, iraq, but, then, his, forces, were, depleted, in, iraq, trying, to, stop, the, khawarij, the, umayyads, then, moved, in, after, a, lengthy, campaign, in, his, last, hour, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, asked, his, mother, asma, bint, abu, bakr, the, daughter, of, abu, bakr, the, first, caliph, for, advice, asma, bint, abu, bakr, replied, to, her, son, she, said, you, know, better, in, your, own, self, that, if, you, are, upon, the, truth, and, you, are, calling, towards, the, truth, go, forth, for, people, more, honourable, than, you, have, been, killed, and, if, you, are, not, upon, the, truth, then, what, an, evil, son, you, are, and, you, have, destroyed, yourself, and, those, who, are, with, you, if, you, say, that, if, you, are, upon, the, truth, and, you, will, be, killed, at, the, hands, of, others, then, you, will, not, truly, be, free, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, left, and, was, later, also, killed, and, crucified, by, the, syrian, roman, army, now, under, the, control, of, the, umayyads, and, led, by, hajjaj, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, the, son, of, abu, bakr, the, first, caliph, and, raised, by, ali, the, fourth, caliph, was, also, killed, by, the, umayyads, aisha, then, raised, and, taught, her, son, qasim, ibn, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, who, later, taught, his, grandson, jafar, al, sadiq, during, the, early, umayyad, period, there, was, more, community, involvement, the, quran, and, muhammad, s, example, was, the, main, source, of, law, after, which, the, community, decided, if, it, worked, for, the, community, was, just, and, did, not, conflict, with, the, quran, and, the, example, of, muhammad, it, was, accepted, this, made, it, easier, for, the, different, communities, with, roman, persian, central, asia, and, north, african, backgrounds, to, integrate, into, the, islamic, state, and, that, assisted, in, the, quick, expansion, of, the, islamic, state, the, scholars, in, madina, were, consulted, on, the, more, complex, judicial, issues, the, sharia, and, the, official, more, centralized, schools, of, fiqh, developed, later, during, the, time, of, the, abbasids, the, sources, of, sharia, in, order, of, importance, are, primary, sources, secondary, sources, majority, of, sunni, muslims, view, qiyas, as, a, central, pillar, of, ijtihad, on, the, other, hand, zahirites, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, al, bukhari, early, hanbalites, etc, rejected, qiyas, amongst, the, sunnis, similarly, the, shi, a, jurists, almost, unanimously, reject, both, pure, reason, and, analogical, reason, viewing, both, these, methods, as, subjective, the, qur, an, gives, clear, instructions, on, many, issues, such, as, how, to, perform, the, ritual, purification, wudu, before, the, obligatory, daily, prayers, salat, on, other, issues, for, example, the, qur, an, states, one, needs, to, engage, in, daily, prayers, salat, and, fast, sawm, during, the, month, of, ramadan, but, further, instructions, and, details, on, how, to, perform, these, duties, can, be, found, in, the, traditions, of, muhammad, so, qur, an, and, sunnah, are, in, most, cases, the, basis, for, shariah, some, topics, are, without, precedent, in, islam, s, early, period, in, those, cases, muslim, jurists, fuqaha, try, to, arrive, at, conclusions, by, other, means, sunni, jurists, use, historical, consensus, of, the, community, ijma, a, majority, in, the, modern, era, also, use, analogy, qiyas, and, weigh, the, harms, and, benefits, of, new, topics, istislah, and, a, plurality, utilizes, juristic, preference, istihsan, the, conclusions, arrived, at, with, the, aid, of, these, additional, tools, constitute, a, wide, array, of, laws, and, its, application, is, called, fiqh, thus, in, contrast, to, the, sharia, fiqh, is, not, regarded, as, sacred, and, the, schools, of, thought, have, differing, views, on, its, details, without, viewing, other, conclusions, as, sacrilegious, this, division, of, interpretation, in, more, detailed, issues, has, resulted, in, different, schools, of, thought, madh, hab, this, wider, concept, of, islamic, jurisprudence, is, the, source, of, a, range, of, laws, in, different, topics, that, guide, muslims, in, everyday, life, islamic, jurisprudence, fiqh, covers, two, main, areas, these, types, of, rules, can, also, fall, into, two, groups, rules, in, relation, to, actions, amaliyya, or, decision, types, comprise, rules, in, relation, to, circumstances, wadia, comprise, the, modus, operandi, of, the, muslim, jurist, is, known, as, usul, al, fiqh, principles, of, jurisprudence, there, are, different, approaches, to, the, methodology, used, in, jurisprudence, to, derive, islamic, rulings, from, the, primary, sources, of, sharia, islamic, law, the, main, methodologies, are, those, of, the, sunni, shi, a, and, ibadi, denominations, while, both, sunni, and, shi, ite, shia, are, divided, into, smaller, sub, schools, the, differences, among, the, shi, ite, schools, is, considerably, greater, ibadites, only, follow, a, single, school, without, divisions, while, using, court, decisions, as, legal, precedents, and, case, law, are, central, to, western, law, the, importance, of, the, institution, of, fatawa, non, binding, answers, by, islamic, legal, scholars, to, legal, questions, has, been, called, central, to, the, development, of, islamic, jurisprudence, this, is, in, part, because, of, a, vacuum, in, the, other, source, of, islamic, law, qada, legal, rulings, by, state, appointed, islamic, judges, after, the, fall, of, the, last, caliphate, the, ottoman, empire, while, the, practice, in, islam, dates, back, to, the, time, of, muhammad, according, to, at, least, one, source, muhammad, el, gamal, it, is, modeled, after, the, roman, system, of, responsa, and, gives, the, questioner, decisive, primary, mover, advantage, in, choosing, the, question, and, its, wording, each, school, madhhab, reflects, a, unique, urf, or, culture, a, cultural, practice, that, was, influenced, by, traditions, that, the, classical, jurists, themselves, lived, in, when, rulings, were, made, some, suggest, that, the, discipline, of, isnad, which, developed, to, validate, hadith, made, it, relatively, easy, to, record, and, validate, also, the, rulings, of, jurists, this, in, turn, made, them, far, easier, to, imitate, taqlid, than, to, challenge, in, new, contexts, the, argument, is, the, schools, have, been, more, or, less, frozen, for, centuries, and, reflect, a, culture, that, simply, no, longer, exists, traditional, scholars, hold, that, religion, is, there, to, regulate, human, behavior, and, nurture, people, s, moral, side, and, since, human, nature, has, not, fundamentally, changed, since, the, beginning, of, islam, a, call, to, modernize, the, religion, is, essentially, one, to, relax, all, laws, and, institutions, early, shariah, had, a, much, more, flexible, character, and, some, modern, muslim, scholars, believe, that, it, should, be, renewed, and, that, the, classical, jurists, should, lose, special, status, this, would, require, formulating, a, new, fiqh, suitable, for, the, modern, world, e, g, as, proposed, by, advocates, of, the, islamization, of, knowledge, which, would, deal, with, the, modern, context, this, modernization, is, opposed, by, most, conservative, ulema, traditional, scholars, hold, that, the, laws, are, contextual, and, consider, circumstance, such, as, time, place, and, culture, the, principles, they, are, based, upon, are, universal, such, as, justice, equality, and, respect, many, muslim, scholars, argue, that, even, though, technology, may, have, advanced, the, fundamentals, of, human, life, have, not, there, are, several, schools, of, fiqh, thought, arabic, ma, hab, pl, ma, hib, the, schools, of, sunni, islam, are, each, named, by, students, of, the, classical, jurist, who, taught, them, the, sunni, schools, and, where, they, are, commonly, found, are, the, schools, of, shia, islam, comprise, entirely, separate, from, both, the, sunni, and, shia, traditions, khawarij, islam, has, evolved, its, own, distinct, school, these, schools, share, many, of, their, rulings, but, differ, on, the, particular, hadiths, they, accept, as, authentic, and, the, weight, they, give, to, analogy, or, reason, qiyas, in, deciding, difficulties, the, relationship, between, at, least, the, sunni, schools, of, jurisprudence, and, the, conflict, between, the, unity, of, the, shariah, and, the, diversity, of, the, schools, was, expressed, by, the, 12th, century, hanafi, scholar, abu, hafs, umar, al, nasafi, who, wrote, our, school, is, correct, with, the, possibility, of, error, and, another, school, is, in, error, with, the, possibility, of, being, correct, a, number, of, important, legal, institutions, were, developed, by, muslim, jurists, during, the, classical, period, of, islam, known, as, the, islamic, golden, age, one, such, institution, was, the, hawala, an, early, informal, value, transfer, system, which, is, mentioned, in, texts, of, islamic, jurisprudence, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, hawala, itself, later, influenced, the, development, of, the, agency, in, common, law, and, in, civil, laws, such, as, the, aval, in, french, law, and, the, avallo, in, italian, law, the, waqf, in, islamic, law, which, developed, during, the, 7th, 9th, centuries, bears, a, notable, resemblance, to, the, trusts, in, the, english, trust, law, for, example, every, waqf, was, required, to, have, a, waqif, settlor, mutawillis, trustee, qadi, judge, and, beneficiaries, the, trust, law, developed, in, england, at, the, time, of, the, crusades, during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, was, introduced, by, crusaders, who, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, waqf, institutions, they, came, across, in, the, middle, east, in, classical, islamic, jurisprudence, litigants, in, court, may, obtain, notarized, statements, from, between, three, and, twelve, witnesses, when, the, statements, of, all, witnesses, are, consistent, the, notaries, will, certify, their, unanimous, testimony, in, a, legal, document, which, may, be, used, to, support, the, litigant, s, claim, the, notaries, serve, to, free, the, judge, from, the, time, consuming, task, of, hearing, the, testimony, of, each, eyewitness, himself, and, their, documents, serve, to, legally, authenticate, each, oral, testimony, the, maliki, school, requires, two, notaries, to, collect, a, minimum, of, twelve, eyewitness, statements, in, certain, legal, cases, including, those, involving, unregistered, marriages, and, land, disputes, john, makdisi, has, compared, this, group, of, twelve, witness, statements, known, as, a, lafif, to, english, common, law, jury, trials, under, henry, ii, surmising, a, link, between, the, king, s, reforms, and, the, legal, system, of, the, kingdom, of, sicily, the, island, had, previously, been, ruled, by, various, islamic, dynasties, several, other, fundamental, common, law, institutions, may, have, been, adapted, from, similar, legal, institutions, in, islamic, law, and, jurisprudence, and, introduced, to, england, by, the, normans, after, the, norman, conquest, of, england, and, the, emirate, of, sicily, and, by, crusaders, during, the, crusades, in, particular, the, royal, english, contract, protected, by, the, action, of, debt, is, identified, with, the, islamic, aqd, the, english, assize, of, novel, disseisin, is, identified, with, the, islamic, istihqaq, and, the, english, jury, is, identified, with, the, islamic, lafif, john, makdisi, speculated, that, english, legal, institutions, such, as, the, scholastic, method, the, licence, to, teach, the, law, schools, known, as, inns, of, court, in, england, and, madrasas, in, islam, and, the, european, commenda, islamic, qirad, may, have, also, originated, from, islamic, law, the, methodology, of, legal, precedent, and, reasoning, by, analogy, qiyas, are, also, similar, in, both, the, islamic, and, common, law, systems, these, influences, have, led, some, scholars, to, suggest, that, islamic, law, may, have, laid, the, foundations, for, the, common, law, as, an, integrated, whole
