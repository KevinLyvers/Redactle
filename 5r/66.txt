https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism
in, philosophy, rationalism, is, the, epistemological, view, that, regards, reason, as, the, chief, source, and, test, of, knowledge, or, any, view, appealing, to, reason, as, a, source, of, knowledge, or, justification, often, in, contrast, to, other, possible, sources, of, knowledge, such, as, faith, tradition, or, sensory, experience, more, formally, rationalism, is, defined, as, a, methodology, or, a, theory, in, which, the, criterion, of, truth, is, not, sensory, but, intellectual, and, deductive, in, a, major, philosophical, debate, during, the, enlightenment, rationalism, sometimes, here, equated, with, innatism, was, opposed, to, empiricism, on, the, one, hand, the, rationalists, emphasized, that, knowledge, is, primarily, innate, and, the, intellect, the, inner, faculty, of, the, human, mind, can, therefore, directly, grasp, or, derive, logical, truths, on, the, other, hand, the, empiricists, emphasized, that, knowledge, is, not, primarily, innate, and, is, best, gained, by, careful, observation, of, the, physical, world, outside, the, mind, namely, through, sensory, experiences, rationalists, asserted, that, certain, principles, exist, in, logic, mathematics, ethics, and, metaphysics, that, are, so, fundamentally, true, that, denying, them, causes, one, to, fall, into, contradiction, the, rationalists, had, such, a, high, confidence, in, reason, that, empirical, proof, and, physical, evidence, were, regarded, as, unnecessary, to, ascertain, certain, truths, in, other, words, there, are, significant, ways, in, which, our, concepts, and, knowledge, are, gained, independently, of, sense, experience, different, degrees, of, emphasis, on, this, method, or, theory, lead, to, a, range, of, rationalist, standpoints, from, the, moderate, position, that, reason, has, precedence, over, other, ways, of, acquiring, knowledge, to, the, more, extreme, position, that, reason, is, the, unique, path, to, knowledge, given, a, pre, modern, understanding, of, reason, rationalism, is, identical, to, philosophy, the, socratic, life, of, inquiry, or, the, zetetic, skeptical, clear, interpretation, of, authority, open, to, the, underlying, or, essential, cause, of, things, as, they, appear, to, our, sense, of, certainty, rationalism, as, an, appeal, to, human, reason, as, a, way, of, obtaining, knowledge, has, a, philosophical, history, dating, from, antiquity, the, analytical, nature, of, much, of, philosophical, enquiry, the, awareness, of, apparently, a, priori, domains, of, knowledge, such, as, mathematics, combined, with, the, emphasis, of, obtaining, knowledge, through, the, use, of, rational, faculties, commonly, rejecting, for, example, direct, revelation, have, made, rationalist, themes, very, prevalent, in, the, history, of, philosophy, since, the, enlightenment, rationalism, is, usually, associated, with, the, introduction, of, mathematical, methods, into, philosophy, as, seen, in, the, works, of, descartes, leibniz, and, spinoza, this, is, commonly, called, continental, rationalism, because, it, was, predominant, in, the, continental, schools, of, europe, whereas, in, britain, empiricism, dominated, even, then, the, distinction, between, rationalists, and, empiricists, was, drawn, at, a, later, period, and, would, not, have, been, recognized, by, the, philosophers, involved, also, the, distinction, between, the, two, philosophies, is, not, as, clear, cut, as, is, sometimes, suggested, for, example, descartes, and, locke, have, similar, views, about, the, nature, of, human, ideas, proponents, of, some, varieties, of, rationalism, argue, that, starting, with, foundational, basic, principles, like, the, axioms, of, geometry, one, could, deductively, derive, the, rest, of, all, possible, knowledge, notable, philosophers, who, held, this, view, most, clearly, were, baruch, spinoza, and, gottfried, leibniz, whose, attempts, to, grapple, with, the, epistemological, and, metaphysical, problems, raised, by, descartes, led, to, a, development, of, the, fundamental, approach, of, rationalism, both, spinoza, and, leibniz, asserted, that, in, principle, all, knowledge, including, scientific, knowledge, could, be, gained, through, the, use, of, reason, alone, though, they, both, observed, that, this, was, not, possible, in, practice, for, human, beings, except, in, specific, areas, such, as, mathematics, on, the, other, hand, leibniz, admitted, in, his, book, monadology, that, we, are, all, mere, empirics, in, three, fourths, of, our, actions, in, politics, rationalism, since, the, enlightenment, historically, emphasized, a, politics, of, reason, centered, upon, rational, choice, deontology, utilitarianism, secularism, and, irreligion, the, latter, aspect, s, antitheism, was, later, softened, by, the, adoption, of, pluralistic, reasoning, methods, practicable, regardless, of, religious, or, irreligious, ideology, in, this, regard, the, philosopher, john, cottingham, noted, how, rationalism, a, methodology, became, socially, conflated, with, atheism, a, worldview, in, the, past, particularly, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, term, rationalist, was, often, used, to, refer, to, free, thinkers, of, an, anti, clerical, and, anti, religious, outlook, and, for, a, time, the, word, acquired, a, distinctly, pejorative, force, thus, in, 1670, sanderson, spoke, disparagingly, of, a, mere, rationalist, that, is, to, say, in, plain, english, an, atheist, of, the, late, edition, the, use, of, the, label, rationalist, to, characterize, a, world, outlook, which, has, no, place, for, the, supernatural, is, becoming, less, popular, today, terms, like, humanist, or, materialist, seem, largely, to, have, taken, its, place, but, the, old, usage, still, survives, rationalism, is, often, contrasted, with, empiricism, taken, very, broadly, these, views, are, not, mutually, exclusive, since, a, philosopher, can, be, both, rationalist, and, empiricist, taken, to, extremes, the, empiricist, view, holds, that, all, ideas, come, to, us, a, posteriori, that, is, to, say, through, experience, either, through, the, external, senses, or, through, such, inner, sensations, as, pain, and, gratification, the, empiricist, essentially, believes, that, knowledge, is, based, on, or, derived, directly, from, experience, the, rationalist, believes, we, come, to, knowledge, a, priori, through, the, use, of, logic, and, is, thus, independent, of, sensory, experience, in, other, words, as, galen, strawson, once, wrote, you, can, see, that, it, is, true, just, lying, on, your, couch, you, don, t, have, to, get, up, off, your, couch, and, go, outside, and, examine, the, way, things, are, in, the, physical, world, you, don, t, have, to, do, any, science, between, both, philosophies, the, issue, at, hand, is, the, fundamental, source, of, human, knowledge, and, the, proper, techniques, for, verifying, what, we, think, we, know, whereas, both, philosophies, are, under, the, umbrella, of, epistemology, their, argument, lies, in, the, understanding, of, the, warrant, which, is, under, the, wider, epistemic, umbrella, of, the, theory, of, justification, part, of, epistemology, this, theory, attempts, to, understand, the, justification, of, propositions, and, beliefs, epistemologists, are, concerned, with, various, epistemic, features, of, belief, which, include, the, ideas, of, justification, warrant, rationality, and, probability, of, these, four, terms, the, term, that, has, been, most, widely, used, and, discussed, by, the, early, 21st, century, is, warrant, loosely, speaking, justification, is, the, reason, that, someone, probably, holds, a, belief, if, a, makes, a, claim, and, then, b, casts, doubt, on, it, a, s, next, move, would, normally, be, to, provide, justification, for, the, claim, the, precise, method, one, uses, to, provide, justification, is, where, the, lines, are, drawn, between, rationalism, and, empiricism, among, other, philosophical, views, much, of, the, debate, in, these, fields, are, focused, on, analyzing, the, nature, of, knowledge, and, how, it, relates, to, connected, notions, such, as, truth, belief, and, justification, at, its, core, rationalism, consists, of, three, basic, claims, for, people, to, consider, themselves, rationalists, they, must, adopt, at, least, one, of, these, three, claims, the, intuition, deduction, thesis, the, innate, knowledge, thesis, or, the, innate, concept, thesis, in, addition, a, rationalist, can, choose, to, adopt, the, claim, of, indispensability, of, reason, and, or, the, claim, of, superiority, of, reason, although, one, can, be, a, rationalist, without, adopting, either, thesis, the, indispensability, of, reason, thesis, the, knowledge, we, gain, in, subject, area, s, by, intuition, and, deduction, as, well, as, the, ideas, and, instances, of, knowledge, in, s, that, are, innate, to, us, could, not, have, been, gained, by, us, through, sense, experience, in, short, this, thesis, claims, that, experience, cannot, provide, what, we, gain, from, reason, the, superiority, of, reason, thesis, the, knowledge, we, gain, in, subject, area, s, by, intuition, and, deduction, or, have, innately, is, superior, to, any, knowledge, gained, by, sense, experience, in, other, words, this, thesis, claims, reason, is, superior, to, experience, as, a, source, for, knowledge, rationalists, often, adopt, similar, stances, on, other, aspects, of, philosophy, most, rationalists, reject, skepticism, for, the, areas, of, knowledge, they, claim, are, knowable, a, priori, when, you, claim, some, truths, are, innately, known, to, us, one, must, reject, skepticism, in, relation, to, those, truths, especially, for, rationalists, who, adopt, the, intuition, deduction, thesis, the, idea, of, epistemic, foundationalism, tends, to, crop, up, this, is, the, view, that, we, know, some, truths, without, basing, our, belief, in, them, on, any, others, and, that, we, then, use, this, foundational, knowledge, to, know, more, truths, some, propositions, in, a, particular, subject, area, s, are, knowable, by, us, by, intuition, alone, still, others, are, knowable, by, being, deduced, from, intuited, propositions, generally, speaking, intuition, is, a, priori, knowledge, or, experiential, belief, characterized, by, its, immediacy, a, form, of, rational, insight, we, simply, see, something, in, such, a, way, as, to, give, us, a, warranted, belief, beyond, that, the, nature, of, intuition, is, hotly, debated, in, the, same, way, generally, speaking, deduction, is, the, process, of, reasoning, from, one, or, more, general, premises, to, reach, a, logically, certain, conclusion, using, valid, arguments, we, can, deduce, from, intuited, premises, for, example, when, we, combine, both, concepts, we, can, intuit, that, the, number, three, is, prime, and, that, it, is, greater, than, two, we, then, deduce, from, this, knowledge, that, there, is, a, prime, number, greater, than, two, thus, it, can, be, said, that, intuition, and, deduction, combined, to, provide, us, with, a, priori, knowledge, we, gained, this, knowledge, independently, of, sense, experience, to, argue, in, favor, of, this, thesis, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, a, prominent, german, philosopher, says, the, senses, although, they, are, necessary, for, all, our, actual, knowledge, are, not, sufficient, to, give, us, the, whole, of, it, since, the, senses, never, give, anything, but, instances, that, is, to, say, particular, or, individual, truths, now, all, the, instances, which, confirm, a, general, truth, however, numerous, they, may, be, are, not, sufficient, to, establish, the, universal, necessity, of, this, same, truth, for, it, does, not, follow, that, what, happened, before, will, happen, in, the, same, way, again, from, which, it, appears, that, necessary, truths, such, as, we, find, in, pure, mathematics, and, particularly, in, arithmetic, and, geometry, must, have, principles, whose, proof, does, not, depend, on, instances, nor, consequently, on, the, testimony, of, the, senses, although, without, the, senses, it, would, never, have, occurred, to, us, to, think, of, them, empiricists, such, as, david, hume, have, been, willing, to, accept, this, thesis, for, describing, the, relationships, among, our, own, concepts, in, this, sense, empiricists, argue, that, we, are, allowed, to, intuit, and, deduce, truths, from, knowledge, that, has, been, obtained, a, posteriori, by, injecting, different, subjects, into, the, intuition, deduction, thesis, we, are, able, to, generate, different, arguments, most, rationalists, agree, mathematics, is, knowable, by, applying, the, intuition, and, deduction, some, go, further, to, include, ethical, truths, into, the, category, of, things, knowable, by, intuition, and, deduction, furthermore, some, rationalists, also, claim, metaphysics, is, knowable, in, this, thesis, naturally, the, more, subjects, the, rationalists, claim, to, be, knowable, by, the, intuition, deduction, thesis, the, more, certain, they, are, of, their, warranted, beliefs, and, the, more, strictly, they, adhere, to, the, infallibility, of, intuition, the, more, controversial, their, truths, or, claims, and, the, more, radical, their, rationalism, in, addition, to, different, subjects, rationalists, sometimes, vary, the, strength, of, their, claims, by, adjusting, their, understanding, of, the, warrant, some, rationalists, understand, warranted, beliefs, to, be, beyond, even, the, slightest, doubt, others, are, more, conservative, and, understand, the, warrant, to, be, belief, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, rationalists, also, have, different, understanding, and, claims, involving, the, connection, between, intuition, and, truth, some, rationalists, claim, that, intuition, is, infallible, and, that, anything, we, intuit, to, be, true, is, as, such, more, contemporary, rationalists, accept, that, intuition, is, not, always, a, source, of, certain, knowledge, thus, allowing, for, the, possibility, of, a, deceiver, who, might, cause, the, rationalist, to, intuit, a, false, proposition, in, the, same, way, a, third, party, could, cause, the, rationalist, to, have, perceptions, of, nonexistent, objects, we, have, knowledge, of, some, truths, in, a, particular, subject, area, s, as, part, of, our, rational, nature, the, innate, knowledge, thesis, is, similar, to, the, intuition, deduction, thesis, in, the, regard, that, both, theses, claim, knowledge, is, gained, a, priori, the, two, theses, go, their, separate, ways, when, describing, how, that, knowledge, is, gained, as, the, name, and, the, rationale, suggests, the, innate, knowledge, thesis, claims, knowledge, is, simply, part, of, our, rational, nature, experiences, can, trigger, a, process, that, allows, this, knowledge, to, come, into, our, consciousness, but, the, experiences, do, not, provide, us, with, the, knowledge, itself, the, knowledge, has, been, with, us, since, the, beginning, and, the, experience, simply, brought, into, focus, in, the, same, way, a, photographer, can, bring, the, background, of, a, picture, into, focus, by, changing, the, aperture, of, the, lens, the, background, was, always, there, just, not, in, focus, this, thesis, targets, a, problem, with, the, nature, of, inquiry, originally, postulated, by, plato, in, meno, here, plato, asks, about, inquiry, how, do, we, gain, knowledge, of, a, theorem, in, geometry, we, inquire, into, the, matter, yet, knowledge, by, inquiry, seems, impossible, in, other, words, if, we, already, have, the, knowledge, there, is, no, place, for, inquiry, if, we, lack, the, knowledge, we, don, t, know, what, we, are, seeking, and, cannot, recognize, it, when, we, find, it, either, way, we, cannot, gain, knowledge, of, the, theorem, by, inquiry, yet, we, do, know, some, theorems, the, innate, knowledge, thesis, offers, a, solution, to, this, paradox, by, claiming, that, knowledge, is, already, with, us, either, consciously, or, unconsciously, a, rationalist, claims, we, don, t, really, learn, things, in, the, traditional, usage, of, the, word, but, rather, that, we, simply, use, words, we, know, we, have, some, of, the, concepts, we, employ, in, a, particular, subject, area, s, as, part, of, our, rational, nature, similar, to, the, innate, knowledge, thesis, the, innate, concept, thesis, suggests, that, some, concepts, are, simply, part, of, our, rational, nature, these, concepts, are, a, priori, in, nature, and, sense, experience, is, irrelevant, to, determining, the, nature, of, these, concepts, though, sense, experience, can, help, bring, the, concepts, to, our, conscious, mind, in, his, book, meditations, on, first, philosophy, ren, descartes, postulates, three, classifications, for, our, ideas, when, he, says, among, my, ideas, some, appear, to, be, innate, some, to, be, adventitious, and, others, to, have, been, invented, by, me, my, understanding, of, what, a, thing, is, what, truth, is, and, what, thought, is, seems, to, derive, simply, from, my, own, nature, but, my, hearing, a, noise, as, i, do, now, or, seeing, the, sun, or, feeling, the, fire, comes, from, things, which, are, located, outside, me, or, so, i, have, hitherto, judged, lastly, sirens, hippogriffs, and, the, like, are, my, own, invention, adventitious, ideas, are, those, concepts, that, we, gain, through, sense, experiences, ideas, such, as, the, sensation, of, heat, because, they, originate, from, outside, sources, transmitting, their, own, likeness, rather, than, something, else, and, something, you, simply, cannot, will, away, ideas, invented, by, us, such, as, those, found, in, mythology, legends, and, fairy, tales, are, created, by, us, from, other, ideas, we, possess, lastly, innate, ideas, such, as, our, ideas, of, perfection, are, those, ideas, we, have, as, a, result, of, mental, processes, that, are, beyond, what, experience, can, directly, or, indirectly, provide, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, defends, the, idea, of, innate, concepts, by, suggesting, the, mind, plays, a, role, in, determining, the, nature, of, concepts, to, explain, this, he, likens, the, mind, to, a, block, of, marble, in, the, new, essays, on, human, understanding, this, is, why, i, have, taken, as, an, illustration, a, block, of, veined, marble, rather, than, a, wholly, uniform, block, or, blank, tablets, that, is, to, say, what, is, called, tabula, rasa, in, the, language, of, the, philosophers, for, if, the, soul, were, like, those, blank, tablets, truths, would, be, in, us, in, the, same, way, as, the, figure, of, hercules, is, in, a, block, of, marble, when, the, marble, is, completely, indifferent, whether, it, receives, this, or, some, other, figure, but, if, there, were, veins, in, the, stone, which, marked, out, the, figure, of, hercules, rather, than, other, figures, this, stone, would, be, more, determined, thereto, and, hercules, would, be, as, it, were, in, some, manner, innate, in, it, although, labour, would, be, needed, to, uncover, the, veins, and, to, clear, them, by, polishing, and, by, cutting, away, what, prevents, them, from, appearing, it, is, in, this, way, that, ideas, and, truths, are, innate, in, us, like, natural, inclinations, and, dispositions, natural, habits, or, potentialities, and, not, like, activities, although, these, potentialities, are, always, accompanied, by, some, activities, which, correspond, to, them, though, they, are, often, imperceptible, some, philosophers, such, as, john, locke, who, is, considered, one, of, the, most, influential, thinkers, of, the, enlightenment, and, an, empiricist, argue, that, the, innate, knowledge, thesis, and, the, innate, concept, thesis, are, the, same, other, philosophers, such, as, peter, carruthers, argue, that, the, two, theses, are, distinct, from, one, another, as, with, the, other, theses, covered, under, the, umbrella, of, rationalism, the, more, types, and, greater, number, of, concepts, a, philosopher, claims, to, be, innate, the, more, controversial, and, radical, their, position, the, more, a, concept, seems, removed, from, experience, and, the, mental, operations, we, can, perform, on, experience, the, more, plausibly, it, may, be, claimed, to, be, innate, since, we, do, not, experience, perfect, triangles, but, do, experience, pains, our, concept, of, the, former, is, a, more, promising, candidate, for, being, innate, than, our, concept, of, the, latter, although, rationalism, in, its, modern, form, post, dates, antiquity, philosophers, from, this, time, laid, down, the, foundations, of, rationalism, in, particular, the, understanding, that, we, may, be, aware, of, knowledge, available, only, through, the, use, of, rational, thought, pythagoras, was, one, of, the, first, western, philosophers, to, stress, rationalist, insight, he, is, often, revered, as, a, great, mathematician, mystic, and, scientist, but, he, is, best, known, for, the, pythagorean, theorem, which, bears, his, name, and, for, discovering, the, mathematical, relationship, between, the, length, of, strings, on, lute, and, the, pitches, of, the, notes, pythagoras, believed, these, harmonies, reflected, the, ultimate, nature, of, reality, he, summed, up, the, implied, metaphysical, rationalism, in, the, words, all, is, number, it, is, probable, that, he, had, caught, the, rationalist, s, vision, later, seen, by, galileo, 1564, 1642, of, a, world, governed, throughout, by, mathematically, formulable, laws, it, has, been, said, that, he, was, the, first, man, to, call, himself, a, philosopher, or, lover, of, wisdom, plato, held, rational, insight, to, a, very, high, standard, as, is, seen, in, his, works, such, as, meno, and, the, republic, he, taught, on, the, theory, of, forms, or, the, theory, of, ideas, which, asserts, that, the, highest, and, most, fundamental, kind, of, reality, is, not, the, material, world, of, change, known, to, us, through, sensation, but, rather, the, abstract, non, material, but, substantial, world, of, forms, or, ideas, for, plato, these, forms, were, accessible, only, to, reason, and, not, to, sense, in, fact, it, is, said, that, plato, admired, reason, especially, in, geometry, so, highly, that, he, had, the, phrase, let, no, one, ignorant, of, geometry, enter, inscribed, over, the, door, to, his, academy, aristotle, s, main, contribution, to, rationalist, thinking, was, the, use, of, syllogistic, logic, and, its, use, in, argument, aristotle, defines, syllogism, as, a, discourse, in, which, certain, specific, things, having, been, supposed, something, different, from, the, things, supposed, results, of, necessity, because, these, things, are, so, despite, this, very, general, definition, aristotle, limits, himself, to, categorical, syllogisms, which, consist, of, three, categorical, propositions, in, his, work, prior, analytics, these, included, categorical, modal, syllogisms, although, the, three, great, greek, philosophers, disagreed, with, one, another, on, specific, points, they, all, agreed, that, rational, thought, could, bring, to, light, knowledge, that, was, self, evident, information, that, humans, otherwise, could, not, know, without, the, use, of, reason, after, aristotle, s, death, western, rationalistic, thought, was, generally, characterized, by, its, application, to, theology, such, as, in, the, works, of, augustine, the, islamic, philosopher, avicenna, ibn, sina, averroes, ibn, rushd, and, jewish, philosopher, and, theologian, maimonides, the, waldensians, sect, also, incorporated, rationalism, into, their, movement, one, notable, event, in, the, western, timeline, was, the, philosophy, of, thomas, aquinas, who, attempted, to, merge, greek, rationalism, and, christian, revelation, in, the, thirteenth, century, generally, the, roman, catholic, church, viewed, rationalists, as, a, threat, labeling, them, as, those, who, while, admitting, revelation, reject, from, the, word, of, god, whatever, in, their, private, judgment, is, inconsistent, with, human, reason, descartes, was, the, first, of, the, modern, rationalists, and, has, been, dubbed, the, father, of, modern, philosophy, much, subsequent, western, philosophy, is, a, response, to, his, writings, which, are, studied, closely, to, this, day, descartes, thought, that, only, knowledge, of, eternal, truths, including, the, truths, of, mathematics, and, the, epistemological, and, metaphysical, foundations, of, the, sciences, could, be, attained, by, reason, alone, other, knowledge, the, knowledge, of, physics, required, experience, of, the, world, aided, by, the, scientific, method, he, also, argued, that, although, dreams, appear, as, real, as, sense, experience, these, dreams, cannot, provide, persons, with, knowledge, also, since, conscious, sense, experience, can, be, the, cause, of, illusions, then, sense, experience, itself, can, be, doubtable, as, a, result, descartes, deduced, that, a, rational, pursuit, of, truth, should, doubt, every, belief, about, sensory, reality, he, elaborated, these, beliefs, in, such, works, as, discourse, on, the, method, meditations, on, first, philosophy, and, principles, of, philosophy, descartes, developed, a, method, to, attain, truths, according, to, which, nothing, that, cannot, be, recognised, by, the, intellect, or, reason, can, be, classified, as, knowledge, these, truths, are, gained, without, any, sensory, experience, according, to, descartes, truths, that, are, attained, by, reason, are, broken, down, into, elements, that, intuition, can, grasp, which, through, a, purely, deductive, process, will, result, in, clear, truths, about, reality, descartes, therefore, argued, as, a, result, of, his, method, that, reason, alone, determined, knowledge, and, that, this, could, be, done, independently, of, the, senses, for, instance, his, famous, dictum, cogito, ergo, sum, or, i, think, therefore, i, am, is, a, conclusion, reached, a, priori, i, e, prior, to, any, kind, of, experience, on, the, matter, the, simple, meaning, is, that, doubting, one, s, existence, in, and, of, itself, proves, that, an, i, exists, to, do, the, thinking, in, other, words, doubting, one, s, own, doubting, is, absurd, this, was, for, descartes, an, irrefutable, principle, upon, which, to, ground, all, forms, of, other, knowledge, descartes, posited, a, metaphysical, dualism, distinguishing, between, the, substances, of, the, human, body, res, extensa, and, the, mind, or, soul, res, cogitans, this, crucial, distinction, would, be, left, unresolved, and, lead, to, what, is, known, as, the, mind, body, problem, since, the, two, substances, in, the, cartesian, system, are, independent, of, each, other, and, irreducible, the, philosophy, of, baruch, spinoza, is, a, systematic, logical, rational, philosophy, developed, in, seventeenth, century, europe, spinoza, s, philosophy, is, a, system, of, ideas, constructed, upon, basic, building, blocks, with, an, internal, consistency, with, which, he, tried, to, answer, life, s, major, questions, and, in, which, he, proposed, that, god, exists, only, philosophically, he, was, heavily, influenced, by, descartes, euclid, and, thomas, hobbes, as, well, as, theologians, in, the, jewish, philosophical, tradition, such, as, maimonides, but, his, work, was, in, many, respects, a, departure, from, the, judeo, christian, tradition, many, of, spinoza, s, ideas, continue, to, vex, thinkers, today, and, many, of, his, principles, particularly, regarding, the, emotions, have, implications, for, modern, approaches, to, psychology, to, this, day, many, important, thinkers, have, found, spinoza, s, geometrical, method, difficult, to, comprehend, goethe, admitted, that, he, found, this, concept, confusing, his, magnum, opus, ethics, contains, unresolved, obscurities, and, has, a, forbidding, mathematical, structure, modeled, on, euclid, s, geometry, spinoza, s, philosophy, attracted, believers, such, as, albert, einstein, and, much, intellectual, attention, leibniz, was, the, last, major, figure, of, seventeenth, century, rationalism, who, contributed, heavily, to, other, fields, such, as, metaphysics, epistemology, logic, mathematics, physics, jurisprudence, and, the, philosophy, of, religion, he, is, also, considered, to, be, one, of, the, last, universal, geniuses, he, did, not, develop, his, system, however, independently, of, these, advances, leibniz, rejected, cartesian, dualism, and, denied, the, existence, of, a, material, world, in, leibniz, s, view, there, are, infinitely, many, simple, substances, which, he, called, monads, which, he, derived, directly, from, proclus, leibniz, developed, his, theory, of, monads, in, response, to, both, descartes, and, spinoza, because, the, rejection, of, their, visions, forced, him, to, arrive, at, his, own, solution, monads, are, the, fundamental, unit, of, reality, according, to, leibniz, constituting, both, inanimate, and, animate, objects, these, units, of, reality, represent, the, universe, though, they, are, not, subject, to, the, laws, of, causality, or, space, which, he, called, well, founded, phenomena, leibniz, therefore, introduced, his, principle, of, pre, established, harmony, to, account, for, apparent, causality, in, the, world, kant, is, one, of, the, central, figures, of, modern, philosophy, and, set, the, terms, by, which, all, subsequent, thinkers, have, had, to, grapple, he, argued, that, human, perception, structures, natural, laws, and, that, reason, is, the, source, of, morality, his, thought, continues, to, hold, a, major, influence, in, contemporary, thought, especially, in, fields, such, as, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political, philosophy, and, aesthetics, kant, named, his, brand, of, epistemology, transcendental, idealism, and, he, first, laid, out, these, views, in, his, famous, work, the, critique, of, pure, reason, in, it, he, argued, that, there, were, fundamental, problems, with, both, rationalist, and, empiricist, dogma, to, the, rationalists, he, argued, broadly, that, pure, reason, is, flawed, when, it, goes, beyond, its, limits, and, claims, to, know, those, things, that, are, necessarily, beyond, the, realm, of, every, possible, experience, the, existence, of, god, free, will, and, the, immortality, of, the, human, soul, kant, referred, to, these, objects, as, the, thing, in, itself, and, goes, on, to, argue, that, their, status, as, objects, beyond, all, possible, experience, by, definition, means, we, cannot, know, them, to, the, empiricist, he, argued, that, while, it, is, correct, that, experience, is, fundamentally, necessary, for, human, knowledge, reason, is, necessary, for, processing, that, experience, into, coherent, thought, he, therefore, concludes, that, both, reason, and, experience, are, necessary, for, human, knowledge, in, the, same, way, kant, also, argued, that, it, was, wrong, to, regard, thought, as, mere, analysis, in, kant, s, views, a, priori, concepts, do, exist, but, if, they, are, to, lead, to, the, amplification, of, knowledge, they, must, be, brought, into, relation, with, empirical, data, rationalism, has, become, a, rarer, label, of, philosophers, today, rather, many, different, kinds, of, specialised, rationalisms, are, identified, for, example, robert, brandom, has, appropriated, the, terms, rationalist, expressivism, and, rationalist, pragmatism, as, labels, for, aspects, of, his, programme, in, articulating, reasons, and, identified, linguistic, rationalism, the, claim, that, the, contents, of, propositions, are, essentially, what, can, serve, as, both, premises, and, conclusions, of, inferences, as, a, key, thesis, of, wilfred, sellars, outside, of, academic, philosophy, some, participants, in, the, internet, communities, surrounding, lesswrong, and, slate, star, codex, have, described, themselves, as, rationalists, the, term, has, also, been, used, in, this, way, by, critics, such, as, timnit, gebru, rationalism, was, criticized, by, american, psychologist, william, james, for, being, out, of, touch, with, reality, james, also, criticized, rationalism, for, representing, the, universe, as, a, closed, system, which, contrasts, with, his, view, that, the, universe, is, an, open, system, proponents, of, emotional, choice, theory, criticize, rationalism, by, drawing, on, new, findings, from, emotion, research, in, psychology, and, neuroscience, they, point, out, that, the, rationalist, paradigm, is, generally, based, on, the, assumption, that, decision, making, is, a, conscious, and, reflective, process, based, on, thoughts, and, beliefs, it, presumes, that, people, decide, on, the, basis, of, calculation, and, deliberation, however, cumulative, research, in, neuroscience, suggests, that, only, a, small, part, of, the, brain, s, activities, operate, at, the, level, of, conscious, reflection, the, vast, majority, of, its, activities, consist, of, unconscious, appraisals, and, emotions, the, significance, of, emotions, in, decision, making, has, generally, been, ignored, by, rationalism, according, to, these, critics, moreover, emotional, choice, theorists, contend, that, the, rationalist, paradigm, has, difficulty, incorporating, emotions, into, its, models, because, it, cannot, account, for, the, social, nature, of, emotions, even, though, emotions, are, felt, by, individuals, psychologists, and, sociologists, have, shown, that, emotions, cannot, be, isolated, from, the, social, environment, in, which, they, arise, emotions, are, inextricably, intertwined, with, people, s, social, norms, and, identities, which, are, typically, outside, the, scope, of, standard, rationalist, accounts, emotional, choice, theory, seeks, to, capture, not, only, the, social, but, also, the, physiological, and, dynamic, character, of, emotions, it, represents, a, unitary, action, model, to, organize, explain, and, predict, the, ways, in, which, emotions, shape, decision, making
