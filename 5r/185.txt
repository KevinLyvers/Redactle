texts, and, some, texts, were, always, treated, as, more, authoritative, than, others, scribes, preserved, and, changed, the, texts, by, changing, the, script, and, updating, archaic, forms, while, also, making, corrections, these, hebrew, texts, were, copied, with, great, care, considered, to, be, scriptures, sacred, authoritative, religious, texts, the, books, were, compiled, by, different, religious, communities, into, various, biblical, canons, official, collections, of, scriptures, the, earliest, compilation, containing, the, first, five, books, of, the, bible, and, called, the,

histories, was, canonized, sometime, between, the, second, century, bce, and, the, second, century, ce, these, three, collections, were, written, mostly, in, biblical, hebrew, with, some, parts, in, aramaic, which, together, form, the, hebrew, bible, or, tanakh, an, abbreviation, of, torah, nevi, im, and, ketuvim, there, are, three, major, historical, versions, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, septuagint, the, masoretic, text, and, the, samaritan, pentateuch, which, contains, only, the, first, five, books, they, are, related, but, do, not, share, the, same, paths, of, development, the, septuagint, or, the, lxx, is, a, translation, of, the, hebrew, scriptures, and, some, related, texts, into, koine, greek, and, is, believed, to, have, been, carried, out, by, approximately, seventy, or, seventy, two, scribes, and, elders, who, were, hellenic, jews, begun, in, alexandria, in, the, late, third, century, bce, and, completed, by, 132, bce, probably, commissioned, by, ptolemy, ii,

septuagint, were, found, among, the, dead, sea, scrolls, portions, of, its, text, are, also, found, on, existing, papyrus, from, egypt, dating, to, the, second, and, first, centuries, bce, and, to, the, first, century, ce, 5, the, masoretes, began, developing, what, would, become, the, authoritative, hebrew, and, aramaic, text, of, the, 24, books, of, the, hebrew, bible, in, rabbinic, judaism, near, the, end, of, the, talmudic, period, c, 300, c, 500, ce, but, the, actual, date, is, difficult, to, determine, in, the, sixth, and, seventh, centuries, three, jewish, communities, contributed, systems, for, writing, the, precise, letter, text, with, its, vocalization, and, accentuation, known, as, the, mas, sora, from, which, we, derive, the, term, masoretic, these, early, masoretic, scholars, were, based, primarily, in, the, galilean, cities, of, tiberias, and, jerusalem, and, in, babylonia, modern, iraq, those, living, in, the, jewish, community, of, tiberias, in, ancient, galilee, c, 750, 950, made, scribal, copies, of, the, hebrew, bible, texts, without, a, standard, text, such, as, the, babylonian, tradition, had, to, work, from, the, canonical, pronunciation, of, the, hebrew, bible, called, tiberian, hebrew, that, they, developed, and, many, of, the, notes, they, made, therefore, differed, from, the, babylonian, these, differences, were, resolved, into, a, standard, text, called, the, masoretic, text, in, the, ninth, century, the, oldest, complete, copy, still, in, existence, is, the, leningrad, codex, dating, to, c, 1000, ce, the, samaritan, pentateuch, is, a, version, of, the, torah, maintained, by, the, samaritan, community, since, antiquity, which, was, rediscovered, by, european, scholars, in, the, 17th, century, its, oldest, existing, copies, date, to, c, 1100, ce, samaritans, include, only, the, pentateuch, torah, in, their, biblical, canon, they, do, not, recognize, divine, authorship, or, inspiration, in, any, other, book, in, the, jewish, tanakh, a, samaritan, book, of, joshua, partly, based, upon, the, tanakh, s, book, of, joshua, exists, but, samaritans, regard, it, as, a, non, canonical, secular, historical, chronicle, in, the, seventh, century, the, first, codex, form, of, the, hebrew, bible, was, produced, the, codex, is, the, forerunner, of, the, modern, book, popularized, by, early, christians, it, was, made, by, folding, a, single, sheet, of, papyrus, in, half, forming, pages, assembling, multiples, of, these, folded, pages, together, created, a, book, that, was, more, easily, accessible, and, more, portable, than, scrolls, in, 1488, the, first, complete, printed, press, version, of, the, hebrew, bible, was, produced, during, the, rise, of, christianity, in, the, first, century, ce, new, scriptures, were, written, in, koine, greek, christians, eventually, called, these, new, scriptures, the, new, testament, and, began, referring, to, the, septuagint, as, the, old, testament, the, new, testament, has, been, preserved, in, more, manuscripts, than, any, other, ancient, work, most, early, christian, copyists, were, not, trained, scribes, many, copies, of, the, gospels, and, paul, s, letters, were, made, by, individual, christians, over, a, relatively, short, period, of, time, very, soon, after, the, originals, were, written, there, is, evidence, in, the, synoptic, gospels, in, the, writings, of, the, early, church, fathers, from, marcion, and, in, the, didache, that, christian, documents, were, in, circulation, before, the, end, of, the, first, century, paul, s, letters, were, circulated, during, his, lifetime, and, his, death, is, thought, to, have, occurred, before, 68, during, nero, s, reign, early, christians, transported, these, writings, around, the, empire, translating, them, into, old, syriac, coptic, ethiopic, and, latin, and, other, languages, bart, ehrman, explains, how, these, multiple, texts, later, became, grouped, by, scholars, into, categories, during, the, early, centuries, of, the, church, christian, texts, were, copied, in, whatever, location, they, were, written, or, taken, to, since, texts, were, copied, locally, it, is, no, surprise, that, different, localities, developed, different, kinds, of, textual, tradition, that, is, to, say, the, manuscripts, in, rome, had, many, of, the, same, errors, because, they, were, for, the, most, part, in, house, documents, copied, from, one, another, they, were, not, influenced, much, by, manuscripts, being, copied, in, palestine, and, those, in, palestine, took, on, their, own, characteristics, which, were, not, the, same, as, those, found, in, a, place, like, alexandria, egypt, moreover, in, the, early, centuries, of, the, church, some, locales, had, better, scribes, than, others, modern, scholars, have, come, to, recognize, that, the, scribes, in, alexandria, which, was, a, major, intellectual, center, in, the, ancient, world, were, particularly, scrupulous, even, in, these, early, centuries, and, that, there, in, alexandria, a, very, pure, form, of, the, text, of, the, early, christian, writings, was, preserved, decade, after, decade, by, dedicated, and, relatively, skilled, christian, scribes, these, differing, histories, produced, what, modern, scholars, refer, to, as, recognizable, text, types, the, four, most, commonly, recognized, are, alexandrian, western, caesarean, and, byzantine, the, list, of, books, included, in, the, catholic, bible, was, established, as, canon, by, the, council, of, rome, in, 382, followed, by, those, of, hippo, in, 393, and, carthage, in, 397, between, 385, and, 405, ce, the, early, christian, church, translated, its, canon, into, vulgar, latin, the, common, latin, spoken, by, ordinary, people, a, translation, known, as, the, vulgate, since, then, catholic, christians, have, held, ecumenical, councils, to, standardize, their, biblical, canon, the, council, of, trent, 1545, 63, held, by, the, catholic, church, in, response, to, the, protestant, reformation, authorized, the, vulgate, as, its, official, latin, translation, of, the, bible, a, number, of, biblical, canons, have, since, evolved, christian, biblical, canons, range, from, the, 73, books, of, the, catholic, church, canon, and, the, 66, book, canon, of, most, protestant, denominations, to, the, 81, books, of, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, canon, among, others, judaism, has, long, accepted, a, single, authoritative, text, whereas, christianity, has, never, had, an, official, version, instead, having, many, different, manuscript, traditions, all, biblical, texts, were, treated, with, reverence, and, care, by, those, that, copied, them, yet, there, are, transmission, errors, called, variants, in, all, biblical, manuscripts, a, variant, is, any, deviation, between, two, texts, textual, critic, daniel, b, wallace, explains, that, each, deviation, counts, as, one, variant, regardless, of, how, many, mss, attest, to, it, hebrew, scholar, emanuel, tov, says, the, term, is, not, evaluative, it, is, a, recognition, that, the, paths, of, development, of, different, texts, have, separated, medieval, handwritten, manuscripts, of, the, hebrew, bible, were, considered, extremely, precise, the, most, authoritative, documents, from, which, to, copy, other, texts, even, so, david, carr, asserts, that, hebrew, texts, still, contain, some, variants, the, majority, of, all, variants, are, accidental, such, as, spelling, errors, but, some, changes, were, intentional, in, the, hebrew, text, memory, variants, are, generally, accidental, differences, evidenced, by, such, things, as, the, shift, in, word, order, found, in, 1, chronicles, 17, 24, and, 2, samuel, 10, 9, and, 13, variants, also, include, the, substitution, of, lexical, equivalents, semantic, and, grammar, differences, and, larger, scale, shifts, in, order, with, some, major, revisions, of, the, masoretic, texts, that, must, have, been, intentional, intentional, changes, in, new, testament, texts, were, made, to, improve, grammar, eliminate, discrepancies, harmonize, parallel, passages, combine, and, simplify, multiple, variant, readings, into, one, and, for, theological, reasons, bruce, k, waltke, observes, that, one, variant, for, every, ten, words, was, noted, in, the, recent, critical, edition, of, the, hebrew, bible, the, biblia, hebraica, stuttgartensia, leaving, 90, of, the, hebrew, text, without, variation, the, fourth, edition, of, the, united, bible, society, s, greek, new, testament, notes, variants, affecting, about, 500, out, of, 6900, words, or, about, 7, of, the, text, the, narratives, laws, wisdom, sayings, parables, and, unique, genres, of, the, bible, provide, opportunity, for, discussion, on, most, topics, of, concern, to, human, beings, the, role, of, women, 203, sex, children, marriage, neighbours, 24, friends, the, nature, of, authority, and, the, sharing, of, power, 45, 48, animals, trees, and, nature, xi, money, and, economics, 77, work, relationships, sorrow, and, despair, and, the, nature, of, joy, among, others, philosopher, and, ethicist, jaco, gericke, adds, the, meaning, of, good, and, evil, the, nature, of, right, and, wrong, criteria, for, moral, discernment, valid, sources, of, morality, the, origin, and, acquisition, of, moral, beliefs, the, ontological, status, of, moral, norms, moral, authority, cultural, pluralism, axiological, and, aesthetic, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, value, and, beauty, these, are, all, implicit, in, the, texts, however, discerning, the, themes, of, some, biblical, texts, can, be, problematic, much, of, the, bible, is, in, narrative, form, and, in, general, biblical, narrative, refrains, from, any, kind, of, direct, instruction, and, in, some, texts, the, author, s, intent, is, not, easy, to, decipher, it, is, left, to, the, reader, to, determine, good, and, bad, right, and, wrong, and, the, path, to, understanding, and, practice, is, rarely, straightforward, god, is, sometimes, portrayed, as, having, a, role, in, the, plot, but, more, often, there, is, little, about, god, s, reaction, to, events, and, no, mention, at, all, of, approval, or, disapproval, of, what, the, characters, have, done, or, failed, to, do, the, writer, makes, no, comment, and, the, reader, is, left, to, infer, what, they, will, jewish, philosophers, shalom, carmy, and, david, schatz, explain, that, the, bible, often, juxtaposes, contradictory, ideas, without, explanation, or, apology, the, hebrew, bible, contains, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, knowledge, belief, truth, interpretation, understanding, and, cognitive, processes, ethicist, michael, v, fox, writes, that, the, primary, axiom, of, the, book, of, proverbs, is, that, the, exercise, of, the, human, mind, is, the, necessary, and, sufficient, condition, of, right, and, successful, behavior, in, all, reaches, of, life, the, bible, teaches, the, nature, of, valid, arguments, the, nature, and, power, of, language, and, its, relation, to, reality, according, to, mittleman, the, bible, provides, patterns, of, moral, reasoning, that, focus, on, conduct, and, character, in, the, biblical, metaphysic, humans, have, free, will, but, it, is, a, relative, and, restricted, freedom, beach, says, that, christian, voluntarism, points, to, the, will, as, the, core, of, the, self, and, that, within, human, nature, the, core, of, who, we, are, is, defined, by, what, we, love, natural, law, is, in, the, wisdom, literature, the, prophets, romans, 1, acts, 17, and, the, book, of, amos, amos, 1, 3, 2, 5, where, nations, other, than, israel, are, held, accountable, for, their, ethical, decisions, even, though, they, don, t, know, the, hebrew, god, political, theorist, michael, walzer, finds, politics, in, the, hebrew, bible, in, covenant, law, and, prophecy, which, constitute, an, early, form, of, almost, democratic, political, ethics, key, elements, in, biblical, criminal, justice, begin, with, the, belief, in, god, as, the, source, of, justice, and, the, judge, of, all, including, those, administering, justice, on, earth, carmy, and, schatz, say, the, bible, depicts, the, character, of, god, presents, an, account, of, creation, posits, a, metaphysics, of, divine, providence, and, divine, intervention, suggests, a, basis, for, morality, discusses, many, features, of, human, nature, and, frequently, poses, the, notorious, conundrum, of, how, god, can, allow, evil, the, authoritative, hebrew, bible, is, taken, from, the, masoretic, text, called, the, leningrad, codex, which, dates, from, 1008, the, hebrew, bible, can, therefore, sometimes, be, referred, to, as, the, masoretic, text, the, hebrew, bible, is, also, known, by, the, name, tanakh, hebrew, this, reflects, the, threefold, division, of, the, hebrew, scriptures, torah, teaching, nevi, im, prophets, and, ketuvim, writings, by, using, the, first, letters, of, each, word, it, is, not, until, the, babylonian, talmud, c, 550, bce, that, a, listing, of, the, contents, of, these, three, divisions, of,

five, scroll, cases, traditionally, these, books, were, considered, to, have, been, dictated, to, moses, by, god, himself, since, the, 17th, century, scholars, have, viewed, the, original, sources, as, being, the, product, of, multiple, anonymous, authors, while, also, allowing, the, possibility, that, moses, first, assembled, the, separate, sources, there, are, a, variety, of, hypotheses, regarding, when, and, how, the, torah, was, composed, but, there, is, a, general, consensus, that, it, took, its, final, form, during, the, reign, of, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, probably, 450, 350, bce, or, perhaps, in, the, early, hellenistic, period, 333, 164, bce, the, hebrew, names, of, the, books, are, derived, from, the, first, words, in, the, respective, texts, the, torah, consists, of, the, following, five, books, the, first, eleven, chapters, of, genesis, provide, accounts, of, the, creation, or, ordering, of, the, world, and, the, history, of, god, s, early, relationship, with, humanity, the, remaining, thirty, nine, chapters, of, genesis, provide, an, account, of, god, s, covenant, with, the, biblical, patriarchs, abraham, isaac, and, jacob, also, called, israel, and, jacob, s, children, the, children, of, israel, especially, joseph, it, tells, of, how, god, commanded, abraham, to, leave, his, family, and, home, in, the, city, of, ur, eventually, to, settle, in, the, land, of, canaan, and, how, the, children, of, israel, later, moved, to, egypt, the, remaining, four, books, of, the, torah, tell, the, story, of, moses, who, lived, hundreds, of, years, after, the, patriarchs, he, leads, the, children, of, israel, from, slavery, in, ancient, egypt, to, the, renewal, of, their, covenant, with, god, at, mount, sinai, and, their, wanderings, in, the, desert,

tiberian, and, closes, it, in, the, babylonian, the, ketuvim, is, the, last, of, the, three, portions, of, the, tanakh, to, have, been, accepted, as, canonical, while, the, torah, may, have, been, considered, canon, by, israel, as, early, as, the, fifth, century, bce, and, the, former, and, latter, prophets, were, canonized, by, the, second, century, bce, the, ketuvim, was, not, a, fixed, canon, until, the, second, century, ce, evidence, suggests, however, that, the, people, of, israel, were, adding, what, would, become, the, ketuvim, to, their, holy, literature, shortly, after, the, canonization, of, the, prophets, as, early, as, 132, bce, references, suggest, that, the, ketuvim, was, starting, to, take, shape, although, it, lacked, a, formal, title, against, apion, the, writing, of, josephus, in, 95, ce, treated, the, text, of, the, hebrew, bible, as, a, closed, canon, to, which, no, one, has, ventured, either, to, add, or, to, remove, or, to, alter, a, syllable, for, an, extended, period, after, 95ce, the, divine, inspiration, of, esther, the, song, of, songs, and, ecclesiastes, was, often, under, scrutiny, the, septuagint, the, translation, of, the, seventy, also, called, the, lxx, is, a, koine, greek, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, begun, in, the, late, third, century, bce, as, the, work, of, translation, progressed, the, septuagint, expanded, the, collection, of, prophetic, writings, had, various, hagiographical, works, incorporated, into, it, in, addition, some, newer, books, such, as, the, books, of, the, maccabees, and, the, wisdom, of, sirach, were, added, these, are, among, the, apocryphal, books, books, whose, authenticity, is, doubted, the, inclusion, of, these, texts, and, the, claim, of, some, mistranslations, contributed, to, the, septuagint, being, seen, as, a, careless, translation, and, its, eventual, rejection, as, a, valid, jewish, scriptural, text, the, apocrypha, are, jewish, literature, mostly, of, the, second, temple, period, c, 550, bce, 70, ce, they, originated, in, israel, syria, egypt, or, persia, were, originally, written, in, hebrew, aramaic, or, greek, and, attempt, to, tell, of, biblical, characters, and, themes, their, provenance, is, obscure, one, older, theory, of, where, they, came, from, asserted, that, an, alexandrian, canon, had, been, accepted, among, the, greek, speaking, jews, living, there, but, that, theory, has, since, been, abandoned, indications, are, that, they, were, not, accepted, when, the, rest, of, the, hebrew, canon, was, it, is, clear, the, apocrypha, were, used, in, new, testament, times, but, they, are, never, quoted, as, scripture, in, modern, judaism, none, of, the, apocryphal, books, are, accepted, as, authentic, and, are, therefore, excluded, from, the, canon, however, the, ethiopian, jews, who, are, sometimes, called, falashas, have, an, expanded, canon, which, includes, some, apocryphal, books, the, rabbis, also, wanted, to, distinguish, their, tradition, from, the, newly, emerging, tradition, of, christianity, finally, the, rabbis, claimed, a, divine, authority, for, the, hebrew, language, in, contrast, to, aramaic, or, greek, even, though, these, languages, were, the, lingua, franca, of, jews, during, this, period, and, aramaic, would, eventually, be, given, the, status, of, a, sacred, language, comparable, to, hebrew, the, book, of, daniel, is, preserved, in, the, 12, chapter, masoretic, text, and, in, two, longer, greek, versions, the, original, septuagint, version, c, 100, bce, and, the, later, theodotion, version, from, c, second, century, ce, both, greek, texts, contain, three, additions, to, daniel, the, prayer, of, azariah, and, song, of, the, three, holy, children, the, story, of, susannah, and, the, elders, and, the, story, of, bel, and, the, dragon, theodotion, s, translation, was, so, widely, copied, in, the, early, christian, church, that, its, version, of, the, book, of, daniel, virtually, superseded, the, septuagint, s, the, priest, jerome, in, his, preface, to, daniel, 407, ce, records, the, rejection, of, the, septuagint, version, of, that, book, in, christian, usage, i, wish, to, emphasize, to, the, reader, the, fact, that, it, was, not, according, to, the, septuagint, version, but, according, to, the, version, of, theodotion, himself, that, the, churches, publicly, read, daniel, jerome, s, preface, also, mentions, that, the, hexapla, had, notations, in, it, indicating, several, major, differences, in, content, between, the, theodotion, daniel, and, the, earlier, versions, in, greek, and, hebrew, theodotion, s, daniel, is, closer, to, the, surviving, hebrew, masoretic, text, version, the, text, which, is, the, basis, for, most, modern, translations, theodotion, s, daniel, is, also, the, one, embodied, in, the, authorized, edition, of, the, septuagint, published, by, sixtus, v, in, 1587, textual, critics, are, now, debating, how, to, reconcile, the, earlier, view, of, the, septuagint, as, careless, with, content, from, the, dead, sea, scrolls, at, qumran, scrolls, discovered, at, wadi, murabba, at, nahal, hever, and, those, discovered, at, masada, these, scrolls, are, 1000, 1300, years, older, than, the, leningrad, text, dated, to, 1008, ce, which, forms, the, basis, of, the, masoretic, text, the, scrolls, have, confirmed, much, of, the, masoretic, text, but, they, have, also, differed, from, it, and, many, of, those, differences, agree, with, the, septuagint, the, samaritan, pentateuch, or, the, greek, old, testament, instead, copies, of, some, texts, later, declared, apocryphal, are, also, among, the, qumran, texts, ancient, manuscripts, of, the, book, of, sirach, the, psalms, of, joshua, tobit, and, the, epistle, of, jeremiah, are, now, known, to, have, existed, in, a, hebrew, version, the, septuagint, version, of, some, biblical, books, such, as, the, book, of, daniel, and, book, of, esther, are, longer, than, those, in, the, jewish, canon, in, the, septuagint, jeremiah, is, shorter, than, in, the, masoretic, text, but, a, shortened, hebrew, jeremiah, has, been, found, at, qumran, in, cave, 4, the, scrolls, of, isaiah, exodus, jeremiah, daniel, and, samuel, exhibit, striking, and, important, textual, variants, from, the, masoretic, text, the, septuagint, is, now, seen, as, a, careful, translation, of, a, different, hebrew, form, or, recension, revised, addition, of, the, text, of, certain, books, but, debate, on, how, best, to, characterize, these, varied, texts, is, ongoing, pseudepigrapha, are, works, whose, authorship, is, wrongly, attributed, a, written, work, can, be, pseudepigraphical, and, not, be, a, forgery, as, forgeries, are, intentionally, deceptive, with, pseudepigrapha, authorship, has, been, mistransmitted, for, any, one, of, a, number, of, reasons, for, example, the, gospel, of, barnabas, claims, to, be, written, by, barnabas, the, companion, of, the, apostle, paul, but, both, its, manuscripts, date, from, the, middle, ages, apocryphal, and, pseudepigraphic, works, are, not, the, same, apocrypha, includes, all, the, writings, claiming, to, be, sacred, that, are, outside, the, canon, because, they, are, not, accepted, as, authentically, being, what, they, claim, to, be, pseudepigrapha, is, a, literary, category, of, all, writings, whether, they, are, canonical, or, apocryphal, they, may, or, may, not, be, authentic, in, every, sense, except, a, misunderstood, authorship, the, term, pseudepigrapha, is, commonly, used, to, describe, numerous, works, of, jewish, religious, literature, written, from, about, 300, bce, to, 300, ce, not, all, of, these, works, are, actually, pseudepigraphical, it, also, refers, to, books, of, the, new, testament, canon, whose, authorship, is, questioned, the, old, testament, pseudepigraphal, works, include, the, following, notable, pseudepigraphal, works, include, the, books, of, enoch, such, as, 1, enoch, 2, enoch, which, survives, only, in, old, slavonic, and, 3, enoch, surviving, in, hebrew, of, the, c, fifth, century, c, sixth, century, ce, these, are, ancient, jewish, religious, works, traditionally, ascribed, to, the, prophet, enoch, the, great, grandfather, of, the, patriarch, noah, the, fragment, of, enoch, found, among, the, qumran, scrolls, attest, to, it, being, an, ancient, work, the, older, sections, mainly, in, the, book, of, the, watchers, are, estimated, to, date, from, about, 300, bce, and, the, latest, part, book, of, parables, was, probably, composed, at, the, end, of, the, first, century, bce, enoch, is, not, part, of, the, biblical, canon, used, by, most, jews, apart, from, beta, israel, most, christian, denominations, and, traditions, may, accept, the, books, of, enoch, as, having, some, historical, or, theological, interest, or, significance, part, of, the, book, of, enoch, is, quoted, in, the, epistle, of, jude, and, the, book, of, hebrews, parts, of, the, new, testament, but, christian, denominations, generally, regard, the, books, of, enoch, as, non, canonical, the, exceptions, to, this, view, are, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, and, eritrean, orthodox, tewahedo, church, the, ethiopian, bible, is, not, based, on, the, greek, bible, and, the, ethiopian, church, has, a, slightly, different, understanding, of, canon, than, other, christian, traditions, in, ethiopia, canon, does, not, have, the, same, degree, of, fixedness, yet, neither, is, it, completely, open, enoch, has, long, been, seen, there, as, inspired, scripture, but, being, scriptural, and, being, canon, are, not, always, seen, the, same, the, official, ethiopian, canon, has, 81, books, but, that, number, is, reached, in, different, ways, with, various, lists, of, different, books, and, the, book, of, enoch, is, sometimes, included, and, sometimes, not, current, evidence, confirms, enoch, as, canonical, in, both, ethiopia, and, in, eritrea, a, christian, bible, is, a, set, of, books, divided, into, the, old, and, new, testament, that, a, christian, denomination, has, at, some, point, in, their, past, or, present, regarded, as, divinely, inspired, scripture, by, the, holy, spirit, the, early, church, primarily, used, the, septuagint, as, it, was, written, in, greek, the, common, tongue, of, the, day, or, they, used, the, targums, among, aramaic, speakers, modern, english, translations, of, the, old, testament, section, of, the, christian, bible, are, based, on, the, masoretic, text, the, pauline, epistles, and, the, gospels, were, soon, added, along, with, other, writings, as, the, new, testament, the, old, testament, has, been, important, to, the, life, of, the, christian, church, from, its, earliest, days, bible, scholar, n, t, wright, says, jesus, himself, was, profoundly, shaped, by, the, scriptures, wright, adds, that, the, earliest, christians, searched, those, same, hebrew, scriptures, in, their, effort, to, understand, the, earthly, life, of, jesus, they, regarded, the, holy, writings, of, the, israelites, as, necessary, and, instructive, for, the, christian, as, seen, from, paul, s, words, to, timothy, 2, timothy, 3, 15, as, pointing, to, the, messiah, and, as, having, reached, a, climactic, fulfilment, in, jesus, generating, the, new, covenant, prophesied, by, jeremiah, the, protestant, old, testament, of, the, 21st, century, has, a, 39, book, canon, the, number, of, books, although, not, the, content, varies, from, the, jewish, tanakh, only, because, of, a, different, method, of, division, the, term, hebrew, scriptures, is, often, used, as, being, synonymous, with, the, protestant, old, testament, since, the, surviving, scriptures, in, hebrew, include, only, those, books, however, the, roman, catholic, church, recognizes, 46, books, as, its, old, testament, 45, if, jeremiah, and, lamentations, are, counted, as, one, and, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, recognize, 6, additional, books, these, additions, are, also, included, in, the, syriac, versions, of, the, bible, called, the, peshitta, and, the, ethiopian, bible, because, the, canon, of, scripture, is, distinct, for, jews, eastern, orthodox, roman, catholics, and, western, protestants, the, contents, of, each, community, s, apocrypha, are, unique, as, is, its, usage, of, the, term, for, jews, none, of, the, apocryphal, books, are, considered, canonical, catholics, refer, to, this, collection, as, deuterocanonical, books, second, canon, and, the, orthodox, church, refers, to, them, as, anagignoskomena, that, which, is, read, books, included, in, the, catholic, orthodox, greek, and, slavonic, bibles, are, tobit, judith, the, wisdom, of, solomon, sirach, or, ecclesiasticus, baruch, the, letter, of, jeremiah, also, called, the, baruch, chapter, 6, 1, maccabees, 2, maccabees, the, greek, additions, to, esther, and, the, greek, additions, to, daniel, the, greek, orthodox, church, and, the, slavonic, churches, belarus, bosnia, and, herzegovina, bulgaria, north, macedonia, montenegro, poland, ukraine, russia, serbia, the, czech, republic, slovakia, slovenia, and, croatia, also, add, 2, esdras, 4, esdras, which, is, not, included, in, the, septuagint, does, not, exist, in, greek, though, it, does, exist, in, latin, there, is, also, 4, maccabees, which, is, only, accepted, as, canonical, in, the, georgian, church, it, is, in, an, appendix, to, the, greek, orthodox, bible, and, it, is, therefore, sometimes, included, in, collections, of, the, apocrypha, the, syriac, orthodox, church, also, includes, the, ethiopian, old, testament, canon, uses, enoch, and, jubilees, that, only, survived, in, ge, ez, 1, 3, meqabyan, greek, ezra, 2, esdras, and, psalm, 151, the, revised, common, lectionary, of, the, lutheran, church, moravian, church, reformed, churches, anglican, church, and, methodist, church, uses, the, apocryphal, books, liturgically, with, alternative, old, testament, readings, available, therefore, editions, of, the, bible, intended, for, use, in, the, lutheran, church, and, anglican, church, include, the, fourteen, books, of, the, apocrypha, many, of, which, are, the, deuterocanonical, books, accepted, by, the, catholic, church, plus, 1, esdras, 2, esdras, and, the, prayer, of, manasseh, which, were, in, the, vulgate, appendix, the, roman, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, churches, use, most, of, the, books, of, the, septuagint, while, protestant, churches, usually, do, not, after, the, protestant, reformation, many, protestant, bibles, began, to, follow, the, jewish, canon, and, exclude, the, additional, texts, which, came, to, be, called, apocryphal, the, apocrypha, are, included, under, a, separate, heading, in, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, the, basis, for, the, revised, standard, version, the, new, testament, is, the, name, given, to, the, second, portion, of, the, christian, bible, while, some, scholars, assert, that, aramaic, was, the, original, language, of, the, new, testament, the, majority, view, says, it, was, written, in, the, vernacular, form, of, koine, greek, still, there, is, reason, to, assert, that, it, is, a, heavily, semitized, greek, its, syntax, is, like, conversational, greek, but, its, style, is, largely, semitic, koine, greek, was, the, common, language, of, the, western, roman, empire, from, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, 335, 323, bce, until, the, evolution, of, byzantine, greek, c, 600, while, aramaic, was, the, language, of, jesus, the, apostles, and, the, ancient, near, east, the, term, new, testament, came, into, use, in, the, second, century, during, a, controversy, over, whether, the, hebrew, bible, should, be, included, with, the, christian, writings, as, sacred, scripture, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, new, testament, writers, were, jews, who, took, the, inspiration, of, the, old, testament, for, granted, this, is, probably, stated, earliest, in, 2, timothy, 3, 16, all, scripture, is, given, by, inspiration, of, god, scholarship, on, how, and, why, ancient, jewish, christians, came, to, create, and, accept, new, texts, as, equal, to, the, established, hebrew, texts, has, taken, three, forms, first, john, barton, writes, that, ancient, christians, probably, just, continued, the, jewish, tradition, of, writing, and, incorporating, what, they, believed, were, inspired, authoritative, religious, books, the, second, approach, separates, those, various, inspired, writings, based, on, a, concept, of, canon, which, developed, in, the, second, century, the, third, involves, formalizing, canon, according, to, barton, these, differences, are, only, differences, in, terminology, the, ideas, are, reconciled, if, they, are, seen, as, three, stages, in, the, formation, of, the, new, testament, the, first, stage, was, completed, remarkably, early, if, one, accepts, albert, c, sundberg, s, view, that, canon, and, scripture, are, separate, things, with, scripture, having, been, recognized, by, ancient, christians, long, before, canon, was, barton, says, theodor, zahn, concluded, there, was, already, a, christian, canon, by, the, end, of, the, first, century, but, this, is, not, the, canon, of, later, centuries, accordingly, sundberg, asserts, that, in, the, first, centuries, there, was, no, criterion, for, inclusion, in, the, sacred, writings, beyond, inspiration, and, that, no, one, in, the, first, century, had, the, idea, of, a, closed, canon, the, gospels, were, accepted, by, early, believers, as, handed, down, from, those, apostles, who, had, known, jesus, and, been, taught, by, him, later, biblical, criticism, has, questioned, the, authorship, and, datings, of, the, gospels, at, the, end, of, the, second, century, it, is, widely, recognized, that, a, christian, canon, similar, to, its, modern, version, was, asserted, by, the, church, fathers, in, response, to, the, plethora, of, writings, claiming, inspiration, that, contradicted, orthodoxy, heresy, the, third, stage, of, development, as, the, final, canon, occurred, in, the, fourth, century, with, a, series, of, synods, that, produced, a, list, of, texts, of, the, canon, of, the, old, testament, and, the, new, testament, that, are, still, used, today, most, notably, the, synod, of, hippo, in, 393, ce, and, that, of, c, 400, jerome, produced, a, definitive, latin, edition, of, the, bible, the, vulgate, the, canon, of, which, at, the, insistence, of, the, pope, was, in, accord, with, the, earlier, synods, this, process, effectively, set, the, new, testament, canon, new, testament, books, already, had, considerable, authority, in, the, late, first, and, early, second, centuries, even, in, its, formative, period, most, of, the, books, of, the, nt, that, were, seen, as, scripture, were, already, agreed, upon, linguistics, scholar, stanley, e, porter, says, evidence, from, the, apocryphal, non, gospel, literature, is, the, same, as, that, for, the, apocryphal, gospels, in, other, words, that, the, text, of, the, greek, new, testament, was, relatively, well, established, and, fixed, by, the, time, of, the, second, and, third, centuries, by, the, time, the, fourth, century, fathers, were, approving, the, canon, they, were, doing, little, more, than, codifying, what, was, already, universally, accepted, the, new, testament, is, a, collection, of, 27, books, of, 4, different, genres, of, christian, literature, gospels, one, account, of, the, acts, of, the, apostles, epistles, and, an, apocalypse, these, books, can, be, grouped, into, the, gospels, are, narratives, of, jesus, s, last, three, years, of, life, his, death, and, resurrection, the, narrative, literature, provides, an, account, and, history, of, the, very, early, apostolic, age, the, pauline, epistles, are, written, to, individual, church, groups, to, address, problems, provide, encouragement, and, give, instruction, the, pastoral, epistles, discuss, the, pastoral, oversight, of, churches, christian, living, doctrine, and, leadership, the, catholic, epistles, also, called, the, general, epistles, or, lesser, epistles, the, apocalyptic, literature, prophetical, catholicism, protestantism, and, eastern, orthodox, currently, have, the, same, 27, book, new, testament, canon, they, are,

anthropologist, leonard, b, glick, offers, the, modern, example, of, jewish, fundamentalists, in, israel, such, as, shlomo, aviner, a, prominent, theorist, of, the, gush, emunim, movement, who, considers, the, palestinians, to, be, like, biblical, canaanites, and, therefore, suggests, that, israel, must, be, prepared, to, destroy, the, palestinians, if, the, palestinians, do, not, leave, the, land, nur, masalha, argues, that, genocide, is, inherent, in, these, commandments, and, that, they, have, served, as, inspirational, examples, of, divine, support, for, slaughtering, national, opponents, however, the, applicability, of, the, term, to, earlier, periods, of, history, is, questioned, by, sociologists, frank, robert, chalk, and, kurt, jonassohn, since, most, societies, of, the, past, endured, and, practised, genocide, it, was, accepted, at, that, time, as, being, in, the, nature, of, life, because, of, the, coarseness, and, brutality, of, life, the, moral, condemnation, associated, with, terms, like, genocide, are, products, of, modern, morality, 27, the, definition, of, what, constitutes, violence, has, broadened, considerably, over, time, 1, 2, the, bible, reflects, how, perceptions, of, violence, changed, for, its, authors, 261, phyllis, trible, in, her, now, famous, work, texts, of, terror, tells, four, bible, stories, of, suffering, in, ancient,

divinity, and, biblical, criticism, at, the, university, of, glasgow, provides, the, following, view, of, the, diverse, historical, influences, of, the, bible, it, has, inspired, some, of, the, great, monuments, of, human, thought, literature, and, art, it, has, equally, fuelled, some, of, the, worst, excesses, of, human, savagery, self, interest, and, narrow, mindedness, it, has, inspired, men, and, women, to, acts, of, great, service, and, courage, to, fight, for, liberation, and, human, development, and, it, has, provided, the, ideological, fuel, for, societies, which, have, enslaved, their, fellow, human, beings, and, reduced, them, to, abject, poverty, it, has, perhaps, above, all, provided, a, source, of, religious, and, moral, norms, which, have, enabled, communities, to, hold, together, to, care, for, and, to, protect, one, another, yet, precisely, this, strong, sense, of, belonging, has, in, turn, fuelled, ethnic, racial, and, international, tension, and, conflict, it, has, that, is, to, say, been, the, source, of, great, truth, goodness, and, beauty, at, the, same, time, as, it, has, inspired, lies, wickedness, and, ugliness, biblical, texts, have, always, required, interpretation, and, this, has, given, rise, to, multiple, views, and, approaches, according, to, the, interplay, between, various, religions, and, the, book, the, primary, source, of, jewish, commentary, and, interpretation, of, the, hebrew, bible, is, the, talmud, the, talmud, which, means, study, and, learning, is, a, summary, of, ancient, oral, law, and, commentary, on, it, it, is, the, primary, source, of, jewish, law, adin, steinsaltz, writes, that, if, the, bible, is, the, cornerstone, of, judaism, then, the, talmud, is, the, central, pillar, seen, as, the, backbone, of, jewish, creativity, it, is, a, conglomerate, of, law, legend, and, philosophy, a, blend, of, unique, logic, and, shrewd, pragmatism, of, history, and, science, anecdotes, and, humor, all, aimed, toward, the, purpose, of, studying, biblical, torah, christians, often, treat, the, bible, as, a, single, book, and, while, john, barton, says, they, are, some, of, the, most, profound, texts, humanity, has, ever, produced, liberals, and, moderates, see, it, as, a, collection, of, books, that, are, not, perfect, conservative, and, fundamentalist, christians, see, the, bible, differently, and, interpret, it, differently, christianity, interprets, the, bible, differently, than, judaism, does, with, islam, providing, yet, another, view, how, inspiration, works, and, what, kind, of, authority, it, means, the, bible, has, are, different, for, different, traditions, the, second, epistle, to, timothy, claims, all, scripture, is, breathed, out, by, god, and, profitable, for, teaching, for, reproof, for, correction, and, for, training, in, righteousness, 2, tim, 3, 16, various, related, but, distinguishable, views, on, divine, inspiration, include, within, these, broad, beliefs, many, schools, of, hermeneutics, operate, bible, scholars, claim, that, discussions, about, the, bible, must, be, put, into, its, context, within, church, history, and, then, into, the, context, of, contemporary, culture, fundamentalist, christians, are, associated, with, the, doctrine, of, biblical, literalism, where, the, bible, is, not, only, inerrant, but, the, meaning, of, the, text, is, clear, to, the, average, reader, jewish, antiquity, attests, to, belief, in, sacred, texts, and, a, similar, belief, emerges, in, the, earliest, of, christian, writings, various, texts, of, the, bible, mention, divine, agency, in, relation, to, its, writings, in, their, book, a, general, introduction, to, the, bible, norman, geisler, and, william, nix, write, the, process, of, inspiration, is, a, mystery, of, the, providence, of, god, but, the, result, of, this, process, is, a, verbal, plenary, inerrant, and, authoritative, record, most, evangelical, biblical, scholars, associate, inspiration, with, only, the, original, text, for, example, some, american, protestants, adhere, to, the, 1978, chicago, statement, on, biblical, inerrancy, which, asserted, that, inspiration, applied, only, to, the, autographic, text, of, scripture, among, adherents, of, biblical, literalism, a, minority, such, as, followers, of, the, king, james, only, movement, extend, the, claim, of, inerrancy, only, to, a, particular, version, both, judaism, and, christianity, see, the, bible, as, religiously, and, intellectually, significant, it, provides, insight, into, its, time, and, into, the, composition, of, the, texts, and, it, represents, an, important, step, in, the, development, of, thought, it, is, used, in, communal, worship, recited, and, memorized, provides, personal, guidance, a, basis, for, counseling, church, doctrine, religious, culture, teaching, hymns, and, worship, and, ethical, standards, 145, the, bible, is, centrally, important, to, both, judaism, and, christianity, but, not, as, a, holy, text, out, of, which, entire, religious, systems, can, somehow, be, read, its, contents, illuminate, the, origins, of, christianity, and, judaism, and, provide, spiritual, classics, on, which, both, faiths, can, draw, but, they, do, not, constrain, subsequent, generations, in, the, way, that, a, written, constitution, would, they, are, simply, not, that, kind, of, thing, they, are, a, repository, of, writings, both, shaping, and, shaped, by, the, two, religions, as, a, result, there, are, teachings, and, creeds, in, christianity, and, laws, in, judaism, that, are, seen, by, those, religions, as, derived, from, the, bible, which, are, not, directly, in, the, bible, for, the, hebrew, bible, canonization, is, reserved, for, written, texts, while, sacralization, reaches, far, back, into, oral, tradition, 80, when, sacred, stories, such, as, those, that, form, the, narrative, base, of, the, first, five, books, of, the, bible, were, performed, not, a, syllable, be, changed, in, order, to, ensure, the, magical, power, of, the, words, to, presentify, the, divine, 80, inflexibility, protected, the, texts, from, a, changing, world, 80, when, sacred, oral, texts, began, the, move, to, written, transmission, commentary, began, being, worked, in, but, once, the, text, was, closed, by, canonization, commentary, needed, to, remain, outside, commentary, still, had, significance, sacred, written, texts, were, thereafter, accompanied, by, commentary, and, such, commentary, was, sometimes, written, and, sometimes, orally, transmitted, as, is, the, case, in, the, islamic, madrasa, and, the, jewish, yeshiva, 81, arguing, that, torah, has, had, a, definitive, role, in, developing, jewish, identity, from, its, earliest, days, john, j, collins, explains, that, regardless, of, genetics, or, land, it, has, long, been, true, that, one, could, become, jewish, by, observing, the, laws, in, the, torah, and, that, remains, true, in, the, modern, day, the, christian, religion, and, its, sacred, book, are, connected, and, influence, one, another, but, the, significance, of, the, written, text, has, varied, throughout, history, for, christianity, holiness, did, not, reside, in, the, written, text, or, in, any, particular, language, it, resided, in, the, christ, the, text, witnessed, to, david, m, carr, writes, that, this, gave, early, christianity, a, more, flexible, view, of, the, written, texts, 279, wilfred, cantwell, smith, points, out, that, in, the, islamic, system, the, quran, fulfills, a, function, comparable, to, the, role, played, by, the, person, of, jesus, christ, while, a, closer, counterpart, to, christian, scriptures, are, the, islamic, hadith, traditions, 133, for, centuries, the, written, text, had, less, significance, than, the, will, of, the, church, as, represented, by, the, pope, since, the, church, saw, the, text, as, having, been, created, by, the, church, one, cause, of, the, reformation, was, the, perceived, need, to, reorient, christianity, around, its, early, text, as, authoritative, 13, some, protestant, churches, still, focus, on, the, idea, of, sola, scriptura, which, sees, scripture, as, the, only, legitimate, religious, authority, some, denominations, today, support, the, use, of, the, bible, as, the, only, infallible, source, of, christian, teaching, others, though, advance, the, concept, of, prima, scriptura, in, contrast, meaning, scripture, primarily, or, scripture, mainly, in, the, 21st, century, attitudes, towards, the, significance, of, the, bible, continue, to, differ, roman, catholics, high, church, anglicans, methodists, and, eastern, orthodox, christians, stress, the, harmony, and, importance, of, both, the, bible, and, sacred, tradition, in, combination, united, methodists, see, scripture, as, the, major, factor, in, christian, doctrine, but, they, also, emphasize, the, importance, of, tradition, experience, and, reason, lutherans, teach, that, the, bible, is, the, sole, source, for, christian, doctrine, muslims, view, the, bible, as, reflecting, the, true, unfolding, revelation, from, god, but, revelation, which, had, been, corrupted, or, distorted, in, arabic, tahrif, and, therefore, necessitated, correction, by, giving, the, quran, to, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, the, rastafari, view, the, bible, as, essential, to, their, religion, while, the, unitarian, universalists, view, it, as, one, of, many, important, religious, texts, the, original, texts, of, the, tanakh, were, almost, entirely, written, in, hebrew, with, about, one, per, cent, in, aramaic, the, earliest, translation, of, any, bible, text, is, the, septuagint, which, translated, the, hebrew, into, greek, as, the, first, translation, of, any, biblical, literature, the, translation, that, became, the, septuagint, was, an, unparalleled, event, in, the, ancient, world, this, translation, was, made, possible, by, a, common, mediterranean, culture, where, semitism, had, been, foundational, to, greek, culture, in, the, talmud, greek, is, the, only, language, officially, allowed, for, translation, the, targum, onkelos, is, the, aramaic, translation, of, the, hebrew, bible, believed, to, have, been, written, in, the, second, century, ce, these, texts, attracted, the, work, of, various, scholars, but, a, standardized, text, was, not, available, before, the, 9th, century, there, were, different, ancient, versions, of, the, tanakh, in, hebrew, these, were, copied, and, edited, in, three, different, locations, producing, slightly, varying, results, masoretic, scholars, in, tiberias, in, ancient, palestine, copied, the, ancient, texts, in, tiberian, hebrew, a, copy, was, recovered, from, the, cave, of, elijah, the, synagogue, of, aleppo, in, the, judean, desert, and, is, therefore, referred, to, as, the, aleppo, codex, which, dates, to, around, 920, this, codex, which, is, over, a, thousand, years, old, was, originally, the, oldest, codex, of, the, complete, tiberian, hebrew, bible, babylonian, masoretes, had, also, copied, the, early, texts, and, the, tiberian, and, babylonian, were, later, combined, using, the, aleppo, codex, and, additional, writings, to, form, the, ben, asher, masoretic, tradition, which, is, the, standardized, hebrew, bible, of, today, the, aleppo, codex, is, no, longer, the, oldest, complete, manuscript, because, during, riots, in, 1947, the, aleppo, codex, was, removed, from, its, location, and, about, 40, of, it, was, subsequently, lost, it, must, now, rely, on, additional, manuscripts, and, as, a, result, the, aleppo, codex, contains, the, most, comprehensive, collection, of, variant, readings, the, oldest, complete, version, of, the, masoretic, tradition, is, the, leningrad, codex, from, 1008, it, is, the, source, for, all, modern, jewish, and, christian, translations, levidas, writes, that, the, koine, greek, new, testament, is, a, non, translated, work, most, scholars, agree, on, this, despite, disagreement, on, the, possibility, that, some, passages, may, have, appeared, initially, in, aramaic, it, is, written, in, the, koine, greek, of, the, first, century, early, christians, translated, the, new, testament, into, old, syriac, coptic, ethiopic, and, latin, among, other, languages, the, earliest, latin, translation, was, the, old, latin, text, or, vetus, latina, which, from, internal, evidence, seems, to, have, been, made, by, several, authors, over, a, period, of, time, pope, damasus, i, 366, 383, commissioned, jerome, to, produce, a, reliable, and, consistent, text, by, translating, the, original, greek, and, hebrew, texts, into, latin, this, translation, became, known, as, the, latin, vulgate, bible, in, the, 4th, century, ce, although, jerome, expressed, in, his, prologues, to, most, deuterocanonical, books, that, they, were, non, canonical, in, 1546, at, the, council, of, trent, jerome, s, vulgate, translation, was, declared, by, the, roman, catholic, church, to, be, the, only, authentic, and, official, bible, in, the, latin, church, the, greek, speaking, east, continued, to, use, the, septuagint, translations, of, the, old, testament, and, they, had, no, need, to, translate, the, greek, new, testament, this, contributed, to, the, east, west, schism, many, ancient, translations, coincide, with, the, invention, of, the, alphabet, and, the, beginning, of, vernacular, literature, in, those, languages, according, to, british, academy, professor, n, fern, ndez, marcos, these, early, translations, represent, pioneer, works, of, enormous, linguistic, interest, as, they, represent, the, oldest, documents, we, have, for, the, study, of, these, languages, and, literature, translations, to, english, can, be, traced, to, the, seventh, century, alfred, the, great, in, the, 9th, century, the, toledo, school, of, translators, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, century, roger, bacon, 1220, 1292, an, english, franciscan, friar, of, the, 13th, century, and, multiple, writers, of, the, renaissance, the, wycliffite, bible, which, is, one, of, the, most, significant, in, the, development, of, a, written, standard, dates, from, the, late, middle, english, period, william, tyndale, s, translation, of, 1525, is, seen, by, several, scholars, as, having, influenced, the, form, of, english, christian, discourse, as, well, as, impacting, the, development, of, the, english, language, itself, martin, luther, translated, the, new, testament, into, german, in, 1522, and, both, testaments, with, apocrypha, in, 1534, thereby, contributing, to, the, multiple, wars, of, the, age, of, reformation, and, counter, reformation, important, biblical, translations, of, this, period, include, the, polish, jakub, wujek, bible, biblia, jakuba, wujka, from, 1535, and, the, english, king, james, authorized, version, 1604, 1611, the, king, james, version, was, the, most, widespread, english, bible, of, all, time, but, it, has, largely, been, superseded, by, modern, translations, some, new, testaments, verses, found, to, be, later, additions, to, the, text, are, not, included, in, modern, english, translations, despite, appearing, in, older, english, translations, such, as, the, king, james, version, some, denominations, have, additional, canonical, texts, beyond, the, bible, including, the, standard, works, of, the, latter, day, saints, movement, and, divine, principle, in, the, unification, church, nearly, all, modern, english, translations, of, the, old, testament, are, based, on, a, single, manuscript, the, leningrad, codex, copied, in, 1008, or, 1009, it, is, a, complete, example, of, the, masoretic, text, and, its, published, edition, is, used, by, the, majority, of, scholars, the, aleppo, codex, is, the, basis, of, the, hebrew, university, bible, project, in, jerusalem, since, the, reformation, era, bible, translations, have, been, made, into, the, common, vernacular, of, many, languages, the, bible, continues, to, be, translated, to, new, languages, largely, by, christian, organizations, such, as, wycliffe, bible, translators, new, tribes, mission, and, bible, societies, lamin, sanneh, writes, that, tracing, the, impact, on, the, local, cultures, of, translating, the, bible, into, local, vernacular, language, shows, it, has, produced, the, movements, of, indigenization, and, cultural, liberation, the, translated, scripture, has, become, the, benchmark, of, awakening, and, renewal, biblical, archaeology, is, a, subsection, of, archaeology, that, relates, to, and, sheds, light, upon, the, hebrew, scriptures, and, the, new, testament, it, is, used, to, help, determine, the, lifestyle, and, practices, of, people, living, in, biblical, times, there, are, a, wide, range, of, interpretations, in, the, field, of, biblical, archaeology, one, broad, division, includes, biblical, maximalism, which, generally, takes, the, view, that, most, of, the, old, testament, or, the, hebrew, bible, is, based, on, history, although, it, is, presented, through, the, religious, viewpoint, of, its, time, according, to, historian, lester, l, grabbe, there, are, few, if, any, maximalists, in, mainstream, scholarship, it, is, considered, to, be, the, extreme, opposite, of, biblical, minimalism, which, considers, the, bible, to, be, a, purely, post, exilic, 5th, century, bce, and, later, composition, according, to, mary, joan, leith, professor, of, religious, studies, many, minimalists, have, ignored, evidence, for, the, antiquity, of, the, hebrew, language, in, the, bible, and, few, take, archaeological, evidence, into, consideration, most, biblical, scholars, and, archaeologists, fall, somewhere, on, a, spectrum, between, these, two, the, biblical, account, of, events, of, the, exodus, from, egypt, in, the, torah, the, migration, to, the, promised, land, and, the, period, of, judges, are, sources, of, heated, ongoing, debate, there, is, an, absence, of, evidence, for, the, presence, of, israel, in, egypt, from, any, egyptian, source, historical, or, archaeological, yet, as, william, dever, points, out, these, biblical, traditions, were, written, long, after, the, events, they, describe, and, they, are, based, in, sources, now, lost, and, older, oral, traditions, the, hebrew, bible, old, testament, ancient, non, biblical, texts, and, archaeology, support, the, babylonian, captivity, beginning, around, 586, bce, excavations, in, southern, judah, show, a, pattern, of, destruction, consistent, with, the, neo, assyrian, devastation, of, judah, at, the, end, of, the, eighth, century, bce, and, 2, kings, 18, 13, in, 1993, at, tel, dan, archaeologist, avraham, biran, unearthed, a, fragmentary, aramaic, inscription, the, tel, dan, stele, dated, to, the, late, ninth, or, early, eighth, century, that, mentions, a, king, of, israel, as, well, as, a, house, of, david, bet, david, this, shows, david, could, not, be, a, late, sixth, century, invention, and, implies, that, judah, s, kings, traced, their, lineage, back, to, someone, named, david, however, there, is, no, current, archaeological, evidence, for, the, existence, of, king, david, and, solomon, or, the, first, temple, as, far, back, as, the, tenth, century, bce, where, the, bible, places, them, in, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, surveys, demonstrated, that, acts, of, the, apostles, acts, scholarship, was, divided, into, two, traditions, a, conservative, largely, british, tradition, which, had, great, confidence, in, the, historicity, of, acts, and, a, less, conservative, largely, german, tradition, which, had, very, little, confidence, in, the, historicity, of, acts, subsequent, surveys, show, that, little, has, changed, author, thomas, e, phillips, writes, that, in, this, two, century, long, debate, over, the, historicity, of, acts, and, its, underlying, traditions, only, one, assumption, seemed, to, be, shared, by, all, acts, was, intended, to, be, read, as, history, this, too, is, now, being, debated, by, scholars, as, what, genre, does, acts, actually, belong, to, there, is, a, growing, consensus, however, that, the, question, of, genre, is, unsolvable, and, would, not, in, any, case, solve, the, issue, of, historicity, is, acts, history, or, fiction, in, the, eyes, of, most, scholars, it, is, history, but, not, the, kind, of, history, that, precludes, fiction, says, phillips, biblical, criticism, refers, to, the, analytical, investigation, of, the, bible, as, a, text, and, addresses, questions, such, as, history, authorship, dates, of, composition, and, authorial, intention, it, is, not, the, same, as, criticism, of, the, bible, which, is, an, assertion, against, the, bible, being, a, source, of, information, or, ethical, guidance, nor, is, it, criticism, of, possible, translation, errors, biblical, criticism, made, study, of, the, bible, secularized, scholarly, and, more, democratic, while, it, also, permanently, altered, the, way, people, understood, the, bible, the, bible, is, no, longer, thought, of, solely, as, a, religious, artefact, and, its, interpretation, is, no, longer, restricted, to, the, community, of, believers, michael, fishbane, writes, there, are, those, who, regard, the, desacralization, of, the, bible, as, the, fortunate, condition, for, the, development, of, the, modern, world, for, many, biblical, criticism, released, a, host, of, threats, to, the, christian, faith, for, others, biblical, criticism, proved, to, be, a, failure, due, principally, to, the, assumption, that, diachronic, linear, research, could, master, any, and, all, of, the, questions, and, problems, attendant, on, interpretation, still, others, believed, that, biblical, criticism, shorn, of, its, unwarranted, arrogance, could, be, a, reliable, source, of, interpretation, michael, fishbane, compares, biblical, criticism, to, job, a, prophet, who, destroyed, self, serving, visions, for, the, sake, of, a, more, honest, crossing, from, the, divine, textus, to, the, human, one, or, as, rogerson, says, biblical, criticism, has, been, liberating, for, those, who, want, their, faith, intelligently, grounded, and, intellectually, honest, the, grandest, medieval, bibles, were, illuminated, manuscripts, in, which, the, text, is, supplemented, by, the, addition, of, decoration, such, as, decorated, initials, borders, marginalia, and, miniature, illustrations, up, to, the, 12th, century, most, manuscripts, were, produced, in, monasteries, in, order, to, add, to, the, library, or, after, receiving, a, commission, from, a, wealthy, patron, larger, monasteries, often, contained, separate, areas, for, the, monks, who, specialized, in, the, production, of, manuscripts, called, a, scriptorium, where, separate, little, rooms, were, assigned, to, book, copying, they, were, situated, in, such, a, way, that, each, scribe, had, to, himself, a, window, open, to, the, cloister, walk, by, the, 14th, century, the, cloisters, of, monks, writing, in, the, scriptorium, started, to, employ, laybrothers, from, the, urban, scriptoria, especially, in, paris, rome, and, the, netherlands, demand, for, manuscripts, grew, to, an, extent, that, the, monastic, libraries, were, unable, to, meet, with, the, demand, and, began, employing, secular, scribes, and, illuminators, these, individuals, often, lived, close, to, the, monastery, and, in, certain, instances, dressed, as, monks, whenever, they, entered, the, monastery, but, were, allowed, to, leave, at, the, end, of, the, day, a, notable, example, of, an, illuminated, manuscript, is, the, book, of, kells, produced, circa, the, year, 800, containing, the, four, gospels, of, the, new, testament, together, with, various, prefatory, texts, and, tables, the, manuscript, was, sent, to, the, rubricator, who, added, in, red, or, other, colours, the, titles, headlines, the, initials, of, chapters, and, sections, the, notes, and, so, on, and, then, if, the, book, was, to, be, illustrated, it, was, sent, to, the, illuminator, in, the, case, of, manuscripts, that, were, sold, commercially, the, writing, would, undoubtedly, have, been, discussed, initially, between, the, patron, and, the, scribe, or, the, scribe, s, agent, but, by, the, time, that, the, written, gathering, were, sent, off, to, the, illuminator, there, was, no, longer, any, scope, for, innovation, but, if, anyone, receive, not, as, sacred, and, canonical, the, said, books, entire, with, all, their, parts, as, they, have, been, used, to, be, read, in, the, catholic, church, and, as, they, are, contained, in, the, old, latin, vulgate, edition, and, knowingly, and, deliberately, contemn, the, traditions, aforesaid, let, him, be, anathema
