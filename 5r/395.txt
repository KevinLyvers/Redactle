inanna, is, the, ancient, mesopotamian, goddess, of, love, war, and, fertility, she, is, also, associated, with, sensuality, procreation, divine, law, and, political, power, originally, worshipped, in, sumer, she, was, known, by, the, akkadian, empire, babylonians, and, assyrians, as, ishtar, and, occasionally, the, logogram, her, primary, title, is, the, queen, of, heaven, she, was, the, patron, goddess, of, the, eanna, temple, at, the, city, of, uruk, her, early, main, cult, center, in, archaic, uruk, she, was, worshipped, in, three, forms, morning, inanna, inana, ud, hud, evening, inanna, inanna, sig, and, princely, inanna, inanna, nun, the, former, two, reflecting, the, phases, of, her, associated, planet, venus, her, most, prominent, symbols, include, the, lion, and, the, eight, pointed, star, her, husband, is, the, god, dumuzid, later, known, as, tammuz, and, her, sukkal, attendant, is, the, goddess, ninshubur, later, conflated, with, the, male, deities, ilabrat, and, papsukkal, inanna, was, worshipped, in, sumer, at, least, as, early, as, the, uruk, period, c, 4000, 3100, bce, and, her, cultic, activity, was, relatively, localized, before, the, conquest, of, sargon, of, akkad, during, the, post, sargonic, era, she, became, one, of, the, most, widely, venerated, deities, in, the, sumerian, pantheon, with, temples, across, mesopotamia, the, cult, of, inanna, ishtar, which, may, have, been, associated, with, a, variety, of, sexual, rites, was, continued, by, the, east, semitic, speaking, peoples, akkadians, assyrians, and, babylonians, who, succeeded, and, absorbed, the, sumerians, in, the, region, she, was, especially, beloved, by, the, assyrians, who, elevated, her, to, become, the, highest, deity, in, their, pantheon, ranking, above, their, own, national, god, ashur, inanna, ishtar, is, alluded, to, in, the, hebrew, bible, and, she, greatly, influenced, the, ugaritic, goddess, ashtart, and, later, the, phoenician, goddess, astarte, who, in, turn, possibly, influenced, the, development, of, the, greek, goddess, aphrodite, her, cult, continued, to, flourish, until, its, gradual, decline, between, the, first, and, sixth, centuries, ce, in, the, wake, of, christianity, inanna, appears, in, more, myths, than, any, other, sumerian, deity, she, also, has, a, uniquely, high, number, of, epithets, and, alternate, names, comparable, only, to, nergal, many, of, her, myths, involve, her, taking, over, the, domains, of, other, deities, she, is, believed, to, have, been, given, the, mes, which, represent, all, positive, and, negative, aspects, of, civilization, by, enki, the, god, of, wisdom, she, is, also, believed, to, have, taken, over, the, eanna, temple, from, an, the, god, of, the, sky, alongside, her, twin, brother, utu, later, known, as, shamash, inanna, is, the, enforcer, of, divine, justice, she, destroyed, mount, ebih, for, having, challenged, her, authority, unleashed, her, fury, upon, the, gardener, shukaletuda, after, he, raped, her, in, her, sleep, and, tracked, down, the, bandit, woman, bilulu, and, killed, her, in, divine, retribution, for, having, murdered, dumuzid, in, the, standard, akkadian, version, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, ishtar, asks, gilgamesh, to, become, her, consort, when, he, disdainfully, refuses, she, unleashes, the, bull, of, heaven, resulting, in, the, death, of, enkidu, and, gilgamesh, s, subsequent, grapple, with, his, own, mortality, inanna, s, most, famous, myth, is, the, story, of, her, descent, into, and, return, from, the, ancient, mesopotamian, underworld, ruled, by, her, older, sister, ereshkigal, after, she, reaches, ereshkigal, s, throne, room, the, seven, judges, of, the, underworld, deem, her, guilty, and, strike, her, dead, three, days, later, ninshubur, pleads, with, all, the, gods, to, bring, inanna, back, all, of, them, refuse, her, except, enki, who, sends, two, sexless, beings, to, rescue, inanna, they, escort, inanna, out, of, the, underworld, but, the, galla, the, guardians, of, the, underworld, drag, her, husband, dumuzid, down, to, the, underworld, as, her, replacement, dumuzid, is, eventually, permitted, to, return, to, heaven, for, half, the, year, while, his, sister, geshtinanna, remains, in, the, underworld, for, the, other, half, resulting, in, the, cycle, of, the, seasons, scholars, believe, that, inanna, and, ishtar, were, originally, separate, unrelated, deities, but, were, conflated, with, one, another, during, the, reign, of, sargon, of, akkad, and, came, to, be, regarded, as, effectively, the, same, goddess, under, two, different, names, inanna, s, name, may, derive, from, the, sumerian, phrase, nin, an, ak, meaning, lady, of, heaven, but, the, cuneiform, sign, for, inanna, is, not, a, ligature, of, the, signs, lady, sumerian, nin, cuneiform, sal, tug, 2, and, sky, sumerian, an, cuneiform, an, these, difficulties, led, some, early, assyriologists, to, suggest, that, inanna, may, have, originally, been, a, proto, euphratean, goddess, who, was, only, later, accepted, into, the, sumerian, pantheon, this, idea, was, supported, by, inanna, s, youthfulness, as, well, as, the, fact, that, unlike, the, other, sumerian, divinities, she, seems, to, have, initially, lacked, a, distinct, sphere, of, responsibilities, the, view, that, there, was, a, proto, euphratean, substrate, language, in, southern, iraq, before, sumerian, is, not, widely, accepted, by, modern, assyriologists, the, name, ishtar, occurs, as, an, element, in, personal, names, from, both, the, pre, sargonic, and, post, sargonic, eras, in, akkad, assyria, and, babylonia, it, is, of, semitic, derivation, and, is, probably, etymologically, related, to, the, name, of, the, west, semitic, god, attar, who, is, mentioned, in, later, inscriptions, from, ugarit, and, southern, arabia, the, morning, star, may, have, been, conceived, as, a, male, deity, who, presided, over, the, arts, of, war, and, the, evening, star, may, have, been, conceived, as, a, female, deity, who, presided, over, the, arts, of, love, among, the, akkadians, assyrians, and, babylonians, the, name, of, the, male, god, eventually, supplanted, the, name, of, his, female, counterpart, but, due, to, extensive, syncretism, with, inanna, the, deity, remained, as, female, although, her, name, was, in, the, masculine, form, inanna, has, posed, a, problem, for, many, scholars, of, ancient, sumer, due, to, the, fact, that, her, sphere, of, power, contained, more, distinct, and, contradictory, aspects, than, that, of, any, other, deity, two, major, theories, regarding, her, origins, have, been, proposed, the, first, explanation, holds, that, inanna, is, the, result, of, a, syncretism, between, several, previously, unrelated, sumerian, deities, with, totally, different, domains, the, second, explanation, holds, that, inanna, was, originally, a, semitic, deity, who, entered, the, sumerian, pantheon, after, it, was, already, fully, structured, and, who, took, on, all, the, roles, that, had, not, yet, been, assigned, to, other, deities, as, early, as, the, uruk, period, c, 4000, 3100, bce, inanna, was, already, associated, with, the, city, of, uruk, during, this, period, the, symbol, of, a, ring, headed, doorpost, was, closely, associated, with, inanna, the, famous, uruk, vase, found, in, a, deposit, of, cult, objects, of, the, uruk, iii, period, depicts, a, row, of, naked, men, carrying, various, objects, including, bowls, vessels, and, baskets, of, farm, products, and, bringing, sheep, and, goats, to, a, female, figure, facing, the, ruler, the, female, stands, in, front, of, inanna, s, symbol, of, the, two, twisted, reeds, of, the, doorpost, while, the, male, figure, holds, a, box, and, stack, of, bowls, the, later, cuneiform, sign, signifying, the, en, or, high, priest, of, the, temple, seal, impressions, from, the, jemdet, nasr, period, c, 3100, 2900, bce, show, a, fixed, sequence, of, symbols, representing, various, cities, including, those, of, ur, larsa, zabalam, urum, arina, and, probably, kesh, this, list, probably, reflects, the, report, of, contributions, to, inanna, at, uruk, from, cities, supporting, her, cult, a, large, number, of, similar, seals, have, been, discovered, from, phase, i, of, the, early, dynastic, period, c, 2900, 2350, bce, at, ur, in, a, slightly, different, order, combined, with, the, rosette, symbol, of, inanna, these, seals, were, used, to, lock, storerooms, to, preserve, materials, set, aside, for, her, cult, various, inscriptions, in, the, name, of, inanna, are, known, such, as, a, bead, in, the, name, of, king, aga, of, kish, c, 2600, bce, or, a, tablet, by, king, lugal, kisalsi, c, 2400, bce, for, an, king, of, all, the, lands, and, for, inanna, his, mistress, lugal, kisalsi, king, of, kish, built, the, wall, of, the, courtyard, during, the, akkadian, period, c, 2334, 2154, bce, following, the, conquests, of, sargon, of, akkad, inanna, and, originally, independent, ishtar, became, so, extensively, syncretized, that, they, became, regarded, as, effectively, the, same, the, akkadian, poet, enheduanna, the, daughter, of, sargon, wrote, numerous, hymns, to, inanna, identifying, her, with, ishtar, as, a, result, of, this, the, popularity, of, inanna, ishtar, s, cult, skyrocketed, alfonso, archi, who, was, involved, in, early, excavations, of, ebla, assumes, ishtar, was, originally, a, goddess, venerated, in, the, euphrates, valley, pointing, out, that, an, association, between, her, and, the, desert, poplar, is, attested, in, the, most, ancient, texts, from, both, ebla, and, mari, he, considers, her, a, moon, god, e, g, sin, and, a, sun, deity, of, varying, gender, shamash, shapash, to, be, the, only, deities, shared, between, various, early, semitic, peoples, of, mesopotamia, and, ancient, syria, who, otherwise, had, different, not, necessarily, overlapping, pantheons, gwendolyn, leick, assumes, that, during, the, pre, sargonic, era, the, cult, of, inanna, was, rather, limited, though, other, experts, argue, that, she, was, already, the, most, prominent, deity, in, uruk, and, a, number, of, other, political, centers, in, the, uruk, period, she, had, temples, in, nippur, lagash, shuruppak, zabalam, and, ur, but, her, main, cult, center, was, the, eanna, temple, in, uruk, whose, name, means, house, of, heaven, sumerian, e, 2, anna, cuneiform, e, 2, an, some, research, assumes, that, the, original, patron, deity, of, this, fourth, millennium, bce, city, was, an, after, its, dedication, to, inanna, the, temple, seems, to, have, housed, priestesses, of, the, goddess, next, to, uruk, zabalam, was, the, most, important, early, site, of, inanna, worship, as, the, name, of, the, city, was, commonly, written, with, the, signs, mu, 3, and, unug, meaning, respectively, inanna, and, sanctuary, it, is, possible, that, the, city, goddess, of, zabalam, was, originally, a, distinct, deity, though, one, whose, cult, was, absorbed, by, that, of, the, urukean, goddess, very, early, on, joan, goodnick, westenholz, proposed, that, a, goddess, identified, by, the, name, nin, um, reading, and, meaning, uncertain, associated, with, ishtaran, in, a, zame, hymn, was, the, original, identity, of, inanna, of, zabalam, in, the, old, akkadian, period, inanna, merged, with, the, akkadian, goddess, ishtar, associated, with, the, city, of, agade, a, hymn, from, that, period, addresses, the, akkadian, ishtar, as, inanna, of, the, ulma, alongside, inanna, of, uruk, and, of, zabalam, the, worship, of, ishtar, and, syncretism, between, her, and, inanna, was, encouraged, by, sargon, and, his, successors, and, as, a, result, she, quickly, became, one, of, the, most, widely, venerated, deities, in, the, mesopotamian, pantheon, in, inscriptions, of, sargon, naram, sin, and, shar, kali, sharri, ishtar, is, the, most, frequently, invoked, deity, in, the, old, babylonian, period, her, main, cult, centers, were, uruk, zabalam, agade, and, ilip, her, cult, was, also, introduced, from, uruk, to, kish, during, later, times, while, her, cult, in, uruk, continued, to, flourish, ishtar, also, became, particularly, worshipped, in, the, upper, mesopotamian, kingdom, of, assyria, modern, northern, iraq, northeast, syria, and, southeast, turkey, especially, in, the, cities, of, nineveh, a, ur, and, arbela, modern, erbil, during, the, reign, of, the, assyrian, king, assurbanipal, ishtar, rose, to, become, the, most, important, and, widely, venerated, deity, in, the, assyrian, pantheon, surpassing, even, the, assyrian, national, god, ashur, votive, objects, found, in, her, primary, assyrian, temple, indicate, that, she, was, a, popular, deity, among, women, individuals, who, went, against, the, gender, binary, were, heavily, involved, in, the, cult, of, inanna, during, sumerian, times, a, set, of, priests, known, as, gala, worked, in, inanna, s, temples, where, they, performed, elegies, and, lamentations, men, who, became, gala, sometimes, adopted, female, names, and, their, songs, were, composed, in, the, sumerian, eme, sal, dialect, which, in, literary, texts, is, normally, reserved, for, the, speech, of, female, characters, some, sumerian, proverbs, seem, to, suggest, that, gala, had, a, reputation, for, engaging, in, anal, sex, with, men, during, the, akkadian, period, kurgarr, and, assinnu, were, servants, of, ishtar, who, dressed, in, female, clothing, and, performed, war, dances, in, ishtar, s, temples, several, akkadian, proverbs, seem, to, suggest, that, they, may, have, also, had, homosexual, proclivities, gwendolyn, leick, an, anthropologist, known, for, her, writings, on, mesopotamia, has, compared, these, individuals, to, the, contemporary, indian, hijra, in, one, akkadian, hymn, ishtar, is, described, as, transforming, men, into, women, throughout, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, it, was, widely, believed, that, the, cult, of, inanna, involved, a, sacred, marriage, ritual, in, which, a, king, would, establish, his, legitimacy, by, taking, on, the, role, of, dumuzid, and, engaging, in, ritual, sexual, intercourse, with, the, high, priestess, of, inanna, who, took, on, the, role, of, the, goddess, this, view, has, been, challenged, however, and, scholars, continue, to, debate, whether, the, sacred, marriage, described, in, literary, texts, involved, any, kind, of, physical, ritual, enactment, at, all, and, if, so, whether, this, ritual, enactment, involved, actual, intercourse, or, merely, the, symbolic, representation, of, intercourse, the, scholar, of, the, ancient, near, east, louise, m, pryke, states, that, most, scholars, now, maintain, if, the, sacred, marriage, was, a, ritual, that, was, actually, acted, out, then, it, involved, only, symbolic, intercourse, the, cult, of, ishtar, was, long, thought, to, have, involved, sacred, prostitution, but, this, is, now, rejected, among, many, scholars, hierodules, known, as, ishtaritum, are, reported, to, have, worked, in, ishtar, s, temples, but, it, is, unclear, if, such, priestesses, actually, performed, any, sex, acts, and, several, modern, scholars, have, argued, that, they, did, not, women, across, the, ancient, near, east, worshipped, ishtar, by, dedicating, to, her, cakes, baked, in, ashes, known, as, kam, n, tumri, a, dedication, of, this, type, is, described, in, an, akkadian, hymn, several, clay, cake, molds, discovered, at, mari, are, shaped, like, naked, women, with, large, hips, clutching, their, breasts, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, cakes, made, from, these, molds, were, intended, as, representations, of, ishtar, herself, inanna, ishtar, s, most, common, symbol, was, the, eight, pointed, star, though, the, exact, number, of, points, sometimes, varies, six, pointed, stars, also, occur, frequently, but, their, symbolic, meaning, is, unknown, the, eight, pointed, star, seems, to, have, originally, borne, a, general, association, with, the, heavens, but, by, the, old, babylonian, period, c, 1830, c, 1531, bce, it, had, come, to, be, specifically, associated, with, the, planet, venus, with, which, ishtar, was, identified, starting, during, this, same, period, the, star, of, ishtar, was, normally, enclosed, within, a, circular, disc, during, later, babylonian, times, slaves, who, worked, in, ishtar, s, temples, were, sometimes, branded, with, the, seal, of, the, eight, pointed, star, on, boundary, stones, and, cylinder, seals, the, eight, pointed, star, is, sometimes, shown, alongside, the, crescent, moon, which, was, the, symbol, of, sin, sumerian, nanna, and, the, rayed, solar, disk, which, was, a, symbol, of, shamash, sumerian, utu, inanna, s, cuneiform, ideogram, was, a, hook, shaped, twisted, knot, of, reeds, representing, the, doorpost, of, the, storehouse, a, common, symbol, of, fertility, and, plenty, the, rosette, was, another, important, symbol, of, inanna, which, continued, to, be, used, as, a, symbol, of, ishtar, after, their, syncretism, during, the, neo, assyrian, period, 911, 609, bce, the, rosette, may, have, actually, eclipsed, the, eight, pointed, star, and, become, ishtar, s, primary, symbol, the, temple, of, ishtar, in, the, city, of, a, ur, was, adorned, with, numerous, rosettes, inanna, ishtar, was, associated, with, lions, which, the, ancient, mesopotamians, regarded, as, a, symbol, of, power, her, associations, with, lions, began, during, sumerian, times, a, chlorite, bowl, from, the, temple, of, inanna, at, nippur, depicts, a, large, feline, battling, a, giant, snake, and, a, cuneiform, inscription, on, the, bowl, reads, inanna, and, the, serpent, indicating, that, the, cat, is, supposed, to, represent, the, goddess, during, the, akkadian, period, ishtar, was, frequently, depicted, as, a, heavily, armed, warrior, goddess, with, a, lion, as, one, of, her, attributes, doves, were, also, prominent, animal, symbols, associated, with, inanna, ishtar, doves, are, shown, on, cultic, objects, associated, with, inanna, as, early, as, the, beginning, of, the, third, millennium, bce, lead, dove, figurines, were, discovered, in, the, temple, of, ishtar, at, a, ur, dating, to, the, thirteenth, century, bce, and, a, painted, fresco, from, mari, syria, shows, a, giant, dove, emerging, from, a, palm, tree, in, the, temple, of, ishtar, indicating, that, the, goddess, herself, was, sometimes, believed, to, take, the, form, of, a, dove, inanna, was, associated, with, the, planet, venus, which, is, named, after, her, roman, equivalent, several, hymns, praise, inanna, in, her, role, as, the, goddess, or, personification, of, the, planet, venus, theology, professor, jeffrey, cooley, has, argued, that, in, many, myths, inanna, s, movements, may, correspond, with, the, movements, of, venus, across, the, sky, in, inanna, s, descent, to, the, underworld, inanna, unlike, any, other, deity, is, able, to, descend, into, the, netherworld, and, return, to, the, heavens, the, planet, venus, appears, to, make, a, similar, descent, setting, in, the, west, and, then, rising, again, in, the, east, an, introductory, hymn, describes, inanna, leaving, the, heavens, and, heading, for, kur, what, could, be, presumed, to, be, the, mountains, replicating, the, rising, and, setting, of, inanna, to, the, west, in, inanna, and, shukaletuda, shukaletuda, is, described, as, scanning, the, heavens, in, search, of, inanna, possibly, searching, the, eastern, and, western, horizons, in, the, same, myth, while, searching, for, her, attacker, inanna, herself, makes, several, movements, that, correspond, with, the, movements, of, venus, in, the, sky, because, the, movements, of, venus, appear, to, be, discontinuous, it, disappears, due, to, its, proximity, to, the, sun, for, many, days, at, a, time, and, then, reappears, on, the, other, horizon, some, cultures, did, not, recognize, venus, as, a, single, entity, instead, they, assumed, it, to, be, two, separate, stars, on, each, horizon, the, morning, and, evening, star, nonetheless, a, cylinder, seal, from, the, jemdet, nasr, period, indicates, that, the, ancient, sumerians, knew, that, the, morning, and, evening, stars, were, the, same, celestial, object, the, discontinuous, movements, of, venus, relate, to, both, mythology, as, well, as, inanna, s, dual, nature, modern, astrologers, recognize, the, story, of, inanna, s, descent, into, the, underworld, as, a, reference, to, an, astronomical, phenomenon, associated, with, retrograde, venus, seven, days, before, retrograde, venus, makes, its, inferior, conjunction, with, the, sun, it, disappears, from, the, evening, sky, the, seven, day, period, between, this, disappearance, and, the, conjunction, itself, is, seen, as, the, astronomical, phenomenon, on, which, the, myth, of, descent, was, based, after, the, conjunction, seven, more, days, elapse, before, venus, appears, as, the, morning, star, corresponding, to, the, ascent, from, the, underworld, inanna, in, her, aspect, as, anun, tu, was, associated, with, the, eastern, fish, of, the, last, of, the, zodiacal, constellations, pisces, her, consort, dumuzi, was, associated, with, the, contiguous, first, constellation, aries, the, sumerians, worshipped, inanna, as, the, goddess, of, both, warfare, and, love, unlike, other, gods, whose, roles, were, static, and, whose, domains, were, limited, the, stories, of, inanna, describe, her, as, moving, from, conquest, to, conquest, she, is, portrayed, as, young, and, impetuous, constantly, striving, for, more, power, than, had, been, allotted, to, her, while, she, was, worshipped, as, the, goddess, of, love, inanna, was, not, the, goddess, of, marriage, nor, was, she, ever, viewed, as, a, mother, goddess, andrew, r, george, goes, as, far, as, stating, that, according, to, all, mythology, i, tar, was, not, temperamentally, disposed, towards, such, functions, julia, m, asher, greve, has, even, proposed, by, asher, greve, that, inanna, was, significant, specifically, because, she, was, not, a, mother, goddess, as, a, love, goddess, she, was, commonly, invoked, by, mesopotamians, in, incantations, in, inanna, s, descent, to, the, underworld, inanna, treats, her, lover, dumuzid, in, a, very, capricious, manner, this, aspect, of, inanna, s, personality, is, emphasized, in, the, later, standard, akkadian, version, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, in, which, gilgamesh, points, out, ishtar, s, infamous, ill, treatment, of, her, lovers, however, according, to, assyriologist, dina, katz, the, portrayal, of, inanna, s, relationship, with, dumuzi, in, the, descent, myth, is, unusual, inanna, was, also, worshipped, as, one, of, the, sumerian, war, deities, one, of, the, hymns, dedicated, to, her, declares, she, stirs, confusion, and, chaos, against, those, who, are, disobedient, to, her, speeding, carnage, and, inciting, the, devastating, flood, clothed, in, terrifying, radiance, it, is, her, game, to, speed, conflict, and, battle, untiring, strapping, on, her, sandals, battle, itself, was, occasionally, referred, to, as, the, dance, of, inanna, epithets, related, to, lions, in, particular, were, meant, to, highlight, this, aspect, of, her, character, as, a, war, goddess, she, was, sometimes, referred, to, with, the, name, irnina, victory, though, this, epithet, could, be, applied, to, other, deities, as, well, in, addition, to, functioning, as, a, distinct, goddess, linked, to, ningishzida, rather, than, to, ishtar, another, epithet, highlighting, this, aspect, of, ishtar, s, nature, was, anunitu, the, martial, one, like, irnina, anunitu, could, also, be, a, separate, deity, and, as, such, she, is, first, attested, in, documents, from, the, ur, iii, period, assyrian, royal, curse, formulas, invoked, both, of, ishtar, s, primary, functions, at, once, invoking, her, to, remove, potency, and, martial, valor, alike, mesopotamian, texts, indicate, that, traits, perceived, as, heroic, such, as, a, king, s, ability, to, lead, his, troops, and, to, triumph, over, enemies, and, sexual, prowess, were, regarded, as, interconnected, while, inanna, ishtar, was, a, goddess, her, gender, could, be, ambiguous, at, times, gary, beckman, states, that, ambiguous, gender, identification, was, a, characteristic, not, just, of, ishtar, herself, but, of, a, category, of, deities, he, refers, to, as, ishtar, type, goddesses, such, as, shaushka, pinikir, or, ninsianna, a, late, hymn, contains, the, phrase, she, is, enlil, she, is, ninil, which, might, be, a, reference, to, occasionally, dimorphic, character, of, ishtar, in, addition, to, serving, as, an, exaltation, a, hymn, to, nanaya, alludes, to, a, male, aspect, of, ishtar, from, babylon, alongside, a, variety, of, more, standard, descriptions, however, ilona, zsolnay, only, describes, ishtar, as, a, feminine, figure, who, performed, a, masculine, role, in, certain, contexts, for, example, as, a, war, deity, inanna, s, twin, brother, was, utu, known, as, shamash, in, akkadian, the, god, of, the, sun, and, justice, in, sumerian, texts, inanna, and, utu, are, depicted, as, extremely, close, some, modern, authors, even, perceive, their, relationship, as, bordering, on, incestuous, in, the, myth, of, her, descent, into, the, underworld, inanna, addresses, ereshkigal, the, queen, of, the, underworld, as, her, older, sister, yet, the, two, goddesses, almost, never, appear, together, elsewhere, in, sumerian, literature, and, were, not, placed, in, the, same, category, in, god, lists, in, some, neo, assyrian, sources, ishtar, is, also, associated, with, adad, with, the, relationship, mirroring, that, between, shaushka, and, her, brother, teshub, in, hurrian, mythology, the, most, common, tradition, regarded, nanna, and, his, wife, ningal, as, her, parents, examples, of, it, are, present, in, sources, as, diverse, as, a, god, list, from, the, early, dynastic, period, a, hymn, of, ishme, dagan, relaying, how, enlil, and, ninlil, bestowed, inanna, s, powers, upon, her, a, late, syncretic, hymn, to, nanaya, and, an, akkadian, ritual, from, hattusa, while, some, authors, assert, that, in, uruk, inanna, was, usually, regarded, as, the, daughter, of, the, sky, god, an, it, is, possible, that, references, to, him, as, her, father, are, only, referring, to, his, status, as, an, ancestor, of, nanna, and, thus, his, daughter, in, literary, texts, enlil, or, enki, may, be, addressed, as, her, fathers, but, references, to, major, gods, being, fathers, can, also, be, examples, of, the, use, of, this, word, as, an, epithet, indicating, seniority, dumuzid, later, known, as, tammuz, the, god, of, shepherds, is, usually, described, as, inanna, s, husband, but, according, to, some, interpretations, inanna, s, loyalty, to, him, is, questionable, in, the, myth, of, her, descent, into, the, underworld, she, abandons, dumuzid, and, permits, the, galla, demons, to, drag, him, down, into, the, underworld, as, her, replacement, in, a, different, myth, the, return, of, dumuzid, inanna, instead, mourns, over, dumuzid, s, death, and, ultimately, decrees, that, he, will, be, allowed, to, return, to, heaven, to, be, with, her, for, one, half, of, the, year, dina, katz, notes, that, the, portrayal, of, their, relationship, in, inanna, s, descent, is, unusual, it, does, not, resemble, the, portrayal, of, their, relationship, in, other, myths, about, dumuzi, s, death, which, almost, never, pin, the, blame, for, it, on, inanna, but, rather, on, demons, or, even, human, bandits, a, large, corpus, of, love, poetry, describing, encounters, between, inanna, and, dumuzi, has, been, assembled, by, researchers, however, local, manifestations, of, inanna, ishtar, were, not, necessarily, associated, with, dumuzi, in, kish, the, tutelary, deity, of, the, city, zababa, a, war, god, was, viewed, as, the, consort, of, a, local, hypostasis, of, ishtar, though, after, the, old, babylonian, period, bau, introduced, from, lagash, became, his, spouse, an, example, of, a, couple, consisting, out, of, a, warrior, god, and, a, medicine, goddess, common, in, mesopotamian, mythology, and, ishtar, of, kish, started, to, instead, be, worshipped, on, her, own, inanna, is, not, usually, described, as, having, any, offspring, however, in, the, myth, of, lugalbanda, as, well, as, in, a, single, building, inscription, from, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, c, 2112, c, 2004, bce, the, warrior, god, shara, is, described, as, her, son, she, was, also, sometimes, considered, the, mother, of, lulal, who, is, described, in, other, texts, as, the, son, of, ninsun, wilfred, g, lambert, described, the, relation, between, inanna, and, lulal, as, close, but, unspecified, in, the, context, of, inanna, s, descent, there, is, also, similarly, scarce, evidence, for, the, love, goddess, nanaya, being, regarded, as, her, daughter, but, it, is, possible, all, of, these, instances, merely, refer, to, an, epithet, indicating, closeness, between, the, deities, and, were, not, a, statement, about, actual, parentage, inanna, s, sukkal, was, the, goddess, ninshubur, whose, relationship, with, inanna, is, one, of, mutual, devotion, in, some, texts, ninshubur, is, listed, right, after, dumuzi, as, a, member, of, inanna, s, circle, even, before, some, of, her, relatives, in, one, text, the, phrase, ninshubur, beloved, vizier, appears, in, another, text, ninshubur, is, listed, even, before, nanaya, originally, possibly, a, hypostasis, of, inanna, herself, in, a, list, of, deities, from, her, entourage, in, an, akkadian, ritual, text, known, from, hittite, archives, ishtar, s, sukkal, is, invoked, alongside, her, family, members, sin, ningal, and, shamash, other, members, of, inanna, s, entourage, frequently, listed, in, god, lists, are, the, goddesses, nanaya, kanisurra, gazbaba, and, bizila, all, of, them, also, associated, with, each, other, in, various, configurations, independently, from, this, context, in, addition, to, the, full, conflation, of, inanna, and, ishtar, during, the, reign, of, sargon, and, his, successors, she, was, syncretised, with, a, large, number, of, deities, to, a, varying, degree, the, oldest, known, syncretic, hymn, is, dedicated, to, inanna, and, has, been, dated, to, the, early, dynastic, period, many, god, lists, compiled, by,

tablet, due, to, most, of, its, contents, being, the, names, of, ishtar, s, equivalents, her, titles, and, various, attendants, some, modern, researchers, use, the, term, ishtar, type, to, define, specific, figures, of, this, variety, some, texts, contained, references, to, all, the, ishtars, of, a, given, area, in, later, periods, ishtar, s, name, was, sometimes, used, as, a, generic, term, goddess, in, babylonia, while, a, logographic, writing, of, inanna, was, used, to, spell, the, title, b, ltu, leading, to, further, conflations, a, possible, example, of, such, use, of, the, name, is, also, known, from, elam, as, a, single, elamite, inscription, written, in, akkadian, refers, to, manzat, ishtar, which, might, in, this, context, mean, the, goddess, manzat, the, poem, enki, and, the,

which, will, reveal, to, her, all, the, secrets, of, sex, utu, complies, and, in, kur, inanna, tastes, the, fruit, and, becomes, knowledgeable, the, hymn, employs, the, same, motif, found, in, the, myth, of, enki, and, ninhursag, and, in, the, later, biblical, story, of, adam, and, eve, the, poem, inanna, prefers, the, farmer, etcsl, 4, 0, 8, 3, 3, begins, with, a, rather, playful, conversation, between, inanna, and, utu, who, incrementally, reveals, to, her, that, it, is, time, for, her, to, marry, she, is, courted, by, a, farmer, named, enkimdu, and, a, shepherd, named, dumuzid, at, first, inanna, prefers, the, farmer, but, utu, and, dumuzid, gradually, persuade, her, that, dumuzid, is, the, better, choice, for, a, husband, arguing, that, for, every, gift, the, farmer, can, give, to,

samuel, noah, kramer, compares, the, myth, to, the, later, biblical, story, of, cain, and, abel, because, both, myths, center, around, a, farmer, and, a, shepherd, competing, for, divine, favor, and, in, both, stories, the, deity, in, question, ultimately, chooses, the, shepherd, inanna, and, enki, etcsl, t, 1, 3, 1, is, a, lengthy, poem, written, in, sumerian, which, may, date, to, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, c, 2112, bce, c, 2004, bce, it, tells, the, story, of, how, inanna, stole, the, sacred, mes, from, enki, the, god, of, water, and, human, culture, in, ancient, sumerian, mythology, the, mes, were, sacred, powers, or, properties, belonging, to, the, gods, that, allowed, human, civilization, to, exist, each, me, embodied, one, specific, aspect, of, human, culture, these, aspects, were, very, diverse, and, the, mes, listed, in, the, poem, include, abstract, concepts, such, as, truth, victory, and, counsel, technologies, such, as, writing, and, weaving, and, also, social, constructs, such, as, law, priestly, offices, kingship, and, prostitution, the, mes, were, believed, to, grant, power, over, all, the, aspects, of, civilization, both, positive, and, negative, in, the, myth, inanna, travels, from, her, own, city, of, uruk, to, enki, s, city, of, eridu, where, she, visits, his, temple, the, e, abzu, inanna, is, greeted, by, enki, s, sukkal, isimud, who, offers, her, food, and, drink, inanna, starts, up, a, drinking, competition, with, enki, then, once, enki, is, thoroughly, intoxicated, inanna, persuades, him, to, give, her, the, mes, inanna, flees, from, eridu, in, the, boat, of, heaven, taking, the, mes, back, with, her, to, uruk, enki, wakes, up, to, discover, that, the, mes, are, gone, and, asks, isimud, what, has, happened, to, them, isimud, replies, that, enki, has, given, all, of, them, to, inanna, enki, becomes, infuriated, and, sends, multiple, sets, of, fierce, monsters, after, inanna, to, take, back, the, mes, before, she, reaches, the, city, of, uruk, inanna, s, sukkal, ninshubur, fends, off, all, of, the, monsters, that, enki, sends, after, them, through, ninshubur, s, aid, inanna, successfully, manages, to, take, the, mes, back, with, her, to, the, city, of, uruk, after, inanna, escapes, enki, reconciles, with, her, and, bids, her, a, positive, farewell, it, is, possible, that, this, legend, may, represent, a, historic, transfer, of, power, from, the, city, of, eridu, to, the, city, of, uruk, it, is, also, possible, that, this, legend, may, be, a, symbolic, representation, of, inanna, s, maturity, and, her, readiness, to, become, the, queen, of, heaven, the, poem, inanna, takes, command, of, heaven, is, an, extremely, fragmentary, but, important, account, of, inanna, s, conquest, of, the, eanna, temple, in, uruk, it, begins, with, a, conversation, between, inanna, and, her, brother, utu, in, which, inanna, laments, that, the, eanna, temple, is, not, within, their, domain, and, resolves, to, claim, it, as, her, own, the, text, becomes, increasingly, fragmentary, at, this, point, in, the, narrative, but, appears, to, describe, her, difficult, passage, through, a, marshland, to, reach, the, temple, while, a, fisherman, instructs, her, on, which, route, is, best, to, take, ultimately, inanna, reaches, her, father, an, who, is, shocked, by, her, arrogance, but, nevertheless, concedes, that, she, has, succeeded, and, that, the, temple, is, now, her, domain, the, text, ends, with, a, hymn, expounding, inanna, s, greatness, this, myth, may, represent, an, eclipse, in, the, authority, of, the, priests, of, an, in, uruk, and, a, transfer, of, power, to, the, priests, of, inanna, beside, the, epic, text, the, descent, of, the, eanna, from, heaven, is, mentioned, in, the, story, of,

available, to, him, inanna, who, is, the, patron, goddess, of, both, cities, appears, to, enmerkar, at, the, beginning, of, the, poem, and, tells, him, that, she, favors, uruk, over, aratta, she, instructs, enmerkar, to, send, a, messenger, to, the, lord, of, aratta, to, ask, for, the, resources, uruk, needs, the, majority, of, the, epic, revolves, around, a, great, contest, between, the, two,

her, brother, utu, were, regarded, as, the, dispensers, of, divine, justice, a, role, which, inanna, exemplifies, in, several, of, her, myths, inanna, and, ebih, etcsl, 1, 3, 2, otherwise, known, as,

she, explains, to, mount, ebih, why, she, attacked, it, in, sumerian, poetry, the, phrase, destroyer, of, kur, is, occasionally, used, as, one, of, inanna, s, epithets, according, to, annette, zgoll, in, this, text, inanna, represents, the, expansive, conquest, policy, of, the, akkadian, empire, while, the, reluctant, behaviour, of, the, god, an, represents, the, perspective, of, the, land, of, sumer, and, its, inhabitants, who, had, to, suffer, under, the, sargonid, invasions, the, rebellion, of, the, mountain, of, ebi, and, its, destruction, by, inanna, is, also, mentioned, in, the, hymn, innin, a, gura, mistress, of, the, great, heart, which, is, ascribed, to, the, high, priestess, en, edu, ana, the, poem, inanna, and, shukaletuda, etcsl, 1, 3, 3, begins, with, a, hymn, to, inanna, praising, her, as, the, planet, venus, it, then, introduces, shukaletuda, a, gardener, who, is, terrible, at, his, job, all, of, his, plants, die, except, for, one, poplar, tree, shukaletuda, prays, to, the, gods, for, guidance, in, his, work, to, his, surprise, the, goddess, inanna, sees, his, one, poplar, tree, and, decides, to, rest, under, the, shade, of, its, branches, shukaletuda, removes, her, clothes, and, rapes, inanna, while, she, sleeps, when, the, goddess, wakes, up, and, realizes, she, has, been, violated, she, becomes, furious, and, determines, to, bring, her, attacker, to,

asks, enki, to, help, her, find, him, threatening, to, leave, her, temple, in, uruk, if, he, does, not, enki, consents, and, inanna, flies, across, the, sky, like, a, rainbow, inanna, finally, locates, shukaletuda, who, vainly, attempts, to, invent, excuses, for, his, crime, against, her, inanna, rejects, these, excuses, and, kills, him, theology, professor, jeffrey, cooley, has, cited, the, story, of, shukaletuda, as, a, sumerian, astral, myth, arguing, that, the, movements, of, inanna, in, the, story, correspond, with, the, movements, of, the, planet, venus, he, has, also, stated, that, while, shukaletuda, was, praying, to, the, goddess, he, may, have, been, looking, toward, venus, on, the, horizon, the, text, of, the, poem, inanna, and, bilulu, etcsl, 1, 4, 4, discovered, at,

intelligible, part, of, the, poem, describes, inanna, pining, after, her, husband, dumuzid, who, is, in, the, steppe, watching, his, flocks, inanna, sets, out, to, find, him, after, this, a, large, portion, of, the, text, is, missing, when, the, story, resumes, inanna, is, being, told, that, dumuzid, has, been, murdered, inanna, discovers, that, the, old, bandit, woman, bilulu, and, her, son,

descent, into, the, underworld, have, survived, a, sumerian, version, dating, to, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, circa, 2112, bce, 2004, bce, etcsl, 1, 4, 1, and, a, clearly, derivative, akkadian, version, from, the, early, second, millennium, bce, the, sumerian, version, of, the, story, is, nearly, three, times, the, length, of, the, later, akkadian, version, and, contains, much, greater, detail, various, other, texts, refer, to, the, myth, of, inanna, s, descent, as, well, including, the, tale, of, inanna, and, ukaletuda, already, in, the, first, cuneiform, texts, of, late, 4th, millennium, uruk, period, the, divine, name, inanna, kur, inanna, of, the, netherworld, is, attested, which, probably, refers, to, the, underworld, passage, and, thus, makes, it, probably, the, oldest, reliably, attested, myth, of, mankind, in, sumerian, religion, the, kur, was, conceived, of, as, a, dark, dreary, cavern, located, deep, underground, life, there, was, envisioned, as, a, shadowy, version, of, life, on, earth, it, was, ruled, by, the, goddess, ereshkigal, who, is, referred, to, as, the, sister, of, inanna, the, text, itself, does, not, explicitly, state, the, motivation, of, inanna, s, descent, however, hylistic, myth, research, could, show, that, at, least, one, variant, of, the, myth, processed, in, the, text, relates, to, inanna, demanding, the, me, divine, powers, rituals, of, the, netherworld, in, which, she, finally, succeeds, before, leaving, inanna, instructs, her, minister, and, servant, ninshubur, to, plead, with, the, deities, enlil,

the, underworld, demanding, to, be, let, in, the, gatekeeper, neti, asks, her, why, she, has, come, and, inanna, replies, that, she, wishes, to, attend, the, funeral, rites, of, gugalanna, the, husband, of, my, elder, sister, ereshkigal, neti, reports, this, to, ereshkigal, who, tells, him, bolt, the, seven, gates, of, the, underworld, then, one, by, one, open, each, gate, a, crack, let,

instructs, them, to, appease, ereshkigal, and, when, she, asks, them, what, they, want, ask, for, the, corpse, of, inanna, which, they, must, sprinkle, with, the, food, and, water, of, life, when, they, come, before, ereshkigal, she, is, in, agony, like, a, woman, giving, birth, she, offers, them, whatever, they, want, including, life, giving, rivers, of, water, and, fields, of, grain, if, they, can, relieve, her, but, they, refuse, all, of, her, offers, and, ask, only, for, inanna, s, corpse, the, gala, tura, and, the, kur, jara, sprinkle, inanna, s, corpse, with, the, food, and, water, of, life, and, revive, her, the, sumerian, text, connects, the, myth, of, inanna, s, descent, with, one, variant, of, the, myth, concerning, the, death, of, dumuzi, galla, demons, sent, by, ereshkigal, follow, inanna, out, of, the, underworld, insisting, that, someone, else, must, be, taken, to, the, underworld, as, inanna, s, replacement, they, first, come, upon, ninshubur, and, attempt, to, take, her, but, inanna, stops, them, insisting, that, ninshubur, is, her, loyal, servant, and, that, she, had, rightfully, mourned, for, her, while, she, was, in, the, underworld, they, next, come, upon, shara, inanna, s, beautician, who, is, still, in, mourning, the, demons, attempt, to, take, him, but, inanna, insists, that, they, may, not, because, he, had, also, mourned, for, her, the, third, person, they, come, upon, is, lulal, who, is, also, in, mourning, the, demons, try, to, take, him, but, inanna, stops, them, once, again, finally, they, come, upon, dumuzi, inanna, s, husband, despite, inanna, s, fate, and, in, contrast, to, the, other, individuals, who, were, properly, mourning, her, dumuzi, is, lavishly, clothed, and, resting, beneath, a, tree, or, upon, her, throne, entertained, by, slave, girls, inanna, displeased, decrees, that, the, galla, shall, take, him, the, galla, then, drag, dumuzi, down, to, the, underworld, another, text, known, as, dumuzi, s, dream, etcsl, 1, 4, 3, describes, dumuzi, s, repeated, attempts, to, evade, capture, by, the, galla, demons, an, effort, in, which, he, is, aided, by, the, sun, god, utu, in, the, sumerian, poem, the, return, of, dumuzid, which, begins, where, the, dream, of, dumuzid, ends, dumuzid, s, sister, geshtinanna, laments, continually, for, days, and, nights, over, dumuzid, s, death, joined, by, inanna, who, has, apparently, experienced, a, change, of, heart, and, sirtur, dumuzid, s, mother, the, three, goddesses, mourn, continually, until, a, fly, reveals, to, inanna, the, location, of, her, husband, together, inanna, and, geshtinanna, go, to, the, place, where, the, fly, has, told, them, they, will, find, dumuzid, they, find, him, there, and, inanna, decrees, that, from, that, point, onwards, dumuzid, will, spend, half, of, the, year, with, her, sister, ereshkigal, in, the, underworld, and, the, other, half, of, the, year, in, heaven, with, her, while, his, sister, geshtinanna, takes, his, place, in, the, underworld, this, version, had, two, manuscripts, found, in, the, library, of, ashurbanipal, and, a, third, was, found, in, asshur, all, dating, from, the, first, half, of, the, first, millennium, before, the, common, era, of, the, ninevite, version, the, first, cuneiform, version, was, published, in, 1873, by, fran, ois, lenormant, and, the, transliterated, version, was, published, by, peter, jensen, in, 1901, its, title, in, akkadian, is, ana, kurnug, qaqqari, la, t, ri, the, akkadian, version, begins, with, ishtar, approaching, the, gates, of, the, underworld, and, demanding, the, gatekeeper, to, let, her, in, if, you, do, not, open, the, gate, for, me, to, come, in, i, shall, smash, the, door, and, shatter, the, bolt, i, shall, smash, the, doorpost, and, overturn, the, doors, i, shall, raise, up, the, dead, and, they, shall, eat, the, living, and, the, dead, shall, outnumber, the, living, the, gatekeeper, whose, name, is, not, given, in, the, akkadian, version, hurries, to, tell, ereshkigal, of, ishtar, s, arrival, ereshkigal, orders, him, to, let, ishtar, enter, but, tells, him, to, treat, her, according, to, the, ancient, rites, the, gatekeeper, lets, ishtar, into, the, underworld, opening, one, gate, at, a, time, at, each, gate, ishtar, is, forced, to, shed, one, article, of, clothing, when, she, finally, passes, the, seventh, gate, she, is, naked, in, a, rage, ishtar, throws, herself, at, ereshkigal, but, ereshkigal, orders, her, servant, namtar, to, imprison, ishtar, and, unleash, sixty, diseases, against, her, after, ishtar, descends, to, the, underworld, all, sexual, activity, ceases, on, earth, the, god, papsukkal, the, akkadian, counterpart, to, ninshubur, reports, the, situation, to, ea, the, god, of, wisdom, and, culture, ea, creates, an, androgynous, being, called, asu, shu, namir, and, sends, them, to, ereshkigal, telling, them, to, invoke, the, name, of, the, great, gods, against, her, and, to, ask, for, the, bag, containing, the, waters, of, life, ereshkigal, becomes, enraged, when, she, hears, asu, shu, namir, s, demand, but, she, is, forced, to, give, them, the, water, of, life, asu, shu, namir, sprinkles, ishtar, with, this, water, reviving, her, then, ishtar, passes, back, through, the, seven, gates, receiving, one, article, of, clothing, back, at, each, gate, and, exiting, the, final, gate, fully, clothed, but, i, tar, must, provide, a, substitute, for, her, return, to, the, world, of, the, living, namely, her, husband, dumuzi, his, sister, belili, however, takes, part, of, the, punishment, upon, herself, so, that, from, now, on, they, take, turns, in, the, underworld, together, with, dumuzi, the, other, dead, are, now, allowed, to, leave, the, underworld, on, certain, days, as, well, thus, i, tar, s, descent, into, the, underworld, has, created, an, opportunity, for, people, to, make, contact, with, the, dead, thus, founding, a, religious, holiday, dina, katz, an, authority, on, sumerian, afterlife, beliefs, and, funerary, customs, considers, the, narrative, of, inanna, s, descent, to, be, a, combination, of, two, distinct, preexisting, traditions, rooted, in, broader, context, of, mesopotamian, religion, in, one, tradition, inanna, was, only, able, to, leave, the, underworld, with, the, help, of, enki, s, trick, with, no, mention, of, the, possibility, of, finding, a, substitute, this, part, of, the, myth, belongs, to, the, genre, of, myths, about, deities, struggling, to, obtain, power, glory, etc, such, as, lugal, e, or, enuma, elish, and, possibly, served, as, a, representation, of, inanna, s, character, as, a, personification, of, a, periodically, vanishing, astral, body, according, to, katz, the, fact, that, inanna, s, instructions, to, ninshubur, contain, a, correct, prediction, of, her, eventual, fate, including, the, exact, means, of, her, rescue, show, that, the, purpose, of, this, composition, was, simply, highlighting, inanna, s, ability, to, traverse, both, the, heavens, and, the, underworld, much, like, how, venus, was, able, to, rise, over, and, over, again, she, also, points, out, inanna, s, return, has, parallels, in, some, udug, hul, incantations, another, was, simply, one, of, the, many, myths, about, the, death, of, dumuzi, such, as, dumuzi, s, dream, or, inana, and, bilulu, in, these, myths, inanna, is, not, to, blame, for, his, death, tied, to, his, role, as, an, embodiment, of, vegetation, she, considers, it, possible, that, the, connection, between, the, two, parts, of, the, narrative, was, meant, to, mirror, some, well, attested, healing, rituals, which, required, a, symbolic, substitute, of, the, person, being, treated, katz, also, notes, that, the, sumerian, version, of, the, myth, is, not, concerned, with, matters, of, fertility, and, points, out, any, references, to, it, e, g, to, nature, being, infertile, while, ishtar, is, dead, were, only, added, in, later, akkadian, translations, so, was, the, description, of, tammuz, s, funeral, the, purpose, of, these, changes, was, likely, to, make, the, myth, closer, to, cultic, traditions, linked, to, tammuz, namely, the, annual, mourning, of, his, death, followed, by, celebration, of, a, temporary, return, according, to, katz, it, is, notable, that, known, many, copies, of, the, later, versions, of, the, myth, come, from, assyrian, cities, which, were, known, for, their, veneration, of, tammuz, such, as, ashur, and, nineveh, a, number, of, less, scholarly, interpretations, of, the, myth, arose, through, the, 20th, century, many, of, them, rooted, in, the, tradition, of, jungian, analysis, rather, than, assyriology, some, authors, draw, comparisons, to, the, greek, myth, of, the, abduction, of, persephone, as, well, monica, otterrmann, performed, a, feminist, interpretation, of, the, myth, questioning, its, interpretation, as, related, to, the, cycle, of, nature, claiming, that, the, narratives, represent, that, inanna, s, powers, were, being, restricted, by, the, mesopotamian, patriarchy, due, to, the, fact, that, according, to, her, the, region, was, not, conducive, to, fertility, brand, o, questions, this, idea, in, part, for, although, inanna, s, power, is, at, stake, in, the, sumerian, text, in, the, akkadian, text, the, goddess, relationship, to, fertility, and, fertilization, is, at, stake, furthermore, in, the, sumerian, text, inanna, s, power, is, not, limited, by, a, man, but, by, another, equally, powerful, goddess, ereskigal, in, the, akkadian, epic, of, gilgamesh, ishtar, appears, to, gilgamesh, after, he, and, his, companion, enkidu, have, returned, to, uruk, from, defeating, the, ogre, humbaba, and, demands, gilgamesh, to, become, her, consort, gilgamesh, refuses, her, pointing, out, that, all, of, her, previous, lovers, have, suffered, listen, to, me, while, i, tell, the, tale, of, your, lovers, there, was, tammuz, the, lover, of, your, youth, for, him, you, decreed, wailing, year, after, year, you, loved, the, many, coloured, lilac, breasted, roller, but, still, you, struck, and, broke, his, wing, you, have, loved, the, lion, tremendous, in, strength, seven, pits, you, dug, for, him, and, seven, you, have, loved, the, stallion, magnificent, in, battle, and, for, him, you, decreed, the, whip, and, spur, and, a, thong, you, have, loved, the, shepherd, of, the, flock, he, made, meal, cake, for, you, day, after, day, he, killed, kids, for, your, sake, you, struck, and, turned, him, into, a, wolf, now, his, own, herd, boys, chase, him, away, his, own, hounds, worry, his, flanks, infuriated, by, gilgamesh, s, refusal, ishtar, goes, to, heaven, and, tells, her, father, anu, that, gilgamesh, has, insulted, her, anu, asks, her, why, she, is, complaining, to, him, instead, of, confronting, gilgamesh, herself, ishtar, demands, that, anu, give, her, the, bull, of, heaven, and, swears, that, if, he, does, not, give, it, to, her, she, will, break, in, the, doors, of, hell, and, smash, the, bolts, there, will, be, confusion, of, people, those, above, with, those, from, the, lower, depths, i, shall, bring, up, the, dead, to, eat, food, like, the, living, and, the, hosts, of, the, dead, will, outnumber, the, living, anu, gives, ishtar, the, bull, of, heaven, and, ishtar, sends, it, to, attack, gilgamesh, and, his, friend, enkidu, gilgamesh, and, enkidu, kill, the, bull, and, offer, its, heart, to, the, sun, god, shamash, while, gilgamesh, and, enkidu, are, resting, ishtar, stands, up, on, the, walls, of, uruk, and, curses, gilgamesh, enkidu, tears, off, the, bull, s, right, thigh, and, throws, it, in, ishtar, s, face, saying, if, i, could, lay, my, hands, on, you, it, is, this, i, should, do, to, you, and, lash, your, entrails, to, your, side, enkidu, later, dies, for, this, impiety, ishtar, calls, together, the, crimped, courtesans, prostitutes, and, harlots, and, orders, them, to, mourn, for, the, bull, of, heaven, meanwhile, gilgamesh, holds, a, celebration, over, the, bull, of, heaven, s, defeat, later, in, the, epic, utnapishtim, tells, gilgamesh, the, story, of, the, great, flood, which, was, sent, by, the, god, enlil, to, annihilate, all, life, on, earth, because, the, humans, who, were, vastly, overpopulated, made, too, much, noise, and, prevented, him, from, sleeping, utnapishtim, tells, how, when, the, flood, came, ishtar, wept, and, mourned, over, the, destruction, of, humanity, alongside, the, anunnaki, later, after, the, flood, subsides, utnapishtim, makes, an, offering, to, the, gods, ishtar, appears, to, utnapishtim, wearing, a, lapis, lazuli, necklace, with, beads, shaped, like, flies, and, tells, him, that, enlil, never, discussed, the, flood, with, any, of, the, other, gods, she, swears, him, that, she, will, never, allow, enlil, to, cause, another, flood, and, declares, her, lapis, lazuli, necklace, a, sign, of, her, oath, ishtar, invites, all, the, gods, except, for, enlil, to, gather, around, the, offering, and, enjoy, the, song, of, agushaya, an, akkadian, text, presumably, from, the, time, of, hammurapi, tells, a, myth, mixed, with, hymnic, passages, the, war, goddess, ishtar, is, filled, with, constant, wrath, and, plagues, the, earth, with, war, and, battle, with, her, roar, she, finally, even, threatens, the, wise, god, ea, in, aps, he, appears, before, the, assembly, of, gods, and, decides, similar, to, enkidu, in, the, epic, of, gilgame, to, create, an, equal, opponent, for, ishtar, from, the, dirt, of, his, fingernails, he, forms, the, powerful, goddess, altum, fight, quarrel, whom, he, instructs, to, confront, ishtar, disrespectfully, and, plague, her, day, and, night, with, her, roar, the, text, section, with, the, confrontation, of, both, goddesses, is, not, preserved, but, it, is, followed, by, a, scene, in, which, ishtar, demands, from, ea, to, call, altum, back, which, he, does, subsequently, ea, establishes, a, festival, in, which, henceforth, a, whirl, dance, g, t, is, to, be, performed, annually, in, commemoration, of, the, events, the, text, ends, with, the, statement, that, ishtar, s, heart, has, calmed, down, a, myth, about, the, childhood, of, the, god, ishum, viewed, as, a, son, of, shamash, describes, ishtar, seemingly, temporarily, taking, care, of, him, and, possibly, expressing, annoyance, at, that, situation, in, a, pseudepigraphical, neo, assyrian, text, written, in, the, seventh, century, bce, but, which, claims, to, be, the, autobiography, of, sargon, of, akkad, ishtar, is, claimed, to, have, appeared, to, sargon, surrounded, by, a, cloud, of, doves, while, he, was, working, as, a, gardener, for, akki, the, drawer, of, the, water, ishtar, then, proclaimed, sargon, her, lover, and, allowed, him, to, become, the, ruler, of, sumer, and, akkad, in, hurro, hittite, texts, the, logogram, d, ishtar, denotes, the, goddess, au, ka, who, was, identified, with, ishtar, in, god, lists, and, similar, documents, as, well, and, influenced, the, development, of, the, late, assyrian, cult, of, ishtar, of, nineveh, according, to, hittitologist, gary, beckman, she, plays, a, prominent, role, in, the, hurrian, myths, of, the, kumarbi, cycle, the, cult, of, inanna, ishtar, may, have, been, introduced, to, the, kingdom, of, judah, during, the, reign, of, king, manasseh, and, although, inanna, herself, is, not, directly, mentioned, in, the, bible, by, name, the, old, testament, contains, numerous, allusions, to, her, cult, jeremiah, 7, 18, and, jeremiah, 44, 15, 19, mention, the, queen, of, heaven, who, is, probably, a, syncretism, of, inanna, ishtar, and, the, west, semitic, goddess, astarte, jeremiah, states, that, the, queen, of, heaven, was, worshipped, by, women, who, baked, cakes, for, her, the, song, of, songs, bears, strong, similarities, to, the, sumerian, love, poems, involving, inanna, and, dumuzid, particularly, in, its, usage, of, natural, symbolism, to, represent, the, lovers, physicality, song, of, songs, 6, 10, ezekiel, 8, 14, mentions, inanna, s, husband, dumuzid, under, his, later, east, semitic, name, tammuz, and, describes, a, group, of, women, mourning, tammuz, s, death, while, sitting, near, the, north, gate, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, marina, warner, a, literary, critic, rather, than, assyriologist, claims, that, early, christians, in, the, middle, east, assimilated, elements, of, ishtar, into, the, cult, of, the, virgin, mary, she, argues, that, the, syrian, writers, jacob, of, serugh, and, romanos, the, melodist, both, wrote, laments, in, which, the, virgin, mary, describes, her, compassion, for, her, son, at, the, foot, of, the, cross, in, deeply, personal, terms, closely, resembling, ishtar, s, laments, over, the, death, of, tammuz, however, broad, comparisons, between, tammuz, and, other, dying, gods, are, rooted, in, the, work, of, james, george, frazer, and, are, regarded, as, a, relic, of, less, rigorous, early, 20th, century, assyriology, by, more, recent, publications, the, cult, of, inanna, ishtar, also, heavily, influenced, the, cult, of, the, phoenician, goddess, astarte, the, phoenicians, introduced, astarte, to, the, greek, islands, of, cyprus, and, cythera, where, she, either, gave, rise, to, or, at, least, heavily, influenced, the, greek, goddess, aphrodite, aphrodite, took, on, inanna, ishtar, s, associations, with, sexuality, and, procreation, furthermore, aphrodite, was, known, as, ourania, meaning, heavenly, corresponding, to, inanna, s, role, as, the, queen, of, heaven, early, artistic, and, literary, portrayals, of, aphrodite, are, extremely, similar, to, inanna, ishtar, aphrodite, was, also, a, warrior, goddess, the, second, century, ad, greek, geographer, pausanias, records, that, in, sparta, aphrodite, was, worshipped, as, aphrodite, areia, which, means, warlike, he, also, mentions, that, aphrodite, s, most, ancient, cult, statues, in, sparta, and, on, cythera, showed, her, bearing, arms, modern, scholars, note, that, aphrodite, s, warrior, goddess, aspects, appear, in, the, oldest, strata, of, her, worship, and, see, it, as, an, indication, of, her, near, eastern, origins, aphrodite, also, absorbed, ishtar, s, association, with, doves, which, were, sacrificed, to, her, alone, the, greek, word, for, dove, was, perister, which, may, be, derived, from, the, semitic, phrase, pera, i, tar, meaning, bird, of, ishtar, the, myth, of, aphrodite, and, adonis, is, derived, from, the, story, of, inanna, and, dumuzid, classical, scholar, charles, penglase, has, written, that, athena, the, greek, goddess, of, wisdom, and, war, resembles, inanna, s, role, as, a, terrifying, warrior, goddess, others, have, noted, that, the, birth, of, athena, from, the, head, of, her, father, zeus, could, be, derived, from, inanna, s, descent, into, and, return, from, the, underworld, however, as, noted, by, gary, beckman, a, rather, direct, parallel, to, athena, s, birth, is, found, in, the, hurrian, kumarbi, cycle, where, teshub, is, born, from, the, surgically, split, skull, of, kumarbi, rather, than, in, any, inanna, myths, in, mandaean, cosmology, one, of, the, names, for, venus, is, stira, which, is, derived, from, the, name, ishtar, anthropologist, kevin, tuite, argues, that, the, georgian, goddess, dali, was, also, influenced, by, inanna, noting, that, both, dali, and, inanna, were, associated, with, the, morning, star, both, were, characteristically, depicted, nude, but, assyriologists, assume, the, naked, goddess, motif, in, mesopotamian, art, in, most, cases, cannot, be, ishtar, and, the, goddess, most, consistently, depicted, as, naked, was, shala, a, weather, goddess, unrelated, to, ishtar, both, were, associated, with, gold, jewelry, both, sexually, preyed, on, mortal, men, both, were, associated, with, human, and, animal, fertility, note, however, that, assyriologist, dina, katz, pointed, out, the, references, to, fertility, are, more, likely, to, be, connected, to, dumuzi, than, inanna, ishtar, in, at, least, some, cases, and, both, had, ambiguous, natures, as, sexually, attractive, but, dangerous, women, traditional, mesopotamian, religion, gradually, began, to, decline, between, the, third, and, fifth, centuries, ad, as, ethnic, assyrians, converted, to, christianity, nonetheless, the, cult, of, ishtar, and, tammuz, managed, to, survive, in, parts, of, upper, mesopotamia, in, the, tenth, century, ad, an, arab, traveler, wrote, that, all, the, sabaeans, of, our, time, those, of, babylonia, as, well, as, those, of, harran, lament, and, weep, to, this, day, over, tammuz, at, a, festival, which, they, more, particularly, the, women, hold, in, the, month, of, the, same, name, worship, of, venus, deities, possibly, connected, to, inanna, ishtar, was, known, in, pre, islamic, arabia, right, up, until, the, islamic, period, isaac, of, antioch, d, 406, ad, said, that, the, arabs, worshipped, the, star, kawkabta, also, known, as, al, uzza, which, many, identify, with, venus, isaac, also, mentions, an, arabian, deity, named, baltis, which, according, to, jan, rets, most, likely, was, another, designation, for, ishtar, in, pre, islamic, arabian, inscriptions, themselves, it, appears, that, the, deity, known, as, allat, was, also, a, venusian, deity, attar, a, male, god, whose, name, is, a, cognate, of, ishtar, s, is, a, plausible, candidate, for, the, role, of, arabian, venus, deity, too, on, the, account, of, both, his, name, and, his, epithet, eastern, and, western, in, his, 1853, pamphlet, the, two, babylons, as, part, of, his, argument, that, roman, catholicism, is, actually, babylonian, paganism, in, disguise, alexander, hislop, a, protestant, minister, in, the, free, church, of, scotland, incorrectly, argued, that, the, modern, english, word, easter, must, be, derived, from, ishtar, due, to, the, phonetic, similarity, of, the, two, words, modern, scholars, have, unanimously, rejected, hislop, s, arguments, as, erroneous, and, based, on, a, flawed, understanding, of, babylonian, religion, nonetheless, hislop, s, book, is, still, popular, among, some, groups, of, evangelical, protestants, and, the, ideas, promoted, in, it, have, become, widely, circulated, especially, through, the, internet, due, to, a, number, of, popular, internet, memes, ishtar, had, a, major, appearance, in, ishtar, and, izdubar, a, book, length, poem, written, in, 1884, by, leonidas, le, cenci, hamilton, an, american, lawyer, and, businessman, loosely, based, on, the, recently, translated, epic, of, gilgamesh, ishtar, and, izdubar, expanded, the, original, roughly, 3, 000, lines, of, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, to, roughly, 6, 000, lines, of, rhyming, couplets, grouped, into, forty, eight, cantos, hamilton, significantly, altered, most, of, the, characters, and, introduced, entirely, new, episodes, not, found, in, the, original, epic, significantly, influenced, by, edward, fitzgerald, s, rubaiyat, of, omar, khayyam, and, edwin, arnold, s, the, light, of, asia, hamilton, s, characters, dress, more, like, nineteenth, century, turks, than, ancient, babylonians, in, the, poem, izdubar, the, earlier, misreading, for, the, name, gilgamesh, falls, in, love, with, ishtar, but, then, with, hot, and, balmy, breath, and, trembling, form, aglow, she, attempts, to, seduce, him, leading, izdubar, to, reject, her, advances, several, columns, of, the, book, are, devoted, to, an, account, of, ishtar, s, descent, into, the, underworld, at, the, conclusion, of, the, book, izdubar, now, a, god, is, reconciled, with, ishtar, in, heaven, in, 1887, the, composer, vincent, d, indy, wrote, symphony, ishtar, variations, symphonique, op, 42, a, symphony, inspired, by, the, assyrian, monuments, in, the, british, museum, inanna, has, become, an, important, figure, in, modern, feminist, theory, because, she, appears, in, the, male, dominated, sumerian, pantheon, but, is,
