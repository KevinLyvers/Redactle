tantric, era, of, medieval, india, c, the, 5th, century, ce, onwards, however, traditionally, the, adherents, and, texts, of, vajray, na, claim, these, teachings, have, been, passed, down, by, an, unbroken, lineage, going, back, to, the, historical, buddha, c, the, 5th, century, bce, or, to, other, mythical, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, e, g, vajrapani, according, to, vajray, na, scriptures,

occultist, writers, such, as, helena, blavatsky, and, alfred, percy, sinnett, to, describe, theosophical, doctrines, passed, down, from, supposedly, initiated, buddhist, masters, tantric, buddhism, is, associated, with, groups, of, wandering, yogis, called, mahasiddhas, in, medieval, india, according, to, robert, thurman, these, tantric, figures, thrived, during, the, latter, half, of, the, first, millennium, ce, according, to, john, myrdhin, reynolds, the, mahasiddhas, date, to, the, medieval, period, in, north, india, and, used, methods, that, were, radically, different, from, those, used, in, buddhist, monasteries, including, practicing, on, charnel, grounds, since, the, practice, of, tantra, focuses, on, the, transformation, of, poisons, into, wisdom, the, yogic, circles, came, together, in, tantric, feasts, often, in, sacred, sites, pitha, and, places, ksetra, which, included, dancing, singing, consort, practices, and, the, ingestion, of, taboo, substances, like, alcohol, urine, and, meat, at, least, two, of, the, mahasiddhas, cited, in, the, buddhist, literature, are, comparable, with, the, shaiva, nath, saints, gorakshanath, and, matsyendranath, who, practiced, hatha, yoga, according, to, schumann, a, movement, called, sahaja, siddhi, developed, in, the, 8th, century, in, bengal, it, was, dominated, by, long, haired, wandering, mahasiddhas, who, openly, challenged, and, ridiculed, the, buddhist, establishment, the, mahasiddhas, pursued, siddhis, magical, powers, such, as, flight, and, extrasensory, perception, as, well, as, spiritual, liberation, ronald, m, davidson, states, that, buddhist, siddhas, demonstrated, the, appropriation, of, an, older, sociological, form, the, independent, sage, magician, who, lived, in, a, liminal, zone, on, the, borders, between, fields, and, forests, their, rites, involved, the, conjunction, of, sexual, practices, and, buddhist, mandala, visualization, with, ritual, accoutrements, made, from, parts, of, the, human, body, so, that, control, may, be, exercised, over, the, forces, hindering, the, natural, abilities, of, the, siddha, to, manipulate, the, cosmos, at, will, at, their, most, extreme, siddhas, also, represented, a, defensive, position, within, the, buddhist, tradition, adopted, and, sustained, for, the, purpose, of, aggressive, engagement, with, the, medieval, culture, of, public, violence, they, reinforced, their, reputations, for, personal, sanctity, with, rumors, of, the, magical, manipulation, of, various, flavors, of, demonic, females, dakini, yaksi, yogini, cemetery, ghouls, vetala, and, other, things, that, go, bump, in, the, night, operating, on, the, margins, of, both, monasteries, and, polite, society, some, adopted, the, behaviors, associated, with, ghosts, preta, pisaca, not, only, as, a, religious, praxis, but, also, as, an, extension, of, their, implied, threats, many, of, the, elements, found, in, buddhist, tantric, literature, are, not, wholly, new, earlier, mah, y, na, sutras, already, contained, some, elements, which, are, emphasized, in, the, tantras, such, as, mantras, and, dharani, the, use, of, protective, verses, or, phrases, actually, dates, back, to, the, vedic, period, and, can, be, seen, in, the, early, buddhist, texts, where, they, are, termed, paritta, the, practice, of, visualization, of, buddhas, such, as, amit, bha, is, also, seen, in, pre, tantric, texts, like, the, longer, sukh, vat, vy, ha, s, tra, there, are, other, mah, y, na, sutras, which, contain, proto, tantric, material, such, as, the, gandavyuha, and, the, dasabhumika, which, might, have, served, as, a, central, source, of, visual, imagery, for, tantric, texts, later, mah, y, na, texts, like, the, k, ra, avy, ha, s, tra, c, 4th, 5th, century, ce, expound, the, use, of, mantras, such, as, om, mani, padme, hum, associated, with, vastly, powerful, beings, like, avalokiteshvara, the, popular, heart, sutra, also, includes, a, mantra, vajray, na, buddhists, developed, a, large, corpus, of, texts, called, the, buddhist, tantras, some, of, which, can, be, traced, to, at, least, the, 7th, century, ce, but, might, be, older, the, dating, of, the, tantras, is, a, difficult, indeed, an, impossible, task, according, to, david, snellgrove, some, of, the, earliest, of, these, texts, kriya, tantras, such, as, the, ma, ju, r, m, la, kalpa, c, 6th, century, teach, the, use, of, mantras, and, dharanis, for, mostly, worldly, ends, including, curing, illness, controlling, the, weather, and, generating, wealth, the, tattvasa, graha, tantra, compendium, of, principles, classed, as, a, yoga, tantra, is, one, of, the, first, buddhist, tantras, which, focuses, on, liberation, as, opposed, to, worldly, goals, in, another, early, tantra, the, vajrasekhara, vajra, peak, the, influential, schema, of, the, five, buddha, families, is, developed, other, early, tantras, include, the, mah, vairocana, abhisa, bodhi, and, the, guhyasam, ja, gathering, of, secrets, the, guhyasam, ja, is, a, mahayoga, class, of, tantra, which, features, forms, of, ritual, practice, considered, left, hand, vamachara, such, as, the, use, of, taboo, substances, like, alcohol, consort, practices, and, charnel, ground, practices, which, evoke, wrathful, deities, ryujun, tajima, divides, the, tantras, into, those, which, were, a, development, of, mah, y, nist, thought, and, those, formed, in, a, rather, popular, mould, toward, the, end, of, the, eighth, century, and, declining, into, the, esoterism, of, the, left, this, left, esoterism, mainly, refers, to, the, yogini, tantras, and, later, works, associated, with, wandering, yogis, this, practice, survives, in, tibetan, buddhism, but, it, is, rare, for, this, to, be, done, with, an, actual, person, it, is, more, common, for, a, yogi, or, yogini, to, use, an, imagined, consort, a, buddhist, tantric, deity, i, e, a, yidam, these, later, tantras, such, as, the, hevajra, tantra, and, the, chakrasamvara, are, classed, as, yogini, tantras, and, represent, the, final, form, of, development, of, indian, buddhist, tantras, in, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, the, kalachakra, tantra, developed, in, the, 10th, century, it, is, farthest, removed, from, the, earlier, buddhist, traditions, and, incorporates, concepts, of, messianism, and, astrology, not, present, elsewhere, in, buddhist, literature, according, to, ronald, m, davidson, the, rise, of, tantric, buddhism, was, a, response, to, the, feudal, structure, of, indian, society, in, the, early, medieval, period, ca, 500, 1200, ce, which, saw, kings, being, divinized, as, manifestations, of, gods, likewise, tantric, yogis, reconfigured, their, practice, through, the, metaphor, of, being, consecrated, abhi, eka, as, the, overlord, r, j, dhir, ja, of, a, mandala, palace, of, divine, vassals, an, imperial, metaphor, symbolizing, kingly, fortresses, and, their, political, power, the, question, of, the, origins, of, early, vajray, na, has, been, taken, up, by, various, scholars, david, seyfort, ruegg, has, suggested, that, buddhist, tantra, employed, various, elements, of, a, pan, indian, religious, substrate, which, is, not, specifically, buddhist, shaiva, or, vaishnava, according, to, alexis, sanderson, various, classes, of, vajray, na, literature, developed, as, a, result, of, royal, courts, sponsoring, both, buddhism, and, shaivism, the, relationship, between, the, two, systems, can, be, seen, in, texts, like, the, ma, jusrimulakalpa, which, later, came, to, be, classified, under, kriya, tantra, and, states, that, mantras, taught, in, the, shaiva, garuda, and, vaishnava, tantras, will, be, effective, if, applied, by, buddhists, since, they, were, all, taught, originally, by, manjushri, sanderson, notes, that, the, vajray, na, yogini, tantras, draw, extensively, from, the, material, also, present, in, shaiva, bhairava, tantras, classified, as, vidyapitha, sanderson, s, comparison, of, them, shows, similarity, in, ritual, procedures, style, of, observance, deities, mantras, mandalas, ritual, dress, kapalika, accouterments, like, skull, bowls, specialized, terminology, secret, gestures, and, secret, jargons, there, is, even, direct, borrowing, of, passages, from, shaiva, texts, sanderson, gives, numerous, examples, such, as, the, guhyasiddhi, of, padmavajra, a, work, associated, with, the, guhyasamaja, tradition, which, prescribes, acting, as, a, shaiva, guru, and, initiating, members, into, saiva, siddhanta, scriptures, and, mandalas, sanderson, says, that, the, samvara, tantra, texts, adopted, the, pitha, list, from, the, shaiva, text, tantrasadbh, va, introducing, a, copying, error, where, a, deity, was, mistaken, for, a, place, ronald, m, davidson, meanwhile, argues, that, sanderson, s, arguments, for, direct, influence, from, shaiva, vidyapitha, texts, are, problematic, because, the, chronology, of, the, vidyapitha, tantras, is, by, no, means, so, well, established, and, that, the, available, evidence, suggests, that, received, saiva, tantras, come, into, evidence, sometime, in, the, ninth, to, tenth, centuries, with, their, affirmation, by, scholars, like, abhinavagupta, c, 1000, c, e, davidson, also, notes, that, the, list, of, pithas, or, sacred, places, are, certainly, not, particularly, buddhist, nor, are, they, uniquely, kapalika, venues, despite, their, presence, in, lists, employed, by, both, traditions, davidson, further, adds, that, like, the, buddhists, the, shaiva, tradition, was, also, involved, in, the, appropriation, of, hindu, and, non, hindu, deities, texts, and, traditions, an, example, being, village, or, tribal, divinities, like, tumburu, davidson, adds, that, buddhists, and, kapalikas, as, well, as, other, ascetics, possibly, pasupatas, mingled, and, discussed, their, paths, at, various, pilgrimage, places, and, that, there, were, conversions, between, the, different, groups, thus, he, concludes, the, buddhist, kapalika, connection, is, more, complex, than, a, simple, process, of, religious, imitation, and, textual, appropriation, there, can, be, no, question, that, the, buddhist, tantras, were, heavily, influenced, by, kapalika, and, other, saiva, movements, but, the, influence, was, apparently, mutual, perhaps, a, more, nuanced, model, would, be, that, the, various, lines, of, transmission, were, locally, flourishing, and, that, in, some, areas, they, interacted, while, in, others, they, maintained, concerted, hostility, thus, the, influence, was, both, sustained, and, reciprocal, even, in, those, places, where, buddhist, and, kapalika, siddhas, were, in, extreme, antagonism, davidson, also, argues, for, the, influence, of, non, brahmanical, and, outcaste, tribal, religions, and, their, feminine, deities, such, as, parnasabari, and, janguli, according, to, several, buddhist, tantras, as, well, as, traditional, tibetan, buddhist, sources, the, tantras, and, the, vajrayana, was, taught, by, the, buddha, shakyamuni, but, only, to, some, individuals, there, are, several, stories, and, versions, of, how, the, tantras, were, disseminated, the, j, ana, tilaka, tantra, for, example, has, the, buddha, state, that, the, tantras, will, be, explained, by, the, bodhisattva, vajrapani, one, of, the, most, famous, legends, is, that, of, king, indrabhuti, also, known, as, king, ja, of, oddiyana, a, figure, related, to, vajrapani, in, some, cases, said, to, be, an, emanation, of, him, other, accounts, attribute, the, revelation, of, buddhist, tantras, to, padmasambhava, saying, that, he, was, an, emanation, of, amitabha, and, avaloketishvara, and, that, his, arrival, was, predicted, by, the, buddha, some, accounts, also, maintain, padmasambhava, is, a, direct, reincarnation, of, buddha, shakyamuni, according, to, alex, wayman, the, philosophical, view, of, the, vajrayana, is, based, on, mahayana, buddhist, philosophy, mainly, the, madhyamaka, and, yogacara, schools, the, major, difference, seen, by, vajrayana, thinkers, is, the, superiority, of, tantric, methods, which, provide, a, faster, vehicle, to, liberation, and, contain, many, more, skillful, means, upaya, the, importance, of, the, theory, of, emptiness, is, central, to, the, tantric, buddhist, view, and, practice, the, buddhist, emptiness, view, sees, the, world, as, being, fluid, without, an, ontological, foundation, or, inherent, existence, but, ultimately, a, fabric, of, constructions, because, of, this, tantric, practice, such, as, self, visualization, as, the, deity, is, seen, as, being, no, less, real, than, everyday, reality, but, a, process, of, transforming, reality, itself, including, the, practitioner, s, identity, as, the, deity, as, stephan, beyer, notes, in, a, universe, where, all, events, dissolve, ontologically, into, emptiness, the, touching, of, emptiness, in, the, ritual, is, the, re, creation, of, the, world, in, actuality, the, doctrine, of, buddha, nature, as, outlined, in, the, ratnagotravibh, ga, of, asanga, was, also, an, important, theory, which, became, the, basis, for, tantric, views, as, explained, by, the, tantric, commentator, lilavajra, this, intrinsic, secret, behind, diverse, manifestation, is, the, utmost, secret, and, aim, of, tantra, according, to, wayman, this, buddha, embryo, tath, gatagarbha, is, a, non, dual, self, originated, wisdom, jnana, an, effortless, fount, of, good, qualities, that, resides, in, the, mindstream, but, is, obscured, by, discursive, thought, this, doctrine, is, often, associated, with, the, idea, of, the, inherent, or, natural, luminosity, skt, prak, ti, prabh, svara, citta, t, od, gsal, gyi, sems, or, purity, of, the, mind, prakrti, parisuddha, another, fundamental, theory, of, tantric, practice, is, that, of, transformation, in, vajray, na, negative, mental, factors, such, as, desire, hatred, greed, pride, are, used, as, part, of, the, path, as, noted, by, french, indologist, madeleine, biardeau, the, tantric, doctrine, is, an, attempt, to, place, kama, desire, in, every, meaning, of, the, word, in, the, service, of, liberation, this, view, is, outlined, in, the, following, quote, from, the, hevajra, tantra, those, things, by, which, evil, men, are, bound, others, turn, into, means, and, gain, thereby, release, from, the, bonds, of, existence, by, passion, the, world, is, bound, by, passion, too, it, is, released, but, by, heretical, buddhists, this, practice, of, reversals, is, not, known, the, hevajra, further, states, that, one, knowing, the, nature, of, poison, may, dispel, poison, with, poison, as, snellgrove, notes, this, idea, is, already, present, in, asanga, s, mahayana, sutra, alamkara, karika, and, therefore, it, is, possible, that, he, was, aware, of, tantric, techniques, including, sexual, yoga, according, to, buddhist, tantra, there, is, no, strict, separation, of, the, profane, or, samsara, and, the, sacred, or, nirvana, rather, they, exist, in, a, continuum, all, individuals, are, seen, as, containing, the, seed, of, enlightenment, within, which, is, covered, over, by, defilements, douglas, duckworth, notes, that, vajrayana, sees, buddhahood, not, as, something, outside, or, an, event, in, the, future, but, as, immanently, present, indian, tantric, buddhist, philosophers, such, as, buddhaguhya, vimalamitra, ratn, kara, nti, and, abhayakaragupta, continued, the, tradition, of, buddhist, philosophy, and, adapted, it, to, their, commentaries, on, the, major, tantras, abhayakaragupta, s, vajravali, is, a, key, source, in, the, theory, and, practice, of, tantric, rituals, after, monks, such, as, vajrabodhi, and, ubhakarasi, ha, brought, tantra, to, tang, china, 716, to, 720, tantric, philosophy, continued, to, be, developed, in, chinese, and, japanese, by, thinkers, such, as, yi, xing, and, k, kai, likewise, in, tibet, sakya, pandita, 1182, 28, 1251, as, well, as, later, thinkers, like, longchenpa, 1308, 1364, expanded, on, these, philosophies, in, their, tantric, commentaries, and, treatises, the, status, of, the, tantric, view, continued, to, be, debated, in, medieval, tibet, tibetan, buddhist, rongzom, chokyi, zangpo, 1012, 1088, held, that, the, views, of, sutra, such, as, madhyamaka, were, inferior, to, that, of, tantra, which, was, based, on, basic, purity, of, ultimate, reality, tsongkhapa, 1357, 1419, on, the, other, hand, held, that, there, is, no, difference, between, vajray, na, and, other, forms, of, mahayana, in, terms, of, prajnaparamita, perfection, of, insight, itself, only, that, vajray, na, is, a, method, which, works, faster, various, classifications, are, possible, when, distinguishing, vajray, na, from, the, other, buddhist, traditions, vajray, na, can, be, seen, as, a, third, yana, next, to, r, vakay, na, and, mahayana, vajray, na, can, be, distinguished, from, the, sutrayana, the, sutrayana, is, the, method, of, perfecting, good, qualities, where, the, vajray, na, is, the, method, of, taking, the, intended, outcome, of, buddhahood, as, the, path, vajray, na, can, also, be, distinguished, from, the, paramitayana, according, to, this, schema, indian, mahayana, revealed, two, vehicles, yana, or, methods, for, attaining, enlightenment, the, method, of, the, perfections, paramitayana, and, the, method, of, mantra, mantrayana, the, paramitayana, consists, of, the, six, or, ten, paramitas, of, which, the, scriptures, say, that, it, takes, three, incalculable, aeons, to, lead, one, to, buddhahood, the, tantra, literature, however, says, that, the, mantrayana, leads, one, to, buddhahood, in, a, single, lifetime, according, to, the, literature, the, mantra, is, an, easy, path, without, the, difficulties, innate, to, the, paramitayana, mantrayana, is, sometimes, portrayed, as, a, method, for, those, of, inferior, abilities, however, the, practitioner, of, the, mantra, still, has, to, adhere, to, the, vows, of, the, bodhisattva, the, goal, of, spiritual, practice, within, the, mahayana, and, vajray, na, traditions, is, to, become, a, samm, sambuddha, fully, awakened, buddha, those, on, this, path, are, termed, bodhisattvas, as, with, the, mahayana, motivation, is, a, vital, component, of, vajray, na, practice, the, bodhisattva, path, is, an, integral, part, of, the, vajray, na, which, teaches, that, all, practices, are, to, be, undertaken, with, the, motivation, to, achieve, buddhahood, for, the, benefit, of, all, sentient, beings, in, the, vehicle, of, sutra, mahayana, the, path, of, the, cause, is, taken, whereby, a, practitioner, starts, with, his, or, her, potential, buddha, nature, and, nurtures, it, to, produce, the, fruit, of, buddhahood, in, the, vajray, na, the, path, of, the, fruit, is, taken, whereby, the, practitioner, takes, his, or, her, innate, buddha, nature, as, the, means, of, practice, the, premise, is, that, since, we, innately, have, an, enlightened, mind, practicing, seeing, the, world, in, terms, of, ultimate, truth, can, help, us, to, attain, our, full, buddha, nature, experiencing, ultimate, truth, is, said, to, be, the, purpose, of, all, the, various, tantric, techniques, practiced, in, the, vajrayana, vajray, na, buddhism, is, esoteric, in, the, sense, that, the, transmission, of, certain, teachings, only, occurs, directly, from, teacher, to, student, during, an, empowerment, abhi, eka, and, their, practice, requires, initiation, in, a, ritual, space, containing, the, mandala, of, the, deity, many, techniques, are, also, commonly, said, to, be, secret, but, some, vajrayana, teachers, have, responded, that, secrecy, itself, is, not, important, and, only, a, side, effect, of, the, reality, that, the, techniques, have, no, validity, outside, the, teacher, student, lineage, the, secrecy, of, teachings, was, often, protected, through, the, use, of, allusive, indirect, symbolic, and, metaphorical, language, twilight, language, which, required, interpretation, and, guidance, from, a, teacher, the, teachings, may, also, be, considered, self, secret, meaning, that, even, if, they, were, to, be, told, directly, to, a, person, that, person, would, not, necessarily, understand, the, teachings, without, proper, context, in, this, way, the, teachings, are, secret, to, the, minds, of, those, who, are, not, following, the, path, with, more, than, a, simple, sense, of, curiosity, because, of, their, role, in, giving, access, to, the, practices, and, guiding, the, student, through, them, the, role, of, the, vajracharya, lama, is, indispensable, in, vajray, na, some, vajray, na, rituals, traditionally, included, the, use, of, certain, taboo, substances, such, as, blood, semen, alcohol, and, urine, as, ritual, offerings, and, sacraments, though, some, of, these, are, often, replaced, with, less, taboo, substances, such, as, yogurt, tantric, feasts, and, initiations, sometimes, employed, substances, like, human, flesh, as, noted, by, kahha, s, yogaratnamala, the, use, of, these, substances, is, related, to, the, non, dual, advaya, nature, of, a, buddha, s, wisdom, buddhaj, ana, since, the, ultimate, state, is, in, some, sense, non, dual, a, practitioner, can, approach, that, state, by, transcending, attachment, to, dual, categories, such, as, pure, and, impure, permitted, and, forbidden, as, the, guhyasamaja, tantra, states, the, wise, man, who, does, not, discriminate, achieves, buddhahood, vajray, na, rituals, also, include, sexual, yoga, union, with, a, physical, consort, as, part, of, advanced, practices, some, tantras, go, further, the, hevajra, tantra, states, you, should, kill, living, beings, speak, lying, words, take, what, is, not, given,

field, along, with, consorts, and, attendant, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, according, to, the, tibetan, scholar, tsongkhapa, deity, yoga, is, what, separates, tantra, from, sutra, practice, in, the, unsurpassed, yoga, tantras, the, most, widespread, tantric, form, in, indo, tibetan, buddhism, this, method, is, divided, into, two, stages, the, generation, stage, utpatti, krama, and, the, completion, stage, nispanna, krama, in, the, generation, stage, one, dissolves, one, s, reality, into, emptiness, and, meditates, on, the, deity, mandala, resulting, in, identification, with, this, divine, reality, in, the, completion, stage, the, divine, image, along, with, the, illusory, body, is, applied, to, the, realization, of, luminous, emptiness, this, dissolution, into, emptiness, is, then, followed, by, the, visualization, of, the, deity, and, re, emergence, of, the, yogi, as, the, deity, during, the, process, of, deity, visualization, the, deity, is, to, be, imaged, as, not, solid, or, tangible, as, empty, yet, apparent, with, the, character, of, a, mirage, or, a, rainbow, this, visualization, is, to, be, combined, with, divine, pride, which, is, the, thought, that, one, is, oneself, the, deity, being, visualized, divine, pride, is, different, from, common, pride, because, it, is, based, on, compassion, for, others, and, on, an, understanding, of, emptiness, the, tibetologist, david, germano, outlines, two, main, types, of, completion, practice, a, formless, and, image, less, contemplation, on, the, ultimate, empty, nature, of, the, mind, and, various, yogas, that, make, use, of, the, illusory, body, to, produce, energetic, sensations, of, bliss, and, warmth, the, illusory, body, yogas, systems, like, the, six, dharmas, of, naropa, and, the, six, yogas, of, kalachakra, make, use, of, energetic, schemas, of, human, psycho, physiology, composed, of, energy, channels, skt, nadi, tib, rtsa, winds, or, currents, skt, vayu, tib, rlung, drops, or, charged, particles, skt, bindu, tib, thig, le, and, chakras, wheels, these, subtle, energies, are, seen, as, mounts, for, consciousness, the, physical, component, of, awareness, they, are, engaged, by, various, means, such, as, pranayama, breath, control, to, produce, blissful, experiences, that, are, then, applied, to, the, realization, of, ultimate, reality, other, methods, which, are, associated, with, the, completion, stage, in, tibetan, buddhism, include, dream, yoga, which, relies, on, lucid, dreaming, practices, associated, with, the, bardo, the, interim, state, between, death, and, rebirth, transference, of, consciousness, phowa, and, ch, d, in, which, the, yogi, ceremonially, offers, their, body, to, be, eaten, by, tantric, deities, in, a, ritual, feast, another, form, of, vajrayana, practice, are, certain, meditative, techniques, associated, with, mah, mudr, and, dzogchen, often, termed, formless, practices, or, the, path, of, self, liberation, these, techniques, do, not, rely, on, deity, visualization, per, se, but, on, direct, pointing, out, instruction, from, a, master, and, are, often, seen, as, the, most, advanced, and, direct, methods, another, distinctive, feature, of, tantric, buddhism, is, its, unique, and, often, elaborate, rituals, they, include, pujas, worship, rituals, prayer, festivals, protection, rituals, death, rituals, tantric, feasts, ganachakra, tantric, initiations, abhiseka, and, the, goma, fire, ritual, common, in, east, asian, esotericism, an, important, element, in, some, of, these, rituals, particularly, initiations, and, tantric, feasts, seems, to, have, been, the, practice, of, ritual, sex, or, sexual, yoga, karmamudra, desire, seal, also, referred, to, as, consort, observance, vidyavrata, and, euphemistically, as, puja, as, well, as, the, sacramental, ingestion, of, power, substances, such, as, the, mingled, sexual, fluids, and, uterine, blood, often, performed, by, licking, these, substances, off, the, vulva, a, practice, termed, yonipuja, the, practice, of, ingestion, of, sexual, fluids, is, mentioned, by, numerous, tantric, commentators, sometimes, euphemistically, referring, to, the, penis, as, the, vajra, and, the, vagina, as, the, lotus, the, cakrasamvara, tantra, commentator, kambala, writing, about, this, practice, states, the, seats, are, well, known, on, earth, to, be, spots, within, the, lotus, mandala, by, abiding, within, it, there, is, great, bliss, the, royal, nature, of, nondual, joy, therefore, the, lotus, seat, is, supreme, filled, with, a, mixture, of, semen, and, uterine, blood, one, should, especially, kiss, it, and, lolling, with, the, tongue, take, it, up, unite, the, vajra, and, lotus, with, the, rapture, of, drinking, liquor, according, to, david, gray, these, sexual, practices, probably, originated, in, a, non, monastic, context, but, were, later, adopted, by, monastic, establishments, such, as, nalanda, and, vikramashila, he, notes, that, the, anxiety, of, figures, like, atisa, towards, these, practices, and, the, stories, of, vir, pa, and, maitripa, being, expelled, from, their, monasteries, for, performing, them, shows, that, supposedly, celibate, monastics, were, undertaking, these, sexual, rites, because, of, its, adoption, by, the, monastic, tradition, the, practice, of, sexual, yoga, was, slowly, transformed, into, one, which, was, either, done, with, an, imaginary, consort, visualized, by, the, yogi, instead, of, an, actual, person, or, reserved, to, a, small, group, of, the, highest, or, elite, practitioners, likewise, the, drinking, of, sexual, fluids, was, also, reinterpreted, by, later, commentators, to, refer, illusory, body, anatomy, of, the, perfection, stage, practices, vajray, na, uses, a, rich, variety, of, symbols, terms, and, images, that, have, multiple, meanings, according, to, a, complex, system, of, analogical, thinking, in, vajray, na, symbols, and, terms, are, multi, valent, reflecting, the, microcosm, and, the, macrocosm, as, in, the, phrase, as, without, so, within, yatha, bahyam, tatha, dhyatmam, iti, from, abhayakaragupta, s, nispannayogavali, the, sanskrit, term, vajra, denoted, a, thunderbolt, like, a, legendary, weapon, and, divine, attribute, that, was, made, from, an, adamantine, or, an, indestructible, substance, which, could, therefore, pierce, and, penetrate, any, obstacle, or, obfuscation, it, is, the, weapon, of, choice, of, indra, the, king, of, the, devas, as, a, secondary, meaning, vajra, symbolizes, the, ultimate, nature, of, things, which, is, described, in, the, tantras, as, translucent, pure, and, radiant, but, also, indestructible, and, indivisible, it, is, also, symbolic, of, the, power, of, tantric, methods, to, achieve, its, goals, a, vajra, is, also, a, scepter, like, ritual, object, standard, tibetan, dorje, which, has, a, sphere, and, sometimes, a, gankyil, at, its, centre, and, a, variable, number, of, spokes, 3, 5, or, 9, at, each, end, depending, on, the, sadhana, enfolding, either, end, of, the, rod, the, vajra, is, often, traditionally, employed, in, tantric, rituals, in, combination, with, the, bell, or, ghanta, symbolically, the, vajra, may, represent, method, as, well, as, great, bliss, and, the, bell, stands, for, wisdom, specifically, the, wisdom, realizing, emptiness, the, union, of, the, two, sets, of, spokes, at, the, center, of, the, wheel, is, said, to, symbolize, the, unity, of, wisdom, praj, a, and, compassion, karuna, as, well, as, the, sexual, union, of, male, and, female, deities, representations, of, the, deity, such, as, statues, murti, paintings, thangka, or, mandala, are, often, employed, as, an, aid, to, visualization, in, deity, yoga, the, use, of, visual, aids, particularly, microcosmic, macrocosmic, diagrams, known, as, mandalas, is, another, unique, feature, of, buddhist, tantra, mandalas, are, symbolic, depictions, of, the, sacred, space, of, the, awakened, buddhas, and, bodhisattvas, as, well, as, of, the, inner, workings, of, the, human, person, the, macrocosmic, symbolism, of, the, mandala, then, also, represents, the, forces, of, the, human, body, the, explanatory, tantra, of, the, guhyasamaja, tantra, the, vajramala, states, the, body, becomes, a, palace, the, hallowed, basis, of, all, the, buddhas, mandalas, are, also, sacred, enclosures, sacred, architecture, that, house, and, contain, the, uncontainable, essence, of, a, central, deity, or, yidam, and, their, retinue, in, the, book, the, world, of, tibetan, buddhism, the, dalai, lama, describes, mandalas, thus, this, is, the, celestial, mansion, the, pure, residence, of, the, deity, the, five, tathagatas, or, five, buddhas, along, with, the, figure, of, the, adi, buddha, are, central, to, many, vajrayana, mandalas, as, they, represent, the, five, wisdoms, which, are, the, five, primary, aspects, of, primordial, wisdom, or, buddha, nature, all, ritual, in, vajrayana, practice, can, be, seen, as, aiding, in, this, process, of, visualization, and, identification, the, practitioner, can, use, various, hand, implements, such, as, a, vajra, bell, hand, drum, damaru, or, a, ritual, dagger, phurba, but, also, ritual, hand, gestures, mudras, can, be, made, special, chanting, techniques, can, be, used, and, in, elaborate, offering, rituals, or, initiations, many, more, ritual, implements, and, tools, are, used, each, with, an, elaborate, symbolic, meaning, to, create, a, special, environment, for, practice, vajrayana, has, thus, become, a, major, inspiration, in, traditional, tibetan, art, there, is, an, extended, body, of, texts, associated, with, buddhist, tantra, including, the, tantras, themselves, tantric, commentaries, and, shastras, sadhanas, liturgical, texts, ritual, manuals, chinese, pinyin, y, gu, r, maji, giki, dharanis, poems, or, songs, dohas, termas, and, so, on, according, to, harunaga, isaacson, though, we, do, not, know, precisely, at, present, just, how, many, indian, tantric, buddhist, texts, survive, today, in, the, language, in, which, they, were, written, their, number, is, certainly, over, one, thousand, five, hundred, i, suspect, indeed, over, two, thousand, a, large, part, of, this, body, of, texts, has, also, been, translated, into, tibetan, and, a, smaller, part, into, chinese, aside, from, these, there, are, perhaps, another, two, thousand, or, more, works, that, are, known, today, only, from, such, translations, we, can, be, certain, as, well, that, many, others, are, lost, to, us, forever, in, whatever, form, of, the, texts, that, survive, a, very, small, proportion, has, been, published, an, almost, insignificant, percentage, has, been, edited, or, translated, reliably, vajray, na, texts, exhibit, a, wide, range, of, literary, characteristics, usually, a, mix, of, verse, and, prose, almost, always, in, a, sanskrit, that, transgresses, frequently, against, classical, norms, of, grammar, and, usage, although, also, occasionally, in, various, middle, indic, dialects, or, elegant, classical, sanskrit, in, chinese, mantrayana, zhenyan, and, japanese, shingon, the, most, influential, esoteric, texts, are, the, mahavairocana, tantra, and, the, vajra, ekhara, s, tra, in, tibetan, buddhism, a, large, number, of, tantric, works, are, widely, studied, and, different, schools, focus, on, the, study, and, practice, of, different, cycles, of, texts, according, to, geoffrey, samuel, the, sakyapa, specialize, in, the, hevajra, tantra, the, nyingmapa, specialize, in, the, various, so, called, old, tantras, and, terma, cycles, and, the, most, important, kagyudpa, and, gelugpa, tantras, are, guhyasam, ja, cakrasa, vara, and, k, lacakra, the, dunhuang, manuscripts, also, contain, tibetan, tantric, manuscripts, dalton, and, schaik, 2007, revised, provide, an, excellent, online, catalogue, listing, 350, tibetan, tantric, manuscripts, from, dunhuang, in, the, stein, collection, of, the, british, library, which, is, currently, fully, accessible, online, in, discrete, digitized, manuscripts, with, the, wylie, transcription, of, the, manuscripts, they, are, to, be, made, discoverable, online, in, the, future, these, 350, texts, are, just, a, small, portion, of, the, vast, cache, of, the, dunhuang, manuscripts, although, there, is, historical, evidence, for, vajray, na, buddhism, in, southeast, asia, and, elsewhere, see, history, of, vajray, na, above, today, the, vajray, na, exists, primarily, in, the, form, of, the, two, major, traditions, of, indo, tibetan, buddhism, in, tibet, and, other, parts, of, the, prc, bhutan, india, and, also, internationally, and, japanese, esoteric, buddhism, mostly, in, japan, which, is, found, in, the, shingon, literally, true, speech, i, e, mantra, and, tendai, schools, other, traditions, like, contemporary, chinese, buddhism, japanese, zen, korean, buddhism, and, vietnamese, buddhism, also, make, use, of, esoteric, chinese, mijiao, japanese, mikkyo, or, mantrayana, methods, to, a, lesser, extent, in, many, asian, mahayana, buddhist, traditions, esoteric, methods, are, used, as, a, complement, not, as, the, central, practice, this, mainly, involves, the, recitation, of, mantras, like, the, ten, small, mantras, and, various, popular, dharanis, however, certain, revival, movements, have, attempted, to, establish, new, esoteric, schools, in, mainland, east, asia, such, as, mantra, school, bright, lineage, in, china, and, the, south, korean, jingak, order, there, was, strong, connection, between, the, palas, in, bengal, srivijaya, in, nusantara, and, the, kingdoms, in, east, asia, through, the, sea, route, medieval, monks, were, a, prime, factor, in, the, spread, of, esoteric, buddhism, the, distinction, between, mantrayana, traditions, is, not, always, rigid, for, example, the, tantra, sections, of, the, tibetan, buddhist, canon, of, texts, sometimes, include, material, not, usually, thought, of, as, tantric, outside, the, tibetan, buddhist, tradition, such, as, the, widely, recited, heart, sutra, and, even, versions, of, some, material, found, in, the, pali, canon, esoteric, and, tantric, teachings, followed, the, same, route, into, northern, china, as, buddhism, itself, arriving, via, the, silk, road, and, southeast, asian, maritime, trade, routes, sometime, during, the, first, half, of, the, 7th, century, during, the, tang, dynasty, and, received, sanction, from, the, emperors, of, the, tang, dynasty, during, this, time, three, great, masters, came, from, india, to, china, ubhakarasi, ha, vajrabodhi, and, amoghavajra, who, translated, key, texts, and, founded, the, zhenyan, true, word, mantra, tradition, zhenyan, was, also, brought, to, japan, as, shingon, during, this, period, this, tradition, focused, on, tantras, like, the, mahavairocana, tantra, and, unlike, tibetan, buddhism, it, does, not, employ, the, antinomian, and, radical, tantrism, of, the, anuttarayoga, tantras, the, prestige, of, this, tradition, eventually, influenced, other, schools, of, chinese, buddhism, such, as, chan, and, tiantai, to, adopt, various, esoteric, practices, over, time, leading, to, a, merging, of, teachings, between, the, various, schools, during, the, yuan, dynasty, the, mongol, emperors, made, tibetan, buddhism, the, official, religion, of, china, and, tibetan, lamas, were, given, patronage, at, the, court, imperial, support, of, tibetan, vajrayana, continued, into, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, today, esoteric, traditions, are, deeply, embedded, in, mainstream, chinese, buddhism, and, expressed, through, various, rituals, which, make, use, of, tantric, mantra, and, dh, ra, and, the, veneration, of, certain, tantric, deities, like, cundi, and, acala, one, example, of, esoteric, teachings, still, practiced, in, many, chinese, buddhist, monasteries, is, the, ra, gama, s, tra, and, the, dh, ra, revealed, within, it, the, ra, gama, mantra, which, are, especially, influential, in, the, chinese, chan, tradition, a, recent, development, is, known, as, the, tantric, revival, movement, mijiao, fuxing, yundong, which, involved, the, revival, of, chinese, esoteric, schools, by, chinese, students, of, japanese, shingon, some, important, figures, of, this, revival, include, wang, hongyuan, 1876, 1937, and, guru, wuguang, 1918, 2000, both, trained, in, shingon, and, went, on, to, spread, shingon, teachings, in, the, chinese, speaking, world, these, revivalist, lineages, exist, in, hong, kong, taiwan, and, malaysia, though, they, draw, mainly, from, shingon, teachings, they, have, also, adopted, some, tibetan, buddhist, elements, another, form, of, esoteric, buddhism, in, china, is, the, related, but, unique, tradition, of, azhaliism, which, is, practiced, among, the, bai, people, of, china, and, venerates, mahakala, as, a, major, deity, the, shingon, school, is, found, in, japan, and, includes, practices, known, in, japan, as, mikky, esoteric, or, mystery, teaching, which, are, similar, in, concept, to, those, in, vajrayana, buddhism, the, lineage, for, shingon, buddhism, differs, from, that, of, tibetan, vajrayana, having, emerged, from, india, during, the, 9th, 11th, centuries, in, the, pala, dynasty, and, central, asia, via, china, and, is, based, on, earlier, versions, of, the, indian, texts, than, the, tibetan, lineage, shingon, shares, material, with, tibetan, buddhism, such, as, the, esoteric, sutras, called, tantras, in, tibetan, buddhism, and, mandalas, but, the, actual, practices, are, not, related, the, primary, texts, of, shingon, buddhism, are, the, mahavairocana, sutra, and, vajrasekhara, sutra, the, founder, of, shingon, buddhism, was, kukai, a, japanese, monk, who, studied, in, china, in, the, 9th, century, during, the, tang, dynasty, and, brought, back, vajrayana, scriptures, techniques, and, mandalas, then, popular, in, china, the, school, was, merged, into, other, schools, in, china, towards, the, end, of, the, tang, dynasty, but, was, sectarian, in, japan, shingon, is, one, of, the, few, remaining, branches, of, buddhism, in, the, world, that, continues, to, use, the, siddham, script, of, the, sanskrit, language, although, the, tendai, school, in, china, and, japan, does, employ, some, esoteric, practices, these, rituals, came, to, be, considered, of, equal, importance, with, the, exoteric, teachings, of, the, lotus, sutra, by, chanting, mantras, maintaining, mudras, or, practicing, certain, forms, of, meditation, tendai, maintains, that, one, is, able, to, understand, sense, experiences, as, taught, by, the, buddha, have, faith, that, one, is, innately, an, enlightened, being, and, that, one, can, attain, enlightenment, within, the, current, lifetime, esoteric, buddhist, practices, known, as, milgyo, and, texts, arrived, in, korea, during, the, initial, introduction, of, buddhism, to, the, region, in, 372, ce, esoteric, buddhism, was,

serious, vajrayana, academic, study, in, the, western, world, is, in, early, stages, due, to, the, following, obstacles, buddhist, tantric, practice, is, categorized, as, secret, practice, this, is, to, avoid, misinformed, people, from, harmfully, misusing, the, practices, a, method, to, keep, this, secrecy, is, that, tantric, initiation, is, required, from, a, master, before, any, instructions, can, be, received, about, the, actual, practice, during, the, initiation, procedure, in, the, highest, class, of, tantra, such, as, the, kalachakra, students, must, take, the, tantric, vows, which, commit, them, to, such, secrecy, explaining, general, tantra, theory, in, a, scholarly, manner, not, sufficient, for, practice, is, likewise, not, a, root, downfall, nevertheless, it, weakens, the, effectiveness, of, our, tantric, practice, the, terminology, associated, with, vajrayana, buddhism, can, be, confusing, most, of, the, terms, originated, in, the, sanskrit, language, of, tantric, indian, buddhism, and, may, have, passed, through, other, cultures, notably, those, of, japan, and, tibet, before, translation, for, the, modern, reader, further, complications, arise, as, seemingly, equivalent, terms, can, have, subtle, variations, in, use, and, meaning, according, to, context, the, time, and, place, of, use, a, third, problem, is, that, the, vajrayana, texts, employ, the, tantric, tradition, of, twilight, language, a, means, of, instruction, that, is, deliberately, coded, these, obscure, teaching, methods, relying, on, symbolism, as, well, as, synonym, metaphor, and, word, association, add, to, the, difficulties, faced, by, those, attempting, to, understand, vajrayana, buddhism, in, the, vajrayana, tradition, now, preserved, mainly, in, tibetan, lineages, it, has, long, been, recognized, that, certain, important, teachings, are, expressed, in, a, form, of, secret, symbolic, language, known, as, sa, dhy, bh, twilight, language, mudr, s, and, mantras, ma, alas, and, cakras, those, mysterious, devices, and, diagrams, that, were, so, much, in, vogue, in, the, pseudo, buddhist, hippie, culture, of, the, 1960s, were, all, examples, of, twilight, language, the, term, tantric, buddhism, was, not, one, originally, used, by, those, who, practiced, it, as, scholar, isabelle, onians, explains, tantric, buddhism, is, not, the, transcription, of, a, native, term, but, a, rather, modern, coinage, if, not, totally, occidental, for, the, equivalent, sanskrit, t, ntrika, is, found, but, not, in, buddhist, texts, t, ntrika, is, a, term, denoting, someone, who, follows, the, teachings, of, scriptures, known, as, tantras, but, only, in, saivism, not, buddhism, tantric, buddhism, is, a, name, for, a, phenomenon, which, calls, itself, in, sanskrit, mantranaya, vajray, na, mantray, na, or, mantramah, y, na, and, apparently, never, tantray, na, its, practitioners, are, known, as, mantrins, yogis, or, s, dhakas, thus, our, use, of, the, anglicised, adjective, tantric, for, the, buddhist, religion, taught, in, tantras, is, not, native, to, the, tradition, but, is, a, borrowed, term, which, serves, its, purpose
