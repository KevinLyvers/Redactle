of, the, messiah, and, of, the, eschaton, in, various, faiths, that, revere, the, hebrew, bible, references, to, elijah, appear, in, sirach, the, new, testament, the, mishnah, and, talmud, the, quran, the, book, of, mormon, and, bah, writings, scholars, generally, agree, that, a, historical, figure, named, elijah, existed, in, ancient, israel, yet, some, argue, that, the, biblical, portrayal, of, him, reflects, legendary, and, theological, embellishment, rather, than, purely, historical, documentation, in, judaism, elijah, s, name, is, invoked, at, the, weekly, havdalah, rite, that, marks, the, end, of, shabbat, and, elijah, is, invoked, in, other, jewish, customs, among, them, the, passover, seder, and, the, brit, milah, ritual, circumcision, he, appears, in, numerous, stories, and, references, in, the, haggadah, and, rabbinic, literature, including, the, babylonian, talmud, according, to, some, jewish, interpretations, elijah, will, return, during, the, end, of, times, the, christian, new, testament, notes, that, some, people, thought, that, jesus, was, in, some, sense, elijah, but, it, also, makes, clear, that, john, the, baptist, is, the, elijah, who, was, promised, to, come, in, malachi, 3, 1, 4, 5, according, to, accounts, in, all, three, of, the, synoptic, gospels, elijah, appeared, with, moses, during, the, transfiguration, of, jesus, elijah, in, islam, appears, in, the, quran, as, a, prophet, and, messenger, of, god, where, his, biblical, narrative, of, preaching, against, the, worshipers, of, baal, is, recounted, in, a, concise, form, due, to, his, importance, to, muslims, catholics, and, orthodox, christians, elijah, has, been, venerated, as, the, patron, saint, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, since, 1752, according, to, the, bible, by, the, 9th, century, bc, the, kingdom, of, israel, once, united, under, solomon, had, been, divided, into, the, northern, kingdom, of, israel, and, the, southern, kingdom, of, judah, which, retained, the, historical, capital, of, jerusalem, along, with, its, temple, omri, king, of, israel, continued, policies, dating, from, the, reign, of, jeroboam, contrary, to, religious, law, that, were, intended, to, reorient, religious, focus, away, from, jerusalem, encouraging, the, building, of, local, temple, altars, for, sacrifices, appointing, priests, from, outside, the, family, of, the, levites, and, allowing, or, encouraging, temples, dedicated, to, baal, an, important, deity, in, ancient, canaanite, religion, omri, achieved, domestic, security, with, a, marriage, alliance, between, his, son, ahab, and, princess, jezebel, a, worshipper, of, baal, and, the, daughter, of, the, king, of, sidon, in, phoenicia, these, solutions, brought, security, and, economic, prosperity, to, israel, for, a, time, but, did, not, bring, peace, with, the, israelite, prophets, who, advocated, a, strict, deuteronomic, interpretation, of, the, religious, law, under, ahab, s, kingship, tensions, exacerbated, ahab, built, a, temple, for, baal, and, his, wife, jezebel, brought, a, large, entourage, of, priests, and, prophets, of, baal, and, asherah, into, the, country, in, this, context, elijah, is, introduced, in, 1, kings, 17, 1, as, elijah, the, tishbite, he, warns, ahab, that, there, will, be, years, of, catastrophic, drought, so, severe, that, not, even, dew, will, form, because, ahab, and, his, queen, stand, at, the, end, of, a, line, of, kings, of, israel, who, are, said, to, have, done, evil, in, the, sight, of, the, lord, no, background, for, the, person, of, elijah, is, given, except, for, his, brief, characterization, as, a, tishbite, his, name, in, hebrew, means, my, god, is, jah, and, may, be, a, title, applied, to, him, because, of, his, challenge, to, worship, of, baal, as, told, in, the, hebrew, bible, elijah, s, challenge, is, bold, and, direct, baal, was, the, canaanite, god, responsible, for, rain, thunder, lightning, and, dew, elijah, thus, when, he, initially, announces, the, drought, not, only, challenges, baal, on, behalf, of, god, himself, but, he, also, challenges, jezebel, her, priests, ahab, and, the, people, of, israel, after, elijah, s, confrontation, with, ahab, god, tells, him, to, flee, out, of, israel, to, a, hiding, place, by, the, brook, chorath, east, of, the, jordan, where, he, will, be, fed, by, ravens, when, the, brook, dries, up, god, sends, him, to, a, widow, living, in, the, town, of, zarephath, in, phoenicia, when, elijah, finds, her, he, asks, her, for, some, water, and, a, piece, of, bread, but, she, says, that, she, does, not, have, sufficient, food, to, keep, her, and, her, own, son, alive, elijah, tells, her, that, god, will, not, allow, her, supply, of, flour, or, oil, to, run, out, saying, do, not, be, afraid, for, thus, says, the, lord, the, god, of, israel, the, jar, of, flour, will, not, be, used, up, and, the, jug, of, oil, will, not, run, dry, until, the, day, the, lord, sends, rain, on, the, land, she, feeds, him, the, last, of, their, food, and, elijah, s, promise, miraculously, comes, true, some, time, later, the, widow, s, son, dies, and, the, widow, cries, you, have, come, to, me, to, bring, my, sin, to, remembrance, and, to, cause, the, death, of, my, son, elijah, prays, that, god, might, restore, her, son, so, that, the, trustworthiness, of, god, s, word, might, be, demonstrated, and, listened, to, the, voice, of, elijah, the, life, of, the, child, came, into, him, again, and, he, revived, this, is, the, first, instance, of, raising, the, dead, recorded, in, scripture, the, widow, cried, the, word, of, the, lord, in, your, mouth, is, truth, after, more, than, three, years, of, drought, and, famine, god, tells, elijah, to, return, to, ahab, and, announce, the, end, of, the, drought, while, on, his, way, elijah, meets, obadiah, the, head, of, ahab, s, household, who, had, hidden, a, hundred, jewish, prophets, from, jezebel, s, violent, purge, obadiah, fears, that, when, he, reports, to, ahab, about, elijah, s, whereabouts, elijah, would, disappear, provoking, ahab, to, execute, him, elijah, reassures, obadiah, and, sends, him, to, ahab, when, ahab, confronts, elijah, he, denounces, him, as, being, the, troubler, of, israel, but, elijah, retorts, that, ahab, himself, is, the, one, who, troubled, israel, by, allowing, the, worship, of, false, gods, shedim, at, elijah, s, instruction, ahab, summons, the, people, of, israel, 450, prophets, of, baal, and, 400, prophets, of, asherah, to, mount, carmel, elijah, then, berates, the, people, for, their, acquiescence, in, baal, worship, how, long, will, you, go, limping, with, two, different, opinions, if, the, l, ord, is, god, follow, him, but, if, baal, then, follow, him, elijah, proposes, a, direct, test, of, the, powers, of, baal, and, yahweh, both, asherah, and, her, prophets, disappear, from, the, story, entirely, he, and, baal, s, prophets, will, each, take, one, of, two, bulls, prepare, it, for, sacrifice, and, lay, it, on, wood, but, put, no, fire, to, it, the, prophets, of, baal, choose, and, prepare, a, bull, accordingly, elijah, then, invites, them, to, pray, for, fire, to, light, the, sacrifice, they, pray, from, morning, to, noon, without, success, elijah, ridicules, their, efforts, at, noon, elijah, mocked, them, saying, cry, aloud, surely, he, is, a, god, either, he, is, meditating, or, he, has, wandered, away, or, he, is, on, a, journey, or, perhaps, he, is, asleep, and, must, be, awakened, they, respond, by, shouting, louder, and, slashing, themselves, with, swords, and, spears, they, continue, praying, until, evening, without, success, elijah, then, repairs, yahweh, s, altar, with, twelve, stones, representing, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, elijah, digs, a, trench, around, it, and, prepares, the, other, bull, for, sacrifice, as, before, he, then, orders, that, the, sacrifice, and, altar, be, drenched, with, water, from, four, large, jars, poured, three, times, filling, also, the, trench, he, asks, yahweh, to, accept, the, sacrifice, fire, falls, from, the, sky, consuming, the, sacrifice, the, stones, of, the, altar, itself, the, earth, and, the, water, in, the, trench, as, well, when, the, people, see, this, they, declare, the, l, ord, he, is, god, the, l, ord, he, is, god, elijah, then, orders, them, to, seize, the, prophets, of, baal, which, they, do, and, elijah, brings, them, down, to, the, river, kishon, and, slays, them, at, which, the, rains, begin, signaling, the, end, of, the, famine, jezebel, enraged, that, elijah, has, killed, the, prophets, of, baal, threatens, to, kill, him, elijah, flees, to, beersheba, in, judah, continues, alone, into, the, wilderness, and, finally, sits, down, under, a, shrub, praying, for, death, and, eventually, falling, asleep, at, length, an, angel, of, the, lord, rouses, him, gently, telling, him, to, wake, up, and, eat, when, he, awakens, he, finds, bread, and, a, jar, of, water, eats, drinks, and, goes, back, to, sleep, the, angel, then, comes, to, him, a, second, time, telling, him, to, eat, and, drink, afresh, because, he, has, a, long, journey, ahead, of, him, elijah, travels, for, forty, days, and, forty, nights, to, mount, horeb, where, moses, had, received, the, ten, commandments, elijah, is, the, only, person, described, in, the, bible, as, returning, to, horeb, after, moses, and, his, generation, had, left, horeb, several, centuries, before, he, seeks, shelter, in, a, cave, elijah, is, told, to, go, out, and, stand, on, the, mountain, in, the, presence, of, the, l, ord, for, the, l, ord, is, about, to, pass, by, there, comes, a, mighty, wind, then, an, earthquake, and, then, fire, but, yahweh, is, not, in, any, of, these, choosing, to, come, instead, as, a, still, small, voice, which, bids, elijah, go, forth, again, this, time, to, damascus, to, anoint, hazael, as, king, of, aram, jehu, as, king, of, israel, and, elisha, as, the, old, prophet, s, successor, elijah, encounters, ahab, again, in, 1, kings, 21, after, ahab, has, acquired, possession, of, a, vineyard, by, murder, ahab, desires, to, have, the, vineyard, of, naboth, of, jezreel, he, offers, a, better, vineyard, or, a, fair, price, for, the, land, but, naboth, tells, ahab, that, god, has, told, him, not, to, part, with, the, land, ahab, accepts, this, answer, with, sullen, bad, grace, jezebel, however, plots, a, method, for, acquiring, the, land, she, sends, letters, in, ahab, s, name, to, the, elders, and, nobles, who, live, near, naboth, they, are, to, arrange, a, feast, and, invite, naboth, at, the, feast, false, charges, of, cursing, god, and, ahab, are, to, be, made, against, him, the, plot, is, carried, out, and, naboth, is, stoned, to, death, when, word, comes, that, naboth, is, dead, jezebel, tells, ahab, to, take, possession, of, the, vineyard, god, again, speaks, to, elijah, and, sends, him, to, confront, ahab, with, a, question, and, a, prophecy, have, you, killed, and, also, taken, possession, and, in, the, place, where, dogs, licked, up, the, blood, of, naboth, dogs, will, also, lick, up, your, blood, ahab, begins, the, confrontation, by, calling, elijah, his, enemy, elijah, responds, by, throwing, the, charge, back, at, him, telling, him, that, he, has, made, himself, the, enemy, of, god, by, his, own, actions, elijah, tells, ahab, that, his, entire, kingdom, will, reject, his, authority, that, jezebel, will, be, eaten, by, dogs, within, jezreel, and, that, his, family, will, be, consumed, by, dogs, as, well, if, they, die, in, a, city, or, by, birds, if, they, die, in, the, country, when, ahab, hears, this, he, repents, so, sincerely, that, god, stays, his, hand, in, punishing, ahab, choosing, instead, to, vent, his, wrath, upon, jezebel, and, her, son, by, ahab, ahaziah, elijah, s, story, continues, now, from, ahab, to, an, encounter, with, ahaziah, 2, kings, 1, the, scene, opens, with, ahaziah, seriously, injured, in, a, fall, he, sends, to, the, priests, of, baalzebub, in, ekron, outside, the, kingdom, of, israel, to, know, if, he, will, recover, elijah, intercepts, his, messengers, and, sends, them, back, to, ahaziah, with, a, message, is, it, because, there, is, no, god, in, israel, that, you, are, sending, to, inquire, of, baal, zebub, the, god, of, ekron, ahaziah, asks, the, messengers, to, describe, the, person, who, gave, them, this, message, they, tell, him, he, was, a, hairy, man, with, a, leather, belt, around, his, waist, and, he, instantly, recognizes, the, description, as, elijah, the, tishbite, ahaziah, sends, out, three, groups, of, soldiers, to, arrest, elijah, the, first, two, are, destroyed, by, fire, which, elijah, calls, down, from, heaven, the, leader, of, the, third, group, asks, for, mercy, for, himself, and, his, men, elijah, agrees, to, accompany, this, third, group, to, ahaziah, where, he, gives, his, prophecy, in, person, ahaziah, dies, without, recovering, from, his, injuries, in, accordance, with, elijah, s, word, according, to, 2, kings, 2, 3, 9, elisha, eliseus, and, the, sons, of, the, prophets, knew, beforehand, that, elijah, would, one, day, be, assumed, into, heaven, elisha, asked, elijah, to, let, a, double, portion, of, elijah, s, spirit, be, upon, him, elijah, agreed, with, the, condition, that, elisha, would, see, him, be, taken, elijah, in, company, with, elisha, approaches, the, jordan, he, rolls, up, his, mantle, and, strikes, the, water, the, water, immediately, divides, and, elijah, and, elisha, cross, on, dry, land, suddenly, a, chariot, of, fire, and, horses, of, fire, appear, and, elijah, is, lifted, up, in, a, whirlwind, as, elijah, is, lifted, up, his, mantle, falls, to, the, ground, and, elisha, picks, it, up, elijah, is, mentioned, once, more, in, 2, chronicles, 21, 12, which, will, be, his, final, mention, in, the, hebrew, bible, a, letter, is, sent, under, the, prophet, s, name, to, jehoram, of, judah, it, tells, him, that, he, has, led, the, people, of, judah, astray, in, the, same, way, that, israel, was, led, astray, the, prophet, ends, the, letter, with, a, prediction, of, a, painful, death, this, letter, is, a, puzzle, to, readers, for, several, reasons, first, it, concerns, a, king, of, the, southern, kingdom, while, elijah, concerned, himself, with, the, kingdom, of, israel, second, the, message, begins, with, thus, says, yhvh, god, of, your, father, david, rather, than, the, more, usual, in, the, name, of, yhvh, the, god, of, israel, also, this, letter, seems, to, come, after, elijah, s, ascension, into, the, whirlwind, michael, wilcock, formerly, of, trinity, college, bristol, suggests, a, number, of, possible, reasons, for, this, letter, among, them, that, it, may, be, an, example, of, a, better, known, prophet, s, name, being, substituted, for, that, of, a, lesser, known, prophet, john, van, seters, however, rejects, the, letter, as, having, any, connection, with, the, elijah, tradition, however, wilcock, argues, that, elijah, s, letter, does, address, a, very, northern, situation, in, the, southern, kingdom, and, thus, is, authentic, while, the, final, mention, of, elijah, in, the, hebrew, bible, is, in, the, book, of, chronicles, the, christian, bible, s, reordering, places, the, book, of, malachi, which, prophesies, a, messiah, as, the, final, book, of, the, old, testament, before, the, new, testament, gospels, thus, elijah, s, final, old, testament, appearance, is, in, the, book, of, malachi, where, it, is, written, behold, i, will, send, you, elijah, the, prophet, before, the, great, and, awesome, day, of, the, lord, comes, and, he, will, turn, the, hearts, of, fathers, to, their, children, and, the, hearts, of, children, to, their, fathers, lest, i, come, and, strike, the, land, with, a, decree, of, utter, destruction, scholars, generally, agree, that, a, prophet, named, elijah, existed, in, the, kingdom, of, israel, during, the, reigns, of, kings, ahab, and, ahaziah, that, he, was, a, religious, figure, of, great, personal, dynamism, and, conservative, zeal, and, the, leader, of, resistance, to, the, rise, of, baal, worship, in, israel, in, the, ninth, century, bc, in, the, opinion, of, some, scholars, however, the, biblical, presentation, of, the, prophet, cannot, be, taken, as, historical, documentation, of, his, activity, the, biblical, texts, present, his, career, through, the, eyes, of, popular, legend, and, subsequent, theological, reflection, which, consider, him, a, personality, of, heroic, proportions, in, this, process, his, actions, and, relations, to, the, people, and, the, king, became, stereotyped, and, the, presentation, of, his, behavior, paradigmatic, jewish, legends, about, elijah, abound, in, the, aggadah, which, is, found, throughout, various, collections, of, rabbinic, literature, including, the, babylonian, talmud, this, varied, literature, does, not, merely, discuss, his, life, but, has, created, a, new, history, of, him, which, beginning, with, his, death, or, translation, ends, only, with, the, close, of, the, history, of, the, human, race, the, volume, of, references, to, elijah, in, jewish, tradition, stands, in, marked, contrast, to, that, in, the, canon, as, in, the, case, of, most, figures, of, jewish, legend, so, in, the, case, of, elijah, the, biblical, account, became, the, basis, of, later, legend, elijah, the, precursor, of, the, messiah, elijah, zealous, in, the, cause, of, god, elijah, the, helper, in, distress, these, are, the, three, leading, notes, struck, by, the, aggadah, endeavoring, to, complete, the, biblical, picture, with, the, elijah, legends, his, career, is, extensive, colorful, and, varied, he, has, appeared, the, world, over, in, the, guise, of, a, beggar, and, scholar, from, the, time, of, malachi, who, says, of, elijah, that, god, will, send, him, before, the, great, and, dreadful, day, down, to, the, later, stories, of, the, chasidic, rabbis, reverence, and, love, expectation, and, hope, were, always, connected, in, the, jewish, consciousness, with, elijah, three, different, theories, regarding, elijah, s, origin, are, presented, in, the, aggadah, literature, 1, he, belonged, to, the, tribe, of, gad, 2, he, was, a, benjamite, from, jerusalem, identical, with, the, elijah, mentioned, in, 1, chronicles, 8, 27, and, 3, he, was, a, priest, many, christian, church, fathers, also, have, stated, that, elijah, was, a, priest, some, rabbis, have, speculated, that, he, should, be, identified, with, phinehas, according, to, later, kabbalistic, literature, elijah, was, really, an, angel, in, human, form, so, that, he, had, neither, parents, nor, offspring, the, midrash, rabbah, exodus, 4, 2, states, elijah, should, have, revived, his, parents, as, he, had, revived, the, son, of, the, zarephathite, indicating, he, surely, had, parents, the, talmud, states, said, he, to, him, elijah, art, thou, not, a, priest, why, then, dost, thou, stand, in, a, cemetery, a, midrash, tells, that, they, even, abolished, the, sign, of, the, covenant, and, the, prophet, had, to, appear, as, israel, s, accuser, before, god, in, the, same, cave, where, god, once, appeared, to, moses, and, revealed, himself, as, gracious, and, merciful, elijah, was, summoned, to, appear, before, god, by, this, summons, he, perceived, that, he, should, have, appealed, to, god, s, mercy, instead, of, becoming, israel, s, accuser, the, prophet, however, remained, relentless, in, his, zeal, and, severity, so, that, god, commanded, him, to, appoint, his, successor, the, vision, in, which, god, revealed, himself, to, elijah, gave, him, at, the, same, time, a, picture, of, the, destinies, of, man, who, has, to, pass, through, four, worlds, this, world, was, shown, to, the, prophet, by, god, through, symbolism, in, the, form, of, the, wind, since, the, world, disappears, as, the, wind, storm, is, the, day, of, death, before, which, man, trembles, fire, is, the, judgment, in, gehenna, and, the, stillness, is, the, last, day, three, years, after, this, vision, elijah, was, translated, concerning, the, place, to, which, elijah, was, transferred, opinions, differ, among, jews, and, christians, but, the, old, view, was, that, elijah, was, received, among, the, heavenly, inhabitants, where, he, records, the, deeds, of, men, but, as, early, as, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, century, when, the, notion, of, translation, to, heaven, underwent, divergent, possible, interpretations, by, christian, theologians, the, assertion, was, made, that, elijah, never, entered, into, heaven, proper, in, later, literature, paradise, is, generally, designated, as, the, abode, of, elijah, but, since, the, location, of, paradise, is, itself, uncertain, the, last, two, statements, may, be, identical, at, the, appointed, time, it, is, written, you, are, destined, to, calm, the, wrath, of, god, before, it, breaks, out, in, fury, to, turn, the, hearts, of, parents, to, their, children, and, to, restore, the, tribes, of, jacob, elijah, s, glory, is, honoured, in, the, book, of, sirach, ecclesiasticus, his, designated, tasks, are, altered, to, at, jewish, circumcision, ceremonies, a, chair, is, set, aside, for, the, use, of, the, prophet, elijah, elijah, is, said, to, be, a, witness, at, all, circumcisions, when, the, sign, of, the, covenant, is, placed, upon, the, body, of, the, child, this, custom, stems, from, the, incident, at, mount, horeb, elijah, had, arrived, at, mount, horeb, after, the, demonstration, of, god, s, presence, and, power, on, mount, carmel, god, asks, elijah, to, explain, his, arrival, and, elijah, replies, i, have, been, very, jealous, for, the, lord, the, god, of, hosts, for, the, people, of, israel, have, forsaken, thy, covenant, thrown, down, thy, altars, and, slain, thy, prophets, with, the, sword, and, i, even, i, only, am, left, and, they, seek, my, life, to, take, it, away, according, to, rabbinic, tradition, elijah, s, words, were, patently, untrue, and, since, elijah, accused, israel, of, failing, to, uphold, the, covenant, god, would, require, elijah, to, be, present, at, every, covenant, of, circumcision, in, the, talmudic, literature, elijah, would, visit, rabbis, to, help, solve, particularly, difficult, legal, problems, malachi, had, cited, elijah, as, the, harbinger, of, the, eschaton, thus, when, confronted, with, reconciling, impossibly, conflicting, laws, or, rituals, the, rabbis, would, set, aside, any, decision, until, elijah, comes, one, such, decision, was, whether, the, passover, seder, required, four, or, five, cups, of, wine, each, serving, of, wine, corresponds, to, one, of, the, four, expressions, of, redemption, in, the, book, of, exodus, i, am, the, lord, and, i, will, bring, you, out, from, under, the, burdens, of, the, egyptians, and, i, will, deliver, you, from, their,

that, i, am, the, lord, your, god, who, has, brought, you, out, from, under, the, burdens, of, the, egyptians, the, next, verse, and, i, will, bring, you, into, the, land, which, i, swore, to, give, to, abraham, to, isaac, and, to, jacob, i, will, give, it, to, you, for, a, possession, i, am, the, lord, was, not, fulfilled, until, the, generation, following, the, passover, story, and, the, rabbis, could, not, decide, whether, this, verse, counted, as, part, of, the, passover, celebration, thus, deserving, of, another, serving, of, wine, thus, a, cup, was, left, for, the, arrival, of, elijah, in, practice, the, fifth, cup, has, come, to, be, seen, as, a, celebration, of, future, redemption, today, a, place, is, reserved, at, the, seder, table, and, a, cup, of, wine, is, placed, there, for, elijah, during, the, seder, the, door, of, the, house, is, opened, and, elijah, is, invited, in, traditionally, the, cup, is, viewed, as, elijah, s, and, is, used, for, no, other, purpose, havdalah, is, the, ceremony, that, concludes, the, sabbath, day, saturday, evening, in, jewish, tradition, as, part, of, the, concluding, hymn, an, appeal, is, made, to, god, that, elijah, will, come, during, the, following, week, elijah, the, prophet, elijah, the, tishbite, elijah, from, gilead, let, him, come, quickly, in, our, day, with, the, messiah, the, son, of, david, the, volume, of, references, to, elijah, in, folklore, stands, in, marked, contrast, to, that, in, the, canon, elijah, s, miraculous, transferral, to, heaven, led, to, speculation, as, to, his, true, identity, louis, ginzberg, equates, him, with, phinehas, the, grandson, of, aaron, because, of, phinehas, zealousness, for, god, he, and, his, descendants, were, promised, a, covenant, of, lasting, priesthood, therefore, elijah, is, a, priest, as, well, as, a, prophet, elijah, is, also, equated, with, the, archangel, sandalphon, whose, four, wing, beats, will, carry, him, to, any, part, of, the, earth, when, forced, to, choose, between, death, and, dishonor, rabbi, kahana, chose, to, leap, to, his, death, before, he, could, strike, the, ground, elijah, sandalphon, had, appeared, to, catch, him, yet, another, name, for, elijah, is, angel, of, the, covenant, references, to, elijah, in, jewish, folklore, range, from, short, observations, e, g, it, is, said, that, when, dogs, are, happy, for, no, reason, it, is, because, elijah, is, in, the, neighborhood, to, lengthy, parables, on, the, nature, of, god, s, justice, one, such, story, is, that, of, rabbi, joshua, ben, levi, the, rabbi, a, friend, of, elijah, s, was, asked, what, favor, he, might, wish, the, rabbi, answered, only, that, he, be, able, to, join, elijah, in, his, wanderings, elijah, granted, his, wish, only, if, he, refrained, from, asking, any, questions, about, any, of, the, prophet, s, actions, he, agreed, and, they, began, their, journey, the, first, place, they, came, to, was, the, house, of, an, elderly, couple, who, were, so, poor, they, had, only, one, old, cow, the, old, couple, gave, of, their, hospitality, as, best, they, could, the, next, morning, as, the, travelers, left, elijah, prayed, that, the, old, cow, would, die, and, it, did, the, second, place, they, came, to, was, the, home, of, a, wealthy, man, he, had, no, patience, for, his, visitors, and, chased, them, away, with, the, admonition, that, they, should, get, jobs, and, not, beg, from, honest, people, as, they, were, leaving, they, passed, the, man, s, wall, and, saw, that, it, was, crumbling, elijah, prayed, that, the, wall, be, repaired, and, it, was, so, next, they, came, to, a, wealthy, synagogue, they, were, allowed, to, spend, the, night, with, only, the, smallest, of, provisions, when, they, left, elijah, prayed, that, every, member, of, the, synagogue, might, become, a, leader, finally, they, came, to, a, very, poor, synagogue, here, they, were, treated, with, great, courtesy, and, hospitality, when, they, left, elijah, prayed, that, god, might, give, them, a, single, wise, leader, at, this, rabbi, joshua, could, no, longer, hold, back, he, demanded, of, elijah, an, explanation, of, his, actions, at, the, house, of, the, old, couple, elijah, knew, that, the, angel, of, death, was, coming, for, the, old, woman, so, he, prayed, that, god, might, have, the, angel, take, the, cow, instead, at, the, house, of, the, wealthy, man, there, was, a, great, treasure, hidden, in, the, crumbling, wall, elijah, prayed, that, the, wall, be, restored, thus, keeping, the, treasure, away, from, the, miser, the, story, ends, with, a, moral, a, synagogue, with, many, leaders, will, be, ruined, by, many, arguments, a, town, with, a, single, wise, leader, will, be, guided, to, success, and, prosperity, know, then, that, if, thou, seest, an, evil, doer, prosper, it, is, not, always, unto, his, advantage, and, if, a, righteous, man, suffers, need, and, distress, think, not, god, is, unjust, the, elijah, of, legend, did, not, lose, any, of, his, ability, to, afflict, the, comfortable, the, case, of, rabbi, eliezer, son, of, rabbi, simon, ben, yohai, is, illustrative, once, when, walking, on, a, beach, he, came, upon, a, hideously, ugly, man, the, prophet, in, disguise, the, man, greeted, him, courteously, peace, be, with, thee, rabbi, instead, of, returning, the, greeting, the, rabbi, could, not, resist, an, insult, how, ugly, you, are, is, there, anyone, as, ugly, as, you, in, your, town, elijah, responded, with, i, don, t, know, perhaps, you, should, tell, the, master, architect, how, ugly, is, this, his, construction, the, rabbi, realized, his, wrong, and, asked, for, pardon, but, elijah, would, not, give, it, until, the, entire, city, had, asked, for, forgiveness, for, the, rabbi, and, the, rabbi, had, promised, to, mend, his, ways, elijah, was, always, seen, as, deeply, pious, it, seems, only, natural, that, he, would, be, pitted, against, an, equally, evil, individual, this, was, found, in, the, person, of, lilith, lilith, in, legend, was, the, first, wife, of, adam, she, rebelled, against, adam, the, angels, and, even, god, she, came, to, be, seen, as, a, demon, and, a, witch, elijah, encountered, lilith, and, instantly, recognized, and, challenged, her, unclean, one, where, are, you, going, unable, to, avoid, or, lie, to, the, prophet, she, admitted, she, was, on, her, way, to, the, house, of, a, pregnant, woman, her, intention, was, to, kill, the, woman, and, eat, the, child, elijah, pronounced, his, malediction, i, curse, you, in, the, name, of, the, lord, be, silent, as, a, stone, but, lilith, was, able, to, make, a, bargain, with, elijah, she, promises, to, forsake, my, evil, ways, if, elijah, will, remove, his, curse, to, seal, the, bargain, she, gives, elijah, her, names, so, that, they, can, be, posted, in, the, houses, of, pregnant, women, or, new, born, children, or, used, as, amulets, lilith, promises, where, i, see, those, names, i, shall, run, away, at, once, neither, the, child, nor, the, mother, will, ever, be, injured, by, me, in, the, new, testament, jesus, would, say, for, those, who, believed, john, the, baptist, was, elijah, who, would, come, before, the, great, and, terrible, day, as, predicted, by, malachi, some, english, translations, of, the, new, testament, use, elias, a, greek, form, of, the, name, in, the, king, james, version, elias, appears, only, in, the, texts, translated, from, greek, john, the, baptist, preached, a, message, of, repentance, and, baptism, he, predicted, the, day, of, judgment, using, imagery, similar, to, that, of, malachi, he, also, preached, that, the, messiah, was, coming, all, of, this, was, done, in, a, style, that, immediately, recalled, the, image, of, elijah, to, his, audience, he, wore, a, coat, of, camel, s, hair, secured, with, a, leather, girdle, he, also, frequently, preached, in, wilderness, areas, near, the, jordan, river, in, the, gospel, of, john, when, john, the, baptist, was, asked, by, a, delegation, of, priests, present, tense, art, thou, elias, he, replied, i, am, not, matthew, 11, 14, and, matthew, 17, 10, 13, however, make, it, clear, that, john, was, the, spiritual, successor, to, elijah, in, the, nativity, of, st, john, the, baptist, in, luke, gabriel, appears, to, zechariah, john, s, father, and, told, him, that, john, will, turn, many, of, the, sons, of, israel, to, the, lord, their, god, and, that, he, will, go, forth, in, the, spirit, and, power, of, elijah, elijah, makes, an, appearance, in, the, new, testament, during, an, incident, known, as, the, transfiguration, at, the, summit, of, an, unnamed, mount, jesus, face, begins, to, shine, the, disciples, who, are, with, him, hear, the, voice, of, god, announce, that, jesus, is, my, beloved, son, the, disciples, also, see, moses, and, elijah, appear, and, talk, with, jesus, this, apparently, relates, to, how, both, elijah, and, moses, the, latter, according, to, tradition, but, not, the, bible, both, were, translated, to, heaven, instead, of, dying, peter, is, so, struck, by, the, experience, that, he, asks, jesus, if, they, should, build, three, tabernacles, one, for, elijah, one, for, jesus, and, one, for, moses, there, is, agreement, among, some, christian, theologians, that, elijah, appears, to, hand, over, the, responsibility, of, the, prophets, to, jesus, as, the, woman, by, the, well, said, to, jesus, i, perceive, thou, art, a, prophet, moses, also, likewise, came, to, hand, over, the, responsibility, of, the, law, for, the, divinely, announced, son, of, god, elijah, is, mentioned, four, more, times, in, the, new, testament, in, luke, romans, hebrews, and, james, in, luke, 4, 24, 27, jesus, uses, elijah, as, an, example, of, rejected, prophets, jesus, says, no, prophet, is, accepted, in, his, own, country, and, then, mentions, elijah, saying, that, there, were, many, widows, in, israel, but, elijah, was, sent, to, one, in, phoenicia, in, romans, 11, 1, 6, paul, cites, elijah, as, an, example, of, god, s, never, forsaking, his, people, the, israelites, hebrews, 11, 35, women, received, their, dead, raised, to, life, again, refers, to, both, elijah, raising, the, son, of, the, widow, of, zarephath, and, elisha, raising, the, son, of, the, woman, of, shunem, citing, both, elijah, and, elisha, as, old, testament, examples, of, faith, in, james, 5, 16, 18, james, says, the, effectual, fervent, prayer, of, a, righteous, man, availeth, much, and, then, cites, elijah, s, prayers, which, started, and, ended, the, famine, in, israel, as, examples, in, western, christianity, elijah, is, commemorated, as, a, saint, with, a, feast, day, on, 20, july, by, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, lutheran, church, missouri, synod, catholics, believe, that, he, was, unmarried, and, celibate, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, those, eastern, catholic, churches, which, follow, the, byzantine, rite, he, is, commemorated, on, the, same, date, in, the, 21st, century, julian, calendar, 20, july, corresponds, to, gregorian, calendar, 2, august, he, is, greatly, revered, among, the, orthodox, as, a, model, of, the, contemplative, life, he, is, also, commemorated, on, the, orthodox, liturgical, calendar, on, the, sunday, of, the, holy, fathers, the, sunday, before, the, nativity, of, the, lord, elijah, has, been, venerated, as, the, patron, saint, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, since, 26, august, 1752, replacing, george, of, lydda, at, the, request, of, bishop, pavao, dragi, evi, the, reasons, for, the, replacement, are, unclear, it, has, been, suggested, that, elijah, was, chosen, because, of, his, importance, to, all, three, main, religious, groups, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, catholics, muslims, and, orthodox, christians, pope, benedict, xiv, is, said, to, have, approved, bishop, dragi, evi, s, request, with, the, remark, that, a, wild, nation, deserved, a, wild, patron, prophet, elias, is, commemorated, by, the, catholic, church, on, 17, june, he, is, also, commemorated, by, eastern, orthodox, church, on, april, 14, with, all, saint, sinai, monks, elijah, is, revered, as, the, spiritual, father, and, traditional, founder, of, the, catholic, religious, order, of, carmelites, in, addition, to, taking, their, name, from, mt, carmel, where, the, first, hermits, of, the, order, established, themselves, the, calced, carmelite, and, discalced, carmelite, traditions, pertaining, to, elijah, focus, upon, the, prophet, s, withdrawal, from, public, life, the, medieval, carmelite, book, of, the, first, monks, offers, some, insight, into, the, heart, of, the, orders, contemplative, vocation, and, reverence, for, the, prophet, in, the, 17th, century, the, bollandist, society, whose, declared, aim, was, to, search, out, and, classify, materials, concerning, the, saints, venerated, by, the, church, and, to, print, what, seemed, to, be, the, most, reliable, sources, of, information, entered, into, controversy, with, the, carmelites, on, this, point, in, writing, of, st, albert, patriarch, of, jerusalem, and, author, of, the, carmelite, rule, the, bollandist, daniel, papebroch, stated, that, the, attribution, of, carmelite, origin, to, elijah, was, insufficiently, grounded, the, carmelites, reacted, strongly, from, 1681, to, 1698, a, series, of, letters, pamphlets, and, other, documents, was, issued, by, each, side, the, carmelites, were, supported, by, a, spanish, tribunal, while, the, bollandists, had, the, support, of, jean, de, launoy, and, the, sorbonne, in, november, 1698, pope, innocent, xii, ordered, an, end, to, the, controversy, since, most, eastern, churches, either, use, greek, as, their, liturgical, language, or, translated, their, liturgies, from, the, greek, elias, or, its, modern, iotacized, form, ilias, is, the, form, of, the, prophet, s, name, used, among, most, members, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, those, eastern, catholic, churches, which, follow, the, byzantine, rite, the, feast, day, of, saint, elias, falls, on, 20, july, of, the, orthodox, liturgical, calendar, for, those, churches, which, follow, the, traditional, julian, calendar, 20, july, currently, falls, on, 2, august, of, the, modern, gregorian, calendar, this, day, is, a, major, holiday, in, lebanon, and, is, one, of, a, handful, of, holidays, there, whose, celebration, is, accompanied, by, a, launching, of, fireworks, by, the, general, public, the, full, name, of, st, elias, in, lebanon, translates, to, st, elias, the, living, because, it, is, believed, that, he, did, not, die, but, rode, his, fiery, chariot, to, heaven, the, reference, to, the, fiery, chariot, is, likely, why, the, lebanese, celebrate, this, holiday, with, fireworks, elias, is, also, commemorated, together, with, all, of, the, righteous, persons, of, the, old, testament, on, the, sunday, of, the, holy, fathers, the, sunday, before, the, nativity, of, the, lord, the, apolytikion, in, the, fourth, tone, for, st, elias, the, incarnate, angel, the, cornerstone, of, the, prophets, the, second, forerunner, of, the, coming, of, christ, the, glorious, elias, who, from, above, sent, down, to, elisha, the, grace, to, dispel, sickness, and, cleanse, lepers, abounds, therefore, in, healing, for, those, who, honor, him, the, kontakion, in, the, second, tone, for, st, elias, o, prophet, and, foreseer, of, the, great, works, of, god, o, greatly, renowned, elias, who, by, your, word, held, back, the, clouds, of, rain, intercede, for, us, to, the, only, loving, one, starting, in, the, fifth, century, elias, is, often, connected, with, helios, the, sun, the, two, words, have, very, similar, pronunciations, in, post, classical, greek, elijah, rode, in, his, chariot, of, fire, to, heaven, just, as, helios, drove, the, chariot, of, the, sun, across, the, sky, and, the, holocaust, sacrifice, offered, by, elijah, and, burned, by, fire, from, heaven, corresponds, to, the, sun, warming, the, earth, sedulius, writes, poetically, in, the, fifth, century, that, the, bright, path, to, glittering, heaven, suits, elias, both, in, merits, and, name, as, changing, one, letter, makes, his, name, helios, but, he, does, not, identify, the, two, a, homily, entitled, de, ascensione, heliae, misattributed, to, chrysostom, claims, that, poets, and, painters, use, the, ascension, of, elijah, as, a, model, for, their, depictions, of, the, sun, and, says, that, elijah, is, really, helios, saint, patrick, appears, to, conflate, helios, and, elias, in, modern, times, much, greek, folklore, also, connects, elias, with, the, sun, in, greece, chapels, and, monasteries, dedicated, to, prophet, elias, are, often, found, on, mountaintops, which, themselves, are, often, named, after, him, since, wachsmuth, 1864, the, usual, explanation, for, this, has, been, that, elias, was, identified, with, helios, who, had, mountaintop, shrines, but, few, shrines, of, helios, were, on, mountaintops, and, sun, worship, was, subsumed, by, apollo, worship, by, christian, times, and, so, could, not, be, confused, with, elias, the, modern, folklore, is, not, good, evidence, for, the, origin, of, the, association, of, the, sun, elias, and, mountaintops, perhaps, elias, is, simply, a, natural, patron, of, high, places, the, association, of, elias, with, mountaintops, seems, to, come, from, a, different, pagan, tradition, elias, took, on, the, attributes, and, the, locales, associated, with, zeus, especially, his, associations, with, mountains, and, his, powers, over, rain, thunder, lightning, and, wind, when, elias, prevailed, over, the, priests, of, baal, it, was, on, mount, carmel, which, later, became, known, as, mount, st, elias, when, he, spent, forty, days, in, a, cave, it, was, on, mount, horeb, when, elias, confronted, ahab, he, stopped, the, rains, for, three, years, a, map, of, mountain, cults, of, zeus, shows, that, most, of, these, sites, are, now, dedicated, to, elias, including, mount, olympus, mount, lykaion, mount, arachnaion, and, mount, taleton, on, the, mainland, and, mount, kenaion, mount, oche, and, mount, kynados, in, the, islands, of, these, the, only, one, with, a, recorded, tradition, of, a, helios, cult, is, mount, taleton, elias, is, associated, with, pre, christian, lightning, gods, in, many, other, european, traditions, among, albanians, pilgrimages, are, made, to, mountaintops, to, ask, for, rain, during, the, summer, one, such, tradition, that, is, gaining, popularity, is, the, 2, august, pilgrimage, to, ljuboten, on, the, sharr, mountains, muslims, refer, to, this, day, as, aligjyn, ali, day, and, it, is, believed, that, ali, becomes, elias, at, midday, as, elijah, was, described, as, ascending, into, heaven, in, a, fiery, chariot, the, christian, missionaries, who, converted, slavic, tribes, likely, found, him, an, ideal, analogy, for, perun, the, supreme, slavic, god, of, storms, thunder, and, lightning, bolts, in, many, slavic, countries, elijah, is, known, as, elijah, the, thunderer, ilija, gromovnik, who, drives, the, heavens, in, a, chariot, and, administers, rain, and, snow, thus, actually, taking, the, place, of, perun, in, popular, beliefs, perun, is, also, sometimes, conflated, with, the, legendary, hero, elijah, of, murom, the, feast, of, st, elias, is, known, as, ilinden, in, south, slavic, and, was, chosen, as, the, day, of, the, ilinden, preobrazhenie, uprising, in, 1903, it, is, now, the, holiday, of, republic, day, in, north, macedonia, in, estonian, folklore, elijah, is, considered, to, be, the, successor, of, ukko, the, lightning, spirit, in, georgian, mythology, he, replaces, elwa, a, georgian, story, about, elijah, once, jesus, the, prophet, elijah, and, st, george, were, going, through, georgia, when, they, became, tired, and, hungry, they, stopped, to, dine, they, saw, a, georgian, shepherd, and, decided, to, ask, him, to, feed, them, first, elijah, went, up, to, the, shepherd, and, asked, him, for, a, sheep, after, the, shepherd, asked, his, identity, elijah, said, that, he, was, the, one, who, sent, him, rain, to, get, him, a, good, profit, from, farming, the, shepherd, became, angry, at, him, and, told, him, that, he, was, the, one, who, also, sent, thunderstorms, which, destroyed, the, farms, of, poor, widows, after, elijah, jesus, and, st, george, attempt, to, get, help, and, eventually, succeed, among, other, peoples, of, the, caucasus, including, the, ossetians, and, kabardians, elijah, is, understood, as, a, kind, of, thunder, divinity, named, uac, illa, ilia, or, yeli, and, was, traditionally, invoked, in, choppa, ritual, associated, with, lightning, strikes, and, certain, mental, illnesses, if, a, person, or, animal, was, struck, by, lightning, a, circle, dance, was, performed, immediately, around, the, site, even, if, the, storm, was, still, ongoing, and, elijah, s, name, was, invoked, alongside, a, nonsense, word, choppa, or, coppay, if, the, victim, had, died, their, family, were, forbidden, from, grieving, and, were, required, to, bury, them, where, they, fell, instead, of, in, the, village, cemetery, if, the, victim, survived, their, lives, were, dedicated, to, elijah, human, survivors, were, prophets, while, animals, were, released, with, a, mark, so, that, others, would, know, not, to, take, them, home, in, other, versions, of, this, tradition, the, one, venerated, was, not, elijah, but, other, traditional, thunder, divinities, like, shyble, afy, or, antswa, elias, has, other, pagan, associations, a, modern, legend, about, elias, mirrors, precisely, the, legend, of, odysseus, seeking, a, place, where, the, locals, would, not, recognize, an, oar, hence, the, mountaintops, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, acknowledges, elijah, as, a, prophet, the, church, teaches, that, the, malachi, prophecy, of, the, return, of, elijah, was, fulfilled, on, 3, april, 1836, when, elijah, visited, the, prophet, and, founder, of, the, church, joseph, smith, along, with, oliver, cowdery, in, the, kirtland, temple, as, a, resurrected, being, this, event, is, chronicled, in, doctrine, and, covenants, 110, 13, 16, this, experience, forms, the, basis, for, the, church, s, focus, on, genealogy, and, family, history, and, belief, in, the, eternal, nature, of, marriage, and, families, in, latter, day, saint, theology, the, name, title, elias, is, not, always, synonymous, with, elijah, and, is, often, used, for, people, other, than, the, biblical, prophet, according, to, joseph, smith, the, spirit, of, elias, is, first, elijah, second, and, messiah, last, elias, is, a, forerunner, to, prepare, the, way, and, the, spirit, and, power, of, elijah, is, to, come, after, holding, the, keys, of, power, building, the, temple, to, the, capstone, placing, the, seals, of, the, melchizedek, priesthood, upon, the, house, of, israel, and, making, all, things, ready, then, messiah, comes, to, his, temple, which, is, last, of, all, people, to, whom, the, title, elias, is, applied, in, mormonism, include, noah, the, angel, gabriel, who, is, considered, to, be, the, same, person, as, noah, in, mormon, doctrine, elijah, john, the, baptist, john, the, apostle, and, an, unspecified, man, who, was, a, contemporary, of, abraham, detractors, of, mormonism, have, often, alleged, that, smith, in, whose, time, and, place, the, king, james, version, was, the, only, available, english, translation, of, the, bible, simply, failed, to, grasp, the, fact, that, the, elijah, of, the, old, testament, and, the, elias, of, the, new, testament, are, the, same, person, latter, day, saints, deny, this, and, say, that, the, difference, they, make, between, the, two, is, deliberate, and, prophetic, the, names, elias, and, elijah, refer, to, one, who, prepares, the, way, for, the, coming, of, the, lord, this, is, applicable, to, john, the, baptist, coming, to, prepare, the, way, for, the, lord, and, his, baptism, it, also, refers, to, elijah, appearing, during, the, transfiguration, to, prepare, for, jesus, by, restoring, keys, of, sealing, power, jesus, then, gave, this, power, to, the, twelve, saying, verily, i, say, unto, you, whatsoever, ye, shall, bind, on, earth, shall, be, bound, in, heaven, and, whatsoever, ye, shall, loose, on, earth, shall, be, loosed, in, heaven, elijah, arabic, romanized, ily, s, is, mentioned, as, a, prophet, in, quran, 6, 85, elijah, s, narrative, in, the, quran, and, later, muslim, tradition, resembles, closely, that, in, the, hebrew, bible, and, muslim, literature, records, elijah, s, primary, prophesying, as, taking, place, during, the, reign, of, ahab, and, jezebel, as, well, as, ahaziah, he, is, seen, by, muslims, to, be, the, prophetic, predecessor, to, elisha, while, neither, the, bible, nor, the, quran, mentions, the, genealogy, of, elijah, some, scholars, of, islam, believe, he, may, have, come, from, the, priestly, family, of, the, prophet, aaron, while, elijah, is, associated, with, islamic, eschatology, islam, views, jesus, as, the, messiah, however, elijah, is, expected, to, come, back, along, with, the, mysterious, figure, known, as, khidr, during, the, last, judgment, elijah, s, figure, has, been, identified, with, a, number, of, other, prophets, and, saints, including, idris, which, is, believed, by, some, scholars, to, have, been, another, name, for, elijah, and, khidr, islamic, legend, later, developed, the, figure, of, elijah, greatly, embellishing, upon, his, attributes, and, some, apocryphal, literature, gave, elijah, the, status, of, a, half, human, half, angel, elijah, also, appears, in, later, works, of, literature, including, the, hamzanama, elijah, is, mentioned, in, the, quran, where, his, preaching, is, recounted, in, a, concise, manner, the, quran, narrates, that, elijah, told, his, people, to, come, to, the, worship, of, god, and, to, leave, the, worship, of, baal, the, primary, idol, of, the, area, the, quran, states, and, elias, was, indeed, one, of, the, messengers, remember, when, he, said, to, his, people, will, you, not, fear, allah, do, you, call, upon, the, idol, of, ba, l, and, abandon, the, best, of, creators, allah, your, lord, and, the, lord, of, your, forefathers, the, quran, makes, it, clear, that, the, majority, of, elijah, s, people, denied, the, prophet, and, continued, to, follow, idolatry, however, it, mentions, that, a, small, number, of, devoted, servants, of, god, among, them, followed, elijah, and, believed, in, and, worshiped, god, the, quran, states, but, they, rejected, him, so, they, will, certainly, be, brought, for, punishment, but, not, the, chosen, servants, of, allah, we, blessed, him, with, honourable, mention, among, later, generations, in, the, quran, god, praises, elijah, in, two, places, peace, be, upon, elias, indeed, this, is, how, we, reward, the, good, doers, he, was, truly, one, of, our, faithful, servants, likewise, we, guided, zachariah, john, jesus, and, elias, who, were, all, of, the, righteous, numerous, commentators, including, abdullah, yusuf, ali, have, offered, commentary, on, vi, 85, saying, that, elijah, zechariah, john, the, baptist, and, jesus, were, all, spiritually, connected, abdullah, yusuf, ali, says, the, third, group, consists, not, of, men, of, action, but, preachers, of, truth, who, led, solitary, lives, their, epithet, is, the, righteous, they, form, a, connected, group, round, jesus, zachariah, was, the, father, of, john, the, baptist, who, is, referenced, as, elias, which, was, for, to, come, matt, 11, 14, and, elias, is, said, to, have, been, present, and, talked, to, jesus, at, the, transfiguration, on, the, mount, matt, 17, 3, muslim, literature, and, tradition, recounts, that, elijah, preached, to, the, kingdom, of, israel, ruled, over, by, ahab, and, later, his, son, ahaziah, he, is, believed, to, have, been, a, prophet, of, the, desert, like, john, the, baptist, elijah, is, believed, to, have, preached, with, zeal, to, ahab, and, his, wife, jezebel, who, according, to, muslim, tradition, was, partly, responsible, for, the, worship, of, false, idols, in, this, area, muslims, believe, that, it, was, because, the, majority, of, people, refused, to, listen, to, elijah, that, elisha, had, to, continue, preaching, the, message, of, god, to, israel, after, him, elijah, has, been, the, subject, of, legends, and, folktales, in, muslim, culture, usually, involving, his, meeting, with, khidr, and, in, one, legend, with, muhammad, himself, in, islamic, mysticism, elijah, is, associated, closely, with, the, sage, khidr, one, hadith, reported, that, elijah, and, khidr, met, together, every, year, in, jerusalem, to, go, on, the, pilgrimage, to, mecca, elijah, appears, also, in, the, hamzanama, numerous, times, where, he, is, spoken, of, as, being, the, brother, of, khidr, as, well, as, one, who, drank, from, the, fountain, of, youth, further, it, is, narrated, in, kitab, al, kafi, that, imam, ja, far, al, sadiq, was, reciting, the, prostration, of, ilyas, elijah, in, the, syrian, language, and, began, to, weep, he, then, translated, the, supplication, in, arabic, to, a, group, of, visiting, scholars, o, lord, will, i, find, that, you, punish, me, although, you, know, of, my, thirst, in, the, heat, of, midday, will, i, find, that, you, punish, me, although, you, know, that, i, rub, my, face, on, earth, to, worship, you, will, i, find, that, you, punish, me, although, you, know, that, i, give, up, sins, for, you, will, i, find, that, you, punish, me, although, you, know, that, i, stay, awake, all, night, just, for, you, to, which, allah, then, inspired, to, ilyas, raise, your, head, from, the, earth, for, i, will, not, punish, you, although, most, muslim, scholars, believed, that, elijah, preached, in, israel, some, early, commentators, on, the, quran, stated, that, elijah, was, sent, to, baalbek, in, lebanon, modern, scholars, have, rejected, this, claim, stating, that, the, connection, of, the, city, with, elijah, would, have, been, made, because, of, the, first, half, of, the, city, s, name, that, of, baal, which, was, the, deity, that, elijah, exhorted, his, people, to, stop, worshiping, scholars, who, reject, identification, of, elijah, s, town, with, baalbek, further, argue, that, the, town, of, baalbek, is, not, mentioned, with, the, narrative, of, elijah, in, either, the, quran, or, the, hebrew, bible, druze, tradition, honors, several, mentors, and, prophets, and, elijah, is, honored, as, a, prophet, druze, venerate, elijah, and, he, is, considered, a, central, figure, in, druzism, and, due, to, his, importance, in, druzism, the, settlement, of, druze, on, mount, carmel, had, partly, to, do, with, elijah, s, story, and, devotion, there, are, two, large, druze, towns, on, the, eastern, slopes, of, mount, carmel, daliyat, al, karmel, and, isfiya, the, druze, regard, the, cave, of, elijah, as, holy, and, they, identify, elijah, as, al, khidr, the, green, prophet, who, symbolizes, water, and, life, a, miracle, who, cures, the, sick, he, and, jethro, shuaib, are, considered, patron, saints, of, the, druze, people, druze, like, some, christians, believe, that, elijah, came, back, as, john, the, baptist, since, they, believe, in, reincarnation, and, the, transmigration, of, the, soul, druze, believe, that, el, khidr, and, john, the, baptist, are, one, and, the, same, along, with, saint, george, due, to, the, christian, influence, on, the, druze, faith, two, christian, saints, become, the, druze, s, favorite, venerated, figures, saint, george, and, saint, elijah, thus, in, all, the, villages, inhabited, by, druze, and, christians, in, central, mount, lebanon, a, christian, church, or, druze, maqam, is, dedicated, to, either, one, of, them, according, to, scholar, ray, jabre, mouawad, the, druze, appreciated, the, two, saints, for, their, bravery, saint, george, because, he, confronted, the, dragon, and, saint, elijah, because, he, competed, with, the, pagan, priests, of, baal, and, won, over, them, in, both, cases, the, explanations, provided, by, christians, is, that, druzes, were, attracted, to, warrior, saints, that, resemble, their, own, militarized, society, in, the, bah, faith, the, b, b, founder, of, the, b, b, faith, is, believed, to, be, the, return, of, elijah, and, john, the, baptist, both, elijah, and, john, the, baptist, are, considered, to, be, lesser, prophets, whose, stations, are, below, that, of, a, manifestation, of, god, like, jesus, christ, buddha, the, b, b, or, bah, u, ll, h, the, b, b, is, buried, on, mount, carmel, where, elijah, had, his, confrontation, with, the, prophets, of, baal, that, ravens, fed, elijah, by, the, brook, chorath, has, been, questioned, the, hebrew, text, at, 1, kings, 17, 4, 6, uses, the, word, rv, m, which, means, ravens, but, with, a, different, vocalization, might, equally, mean, arabs, the, septuagint, has, ravens, and, other, traditional, translations, followed, alternatives, have, been, proposed, for, many, years, for, example, adam, clarke, d, 1832, treated, it, as, a, discussion, already, of, long, standing, objections, to, the, traditional, translation, are, that, ravens, are, ritually, unclean, as, well, as, physically, dirty, it, is, difficult, to, imagine, any, method, of, delivery, of, the, food, which, is, not, disgusting, the, parallelism, with, the, incident, that, follows, where, elijah, is, fed, by, the, widow, also, suggests, a, human, if, mildly, improbable, agent, prof, john, gray, chooses, arabs, saying, we, adopt, this, reading, solely, because, of, its, congruity, with, the, sequel, where, elijah, is, fed, by, an, alien, phoenician, woman, his, translation, of, the, verses, in, question, is, and, the, word, of, yhwh, came, to, elijah, saying, go, hence, and, turn, eastward, and, hide, thyself, in, the, wadi, chorath, east, of, the, jordan, and, it, shall, be, that, thou, shalt, drink, of, the, wadi, and, i, have, commanded, the, arabs, to, feed, thee, there, and, he, went, and, did, according, to, the, word, of, yhwh, and, went, and, dwelt, in, the, wadi, chorath, east, of, the, jordan, and, the, arabs, brought, him, bread, in, the, morning, and, flesh, in, the, evening, and, he, would, drink, of, the, wadi, the, challenge, to, the, priests, of, baal, had, the, two, fold, purpose, of, demonstrating, that, the, god, of, israel, was, greater, than, baal, and, that, it, was, he, who, was, the, giver, of, rain, according, to, j, robinson, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, pouring, of, water, was, a, piece, of, sympathetic, magic, hugo, gressmann, suggested, that, the, fire, that, destroyed, the, offering, and, altar, was, lightning, while, ferdinand, hitzig, and, others, thought, the, water, poured, on, the, sacrifice, and, into, the, ditch, might, have, been, flammable, naphtha, baptist, scholar, h, h, rowley, rejects, both, views, robinson, dismisses, the, suggestion, of, naphtha, with, the, view, that, the, priests, of, baal, would, have, been, aware, of, the, properties, of, naphtha, julian, morgenstern, rejects, the, idea, of, sympathetic, magic, but, supports, the, interpretation, of, white, naphtha, possibly, ignited, by, a, glass, or, mirror, to, focus, the, sun, s, rays, citing, other, mentions, of, sacred, fire, as, in, 2, maccabees, 1, 18, 22, elijah, s, name, typically, occurs, in, jewish, lists, of, those, who, have, entered, heaven, alive, in, the, gospel, of, john, jesus, says, and, no, man, hath, ascended, up, to, heaven, but, he, that, came, down, from, heaven, the, son, of, man, which, is, in, heaven, traditionally, christianity, interprets, the, son, of, man, as, a, title, of, jesus, but, this, has, never, been, an, article, of, faith, and, there, are, other, interpretations, further, interpreting, this, quote, some, christians, believe, that, elijah, was, not, assumed, into, heaven, but, simply, transferred, to, another, assignment, either, in, heaven, or, with, king, jehoram, of, judah, the, question, of, whether, elijah, was, in, heaven, or, elsewhere, on, earth, depends, partly, on, the, view, of, the, letter, jehoram, received, from, elijah, in, 2, chronicles, 21, 12, after, elijah, had, ascended, some, have, suggested, that, the, letter, was, written, before, elijah, ascended, but, only, delivered, later, the, rabbinical, seder, olam, explains, that, the, letter, was, delivered, seven, years, after, his, ascension, this, is, also, a, possible, explanation, for, some, variation, in, manuscripts, of, josephus, antiquities, of, the, jews, when, dealing, with, this, issue, others, have, argued, that, elijah, was, only, caught, away, such, as, philip, in, acts, 8, john, lightfoot, reasoned, that, it, must, have, been, a, different, elijah, the, jewish, nation, awaits, the, coming, of, elijah, to, precede, the, coming, of, the, messiah, for, christians, this, prophecy, was, fulfilled, in, the, gospel, after, elijah, appears, during, the, transfiguration, alongside, moses, jesus, explains, to, his, disciples, that, john, the, baptist, recently, beheaded, by, herod, antipas, had, been, elijah, reincarnate, commentators, have, said, that, moses, appearance, represented, the, law, while, elijah, s, appearance, represented, the, prophets, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, believes, that, elijah, returned, on, 3, april, 1836, in, an, appearance, to, joseph, smith, and, oliver, cowdery, fulfilling, the, prophecy, in, malachi, the, bah, faith, believes, elijah, returned, as, the, biblical, prophet, john, the, baptist, and, as, the, b, b, who, founded, the, b, b, faith, in, 1844, druze, like, bah, faith, believes, believe, that, elijah, came, back, as, john, the, baptist, the, american, founded, nation, of, islam, believes, elijah, returned, as, elijah, muhammad, black, separatist, religious, leader, who, claimed, to, be, a, messenger, not, a, prophet, this, is, considered, less, important, than, their, belief, that, allah, himself, showed, up, in, the, person, of, fard, muhammad, the, founder, of, the, group, it, differs, notably, from, most, beliefs, about, elijah, in, that, his, re, appearance, is, usually, the, precursor, to, a, greater, one, s, appearance, rather, than, an, afterthought
