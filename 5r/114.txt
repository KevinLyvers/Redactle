recognized, by, georgian, orthodox, church, semi, autonomous, an, icon, from, ancient, greek, eik, n, image, resemblance, is, a, religious, work, of, art, most, commonly, a, painting, in, the, cultures, of, the, eastern, orthodox, oriental, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, the, most, common, subjects, include, jesus, mary, saints, and, angels, although, especially, associated, with, portrait, style, images, concentrating, on, one, or, two, main, figures, the, term, also, covers, most, of, the, religious, images, in, a, variety, of, artistic, media, produced, by, eastern, christianity, including, narrative, scenes, usually, from, the, bible, or, the, lives, of, saints, icons, are, most, commonly, painted, on, wood, panels, with, egg, tempera, but, they, may, also, be, cast, in, metal, or, carved, in, stone, or, embroidered, on, cloth, or, done, in, mosaic, or, fresco, work, or, printed, on, paper, or, metal, etc, comparable, images, from, western, christianity, may, be, classified, as, icons, although, iconic, may, also, be, used, to, describe, the, static, style, of, a, devotional, image, in, the, greek, language, the, term, for, icon, painting, uses, the, same, word, as, for, writing, and, orthodox, sources, often, translate, it, into, english, as, icon, writing, eastern, orthodox, tradition, holds, that, the, production, of, christian, images, dates, back, to, the, very, early, days, of, christianity, and, that, it, has, been, a, continuous, tradition, since, then, modern, academic, art, history, considers, that, while, images, may, have, existed, earlier, the, tradition, can, be, traced, back, only, as, far, as, the, 3rd, century, and, that, the, images, which, survive, from, early, christian, art, often, differ, greatly, from, later, ones, the, icons, of, later, centuries, can, be, linked, often, closely, to, images, from, the, 5th, century, onwards, though, very, few, of, these, survive, widespread, destruction, of, images, occurred, during, the, byzantine, iconoclasm, of, 726, 842, although, this, did, settle, permanently, the, question, of, the, appropriateness, of, images, since, then, icons, have, had, a, great, continuity, of, style, and, subject, far, greater, than, in, the, icons, of, the, western, church, at, the, same, time, there, have, been, change, and, development, pre, christian, religions, had, produced, and, used, art, works, statues, and, paintings, of, various, gods, and, deities, were, regularly, worshiped, and, venerated, it, is, unclear, when, christians, took, up, such, activities, christian, tradition, dating, from, the, 8th, century, identifies, luke, the, evangelist, as, the, first, icon, painter, but, this, might, not, reflect, historical, facts, a, general, assumption, that, early, christianity, was, generally, aniconic, opposed, to, religious, imagery, in, both, theory, and, practice, until, about, 200, has, been, challenged, by, paul, corby, finney, s, analysis, of, early, christian, writing, and, material, remains, 1994, his, assumption, distinguishes, three, different, sources, of, attitudes, affecting, early, christians, on, the, issue, first, that, humans, could, have, a, direct, vision, of, god, second, that, they, could, not, and, third, that, although, humans, could, see, god, they, were, best, advised, not, to, look, and, were, strictly, forbidden, to, represent, what, they, had, seen, these, derived, respectively, from, greek, and, near, eastern, pagan, religions, from, ancient, greek, philosophy, and, from, the, jewish, tradition, and, the, old, testament, of, the, three, finney, concludes, that, overall, israel, s, aversion, to, sacred, images, influenced, early, christianity, considerably, less, than, the, greek, philosophical, tradition, of, invisible, deity, apophatically, defined, so, placing, less, emphasis, on, the, jewish, background, of, most, of, the, first, christians, than, most, traditional, accounts, finney, suggests, that, the, reasons, for, the, non, appearance, of, christian, art, before, 200, have, nothing, to, do, with, principled, aversion, to, art, with, other, worldliness, or, with, anti, materialism, the, truth, is, simple, and, mundane, christians, lacked, land, and, capital, art, requires, both, as, soon, as, they, began, to, acquire, land, and, capital, christians, began, to, experiment, with, their, own, distinctive, forms, of, art, aside, from, the, legend, that, pilate, had, made, an, image, of, christ, the, 4th, century, eusebius, of, caesarea, in, his, church, history, provides, a, more, substantial, reference, to, a, first, icon, of, jesus, he, relates, that, king, abgar, of, edessa, died, c, 50, ce, sent, a, letter, to, jesus, at, jerusalem, asking, jesus, to, come, and, heal, him, of, an, illness, this, version, of, the, abgar, story, does, not, mention, an, image, a, later, account, found, in, the, syriac, doctrine, of, addai, c, 400, mentions, a, painted, image, of, jesus, in, the, story, even, later, in, the, 6th, century, account, given, by, evagrius, scholasticus, the, painted, image, transforms, into, an, image, that, miraculously, appeared, on, a, towel, when, christ, pressed, the, cloth, to, his, wet, face, further, legends, relate, that, the, cloth, remained, in, edessa, until, the, 10th, century, when, it, was, taken, by, general, john, kourkouas, to, constantinople, it, went, missing, in, 1204, when, crusaders, sacked, constantinople, but, by, then, numerous, copies, had, firmly, established, its, iconic, type, the, 4th, century, christian, aelius, lampridius, produced, the, earliest, known, written, records, of, christian, images, treated, like, icons, in, a, pagan, or, gnostic, context, in, his, life, of, alexander, severus, xxix, that, formed, part, of, the, augustan, history, according, to, lampridius, the, emperor, alexander, severus, r, 222, 235, himself, not, a, christian, had, kept, a, domestic, chapel, for, the, veneration, of, images, of, deified, emperors, of, portraits, of, his, ancestors, and, of, christ, apollonius, orpheus, and, abraham, saint, irenaeus, c, 130, 202, in, his, against, heresies, 1, 25, 6, says, scornfully, of, the, gnostic, carpocratians, they, also, possess, images, some, of, them, painted, and, others, formed, from, different, kinds, of, material, while, they, maintain, that, a, likeness, of, christ, was, made, by, pilate, at, that, time, when, jesus, lived, among, them, they, crown, these, images, and, set, them, up, along, with, the, images, of, the, philosophers, of, the, world, that, is, to, say, with, the, images, of, pythagoras, and, plato, and, aristotle, and, the, rest, they, have, also, other, modes, of, honouring, these, images, after, the, same, manner, of, the, gentiles, on, the, other, hand, irenaeus, does, not, speak, critically, of, icons, or, portraits, in, a, general, sense, only, of, certain, gnostic, sectarians, use, of, icons, another, criticism, of, image, veneration, appears, in, the, non, canonical, 2nd, century, acts, of, john, generally, considered, a, gnostic, work, in, which, the, apostle, john, discovers, that, one, of, his, followers, has, had, a, portrait, made, of, him, and, is, venerating, it, went, into, the, bedchamber, and, saw, the, portrait, of, an, old, man, crowned, with, garlands, and, lamps, and, altars, set, before, it, and, he, called, him, and, said, lycomedes, what, do, you, mean, by, this, matter, of, the, portrait, can, it, be, one, of, thy, gods, that, is, painted, here, for, i, see, that, you, are, still, living, in, heathen, fashion, later, in, the, passage, john, says, but, this, that, you, have, now, done, is, childish, and, imperfect, you, have, drawn, a, dead, likeness, of, the, dead, at, least, some, of, the, hierarchy, of, the, christian, churches, still, strictly, opposed, icons, in, the, early, 4th, century, at, the, spanish, non, ecumenical, synod, of, elvira, c, 305, bishops, concluded, pictures, are, not, to, be, placed, in, churches, so, that, they, do, not, become, objects, of, worship, and, adoration, bishop, epiphanius, of, salamis, wrote, his, letter, 51, to, john, bishop, of, jerusalem, c, 394, in, which, he, recounted, how, he, tore, down, an, image, in, a, church, and, admonished, the, other, bishop, that, such, images, are, opposed, to, our, religion, elsewhere, in, his, church, history, eusebius, reports, seeing, what, he, took, to, be, portraits, of, jesus, peter, and, paul, and, also, mentions, a, bronze, statue, at, banias, paneas, under, mount, hermon, of, which, he, wrote, they, say, that, this, statue, is, an, image, of, jesus, further, he, relates, that, locals, regarded, the, image, as, a, memorial, of, the, healing, of, the, woman, with, an, issue, of, blood, by, jesus, luke, 8, 43, 48, because, it, depicted, a, standing, man, wearing, a, double, cloak, and, with, arm, outstretched, and, a, woman, kneeling, before, him, with, arms, reaching, out, as, if, in, supplication, john, francis, wilson, suggests, the, possibility, that, this, refers, to, a, pagan, bronze, statue, whose, true, identity, had, been, forgotten, some, have, thought, it, to, represent, aesculapius, the, greek, god, of, healing, but, the, description, of, the, standing, figure, and, the, woman, kneeling, in, supplication, precisely, matches, images, found, on, coins, depicting, the, bearded, emperor, hadrian, r, 117, 138, reaching, out, to, a, female, figure, symbolizing, a, province, kneeling, before, him, when, asked, by, constantia, emperor, constantine, s, half, sister, for, an, image, of, jesus, eusebius, denied, the, request, replying, to, depict, purely, the, human, form, of, christ, before, its, transformation, on, the, other, hand, is, to, break, the, commandment, of, god, and, to, fall, into, pagan, error, hence, jaroslav, pelikan, calls, eusebius, the, father, of, iconoclasm, after, the, emperor, constantine, i, extended, official, toleration, of, christianity, within, the, roman, empire, in, 313, huge, numbers, of, pagans, became, converts, this, period, of, the, historiography, of, christianization, of, the, roman, empire, probably, saw, the, use, of, christian, images, become, very, widespread, among, the, faithful, though, with, great, differences, from, pagan, habits, robin, lane, fox, states, by, the, early, fifth, century, we, know, of, the, ownership, of, private, icons, of, saints, by, c, 480, 500, we, can, be, sure, that, the, inside, of, a, saint, s, shrine, would, be, adorned, with, images, and, votive, portraits, a, practice, which, had, probably, begun, earlier, when, constantine, himself, r, 306, 337, apparently, converted, to, christianity, the, majority, of, his, subjects, remained, pagans, the, roman, imperial, cult, of, the, divinity, of, the, emperor, expressed, through, the, traditional, burning, of, candles, and, the, offering, of, incense, to, the, emperor, s, image, was, tolerated, for, a, period, because, it, would, have, been, politically, dangerous, to, attempt, to, suppress, it, in, the, 5th, century, the, courts, of, justice, and, municipal, buildings, of, the, empire, still, honoured, the, portrait, of, the, reigning, emperor, in, this, way, in, 425, philostorgius, an, allegedly, arian, christian, charged, the, orthodox, christians, in, constantinople, with, idolatry, because, they, still, honored, the, image, of, the, emperor, constantine, the, great, in, this, way, dix, notes, that, this, occurred, more, than, a, century, before, the, first, extant, reference, to, a, similar, honouring, of, the, image, of, jesus, or, of, his, apostles, or, saints, known, today, but, that, it, would, seem, a, natural, progression, for, the, image, of, christ, the, king, of, heaven, and, earth, to, be, paid, similar, veneration, as, that, given, to, the, earthly, roman, emperor, however, the, orthodox, eastern, catholics, and, other, groups, insist, on, explicitly, distinguishing, the, veneration, of, icons, from, the, worship, of, idols, by, pagans, see, further, below, on, the, doctrine, of, veneration, as, opposed, to, worship, after, adoption, of, christianity, as, the, only, permissible, roman, state, religion, under, theodosius, i, christian, art, began, to, change, not, only, in, quality, and, sophistication, but, also, in, nature, this, was, in, no, small, part, due, to, christians, being, free, for, the, first, time, to, express, their, faith, openly, without, persecution, from, the, state, in, addition, to, the, faith, spreading, to, the, non, poor, segments, of, society, paintings, of, martyrs, and, their, feats, began, to, appear, and, early, writers, commented, on, their, lifelike, effect, one, of, the, elements, a, few, christian, writers, criticized, in, pagan, art, the, ability, to, imitate, life, the, writers, mostly, criticized, pagan, works, of, art, for, pointing, to, false, gods, thus, encouraging, idolatry, statues, in, the, round, were, avoided, as, being, too, close, to, the, principal, artistic, focus, of, pagan, cult, practices, as, they, have, continued, to, be, with, some, small, scale, exceptions, throughout, the, history, of, eastern, christianity, nilus, of, sinai, d, c, 430, in, his, letter, to, heliodorus, silentiarius, records, a, miracle, in, which, saint, plato, of, ankyra, appeared, to, a, christian, in, a, dream, the, saint, was, recognized, because, the, young, man, had, often, seen, his, portrait, this, recognition, of, a, religious, apparition, from, likeness, to, an, image, was, also, a, characteristic, of, pagan, pious, accounts, of, appearances, of, gods, to, humans, and, was, a, regular, topos, in, hagiography, one, critical, recipient, of, a, vision, from, saint, demetrius, of, thessaloniki, apparently, specified, that, the, saint, resembled, the, more, ancient, images, of, him, presumably, the, 7th, century, mosaics, still, in, hagios, demetrios, another, an, african, bishop, had, been, rescued, from, arab, slavery, by, a, young, soldier, called, demetrios, who, told, him, to, go, to, his, house, in, thessaloniki, having, discovered, that, most, young, soldiers, in, the, city, seemed, to, be, called, demetrios, he, gave, up, and, went, to, the, largest, church, in, the, city, to, find, his, rescuer, on, the, wall, during, this, period, the, church, began, to, discourage, all, non, religious, human, images, the, emperor, and, donor, figures, counting, as, religious, this, became, largely, effective, so, that, most, of, the, population, would, only, ever, see, religious, images, and, those, of, the, ruling, class, the, word, icon, referred, to, any, and, all, images, not, just, religious, ones, but, there, was, barely, a, need, for, a, separate, word, for, these, it, is, in, a, context, attributed, to, the, 5th, century, that, the, first, mention, of, an, image, of, mary, painted, from, life, appears, though, earlier, paintings, on, catacomb, walls, bear, resemblance, to, modern, icons, of, mary, theodorus, lector, in, his, 6th, century, history, of, the, church, 1, 1, stated, that, eudokia, wife, of, emperor, theodosius, ii, d, 460, sent, an, image, of, the, mother, of, god, named, icon, of, the, hodegetria, from, jerusalem, to, pulcheria, daughter, of, arcadius, the, former, emperor, and, father, of, theodosius, ii, the, image, was, specified, to, have, been, painted, by, the, apostle, luke, margherita, guarducci, relates, a, tradition, that, the, original, icon, of, mary, attributed, to, luke, sent, by, eudokia, to, pulcheria, from, palestine, was, a, large, circular, icon, only, of, her, head, when, the, icon, arrived, in, constantinople, it, was, fitted, in, as, the, head, into, a, very, large, rectangular, icon, of, her, holding, the, christ, child, and, it, is, this, composite, icon, that, became, the, one, historically, known, as, the, hodegetria, she, further, states, another, tradition, that, when, the, last, latin, emperor, of, constantinople, baldwin, ii, fled, constantinople, in, 1261, he, took, this, original, circular, portion, of, the, icon, with, him, this, remained, in, the, possession, of, the, angevin, dynasty, who, had, it, inserted, into, a, much, larger, image, of, mary, and, the, christ, child, which, is, presently, enshrined, above, the, high, altar, of, the, benedictine, abbey, church, of, montevergine, this, icon, was, subjected, to, repeated, repainting, over, the, subsequent, centuries, so, that, it, is, difficult, to, determine, what, the, original, image, of, mary, s, face, would, have, looked, like, guarducci, states, that, in, 1950, an, ancient, image, of, mary, at, the, church, of, santa, francesca, romana, was, determined, to, be, a, very, exact, but, reverse, mirror, image, of, the, original, circular, icon, that, was, made, in, the, 5th, century, and, brought, to, rome, where, it, has, remained, until, the, present, in, later, tradition, the, number, of, icons, of, mary, attributed, to, luke, greatly, multiplied, the, salus, populi, romani, the, theotokos, of, vladimir, the, theotokos, iverskaya, of, mount, athos, the, theotokos, of, tikhvin, the, theotokos, of, smolensk, and, the, black, madonna, of, cz, stochowa, are, examples, and, another, is, in, the, cathedral, on, st, thomas, mount, which, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, seven, painted, by, luke, the, evangelist, and, brought, to, india, by, thomas, the, apostle, ethiopia, has, at, least, seven, more, bissera, v, pentcheva, concludes, the, myth, was, invented, in, order, to, support, the, legitimacy, of, icon, veneration, during, the, iconoclastic, controversy, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, much, later, than, most, art, historians, put, it, according, to, reformed, baptist, pastor, john, carpenter, by, claiming, the, existence, of, a, portrait, of, the, theotokos, painted, during, her, lifetime, by, the, evangelist, luke, the, iconodules, fabricated, evidence, for, the, apostolic, origins, and, divine, approval, of, images, in, the, period, before, and, during, the, iconoclastic, controversy, stories, attributing, the, creation, of, icons, to, the, new, testament, period, greatly, increased, with, several, apostles, and, even, mary, herself, believed, to, have, acted, as, the, artist, or, commissioner, of, images, also, embroidered, in, the, case, of, mary, there, was, a, continuing, opposition, to, images, and, their, misuse, within, christianity, from, very, early, times, whenever, images, threatened, to, gain, undue, influence, within, the, church, theologians, have, sought, to, strip, them, of, their, power, further, there, is, no, century, between, the, fourth, and, the, eighth, in, which, there, is, not, some, evidence, of, opposition, to, images, even, within, the, church, nonetheless, popular, favor, for, icons, guaranteed, their, continued, existence, while, no, systematic, apologia, for, or, against, icons, or, doctrinal, authorization, or, condemnation, of, icons, yet, existed, the, use, of, icons, was, seriously, challenged, by, byzantine, imperial, authority, in, the, 8th, century, though, by, this, time, opposition, to, images, was, strongly, entrenched, in, judaism, and, islam, attribution, of, the, impetus, toward, an, iconoclastic, movement, in, eastern, orthodoxy, to, muslims, or, jews, seems, to, have, been, highly, exaggerated, both, by, contemporaries, and, by, modern, scholars, though, significant, in, the, history, of, religious, doctrine, the, byzantine, controversy, over, images, is, not, seen, as, of, primary, importance, in, byzantine, history, ew, historians, still, hold, it, to, have, been, the, greatest, issue, of, the, period, the, iconoclastic, period, began, when, images, were, banned, by, emperor, leo, iii, the, isaurian, sometime, between, 726, and, 730, under, his, son, constantine, v, a, council, forbidding, image, veneration, was, held, at, hieria, near, constantinople, in, 754, image, veneration, was, later, reinstated, by, the, empress, regent, irene, under, whom, another, council, was, held, reversing, the, decisions, of, the, previous, iconoclast, council, and, taking, its, title, as, seventh, ecumenical, council, the, council, anathemized, all, who, hold, to, iconoclasm, i, e, those, who, held, that, veneration, of, images, constitutes, idolatry, then, the, ban, was, enforced, again, by, leo, v, in, 815, finally, icon, veneration, was, decisively, restored, by, empress, regent, theodora, in, 843, at, the, council, of, constantinople, from, then, on, all, byzantine, coins, had, a, religious, image, or, symbol, on, the, reverse, usually, an, image, of, christ, for, larger, denominations, with, the, head, of, the, emperor, on, the, obverse, reinforcing, the, bond, of, the, state, and, the, divine, order, the, tradition, of, acheiropoieta, literally, not, made, by, hand, accrued, to, icons, that, are, alleged, to, have, come, into, existence, miraculously, not, by, a, human, painter, such, images, functioned, as, powerful, relics, as, well, as, icons, and, their, images, were, naturally, seen, as, authoritative, as, to, the, true, appearance, of, the, subject, naturally, and, especially, because, of, the, reluctance, to, accept, mere, human, productions, as, embodying, anything, of, the, divine, a, commonplace, of, christian, deprecation, of, man, made, idols, like, icons, believed, to, be, painted, directly, from, the, live, subject, they, therefore, acted, as, important, references, for, other, images, in, the, tradition, beside, the, developed, legend, of, the, mandylion, or, image, of, edessa, was, the, tale, of, the, veil, of, veronica, whose, very, name, signifies, true, icon, or, true, image, the, fear, of, a, false, image, remaining, strong, although, there, are, earlier, records, of, their, use, no, panel, icons, earlier, than, the, few, from, the, 6th, century, preserved, at, the, greek, orthodox, saint, catherine, s, monastery, in, egypt, survive, as, the, other, examples, in, rome, have, all, been, drastically, over, painted, the, surviving, evidence, for, the, earliest, depictions, of, christ, mary, and, saints, therefore, comes, from, wall, paintings, mosaics, and, some, carvings, they, are, realistic, in, appearance, in, contrast, to, the, later, stylization, they, are, broadly, similar, in, style, though, often, much, superior, in, quality, to, the, mummy, portraits, done, in, wax, encaustic, and, found, at, fayyum, in, egypt, as, can, be, judged, from, such, items, the, first, depictions, of, jesus, were, generic, rather, than, portrait, images, generally, representing, him, as, a, beardless, young, man, it, was, some, time, before, the, earliest, examples, of, the, long, haired, bearded, face, that, was, later, to, become, standardized, as, the, image, of, jesus, appeared, when, they, did, begin, to, appear, there, was, still, variation, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, said, that, no, one, knew, the, appearance, of, jesus, or, that, of, mary, however, augustine, was, not, a, resident, of, the, holy, land, and, therefore, was, not, familiar, with, the, local, populations, and, their, oral, traditions, gradually, paintings, of, jesus, took, on, characteristics, of, portrait, images, at, this, time, the, manner, of, depicting, jesus, was, not, yet, uniform, and, there, was, some, controversy, over, which, of, the, two, most, common, icons, was, to, be, favored, the, first, or, semitic, form, showed, jesus, with, short, and, frizzy, hair, the, second, showed, a, bearded, jesus, with, hair, parted, in, the, middle, the, manner, in, which, the, god, zeus, was, depicted, theodorus, lector, remarked, that, of, the, two, the, one, with, short, and, frizzy, hair, was, more, authentic, to, support, his, assertion, he, relates, a, story, excerpted, by, john, of, damascus, that, a, pagan, commissioned, to, paint, an, image, of, jesus, used, the, zeus, form, instead, of, the, semitic, form, and, that, as, punishment, his, hands, withered, though, their, development, was, gradual, it, is, possible, to, date, the, full, blown, appearance, and, general, ecclesiastical, as, opposed, to, simply, popular, or, local, acceptance, of, christian, images, as, venerated, and, miracle, working, objects, to, the, 6th, century, when, as, hans, belting, writes, we, first, hear, of, the, church, s, use, of, religious, images, as, we, reach, the, second, half, of, the, sixth, century, we, find, that, images, are, attracting, direct, veneration, and, some, of, them, are, credited, with, the, performance, of, miracles, cyril, mango, writes, in, the, post, justinianic, period, the, icon, assumes, an, ever, increasing, role, in, popular, devotion, and, there, is, a, proliferation, of, miracle, stories, connected, with, icons, some, of, them, rather, shocking, to, our, eyes, however, the, earlier, references, by, eusebius, and, irenaeus, indicate, veneration, of, images, and, reported, miracles, associated, with, them, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, in, the, icons, of, eastern, orthodoxy,

by, god, and, thus, the, doctrine, of, deification, is, conveyed, by, icons, letters, are, symbols, too, most, icons, incorporate, some, calligraphic, text, naming, the, person, or, event, depicted, even, this, is, often, presented, in, a, stylized, manner, the, historical, tradition, of, icons, used, for, purposes, other, than, visual, depiction, are, the, palladium, protective, image, the, palladium, classical, antiquity, the, acheiropoieta, and, various, folk, traditions, associated, with, folk, religion, of, these, various, forms, the, oldest, tradition, dates, back, to, before, the, christian, era, among, the, ancient, greeks, the, various, folk, traditions, are, more, poorly, documented, and, often, are, associated, with, local, folk, narratives, of, uncertain, origin, in, english, since, around, 1600, the, word, palladium, has, been, used, figuratively, to, mean, anything, believed, to, provide, protection, or, safety, and, in, particular, in, christian, contexts, a, sacred, relic, or, icon, believed, to, have, a, protective, role, in, military, contexts, for, a, whole, city, people, or, nation, such, beliefs, first, become, prominent, in, the, eastern, churches, in, the, period, after, the, reign, of, the, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, and, later, spread, to, the, western, church, palladia, were, processed, around, the, walls, of, besieged, cities, and, sometimes, carried, into, battle, the, eastern, orthodox, view, of, the, origin, of, icons, is, generally, quite, different, from, that, of, most, secular, scholars, and, from, some, in, contemporary, roman, catholic, circles, the, orthodox, church, maintains, and, teaches, that, the, sacred, image, has, existed, from, the, beginning, of, christianity, l, onid, ouspensky, has, written, accounts, that, some, non, orthodox, writers, consider, legendary, are, accepted, as, history, within, eastern, orthodoxy, because, they, are, a, part, of, church, tradition, thus, accounts, such, as, that, of, the, miraculous, image, not, made, by, hands, and, the, weeping, and, moving, mother, of, god, of, the, sign, of, novgorod, are, accepted, as, fact, church, tradition, tells, us, for, example, of, the, existence, of, an, icon, of, the, savior, during, his, lifetime, the, icon, made, without, hands, and, of, icons, of, the, most, holy, theotokos, immediately, after, him, eastern, orthodoxy, further, teaches, that, a, clear, understanding, of, the, importance, of, icons, was, part, of, the, church, from, its, very, beginning, and, has, never, changed, although, explanations, of, their, importance, may, have, developed, over, time, this, is, because, icon, painting, is, rooted, in, the, theology, of, the, incarnation, christ, being, the, eikon, of, god, which, did, not, change, though, its, subsequent, clarification, within, the, church, occurred, over, the, period, of, the, first, seven, ecumenical, councils, icons, also, served, as, tools, of, edification, for, the, illiterate, faithful, during, most, of, the, history, of, christendom, thus, icons, are, words, in, painting, they, refer, to, the, history, of, salvation, and, to, its, manifestation, in, concrete, persons, in, the, orthodox, church, icons, have, always, been, understood, as, a, visible, gospel, as, a, testimony, to, the, great, things, given, man, by, god, the, incarnate, logos, in, the, council, of, 860, it, was, stated, that, all, that, is, uttered, in, words, written, in, syllables, is, also, proclaimed, in, the, language, of, colors, eastern, orthodox, find, the, first, instance, of, an, image, or, icon, in, the, bible, when, god, made, man, in, his, own, image, septuagint, greek, eikona, in, genesis, 1, 26, 27, in, exodus, god, commanded, that, the, israelites, not, make, any, graven, image, soon, afterwards, however, he, commanded, that, they, make, graven, images, of, cherubim, and, other, like, things, both, as, statues, and, woven, on, tapestries, later, solomon, included, still, more, such, imagery, when, he, built, the, first, temple, eastern, orthodox, believe, these, qualify, as, icons, in, that, they, were, visible, images, depicting, heavenly, beings, and, in, the, case, of, the, cherubim, used, to, indirectly, indicate, god, s, presence, above, the, ark, in, the, book, of, numbers, it, is, written, that, god, told, moses, to, make, a, bronze, serpent, nehushtan, and, hold, it, up, so, that, anyone, looking, at, the, snake, would, be, healed, of, their, snake, bites, in, john, 3, jesus, refers, to, the, same, serpent, saying, that, he, must, be, lifted, up, in, the, same, way, that, the, serpent, was, john, of, damascus, also, regarded, the, brazen, serpent, as, an, icon, further, jesus, christ, himself, is, called, the, image, of, the, invisible, god, in, colossians, 1, 15, and, is, therefore, in, one, sense, an, icon, as, people, are, also, made, in, god, s, images, people, are, also, considered, to, be, living, icons, and, are, therefore, censed, along, with, painted, icons, during, orthodox, prayer, services, according, to, john, of, damascus, anyone, who, tries, to, destroy, icons, is, the, enemy, of, christ, the, holy, mother, of, god, and, the, saints, and, is, the, defender, of, the, devil, and, his, demons, this, is, because, the, theology, behind, icons, is, closely, tied, to, the, incarnational, theology, of, the, humanity, and, divinity, of, jesus, so, that, attacks, on, icons, typically, have, the, effect, of, undermining, or, attacking, the, incarnation, of, jesus, himself, as, elucidated, in, the, ecumenical, councils, basil, of, caesarea, in, his, writing, on, the, holy, spirit, says, the, honor, paid, to, the, image, passes, to, the, prototype, he, also, illustrates, the, concept, by, saying, if, i, point, to, a, statue, of, caesar, and, ask, you, who, is, that, your, answer, would, properly, be, it, is, caesar, when, you, say, such, you, do, not, mean, that, the, stone, itself, is, caesar, but, rather, the, name, and, honor, you, ascribe, to, the, statue, passes, over, to, the, original, the, archetype, caesar, himself, this, is, thus, the, approach, to, icons, to, kiss, an, icon, of, jesus, in, the, eastern, orthodox, view, is, to, show, love, towards, jesus, himself, not, mere, wood, and, paint, making, up, the, physical, substance, of, the, icon, worship, of, the, icon, as, somehow, entirely, separate, from, its, prototype, is, expressly, forbidden, by, the, seventh, ecumenical, council, icons, are, often, illuminated, with, a, candle, or, jar, of, oil, with, a, wick, beeswax, for, candles, and, olive, oil, for, oil, lamps, are, preferred, because, they, burn, very, cleanly, although, other, materials, are, sometimes, used, the, illumination, of, religious, images, with, lamps, or, candles, is, an, ancient, practice, pre, dating, christianity, according, to, fr, les, bundy, the, ecumenical, counciliar, dogmatic, decrees, on, icons, refer, in, fact, to, all, religious, images, including, three, dimensional, statues, professor, sergios, verkhovskoi, the, conservative, professor, of, dogmatics, at, st, vladimir, s, seminary, forthrightly, condemns, as, heretical, anyone, who, declares, statues, as, unorthodox, or, in, any, way, canonically, inferior, to, paintings, historically, the, orthodox, church, has, always, approved, of, veneration, of, statues, for, example, the, statue, of, the, mother, of, god, at, sokolica, monastery, in, serbia, the, devotional, statues, of, st, nil, stolbensky, and, those, of, st, paraskeva, of, the, icon, painting, tradition, that, developed, in, byzantium, with, constantinople, as, the, chief, city, we, have, only, a, few, icons, from, the, 11th, century, and, none, preceding, them, in, part, because, of, the, iconoclastic, reforms, during, which, many, were, destroyed, or, lost, and, also, because, of, plundering, by, the, republic, of, venice, in, 1204, during, the, fourth, crusade, and, finally, the, fall, of, constantinople, in, 1453, it, was, only, in, the, komnenian, period, 1081, 1185, that, the, cult, of, the, icon, became, widespread, in, the, byzantine, world, partly, on, account, of, the, dearth, of, richer, materials, such, as, mosaics, ivory, and, vitreous, enamels, but, also, because, an, iconostasis, a, special, screen, for, icons, was, introduced, then, in, ecclesiastical, practice, the, style, of, the, time, was, severe, hieratic, and, distant, in, the, late, comnenian, period, this, severity, softened, and, emotion, formerly, avoided, entered, icon, painting, major, monuments, for, this, change, include, the, murals, at, daphni, monastery, c, 1100, and, the, church, of, st, panteleimon, near, skopje, 1164, the, theotokos, of, vladimir, c, 1115, is, probably, the, most, representative, example, of, the, new, trend, towards, spirituality, and, emotion, the, tendency, toward, emotionalism, in, icons, continued, in, the, paleologan, period, which, began, in, 1261, palaiologan, art, reached, its, pinnacle, in, mosaics, such, as, those, of, chora, church, in, the, last, half, of, the, 14th, century, palaiologan, saints, were, painted, in, an, exaggerated, manner, very, slim, and, in, contorted, positions, a, style, known, as, the, palaiologan, mannerism, of, which, ochrid, s, annunciation, is, a, superb, example, after, 1453, the, byzantine, tradition, was, carried, on, in, regions, previously, influenced, by, its, religion, and, culture, in, the, balkans, russia, and, other, slavic, countries, georgia, and, armenia, in, the, caucasus, and, among, eastern, orthodox, minorities, in, the, islamic, world, in, the, greek, speaking, world, crete, ruled, by, venice, until, the, mid, 17th, century, was, an, important, centre, of, painted, icons, as, home, of, the, cretan, school, exporting, many, to, europe, crete, was, under, venetian, control, from, 1204, and, became, a, thriving, center, of, art,

venetian, territories, and, by, eastern, orthodox, for, ease, of, transport, cretan, painters, specialized, in, panel, paintings, and, developed, the, ability, to, work, in, many, styles, to, fit, the, taste, of, various, patrons, el, greco, who, moved, to, venice, after, establishing, his, reputation, in, crete, is, the, most, famous, artist, of, the, school, who, continued, to, use, many, byzantine, conventions, in, his, works, in, 1669, the, city, of, heraklion, on, crete, which, at, one, time, boasted, at, least, 120, painters, fell, to, the, turks, from, that, time, greek, icon, painting, went, into, a, decline, with, a, revival, attempted, in, the, 20th, century, by, art, reformers, such, as, photis, kontoglou, who, emphasized, a, return, to, earlier, styles, russian, icons, are, typically, paintings, on, wood, often, small, though, some, in, churches, and, monasteries, may, be, as, large, as, a, table, top, many, religious, homes, in, russia, have, icons, hanging, on,

constantinople, as, time, passed, the, russians, notably, andrei, rublev, and, dionisius, widened, the, vocabulary, of, iconic, types, and, styles, far, beyond, anything, found, elsewhere, the, personal, improvisatory, and, creative, traditions, of, western, european, religious, art, are, largely, lacking, in, russia, before, the, 17th, century, when, simon, ushakov, s, painting, became,

patriarch, nikon, of, moscow, resulted, in, a, split, in, the, russian, orthodox, church, the, traditionalists, the, persecuted, old, ritualists, or, old, believers, continued, the, traditional, stylization, of, icons, while, the, state, church, modified, its, practice, from, that, time, icons, began, to, be, painted, not, only, in, the, traditional, stylized, and, nonrealistic, mode, but, also, in, a, mixture, of, russian, stylization, and, western, european, realism, and, in, a, western, european, manner, very, much, like, that, of, catholic, religious, art, of, the, time, the, stroganov, school, and, the, icons, from, nevyansk, rank, among, the, last, important, schools, of, russian, icon, painting, in, romania, icons, painted, as, reversed, images, behind, glass, and, set, in, frames, were, common, in, the, 19th, century, and, are, still, made, the, process, is, known, as, reverse, glass, painting, in, the, transylvanian, countryside, the, expensive, icons, on, panels, imported, from, moldavia, wallachia, and, mt, athos, were, gradually, replaced, by, small, locally, produced, icons, on, glass, which, were, much, less, expensive, and, thus, accessible, to, the, transylvanian, peasants, the, earliest, historical, records, about, icons, in, serbia, dates, back, to, the, period, of, nemanji, dynasty, one, of, the, notable, schools, of, serb, icons, was, active, in, the, bay, of, kotor, from, the, 17th, century, to, the, 19th, century, trojeru, ica, meaning, three, handed, theotokos, is, the, most, important, icon, of, the, serbian, orthodox, church, and,

in, the, hellenistic, art, of, egyptian, late, antiquity, as, exemplified, by, the, fayum, mummy, portraits, beginning, in, the, 4th, century, churches, painted, their, walls, and, made, icons, to, reflect, an, authentic, expression, of, their, faith, the, aleppo, school, was, a, school, of, icon, painting, founded, by, the, priest, yusuf, al, musawwir, also, known, as, joseph, the, painter, and, active, in, aleppo, which, was, then, a, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, between, at, least, 1645, and, 1777, although, the, word, icon, is, not, generally, used, in, western, christianity, there, are, religious, works, of, art, which, were, largely, patterned, on, byzantine, works, and, equally, conventional, in, composition, and, depiction, until, the, 13th, century, icon, like, depictions, of, sacred, figures, followed, eastern, patterns, although, very, few, survive, from, this, early, period, italian, examples, are, in, a, style, known, as, italo, byzantine, from, the, 13th, century, the, western, tradition, came, slowly, to, allow, the, artist, far, more, flexibility, and, a, more, realist, approach, to, the, figures, if, only, because, there, was, a, much, smaller, number, of, skilled, artists, the, quantity, of, works, of, art, in, the, sense, of, panel, paintings, was, much, smaller, in, the, west, and, in, most, western, settings, a, single, diptych, as, an, altarpiece, or, in, a, domestic, room, probably, stood, in, place, of, the, larger, collections, typical, of, orthodox, icon, corners, only, in, the, 15th, century, did, production, of, painted, works, of, art, begin, to, approach, eastern, levels, supplemented, by, mass, produced, imports, from, the, cretan, school, in, this, century, the, use, of, icon, like, portraits, in, the, west, was, enormously, increased, by, the, introduction, of, old, master, prints, on, paper, mostly, woodcuts, which, were, produced, in, vast, numbers, although, hardly, any, survive, they, were, mostly, sold, hand, coloured, by, churches, and, the, smallest, sizes, often, only, an, inch, high, were, affordable, even, by, peasants, who, glued, or, pinned, them, straight, onto, a, wall, with, the, reformation, after, an, initial, uncertainty, among, early, lutherans, who, painted, a, few, icon, like, depictions, of, leading, reformers, and, continued, to, paint, scenes, from, scripture, protestants, came, down, firmly, against, icon, like, portraits, especially, larger, ones, even, of, christ, many, protestants, found, these, idolatrous, the, catholic, church, accepted, the, decrees, of, the, iconodule, seventh, ecumenical, council, regarding, images, there, is, some, minor, difference, however, in, the, catholic, attitude, to, images, from, that, of, the, orthodox, following, gregory, the, great, catholics, emphasize, the, role, of, images, as, the, biblia, pauperum, the, bible, of, the, poor, from, which, those, who, could, not, read, could, nonetheless, learn, catholics, also, however, share, the, same, viewpoint, with, the, orthodox, when, it, comes, to, image, veneration, believing, that, whenever, approached, sacred, images, are, to, be, shown, reverence, though, using, both, flat, wooden, panel, and, stretched, canvas, paintings, catholics, traditionally, have, also, favored, images, in, the, form, of, three, dimensional, statuary, whereas, in, the, east, statuary, is, much, less, widely, employed, a, joint, lutheran, orthodox, statement, made, in, the, 7th, plenary, of, the, lutheran, orthodox, joint, commission, in, july, 1993, in, helsinki, reaffirmed, the, ecumenical, council, decisions, on, the, nature, of, christ, and, the, veneration, of, images, 7, as, lutherans, and, orthodox, we, affirm, that, the, teachings, of, the, ecumenical, councils, are, authoritative, for, our, churches, the, ecumenical, councils, maintain, the, integrity, of, the, teaching, of, the, undivided, church, concerning, the, saving, illuminating, justifying, and, glorifying, acts, of, god, and, reject, heresies, which, subvert, the, saving, work, of, god, in, christ, orthodox, and, lutherans, however, have, different, histories, lutherans, have, received, the, nicaeno, constantinopolitan, creed, with, the, addition, of, the, filioque, the, seventh, ecumenical, council, the, second, council, of, nicaea, in, 787, which, rejected, iconoclasm, and, restored, the, veneration, of, icons, in, the, churches, was, not, part, of, the, tradition, received, by, the, reformation, lutherans, however, rejected, the, iconoclasm, of, the, 16th, century, and, affirmed, the, distinction, between, adoration, due, to, the, triune, god, alone, and, all, other, forms, of, veneration, ca, 21, through, historical, research, this, council, has, become, better, known, nevertheless, it, does, not, have, the, same, significance, for, lutherans, as, it, does, for, the, orthodox, yet, lutherans, and, orthodox, are, in, agreement, that, the, second, council, of, nicaea, confirms, the, christological, teaching, of, the, earlier, councils, and, in, setting, forth, the, role, of, images, icons, in, the, lives, of, the, faithful, reaffirms, the, reality, of, the, incarnation, of, the, eternal, word, of, god, when, it, states, the, more, frequently, christ, mary, the, mother, of, god, and, the, saints, are, seen, the, more, are, those, who, see, them, drawn, to, remember, and, long, for, those, who, serve, as, models, and, to, pay, these, icons, the, tribute, of, salutation, and, respectful, veneration, certainly, this, is, not, the, full, adoration, in, accordance, with, our, faith, which, is, properly, paid, only, to, the, divine, nature, but, it, resembles, that, given, to, the, figure, of, the, honored, and, life, giving, cross, and, also, to, the, holy, books, of, the, gospels, and, to, other, sacred, objects, definition, of, the, second, council, of, nicaea
