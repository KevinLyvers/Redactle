place, where, islamic, prayers, are, performed, such, as, an, outdoor, courtyard, originally, mosques, were, simple, places, of, prayer, for, the, early, muslims, and, may, have, been, open, spaces, rather, than, elaborate, buildings, in, the, first, stage, of, islamic, architecture, 650, 750, ce, early, mosques, comprised, open, and, closed, covered, spaces, enclosed, by, walls, often, with, minarets, from, which, the, islamic, call, to, prayer, was, issued, on, a, daily, basis, it, is, typical, of, mosque, buildings, to, have, a, special, ornamental, niche, a, mihrab, set, into, the,

public, sermons, khutbah, are, delivered, on, the, event, of, friday, prayer, was, in, earlier, times, characteristic, of, the, central, city, mosque, but, has, since, become, common, in, smaller, mosques, to, varying, degrees, mosque, buildings, are, designed, so, that, there, are, segregated, spaces, for, men, and, women, this, basic, pattern, of, organization, has, assumed, different, forms,

around, 621, ce, there, s, a, growing, realization, among, scholars, that, the, present, day, perception, of, mosques, doesn, t, fully, align, with, their, original, concept, early, islamic, texts, and, practices, highlight, mosques, as, vibrant, centers, integral, to, muslim, communities, supporting, religious, social, economic, and, political, affairs, during, and, after, the, early, muslim, conquests, mosques, were, established, outside, of, arabia, in, the, hundreds, many, synagogues, churches, and, temples, were, converted, into, mosques, and, thus, influenced, islamic, architectural, styles, over, the, centuries, while, most, pre, modern, mosques, were, funded, by, charitable, endowments, waqf, the, modern, day, trend, of, government, regulation, of, large, mosques, has, been, countered, by, the, rise, of, privately, funded, mosques, many, of, which, serve, as, bases, for, different, streams, of, islamic, revivalism, and, social, activism, the, word, mosque, entered, the, english, language, from, the, french, word, mosqu, e, probably, derived, from, italian, moschea, a, variant, of, italian, moscheta, from, either, middle, armenian, mzkit, medieval, greek, masg, dion, or, spanish, mezquita, from, meaning, site, of, prostration, in, prayer, and, hence, a, place, of, worship, either, from, nabataean, masg, dh, or, from, arabic, arabic, romanized, sajada, meaning, to,

the, first, structure, built, by, muhammad, upon, his, emigration, from, mecca, in, 622, ce, both, located, in, the, hejaz, region, in, present, day, saudi, arabia, other, scholars, reference, islamic, tradition, and, passages, of, the, quran, according, to, which, islam, as, a, religion, precedes, muhammad, and, includes, previous, prophets, such, as, abraham, in, islamic, tradition, abraham, is, credited, with, having, built, the, ka, bah, in, mecca, and, consequently, its, sanctuary, al, masjid, al, haram, which, is, seen, by, muslims, as, the, first, mosque, that, existed, a, hadith, in, sahih, al, bukhari, states, that, the, sanctuary, of, the, ka, bah, was, the, first, mosque, on, earth, with, the, second, mosque, being, al, aqsa, in, jerusalem, which, is, also, associated, with, abraham, since, as, early, as, 638, ce, the, sacred, mosque, of, mecca, has, been, expanded, on, several, occasions, to, accommodate, the, increasing, number, of, muslims, who, either, live, in, the, area, or, make, the, annual, pilgrimage, known, as, hajj, to, the, city, either, way, after, the, quba, mosque, muhammad, went, on, to, establish, another, mosque, in, medina, which, is, now, known, as, al, masjid, an, nabawi, the, prophet, s, mosque, built, on, the, site, of, his, home, muhammad, participated, in, the, construction, of, the, mosque, himself, and, helped, pioneer, the, concept, of, the, mosque, as, the, focal, point, of, the, islamic, city, the, prophet, s, mosque, is, considered, by, some, scholars, of, islamic, architecture, to, be, the, first, mosque, the, mosque, had, a, roof, supported, by, columns, made, of, palm, tree, trunks, and, it, included, a, large, courtyard, a, motif, common, among, mosques, built, since, then, rebuilt, and, expanded, over, time, it, soon, became, a, larger, hypostyle, structure, it, probably, served, as, a, model, for, the, construction, of, early, mosques, elsewhere, it, introduced, some, of, the, features, still, common, in, today, s, mosques, including, the, niche, at, the, front, of, the, prayer, space, known, as, the, mihrab, first, added, in, the, umayyad, period, and, the, tiered, pulpit, called, the, minbar, the, umayyad, caliphate, was, particularly, instrumental, in, spreading, islam, and, establishing, mosques, within, the, levant, as, the, umayyads, constructed, among, the, most, revered, mosques, in, the, region, al, aqsa, mosque, and, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, and, the, umayyad, mosque, in, damascus, the, designs, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, and, the, umayyad, mosque, were, influenced, by, byzantine, architecture, a, trend, that, continued, much, later, with, the, rise, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, in, present, day, tunisia, was, the, first, mosque, built, in, the, maghreb, northwest, africa, with, its, present, form, dating, from, the, ninth, century, serving, as, a, model, for, other, islamic, places, of, worship, in, the, maghreb, it, was, the, first, in, the, region, to, incorporate, a, square, minaret, which, was, characteristic, of, later, maghrebi, mosques, and, includes, naves, akin, to, a, basilica, those, features, can, also, be, found, in, andalusi, mosques, including, the, great, mosque, of, cordoba, as, they, tended, to, reflect, the, architecture, of, the, moors, instead, of, their, visigoth, predecessors, still, some, elements, of, visigothic, architecture, like, horseshoe, arches, were, infused, into, the, mosque, architecture, of, spain, and, the, maghreb, muslim, empires, were, instrumental, in, the, evolution, and, spread, of, mosques, although, mosques, were, first, established, in, india, during, the, seventh, century, they, were, not, commonplace, across, the, subcontinent, until, the, arrival, of, the, mughals, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, reflecting, their, timurid, origins, mughal, style, mosques, included, onion, domes, pointed, arches, and, elaborate, circular, minarets, features, common, in, the, persian, and, central, asian, styles, the, jama, masjid, in, delhi, and, the, badshahi, mosque, in, lahore, built, in, a, similar, manner, in, the, mid, 17th, century, remain, two, of, the, largest, mosques, on, the, indian, subcontinent, the, first, mosque, in, east, asia, was, established, in, the, eighth, century, in, xi, an, the, great, mosque, of, xi, an, whose, current, building, dates, from, the, 18th, century, does, not, replicate, the, features, often, associated, with, mosques, elsewhere, minarets, were, initially, prohibited, by, the, state, following, traditional, chinese, architecture, the, great, mosque, of, xi, an, like, many, other, mosques, in, eastern, china, resembles, a, pagoda, with, a, green, roof, instead, of, the, yellow, roof, common, on, imperial, structures, in, china, mosques, in, western, china, were, more, likely, to, incorporate, elements, like, domes, and, minarets, traditionally, seen, in, mosques, elsewhere, a, similar, integration, of, foreign, and, local, influences, could, be, seen, on, the, indonesian, islands, of, sumatra, and, java, where, mosques, including, the, demak, great, mosque, were, first, established, in, the, 15th, century, early, javanese, mosques, took, design, cues, from, hindu, buddhist, and, chinese, architectural, influences, with, tall, timber, multi, level, roofs, similar, to, the, pagodas, of, balinese, hindu, temples, the, ubiquitous, islamic, dome, did, not, appear, in, indonesia, until, the, 19th, century, in, turn, the, javanese, style, influenced, the, styles, of, mosques, in, indonesia, s, austronesian, neighbors, malaysia, brunei, and, the, philippines, several, of, the, early, mosques, in, the, ottoman, empire, were, originally, churches, or, cathedrals, from, the, byzantine, empire, with, the, hagia, sophia, one, of, those, converted, cathedrals, informing, the, architecture, of, mosques, from, after, the, ottoman, conquest, of, constantinople, the, ottomans, developed, their, own, architectural, style, characterized, by, large, central, domes, sometimes, surrounded, by, multiple, smaller, domes, pencil, shaped, minarets, and, open, fa, ades, mosques, from, the, ottoman, period, are, still, scattered, across, eastern, europe, but, the, most, rapid, growth, in, the, number, of, mosques, in, europe, has, occurred, within, the, past, century, as, more, muslims, have, migrated, to, the, continent, many, major, european, cities, are, home, to, mosques, like, the, grand, mosque, of, paris, that, incorporate, domes, minarets, and, other, features, often, found, with, mosques, in, muslim, majority, countries, the, first, mosque, in, north, america, was, founded, by, albanian, americans, in, 1915, but, the, continent, s, oldest, surviving, mosque, the, mother, mosque, of, america, was, built, in, 1934, as, in, europe, the, number, of, american, mosques, has, rapidly, increased, in, recent, decades, as, muslim, immigrants, particularly, from, south, asia, have, come, in, the, united, states, greater, than, forty, percent, of, mosques, in, the, united, states, were, constructed, after, 2000, according, to, early, muslim, historians, towns, that, surrendered, without, resistance, and, made, treaties, with, the, muslims, were, allowed, to, retain, their, churches, and, the, towns, captured, by, muslims, had, many, of, their, churches, converted, to, mosques, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, these, kinds, of, conversions, was, in, damascus, syria, where, in, 705, umayyad, caliph, al, walid, i, bought, the, church, of, st, john, from, the, christians, and, had, it, rebuilt, as, a, mosque, in, exchange, for, building, a, number, of, new, churches, for, the, christians, in, damascus, overall, abd, al, malik, ibn, marwan, al, waleed, s, father, is, said, to, have, transformed, 10, churches, in, damascus, into, mosques, the, process, of, turning, churches, into, mosques, were, especially, intensive, in, the, villages, where, most, of, the, inhabitants, converted, to, islam, the, abbasid, caliph, al, ma, mun, turned, many, churches, into, mosques, ottoman, turks, converted, nearly, all, churches, monasteries, and, chapels, in, constantinople, including, the, famous, hagia, sophia, into, mosques, immediately, after, capturing, the, city, in, 1453, in, some, instances, mosques, have, been, established, on, the, places, of, jewish, or, christian, sanctuaries, associated, with, biblical, personalities, who, were, also, recognized, by, islam, mosques, have, also, been, converted, for, use, by, other, religions, notably, in, southern, spain, following, the, conquest, of, the, moors, in, 1492, the, most, prominent, of, them, is, the, great, mosque, of, cordoba, itself, constructed, on, the, site, of, a, church, demolished, during, the, period, of, muslim, rule, outside, of, the, iberian, peninsula, such, instances, also, occurred, in, southeastern, europe,

gender, or, age, arab, plan, or, hypostyle, mosques, are, the, earliest, type, of, mosques, pioneered, under, the, umayyad, dynasty, these, mosques, have, square, or, rectangular, plans, with, an, enclosed, courtyard, sahn, and, covered, prayer, hall, historically, in, the, warm, middle, eastern, and, mediterranean, climates, the, courtyard, served, to, accommodate, the, large, number, of, worshippers, during, friday, prayers, most, early, hypostyle, mosques, had, flat, roofs, on, prayer, halls, which, required, the, use, of, numerous, columns, and, supports, one, of, the, most, notable, hypostyle, mosques, is, the, great, mosque, of, cordoba, in, spain, the, building, being, supported, by, over, 850, columns, frequently, hypostyle, mosques, have, outer, arcades, riwaq, so, that, visitors, can, enjoy, the, shade, arab, plan, mosques, were, constructed, mostly, under, the, umayyad, and, abbasid, dynasties, the, simplicity, of, the, arab, plan, limited, the, opportunities, for, further, development, the, mosques, consequently, losing, popularity, the, first, departure, within, mosque, design, started, in, persia, iran, the, persians, had, inherited, a, rich, architectural, legacy, from, the, earlier, persian, dynasties, and, they, began, incorporating, elements, from, earlier, parthian, and, sassanid, designs, into, their, mosques, influenced, by, buildings, such, as, the, palace, of, ardashir, and, the, sarvestan, palace, thus, islamic, architecture, witnessed, the, introduction, of, such, structures, as, domes, and, large, arched, entrances, referred, to, as, iwans, during, seljuq, rule, as, islamic, mysticism, was, on, the, rise, the, four, iwan, arrangement, took, form, the, four, iwan, format, finalized, by, the, seljuqs, and, later, inherited, by, the, safavids, firmly, established, the, courtyard, fa, ade, of, such, mosques, with, the, towering, gateways, at, every, side, as, more, important, than, the, actual, buildings, themselves, they, typically, took, the, form, of, a, square, shaped, central, courtyard, with, large, entrances, at, each, side, giving, the, impression, of, gateways, to, the, spiritual, world, the, persians, also, introduced, persian, gardens, into, mosque, designs, soon, a, distinctly, persian, style, of, mosques, started, appearing, that, would, significantly, influence, the, designs, of, later, timurid, and, also, mughal, mosque, designs, the, ottomans, introduced, central, dome, mosques, in, the, 15th, century, these, mosques, have, a, large, dome, centered, over, the, prayer, hall, in, addition, to, having, a, large, central, dome, a, common, feature, is, smaller, domes, that, exist, off, center, over, the, prayer, hall, or, throughout, the, rest, of, the, mosque, where, prayer, is, not, performed, this, style, was, heavily, influenced, by, byzantine, architecture, with, its, use, of, large, central, domes, islam, forbids, figurative, art, on, the, grounds, that, the, artist, must, not, imitate, god, s, creation, mosques, are, therefore, decorated, with, abstract, patterns, and, beautiful, inscriptions, decoration, is, often, concentrated, around, doorways, and, the, mi, r, b, tiles, are, used, widely, in, mosques, they, lend, themselves, to, pattern, making, can, be, made, with, beautiful, subtle, colors, and, can, create, a, cool, atmosphere, an, advantage, in, the, hot, arab, countries, quotations, from, the, quran, often, adorn, mosque, interiors, these, texts, are, meant, to, inspire, people, by, their, beauty, while, also, reminding, them, of, the, words, of, allah, the, prayer, hall, also, known, as, the, mu, all, arabic, rarely, has, furniture, chairs, and, pews, are, generally, absent, from, the, prayer, hall, so, as, to, allow, as, many, worshipers, as, possible, to, line, the, room, some, mosques, have, islamic, calligraphy, and, quranic, verses, on, the, walls, to, create, a, more, religious, atmosphere, for, worshippers, often, a, limited, part, of, the, prayer, hall, is, sanctified, formally, as, a, masjid, in, the, shar, ah, sense, although, the, term, masjid, is, also, used, for, the, larger, mosque, complex, as, well, once, designated, there, are, onerous, limitations, on, the, use, of, this, formally, designated, masjid, and, it, may, not, be, used, for, any, purpose, other, than, worship, restrictions, that, do, not, necessarily, apply, to, the, rest, of, the, prayer, area, and, to, the, rest, of, the, mosque, complex, although, such, uses, may, be, restricted, by, the, conditions, of, the, waqf, that, owns, the, mosque, in, many, mosques, especially, the, early, congregational, mosques, the, prayer, hall, is, built, in, the, hypostyle, form, the, roof, held, up, by, a, multitude, of, columns, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, the, hypostyle, plan, mosques, is, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, in, tunisia, usually, opposite, the, entrance, to, the, prayer, hall, is, the, qibla, wall, the, direction, of, mecca, and, thus, the, direction, towards, which, muslims, should, face, for, prayer, the, visually, emphasized, area, inside, the, prayer, hall, the, qibla, wall, should, in, a, properly, oriented, mosque, be, set, perpendicular, to, a, line, leading, to, mecca, where, the, kaaba, is, located, congregants, pray, in, rows, parallel, to, the, qiblah, wall, and, thus, arrange, themselves, so, they, face, mecca, in, the, qibla, wall, usually, at, its, center, is, the, mi, r, b, a, niche, or, depression, indicating, the, direction, of, mecca, usually, the, mihrab, is, not, occupied, by, furniture, either, a, raised, minbar, pulpit, is, located, to, the, right, side, of, the, mihrab, for, a, kha, b, preacher, or, some, other, speaker, to, offer, a, khu, bah, sermon, during, the, ritual, friday, prayers, the, mihrab, serves, as, the, location, where, the, imam, or, mullah, leads, the, five, daily, prayers, on, a, regular, basis, left, to, the, mihrab, in, the, front, left, corner, of, the, mosque, sometimes, there, is, a, kursu, turkish, k, rs, bosnian, urs, a, small, elevated, plateau, rarely, with, a, chair, or, other, type, of, seat, used, for, less, formal, preaching, and, speeches, women, who, pray, in, mosques, are, separated, from, men, their, part, for, prayer, is, called, maqfil, bosnian, makfil, it, is, located, above, the, main, prayer, hall, elevated, in, the, background, as, stairs, separated, gallery, or, plateau, surface, shortened, to, the, back, relative, to, the, bottom, main, part, it, usually, has, a, perforated, fence, at, the, front, through, which, the, imam, or, mullah, and, the, other, male, worshippers, in, the, main, hall, can, be, partially, seen, a, mi, r, b, also, spelled, as, mehrab, is, a, semicircular, niche, in, the, wall, of, a, mosque, that, faces, the, qiblah, i, e, the, front, of, the, mosque, the, imam, stands, in, this, niche, and, leads, prayer, given, that, the, imam, typically, stands, alone, in, the, frontmost, row, this, niche, s, practical, effect, is, to, save, unused, space, the, minbar, is, a, pulpit, from, which, the, friday, sermon, is, delivered, while, the, minbar, of, muhammad, was, a, simple, chair, later, it, became, larger, and, attracted, artistic, attention, some, remained, made, of, wood, albeit, exquisitely, carved, while, others, were, made, of, marble, and, featured, friezes, a, common, feature, in, mosques, is, the, minaret, the, tall, slender, tower, that, usually, is, situated, at, one, of, the, corners, of, the, mosque, structure, the, top, of, the, minaret, is, always, the, highest, point, in, mosques, that, have, one, and, often, the, highest, point, in, the, immediate, area, the, origin, of, the, minaret, and, its, initial, functions, are, not, clearly, known, and, have, long, been, a, topic, of, scholarly, discussion, the, earliest, mosques, lacked, minarets, and, the, call, to, prayer, was, often, performed, from, smaller, structures, or, elevated, platforms, the, early, muslim, community, of, medina, gave, the, call, to, prayer, from, the, doorway, or, the, roof, of, the, house, of, muhammad, which, doubled, as, a, place, for, prayer, the, first, confirmed, minarets, in, the, form, of, towers, date, from, the, early, 9th, century, under, abbasid, rule, and, they, did, not, become, a, standard, feature, of, mosques, until, the, 11th, century, these, first, minaret, towers, were, placed, in, the, middle, of, the, wall, opposite, the, qibla, wall, among, them, the, minaret, of, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, in, tunisia, dating, from, 836, is, well, preserved, and, is, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, minarets, in, the, world, today, before, the, five, required, daily, prayers, a, mu, adhdhin, arabic, calls, the, worshippers, to, prayer, from, the, minaret, in, many, countries, like, singapore, where, muslims, are, not, the, majority, mosques, are, prohibited, from, loudly, broadcasting, the, adh, n, arabic, call, to, prayer, although, it, is, supposed, to, be, said, loudly, to, the, surrounding, community, the, adhan, is, required, before, every, prayer, nearly, every, mosque, assigns, a, muezzin, for, each, prayer, to, say, the, adhan, as, it, is, a, recommended, practice, or, sunnah, arabic, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, at, mosques, that, do, not, have, minarets, the, adhan, is, called, instead, from, inside, the, mosque, or, somewhere, else, on, the, ground, the, iq, mah, arabic, which, is, similar, to, the, adhan, and, proclaimed, right, before, the, commencement, of, prayers, is, usually, not, proclaimed, from, the, minaret, even, if, a, mosque, has, one, the, domes, often, placed, directly, above, the, main, prayer, hall, may, signify, the, vaults, of, the, heaven, and, sky, as, time, progressed, domes, grew, from, occupying, a, small, part, of, the, roof, near, the, mihrab, to, encompassing, the, whole, roof, above, the, prayer, hall, although, domes, normally, took, on, the, shape, of, a, hemisphere, the, mughals, in, india, popularized, onion, shaped, domes, in, south, asia, which, has, gone, on, to, become, characteristic, of, the, arabic, architectural, style, of, dome, some, mosques, have, multiple, often, smaller, domes, in, addition, to, the, main, large, dome, that, resides, at, the, center, the, domes, of, turkish, style, mosques, are, influenced, by, byzantine, architecture, particularly, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, as, the, balkans, and, constantinople, became, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, as, ritual, purification, precedes, all, prayers, mosques, often, have, ablution, fountains, or, other, facilities, for, washing, in, their, entryways, or, courtyards, worshippers, at, much, smaller, mosques, often, have, to, use, restrooms, to, perform, their, ablutions, in, traditional, mosques, this, function, is, often, elaborated, into, a, freestanding, building, in, the, center, of, a, courtyard, this, desire, for, cleanliness, extends, to, the, prayer, halls, where, shoes, are, disallowed, to, be, worn, anywhere, other, than, the, cloakroom, thus, foyers, with, shelves, to, put, shoes, and, racks, to, hold, coats, are, commonplace, among, mosques, modern, mosques, have, a, variety, of, amenities, available, to, their, congregants, as, mosques, are, supposed, to, appeal, to, the, community, they, may, also, have, additional, facilities, from, health, clinics, and, clubs, gyms, to, libraries, to, gymnasiums, to, serve, the, community, certain, symbols, are, represented, in, a, mosque, s, architecture, to, allude, to, different, aspects, of, the, islamic, religion, one, of, these, feature, symbols, is, the, spiral, the, cosmic, spiral, found, in, designs, and, on, minarets, is, a, references, to, heaven, as, it, has, no, beginning, and, no, end, mosques, also, often, have, floral, patterns, or, images, of, fruit, and, vegetables, these, are, allusions, to, the, paradise, after, death, appointment, of, a, prayer, leader, is, considered, desirable, but, not, always, obligatory, the, permanent, prayer, leader, imam, must, be, a, free, honest, individual, and, is, authoritative, in, religious, matters, in, mosques, constructed, and, maintained, by, the, government, the, prayer, leader, is, appointed, by, the, ruler, in, private, mosques, appointment, is, made, by, members, of, the, congregation, through, majority, voting, according, to, the, hanafi, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, the, individual, who, built, the, mosque, has, a, stronger, claim, to, the, title, of, imam, but, this, view, is, not, shared, by, the, other, schools, leadership, at, prayer, falls, into, three, categories, depending, on, the, type, of, prayer, five, daily, prayers, friday, prayer, or, optional, prayers, according, to, the, hanafi, and, maliki, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, appointment, of, a, prayer, leader, for, friday, service, is, mandatory, because, otherwise, the, prayer, is, invalid, the, shafi, i, and, hanbali, schools, argue, that, the, appointment, is, not, necessary, and, the, prayer, is, valid, as, long, as, it, is, performed, in, a, congregation, a, slave, may, lead, a, friday, prayer, but, muslim, authorities, disagree, over, whether, the, job, can, be, done, by, a, minor, an, imam, appointed, to, lead, friday, prayers, may, also, lead, at, the, five, daily, prayers, muslim, scholars, agree, to, the, leader, appointed, for, five, daily, services, may, lead, the, friday, service, as, well, all, muslim, authorities, hold, the, consensus, opinion, that, only, men, may, lead, prayer, for, men, nevertheless, women, prayer, leaders, are, allowed, to, lead, prayer, in, front, of, all, female, congregations, all, mosques, have, rules, regarding, cleanliness, as, it, is, an, essential, part, of, the, worshippers, experience, muslims, before, prayer, are, required, to, cleanse, themselves, in, an, ablution, process, known, as, wudu, shoes, must, not, be, worn, inside, the, carpeted, prayer, hall, some, mosques, will, also, extend, that, rule, to, include, other, parts, of, the, facility, even, if, those, other, locations, are, not, devoted, to, prayer, congregants, and, visitors, to, mosques, are, supposed, to, be, clean, themselves, it, is, also, undesirable, to, come, to, the, mosque, after, eating, something, that, smells, such, as, garlic, islam, requires, that, its, adherents, wear, clothes, that, portray, modesty, men, are, supposed, to, come, to, the, mosque, wearing, loose, and, clean, clothes, that, do, not, reveal, the, shape, of, the, body, likewise, it, is, recommended, that, women, at, a, mosque, wear, loose, clothing, that, covers, to, the, wrists, and, ankles, and, cover, their, heads, with, a, ij, b, arabic, or, other, covering, many, muslims, regardless, of, their, ethnic, background, wear, middle, eastern, clothing, associated, with, arabic, islam, to, special, occasions, and, prayers, at, mosques, as, mosques, are, places, of, worship, those, within, the, mosque, are, required, to, remain, respectful, to, those, in, prayer, loud, talking, within, the, mosque, as, well, as, discussion, of, topics, deemed, disrespectful, is, forbidden, in, areas, where, people, are, praying, in, addition, it, is, disrespectful, to, walk, in, front, of, or, otherwise, disturb, muslims, in, prayer, the, walls, within, the, mosque, have, few, items, except, for, possibly, islamic, calligraphy, so, muslims, in, prayer, are, not, distracted, muslims, are, also, discouraged, from, wearing, clothing, with, distracting, images, and, symbols, so, as, not, to, divert, the, attention, of, those, standing, behind, them, during, prayer, in, many, mosques, even, the, carpeted, prayer, area, has, no, designs, its, plainness, helping, worshippers, to, focus, there, is, nothing, written, in, the, qur, an, about, the, issue, of, space, in, mosques, and, gender, separation, traditional, rules, have, segregated, women, and, men, by, traditional, rules, women, are, most, often, told, to, occupy, the, rows, behind, the, men, in, part, this, was, a, practical, matter, as, the, traditional, posture, for, prayer, kneeling, on, the, floor, head, to, the, ground, made, mixed, gender, prayer, uncomfortably, revealing, for, many, women, and, distracting, for, some, men, traditionalists, try, to, argue, that, muhammad, preferred, women, to, pray, at, home, rather, than, at, a, mosque, and, they, cite, a, ad, th, in, which, muhammad, supposedly, said, the, best, mosques, for, women, are, the, inner, parts, of, their, houses, although, women, were, active, participants, in, the, mosque, started, by, muhammad, muhammad, told, muslims, not, to, forbid, women, from, entering, mosques, they, are, allowed, to, go, in, the, second, sunni, caliph, umar, at, one, time, prohibited, women, from, attending, mosques, especially, at, night, because, he, feared, they, might, be, sexually, harassed, or, assaulted, by, men, so, he, required, them, to, pray, at, home, sometimes, a, special, part, of, the, mosque, was, railed, off, for, women, for, example, the, governor, of, mecca, in, 870, had, ropes, tied, between, the, columns, to, make, a, separate, place, for, women, many, mosques, today, will, put, the, women, behind, a, barrier, or, partition, or, in, another, room, mosques, in, south, and, southeast, asia, put, men, and, women, in, separate, rooms, as, the, divisions, were, built, into, them, centuries, ago, in, nearly, two, thirds, of, american, mosques, women, pray, behind, partitions, or, in, separate, areas, not, in, the, main, prayer, hall, some, mosques, do, not, admit, women, at, all, due, to, the, lack, of, space, and, the, fact, that, some, prayers, such, as, the, friday, jumu, ah, are, mandatory, for, men, but, optional, for, women, although, there, are, sections, exclusively, for, women, and, children, the, grand, mosque, in, mecca, is, desegregated, under, most, interpretations, of, sharia, non, muslims, are, permitted, to, enter, mosques, provided, that, they, respect, the, place, and, the, people, inside, it, a, dissenting, opinion, and, minority, view, is, presented, by, followers, of, the, maliki, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, who, argue, that, non, muslims, may, not, be, allowed, into, mosques, under, any, circumstances, the, quran, addresses, the, subject, of, non, muslims, and, particularly, polytheists, in, mosques, in, two, verses, in, its, ninth, chapter, sura, at, tawba, the, seventeenth, verse, of, the, chapter, prohibits, those, who, join, gods, with, allah, polytheists, from, maintaining, mosques, it, is, not, for, the, polytheists, to, maintain, the, mosques, of, allah, while, they, openly, profess, disbelief, their, deeds, are, void, and, they, will, be, in, the, fire, forever, the, twenty, eighth, verse, of, the, same, chapter, is, more, specific, as, it, only, considers, polytheists, in, the, masjid, al, haram, in, mecca, o, believers, indeed, the, polytheists, are, spiritually, impure, so, they, should, not, approach, the, sacred, mosque, after, this, year, if, you, fear, poverty, allah, will, enrich, you, out, of, his, bounty, if, he, wills, surely, allah, is, all, knowing, all, wise, according, to, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, these, verses, were, followed, to, the, letter, at, the, times, of, muhammad, when, jews, and, christians, considered, monotheists, were, still, allowed, to, al, masjid, al, haram, the, umayyad, caliph, umar, ii, later, forbade, non, muslims, from, entering, mosques, and, his, ruling, remains, in, practice, in, present, day, saudi, arabia, today, the, decision, on, whether, non, muslims, should, be, allowed, to, enter, mosques, varies, with, few, exceptions, mosques, in, the, arabian, peninsula, as, well, as, morocco, do, not, allow, entry, to, non, muslims, for, example, the, hassan, ii, mosque, in, casablanca, is, one, of, only, two, mosques, in, morocco, currently, open, to, non, muslims, there, are, many, other, mosques, in, the, west, and, islamic, world, which, non, muslims, are, welcome, to, enter, most, mosques, in, the, united, states, for, example, report, receiving, non, muslim, visitors, every, month, many, mosques, throughout, the, united, states, welcome, non, muslims, as, a, sign, of, openness, to, the, rest, of, the, community, as, well, as, to, encourage, conversions, to, islam, in, modern, day, saudi, arabia, the, grand, mosque, and, all, of, mecca, are, open, only, to, muslims, likewise, al, masjid, al, nabawi, and, the, city, of, medina, that, surrounds, it, are, also, off, limits, to, those, who, do, not, practice, islam, for, mosques, in, other, areas, it, has, most, commonly, been, taken, that, non, muslims, may, only, enter, mosques, if, granted, permission, to, do, so, by, muslims, and, if, they, have, a, legitimate, reason, all, entrants, regardless, of, religious, affiliation, are, expected, to, respect, the, rules, and, decorum, for, mosques, in, modern, turkey, non, muslim, tourists, are, allowed, to, enter, any, mosque, but, there, are, some, strict, rules, visiting, a, mosque, is, allowed, only, between, prayers, visitors, are, required, to, wear, long, trousers, and, not, to, wear, shoes, women, must, cover, their, heads, visitors, are, not, allowed, to, interrupt, praying, muslims, especially, by, taking, photos, of, them, no, loud, talk, is, allowed, and, no, references, to, other, religions, are, allowed, no, crosses, on, necklaces, no, cross, gestures, etc, similar, rules, apply, to, mosques, in, malaysia, where, larger, mosques, that, are, also, tourist, attractions, such, as, the, masjid, negara, provide, robes, and, headscarves, for, visitors, who, are, deemed, inappropriately, attired, in, certain, times, and, places, non, muslims, were, expected, to, behave, a, certain, way, in, the, vicinity, of, a, mosque, in, some, moroccan, cities, jews, were, required, to, remove, their, shoes, when, passing, by, a, mosque, in, 18th, century, egypt, jews, and, christians, had, to, dismount, before, several, mosques, in, veneration, of, their, sanctity, the, association, of, the, mosque, with, education, remained, one, of, its, main, characteristics, throughout, history, and, the, school, became, an, indispensable, appendage, to, the, mosque, from, the, earliest, days, of, islam, the, mosque, was, the, center, of, the, muslim, community, a, place, for, prayer, meditation, religious, instruction, political, discussion, and, a, school, anywhere, islam, took, hold, mosques, were, established, and, basic, religious, and, educational, instruction, began, the, late, 20th, century, saw, an, increase, in, the, number, of, mosques, used, for, political, purposes, while, some, governments, in, the, muslim, world, have, attempted, to, limit, the, content, of, friday, sermons, to, strictly, religious, topics, there, are, also, independent, preachers, who, deliver, khutbas, that, address, social, and, political, issues, often, in, emotionally, charged, terms, common, themes, include, social, inequalities, necessity, of, jihad, in, the, face, of, injustice, and, the, universal, struggle, between, good, and, evil, in, islamic, countries, like, bangladesh, pakistan, iran, and, saudi, arabia, political, subjects, are, preached, by, imams, at, friday, congregations, on, a, regular, basis, mosques, often, serve, as, meeting, points, for, political, opposition, in, times, of, crisis, countries, with, a, minority, muslim, population, are, more, likely, than, muslim, majority, countries, of, the, greater, middle, east, to, use, mosques, as, a, way, to, promote, civic, participation, studies, of, us, muslims, have, consistently, shown, a, positive, correlation, between, mosque, attendance, and, political, involvement, some, of, the, research, connects, civic, engagement, specifically, with, mosque, attendance, for, social, and, religious, activities, other, than, prayer, american, mosques, host, voter, registration, and, civic, participation, drives, that, promote, involving, muslims, who, are, often, first, or, second, generation, immigrants, in, the, political, process, as, a, result, of, these, efforts, as, well, as, attempts, at, mosques, to, keep, muslims, informed, about, the, issues, facing, the, muslim, community, regular, mosque, attendants, are, more, likely, to, participate, in, protests, sign, petitions, and, otherwise, be, involved, in, politics, research, on, muslim, civic, engagement, in, other, western, countries, is, less, conclusive, but, seems, to, indicate, similar, trends, as, they, are, considered, important, to, the, muslim, community, mosques, like, other, places, of, worship, can, be, at, the, heart, of, social, conflicts, the, babri, mosque, in, india, was, the, subject, of, such, a, conflict, up, until, the, early, 1990s, when, it, was, demolished, before, a, mutual, solution, could, be, devised, the, mosque, was, destroyed, on, december, 6, 1992, as, the, mosque, was, built, by, babur, allegedly, on, the, site, of, a, previous, hindu, temple, marking, the, birthplace, of, rama, the, controversy, surrounded, the, mosque, was, directly, linked, to, rioting, in, bombay, present, day, mumbai, as, well, as, bombings, in, 1993, that, killed, 257, people, bombings, in, february, 2006, and, june, 2007, seriously, damaged, iraq, s, al, askari, mosque, and, exacerbated, existing, tensions, other, mosque, bombings, in, iraq, both, before, and, after, the, february, 2006, bombing, have, been, part, of, the, conflict, between, the, country, s, groups, of, muslims, in, june, 2005, a, suicide, bombing, killed, at, least, 19, people, at, an, afghan, shia, mosque, near, jade, maivand, in, april, 2006, two, explosions, occurred, at, india, s, jama, masjid, following, the, al, askari, mosque, bombing, in, iraq, imams, and, other, islamic, leaders, used, mosques, and, friday, prayers, as, vehicles, to, call, for, calm, and, peace, in, the, midst, of, widespread, violence, a, study, 2005, indicated, that, while, support, for, suicide, bombings, is, not, correlated, with, personal, devotion, to, islam, among, palestinian, muslims, it, is, correlated, with, mosque, attendance, because, participating, in, communal, religious, rituals, of, any, kind, likely, encourages, support, for, self, sacrificing, behaviors, that, are, done, for, the, collective, good, following, the, september, 11, attacks, several, american, mosques, were, targeted, in, attacks, ranging, from, simple, vandalism, to, arson, furthermore, the, jewish, defense, league, was, suspected, of, plotting, to, bomb, the, king, fahd, mosque, in, culver, city, california, similar, attacks, occurred, throughout, the, united, kingdom, following, the, 7, july, 2005, london, bombings, outside, the, western, world, in, june, 2001, the, hassan, bek, mosque, was, the, target, of, vandalism, and, attacks, by, hundreds, of, israelis, after, a, suicide, bomber, killed, 19, people, in, a, night, club, in, tel, aviv, although, mosquegoing, is, highly, encouraged, for, men, it, is, permitted, to, stay, at, home, when, one, feels, at, risk, from, islamophobic, persecution, although, the, saudi, involvement, in, sunni, mosques, around, the, world, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 1960s, it, was, not, until, later, in, the, 20th, century, that, the, government, of, saudi, arabia, became, a, large, influence, in, foreign, sunni, mosques, beginning, in, the, 1980s, the, saudi, arabian, government, began, to, finance, the, construction, of, sunni, mosques, in, countries, around, the, world, an, estimated, us, 45, billion, has, been, spent, by, the, saudi, arabian, government, financing, mosques, and, sunni, islamic, schools, in, foreign, countries, ain, al, yaqeen, a, saudi, newspaper, reported, in, 2002, that, saudi, funds, may, have, contributed, to, building, as, many, as, 1, 500, mosques, and, 2, 000, other, islamic, centers, saudi, citizens, have, also, contributed, significantly, to, mosques, in, the, islamic, world, especially, in, countries, where, they, see, muslims, as, poor, and, oppressed, following, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1992, mosques, in, war, torn, afghanistan, saw, many, contributions, from, saudi, citizens, the, king, fahd, mosque, in, culver, city, california, and, the, islamic, cultural, center, of, italy, in, rome, represent, two, of, saudi, arabia, s, largest, investments, in, foreign, mosques, as, former, saudi, king, fahd, bin, abdul, aziz, al, saud, contributed, us, 8, million, and, us, 50, million, to, the, two, mosques,

looking, to, build, them, there, has, been, government, and, police, surveillance, of, mosques, in, the, us, and, local, attempts, to, ban, mosques, and, block, constructions, despite, data, showing, that, in, fact, most, americans, oppose, banning, the, building, of, mosques, 79, and, the, surveillance, of, u, s, mosques, 63, as, shown, in, a, 2018, study, done, by, the, institute, for, social, policy, and, understanding, since, 2017, chinese, authorities, have, destroyed, or, damaged, two, thirds, of, the, mosques, in, china, s, xinjiang, province, ningxia, officials, were, notified, on, 3,
