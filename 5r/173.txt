syncretism, s, k, r, t, z, m, s, n, is, the, practice, of, combining, different, beliefs, and, various, schools, of, thought, syncretism, involves, the, merging, or, assimilation, of, several, originally, discrete, traditions, especially, in, the, theology, and, mythology, of, religion, thus, asserting, an, underlying, unity, and, allowing, for, an, inclusive, approach, to, other, faiths, while, syncretism, in, art, and, culture, is, sometimes, likened, to, eclecticism, in, the, realm, of, religion, it, specifically, denotes, a, more, integrated, merging, of, beliefs, into, a, unified, system, distinct, from, eclecticism, which, implies, a, selective, adoption, of, elements, from, different, traditions, without, necessarily, blending, them, into, a, new, cohesive, belief, system, syncretism, also, manifests, in, politics, known, as, syncretic, politics, the, english, word, is, first, attested, in, the, early, 17th, century, it, is, from, modern, latin, syncretismus, drawing, on, the, ancient, greek, romanized, synkretismos, supposedly, meaning, cretan, federation, however, this, is, a, spurious, etymology, from, the, naive, idea, in, plutarch, s, 1st, century, ad, essay, on, fraternal, love, peri, philadelphias, in, his, collection, moralia, he, cites, the, example, of, the, cretans, who, compromised, and, reconciled, their, differences, and, came, together, in, alliance, when, faced, with, external, dangers, and, that, is, their, so, called, syncretism, more, likely, as, an, etymology, is, sun, with, plus, kerannumi, mix, and, its, related, noun, krasis, mixture, overt, syncretism, in, folk, belief, may, show, cultural, acceptance, of, an, alien, or, previous, tradition, but, the, other, cult, may, survive, or, infiltrate, without, authorized, syncresis, for, example, some, conversos, developed, a, sort, of, cult, for, martyr, victims, of, the, spanish, inquisition, thus, incorporating, elements, of, catholicism, while, resisting, it, the, kushite, kings, who, ruled, upper, egypt, for, approximately, a, century, and, the, whole, of, egypt, for, approximately, 57, years, from, 721, to, 664, bce, constituting, the, twenty, fifth, dynasty, in, manetho, s, aegyptiaca, developed, a, syncretic, worship, identifying, their, own, god, dedun, with, the, egyptian, osiris, they, maintained, that, worship, even, after, they, had, been, driven, out, of, egypt, a, temple, dedicated, to, this, syncretic, god, built, by, the, kushite, ruler, atlanersa, was, unearthed, at, jebel, barkal, syncretism, was, common, during, the, hellenistic, period, with, rulers, regularly, identifying, local, deities, in, various, parts, of, their, domains, with, the, relevant, god, or, goddess, of, the, greek, pantheon, as, a, means, of, increasing, the, cohesion, of, their, kingdom, this, practice, was, accepted, in, most, locations, but, vehemently, rejected, by, the, jews, who, considered, the, identification, of, yahweh, with, the, greek, zeus, as, the, worst, of, blasphemy, the, roman, empire, continued, the, practice, first, by, the, identification, of, traditional, roman, deities, with, greek, ones, producing, a, single, greco, roman, pantheon, and, then, identifying, members, of, that, pantheon, with, the, local, deities, of, various, roman, provinces, some, religious, movements, have, embraced, overt, syncretism, such, as, the, case, of, melding, shint, beliefs, into, buddhism, or, the, amalgamation, of, germanic, and, celtic, pagan, views, into, christianity, during, its, spread, into, gaul, ireland, britain, germany, and, scandinavia, in, later, times, christian, missionaries, in, north, america, identified, manitou, the, spiritual, and, fundamental, life, force, in, the, traditional, beliefs, of, the, algonquian, groups, with, the, god, of, christianity, similar, identifications, were, made, by, missionaries, at, other, locations, in, the, americas, and, africa, who, encountered, a, local, belief, in, a, supreme, god, or, supreme, spirit, of, some, kind, indian, influences, are, seen, in, the, practice, of, shi, i, islam, in, trinidad, others, have, strongly, rejected, it, as, devaluing, and, compromising, precious, and, genuine, distinctions, examples, include, post, exile, second, temple, judaism, islam, and, most, of, protestant, christianity, syncretism, tends, to, facilitate, coexistence, and, unity, between, otherwise, different, cultures, and, world, views, intercultural, competence, a, factor, that, has, recommended, it, to, rulers, of, multiethnic, realms, conversely, the, rejection, of, syncretism, usually, in, the, name, of, piety, and, orthodoxy, may, help, to, generate, bolster, or, authenticate, a, sense, of, uncompromised, cultural, unity, in, a, well, defined, minority, or, majority, all, major, religious, conversions, of, populations, have, had, elements, from, prior, religious, traditions, incorporated, into, legends, or, doctrine, that, endure, with, the, newly, converted, laity, religious, syncretism, is, the, blending, of, two, or, more, religious, belief, systems, into, a, new, system, or, the, incorporation, into, a, religious, tradition, of, beliefs, from, unrelated, traditions, this, can, occur, for, many, reasons, and, the, latter, scenario, happens, quite, commonly, in, areas, where, multiple, religious, traditions, exist, in, proximity, and, function, actively, in, a, culture, or, when, a, culture, is, conquered, and, the, conquerors, bring, their, religious, beliefs, with, them, but, do, not, succeed, in, entirely, eradicating, the, old, beliefs, or, especially, practices, religions, may, have, syncretic, elements, to, their, beliefs, or, history, but, adherents, of, so, labeled, systems, often, frown, on, applying, the, label, especially, adherents, who, belong, to, revealed, religious, systems, such, as, the, abrahamic, religions, or, any, system, that, exhibits, an, exclusivist, approach, such, adherents, sometimes, see, syncretism, as, a, betrayal, of, their, pure, truth, by, this, reasoning, adding, an, incompatible, belief, corrupts, the, original, religion, rendering, it, no, longer, true, indeed, critics, of, a, syncretistic, trend, may, use, the, word, or, its, variants, as, a, disparaging, epithet, as, a, charge, implying, that, those, who, seek, to, incorporate, a, new, view, belief, or, practice, into, a, religious, system, pervert, the, original, faith, non, exclusivist, systems, of, belief, on, the, other, hand, may, feel, quite, free, to, incorporate, other, traditions, into, their, own, keith, ferdinando, notes, that, the, term, syncretism, is, an, elusive, one, and, can, refer, to, substitution, or, modification, of, the, central, elements, of, a, religion, by, beliefs, or, practices, introduced, from, elsewhere, the, consequence, under, such, a, definition, according, to, ferdinando, can, lead, to, a, fatal, compromise, of, the, original, religion, s, integrity, in, modern, secular, society, religious, innovators, sometimes, construct, new, faiths, or, key, tenets, syncretically, with, the, added, benefit, or, aim, of, reducing, inter, religious, discord, such, chapters, often, have, a, side, effect, of, arousing, jealousy, and, suspicion, among, authorities, and, ardent, adherents, of, the, pre, existing, religion, such, religions, tend, to, inherently, appeal, to, an, inclusive, diverse, audience, sometimes, the, state, itself, sponsored, such, new, movements, such, as, the, living, church, founded, in, soviet, russia, and, the, german, evangelical, church, in, nazi, germany, chiefly, to, stem, all, outside, influences, according, to, some, authors, syncretism, is, often, used, to, describe, the, product, of, the, large, scale, imposition, of, one, alien, culture, religion, or, body, of, practices, over, another, that, is, already, present, others, such, as, jerry, h, bentley, however, have, argued, that, syncretism, has, also, helped, to, create, cultural, compromise, it, provides, an, opportunity, to, bring, beliefs, values, and, customs, from, one, cultural, tradition, into, contact, with, and, to, engage, different, cultural, traditions, such, a, migration, of, ideas, is, generally, successful, only, when, there, is, a, resonance, between, both, traditions, while, as, bentley, has, argued, there, are, numerous, cases, where, expansive, traditions, have, won, popular, support, in, foreign, lands, this, is, not, always, so, in, the, 16th, century, the, mughal, emperor, akbar, proposed, a, new, religion, called, the, din, i, ilahi, divine, faith, sources, disagree, with, respect, to, whether, it, was, one, of, many, sufi, orders, or, merged, some, of, the, elements, of, the, various, religions, of, his, empire, din, i, ilahi, drew, elements, primarily, from, islam, and, hinduism, but, also, from, christianity, jainism, and, zoroastrianism, more, resembling, a, personality, cult, than, a, religion, it, had, no, sacred, scriptures, no, priestly, hierarchy, and, fewer, than, 20, disciples, all, hand, picked, by, akbar, himself, it, is, also, accepted, that, the, policy, of, sulh, i, kul, which, formed, the, essence, of, the, d, n, i, il, h, was, adopted, by, akbar, as, a, part, of, general, imperial, administrative, policy, sulh, i, kul, means, universal, peace, the, syncretic, deism, of, matthew, tindal, undermined, christianity, s, claim, to, uniqueness, the, modern, rational, non, pejorative, connotations, of, syncretism, arguably, date, from, denis, diderot,

approaches, of, subjecting, all, claims, to, critical, thinking, prompted, at, this, time, much, literature, in, europe, and, the, americas, studying, non, european, religions, such, as, edward, moor, s, the, hindu, pantheon, of, 1810, much, of, which, was, almost, evangelistically, appreciative, by, embracing, spirituality, and, creating, the, space, and, tolerance, in, particular, disestablishment, of, religion, or, its, stronger, form, official, secularisation, as, in, france, whereby, believers, of, spiritualism, agnosticism, atheists, and, in, many, cases, more, innovative, or, pre, abrahimic, based, religions, could, promote, and, spread, their, belief, system, whether, in, the, family, or, beyond
