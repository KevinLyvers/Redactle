reportedly, haunted, locations, pseudoscience, consists, of, statements, beliefs, or, practices, that, claim, to, be, both, scientific, and, factual, but, are, incompatible, with, the, scientific, method, pseudoscience, is, often, characterized, by, contradictory, exaggerated, or, unfalsifiable, claims, reliance, on, confirmation, bias, rather, than, rigorous, attempts, at, refutation, lack, of, openness, to, evaluation, by, other, experts, absence, of, systematic, practices, when, developing, hypotheses, and, continued, adherence, long, after, the, pseudoscientific, hypotheses, have, been, experimentally, discredited, it, is, not, the, same, as, junk, science, the, demarcation, between, science, and, pseudoscience, has, scientific, philosophical, and, political, implications, philosophers, debate, the, nature, of, science, and, the, general, criteria, for, drawing, the, line, between, scientific, theories, and, pseudoscientific, beliefs, but, there, is, widespread, agreement, that, creationism, astrology, homeopathy, kirlian, photography, dowsing, ufology, ancient, astronaut, theory, holocaust, denialism, velikovskian, catastrophism, and, climate, change, denialism, are, pseudosciences, there, are, implications, for, health, care, the, use, of, expert, testimony, and, weighing, environmental, policies, recent, empirical, research, has, shown, that, individuals, who, indulge, in, pseudoscientific, beliefs, generally, show, lower, evidential, criteria, meaning, they, often, require, significantly, less, evidence, before, coming, to, conclusions, this, can, be, coined, as, a, jump, to, conclusions, bias, that, can, increase, the, spread, of, pseudoscientific, beliefs, addressing, pseudoscience, is, part, of, science, education, and, developing, scientific, literacy, pseudoscience, can, have, dangerous, effects, for, example, pseudoscientific, anti, vaccine, activism, and, promotion, of, homeopathic, remedies, as, alternative, disease, treatments, can, result, in, people, forgoing, important, medical, treatments, with, demonstrable, health, benefits, leading, to, deaths, and, ill, health, furthermore, people, who, refuse, legitimate, medical, treatments, for, contagious, diseases, may, put, others, at, risk, pseudoscientific, theories, about, racial, and, ethnic, classifications, have, led, to, racism, and, genocide, the, term, pseudoscience, is, often, considered, pejorative, particularly, by, its, purveyors, because, it, suggests, something, is, being, presented, as, science, inaccurately, or, even, deceptively, therefore, practitioners, and, advocates, of, pseudoscience, frequently, dispute, the, characterization, the, word, pseudoscience, is, derived, from, the, greek, root, pseudo, meaning, false, and, the, english, word, science, from, the, latin, word, scientia, meaning, knowledge, although, the, term, has, been, in, use, since, at, least, the, late, 18th, century, e, g, in, 1796, by, james, pettit, andrews, in, reference, to, alchemy, the, concept, of, pseudoscience, as, distinct, from, real, or, proper, science, seems, to, have, become, more, widespread, during, the, mid, 19th, century, among, the, earliest, uses, of, pseudo, science, was, in, an, 1844, article, in, the, northern, journal, of, medicine, issue, 387, that, opposite, kind, of, innovation, which, pronounces, what, has, been, recognized, as, a, branch, of, science, to, have, been, a, pseudo, science, composed, merely, of, so, called, facts, connected, together, by, misapprehensions, under, the, disguise, of, principles, an, earlier, use, of, the, term, was, in, 1843, by, the, french, physiologist, fran, ois, magendie, that, refers, to, phrenology, as, a, pseudo, science, of, the, present, day, during, the, 20th, century, the, word, was, used, pejoratively, to, describe, explanations, of, phenomena, which, were, claimed, to, be, scientific, but, which, were, not, in, fact, supported, by, reliable, experimental, evidence, from, time, to, time, however, the, usage, of, the, word, occurred, in, a, more, formal, technical, manner, in, response, to, a, perceived, threat, to, individual, and, institutional, security, in, a, social, and, cultural, setting, pseudoscience, is, differentiated, from, science, because, although, it, usually, claims, to, be, science, pseudoscience, does, not, adhere, to, scientific, standards, such, as, the, scientific, method, falsifiability, of, claims, and, mertonian, norms, a, number, of, basic, principles, are, accepted, by, scientists, as, standards, for, determining, whether, a, body, of, knowledge, method, or, practice, is, scientific, experimental, results, should, be, reproducible, and, verified, by, other, researchers, these, principles, are, intended, to, ensure, experiments, can, be, reproduced, measurably, given, the, same, conditions, allowing, further, investigation, to, determine, whether, a, hypothesis, or, theory, related, to, given, phenomena, is, valid, and, reliable, standards, require, the, scientific, method, to, be, applied, throughout, and, bias, to, be, controlled, for, or, eliminated, through, randomization, fair, sampling, procedures, blinding, of, studies, and, other, methods, all, gathered, data, including, the, experimental, or, environmental, conditions, are, expected, to, be, documented, for, scrutiny, and, made, available, for, peer, review, allowing, further, experiments, or, studies, to, be, conducted, to, confirm, or, falsify, results, statistical, quantification, of, significance, confidence, and, error, are, also, important, tools, for, the, scientific, method, during, the, mid, 20th, century, the, philosopher, karl, popper, emphasized, the, criterion, of, falsifiability, to, distinguish, science, from, non, science, statements, hypotheses, or, theories, have, falsifiability, or, refutability, if, there, is, the, inherent, possibility, that, they, can, be, proven, false, that, is, if, it, is, possible, to, conceive, of, an, observation, or, an, argument, that, negates, them, popper, used, astrology, and, psychoanalysis, as, examples, of, pseudoscience, and, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, as, an, example, of, science, he, subdivided, non, science, into, philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious, and, metaphysical, formulations, on, one, hand, and, pseudoscientific, formulations, on, the, other, another, example, which, shows, the, distinct, need, for, a, claim, to, be, falsifiable, was, stated, in, carl, sagan, s, publication, the, demon, haunted, world, when, he, discusses, an, invisible, dragon, that, he, has, in, his, garage, the, point, is, made, that, there, is, no, physical, test, to, refute, the, claim, of, the, presence, of, this, dragon, whatever, test, one, thinks, can, be, devised, there, is, a, reason, why, it, does, not, apply, to, the, invisible, dragon, so, one, can, never, prove, that, the, initial, claim, is, wrong, sagan, concludes, now, what, s, the, difference, between, an, invisible, incorporeal, floating, dragon, who, spits, heatless, fire, and, no, dragon, at, all, he, states, that, your, inability, to, invalidate, my, hypothesis, is, not, at, all, the, same, thing, as, proving, it, true, once, again, explaining, that, even, if, such, a, claim, were, true, it, would, be, outside, the, realm, of, scientific, inquiry, during, 1942, robert, k, merton, identified, a, set, of, five, norms, which, characterize, real, science, if, any, of, the, norms, were, violated, merton, considered, the, enterprise, to, be, non, science, his, norms, were, in, 1978, paul, thagard, proposed, that, pseudoscience, is, primarily, distinguishable, from, science, when, it, is, less, progressive, than, alternative, theories, over, a, long, period, of, time, and, its, proponents, fail, to, acknowledge, or, address, problems, with, the, theory, in, 1983, mario, bunge, suggested, the, categories, of, belief, fields, and, research, fields, to, help, distinguish, between, pseudoscience, and, science, where, the, former, is, primarily, personal, and, subjective, and, the, latter, involves, a, certain, systematic, method, the, 2018, book, about, scientific, skepticism, by, steven, novella, et, al, the, skeptics, guide, to, the, universe, lists, hostility, to, criticism, as, one, of, the, major, features, of, pseudoscience, larry, laudan, has, suggested, pseudoscience, has, no, scientific, meaning, and, is, mostly, used, to, describe, human, emotions, if, we, would, stand, up, and, be, counted, on, the, side, of, reason, we, ought, to, drop, terms, like, pseudo, science, and, unscientific, from, our, vocabulary, they, are, just, hollow, phrases, which, do, only, emotive, work, for, us, likewise, richard, mcnally, states, the, term, pseudoscience, has, become, little, more, than, an, inflammatory, buzzword, for, quickly, dismissing, one, s, opponents, in, media, sound, bites, and, when, therapeutic, entrepreneurs, make, claims, on, behalf, of, their, interventions, we, should, not, waste, our, time, trying, to, determine, whether, their, interventions, qualify, as, pseudoscientific, rather, we, should, ask, them, how, do, you, know, that, your, intervention, works, what, is, your, evidence, for, philosophers, silvio, funtowicz, and, jerome, r, ravetz, pseudo, science, may, be, defined, as, one, where, the, uncertainty, of, its, inputs, must, be, suppressed, lest, they, render, its, outputs, totally, indeterminate, the, definition, in, the, book, uncertainty, and, quality, in, science, for, policy, alludes, to, the, loss, of, craft, skills, in, handling, quantitative, information, and, to, the, bad, practice, of, achieving, precision, in, prediction, inference, only, at, the, expenses, of, ignoring, uncertainty, in, the, input, which, was, used, to, formulate, the, prediction, this, use, of, the, term, is, common, among, practitioners, of, post, normal, science, understood, in, this, way, pseudoscience, can, be, fought, using, good, practices, to, assess, uncertainty, in, quantitative, information, such, as, nusap, and, in, the, case, of, mathematical, modelling, sensitivity, auditing, the, history, of, pseudoscience, is, the, study, of, pseudoscientific, theories, over, time, a, pseudoscience, is, a, set, of, ideas, that, presents, itself, as, science, while, it, does, not, meet, the, criteria, to, be, properly, called, such, distinguishing, between, proper, science, and, pseudoscience, is, sometimes, difficult, one, proposal, for, demarcation, between, the, two, is, the, falsification, criterion, attributed, most, notably, to, the, philosopher, karl, popper, in, the, history, of, science, and, the, history, of, pseudoscience, it, can, be, especially, difficult, to, separate, the, two, because, some, sciences, developed, from, pseudosciences, an, example, of, this, transformation, is, the, science, of, chemistry, which, traces, its, origins, to, the, pseudoscientific, or, pre, scientific, study, of, alchemy, the, vast, diversity, in, pseudosciences, further, complicates, the, history, of, science, some, modern, pseudosciences, such, as, astrology, and, acupuncture, originated, before, the, scientific, era, others, developed, as, part, of, an, ideology, such, as, lysenkoism, or, as, a, response, to, perceived, threats, to, an, ideology, examples, of, this, ideological, process, are, creation, science, and, intelligent, design, which, were, developed, in, response, to, the, scientific, theory, of, evolution, a, topic, practice, or, body, of, knowledge, might, reasonably, be, termed, pseudoscientific, when, it, is, presented, as, consistent, with, the, norms, of, scientific, research, but, it, demonstrably, fails, to, meet, these, norms, the, ministry, of, ayush, in, the, government, of, india, is, purposed, with, developing, education, research, and, propagation, of, indigenous, alternative, medicine, systems, in, india, the, ministry, has, faced, significant, criticism, for, funding, systems, that, lack, biological, plausibility, and, are, either, untested, or, conclusively, proven, as, ineffective, quality, of, research, has, been, poor, and, drugs, have, been, launched, without, any, rigorous, pharmacological, studies, and, meaningful, clinical, trials, on, ayurveda, or, other, alternative, healthcare, systems, there, is, no, credible, efficacy, or, scientific, basis, of, any, of, these, forms, of, treatment, in, his, book, the, demon, haunted, world, carl, sagan, discusses, the, government, of, china, and, the, chinese, communist, party, s, concern, about, western, pseudoscience, developments, and, certain, ancient, chinese, practices, in, china, he, sees, pseudoscience, occurring, in, the, united, states, as, part, of, a, worldwide, trend, and, suggests, its, causes, dangers, diagnosis, and, treatment, may, be, universal, a, large, percentage, of, the, united, states, population, lacks, scientific, literacy, not, adequately, understanding, scientific, principles, and, method, in, the, journal, of, college, science, teaching, art, hobson, writes, pseudoscientific, beliefs, are, surprisingly, widespread, in, our, culture, even, among, public, school, science, teachers, and, newspaper, editors, and, are, closely, related, to, scientific, illiteracy, however, a, 10, 000, student, study, in, the, same, journal, concluded, there, was, no, strong, correlation, between, science, knowledge, and, belief, in, pseudoscience, during, 2006, the, u, s, national, science, foundation, nsf, issued, an, executive, summary, of, a, paper, on, science, and, engineering, which, briefly, discussed, the, prevalence, of, pseudoscience, in, modern, times, it, said, belief, in, pseudoscience, is, widespread, and, referencing, a, gallup, poll, stated, that, belief, in, the, 10, commonly, believed, examples, of, paranormal, phenomena, listed, in, the, poll, were, pseudoscientific, beliefs, the, items, were, extrasensory, perception, esp, that, houses, can, be, haunted, ghosts, telepathy, clairvoyance, astrology, that, people, can, mentally, communicate, with, the, dead, witches, reincarnation, and, channelling, such, beliefs, in, pseudoscience, represent, a, lack, of, knowledge, of, how, science, works, the, scientific, community, may, attempt, to, communicate, information, about, science, out, of, concern, for, the, public, s, susceptibility, to, unproven, claims, the, nsf, stated, that, pseudoscientific, beliefs, in, the, u, s, became, more, widespread, during, the, 1990s, peaked, about, 2001, and, then, decreased, slightly, since, with, pseudoscientific, beliefs, remaining, common, according, to, the, nsf, report, there, is, a, lack, of, knowledge, of, pseudoscientific, issues, in, society, and, pseudoscientific, practices, are, commonly, followed, surveys, indicate, about, a, third, of, adult, americans, consider, astrology, to, be, scientific, in, russia, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, significant, budgetary, funds, were, spent, on, programs, for, the, experimental, study, of, torsion, fields, the, extraction, of, energy, from, granite, the, study, of, cold, nuclear, fusion, and, astrological, and, extrasensory, research, by, the, ministry, of, defense, the, ministry, of, emergency, situations, the, ministry, of, internal, affairs, and, the, state, duma, see, military, unit, 10003, in, 2006, deputy, chairman, of, the, security, council, of, the, russian, federation, nikolai, spassky, published, an, article, in, rossiyskaya, gazeta, where, among, the, priority, areas, for, the, development, of, the, russian, energy, sector, the, task, of, extracting, energy, from, a, vacuum, was, in, the, first, place, the, clean, water, project, was, adopted, as, a, united, russia, party, project, in, the, version, submitted, to, the, government, the, program, budget, for, 2010, 2017, exceeded, 14, billion, there, have, been, many, connections, between, pseudoscientific, writers, and, researchers, and, their, anti, semitic, racist, and, neo, nazi, backgrounds, they, often, use, pseudoscience, to, reinforce, their, beliefs, one, of, the, most, predominant, pseudoscientific, writers, is, frank, collin, a, self, proclaimed, nazi, who, goes, by, frank, joseph, in, his, writings, the, majority, of, his, works, include, the, topics, of, atlantis, extraterrestrial, encounters, and, lemuria, as, well, as, other, ancient, civilizations, often, with, white, supremacist, undertones, for, example, he, posited, that, european, peoples, migrated, to, north, america, before, columbus, and, that, all, native, american, civilizations, were, initiated, by, descendants, of, white, people, the, alt, right, using, pseudoscience, to, base, their, ideologies, on, is, not, a, new, issue, the, entire, foundation, of, anti, semitism, is, based, on, pseudoscience, or, scientific, racism, in, an, article, from, newsweek, by, sander, gilman, gilman, describes, the, pseudoscience, community, s, anti, semitic, views, jews, as, they, appear, in, this, world, of, pseudoscience, are, an, invented, group, of, ill, stupid, or, stupidly, smart, people, who, use, science, to, their, own, nefarious, ends, other, groups, too, are, painted, similarly, in, race, science, as, it, used, to, call, itself, african, americans, the, irish, the, chinese, and, well, any, and, all, groups, that, you, want, to, prove, inferior, to, yourself, neo, nazis, and, white, supremacist, often, try, to, support, their, claims, with, studies, that, prove, that, their, claims, are, more, than, just, harmful, stereotypes, for, example, bret, stephens, published, a, column, in, the, new, york, times, where, he, claimed, that, ashkenazi, jews, had, the, highest, iq, among, any, ethnic, group, however, the, scientific, methodology, and, conclusions, reached, by, the, article, stephens, cited, has, been, called, into, question, repeatedly, since, its, publication, it, has, been, found, that, at, least, one, of, that, study, s, authors, has, been, identified, by, the, southern, poverty, law, center, as, a, white, nationalist, the, journal, nature, has, published, a, number, of, editorials, in, the, last, few, years, warning, researchers, about, extremists, looking, to, abuse, their, work, particularly, population, geneticists, and, those, working, with, ancient, dna, one, article, in, nature, titled, racism, in, science, the, taint, that, lingers, notes, that, early, twentieth, century, eugenic, pseudoscience, has, been, used, to, influence, public, policy, such, as, the, immigration, act, of, 1924, in, the, united, states, which, sought, to, prevent, immigration, from, asia, and, parts, of, europe, in, a, 1981, report, singer, and, benassi, wrote, that, pseudoscientific, beliefs, have, their, origin, from, at, least, four, sources, a, 1990, study, by, eve, and, dunn, supported, the, findings, of, singer, and, benassi, and, found, pseudoscientific, belief, being, promoted, by, high, school, life, science, and, biology, teachers, the, psychology, of, pseudoscience, attempts, to, explore, and, analyze, pseudoscientific, thinking, by, means, of, thorough, clarification, on, making, the, distinction, of, what, is, considered, scientific, vs, pseudoscientific, the, human, proclivity, for, seeking, confirmation, rather, than, refutation, confirmation, bias, the, tendency, to, hold, comforting, beliefs, and, the, tendency, to, overgeneralize, have, been, proposed, as, reasons, for, pseudoscientific, thinking, according, to, beyerstein, humans, are, prone, to, associations, based, on, resemblances, only, and, often, prone, to, misattribution, in, cause, effect, thinking, michael, shermer, s, theory, of, belief, dependent, realism, is, driven, by, the, belief, that, the, brain, is, essentially, a, belief, engine, which, scans, data, perceived, by, the, senses, and, looks, for, patterns, and, meaning, there, is, also, the, tendency, for, the, brain, to, create, cognitive, biases, as, a, result, of, inferences, and, assumptions, made, without, logic, and, based, on, instinct, usually, resulting, in, patterns, in, cognition, these, tendencies, of, patternicity, and, agenticity, are, also, driven, by, a, meta, bias, called, the, bias, blind, spot, or, the, tendency, to, recognize, the, power, of, cognitive, biases, in, other, people, but, to, be, blind, to, their, influence, on, our, own, beliefs, lindeman, states, that, social, motives, i, e, to, comprehend, self, and, the, world, to, have, a, sense, of, control, over, outcomes, to, belong, to, find, the, world, benevolent, and, to, maintain, one, s, self, esteem, are, often, more, easily, fulfilled, by, pseudoscience, than, by, scientific, information, furthermore, pseudoscientific, explanations, are, generally, not, analyzed, rationally, but, instead, experientially, operating, within, a, different, set, of, rules, compared, to, rational, thinking, experiential, thinking, regards, an, explanation, as, valid, if, the, explanation, is, personally, functional, satisfying, and, sufficient, offering, a, description, of, the, world, that, may, be, more, personal, than, can, be, provided, by, science, and, reducing, the, amount, of, potential, work, involved, in, understanding, complex, events, and, outcomes, anyone, searching, for, psychological, help, that, is, based, in, science, should, seek, a, licensed, therapist, whose, techniques, are, not, based, in, pseudoscience, hupp, and, santa, maria, provide, a, complete, explanation, of, what, that, person, should, look, for, there, is, a, trend, to, believe, in, pseudoscience, more, than, scientific, evidence, some, people, believe, the, prevalence, of, pseudoscientific, beliefs, is, due, to, widespread, scientific, illiteracy, individuals, lacking, scientific, literacy, are, more, susceptible, to, wishful, thinking, since, they, are, likely, to, turn, to, immediate, gratification, powered, by, system, 1, our, default, operating, system, which, requires, little, to, no, effort, this, system, encourages, one, to, accept, the, conclusions, they, believe, and, reject, the, ones, they, do, not, further, analysis, of, complex, pseudoscientific, phenomena, require, system, 2, which, follows, rules, compares, objects, along, multiple, dimensions, and, weighs, options, these, two, systems, have, several, other, differences, which, are, further, discussed, in, the, dual, process, theory, the, scientific, and, secular, systems, of, morality, and, meaning, are, generally, unsatisfying, to, most, people, humans, are, by, nature, a, forward, minded, species, pursuing, greater, avenues, of, happiness, and, satisfaction, but, we, are, all, too, frequently, willing, to, grasp, at, unrealistic, promises, of, a, better, life, psychology, has, much, to, discuss, about, pseudoscience, thinking, as, it, is, the, illusory, perceptions, of, causality, and, effectiveness, of, numerous, individuals, that, needs, to, be, illuminated, research, suggests, that, illusionary, thinking, happens, in, most, people, when, exposed, to, certain, circumstances, such, as, reading, a, book, an, advertisement, or, the, testimony, of, others, are, the, basis, of, pseudoscience, beliefs, it, is, assumed, that, illusions, are, not, unusual, and, given, the, right, conditions, illusions, are, able, to, occur, systematically, even, in, normal, emotional, situations, one, of, the, things, pseudoscience, believers, quibble, most, about, is, that, academic, science, usually, treats, them, as, fools, minimizing, these, illusions, in, the, real, world, is, not, simple, to, this, aim, designing, evidence, based, educational, programs, can, be, effective, to, help, people, identify, and, reduce, their, own, illusions, philosophers, classify, types, of, knowledge, in, english, the, word, science, is, used, to, indicate, specifically, the, natural, sciences, and, related, fields, which, are, called, the, social, sciences, different, philosophers, of, science, may, disagree, on, the, exact, limits, for, example, is, mathematics, a, formal, science, that, is, closer, to, the, empirical, ones, or, is, pure, mathematics, closer, to, the, philosophical, study, of, logic, and, therefore, not, a, science, but, all, agree, that, all, of, the, ideas, that, are, not, scientific, are, non, scientific, the, large, category, of, non, science, includes, all, matters, outside, the, natural, and, social, sciences, such, as, the, study, of, history, metaphysics, religion, art, and, the, humanities, dividing, the, category, again, unscientific, claims, are, a, subset, of, the, large, category, of, non, scientific, claims, this, category, specifically, includes, all, matters, that, are, directly, opposed, to, good, science, un, science, includes, both, bad, science, such, as, an, error, made, in, a, good, faith, attempt, at, learning, something, about, the, natural, world, and, pseudoscience, thus, pseudoscience, is, a, subset, of, un, science, and, un, science, in, turn, is, subset, of, non, science, science, is, also, distinguishable, from, revelation, theology, or, spirituality, in, that, it, offers, insight, into, the, physical, world, obtained, by, empirical, research, and, testing, the, most, notable, disputes, concern, the, evolution, of, living, organisms, the, idea, of, common, descent, the, geologic, history, of, the, earth, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, and, the, origin, of, the, universe, systems, of, belief, that, derive, from, divine, or, inspired, knowledge, are, not, considered, pseudoscience, if, they, do, not, claim, either, to, be, scientific, or, to, overturn, well, established, science, moreover, some, specific, religious, claims, such, as, the, power, of, intercessory, prayer, to, heal, the, sick, although, they, may, be, based, on, untestable, beliefs, can, be, tested, by, the, scientific, method, some, statements, and, common, beliefs, of, popular, science, may, not, meet, the, criteria, of, science, pop, science, may, blur, the, divide, between, science, and, pseudoscience, among, the, general, public, and, may, also, involve, science, fiction, indeed, pop, science, is, disseminated, to, and, can, also, easily, emanate, from, persons, not, accountable, to, scientific, methodology, and, expert, peer, review, if, claims, of, a, given, field, can, be, tested, experimentally, and, standards, are, upheld, it, is, not, pseudoscience, regardless, of, how, odd, astonishing, or, counterintuitive, those, claims, are, if, claims, made, are, inconsistent, with, existing, experimental, results, or, established, theory, but, the, method, is, sound, caution, should, be, used, since, science, consists, of, testing, hypotheses, which, may, turn, out, to, be, false, in, such, a, case, the, work, may, be, better, described, as, ideas, that, are, not, yet, generally, accepted, protoscience, is, a, term, sometimes, used, to, describe, a, hypothesis, that, has, not, yet, been, tested, adequately, by, the, scientific, method, but, which, is, otherwise, consistent, with, existing, science, or, which, where, inconsistent, offers, reasonable, account, of, the, inconsistency, it, may, also, describe, the, transition, from, a, body, of, practical, knowledge, into, a, scientific, field, karl, popper, stated, it, is, insufficient, to, distinguish, science, from, pseudoscience, or, from, metaphysics, such, as, the, philosophical, question, of, what, existence, means, by, the, criterion, of, rigorous, adherence, to, the, empirical, method, which, is, essentially, inductive, based, on, observation, or, experimentation, he, proposed, a, method, to, distinguish, between, genuine, empirical, nonempirical, or, even, pseudoempirical, methods, the, latter, case, was, exemplified, by, astrology, which, appeals, to, observation, and, experimentation, while, it, had, empirical, evidence, based, on, observation, on, horoscopes, and, biographies, it, crucially, failed, to, use, acceptable, scientific, standards, popper, proposed, falsifiability, as, an, important, criterion, in, distinguishing, science, from, pseudoscience, to, demonstrate, this, point, popper, gave, two, cases, of, human, behavior, and, typical, explanations, from, sigmund, freud, and, alfred, adler, s, theories, that, of, a, man, who, pushes, a, child, into, the, water, with, the, intention, of, drowning, it, and, that, of, a, man, who, sacrifices, his, life, in, an, attempt, to, save, the, child, from, freud, s, perspective, the, first, man, would, have, suffered, from, psychological, repression, probably, originating, from, an, oedipus, complex, whereas, the, second, man, had, attained, sublimation, from, adler, s, perspective, the, first, and, second, man, suffered, from, feelings, of, inferiority, and, had, to, prove, himself, which, drove, him, to, commit, the, crime, or, in, the, second, case, drove, him, to, rescue, the, child, popper, was, not, able, to, find, any, counterexamples, of, human, behavior, in, which, the, behavior, could, not, be, explained, in, the, terms, of, adler, s, or, freud, s, theory, popper, argued, it, was, that, the, observation, always, fitted, or, confirmed, the, theory, which, rather, than, being, its, strength, was, actually, its, weakness, in, contrast, popper, gave, the, example, of, einstein, s, gravitational, theory, which, predicted, light, must, be, attracted, by, heavy, bodies, such, as, the, sun, precisely, as, material, bodies, were, attracted, following, from, this, stars, closer, to, the, sun, would, appear, to, have, moved, a, small, distance, away, from, the, sun, and, away, from, each, other, this, prediction, was, particularly, striking, to, popper, because, it, involved, considerable, risk, the, brightness, of, the, sun, prevented, this, effect, from, being, observed, under, normal, circumstances, so, photographs, had, to, be, taken, during, an, eclipse, and, compared, to, photographs, taken, at, night, popper, states, if, observation, shows, that, the, predicted, effect, is, definitely, absent, then, the, theory, is, simply, refuted, popper, summed, up, his, criterion, for, the, scientific, status, of, a, theory, as, depending, on, its, falsifiability, refutability, or, testability, paul, r, thagard, used, astrology, as, a, case, study, to, distinguish, science, from, pseudoscience, and, proposed, principles, and, criteria, to, delineate, them, first, astrology, has, not, progressed, in, that, it, has, not, been, updated, nor, added, any, explanatory, power, since, ptolemy, second, it, has, ignored, outstanding, problems, such, as, the, precession, of, equinoxes, in, astronomy, third, alternative, theories, of, personality, and, behavior, have, grown, progressively, to, encompass, explanations, of, phenomena, which, astrology, statically, attributes, to, heavenly, forces, fourth, astrologers, have, remained, uninterested, in, furthering, the, theory, to, deal, with, outstanding, problems, or, in, critically, evaluating, the, theory, in, relation, to, other, theories, thagard, intended, this, criterion, to, be, extended, to, areas, other, than, astrology, he, believed, it, would, delineate, as, pseudoscientific, such, practices, as, witchcraft, and, pyramidology, while, leaving, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, and, archaeology, in, the, realm, of, science, in, the, philosophy, and, history, of, science, imre, lakatos, stresses, the, social, and, political, importance, of, the, demarcation, problem, the, normative, methodological, problem, of, distinguishing, between, science, and, pseudoscience, his, distinctive, historical, analysis, of, scientific, methodology, based, on, research, programmes, suggests, scientists, regard, the, successful, theoretical, prediction, of, stunning, novel, facts, such, as, the, return, of, halley, s, comet, or, the, gravitational, bending, of, light, rays, as, what, demarcates, good, scientific, theories, from, pseudo, scientific, and, degenerate, theories, and, in, spite, of, all, scientific, theories, being, forever, confronted, by, an, ocean, of, counterexamples, lakatos, offers, a, novel, fallibilist, analysis, of, the, development, of, newton, s, celestial, dynamics, favourite, historical, example, of, his, methodology, and, argues, in, light, of, this, historical, turn, that, his, account, answers, for, certain, inadequacies, in, those, of, karl, popper, and, thomas, kuhn, nonetheless, lakatos, did, recognize, the, force, of, kuhn, s, historical, criticism, of, popper, all, important, theories, have, been, surrounded, by, an, ocean, of, anomalies, which, on, a, falsificationist, view, would, require, the, rejection, of, the, theory, outright, lakatos, sought, to, reconcile, the, rationalism, of, popperian, falsificationism, with, what, seemed, to, be, its, own, refutation, by, history, many, philosophers, have, tried, to, solve, the, problem, of, demarcation, in, the, following, terms, a, statement, constitutes, knowledge, if, sufficiently, many, people, believe, it, sufficiently, strongly, but, the, history, of, thought, shows, us, that, many, people, were, totally, committed, to, absurd, beliefs, if, the, strengths, of, beliefs, were, a, hallmark, of, knowledge, we, should, have, to, rank, some, tales, about, demons, angels, devils, and, of, heaven, and, hell, as, knowledge, scientists, on, the, other, hand, are, very, sceptical, even, of, their, best, theories, newton, s, is, the, most, powerful, theory, science, has, yet, produced, but, newton, himself, never, believed, that, bodies, attract, each, other, at, a, distance, so, no, degree, of, commitment, to, beliefs, makes, them, knowledge, indeed, the, hallmark, of, scientific, behaviour, is, a, certain, scepticism, even, towards, one, s, most, cherished, theories, blind, commitment, to, a, theory, is, not, an, intellectual, virtue, it, is, an, intellectual, crime, thus, a, statement, may, be, pseudoscientific, even, if, it, is, eminently, plausible, and, everybody, believes, in, it, and, it, may, be, scientifically, valuable, even, if, it, is, unbelievable, and, nobody, believes, in, it, a, theory, may, even, be, of, supreme, scientific, value, even, if, no, one, understands, it, let, alone, believes, in, it, the, boundary, between, science, and, pseudoscience, is, disputed, and, difficult, to, determine, analytically, even, after, more, than, a, century, of, study, by, philosophers, of, science, and, scientists, and, despite, some, basic, agreements, on, the, fundamentals, of, the, scientific, method, the, concept, of, pseudoscience, rests, on, an, understanding, that, the, scientific, method, has, been, misrepresented, or, misapplied, with, respect, to, a, given, theory, but, many, philosophers, of, science, maintain, that, different, kinds, of, methods, are, held, as, appropriate, across, different, fields, and, different, eras, of, human, history, according, to, lakatos, the, typical, descriptive, unit, of, great, scientific, achievements, is, not, an, isolated, hypothesis, but, a, powerful, problem, solving, machinery, which, with, the, help, of, sophisticated, mathematical, techniques, digests, anomalies, and, even, turns, them, into, positive, evidence, to, popper, pseudoscience, uses, induction, to, generate, theories, and, only, performs, experiments, to, seek, to, verify, them, to, popper, falsifiability, is, what, determines, the, scientific, status, of, a, theory, taking, a, historical, approach, kuhn, observed, that, scientists, did, not, follow, popper, s, rule, and, might, ignore, falsifying, data, unless, overwhelming, to, kuhn, puzzle, solving, within, a, paradigm, is, science, lakatos, attempted, to, resolve, this, debate, by, suggesting, history, shows, that, science, occurs, in, research, programmes, competing, according, to, how, progressive, they, are, the, leading, idea, of, a, programme, could, evolve, driven, by, its, heuristic, to, make, predictions, that, can, be, supported, by, evidence, feyerabend, claimed, that, lakatos, was, selective, in, his, examples, and, the, whole, history, of, science, shows, there, is, no, universal, rule, of, scientific, method, and, imposing, one, on, the, scientific, community, impedes, progress, laudan, maintained, that, the, demarcation, between, science, and, non, science, was, a, pseudo, problem, preferring, to, focus, on, the, more, general, distinction, between, reliable, and, unreliable, knowledge, regards, lakatos, s, view, as, being, closet, anarchism, disguised, as, methodological, rationalism, feyerabend, s, claim, was, not, that, standard, methodological, rules, should, never, be, obeyed, but, rather, that, sometimes, progress, is, made, by, abandoning, them, in, the, absence, of, a, generally, accepted, rule, there, is, a, need, for, alternative, methods, of, persuasion, according, to, feyerabend, galileo, employed, stylistic, and, rhetorical, techniques, to, convince, his, reader, while, he, also, wrote, in, italian, rather, than, latin, and, directed, his, arguments, to, those, already, temperamentally, inclined, to, accept, them, the, demarcation, problem, between, science, and, pseudoscience, brings, up, debate, in, the, realms, of, science, philosophy, and, politics, imre, lakatos, for, instance, points, out, that, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, at, one, point, declared, that, mendelian, genetics, was, pseudoscientific, and, had, its, advocates, including, well, established, scientists, such, as, nikolai, vavilov, sent, to, a, gulag, and, that, the, liberal, establishment, of, the, west, denies, freedom, of, speech, to, topics, it, regards, as, pseudoscience, particularly, where, they, run, up, against, social, mores, something, becomes, pseudoscientific, when, science, cannot, be, separated, from, ideology, scientists, misrepresent, scientific, findings, to, promote, or, draw, attention, for, publicity, when, politicians, journalists, and, a, nation, s, intellectual, elite, distort, the, facts, of, science, for, short, term, political, gain, or, when, powerful, individuals, of, the, public, conflate, causation, and, cofactors, by, clever, wordplay, these, ideas, reduce, the, authority, value, integrity, and, independence, of, science, in, society, distinguishing, science, from, pseudoscience, has, practical, implications, in, the, case, of, health, care, expert, testimony, environmental, policies, and, science, education, treatments, with, a, patina, of, scientific, authority, which, have, not, actually, been, subjected, to, actual, scientific, testing, may, be, ineffective, expensive, and, dangerous, to, patients, and, confuse, health, providers, insurers, government, decision, makers, and, the, public, as, to, what, treatments, are, appropriate, claims, advanced, by, pseudoscience, may, result, in, government, officials, and, educators, making, bad, decisions, in, selecting, curricula, the, extent, to, which, students, acquire, a, range, of, social, and, cognitive, thinking, skills, related, to, the, proper, usage, of, science, and, technology, determines, whether, they, are, scientifically, literate, education, in, the, sciences, encounters, new, dimensions, with, the, changing, landscape, of, science, and, technology, a, fast, changing, culture, and, a, knowledge, driven, era, a, reinvention, of, the, school, science, curriculum, is, one, that, shapes, students, to, contend, with, its, changing, influence, on, human, welfare, scientific, literacy, which, allows, a, person, to, distinguish, science, from, pseudosciences, such, as, astrology, is, among, the, attributes, that, enable, students, to, adapt, to, the, changing, world, its, characteristics, are, embedded, in, a, curriculum, where, students, are, engaged, in, resolving, problems, conducting, investigations, or, developing, projects, alan, j, friedman, mentions, why, most, scientists, avoid, educating, about, pseudoscience, including, that, paying, undue, attention, to, pseudoscience, could, dignify, it, on, the, other, hand, robert, l, park, emphasizes, how, pseudoscience, can, be, a, threat, to, society, and, considers, that, scientists, have, a, responsibility, to, teach, how, to, distinguish, science, from, pseudoscience, pseudosciences, such, as, homeopathy, even, if, generally, benign, are, used, by, charlatans, this, poses, a, serious, issue, because, it, enables, incompetent, practitioners, to, administer, health, care, true, believing, zealots, may, pose, a, more, serious, threat, than, typical, con, men, because, of, their, delusion, to, homeopathy, s, ideology, irrational, health, care, is, not, harmless, and, it, is, careless, to, create, patient, confidence, in, pseudomedicine, on, 8, december, 2016, journalist, michael, v, levine, pointed, out, the, dangers, posed, by, the, natural, news, website, snake, oil, salesmen, have, pushed, false, cures, since, the, dawn, of, medicine, and, now, websites, like, natural, news, flood, social, media, with, dangerous, anti, pharmaceutical, anti, vaccination, and, anti, gmo, pseudoscience, that, puts, millions, at, risk, of, contracting, preventable, illnesses, the, anti, vaccine, movement, has, persuaded, large, numbers, of, parents, not, to, vaccinate, their, children, citing, pseudoscientific, research, that, links, childhood, vaccines, with, the, onset, of, autism, these, include, the, study, by, andrew, wakefield, which, claimed, that, a, combination, of, gastrointestinal, disease, and, developmental, regression, which, are, often, seen, in, children, with, asd, occurred, within, two, weeks, of, receiving, vaccines, the, study, was, eventually, retracted, by, its, publisher, and, wakefield, was, stripped, of, his, license, to, practice,
