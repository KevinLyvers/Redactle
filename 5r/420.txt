the, phoenix, is, an, immortal, bird, that, cyclically, regenerates, or, is, otherwise, born, again, while, it, is, part, of, greek, mythology, it, has, analogs, in, many, cultures, such, as, egyptian, and, persian, associated, with, the, sun, a, phoenix, obtains, new, life, by, rising, from, the, ashes, of, its, predecessor, some, legends, say, it, dies, in, a, show, of, flames, and, combustion, while, others, that, it, simply, dies, and, decomposes, before, being, born, again, in, the, motif, index, of, folk, literature, a, tool, used, by, folklorists, the, phoenix, is, classified, as, motif, b32, the, origin, of, the, phoenix, has, been, attributed, to, ancient, egypt, by, herodotus, and, later, 19th, century, scholars, but, other, scholars, think, the, egyptian, texts, may, have, been, influenced, by, classical, folklore, over, time, the, phoenix, motif, spread, and, gained, a, variety, of, new, associations, herodotus, lucan, pliny, the, elder, pope, clement, i, lactantius, ovid, and, isidore, of, seville, are, among, those, who, have, contributed, to, the, retelling, and, transmission, of, the, phoenix, motif, over, time, extending, beyond, its, origins, the, phoenix, could, variously, symbolize, renewal, in, general, as, well, as, the, sun, time, the, roman, empire, metempsychosis, consecration, resurrection, life, in, the, heavenly, paradise, christ, mary, virginity, the, exceptional, man, and, certain, aspects, of, christian, life, some, scholars, have, claimed, that, the, poem, de, ave, phoenice, may, present, the, mythological, phoenix, motif, as, a, symbol, of, christ, s, resurrection, the, modern, english, word, phoenix, entered, the, english, language, from, latin, later, reinforced, by, french, the, word, first, entered, the, english, language, by, way, of, a, borrowing, of, latin, phoen, x, into, old, english, fenix, this, borrowing, was, later, reinforced, by, french, influence, which, had, also, borrowed, the, latin, noun, in, time, the, word, developed, specialized, use, in, the, english, language, for, example, the, term, could, refer, to, an, excellent, person, 12th, century, a, variety, of, heraldic, emblem, 15th, century, and, the, name, of, a, constellation, 17th, century, the, latin, word, comes, from, greek, phoinix, the, greek, word, is, first, attested, in, the, mycenaean, greek, po, ni, ke, which, probably, meant, griffin, though, it, might, have, meant, palm, tree, that, word, is, probably, a, borrowing, from, a, west, semitic, word, for, madder, a, red, dye, made, from, rubia, tinctorum, the, word, phoenician, appears, to, be, from, the, same, root, meaning, those, who, work, with, red, dyes, so, phoenix, may, mean, the, phoenician, bird, or, the, purplish, red, bird, apart, from, the, linear, b, mention, above, from, mycenaean, greece, the, earliest, clear, mention, of, the, phoenix, in, ancient, greek, literature, occurs, in, a, fragment, of, the, precepts, of, chiron, attributed, to, 8th, century, bc, greek, poet, hesiod, in, the, fragment, the, wise, centaur, chiron, tells, a, young, hero, achilles, the, following, describing, the, phoenix, s, lifetime, as, 972, times, the, length, of, a, long, lived, human, s, a, chattering, crow, lives, now, nine, generations, of, aged, men, but, a, stag, s, life, is, four, time, a, crow, s, and, a, raven, s, life, makes, three, stags, old, while, the, phoenix, outlives, nine, ravens, but, we, the, rich, haired, nymphs, daughters, of, zeus, the, aegis, holder, outlive, ten, phoenixes, classical, discourse, on, the, subject, of, the, phoenix, attributes, a, potential, origin, of, the, phoenix, to, ancient, egypt, herodotus, writing, in, the, 5th, century, bc, provides, the, following, account, of, the, phoenix, have, also, another, sacred, bird, called, the, phoenix, which, i, myself, have, never, seen, except, in, pictures, indeed, it, is, a, great, rarity, even, in, egypt, only, coming, there, according, to, the, accounts, of, the, people, of, heliopolis, once, in, five, hundred, years, when, the, old, phoenix, dies, its, size, and, appearance, if, it, is, like, the, pictures, are, as, follow, the, plumage, is, partly, red, partly, golden, while, the, general, make, and, size, are, almost, exactly, that, of, the, eagle, they, tell, a, story, of, what, this, bird, does, which, does, not, seem, to, me, to, be, credible, that, he, comes, all, the, way, from, arabia, and, brings, the, parent, bird, all, plastered, over, with, myrrh, to, the, temple, of, the, sun, and, there, buries, the, body, in, order, to, bring, him, they, say, he, first, forms, a, ball, of, myrrh, as, big, as, he, finds, that, he, can, carry, then, he, hollows, out, the, ball, and, puts, his, parent, inside, after, which, he, covers, over, the, opening, with, fresh, myrrh, and, the, ball, is, then, of, exactly, the, same, weight, as, at, first, so, he, brings, it, to, egypt, plastered, over, as, i, have, said, and, deposits, it, in, the, temple, of, the, sun, such, is, the, story, they, tell, of, the, doings, of, this, bird, in, the, 19th, century, scholastic, suspicions, appeared, to, be, confirmed, by, the, discovery, that, egyptians, in, heliopolis, had, venerated, the, bennu, a, solar, bird, similar, in, some, respects, to, the, greek, phoenix, however, the, egyptian, sources, regarding, the, bennu, are, often, problematic, and, open, to, a, variety, of, interpretations, some, of, these, sources, may, have, actually, been, influenced, by, greek, notions, of, the, phoenix, rather, than, the, other, way, around, the, phoenix, is, sometimes, pictured, in, ancient, and, medieval, literature, and, medieval, art, as, endowed, with, a, halo, which, emphasizes, the, bird, s, connection, with, the, sun, in, the, oldest, images, of, phoenixes, on, record, these, nimbuses, often, have, seven, rays, like, helios, the, greek, personification, of, the, sun, pliny, the, elder, also, describes, the, bird, as, having, a, crest, of, feathers, on, its, head, and, ezekiel, the, dramatist, compared, it, to, a, rooster, the, phoenix, came, to, be, associated, with, specific, colors, over, time, although, the, phoenix, was, generally, believed, to, be, colorful, and, vibrant, sources, provide, no, clear, consensus, about, its, coloration, tacitus, says, that, its, color, made, it, stand, out, from, all, other, birds, some, said, that, the, bird, had, peacock, like, coloring, and, herodotus, s, claim, of, the, phoenix, being, red, and, yellow, is, popular, in, many, versions, of, the, story, on, record, ezekiel, the, tragedian, declared, that, the, phoenix, had, red, legs, and, striking, yellow, eyes, but, lactantius, said, that, its, eyes, were, blue, like, sapphires, and, that, its, legs, were, covered, in, yellow, gold, scales, with, rose, colored, talons, herodotus, pliny, solinus, and, philostratus, describe, the, phoenix, as, similar, in, size, to, an, eagle, but, lactantius, and, ezekiel, the, dramatist, both, claim, that, the, phoenix, was, larger, with, lactantius, declaring, that, it, was, even, larger, than, an, ostrich, according, to, pliny, s, natural, history, aquilae, narratur, magnitudine, auri, fulgore, circa, colla, cetero, purpureus, caeruleam, roseis, caudam, pinnis, distinguentibus, cristis, fauces, caputque, plumeo, apice, honestante, the, story, is, that, it, is, as, large, as, an, eagle, and, has, a, gleam, of, gold, round, its, neck, and, all, the, rest, of, it, is, purple, but, the, tail, blue, picked, out, with, rosecoloured, feathers, and, the, throat, picked, out, with, tufts, and, a, feathered, crest, adorning, its, head, according, to, claudian, s, poem, the, phoenix, arcanum, radiant, oculi, iubar,

own, light, and, shatters, the, darkness, with, its, calm, brilliance, its, legs, are, of, tyrian, purple, swifter, than, those, of, the, zephyrs, are, its, wings, of, flower, like, blue, dappled, with, rich, gold, according, to, pliny, the, elder, a, senator, manilius, marcus, manilius, had, written, that, the, phoenix, appeared, at, the, end, of, each, great, year, which, he, wrote, of, in, the, consulship, of, gnaeus, cornelius, and, publius, licinius, that, is, in, 96, bc, that, a, cycle, was, 540, years, and, that, it, was, 215, into, the, cycle, i, e, it, began, in, 311, bc, another, of, pliny, s, sources, cornelius, valerianus, is, cited, for, an, appearance, of, the, phoenix, in, 36, ad, in, the, consulship, of, quintus, plautius, and, sextus, papinius, pliny, states, that, a, purported, phoenix, seen, in, egypt, in, 47, ad, was, brought, to, the, capital, and, exhibited, in, the, comitium, in, time, for, the, 800th, anniversary, of, the, foundation, of, rome, by, romulus, though, he, added, that, nobody, would, doubt, that, this, phoenix, was, a, fabrication, a, second, recording, of, the, phoenix, was, made, by, tacitus, who, said, that, the, phoenix, had, appeared, instead, in, 34, ad, in, the, consulship, of, paulus, fabius, and, lucius, vitellius, and, that, the, cycle, was, either, 500, years, or, 1461, years, which, was, the, great, year, based, on, the, egyptian, sothic, cycle, and, that, it, had, previously, been, seen, in, the, reigns, first, of, sesosis, then, of, amasis, and, finally, of, ptolemy, third, of, the, macedonian, dynasty, a, third, recording, was, made, by, cassius, dio, who, also, said, that, the, phoenix, was, seen, in, the, consulship, of, quintus, plautus, and, sextus, papinius, in, time, the, motif, and, concept, of, the, phoenix, extended, from, its, origins, in, ancient, greek, folklore, for, example, the, classical, motif, of, the, phoenix, continues, into, the, gnostic, manuscript, on, the, origin, of, the, world, from, the, nag, hammadi, library, collection, in, egypt, generally, dated, to, the, 4th, century, thus, when, sophia, zoe, saw, that, the, rulers, of, darkness, had, laid, a, curse, upon, her, counterparts, she, was, indignant, and, coming, out, of, the, first, heaven, with, full, power, she, chased, those, rulers, out, of, their, heavens, and, cast, them, into, the, sinful, world, so, that, there, they, should, dwell, in, the, form, of, evil, spirits, upon, the, earth, so, that, in, their, world, it, might, pass, the, thousand, years, in, paradise, a, soul, endowed, living, creature, called, phoenix, it, kills, itself, and, brings, itself, back, to, life, as, a, witness, to, the, judgement, against, them, for, they, did, wrong, to, adam, and, his, race, unto, the, consummation, of, the, age, there, are, three, men, and, also, his, posterities, unto, the, consummation, of, the, world, the, spirit, endowed, of, eternity, and, the, soul, endowed, and, the, earthly, likewise, there, are, three, phoenixes, in, paradise, the, first, is, immortal, the, second, lives, 1, 000, years, as, for, the, third, it, is, written, in, the, sacred, book, that, it, is, consumed, so, too, there, are, three, baptisms, the, first, is, spiritual, the, second, is, by, fire, the, third, is, by, water, just, as, the, phoenix, appears, as, a, witness, concerning, the, angels, so, the, case, of, the, water, hydri, in, egypt, which, has, been, a, witness, to, those, going, down, into, the, baptism, of, a, true, man, the, two, bulls, in, egypt, posses, a, mystery, the, sun, and, the, moon, being, a, witness, to, sabaoth, namely, that, over, them, sophia, received, the, universe, from, the, day, that, she, made, the, sun, and, moon, she, put, a, seal, upon, her, heaven, unto, eternity, and, the, worm, that, has, been, born, out, of, the, phoenix, is, a, human, being, as, well, it, is, written, concerning, it, the, just, man, will, blossom, like, a, phoenix, and, the, phoenix, first, appears, in, a, living, state, and, dies, and, rises, again, being, a, sign, of, what, has, become, apparent, at, the, consummation, of, the, age, the, anonymous, 10th, century, old, english, exeter, book, contains, a, 677, line, 9th, century, alliterative, poem, consisting, of, a, paraphrase, and, abbreviation, of, lactantius, followed, by, an, explication, of, the,

sartor, resartus, by, thomas, carlyle, diogenes, teufelsdr, ckh, uses, the, phoenix, as, a, metaphor, for, the, cyclical, pattern, of, history, remarking, upon, the, burning, of, a, world, phoenix, and, the, palingenesia, or, newbirth, of, society, from, its, ashes, when, the, phoenix, is, fanning, her, funeral, pyre, will, there, not, be, sparks, flying, alas, some, millions, of, men, and, among, them, such, as, a, napoleon, have, already, been, licked, into, that, high, eddying, flame, and, like, moths, consumed, there, still, also, have, we, to, fear, that, incautious, beards, will,

pageants, to, the, extent, of, three, hundred, years, and, more, after, all, life, and, sacredness, had, evaporated, out, of, them, and, then, finally, what, time, the, phoenix, death, birth, itself, will, require, depends, on, unseen, contingencies, meanwhile, would, destiny, offer, mankind, that, after, say, two, centuries, of, convulsion, and, conflagration, more, or, less, vivid, the, fire, creation, should, be, accomplished, and, we, to, find, ourselves, again, in, a, living, society, and, no, longer, fighting, but, working, were, it, not, perhaps, prudent, in, mankind, to, strike, the, bargain, phoenixes, are, present, and, relatively, common, in, european, heraldry, which, developed, during, the, high, middle, ages, they, most, often, appear, as, crests, and, more, rarely, as, charges, the, heraldic, phoenix, is, depicted, as, the, head, chest, and, wings, of, an, eagle, rising, from, a, fire, the, entire, creature, is, never, depicted, scholars, have, observed, analogues, to, the, phoenix, in, a, variety, of, cultures, these, analogues, include, the, hindu, garuda, and, bherunda, the, russian, firebird, the, persian, simorgh, the, georgian, paskunji, the, arabian, anqa, the, turkish, konrul, also, called, z, mr, d, anka, emerald, anqa, the, tibetan, me, byi, karmo, the, chinese, fenghuang, and, zhuque, these, perceived, analogues, are, sometimes, included, as,
