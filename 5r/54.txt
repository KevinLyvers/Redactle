truth, or, verity, is, the, property, of, being, in, accord, with, fact, or, reality, in, everyday, language, it, is, typically, ascribed, to, things, that, aim, to, represent, reality, or, otherwise, correspond, to, it, such, as, beliefs, propositions, and, declarative, sentences, truth, is, usually, held, to, be, the, opposite, of, false, statement, the, concept, of, truth, is, discussed, and, debated, in, various, contexts, including, philosophy, art, theology, law, and, science, most, human, activities, depend, upon, the, concept, where, its, nature, as, a, concept, is, assumed, rather, than, being, a, subject, of, discussion, including, journalism, and, everyday, life, some, philosophers, view, the, concept, of, truth, as, basic, and, unable, to, be, explained, in, any, terms, that, are, more, easily, understood, than, the, concept, of, truth, itself, most, commonly, truth, is, viewed, as, the, correspondence, of, language, or, thought, to, a, mind, independent, world, this, is, called, the, correspondence, theory, of, truth, various, theories, and, views, of, truth, continue, to, be, debated, among, scholars, philosophers, and, theologians, there, are, many, different, questions, about, the, nature, of, truth, which, are, still, the, subject, of, contemporary, debates, these, include, the, question, of, defining, truth, whether, it, is, even, possible, to, give, an, informative, definition, of, truth, identifying, things, as, truth, bearers, capable, of, being, true, or, false, if, truth, and, falsehood, are, bivalent, or, if, there, are, other, truth, values, identifying, the, criteria, of, truth, that, allow, us, to, identify, it, and, to, distinguish, it, from, falsehood, the, role, that, truth, plays, in, constituting, knowledge, and, if, truth, is, always, absolute, or, if, it, can, be, relative, to, one, s, perspective, the, english, word, truth, is, derived, from, old, english, tr, ew, tr, ow, tr, w, middle, english, trew, e, cognate, to, old, high, german, triuwida, old, norse, trygg, like, troth, it, is, a, th, nominalisation, of, the, adjective, true, old, english, tr, owe, the, english, word, true, is, from, old, english, west, saxon, ge, tr, ewe, tr, owe, cognate, to, old, saxon, gi, tr, ui, old, high, german, ga, triuwu, modern, german, treu, faithful, old, norse, tryggr, gothic, triggws, all, from, a, proto, germanic, trewwj, having, good, faith, perhaps, ultimately, from, pie, dru, tree, on, the, notion, of, steadfast, as, an, oak, e, g, sanskrit, d, ru, piece, of, wood, old, norse, tr, faith, word, of, honour, religious, faith, belief, archaic, english, troth, loyalty, honesty, good, faith, compare, satr, thus, truth, involves, both, the, quality, of, faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity, and, that, of, agreement, with, fact, or, reality, in, anglo, saxon, expressed, by, s, modern, english, sooth, all, germanic, languages, besides, english, have, introduced, a, terminological, distinction, between, truth, fidelity, and, truth, factuality, to, express, factuality, north, germanic, opted, for, nouns, derived, from, sanna, to, assert, affirm, while, continental, west, germanic, german, and, dutch, opted, for, continuations, of, w, ra, faith, trust, pact, cognate, to, slavic, v, ra, religious, faith, but, influenced, by, latin, verus, romance, languages, use, terms, following, the, latin, veritas, while, the, greek, aletheia, russian, pravda, south, slavic, istina, and, sanskrit, sat, related, to, english, sooth, and, north, germanic, sanna, have, separate, etymological, origins, in, some, modern, contexts, the, word, truth, is, used, to, refer, to, fidelity, to, an, original, or, standard, it, can, also, be, used, in, the, context, of, being, true, to, oneself, in, the, sense, of, acting, with, authenticity, the, question, of, what, is, a, proper, basis, for, deciding, how, words, symbols, ideas, and, beliefs, may, properly, be, considered, true, whether, by, a, single, person, or, an, entire, society, is, dealt, with, by, the, five, most, prevalent, substantive, theories, of, truth, listed, below, each, presents, perspectives, that, are, widely, shared, by, published, scholars, theories, other, than, the, most, prevalent, substantive, theories, are, also, discussed, according, to, a, survey, of, professional, philosophers, and, others, on, their, philosophical, views, which, was, carried, out, in, november, 2009, taken, by, 3226, respondents, including, 1803, philosophy, faculty, members, and, or, phds, and, 829, philosophy, graduate, students, 45, of, respondents, accept, or, lean, toward, correspondence, theories, 21, accept, or, lean, toward, deflationary, theories, and, 14, epistemic, theories, correspondence, theories, emphasize, that, true, beliefs, and, true, statements, correspond, to, the, actual, state, of, affairs, this, type, of, theory, stresses, a, relationship, between, thoughts, or, statements, on, one, hand, and, things, or, objects, on, the, other, it, is, a, traditional, model, tracing, its, origins, to, ancient, greek, philosophers, such, as, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, this, class, of, theories, holds, that, the, truth, or, the, falsity, of, a, representation, is, determined, in, principle, entirely, by, how, it, relates, to, things, according, to, whether, it, accurately, describes, those, things, a, classic, example, of, correspondence, theory, is, the, statement, by, the, thirteenth, century, philosopher, and, theologian, thomas, aquinas, veritas, est, adaequatio, rei, et, intellectus, truth, is, the, adequation, of, things, and, intellect, which, aquinas, attributed, to, the, ninth, century, neoplatonist, isaac, israeli, aquinas, also, restated, the, theory, as, a, judgment, is, said, to, be, true, when, it, conforms, to, the, external, reality, correspondence, theory, centres, heavily, around, the, assumption, that, truth, is, a, matter, of, accurately, copying, what, is, known, as, objective, reality, and, then, representing, it, in, thoughts, words, and, other, symbols, many, modern, theorists, have, stated, that, this, ideal, cannot, be, achieved, without, analysing, additional, factors, for, example, language, plays, a, role, in, that, all, languages, have, words, to, represent, concepts, that, are, virtually, undefined, in, other, languages, the, german, word, zeitgeist, is, one, such, example, one, who, speaks, or, understands, the, language, may, know, what, it, means, but, any, translation, of, the, word, apparently, fails, to, accurately, capture, its, full, meaning, this, is, a, problem, with, many, abstract, words, especially, those, derived, in, agglutinative, languages, thus, some, words, add, an, additional, parameter, to, the, construction, of, an, accurate, truth, predicate, among, the, philosophers, who, grappled, with, this, problem, is, alfred, tarski, whose, semantic, theory, is, summarized, further, on, proponents, of, several, of, the, theories, below, have, gone, further, to, assert, that, there, are, yet, other, issues, necessary, to, the, analysis, such, as, interpersonal, power, struggles, community, interactions, personal, biases, and, other, factors, involved, in, deciding, what, is, seen, as, truth, for, coherence, theories, in, general, truth, requires, a, proper, fit, of, elements, within, a, whole, system, very, often, coherence, is, taken, to, imply, something, more, than, simple, logical, consistency, often, there, is, a, demand, that, the, propositions, in, a, coherent, system, lend, mutual, inferential, support, to, each, other, so, for, example, the, completeness, and, comprehensiveness, of, the, underlying, set, of, concepts, is, a, critical, factor, in, judging, the, validity, and, usefulness, of, a, coherent, system, a, pervasive, tenet, of, coherence, theories, is, the, idea, that, truth, is, primarily, a, property, of, whole, systems, of, propositions, and, can, be, ascribed, to, individual, propositions, only, according, to, their, coherence, with, the, whole, among, the, assortment, of, perspectives, commonly, regarded, as, coherence, theory, theorists, differ, on, the, question, of, whether, coherence, entails, many, possible, true, systems, of, thought, or, only, a, single, absolute, system, some, variants, of, coherence, theory, are, claimed, to, describe, the, essential, and, intrinsic, properties, of, formal, systems, in, logic, and, mathematics, formal, reasoners, are, content, to, contemplate, axiomatically, independent, and, sometimes, mutually, contradictory, systems, side, by, side, for, example, the, various, alternative, geometries, on, the, whole, coherence, theories, have, been, rejected, for, lacking, justification, in, their, application, to, other, areas, of, truth, especially, with, respect, to, assertions, about, the, natural, world, empirical, data, in, general, assertions, about, practical, matters, of, psychology, and, society, especially, when, used, without, support, from, the, other, major, theories, of, truth, coherence, theories, distinguish, the, thought, of, rationalist, philosophers, particularly, of, baruch, spinoza, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, and, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, along, with, the, british, philosopher, f, h, bradley, they, have, found, a, resurgence, also, among, several, proponents, of, logical, positivism, notably, otto, neurath, and, carl, hempel, the, three, most, influential, forms, of, the, pragmatic, theory, of, truth, were, introduced, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, by, charles, sanders, peirce, william, james, and, john, dewey, although, there, are, wide, differences, in, viewpoint, among, these, and, other, proponents, of, pragmatic, theory, they, hold, in, common, that, truth, is, verified, and, confirmed, by, the, results, of, putting, one, s, concepts, into, practice, peirce, defines, it, truth, is, that, concordance, of, an, abstract, statement, with, the, ideal, limit, towards, which, endless, investigation, would, tend, to, bring, scientific, belief, which, concordance, the, abstract, statement, may, possess, by, virtue, of, the, confession, of, its, inaccuracy, and, one, sidedness, and, this, confession, is, an, essential, ingredient, of, truth, this, statement, stresses, peirce, s, view, that, ideas, of, approximation, incompleteness, and, partiality, what, he, describes, elsewhere, as, fallibilism, and, reference, to, the, future, are, essential, to, a, proper, conception, of, truth, although, peirce, uses, words, like, concordance, and, correspondence, to, describe, one, aspect, of, the, pragmatic, sign, relation, he, is, also, quite, explicit, in, saying, that, definitions, of, truth, based, on, mere, correspondence, are, no, more, than, nominal, definitions, which, he, accords, a, lower, status, than, real, definitions, james, version, of, pragmatic, theory, while, complex, is, often, summarized, by, his, statement, that, the, true, is, only, the, expedient, in, our, way, of, thinking, just, as, the, right, is, only, the, expedient, in, our, way, of, behaving, by, this, james, meant, that, truth, is, a, quality, the, value, of, which, is, confirmed, by, its, effectiveness, when, applying, concepts, to, practice, thus, pragmatic, dewey, less, broadly, than, james, but, more, broadly, than, peirce, held, that, inquiry, whether, scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical, or, cultural, is, self, corrective, over, time, if, openly, submitted, for, testing, by, a, community, of, inquirers, in, order, to, clarify, justify, refine, and, or, refute, proposed, truths, though, not, widely, known, a, new, variation, of, the, pragmatic, theory, was, defined, and, wielded, successfully, from, the, 20th, century, forward, defined, and, named, by, william, ernest, hocking, this, variation, is, known, as, negative, pragmatism, essentially, what, works, may, or, may, not, be, true, but, what, fails, cannot, be, true, because, the, truth, always, works, philosopher, of, science, richard, feynman, also, subscribed, to, it, we, never, are, definitely, right, we, can, only, be, sure, we, are, wrong, this, approach, incorporates, many, of, the, ideas, from, peirce, james, and, dewey, for, peirce, the, idea, of, endless, investigation, would, tend, to, bring, about, scientific, belief, fits, negative, pragmatism, in, that, a, negative, pragmatist, would, never, stop, testing, as, feynman, noted, an, idea, or, theory, could, never, be, proved, right, because, tomorrow, s, experiment, might, succeed, in, proving, wrong, what, you, thought, was, right, similarly, james, and, dewey, s, ideas, also, ascribe, truth, to, repeated, testing, which, is, self, corrective, over, time, pragmatism, and, negative, pragmatism, are, also, closely, aligned, with, the, coherence, theory, of, truth, in, that, any, testing, should, not, be, isolated, but, rather, incorporate, knowledge, from, all, human, endeavors, and, experience, the, universe, is, a, whole, and, integrated, system, and, testing, should, acknowledge, and, account, for, its, diversity, as, feynman, said, if, it, disagrees, with, experiment, it, is, wrong, social, constructivism, holds, that, truth, is, constructed, by, social, processes, is, historically, and, culturally, specific, and, that, it, is, in, part, shaped, through, the, power, struggles, within, a, community, constructivism, views, all, of, our, knowledge, as, constructed, because, it, does, not, reflect, any, external, transcendent, realities, as, a, pure, correspondence, theory, might, hold, rather, perceptions, of, truth, are, viewed, as, contingent, on, convention, human, perception, and, social, experience, it, is, believed, by, constructivists, that, representations, of, physical, and, biological, reality, including, race, sexuality, and, gender, are, socially, constructed, giambattista, vico, was, among, the, first, to, claim, that, history, and, culture, were, man, made, vico, s, epistemological, orientation, unfolds, in, one, axiom, verum, ipsum, factum, truth, itself, is, constructed, hegel, and, marx, were, among, the, other, early, proponents, of, the, premise, that, truth, is, or, can, be, socially, constructed, marx, like, many, critical, theorists, who, followed, did, not, reject, the, existence, of, objective, truth, but, rather, distinguished, between, true, knowledge, and, knowledge, that, has, been, distorted, through, power, or, ideology, for, marx, scientific, and, true, knowledge, is, in, accordance, with, the, dialectical, understanding, of, history, and, ideological, knowledge, is, an, epiphenomenal, expression, of, the, relation, of, material, forces, in, a, given, economic, arrangement, consensus, theory, holds, that, truth, is, whatever, is, agreed, upon, or, in, some, versions, might, come, to, be, agreed, upon, by, some, specified, group, such, a, group, might, include, all, human, beings, or, a, subset, thereof, consisting, of, more, than, one, person, among, the, current, advocates, of, consensus, theory, as, a, useful, accounting, of, the, concept, of, truth, is, the, philosopher, j, rgen, habermas, habermas, maintains, that, truth, is, what, would, be, agreed, upon, in, an, ideal, speech, situation, among, the, current, strong, critics, of, consensus, theory, is, the, philosopher, nicholas, rescher, modern, developments, in, the, field, of, philosophy, have, resulted, in, the, rise, of, a, new, thesis, that, the, term, truth, does, not, denote, a, real, property, of, sentences, or, propositions, this, thesis, is, in, part, a, response, to, the, common, use, of, truth, predicates, e, g, that, some, particular, thing, is, true, which, was, particularly, prevalent, in, philosophical, discourse, on, truth, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, from, this, point, of, view, to, assert, that, 2, 2, 4, is, true, is, logically, equivalent, to, asserting, that, 2, 2, 4, and, the, phrase, is, true, is, philosophically, if, not, practically, see, michael, example, below, completely, dispensable, in, this, and, every, other, context, in, common, parlance, truth, predicates, are, not, commonly, heard, and, it, would, be, interpreted, as, an, unusual, occurrence, were, someone, to, utilize, a, truth, predicate, in, an, everyday, conversation, when, asserting, that, something, is, true, newer, perspectives, that, take, this, discrepancy, into, account, and, work, with, sentence, structures, as, actually, employed, in, common, discourse, can, be, broadly, described, whichever, term, is, used, deflationary, theories, can, be, said, to, hold, in, common, that, the, predicate, true, is, an, expressive, convenience, not, the, name, of, a, property, requiring, deep, analysis, once, we, have, identified, the, truth, predicate, s, formal, features, and, utility, deflationists, argue, we, have, said, all, there, is, to, be, said, about, truth, among, the, theoretical, concerns, of, these, views, is, to, explain, away, those, special, cases, where, it, does, appear, that, the, concept, of, truth, has, peculiar, and, interesting, properties, see, e, g, semantic, paradoxes, and, below, the, scope, of, deflationary, principles, is, generally, limited, to, representations, that, resemble, sentences, they, do, not, encompass, a, broader, range, of, entities, that, are, typically, considered, true, or, otherwise, in, addition, some, deflationists, point, out, that, the, concept, employed, in, is, true, formulations, does, enable, us, to, express, things, that, might, otherwise, require, infinitely, long, sentences, for, example, one, cannot, express, confidence, in, michael, s, accuracy, by, asserting, the, endless, sentence, this, assertion, can, instead, be, succinctly, expressed, by, saying, what, michael, says, is, true, an, early, variety, of, deflationary, theory, is, the, redundancy, theory, of, truth, so, called, because, in, examples, like, those, above, e, g, snow, is, white, the, concept, of, truth, is, redundant, and, need, not, have, been, articulated, that, is, it, is, merely, a, word, that, is, traditionally, used, in, conversation, or, writing, generally, for, emphasis, but, not, a, word, that, actually, equates, to, anything, in, reality, this, theory, is, commonly, attributed, to, frank, p, ramsey, who, held, that, the, use, of, words, like, fact, and, truth, was, nothing, but, a, roundabout, way, of, asserting, a, proposition, and, that, treating, these, words, as, separate, problems, in, isolation, from, judgment, was, merely, a, linguistic, muddle, a, variant, of, redundancy, theory, is, the, disquotational, theory, which, uses, a, modified, form, of, the, logician, alfred, tarski, s, schema, proponents, observe, that, to, say, that, p, is, true, is, to, assert, p, a, version, of, this, theory, was, defended, by, c, j, f, williams, in, his, book, what, is, truth, yet, another, version, of, deflationism, is, the, prosentential, theory, of, truth, first, developed, by, dorothy, grover, joseph, camp, and, nuel, belnap, as, an, elaboration, of, ramsey, s, claims, they, argue, that, utterances, such, as, that, s, true, when, said, in, response, to, e, g, it, s, raining, are, prosentences, expressions, that, merely, repeat, the, content, of, other, expressions, in, the, same, way, that, it, means, the, same, as, my, dog, in, the, statement, my, dog, was, hungry, so, i, fed, it, that, s, true, is, supposed, to, mean, the, same, as, it, s, raining, when, the, former, is, said, in, reply, to, the, latter, as, noted, above, proponents, of, these, ideas, do, not, necessarily, follow, ramsey, in, asserting, that, truth, is, not, a, property, rather, they, can, be, understood, to, say, that, for, instance, the, assertion, p, may, well, involve, a, substantial, truth, it, is, only, the, redundancy, involved, in, statements, such, as, that, s, true, i, e, a, prosentence, which, is, to, be, minimized, attributed, to, philosopher, p, f, strawson, is, the, performative, theory, of, truth, which, holds, that, to, say, snow, is, white, is, true, is, to, perform, the, speech, act, of, signaling, one, s, agreement, with, the, claim, that, snow, is, white, much, like, nodding, one, s, head, in, agreement, the, idea, that, some, statements, are, more, actions, than, communicative, statements, is, not, as, odd, as, it, may, seem, for, example, when, a, wedding, couple, says, i, do, at, the, appropriate, time, in, a, wedding, they, are, performing, the, act, of, taking, the, other, to, be, their, lawful, wedded, spouse, they, are, not, describing, themselves, as, taking, the, other, but, actually, doing, so, perhaps, the, most, thorough, analysis, of, such, illocutionary, acts, is, j, l, austin, most, notably, in, how, to, do, things, with, words, strawson, holds, that, a, similar, analysis, is, applicable, to, all, speech, acts, not, just, illocutionary, ones, to, say, a, statement, is, true, is, not, to, make, a, statement, about, a, statement, but, rather, to, perform, the, act, of, agreeing, with, accepting, or, endorsing, a, statement, when, one, says, it, s, true, that, it, s, raining, one, asserts, no, more, than, it, s, raining, the, function, of, it, s, true, that, is, to, agree, with, accept, or, endorse, the, statement, that, it, s, raining, philosophical, skepticism, is, generally, any, doubt, of, one, or, more, items, of, knowledge, or, belief, which, ascribe, truth, to, their, assertions, and, propositions, the, primary, target, of, philosophical, skepticism, is, epistemology, but, it, can, be, applied, to, any, domain, such, as, the, supernatural, morality, moral, skepticism, and, religion, skepticism, about, the, existence, of, god, philosophical, skepticism, comes, in, various, forms, radical, forms, of, skepticism, deny, that, knowledge, or, rational, belief, is, possible, and, urge, us, to, suspend, judgment, regarding, ascription, of, truth, on, many, or, all, controversial, matters, more, moderate, forms, of, skepticism, claim, only, that, nothing, can, be, known, with, certainty, or, that, we, can, know, little, or, nothing, about, the, big, questions, in, life, such, as, whether, god, exists, or, whether, there, is, an, afterlife, religious, skepticism, is, doubt, concerning, basic, religious, principles, such, as, immortality, providence, and, revelation, scientific, skepticism, concerns, testing, beliefs, for, reliability, by, subjecting, them, to, systematic, investigation, using, the, scientific, method, to, discover, empirical, evidence, for, them, several, of, the, major, theories, of, truth, hold, that, there, is, a, particular, property, the, having, of, which, makes, a, belief, or, proposition, true, pluralist, theories, of, truth, assert, that, there, may, be, more, than, one, property, that, makes, propositions, true, ethical, propositions, might, be, true, by, virtue, of, coherence, propositions, about, the, physical, world, might, be, true, by, corresponding, to, the, objects, and, properties, they, are, about, some, of, the, pragmatic, theories, such, as, those, by, charles, peirce, and, william, james, included, aspects, of, correspondence, coherence, and, constructivist, theories, crispin, wright, argued, in, his, 1992, book, truth, and, objectivity, that, any, predicate, which, satisfied, certain, platitudes, about, truth, qualified, as, a, truth, predicate, in, some, discourses, wright, argued, the, role, of, the, truth, predicate, might, be, played, by, the, notion, of, superassertibility, michael, lynch, in, a, 2009, book, truth, as, one, and, many, argued, that, we, should, see, truth, as, a, functional, property, capable, of, being, multiply, manifested, in, distinct, properties, like, correspondence, or, coherence, logic, is, concerned, with, the, patterns, in, reason, that, can, help, tell, if, a, proposition, is, true, or, not, logicians, use, formal, languages, to, express, the, truths, they, are, concerned, with, and, as, such, there, is, only, truth, under, some, interpretation, or, truth, within, some, logical, system, a, logical, truth, also, called, an, analytic, truth, or, a, necessary, truth, is, a, statement, that, is, true, in, all, possible, worlds, or, under, all, possible, interpretations, as, contrasted, to, a, fact, also, called, a, synthetic, claim, or, a, contingency, which, is, only, true, in, this, world, as, it, has, historically, unfolded, a, proposition, such, as, if, p, and, q, then, p, is, considered, to, be, a, logical, truth, because, of, the, meaning, of, the, symbols, and, words, in, it, and, not, because, of, any, fact, of, any, particular, world, they, are, such, that, they, could, not, be, untrue, degrees, of, truth, in, logic, may, be, represented, using, two, or, more, discrete, values, as, with, bivalent, logic, or, binary, logic, three, valued, logic, and, other, forms, of, finite, valued, logic, truth, in, logic, can, be, represented, using, numbers, comprising, a, continuous, range, typically, between, 0, and, 1, as, with, fuzzy, logic, and, other, forms, of, infinite, valued, logic, in, general, the, concept, of, representing, truth, using, more, than, two, values, is, known, as, many, valued, logic, there, are, two, main, approaches, to, truth, in, mathematics, they, are, the, model, theory, of, truth, and, the, proof, theory, of, truth, historically, with, the, nineteenth, century, development, of, boolean, algebra, mathematical, models, of, logic, began, to, treat, truth, also, represented, as, t, or, 1, as, an, arbitrary, constant, falsity, is, also, an, arbitrary, constant, which, can, be, represented, as, f, or, 0, in, propositional, logic, these, symbols, can, be, manipulated, according, to, a, set, of, axioms, and, rules, of, inference, often, given, in, the, form, of, truth, tables, in, addition, from, at, least, the, time, of, hilbert, s, program, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, to, the, proof, of, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorems, and, the, development, of, the, church, turing, thesis, in, the, early, part, of, that, century, true, statements, in, mathematics, were, generally, assumed, to, be, those, statements, that, are, provable, in, a, formal, axiomatic, system, the, works, of, kurt, g, del, alan, turing, and, others, shook, this, assumption, with, the, development, of, statements, that, are, true, but, cannot, be, proven, within, the, system, two, examples, of, the, latter, can, be, found, in, hilbert, s, problems, work, on, hilbert, s, 10th, problem, led, in, the, late, twentieth, century, to, the, construction, of, specific, diophantine, equations, for, which, it, is, undecidable, whether, they, have, a, solution, or, even, if, they, do, whether, they, have, a, finite, or, infinite, number, of, solutions, more, fundamentally, hilbert, s, first, problem, was, on, the, continuum, hypothesis, g, del, and, paul, cohen, showed, that, this, hypothesis, cannot, be, proved, or, disproved, using, the, standard, axioms, of, set, theory, in, the, view, of, some, then, it, is, equally, reasonable, to, take, either, the, continuum, hypothesis, or, its, negation, as, a, new, axiom, g, del, thought, that, the, ability, to, perceive, the, truth, of, a, mathematical, or, logical, proposition, is, a, matter, of, intuition, an, ability, he, admitted, could, be, ultimately, beyond, the, scope, of, a, formal, theory, of, logic, or, mathematics, and, perhaps, best, considered, in, the, realm, of, human, comprehension, and, communication, but, he, commented, the, more, i, think, about, language, the, more, it, amazes, me, that, people, ever, understand, each, other, at, all, the, semantic, theory, of, truth, has, as, its, general, case, for, a, given, language, where, p, refers, to, the, sentence, the, sentence, s, name, and, p, is, just, the, sentence, itself, tarski, s, theory, of, truth, named, after, alfred, tarski, was, developed, for, formal, languages, such, as, formal, logic, here, he, restricted, it, in, this, way, no, language, could, contain, its, own, truth, predicate, that, is, the, expression, is, true, could, only, apply, to, sentences, in, some, other, language, the, latter, he, called, an, object, language, the, language, being, talked, about, it, may, in, turn, have, a, truth, predicate, that, can, be, applied, to, sentences, in, still, another, language, the, reason, for, his, restriction, was, that, languages, that, contain, their, own, truth, predicate, will, contain, paradoxical, sentences, such, as, this, sentence, is, not, true, as, a, result, tarski, held, that, the, semantic, theory, could, not, be, applied, to, any, natural, language, such, as, english, because, they, contain, their, own, truth, predicates, donald, davidson, used, it, as, the, foundation, of, his, truth, conditional, semantics, and, linked, it, to, radical, interpretation, in, a, form, of, coherentism, bertrand, russell, is, credited, with, noticing, the, existence, of, such, paradoxes, even, in, the, best, symbolic, formations, of, mathematics, in, his, day, in, particular, the, paradox, that, came, to, be, named, after, him, russell, s, paradox, russell, and, whitehead, attempted, to, solve, these, problems, in, principia, mathematica, by, putting, statements, into, a, hierarchy, of, types, wherein, a, statement, cannot, refer, to, itself, but, only, to, statements, lower, in, the, hierarchy, this, in, turn, led, to, new, orders, of, difficulty, regarding, the, precise, natures, of, types, and, the, structures, of, conceptually, possible, type, systems, that, have, yet, to, be, resolved, to, this, day, kripke, s, theory, of, truth, named, after, saul, kripke, contends, that, a, natural, language, can, in, fact, contain, its, own, truth, predicate, without, giving, rise, to, contradiction, he, showed, how, to, construct, one, as, follows, truth, never, gets, defined, for, sentences, like, this, sentence, is, false, since, it, was, not, in, the, original, subset, and, does, not, predicate, truth, of, any, sentence, in, the, original, or, any, subsequent, set, in, kripke, s, terms, these, are, ungrounded, since, these, sentences, are, never, assigned, either, truth, or, falsehood, even, if, the, process, is, carried, out, infinitely, kripke, s, theory, implies, that, some, sentences, are, neither, true, nor, false, this, contradicts, the, principle, of, bivalence, every, sentence, must, be, either, true, or, false, since, this, principle, is, a, key, premise, in, deriving, the, liar, paradox, the, paradox, is, dissolved, the, proof, sketch, for, g, del, s, first, incompleteness, theorem, shows, self, reference, cannot, be, avoided, naively, since, propositions, about, seemingly, unrelated, objects, can, have, an, informal, self, referential, meaning, in, g, del, s, work, these, objects, are, integer, numbers, and, they, have, an, informal, meaning, regarding, propositions, in, fact, this, idea, manifested, by, the, diagonal, lemma, is, the, basis, for, tarski, s, theorem, that, truth, cannot, be, consistently, defined, it, has, thus, been, claimed, that, kripke, s, system, indeed, leads, to, contradiction, while, its, truth, predicate, is, only, partial, it, does, give, truth, value, true, false, to, propositions, such, as, the, one, built, in, tarski, s, proof, and, is, therefore, inconsistent, while, there, is, still, a, debate, on, whether, tarski, s, proof, can, be, implemented, to, every, similar, partial, truth, system, none, have, been, shown, to, be, consistent, by, acceptable, methods, used, in, mathematical, logic, kripke, s, semantics, are, related, to, the, use, of, topoi, and, other, concepts, from, category, theory, in, the, study, of, mathematical, logic, they, provide, a, choice, of, formal, semantics, for, intuitionistic, logic, the, truth, predicate, p, is, true, has, great, practical, value, in, human, language, allowing, efficient, endorsement, or, impeaching, of, claims, made, by, others, to, emphasize, the, truth, or, falsity, of, a, statement, or, to, enable, various, indirect, gricean, conversational, implications, individuals, or, societies, will, sometime, punish, false, statements, to, deter, falsehoods, the, oldest, surviving, law, text, the, code, of, ur, nammu, lists, penalties, for, false, accusations, of, sorcery, or, adultery, as, well, as, for, committing, perjury, in, court, even, four, year, old, children, can, pass, simple, false, belief, tests, and, successfully, assess, that, another, individual, s, belief, diverges, from, reality, in, a, specific, way, by, adulthood, there, are, strong, implicit, intuitions, about, truth, that, form, a, folk, theory, of, truth, these, intuitions, include, like, many, folk, theories, the, folk, theory, of, truth, is, useful, in, everyday, life, but, upon, deep, analysis, turns, out, to, be, technically, self, contradictory, in, particular, any, formal, system, that, fully, obeys, capture, and, release, semantics, for, truth, also, known, as, the, t, schema, and, that, also, respects, classical, logic, is, provably, inconsistent, and, succumbs, to, the, liar, paradox, or, to, a, similar, contradiction, socrates, plato, s, and, aristotle, s, ideas, about, truth, are, seen, by, some, as, consistent, with, correspondence, theory, in, his, metaphysics, aristotle, stated, to, say, of, what, is, that, it, is, not, or, of, what, is, not, that, it, is, is, false, while, to, say, of, what, is, that, it, is, and, of, what, is, not, that, it, is, not, is, true, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, proceeds, to, say, of, aristotle, aristotle, sounds, much, more, like, a, genuine, correspondence, theorist, in, the, categories, 12b11, 14b14, where, he, talks, of, underlying, things, that, make, statements, true, and, implies, that, these, things, pragmata, are, logically, structured, situations, or, facts, viz, his, sitting, his, not, sitting, most, influential, is, his, claim, in, de, interpretatione, 16a3, that, thoughts, are, likenesses, homoiosis, of, things, although, he, nowhere, defines, truth, in, terms, of, a, thought, s, likeness, to, a, thing, or, fact, it, is, clear, that, such, a, definition, would, fit, well, into, his, overall, philosophy, of, mind, similar, statements, can, also, be, found, in, plato, s, dialogues, cratylus, 385b2, sophist, 263b, some, greek, philosophers, maintained, that, truth, was, either, not, accessible, to, mortals, or, of, greatly, limited, accessibility, forming, early, philosophical, skepticism, among, these, were, xenophanes, democritus, and, pyrrho, the, founder, of, pyrrhonism, who, argued, that, there, was, no, criterion, of, truth, the, epicureans, believed, that, all, sense, perceptions, were, true, and, that, errors, arise, in, how, we, judge, those, perceptions, the, stoics, conceived, truth, as, accessible, from, impressions, via, cognitive, grasping, in, early, islamic, philosophy, avicenna, ibn, sina, defined, truth, in, his, work, kitab, al, shifa, the, book, of, healing, book, i, chapter, 8, as, what, corresponds, in, the, mind, to, what, is, outside, it, avicenna, elaborated, on, his, definition, of, truth, later, in, book, viii, chapter, 6, the, truth, of, a, thing, is, the, property, of, the, being, of, each, thing, which, has, been, established, in, it, this, definition, is, but, a, rendering, of, the, medieval, latin, translation, of, the, work, by, simone, van, riet, a, modern, translation, of, the, original, arabic, text, states, truth, is, also, said, of, the, veridical, belief, in, the, existence, reevaluating, avicenna, and, also, augustine, and, aristotle, thomas, aquinas, stated, in, his, disputed, questions, on, truth, a, natural, thing, being, placed, between, two, intellects, is, called, true, insofar, as, it, conforms, to, either, it, is, said, to, be, true, with, respect, to, its, conformity, with, the, divine, intellect, insofar, as, it, fulfills, the, end, to, which, it, was, ordained, by, the, divine, intellect, with, respect, to, its, conformity, with, a, human, intellect, a, thing, is, said, to, be, true, insofar, as, it, is, such, as, to, cause, a, true, estimate, about, itself, thus, for, aquinas, the, truth, of, the, human, intellect, logical, truth, is, based, on, the, truth, in, things, ontological, truth, following, this, he, wrote, an, elegant, re, statement, of, aristotle, s, view, in, his, summa, i, 16, 1, veritas, est, ad, quatio, intellectus, et, rei, truth, is, the, conformity, of, the, intellect, and, things, aquinas, also, said, that, real, things, participate, in, the, act, of, being, of, the, creator, god, who, is, subsistent, being, intelligence, and, truth, thus, these, beings, possess, the, light, of, intelligibility, and, are, knowable, these, things, beings, reality, are, the, foundation, of, the, truth, that, is, found, in, the, human, mind, when, it, acquires, knowledge, of, things, first, through, the, senses, then, through, the, understanding, and, the, judgement, done, by, reason, for, aquinas, human, intelligence, intus, within, and, legere, to, read, has, the, capability, to, reach, the, essence, and, existence, of, things, because, it, has, a, non, material, spiritual, element, although, some, moral, educational, and, other, elements, might, interfere, with, its, capability, richard, firth, green, examined, the, concept, of, truth, in, the, later, middle, ages, in, his, a, crisis, of, truth, and, concludes, that, roughly, during, the, reign, of, richard, ii, of, england, the, very, meaning, of, the, concept, changes, the, idea, of, the, oath, which, was, so, much, part, and, parcel, of, for, instance, romance, literature, changes, from, a, subjective, concept, to, a, more, objective, one, in, derek, pearsall, s, summary, whereas, truth, the, trouthe, of, sir, gawain, and, the, green, knight, was, first, an, ethical, truth, in, which, truth, is, understood, to, reside, in, persons, in, ricardian, england, it, transforms, into, a, political, truth, in, which, truth, is, understood, to, reside, in, documents, immanuel, kant, endorses, a, definition, of, truth, along, the, lines, of, the, correspondence, theory, of, truth, kant, writes, in, the, critique, of, pure, reason, the, nominal, definition, of, truth, namely, that, it, is, the, agreement, of, cognition, with, its, object, is, here, granted, and, presupposed, he, denies, that, this, correspondence, definition, of, truth, provides, us, with, a, test, or, criterion, to, establish, which, judgements, are, true, he, states, in, his, logic, lectures, truth, it, is, said, consists, in, the, agreement, of, cognition, with, its, object, in, consequence, of, this, mere, nominal, definition, my, cognition, to, count, as, true, is, supposed, to, agree, with, its, object, now, i, can, compare, the, object, with, my, cognition, however, only, by, cognizing, it, hence, my, cognition, is, supposed, to, confirm, itself, which, is, far, short, of, being, sufficient, for, truth, for, since, the, object, is, outside, me, the, cognition, in, me, all, i, can, ever, pass, judgement, on, is, whether, my, cognition, of, the, object, agrees, with, my, cognition, of, the, object, the, ancients, called, such, a, circle, in, explanation, a, diallelon, and, actually, the, logicians, were, always, reproached, with, this, mistake, by, the, sceptics, who, observed, that, with, this, definition, of, truth, it, is, just, as, when, someone, makes, a, statement, before, a, court, and, in, doing, so, appeals, to, a, witness, with, whom, no, one, is, acquainted, but, who, wants, to, establish, his, credibility, by, maintaining, that, the, one, who, called, him, as, witness, is, an, honest, man, the, accusation, was, grounded, too, only, the, solution, of, the, indicated, problem, is, impossible, without, qualification, and, for, every, man, this, passage, makes, use, of, his, distinction, between, nominal, and, real, definitions, a, nominal, definition, explains, the, meaning, of, a, linguistic, expression, a, real, definition, describes, the, essence, of, certain, objects, and, enables, us, to, determine, whether, any, given, item, falls, within, the, definition, kant, holds, that, the, definition, of, truth, is, merely, nominal, and, therefore, we, cannot, employ, it, to, establish, which, judgements, are, true, according, to, kant, the, ancient, skeptics, were, critical, of, the, logicians, for, holding, that, by, means, of, a, merely, nominal, definition, of, truth, they, can, establish, which, judgements, are, true, they, were, trying, to, do, something, that, is, impossible, without, qualification, and, for, every, man, g, w, f, hegel, distanced, his, philosophy, from, empiricism, by, presenting, truth, as, a, self, moving, process, rather, than, a, matter, of, merely, subjective, thoughts, hegel, s, truth, is, analogous, to, organics, in, that, it, is, self, determining, according, to, its, own, inner, logic, truth, is, its, own, self, movement, within, itself, for, arthur, schopenhauer, a, judgment, is, a, combination, or, separation, of, two, or, more, concepts, if, a, judgment, is, to, be, an, expression, of, knowledge, it, must, have, a, sufficient, reason, or, ground, by, which, the, judgment, could, be, called, true, truth, is, the, reference, of, a, judgment, to, something, different, from, itself, which, is, its, sufficient, reason, ground, judgments, can, have, material, formal, transcendental, or, metalogical, truth, a, judgment, has, material, truth, if, its, concepts, are, based, on, intuitive, perceptions, that, are, generated, from, sensations, if, a, judgment, has, its, reason, ground, in, another, judgment, its, truth, is, called, logical, or, formal, if, a, judgment, of, for, example, pure, mathematics, or, pure, science, is, based, on, the, forms, space, time, causality, of, intuitive, empirical, knowledge, then, the, judgment, has, transcendental, truth, when, s, ren, kierkegaard, as, his, character, johannes, climacus, ends, his, writings, my, thesis, was, subjectivity, heartfelt, is, the, truth, he, does, not, advocate, for, subjectivism, in, its, extreme, form, the, theory, that, something, is, true, simply, because, one, believes, it, to, be, so, but, rather, that, the, objective, approach, to, matters, of, personal, truth, cannot, shed, any, light, upon, that, which, is, most, essential, to, a, person, s, life, objective, truths, are, concerned, with, the, facts, of, a, person, s, being, while, subjective, truths, are, concerned, with, a, person, s, way, of, being, kierkegaard, agrees, that, objective, truths, for, the, study, of, subjects, like, mathematics, science, and, history, are, relevant, and, necessary, but, argues, that, objective, truths, do, not, shed, any, light, on, a, person, s, inner, relationship, to, existence, at, best, these, truths, can, only, provide, a, severely, narrowed, perspective, that, has, little, to, do, with, one, s, actual, experience, of, life, while, objective, truths, are, final, and, static, subjective, truths, are, continuing, and, dynamic, the, truth, of, one, s, existence, is, a, living, inward, and, subjective, experience, that, is, always, in, the, process, of, becoming, the, values, morals, and, spiritual, approaches, a, person, adopts, while, not, denying, the, existence, of, objective, truths, of, those, beliefs, can, only, become, truly, known, when, they, have, been, inwardly, appropriated, through, subjective, experience, thus, kierkegaard, criticizes, all, systematic, philosophies, which, attempt, to, know, life, or, the, truth, of, existence, via, theories, and, objective, knowledge, about, reality, as, kierkegaard, claims, human, truth, is, something, that, is, continually, occurring, and, a, human, being, cannot, find, truth, separate, from, the, subjective, experience, of, one, s, own, existing, defined, by, the, values, and, fundamental, essence, that, consist, of, one, s, way, of, life, friedrich, nietzsche, believed, the, search, for, truth, or, the, will, to, truth, was, a, consequence, of, the, will, to, power, of, philosophers, he, thought, that, truth, should, be, used, as, long, as, it, promoted, life, and, the, will, to, power, and, he, thought, untruth, was, better, than, truth, if, it, had, this, life, enhancement, as, a, consequence, as, he, wrote, in, beyond, good, and, evil, the, falseness, of, a, judgment, is, to, us, not, necessarily, an, objection, to, a, judgment, the, question, is, to, what, extent, it, is, life, advancing, life, preserving, species, preserving, perhaps, even, species, breeding, aphorism, 4, he, proposed, the, will, to, power, as, a, truth, only, because, according, to, him, it, was, the, most, life, affirming, and, sincere, perspective, one, could, have, robert, wicks, discusses, nietzsche, s, basic, view, of, truth, as, follows, some, scholars, regard, nietzsche, s, 1873, unpublished, essay, on, truth, and, lies, in, a, nonmoral, sense, ber, wahrheit, und, l, ge, im, au, ermoralischen, sinn, as, a, keystone, in, his, thought, in, this, essay, nietzsche, rejects, the, idea, of, universal, constants, and, claims, that, what, we, call, truth, is, only, a, mobile, army, of, metaphors, metonyms, and, anthropomorphisms, his, view, at, this, time, is, that, arbitrariness, completely, prevails, within, human, experience, concepts, originate, via, the, very, artistic, transference, of, nerve, stimuli, into, images, truth, is, nothing, more, than, the, invention, of, fixed, conventions, for, merely, practical, purposes, especially, those, of, repose, security, and, consistence, separately, nietzsche, suggested, that, an, ancient, metaphysical, belief, in, the, divinity, of, truth, lies, at, the, heart, of, and, has, served, as, the, foundation, for, the, entire, subsequent, western, intellectual, tradition, but, you, will, have, gathered, what, i, am, getting, at, namely, that, it, is, still, a, metaphysical, faith, on, which, our, faith, in, science, rests, that, even, we, knowers, of, today, we, godless, anti, metaphysicians, still, take, our, fire, too, from, the, flame, lit, by, the, thousand, year, old, faith, the, christian, faith, which, was, also, plato, s, faith, that, god, is, truth, that, truth, is, divine, moreover, nietzsche, challenges, the, notion, of, objective, truth, arguing, that, truths, are, human, creations, and, serve, practical, purposes, he, wrote, truths, are, illusions, about, which, one, has, forgotten, that, this, is, what, they, are, he, argues, that, truth, is, a, human, invention, arising, from, the, artistic, transference, of, nerve, stimuli, into, images, serving, practical, purposes, like, repose, security, and, consistency, formed, through, metaphorical, and, rhetorical, devices, shaped, by, societal, conventions, and, forgotten, origins, what, then, is, truth, a, mobile, army, of, metaphors, metonyms, and, anthropomorphisms, in, short, a, sum, of, human, relations, which, have, been, enhanced, transposed, and, embellished, poetically, and, rhetorically, nietzsche, argues, that, truth, is, always, filtered, through, individual, perspectives, and, shaped, by, various, interests, and, biases, in, on, the, genealogy, of, morality, he, asserts, there, are, no, facts, only, interpretations, he, suggests, that, truth, is, subject, to, constant, reinterpretation, and, change, influenced, by, shifting, cultural, and, historical, contexts, as, he, writes, in, thus, spoke, zarathustra, that, i, say, unto, you, one, must, still, have, chaos, in, oneself, to, be, able, to, give, birth, to, a, dancing, star, in, the, same, book, zarathustra, proclaims, truths, are, illusions, which, we, have, forgotten, are, illusions, they, are, metaphors, that, have, become, worn, out, and, have, been, drained, of, sensuous, force, coins, which, have, lost, their, embossing, and, are, now, considered, as, metal, and, no, longer, as, coins, other, philosophers, take, this, common, meaning, to, be, secondary, and, derivative, according, to, martin, heidegger, the, original, meaning, and, essence, of, truth, in, ancient, greece, was, unconcealment, or, the, revealing, or, bringing, of, what, was, previously, hidden, into, the, open, as, indicated, by, the, original, greek, term, for, truth, aletheia, on, this, view, the, conception, of, truth, as, correctness, is, a, later, derivation, from, the, concept, s, original, essence, a, development, heidegger, traces, to, the, latin, term, veritas, owing, to, the, primacy, of, ontology, in, heidegger, s, philosophy, he, considered, this, truth, to, lie, within, being, itself, and, already, in, being, and, time, 1927, had, identified, truth, with, being, truth, or, the, truth, of, being, and, partially, with, the, kantian, thing, in, itself, in, an, epistemology, essentially, concerning, a, mode, of, dasein, in, being, and, nothingness, 1943, partially, following, heidegger, jean, paul, sartre, identified, our, knowledge, of, the, truth, as, a, relation, between, the, in, itself, and, for, itself, of, being, yet, simultaneously, closely, connected, in, this, vein, to, the, data, available, to, the, material, personhood, in, the, body, of, an, individual, in, their, interaction, with, the, world, and, others, with, sartre, s, description, that, the, world, is, human, allowing, him, to, postulate, all, truth, as, strictly, understood, by, self, consciousness, as, self, consciousness, of, something, a, view, also, preceded, by, henri, bergson, in, time, and, free, will, 1889, the, reading, of, which, sartre, had, credited, for, his, interest, in, philosophy, this, first, existentialist, theory, more, fully, fleshed, out, in, sartre, s, essay, truth, and, existence, 1948, which, already, demonstrates, a, more, radical, departure, from, heidegger, in, its, emphasis, on, the, primacy, of, the, idea, already, formulated, in, being, and, nothingness, of, existence, as, preceding, essence, in, its, role, in, the, formulation, of, truth, has, nevertheless, been, critically, examined, as, idealist, rather, than, materialist, in, its, departure, from, more, traditional, idealist, epistemologies, such, as, those, of, ancient, greek, philosophy, in, plato, and, aristotle, and, staying, as, does, heidegger, with, kant, later, in, the, search, for, a, method, 1957, in, which, sartre, used, a, unification, of, existentialism, and, marxism, that, he, would, later, formulate, in, the, critique, of, dialectical, reason, 1960, sartre, with, his, growing, emphasis, on, the, hegelian, totalisation, of, historicity, posited, a, conception, of, truth, still, defined, by, its, process, of, relation, to, a, container, giving, it, material, meaning, but, with, specfiic, reference, to, a, role, in, this, broader, totalisation, for, subjectivity, is, neither, everything, nor, nothing, it, represents, a, moment, in, the, objective, process, that, in, which, externality, is, internalised, and, this, moment, is, perpetually, eliminated, only, to, be, perpetually, reborn, for, us, truth, is, something, which, becomes, it, has, and, will, have, become, it, is, a, totalisation, which, is, forever, being, totalised, particular, facts, do, not, signify, anything, they, are, neither, true, nor, false, so, long, as, they, are, not, related, through, the, mediation, of, various, partial, totalities, to, the, totalisation, in, process, sartre, describes, this, as, a, realistic, epistemology, developed, out, of, marx, s, ideas, but, with, such, a, development, only, possible, in, an, existentialist, light, as, with, the, theme, of, the, whole, work, in, an, early, segment, of, the, lengthy, two, volume, critique, of, 1960, sartre, continued, to, describe, truth, as, a, totalising, truth, of, history, to, be, interpreted, by, a, marxist, historian, whilst, his, break, with, heidegger, s, epistemological, ideas, is, finalised, in, the, description, of, a, seemingly, antinomous, dualism, of, being, and, truth, as, the, essence, of, a, truly, marxist, epistemology, the, well, regarded, french, philosopher, albert, camus, wrote, in, his, famous, essay, the, myth, of, sisyphus, 1942, that, there, are, truths, but, no, truth, in, fundamental, agreement, with, nietzsche, s, perspectivism, and, favourably, cites, kierkergaad, in, posing, that, no, truth, is, absolute, or, can, render, satisfactory, an, existence, that, is, impossible, in, itself, later, in, the, rebel, 1951, he, declared, akin, to, sartre, that, the, very, lowest, form, of, truth, is, the, truth, of, history, but, describes, this, in, the, context, of, its, abuse, and, like, kierkergaad, in, the, concluding, unscientific, postscript, he, criticizes, hegel, in, holding, a, historical, attitude, which, consists, of, saying, this, is, truth, which, appears, to, us, however, to, be, error, but, which, is, true, precisely, because, it, happens, to, be, error, as, for, proof, it, is, not, i, but, history, at, its, conclusion, that, will, furnish, it, alfred, north, whitehead, a, british, mathematician, who, became, an, american, philosopher, said, there, are, no, whole, truths, all, truths, are, half, truths, it, is, trying, to, treat, them, as, whole, truths, that, plays, the, devil, the, logical, progression, or, connection, of, this, line, of, thought, is, to, conclude, that, truth, can, lie, since, half, truths, are, deceptive, and, may, lead, to, a, false, conclusion, pragmatists, like, c, s, peirce, take, truth, to, have, some, manner, of, essential, relation, to, human, practices, for, inquiring, into, and, discovering, truth, with, peirce, himself, holding, that, truth, is, what, human, inquiry, would, find, out, on, a, matter, if, our, practice, of, inquiry, were, taken, as, far, as, it, could, profitably, go, the, opinion, which, is, fated, to, be, ultimately, agreed, to, by, all, who, investigate, is, what, we, mean, by, the, truth, according, to, kitaro, nishida, knowledge, of, things, in, the, world, begins, with, the, differentiation, of, unitary, consciousness, into, knower, and, known, and, ends, with, self, and, things, becoming, one, again, such, unification, takes, form, not, only, in, knowing, but, in, the, valuing, of, truth, that, directs, knowing, the, willing, that, directs, action, and, the, feeling, or, emotive, reach, that, directs, sensing, erich, fromm, finds, that, trying, to, discuss, truth, as, absolute, truth, is, sterile, and, that, emphasis, ought, to, be, placed, on, optimal, truth, he, considers, truth, as, stemming, from, the, survival, imperative, of, grasping, one, s, environment, physically, and, intellectually, whereby, young, children, instinctively, seek, truth, so, as, to, orient, themselves, in, a, strange, and, powerful, world, the, accuracy, of, their, perceived, approximation, of, the, truth, will, therefore, have, direct, consequences, on, their, ability, to, deal, with, their, environment, fromm, can, be, understood, to, define, truth, as, a, functional, approximation, of, reality, his, vision, of, optimal, truth, is, described, partly, in, man, for, himself, an, inquiry, into, the, psychology, of, ethics, 1947, from, which, excerpts, are, included, below, truth, says, michel, foucault, is, problematic, when, any, attempt, is, made, to, see, truth, as, an, objective, quality, he, prefers, not, to, use, the, term, truth, itself, but, regimes, of, truth, in, his, historical, investigations, he, found, truth, to, be, something, that, was, itself, a, part, of, or, embedded, within, a, given, power, structure, thus, foucault, s, view, shares, much, in, common, with, the, concepts, of, nietzsche, truth, for, foucault, is, also, something, that, shifts, through, various, episteme, throughout, history, jean, baudrillard, considered, truth, to, be, largely, simulated, that, is, pretending, to, have, something, as, opposed, to, dissimulation, pretending, to, not, have, something, he, took, his, cue, from, iconoclasts, whom, he, claims, knew, that, images, of, god, demonstrated, that, god, did, not, exist, baudrillard, wrote, in, precession, of, the, simulacra, some, examples, of, simulacra, that, baudrillard, cited, were, that, prisons, simulate, the, truth, that, society, is, free, scandals, e, g, watergate, simulate, that, corruption, is, corrected, disney, simulates, that, the, u, s, itself, is, an, adult, place, though, such, examples, seem, extreme, such, extremity, is, an, important, part, of, baudrillard, s, theory, for, a, less, extreme, example, movies, usually, end, with, the, bad, being, punished, humiliated, or, otherwise, failing, thus, affirming, for, viewers, the, concept, that, the, good, end, happily, and, the, bad, unhappily, a, narrative, which, implies, that, the, status, quo, and, established, power, structures, are, largely, legitimate, truthmaker, theory, is, the, branch, of, metaphysics, that, explores, the, relationships, between, what, is, true, and, what, exists, it, is, different, from, substantive, theories, of, truth, in, the, sense, that, it, does, not, aim, at, giving, a, definition, of, what, truth, is, instead, it, has, the, goal, of, determining, how, truth, depends, on, being, in, hinduism, truth, is, defined, as, unchangeable, that, which, has, no, distortion, that, which, is, beyond, distinctions, of, time, space, and, person, that, which, pervades, the, universe, in, all, its, constancy, the, human, body, therefore, is, not, completely, true, as, it, changes, with, time, for, example, there, are, many, references, properties, and, explanations, of, truth, by, hindu, sages, that, explain, varied, facets, of, truth, such, as, the, national, motto, of, india, satyameva, jayate, truth, alone, triumphs, as, well, as, satyam, muktaye, truth, liberates, satya, is, parahit, artham, va, unmanaso, yatha, rthatvam, satyam, satya, is, the, benevolent, use, of, words, and, the, mind, for, the, welfare, of, others, or, in, other, words,

tradition, the, notion, of, truth, is, often, divided, into, the, two, truths, doctrine, which, consists, of, relative, or, conventional, truth, and, ultimate, truth, the, former, refers, to, truth, that, is, based, on, common, understanding, among, ordinary, people, and, is, accepted, as, a, practical, basis, for, communication, of, higher, truths, ultimate, truth, necessarily, transcends, logic, in, the, sphere, of, ordinary, experience, and, recognizes, such, phenomena, as, illusory, m, dhyamaka, philosophy, asserts, that, any, doctrine, can, be, analyzed, with, both, divisions, of,
