rastafari, sometimes, called, rastafarianism, is, an, abrahamic, religion, that, developed, in, jamaica, during, the, 1930s, it, is, classified, as, both, a, new, religious, movement, and, a, social, movement, by, scholars, of, religion, there, is, no, central, authority, in, control, of, the, movement, and, much, diversity, exists, among, practitioners, who, are, known, as, rastafari, rastafarians, or, rastas, rastafari, beliefs, are, based, on, a, specific, interpretation, of, the, bible, central, to, the, religion, is, a, monotheistic, belief, in, a, single, god, referred, to, as, jah, who, is, deemed, to, partially, reside, within, each, individual, rastas, accord, key, importance, to, haile, selassie, emperor, of, ethiopia, between, 1930, and, 1974, many, regard, him, as, the, second, coming, of, jesus, and, jah, incarnate, while, others, see, him, as, a, human, prophet, who, fully, recognised, jah, s, presence, in, every, individual, rastafari, is, afrocentric, and, focuses, attention, on, the, african, diaspora, which, it, believes, is, oppressed, within, western, society, or, babylon, many, rastas, call, for, this, diaspora, s, resettlement, in, africa, a, continent, they, consider, the, promised, land, or, zion, some, practitioners, extend, these, views, into, black, supremacism, rastas, refer, to, their, practices, as, livity, communal, meetings, are, known, as, groundations, and, are, typified, by, music, chanting, discussions, and, the, smoking, of, cannabis, the, latter, regarded, as, a, sacrament, with, beneficial, properties, rastas, emphasise, what, they, regard, as, living, naturally, adhering, to, ital, dietary, requirements, wearing, their, hair, in, dreadlocks, and, following, patriarchal, gender, roles, rastafari, originated, among, impoverished, and, socially, disenfranchised, afro, jamaican, communities, in, 1930s, jamaica, its, afrocentric, ideology, was, largely, a, reaction, against, jamaica, s, then, dominant, british, colonial, culture, it, was, influenced, by, both, ethiopianism, and, the, back, to, africa, movement, promoted, by, black, nationalist, figures, such, as, marcus, garvey, the, religion, developed, after, several, protestant, christian, clergymen, most, notably, leonard, howell, proclaimed, that, haile, selassie, s, crowning, as, emperor, of, ethiopia, in, 1930, fulfilled, a, biblical, prophecy, by, the, 1950s, rastafari, s, countercultural, stance, had, brought, the, movement, into, conflict, with, wider, jamaican, society, including, violent, clashes, with, law, enforcement, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, it, gained, increased, respectability, within, jamaica, and, greater, visibility, abroad, through, the, popularity, of, rastafari, inspired, reggae, musicians, most, notably, bob, marley, enthusiasm, for, rastafari, declined, in, the, 1980s, following, the, deaths, of, haile, selassie, and, marley, but, the, movement, survived, and, has, a, presence, in, many, parts, of, the, world, the, rastafari, movement, is, decentralised, and, organised, on, a, largely, sectarian, basis, there, are, several, denominations, or, mansions, of, rastafari, the, most, prominent, of, which, are, the, nyahbinghi, bobo, ashanti, and, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, each, offering, a, different, interpretation, of, rastafari, belief, there, are, an, estimated, 700, 000, to, one, million, rastafari, across, the, world, the, largest, population, is, in, jamaica, although, small, communities, can, be, found, in, most, of, the, world, s, major, population, centres, most, rastafari, are, of, black, african, descent, and, some, groups, accept, only, black, members, rastafari, has, been, described, as, a, religion, meeting, many, of, the, proposed, definitions, for, what, constitutes, a, religion, and, is, legally, recognised, as, such, in, various, countries, some, scholars, of, religion, have, labelled, it, an, abrahamic, religion, others, have, categorised, rastafari, as, a, new, religious, movement, while, some, scholars, have, also, classified, it, as, a, sect, a, cult, and, a, revitalisation, movement, having, arisen, in, jamaica, it, has, been, described, as, an, afro, jamaican, religion, and, more, broadly, an, afro, caribbean, religion, although, rastafari, focuses, on, africa, as, a, source, of, identity, it, is, a, product, of, creolisation, processes, in, the, americas, described, by, the, hispanic, studies, scholars, margarite, fern, ndez, olmos, and, lizabeth, paravisini, gebert, as, a, creole, religion, rooted, in, african, european, and, indian, practices, and, beliefs, the, scholar, ennis, b, edmonds, also, suggested, that, rastafari, was, emerging, as, a, world, religion, not, because, of, the, number, of, its, adherents, but, because, of, its, global, spread, many, rastas, nevertheless, reject, descriptions, of, rastafari, as, a, religion, instead, referring, to, it, as, a, way, of, life, a, philosophy, or, a, spirituality, emphasising, its, political, stance, particularly, in, support, of, african, nationalism, and, pan, africanism, some, academics, have, characterised, rastafari, as, a, political, movement, a, politico, religious, movement, or, a, protest, movement, it, has, alternatively, been, labelled, a, social, movement, or, more, specifically, as, a, new, social, movement, and, a, cultural, movement, many, rastas, or, rastafarians, as, practitioners, are, known, nevertheless, dislike, the, labelling, of, rastafari, as, a, movement, in, 1989, a, british, industrial, tribunal, concluded, that, for, the, purposes, of, the, race, relations, act, 1976, rastafarians, could, be, considered, an, ethnic, group, because, they, have, a, long, shared, heritage, which, distinguished, them, from, other, groups, their, own, cultural, traditions, a, common, language, and, a, common, religion, rastafari, has, continuously, changed, and, developed, with, significant, doctrinal, variation, existing, among, practitioners, depending, on, the, group, to, which, they, belong, it, is, not, a, unified, movement, and, there, has, never, been, a, single, leader, followed, by, all, rastafari, it, is, thus, difficult, to, make, broad, generalisations, about, the, movement, without, obscuring, the, complexities, within, it, the, scholar, of, religion, darren, j, n, middleton, suggested, that, it, was, appropriate, to, speak, of, a, plethora, of, rasta, spiritualities, rather, than, a, single, phenomenon, the, term, rastafari, derives, from, ras, tafari, makonnen, the, pre, regnal, title, of, haile, selassie, the, former, ethiopian, emperor, who, occupies, a, central, role, in, rasta, belief, the, term, ras, means, a, duke, or, prince, in, the, ethiopian, semitic, languages, tafari, makonnen, was, selassie, s, personal, name, it, is, unknown, why, the, early, rastas, adopted, this, form, of, haile, selassie, s, name, as, the, basis, of, the, term, for, their, religion, as, well, as, being, the, religion, s, name, rastafari, is, also, used, for, the, religion, s, practitioners, themselves, many, commentators, including, some, academic, sources, and, some, practitioners, refer, to, the, movement, as, rastafarianism, however, the, term, is, disparaged, by, many, rastafari, who, believe, that, the, use, of, ism, implies, religious, doctrine, and, institutional, organisation, things, they, wish, to, avoid, rastas, refer, to, the, totality, of, their, religion, s, ideas, and, beliefs, as, rastalogy, edmonds, described, rastafari, as, having, a, fairly, cohesive, worldview, however, the, scholar, ernest, cashmore, thought, that, its, beliefs, were, fluid, and, open, to, interpretation, within, the, movement, attempts, to, summarise, rastafari, belief, have, never, been, accorded, the, status, of, a, catechism, or, creed, rastas, place, great, emphasis, on, the, idea, that, personal, experience, and, intuitive, understanding, should, be, used, to, determine, the, truth, or, validity, of, a, particular, belief, or, practice, no, rasta, therefore, has, the, authority, to, declare, which, beliefs, and, practices, are, orthodox, and, which, are, heterodox, the, conviction, that, rastafari, has, no, dogma, is, so, strong, that, it, has, itself, become, something, of, a, dogma, according, to, the, sociologist, of, religion, peter, b, clarke, rastafari, is, deeply, influenced, by, judeo, christian, religion, and, shares, many, commonalities, with, christianity, the, scholar, michael, barnett, observed, that, its, theology, is, essentially, judeo, christian, representing, an, afrocentralized, blend, of, christianity, and, judaism, some, followers, openly, describe, themselves, as, christians, rastafari, accords, the, bible, a, central, place, in, its, belief, system, regarding, it, as, a, holy, book, and, adopts, a, literalist, interpretation, of, its, contents, according, to, the, anthropologist, stephen, d, glazier, rasta, approaches, to, the, bible, result, in, the, religion, adopting, an, outlook, very, similar, to, that, of, some, forms, of, protestantism, rastas, regard, the, bible, as, an, authentic, account, of, early, black, african, history, and, of, their, place, as, god, s, favoured, people, they, believe, the, bible, to, be, key, to, understanding, both, the, past, and, the, present, and, for, predicting, the, future, while, also, regarding, it, as, a, source, book, from, which, they, can, form, and, justify, their, beliefs, and, practices, rastas, commonly, perceive, the, final, book, of, the, bible, the, book, of, revelation, as, the, most, important, part, because, they, see, its, contents, as, having, particular, significance, for, the, world, s, present, situation, contrary, to, scholarly, understandings, of, how, the, bible, was, compiled, rastas, commonly, believe, it, was, originally, written, on, stone, in, the, ethiopian, language, of, amharic, they, also, believe, that, the, bible, s, true, meaning, has, been, warped, both, through, mistranslation, into, other, languages, and, by, deliberate, manipulation, by, those, seeking, to, deny, black, africans, their, history, they, also, regard, it, as, cryptographic, meaning, that, it, has, many, hidden, meanings, they, believe, that, its, true, teachings, can, be, revealed, through, intuition, and, meditation, on, the, book, within, which, allows, them, to, commune, with, god, because, of, what, they, regard, as, the, corruption, of, the, bible, rastas, also, turn, to, other, sources, that, they, believe, shed, light, on, black, african, history, common, texts, used, for, this, purpose, include, leonard, howell, s, 1935, work, the, promised, key, robert, athlyi, rogers, 1924, book, holy, piby, and, fitz, balintine, pettersburg, s, 1920s, work, the, royal, parchment, scroll, of, black, supremacy, many, rastas, also, treat, the, kebra, nagast, a, 14th, century, ethiopian, text, as, a, source, through, which, to, interpret, the, bible, rastas, are, monotheists, worshipping, a, singular, god, whom, they, call, jah, the, term, jah, is, a, shortened, version, of, jehovah, the, name, of, god, in, english, translations, of, the, old, testament, rastafari, holds, strongly, to, the, immanence, of, this, divinity, as, well, as, regarding, jah, as, a, deity, rastas, believe, that, jah, is, inherent, within, each, individual, this, belief, is, reflected, in, the, aphorism, often, cited, by, rastas, that, god, is, man, and, man, is, god, and, rastas, speak, of, knowing, jah, rather, than, simply, believing, in, him, in, seeking, to, narrow, the, distance, between, humanity, and, divinity, rastafari, embraces, mysticism, jesus, is, an, important, figure, in, rastafari, however, practitioners, reject, the, traditional, christian, view, of, jesus, particularly, the, depiction, of, him, as, a, white, european, believing, that, this, is, a, perversion, of, the, truth, they, believe, that, jesus, was, a, black, african, and, that, the, white, jesus, was, a, false, god, many, rastas, regard, christianity, as, the, creation, of, the, white, man, they, treat, it, with, suspicion, out, of, the, view, that, the, oppressors, white, europeans, and, the, oppressed, black, africans, cannot, share, the, same, god, many, rastas, take, the, view, that, the, god, worshipped, by, most, white, christians, is, actually, the, devil, and, a, recurring, claim, among, rastas, is, that, the, pope, is, satan, or, the, antichrist, rastas, therefore, often, view, christian, preachers, as, deceivers, and, regard, christianity, as, being, guilty, of, furthering, the, oppression, of, the, african, diaspora, frequently, referring, to, it, as, having, perpetrated, mental, enslavement, from, its, origins, rastafari, was, intrinsically, linked, with, haile, selassie, the, emperor, of, ethiopia, from, 1930, to, 1974, he, remains, the, central, figure, in, rastafari, ideology, and, although, all, rastas, hold, him, in, esteem, precise, interpretations, of, his, identity, differ, understandings, of, how, haile, selassie, relates, to, jesus, vary, among, rastas, many, although, not, all, believe, that, the, ethiopian, monarch, was, the, second, coming, of, jesus, legitimising, this, by, reference, to, their, interpretation, of, the, nineteenth, chapter, of, the, book, of, revelation, by, viewing, haile, selassie, as, jesus, these, rastas, also, regard, him, as, the, messiah, prophesied, in, the, old, testament, the, manifestation, of, god, in, human, form, and, the, living, god, some, perceive, him, as, part, of, a, trinity, alongside, god, as, creator, and, the, holy, spirit, the, latter, referred, to, as, the, breath, within, the, temple, rastas, who, view, haile, selassie, as, jesus, argue, that, both, were, descendants, from, the, royal, line, of, the, biblical, king, david, while, rastas, also, emphasise, the, fact, that, the, makonnen, dynasty, of, which, haile, selassie, was, a, member, claimed, descent, from, the, biblical, figures, solomon, and, the, queen, of, sheba, other, rastas, see, selassie, as, embodying, jesus, teachings, and, essence, but, reject, the, idea, that, he, was, the, literal, reincarnation, of, jesus, members, of, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, denomination, for, instance, reject, the, idea, that, selassie, was, the, second, coming, arguing, that, this, event, has, yet, to, occur, from, this, perspective, selassie, is, perceived, as, a, messenger, or, emissary, of, god, rather, than, a, manifestation, of, god, himself, rastas, holding, to, this, view, sometimes, regard, the, deification, of, haile, selassie, as, na, ve, or, ignorant, in, some, cases, thinking, it, as, dangerous, to, worship, a, human, being, as, god, there, are, various, rastas, who, went, from, believing, that, haile, selassie, was, both, god, incarnate, and, the, second, coming, of, jesus, to, seeing, him, as, something, distinct, on, being, crowned, haile, selassie, was, given, the, title, of, king, of, kings, and, lord, of, lords, conquering, lion, of, the, tribe, of, judah, rastas, use, this, title, for, haile, selassie, alongside, others, such, as, almighty, god, judge, and, avenger, king, alpha, and, queen, omega, returned, messiah, elect, of, god, and, elect, of, himself, rastas, also, view, haile, selassie, as, a, symbol, of, their, positive, affirmation, of, africa, as, a, source, of, spiritual, and, cultural, heritage, while, he, was, emperor, many, jamaican, rastas, professed, the, belief, that, haile, selassie, would, never, die, the, 1974, overthrow, of, haile, selassie, by, the, military, derg, and, his, subsequent, death, in, 1975, resulted, in, a, crisis, of, faith, for, many, practitioners, some, left, the, movement, altogether, others, remained, and, developed, new, strategies, for, dealing, with, the, news, some, rastas, believed, that, selassie, did, not, really, die, and, that, claims, to, the, contrary, were, western, misinformation, to, bolster, their, argument, they, pointed, to, the, fact, that, no, corpse, had, been, produced, in, reality, haile, selassie, s, body, had, been, buried, beneath, his, palace, remaining, undiscovered, there, until, 1992, another, perspective, within, rastafari, acknowledged, that, haile, selassie, s, body, had, perished, but, claimed, that, his, inner, essence, survived, as, a, spiritual, force, a, third, response, within, the, rastafari, community, was, that, selassie, s, death, was, inconsequential, as, he, had, only, been, a, personification, of, jah, rather, than, jah, himself, during, his, life, selassie, described, himself, as, a, devout, christian, in, a, 1967, interview, selassie, was, asked, about, the, rasta, belief, that, he, was, the, second, coming, of, jesus, to, which, he, responded, i, have, heard, of, this, idea, i, also, met, certain, rastafarians, i, told, them, clearly, that, i, am, a, man, that, i, am, mortal, and, that, i, will, be, replaced, by, the, oncoming, generation, and, that, they, should, never, make, a, mistake, in, assuming, or, pretending, that, a, human, being, is, emanated, from, a, deity, his, grandson, ermias, sahle, selassie, has, said, that, there, is, no, doubt, that, haile, selassie, did, not, encourage, the, rastafari, movement, critics, of, rastafari, have, used, this, as, evidence, that, rasta, theological, beliefs, are, incorrect, although, some, rastas, take, selassie, s, denials, as, evidence, that, he, was, indeed, the, incarnation, of, god, based, on, their, reading, of, the, gospel, of, luke, according, to, clarke, rastafari, is, concerned, above, all, else, with, black, consciousness, with, rediscovering, the, identity, personal, and, racial, of, black, people, the, rastafari, movement, began, among, afro, jamaicans, who, wanted, to, reject, the, british, colonial, culture, that, dominated, jamaica, and, replace, it, with, a, new, identity, based, on, a, reclamation, of, their, african, heritage, its, emphasis, is, on, the, purging, of, any, belief, in, the, inferiority, of, black, people, and, the, superiority, of, white, people, from, the, minds, of, its, followers, rastafari, is, therefore, afrocentric, equating, blackness, with, the, african, continent, and, endorsing, a, form, of, pan, africanism, practitioners, of, rastafari, identify, themselves, with, the, ancient, israelites, god, s, chosen, people, in, the, old, testament, and, believe, that, black, africans, broadly, or, rastas, more, specifically, are, either, the, descendants, or, the, reincarnations, of, this, ancient, people, this, is, similar, to, beliefs, in, judaism, although, many, rastas, believe, that, contemporary, jews, status, as, the, descendants, of, the, ancient, israelites, is, a, false, claim, rastas, typically, believe, that, black, africans, are, god, s, chosen, people, meaning, that, they, made, a, covenant, with, him, and, thus, have, a, special, responsibility, rastafari, espouses, the, view, that, this, the, true, identity, of, black, africans, has, been, lost, and, needs, to, be, reclaimed, there, is, no, uniform, rasta, view, on, race, black, supremacy, was, a, theme, early, in, the, movement, with, the, belief, in, the, existence, of, a, distinctly, black, african, race, that, is, superior, to, other, racial, groups, while, some, still, hold, this, belief, non, black, rastas, are, now, widely, accepted, in, the, movement, rastafari, s, history, has, opened, the, religion, to, accusations, of, racism, cashmore, noted, that, there, was, an, implicit, potential, for, racism, in, rasta, beliefs, but, he, also, noted, that, racism, was, not, intrinsic, to, the, religion, some, rastas, have, acknowledged, that, there, is, racism, in, the, movement, primarily, against, europeans, and, asians, some, rasta, sects, reject, the, notion, that, a, white, european, can, ever, be, a, legitimate, rasta, other, rasta, sects, believe, that, an, african, identity, is, not, inherently, linked, to, black, skin, but, rather, is, about, whether, an, individual, displays, an, african, attitude, or, spirit, rastafari, teaches, that, the, black, african, diaspora, are, exiles, living, in, babylon, a, term, which, it, applies, to, western, society, for, rastas, european, colonialism, and, global, capitalism, are, regarded, as, manifestations, of, babylon, while, police, and, soldiers, are, viewed, as, its, agents, the, term, babylon, is, adopted, because, of, its, biblical, associations, in, the, old, testament, babylon, is, the, mesopotamian, city, where, the, israelites, were, held, captive, exiled, from, their, homeland, between, 597, and, 586, bce, rastas, compare, the, exile, of, the, israelites, in, mesopotamia, to, the, exile, of, the, african, diaspora, outside, africa, in, the, new, testament, babylon, is, used, as, a, euphemism, for, the, roman, empire, which, was, regarded, as, acting, in, a, destructive, manner, that, was, akin, to, the, way, in, which, the, ancient, babylonians, acted, rastas, perceive, the, exile, of, the, black, african, diaspora, in, babylon, as, an, experience, of, great, suffering, with, the, term, suffering, having, a, significant, place, in, rasta, discourse, rastas, view, babylon, as, being, responsible, for, both, the, atlantic, slave, trade, which, removed, enslaved, africans, from, their, continent, and, the, ongoing, poverty, which, plagues, the, african, diaspora, rastas, turn, to, biblical, scripture, to, explain, the, atlantic, slave, trade, believing, that, the, enslavement, exile, and, exploitation, of, black, africans, was, punishment, for, failing, to, live, up, to, their, status, as, jah, s, chosen, people, many, rastas, adopting, a, pan, africanist, ethos, have, criticised, the, division, of, africa, into, nation, states, regarding, this, as, a, babylonian, development, and, are, often, hostile, to, capitalist, resource, extraction, from, the, continent, rastas, seek, to, delegitimise, and, destroy, babylon, something, often, conveyed, in, the, rasta, aphorism, chant, down, babylon, rastas, often, expect, the, white, dominated, society, to, dismiss, their, beliefs, as, false, and, when, this, happens, they, see, it, as, confirmation, of, the, correctness, of, their, faith, rastas, view, zion, as, an, ideal, to, which, they, aspire, as, with, babylon, this, term, comes, from, the, bible, where, it, refers, to, an, idealised, jerusalem, rastas, use, zion, either, for, ethiopia, specifically, or, for, africa, more, broadly, the, latter, having, an, almost, mythological, identity, in, rasta, discourse, many, rastas, use, the, term, ethiopia, as, a, synonym, for, africa, thus, rastas, in, ghana, for, instance, described, themselves, as, already, living, within, ethiopia, other, rastas, apply, the, term, zion, to, jamaica, or, they, use, it, to, describe, a, state, of, mind, in, portraying, africa, as, their, promised, land, rastas, reflect, their, desire, to, escape, what, they, perceive, as, the, domination, and, degradation, that, they, experience, in, babylon, during, the, first, three, decades, of, the, rastafari, movement, it, placed, strong, emphasis, on, the, need, for, the, african, diaspora, to, be, repatriated, to, africa, to, this, end, various, rastas, lobbied, the, jamaican, government, and, united, nations, to, oversee, this, resettlement, process, other, rastas, organised, their, own, transportation, to, the, african, continent, critics, of, the, movement, have, argued, that, the, migration, of, the, entire, african, diaspora, to, africa, is, implausible, particularly, as, no, african, country, would, welcome, this, by, the, movement, s, fourth, decade, the, desire, for, physical, repatriation, to, africa, had, declined, among, rastas, a, change, influenced, by, observation, of, the, 1983, 1985, famine, in, ethiopia, rather, many, rastas, saw, the, idea, of, returning, to, africa, in, a, metaphorical, sense, entailing, the, restoration, of, their, pride, and, self, confidence, as, people, of, black, african, descent, the, term, liberation, before, repatriation, began, to, be, used, within, the, movement, some, rastas, seek, to, transform, western, society, so, that, they, may, more, comfortably, live, within, it, rather, than, seeking, to, move, to, africa, there, are, nevertheless, many, rastas, who, continue, to, emphasise, the, need, for, physical, resettlement, of, the, african, diaspora, in, africa, rastafari, is, a, millenarian, movement, espousing, the, idea, that, the, present, age, will, come, to, an, apocalyptic, end, many, practitioners, believe, that, on, this, day, of, judgment, babylon, will, be, overthrown, with, rastas, being, the, chosen, few, who, survive, the, upheaval, with, babylon, destroyed, rastas, believe, that, humanity, will, be, ushered, into, a, new, age, this, is, conceived, as, being, a, millennium, of, peace, justice, and, happiness, in, which, the, righteous, shall, live, in, africa, now, a, paradise, in, the, 1980s, many, rastas, believed, that, the, day, of, judgment, would, happen, around, the, year, 2000, a, view, then, common, in, the, rasta, community, was, that, the, world, s, white, people, would, wipe, themselves, out, through, nuclear, war, with, black, africans, then, ruling, the, world, something, that, they, argued, was, prophesied, in, the, book, of, daniel, rastas, do, not, believe, that, there, is, a, specific, afterlife, to, which, individuals, go, following, bodily, death, they, believe, in, the, possibility, of, eternal, life, and, that, only, those, who, shun, righteousness, will, actually, die, the, scholar, of, religion, leonard, e, barrett, observed, some, jamaican, rastas, who, believed, that, those, practitioners, who, did, die, had, not, been, faithful, to, jah, he, suggested, that, this, attitude, stemmed, from, the, large, numbers, of, young, people, that, were, then, members, of, the, movement, and, who, had, thus, seen, only, few, rastas, die, another, rasta, view, is, that, those, who, are, righteous, will, undergo, reincarnation, with, an, individual, s, identity, remaining, throughout, each, of, their, incarnations, in, keeping, with, their, views, on, death, rastas, eschew, celebrating, physical, death, and, often, avoid, funerals, also, repudiating, the, practice, of, ancestor, veneration, that, is, common, among, traditional, african, religions, most, rastas, share, a, pair, of, fundamental, moral, principles, known, as, the, two, great, commandments, love, of, god, and, love, of, neighbour, many, rastas, believe, that, to, determine, whether, they, should, undertake, a, certain, act, or, not, they, should, consult, the, presence, of, jah, within, themselves, rastafari, promotes, the, idea, of, living, naturally, in, accordance, with, what, rastas, regard, as, nature, s, laws, it, endorses, the, idea, that, africa, is, the, natural, abode, of, black, africans, a, continent, where, they, can, live, according, to, african, culture, and, tradition, and, be, themselves, on, a, physical, emotional, and, intellectual, level, practitioners, believe, that, westerners, and, babylon, have, detached, themselves, from, nature, through, technological, development, and, thus, have, become, debilitated, slothful, and, decadent, some, rastas, express, the, view, that, they, should, adhere, to, what, they, regard, as, african, laws, rather, than, the, laws, of, babylon, thus, defending, their, involvement, in, certain, acts, which, may, be, illegal, in, the, countries, that, they, are, living, in, in, emphasising, this, afrocentric, approach, rastafari, expresses, overtones, of, black, nationalism, the, scholar, maureen, warner, lewis, observed, that, rastafari, combined, a, radical, even, revolutionary, stance, on, socio, political, issues, particularly, regarding, race, with, a, profoundly, traditional, approach, to, philosophical, conservatism, on, other, religious, issues, rastas, typically, look, critically, upon, modern, capitalism, with, its, consumerism, and, materialism, they, favour, small, scale, pre, industrial, and, agricultural, societies, some, rastas, have, promoted, activism, as, a, means, of, achieving, socio, political, reform, while, others, believe, in, awaiting, change, that, will, be, brought, about, through, divine, intervention, in, human, affairs, in, jamaica, rastas, typically, do, not, vote, derogatorily, dismissing, politics, as, politricks, and, rarely, involve, themselves, in, political, parties, or, unions, the, rasta, tendency, to, believe, that, socio, political, change, is, inevitable, opens, the, religion, up, to, the, criticism, from, the, political, left, that, it, encourages, adherents, to, do, little, or, nothing, to, alter, the, status, quo, other, rastas, do, engage, in, political, activism, the, ghanaian, rasta, singer, songwriter, rocky, dawuni, for, instance, was, involved, in, campaigns, promoting, democratic, elections, while, in, grenada, many, rastas, joined, the, people, s, revolutionary, government, formed, in, 1979, rastafari, promotes, what, it, regards, as, the, restoration, of, black, manhood, believing, that, men, in, the, african, diaspora, have, been, emasculated, by, babylon, it, espouses, patriarchal, principles, including, the, idea, that, women, should, submit, to, male, leadership, external, observers, including, scholars, such, as, cashmore, and, edmonds, have, claimed, that, rastafari, accords, women, an, inferior, position, to, men, rastafari, women, usually, accept, this, subordinate, position, and, regard, it, as, their, duty, to, obey, their, men, the, academic, maureen, rowe, suggested, that, women, were, willing, to, join, the, religion, despite, its, restrictions, because, they, valued, the, life, of, structure, and, discipline, it, provided, rasta, discourse, often, presents, women, as, morally, weak, and, susceptible, to, deception, by, evil, and, claims, that, they, are, impure, while, menstruating, rastas, legitimise, these, gender, roles, by, citing, biblical, passages, particularly, those, in, the, book, of, leviticus, and, in, the, writings, of, paul, the, apostle, rasta, women, usually, wear, clothing, that, covers, their, head, and, hides, their, body, contours, trousers, are, usually, avoided, with, long, skirts, preferred, women, are, expected, to, cover, their, head, while, praying, and, in, some, rasta, groups, this, is, expected, of, them, whenever, in, public, rasta, discourse, insists, this, female, dress, code, is, necessary, to, prevent, women, from, attracting, men, and, presents, it, as, an, antidote, to, the, sexual, objectification, of, women, in, babylon, rasta, men, are, permitted, to, wear, whatever, they, choose, although, men, and, women, took, part, alongside, each, other, in, early, rasta, rituals, from, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, the, rasta, community, increasingly, encouraged, gender, segregation, for, ceremonies, this, was, legitimised, with, the, explanation, that, women, were, impure, through, menstruation, and, that, their, presence, at, the, ceremonies, would, distract, male, participants, as, it, existed, in, jamaica, rastafari, did, not, promote, monogamy, though, it, is, not, especially, common, rasta, men, are, permitted, to, engage, in, polygamy, while, women, are, expected, to, reserve, their, sexual, activity, for, one, male, partner, marriage, is, not, usually, formalised, through, legal, ceremonies, but, is, a, common, law, affair, although, many, rastas, are, legally, married, rasta, men, refer, to, their, female, partners, as, queens, or, empresses, while, the, males, in, these, relationships, are, known, as, kingmen, rastafari, places, great, importance, on, family, life, and, the, raising, of, children, with, reproduction, being, encouraged, the, religion, emphasises, the, place, of, men, in, child, rearing, associating, this, with, the, recovery, of, african, manhood, women, often, work, sometimes, while, the, man, raises, the, children, at, home, rastafari, typically, rejects, feminism, although, since, the, 1970s, growing, numbers, of, rasta, women, have, called, for, greater, gender, equity, in, the, movement, the, scholar, terisa, e, turner, for, instance, encountered, kenyan, feminists, who, were, appropriating, rastafari, content, to, suit, their, political, agenda, some, rasta, women, have, challenged, gender, norms, by, wearing, their, hair, uncovered, in, public, and, donning, trousers, rastafari, regards, procreation, as, the, purpose, of, sex, and, thus, oral, and, anal, sex, are, usually, forbidden, both, contraception, and, abortion, are, usually, censured, and, a, common, claim, in, rasta, discourse, is, that, these, were, inventions, of, babylon, to, decrease, the, black, african, birth, rate, rastas, typically, express, hostile, attitudes, to, homosexuality, regarding, homosexuals, as, evil, and, unnatural, this, attitude, derives, from, references, to, same, sex, sexual, activity, in, the, bible, homosexual, rastas, probably, conceal, their, sexual, orientation, because, of, these, attitudes, rastas, typically, see, the, growing, acceptance, of, birth, control, and, homosexuality, in, western, society, as, evidence, of, the, degeneration, of, babylon, as, it, approaches, its, apocalyptic, end, rastas, refer, to, their, cultural, and, religious, practices, as, livity, rastafari, does, not, place, emphasis, on, hierarchical, structures, it, has, no, professional, priesthood, with, rastas, believing, that, there, is, no, need, for, a, priest, to, act, as, mediator, between, the, worshipper, and, jah, it, nevertheless, has, elders, an, honorific, title, bestowed, upon, those, with, a, good, reputation, among, the, community, although, respected, figures, they, do, not, necessarily, have, administrative, functions, or, responsibilities, when, they, do, oversee, ritual, meetings, they, are, often, responsible, for, helping, to, interpret, current, events, in, terms, of, biblical, scripture, elders, often, communicate, with, each, other, through, a, network, to, plan, movement, events, and, form, strategies, the, term, grounding, is, used, among, rastas, to, refer, to, the, establishment, of, relationships, between, like, minded, practitioners, groundings, often, take, place, in, a, commune, or, yard, and, are, presided, over, by, an, elder, the, elder, is, charged, with, keeping, discipline, and, can, ban, individuals, from, attending, the, number, of, participants, can, range, from, a, handful, to, several, hundred, activities, that, take, place, at, groundings, include, the, playing, of, drums, chanting, the, singing, of, hymns, and, the, recitation, of, poetry, cannabis, known, as, ganja, is, often, smoked, most, groundings, contain, only, men, although, some, rasta, women, have, established, their, own, all, female, grounding, circles, one, of, the, central, activities, at, groundings, is, reasoning, this, is, a, discussion, among, assembled, rastas, about, the, religion, s, principles, and, their, relevance, to, current, events, these, discussions, are, supposed, to, be, non, combative, although, attendees, can, point, out, the, fallacies, in, any, arguments, presented, those, assembled, inform, each, other, about, the, revelations, that, they, have, received, through, meditation, and, dream, each, contributor, is, supposed, to, push, the, boundaries, of, understanding, until, the, entire, group, has, gained, greater, insight, into, the, topic, under, discussion, in, meeting, together, with, like, minded, individuals, reasoning, helps, rastas, to, reassure, one, another, of, the, correctness, of, their, beliefs, rastafari, meetings, are, opened, and, closed, with, prayers, these, involve, supplication, of, jah, the, supplication, for, the, hungry, sick, and, infants, and, calls, for, the, destruction, of, the, rastas, enemies, and, then, close, with, statements, of, adoration, princes, shall, come, out, of, egypt, ethiopia, shall, stretch, forth, her, hand, unto, god, oh, thou, god, of, ethiopia, thou, god, of, divine, majesty, thy, spirit, come, within, our, hearts, to, dwell, in, the, parts, of, righteousness, that, the, hungry, be, fed, the, sick, nourished, the, aged, protected, and, the, infant, cared, for, teach, us, love, and, loyalty, as, it, is, in, zion, opening, passage, of, a, common, rasta, prayer, the, largest, groundings, were, known, as, groundations, or, grounations, in, the, 1950s, although, they, were, subsequently, re, termed, nyabinghi, issemblies, the, term, nyabinghi, is, adopted, from, the, name, of, a, mythical, african, queen, nyabinghi, issemblies, are, often, held, on, dates, associated, with, ethiopia, and, haile, selassie, these, include, ethiopian, christmas, 7, january, the, day, on, which, haile, selassie, visited, jamaica, 21, april, selassie, s, birthday, 23, july, ethiopian, new, year, 11, september, and, selassie, s, coronation, day, 2, november, some, rastas, also, organise, nyabinghi, issemblies, to, mark, jamaica, s, emancipation, day, 1, august, and, marcus, garvey, s, birthday, 17, august, nyabinghi, issemblies, typically, take, place, in, rural, areas, being, situated, in, the, open, air, or, in, temporary, structures, known, as, temples, or, tabernacles, specifically, constructed, for, the, purpose, any, elder, seeking, to, sponsor, a, nyabinghi, issembly, must, have, approval, from, other, elders, and, requires, the, adequate, resources, to, organise, such, an, event, the, assembly, usually, lasts, between, three, and, seven, days, during, the, daytime, attendees, engage, in, food, preparation, ganja, smoking, and, reasoning, while, at, night, they, focus, on, drumming, and, dancing, around, bonfires, nyabinghi, issemblies, often, attract, rastas, from, a, wide, area, including, from, different, countries, they, establish, and, maintain, a, sense, of, solidarity, among, the, rasta, community, and, cultivate, a, feeling, of, collective, belonging, unlike, in, many, other, religions, rites, of, passage, play, no, role, in, rastafari, on, death, various, rastas, have, been, given, christian, funerals, by, their, relatives, as, there, are, no, established, rasta, funeral, rites, the, principal, ritual, of, rastafari, is, the, smoking, of, ganja, also, known, as, marijuana, or, cannabis, among, the, names, that, rastas, give, to, the, plant, are, callie, iley, the, herb, the, holy, herb, the, grass, and, the, weed, cannabis, is, usually, smoked, during, groundings, although, some, practitioners, also, smoke, it, informally, in, other, contexts, some, rastas, smoke, it, almost, all, of, the, time, something, other, practitioners, regard, as, excessive, and, many, practitioners, also, ingest, cannabis, in, a, tea, as, a, spice, in, cooking, and, as, an, ingredient, in, medicine, however, not, all, rastas, use, ganja, abstainers, explain, that, they, have, already, achieved, a, higher, level, of, consciousness, and, thus, do, not, require, it, in, rastafari, cannabis, is, considered, a, sacrament, rastas, argue, that, the, use, of, ganja, is, promoted, in, the, bible, specifically, in, genesis, psalms, and, revelation, they, regard, it, as, having, healing, properties, eulogise, it, for, inducing, feelings, of, peace, and, love, and, claim, that, it, cultivates, a, form, of, personal, introspection, that, allows, the, smokers, to, discover, their, inner, divinity, some, rastas, believe, that, cannabis, smoke, serves, as, an, incense, that, counteracts, immoral, practices, in, society, rastas, typically, smoke, cannabis, in, the, form, of, a, large, hand, rolled, cigarette, known, as, a, spliff, this, is, often, rolled, together, while, a, prayer, is, offered, to, jah, the, spliff, is, lit, and, smoked, only, when, the, prayer, is, completed, at, other, times, cannabis, is, smoked, in, a, water, pipe, referred, to, as, a, chalice, styles, include, kutchies, chillums, and, steamers, the, pipe, is, passed, in, a, counter, clockwise, direction, around, the, assembled, circle, of, rastas, there, are, various, options, that, might, explain, how, cannabis, smoking, came, to, be, part, of, rastafari, by, the, 8th, century, arab, traders, had, introduced, cannabis, to, central, and, southern, africa, in, the, 19th, century, enslaved, bakongo, people, arrived, in, jamaica, where, they, established, the, religion, of, kumina, in, kumina, cannabis, was, smoked, during, religious, ceremonies, in, the, belief, that, it, facilitated, possession, by, ancestral, spirits, the, religion, was, largely, practiced, in, south, east, jamaica, s, saint, thomas, parish, where, a, prominent, early, rasta, leonard, howell, lived, while, he, was, developing, many, of, rastafari, s, beliefs, and, practices, it, may, have, been, through, kumina, that, cannabis, became, part, of, rastafari, a, second, possible, source, was, the, use, of, cannabis, in, hindu, rituals, hindu, migrants, arrived, in, jamaica, as, indentured, servants, from, british, india, between, 1834, and, 1917, and, brought, cannabis, with, them, a, jamaican, hindu, priest, laloo, was, one, of, howell, s, spiritual, advisors, and, may, have, influenced, his, adoption, of, ganja, the, adoption, of, cannabis, may, also, have, been, influenced, by, the, widespread, medicinal, and, recreational, use, of, cannabis, among, afro, jamaicans, in, the, early, 20th, century, early, rastafarians, may, have, taken, an, element, of, jamaican, culture, which, they, associated, with, their, peasant, past, and, the, rejection, of, capitalism, and, sanctified, it, by, according, it, biblical, correlates, in, many, countries, including, jamaica, cannabis, is, illegal, and, by, using, it, rastas, protest, the, rules, and, regulations, of, babylon, in, the, united, states, for, example, thousands, of, practitioners, have, been, arrested, because, of, their, possession, of, the, drug, rastas, have, also, advocated, for, the, legalisation, of, cannabis, in, those, jurisdictions, where, it, is, illegal, in, 2015, jamaica, decriminalized, personal, possession, of, marijuana, up, to, two, ounces, and, legalized, it, for, medicinal, and, scientific, purposes, in, 2019, barbados, legalised, rastafari, use, of, cannabis, within, religious, settings, and, pledged, 60, acres, 24, ha, of, land, for, rastafari, to, grow, it, rastafari, music, developed, at, reasoning, sessions, where, drumming, chanting, and, dancing, are, all, present, rasta, music, is, performed, to, praise, and, commune, with, jah, and, to, reaffirm, the, rejection, of, babylon, rastas, believe, that, their, music, has, healing, properties, with, the, ability, to, cure, colds, fevers, and, headaches, many, of, these, songs, are, sung, to, the, tune, of, older, christian, hymns, but, others, are, original, rasta, creations, the, bass, line, of, rasta, music, is, provided, by, the, akete, a, three, drum, set, which, is, accompanied, by, percussion, instruments, like, rattles, and, tambourines, a, syncopated, rhythm, is, then, provided, by, the, fundeh, drum, in, addition, a, bat, drum, improvises, over, the, rhythm, the, different, components, of, the, music, are, regarded, as, displaying, different, symbolism, the, bassline, symbolises, blows, against, babylon, while, the, lighter, beats, denote, hope, for, the, future, as, rastafari, developed, popular, music, became, its, chief, communicative, medium, during, the, 1960s, ska, was, a, popular, musical, style, in, jamaica, and, although, its, protests, against, social, and, political, conditions, were, mild, it, gave, early, expression, to, rasta, socio, political, ideology, particularly, prominent, in, the, connection, between, rastafari, and, ska, were, the, musicians, count, ossie, and, don, drummond, ossie, was, a, drummer, who, believed, that, black, people, needed, to, develop, their, own, style, of, music, he, was, heavily, influenced, by, burru, an, afro, jamaican, drumming, style, ossie, subsequently, popularised, this, new, rastafari, ritual, music, by, playing, at, various, groundings, and, groundations, around, jamaica, with, songs, like, another, moses, and, babylon, gone, reflecting, rasta, influence, rasta, themes, also, appeared, in, drummond, s, work, with, songs, such, as, reincarnation, and, tribute, to, marcus, garvey, 1968, saw, the, development, of, reggae, in, jamaica, a, musical, style, typified, by, slower, heavier, rhythms, than, ska, and, the, increased, use, of, jamaican, patois, like, calypso, reggae, was, a, medium, for, social, commentary, although, it, demonstrated, a, wider, use, of, radical, political, and, rasta, themes, than, were, previously, present, in, jamaican, popular, music, reggae, artists, incorporated, rasta, ritual, rhythms, and, also, adopted, rasta, chants, language, motifs, and, social, critiques, songs, like, the, wailers, african, herbsman, and, peter, tosh, s, legalize, it, referenced, cannabis, use, while, tracks, like, the, melodians, rivers, of, babylon, and, junior, byles, beat, down, babylon, referenced, rasta, beliefs, in, babylon, reggae, gained, widespread, international, popularity, during, the, mid, 1970s, coming, to, be, viewed, by, black, people, in, many, different, countries, as, music, of, the, oppressed, many, rastas, grew, critical, of, reggae, believing, that, it, had, commercialised, their, religion, although, reggae, contains, much, rastafari, symbolism, and, the, two, are, widely, associated, the, connection, is, often, exaggerated, by, non, rastas, most, rastas, do, not, listen, to, reggae, music, and, reggae, has, also, been, utilised, by, other, religious, groups, such, as, protestant, evangelicals, out, of, reggae, came, dub, music, dub, artists, often, employ, rastafari, terminology, even, when, not, rastas, themselves, rastas, typically, regard, words, as, having, an, intrinsic, power, seeking, to, avoid, language, that, contributes, to, servility, self, degradation, and, the, objectification, of, the, person, practitioners, therefore, often, use, their, own, form, of, language, known, commonly, as, dread, talk, iyaric, and, rasta, talk, developed, in, jamaica, during, the, 1940s, this, use, of, language, fosters, group, identity, and, cultivates, particular, values, adherents, believe, that, by, formulating, their, own, language, they, are, launching, an, ideological, attack, on, the, integrity, of, the, english, language, which, they, view, as, a, tool, of, babylon, the, use, of, this, language, helps, rastas, distinguish, and, separate, themselves, from, non, rastas, for, whom, according, to, barrett, rasta, rhetoric, can, be, meaningless, babbling, however, rasta, terms, have, also, filtered, into, wider, jamaican, speech, patterns, rastas, make, wide, use, of, the, pronoun, i, this, denotes, the, rasta, view, that, the, self, is, divine, and, reminds, each, rasta, that, they, are, not, a, slave, and, have, value, worth, and, dignity, as, a, human, being, for, instance, rastas, use, i, in, place, of, me, i, and, i, in, place, of, we, i, ceive, in, place, of, receive, i, sire, in, place, of, desire, i, rate, in, place, of, create, and, i, men, in, place, of, amen, rastas, refer, to, this, process, as, ini, consciousness, or, isciousness, rastas, typically, refer, to, haile, selassie, as, haile, selassie, i, thus, indicating, their, belief, in, his, divinity, rastas, also, typically, believe, that, the, phonetics, of, a, word, should, be, linked, to, its, meaning, for, instance, rastas, often, use, the, word, downpression, in, place, of, oppression, because, oppression, bears, down, on, people, rather, than, lifting, them, up, with, up, being, phonetically, akin, to, opp, similarly, they, often, favour, livicate, over, dedicate, because, ded, is, phonetically, akin, to, the, word, dead, in, the, early, decades, of, the, religion, s, development, rastas, often, said, peace, and, love, as, a, greeting, although, the, use, of, this, declined, as, rastafari, matured, rastas, often, make, use, of, the, colours, red, black, green, and, gold, red, gold, and, green, were, used, in, the, ethiopian, flag, while, prior, to, the, development, of, rastafari, the, jamaican, black, nationalist, activist, marcus, garvey, had, used, red, green, and, black, as, the, colours, for, the, pan, african, flag, representing, his, united, negro, improvement, association, according, to, garvey, the, red, symbolised, the, blood, of, martyrs, the, black, symbolised, the, skin, of, africans, and, the, green, represented, the, vegetation, of, the, land, an, interpretation, endorsed, by, some, rastas, the, colour, gold, is, often, included, alongside, garvey, s, three, colours, it, has, been, adopted, from, the, jamaican, flag, and, is, often, interpreted, as, symbolising, the, minerals, and, raw, materials, which, constitute, africa, s, wealth, rastas, often, paint, these, colours, onto, their, buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and, other, items, or, display, them, on, their, clothing, helping, to, distinguish, rastas, from, non, rastas, and, allowing, adherents, to, recognise, their, co, religionists, as, well, as, being, used, by, rastas, the, colour, set, has, also, been, adopted, by, pan, africanists, more, broadly, who, use, it, to, display, their, identification, with, afrocentricity, for, this, reason, it, was, adopted, on, the, flags, of, many, post, independence, african, states, rastas, often, accompany, the, use, of, these, three, or, four, colours, with, the, image, of, the, lion, of, judah, also, adopted, from, the, ethiopian, flag, and, symbolizing, haile, selassie, rastas, seek, to, produce, food, naturally, eating, what, they, call, ital, or, natural, food, this, is, often, grown, organically, and, locally, most, rastas, adhere, to, the, dietary, laws, outlined, in, the, book, of, leviticus, and, thus, avoid, eating, pork, or, crustaceans, other, rastas, remain, vegetarian, or, vegan, a, practice, stemming, from, their, interpretation, of, leviticus, many, also, avoid, the, addition, of, additives, including, sugar, and, salt, to, their, food, rasta, dietary, practices, have, been, ridiculed, by, non, rastas, in, ghana, for, example, where, food, traditionally, includes, a, high, meat, content, the, rastas, emphasis, on, vegetable, produce, has, led, to, the, joke, that, they, eat, like, sheep, and, goats, in, jamaica, rasta, practitioners, have, commercialised, ital, food, for, instance, by, selling, fruit, juices, prepared, according, to, rasta, custom, rastafarians, typically, avoid, food, produced, by, non, rastas, or, from, unknown, sources, rasta, men, refuse, to, eat, food, prepared, by, a, woman, while, she, is, menstruating, and, some, will, avoid, food, prepared, by, a, woman, at, any, time, rastas, also, generally, avoid, alcohol, cigarettes, and, hard, drugs, such, as, heroin, and, cocaine, presenting, these, substances, as, unnatural, and, dirty, and, contrasting, them, with, cannabis, rastas, also, often, avoid, mainstream, scientific, medicine, and, will, reject, surgery, injections, or, blood, transfusions, instead, they, utilise, herbal, medicine, for, healing, especially, teas, and, poultices, with, cannabis, often, used, as, an, ingredient, rastas, use, their, physical, appearance, as, a, means, of, visually, demarcating, themselves, from, non, rastas, male, practitioners, will, often, grow, long, beards, and, many, rastas, prefer, to, wear, african, styles, of, clothing, such, as, dashikis, rather, than, styles, that, originated, in, western, countries, however, it, is, the, formation, of, hair, into, dreadlocks, that, is, one, of, the, most, recognisable, rasta, symbols, rastas, believe, that, dreadlocks, are, promoted, in, the, bible, specifically, in, the, book, of, numbers, and, regard, them, as, a, symbol, of, strength, linked, to, the, hair, of, the, biblical, figure, of, samson, they, argue, that, their, dreadlocks, mark, a, covenant, that, they, have, made, with, jah, and, reflect, their, commitment, to, the, idea, of, naturalness, they, also, perceive, the, wearing, of, dreads, as, a, symbolic, rejection, of, babylon, and, a, refusal, to, conform, to, its, norms, regarding, grooming, aesthetics, rastas, are, often, critical, of, black, people, who, straighten, their, hair, believing, that, it, is, an, attempt, to, imitate, white, european, hair, and, thus, reflects, alienation, from, a, person, s, african, identity, sometimes, this, dreadlocked, hair, is, then, shaped, and, styled, often, inspired, by, a, lion, s, mane, symbolising, haile, selassie, who, is, regarded, as, the, conquering, lion, of, judah, rastas, differ, on, whether, they, regard, dreadlocks, as, compulsory, for, practicing, the, religion, some, rastas, do, not, wear, their, hair, in, dreadlocks, within, the, religion, they, are, often, termed, cleanface, rastas, with, those, wearing, dreadlocked, hair, often, called, locksmen, some, rastas, have, also, joined, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, the, christian, organisation, to, which, haile, selassie, belonged, and, these, individuals, are, forbidden, from, putting, their, hair, in, dreadlocks, by, the, church, in, reference, to, rasta, hairstyles, rastas, often, refer, to, non, rastas, as, baldheads, or, combsome, while, those, who, are, new, to, rastafari, and, who, have, only, just, started, to, grow, their, hair, into, dreads, are, termed, nubbies, members, of, the, bobo, ashanti, sect, of, rastas, conceal, their, dreadlocks, within, turbans, while, some, rastas, tuck, their, dreads, under, a, rastacap, or, tam, headdress, usually, coloured, green, red, black, and, yellow, dreadlocks, and, rastafari, inspired, clothing, have, also, been, worn, for, aesthetic, reasons, by, non, rastas, for, instance, many, reggae, musicians, who, do, not, adhere, to, the, rastafari, religion, wear, their, hair, in, dreads, from, the, beginning, of, the, rastafari, movement, in, the, 1930s, adherents, typically, grew, beards, and, tall, hair, perhaps, in, imitation, of, haile, selassie, the, wearing, of, hair, as, dreadlocks, then, emerged, as, a, rasta, practice, in, the, 1940s, there, were, debates, within, the, movement, as, to, whether, dreadlocks, should, be, worn, or, not, with, proponents, of, the, style, becoming, dominant, there, are, various, claims, as, to, how, this, practice, was, adopted, one, claim, is, that, it, was, adopted, in, imitation, of, certain, african, nations, such, as, the, maasai, somalis, or, oromo, or, that, it, was, inspired, by, the, hairstyles, worn, by, some, of, those, involved, in, the, anti, colonialist, mau, mau, uprising, in, kenya, an, alternative, explanation, is, that, it, was, inspired, by, the, hairstyles, of, the, hindu, sadhus, the, wearing, of, dreadlocks, has, contributed, to, negative, views, of, rastafari, among, non, rastas, many, of, whom, regard, it, as, wild, and, unattractive, dreadlocks, remain, socially, stigmatised, in, many, societies, in, ghana, for, example, they, are, often, associated, with, the, homeless, and, mentally, ill, with, such, associations, of, marginality, extending, onto, ghanaian, rastas, in, jamaica, during, the, mid, 20th, century, teachers, and, police, officers, used, to, forcibly, cut, off, the, dreads, of, rastas, in, various, countries, rastas, have, since, won, legal, battles, ensuring, their, right, to, wear, dreadlocks, in, 2020, for, instance, the, high, court, of, malawi, ruled, that, all, public, schools, must, allow, their, students, to, wear, dreadlocks, the, decision, to, begin, to, be, enforced, before, the, 30th, of, june, 2023, of, schools, will, be, in, breach, of, the, country, s, constitution, rastafari, developed, out, of, the, legacy, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, in, which, over, ten, million, enslaved, africans, were, transported, to, the, americas, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, under, 700, 000, of, these, slaves, were, settled, in, the, british, colony, of, jamaica, the, british, government, abolished, slavery, in, the, caribbean, island, in, 1834, although, racial, prejudice, remained, prevalent, across, jamaican, society, rastafari, owed, much, to, intellectual, frameworks, arising, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, one, key, influence, on, rastafari, was, christian, revivalism, with, the, great, revival, of, 1860, 61, drawing, many, afro, jamaicans, to, join, churches, increasing, numbers, of, pentecostal, missionaries, from, the, united, states, arrived, in, jamaica, during, the, early, 20th, century, climaxing, in, the, 1920s, further, contributing, significantly, to, rastafari, s, development, were, ethiopianism, and, the, back, to, africa, ethos, both, traditions, with, 18th, century, roots, in, the, 19th, century, there, were, growing, calls, for, the, african, diaspora, located, in, western, europe, and, the, americas, to, be, resettled, in, africa, with, some, of, this, diaspora, establishing, colonies, in, sierra, leone, and, liberia, based, in, liberia, the, black, christian, preacher, edward, wilmot, blyden, began, promoting, african, pride, and, the, preservation, of, african, tradition, customs, and, institutions, also, spreading, throughout, africa, was, ethiopianism, a, movement, that, accorded, special, status, to, the, east, african, nation, of, ethiopia, because, it, was, mentioned, in, various, biblical, passages, for, adherents, of, ethiopianism, ethiopia, was, regarded, as, a, synonym, of, africa, as, a, whole, of, significant, influence, on, rastafari, was, the, jamaican, activist, marcus, garvey, who, spent, much, of, his, adult, life, in, the, us, and, britain, garvey, supported, the, idea, of, global, racial, separatism, and, called, for, part, of, the, african, diaspora, to, relocate, to, africa, his, ideas, faced, opposition, from, civil, rights, activists, like, w, e, b, du, bois, who, supported, racial, integration, and, as, a, mass, movement, garveyism, declined, in, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, a, rumour, later, spread, that, in, 1916, garvey, had, called, on, his, supporters, to, look, to, africa, for, the, crowning, of, a, black, king, this, quote, was, never, verified, however, in, august, 1930, garvey, s, play, coronation, of, an, african, king, was, performed, in, kingston, its, plot, revolved, around, the, crowning, of, the, fictional, prince, cudjoe, of, sudan, although, it, anticipated, the, crowning, of, haile, selassie, later, that, year, rastas, hold, garvey, in, great, esteem, with, many, regarding, him, as, a, prophet, garvey, knew, of, rastafari, but, took, a, largely, negative, view, of, the, religion, he, also, became, a, critic, of, haile, selassie, calling, him, a, great, coward, who, rules, a, country, where, black, men, are, chained, and, flogged, haile, selassie, was, crowned, emperor, of, ethiopia, in, 1930, becoming, the, first, sovereign, monarch, crowned, in, sub, saharan, africa, since, 1891, and, first, christian, one, since, 1889, a, number, of, jamaica, s, christian, clergymen, claimed, that, selassie, s, coronation, was, evidence, that, he, was, the, black, messiah, that, they, believed, was, prophesied, in, the, book, of, revelation, the, book, of, daniel, and, psalms, over, the, following, years, several, street, preachers, most, notably, leonard, howell, archibald, dunkley, robert, hinds, and, joseph, hibbert, began, claiming, that, haile, selassie, was, the, returned, jesus, they, first, did, so, in, kingston, and, soon, the, message, spread, throughout, 1930s, jamaica, especially, among, poor, communities, who, were, hit, particularly, hard, by, the, great, depression, clarke, stated, that, to, all, intents, and, purposes, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, rastafari, movement, howell, has, been, described, as, the, leading, figure, in, the, early, rastafari, movement, he, preached, that, black, africans, were, superior, to, white, europeans, and, that, afro, jamaicans, should, owe, their, allegiance, to, haile, selassie, rather, than, to, king, george, v, the, island, s, colonial, authorities, arrested, him, and, charged, him, with, sedition, in, 1934, resulting, in, a, two, year, imprisonment, following, his, release, howell, established, the, ethiopian, salvation, society, and, in, 1939, established, a, rasta, community, known, as, pinnacle, in, saint, catherine, parish, police, feared, that, howell, was, training, his, followers, for, an, armed, rebellion, and, were, angered, that, it, was, producing, cannabis, for, sale, they, raided, the, community, on, several, occasions, and, howell, was, imprisoned, for, a, further, two, years, upon, his, release, he, returned, to, pinnacle, but, the, police, continued, with, their, raids, and, shut, down, the, community, in, 1954, howell, himself, was, committed, to, a, mental, hospital, in, 1936, italy, invaded, and, occupied, ethiopia, and, haile, selassie, went, into, exile, the, invasion, brought, international, condemnation, and, led, to, growing, sympathy, for, the, ethiopian, cause, in, 1937, selassie, created, the, ethiopian, world, federation, which, established, a, branch, in, jamaica, later, that, decade, in, 1941, allied, forces, drove, the, italians, out, of, ethiopia, and, selassie, returned, to, reclaim, his, throne, many, rastas, interpreted, this, as, the, fulfilment, of, a, prophecy, made, in, the, book, of, revelation, rastafari, s, main, appeal, was, among, the, lower, classes, of, jamaican, society, for, its, first, thirty, years, rastafari, was, in, a, conflictual, relationship, with, the, jamaican, authorities, jamaica, s, rastas, expressed, contempt, for, many, aspects, of, the, island, s, society, viewing, the, government, police, bureaucracy, professional, classes, and, established, churches, as, instruments, of, babylon, relations, between, practitioners, and, the, police, were, strained, with, rastas, often, being, arrested, for, cannabis, possession, during, the, 1950s, the, movement, grew, rapidly, in, jamaica, itself, and, also, spread, to, other, caribbean, islands, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, a, more, militant, brand, of, rastafari, emerged, the, vanguard, of, this, was, the, house, of, youth, black, faith, a, group, whose, members, were, largely, based, in, west, kingston, backlash, against, the, rastas, grew, after, a, practitioner, of, the, religion, allegedly, killed, a, woman, in, 1957, in, march, 1958, the, first, rastafarian, universal, convention, was, held, in, the, settlement, of, back, o, wall, kingston, following, the, event, militant, rastas, unsuccessfully, tried, to, capture, the, city, in, the, name, of, haile, selassie, later, that, year, they, tried, again, in, spanish, town, the, increasing, militancy, of, some, rastas, resulted, in, growing, alarm, about, the, religion, in, jamaica, according, to, cashmore, the, rastas, became, folk, devils, in, jamaican, society, in, 1959, the, self, declared, prophet, and, founder, of, the, african, reform, church, claudius, henry, sold, thousands, of, tickets, to, afro, jamaicans, including, many, rastas, for, passage, on, a, ship, that, he, claimed, would, take, them, to, africa, the, ship, never, arrived, and, henry, was, charged, with, fraud, in, 1960, he, was, sentenced, to, six, years, imprisonment, for, conspiring, to, overthrow, the, government, henry, s, son, was, accused, of, being, part, of, a, paramilitary, cell, and, executed, confirming, public, fears, about, rasta, violence, one, of, the, most, prominent, clashes, between, rastas, and, law, enforcement, was, the, coral, gardens, incident, of, 1963, in, which, an, initial, skirmish, between, police, and, rastas, resulted, in, several, deaths, and, led, to, a, larger, roundup, of, practitioners, clamping, down, on, the, rasta, movement, in, 1964, the, island, s, government, implemented, tougher, laws, surrounding, cannabis, use, at, the, invitation, of, jamaica, s, government, haile, selassie, visited, the, island, for, the, first, time, on, 21, april, 1966, with, thousands, of, rastas, assembled, in, the, crowd, waiting, to, meet, him, at, the, airport, the, event, was, the, high, point, of, their, discipleship, for, many, of, the, religion, s, members, over, the, course, of, the, 1960s, jamaica, s, rasta, community, underwent, a, process, of, routinisation, with, the, late, 1960s, witnessing, the, launch, of, the, first, official, rastafarian, newspaper, the, rastafarian, movement, association, s, rasta, voice, the, decade, also, saw, rastafari, develop, in, increasingly, complex, ways, as, it, did, when, some, rastas, began, to, reinterpret, the, idea, that, salvation, required, a, physical, return, to, africa, instead, interpreting, salvation, as, coming, through, a, process, of, mental, decolonisation, that, embraced, african, approaches, to, life, whereas, its, membership, had, previously, derived, predominantly, from, poorer, sectors, of, society, in, the, 1960s, rastafari, began, attracting, support, from, more, privileged, groups, like, students, and, professional, musicians, the, foremost, group, emphasising, this, approach, was, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, whose, members, came, to, be, known, as, uptown, rastas, among, those, attracted, to, rastafari, in, this, decade, were, middle, class, intellectuals, like, leahcim, semaj, who, called, for, the, religious, community, to, place, greater, emphasis, on, scholarly, social, theory, as, a, method, of, achieving, change, although, some, jamaican, rastas, were, critical, of, him, many, came, under, the, influence, of, the, guyanese, black, nationalist, academic, walter, rodney, who, lectured, to, their, community, in, 1968, before, publishing, his, thoughts, as, the, pamphlet, groundings, like, rodney, many, jamaican, rastas, were, influenced, by, the, u, s, based, black, power, movement, after, black, power, declined, following, the, deaths, of, prominent, exponents, such, as, malcolm, x, michael, x, and, george, jackson, rastafari, filled, the, vacuum, it, left, for, many, black, youth, in, the, mid, 1970s, reggae, s, international, popularity, exploded, the, most, successful, reggae, artist, was, bob, marley, who, according, to, cashmore, more, than, any, other, individual, was, responsible, for, introducing, rastafarian, themes, concepts, and, demands, to, a, truly, universal, audience, reggae, s, popularity, led, to, a, growth, in, pseudo, rastafarians, individuals, who, listened, to, reggae, and, wore, rasta, clothing, but, did, not, share, its, belief, system, many, rastas, were, angered, by, this, believing, it, commercialised, their, religion, through, reggae, rasta, musicians, became, increasingly, important, in, jamaica, s, political, life, during, the, 1970s, to, bolster, his, popularity, with, the, electorate, jamaican, prime, minister, michael, manley, employed, rasta, imagery, and, courted, and, obtained, support, from, marley, and, other, reggae, musicians, manley, described, rastas, as, a, beautiful, and, remarkable, people, and, carried, a, cane, the, rod, of, correction, which, he, claimed, was, a, gift, from, haile, selassie, following, manley, s, example, jamaican, political, parties, increasingly, employed, rasta, language, symbols, and, reggae, references, in, their, campaigns, while, rasta, symbols, became, increasingly, mainstream, in, jamaican, society, this, helped, to, confer, greater, legitimacy, on, rastafari, with, reggae, and, rasta, imagery, being, increasingly, presented, as, a, core, part, of, jamaica, s, cultural, heritage, for, the, growing, tourist, industry, in, the, 1980s, a, rasta, barbara, makeda, blake, hannah, became, a, senator, in, the, jamaican, parliament, enthusiasm, for, rastafari, was, likely, dampened, by, the, death, of, haile, selassie, in, 1975, and, that, of, marley, in, 1981, during, the, 1980s, the, number, of, rastas, in, jamaica, declined, with, pentecostal, and, other, charismatic, christian, groups, proving, more, successful, at, attracting, young, recruits, several, publicly, prominent, rastas, converted, to, christianity, and, two, of, those, who, did, so, judy, mowatt, and, tommy, cowan, maintained, that, marley, had, converted, from, rastafari, to, christianity, in, the, form, of, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, during, his, final, days, the, significance, of, rastafari, messages, in, reggae, also, declined, with, the, growing, popularity, of, dancehall, a, jamaican, musical, genre, that, typically, foregrounded, lyrical, themes, of, hyper, masculinity, violence, and, sexual, activity, rather, than, religious, symbolism, the, mid, 1990s, saw, a, revival, of, rastafari, focused, reggae, associated, with, musicians, like, anthony, b, buju, banton, luciano, sizzla, and, capleton, from, the, 1990s, jamaica, also, witnessed, the, growth, of, organised, political, activity, within, the, rasta, community, seen, for, instance, through, campaigns, for, the, legalisation, of, cannabis, and, the, creation, of, political, parties, like, the, jamaican, alliance, movement, and, the, imperial, ethiopian, world, federation, incorporated, political, party, none, of, which, attained, more, than, minimal, electoral, support, in, 1995, the, rastafari, centralization, organization, was, established, in, jamaica, as, an, attempt, to, organise, the, rastafari, community, rastafari, is, not, a, homogeneous, movement, and, has, no, single, administrative, structure, nor, any, single, leader, a, majority, of, rastas, avoid, centralised, and, hierarchical, structures, because, they, do, not, want, to, replicate, the, structures, of, babylon, and, because, their, religion, s, ultra, individualistic, ethos, places, emphasis, on, inner, divinity, the, structure, of, most, rastafari, groups, is, less, like, that, of, christian, denominations, and, is, instead, akin, to, the, cellular, structure, of, other, african, diasporic, traditions, like, haitian, vodou, cuban, santer, a, and, jamaica, s, revival, zion, since, the, 1970s, there, have, been, attempts, to, unify, all, rastas, namely, through, the, establishment, of, the, rastafari, movement, association, which, sought, political, mobilisation, in, 1982, the, first, international, assembly, of, rastafari, groups, took, place, in, toronto, canada, this, and, subsequent, international, conferences, assemblies, and, workshops, have, helped, to, cement, global, networks, and, cultivate, an, international, community, of, rastas, sub, divisions, of, rastafari, are, often, referred, to, as, houses, or, mansions, in, keeping, with, a, passage, from, the, gospel, of, john, 14, 2, as, translated, in, the, king, james, bible, jesus, states, in, my, father, s, house, are, many, mansions, the, three, most, prominent, branches, are, the, house, of, nyabinghi, the, bobo, ashanti, and, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, although, other, important, groups, include, the, church, of, haile, selassie, i, inc, and, the, fulfilled, rastafari, by, fragmenting, into, different, houses, without, any, single, leader, rastafari, became, more, resilient, amid, opposition, from, jamaica, s, government, during, the, early, decades, of, the, movement, probably, the, largest, rastafari, group, the, house, of, nyabinghi, is, an, aggregate, of, more, traditional, and, militant, rastas, who, seek, to, retain, the, movement, close, to, the, way, in, which, it, existed, during, the, 1940s, they, stress, the, idea, that, haile, selassie, was, jah, and, the, reincarnation, of, jesus, the, wearing, of, dreadlocks, is, regarded, as, indispensable, and, patriarchal, gender, roles, are, strongly, emphasised, while, according, to, cashmore, they, are, vehemently, anti, white, nyabinghi, rastas, refuse, to, compromise, with, babylon, and, are, often, critical, of, reggae, musicians, like, marley, whom, they, regard, as, having, collaborated, with, the, commercial, music, industry, the, bobo, ashanti, sect, was, founded, in, jamaica, by, emanuel, charles, edwards, through, the, establishment, of, his, ethiopia, africa, black, international, congress, eabic, in, 1958, the, group, established, a, commune, in, bull, bay, where, they, were, led, by, edwards, until, his, death, in, 1994, the, group, hold, to, a, highly, rigid, ethos, edwards, advocated, the, idea, of, a, new, trinity, with, haile, selassie, as, the, living, god, himself, as, the, christ, and, garvey, as, the, prophet, male, members, are, divided, into, two, categories, the, priests, who, conduct, religious, services, and, the, prophets, who, take, part, in, reasoning, sessions, it, places, greater, restrictions, on, women, than, most, other, forms, of, rastafari, women, are, regarded, as, impure, because, of, menstruation, and, childbirth, and, so, are, not, permitted, to, cook, for, men, the, group, teaches, that, black, africans, are, god, s, chosen, people, and, are, superior, to, white, europeans, with, members, often, refusing, to, associate, with, white, people, bobo, ashanti, rastas, are, recognisable, by, their, long, flowing, robes, and, turbans, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, group, was, founded, in, 1968, in, kingston, by, vernon, carrington, he, proclaimed, himself, the, reincarnation, of, the, old, testament, prophet, gad, and, his, followers, call, him, prophet, gad, brother, gad, or, gadman, it, is, commonly, regarded, as, the, most, liberal, form, of, rastafari, and, the, closest, to, christianity, practitioners, are, often, dubbed, christian, rastas, because, they, believe, jesus, is, the, only, saviour, haile, selassie, is, accorded, importance, but, is, not, viewed, as, the, second, coming, of, jesus, the, group, divides, its, members, into, twelve, groups, according, to, which, hebrew, calendar, month, they, were, born, in, each, month, is, associated, with, a, particular, colour, body, part, and, mental, function, maintaining, dreadlocks, and, an, ital, diet, are, considered, commendable, but, not, essential, while, adherents, are, called, upon, to, read, a, chapter, of, the, bible, each, day, membership, is, open, to, individuals, of, any, racial, background, the, twelve, tribes, peaked, in, popularity, during, the, 1970s, when, it, attracted, artists, musicians, and, many, middle, class, followers, marley, among, them, resulting, in, the, terms, middle, class, rastas, and, uptown, rastas, being, applied, to, members, of, the, group, carrington, died, in, 2005, since, which, time, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, have, been, led, by, an, executive, council, as, of, 2010, it, was, recorded, as, being, the, largest, of, the, centralised, rasta, groups, it, remains, headquartered, in, kingston, although, it, has, followers, outside, jamaica, the, group, was, responsible, for, establishing, the, rasta, community, in, shashamane, ethiopia, the, church, of, haile, selassie, inc, was, founded, by, abuna, foxe, and, operated, much, like, a,

example, set, forth, by, haile, selassie, the, wearing, of, dreadlocks, and, the, adherence, to, an, ital, diet, are, considered, issues, up, to, the, individual, born, in, the, ghettos, of, kingston, jamaica, the, rastafarian, movement, has, captured, the, imagination, of, thousands, of, black, youth, and, some, white, youth, throughout, jamaica, the, caribbean, britain, france, and, other, countries, in, western, europe, and, north, america, it, is, also, to, be, found, in, smaller, numbers, in, parts, of, africa, for, example, in, ethiopia, ghana, and, senegal, and, in, australia, and, new, zealand, particularly, among, the, maori, sociologist, of, religion, peter, b, clarke, 1986, as, of, 2012, there, were, an, estimated, 700, 000, to, 1, 000, 000, rastas, worldwide, they, can, be, found, in, many, different, regions, including, most, of, the, world, s, major, population, centres, rastafari, s, influence, on, wider, society, has, been, more, substantial, than, its, numerical, size, particularly, in, fostering, a, racial, political, and, cultural, consciousness, among, the, african, diaspora, and, africans, themselves, men, dominate, rastafari, in, its, early, years, most, of, its, followers, were, men, and, the, women, who, did, adhere, to, it, tended, to, remain, in, the, background, this, picture, of, rastafari, s, demographics, has, been, confirmed, by, ethnographic, studies, conducted, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, the, rasta, message, resonates, with, many, people, who, feel, marginalised, and, alienated, by, the, values, and,
