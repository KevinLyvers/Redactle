the, talmud, t, l, m, d, m, d, t, l, hebrew, romanized, talm, lit, teaching, is, after, the, hebrew, bible, the, central, text, of, rabbinic, judaism, and, the, primary, source, of, jewish, religious, law, halakha, and, jewish, theology, until, the, advent, of, modernity, in, nearly, all, jewish, communities, the, talmud, was, the, centerpiece, of, jewish, cultural, life, and, was, foundational, to, all, jewish, thought, and, aspirations, serving, also, as, the, guide, for, the, daily, life, of, jews, the, term, talmud, normally, refers, to, the, collection, of, writings, named, specifically, the, babylonian, talmud, talmud, bavli, compiled, in, the, 5th, century, by, rav, ashi, and, ravina, ii, there, is, also, an, earlier, collection, known, as, the, jerusalem, talmud, talmud, yerushalmi, it, may, also, traditionally, be, called, shas, a, hebrew, abbreviation, of, shisha, sedarim, or, the, six, orders, of, the, mishnah, the, talmud, has, two, components, the, mishnah, c, 200, ce, a, written, compendium, of, the, oral, torah, and, the, gemara, c, 500, ce, an, elucidation, of, the, mishnah, and, related, tannaitic, writings, that, often, ventures, onto, other, subjects, and, expounds, broadly, on, the, hebrew, bible, the, term, talmud, may, refer, to, either, the, gemara, alone, or, the, mishnah, and, gemara, together, talmudic, traditions, emerged, within, a, literary, period, that, can, be, bracketed, between, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, in, 70, ce, until, the, arab, conquest, in, the, early, seventh, century, the, entire, talmud, consists, of, 63, tractates, and, in, the, standard, print, called, the, vilna, shas, there, are, 2, 711, double, sided, folios, it, is, written, in, mishnaic, hebrew, and, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, and, contains, the, teachings, and, opinions, of, thousands, of, rabbis, on, a, variety, of, subjects, including, halakha, jewish, ethics, philosophy, customs, history, and, folklore, and, many, other, topics, the, talmud, is, the, basis, for, all, codes, of, jewish, law, and, is, widely, quoted, in, rabbinic, literature, talmud, translates, as, instruction, learning, from, the, semitic, root, lmd, meaning, teach, study, originally, jewish, scholarship, was, oral, and, transferred, from, one, generation, to, the, next, rabbis, expounded, and, debated, the, torah, the, written, torah, expressed, in, the, hebrew, bible, and, discussed, the, tanakh, without, the, benefit, of, written, works, other, than, the, biblical, books, themselves, though, some, may, have, made, private, notes, megillot, setarim, for, example, of, court, decisions, this, situation, changed, drastically, due, to, the, roman, destruction, of, the, jewish, commonwealth, and, the, second, temple, in, the, year, 70, and, the, consequent, upheaval, of, jewish, social, and, legal, norms, as, the, rabbis, were, required, to, face, a, new, reality, mainly, judaism, without, a, temple, to, serve, as, the, center, of, teaching, and, study, and, total, roman, control, over, judaea, without, at, least, partial, autonomy, there, was, a, flurry, of, legal, discourse, and, the, old, system, of, oral, scholarship, could, not, be, maintained, it, is, during, this, period, that, rabbinic, discourse, began, to, be, recorded, in, writing, the, process, of, gemara, proceeded, in, what, were, then, the, two, major, centers, of, jewish, scholarship, galilee, and, babylonia, correspondingly, two, bodies, of, analysis, developed, and, two, works, of, talmud, were, created, the, older, compilation, is, called, the, jerusalem, talmud, or, the, talmud, yerushalmi, it, was, compiled, in, the, 4th, century, in, galilee, the, babylonian, talmud, was, compiled, about, the, year, 500, although, it, continued, to, be, edited, later, the, word, talmud, when, used, without, qualification, usually, refers, to, the, babylonian, talmud, while, the, editors, of, jerusalem, talmud, and, babylonian, talmud, each, mention, the, other, community, most, scholars, believe, these, documents, were, written, independently, louis, jacobs, writes, if, the, editors, of, either, had, had, access, to, an, actual, text, of, the, other, it, is, inconceivable, that, they, would, not, have, mentioned, this, here, the, argument, from, silence, is, very, convincing, the, jerusalem, talmud, also, known, as, the, talmuda, de, eretz, yisrael, talmud, of, the, land, of, israel, or, palestinian, talmud, was, one, of, the, two, compilations, of, jewish, religious, teachings, and, commentary, that, was, transmitted, orally, for, centuries, prior, to, its, compilation, by, jewish, scholars, in, the, land, of, israel, it, is, a, compilation, of, teachings, of, the, schools, of, tiberias, sepphoris, and, caesarea, it, is, written, largely, in, jewish, palestinian, aramaic, a, western, aramaic, language, that, differs, from, its, babylonian, counterpart, this, talmud, is, a, synopsis, of, the, analysis, of, the, mishnah, that, was, developed, over, the, course, of, nearly, 200, years, by, the, academies, in, galilee, principally, those, of, tiberias, and, caesarea, because, of, their, location, the, sages, of, these, academies, devoted, considerable, attention, to, the, analysis, of, the, agricultural, laws, of, the, land, of, israel, traditionally, this, talmud, was, thought, to, have, been, redacted, in, about, the, year, 350, by, rav, muna, and, rav, yossi, in, the, land, of, israel, it, is, traditionally, known, as, the, talmud, yerushalmi, jerusalem, talmud, but, the, name, is, a, misnomer, as, it, was, not, prepared, in, jerusalem, it, has, more, accurately, been, called, the, talmud, of, the, land, of, israel, the, eye, and, the, heart, are, two, abettors, to, the, crime, its, final, redaction, probably, belongs, to, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, but, the, individual, scholars, who, brought, it, to, its, present, form, cannot, be, fixed, with, assurance, by, this, time, christianity, had, become, the, state, religion, of, the, roman, empire, and, jerusalem, the, holy, city, of, christendom, in, 325, constantine, the, great, the, first, christian, emperor, wrote, in, a, letter, to, the, churches, concerning, the, first, council, of, nicaea, that, let, us, then, have, nothing, in, common, with, the, detestable, jewish, crowd, the, compilers, of, the, jerusalem, talmud, consequently, lacked, the, time, to, produce, a, work, of, the, quality, they, had, intended, the, text, is, evidently, incomplete, and, is, not, easy, to, follow, the, apparent, cessation, of, work, on, the, jerusalem, talmud, in, the, 5th, century, has, been, associated, with, the, decision, of, theodosius, ii, in, 425, to, suppress, the, patriarchate, and, put, an, end, to, the, practice, of, semikhah, formal, scholarly, ordination, some, modern, scholars, have, questioned, this, connection, just, as, wisdom, has, made, a, crown, for, one, s, head, so, too, humility, has, made, a, sole, for, one, s, foot, despite, its, incomplete, state, the, jerusalem, talmud, remains, an, indispensable, source, of, knowledge, of, the, development, of, the, jewish, law, in, the, holy, land, it, was, also, an, important, primary, source, for, the, study, of, the, babylonian, talmud, by, the, kairouan, school, of, chananel, ben, chushiel, and, nissim, ben, jacob, with, the, result, that, opinions, ultimately, based, on, the, jerusalem, talmud, found, their, way, into, both, the, tosafot, and, the, mishneh, torah, of, maimonides, ethical, maxims, contained, in, the, jerusalem, talmud, are, scattered, and, interspersed, in, the, legal, discussions, throughout, the, several, treatises, many, of, which, differ, from, those, in, the, babylonian, talmud, following, the, formation, of, the, modern, state, of, israel, there, has, been, some, interest, in, restoring, eretz, yisrael, traditions, for, example, rabbi, david, bar, hayim, of, the, makhon, shilo, institute, has, issued, a, siddur, reflecting, eretz, yisrael, practice, as, found, in, the, jerusalem, talmud, and, other, sources, the, babylonian, talmud, talmud, bavli, consists, of, documents, compiled, over, the, period, of, late, antiquity, 3rd, to, 6th, centuries, during, this, time, the, most, important, of, the, jewish, centres, in, mesopotamia, a, region, called, babylonia, in, jewish, sources, see, talmudic, academies, in, babylonia, and, later, known, as, iraq, were, nehardea, nisibis, modern, nusaybin, mahoza, al, mada, in, just, to, the, south, of, what, is, now, baghdad, pumbedita, near, present, day, al, anbar, governorate, and, the, sura, academy, probably, located, about, 60, km, 37, mi, south, of, baghdad, the, babylonian, talmud, comprises, the, mishnah, and, the, babylonian, gemara, the, latter, representing, the, culmination, of, more, than, 300, years, of, analysis, of, the, mishnah, in, the, talmudic, academies, in, babylonia, the, foundations, of, this, process, of, analysis, were, laid, by, abba, arika, 175, 247, a, disciple, of, judah, ha, nasi, tradition, ascribes, the, compilation, of, the, babylonian, talmud, in, its, present, form, to, two, babylonian, sages, rav, ashi, and, ravina, ii, rav, ashi, was, president, of, the, sura, academy, from, 375, to, 427, the, work, begun, by, rav, ashi, was, completed, by, ravina, who, is, traditionally, regarded, as, the, final, amoraic, expounder, accordingly, traditionalists, argue, that, ravina, s, death, in, 475, is, the, latest, possible, date, for, the, completion, of, the, redaction, of, the, talmud, however, even, on, the, most, traditional, view, a, few, passages, are, regarded, as, the, work, of, a, group, of, rabbis, who, edited, the, talmud, after, the, end, of, the, amoraic, period, known, as, the, savoraim, or, rabbanan, savora, e, meaning, reasoners, or, considerers, there, are, significant, differences, between, the, two, talmud, compilations, the, language, of, the, jerusalem, talmud, is, a, western, aramaic, dialect, which, differs, from, the, form, of, aramaic, in, the, babylonian, talmud, the, talmud, yerushalmi, is, often, fragmentary, and, difficult, to, read, even, for, experienced, talmudists, the, redaction, of, the, talmud, bavli, on, the, other, hand, is, more, careful, and, precise, the, law, as, laid, down, in, the, two, compilations, is, basically, similar, except, in, emphasis, and, in, minor, details, the, jerusalem, talmud, has, not, received, much, attention, from, commentators, and, such, traditional, commentaries, as, exist, are, mostly, concerned, with, comparing, its, teachings, to, those, of, the, talmud, bavli, neither, the, jerusalem, nor, the, babylonian, talmud, covers, the, entire, mishnah, for, example, a, babylonian, gemara, exists, only, for, 37, out, of, the, 63, tractates, of, the, mishnah, in, particular, the, babylonian, talmud, records, the, opinions, of, the, rabbis, of, the, ma, arava, the, west, meaning, israel, as, well, as, of, those, of, babylonia, while, the, jerusalem, talmud, seldom, cites, the, babylonian, rabbis, the, babylonian, version, also, contains, the, opinions, of, more, generations, because, of, its, later, date, of, completion, for, both, these, reasons, it, is, regarded, as, a, more, comprehensive, collection, of, the, opinions, available, on, the, other, hand, because, of, the, centuries, of, redaction, between, the, composition, of, the, jerusalem, and, the, babylonian, talmud, the, opinions, of, early, amoraim, might, be, closer, to, their, original, form, in, the, jerusalem, talmud, the, influence, of, the, babylonian, talmud, has, been, far, greater, than, that, of, the, yerushalmi, in, the, main, this, is, because, the, influence, and, prestige, of, the, jewish, community, of, israel, steadily, declined, in, contrast, with, the, babylonian, community, in, the, years, after, the, redaction, of, the, talmud, and, continuing, until, the, gaonic, era, furthermore, the, editing, of, the, babylonian, talmud, was, superior, to, that, of, the, jerusalem, version, making, it, more, accessible, and, readily, usable, according, to, maimonides, whose, life, began, almost, a, hundred, years, after, the, end, of, the, gaonic, era, all, jewish, communities, during, the, gaonic, era, formally, accepted, the, babylonian, talmud, as, binding, upon, themselves, and, modern, jewish, practice, follows, the, babylonian, talmud, s, conclusions, on, all, areas, in, which, the, two, talmuds, conflict, the, structure, of, the, talmud, follows, that, of, the, mishnah, in, which, six, orders, sedarim, singular, seder, of, general, subject, matter, are, divided, into, 60, or, 63, tractates, masekhtot, singular, masekhet, of, more, focused, subject, compilations, though, not, all, tractates, have, gemara, each, tractate, is, divided, into, chapters, perakim, singular, perek, 517, in, total, that, are, both, numbered, according, to, the, hebrew, alphabet, and, given, names, usually, using, the, first, one, or, two, words, in, the, first, mishnah, a, perek, may, continue, over, several, up, to, tens, of, pages, each, perek, will, contain, several, mishnayot, the, mishnah, is, a, compilation, of, legal, opinions, and, debates, statements, in, the, mishnah, are, typically, terse, recording, brief, opinions, of, the, rabbis, debating, a, subject, or, recording, only, an, unattributed, ruling, apparently, representing, a, consensus, view, the, rabbis, recorded, in, the, mishnah, are, known, as, the, tannaim, literally, repeaters, or, teachers, these, tannaim, rabbis, of, the, second, century, ce, who, produced, the, mishnah, and, other, tannaic, works, must, be, distinguished, from, the, rabbis, of, the, third, to, fifth, centuries, known, as, amoraim, literally, speakers, who, produced, the, two, talmudim, and, other, amoraic, works, since, it, sequences, its, laws, by, subject, matter, instead, of, by, biblical, context, the, mishnah, discusses, individual, subjects, more, thoroughly, than, the, midrash, and, it, includes, a, much, broader, selection, of, halakhic, subjects, than, the, midrash, the, mishnah, s, topical, organization, thus, became, the, framework, of, the, talmud, as, a, whole, but, not, every, tractate, in, the, mishnah, has, a, corresponding, gemara, also, the, order, of, the, tractates, in, the, talmud, differs, in, some, cases, from, that, in, the, mishnah, in, addition, to, the, mishnah, other, tannaitic, teachings, were, current, at, about, the, same, time, or, shortly, after, that, the, gemara, frequently, refers, to, these, tannaitic, statements, in, order, to, compare, them, to, those, contained, in, the, mishnah, and, to, support, or, refute, the, propositions, of, the, amoraim, the, baraitot, cited, in, the, gemara, are, often, quotations, from, the, tosefta, a, tannaitic, compendium, of, halakha, parallel, to, the, mishnah, and, the, midrash, halakha, specifically, mekhilta, sifra, and, sifre, some, baraitot, however, are, known, only, through, traditions, cited, in, the, gemara, and, are, not, part, of, any, other, collection, in, the, three, centuries, following, the, redaction, of, the, mishnah, rabbis, in, palestine, and, babylonia, analyzed, debated, and, discussed, that, work, these, discussions, form, the, gemara, the, gemara, mainly, focuses, on, elucidating, and, elaborating, the, opinions, of, the, tannaim, the, rabbis, of, the, gemara, are, known, as, amoraim, sing, amora, much, of, the, gemara, consists, of, legal, analysis, the, starting, point, for, the, analysis, is, usually, a, legal, statement, found, in, a, mishnah, the, statement, is, then, analyzed, and, compared, with, other, statements, used, in, different, approaches, to, biblical, exegesis, in, rabbinic, judaism, or, simpler, interpretation, of, text, in, torah, study, exchanges, between, two, frequently, anonymous, and, sometimes, metaphorical, disputants, termed, the, makshan, questioner, and, tartzan, answerer, another, important, function, of, gemara, is, to, identify, the, correct, biblical, basis, for, a, given, law, presented, in, the, mishnah, and, the, logical, process, connecting, one, with, the, other, this, activity, was, known, as, talmud, long, before, the, existence, of, the, talmud, as, a, text, in, addition, to, the, six, orders, the, talmud, contains, a, series, of, short, treatises, of, a, later, date, usually, printed, at, the, end, of, seder, nezikin, these, are, not, divided, into, mishnah, and, gemara, the, oldest, full, manuscript, of, the, talmud, known, as, the, munich, talmud, codex, hebraicus, 95, dates, from, 1342, and, is, available, online, manuscripts, of, the, talmud, are, as, follows, the, exact, date, at, which, the, talmud, was, compiled, appears, to, have, been, forgotten, at, least, by, the, second, half, of, the, middle, ages, when, estimates, between, the, 3rd, century, bce, to, the, 9th, century, ce, are, suggested, in, the, wikkuah, a, text, that, records, the, debates, that, took, place, in, the, disputation, of, paris, also, known, as, the, trial, of, the, talmud, which, took, place, in, 1240, a, wide, range, of, dates, have, been, proposed, for, the, babylonian, talmud, by, historians, the, text, was, most, likely, completed, however, in, the, 6th, century, or, prior, to, the, early, muslim, conquests, in, 643, 636, ce, at, the, latest, on, the, basis, that, the, talmud, lacks, loanwords, or, syntax, deriving, from, arabic, additional, external, evidence, for, a, latest, possible, date, for, the, composition, of, the, babylonian, talmud, are, the, uses, of, it, by, external, sources, including, the, letter, of, baboi, mid, 8th, century, seder, tannaim, veamoraim, 9th, century, and, a, 10th, century, letter, by, sherira, gaon, addressing, the, formation, of, the, babylonian, talmud, as, for, a, lower, boundary, on, the, dating, of, the, babylonian, talmud, it, must, post, date, the, early, 5th, century, given, its, reliance, on, the, jerusalem, talmud, within, the, gemara, the, quotations, from, the, mishnah, and, the, baraitas, and, verses, of, tanakh, quoted, and, embedded, in, the, gemara, are, in, either, mishnaic, or, biblical, hebrew, the, rest, of, the, gemara, including, the, discussions, of, the, amoraim, and, the, overall, framework, is, in, a, characteristic, dialect, of, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, there, are, occasional, quotations, from, older, works, in, other, dialects, of, aramaic, such, as, megillat, taanit, overall, hebrew, constitutes, somewhat, less, than, half, of, the, text, of, the, talmud, this, difference, in, language, is, due, to, the, long, time, period, elapsing, between, the, two, compilations, during, the, period, of, the, tannaim, rabbis, cited, in, the, mishnah, a, late, form, of, hebrew, known, as, rabbinic, or, mishnaic, hebrew, was, still, in, use, as, a, spoken, vernacular, among, jews, in, judaea, alongside, greek, and, aramaic, whereas, during, the, period, of, the, amoraim, rabbis, cited, in, the, gemara, which, began, around, the, year, 200, the, spoken, vernacular, was, almost, exclusively, aramaic, hebrew, continued, to, be, used, for, the, writing, of, religious, texts, poetry, and, so, forth, even, within, the, aramaic, of, the, gemara, different, dialects, or, writing, styles, can, be, observed, in, different, tractates, one, dialect, is, common, to, most, of, the, babylonian, talmud, while, a, second, dialect, is, used, in, nedarim, nazir, temurah, keritot, and, me, ilah, the, second, dialect, is, closer, in, style, to, the, targum, from, the, time, of, its, completion, the, talmud, became, integral, to, jewish, scholarship, a, maxim, in, pirkei, avot, advocates, its, study, from, the, age, of, 15, this, section, outlines, some, of, the, major, areas, of, talmudic, study, the, earliest, talmud, commentaries, were, written, by, the, geonim, c, 800, 1000, in, babylonia, although, some, direct, commentaries, on, particular, treatises, are, extant, our, main, knowledge, of, the, gaonic, era, talmud, scholarship, comes, from, statements, embedded, in, geonic, responsa, that, shed, light, on, talmudic, passages, these, are, arranged, in, the, order, of, the, talmud, in, levin, s, otzar, ha, geonim, also, important, are, practical, abridgments, of, jewish, law, such, as, yehudai, gaon, s, halachot, pesukot, achai, gaon, s, sheeltot, and, simeon, kayyara, s, halachot, gedolot, after, the, death, of, hai, gaon, however, the, center, of, talmud, scholarship, shifts, to, europe, and, north, africa, one, area, of, talmudic, scholarship, developed, out, of, the, need, to, ascertain, the, halakha, early, commentators, such, as, rabbi, isaac, alfasi, north, africa, 1013, 1103, attempted, to, extract, and, determine, the, binding, legal, opinions, from, the, vast, corpus, of, the, talmud, alfasi, s, work, was, highly, influential, attracted, several, commentaries, in, its, own, right, and, later, served, as, a, basis, for, the, creation, of, halakhic, codes, another, influential, medieval, halakhic, work, following, the, order, of, the, babylonian, talmud, and, to, some, extent, modelled, on, alfasi, was, the, mordechai, a, compilation, by, mordechai, ben, hillel, c, 1250, 1298, a, third, such, work, was, that, of, rabbi, asher, ben, yechiel, d, 1327, all, these, works, and, their, commentaries, are, printed, in, the, vilna, and, many, subsequent, editions, of, the, talmud, a, 15th, century, spanish, rabbi, jacob, ibn, habib, d, 1516, composed, the, ein, yaakov, ein, yaakov, or, en, ya, aqob, extracts, nearly, all, the, aggadic, material, from, the, talmud, it, was, intended, to, familiarize, the, public, with, the, ethical, parts, of, the, talmud, and, to, dispute, many, of, the, accusations, surrounding, its, contents, the, commentaries, on, the, talmud, constitute, only, a, small, part, of, rabbinic, literature, in, comparison, with, the, responsa, literature, and, the, commentaries, on, the, codices, when, the, talmud, was, concluded, the, traditional, literature, was, still, so, fresh, in, the, memory, of, scholars, that, no, need, existed, for, writing, talmudic, commentaries, nor, were, such, works, undertaken, in, the, first, period, of, the, gaonate, paltoi, ben, abaye, c, 840, was, the, first, who, in, his, responsum, offered, verbal, and, textual, comments, on, the, talmud, his, son, zemah, ben, paltoi, paraphrased, and, explained, the, passages, which, he, quoted, and, he, composed, as, an, aid, to, the, study, of, the, talmud, a, lexicon, which, abraham, zacuto, consulted, in, the, fifteenth, century, saadia, gaon, is, said, to, have, composed, commentaries, on, the, talmud, aside, from, his, arabic, commentaries, on, the, mishnah, there, are, many, passages, in, the, talmud, which, are, cryptic, and, difficult, to, understand, its, language, contains, many, greek, and, persian, words, that, became, obscure, over, time, a, major, area, of, talmudic, scholarship, developed, to, explain, these, passages, and, words, some, early, commentators, such, as, rabbenu, gershom, of, mainz, 10th, century, and, rabbenu, ananel, early, 11th, century, produced, running, commentaries, to, various, tractates, these, commentaries, could, be, read, with, the, text, of, the, talmud, and, would, help, explain, the, meaning, of, the, text, another, important, work, is, the, sefer, ha, maftea, book, of, the, key, by, nissim, gaon, which, contains, a, preface, explaining, the, different, forms, of, talmudic, argumentation, and, then, explains, abbreviated, passages, in, the, talmud, by, cross, referring, to, parallel, passages, where, the, same, thought, is, expressed, in, full, commentaries, iddushim, by, joseph, ibn, migash, on, two, tractates, bava, batra, and, shevuot, based, on, ananel, and, alfasi, also, survive, as, does, a, compilation, by, zechariah, aghmati, called, sefer, ha, ner, using, a, different, style, rabbi, nathan, b, jechiel, created, a, lexicon, called, the, arukh, in, the, 11th, century, to, help, translate, difficult, words, by, far, the, best, known, commentary, on, the, babylonian, talmud, is, that, of, rashi, rabbi, solomon, ben, isaac, 1040, 1105, the, commentary, is, comprehensive, covering, almost, the, entire, talmud, written, as, a, running, commentary, it, provides, a, full, explanation, of, the, words, and, explains, the, logical, structure, of, each, talmudic, passage, it, is, considered, indispensable, to, students, of, the, talmud, although, rashi, drew, upon, all, his, predecessors, his, originality, in, using, the, material, offered, by, them, was, unparalleled, his, commentaries, in, turn, became, the, basis, of, the, work, of, his, pupils, and, successors, who, composed, a, large, number, of, supplementary, works, that, were, partly, in, emendation, and, partly, in, explanation, of, rashi, s, and, are, known, under, the, title, tosafot, additions, or, supplements, the, tosafot, are, collected, commentaries, by, various, medieval, ashkenazic, rabbis, on, the, talmud, known, as, tosafists, or, ba, alei, tosafot, one, of, the, main, goals, of, the, tosafot, is, to, explain, and, interpret, contradictory, statements, in, the, talmud, unlike, rashi, the, tosafot, is, not, a, running, commentary, but, rather, comments, on, selected, matters, often, the, explanations, of, tosafot, differ, from, those, of, rashi, in, yeshiva, the, integration, of, talmud, rashi, and, tosafot, is, considered, as, the, foundation, and, prerequisite, for, further, analysis, this, combination, is, sometimes, referred, to, by, the, acronym, gefet, gemara, perush, rashi, tosafot, among, the, founders, of, the, tosafist, school, were, rabbi, jacob, ben, meir, known, as, rabbeinu, tam, who, was, a, grandson, of, rashi, and, rabbenu, tam, s, nephew, rabbi, isaac, ben, samuel, the, tosafot, commentaries, were, collected, in, different, editions, in, the, various, schools, the, benchmark, collection, of, tosafot, for, northern, france, was, that, of, r, eliezer, of, touques, the, standard, collection, for, spain, was, that, of, rabbenu, asher, tosefot, harosh, the, tosafot, that, are, printed, in, the, standard, vilna, edition, of, the, talmud, are, an, edited, version, compiled, from, the, various, medieval, collections, predominantly, that, of, touques, over, time, the, approach, of, the, tosafists, spread, to, other, jewish, communities, particularly, those, in, spain, this, led, to, the, composition, of, many, other, commentaries, in, similar, styles, among, these, are, the, commentaries, of, nachmanides, ramban, solomon, ben, adret, rashba, yom, tov, of, seville, ritva, and, nissim, of, gerona, ran, these, are, often, titled, chiddushei, novellae, of, a, comprehensive, anthology, consisting, of, extracts, from, all, these, is, the, shittah, mekubbetzet, of, bezalel, ashkenazi, other, commentaries, produced, in, spain, and, provence, were, not, influenced, by, the, tosafist, style, two, of, the, most, significant, of, these, are, the, yad, ramah, by, rabbi, meir, abulafia, and, bet, habechirah, by, rabbi, menahem, hameiri, commonly, referred, to, as, meiri, while, the, bet, habechirah, is, extant, for, all, of, talmud, we, only, have, the, yad, ramah, for, tractates, sanhedrin, baba, batra, and, gittin, like, the, commentaries, of, ramban, and, the, others, these, are, generally, printed, as, independent, works, though, some, talmud, editions, include, the, shittah, mekubbetzet, in, an, abbreviated, form, in, later, centuries, focus, partially, shifted, from, direct, talmudic, interpretation, to, the, analysis, of, previously, written, talmudic, commentaries, these, later, commentaries, are, generally, printed, at, the, back, of, each, tractate, well, known, are, maharshal, solomon, luria, maharam, meir, lublin, and, maharsha, samuel, edels, which, analyze, rashi, and, tosafot, together, other, such, commentaries, include, ma, adanei, yom, tov, by, yom, tov, lipmann, heller, in, turn, a, commentary, on, the, rosh, see, below, and, the, glosses, by, zvi, hirsch, chajes, another, very, useful, study, aid, found, in, almost, all, editions, of, the, talmud, consists, of, the, marginal, notes, torah, or, ein, mishpat, ner, mitzvah, and, masoret, ha, shas, by, the, italian, rabbi, joshua, boaz, which, give, references, respectively, to, the, cited, biblical, passages, to, the, relevant, halachic, codes, mishneh, torah, tur, shulchan, aruch, and, se, mag, and, to, related, talmudic, passages, most, editions, of, the, talmud, include, brief, marginal, notes, by, akiva, eger, under, the, name, gilyon, ha, shas, and, textual, notes, by, joel, sirkes, and, the, vilna, gaon, see, textual, emendations, below, on, the, page, together, with, the, text, commentaries, discussing, the, halachik, legal, content, include, rosh, rif, and, mordechai, these, are, now, standard, appendices, to, each, volume, rambam, s, mishneh, torah, is, invariably, studied, alongside, these, three, although, a, code, and, therefore, not, in, the, same, order, as, the, talmud, the, relevant, location, is, identified, via, the, ein, mishpat, as, mentioned, a, recent, project, halacha, brura, founded, by, abraham, isaac, kook, presents, the, talmud, and, a, summary, of, the, halachic, codes, side, by, side, so, as, to, enable, the, collation, of, talmud, with, resultant, halacha, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, a, new, intensive, form, of, talmud, study, arose, complicated, logical, arguments, were, used, to, explain, minor, points, of, contradiction, within, the, talmud, the, term, pilpul, was, applied, to, this, type, of, study, usage, of, pilpul, in, this, sense, that, of, sharp, analysis, harks, back, to, the, talmudic, era, and, refers, to, the, intellectual, sharpness, this, method, demanded, pilpul, practitioners, posited, that, the, talmud, could, contain, no, redundancy, or, contradiction, whatsoever, new, categories, and, distinctions, hillukim, were, therefore, created, resolving, seeming, contradictions, within, the, talmud, by, novel, logical, means, in, the, ashkenazi, world, the, founders, of, pilpul, are, generally, considered, to, be, jacob, pollak, 1460, 1541, and, shalom, shachna, this, kind, of, study, reached, its, height, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, when, expertise, in, pilpulistic, analysis, was, considered, an, art, form, and, became, a, goal, in, and, of, itself, within, the, yeshivot, of, poland, and, lithuania, but, the, popular, new, method, of, talmud, study, was, not, without, critics, already, in, the, 15th, century, the, ethical, tract, orhot, zaddikim, paths, of, the, righteous, in, hebrew, criticized, pilpul, for, an, overemphasis, on, intellectual, acuity, many, 16th, and, 17th, century, rabbis, were, also, critical, of, pilpul, among, them, are, judah, loew, ben, bezalel, the, maharal, of, prague, isaiah, horowitz, and, yair, bacharach, by, the, 18th, century, pilpul, study, waned, other, styles, of, learning, such, as, that, of, the, school, of, elijah, b, solomon, the, vilna, gaon, became, popular, the, term, pilpul, was, increasingly, applied, derogatorily, to, novellae, deemed, casuistic, and, hairsplitting, authors, referred, to, their, own, commentaries, as, al, derekh, ha, peshat, by, the, simple, method, to, contrast, them, with, pilpul, among, sephardi, and, italian, jews, from, the, 15th, century, on, some, authorities, sought, to, apply, the, methods, of, aristotelian, logic, as, reformulated, by, averroes, this, method, was, first, recorded, though, without, explicit, reference, to, aristotle, by, isaac, campanton, d, spain, 1463, in, his, darkhei, ha, talmud, the, ways, of, the, talmud, and, is, also, found, in, the, works, of, moses, chaim, luzzatto, according, to, the, present, day, sephardi, scholar, jos, faur, traditional, sephardic, talmud, study, could, take, place, on, any, of, three, levels, today, most, sephardic, yeshivot, follow, lithuanian, approaches, such, as, the, brisker, method, the, traditional, sephardic, methods, are, perpetuated, informally, by, some, individuals, iyyun, tunisa, i, is, taught, at, the, kisse, rahamim, yeshivah, in, bnei, brak, in, the, late, 19th, century, another, trend, in, talmud, study, arose, rabbi, hayyim, soloveitchik, 1853, 1918, of, brisk, brest, litovsk, developed, and, refined, this, style, of, study, brisker, method, involves, a, reductionistic, analysis, of, rabbinic, arguments, within, the, talmud, or, among, the, rishonim, explaining, the, differing, opinions, by, placing, them, within, a, categorical, structure, the, brisker, method, is, highly, analytical, and, is, often, criticized, as, being, a, modern, day, version, of, pilpul, nevertheless, the, influence, of, the, brisker, method, is, great, most, modern, day, yeshivot, study, the, talmud, using, the, brisker, method, in, some, form, one, feature, of, this, method, is, the, use, of, maimonides, mishneh, torah, as, a, guide, to, talmudic, interpretation, as, distinct, from, its, use, as, a, source, of, practical, halakha, rival, methods, were, those, of, the, mir, and, telz, yeshivas, see, chaim, rabinowitz, telshe, and, yeshiva, ohel, torah, baranovich, style, of, learning, as, a, result, of, jewish, emancipation, judaism, underwent, enormous, upheaval, and, transformation, during, the, 19th, century, modern, methods, of, textual, and, historical, analysis, were, applied, to, the, talmud, the, text, of, the, talmud, has, been, subject, to, some, level, of, critical, scrutiny, throughout, its, history, rabbinic, tradition, holds, that, the, people, cited, in, both, talmuds, did, not, have, a, hand, in, its, writings, rather, their, teachings, were, edited, into, a, rough, form, around, 450, ce, talmud, yerushalmi, and, 550, ce, talmud, bavli, the, text, of, the, bavli, especially, was, not, firmly, fixed, at, that, time, gaonic, responsa, literature, addresses, this, issue, teshuvot, geonim, kadmonim, section, 78, deals, with, mistaken, biblical, readings, in, the, talmud, this, gaonic, responsum, states, but, you, must, examine, carefully, in, every, case, when, you, feel, uncertainty, what, is, its, source, whether, a, scribal, error, or, the, superficiality, of, a, second, rate, student, who, was, not, well, versed, after, the, manner, of, many, mistakes, found, among, those, superficial, second, rate, students, and, certainly, among, those, rural, memorizers, who, were, not, familiar, with, the, biblical, text, and, since, they, erred, in, the, first, place, in, the, early, medieval, era, rashi, already, concluded, that, some, statements, in, the, extant, text, of, the, talmud, were, insertions, from, later, editors, on, shevuot, 3b, rashi, writes, a, mistaken, student, wrote, this, in, the, margin, of, the, talmud, and, copyists, put, it, into, the, gemara, the, emendations, of, yoel, sirkis, and, the, vilna, gaon, are, included, in, all, standard, editions, of, the, talmud, in, the, form, of, marginal, glosses, entitled, hagahot, ha, bach, and, hagahot, ha, gra, respectively, further, emendations, by, solomon, luria, are, set, out, in, commentary, form, at, the, back, of, each, tractate, the, vilna, gaon, s, emendations, were, often, based, on, his, quest, for, internal, consistency, in, the, text, rather, than, on, manuscript, evidence, nevertheless, many, of, the, gaon, s, emendations, were, later, verified, by, textual, critics, such, as, solomon, schechter, who, had, cairo, genizah, texts, with, which, to, compare, our, standard, editions, in, the, 19th, century, raphael, nathan, nota, rabinovicz, published, a, multi, volume, work, entitled, dikdukei, soferim, showing, textual, variants, from, the, munich, and, other, early, manuscripts, of, the, talmud, and, further, variants, are, recorded, in, the, complete, israeli, talmud, and, gemara, shelemah, editions, see, critical, editions, above, today, many, more, manuscripts, have, become, available, in, particular, from, the, cairo, geniza, the, academy, of, the, hebrew, language, has, prepared, a, text, on, cd, rom, for, lexicographical, purposes, containing, the, text, of, each, tractate, according, to, the, manuscript, it, considers, most, reliable, and, images, of, some, of, the, older, manuscripts, may, be, found, on, the, website, of, the, national, library, of, israel, formerly, the, jewish, national, and, university, library, the, nli, the, lieberman, institute, associated, with, the, jewish, theological, seminary, of, america, the, institute, for, the, complete, israeli, talmud, part, of, yad, harav, herzog, and, the, friedberg, jewish, manuscript, society, all, maintain, searchable, websites, on, which, the, viewer, can, request, variant, manuscript, readings, of, a, given, passage, further, variant, readings, can, often, be, gleaned, from, citations, in, secondary, literature, such, as, commentaries, in, particular, those, of, alfasi, rabbenu, ananel, and, aghmati, and, sometimes, the, later, spanish, commentators, such, as, nachmanides, and, solomon, ben, adret, historical, study, of, the, talmud, can, be, used, to, investigate, a, variety, of, concerns, one, can, ask, questions, such, as, do, a, given, section, s, sources, date, from, its, editor, s, lifetime, to, what, extent, does, a, section, have, earlier, or, later, sources, are, talmudic, disputes, distinguishable, along, theological, or, communal, lines, in, what, ways, do, different, sections, derive, from, different, schools, of, thought, within, early, judaism, can, these, early, sources, be, identified, and, if, so, how, investigation, of, questions, such, as, these, are, known, as, higher, textual, criticism, the, term, criticism, is, a, technical, term, denoting, academic, study, religious, scholars, still, debate, the, precise, method, by, which, the, text, of, the, talmuds, reached, their, final, form, many, believe, that, the, text, was, continuously, smoothed, over, by, the, savoraim, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, rabbi, raphael, natan, nata, rabbinovitz, engaged, in, the, historical, study, of, talmud, bavli, in, his, diqduqei, soferim, since, then, many, orthodox, rabbis, have, approved, of, his, work, including, rabbis, shlomo, kluger, joseph, saul, nathansohn, jacob, ettlinger, isaac, elhanan, spektor, and, shimon, sofer, during, the, early, 19th, century, leaders, of, the, newly, evolving, reform, movement, such, as, abraham, geiger, and, samuel, holdheim, subjected, the, talmud, to, severe, scrutiny, as, part, of, an, effort, to, break, with, traditional, rabbinic, judaism, they, insisted, that, the, talmud, was, entirely, a, work, of, evolution, and, development, this, view, was, rejected, as, both, academically, incorrect, and, religiously, incorrect, by, those, who, would, become, known, as, the, orthodox, movement, some, orthodox, leaders, such, as, moses, sofer, the, chatam, sofer, became, exquisitely, sensitive, to, any, change, and, rejected, modern, critical, methods, of, talmud, study, some, rabbis, advocated, a, view, of, talmudic, study, that, they, held, to, be, in, between, the, reformers, and, the, orthodox, these, were, the, adherents, of, positive, historical, judaism, notably, nachman, krochmal, and, zecharias, frankel, they, described, the, oral, torah, as, the, result, of, a, historical, and, exegetical, process, emerging, over, time, through, the, application, of, authorized, exegetical, techniques, and, more, importantly, the, subjective, dispositions, and, personalities, and, current, historical, conditions, by, learned, sages, this, was, later, developed, more, fully, in, the, five, volume, work, dor, dor, ve, dorshav, by, isaac, hirsch, weiss, see, jay, harris, guiding, the, perplexed, in, the, modern, age, ch, 5, eventually, their, work, came, to, be, one, of, the, formative, parts, of, conservative, judaism, another, aspect, of, this, movement, is, reflected, in, graetz, s, history, of, the, jews, graetz, attempts, to, deduce, the, personality, of, the, pharisees, based, on, the, laws, or, aggadot, that, they, cite, and, show, that, their, personalities, influenced, the, laws, they, expounded, the, leader, of, orthodox, jewry, in, germany, samson, raphael, hirsch, while, not, rejecting, the, methods, of, scholarship, in, principle, hotly, contested, the, findings, of, the, historical, critical, method, in, a, series, of, articles, in, his, magazine, jeschurun, reprinted, in, collected, writings, vol, 5, hirsch, reiterated, the, traditional, view, and, pointed, out, what, he, saw, as, numerous, errors, in, the, works, of, graetz, frankel, and, geiger, on, the, other, hand, many, of, the, 19th, century, s, strongest, critics, of, reform, including, strictly, orthodox, rabbis, such, as, zvi, hirsch, chajes, used, this, new, scientific, method, the, orthodox, rabbinical, seminary, of, azriel, hildesheimer, was, founded, on, the, idea, of, creating, a, harmony, between, judaism, and, science, other, orthodox, pioneers, of, scientific, talmud, study, were, david, zvi, hoffmann, and, joseph, hirsch, d, nner, the, iraqi, rabbi, yaakov, chaim, sofer, notes, that, the, text, of, the, gemara, has, had, changes, and, additions, and, contains, statements, not, of, the, same, origin, as, the, original, see, his, yehi, yosef, jerusalem, 1991, p, 132, this, passage, does, not, bear, the, signature, of, the, editor, of, the, talmud, orthodox, scholar, daniel, sperber, writes, in, legitimacy, of, necessity, of, scientific, disciplines, that, many, orthodox, sources, have, engaged, in, the, historical, also, called, scientific, study, of, the, talmud, as, such, the, divide, today, between, orthodoxy, and, reform, is, not, about, whether, the, talmud, may, be, subjected, to, historical, study, but, rather, about, the, theological, and, halakhic, implications, of, such, study, some, trends, within, contemporary, talmud, scholarship, are, listed, below, there, are, six, contemporary, translations, of, the, talmud, into, english, a, widely, accepted, and, accessible, index, was, the, goal, driving, several, such, projects, the, first, complete, edition, of, the, babylonian, talmud, was, printed, in, venice, by, daniel, bomberg, 1520, 23, with, the, support, of, pope, leo, x, in, addition, to, the, mishnah, and, gemara, bomberg, s, edition, contained, the, commentaries, of, rashi, and, tosafot, almost, all, printings, since, bomberg, have, followed, the, same, pagination, bomberg, s, edition, was, considered, relatively, free, of, censorship, ambrosius, frobenius, collaborated, with, the, scholar, israel, ben, daniel, sifroni, from, italy, his, most, extensive, work, was, a, talmud, edition, published, with, great, difficulty, in, 1578, 81, following, ambrosius, frobenius, s, publication, of, most, of, the, talmud, in, installments, in, basel, immanuel, benveniste, published, the, whole, talmud, in, installments, in, amsterdam, 1644, 1648, although, according, to, raphael, rabbinovicz, the, benveniste, talmud, may, have, been, based, on, the, lublin, talmud, and, included, many, of, the, censors, errors, it, is, noteworthy, due, to, the, inclusion, of, avodah, zarah, omitted, due, to, church, censorship, from, several, previous, editions, and, when, printed, often, lacking, a, title, page, the, edition, of, the, talmud, published, by, the, szapira, brothers, in, slavita, was, published, in, 1817, and, it, is, particularly, prized, by, many, rebbes, of, hasidic, judaism, in, 1835, after, a, religious, community, copyright, was, nearly, over, and, following, an, acrimonious, dispute, with, the, szapira, family, a, new, edition, of, the, talmud, was, printed, by, menachem, romm, of, vilna, known, as, the, vilna, edition, shas, this, edition, and, later, ones, printed, by, his, widow, and, sons, the, romm, publishing, house, has, been, used, in, the, production, of, more, recent, editions, of, talmud, bavli, a, page, number, in, the, vilna, talmud, refers, to, a, double, sided, page, known, as, a, daf, or, folio, in, english, each, daf, has, two, amudim, labeled, and, sides, a, and, b, recto, and, verso, the, convention, of, referencing, by, daf, is, relatively, recent, and, dates, from, the, early, talmud, printings, of, the, 17th, century, though, the, actual, pagination, goes, back, to, the, bomberg, edition, earlier, rabbinic, literature, generally, refers, to, the, tractate, or, chapters, within, a, tractate, e, g, berachot, chapter, 1, it, sometimes, also, refers, to, the, specific, mishnah, in, that, chapter, where, mishnah, is, replaced, with, halakha, here, meaning, route, to, direct, the, reader, to, the, entry, in, the, gemara, corresponding, to, that, mishna, e, g, berachot, chapter, 1, halakha, 1, would, refer, to, the, first, mishnah, of, the, first, chapter, in, tractate, berachot, and, its, corresponding, entry, in, the, gemara, however, this, form, is, nowadays, more, commonly, though, not, exclusively, used, when, referring, to, the, jerusalem, talmud, nowadays, reference, is, usually, made, in, format, e, g, berachot, 23b, increasingly, the, symbols, and, are, used, to, indicate, recto, and, verso, respectively, thus, e, g, berachot, 23, these, references, always, refer, to, the, pagination, of, the, vilna, talmud, the, text, of, the, vilna, editions, is, considered, by, scholars, not, to, be, uniformly, reliable, and, there, have, been, a, number, of, attempts, to, collate, textual, variants, there, have, been, critical, editions, of, particular, tractates, e, g, henry, malter, s, edition, of, ta, anit, but, there, is, no, modern, critical, edition, of, the, whole, talmud, modern, editions, such, as, those, of, the, oz, ve, hadar, institute, correct, misprints, and, restore, passages, that, in, earlier, editions, were, modified, or, excised, by, censorship, but, do, not, attempt, a, comprehensive, account, of, textual, variants, one, edition, by, rabbi, yosef, amar, represents, the, yemenite, tradition, and, takes, the, form, of, a, photostatic, reproduction, of, a, vilna, based, print, to, which, yemenite, vocalization, and, textual, variants, have, been, added, by, hand, together, with, printed, introductory, material, collations, of, the, yemenite, manuscripts, of, some, tractates, have, been, published, by, columbia, university, a, number, of, editions, have, been, aimed, at, bringing, the, talmud, to, a, wider, audience, aside, from, the, steinsaltz, and, artscroll, schottenstein, sets, there, are, lazarus, goldschmidt, published, an, edition, from, the, uncensored, text, of, the, babylonian, talmud, with, a, german, translation, in, 9, volumes, commenced, leipzig, 1897, 1909, edition, completed, following, emigration, to, england, in, 1933, by, 1936, twelve, volumes, of, the, babylonian, talmud, were, published, by, mir, yeshiva, refugees, during, the, years, 1942, thru, 1946, while, they, were, in, shanghai, the, major, tractates, one, per, volume, were, shabbat, eruvin, pesachim, gittin, kiddushin, nazir, sotah, bava, kama, sanhedrin, makot, shevuot, avodah, zara, with, some, volumes, having, in, addition, minor, tractates, a, survivors, talmud, was, published, encouraged, by, president, truman, s, responsibility, toward, these, victims, of, persecution, statement, the, u, s, army, despite, the, acute, shortage, of, paper, in, germany, agreed, to, print, fifty, copies, of, the, talmud, packaged, into, 16, volume, sets, during, 1947, 1950, the, plan, was, extended, 3, 000, copies, in, 19, volume, sets, the, talmud, represents, the, written, record, of, an, oral, tradition, it, provides, an, understanding, of, how, laws, are, derived, and, it, became, the, basis, for, many, rabbinic, legal, codes, and, customs, most, importantly, for, the, mishneh, torah, and, for, the, shulchan, aruch, orthodox, and, to, a, lesser, extent, conservative, judaism, accept, the, talmud, as, authoritative, while, samaritan, karaite, reconstructionist, and, reform, judaism, do, not, the, jewish, sect, of, the, sadducees, hebrew, flourished, during, the, second, temple, period, principal, distinctions, between, them, and, the, pharisees, later, known, as, rabbinic, judaism, involved, their, rejection, of, an, oral, torah, and, their, denying, a, resurrection, after, death, another, movement, that, rejected, the, oral, torah, as, authoritative, was, karaism, which, arose, within, two, centuries, after, the, completion, of, the, talmud, karaism, developed, as, a, reaction, against, the, talmudic, judaism, of, babylonia, the, central, concept, of, karaism, is, the, rejection, of, the, oral, torah, as, embodied, in, the, talmud, in, favor, of, a, strict, adherence, only, to, the, written, torah, this, opposes, the, fundamental, rabbinic, concept, that, the, oral, torah, was, given, to, moses, on, mount, sinai, together, with, the, written, torah, some, later, karaites, took, a, more, moderate, stance, allowing, that, some, element, of, tradition, called, sevel, ha, yerushah, the, burden, of, inheritance, is, admissible, in, interpreting, the, torah, and, that, some, authentic, traditions, are, contained, in, the, mishnah, and, the, talmud, though, these, can, never, supersede, the, plain, meaning, of, the, written, torah, the, rise, of, reform, judaism, during, the, 19th, century, saw, more, questioning, of, the, authority, of, the, talmud, reform, jews, saw, the, talmud, as, a, product, of, late, antiquity, having, relevance, merely, as, a, historical, document, for, example, the, declaration, of, principles, issued, by, the, association, of, friends, of, reform, frankfurt, in, august, 1843, states, among, other, things, that, the, collection, of, controversies, dissertations, and, prescriptions, commonly, designated, by, the, name, talmud, possesses, for, us, no, authority, from, either, the, dogmatic, or, the, practical, standpoint, some, took, a, critical, historical, view, of, the, written, torah, as, well, while, others, appeared, to, adopt, a, neo, karaite, back, to, the, bible, approach, though, often, with, greater, emphasis, on, the, prophetic, than, on, the, legal, books, within, humanistic, judaism, talmud, is, studied, as, a, historical, text, in, order, to, discover, how, it, can, demonstrate, practical, relevance, to, living, today, orthodox, judaism, continues, to, stress, the, importance, of, talmud, study, as, a, central, component, of, yeshiva, curriculum, in, particular, for, those, training, to, become, rabbis, this, is, so, even, though, halakha, is, generally, studied, from, the, medieval, and, early, modern, codes, and, not, directly, from, the, talmud, talmudic, study, amongst, the, laity, is, widespread, in, orthodox, judaism, with, daily, or, weekly, talmud, study, particularly, common, in, haredi, judaism, and, with, talmud, study, a, central, part, of, the, curriculum, in, orthodox, yeshivas, and, day, schools, the, regular, study, of, talmud, among, laymen, has, been, popularized, by, the, daf, yomi, a, daily, course, of, talmud, study, initiated, by, rabbi, meir, shapiro, in, 1923, its, 13th, cycle, of, study, began, in, august, 2012, and, ended, with, the, 13th, siyum, hashas, on, january, 1, 2020, the, rohr, jewish, learning, institute, has, popularized, the, myshiur, explorations, in, talmud, to, show, how, the, talmud, is, relevant, to, a, wide, range, of, people, conservative, judaism, similarly, emphasizes, the, study, of, talmud, within, its, religious, and, rabbinic, education, generally, however, conservative, jews, study, the, talmud, as, a, historical, source, text, for, halakha, the, conservative, approach, to, legal, decision, making, emphasizes, placing, classic, texts, and, prior, decisions, in, a, historical, and, cultural, context, and, examining, the, historical, development, of, halakha, this, approach, has, resulted, in, greater, practical, flexibility, than, that, of, the, orthodox, talmud, study, forms, part, of, the, curriculum, of, conservative, parochial, education, at, many, conservative, day, schools, and, an, increase, in, conservative, day, school, enrollments, has, resulted, in, an, increase, in, talmud, study, as, part, of, conservative, jewish, education, among, a, minority, of, conservative, jews, see, also, the, conservative, jewish, view, of, the, halakha, reform, judaism, does, not, emphasize, the, study, of, talmud, to, the, same, degree, in, their, hebrew, schools, but, they, do, teach, it, in, their, rabbinical, seminaries, the, world, view, of, liberal, judaism, rejects, the, idea, of, binding, jewish, law, and, uses, the, talmud, as, a, source, of, inspiration, and, moral, instruction, ownership, and, reading, of, the, talmud, is, not, widespread, among, reform, and, reconstructionist, jews, who, usually, place, more, emphasis, on, the, study, of, the, hebrew, bible, or, tanakh, rabbis, and, talmudists, studying, and, debating, talmud, abound, in, the, art, of, austrian, painter, carl, schleicher, 1825, 1903, active, in, vienna, especially, c, 1859, 1871, the, study, of, talmud, is, not, restricted, to, those, of, the, jewish, religion, and, has, attracted, interest, in, other, cultures, christian, scholars, have, long, expressed, an, interest, in, the, study, of, talmud, which, has, helped, illuminate, their, own, scriptures, talmud, contains, biblical, exegesis, and, commentary, on, tanakh, that, will, often, clarify, elliptical, and, esoteric, passages, the, talmud, contains, possible, references, to, jesus, and, his, disciples, while, the, christian, canon, makes, mention, of, talmudic, figures, and, contains, teachings, that, can, be, paralleled, within, the, talmud, and, midrash, the, talmud, provides, cultural, and, historical, context, to, the, gospel, and, the, writings, of, the, apostles, south, koreans, reportedly, hope, to, emulate, jews, high, academic, standards, by, studying, jewish, literature, almost, every, household, has, a, translated, copy, of, a, book, they, call, talmud, which, parents, read, to, their, children, and, the, book, is, part, of, the, primary, school, curriculum, the, talmud, in, this, case, is, usually, one, of, several, possible, volumes, the, earliest, translated, into, korean, from, the, japanese, the, original, japanese, books, were, created, through, the, collaboration, of, japanese, writer, hideaki, kase, and, marvin, tokayer, an, orthodox, american, rabbi, serving, in,

in, korea, and, talmud, books, all, based, on, tokayer, s, works, and, not, the, original, talmud, are, widely, read, and, known, historian, michael, levi, rodkinson, in, his, book, the, history, of, the, talmud, wrote, that, detractors, of, the, talmud, both, during, and, subsequent, to, its, formation, have, varied, in, their, character, objects, and, actions, and, the, book, documents, a, number, of, critics, and, persecutors, including, nicholas, donin, johannes, pfefferkorn, johann, andreas, eisenmenger, the, frankists, and, august, rohling, many, attacks, come, from, antisemitic, sources, such, as, justinas, pranaitis, elizabeth, dilling, or, david, duke, criticisms, also, arise, from, christian, muslim, and, jewish, sources, as, well, as, from, atheists, and, skeptics, accusations, against, the, talmud, include, alleged, defenders, of, the, talmud, point, out, that, many, of, these, criticisms, particularly, those, in, antisemitic, sources, are, based, on, quotations, that, are, taken, out, of, context, and, thus, misrepresent, the, meaning, of, the, talmud, s, text, and, its, basic, character, as, a, detailed, record, of, discussions, that, preserved, statements, by, a, variety, of, sages, and, from, which, statements, and, opinions, that, were, rejected, were, never, edited, out, sometimes, the, misrepresentation, is, deliberate, and, other, times, simply, due, to, an, inability, to, grasp, the, subtle, and, sometimes, confusing, and, multi, faceted, narratives, in, the, talmud, some, quotations, provided, by, critics, deliberately, omit, passages, in, order, to, generate, quotes, that, appear, to, be, offensive, or, insulting, at, the, very, time, that, the, babylonian, savoraim, put, the, finishing, touches, to, the, redaction, of, the, talmud, the, emperor, justinian, issued, his, edict, against, deuterosis, doubling, repetition, of, the, hebrew, bible, it, is, disputed, whether, in, this, context, deuterosis, means, mishnah, or, targum, in, patristic, literature, the, word, is, used, in, both, senses, full, scale, attacks, on, the, talmud, took, place, in, the, 13th, century, in, france, where, talmudic, study, was, then, flourishing, in, the, 1230s, nicholas, donin, a, jewish, convert, to, christianity, pressed, 35, charges, against, the, talmud, to, pope, gregory, ix, by, translating, a, series, of, allegedly, blasphemous, passages, about, jesus, mary, or, christianity, there, is, a, quoted, talmudic, passage, for, example, where, a, person, named, yeshu, who, some, people, have, claimed, is, jesus, of, nazareth, is, sent, to, gehenna, to, be, boiled, in, excrement, for, eternity, donin, also, selected, an, injunction, of, the, talmud, that, permits, jews, to, kill, non, jews, this, led, to, the, disputation, of, paris, which, took, place, in, 1240, at, the, court, of, louis, ix, of, france, where, four, rabbis, including, yechiel, of, paris, and, moses, ben, jacob, of, coucy, defended, the, talmud, against, the, accusations, of, nicholas, donin, the, translation, of, the, talmud, from, aramaic, to, non, jewish, languages, stripped, jewish, discourse, from, its, covering, something, that, was, resented, by, jews, as, a, profound, violation, the, disputation, of, paris, led, to, the, condemnation, and, the, first, burning, of, copies, of, the, talmud, in, paris, in, 1242, the, burning, of, copies, of, the, talmud, continued, the, talmud, was, likewise, the, subject, of, the, disputation, of, barcelona, in, 1263, between, nahmanides, rabbi, moses, ben, nahman, and, christian, convert, pablo, christiani, this, same, pablo, christiani, made, an, attack, on, the, talmud, that, resulted, in, a, papal, bull, against, the, talmud, and, in, the, first, censorship, which, was, undertaken, at, barcelona, by, a, commission, of, dominicans, who, ordered, the, cancellation, of, passages, deemed, objectionable, from, a, christian, perspective, 1264, at, the, disputation, of, tortosa, in, 1413, geronimo, de, santa, f, brought, forward, a, number, of, accusations, including, the, fateful, assertion, that, the, condemnations, of, pagans, heathens, and, apostates, found, in, the, talmud, were, in, reality, veiled, references, to, christians, these, assertions, were, denied, by, the, jewish, community, and, its, scholars, who, contended, that, judaic, thought, made, a, sharp, distinction, between, those, classified, as, heathen, or, pagan, being, polytheistic, and, those, who, acknowledge, one, true, god, such, as, the, christians, even, while, worshipping, the, true, monotheistic, god, incorrectly, thus, jews, viewed, christians, as, misguided, and, in, error, but, not, among, the, heathens, or, pagans, discussed, in, the, talmud, both, pablo, christiani, and, geronimo, de, santa, f, in, addition, to, criticizing, the, talmud, also, regarded, it, as, a, source, of, authentic, traditions, some, of, which, could, be, used, as, arguments, in, favor, of, christianity, examples, of, such, traditions, were, statements, that, the, messiah, was, born, around, the, time, of, the, destruction, of, the, temple, and, that, the, messiah, sat, at, the, right, hand, of, god, in, 1415, antipope, benedict, xiii, who, had, convened, the, tortosa, disputation, issued, a, papal, bull, which, was, destined, however, to, remain, inoperative, forbidding, the, jews, to, read, the, talmud, and, ordering, the, destruction, of, all, copies, of, it, far, more, important, were, the, charges, made, in, the, early, part, of, the, 16th, century, by, the, convert, johannes, pfefferkorn, the, agent, of, the, dominicans, the, result, of, these, accusations, was, a, struggle, in, which, the, emperor, and, the, pope, acted, as, judges, the, advocate, of, the, jews, being, johann, reuchlin, who, was, opposed, by, the, obscurantists, and, this, controversy, which, was, carried, on, for, the, most, part, by, means, of, pamphlets, became, in, the, eyes, of, some, a, precursor, of, the, reformation, an, unexpected, result, of, this, affair, was, the, complete, printed, edition, of, the, babylonian, talmud, issued, in, 1520, by, daniel, bomberg, at, venice, under, the, protection, of, a, papal, privilege, three, years, later, in, 1523, bomberg, published, the, first, edition, of, the, jerusalem, talmud, after, thirty, years, the, vatican, which, had, first, permitted, the, talmud, to, appear, in, print, undertook, a, campaign, of, destruction, against, it, on, the, new, year, rosh, hashanah, september, 9, 1553, the, copies, of, the, talmud, confiscated, in, compliance, with, a, decree, of, the, inquisition, were, burned, at, rome, in, campo, dei, fiori, auto, de, f, other, burnings, took, place, in, other, italian, cities, such, as, the, one, instigated, by, joshua, dei, cantori, at, cremona, in, 1559, censorship, of, the, talmud, and, other, hebrew, works, was, introduced, by, a, papal, bull, issued, in, 1554, five, years, later, the, talmud, was, included, in, the, first, index, expurgatorius, and, pope, pius, iv, commanded, in, 1565, that, the, talmud, be, deprived, of, its, very, name, the, convention, of, referring, to, the, work, as, shas, shishah, sidre, mishnah, instead, of, talmud, dates, from, this, time, the, first, edition, of, the, expurgated, talmud, on, which, most, subsequent, editions, were, based, appeared, at, basel, 1578, 1581, with, the, omission, of, the, entire, treatise, of, abodah, zarah, and, of, passages, considered, inimical, to, christianity, together, with, modifications, of, certain, phrases, a, fresh, attack, on, the, talmud, was, decreed, by, pope, gregory, xiii, 1575, 85, and, in, 1593, clement, viii, renewed, the, old, interdiction, against, reading, or, owning, it, the, increasing, study, of, the, talmud, in, poland, led, to, the, issue, of, a, complete, edition, krak, w, 1602, 05, with, a, restoration, of, the, original, text, an, edition, containing, so, far, as, known, only, two, treatises, had, previously, been, published, at, lublin, 1559, 76, after, an, attack, on, the, talmud, took, place, in, poland, in, what, is, now, ukrainian, territory, in, 1757, when, bishop, dembowski, at, the, instigation, of, the, frankists, convened, a, public, disputation, at, kamieniec, podolski, and, ordered, all, copies, of, the, work, found, in, his, bishopric, to, be, confiscated, and, burned, a, 1735, edition, of, moed, katan, printed, in, frankfurt, am, oder, is, among, those, that, survived, from, that, era, situated, on, the, oder, river, three, separate, editions, of, the, talmud, were, printed, there, between, 1697, and, 1739, the, external, history, of, the, talmud, includes, also, the, literary, attacks, made, upon, it, by, some, christian, theologians, after, the, reformation, since, these, onslaughts, on, judaism, were, directed, primarily, against, that, work, the, leading, example, being, eisenmenger, s, entdecktes, judenthum, judaism, unmasked, 1700, in, contrast, the, talmud, was, a, subject, of, rather, more, sympathetic, study, by, many, christian, theologians, jurists, and, orientalists, from, the, renaissance, on, including, johann, reuchlin, john, selden, petrus, cunaeus, john, lightfoot, and, johannes, buxtorf, father, and, son, the, vilna, edition, of, the, talmud, was, subject, to, russian, government, censorship, or, self, censorship, to, meet, government, expectations, though, this, was, less, severe, than, some, previous, attempts, the, title, talmud, was, retained, and, the, tractate, avodah, zarah, was, included, most, modern, editions, are, either, copies, of, or, closely, based, on, the, vilna, edition, and, therefore, still, omit, most, of, the, disputed, passages, although, they, were, not, available, for, many, generations, the, removed, sections, of, the, talmud, rashi, tosafot, and, maharsha, were, preserved, through, rare, printings, of, lists, of, errata, known, as, chesronos, hashas, omissions, of, the, talmud, many, of, these, censored, portions, were, recovered, from, uncensored, manuscripts, in, the, vatican, library, some, modern, editions, of, the, talmud, contain, some, or, all, of, this, material, either, at, the, back, of, the, book, in, the, margin, or, in, its, original, location, in, the, text, in, 1830, during, a, debate, in, the, french, chamber, of, peers, regarding, state, recognition, of, the, jewish, faith, admiral, verhuell, declared, himself, unable, to, forgive, the, jews, whom, he, had, met, during, his, travels, throughout, the, world, either, for, their, refusal, to, recognize, jesus, as, the, messiah, or, for, their, possession, of, the, talmud, in, the, same, year, the, abb, chiarini, published, a, voluminous, work, entitled, th, orie, du, juda, sme, in, which, he, announced, a, translation, of, the, talmud, advocating, for, the, first, time, a, version, that, would, make, the, work, generally, accessible, and, thus, serve, for, attacks, on, judaism, only, two, out, of, the, projected, six, volumes, of, this, translation, appeared, in, a, like, spirit, 19th, century, antisemitic, agitators, often, urged, that, a, translation, be, made, and, this, demand, was, even, brought, before, legislative, bodies, as, in, vienna, the, talmud, and, the, talmud, jew, thus, became, objects, of, antisemitic, attacks, for, example, in, august, rohling, s, der, talmudjude, 1871, although, on, the, other, hand, they, were, defended, by, many, christian, students, of, the, talmud, notably, hermann, strack, further, attacks, from, antisemitic, sources, include, justinas, pranaitis, the, talmud, unmasked, the, secret, rabbinical, teachings, concerning, christians, 1892, and, elizabeth, dilling, s, the, plot, against, christianity, 1964, the, criticisms, of, the, talmud, in, many, modern, pamphlets, and, websites, are, often, recognizable, as, verbatim, quotations, from, one, or, other, of, these, historians, will, and, ariel, durant, noted, a, lack, of, consistency, between, the, many, authors, of, the, talmud, with, some, tractates, in, the, wrong, order, or, subjects, dropped, and, resumed, without, reason, according, to, the, durants, the, talmud, is, not, the, product, of, deliberation, it, is, the, deliberation, itself, the, internet, is, another, source, of, criticism, of, the, talmud, the, anti, defamation, league, s, report, on, this, topic, states, that, antisemitic, critics, of, the, talmud, frequently, use, erroneous, translations, or, selective, quotations, in, order, to, distort, the, meaning, of, the, talmud, s, text, and, sometimes, fabricate, passages, in, addition, the, critics, rarely, provide, the, full, context, of, the, quotations, and, fail, to, provide, contextual, information, about, the, culture, that, the, talmud, was, composed, in, nearly, 2, 000, years, ago, one, such, example, concerns, the, line, if, a, jew, be, called, upon, to, explain, any, part, of, the, rabbinic, books, he, ought, to, give, only, a, false, explanation, one, who, transgresses, this, commandment, will, be, put, to, death, this, is, alleged, to, be, a, quote, from, a, book, titled, libbre, david, alternatively, livore, david, no, such, book, exists, in, the, talmud, or, elsewhere, the, title, is, assumed, to, be, a, corruption, of, dibre, david, a, work, published,
