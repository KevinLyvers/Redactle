philosophy, of, religion, is, the, philosophical, examination, of, the, central, themes, and, concepts, involved, in, religious, traditions, philosophical, discussions, on, such, topics, date, from, ancient, times, and, appear, in, the, earliest, known, texts, concerning, philosophy, the, field, involves, many, other, branches, of, philosophy, including, metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, aesthetics, philosophy, of, language, and, philosophy, of, science, the, philosophy, of, religion, differs, from, religious, philosophy, in, that, it, seeks, to, discuss, questions, regarding, the, nature, of, religion, as, a, whole, rather, than, examining, the, problems, brought, forth, by, a, particular, belief, system, the, philosophy, of, religion, differs, from, theology, in, that, it, aims, to, examine, religious, concepts, from, an, objective, philosophical, perspective, rather, than, from, the, perspective, of, a, specific, religious, tradition, the, philosophy, of, religion, also, differs, from, religious, studies, in, that, it, seeks, to, evaluate, the, truth, of, religious, worldviews, it, can, be, carried, out, dispassionately, by, those, who, identify, as, believers, or, non, believers, philosopher, william, l, rowe, characterized, the, philosophy, of, religion, as, the, critical, examination, of, basic, religious, beliefs, and, concepts, philosophy, of, religion, covers, alternative, beliefs, about, god, gods, demons, spirits, or, all, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, the, interplay, between, science, and, religion, the, nature, and, scope, of, good, and, evil, and, religious, treatments, of, birth, history, and, death, the, field, also, includes, the, ethical, implications, of, religious, commitments, the, relation, between, faith, reason, experience, and, tradition, concepts, of, the, miraculous, the, sacred, revelation, mysticism, power, and, salvation, the, term, philosophy, of, religion, did, not, come, into, general, use, in, the, west, until, the, nineteenth, century, and, most, pre, modern, and, early, modern, philosophical, works, included, a, mixture, of, religious, themes, and, non, religious, philosophical, questions, in, asia, examples, include, texts, such, as, the, hindu, upanishads, the, works, of, daoism, and, confucianism, and, buddhist, texts, greek, philosophies, like, pythagoreanism, and, stoicism, included, religious, elements, and, theories, about, deities, and, medieval, philosophy, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, big, three, monotheistic, abrahamic, religions, in, the, western, world, early, modern, philosophers, such, as, thomas, hobbes, john, locke, and, george, berkeley, discussed, religious, topics, alongside, secular, philosophical, issues, as, well, the, philosophy, of, religion, has, been, distinguished, from, theology, by, pointing, out, that, for, theology, its, critical, reflections, are, based, on, religious, convictions, also, theology, is, responsible, to, an, authority, that, initiates, its, thinking, speaking, and, witnessing, philosophy, bases, its, arguments, on, the, ground, of, timeless, evidence, some, aspects, of, philosophy, of, religion, have, classically, been, regarded, as, a, part, of, metaphysics, in, aristotle, s, metaphysics, the, necessarily, prior, cause, of, eternal, motion, was, an, unmoved, mover, who, like, the, object, of, desire, or, of, thought, inspires, motion, without, itself, being, moved, today, however, philosophers, have, adopted, the, term, philosophy, of, religion, for, the, subject, and, typically, it, is, regarded, as, a, separate, field, of, specialization, although, it, is, also, still, treated, by, some, particularly, catholic, philosophers, as, a, part, of, metaphysics, different, religions, have, different, ideas, about, ultimate, reality, its, source, or, ground, or, lack, thereof, and, also, about, what, is, the, maximal, greatness, paul, tillich, s, concept, of, ultimate, concern, and, rudolf, otto, s, idea, of, the, holy, are, concepts, which, point, to, concerns, about, the, ultimate, or, highest, truth, which, most, religious, philosophies, deal, with, in, some, way, one, of, the, main, differences, among, religions, is, whether, the, ultimate, reality, is, a, personal, god, or, an, impersonal, reality, in, western, religions, various, forms, of, theism, are, the, most, common, conceptions, while, in, eastern, religions, there, are, theistic, and, also, various, non, theistic, conceptions, of, the, ultimate, theistic, vs, non, theistic, is, a, common, way, of, sorting, the, different, types, of, religions, there, are, also, several, philosophical, positions, with, regard, to, the, existence, of, god, that, one, might, take, including, various, forms, of, theism, such, as, monotheism, and, polytheism, agnosticism, and, different, forms, of, atheism, keith, yandell, outlines, roughly, three, kinds, of, historical, monotheisms, greek, semitic, and, hindu, greek, monotheism, holds, that, the, world, has, always, existed, and, does, not, believe, in, creationism, or, divine, providence, while, semitic, monotheism, believes, the, world, was, created, by, a, god, at, a, particular, point, in, time, and, that, this, god, acts, in, the, world, indian, monotheism, teaches, that, the, world, is, beginningless, but, that, there, is, god, s, act, of, creation, which, sustains, the, world, the, attempt, to, provide, proofs, or, arguments, for, the, existence, of, god, is, one, aspect, of, what, is, known, as, natural, theology, or, the, natural, theistic, project, this, strand, of, natural, theology, attempts, to, justify, belief, in, god, by, independent, grounds, perhaps, most, of, the, philosophy, of, religion, is, predicated, on, natural, theology, s, assumption, that, the, existence, of, god, can, be, justified, or, warranted, on, rational, grounds, there, has, been, considerable, philosophical, and, theological, debate, about, the, kinds, of, proofs, justifications, and, arguments, that, are, appropriate, for, this, discourse, eastern, religions, have, included, both, theistic, and, other, alternative, positions, about, the, ultimate, nature, of, reality, one, such, view, is, jainism, which, holds, a, dualistic, view, that, all, that, exists, is, matter, and, a, multiplicity, of, souls, jiva, without, depending, on, a, supreme, deity, for, their, existence, there, are, also, different, buddhist, views, such, as, the, theravada, abhidharma, view, which, holds, that, the, only, ultimately, existing, things, are, transitory, phenomenal, events, dharmas, and, their, interdependent, relations, madhyamaka, buddhists, such, as, nagarjuna, hold, that, ultimate, reality, is, emptiness, shunyata, while, the, yogacara, holds, that, it, is, vij, apti, mental, phenomena, in, indian, philosophical, discourses, monotheism, was, defended, by, hindu, philosophers, particularly, the, nyaya, school, while, buddhist, thinkers, argued, against, their, conception, of, a, creator, god, sanskrit, ishvara, the, hindu, view, of, advaita, vedanta, as, defended, by, adi, shankara, is, a, total, non, dualism, although, advaitins, do, believe, in, the, usual, hindu, gods, their, view, of, ultimate, reality, is, a, radically, monistic, oneness, brahman, without, qualities, and, anything, which, appears, like, persons, and, gods, is, illusory, maya, the, various, philosophical, positions, of, taoism, can, also, be, viewed, as, non, theistic, about, the, ultimate, reality, tao, taoist, philosophers, have, conceived, of, different, ways, of, describing, the, ultimate, nature, of, things, for, example, while, the, taoist, xuanxue, thinker, wang, bi, argued, that, everything, is, rooted, in, wu, non, being, nothingness, guo, xiang, rejected, wu, as, the, ultimate, source, of, things, instead, arguing, that, the, ultimate, nature, of, the, tao, is, spontaneous, self, production, zi, sheng, and, spontaneous, self, transformation, zi, hua, traditionally, jains, and, buddhists, did, not, rule, out, the, existence, of, limited, deities, or, divine, beings, they, only, rejected, the, idea, of, a, single, all, powerful, creator, god, or, first, cause, posited, by, monotheists, all, religious, traditions, make, knowledge, claims, which, they, argue, are, central, to, religious, practice, and, to, the, ultimate, solution, to, the, main, problem, of, human, life, these, include, epistemic, metaphysical, and, ethical, claims, evidentialism, is, the, position, that, may, be, characterized, as, a, belief, is, rationally, justified, only, if, there, is, sufficient, evidence, for, it, many, theists, and, non, theists, are, evidentialists, for, example, aquinas, and, bertrand, russell, agree, that, belief, in, god, is, rational, only, if, there, is, sufficient, evidence, but, disagree, on, whether, such, evidence, exists, these, arguments, often, stipulate, that, subjective, religious, experiences, are, not, reasonable, evidence, and, thus, religious, truths, must, be, argued, based, on, non, religious, evidence, one, of, the, strongest, positions, of, evidentialism, is, that, by, william, kingdon, clifford, who, wrote, it, is, wrong, always, everywhere, and, for, anyone, to, believe, anything, upon, insufficient, evidence, his, view, of, evidentialism, is, usually, read, in, tandem, with, william, james, s, article, a, will, to, believe, 1896, which, argues, against, clifford, s, principle, more, recent, supporters, of, evidentialism, include, antony, flew, the, presumption, of, atheism, 1972, and, michael, scriven, primary, philosophy, 1966, both, of, them, rely, on, the, ockhamist, view, that, in, the, absence, of, evidence, for, x, belief, in, x, is, not, justified, many, modern, thomists, are, also, evidentialists, in, that, they, hold, they, can, demonstrate, there, is, evidence, for, the, belief, in, god, another, move, is, to, argue, in, a, bayesian, way, for, the, probability, of, a, religious, truth, like, god, not, for, total, conclusive, evidence, some, philosophers, however, argue, that, religious, belief, is, warranted, without, evidence, and, hence, are, sometimes, called, non, evidentialists, they, include, fideists, and, reformed, epistemologists, alvin, plantinga, and, other, reformed, epistemologists, are, examples, of, philosophers, who, argue, that, religious, beliefs, are, properly, basic, beliefs, and, that, it, is, not, irrational, to, hold, them, even, though, they, are, not, supported, by, any, evidence, the, rationale, here, is, that, some, beliefs, we, hold, must, be, foundational, and, not, be, based, on, further, rational, beliefs, if, this, is, not, so, then, we, risk, an, infinite, regress, this, is, qualified, by, the, proviso, that, they, can, be, defended, against, objections, this, differentiates, this, view, from, fideism, a, properly, basic, belief, is, a, belief, that, one, can, reasonably, hold, without, evidence, such, as, a, memory, a, basic, sensation, or, a, perception, plantinga, s, argument, is, that, belief, in, god, is, of, this, type, because, within, every, human, mind, there, is, a, natural, awareness, of, divinity, william, james, in, his, essay, the, will, to, believe, argues, for, a, pragmatic, conception, of, religious, belief, for, james, religious, belief, is, justified, if, one, is, presented, with, a, question, which, is, rationally, undecidable, and, if, one, is, presented, with, genuine, and, live, options, which, are, relevant, for, the, individual, for, james, religious, belief, is, defensible, because, of, the, pragmatic, value, it, can, bring, to, one, s, life, even, if, there, is, no, rational, evidence, for, it, some, work, in, recent, epistemology, of, religion, goes, beyond, debates, over, evidentialism, fideism, and, reformed, epistemology, to, consider, contemporary, issues, deriving, from, new, ideas, about, knowledge, how, and, practical, skill, how, practical, factors, can, affect, whether, one, could, know, whether, theism, is, true, from, formal, epistemology, s, use, of, probability, theory, or, from, social, epistemology, particularly, the, epistemology, of, testimony, or, the, epistemology, of, disagreement, for, example, an, important, topic, in, the, epistemology, of, religion, is, that, of, religious, disagreement, and, the, issue, of, what, it, means, for, intelligent, individuals, of, the, same, epistemic, parity, to, disagree, about, religious, issues, religious, disagreement, has, been, seen, as, possibly, posing, first, order, or, higher, order, problems, for, religious, belief, a, first, order, problem, refers, to, whether, that, evidence, directly, applies, to, the, truth, of, any, religious, proposition, while, a, higher, order, problem, instead, applies, to, whether, one, has, rationally, assessed, the, first, order, evidence, one, example, of, a, first, order, problem, is, the, argument, from, nonbelief, higher, order, discussions, focus, on, whether, religious, disagreement, with, epistemic, peers, someone, whose, epistemic, ability, is, equal, to, our, own, demands, us, to, adopt, a, skeptical, or, agnostic, stance, or, whether, to, reduce, or, change, our, religious, beliefs, while, religions, resort, to, rational, arguments, to, attempt, to, establish, their, views, they, also, claim, that, religious, belief, is, at, least, partially, to, be, accepted, through, faith, confidence, or, trust, in, one, s, religious, belief, there, are, different, conceptions, or, models, of, faith, including, there, are, also, different, positions, on, how, faith, relates, to, reason, one, example, is, the, belief, that, faith, and, reason, are, compatible, and, work, together, which, is, the, view, of, thomas, aquinas, and, the, orthodox, view, of, catholic, natural, theology, according, to, this, view, reason, establishes, certain, religious, truths, and, faith, guided, by, reason, gives, us, access, to, truths, about, the, divine, which, according, to, aquinas, exceed, all, the, ability, of, human, reason, another, position, on, is, fideism, the, view, that, faith, is, in, some, sense, independent, of, if, not, outright, adversarial, toward, reason, modern, philosophers, such, as, kierkegaard, william, james, and, wittgenstein, have, been, associated, with, this, label, kierkegaard, in, particular, argued, for, the, necessity, of, the, religious, to, take, a, non, rational, leap, of, faith, to, bridge, the, gulf, between, man, and, god, wittgensteinian, fideism, meanwhile, sees, religious, language, games, as, being, incommensurate, with, scientific, and, metaphysical, language, games, and, that, they, are, autonomous, and, thus, may, only, be, judged, on, their, own, standards, the, obvious, criticism, to, this, is, that, many, religions, clearly, put, forth, metaphysical, claims, several, contemporary, new, atheist, writers, which, are, hostile, to, religion, hold, a, related, view, that, says, that, religious, claims, and, scientific, claims, are, opposed, to, each, other, and, that, therefore, religions, are, false, the, protestant, theologian, karl, barth, 1886, 1968, argued, that, religious, believers, have, no, need, to, prove, their, beliefs, through, reason, and, thus, rejected, the, project, of, natural, theology, according, to, barth, human, reason, is, corrupt, and, god, is, utterly, different, from, his, creatures, thus, we, can, only, rely, on, god, s, own, revelation, for, religious, knowledge, barth, s, view, has, been, termed, neo, orthodoxy, similarly, d, z, phillips, argues, that, god, is, not, intelligible, through, reason, or, evidence, because, god, is, not, an, empirical, object, or, a, being, among, beings, as, brian, davies, points, out, the, problem, with, positions, like, barth, s, is, that, they, do, not, help, us, in, deciding, between, inconsistent, and, competing, revelations, of, the, different, religions, the, topic, of, whether, religious, beliefs, are, compatible, with, science, and, in, what, way, is, also, another, important, topic, in, the, philosophy, of, religion, as, well, as, in, theology, this, field, draws, the, historical, study, of, their, interactions, and, conflicts, such, as, the, debates, in, the, united, states, over, the, teaching, of, evolution, and, creationism, there, are, different, models, of, interaction, that, have, been, discussed, in, the, philosophical, literature, including, the, field, also, draws, the, scientific, study, of, religion, particularly, by, psychologists, and, sociologists, as, well, as, cognitive, scientists, various, theories, about, religion, have, arisen, from, these, various, disciplines, one, example, is, the, various, evolutionary, theories, of, religion, which, see, the, phenomenon, as, either, adaptive, or, a, by, product, another, can, be, seen, in, the, various, theories, put, forth, by, the, cognitive, science, of, religion, some, argued, that, evolutionary, or, cognitive, theories, undermine, religious, belief, closely, related, to, knowledge, and, belief, is, how, to, interpret, religious, experiences, and, their, potential, for, providing, knowledge, religious, experiences, have, been, recorded, throughout, all, cultures, and, are, widely, diverse, these, personal, experiences, tend, to, be, highly, important, to, individuals, who, undergo, them, discussions, about, religious, experiences, can, be, said, to, be, informed, in, part, by, the, question, what, sort, of, information, about, what, there, is, might, religious, experience, provide, and, how, could, one, tell, one, could, interpret, these, experiences, either, veridically, neutrally, or, as, delusions, both, monotheistic, and, non, monotheistic, religious, thinkers, and, mystics, have, appealed, to, religious, experiences, as, evidence, for, their, claims, about, ultimate, reality, philosophers, such, as, richard, swinburne, and, william, alston, have, compared, religious, experiences, to, everyday, perceptions, that, is, both, are, noetic, and, have, a, perceptual, object, and, thus, religious, experiences, could, logically, be, veridical, unless, we, have, a, good, reason, to, disbelieve, them, other, philosophers, such, as, eleonore, stump, and, matthew, benton, argue, for, an, interpersonal, epistemology, on, which, one, can, experience, and, know, god, in, a, relational, or, personal, sense, according, to, brian, davies, common, objections, against, the, veridical, force, of, religious, experiences, include, the, fact, that, experience, is, frequently, deceptive, and, that, people, who, claim, an, experience, of, a, god, may, be, mistakenly, identifying, an, object, of, their, experience, or, be, insane, or, hallucinating, however, he, argues, that, we, cannot, deduce, from, the, fact, that, our, experiences, are, sometimes, mistaken, hallucinations, or, distorted, to, the, conclusion, that, all, religious, experiences, are, mistaken, etc, indeed, a, drunken, or, hallucinating, person, could, still, perceive, things, correctly, therefore, these, objections, cannot, be, said, to, necessarily, disprove, all, religious, experiences, according, to, c, b, martin, there, are, no, tests, agreed, upon, to, establish, genuine, experience, of, god, and, distinguish, it, decisively, from, the, ungenuine, and, therefore, all, that, religious, experiences, can, establish, is, the, reality, of, these, psychological, states, naturalistic, explanations, for, religious, experiences, are, often, seen, as, undermining, their, epistemic, value, explanations, such, as, the, fear, of, death, suggestion, infantile, regression, sexual, frustration, neurological, anomalies, it, s, all, in, the, head, as, well, as, the, socio, political, power, that, having, such, experiences, might, grant, to, a, mystic, have, been, put, forward, more, recently, some, argued, that, religious, experiences, are, caused, by, cognitive, misattributions, akin, to, hallucinations, although, this, was, denied, by, others, a, contrary, position, was, taken, by, bertrand, russell, who, compared, the, veridical, value, of, religious, experiences, to, the, hallucinations, of, a, drunk, person, from, a, scientific, point, of, view, we, can, make, no, distinction, between, the, man, who, eats, little, and, sees, heaven, and, the, man, who, drinks, much, and, sees, snakes, each, is, in, an, abnormal, physical, condition, and, therefore, has, abnormal, perceptions, however, as, william, l, rowe, notes, the, hidden, assumption, in, russell, s, argument, is, that, bodily, and, mental, states, that, interfere, with, reliable, perceptions, of, the, physical, world, also, interfere, with, reliable, perceptions, of, a, spiritual, world, beyond, the, physical, if, there, is, such, a, spiritual, world, to, be, perceived, perhaps, this, assumption, is, reasonable, but, it, certainly, is, not, obviously, true, in, other, words, as, argued, by, c, d, broad, one, might, need, to, be, slightly, cracked, or, at, least, appear, to, be, mentally, and, physically, abnormal, in, order, to, perceive, the, supranormal, spiritual, world, william, james, meanwhile, takes, a, middle, course, between, accepting, mystical, experiences, as, veridical, or, seeing, them, as, delusional, he, argues, that, for, the, individual, who, experiences, them, they, are, authoritative, and, they, break, down, the, authority, of, the, rational, mind, not, only, that, but, according, to, james, the, mystic, is, justified, in, this, but, when, it, comes, to, the, non, mystic, the, outside, observer, they, have, no, reason, to, regard, them, as, either, veridical, nor, delusive, the, study, of, religious, experiences, from, the, perspective, of, the, field, of, phenomenology, has, also, been, a, feature, of, the, philosophy, of, religion, key, thinkers, in, this, field, include, william, brede, kristensen, and, gerard, van, der, leeuw, just, like, there, are, different, religions, there, are, different, forms, of, religious, experience, one, could, have, subject, content, experiences, such, as, a, euphoric, meditative, state, and, subject, consciousness, object, experiences, such, as, the, perception, of, having, seen, a, god, i, e, theophany, experiences, of, theophany, are, described, in, ancient, mediterranean, religious, works, and, myths, and, include, the, story, of, semele, who, died, due, to, her, seeing, zeus, and, the, biblical, story, of, the, burning, bush, indian, texts, like, the, bhagavad, gita, also, contain, theophanic, events, the, diversity, sometimes, to, the, point, of, contradiction, of, religious, experiences, has, also, been, used, as, an, argument, against, their, veridical, nature, and, as, evidence, that, they, are, a, purely, subjective, psychological, phenomenon, in, western, thought, religious, experience, mainly, a, theistic, one, has, been, described, by, the, likes, of, friedrich, schleiermacher, rudolf, otto, and, william, james, according, to, schleiermacher, the, distinguishing, feature, of, a, religious, experience, is, that, one, is, overcome, by, the, feeling, of, absolute, dependence, otto, meanwhile, argued, that, while, this, was, an, important, element, the, most, basic, feature, of, religious, experiences, is, that, it, is, numinous, he, described, this, as, non, rational, non, sensory, experience, or, feeling, whose, primary, and, immediate, object, is, outside, the, self, as, well, as, having, the, qualities, of, being, a, mystery, terrifying, and, fascinating, rowe, meanwhile, defined, a, religious, experience, as, an, experience, in, which, one, senses, the, immediate, presence, of, the, divine, according, to, rowe, religious, experiences, can, be, divided, in, the, following, manner, non, monotheistic, religions, meanwhile, also, report, different, experiences, from, theophany, such, as, non, dual, experiences, of, oneness, and, deeply, focused, meditative, states, termed, samadhi, in, indian, religion, as, well, as, experiences, of, enlightenment, in, buddhism, liberation, in, hinduism, and, kevala, in, jainism, another, typology, offered, by, chad, meister, differentiates, between, three, major, experiences, another, debate, on, this, topic, is, whether, all, religious, cultures, share, common, core, mystical, experiences, perennialism, or, whether, these, experiences, are, in, some, way, socially, and, culturally, constructed, constructivism, or, contextualism, according, to, walter, stace, all, cultures, share, mystical, experiences, of, oneness, with, the, external, world, as, well, as, introverted, pure, conscious, events, which, is, empty, of, all, concepts, thoughts, qualities, etc, except, pure, consciousness, similarly, ninian, smart, argued, that, monistic, experiences, were, universal, perennialists, tend, to, distinguish, between, the, experience, itself, and, its, post, experience, interpretation, to, make, sense, of, the, different, views, in, world, religions, some, constructivists, like, steven, t, katz, meanwhile, have, argued, against, the, common, core, thesis, and, for, either, the, view, that, every, mystical, experience, contains, at, least, some, concepts, soft, constructivism, or, that, they, are, strongly, shaped, and, determined, by, one, s, religious, ideas, and, culture, hard, constructivism, in, this, view, the, conceptual, scheme, of, any, mystic, strongly, shapes, their, experiences, and, because, mystics, from, different, religions, have, very, different, schemas, there, cannot, be, any, universal, mystical, experiences, all, religions, argue, for, certain, values, and, ideas, of, the, moral, good, non, monotheistic, indian, traditions, like, buddhism, and, advaita, vedanta, find, the, highest, good, in, nirvana, or, moksha, which, leads, to, release, from, suffering, and, the, rounds, of, rebirth, and, morality, is, a, means, to, achieve, this, while, for, monotheistic, traditions, god, is, the, source, or, ground, of, all, morality, and, heaven, in, the, highest, human, good, the, world, religions, also, offer, different, conceptions, of, the, source, of, evil, and, suffering, in, the, world, that, is, what, is, wrong, with, human, life, and, how, to, solve, and, free, ourselves, from, these, dilemmas, for, example, for, christianity, sin, is, the, source, of, human, problems, while, for, buddhism, it, is, craving, and, ignorance, a, general, question, which, philosophy, of, religion, asks, is, what, is, the, relationship, if, any, between, morality, and, religion, brian, davies, outlines, four, possible, theses, monotheistic, religions, who, seek, to, explain, morality, and, its, relationship, to, god, must, deal, with, what, is, termed, the, euthyphro, dilemma, famously, stated, in, the, platonic, dialogue, euthyphro, as, is, the, pious, i, e, what, is, morally, good, loved, by, the, gods, because, it, is, pious, or, is, it, pious, because, it, is, loved, by, the, gods, those, who, hold, that, what, is, moral, is, so, because, it, is, what, god, commands, are, defending, a, version, of, the, divine, command, theory, another, important, topic, which, is, widely, discussed, in, abrahamic, monotheistic, religious, philosophy, is, the, problem, of, human, free, will, and, god, s, omniscience, god, s, omniscience, could, presumably, include, perfect, knowledge, of, the, future, leading, to, theological, determinism, and, thus, possibly, contradicting, with, human, free, will, there, are, different, positions, on, this, including, libertarianism, free, will, is, true, and, predestination, belief, in, miracles, and, supernatural, events, or, occurrences, is, common, among, world, religions, a, miracle, is, an, event, which, cannot, be, explained, by, rational, or, scientific, means, the, resurrection, of, jesus, and, the, miracles, of, muhammad, are, examples, of, miracles, claimed, by, religions, skepticism, towards, the, supernatural, can, be, found, in, early, philosophical, traditions, like, the, indian, carvaka, school, and, greco, roman, philosophers, like, lucretius, david, hume, who, defined, a, miracle, as, a, violation, of, the, laws, of, nature, famously, argued, against, miracles, in, of, miracles, section, x, of, an, enquiry, concerning, human, understanding, 1748, for, hume, the, probability, that, a, miracle, has, not, occurred, is, always, greater, than, the, probability, that, it, has, because, as, a, firm, and, unalterable, experience, has, established, these, laws, the, proof, against, a, miracle, from, the, very, nature, of, the, fact, is, as, entire, as, any, argument, from, experience, can, possibly, be, imagined, enquiry, x, p, 173, hume, does, not, argue, that, a, miracle, is, impossible, only, that, it, is, unreasonable, to, believe, in, any, testimony, of, a, miracle, s, occurrence, for, evidence, for, the, regularity, of, natural, laws, is, much, stronger, than, human, testimony, which, is, often, in, error, according, to, rowe, there, are, two, weaknesses, with, hume, s, argument, first, there, could, be, other, forms, of, indirect, evidence, for, the, occurrence, of, a, miracle, that, does, not, include, testimony, of, someone, s, direct, experience, of, it, secondly, rowe, argues, that, hume, overestimates, the, weight, that, should, be, given, to, past, experience, in, support, of, some, principle, thought, to, be, a, law, of, nature, for, it, is, a, common, occurrence, that, currently, accepted, ideas, of, natural, laws, are, revised, due, to, an, observed, exception, but, hume, s, argument, would, lead, one, to, conclude, that, these, exceptions, do, not, occur, rowe, adds, that, it, remains, true, however, that, a, reasonable, person, will, require, quite, strong, evidence, before, believing, that, a, law, of, nature, has, been, violated, it, is, easy, to, believe, the, person, who, claimed, to, see, water, run, downhill, but, quite, difficult, to, believe, that, someone, saw, water, run, uphill, another, definition, of, a, miracle, is, possible, however, which, is, termed, the, epistemic, theory, of, miracles, and, was, argued, for, by, spinoza, and, st, augustine, this, view, rejects, that, a, miracle, is, a, transgression, of, natural, laws, but, is, simply, a, transgression, of, our, current, understanding, of, natural, law, in, the, tractatus, theologico, politicus, spinoza, writes, miracles, are, only, intelligible, as, in, relation, to, human, opinions, and, merely, mean, events, of, which, the, natural, cause, cannot, be, explained, by, a, reference, to, any, ordinary, occurrence, either, by, us, or, at, any, rate, by, the, writer, and, narrator, of, the, miracle, tractatus, p, 84, similarly, r, f, holland, has, defined, miracle, in, a, naturalistic, way, in, a, widely, cited, paper, for, holland, a, miracle, need, only, be, an, extraordinary, and, beneficial, coincidence, interpreted, religiously, brian, davies, notes, that, even, if, we, can, establish, that, a, miracle, has, occurred, it, is, hard, to, see, what, this, is, supposed, to, prove, for, it, is, possible, that, they, arise, due, to, agencies, which, are, unusual, and, powerful, but, not, divine, world, religions, put, forth, various, theories, which, affirm, life, after, death, and, different, kinds, of, postmortem, existence, this, is, often, tied, to, belief, in, an, immortal, individual, soul, or, self, sanskrit, atman, separate, from, the, body, which, survives, death, as, defended, by, plato, descartes, monotheistic, religions, like, christianity, and, many, indian, philosophers, this, view, is, also, a, position, on, the, mind, body, problem, mainly, dualism, this, view, then, must, show, not, only, that, dualism, is, true, and, that, souls, exist, but, also, that, souls, survive, death, as, kant, famously, argued, the, mere, existence, of, a, soul, does, not, prove, its, immortality, for, one, could, conceive, that, a, soul, even, if, it, is, totally, simple, could, still, fade, away, or, lose, its, intensity, h, h, price, is, one, modern, philosopher, who, has, speculated, at, length, about, what, it, would, be, like, to, be, a, disembodied, soul, after, death, one, major, issue, with, soul, beliefs, is, that, since, personhood, is, closely, tied, to, one, s, physical, body, it, seems, difficult, to, make, sense, of, a, human, being, existing, apart, from, their, body, a, further, issue, is, with, continuity, of, personal, identity, that, is, it, is, not, easy, to, account, for, the, claim, that, the, person, that, exists, after, bodily, death, is, the, same, person, that, existed, before, bertrand, russell, put, forth, the, general, scientific, argument, against, the, afterlife, as, follows, persons, are, part, of, the, everyday, world, with, which, science, is, concerned, and, the, conditions, which, determine, their, existence, are, discoverable, we, know, that, the, brain, is, not, immortal, and, that, the, organized, energy, of, a, living, body, becomes, as, it, were, demobilized, at, death, and, therefore, not, available, for, collective, action, all, the, evidence, goes, to, show, that, what, we, regard, as, our, mental, life, is, bound, up, with, brain, structure, and, organized, bodily, energy, therefore, it, is, rational, to, suppose, that, mental, life, ceases, when, bodily, life, ceases, the, argument, is, only, one, of, probability, but, it, is, as, strong, as, those, upon, which, most, scientific, conclusions, are, based, contra, russell, j, m, e, mctaggart, argues, that, people, have, no, scientific, proof, that, the, mind, is, dependent, on, the, body, in, this, particular, way, as, rowe, notes, the, fact, that, the, mind, depends, on, the, functions, of, the, body, while, one, is, alive, is, not, necessarily, proof, that, the, mind, will, cease, functioning, after, death, just, as, a, person, trapped, in, a, room, while, depending, on, the, windows, to, see, the, outside, world, might, continue, to, see, even, after, the, room, ceases, to, exist, buddhism, is, one, religion, which, while, affirming, postmortem, existence, through, rebirth, denies, the, existence, of, individual, souls, and, instead, affirms, a, deflationary, view, of, personal, identity, termed, not, self, anatta, while, physicalism, has, generally, been, seen, as, hostile, to, notions, of, an, afterlife, this, need, not, be, the, case, abrahamic, religions, like, christianity, have, traditionally, held, that, life, after, death, will, include, the, element, of, bodily, resurrection, one, objection, to, this, view, is, that, it, seems, difficult, to, account, for, personal, continuity, at, best, a, resurrected, body, is, a, replica, of, the, resurrected, person, not, the, same, person, one, response, is, the, constitution, view, of, persons, which, says, persons, are, constituted, by, their, bodies, and, by, a, first, person, perspective, the, capacity, to, think, of, oneself, as, oneself, in, this, view, what, is, resurrected, is, that, first, person, perspective, or, both, the, person, s, body, and, that, perspective, an, objection, to, this, view, is, that, it, seems, difficult, to, differentiate, one, person, s, first, person, perspective, from, another, person, s, without, reference, to, temporal, and, spatial, relations, peter, van, inwagen, meanwhile, offers, the, following, theory, perhaps, at, the, moment, of, each, man, s, death, god, removes, his, corpse, and, replaces, it, with, a, simulacrum, which, is, what, is, burned, or, rots, or, perhaps, god, is, not, quite, so, wholesale, as, this, perhaps, he, removes, for, safekeeping, only, the, core, person, the, brain, and, central, nervous, system, or, even, some, special, part, of, it, these, are, details, van, inwagen, 1992, 245, 46, this, view, shows, how, some, positions, on, the, nature, of, the, afterlife, are, closely, tied, to, and, sometimes, completely, depend, upon, theistic, positions, this, close, connection, between, the, two, views, was, made, by, kant, who, argued, that, one, can, infer, an, afterlife, from, belief, in, a, just, god, who, rewards, persons, for, their, adherence, to, moral, law, other, discussions, on, the, philosophy, of, the, afterlife, deal, with, phenomena, such, as, near, death, experiences, reincarnation, research, and, other, parapsychological, events, and, hinge, on, whether, naturalistic, explanations, for, these, phenomena, is, enough, to, explain, them, or, not, such, discussions, are, associated, with, philosophers, like, william, james, henry, sidgwick, c, d, broad, and, h, h, price, the, issue, of, how, one, is, to, understand, religious, diversity, and, the, plurality, of, religious, views, and, beliefs, has, been, a, central, concern, of, the, philosophy, of, religion, there, are, various, philosophical, positions, regarding, how, one, is, to, make, sense, of, religious, diversity, including, exclusivism, inclusivism, pluralism, relativism, atheism, or, antireligion, and, agnosticism, religious, exclusivism, is, the, claim, that, only, one, religion, is, true, and, that, others, are, wrong, to, say, that, a, religion, is, exclusivistic, can, also, mean, that, salvation, or, human, freedom, is, only, attainable, by, the, followers, of, one, s, religion, this, view, tends, to, be, the, orthodox, view, of, most, monotheistic, religions, such, as, christianity, and, islam, though, liberal, and, modernist, trends, within, them, might, differ, william, l, rowe, outlines, two, problems, with, this, view, the, first, problem, is, that, it, is, easy, to, see, that, if, this, is, true, a, large, portion, of, humanity, is, excluded, from, salvation, and, it, is, hard, to, see, how, a, loving, god, would, desire, this, the, second, problem, is, that, once, we, become, acquainted, with, the, saintly, figures, and, virtuous, people, in, other, religions, it, can, be, difficult, to, see, how, we, could, say, they, are, excluded, from, salvation, just, because, they, are, not, part, of, our, religion, a, different, view, is, inclusivism, which, is, the, idea, that, one, s, own, tradition, alone, has, the, whole, truth, but, that, this, truth, is, nevertheless, partially, reflected, in, other, traditions, an, inclusivist, might, maintain, that, their, religion, is, privileged, they, can, also, hold, that, other, religious, adherents, have, fundamental, truths, and, even, that, they, will, be, saved, or, liberated, the, jain, view, of, anekantavada, many, sidedness, has, been, interpreted, by, some, as, a, tolerant, view, which, is, an, inclusive, acceptance, of, the, partial, truth, value, of, non, jain, religious, ideas, as, paul, dundas, notes, the, jains, ultimately, held, the, thesis, that, jainism, is, the, final, truth, while, other, religions, only, contain, partial, truths, other, scholars, such, as, kristin, beise, kiblinger, have, also, argued, that, some, of, the, buddhist, traditions, include, inclusivist, ideas, and, attitudes, in, the, modern, western, study, of, religion, the, work, of, ninian, smart, has, also, been, instrumental, in, representing, a, more, diverse, understanding, of, religion, and, religious, pluralism, smart, s, view, is, that, there, are, genuine, differences, between, religions, pluralism, is, the, view, that, all, religions, are, equally, valid, responses, to, the, divine, and, that, they, are, all, valid, paths, to, personal, transformation, this, approach, is, taken, by, john, hick, who, has, developed, a, pluralistic, view, which, synthesizes, components, of, various, religious, traditions, hick, promotes, an, idea, of, a, noumenal, sacred, reality, which, different, religions, provide, us, access, to, hick, defines, his, view, as, the, great, world, faiths, embody, different, perceptions, and, conceptions, of, and, correspondingly, different, responses, to, the, real, or, the, ultimate, for, hick, all, religions, are, true, because, they, all, allow, us, to, encounter, the, divine, reality, even, if, they, have, different, deities, and, conceptions, of, it, rowe, notes, that, a, similar, idea, is, proposed, by, paul, tillich, s, concept, of, being, itself, the, view, of, perennialism, is, that, there, is, a, single, or, core, truth, or, experience, which, is, shared, by, all, religions, even, while, they, use, different, terms, and, language, to, express, it, this, view, is, espoused, by, the, likes, of, aldous, huxley, the, thinkers, of, the, traditionalist, school, as, well, as, neo, vedanta, yet, another, way, of, responding, to, the, conflicting, truth, claims, of, religions, is, relativism, joseph, runzo, one, of, its, most, prominent, defenders, has, argued, for, henofideism, which, states, that, the, truth, of, a, religious, worldview, is, relative, to, each, community, of, adherents, thus, while, religions, have, incompatible, views, each, one, is, individually, valid, as, they, emerge, from, individual, experiences, of, a, plurality, of, phenomenal, divine, realities, according, to, runzo, this, view, does, not, reduce, the, incompatible, ideas, and, experiences, of, different, religions, to, mere, interpretations, of, the, real, and, thus, preserves, their, individual, dignity, another, response, to, the, diversity, and, plurality, of, religious, beliefs, and, deities, throughout, human, history, is, one, of, skepticism, towards, all, of, them, or, even, antireligion, seeing, them, as, illusions, or, human, creations, which, serve, human, psychological, needs, sigmund, freud, was, a, famous, proponent, of, this, view, in, various, publications, such, as, the, future, of, an, illusion, 1927, and, civilization, and, its, discontents, 1930, according, to, freud, religion, is, an, illusion, and, it, derives, its, strength, from, the, fact, that, it, falls, in, with, our, instinctual, desires, while, one, can, be, skeptical, towards, the, claims, of, religion, one, need, not, be, hostile, towards, religion, don, cupitt, is, one, example, of, someone, who, while, disbelieving, in, the, metaphysical, and, cosmological, claims, of, his, religion, holds, that, one, can, practice, it, with, a, non, realist, perspective, which, sees, religious, claims, as, human, inventions, and, myths, to, live, by, the, question, of, religious, language, and, in, what, sense, it, can, be, said, to, be, meaningful, has, been, a, central, issue, of, the, philosophy, of, religion, since, the, work, of, the, vienna, circle, a, group, of, philosophers, who, influenced, by, wittgenstein, put, forth, the, theory, of, logical, positivism, their, view, was, that, religious, language, such, as, any, talk, of, god, cannot, be, verified, empirically, and, thus, was, ultimately, meaningless, this, position, has, also, been, termed, theological, noncognitivism, a, similar, view, can, be, seen, in, david, hume, s, an, enquiry, concerning, human, understanding, where, he, famously, wrote, that, any, work, which, did, not, include, either, 1, abstract, reasoning, on, quantity, or, number, or, 2, reasoning, concerning, matter, of, fact, and, existence, was, nothing, but, sophistry, and, illusion, in, a, similar, vein, antony, flew, questioned, the, validity, of, religious, statements, because, they, do, not, seem, to, be, falsifiable, that, is, religious, claims, do, not, seem, to, allow, any, counter, evidence, to, count, against, them, and, thus, they, seem, to, be, lacking, in, content, while, such, arguments, were, popular, in, the, 1950s, and, 60s, the, verification, principle, and, falsifiability, as, a, criterion, for, meaning, are, no, longer, as, widely, held, the, main, problem, with, verificationism, is, that, it, seems, to, be, self, refuting, for, it, is, a, claim, which, does, not, seem, to, be, supported, by, its, own, criterion, as, noted, by, brian, davies, when, talking, about, god, and, religious, truths, religious, traditions, tend, to, resort, to, metaphor, negation, and, analogy, the, via, negativa, has, been, defended, by, thinkers, such, as, maimonides, who, denied, that, positive, statements, about, god, were, helpful, and, wrote, you, will, come, nearer, to, the, knowledge, and, comprehension, of, god, by, the, negative, attributes, similar, approaches, based, on, negation, can, be, seen, in, the, hindu, doctrine, of, neti, neti, and, the, buddhist, philosophy, of, madhyamaka, wittgenstein, s, theory, of, language, games, also, shows, how, one, can, use, analogical, religious, language, to, describe, god, or, religious, truths, even, if, the, words, one, is, using, do, not, in, this, case, refer, to, their, everyday, sense, i, e, when, we, say, god, is, wise, we, do, not, mean, he, is, wise, in, the, same, sense, that, a, person, is, wise, yet, it, can, still, make, sense, to, talk, in, this, manner, however, as, patrick, sherry, notes, the, fact, that, this, sort, of, language, may, make, sense, does, not, mean, that, one, is, warranted, in, ascribing, these, terms, to, god, for, there, must, be, some, connection, between, the, relevant, criteria, we, use, in, ascribing, these, terms, to, conventional, objects, or, subjects, and, to, god, as, chad, meister, notes, though, for, wittgenstein, a, religion, s, language, game, need, not, reflect, some, literal, picture, of, reality, as, a, picture, theory, of, meaning, would, hold, but, is, useful, simply, because, its, ability, to, reflect, the, practices, and, forms, of, life, of, the, various, religious, adherents, following, wittgenstein, philosophers, of, religion, like, norman, malcolm, b, r, tilghman, and, d, z, phillips, have, argued, that, instead, of, seeing, religious, language, as, referring, to, some, objective, reality, we, should, instead, see, it, as, referring, to, forms, of, life, this, approach, is, generally, termed, non, realist, against, this, view, realists, respond, that, non, realism, subverts, religious, belief, and, the, intelligibility, of, religious, practice, it, is, hard, to, see, for, example, how, one, can, pray, to, a, god, without, believing, that, they, really, exist, realists, also, argue, that, non, realism, provides, no, normative, way, to, choose, between, competing, religions, in, analytic, philosophy, of, religion, james, franklin, harris, noted, that, analytic, philosophy, has, been, a, very, heterogeneous, movement, some, forms, of, analytic, philosophy, have, proven, very, sympathetic, to, the, philosophy, of, religion, and, have, actually, provided, a, philosophical, mechanism, for, responding, to, other, more, radical, and, hostile, forms, of, analytic, philosophy, 3, as, with, the, study, of, ethics, early, analytic, philosophy, tended, to, avoid, the, study, of, philosophy, of, religion, largely, dismissing, as, per, the, logical, positivists, view, the, subject, as, part, of, metaphysics, and, therefore, meaningless, the, collapse, of, logical, positivism, renewed, interest, in, philosophy, of, religion, prompting, philosophers, like, william, alston, john, mackie, alvin, plantinga, robert, merrihew, adams, richard, swinburne, and, antony, flew, not, only, to, introduce, new, problems, but, to, re, open, classical, topics, such, as, the, nature, of, miracles, theistic, arguments, the, problem, of, evil, the, rationality, of, belief, in, god, concepts, of, the, nature, of, god, and, many, more, plantinga, mackie, and, flew, debated, the, logical, validity, of, the, free, will, defense, as, a, way, to, solve, the, problem, of, evil, alston, grappling, with, the, consequences, of, analytic, philosophy, of, language, worked, on, the, nature, of, religious, language, adams, worked, on, the, relationship, of, faith, and, morality, analytic, epistemology, and, metaphysics, has, formed, the, basis, for, a, number, of, philosophically, sophisticated, theistic, arguments, like, those, of, the, reformed, epistemologists, like, plantinga, analytic, philosophy, of, religion, has, also, been, preoccupied, with, ludwig, wittgenstein, as, well, as, his, interpretation, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, s, philosophy, of, religion, using, first, hand, remarks, which, would, later, be, published, in, philosophical, investigations, culture, and, value, and, other, works, philosophers, such, as, peter, winch, and, norman, malcolm, developed, what, has, come, to, be, known, as, contemplative, philosophy, a, wittgensteinian, school, of, thought, rooted, in, the, swansea, tradition, and, which, includes, wittgensteinians, such, as, rush, rhees, peter, winch, and, d, z, phillips, among, others, the, name, contemplative, philosophy, was, first, coined, by, d, z, phillips, in, philosophy, s, cool, place, which, rests, on, an, interpretation, of, a, passage, from, wittgenstein, s, culture, and, value, this, interpretation, was, first, labeled, wittgensteinian, fideism, by, kai, nielsen, but, those, who, consider, themselves, wittgensteinians, in, the, swansea, tradition, have, relentlessly, and, repeatedly, rejected, this, construal, as, a, caricature, of, wittgenstein, s, considered, position, this, is, especially, true, of, d, z, phillips, responding, to, this, interpretation, kai, nielsen, and, d, z, phillips, became, two, of, the, most, prominent, philosophers, on, wittgenstein, s, philosophy, of, religion
