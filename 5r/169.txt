paganism, from, classical, latin, p, g, nus, rural, rustic, later, civilian, is, a, term, first, used, in, the, fourth, century, by, early, christians, for, people, in, the, roman, empire, who, practiced, polytheism, or, ethnic, religions, other, than, judaism, in, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, individuals, fell, into, the, pagan, class, either, because, they, were, increasingly, rural, and, provincial, relative, to, the, christian, population, or, because, they, were, not, milites, christi, soldiers, of, christ, alternative, terms, used, in, christian, texts, were, hellene, gentile, and, heathen, ritual, sacrifice, was, an, integral, part, of, ancient, greco, roman, religion, and, was, regarded, as, an, indication, of, whether, a, person, was, pagan, or, christian, paganism, has, broadly, connoted, the, religion, of, the, peasantry, during, and, after, the, middle, ages, the, term, paganism, was, applied, to, any, non, christian, religion, and, the, term, presumed, a, belief, in, false, gods, the, origin, of, the, application, of, the, term, pagan, to, polytheism, is, debated, in, the, 19th, century, paganism, was, adopted, as, a, self, descriptor, by, members, of, various, artistic, groups, inspired, by, the, ancient, world, in, the, 20th, century, it, came, to, be, applied, as, a, self, descriptor, by, practitioners, of, modern, paganism, modern, pagan, movements, and, polytheistic, reconstructionists, modern, pagan, traditions, often, incorporate, beliefs, or, practices, such, as, nature, worship, that, are, different, from, those, of, the, largest, world, religions, contemporary, knowledge, of, old, pagan, religions, and, beliefs, comes, from, several, sources, including, anthropological, field, research, records, the, evidence, of, archaeological, artifacts, and, the, historical, accounts, of, ancient, writers, regarding, cultures, known, to, classical, antiquity, most, modern, pagan, religions, existing, today, express, a, worldview, that, is, pantheistic, panentheistic, polytheistic, or, animistic, but, some, are, monotheistic, it, is, crucial, to, stress, right, from, the, start, that, until, the, 20th, century, people, did, not, call, themselves, pagans, to, describe, the, religion, they, practised, the, notion, of, paganism, as, it, is, generally, understood, today, was, created, by, the, early, christian, church, it, was, a, label, that, christians, applied, to, others, one, of, the, antitheses, that, were, central, to, the, process, of, christian, self, definition, as, such, throughout, history, it, was, generally, used, in, a, derogatory, sense, the, term, pagan, derives, from, late, latin, paganus, revived, during, the, renaissance, itself, deriving, from, classical, latin, pagus, which, originally, meant, region, delimited, by, markers, paganus, had, also, come, to, mean, of, or, relating, to, the, countryside, country, dweller, villager, by, extension, rustic, unlearned, yokel, bumpkin, in, roman, military, jargon, non, combatant, civilian, unskilled, soldier, it, is, related, to, pangere, to, fasten, to, fix, or, affix, and, ultimately, comes, from, proto, indo, european, pag, to, fix, in, the, same, sense, the, adoption, of, paganus, by, the, latin, christians, as, an, all, embracing, pejorative, term, for, polytheists, represents, an, unforeseen, and, singularly, long, lasting, victory, within, a, religious, group, of, a, word, of, latin, slang, originally, devoid, of, religious, meaning, the, evolution, occurred, only, in, the, latin, west, and, in, connection, with, the, latin, church, elsewhere, hellene, or, gentile, ethnikos, remained, the, word, for, pagan, and, paganos, continued, as, a, purely, secular, term, with, overtones, of, the, inferior, and, the, commonplace, medieval, writers, often, assumed, that, paganus, as, a, religious, term, was, a, result, of, the, conversion, patterns, during, the, christianization, of, europe, where, people, in, towns, and, cities, were, converted, more, easily, than, those, in, remote, regions, where, old, ways, tended, to, remain, however, this, idea, has, multiple, problems, first, the, word, s, usage, as, a, reference, to, non, christians, pre, dates, that, period, in, history, second, paganism, within, the, roman, empire, centred, on, cities, the, concept, of, an, urban, christianity, as, opposed, to, a, rural, paganism, would, not, have, occurred, to, romans, during, early, christianity, third, unlike, words, such, as, rusticitas, paganus, had, not, yet, fully, acquired, the, meanings, of, uncultured, backwardness, used, to, explain, why, it, would, have, been, applied, to, pagans, paganus, more, likely, acquired, its, meaning, in, christian, nomenclature, via, roman, military, jargon, see, above, early, christians, adopted, military, motifs, and, saw, themselves, as, milites, christi, soldiers, of, christ, a, good, example, of, christians, still, using, paganus, in, a, military, context, rather, than, a, religious, one, is, in, tertullian, s, de, corona, militis, xi, v, where, the, christian, is, referred, to, as, paganus, civilian, paganus, acquired, its, religious, connotations, by, the, mid, 4th, century, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, paganos, was, metaphorically, used, to, denote, persons, outside, the, bounds, of, the, christian, community, following, the, sack, of, rome, by, the, visigoths, just, over, fifteen, years, after, the, christian, persecution, of, paganism, under, theodosius, i, murmurs, began, to, spread, that, the, old, gods, had, taken, greater, care, of, the, city, than, the, christian, god, in, response, augustine, of, hippo, wrote, de, civitate, dei, contra, paganos, the, city, of, god, against, the, pagans, in, it, he, contrasted, the, fallen, city, of, man, with, the, city, of, god, of, which, all, christians, were, ultimately, citizens, hence, the, foreign, invaders, were, not, of, the, city, or, rural, the, term, pagan, was, not, attested, in, the, english, language, until, the, 17th, century, in, addition, to, infidel, and, heretic, it, was, used, as, one, of, several, pejorative, christian, counterparts, to, goy, as, used, in, judaism, and, to, kafir, unbeliever, and, mushrik, idolater, as, in, islam, in, the, latin, speaking, western, roman, empire, of, the, newly, christianizing, roman, empire, koine, greek, became, associated, with, the, traditional, polytheistic, religion, of, ancient, greece, and, was, regarded, as, a, foreign, language, lingua, peregrina, in, the, west, by, the, latter, half, of, the, 4th, century, in, the, greek, speaking, eastern, empire, pagans, were, paradoxically, most, commonly, called, hellenes, lit, greeks, the, word, had, almost, entirely, ceased, being, used, in, a, cultural, sense, it, retained, that, meaning, for, roughly, the, first, millennium, of, christianity, this, was, influenced, by, christianity, s, early, members, who, were, jewish, the, jews, of, the, time, distinguished, themselves, from, foreigners, according, to, religion, rather, than, ethno, cultural, standards, and, early, jewish, christians, would, have, done, the, same, since, hellenic, culture, was, the, dominant, pagan, culture, in, the, roman, east, they, referred, to, pagans, as, hellenes, christianity, inherited, jewish, terminology, for, non, jews, and, adapted, it, in, order, to, refer, to, non, christians, with, whom, they, were, in, contact, this, usage, is, recorded, in, the, new, testament, in, the, pauline, epistles, hellene, is, almost, always, juxtaposed, with, hebrew, regardless, of, actual, ethnicity, the, usage, of, hellene, as, a, religious, term, was, initially, part, of, an, exclusively, christian, nomenclature, but, some, pagans, began, to, defiantly, call, themselves, hellenes, other, pagans, even, preferred, the, narrow, meaning, of, the, word, from, a, broad, cultural, sphere, to, a, more, specific, religious, grouping, however, there, were, many, christians, and, pagans, alike, who, strongly, objected, to, the, evolution, of, the, terminology, the, influential, archbishop, of, constantinople, gregory, of, nazianzus, for, example, took, offence, at, imperial, efforts, to, suppress, hellenic, culture, especially, concerning, spoken, and, written, greek, and, he, openly, criticized, the, emperor, the, growing, religious, stigmatization, of, hellenism, had, a, chilling, effect, on, hellenic, culture, by, the, late, 4th, century, by, late, antiquity, however, it, was, possible, to, speak, greek, as, a, primary, language, while, not, conceiving, of, oneself, as, a, hellene, the, long, established, use, of, greek, both, in, and, around, the, eastern, roman, empire, as, a, lingua, franca, ironically, allowed, it, to, instead, become, central, in, enabling, the, spread, of, christianity, as, indicated, for, example, by, the, use, of, greek, for, the, epistles, of, paul, in, the, first, half, of, the, 5th, century, greek, was, the, standard, language, in, which, bishops, communicated, and, the, acta, conciliorum, acts, of, the, church, councils, were, recorded, originally, in, greek, and, then, translated, into, other, languages, heathen, comes, from, old, english, h, en, not, christian, or, jewish, cf, old, norse, hei, inn, this, meaning, for, the, term, originated, from, gothic, hai, no, gentile, woman, being, used, to, translate, hellene, in, wulfila, s, bible, the, first, translation, of, the, bible, into, a, germanic, language, this, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, greek, and, latin, terminology, of, the, time, used, for, pagans, if, so, it, may, be, derived, from, gothic, hai, i, dwelling, on, the, heath, however, this, is, not, attested, it, may, even, be, a, borrowing, of, greek, ethnos, via, armenian, hethanos, the, term, has, recently, been, revived, in, the, forms, heathenry, and, heathenism, often, but, not, always, capitalized, as, alternative, names, for, the, germanic, neopagan, movement, adherents, of, which, may, self, identify, as, heathens, it, is, perhaps, misleading, even, to, say, that, there, was, such, a, religion, as, paganism, at, the, beginning, of, it, might, be, less, confusing, to, say, that, the, pagans, before, their, competition, with, christianity, had, no, religion, at, all, in, the, sense, in, which, that, word, is, normally, used, today, they, had, no, tradition, of, discourse, about, ritual, or, religious, matters, apart, from, philosophical, debate, or, antiquarian, treatise, no, organized, system, of, beliefs, to, which, they, were, asked, to, commit, themselves, no, authority, structure, peculiar, to, the, religious, area, above, all, no, commitment, to, a, particular, group, of, people, or, set, of, ideas, other, than, their, family, and, political, context, if, this, is, the, right, view, of, pagan, life, it, follows, that, we, should, look, on, paganism, quite, simply, as, a, religion, invented, in, the, course, of, the, second, to, third, centuries, ad, in, competition, and, interaction, with, christians, jews, and, others, defining, paganism, is, complex, and, problematic, understanding, the, context, of, its, associated, terminology, is, important, early, christians, referred, to, the, diverse, array, of, cults, around, them, as, a, single, group, for, reasons, of, convenience, and, rhetoric, while, paganism, generally, implies, polytheism, the, primary, distinction, between, classical, pagans, and, christians, was, not, one, of, monotheism, versus, polytheism, as, not, all, pagans, were, strictly, polytheist, throughout, history, many, of, them, believed, in, a, supreme, deity, however, most, such, pagans, believed, in, a, class, of, subordinate, gods, daimons, see, henotheism, or, divine, emanations, to, christians, the, most, important, distinction, was, whether, or, not, someone, worshipped, the, one, true, god, those, who, did, not, polytheist, monotheist, or, atheist, were, outsiders, to, the, church, and, thus, considered, pagan, similarly, classical, pagans, would, have, found, it, peculiar, to, distinguish, groups, by, the, number, of, deities, followers, venerate, they, would, have, considered, the, priestly, colleges, such, as, the, college, of, pontiffs, or, epulones, and, cult, practices, more, meaningful, distinctions, referring, to, paganism, as, a, pre, christian, indigenous, religion, is, equally, untenable, not, all, historical, pagan, traditions, were, pre, christian, or, indigenous, to, their, places, of, worship, owing, to, the, history, of, its, nomenclature, paganism, traditionally, encompasses, the, collective, pre, and, non, christian, cultures, in, and, around, the, classical, world, including, those, of, the, greco, roman, celtic, germanic, and, slavic, tribes, however, modern, parlance, of, folklorists, and, contemporary, pagans, in, particular, has, extended, the, original, four, millennia, scope, used, by, early, christians, to, include, similar, religious, traditions, stretching, far, into, prehistory, paganism, came, to, be, equated, by, christians, with, a, sense, of, hedonism, representing, those, who, are, sensual, materialistic, self, indulgent, unconcerned, with, the, future, and, uninterested, in, more, mainstream, religions, pagans, were, usually, described, in, terms, of, this, worldly, stereotype, especially, among, those, drawing, attention, to, what, they, perceived, as, the, limitations, of, paganism, thus, g, k, chesterton, wrote, the, pagan, set, out, with, admirable, sense, to, enjoy, himself, by, the, end, of, his, civilization, he, had, discovered, that, a, man, cannot, enjoy, himself, and, continue, to, enjoy, anything, else, in, sharp, contrast, swinburne, the, poet, would, comment, on, this, same, theme, thou, hast, conquered, o, pale, galilean, the, world, has, grown, grey, from, thy, breath, we, have, drunken, of, things, lethean, and, fed, on, the, fullness, of, death, recently, the, ethnocentric, and, moral, absolutist, origins, of, the, common, usage, of, the, term, pagan, have, been, proposed, with, scholar, david, petts, noting, how, with, particular, reference, to, christianity, local, religions, are, defined, in, opposition, to, privileged, world, religions, they, become, everything, that, world, religions, are, not, rather, than, being, explored, as, a, subject, in, their, own, right, in, addition, petts, notes, how, various, spiritual, religious, and, metaphysical, ideas, branded, as, pagan, from, diverse, cultures, were, studied, in, opposition, to, abrahamism, in, early, anthropology, a, binary, he, links, to, ethnocentrism, and, colonialism, ludwig, feuerbach, defined, the, paganism, of, classical, antiquity, which, he, termed, heidentum, heathenry, as, the, unity, of, religion, and, politics, of, spirit, and, nature, of, god, and, man, qualified, by, the, observation, that, man, in, the, pagan, view, is, always, defined, by, ethnicity, i, e, as, a, result, every, pagan, tradition, is, also, a, national, tradition, modern, historians, define, paganism, instead, as, the, aggregate, of, cult, acts, set, within, a, civic, rather, than, a, national, context, without, a, written, creed, or, sense, of, orthodoxy, the, developments, in, the, religious, thought, of, the, far, flung, roman, empire, during, late, antiquity, need, to, be, addressed, separately, because, this, is, the, context, in, which, early, christianity, itself, developed, as, one, of, several, monotheistic, cults, and, it, was, in, this, period, that, the, concept, of, pagan, developed, in, the, first, place, as, christianity, emerged, from, second, temple, judaism, and, hellenistic, judaism, it, stood, in, competition, with, other, religions, advocating, pagan, monotheism, including, the, cults, of, dionysus, neoplatonism, mithraism, gnosticism, and, manichaeanism, dionysus, in, particular, exhibits, significant, parallels, with, christ, so, that, numerous, scholars, have, concluded, that, the, recasting, of, jesus, the, wandering, rabbi, into, the, image, of, christ, the, logos, the, divine, saviour, reflects, the, cult, of, dionysus, directly, they, point, to, the, symbolism, of, wine, and, the, importance, it, held, in, the, mythology, surrounding, both, dionysus, and, jesus, christ, wick, argues, that, the, use, of, wine, symbolism, in, the, gospel, of, john, including, the, story, of, the, marriage, at, cana, at, which, jesus, turns, water, into, wine, was, intended, to, show, jesus, as, superior, to, dionysus, the, scene, in, the, bacchae, wherein, dionysus, appears, before, king, pentheus, on, charges, of, claiming, divinity, is, compared, to, the, new, testament, scene, of, jesus, being, interrogated, by, pontius, pilate, the, medieval, church, accused, sects, deemed, heretical, such, as, the, waldensians, and, cathars, of, participating, in, pagan, fertility, rites, arab, paganism, gradually, disappeared, during, muhammad, s, era, through, islamization, the, sacred, months, of, the, arab, pagans, were, the, 1st, 7th, 11th, and, 12th, months, of, the, islamic, calendar, after, muhammad, had, conquered, mecca, he, set, out, to, convert, the, pagans, one, of, the, last, military, campaigns, that, muhammad, ordered, against, the, arab, pagans, was, the, demolition, of, dhul, khalasa, it, occurred, in, april, and, may, 632, ad, in, 10ah, of, the, islamic, calendar, dhul, khalasa, is, referred, to, as, both, an, idol, and, a, temple, and, it, was, known, by, some, as, the, ka, ba, of, yemen, built, and, worshipped, by, polytheist, tribes, interest, in, pagan, traditions, was, first, revived, during, the, renaissance, when, renaissance, magic, was, practiced, as, a, revival, of, greco, roman, magic, in, the, 17th, century, the, description, of, paganism, turned, from, a, theological, aspect, to, an, ethnological, one, and, religions, began, to, be, understood, as, part, of, the, ethnic, identities, of, peoples, and, the, study, of, the, religions, of, so, called, primitive, peoples, triggered, questions, as, to, the, ultimate, historical, origin, of, religion, jean, bodin, viewed, pagan, mythology, as, a, distorted, version, of, christian, truths, nicolas, fabri, de, peiresc, saw, the, pagan, religions, of, africa, of, his, day, as, relics, that, were, in, principle, capable, of, shedding, light, on, the, historical, paganism, of, classical, antiquity, great, god, i, d, rather, be, a, pagan, suckled, in, a, creed, outworn, so, might, i, standing, on, this, pleasant, lea, have, glimpses, that, would, make, me, less, forlorn, have, sight,

in, the, context, of, the, literary, celtic, slavic, and, viking, revivals, which, portrayed, historical, celtic, slavic, and, germanic, polytheists, as, noble, savages, the, 19th, century, also, saw, much, scholarly, interest, in, the, reconstruction, of, pagan, mythology, from, folklore, or, fairy, tales, this, was, notably, attempted, by, the, brothers, grimm, especially, jacob, grimm, in, his, teutonic, mythology, and, elias, l, nnrot, with, the, compilation, of, the, kalevala, the, work, of, the, brothers, grimm, influenced, other, collectors, both, inspiring, them, to, collect, tales, and, leading, them, to, similarly, believe, that, the, fairy, tales, of, a, country, were, particularly, representative, of, it, to, the, neglect, of, cross, cultural, influence, among, those, influenced, were, the, russian, alexander, afanasyev, the, norwegians, peter, christen, asbj, rnsen, and, j, rgen, moe, and, the, englishman, joseph, jacobs, romanticist, interest, in, non, classical, antiquity, coincided, with, the, rise, of, romantic, nationalism, and, the, rise, of, the, nation, state, in, the, context, of, the, 1848, revolutions, leading, to, the, creation, of, national, epics, and, national, myths, for, the, various, newly, formed, states, pagan, or, folkloric, topics, were, also, common, in, the, musical, nationalism, of, the, period, modern, paganism, or, neopaganism, includes, reconstructed, practice, such, as, roman, polytheistic, reconstructionism, hellenism, slavic, native, faith, celtic, reconstructionist, paganism, or, heathenry, as, well, as, modern, eclectic, traditions, such, as, wicca, and, its, many, offshoots, neo, druidism, and, discordianism, however, there, often, exists, a, distinction, or, separation, between, some, polytheistic, reconstructionists, such, as, hellenism, and, revivalist, neopagans, like, wiccans, the, divide, is, over, numerous, issues, such, as, the, importance, of, accurate, orthopraxy, according, to, ancient, sources, available, the, use, and, concept, of, magic, which, calendar, to, use, and, which, holidays, to, observe, as, well, as, the, use, of, the, term, pagan, itself, in, 1717, john, toland, became, the, first, chosen, chief, of, the, ancient, druid, order, which, became, known, as, the, british, circle, of, the, universal, bond, many, of, the, revivals, wicca, and, neo, druidism, in, particular, have, their, roots, in, 19th, century, romanticism, and, retain, noticeable, elements, of, occultism, or, theosophy, that, were, current, then, setting, them, apart, from, historical, rural, paganus, folk, religion, most, modern, pagans, however, believe, in, the, divine, character, of, the, natural, world, and, paganism, is, often, described, as, an, earth, religion, there, are, a, number, of, neopagan, authors, who, have, examined, the, relation, of, the, 20th, century, movements, of, polytheistic, revival, with, historical, polytheism, on, one, hand, and, contemporary,
