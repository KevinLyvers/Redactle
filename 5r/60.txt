in, philosophy, occam, s, razor, also, spelled, ockham, s, razor, or, ocham, s, razor, latin, novacula, occami, is, the, problem, solving, principle, that, recommends, searching, for, explanations, constructed, with, the, smallest, possible, set, of, elements, it, is, also, known, as, the, principle, of, parsimony, or, the, law, of, parsimony, latin, lex, parsimoniae, attributed, to, william, of, ockham, a, 14th, century, english, philosopher, and, theologian, it, is, frequently, cited, as, entia, non, sunt, multiplicanda, praeter, necessitatem, which, translates, as, entities, must, not, be, multiplied, beyond, necessity, although, occam, never, used, these, exact, words, popularly, the, principle, is, sometimes, paraphrased, as, the, simplest, explanation, is, usually, the, best, one, this, philosophical, razor, advocates, that, when, presented, with, competing, hypotheses, about, the, same, prediction, and, both, hypotheses, have, equal, explanatory, power, one, should, prefer, the, hypothesis, that, requires, the, fewest, assumptions, and, that, this, is, not, meant, to, be, a, way, of, choosing, between, hypotheses, that, make, different, predictions, similarly, in, science, occam, s, razor, is, used, as, an, abductive, heuristic, in, the, development, of, theoretical, models, rather, than, as, a, rigorous, arbiter, between, candidate, models, the, phrase, occam, s, razor, did, not, appear, until, a, few, centuries, after, william, of, ockham, s, death, in, 1347, libert, froidmont, in, his, on, christian, philosophy, of, the, soul, gives, him, credit, for, the, phrase, speaking, of, novacula, occami, ockham, did, not, invent, this, principle, but, its, fame, and, its, association, with, him, may, be, due, to, the, frequency, and, effectiveness, with, which, he, used, it, ockham, stated, the, principle, in, various, ways, but, the, most, popular, version, entities, are, not, to, be, multiplied, without, necessity, non, sunt, multiplicanda, entia, sine, necessitate, was, formulated, by, the, irish, franciscan, philosopher, john, punch, in, his, 1639, commentary, on, the, works, of, duns, scotus, the, origins, of, what, has, come, to, be, known, as, occam, s, razor, are, traceable, to, the, works, of, earlier, philosophers, such, as, john, duns, scotus, 1265, 1308, robert, grosseteste, 1175, 1253, maimonides, moses, ben, maimon, 1138, 1204, and, even, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, aristotle, writes, in, his, posterior, analytics, we, may, assume, the, superiority, ceteris, paribus, of, the, demonstration, which, derives, from, fewer, postulates, or, hypotheses, ptolemy, c, ad, 90, c, 168, stated, we, consider, it, a, good, principle, to, explain, the, phenomena, by, the, simplest, hypothesis, possible, phrases, such, as, it, is, vain, to, do, with, more, what, can, be, done, with, fewer, and, a, plurality, is, not, to, be, posited, without, necessity, were, commonplace, in, 13th, century, scholastic, writing, robert, grosseteste, in, commentary, on, the, posterior, analytics, books, commentarius, in, posteriorum, analyticorum, libros, c, 1217, 1220, declares, that, is, better, and, more, valuable, which, requires, fewer, other, circumstances, being, equal, for, if, one, thing, were, demonstrated, from, many, and, another, thing, from, fewer, equally, known, premises, clearly, that, is, better, which, is, from, fewer, because, it, makes, us, know, quickly, just, as, a, universal, demonstration, is, better, than, particular, because, it, produces, knowledge, from, fewer, premises, similarly, in, natural, science, in, moral, science, and, in, metaphysics, the, best, is, that, which, needs, no, premises, and, the, better, that, which, needs, the, fewer, other, circumstances, being, equal, the, summa, theologica, of, thomas, aquinas, 1225, 1274, states, that, it, is, superfluous, to, suppose, that, what, can, be, accounted, for, by, a, few, principles, has, been, produced, by, many, aquinas, uses, this, principle, to, construct, an, objection, to, god, s, existence, an, objection, that, he, in, turn, answers, and, refutes, generally, cf, quinque, viae, and, specifically, through, an, argument, based, on, causality, hence, aquinas, acknowledges, the, principle, that, today, is, known, as, occam, s, razor, but, prefers, causal, explanations, to, other, simple, explanations, cf, also, correlation, does, not, imply, causation, william, of, ockham, circa, 1287, 1347, was, an, english, franciscan, friar, and, theologian, an, influential, medieval, philosopher, and, a, nominalist, his, popular, fame, as, a, great, logician, rests, chiefly, on, the, maxim, attributed, to, him, and, known, as, occam, s, razor, the, term, razor, refers, to, distinguishing, between, two, hypotheses, either, by, shaving, away, unnecessary, assumptions, or, cutting, apart, two, similar, conclusions, while, it, has, been, claimed, that, occam, s, razor, is, not, found, in, any, of, william, s, writings, one, can, cite, statements, such, as, numquam, ponenda, est, pluralitas, sine, necessitate, plurality, must, never, be, posited, without, necessity, which, occurs, in, his, theological, work, on, the, sentences, of, peter, lombard, quaestiones, et, decisiones, in, quattuor, libros, sententiarum, petri, lombardi, ed, lugd, 1495, i, dist, 27, qu, 2, k, nevertheless, the, precise, words, sometimes, attributed, to, william, of, ockham, entia, non, sunt, multiplicanda, praeter, necessitatem, entities, must, not, be, multiplied, beyond, necessity, are, absent, in, his, extant, works, this, particular, phrasing, comes, from, john, punch, who, described, the, principle, as, a, common, axiom, axioma, vulgare, of, the, scholastics, william, of, ockham, himself, seems, to, restrict, the, operation, of, this, principle, in, matters, pertaining, to, miracles, and, god, s, power, considering, a, plurality, of, miracles, possible, in, the, eucharist, simply, because, it, pleases, god, this, principle, is, sometimes, phrased, as, pluralitas, non, est, ponenda, sine, necessitate, plurality, should, not, be, posited, without, necessity, in, his, summa, totius, logicae, i, 12, william, of, ockham, cites, the, principle, of, economy, frustra, fit, per, plura, quod, potest, fieri, per, pauciora, it, is, futile, to, do, with, more, things, that, which, can, be, done, with, fewer, thorburn, 1918, pp, 352, 53, kneale, and, kneale, 1962, p, 243, to, quote, isaac, newton, we, are, to, admit, no, more, causes, of, natural, things, than, such, as, are, both, true, and, sufficient, to, explain, their, appearances, therefore, to, the, same, natural, effects, we, must, as, far, as, possible, assign, the, same, causes, in, the, sentence, hypotheses, non, fingo, newton, affirms, the, success, of, this, approach, bertrand, russell, offers, a, particular, version, of, occam, s, razor, whenever, possible, substitute, constructions, out, of, known, entities, for, inferences, to, unknown, entities, around, 1960, ray, solomonoff, founded, the, theory, of, universal, inductive, inference, the, theory, of, prediction, based, on, observations, for, example, predicting, the, next, symbol, based, upon, a, given, series, of, symbols, the, only, assumption, is, that, the, environment, follows, some, unknown, but, computable, probability, distribution, this, theory, is, a, mathematical, formalization, of, occam, s, razor, another, technical, approach, to, occam, s, razor, is, ontological, parsimony, parsimony, means, spareness, and, is, also, referred, to, as, the, rule, of, simplicity, this, is, considered, a, strong, version, of, occam, s, razor, a, variation, used, in, medicine, is, called, the, zebra, a, physician, should, reject, an, exotic, medical, diagnosis, when, a, more, commonplace, explanation, is, more, likely, derived, from, theodore, woodward, s, dictum, when, you, hear, hoofbeats, think, of, horses, not, zebras, ernst, mach, formulated, the, stronger, version, of, occam, s, razor, into, physics, which, he, called, the, principle, of, economy, stating, scientists, must, use, the, simplest, means, of, arriving, at, their, results, and, exclude, everything, not, perceived, by, the, senses, this, principle, goes, back, at, least, as, far, as, aristotle, who, wrote, nature, operates, in, the, shortest, way, possible, the, idea, of, parsimony, or, simplicity, in, deciding, between, theories, though, not, the, intent, of, the, original, expression, of, occam, s, razor, has, been, assimilated, into, common, culture, as, the, widespread, layman, s, formulation, that, the, simplest, explanation, is, usually, the, correct, one, prior, to, the, 20th, century, it, was, a, commonly, held, belief, that, nature, itself, was, simple, and, that, simpler, hypotheses, about, nature, were, thus, more, likely, to, be, true, this, notion, was, deeply, rooted, in, the, aesthetic, value, that, simplicity, holds, for, human, thought, and, the, justifications, presented, for, it, often, drew, from, theology, thomas, aquinas, made, this, argument, in, the, 13th, century, writing, if, a, thing, can, be, done, adequately, by, means, of, one, it, is, superfluous, to, do, it, by, means, of, several, for, we, observe, that, nature, does, not, employ, two, instruments, one, suffices, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, epistemological, justifications, based, on, induction, logic, pragmatism, and, especially, probability, theory, have, become, more, popular, among, philosophers, occam, s, razor, has, gained, strong, empirical, support, in, helping, to, converge, on, better, theories, see, uses, section, below, for, some, examples, in, the, related, concept, of, overfitting, excessively, complex, models, are, affected, by, statistical, noise, a, problem, also, known, as, the, bias, variance, tradeoff, whereas, simpler, models, may, capture, the, underlying, structure, better, and, may, thus, have, better, predictive, performance, it, is, however, often, difficult, to, deduce, which, part, of, the, data, is, noise, cf, model, selection, test, set, minimum, description, length, bayesian, inference, etc, the, razor, s, statement, that, other, things, being, equal, simpler, explanations, are, generally, better, than, more, complex, ones, is, amenable, to, empirical, testing, another, interpretation, of, the, razor, s, statement, would, be, that, simpler, hypotheses, are, generally, better, than, the, complex, ones, the, procedure, to, test, the, former, interpretation, would, compare, the, track, records, of, simple, and, comparatively, complex, explanations, if, one, accepts, the, first, interpretation, the, validity, of, occam, s, razor, as, a, tool, would, then, have, to, be, rejected, if, the, more, complex, explanations, were, more, often, correct, than, the, less, complex, ones, while, the, converse, would, lend, support, to, its, use, if, the, latter, interpretation, is, accepted, the, validity, of, occam, s, razor, as, a, tool, could, possibly, be, accepted, if, the, simpler, hypotheses, led, to, correct, conclusions, more, often, than, not, even, if, some, increases, in, complexity, are, sometimes, necessary, there, still, remains, a, justified, general, bias, toward, the, simpler, of, two, competing, explanations, to, understand, why, consider, that, for, each, accepted, explanation, of, a, phenomenon, there, is, always, an, infinite, number, of, possible, more, complex, and, ultimately, incorrect, alternatives, this, is, so, because, one, can, always, burden, a, failing, explanation, with, an, ad, hoc, hypothesis, ad, hoc, hypotheses, are, justifications, that, prevent, theories, from, being, falsified, for, example, if, a, man, accused, of, breaking, a, vase, makes, supernatural, claims, that, leprechauns, were, responsible, for, the, breakage, a, simple, explanation, might, be, that, the, man, did, it, but, ongoing, ad, hoc, justifications, e, g, and, that, s, not, me, breaking, it, on, the, film, they, tampered, with, that, too, could, successfully, prevent, complete, disproof, this, endless, supply, of, elaborate, competing, explanations, called, saving, hypotheses, cannot, be, technically, ruled, out, except, by, using, occam, s, razor, any, more, complex, theory, might, still, possibly, be, true, a, study, of, the, predictive, validity, of, occam, s, razor, found, 32, published, papers, that, included, 97, comparisons, of, economic, forecasts, from, simple, and, complex, forecasting, methods, none, of, the, papers, provided, a, balance, of, evidence, that, complexity, of, method, improved, forecast, accuracy, in, the, 25, papers, with, quantitative, comparisons, complexity, increased, forecast, errors, by, an, average, of, 27, percent, one, justification, of, occam, s, razor, is, a, direct, result, of, basic, probability, theory, by, definition, all, assumptions, introduce, possibilities, for, error, if, an, assumption, does, not, improve, the, accuracy, of, a, theory, its, only, effect, is, to, increase, the, probability, that, the, overall, theory, is, wrong, there, have, also, been, other, attempts, to, derive, occam, s, razor, from, probability, theory, including, notable, attempts, made, by, harold, jeffreys, and, e, t, jaynes, the, probabilistic, bayesian, basis, for, occam, s, razor, is, elaborated, by, david, j, c, mackay, in, chapter, 28, of, his, book, information, theory, inference, and, learning, algorithms, where, he, emphasizes, that, a, prior, bias, in, favor, of, simpler, models, is, not, required, william, h, jefferys, and, james, o, berger, 1991, generalize, and, quantify, the, original, formulation, s, assumptions, concept, as, the, degree, to, which, a, proposition, is, unnecessarily, accommodating, to, possible, observable, data, they, state, a, hypothesis, with, fewer, adjustable, parameters, will, automatically, have, an, enhanced, posterior, probability, due, to, the, fact, that, the, predictions, it, makes, are, sharp, the, use, of, sharp, here, is, not, only, a, tongue, in, cheek, reference, to, the, idea, of, a, razor, but, also, indicates, that, such, predictions, are, more, accurate, than, competing, predictions, the, model, they, propose, balances, the, precision, of, a, theory, s, predictions, against, their, sharpness, preferring, theories, that, sharply, make, correct, predictions, over, theories, that, accommodate, a, wide, range, of, other, possible, results, this, again, reflects, the, mathematical, relationship, between, key, concepts, in, bayesian, inference, namely, marginal, probability, conditional, probability, and, posterior, probability, the, bias, variance, tradeoff, is, a, framework, that, incorporates, the, occam, s, razor, principle, in, its, balance, between, overfitting, associated, with, lower, bias, but, higher, variance, and, underfitting, associated, with, lower, variance, but, higher, bias, karl, popper, argues, that, a, preference, for, simple, theories, need, not, appeal, to, practical, or, aesthetic, considerations, our, preference, for, simplicity, may, be, justified, by, its, falsifiability, criterion, we, prefer, simpler, theories, to, more, complex, ones, because, their, empirical, content, is, greater, and, because, they, are, better, testable, the, idea, here, is, that, a, simple, theory, applies, to, more, cases, than, a, more, complex, one, and, is, thus, more, easily, falsifiable, this, is, again, comparing, a, simple, theory, to, a, more, complex, theory, where, both, explain, the, data, equally, well, the, philosopher, of, science, elliott, sober, once, argued, along, the, same, lines, as, popper, tying, simplicity, with, informativeness, the, simplest, theory, is, the, more, informative, in, the, sense, that, it, requires, less, information, to, a, question, he, has, since, rejected, this, account, of, simplicity, purportedly, because, it, fails, to, provide, an, epistemic, justification, for, simplicity, he, now, believes, that, simplicity, considerations, and, considerations, of, parsimony, in, particular, do, not, count, unless, they, reflect, something, more, fundamental, philosophers, he, suggests, may, have, made, the, error, of, hypostatizing, simplicity, i, e, endowed, it, with, a, sui, generis, existence, when, it, has, meaning, only, when, embedded, in, a, specific, context, sober, 1992, if, we, fail, to, justify, simplicity, considerations, on, the, basis, of, the, context, in, which, we, use, them, we, may, have, no, non, circular, justification, just, as, the, question, why, be, rational, may, have, no, non, circular, answer, the, same, may, be, true, of, the, question, why, should, simplicity, be, considered, in, evaluating, the, plausibility, of, hypotheses, richard, swinburne, argues, for, simplicity, on, logical, grounds, the, simplest, hypothesis, proposed, as, an, explanation, of, phenomena, is, more, likely, to, be, the, true, one, than, is, any, other, available, hypothesis, that, its, predictions, are, more, likely, to, be, true, than, those, of, any, other, available, hypothesis, and, that, it, is, an, ultimate, a, priori, epistemic, principle, that, simplicity, is, evidence, for, truth, according, to, swinburne, since, our, choice, of, theory, cannot, be, determined, by, data, see, underdetermination, and, duhem, quine, thesis, we, must, rely, on, some, criterion, to, determine, which, theory, to, use, since, it, is, absurd, to, have, no, logical, method, for, settling, on, one, hypothesis, amongst, an, infinite, number, of, equally, data, compliant, hypotheses, we, should, choose, the, simplest, theory, either, science, is, irrational, or, the, principle, of, simplicity, is, a, fundamental, synthetic, a, priori, truth, from, the, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, and, on, the, related, concept, of, simplicity, in, science, occam, s, razor, is, used, as, a, heuristic, to, guide, scientists, in, developing, theoretical, models, rather, than, as, an, arbiter, between, published, models, in, physics, parsimony, was, an, important, heuristic, in, albert, einstein, s, formulation, of, special, relativity, in, the, development, and, application, of, the, principle, of, least, action, by, pierre, louis, maupertuis, and, leonhard, euler, and, in, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, by, max, planck, werner, heisenberg, and, louis, de, broglie, in, chemistry, occam, s, razor, is, often, an, important, heuristic, when, developing, a, model, of, a, reaction, mechanism, although, it, is, useful, as, a, heuristic, in, developing, models, of, reaction, mechanisms, it, has, been, shown, to, fail, as, a, criterion, for, selecting, among, some, selected, published, models, in, this, context, einstein, himself, expressed, caution, when, he, formulated, einstein, s, constraint, it, can, scarcely, be, denied, that, the, supreme, goal, of, all, theory, is, to, make, the, irreducible, basic, elements, as, simple, and, as, few, as, possible, without, having, to, surrender, the, adequate, representation, of, a, single, datum, of, experience, an, often, quoted, version, of, this, constraint, which, cannot, be, verified, as, posited, by, einstein, himself, reduces, this, to, everything, should, be, kept, as, simple, as, possible, but, not, simpler, in, the, scientific, method, occam, s, razor, is, not, considered, an, irrefutable, principle, of, logic, or, a, scientific, result, the, preference, for, simplicity, in, the, scientific, method, is, based, on, the, falsifiability, criterion, for, each, accepted, explanation, of, a, phenomenon, there, may, be, an, extremely, large, perhaps, even, incomprehensible, number, of, possible, and, more, complex, alternatives, since, failing, explanations, can, always, be, burdened, with, ad, hoc, hypotheses, to, prevent, them, from, being, falsified, simpler, theories, are, preferable, to, more, complex, ones, because, they, tend, to, be, more, testable, as, a, logical, principle, occam, s, razor, would, demand, that, scientists, accept, the, simplest, possible, theoretical, explanation, for, existing, data, however, science, has, shown, repeatedly, that, future, data, often, support, more, complex, theories, than, do, existing, data, science, prefers, the, simplest, explanation, that, is, consistent, with, the, data, available, at, a, given, time, but, the, simplest, explanation, may, be, ruled, out, as, new, data, become, available, that, is, science, is, open, to, the, possibility, that, future, experiments, might, support, more, complex, theories, than, demanded, by, current, data, and, is, more, interested, in, designing, experiments, to, discriminate, between, competing, theories, than, favoring, one, theory, over, another, based, merely, on, philosophical, principles, when, scientists, use, the, idea, of, parsimony, it, has, meaning, only, in, a, very, specific, context, of, inquiry, several, background, assumptions, are, required, for, parsimony, to, connect, with, plausibility, in, a, particular, research, problem, the, reasonableness, of, parsimony, in, one, research, context, may, have, nothing, to, do, with, its, reasonableness, in, another, it, is, a, mistake, to, think, that, there, is, a, single, global, principle, that, spans, diverse, subject, matter, it, has, been, suggested, that, occam, s, razor, is, a, widely, accepted, example, of, extraevidential, consideration, even, though, it, is, entirely, a, metaphysical, assumption, most, of, the, time, however, occam, s, razor, is, a, conservative, tool, cutting, out, crazy, complicated, constructions, and, assuring, that, hypotheses, are, grounded, in, the, science, of, the, day, thus, yielding, normal, science, models, of, explanation, and, prediction, there, are, however, notable, exceptions, where, occam, s, razor, turns, a, conservative, scientist, into, a, reluctant, revolutionary, for, example, max, planck, interpolated, between, the, wien, and, jeans, radiation, laws, and, used, occam, s, razor, logic, to, formulate, the, quantum, hypothesis, even, resisting, that, hypothesis, as, it, became, more, obvious, that, it, was, correct, appeals, to, simplicity, were, used, to, argue, against, the, phenomena, of, meteorites, ball, lightning, continental, drift, and, reverse, transcriptase, one, can, argue, for, atomic, building, blocks, for, matter, because, it, provides, a, simpler, explanation, for, the, observed, reversibility, of, both, mixing, and, chemical, reactions, as, simple, separation, and, rearrangements, of, atomic, building, blocks, at, the, time, however, the, atomic, theory, was, considered, more, complex, because, it, implied, the, existence, of, invisible, particles, that, had, not, been, directly, detected, ernst, mach, and, the, logical, positivists, rejected, john, dalton, s, atomic, theory, until, the, reality, of, atoms, was, more, evident, in, brownian, motion, as, shown, by, albert, einstein, in, the, same, way, postulating, the, aether, is, more, complex, than, transmission, of, light, through, a, vacuum, at, the, time, however, all, known, waves, propagated, through, a, physical, medium, and, it, seemed, simpler, to, postulate, the, existence, of, a, medium, than, to, theorize, about, wave, propagation, without, a, medium, likewise, isaac, newton, s, idea, of, light, particles, seemed, simpler, than, christiaan, huygens, s, idea, of, waves, so, many, favored, it, in, this, case, as, it, turned, out, neither, the, wave, nor, the, particle, explanation, alone, suffices, as, light, behaves, like, waves, and, like, particles, three, axioms, presupposed, by, the, scientific, method, are, realism, the, existence, of, objective, reality, the, existence, of, natural, laws, and, the, constancy, of, natural, law, rather, than, depend, on, provability, of, these, axioms, science, depends, on, the, fact, that, they, have, not, been, objectively, falsified, occam, s, razor, and, parsimony, support, but, do, not, prove, these, axioms, of, science, the, general, principle, of, science, is, that, theories, or, models, of, natural, law, must, be, consistent, with, repeatable, experimental, observations, this, ultimate, arbiter, selection, criterion, rests, upon, the, axioms, mentioned, above, if, multiple, models, of, natural, law, make, exactly, the, same, testable, predictions, they, are, equivalent, and, there, is, no, need, for, parsimony, to, choose, a, preferred, one, for, example, newtonian, hamiltonian, and, lagrangian, classical, mechanics, are, equivalent, physicists, have, no, interest, in, using, occam, s, razor, to, say, the, other, two, are, wrong, likewise, there, is, no, demand, for, simplicity, principles, to, arbitrate, between, wave, and, matrix, formulations, of, quantum, mechanics, science, often, does, not, demand, arbitration, or, selection, criteria, between, models, that, make, the, same, testable, predictions, biologists, or, philosophers, of, biology, use, occam, s, razor, in, either, of, two, contexts, both, in, evolutionary, biology, the, units, of, selection, controversy, and, systematics, george, c, williams, in, his, book, adaptation, and, natural, selection, 1966, argues, that, the, best, way, to, explain, altruism, among, animals, is, based, on, low, level, i, e, individual, selection, as, opposed, to, high, level, group, selection, altruism, is, defined, by, some, evolutionary, biologists, e, g, r, alexander, 1987, w, d, hamilton, 1964, as, behavior, that, is, beneficial, to, others, or, to, the, group, at, a, cost, to, the, individual, and, many, posit, individual, selection, as, the, mechanism, that, explains, altruism, solely, in, terms, of, the, behaviors, of, individual, organisms, acting, in, their, own, self, interest, or, in, the, interest, of, their, genes, via, kin, selection, williams, was, arguing, against, the, perspective, of, others, who, propose, selection, at, the, level, of, the, group, as, an, evolutionary, mechanism, that, selects, for, altruistic, traits, e, g, d, s, wilson, e, o, wilson, 2007, the, basis, for, williams, contention, is, that, of, the, two, individual, selection, is, the, more, parsimonious, theory, in, doing, so, he, is, invoking, a, variant, of, occam, s, razor, known, as, morgan, s, canon, in, no, case, is, an, animal, activity, to, be, interpreted, in, terms, of, higher, psychological, processes, if, it, can, be, fairly, interpreted, in, terms, of, processes, which, stand, lower, in, the, scale, of, psychological, evolution, and, development, morgan, 1903, however, more, recent, biological, analyses, such, as, richard, dawkins, the, selfish, gene, have, contended, that, morgan, s, canon, is, not, the, simplest, and, most, basic, explanation, dawkins, argues, the, way, evolution, works, is, that, the, genes, propagated, in, most, copies, end, up, determining, the, development, of, that, particular, species, i, e, natural, selection, turns, out, to, select, specific, genes, and, this, is, really, the, fundamental, underlying, principle, that, automatically, gives, individual, and, group, selection, as, emergent, features, of, evolution, zoology, provides, an, example, muskoxen, when, threatened, by, wolves, form, a, circle, with, the, males, on, the, outside, and, the, females, and, young, on, the, inside, this, is, an, example, of, a, behavior, by, the, males, that, seems, to, be, altruistic, the, behavior, is, disadvantageous, to, them, individually, but, beneficial, to, the, group, as, a, whole, and, was, thus, seen, by, some, to, support, the, group, selection, theory, another, interpretation, is, kin, selection, if, the, males, are, protecting, their, offspring, they, are, protecting, copies, of, their, own, alleles, engaging, in, this, behavior, would, be, favored, by, individual, selection, if, the, cost, to, the, male, musk, ox, is, less, than, half, of, the, benefit, received, by, his, calf, which, could, easily, be, the, case, if, wolves, have, an, easier, time, killing, calves, than, adult, males, it, could, also, be, the, case, that, male, musk, oxen, would, be, individually, less, likely, to, be, killed, by, wolves, if, they, stood, in, a, circle, with, their, horns, pointing, out, regardless, of, whether, they, were, protecting, the, females, and, offspring, that, would, be, an, example, of, regular, natural, selection, a, phenomenon, called, the, selfish, herd, systematics, is, the, branch, of, biology, that, attempts, to, establish, patterns, of, relationship, among, biological, taxa, today, generally, thought, to, reflect, evolutionary, history, it, is, also, concerned, with, their, classification, there, are, three, primary, camps, in, systematics, cladists, pheneticists, and, evolutionary, taxonomists, cladists, hold, that, classification, should, be, based, on, synapomorphies, shared, derived, character, states, pheneticists, contend, that, overall, similarity, synapomorphies, and, complementary, symplesiomorphies, is, the, determining, criterion, while, evolutionary, taxonomists, say, that, both, genealogy, and, similarity, count, in, classification, in, a, manner, determined, by, the, evolutionary, taxonomist, it, is, among, the, cladists, that, occam, s, razor, is, applied, through, the, method, of, cladistic, parsimony, cladistic, parsimony, or, maximum, parsimony, is, a, method, of, phylogenetic, inference, that, yields, phylogenetic, trees, more, specifically, cladograms, cladograms, are, branching, diagrams, used, to, represent, hypotheses, of, relative, degree, of, relationship, based, on, synapomorphies, cladistic, parsimony, is, used, to, select, as, the, preferred, hypothesis, of, relationships, the, cladogram, that, requires, the, fewest, implied, character, state, transformations, or, smallest, weight, if, characters, are, differentially, weighted, critics, of, the, cladistic, approach, often, observe, that, for, some, types, of, data, parsimony, could, produce, the, wrong, results, regardless, of, how, much, data, is, collected, this, is, called, statistical, inconsistency, or, long, branch, attraction, however, this, criticism, is, also, potentially, true, for, any, type, of, phylogenetic, inference, unless, the, model, used, to, estimate, the, tree, reflects, the, way, that, evolution, actually, happened, because, this, information, is, not, empirically, accessible, the, criticism, of, statistical, inconsistency, against, parsimony, holds, no, force, for, a, book, length, treatment, of, cladistic, parsimony, see, elliott, sober, s, reconstructing, the, past, parsimony, evolution, and, inference, 1988, for, a, discussion, of, both, uses, of, occam, s, razor, in, biology, see, sober, s, article, let, s, razor, ockham, s, razor, 1990, other, methods, for, inferring, evolutionary, relationships, use, parsimony, in, a, more, general, way, likelihood, methods, for, phylogeny, use, parsimony, as, they, do, for, all, likelihood, tests, with, hypotheses, requiring, fewer, differing, parameters, i, e, numbers, or, different, rates, of, character, change, or, different, frequencies, of, character, state, transitions, being, treated, as, null, hypotheses, relative, to, hypotheses, requiring, more, differing, parameters, thus, complex, hypotheses, must, predict, data, much, better, than, do, simple, hypotheses, before, researchers, reject, the, simple, hypotheses, recent, advances, employ, information, theory, a, close, cousin, of, likelihood, which, uses, occam, s, razor, in, the, same, way, the, choice, of, the, shortest, tree, relative, to, a, not, so, short, tree, under, any, optimality, criterion, smallest, distance, fewest, steps, or, maximum, likelihood, is, always, based, on, parsimony, francis, crick, has, commented, on, potential, limitations, of, occam, s, razor, in, biology, he, advances, the, argument, that, because, biological, systems, are, the, products, of, an, ongoing, natural, selection, the, mechanisms, are, not, necessarily, optimal, in, an, obvious, sense, he, cautions, while, ockham, s, razor, is, a, useful, tool, in, the, physical, sciences, it, can, be, a, very, dangerous, implement, in, biology, it, is, thus, very, rash, to, use, simplicity, and, elegance, as, a, guide, in, biological, research, this, is, an, ontological, critique, of, parsimony, in, biogeography, parsimony, is, used, to, infer, ancient, vicariant, events, or, migrations, of, species, or, populations, by, observing, the, geographic, distribution, and, relationships, of, existing, organisms, given, the, phylogenetic, tree, ancestral, population, subdivisions, are, inferred, to, be, those, that, require, the, minimum, amount, of, change, in, the, philosophy, of, religion, occam, s, razor, is, sometimes, applied, to, the, existence, of, god, william, of, ockham, himself, was, a, christian, he, believed, in, god, and, in, the, authority, of, christian, scripture, he, writes, that, nothing, ought, to, be, posited, without, a, reason, given, unless, it, is, self, evident, literally, known, through, itself, or, known, by, experience, or, proved, by, the, authority, of, sacred, scripture, ockham, believed, that, an, explanation, has, no, sufficient, basis, in, reality, when, it, does, not, harmonize, with, reason, experience, or, the, bible, unlike, many, theologians, of, his, time, though, ockham, did, not, believe, god, could, be, logically, proven, with, arguments, to, ockham, science, was, a, matter, of, discovery, theology, was, a, matter, of, revelation, and, faith, he, states, only, faith, gives, us, access, to, theological, truths, the, ways, of, god, are, not, open, to, reason, for, god, has, freely, chosen, to, create, a, world, and, establish, a, way, of, salvation, within, it, apart, from, any, necessary, laws, that, human, logic, or, rationality, can, uncover, thomas, aquinas, in, the, summa, theologica, uses, a, formulation, of, occam, s, razor, to, construct, an, objection, to, the, idea, that, god, exists, which, he, refutes, directly, with, a, counterargument, further, it, is, superfluous, to, suppose, that, what, can, be, accounted, for, by, a, few, principles, has, been, produced, by, many, but, it, seems, that, everything, we, see, in, the, world, can, be, accounted, for, by, other, principles, supposing, god, did, not, exist, for, all, natural, things, can, be, reduced, to, one, principle, which, is, nature, and, all, voluntary, things, can, be, reduced, to, one, principle, which, is, human, reason, or, will, therefore, there, is, no, need, to, suppose, god, s, existence, in, turn, aquinas, answers, this, with, the, quinque, viae, and, addresses, the, particular, objection, above, with, the, following, answer, since, nature, works, for, a, determinate, end, under, the, direction, of, a, higher, agent, whatever, is, done, by, nature, must, needs, be, traced, back, to, god, as, to, its, first, cause, so, also, whatever, is, done, voluntarily, must, also, be, traced, back, to, some, higher, cause, other, than, human, reason, or, will, since, these, can, change, or, fail, for, all, things, that, are, changeable, and, capable, of, defect, must, be, traced, back, to, an, immovable, and, self, necessary, first, principle, as, was, shown, in, the, body, of, the, article, rather, than, argue, for, the, necessity, of, a, god, some, theists, base, their, belief, upon, grounds, independent, of, or, prior, to, reason, making, occam, s, razor, irrelevant, this, was, the, stance, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, who, viewed, belief, in, god, as, a, leap, of, faith, that, sometimes, directly, opposed, reason, this, is, also, the, doctrine, of, gordon, clark, s, presuppositional, apologetics, with, the, exception, that, clark, never, thought, the, leap, of, faith, was, contrary, to, reason, see, also, fideism, various, arguments, in, favor, of, god, establish, god, as, a, useful, or, even, necessary, assumption, contrastingly, some, anti, theists, hold, firmly, to, the, belief, that, assuming, the, existence, of, god, introduces, unnecessary, complexity, e, g, the, ultimate, boeing, 747, gambit, from, dawkins, s, the, god, delusion, another, application, of, the, principle, is, to, be, found, in, the, work, of, george, berkeley, 1685, 1753, berkeley, was, an, idealist, who, believed, that, all, of, reality, could, be, explained, in, terms, of, the, mind, alone, he, invoked, occam, s, razor, against, materialism, stating, that, matter, was, not, required, by, his, metaphysics, and, was, thus, eliminable, one, potential, problem, with, this, belief, is, that, it, s, possible, given, berkeley, s, position, to, find, solipsism, itself, more, in, line, with, the, razor, than, a, god, mediated, world, beyond, a, single, thinker, occam, s, razor, may, also, be, recognized, in, the, apocryphal, story, about, an, exchange, between, pierre, simon, laplace, and, napoleon, it, is, said, that, in, praising, laplace, for, one, of, his, recent, publications, the, emperor, asked, how, it, was, that, the, name, of, god, which, featured, so, frequently, in, the, writings, of, lagrange, appeared, nowhere, in, laplace, s, at, that, he, is, said, to, have, replied, it, s, because, i, had, no, need, of, that, hypothesis, though, some, points, of, this, story, illustrate, laplace, s, atheism, more, careful, consideration, suggests, that, he, may, instead, have, intended, merely, to, illustrate, the, power, of, methodological, naturalism, or, even, simply, that, the, fewer, logical, premises, one, assumes, the, stronger, is, one, s, conclusion, in, his, article, sensations, and, brain, processes, 1959, j, j, c, smart, invoked, occam, s, razor, with, the, aim, to, justify, his, preference, of, the, mind, brain, identity, theory, over, spirit, body, dualism, dualists, state, that, there, are, two, kinds, of, substances, in, the, universe, physical, including, the, body, and, spiritual, which, is, non, physical, in, contrast, identity, theorists, state, that, everything, is, physical, including, consciousness, and, that, there, is, nothing, nonphysical, though, it, is, impossible, to, appreciate, the, spiritual, when, limiting, oneself, to, the, physical, smart, maintained, that, identity, theory, explains, all, phenomena, by, assuming, only, a, physical, reality, subsequently, smart, has, been, severely, criticized, for, his, use, or, misuse, of, occam, s, razor, and, ultimately, retracted, his, advocacy, of, it, in, this, context, paul, churchland, 1984, states, that, by, itself, occam, s, razor, is, inconclusive, regarding, duality, in, a, similar, way, dale, jacquette, 1994, stated, that, occam, s, razor, has, been, used, in, attempts, to, justify, eliminativism, and, reductionism, in, the, philosophy, of, mind, eliminativism, is, the, thesis, that, the, ontology, of, folk, psychology, including, such, entities, as, pain, joy, desire, fear, etc, are, eliminable, in, favor, of, an, ontology, of, a, completed, neuroscience, in, penal, theory, and, the, philosophy, of, punishment, parsimony, refers, specifically, to, taking, care, in, the, distribution, of, punishment, in, order, to, avoid, excessive, punishment, in, the, utilitarian, approach, to, the, philosophy, of, punishment, jeremy, bentham, s, parsimony, principle, states, that, any, punishment, greater, than, is, required, to, achieve, its, end, is, unjust, the, concept, is, related, but, not, identical, to, the, legal, concept, of, proportionality, parsimony, is, a, key, consideration, of, the, modern, restorative, justice, and, is, a, component, of, utilitarian, approaches, to, punishment, as, well, as, the, prison, abolition, movement, bentham, believed, that, true, parsimony, would, require, punishment, to, be, individualised, to, take, account, of, the, sensibility, of, the, individual, an, individual, more, sensitive, to, punishment, should, be, given, a, proportionately, lesser, one, since, otherwise, needless, pain, would, be, inflicted, later, utilitarian, writers, have, tended, to, abandon, this, idea, in, large, part, due, to, the, impracticality, of, determining, each, alleged, criminal, s, relative, sensitivity, to, specific, punishments, marcus, hutter, s, universal, artificial, intelligence, builds, upon, solomonoff, s, mathematical, formalization, of, the, razor, to, calculate, the, expected, value, of, an, action, there, are, various, papers, in, scholarly, journals, deriving, formal, versions, of, occam, s, razor, from, probability, theory, applying, it, in, statistical, inference, and, using, it, to, come, up, with, criteria, for, penalizing, complexity, in, statistical, inference, papers, have, suggested, a, connection, between, occam, s, razor, and, kolmogorov, complexity, one, of, the, problems, with, the, original, formulation, of, the, razor, is, that, it, only, applies, to, models, with, the, same, explanatory, power, i, e, it, only, tells, us, to, prefer, the, simplest, of, equally, good, models, a, more, general, form, of, the, razor, can, be, derived, from, bayesian, model, comparison, which, is, based, on, bayes, factors, and, can, be, used, to, compare, models, that, do, not, fit, the, observations, equally, well, these, methods, can, sometimes, optimally, balance, the, complexity, and, power, of, a, model, generally, the, exact, occam, factor, is, intractable, but, approximations, such, as, akaike, information, criterion, bayesian, information, criterion, variational, bayesian, methods, false, discovery, rate, and, laplace, s, method, are, used, many, artificial, intelligence, researchers, are, now, employing, such, techniques, for, instance, through, work, on, occam, learning, or, more, generally, on, the, free, energy, principle, statistical, versions, of, occam, s, razor, have, a, more, rigorous, formulation, than, what, philosophical, discussions, produce, in, particular, they, must, have, a, specific, definition, of, the, term, simplicity, and, that, definition, can, vary, for, example, in, the, kolmogorov, chaitin, minimum, description, length, approach, the, subject, must, pick, a, turing, machine, whose, operations, describe, the, basic, operations, believed, to, represent, simplicity, by, the, subject, however, one, could, always, choose, a, turing, machine, with, a, simple, operation, that, happened, to, construct, one, s, entire, theory, and, would, hence, score, highly, under, the, razor, this, has, led, to, two, opposing, camps, one, that, believes, occam, s, razor, is, objective, and, one, that, believes, it, is, subjective, the, minimum, instruction, set, of, a, universal, turing, machine, requires, approximately, the, same, length, description, across, different, formulations, and, is, small, compared, to, the, kolmogorov, complexity, of, most, practical, theories, marcus, hutter, has, used, this, consistency, to, define, a, natural, turing, machine, of, small, size, as, the, proper, basis, for, excluding, arbitrarily, complex, instruction, sets, in, the, formulation, of, razors, describing, the, program, for, the, universal, program, as, the, hypothesis, and, the, representation, of, the, evidence, as, program, data, it, has, been, formally, proven, under, zermelo, fraenkel, set, theory, that, the, sum, of, the, log, universal, probability, of, the, model, plus, the, log, of, the, probability, of, the, data, given, the, model, should, be, minimized, interpreting, this, as, minimising, the, total, length, of, a, two, part, message, encoding, model, followed, by, data, given, model, gives, us, the, minimum, message, length, mml, principle, one, possible, conclusion, from, mixing, the, concepts, of, kolmogorov, complexity, and, occam, s, razor, is, that, an, ideal, data, compressor, would, also, be, a, scientific, explanation, formulation, generator, some, attempts, have, been, made, to, re, derive, known, laws, from, considerations, of, simplicity, or, compressibility, according, to, j, rgen, schmidhuber, the, appropriate, mathematical, theory, of, occam, s, razor, already, exists, namely, solomonoff, s, theory, of, optimal, inductive, inference, and, its, extensions, see, discussions, in, david, l, dowe, s, foreword, re, c, s, wallace, for, the, subtle, distinctions, between, the, algorithmic, probability, work, of, solomonoff, and, the, mml, work, of, chris, wallace, and, see, dowe, s, mml, hybrid, bayesian, network, graphical, models, statistical, consistency, invariance, and, uniqueness, both, for, such, discussions, and, for, in, section, 4, discussions, of, mml, and, occam, s, razor, for, a, specific, example, of, mml, as, occam, s, razor, in, the, problem, of, decision, tree, induction, see, dowe, and, needham, s, message, length, as, an, effective, ockham, s, razor, in, decision, tree, induction, the, no, free, lunch, nfl, theorems, for, inductive, inference, prove, that, occam, s, razor, must, rely, on, ultimately, arbitrary, assumptions, concerning, the, prior, probability, distribution, found, in, our, world, specifically, suppose, one, is, given, two, inductive, inference, algorithms, a, and, b, where, a, is, a, bayesian, procedure, based, on, the, choice, of, some, prior, distribution, motivated, by, occam, s, razor, e, g, the, prior, might, favor, hypotheses, with, smaller, kolmogorov, complexity, suppose, that, b, is, the, anti, bayes, procedure, which, calculates, what, the, bayesian, algorithm, a, based, on, occam, s, razor, will, predict, and, then, predicts, the, exact, opposite, then, there, are, just, as, many, actual, priors, including, those, different, from, the, occam, s, razor, prior, assumed, by, a, in, which, algorithm, b, outperforms, a, as, priors, in, which, the, procedure, a, based, on, occam, s, razor, comes, out, on, top, in, particular, the, nfl, theorems, show, that, the, occam, factors, bayesian, argument, for, occam, s, razor, must, make, ultimately, arbitrary, modeling, assumptions, in, software, development, the, rule, of, least, power, argues, the, correct, programming, language, to, use, is, the, one, that, is, simplest, while, also, solving, the, targeted, software, problem, in, that, form, the, rule, is, often, credited, to, tim, berners, lee, since, it, appeared, in, his, design, guidelines, for, the, original, hypertext, transfer, protocol, complexity, in, this, context, is, measured, either, by, placing, a, language, into, the, chomsky, hierarchy, or, by, listing, idiomatic, features, of, the, language, and, comparing, according, to, some, agreed, to, scale, of, difficulties, between, idioms, many, languages, once, thought, to, be, of, lower, complexity, have, evolved, or, later, been, discovered, to, be, more, complex, than, originally, intended, so, in, practice, this, rule, is, applied, to, the, relative, ease, of, a, programmer, to, obtain, the, power, of, the, language, rather, than, the, precise, theoretical, limits, of, the, language, occam, s, razor, is, not, an, embargo, against, the, positing, of, any, kind, of, entity, or, a, recommendation, of, the, simplest, theory, come, what, may, occam, s, razor, is, used, to, adjudicate, between, theories, that, have, already, passed, theoretical, scrutiny, tests, and, are, equally, well, supported, by, evidence, furthermore, it, may, be, used, to, prioritize, empirical, testing, between, two, equally, plausible, but, unequally, testable, hypotheses, thereby, minimizing, costs, and, wastes, while, increasing, chances, of, falsification, of, the, simpler, to, test, hypothesis, another, contentious, aspect, of, the, razor, is, that, a, theory, can, become, more, complex, in, terms, of, its, structure, or, syntax, while, its, ontology, or, semantics, becomes, simpler, or, vice, versa, quine, in, a, discussion, on, definition, referred, to, these, two, perspectives, as, economy, of, practical, expression, and, economy, in, grammar, and, vocabulary, respectively, galileo, galilei, lampooned, the, misuse, of, occam, s, razor, in, his, dialogue, the, principle, is, represented, in, the, dialogue, by, simplicio, the, telling, point, that, galileo, presented, ironically, was, that, if, one, really, wanted, to, start, from, a, small, number, of, entities, one, could, always, consider, the, letters, of, the, alphabet, as, the, fundamental, entities, since, one, could, construct, the, whole, of, human, knowledge, out, of, them, instances, of, using, occam, s, razor, to, justify, belief, in, less, complex, and, more, simple, theories, have, been, criticized, as, using, the, razor, inappropriately, for, instance, francis, crick, stated, that, while, occam, s, razor, is, a, useful, tool, in, the, physical, sciences, it, can, be, a, very, dangerous, implement, in, biology, it, is, thus, very, rash, to, use, simplicity, and, elegance, as, a, guide, in, biological, research, occam, s, razor, has, met, some, opposition, from, people, who, consider, it, too, extreme, or, rash, walter, chatton, c, 1290, 1343, was, a, contemporary, of, william, of, ockham, who, took, exception, to, occam, s, razor, and, ockham, s, use, of, it, in, response, he, devised, his, own, anti, razor, if, three, things, are, not, enough, to, verify, an, affirmative, proposition, about, things, a, fourth, must, be, added, and, so, on, although, there, have, been, several, philosophers, who, have, formulated, similar, anti, razors, since, chatton, s, time, no, one, anti, razor, has, perpetuated, as, notably, as, chatton, s, anti, razor, although, this, could, be, the, case, of, the, late, renaissance, italian, motto, of, unknown, attribution, se, non, vero, ben, trovato, even, if, it, is, not, true, it, is, well, conceived, when, referred, to, a, particularly, artful, explanation, anti, razors, have, also, been, created, by, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, 1646, 1716, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, and, karl, menger, 1902, 1985, leibniz, s, version, took, the, form, of, a, principle, of, plenitude, as, arthur, lovejoy, has, called, it, the, idea, being, that, god, created, the, most, varied, and, populous, of, possible, worlds, kant, felt, a, need, to, moderate, the, effects, of, occam, s, razor, and, thus, created, his, own, counter, razor, the, variety, of, beings, should, not, rashly, be, diminished, karl, menger, found, mathematicians, to, be, too, parsimonious, with, regard, to, variables, so, he, formulated, his, law, against, miserliness, which, took, one, of, two, forms, entities, must, not, be, reduced, to, the, point, of, inadequacy, and, it, is, vain, to, do, with, fewer, what, requires, more, a, less, serious, but, even, more, extremist, anti, razor, is, pataphysics, the, science, of, imaginary, solutions, developed, by, alfred, jarry, 1873, 1907, perhaps, the, ultimate, in, anti, reductionism, pataphysics, seeks, no, less, than, to, view, each, event, in, the, universe, as, completely, unique, subject, to, no, laws, but, its, own, variations, on, this, theme, were, subsequently, explored, by, the, argentine, writer, jorge, luis, borges, in, his, story, mock, essay, tl, n, uqbar, orbis, tertius, physicist, r, v, jones, contrived, crabtree, s, bludgeon, which, states, that, o, set, of, mutually, inconsistent, observations, can, exist, for, which, some, human, intellect, cannot, conceive, a, coherent, explanation, however, complicated, recently, american, physicist, igor, mazin, argued, that, because, high, profile, physics, journals, prefer, publications, offering, exotic, and, unusual, interpretations, the, occam, s, razor, principle, is, being, replaced, by, an, inverse, occam, s, razor, implying, that, the, simplest, possible, explanation, is, usually, rejected, since, 2012, the, skeptic, magazine, annually, awards, the, ockham, awards, or, simply, the, ockhams, named, after, occam, s, razor, at, qed, the, ockhams, were, introduced, by, editor, in, chief, deborah, hyde, to, recognise, the, effort, and, time, that, have, gone, into, the, community, s, favourite, skeptical, blogs, skeptical, podcasts, skeptical, campaigns, and, outstanding, contributors, to, the, skeptical, cause, the, trophies, designed, by, neil, davies, and, karl, derrick, carry, the, upper, text, ockham, s, and, the, lower, text, the, skeptic, shaving, away, unnecessary, assumptions, since, 1285, between, the, texts, there, is, an, image, of, a, double, edged, safety, razorblade, and, both, lower, corners, feature, an, image, of, william, of, ockham, s, face
