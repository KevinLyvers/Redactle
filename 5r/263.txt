antiquity, medieval, early, modern, modern, iran, india, east, asia, karma, k, r, m, from, sanskrit, ipa, pali, kamma, is, an, ancient, indian, concept, that, refers, to, an, action, work, or, deed, and, its, effect, or, consequences, in, indian, religions, the, term, more, specifically, refers, to, a, principle, of, cause, and, effect, often, descriptively, called, the, principle, of, karma, wherein, individuals, intent, and, actions, cause, influence, their, future, effect, good, intent, and, good, deeds, contribute, to, good, karma, and, happier, rebirths, while, bad, intent, and, bad, deeds, contribute, to, bad, karma, and, worse, rebirths, in, some, scriptures, however, there, is, no, link, between, rebirth, and, karma, karma, is, often, misunderstood, as, fate, destiny, or, predetermination, the, concept, of, karma, is, closely, associated, with, the, idea, of, rebirth, in, many, schools, of, indian, religions, particularly, in, hinduism, buddhism, jainism, and, sikhism, as, well, as, taoism, in, these, schools, karma, in, the, present, affects, one, s, future, in, the, current, life, as, well, as, the, nature, and, quality, of, future, lives, one, s, sa, s, ra, this, concept, has, also, been, adopted, in, western, popular, culture, in, which, the, events, that, happen, after, a, person, s, actions, may, be, considered, natural, consequences, of, those, actions, the, term, karma, sanskrit, pali, kamma, refers, to, both, the, executed, deed, work, action, act, and, the, object, intent, wilhelm, halbfass, 2000, explains, karma, karman, by, contrasting, it, with, the, sanskrit, word, kriya, whereas, kriya, is, the, activity, along, with, the, steps, and, effort, in, action, karma, is, 1, the, executed, action, as, a, consequence, of, that, activity, as, well, as, 2, the, intention, of, the, actor, behind, an, executed, action, or, a, planned, action, described, by, some, scholars, as, metaphysical, residue, left, in, the, actor, a, good, action, creates, good, karma, as, does, good, intent, a, bad, action, creates, bad, karma, as, does, bad, intent, difficulty, in, arriving, at, a, definition, of, karma, arises, because, of, the, diversity, of, views, among, the, schools, of, hinduism, some, for, example, consider, karma, and, rebirth, linked, and, simultaneously, essential, some, consider, karma, but, not, rebirth, to, be, essential, and, a, few, discuss, and, conclude, karma, and, rebirth, to, be, flawed, fiction, buddhism, and, jainism, have, their, own, karma, precepts, thus, karma, has, not, one, but, multiple, definitions, and, different, meanings, it, is, a, concept, whose, meaning, importance, and, scope, varies, between, the, various, traditions, that, originated, in, india, and, various, schools, in, each, of, these, traditions, wendy, o, flaherty, claims, that, furthermore, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, regarding, whether, karma, is, a, theory, a, model, a, paradigm, a, metaphor, or, a, metaphysical, stance, karma, also, refers, to, a, conceptual, principle, that, originated, in, india, often, descriptively, called, the, principle, of, karma, and, sometimes, the, karma, theory, or, the, law, of, karma, in, the, context, of, theory, karma, is, complex, and, difficult, to, define, different, schools, of, indology, derive, different, definitions, for, the, concept, from, ancient, indian, texts, their, definition, is, some, combination, of, 1, causality, that, may, be, ethical, or, non, ethical, 2, ethicization, i, e, good, or, bad, actions, have, consequences, and, 3, rebirth, other, indologists, include, in, the, definition, that, which, explains, the, present, circumstances, of, an, individual, with, reference, to, his, or, her, actions, in, the, past, these, actions, may, be, those, in, a, person, s, current, life, or, in, some, schools, of, indian, traditions, possibly, actions, from, their, past, lives, furthermore, the, consequences, may, result, in, the, current, life, or, a, person, s, future, lives, the, law, of, karma, operates, independent, of, any, deity, or, any, process, of, divine, judgment, a, common, theme, to, theories, of, karma, is, its, principle, of, causality, this, relationship, between, karma, and, causality, is, a, central, motif, in, all, schools, of, hindu, buddhist, and, jain, thought, one, of, the, earliest, associations, of, karma, to, causality, occurs, in, the, brihadaranyaka, upanishad, verses, 4, 4, 5, 6, now, as, a, man, is, like, this, or, like, that, according, as, he, acts, and, according, as, he, behaves, so, will, he, be, a, man, of, good, acts, will, become, good, a, man, of, bad, acts, bad, he, becomes, pure, by, pure, deeds, bad, by, bad, deeds, and, here, they, say, that, a, person, consists, of, desires, and, as, is, his, desire, so, is, his, will, and, as, is, his, will, so, is, his, deed, and, whatever, deed, he, does, that, he, will, reap, the, theory, of, karma, as, causation, holds, that, 1, executed, actions, of, an, individual, affects, the, individual, and, the, life, he, or, she, lives, and, 2, the, intentions, of, an, individual, affects, the, individual, and, the, life, he, or, she, lives, disinterested, actions, or, unintentional, actions, do, not, have, the, same, positive, or, negative, karmic, effect, as, interested, and, intentional, actions, in, buddhism, for, example, actions, that, are, performed, or, arise, or, originate, without, any, bad, intent, such, as, covetousness, are, considered, non, existent, in, karmic, impact, or, neutral, in, influence, to, the, individual, another, causality, characteristic, shared, by, karmic, theories, is, that, like, deeds, lead, to, like, effects, thus, good, karma, produces, good, effect, on, the, actor, while, bad, karma, produces, bad, effect, this, effect, may, be, material, moral, or, emotional, that, is, one, s, karma, affects, both, one, s, happiness, and, unhappiness, the, effect, of, karma, need, not, be, immediate, the, effect, of, karma, can, be, later, in, one, s, current, life, and, in, some, schools, it, extends, to, future, lives, the, consequence, or, effects, of, one, s, karma, can, be, described, in, two, forms, phala, and, samskara, a, phala, lit, fruit, or, result, is, the, visible, or, invisible, effect, that, is, typically, immediate, or, within, the, current, life, in, contrast, a, samskara, sanskrit, is, an, invisible, effect, produced, inside, the, actor, because, of, the, karma, transforming, the, agent, and, affecting, his, or, her, ability, to, be, happy, or, unhappy, in, their, current, and, future, lives, the, theory, of, karma, is, often, presented, in, the, context, of, samskaras, karl, potter, and, harold, coward, suggest, that, karmic, principle, can, also, be, understood, as, a, principle, of, psychology, and, habit, karma, seeds, habits, v, san, and, habits, create, the, nature, of, man, karma, also, seeds, self, perception, and, perception, influences, how, one, experiences, life, events, both, habits, and, self, perception, affect, the, course, of, one, s, life, breaking, bad, habits, is, not, easy, it, requires, conscious, karmic, effort, thus, psyche, and, habit, according, to, potter, and, coward, link, karma, to, causality, in, ancient, indian, literature, the, idea, of, karma, may, be, compared, to, the, notion, of, a, person, s, character, as, both, are, an, assessment, of, the, person, and, determined, by, that, person, s, habitual, thinking, and, acting, the, second, theme, common, to, karma, theories, is, ethicization, this, begins, with, the, premise, that, every, action, has, a, consequence, which, will, come, to, fruition, in, either, this, life, or, a, future, life, thus, morally, good, acts, will, have, positive, consequences, whereas, bad, acts, will, produce, negative, results, an, individual, s, present, situation, is, thereby, explained, by, reference, to, actions, in, his, present, or, in, previous, lifetimes, karma, is, not, itself, reward, and, punishment, but, the, law, that, produces, consequence, wilhelm, halbfass, notes, that, good, karma, is, considered, as, dharma, and, leads, to, punya, merit, while, bad, karma, is, considered, adharma, and, leads, to, p, p, demerit, sin, reichenbach, 1988, suggests, that, the, theories, of, karma, are, an, ethical, theory, this, is, so, because, the, ancient, scholars, of, india, linked, intent, and, actual, action, to, the, merit, reward, demerit, and, punishment, a, theory, without, ethical, premise, would, be, a, pure, causal, relation, the, merit, or, reward, or, demerit, or, punishment, would, be, same, regardless, of, the, actor, s, intention, in, ethics, one, s, intentions, attitudes, and, desires, matter, in, the, evaluation, of, one, s, action, where, the, outcome, is, unintended, the, moral, responsibility, for, it, is, less, on, the, actor, even, though, causal, responsibility, may, be, the, same, regardless, a, karma, theory, considers, not, only, the, action, but, also, the, actor, s, intentions, attitude, and, desires, before, and, during, the, action, the, karma, concept, thus, encourages, each, person, to, seek, and, live, a, moral, life, as, well, as, avoid, an, immoral, life, the, meaning, and, significance, of, karma, is, thus, as, a, building, block, of, an, ethical, theory, the, third, common, theme, of, karma, theories, is, the, concept, of, reincarnation, or, the, cycle, of, rebirths, sa, s, ra, rebirth, is, a, fundamental, concept, of, hinduism, buddhism, jainism, and, sikhism, rebirth, or, sa, s, ra, is, the, concept, that, all, life, forms, go, through, a, cycle, of, reincarnation, that, is, a, series, of, births, and, rebirths, the, rebirths, and, consequent, life, may, be, in, different, realm, condition, or, form, the, karma, theories, suggest, that, the, realm, condition, and, form, depends, on, the, quality, and, quantity, of, karma, in, schools, that, believe, in, rebirth, every, living, being, s, soul, transmigrates, recycles, after, death, carrying, the, seeds, of, karmic, impulses, from, life, just, completed, into, another, life, and, lifetime, of, karmas, this, cycle, continues, indefinitely, except, for, those, who, consciously, break, this, cycle, by, reaching, moksha, those, who, break, the, cycle, reach, the, realm, of, gods, those, who, do, not, continue, in, the, cycle, the, concept, has, been, intensely, debated, in, ancient, literature, of, india, with, different, schools, of, indian, religions, considering, the, relevance, of, rebirth, as, either, essential, or, secondary, or, unnecessary, fiction, hiriyanna, 1949, suggests, rebirth, to, be, a, necessary, corollary, of, karma, yamunacharya, 1966, asserts, that, karma, is, a, fact, while, reincarnation, is, a, hypothesis, and, creel, 1986, suggests, that, karma, is, a, basic, concept, rebirth, is, a, derivative, concept, the, theory, of, karma, and, rebirth, raises, numerous, questions, such, as, how, when, and, why, did, the, cycle, start, in, the, first, place, what, is, the, relative, karmic, merit, of, one, karma, versus, another, and, why, and, what, evidence, is, there, that, rebirth, actually, happens, among, others, various, schools, of, hinduism, realized, these, difficulties, debated, their, own, formulations, some, reaching, what, they, considered, as, internally, consistent, theories, while, other, schools, modified, and, de, emphasized, it, a, few, schools, in, hinduism, such, as, charvakas, or, lokayata, abandoned, the, theory, of, karma, and, rebirth, altogether, schools, of, buddhism, consider, karma, rebirth, cycle, as, integral, to, their, theories, of, soteriology, the, vedic, sanskrit, word, k, rman, nominative, k, rma, means, work, or, deed, often, used, in, the, context, of, srauta, rituals, in, the, rigveda, the, word, occurs, some, 40, times, in, satapatha, brahmana, 1, 7, 1, 5, sacrifice, is, declared, as, the, greatest, of, works, satapatha, brahmana, 10, 1, 4, 1, associates, the, potential, of, becoming, immortal, amara, with, the, karma, of, the, agnicayana, sacrifice, in, the, early, vedic, literature, the, concept, of, karma, is, also, present, beyond, the, realm, of, rituals, or, sacrifices, the, vedic, language, includes, terms, for, sins, and, vices, such, as, gas, agha, enas, p, pa, p, pman, du, k, ta, as, well, as, for, virtues, and, merit, like, suk, ta, and, pu, ya, along, with, the, neutral, term, karman, whatever, good, deed, man, does, that, is, inside, the, vedi, and, whatever, evil, he, does, that, is, outside, the, vedi, the, verse, refers, to, the, evaluation, of, virtuous, and, sinful, actions, in, the, afterlife, regardless, of, their, application, in, rituals, whether, within, or, outside, the, vedi, the, concepts, of, good, and, evil, here, broadly, represent, merits, and, sins, what, evil, is, done, here, by, man, that, it, i, e, speech, brahman, makes, manifest, although, he, thinks, that, he, does, it, secretly, as, it, were, still, it, makes, it, manifest, verily, therefore, one, should, not, commit, evil, this, is, the, eternal, greatness, of, the, brahmin, he, does, not, increase, by, k, rman, nor, does, he, become, less, his, tman, knows, the, path, knowing, him, the, tman, one, is, not, polluted, by, evil, karman, the, vedic, words, for, action, and, merit, in, pre, upani, adic, texts, carry, moral, significance, and, are, not, solely, linked, to, ritual, practices, the, word, karman, simply, means, action, which, can, be, either, positive, or, negative, and, is, not, always, associated, with, religious, ceremonies, its, predominant, association, with, ritual, in, the, br, hma, a, texts, is, likely, a, reflection, of, their, ritualistic, nature, in, the, same, vein, suk, ta, and, subsequently, pu, ya, denotes, any, form, of, merit, whether, it, be, ethical, or, ritualistic, in, contrast, terms, such, as, p, pa, and, du, k, ta, consistently, represent, morally, wrong, actions, the, earliest, clear, discussion, of, the, karma, doctrine, is, in, the, upanishads, the, doctrine, occurs, here, in, the, context, of, a, discussion, of, the, fate, of, the, individual, after, death, for, example, causality, and, ethicization, is, stated, in, b, had, ra, yaka, upani, ad, 3, 2, 13, truly, one, becomes, good, through, good, deeds, and, evil, through, evil, deeds, some, authors, state, that, the, samsara, transmigration, and, karma, doctrine, may, be, non, vedic, and, the, ideas, may, have, developed, in, the, shramana, traditions, that, preceded, buddhism, and, jainism, others, state, that, some, of, the, complex, ideas, of, the, ancient, emerging, theory, of, karma, flowed, from, vedic, thinkers, to, buddhist, and, jain, thinkers, the, mutual, influences, between, the, traditions, is, unclear, and, likely, co, developed, many, philosophical, debates, surrounding, the, concept, are, shared, by, the, hindu, jain, and, buddhist, traditions, and, the, early, developments, in, each, tradition, incorporated, different, novel, ideas, for, example, buddhists, allowed, karma, transfer, from, one, person, to, another, and, sraddha, rites, but, had, difficulty, defending, the, rationale, in, contrast, hindu, schools, and, jainism, would, not, allow, the, possibility, of, karma, transfer, the, concept, of, karma, in, hinduism, developed, and, evolved, over, centuries, the, earliest, upanishads, began, with, the, questions, about, how, and, why, man, is, born, and, what, happens, after, death, as, answers, to, the, latter, the, early, theories, in, these, ancient, sanskrit, documents, include, pancagni, vidya, the, five, fire, doctrine, pitryana, the, cyclic, path, of, fathers, and, devayana, the, cycle, transcending, path, of, the, gods, those, who, perform, superficial, rituals, and, seek, material, gain, claimed, these, ancient, scholars, travel, the, way, of, their, fathers, and, recycle, back, into, another, life, those, who, renounce, these, go, into, the, forest, and, pursue, spiritual, knowledge, were, claimed, to, climb, into, the, higher, path, of, the, gods, it, is, these, who, break, the, cycle, and, are, not, reborn, with, the, composition, of, the, epics, the, common, man, s, introduction, to, dharma, in, hinduism, the, ideas, of, causality, and, essential, elements, of, the, theory, of, karma, were, being, recited, in, folk, stories, for, example, as, a, man, himself, sows, so, he, himself, reaps, no, man, inherits, the, good, or, evil, act, of, another, man, the, fruit, is, of, the, same, quality, as, the, action, the, 6th, chapter, of, the, anushasana, parva, the, teaching, book, the, 13th, book, of, the, mahabharata, opens, with, yudhishthira, asking, bhishma, is, the, course, of, a, person, s, life, already, destined, or, can, human, effort, shape, one, s, life, the, future, replies, bhishma, is, both, a, function, of, current, human, effort, derived, from, free, will, and, past, human, actions, that, set, the, circumstances, over, and, over, again, the, chapters, of, mahabharata, recite, the, key, postulates, of, karma, theory, that, is, intent, and, action, karma, has, consequences, karma, lingers, and, doesn, t, disappear, and, all, positive, or, negative, experiences, in, life, require, effort, and, intent, for, example, happiness, comes, due, to, good, actions, suffering, results, from, evil, actions, by, actions, all, things, are, obtained, by, inaction, nothing, whatsoever, is, enjoyed, if, one, s, action, bore, no, fruit, then, everything, would, be, of, no, avail, if, the, world, worked, from, fate, alone, it, would, be, neutralized, over, time, various, schools, of, hinduism, developed, many, different, definitions, of, karma, some, making, karma, appear, quite, deterministic, while, others, make, room, for, free, will, and, moral, agency, among, the, six, most, studied, schools, of, hinduism, the, theory, of, karma, evolved, in, different, ways, as, their, respective, scholars, reasoned, and, attempted, to, address, the, internal, inconsistencies, implications, and, issues, of, the, karma, doctrine, according, to, professor, wilhelm, halbfass, the, above, schools, illustrate, the, diversity, of, views, but, are, not, exhaustive, each, school, has, sub, schools, in, hinduism, such, as, that, of, non, dualism, and, dualism, under, vedanta, furthermore, there, are, other, schools, of, indian, philosophy, such, as, charvaka, or, lokayata, the, materialists, who, denied, the, theory, of, karma, rebirth, as, well, as, the, existence, of, god, to, this, non, vedic, school, the, properties, of, things, come, from, the, nature, of, things, causality, emerges, from, the, interaction, actions, and, nature, of, things, and, people, determinative, principles, such, as, karma, or, god, are, unnecessary, karma, and, karmaphala, are, fundamental, concepts, in, buddhism, which, explain, how, our, intentional, actions, keep, us, tied, to, rebirth, in, samsara, whereas, the, buddhist, path, as, exemplified, in, the, noble, eightfold, path, shows, us, the, way, out, of, samsara, the, cycle, of, rebirth, is, determined, by, karma, literally, action, karmaphala, wherein, phala, means, fruit, result, refers, to, the, effect, or, result, of, karma, the, similar, term, karmavipaka, wherein, vip, ka, means, ripening, refers, to, the, maturation, ripening, of, karma, in, the, buddhist, tradition, karma, refers, to, actions, driven, by, intention, cetan, a, deed, done, deliberately, through, body, speech, or, mind, which, leads, to, future, consequences, the, nibbedhika, sutta, anguttara, nikaya, 6, 63, intention, cetana, i, tell, you, is, kamma, intending, one, does, kamma, by, way, of, body, speech, intellect, how, these, intentional, actions, lead, to, rebirth, and, how, the, idea, of, rebirth, is, to, be, reconciled, with, the, doctrines, of, impermanence, and, no, self, is, a, matter, of, philosophical, inquiry, in, the, buddhist, traditions, for, which, several, solutions, have, been, proposed, in, early, buddhism, no, explicit, theory, of, rebirth, and, karma, is, worked, out, and, the, karma, doctrine, may, have, been, incidental, to, early, buddhist, soteriology, in, early, buddhism, rebirth, is, ascribed, to, craving, or, ignorance, unlike, that, of, jains, buddha, s, teaching, of, karma, is, not, strictly, deterministic, but, incorporated, circumstantial, factors, such, as, other, niyamas, it, is, not, a, rigid, and, mechanical, process, but, a, flexible, fluid, and, dynamic, process, there, is, no, set, linear, relationship, between, a, particular, action, and, its, results, the, karmic, effect, of, a, deed, is, not, determined, solely, by, the, deed, itself, but, also, by, the, nature, of, the, person, who, commits, the, deed, and, by, the, circumstances, in, which, it, is, committed, karmaphala, is, not, a, judgement, enforced, by, a, god, deity, or, other, supernatural, being, that, controls, the, affairs, of, the, cosmos, rather, karmaphala, is, the, outcome, of, a, natural, process, of, cause, and, effect, within, buddhism, the, real, importance, of, the, doctrine, of, karma, and, its, fruits, lies, in, the, recognition, of, the, urgency, to, put, a, stop, to, the, whole, process, the, acintita, sutta, warns, that, the, results, of, karma, is, one, of, the, four, incomprehensible, subjects, or, acinteyya, subjects, that, are, beyond, all, conceptualization, and, cannot, be, understood, with, logical, thought, or, reason, nichiren, buddhism, teaches, that, transformation, and, change, through, faith, and, practice, changes, adverse, karma, negative, causes, made, in, the, past, that, result, in, negative, results, in, the, present, and, future, to, positive, causes, for, benefits, in, the, future, in, jainism, karma, conveys, a, totally, different, meaning, from, that, commonly, understood, in, hindu, philosophy, and, western, civilization, jain, philosophy, is, one, of, the, oldest, indian, philosophy, that, completely, separates, body, matter, from, the, soul, pure, consciousness, in, jainism, karma, is, referred, to, as, karmic, dirt, as, it, consists, of, very, subtle, particles, of, matter, that, pervade, the, entire, universe, karmas, are, attracted, to, the, karmic, field, of, a, soul, due, to, vibrations, created, by, activities, of, mind, speech, and, body, as, well, as, various, mental, dispositions, hence, the, karmas, are, the, subtle, matter, surrounding, the, consciousness, of, a, soul, when, these, two, components, consciousness, and, karma, interact, we, experience, the, life, we, know, at, present, jain, texts, expound, that, seven, tattvas, truths, or, fundamentals, constitute, reality, these, are, according, to, padmanabh, jaini, this, emphasis, on, reaping, the, fruits, only, of, one, s, own, karma, was, not, restricted, to, the, jainas, both, hindus, and, buddhist, writers, have, produced, doctrinal, materials, stressing, the, same, point, each, of, the, latter, traditions, however, developed, practices, in, basic, contradiction, to, such, belief, in, addition, to, shrardha, the, ritual, hindu, offerings, by, the, son, of, deceased, we, find, among, hindus, widespread, adherence, to, the, notion, of, divine, intervention, in, ones, fate, while, buddhists, eventually, came, to, propound, such, theories, like, boon, granting, bodhisattvas, transfer, of, merit, and, like, only, the, jainas, have, been, absolutely, unwilling, to, allow, such, ideas, to, penetrate, their, community, despite, the, fact, that, there, must, have, been, tremendous, amount, of, social, pressure, on, them, to, do, so, the, relationship, between, the, soul, and, karma, states, padmanabh, jaini, can, be, explained, with, the, analogy, of, gold, like, gold, is, always, found, mixed, with, impurities, in, its, original, state, jainism, holds, that, the, soul, is, not, pure, at, its, origin, but, is, always, impure, and, defiled, like, natural, gold, one, can, exert, effort, and, purify, gold, similarly, jainism, states, that, the, defiled, soul, can, be, purified, by, proper, refining, methodology, karma, either, defiles, the, soul, further, or, refines, it, to, a, cleaner, state, and, this, affects, future, rebirths, karma, is, thus, an, efficient, cause, nimitta, in, jain, philosophy, but, not, the, material, cause, upadana, the, soul, is, believed, to, be, the, material, cause, the, key, points, where, the, theory, of, karma, in, jainism, can, be, stated, as, follows, there, are, eight, types, of, karma, which, attach, a, soul, to, samsara, the, cycle, of, birth, and, death, in, sikhism, all, living, beings, are, described, as, being, under, the, influence, of, the, three, qualities, of, maya, always, present, together, in, varying, mix, and, degrees, these, three, qualities, of, maya, bind, the, soul, to, the, body, and, to, the, earth, plane, above, these, three, qualities, is, the, eternal, time, due, to, the, influence, of, three, modes, of, maya, s, nature, jivas, individual, beings, perform, activities, under, the, control, and, purview, of, the, eternal, time, these, activities, are, called, karma, wherein, the, underlying, principle, is, that, karma, is, the, law, that, brings, back, the, results, of, actions, to, the, person, performing, them, this, life, is, likened, to, a, field, in, which, our, karma, is, the, seed, we, harvest, exactly, what, we, sow, no, less,

pure, being, in, this, life, and, others, feel, separated, this, is, the, law, of, karma, in, gurbani, sri, guru, granth, sahib, like, other, indian, and, oriental, schools, of, thought, the, gurbani, also, accepts, the, doctrines, of, karma, and, reincarnation, as, the, facts, of, nature, david, ownby, a, scholar, of, chinese, history, at, the, university, of, montreal, asserts, that, falun, gong, differs, from, buddhism, in, its, definition, of, the, term, karma, in, that, it, is, taken, not, as, a, process, of, award, and, punishment, but, as, an, exclusively, negative, term, the, chinese, term, de, or, virtue, is, reserved, for, what, might, otherwise, be, termed, good, karma, in, buddhism, karma, is, understood, as, the, source, of, all, suffering, what, buddhism, might, refer, to, as, bad, karma, according, to, li, hongzhi, the, founder, of, falun, gong, a, person, has, done, bad, things, over, his, many, lifetimes, and, for, people, this, results, in, misfortune, or, for, cultivators, its, karmic, obstacles, so, there, s, birth, aging, sickness, and, death, this, is, ordinary, karma, falun, gong, teaches, that, the, spirit, is, locked, in, the, cycle, of, rebirth, also, known, as, samsara, due, to, the, accumulation, of, karma, this, is, a, negative, black, substance, that, accumulates, in, other, dimensions, lifetime, after, lifetime, by, doing, bad, deeds, and, thinking, bad, thoughts, falun, gong, states, that, karma, is, the, reason, for, suffering, and, what, ultimately, blocks, people, from, the, truth, of, the, universe, and, attaining, enlightenment, at, the, same, time, karma, is, also, the, cause, of, one, s, continued, rebirth, and, suffering, li, says, that, due, to, accumulation, of, karma, the, human, spirit, upon, death, will, reincarnate, over, and, over, again, until, the, karma, is, paid, off, or, eliminated, through, cultivation, or, the, person, is, destroyed, due, to, the, bad, deeds, he, has, done, ownby, regards, the, concept, of, karma, as, a, cornerstone, to, individual, moral, behaviour, in, falun, gong, and, also, readily, traceable, to, the, christian, doctrine, of, one, reaps, what, one, sows, others, say, matthew, 5, 44, means, no, unbeliever, will, not, fully, reap, what, they, sow, until, they, are, judged, by, god, after, death, in, hell, ownby, says, falun, gong, is, differentiated, by, a, system, of, transmigration, although, in, which, each, organism, is, the, reincarnation, of, a, previous, life, form, its, current, form, having, been, determined, by, karmic, calculation, of, the, moral, qualities, of, the, previous, lives, lived, ownby, says, the, seeming, unfairness, of, manifest, inequities, can, then, be, explained, at, the, same, time, allowing, a, space, for, moral, behaviour, in, spite, of, them, in, the, same, vein, of, li, s, monism, matter, and, spirit, are, one, karma, is, identified, as, a, black, substance, which, must, be, purged, in, the, process, of, cultivation, according, to, li, human, beings, all, fell, here, from, the, many, dimensions, of, the, universe, they, no, longer, met, the, requirements, of, the, fa, at, their, given, levels, in, the, universe, and, thus, had, to, drop, down, just, as, we, have, said, before, the, heavier, one, s, mortal, attachments, the, further, down, one, drops, with, the, descent, continuing, until, one, arrives, at, the, state, of, ordinary, human, beings, he, says, that, in, the, eyes, of, higher, beings, the, purpose, of, human, life, is, not, merely, to, be, human, but, to, awaken, quickly, on, earth, a, setting, of, delusion, and, return, that, is, what, they, really, have, in, mind, they, are, opening, a, door, for, you, those, who, fail, to, return, will, have, no, choice, but, to, reincarnate, with, this, continuing, until, they, amass, a, huge, amount, of, karma, and, are, destroyed, ownby, regards, this, as, the, basis, for, falun, gong, s, apparent, opposition, to, practitioners, taking, medicine, when, ill, they, are, missing, an, opportunity, to, work, off, karma, by, allowing, an, illness, to, run, its, course, suffering, depletes, karma, or, to, fight, the, illness, through, cultivation, benjamin, penny, shares, this, interpretation, since, li, believes, that, karma, is, the, primary, factor, that, causes, sickness, in, people, penny, asks, if, disease, comes, from, karma, and, karma, can, be, eradicated, through, cultivation, of, xinxing, then, what, good, will, medicine, do, li, himself, states, that, he, is, not, forbidding, practitioners, from, taking, medicine, maintaining, that, what, i, m, doing, is, telling, people, the, relationship, between, practicing, cultivation, and, medicine, taking, li, also, states, that, an, everyday, person, needs, to, take, medicine, when, he, gets, sick, danny, schechter, 2001, quotes, a, falun, gong, student, who, says, it, is, always, an, individual, choice, whether, one, should, take, medicine, or, not, karma, is, an, important, concept, in, taoism, every, deed, is, tracked, by, deities, and, spirits, appropriate, rewards, or, retribution, follow, karma, just, like, a, shadow, follows, a, person, the, karma, doctrine, of, taoism, developed, in, three, stages, in, the, first, stage, causality, between, actions, and, consequences, was, adopted, with, supernatural, beings, keeping, track, of, everyone, s, karma, and, assigning, fate, ming, in, the, second, phase, transferability, of, karma, ideas, from, chinese, buddhism, were, expanded, and, a, transfer, or, inheritance, of, karmic, fate, from, ancestors, to, one, s, current, life, was, introduced, in, the, third, stage, of, karma, doctrine, development, ideas, of, rebirth, based, on, karma, were, added, one, could, be, reborn, either, as, another, human, being, or, another, animal, according, to, this, belief, in, the, third, stage, additional, ideas, were, introduced, for, example, rituals, repentance, and, offerings, at, taoist, temples, were, encouraged, as, it, could, alleviate, karmic, burden, interpreted, as, musubi, a, view, of, karma, is, recognized, in, shinto, as, a, means, of, enriching, empowering, and, affirming, life, musubi, has, fundamental, significance, in, shinto, because, creative, development, forms, the, basis, of, the, shinto, worldview, many, deities, are, connected, to, musubi, and, have, it, in, their, names, one, of, the, significant, controversies, with, the, karma, doctrine, is, whether, it, always, implies, destiny, and, its, implications, on, free, will, this, controversy, is, also, referred, to, as, the, moral, agency, problem, the, controversy, is, not, unique, to, karma, doctrine, but, also, found, in, some, form, in, monotheistic, religions, the, free, will, controversy, can, be, outlined, in, three, parts, the, explanations, and, replies, to, the, above, free, will, problem, vary, by, the, specific, school, of, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, the, schools, of, hinduism, such, as, yoga, and, advaita, vedanta, that, have, emphasized, current, life, over, the, dynamics, of, karma, residue, moving, across, past, lives, allow, free, will, their, argument, as, well, of, other, schools, are, threefold, other, schools, of, hinduism, as, well, as, buddhism, and, jainism, that, do, consider, cycle, of, rebirths, central, to, their, beliefs, and, that, karma, from, past, lives, affects, one, s, present, believe, that, both, free, will, cetan, and, karma, can, co, exist, however, their, answers, have, not, persuaded, all, scholars, another, issue, with, the, theory, of, karma, is, that, it, is, psychologically, indeterminate, suggests, obeyesekere, 1968, that, is, if, no, one, can, know, what, their, karma, was, in, previous, lives, and, if, the, karma, from, past, lives, can, determine, one, s, future, then, the, individual, is, psychologically, unclear, what, if, anything, he, or, she, can, do, now, to, shape, the, future, be, more, happy, or, reduce, suffering, if, something, goes, wrong, such, as, sickness, or, failure, at, work, the, individual, is, unclear, if, karma, from, past, lives, was, the, cause, or, the, sickness, was, caused, by, curable, infection, and, the, failure, was, caused, by, something, correctable, this, psychological, indeterminacy, problem, is, also, not, unique, to, the, theory, of, karma, it, is, found, in, every, religion, adopting, the, premise, that, god, has, a, plan, or, in, some, way, influences, human, events, as, with, the, karma, and, free, will, problem, above, schools, that, insist, on, primacy, of, rebirths, face, the, most, controversy, their, answers, to, the, psychological, indeterminacy, issue, are, the, same, as, those, for, addressing, the, free, will, problem, some, schools, of, indian, religions, particularly, within, buddhism, allow, transfer, of, karma, merit, and, demerit, from, one, person, to, another, this, transfer, is, an, exchange, of, non, physical, quality, just, like, an, exchange, of, physical, goods, between, two, human, beings, the, practice, of, karma, transfer, or, even, its, possibility, is, controversial, karma, transfer, raises, questions, similar, to, those, with, substitutionary, atonement, and, vicarious, punishment, it, undermines, the, ethical, foundations, and, dissociates, the, causality, and, ethicization, in, the, theory, of, karma, from, the, moral, agent, proponents, of, some, buddhist, schools, suggest, that, the, concept, of, karma, merit, transfer, encourages, religious, giving, and, that, such, transfers, are, not, a, mechanism, to, transfer, bad, karma, i, e, demerit, from, one, person, to, another, in, hinduism, sraddha, rites, during, funerals, have, been, labelled, as, karma, merit, transfer, ceremonies, by, a, few, scholars, a, claim, disputed, by, others, other, schools, in, hinduism, such, as, the, yoga, and, advaita, vedantic, philosophies, and, jainism, hold, that, karma, can, not, be, transferred, there, has, been, an, ongoing, debate, about, karma, theory, and, how, it, answers, the, problem, of, evil, and, related, problem, of, theodicy, the, problem, of, evil, is, a, significant, question, debated, in, monotheistic, religions, with, two, beliefs, the, problem, of, evil, is, then, stated, in, formulations, such, as, why, does, the, omnibenevolent, omniscient, and, omnipotent, god, allow, any, evil, and, suffering, to, exist, in, the, world, sociologist, max, weber, extended, the, problem, of, evil, to, eastern, traditions, the, problem, of, evil, in, the, context, of, karma, has, been, long, discussed, in, eastern, traditions, both, in, theistic, and, non, theistic, schools, for, example, in, uttara, m, m, s, sutras, book, 2, chapter, 1, the, 8th, century, arguments, by, adi, sankara, in, brahma, sutra, bhasya, where, he, posits, that, god, cannot, reasonably, be, the, cause, of, the, world, because, there, exists, moral, evil, inequality, cruelty, and, suffering, in, the, world, and, the, 11th, century, theodicy, discussion, by, ramanuja, in, sri, bhasya, epics, such, as, the, mahabharata, for, example, suggest, three, prevailing, theories, in, ancient, india, as, to, why, good, and, evil, exist, one, being, that, everything, is, ordained, by, god, another, being, karma, and, a, third, citing, chance, events, yadrccha, the, mahabharata, which, includes, hindu, deity, vishnu, in, the, avatar, of, krishna, as, one, of, the, central, characters, debates, the, nature, and, existence, of, suffering, from, these, three, perspectives, and, includes, a, theory, of, suffering, as, arising, from, an, interplay, of, chance, events, such, as, floods, and, other, events, of, nature, circumstances, created, by, past, human, actions, and, the, current, desires, volitions, dharma, adharma, and, current, actions, purusakara, of, people, however, while, karma, theory, in, the, mahabharata, presents, alternative, perspectives, on, the, problem, of, evil, and, suffering, it, offers, no, conclusive, answer, other, scholars, suggest, that, nontheistic, indian, religious, traditions, do, not, assume, an, omnibenevolent, creator, and, some, theistic, schools, do, not, define, or, characterize, their, god, s, as, monotheistic, western, religions, do, and, the, deities, have, colorful, complex, personalities, the, indian, deities, are, personal, and, cosmic, facilitators, and, in, some, schools, conceptualized, like, plato, s, demiurge, therefore, the, problem, of, theodicy, in, many, schools, of, major, indian, religions, is, not, significant, or, at, least, is, of, a, different, nature, than, in, western, religions, many, indian, religions, place, greater, emphasis, on, developing, the, karma, principle, for, first, cause, and, innate, justice, with, man, as, focus, rather, than, developing, religious, principles, with, the, nature, and, powers, of, god, and, divine, judgment, as, focus, some, scholars, particularly, of, the, nyaya, school, of, hinduism, and, sankara, in, brahma, sutra, bhasya, have, posited, that, karma, doctrine, implies, existence, of, god, who, administers, and, affects, the, person, s, environment, given, that, person, s, karma, but, then, acknowledge, that, it, makes, karma, as, violable, contingent, and, unable, to, address, the, problem, of, evil, arthur, herman, states, that, karma, transmigration, theory, solves, all, three, historical, formulations, to, the, problem, of, evil, while, acknowledging, the, theodicy, insights, of, sankara, and, ramanuja, some, theistic, indian, religions, such, as, sikhism, suggest, evil, and, suffering, are, a, human, phenomenon, and, arises, from, the, karma, of, individuals, in, other, theistic, schools, such, as, those, in, hinduism, particularly, its, nyaya, school, karma, is, combined, with, dharma, and, evil, is, explained, as, arising, from, human, actions, and, intent, that, is, in, conflict, with, dharma, in, nontheistic, religions, such, as, buddhism, jainism, and, the, mimamsa, school, of, hinduism, karma, theory, is, used, to, explain, the, cause, of, evil, as, well, as, to, offer, distinct, ways, to, avoid, or, be, unaffected, by, evil, in, the, world, those, schools, of, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, that, rely, on, karma, rebirth, theory, have, been, critiqued, for, their, theological, explanation, of, suffering, in, children, by, birth, as, the, result, of, his, or, her, sins, in, a, past, life, others, disagree, and, consider, the, critique, as, flawed, and, a, misunderstanding, of, the, karma, theory, western, culture, influenced, by, christianity, holds, a, notion, similar, to, karma, as, demonstrated, in, the, phrase, what, goes, around, comes, around, mary, jo, meadow, suggests, karma, is, akin, to, christian, notions, of, sin, and, its, effects, she, states, that, the, christian, teaching, on, a, last, judgment, according, to, one, s, charity, is, a, teaching, on, karma, christianity, also, teaches, morals, such, as, one, reaps, what, one, sows, galatians, 6, 7, and, live, by, the, sword, die, by, the, sword, matthew, 26, 52, most, scholars, however, consider, the, concept, of, last, judgment, as, different, from, karma, with, karma, as, an, ongoing, process, that, occurs, every, day, in, one, s, life, while, last, judgment, by, contrast, is, a, one, time, review, at, the, end, of, life, there, is, a, concept, in, judaism, called, in, hebrew, midah, k, neged, midah, which, is, often, translated, as, measure, for, measure, the, concept, is, used, not, so, much, in, matters, of, law, but, rather, in, matters, of, divine, retribution, for, a, person, s, actions, david, wolpe, compared, midah, k, neged, midah, to, karma, carl, jung, once, opined, on, unresolved, emotions, and, the, synchronicity, of, karma, when, an, inner, situation, is, not, made, conscious, it, appears, outside, as, fate, popular,

of, the, theosophical, society, in, this, conception, karma, was, a, precursor, to, the, neopagan, law, of, return, or, threefold, law, the, idea, that, the, beneficial, or, harmful, effects, one, has, on, the, world, will, return, to, oneself, colloquially, this, may, be, summed, up, as, what, goes, around, comes, around, theosophist, i, k, taimni, wrote, karma, is, nothing, but, the, law, of,
