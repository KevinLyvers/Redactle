a, cult, is, a, group, requiring, unwavering, devotion, to, a, set, of, beliefs, and, practices, which, are, considered, deviant, outside, the, norms, of, society, which, is, typically, led, by, a, charismatic, and, self, appointed, leader, who, tightly, controls, its, members, it, is, in, some, contexts, a, pejorative, term, also, used, for, new, religious, movements, and, other, social, groups, which, are, defined, by, their, unusual, religious, spiritual, or, philosophical, beliefs, and, rituals, or, their, common, interest, in, a, particular, person, object, or, goal, this, sense, of, the, term, is, weakly, defined, having, divergent, definitions, both, in, popular, culture, and, academia, and, has, also, been, an, ongoing, source, of, contention, among, scholars, across, several, fields, of, study, 348, 356, an, older, sense, of, the, word, which, is, not, pejorative, involves, a, set, of, religious, devotional, practices, that, is, conventional, within, its, culture, is, related, to, a, particular, figure, and, is, frequently, associated, with, a, particular, place, references, to, the, imperial, cult, of, ancient, rome, for, example, use, the, word, in, this, sense, a, derived, sense, of, excessive, devotion, arose, in, the, 19th, century, beginning, in, the, 1930s, cults, became, an, object, of, sociological, study, within, the, context, of, the, study, of, religious, behavior, since, the, 1940s, the, christian, countercult, movement, has, opposed, some, sects, and, new, religious, movements, labeling, them, cults, because, of, their, unorthodox, beliefs, since, the, 1970s, the, secular, anti, cult, movement, has, opposed, certain, groups, and, as, a, reaction, to, acts, of, violence, frequently, charged, those, cults, with, practicing, brainwashing, there, are, thousands, of, cults, around, the, world, groups, labelled, cults, range, in, size, from, local, groups, with, a, few, members, to, international, organizations, with, millions, sociological, classifications, of, religious, movements, may, identify, a, cult, as, a, social, group, with, socially, deviant, or, novel, beliefs, and, practices, although, this, is, often, unclear, other, researchers, present, a, less, organized, picture, of, cults, saying, that, they, arise, spontaneously, around, novel, beliefs, and, practices, cults, especially, nonreligious, ones, have, also, been, called, high, control, groups, and, compared, to, miniature, totalitarian, political, systems, in, the, english, speaking, world, the, term, cult, often, carries, derogatory, connotations, in, this, sense, it, has, been, considered, a, subjective, term, used, as, an, ad, hominem, attack, against, groups, with, differing, doctrines, or, practices, as, such, religion, scholar, megan, goodwin, has, defined, the, term, cult, when, it, is, used, by, the, layperson, as, often, being, shorthand, for, a, religion, i, don, t, like, in, the, 1970s, with, the, rise, of, secular, anti, cult, movements, scholars, though, not, the, general, public, began, to, abandon, the, use, of, the, term, cult, according, to, the, oxford, handbook, of, new, religious, movements, by, the, end, of, the, decade, the, term, new, religions, would, virtually, replace, the, term, cult, to, describe, all, of, those, leftover, groups, that, did, not, fit, easily, under, the, label, of, church, or, sect, sociologist, amy, ryan, 2000, argues, for, the, need, to, differentiate, those, groups, that, may, be, dangerous, from, groups, that, are, more, benign, ryan, notes, the, sharp, differences, between, definitions, offered, by, cult, opponents, who, tend, to, focus, on, negative, characteristics, and, those, offered, by, sociologists, who, aim, to, create, definitions, that, are, value, free, the, movements, themselves, may, have, different, definitions, of, religion, as, well, george, chryssides, also, cites, a, need, to, develop, better, definitions, to, allow, for, common, ground, in, the, debate, casino, 1999, presents, the, issue, as, crucial, to, international, human, rights, laws, limiting, the, definition, of, religion, may, interfere, with, freedom, of, religion, while, too, broad, a, definition, may, give, some, dangerous, or, abusive, groups, a, limitless, excuse, for, avoiding, all, unwanted, legal, obligations, a, new, religious, movement, nrm, is, a, religious, community, or, spiritual, group, of, modern, origins, since, the, mid, 19th, century, which, has, a, peripheral, place, within, its, society, s, dominant, religious, culture, nrms, can, be, novel, in, origin, or, part, of, a, wider, religion, in, which, case, they, are, distinct, from, pre, existing, denominations, in, 1999, eileen, barker, estimated, that, nrms, of, which, some, but, not, all, have, been, labelled, as, cults, number, in, the, tens, of, thousands, worldwide, and, that, the, great, majority, of, which, have, only, a, few, members, some, have, thousands, and, only, very, few, have, more, than, a, million, in, 2007, religious, scholar, elijah, siegler, commented, that, although, no, nrm, had, become, the, dominant, faith, in, any, country, many, of, the, concepts, which, they, had, first, introduced, often, referred, to, as, new, age, ideas, have, become, part, of, worldwide, mainstream, culture, 51, high, control, groups, may, encourage, their, believers, to, disengage, from, so, called, world, affairs, shun, or, limit, interaction, with, nonbelievers, and, maintain, a, distinct, identity, separate, from, mainstream, culture, reinforcing, group, cohesion, and, control, the, emphasis, on, isolation, and, exclusivity, can, likewise, contribute, to, the, group, s, sense, of, identity, and, reinforce, adherence, to, its, beliefs, and, practices, sociologist, max, weber, 1864, 1920, is, an, important, theorist, in, the, academic, study, of, cults, which, often, draws, on, his, theorizations, of, charismatic, authority, and, of, the, distinction, between, churches, and, sects, weber, theorizes, that, charismatic, leadership, often, follow, the, routinization, of, charisma, these, ideas, have, been, used, to, theorize, the, dynamics, of, groups, that, have, been, labelled, cults, including, the, people, s, temple, and, the, rajneesh, movement, the, concept, of, a, cult, as, a, sociological, classification, was, introduced, in, 1932, by, american, sociologist, howard, p, becker, as, an, expansion, of, german, theologian, ernst, troeltsch, s, own, church, sect, typology, troeltsch, s, aim, was, to, distinguish, between, three, main, types, of, religious, behaviour, churchly, sectarian, and, mystical, becker, further, bisected, troeltsch, s, first, two, categories, church, was, split, into, ecclesia, and, denomination, and, sect, into, sect, and, cult, like, troeltsch, s, mystical, religion, becker, s, cult, refers, to, small, religious, groups, that, lack, in, organization, and, emphasize, the, private, nature, of, personal, beliefs, later, sociological, formulations, built, on, such, characteristics, placing, an, additional, emphasis, on, cults, as, deviant, religious, groups, deriving, their, inspiration, from, outside, of, the, predominant, religious, culture, 349, this, is, often, thought, to, lead, to, a, high, degree, of, tension, between, the, group, and, the, more, mainstream, culture, surrounding, it, a, characteristic, shared, with, religious, sects, according, to, this, sociological, terminology, sects, are, products, of, religious, schism, and, therefore, maintain, a, continuity, with, traditional, beliefs, and, practices, whereas, cults, arise, spontaneously, around, novel, beliefs, and, practices, in, the, early, 1960s, sociologist, john, lofland, living, with, south, korean, missionary, young, oon, kim, and, some, of, the, first, american, unification, church, members, in, california, studied, their, activities, in, trying, to, promote, their, beliefs, and, win, new, members, lofland, noted, that, most, of, their, efforts, were, ineffective, and, that, most, of, the, people, who, joined, did, so, because, of, personal, relationships, with, other, members, often, family, relationships, lofland, published, his, findings, in, 1964, as, a, doctoral, thesis, entitled, the, world, savers, a, field, study, of, cult, processes, and, in, 1966, in, book, form, by, prentice, hall, as, doomsday, cult, a, study, of, conversion, proselytization, and, maintenance, of, faith, it, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, and, widely, cited, studies, of, the, process, of, religious, conversion, sociologist, roy, wallis, 1945, 1990, argued, that, a, cult, is, characterized, by, epistemological, individualism, meaning, that, the, cult, has, no, clear, locus, of, final, authority, beyond, the, individual, member, cults, according, to, wallis, are, generally, described, as, oriented, towards, the, problems, of, individuals, loosely, structured, tolerant, non, exclusive, making, few, demands, on, members, without, possessing, a, clear, distinction, between, members, and, non, members, having, a, rapid, turnover, of, membership, and, as, being, transient, collectives, with, vague, boundaries, and, fluctuating, belief, systems, wallis, asserts, that, cults, emerge, from, the, cultic, milieu, j, gordon, melton, stated, that, in, 1970, one, could, count, the, number, of, active, researchers, on, new, religions, on, one, s, hands, however, james, r, lewis, writes, that, the, meteoric, growth, in, this, field, of, study, can, be, attributed, to, the, cult, controversy, of, the, early, 1970s, because, of, a, wave, of, nontraditional, religiosity, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, academics, perceived, new, religious, movements, as, different, phenomena, from, previous, religious, innovations, in, 1978, bruce, campbell, noted, that, cults, are, associated, with, beliefs, in, a, divine, element, in, the, individual, it, is, either, soul, self, or, true, self, cults, are, inherently, ephemeral, and, loosely, organized, there, is, a, major, theme, in, many, of, the, recent, works, that, show, the, relationship, between, cults, and, mysticism, campbell, describing, cults, as, non, traditional, religious, groups, based, on, belief, in, a, divine, element, in, the, individual, brings, two, major, types, of, such, to, attention, mystical, and, instrumental, dividing, cults, into, either, occult, or, metaphysical, assembly, there, is, also, a, third, type, the, service, oriented, as, campbell, states, that, the, kinds, of, stable, forms, which, evolve, in, the, development, of, religious, organization, will, bear, a, significant, relationship, to, the, content, of, the, religious, experience, of, the, founder, or, founders, dick, anthony, a, forensic, psychologist, known, for, his, criticism, of, brainwashing, theory, of, conversion, has, defended, some, so, called, cults, and, in, 1988, argued, that, involvement, in, such, movements, may, often, have, beneficial, rather, than, harmful, effects, saying, that, here, s, a, large, research, literature, published, in, mainstream, journals, on, the, mental, health, effects, of, new, religions, for, the, most, part, the, effects, seem, to, be, positive, in, any, way, that, s, measurable, in, their, 1996, book, theory, of, religion, american, sociologists, rodney, stark, and, william, sims, bainbridge, propose, that, the, formation, of, cults, can, be, explained, through, the, rational, choice, theory, in, the, future, of, religion, they, comment, that, in, the, beginning, all, religions, are, obscure, tiny, deviant, cult, movements, according, to, marc, galanter, professor, of, psychiatry, at, nyu, typical, reasons, why, people, join, cults, include, a, search, for, community, and, a, spiritual, quest, stark, and, bainbridge, in, discussing, the, process, by, which, individuals, join, new, religious, groups, have, even, questioned, the, utility, of, the, concept, of, conversion, suggesting, that, affiliation, is, a, more, useful, concept, destructive, cult, generally, refers, to, groups, whose, members, have, through, deliberate, action, physically, injured, or, killed, other, members, of, their, own, group, or, other, people, the, ontario, consultants, on, religious, tolerance, specifically, limits, the, use, of, the, term, to, religious, groups, that, have, caused, or, are, liable, to, cause, loss, of, life, among, their, membership, or, the, general, public, psychologist, michael, langone, executive, director, of, the, anti, cult, group, international, cultic, studies, association, defines, a, destructive, cult, as, a, highly, manipulative, group, which, exploits, and, sometimes, physically, and, or, psychologically, damages, members, and, recruits, john, gordon, clark, argued, that, totalitarian, systems, of, governance, and, an, emphasis, on, money, making, are, characteristics, of, a, destructive, cult, in, cults, and, the, family, the, authors, cite, shapiro, who, defines, a, destructive, cultism, as, a, sociopathic, syndrome, whose, distinctive, qualities, include, behavioral, and, personality, changes, loss, of, personal, identity, cessation, of, scholastic, activities, estrangement, from, family, disinterest, in, society, and, pronounced, mental, control, and, enslavement, by, cult, leaders, in, the, opinion, of, sociology, professor, benjamin, zablocki, of, rutgers, university, destructive, cults, are, at, high, risk, of, becoming, abusive, to, members, stating, that, such, is, in, part, due, to, members, adulation, of, charismatic, leaders, contributing, to, the, leaders, becoming, corrupted, by, power, according, to, barrett, the, most, common, accusation, made, against, destructive, cults, is, sexual, abuse, according, to, kranenborg, some, groups, are, risky, when, they, advise, their, members, not, to, use, regular, medical, care, this, may, extend, to, physical, and, psychological, harm, writing, about, bruderhof, communities, in, the, book, misunderstanding, cults, searching, for, objectivity, in, a, controversial, field, julius, h, rubin, said, that, american, religious, innovation, created, an, unending, diversity, of, sects, these, new, religious, movements, gathered, new, converts, and, issued, challenges, to, the, wider, society, not, infrequently, public, controversy, contested, narratives, and, litigation, result, in, his, work, cults, in, context, author, lorne, l, dawson, writes, that, although, the, unification, church, has, not, been, shown, to, be, violent, or, volatile, it, has, been, described, as, a, destructive, cult, by, anticult, crusaders, in, 2002, the, german, government, was, held, by, the, federal, constitutional, court, to, have, defamed, the, osho, movement, by, referring, to, it, among, other, things, as, a, destructive, cult, with, no, factual, basis, some, researchers, have, criticized, the, term, destructive, cult, writing, that, it, is, used, to, describe, groups, which, are, not, necessarily, harmful, in, nature, to, themselves, or, others, in, his, book, understanding, new, religious, movements, john, a, saliba, writes, that, the, term, is, overgeneralized, saliba, sees, the, peoples, temple, as, the, paradigm, of, a, destructive, cult, where, those, that, use, the, term, are, implying, that, other, groups, will, also, commit, mass, suicide, doomsday, cult, is, an, expression, which, is, used, to, describe, groups, that, believe, in, apocalypticism, and, millenarianism, and, it, can, also, be, used, to, refer, both, to, groups, that, predict, disaster, and, groups, that, attempt, to, bring, it, about, in, the, 1950s, american, social, psychologist, leon, festinger, and, his, colleagues, observed, members, of, a, small, ufo, religion, called, the, seekers, for, several, months, and, recorded, their, conversations, both, prior, to, and, after, a, failed, prophecy, from, their, charismatic, leader, their, work, was, later, published, in, the, book, when, prophecy, fails, a, social, and, psychological, study, of, a, modern, group, that, predicted, the, destruction, of, the, world, in, the, late, 1980s, doomsday, cults, were, a, major, topic, of, news, reports, with, some, reporters, and, commentators, considering, them, a, serious, threat, to, society, a, 1997, psychological, study, by, festinger, riecken, and, schachter, found, that, people, turned, to, a, cataclysmic, world, view, after, they, had, repeatedly, failed, to, find, meaning, in, mainstream, movements, people, also, strive, to, find, meaning, in, global, events, such, as, the, turn, of, the, millennium, when, many, predicted, it, prophetically, marked, the, end, of, an, age, and, thus, the, end, of, the, world, an, ancient, mayan, calendar, ended, at, the, 2012, years, sparking, the, 2012, phenomenon, as, many, anticipated, catastrophic, disasters, would, rock, the, earth, in, 1995, members, of, the, japanese, doomsday, cult, aum, shinrikyo, murdered, a, number, of, people, during, a, sarin, attack, on, the, tokyo, subway, aum, shinrikyo, has, been, involved, in, several, violent, incidents, in, 1990, members, of, aum, shinrikyo, murdered, the, family, of, a, lawyer, who, was, involved, in, a, legal, action, against, them, there, were, several, other, murders, besides, that, brought, the, death, toll, associated, with, this, group, s, acts, to, 27, some, were, surprised, by, the, group, s, ability, to, recruit, educated, young, people, scholars, have, attempted, to, explain, the, cause, of, this, as, feelings, of, social, alienation, that, make,

political, cults, mostly, advocating, far, left, or, far, right, agendas, have, received, some, attention, from, journalists, and, scholars, in, their, 2000, book, on, the, edge, political, cults, right, and, left, dennis, tourish, and, tim, wohlforth, discuss, about, a, dozen, organizations, in, the, united, states, and, great, britain, that, they, characterize, as, cults, in, a, separate, article, tourish, says, that, in, his, usage, the, word, cult, is, not, a, term, of, abuse, as, this, paper, tries, to, explain, it, is, nothing, more, than, a, shorthand, expression, for, a, particular, set, of, practices, that, have, been, observed, in, a, variety, of, dysfunctional, organisations, in, 1990, lucy, patrick, commented, although, we, live, in, a, democracy, cult, behavior, manifests, itself, in, our, unwillingness, to, question, the, judgment, of, our, leaders, our, tendency, to, devalue, outsiders, and, to, avoid, dissent, we, can, overcome, cult, behavior, he, says, by, recognizing, that, we, have, dependency, needs, that, are, inappropriate, for, mature, people, by, increasing, anti, authoritarian, education, and, by, encouraging, personal, autonomy, and, the, free, exchange, of, ideas, followers, of, ayn, rand, have, been, characterized, as, a, cult, by, economist, murray, rothbard, and, later, by, michael, shermer, the, core, group, around, rand, was, called, the, collective, which, is, now, defunct, the, chief, group, which, is, disseminating, rand, s, ideas, today, is, the, ayn, rand, institute, although, the, collective, advocated, an, individualist, philosophy, rothbard, claimed, that, it, was, organized, in, the, manner, of, a, leninist, organization, the, larouche, movement, is, a, political, and, cultural, network, promoting, the, late, lyndon, larouche, and, his, ideas, it, has, included, many, organizations, and, companies, around, the, world, which, campaign, gather, information, and, publish, books, and, periodicals, it, has, been, called, cult, like, by, the, new, york, times, the, movement, originated, within, the, radical, leftist, student, politics, of, the, 1960s, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, hundreds, of, candidates, ran, in, state, democratic, primaries, in, the, united, states, on, the, larouche, platform, while, lyndon, larouche, repeatedly, campaigned, for, presidential, nomination, however, the, larouche, movement, is, often, considered, far, right, during, its, peak, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, larouche, movement, developed, a, private, intelligence, agency, and, contacts, with, foreign, governments, an, argentine, esoteric, group, founded, in, 1957, by, jorge, angel, livraga, a, former, theosophist, the, new, acropolis, cultural, association, has, been, described, by, scholars, as, an, ultra, conservative, neo, fascist, and, white, supremacist, paramilitary, group, the, group, itself, denies, such, descriptions, founded, by, north, korea, born, sun, myung, moon,

between, democracy, and, communism, as, the, final, conflict, between, god, and, satan, with, divided, korea, as, its, primary, front, line, soon, after, its, founding, the, unification, church, began, supporting, anti, communist, organizations, including, the, world, league, for, freedom, and, democracy, founded, in, 1966, in, taipei, republic, of, china, taiwan, by, chiang, kai, shek, and,

religious, sect, can, be, considered, a, cult, if, its, beliefs, involve, a, denial, of, what, they, view, as, any, of, the, essential, christian, teachings, such, as, salvation, the, trinity, jesus, himself, as, a, person, the, ministry, of, jesus, the, miracles, of, jesus, the, crucifixion, the, resurrection, of, christ, the, second, coming, and, the, rapture, countercult, literature, usually,

secular, anti, cult, movement, acm, often, acted, on, behalf, of, relatives, of, cult, converts, who, did, not, believe, their, loved, ones, could, have, altered, their, lives, so, drastically, by, their, own, free, will, a, few, psychologists, and, sociologists, working, in, this, field, suggested, that, brainwashing, techniques, were, used, to, maintain, the, loyalty, of, cult, members, the, belief, that, cults, brainwashed, their, members, became, a, unifying, theme, among, cult, critics, and, in, the, more, extreme, corners, of, the, anti, cult, movement, techniques, like, the, sometimes, forceful, deprogramming, of, cult, members, was, practised, secular, cult, opponents, belonging, to, the, anti, cult, movement, usually, define, a, cult, as, a, group, that, tends, to, manipulate, exploit, and, control, its, members, specific, factors, in, cult, behaviour, are, said, to, include, manipulative, and, authoritarian, mind, control, over, members, communal, and, totalistic, organization, aggressive, proselytizing, systematic, programs, of, indoctrination, and, perpetuation, in, middle, class, communities, in, the, mass, media, and, among, average, citizens, cult, gained, an, increasingly, negative, connotation, becoming, associated, with, things, like, kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological, abuse, sexual, abuse, and, other, criminal, activity, and, mass, suicide, while, most, of, these, negative, qualities, usually, have, real, documented, precedents, in, the, activities, of, a, very, small, minority, of, new, religious, groups, mass, culture, often, extends, them, to, any, religious, group, viewed, as, culturally, deviant, however, peaceful, or, law, abiding, it, may, be, 348, 356, while, some, psychologists, were, receptive, to, these, theories, sociologists, were, for, the, most, part, sceptical, of, their, ability, to, explain, conversion, to, nrms, in, the, late, 1980s, psychologists, and, sociologists, started, to, abandon, theories, like, brainwashing, and, mind, control, while, scholars, may, believe, that, various, less, dramatic, coercive, psychological, mechanisms, could, influence, group, members, they, came, to, see, conversion, to, new, religious, movements, principally, as, an, act, of, a, rational, choice, because, of, the, increasingly, pejorative, use, of, the, word, cult, since, the, 1970s, some, academics, argue, that, its, use, is, prejudicial, and, should, be, avoided, particularly, according, to, richardson, in, scholarly, literature, and, legal, proceedings, involving, an, issue, related, to, an, unconventional, religious, movement, 348, 356, catherine, wessinger, loyola, university, new, orleans, has, stated, that, the, word, cult, represents, just, as, much, prejudice, and, antagonism, as, racial, slurs, or, derogatory, words, for, women, and, homosexuals, she, argued, that, it, is, important, for, people, to, become, aware, of, the, bigotry, conveyed, by, the, word, drawing, attention, to, the, way, it, dehumanizes, the, group, s, members, and, their, children, labelling, a, group, as, subhuman, she, says, becomes, a, justification, for, violence, against, it, she, also, says, that, labelling, a, group, a, cult, makes, people, feel, safe, because, the, violence, associated, with, religion, is, split, off, from, conventional, religions, projected, onto, others, and, imagined, to, involve, only, aberrant, groups, according, to, her, this, fails, to, take, into, account, that, child, abuse, sexual, abuse, financial, extortion, and, warfare, have, also, been, committed, by, believers, of, mainstream, religions, but, the, pejorative, cult, stereotype, makes, it, easier, to, avoid, confronting, this, uncomfortable, fact, the, application, of, the, labels, cult, or, sect, to, religious, movements, in, government, documents, signifies, the, popular, and, negative, use, of, the, term, cult, in, english, and, a, functionally, similar, use, of, words, translated, as, sect, in, several, european, languages, sociologists, critical, to, this, negative, politicized, use, of, the, word, cult, argue, that, it, may, adversely, impact, the, religious, freedoms, of, group, members, at, the, height, of, the, counter, cult, movement, and, ritual, abuse, scare, of, the, 1990s, some, governments, published, lists, of, cults, while, these, documents, utilize, similar, terminology, they, do, not, necessarily, include, the, same, groups, nor, is, their, assessment, of, these, groups, based, on, agreed, criteria, other, governments, and, world, bodies, also, report, on, new, religious, movements, but, do, not, use, these, terms, to, describe, the, groups, since, the, 2000s, some, governments, have, again, distanced, themselves, from, such, classifications, of, religious, movements, while, the, official, response, to, new, religious, groups, has, been, mixed, across, the, globe, some, governments, aligned, more, with, the, critics, of, these, groups, to, the, extent, of, distinguishing, between, legitimate, religion, and, dangerous, unwanted, cults, in, public, policy, for, centuries, governments, in, china, have, categorized, certain, religions, as, xi, ji, o, sometimes, translated, as, evil, cults, or, heterodox, teachings, in, imperial, china, the, classification, of, a, religion, as, xiejiao, did, not, necessarily, mean, that, a, religion, s, teachings, were, believed, to, be, false, or, inauthentic, rather, the, label, was, applied, to, religious, groups, that, were, not, authorized, by, the, state, or, it, was, applied, to, religious, groups, that, were, believed, to, challenge, the, legitimacy, of, the, state, in, modern, china, the, term, xiejiao, continues, to, be, used, to, denote, teachings, that, the, government, disapproves, of, and, these, groups, face, suppression, and, punishment, by, authorities, fourteen, different, groups, in, china, have, been, listed, by, the, ministry, of, public, security, as, xiejiao, additionally, in, 1999, chinese, communist, party, authorities, denounced, the, falun, gong, spiritual, practice, as, a, heretical, teaching, and, they, launched, a, campaign, to, eliminate, it, however, such, claims, only, exist, in, party, resolutions, and, have, not, been, legitimized, by, china, s, own, law, systems, according, to, amnesty, international, the, persecution, of, falun, gong, includes, a, multifaceted, propaganda, campaign, a, program, of, enforced, ideological, conversion, and, re, education, as, well, as, a, variety, of, extralegal,

church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, jehovah, s, witnesses, and, other, sects, which, were, loosely, referred, to, as, neo, pentecostals, in, the, 1970s, the, scientific, status, of, the, brainwashing, theory, became, a, central, topic, in, u, s, court, cases, where, the, theory, was, used, to, try, to, justify, the, use, of, the, forceful, deprogramming, of, cult, members,

which, were, delivered, by, scholars, such, as, dick, anthony, the, governments, of, france, and, belgium, have, taken, policy, positions, which, accept, brainwashing, theories, uncritically, while, the, governments, of, other, european, nations, such, as, those, of, sweden, and, italy, are, cautious, with, regard, to, brainwashing, and, as, a, result, they, have, responded, more, neutrally, with, regard, to, new, religions, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, outrage, which, followed, the, mass, murder, suicides, which, were, perpetuated, by, the, solar, temple, have, significantly, contributed, to, european, anti, cult, positions, as, well, as, more, latent, xenophobic, and, anti, american, attitudes, which, are, widespread, on, the, continent, in, the, 1980s, clergymen, and,
