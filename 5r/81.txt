aesthetics, also, spelled, esthetics, is, the, branch, of, philosophy, concerned, with, the, nature, of, beauty, and, the, nature, of, taste, and, functions, as, the, philosophy, of, art, aesthetics, examines, the, philosophy, of, aesthetic, value, which, is, determined, by, critical, judgments, of, artistic, taste, thus, the, function, of, aesthetics, is, the, critical, reflection, on, art, culture, and, nature, aesthetics, studies, natural, and, artificial, sources, of, experiences, and, how, people, form, a, judgment, about, those, sources, of, experience, it, considers, what, happens, in, our, minds, when, we, engage, with, objects, or, environments, such, as, viewing, visual, art, listening, to, music, reading, poetry, experiencing, a, play, watching, a, fashion, show, movie, sports, or, exploring, various, aspects, of, nature, the, philosophy, of, art, specifically, studies, how, artists, imagine, create, and, perform, works, of, art, as, well, as, how, people, use, enjoy, and, criticize, art, aesthetics, considers, why, people, like, some, works, of, art, and, not, others, as, well, as, how, art, can, affect, our, moods, and, our, beliefs, both, aesthetics, and, the, philosophy, of, art, try, to, find, answers, to, what, exactly, is, art, and, what, makes, good, art, the, word, aesthetic, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, aisth, tik, s, perceptive, sensitive, pertaining, to, sensory, perception, which, in, turn, comes, from, aisth, nomai, i, perceive, sense, learn, and, is, related, to, a, sth, sis, perception, sensation, aesthetics, in, this, central, sense, has, been, said, to, start, with, the, series, of, articles, on, the, pleasures, of, the, imagination, which, the, journalist, joseph, addison, wrote, in, the, early, issues, of, the, magazine, the, spectator, in, 1712, the, term, aesthetics, was, appropriated, and, coined, with, new, meaning, by, the, german, philosopher, alexander, baumgarten, in, his, dissertation, meditationes, philosophicae, de, nonnullis, ad, poema, pertinentibus, english, philosophical, considerations, of, some, matters, pertaining, the, poem, in, 1735, baumgarten, chose, aesthetics, because, he, wished, to, emphasize, the, experience, of, art, as, a, means, of, knowing, baumgarten, s, definition, of, aesthetics, in, the, fragment, aesthetica, 1750, is, occasionally, considered, the, first, definition, of, modern, aesthetics, the, term, was, introduced, into, the, english, language, by, thomas, carlyle, in, his, life, of, friedrich, schiller, 1825, the, history, of, the, philosophy, of, art, as, aesthetics, covering, the, visual, arts, the, literary, arts, the, musical, arts, and, other, artists, forms, of, expression, can, be, dated, back, at, least, to, aristotle, and, the, ancient, greeks, aristotle, writing, of, the, literary, arts, in, his, poetics, stated, that, epic, poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic, poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and, dance, are, all, fundamentally, acts, of, mimesis, each, varying, in, imitation, by, medium, object, and, manner, aristotle, applies, the, term, mimesis, both, as, a, property, of, a, work, of, art, and, also, as, the, product, of, the, artist, s, intention, and, contends, that, the, audience, s, realisation, of, the, mimesis, is, vital, to, understanding, the, work, itself, aristotle, states, that, mimesis, is, a, natural, instinct, of, humanity, that, separates, humans, from, animals, and, that, all, human, artistry, follows, the, pattern, of, nature, because, of, this, aristotle, believed, that, each, of, the, mimetic, arts, possesses, what, stephen, halliwell, calls, highly, structured, procedures, for, the, achievement, of, their, purposes, for, example, music, imitates, with, the, media, of, rhythm, and, harmony, whereas, dance, imitates, with, rhythm, alone, and, poetry, with, language, the, forms, also, differ, in, their, object, of, imitation, comedy, for, instance, is, a, dramatic, imitation, of, men, worse, than, average, whereas, tragedy, imitates, men, slightly, better, than, average, lastly, the, forms, differ, in, their, manner, of, imitation, through, narrative, or, character, through, change, or, no, change, and, through, drama, or, no, drama, erich, auerbach, has, extended, the, discussion, of, history, of, aesthetics, in, his, book, titled, mimesis, some, distinguish, aesthetics, from, the, philosophy, of, art, claiming, that, the, former, is, the, study, of, beauty, and, taste, while, the, latter, is, the, study, of, works, of, art, but, aesthetics, typically, considers, questions, of, beauty, as, well, as, of, art, it, examines, topics, such, as, art, works, aesthetic, experience, and, aesthetic, judgment, aesthetic, experience, refers, to, the, sensory, contemplation, or, appreciation, of, an, object, not, necessarily, a, work, of, art, while, artistic, judgment, refers, to, the, recognition, appreciation, or, criticism, of, art, in, general, or, a, specific, work, of, art, in, the, words, of, one, philosopher, philosophy, of, art, is, about, art, aesthetics, is, about, many, things, including, art, but, it, is, also, about, our, experience, of, breathtaking, landscapes, or, the, pattern, of, shadows, on, the, wall, opposite, your, office, philosophers, of, art, weigh, a, culturally, contingent, conception, of, art, versus, one, that, is, purely, theoretical, they, study, the, varieties, of, art, in, relation, to, their, physical, social, and, cultural, environments, aesthetic, philosophers, sometimes, also, refer, to, psychological, studies, to, help, understand, how, people, see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and, act, in, relation, to, the, materials, and, problems, of, art, aesthetic, psychology, studies, the, creative, process, and, the, aesthetic, experience, aesthetics, is, for, the, artist, as, ornithology, is, for, the, birds, aesthetics, examines, affective, domain, response, to, an, object, or, phenomenon, judgements, of, aesthetic, value, rely, on, the, ability, to, discriminate, at, a, sensory, level, however, aesthetic, judgments, usually, go, beyond, sensory, discrimination, for, david, hume, delicacy, of, taste, is, not, merely, the, ability, to, detect, all, the, ingredients, in, a, composition, but, also, the, sensitivity, to, pains, as, well, as, pleasures, which, escape, the, rest, of, mankind, thus, sensory, discrimination, is, linked, to, capacity, for, pleasure, for, immanuel, kant, critique, of, judgment, 1790, enjoyment, is, the, result, when, pleasure, arises, from, sensation, but, judging, something, to, be, beautiful, has, a, third, requirement, sensation, must, give, rise, to, pleasure, by, engaging, reflective, contemplation, judgements, of, beauty, are, sensory, emotional, and, intellectual, all, at, once, kant, observed, of, a, man, if, he, says, that, canary, wine, is, pleasant, he, is, quite, content, if, someone, else, corrects, his, expression, and, remind, him, that, he, ought, to, say, instead, it, is, pleasant, to, me, because, every, one, has, his, own, taste, the, case, of, beauty, is, different, from, mere, pleasantness, because, if, he, gives, out, anything, as, beautiful, he, supposes, in, others, the, same, satisfaction, he, judges, not, merely, for, himself, but, for, every, one, and, speaks, of, beauty, as, if, it, were, a, property, of, things, viewer, interpretations, of, beauty, may, on, occasion, be, observed, to, possess, two, concepts, of, value, aesthetics, and, taste, aesthetics, is, the, philosophical, notion, of, beauty, taste, is, a, result, of, an, education, process, and, awareness, of, elite, cultural, values, learned, through, exposure, to, mass, culture, bourdieu, examined, how, the, elite, in, society, define, the, aesthetic, values, like, taste, and, how, varying, levels, of, exposure, to, these, values, can, result, in, variations, by, class, cultural, background, and, education, according, to, kant, beauty, is, subjective, and, universal, thus, certain, things, are, beautiful, to, everyone, in, the, opinion, of, w, adys, aw, tatarkiewicz, there, are, six, conditions, for, the, presentation, of, art, beauty, form, representation, reproduction, of, reality, artistic, expression, and, innovation, however, one, may, not, be, able, to, pin, down, these, qualities, in, a, work, of, art, the, question, of, whether, there, are, facts, about, aesthetic, judgments, belongs, to, the, branch, of, metaphilosophy, known, as, meta, aesthetics, aesthetic, judgment, is, closely, tied, to, disgust, responses, like, disgust, show, that, sensory, detection, is, linked, in, instinctual, ways, to, facial, expressions, including, physiological, responses, like, the, gag, reflex, disgust, is, triggered, largely, by, dissonance, as, darwin, pointed, out, seeing, a, stripe, of, soup, in, a, man, s, beard, is, disgusting, even, though, neither, soup, nor, beards, are, themselves, disgusting, aesthetic, judgments, may, be, linked, to, emotions, or, like, emotions, partially, embodied, in, physical, reactions, for, example, the, awe, inspired, by, a, sublime, landscape, might, physically, manifest, with, an, increased, heart, rate, or, pupil, dilation, as, seen, emotions, are, conformed, to, cultural, reactions, therefore, aesthetics, is, always, characterized, by, regional, responses, as, francis, grose, was, the, first, to, affirm, in, his, rules, for, drawing, caricaturas, with, an, essay, on, comic, painting, 1788, published, in, w, hogarth, the, analysis, of, beauty, bagster, london, s, d, 1791, pp, 1, 24, francis, grose, can, therefore, be, claimed, to, be, the, first, critical, aesthetic, regionalist, in, proclaiming, the, anti, universality, of, aesthetics, in, contrast, to, the, perilous, and, always, resurgent, dictatorship, of, beauty, aesthetic, regionalism, can, thus, be, seen, as, a, political, statement, and, stance, which, vies, against, any, universal, notion, of, beauty, to, safeguard, the, counter, tradition, of, aesthetics, related, to, what, has, been, considered, and, dubbed, un, beautiful, just, because, one, s, culture, does, not, contemplate, it, e, g, edmund, burke, s, sublime, what, is, usually, defined, as, primitive, art, or, un, harmonious, non, cathartic, art, camp, art, which, beauty, posits, and, creates, dichotomously, as, its, opposite, without, even, the, need, of, formal, statements, but, which, will, be, perceived, as, ugly, likewise, aesthetic, judgments, may, be, culturally, conditioned, to, some, extent, victorians, in, britain, often, saw, african, sculpture, as, ugly, but, just, a, few, decades, later, edwardian, audiences, saw, the, same, sculptures, as, beautiful, evaluations, of, beauty, may, well, be, linked, to, desirability, perhaps, even, to, sexual, desirability, thus, judgments, of, aesthetic, value, can, become, linked, to, judgments, of, economic, political, or, moral, value, in, a, current, context, a, lamborghini, might, be, judged, to, be, beautiful, partly, because, it, is, desirable, as, a, status, symbol, or, it, may, be, judged, to, be, repulsive, partly, because, it, signifies, over, consumption, and, offends, political, or, moral, values, the, context, of, its, presentation, also, affects, the, perception, of, artwork, artworks, presented, in, a, classical, museum, context, are, liked, more, and, rated, more, interesting, than, when, presented, in, a, sterile, laboratory, context, while, specific, results, depend, heavily, on, the, style, of, the, presented, artwork, overall, the, effect, of, context, proved, to, be, more, important, for, the, perception, of, artwork, than, the, effect, of, genuineness, whether, the, artwork, was, being, presented, as, original, or, as, a, facsimile, copy, aesthetic, judgments, can, often, be, very, fine, grained, and, internally, contradictory, likewise, aesthetic, judgments, seem, often, to, be, at, least, partly, intellectual, and, interpretative, what, a, thing, means, or, symbolizes, is, often, what, is, being, judged, modern, aestheticians, have, asserted, that, will, and, desire, were, almost, dormant, in, aesthetic, experience, yet, preference, and, choice, have, seemed, important, aesthetics, to, some, 20th, century, thinkers, the, point, is, already, made, by, hume, but, see, mary, mothersill, beauty, and, the, critic, s, judgment, in, the, blackwell, guide, to, aesthetics, 2004, thus, aesthetic, judgments, might, be, seen, to, be, based, on, the, senses, emotions, intellectual, opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious, behaviour, conscious, decision, training, instinct, sociological, institutions, or, some, complex, combination, of, these, depending, on, exactly, which, theory, is, employed, a, third, major, topic, in, the, study, of, aesthetic, judgments, is, how, they, are, unified, across, art, forms, for, instance, the, source, of, a, painting, s, beauty, has, a, different, character, to, that, of, beautiful, music, suggesting, their, aesthetics, differ, in, kind, the, distinct, inability, of, language, to, express, aesthetic, judgment, and, the, role, of, social, construction, further, cloud, this, issue, the, philosopher, denis, dutton, identified, six, universal, signatures, in, human, aesthetics, artists, such, as, thomas, hirschhorn, have, indicated, that, there, are, too, many, exceptions, to, dutton, s, categories, for, example, hirschhorn, s, installations, deliberately, eschew, technical, virtuosity, people, can, appreciate, a, renaissance, madonna, for, aesthetic, reasons, but, such, objects, often, had, and, sometimes, still, have, specific, devotional, functions, rules, of, composition, that, might, be, read, into, duchamp, s, fountain, or, john, cage, s, 4, 33, do, not, locate, the, works, in, a, recognizable, style, or, certainly, not, a, style, recognizable, at, the, time, of, the, works, realization, moreover, some, of, dutton, s, categories, seem, too, broad, a, physicist, might, entertain, hypothetical, worlds, in, his, her, imagination, in, the, course, of, formulating, a, theory, another, problem, is, that, dutton, s, categories, seek, to, universalize, traditional, european, notions, of, aesthetics, and, art, forgetting, that, as, andr, malraux, and, others, have, pointed, out, there, have, been, large, numbers, of, cultures, in, which, such, ideas, including, the, idea, art, itself, were, non, existent, aesthetic, ethics, refers, to, the, idea, that, human, conduct, and, behaviour, ought, to, be, governed, by, that, which, is, beautiful, and, attractive, john, dewey, has, pointed, out, that, the, unity, of, aesthetics, and, ethics, is, in, fact, reflected, in, our, understanding, of, behaviour, being, fair, the, word, having, a, double, meaning, of, attractive, and, morally, acceptable, more, recently, james, page, has, suggested, that, aesthetic, ethics, might, be, taken, to, form, a, philosophical, rationale, for, peace, education, beauty, is, one, of, the, main, subjects, of, aesthetics, together, with, art, and, taste, many, of, its, definitions, include, the, idea, that, an, object, is, beautiful, if, perceiving, it, is, accompanied, by, aesthetic, pleasure, among, the, examples, of, beautiful, objects, are, landscapes, sunsets, humans, and, works, of, art, beauty, is, a, positive, aesthetic, value, that, contrasts, with, ugliness, as, its, negative, counterpart, different, intuitions, commonly, associated, with, beauty, and, its, nature, are, in, conflict, with, each, other, which, poses, certain, difficulties, for, understanding, it, on, the, one, hand, beauty, is, ascribed, to, things, as, an, objective, public, feature, on, the, other, hand, it, seems, to, depend, on, the, subjective, emotional, response, of, the, observer, it, is, said, for, example, that, beauty, is, in, the, eye, of, the, beholder, it, may, be, possible, to, reconcile, these, intuitions, by, affirming, that, it, depends, both, on, the, objective, features, of, the, beautiful, thing, and, the, subjective, response, of, the, observer, one, way, to, achieve, this, is, to, hold, that, an, object, is, beautiful, if, it, has, the, power, to, bring, about, certain, aesthetic, experiences, in, the, perceiving, subject, this, is, often, combined, with, the, view, that, the, subject, needs, to, have, the, ability, to, correctly, perceive, and, judge, beauty, sometimes, referred, to, as, sense, of, taste, various, conceptions, of, how, to, define, and, understand, beauty, have, been, suggested, classical, conceptions, emphasize, the, objective, side, of, beauty, by, defining, it, in, terms, of, the, relation, between, the, beautiful, object, as, a, whole, and, its, parts, the, parts, should, stand, in, the, right, proportion, to, each, other, and, thus, compose, an, integrated, harmonious, whole, hedonist, conceptions, on, the, other, hand, focus, more, on, the, subjective, side, by, drawing, a, necessary, connection, between, pleasure, and, beauty, e, g, that, for, an, object, to, be, beautiful, is, for, it, to, cause, disinterested, pleasure, other, conceptions, include, defining, beautiful, objects, in, terms, of, their, value, of, a, loving, attitude, towards, them, or, of, their, function, during, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, a, significant, shift, to, general, aesthetic, theory, took, place, which, attempted, to, apply, aesthetic, theory, between, various, forms, of, art, including, the, literary, arts, and, the, visual, arts, to, each, other, this, resulted, in, the, rise, of, the, new, criticism, school, and, debate, concerning, the, intentional, fallacy, at, issue, was, the, question, of, whether, the, aesthetic, intentions, of, the, artist, in, creating, the, work, of, art, whatever, its, specific, form, should, be, associated, with, the, criticism, and, evaluation, of, the, final, product, of, the, work, of, art, or, if, the, work, of, art, should, be, evaluated, on, its, own, merits, independent, of, the, intentions, of, the, artist, in, 1946, william, k, wimsatt, and, monroe, beardsley, published, a, classic, and, controversial, new, critical, essay, entitled, the, intentional, fallacy, in, which, they, argued, strongly, against, the, relevance, of, an, author, s, intention, or, intended, meaning, in, the, analysis, of, a, literary, work, for, wimsatt, and, beardsley, the, words, on, the, page, were, all, that, mattered, importation, of, meanings, from, outside, the, text, was, considered, irrelevant, and, potentially, distracting, in, another, essay, the, affective, fallacy, which, served, as, a, kind, of, sister, essay, to, the, intentional, fallacy, wimsatt, and, beardsley, also, discounted, the, reader, s, personal, emotional, reaction, to, a, literary, work, as, a, valid, means, of, analyzing, a, text, this, fallacy, would, later, be, repudiated, by, theorists, from, the, reader, response, school, of, literary, theory, one, of, the, leading, theorists, from, this, school, stanley, fish, was, himself, trained, by, new, critics, fish, criticizes, wimsatt, and, beardsley, in, his, essay, literature, in, the, reader, 1970, as, summarized, by, berys, gaut, and, livingston, in, their, essay, the, creation, of, art, structuralist, and, post, structuralists, theorists, and, critics, were, sharply, critical, of, many, aspects, of, new, criticism, beginning, with, the, emphasis, on, aesthetic, appreciation, and, the, so, called, autonomy, of, art, but, they, reiterated, the, attack, on, biographical, criticisms, assumption, that, the, artist, s, activities, and, experience, were, a, privileged, critical, topic, these, authors, contend, that, anti, intentionalists, such, as, formalists, hold, that, the, intentions, involved, in, the, making, of, art, are, irrelevant, or, peripheral, to, correctly, interpreting, art, so, details, of, the, act, of, creating, a, work, though, possibly, of, interest, in, themselves, have, no, bearing, on, the, correct, interpretation, of, the, work, gaut, and, livingston, define, the, intentionalists, as, distinct, from, formalists, stating, that, intentionalists, unlike, formalists, hold, that, reference, to, intentions, is, essential, in, fixing, the, correct, interpretation, of, works, they, quote, richard, wollheim, as, stating, that, the, task, of, criticism, is, the, reconstruction, of, the, creative, process, where, the, creative, process, must, in, turn, be, thought, of, as, something, not, stopping, short, of, but, terminating, on, the, work, of, art, itself, a, large, number, of, derivative, forms, of, aesthetics, have, developed, as, contemporary, and, transitory, forms, of, inquiry, associated, with, the, field, of, aesthetics, which, include, the, post, modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and, mathematical, among, others, early, twentieth, century, artists, poets, and, composers, challenged, existing, notions, of, beauty, broadening, the, scope, of, art, and, aesthetics, in, 1941, eli, siegel, american, philosopher, and, poet, founded, aesthetic, realism, the, philosophy, that, reality, itself, is, aesthetic, and, that, the, world, art, and, self, explain, each, other, each, is, the, aesthetic, oneness, of, opposites, various, attempts, have, been, made, to, define, post, modern, aesthetics, the, challenge, to, the, assumption, that, beauty, was, central, to, art, and, aesthetics, thought, to, be, original, is, actually, continuous, with, older, aesthetic, theory, aristotle, was, the, first, in, the, western, tradition, to, classify, beauty, into, types, as, in, his, theory, of, drama, and, kant, made, a, distinction, between, beauty, and, the, sublime, what, was, new, was, a, refusal, to, credit, the, higher, status, of, certain, types, where, the, taxonomy, implied, a, preference, for, tragedy, and, the, sublime, to, comedy, and, the, rococo, croce, suggested, that, expression, is, central, in, the, way, that, beauty, was, once, thought, to, be, central, george, dickie, suggested, that, the, sociological, institutions, of, the, art, world, were, the, glue, binding, art, and, sensibility, into, unities, marshall, mcluhan, suggested, that, art, always, functions, as, a, counter, environment, designed, to, make, visible, what, is, usually, invisible, about, a, society, theodor, adorno, felt, that, aesthetics, could, not, proceed, without, confronting, the, role, of, the, culture, industry, in, the, commodification, of, art, and, aesthetic, experience, hal, foster, attempted, to, portray, the, reaction, against, beauty, and, modernist, art, in, the, anti, aesthetic, essays, on, postmodern, culture, arthur, danto, has, described, this, reaction, as, kalliphobia, after, the, greek, word, for, beauty, kallos, andr, malraux, explains, that, the, notion, of, beauty, was, connected, to, a, particular, conception, of, art, that, arose, with, the, renaissance, and, was, still, dominant, in, the, eighteenth, century, but, was, supplanted, later, the, discipline, of, aesthetics, which, originated, in, the, eighteenth, century, mistook, this, transient, state, of, affairs, for, a, revelation, of, the, permanent, nature, of, art, brian, massumi, suggests, to, reconsider, beauty, following, the, aesthetical, thought, in, the, philosophy, of, deleuze, and, guattari, walter, benjamin, echoed, malraux, in, believing, aesthetics, was, a, comparatively, recent, invention, a, view, proven, wrong, in, the, late, 1970s, when, abraham, moles, and, frieder, nake, analyzed, links, between, beauty, information, processing, and, information, theory, denis, dutton, in, the, art, instinct, also, proposed, that, an, aesthetic, sense, was, a, vital, evolutionary, factor, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, re, invokes, the, kantian, distinction, between, taste, and, the, sublime, sublime, painting, unlike, kitsch, realism, will, enable, us, to, see, only, by, making, it, impossible, to, see, it, will, please, only, by, causing, pain, sigmund, freud, inaugurated, aesthetical, thinking, in, psychoanalysis, mainly, via, the, uncanny, as, aesthetical, affect, following, freud, and, merleau, ponty, jacques, lacan, theorized, aesthetics, in, terms, of, sublimation, and, the, thing, the, relation, of, marxist, aesthetics, to, post, modern, aesthetics, is, still, a, contentious, area, of, debate, the, field, of, experimental, aesthetics, was, founded, by, gustav, theodor, fechner, in, the, 19th, century, experimental, aesthetics, in, these, times, had, been, characterized, by, a, subject, based, inductive, approach, the, analysis, of, individual, experience, and, behaviour, based, on, experimental, methods, is, a, central, part, of, experimental, aesthetics, in, particular, the, perception, of, works, of, art, music, sound, or, modern, items, such, as, websites, or, other, it, products, is, studied, experimental, aesthetics, is, strongly, oriented, towards, the, natural, sciences, modern, approaches, mostly, come, from, the, fields, of, cognitive, psychology, aesthetic, cognitivism, or, neuroscience, neuroaesthetics, mathematical, considerations, such, as, symmetry, and, complexity, are, used, for, analysis, in, theoretical, aesthetics, this, is, different, from, the, aesthetic, considerations, of, applied, aesthetics, used, in, the, study, of, mathematical, beauty, aesthetic, considerations, such, as, symmetry, and, simplicity, are, used, in, areas, of, philosophy, such, as, ethics, and, theoretical, physics, and, cosmology, to, define, truth, outside, of, empirical, considerations, beauty, and, truth, have, been, argued, to, be, nearly, synonymous, as, reflected, in, the, statement, beauty, is, truth, truth, beauty, in, the, poem, ode, on, a, grecian, urn, by, john, keats, or, by, the, hindu, motto, satyam, shivam, sundaram, satya, truth, is, shiva, god, and, shiva, is, sundaram, beautiful, the, fact, that, judgments, of, beauty, and, judgments, of, truth, both, are, influenced, by, processing, fluency, which, is, the, ease, with, which, information, can, be, processed, has, been, presented, as, an, explanation, for, why, beauty, is, sometimes, equated, with, truth, recent, research, found, that, people, use, beauty, as, an, indication, for, truth, in, mathematical, pattern, tasks, however, scientists, including, the, mathematician, david, orrell, and, physicist, marcelo, gleiser, have, argued, that, the, emphasis, on, aesthetic, criteria, such, as, symmetry, is, equally, capable, of, leading, scientists, astray, computational, approaches, to, aesthetics, emerged, amid, efforts, to, use, computer, science, methods, to, predict, convey, and, evoke, emotional, response, to, a, piece, of, art, in, this, field, aesthetics, is, not, considered, to, be, dependent, on, taste, but, is, a, matter, of, cognition, and, consequently, learning, in, 1928, the, mathematician, george, david, birkhoff, created, an, aesthetic, measure, m, o, c, displaystyle, m, o, c, as, the, ratio, of, order, to, complexity, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, max, bense, abraham, moles, and, frieder, nake, were, among, the, first, to, analyze, links, between, aesthetics, information, processing, and, information, theory, max, bense, for, example, built, on, birkhoff, s, aesthetic, measure, and, proposed, a, similar, information, theoretic, measure, m, a, r, h, displaystyle, m, ddot, a, r, h, where, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, redundancy, and, h, displaystyle, h, the, entropy, which, assigns, higher, value, to, simpler, artworks, in, the, 1990s, j, rgen, schmidhuber, described, an, algorithmic, theory, of, beauty, this, theory, takes, the, subjectivity, of, the, observer, into, account, and, postulates, that, among, several, observations, classified, as, comparable, by, a, given, subjective, observer, the, most, aesthetically, pleasing, is, the, one, that, is, encoded, by, the, shortest, description, following, the, direction, of, previous, approaches, schmidhuber, s, theory, explicitly, distinguishes, between, that, which, is, beautiful, and, that, which, is, interesting, stating, that, interestingness, corresponds, to, the, first, derivative, of, subjectively, perceived, beauty, he, supposes, that, every, observer, continually, tries, to, improve, the, predictability, and, compressibility, of, their, observations, by, identifying, regularities, like, repetition, symmetry, and, fractal, self, similarity, since, about, 2005, computer, scientists, have, attempted, to, develop, automated, methods, to, infer, aesthetic, quality, of, images, typically, these, approaches, follow, a, machine, learning, approach, where, large, numbers, of, manually, rated, photographs, are, used, to, teach, a, computer, about, what, visual, properties, are, of, relevance, to, aesthetic, quality, a, study, by, y, li, and, c, j, hu, employed, birkhoff, s, measurement, in, their, statistical, learning, approach, where, order, and, complexity, of, an, image, determined, aesthetic, value, the, image, complexity, was, computed, using, information, theory, while, the, order, was, determined, using, fractal, compression, there, is, also, the, case, of, the, acquine, engine, developed, at, penn, state, university, that, rates, natural, photographs, uploaded, by, users, there, have, also, been, relatively, successful, attempts, with, regard, to, chess, and, music, computational, approaches, have, also, been, attempted, in, film, making, as, demonstrated, by, a, software, model, developed, by, chitra, dorai, and, a, group, of, researchers, at, the, ibm, t, j, watson, research, center, the, tool, predicted, aesthetics, based, on, the, values, of, narrative, elements, a, relation, between, max, bense, s, mathematical, formulation, of, aesthetics, in, terms, of, redundancy, and, complexity, and, theories, of, musical, anticipation, was, offered, using, the, notion, of, information, rate, evolutionary, aesthetics, refers, to, evolutionary, psychology, theories, in, which, the, basic, aesthetic, preferences, of, homo, sapiens, are, argued, to, have, evolved, in, order, to, enhance, survival, and, reproductive, success, one, example, being, that, humans, are, argued, to, find, beautiful, and, prefer, landscapes, which, were, good, habitats, in, the, ancestral, environment, another, example, is, that, body, symmetry, and, proportion, are, important, aspects, of, physical, attractiveness, which, may, be, due, to, this, indicating, good, health, during, body, growth, evolutionary, explanations, for, aesthetical, preferences, are, important, parts, of, evolutionary, musicology, darwinian, literary, studies, and, the, study, of, the, evolution, of, emotion, as, well, as, being, applied, to, art, aesthetics, can, also, be, applied, to, cultural, objects, such, as, crosses, or, tools, for, example, aesthetic, coupling, between, art, objects, and, medical, topics, was, made, by, speakers, working, for, the, us, information, agency, art, slides, were, linked, to, slides, of, pharmacological, data, which, improved, attention, and, retention, by, simultaneous, activation, of, intuitive, right, brain, with, rational, left, it, can, also, be, used, in, topics, as, diverse, as, cartography, mathematics, gastronomy, fashion, and, website, design, guy, sircello, has, pioneered, efforts, in, analytic, philosophy, to, develop, a, rigorous, theory, of, aesthetics, focusing, on, the, concepts, of, beauty, love, and, sublimity, in, contrast, to, romantic, theorists, sircello, argued, for, the, objectivity, of, beauty, and, formulated, a, theory, of, love, on, that, basis, british, philosopher, and, theorist, of, conceptual, art, aesthetics, peter, osborne, makes, the, point, that, post, conceptual, art, aesthetic, does, not, concern, a, particular, type, of, contemporary, art, so, much, as, the, historical, ontological, condition, for, the, production, of, contemporary, art, in, general, osborne, noted, that, contemporary, art, is, post, conceptual, in, a, public, lecture, delivered, in, 2010, gary, tedman, has, put, forward, a, theory, of, a, subjectless, aesthetics, derived, from, karl, marx, s, concept, of, alienation, and, louis, althusser, s, antihumanism, using, elements, of, freud, s, group, psychology, defining, a, concept, of, the, aesthetic, level, of, practice, gregory, loewen, has, suggested, that, the, subject, is, key, in, the, interaction, with, the, aesthetic, object, the, work, of, art, serves, as, a, vehicle, for, the, projection, of, the, individual, s, identity, into, the, world, of, objects, as, well, as, being, the, irruptive, source, of, much, of, what, is, uncanny, in, modern, life, as, well, art, is, used, to, memorialize, individuated, biographies, in, a, manner, that, allows, persons, to, imagine, that, they, are, part, of, something, greater, than, themselves, the, philosophy, of, aesthetics, as, a, practice, has, been, criticized, by, some, sociologists, and, writers, of, art, and, society, raymond, williams, for, example, argues, that, there, is, no, unique, and, or, individual, aesthetic, object, which, can, be, extrapolated, from, the, art, world, but, rather, that, there, is, a, continuum, of, cultural, forms, and, experience, of, which, ordinary, speech, and, experiences, may, signal, as, art, by, art, we, may, frame, several, artistic, works, or, creations, as, so, though, this, reference, remains, within, the, institution, or, special, event, which, creates, it, and, this, leaves, some, works, or, other, possible, art, outside, of, the, frame, work, or, other, interpretations, such, as, other, phenomenon, which, may, not, be, considered, as, art, pierre, bourdieu, disagrees, with, kant, s, idea, of, the, aesthetic, he, argues, that, kant, s, aesthetic, merely, represents, an, experience, that, is, the, product, of, an, elevated, class, habitus, and, scholarly, leisure, as, opposed, to, other, possible, and, equally, valid, aesthetic, experiences, which, lay, outside, kant, s, narrow, definition, timothy, laurie, argues, that, theories, of, musical, aesthetics, framed, entirely, in, terms, of, appreciation, contemplation, or, reflection, risk, idealizing, an, implausibly, unmotivated, listener, defined, solely, through, musical, objects, rather, than, seeing, them, as, a, person, for, whom, complex, intentions, and, motivations, produce, variable, attractions, to, cultural, objects, and, practices
