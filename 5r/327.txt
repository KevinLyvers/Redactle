chinese, mythology, encompasses, a, diverse, array, of, myths, derived, from, regional, and, cultural, traditions, populated, with, engaging, narratives, featuring, extraordinary, individuals, and, beings, endowed, with, magical, powers, these, stories, often, unfold, in, fantastical, mythological, realms, or, historical, epochs, similar, to, numerous, other, mythologies, chinese, mythology, has, historically, been, regarded, at, least, partially, as, a, factual, record, of, the, past, along, with, chinese, folklore, chinese, mythology, forms, an, important, part, of, chinese, folk, religion, and, taoism, especially, older, popular, forms, of, it, many, narratives, recounting, characters, and, events, from, ancient, times, exhibit, a, dual, tradition, one, that, presents, a, more, historicized, or, euhemerized, interpretation, and, another, that, offers, a, more, mythological, perspective, numerous, myths, delve, into, the, creation, and, cosmology, of, the, universe, exploring, the, origins, of, deities, and, heavenly, inhabitants, some, narratives, specifically, address, the, topic, of, creation, unraveling, the, beginnings, of, things, people, and, culture, additionally, certain, myths, are, dedicated, to, the, genesis, of, the, chinese, state, a, subset, myths, provides, a, chronology, of, prehistoric, times, often, featuring, a, culture, hero, who, taught, people, essential, skills, ranging, from, building, houses, and, cooking, to, the, basics, of, writing, in, some, cases, they, were, revered, as, the, ancestor, of, an, ethnic, group, or, dynastic, families, chinese, mythology, is, intimately, connected, to, the, traditional, chinese, concepts, of, li, and, qi, these, two, foundational, concepts, are, deeply, entwined, with, socially, oriented, ritual, acts, including, communication, greetings, dances, ceremonies, and, sacrifices, according, to, baidu, baike, s, entry, on, chinese, mythology, chinese, mythology, and, legends, could, be, generally, classified, into, four, categories, ancient, mythology, religious, mythology, folk, mythology, and, literary, mythology, significant, interplay, exists, between, chinese, mythology, and, the, philosophical, traditions, of, confucianism, taoism, and, buddhism, elements, of, pre, han, dynasty, mythology, such, as, those, in, classic, of, mountains, and, seas, were, adapted, into, these, belief, systems, as, they, developed, in, the, case, of, taoism, or, were, assimilated, into, chinese, culture, in, the, case, of, buddhism, conversely, teachings, and, beliefs, from, confucianism, taoism, and, buddhism, have, in, turn, become, integral, components, of, chinese, mythology, for, example, the, taoist, belief, of, a, spiritual, paradise, became, incorporated, into, mythology, as, the, place, where, immortals, and, deities, dwell, sometimes, mythological, and, religious, ideas, have, become, widespread, across, china, s, many, regions, and, diverse, ethnic, societies, in, other, cases, beliefs, are, more, limited, to, certain, social, groups, for, example, the, veneration, of, white, stones, by, the, qiang, one, mythological, theme, that, has, a, long, history, and, many, variations, involves, a, shamanic, world, view, for, example, in, the, cases, of, mongolian, shamanism, among, the, mongols, hmong, shamanism, among, the, miao, people, and, the, shamanic, beliefs, of, the, qing, dynasty, from, 1643, to, 1912, derived, from, the, manchus, politically, mythology, was, often, used, to, legitimize, the, dynasties, of, china, with, the, founding, house, of, a, dynasty, claiming, a, divine, descent, elaborations, on, the, wuxing, are, not, really, part, of, mythology, although, belief, in, five, elements, could, appear, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, is, a, phrase, suggesting, the, diversity, of, philosophical, thought, that, developed, during, the, warring, states, of, china, then, and, subsequently, philosophical, movements, had, a, complicated, relationship, with, mythology, however, as, far, as, they, influence, or, are, influenced, by, mythology, divides, the, philosophical, camps, into, two, rough, halves, a, liberal, group, and, a, conservative, group, the, liberal, group, being, associated, with, the, idea, of, individuality, and, change, for, example, as, seen, in, the, mythology, of, divination, in, china, such, as, the, mythology, of, the, dragon, horse, that, delivered, the, eight, bagua, diagrams, to, fu, xi, and, methods, of, individual, empowerment, as, seen, in, the, yi, jing, book, of, changes, the, liberal, tendency, is, towards, individual, freedom, daoism, and, nature, the, relationship, of, the, conservative, philosophies, to, mythology, is, seen, in, the, legendary, nine, tripod, cauldrons, mythology, about, the, emperors, and, central, bureaucratic, governance, confucianism, written, histories, ceremonial, observances, subordination, of, the, individual, to, the, social, groups, of, family, and, state, and, a, fixation, on, stability, and, enduring, institutions, the, distinction, between, the, liberal, and, conservative, is, very, general, but, important, in, chinese, thought, contradictions, can, be, found, in, the, details, however, these, are, often, traditional, such, as, the, embrace, by, confucius, of, the, philosophical, aspects, of, the, yi, jing, and, the, back, and, forth, about, the, mandate, of, heaven, wherein, one, dynasty, ends, and, another, begins, based, according, to, accounts, some, of, heavily, mythological, where, the, way, of, heaven, results, in, change, but, then, a, new, ethical, stable, dynasty, becomes, established, examples, of, this, include, the, stories, of, yi, yin, tang, of, shang, and, jie, of, xia, or, the, similar, fantastic, stories, around, duke, of, zhou, and, king, zhou, of, shang, mythology, exists, in, relationship, with, other, aspects, of, society, and, culture, such, as, ritual, various, rituals, are, explained, by, mythology, for, example, the, ritual, burning, of, mortuary, banknotes, hell, money, lighting, fireworks, and, so, on, a, good, example, of, the, relationship, between, chinese, mythology, and,

historical, literature, tends, to, begin, with, the, qin, dynasty, for, example, see, paladin, 1998, on, the, other, hand, accounts, of, the, shang, xia, and, early, zhou, dynasties, tend, to, mythologize, by, a, historical, process, of, euhemerism, many, of, these, myths, evolved, over, time, into, variant, versions, with, an, emphasis, on, moral, parables, and, rationalization, of, some,

historical, past, the, exact, line, up, of, animals, is, sometimes, slightly, different, but, the, basic, principle, is, that, each, animal, takes, a, turn, as, the, emblematic, or, totem, animal, for, a, year, or, other, unit, of, time, in, a, cycle, of, one, dozen, this, is, explained, by, various, myths, the, zodiacs, in, order, are, rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and, pig, some, chinese, mythology, becomes, specific, about, chronological, time, based, on, the, ganzhi, system, numbers, of, human, generations, or, other, details, suggesting, synchronization, between, the, mythological, chronology, and, the, ideas, of, modern, historians, however, real, correlation, begins, in, the, year, of, the, metal, monkey, zhou, dynasty, 841, bce, a, since, validated, claim, by, sima, qian, however, although, historians, take, note, of, this, subsequent, mythology, has, not, tended, to, reflect, this, quest, for, rational, historical, timelining, various, ideas, about, the, creation, of, the, universe, the, earth, the, sky, various, deities, and, creatures, and, the, origin, of, various, clans, or, ethnic, groups, of, humans, have, circulated, in, the, area, of, china, for, millennia, these, creation, myths, may, include, the, origins, of, the, universe, and, everything, the, origins, of, humans, or, the, origins, of, specific, groups, such, as, a, han, chinese, in, descent, from, yandi, and, huangdi, as, descendants, of, the, flame, and, yellow, emperors, various, myths, contain, explanations, of, various, origins, and, the, progress, of, cultural, development, one, common, story, involves, pangu, among, other, sources, he, was, written, about, by, taoist, author, xu, zheng, c, 200, ce, as, claimed, to, be, the, first, sentient, being, and, creator, making, the, heavens, and, the, earth, various, culture, heroes, have, been, said, to, have, helped, or, saved, humanity, in, many, ways, such, as, stopping, floods, teaching, the, use, of, fire, and, so, on, as, mythic, chronology, is, inherently, nonlinear, with, time, being, telescopically, expanded, or, contracted, there, are, various, contradictions, the, earliest, culture, heroes, were, sometimes, considered, deities, and, other, times, heroic, humans, but, often, little, distinction, was, made, examples, of, early, culture, heroes, include, youchao, have, nest, who, taught, people, how, to, make, wooden, shelters, and, suiren, fire, maker, who, taught, people, the, use, of, fire, and, cooking, thus, saving, them, from, much, food, poisoning, in, addition, to, developing, cuisine, another, example, of, a, mythological, hero, who, provided, beneficial, knowledge, to, humanity, involves, sericulture, the, production, of, silk, an, invention, credited, to, leizu, for, one, an, example, of, a, non, han, ethnicity, culture, hero, is, panhu, because, of, their, self, identification, as, descendants, from, these, original, ancestors, panhu, has, been, worshiped, by, the, yao, people, and, the, she, people, often, as, king, pan, and, the, eating, of, dog, meat, was, tabooed, this, ancestral, myth, has, also, been, found, among, the, miao, people, and, li, people, some, of, the, first, culture, heroes, are, the, legendary, emperors, who, succeeded, the, times, of, the, part, human, part, serpent, deities, nuwa, and, fuxi, these, emperors, tend, to, be, portrayed, as, more, explicitly, human, although, huangdi, the, yellow, emperor, is, often, portrayed, as, part, dragon, during, life, some, historicized, versions, of, semi, historical, and, undeniably, mythologized, accounts, of, ancient, times, were, used, by, those, who, have, attempted, to, apply, actual, bce, dates, to, the, mythological, chronology, traditional, chinese, accounts, of, the, early, emperors, chronologically, locate, the, yellow, emperor, as, having, lived, in, the, northern, chinese, plain, around, 2698, to, 2599, bce, about, seventeen, generations, after, the, time, of, shennong, a, major, difference, between, the, possible, historicity, of, material, embedded, in, mythological, accounts, is, that, through, the, time, of, the, last, flame, emperor, yandi, information, was, recorded, using, knotted, ropes, whereas, the, introduction, of, writing, is, associated, with, the, reign, of, huang, di, although, the, historical, continuity, of, written, tradition, beginning, at, that, time, is, a, matter, of, discussion, by, experts, the, most, prominent, of, the, first, emperors, include, in, chronological, order, huangdi, gaoyang, zhuanxu, gaoxin, di, ku, yao, and, shun, these, emperors, were, said, to, be, morally, upright, and, benevolent, and, examples, to, be, emulated, by, latter, day, kings, and, emperors, sometimes, approximate, calculations, of, times, have, been, made, based, on, the, claimed, number, of, generations, from, one, significant, mythological, figure, to, the, next, as, in, the, case, of, the, legendary, founder, of, the, ji, family, hou, ji, whose, descendants, would, rule, generations, after, his, mythological, appearance, as, the, historical, zhou, dynasty, beginning, around, 1046, bce, despite, various, assignments, of, dates, to, the, accounts, of, these, emperors, fantastic, claims, about, the, length, of, their, reigns, are, common, the, average, reign, lengths, that, these, numbers, imply, are, improbable, and, there, is, a, lack, of, consensus, regarding, these, dates, by, modern, historians, their, historical, use, may, be, limited, to, establishing, a, relative, chronology, houji, was, a, cultural, hero, of, the, agricultural, type, chiyou, also, known, as, ch, ih, yu, was, a, metallurgical, engineer, specializing, in, weaponry, the, mythological, history, of, people, or, at, least, the, han, chinese, people, begins, with, two, groups, one, of, three, and, one, of, five, the, numbers, are, symbolically, significant, however, the, actual, membership, of, the, two, groups, is, not, explicated, there, are, different, lists, the, older, group, is, the, three, primeval, emperors, who, were, followed, by, the, five, premier, emperors, after, that, came, the, three, dynasties, these, were, the, xia, dynasty, shang, dynasty, and, the, zhou, dynasty, these, three, are, all, historically, attested, to, but, separating, the, myth, from, the, history, is, not, always, clear, nevertheless, there, is, a, lot, of, mythology, around, the, three, primeval, emperors, five, premier, emperors, and, three, dynasties, an, age, of, three, primeval, emperors, followed, by, the, age, of, the, five, premier, emperors, s, nhu, ng, w, d, contrasts, with, the, subsequent, treatment, of, chronology, by, dynasties, up, to, recent, times, since, the, time, the, qin, emperor, titled, himself, huangdi, by, combining, two, previous, titles, into, one, huangdi, was, the, title, for, chinese, emperors, for, ages, the, title, of, the,

mythological, nature, one, of, the, main, legacies, of, the, rise, of, zhou, was, the, dissemination, of, the, classic, book, i, ching, however, the, eight, trigrams, must, be, from, a, far, earlier, period, than, wengong, and, even, more, than, the, editing, and, commentary, by, confucius, mythology, references, the, culture, hero, sometimes, named, fuxi, dynasties, succeeding, zhou, had,

religion, some, are, clearly, divine, such, as, the, jade, emperor, and, even, he, is, sometimes, said, to, have, begun, life, as, a, mortal, however, in, chinese, language, many, beings, are, referred, to, as, shen, sometimes, chinese, mythology, is, called, mandarin, chinese, zh, nggu, sh, nhu, due, to, the, ambiguity, of, this, word, when, translated, into, english, it, is, not, always,

type, immortals, are, defined, by, living, for, a, long, time, maybe, forever, however, this, is, not, a, static, quality, since, daoist, adepts, shamans, or, others, are, said, to, become, immortals, through, right, effort, and, various, practices, another, example, is, the, immortality, sometimes, obtained, by, the, lohans, bodhisattvas, and, buddhas, of, buddhist, religion, and, mythology, this, contrasts, with, indefinitely, prolonged, series, of, unenlightened, re, births, chinese, mythology, often, tends, to, not, make, a, clear, differentiation, between, buddhist, and, daoist, types, various, deities, spirits, and, immortals, xian, are, encountered, in, various, myths, some, of, these, are, particularly, associated, with, daoism, some, immortals, or, others, became, incorporated, into, daoism, as, it, developed, as, a, phenomenon, deriving, from, ancient, shamanic, cults, or, other, sources, the, line, between, daoism, and, folk, religion, is, not, clear, other, mythological,
