the, huangdi, neijing, the, chinese, historian, sima, qian, and, much, chinese, historiography, following, him, considered, the, yellow, emperor, to, be, a, more, historical, figure, than, earlier, legendary, figures, such, as, fu, xi, n, wa, and, shennong, sima, qian, s, records, of, the, grand, historian, begins, with, the, yellow, emperor, while, passing, over, the, others, throughout, most, of, chinese, history, the, yellow, emperor, and, the, other, ancient, sages, were, considered, to, be, historical, figures, their, historicity, started, to, be, questioned, in, the, 1920s, by, historians, such, as, gu, jiegang, one, of, the, founders, of, the, doubting, antiquity, school, in, china, in, their, attempts, to, prove, that, the, earliest, figures, of, chinese, history, were, mythological, gu, and, his, followers, argued, that, these, ancient, sages, were, originally, gods, who, were, later, depicted, as, humans, by, the, rationalist, intellectuals, of, the, warring, states, period, yang, kuan, a, member, of, the, same, current, of, historiography, noted, that, only, in, the, warring, states, period, had, the, yellow, emperor, started, to, be, described, as, the, first, ruler, of, china, yang, thus, argued, that, huangdi, was, a, later, transformation, of, shangdi, the, supreme, god, of, the, shang, dynasty, s, pantheon, also, in, the, 1920s, french, scholars, henri, maspero, and, marcel, granet, published, critical, studies, of, china, s, accounts, of, high, antiquity, in, his, danses, et, l, gendes, de, la, chine, ancienne, for, example, granet, argued, that, these, tales, were, historicized, legends, that, said, more, about, the, time, when, they, were, written, than, about, the, time, they, purported, to, describe, in, the, middle, of, the, century, a, group, of, chinese, historians, proposed, the, theory, that, were, originally, chinese, gods, who, became, thought, of, as, human, during, the, later, period, of, the, zhou, dynasty, most, scholars, now, agree, that, the, yellow, emperor, originated, as, a, god, who, was, later, represented, as, a, historical, person, k, c, chang, sees, huangdi, and, other, cultural, heroes, as, ancient, religious, figures, who, were, euhemerized, in, the, late, warring, states, and, han, periods, historian, of, ancient, china, mark, edward, lewis, speaks, of, the, yellow, emperor, s, earlier, nature, as, a, god, whereas, roel, sterckx, a, professor, at, university, of, cambridge, calls, huangdi, a, legendary, cultural, hero, the, origin, of, huangdi, s, mythology, is, unclear, but, historians, have, formulated, several, hypotheses, about, it, yang, kuan, a, member, of, the, doubting, antiquity, school, 1920s, 40s, argued, that, the, yellow, emperor, was, derived, from, shangdi, the, highest, god, of, the, shang, dynasty, yang, reconstructs, the, etymology, as, follows, shangdi, huang, shangdi, huangdi, huangdi, in, which, he, claims, that, huang, yellow, either, was, a, variant, chinese, character, for, huang, august, or, was, used, as, a, way, to, avoid, the, naming, taboo, for, the, latter, yang, s, view, has, been, criticized, by, mitarai, masaru, and, by, michael, puett, historian, mark, edward, lewis, agrees, that, huang, and, huang, were, often, interchangeable, but, disagreeing, with, yang, he, claims, that, huang, meaning, yellow, appeared, first, based, on, what, he, admits, is, a, novel, etymology, likening, huang, to, the, phonetically, close, wang, the, burned, shaman, in, shang, rainmaking, rituals, lewis, suggests, that, huang, in, huangdi, might, originally, have, meant, rainmaking, shaman, or, rainmaking, ritual, citing, late, warring, states, and, early, han, versions, of, huangdi, s, myth, he, further, argues, that, the, figure, of, the, yellow, emperor, originated, in, ancient, rain, making, rituals, in, which, huangdi, represented, the, power, of, rain, and, clouds, whereas, his, mythical, rival, chiyou, or, the, yan, emperor, stood, for, fire, and, drought, also, disagreeing, with, yang, kuan, s, hypothesis, sarah, allan, finds, it, unlikely, that, such, a, popular, myth, as, the, yellow, emperor, s, could, have, come, from, a, taboo, character, she, argues, instead, that, pre, shang, history, including, the, story, of, the, yellow, emperor, can, all, be, understood, as, a, later, transformation, and, systematization, of, shang, mythology, in, her, view, huangdi, was, originally, an, unnamed, lord, of, the, underworld, or, the, yellow, springs, the, mythological, counterpart, of, the, shang, sky, deity, shangdi, at, the, time, shang, rulers, claimed, that, their, mythical, ancestors, identified, with, the, suns, birds, east, life, the, lord, on, high, i, e, shangdi, had, defeated, an, earlier, people, associated, with, the, underworld, dragons, west, after, the, zhou, dynasty, overthrew, the, shang, dynasty, in, the, eleventh, century, bc, zhou, leaders, reinterpreted, shang, myths, as, meaning, that, the, shang, had, vanquished, a, real, political, dynasty, which, was, eventually, named, the, xia, dynasty, by, han, times, as, seen, in, sima, qian, s, account, in, the, shiji, the, yellow, emperor, who, as, lord, of, the, underworld, had, been, symbolically, linked, to, the, xia, had, become, a, historical, ruler, whose, descendants, were, thought, to, have, founded, the, xia,

the, state, of, qi, lothar, von, falkenhausen, speculates, that, huangdi, was, invented, as, an, ancestral, figure, as, part, of, a, strategy, to, claim, that, all, ruling, clans, in, the, zhou, dynasty, culture, sphere, shared, common, ancestry, explicit, accounts, of, the, yellow, emperor, started, to, appear, in, chinese, texts, during, the, warring, states, period, the, earliest, extant, mention, of, huangdi, is, an, inscription, on, the, chen, hou, yinqi, dui, cast, during, the, first, half, of, the, fourth, century, bc, by, the, royal, family, surnamed, tian, of, the, state, of, qi, a, powerful, eastern, state, as, the, tian, family, had, usurped, the, throne, of, qi, establishing, such, a, divine, heritage, would, positively, affect, their, claim, to, legitimacy, harvard, university, historian, michael, puett, writes, that, the, qi, bronze, inscription, was, one, of, several, references, to, the, yellow, emperor, in, the, fourth, and, third, centuries, bc, within, accounts, of, the, creation, of, the, state, noting, that, many, of, the, thinkers, who, were, later, identified, as, precursors, of, the, huang, lao, huangdi, and, laozi, tradition, came, from, the, state, of, qi, robin, d, s, yates, hypothesizes, that, huang, lao, originated, in, that, region, the, cult, of, huangdi, became, very, popular, during, the, warring, states, period, 5th, century, 221,

of, the, chinese, calendar, intellectuals, such, as, liu, shipei, 1884, 1919, found, this, practice, necessary, in, order, to, preserve, the, race, baozhong, from, both, dominance, by, manchu, people, and, foreign, encroachment, revolutionaries, motivated, by, anti, manchuism, such, as, chen, tianhua, 1875, 1905, zou, rong, 1885, 1905, and, zhang, binglin, 1868, 1936, tried, to, foster, the,

also, served, to, buttress, the, theory, that, he, was, the, originator, of, the, yellow, race, many, historians, interpret, this, sudden, popularity, of, the, yellow, emperor, as, a, reaction, to, the, theories, of, french, scholar, albert, terrien, de, lacouperie, 1845, 94, who, in, a, book, called, the, western, origin, of, the, early, chinese, civilization, from, 2300, b, c, to, 200, a, d, 1892, had, claimed, that, chinese, civilization, was, founded, around, 2300, bce, by, babylonian, immigrants, lacouperie, s, sino, babylonianism, posited, that, huangdi, was, a, mesopotamian, tribal, leader, who, had, led, a, massive, migration, of, his, people, into, china, around, 2300, bc, and, founded, what, later, became, chinese, civilization, european, sinologists, quickly, rejected, these, theories, but, in, 1900, two, japanese, historians, shirakawa, jir, and, kokubu, tanenori, omitted, these, criticisms, and, published, a, long, summary, that, presented, lacouperie, s, views, as, the, most, advanced, western, scholarship, on, china, chinese, scholars, were, quickly, attracted, by, the, historicization, of, chinese, mythology, that, the, two, japanese, authors, advocated, anti, manchu, intellectuals, and, activists, who, searched, for, china, s, national, essence, guocui, adapted, sino, babylonianism, to, their, needs, zhang, binglin, explained, huangdi, s, battle, with, chi, you, as, a, conflict, opposing, the, newly, arrived, civilized, mesopotamians, to, backward, local, tribes, a, battle, that, transformed, china, into, one, of, the, most, civilized, places, in,

golden, age, of, chinese, civilization, in, addition, to, tying, the, chinese, to, an, ancient, center, of, human, civilization, in, mesopotamia, lacouperie, s, theories, suggested, that, china, should, be, ruled, by, the, descendants, of, huangdi, in, a, controversial, essay, called, history, of, the, yellow, race, huangshi, which, was, published, serially, from, 1905, to, 1908, huang, jie, 1873, 1935, claimed, that, the, han, race, was, the, true, master, of, china, because, it, was, descended, from, the, yellow, emperor, reinforced, by, the, values, of, filial, piety, and, the, chinese, patrilineal, clan, the, racial, vision, defended, by, huang, and, others, turned, vengeance, against, the, manchus, into, a, duty, owed, to, one, s, ancestors, the, yellow, emperor, continued, to, be, revered, after, the, 1911, revolution, which, overthrew, the, qing, dynasty, in, 1912, for, instance, banknotes, carrying, huangdi, s, effigy, were, issued, by, the, new, republican, government, after, 1911, however, the, yellow, emperor, as, national, symbol, changed, from, first, progenitor, of, the, han, race, to, ancestor, of, china, s, entire, multi, ethnic, population, under, the, ideology, of, the, five, races, under, one, union, huangdi, became, the, common, ancestor, of, the, han, chinese, the, manchu, people, the, mongols, the, tibetans, and, the, hui, people, who, were, said, to, form, the, zhonghua, minzu, a, broadly, understood, chinese, nation, sixteen, state, ceremonies, were, held, between, 1911, and, 1949, to, huangdi, as, the, founding, ancestor, of, the, chinese, nation, and, even, the, founding, ancestor, of, human, civilization, the, cult, of, the, yellow, emperor, was, forbidden, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, until, the, end, of, the, cultural, revolution, the, prohibition, was, halted, during, the, 1980s, when, the, government, reversed, itself, and, resurrected, the, yellow, emperor, cult, starting, in, the, 1980s, the, cult, was, revived, and, phrases, relating, to, the, descendants, of, yan, and, huang, were, sometimes, used, by, the, chinese, state, when, referring, to, people, of, chinese, descent, in, 1984, for, example, deng, xiaoping, argued, for, chinese, unification, saying, taiwan, is, rooted, in, the, hearts, of, the, descendants, of, the, yellow, emperor, whereas, in, 1986, the, prc, acclaimed, the, chinese, american, astronaut, taylor, wang, as, the, first, of, the, yellow, emperor, s, descendants, to, travel, in, space, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1980s, the, party, had,

teaches, at, the, national, university, of, singapore, and, specializes, in, the, chinese, calendar, explains, that, those, who, use, 2698, bc, as, a, first, year, probably, do, so, because, they, want, to, have, a, year, 0, as, the, starting, point, or, because, they, assume, that, the, yellow, emperor, started, his, year, with, the, winter, solstice, of, 2698, bc, hence, the, difference,
