https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve
adam, and, eve, according, to, the, creation, myth, of, the, abrahamic, religions, were, the, first, man, and, woman, they, are, central, to, the, belief, that, humanity, is, in, essence, a, single, family, with, everyone, descended, from, a, single, pair, of, original, ancestors, they, also, provide, the, basis, for, the, doctrines, of, the, fall, of, man, and, original, sin, which, are, important, beliefs, in, christianity, although, not, held, in, judaism, or, islam, in, the, book, of, genesis, of, the, hebrew, bible, chapters, one, through, five, there, are, two, creation, narratives, with, two, distinct, perspectives, in, the, first, adam, and, eve, are, not, named, instead, god, created, humankind, in, god, s, image, and, instructed, them, to, multiply, and, to, be, stewards, over, everything, else, that, god, had, made, in, the, second, narrative, god, fashions, adam, from, dust, and, places, him, in, the, garden, of, eden, adam, is, told, that, he, can, eat, freely, of, all, the, trees, in, the, garden, except, for, a, tree, of, the, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, subsequently, eve, is, created, from, one, of, adam, s, ribs, to, be, his, companion, they, are, innocent, and, unembarrassed, about, their, nakedness, however, a, serpent, convinces, eve, to, eat, fruit, from, the, forbidden, tree, and, she, gives, some, of, the, fruit, to, adam, these, acts, not, only, give, them, additional, knowledge, but, also, give, them, the, ability, to, conjure, negative, and, destructive, concepts, such, as, shame, and, evil, god, later, curses, the, serpent, and, the, ground, god, prophetically, tells, the, woman, and, the, man, what, will, be, the, consequences, of, their, sin, of, disobeying, god, then, he, banishes, them, from, the, garden, of, eden, neither, adam, nor, eve, is, mentioned, elsewhere, in, the, hebrew, scriptures, apart, from, a, single, listing, of, adam, in, a, genealogy, in, 1, chronicles, 1, 1, suggesting, that, although, their, story, came, to, be, prefixed, to, the, jewish, story, it, has, little, in, common, with, it, the, myth, underwent, extensive, elaboration, in, later, abrahamic, traditions, and, it, has, been, extensively, analyzed, by, modern, biblical, scholars, interpretations, and, beliefs, regarding, adam, and, eve, and, the, story, revolving, around, them, vary, across, religions, and, sects, for, example, the, islamic, version, of, the, story, holds, that, adam, and, eve, were, equally, responsible, for, their, sins, of, hubris, instead, of, eve, being, the, first, one, to, be, unfaithful, the, story, of, adam, and, eve, is, often, depicted, in, art, and, it, has, had, an, important, influence, in, literature, and, poetry, the, opening, chapters, of, the, book, of, genesis, provide, a, mythic, history, of, the, infiltration, of, evil, into, the, world, god, places, the, first, man, and, woman, adam, and, eve, in, his, garden, of, eden, whence, they, are, expelled, the, first, murder, follows, and, god, s, decision, to, destroy, the, world, and, save, only, the, righteous, noah, and, his, sons, a, new, humanity, then, descends, from, these, and, spreads, throughout, the, world, but, although, the, new, world, is, as, sinful, as, the, old, god, has, resolved, never, again, to, destroy, the, world, by, flood, and, the, history, ends, with, terah, the, father, of, abraham, from, whom, will, descend, god, s, chosen, people, the, israelites, adam, and, eve, are, the, bible, s, first, man, and, first, woman, adam, s, name, appears, first, in, genesis, 1, with, a, collective, sense, as, mankind, subsequently, in, genesis, 2, 3, it, carries, the, definite, article, ha, equivalent, to, english, the, indicating, that, this, is, the, man, in, these, chapters, god, fashions, the, man, ha, adam, from, earth, adamah, breathes, life, into, his, nostrils, and, makes, him, a, caretaker, over, creation, god, next, creates, for, the, man, an, ezer, kenegdo, a, helper, corresponding, to, him, from, his, side, or, rib, the, word, rib, is, a, pun, in, sumerian, as, the, word, ti, means, both, rib, and, life, she, is, called, ishsha, woman, because, the, text, says, she, is, formed, from, ish, man, the, man, receives, her, with, joy, and, the, reader, is, told, that, from, this, moment, a, man, will, leave, his, parents, to, cling, to, a, woman, the, two, becoming, one, flesh, the, first, man, and, woman, are, in, god, s, garden, of, eden, where, all, creation, is, vegetarian, and, there, is, no, violence, they, are, permitted, to, eat, the, fruits, of, all, the, trees, except, one, the, tree, of, the, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, the, woman, is, tempted, by, a, talking, serpent, to, eat, the, forbidden, fruit, and, gives, some, to, the, man, who, eats, also, contrary, to, popular, myth, she, does, not, beguile, the, man, who, appears, to, have, been, present, at, the, encounter, with, the, serpent, god, curses, all, three, the, man, to, a, lifetime, of, hard, labour, followed, by, death, the, woman, to, the, pain, of, childbirth, and, to, subordination, to, her, husband, and, the, serpent, to, go, on, his, belly, and, suffer, the, enmity, of, both, man, and, woman, god, then, clothes, the, nakedness, of, the, man, and, woman, who, have, become, god, like, in, knowing, good, and, evil, then, banishes, them, from, the, garden, lest, they, eat, the, fruit, of, a, second, tree, the, tree, of, life, and, live, forever, the, story, continues, in, genesis, 3, with, the, expulsion, from, eden, narrative, a, form, analysis, of, genesis, 3, reveals, that, this, portion, of, the, story, can, be, characterized, as, a, parable, or, wisdom, tale, in, the, wisdom, tradition, the, poetic, addresses, of, the, chapter, belong, to, a, speculative, type, of, wisdom, that, questions, the, paradoxes, and, harsh, realities, of, life, this, characterization, is, determined, by, the, narrative, s, format, settings, and, the, plot, the, form, of, genesis, 3, is, also, shaped, by, its, vocabulary, making, use, of, various, puns, and, double, entendres, the, expulsion, from, eden, narrative, begins, with, a, dialogue, between, the, woman, and, a, serpent, identified, in, genesis, 3, 1, as, an, animal, that, was, more, crafty, than, any, other, animal, made, by, god, although, genesis, does, not, identify, the, serpent, with, satan, the, woman, is, willing, to, talk, to, the, serpent, and, respond, to, the, creature, s, cynicism, by, repeating, god, s, prohibition, against, eating, fruit, from, the, tree, of, knowledge, genesis, 2, 17, the, woman, is, lured, into, dialogue, on, the, serpent, s, terms, which, directly, disputes, god, s, command, the, serpent, assures, the, woman, that, god, will, not, let, her, die, if, she, ate, the, fruit, and, furthermore, that, if, she, ate, the, fruit, her, eyes, would, be, opened, and, she, would, be, like, god, knowing, good, and, evil, genesis, 3, 5, the, woman, sees, that, the, fruit, of, the, tree, of, knowledge, is, a, delight, to, the, eye, and, that, it, would, be, desirable, to, acquire, wisdom, by, eating, the, fruit, the, woman, eats, the, fruit, and, gives, some, to, the, man, genesis, 3, 6, with, this, the, man, and, woman, recognize, their, own, nakedness, and, they, make, loincloths, of, fig, leaves, genesis, 3, 7, in, the, next, narrative, dialogue, god, questions, the, man, and, the, woman, genesis, 3, 8, 13, and, god, initiates, a, dialogue, by, calling, out, to, the, man, with, a, rhetorical, question, designed, to, consider, his, wrongdoing, the, man, explains, that, he, hid, in, the, garden, out, of, fear, because, he, realized, his, own, nakedness, genesis, 3, 10, this, is, followed, by, two, more, rhetorical, questions, designed, to, show, awareness, of, a, defiance, of, god, s, command, the, man, then, points, to, the, woman, as, the, real, offender, and, he, implies, that, god, is, responsible, for, the, tragedy, because, the, woman, was, given, to, him, by, god, genesis, 3, 12, god, challenges, the, woman, to, explain, herself, and, she, shifts, the, blame, to, the, serpent, genesis, 3, 13, divine, pronouncement, of, three, judgments, is, then, laid, against, all, the, culprits, genesis, 3, 14, 19, a, judgement, oracle, and, the, nature, of, the, crime, is, first, laid, upon, the, serpent, then, the, woman, and, finally, the, man, on, the, serpent, god, places, a, divine, curse, the, woman, receives, penalties, that, impact, her, in, two, primary, roles, she, shall, experience, pangs, during, childbearing, pain, during, childbirth, and, while, she, shall, desire, her, husband, he, will, rule, over, her, the, man, s, penalty, results, in, god, cursing, the, ground, from, which, he, came, and, the, man, then, receives, a, death, oracle, although, the, man, has, not, been, described, in, the, text, as, immortal, 18, abruptly, in, the, flow, of, text, in, genesis, 3, 20, the, man, names, the, woman, eve, hebrew, hawwah, because, she, was, the, mother, of, all, living, god, makes, skin, garments, for, adam, and, eve, genesis, 3, 20, the, chiasmus, structure, of, the, death, oracle, given, to, adam, in, genesis, 3, 19, is, a, link, between, man, s, creation, from, dust, genesis, 2, 7, to, the, return, of, his, beginnings, you, return, to, the, ground, since, from, it, you, were, taken, for, dust, you, are, and, to, dust, you, will, return, the, garden, account, ends, with, an, intradivine, monologue, determining, the, couple, s, expulsion, and, the, execution, of, that, deliberation, genesis, 3, 22, 24, the, reason, given, for, the, expulsion, was, to, prevent, the, man, from, eating, from, the, tree, of, life, and, becoming, immortal, behold, the, man, is, become, as, one, of, us, to, know, good, and, evil, and, now, lest, he, put, forth, his, hand, and, take, also, of, the, tree, of, life, and, eat, and, live, for, ever, genesis, 3, 22, 18, god, exiles, adam, and, eve, from, the, garden, and, installs, cherubs, supernatural, beings, that, provide, protection, and, the, ever, turning, sword, to, guard, the, entrance, genesis, 3, 24, genesis, 4, narrates, life, outside, the, garden, including, the, birth, of, adam, and, eve, s, first, children, cain, and, abel, and, the, story, of, the, first, murder, a, third, son, seth, is, born, to, adam, and, eve, and, adam, had, other, sons, and, daughters, genesis, 5, 4, genesis, 5, lists, adam, s, descendants, from, seth, to, noah, with, their, ages, at, the, birth, of, their, first, sons, and, their, ages, at, death, adam, s, age, at, death, is, given, as, 930, years, according, to, the, book, of, jubilees, cain, married, his, sister, awan, a, daughter, of, adam, and, eve, the, primeval, history, forms, the, opening, chapters, of, the, torah, the, five, books, making, up, the, history, of, the, origins, of, israel, this, achieved, something, like, its, current, form, in, the, 5th, century, bce, but, genesis, 1, 11, shows, little, relationship, to, the, rest, of, the, bible, for, example, the, names, of, its, characters, and, its, geography, adam, man, and, eve, life, the, land, of, nod, wandering, and, so, on, are, symbolic, rather, than, real, and, almost, none, of, the, persons, places, and, stories, mentioned, in, it, are, ever, met, anywhere, else, this, has, led, scholars, to, suppose, that, the, history, forms, a, late, composition, attached, to, genesis, and, the, pentateuch, to, serve, as, an, introduction, just, how, late, is, a, subject, for, debate, at, one, extreme, are, those, who, see, it, as, a, product, of, the, hellenistic, period, in, which, case, it, cannot, be, earlier, than, the, first, decades, of, the, 4th, century, bce, on, the, other, hand, the, yahwist, source, has, been, dated, by, some, scholars, notably, john, van, seters, to, the, exilic, pre, persian, period, the, 6th, century, bce, precisely, because, the, primeval, history, contains, so, much, babylonian, influence, in, the, form, of, myth, the, primeval, history, draws, on, two, distinct, sources, the, priestly, source, and, what, is, sometimes, called, the, yahwist, source, and, sometimes, simply, the, non, priestly, for, the, purpose, of, discussing, adam, and, eve, in, the, book, of, genesis, the, terms, non, priestly, and, yahwist, can, be, regarded, as, interchangeable, it, was, also, recognized, in, ancient, judaism, that, there, are, two, distinct, accounts, for, the, creation, of, man, the, first, account, says, male, and, female, created, them, implying, simultaneous, creation, whereas, the, second, account, states, that, god, created, eve, subsequent, to, the, creation, of, adam, the, midrash, rabbah, genesis, viii, 1, reconciled, the, two, by, stating, that, genesis, one, male, and, female, he, created, them, indicates, that, god, originally, created, adam, as, a, hermaphrodite, bodily, and, spiritually, both, male, and, female, before, creating, the, separate, beings, of, adam, and, eve, other, rabbis, suggested, that, eve, and, the, woman, of, the, first, account, were, two, separate, individuals, the, first, being, identified, as, lilith, a, figure, elsewhere, described, as, a, night, demon, according, to, traditional, jewish, belief, adam, and, eve, are, buried, in, the, cave, of, machpelah, in, hebron, in, genesis, 2, 7, god, breathes, into, the, man, s, nostrils, and, he, becomes, nefesh, hayya, signifying, something, like, the, english, word, being, in, the, sense, of, a, corporeal, body, capable, of, life, the, concept, of, a, soul, in, the, modern, sense, did, not, exist, in, hebrew, thought, until, around, the, 2nd, century, bc, when, the, idea, of, a, bodily, resurrection, gained, popularity, some, early, fathers, of, the, christian, church, held, eve, responsible, for, the, fall, of, man, and, all, subsequent, women, to, be, the, first, sinners, because, eve, tempted, adam, to, commit, the, taboo, you, are, the, devil, s, gateway, tertullian, told, his, female, readers, and, went, on, to, explain, that, they, were, responsible, for, the, death, of, christ, on, account, of, your, desert, even, the, son, of, god, had, to, die, in, 1486, the, dominicans, kramer, and, sprengler, used, similar, tracts, in, malleus, maleficarum, hammer, of, witches, to, justify, the, persecution, of, witches, medieval, christian, art, often, depicted, the, edenic, serpent, as, a, woman, often, identified, as, lilith, thus, both, emphasizing, the, serpent, s, seductiveness, as, well, as, its, relationship, to, eve, several, early, church, fathers, including, clement, of, alexandria, and, eusebius, of, caesarea, interpreted, the, hebrew, heva, as, not, only, the, name, of, eve, but, in, its, aspirated, form, as, female, serpent, based, on, the, christian, doctrine, of, the, fall, of, man, came, the, doctrine, of, original, sin, st, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, working, with, the, epistle, to, the, romans, interpreted, the, apostle, paul, as, having, said, that, adam, s, sin, was, hereditary, death, passed, upon, all, men, because, of, adam, all, sinned, romans, 5, 12, original, sin, became, a, concept, that, man, is, born, into, a, condition, of, sinfulness, and, must, await, redemption, this, doctrine, became, a, cornerstone, of, the, western, christian, theological, tradition, which, however, not, shared, by, judaism, or, the, orthodox, churches, over, the, centuries, a, system, of, unique, christian, beliefs, had, developed, from, these, doctrines, baptism, became, understood, as, a, washing, away, of, the, stain, of, hereditary, sin, in, many, churches, although, its, original, symbolism, was, apparently, rebirth, additionally, the, serpent, that, tempted, eve, was, interpreted, to, have, been, satan, or, that, satan, was, using, a, serpent, as, a, mouthpiece, although, there, is, no, mention, of, this, identification, in, the, torah, and, it, is, not, held, in, judaism, as, well, as, developing, the, theology, of, the, protoplasts, the, medieval, church, also, expanded, the, historical, narrative, in, a, vast, tradition, of, adam, books, which, add, detail, to, the, fall, and, tell, of, their, life, after, the, expulsion, from, eden, these, are, continued, in, the, legend, of, the, rood, dealing, with, seth, s, return, to, paradise, and, subsequent, events, involving, the, wood, from, the, tree, of, life, these, stories, were, widely, believed, in, europe, until, early, modern, times, regarding, the, real, existence, of, the, progenitors, as, of, other, narratives, contained, in, genesis, the, catholic, church, teaches, that, adam, and, eve, were, historical, humans, personally, responsible, for, the, original, sin, this, position, was, clarified, by, pope, pius, xii, in, the, encyclical, humani, generis, in, which, the, pope, condemned, the, theory, of, polygenism, and, expressed, that, original, sin, comes, from, a, sin, actually, committed, by, an, individual, adam, despite, this, the, humani, generis, also, states, that, the, belief, in, evolution, is, not, in, contrast, to, catholic, doctrine, this, has, led, to, a, gradual, acceptance, of, theistic, evolution, among, roman, catholic, and, independent, catholic, theologians, a, position, that, has, been, encouraged, by, pope, john, paul, ii, pope, benedict, xvi, and, pope, francis, the, biblical, fall, of, adam, and, eve, is, also, understood, by, some, christians, especially, those, in, the, eastern, orthodox, tradition, as, a, reality, outside, of, empirical, history, that, effects, the, entire, history, of, the, universe, this, concept, of, an, atemporal, fall, has, been, most, recently, expounded, by, the, orthodox, theologians, david, bentley, hart, john, behr, and, sergei, bulgakov, but, it, has, roots, in, the, writings, of, several, early, church, fathers, especially, origen, and, maximus, the, confessor, bulgakov, writes, in, his, 1939, book, the, bride, of, the, lamb, translated, by, boris, jakim, wm, b, eerdmans, 2001, that, empirical, history, begins, precisely, with, the, fall, which, is, its, starting, premise, and, that, in, the, narrative, in, genesis, 3, an, event, is, described, that, lies, beyond, our, history, although, at, its, boundary, david, bentley, hart, has, written, about, this, concept, of, an, atemporal, fall, in, his, 2005, book, the, doors, of, the, sea, as, well, as, in, his, essay, the, devil, s, march, creatio, ex, nihilo, the, problem, of, evil, and, a, few, dostoyevskian, meditations, from, his, 2020, book, theological, territories, gnostics, discussed, adam, and, eve, in, two, known, surviving, texts, namely, the, apocalypse, of, adam, found, in, the, nag, hammadi, documents, and, the, testament, of, adam, the, creation, of, adam, as, protoanthropos, the, original, man, is, the, focal, concept, of, these, writings, another, gnostic, tradition, held, that, adam, and, eve, were, created, to, help, defeat, satan, the, serpent, instead, of, being, identified, with, satan, is, seen, as, a, hero, by, the, ophites, still, other, gnostics, believed, that, satan, s, fall, however, came, after, the, creation, of, humanity, as, in, islamic, tradition, this, story, says, that, satan, refused, to, bow, to, adam, due, to, pride, satan, said, that, adam, was, inferior, to, him, as, he, was, made, of, fire, whereas, adam, was, made, of, clay, this, refusal, led, to, the, fall, of, satan, recorded, in, works, such, as, the, book, of, enoch, in, mandaeism, god, created, all, the, worlds, formed, the, soul, through, his, power, and, placed, it, by, means, of, angels, into, the, human, body, so, he, created, adam, and, eve, the, first, man, and, woman, in, islam, adam, dam, arabic, whose, role, is, being, the, father, of, humanity, is, looked, upon, by, muslims, with, reverence, eve, aww, arabic, is, the, mother, of, humanity, the, creation, of, adam, and, eve, is, referred, to, in, the, qur, n, although, different, qur, anic, interpreters, give, different, views, on, the, actual, creation, story, qur, an, surat, al, nisa, verse, 1, in, al, qummi, s, tafsir, on, the, garden, of, eden, such, a, place, was, not, entirely, earthly, according, to, the, qur, n, both, adam, and, eve, ate, the, forbidden, fruit, in, a, heavenly, eden, as, a, result, they, were, both, sent, down, to, earth, as, god, s, representatives, each, person, was, sent, to, a, mountain, peak, adam, on, al, safa, and, eve, on, al, marwah, in, this, islamic, tradition, adam, wept, for, 40, days, until, he, repented, after, which, god, sent, down, the, black, stone, teaching, him, the, hajj, according, to, a, prophetic, hadith, adam, and, eve, reunited, in, the, plain, of, arafat, near, mecca, they, had, multiple, children, particularly, qabil, and, habil, there, is, also, a, legend, of, a, younger, son, named, rocail, who, created, a, palace, and, sepulchre, containing, autonomous, statues, that, lived, out, the, lives, of, men, so, realistically, they, were, mistaken, for, having, souls, the, concept, of, original, sin, does, not, exist, in, islam, because, according, to, islam, adam, and, eve, were, forgiven, by, god, when, god, orders, the, angels, to, bow, to, adam, ibl, s, questioned, why, should, i, bow, to, man, i, am, made, of, pure, fire, and, he, is, made, of, soil, the, liberal, movements, within, islam, have, viewed, god, s, commanding, the, angels, to, bow, before, adam, as, an, exaltation, of, humanity, and, as, a, means, of, supporting, human, rights, others, view, it, as, an, act, of, showing, adam, that, the, biggest, enemy, of, humans, on, earth, will, be, their, ego, in, swahili, literature, eve, ate, from, the, forbidden, tree, thus, causing, her, expulsion, after, being, tempted, by, iblis, thereupon, adam, heroically, eats, the, forbidden, fruit, in, order, to, follow, eve, and, protect, her, on, earth, in, the, bah, faith, adam, is, regarded, as, the, first, manifestation, of, god, the, adam, and, eve, narrative, is, seen, as, symbolic, in, some, answered, questions, abdu, l, bah, rejects, a, literal, reading, and, states, that, the, story, contains, divine, mysteries, and, universal, meanings, adam, symbolizes, the, spirit, of, adam, eve, symbolizes, his, self, the, tree, of, knowledge, symbolizes, the, material, world, and, the, serpent, symbolizes, attachment, to, the, material, world, the, fall, of, adam, thus, represents, the, way, humanity, became, conscious, of, good, and, evil, in, another, sense, adam, and, eve, represent, god, s, will, and, determination, the, first, two, of, the, seven, stages, of, divine, creative, action, while, a, traditional, view, attributes, the, book, of, genesis, to, mosaic, authorship, modern, scholars, consider, the, genesis, creation, narrative, as, one, of, various, ancient, origin, myths, analysis, like, the, documentary, hypothesis, also, suggests, that, the, text, is, a, result, of, the, compilation, of, multiple, previous, traditions, explaining, apparent, contradictions, other, stories, of, the, same, canonical, book, like, the, genesis, flood, narrative, are, also, understood, as, having, been, influenced, by, older, literature, with, parallels, in, the, older, epic, of, gilgamesh, scientific, developments, within, the, natural, sciences, have, shown, evidence, that, humans, and, all, other, living, and, extinct, species, share, a, common, ancestor, and, evolved, through, natural, processes, over, billions, of, years, to, diversify, into, the, life, forms, we, know, today, in, biology, the, most, recent, common, ancestors, of, humans, when, traced, back, using, the, y, chromosome, for, the, male, lineage, and, mitochondrial, dna, for, the, female, lineage, are, commonly, called, the, y, chromosomal, adam, and, mitochondrial, eve, respectively, anatomically, modern, humans, emerged, in, africa, approximately, 300, 000, years, ago, the, matrilineal, most, recent, common, ancestor, lived, around, 155, 000, years, ago, while, the, patrilineal, most, recent, common, ancestor, lived, around, 200, 000, to, 300, 000, years, ago, these, do, not, fork, from, a, single, couple, at, the, same, epoch, even, though, the, names, were, borrowed, from, the, tanakh, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, a, famous, 17th, century, epic, poem, written,
