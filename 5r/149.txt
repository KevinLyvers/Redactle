indicates, that, some, people, believed, that, the, goddess, inanna, ereshkigal, s, younger, sister, had, the, power, to, award, her, devotees, with, special, favors, in, the, afterlife, during, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, it, was, believed, that, a, person, s, treatment, in, the, afterlife, depended, on, how, he, or, she, was, buried, 58, those, that, had, been, given, sumptuous, burials, would, be, treated, well, 58, but, those, who, had, been, given, poor, burials, would, fare, poorly, 58, the, entrance, to, kur, was, believed, to, be, located, in, the, zagros, mountains, in, the, far,

be, considered, a, hell, the, classic, hades, on, the, other, hand, is, more, similar, to, old, testament, sheol, the, romans, later, adopted, these, views, the, hell, of, swahili, mythology, is, called, kuzimu, and, belief, in, it, developed, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, century, under, the, influence, of, muslim, merchants, at, the, east, african, coast, it, is, imagined, as, a, very, cold, place, serer, religion, rejects, the, general, notion, of, heaven, and, hell, in, serer, religion, acceptance, by, the, ancestors, who, have, long, departed, is, as, close, to, any, heaven, as, one, can, get, rejection, and, becoming, a, wandering, soul, is, a, sort, of, hell, for, one, passing, over, the, souls, of, the, dead, must, make, their, way, to, jaaniw, the, sacred, dwelling, place, of, the, soul, only, those, who, have, lived, their, lives, on, earth, in, accordance, with, serer, doctrines, will, be, able, to, make, this, necessary, journey, and, thus, be, accepted, by, the,

fathers, the, bagobo, of, the, philippines, have, the, otherworld, gimokodan, where, the, red, region, is, reserved, who, those, who, died, in, battle, while, ordinary, people, go, to, the, white, region, according, to, a, few, sources, hell, is, below, ground, and, described, as, an, uninviting, wet, or, fiery, place, reserved, for, sinful, people, in, the, ainu, religion, as, stated, by, missionary, john, batchelor, however, belief, in, hell, does, not, appear, in, oral, tradition, of, the, ainu, instead, there, is, belief, within, the, ainu, religion, that, the, soul, of, the, deceased, ramat, would, become, a, kamuy, after, death, there, is, also, belief, that, the, soul, of, someone, who, has, been, wicked, during, lifetime, committed, suicide, got, murdered, or, died, in, great, agony, would, become, a, ghost, tukap, who, would, haunt, the, living, to, come, to, fulfillment, from, which, it, was, excluded, during, life, judaism, does, not, have, a, specific, doctrine, about, the, afterlife, but, it, does, have, a, mystical, orthodox, tradition, of, describing, gehinnom, gehinnom, is, not, hell, but, originally, a, grave, and, in, later, times, a, sort, of, purgatory, where, one, is, judged, based, on, one, s, life, s, deeds, or, rather, where, one, becomes, fully, aware, of, one, s, own, shortcomings, and, negative, actions, during, one, s, life, the, kabbalah, explains, it, as, a, waiting, room, commonly, translated, as, an, entry, way, for, all, souls, not, just, the, wicked, the, overwhelming, majority, of, rabbinic, thought, maintains, that, people, are, not, in, gehinnom, forever, the, longest, that, one, can, be, there, is, said, to, be, 12, months, however, there, has, been, the, occasional, noted, exception, some, consider, it, a, spiritual, forge, where, the, soul, is, purified, for, its, eventual, ascent, to, olam, habah, heb, lit, the, world, to, come, often, viewed, as, analogous, to, heaven, this, is, also, mentioned, in, the, kabbalah, where, the, soul, is, described, as, breaking, like, the, flame, of, a, candle, lighting, another, the, part, of, the, soul, that, ascends, being, pure, and, the, unfinished, piece, being, reborn, according, to, jewish, teachings, hell, is, not, entirely, physical, rather, it, can, be, compared, to, a, very, intense, feeling, of, shame, people, are, ashamed, of, their, misdeeds, and, this, constitutes, suffering, which, makes, up, for, the, bad, deeds, when, one, has, so, deviated, from, the, will, of, god, one, is, said, to, be, in, gehinnom, this, is, not, meant, to, refer, to, some, point, in, the, future, but, to, the, very, present, moment, the, gates, of, teshuva, return, are, said, to, be, always, open, and, so, one, can, align, his, will, with, that, of, god, at, any, moment, being, out, of, alignment, with, god, s, will, is, itself, a, punishment, according, to, the, torah, many, scholars, of, jewish, mysticism, particularly, of, the, kabbalah, describe, seven, compartments, or, habitations, of, hell, just, as, they, describe, seven, divisions, of, heaven, these, divisions, go, by, many, different, names, and, the, most, frequently, mentioned, are, as, follows, besides, those, mentioned, above, there, also, exist, additional, terms, that, have, been, often, used, to, either, refer, to, hell, in, general, or, to, some, region, of, the, underworld, maimonides, declares, in, his, 13, principles, of, faith, that, the, hells, of, the, rabbinic, literature, were, pedagogically, motivated, inventions, to, encourage, respect, of, the, torah, commandments, by, mankind, which, had, been, regarded, as, immature, instead, of, being, sent, to, hell, the, souls, of, the, wicked, would, actually, get, annihilated, the, christian, doctrine, of, hell, derives, from, passages, in, the, new, testament, the, english, word, hell, does, not, appear, in, the, greek, new, testament, instead, one, of, three, words, is, used, the, greek, words, tartarus, or, hades, or, the, hebrew, word, gehinnom, in, the, septuagint, and, new, testament, the, authors, used, the, greek, term, hades, for, the, hebrew, sheol, but, often, with, jewish, rather, than, greek, concepts, in, mind, in, the, jewish, concept, of, sheol, such, as, expressed, in, ecclesiastes, sheol, or, hades, is, a, place, where, there, is, no, activity, however, since, augustine, some, christians, have, believed, that, the, souls, of, those, who, die, either, rest, peacefully, in, the, case, of, christians, or, are, afflicted, in, the, case, of, the, damned, after, death, until, the, resurrection, while, these, three, terms, are, translated, in, the, kjv, as, hell, they, have, three, very, different, meanings, according, to, the, roman, catholic, church, the, council, of, trent, taught, in, the, 5th, canon, of, its, 14th, session, that, damnation, is, eternal, the, loss, of, eternal, blessedness, and, the, eternal, damnation, which, he, has, incurred, the, catholic, church, defines, hell, as, a, state, of, definitive, self, exclusion, from, communion, with, god, and, the, blessed, one, finds, oneself, in, hell, as, the, result, of, dying, in, mortal, sin, without, repenting, and, accepting, god, s, merciful, love, becoming, eternally, separated, from, him, by, one, s, own, free, choice, immediately, after, death, in, the, roman, catholic, church, many, other, christian, churches, such, as, the, methodists, baptists, and, episcopalians, and, some, greek, orthodox, churches, hell, is, taught, as, the, final, destiny, of, those, who, have, not, been, found, worthy, after, the, general, resurrection, and, last, judgment, where, they, will, be, eternally, punished, for, sin, and, permanently, separated, from, god, the, nature, of, this, judgment, is, inconsistent, with, many, protestant, churches, teaching, the, saving, comes, from, accepting, jesus, christ, as, their, savior, while, the, greek, orthodox, and, catholic, churches, teach, that, the, judgment, hinges, on, both, faith, and, works, however, many, liberal, christians, throughout, mainline, protestant, churches, believe, in, universal, reconciliation, see, below, even, though, it, contradicts, the, traditional, doctrines, that, are, usually, held, by, the, evangelicals, within, their, denominations, regarding, the, belief, in, hell, the, interpretation, of, extra, ecclesiam, nulla, salus, is, also, relevant, some, modern, christian, theologians, subscribe, to, the, doctrines, of, conditional, immortality, conditional, immortality, is, the, belief, that, the, soul, dies, with, the, body, and, does, not, live, again, until, the, resurrection, as, with, other, jewish, writings, of, the, second, temple, period, the, new, testament, text, distinguishes, two, words, both, translated, hell, in, older, english, bibles, hades, the, grave, and, gehenna, where, god, can, destroy, both, body, and, soul, a, minority, of, christians, read, this, to, mean, that, neither, hades, nor, gehenna, are, eternal, but, refer, to, the, ultimate, destruction, of, the, wicked, in, the, lake, of, fire, in, a, consuming, fire, after, resurrection, however, because, of, the, greek, words, used, in, translating, from, the, hebrew, text, the, hebrew, ideas, have, become, confused, with, greek, myths, and, ideas, in, the, hebrew, text, when, people, died, they, went, to, sheol, the, grave, and, the, wicked, ultimately, went, to, gehenna, and, were, consumed, by, fire, the, hebrew, words, for, the, grave, or, death, or, eventual, destruction, of, the, wicked, were, translated, using, greek, words, and, later, texts, became, a, mix, of, mistranslation, pagan, influence, and, greek, myth, christian, mortalism, is, the, doctrine, that, all, men, and, women, including, christians, must, die, and, do, not, continue, and, are, not, conscious, after, death, therefore, annihilationism, includes, the, doctrine, that, the, wicked, are, also, destroyed, rather, than, tormented, forever, in, traditional, hell, or, the, lake, of, fire, christian, mortalism, and, annihilationism, are, directly, related, to, the, doctrine, of, conditional, immortality, the, idea, that, a, human, soul, is, not, immortal, unless, it, is, given, eternal, life, at, the, second, coming, of, christ, and, resurrection, of, the, dead, biblical, scholars, looking, at, the, issue, through, the, hebrew, text, have, denied, the, teaching, of, innate, immortality, rejection, of, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, advocacy, of, christian, mortalism, was, a, feature, of, protestantism, since, the, early, days, of, the, reformation, with, martin, luther, himself, rejecting, the, traditional, idea, though, his, mortalism, did, not, carry, into, orthodox, lutheranism, one, of, the, most, notable, english, opponents, of, the, immortality, of, the, soul, was, thomas, hobbes, who, describes, the, idea, as, a, greek, contagion, in, christian, doctrine, modern, proponents, of, conditional, immortality, include, some, in, the, anglican, church, such, as, n, t, wright, and, as, denominations, the, seventh, day, adventists, bible, students, jehovah, s, witnesses, christadelphians, living, church, of, god, church, of, god, international, and, some, other, protestant, christians, the, catholic, catechism, states, the, souls, of, sinners, descend, into, hell, where, they, suffer, eternal, fire, however, cardinal, vincent, nichols, the, most, senior, catholic, in, england, and, wales, said, there, s, nowhere, in, catholic, teaching, that, actually, says, any, one, person, is, in, hell, the, 1993, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, states, this, state, of, definitive, self, exclusion, from, communion, with, god, and, the, blessed, is, called, hell, and, they, suffer, the, punishments, of, hell, eternal, fire, the, chief, punishment, of, hell, is, eternal, separation, from, god, ccc, 1035, during, an, audience, in, 1999, pope, john, paul, ii, commented, images, of, hell, that, sacred, scripture, presents, to, us, must, be, correctly, interpreted, they, show, the, complete, frustration, and, emptiness, of, life, without, god, rather, than, a, place, hell, indicates, the, state, of, those, who, freely, and, definitively, separate, themselves, from, god, the, source, of, all, life, and, joy, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, s, official, beliefs, support, annihilationism, they, deny, the, catholic, purgatory, and, teach, that, the, dead, lie, in, the, grave, until, they, are, raised, for, a, last, judgment, both, the, righteous, and, wicked, await, the, resurrection, at, the, second, coming, seventh, day, adventists, believe, that, death, is, a, state, of, unconscious, sleep, until, the, resurrection, they, base, this, belief, on, biblical, texts, such, as, ecclesiastes, 9, 5, which, states, the, dead, know, nothing, and, 1, thessalonians, 4, 13, 18, which, contains, a, description, of, the, dead, being, raised, from, the, grave, at, the, second, coming, these, verses, it, is, argued, indicate, that, death, is, only, a, period, or, form, of, slumber, adventists, teach, that, the, resurrection, of, the, righteous, will, take, place, shortly, after, the, second, coming, of, jesus, as, described, in, revelation, 20, 4, 6, that, follows, revelation, 19, 11, 16, whereas, the, resurrection, of, the, wicked, will, occur, after, the, millennium, as, described, in, revelation, 20, 5, and, 20, 12, 13, that, follow, revelation, 20, 4, and, 6, 7, though, revelation, 20, 12, 13, and, 15, actually, describe, a, mixture, of, saved, and, condemned, people, being, raised, from, the, dead, and, judged, adventists, reject, the, traditional, doctrine, of, hell, as, a, state, of, everlasting, conscious, torment, believing, instead, that, the, wicked, will, be, permanently, destroyed, after, the, millennium, by, the, lake, of, fire, which, is, called, the, second, death, in, revelation, 20, 14, those, adventist, doctrines, about, death, and, hell, reflect, an, underlying, belief, in, a, conditional, immortality, or, conditionalism, as, opposed, to, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, b, the, monistic, nature, of, human, beings, in, which, the, soul, is, not, separable, from, the, body, as, opposed, to, bipartite, or, tripartite, conceptions, in, which, the, soul, is, separable, jehovah, s, witnesses, hold, that, the, soul, ceases, to, exist, when, the, person, dies, and, therefore, that, hell, sheol, or, hades, is, a, state, of, non, existence, in, their, theology, gehenna, differs, from, sheol, or, hades, in, that, it, holds, no, hope, of, a, resurrection, tartarus, is, held, to, be, the, metaphorical, state, of, debasement, of, the, fallen, angels, between, the, time, of, their, moral, fall, genesis, chapter, 6, until, their, post, millennial, destruction, along, with, satan, revelation, chapter, 20, bible, students, and, christadelphians, also, believe, in, annihilationism, christian, universalists, believe, in, universal, reconciliation, the, belief, that, all, human, souls, will, be, eventually, reconciled, with, god, and, admitted, to, heaven, this, belief, is, held, by, some, unitarian, universalists, according, to, emanuel, swedenborg, s, second, coming, christian, revelation, hell, exists, because, evil, people, want, it, they, not, god, introduced, evil, to, the, human, race, in, swedenborgianism, every, soul, joins, the, like, minded, group, after, death, in, which, it, feels, the, most, comfortable, hell, is, therefore,

s, and, the, dharmashashtra, s, naraka, is, a, place, of, punishment, for, misdeeds, it, is, a, lower, spiritual, plane, called, naraka, loka, where, the, spirit, is, judged, and, the, partial, fruits, of, karma, affect, the, next, life, in, the, mahabharata, there, is, a, mention, of, the, pandavas, and, the, kauravas, both, going, to, heaven, at, first, yudhishthira, goes, to, heaven, where, he, sees, duryodhana, enjoying, the, realm, indra, tells, him, that, duryodhana, is, in, heaven, as, he, had, adequately, performed, his, kshatriya, duties, then, he, shows, yudhishthira, hell, where, it, appears, his, brothers, are, later, it, is, revealed, that, this, was, a, test, for, yudhishthira, and, that, his, brothers, and, the, kauravas, are, all, in, heaven, and, live, happily, in, the, divine, abode, of, the, devas, various, hells, are, also, described, in, various, puranas, and, other, scriptures, the, garuda, purana, gives, a, detailed, account, of, each, hell, and, its, features, it, lists, the, amount, of, punishment, for, most, crimes, much, like, a, modern, day, penal, code, it, is, believed, that, people, who, commit, misdeeds, go, to, hell, and, have, to, go, through, punishments, in, accordance, with, the, misdeeds, they, committed, the, god, yama, who, is, also, the, god, of, death, presides, over, hell, detailed, accounts, of, all, the, misdeeds,

great, suffering, however, a, naraka, differs, from, the, hells, of, abrahamic, religions, as, souls, are, not, sent, to, naraka, as, the, result, of, a, divine, judgment, and, punishment, furthermore, length, of, a, being, s, stay, in, a, naraka, is, not, eternal, though, it, is, usually, very, long, and, measured, in, billions, of, years, a, soul, is, born, into, a, naraka, as, a, direct, result, of, his, or, her, previous, karma, actions, of, body, speech, and, mind, and, resides, there, for, a, finite, length, of, time, until, his, karma, has, achieved, its, full, result, after, his, karma, is, used, up, he, may, be, reborn, in, one, of, the, higher, worlds, as, the, result, of, an, earlier, karma, that, had, not, yet, ripened, the, hells, are, situated, in, the, seven, grounds, at, the, lower, part, of, the, universe, the, seven, grounds, are, the, hellish, beings, are, a, type, of, souls, which, are, residing, in, these, various, hells, they, are, born, in,

from, ten, thousand, to, billions, of, years, in, the, respective, hells, where, they, reside, according, to, jain, scripture, tattvarthasutra, following, are, the, causes, for, birth, in, hell, according, to, meivazhi, the, purpose, of, all, religions, is, to, guide, people, to, heaven, however, those, who, do, not, approach, god, and, are, not, blessed, by, him, are, believed, to, be, condemned, to, hell, in, sikh, thought, heaven, and, hell, are, not, places, for, living, hereafter, they, are, part, of, spiritual, topography, of, man, and, do, not, exist, otherwise, they, refer, to, good, and, evil, stages, of, life, respectively, and, can, be, lived, now, and, here, during, our, earthly, existence, for, example, guru, arjan, explains, that, people, who, are, entangled, in, emotional, attachment, and, doubt, are, living, in, hell, on, this, earth, i, e, their, life, is, hellish, so, many, are, being, drowned, in, emotional, attachment, and, doubt, they, dwell, in, the, most, horrible, hell, ancient, taoism, had, no, concept, of, hell, as, morality, was, seen, to, be, a, man, made, distinction, and, there, was, no, concept, of, an, immaterial, soul, in, its, home, country, china, where, taoism, adopted, tenets, of, other, religions, popular, belief, endows, taoist, hell, with, many, deities, and, spirits, who, punish, sin, in, a, variety, of, horrible, ways, buddhist, hells, became, so, much, a, part, of, that, during, funeral, services, the, priests, hang, up, scrolls, depicting, similar, scenes, typically, daoist, hells, are, said, to, be, ten, in, number, and, are, sometimes, said, to, be, situated, under, a, high, mountain, in, sichuan, each, is, ruled, by, a, king, serving, as, judge, surrounded, by, ministers, and, attendants, who, carry, out, his, decisions, punishment, is, usually, inflicted, with, the, use, of, torture, instruments, although, there, are, some, non, physical, and, more, metaphysical, punishments, however, this, type, of, daoist, hell, is, usually, not, final, and, a, soul, will, make, a, journey, of, refining, by, going, through, at, least, several, hells, and, their, punishments, until, it, is, reincarnated, into, another, body, in, the, human, world, diyu, is, the, realm, of, the, dead, in, chinese, mythology, it, is, very, loosely, based, upon, the, buddhist, concept, of, naraka, combined, with, traditional, chinese, afterlife, beliefs, and, a, variety, of, popular, expansions, and, re, interpretations, of, these, two, traditions, ruled, by, yanluo, wang, the, king, of, hell, diyu, is, a, maze, of, underground, levels, and, chambers, where, souls, are, taken, to, atone, for, their, earthly, sins, incorporating, ideas, from, taoism, and, buddhism, as, well, as, traditional, chinese, folk, religion, diyu, is, a, kind, of, purgatory, place, which, serves, not, only, to, punish, but, also, to, renew, spirits, ready, for, their, next, incarnation, there, are, many, deities, associated, with, the, place, whose, names, and, purposes, are, the, subject, of, much, conflicting, information, the, exact, number, of, levels, in, chinese, hell, and, their, associated, deities, differs, according, to, the, buddhist, or, taoist, perception, some, speak, of, three, to, four, courts, other, as, many, as, ten, the, ten, judges, are, also, known, as, the, 10, kings, of, yama, each, court, deals, with, a, different, aspect, of, atonement, for, example, murder, is, punished, in, one, court, adultery, in, another, according, to, some, chinese, legends, there, are, eighteen, levels, in, hell, punishment, also, varies, according, to, belief, but, most, legends, speak, of, highly, imaginative, chambers, where, wrong, doers, are, sawn, in, half, beheaded, thrown, into, pits, of, filth, or, forced, to, climb, trees, adorned, with, sharp, blades, however, most, legends, agree, that, once, a, soul, usually, referred, to, as, a, ghost, has, atoned, for, their, deeds, and, repented, he, or, she, is, given, the, drink, of, forgetfulness, by, meng, po, and, sent, back, into, the, world, to, be, reborn, possibly, as, an, animal, or, a, poor, or, sick, person, for, further, punishment, zoroastrianism, has, historically, suggested, several, possible, fates, for, the, wicked, including, annihilation, purgation, in, molten, metal, and, eternal, punishment, all, of, which, have, standing, in, zoroaster, s, writings, zoroastrian, eschatology, includes, the, belief, that, wicked, souls, will, remain, in, duzakh, until, following, the, arrival, of, three, saviors, at,

those, that, are, of, an, evil, dominion, of, evil, deeds, evil, words, evil, self, and, evil, thought, liars, however, the, best, known, zoroastrian, text, to, describe, hell, in, detail, is, the, book, of, arda, viraf, it, depicts, particular, punishments, for, particular, sins, for, instance, being, trampled, by, cattle, as, punishment, for, neglecting, the, needs, of, work, animals, other, descriptions, can, be, found, in, the, book, of, scriptures, hadhokht, nask, religious, judgments, dadestan, i, denig, and, the, spirit, of, wisdom, menog, i, khrad, the, mandaeans, believe, in,

would, wish, to, die, a, second, death, which, would, however, not, yet, befall, their, spirit, at, the, end, of, days, the, souls, of, the, mandaeans, which, could, be, purified, would, be,
