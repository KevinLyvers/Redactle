the, patron, goddess, of, lawful, marriage, she, presides, over, weddings, blesses, and, legalises, marital, unions, and, protects, women, from, harm, during, childbirth, her, sacred, animals, include, the, cow, cuckoo, and, peacock, she, is, sometimes, shown, holding, a, pomegranate, as, an, emblem, of, immortality, her, roman, counterpart, is, juno, the, name, hera, h, ra, or, h, r, has, several, possible, and, mutually, exclusive, etymologies, one, possibility, is, to, connect, it, with, greek, h, ra, season, and, to, interpret, it, as, ripe, for, marriage, and, according, to, plato, erat, beloved, as, zeus, is, said, to, have, married, her, for, love, according, to, plutarch, hera, was, an, allegorical, name, and, an, anagram, of, a, r, air, so, begins, the, section, on, hera, in, walter, burkert, s, greek, religion, in, a, note, he, records, other, scholars, arguments, for, the, meaning, mistress, as, a, feminine, to, heros, master, with, uncertain, origin, john, chadwick, a, decipherer, of, linear, b, remarks, her, name, may, be, connected, with, h, r, s, hero, but, that, is, no, help, since, it, too, is, etymologically, obscure, a, j, van, windekens, offers, young, cow, heifer, which, is, consonant, with, hera, s, common, epithet, bo, pis, cow, eyed, r, s, p, beekes, has, suggested, a, pre, greek, origin, her, name, is, attested, in, mycenaean, greek, written, in, the, linear, b, syllabic, script, as, e, ra, appearing, on, tablets, found, in, pylos, and, thebes, as, well, as, in, the, cypriotic, dialect, in, the, dative, e, ra, i, the, pie, could, be, originally, either, a, the, female, who, is, attached, coupled, or, b, the, female, who, attaches, herself, both, socially, and, physically, or, emotionally, many, theophoric, names, such, as, heracles, heraclitus, herodotus, herodicus, derive, from, hera, hera, bore, several, epithets, in, the, mythological, tradition, and, in, literature, in, the, historical, times, the, majority, of, the, greeks, recognized, hera, as, the, consort, of, zeus, hera, is, the, protector, of, marriage, and, of, the, rights, of, the, married, women, in, some, cults, she, has, some, functions, of, the, earth, goddess, she, is, occasionally, related, to, warfare, as, tutelary, goddess, in, historical, times, the, majority, of, the, greeks, recognized, hera, as, the, consort, of, zeus, zeus, was, the, protector, of, rights, and, mores, and, his, partner, hera, became, the, protector, of, legal, marriage, and, the, rights, of, married, women, hera, emerged, from, a, form, of, the, mycenean, goddess, of, the, palace, and, became, the, spouse, of, zeus, modern, scholars, suggest, that, hera, is, not, only, the, olympian, sky, goddess, but, in, some, cults, she, may, be, identified, with, the, earth, goddess, her, ancient, connection, with, her, sacred, animal, the, cow, still, existed, in, historical, times, she, is, probably, related, to, near, eastern, forms, of, cow, goddesses, such, as, hathor, or, bat, the, greek, earth, goddess, gaia, is, occasionally, identified, with, hera, gaia, may, be, related, to, the, vedic, earth, goddess, prithvi, who, was, also, associated, with, the, cow, an, inscription, in, linear, b, on, a, tablet, found, at, pylos, mentions, offerings, to, zeus, hera, drimios, drimios, is, the, son, of, zeus, hera, was, the, tutelary, goddess, of, argos, and, it, is, possible, that, she, had, mycenean, origin, martin, p, nilsson, suggested, that, hera, is, mainly, the, argei, a, name, given, by, homer, which, describes, her, not, as, greek, but, as, an, argive, goddess, she, is, the, protectress, of, the, citadel, in, literature, argos, is, called, d, ma, h, ras, the, house, of, hera, and, the, argives, are, called, her, people, by, pindar, homer, in, iliad, uses, the, formula, bo, pis, potnia, h, r, cow, eyed, mistress, hera, which, probably, relates, her, to, a, form, of, the, mediterranean, goddess, of, nature, the, epithet, qo, wi, ja, bo, pis, appears, in, a, linear, b, inscription, walter, burkert, notices, that, it, is, difficult, to, confirm, that, the, epithet, bowpis, corresponds, to, a, greek, belief, however, it, is, possible, that, hera, was, conceived, as, a, cow, in, her, archaic, cults, hera, exists, as, a, spouse, of, zeus, and, their, sacred, marriage, was, celebrated, in, many, greek, festivals, in, a, processional, ceremony, from, ancient, times, the, myth, of, the, premarital, approach, of, hera, by, zeus, is, early, mentioned, by, homer, it, is, possible, that, the, myth, has, its, origins, to, an, old, custom, of, the, european, country, population, the, premarital, intercourse, of, the, engaged, couple, according, to, walter, burkert, the, mediterranean, goddess, of, nature, becomes, the, bride, of, the, greek, sky, god, he, notices, that, the, disappearance, and, retrieval, of, hera, has, parallels, with, other, fertility, cults, hera, was, originally, a, goddess, of, fertility, in, her, fest, toneia, at, samos, and, at, knossos, in, crete, at, samos, the, image, of, hera, was, hidden, bounted, in, willows, and, the, participants, tried, to, discover, it, at, knossos, zeus, is, mating, with, the, earth, goddess, finally, named, hera, in, a, very, ancient, ritual, in, her, festival, daedala, at, plataia, there, is, an, account, of, hera, s, quarrel, with, zeus, and, their, reconciliation, in, crete, the, bull, was, associated, with, religious, practices, in, the, legend, of, the, minotaur, the, queen, of, knossos, is, hidden, inside, an, artificial, hollow, cow, and, she, is, mating, with, a, bull, form, god, in, a, sacred, ceremony, the, hieros, gamos, indicates, a, ritual, of, fertility, magic, which, was, probably, introduced, from, near, east, in, the, aegean, region, the, hieros, gamos, of, zeus, with, the, earth, goddess, finally, named, hera, was, celebrated, at, knossos, in, crete, in, near, east, the, solar, deity, and, the, moon, goddess, are, oftenly, represented, as, a, bull, and, a, cow, and, roscher, proposed, that, hera, was, a, moon, goddess, the, combination, feminine, divinity, cow, moon, is, not, unusual, in, crete, and, near, east, the, relationship, of, hera, with, the, cow, still, existed, in, the, historical, times, and, this, propably, relates, her, to, near, eastern, forms, of, cow, goddesses, like, hathor, or, bat, the, egyptian, sky, goddess, hathor, is, the, consort, of, the, sky, god, horus, in, the, vedic, tradition, the, earth, goddess, prithvi, is, the, consort, of, the, sky, god, dyaus, and, she, is, associated, with, the, cow, prithvi, may, be, identified, with, the, greek, goddess, gaia, pherecydes, of, syros, in, his, cosmogony, describes, the, mating, of, two, divine, principles, the, marriage, of, zas, with, chthonie, geoffrey, kirk, notices, that, after, the, marriage, cthonie, becomes, ge, who, probably, takes, charge, of, the, protection, of, marriage, hera, is, occasionally, identified, with, ge, in, a, fragment, of, euripides, the, aether, of, zeus, is, the, sky, god, who, is, the, father, of, men, and, gods, and, the, earth, goddess, ge, is, the, mother, of, all, life, it, seems, that, io, the, priestess, of, hera, at, argos, and, consort, of, zeus, was, another, form, of, hera, in, a, greek, myth, io, is, transformed, into, a, cow, the, worship, of, hera, was, sparse, in, thessaly, attica, phocis, and, achaea, in, boeotia, she, is, related, to, the, fest, daedala, the, main, center, of, her, cult, was, north, eastern, peloponnese, especially, argolis, argos, tiryns, corinth, sicyon, epidaurus, and, hermione, she, was, worshipped, at, the, arcadian, cities, mantineia, megalopolis, stymphalus, and, at, sparta, the, oldest, temple, at, olympia, belonged, to, hera, in, the, islands, she, was, worshipped, at, samos, paros, delos, amorgos, thera, kos, rhodes, and, crete, the, island, euboea, was, considered, her, holy, place, a, month, was, named, after, hera, at, delphi, heraios, olous, laconia, tinos, herai, n, pergamos, heraos, hera, is, the, olympia, queen, anassa, the, queen, of, heaven, the, royal, quality, of, her, was, preserved, by, the, monuments, of, greek, art, hera, may, have, been, the, first, deity, to, whom, the, greeks, dedicated, an, enclosed, roofed, temple, sanctuary, at, samos, about, 800, bce, it, was, replaced, later, by, the, heraion, of, samos, one, of, the, largest, of, all, greek, temples, altars, were, in, front, of, the, temples, under, the, open, sky, there, were, many, temples, built, on, this, site, so, the, evidence, is, somewhat, confusing, and, archaeological, dates, are, uncertain, the, temple, created, by, the, rhoecus, sculptors, and, architects, was, destroyed, between, 570, and, 560, bce, this, was, replaced, by, the, polycratean, temple, of, 540, 530, bce, in, one, of, these, temples, we, see, a, forest, of, 155, columns, there, is, also, no, evidence, of, tiles, on, this, temple, suggesting, either, the, temple, was, never, finished, or, that, the, temple, was, open, to, the, sky, earlier, sanctuaries, whose, dedication, to, hera, is, less, certain, were, of, the, mycenaean, type, called, house, sanctuaries, samos, excavations, have, revealed, votive, offerings, many, of, them, late, 8th, and, 7th, centuries, bce, which, show, that, hera, at, samos, was, not, merely, a, local, greek, goddess, of, the, aegean, the, museum, there, contains, figures, of, gods, and, suppliants, and, other, votive, offerings, from, armenia, babylon, iran, assyria, and, egypt, testimony, to, the, reputation, which, this, sanctuary, of, hera, enjoyed, and, the, large, influx, of, pilgrims, compared, to, this, mighty, goddess, who, also, possessed, the, earliest, temple, at, olympia, and, two, of, the, great, fifth, and, sixth, century, temples, of, paestum, the, termagant, of, homer, and, the, myths, is, an, almost, comic, figure, according, to, burkert, though, the, greatest, and, earliest, free, standing, temple, to, hera, was, the, heraion, of, samos, in, the, greek, mainland, hera, was, especially, worshipped, as, argive, hera, hera, argeia, at, her, sanctuary, that, stood, between, the, former, mycenaean, city, states, of, argos, and, mycenae, where, the, festivals, in, her, honor, called, heraia, were, celebrated, the, three, cities, i, love, best, she, declares, in, the, iliad, book, iv, are, argos, sparta, and, mycenae, of, the, broad, streets, there, were, also, temples, to, hera, in, olympia, corinth, tiryns, perachora, and, the, sacred, island, of, delos, in, magna, graecia, two, doric, temples, to, hera, were, constructed, at, paestum, about, 550, bce, and, about, 450, bce, one, of, them, long, called, the, temple, of, poseidon, was, identified, in, the, 1950s, as, a, temple, of, hera, the, daedala, fire, festival, on, cithaeron, near, plataea, included, an, account, of, hera, s, quarrel, with, zeus, and, their, reconciliation, hera, s, importance, in, the, early, archaic, period, is, attested, by, the, large, building, projects, undertaken, in, her, honor, the, temples, of, hera, in, the, two, main, centers, of, her, cult, the, heraion, of, samos, and, the, heraion, of, argos, in, the, argolis, were, the, very, earliest, monumental, greek, temples, constructed, in, the, 8th, century, bce, at, argos, the, dorian, heraion, was, built, on, the, hill, of, prosymna, near, mycenean, hero, tombs, at, samos, the, cult, activity, near, the, altar, begun, in, late, mycenean, period, and, a, big, altar, was, built, in, the, 9th, century, bc, according, to, walter, burkert, both, hera, and, demeter, have, many, characteristic, attributes, of, pre, greek, great, goddesses, in, the, same, vein, british, scholar, charles, francis, keary, suggests, that, hera, had, some, sort, of, earth, goddess, worship, in, ancient, times, connected, to, her, possible, origin, as, a, pelasgian, goddess, as, mentioned, by, herodotus, in, greece, the, mediterranean, goddess, of, nature, is, the, bride, of, the, greek, sky, god, in, her, fest, daedala, hera, is, related, to, the, nymph, plataia, consort, of, zeus, an, old, forgotten, form, of, the, greek, earth, goddess, plataia, may, be, related, to, gaia, who, is, occasionally, identified, with, hera, according, to, homeric, hymn, ii, to, delian, apollo, hera, detained, eileithyia, to, prevent, leto, from, going, into, labor, with, artemis, and, apollo, since, the, father, was, zeus, the, other, goddesses, present, at, the, birthing, on, delos, sent, iris, to, bring, her, as, she, stepped, upon, the, island, the, divine, birth, began, in, the, myth, of, the, birth, of, heracles, it, is, hera, herself, who, sits, at, the, door, delaying, the, birth, of, heracles, until, her, prot, g, eurystheus, had, been, born, first, the, homeric, hymn, to, pythian, apollo, makes, the, monster, typhaon, the, offspring, of, archaic, hera, in, her, ancient, form, produced, out, of, herself, like, a, monstrous, version, of, hephaestus, and, whelped, in, a, cave, in, cilicia, she, gave, the, creature, to, python, to, raise, in, the, temple, of, hera, olympia, hera, s, seated, cult, figure, was, older, than, the, warrior, figure, of, zeus, that, accompanied, it, homer, expressed, her, relationship, with, zeus, delicately, in, the, iliad, in, which, she, declares, to, zeus, i, am, cronus, eldest, daughter, and, am, honourable, not, on, this, ground, only, but, also, because, i, am, your, wife, and, you, are, king, of, the, gods, there, has, been, considerable, scholarship, reaching, back, to, johann, jakob, bachofen, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, about, the, possibility, that, hera, whose, early, importance, in, greek, religion, is, firmly, established, was, originally, the, goddess, of, a, matriarchal, people, presumably, inhabiting, greece, before, the, hellenes, in, this, view, her, activity, as, goddess, of, marriage, established, the, patriarchal, bond, of, her, own, subordination, her, resistance, to, the, conquests, of, zeus, is, rendered, as, hera, s, jealousy, the, main, theme, of, literary, anecdotes, that, undercut, her, ancient, cult, however, it, remains, a, controversial, claim, that, an, ancient, matriarchy, or, a, cultural, focus, on, a, monotheistic, great, goddess, existed, among, the, ancient, greeks, or, elsewhere, the, claim, is, generally, rejected, by, modern, scholars, as, insufficiently, evidenced, walter, burkert, notices, that, the, ancient, kourotrophos, figure, is, almost, absent, in, crete, and, the, nomination, mother, goddess, was, not, the, underlying, principle, in, the, minoan, religion, hera, was, most, known, as, the, matron, goddess, hera, teleia, but, she, presided, over, weddings, as, well, in, myth, and, cult, fragmentary, references, and, archaic, practices, remain, of, the, sacred, marriage, of, hera, and, zeus, at, plataea, there, was, a, sculpture, of, hera, seated, as, a, bride, by, callimachus, as, well, as, the, matronly, standing, hera, hera, was, also, worshipped, as, a, virgin, there, was, a, tradition, in, stymphalia, in, arcadia, that, there, had, been, a, triple, shrine, to, hera, the, girl, the, adult, woman, and, the, separated, widowed, or, divorced, in, the, region, around, argos, the, temple, of, hera, in, hermione, near, argos, was, to, hera, the, virgin, at, the, spring, of, kanathos, close, to, nauplia, hera, renewed, her, virginity, annually, in, rites, that, were, not, to, be, spoken, of, arrheton, in, her, fire, festival, daedala, at, plataia, the, puppet, of, the, goddess, was, bathed, in, the, river, asopos, before, the, wedding, ceremony, in, the, festival, toneia, at, samos, the, image, of, the, goddess, was, purified, bounted, in, willows, and, then, probably, hanged, on, a, tree, robert, graves, interprets, this, as, a, representation, of, the, new, moon, hebe, full, moon, hera, and, old, moon, hecate, respectively, personifying, the, virgin, spring, the, mother, summer, and, the, destroying, crone, autumn, the, marriage, of, zeus, with, hera, is, the, main, theme, in, most, greek, festivals, celebrated, in, honour, of, the, goddess, in, the, cults, of, hera, the, dances, and, rites, are, performed, by, young, married, women, these, choral, dances, reenacted, early, myth, and, ritual, burkert, notices, that, the, disappearing, and, retrieval, of, hera, in, some, cults, has, parallels, with, other, fertility, cults, the, greek, aetiological, myths, aitia, give, a, reasonable, explanation, of, the, ritual, and, replicate, its, structural, form, this, is, accurate, for, aitia, related, to, initiation, rituals, from, youth, to, maturity, ancient, accounts, refer, to, the, retirement, of, hera, after, a, quarell, with, zeus, hera, s, wrath, may, indicate, the, wrath, and, jealousy, of, the, greek, wife, other, accounts, refer, to, cultic, trees, or, pillars, and, rituals, of, the, goddess, of, vegetation, some, accounts, are, related, to, rituals, of, the, bronze, age, before, the, splitting, of, the, mistress, of, the, animals, into, separate, goddesses, in, hellenistic, imagery, hera, s, chariot, was, pulled, by, peacocks, birds, not, known, to, greeks, before, the, conquests, of, alexander, alexander, s, tutor, aristotle, refers, to, it, as, the, persian, bird, the, peacock, motif, was, revived, in, the, renaissance, iconography, that, unified, hera, and, juno, a, bird, that, had, been, associated, with, hera, on, an, archaic, level, when, most, of, the, aegean, goddesses, were, associated, with, their, bird, was, the, cuckoo, which, appears, in, mythic, fragments, concerning, the, first, wooing, of, a, virginal, hera, by, zeus, her, archaic, association, was, primarily, with, cattle, as, a, cow, goddess, who, was, especially, venerated, in, cattle, rich, euboea, on, cyprus, very, early, archaeological, sites, contain, bull, skulls, that, have, been, adapted, for, use, as, masks, see, bull, mythology, her, familiar, homeric, epithet, bo, pis, is, always, translated, cow, eyed, in, this, respect, hera, bears, some, resemblance, to, the, ancient, egyptian, deity, hathor, a, maternal, goddess, associated, with, cattle, hera, absorbed, the, cult, of, her, heifer, priestess, io, and, may, be, related, to, the, vedic, earth, goddess, prithvi, scholar, of, greek, mythology, walter, burkert, writes, in, greek, religion, nevertheless, there, are, memories, of, an, earlier, aniconic, representation, as, a, pillar, in, argos, and, as, a, plank, in, samos, at, argos, in, a, greek, myth, the, priestess, of, hera, phoronis, ties, her, mistress, to, an, aniconic, pillar, at, samos, hera, s, plank, was, tied, on, a, willow, tree, to, ensure, fertility, hera, is, the, daughter, of, the, titans, cronus, and, rhea, and, the, sibling, of, hestia, demeter, hades, poseidon, and, zeus, cronus, was, fated, to, be, overthrown, by, one, of, his, children, to, prevent, this, he, swallowed, all, of, his, newborn, children, whole, until, rhea, tricked, him, into, swallowing, a, stone, instead, of, her, youngest, child, zeus, zeus, grew, up, in, secret, and, when, he, grew, up, he, tricked, his, father, into, regurgitating, his, siblings, including, hera, zeus, then, led, the, revolt, against, the, titans, banished, them, and, divided, the, dominion, over, the, world, with, his, brothers, poseidon, and, hades, other, traditions, however, appear, to, give, hera, different, upbringings, pausanias, states, that, she, was, nursed, as, an, infant, by, the, three, daughters, of, the, river, asterion, euboia, prosymna, and, akraia, furthermore, in, the, iliad, hera, states, she, was, given, by, her, mother, to, tethys, to, be, raised, i, go, now, to, the, ends, of, the, generous, earth, on, a, visit, to, the, ocean, whence, the, gods, have, risen, and, tethys, our, mother, who, brought, me, up, kindly, in, their, own, house, and, cared, for, me, and, took, me, from, rheia, at, that, time, when, zeus, of, the, wide, brows, drove, kronos, underneath, the, earth, and, the, barren, water, hera, is, the, goddess, of, marriage, and, childbirth, rather, than, motherhood, and, much, of, her, mythology, revolves, around, her, marriage, with, her, brother, zeus, she, is, charmed, by, him, and, she, seduces, him, he, cheats, on, her, and, has, many, children, with, other, goddesses, and, mortal, women, she, is, intensely, jealous, and, vindictive, towards, his, children, and, their, mothers, he, is, threatening, and, violent, to, her, in, the, iliad, zeus, implies, their, marriage, was, some, sort, of, elopement, as, they, lay, secretly, from, their, parents, pausanias, records, a, tale, of, how, they, came, to, be, married, in, which, zeus, transformed, into, a, cuckoo, to, woo, hera, she, caught, the, bird, and, kept, it, as, her, pet, this, is, why, the, cuckoo, is, seated, on, her, sceptre, according, to, a, scholion, on, theocritus, idylls, when, hera, was, heading, toward, mount, thornax, alone, zeus, created, a, terrible, storm, and, transformed, himself, into, a, cuckoo, who, flew, down, and, sat, on, her, lap, hera, covered, him, with, her, cloak, zeus, then, transformed, back, and, took, hold, of, her, because, she, was, refusing, to, sleep, with, him, due, to, their, mother, he, promised, to, marry, her, in, one, account, hera, refused, to, marry, zeus, and, hid, in, a, cave, to, avoid, him, an, earthborn, man, named, achilles, convinced, her, to, give, him, a, chance, and, thus, the, two, had, their, first, sexual, intercourse, according, to, a, version, attributed, to, plutarch, hera, had, been, reared, by, a, nymph, named, macris, on, the, island, of, euboea, but, zeus, stole, her, away, where, mt, cithaeron, afforded, them, a, shady, recess, when, macris, came, to, look, for, her, ward, the, mountain, god, cithaeron, drove, her, away, saying, that, zeus, was, taking, his, pleasure, there, with, leto, according, to, callimachus, their, wedding, feast, lasted, three, hundred, years, the, apples, of, the, hesperides, that, heracles, was, tasked, by, eurystheus, to, take, were, a, wedding, gift, by, gaia, to, the, couple, after, a, quarrel, with, zeus, hera, left, him, and, retreated, to, euboea, and, no, word, from, zeus, managed, to, sway, her, mind, cithaeron, the, local, king, then, advised, zeus, to, take, a, wooden, statue, of, a, woman, wrap, it, up, and, pretend, to, marry, it, zeus, did, as, told, claiming, she, was, plataea, asopus, s, daughter, hera, once, she, heard, the, news, disrupted, the, wedding, ceremony, and, tore, away, the, dress, from, the, figure, only, to, discover, it, was, but, a, lifeless, statue, and, not, a, rival, in, love, the, queen, and, her, king, were, reconciled, and, to, commemorate, this, the, people, there, celebrated, a, festival, called, daedala, during, the, festival, a, re, enactment, of, the, myth, was, celebrated, where, a, wooden, statue, of, hera, was, chosen, bathed, in, the, river, asopus, and, then, raised, on, a, chariot, to, lead, the, procession, like, a, bride, and, then, ritually, burned, according, to, diodorus, siculus, alcmene, the, mother, of, heracles, was, the, very, last, mortal, woman, zeus, ever, slept, with, following, the, birth, of, heracles, he, ceased, to, beget, humans, altogether, hera, is, the, stepmother, and, enemy, of, heracles, the, name, heracles, means, glory, of, hera, in, homer, s, iliad, when, alcmene, was, about, to, give, birth, to, heracles, zeus, announced, to, all, the, gods, that, on, that, day, a, child, by, zeus, himself, would, be, born, and, rule, all, those, around, him, hera, after, requesting, zeus, to, swear, an, oath, to, that, effect, descended, from, olympus, to, argos, and, made, the, wife, of, sthenelus, son, of, perseus, give, birth, to, eurystheus, after, only, seven, months, while, at, the, same, time, preventing, alcmene, from, delivering, heracles, this, resulted, in, the, fulfillment, of, zeus, s, oath, in, that, it, was, eurystheus, rather, than, heracles, in, pausanias, recounting, hera, sent, witches, as, they, were, called, by, the, thebans, to, hinder, alcmene, s, delivery, of, heracles, the, witches, were, successful, in, preventing, the, birth, until, historis, daughter, of, tiresias, thought, of, a, trick, to, deceive, the, witches, like, galanthis, historis, announced, that, alcmene, had, delivered, her, child, having, been, deceived, the, witches, went, away, allowing, alcmene, to, give, birth, hera, s, wrath, against, zeus, s, son, continued, and, while, heracles, was, still, an, infant, hera, sent, two, serpents, to, kill, him, as, he, lay, in, his, cot, heracles, throttled, the, snakes, with, his, bare, hands, and, was, found, by, his, nurse, playing, with, their, limp, bodies, as, if, they, were, a, child, s, toys, one, account, of, the, origin, of, the, milky, way, is, that, zeus, had, tricked, hera, into, nursing, the, infant, heracles, discovering, who, he, was, she, pulled, him, from, her, breast, and, a, spurt, of, her, milk, formed, the, smear, across, the, sky, that, can, be, seen, to, this, day, her, milk, also, created, a, white, flower, the, lily, unlike, any, greeks, the, etruscans, instead, pictured, a, full, grown, bearded, heracles, at, hera, s, breast, a, reference, to, his, adoption, by, her, when, he, became, an, immortal, he, had, previously, wounded, her, severely, in, the, breast, when, heracles, reached, adulthood, hera, drove, him, mad, which, led, him, to, murder, his, family, and, this, later, led, to, him, undertaking, his, famous, labours, hera, assigned, heracles, to, labour, for, king, eurystheus, at, mycenae, she, attempted, to, make, almost, all, of, heracles, s, twelve, labours, more, difficult, when, he, fought, the, lernaean, hydra, she, sent, a, crab, to, bite, at, his, feet, in, the, hopes, of, distracting, him, later, hera, stirred, up, the, amazons, against, him, when, he, was, on, one, of, his, quests, when, heracles, took, the, cattle, of, geryon, he, shot, hera, in, the, right, breast, with, a, triple, barbed, arrow, the, wound, was, incurable, and, left, her, in, constant, pain, as, dione, tells, aphrodite, in, the, iliad, book, v, afterwards, hera, sent, a, gadfly, to, bite, the, cattle, irritate, them, and, scatter, them, hera, then, sent, a, flood, which, raised, the, water, level, of, a, river, so, much, that, heracles, could, not, ford, the, river, with, the, cattle, he, piled, stones, into, the, river, to, make, the, water, shallower, when, he, finally, reached, the, court, of, eurystheus, the, cattle, were, sacrificed, to, hera, eurystheus, also, wanted, to, sacrifice, the, cretan, bull, to, hera, she, refused, the, sacrifice, because, it, reflected, glory, on, heracles, the, bull, was, released, and, wandered, to, marathon, becoming, known, as, the, marathonian, bull, some, myths, state, that, in, the, end, heracles, befriended, hera, by, saving, her, from, porphyrion, a, giant, who, tried, to, rape, her, during, the, gigantomachy, and, that, she, even, gave, her, daughter, hebe, as, his, bride, whatever, myth, making, served, to, account, for, an, archaic, representation, of, heracles, as, hera, s, man, it, was, thought, suitable, for, the, builders, of, the, heraion, at, paestum, to, depict, the, exploits, of, heracles, in, bas, relief, when, hera, discovered, that, leto, was, pregnant, and, that, zeus, was, the, father, she, convinced, the, nature, spirits, to, prevent, leto, from, giving, birth, on, terra, firma, the, mainland, any, island, at, sea, or, any, place, under, the, sun, poseidon, gave, pity, to, leto, and, guided, her, to, the, floating, island, of, delos, which, was, neither, mainland, nor, a, real, island, where, leto, was, able, to, give, birth, to, her, children, afterwards, zeus, secured, delos, to, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, the, island, later, became, sacred, to, apollo, alternatively, hera, kidnapped, eileithyia, the, goddess, of, childbirth, to, prevent, leto, from, going, into, labor, the, other, gods, bribed, hera, with, a, beautiful, necklace, nobody, could, resist, and, she, finally, gave, in, either, way, artemis, was, born, first, and, then, assisted, with, the, birth, of, apollo, some, versions, say, artemis, helped, her, mother, give, birth, to, apollo, for, nine, days, another, variation, states, that, artemis, was, born, one, day, before, apollo, on, the, island, of, ortygia, and, that, she, helped, leto, cross, the, sea, to, delos, the, next, day, to, give, birth, to, apollo, later, tityos, attempted, to, rape, leto, at, the, behest, of, hera, he, was, slain, by, artemis, and, apollo, this, account, of, the, birth, of, apollo, and, artemis, is, contradicted, by, hesiod, in, theogony, as, the, twins, are, born, prior, to, zeus, s, marriage, to, hera, the, myth, of, io, has, many, forms, and, embellishments, generally, io, was, a, priestess, of, hera, at, the, heraion, of, argos, zeus, lusted, after, her, and, either, hera, turned, io, into, a, heifer, to, hide, her, from, zeus, or, zeus, did, so, to, hide, her, from, hera, but, was, discovered, hera, had, io, tethered, to, an, olive, tree, and, set, argus, panoptes, lit, all, seeing, to, watch, over, her, but, zeus, sent, hermes, to, kill, him, infuriated, hera, then, sent, a, gadfly, greek, oistros, compare, oestrus, to, pursue, and, constantly, sting, io, who, fled, into, asia, and, eventually, reached, egypt, there, zeus, restored, her, to, human, form, and, she, gave, birth, to, his, son, epaphus, a, prophecy, stated, that, a, son, of, the, sea, nymph, thetis, with, whom, zeus, fell, in, love, after, gazing, upon, her, in, the, oceans, off, the, greek, coast, would, become, greater, than, his, father, possibly, for, this, reason, thetis, was, betrothed, to, an, elderly, human, king, peleus, son, of, aeacus, either, upon, zeus, s, orders, or, because, she, wished, to, please, hera, who, had, raised, her, all, the, gods, and, goddesses, as, well, as, various, mortals, were, invited, to, the, marriage, of, peleus, and, thetis, the, eventual, parents, of, achilles, and, brought, many, gifts, only, eris, goddess, of, discord, was, not, invited, and, was, stopped, at, the, door, by, hermes, on, zeus, s, order, she, was, annoyed, at, this, so, she, threw, from, the, door, a, gift, of, her, own, a, golden, apple, inscribed, with, the, word, kallist, i, to, the, fairest, aphrodite, hera, and, athena, all, claimed, to, be, the, fairest, and, thus, the, rightful, owner, of, the, apple, the, goddesses, quarreled, bitterly, over, it, and, none, of, the, other, gods, would, venture, an, opinion, favoring, one, for, fear, of, earning, the, enmity, of, the, other, two, they, chose, to, place, the, matter, before, zeus, who, not, wanting, to, favor, one, of, the, goddesses, put, the, choice, into, the, hands, of, paris, a, trojan, prince, after, bathing, in, the, spring, of, mount, ida, where, troy, was, situated, they, appeared, before, paris, to, have, him, choose, the, goddesses, undressed, before, him, either, at, his, request, or, for, the, sake, of, winning, still, paris, could, not, decide, as, all, three, were, ideally, beautiful, so, they, resorted, to, bribes, hera, offered, paris, political, power, and, control, of, all, of, asia, while, athena, offered, wisdom, fame, and, glory, in, battle, and, aphrodite, offered, the, most, beautiful, mortal, woman, in, the, world, as, a, wife, and, he, accordingly, chose, her, this, woman, was, helen, who, was, unfortunately, for, paris, already, married, to, king, menelaus, of, sparta, the, other, two, goddesses, were, enraged, by, this, and, through, helen, s, abduction, by, paris, they, brought, about, the, trojan, war, hera, plays, a, substantial, role, in, the, iliad, appearing, in, several, books, throughout, the, epic, poem, she, hates, the, trojans, because, of, paris, s, decision, that, aphrodite, was, the, most, beautiful, goddess, and, so, supports, the, greeks, during, the, war, throughout, the, epic, hera, makes, many, attempts, to, thwart, the, trojan, army, in, books, 1, and, 2, hera, declares, that, the, trojans, must, be, destroyed, hera,

he, bellowed, in, pain, and, fled, to, mount, olympus, forcing, the, trojans, to, fall, back, in, book, 8, hera, tries, to, persuade, poseidon, to, disobey, zeus, and, help, the, achaean, army, he, refuses, saying, he, doesn, t, want, to, go, against, zeus, determined, to, intervene, in, the, war, hera, and, athena, head, to, the, battlefield, however, seeing, the, two, flee, zeus, sent, iris, to, intercept, them, and, make, them, return, to, mount, olympus, or, face, grave, consequences, after, prolonged, fighting, hera, sees, poseidon, aiding, the, greeks, and, giving, them, the,

the, side, of, the, achaeans, so, she, plans, a, deception, of, zeus, where, she, seduces, him, with, help, from, aphrodite, and, tricks, him, into, a, deep, sleep, with, the, help, of, hypnos, so, that, the, gods, could, interfere, without, the, fear, of, zeus, in, book, 21, hera, continues, her, interference, with, the, battle, as, she, tells, hephaestus, to, prevent, the, river, from, harming, achilles, hephaestus, sets, the, battlefield, ablaze, causing, the, river, to, plead, with, hera, promising, her, he, will, not, help, the, trojans, if, hephaestus, stops, his, attack, hephaestus, stops, his, assault, and, hera, returns, to, the, battlefield, where, the, gods, begin, to, fight, amongst, themselves, after, apollo, declines, to, battle, poseidon, artemis, eagerly, engages, hera, for, a, duel, hera, however, treats, the, challenge, as, unimportant, easily, disarming, the, haughty, rival, goddess, and, beating, her, with, her, own, weapons, artemis, is, left, retreating, back, to, mount, olympus, in, tears, to, cry, at, zeus, s, lap, when, hera, learned, that, semele, daughter, of, cadmus, king, of, thebes, was, pregnant, by, zeus, she, disguised, herself, as, semele, s, nurse, and, persuaded, the, princess, to, insist, that, zeus, show, himself, to, her, in, his, true, form, when, he, was, compelled, to, do, so, having, sworn, by, styx, his, thunder,
