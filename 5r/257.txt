sikh, lit, disciple, which, connotes, the, temporal, path, of, learning, and, is, rooted, in, the, verb, sikhana, lit, to, learn, some, sikhs, oppose, the, exonym, term, sikhism, as, they, claim, the, word, was, coined, by, the, british, colonists, rather, than, by, sikhs, themselves, and, they, instead, prefer, the, endonym, sikhi, they, argue, that, an, ism, connotes, a, fixed, and, immutable, worldview, which, is, not, congruent, with, the, internally, fluid, nature, of, the, sikh, philosophy, the, basis, of, sikhism, lies, in, the, teachings, of, guru, nanak, and, his, successors, sikh,

is, simultaneously, within, everything, and, is, all, encompassing, the, oneness, of, god, is, reflected, by, the, phrase, ik, onkar, in, sikhism, the, word, for, god, is, waheguru, lit, wondrous, teacher, the, waheguru, is, considered, to, be, nirankar, shapeless, akal, timeless, karta, purakh, the, creator, being, akaal, purkh, beyond, time, and, death, and, agam, agochar, incomprehensible, and, invisible, in, a, literal, sense, god, has, no, gender, in, sikhism, but, metaphorically, god, is, presented, as, masculine, and, god, s, power, as, feminine, for, example, guru, gobind, singh, refers, to, god, as, his, father, and, god, s, creative, power, as, his, mother, similarly, another, example, is, that, the, guru, granth, sahib, the, primary, sikh, scripture, says, that, all, humans, are, soul, brides, who, long, to, unite, with, their, husband, lord, in, addition, the, gurus, also, wrote, in, the, guru, granth, sahib, that, there, are, many, worlds, on, which, the, transcendental, god, has, created, life, the, sikh, scripture, begins, with, god, as, ik, onkar, the, one, creator, 227, understood, in, the, sikh, tradition, as, monotheistic, unity, of, god, ik, onkar, sometimes, capitalized, is, more, loosely, rendered, the, one, supreme, reality, the, one, creator, the, all, pervading, spirit, and, other, ways, of, expressing, a, diffused, but, unified, and, singular, sense, of, god, and, creation, the, traditional, mul, mantar, goes, from, ik, onkar, until, nanak, hosee, bhee, sach, the, opening, line, of, the, guru, granth, sahib, and, each,

enmity, immortal, never, incarnated, self, existent, known, by, grace, through, the, true, guru, m, y, defined, as, a, temporary, illusion, or, unreality, is, one, of, the, core, deviations, from, the, pursuit, of, god, and, salvation, where, worldly, attractions, give, only, illusory, temporary, satisfaction, and, pain, that, distracts, from, the, process, of, the, devotion, of, god, however, nanak, emphasized, m, y, as, not, a, reference, to, the, unreality, of, the, world, but, of, its, values, in, sikhism, the, influences, of, ego, anger, greed, attachment, and, lust, known, as, the, p, nj, chor, five, thieves, are, believed, to, be, particularly, distracting, and, hurtful, sikhs, believe, the, world, is, currently, in, a, state, of, kali, yuga, age, of, darkness, because, the, world, is, led, astray, by, the, love, of, and, attachment, to, m, y, the, fate, of, people, vulnerable, to, the, five, thieves, is, separation, from, god, and, the, situation, may, be, remedied, only, after, intensive, and, relentless, devotion, according, to, guru, nanak, the, supreme, purpose, of, human, life, is, to, reconnect, with, akal, the, timeless, one, however, egotism, is, the, biggest, barrier, in, making, this, connection, using, the, guru, s, teaching, remembrance, of, n, m, the, divine, name, of, the, lord, leads, to, the, end, of, egotism, guru, nanak, designated, the, word, guru, teacher, to, mean, the, voice, of, the, spirit, the, source, of, knowledge, and, the, guide, to, salvation, as, ik, onkar, is, universally, immanent, guru, is, indistinguishable, from, akal, and, are, one, and, the, same, one, connects, with, guru, only, with, accumulation, of, selfless, search, of, truth, ultimately, the, seeker, realises, that, it, is, the, consciousness, within, the, body, which, is, the, seeker, follower, of, the, word, that, is, the, true, guru, the, human, body, is, just, a, means, to, achieve, the, reunion, with, truth, once, truth, starts, to, shine, in, a, person, s, heart, the, essence, of, current, and, past, holy, books, of, all, religions, is, understood, by, the, person, guru, nanak, s, teachings, are, founded, not, on, a, final, destination, of, heaven, or, hell, but, on, a, spiritual, union, with, the, akal, which, results, in, salvation, or, jivanmukti, enlightenment, liberation, within, one, s, lifetime, a, concept, also, found, in, hinduism, guru, gobind, singh, makes, it, clear, that, human, birth, is, obtained, with, great, fortune, and, therefore, one, needs, to, be, able, to, make, the, most, of, this, life, sikhs, accept, reincarnation, and, karma, concepts, found, in, buddhism, hinduism, and, jainism, but, do, not, necessarily, infer, a, metaphysical, soteriology, such, as, a, state, of, heaven, or, nirvana, nevertheless, in, sikhism, both, karma, and, liberation, are, modified, by, the, concept, of, god, s, grace, nadar, mehar, kirpa, karam, etc, guru, nanak, states, that, the, body, takes, birth, because, of, karma, but, salvation, is, attained, through, grace, to, get, closer, to, god, sikhs, avoid, the, evils, of, maya, keep, the, everlasting, truth, in, mind, practice, shabad, kirtan, musical, recitation, of, hymns, meditate, on, naam, and, serve, humanity, sikhs, believe, that, being, in, the, company, of, the, satsang, association, with, sat, true, people, or, sadh, sangat, is, one, of, the, key, ways, to, achieve, liberation, from, the, cycles, of, reincarnation, the, sikh, community, may, be, seen, to, correspond, to, a, d, smith, s, definition, of, a, politicized, community, sharing, common, ancestry, myths, and, historical, memories, of, martyrdom, and, persecution, under, successive, rulers, miri, piri, is, a, doctrine, that, has, been, practiced, in, sikh, religion, since, the, seventeenth, century, the, doctrine, of, the, mir, social, and, political, aspects, of, life, and, the, pir, guides, to, spiritual, aspect, of, life, was, revealed, by, the, first, guru, of, sikhism, guru, nanak, but, propounded, by, the, sixth, guru, of, sikhism, guru, hargobind, on, 12, june, 1606, after, the, martyrdom, of, his, father, guru, hargobind, was, elevated, to, the, guruship, and, fulfilled, the, prophecy, that, was, given, by, the, primal, figure, of, sikh, baba, buddha, that, the, guru, will, possess, spiritual, and, temporal, power, guru, hargobind, introduced, the, two, swords, of, miri, and, piri, symbolizing, both, worldly, social, and, political, and, spiritual, authority, the, two, kirpan, of, miri, and, piri, are, tied, together, with, a, khanda, in, center, so, the, combination, of, both, is, considered, supreme, this, means, that, all, action, informed, or, arising, out, of, the, spiritual, heart, completes, one, s, purpose, and, meaning, in, the, world, of, action, spirituality, guru, nanak, the, first, sikh, guru, and, the, founder, of, sikhism, was, a, bhakti, saint, he, taught, that, the, most, important, form, of, worship, is, bhakti, devotion, to, waheguru, guru, arjan, in, the, sukhmani, sahib, recommended, the, true, religion, as, one, of, loving, devotion, to, god, the, guru, granth, sahib, includes, suggestions, on, how, a, sikh, should, perform, constant, bhakti, some, scholars, call, sikhism, a, bhakti, sect, of, indian, traditions, adding, that, it, emphasises, nirguni, bhakti, i, e, loving, devotion, to, a, divine, without, qualities, or, physical, form, 1, 3, while, western, scholarship, generally, places, sikhism, as, arising, primarily, within, a, hindu, bhakti, movement, milieu, while, recognizing, some, sufi, islamic, influences, 3, 42, 3, some, indian, sikh, scholars, disagree, and, state, that, sikhism, transcended, the, environment, it, emerged, from, the, basis, of, the, latter, analysis, is, that, bhakti, traditions, did, not, clearly, disassociate, from, vedic, texts, and, their, cosmologies, and, metaphysical, worldview, while, the, sikh, tradition, clearly, did, disassociate, from, the, vedic, tradition, some, sikh, sects, outside, the, punjab, region, of, india, such, as, those, found, in, maharashtra, and, bihar, practice, aarti, the, ceremonial, use, of, lamps, during, bhakti, observances, in, a, sikh, gurdwara, however, most, sikh, gurdwaras, forbid, aarti, during, their, bhakti, practices, 201, while, emphasizing, bhakti, the, sikh, gurus, also, taught, that, the, spiritual, life, and, secular, householder, life, are, intertwined, and, not, separate, this, logically, follows, from, the, panentheistic, nature, of, sikh, philosophy, in, sikh, worldview, the, everyday, world, is, part, of, the, infinite, reality, increased, spiritual, awareness, leads, to, increased, and, vibrant, participation, in, the, everyday, world, guru, nanak, described, living, an, active, creative, and, practical, life, of, truthfulness, fidelity, self, control, and, purity, as, being, higher, than, the, metaphysical, truth, the, sixth, guru, guru, hargobind, after, guru, arjan, s, martyrdom, faced, with, oppression, by, the, islamic, mughal, empire, affirmed, the, philosophy, that, the, political, temporal, miri, and, spiritual, piri, realms, are, mutually, coexistent, according, to, the, ninth, sikh, guru, tegh, bahadur, the, ideal, sikh, should, have, both, shakti, power, that, resides, in, the, temporal, and, bhakti, spiritual, meditative, qualities, this, was, developed, into, the, concept, of, the, saint, soldier, by, the, tenth, sikh, guru, gobind, singh, the, concept, of, humanity, as, elaborated, by, guru, nanak, refines, and, negates, the, monotheistic, concept, of, self, god, declaring, that, monotheism, becomes, almost, redundant, in, the, movement, and, crossings, of, love, sikh, gurus, have, taught, that, the, human, s, goal, is, to, end, all, dualities, of, self, and, other, i, and, not, i, attain, the, attendant, balance, of, separation, fusion, self, other, action, inaction, attachment, detachment,

sikhism, originated, around, the, 15th, century, guru, nanak, 1469, 1539, the, founder, of, sikhism, was, born, in, the, village, of, r, i, bh, i, d, talwand, now, called, nankana, sahib, in, present, day, pakistan, his, parents, were, punjabi, khatri, hindus, according, to, the, hagiography, puratan, janamsakhi, composed, more, than, two, centuries, after, his, death, and, probably, based, on, oral, tradition, nanak, as, a, boy, was, fascinated, by, religion, and, spiritual, matters, spending, time, with, wandering, ascetics, and, holy, men, his, friend, was, mardana, a, muslim, together, they, would, sing, devotional, songs, all, night, in, front, of, the, public, and, bathe, in, the, river, in, the, morning, one, day, at, the, usual, bath, nanak, went, missing, and, his, family, feared, he, had, drowned, three, days, later, he, returned, home, and, declared, there, is, no, hindu, there, is, no, muslim, n, k, i, hind, n, k, i, musalm, n, thereafter, nanak, started, preaching, his, ideas, that, form, the, tenets, of, sikhism, in, 1526, guru, nanak, at, age, 50, started, a, small, commune, in, kartarpur, and, his, disciples, came, to, be, known, as, sikhs, although, the, exact, account, of, his, itinerary, is, disputed, hagiographic, accounts, state, he, made, five, major, journeys, spanning, thousands, of, miles, the, first, tour, being, east, towards, bengal, and, assam, the, second, south, towards, andhra, and, tamil, nadu, the, third, north, to, kashmir, ladakh, and, mount, sumeru, in, tibet, and, the, fourth, to, baghdad, in, his, last, and, final, tour, he, returned, to, the, banks, of, the, ravi, river, to, end, his, days, there, are, two, competing, theories, on, guru, nanak, s, teachings, one, according, to, cole, and, sambhi, is, based, on, hagiographical, janamsakhis, and, states, that, nanak, s, teachings, and, sikhism, were, a, revelation, from, god, and, not, a, social, protest, movement, nor, any, attempt, to, reconcile, hinduism, and, islam, in, the, 15th, century, the, other, states, that, nanak, was, a, guru, according, to, singha, sikhism, does, not, subscribe, to, the, theory, of, incarnation, or, the, concept, of, prophethood, but, it, has, a, pivotal, concept, of, guru, he, is, not, an, incarnation, of, god, not, even, a, prophet, he, is, an, illumined, soul, the, second, theory, continues, that, hagiographical, janamsakhis, were, not, written, by, nanak, but, by, later, followers, without, regard, for, historical, accuracy, and, contain, numerous, legends, and, myths, created, to, show, respect, for, nanak, the, term, revelation, clarify, cole, and, sambhi, in, sikhism, is, not, limited, to, the, teachings, of, nanak, but, is, extended, to, all, sikh, gurus, as, well, as, the, words, of, past, present, and, future, men, and, women, who, possess, divine, knowledge, intuitively, through, meditation, the, sikh, revelations, include, the, words, of, non, sikh, bhagats, some, who, lived, and, died, before, the, birth, of, nanak, and, whose, teachings, are, part, of, the, sikh, scriptures, the, adi, granth, and, successive, sikh, gurus, repeatedly, emphasised, states, mandair, that, sikhism, is, not, about, hearing, voices, from, god, but, it, is, about, changing, the, nature, of, the, human, mind, and, anyone, can, achieve, direct, experience, and, spiritual, perfection, at, any, time, the, roots, of, the, sikh, tradition, are, states, louis, fenech, perhaps, in, the, sant, tradition, of, india, whose, ideology, grew, to, become, the, bhakti, tradition, furthermore, adds, fenech, few, sikhs, would, mention, these, indic, texts, and, ideologies, in, the, same, breadth, as, the, sikh, tradition, let, alone, trace, elements, of, their, tradition, to, this, chronological, and, ideological, point, despite, the, fact, that, the, indic, mythology, permeates, the, sikh, sacred, canon, the, guru, granth, sahib, and, the, secondary, canon, the, dasam, granth, and, adds, delicate, nuance, and, substance, to, the, sacred, symbolic, universe, of, the, sikhs, of, today, and, of, their, past, ancestors, the, development, of, sikhism, was, influenced, by, the, bhakti, movement, however, sikhism, was, not, simply, an, extension, of, the, bhakti, movement, sikhism, for, instance, disagreed, with, some, of, the, views, of, bhakti, saints, kabir, and, ravidas, sikhism, developed, while, the, region, was, being, ruled, by, the, mughal, empire, two, of, the, sikh, gurus, guru, arjan, and, guru, tegh, bahadur, refused, to, convert, to, islam, and, were, tortured, and, executed, by, the, mughal, rulers, the, islamic, era, persecution, of, sikhs, triggered, the, founding, of, the, khalsa, as, an, order, for, freedom, of, conscience, and, religion, a, sikh, is, expected, to, embody, the, qualities, of, a, sant, sip, h, a, saint, soldier, after, its, inception, sikhism, grew, as, it, gained, converts, among, hindus, and, muslims, in, the, punjab, region, in, 1539, guru, nanak, chose, his, disciple, lahi, as, a, successor, to, the, guruship, rather, than, either, of, his, sons, lahi, was, named, guru, angad, and, became, the, second, guru, of, the, sikhs, nanak, conferred, his, choice, at, the, town, of, kartarpur, on, the, banks, of, the, river, ravi, sri, chand, guru, nanak, s, son, was, also, a, religious, man, and, continued, his, own, commune, of, sikhs, his, followers, came, to, be, known, as, the, udasi, sikhs, the, first, parallel, sect, of, sikhism, that, formed, in, sikh, history, the, udasis, believe, that, the, guruship, should, have, gone, to, sri, chand, since, he, was, a, man, of, pious, habits, in, addition, to, being, nanak, s, son, guru, angad, before, joining, guru, nanak, s, commune, worked, as, a, pujari, priest, and, religious, teacher, centered, around, hindu, goddess, durga, on, nanak, s, advice, guru, angad, moved, from, kartarpur, to, khadur, where, his, wife, khivi, and, children, were, living, until, he, was, able, to, bridge, the, divide, between, his, followers, and, the, udasis, guru, angad, continued, the, work, started, by, guru, nanak, and, is, widely, credited, for, standardising, the, gurmukh, script, as, used, in, the, sacred, scripture, of, the, sikhs, guru, amar, das, became, the, third, sikh, guru, in, 1552, at, the, age, of, 73, he, adhered, to, the, vaishnavism, tradition, of, hinduism, for, much, of, his, life, before, joining, the, commune, of, guru, angad, goindval, became, an, important, centre, for, sikhism, during, the, guruship, of, guru, amar, das, he, was, a, reformer, and, discouraged, veiling, of, women, s, faces, a, muslim, custom, as, well, as, sati, a, hindu, custom, he, encouraged, the, kshatriya, people, to, fight, in, order, to, protect, people, and, for, the, sake, of, justice, stating, this, is, dharma, guru, amar, das, started, the, tradition, of, appointing, manji, zones, of, religious, administration, with, an, appointed, chief, called, sangatias, introduced, the, dasvandh, tithe, system, of, revenue, collection, in, the, name, of, guru, and, as, pooled, community, religious, resource, and, the, famed, langar, tradition, of, sikhism, where, anyone, without, discrimination, of, any, kind, could, get, a, free, meal, in, a, communal, seating, the, collection, of, revenue, from, sikhs, through, regional, appointees, helped, sikhism, grow, guru, amar, das, named, his, disciple, and, son, in, law, j, h, as, the, next, guru, who, came, to, be, known, as, guru, ram, das, the, new, guru, faced, hostilities, from, the, sons, of, guru, amar, das, and, therefore, shifted, his, official, base, to, lands, identified, by, guru, amar, das, as, guru, ka, chak, he, moved, his, commune, of, sikhs, there, and, the, place, then, was, called, ramdaspur, after, him, this, city, grew, and, later, became, amritsar, the, holiest, city, of, sikhism, guru, ram, das, expanded, the, manji, organization, for, clerical, appointments, in, sikh, temples, and, for, revenue, collections, to, theologically, and, economically, support, the, sikh, movement, in, 1581, guru, arjan, the, youngest, son, of, guru, ram, das, became, the, fifth, guru, of, the, sikhs, the, choice, of, successor, as, throughout, most, of, the, history, of, sikh, guru, successions, led, to, disputes, and, internal, divisions, among, the, sikhs, the, elder, son, of, guru, ram, das, named, prithi, chand, is, remembered, in, the, sikh, tradition, as, vehemently, opposing, guru, arjan, creating, a, faction, sikh, community, which, the, sikhs, following, guru, arjan, called, as, minaas, literally, scoundrels, guru, arjan, is, remembered, among, sikhs, for, many, accomplishments, he, built, the, first, harimandir, sahib, later, to, become, the, golden, temple, he, was, a, poet, and, created, the, first, edition, of, sikh, sacred, text, known, as, the, di, granth, literally, the, first, book, and, included, the, writings, of,

developments, launched, the, singh, sabha, movement, the, first, meeting, of, the, movement, was, in, the, golden, temple, amritsar, in, 1873, and, it, was, largely, launched, by, the, sanatan, sikhs, gianis, priests, and, granthis, shortly, thereafter, nihang, sikhs, began, influencing, the, movement, followed, by, a, sustained, campaign, by, the, tat, khalsa, which, had, quickly, gained, dominance, by, the, early, 1880s, the, movement, became, a, struggle, between, sanatan, sikhs, and, tat, khalsa, in, defining, and, interpreting, sikhism, sanatan, sikhs, led, by, khem, singh, bedi, who, claimed, to, be, a, direct, descendant, of, guru, nanak, avtar, singh, vahiria, and, others, supported, a, more, inclusive, approach, which, considered, sikhism, as, a, reformed, tradition, of, hinduism, while, tat, khalsa, campaigned, for, an, exclusive, approach, to, the, sikh, identity, disagreeing, with, sanatan, sikhs, and, seeking, to, modernize, sikhism, the, sikh, sabha, movement, expanded, in, north, and, northwest, indian, subcontinent, leading, to, more, than, 100, singh, sabhas, by, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, influence, of, tat, khalsa, increased, in, interpreting, the, nature, of, sikhism, and, their, control, over, the, sikh, gurdwaras, the, tat, khalsa, banished, brahmanical, practices, including, the, use, of, the, yagna, fire, replaced, by, the, anand, karaj, marriage, ceremony, in, accordance, with, sikh, scripture, and, the, idols, and, the, images, of, sikh, gurus, from, the, golden, temple, in, 1905, traditions, which, had, taken, root, during, the, administration, of, the, mahants, during, the, 1800s, they, undertook, a, sustained, campaign, to, standardize, how, sikh, gurdwaras, looked, and, ran, while, looking, to, sikh, scriptures, and, the, early, sikh, tradition, to, purify, the, sikh, identity, the, spiritual, successors, of, the, singh, sabha, include, the, akali, movement, of, the, 1920s, as, well, as, the,

indian, independence, movement, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, ultimately, when, the, british, empire, recognized, independent, india, the, land, was, partitioned, into, hindu, majority, india, and, muslim, majority, pakistan, east, and, west, in, 1947, according, to, banga, the, partition, was, a, watershed, event, in, sikh, history, the, sikhs, had, historically, lived, in, northwestern, region, of, indian, subcontinent, on, both, sides, of, the, partition, line, radcliffe, line, according, to, banga, and, other, scholars, the, sikhs, had, strongly, opposed, the, muslim, league, demands, and, saw, it, as, perpetuation, of, muslim, domination, and, anti, sikh, policies, in, what, just, a, hundred, years, before, was, a, part, of, the, sikh, empire, as, such, sikh, organizations, including, the, chief, khalsa, dewan, and, shiromani, akali, dal, led, by, master, tara, singh, condemned, the, lahore, resolution, and, the, movement, to, create, pakistan, viewing, it, as, inviting, possible, persecution, the, sikhs, largely, thus, strongly, opposed, the, partition, of, india, during, the, discussions, with, the, colonial, authorities, tara, singh, emerged, as, an, important, leader, who, campaigned, to, prevent, the, partition, of, colonial, india, and, for, the, recognition, of, sikhs, as, a, third, community, when, partition, was, announced, the, newly, created, line, divided, the, sikh, population, along, with, hindus, sikhs, suffered, organized, violence, and, riots, against, them, in, west, pakistan, as, a, result, sikhs, moved, en, masse, to, the, indian, side, leaving, behind, their, property, and, holy, sites, however, the, anti, sikh, violence, was, not, one, sided, as, sikhs, moved, to, the, eastern, side, of, the, partition, line, they, engaged, in, reprisals, against, muslims, there, forcing, them, into, pakistan, before, the, partition, sikhs, constituted, about, 15, of, the, population, in, west, punjab, the, majority, being, muslims, 55, the, sikhs, were, the, economic, elite, in, west, punjab, however, they, had, the, largest, representation, in, west, punjab, s, aristocracy, and, there, were, nearly, 700, gurdwaras, and, 400, educational, institutions, that, served, the, interests, of, the, sikhs, prior, to, the, partition, there, were, a, series, of, disputes, between, the, majority, muslims, and, minority, sikhs, such, as, on, the, matters, of, jhatka, versus, halal, meat, the, disputed, ownership, of, gurdwara, sahidganj, in, lahore, which, muslims, sought, as, a, mosque, and, sikhs, as, a, gurdwara, and, the, insistence, of, the, provincial, muslim, government, on, switching, from, indian, gurmukhi, script, to, arabic, persian, nastaliq, script, in, schools, during, and, after, the, simla, conference, in, june, 1945, headed, by, lord, wavell, the, sikh, leaders, initially, expressed, their, desire, to, be, recognized, as, a, third, community, but, ultimately, relegated, these, demands, and, sought, a, united, india, where, sikhs, hindus, and, muslims, would, live, together, under, a, swiss, style, constitution, the, muslim, league, rejected, this, approach, demanding, that, the, entire, punjab, should, be, granted, to, pakistan, the, sikh, leaders, then, sought, the, original, partition, instead, and, the, congress, working, committee, passed, a, resolution, in, support, of, partitioning, punjab, and, bengal, between, march, and, august, 1947, a, series, of, riots, arson, plunder, of, sikh, and, property, assassination, of, sikh, leaders,

4, million, out, of, a, total, of, 28, million, in, punjab, and, 6, million, out, of, nearly, 400, million, in, india, they, did, not, constitute, the, majority, not, even, in, a, single, district, when, the, partition, line, was, formally, announced, in, august, 1947, the, violence, was, unprecedented, with, sikhs, being, one, of, the, most, affected, religious, community, both, in, terms, of, deaths, as, well, as, property, loss, injury, trauma, and, disruption, sikhs, and, muslims, were, both, victims, and, perpetrators, of, retaliatory, violence, against, each, other, estimates, range,
