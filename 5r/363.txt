the, rat, is, destructive, and, a, menace, to, crops, the, sanskrit, word, m, aka, mouse, is, derived, from, the, root, m, stealing, robbing, it, was, essential, to, subdue, the, rat, as, a,

vigneshvara, lord, of, obstacles, and, gives, evidence, of, his, possible, role, as, a, folk, gr, ma, devat, village, deity, who, later, rose, to, greater, prominence, martin, dubost, notes, a, view, that, the, rat, is, a, symbol, suggesting, that, ganesha, like, the, rat, penetrates, even, the, most, secret, places, ganesha, is, vighneshvara, vighnaraja, marathi, vighnaharta, the, lord, of, obstacles, both, of, a, material, and, spiritual, order, he, is, popularly, worshipped, as, a, remover, of, obstacles, though, traditionally, he, also, places, obstacles, in, the, path, of, those, who, need, to, be, checked, hence, he, is, often, worshipped, by, the, people, before, they, begin, anything, new, paul, courtright, says, that, ganesha, s, dharma, and, his, raison, d, tre, is, to, create, and, remove, obstacles, krishan, notes, that, some, of, ganesha, s, names, reflect, shadings, of, multiple, roles, that, have, evolved, over, time, dhavalikar, ascribes, the, quick, ascension, of, ganesha, in, the, hindu, pantheon, and, the, emergence, of, the, ganapatyas, to, this, shift, in, emphasis, from, vighnakart, obstacle, creator, to, vighnahart, obstacle, averter, however, both, functions, continue, to, be, vital, to, his, character, ganesha, is, considered, to, be, the, lord, of, letters, and, learning, in, sanskrit, the, word, buddhi, is, an, active, noun, that, is, variously, translated, as, intelligence, wisdom, or, intellect, the, concept, of, buddhi, is, closely, associated, with, the, personality, of, ganesha, especially, in, the, puranic, period, when, many, stories, stress, his, cleverness, and, love, of, intelligence, one, of, ganesha, s, names, in, the, ganesha, purana, and, the, ganesha, sahasranama, is, buddhipriya, this, name, also, appears,

a, deity, by, this, name, having, an, elephant, or, elephant, headed, form, at, this, early, stage, ga, apati, vin, yaka, had, yet, to, make, his, debut, the, pashupati, seal, c, 2300, bce, 2000, bce,

period, one, theory, of, the, origin, of, ganesha, is, that, he, gradually, came, to, prominence, in, connection, with, the, four, vinayakas, vin, yakas, in, hindu, mythology, the, vin, yakas, were, a, group, of, four, troublesome, demons, who, created, obstacles, and, difficulties, but, who, were, easily, propitiated, the, name, vin, yaka, is, a, common, name, for, ganesha, both, in, the, pur, as, and, in, buddhist, tantras, krishan, is, one, of, the, academics, who, accept, this, view, stating, flatly, of, ganesha, he, is, a, non, vedic, god, his, origin, is, to, be, traced, to, the, four, vin, yakas, evil, spirits, of, the, m, navag, hyas, tra, 7th, 4th, century, bce, who, cause, various, types, of, evil, and, suffering, depictions, of, elephant, headed, human, figures, which, some, identify, with, ganesha, appear, in, indian, art, and, coinage, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, according, to, ellawala, the, elephant, headed, ganesha, as, lord, of, the, ganas, was, known, to, the, people, of, sri, lanka, in, the, early, pre, christian, era, the, title, leader, of, the, group, sanskrit, ga, apati, occurs, twice, in, the, rig, veda, but, in, neither, case, does, it, refer, to, the, modern, ganesha, the, term, appears, in, rv, 2, 23, 1, as, a, title, for, brahmanaspati, according, to, commentators, while, this, verse, doubtless, refers, to, brahmanaspati, it, was, later, adopted, for, worship, of, ganesha, and, is, still, used, today, in, rejecting, any, claim, that, this, passage, is, evidence, of, ganesha, in, the, rig, veda, ludo, rocher, says, that, it, clearly, refers, to, b, haspati, who, is, the, deity, of, the, hymn, and, b, haspati, only, equally, clearly, the, second, passage, rv, 10, 112, 9, refers, to, indra, who, is, given, the, epithet, ga, apati, translated, lord, of, the, companies, of, the, maruts, however, rocher, notes, that, the, more, recent, ganapatya, literature, often, quotes, the, rigvedic, verses, to, give, vedic, respectability, to, ganesha, the, sangam, period, tamil, poet, avvaiyar, 3rd, century, bce, invokes, ganesha, while, preparing, the, invitation, to, the, three, tamil, kingdoms, for, giving, away, in, marriage, of,

14th, century, commentator, sayana, explicitly, establishes, this, identification, the, description, of, dantin, possessing, a, twisted, trunk, vakratu, a, and, holding, a, corn, sheaf, a, sugar, cane, and, a, club, is, so, characteristic, of, the, puranic, ganapati, that, heras, says, we, cannot, resist, to, accept, his, full, identification, with, this, vedic, dantin, however, krishan, considers, these, hymns, to, be, post, vedic, additions, thapan, reports, that, these, passages, are, generally, considered, to, have, been, interpolated, dhavalikar, says, the, references, to, the, elephant, headed, deity, in, the, maitr, ya, sa, hit, have, been, proven, to, be, very, late, interpolations, and, thus, are, not, very, helpful, for, determining, the, early, formation, of, the, deity, ganesha, does, not, appear, in, the, indian, epic, literature, that, is, dated, to, the, vedic, period, a, late, interpolation, to, the, epic, poem, mahabharata, 1, 1, 75, 79, says, that, the, sage, vyasa, vy, sa, asked, ganesha, to, serve, as, his, scribe, to, transcribe, the, poem, as, he, dictated, it, to, him, ganesha, agreed, but, only, on, the, condition, that, vyasa, recites, the, poem, uninterrupted, that, is, without, pausing, the, sage, agreed, but, found, that, to, get, any, rest, he, needed, to, recite, very, complex, passages, so, ganesha, would, have, to, ask, for, clarifications, the, story, is, not, accepted, as, part, of, the, original, text, by, the, editors, of, the, critical, edition, of, the, mahabharata, in, which, the, twenty, line, story, is, relegated, to, a, footnote, in, an, appendix, the, story, of, ganesha, acting, as, the, scribe, occurs, in, 37, of, the, 59, manuscripts, consulted, during, the, preparation, of, the, critical, edition, ganesha, s, association, with, mental, agility, and, learning, is, one, reason, he, is, shown, as, scribe, for, vy, sa, s, dictation, of, the, mahabharata, in, this, interpolation, richard, l, brown, dates, the, story, to, the, 8th, century, and, moriz, winternitz, concludes, that, it, was, known, as, early, as, c, 900, but, it, was, not, added, to, the, mahabharata, some, 150, years, later, winternitz, also, notes, that, a, distinctive, feature, in, south, indian, manuscripts, of, the, mahabharata, is, their, omission, of, this, ganesha, legend, the, term, vin, yaka, is, found, in, some, recensions, of, the, ntiparva, and, anu, sanaparva, that, are, regarded, as, interpolations, a, reference, to, vighnakart, m, creator, of, obstacles, in, vanaparva, is, also, believed, to, be, an, interpolation, and, does, not, appear, in, the, critical, edition, stories, about, ganesha, often, occur, in, the, puranic, corpus, brown, notes, while, the, puranas, defy, precise, chronological, ordering, the, more, detailed, narratives, of, ganesha, s, life, are, in, the, late, texts, c, 600, 1300, yuvraj, krishan, says, that, the, puranic, myths, about, the, birth, of, ganesha, and, how, he, acquired, an, elephant, s, head, are, in, the, later, puranas, which, were, composed, of, c, 600, onwards, he, elaborates, on, the, matter, to, say, that, references, to, ganesha, in, the, earlier, puranas, such, as, the, vayu, and, brahmanda, puranas, are, later, interpolations, made, during, the, 7th, 10th, centuries, in, his, survey, of, ganesha, s, rise, to, prominence, in, sanskrit, literature, ludo, rocher, notes, that, above, all, one, cannot, help, being, struck, by, the, fact, that, the, numerous, stories, surrounding, ga, e, a, concentrate, on, an, unexpectedly, limited, number, of, incidents, these, incidents, are, mainly, three, his, birth, and, parenthood, his, elephant, head, and, his, single, tusk, other, incidents, are, touched, on, in, the, texts, but, to, a, far, lesser, extent, ganesha, s, rise, to, prominence, was, codified, in, the, 9th, century, when, he, was, formally, included, as, one, of, the, five, primary, deities, of, smartism, the, 9th, century, philosopher, adi, shankara, popularised, the, worship, of, the, five, forms, panchayatana, puja, system, among, orthodox, brahmins, of, the, smarta, tradition, this,

major, sects, on, an, equal, status, this, formalised, the, role, of, ganesha, as, a, complementary, deity, in, the, ganapatya, tradition, founded, in, the, ganesha, purana, and, the, mudgala, purana,

mudgala, purana, and, their, dating, relative, to, one, another, has, sparked, academic, debate, both, works, were, developed, over, time, and, contain, age, layered, strata, anita, thapan, reviews, comment, about, dating, and, provide, her, own, judgment, it, seems, likely, that, the, core, of, the, ganesha, purana, appeared, around, the, twelfth, and, thirteenth, centuries, she, says, but, was, later, interpolated, lawrence, w, preston, considers, the, most, reasonable, date, for, the, ganesha, purana, to, be, between, 1100, and, 1400, which, coincides, with, the, apparent, age, of, the, sacred, sites, mentioned, by, the, text, r, c, hazra, suggests, that, the, mudgala, purana, is, older, than, the, ganesha, purana, which, he, dates, between, 1100, and, 1400, however, phyllis, granoff, finds, problems, with, this, relative, dating, and, concludes, that, the, mudgala, purana, was, the, last, of, the, philosophical, texts, concerned, with, ganesha, she, bases, her, reasoning, on, the, fact, that, among, other, internal, evidence, the, mudgala, purana, specifically, mentions, the, ganesha, purana, as, one, of, the, four, puranas, the, brahma, the, brahmanda, the, ganesha, and, the, mudgala, puranas, which, deal, at, length, with, ganesha, while, the, kernel, of, the, text, must, be, old, it, was, interpolated, until, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, as, the, worship, of, ganapati, became, more, important, in, certain, regions, another, highly, regarded, scripture, in, the, ganapatya, tradition, the, sanskrit, ganapati, atharvashirsa, was, probably, composed,
