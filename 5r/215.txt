mormonism, is, the, theology, and, religious, tradition, of, the, latter, day, saint, movement, of, restorationist, christianity, started, by, joseph, smith, in, western, new, york, in, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, as, a, label, mormonism, has, been, applied, to, various, aspects, of, the, latter, day, saint, movement, although, since, 2018, there, has, been, a, push, from, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, to, distance, itself, from, this, label, one, historian, sydney, e, ahlstrom, wrote, in, 1982, that, depending, on, the, context, the, term, mormonism, could, refer, to, a, sect, a, mystery, cult, a, new, religion, a, church, a, people, a, nation, or, an, american, subculture, indeed, at, different, times, and, places, it, is, all, of, these, a, prominent, feature, of, mormon, theology, is, the, book, of, mormon, which, describes, itself, as, a, chronicle, of, early, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, and, their, dealings, with, god, mormon, theology, includes, mainstream, christian, beliefs, with, modifications, stemming, from, belief, in, revelations, to, smith, and, other, religious, leaders, this, includes, the, use, of, and, belief, in, the, bible, and, other, religious, texts, including, the, doctrine, and, covenants, and, the, pearl, of, great, price, mormonism, includes, significant, doctrines, of, eternal, marriage, eternal, progression, baptism, for, the, dead, polygamy, or, plural, marriage, sexual, purity, health, specified, in, the, word, of, wisdom, fasting, and, sabbath, observance, the, theology, itself, is, not, uniform, as, early, as, 1831, and, most, significantly, after, smith, s, death, various, groups, split, from, the, church, of, christ, that, smith, established, other, than, differences, in, leadership, these, groups, most, significantly, differ, in, their, stances, on, polygamy, which, the, utah, based, lds, church, banned, in, 1890, and, trinitarianism, which, the, lds, church, does, not, affirm, the, branch, of, theology, which, seeks, to, maintain, the, practice, of, polygamy, is, known, as, mormon, fundamentalism, and, includes, several, different, churches, other, groups, affirm, trinitarianism, such, as, the, community, of, christ, formerly, the, reorganized, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, and, describe, their, doctrine, as, trinitarian, christian, restorationist, cultural, mormonism, is, a, term, coined, by, cultural, mormons, who, identify, with, the, culture, especially, present, in, much, of, the, american, west, but, do, not, necessarily, identify, with, the, theology, the, doctrines, of, mormonism, began, with, the, farmboy, joseph, smith, in, the, 1820s, in, western, new, york, during, a, period, of, religious, excitement, known, as, the, second, great, awakening, smith, at, 14, years, old, was, determined, to, find, out, which, church, taught, the, true, doctrine, of, god, he, believed, that, god, existed, but, was, confused, by, what, he, believed, to, be, contradictions, in, the, beliefs, of, churches, available, to, him, in, joseph, smith, history, he, wrote, while, i, was, laboring, under, the, extreme, difficulties, caused, by, the, contests, of, these, parties, of, religionists, i, was, one, day, reading, the, epistle, of, james, first, chapter, and, fifth, verse, which, reads, if, any, of, you, lack, wisdom, let, him, ask, of, god, that, giveth, to, all, men, liberally, and, upbraideth, not, and, it, shall, be, given, him, after, praying, about, which, denomination, he, should, join, smith, said, he, received, a, vision, in, the, spring, of, 1820, called, the, first, vision, smith, said, that, god, the, father, and, his, son, jesus, christ, appeared, to, him, and, instructed, him, to, join, none, of, the, existing, churches, because, they, were, all, wrong, during, the, 1820s, smith, chronicled, several, angelic, visitations, and, was, eventually, told, by, the, angels, that, god, would, use, him, to, re, establish, the, true, christian, church, joseph, smith, said, the, book, of, mormon, was, translated, into, english, from, writings, he, found, on, golden, plates, in, a, reformed, egyptian, language, they, were, translated, with, the, assistance, of, the, urim, and, thummim, and, seer, stones, he, said, an, angel, first, showed, him, the, location, of, the, plates, in, 1823, they, were, buried, in, a, nearby, hill, with, the, assistance, of, martin, harris, an, early, follower, smith, began, dictating, the, text, of, the, book, of, mormon, on, april, 12, 1828, despite, interruption, of, translation, work, by, persecution, smith, s, continued, employment, in, order, to, support, his, family, and, harris, s, loss, of, 116, pages, the, book, of, mormon, manuscript, was, finished, in, june, 1829, smith, said, the, plates, were, returned, to, the, angel, after, he, finished, the, translation, during, the, time, smith, said, he, possessed, the, plates, 15, people, were, allowed, to, witness, their, existence, the, book, of, mormon, claims, to, be, a, chronicle, of, early, israelites, who, left, the, near, east, and, traveled, to, the, americas, the, book, begins, c, 600, bc, with, the, departure, from, jerusalem, of, the, family, of, the, prophet, lehi, at, the, urging, of, god, and, their, sailing, c, 589, bc, to, the, americas, it, tells, of, people, in, the, americas, i, e, first, nations, americans, with, a, belief, in, christ, hundreds, of, years, before, his, birth, their, witnessing, his, personal, visitation, to, them, after, his, resurrection, and, of, their, eventually, losing, christianity, after, generations, of, wars, and, apostasy, the, book, of, mormon, and, continuing, revelations, would, be, the, means, of, establishing, correct, doctrine, for, the, restored, church, smith, oliver, cowdery, and, other, early, followers, began, baptizing, new, converts, in, 1829, and, formally, organized, in, 1830, as, the, church, of, christ, smith, was, seen, by, his, followers, as, a, modern, day, prophet, historical, accuracy, and, veracity, of, the, book, of, mormon, was, at, the, time, of, its, publication, and, continuing, to, the, present, day, hotly, contested, along, with, disputes, over, the, book, of, mormon, the, early, church, of, christ, faced, persecution, from, residents, of, several, towns, when, they, tried, to, gather, and, establish, god, s, kingdom, on, the, earth, to, avoid, confrontation, in, palmyra, new, york, the, members, moved, to, kirtland, ohio, and, hoped, to, establish, a, permanent, new, jerusalem, or, city, of, zion, in, jackson, county, missouri, however, they, were, expelled, from, jackson, county, in, 1833, and, fled, to, other, parts, of, missouri, in, 1838, violence, between, the, missourians, and, church, members, resulted, in, the, governor, of, missouri, issuing, an, extermination, order, against, the, mormons, as, they, were, called, which, again, forced, the, church, to, relocate, the, displaced, church, fled, to, illinois, to, a, small, town, called, commerce, under, smith, s, direction, the, church, bought, the, town, renamed, it, nauvoo, and, lived, with, a, degree, of, peace, and, prosperity, for, a, few, years, however, tensions, between, mormons, and, their, neighbors, again, escalated, and, in, 1844, smith, was, killed, by, a, mob, precipitating, a, succession, crisis, the, largest, group, of, mormons, followed, brigham, young, as, the, new, prophet, and, under, his, direction, emigrated, to, what, became, the, utah, territory, there, the, church, began, the, open, practice, of, plural, marriage, a, form, of, polygyny, which, smith, had, instituted, in, nauvoo, plural, marriage, became, the, faith, s, most, sensational, characteristic, during, the, 19th, century, but, vigorous, opposition, by, the, united, states, congress, threatened, the, church, s, existence, as, a, legal, institution, further, polygamy, was, also, a, major, cause, for, the, opposition, to, mormonism, in, the, states, of, idaho, and, arizona, in, the, 1890, manifesto, church, president, wilford, woodruff, announced, the, official, end, of, plural, marriage, due, to, this, formal, abolition, of, plural, marriage, several, smaller, groups, broke, with, the, lds, church, and, formed, denominations, following, what, they, called, mormon, fundamentalism, however, the, lds, church, has, experienced, the, most, growth, out, of, any, of, the, churches, following, mormonism, with, a, current, membership, of, over, 16, million, in, orthodox, mormonism, the, term, god, generally, refers, to, the, biblical, god, the, father, whom, latter, day, saints, refer, to, as, elohim, and, the, term, godhead, refers, to, a, council, of, three, distinct, divine, persons, consisting, of, god, the, father, jesus, christ, his, firstborn, son, whom, latter, day, saints, refer, to, as, jehovah, and, the, holy, ghost, latter, day, saints, believe, that, the, father, son, and, holy, ghost, are, three, distinct, beings, and, that, the, father, and, jesus, have, perfected, glorified, physical, bodies, while, the, holy, ghost, is, a, spirit, without, a, physical, body, latter, day, saints, also, believe, that, there, are, other, gods, and, goddesses, outside, the, godhead, such, as, a, heavenly, mother, who, is, married, to, god, the, father, and, that, faithful, latter, day, saints, may, attain, godhood, in, the, afterlife, joseph, smith, taught, that, god, was, once, a, man, on, another, planet, before, being, exalted, to, godhood, this, conception, differs, from, the, traditional, christian, trinity, in, several, ways, one, of, which, is, that, mormonism, has, not, adopted, or, continued, to, hold, the, doctrine, of, the, nicene, creed, that, the, father, son, and, holy, ghost, are, of, the, same, substance, or, being, also, mormonism, teaches, that, the, intelligence, dwelling, in, each, human, is, coeternal, with, god, mormons, use, the, term, omnipotent, to, describe, god, and, regard, him, as, the, creator, they, understand, him, as, being, almighty, and, eternal, but, subject, to, eternal, natural, law, which, governs, intelligences, justice, and, the, eternal, nature, of, matter, i, e, god, organized, the, world, but, did, not, create, it, from, nothing, the, mormon, conception, of, god, also, differs, substantially, from, the, jewish, tradition, of, ethical, monotheism, in, which, elohim, is, a, completely, different, conception, this, description, of, god, represents, the, mormon, orthodoxy, formalized, in, 1915, based, on, earlier, teachings, other, currently, existing, and, historical, branches, of, mormonism, have, adopted, different, views, of, god, such, as, the, adam, god, doctrine, and, trinitarianism, mormonism, describes, itself, as, falling, within, world, christianity, but, as, a, distinct, restored, dispensation, it, characterizes, itself, as, the, only, true, form, of, the, christian, religion, since, the, time, of, a, great, apostasy, that, began, not, long, after, the, ascension, of, jesus, christ, according, to, mormons, this, apostasy, involved, the, corruption, of, the, pure, original, christian, doctrine, with, greek, and, other, philosophies, and, followers, dividing, into, different, ideological, groups, additionally, mormons, claim, the, martyrdom, of, the, apostles, led, to, the, loss, of, priesthood, authority, to, administer, the, church, and, its, ordinances, mormons, believe, that, god, re, established, the, 1st, century, early, christian, church, as, found, in, the, new, testament, through, the, restoration, of, joseph, smith, in, particular, mormons, believe, that, angels, such, as, peter, james, john, and, john, the, baptist, appeared, to, joseph, smith, and, others, and, bestowed, various, priesthood, authorities, on, them, mormons, thus, believe, that, their, church, is, the, only, true, and, living, church, because, divine, authority, was, restored, to, it, through, smith, in, addition, mormons, believe, that, smith, and, his, legitimate, successors, are, modern, prophets, who, receive, revelation, from, god, to, guide, the, church, they, maintain, that, other, christian, religions, have, a, portion, of, the, truth, and, are, guided, by, the, light, of, christ, smith, s, cosmology, is, laid, out, mostly, in, smith, s, later, revelations, and, sermons, but, particularly, the, book, of, abraham, the, book, of, moses, and, the, king, follett, discourse, mormon, cosmology, presents, a, unique, view, of, god, and, the, universe, and, places, a, high, importance, on, human, agency, in, mormonism, life, on, earth, is, just, a, short, part, of, an, eternal, existence, mormons, believe, that, in, the, beginning, all, people, existed, as, spirits, or, intelligences, in, the, presence, of, god, in, this, state, god, proposed, a, plan, of, salvation, whereby, they, could, progress, and, have, a, privilege, to, advance, like, himself, the, spirits, were, free, to, accept, or, reject, this, plan, and, a, third, of, them, led, by, satan, rejected, it, the, rest, accepted, the, plan, coming, to, earth, and, receiving, bodies, with, an, understanding, that, they, would, experience, sin, and, suffering, in, mormonism, the, central, part, of, god, s, plan, is, the, atonement, of, jesus, christ, mormons, believe, that, one, purpose, of, earthly, life, is, to, learn, to, choose, good, over, evil, in, this, process, people, inevitably, make, mistakes, becoming, unworthy, to, return, to, the, presence, of, god, mormons, believe, that, jesus, paid, for, the, sins, of, the, world, and, that, all, people, can, be, saved, through, his, atonement, mormons, accept, christ, s, atonement, through, faith, repentance, formal, covenants, or, ordinances, such, as, baptism, and, consistently, trying, to, live, a, christ, like, life, according, to, mormon, scripture, the, earth, s, creation, was, not, ex, nihilo, but, organized, from, existing, matter, the, earth, is, just, one, of, many, inhabited, worlds, and, there, are, many, governing, heavenly, bodies, including, the, planet, or, star, kolob, which, is, said, to, be, nearest, the, throne, of, god, mormon, theology, teaches, that, the, united, states, is, a, unique, place, and, that, mormons, are, god, s, chosen, people, selected, for, a, singular, destiny, the, book, of, mormon, alludes, to, the, united, states, as, being, the, biblical, promised, land, with, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, being, divinely, inspired, and, argues, that, america, is, an, exceptional, nation, in, upstate, new, york, in, 1823, joseph, smith, claimed, to, have, had, a, vision, in, which, the, angel, moroni, told, him, about, engraved, golden, plates, buried, in, a, nearby, hill, according, to, smith, he, received, subsequent, instruction, from, moroni, and, four, years, later, excavated, the, plates, and, translated, them, from, reformed, egyptian, into, english, the, resultant, book, of, mormon, so, called, after, an, ancient, american, prophet, who, according, to, smith, had, compiled, the, text, recorded, on, the, golden, plates, recounts, the, history, of, a, tribe, of, israelites, led, by, the, prophet, lehi, who, migrated, from, jerusalem, to, the, americas, in, the, 7th, century, bce, in, mormonism, these, israelite, tribes, who, migrated, to, the, americas, centuries, before, the, birth, of, jesus, christ, are, considered, to, be, among, the, ancestors, of, pre, columbian, native, americans, joseph, smith, argued, that, the, millennial, new, jerusalem, was, to, be, built, in, america, 10th, article, of, faith, in, the, doctrine, and, covenants, smith, records, god, as, saying, it, is, not, right, that, any, man, should, be, in, bondage, one, to, another, and, for, this, purpose, have, i, established, the, constitution, of, this, land, by, the, hands, of, wise, men, whom, i, raised, up, unto, this, very, purpose, and, redeemed, the, land, by, the, shedding, of, blood, d, c, 101, 79, 80, to, mormons, this, places, america, as, the, originator, of, religious, liberty, and, freedom, while, noting, a, need, to, expand, these, american, values, worldwide, although, officially, shunned, by, the, lds, church, fundamentalist, mormons, believe, in, the, white, horse, prophecy, which, argues, that, mormons, will, be, called, upon, to, preserve, the, constitution, as, it, hangs, by, a, thread, in, mormonism, an, ordinance, is, a, religious, ritual, of, special, significance, often, involving, the, formation, of, a, covenant, with, god, ordinances, are, performed, by, the, authority, of, the, priesthood, and, in, the, name, of, jesus, christ, the, term, has, a, meaning, roughly, similar, to, that, of, the, term, sacrament, in, other, christian, denominations, saving, ordinances, or, ordinances, viewed, as, necessary, for, salvation, include, baptism, by, immersion, after, the, age, of, accountability, normally, age, 8, confirmation, and, reception, of, the, gift, of, the, holy, ghost, performed, by, laying, hands, on, the, head, of, a, newly, baptized, member, ordination, to, the, aaronic, and, melchizedek, priesthoods, for, males, an, endowment, including, washing, and, anointing, received, in, temples, and, marriage, or, sealing, to, a, spouse, mormons, also, perform, other, ordinances, which, include, the, lord, s, supper, commonly, called, the, sacrament, naming, and, blessing, children, giving, priesthood, blessings, and, patriarchal, blessings, anointing, and, blessing, the, sick, participating, in, prayer, circles, and, setting, apart, individuals, who, are, called, to, church, positions, in, mormonism, the, saving, ordinances, are, seen, as, necessary, for, salvation, but, they, are, not, sufficient, in, and, of, themselves, for, example, baptism, is, required, for, exaltation, but, simply, having, been, baptized, does, not, guarantee, any, eternal, reward, the, baptized, person, is, expected, to, be, obedient, to, god, s, commandments, to, repent, of, any, sinful, conduct, subsequent, to, baptism, and, to, receive, the, other, saving, ordinances, because, mormons, believe, that, everyone, must, receive, certain, ordinances, to, be, saved, mormons, perform, ordinances, on, behalf, of, deceased, persons, these, ordinances, are, performed, vicariously, or, by, proxy, on, behalf, of, the, dead, in, accordance, with, their, belief, in, each, individual, s, free, agency, living, or, dead, mormons, believe, that, the, deceased, may, accept, or, reject, the, offered, ordinance, in, the, spirit, world, just, as, all, spirits, decided, to, accept, or, reject, god, s, plan, originally, in, addition, these, conditional, ordinances, on, behalf, of, the, dead, are, performed, only, when, a, deceased, person, s, genealogical, information, has, been, submitted, to, a, temple, and, correctly, processed, there, before, the, ordinance, ritual, is, performed, only, ordinances, for, salvation, are, performed, on, behalf, of, deceased, persons, mormons, believe, in, the, old, and, new, testaments, and, the, lds, church, uses, the, authorized, king, james, version, as, its, official, scriptural, text, of, the, bible, while, mormons, believe, in, the, general, accuracy, of, the, modern, day, text, of, the, bible, they, also, believe, that, it, is, incomplete, and, that, errors, have, been, introduced, according, to, mormon, theology, many, lost, truths, are, restored, in, the, book, of, mormon, which, mormons, hold, to, be, divine, scripture, and, equal, in, authority, to, the, bible, the, mormon, scriptural, canon, also, includes, a, collection, of, revelations, and, writings, contained, in, the, doctrine, and, covenants, which, contains, doctrine, and, prophecy, and, the, pearl, of, great, price, which, addresses, briefly, genesis, to, exodus, these, books, as, well, as, the, joseph, smith, translation, of, the, bible, have, varying, degrees, of, acceptance, as, divine, scripture, among, different, denominations, of, the, latter, day, saint, movement, in, mormonism, continuous, revelation, is, the, principle, that, god, or, his, divine, agents, still, continue, to, communicate, to, mankind, this, communication, can, be, manifest, in, many, ways, influences, of, the, holy, ghost, the, principal, form, in, which, this, principle, is, manifest, visions, visitations, of, divine, beings, and, others, joseph, smith, used, the, example, of, the, lord, s, revelations, to, moses, in, deuteronomy, to, explain, the, importance, of, continuous, revelation, god, said, thou, shalt, not, kill, at, another, time, he, said, thou, shalt, utterly, destroy, this, is, the, principle, on, which, the, government, of, heaven, is, conducted, by, revelation, adapted, to, the, circumstances, in, which, the, children, of, the, kingdom, are, placed, whatever, god, requires, is, right, no, matter, what, it, is, although, we, may, not, see, the, reason, thereof, till, long, after, the, events, transpire, mormons, believe, that, smith, and, subsequent, church, leaders, could, speak, scripture, when, moved, upon, by, the, holy, ghost, in, addition, many, mormons, believe, that, ancient, prophets, in, other, regions, of, the, world, received, revelations, that, resulted, in, additional, scriptures, that, have, been, lost, and, may, one, day, be, forthcoming, in, mormonism, revelation, is, not, limited, to, church, members, for, instance, latter, day, saints, believe, that, the, united, states, constitution, is, a, divinely, inspired, document, mormons, are, encouraged, to, develop, a, personal, relationship, with, the, holy, ghost, and, receive, personal, revelation, for, their, own, direction, and, that, of, their, family, the, latter, day, saint, concept, of, revelation, includes, the, belief, that, revelation, from, god, is, available, to, all, those, who, earnestly, seek, it, with, the, intent, of, doing, good, it, also, teaches, that, everyone, is, entitled, to, personal, revelation, with, respect, to, his, or, her, stewardship, leadership, responsibility, thus, parents, may, receive, inspiration, from, god, in, raising, their, families, individuals, can, receive, divine, inspiration, to, help, them, meet, personal, challenges, church, officers, may, receive, revelation, for, those, whom, they, serve, the, important, consequence, of, this, is, that, each, person, may, receive, confirmation, that, particular, doctrines, taught, by, a, prophet, are, true, as, well, as, gain, divine, insight, in, using, those, truths, for, their, own, benefit, and, eternal, progress, in, the, church, personal, revelation, is, expected, and, encouraged, and, many, converts, believe, that, personal, revelation, from, god, was, instrumental, in, their, conversion, mormonism, categorizes, itself, within, christianity, and, nearly, all, mormons, self, identify, as, christian, for, some, who, define, christianity, within, the, doctrines, of, catholicism, eastern, and, oriental, orthodoxy, the, churches, of, the, east, and, protestantism, mormonism, s, differences, place, it, outside, the, umbrella, of, christianity, since, its, beginnings, the, faith, has, proclaimed, itself, to, be, christ, s, church, restored, with, its, original, authority, structure, and, power, maintaining, that, existing, denominations, believed, in, incorrect, doctrines, and, were, not, acknowledged, by, god, as, his, church, and, kingdom, though, the, religion, quickly, gained, a, large, following, of, christian, seekers, in, the, 1830s, many, american, christians, came, to, view, the, church, s, early, doctrines, and, practices, as, politically, and, culturally, subversive, as, well, as, doctrinally, heretical, abominable, and, condemnable, this, discord, led, to, a, series, of, sometimes, deadly, conflicts, between, mormons, and, others, who, saw, themselves, as, orthodox, christians, although, such, violence, declined, during, the, twentieth, century, the, religion, s, unique, doctrinal, views, and, practices, still, generate, criticism, sometimes, vehemently, so, this, gives, rise, to, efforts, by, mormons, and, opposing, types, of, christians, to, proselytize, each, other, mormons, believe, in, jesus, christ, as, the, literal, son, of, god, and, messiah, his, crucifixion, as, a, conclusion, of, a, sin, offering, and, subsequent, resurrection, however, latter, day, saints, lds, reject, the, ecumenical, creeds, and, the, definition, of, the, trinity, in, contrast, the, second, largest, latter, day, saint, denomination, the, community, of, christ, is, trinitarian, and, monotheistic, mormons, hold, the, view, that, the, new, testament, prophesied, both, the, apostasy, from, the, teachings, of, christ, and, his, apostles, as, well, as, the, restoration, of, all, things, prior, to, the, second, coming, of, christ, some, notable, differences, with, mainstream, christianity, include, a, belief, that, jesus, began, his, atonement, in, the, garden, of, gethsemane, and, continued, it, to, his, crucifixion, rather, than, the, orthodox, belief, that, the, crucifixion, alone, was, the, physical, atonement, and, an, afterlife, with, three, degrees, of, glory, with, hell, often, called, spirit, prison, being, a, temporary, repository, for, the, wicked, between, death, and, the, resurrection, additionally, mormons, do, not, believe, in, creation, ex, nihilo, believing, that, matter, is, eternal, and, creation, involved, god, organizing, existing, matter, much, of, the, mormon, belief, system, is, geographically, oriented, around, the, north, and, south, american, continents, mormons, believe, that, the, people, of, the, book, of, mormon, lived, in, the, western, hemisphere, that, christ, appeared, in, the, western, hemisphere, after, his, death, and, resurrection, that, the, true, faith, was, restored, in, upstate, new, york, by, joseph, smith, that, the, garden, of, eden, was, located, in, north, america, and, that, the, new, jerusalem, would, be, built, in, missouri, for, this, and, other, reasons, including, a, belief, by, many, mormons, in, american, exceptionalism, molly, worthen, speculates, that, this, may, be, why, leo, tolstoy, described, mormonism, as, the, quintessential, american, religion, although, mormons, do, not, claim, to, be, part, of, judaism, mormon, theology, claims, to, situate, mormonism, within, the, context, of, judaism, to, an, extent, that, goes, beyond, what, most, other, christian, denominations, claim, the, faith, incorporates, many, old, testament, ideas, into, its, theology, and, the, beliefs, of, mormons, sometimes, parallel, those, of, judaism, and, certain, elements, of, jewish, culture, in, the, earliest, days, of, mormonism, joseph, smith, taught, that, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, were, members, of, some, of, the, lost, tribes, of, israel, later, he, taught, that, mormons, were, israelites, and, that, they, may, learn, of, their, tribal, affiliation, within, the, twelve, israelite, tribes, members, of, the, lds, church, receive, patriarchal, blessings, which, declare, the, recipient, s, lineage, within, one, of, the, tribes, of, israel, the, lineage, is, either, through, true, blood, line, or, adoption, the, lds, church, teaches, that, if, one, is, not, a, direct, descendant, of, one, of, the, twelve, tribes, upon, baptism, he, or, she, is, adopted, into, one, of, the, tribes, patriarchal, blessings, also, include, personal, information, which, is, revealed, through, a, patriarch, by, the, power, of, the, priesthood, smith, hired, joshua, james, seixas, son, of, gershom, mendes, seixas, and, hebrew, school, teacher, at, congregation, shearith, israel, to, teach, mormon, leaders, hebrew, smith, himself, attended, some, of, these, classes, and, went, on, to, use, his, basic, hebrew, in, teachings, for, example, smith, named, the, largest, mormon, settlement, he, founded, nauvoo, which, means, beautiful, pl, in, biblical, hebrew, brigham, young, named, a, tributary, of, the, great, salt, lake, the, jordan, river, the, lds, church, has, a, jerusalem, center, in, israel, where, students, focus, their, study, on, near, eastern, history, culture, language, and, the, bible, there, has, been, some, controversy, involving, jewish, groups, who, see, the, actions, of, some, elements, of, mormonism, as, offensive, in, the, 1990s, jewish, groups, vocally, opposed, the, lds, practice, of, baptism, for, the, dead, on, behalf, of, jewish, victims, of, the, holocaust, and, jews, in, general, according, to, lds, church, general, authority, monte, j, brough, mormons, who, baptized, 380, 000, holocaust, victims, posthumously, were, motivated, by, love, and, compassion, and, did, not, understand, their, gesture, might, offend, jews, they, did, not, realize, that, what, they, intended, as, a, christian, act, of, service, was, misguided, and, insensitive, mormons, believe, that, when, the, dead, are, baptized, through, proxy, they, have, the, option, of, accepting, or, rejecting, the, ordinance, many, mormons, are, believers, experiencers, or, promotors, of, ufos, as, an, interstellar, or, non, human, phenomenon, matthew, bowman, scholar, of, mormon, studies, writes, that, while, some, people, use, this, to, try, to, make, mormonism, look, silly, a, good, number, of, latter, day, saints, have, welcomed, being, associated, with, ufos, latter, day, saints, have, pointed, to, the, phenomenon, as, either, entirely, consistent, with, their, faith, or, even, proof, of, it, these, folks, are, the, heirs, to, a, strain, of, theology, going, back, to, brigham, young, that, peaked, with, the, early, 20th, century, writings, of, church, leaders, like, b, h, roberts, or, john, widtsoe, mormon, theology, includes, three, main, movements, by, far, the, largest, of, these, is, mainstream, mormonism, defined, by, the, leadership, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, lds, church, the, two, broad, movements, outside, mainstream, mormonism, are, mormon, fundamentalism, and, liberal, reformist, mormonism, mainstream, mormonism, is, defined, by, the, leadership, of, the, lds, church, which, identifies, itself, as, christian, members, of, the, lds, church, consider, their, top, leaders, to, be, prophets, and, apostles, and, are, encouraged, to, accept, their, positions, on, matters, of, theology, while, seeking, confirmation, of, them, through, personal, study, of, the, book, of, mormon, and, the, bible, personal, prayer, is, encouraged, as, well, the, lds, church, is, by, far, the, largest, branch, of, mormonism, it, has, continuously, existed, since, the, succession, crisis, of, 1844, that, split, the, latter, day, saint, movement, after, the, death, of, founder, joseph, smith, jr, the, lds, church, seeks, to, distance, itself, from, other, branches, of, mormonism, particularly, those, that, practice, polygamy, the, church, maintains, a, degree, of, orthodoxy, by, excommunicating, or, disciplining, its, members, who, take, positions, or, engage, in, practices, viewed, as, apostasy, for, example, the, lds, church, excommunicates, members, who, practice, polygamy, or, who, adopt, the, beliefs, and, practices, of, mormon, fundamentalism, one, way, mormon, fundamentalism, distinguishes, itself, from, mainstream, mormonism, is, through, the, practice, of, plural, marriage, fundamentalists, initially, broke, from, the, lds, church, after, that, doctrine, was, discontinued, around, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, mormon, fundamentalism, teaches, that, plural, marriage, is, a, requirement, for, exaltation, the, highest, degree, of, salvation, which, will, allow, them, to, live, as, gods, and, goddesses, in, the, afterlife, mainstream, mormons, by, contrast, believe, that, a, single, celestial, marriage, is, necessary, for, exaltation, in, distinction, with, the, lds, church, mormon, fundamentalists, also, often, believe, in, a, number, of, other, doctrines, taught, and, practiced, by, brigham, young, in, the, 19th, century, which, the, lds, church, has, either, abandoned, repudiated, or, put, in, abeyance, these, include, mormon, fundamentalists, believe, that, these, principles, were, wrongly, abandoned, or, changed, by, the, lds, church, in, large, part, due, to, the, desire, of, its, leadership, and, members, to, assimilate, into, mainstream, american, society, and, avoid, the, persecutions, and, conflict, that, had, characterized, the, church, throughout, its, early, years, others, believe, that, it, was, a, necessity, at, some, point, for, a, restoration, of, all, things, to, be, a, truly, restored, church, some, lds, church, members, have, worked, towards, a, more, liberal, reform, of, the, church, others, have, left, the, lds, church, and, still, consider, themselves, to, be, cultural, mormons, others, have, formed, new, religions, many, of, them, now, defunct, for, instance, the, godbeites, broke, away, from, the, lds, church, in, the, late, 19th, century, on, the, basis, of, both, political, and, religious, liberalism, and, in, 1985, the, restoration, church, of, jesus, christ, broke, away, from, the, lds, church, as, an, lgbt, friendly, denomination, which, was, formally, dissolved, in, 2010, as, the, largest, denomination, within, mormonism, the, lds, church, has, been, the, subject, of, criticism, since, it, was, founded, by, joseph, smith, in, 1830, perhaps, the, most, controversial, and, a, key, contributing, factor, for, smith, s, murder, is, the, claim, that, plural, marriage, as, defenders, call, it, or, polygamy, as, critics, call, it, is, biblically, authorized, under, heavy, pressure, utah, would, not, be, accepted, as, a, state, if, polygamy, was, practiced, the, church, formally, and, publicly, renounced, the, practice, in, 1890, utah, s, statehood, soon, followed, however, plural, marriage, remains, a, controversial, and, divisive, issue, as, despite, the, official, renunciation, of, 1890, it, still, has, sympathizers, defenders, and, semi, secret, practitioners, within, mormonism, though, not, within, the, lds, church, more, recent, criticism, has, concerned, questions, of, historical, revisionism, homophobia, racism, sexist, policies, inadequate, financial, disclosure, and, the, historical, authenticity, of, the, book, of, mormon
