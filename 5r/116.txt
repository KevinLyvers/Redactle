idolatry, is, the, worship, of, a, cult, image, or, idol, as, though, it, were, a, deity, in, abrahamic, religions, namely, judaism, samaritanism, christianity, the, bah, faith, and, islam, idolatry, connotes, the, worship, of, something, or, someone, other, than, the, abrahamic, god, as, if, it, were, god, in, these, monotheistic, religions, idolatry, has, been, considered, as, the, worship, of, false, gods, and, is, forbidden, by, texts, such, as, the, ten, commandments, other, monotheistic, religions, may, apply, similar, rules, for, instance, the, phrase, false, god, is, a, derogatory, term, used, in, abrahamic, religions, to, indicate, cult, images, or, deities, of, non, abrahamic, pagan, religions, as, well, as, other, competing, entities, or, objects, to, which, particular, importance, is, attributed, conversely, followers, of, animistic, and, polytheistic, religions, may, regard, the, gods, of, various, monotheistic, religions, as, false, gods, because, they, do, not, believe, that, any, real, deity, possesses, the, properties, ascribed, by, monotheists, to, their, sole, deity, atheists, who, do, not, believe, in, any, deities, do, not, usually, use, the, term, false, god, even, though, that, would, encompass, all, deities, from, the, atheist, viewpoint, usage, of, this, term, is, generally, limited, to, theists, who, choose, to, worship, some, deity, or, deities, but, not, others, in, many, indian, religions, which, include, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, idols, murti, are, considered, as, symbolism, for, the, absolute, but, not, the, absolute, or, icons, of, spiritual, ideas, or, the, embodiment, of, the, divine, it, is, a, means, to, focus, one, s, religious, pursuits, and, worship, bhakti, in, the, traditional, religions, of, ancient, egypt, greece, rome, africa, asia, the, americas, and, elsewhere, the, reverence, of, cult, images, or, statues, has, been, a, common, practice, since, antiquity, and, cult, images, have, carried, different, meanings, and, significance, in, the, history, of, religion, moreover, the, material, depiction, of, a, deity, or, more, deities, has, always, played, an, eminent, role, in, all, cultures, of, the, world, the, opposition, to, the, use, of, any, icon, or, image, to, represent, ideas, of, reverence, or, worship, is, called, aniconism, the, destruction, of, images, as, icons, of, veneration, is, called, iconoclasm, and, this, has, long, been, accompanied, with, violence, between, religious, groups, that, forbid, idol, worship, and, those, who, have, accepted, icons, images, and, statues, for, veneration, the, definition, of, idolatry, has, been, a, contested, topic, within, abrahamic, religions, with, many, muslims, and, most, protestant, christians, condemning, the, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, practice, of, venerating, the, virgin, mary, in, many, churches, as, a, form, of, idolatry, the, history, of, religions, has, been, marked, with, accusations, and, denials, of, idolatry, these, accusations, have, considered, statues, and, images, to, be, devoid, of, symbolism, alternatively, the, topic, of, idolatry, has, been, a, source, of, disagreements, between, many, religions, or, within, denominations, of, various, religions, with, the, presumption, that, icons, of, one, s, own, religious, practices, have, meaningful, symbolism, while, another, person, s, different, religious, practices, do, not, the, term, idolatry, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, word, eidololatria, which, itself, is, a, compound, of, two, words, eidolon, image, idol, and, latreia, worship, related, to, the, word, eidololatria, thus, means, worship, of, idols, which, in, latin, appears, first, as, idololatria, then, in, vulgar, latin, as, idolatria, therefrom, it, appears, in, 12th, century, old, french, as, idolatrie, which, for, the, first, time, in, mid, 13th, century, english, appears, as, idolatry, although, the, greek, appears, to, be, a, loan, translation, of, the, hebrew, phrase, avodat, elilim, which, is, attested, in, rabbinic, literature, e, g, bchul, 13b, bar, the, greek, term, itself, is, not, found, in, the, septuagint, philo, josephus, or, in, other, hellenistic, jewish, writings, the, original, term, used, in, early, rabbinic, writings, is, oved, avodah, zarah, aaz, worship, in, strange, service, or, pagan, while, avodat, kochavim, umazalot, akum, worship, of, planets, and, constellations, is, not, found, in, its, early, manuscripts, the, later, jews, used, the, term, avodah, zarah, meaning, foreign, worship, idolatry, has, also, been, called, idolism, iconolatry, or, idolodulia, in, historic, literature, the, earliest, so, called, venus, figurines, have, been, dated, to, the, prehistoric, upper, paleolithic, era, 35, 40, ka, onwards, archaeological, evidence, from, the, islands, of, the, aegean, sea, have, yielded, neolithic, era, cycladic, figures, from, 4th, and, 3rd, millennium, bc, idols, in, namaste, posture, from, indus, valley, civilization, sites, from, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, and, much, older, petroglyphs, around, the, world, show, humans, began, producing, sophisticated, images, however, because, of, a, lack, of, historic, texts, describing, these, it, is, unclear, what, if, any, connection, with, religious, beliefs, these, figures, had, or, whether, they, had, other, meaning, and, uses, even, as, toys, the, earliest, historic, records, confirming, cult, images, are, from, the, ancient, egyptian, civilization, thereafter, related, to, the, greek, civilization, by, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, two, broad, forms, of, cult, image, appear, in, one, images, are, zoomorphic, god, in, the, image, of, animal, or, animal, human, fusion, and, in, another, anthropomorphic, god, in, the, image, of, man, the, former, is, more, commonly, found, in, ancient, egypt, influenced, beliefs, while, the, anthropomorphic, images, are, more, commonly, found, in, indo, european, cultures, symbols, of, nature, useful, animals, or, feared, animals, may, also, be, included, by, both, the, stelae, from, 4, 000, to, 2, 500, bc, period, discovered, in, france, ireland, through, ukraine, and, in, central, asia, through, south, asia, suggest, that, the, ancient, anthropomorphic, figures, included, zoomorphic, motifs, in, nordic, and, indian, subcontinent, bovine, cow, ox, gwdus, g, ou, motifs, or, statues, for, example, were, common, in, ireland, iconic, images, included, pigs, the, ancient, egyptian, religion, was, polytheistic, with, large, cult, images, that, were, either, animals, or, included, animal, parts, ancient, greek, civilization, preferred, human, forms, with, idealized, proportions, for, divine, representation, the, canaanites, of, west, asia, incorporated, a, golden, calf, into, their, pantheon, the, ancient, philosophy, and, practices, of, the, greeks, thereafter, romans, were, imbued, with, polytheistic, idolatry, they, debate, what, is, an, image, and, if, the, use, of, image, is, appropriate, to, plato, images, can, be, a, remedy, or, poison, to, the, human, experience, to, aristotle, states, paul, kugler, an, image, is, an, appropriate, mental, intermediary, that, bridges, between, the, inner, world, of, the, mind, and, the, outer, world, of, material, reality, the, image, is, a, vehicle, between, sensation, and, reason, idols, are, useful, psychological, catalysts, they, reflect, sense, data, and, pre, existing, inner, feelings, they, are, neither, the, origins, nor, the, destinations, of, thought, but, the, intermediary, in, the, human, inner, journey, fervid, opposition, to, the, idolatry, of, the, greeks, and, romans, was, of, early, christianity, and, later, islam, as, evidenced, by, the, widespread, desecration, and, defacement, of, ancient, greek, and, roman, sculptures, that, have, survived, into, the, modern, era, judaism, prohibits, any, form, of, idolatry, even, if, they, are, used, to, worship, the, one, god, of, judaism, as, occurred, during, the, sin, of, the, golden, calf, according, to, the, second, word, of, the, decalogue, thou, shalt, not, make, unto, thee, any, graven, image, the, worship, of, foreign, gods, in, any, form, or, through, icons, is, not, allowed, many, jewish, scholars, such, as, rabbi, saadia, gaon, rabbi, bahya, ibn, paquda, and, rabbi, yehuda, halevi, have, elaborated, on, the, issues, of, idolatry, one, of, the, oft, cited, discussions, is, the, commentary, of, rabbi, moshe, ben, maimon, maimonides, on, idolatry, according, to, the, maimonidean, interpretation, idolatry, in, itself, is, not, a, fundamental, sin, but, the, grave, sin, is, the, denial, of, god, s, omnipresence, that, occurs, with, the, belief, that, god, can, be, corporeal, in, the, jewish, belief, the, only, image, of, god, is, man, one, who, lives, and, thinks, god, has, no, visible, shape, and, it, is, absurd, to, make, or, worship, images, instead, man, must, worship, the, invisible, god, alone, the, commandments, in, the, hebrew, bible, against, idolatry, forbade, the, practices, and, gods, of, ancient, akkad, mesopotamia, and, egypt, the, hebrew, bible, states, that, god, has, no, shape, or, form, is, utterly, incomparable, is, everywhere, and, cannot, be, represented, in, a, physical, form, of, an, idol, biblical, scholars, have, historically, focused, on, the, textual, evidence, to, construct, the, history, of, idolatry, in, judaism, a, scholarship, that, post, modern, scholars, have, increasingly, begun, deconstructing, this, biblical, polemics, states, naomi, janowitz, a, professor, of, religious, studies, has, distorted, the, reality, of, israelite, religious, practices, and, the, historic, use, of, images, in, judaism, the, direct, material, evidence, is, more, reliable, such, as, that, from, the, archaeological, sites, and, this, suggests, that, the, jewish, religious, practices, have, been, far, more, complex, than, what, biblical, polemics, suggest, judaism, included, images, and, cultic, statues, in, the, first, temple, period, the, second, temple, period, late, antiquity, 2nd, to, 8th, century, ce, and, thereafter, nonetheless, these, sorts, of, evidence, may, be, simply, descriptive, of, ancient, israelite, practices, in, some, possibly, deviant, circles, but, cannot, tell, us, anything, about, the, mainstream, religion, of, the, bible, which, proscribes, idolatry, the, history, of, jewish, religious, practice, has, included, cult, images, and, figurines, made, of, ivory, terracotta, faience, and, seals, as, more, material, evidence, emerged, one, proposal, has, been, that, judaism, oscillated, between, idolatry, and, iconoclasm, however, the, dating, of, the, objects, and, texts, suggest, that, the, two, theologies, and, liturgical, practices, existed, simultaneously, the, claimed, rejection, of, idolatry, because, of, monotheism, found, in, jewish, literature, and, therefrom, in, biblical, christian, literature, states, janowitz, has, been, unreal, abstraction, and, flawed, construction, of, the, actual, history, the, material, evidence, of, images, statues, and, figurines, taken, together, with, the, textual, description, of, cherub, and, wine, standing, for, blood, for, example, suggests, that, symbolism, making, religious, images, icon, and, index, has, been, integral, part, of, judaism, every, religion, has, some, objects, that, represent, the, divine, and, stand, for, something, in, the, mind, of, the, faithful, and, judaism, too, has, had, its, holy, objects, and, symbols, such, as, the, menorah, ideas, on, idolatry, in, christianity, are, based, on, the, first, of, ten, commandments, you, shall, have, no, other, gods, before, me, this, is, expressed, in, the, bible, in, exodus, 20, 3, matthew, 4, 10, luke, 4, 8, and, elsewhere, e, g, ye, shall, make, you, no, idols, nor, graven, image, neither, rear, you, up, a, standing, image, neither, shall, ye, set, up, any, image, of, stone, in, your, land, to, bow, down, unto, it, for, i, am, the, lord, your, god, ye, shall, keep, my, sabbaths, and, reverence, my, sanctuary, the, christian, view, of, idolatry, may, generally, be, divided, into, two, general, categories, the, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, view, which, accepts, the, use, of, religious, images, and, the, views, of, many, protestant, churches, that, considerably, restrict, their, use, however, many, protestants, have, used, the, image, of, the, cross, as, a, symbol, the, catholic, church, and, the, orthodox, church, have, traditionally, defended, the, use, of, icons, the, debate, on, what, images, signify, and, whether, reverence, with, the, help, of, icons, in, church, is, equivalent, to, idolatry, has, lasted, for, many, centuries, particularly, from, the, 7th, century, until, the, reformation, in, the, 16th, century, these, debates, have, supported, the, inclusion, of, icons, of, jesus, christ, the, virgin, mary, and, the, apostles, the, iconography, expressed, in, stained, glass, regional, saints, and, other, symbols, of, christian, faith, it, has, also, supported, the, practices, such, as, the, catholic, mass, burning, of, candles, before, pictures, christmas, decorations, and, celebrations, and, festive, or, memorial, processions, with, statues, of, religious, significance, to, christianity, st, john, of, damascus, in, his, on, the, divine, image, defended, the, use, of, icons, and, images, in, direct, response, to, the, byzantine, iconoclasm, that, began, widespread, destruction, of, religious, images, in, the, 8th, century, with, support, from, emperor, leo, iii, and, continued, by, his, successor, constantine, v, during, a, period, of, religious, war, with, the, invading, umayyads, john, of, damascus, wrote, i, venture, to, draw, an, image, of, the, invisible, god, not, as, invisible, but, as, having, become, visible, for, our, sakes, through, flesh, and, blood, adding, that, images, are, expressions, for, remembrance, either, of, wonder, or, an, honor, or, dishonor, or, good, or, evil, and, that, a, book, is, also, a, written, image, in, another, form, he, defended, the, religious, use, of, images, based, on, the, christian, doctrine, of, jesus, as, an, incarnation, st, john, the, evangelist, cited, john, 1, 14, stating, that, the, word, became, flesh, indicates, that, the, invisible, god, became, visible, that, god, s, glory, manifested, in, god, s, one, and, only, son, as, jesus, christ, and, therefore, god, chose, to, make, the, invisible, into, a, visible, form, the, spiritual, incarnated, into, the, material, form, the, early, defense, of, images, included, exegesis, of, old, and, new, testament, evidence, for, the, use, of, religious, images, is, found, in, early, christian, art, and, documentary, records, for, example, the, veneration, of, the, tombs, and, statues, of, martyrs, was, common, among, early, christian, communities, in, 397, st, augustine, of, hippo, in, his, confessions, 6, 2, 2, tells, the, story, of, his, mother, making, offerings, for, the, tombs, of, martyrs, and, the, oratories, built, in, the, memory, of, the, saints, images, function, as, the, bible, for, the, illiterate, and, incite, people, to, piety, and, virtue, pope, gregory, i, 7th, century, the, catholic, defense, mentions, textual, evidence, of, external, acts, of, honor, towards, icons, arguing, that, there, are, a, difference, between, adoration, and, veneration, and, that, the, veneration, shown, to, icons, differs, entirely, from, the, adoration, of, god, citing, the, old, testament, these, arguments, present, examples, of, forms, of, veneration, such, as, in, genesis, 33, 3, with, the, argument, that, adoration, is, one, thing, and, that, which, is, offered, in, order, to, venerate, something, of, great, excellence, is, another, these, arguments, assert, the, honor, given, to, the, image, is, transferred, to, its, prototype, and, that, venerating, an, image, of, christ, does, not, terminate, at, the, image, itself, the, material, of, the, image, is, not, the, object, of, worship, rather, it, goes, beyond, the, image, to, the, prototype, according, to, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, the, christian, veneration, of, images, is, not, contrary, to, the, first, commandment, which, proscribes, idols, indeed, the, honor, rendered, to, an, image, passes, to, its, prototype, and, whoever, venerates, an, image, venerates, the, person, portrayed, in, it, the, honor, paid, to, sacred, images, is, a, respectful, veneration, not, the, adoration, due, to, god, alone, religious, worship, is, not, directed, to, images, in, themselves, considered, as, mere, things, but, under, their, distinctive, aspect, as, images, leading, us, on, to, god, incarnate, the, movement, toward, the, image, does, not, terminate, in, it, as, image, but, tends, toward, that, whose, image, it, is, it, also, points, out, the, following, idolatry, not, only, refers, to, false, pagan, worship, it, remains, a, constant, temptation, to, faith, idolatry, consists, in, divinizing, what, is, not, god, man, commits, idolatry, whenever, he, honors, and, reveres, a, creature, in, place, of, god, whether, this, be, gods, or, demons, for, example, satanism, power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the, state, money, etc, the, manufacture, of, images, of, jesus, the, virgin, mary, and, christian, saints, along, with, prayers, directed, to, these, has, been, widespread, among, the, catholic, faithful, the, eastern, orthodox, church, has, differentiated, between, latria, and, dulia, a, latria, is, the, worship, due, god, and, latria, to, anyone, or, anything, other, than, god, is, doctrinally, forbidden, by, the, orthodox, church, however, dulia, has, been, defined, as, veneration, of, religious, images, statues, or, icons, which, is, not, only, allowed, but, obligatory, this, distinction, was, discussed, by, thomas, aquinas, in, section, 3, 25, of, summa, theologiae, in, orthodox, apologetic, literature, the, proper, and, improper, use, of, images, is, extensively, discussed, exegetical, orthodox, literature, points, to, icons, and, the, manufacture, by, moses, under, god, s, commandment, of, the, bronze, snake, in, numbers, 21, 9, which, had, the, grace, and, power, of, god, to, heal, those, bitten, by, real, snakes, similarly, the, ark, of, the, covenant, was, cited, as, evidence, of, the, ritual, object, above, which, yahweh, was, present, veneration, of, icons, through, proskynesis, was, codified, in, 787, ad, by, the, seventh, ecumenical, council, this, was, triggered, by, the, byzantine, iconoclasm, controversy, that, followed, raging, christian, muslim, wars, and, a, period, of, iconoclasm, in, west, asia, the, defense, of, images, and, the, role, of, the, syrian, scholar, john, of, damascus, was, pivotal, during, this, period, the, eastern, orthodox, church, has, ever, since, celebrated, the, use, of, icons, and, images, eastern, rite, catholics, also, accepts, icons, in, their, divine, liturgy, the, idolatry, debate, has, been, one, of, the, defining, differences, between, papal, catholicism, and, anti, papal, protestantism, the, anti, papal, writers, have, prominently, questioned, the, worship, practices, and, images, supported, by, catholics, with, many, protestant, scholars, listing, it, as, the, one, religious, error, larger, than, all, others, the, sub, list, of, erring, practices, have, included, among, other, things, the, veneration, of, virgin, mary, the, catholic, mass, the, invocation, of, saints, and, the, reverence, expected, for, and, expressed, to, pope, himself, the, charges, of, supposed, idolatry, against, the, roman, catholics, were, leveled, by, a, diverse, group, of, protestants, from, anglicans, to, calvinists, in, geneva, protestants, did, not, abandon, all, icons, and, symbols, of, christianity, they, typically, avoid, the, use, of, images, except, the, cross, in, any, context, suggestive, of, veneration, the, cross, remained, their, central, icon, technically, both, major, branches, of, christianity, have, had, their, icons, states, carlos, eire, a, professor, of, religious, studies, and, history, but, its, meaning, has, been, different, to, each, and, one, man, s, devotion, was, another, man, s, idolatry, this, was, particularly, true, not, only, in, the, intra, christian, debate, states, eire, but, also, when, soldiers, of, catholic, kings, replaced, horrible, aztec, idols, in, the, american, colonies, with, beautiful, crosses, and, images, of, mary, and, the, saints, protestants, often, accuse, catholics, of, idolatry, iconolatry, and, even, paganism, in, the, protestant, reformation, such, language, was, common, to, all, protestants, in, some, cases, such, as, the, puritan, groups, denounced, all, forms, of, religious, objects, regardless, of, whether, it, was, a, statue, or, sculpture, or, image, including, the, christian, cross, the, waldensians, were, accused, of, idolatry, by, inquisitors, the, body, of, christ, on, the, cross, is, an, ancient, symbol, used, within, the, catholic, eastern, orthodox, anglican, and, lutheran, churches, in, contrast, with, some, protestant, groups, which, use, only, a, simple, cross, in, judaism, the, reverence, to, the, icon, of, christ, in, the, form, of, cross, has, been, seen, as, idolatry, however, some, jewish, scholars, disagree, and, consider, christianity, to, be, based, on, jewish, belief, and, not, truly, idolatrous, in, islamic, sources, the, concept, of, shirk, triliteral, root, sh, r, k, can, refer, to, idolatry, though, it, is, most, widely, used, to, denote, association, of, partners, with, god, the, concept, of, kufr, k, f, r, can, also, include, idolatry, among, other, forms, of, disbelief, the, one, who, practices, shirk, is, called, mushrik, plural, mushrikun, in, the, islamic, scriptures, the, quran, forbids, idolatry, over, 500, mentions, of, kufr, and, shirk, are, found, in, the, quran, and, both, concepts, are, strongly, forbidden, the, islamic, concept, of, idolatry, extends, beyond, polytheism, and, includes, some, christians, and, jews, as, mu, irk, n, idolaters, and, kafirun, infidels, for, example, those, who, say, allah, is, the, messiah, son, of, mary, have, certainly, fallen, into, disbelief, the, messiah, himself, said, o, children, of, israel, worship, allah, my, lord, and, your, lord, whoever, associates, others, with, allah, in, worship, will, surely, be, forbidden, paradise, by, allah, their, home, will, be, the, fire, and, the, wrongdoers, will, have, no, helpers, shia, classical, theology, differs, in, the, concept, of, shirk, according, to, twelver, theologians, the, attributes, and, names, of, god, have, no, independent, and, hypostatic, existence, apart, from, the, being, and, essence, of, god, any, suggestion, of, these, attributes, and, names, being, conceived, of, as, separate, is, thought, to, entail, polytheism, it, would, be, even, incorrect, to, say, god, knows, by, his, knowledge, which, is, in, his, essence, but, god, knows, by, his, knowledge, which, is, his, essence, also, god, has, no, physical, form, and, he, is, insensible, the, border, between, theoretical, tawhid, and, shirk, is, to, know, that, every, reality, and, being, in, its, essence, attributes, and, action, are, from, him, from, him, ness, it, is, tawhid, every, supernatural, action, of, the, prophets, is, by, god, s, permission, as, quran, points, to, it, the, border, between, the, tawhid, and, shirk, in, practice, is, to, assume, something, as, an, end, in, itself, independent, from, god, not, as, a, road, to, god, to, him, ness, ismailis, go, deeper, into, the, definition, of, shirk, declaring, they, don, t, recognize, any, sort, of, ground, of, being, by, the, esoteric, potential, to, have, intuitive, knowledge, of, the, human, being, hence, most, shias, have, no, problem, with, religious, symbols, and, artworks, and, with, reverence, for, walis, ras, ls, and, imams, islam, strongly, prohibits, all, form, of, idolatry, which, is, part, of, the, sin, of, shirk, arabic, irk, comes, from, the, arabic, root, r, k, with, the, general, meaning, of, to, share, in, the, context, of, the, qur, an, the, particular, sense, of, sharing, as, an, equal, partner, is, usually, understood, as, attributing, a, partner, to, allah, shirk, is, often, translated, as, idolatry, and, polytheism, in, the, qur, an, shirk, and, the, related, word, plural, stem, iv, active, participle, mu, rik, n, those, who, commit, shirk, refers, to, the, enemies, of, islam, as, in, verse, 9, 1, 15, within, islam, shirk, is, sin, that, can, only, be, forgiven, if, the, person, who, commits, it, asks, god, for, forgiveness, if, the, person, who, committed, it, dies, without, repenting, god, may, forgive, any, sin, except, for, committing, shirk, in, practice, especially, among, strict, conservative, interpretations, of, islam, the, term, has, been, greatly, extended, and, means, deification, of, anyone, or, anything, other, than, the, singular, god, in, salafi, wahhabi, interpretation, it, may, be, used, very, widely, to, describe, behaviour, that, does, not, literally, constitute, worship, including, use, of, images, of, sentient, beings, building, a, structure, over, a, grave, associating, partners, with, god, giving, his, characteristics, to, others, beside, him, or, not, believing, in, his, characteristics, 19th, century, wahhabis, regarded, idolatry, punishable, with, the, death, penalty, a, practice, that, was, hitherto, unknown, in, islam, however, classical, orthodox, sunni, thought, used, to, be, rich, in, relics, and, saint, veneration, as, well, as, pilgrimage, to, their, shrines, ibn, taymiyya, a, medieval, theologian, that, influenced, modern, days, salafists, was, put, in, prison, for, his, negation, of, veneration, of, relics, and, saints, as, well, as, pilgrimage, to, shrines, which, was, considered, unorthodox, by, his, contemporary, theologians, according, to, islamic, tradition, over, the, millennia, after, ishmael, s, death, his, progeny, and, the, local, tribes, who, settled, around, the, oasis, of, zam, zam, gradually, turned, to, polytheism, and, idolatry, several, idols, were, placed, within, the, kaaba, representing, deities, of, different, aspects, of, nature, and, different, tribes, several, heretical, rituals, were, adopted, in, the, pilgrimage, hajj, including, doing, naked, circumambulation, in, her, book, islam, a, short, history, karen, armstrong, asserts, that, the, kaaba, was, officially, dedicated, to, hubal, a, nabatean, deity, and, contained, 360, idols, that, probably, represented, the, days, of, the, year, but, by, muhammad, s, day, it, seems, that, the, kaaba, was, venerated, as, the, shrine, of, allah, the, high, god, allah, was, never, represented, by, an, idol, once, a, year, tribes, from, all, around, the, arabian, peninsula, whether, christian, or, pagan, would, converge, on, mecca, to, perform, the, hajj, marking, the, widespread, conviction, that, allah, was, the, same, deity, worshipped, by, monotheists, guillaume, in, his, translation, of, ibn, ishaq, an, early, biographer, of, muhammad, says, the, ka, aba, might, have, been, itself, addressed, using, a, feminine, grammatical, form, by, the, quraysh, circumambulation, was, often, performed, naked, by, men, and, almost, naked, by, women, it, is, disputed, whether, al, lat, and, hubal, were, the, same, deity, or, different, per, a, hypothesis, by, uri, rubin, and, christian, robin, hubal, was, only, venerated, by, quraysh, and, the, kaaba, was, first, dedicated, to, al, lat, a, supreme, god, of, individuals, belonging, to, different, tribes, while, the, pantheon, of, the, gods, of, quraysh, was, installed, in, kaaba, after, they, conquered, mecca, a, century, before, muhammad, s, time, the, first, attested, date, in, peer, reviewed, academic, literature, for, the, worship, of, murti, sanskrit, or, vigraha, sanskrit, in, india, is, not, clear, as, different, sources, have, different, opinions, and, interpretations, however, the, indus, valley, civilization, circa, 2500, 1500, bce, may, have, produced, some, of, the, earliest, murtis, or, vigrahas, in, india, as, evidenced, by, various, terracotta, and, bronze, figurines, found, in, the, archaeological, sites, some, of, these, figurines, have, been, interpreted, as, representations, of, deities, such, as, the, so, called, pashupati, seal, which, depicts, a, horned, figure, surrounded, by, animals, and, possibly, identified, with, shiva, another, example, is, the, bronze, statuette, of, a, dancing, girl, which, some, scholars, have, associated, with, parvati, or, shakti, however, these, interpretations, are, not, universally, accepted, and, some, scholars, have, argued, that, the, indus, valley, civilization, did, not, practice, murti, or, vigraha, worship, but, rather, used, symbols, and, signs, to, express, their, religious, beliefs, the, vedic, period, circa, 1500, 500, bce, is, traditionally, considered, as, the, origin, of, hinduism, proper, but, it, also, did, not, emphasize, murti, or, vigraha, worship, as, the, vedic, religion, was, mainly, focused, on, fire, sacrifices, and, hymns, to, various, gods, and, goddesses, however, some, vedic, texts, do, mention, the, use, of, clay, or, wooden, images, for, ritual, purposes, such, as, the, shatapatha, brahmana, circa, 8th, 6th, century, bce, which, describes, how, a, clay, image, of, prajapati, the, creator, god, was, made, and, consecrated, for, the, agnicayana, ritual, another, example, is, the, aitareya, brahmana, circa, 8th, 6th, century, bce, which, mentions, how, a, wooden, image, of, varuna, the, god, of, water, and, law, was, installed, in, a, temple, and, worshipped, by, the, king, these, examples, suggest, that, murti, or, vigraha, worship, was, not, unknown, in, the, vedic, period, but, it, was, not, widespread, nor, dominant, the, post, vedic, period, circa, 500, bce, 300, ce, witnessed, the, emergence, and, development, of, various, religious, movements, and, schools, such, as, buddhism, jainism, shaivism, vaishnavism, shaktism, and, others, this, period, also, saw, the, rise, of, murti, or, vigraha, worship, as, a, prominent, feature, of, hinduism, as, evidenced, by, various, literary, and, archaeological, sources, for, instance, the, ramayana, circa, 5th, 4th, century, bce, and, the, mahabharata, circa, 4th, 3rd, century, bce, contain, several, references, to, murti, or, vigraha, worship, such, as, rama, worshipping, a, shiva, linga, at, rameshwaram, or, krishna, installing, an, image, of, vishnu, at, dwarka, another, example, is, the, buddhist, text, lalitavistara, sutra, circa, 3rd, century, bce, 3rd, century, ce, which, mentions, how, buddha, s, mother, maya, dreamt, of, a, white, elephant, entering, her, womb, and, how, king, suddhodana, made, an, image, of, this, elephant, and, worshipped, it, moreover, many, stone, and, metal, sculptures, of, various, deities, and, saints, have, been, found, from, this, period, onwards, such, as, the, famous, pancha, rathas, at, mahabalipuram, circa, 7th, century, ce, which, depict, five, chariots, dedicated, to, different, gods, and, goddesses, the, oldest, forms, of, the, ancient, religions, of, india, apparently, made, no, use, of, cult, images, while, the, vedic, literature, leading, up, to, hinduism, is, extensive, in, the, form, of, samhitas, brahmanas, aranyakas, and, upanishads, and, has, been, dated, to, have, been, composed, over, a, period, of, centuries, 1200, bc, to, 200, bc, historical, vedic, religion, appears, not, to, have, used, cult, images, up, to, around, 500, bc, at, least, the, early, buddhist, and, jain, pre, 200, bc, traditions, suggest, no, evidence, of, idolatry, the, vedic, literature, mentions, many, gods, and, goddesses, as, well, as, the, use, of, homa, votive, ritual, using, fire, but, it, does, not, mention, images, or, their, worship, the, ancient, buddhist, hindu, and, jaina, texts, discuss, the, nature, of, existence, whether, there, is, or, is, not, a, creator, deity, such, as, in, the, nasadiya, sukta, of, the, rigveda, they, describe, meditation, they, recommend, the, pursuit, of, simple, monastic, life, and, self, knowledge, they, debate, the, nature, of, absolute, reality, as, brahman, or, nyat, yet, the, ancient, indian, texts, mention, no, use, of, images, indologists, such, as, the, max, muller, jan, gonda, pandurang, vaman, kane, ramchandra, narayan, dandekar, horace, hayman, wilson, stephanie, jamison, and, other, scholars, state, that, there, is, no, evidence, for, icons, or, images, representing, god, s, in, the, ancient, religions, of, india, use, of, cult, images, developed, among, the, indian, religions, later, perhaps, first, in, buddhism, where, large, images, of, the, buddha, appear, by, the, 1st, century, ad, according, to, john, grimes, a, professor, of, indian, philosophy, indian, thought, denied, even, dogmatic, idolatry, of, its, scriptures, everything, has, been, left, to, challenge, arguments, and, enquiry, with, the, medieval, indian, scholar, v, caspati, mi, ra, stating, that, not, all, scripture, is, authoritative, only, scripture, which, reveals, the, identity, of, the, individual, self, and, the, supreme, self, as, the, non, dual, absolute, according, to, eric, reinders, icons, and, idolatry, have, been, an, integral, part, of, buddhism, throughout, its, later, history, buddhists, from, korea, to, vietnam, thailand, to, tibet, central, asia, to, south, asia, have, long, produced, temples, and, idols, altars, and, malas, relics, to, amulets, images, to, ritual, implements, the, images, or, relics, of, buddha, are, found, in, all, buddhist, traditions, but, they, also, feature, gods, and, goddesses, such, as, those, in, tibetan, buddhism, bhakti, called, bhatti, in, pali, has, been, a, common, practice, in, theravada, buddhism, where, offerings, and, group, prayers, are, made, to, cetiya, and, particularly, images, of, buddha, karel, werner, notes, that, bhakti, has, been, a, significant, practice, in, theravada, buddhism, and, states, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, deep, devotion, or, bhakti, bhatti, does, exist, in, buddhism, and, that, it, had, its, beginnings, in, the, earliest, days, according, to, peter, harvey, a, professor, of, buddhist, studies, buddha, idols, and, idolatry, spread, into, northwest, indian, subcontinent, now, pakistan, and, afghanistan, and, into, central, asia, with, buddhist, silk, road, merchants, the, hindu, rulers, of, different, indian, dynasties, patronized, both, buddhism, and, hinduism, from, 4th, to, 9th, century, building, buddhist, icons, and, cave, temples, such, as, the, ajanta, caves, and, ellora, caves, which, featured, buddha, idols, from, the, 10th, century, states, harvey, the, raids, into, northwestern, parts, of, south, asia, by, muslim, turks, destroyed, buddhist, idols, given, their, religious, dislike, for, idolatry, the, iconoclasm, was, so, linked, to, buddhism, that, the, islamic, texts, of, this, era, in, india, called, all, idols, as, budd, the, desecration, of, idols, in, cave, temples, continued, through, the, 17th, century, states, geri, malandra, from, the, offense, of, the, graphic, anthropomorphic, imagery, of, hindu, and, buddhist, shrines, in, east, asia, and, southeast, asia, worship, in, buddhist, temples, with, the, aid, of, icons, and, sacred, objects, has, been, historic, in, japanese, buddhism, for, example, butsugu, sacred, objects, have, been, integral, to, the, worship, of, the, buddha, kuyo, and, such, idolatry, considered, a, part, of, the, process, of, realizing, one, s, buddha, nature, this, process, is, more, than, meditation, it, has, traditionally, included, devotional, rituals, butsudo, aided, by, the, buddhist, clergy, these, practices, are, also, found, in, korea, and, china, in, hinduism, an, icon, image, or, statue, is, called, murti, or, pratima, major, hindu, traditions, such, as, vaishnavism, shaivism, shaktism, and, smartism, favor, the, use, of, a, murti, idol, these, traditions, suggest, that, it, is, easier, to, dedicate, time, and, focus, on, spirituality, through, anthropomorphic, or, non, anthropomorphic, icons, the, bhagavad, gita, a, hindu, scripture, in, verse, 12, 5, states, that, only, a, few, have, the, time, and, mind, to, ponder, and, fix, on, the, unmanifested, absolute, abstract, formless, brahman, and, it, is, much, easier, to, focus, on, qualities, virtues, aspects, of, a, manifested, representation, of, god, through, one, s, senses, emotions, and, heart, because, the, way, human, beings, naturally, are, a, murti, in, hinduism, states, jeaneane, fowler, a, professor, of, religious, studies, specializing, on, indian, religions, is, itself, not, god, it, is, an, image, of, god, and, thus, a, symbol, and, representation, a, murti, is, a, form, and, manifestation, states, fowler, of, the, formless, absolute, thus, a, literal, translation, of, murti, as, idol, is, incorrect, when, idol, is, understood, as, superstitious, end, in, itself, just, like, the, photograph, of, a, person, is, not, the, real, person, a, murti, is, an, image, in, hinduism, but, not, the, real, thing, but, in, both, cases, the, image, reminds, of, something, of, emotional, and, real, value, to, the, viewer, when, a, person, worships, a, murti, it, is, assumed, to, be, a, manifestation, of, the, essence, or, spirit, of, the, deity, the, worshipper, s, spiritual, ideas, and, needs, are, meditated, through, it, yet, the, idea, of, ultimate, reality, called, brahman, in, hinduism, is, not, confined, in, it, devotional, bhakti, movement, practices, centered, on, cultivating, a, deep, and, personal, bond, of, love, with, god, often, expressed, and, facilitated, with, one, or, more, murti, and, includes, individual, or, community, hymns, japa, or, singing, bhajan, kirtana, or, arati, acts, of, devotion, in, major, temples, particularly, are, structured, on, treating, the, murti, as, the, manifestation, of, a, revered, guest, and, the, daily, routine, can, include, awakening, the, murti, in, the, morning, and, making, sure, that, it, is, washed, dressed, and, garlanded, in, vaishnavism, the, building, of, a, temple, for, the, murti, is, considered, an, act, of, devotion, but, non, murti, symbolism, is, also, common, wherein, the, aromatic, tulasi, plant, or, shaligrama, is, an, aniconic, reminder, of, the, spiritualism, in, vishnu, in, the, shaivism, tradition, of, hinduism, shiva, may, be, represented, as, a, masculine, idol, or, half, man, half, woman, ardhanarishvara, form, in, an, anicon, linga, yoni, form, the, worship, rituals, associated, with, the, murti, correspond, to, ancient, cultural, practices, for, a, beloved, guest, and, the, murti, is, welcomed, taken, care, of, and, then, requested, to, retire, christopher, john, fuller, states, that, an, image, in, hinduism, cannot, be, equated, with, a, deity, and, the, object, of, worship, is, the, divine, whose, power, is, inside, the, image, and, the, image, is, not, the, object, of, worship, itself, hindus, believe, everything, is, worthy, of, worship, as, it, contains, divine, energy, the, idols, are, neither, random, nor, intended, as, superstitious, objects, rather, they, are, designed, with, embedded, symbolism, and, iconographic, rules, which, sets, the, style, proportions, the, colors, the, nature, of, items, the, images, carry, their, mudra, and, the, legends, associated, with, the, deity, the, v, stus, tra, upani, ad, states, that, the, aim, of, the, murti, art, is, to, inspire, a, devotee, towards, contemplating, the, ultimate, supreme, principle, brahman, this, text, adds, abridged, from, the, contemplation, of, images, grows, delight, from, delight, faith, from, faith, steadfast, devotion, through, such, devotion, arises, that, higher, understanding, par, vidy, that, is, the, royal, road, to, moksha, without, the, guidance, of, images, the, mind, of, the, devotee, may, go, ashtray, and,

rishis, of, gigantic, drama, of, cosmic, powers, in, eternal, conflict, which, the, sthapakas, silpins, murti, and, temple, artists, drew, the, subject, matter, for, their, work, some, hindu, movements, founded, during, the, colonial, era, such, as, the, arya, samaj, and, satya, mahima, dharma, reject, idolatry, devotional, idolatry, has, been, a, prevalent, ancient, practice, in, various, jaina, sects, wherein, learned, tirthankara, jina, and, human, gurus, have, been, venerated, with, offerings, songs, and, rat, prayers, like, other, major, indian, religions, jainism, has, premised, its, spiritual, practices, on, the, belief, that, all, knowledge, is, inevitably, mediated, by, images, and, human, beings, discover, learn, and, know, what, is, to, be, known, through, names, images, and, representations, thus, idolatry, has, been, a, part, of, the, major, sects, of, jainism, such, as, digambara, and, shvetambara, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, the, idols, and, images, in, jainism, is, from, mathura, and, has, been, dated, to, be, from, the, first, half, of, the, 1st, millennium, ad, the, creation, of, idols, their, consecration, the, inclusion, of, jaina, layperson, in, idols, and, temples, of, jainism, by, the, jaina, monks, has, been, a, historic, practice, however, during, the, iconoclastic, era, of, islamic, rule, between, the, 15th, and, 17th, century, a, lonka, sect, of, jainism, emerged, that, continued, pursuing, their, traditional, spirituality, but, without, the, jaina, arts, images, and, idols, sikhism, is, a, monotheistic, indian, religion, and, sikh, temples, are, devoid, of, idols, and, icons, for, god, yet, sikhism, strongly, encourages, devotion, to, god, some, scholars, call, sikhism, a, bhakti, sect, of, indian, traditions, in, sikhism, nirguni, bhakti, is, emphasised, devotion, to, a, divine, without, gunas, qualities, or, form, but, its, scripture, also, accepts, representations, of, god, with, formless, nirguni, and, with, form, saguni, as, stated, in, adi, granth, 287, sikhism, condemns, worshipping, images, or, statues, as, if, it, were, god, but, have, historically, challenged, the, iconoclastic,

and, religious, studies, concurs, with, awolalu, and, states, that, the, colonial, era, missionaries, who, arrived, in, africa, neither, understood, the, regional, languages, nor, the, african, theology, and, interpreted, the, images, and, ritualism, as, epitome, of, idolatry, projecting, the, iconoclastic, controversies, in, europe, they, grew, up, with, onto, africa, first, with, the, arrival, of, islam, in, africa, then, during, the, christian, colonial, efforts, the, religiously, justified, wars, the, colonial, portrayal, of, idolatry, as, proof, of, savagery, the, destruction,

of, their, christian, sects, triumph, with, fewer, mentions, of, actual, converts, and, baptism, the, term, false, god, is, often, used, throughout, the, abrahamic, scriptures, torah, tanakh, bible,
