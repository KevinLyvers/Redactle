in, many, religious, and, philosophical, traditions, the, soul, is, the, non, material, essence, of, a, person, which, includes, one, s, identity, personality, and, memories, an, immaterial, aspect, or, essence, of, a, living, being, that, is, believed, to, be, able, to, survive, physical, death, the, concept, of, the, soul, is, generally, applied, to, humans, although, it, can, also, be, applied, to, other, living, or, even, non, living, entities, as, in, animism, the, modern, english, noun, soul, is, derived, from, old, english, s, wol, s, wel, the, earliest, attestations, reported, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, are, from, the, 8th, century, in, king, alfred, s, translation, of, de, consolatione, philosophiae, it, is, used, to, refer, to, the, immaterial, spiritual, or, thinking, aspect, of, a, person, as, contrasted, with, the, person, s, physical, body, in, the, vespasian, psalter, 77, 50, it, means, life, or, animate, existence, the, old, english, word, is, cognate, with, other, historical, germanic, terms, for, the, same, idea, including, old, frisian, s, le, s, l, which, could, also, mean, salvation, or, solemn, oath, gothic, saiwala, old, high,

beings, have, immortal, souls, immortality, is, disputed, within, judaism, and, the, concept, of, immortality, was, most, likely, influenced, by, plato, for, example, thomas, aquinas, borrowing, directly, from, aristotle, s, on, the, soul, attributed, soul, anima, to, all, organisms, but, argued, that, only, human, souls, are, immortal, other, religions, most, notably, hinduism, and, jainism, believe, that, all, living, things, from, the, smallest, bacterium, to, the, largest, of, mammals, are, the, souls, themselves, atman, and, jiva, and, have, their, physical, representative, the, body, in, the, world, the, actual, self, is, the, soul, while, the, body, is, only, a, mechanism, to, experience, the, karma, of, that, life, thus, if, one, sees, a, tiger, then, there, is, a, self, conscious, identity, residing, in, it, the, soul, and, a, physical, representative, the, whole, body, of, the, tiger, which, is, observable, in, the, world, many, people, believe, that, non, biological, things, such, as, rivers, and, mountains, also, possess, souls, this, belief, is, called, animism, in, the, ancient, egyptian, religion, an, individual, was, believed, to, be, made, up, of, various, elements, some, physical, and, some, spiritual, similar, ideas, are, found, in, ancient, assyrian, and, babylonian, religion, the, kuttamuwa, stele, a, funeral, stele, for, an, 8th, century, bce, royal, official, from, sam, al, describes, kuttamuwa, requesting, that, his, mourners, commemorate, his, life, and, his, afterlife, with, feasts, for, my, soul, that, is, in, this, stele, it, is, one, of, the, earliest, references, to, a, soul, as, a, separate, entity, from, the, body, the, 800, pound, 360, kg, basalt, stele, is, 3, ft, 0, 91, m, tall, and, 2, ft, 0, 61, m, wide, it, was, uncovered, in, the, third, season, of, excavations, by, the, neubauer, expedition, of, the, oriental, institute, in, chicago, illinois, the, bah, faith, affirms, that, the, soul, is, a, sign, of, god, a, heavenly, gem, whose, reality, the, most, learned, of, men, hath, failed, to, grasp, and, whose, mystery, no, mind, however, acute, can, ever, hope, to, unravel, bah, u, ll, h, stated, that, the, soul, not, only, continues, to, live, after, the, physical, death, of, the, human, body, but, is, in, fact, immortal, heaven, can, be, seen, partly, as, the, soul, s, state, of, nearness, to, god, and, hell, as, a, state, of, remoteness, from, god, each, state, follows, as, a, natural, consequence, of, individual, efforts, or, the, lack, thereof, to, develop, spiritually, bah, u, ll, h, taught, that, individuals, have, no, existence, prior, to, their, life, here, on, earth, and, the, soul, s, evolution, is, always, towards, god, and, away, from, the, material, world, the, traditional, doctrine, in, buddhism, regarding, the, soul, self, or, ego, is, that, it, is, non, existent, as, a, separate, permanent, entity, the, non, existence, of, self, anatman, the, impermanence, of, all, things, anitya, and, the, suffering, dukkha, experienced, by, living, beings, due, to, attachment, to, ideas, of, self, and, permanence, are, central, concepts, in, almost, all, buddhist, schools, the, doctrine, of, buddha, nature, while, sometimes, misinterpreted, as, referring, to, a, true, self, or, soul, of, some, kind, actually, depends, upon, acceptance, of, the, concept, of, anatman, to, be, properly, understood, according, to, some, christian, eschatology, when, people, die, their, souls, will, be, judged, by, god, and, determined, to, go, to, heaven, or, to, hades, awaiting, a, resurrection, the, oldest, existing, branches, of, christianity, the, catholic, church, and, the, eastern, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, adhere, to, this, view, as, well, as, many, protestant, denominations, some, protestant, christians, understand, the, soul, as, life, and, believe, that, the, dead, have, no, conscious, existence, until, after, the, resurrection, this, is, known, as, christian, conditionalism, some, protestant, christians, believe, that, the, souls, and, bodies, of, the, unrighteous, will, be, destroyed, in, hell, rather, than, suffering, eternally, annihilationism, believers, will, inherit, eternal, life, either, in, heaven, or, in, a, kingdom, of, god, on, earth, and, enjoy, eternal, fellowship, with, god, other, christians, reject, the, punishment, of, the, soul, paul, the, apostle, used, psych, and, pneuma, specifically, to, distinguish, between, the, jewish, notions, of, nephesh, and, ruah, meaning, spirit, also, in, the, septuagint, e, g, genesis, 1, 2, spiritus, dei, the, spirit, of, god, christians, generally, believe, in, the, existence, and, eternal, infinite, nature, of, the, soul, the, origin, of, the, soul, has, provided, a, vexing, question, in, christianity, the, major, theories, put, forward, include, soul, creationism, traducianism, and, pre, existence, according, to, soul, creationism, god, creates, each, individual, soul, directly, either, at, the, moment, of, conception, or, at, some, later, time, according, to, traducianism, the, soul, comes, from, the, parents, by, natural, generation, according, to, the, preexistence, theory, the, soul, exists, before, the, moment, of, conception, there, have, been, differing, thoughts, regarding, whether, human, embryos, have, souls, from, conception, or, whether, there, is, a, point, between, conception, and, birth, where, the, fetus, acquires, a, soul, consciousness, and, or, personhood, stances, in, this, question, play, a, role, in, judgments, on, the, morality, of, abortion, some, christians, espouse, a, trichotomic, view, of, humans, which, characterizes, humans, as, consisting, of, a, body, soma, soul, psyche, and, spirit, pneuma, however, the, majority, of, modern, bible, scholars, point, out, how, the, concepts, of, spirit, and, of, soul, are, used, interchangeably, in, many, biblical, passages, and, so, hold, to, dichotomy, the, view, that, each, human, comprises, a, body, and, a, soul, paul, said, that, the, body, wars, against, the, soul, for, the, word, of, god, is, living, and, active, and, sharper, than, any, two, edged, sword, and, piercing, as, far, as, the, division, of, soul, and, spirit, heb, 4, 12, nasb, and, that, i, buffet, my, body, to, keep, it, under, control, according, to, thomas, aquinas, the, soul, is, tota, in, toto, corpore, this, means, that, the, soul, is, entirely, contained, in, every, single, part, of, the, human, body, and, therefore, ubiquitous, and, cannot, be, placed, in, a, single, organ, such, as, heart, or, brain, nor, it, is, separable, from, the, body, except, after, the, body, s, death, in, the, fourth, book, of, de, trinitate, augustine, of, hippo, states, that, the, soul, is, all, in, the, whole, body, and, all, in, any, part, of, it, the, present, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, states, that, refers, to, the, innermost, aspect, of, that, which, is, of, greatest, value, in, that, by, which, most, especially, in, god, s, image, soul, signifies, the, spiritual, principle, in, all, souls, living, and, dead, will, be, judged, by, jesus, christ, when, he, comes, back, to, earth, the, catholic, church, teaches, that, the, existence, of, each, individual, soul, is, dependent, wholly, upon, god, stating, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, affirms, that, the, spiritual, and, immortal, soul, is, created, immediately, by, god, protestants, generally, believe, in, the, soul, s, existence, and, immortality, but, fall, into, two, major, camps, about, what, this, means, in, terms, of, an, afterlife, some, following, john, calvin, believe, that, the, soul, persists, as, consciousness, after, death, others, following, martin, luther, believe, that, the, soul, dies, with, the, body, and, is, unconscious, sleeps, until, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, various, new, religious, movements, deriving, from, adventism, including, christadelphians, seventh, day, adventists, and, jehovah, s, witnesses, similarly, believe, that, the, dead, do, not, possess, a, soul, separate, from, the, body, and, are, unconscious, until, the, resurrection, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, teaches, that, the, spirit, and, body, together, constitute, the, soul, of, man, mankind, stating, the, spirit, and, the, body, are, the, soul, of, man, latter, day, saints, believe, that, the, soul, is, the, union, of, a, pre, existing, god, made, spirit, and, a, temporal, body, which, is, formed, by, physical, conception, on, earth, after, death, the, spirit, continues, to, live, and, progress, in, the, spirit, world, until, the, resurrection, when, it, is, reunited, with, the, body, that, once, housed, it, this, reuniting, of, body, and, spirit, results, in, a, perfect, soul, that, is, immortal, and, eternal, and, capable, of, receiving, a, fulness, of, joy, latter, day, saint, cosmology, also, describes, intelligences, as, the, essence, of, consciousness, or, agency, these, are, co, eternal, with, god, and, animate, the, spirits, the, union, of, a, newly, created, spirit, body, with, an, eternally, existing, intelligence, constitutes, a, spirit, birth, and, justifies, god, s, title, father, of, our, spirits, some, confucian, traditions, contrast, a, spiritual, soul, with, a, corporeal, soul, tman, is, a, sanskrit, word, that, means, inner, self, or, soul, in, hindu, philosophy, especially, in, the, vedanta, school, of, hinduism, tman, is, the, first, principle, the, true, self, of, an, individual, beyond, identification, with, phenomena, the, essence, of, an, individual, in, order, to, attain, liberation, moksha, a, human, being, must, acquire, self, knowledge, atma, jnana, which, is, to, realize, that, one, s, true, self, tman, is, identical, with, the, transcendent, self, brahman, according, to, advaita, vedanta, the, six, orthodox, schools, of, hinduism, believe, that, there, is, tman, self, essence, in, every, being, in, hinduism, and, jainism, a, jiva, sanskrit, j, va, alternative, spelling, jiwa, hindi, j, v, alternative, spelling, jeev, is, a, living, being, or, any, entity, imbued, with, a, life, force, the, concept, of, jiva, in, jainism, is, similar, to, atman, in, hinduism, however, some, hindu, traditions, differentiate, between, the, two, concepts, with, jiva, considered, as, individual, self, while, atman, as, that, which, is, universal, unchanging, self, that, is, present, in, all, living, beings, and, everything, else, as, the, metaphysical, brahman, the, latter, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, jiva, atman, a, soul, in, a, living, body, the, quran, the, holy, book, of, islam, uses, two, words, to, refer, to, the, soul, r, translated, as, spirit, consciousness, pneuma, or, soul, and, nafs, translated, as, self, ego, psyche, or, soul, cognates, of, the, hebrew, ruach, and, nefesh, the, two, terms, are, frequently, used, interchangeably, although, r, is, more, often, used, to, denote, the, divine, spirit, or, the, breath, of, life, while, nafs, designates, one, s, disposition, or, characteristics, in, islamic, philosophy, the, immortal, r, drives, the, mortal, nafs, which, comprises, temporal, desires, and, perceptions, necessary, for, living, several, verses, of, the, quran, that, mention, the, r, h, occur, in, chapters, 17, the, night, journey, and, 39, the, troops, and, they, ask, you, about, the, r, h, say, the, r, h, is, of, the, affair, of, my, lord, and, mankind, has, not, been, given, of, knowledge, except, a, little, and, remember, your, rabb, inside, your, self, allah, takes, the, souls, at, the, time, of, their, death, and, those, that, do, not, die, during, their, sleep, then, he, keeps, those, for, which, he, has, decreed, death, and, releases, the, others, for, a, specified, term, indeed, in, that, are, signs, for, a, people, who, give, thought, in, jainism, every, living, being, from, plant, or, bacterium, to, human, has, a, soul, and, the, concept, forms, the, very, basis, of, jainism, according, to, jainism, there, is, no, beginning, or, end, to, the, existence, of, soul, it, is, eternal, in, nature, and, changes, its, form, until, it, attains, liberation, in, jainism, jiva, is, the, immortal, essence, or, soul, of, a, living, organism, such, as, human, animal, fish, or, plant, which, survives, physical, death, the, concept, of, ajiva, in, jainism, means, not, soul, and, represents, matter, including, body, time, space, non, motion, and, motion, in, jainism, a, jiva, is, either, samsari, mundane, caught, in, cycle, of, rebirths, or, mukta, liberated, according, to, this, belief, until, the, time, the, soul, is, liberated, from, the, sa, s, ra, cycle, of, repeated, birth, and, death, it, gets, attached, to, one, of, these, bodies, based, on, the, karma, actions, of, the, individual, soul, irrespective, of, which, state, the, soul, is, in, it, has, got, the, same, attributes, and, qualities, the, difference, between, the, liberated, and, non, liberated, souls, is, that, the, qualities, and, attributes, are, manifested, completely, in, case, of, siddha, liberated, soul, as, they, have, overcome, all, the, karmic, bondages, whereas, in, case, of, non, liberated, souls, they, are, partially, exhibited, souls, who, rise, victorious, over, wicked, emotions, while, still, remaining, within, physical, bodies, are, referred, to, as, arihants, concerning, the, jain, view, of, the, soul, virchand, gandhi, said, that, the, soul, lives, its, own, life, not, for, the, purpose, of, the, body, but, the, body, lives, for, the, purpose, of, the, soul, if, we, believe, that, the, soul, is, to, be, controlled, by, the, body, then, soul, misses, its, power, the, hebrew, terms, nefesh, literally, living, being, ruach, literally, wind, neshamah, literally, breath, chayah, literally, life, and, yechidah, literally, singularity, are, used, to, describe, the, soul, or, spirit, in, judaism, there, was, originally, little, to, no, concept, of, a, soul, as, seen, in, the, genesis, the, divine, breath, simply, animated, bodies, then, yahweh, god, formed, man, of, dust, from, the, ground, and, breathed, into, his, nostrils, the, breath, of, life, and, so, the, man, became, a, living, being, judaism, relates, the, quality, of, one, s, soul, to, one, s, performance, of, the, commandments, mitzvot, and, reaching, higher, levels, of, understanding, and, thus, closeness, to, god, a, person, with, such, closeness, is, called, a, tzadik, therefore, judaism, embraces, the, commemoration, of, the, day, of, one, s, death, nahala, yahrtzeit, and, not, the, birthday, as, a, festivity, of, remembrance, for, only, toward, the, end, of, life, s, struggles, tests, and, challenges, could, human, souls, be, judged, and, credited, for, righteousness, judaism, places, great, importance, on, the, study, of, the, souls, kabbalah, and, other, mystic, traditions, go, into, greater, detail, into, the, nature, of, the, soul, kabbalah, separates, the, soul, into, five, elements, corresponding, to, the, five, worlds, kabbalah, proposed, a, concept, of, reincarnation, the, gilgul, nefesh, habehamit, the, animal, soul, some, jewish, traditions, assert, that, the, soul, is, housed, in, the, luz, bone, though, traditions, disagree, as, to, whether, it, is, the, atlas, at, the, top, of, the, spine, or, the, sacrum, at, bottom, of, the, spine, the, scientology, view, is, that, a, person, does, not, have, a, soul, it, is, a, soul, it, is, the, belief, of, the, religion, that, they, do, not, have, the, power, to, force, adherents, conclusions, therefore, a, person, is, immortal, and, may, be, reincarnated, if, they, wish, scientologists, view, that, one, s, future, happiness, and, immortality, as, guided, by, their, spirituality, is, influenced, by, how, they, live, and, act, during, their, time, on, earth, scientology, s, term, for, the, soul, is, thetan, derived, from, the, greek, word, theta, symbolizing, thought, scientology, counselling, called, auditing, addresses, the, soul, to, improve, abilities, both, worldly, and, spiritual, the, ideologies, surrounding, this, understanding, align, with, those, of, the, five, major, world, religions, soul, dualism, also, called, multiple, souls, or, dualistic, pluralism, is, a, common, belief, in, shamanism, and, is, essential, in, the, universal, and, central, concept, of, soul, flight, also, called, soul, journey, out, of, body, experience, ecstasy, or, astral, projection, it, is, the, belief, that, humans, have, two, or, more, souls, generally, termed, the, body, soul, or, life, soul, and, the, free, soul, the, former, is, linked, to,

free, soul, is, said, to, leave, the, body, and, journey, to, the, spirit, world, during, sleep, trance, like, states, delirium, insanity, and, death, the, duality, is, also, seen, in, the, healing, traditions, of, austronesian, shamans, where, illnesses, are, regarded, as, a, soul, loss, and, thus, to, heal, the, sick, one, must, return, the, free, soul, which, may, have, been, stolen, by, an, evil, spirit, or, got, lost, in, the, spirit, world, into, the, body, if, the, free, soul, can, not, be, returned, the, afflicted, person, dies, or, goes, permanently, insane, the, shaman, heals, within, the, spiritual, dimension, by, returning, lost, parts, of, the, human, soul, from, wherever, they, have, gone, the, shaman, also, cleanses, excess, negative, energies, which, confuse, or, pollute, the, soul, in, some, ethnic, groups, there, can, also, be, more, than, two, souls, like, among, the, tagbanwa, people, where, a, person, is, said, to, have, six, souls, the, free, soul,

associated, with, respiration, the, other, can, accompany, the, body, as, a, shadow, in, some, cases, it, is, connected, to, shamanistic, beliefs, among, the, various, inuit, groups, caribou, inuit, groups, also, believed, in, several, types, of, souls, shinto, distinguishes, between, the, souls, of, living, persons, tamashii, and, those, of, dead, persons, mitama, each, of, which, may, have, different, aspects, or, sub, souls, sikhism, considers, soul, atma, to, be, part, of, god, waheguru, various, hymns, are, cited, from, the, holy, book, guru, granth, sahib, sggs, that, suggests, this, belief, god, is, in, the, soul, and, the, soul, is, in, the, god, the, same, concept, is, repeated, at, various, pages, of, the, sggs, example, include, that, the, soul, is, divine, divine, is, the, soul, worship, him, with, love, and, the, soul, is, the, lord, and, the, lord, is, the, soul, contemplating, the, shabad, the, lord, is, found, the, atma, or, soul, according, to, sikhism, is, an, entity, or, spiritual, spark, or, light, in, the, human, body, because, of, which, the, body, can, sustain, life, on, the, departure, of, this, entity, from, the, body, the, body, becomes, lifeless, no, amount, of, manipulations, to, the, body, can, make, the, person, make, any, physical, actions, the, soul, is, the, driver, in, the, body, it, is, the, roohu, or, spirit, or, atma, the, presence, of, which, makes, the, physical, body, alive, many, religious, and, philosophical, traditions, support, the, view, that, the, soul, is, the, ethereal, substance, a, spirit, a, non, material, spark, particular, to, a, unique, living, being, such, traditions, often, consider, the, soul, both, immortal, and, innately, aware, of, its, immortal, nature, as, well, as, the, true, basis, for, sentience, in, each, living, being, the, concept, of, the, soul, has, strong, links, with, notions, of, an, afterlife, but, opinions, may, vary, wildly, even, within, a, given, religion, as, to, what, happens, to, the, soul, after, death, many, within, these, religions, and, philosophies, see, the, soul, as, immaterial, while, others, consider, it, possibly, material, according, to, chinese, traditions, every, person, has, two, types, of, soul, called, hun, and, po, and, which, are, respectively, yang, and, yin, taoism, believes, in, ten, souls, sanhunqipo, three, hun, and, seven, po, a, living, being, that, loses, any, of, them, is, said, to, have, mental, illness, or, unconsciousness, while, a, dead, soul, may, reincarnate, to, a, disability, lower, desire, realms, or, may, even, be, unable, to, reincarnate, in, theological, reference, to, the, soul, the, terms, life, and, death, are, viewed, as, emphatically, more, definitive, than, the, common, concepts, of, biological, life, and, biological, death, because, the, soul, is, said, to, be, transcendent, of, the, material, existence, and, is, said, to, have, potentially, eternal, life, the, death, of, the, soul, is, likewise, said, to, be, an, eternal, death, thus, in, the, concept, of, divine, judgment, god, is, commonly, said, to, have, options, with, regard, to, the, dispensation, of, souls, ranging, from, heaven, i, e, angels, to, hell, i, e, demons, with, various, concepts, in, between, typically, both, heaven, and, hell, are, said, to, be, eternal, or, at, least, far, beyond, a, typical, human, concept, of, lifespan, and, time, according, to, louis, ginzberg, the, soul, of, adam, is, the, image, of, god, every, soul, of, human, also, escapes, from, the, body, every, night, rises, up, to, heaven, and, fetches, new, life, thence, for, the, body, of, man, in, brahma, kumaris, human, souls, are, believed, to, be, incorporeal, and, eternal, god, is, considered, to, be, the, supreme, soul, with, maximum, degrees, of, spiritual, qualities, such, as, peace, love, and, purity, in, helena, blavatsky, s, theosophy, the, soul, is, the, field, of, our, psychological, activity, thinking, emotions, memory, desires, will, and, so, on, as, well, as, of, the, paranormal, or, psychic, phenomena, such, as, extrasensory, perception, or, out, of, body, experiences, however, the, soul, is, not, the, highest, but, a, middle, dimension, of, human, beings, higher, than, the, soul, is, the, spirit, which, is, considered, to, be, the, real, self, the, source, of, everything, is, called, good, happiness, wisdom, love, compassion, harmony, peace, and, so, on, while, the, spirit, is, eternal, and, incorruptible, the, soul, is, not, the, soul, acts, as, a, link, between, the, material, body, and, the, spiritual, self, and, therefore, shares, some, characteristics, of, both, the, soul, can, be, attracted, either, towards, the, spiritual, or, towards, the, material, realm, being, thus, the, battlefield, of, good, and, evil, it, is, only, when, the, soul, is, attracted, towards, the, spiritual, and, merges, with, the, self, that, it, becomes, eternal, and, divine, rudolf, steiner, claimed, classical, trichotomic, stages, of, soul, development, which, interpenetrated, one, another, in, consciousness, in, surat, shabda, yoga, the, soul, is, considered, to, be, an, exact, replica, and, spark, of, the, divine, the, purpose, of, surat, shabd, yoga, is, to, realize, one, s, true, self, as, soul, self, realisation, true, essence, spirit, realisation, and, true, divinity, god, realisation, while, living, in, the, physical, body, similarly, the, spiritual, teacher, meher, baba, held, that, atma, or, the, soul, is, in, reality, identical, with, paramatma, the, oversoul, which, is, one, infinite, and, eternal, he, sole, purpose, of, creation, is, for, the, soul, to, enjoy, the, infinite, state, of, the, oversoul, consciously, eckankar, founded, by, paul, twitchell, in, 1965, defines, soul, as, the, true, self, the, inner, most, sacred, part, of, each, person, george, gurdjieff, taught, that, humans, are, not, born, with, immortal, souls, but, could, develop, them, through, certain, efforts, greek, philosophers, such, as, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, understood, that, the, soul, psykh, must, have, a, logical, faculty, the, exercise, of, which, was, the, most, divine, of, human, actions, at, his, defense, trial, socrates, even, summarized, his, teachings, as, nothing, other, than, an, exhortation, for, his, fellow, athenians, to, excel, in, matters, of, the, psyche, since, all, bodily, goods, are, dependent, on, such, excellence, apology, 30a, b, aristotle, reasoned, that, a, man, s, body, and, soul, were, his, matter, and, form, respectively, the, body, is, a, collection, of, elements, and, the, soul, is, the, essence, soul, or, psyche, ancient, greek, psykh, of, ps, khein, to, breathe, cf, latin, anima, comprises, the, mental, abilities, of, a, living, being, reason, character, free, will, feeling, consciousness, qualia, memory, perception, thinking, and, so, on, depending, on, the, philosophical, system, a, soul, can, either, be, mortal, or, immortal, the, ancient, greeks, used, the, term, ensouled, to, represent, the, concept, of, being, alive, indicating, that, the, earliest, surviving, western, philosophical, view, believed, that, the, soul, was, that, which, gave, the, body, life, the, soul, was, considered, the, incorporeal, or, spiritual, breath, that, animates, from, the, latin, anima, cf, animal, the, living, organism, francis, m, cornford, quotes, pindar, by, saying, that, the, soul, sleeps, while, the, limbs, are, active, but, when, one, is, sleeping, the, soul, is, active, and, reveals, an, award, of, joy, or, sorrow, drawing, near, in, dreams, erwin, rohde, writes, that, an, early, pre, pythagorean, belief, presented, the, soul, as, lifeless, when, it, departed, the, body, and, that, it, retired, into, hades, with, no, hope, of, returning, to, a, body, plato, was, the, first, thinker, in, antiquity, to, combine, the, various, functions, of, the, soul, into, one, coherent, conception, the, soul, is, that, which, moves, things, i, e, that, which, gives, life, on, the, view, that, life, is, self, motion, by, means, of, its, thoughts, requiring, that, it, be, both, a, mover, and, a, thinker, drawing, on, the, words, of, his, teacher, socrates, plato, considered, the, psyche, to, be, the, essence, of, a, person, being, that, which, decides, how, humans, behave, he, considered, this, essence, to, be, an, incorporeal, eternal, occupant, of, our, being, plato, said, that, even, after, death, the, soul, exists, and, is, able, to, think, he, believed, that, as, bodies, die, the, soul, is, continually, reborn, metempsychosis, in, subsequent, bodies, however, aristotle, believed, that, only, one, part, of, the, soul, was, immortal, namely, the, intellect, logos, the, platonic, soul, consists, of, three, parts, the, parts, are, located, in, different, regions, of, the, body, plato, compares, the, three, parts, of, the, soul, or, psyche, to, a, societal, caste, system, according, to, plato, s, theory, the, three, part, soul, is, essentially, the, same, thing, as, a, state, s, class, system, because, to, function, well, each, part, must, contribute, so, that, the, whole, functions, well, logos, keeps, the, other, functions, of, the, soul, regulated, the, soul, is, at, the, heart, of, plato, s, philosophy, francis, cornford, described, the, twin, pillars, of, platonism, as, being, the, theory, of, forms, on, the, one, hand, the, doctrine, of, the, immortality, of, the, soul, on, the, other, plato, was, the, first, person, in, the, history, of, philosophy, to, believe, that, the, soul, was, both, the, source, of, life, and, the, mind, in, plato, s, dialogues, the, soul, plays, many, disparate, roles, among, other, things, plato, believes, that, the, soul, is, what, gives, life, to, the, body, which, was, articulated, most, of, all, in, the, laws, and, phaedrus, in, terms, of, self, motion, to, be, alive, is, to, be, capable, of, moving, yourself, and, the, soul, is, a, self, mover, he, also, thinks, that, the, soul, is, the, bearer, of, moral, properties, i, e, when, one, is, virtuous, it, is, their, soul, that, is, virtuous, as, opposed, to, say, their, body, the, soul, is, also, the, mind, it, is, that, which, thinks, in, them, this, casual, oscillation, between, different, roles, of, the, soul, in, observed, many, dialogues, including, in, the, republic, is, there, any, function, of, the, soul, that, you, could, not, accomplish, with, anything, else, such, as, taking, care, of, something, epimeleisthai, ruling, and, deliberating, and, other, such, things, could, we, correctly, assign, these, things, to, anything, besides, the, soul, and, say, that, they, are, characteristic, idia, of, it, no, to, nothing, else, what, about, living, will, we, deny, that, this, is, a, function, of, the, soul, that, absolutely, is, the, phaedo, most, famously, caused, problems, to, scholars, who, were, trying, to, make, sense, of, this, aspect, of, plato, s, theory, of, the, soul, such, as, dorothea, frede, and, sarah, broadie, 2020s, scholarship, overturned, this, accusation, by, arguing, that, part, of, the, novelty, of, plato, s, theory, of, the, soul, is, that, it, was, the, first, to, unite, the, different, features, and, powers, of, the, soul, that, became, commonplace, in, later, ancient, and, medieval, philosophy, for, plato, the, soul, moves, things, by, means, of, its, thoughts, as, one, scholar, puts, it, and, accordingly, the, soul, is, both, a, mover, i, e, the, principle, of, life, where, life, is, conceived, of, as, self, motion, and, a, thinker, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, defined, the, soul, or, ps, ch, as, the, first, actuality, of, a, naturally, organized, body, and, argued, against, its, separate, existence, from, the, physical, body, in, aristotle, s, view, the, primary, activity, or, full, actualization, of, a, living, thing, constitutes, its, soul, for, example, the, full, actualization, of, an, eye, as, an, independent, organism, is, to, see, its, purpose, or, final, cause, another, example, is, that, the, full, actualization, of, a, human, being, would, be, living, a, fully, functional, human, life, in, accordance, with, reason, which, he, considered, to, be, a, faculty, unique, to, humanity, for, aristotle, the, soul, is, the, organization, of, the, form, and, matter, of, a, natural, being, which, allows, it, to, strive, for, its, full, actualization, this, organization, between, form, and, matter, is, necessary, for, any, activity, or, functionality, to, be, possible, in, a, natural, being, using, an, artifact, non, natural, being, as, an, example, a, house, is, a, building, for, human, habituation, but, for, a, house, to, be, actualized, requires, the, material, such, as, wood, nails, or, bricks, necessary, for, its, actuality, i, e, being, a, fully, functional, house, however, this, does, not, imply, that, a, house, has, a, soul, in, regards, to, artifacts, the, source, of, motion, that, is, required, for, their, full, actualization, is, outside, of, themselves, for, example, a, builder, builds, a, house, in, natural, beings, this, source, of, motion, is, contained, within, the, being, itself, aristotle, addressed, the, faculties, of, the, soul, the, various, faculties, of, the, soul, such, as, nutrition, movement, peculiar, to, animals, reason, peculiar, to, humans, sensation, special, common, and, incidental, and, so, forth, when, exercised, constitute, the, second, actuality, or, fulfillment, of, the, capacity, to, be, alive, for, example, someone, who, falls, asleep, as, opposed, to, someone, who, falls, dead, can, wake, up, and, live, their, life, while, the, latter, can, no, longer, do, so, aristotle, identified, three, hierarchical, levels, of, natural, beings, plants, animals, and, people, having, three, different, degrees, of, soul, bios, life, zo, animate, life, and, psuch, self, conscious, life, for, these, groups, he, identified, three, corresponding, levels, of, soul, or, biological, activity, the, nutritive, activity, of, growth, sustenance, and, reproduction, which, all, life, shares, bios, the, self, willed, motive, activity, and, sensory, faculties, which, only, animals, and, people, have, in, common, zo, and, finally, reason, of, which, humans, alone, are, capable, pseuch, aristotle, s, discussion, of, the, soul, is, in, his, work, de, anima, on, the, soul, although, mostly, seen, as, opposing, plato, in, regard, to, the, immortality, of, the, soul, a, controversy, can, be, found, in, relation, to, the, fifth, chapter, of, the, third, book, in, this, text, both, interpretations, can, be, argued, for, soul, as, a, whole, can, be, deemed, mortal, and, a, part, called, active, intellect, or, active, mind, is, immortal, and, eternal, advocates, exist, for, both, sides, of, the, controversy, it, is, argued, that, there, will, be, permanent, disagreement, about, its, final, conclusions, as, no, other, aristotelian, text, contains, this, specific, point, and, this, part, of, de, anima, is, obscure, furthermore, aristotle, states, that, the, soul, helps, humans, find, the, truth, and, understanding, the, true, purpose, or, role, of, the, soul, is, extremely, difficult, following, aristotle, avicenna, ibn, sina, and, ibn, al, nafis, an, arab, physician, further, elaborated, upon, the, aristotelian, understanding, of, the, soul, and, developed, their, own, theories, on, the, soul, they, both, made, a, distinction, between, the, soul, and, the, spirit, and, the, avicennian, doctrine, on, the, nature, of, the, soul, was, influential, among, the, scholastics, some, of, avicenna, s, views, on, the, soul, include, the, idea, that, the, immortality, of, the, soul, is, a, consequence, of, its, nature, and, not, a, purpose, for, it, to, fulfill, in, his, theory, of, the, ten, intellects, he, viewed, the, human, soul, as, the, tenth, and, final, intellect, while, he, was, imprisoned, avicenna, wrote, his, famous, floating, man, thought, experiment, to, demonstrate, human, self, awareness, and, the, substantial, nature, of, the, soul, he, told, his, readers, to, imagine, themselves, suspended, in, the, air, isolated, from, all, sensations, which, includes, no, sensory, contact, with, even, their, own, bodies, he, argues, that, in, this, scenario, one, would, still, have, self, consciousness, he, thus, concludes, that, the, idea, of, the, self, is, not, logically, dependent, on, any, physical, thing, and, that, the, soul, should, not, be, seen, in, relative, terms, but, as, a, primary, given, a, substance, this, argument, was, later, refined, and, simplified, by, ren, descartes, in, epistemic, terms, when, he, stated, i, can, abstract, from, the, supposition, of, all, external, things, but, not, from, the, supposition, of, my, own, consciousness, avicenna, generally, supported, aristotle, s, idea, of, the, soul, originating, from, the, heart, whereas, ibn, al, nafis, rejected, this, idea, and, instead, argued, that, the, soul, is, related, to, the, entirety, and, not, to, one, or, a, few, organs, he, further, criticized, aristotle, s, idea, whereby, every, unique, soul, requires, the, existence, of, a, unique, source, in, this, case, the, heart, al, nafis, concluded, that, the, soul, is, related, primarily, neither, to, the, spirit, nor, to, any, organ, but, rather, to, the, entire, matter, whose, temperament, is, prepared, to, receive, that, soul, and, he, defined, the, soul, as, nothing, other, than, what, a, human, indicates, by, saying, i, following, aristotle, whom, he, referred, to, as, the, philosopher, and, avicenna, thomas, aquinas, 1225, 1274, understood, the, soul, to, be, the, first, actuality, of, the, living, body, consequent, to, this, he, distinguished, three, orders, of, life, plants, which, feed, and, grow, animals, which, add, sensation, to, the, operations, of, plants, and, humans, which, add, intellect, to, the, operations, of, animals, concerning, the, human, soul, his, epistemological, theory, required, that, since, the, knower, becomes, what, he, knows, the, soul, is, definitely, not, corporeal, if, it, is, corporeal, when, it, knows, what, some, corporeal, thing, is, that, thing, would, come, to, be, within, it, therefore, the, soul, has, an, operation, which, does, not, rely, on, a, body, organ, and, therefore, the, soul, can, exist, without, a, body, furthermore, since, the, rational, soul, of, human, beings, is, a, subsistent, form, and, not, something, made, of, matter, and, form, it, cannot, be, destroyed, in, any, natural, process, the, full, argument, for, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, aquinas, elaboration, of, aristotelian, theory, is, found, in, question, 75, of, the, first, part, of, the, summa, theologica, aquinas, affirmed, in, the, doctrine, of, the, divine, effusion, of, the, soul, the, particular, judgement, of, the, soul, after, the, separation, from, a, dead, body, and, the, final, resurrection, of, the, flesh, he, recalled, two, canons, of, the, 4th, century, de, ecclesiasticis, dogmatibus, for, which, the, rational, soul, is, not, engendered, by, coition, canon, xiv, and, is, one, and, the, same, soul, in, man, that, both, gives, life, to, the, body, by, being, united, to, it, and, orders, itself, by, its, own, reasoning, moreover, he, believed, in, a, unique, and, tripartite, soul, within, which, are, distinctively, present, a, nutritive, a, sensitive, and, intellectual, soul, the, latter, is, created, by, god, and, is, taken, solely, by, human, beings, includes, the, other, two, types, of, soul, and, makes, the, sensitive, soul, incorruptible, in, his, discussions, of, rational, psychology, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, identified, the, soul, as, the, i, in, the, strictest, sense, and, argued, that, the, existence, of, inner, experience, can, neither, be, proved, nor, disproved, he, said, we, cannot, prove, a, priori, the, immateriality, of, the, soul, but, rather, only, so, much, that, all, properties, and, actions, of, the, soul, cannot, be, recognized, from, materiality, it, is, from, the, i, or, soul, that, kant, proposes, transcendental, rationalization, but, cautions, that, such, rationalization, can, only, determine, the, limits, of, knowledge, if, it, is, to, remain, practical, gilbert, ryle, s, ghost, in, the, machine, argument, which, is, a, rejection, of, descartes, s, mind, body, dualism, can, provide, a, contemporary, understanding, of, the, soul, mind, and, the, problem, concerning, its, connection, to, the, brain, body, soul, belief, prominently, figures, in, otto, rank, s, work, recovering, the, importance, of, immortality, in, the, psychology, of, primitive, classical, and, modern, interest, in, life, and, death, rank, s, work, directly, opposed, the, scientific, psychology, that, concedes, the, possibility, of, the, soul, s, existence, and, postulates, it, as, an, object, of, research, without, really, admitting, that, it, exists, he, says, just, as, religion, represents, a, psychological, commentary, on, the, social, evolution, of, man, various, psychologies, represent, our, current, attitudes, toward, spiritual, belief, in, the, animistic, era, psychologizing, was, a, creating, of, the, soul, in, the, religious, era, it, was, a, representing, of, the, soul, to, one, s, self, in, our, era, of, natural, science, it, is, a, knowing, of, the, individual, soul, rank, s, seelenglaube, translates, to, soul, belief, rank, s, work, had, a, significant, influence, on, ernest, becker, s, understanding, of, a, universal, interest, in, immortality, in, the, denial, of, death, becker, describes, soul, in, terms, of, s, ren, kierkegaard, use, of, self, when, he, says, that, what, we, call, schizophrenia, is, an, attempt, by, the, symbolic, self, to, deny, the, limitations, of, the, finite, body, kierkegaard, s, use, of, self, may, be, a, bit, confusing, he, uses, it, to, include, the, symbolic, self, and, the, physical, body, it, is, a, synonym, really, for, total, personality, that, goes, beyond, the, person, to, include, what, we, would, now, call, the, soul, or, the, ground, of, being, out, of, which, the, created, person, sprang, according, to, julien, musolino, the, scientific, consensus, holds, that, the, mind, is, a, complex, machine, that, operates, on, the, same, physical, laws, as, all, other, objects, in, the, universe, according, to, musolino, there, is, currently, no, scientific, evidence, whatsoever, to, support, the, existence, of, soul, the, search, for, the, soul, is, seen, to, have, been, instrumental, in, driving, the, understanding, of, the, anatomy, and, physiology, of, the, human, body, particularly, in, the, fields, of, cardiovascular, and, neurology, in, the, two, dominant, conflicting, concepts, of, the, soul, one, seeing, it, to, be, spiritual, and, immortal, and, the, other, seeing, it, to, be, material, and, mortal, both, have, described, the, soul, as, being, located, in, a, particular, organ, or, as, pervading, the, whole, body, as, an, interdisciplinary, field, and, its, branch, of, cognitive, neuroscience, particularly, neuroscience, operates, under, the, ontological, assumption, of, physicalism, in, other, words, it, assumes, that, only, the, fundamental, phenomena, studied, by, physics, exist, thus, neuroscience, seeks, to, understand, mental, phenomena, within, the, framework, according, to, which, human, thought, and, behavior, are, caused, solely, by, physical, processes, taking, place, inside, the, brain, and, it, operates, by, the, way, of, reductionism, by, seeking, an, explanation, for, the, mind, in, terms, of, brain, activity, to, study, the, mind, in, terms, of, the, brain, several, methods, of, functional, neuroimaging, are, used, to, study, the, neuroanatomical, correlates, of, various, cognitive, processes, that, constitute, the, mind, the, evidence, from, brain, imaging, indicates, that, all, processes, of, the, mind, have, physical, correlates, in, brain, function, however, such, correlational, studies, cannot, determine, whether, neural, activity, plays, a, causal, role, in, the, occurrence, of, these, cognitive, processes, correlation, does, not, imply, causation, and, they, cannot, determine, if, the, neural, activity, is, either, necessary, or, sufficient, for, such, processes, to, occur, identification, of, causation, and, of, necessary, and, sufficient, conditions, requires, explicit, experimental, manipulation, of, that, activity, if, manipulation, of, brain, activity, changes, consciousness, then, a, causal, role, for, that, brain, activity, can, be, inferred, two, of, the, most, common, types, of, manipulation, experiments, are, loss, of, function, and, gain, of, function, experiments, in, a, loss, of, function, also, called, necessity, experiment, a, part, of, the, nervous, system, is, diminished, or, removed, in, an, attempt, to, determine, if, it, is, necessary, for, a, certain, process, to, occur, and, in, a, gain, of, function, also, called, sufficiency, experiment, an, aspect, of, the, nervous, system, is, increased, relative, to, normal, manipulations, of, brain, activity, can, be, performed, with, direct, electrical, brain, stimulation, magnetic, brain, stimulation, using, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, psychopharmacological, manipulation, optogenetic, manipulation, and, by, studying, the, symptoms, of, brain, damage, case, studies, and, lesions, in, addition, neuroscientists, are, also, investigating, how, the, mind, develops, with, the, development, of, the, brain, neuroscience, research, hypothesizes, that, a, near, death, experience, an, nde, is, a, subjective, phenomenon, resulting, from, disturbed, bodily, multisensory, integration, that, occurs, during, life, threatening, events, some, researchers, of, near, death, experiences, consider, such, a, phenomenon, as, a, challenge, to, the, materialist, assumptions, about, the, relationship, between, mind, and, brain, sam, parnia, and, others, have, suggested, that, a, mind, that, is, mediated, by, but, not, produced, by, the, brain, is, a, possible, way, to, explain, nde, physicist, sean, m, carroll, has, written, that, the, idea, of, a, soul, is, incompatible, with, quantum, field, theory, qft, he, writes, that, for, a, soul, to, exist, ot, only, is, new, physics, required, but, dramatically, new, physics, within, qft, there, can, t, be, a, new, collection, of, spirit, particles, and, spirit, forces, that, interact, with, our, regular, atoms, because, we, would, have, detected, them, in, existing, experiments, quantum, indeterminism, has, been, invoked, as, an, explanatory, mechanism, for, possible, soul, brain, interaction, neuroscientist, peter, clarke, found, errors, with, this, viewpoint, observing, there, is, no, evidence, that, such, processes, play, a, role, in, brain, function, clarke, concluded, that, a, cartesian, soul, has, no, basis, from, quantum, physics, some, parapsychologists, attempted, to, establish, by, scientific, experiment, whether, a, soul, separate, from, the, brain, exists, as, is, more, commonly, defined, in, religion, rather, than, as, a, synonym, of, psyche, or, mind, milbourne, christopher, 1979, and, mary, roach, 2010, have, argued, that, none, of, the, attempts, by, parapsychologists, have, yet, succeeded, in, 1901, duncan, macdougall, conducted, an, experiment, 21, grams, experiment, in, which, he, made, weight, measurements, of, patients, as, they, died, he, claimed, that, there, was, weight, loss, of, varying, amounts, at, the, time, of, death, he, concluded, the, soul, weighed, 21, grams, based, on, measurements, of, a, single, patient, discarding, conflicting, results, the, physicist, robert, l, park, wrote, that, macdougall, s, experiments, are, not, regarded, today, as, having, any, scientific, merit, and, the, psychologist, bruce, hood, wrote, that, because, the, weight, loss, was, not, reliable, or, replicable, his, findings, were, unscientific
