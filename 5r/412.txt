from, the, pages, of, middle, french, medieval, romances, according, to, some, historians, such, as, barth, lemy, d, herbelot, fairies, were, adopted, from, and, influenced, by, the, peris, of,

this, may, have, influenced, migratory, germanic, and, eurasian, settlers, into, europe, or, been, transmitted, during, early, exchanges, the, similarities, could, also, be, attributed, to, a, shared, proto, indo, european, mythology, in, the, middle, ages, fairie, was, used, adjectivally, meaning, enchanted, as, in, fairie, knight, fairie, queene, but, also, became, a, generic, term, for, various, enchanted, creatures, during, the, late, middle, english, period, literature, of, the, elizabethan, era, conflated, elves, with, the, fairies, of, romance, culture, rendering, these, terms, somewhat, interchangeable, the, modern, concept, of, fairy, in, the, narrower, sense, is, unique, to, english, folklore, later, made, diminutive, in, accordance, with, prevailing, tastes, of, the, victorian, era, as, in, fairy, tales, for, children, the, victorian, era, and, edwardian, era, saw, a, heightened, increase, of, interest, in, fairies, the, celtic, revival, cast, fairies, as, part, of, ireland,

fairies, are, generally, described, as, human, in, appearance, and, having, magical, powers, diminutive, fairies, of, various, kinds, have, been, reported, through, centuries, ranging, from, quite, tiny, to, the, size, of, a, human, these, small, sizes, could, be, magically, assumed, rather, than, constant, some, smaller, fairies, could, expand, their, figures, to, imitate, humans, on, orkney, fairies, were, described, as, short, in, stature, dressed, in, dark, grey, and, sometimes, seen, in, armour, in, some, folklore, fairies, have, green, eyes, some, depictions, of, fairies, show, them,

or, the, backs, of, birds, modern, illustrations, often, include, dragonfly, or, butterfly, wings, early, modern, fairies, does, not, derive, from, a, single, origin, the, term, is, a, conflation, of, disparate, elements, from, folk, belief, sources, influenced, by, literature, and, speculation, in, folklore, of, ireland, the, mythic, aes, s, dhe, or, people, of, the, fairy, hills, have, come, to, a, modern, meaning, somewhat, inclusive, of, fairies, the, scandinavian, elves, also, served, as, an, influence, folklorists, and, mythologists, have, variously, depicted, fairies, as, the, unworthy, dead, the, children, of, eve, a, kind, of, demon, a, species, independent, of, humans, an, older, race, of, humans, and, fallen, angels, the, folkloristic, or, mythological, elements, combine, celtic, germanic, and, greco, roman, elements, folklorists, have, suggested, that, fairies, arose, from, various, earlier, beliefs, which, lost, currency, with, the, advent, of, christianity, these, disparate, explanations, are, not, necessarily, incompatible, as, fairies, may, be, traced, to, multiple, sources, a, christian, tenet, held, that, fairies, were, a, class, of, demoted, angels, one, story, described, a, group, of, angels, revolting, and, god, ordering, the, gates, of, heaven, shut, those, still, in, heaven, remained, angels, those, in, hell, became, demons, and, those, caught, in, between, became, fairies, others, wrote, that, some, angels, not, being, godly, enough, yet, not, evil, enough, for, hell, were, thrown, out, of, heaven, this, concept, may, explain, the, tradition, of, paying, a, teind, or, tithe, to, hell, as, fallen, angels, although, not, quite, devils, they, could, be, viewed, as, subjects, of, satan, king, james, i, in, his, dissertation, daemonologie, stated, the, term, faries, referred, to, illusory, spirits, demonic, entities, that, prophesied, to, consorted, with, and, transported, the, individuals, they, served, in, medieval, times, a, witch, or, sorcerer, who, had, a, pact, with, a, familiar, spirit, might, receive, these, services, in, england, s, theosophist, circles, of, the, 19th, century, a, belief, in, the, angelic, nature, of, fairies, was, reported, entities, referred, to, as, devas, were, said, to, guide, many, processes, of, nature, such, as, evolution, of, organisms, growth, of, plants, etc, many, of, which, resided, inside, the, sun, solar, angels, the, more, earthbound, devas, included, nature, spirits, elementals, and, fairies, which, were, described, as, appearing, in, the, form, of, colored, flames, roughly, the, size, of, a, human, arthur, conan, doyle, in, his, 1922, book, the, coming, of, the, fairies, the, theosophic, view, of, fairies, reported, that, eminent, theosophist, e, l, gardner, had, likened, fairies, to, butterflies, whose, function, was, to, provide, an, essential, link, between, the, energy, of, the, sun, and, the, plants, of, earth, describing, them, as, having, no, clean, cut, shape, small, hazy, and, somewhat, luminous, clouds, of, colour, with, a, brighter, sparkish, nucleus, that, growth, of, a, plant, which, we, regard, as, the, customary, and, inevitable, result, of, associating, the, three, factors, of, sun, seed, and, soil, would, never, take, place, if, the, fairy, builders, were, absent, for, a, similar, concept, in, persian, mythology, see, peri, at, one, time, it, was, thought, that, fairies, were, originally, worshiped, as, deities, such, as, nymphs, and, tree, spirits, and, with, the, burgeoning, predominance, of, the, christian, church, reverence, for, these, deities, carried, on, but, in, a, dwindling, state, of, perceived, power, many, deprecated, deities, of, older, folklore, and, myth, were, repurposed, as, fairies, in, victorian, fiction, see, the, works, of, w, b, yeats, for, examples, a, recorded, christian, belief, of, the, 17th, century, cast, all, fairies, as, demons, this, perspective, grew, more, popular, with, the, rise, of, puritanism, among, the, reformed, church, of, england, see, anglicanism, the, hobgoblin, once, a, friendly, household, spirit, became, classed, as, a, wicked, goblin, dealing, with, fairies, was, considered, a, form, of, witchcraft, and, punished, as, such, in, william, shakespeare, s, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, oberon, king, of, the, faeries, states, that, neither, he, nor, his, court, fear, the, church, bells, which, the, author, and, christian, apologist, c, s, lewis, cast, as, a, politic, disassociation, from, faeries, although, lewis, makes, it, clear, that, he, himself, does, not, consider, fairies, to, be, demons, in, his, chapter, on, the, topic, the, longaevi, or, long, livers, from, the, discarded, image, in, an, era, of, intellectual, and, religious, upheaval, some, victorian, reappraisals, of, mythology, cast, deities, in, general, as, metaphors, for, natural, events, which, was, later, refuted, by, other, authors, see, the, triumph, of, the, moon, by, ronald, hutton, this, contentious, environment, of, thought, contributed, to, the, modern, meaning, of, fairies, one, belief, held, that, fairies, were, spirits, of, the, dead, this, derived, from, many, factors, common, in, various, folklore, and, myths, same, or, similar, tales, of, both, ghosts, and, fairies, the, irish, s, dhe, origin, of, their, term, for, fairies, were, ancient, burial, mounds, deemed, dangerous, to, eat, food, in, fairyland, and, hades, the, dead, and, fairies, depicted, as, living, underground, diane, purkiss, observed, an, equating, of, fairies, with, the, untimely, dead, who, left, unfinished, lives, one, tale, recounted, a, man, caught, by, the, fairies, who, found, that, whenever, he, looked, steadily, at, a, fairy, it, appeared, as, a, dead, neighbor, of, his, this, theory, was, among, the, more, common, traditions, related, although, many, informants, also, expressed, doubts, there, is, an, outdated, theory, that, fairy, folklore, evolved, from, folk, memories, of, a, prehistoric, race, newcomers, superseded, a, body, of, earlier, human, or, humanoid, peoples, and, the, memories, of, this, defeated, race, developed, into, modern, conceptions, of, fairies, proponents, find, support, in, the, tradition, of, cold, iron, as, a, charm, against, fairies, viewed, as, a, cultural, memory, of, invaders, with, iron, weapons, displacing, peoples, who, had, just, stone, bone, wood, etc, at, their, disposal, and, were, easily, defeated, 19th, century, archaeologists, uncovered, underground, rooms, in, the, orkney, islands, that, resembled, the, elfland, described, in, childe, rowland, which, lent, additional, support, in, folklore, flint, arrowheads, from, the, stone, age, were, attributed, to, the, fairies, as, elfshot, while, their, green, clothing, and, underground, homes, spoke, to, a, need, for, camouflage, and, covert, shelter, from, hostile, humans, their, magic, a, necessary, skill, for, combating, those, with, superior, weaponry, in, a, victorian, tenet, of, evolution, mythic, cannibalism, among, ogres, was, attributed, to, memories, of, more, savage, races, practising, alongside, superior, races, of, more, refined, sensibilities, the, most, important, modern, proponent, of, the, hidden, people, theory, was, the, scottish, folklorist, and, antiquarian, david, macritchie, a, theory, that, fairies, et, al, were, intelligent, species, distinct, from, humans, and, angels, an, alchemist, paracelsus, classed, gnomes, and, sylphs, as, elementals, meaning, magical, entities, who, personify, a, particular, force, of, nature, and, exert, powers, over, these, forces, folklore, accounts, have, described, fairies, as, spirits, of, the, air, much, folklore, of, fairies, involves, methods, of, protecting, oneself, from, their, malice, by, means, such, as, cold, iron, charms, see, amulet, talisman, of, rowan, trees, or, various, herbs, or, simply, shunning, locations, known, to, be, theirs, ergo, avoiding, offending, any, fairies, less, harmful, pranks, ascribed, to, fairies, include, tangling, the, hair, of, sleepers, into, fairy, locks, aka, elf, locks, stealing, small, items, and, leading, a, traveler, astray, more, dangerous, behaviors, were, also, attributed, to, fairies, any, form, of, sudden, death, might, have, stemmed, from, a, fairy, kidnapping, the, evident, corpse, a, magical, replica, of, wood, consumption, tuberculosis, was, sometimes, blamed, on, fairies, who, forced, young, men, and, women, to, dance, at, revels, every, night, causing, them, to, waste, away, from, lack, of, rest, rowan, trees, were, considered, sacred, to, fairies, and, a, charm, tree, to, protect, one, s, home, various, folklorists, have, proposed, classification, systems, for, fairies, using, terms, popularized, by, w, b, yeats, trooping, fairies, are, those, who, appear, in, groups, and, might, form, settlements, as, opposed, to, solitary, fairies, who, do, not, live, or, associate, with, others, of, their, kind, in, this, context, the, term, fairy, is, usually, held, in, a, wider, sense, including, various, similar, beings, such, as, dwarves, and, elves, of, germanic, folklore, in, scottish, folklore, fairies, are, divided, into, the, seelie, court, more, beneficently, inclined, but, still, dangerous, and, the, unseelie, court, more, malicious, while, fairies, of, the, seelie, court, enjoyed, playing, generally, harmless, pranks, on, humans, those, of, the, unseelie, court, often, brought, harm, to, humans, for, entertainment, both, could, be, dangerous, to, humans, if, offended, some, scholars, have, cautioned, against, the, overuse, of, dividing, fairies, into, types, british, folklore, historian, simon, young, noted, that, classification, varies, widely, from, researcher, to, researcher, and, pointed, out, that, it, does, not, necessarily, reflect, old, beliefs, since, those, people, living, hundreds, of, years, ago, did, not, structure, their, experience, as, we, do, a, considerable, amount, of, lore, about, fairies, revolves, around, changelings, fairies, left, in, the, place, of, stolen, humans, in, particular, folklore, describes, how, to, prevent, the, fairies, from, stealing, babies, and, substituting, changelings, and, abducting, older, people, as, well, the, theme, of, the, swapped, child, is, common, in, medieval, literature, and, reflects, concern, over, infants, thought, to, be, afflicted, with, unexplained, diseases, disorders, or, developmental, disabilities, in, pre, industrial, europe, a, peasant, family, s, subsistence, frequently, depended, upon, the, productive, labor, of, each, member, and, a, person, who, was, a, permanent, drain, on, the, family, s, scarce, resources, could, pose, a, threat, to, the, survival, of, the, entire, family, in, terms, of, protective, charms, wearing, clothing, inside, out, church, bells, st, john, s, wort, and, four, leaf, clovers, are, regarded, as, effective, in, newfoundland, folklore, the, most, popular, type, of, fairy, protection, is, bread, varying, from, stale, bread, to, hard, tack, or, a, slice, of, fresh, homemade, bread, bread, is, associated, with, the, home, and, the, hearth, as, well, as, with, industry, and, the, taming, of, nature, and, as, such, seems, to, be, disliked, by, some, types, of, fairies, on, the, other, hand, in, much, of, the, celtic, folklore, baked, goods, are, a, traditional, offering, to, the, folk, as, are, cream, and, butter, the, prototype, of, food, and, therefore, a, symbol, of, life, bread, was, one, of, the, commonest, protections, against, fairies, before, going, out, into, a, fairy, haunted, place, it, was, customary, to, put, a, piece, of, dry, bread, in, one, s, pocket, in, county, wexford, ireland, in, 1882, it, was, reported, that, if, an, infant, is, carried, out, after, dark, a, piece, of, bread, is, wrapped, in, its, bib, or, dress, and, this, protects, it, from, any, witchcraft, or, evil, bells, also, have, an, ambiguous, role, while, they, protect, against, fairies, the, fairies, riding, on, horseback, such, as, the, fairy, queen, often, have, bells, on, their, harness, this, may, be, a, distinguishing, trait, between, the, seelie, court, from, the, unseelie, court, such, that, fairies, use, them, to, protect, themselves, from, more, wicked, members, of, their, race, another, ambiguous, piece, of, folklore, revolves, about, poultry, a, cock, s, crow, drove, away, fairies, but, other, tales, recount, fairies, keeping, poultry, while, many, fairies, will, confuse, travelers, on, the, path, the, will, o, the, wisp, can, be, avoided, by, not, following, it, certain, locations, known, to, be, haunts, of, fairies, are, to, be, avoided, c, s, lewis, reported, hearing, of, a, cottage, more, feared, for, its, reported, fairies, than, its, reported, ghost, in, particular, digging, in, fairy, hills, was, unwise, paths, that, the, fairies, travel, are, also, wise, to, avoid, home, owners, have, knocked, corners, from, houses, because, the, corner, blocked, the, fairy, path, and, cottages, have, been, built, with, the, front, and, back, doors, in, line, so, that, the, owners, could, in, need, leave, them, both, open, and, let, the, fairies, troop, through, all, night, locations, such, as, fairy, forts, were, left, undisturbed, even, cutting, brush, on, fairy, forts, was, reputed, to, be, the, death, of, those, who, performed, the, act, fairy, trees, such, as, thorn, trees, were, dangerous, to, chop, down, one, such, tree, was, left, alone, in, scotland, though, it, prevented, a, road, from, being, widened, for, seventy, years, other, actions, were, believed, to, offend, fairies, brownies, were, known, to, be, driven, off, by, being, given, clothing, though, some, folktales, recounted, that, they, were, offended, by, the, inferior, quality, of, the, garments, given, and, others, merely, stated, it, some, even, recounting, that, the, brownie, was, delighted, with, the, gift, and, left, with, it, other, brownies, left, households, or, farms, because, they, heard, a, complaint, or, a, compliment, people, who, saw, the, fairies, were, advised, not, to, look, closely, because, they, resented, infringements, on, their, privacy, the, need, to, not, offend, them, could, lead, to, problems, one, farmer, found, that, fairies, threshed, his, corn, but, the, threshing, continued, after, all, his, corn, was, gone, and, he, concluded, that, they, were, stealing, from, his, neighbors, leaving, him, the, choice, between, offending, them, dangerous, in, itself, and, profiting, by, the, theft, millers, were, thought, by, the, scots, to, be, no, canny, owing, to, their, ability, to, control, the, forces, of, nature, such, as, fire, in, the, kiln, water, in, the, burn, and, for, being, able, to, set, machinery, a, whirring, superstitious, communities, sometimes, believed, that, the, miller, must, be, in, league, with, the, fairies, in, scotland, fairies, were, often, mischievous, and, to, be, feared, no, one, dared, to, set, foot, in, the, mill, or, kiln, at, night, as, it, was, known, that, the, fairies, brought, their, corn, to, be, milled, after, dark, so, long, as, the, locals, believed, this, the, miller, could, sleep, secure, in, the, knowledge, that, his, stores, were, not, being, robbed, john, fraser, the, miller, of, whitehill, claimed, to, have, hidden, and, watched, the, fairies, trying, unsuccessfully, to, work, the, mill, he, said, he, decided, to, come, out, of, hiding, and, help, them, upon, which, one, of, the, fairy, women, gave, him, a, gowpen, double, handful, of, meal, and, told, him, to, put, it, in, his, empty, girnal, store, saying, that, the, store, would, remain, full, for, a, long, time, no, matter, how, much, he, took, out, it, is, also, believed, that, to, know, the, name, of, a, particular, fairy, a, person, could, summon, it, and, force, it, to, do, their, bidding, the, name, could, be, used, as, an, insult, towards, the, fairy, in, question, but, it, could, also, rather, contradictorily, be, used, to, grant, powers, and, gifts, to, the, user, before, the, advent, of, modern, medicine, many, physiological, conditions, were, untreatable, and, when, children, were, born, with, abnormalities, it, was, common, to, blame, the, fairies, sometimes, fairies, are, described, as,

pleasant, now, he, feared, that, the, fairies, would, pay, him, as, their, teind, tithe, to, hell, sir, orfeo, tells, how, sir, orfeo, s, wife, was, kidnapped, by, the, king, of, faerie, and, only, by, trickery, and, an, excellent, harping, ability, was, he, able, to, win, her, back, sir, degare, narrates, the, tale, of, a, woman, overcome, by, her, fairy, lover, who, in, later, versions, of, the, story, is, unmasked, as, a, mortal, thomas, the, rhymer, shows, thomas, escaping, with, less, difficulty, but, he, spends, seven, years, in, elfland, ois, n, is, harmed, not, by, his, stay, in,

later, although, only, some, of, his, men, crumbled, to, dust, on, dismounting, herla, and, his, men, who, did, not, dismount, were, trapped, on, horseback, this, being, one, account, of, the, origin,

of, artists, turned, to, painting, fairy, themes, most, christians, have, been, negative, or, skeptical, regarding, creatures, such, as, fairies, or, nature, spirits, but, a, minority, of, christian, thinkers, have, advocated, for, the, reality, of, fairies, in, positive, terms, one, early, example, is, origen, of, alexandria, in, contra, celsum, 8, 31, from, about, the, year, 248, we, indeed, also, maintain, with, regard, not, only, to, the, fruits, of, the, earth, but, to, every, flowing, stream, and, every, breath, of, air, that, the, ground, brings, forth, those, things, which, are, said, to, grow, up, naturally, that, the, water, springs, in, fountains, and, refreshes, the, earth, with, running, streams, that, the, air, is, kept, pure, and, supports, the, life, of, those, who, breathe, it, only, in, consequence, of, the, agency, and, control, of, certain, beings, whom, we, may, call, invisible, husbandmen, and, guardians, but, we, deny, that, those, invisible, agents, are, demons, about, a, century, later, c, 335, athanasius, of, alexandria, gives, an, exclusively, negative, assessment, of, these, same, creatures, on, the, incarnation, 8, 47, as, simply, demons, taking, up, their, abode, in, springs, or, rivers, or, trees, or, stones, and, imposing, upon, simple, people, by, their, frauds, while, such, negative, or, skeptical, ideas, remained, the, majority, positions, for, christians, some, exceptions, can, be, found, such, as, the, scottish, minister, robert, kirk, who, wrote, the, secret, commonwealth, of, elves, fauns, and, fairies, in, the, later, seventeenth, century, 1893, in, the, modern, era, c, s, lewis, writes, about, the, possibility, of, fairies, being, real, in, the, longaevi, the, long, livers, or, long, lived, ones, in, his, book, the, discarded, image, lewis, also, shared, this, account, of, comments, by, j, r, r, tolkien, within, a, letter, to, arthur, greeves, 22, june, 1930, tolkien, once, remarked, to, me, that, the, feeling, about, home, must, have, been, quite, different, in, the, days, when, a, family, had, fed, on, the, produce, of, the, same, few, miles, of, country, for, six, generations, and, that, perhaps, this, was, why, they, saw, nymphs, in, the, fountains, and, dryads, in, the, woods, they, were, not, mistaken, for, there, was, in, a, sense, a, real, not, metaphorical, connection, between, them, and, the, countryside, what, had, been, earth, and, air, and, later, corn, and, later, still, bread, really, was, in, them, we, of, course, who, live, on, a, standardised, international, diet, you, may, have, had, canadian, flour, english, meat, scotch, oatmeal, african, oranges, australian, wine, to, day, are, really, artificial, beings, and, have, no, connection, save, in, sentiment, with, any, place, on, earth, we, are, synthetic, men, uprooted, the, strength, of, the, hills, is, not, ours, tolkien, shares, more, about, the, possible, reality, of, fairies, in, a, manuscript, published, posthumously, if, fairies, really, exist, independently, of, men, then, very, few, of, our, fairy, stories, have, any, relation, to, them, they, are, a, quite, separate, creation, living, in, another, mode, they, appear, to, us, in, human, form, with, hands, faces, voices, and, language, similar, to, our, own, this, may, be, their, real, form, and, their, difference, reside, in, something, other, than, form, or, it, may, be, probably, is, only, the, way, in, which, their, presence, affects, us, rabbits, and, eagles, may, be, aware, of, them, quite, otherwise, for, lack, of, a, better, word, they, may, be, called, spirits, daemons, inherent, powers, of, the, created, world, deriving, more, directly, and, earlier, in, terrestrial, history, from, the, creating, will, of, god, but, nonetheless, created, christian, theologians, john, milbank, and, david, bentley, hart, have, spoken, and, written, about, the, real, existence, of, fairies, as, has, the, christian, philosopher, stephen, r, l, clark, hart, was, a, 2015, templeton, fellow, at, the, university, of, notre, dame, institute, for, advanced, study, and, has, published, the, most, on, this, topic, including, references, in, multiple, interviews, and, books, especially, roland, in, moonlight, for, example, hart, has, written, of, course, mermaids, exist, or, to, be, more, precise, of, course, water, spirits, and, magical, marine, beings, of, every, kind, are, real, and, numerous, and, in, certain, circumstances, somewhat, dangerous, the, modern, reports, of, real, encounters, with, mermaids, or, other, water, spirits, such, as, two, from, zimbabwe, one, from, south, africa, three, from, northeastern, india, and, so, on, are, so, ingenuous, well, attested, and, credible, that, only, a, brute, would, refuse, to, believe, them, there, is, a, real, moral, imperative, in, not, dismissing, such, tales, as, lies, or, delusions
