the, christian, doctrine, of, the, trinity, latin, trinitas, lit, triad, from, latin, trinus, threefold, is, the, central, doctrine, concerning, the, nature, of, god, in, most, christian, churches, which, defines, one, god, existing, in, three, coequal, coeternal, consubstantial, divine, persons, god, the, father, god, the, son, jesus, christ, and, god, the, holy, spirit, three, distinct, persons, hypostases, sharing, one, essence, substance, nature, homoousion, as, the, fourth, lateran, council, declared, it, is, the, father, who, begets, the, son, who, is, begotten, and, the, holy, spirit, who, proceeds, in, this, context, one, essence, nature, defines, what, god, is, while, the, three, persons, define, who, god, is, this, expresses, at, once, their, distinction, and, their, indissoluble, unity, thus, the, entire, process, of, creation, and, grace, is, viewed, as, a, single, shared, action, of, the, three, divine, persons, in, which, each, person, manifests, the, attributes, unique, to, them, in, the, trinity, thereby, proving, that, everything, comes, from, the, father, through, the, son, and, in, the, holy, spirit, this, doctrine, is, called, trinitarianism, and, its, adherents, are, called, trinitarians, while, its, opponents, are, called, antitrinitarians, or, nontrinitarians, christian, nontrinitarian, positions, include, unitarianism, binitarianism, and, modalism, while, the, developed, doctrine, of, the, trinity, is, not, explicit, in, the, books, that, constitute, the, new, testament, the, new, testament, possesses, a, triadic, understanding, of, god, and, contains, a, number, of, trinitarian, formulas, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, was, first, formulated, among, the, early, christians, mid, 2nd, century, and, later, and, fathers, of, the, church, as, they, attempted, to, understand, the, relationship, between, jesus, and, god, in, their, scriptural, documents, and, prior, traditions, the, old, testament, has, been, interpreted, as, referring, to, the, trinity, in, many, places, for, example, in, the, genesis, creation, narrative, specifically, the, first, person, plural, pronouns, in, genesis, 1, 26, 27, and, genesis, 3, 22, let, us, make, man, in, our, image, the, man, is, become, as, one, of, us, then, god, said, let, us, make, man, in, our, image, after, our, likeness, and, let, them, have, dominion, over, the, fish, of, the, sea, and, over, the, birds, of, the, heavens, and, over, the, livestock, and, over, all, the, earth, and, over, every, creeping, thing, that, creeps, on, the, earth, then, the, lord, god, said, behold, the, man, has, become, like, one, of, us, in, knowing, good, and, evil, a, traditional, christian, interpretation, of, these, pronouns, is, that, they, refer, to, a, plurality, of, persons, within, the, godhead, biblical, commentator, victor, p, hamilton, outlines, several, interpretations, including, the, most, widely, held, among, biblical, scholars, which, is, that, the, pronouns, do, not, refer, to, other, persons, within, the, godhead, but, to, the, heavenly, court, of, isaiah, 6, theologians, meredith, kline, and, gerhard, von, rad, argue, for, this, view, as, von, rad, says, the, extraordinary, plural, let, us, is, to, prevent, one, from, referring, god, s, image, too, directly, to, god, the, lord, god, includes, himself, among, the, heavenly, beings, of, his, court, and, thereby, conceals, himself, in, this, majority, hamilton, notes, that, this, interpretation, assumes, that, genesis, 1, is, at, variance, with, isaiah, 40, 13, 14, who, has, measured, the, spirit, of, the, lord, or, what, man, shows, him, his, counsel, whom, did, he, consult, and, who, made, him, understand, who, taught, him, the, path, of, justice, and, taught, him, knowledge, and, showed, him, the, way, of, understanding, that, is, if, the, plural, pronouns, of, genesis, 1, teach, that, god, consults, and, creates, with, a, heavenly, court, then, it, contradicts, the, statement, in, isaiah, that, god, seeks, the, council, of, nobody, according, to, hamilton, the, best, interpretation, approaches, the, trinitarian, understanding, but, employs, less, direct, terminology, 133, following, d, j, a, clines, he, states, that, the, plural, reveals, a, duality, within, the, godhead, that, recalls, the, spirit, of, god, mentioned, in, verse, 2, and, the, spirit, of, god, was, hovering, over, the, face, of, the, waters, hamilton, also, says, that, it, is, unreasonable, to, assume, that, the, author, of, genesis, was, too, theologically, primitive, to, deal, with, such, a, concept, as, plurality, within, unity, 134, hamilton, thus, argues, for, a, framework, of, progressive, revelation, in, which, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, is, revealed, at, first, obscurely, then, plainly, in, the, new, testament, another, of, these, places, is, the, prophecy, about, the, messiah, in, isaiah, 9, the, messiah, is, called, wonderful, counselor, mighty, god, everlasting, father, prince, of, peace, some, christians, see, this, verse, as, meaning, the, messiah, will, represent, the, trinity, on, earth, this, is, because, counselor, is, a, title, for, the, holy, spirit, john, 14, 26, the, trinity, is, god, father, is, a, title, for, god, the, father, and, prince, of, peace, is, a, title, for, jesus, this, verse, is, also, used, to, support, the, deity, of, christ, another, verse, used, to, support, the, deity, of, christ, is, i, saw, in, the, night, visions, and, behold, with, the, clouds, of, heaven, there, came, one, like, a, son, of, man, and, he, came, to, the, ancient, of, days, and, was, presented, before, him, and, to, him, was, given, dominion, and, glory, and, a, kingdom, that, all, peoples, nations, and, languages, should, serve, him, his, dominion, is, an, everlasting, dominion, which, shall, not, pass, away, and, his, kingdom, one, that, shall, not, be, destroyed, this, is, because, both, the, ancient, of, days, god, the, father, and, the, son, of, man, jesus, matt, 16, 13, have, an, everlasting, dominion, which, is, ascribed, to, god, in, psalm, 145, 13, some, also, argue, then, the, lord, rained, on, sodom, and, gomorrah, sulfur, and, fire, from, the, lord, out, of, heaven, to, be, trinitarian, in, apparently, distinguishing, between, the, lord, in, heaven, and, the, lord, on, earth, people, also, see, the, trinity, when, the, old, testament, refers, to, god, s, word, psalm, 33, 6, his, spirit, isaiah, 61, 1, and, wisdom, proverbs, 9, 1, as, well, as, narratives, such, as, the, appearance, of, the, three, men, to, abraham, however, it, is, generally, agreed, among, trinitarian, christian, scholars, that, it, would, go, beyond, the, intention, and, spirit, of, the, old, testament, to, correlate, these, notions, directly, with, later, trinitarian, doctrine, some, church, fathers, believed, that, a, knowledge, of, the, mystery, was, granted, to, the, prophets, and, saints, of, the, old, testament, and, that, they, identified, the, divine, messenger, of, genesis, 16, 7, genesis, 21, 17, genesis, 31, 11, exodus, 3, 2, and, wisdom, of, the, sapiential, books, with, the, son, and, the, spirit, of, the, lord, with, the, holy, spirit, other, church, fathers, such, as, gregory, nazianzen, argued, in, his, orations, that, the, revelation, was, gradual, claiming, that, the, father, was, proclaimed, in, the, old, testament, openly, but, the, son, only, obscurely, because, it, was, not, safe, when, the, godhead, of, the, father, was, not, yet, acknowledged, plainly, to, proclaim, the, son, genesis, 18, 19, has, been, interpreted, by, christians, as, a, trinitarian, text, the, narrative, has, the, lord, appearing, to, abraham, who, was, visited, by, three, men, in, genesis, 19, the, two, angels, visited, lot, at, sodom, the, interplay, between, abraham, on, the, one, hand, and, the, lord, three, men, the, two, angels, on, the, other, was, an, intriguing, text, for, those, who, believed, in, a, single, god, in, three, persons, justin, martyr, and, john, calvin, similarly, interpreted, it, such, that, abraham, was, visited, by, god, who, was, accompanied, by, two, angels, justin, supposed, that, the, god, who, visited, abraham, was, distinguishable, from, the, god, who, remains, in, the, heavens, but, was, nevertheless, identified, as, the, monotheistic, god, justin, interpreted, the, god, who, visited, abraham, as, jesus, the, second, person, of, the, trinity, augustine, in, contrast, held, that, the, three, visitors, to, abraham, were, the, three, persons, of, the, trinity, he, saw, no, indication, that, the, visitors, were, unequal, as, would, be, the, case, in, justin, s, reading, then, in, genesis, 19, two, of, the, visitors, were, addressed, by, lot, in, the, singular, lot, said, to, them, not, so, my, lord, gen, 19, 18, augustine, saw, that, lot, could, address, them, as, one, because, they, had, a, single, substance, despite, the, plurality, of, persons, christians, interpret, the, theophanies, or, appearances, of, the, angel, of, the, lord, as, revelations, of, a, person, distinct, from, god, who, is, nonetheless, called, god, this, interpretation, is, found, in, christianity, as, early, as, justin, martyr, and, melito, of, sardis, and, reflects, ideas, that, were, already, present, in, philo, the, old, testament, theophanies, were, thus, seen, as, christophanies, each, a, preincarnate, appearance, of, the, messiah, while, the, developed, doctrine, of, the, trinity, is, not, explicit, in, the, books, that, constitute, the, new, testament, the, new, testament, contains, several, trinitarian, formulas, including, matthew, 28, 19, 2, corinthians, 13, 14, ephesians, 4, 4, 6, 1, peter, 1, 2, and, revelation, 1, 4, 6, reflection, by, early, christians, on, passages, such, as, the, great, commission, go, therefore, and, make, disciples, of, all, nations, baptizing, them, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, and, paul, the, apostle, s, blessing, the, grace, of, the, lord, jesus, christ, and, the, love, of, god, and, the, fellowship, of, the, holy, spirit, be, with, you, all, leading, theologians, across, history, in, attempting, to, articulate, the, relationship, between, the, father, son, and, holy, spirit, eventually, the, diverse, references, to, god, jesus, and, the, spirit, found, in, the, new, testament, were, brought, together, to, form, the, concept, of, the, trinity, one, godhead, subsisting, in, three, persons, and, one, substance, the, concept, of, the, trinity, was, used, to, oppose, alternative, views, of, how, the, three, are, related, and, to, defend, the, church, against, charges, of, worshiping, two, or, three, gods, modern, biblical, scholarship, largely, agrees, that, 1, john, 5, 7, seen, in, latin, and, greek, texts, after, the, 4th, century, and, found, in, later, translations, such, as, the, king, james, translation, cannot, be, found, in, the, oldest, greek, and, latin, texts, verse, 7, is, known, as, the, johannine, comma, which, most, scholars, agree, to, be, a, later, addition, by, a, later, copyist, or, what, is, termed, a, textual, gloss, and, not, part, of, the, original, text, this, verse, reads, because, there, are, three, in, heaven, that, testify, the, father, the, word, and, the, holy, spirit, and, these, three, are, one, this, verse, is, absent, from, the, ethiopic, aramaic, syriac, slavic, early, armenian, georgian, and, arabic, translations, of, the, greek, new, testament, it, is, primarily, found, in, latin, manuscripts, although, a, minority, of, greek, slavonic, and, late, armenian, manuscripts, contain, it, in, the, pauline, epistles, the, public, collective, devotional, patterns, towards, jesus, in, the, early, christian, community, are, reflective, of, paul, s, perspective, on, the, divine, status, of, jesus, in, what, scholars, have, termed, a, binitarian, pattern, or, shape, of, devotional, practice, worship, in, the, new, testament, in, which, god, and, jesus, are, thematized, and, invoked, jesus, receives, prayer, 1, corinthians, 1, 2, 2, corinthians, 12, 8, 9, the, presence, of, jesus, is, confessionally, invoked, by, believers, 1, corinthians, 16, 22, romans, 10, 9, 13, philippians, 2, 10, 11, people, are, baptized, in, jesus, name, 1, corinthians, 6, 11, romans, 6, 3, jesus, is, the, reference, in, christian, fellowship, for, a, religious, ritual, meal, the, lord, s, supper, 1, corinthians, 11, 17, 34, jesus, is, described, as, existing, in, the, very, form, of, god, philippians, 2, 6, and, having, the, fullness, of, the, deity, in, bodily, form, colossians, 2, 9, jesus, is, also, in, some, verses, directly, called, god, romans, 9, 5, titus, 2, 13, 2, peter, 1, 1, the, gospels, depict, jesus, as, human, through, most, of, their, narrative, but, ne, eventually, discovers, that, he, is, a, divine, being, manifest, in, flesh, and, the, point, of, the, texts, is, in, part, to, make, his, higher, nature, known, in, a, kind, of, intellectual, epiphany, in, the, gospels, jesus, is, described, as, forgiving, sins, leading, some, theologians, to, believe, jesus, is, portrayed, as, god, this, is, because, jesus, forgives, sins, on, the, behalf, of, others, people, normally, only, forgive, transgressions, against, oneself, the, teachers, of, the, law, next, to, jesus, recognizes, this, and, said, why, does, this, fellow, talk, like, that, he, s, blaspheming, who, can, forgive, sins, but, god, alone, mark, 2, 7, jesus, also, receives, proskynesis, in, the, aftermath, of, the, resurrection, a, greek, term, that, either, expresses, the, contemporary, social, gesture, of, bowing, to, a, superior, either, on, one, s, knees, or, in, full, prostration, in, matthew, 18, 26, a, slave, performs, to, his, master, so, that, he, would, not, be, sold, after, being, unable, to, pay, his, debts, the, term, can, also, refer, to, the, religious, act, of, devotion, towards, a, deity, while, jesus, receives, a, number, of, times, in, the, synoptic, gospels, only, a, few, can, be, said, to, refer, to, divine, worship, this, includes, matthew, 28, 16, 20, an, account, of, the, resurrected, jesus, receiving, worship, from, his, disciples, after, proclaiming, his, authority, over, the, cosmos, and, his, ever, continuing, presence, with, the, disciples, forming, an, inclusion, with, the, beginning, of, the, gospel, where, jesus, is, given, the, name, emmanuel, god, with, us, a, name, that, alludes, to, the, god, of, israel, s, ongoing, presence, with, his, followers, throughout, the, old, testament, genesis, 28, 15, deuteronomy, 20, 1, whereas, some, have, argued, that, matthew, 28, 19, was, an, interpolation, on, account, of, its, absence, from, the, first, few, centuries, of, early, christian, quotations, scholars, largely, accept, the, passage, as, authentic, due, to, its, supporting, manuscript, evidence, and, that, it, does, appear, to, be, either, quoted, in, the, didache, 7, 1, 3, or, at, least, reflected, in, the, didache, as, part, of, a, common, tradition, from, which, both, matthew, and, the, didache, emerged, jesus, receiving, divine, worship, in, the, post, resurrection, accounts, is, further, mirrored, in, luke, 24, 52, acts, depicts, the, early, christian, movement, as, a, public, cult, centered, around, jesus, in, several, passages, in, acts, it, is, common, for, individual, christians, to, call, upon, the, name, of, jesus, 9, 14, 21, 22, 16, an, idea, precedented, in, the, old, testament, descriptions, of, calling, on, the, name, of, yhwh, as, a, form, of, prayer, the, story, of, stephen, depicts, stephen, invoking, and, crying, out, to, jesus, in, the, final, moments, of, his, life, to, receive, his, spirit, 7, 59, 60, acts, further, describes, a, common, ritual, practice, inducting, new, members, into, the, early, jesus, sect, by, baptizing, them, in, jesus, name, 2, 38, 8, 16, 10, 48, 19, 5, according, to, dale, allison, acts, depicts, the, appearances, of, jesus, to, paul, as, a, divine, theophany, styled, on, and, identified, with, the, god, responsible, for, the, theophany, of, ezekiel, in, the, old, testament, the, gospel, of, john, has, been, seen, as, especially, aimed, at, emphasizing, jesus, divinity, presenting, jesus, as, the, logos, pre, existent, and, divine, from, its, first, words, in, the, beginning, was, the, word, and, the, word, was, with, god, and, the, word, was, god, john, 1, 1, the, gospel, of, john, ends, with, thomas, s, declaration, that, he, believed, jesus, was, god, my, lord, and, my, god, john, 20, 28, modern, scholars, agree, that, john, 1, 1, and, john, 20, 28, identify, jesus, with, god, however, in, a, 1973, journal, of, biblical, literature, article, philip, b, harner, professor, emeritus, of, religion, at, heidelberg, college, claimed, that, the, traditional, translation, of, john, 1, 1c, and, the, word, was, god, is, incorrect, he, endorses, the, new, english, bible, translation, of, john, 1, 1c, and, what, god, was, the, word, was, however, harner, s, claim, has, been, criticized, by, other, scholars, in, the, same, article, harner, also, noted, that, perhaps, the, clause, could, be, translated, the, word, had, the, same, nature, as, god, this, would, be, one, way, of, representing, john, s, thought, which, is, as, i, understand, it, that, the, logos, no, less, than, the, theos, had, the, nature, of, theos, which, in, his, case, means, the, word, is, as, fully, god, as, the, person, called, god, john, also, portrays, jesus, as, the, agent, of, creation, of, the, universe, some, have, suggested, that, john, presents, a, hierarchy, when, he, quotes, jesus, as, saying, the, father, is, greater, than, i, a, statement, which, was, appealed, to, by, nontrinitarian, groups, such, as, arianism, however, church, fathers, such, as, augustine, of, hippo, and, thomas, aquinas, argued, this, statement, was, to, be, understood, as, jesus, speaking, about, his, human, nature, prior, israelite, theology, held, that, the, spirit, is, merely, the, divine, presence, of, god, himself, whereas, orthodox, christian, theology, holds, that, the, holy, spirit, is, a, distinct, person, of, god, the, father, himself, this, development, begins, early, in, the, new, testament, as, the, spirit, of, god, receives, much, more, emphasis, and, description, comparably, than, it, had, in, earlier, jewish, writing, whereas, there, are, 75, references, to, the, spirit, within, the, old, testament, and, 35, identified, in, the, non, biblical, dead, sea, scrolls, the, new, testament, despite, its, significantly, shorter, length, mentions, the, spirit, 275, times, in, addition, to, its, larger, emphasis, and, importance, placed, on, the, spirit, in, the, new, testament, the, spirit, is, also, described, in, much, more, personalized, and, individualized, terms, than, earlier, larry, hurtado, writes, moreover, the, new, testament, references, often, portray, actions, that, seem, to, give, the, spirit, an, intensely, personal, quality, probably, more, so, than, in, old, testament, or, ancient, jewish, texts, so, for, example, the, spirit, drove, jesus, into, the, wilderness, mk, 1, 12, compare, led, in, mt, 4, 1, lk, 4, 1, and, paul, refers, to, the, spirit, interceding, for, believers, romans, 8, 26, 27, and, witnessing, to, believers, about, their, filial, status, with, god, romans, 8, 14, 16, to, cite, other, examples, of, this, in, acts, the, spirit, alerts, peter, to, the, arrival, of, visitors, from, cornelius, 10, 19, directs, the, church, in, antioch, to, send, forth, barnabas, and, saul, 13, 2, 4, guides, the, jerusalem, council, to, a, decision, about, gentile, converts, 15, 28, at, one, point, forbids, paul, to, missionize, in, asia, 16, 6, and, at, another, point, warns, paul, via, prophetic, oracles, of, trouble, ahead, in, jerusalem, 21, 11, the, holy, spirit, is, described, as, god, in, the, book, of, the, acts, of, the, apostles, but, peter, said, ananias, why, has, satan, filled, your, heart, to, lie, to, the, holy, spirit, and, to, keep, back, for, yourself, part, of, the, proceeds, of, the, land, 4, while, it, remained, unsold, did, it, not, remain, your, own, and, after, it, was, sold, was, it, not, at, your, disposal, why, is, it, that, you, have, contrived, this, deed, in, your, heart, you, have, not, lied, to, man, but, to, god, acts, 5, 3, 4, peter, first, says, ananias, is, lying, to, the, holy, spirit, he, then, says, he, is, lying, to, god, in, the, new, testament, the, spirit, is, not, portrayed, as, the, recipient, of, cultic, devotion, which, instead, is, typically, offered, to, god, the, father, and, to, the, risen, glorified, jesus, although, what, became, mainstream, christianity, subsequently, affirmed, the, propriety, of, including, the, spirit, as, the, recipient, of, worship, as, reflected, in, the, developed, form, of, the, nicene, creed, perhaps, the, closest, to, this, in, the, new, testament, is, in, matthew, 28, 19, and, 2, corinthians, 13, 14, which, describe, the, spirit, as, the, subject, of, religious, ritual, as, the, arian, controversy, was, dissipating, the, debate, moved, from, the, deity, of, jesus, christ, to, the, equality, of, the, holy, spirit, with, the, father, and, son, on, one, hand, the, pneumatomachi, sect, declared, that, the, holy, spirit, was, an, inferior, person, to, the, father, and, son, on, the, other, hand, the, cappadocian, fathers, argued, that, the, holy, spirit, was, equal, to, the, father, and, son, in, nature, or, substance, although, the, main, text, used, in, defense, of, the, deity, of, the, holy, spirit, was, matthew, 28, 19, cappadocian, fathers, such, as, basil, the, great, argued, from, other, verses, such, as, but, peter, said, ananias, why, has, satan, filled, your, heart, to, lie, to, the, holy, spirit, and, to, keep, back, for, yourself, part, of, the, proceeds, of, the, land, while, it, remained, unsold, did, it, not, remain, your, own, and, after, it, was, sold, was, it, not, at, your, disposal, why, is, it, that, you, have, contrived, this, deed, in, your, heart, you, have, not, lied, to, men, but, to, god, acts, 5, 3, 4, another, passage, the, cappadocian, fathers, quoted, from, was, by, the, word, of, the, lord, the, heavens, were, made, and, by, the, breath, of, his, mouth, all, their, host, psalm, 33, 6, according, to, their, understanding, because, breath, and, spirit, in, hebrew, are, both, ruach, psalm, 33, 6, is, revealing, the, roles, of, the, son, and, holy, spirit, as, co, creators, and, since, according, to, them, because, only, the, holy, god, can, create, holy, beings, such, as, the, angels, the, son, and, holy, spirit, must, be, god, yet, another, argument, from, the, cappadocian, fathers, to, prove, that, the, holy, spirit, is, of, the, same, nature, as, the, father, and, son, comes, from, for, who, knows, a, person, s, thoughts, except, the, spirit, of, that, person, which, is, in, him, so, also, no, one, comprehends, the, thoughts, of, god, except, the, spirit, of, god, 1, corinthians, 2, 11, they, reasoned, that, this, passage, proves, that, the, holy, spirit, has, the, same, relationship, to, god, as, the, spirit, within, us, has, to, us, the, cappadocian, fathers, also, quoted, do, you, not, know, that, you, are, god, s, temple, and, that, god, s, spirit, dwells, in, you, 1, corinthians, 3, 16, and, reasoned, that, it, would, be, blasphemous, for, an, inferior, being, to, take, up, residence, in, a, temple, of, god, thus, proving, that, the, holy, spirit, is, equal, with, the, father, and, the, son, they, also, combined, the, servant, does, not, know, what, his, master, is, doing, john, 15, 15, with, 1, corinthians, 2, 11, in, an, attempt, to, show, that, the, holy, spirit, is, not, the, slave, of, god, and, therefore, his, equal, the, pneumatomachi, contradicted, the, cappadocian, fathers, by, quoting, are, they, not, all, ministering, spirits, sent, out, to, serve, for, the, sake, of, those, who, are, to, inherit, salvation, hebrews, 1, 14, in, effect, arguing, that, the, holy, spirit, is, no, different, from, other, created, angelic, spirits, the, church, fathers, disagreed, saying, that, the, holy, spirit, is, greater, than, the, angels, since, the, holy, spirit, is, the, one, who, grants, the, foreknowledge, for, prophecy, 1, corinthians, 12, 8, 10, so, that, the, angels, could, announce, events, to, come, while, the, developed, doctrine, of, the, trinity, is, not, explicit, in, the, books, that, constitute, the, new, testament, it, was, first, formulated, as, early, christians, attempted, to, understand, the, relationship, between, jesus, and, god, in, their, scriptural, documents, and, prior, traditions, according, to, margaret, baker, trinitarian, theology, has, roots, in, pre, christian, palestinian, beliefs, about, angels, an, early, reference, to, the, three, persons, of, later, trinitarian, doctrines, appears, towards, the, end, of, the, first, century, where, clement, of, rome, rhetorically, asks, in, his, epistle, as, to, why, corruption, exists, among, some, in, the, christian, community, do, we, not, have, one, god, and, one, christ, and, one, gracious, spirit, that, has, been, poured, out, upon, us, and, one, calling, in, christ, 1, clement, 46, 6, a, similar, example, is, found, in, the, first, century, didache, which, directs, christians, to, baptize, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, ignatius, of, antioch, similarly, refers, to, all, three, persons, around, ad, 110, exhorting, obedience, to, christ, and, to, the, father, and, to, the, spirit, though, all, of, these, early, sources, do, reference, the, three, persons, of, the, trinity, none, articulate, full, divinity, equal, status, or, shared, being, as, elaborated, by, trinitarians, in, later, centuries, the, pseudonymous, ascension, of, isaiah, written, sometime, between, the, end, of, the, first, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, third, century, possesses, a, proto, trinitarian, view, such, as, in, its, narrative, of, how, the, inhabitants, of, the, sixth, heaven, sing, praises, to, the, primal, father, and, his, beloved, christ, and, the, holy, spirit, justin, martyr, ad, 100, c, 165, also, writes, in, the, name, of, god, the, father, and, lord, of, the, universe, and, of, our, saviour, jesus, christ, and, of, the, holy, spirit, justin, martyr, is, the, first, to, use, much, of, the, terminology, that, would, later, become, widespread, in, codified, trinitarian, theology, for, example, he, describes, that, the, son, and, father, are, the, same, being, ousia, and, yet, are, also, distinct, faces, prosopa, anticipating, the, three, persons, hypostases, that, come, with, tertullian, and, later, authors, justin, describes, how, jesus, the, son, is, distinguishable, from, the, father, but, also, derives, from, the, father, using, the, analogy, of, a, fire, representing, the, son, that, is, lit, from, its, source, a, torch, representing, the, father, at, another, point, justin, martyr, wrote, that, we, worship, him, with, reason, since, we, have, learned, that, he, is, the, son, of, the, living, god, himself, and, believe, him, to, be, in, second, place, and, the, prophetic, spirit, in, the, third, 1, apology, 13, cf, ch, 60, about, the, christian, baptism, he, wrote, that, in, the, name, of, god, the, father, and, lord, of, the, universe, and, of, our, saviour, jesus, christ, and, of, the, holy, spirit, they, then, receive, the, washing, with, water, highlighting, the, liturgical, use, of, a, trinitarian, formula, the, first, of, the, early, church, fathers, to, be, recorded, using, the, word, trinity, was, theophilus, of, antioch, writing, in, the, late, 2nd, century, he, defines, the, trinity, as, god, his, word, logos, and, his, wisdom, sophia, in, the, context, of, a, discussion, of, the, first, three, days, of, creation, following, the, early, christian, practice, of, identifying, the, holy, spirit, as, the, wisdom, of, god, the, first, defense, of, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, was, by, tertullian, who, was, born, around, 150, 160, ad, explicitly, defined, the, trinity, as, father, son, and, holy, spirit, and, defended, his, theology, against, praxeas, although, he, noted, that, the, majority, of, the, believers, in, his, day, found, issue, with, his, doctrine, st, justin, and, clement, of, alexandria, referenced, all, three, persons, of, the, trinity, in, their, doxologies, and, st, basil, likewise, in, the, evening, lighting, of, lamps, origen, of, alexandria, ad, 185, c, 253, has, often, been, interpreted, as, subordinationist, believing, in, shared, divinity, of, the, three, persons, but, not, in, co, equality, some, modern, researchers, have, argued, that, origen, might, have, actually, been, anti, subordinationist, and, that, his, own, trinitarian, theology, inspired, the, trinitarian, theology, of, the, later, cappadocian, fathers, the, concept, of, the, trinity, can, be, seen, as, developing, significantly, during, the, first, four, centuries, by, the, church, fathers, in, reaction, to, theological, interpretations, known, as, adoptionism, sabellianism, and, arianism, adoptionism, was, the, belief, that, jesus, was, an, ordinary, man, born, of, joseph, and, mary, who, became, the, christ, and, son, of, god, at, his, baptism, in, 269, the, synods, of, antioch, condemned, paul, of, samosata, for, his, adoptionist, theology, and, also, condemned, the, term, homoousios, of, the, same, being, in, the, modalist, sense, in, which, he, used, it, among, the, nontrinitarian, beliefs, sabellianism, taught, that, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, are, essentially, one, and, the, same, the, difference, being, simply, verbal, describing, different, aspects, or, roles, of, a, single, being, for, this, view, sabellius, was, excommunicated, for, heresy, in, rome, c, 220, in, the, fourth, century, arianism, as, traditionally, understood, taught, that, the, father, existed, prior, to, the, son, who, was, not, by, nature, god, but, rather, a, changeable, creature, who, was, granted, the, dignity, of, becoming, son, of, god, in, 325, the, first, council, of, nicaea, adopted, the, nicene, creed, which, described, christ, as, god, of, god, light, of, light, very, god, of, very, god, begotten, not, made, being, of, one, substance, with, the, father, and, the, holy, ghost, as, the, one, by, which, was, incarnate, of, the, virgin, mary, the, word, was, made, flesh, and, dwelled, among, us, about, the, father, and, the, son, the, creed, used, the, term, homoousios, of, one, substance, to, define, the, relationship, between, the, father, and, the, son, after, more, than, fifty, years, of, debate, homoousios, was, recognised, as, the, hallmark, of, orthodoxy, and, was, further, developed, into, the, formula, of, three, persons, one, being, the, confession, of, the, first, council, of, nicaea, the, nicene, creed, said, little, about, the, holy, spirit, at, the, first, council, of, nicea, 325, all, attention, was, focused, on, the, relationship, between, the, father, and, the, son, without, making, any, similar, statement, about, the, holy, spirit, in, the, words, of, the, creed, we, believe, in, one, god, the, father, almighty, maker, of, all, things, visible, and, invisible, and, in, one, lord, jesus, christ, the, son, of, god, begotten, of, the, father, light, of, light, very, god, of, very, god, begotten, not, made, being, of, one, substance, with, the, father, and, in, the, holy, ghost, later, at, the, first, council, of, constantinople, 381, the, nicene, creed, would, be, expanded, known, as, niceno, constantinopolitan, creed, by, saying, that, the, holy, spirit, is, worshiped, and, glorified, together, with, the, father, and, the, son, suggesting, that, he, was, also, consubstantial, with, them, we, believe, in, one, god, the, father, almighty, maker, of, heaven, and, earth, and, of, all, things, visible, and, invisible, and, in, one, lord, jesus, christ, the, only, begotten, son, of, god, begotten, of, the, father, before, all, worlds, ons, light, of, light, very, god, of, very, god, begotten, not, made, being, of, one, substance, with, the, father, and, in, the, holy, ghost, the, lord, and, giver, of, life, who, proceedeth, from, the, father, who, with, the, father, and, the, son, together, is, worshiped, and, glorified, who, spake, by, the, prophets, the, doctrine, of, the, divinity, and, personality, of, the, holy, spirit, was, developed, by, athanasius, in, the, last, decades, of, his, life, he, defended, and, refined, the, nicene, formula, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, under, the, leadership, of, basil, of, caesarea, gregory, of, nyssa, and, gregory, of, nazianzus, the, cappadocian, fathers, the, doctrine, had, reached, substantially, its, current, form, gregory, of, nazianzus, gregory, of, nyssa, and, basil, the, great, account, for, the, trinity, saw, that, the, distinctions, between, the, three, divine, persons, were, solely, in, their, inner, divine, relations, there, are, not, three, gods, god, is, one, divine, being, in, three, persons, where, the, cappadocian, fathers, used, social, analogies, to, describe, the, triune, nature, of, god, augustine, of, hippo, used, psychological, analogy, he, believed, that, if, man, is, created, in, the, image, of, god, he, is, created, in, the, image, of, the, trinity, augustine, s, analogy, for, the, trinity, is, the, memory, intelligence, and, will, in, the, mind, of, a, man, in, short, christians, do, not, have, to, think, of, three, persons, when, they, think, of, god, they, may, think, of, one, person, in, the, late, 6th, century, some, latin, speaking, churches, added, the, words, and, from, the, son, filioque, to, the, description, of, the, procession, of, the, holy, spirit, words, that, were, not, included, in, the, text, by, either, the, council, of, nicaea, or, that, of, constantinople, this, was, incorporated, into, the, liturgical, practice, of, rome, in, 1014, filioque, eventually, became, one, of, the, main, causes, for, the, east, west, schism, in, 1054, and, the, failures, of, the, repeated, union, attempts, gregory, of, nazianzus, would, say, of, the, trinity, no, sooner, do, i, conceive, of, the, one, than, i, am, illumined, by, the, splendour, of, the, three, no, sooner, do, i, distinguish, three, than, i, am, carried, back, into, the, one, when, i, think, of, any, of, the, three, i, think, of, him, as, the, whole, and, my, eyes, are, filled, and, the, greater, part, of, what, i, am, thinking, escapes, me, i, cannot, grasp, the, greatness, of, that, one, so, as, to, attribute, a, greater, greatness, to, the, rest, when, i, contemplate, the, three, together, i, see, but, one, torch, and, cannot, divide, or, measure, out, the, undivided, light, devotion, to, the, trinity, centered, in, the, french, monasteries, at, tours, and, aniane, where, benedict, of, aniane, dedicated, the, abbey, church, to, the, trinity, in, 872, feast, days, were, not, instituted, until, 1091, at, cluny, and, 1162, at, canterbury, and, papal, resistance, continued, until, 1331, baptism, is, generally, conferred, with, the, trinitarian, formula, in, the, name, of, the, father, and, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, trinitarians, identify, this, name, with, the, christian, faith, into, which, baptism, is, an, initiation, as, seen, for, example, in, the, statement, of, basil, the, great, 330, 379, we, are, bound, to, be, baptized, in, the, terms, we, have, received, and, to, profess, faith, in, the, terms, in, which, we, have, been, baptized, the, first, council, of, constantinople, 381, also, says, this, is, the, faith, of, our, baptism, that, teaches, us, to, believe, in, the, name, of, the, father, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, according, to, this, faith, there, is, one, godhead, power, and, being, of, the, father, of, the, son, and, of, the, holy, spirit, may, be, taken, to, indicate, that, baptism, was, associated, with, this, formula, from, the, earliest, decades, of, the, church, s, existence, other, trinitarian, formulas, found, in, the, new, testament, include, in, 2, corinthians, 13, 14, 1, corinthians, 12, 4, 6, ephesians, 4, 4, 6, 1, peter, 1, 2, and, revelation, 1, 4, 5, oneness, pentecostals, demur, from, the, trinitarian, view, of, baptism, and, emphasize, baptism, in, the, name, of, jesus, christ, only, what, they, hold, to, be, the, original, apostolic, formula, for, this, reason, they, often, focus, on, the, baptisms, in, acts, those, who, place, great, emphasis, on, the, baptisms, in, acts, often, likewise, question, the, authenticity, of, matthew, 28, 19, in, its, present, form, most, scholars, of, new, testament, textual, criticism, accept, the, authenticity, of, the, passage, since, there, are, no, variant, manuscripts, regarding, the, formula, and, the, extant, form, of, the, passage, is, attested, in, the, didache, and, other, patristic, works, of, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, ignatius, tertullian, hippolytus, cyprian, and, gregory, thaumaturgus, commenting, on, matthew, 28, 19, gerhard, kittel, states, this, threefold, relation, soon, found, fixed, expression, in, the, triadic, formulae, in, 2, corinthians, 13, 14, and, in, 1, corinthians, 12, 4, 6, the, form, is, first, found, in, the, baptismal, formula, in, matthew, 28, 19, did, 7, 1, and, 3, t, is, self, evident, that, father, son, and, spirit, are, here, linked, in, an, indissoluble, threefold, relationship, in, trinitarian, doctrine, god, exists, as, three, persons, but, is, one, being, having, a, single, divine, nature, the, members, of, the, trinity, are, co, equal, and, co, eternal, one, in, essence, nature, power, action, and, will, as, stated, in, the, athanasian, creed, the, father, is, uncreated, the, son, is, uncreated, and, the, holy, spirit, is, uncreated, and, all, three, are, eternal, without, beginning, the, father, and, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, are, not, names, for, different, parts, of, god, but, one, name, for, god, because, three, persons, exist, in, god, as, one, entity, they, cannot, be, separate, from, one, another, each, person, is, understood, as, having, the, identical, essence, or, nature, not, merely, similar, natures, according, to, the, eleventh, council, of, toledo, 675, for, when, we, say, he, who, is, the, father, is, not, the, son, we, refer, to, the, distinction, of, persons, but, when, we, say, the, father, is, that, which, the, son, is, the, son, that, which, the, father, is, and, the, holy, spirit, that, which, the, father, is, and, the, son, is, this, clearly, refers, to, the, nature, or, substance, the, fourth, lateran, council, 1215, adds, therefore, in, god, there, is, only, a, trinity, not, a, quaternity, since, each, of, the, three, persons, is, that, reality, that, is, to, say, substance, essence, or, divine, nature, which, alone, is, the, principle, of, all, things, besides, which, no, other, principle, can, be, found, this, reality, neither, begets, nor, is, begotten, nor, proceeds, the, father, begets, the, son, is, begotten, and, the, holy, spirit, proceeds, thus, there, is, a, distinction, of, persons, but, a, unity, of, nature, although, therefore, the, father, is, one, person, the, son, another, person, and, the, holy, spirit, another, person, they, are, not, different, realities, but, rather, that, which, is, the, father, is, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, altogether, the, same, thus, according, to, the, orthodox, and, catholic, faith, they, are, believed, to, be, consubstantial, clarification, of, the, relationships, among, the, three, trinitarian, persons, divine, persons, different, from, the, sense, of, a, human, self, advanced, in, the, magisterial, statement, promulgated, by, the, council, of, florence, 1431, 1449, though, its, formulation, precedes, the, council, these, three, persons, are, one, god, and, not, three, gods, for, the, three, are, one, substance, one, essence, one, nature, one, godhead, one, infinity, one, eternity, and, everything, in, them, is, one, where, there, is, no, opposition, of, relationship, robert, magliola, explains, that, most, theologians, have, taken, relationis, oppositio, in, the, thomist, sense, namely, the, opposition, of, relationship, is, one, of, contrariety, rather, than, contradiction, the, only, functions, that, are, applied, uniquely, to, the, father, son, and, holy, spirit, respectively, in, scripture, are, the, following, paternity, to, the, father, filiation, sonship, to, the, son, and, passive, spiration, or, that, which, is, breathed, out, to, the, holy, spirit, magliola, goes, on, to, explain, because, such, is, the, case, among, other, reasons, karl, rahner, rejects, the, psychological, theories, of, trinity, which, define, the, father, as, knower, for, example, and, the, son, as, the, known, i, e, truth, scripture, in, one, place, or, another, identifies, knowing, with, each, of, the, three, persons, all, told, which, is, to, say, according, to, the, relationis, oppositio, knowing, in, our, example, does, not, define, the, persons, at, all, but, the, unity, of, god, instead, scripture, s, attribution, of, knowing, to, any, one, person, at, any, one, time, is, said, to, be, just, appropriated, to, the, person, it, does, not, really, belong, to, that, unique, person, magliola, continuing, the, rahnerian, stance, goes, on, to, explain, that, the, divine, persons, necessarily, relate, to, each, other, in, terms, of, pure, negative, reference, that, is, the, three, is, not, relations, represented, in, the, scutum, fidei, diagram, are, in, each, case, a, pure, or, absolute, is, not, this, is, the, case, because, the, relationis, oppositio, clause, disallows, the, persons, to, share, qua, persons, the, unique, role, that, defines, each, of, them, lest, he, be, misunderstood, magliola, in, a, subsequent, publication, makes, sure, to, specify, that, each, of, the, three, persons, while, unique, as, a, person, is, nonetheless, because, of, the, divine, consubstantiality, and, simplicity, the, one, reality, that, is, god, there, have, been, some, different, understandings, of, the, trinity, among, christian, theologians, and, denominations, including, questions, on, issues, such, as, filioque, subordinationism, eternal, generation, of, the, son, and, social, trinitarianism, perichoresis, from, greek, going, around, envelopment, is, a, term, used, by, some, scholars, to, describe, the, relationship, among, the, members, of, the, trinity, the, latin, equivalent, for, this, term, is, circumincessio, this, concept, refers, for, its, basis, to, john, 10, 38, 14, 11, 14, 20, where, jesus, is, instructing, the, disciples, concerning, the, meaning, of, his, departure, his, going, to, the, father, he, says, is, for, their, sake, so, that, he, might, come, to, them, when, the, other, comforter, is, given, to, them, then, he, says, his, disciples, will, dwell, in, him, as, he, dwells, in, the, father, and, the, father, dwells, in, him, and, the, father, will, dwell, in, them, this, is, so, according, to, the, theory, of, perichoresis, because, the, persons, of, the, trinity, reciprocally, contain, one, another, so, that, one, permanently, envelopes, and, is, permanently, enveloped, by, the, other, whom, he, yet, envelopes, hilary, of, poitiers, concerning, the, trinity, 3, 1, the, most, prominent, exponent, of, perichoresis, was, john, of, damascus, d, 749, who, employed, the, concept, as, a, technical, term, to, describe, both, the, interpenetration, of, the, divine, and, human, natures, of, christ, and, the, relationship, between, the, hypostases, of, the, trinity, perichoresis, effectively, excludes, the, idea, that, god, has, parts, but, rather, is, a, simple, being, it, also, harmonizes, well, with, the, doctrine, that, the, christian, s, union, with, the, son, in, his, humanity, brings, him, into, union, with, one, who, contains, in, himself, in, paul, s, words, all, the, fullness, of, deity, and, not, a, part, perichoresis, provides, an, intuitive, figure, of, what, this, might, mean, the, son, the, eternal, word, is, from, all, eternity, the, dwelling, place, of, god, he, is, the, father, s, house, just, as, the, son, dwells, in, the, father, and, the, spirit, so, that, when, the, spirit, is, given, then, it, happens, as, jesus, said, i, will, not, leave, you, as, orphans, for, i, will, come, to, you, the, term, immanent, trinity, focuses, on, who, god, is, the, term, economic, trinity, focuses, on, what, god, does, according, to, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, the, fathers, of, the, church, distinguish, between, theology, theologia, and, economy, oikonomia, theology, refers, to, the, mystery, of, god, s, inmost, life, within, the, blessed, trinity, and, economy, to, all, the, works, by, which, god, reveals, himself, and, communicates, his, life, through, the, oikonomia, the, theologia, is, revealed, to, us, but, conversely, the, theologia, illuminates, the, whole, oikonomia, god, s, works, reveal, who, he, is, in, himself, the, mystery, of, his, inmost, being, enlightens, our, understanding, of, all, his, works, so, it, is, analogously, among, human, persons, a, person, discloses, himself, in, his, actions, and, the, better, we, know, a, person, the, better, we, understand, his, actions, the, whole, divine, economy, is, the, common, work, of, the, three, divine, persons, for, as, the, trinity, has, only, one, and, the, same, natures, so, too, does, it, have, only, one, and, the, same, operation, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, are, not, three, principles, of, creation, but, one, principle, however, each, divine, person, performs, the, common, work, according, to, his, unique, personal, property, thus, the, church, confesses, following, the, new, testament, one, god, and, father, from, whom, all, things, are, and, one, lord, jesus, christ, through, whom, all, things, are, and, one, holy, spirit, in, whom, all, things, are, it, is, above, all, the, divine, missions, of, the, son, s, incarnation, and, the, gift, of, the, holy, spirit, that, show, forth, the, properties, of, the, divine, persons, the, ancient, nicene, theologians, argued, that, everything, the, trinity, does, is, done, by, father, son, and, spirit, working, in, unity, with, one, will, the, three, persons, of, the, trinity, always, work, inseparably, for, their, work, is, always, the, work, of, the, one, god, the, son, s, will, cannot, be, different, from, the, father, s, because, it, is, the, father, s, they, have, but, one, will, as, they, have, but, one, being, otherwise, they, would, not, be, one, god, on, this, point, st, basil, said, when, then, he, says, i, have, not, spoken, of, myself, and, again, as, the, father, said, unto, me, so, i, speak, and, the, word, which, ye, hear, is, not, mine, but, which, sent, me, and, in, another, place, as, the, father, gave, me, commandment, even, so, i, do, it, is, not, because, he, lacks, deliberate, purpose, or, power, of, initiation, nor, yet, because, he, has, to, wait, for, the, preconcerted, key, note, that, he, employs, language, of, this, kind, his, object, is, to, make, it, plain, that, his, own, will, is, connected, in, indissoluble, union, with, the, father, do, not, then, let, us, understand, by, what, is, called, a, commandment, a, peremptory, mandate, delivered, by, organs, of, speech, and, giving, orders, to, the, son, as, to, a, subordinate, concerning, what, he, ought, to, do, let, us, rather, in, a, sense, befitting, the, godhead, perceive, a, transmission, of, will, like, the, reflexion, of, an, object, in, a, mirror, passing, without, note, of, time, from, father, to, son, according, to, thomas, aquinas, the, son, prayed, to, the, father, became, a, minor, to, the, angels, became, incarnate, obeyed, the, father, as, to, his, human, nature, as, to, his, divine, nature, the, son, remained, god, thus, then, the, fact, that, the, father, glorifies, raises, up, and, exalts, the, son, does, not, show, that, the, son, is, less, than, the, father, except, in, his, human, nature, for, in, the, divine, nature, by, which, he, is, equal, to, the, father, the, power, of, the, father, and, the, son, is, the, same, and, their, operation, is, the, same, aquinas, stated, that, the, mystery, of, the, son, cannot, be, explicitly, believed, to, be, true, without, faith, in, the, trinity, st, iia, iiae, 2, 7, resp, and, 8, resp, athanasius, of, alexandria, explained, that, the, son, is, eternally, one, in, being, with, the, father, temporally, and, voluntarily, subordinate, in, his, incarnate, ministry, such, human, traits, he, argued, were, not, to, be, read, back, into, the, eternal, trinity, likewise, the, cappadocian, fathers, also, insisted, there, was, no, economic, inequality, present, within, the, trinity, as, basil, wrote, we, perceive, the, operation, of, the, father, son, and, holy, spirit, to, be, one, and, the, same, in, no, respect, showing, differences, or, variation, from, this, identity, of, operation, we, necessarily, infer, the, unity, of, nature, the, traditional, theory, of, appropriation, consists, in, attributing, certain, names, qualities, or, operations, to, one, of, the, persons, of, the, trinity, not, however, to, the, exclusion, of, the, others, but, in, preference, to, the, others, this, theory, was, established, by, the, latin, fathers, of, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, especially, by, hilary, of, poitiers, augustine, and, leo, the, great, in, the, middle, ages, the, theory, was, systematically, taught, by, the, schoolmen, such, as, bonaventure, augustine, coupled, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, with, anthropology, proceeding, from, the, idea, that, humans, are, created, by, god, according, to, the, divine, image, he, attempted, to, explain, the, mystery, of, the, trinity, by, uncovering, traces, of, the, trinity, in, the, human, personality, the, first, key, of, his, exegesis, is, an, interpersonal, analogy, of, mutual, love, in, de, trinitate, 399, 419, he, wrote, we, are, now, eager, to, see, whether, that, most, excellent, love, is, proper, to, the, holy, spirit, and, if, it, is, not, so, whether, the, father, or, the, son, or, the, holy, trinity, itself, is, love, since, we, cannot, contradict, the, most, certain, faith, and, the, most, weighty, authority, of, scripture, which, says, god, is, love, the, bible, reveals, it, although, only, in, the, two, neighboring, verses, 1, john, 4, 8, 16, therefore, one, must, ask, if, love, itself, is, triune, augustine, found, that, it, is, and, consists, of, three, the, lover, the, beloved, and, the, love, reaffirming, the, theopaschite, formula, unus, de, trinitate, passus, est, carne, meaning, one, of, the, trinity, suffered, in, the, flesh, thomas, aquinas, wrote, that, jesus, suffered, and, died, as, to, his, human, nature, as, to, his, divine, nature, he, could, not, suffer, or, die, but, the, commandment, to, suffer, clearly, pertains, to, the, son, only, in, his, human, nature, and, the, way, in, which, christ, was, raised, up, is, like, the, way, he, suffered, and, died, that, is, in, the, flesh, for, it, says, in, 1, peter, 4, 1, christ, having, suffered, in, the, flesh, then, the, fact, that, the, father, glorifies, raises, up, and, exalts, the, son, does, not, show, that, the, son, is, less, than, the, father, except, in, his, human, nature, for, in, the, divine, nature, by, which, he, is, equal, to, the, father, in, the, 1900s, the, recovery, of, a, substantially, different, formula, of, theopaschism, took, place, at, least, unus, de, trinitate, passus, est, meaning, not, only, in, the, flesh, deeply, affected, by, the, atomic, bombs, event, as, early, as, 1946, the, lutheran, theologian, kazoh, kitamori, published, theology, of, the, pain, of, god, a, theology, of, the, cross, pushed, up, to, the, immanent, trinity, this, concept, was, later, taken, by, both, reformed, and, catholic, theology, in, 1971, by, j, rgen, moltmann, s, the, crucified, god, in, the, 1972, preface, to, the, second, edition, of, his, 1969, german, book, theologie, der, drei, tage, english, translation, the, mystery, of, easter, by, hans, urs, von, balthasar, who, took, a, cue, from, revelation, 13, 8, vulgate, agni, qui, occisus, est, ab, origine, mundi, niv, the, lamb, who, was, slain, from, the, creation, of, the, world, to, explore, the, god, is, love, idea, as, an, eternal, super, kenosis, in, the, words, of, von, balthasar, at, this, point, where, the, subject, undergoing, the, hour, is, the, son, speaking, with, the, father, the, controversial, theopaschist, formula, has, its, proper, place, one, of, the, trinity, has, suffered, the, formula, can, already, be, found, in, gregory, nazianzen, we, needed, a, crucified, god, but, if, theopaschism, indicates, only, a, christological, kenosis, or, kenotic, christology, instead, von, balthasar, supports, a, trinitarian, kenosis, the, persons, of, the, trinity, constitute, themselves, as, who, they, are, through, the, very, act, of, pouring, themselves, out, for, each, other, the, underlying, question, is, if, the, three, persons, of, the, trinity, can, live, a, self, love, amor, sui, as, well, as, if, for, them, with, the, conciliar, dogmatic, formulation, in, terms, that, today, we, would, call, ontotheological, it, is, possible, that, the, aseity, causa, sui, is, valid, if, the, father, is, not, the, son, or, the, spirit, since, the, generator, begetter, is, not, the, generated, begotten, nor, the, generation, generative, process, and, vice, versa, and, since, the, lover, is, neither, the, beloved, nor, the, love, dynamic, between, them, and, vice, versa, christianity, has, provided, as, a, response, a, concept, of, divine, ontology, and, love, different, from, common, sense, omnipotence, omnibenevolence, impassibility, etc, an, oblative, sacrificial, martyrizing, crucifying, precisely, kenotic, concept, benjamin, b, warfield, saw, a, principle, of, subordination, in, the, modes, of, operation, of, the, trinity, but, was, also, hesitant, to, ascribe, the, same, to, the, modes, of, subsistence, in, relation, of, one, to, another, while, noting, that, it, is, natural, to, see, a, subordination, in, function, as, reflecting, a, similar, subordination, in, substance, he, suggests, that, this, might, be, the, result, of, an, agreement, by, persons, of, the, trinity, a, covenant, as, it, is, technically, called, by, virtue, of, which, a, distinct, function, in, the, work, of, redemption, is, assumed, by, each, today, several, analogies, for, the, trinity, abound, the, comparison, is, sometimes, made, between, the, triune, god, and, h, 2, o, just, as, h, 2, o, can, come, in, three, distinct, forms, liquid, solid, gas, so, god, appears, as, father, son, spirit, the, mathematical, analogy, 1, 1, 1, 3, but, 1x1x1, 1, is, also, used, to, explain, the, trinity, according, to, eusebius, constantine, suggested, the, term, homoousios, at, the, council, of, nicaea, though, most, scholars, have, doubted, that, constantine, had, such, knowledge, and, have, thought, that, most, likely, hosius, had, suggested, the, term, to, him, constantine, later, changed, his, view, about, the, arians, who, opposed, the, nicene, formula, and, supported, the, bishops, who, rejected, the, formula, as, did, several, of, his, successors, the, first, emperor, to, be, baptized, in, the, nicene, faith, being, theodosius, the, great, emperor, from, 379, to, 395, christians, confess, that, the, trinity, is, fundamentally, incomprehensible, and, thus, christian, confessions, tend, to, maintain, the, doctrine, as, it, is, revealed, in, scripture, but, do, not, attempt, to, exhaustively, analyse, it, or, set, forth, its, essence, comprehensively, as, louis, berkhof, describes, in, his, systematic, theology, the, trinity, is, a, mystery, not, merely, in, the, biblical, sense, that, it, is, a, truth, which, is, formerly, hidden, but, is, now, revealed, but, in, the, sense, that, man, cannot, comprehend, it, and, make, it, intelligible, it, is, intelligible, in, some, of, its, relations, and, modes, of, manifestation, but, unintelligible, in, its, essential, nature, has, never, tried, to, explain, the, mystery, of, the, trinity, but, only, sought, to, formulate, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, in, such, a, manner, that, the, errors, which, endangered, it, were, warded, off, nontrinitarianism, or, antitrinitarianism, refers, to, christian, belief, systems, that, reject, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, as, found, in, the, nicene, creed, as, not, having, a, scriptural, origin, nontrinitarian, views, differ, widely, on, the, nature, of, god, jesus, and, the, holy, spirit, various, nontrinitarian, views, such, as, adoptionism, monarchianism, and, arianism, existed, prior, to, the, formal, definition, of, the, trinity, doctrine, in, ad, 325, 360, and, 431, at, the, councils, of, nicaea, constantinople, and, ephesus, respectively, following, the, adoption, of, trinitarianism, at, constantinople, in, 381, arianism, was, driven, from, the, empire, retaining, a, foothold, amongst, the, germanic, tribes, when, the, franks, converted, to, catholicism, in, 496, however, it, gradually, faded, out, nontrinitarianism, was, later, renewed, in, the, gnosticism, of, the, cathars, in, the, 11th, through, 13th, centuries, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, of, the, 18th, century, and, in, some, groups, arising, during, the, second, great, awakening, of, the, 19th, century, arianism, was, condemned, as, heretical, by, the, first, council, of, nicaea, and, lastly, with, sabellianism, by, the, second, ecumenical, council, constantinople, 381, ce, adoptionism, was, declared, as, heretical, by, the, ecumenical, council, of, frankfurt, convened, by, the, emperor, charlemagne, in, 794, for, the, latin, west, church, modern, nontrinitarian, groups, or, denominations, include, christadelphians, christian, science, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, dawn, bible, students, iglesia, ni, cristo, jehovah, s, witnesses, living, church, of, god, members, church, of, god, international, oneness, pentecostals, la, luz, del, mundo, the, seventh, day, church, of, god, unitarian, christians, united, church, of, god, and, the, shepherd, s, chapel, as, pointed, out, by, jonathan, israel, the, 17th, century, dutch, republic, was, more, religiously, tolerant, than, other, european, countries, of, the, time, but, its, dominant, calvinist, church, drew, the, line, at, groups, who, denied, the, trinity, this, was, considered, an, intolerable, aberration, and, such, groups, were, subject, to, various, forms, of, persecution, in, the, netherlands, john, william, colenso, argued, that, the, book, of, enoch, implies, a, trinitarian, esque, view, of, god, seeing, the, lord, of, the, spirits, the, elected, one, and, the, divine, power, each, partaking, of, the, name, of, god, judaism, maintains, a, tradition, of, monotheism, that, excludes, the, possibility, of, a, trinity, in, judaism, god, is, understood, to, be, the, absolute, one, indivisible, and, incomparable, being, which, is, the, ultimate, cause, of, all, existence, some, kabbalist, writings, have, a, trinitarian, esque, view, of, god, speaking, of, stages, of, god, s, being, aspects, of, the, divine, personality, with, god, being, three, hidden, lights, which, constitute, one, essence, and, one, root, some, jewish, philosophers, additionally, saw, god, as, a, thinker, thinking, and, thought, taking, from, augustinian, analogies, the, zohar, additionally, says, that, god, is, they, and, they, are, it, philo, of, alexandria, recognized, a, threefold, character, of, god, but, had, many, differences, from, the, christian, view, of, the, trinity, islam, considers, jesus, to, be, a, prophet, but, not, divine, and, god, to, be, absolutely, indivisible, a, concept, known, as, tawhid, several, verses, of, the, quran, state, that, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, is, blasphemous, indeed, disbelievers, have, said, truly, allah, is, messiah, son, of, mary, but, messiah, said, children, of, israel, worship, allah, my, lord, and, your, lord, indeed, whoever, associates, partners, with, allah, surely, allah, has, forbidden, them, from, heaven, and, fire, is, their, resort, and, there, are, no, helpers, for, the, wrongdoers, indeed, disbelievers, have, said, truly, allah, is, a, third, of, three, yet, there, is, no, god, except, one, god, and, if, they, do, not, desist, from, what, they, say, a, grievous, punishment, befalls, the, disbelievers, will, they, not, turn, to, allah, and, ask, his, forgiveness, for, allah, is, most, forgiving, and, merciful, is, not, messiah, son, of, mary, only, a, messenger, indeed, messengers, had, passed, away, prior, to, him, and, his, mother, was, an, upright, woman, they, both, ate, food, observe, how, we, explain, the, signs, for, them, then, observe, how, they, turn, away, from, truth, interpretation, of, these, verses, by, modern, scholars, has, been, varied, verse, 5, 73, has, been, interpreted, as, a, potential, criticism, of, syriac, literature, that, references, jesus, as, the, third, of, three, and, thus, an, attack, on, the, view, that, christ, was, divine, another, interpretation, is, that, this, passage, should, be, studied, from, a, rhetorical, perspective, so, as, not, to, be, an, error, but, an, intentional, misrepresentation, of, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, in, order, to, demonstrate, its, absurdity, from, an, islamic, perspective, david, thomas, states, that, verse, 5, 116, need, not, be, seen, as, describing, actually, professed, beliefs, but, rather, giving, examples, of, shirk, claiming, divinity, for, beings, other, than, god, and, a, warning, against, excessive, devotion, to, jesus, and, extravagant, veneration, of, mary, a, reminder, linked, to, the, central, theme, of, the, qur, an, that, there, is, only, one, god, and, he, alone, is, to, be, worshipped, when, read, in, this, light, it, can, be, understood, as, an, admonition, against, the, divinization, of, jesus, that, is, given, elsewhere, in, the, qur, an, and, a, warning, against, the, virtual, divinization, of, mary, in, the, declaration, of, the, fifth, century, church, councils, that, she, is, god, bearer, similarly, gabriel, reynolds, sidney, griffith, and, mun, im, sirry, argue, that, this, quranic, verse, is, to, be, understood, as, an, intentional, caricature, and, rhetorical, statement, to, warn, from, the, dangers, of, deifiying, jesus, or, mary, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, islamic, representation, of, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, may, derive, from, its, description, in, some, texts, of, manichaeism, where, we, encounter, a, trinity, consisting, of, a, father, a, mother, of, life, the, living, spirit, and, the, original, man, the, trinity, is, most, commonly, seen, in, christian, art, with, the, spirit, represented, by, a, dove, as, specified, in, the, gospel, accounts, of, the, baptism, of, christ, he, is, nearly, always, shown, with, wings, outspread, however, depictions, using, three, human, figures, appear, occasionally, in, most, periods, of, art, the, father, and, the, son, are, usually, differentiated, by, age, and, later, by, dress, but, this, too, is, not, always, the, case, the, usual, depiction, of, the, father, as, an, older, man, with, a, white, beard, may, derive, from, the, biblical, ancient, of, days, which, is, often, cited, in, defense, of, this, sometimes, controversial, representation, however, in, eastern, orthodoxy, the, ancient, of, days, is, usually, understood, to, be, god, the, son, not, god, the, father, see, below, early, byzantine, images, show, christ, as, the, ancient, of, days, but, this, iconography, became, rare, when, the, father, is, depicted, in, art, he, is, sometimes, shown, with, a, halo, shaped, like, an, equilateral, triangle, instead, of, a, circle, the, son, is, often, shown, at, the, father, s, right, hand, acts, 7, 56, he, may, be, represented, by, a, symbol, typically, the, lamb, agnus, dei, or, a, cross, or, on, a, crucifix, so, that, the, father, is, the, only, human, figure, shown, at, full, size, in, early, medieval, art, the, father, may, be, represented, by, a, hand, appearing, from, a, cloud, in, a, blessing, gesture, for, example, in, scenes, of, the, baptism, of, christ, later, in, the, west, the, throne, of, mercy, or, throne, of, grace, became, a, common, depiction, in, this, style, the, father, sometimes, seated, on, a, throne, is, shown, supporting, either, a, crucifix, or, later, a, slumped, crucified, son, similar, to, the, piet, this, type, is, distinguished, in, german, as, the, not, gottes, in, his, outstretched, arms, while, the, dove, hovers, above, or, in, between, them, this, subject, continued, to, be, popular, until, the, 18th, century, at, least, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, larger, representations, other, than, the, throne, of, mercy, became, effectively, standardised, showing, an, older, figure, in, plain, robes, for, the, father, christ, with, his, torso, partly, bare, to, display, the, wounds, of, his, passion, and, the, dove, above, or, around, them, in, earlier, representations, both, father, especially, and, son, often, wear, elaborate, robes, and, crowns, sometimes, the, father, alone, wears, a, crown, or, even, a, papal, tiara, in, the, later, part, of, the, christian, era, in, renaissance, european, iconography, the, eye, of, providence, began, to, be, used, as, an, explicit, image, of, the, christian, trinity, and, associated, with, the, concept, of, divine, providence, seventeenth, century, depictions, of, the, eye, of, providence, sometimes, show, it, surrounded, by, clouds, or, sunbursts, the, concept, of, the, trinity, was, made, visible, in, the, heiligen, geist, kapelle, in, bruck, an, der, mur, austria, with, a, ground, plan, of, an, equilateral, triangle, with, beveled, corners, the, trinity, has, traditionally, been, a, subject, matter, of, strictly, theological, works, focused, on, proving, the, doctrine, of, the, trinity, and, defending, it, against, its, critics, in, recent, years, however, the, trinity, has, made, an, entrance, into, the, world, of, christian, literature, through, books, such, as, the, shack, published, in, 2007, and, the, trinity, story, published, in, 2021
