in, folklore, a, mermaid, is, an, aquatic, creature, with, the, head, and, upper, body, of, a, female, human, and, the, tail, of, a, fish, mermaids, appear, in, the, folklore, of, many, cultures, worldwide, including, europe, asia, and, africa, mermaids, are, sometimes, associated, with, perilous, events, such, as, floods, storms, shipwrecks, and, drownings, in, other, folk, traditions, or, sometimes, within, the, same, traditions, they, can, be, benevolent, or, beneficent, bestowing, boons, or, falling, in, love, with, humans, the, male, equivalent, of, the, mermaid, is, the, merman, also, a, familiar, figure, in, folklore, and, heraldry, although, traditions, about, and, reported, sightings, of, mermen, are, less, common, than, those, of, mermaids, they, are, in, folklore, generally, assumed, to, co, exist, with, their, female, counterparts, the, male, and, the, female, collectively, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, merfolk, or, merpeople, the, western, concept, of, mermaids, as, beautiful, seductive, singers, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, sirens, of, greek, mythology, which, were, originally, half, birdlike, but, came, to, be, pictured, as, half, fishlike, in, the, christian, era, historical, accounts, of, mermaids, such, as, those, reported, by, christopher, columbus, during, his, exploration, of, the, caribbean, may, have, been, sightings, of, manatees, or, similar, aquatic, mammals, while, there, is, no, evidence, that, mermaids, exist, outside, folklore, reports, of, mermaid, sightings, continue, to, the, present, day, mermaids, have, been, a, popular, subject, of, art, and, literature, in, recent, centuries, such, as, in, hans, christian, andersen, s, literary, fairy, tale, the, little, mermaid, 1837, they, have, subsequently, been, depicted, in, operas, paintings, books, comics, animation, and, live, action, films, the, english, word, mermaid, has, its, earliest, known, attestation, in, middle, english, chaucer, nun, s, priest, s, tale, c, 1390, the, compound, word, is, formed, from, mere, sea, and, maid, another, english, word, mermin, headword, in, the, oed, for, siren, or, mermaid, is, older, though, now, obsolete, it, derives, from, old, english, m, rem, nen, ad, m, re, sea, m, nen, female, slave, earliest, attestation, mereminne, as, a, gloss, for, siren, in, corpus, glossary, c, 725, a, middle, english, example, mereman, in, a, bestiary, c, 1220, manuscript, now, dated, to, 1275, 1300, is, indeed, a, mermaid, part, maiden, part, fish, like, its, old, high, german, cognate, merimenni, is, known, from, biblical, glosses, and, physiologus, the, middle, high, german, cognate, merminne, mod, german, meerweib, mermaid, is, attested, in, epics, and, the, one, in, rabenschlacht, is, a, great, grandmother, this, same, figure, is, in, an, old, swedish, text, a, haffru, and, in, old, norse, a, sj, kona, si, kona, sea, woman, old, norse, marmennill, dill, masculine, noun, is, also, listed, as, cognate, to, mermin, as, well, as, on, margmelli, modern, icelandic, marbendill, and, modern, norwegian, marm, le, old, english, m, rewif, is, another, related, term, and, appears, once, in, reference, not, so, much, to, a, mermaid, but, a, certain, sea, hag, and, not, well, attested, later, its, mhg, cognate, merw, p, also, defined, as, meerweib, in, modern, german, with, perhaps, merwoman, a, valid, english, definition, the, word, is, attested, among, other, medieval, epics, in, the, nibelungenlied, and, rendered, merwoman, mermaid, water, sprite, or, other, terms, the, two, in, the, story, are, translated, as, on, sj, konur, sea, women, the, siren, of, ancient, greek, mythology, became, conflated, with, mermaids, during, the, medieval, period, some, european, romance, languages, still, use, cognate, terms, for, siren, to, denote, the, mermaid, e, g, french, sir, ne, and, spanish, and, italian, sirena, some, commentators, have, sought, to, trace, origins, further, back, into, ancient, middle, eastern, mythology, in, the, early, greek, period, the, sirens, were, conceived, of, as, human, headed, birds, but, by, the, classical, period, the, greeks, sporadically, depicted, the, siren, as, part, fish, in, art, the, siren, s, part, fish, appearance, became, increasingly, popular, during, the, middle, ages, the, traits, of, the, classical, sirens, such, as, using, their, beautiful, song, as, a, lure, as, told, by, homer, have, often, been, transferred, to, mermaids, these, change, of, the, medieval, siren, from, bird, to, fish, were, thought, by, some, to, be, the, influence, of, teutonic, myth, later, expounded, in, literary, legends, of, lorelei, and, undine, though, a, dissenting, comment, is, that, parallels, are, not, limited, to, teutonic, culture, the, earliest, text, describing, the, siren, as, fish, tailed, occurs, in, the, liber, monstrorum, de, diversis, generibus, seventh, to, mid, eighth, century, which, described, sirens, as, sea, girls, marinae, pullae, whose, beauty, in, form, and, sweet, song, allure, seafarers, but, beneath, the, human, head, and, torso, have, the, scaly, tail, end, of, a, fish, with, which, they, can, navigate, the, sea, sirens, are, mermaids, old, high, german, early, middle, high, german, sir, ne, s, nt, m, remanniu, is, explicit, in, the, aforementioned, old, german, physiologus, eleventh, century, the, middle, english, bestiary, mid, 13th, century, clearly, means, mermaid, when, it, explains, the, siren, to, be, a, mereman, stating, that, she, has, a, body, and, breast, like, that, of, a, maiden, but, joined, at, the, navel, by, a, body, part, which, is, definitely, fish, with, fins, growing, out, of, her, old, french, verse, bestiaries, e, g, philipp, de, thaun, s, version, written, c, 1121, 1139, also, accommodated, by, stating, that, a, part, of, the, siren, may, be, bird, or, fish, in, a, ninth, century, physiologus, manufactured, in, france, fig, top, left, the, siren, was, illustrated, as, a, woman, fish, i, e, mermaid, like, despite, being, described, as, bird, like, in, the, text, the, bodleian, bestiary, dated, 1220, 12, also, pictures, a, group, of, fish, tailed, mermaid, like, sirens, fig, bottom, contradicting, its, text, which, likens, it, to, a, winged, fowl, volatilis, habet, figuram, down, to, their, feet, in, the, interim, the, siren, as, pure, mermaid, was, becoming, commonplace, particularly, in, the, so, called, second, family, latin, bestiaries, as, represented, in, one, of, the, early, manuscripts, classified, into, this, group, additional, manuscript, 11283, c, 1170, 1180s, fig, top, right, while, the, siren, holding, a, fish, was, a, commonplace, theme, the, siren, in, bestiaries, were, also, sometimes, depicted, holding, the, comb, or, the, mirror, the, comb, and, mirror, became, a, persistent, symbol, of, the, siren, mermaid, in, the, christian, moralizing, context, e, g, the, bestiaries, the, mermaid, s, mirror, and, comb, were, held, as, the, symbol, of, vanity, the, sea, monsters, scylla, and, charybdis, who, lived, near, the, sirens, were, also, female, and, had, some, fishlike, attributes, though, scylla, s, violence, is, contrasted, with, the, sirens, seductive, ways, by, certain, classical, writers, scylla, and, charybdis, lived, near, the, sirens, domain, in, etruscan, art, before, the, sixth, century, bc, scylla, was, portrayed, as, a, mermaid, like, creature, with, two, tails, this, may, be, tied, to, images, of, two, tailed, mermaids, ranging, from, ancient, times, to, modern, depictions, and, is, sometimes, attached, to, the, later, character, of, melusine, a, sporadic, example, of, sirens, as, mermaids, tritonesses, in, early, greek, art, third, century, bc, can, be, explained, as, the, contamination, of, the, siren, myth, with, scylla, and, charybdis, the, female, oceanids, nereids, and, naiads, are, mythical, water, nymphs, or, deities, although, not, depicted, with, fish, tails, nereid, and, nymph, have, also, been, applied, to, actual, mermaid, like, marine, creatures, purported, to, exist, from, pliny, cf, roman, lusitania, and, gaul, and, onwards, jane, ellen, harrison, 1882, has, speculated, that, the, mermaids, or, tritonesses, of, greek, and, roman, mythology, may, have, been, brought, from, the, middle, east, possibly, transmitted, by, phoenician, mariners, the, greek, god, triton, had, two, fish, tails, instead, of, legs, and, later, became, pluralized, as, a, group, the, prophetic, sea, deity, glaucus, was, also, depicted, with, a, fish, tail, and, sometimes, with, fins, for, arms, depictions, of, entities, with, the, upper, bodies, of, humans, and, the, tails, of, fish, appear, in, mesopotamian, artwork, from, the, old, babylonian, period, onwards, on, cylinder, seals, these, figures, are, usually, mermen, kulull, but, mermaids, do, occasionally, appear, the, name, for, the, mermaid, figure, may, have, been, kuliltu, meaning, fish, woman, such, figures, were, used, in, neo, assyrian, art, as, protective, figures, and, were, shown, in, both, monumental, sculpture, and, in, small, protective, figurines, a, mermaid, like, goddess, identified, by, greek, and, roman, writers, as, derceto, or, atargatis, was, worshipped, at, ashkelon, in, a, myth, recounted, by, diodorus, siculus, in, the, first, century, bc, derceto, gave, birth, to, a, child, from, an, affair, ashamed, she, abandoned, the, child, in, the, desert, and, drowned, herself, in, a, lake, only, to, be, transformed, into, a, human, headed, fish, the, child, semiramis, was, fed, by, doves, and, survived, to, become, a, queen, in, the, second, century, lucian, described, seeing, a, phoenician, statue, of, derceto, with, the, upper, body, of, a, woman, and, the, tail, of, a, fish, he, noted, the, contrast, with, the, grand, statue, located, at, her, holy, city, hierapolis, bambyce, which, appeared, entirely, human, in, the, myth, semiramis, s, first, husband, is, named, onnes, some, scholars, have, compared, this, to, the, earlier, mesopotamian, myth, of, oannes, one, of, the, apkallu, or, seven, sages, described, as, fish, men, in, cuneiform, texts, while, oannes, was, a, servant, of, the, water, deity, ea, having, gained, wisdom, from, the, god, english, writer, arthur, waugh, understood, oannes, to, be, equivalent, to, ea, and, proposed, that, surely, oannes, had, a, fish, tailed, wife, and, descendants, with, atargatis, being, one, deity, thus, descended, through, the, mists, of, time, diodorus, s, chronology, of, queen, semiramis, resembles, the, feats, of, alexander, the, great, campaigns, to, india, etc, and, diodorus, may, have, woven, the, macedonian, king, s, material, via, some, unnamed, source, there, is, a, mermaid, legend, attached, to, alexander, the, great, s, sister, but, this, is, of, post, medieval, vintage, see, below, sometime, before, 546, bc, milesian, philosopher, anaximander, postulated, that, mankind, had, sprung, from, an, aquatic, animal, species, a, theory, that, is, sometimes, called, the, aquatic, ape, theory, he, thought, that, humans, who, begin, life, with, prolonged, infancy, could, not, have, survived, otherwise, there, are, also, naturalist, theories, on, the, origins, of, the, mermaid, postulating, they, derive, from, sightings, of, manatees, dugongs, or, even, seals, still, another, theory, tangentially, related, to, the, aforementioned, aquatic, ape, theory, is, that, the, mermaids, of, folklore, were, actually, human, women, who, trained, over, time, to, be, skilled, divers, for, things, like, sponges, and, spent, a, lot, of, time, in, the, sea, as, a, result, one, proponent, of, this, theory, is, british, author, william, bond, who, has, written, several, books, about, it, two, prophetic, merwomen, mhg, pl, merw, p, sigelinde, mhg, sigelint, and, her, maternal, aunt, hadeburg, mhg, hadeburc, are, bathing, in, the, danube, river, when, hagen, von, tronje, encounters, them, nibelungenlied, ventiure, 25, they, are, called, sj, konar, sea, women, in, the, old, norse, i, reks, saga, there, is, a, swan, maiden, tale, motif, involved, here, hagen, robs, their, clothing, but, grimm, argued, they, must, have, actually, been, swan, maidens, since, they, are, described, as, hovering, above, water, in, any, case, this, brief, segment, became, the, foundational, groundwork, of, subsequent, water, nix, lore, and, literature, that, developed, in, the, germanic, sphere, they, are, a, probable, source, of, the, three, rhine, maidens, in, richard, wagner, s, opera, das, rheingold, though, conceived, of, as, swan, maidens, in, wagner, s, 1848, scenario, the, number, being, a, threesome, was, suggested, by, the, woodcut, by, julius, schnorr, von, carolsfeld, and, eugen, napoleon, neureuther, in, the, pfizer, edition, of, 1843, fig, on, the, left, middle, high, german, mereminne, mermaid, is, mentioned, among, other, epics, in, the, rabenschlacht, battle, of, ravenna, 13th, cent, of, the, dietrich, cycle, the, mermaid, or, undine, is, named, w, chilt, and, is, the, ancestress, of, the, traitorous, wittich, who, carries, him, off, at, the, time, of, peril, to, her, submarine, home, this, material, has, been, found, translated, as, a, medieval, i, reks, saga, only, in, a, late, reworked, swedish, version, i, e, one, of, the, closing, chapters, of, i, riks, saga, fifteenth, century, also, known, as, the, swedish, epilogue, the, mermaid, undine, is, here, translated, as, old, swedish, haffru, the, old, norse, i, reks, saga, proper, calls, the, same, mermaid, a, sj, kona, si, kona, or, sea, woman, the, genealogy, is, given, in, the, saga, the, sea, woman, and, villcinus, vilkinus, king, of, scandinavia, together, had, a, son, va, i, wade, of, sj, land, sj, lland, zealand, who, was, a, giant, risi, whose, son, was, velent, wayland, the, smith, whose, son, after, that, was, vi, ga, velentsson, wittich, or, witige, who, became, a, companion, champion, of, king, i, rekr, dietrich, von, bern, thus, the, saga, is, an, early, source, which, associates, a, famed, clan, of, merfolk, with, a, place, in, denmark, i, e, sj, lland, sj, lland, was, the, divided, portion, of, villcina, land, inherited, by, the, bastard, prince, va, i, wade, according, to, the, saga, the, swedish, epilogue, transposed, the, locations, concerning, the, battle, from, italy, to, germany, and, claimed, the, rescued, vi, ga, witige, was, brought, to, sj, lland, that, is, to, say, the, crucial, battle, had, been, in, ravenna, northern, italy, in, the, german, epic, rabenschlacht, but, the, battle, spot, was, changed, to, gronsport, somewhere, on, the, moselle, in, northern, germany, in, the, swedish, version, the, norman, chapel, in, durham, castle, built, around, 1078, has, what, is, probably, the, earliest, surviving, artistic, depiction, of, a, mermaid, in, england, it, can, be, seen, on, a, south, facing, capital, above, one, of, the, original, norman, stone, pillars, mermaids, appear, in, british, folklore, as, unlucky, omens, both, foretelling, disaster, and, provoking, it, several, variants, of, the, ballad, sir, patrick, spens, depict, a, mermaid, speaking, to, the, doomed, ships, in, some, versions, she, tells, them, they, will, never, see, land, again, in, others, she, claims, they, are, near, shore, which, they, are, wise, enough, to, know, means, the, same, thing, mermaids, can, also, be, a, sign, of, approaching, rough, weather, and, some, have, been, described, as, monstrous, in, size, up, to, 2, 000, feet, 610, m, in, another, short, ballad, clerk, colvill, child, ballad, no, 42, the, mermaid, seduces, the, title, character, and, foretells, his, doom, it, has, been, surmised, that, in, the, original, complete, version, the, man, was, being, penalized, for, spurning, her, though, the, scandinavian, counterparts, that, tells, the, complete, story, feature, an, elf, woman, or, elf, queen, rather, than, mermaid, mermaids, have, been, described, as, able, to, swim, up, rivers, to, freshwater, lakes, in, one, story, the, laird, of, lorntie, went, to, aid, a, woman, he, thought, was, drowning, in, a, lake, near, his, house, his, servant, pulled, him, back, warning, that, it, was, a, mermaid, and, the, mermaid, screamed, at, them, that, she, would, have, killed, him, if, it, were, not, for, his, servant, but, mermaids, could, occasionally, be, more, beneficent, e, g, teaching, humans, cures, for, certain, diseases, mermen, have, been, described, as, wilder, and, uglier, than, mermaids, with, little, interest, in, humans, according, to, legend, a, mermaid, came, to, the, cornish, village, of, zennor, where, she, used, to, listen, to, the, singing, of, a, chorister, matthew, trewhella, the, two, fell, in, love, and, matthew, went, with, the, mermaid, to, her, home, at, pendour, cove, on, summer, nights, the, lovers, can, be, heard, singing, together, the, legend, recorded, by, folklorist, william, bottrell, stems, from, a, fifteenth, century, mermaid, carving, on, a, wooden, bench, at, the, church, of, saint, senara, in, zennor, some, tales, raised, the, question, of, whether, mermaids, had, immortal, souls, answering, in, the, negative, in, scottish, mythology, a, ceasg, is, a, freshwater, mermaid, though, little, beside, the, term, has, been, preserved, in, folklore, mermaids, from, the, isle, of, man, known, as, ben, varrey, are, considered, more, favorable, toward, humans, than, those, of, other, regions, with, various, accounts, of, assistance, gifts, and, rewards, one, story, tells, of, a, fisherman, who, carried, a, stranded, mermaid, back, into, the, sea, and, was, rewarded, with, the, location, of, treasure, another, recounts, the, tale, of, a, baby, mermaid, who, stole, a, doll, from, a, human, little, girl, but, was, rebuked, by, her, mother, and, sent, back, to, the, girl, with, a, gift, of, a, pearl, necklace, to, atone, for, the, theft, a, third, story, tells, of, a, fishing, family, that, made, regular, gifts, of, apples, to, a, mermaid, and, was, rewarded, with, prosperity, in, irish, lore, l, ban, was, a, human, being, transformed, into, a, mermaid, after, three, centuries, when, christianity, came, to, ireland, she, was, baptized, the, irish, mermaid, is, called, merrow, in, tales, such, as, lady, of, gollerus, published, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, mermaid, corresponds, to, danish, and, bokm, l, norwegian, havfrue, whereas, merman, answers, to, danish, norwegian, havmand, as, a, side, note, a, supposed, old, norse, haffr, is, the, etymological, source, of, norman, french, havette, for, a, man, snatching, water, sprite, according, to, one, linguist, an, early, description, of, the, havfrue, and, her, mate, havmand, was, given, by, the, danish, bishop, pontoppidan, 1753, they, were, considered, the, mating, female, and, male, of, the, creature, inhabiting, the, north, sea, and, their, offspring, was, called, marm, le, var, marm, te, as, repeated, by, later, commentators, though, he, was, aware, of, fabulous, fables, being, told, about, them, he, was, convinced, such, creature, existed, but, as, they, were, non, human, he, argued, the, term, havmand, merman, should, be, avoided, in, favor, of, some, coined, term, such, as, sea, ape, danish, hav, abe, he, also, knowingly, employed, old, norwegian, old, norse, maryge, and, hafstrambe, as, the, norwegian, names, of, the, mermaid, and, merman, respectively, the, icelandic, cognate, form, is, haffr, with, several, synonyms, though, instead, of, these, the, commonly, used, term, today, is, hafmey, the, faroese, forms, are, havfr, gv, havfr, g, the, swedish, form, is, hafsfru, with, other, synonyms, such, as, sj, jungfru, or, sj, r, sea, fairy, the, maritime, counterpart, of, the, forest, skogsr, the, terms, marg, gur, or, havg, gur, as, aliases, for, mermaid, were, apparently, current, among, the, populace, in, modern, age, iceland, according, to, j, n, rnason, alongside, the, marbendill, modern, icelandic, for, on, marmennill, benjamin, thorpe, 1851, writing, on, norwegian, folklore, gave, margygr, for, mermaid, and, marmennill, for, merman, as, norwegian, folk, terms, but, these, are, interpolations, which, the, source, andreas, faye, s, norske, sagn, 1833, only, side, noted, as, occurrences, of, old, terms, in, medieval, literature, the, beautiful, havfrue, of, scandinavia, may, be, benevolent, or, malicious, and, legends, about, her, abducting, maidens, cf, infra, is, given, as, a, case, of, point, for, her, malice, it, is, said, the, havfrue, will, avenge, harm, done, to, it, as, in, the, norwegian, anecdote, of, one, who, was, lured, near, the, ship, and, had, her, hand, cruelly, lopped, off, on, the, gunwale, she, caused, a, storm, that, nearly, drowned, the, wicked, sailor, the, appearance, sighting, alone, betides, an,

swedish, tradition, much, as, the, appearance, of, the, skogsr, wood, nymph, presages, poor, catch, for, the, hunter, according, to, the, superstitions, of, swedish, fishermen, if, one, saw, a, sj, r, who, was, harbinger, of, tempest, and, bad, catch, one, should, not, tell, his, comrades, but, strike, flint, against, steel, to, light, a, spark, in, other, cases, the, scandinavian, mermaid, is, considered, to, be, prophetic, the, tale, type, the, mermaid, s, message, norwegian, havfruas, sp, dom, ml, 4060, is, recognized, as, a, migratory, legend, i, e, a, group, of, tales, found, in, scandinavia, with, parallels, found, elsewhere, according, to, the, scheme, devised, by, reidar, thoralf, christiansen, this, may, not, necessarily, involve, the, mermaid, s, spaeing, and, in, the, following, example, of, this, ml, type, tale, she, merely, imparts, wisdom, a, fisherman, who, performs, favors, and, earns, the, privilege, to, pose, three, questions, to, a, mermaid, he, inquires, about, the, most, suitable, material, for, a, flail, to, which, she, answers, calf, s, hide, of, course, and, tells, him, he, should, have, asked, about, how, to, brew, water, into, beer, which, would, have, benefited, him, more, greatly, the, swedish, ballad, hafsfrun, havsfruns, t, rna, smb, 23, tsb, a, 51, is, an, instance, where, a, mermaid, kidnaps, a, human, girl, at, age, fifteen, and, when, the, girl, s, brother, accomplishes, the, rescue, the, mermaid, declares, she, would, have, cracked, her, neck, if, she, knew, she, would, be, thus, betrayed, the, swedish, merman, hafsman, steals, a, human, woman, to, become, his, bride, according, to, folklore, as, aforementioned, the, mermaid, norwegian, havfrue, takes, the, merman, norwegian, havmand, for, husband, and, produce, children, called, marm, ler, sing, norwegian, marm, le, sea, talkers, which, the, fishermen, sometimes, bring, home, to, gain, insight, into, the, future, early, sources, say, that, norwegian, fishermen, who, capture, the, marm, te, or, marm, le, may, bring, them, home, but, do, not, dare, keep, it, for, more, than, 24, hours, before, turning, them, back, into, the, sea, whence, they, found, it, j, n, rnason, describes, the, marg, gur, as, yellow, haired, woman, who, is, fish, from, the, waist, down, who, drags, careless, seamen, to, the, depths, of, the, sea, however, margygr, literally, means, something, like, mer, troll, and, in, medieval, tradition, the, margygr, is, more, of, a, sea, monster, or, sea, ogress, according, to, a, version, of, the, saga, of, st, olaf, olaf, ii, of, norway, the, king, encountered, a, margygr, whose, singing, lulled, voyagers, to, sleep, causing, them, to, drown, and, whose, high, pitched, shrieks, drove, men, insane, her, physical, appearance, is, described, thus, she, has, a, head, like, a, horse, with, ears, erect, and, distended, nostrils, big, green, eyes, and, fearful, jaws, she, has, shoulders, like, a, horse, and, hands, in, front, but, behind, she, resembles, a, serpent, this, margygr, was, also, said, to, be, furry, like, a, seal, and, gray, colored, melusine, is, a, mermaid, like, character, from, european,

attested, until, after, the, mid, nineteenth, century, to, the, best, knowledge, of, camara, cascudo, cascudo, in, his, earlier, writing, contended, that, though, the, iara, was, rooted, in, two, indigenous, beings, the, water, devil, ipupiara, cf, below, and, the, cobra, grande, he, also, saw, the, combining, of, the, portuguese, lore, of, the, enchanted, moura, moorish, girl, who, was, obviously, dark, skinned, the, iara, became, increasingly, to, be, regarded, as, a, woman, fish, after, the, image, of, the, european, sirens, mermaids, it, is, often, argued, that, the, legends, of, the, iara, developed, around, the, eighteenth, century, out, of, the, indigenous, myth, of, the, ipupiara, among, the, tupinamb, people, the, ipupiara, was, originally, conceived, of, as, a, male, water, dweller, that, carried, fishermen, to, the, bottom, devouring, their, mouths, nose, fingertips, and, genitals, european, writers, during, the, age, of, exploration, disseminated, the, myth, but, the, gandavo, 1576, included, an, illustration, of, hipupi, ra, with, female, breasts, subsequently, the, jesuit, cardim, wrote, that, the, igpupi, ra, also, consisted, of, females, that, look, like, women, with, long, hair, though, somewhat, vague, in, the, case, of, gandavo, cardim, had, clearly, injected, christian, opinion, which, would, readily, relegate, the, role, of, emasculating, men, to, the, female, kind, later, with, the, introduction, of, african, slaves, the, yoruba, myth, of, iemanj, was, admixed, into, the, telling, in, his, natural, history, 9, 4, 9, 11, pliny, the, elder, remarked, that, a, triton, merman, was, seen, off, the, coast, of, olisipo, present, day, lisbon, portugal, and, it, bore, the, physical, appearance, in, accordance, with, common, notion, of, the, triton, according, to, a, deputation, from, lisbon, who, reported, it, to, emperor, tiberus, one, nereid, was, sighted, earlier, on, the, same, lisbon, coast, pliny, remarks, that, contrary, to, popular, notion, the, true, nereids, are, not, smooth, skinned, in, their, human, like, portions, but, covered, with, scales, all, over, the, body, their, mournful, songs, at, death, have, also, been, heard, by, the, coastal, inhabitants, also, multiple, nereids, had, washed, up, on, the, shore, according, to, the, legatus, governor, of, gaul, who, informed, the, late, emperor, augustus, about, it, in, a, letter, sixteenth, century, swedish, writer, olaus, magnus, quotes, the, same, passage, from, pliny, and, further, notes, that, the, nereid, are, said, to, utter, dismal, moans, wailings, at, the, hour, of, her, death, thus, observing, a, connection, to, the, legend, of, sea, nymphs, and, the, sister, fates, whose, clashing, cymbals, and, flute, tunes, could, be, heard, on, shore, olaus, in, a, later, passage, states, that, the, nereids, tr, mermaids, are, known, to, sing, plaintively, in, general, it, has, been, conjectured, that, these, carcasses, of, nereids, washed, up, on, shore, were, presumably, seals, in, 1493, sailing, off, the, coast, of, hispaniola, christopher, columbus, spotted, three, mermaids, spanish, sirenas, which, he, said, were, not, as, beautiful, as, they, are, represented, due, to, masculine, features, in, their, faces, he, is, widely, believed, to, have, seen, manatees, not, mermaids, during, henry, hudson, s, second, voyage, on, 15, june, 1608, members, of, his, crew, reported, sighting, a, mermaid, in, the, arctic, ocean, either, in, the, norwegian, or, barents, seas, dutch, explorer, david, danell, during, his, expeditions, to, greenland, in, 1652, 54, claimed, to, have, spotted, a, mermaid, with, flowing, hair, and, very, beautiful, though, the, crew, failed, to, capture, it, danish, physician, and, natural, historian, thomas, bartholin, wrote, about, a, mermaid, specimen, caught, in, brazil, probably, a, manatee, and, subsequently, dissected, at, leiden, though, referred, to, in, the, text, as, a, sea, man, homo, marinus, from, brazil, the, account, was, accompanied, by, an, engraved, drawing, captioned, sirene, whose, appearance, was, that, of, a, humanoid, female, with, bared, breasts, a, mermaid, the, specimen, s, body, was, deformed, and, without, the, sign, of, a, tail, matching, the, drawing, and, a, membrane, join, together, is, also, reflected, in, the, drawing, as, well, as, her, webbed, pair, of, hands, forepaws, the, specimen, s, account, and, illustration, was, later, reproduced, by, linnaeus, who, captioned, the, beast, siren, bartholini, hence, bartholin, s, siren, bartholin, was, actually, not, the, sole, proprietor, of, the, specimen, but, he, came, into, possession, of, its, hand, and, ribs, which, he, also, illustrated, in, his, book, figures, above, based, on, the, illustration, the, hand, has, been, determined, to, be, the, front, flipper, belonging, to, a, manatee, by, a, team, of, researchers, bartholin, himself, had, argued, that, it, was, a, sea, mammal, closely, related, to, seals, phocae, his, rationale, was, that, since, there, are, several, marine, counterparts, to, land, mammals, e, g, sea, horses, the, possibility, of, a, marine, creature, with, striking, likeness, to, humans, could, not, be, ruled, out, though, they, should, all, be, classified, among, seal, kind, erasmus, francisci, erasmus, finx, 1668, associated, this, brazilian, specimen, with, the, local, native, lore, of, the, yupiapra, ipupiara, a, type, of, mermaid, referred, to, as, anthropomorphus, or, woman, fish, spanish, peche, mujer, allegedly, inhabited, the, spanish, ruled, philippines, particularly, in, the, waters, around, the, visayan, islands, according, to, contemporary, writings, from, the, seventeenth, century, the, accounts, are, found, in, several, books, on, various, topics, from, magnetism, to, natural, history, to, ecclesiastical, history, these, books, refer, to, the, mermaid, merman, as, piscis, anthropomorphos, dutch, anthropomorphus, and, emphasize, how, human, like, they, appear, in, their, upper, bodies, as, well, as, providing, woodcut, or, etchings, illustrating, the, male, and, female, of, the, part, human, part, fish, creature, the, woman, fish, or, peche, mujer, in, modern, spanish, was, the, name, given, to, the, creature, among, the, spaniards, but, the, sources, also, state, it, was, called, duyon, by, the, indigenous, people, and, it, is, assumed, the, actual, creature, was, a, dugong, according, to, modern, translators, notes, several, of, these, sources, mention, the, medical, use, of, the, woman, fish, to, control, the, flow, of, blood, or, the, four, humours, it, was, effective, for, staunching, the, bleeding, i, e, effective, against, hemorrhages, according, to, jonston, other, sources, mention, the, ability, to, stop, bleeding, e, g, col, n, who, also, thought, that, the, philippine, woman, fish, tasted, like, fatty, pork, the, bones, were, made, into, beads, i, e, strung, together, as, it, was, believed, effective, against, defluxions, of, the, humours, allegedly, captured, in, the, moluccas, in, the, seventeenth, century, was, the, so, called, amboina, mermaid, after, the, then, dutch, province, of, ambon, which, its, leading, researcher, has, referred, to, as, samuel, fallours, s, sirenne, after, the, man, who, came, into, possession, of, it, and, made, an, original, painting, of, it, in, full, color, the, painting, was, reproduced, by, louis, renard, on, the, fish, of, the, region, first, published, in, 1719, it, was, supposedly, caught, by, boeren, in, ambon, province, buru, in, present, day, maluku, province, presumably, around, the, years, 1706, 1712, or, perhaps, the, year, 1712, precisely, during, this, period, fallours, served, briefly, as, soldier, for, the, voc, dutch, east, india, company, starting, june, 1706, but, turned, associate, curate, krankbezoeker, for, the, dutch, reformed, church, september, 1706, to, june, 1712, fallour, s, mermaid, with, additional, details, were, described, by, fran, ois, valentijn, in, a, 1726, book, the, mermaid, was, 59, dutch, inches, duimen, long, or, 5, feet, in, rhineland, measures, she, reportedly, survived, 4, days, 7, hours, in, a, water, tank, and, died, after, refusing, food, it, was, given, having, uttered, no, intelligible, sound, or, issuing, sounds, like, screechings, of, a, mouse, french, souris, something, like, a, straw, cape, japanese, mino, appears, wrapped, around, her, waist, in, the, painting, according, to, one, commentator, but, fallours, revealed, in, his, notes, that, he, lifted, the, front, and, back, fins, and, it, was, shaped, like, a, woman, the, mermaid, was, suspected, to, be, a, dugong, in, reality, even, by, contemporary, scholars, such, as, georg, rumphius, although, valentijn, was, unable, to, believe, they, were, the, one, and, the, same, leading, researcher, theodore, w, pietsch, concurs, with, the, dugong, identification, but, an, ichthyologist, has, opined, that, i, could, more, easily, accept, a, small, oar, fish, or, another, eel, like, fish, rather, than, a, dugong, as, a, partial, basis, for, the, drawing, noting, that, renard, s, book, carries, an, illustration, of, a, plausibly, realistic, dugong, as, well, the, yuezhong, jianwen, chinese, wade, giles, yueh, chung, chieh, wen, seens, and, heards, or, jottings, on, the, south, of, china, 1730, contains, two,

these, differences, lie, both, a, sense, of, strangeness, on, earth, and, the, possible, key, to, a, way, of, feeling, at, home, here, the, best, known, example, of, mermaids, in, literature, is,
