ezra, fl, 480, 440, bce, was, an, important, jewish, scribe, sofer, and, priest, kohen, in, the, early, second, temple, period, in, the, greek, septuagint, the, name, is, rendered, as, sdr, s, from, which, the, latin, name, esdras, comes, his, name, is, probably, a, shortened, aramaic, translation, of, the, hebrew, name, azaryahu, meaning, yah, helps, in, the, hebrew, bible, or, the, christian, old, testament, ezra, is, an, important, figure, in, the, books, of, ezra, and, nehemiah, which, he, is, said, to, have, written, and, edited, respectively, according, to, tradition, ezra, was, also, the, author, of, the, books, of, chronicles, and, the, book, of, malachi, ezra, was, instrumental, in, restoring, the, jewish, scriptures, and, religion, to, the, people, after, the, return, from, the, babylonian, captivity, and, is, a, highly, respected, figure, in, judaism, he, is, regarded, as, a, saint, in, the, roman, catholic, church, which, sets, his, feast, day, as, july, 13, the, same, as, that, of, his, contemporary, nehemiah, he, is, also, venerated, as, a, saint, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, which, sets, his, feast, day, on, the, sunday, of, the, holy, forefathers, the, canonical, book, of, ezra, and, book, of, nehemiah, are, the, oldest, sources, for, the, activity, of, ezra, whereas, many, of, the, other, books, ascribed, to, ezra, first, esdras, 3, 6, ezra, are, later, literary, works, dependent, on, the, canonical, books, of, ezra, and, nehemiah, the, book, of, ezra, nehemiah, was, always, written, as, one, scroll, in, late, medieval, christian, bibles, the, single, book, was, divided, in, two, as, first, and, second, ezra, and, this, division, became, jewish, practice, in, the, first, printed, hebrew, bibles, modern, hebrew, bibles, call, the, two, books, ezra, and, nehemiah, as, do, other, modern, bible, translations, a, few, parts, of, the, book, of, ezra, 4, 8, to, 6, 18, and, 7, 12, 26, were, written, in, aramaic, and, the, majority, in, hebrew, ezra, himself, being, skilled, in, both, languages, according, to, the, hebrew, bible, he, was, a, descendant, of, seraiah, the, last, high, priest, to, serve, in, solomon, s, temple, and, a, close, relative, of, joshua, the, first, high, priest, of, the, second, temple, he, returned, from, babylonian, captivity, and, reintroduced, the, torah, in, jerusalem, according, to, 1, esdras, a, greek, translation, of, the, book, of, ezra, still, in, use, in, eastern, orthodox, church, he, was, also, a, high, priest, rabbinic, tradition, supports, the, positions, that, ezra, was, an, ordinary, member, of, the, priesthood, and, that, he, actually, served, as, a, kohen, gadol, ezra, was, living, in, babylon, when, in, the, seventh, year, of, artaxerxes, i, the, achaemenid, emperor, c, 457, bce, the, emperor, sent, him, to, jerusalem, to, teach, the, laws, of, god, to, any, who, did, not, know, them, the, book, of, ezra, describes, how, he, led, a, group, of, judean, exiles, living, in, babylon, to, their, home, city, of, jerusalem, where, he, is, said, to, have, enforced, observance, of, the, torah, when, ezra, discovered, that, jewish, men, had, been, marrying, foreign, pagan, women, he, tore, his, garments, in, despair, and, confessed, the, sins, of, israel, before, god, then, braved, the, opposition, of, some, of, his, countrymen, to, purify, the, community, by, enforcing, the, dissolution, of, the, sinful, marriages, he, was, described, as, exhorting, the, israelite, people, to, be, sure, to, follow, the, torah, law, so, as, not, to, intermarry, with, people, of, foreign, blood, a, set, of, commandments, described, in, the, torah, some, years, later, artaxerxes, sent, nehemiah, a, jewish, noble, in, his, service, as, governor, in, jerusalem, with, the, task, of, rebuilding, the, city, walls, once, this, task, was, completed, nehemiah, had, ezra, read, the, torah, to, the, assembled, israelites, and, the, people, and, priests, entered, into, a, covenant, to, keep, the, law, and, separate, themselves, from, all, other, peoples, several, traditions, have, developed, over, his, place, of, burial, one, tradition, says, that, he, is, buried, in, ezra, s, tomb, near, basra, iraq, while, another, tradition, alleges, that, he, is, buried, in, tadef, near, aleppo, in, northern, syria, according, to, josephus, ezra, died, and, was, buried, in, a, magnificent, manner, in, jerusalem, if, the, tradition, that, ezra, wrote, under, the, pen, name, malachi, is, correct, then, he, was, probably, buried, in, the, tomb, of, the, prophets, the, traditional, resting, place, of, malachi, along, with, two, other, prophets, from, ezra, s, lifetime, haggai, and, zechariah, 1, esdras, probably, from, the, late, 2nd, early, 1st, centuries, bce, preserves, a, greek, text, of, ezra, and, a, part, of, nehemiah, distinctly, different, from, that, of, ezra, nehemiah, in, particular, it, eliminates, nehemiah, from, the, story, and, gives, some, of, his, deeds, to, ezra, as, well, as, telling, events, in, a, different, order, scholars, are, divided, on, whether, it, is, based, on, ezra, nehemiah, or, reflects, an, earlier, literary, stage, before, the, combination, of, ezra, and, nehemiah, accounts, the, first, century, jewish, historian, josephus, deals, with, ezra, in, his, antiquities, of, the, jews, he, uses, the, name, xerxes, for, artaxerxes, i, reserving, the, name, artaxerxes, for, the, later, artaxerxes, ii, whom, he, identifies, as, the, ahasuerus, of, esther, thus, placing, ezra, before, the, events, of, the, book, of, esther, josephus, account, of, the, deeds, of, ezra, derives, entirely, from, 1, esdras, which, he, cites, as, the, book, of, ezra, in, his, numeration, of, the, hebrew, bible, contrariwise, josephus, does, not, appear, to, recognise, ezra, nehemiah, as, a, biblical, book, does, not, quote, from, it, and, relies, entirely, on, other, traditions, in, his, account, of, the, deeds, of, nehemiah, the, apocalyptic, fourth, book, of, ezra, also, sometimes, called, the, second, book, of, esdras, or, the, third, book, of, esdras, was, written, c, ce, 100, probably, in, judeo, aramaic, but, now, survives, in, latin, slavonic, and, ethiopic, in, this, book, ezra, has, a, seven, part, prophetic, revelation, converses, with, an, angel, of, god, three, times, and, has, four, visions, ezra, thirty, years, into, the, babylonian, exile, 4, ezra, 3, 1, 2, esdras, 1, 1, recounts, the, siege, of, jerusalem, and, the, destruction, of, solomon, s, temple, the, central, theological, themes, are, the, question, of, theodicy, god, s, justness, in, the, face, of, the, triumph, of, the, heathens, over, the, pious, the, course, of, world, history, in, terms, of, the, teaching, of, the, four, kingdoms, the, function, of, the, law, the, eschatological, judgment, the, appearance, on, earth, of, the, heavenly, jerusalem, the, messianic, period, at, the, end, of, which, the, messiah, will, die, the, end, of, this, world, and, the, coming, of, the, next, and, the, last, judgment, ezra, restores, the, law, that, was, destroyed, with, the, burning, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, he, dictates, 24, books, for, the, public, i, e, the, hebrew, bible, and, another, 70, for, the, wise, alone, 70, unnamed, revelatory, works, at, the, end, he, is, taken, up, to, heaven, like, enoch, and, elijah, ezra, is, seen, as, a, new, moses, in, this, book, there, is, also, another, work, thought, to, be, influenced, by, this, one, known, as, the, greek, apocalypse, of, ezra, traditionally, judaism, credits, ezra, with, establishing, the, great, assembly, of, scholars, and, prophets, the, forerunner, of, the, sanhedrin, as, the, authority, on, matters, of, religious, law, the, great, assembly, is, credited, with, establishing, numerous, features, of, contemporary, traditional, judaism, in, something, like, their, present, form, including, torah, reading, the, amidah, and, celebration, of, the, feast, of, purim, in, rabbinic, traditions, ezra, is, metaphorically, referred, to, as, the, flowers, that, appear, on, the, earth, signifying, the, springtime, in, the, national, history, of, judaism, a, disciple, of, baruch, ben, neriah, he, favored, study, of, the, law, over, the, reconstruction, of, the, temple, and, thus, because, of, his, studies, he, did, not, join, the, first, party, returning, to, jerusalem, in, the, reign, of, cyrus, according, to, another, opinion, he, did, not, join, the, first, party, so, as, not, to, compete, even, involuntarily, with, joshua, ben, jozadak, for, the, office, of, high, priest, of, israel, according, to, jewish, tradition, ezra, was, the, writer, of, the, books, of, chronicles, and, is, the, same, prophet, known, also, as, malachi, there, is, a, slight, controversy, within, rabbinic, sources, as, to, whether, or, not, ezra, had, served, as, high, priest, of, israel, according, to, the, babylonian, talmud, ezra, the, scribe, is, said, to, have, enacted, ten, standing, laws, and, orders, which, are, as, follows, in, the, syrian, village, of, tedef, a, synagogue, said, to, be, the, place, where, ezra, stopped, over, has, been, venerated, by, jews, for, centuries, another, tradition, locates, his, tomb, near, basra, iraq, in, christian, tradition, ezra, is, considered, to, be, the, author, of, the, book, of, ezra, and, 1, and, 2, chronicles, due, to, the, strong, similarity, between, the, books, of, malachi, and, ezra, some, christian, traditions, adopt, the, jewish, view, that, ezra, was, malachi, jerome, was, one, prominent, christian, who, held, this, view, early, christian, writers, occasionally, cited, ezra, as, author, of, the, apocalyptic, books, attributed, to, him, clement, of, alexandria, in, his, stromata, referred, to, ezra, as, an, example, of, prophetic, inspiration, quoting, a, section, from, 2, esdras, where, early, christian, writers, refer, to, the, book, of, ezra, it, is, always, the, text, of, 1, esdras, that, is, being, cited, in, islam, he, is, known, as, uzair, arabic, romanized, uzayr, he, was, mentioned, in, the, qur, an, although, he, was, not, mentioned, as, one, of, the, prophets, of, islam, he, is, considered, one, of, them, by, some, muslim, scholars, based, on, islamic, traditions, his, tomb, at, al, uzer, on, the, banks, of, the, tigris, near, basra, iraq, is, a, pilgrimage, site, for, the, local, marsh, arabs, many, islamic, scholars, and, modern, western, academics, do, not, view, uzer, as, ezra, for, example, professor, gordon, darnell, newby, associates, uzer, with, enoch, and, metatron, scholars, are, divided, over, the, chronological, sequence, of, the, activities, of, ezra, and, nehemiah, ezra, came, to, jerusalem, in, the, seventh, year, of, artaxerxes, the, king, the, text, does, not, specify, whether, the, king, in, the, passage, refers, to, artaxerxes, i, 465, 424, bce, or, to, artaxerxes, ii, 404, 359, bce, most, scholars, hold, that, ezra, lived, during, the, rule, of, artaxerxes, i, though, some, have, difficulties, with, this, assumption, nehemiah, and, ezra, seem, to, have, no, knowledge, of, each, other, their, missions, seem, to, have, no, overlap, these, difficulties, have, led, many, scholars, to, assume, that, ezra, arrived, in, the, seventh, year, of, the, rule, of, artaxerxes, ii, i, e, some, 50, years, after, nehemiah, this, assumption, would, imply, that, the, biblical, account, is, not, chronological, the, last, group, of, scholars, regard, the, seventh, year, as, a, scribal, error, and, hold, that, the, two, men, were, contemporaries, however, in, nehemiah, 8, nehemiah, has, ezra, read, the, torah, to, the, people, so, they, clearly, were, contemporaries, working, together, in, jerusalem, at, the, time, the, wall, and, the, city, of, jerusalem, was, rebuilt, in, contrast, to, the, previously, stated, viewpoint, there, is, a, much, clearer, problem, with, the, timeline, in, ezra, 4, 7, statement, that, a, letter, was, send, to, artaxerces, stopping, the, first, attempt, to, rebuild, the, temple, and, then, restarting, when, darius, became, king, clearly, that, could, not, have, happened, as, artaxerxes, only, became, king, ca, 70, years, later, so, apparently, some, events, during, the, resistance, of, leaders, of, nearby, peoples, against, the, works, of, nememia, must, have, been, confused, with, events, during, the, days, of, zerubbabel, mary, joan, winn, leith, in, the, oxford, history, of, the, biblical, world, believes, that, ezra, was, a, historical, figure, whose, life, was, enhanced, in, the, scripture, and, given, a, theological, buildup, gosta, w, ahlstrom, argues, the, inconsistencies, of, the, biblical, tradition, are, insufficient, to, say, that, ezra, with, his, central, position, as, the, father, of, judaism, in, the, jewish, tradition, has, been, a, later, literary, invention, those, who, argue, against, the, historicity, of, ezra, argue, that, the, presentation, style, of, ezra, as, a, leader, and, lawgiver, resembles, that, of, moses, there, are, also, similarities, between, ezra, the, priest, scribe, but, not, high, priest, and, nehemiah, the, secular, governor, on, the, one, hand, and, joshua, and, zerubbabel, on, the, other, hand, the, early, 2nd, century, bce, jewish, author, ben, sira, praises, nehemiah, but, makes, no, mention, of, ezra, richard, friedman, argues, in, his, book, who, wrote, the, bible, that, ezra, is, the, one, who, redacted, the, torah, and, in, fact, effectively, produced, the, first, torah, it, has, been, argued, that, even, if, one, does, not, accept, the, documentary, hypothesis, ezra, was, instrumental, in, the, start, of, the, process, of, bringing, the, torah, together, one, particular, aspect, of, ezra, s, story, considered, dubious, historically, is, the, account, in, ezra, 7, of, his, commission, according, to, it, ezra, was, given, truly, exalted, status, by, the, king, he, was, seemingly, put, in, charge, of, the, entire, western, half, of, the, persian, empire, a, position, apparently, above, even, the, level, of, the, satraps, regional, governors, ezra, was, given, vast, hoards, of, treasure, to, take, with, him, to, jerusalem, as, well, as, a, letter, where, the, king, seemingly, acknowledges, the, sovereignty, of, the, god, of, israel, yet, his, actions, in, the, story, do, not, appear, to, be, that, of, someone, with, near, unlimited, government, power, and, the, alleged, letter, from, a, persian, king, is, written, with, hebraisms, and, jewish, idiom, biblical, scholar, tova, ganzel, has, recently, argued, that, ezra, s, status, as, both, priest, and, scribe, fits, well, in, its, fifth, century, bce, historical, context, in, light, of, parallels, with, the, babylonian, temple, scribes, of, the, neo, babylonian, and, persian, periods
