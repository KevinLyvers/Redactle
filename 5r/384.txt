in, greek, mythology, the, titans, ancient, greek, hoi, t, t, nes, singular, ho, t, t, n, were, the, pre, olympian, gods, according, to, the, theogony, of, hesiod, they, were, the, twelve, children, of, the, primordial, parents, uranus, sky, and, gaia, earth, with, six, male, titans, oceanus, coeus, crius, hyperion, iapetus, and, cronus, and, six, female, titans, called, the, titanides, hai, t, t, n, des, or, titanesses, theia, rhea, themis, mnemosyne, phoebe, and, tethys, after, cronus, mated, with, his, older, sister, rhea, she, bore, the, first, generation, of, olympians, the, six, siblings, zeus, hades, poseidon, hestia, demeter, and, hera, certain, descendants, of, the, titans, such, as, prometheus, atlas, helios, and, leto, are, sometimes, also, called, titans, the, titans, were, the, former, gods, the, generation, of, gods, preceding, the, olympians, they, were, overthrown, as, part, of, the, greek, succession, myth, which, tells, how, cronus, seized, power, from, his, father, uranus, and, ruled, the, cosmos, with, his, fellow, titans, before, being, in, turn, defeated, and, replaced, as, the, ruling, pantheon, of, gods, by, zeus, and, the, olympians, in, a, ten, year, war, called, the, titanomachy, ancient, greek, romanized, h, t, t, nomakh, lit, a, battle, of, titans, as, a, result, of, this, war, the, vanquished, titans, were, banished, from, the, upper, world, and, held, imprisoned, under, guard, in, tartarus, some, titans, were, apparently, allowed, to, remain, free, according, to, hesiod, the, titan, offspring, of, uranus, and, gaia, were, oceanus, coeus, crius, hyperion, iapetus, theia, rhea, themis, mnemosyne, phoebe, tethys, and, cronus, eight, of, the, titan, brothers, and, sisters, married, each, other, oceanus, and, tethys, coeus, and, phoebe, hyperion, and, theia, and, cronus, and, rhea, the, other, two, titan, brothers, married, outside, their, immediate, family, iapetus, married, his, niece, clymene, the, daughter, of, oceanus, and, tethys, while, crius, married, his, half, sister, eurybia, the, daughter, of, gaia, and, pontus, the, two, remaining, titan, sisters, themis, and, mnemosyne, became, wives, of, their, nephew, zeus, from, oceanus, and, tethys, came, the, three, thousand, river, gods, and, three, thousand, oceanid, nymphs, from, coeus, and, phoebe, came, leto, another, wife, of, zeus, and, asteria, from, crius, and, eurybia, came, astraeus, pallas, and, perses, from, hyperion, and, theia, came, the, celestial, personifications, helios, sun, selene, moon, and, eos, dawn, from, iapetus, and, clymene, came, atlas, menoetius, prometheus, and, epimetheus, from, cronus, and, rhea, came, the, olympians, hestia, demeter, hera, hades, poseidon, and, zeus, by, zeus, themis, bore, the, three, horae, hours, and, the, three, moirai, fates, and, mnemosyne, bore, the, nine, muses, while, the, descendants, of, the, titans, oceanus, and, tethys, cronus, and, rhea, themis, and, mnemosyne, i, e, the, river, gods, the, oceanids, the, olympians, the, horae, the, moirai, and, the, muses, are, not, normally, considered, to, be, titans, descendants, of, the, other, titans, notably, leto, helios, atlas, and, prometheus, are, themselves, sometimes, referred, to, as, titans, passages, in, a, section, of, the, iliad, called, the, deception, of, zeus, suggest, the, possibility, that, homer, knew, of, a, tradition, in, which, oceanus, and, tethys, rather, than, uranus, and, gaia, as, in, hesiod, were, the, parents, of, the, titans, twice, homer, has, hera, describe, the, pair, as, oceanus, from, whom, the, gods, are, sprung, and, mother, tethys, while, in, the, same, passage, hypnos, describes, oceanus, as, from, whom, they, all, are, sprung, plato, in, his, timaeus, provides, a, genealogy, probably, orphic, which, perhaps, reflected, an, attempt, to, reconcile, this, apparent, divergence, between, homer, and, hesiod, with, uranus, and, gaia, as, the, parents, of, oceanus, and, tethys, and, oceanus, and, tethys, as, the, parents, of, cronus, and, rhea, and, all, that, go, with, them, plus, phorcys, in, his, cratylus, plato, quotes, orpheus, as, saying, that, oceanus, and, tethys, were, the, first, to, marry, possibly, also, reflecting, an, orphic, theogony, in, which, oceanus, and, tethys, rather, than, uranus, and, gaia, were, the, primeval, parents, to, hesiod, s, twelve, titans, the, mythographer, apollodorus, adds, a, thirteenth, titan, dione, the, mother, of, aphrodite, by, zeus, plato, s, inclusion, of, phorkys, apparently, as, a, titan, and, the, mythographer, apollodorus, s, inclusion, of, dione, suggests, an, orphic, tradition, in, which, the, canonical, twelve, titans, consisted, of, hesiod, s, twelve, with, phorkys, and, dione, taking, the, place, of, oceanus, and, tethys, the, roman, mythographer, hyginus, in, his, somewhat, confused, genealogy, after, listing, as, offspring, of, aether, upper, sky, and, earth, gaia, ocean, themis, tartarus, and, pontus, next, lists, the, titans, followed, by, two, of, hesiod, s, hundred, handers, briareus, and, gyges, one, of, hesiod, s, three, cyclopes, steropes, then, continues, his, list, with, atlas, hyperion, and, polus, saturn, ops, moneta, dione, and, the, three, furies, alecto, megaera, and, tisiphone, the, geographer, pausanias, mentions, seeing, the, image, of, a, man, in, armor, who, was, supposed, to, be, the, titan, anytos, who, was, said, to, have, raised, the, arcadian, despoina, the, titans, as, a, group, represent, a, pre, olympian, order, hesiod, uses, the, expression, the, former, gods, theoi, proteroi, in, reference, to, the, titans, they, were, the, banished, gods, who, were, no, longer, part, of, the, upper, world, rather, they, were, the, gods, who, dwelt, underground, in, tartarus, and, as, such, they, may, have, been, thought, of, as, gods, of, the, underworld, who, were, the, antithesis, of, and, in, opposition, to, the, olympians, the, gods, of, the, heavens, hesiod, called, the, titans, earth, born, chthonic, and, in, the, homeric, hymn, to, apollo, hera, prays, to, the, titans, who, dwell, beneath, the, earth, calling, on, them, to, aid, her, against, zeus, just, as, if, they, were, chthonic, spirits, in, a, similar, fashion, in, the, iliad, hera, upon, swearing, an, oath, by, the, underworld, river, styx, invoked, by, name, all, the, gods, below, tartarus, that, are, called, titans, as, witnesses, they, were, the, older, gods, but, not, apparently, as, was, once, thought, the, old, gods, of, an, indigenous, group, in, greece, historically, displaced, by, the, new, gods, of, greek, invaders, rather, they, were, a, group, of, gods, whose, mythology, at, least, seems, to, have, been, borrowed, from, the, near, east, see, near, east, origins, below, these, imported, gods, gave, context, and, provided, a, backstory, for, the, olympian, gods, explaining, where, these, greek, olympian, gods, had, come, from, and, how, they, had, come, to, occupy, their, position, of, supremacy, in, the, cosmos, the, titans, were, the, previous, generation, and, family, of, gods, whom, the, olympians, had, to, overthrow, and, banish, from, the, upper, world, in, order, to, become, the, ruling, pantheon, of, greek, gods, for, hesiod, possibly, in, order, to, match, the, twelve, olympian, gods, there, were, twelve, titans, six, males, and, six, females, with, some, of, hesiod, s, names, perhaps, being, mere, poetic, inventions, so, as, to, arrive, at, the, right, number, in, hesiod, s, theogony, apart, from, cronus, the, titans, play, no, part, at, all, in, the, overthrow, of, uranus, and, we, only, hear, of, their, collective, action, in, the, titanomachy, their, war, with, the, olympians, as, a, group, they, have, no, further, role, in, conventional, greek, myth, nor, do, they, play, any, part, in, greek, cult, as, individuals, few, of, the, titans, have, any, separate, identity, aside, from, cronus, the, only, other, figure, homer, mentions, by, name, as, being, a, titan, is, iapetus, some, titans, seem, only, to, serve, a, genealogical, function, providing, parents, for, more, important, offspring, coeus, and, phoebe, as, the, parents, of, leto, the, mother, by, zeus, of, the, olympians, apollo, and, artemis, hyperion, and, theia, as, the, parents, of, helios, selene, and, eos, iapetus, as, the, father, of, atlas, and, prometheus, and, crius, as, the, father, of, three, sons, astraeus, pallas, and, perses, who, themselves, seem, only, to, exist, to, provide, fathers, for, more, important, figures, such, as, the, anemoi, winds, nike, victory, and, hecate, the, titans, play, a, key, role, in, an, important, part, of, greek, mythology, the, succession, myth, it, told, how, the, titan, cronus, the, youngest, of, the, titans, overthrew, uranus, and, how, in, turn, zeus, by, waging, and, winning, a, great, ten, year, war, pitting, the, new, gods, against, the, old, gods, called, the, titanomachy, titan, war, overthrew, cronus, and, his, fellow, titans, and, was, eventually, established, as, the, final, and, permanent, ruler, of, the, cosmos, according, to, the, standard, version, of, the, succession, myth, given, in, hesiod, s, theogony, uranus, initially, produced, eighteen, children, with, gaia, the, twelve, titans, the, three, cyclopes, and, the, three, hecatoncheires, hundred, handers, but, hating, them, he, hid, them, away, somewhere, inside, gaia, angry, and, in, distress, gaia, fashioned, a, sickle, made, of, adamant, and, urged, her, children, to, punish, their, father, only, her, son, cronus, was, willing, so, gaia, hid, cronus, in, ambush, gave, him, an, adamantine, sickle, and, when, uranus, came, to, lie, with, gaia, cronus, reached, out, and, castrated, his, father, this, enabled, the, titans, to, be, born, and, cronus, to, assume, supreme, command, of, the, cosmos, with, the, titans, as, his, subordinates, cronus, having, now, taken, over, control, of, the, cosmos, from, uranus, wanted, to, ensure, that, he, maintained, control, uranus, and, gaia, had, prophesied, to, cronus, that, one, of, cronus, own, children, would, overthrow, him, so, when, cronus, married, rhea, he, made, sure, to, swallow, each, of, the, children, she, birthed, this, he, did, with, the, first, five, hestia, demeter, hera, hades, poseidon, in, that, order, to, rhea, s, great, sorrow, however, when, rhea, was, pregnant, with, zeus, rhea, begged, her, parents, gaia, and, uranus, to, help, her, save, zeus, so, they, sent, rhea, to, lyctus, on, crete, to, bear, zeus, and, gaia, took, the, newborn, zeus, to, raise, hiding, him, deep, in, a, cave, beneath, mount, aigaion, meanwhile, rhea, gave, cronus, a, huge, stone, wrapped, in, baby, s, clothes, which, he, swallowed, thinking, that, it, was, another, of, rhea, s, children, zeus, now, grown, forced, cronus, using, some, unspecified, trickery, of, gaia, to, disgorge, his, other, five, children, zeus, then, released, his, uncles, the, cyclopes, apparently, still, imprisoned, beneath, the, earth, along, with, the, hundred, handers, where, uranus, had, originally, confined, them, who, then, provide, zeus, with, his, great, weapon, the, thunderbolt, which, had, been, hidden, by, gaia, a, great, war, was, begun, the, titanomachy, for, control, of, the, cosmos, the, titans, fought, from, mount, othrys, while, the, olympians, fought, from, mount, olympus, in, the, tenth, year, of, that, great, war, following, gaia, s, counsel, zeus, released, the, hundred, handers, who, joined, the, war, against, the, titans, helping, zeus, to, gain, the, upper, hand, zeus, cast, the, fury, of, his, thunderbolt, at, the, titans, defeating, them, and, throwing, them, into, tartarus, with, the, hundred, handers, as, their, guards, only, brief, references, to, the, titans, and, the, succession, myth, are, found, in, homer, in, the, iliad, homer, tells, us, that, the, gods, that, are, called, titans, reside, in, tartarus, specifically, homer, says, that, iapetus, and, cronos, have, joy, neither, in, the, rays, of, helios, hyperion, nor, in, any, breeze, but, deep, tartarus, is, round, about, them, and, further, that, zeus, thrust, cronos, down, to, dwell, beneath, earth, and, the, unresting, sea, brief, mentions, of, the, titanomachy, and, the, imprisonment, of, the, titans, in, tartarus, also, occur, in, the, homeric, hymn, to, apollo, and, aeschylus, prometheus, bound, in, the, hymn, hera, angry, at, zeus, calls, upon, the, titan, gods, who, dwell, beneath, the, earth, about, great, tartarus, and, from, whom, are, sprung, both, gods, and, men, in, prometheus, bound, prometheus, the, son, of, the, titan, iapetus, refers, to, the, titanomachy, and, his, part, in, it, when, first, the, heavenly, powers, were, moved, to, wrath, and, mutual, dissension, was, stirred, up, among, them, some, bent, on, casting, cronus, from, his, seat, so, zeus, in, truth, might, reign, others, eager, for, the, contrary, end, that, zeus, might, never, win, mastery, over, the, gods, it, was, then, that, i, although, advising, them, for, the, best, was, unable, to, persuade, the, titans, children, of, heaven, and, earth, but, they, disdaining, counsels, of, craft, in, the, pride, of, their, strength, thought, to, gain, the, mastery, without, a, struggle, and, by, force, that, it, was, not, by, brute, strength, nor, through, violence, but, by, guile, that, those, who, should, gain, the, upper, hand, were, destined, to, prevail, and, though, i, argued, all, this, to, them, they, did, not, pay, any, attention, to, my, words, with, all, that, before, me, it, seemed, best, that, joining, with, my, mother, i, should, place, myself, a, welcome, volunteer, on, the, side, of, zeus, and, it, is, by, reason, of, my, counsel, that, the, cavernous, gloom, of, tartarus, now, hides, ancient, cronus, and, his, allies, within, it, the, mythographer, apollodorus, gives, a, similar, account, of, the, succession, myth, to, hesiod, s, but, with, a, few, significant, differences, according, to, apollodorus, there, were, thirteen, original, titans, adding, the, titaness, dione, to, hesiod, s, list, the, titans, instead, of, being, uranus, firstborn, as, in, hesiod, were, born, after, the, three, hundred, handers, and, the, three, cyclopes, and, while, uranus, imprisoned, these, first, six, of, his, offspring, he, apparently, left, the, titans, free, not, just, cronus, but, all, the, titans, except, oceanus, attacked, uranus, after, cronus, castrated, uranus, the, titans, freed, the, hundred, handers, and, cyclopes, unlike, in, hesiod, where, they, apparently, remained, imprisoned, and, made, cronus, their, sovereign, who, then, reimprisoned, the, hundred, handers, and, cyclopes, in, tartarus, although, hesiod, does, not, say, how, zeus, was, eventually, able, to, free, his, siblings, according, to, apollodorus, zeus, was, aided, by, oceanus, daughter, metis, who, gave, cronus, an, emetic, which, forced, him, to, disgorge, his, children, that, he, had, swallowed, according, to, apollodorus, in, the, tenth, year, of, the, ensuing, war, zeus, learned, from, gaia, that, he, would, be, victorious, if, he, had, the, hundred, handers, and, the, cyclopes, as, allies, so, zeus, slew, their, warder, campe, a, detail, not, found, in, hesiod, and, released, them, and, in, addition, to, giving, zeus, his, thunderbolt, as, in, hesiod, the, cyclopes, also, gave, poseidon, his, trident, and, hades, a, helmet, and, with, these, weapons, the, gods, overcame, the, titans, shut, them, up, in, tartarus, and, appointed, the, hundred, handers, their, guards, the, roman, mythographer, hyginus, in, his, fabulae, gives, an, unusual, and, perhaps, confused, account, of, the, titanomachy, according, to, hyginus, the, titanomachy, came, about, because, of, a, dispute, between, jupiter, and, juno, the, roman, equivalents, of, zeus, and, hera, juno, jupiter, s, jealous, wife, was, angry, at, her, husband, on, account, of, jupiter, s, son, epaphus, by, io, one, of, her, husband, s, many, lovers, because, of, this, juno, incited, the, titans, to, rebel, against, jupiter, and, restore, saturn, cronus, to, the, kingship, of, the, gods, jupiter, with, the, help, of, minerva, athena, apollo, and, diana, artemis, put, down, the, rebellion, and, hurled, the, titans, as, in, other, accounts, down, to, tartarus, after, being, overthrown, in, the, titanomachy, cronus, and, his, fellow, vanquished, titans, were, cast, into, tartarus, that, is, where, the, titan, gods, are, hidden, under, murky, gloom, by, the, plans, of, the, cloud, gatherer, zeus, in, a, dank, place, at, the, farthest, part, of, huge, earth, they, cannot, get, out, for, poseidon, has, set, bronze, gates, upon, it, and, a, wall, is, extended, on, both, sides, however, besides, cronus, exactly, which, of, the, other, titans, were, supposed, to, have, been, imprisoned, in, tartarus, is, unclear, the, only, original, titan, mentioned, by, name, as, being, confined, with, cronus, in, tartarus, is, iapetus, but, not, all, the, titans, were, imprisoned, there, certainly, oceanus, the, great, world, encircling, river, seems, to, have, remained, free, and, in, fact, seems, not, to, have, fought, on, the, titans, side, at, all, in, hesiod, oceanus, sends, his, daughter, styx, with, her, children, zelus, envy, nike, victory, kratos, power, and, bia, force, to, fight, on, zeus, side, against, the, titans, while, in, the, iliad, hera, says, that, during, the, titanomachy, she, was, cared, for, by, oceanus, and, his, wife, the, titaness, tethys, aeschylus, prometheus, bound, has, oceanus, free, to, visit, his, nephew, prometheus, sometime, after, the, war, like, oceanus, helios, the, titan, son, of, hyperion, certainly, remained, free, to, drive, his, sun, chariot, daily, across, the, sky, taking, an, active, part, in, events, subsequent, to, the, titanomachy, the, freedom, of, oceanus, along, with, helios, sun, and, perhaps, hyperion, to, the, extent, that, he, also, represented, the, sun, would, seem, to, be, the, result, of, cosmological, necessity, for, how, could, a, world, encircling, river, or, the, sun, be, confined, in, tartarus, as, for, other, male, offspring, of, the, titans, some, seem, to, have, participated, in, the, titanomachy, and, were, punished, as, a, result, and, others, did, not, or, at, least, like, helios, remained, free, three, of, iapetus, sons, atlas, menoetius, and, prometheus, are, specifically, connected, by, ancient, sources, with, the, war, in, the, theogony, both, atlas, and, menoetius, received, punishments, from, zeus, but, hesiod, does, not, say, for, what, crime, exactly, they, were, punished, atlas, was, famously, punished, by, zeus, by, being, forced, to, hold, up, the, sky, on, his, shoulders, but, none, of, the, early, sources, for, this, story, hesiod, homer, pindar, and, aeschylus, say, that, his, punishment, was, as, a, result, of, the, war, according, to, hyginus, however, atlas, led, the, titans, in, a, revolt, against, zeus, jupiter, the, theogony, has, menoetius, struck, down, by, zeus, thunderbolt, and, cast, into, erebus, because, of, his, mad, presumption, and, exceeding, pride, whether, hesiod, was, using, erebus, as, another, name, for, tartarus, as, was, sometimes, done, or, meant, that, menoetius, s, punishment, was, because, of, his, participation, in, the, titanomachy, is, unclear, and, no, other, early, source, mentions, this, event, however, apollodorus, says, that, it, was, hesiod, does, not, mention, prometheus, in, connection, with, the, titanomachy, but, prometheus, does, remain, free, in, the, theogony, for, his, deception, of, zeus, at, mecone, and, his, subsequent, theft, of, fire, for, which, transgressions, prometheus, was, famously, punished, by, zeus, by, being, chained, to, a, rock, where, an, eagle, came, to, eat, his, immortal, liver, every, day, which, then, grew, back, every, night, however, aeschylus, s, prometheus, bound, as, mentioned, above, does, have, prometheus, say, that, he, was, an, ally, of, zeus, during, the, titanomachy, the, female, titans, to, the, extent, that, they, are, mentioned, at, all, appear, also, to, have, been, allowed, to, remain, free, three, of, these, according, to, the, theogony, become, wives, of, zeus, themis, mnemosyne, and, leto, the, daughter, of, the, titans, coeus, and, phoebe, themis, gives, birth, to, the, three, horae, hours, and, the, three, moirai, fates, and, mnemosyne, gives, birth, to, the, nine, muses, leto, who, gives, birth, to, the, olympians, apollo, and, artemis, takes, an, active, part, on, the, side, of, the, trojans, in, the, iliad, and, is, also, involved, in, the, story, of, the, giant, tityos, tethys, presumably, along, with, her, husband, oceanus, took, no, part, in, the, war, and, as, mentioned, above, provided, safe, refuge, for, hera, during, the, war, rhea, remains, free, and, active, after, the, war, appearing, at, leto, s, delivery, of, apollo, as, zeus, messenger, to, demeter, announcing, the, settlement, concerning, persephone, bringing, pelops, back, to, life, while, in, hesiod, s, theogony, and, homer, s, iliad, cronus, and, the, other, titans, are, confined, to, tartarus, apparently, forever, another, tradition, as, indicated, by, later, sources, seems, to, have, had, cronus, or, other, of, the, titans, being, eventually, set, free, pindar, in, one, of, his, poems, 462, bc, says, that, although, atlas, still, strains, against, the, weight, of, the, sky, zeus, freed, the, titans, and, in, another, poem, 476, bc, pindar, has, cronus, in, fact, ruling, in, the, isles, of, the, blessed, a, land, where, the, greek, heroes, reside, in, the, afterlife, those, who, have, persevered, three, times, on, either, side, to, keep, their, souls, free, from, all, wrongdoing, follow, zeus, road, to, the, end, to, the, tower, of, cronus, where, ocean, breezes, blow, around, the, island, of, the, blessed, and, flowers, of, gold, are, blazing, some, from, splendid, trees, on, land, while, water, nurtures, others, with, these, wreaths, and, garlands, of, flowers, they, entwine, their, hands, according, to, the, righteous, counsels, of, rhadamanthys, whom, the, great, father, the, husband, of, rhea, whose, throne, is, above, all, others, keeps, close, beside, him, as, his, partner, prometheus, lyomenos, an, undated, lost, play, by, aeschylus, c, 525, c, 455, bc, had, a, chorus, composed, of, freed, titans, possibly, even, earlier, than, pindar, and, aeschylus, two, papyrus, versions, of, a, passage, of, hesiods, works, and, days, also, mention, cronus, being, released, by, zeus, and, ruling, over, the, heroes, who, go, to, the, isle, of, the, blessed, but, other, versions, of, hesiod, s, text, do, not, and, most, editors, judge, these, lines, of, text, to, be, later, interpolations, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, greek, succession, myth, was, imported, from, the, near, east, and, that, along, with, this, imported, myth, came, stories, of, a, group, of, former, ruling, gods, who, had, been, defeated, and, displaced, and, who, became, identified, by, the, greeks, as, the, titans, features, of, hesiod, s, account, of, the, titans, can, be, seen, in, the, stories, of, the, hurrians, the, hittites, the, babylonians, and, other, near, eastern, cultures, the, hurro, hittite, text, song, of, kumarbi, also, called, kingship, in, heaven, written, five, hundred, years, before, hesiod, tells, of, a, succession, of, kings, in, heaven, anu, sky, kumarbi, and, the, storm, god, teshub, with, many, striking, parallels, to, hesiod, s, account, of, the, greek, succession, myth, like, cronus, kumarbi, castrates, the, sky, god, anu, and, takes, over, his, kingship, and, like, cronus, kumarbi, swallows, gods, and, a, stone, one, of, whom, is, the,

role, in, what, is, often, considered, to, be, the, central, myth, of, orphism, the, sparagmos, that, is, the, dismemberment, of, dionysus, who, in, this, context, is, often, given, the, title, zagreus, as, pieced, together, from, various, ancient, sources, the, reconstructed, story, usually, given, by, modern, scholars, goes, as, follows, zeus, had, intercourse, with, persephone, in, the, form, of, a, serpent, producing, dionysus, he, is, taken, to, mount, ida, where, like, the, infant, zeus, he, is, guarded, by, the, dancing, curetes, zeus, intended, dionysus, to, be, his, successor, as, ruler, of, the, cosmos, but, a, jealous, hera, incited, the, titans, who, apparently, unlike, in, hesiod, and, homer, were, not, imprisoned, in, tartarus, to, kill, the, child, the, titans, whiten, their, faces, with, gypsum, and, distracting, the, infant, dionysus, with, various, toys, including, a, mirror, they, seized, dionysus, and, tore, or, cut, him, to, pieces, the, pieces, were, then, boiled, roasted, and, partially, eaten, by, the, titans, but, athena, managed, to, save, dionysus, heart, by, which, zeus, was, able, to, contrive, his, rebirth, from, semele, commonly, presented, as, a, part, of, the, myth, of, the, dismembered, dionysus, zagreus, is, an, orphic, anthropogony, that, is, an, orphic, account, of, the, origin, of, human, beings, according, to, this, widely, held, view, as, punishment, for, their, crime, zeus, struck, the, titans, with, his, thunderbolt, and, from, the, remains, of, the, destroyed, titans, humankind, was, born, which, resulted, in, a, human, inheritance, of, ancestral, guilt, for, this, original, sin, of, the, titans, and, by, some, accounts, formed, the, basis, for, an, orphic, doctrine, of, the, divinity, of, man, however, when, and, to, what, extent, there, existed, any, orphic, tradition, which, included, these, elements, is, the, subject, of, open, debate, the, 2nd, century, ad, biographer, and, essayist, plutarch, makes, a, connection, between, the, sparagmos, and, the, punishment, of, the, titans, but, makes, no, mention, of, the, anthropogony, or, orpheus, or, orphism, in, his, essay, on, the, eating, of, flesh, plutarch, writes, of, stories, told, about, the, sufferings, and, dismemberment, of, dionysus, and, the, outrageous, assaults, of, the, titans, upon, him, and, their, punishment, and, blasting, by, thunderbolt, after, they, had, tasted, his, blood, while, according, to, the, early, 4th, century, ad, christian, apologist, arnobius, and, the, 5th, century, ad, greek, epic, poet, nonnus, it, is, as, punishment, for, their, murder, of, dionysus, that, the, titans, end, up, imprisoned, by, zeus, in, tartarus, the, only, ancient, source, to, explicitly, connect, the, sparagmos, and, the, anthropogony, is, the, 6th, century, ad, neoplatonist, olympiodorus, who, writes, that, according, to, orpheus, after, the, titans, had, dismembered, and, eaten, dionysus, zeus, angered, by, the, deed, blasts, them, with, his, thunderbolts, and, from, the, sublimate, of, the, vapors, that, rise, from, them, comes, the, matter, from, which, men, are, created, olympiodorus, goes, on, to, conclude, that, because, the, titans, had, eaten, his, flesh, we, their, descendants, are, a, part, of, dionysus, some, 19th, and, 20th, century, scholars, including, jane, ellen, harrison, have, argued, that, an, initiatory, or, shamanic, ritual, underlies, the, myth, of, the, dismemberment, and, cannibalism, of, dionysus, by, the, titans, martin, litchfield, west, also, asserts, this, in, relation, to, shamanistic, initiatory, rites, of, early, greek, religious, practices, the, etymology, of, i, titanes, is, uncertain, hesiod, in, the, theogony, gives, a, double, etymology, deriving, it, from, titaino, and, tisis, saying, that, uranus, gave, them, the, name, titans, in, reproach, for, he, said, that, they, strained, and, did, presumptuously, a, fearful, deed, and, that, vengeance, for, it, would, come, afterwards, but, modern, scholars, doubt, hesiod, s, etymology, jane, ellen, harrison, asserts, that, the, word, titan, comes, from, the, greek, signifying, white, earth, clay, or, gypsum, and, that, the, titans, were, white, clay, men, or, men, covered, by, white, clay, or, gypsum, dust, in, their, rituals, the, planet, saturn, is, named, for, the, roman, equivalent, of,
