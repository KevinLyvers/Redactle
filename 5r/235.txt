the, eucharist, ju, k, r, s, t, yoo, k, r, ist, from, koin, greek, romanized, evcharist, a, lit, thanksgiving, also, known, as, holy, communion, the, blessed, sacrament, and, the, lord, s, supper, is, a, christian, rite, that, is, considered, a, sacrament, in, most, churches, and, as, an, ordinance, in, others, christians, believe, that, the, rite, was, instituted, by, jesus, at, the, last, supper, the, night, before, his, crucifixion, giving, his, disciples, bread, and, wine, passages, in, the, new, testament, state, that, he, commanded, them, to, do, this, in, memory, of, me, while, referring, to, the, bread, as, my, body, and, the, cup, of, wine, as, the, blood, of, my, covenant, which, is, poured, out, for, many, according, to, the, synoptic, gospels, this, was, at, a, passover, meal, the, elements, of, the, eucharist, bread, either, leavened, or, unleavened, and, wine, non, alcoholic, grape, juice, in, some, protestant, traditions, are, consecrated, on, an, altar, or, a, communion, table, and, consumed, thereafter, the, consecrated, elements, are, the, end, product, of, the, eucharistic, prayer, christians, generally, recognize, a, special, presence, of, christ, in, this, rite, though, they, differ, about, exactly, how, where, and, when, christ, is, present, the, catholic, church, states, that, the, eucharist, is, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, under, the, species, of, bread, and, wine, it, maintains, that, by, the, consecration, the, substances, of, the, bread, and, wine, actually, become, the, substances, of, the, body, and, blood, of, jesus, christ, transubstantiation, while, the, appearances, of, the, bread, and, wine, remain, unaltered, e, g, colour, taste, feel, and, smell, the, eastern, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, churches, agree, that, an, objective, change, occurs, of, the, bread, and, wine, into, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, lutherans, believe, the, true, body, and, blood, of, christ, are, really, present, in, with, and, under, the, forms, of, the, bread, and, wine, known, as, the, sacramental, union, reformed, christians, believe, in, a, real, spiritual, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, anglican, eucharistic, theologies, universally, affirm, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, though, evangelical, anglicans, believe, that, this, is, a, spiritual, presence, while, anglo, catholics, hold, to, a, corporeal, presence, as, a, result, of, these, different, understandings, the, eucharist, has, been, a, central, issue, in, the, discussions, and, deliberations, of, the, ecumenical, movement, the, new, testament, was, originally, written, in, the, greek, language, and, the, greek, noun, eucharistia, meaning, thanksgiving, appears, a, few, times, in, it, while, the, related, greek, verb, is, found, several, times, in, new, testament, accounts, of, the, last, supper, including, the, earliest, such, account, for, i, received, from, the, lord, what, i, also, delivered, to, you, that, the, lord, jesus, on, the, night, when, he, was, betrayed, took, bread, and, when, he, had, given, thanks, he, broke, it, and, said, this, is, my, body, which, is, for, you, do, this, in, remembrance, of, me, the, term, eucharistia, thanksgiving, is, that, by, which, the, rite, is, referred, to, in, the, didache, a, late, 1st, or, early, 2nd, century, document, 51, 437, 207, by, ignatius, of, antioch, who, died, between, 98, and, 117, and, by, justin, martyr, first, apology, written, between, 155, and, 157, today, the, eucharist, is, the, name, still, used, by, eastern, orthodox, oriental, orthodox, catholics, anglicans, presbyterians, and, lutherans, other, protestant, denominations, rarely, use, this, term, preferring, communion, the, lord, s, supper, remembrance, or, the, breaking, of, bread, latter, day, saints, call, it, the, sacrament, in, the, first, epistle, to, the, corinthians, paul, uses, the, term, lord, s, supper, in, greek, kyriakon, deipnon, in, the, early, 50s, of, the, 1st, century, when, you, come, together, it, is, not, the, lord, s, supper, you, eat, for, as, you, eat, each, of, you, goes, ahead, without, waiting, for, anybody, else, one, remains, hungry, another, gets, drunk, so, paul, s, use, of, the, term, lord, s, supper, in, reference, to, the, corinthian, banquet, is, powerful, and, interesting, but, to, be, an, actual, name, for, the, christian, meal, rather, than, a, meaningful, phrase, connected, with, an, ephemeral, rhetorical, contrast, it, would, have, to, have, some, history, previous, or, subsequent, nevertheless, given, its, existence, in, the, biblical, text, lord, s, supper, came, into, use, after, the, protestant, reformation, and, remains, the, predominant, term, among, evangelicals, such, as, baptists, and, pentecostals, 123, 259, 371, they, also, refer, to, the, observance, as, an, ordinance, rather, than, a, sacrament, use, of, the, term, communion, or, holy, communion, to, refer, to, the, eucharistic, rite, began, by, some, groups, originating, in, the, protestant, reformation, others, such, as, the, catholic, church, do, not, formally, use, this, term, for, the, rite, but, instead, mean, by, it, the, act, of, partaking, of, the, consecrated, elements, they, speak, of, receiving, holy, communion, at, mass, or, outside, of, it, they, also, use, the, term, first, communion, when, one, receives, the, eucharist, for, the, first, time, the, term, communion, is, derived, from, latin, communio, sharing, in, common, translated, from, the, greek, koin, n, a, in, 1, corinthians, 10, 16, the, cup, of, blessing, which, we, bless, is, it, not, the, communion, of, the, blood, of, christ, the, bread, which, we, break, is, it, not, the, communion, of, the, body, of, christ, the, phrase, klasis, tou, artou, breaking, of, the, bread, in, later, liturgical, greek, also, artoklasia, appears, in, various, related, forms, five, times, in, the, new, testament, in, contexts, which, according, to, some, may, refer, to, the, celebration, of, the, eucharist, in, either, closer, or, symbolically, more, distant, reference, to, the, last, supper, this, term, is, used, by, the, plymouth, brethren, the, blessed, sacrament, the, sacrament, of, the, altar, and, other, variations, are, common, terms, used, by, catholics, lutherans, and, some, anglicans, anglo, catholics, for, the, consecrated, elements, particularly, when, reserved, in, a, tabernacle, in, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, term, the, sacrament, is, used, of, the, rite, the, term, mass, is, used, in, the, catholic, church, the, lutheran, churches, especially, the, churches, of, sweden, norway, and, finland, and, by, some, anglicans, it, derives, from, the, latin, word, missa, a, dismissal, ite, missa, est, or, go, it, is, sent, the, very, last, phrase, of, the, service, that, latin, word, has, come, to, imply, mission, as, well, because, the, congregation, is, sent, out, to, serve, christ, at, least, in, the, catholic, church, the, mass, is, a, long, rite, in, two, parts, the, liturgy, of, the, word, and, the, liturgy, of, the, eucharist, the, former, consists, of, readings, from, the, bible, and, a, homily, or, sermon, given, by, a, priest, or, deacon, the, latter, which, follows, seamlessly, includes, the, offering, of, the, bread, and, wine, at, the, altar, their, consecration, by, the, priest, through, prayer, and, their, reception, by, the, congregation, in, holy, communion, among, the, many, other, terms, used, in, the, catholic, church, are, holy, mass, the, memorial, of, the, passion, death, and, resurrection, of, the, lord, the, holy, sacrifice, of, the, mass, and, the, holy, mysteries, the, term, divine, liturgy, greek, is, used, in, byzantine, rite, traditions, whether, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, or, among, the, eastern, catholic, churches, these, also, speak, of, the, divine, mysteries, especially, in, reference, to, the, consecrated, elements, which, they, also, call, the, holy, gifts, the, term, divine, service, german, gottesdienst, has, often, been, used, to, refer, to, christian, worship, more, generally, and, is, still, used, in, lutheran, churches, in, addition, to, the, terms, eucharist, mass, and, holy, communion, historically, this, refers, like, the, term, worship, itself, to, service, of, god, although, more, recently, it, has, been, associated, with, the, idea, that, god, is, serving, the, congregants, in, the, liturgy, some, eastern, rites, have, yet, more, names, for, the, eucharist, holy, qurbana, is, common, in, syriac, christianity, and, badarak, in, the, armenian, rite, in, the, alexandrian, rite, the, term, prosphora, from, the, greek, is, common, in, coptic, christianity, and, keddase, in, ethiopian, and, eritrean, christianity, the, last, supper, appears, in, all, three, synoptic, gospels, matthew, mark, and, luke, it, also, is, found, in, the, first, epistle, to, the, corinthians, which, suggests, how, early, christians, celebrated, what, paul, the, apostle, called, the, lord, s, supper, although, the, gospel, of, john, does, not, reference, the, last, supper, explicitly, some, argue, that, it, contains, theological, allusions, to, the, early, christian, celebration, of, the, eucharist, especially, in, the, chapter, 6, bread, of, life, discourse, but, also, in, other, passages, in, the, synoptic, gospels, mark, 14, 22, 25, matthew, 26, 26, 29, and, luke, 22, 13, 20, depict, jesus, as, presiding, over, the, last, supper, prior, to, his, crucifixion, the, versions, in, matthew, and, mark, are, almost, identical, but, the, gospel, of, luke, presents, a, textual, difference, in, that, a, few, manuscripts, omit, the, second, half, of, verse, 19, and, all, of, verse, 20, given, for, you, poured, out, for, you, which, are, found, in, the, vast, majority, of, ancient, witnesses, to, the, text, if, the, shorter, text, is, the, original, one, then, luke, s, account, is, independent, of, both, that, of, paul, and, that, of, matthew, mark, if, the, majority, longer, text, comes, from, the, author, of, the, third, gospel, then, this, version, is, very, similar, to, that, of, paul, in, 1, corinthians, being, somewhat, fuller, in, its, description, of, the, early, part, of, the, supper, particularly, in, making, specific, mention, of, a, cup, being, blessed, before, the, bread, was, broken, in, the, one, prayer, given, to, posterity, by, jesus, the, lord, s, prayer, the, word, epiousion, which, is, otherwise, unknown, in, classical, greek, literature, was, interpreted, by, some, early, christian, writers, as, meaning, super, substantial, and, hence, a, possible, reference, to, the, eucharist, as, the, bread, of, life, in, the, gospel, of, john, however, the, account, of, the, last, supper, does, not, mention, jesus, taking, bread, and, the, cup, and, speaking, of, them, as, his, body, and, blood, instead, it, recounts, other, events, his, humble, act, of, washing, the, disciples, feet, the, prophecy, of, the, betrayal, which, set, in, motion, the, events, that, would, lead, to, the, cross, and, his, long, discourse, in, response, to, some, questions, posed, by, his, followers, in, which, he, went, on, to, speak, of, the, importance, of, the, unity, of, the, disciples, with, him, with, each, other, and, with, god, some, would, find, in, this, unity, and, in, the, washing, of, the, feet, the, deeper, meaning, of, the, communion, bread, in, the, other, three, gospels, in, john, 6, 26, 65, a, long, discourse, is, attributed, to, jesus, that, deals, with, the, subject, of, the, living, bread, john, 6, 51, 59, also, contains, echoes, of, eucharistic, language, 1, corinthians, 11, 23, 25, gives, the, earliest, recorded, description, of, jesus, last, supper, the, lord, jesus, on, the, night, when, he, was, betrayed, took, bread, and, when, he, had, given, thanks, he, broke, it, and, said, this, is, my, body, which, is, for, you, do, this, in, remembrance, of, me, the, greek, word, used, in, the, passage, for, remembrance, is, anamnesis, which, itself, has, a, much, richer, theological, history, than, the, english, word, remember, the, expression, the, lord, s, supper, derived, from, paul, s, usage, in, 1, corinthians, 11, 17, 34, may, have, originally, referred, to, the, agape, feast, or, love, feast, the, shared, communal, meal, with, which, the, eucharist, was, originally, associated, the, agape, feast, is, mentioned, in, jude, 12, but, the, lord, s, supper, is, now, commonly, used, in, reference, to, a, celebration, involving, no, food, other, than, the, sacramental, bread, and, wine, the, didache, greek, teaching, is, an, early, church, treatise, that, includes, instructions, for, baptism, and, the, eucharist, most, scholars, date, it, to, the, late, 1st, century, and, distinguish, in, it, two, separate, eucharistic, traditions, the, earlier, tradition, in, chapter, 10, and, the, later, one, preceding, it, in, chapter, 9, the, eucharist, is, mentioned, again, in, chapter, 14, ignatius, of, antioch, born, c, 35, or, 50, died, between, 98, and, 117, one, of, the, apostolic, fathers, mentions, the, eucharist, as, the, flesh, of, our, saviour, jesus, christ, they, abstain, from, the, eucharist, and, from, prayer, because, they, confess, not, the, eucharist, to, be, the, flesh, of, our, saviour, jesus, christ, which, suffered, for, our, sins, and, which, the, father, of, his, goodness, raised, up, again, let, that, be, deemed, a, proper, eucharist, which, is, either, by, the, bishop, or, by, one, to, whom, he, has, entrusted, it, take, heed, then, to, have, but, one, eucharist, for, there, is, one, flesh, of, our, lord, jesus, christ, and, one, cup, to, the, unity, of, his, blood, one, altar, as, there, is, one, bishop, along, with, the, presbytery, and, deacons, my, fellow, servants, that, so, whatsoever, you, do, you, may, do, it, according, to, god, justin, martyr, born, c, 100, died, c, 165, mentions, in, this, regard, and, this, food, is, called, among, us, of, which, no, one, is, allowed, to, partake, but, the, man, who, believes, that, the, things, which, we, teach, are, true, and, who, has, been, washed, with, the, washing, that, is, for, the, remission, of, sins, and, unto, regeneration, and, who, is, so, living, as, christ, has, enjoined, for, not, as, common, bread, and, common, drink, do, we, receive, these, but, in, like, manner, as, jesus, christ, our, saviour, having, been, made, flesh, by, the, word, of, god, had, both, flesh, and, blood, for, our, salvation, so, likewise, have, we, been, taught, that, the, food, which, is, blessed, by, the, prayer, of, his, word, and, from, which, our, blood, and, flesh, by, transmutation, are, nourished, is, the, flesh, and, blood, of, that, jesus, who, was, made, flesh, paschasius, radbertus, 785, 865, was, a, carolingian, theologian, and, the, abbot, of, corbie, whose, best, known, and, influential, work, is, an, exposition, on, the, nature, of, the, eucharist, written, around, 831, entitled, de, corpore, et, sanguine, domini, in, it, paschasius, agrees, with, st, ambrose, in, affirming, that, the, eucharist, contains, the, true, historical, body, of, jesus, christ, according, to, paschasius, god, is, truth, itself, and, therefore, his, words, and, actions, must, be, true, christ, s, proclamation, at, the, last, supper, that, the, bread, and, wine, were, his, body, and, blood, must, be, taken, literally, since, god, is, truth, 9, he, thus, believes, that, the, transubstantiation, of, the, bread, and, wine, offered, in, the, eucharist, really, occurs, only, if, the, eucharist, is, the, actual, body, and, blood, of, christ, can, a, christian, know, it, is, salvific, 10, the, concept, of, the, jews, both, destroying, and, partaking, in, some, perverted, version, of, the, eucharist, has, been, a, vessel, to, promote, anti, judaism, and, anti, jewish, ideology, and, violence, in, medieval, times, jews, were, often, depicted, stabbing, or, in, some, other, way, physically, harming, communion, wafers, these, characterizations, drew, parallels, to, the, idea, that, the, jews, killed, christ, murdering, this, transubstantiation, or, host, was, thought, of, as, a, repetition, of, the, event, jewish, people, s, eagerness, to, destroy, hosts, were, also, a, variation, of, blood, libel, charges, with, jews, being, accused, of, murdering, bodies, of, christ, whether, they, be, communion, wafers, or, christian, children, the, blood, libel, charges, and, the, concept, of, eucharist, are, also, related, in, the, belief, that, blood, is, efficacious, meaning, it, has, some, sort, of, divine, power, most, christians, even, those, who, deny, that, there, is, any, real, change, in, the, elements, used, recognize, a, special, presence, of, christ, in, this, rite, however, christians, differ, about, exactly, how, where, and, how, long, christ, is, present, in, it, catholicism, eastern, orthodoxy, oriental, orthodoxy, and, the, church, of, the, east, teach, that, the, reality, the, substance, of, the, elements, of, bread, and, wine, is, wholly, changed, into, the, body, and, blood, of, jesus, christ, while, the, appearances, the, species, remain, transubstantiation, change, of, the, substance, is, the, term, used, by, catholics, to, denote, what, is, changed, not, to, explain, how, the, change, occurs, since, the, catholic, church, teaches, that, the, signs, of, bread, and, wine, become, in, a, way, surpassing, understanding, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, the, orthodox, use, various, terms, such, as, transelementation, but, no, explanation, is, official, as, they, prefer, to, leave, it, a, mystery, lutherans, believe, christ, to, be, truly, and, substantially, present, with, the, bread, and, wine, that, are, seen, in, the, eucharist, in, a, manner, referred, to, as, the, sacramental, union, they, attribute, the, real, presence, of, jesus, living, body, to, his, word, spoken, in, the, eucharist, and, not, to, the, faith, of, those, receiving, it, they, also, believe, that, forgiveness, of, sins, life, and, salvation, are, given, through, the, words, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, to, those, who, believe, his, words, given, and, shed, for, you, reformed, christians, also, believe, christ, to, be, present, in, the, eucharist, but, describe, this, presence, as, a, spiritual, presence, not, a, physical, one, anglicans, adhere, to, a, range, of, views, depending, on, churchmanship, although, the, teaching, in, the, anglican, thirty, nine, articles, holds, that, the, body, of, christ, is, received, by, the, faithful, only, in, a, heavenly, and, spiritual, manner, a, doctrine, also, taught, in, the, methodist, articles, of, religion, christians, adhering, to, the, theology, of, memorialism, such, as, the, anabaptist, churches, do, not, believe, in, the, concept, of, the, real, presence, believing, that, the, eucharist, is, only, a, ceremonial, remembrance, or, memorial, of, the, death, of, christ, the, baptism, eucharist, and, ministry, document, of, the, world, council, of, churches, attempting, to, present, the, common, understanding, of, the, eucharist, on, the, part, of, the, generality, of, christians, describes, it, as, essentially, the, sacrament, of, the, gift, which, god, makes, to, us, in, christ, through, the, power, of, the, holy, spirit, thanksgiving, to, the, father, anamnesis, or, memorial, of, christ, the, sacrament, of, the, unique, sacrifice, of, christ, who, ever, lives, to, make, intercession, for, us, the, sacrament, of, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, the, sacrament, of, his, real, presence, invocation, of, the, spirit, communion, of, the, faithful, and, meal, of, the, kingdom, many, christian, denominations, classify, the, eucharist, as, a, sacrament, some, protestants, though, not, all, prefer, to, instead, call, it, an, ordinance, viewing, it, not, as, a, specific, channel, of, divine, grace, but, as, an, expression, of, faith, and, of, obedience, to, christ, in, the, catholic, church, the, eucharist, is, considered, as, a, sacrament, according, to, the, church, the, eucharist, is, the, source, and, summit, of, the, christian, life, the, other, sacraments, and, indeed, all, ecclesiastical, ministries, and, works, of, the, apostolate, are, bound, up, with, the, eucharist, and, are, oriented, toward, it, for, in, the, blessed, eucharist, is, contained, the, whole, spiritual, good, of, the, church, namely, christ, himself, our, pasch, pasch, is, a, word, that, sometimes, means, easter, sometimes, passover, in, the, eucharist, the, same, sacrifice, that, jesus, made, only, once, on, the, cross, is, believed, to, be, made, present, at, every, mass, according, to, compendium, of, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, the, eucharist, is, the, very, sacrifice, of, the, body, and, blood, of, the, lord, jesus, which, he, instituted, to, perpetuate, the, sacrifice, of, the, cross, throughout, the, ages, until, his, return, in, glory, when, the, church, celebrates, the, eucharist, she, commemorates, christ, s, passover, and, it, is, made, present, the, sacrifice, christ, offered, once, for, all, on, the, cross, remains, ever, present, the, eucharist, is, thus, a, sacrifice, because, it, re, presents, makes, present, the, same, and, only, sacrifice, offered, once, for, all, on, the, cross, the, sacrifice, of, christ, and, the, sacrifice, of, the, eucharist, are, considered, as, one, single, sacrifice, the, victim, is, one, and, the, same, the, same, now, offers, through, the, ministry, of, priests, who, then, offered, himself, on, the, cross, only, the, manner, of, offering, is, different, in, the, holy, sacrifice, of, the, mass, it, is, christ, himself, the, eternal, high, priest, of, the, new, covenant, who, acting, through, the, ministry, of, the, priests, offers, the, eucharistic, sacrifice, and, it, is, the, same, christ, really, present, under, the, species, of, bread, and, wine, who, is, the, offering, of, the, eucharistic, sacrifice, according, to, the, catholic, church, jesus, christ, is, present, in, the, eucharist, in, a, true, real, and, substantial, way, with, his, body, blood, soul, and, divinity, by, the, consecration, the, substances, of, the, bread, and, wine, actually, become, the, substances, of, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, transubstantiation, while, the, appearances, or, species, of, the, bread, and, wine, remain, unaltered, e, g, colour, taste, feel, and, smell, this, change, is, brought, about, in, the, eucharistic, prayer, through, the, efficacy, of, the, word, of, christ, and, by, the, action, of, the, holy, spirit, the, eucharistic, presence, of, christ, begins, at, the, moment, of, the, consecration, and, endures, as, long, as, the, eucharistic, species, subsist, that, is, until, the, eucharist, is, digested, physically, destroyed, or, decays, by, some, natural, process, at, which, point, theologian, thomas, aquinas, argued, the, substance, of, the, bread, and, wine, cannot, return, the, fourth, council, of, the, lateran, in, 1215, spoke, of, the, bread, and, wine, as, transubstantiated, into, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, his, body, and, blood, are, truly, contained, in, the, sacrament, of, the, altar, under, the, forms, of, bread, and, wine, the, bread, and, wine, having, been, transubstantiated, by, god, s, power, into, his, body, and, blood, in, 1551, the, council, of, trent, definitively, declared, because, christ, our, redeemer, said, that, it, was, truly, his, body, that, he, was, offering, under, the, species, of, bread, it, has, always, been, the, conviction, of, the, church, of, god, and, this, holy, council, now, declares, again, that, by, the, consecration, of, the, bread, and, wine, there, takes, place, a, change, of, the, whole, substance, of, the, bread, into, the, substance, of, the, body, of, christ, and, of, the, whole, substance, of, the, wine, into, the, substance, of, his, blood, this, change, the, holy, catholic, church, has, fittingly, and, properly, called, transubstantiation, the, church, holds, that, the, body, and, blood, of, jesus, can, no, longer, be, truly, separated, where, one, is, the, other, must, be, therefore, although, the, priest, or, extraordinary, minister, of, holy, communion, says, the, body, of, christ, when, administering, the, host, and, the, blood, of, christ, when,

entire, in, each, of, their, parts, in, such, a, way, that, the, breaking, of, the, bread, does, not, divide, christ, the, catholic, church, sees, as, the, main, basis, for, this, belief, the, words, of, jesus, himself, at, his, last, supper, the, synoptic, gospels, and, paul, s, recount, that, jesus, at, the, time, of, taking, the, bread, and, the, cup, said, this, is, my, body, this, is, my, blood, the, catholic, understanding, of, these, words, from, the, patristic, authors, onward, has, emphasized, their, roots, in, the, covenantal, history, of, the, old, testament, the, interpretation, of, christ, s, words, against, this, old, testament, background, coheres, with, and, supports, belief, in, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, according, to, the, catholic, church, doctrine, receiving, the, eucharist, in, a, state, of, mortal, sin, is, a, sacrilege, and, only, those, who, are, in, a, state, of, grace, that, is, without, any, mortal, sin, can, receive, it, based, on, 1, corinthians, 11, 27, 29, it, affirms, the, following, anyone, who, is, aware, of, having, committed, a, mortal, sin, must, not, receive, holy, communion, even, if, he, experiences, deep, contrition, without, having, first, received, sacramental, absolution, unless, he, has, a, grave, reason, for, receiving, communion, and, there, is, no, possibility, of, going, to, confession, since, the, eucharist, is, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, the, worship, due, to, the, sacrament, of, the, eucharist, whether, during, the, celebration, of, the, mass, or, outside, it, is, the, worship, of, latria, that, is, the, adoration, given, to, god, alone, the, blessed, sacrament, can, be, exposed, displayed, on, an, altar, in, a, monstrance, rites, involving, the, exposure, of, the, blessed, sacrament, include, benediction, and, eucharistic, adoration, according, to, catholic, theology, the, host, after, the, rite, of, consecration, is, no, longer, bread, but, is, the, body, blood, soul, and, divinity, of, christ, catholics, believe, that, jesus, is, the, sacrificial, lamb, of, god, prefigured, in, the, old, testament, passover, the, flesh, of, that, passover, sacrificial, lamb, was, to, be, consumed, by, the, family, members, any, left, overs, were, to, be, burned, before, daybreak, so, that, none, of, the, passover, lamb, s, flesh, remained, it, is, to, be, noted, that, only, by, marking, the, doorposts, and, lintel, of, one, s, home, with, the, blood, of, the, lamb, were, the, members, of, the, household, saved, from, death, the, consumption, of, the, lamb, was, not, to, save, them, but, rather, to, give, them, energy, for, the, journey, of, escape, exodus, escape, from, slavery, in, egypt, as, was, also, true, for, the, unleavened, bread, exodus, 12, 3, 13, as, the,

eucharistic, service, is, called, the, divine, liturgy, byzantine, rite, or, similar, names, in, other, rites, it, comprises, two, main, divisions, the, first, is, the, liturgy, of, the, catechumens, which, consists, of, introductory, litanies, antiphons, and, scripture, readings, culminating, in, a, reading, from, one, of, the, gospels, and, often, a, homily, the, second, is, the, liturgy, of, the, faithful, in, which, the, eucharist, is, offered, consecrated, and, received, as, holy, communion, within, the, latter, the, actual, eucharistic, prayer, is, called, the, anaphora, literally, offering, or, carrying, up, from, the, greek, in, the, rite, of, constantinople, two, different, anaphoras, are, currently, used, one, is, attributed, to, john, chrysostom, the, other, to, basil, the, great, in, the, oriental, orthodox, church, a, variety, of, anaphoras, are, used, but, all, are, similar, in, structure, to, those, of, the, constantinopolitan, rite, in, which, the, anaphora, of, saint, john, chrysostom, is, used, most, days, of, the, year, saint, basil, s, is, offered, on, the, sundays, of, great, lent, the, eves, of, christmas, and, theophany, holy, thursday, holy, saturday, and, upon, his, feast, day, 1, january, at, the, conclusion, of, the, anaphora, the, bread, and, wine, are, held, to, be, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, unlike, the, latin, church, the, byzantine, rite, uses, leavened, bread, with, the, leaven, symbolizing, the, presence, of, the, holy, spirit, the, greek, orthodox, church, utilizes, leavened, bread, in, their, celebration, conventionally, this, change, in, the, elements, is, understood, to, be, accomplished, at, the, epiclesis, invocation, by, which, the, holy, spirit, is, invoked, and, the, consecration, of, the, bread, and, wine, as, the, genuine, body, and, blood, of, christ, is, specifically, requested, but, since, the, anaphora, as, a, whole, is, considered, a, unitary, albeit, lengthy, prayer, no, one, moment, within, it, can, readily, be, singled, out, anabaptist, denominations, such, as, the, mennonites, and, german, baptist, brethren, churches, like, the, church, of, the, brethren, churches, and, congregations, have, the, agape, feast, footwashing, as, well, as, the, serving, of, the, bread, and, wine, in, the, celebration, of, the, lovefeast, in, the, more, modern, groups, communion, is, only, the, serving, of, the, lord, s, supper, in, the, communion, meal, the, members, of, the, mennonite, churches, renew, their, covenant, with, god, and, with, each, other, the, moravian, church, adheres, to, a, view, known, as, the, sacramental, presence, teaching, that, in, the, sacrament, of, holy, communion, christ, gives, his, body, and, blood, according, to, his, promise, to, all, who, partake, of, the, elements, when, we, eat, and, drink, the, bread, and, the, wine, of, the, supper, with, expectant, faith, we, thereby, have, communion, with, the, body, and, blood, of, our, lord, and, receive, the, forgiveness, of, sins, life, and, salvation, in, this, sense, the, bread, and, wine, are, rightly, said, to, be, christ, s, body, and, blood, which, he, gives, to, his, disciples, nicolaus, zinzendorf, a, bishop, of, the, moravian, church, stated, that, holy, communion, is, the, most, intimate, of, all, connection, with, the, person, of, the, saviour, the, order, of, service, for, the, observance, of, the, lord, s, supper, includes, a, salutation, hymns, the, right, hand, of, fellowship, prayer, consecration, of, the, elements, distribution, of, the, elements, partaking, of, the, elements, and, a, benediction, moravian, christians, traditionally, practice, footwashing, before, partaking, in, the, lord, s, supper, although, in, certain, moravian, congregations, this, rite, is, observed, chiefly, on, maundy, thursday, anglican, theology, on, the, matter, of, the, eucharist, is, nuanced, the, eucharist, is, neither, wholly, a, matter, of, transubstantiation, nor, simply, devotional, and, memorialist, in, orientation, the, anglican, churches, do, not, adhere, to, the, belief, that, the, lord, s, supper, is, merely, a, devotional, reflection, on, christ, s, death, for, some, anglicans, christ, is, spiritually, present, in, the, fullness, of, his, person, in, the, eucharist, the, church, of, england, itself, has, repeatedly, refused, to, make, official, any, definition, of, the, presence, of, christ, church, authorities, prefer, to, leave, it, a, mystery, while, proclaiming, the, consecrated, bread, and, wine, to, be, spiritual, food, of, christ, s, most, precious, body, and, blood, the, bread, and, wine, are, an, outward, sign, of, an, inner, grace, 859, the, words, of, administration, at, communion, allow, for, real, presence, or, for, a, real, but, spiritual, presence, calvinist, receptionism, and, virtualism, this, concept, was, congenial, to, most, anglicans, well, into, the, 19th, century, from, the, 1840s, the, tractarians, reintroduced, the, idea, of, the, real, presence, to, suggest, a, corporeal, presence, which, could, be, done, since, the, language, of, the, bcp, rite, referred, to, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, without, details, as, well, as, referring, to, these, as, spiritual, food, at, other, places, in, the, text, both, are, found, in, the, latin, and, other, rites, but, in, the, former, a, definite, interpretation, as, corporeal, is, applied, both, receptionism, and, virtualism, assert, the, real, presence, the, former, places, emphasis, on, the, recipient, and, the, latter, states, the, presence, is, confected, by, the, power, of, the, holy, spirit, but, not, in, christ, s, natural, body, his, presence, is, objective, and, does, not, depend, on, its, existence, from, the, faith, of, the, recipient, the, liturgy, petitions, that, elements, be, rather, than, become, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, leaving, aside, any, theory, of, a, change, in, the, natural, elements, bread, and, wine, are, the, outer, reality, and, the, presence, is, the, inner, invisible, except, as, perceived, in, faith, 314, 324, in, 1789, the, episcopal, church, in, the, united, states, restored, explicit, language, that, the, eucharist, is, an, oblation, sacrifice, to, god, subsequent, revisions, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, by, member, churches, of, the, anglican, communion, have, done, likewise, the, church, of, england, did, so, in, the, proposed, 1928, prayer, book, 318, 324, the, so, called, black, rubric, in, the, 1552, prayer, book, which, allowed, kneeling, when, receiving, holy, communion, was, omitted, in, the, 1559, edition, at, queen, elizabeth, i, s, insistence, it, was, reinstated, in, the, 1662, prayer, book, modified, to, deny, any, corporal, presence, of, christ, s, natural, flesh, and, blood, which, are, in, heaven, and, not, here, the, bread, and, fruit, of, the, vine, indicated, in, matthew, mark, and, luke, as, the, elements, of, the, lord, s, supper, are, interpreted, by, many, baptists, as, unleavened, bread, although, leavened, bread, is, often, used, and, in, line, with, the, historical, stance, of, some, baptist, groups, since, the, mid, 19th, century, against, partaking, of, alcoholic, beverages, grape, juice, which, they, commonly, refer, to, simply, as, the, cup, the, unleavened, bread, also, underscores, the, symbolic, belief, attributed, to, christ, s, breaking, the, bread, and, saying, that, it, was, his, body, a, soda, cracker, is, often, used, some, baptists, consider, the, communion, to, be, primarily, an, act, of, remembrance, of, christ, s, atonement, and, a, time, of, renewal, of, personal, commitment, memorialism, such, as, free, will, baptists, while, others, such, as, particular, baptists, affirm, the, reformed, doctrine, of, a, pneumatic, presence, which, is, expressed, in, the, second, london, baptist, confession, specifically, in, chapter, 30, articles, 3, and, 7, this, view, is, prevalent, among, southern, baptists, those, in, the, founders, movement, a, calvinistic, movement, among, some, independent, baptists, and, several, individuals, in, other, baptist, associations, communion, practices, and, frequency, vary, among, congregations, a, typical, practice, is, to, have, small, cups, of, juice, and, plates, of, broken, bread, distributed, to, the, seated, congregation, in, other, congregations, communicants, may, proceed, to, the, altar, to, receive, the, elements, then, return, to, their, seats, a, widely, accepted, practice, is, for, all, to, receive, and, hold, the, elements, until, everyone, is, served, then, consume, the, bread, and, cup, in, unison, usually, music, is, performed, and, scripture, such, as, the, precise, verses, of, jesus, speaking, at, the, last, supper, is, read, during, the, receiving, of, the, elements, some, baptist, churches, are, closed, communionists, even, requiring, full, membership, in, the, local, church, congregation, before, partaking, with, others, being, partially, or, fully, open, communionists, it, is, rare, to, find, a, baptist, church, where, the, lord, s, supper, is, observed, every, sunday, most, observe, monthly, or, quarterly, with, some, holding, communion, only, during, a, designated, communion, service, or, following, a, worship, service, adults, and, children, in, attendance, who, have, not, made, a, profession, of, faith, in, christ, are, expected, to, not, participate, lutherans, believe, that, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, are, truly, and, substantially, present, in, with, and, under, the, forms, of, the, consecrated, bread, and, wine, the, elements, so, that, communicants, eat, and, drink, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, himself, as, well, as, the, bread, and, wine, in, the, eucharistic, sacrament, the, lutheran, doctrine, of, the, real, presence, is, more, accurately, and, formally, known, as, the, sacramental, union, others, have, erroneously, called, this, consubstantiation, a, lollardist, doctrine, though, this, term, is, specifically, rejected, by, lutheran, churches, and, theologians, since, it, creates, confusion, about, the, actual, doctrine, and, subjects, the, doctrine, to, the, control, of, a, non, biblical, philosophical, concept, in, the, same, manner, as, in, their, view, does, the, term, transubstantiation, while, an, official, movement, exists, in, lutheran, congregations, to, celebrate, eucharist, weekly, using, formal, rites, very, similar, to, the, catholic, and, high, anglican, services, it, was, historically, common, for, congregations, to, celebrate, monthly, or, even, quarterly, even, in, congregations, where, eucharist, is, offered, weekly, there, is, not, a, requirement, that, every, church, service, be, a, eucharistic, service, nor, that, all, members, of, a, congregation, must, receive, it, weekly, among, open, assemblies, also, termed, plymouth, brethren, the, eucharist, is, more, commonly, called, the, breaking, of, bread, or, the, lord, s, supper, they, believe, it, is, only, a, symbolic, reenactment, of, the, last, supper, and, a, memorial, and, is, central, to, the, worship, of, both, individual, and, assembly, 375, in, principle, the, service, is, open, to, all, baptized, christians, but, an, individual, s, eligibility, to, participate, depends, on, the, views, of, each, particular, assembly, the, service, takes, the, form, of, non, liturgical, open, worship, with, all, male, participants, allowed, to, pray, audibly, and, select, hymns, or, readings, the, breaking, of, bread, itself, typically, consists, of, one, leavened, loaf, which, is, prayed, over, and, broken, by, a, participant, in, the, meeting, 279, 281, and, then, shared, around, the, wine, is, poured, from, a, single, container, into, one, or, several, vessels, and, these, are, again, shared, around, 375, the, exclusive, brethren, follow, a, similar, practice, to, the, open, brethren, they, also, call, the, eucharist, the, breaking, of, bread, or, the, lord, s, supper, in, the, reformed, tradition, which, includes, the, continental, reformed, churches, the, presbyterian, churches, and, the, congregationalist, churches, the, eucharist, is, variously, administered, the, calvinist, view, of, the, sacrament, sees, a, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, supper, which, differs, both, from, the, objective, ontological, presence, of, the, catholic, view, and, from, the, real, absence, of, christ, and, the, mental, recollection, of, the, memorialism, of, the, zwinglians, 189, and, their, successors, the, bread, and, wine, become, the, means, by, which, the, believer, has, real, communion, with, christ, in, his, death, and, christ, s, body, and, blood, are, present, to, the, faith, of, the, believer, as, really, as, the, bread, and, wine, are, present, to, their, senses, but, this, presence, is, spiritual, that, is, the, work, of, the, holy, spirit, there, is, no, standard, frequency, john, calvin, desired, weekly, communion, but, the, city, council, only, approved, monthly, and, monthly, celebration, has, become, the, most, common, practice, in, reformed, churches, today, many, on, the, other, hand, follow, john, knox, in, celebration, of, the, lord, s, supper, on, a, quarterly, basis, to, give, proper, time, for, reflection, and, inward, consideration, of, one, s, own, state, and, sin, recently, presbyterian, and, reformed, churches, have, been, considering, whether, to, restore, more, frequent, communion, including, weekly, communion, in, more, churches, considering, that, infrequent, communion, was, derived, from, a, memorialist, view, of, the, lord, s, supper, rather, than, calvin, s, view, of, the, sacrament, as, a, means, of, grace, some, churches, use, bread, without, any, raising, agent, whether, yeast, or, another, leaven, in, view, of, the, use, of, unleavened, bread, at, jewish, passover, meals, while, others, use, any, bread, available, the, presbyterian, church, usa, for, instance, prescribes, bread, common, to, the, culture, harking, back, to, the, regulative, principle, of, worship, the, reformed, tradition, had, long, eschewed, coming, forward, to, receive, communion, preferring, to, have, the, elements, distributed, throughout, the, congregation, by, the, presbyters, elders, more, in, the, style, of, a, shared, meal, over, the, last, half, a, century, it, is, much, more, common, in, presbyterian, churches, to, have, holy, communion, monthly, or, on, a, weekly, basis, it, is, also, becoming, common, to, receive, the, elements, by, intinction, receiving, a, piece, of, consecrated, bread, or, wafer, dipping, it, in, the, blessed, wine, and, consuming, it, wine, and, grape, juice, are, both, used, depending, on, the, congregation, most, reformed, churches, practice, open, communion, i, e, all, believers, who, are, united, to, a, church, of, like, faith, and, practice, and, who, are, not, living, in, sin, would, be, allowed, to, join, in, the, sacrament, the, british, catechism, for, the, use, of, the, people, called, methodists, states, that, jesus, christ, is, present, with, his, worshipping, people, and, gives, himself, to, them, as, their, lord, and, saviour, methodist, theology, of, this, sacrament, is, reflected, in, one, of, the, fathers, of, the, movement, charles, wesley, who, wrote, a, eucharistic, hymn, with, the, following, stanza, we, need, not, now, go, up, to, heaven, to, bring, the, long, sought, saviour, down, thou, art, to, all, already, given, thou, dost, e, en, now, thy, banquet, crown, to, every, faithful, soul, appear, and, show, thy, real, presence, here, reflecting, wesleyan, covenant, theology, methodists, also, believe, that, the, lord, s, supper, is, a, sign, and, seal, of, the, covenant, of, grace, in, many, methodist, denominations, non, alcoholic, wine, grape, juice, is, used, so, as, to, include, those, who, do, not, take, alcohol, for, any, reason, as, well, as, a, commitment, to, the, church, s, historical, support, of, temperance, variations, of, the, eucharistic, prayer, are, provided, for, various, occasions, including, communion, of, the, sick, and, brief, forms, for, occasions, that, call, for, greater, brevity, though, the, ritual, is, standardized, there, is, great, variation, amongst, methodist, churches, from, typically, high, church, to, low, church, in, the, enactment, and, style, of, celebration, methodist, clergy, are, not, required, to, be, vested, when, celebrating, the, eucharist, john, wesley, a, founder, of, methodism, said, that, it, was, the, duty, of, christians, to, receive, the, sacrament, as, often, as, possible, methodists, in, the, united, states, are, encouraged, to, celebrate, the, eucharist, every, sunday, though, it, is, typically, celebrated, on, the, first, sunday, of, each, month, while, a, few, go, as, long, as, celebrating, quarterly, a, tradition, dating, back, to, the, days, of, circuit, riders, that, served, multiple, churches, communicants, may, receive, standing, kneeling, or, while, seated, gaining, more, wide, acceptance, is, the, practice, of, receiving, by, intinction, receiving, a, piece, of, consecrated, bread, or, wafer, dipping, it, in, the, blessed, wine, and, consuming, it, the, most, common, alternative, to, intinction, is, for, the, communicants, to, receive, the, consecrated, juice, using, small, individual, specially, made, glass, or, plastic, cups, known, as, communion, cups, the, united, methodist, church, practices, open, communion, which, it, describes, as, an, open, table, inviting, all, who, intend, a, christian, life, together, with, their, children, to, receive, the, eucharistic, elements, the, doctrines, and, discipline, of, the, methodist, church, specifies, on, days, during, which, holy, communion, is, celebrated, that, upon, entering, the, church, let, the, communicants, bow, in, prayer, and, in, the, spirit, of, prayer, and, meditation, approach, the, blessed, sacrament, many, non, denominational, christians, including, the, churches, of, christ, receive, communion, every, sunday, others, including, evangelical, churches, such, as, the, church, of, god, and, calvary, chapel, typically, receive, communion, on, a, monthly, or, periodic, basis, many, non, denominational, christians, hold, to, the, biblical, autonomy, of, local, churches, and, have, no, universal, requirement, among, congregations, some, churches, of, christ, among, others, use, grape, juice, and, unleavened, wafers, or,

church, taught, the, real, presence, of, christ, in, the, eucharist, emphasizing, the, humiliated, humanity, of, christ, in, the, lord, s, supper, additionally, the, irvingian, churches, affirm, the, real, presence, of, the, sacrifice, of, jesus, christ, in, holy, communion, jesus, christ, is, in, the, midst, of, the, congregation, as, the, crucified, risen, and, returning, lord, thus, his, once,

bread, and, water, the, sacrament, is, passed, row, by, row, to, the, congregation, by, priesthood, holders, typically, deacons, the, prayer, recited, for, the, bread, and, the, water, is, found, in, the, book, of, mormon, and, doctrine, and, covenants, the, prayer, contains, the, above, essentials, given, by, jesus, always, remember, him, and, keep, his, commandments, that, they, may, always,

grace, through, this, sacrament, it, does, not, practice, the, sacraments, of, communion, or, baptism, this, is, because, they, believe, that, these, are, unnecessary, for, the, living, of, a, christian, life, and, because, in, the, opinion, of, salvation, army, founders, william, and, catherine, booth, the, sacrament, placed, too, much, stress, on, outward, ritual, and, too, little, on, inward, spiritual, conversion, emphasizing, the, inward, spiritual, experience, of, their, adherents, over, any, outward, ritual, quakers, members, of, the, religious, society, of, friends, generally, do, not, baptize, or, observe, communion, although, the, early, church, of, christ, scientist, observed, communion, founder, mary, baker, eddy, eventually, discouraged, the, physical, ritual, as, she, believed, it, distracted, from, the, true, spiritual, nature, of, the, sacrament, as, such, christian, scientists, do, not, observe, physical, communion, with, bread, and, wine, but, spiritual, communion, at, two, special, sunday, services, each, year, by, uniting, together, with, christ, in, silent, prayer, and, on, bended, knee, the, united, society, of, believers, commonly, known, as, shakers, do, not, take, communion, instead, viewing, every, meal, as, a, eucharistic, feast, christian, denominations, differ, in, their, understanding, of, whether, they, may, celebrate, the, eucharist, with, those, with, whom, they, are, not, in, full, communion, the, apologist, justin, martyr, c, 150, wrote, of, the, eucharist, of, which, no, one, is, allowed, to, partake, but, the, man, who, believes, that, we, teach, are, true, and, who, has, been, washed, with, the, washing, that, is, for, the, remission, of, sins, and, unto, regeneration, and, who, is, so, living, as, christ, has, enjoined, this, was, continued, in, the, practice, of, dismissing, the, catechumens, those, still, undergoing, instruction, and, not, yet, baptized, before, the, sacramental, part, of, the, liturgy, a, custom, which, has, left, traces, in, the, expression, mass, of, the, catechumens, and, in, the, byzantine, rite, exclamation, by, the, deacon, or, priest, the, doors, the, doors, just, before, recitation, of, the, creed, churches, such, as, the, catholic, and, the, eastern, orthodox, churches, practice, closed, communion, under, normal, circumstances, however, the, catholic, church, allows, administration, of, the, eucharist, at, their, spontaneous, request, to, properly, disposed, members, of, the, eastern, churches, eastern, orthodox, oriental, orthodox, and, church, of, the, east, not, in, full, communion, with, it, and, of, other, churches, that, the, holy, see, judges, to, be, sacramentally, in, the, same, position, as, these, churches, and, in, grave, and, pressing, need, such, as, danger, of, death, it, allows, the, eucharist, to, be, administered, also, to, individuals, who, do, not, belong, to, these, churches, but, who, share, the, catholic, church, s, faith, in, the, reality, of, the, eucharist, and, have, no, access, to, a, minister, of, their, own, community, some, protestant, communities, exclude, non, members, from, communion, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, elca, practices, open, communion, provided, those, who, receive, are, baptized, but, the, lutheran, church, missouri, synod, and, the, wisconsin, evangelical, lutheran, synod,

restriction, to, members, of, the, same, denomination, and, closed, communion, for, restriction, to, members, of, the, local, congregation, alone, most, protestant, communities, including, congregational, churches, the, church, of, the, nazarene, the, assemblies, of, god, methodists, most, presbyterians, and, baptists, anglicans, and, churches, of, christ, and, other, non, denominational, churches, practice, various, forms, of, open, communion, some, churches, do, not, limit, it, to, only, members, of, the, congregation, but, to, any, people, in, attendance, regardless, of, christian, affiliation, who, consider, themselves, to, be, christian, others, require, that, the, communicant, be, a, baptized, person, or, a, member, of, a, church, of, that, denomination, or, a, denomination, of, like, faith, and, practice, some, progressive, christian, congregations, offer, communion, to, any, individual, who, wishes, to, commemorate, the, life, and, teachings, of, christ, regardless, of, religious, affiliation, most, latter, day, saint, churches, practice, closed, communion, one, notable, exception, is, the, community, of, christ, the, second, largest, denomination, in, this, movement, while, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, the, largest, of, the, lds, denominations, technically, practice, a, closed, communion, their, official, direction, to, local, church, leaders, in, handbook, 2, section, 20, 4, 1, last, paragraph, is, as, follows, although, the, sacrament, is, for, church, members, the, bishopric, should, not, announce, that, it, will, be, passed, to, members, only, and, nothing, should, be, done, to, prevent, nonmembers, from, partaking, of, it, in, the, malankara, orthodox, syrian, church, the, eucharist, is, only, given, to, those, who, have, come, prepared, to, receive, the, life, giving, body, and, blood, therefore, in, a, manner, to, worthily, receive, believers, fast, the, night, before, the, liturgy, from, around, 6pm, or, the, conclusion, of, evening, prayer, and, remain, fasting, until, they, receive, holy, qurbana, the, next, morning, additionally, members, who, plan, to, receive, the, holy, communion, have, to, follow, a, strict, guide, of, prescribed, prayers, from, the, shehimo, or, the, book, of, common, prayers, for, the, week, the, catholic, church, requires, its, members, to, receive, the, sacrament, of, penance, or, reconciliation, before, taking, communion, if, they, are, aware, of, having, committed, a, mortal, sin, and, to, prepare, by, fasting, prayer, and, other, works, of, piety, traditionally, the, eastern, orthodox, church, has, required, its, members, to, have, observed, all, church, appointed, fasts, most, weeks, this, will, be, at, least, wednesday, and, friday, for, the, week, prior, to, partaking, of, communion, and, to, fast, from, all, food, and, water, from, midnight, the, night, before, in, addition, orthodox, christians, are, to, have, made, a, recent, confession, to, their, priest, the, frequency, varying, with, one, s, particular, priest, and, they, must, be, at, peace, with, all, others, meaning, that, they, hold, no, grudges, or, anger, against, anyone, in, addition, one, is, expected, to, attend, vespers, or, the, all, night, vigil, if, offered, on, the, night, before, receiving, communion, furthermore, various, pre, communion, prayers, have, been, composed, which, many, but, not, all, orthodox, churches, require, or, at, least, strongly, encourage, members, to, say, privately, before, coming, to, the, eucharist, however, all, this, will, typically, vary, from, priest, to, priest, and, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, but, abstaining, from, food, and, water, for, several, hours, beforehand, is, a, fairly, universal, rule, many, protestant, congregations, generally, reserve, a, period, of, time, for, self, examination, and, private, silent, confession, just, before, partaking, in, the, lord, s, supper, eucharistic, adoration, is, a, practice, in, the, latin, church, anglo, catholic, and, some, lutheran, traditions, in, which, the, blessed, sacrament, is, exposed, to, and, adored, by, the, faithful, when, this, exposure, and, adoration, is, constant, twenty, four, hours, a, day, it, is, called, perpetual, adoration, in, a, parish, this, is, usually, done, by, volunteer, parishioners, in, a, monastery, or, convent, it, is, done, by, the, resident, monks, or, nuns, in, the, exposition, of, the, blessed, sacrament, the, eucharist, is, displayed, in, a, monstrance, typically, placed, on, an, altar, at, times, with, a, light, focused, on, it, or, with, candles, flanking, it, the, gluten, in, wheat, bread, is, dangerous, to, people, with, celiac, disease, and, other, gluten, related, disorders, such, as, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, and, wheat, allergy, for, the, catholic, church, this, issue, was, addressed, in, the, 24, july, 2003, letter, of, the, congregation, for, the, doctrine, of, the, faith, which, summarized, and, clarified, earlier, declarations, the, catholic, church, believes, that, the, matter, for, the, eucharist, must, be, wheaten, bread, and, fermented, wine, from, grapes, it, holds, that, if, the, gluten, has, been, entirely, removed, the, result, is, not, true, wheaten, bread, for, celiacs, but, not, generally, it, allows, low, gluten, bread, it, also, permits, holy, communion, to, be, received, under, the, form, of, either, bread, or, wine, alone, except, by, a, priest, who, is, celebrating, mass, without, other, priests, or, as, principal, celebrant, many, protestant, churches, offer, communicants, gluten, free, alternatives, to, wheaten, bread, usually, in, the, form, of, a, rice, based, or, other, gluten, free, wafer, the, catholic, church, believes, that, grape, juice, that, has, not, begun, even, minimally, to, ferment, cannot, be, accepted, as, wine, which, it, sees, as, essential, for, celebration, of, the, eucharist, for, non, alcoholics, but, not, generally, it, allows, the, use, of, mustum, grape, juice, in, which, fermentation, has, begun, but, has, been, suspended, without, altering, the, nature, of, the, juice, and, it, holds, that, since, christ, is, sacramentally, present, under, each, of, the, species, communion, under, the, species, of, bread, alone, makes, it, possible, to, receive, all, the, fruit, of, eucharistic, grace, for, pastoral, reasons, this, manner, of, receiving, communion, has, been, legitimately, established, as, the, most, common, form, in, the, latin, rite, as, already, indicated, the, one, exception, is, in, the, case, of, a, priest, celebrating, mass, without, other, priests, or, as, principal, celebrant, the, water, that, in, the, roman, rite, is, prescribed, to, be, mixed, with, the, wine, must, be, only, a, relatively, small, quantity, the, practice, of, the, coptic, church, is, that, the, mixture, should, be, two, parts, wine, to, one, part, water, some, protestant, churches, allow, communion, in, a, non, alcoholic, form, either, normatively, or, as, a, pastoral, exception, since, the, invention, of, the, necessary, technology, grape, juice, which, has, been, pasteurized, to, stop, the, fermentation, process, the, juice, naturally, undergoes, and, de, alcoholized, wine, from, which, most, of, the, alcohol, has, been, removed, between, 0, 5, and, 2, remains, are, commonly, used, and, more, rarely, water, may, be, offered, exclusive, use, of, unfermented, grape, juice, is, common, in, baptist, churches, the, united, methodist, church, seventh, day, adventists, christian, churches, churches, of, christ, churches, of, christ, church, of, god, anderson, indiana, some, lutherans, assemblies, of, god, pentecostals, evangelicals, the, christian, missionary, alliance, and, other, american, independent, protestant, churches, risk, of, infectious, disease, transmission, related, to, use, of, a, common, communion, cup, exists, but, it, is, low, no, case, of, transmission, of, an, infectious, disease, related, to, a, common, communion, cup, has, ever, been, documented, experimental, studies, have, demonstrated, that, infectious, diseases, can, be, transmitted, the, most, likely, diseases, to, be, transmitted, would, be, common, viral, illnesses, such, as, the, common, cold, a, study, of, 681, individuals, found, that, taking, communion, up, to, daily, from, a, common, cup, did, not, increase, the, risk, of, infection, beyond, that, of, those, who, did, not, attend, services, at, all, in, influenza, epidemics, some, churches, suspend, the, giving, wine, at, communion, for, fear, of, spreading, the, disease, this, is, in, full, accord, with, catholic, church, belief, that, communion, under, the, form, of, bread, alone, makes, it, possible, to, receive, all, the, fruit, of, eucharistic, grace, however, the, same, measure, has, also, been, taken, by, churches, that, normally, insist, on, the, importance, of, receiving, communion, under, both, forms, this, was, done, in, 2009, by, the, church, of, england, some, fear, contagion, through, the, handling, involved, in, distributing, the, hosts, to, the, communicants, even, if, they, are, placed, on, the, hand, rather, than, on, the, tongue, accordingly, some, churches, use, mechanical, wafer, dispensers, or, pillow, packs, communion, wafers, with, wine, inside, them, while, these, methods, of, distributing, communion, are, not, generally, accepted, in, catholic, parishes, one, parish, provides, a, mechanical, dispenser, to, allow, those, intending, to, commune, to, place, in, a, bowl, without, touching, them, by, hand, the, hosts, for, use, in, the, celebration
