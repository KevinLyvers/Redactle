political, philosophy, or, political, theory, is, the, philosophical, study, of, government, addressing, questions, about, the, nature, scope, and, legitimacy, of, public, agents, and, institutions, and, the, relationships, between, them, its, topics, include, politics, justice, liberty, property, rights, law, and, the, enforcement, of, laws, by, authority, what, they, are, if, they, are, needed, what, makes, a, government, legitimate, what, rights, and, freedoms, it, should, protect, what, form, it, should, take, what, the, law, is, and, what, duties, citizens, owe, to, a, legitimate, government, if, any, and, when, it, may, be, legitimately, overthrown, if, ever, political, theory, also, engages, questions, of, a, broader, scope, tackling, the, political, nature, of, phenomena, and, categories, such, as, identity, culture, sexuality, race, wealth, human, nonhuman, relations, ethics, religion, and, more, political, science, the, scientific, study, of, politics, is, generally, used, in, the, singular, but, in, french, and, spanish, the, plural, sciences, politiques, and, ciencias, pol, ticas, respectively, is, used, perhaps, a, reflection, of, the, discipline, s, eclectic, nature, political, philosophy, is, a, branch, of, philosophy, but, it, has, also, played, a, major, part, in, political, science, within, which, a, strong, focus, has, historically, been, placed, on, both, the, history, of, political, thought, and, contemporary, political, theory, from, normative, political, theory, to, various, critical, approaches, in, the, oxford, handbook, of, political, theory, 2009, the, field, is, described, as, an, interdisciplinary, endeavor, whose, center, of, gravity, lies, at, the, humanities, end, of, the, happily, still, undisciplined, discipline, of, political, science, for, a, long, time, the, challenge, for, the, identity, of, political, theory, has, been, how, to, position, itself, productively, in, three, sorts, of, location, in, relation, to, the, academic, disciplines, of, political, science, history, and, philosophy, between, the, world, of, politics, and, the, more, abstract, ruminative, register, of, theory, between, canonical, political, theory, and, the, newer, resources, such, as, feminist, and, critical, theory, discourse, analysis, film, and, film, theory, popular, and, political, culture, mass, media, studies, neuroscience, environmental, studies, behavioral, science, and, economics, on, which, political, theorists, increasingly, draw, indian, political, philosophy, in, ancient, times, demarcated, a, clear, distinction, between, 1, nation, and, state, 2, religion, and, state, the, constitutions, of, hindu, states, evolved, over, time, and, were, based, on, political, and, legal, treatises, and, prevalent, social, institutions, the, institutions, of, state, were, broadly, divided, into, governance, diplomacy, administration, defense, law, and, order, mantranga, the, principal, governing, body, of, these, states, consisted, of, the, king, prime, minister, commander, in, chief, of, army, chief, priest, of, the, king, the, prime, minister, headed, the, committee, of, ministers, along,

bruhaspati, ushanas, prachetasa, manu, parasara, and, ambi, and, described, himself, as, a, descendant, of, a, lineage, of, political, philosophers, with, his, father, chanaka, being, his, immediate, predecessor, another, influential, extant, indian, treatise, on, political, philosophy, is, the, sukra, neeti, an, example, of, a, code, of, law, in, ancient, india, is, the, manusm, ti, or, laws, of, manu, chinese, political, philosophy, dates, back, to, the, spring, and, autumn, period, specifically, with, confucius, in, the, 6th, century, bc, chinese, political, philosophy, was, developed, as, a, response, to, the, social, and, political, breakdown, of, the, country, characteristic, of, the, spring, and, autumn, period, and, the, warring, states, period, the, major, philosophies, during, the, period, confucianism, legalism, mohism, agrarianism, and, taoism, each, had, a, political, aspect, to, their, philosophical, schools, philosophers, such, as, confucius, mencius, and, mozi, focused, on, political, unity, and, political, stability, as, the, basis, of, their, political, philosophies, confucianism, advocated, a, hierarchical, meritocratic, government, based, on, empathy,

prior, to, china, s, adoption, of, communism, state, confucianism, remained, the, dominant, political, philosophy, of, china, up, to, the, 20th, century, western, political, philosophy, originates, in, the, philosophy, of, ancient, greece, where, political, philosophy, dates, back, to, at, least, plato, ancient, greece, was, dominated, by, city, states, which, experimented, with, various, forms, of, political, organization, plato, grouped, forms, of, government, into, five, categories, of, descending, stability, and, morality, republic, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and, tyranny, one, of, the, first, extremely, important, classical, works, of, political, philosophy, is, plato, s, republic, which, was, followed, by, aristotle, s, nicomachean, ethics, and, politics, roman, political, philosophy, was, influenced, by, the, stoics, and, the, roman, statesman, cicero, the, early, christian, philosophy, of, augustine, of, hippo, was, heavily, influenced, by, plato, a, key, change, brought, about, by, christian, thought, was, the, moderation, of, the, stoicism, and, theory, of, justice, of, the, roman, world, as, well, emphasis, on, the, role, of, the, state, in, applying, mercy, as, a, moral, example, augustine, also, preached, that, one, was, not, a, member, of, his, or, her, city, but, was, either, a, citizen, of, the, city, of, god, civitas, dei, or, the, earthly, city, civitas, terrena, augustine, s, city, of, god, is, an, influential, work, of, this, period, that, attacked, the, thesis, held, by, many, christian, romans, that, the, christian, view, could, be, realized, on, earth, thomas, aquinas, meticulously, dealt, with, the, varieties, of, philosophy, of, law, according, to, aquinas, there, are, four, kinds, of, law, aquinas, never, discusses, the, nature, or, categorization, of, canon, law, there, is, scholarly, debate, surrounding, the, place, of, canon, law, within, the, thomistic, jurisprudential, framework, aquinas, was, an, incredibly, influential, thinker, in, the, natural, law, tradition, the, rise, of, islam, based, on, both, the, qur, an, and, muhammad, strongly, altered, the, power, balances, and, perceptions, of, origin, of, power, in, the, mediterranean, region, early, islamic, philosophy, emphasized, an, inexorable, link, between, science, and, religion, and, the, process, of, ijtihad, to, find, truth, in, effect, all, philosophy, was, political, as, it, had, real, implications, for, governance, this, view, was, challenged, by, the, rationalist, mutazilite, philosophers, who, held, a, more, hellenic, view, reason, above, revelation, and, as, such, are, known, to, modern, scholars, as, the, first, speculative, theologians, of, islam, they, were, supported, by, a, secular, aristocracy, who, sought, freedom, of, action, independent, of, the, caliphate, by, the, late, ancient, period, however, the, traditionalist, asharite, view, of, islam, had, in, general, triumphed, according, to, the, asharites, reason, must, be, subordinate, to, the, quran, and, the, sunna, islamic, political, philosophy, was, indeed, rooted, in, the, very, sources, of, islam, i, e, the, qur, an, and, the, sunnah, the, words, and, practices, of, muhammad, thus, making, it, essentially, theocratic, however, in, western, thought, it, is, generally, supposed, that, it, was, a, specific, area, peculiar, merely, to, the, great, philosophers, of, islam, al, kindi, alkindus, al, farabi, abunaser, bn, sina, avicenna, ibn, bajjah, avempace, and, ibn, rushd, averroes, the, political, conceptions, of, islam, such, as, kudrah, power, sultan, ummah, cemaa, obligation, and, even, the, core, terms, of, the, qur, an, i, e, ibadah, worship, din, religion, rab, master, and, ilah, deity, is, taken, as, the, basis, of, an, analysis, hence, not, only, the, ideas, of, the, muslim, political, philosophers, but, also, many, other, jurists, and, ulama, posed, political, ideas, and, theories, for, example, the, ideas, of, the, khawarij, in, the, very, early, years, of, islamic, history, on, khilafa, and, ummah, or, that, of, shia, islam, on, the, concept, of, imamah, are, considered, proofs, of, political, thought, the, clashes, between, the, ehl, i, sunna, and, shia, in, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, had, a, genuine, political, character, political, thought, was, not, purely, rooted, in, theism, however, aristotleanism, flourished, as, the, islamic, golden, age, saw, rise, to, a, continuation, of, the, peripatetic, philosophers, who, implemented, the, ideas, of, aristotle, in, the, context, of, the, islamic, world, abunaser, avicenna, and, ibn, rushd, where, part, of, this, philosophical, school, who, claimed, that, human, reason, surpassed, mere, coincidence, and, revelation, they, believed, for, example, that, natural, phenomena, occur, because, of, certain, rules, made, by, god, not, because, god, interfered, directly, unlike, al, ghazali, and, his, followers, other, notable, political, philosophers, of, the, time, include, nizam, al, mulk, a, persian, scholar, and, vizier, of, the, seljuq, empire, who, composed, the, siyasatnama, or, the, book, of, government, in, english, in, it, he, details, the, role, of, the, state, in, terms, of, political, affairs, i, e, how, to, deal, with, political, opponents, without, ruining, the, government, s, image, as, well, as, its, duty, to, protect, the, poor, and, reward, the, worthy, in, his, other, work, he, explains, how, the, state, should, deal, with, other, issues, such, as, supplying, jobs, to, immigrants, like, the, turkmens, who, were, coming, from, the, north, present, day, southern, russia, kazakhstan, turkmenistan, and, uzbekistan, the, 14th, century, arab, scholar, ibn, khaldun, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, political, theorists, the, british, philosopher, anthropologist, ernest, gellner, considered, ibn, khaldun, s, definition, of, government, an, institution, which, prevents, injustice, other, than, such, as, it, commits, itself, the, best, in, the, history, of, political, theory, for, ibn, khaldun, government, should, be, restrained, to, a, minimum, for, as, a, necessary, evil, it, is, the, constraint, of, men, by, other, men, medieval, political, philosophy, in, europe, was, heavily, influenced, by, christian, thinking, it, had, much, in, common, with, the, mutazilite, islamic, thinking, in, that, the, roman, catholics, thought, subordinating, philosophy, to, theology, did, not, subject, reason, to, revelation, but, in, the, case, of, contradictions, subordinated, reason, to, faith, as, the, asharite, of, islam, the, scholastics, by, combining, the, philosophy, of, aristotle, with, the, christianity, of, st, augustine, emphasized, the, potential, harmony, inherent, in, reason, and, revelation, perhaps, the, most, influential, political, philosopher, of, medieval, europe, was, st, thomas, aquinas, who, helped, reintroduce, aristotle, s, works, which, had, only, been, transmitted, to, catholic, europe, through, muslim, spain, along, with, the, commentaries, of, averroes, aquinas, s, use, of, them, set, the, agenda, for, scholastic, political, philosophy, dominated, european, thought, for, centuries, even, unto, the, renaissance, some, medieval, political, philosophers, such, as, aquinas, in, his, summa, theologica, developed, the, idea, that, a, king, who, is, a, tyrant, is, no, king, at, all, and, could, be, overthrown, others, like, nicole, oresme, in, his, livre, de, politiques, categorically, denied, this, right, to, overthrow, an, unjust, ruler, magna, carta, viewed, by, many, as, a, cornerstone, of, anglo, american, political, liberty, explicitly, proposes, the, right, to, revolt, against, the, ruler, for, justice, s, sake, other, documents, similar, to, magna, carta, are, found, in, other, european, countries, such, as, spain, and, hungary, during, the, renaissance, secular, political, philosophy, began, to, emerge, after, about, a, century, of, theological, political, thought, in, europe, while, the, middle, ages, did, see, secular, politics, in, practice, under, the, rule, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, academic, field, was, wholly, scholastic, and, therefore, christian, in, nature, one, of, the, most, influential, works, during, this, burgeoning, period, was, niccol, machiavelli, s, the, prince, written, between, 1511, 12, and, published, in, 1532, after, machiavelli, s, death, that, work, as, well, as, the, discourses, a, rigorous, analysis, of, classical, antiquity, did, much, to, influence, modern, political, thought, in, the, west, a, minority, including, jean, jacques, rousseau, interpreted, the, prince, as, a, satire, meant, to, be, given, to, the, medici, after, their, recapture, of, florence, and, their, subsequent, expulsion, of, machiavelli, from, florence, though, the, work, was, written, for, the, di, medici, family, in, order, to, perhaps, influence, them, to, free, him, from, exile, machiavelli, supported, the, republic, of, florence, rather, than, the, oligarchy, of, the, medici, family, at, any, rate, machiavelli, presents, a, pragmatic, and, somewhat, consequentialist, view, of, politics, whereby, good, and, evil, are, mere, means, used, to, bring, about, an, end, i, e, the, acquisition, and, maintenance, of, absolute, power, thomas, hobbes, well, known, for, his, theory, of, the, social, contract, goes, on, to, expand, this, view, at, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, during, the, english, renaissance, although, neither, machiavelli, nor, hobbes, believed, in, the, divine, right, of, kings, they, both, believed, in, the, inherent, selfishness, of, the, individual, it, was, necessarily, this, belief, that, led, them, to, adopt, a, strong, central, power, as, the, only, means, of, preventing, the, disintegration, of, the, social, order, during, the, enlightenment, period, new, theories, emerged, about, what, the, human, was, and, is, and, about, the, definition, of, reality, and, the, way, it, was, perceived, along, with, the, discovery, of, other, societies, in, the, americas, and, the, changing, needs, of, political, societies, especially, in, the, wake, of, the, english, civil, war, the, american, revolution, the, french, revolution, and, the, haitian, revolution, these, new, theories, led, to, new, questions, and, insights, by, such, thinkers, as, thomas, hobbes, john, locke, benjamin, constant, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, these, theorists, were, driven, by, two, basic, questions, one, by, what, right, or, need, do, people, form, states, and, two, what, the, best, form, for, a, state, could, be, these, fundamental, questions, involved, a, conceptual, distinction, between, the, concepts, of, state, and, government, it, was, decided, that, state, would, refer, to, a, set, of, enduring, institutions, through, which, power, would, be, distributed, and, its, use, justified, the, term, government, would, refer, to, a, specific, group, of, people, who, occupied, the, institutions, of, the, state, and, create, the, laws, and, ordinances, by, which, the, people, themselves, included, would, be, bound, this, conceptual, distinction, continues, to, operate, in, political, science, although, some, political, scientists, philosophers, historians, and, cultural, anthropologists, have, argued, that, most, political, action, in, any, given, society, occurs, outside, of, its, state, and, that, there, are, societies, that, are, not, organized, into, states, that, nevertheless, must, be, considered, in, political, terms, as, long, as, the, concept, of, natural, order, was, not, introduced, the, social, sciences, could, not, evolve, independently, of, theistic, thinking, since, the, cultural, revolution, of, the, 17th, century, in, england, which, spread, to, france, and, the, rest, of, europe, society, has, been, considered, subject, to, natural, laws, akin, to, the, physical, world, political, and, economic, relations, were, drastically, influenced, by, these, theories, as, the, concept, of, the, guild, was, subordinated, to, the, theory, of, free, trade, and, roman, catholic, dominance, of, theology, was, increasingly, challenged, by, protestant, churches, subordinate, to, each, nation, state, which, also, in, a, fashion, the, roman, catholic, church, often, decried, angrily, preached, in, the, vulgar, or, native, language, of, each, region, free, trade, as, opposed, to, these, religious, theories, is, a, trade, policy, that, does, not, restrict, imports, or, exports, it, can, also, be, understood, as, the, free, market, idea, applied, to, international, trade, in, government, free, trade, is, predominantly, advocated, by, political, parties, that, hold, liberal, economic, positions, while, economically, left, wing, and, nationalist, political, parties, generally, support, protectionism, the, opposite, of, free, trade, however, the, enlightenment, was, an, outright, attack, on, religion, particularly, christianity, the, most, outspoken, critic, of, the, church, in, france, was, fran, ois, marie, arouet, de, voltaire, a, representative, figure, of, the, enlightenment, historians, have, described, voltaire, s, description, of, the, history, of, christianity, as, propagandistic, voltaire, is, partially, responsible, for, the, misattribution, of, the, expression, credo, quia, absurdum, to, the, church, fathers, in, a, letter, to, frederick, ii, king, of, prussia, dated, 5, january, 1767, he, wrote, about, christianity, la, n, tre, est, sans, contredit, la, plus, ridicule, la, plus, absurde, et, la, plus, sanguinaire, qui, ait, jamais, infect, le, monde, ours, is, assuredly, the, most, ridiculous, the, most, absurd, and, the, most, bloody, religion, which, has, ever, infected, this, world, your, majesty, will, do, the, human, race, an, eternal, service, by, extirpating, this, infamous, superstition, i, do, not, say, among, the, rabble, who, are, not, worthy, of, being, enlightened, and, who, are, apt, for, every, yoke, i, say, among, honest, people, among, men, who, think, among, those, who, wish, to, think, my, one, regret, in, dying, is, that, i, cannot, aid, you, in, this, noble, enterprise, the, finest, and, most, respectable, which, the, human, mind, can, point, out, after, voltaire, religion, would, never, be, the, same, again, in, france, as, well, there, was, no, spread, of, this, doctrine, within, the, new, world, and, the, advanced, civilizations, of, the, aztec, maya, inca, mohican, delaware, huron, and, especially, the, iroquois, the, iroquois, philosophy, in, particular, gave, much, to, christian, thought, of, the, time, and, in, many, cases, actually, inspired, some, of, the, institutions, adopted, in, the, united, states, for, example, benjamin, franklin, was, a, great, admirer, of, some, of, the, methods, of, the, iroquois, confederacy, and, much, of, early, american, literature, emphasized, the, political, philosophy, of, the, natives, the, iroquois, r, kw, or, r, kw, or, haudenosaunee, are, a, historically, powerful, northeast, native, american, confederacy, in, north, america, they, were, known, during, the, colonial, years, to, the, french, as, the, iroquois, league, and, later, as, the, iroquois, confederacy, and, to, the, english, as, the, five, nations, comprising, the, mohawk, onondaga, oneida, cayuga, and, seneca, after, 1722, they, accepted, the, tuscarora, people, from, the, southeast, into, their, confederacy, as, they, were, also, iroquoian, speaking, and, became, known, as, the, six, nations, john, locke, in, particular, exemplified, this, new, age, of, political, theory, with, his, work, two, treatises, of, government, in, it, locke, proposes, a, state, of, nature, theory, that, directly, complements, his, conception, of, how, political, development, occurs, and, how, it, can, be, founded, through, contractual, obligation, locke, stood, to, refute, sir, robert, filmer, s, paternally, founded, political, theory, in, favor, of, a, natural, system, based, on, nature, in, a, particular, given, system, the, theory, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, became, a, passing, fancy, exposed, to, the, type, of, ridicule, with, which, john, locke, treated, it, unlike, machiavelli, and, hobbes, but, like, aquinas, locke, would, accept, aristotle, s, dictum, that, man, seeks, to, be, happy, in, a, state, of, social, harmony, as, a, social, animal, unlike, aquinas, s, preponderant, view, on, the, salvation, of, the, soul, from, original, sin, locke, believes, man, s, mind, comes, into, this, world, as, tabula, rasa, for, locke, knowledge, is, neither, innate, revealed, nor, based, on, authority, but, subject, to, uncertainty, tempered, by, reason, tolerance, and, moderation, according, to, locke, an, absolute, ruler, as, proposed, by, hobbes, is, unnecessary, for, natural, law, is, based, on, reason, and, seeking, peace, and, survival, for, man, john, stuart, mill, s, work, on, political, philosophy, begins, in, on, liberty, on, liberty, is, the, most, influential, statement, of, his, liberal, principles, he, begins, by, distinguishing, old, and, new, threats, to, liberty, the, old, threat, to, liberty, is, found, in, traditional, societies, in, which, there, is, rule, by, one, a, monarchy, or, a, few, an, aristocracy, though, one, could, be, worried, about, restrictions, on, liberty, by, benevolent, monarchs, or, aristocrats, the, traditional, worry, is, that, when, rulers, are, politically, unaccountable, to, the, governed, they, will, rule, in, their, own, interests, rather, than, the, interests, of, the, governed, mill, s, explicit, theory, of, rights, is, introduced, in, chapter, v, of, utilitarianism, in, the, context, of, his, sanction, theory, of, duty, which, is, an, indirect, form, of, utilitarianism, that, identifies, wrong, actions, as, actions, that, it, is, useful, to, sanction, mill, then, introduces, justice, as, a, proper, part, of, the, duty, justice, involves, duties, that, are, perfect, duties, that, is, duties, that, are, correlated, with, rights, justice, implies, something, which, it, is, not, only, right, to, do, and, wrong, not, to, do, but, which, some, individual, person, can, claim, from, us, as, a, matter, of, right, these, perfect, duties, will, thus, create, liberty, and, collective, freedom, within, a, state, he, uses, on, liberty, to, discuss, gender, equality, in, society, to, mill, utilitarianism, was, the, perfect, tool, to, justify, gender, equality, in, the, subjection, of, women, referring, to, the, political, lawful, and, social, subjection, of, women, when, a, woman, was, married, she, entered, legally, binding, coverture, with, her, husband, once, she, married, her, legal, existence, as, an, individual, was, suspended, under, marital, unity, while, it, is, easy, to, presume, that, a, woman, would, not, marry, under, these, circumstances, being, unmarried, had, social, consequences, a, woman, could, only, advance, in, social, stature, and, wealth, if, she, had, a, rich, husband, to, do, the, groundwork, mill, uses, his, utilitarian, ethics, to, assess, how, gender, equality, would, be, the, best, way, to, achieve, the, greatest, good, for, the, greatest, number, the, principle, that, regulates, the, existing, social, relations, between, the, two, sexes, and, is, now, one, of, the, chief, obstacles, to, human, improvement, the, chief, obstacle, to, mill, relates, to, women, s, intellectual, capability, the, subjection, of, women, looks, at, this, in, the, women, of, society, and, argues, that, diminishing, their, intellectual, potential, wastes, the, knowledge, and, skill, of, half, of, the, population, such, knowledge, lost, could, formulate, ideas, that, could, maximize, pleasure, for, society, one, of, the, first, thinkers, to, go, by, the, name, of, liberal, constant, looked, to, britain, rather, than, to, ancient, rome, for, a, practical, model, of, freedom, in, a, large, commercial, society, he, drew, a, distinction, between, the, liberty, of, the, ancients, and, the, liberty, of, the, moderns, the, liberty, of, the, ancients, was, participatory, republican, liberty, which, gave, the, citizens, the, right, to, directly, influence, politics, through, debates, and, votes, in, the, public, assembly, in, order, to, support, this, degree, of, participation, citizenship, was, a, burdensome, moral, obligation, requiring, a, considerable, investment, of, time, and, energy, generally, this, required, a, sub, society, of, slaves, to, do, much, of, the, productive, work, leaving, the, citizens, free, to, deliberate, on, public, affairs, ancient, liberty, was, also, limited, to, relatively, small, and, homogenous, societies, in, which, the, people, could, be, conveniently, gathered, together, in, one, place, to, transact, public, affairs, the, liberty, of, the, moderns, in, contrast, was, based, on, the, possession, of, civil, liberties, the, rule, of, law, and, freedom, from, excessive, state, interference, direct, participation, would, be, limited, a, necessary, consequence, of, the, size, of, modern, states, and, also, the, inevitable, result, of, having, created, a, commercial, society, in, which, there, are, no, slaves, but, almost, everybody, must, earn, a, living, through, work, instead, the, voters, would, elect, representatives, who, would, deliberate, in, parliament, on, behalf, of, the, people, and,

increasing, popular, support, mostly, from, the, urban, working, class, without, breaking, entirely, from, the, past, marx, established, principles, that, would, be, used, by, future, revolutionaries, of, the, 20th, century, namely, vladimir, lenin, mao, zedong, ho, chi, minh, and, fidel, castro, though, hegel, s, philosophy, of, history, is, similar, to, immanuel, kant, s, and, karl, marx, s, theory, of, revolution, towards, the, common, good, is, partly, based, on, kant, s, view, of, history, marx, declared, that, he, was, turning, hegel, s, dialectic, which, was, standing, on, its, head, the, right, side, up, again, unlike, marx, who, believed, in, historical, materialism, hegel, believed, in, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, by, the, late, 19th, century, socialism, and, trade, unions,

american, political, science, review, report, authored, by, harry, eckstein, political, philosophy, as, a, discipline, had, utility, in, two, ways, the, utility, of, political, philosophy, might, be, found, either, in, the, intrinsic, ability, of, the, best, of, past, political, thought, to, sharpen, the, wits, of, contemporary, political, thinkers, much, as, any, difficult, intellectual, exercise, sharpens, the, mind, and, deepens, the, imagination, or, in, the, ability, of, political, philosophy, to, serve, as, a, thought, saving, device, by, providing, the, political, scientist, with, a, rich, source, of, concepts, models, insights, theories, and, methods, from, the, end, of, world, war, ii, until, 1971, when, john, rawls, published, a, theory, of, justice, political,

with, marxism, dominating, the, field, this, was, the, time, of, jean, paul, sartre, and, louis, althusser, and, the, victories, of, mao, zedong, in, china, and, fidel, castro, in, cuba, as, well, as, the, events, of, may, 1968, which, led, to, increased, interest, in, revolutionary, ideology, especially, by, the, new, left, a, number, of, continental, european, migr, s, to, britain, and, the,

in, the, anglo, american, world, but, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, they, and, their, students, remained, at, odds, with, the, analytic, establishment, communism, remained, an, important, focus, especially, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, colonialism, and, racism, were, important, issues, that, arose, in, general, there, was, a, marked, trend, towards, a, pragmatic, approach, to, political, issues, rather, than, a, philosophical, one, much, academic, debate, regarded, one, or, both, of, two, pragmatic, topics, how, or, whether, to, apply, utilitarianism, to, problems, of, political, policy, or, how, or, whether, to, apply, economic, models, such, as, rational, choice, theory, to, political, issues, the, rise, of, feminism, lgbt, social, movements, and, the, end, of, colonial, rule, and, of, the, political, exclusion, of, such, minorities, as, african, americans, and, sexual, minorities, in, the, developed, world, has, led, to, feminist, postcolonial, and, multicultural, thought, becoming, significant, this, led, to, a, challenge, to, the, social, contract, by, philosophers, charles, w, mills, in, his, book, the, racial, contract, and, carole, pateman, in, her, book, the, sexual, contract, that, the, social, contract, excluded, persons, of, colour, and, women, respectively, in, anglo, american, academic, political, philosophy, the, publication, of, john, rawls, s, a, theory, of, justice, in, 1971, is, considered, a, milestone, rawls, used, a, thought, experiment, the, original, position, in, which, representative, parties, choose, principles, of, justice, for, the, basic, structure, of, society, from, behind, a, veil, of, ignorance, rawls, also, offered, a, criticism, of, utilitarian, approaches, to, questions, of, political, justice, robert, nozick, s, 1974, book, anarchy, state, and, utopia, which, won, a, national, book, award, responded, to, rawls, from, a, libertarian, perspective, and, gained, academic, respectability, for, libertarian, viewpoints, contemporaneously, with, the, rise, of, analytic, ethics, in, anglo, american, thought, in, europe, several, new, lines, of, philosophy, directed, at, the, critique, of, existing, societies, arose, between, the, 1950s, and, 1980s, most, of, these, took, elements, of, marxist, economic, analysis, but, combined, them, with, a, more, cultural, or, ideological, emphasis, out, of, the, frankfurt, school, thinkers, like, herbert, marcuse, theodor, w, adorno, max, horkheimer, and, j, rgen, habermas, combined, marxian, and, freudian, perspectives, along, somewhat, different, lines, a, number, of, other, continental, thinkers, still, largely, influenced, by, marxism, put, new, emphases, on, structuralism, and, on, a, return, to, hegel, within, the, post, structuralist, line, though, mostly, not, taking, that, label, are, thinkers, such, as, gilles, deleuze, michel, foucault, claude, lefort, and, jean, baudrillard, the, situationists, were, more, influenced, by, hegel, guy, debord, in, particular, moved, a, marxist, analysis, of, commodity, fetishism, to, the, realm, of, consumption, and, looked, at, the, relation, between, consumerism, and, dominant, ideology, formation, another, debate, developed, around, the, distinct, criticisms, of, liberal, political, theory, made, by, michael, walzer, michael, sandel, and, charles, taylor, the, liberal, communitarian, debate, is, often, considered, valuable, for, generating, a, new, set, of, philosophical, problems, rather, than, a, profound, and, illuminating, clash, of, perspective, these, and, other, communitarians, such, as, alasdair, macintyre, and, daniel, a, bell, argue, that, contra, liberalism, communities, are, prior, to, individuals, and, therefore, should, be, the, center, of, political, focus, communitarians, tend, to, support, greater, local, control, as, well, as, economic, and, social, policies, which, encourage, the, growth, of, social, capital, a, prominent, subject, in, recent, political, philosophy, is, the, theory, of, deliberative, democracy, the, seminal, work, was, done, by, jurgen, habermas, in, germany, but, the, most, extensive, literature, has, been, in, english, led, by, theorists, such, as, jane, mansbridge, joshua, cohen, amy, gutmann, and, dennis, thompson, a, pair, of, overlapping, political, perspectives, arising, toward, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, are, republicanism, or, neo, or, civic, republicanism, and, the, capability, approach, the, resurgent, republican, movement, aims, to, provide, an, alternative, definition, of, liberty, from, isaiah, berlin, s, positive, and, negative, forms, of, liberty, namely, liberty, as, non, domination, unlike, the, american, liberal, movement, which, understands, liberty, as, non, interference, non, domination, entails, individuals, not, being, subject, to, the, arbitrary, will, of, any, other, person, to, a, republican, the, mere, status, as, a, slave, regardless, of, how, that, slave, is, treated, is, objectionable, prominent, republicans, include, historian, quentin, skinner, jurist, cass, sunstein, and, political, philosopher, philip, pettit, the, capability,

ability, to, act, both, the, capability, approach, and, republicanism, treat, choice, as, something, which, must, be, resourced, in, other, words, it, is, not, enough, to, be, legally, able, to, do, something, but, to, have, the, real, option, of, doing, it, another, important, strand, of, contemporary, political, theory, in, north, america, draws, on, thinkers, such, as, friedrich, nietzsche, michel, foucault, jacques, derrida, and, gilles, deleuze, among, others, to, develop, critiques, and, articulate, alternatives, to, the, sufficiency, of, the, liberal, communitarian, debate, and, republicanism, discourse, since, the, 1990s, these, political, theorists, broadly, engaging, the, genealogical, approach, deconstruction, and, weak, ontology, have, expanded, the, scope, of, political, theory, and, issued, a, variety, of, arguments, on, topics, such, as, pluralism, agonism, gender, performativity, secularism, and, more, recently, the, anthropocene, and, the, non, human, turn, the, works, of, judith, butler, william, e, connolly, wendy, brown, jane, bennett, bonnie, honig, and, chantal, mouffe, have, been, highly, pertinent, in, this, regard, a, larger, list, of, political, philosophers, is, intended, to, be, closer, to, exhaustive, listed, below, are, some, of, the, most, canonical, or, important, thinkers, and, especially, philosophers, whose, central, focus, was, in, political, philosophy, and, or, who, are, good, representatives, of, a, particular, school, of, thought
