sharia, shar, ah, shari, a, shariah, or, syariah, arabic, lit, path, to, water, is, a, body, of, religious, law, that, forms, a, part, of, the, islamic, tradition, based, on, scriptures, of, islam, particularly, the, qur, an, and, hadith, in, arabic, the, term, shar, ah, refers, to, allah, s, immutable, divine, law, and, this, is, contrasted, with, fiqh, arabic, lit, jurisprudence, which, refers, to, its, interpretations, by, islamic, scholars, fiqh, in, a, sense, the, practical, application, side, of, sharia, was, manipulated, over, the, centuries, by, illegal, opinions, issued, by, qualified, jurists, and, sharia, has, never, been, the, sole, valid, legal, system, in, islam, historically, it, has, always, been, used, alongside, customary, law, from, the, beginning, and, applied, in, courts, by, ruler, appointed, judges, integrated, with, various, economic, criminal, and, administrative, laws, issued, by, muslim, rulers, traditional, theory, of, islamic, jurisprudence, recognizes, four, sources, of, sharia, the, qur, an, sunnah, or, authentic, ahadith, ijma, lit, consensus, may, be, understood, as, ijma, al, ummah, arabic, a, whole, islamic, community, consensus, or, ijma, al, aimmah, arabic, a, consensus, by, religious, authorities, and, analogical, reasoning, four, legal, schools, of, sunni, islam, hanafi, maliki, shafi, i, and, hanbali, developed, methodologies, for, deriving, rulings, from, scriptural, sources, using, a, process, known, as, ijtihad, arabic, lit, physical, or, mental, effort, traditional, jurisprudence, distinguishes, two, principal, branches, of, law, rituals, and, social, dealings, subsections, family, law, relationships, commercial, political, administrative, and, criminal, law, in, a, wide, range, of, topics, its, rulings, are, concerned, with, ethical, standards, as, much, as, legal, norms, assigning, actions, to, one, of, five, categories, mandatory, recommended, neutral, abhorred, and, prohibited, some, have, argued, that, the, definition, of, good, and, evil, which, is, frequently, repeated, in, the, quran, regarding, the, attributes, of, believers, as, those, who, command, ma, ruf, and, forbid, munkar, al, imran, 104, and, is, also, used, in, islamist, indoctrination, is, hidden, in, this, classification, over, time, with, the, necessities, brought, by, sociological, changes, on, the, basis, of, mentioned, interpretative, studies, legal, schools, have, emerged, reflecting, the, preferences, of, particular, societies, and, governments, as, well, as, islamic, scholars, or, imams, on, theoretical, and, practical, applications, of, laws, and, regulations, although, sharia, is, presented, as, a, form, of, governance, in, addition, to, its, other, aspects, especially, by, the, contemporary, islamist, understanding, some, researchers, see, the, early, history, of, islam, which, has, been, modelled, and, exalted, by, most, muslims, not, as, a, period, when, sharia, was, dominant, but, a, kind, of, secular, arabic, expansion, approaches, to, sharia, in, the, 21st, century, vary, widely, and, the, role, and, mutability, of, sharia, in, a, changing, world, has, become, an, increasingly, debated, topic, in, islam, beyond, sectarian, differences, fundamentalists, advocate, the, complete, and, uncompromising, implementation, of, exact, pure, sharia, without, modifications, while, modernists, argue, that, it, can, should, be, brought, into, line, with, human, rights, and, other, contemporary, issues, such, as, democracy, minority, rights, freedom, of, thought, women, s, rights, and, banking, by, new, jurisprudences, in, muslim, majority, countries, traditional, laws, have, been, widely, used, with, or, changed, by, european, models, judicial, procedures, and, legal, education, have, been, brought, in, line, with, european, practice, likewise, while, the, constitutions, of, most, muslim, majority, states, contain, references, to, sharia, its, rules, are, largely, retained, only, in, family, law, the, islamic, revival, of, the, late, 20th, century, brought, calls, by, islamic, movements, for, full, implementation, of, sharia, including, hudud, corporal, punishments, such, as, stoning, the, word, shar, ah, is, used, by, arabic, speaking, peoples, of, the, middle, east, to, designate, a, prophetic, religion, in, its, totality, for, example, shar, at, m, s, means, law, or, religion, of, moses, and, shar, atu, n, can, mean, our, religion, in, reference, to, any, monotheistic, faith, within, islamic, discourse, ar, ah, refers, to, religious, regulations, governing, the, lives, of, muslims, for, many, muslims, the, word, means, simply, justice, and, they, will, consider, any, law, that, promotes, justice, and, social, welfare, to, conform, to, sharia, sharia, is, the, first, of, four, doors, and, the, lowest, level, on, the, path, to, god, in, sufism, and, in, branches, of, islam, that, are, influenced, by, sufism, such, as, ismailism, and, alawites, it, is, necessary, to, reach, from, sharia, to, tariqa, from, there, to, ma, rifa, and, finally, to, haqiqa, in, each, of, these, gates, there, are, 10, levels, that, the, dervish, must, pass, through, jan, michiel, otto, summarizes, the, evolutionary, stages, of, understanding, by, distinguishing, four, meanings, conveyed, by, the, term, sharia, in, discourses, a, related, term, al, q, n, n, al, isl, m, islamic, law, which, was, borrowed, from, european, usage, in, the, late, 19th, century, is, used, in, the, muslim, world, to, refer, to, a, legal, system, in, the, context, of, a, modern, state, the, primary, meanings, of, the, arabic, word, ar, ah, derived, from, the, root, r, the, lexicographical, studies, records, two, major, areas, of, the, word, can, appear, without, religious, connotation, in, texts, evoking, a, pastoral, or, nomadic, environment, ar, ah, and, its, derivatives, refers, to, watering, animals, at, a, permanent, water, hole, or, to, the, seashore, one, another, area, of, use, relates, to, notions, of, stretched, or, lengthy, the, word, is, cognate, with, the, hebrew, sara, and, is, likely, to, be, the, origin, of, the, meaning, way, or, path, some, scholars, describe, it, as, an, archaic, arabic, word, denoting, pathway, to, be, followed, analogous, to, the, hebrew, term, halakhah, or, path, to, the, water, hole, and, argue, that, its, adoption, as, a, metaphor, for, a, divinely, ordained, way, of, life, arises, from, the, importance, of, water, in, an, arid, desert, environment, in, the, quran, ar, ah, and, its, cognate, ir, ah, occur, once, each, with, the, meaning, way, or, path, the, word, ar, ah, was, widely, used, by, arabic, speaking, jews, during, the, middle, ages, being, the, most, common, translation, for, the, word, torah, in, the, 10th, century, arabic, translation, of, the, torah, by, sa, adya, gaon, a, similar, use, of, the, term, can, be, found, in, christian, writers, the, arabic, expression, shar, at, all, h, god, s, law, is, a, common, translation, for, god, s, law, in, hebrew, and, god, s, law, in, greek, in, the, new, testament, in, muslim, literature, ar, ah, designates, the, laws, or, message, of, a, prophet, or, god, in, contrast, to, fiqh, which, refers, to, a, scholar, s, interpretation, thereof, in, older, english, language, law, related, works, in, the, late, 19th, early, 20th, centuries, the, word, used, for, sharia, was, sheri, it, along, with, the, french, variant, ch, ri, was, used, during, the, time, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, is, from, the, turkish, er, i, some, articles, that, may, be, considered, precursors, of, sharia, law, and, rituals, can, be, found, in, the, pre, islamic, arabic, religions, hajj, sal, t, and, zak, t, could, be, seen, in, pre, islamic, safaitic, arabic, inscriptions, and, continuity, can, be, observed, in, many, details, especially, in, todays, hajj, and, umrah, rituals, the, veiling, order, which, distinguishes, between, slaves, and, free, women, in, islam, also, coincides, with, similar, distinctions, seen, in, pre, islamic, civilizations, qisas, was, a, practice, used, as, a, resolution, tool, in, inter, tribal, conflicts, in, pre, islamic, arab, society, the, basis, of, this, resolution, was, that, a, member, from, the, tribe, to, which, the, murderer, belonged, was, handed, over, to, the, victim, s, family, for, execution, equivalent, to, the, social, status, of, the, murdered, person, the, condition, of, social, equivalence, meant, the, execution, of, a, member, of, the, murderer, s, tribe, who, was, equivalent, to, the, murdered, person, for, example, only, a, slave, could, be, killed, for, a, slave, and, a, woman, for, a, woman, in, other, cases, compensatory, payment, diya, could, be, paid, to, the, family, of, the, murdered, on, top, of, this, pre, islamic, understanding, added, a, debate, about, whether, a, muslim, can, be, executed, for, a, non, muslim, during, the, islamic, period, the, main, verse, for, implementation, in, islam, is, al, baqara, 178, believers, retaliation, is, ordained, for, you, regarding, the, people, who, were, killed, free, versus, free, slave, versus, slave, woman, versus, woman, whoever, is, forgiven, by, the, brother, of, the, slain, for, a, price, let, him, abide, by, the, custom, and, pay, the, price, well, according, to, the, traditionalist, athar, muslim, view, the, major, precepts, of, sharia, were, passed, down, directly, from, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, without, historical, development, and, the, emergence, of, islamic, jurisprudence, fiqh, also, goes, back, to, the, lifetime, of, muhammad, in, this, view, his, companions, and, followers, took, what, he, did, and, approved, of, as, a, model, sunnah, and, transmitted, this, information, to, the, succeeding, generations, in, the, form, of, hadith, these, reports, led, first, to, informal, discussion, and, then, systematic, legal, thought, articulated, with, greatest, success, in, the, eighth, and, ninth, centuries, by, the, master, jurists, abu, hanifa, malik, ibn, anas, al, shafi, i, and, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, who, are, viewed, as, the, founders, of, the, hanafi, maliki, shafi, i, and, hanbali, legal, schools, madh, hib, of, sunni, jurisprudence, modern, historians, have, presented, alternative, theories, of, the, formation, of, fiqh, at, first, western, scholars, accepted, the, general, outlines, of, the, traditionalist, account, in, the, late, 19th, century, an, influential, revisionist, hypothesis, was, advanced, by, ign, c, goldziher, and, elaborated, by, joseph, schacht, in, the, mid, 20th, century, schacht, and, other, scholars, argued, that, having, conquered, much, more, populous, agricultural, and, urban, societies, with, already, existing, laws, and, legal, needs, the, initial, muslim, efforts, to, formulate, legal, norms, regarded, the, quran, and, muhammad, s, hadiths, as, just, one, source, of, law, with, jurist, personal, opinions, the, legal, practice, of, conquered, peoples, and, the, decrees, and, decisions, of, the, caliphs, also, being, valid, sources, according, to, this, theory, most, canonical, hadiths, did, not, originate, with, muhammad, but, were, actually, created, at, a, later, date, despite, the, efforts, of, hadith, scholars, to, weed, out, fabrications, after, it, became, accepted, that, legal, norms, must, be, formally, grounded, in, scriptural, sources, proponents, of, rules, of, jurisprudence, supported, by, the, hadith, would, extend, the, chains, of, transmission, of, the, hadith, back, to, muhammad, s, companions, in, his, view, the, real, architect, of, islamic, jurisprudence, was, al, shafi, i, died, 820, ce, 204, ah, who, formulated, this, idea, that, legal, norms, must, be, formally, grounded, in, scriptural, sources, and, other, elements, of, classical, legal, theory, in, his, work, al, risala, but, who, was, preceded, by, a, body, of, islamic, law, not, based, on, primacy, of, muhammad, s, hadiths, while, the, origin, of, hadith, remains, a, subject, of, scholarly, controversy, this, theory, of, goldziher, and, schacht, has, given, rise, to, objections, and, modern, historians, generally, adopt, more, cautious, intermediate, positions, and, it, is, generally, accepted, that, early, islamic, jurisprudence, developed, out, of, a, combination, of, administrative, and, popular, practices, shaped, by, the, religious, and, ethical, precepts, of, islam, it, continued, some, aspects, of, pre, islamic, laws, and, customs, of, the, lands, that, fell, under, muslim, rule, in, the, aftermath, of, the, early, conquests, and, modified, other, aspects, aiming, to, meet, the, practical, need, of, establishing, islamic, norms, of, behavior, and, adjudicating, disputes, arising, in, the, early, muslim, communities, juristic, thought, gradually, developed, in, study, circles, where, independent, scholars, met, to, learn, from, a, local, master, and, discuss, religious, topics, at, first, these, circles, were, fluid, in, their, membership, but, with, time, distinct, regional, legal, schools, crystallized, around, shared, sets, of, methodological, principles, as, the, boundaries, of, the, schools, became, clearly, delineated, the, authority, of, their, doctrinal, tenets, came, to, be, vested, in, a, master, jurist, from, earlier, times, who, was, henceforth, identified, as, the, school, s, founder, in, the, course, of, the, first, three, centuries, of, islam, all, legal, schools, came, to, accept, the, broad, outlines, of, classical, legal, theory, according, to, which, islamic, law, had, to, be, firmly, rooted, in, the, quran, and, hadith, fiqh, is, traditionally, divided, into, the, fields, of, u, l, al, fiqh, lit, the, roots, of, fiqh, which, studies, the, theoretical, principles, of, jurisprudence, and, fur, al, fiqh, lit, the, branches, of, fiqh, which, is, devoted, to, elaboration, of, rulings, on, the, basis, of, these, principles, classical, islamic, jurisprudence, refers, how, to, elaborate, and, interpret, religious, sources, that, are, considered, reliable, within, the, framework, of, procedural, principles, within, its, context, such, as, linguistic, and, rhetorical, tools, to, derive, judgments, for, new, situations, by, taking, into, account, certain, purposes, and, mesalih, textual, phrases, usually, dealt, with, under, simple, antithetical, headings, general, and, particular, command, and, prohibition, obscure, and, clear, truth, and, metaphor, it, also, comprises, methods, for, establishing, authenticity, of, hadith, and, for, determining, when, the, legal, force, of, a, scriptural, passage, is, abrogated, by, a, passage, revealed, at, a, later, date, the, sources, of, judgment, in, classical, fiqh, are, roughly, divided, into, two, manq, l, t, quran, and, hadith, and, aqliyy, t, ijma, qiyas, ijtihad, and, others, some, of, them, aqliyy, t, are, considered, to, be, the, product, of, scholastic, theology, and, aristotelian, logic, it, was, an, important, area, of, debate, among, traditional, fiqh, scholars, how, much, space, should, be, given, to, rational, methods, in, creating, provisions, such, as, extracting, provisions, from, religious, texts, as, well, as, expanding, restricting, abolishing, or, postponing, these, provisions, according, to, new, situations, considering, the, purpose, and, benefit, together, with, new, sociologies, in, the, face, of, changing, conditions, in, this, context, in, the, classical, period, the, ulema, were, divided, into, groups, among, other, divisions, such, as, political, divisions, regarding, the, place, of, aql, vis, vis, naql, those, who, rely, on, narration, atharists, ahl, al, hadith, those, who, rely, on, reason, ahl, al, kal, m, mu, tazila, and, ahl, al, ra, y, and, those, who, tried, to, find, a, middle, way, between, the, two, attitudes, such, as, abu, al, hasan, al, ash, ari, in, theology, syncretists, in, the, classical, age, of, islam, there, were, violent, conflicts, between, rationalists, aqliyyun, al, mu, tazila, kalamiyya, and, traditionalist, naqliyyun, literalists, ahl, al, hadith, groups, and, sects, regarding, the, quran, and, hadith, or, the, place, of, reason, in, understanding, the, quran, and, hadith, as, can, be, seen, in, the, mihna, example, although, the, rationalists, initially, seemed, to, gain, the, upper, hand, in, this, conflict, with, the, rise, of, literalism, the, mutazila, sank, into, history, and, literalism, continued, to, live, by, gaining, supporters, in, this, context, the, formulation, of, the, sunni, view, can, be, summarized, as, follows, human, reason, is, a, gift, from, god, which, should, be, exercised, to, its, fullest, capacity, however, use, of, reason, alone, is, insufficient, to, distinguish, right, from, wrong, and, rational, argumentation, must, draw, its, content, from, the, body, of, transcendental, knowledge, revealed, in, the, quran, and, through, the, sunnah, of, muhammad, in, addition, to, the, quran, and, sunnah, the, classical, theory, of, sunni, fiqh, recognizes, two, other, sources, of, law, juristic, consensus, ijma, and, analogical, reasoning, qiyas, it, therefore, studies, the, application, and, limits, of, analogy, as, well, as, the, value, and, limits, of, consensus, along, with, other, methodological, principles, some, of, which, are, accepted, by, only, certain, legal, schools, this, interpretive, apparatus, is, brought, together, under, the, rubric, of, ijtihad, which, refers, to, a, jurist, s, exertion, in, an, attempt, to, arrive, at, a, ruling, on, a, particular, question, the, theory, of, twelver, shia, jurisprudence, parallels, that, of, sunni, schools, with, some, differences, such, as, recognition, of, reason, aql, as, a, source, of, law, in, place, of, qiyas, and, extension, of, the, notion, of, sunnah, to, include, traditions, of, the, imams, islamic, scholar, rashid, rida, 1865, 1935, ce, lists, the, four, basic, sources, of, islamic, law, agreed, upon, by, all, sunni, muslims, the, sources, of, legislation, in, islam, are, four, the, qur, an, the, sunnah, the, consensus, of, the, ummah, and, ijtihad, undertaken, by, competent, jurists, the, textual, integrity, and, divinity, of, the, quran, which, are, considered, primary, sources, in, traditional, islam, cannot, be, questioned, taken, lightly, or, made, a, subject, of, criticism, and, comedy, the, authenticity, of, hadiths, can, only, be, questioned, through, the, chain, of, narration, acts, to, the, contrary, may, be, punished, as, denial, and, apostasy, some, researchers, however, suggests, that, primary, sources, may, have, also, evolved, contrary, to, traditional, knowledge, gerd, r, puin, lawrence, conrad, patricia, crone, and, joseph, schacht, reached, these, conclusions, by, examining, early, quranic, manuscriptss, sirah, books, written, in, the, early, period, of, islam, changes, in, sunnah, and, hadith, terminologies, and, the, chains, of, narration, of, hadith, respectively, only, several, verses, of, the, quran, have, direct, legal, relevance, and, they, are, concentrated, in, a, few, specific, areas, such, as, inheritance, though, other, passages, have, been, used, as, a, source, for, general, principles, whose, legal, ramifications, were, elaborated, by, other, means, islamic, literature, calls, the, laws, that, can, be, associated, with, the, quran, in, sharia, hudud, meaning, the, limits, set, by, allah, the, body, of, hadith, provides, more, detailed, and, practical, legal, guidance, but, it, was, recognized, early, on, that, not, all, of, them, were, authentic, early, islamic, scholars, developed, personal, criteria, for, evaluating, their, authenticity, by, assessing, trustworthiness, of, the, individuals, listed, in, their, transmission, chains, these, studies, narrowed, down, the, vast, corpus, of, prophetic, traditions, to, several, thousand, sound, seeming, to, collectors, hadiths, which, were, collected, in, several, canonical, compilations, the, hadiths, which, enjoyed, concurrent, transmission, were, deemed, mutawatir, however, the, vast, majority, of, hadiths, were, handed, down, by, only, one, or, a, few, transmitters, and, were, therefore, seen, to, yield, only, probable, knowledge, the, uncertainty, was, further, compounded, by, ambiguity, of, the, language, contained, in, some, hadiths, and, quranic, passages, disagreements, on, the, relative, merits, and, interpretation, of, the, textual, sources, allowed, legal, scholars, considerable, leeway, in, formulating, alternative, rulings, maq, id, aims, or, purposes, of, sharia, and, ma, la, a, welfare, or, public, interest, are, two, related, classical, doctrines, which, have, come, to, play, an, increasingly, prominent, role, in, modern, times, ab, h, mid, al, ghaz, l, izz, al, din, ibn, abd, al, salam, and, abu, ishaq, al, shatibi, used, maslaha, and, madas, d, as, equivalent, terms, synonyms, for, the, term, maq, id, a, ar, a, are, the, expressions, maq, id, a, ri, intentions, of, the, legislature, maq, id, at, ta, r, intentions, of, the, legislature, ru, a, ar, a, spirit, of, sharia, ikmat, at, ta, r, wisdom, of, legislation, and, falsafat, at, ta, r, philosophy, of, legislation, they, were, first, clearly, articulated, by, al, ghazali, d, 1111, who, argued, that, maq, id, and, maslaha, was, god, s, general, purpose, in, revealing, the, divine, law, and, that, its, specific, aim, was, preservation, of, five, essentials, of, human, well, being, religion, life, intellect, offspring, and, property, although, most, classical, era, jurists, recognized, maslaha, and, maqasid, as, important, legal, principles, they, held, different, views, regarding, the, role, they, should, play, in, islamic, law, some, jurists, viewed, them, as, auxiliary, rationales, constrained, by, scriptural, sources, and, analogical, reasoning, others, regarded, them, as, an, independent, source, of, law, whose, general, principles, could, override, specific, inferences, based, on, the, letter, of, scripture, taking, maqasid, and, maslaha, as, an, independent, source, of, sharia, rather, than, an, auxiliary, one, will, pave, the, way, for, the, re, critique, and, reorganization, of, ahkam, in, the, context, of, maqasid, and, maslaha, thus, including, hudud, which, is, often, criticized, in, terms, of, today, s, values, and, seen, as, problematic, in, terms, of, the, purposes, of, sharia, and, social, benefits, will, be, replaced, by, new, ones, abdallah, bin, bayyah, goes, further, with, an, approach, that, prioritizes, purpose, and, benefit, among, the, sources, of, sharia, and, declares, it, to, be, the, heart, of, usul, al, fiqh, while, the, latter, view, was, held, by, a, minority, of, classical, jurists, in, modern, times, it, came, to, be, championed, in, different, forms, by, prominent, scholars, who, sought, to, adapt, islamic, law, to, changing, social, conditions, by, drawing, on, the, intellectual, heritage, of, traditional, jurisprudence, these, scholars, expanded, the, inventory, of, maqasid, to, include, such, aims, of, sharia, as, reform, and, women, s, rights, rashid, rida, justice, and, freedom, mohammed, al, ghazali, and, human, rights, and, dignity, yusuf, al, qaradawi, ijtihad, lit, physical, or, mental, effort, refers, to, independent, reasoning, by, an, expert, in, islamic, law, or, exertion, of, a, jurist, s, mentality, in, finding, a, solution, to, a, legal, question, in, contrast, with, taqlid, conformity, to, precedent, ijtihad, according, to, theory, ijtihad, requires, expertise, in, the, arabic, language, theology, religious, texts, and, principles, of, jurisprudence, usul, al, fiqh, and, is, not, employed, where, authentic, and, trusted, texts, qur, an, and, hadith, are, considered, unambiguous, with, regard, to, the, question, or, where, there, is, an, existing, scholarly, consensus, ijma, an, islamic, scholar, who, perform, ijtihad, is, called, mujtahid, throughout, the, first, five, islamic, centuries, ijtihad, continued, to, practise, amongst, sunni, muslims, the, controversy, surrounding, ijtihad, started, with, the, beginning, of, the, twelfth, century, by, the, 14th, century, islamic, fiqh, prompted, leading, sunni, jurists, to, state, that, the, main, legal, questions, had, been, addressed, and, then, ijtihad, was, gradually, restricted, in, the, modern, era, this, gave, rise, to, a, perception, amongst, orientalist, scholars, and, sections, of, the, muslim, public, that, the, so, called, gate, of, ijtihad, was, closed, at, the, start, of, the, classical, era, starting, from, the, 18th, century, islamic, reformers, began, calling, for, abandonment, of, taqlid, and, emphasis, on, ijtihad, which, they, saw, as, a, return, to, islamic, origins, the, advocacy, of, ijtihad, has, been, particularly, associated, with, islamic, modernism, and, salafiyya, movements, among, contemporary, muslims, in, the, west, there, have, emerged, new, visions, of, ijtihad, which, emphasize, substantive, moral, values, over, traditional, juridical, undertandings, shia, jurists, did, not, use, the, term, ijtihad, until, the, 12th, century, with, the, exception, of, zaydis, the, early, imami, shia, were, unanimous, in, censuring, ijtihad, in, the, field, of, law, ahkam, until, the, shiite, embrace, of, various, doctrines, of, mu, tazila, and, classical, sunnite, fiqh, after, the, victory, of, the, usulis, who, based, law, on, principles, usul, over, the, akhbaris, traditionalists, who, emphasized, on, reports, or, traditions, khabar, by, the, 19th, century, ijtihad, would, become, a, mainstream, shia, practice, the, classical, process, of, ijtihad, combined, these, generally, recognized, principles, with, other, methods, which, were, not, adopted, by, all, legal,

take, into, account, personal, labels, such, as, the, gender, freedom, religious, and, social, status, such, as, mu, min, kafir, musta, min, dhimmi, apostate, etc, islamic, preachers, constantly,

each, of, these, terms, figuratively, stood, for, a, variety, of, subjects, for, example, the, quarter, of, sales, would, encompass, partnerships, guaranty, gifts, and, bequests, among, other, topics, juristic, works, were, arranged, as, a, sequence, of, such, smaller, topics, each, called, a, book, kitab, the, special, significance, of, ritual, was, marked, by, always, placing, its, discussion, at, the, start, of, the, work, some, historians, distinguish, a, field, of, islamic, criminal, law, which, combines, several, traditional, categories, several, crimes, with, scripturally, prescribed, punishments, are, known, as, hudud, jurists, developed, various, restrictions, which, in, many, cases, made, them, virtually, impossible, to, apply, other, crimes, involving, intentional, bodily, harm, are, judged, according, to, a, version, of, lex, talionis, that, prescribes, a, punishment, analogous, to, the, crime, qisas, but, the, victims, or, their, heirs, may, accept, a, monetary, compensation, diya, or, pardon, the, perpetrator, instead, only, diya, is, imposed, for, non, intentional, harm, other, criminal, cases, belong, to, the, category, of, ta, z, r, where, the, goal, of, punishment, is, correction, or, rehabilitation, of, the, culprit, and, its, form, is, largely, left, to, the, judge, s, discretion, in, practice, since, early, on, in, islamic, history, criminal, cases, were, usually, handled, by, ruler, administered, courts, or, local, police, using, procedures, which, were, only, loosely, related, to, sharia, the, two, major, genres, of, fur, literature, are, the, mukhtasar, concise, summary, of, law, and, the, mabsut, extensive, commentary, mukhtasars, were, short, specialized, treatises, or, general, overviews, that, could, be, used, in, a, classroom, or, consulted, by, judges, a, mabsut, which, usually, provided, a, commentary, on, a, mukhtasar, and, could, stretch, to, dozens, of, large, volumes, recorded, alternative, rulings, with, their, justifications, often, accompanied, by, a, proliferation, of, cases, and, conceptual, distinctions, the, terminology, of, juristic, literature, was, conservative, and, tended, to, preserve, notions, which, had, lost, their, practical, relevance, at, the, same, time, the, cycle, of, abridgement, and, commentary, allowed, jurists, of, each, generation, to, articulate, a, modified, body, of, law, to, meet, changing, social, conditions, other, juristic, genres, include, the, qaw, id, succinct, formulas, meant, to, aid, the, student, remember, general, principles, and, collections, of, fatwas, by, a, particular, scholar, classical, jurisprudence, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, major, intellectual, achievements, of, islam, and, its, importance, in, islam, has, been, compared, to, that, of, theology, in, christianity, the, main, sunni, schools, of, law, madhhabs, are, the, hanafi, maliki, shafi, i, and, hanbali, madhhabs, they, emerged, in, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, and, by, the, twelfth, century, almost, all, jurists, aligned, themselves, with, a, particular, madhhab, these, four, schools, recognize, each, other, s, validity, and, they, have, interacted, in, legal, debate, over, the, centuries, rulings, of, these, schools, are, followed, across, the, muslim, world, without, exclusive, regional, restrictions, but, they, each, came, to, dominate, in, different, parts, of, the, world, for, example, the, maliki, school, is, predominant, in, north, and, west, africa, the, hanafi, school, in, south, and, central, asia, the, shafi, i, school, in, lower, egypt, east, africa, and, southeast, asia, and, the, hanbali, school, in, north, and, central, arabia, the, first, centuries, of, islam, also, witnessed, a, number, of, short, lived, sunni, madhhabs, the, zahiri, school, which, is, commonly, identified, as, extinct, continues, to, exert, influence, over, legal, thought, the, development, of, shia, legal, schools, occurred, along, the, lines, of, theological, differences, and, resulted, in, formation, of, the, twelver, zaidi, and, ismaili, madhhabs, whose, differences, from, sunni, legal, schools, are, roughly, of, the, same, order, as, the, differences, among, sunni, schools, the, ibadi, legal, school, distinct, from, sunni, and, shia, madhhabs, is, predominant, in, oman, the, transformations, of, islamic, legal, institutions, in, the, modern, era, have, had, profound, implications, for, the, madhhab, system, legal, practice, in, most, of, the, muslim, world, has, come, to, be, controlled, by, government, policy, and, state, law, so, that, the, influence, of, the, madhhabs, beyond, personal, ritual, practice, depends, on, the, status, accorded, to, them, within, the, national, legal, system, state, law, codification, commonly, utilized, the, methods, of, takhayyur, selection, of, rulings, without, restriction, to, a, particular, madhhab, and, talfiq, combining, parts, of, different, rulings, on, the, same, question, legal, professionals, trained, in, modern, law, schools, have, largely, replaced, traditional, ulema, as, interpreters, of, the, resulting, laws, global, islamic, movements, have, at, times, drawn, on, different, madhhabs, and, at, other, times, placed, greater, focus, on, the, scriptural, sources, rather, than, classical, jurisprudence, the, hanbali, school, with, its, particularly, strict, adherence, to, the, quran, and, hadith, has, inspired, conservative, currents, of, direct, scriptural, interpretation, by, the, salafi, and, wahhabi, movements, other, currents, such, as, networks, of, indonesian, ulema, and, islamic, scholars, residing, in, muslim, minority, countries, have, advanced, liberal, interpretations, of, islamic, law, without, focusing, on, traditions, of, a, particular, madhhab, sharia, was, traditionally, interpreted, by, muftis, during, the, first, few, centuries, of, islam, muftis, were, private, legal, specialists, who, normally, also, held, other, jobs, they, issued, fatwas, legal, opinions, generally, free, of, charge, in, response, to, questions, from, laypersons, or, requests, for, consultation, coming, from, judges, which, would, be, stated, in, general, terms, fatwas, were, regularly, upheld, in, courts, and, when, they, were, not, it, was, usually, because, the, fatwa, was, contradicted, by, a, more, authoritative, legal, opinion, the, stature, of, jurists, was, determined, by, their, scholarly, reputation, the, majority, of, classical, legal, works, written, by, author, jurists, were, based, in, large, part, on, fatwas, of, distinguished, muftis, these, fatwas, functioned, as, a, form, of, legal, precedent, unlike, court, verdicts, which, were, valid, only, for, the, given, case, although, independent, muftis, never, disappeared, from, the, 12th, century, onward, muslim, rulers, began, to, appoint, salaried, muftis, to, answer, questions, from, the, public, over, the, centuries, sunni, muftis, were, gradually, incorporated, into, state, bureaucracies, while, shia, jurists, in, iran, progressively, asserted, an, autonomous, authority, starting, from, the, early, modern, era, islamic, law, was, initially, taught, in, study, circles, that, gathered, in, mosques, and, private, homes, the, teacher, assisted, by, advanced, students, provided, commentary, on, concise, treatises, of, law, and, examined, the, students, understanding, of, the, text, this, tradition, continued, to, be, practiced, in, madrasas, which, spread, during, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, madrasas, were, institutions, of, higher, learning, devoted, principally, to, study, of, law, but, also, offering, other, subjects, such, as, theology, medicine, and, mathematics, the, madrasa, complex, usually, consisted, of, a, mosque, boarding, house, and, a, library, it, was, maintained, by, a, waqf, charitable, endowment, which, paid, salaries, of, professors, stipends, of, students, and, defrayed, the, costs, of, construction, and, maintenance, at, the, end, of, a, course, the, professor, granted, a, license, ijaza, certifying, a, student, s, competence, in, its, subject, matter, students, specializing, in, law, would, complete, a, curriculum, consisting, of, preparatory, studies, the, doctrines, of, a, particular, madhhab, and, training, in, legal, disputation, and, finally, write, a, dissertation, which, earned, them, a, license, to, teach, and, issue, fatwas, a, judge, qadi, was, in, charge, of, the, qadi, s, court, mahkama, also, called, the, sharia, court, qadis, were, trained, in, islamic, law, though, not, necessarily, to, a, level, required, to, issue, fatwas, court, personnel, also, included, a, number, of, assistants, performing, various, roles, judges, were, theoretically, independent, in, their, decisions, though, they, were, appointed, by, the, ruler, and, often, experienced, pressure, from, members, of, the, ruling, elite, where, their, interests, were, at, play, the, role, of, qadis, was, to, evaluate, the, evidence, establish, the, facts, of, the, case, and, issue, a, verdict, based, on, the, applicable, rulings, of, islamic, jurisprudence, the, qadi, was, supposed, to, solicit, a, fatwa, from, a, mufti, if, it, was, unclear, how, the, law, should, be, applied, to, the, case, since, islamic, legal, theory, does, not, recognize, the, distinction, between, private, and, public, law, court, procedures, were, identical, for, civil, and, criminal, cases, and, required, a, private, plaintiff, to, produce, evidence, against, the, defendant, the, main, type, of, evidence, was, oral, witness, testimony, the, standards, of, evidence, for, criminal, cases, were, so, strict, that, a, conviction, was, often, difficult, to, obtain, even, for, apparently, clear, cut, cases, most, historians, believe, that, because, of, these, stringent, procedural, norms, qadi, s, courts, at, an, early, date, lost, their, jurisdiction, over, criminal, cases, which, were, instead, handled, in, other, types, of, courts, if, an, accusation, did, not, result, in, a, verdict, in, a, qadi, s, court, the, plaintiff, could, often, pursue, it, in, another, type, of, court, called, the, mazalim, court, administered, by, the, ruler, s, council, the, rationale, for, mazalim, lit, wrongs, grievances, courts, was, to, address, the, wrongs, that, sharia, courts, were, unable, to, address, including, complaints, against, government, officials, islamic, jurists, were, commonly, in, attendance, and, a, judge, often, presided, over, the, court, as, a, deputy, of, the, ruler, mazalim, verdicts, were, supposed, to, conform, to, the, spirit, of, sharia, but, they, were, not, bound, by, the, letter, of, the, law, or, the, procedural, restrictions, of, qadi, s, courts, the, police, shurta, which, took, initiative, in, preventing, and, investigating, crime, operated, its, own, courts, like, the, mazalim, courts, police, courts, were, not, bound, by, the, rules, of, sharia, and, had, the, powers, to, inflict, discretionary, punishments, another, office, for, maintaining, public, order, was, the, muhtasib, market, inspector, who, was, charged, with, preventing, fraud, in, economic, transactions, and, infractions, against, public, morality, the, muhtasib, took, an, active, role, in, pursuing, these, types, of, offenses, and, meted, out, punishments, based, on, local, custom, the, social, fabric, of, pre, modern, islamic, societies, was, largely, defined, by, close, knit, communities, organized, around, kinship, groups, and, local, neighborhoods, conflicts, between, individuals, had, the, potential, to, escalate, into, a, conflict, between, their, supporting, groups, and, disrupt, the, life, of, the, entire, community, court, litigation, was, seen, as, a, last, resort, for, cases, where, informal, mediation, had, failed, this, attitude, was, reflected, in, the, legal, maxim, amicable, settlement, is, the, best, verdict, al, sulh, sayyid, al, ahkam, in, court, disputes, qadis, were, generally, less, concerned, with, legal, theory, than, with, achieving, an, outcome, that, enabled, the, disputants, to, resume, their, previous, social, relationships, this, could, be, accomplished, by, avoiding, a, total, loss, for, the, losing, side, or, simply, giving, them, a, chance, to, articulate, their, position, in, public, and, obtain, a, measure, of, psychological, vindication, islamic, law, required, judges, to, be, familiar, with, local, customs, and, they, exercised, a, number, of, other, public, functions, in, the, community, including, mediation, and, arbitration, supervision, of, public, works, auditing, waqf, finances, and, looking, after, the, interests, of, orphans, unlike, pre, modern, cultures, where, the, ruling, dynasty, promulgated, the, law, islamic, law, was, formulated, by, religious, scholars, without, involvement, of, the, rulers, the, law, derived, its, authority, not, from, political, control, but, rather, from, the, collective, doctrinal, positions, of, the, legal, schools, madhhabs, in, their, capacity, as, interpreters, of, the, scriptures, the, ulema, religious, scholars, were, involved, in, management, of, communal, affairs, and, acted, as, representatives, of, the, muslim, population, vis, vis, the, ruling, dynasties, who, before, the, modern, era, had, limited, capacity, for, direct, governance, military, elites, relied, on, the, ulema, for, religious, legitimation, with, financial, support, for, religious, institutions, being, one, of, the, principal, means, through, which, these, elites, established, their, legitimacy, in, turn, the, ulema, depended, on, the, support, of, the, ruling, elites, for, the, continuing, operation, of, religious, institutions, although, the, relationship, between, secular, rulers, and, religious, scholars, underwent, a, number, of, shifts, and, transformations, in, different, times, and, places, this, mutual, dependence, characterized, islamic, history, until, the, start, of, the, modern, era, additionally, since, sharia, contained, few, provisions, in, several, areas, of, public, law, muslim, rulers, were, able, to, legislate, various, collections, of, economic, criminal, and, administrative, laws, outside, the, jurisdiction, of, islamic, jurists, the, most, famous, of, which, is, the, qanun, promulgated, by, ottoman, sultans, beginning, from, the, 15th, century, the, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, r, 1658, 1707, issued, a, hybrid, body, of, law, known, as, fatawa, e, alamgiri, based, on, hanafi, fatwas, as, well, as, decisions, of, islamic, courts, and, made, it, applicable, to, all, religious, communities, on, the, indian, subcontinent, this, early, attempt, to, turn, islamic, law, into, semi, codified, state, legislation, sparked, rebellions, against, mughal, rule, in, both, the, rules, of, civil, disputes, and, application, of, penal, law, classical, sharia, distinguishes, between, men, and, women, between, muslims, and, non, muslims, and, between, free, persons, and, slaves, traditional, islamic, law, assumes, a, patriarchal, society, with, a, man, at, the, head, of, the, household, different, legal, schools, formulated, a, variety, of, legal, norms, which, could, be, manipulated, to, the, advantage, of, men, or, women, but, women, were, generally, at, a, disadvantage, with, respect, to, the, rules, of, inheritance, and, witness, testimony, where, in, some, cases, a, woman, s, witness, testimony, is, effectively, treated, as, half, of, that, of, a, man, various, financial, obligations, imposed, on, the, husband, acted, as, a, deterrent, against, unilateral, divorce, and, commonly, gave, the, wife, financial, leverage, in, divorce, proceedings, women, were, active, in, sharia, courts, as, both, plaintiffs, and, defendants, in, a, wide, variety, of, cases, though, some, opted, to, be, represented, by, a, male, relative, sharia, was, intended, to, regulate, affairs, of, the, muslim, community, non, muslims, residing, under, islamic, rule, had, the, legal, status, of, dhimmi, which, entailed, a, number, of, protections, restrictions, freedoms, and, legal, inequalities, including, payment, of, the, jizya, tax, dhimmi, communities, had, legal, autonomy, to, adjudicate, their, internal, affairs, cases, involving, litigants, from, two, different, religious, groups, fell, under, jurisdiction, of, sharia, courts, where, unlike, in, secular, courts, testimony, of, non, muslim, witnesses, against, a, muslim, was, inadmissible, in, criminal, cases, or, at, all, this, legal, framework, was, implemented, with, varying, degree, of, rigor, in, some, periods, or, towns, all, inhabitants, apparently, used, the, same, court, without, regard, for, their, religious, affiliation, the, mughal, emperor, aurangzeb, imposed, islamic, law, on, all, his, subjects, including, provisions, traditionally, applicable, only, to, muslims, while, some, of, his, predecessors, and, successors, are, said, to, have, abolished, jizya, according, to, ottoman, records, non, muslim, women, took, their, cases, to, a, sharia, court, when, they, expected, a, more, favorable, outcome, on, marital, divorce, and, property, questions, than, in, christian, and, jewish, courts, over, time, non, muslims, in, the, ottoman, empire, could, be, more, or, less, likely, to, use, islamic, courts, for, example, in, 1729, at, the, islamic, court, in, galata, only, two, percent, of, cases, involved, non, muslims, whereas, in, 1789, non, muslims, were, a, part, of, thirty, percent, of, cases, ottoman, court, records, also, reflect, the, use, of, islamic, courts, by, formerly, non, muslim, women, as, it, was, illegal, for, non, muslims, to, own, muslims, and, for, non, muslim, men, to, marry, muslim, women, in, the, ottoman, empire, conversion, to, islam, would, have, been, an, option, for, non, muslim, women, to, free, themselves, of, a, spouse, or, master, they, did, not, want, to, subject, to, however, this, would, likely, lead, to, them, being, shunned, by, their, former, community, classical, fiqh, acknowledges, and, regulates, slavery, as, a, legitimate, institution, it, granted, slaves, certain, rights, and, protections, improving, their, status, relative, to, greek, and, roman, law, and, restricted, the, scenarios, under, which, people, could, be, enslaved, however, slaves, could, not, inherit, or, enter, into, a, contract, and, were, subject, to, their, master, s, will, in, a, number, of, ways, the, labor, and, property, of, slaves, were, owned, by, the, master, who, was, also, entitled, to, sexual, submission, of, his, unmarried, slaves, formal, legal, disabilities, for, some, groups, coexisted, with, a, legal, culture, that, viewed, sharia, as, a, reflection, of, universal, principles, of, justice, which, involved, protection, of, the, weak, against, injustices, committed, by, the, strong, this, conception, was, reinforced, by, the, historical, practice, of, sharia, courts, where, peasants, almost, always, won, cases, against, oppressive, landowners, and, non, muslims, often, prevailed, in, disputes, against, muslims, including, such, powerful, figures, as, the, governor, of, their, province, in, family, matters, the, sharia, court, was, seen, as, a, place, where, the, rights, of, women, could, be, asserted, against, their, husband, s, transgressions, starting, from, the, 17th, century, european, powers, began, to, extend, political, influence, over, lands, ruled, by, muslim, dynasties, and, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, much, of, the, muslim, world, came, under, colonial, domination, the, first, areas, of, islamic, law, to, be, impacted, were, usually, commercial, and, criminal, laws, which, impeded, colonial, administration, and, were, soon, replaced, by, european, regulations, islamic, commercial, laws, were, also, replaced, by, european, mostly, french, laws, in, muslim, states, which, retained, formal, independence, because, these, states, increasingly, came, to, rely, on, western, capital, and, could, not, afford, to, lose, the, business, of, foreign, merchants, who, refused, to, submit, to, islamic, regulations, the, first, significant, changes, to, the, legal, system, of, british, india, were, initiated, in, the, late, 18th, century, by, the, governor, of, bengal, warren, hastings, hastings, plan, of, legal, reform, envisioned, a, multi, tiered, court, system, for, the, muslim, population, with, a, middle, tier, of, british, judges, advised, by, local, islamic, jurists, and, a, lower, tier, of, courts, operated, by, qadis, hastings, also, commissioned, a, translation, of, the, classic, manual, of, hanafi, fiqh, al, hidayah, from, arabic, into, persian, and, then, english, later, complemented, by, other, texts, these, translations, enabled, british, judges, to, pass, verdicts, in, the, name, of, islamic, law, based, on, a, combination, of, sharia, rules, and, common, law, doctrines, and, eliminated, the, need, to, rely, on, consultation, by, local, ulema, whom, they, mistrusted, in, the, traditional, islamic, context, a, concise, text, like, al, hidayah, would, be, used, as, a, basis, for, classroom, commentary, by, a, professor, and, the, doctrines, thus, learned, would, be, mediated, in, court, by, judicial, discretion, consideration, of, local, customs, and, availability, of, different, legal, opinions, that, could, fit, the, facts, of, the, case, the, british, use, of, al, hidayah, which, amounted, to, an, inadvertent, codification, of, sharia, and, its, interpretation, by, judges, trained, in, western, legal, traditions, anticipated, later, legal, reforms, in, the, muslim, world, british, administrators, felt, that, sharia, rules, too, often, allowed, criminals, to, escape, punishment, as, exemplified, by, hastings, complaint, that, islamic, law, was, founded, on, the, most, lenient, principles, and, on, an, abhorrence, of, bloodshed, in, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, criminal, laws, and, other, aspects, of, the, islamic, legal, system, in, india, were, supplanted, by, british, law, with, the, exception, of, sharia, rules, retained, in, family, laws, and, some, property, transactions, among, other, changes, these, reforms, brought, about, abolition, of, slavery, prohibition, of, child, marriage, and, a, much, more, frequent, use, of, capital, punishment, the, resulting, legal, system, known, as, anglo, muhammadan, law, was, treated, by, the, british, as, a, model, for, legal, reforms, in, their, other, colonies, like, the, british, in, india, colonial, administrations, typically, sought, to, obtain, precise, and, authoritative, information, about, indigenous, laws, which, prompted, them, to, prefer, classical, islamic, legal, texts, over, local, judicial, practice, this, together, with, their, conception, of, islamic, law, as, a, collection, of, inflexible, rules, led, to, an, emphasis, on, traditionalist, forms, of, sharia, that, were, not, rigorously, applied, in, the, pre, colonial, period, and, served, as, a, formative, influence, on, the, modern, identity, politics, of, the, muslim, world, during, the, colonial, era, muslim, rulers, concluded, that, they, could, not, resist, european, pressure, unless, they, modernized, their, armies, and, built, centrally, administered, states, along, the, lines, of, western, models, in, the, ottoman, empire, the, first, such, changes, in, the, legal, sphere, involved, placing, the, formerly, independent, waqfs, under, state, control, this, reform, passed, in, 1826, enriched, the, public, treasury, at, the, expense, of, the, waqfs, thereby, depleting, the, financial, support, for, traditional, islamic, legal, education, over, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, a, new, hierarchical, system, of, secular, courts, was, established, to, supplement, and, eventually, replace, most, religious, courts, students, hoping, to, pursue, legal, careers, in, the, new, court, system, increasingly, preferred, attending, secular, schools, over, the, traditional, path, of, legal, education, with, its, dimming, financial, prospects, the, tanzimat, reforms, of, the, 19th, century, saw, reorganization, of, both, islamic, civil, law, and, sultanic, criminal, law, after, the, model, of, the, napoleonic, code, in, the, 1870s, a, codification, of, civil, law, and, procedure, excepting, marriage, and, divorce, called, the, mecelle, was, produced, for, use, in, both, sharia, and, secular, courts, it, adopted, the, turkish, language, for, the, benefit, of, the, new, legal, class, who, no, longer, possessed, competence, in, the, arabic, idiom, of, traditional, jurisprudence, the, code, was, based, on, hanafi, law, and, its, authors, selected, minority, opinions, over, authoritative, ones, when, they, were, felt, to, better, suit, the, present, conditions, the, mecelle, was, promulgated, as, a, qanun, sultanic, code, which, represented, an, unprecedented, assertion, of, the, state, s, authority, over, islamic, civil, law, traditionally, the, preserve, of, the, ulema, the, 1917, ottoman, law, of, family, rights, adopted, an, innovative, approach, of, drawing, rules, from, minority, and, majority, opinions, of, all, sunni, madhhabs, with, a, modernizing, intent, the, republic, of, turkey, which, emerged, after, the, dissolution, of, the, ottoman, empire, abolished, its, sharia, courts, and, replaced, ottoman, civil, laws, with, the, swiss, civil, code, but, ottoman, civil, laws, remained, in, force, for, several, decades, in, jordan, lebanon, palestine, syria, and, iraq, westernization, of, legal, institutions, and, expansion, of, state, control, in, all, areas, of, law, which, began, during, the, colonial, era, continued, in, nation, states, of, the, muslim, world, sharia, courts, at, first, continued, to, exist, alongside, state, courts, as, in, earlier, times, but, the, doctrine, that, sultanic, courts, should, implement, the, ideals, of, sharia, was, gradually, replaced, by, legal, norms, imported, from, europe, court, procedures, were, also, brought, in, line, with, european, practice, though, the, islamic, terms, qadi, and, mahkama, qadi, s, sharia, court, were, preserved, they, generally, came, to, mean, judge, and, court, in, the, western, sense, while, in, the, traditional, sharia, court, all, parties, represented, themselves, in, modern, courts, they, are, represented, by, professional, lawyers, educated, in, western, style, law, schools, and, the, verdicts, are, subject, to, review, in, an, appeals, court, in, the, 20th, century, most, countries, abolished, a, parallel, system, of, sharia, courts, and, brought, all, cases, under, a, national, civil, court, system, in, most, muslim, majority, countries, traditional, rules, of, classical, fiqh, have, been, largely, preserved, only, in, family, law, in, some, countries, religious, minorities, such, as, christians, or, shia, muslims, have, been, subject, to, separate, systems, of, family, laws, many, muslims, today, believe, that, contemporary, sharia, based, laws, are, an, authentic, representation, of, the, pre, modern, legal, tradition, in, reality, they, generally, represent, the, result, of, extensive, legal, reforms, made, in, the, modern, era, as, traditional, islamic, jurists, lost, their, role, as, authoritative, interpreters, of, the, laws, applied, in, courts, these, laws, were, codified, by, legislators, and, administered, by, state, systems, which, employed, a, number, of, devices, to, effect, changes, including, the, most, powerful, influence, on, liberal, reformist, thought, came, from, the, work, of, the, egyptian, islamic, scholar, muhammad, abduh, 1849, 1905, abduh, viewed, only, sharia, rules, pertaining, to, religious, rituals, as, inflexible, and, argued, that, the, other, islamic, laws, should, be, adapted, based, on, changing, circumstances, in, consideration, of, social, well, being, following, precedents, of, earlier, islamic, thinkers, he, advocated, restoring, islam, to, its, original, purity, by, returning, to, the, quran, and, the, sunna, instead, of, following, the, medieval, schools, of, jurisprudence, he, championed, a, creative, approach, to, ijtihad, that, involved, direct, interpretation, of, scriptures, as, well, as, the, methods, of, takhayyur, and, talfiq, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, in, modern, legal, reforms, was, the, egyptian, legal, scholar, abd, el, razzak, el, sanhuri, 1895, 1971, who, possessed, expertise, in, both, islamic, and, western, law, sanhuri, argued, that, reviving, islamic, legal, heritage, in, a, way, that, served, the, needs, of, contemporary, society, required, its, analysis, in, light, of, the, modern, science, of, comparative, law, he, drafted, the, civil, codes, of, egypt, 1949, and, iraq, 1951, based, on, a, variety, of, sources, including, classical, fiqh, european, laws, existing, arab, and, turkish, codes, and, the, history, of, local, court, decisions, sanhuri, s, egyptian, code, incorporated, few, classical, sharia, rules, but, he, drew, on, traditional, jurisprudence, more, frequently, for, the, iraqi, code, sanhuri, s, codes, were, subsequently, adopted, in, some, form, by, most, arab, countries, aside, from, the, radical, reforms, of, islamic, family, law, carried, out, in, tunisia, 1956, and, iran, 1967, governments, often, preferred, to, make, changes, that, made, a, clear, break, from, traditional, sharia, rules, by, imposing, administrative, hurdles, rather, than, changing, the, rules, themselves, in, order, to, minimize, objections, from, religious, conservatives, various, procedural, changes, have, been, made, in, a, number, of, countries, to, restrict, polygamy, give, women, greater, rights, in, divorce, and, eliminate, child, marriage, inheritance, has, been, the, legal, domain, least, susceptible, to, reform, as, legislators, have, been, generally, reluctant, to, tamper, with, the, highly, technical, system, of, quranic, shares, some, reforms, have, faced, strong, conservative, opposition, for, example, the, 1979, reform, of, egyptian, family, law, promulgated, by, anwar, sadat, through, presidential, decree, provoked, an, outcry, and, was, annulled, in, 1985, by, the, supreme, court, on, procedural, grounds, to, be, later, replaced, by, a, compromise, version, the, 2003, reform, of, moroccan, family, law, which, sought, to, reconcile, universal, human, rights, norms, and, the, country, s, islamic, heritage, was, drafted, by, a, commission, that, included, parliamentarians, religious, scholars, and, feminist, activists, and, the, result, has, been, praised, by, international, rights, groups, as, an, example, of, progressive, legislation, achieved, within, an, islamic, framework, political, militant, islam, portal, the, islamic, revival, of, the, late, 20th, century, brought, the, topic, of, sharia, to, international, attention, in, the, form, of, numerous, political, campaigns, in, the, muslim, world, calling, for, full, implementation, of, sharia, a, number, of, factors, have, contributed, to, the, rise, of, these, movements, classified, under, the, rubric, of, islamism, or, political, islam, including, the, failure, of, authoritarian, secular, regimes, to, meet, the, expectations, of, their, citizens, and, a, desire, of, muslim, populations, to, return, to, more, culturally, authentic, forms, of, socio, political, organization, in, the, face, of, a, perceived, cultural, invasion, from, the, west, shiite, leaders, such, as, ayatollah, khomeini, drew, on, leftist, anticolonialist, rhetoric, by, framing, their, call, for, sharia, as, a, resistance, struggle, they, accused, secular, leaders, of, corruption, and, predatory, behavior, and, claimed, that, a, return, to, sharia, would, replace, despotic, rulers, with, pious, leaders, striving, for, social, and, economic, justice, in, the, arab, world, these, positions, are, often, encapsulated, in, the, slogan, islam, is, the, solution, al, islam, huwa, al, hall, full, implementation, of, sharia, theoretically, refers, to, expanding, its, scope, to, all, fields, of, law, and, all, areas, of, public, life, in, practice, islamization, campaigns, have, focused, on, a, few, highly, visible, issues, associated, with, the, conservative, muslim, identity, particularly, women, s, hijab, and, the, hudud, criminal, punishments, whipping, stoning, and, amputation, prescribed, for, certain, crimes, for, many, islamists, hudud, punishments, are, at, the, core, of, the, divine, sharia, because, they, are, specified, by, the, letter, of, scripture, rather, than, by, human, interpreters, modern, islamists, have, often, rejected, at, least, in, theory, the, stringent, procedural, constraints, developed, by, classical, jurists, to, restrict, their, application, to, the, broader, muslim, public, the, calls, for, sharia, often, represent, even, more, than, any, specific, demands, a, vague, vision, of, their, current, economic, and, political, situation, being, replaced, by, a, just, utopia, a, number, of, legal, reforms, have, been, made, under, the, influence, of, these, movements, starting, from, the, 1970s, when, egypt, and, syria, amended, their, constitutions, to, specify, sharia, as, the, basis, of, legislation, the, iranian, revolution, of, 1979, represented, a, watershed, for, shiism, advocates, demonstrating, that, it, was, possible, to, replace, a, secular, regime, with, a, theocracy, several, countries, including, iran, pakistan, sudan, and, some, nigerian, states, have, incorporated, hudud, rules, into, their, criminal, justice, systems, which, however, retained, fundamental, influences, of, earlier, westernizing, reforms, in, practice, these, changes, were, largely, symbolic, and, aside, from, some, cases, brought, to, trial, to, demonstrate, that, the, new, rules, were, being, enforced, hudud, punishments, tended, to, fall, into, disuse, sometimes, to, be, revived, depending, on, the, local, political, climate, the, supreme, courts, of, sudan, and, iran, have, rarely, approved, verdicts, of, stoning, or, amputation, and, the, supreme, courts, of, pakistan, and, nigeria, have, never, done, so, nonetheless, islamization, campaigns, have, also, had, repercussions, in, several, other, areas, of, law, leading, to, curtailment, of, rights, of, women, and, religious, minorities, and, in, the, case, of, sudan, contributing, to, the, breakout, of, a, civil, war, advocates, of, islamization, have, often, been, more, concerned, with, ideology, than, traditional, jurisprudence, and, there, is, no, agreement, among, them, as, to, what, form, a, modern, sharia, based, islamic, state, should, take, this, is, particularly, the, case, for, the, theorists, of, islamic, economics, and, islamic, finance, who, have, advocated, both, free, market, and, socialist, economic, models, the, notion, of, sharia, compliant, finance, has, become, an, active, area, of, doctrinal, innovation, and, its, development, has, had, a, major, impact, on, business, operations, around, the, world, according, to, human, rights, groups, some, of, the, classical, sharia, practices, involve, serious, violations, of, basic, human, rights, gender, equality, and, freedom, of, expression, and, the, practices, of, countries, governed, by, sharia, are, criticized, the, european, court, of, human, rights, in, strasbourg, ecthr, ruled, in, several, cases, that, sharia, is, incompatible, with, the, fundamental, principles, of, democracy, human, rights, concept, have, been, categorically, excluded, by, the, governments, of, countries, such, as, iran, and, saudi, arabia, under, sharia, claiming, that, it, belongs, to, secular, and, western, values, while, the, cairo, conference, by, the, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, declared, that, human, rights, can, only, be, respected, if, they, are, compatible, with, islam, the, legal, systems, of, most, muslim, majority, countries, can, be, classified, as, either, secular, or, mixed, sharia, plays, no, role, in, secular, legal, systems, in, mixed, legal, systems, sharia, rules, are, allowed, to, influence, some, national, laws, which, are, codified, and, may, be, based, on, european, or, indian, models, and, the, central, legislative, role, is, played, by, politicians, and, modern, jurists, rather, than, the, ulema, traditional, islamic, scholars, saudi, arabia, and, some, other, persian, gulf, states, possess, what, may, be, called, classical, sharia, systems, where, national, law, is, largely, uncodified, and, formally, equated, with, sharia, with, ulema, playing, a, decisive, role, in, its, interpretation, iran, has, adopted, some, features, of, classical, sharia, systems, while, also, maintaining, characteristics, of, mixed, systems, like, codified, laws, and, a, parliament, constitutions, of, many, muslim, majority, countries, refer, to, sharia, as, a, source, or, the, main, source, of, law, though, these, references, are, not, in, themselves, indicative, of, how, much, the, legal, system, is, influenced, by, sharia, and, whether, the, influence, has, a, traditionalist, or, modernist, character, the, same, constitutions, usually, also, refer, to, universal, principles, such, as, democracy, and, human, rights, leaving, it, up, to, legislators, and, the, judiciary, to, work, out, how, these, norms, are, to, be, reconciled, in, practice, conversely, some, countries, e, g, algeria, whose, constitution, does, not, mention, sharia, possess, sharia, based, family, laws, nisrine, abiad, identifies, bahrain, iran, pakistan, and, saudi, arabia, as, states, with, strong, constitutional, consequences, of, sharia, on, the, organization, and, functioning, of, power, except, for, secular, systems, muslim, majority, countries, possess, sharia, based, laws, dealing, with, family, matters, marriage, inheritance, etc, these, laws, generally, reflect, influence, of, various, modern, era, reforms, and, tend, to, be, characterized, by, ambiguity, with, traditional, and, modernist, interpretations, often, manifesting, themselves, in, the, same, country, both, in, legislation, and, court, decisions, in, some, countries, e, g, parts, of, nigeria, people, can, choose, whether, to, pursue, a, case, in, a, sharia, or, secular, court,

has, never, adopted, a, criminal, code, and, saudi, judges, still, follow, traditional, hanbali, jurisprudence, in, the, course, of, islamization, campaigns, several, countries, libya, pakistan, iran, sudan, mauritania, and, yemen, inserted, islamic, criminal, laws, into, their, penal, codes, which, were, otherwise, based, on, western, models, in, some, countries, only, hudud, penalties, were, added, while, others, also, enacted, provisions, for, qisas, law, of, retaliation, and, diya, monetary, compensation, iran, subsequently, issued, a, new, islamic, penal, code, the, criminal, codes, of, afghanistan, and, united, arab, emirates, contain, a, general, provision, that, certain, crimes, are, to, be, punished, according, to, islamic, law, without, specifying, the, penalties, some, nigerian, states, have, also, enacted, islamic, criminal, laws, laws, in, the, indonesian, province, of, aceh, provide, for, application, of, discretionary, ta, zir, punishments, for, violation, of,

to, the, popular, misconception, of, the, fatwa, as, a, religious, death, warrant, modern, fatwas, have, been, marked, by, an, increased, reliance, on, the, process, of, ijtihad, i, e, deriving,

do, not, possess, the, qualifications, traditionally, required, of, a, mufti, the, most, notorious, examples, are, the, fatwas, of, militant, extremists, when, osama, bin, laden, and, his, associates, issued, a, fatwa, in, 1998, proclaiming, jihad, against, jews, and, crusaders, many, islamic, jurists, in, addition, to, denouncing, its, content, stressed, that, bin, laden, was, not, qualified, to, either, issue, a, fatwa, or, proclaim, a, jihad, new, forms, of, ijtihad, have, also, given, rise, to, fatwas, that, support, such, notions, as, gender, equality, and, banking, interest, which, are, at, variance, with, classical, jurisprudence, in, the, internet, age, a, large, number, of, websites, provide, fatwas, in, response, to, queries, from, around, the, world, in, addition, to, radio, shows, and, satellite, television, programs, offering, call, in, fatwas, erroneous, and, sometimes, bizarre, fatwas, issued, by, unqualified, or, eccentric, individuals, in, recent, times, have, sometimes, given, rise, to, complaints, about, a, chaos, in, the, modern, practice, of, issuing, fatwas, there, exists, no, international, islamic, authority, to, settle, differences, in, interpretation, of, islamic, law, an, international, islamic, fiqh, academy, was, created, by, the, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, but, its, legal, opinions, are, not, binding, the, vast, amount, of, fatwas, produced, in, the, modern, world, attests, to, the, importance, of, islamic, authenticity, to, many, muslims, however, there, is, little, research, available, to, indicate, to, what, extent, muslims, acknowledge, the, authority, of, different, muftis, or, heed, their, rulings, in, real, life, the, classical, doctrine, of, hisba, associated, with, the, quranic, injunction, of, enjoining, good, and, forbidding, wrong, refers, to, the, duty, of, muslims, to, promote, moral, rectitude, and, intervene, when, another, muslim, is, acting, wrongly, historically, its, legal, implementation, was, entrusted, to, a, public, official, called, muhtasib, market, inspector, who, was, charged, with, preventing, fraud, disturbance, of, public, order, and, infractions, against, public, morality, this, office, disappeared, in, the, modern, era, everywhere, in, the, muslim, world, but, it, was, revived, in, arabia, by, the, first, saudi, state, and, later, instituted, as, a, government, committee, responsible, for, supervising, markets, and, public, order, it, has, been, aided, by, volunteers, enforcing, attendance, of, daily, prayers, gender, segregation, in, public, places, and, a, conservative, notion, of, hijab, committee, officers, were, authorized, to, detain, violators, before, a, 2016, reform, with, the, rising, international, influence, of, wahhabism, the, conception, of, hisba, as, an, individual, obligation, to, police, religious, observance, has, become, more, widespread, which, led, to, the, appearance, of, activists, around, the, world, who, urge, fellow, muslims, to, observe, islamic, rituals, dress, code, and, other, aspects, of, sharia, in, iran, hisba, was, enshrined, in, the, constitution, after, the, 1979, revolution, as, a, universal, and, reciprocal, duty, incumbent, upon, both, the, government, and, the, people, its, implementation, has, been, carried, out, by, official, committees, as, well, as, volunteer, forces, basij,

other, segments, of, the, population, especially, liberals, urban, women, and, younger, people, in, egypt, a, law, based, on, the, doctrine, of, hisba, had, for, a, time, allowed, a, muslim, to, sue, another, muslim, over, beliefs, that, may, harm, society, though, because, of, abuses, it, has, been, amended, so, that, only, the, state, prosecutor, may, bring, suit, based, on, private, requests, before, the, amendment, was, passed, a, hisba, suit, brought, by, a, group, of, islamists, against, the, liberal, theologian, nasr, abu, zayd, on, charges, of, apostasy, led, to, the, annulment, of, his, marriage, the, law, was, also, invoked, in, an, unsuccessful, blasphemy, suit, against, the, feminist, author, nawal, el, saadawi, hisba, has, also, been, invoked, in, several, muslim, majority, countries, as, rationale, for, blocking, pornographic, content, on, the, internet, and, for, other, forms, of, faith, based, censorship, sharia, also, plays, a, role, beyond, religious, rituals, and, personal, ethics, in, some, countries, with, muslim, minorities, for, example, in, israel, sharia, based, family, laws, are, administered, for, the, muslim, population, by, the, ministry, of, justice,

survey, based, on, interviews, of, 38, 000, muslims, randomly, selected, from, urban, and, rural, parts, in, 39, countries, using, area, probability, designs, by, the, pew, forum, on, religion, and, public, life, found, that, a, majority, in, some, cases, overwhelming, majority, of, muslims, in, a, number, of, countries, support, making, sharia, or, islamic, law, the, law, of, the, land, including, afghanistan, 99, iraq, 91, niger, 86, malaysia, 86, pakistan, 84, morocco, 83, bangladesh, 82, egypt, 74, indonesia, 72, jordan, 71, uganda, 66, ethiopia, 65, mali, 63, ghana, 58, and,

supported, application, of, severe, punishments, such, as, whippings, and, cutting, off, hands, and, interpretations, of, some, aspects, differed, widely, according, to, the, pew, poll, among, muslims, who, support, making, sharia, the, law, of, the, land, most, do, not, believe, that, it, should, be, applied, to, non, muslims, in, the, muslim, majority, countries, surveyed, this, proportion, varied, between, 74, of, 74, in, egypt, and, 19, of, 10, in, kazakhstan, as, percentage, of, those, who, favored, making, sharia, the, law, of, the, land, in, all, of, the, countries, surveyed, respondents, were, more, likely, to, define, sharia, as, the, revealed, word, of, god, rather, than, as, a, body, of, law, developed, by, men, based, on, the, word, of, god, in, analyzing, the, poll, amaney, jamal, has, argued, that, there, is, no, single, shared, understanding, of, the, notions, sharia, and, islamic, law, among, the, respondents, in, particular, in, countries, where, muslim, citizens, have, little, experience, with, rigid, application, of, sharia, based, state, laws, these, notions, tend, to, be, more, associated, with, islamic, ideals, like, equality, and, social, justice, than, with, prohibitions, other, polls, have, indicated, that, for, egyptians, the, word, sharia, is, associated, with, notions, of, political, social, and, gender, justice, in, 2008, rowan, williams, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, has, suggested, that, islamic, and, orthodox, jewish, courts, should, be, integrated, into, the, british, legal, system, alongside, ecclesiastical, courts, to, handle, marriage, and, divorce, subject, to, agreement, of, all, parties, and, strict, requirements, for, protection, of, equal, rights, for, women, his, reference, to, the, sharia, sparked, a, controversy, later, that, year, nicholas, phillips, then, lord, chief, justice, of, england, and, wales, stated, that, there, was, no, reason, why, sharia, principles, should, not, be, the, basis, for, mediation, or, other, forms, of, alternative, dispute, resolution, a, 2008, yougov, poll, in, the, united, kingdom, found, 40, of, muslim, students, interviewed, supported, the, introduction, of, sharia, into, british, law, for, muslims, michael, broyde, professor, of, law, at, emory, university, specializing, in, alternative, dispute, resolution, and, jewish, law, has, argued, that, sharia, courts, can, be, integrated, into, the, american, religious, arbitration, system, provided, that, they, adopt, appropriate, institutional, requirements, as, american, rabbinical, courts, have, done, in, the, western, world, sharia, has, been, called, a, source, of, hysteria, more, controversial, than, ever, the, one, aspect, of, islam, that, inspires, particular, dread, on, the, internet, dozens, of, self, styled, counter, jihadis, emerged, to, campaign, against, sharia, law, describing, it, in, strict, interpretations, resembling, those, of, salafi, muslims, also, fear, of, sharia, law, and, of, the, ideology, of, extremism, among, muslims, as, well, as, certain, congregations, donating, money, to, terrorist, organizations, within, the, muslim, community, reportedly,

liberty, versus, sharia, was, called, a, momentous, civilisational, debate, by, right, wing, pundit, diana, west, in, 2008, in, britain, the, future, prime, minister, david, cameron, declared, his, opposition, to, any, expansion, of, sharia, law, in, the, uk, in, germany, in, 2014, the, interior, minister, thomas, de, maizi, re, told, a, newspaper, bild, sharia, law, is, not, tolerated, on, german, soil, some, countries, and, jurisdictions, have, explicit, bans, on, sharia, law, in, canada, for, example, sharia, law, has, been, explicitly, banned, in, quebec, by, a, 2005, unanimous, vote, of, the, national, assembly, while, the, province, of, ontario, allows, family, law, disputes, to, be, arbitrated, only, under, ontario, law, in, the, u, s, opponents, of, sharia, have, sought, to, ban, it, from, being, considered, in, courts, where, it, has, been, routinely, used, alongside, traditional, jewish, and, catholic, laws, to, decide, legal, business, and, family, disputes, subject, to, contracts, drafted, with, reference, to, such, laws, as, long, as, they, do, not, violate, secular, law, or, the, u, s, constitution, after, failing, to, gather, support, for, a, federal, law, making, observing, sharia, a, felony, punishable, by, up, to, 20, years, in, prison, anti, sharia, activists, have, focused, on, state, legislatures, by, 2014, bills, aimed, against, use, of, sharia, have, been, introduced, in, 34, states, and, passed, in, 11, a, notable, example, of, this, would, be, 2010, oklahoma, state, question, 755, which, sought, to, permanently, ban, the, use, of, sharia, law, in, courts, while, approved, by, voters, the, tenth, circuit, court, of, appeals, placed, an, injunction, on, the, law, citing, the, unconstitutionality, of, the, law, s, impartial, focus, on, a, specific, religion, the, law, was, struck, down, and, never, took, effect, these, bills, have, generally, referred, to, banning, foreign, or, religious, law, in, order, to, thwart, legal, challenges, according, to, jan, michiel, otto, professor, of, law, and, governance, in, developing, countries, at, leiden, university, nthropological, research, shows, that, people, in, local, communities, often, do, not, distinguish, clearly, whether, and, to, what, extent, their, norms, and, practices, are, based, on, local, tradition, tribal, custom, or, religion, those, who, adhere, to, a, confrontational, view, of, sharia, tend, to, ascribe, many, undesirable, practices, to, sharia, and, religion, overlooking, custom, and, culture, even, if, high, ranking, religious, authorities, have, stated, the, opposite, it, has, been, argued, that, the, extent, to, which, sharia, is, compatible, with, democracy, depends, on, how, it, is, culturally, interpreted, with, a, cultural, position, that, sharia, represents, the, human, attempt, to, interpret, god, s, message, associated, with, a, greater, preference, for, democracy, than, an, islamist, interpretation, that, sharia, law, is, the, literal, word, of, god, scholars, john, l, esposito, and, delong, bas, distinguish, four, attitudes, toward, sharia, and, democracy, prominent, among, contemporary, muslims, according, to, polls, conducted, by, gallup, and, pew, in, muslim, majority, countries, most, muslims, see, no, contradiction, between, democratic, values, and, religious, principles, desiring, neither, a, theocracy, nor, a, secular, democracy, but, rather, a, political, model, where, democratic, institutions, and, values, can, coexist, with, the, values, and, principles, of, sharia, muslih, and, browers, identify, three, major, perspectives, on, democracy, among, prominent, muslims, thinkers, who, have, sought, to, develop, modern, distinctly, islamic, theories, of, socio, political, organization, conforming, to, islamic, values, and, law, in, 1998, the, constitutional, court, of, turkey, banned, and, dissolved, turkey, s, refah, party, over, its, announced, intention, to, introduce, sharia, based, laws, ruling, that, it, would, change, turkey, s, secular, order, and, undermine, democracy, on, appeal, by, refah, the, european, court, of, human, rights, determined, that, sharia, is, incompatible, with, the, fundamental, principles, of, democracy, refah, s, sharia, based, notion, of, a, plurality, of, legal, systems, grounded, on, religion, was, ruled, to, contravene, the, european, convention, for, the, protection, of, human, rights, and, fundamental, freedoms, it, was, determined, that, it, would, do, away, with, the, state, s, role, as, the, guarantor, of, individual, rights, and, freedoms, and, infringe, the, principle, of, non, discrimination, between, individuals, as, regards, their, enjoyment, of, public, freedoms, which, is, one, of, the, fundamental, principles, of, democracy, in, an, analysis, maurits, s, berger, found, the, ruling, to, be, nebulous, and, surprising, from, a, legal, point, of, view, since, the, court, neglected, to, define, what, it, meant, by, sharia, and, would, not, for, example, be, expected, to, regard, sharia, rules, for, islamic, rituals, as, contravening, european, human, rights, values, kevin, boyle, also, criticized, the, decision, for, not, distinguishing, between, extremist, and, mainstream, interpretations, of, islam, and, implying, that, peaceful, advocacy, of, islamic, doctrines, an, attitude, which, fails, to, respect, is, not, protected, by, the, european, convention, provisions, for, freedom, of, religion, governments, of, several, predominantly, muslim, countries, have, criticized, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, udhr, for, its, perceived, failure, to, take, into, account, the, cultural, and, religious, context, of, non, western, countries, iran, declared, in, the, un, assembly, that, udhr, was, a, secular, understanding, of, the, judeo, christian, tradition, which, could, not, be, implemented, by, muslims, without, trespassing, the, islamic, law, islamic, scholars, and, islamist, political, parties, consider, universal, human, rights, arguments, as, imposition, of, a, non, muslim, culture, on, muslim, people, a, disrespect, of, customary, cultural, practices, and, of, islam, in, 1990, the, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, a, group, representing, all, muslim, majority, nations, met, in, cairo, to, respond, to, the, udhr, then, adopted, the, cairo, declaration, on, human, rights, in, islam, ann, elizabeth, mayer, points, to, notable, absences, from, the, cairo, declaration, provisions, for, democratic, principles,

criticism, of, the, cairo, declaration, in, an, editorial, we, are, deeply, concerned, with, the, changes, to, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, by, a, coalition, of, islamic, states, within, the, united, nations, that, wishes, to, prohibit, any, criticism, of, religion, and, would, thus, protect, islam, s, limited, view, of, human, rights, in, view, of, the, conditions, inside, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, egypt, pakistan, saudi, arabia, the, sudan, syria, bangladesh, iraq, and, afghanistan, we, should, expect, that, at, the, top, of, their, human, rights, agenda, would, be, to, rectify, the, legal, inequality, of, women, the, suppression, of, political, dissent, the, curtailment, of, free, expression, the, persecution, of, ethnic, minorities, and, religious, dissenters, in, short, protecting, their, citizens, from, egregious, human, rights, violations, instead, they, are, worrying, about, protecting, islam, h, patrick, glenn, states, that, sharia, is, structured, around, the, concept, of, mutual, obligations, of, a, collective, and, it, considers, individual, human, rights, as, potentially, disruptive, and, unnecessary, to, its, revealed, code, of, mutual, obligations, in, giving, priority, to, this, religious, collective, rather, than, individual, liberty, the, islamic, law, justifies, the, formal, inequality, of, individuals, women, non,

sacred, in, islam, including, denying, one, of, the, islamic, prophets, or, scriptures, insulting, an, angel, or, refusing, to, accept, a, religious, commandment, jurists, of, different, schools, prescribed, different, punishment, for, blasphemy, against, islam, by, muslims, and, non, muslims, ranging, from, imprisonment, or, fines, to, the, death, penalty, in, some, cases, sharia, allows, non, muslims, to, escape, death, by, converting, and, becoming, a, devout, follower, of, islam, in, the, modern, muslim, world, the, laws, pertaining, to, blasphemy, vary, by, country, and, some, countries, prescribe, punishments, consisting, of, fines, imprisonment, flogging, hanging, or, beheading, blasphemy, laws, were, rarely, enforced, in, pre, modern, islamic, societies, but, in, the, modern, era, some, states, and, radical, groups, have, used, charges, of, blasphemy, in, an, effort, to, burnish, their, religious, credentials, and, gain, popular, support, at, the, expense, of, liberal, muslim, intellectuals, and, religious, minorities, blasphemy, as, interpreted, under, sharia, is, controversial, representatives, of, the, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, have, petitioned, the, united, nations, to, condemn, defamation, of, religions, because, unrestricted, and, disrespectful, freedom, of, opinion, creates, hatred, and, is, contrary, to, the, spirit, of,

of, them, ahmadis, and, christians, while, none, have, been, legally, executed, two, pakistani, politicians, shahbaz, bhatti, and, salmaan, taseer, have, been, assassinated, over, their, criticism, of, the, blasphemy, laws, the, pakistani, blasphemy, laws, are, based, upon, colonial, era, legislation, which, made, it, a, crime, to, disturb, a, religious, assembly, trespass, on, burial, grounds, insult, religious, beliefs, or, intentionally, destroy, or, defile, a, place, or, an, object, of, worship, with, these, laws, being, modified, between, 1980, and, 1986, by, the, military, government, of, general, zia, ul, haq, to, make, them, more, severe, a, number, of, clauses, were, added, by, the, government, in, order, to, islamicise, the, laws, and, deny, the, muslim, character, of, the, ahmadi, minority, according, to, the, classical, doctrine, apostasy, from, islam, is, a, crime, as, well, as, a, sin, and, can, be, punished, with, the, death, penalty, typically, after, a, waiting, period, to, allow, the, apostate, time, to, repent, and, to, return, to, islam, wael, hallaq, writes, that, a, culture, whose, lynchpin, is, religion, religious, principles, and, religious, morality, apostasy, is, in, some, way, equivalent, to, high, treason, in, the, modern, nation, state, early, islamic, jurists, set, the, standard, for, apostasy, from, islam, so, high, that, practically, no, apostasy, verdict, could, be, passed, before, the, 11th, century, but, later, jurists, lowered, the, bar, for, applying, the, death, penalty, allowing, judges, to, interpret, the, apostasy, law, in, different, ways, which, they, did, sometimes, leniently, and, sometimes, strictly, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, use, of, criminal, penalties, for, apostasy, fell, into, disuse, although, civil, penalties, were, still, applied, according, to, abdul, rashied, omar, the, majority, of, modern, islamic, jurists, continue, to, regard, apostasy, as, a, crime, deserving, the, death, penalty, this, view, is, dominant, in, conservative, societies, like, saudi, arabia, and, pakistan, a, number, of, liberal, and, progressive, islamic, scholars, have, argued, that, apostasy, should, not, be, viewed, as, a, crime, others, argue, that, the, death, penalty, is, an, inappropriate, punishment, inconsistent, with, the, qur, anic, verses, such, as, no, compulsion, in, religion, or, that, it, was, a, man, made, rule, enacted, in, the, early, islamic, community, to, prevent, and, punish, the, equivalent, of, desertion, or, treason, and, should, be, enforced, only, if, apostasy, becomes, a, mechanism, of, public, disobedience, and, disorder, fitna, according, to, khaled, abou, el, fadl, moderate, muslims, do, not, believe, that, apostasy, requires, punishment, the, death, penalty, or, other, punishment, for, apostasy, in, islam, is, a, violation, of, universal, human, rights, and, an, issue, of, freedom, of, faith, and, conscience, twenty, three, muslim, majority, countries, as,

one, in, saudi, arabia, in, 1992, while, modern, states, have, rarely, prosecuted, apostasy, the, issue, has, a, deep, cultural, resonance, in, some, muslim, societies, and, islamists, have, tended, to, exploit, it, for, political, gain, in, a, 2008, 2012, pew, research, center, poll, public, support, for, capital, punishment, for, apostasy, among, muslims, ranged, from, 78, in, afghanistan, to,

according, to, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, owing, in, part, to, stringent, procedural, requirements, for, their, harsher, hudud, forms, and, in, part, to, prevailing, social, tolerance, toward, same, sex, relationships, historical, instances, of, prosecution, for, homosexual, acts, are, rare, and, those, which, followed, sharia, rules, are, even, rarer, public, attitudes, toward, homosexuality, in, the, muslim, world, turned, more, negative, starting, from, the, 19th, century, through, the, gradual, spread, of, islamic, fundamentalist, movements, such, as, salafism, and, wahhabism, and, under, the, influence, of, sexual, notions, prevalent, in, europe, at, that, time, a, number, of, muslim, majority, countries, have, retained, criminal, penalties, for, homosexual,

certain, legal, rights, such, as, property, rights, which, women, in, the, west, did, not, possess, until, comparatively, recent, times, starting, with, the, 20th, century, western, legal, systems, evolved, to, expand, women, s, rights, but, women, s, rights, in, the, muslim, world, have, to, varying, degree, remained, tied, to, the, quran, hadiths, and, their, traditional, interpretations, by, islamic, jurists, sharia, grants, women, the, right, to, inherit, property, from, other, family, members, and, these, rights, are, detailed, in, the, quran, a, woman, s, inheritance, can, be, unequal,

scholar, from, the, second, generation, of, muslims, ata, bin, abi, rabah, counseled, a, husband, not, to, beat, his, wife, even, if, she, ignored, him, but, rather, to, express, his, anger, in, some, other, way, darimi, a, teacher, of, both, tirmidhi, and, muslim, bin, hajjaj, as, well, as, a, leading, early, scholar, in, iran, collected, all, the, hadiths, showing, muhammad, s, disapproval, of, beating, in, a, chapter, entitled, the, prohibition, on, striking, women, a, thirteenth, century, scholar, from, granada, ibn, faras, notes, that, one, camp, of, ulama, had, staked, out, a, stance, forbidding, striking, a, wife, altogether, declaring, it, contrary, to, the, prophet, s, example, and, denying, the, authenticity, of, any, hadiths, that, seemed, to, permit, beating, even, ibn, hajar, the, pillar, of, late, medieval, sunni, hadith, scholarship, concludes, that, contrary, to, what, seems, to, be, an, explicit, command, in, the, qur, an, the, hadiths, of, the, prophet, leave, no, doubt, that, striking, one, s, wife, to, discipline, her, actually, falls, under, the, shariah, ruling, of, strongly, disliked, or, disliked, verging, on, prohibited, the, surah, 4, 34, in, the,

domestic, violence, against, women, when, a, husband, suspects, nushuz, disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill, conduct, in, his, wife, only, after, admonishing, and, staying, away, from, the, bed, does, not, work, these, interpretations, have, been, criticized, as, inconsistent, with, women, s, rights, in, domestic, abuse, cases, musawah, cedaw, kafa, and, other, organizations, have, proposed, ways, to, modify, sharia, inspired, laws, to, improve, women, s, rights, in, muslim, majority, nations, including, women, s, rights, in, domestic, abuse, cases, others, believe, that, wife, beating, is, not, consistent, with, a, more, modernist, perspective, of, the, quran, many, imams, and, scholars, who, learned, shariah, in, traditional, islamic, seminaries, object, to, the, misuse, of, this, verse, to, justify, domestic, violence, muslims, for, white, ribbon, campaign, was, launched, in, 2010, with, imams, and, muslim, leaders, committing, to, join, with, others, to, work, to, end,

abuse, rape, is, considered, a, serious, crime, in, the, sharia, law, since, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, ordered, rapists, to, be, punished, by, stoning, the, terms, ghasaba, and, ightasaba, have, been, used, by, traditional, jurists, when, discussing, sexual, assault, and, its, punishment, imam, al, sh, fi, defined, rape, as, forcing, a, woman, to, commit, zin, against, her, will, to, the, anafis, illegal, intercourse, is, considered, rape, when, there, is, no, consent, and, no, deliberate, action, from, the, victim, in, m, lik, s, view, rape, refers, to, any, kind, of, unlawful, sexual, intercourse, by, usurpation, and, without, consent, this, includes, instances, when, the, condition, of, the, victims, prevents, them, from, expressing, their, resistance, such, as, insanity,

or, suffering, the, cold, of, winter, are, also, regarded, as, against, one, s, will, sharia, authorized, the, institution, of, slavery, using, the, words, abd, slave, and, the, phrase, ma, malakat, aymanukum, that, which, your, right, hand, owns, to, refer, to, women, slaves, seized, as, captives, of, war, under, islamic, law, muslim, men, could, have, sexual, relations, with, female, captives, and, slaves, sharia, in, islam, s, history, provided, a, religious, foundation, for, enslaving, non, muslim, women, and, men, but, allowed, for, the, manumission, of, slaves, a, slave, woman, who, bore, a, child, to, her, muslim, master, umm, al, walad, could, not, be, sold, becoming, legally, free, upon, her, master, s, death, and, the, child, was, considered, free, and, a, legitimate, heir, of, the, father, some, extremists, have, used, their, interpretation, of, islamic, scriptures, and, sharia, in, particular, the, doctrine, of, jihad, to, justify, acts, of, war, and, terror, against, muslim, as, well, as, non, muslim, individuals, and, governments, the, expert, on, terrorism, rachel, ehrenfeld, wrote, that, the, sharia, s, finance, islamic, banking, is, a, new, weapon, in, the, arsenal, of, what, might, be, termed, fifth, generation, warfare, 5gw, however, sharia, complaint, financing, actually, requires, a, person, to, stay, away, from, weapons, manufacturing, in, classical, fiqh, the, term, jihad, refers, to, armed, struggle, against, oppressors, classical, jurists, developed, an, elaborate, set, of, rules, pertaining, to, jihad, including, prohibitions, on, harming, those, who, are, not, engaged, in, combat, according, to, bernard, lewis, t, no, time, did, the, classical, jurists, offer, any, approval, or, legitimacy, to, what, we, nowadays, call, terrorism, and, the, terrorist, practice, of, suicide, bombing, has, no, justification, in, terms, of, islamic, theology, law, or, tradition, in, the, modern, era, the, notion, of, jihad, has, lost, its, jurisprudential, relevance, and, instead, gave, rise, to, an, ideological, and, political, discourse, while, modernist, islamic, scholars, have, emphasized, defensive, and, non, military, aspects, of, jihad, some, radicals, have, advanced, aggressive, interpretations, that, go, beyond, the, classical, theory, for, al, qaeda, ideologues, in, jihad, all, means, are, legitimate, including, targeting, muslim, non, combatants, and, the, mass, killing, of, non, muslim, civilians, some, modern, ulema, such, as, yusuf, al, qaradawi, and, sulaiman, al, alwan, have, supported, attacks, against, israeli, army, reservists, and, hence, should, be, considered, as, soldiers, while, hamid, bin, abdallah, al, ali, declared, that, suicide, attacks, in, chechnya, were, justified, as, a, sacrifice, many, prominent, islamic, scholars, including, al, qaradawi, himself, have, issued, condemnations, of, terrorism, in, general, terms, for, example, abdul, aziz, ibn, abdullah, al, ash, sheikh, the, grand, mufti, of, saudi, arabia, has, stated, that, terrorizing, innocent, people, constitute, a, form, of, injustice, that, cannot, be, tolerated, by, islam, while, muhammad, sayyid, tantawy, grand, imam, of, al, azhar, and, former, grand, mufti, of, egypt, has, stated, that, attacking, innocent, people, is, not, courageous, it, is, stupid, and, will, be, punished, on, the, day, of, judgment, islamic, legal, tradition, has, a, number, of, parallels, with, judaism, in, both, religions, revealed, law, holds, a, central, place, in, contrast, to, christianity, which, does, not, possess, a, body, of, revealed, law, and, where, theology, rather, than, law, is, considered, to, be, the, principal, field, of, religious, study, both, islamic, and, jewish, law, halakha, are, derived, from, formal, textual, revelations, quran, and, pentateuch, as, well, as, less, formal, orally, transmitted, prophetic, traditions, hadith, and, mishna, according, to, some, scholars, the, words, sharia, and, halakha, both, mean, literally, the, path, to, follow, the, fiqh, literature, parallels, rabbinical, law, developed, in, the, talmud, with, fatwas, being, analogous, to, rabbinic, responsa, however, the, emphasis, on, qiyas, in, classical, sunni, legal, theory, is, both, more, explicitly, permissive, than, talmudic, law, with, respect, to, authorizing, individual, reason, as, a, source, of, law, and, more, implicitly, restrictive, in, excluding, other, unauthorized, forms, of, reasoning, early, islamic, law, developed, a, number, of, legal, concepts, that, anticipated, similar, such, concepts, that, later, appeared, in, english, common, law, similarities, exist, between, the, royal, english, contract, protected, by, the, action, of, debt, and, the, islamic, aqd, between, the, english, assize, of, novel, disseisin, and, the, islamic, istihqaq, and, between, the, english, jury, and, the, islamic, lafif, in, classical, maliki, jurisprudence, the, law, schools, known, as, inns, of, court, also, parallel, madrasahs, the, methodology, of, legal, precedent, and, reasoning, by, analogy, qiyas, are, also, similar, in, both, the, islamic, and, common, law, systems, as, are, the, english, trust, and, agency, institutions, to, the, islamic, waqf, and, hawala, institutions, respectively, elements, of, islamic, law, also, have, other, parallels, in, western, legal, systems, for, example, the, influence, of, islam, on, the, development, of, an, international, law, of, the, sea, can, be, discerned, alongside, that, of, the, roman, influence, george, makdisi, has, argued, that, the, madrasa, system, of, attestation, paralleled, the, legal, scholastic, system, in, the, west, which, gave, rise, to, the, modern, university, system, the, triple, status, of, faqih, master, of, law, mufti, professor, of, legal, opinions, and, mudarris, teacher, conferred, by, the, classical, islamic, legal, degree, had, its, equivalents, in, the, medieval, latin, terms, magister, professor, and, doctor, respectively, although, they, all, came, to, be, used, synonymously, in, both, east, and, west, makdisi, suggested, that, the, medieval, european, doctorate, licentia, docendi, was, modeled, on, the, islamic, degree, ijazat, al, tadris, wa, l, ifta, of, which, it, is, a, word, for, word, translation, with, the, term, ifta, issuing, of, fatwas, omitted, he, also, argued, that, these, systems, shared, fundamental, freedoms, the, freedom, of, a, professor, to, profess, his, personal, opinion, and, the, freedom, of, a, student, to, pass, judgement, on, what, he, is, learning, there, are, differences, between, islamic, and, western, legal, systems, for, example, sharia, classically, recognizes, only, natural, persons, and, never, developed, the, concept, of, a, legal, person, or, corporation, i, e, a, legal, entity, that, limits, the, liabilities, of, its, managers, shareholders, and, employees, exists, beyond, the, lifetimes, of, its, founders, and, that, can, own, assets, sign, contracts, and, appear, in, court, through, representatives, interest, prohibitions, imposed, secondary, costs, by, discouraging, record, keeping, and, delaying, the, introduction, of, modern, accounting, such, factors, according, to, timur, kuran, have, played, a, significant, role, in, retarding, economic, development, in, the, middle, east, however, the, rise, of, monopoly, wealth, and, corporations, have, proven, to, also, be, detrimental, to, the, economic, equality, of, a, society, ziauddin, sardar, also, suggests, that, the, promotion, of, equitable, wealth, distribution, and, suppression, of, monopoly, capital, are, a, part, of, islam, s, message, that, emphasises, genuine, equity, and, justice
