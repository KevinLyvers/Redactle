a, concept, is, an, abstract, idea, that, serves, as, a, foundation, for, more, concrete, principles, thoughts, and, beliefs, concepts, play, an, important, role, in, all, aspects, of, cognition, as, such, concepts, are, studied, within, such, disciplines, as, linguistics, psychology, and, philosophy, and, these, disciplines, are, interested, in, the, logical, and, psychological, structure, of, concepts, and, how, they, are, put, together, to, form, thoughts, and, sentences, the, study, of, concepts, has, served, as, an, important, flagship, of, an, emerging, interdisciplinary, approach, cognitive, science, in, contemporary, philosophy, three, understandings, of, a, concept, prevail, concepts, are, classified, into, a, hierarchy, higher, levels, of, which, are, termed, superordinate, and, lower, levels, termed, subordinate, additionally, there, is, the, basic, or, middle, level, at, which, people, will, most, readily, categorize, a, concept, for, example, a, basic, level, concept, would, be, chair, with, its, superordinate, furniture, and, its, subordinate, easy, chair, concepts, may, be, exact, or, inexact, when, the, mind, makes, a, generalization, such, as, the, concept, of, tree, it, extracts, similarities, from, numerous, examples, the, simplification, enables, higher, level, thinking, a, concept, is, instantiated, reified, by, all, of, its, actual, or, potential, instances, whether, these, are, things, in, the, real, world, or, other, ideas, concepts, are, studied, as, components, of, human, cognition, in, the, cognitive, science, disciplines, of, linguistics, psychology, and, philosophy, where, an, ongoing, debate, asks, whether, all, cognition, must, occur, through, concepts, concepts, are, regularly, formalized, in, mathematics, computer, science, databases, and, artificial, intelligence, examples, of, specific, high, level, conceptual, classes, in, these, fields, include, classes, schema, or, categories, in, informal, use, the, word, concept, often, just, means, any, idea, a, central, question, in, the, study, of, concepts, is, the, question, of, what, they, are, philosophers, construe, this, question, as, one, about, the, ontology, of, concepts, what, kind, of, things, they, are, the, ontology, of, concepts, determines, the, answer, to, other, questions, such, as, how, to, integrate, concepts, into, a, wider, theory, of, the, mind, what, functions, are, allowed, or, disallowed, by, a, concept, s, ontology, etc, there, are, two, main, views, of, the, ontology, of, concepts, 1, concepts, are, abstract, objects, and, 2, concepts, are, mental, representations, within, the, framework, of, the, representational, theory, of, mind, the, structural, position, of, concepts, can, be, understood, as, follows, concepts, serve, as, the, building, blocks, of, what, are, called, mental, representations, colloquially, understood, as, ideas, in, the, mind, mental, representations, in, turn, are, the, building, blocks, of, what, are, called, propositional, attitudes, colloquially, understood, as, the, stances, or, perspectives, we, take, towards, ideas, be, it, believing, doubting, wondering, accepting, etc, and, these, propositional, attitudes, in, turn, are, the, building, blocks, of, our, understanding, of, thoughts, that, populate, everyday, life, as, well, as, folk, psychology, in, this, way, we, have, an, analysis, that, ties, our, common, everyday, understanding, of, thoughts, down, to, the, scientific, and, philosophical, understanding, of, concepts, in, a, physicalist, theory, of, mind, a, concept, is, a, mental, representation, which, the, brain, uses, to, denote, a, class, of, things, in, the, world, this, is, to, say, that, it, is, literally, a, symbol, or, group, of, symbols, together, made, from, the, physical, material, of, the, brain, concepts, are, mental, representations, that, allow, us, to, draw, appropriate, inferences, about, the, type, of, entities, we, encounter, in, our, everyday, lives, concepts, do, not, encompass, all, mental, representations, but, are, merely, a, subset, of, them, the, use, of, concepts, is, necessary, to, cognitive, processes, such, as, categorization, memory, decision, making, learning, and, inference, concepts, are, thought, to, be, stored, in, long, term, cortical, memory, in, contrast, to, episodic, memory, of, the, particular, objects, and, events, which, they, abstract, which, are, stored, in, hippocampus, evidence, for, this, separation, comes, from, hippocampal, damaged, patients, such, as, patient, hm, the, abstraction, from, the, day, s, hippocampal, events, and, objects, into, cortical, concepts, is, often, considered, to, be, the, computation, underlying, some, stages, of, sleep, and, dreaming, many, people, beginning, with, aristotle, report, memories, of, dreams, which, appear, to, mix, the, day, s, events, with, analogous, or, related, historical, concepts, and, memories, and, suggest, that, they, were, being, sorted, or, organized, into, more, abstract, concepts, sort, is, itself, another, word, for, concept, and, sorting, thus, means, to, organize, into, concepts, the, semantic, view, of, concepts, suggests, that, concepts, are, abstract, objects, in, this, view, concepts, are, abstract, objects, of, a, category, out, of, a, human, s, mind, rather, than, some, mental, representations, there, is, debate, as, to, the, relationship, between, concepts, and, natural, language, however, it, is, necessary, at, least, to, begin, by, understanding, that, the, concept, dog, is, philosophically, distinct, from, the, things, in, the, world, grouped, by, this, concept, or, the, reference, class, or, extension, concepts, that, can, be, equated, to, a, single, word, are, called, lexical, concepts, the, study, of, concepts, and, conceptual, structure, falls, into, the, disciplines, of, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and, cognitive, science, in, the, simplest, terms, a, concept, is, a, name, or, label, that, regards, or, treats, an, abstraction, as, if, it, had, concrete, or, material, existence, such, as, a, person, a, place, or, a, thing, it, may, represent, a, natural, object, that, exists, in, the, real, world, like, a, tree, an, animal, a, stone, etc, it, may, also, name, an, artificial, man, made, object, like, a, chair, computer, house, etc, abstract, ideas, and, knowledge, domains, such, as, freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc, are, also, symbolized, by, concepts, a, concept, is, merely, a, symbol, a, representation, of, the, abstraction, the, word, is, not, to, be, mistaken, for, the, thing, for, example, the, word, moon, a, concept, is, not, the, large, bright, shape, changing, object, up, in, the, sky, but, only, represents, that, celestial, object, concepts, are, created, named, to, describe, explain, and, capture, reality, as, it, is, known, and, understood, kant, maintained, the, view, that, human, minds, possess, pure, or, a, priori, concepts, instead, of, being, abstracted, from, individual, perceptions, like, empirical, concepts, they, originate, in, the, mind, itself, he, called, these, concepts, categories, in, the, sense, of, the, word, that, means, predicate, attribute, characteristic, or, quality, but, these, pure, categories, are, predicates, of, things, in, general, not, of, a, particular, thing, according, to, kant, there, are, twelve, categories, that, constitute, the, understanding, of, phenomenal, objects, each, category, is, that, one, predicate, which, is, common, to, multiple, empirical, concepts, in, order, to, explain, how, an, a, priori, concept, can, relate, to, individual, phenomena, in, a, manner, analogous, to, an, a, posteriori, concept, kant, employed, the, technical, concept, of, the, schema, he, held, that, the, account, of, the, concept, as, an, abstraction, of, experience, is, only, partly, correct, he, called, those, concepts, that, result, from, abstraction, a, posteriori, concepts, meaning, concepts, that, arise, out, of, experience, an, empirical, or, an, a, posteriori, concept, is, a, general, representation, vorstellung, or, non, specific, thought, of, that, which, is, common, to, several, specific, perceived, objects, logic, i, 1, 1, note, 1, a, concept, is, a, common, feature, or, characteristic, kant, investigated, the, way, that, empirical, a, posteriori, concepts, are, created, the, logical, acts, of, the, understanding, by, which, concepts, are, generated, as, to, their, form, are, in, order, to, make, our, mental, images, into, concepts, one, must, thus, be, able, to, compare, reflect, and, abstract, for, these, three, logical, operations, of, the, understanding, are, essential, and, general, conditions, of, generating, any, concept, whatever, for, example, i, see, a, fir, a, willow, and, a, linden, in, firstly, comparing, these, objects, i, notice, that, they, are, different, from, one, another, in, respect, of, trunk, branches, leaves, and, the, like, further, however, i, reflect, only, on, what, they, have, in, common, the, trunk, the, branches, the, leaves, themselves, and, abstract, from, their, size, shape, and, so, forth, thus, i, gain, a, concept, of, a, tree, in, cognitive, linguistics, abstract, concepts, are, transformations, of, concrete, concepts, derived, from, embodied, experience, the, mechanism, of, transformation, is, structural, mapping, in, which, properties, of, two, or, more, source, domains, are, selectively, mapped, onto, a, blended, space, fauconnier, turner, 1995, see, conceptual, blending, a, common, class, of, blends, are, metaphors, this, theory, contrasts, with, the, rationalist, view, that, concepts, are, perceptions, or, recollections, in, plato, s, term, of, an, independently, existing, world, of, ideas, in, that, it, denies, the, existence, of, any, such, realm, it, also, contrasts, with, the, empiricist, view, that, concepts, are, abstract, generalizations, of, individual, experiences, because, the, contingent, and, bodily, experience, is, preserved, in, a, concept, and, not, abstracted, away, while, the, perspective, is, compatible, with, jamesian, pragmatism, the, notion, of, the, transformation, of, embodied, concepts, through, structural, mapping, makes, a, distinct, contribution, to, the, problem, of, concept, formation, platonist, views, of, the, mind, construe, concepts, as, abstract, objects, plato, was, the, starkest, proponent, of, the, realist, thesis, of, universal, concepts, by, his, view, concepts, and, ideas, in, general, are, innate, ideas, that, were, instantiations, of, a, transcendental, world, of, pure, forms, that, lay, behind, the, veil, of, the, physical, world, in, this, way, universals, were, explained, as, transcendent, objects, needless, to, say, this, form, of, realism, was, tied, deeply, with, plato, s, ontological, projects, this, remark, on, plato, is, not, of, merely, historical, interest, for, example, the, view, that, numbers, are, platonic, objects, was, revived, by, kurt, g, del, as, a, result, of, certain, puzzles, that, he, took, to, arise, from, the, phenomenological, accounts, gottlob, frege, founder, of, the, analytic, tradition, in, philosophy, famously, argued, for, the, analysis, of, language, in, terms, of, sense, and, reference, for, him, the, sense, of, an, expression, in, language, describes, a, certain, state, of, affairs, in, the, world, namely, the, way, that, some, object, is, presented, since, many, commentators, view, the, notion, of, sense, as, identical, to, the, notion, of, concept, and, frege, regards, senses, as, the, linguistic, representations, of, states, of, affairs, in, the, world, it, seems, to, follow, that, we, may, understand, concepts, as, the, manner, in, which, we, grasp, the, world, accordingly, concepts, as, senses, have, an, ontological, status, according, to, carl, benjamin, boyer, in, the, introduction, to, his, the, history, of, the, calculus, and, its, conceptual, development, concepts, in, calculus, do, not, refer, to, perceptions, as, long, as, the, concepts, are, useful, and, mutually, compatible, they, are, accepted, on, their, own, for, example, the, concepts, of, the, derivative, and, the, integral, are, not, considered, to, refer, to, spatial, or, temporal, perceptions, of, the, external, world, of, experience, neither, are, they, related, in, any, way, to, mysterious, limits, in, which, quantities, are, on, the, verge, of, nascence, or, evanescence, that, is, coming, into, or, going, out, of, existence, the, abstract, concepts, are, now, considered, to, be, totally, autonomous, even, though, they, originated, from, the, process, of, abstracting, or, taking, away, qualities, from, perceptions, until, only, the, common, essential, attributes, remained, the, classical, theory, of, concepts, also, referred, to, as, the, empiricist, theory, of, concepts, is, the, oldest, theory, about, the, structure, of, concepts, it, can, be, traced, back, to, aristotle, and, was, prominently, held, until, the, 1970s, the, classical, theory, of, concepts, says, that, concepts, have, a, definitional, structure, adequate, definitions, of, the, kind, required, by, this, theory, usually, take, the, form, of, a, list, of, features, these, features, must, have, two, important, qualities, to, provide, a, comprehensive, definition, features, entailed, by, the, definition, of, a, concept, must, be, both, necessary, and, sufficient, for, membership, in, the, class, of, things, covered, by, a, particular, concept, a, feature, is, considered, necessary, if, every, member, of, the, denoted, class, has, that, feature, a, feature, is, considered, sufficient, if, something, has, all, the, parts, required, by, the, definition, for, example, the, classic, example, bachelor, is, said, to, be, defined, by, unmarried, and, man, an, entity, is, a, bachelor, by, this, definition, if, and, only, if, it, is, both, unmarried, and, a, man, to, check, whether, something, is, a, member, of, the, class, you, compare, its, qualities, to, the, features, in, the, definition, another, key, part, of, this, theory, is, that, it, obeys, the, law, of, the, excluded, middle, which, means, that, there, are, no, partial, members, of, a, class, you, are, either, in, or, out, the, classical, theory, persisted, for, so, long, unquestioned, because, it, seemed, intuitively, correct, and, has, great, explanatory, power, it, can, explain, how, concepts, would, be, acquired, how, we, use, them, to, categorize, and, how, we, use, the, structure, of, a, concept, to, determine, its, referent, class, in, fact, for, many, years, it, was, one, of, the, major, activities, in, philosophy, concept, analysis, concept, analysis, is, the, act, of, trying, to, articulate, the, necessary, and, sufficient, conditions, for, the, membership, in, the, referent, class, of, a, concept, for, example, shoemaker, s, classic, time, without, change, explored, whether, the, concept, of, the, flow, of, time, can, include, flows, where, no, changes, take, place, though, change, is, usually, taken, as, a, definition, of, time, given, that, most, later, theories, of, concepts, were, born, out, of, the, rejection, of, some, or, all, of, the, classical, theory, it, seems, appropriate, to, give, an, account, of, what, might, be, wrong, with, this, theory, in, the, 20th, century, philosophers, such, as, wittgenstein, and, rosch, argued, against, the, classical, theory, there, are, six, primary, arguments, summarized, as, follows, prototype, theory, came, out, of, problems, with, the, classical, view, of, conceptual, structure, prototype, theory, says, that, concepts, specify, properties, that, members, of, a, class, tend, to, possess, rather, than, must, possess, wittgenstein, rosch, mervis, brent, berlin, anglin, and, posner, are, a, few, of, the, key, proponents, and, creators, of, this, theory, wittgenstein, describes, the, relationship, between, members, of, a, class, as, family, resemblances, there, are, not, necessarily, any, necessary, conditions, for, membership, a, dog, can, still, be, a, dog, with, only, three, legs, this, view, is, particularly, supported, by, psychological, experimental, evidence, for, prototypicality, effects, participants, willingly, and, consistently, rate, objects, in, categories, like, vegetable, or, furniture, as, more, or, less, typical, of, that, class, it, seems, that, our, categories, are, fuzzy, psychologically, and, so, this, structure, has, explanatory, power, we, can, judge, an, item, s, membership, of, the, referent, class, of, a, concept, by, comparing, it, to, the, typical, member, the, most, central, member, of, the, concept, if, it, is, similar, enough, in, the, relevant, ways, it, will, be, cognitively, admitted, as, a, member, of, the, relevant, class, of, entities, rosch, suggests, that, every, category, is, represented, by, a, central, exemplar, which, embodies, all, or, the, maximum, possible, number, of, features, of, a, given, category, lech, gunturkun, and, suchan, explain, that, categorization, involves, many, areas, of, the, brain, some, of, these, are, visual, association, areas, prefrontal, cortex, basal, ganglia, and, temporal, lobe, the, prototype, perspective, is, proposed, as, an, alternative, view, to, the, classical, approach, while, the, classical, theory, requires, an, all, or, nothing, membership, in, a, group, prototypes, allow, for, more, fuzzy, boundaries, and, are, characterized, by, attributes, lakoff, stresses, that, experience, and, cognition, are, critical, to, the, function, of, language, and, labov, s, experiment, found, that, the, function, that, an, artifact, contributed, to, what, people, categorized, it, as, for, example, a, container, holding, mashed, potatoes, versus, tea, swayed, people, toward, classifying, them, as, a, bowl, and, a, cup, respectively, this, experiment, also, illuminated, the, optimal, dimensions, of, what, the, prototype, for, cup, is, prototypes, also, deal, with, the, essence, of, things, and, to, what, extent, they, belong, to, a, category, there, have, been, a, number, of, experiments, dealing, with, questionnaires, asking, participants, to, rate, something, according, to, the, extent, to, which, it, belongs, to, a, category, this, question, is, contradictory, to, the, classical, theory, because, something, is, either, a, member, of, a, category, or, is, not, this, type, of, problem, is, paralleled, in, other, areas, of, linguistics, such, as, phonology, with, an, illogical, question, such, as, is, i, or, o, a, better, vowel, the, classical, approach, and, aristotelian, categories, may, be, a, better, descriptor, in, some, cases, theory, theory, is, a, reaction, to, the, previous, two, theories, and, develops, them, further, this, theory, postulates, that, categorization, by, concepts, is, something, like, scientific, theorizing, concepts, are, not, learned, in, isolation, but, rather, are, learned, as, a, part, of, our, experiences, with, the, world, around, us, in, this, sense, concepts, structure, relies, on, their, relationships, to, other, concepts, as, mandated, by, a, particular, mental, theory, about, the, state, of, the, world, how, this, is, supposed, to, work, is, a, little, less, clear, than, in, the, previous, two, theories, but, is, still, a, prominent, and, notable, theory, this, is, supposed, to, explain, some, of, the, issues, of, ignorance, and, error, that, come, up, in, prototype, and, classical, theories, as, concepts, that, are, structured, around, each, other, seem, to, account, for, errors, such, as, whale, as, a, fish, this, misconception, came, from, an, incorrect, theory, about, what, a, whale, is, like, combining, with, our, theory, of, what, a, fish, is, when, we, learn, that, a, whale, is, not, a, fish, we, are, recognizing, that, whales, don, t, in, fact, fit, the, theory, we, had, about, what, makes, something, a, fish, theory, theory, also, postulates, that, people, s, theories, about, the, world, are, what, inform, their, conceptual, knowledge, of, the, world, therefore, analysing, people, s, theories, can, offer, insights, into, their, concepts, in, this, sense, theory, means, an, individual, s, mental, explanation, rather, than, scientific, fact, this, theory, criticizes, classical, and, prototype, theory, as, relying, too, much, on, similarities, and, using, them, as, a, sufficient, constraint, it, suggests, that, theories, or, mental, understandings, contribute, more, to, what, has, membership, to, a, group, rather, than, weighted, similarities, and, a, cohesive, category, is, formed, more, by, what, makes, sense, to, the, perceiver, weights, assigned, to, features, have, shown, to, fluctuate, and, vary, depending, on, context, and, experimental, task, demonstrated, by, tversky, for, this, reason, similarities, between, members, may, be, collateral, rather, than, causal, according, to, the, theory, of, ideasthesia, or, sensing, concepts, activation, of, a, concept, may, be, the, main, mechanism, responsible, for, the, creation, of, phenomenal, experiences, therefore, understanding, how, the, brain, processes, concepts, may, be, central, to, solving, the, mystery, of, how, conscious, experiences, or, qualia, emerge, within, a, physical, system, e, g, the, sourness, of, the, sour, taste, of, lemon, this, question, is, also, known, as, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, research, on, ideasthesia, emerged, from, research, on, synesthesia, where, it, was, noted, that, a, synesthetic, experience, requires, first, an, activation, of, a, concept, of, the, inducer, later, research, expanded, these, results, into, everyday, perception, there, is, a, lot, of, discussion, on, the, most, effective, theory, in, concepts, another, theory, is, semantic, pointers, which, use, perceptual, and, motor, representations, and, these, representations, are, like, symbols, the, term, concept, is, traced, back, to, 1554, 60, latin, conceptum, something, conceived
