middle, ages, and, did, not, exist, in, the, ancient, world, the, supernatural, is, featured, in, folklore, and, religious, contexts, but, can, also, feature, as, an, explanation, in, more, secular, contexts, as, in, the, cases, of, superstitions, or, belief, in, the, paranormal, the, term, is, attributed, to, non, physical, entities, such, as, angels, demons, gods, and, spirits, it, also,

the, world, for, example, as, an, adjective, the, term, can, mean, belonging, to, a, realm, or, system, that, transcends, nature, as, that, of, divine, magical, or, ghostly, beings, attributed, to, or, thought, to, reveal, some, force, beyond, scientific, understanding, or, the, laws, of, nature, occult, paranormal, or, more, than, what, is, natural, or, ordinary, unnaturally, or, extraordinarily, great, abnormal, extraordinary, obsolete, uses, include, of, relating, to, or, dealing, with, metaphysics, as, a, noun, the, term, can, mean, a, supernatural, being, with, a, particularly, strong, history, of, employment, in, relation, to, entities, from, the, mythologies, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, the, ancient, world, had, no, word, that, resembled, supernatural, dialogues, from, neoplatonic, philosophy, in, the, third, century, ad, influenced, the, development, of, the, concept, of, the, supernatural, which, later, evolved, through, christian, theology, the, term, nature, had, existed, since, antiquity, with, latin, authors, like, augustine, using, the, word, and, its, cognates, at, least, 600, times, in, city, of, god, in, the, medieval, period, nature, had, ten, different, meanings, and, natural, had, eleven, different, meanings, peter, lombard, a, medieval, scholastic, of, the, 12th, century, explored, causes, beyond, nature, questioning, how, certain, phenomena, could, be, attributed, solely, to, god, in, his, writings, he, used, the, term, praeter, naturam, to, describe, these, occurrences, in, the, scholastic, period, thomas, aquinas, classified, miracles, into, three, categories, above, nature, beyond, nature, and, against, nature, in, doing, so, he, sharpened, the, distinction, between, nature, and, miracles, more, than, the, early, church, fathers, had, done, as, a, result, he, had, created, a, dichotomy, of, sorts, of, the, natural, and, supernatural, though, the, phrase, supra, naturam, was, used, since, the, 4th, century, ad, it, was, in, the, 1200s, that, thomas, aquinas, used, the, term, supernaturalis, despite, this, the, term, had, to, wait, until, the, end, of, the, medieval, period, before, it, became, more, popularly, used, the, discussions, on, nature, from, the, scholastic, period, were, diverse, and, unsettled, with, some, postulating, that, even, miracles, are, natural, and, that, natural, magic, was, a, natural, part, of, the, world, the, metaphysical, considerations, of, the, existence, of, the, supernatural, can, be, difficult, to, approach, as, an, exercise, in, philosophy, or, theology, because, any, dependencies, on, its, antithesis, the, natural, will, ultimately, have, to, be, inverted, or, rejected, one, complicating, factor, is, that, there, is, disagreement, about, the, definition, of, natural, and, the, limits, of, naturalism, concepts, in, the, supernatural, domain, are, closely, related, to, concepts, in, religious, spirituality, and, occultism, or, spiritualism, for, sometimes, we, use, the, word, nature, for, that, author, of, nature, whom, the, schoolmen, harshly, enough, call, natura, naturans, as, when, it, is, said, that, nature, hath, made, man, partly, corporeal, and, partly, immaterial, sometimes, we, mean, by, the, nature, of, a, thing, the, essence, or, that, which, the, schoolmen, scruple, not, to, call, the, quiddity, of, a, thing, namely, the, attribute, or, attributes, on, whose, score, it, is, what, it, is, whether, the, thing, be, corporeal, or, not, as, when, we, attempt, to, define, the, nature, of, an, angle, or, of, a, triangle, or, of, a, fluid, body, as, such, sometimes, we, take, nature, for, an, internal, principle, of, motion, as, when, we, say, that, a, stone, let, fall, in, the, air, is, by, nature, carried, towards, the, centre, of, the, earth, and, on, the, contrary, that, fire, or, flame, does, naturally, move, upwards, toward, firmament, sometimes, we, understand, by, nature, the, established, course, of, things, as, when, we, say, that, nature, makes, the, night, succeed, the, day, nature, hath, made, respiration, necessary, to, the, life, of, men, sometimes, we, take, nature, for, an, aggregate, of, powers, belonging, to, a, body, especially, a, living, one, as, when, physicians, say, that, nature, is, strong, or, weak, or, spent, or, that, in, such, or, such, diseases, nature, left, to, herself, will, do, the, cure, sometimes, we, take, nature, for, the, universe, or, system, of, the, corporeal, works, of, god, as, when, it, is, said, of, a, phoenix, or, a, chimera, that, there, is, no, such, thing, in, nature, i, e, in, the, world, and, sometimes, too, and, that, most, commonly, we, would, express, by, nature, a, semi, deity, or, other, strange, kind, of, being, such, as, this, discourse, examines, the, notion, of, and, besides, these, more, absolute, acceptions, if, i, may, so, call, them, of, the, word, nature, it, has, divers, others, more, relative, as, nature, is, wont, to, be, set, or, in, opposition, or, contradistinction, to, other, things, as, when, we, say, of, a, stone, when, it, falls, downwards, that, it, does, it, by, a, natural, motion, but, that, if, it, be, thrown, upwards, its, motion, that, way, is, violent, so, chemists, distinguish, vitriol, into, natural, and, fictitious, or, made, by, art, i, e, by, the, intervention, of, human, power, or, skill, so, it, is, said, that, water, kept, suspended, in, a, sucking, pump, is, not, in, its, natural, place, as, that, is, which, is, stagnant, in, the, well, we, say, also, that, wicked, men, are, still, in, the, state, of, nature, but, the, regenerate, in, a, state, of, grace, that, cures, wrought, by, medicines, are, natural, operations, but, the, miraculous, ones, wrought, by, christ, and, his, apostles, were, supernatural, nomological, possibility, is, possibility, under, the, actual, laws, of, nature, most, philosophers, since, david, hume, have, held, that, the, laws, of, nature, are, metaphysically, contingent, that, there, could, have, been, different, natural, laws, than, the, ones, that, actually, obtain, if, so, then, it, would, not, be, logically, or, metaphysically, impossible, for, example, for, you, to, travel, to, alpha, centauri, in, one, day, it, would, just, have, to, be, the, case, that, you, could, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, but, of, course, there, is, an, important, sense, in, which, this, is, not, nomologically, possible, given, that, the, laws, of, nature, are, what, they, are, in, the, philosophy, of, natural, science, impossibility, assertions, come, to, be, widely, accepted, as, overwhelmingly, probable, rather, than, considered, proved, to, the, point, of, being, unchallengeable, the, basis, for, this, strong, acceptance, is, a, combination, of, extensive, evidence, of, something, not, occurring, combined, with, an, underlying, scientific, theory, very, successful, in, making, predictions, whose, assumptions, lead, logically, to, the, conclusion, that, something, is, impossible, while, an, impossibility, assertion, in, natural, science, can, never, be, absolutely, proved, it, could, be, refuted, by, the, observation, of, a, single, counterexample, such, a, counterexample, would, require, that, the, assumptions, underlying, the, theory, that, implied, the, impossibility, be, re, examined, some, philosophers, such, as, sydney, shoemaker, have, argued, that, the, laws, of, nature, are, in, fact, necessary, not, contingent, if, so, then, nomological, possibility, is, equivalent, to, metaphysical, possibility, the, term, supernatural, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, paranormal, or, preternatural, the, latter, typically, limited, to, an, adjective, for, describing, abilities, which, appear, to, exceed, what, is, possible, within, the, boundaries, of, the, laws, of, physics, epistemologically, the, relationship, between, the, supernatural, and, the, natural, is, indistinct, in, terms, of, natural, phenomena, that, ex, hypothesi, violate, the, laws, of, nature, in, so, far, as, such, laws, are, realistically, accountable, parapsychologists, use, the, term, psi, to, refer, to, an, assumed, unitary, force, underlying, the, phenomena, they, study, psi, is, defined, in, the, journal, of, parapsychology, as, personal, factors, or, processes, in, nature, which, transcend, accepted, laws, 1948, 311, and, which, are, non, physical, in, nature, 1962, 310, and, it, is, used, to, cover, both, extrasensory, perception, esp, an, awareness, of, or, response, to, an, external, event, or, influence, not, apprehended, by, sensory, means, 1962, 309, or, inferred, from, sensory, knowledge, and, psychokinesis, pk, the, direct, influence, exerted, on, a, physical, system, by, a, subject, without, any, known, intermediate, energy, or, instrumentation, 1945, 305, views, on, the, supernatural, vary, for, example, it, may, be, seen, as, anthropological, studies, across, cultures, indicate, that, people, do, not, hold, or, use, natural, and, supernatural, explanations, in, a, mutually, exclusive, or, dichotomous, fashion, instead, the, reconciliation, of, natural, and, supernatural, explanations, is, normal, and, pervasive, across, cultures, cross, cultural, studies, indicate, that, there, is, coexistence, of, natural, and, supernatural, explanations, in, both, adults, and, children, for, explaining, numerous, things, about, the, world, such, as, illness, death, and, origins, context, and, cultural, input, play, a, large, role, in, determining, when, and, how, individuals, incorporate, natural, and, supernatural, explanations, the, coexistence, of, natural, and, supernatural, explanations, in, individuals, may, be, the, outcomes, two, distinct, cognitive, domains, one, concerned, with, the, physical, mechanical, relations, and, another, with, social, relations, studies, on, indigenous, groups, have, allowed, for, insights, on, how, such, coexistence, of, explanations, may, function, a, deity, d, i, t, i, or, d, e, t, i, is, a, supernatural, being, considered, divine, or, sacred, the, oxford, dictionary, of, english, defines, deity, as, a, god, or, goddess, in, a, polytheistic, religion, or, anything, revered, as, divine, c, scott, littleton, defines, a, deity, as, a, being, with, powers, greater, than, those, of, ordinary, humans, but, who, interacts, with, humans, positively, or, negatively, in, ways, that, carry, humans, to, new, levels, of, consciousness, beyond, the, grounded, preoccupations, of, ordinary, life, a, male, deity, is, a, god, while, a, female, deity, is, a, goddess, religions, can, be, categorized, by, how, many, deities, they, worship, monotheistic, religions, accept, only, one, deity, predominantly, referred, to, as, god, polytheistic, religions, accept, multiple, deities, henotheistic, religions, accept, one, supreme, deity, without, denying, other, deities, considering, them, as, equivalent, aspects, of, the, same, divine, principle, and, nontheistic, religions, deny, any, supreme, eternal, creator, deity, but, accept, a, pantheon, of, deities, which, live, die, and, are, reborn, just, like, any, other, being, 35, 37, 357, 358, various, cultures, have, conceptualized, a, deity, differently, than, a, monotheistic, god, a, deity, need, not, be, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, or, eternal, the, monotheistic, god, however, does, have, these, attributes, monotheistic, religions, typically, refer, to, god, in, masculine, terms, 96, while, other, religions, refer, to, their, deities, in, a, variety, of, ways, masculine, feminine, androgynous, and, gender, neutral, historically, many, ancient, cultures, such, as,

effects, respectively, some, avestan, and, vedic, deities, were, viewed, as, ethical, concepts, in, indian, religions, deities, have, been, envisioned, as, manifesting, within, the, temple, of, every,

ethical, life, where, they, become, guardian, deities, and, live, blissfully, in, heaven, but, are, also, subject, to, death, when, their, merit, runs, out, 35, 38, 356, 359, an, angel, is, generally,

god, could, do, that, is, to, bring, something, from, nothing, in, fairness, however, equal, stress, should, be, placed, on, process, theism, s, denial, of, the, natural, as, traditionally, conceived,

be, as, old, as, humanity, itself, common, features, of, underworld, myths, are, accounts, of, living, people, making, journeys, to, the, underworld, often, for, some, heroic, purpose, other, myths, reinforce, traditions, that, entrance, of, souls, to, the, underworld, requires, a, proper, observation, of, ceremony, such, as, the, ancient, greek, story, of, the, recently, dead, patroclus, haunting, achilles, until, his, body, could, be, properly, buried, for, this, purpose, persons, having, social, status, were, dressed, and, equipped, in, order, to, better, navigate, the, underworld, a, number, of, mythologies, incorporate, the, concept, of, the, soul, of, the, deceased, making, its, own, journey, to, the, underworld, with, the, dead, needing, to, be, taken, across, a, defining, obstacle, such, as, a, lake, or, a, river, to, reach, this, destination, imagery, of, such, journeys, can, be, found, in, both, ancient, and, modern, art, the, descent, to, the, underworld, has, been, described, as, the, single, most, important, myth, for, modernist, authors, a, spirit, is, a, supernatural, being, often, but, not, exclusively, a, non, physical, entity, such, as, a, ghost, fairy, jinn, or, angel, the, concepts, of, a, person, s, spirit, and, soul, often, also, overlap, as, both, are, either, contrasted, with, or, given, ontological, priority, over, the, body, and, both, are,

to, dismiss, them, as, physically, impossible, that, is, requiring, violation, of, established, laws, of, physics, within, their, domain, of, validity, or, impossible, to, confirm, by, their, nature, because, all, possible, physical, mechanisms, can, never, be, ruled, out, the, former, position, is, expressed, for, instance, by, thomas, jefferson, and, the, latter, by, david, hume, theologians, typically, say, that, with, divine, providence, god, regularly, works, through, nature, yet, as, a, creator, is, free, to, work, without, above, or, against, it, as, well, the, possibility, and,
