non, action, or, not, acting, is, a, central, concept, of, the, tao, te, ching, the, concept, of, wu, wei, is, multifaceted, and, reflected, in, the, words, multiple, meanings, even, in, english, translation, it, can, mean, not, doing, anything, not, forcing, not, acting, in, the, theatrical, sense, creating, nothingness, acting, spontaneously, and, flowing, with, the, moment, this, concept, is, used, to, explain, ziran, or, harmony, with, the, tao, it, includes, the, concepts, that, value, distinctions, are, ideological, and, seeing, ambition, of, all, sorts, as, originating, from, the,

according, to, holmes, welch, it, is, a, famous, puzzle, which, everyone, would, like, to, feel, he, had, solved, the, first, english, translation, of, the, tao, te, ching, was, produced, in, 1868, by, the, scottish, protestant, missionary, john, chalmers, entitled, the, speculations, on, metaphysics, polity, and, morality, of, the, old, philosopher, lau, tsze, it, was, heavily, indebted, to, julien, s, french, translation, and, dedicated, to, james, legge, who, later, produced, his, own, translation, for, oxford, s, sacred, books, of, the, east, other, notable, english, translations, of, the, tao, te, ching, are, those, produced, by, chinese, scholars, and, teachers, a, 1948, translation, by, linguist, lin, yutang, a, 1961, translation, by, author, john, ching, hsiung, wu, a, 1963,

jane, english, many, translations, are, written, by, people, with, a, foundation, in, chinese, language, and, philosophy, who, are, trying, to, render, the, original, meaning, of, the, text, as, faithfully, as, possible, into, english, some, of, the, more, popular, translations, are, written, from, a, less, scholarly, perspective, giving, an, individual, author, s, interpretation, critics, of, these, versions, claim, that, their, translators, deviate, from, the, text, and, are, incompatible, with, the, history, of, chinese, thought, russell, kirkland, goes, further, to, argue, that, these, versions, are, based, on, western, orientalist, fantasies, and, represent, the, colonial, appropriation, of, chinese, culture, other, taoism, scholars, such, as, michael, lafargue, and, jonathan, herman, argue, that, while, they, do, not, pretend, to, scholarship, they, meet, a, real, spiritual, need, in, the, west, these, westernized, versions, aim, to, make, the, wisdom, of, the, tao, te, ching, more, accessible, to, modern, english, speaking, readers, by, typically, employing, more, familiar, cultural, and, temporal, references, the, tao, te, ching, is, written, in, classical, chinese, which, generally, poses, a, number, of, challenges, for, interpreters, and, translators, as, holmes, welch, notes, the, written, language, has, no, active, or, passive, no, singular, or, plural, no, case, no, person, no, tense, no, mood, moreover, the, received, text, lacks, many, grammatical, particles, which, are, preserved, in, the, older, mawangdui, and, beida, texts, which, permit, the, text, to, be, more, precise, lastly, many, passages, of, the, tao, te, ching, are, deliberately, ambiguous, since, there, is, very, little, punctuation, in, classical, chinese, determining, the, precise, boundaries, between, words, and, sentences, is, not, always, trivial, deciding, where, these, phrasal, boundaries, are, must, be, done, by, the, interpreter, some, translators, have, argued, that, the, received, text, is, so, corrupted, due, to, its, original, medium, being, bamboo, strips, linked, with, silk, threads, that, it, is, impossible, to, understand, some, passages, without, some, transposition, of, characters
