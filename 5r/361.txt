claimed, to, be, the, oldest, known, name, for, the, ibis, normally, written, as, hbj, the, addition, of, ty, denotes, that, he, possessed, the, attributes, of, the, ibis, hence, thoth, s, name,

with, the, head, of, an, ibis, possibly, because, the, egyptians, saw, the, curve, of, the, ibis, beak, as, a, symbol, of, the, crescent, moon, sometimes, he, was, depicted, as, a, baboon, holding, up, a, crescent, moon, during, the, late, period, of, ancient, egypt, a, cult, of, thoth, gained, prominence, due, to, its, main, center, khmun, hermopolis, magna, also, becoming, the, capital, millions, of, dead, ibis, were, mummified, and, buried, in, his, honor, thoth, was, inserted, in, many, tales, as, the, wise, counselor, and, persuader, and, his, association, with, learning, and, measurement, led, him, to, be, connected, with, seshat, the, earlier, deification, of, wisdom, who, was, said, to, be, his, daughter, or, variably, his, wife, thoth, s, qualities, also, led, to, him, being, identified, by, the, greeks, with, their, closest, matching, god, hermes, with, whom, thoth, was, eventually, combined, as, hermes, trismegistus, leading, to, the, greeks, naming, thoth, s, cult, center, as, hermopolis, meaning, city, of, hermes, in, the, papyrus, of, ani, copy, of, the, egyptian, book, of, the, dead, the, scribe, proclaims, i, am, thy, writing, palette, o, thoth, and,
