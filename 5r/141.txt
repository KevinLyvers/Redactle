totem, early, anthropologists, sometimes, attributed, aboriginal, and, torres, strait, islander, totemism, to, ignorance, about, procreation, with, the, entrance, of, an, ancestral, spirit, individual, the, totem, into, the, woman, believed, to, be, the, cause, of, pregnancy, rather, than, insemination, james, george, frazer, in, totemism, and, exogamy, wrote, that, aboriginal, people, have, no, idea, of, procreation, as, being, directly, associated, with, sexual, intercourse, and, firmly, believe, that, children, can, be, born, without, this, taking, place, frazer, s, thesis, has, been, criticised, by, other, anthropologists, including, alfred, radcliffe, brown, in, nature, in, 1938, early, anthropologists, and, ethnologists, like, james, george, frazer, alfred, cort, haddon, john, ferguson, mclennan, and, w, h, r, rivers, identified, totemism, as, a, shared, practice, across, indigenous, groups, in, unconnected, parts, of, the, world, typically, reflecting, a, stage, of, human, development, scottish, ethnologist, john, ferguson, mclennan, following, the, vogue, of, 19th, century, research, addressed, totemism, in, a, broad, perspective, in, his, study, the, worship, of, animals, and, plants, 1869, 1870, mclennan, did, not, seek, to, explain, the, specific, origin, of, the, totemistic, phenomenon, but, sought, to, indicate, that, all, of, the, human, race, had, in, ancient, times, gone, through, a, totemistic, stage, another, scottish, scholar, andrew, lang, early, in, the, 20th, century, advocated, a, nominalistic, explanation, of, totemism, namely, that, local, groups, or, clans, in, selecting, a, totemistic, name, from, the, realm, of, nature, were, reacting, to, a, need, to, be, differentiated, if, the, origin, of, the, name, was, forgotten, lang, argued, there, followed, a, mystical, relationship, between, the, object, from, which, the, name, was, once, derived, and, the, groups, that, bore, these, names, through, nature, myths, animals, and, natural, objects, were, considered, as, the, relatives, patrons, or, ancestors, of, the, respective, social, units, british, anthropologist, sir, james, george, frazer, published, totemism, and, exogamy, in, 1910, a, four, volume, work, based, largely, on, his, research, among, indigenous, australians, and, melanesians, along, with, a, compilation, of, the, work, of, other, writers, in, the, field, by, 1910, the, idea, of, totemism, as, having, common, properties, across, cultures, was, being, challenged, with, russian, american, ethnologist, alexander, goldenweiser, subjecting, totemistic, phenomena, to, sharp, criticism, goldenweiser, compared, indigenous, australians, and, first, nations, in, british, columbia, to, show, that, the, supposedly, shared, qualities, of, totemism, exogamy, naming, descent, from, the, totem, taboo, ceremony, reincarnation, guardian, spirits, and, secret, societies, and, art, were, actually, expressed, very, differently, between, australia, and, british, columbia, and, between, different, peoples, in, australia, and, between, different, peoples, in, british, columbia, he, then, expands, his, analysis, to, other, groups, to, show, that, they, share, some, of, the, customs, associated, with, totemism, without, having, totems, he, concludes, by, offering, two, general, definitions, of, totemism, one, of, which, is, totemism, is, the, tendency, of, definite, social, units, to, become, associated, with, objects, and, symbols, of, emotional, value, the, founder, of, a, french, school, of, sociology, mile, durkheim, examined, totemism, from, a, sociological, and, theological, point, of, view, attempting, to, discover, a, pure, religion, in, very, ancient, forms, and, claimed, to, see, the, origin, of, religion, in, totemism, in, addition, he, argued, that, totemism, also, served, as, a, form, of, collective, worship, reinforcing, social, cohesion, and, solidarity, the, leading, representative, of, british, social, anthropology, a, r, radcliffe, brown, took, a, totally, different, view, of, totemism, like, franz, boas, he, was, skeptical, that, totemism, could, be, described, in, any, unified, way, in, this, he, opposed, the, other, pioneer, of, social, anthropology, in, england, bronis, aw, malinowski, who, wanted, to, confirm, the, unity, of, totemism, in, some, way, and, approached, the, matter, more, from, a, biological, and, psychological, point, of, view, than, from, an, ethnological, one, according, to, malinowski, totemism, was, not, a, cultural, phenomenon, but, rather, the, result, of, trying, to, satisfy, basic, human, needs, within, the, natural, world, as, far, as, radcliffe, brown, was, concerned, totemism, was, composed, of, elements, that, were, taken, from, different, areas, and, institutions, and, what, they, have, in, common, is, a, general, tendency, to, characterize, segments, of, the, community, through, a, connection, with, a, portion, of, nature, in, opposition, to, durkheim, s, theory, of, sacralization, radcliffe, brown, took, the, point, of, view, that, nature, is, introduced, into, the, social, order, rather, than, secondary, to, it, at, first, he, shared, with, malinowski, the, opinion, that, an, animal, becomes, totemistic, when, it, is, good, to, eat, he, later, came, to, oppose, the, usefulness, of, this, viewpoint, since, many, totems, such, as, crocodiles, and, flies, are, dangerous, and, unpleasant, in, 1938, the, structural, functionalist, anthropologist, a, p, elkin, wrote, the, australian, aborigines, how, to, understand, them, his, typologies, of, totemism, included, eight, forms, and, six, functions, the, forms, identified, were, the, functions, identified, were, the, terms, in, elkin, s, typologies, see, some, use, today, but, aboriginal, customs, are, seen, as, more, diverse, than, his, typologies, suggest, as, a, chief, representative, of, modern, structuralism, french, ethnologist, claude, l, vi, strauss, and, his, le, tot, misme, aujourd, hui, totemism, today, are, often, cited, in, the, field, in, the, 21st, century, australian, anthropologists, question, the, extent, to, which, totemism, can, be, generalized, even, across, different, aboriginal, australian, peoples, let, alone, to, other, cultures, like, the, ojibwe, from, whom, the, term, was, originally, derived, rose, james, and, watson, write, that, the, term, totem, has, proved, to, be, a, blunt, instrument, far, more, subtlety, is, required, and, again, there, is, regional, variation, on, this, issue, poets, and, to, a, lesser, extent, fiction, writers, often, use, anthropological, concepts, including, the, anthropological, understanding, of, totemism, for, this, reason, literary, criticism, often, resorts, to, psychoanalytic, anthropological, analyses
