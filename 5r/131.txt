subsequently, acts, upon, this, knowledge, divination, has, long, attracted, criticism, in, the, modern, era, it, has, been, dismissed, by, the, scientific, community, and, by, skeptics, as, being, superstitious, experiments, do, not, support, the, idea, that, divination, techniques, can, actually, predict, the, future, more, reliably, or, precisely, than, would, be, possible, without, it, in, antiquity, divination, came, under, attack, from, philosophers, such, as, the, academic, skeptic, cicero, in, de, divinatione, 1st, century, bce, and, the, pyrrhonist, sextus, empiricus, in, against, the, astrologers, 2nd, century, ce, the, satirist, lucian, c, 125, after, 180, devoted, an, essay, to, alexander, the, false, prophet, the, oracle, of, amun, at, the, siwa, oasis, was, made, famous, when, alexander, the, great, visited, it, after, conquering, egypt, from, persia, in, 332, bc, deuteronomy, 18, 10, 12, or, leviticus, 19, 26, can, be, interpreted, as, categorically, forbidding, divination, but, some, biblical, practices, such, as, urim, and, thummim, casting, lots, and, prayer, are, considered, to, be, divination, trevan, g, hatch, disputes, these, comparisons, because, divination, did, not, consult, the, one, true, god, and, manipulated, the, divine, for, the, diviner, s, self, interest, one, of, the, earliest, known, divination, artifacts, a, book, called, the, sortes, sanctorum, is, believed, to, be, of, christian, roots, and, utilizes, dice, to, provide, insight, into, the, future, uri, gabbay, states, that, divination, was, associated, with, sacrificial, rituals, in, the, ancient, near, east, including, mesopotamia, and, israel, extispicy, was, a, common, example, where, diviners, would, pray, to, their, god, s, before, vivisecting, a, sacrificial, animal, their, abominal, organs, would, reveal, a, divine, message, which, aligned, with, cardiocentric, views, of, the, mind, both, oracles, and, seers, in, ancient, greece, practiced, divination, oracles, were, the, conduits, for, the, gods, on, earth, their, prophecies, were, understood, to, be, the, will, of, the, gods, verbatim, because, of, the, high, demand, for, oracle, consultations, and, the, oracles, limited, work, schedule, they, were, not, the, main, source, of, divination, for, the, ancient, greeks, that, role, fell, to, the, seers, greek, seers, were, not, in, direct, contact, with, the, gods, instead, they, were, interpreters, of, signs, provided, by, the, gods, seers, used, many, methods, to, explicate, the, will, of, the, gods, including, extispicy, ornithomancy, etc, they, were, more, numerous, than, the, oracles, and, did, not, keep, a, limited, schedule, thus, they, were, highly, valued, by, all, greeks, not, just, those, with, the, capacity, to, travel, to, delphi, or, other, such, distant, sites, the, disadvantage, of, seers, was, that, only, direct, yes, or, no, questions, could, be, answered, oracles, could, answer, more, generalized, questions, and, seers, often, had, to, perform, several, sacrifices, in, order, to, get, the, most, consistent, answer, for, example, if, a, general, wanted, to, know, if, the, omens, were, proper, for, him, to, advance, on, the, enemy, he, would, ask, his, seer, both, that, question, and, if, it, were, better, for, him, to, remain, on, the, defensive, if, the, seer, gave, consistent, answers, the, advice, was, considered, valid, during, battle, generals, would, frequently, ask, seers, at, both, the, campground, a, process, called, the, hiera, and, at, the, battlefield, called, the, sphagia, the, hiera, entailed, the, seer, slaughtering, a, sheep, and, examining, its, liver, for, answers, regarding, a, more, generic, question, the, sphagia, involved, killing, a, young, female, goat, by, slitting, its, throat, and, noting, the, animal, s, last, movements, and, blood, flow, the, battlefield, sacrifice, only, occurred, when, two, armies, prepared, for, battle, against, each, other, neither, force, would, advance, until, the, seer, revealed, appropriate, omens, because, the, seers, had, such, power, over, influential, individuals, in, ancient, greece, many, were, skeptical, of, the, accuracy, and, honesty, of, the, seers, the, degree, to, which, seers, were, honest, depends, entirely, on, the, individual, seers, despite, the, doubt, surrounding, individual, seers, the, craft, as, a, whole, was, well, regarded, and, trusted, by, the, greeks, and, the, stoics, accounted, for, the, validity, of, divination, in, their, physics, the, divination, method, of, casting, lots, cleromancy, was, used, by, the, remaining, eleven, disciples, of, jesus, in, acts, 1, 23, 26, to, select, a, replacement, for, judas, iscariot, therefore, divination, was, arguably, an, accepted, practice, in, the, early, church, however, divination, became, viewed, as, a, pagan, practice, by, christian, emperors, during, ancient, rome, in, 692, the, quinisext, council, also, known, as, the, council, in, trullo, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, passed, canons, to, eliminate, pagan, and, divination, practices, fortune, telling, and, other, forms, of, divination, were,

themselves, away, from, light, in, a, room, until, midnight, to, then, complete, a, set, of, complex, events, to, interpret, symbols, encountered, throughout, the, journey, to, foresee, the, coming,

earth, it, is, important, to, emphasize, the, practical, nature, of, divinatory, sciences, because, people, from, all, socioeconomic, levels, and, pedigrees, sought, the, advice, of, astrologers, to, make, important, decisions, in, their, lives, astronomy, was, made, a, distinct, science, by, intellectuals, who, did, not, agree, with, the, former, although, distinction, may, not, have, been, made, in, daily, practice, where, astrology, was, technically, outlawed, and, only, tolerated, if, it, was, employed, in, public, astrologers, trained, as, scientists, and, astronomers, were, able, to, interpret, the, celestial, forces, that, ruled, the, sub, lunar, to, predict, a, variety, of, information, from, lunar, phases, and, drought, to, times, of, prayer, and, the, foundation, of, cities,

principle, that, meaning, derives, from, a, unique, occupied, position, is, identical, to, the, core, principle, of, astrology, like, astronomy, geomancy, used, deduction, and, computation, to, uncover, significant, prophecies, as, opposed, to, omens, ilm, al, fa, l, which, were, process, of, reading, visible, random, events, to, decipher, the, invisible, realities, from, which, they, originated, it, was, upheld, by, prophetic, tradition, and, relied, almost, exclusively, on, text, specifically, the, qur, an, which, carried, a, table, for, guidance, and, poetry, as, a, development,

largely, because, of, the, qur, an, s, emphasis, on, the, predictive, dreams, of, abraham, yusuf, and, muhammad, the, important, delineation, within, the, practice, lies, between, incoherent, dreams, and, sound, dreams, which, were, a, part, of, prophecy, or, heavenly, message, dream, interpretation, was, always, tied, to, islamic, religious, texts, providing, a, moral, compass, to, those, seeking, advice, the, practitioner, needed, to, be, skilled, enough, to, apply, the, individual, dream, to, general, precedent, while, appraising, the, singular, circumstances, the, power, of, text,

of, language, specifically, arabic, as, the, expression, of, the, essence, of, what, it, signifies, once, the, believer, understood, this, while, remaining, obedient, to, god, s, will, they, could, uncover, the, essence, and, divine, truth, of, the, objects, inscribed, with, arabic, like, amulets, and, talismans, through, the, study, of, the, letters, of, the, qur, an, with, alphanumeric, computations, in, islamic, practice, in, senegal, and, gambia, just, like, many, other, west, african, countries, diviners, and, religious, leaders, and, healers, were, interchangeable, because, islam, was, closely, related, with, esoteric, practices, like, divination, which, were, responsible, for, the, regional, spread, of, islam, as, scholars, learned, esoteric, sciences, they, joined, local, non, islamic, aristocratic, courts, who, quickly, aligned, divination, and, amulets, with, the, proof, of, the, power, of, islamic, religion, so, strong, was, the, idea, of, esoteric, knowledge, in, west, african, islam, diviners, and, magicians, uneducated, in, islamic, texts, and, arabic, bore, the, same, titles, as, those, who, did, from, the, beginning, of, islam, there, was, and, is, still, a, vigorous, debate, about, whether, or, not, such, practices, were, actually, permissible, under, islam, with, some, scholars, like, abu, hamid, al, ghazili, d, 1111, objecting, to, the, science, of, divination, because, he, believed, it, bore, too, much, similarity, to, pagan, practices, of, invoking, spiritual, entities, that, were, not, god, other, scholars, justified, esoteric, sciences, by, comparing, a, practitioner, to, a, physician, trying, to, heal, the, sick, with, the, help, of, the, same, natural, principles, divination, was, a, central, component, of,
