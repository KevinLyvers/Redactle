heracles, h, r, k, l, i, z, herr, kleez, greek, lit, glory, fame, of, hera, born, alcaeus, alkaios, or, alcides, alkeid, s, was, a, divine, hero, in, greek, mythology, the, son, of, zeus, and, alcmene, and, the, foster, son, of, amphitryon, he, was, a, descendant, and, half, brother, as, they, are, both, sired, by, the, god, zeus, of, perseus, he, was, the, greatest, of, the, greek, heroes, the, ancestor, of, royal, clans, who, claimed, to, be, heracleidae, and, a, champion, of, the, olympian, order, against, chthonic, monsters, in, rome, and, the, modern, west, he, is, known, as, hercules, with, whom, the, later, roman, emperors, in, particular, commodus, and, maximian, often, identified, themselves, details, of, his, cult, were, adapted, to, rome, as, well, many, popular, stories, were, told, of, his, life, the, most, famous, being, the, twelve, labours, of, heracles, alexandrian, poets, of, the, hellenistic, age, drew, his, mythology, into, a, high, poetic, and, tragic, atmosphere, his, figure, which, initially, drew, on, near, eastern, motifs, such, as, the, lion, fight, was, widely, known, heracles, was, the, greatest, of, hellenic, chthonic, heroes, but, unlike, other, greek, heroes, no, tomb, was, identified, as, his, heracles, was, both, hero, and, god, as, pindar, says, heros, theos, at, the, same, festival, sacrifice, was, made, to, him, first, as, a, hero, with, a, chthonic, libation, and, then, as, a, god, upon, an, altar, thus, he, embodies, the, closest, greek, approach, to, a, demi, god, the, core, of, the, story, of, heracles, has, been, identified, by, walter, burkert, as, originating, in, neolithic, hunter, culture, and, traditions, of, shamanistic, crossings, into, the, netherworld, it, is, possible, that, the, myths, surrounding, heracles, were, based, on, the, life, of, a, real, person, or, several, people, whose, accomplishments, became, exaggerated, with, time, heracles, role, as, a, culture, hero, whose, death, could, be, a, subject, of, mythic, telling, see, below, was, accepted, into, the, olympian, pantheon, during, classical, times, this, created, an, awkwardness, in, the, encounter, with, odysseus, in, the, episode, of, odyssey, xi, called, the, nekuia, where, odysseus, encounters, heracles, in, hades, and, next, i, caught, a, glimpse, of, powerful, heracles, his, ghost, i, mean, the, man, himself, delights, in, the, grand, feasts, of, the, deathless, gods, on, high, around, him, cries, of, the, dead, rang, out, like, cries, of, birds, scattering, left, and, right, in, horror, as, on, he, came, like, night, ancient, critics, were, aware, of, the, problem, of, the, aside, that, interrupts, the, vivid, and, complete, description, in, which, heracles, recognizes, odysseus, and, hails, him, and, some, modern, critics, deny, that, the, verse, s, beginning, in, fagles, translation, his, ghost, i, mean, was, part, of, the, original, composition, once, people, knew, of, heracles, admission, to, olympus, they, would, not, tolerate, his, presence, in, the, underworld, remarks, friedrich, solmsen, noting, that, the, interpolated, verses, represent, a, compromise, between, conflicting, representations, of, heracles, the, ancient, greeks, celebrated, the, festival, of, the, heracleia, which, commemorated, the, death, of, heracles, on, the, second, day, of, the, month, of, metageitnion, which, would, fall, in, late, july, or, early, august, what, is, believed, to, be, an, egyptian, temple, of, heracles, in, the, bahariya, oasis, dates, to, 21, bce, a, reassessment, of, ptolemy, s, descriptions, of, the, island, of, malta, attempted, to, link, the, site, at, ras, ir, ra, eb, with, a, temple, to, heracles, but, the, arguments, are, not, conclusive, several, ancient, cities, were, named, heraclea, in, his, honor, a, very, small, island, close, to, the, island, of, lemnos, was, called, neai, from, which, means, i, dive, swim, because, heracles, swam, there, according, to, the, greek, legends, the, herculaneum, in, italy, was, founded, by, him, several, poleis, provided, two, separate, sanctuaries, for, heracles, one, recognizing, him, as, a, god, the, other, only, as, a, hero, sacrifice, was, made, to, him, as, a, hero, and, as, a, god, within, the, same, festival, this, ambiguity, helped, create, the, heracles, cult, especially, when, historians, e, g, herodotus, and, artists, encouraged, worship, such, as, the, painters, during, the, time, of, the, peisistratos, who, often, presented, heracles, entering, olympus, in, their, works, some, sources, explained, that, the, cult, of, heracles, persisted, because, of, the, hero, s, ascent, to, heaven, and, his, suffering, which, became, the, basis, for, festivals, ritual, rites, and, the, organization, of, mysteries, there, is, the, observation, for, example, that, sufferings, pathea, gave, rise, to, the, rituals, of, grief, and, mourning, which, came, before, the, joy, in, the, mysteries, in, the, sequence, of, cult, rituals, also, like, the, case, of, apollo, the, cult, of, heracles, had, been, sustained, through, the, years, by, absorbing, local, cult, figures, such, as, those, who, share, the, same, nature, he, was, also, constantly, invoked, as, a, patron, for, men, especially, the, young, ones, for, example, he, was, considered, the, ideal, in, warfare, so, he, presided, over, gymnasiums, and, the, ephebes, or, those, men, undergoing, military, training, there, were, ancient, towns, and, cities, that, also, adopted, heracles, as, a, patron, deity, contributing, to, the, spread, of, his, cult, there, was, the, case, of, the, royal, house, of, macedonia, which, claimed, lineal, descent, from, the, hero, primarily, for, purposes, of, divine, protection, and, legitimator, of, actions, the, earliest, evidence, that, shows, the, worship, of, heracles, in, popular, cult, was, in, 6th, century, bce, 121, 122, and, 160, 165, via, an, ancient, inscription, from, phaleron, after, the, 4th, century, bce, heracles, became, identified, with, the, phoenician, god, melqart, oitaeans, worshiped, heracles, and, called, him, cornopion, because, he, helped, them, get, rid, of, locusts, which, they, called, cornopes, while, the, citizens, of, erythrae, at, mima, called, him, ipoctonus, because, he, destroyed, the, vine, eating, ips, a, kind, of, cynips, wasp, there, extraordinary, strength, courage, ingenuity, and, sexual, prowess, with, both, males, and, females, were, among, the, characteristics, commonly, attributed, to, him, heracles, used, his, wits, on, several, occasions, when, his, strength, did, not, suffice, such, as, when, laboring, for, the, king, augeas, of, elis, wrestling, the, giant, antaeus, or, tricking, atlas, into, taking, the, sky, back, onto, his, shoulders, together, with, hermes, he, was, the, patron, and, protector, of, gymnasia, and, palaestrae, his, iconographic, attributes, are, the, lion, skin, and, the, club, these, qualities, did, not, prevent, him, from, being, regarded, as, a, playful, figure, who, used, games, to, relax, from, his, labors, and, played, a, great, deal, with, children, by, conquering, dangerous, archaic, forces, he, is, said, to, have, made, the, world, safe, for, mankind, and, to, be, its, benefactor, heracles, was, an, extremely, passionate, and, emotional, individual, capable, of, doing, both, great, deeds, for, his, friends, such, as, wrestling, with, thanatos, on, behalf, of, prince, admetus, who, had, regaled, heracles, with, his, hospitality, or, restoring, his, friend, tyndareus, to, the, throne, of, sparta, after, he, was, overthrown, and, being, a, terrible, enemy, who, would, wreak, horrible, vengeance, on, those, who, crossed, him, as, augeas, neleus, and, laomedon, all, found, out, to, their, cost, there, was, also, a, coldness, to, his, character, which, was, demonstrated, by, sophocles, depiction, of, the, hero, in, the, trachiniae, heracles, threatened, his, marriage, with, his, desire, to, bring, two, women, under, the, same, roof, one, of, them, was, his, wife, deianeira, in, the, works, of, euripides, involving, heracles, his, actions, were, partly, driven, by, forces, outside, rational, human, control, by, highlighting, the, divine, causation, of, his, madness, euripides, problematized, heracles, character, and, status, within, the, civilized, context, this, aspect, is, also, highlighted, in, hercules, furens, where, seneca, linked, the, hero, s, madness, to, an, illusion, and, a, consequence, of, heracles, refusal, to, live, a, simple, life, as, offered, by, amphitryon, it, was, indicated, that, he, preferred, the, extravagant, violence, of, the, heroic, life, and, that, its, ghosts, eventually, manifested, in, his, madness, and, that, the, hallucinatory, visions, defined, heracles, character, a, major, factor, in, the, well, known, tragedies, surrounding, heracles, is, the, hatred, that, the, goddess, hera, wife, of, zeus, had, for, him, heracles, was, the, son, of, the, affair, zeus, had, with, the, mortal, woman, alcmene, when, zeus, desired, alcmene, he, decided, to, make, one, night, last, three, by, ordering, helios, the, god, of, the, sun, not, to, rise, for, three, days, so, he, would, have, more, time, with, alcmene, zeus, made, love, to, her, after, disguising, himself, as, her, husband, amphitryon, home, early, from, war, amphitryon, did, return, later, the, same, night, and, alcmene, became, pregnant, with, his, son, at, the, same, time, a, case, of, heteropaternal, superfecundation, where, a, woman, carries, twins, sired, by, different, fathers, thus, heracles, very, existence, proved, at, least, one, of, zeus, many, illicit, affairs, and, hera, often, conspired, against, zeus, mortal, offspring, as, revenge, for, her, husband, s, infidelities, his, twin, mortal, brother, son, of, amphitryon, was, iphicles, father, of, heracles, charioteer, iolaus, on, the, night, heracles, and, iphicles, were, to, be, born, hera, knowing, of, her, husband, zeus, adultery, persuaded, zeus, to, swear, an, oath, that, the, child, born, that, night, to, a, member, of, the, house, of, perseus, would, become, high, king, hera, did, this, knowing, that, while, heracles, was, to, be, born, a, descendant, of, perseus, so, too, was, eurystheus, once, the, oath, was, sworn, hera, hurried, to, alcmene, s, dwelling, and, slowed, the, birth, of, heracles, and, iphicles, by, forcing, ilithyia, goddess, of, childbirth, to, sit, cross, legged, with, her, clothing, tied, in, knots, thereby, causing, the, twins, to, be, trapped, in, the, womb, meanwhile, hera, caused, eurystheus, to, be, born, prematurely, making, him, high, king, in, place, of, heracles, she, would, have, permanently, delayed, heracles, birth, had, she, not, been, fooled, by, galanthis, alcmene, s, servant, who, lied, to, ilithyia, saying, that, alcmene, had, already, delivered, the, baby, upon, hearing, this, she, jumped, in, surprise, loosing, the, knots, and, inadvertently, allowing, alcmene, to, give, birth, to, heracles, and, iphicles, fear, of, hera, s, revenge, led, alcmene, to, expose, the, infant, heracles, but, he, was, taken, up, and, brought, to, hera, by, his, half, sister, athena, who, played, an, important, role, as, protectress, of, heroes, hera, did, not, recognize, heracles, and, nursed, him, out, of, pity, heracles, suckled, so, strongly, that, he, caused, hera, pain, and, she, pushed, him, away, her, milk, sprayed, across, the, heavens, and, there, formed, the, milky, way, but, with, divine, milk, heracles, had, acquired, supernatural, powers, athena, brought, the, infant, back, to, his, mother, and, he, was, subsequently, raised, by, his, parents, the, child, was, originally, given, the, name, alcides, by, his, parents, it, was, only, later, that, he, became, known, as, heracles, he, was, renamed, heracles, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, mollify, hera, with, heracles, meaning, hera, s, pride, or, glory, he, and, his, twin, were, just, eight, months, old, when, hera, sent, two, giant, snakes, into, the, children, s, chamber, iphicles, cried, from, fear, but, his, brother, grabbed, a, snake, in, each, hand, and, strangled, them, he, was, found, by, his, nurse, playing, with, them, on, his, cot, as, if, they, were, toys, astonished, amphitryon, sent, for, the, seer, tiresias, who, prophesied, an, unusual, future, for, the, boy, saying, he, would, vanquish, numerous, monsters, after, killing, his, music, tutor, linus, with, a, lyre, he, was, sent, to, tend, cattle, on, a, mountain, by, his, foster, father, amphitryon, here, according, to, an, allegorical, parable, the, choice, of, heracles, invented, by, the, sophist, prodicus, c, 400, bce, and, reported, in, xenophon, s, memorabilia, 2, 1, 21, 34, he, was, visited, by, two, allegorical, figures, vice, and, virtue, who, offered, him, a, choice, between, a, pleasant, and, easy, life, or, a, severe, but, glorious, life, he, chose, the, latter, this, was, part, of, a, pattern, of, ethicizing, heracles, over, the, 5th, century, bce, later, in, thebes, heracles, married, king, creon, s, daughter, megara, in, a, fit, of, madness, induced, by, hera, heracles, killed, his, children, and, megara, after, his, madness, had, been, cured, with, hellebore, by, antikyreus, the, founder, of, antikyra, he, realized, what, he, had, done, and, fled, to, the, oracle, of, delphi, unbeknownst, to, him, the, oracle, was, guided, by, hera, he, was, directed, to, serve, king, eurystheus, for, ten, years, and, perform, any, task, eurystheus, required, of, him, eurystheus, decided, to, give, heracles, ten, labours, but, after, completing, them, heracles, was, cheated, by, eurystheus, when, he, added, two, more, resulting, in, the, twelve, labors, of, heracles, if, he, succeeded, he, would, be, purified, of, his, sin, and, as, myth, says, he, would, become, a, god, and, be, granted, immortality, other, traditions, place, heracles, madness, at, a, later, time, and, relate, the, circumstances, differently, in, some, traditions, there, was, only, a, divine, reason, for, heracles, twelve, labours, zeus, in, his, desire, not, to, leave, heracles, the, victim, of, hera, s, jealousy, made, her, promise, that, if, heracles, executed, twelve, great, works, in, the, service, of, eurystheus, he, should, become, immortal, in, the, play, herakles, by, euripides, heracles, is, driven, to, madness, by, hera, and, kills, his, children, after, his, twelve, labours, despite, the, difficulty, heracles, accomplished, these, tasks, but, eurystheus, in, the, end, did, not, accept, the, success, the, hero, had, with, two, of, the, labours, the, cleansing, of, the, augean, stables, because, heracles, was, going, to, accept, pay, for, the, labour, and, the, killing, of, the, lernaean, hydra, as, heracles, nephew, iolaus, had, helped, him, burn, the, stumps, of, the, multiplying, heads, eurystheus, set, two, more, tasks, fetching, the, golden, apples, of, hesperides, and, capturing, cerberus, in, the, end, with, ease, the, hero, successfully, performed, each, added, task, bringing, the, total, number, of, labours, up, to, twelve, not, all, versions, and, writers, give, the, labours, in, the, same, order, the, bibliotheca, 2, 5, 1, 2, 5, 12, gives, the, following, order, after, completing, these, tasks, heracles, fell, in, love, with, princess, iole, of, oechalia, king, eurytus, of, oechalia, promised, his, daughter, iole, to, whoever, could, beat, his, sons, in, an, archery, contest, heracles, won, but, eurytus, abandoned, his, promise, heracles, advances, were, spurned, by, the, king, and, his, sons, except, for, one, iole, s, brother, iphitus, heracles, killed, the, king, and, his, sons, excluding, iphitus, and, abducted, iole, iphitus, became, heracles, best, friend, however, once, again, hera, drove, heracles, mad, and, he, threw, iphitus, over, the, city, wall, to, his, death, once, again, heracles, purified, himself, through, three, years, of, servitude, this, time, to, queen, omphale, of, lydia, omphale, was, a, queen, or, princess, of, lydia, as, penalty, for, a, murder, imposed, by, xenoclea, the, delphic, oracle, heracles, was, to, serve, as, her, slave, for, a, year, he, was,

and, married, him, some, sources, mention, a, son, born, to, them, who, is, variously, named, it, was, at, that, time, that, the, cercopes, mischievous, wood, spirits, stole, heracles, weapons, he, punished, them, by, tying, them, to, a, stick, with, their, faces, pointing, downward, while, walking, through, the, wilderness, heracles, was, set, upon, by, the, dryopes, in, apollonius, of, rhodes, argonautica, it, is, recalled, that, heracles, had, mercilessly, slain, their, king, theiodamas, over, one, of, the, latter, s, bulls, and, made, war, upon, the, dryopes, because, they, gave, no, heed, to, justice, in, their, lives, after, the, death, of, their, king, the, dryopes, gave, in, and, offered, him, prince, hylas, he, took, the, youth, on, as, his, weapons, bearer, years, later, heracles, and, hylas, joined, the, crew, of, the, argo, as, argonauts, they, only, participated, in, part, of, the, journey, in, mysia, hylas, was, kidnapped, by, the, nymphs, of, a, local, spring, heracles, searched, for, a, long, time, but, hylas, had, fallen, in, love, with, the, nymphs, and, never, showed, up, again, in, other, versions, he, simply, drowned, either, way, the, argo, set,

deeds, of, heracles, on, his, way, back, to, mycenae, from, iberia, having, obtained, the, cattle, of, geryon, as, his, tenth, labour, heracles, came, to, liguria, in, north, western, italy, where, he, engaged, in, battle, with, two, giants, albion, and, bergion, or, dercynus, sons, of, poseidon, the, opponents, were, strong, heracles, was, in, a, difficult, position, so, he, prayed, to, his, father, zeus, for, help, under, the, aegis, of, zeus, heracles, won, the, battle, it, was, this, kneeling, position, of, heracles, when, he, prayed, to, his, father, zeus, that, gave, the, name, engonasin, derived, from, meaning, on, his, knees, or, the, kneeler, to, the, constellation, known, as, heracles, constellation, the, story, among, others, is, described, by, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, before, homer, s, trojan, war, heracles, had, made, an, expedition, to, troy, and, sacked, it, previously, poseidon, had, sent, a, sea, monster, greek, k, t, s, latin, cetus, to, attack, troy, the, story, is, related, in, several, digressions, in, the, iliad, 7, 451, 53, 20, 145, 48, 21, 442, 57, and, is, found, in, pseudo, apollodorus, bibliotheke, 2, 5, 9, this, expedition, became, the, theme, of, the, eastern, pediment, of, the, temple, of, aphaea, laomedon, planned, on, sacrificing, his, daughter, hesione, to, poseidon, in, the, hope, of, appeasing, him, heracles, happened, to, arrive, along, with, telamon, and, oicles, and, agreed, to, kill, the, monster, if, laomedon, would, give, him, the, horses, received, from, zeus, as, compensation, for, zeus, kidnapping, ganymede, laomedon, agreed, heracles, killed, the, monster, but, laomedon, went, back, on, his, word, accordingly, in, a, later, expedition, heracles, and, his, followers, attacked, troy, and, sacked, it, then, they, slew, all, laomedon, s, sons, present, there, save, podarces, who, was, renamed, priam, who, saved, his, own, life, by, giving, heracles, a, golden, veil, hesione, had, made, telamon, took, hesione, as, a, war, prize, and, they, had, a, son, teucer, after, heracles, had, performed, his, labours, gods, told, him, that, before, he, passed, into, the, company, of, the, gods, he, should, create, a, colony, at, sardinia, and, make, his, sons, whom, he, had, with, the, daughters, of, thespius, the, leaders, of, the, settlement, when, his, sons, became, adults, he, sent, them, together, with, iolaus, to, the, island, this, is, described, in, sophocles, s, trachiniae, and, in, ovid, s, metamorphoses, book, ix, having, wrestled, and, defeated, achelous, god, of, the, acheloos, river, heracles, takes, deianira, as, his, wife, travelling, to, tiryns, a, centaur, nessus, offers, to, help, deianira, across, a, fast, flowing, river, while, heracles, swims, it, however, nessus, is, true, to, the, archetype, of, the, mischievous, centaur, and, tries, to, steal, deianira, away, while, heracles, is, still, in, the, water, angry, heracles, shoots, him, with, his, arrows, dipped, in, the, poisonous, blood, of, the, lernaean, hydra, thinking, of, revenge, nessus, gives, deianira, his, blood, soaked, tunic, before, he, dies, telling, her, it, will, excite, the, love, of, her, husband, several, years, later, rumor, tells, deianira, that, she, has, a, rival, for, the, love, of, heracles, deianira, remembering, nessus, words, gives, heracles, the, bloodstained, shirt, lichas, the, herald, delivers, the, shirt, to, heracles, however, it, is, still, covered, in, the, hydra, s, blood, from, heracles, arrows, and, this, poisons, him, tearing, his, skin, and, exposing, his, bones, before, he, dies, heracles, throws, lichas, into, the, sea, thinking, he, was, the, one, who, poisoned, him, according, to, several, versions, lichas, turns, to, stone, becoming, a, rock, standing, in, the, sea, named, for, him, heracles, then, uproots, several, trees, and, builds, a, funeral, pyre, on, mount, oeta, which, poeas, father, of, philoctetes, lights, as, his, body, burns, only, his, immortal, side, is, left, through, zeus, apotheosis, heracles, rises, to, olympus, as, he, dies, no, one, but, heracles, friend, philoctetes, poeas, in, some, versions, would, light, his, funeral, pyre, in, an, alternative, version, it, is, iolaus, who, lights, the, pyre, for, this, action, philoctetes, or, poeas, received, heracles, bow, and, arrows, which, were, later, needed, by, the, greeks, to, defeat, troy, in, the, trojan, war, philoctetes, confronted, paris, and, shot, a, poisoned, arrow, at, him, the, hydra, poison, subsequently, led, to, the, death, of, paris, the, trojan, war, however, continued, until, the, trojan, horse, was, used, to, defeat, troy, according, to, herodotus, heracles, lived, 900, years, before, herodotus, own, time, c, 1300, bce, after, his, death, in, the, pyre, heracles, ascended, to, olympus, as, a, god, and, having, finally, reconciled, with, hera, he, got, her, daughter, hebe, as, his, fourth, and, final, wife, they, had, two, sons, together, alexiares, and, anicetus, when, typhon, attacked, olympus, all, gods, transformed, into, animals, and, ran, terrified, to, egypt, heracles, became, a, fawn, in, the, dialogues, of, the, gods, a, satirical, work, by, lucian, of, samosata, heracles, and, another, recently, deified, mortal, asclepius, fight, over, which, gets, the, most, prestigious, seat, on, the, table, of, the, gods, each, arguing, that, they, are, the, one, who, deserve, it, zeus, intervenes, and, rules, in, favour, of, asclepius, reasoning, that, the, best, seat, should, go, to, the, one, who, became, a, god, first, heracles, also, appears, to, philoctetes, stranded, and, abandoned, by, the, other, greeks, on, lemnos, island, and, through, his, deus, ex, machina, intervention, philoctetes, is, convinced, to, join, the, other, greeks, at, troy, where, he, kills, paris, with, heracles, s, arrows, in, christian, circles, a, euhemerist, reading, of, the, widespread, heracles, cult, was, attributed, to, a, historical, figure, who, had, been, offered, cult, status, after, his, death, thus, eusebius, preparation, of, the, gospel, 10, 12, reported, that, clement, could, offer, historical, dates, for, heracles, as, a, king, in, argos, from, the, reign, of, heracles, in, argos, to, the, deification, of, heracles, himself, and, of, asclepius, there, are,

the, same, time, that, eurystheus, ruled, over, mycenae, and, since, at, about, this, time, linus, was, heracles, teacher, one, can, conclude, based, on, jerome, s, date, in, his, universal, history,

were, in, her, own, possession, but, that, she, would, not, give, them, up, unless, he, would, consent, to, stay, with, her, for, a, time, heracles, accepted, the, request, and, became, by, her, the, father, of, agathyrsus, gelonus, and, scythes, the, last, of, them, became, king, of, the, scythians, according, to, his, father, s, arrangement, because, he, was, the, only, one, among, the, three,
