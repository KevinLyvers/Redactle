israelites, and, is, an, important, figure, in, abrahamic, religions, such, as, judaism, samaritanism, christianity, and, islam, jacob, first, appears, in, the, book, of, genesis, originating, from, the, hebrew, tradition, in, the, torah, described, as, the, son, of, isaac, and, rebecca, and, the, grandson, of, abraham, sarah, and, bethuel, jacob, is, presented, as, the, second, born, among, isaac, s, children, his, fraternal, twin, brother, is, the, elder, named, esau, according, to, the, biblical, account, jacob, is, said, to, have, bought, esau, s, birthright, and, with, his, mother, s, help, deceived, his, aging, father, to, bless, him, instead, of, esau, later, in, the, narrative, following, a, severe, drought, in, his, homeland, of, canaan, jacob, and, his, descendants, with, the, help, of, his, son, joseph, who, had, become, a, confidant, of, the, pharaoh, moved, to, egypt, where, jacob, died, at, the, age, of, 147, he, is, supposed, to, have, been, buried, in, the, cave, of, machpelah, jacob, had, twelve, sons, through, four, women, his, wives, and, cousins, leah, and, rachel, and, his, concubines, bilhah, and, zilpah, his, sons, were, in, order, of, their, birth,

benjamin, causing, tension, within, the, family, culminating, in, joseph, s, older, brothers, selling, him, into, slavery, scholars, have, taken, a, mixed, view, as, to, jacob, s, historicity, with, archaeology, so, far, producing, no, evidence, for, his, existence, william, albright, initially, dated, the, narratives, of, jacob, to, the, 19th, century, bce, but, later, scholars, like, john, j, bimson, and, nahum, sarna, argued, against, using, archaeological, evidence, to, support, such, claims, due, to, limited, knowledge, of, that, period, recent, scholars, such, as, thomas, l, thompson, and, william, dever, suggest, that, these, narratives, are, late, literary, compositions, with, ideological, purposes, rather, than, historical, accounts, according, to, the, folk, etymology, found, in, genesis, 25, 26, the, name, ya, aq, v, is, derived, from, aqev, heel, as, jacob, was, born, grasping, the, heel, of, his, twin, brother, esau, the, historical, origin, of, the, name, is, uncertain, although, similar, names, have, been, recorded, yaqub, har, is, recorded, as, a, place, name, in, a, list, by, thutmose, iii, 15th, century, bc, and, later, as, the, nomen, of, a, hyksos, pharaoh, the, hieroglyphs, are, ambiguous, and, can, be, read, as, yaqub, har, yaqubaal, or, yaqub, el, the, same, name, is, recorded, earlier, still, in, c, 1800, bc, in, cuneiform, inscriptions, spelled, ya, ah, qu, ub, el, ya, qu, ub, el, the, suggestion, that, the, personal, name, may, be, shortened, from, this, compound, name, which, would, translate, to, may, el, protect, originates, with, bright, 1960, previously, scholars, had, tended, to, find, the, more, straightforward, meaning, of, yaqub, el, jacob, is, god, the, name, israel, given, to, jacob, following, the, episode, of, his, wrestling, with, the, angel, genesis, 32, 22, 32, is, etymologized, as, composition, of, el, god, and, the, root, arah, to, rule, contend, have, power, prevail, over, kjv, a, prince, hast, thou, power, with, god, alternatively, the, el, can, be, read, as, the, subject, for, a, translation, of, el, rules, contends, struggles, the, septuagint, renders, the, name, i, kobos, ancient, greek, whence, latin, jacobus, english, jacob, the, biblical, account, of, the, life, of, jacob, is, found, in, the, book, of, genesis, chapters, 25, 50, jacob, and, his, twin, brother, esau, were, born, to, isaac, and, rebecca, after, 20, years, of, marriage, when, isaac, was, 60, years, of, age, rebecca, was, uncomfortable, during, her, pregnancy, and, went, to, inquire, of, god, why, she, was, suffering, she, received, the, prophecy, that, twins, were, fighting, in, her, womb, and, would, continue, to, fight, all, their, lives, even, after, they, became, two, separate, nations, the, prophecy, also, said, that, the, one, people, shall, be, stronger, than, the, other, people, and, the, elder, shall, serve, the, younger, genesis, 25, 25, kjv, when, the, time, came, for, rebecca, to, give, birth, the, firstborn, esau, came, out, covered, with, red, hair, as, if, he, were, wearing, a, hairy, garment, and, his, heel, was, grasped, by, the, hand, of, jacob, the, secondborn, according, to, genesis, 25, isaac, and, rebecca, named, the, first, son, esau, hebrew, the, second, son, they, named, jacob, hebrew, ya, aqob, or, ya, aqov, meaning, heel, catcher, supplanter, leg, puller, he, who, follows, upon, the, heels, of, one, from, hebrew, aqab, or, aqav, seize, by, the, heel, circumvent, restrain, a, wordplay, upon, hebrew, iqqebah, or, iqqbah, heel, the, boys, displayed, very, different, natures, as, they, matured, and, esau, was, a, cunning, hunter, a, man, of, the, field, but, jacob, was, a, simple, man, dwelling, in, tents, moreover, the, attitudes, of, their, parents, toward, them, also, differed, and, isaac, loved, esau, because, he, did, eat, of, his, venison, but, rebecca, loved, jacob, genesis, 25, 29, 34, tells, the, account, of, esau, selling, his, birthright, to, jacob, this, passage, tells, that, esau, returning, famished, from, the, fields, begged, jacob, to, give, him, some, of, the, stew, that, jacob, had, just, made, esau, referred, to, the, dish, as, that, same, red, pottage, giving, rise, to, his, nickname, hebrew, edom, meaning, red, jacob, offered, to, give, esau, a, bowl, of, stew, in, exchange, for, his, birthright, to, which, esau, agreed, as, isaac, aged, he, became, blind, and, was, uncertain, when, he, would, die, so, he, decided, to, bestow, esau, s, birthright, upon, him, he, requested, that, esau, go, out, to, the, fields, with, his, weapons, quiver, and, bow, to, kill, some, venison, isaac, then, requested, that, esau, make, savory, meat, for, him, out, of, the, venison, according, to, the, way, he, enjoyed, it, the, most, so, that, he, could, eat, it, and, bless, esau, rebecca, overheard, this, conversation, it, is, suggested, that, she, realized, prophetically, that, isaac, s, blessings, would, go, to, jacob, since, she, was, told, before, the, twins, birth, that, the, older, son, would, serve, the, younger, rebecca, blessed, jacob, and, she, quickly, ordered, jacob, to, bring, her, two, kid, goats, from, their, flock, so, that, he, could, take, esau, s, place, in, serving, isaac, and, receiving, his, blessing, jacob, protested, that, his, father, would, recognize, their, deception, since, esau, was, hairy, and, he, himself, was, smooth, skinned, he, feared, his, father, would, curse, him, as, soon, as, he, felt, him, but, rebecca, offered, to, take, the, curse, herself, then, insisted, that, jacob, obey, her, jacob, did, as, his, mother, instructed, and, when, he, returned, with, the, kids, rebecca, made, the, savory, meat, that, isaac, loved, before, she, sent, jacob, to, his, father, she, dressed, him, in, esau, s, garments, and, laid, goatskins, on, his, arms, and, neck, to, simulate, hairy, skin, disguised, as, esau, jacob, entered, isaac, s, room, surprised, that, esau, was, back, so, soon, isaac, asked, how, it, could, be, that, the, hunt, went, so, quickly, jacob, responded, because, the, lord, your, god, brought, it, to, me, rashi, says, isaac, s, suspicions, were, aroused, even, more, because, esau, never, used, the, personal, name, of, god, isaac, demanded, that, jacob, come, close, so, he, could, feel, him, but, the, goatskins, felt, just, like, esau, s, hairy, skin, confused, isaac, exclaimed, the, voice, is, jacob, s, voice, but, the, hands, are, the, hands, of, esau, still, trying, to, get, at, the, truth, isaac, asked, him, directly, art, thou, my, very, son, esau, and, jacob, answered, simply, i, am, isaac, proceeded, to, eat, the, food, and, to, drink, the, wine, that, jacob, gave, him, and, then, told, him, to, come, close, and, kiss, him, as, jacob, kissed, his, father, isaac, smelled, the, clothes, which, belonged, to, esau, and, finally, accepted, that, the, person, in, front, of, him, was, esau, isaac, then, blessed, jacob, with, the, blessing, that, was, meant, for, esau, genesis, 27, 28, 29, states, isaac, s, blessing, therefore, god, give, thee, of, the, dew, of, heavens, and, the, fatness, of, the, earth, and, plenty, of, corn, and, wine, let, people, serve, thee, be, lord, over, thy, brethren, and, let, thy, mother, s, sons, bow, down, to, thee, cursed, be, every, one, that, curseth, thee, and, blessed, be, he, that, blesseth, thee, jacob, had, scarcely, left, the, room, when, esau, returned, from, the, hunt, to, prepare, his, game, and, receive, the, blessing, the, realization, that, he, had, been, deceived, shocked, isaac, yet, he, acknowledged, that, jacob, had, received, the, blessings, by, adding, indeed, he, will, be, blessed, 27, 33, esau, was, heartbroken, by, the, deception, and, begged, for, his, own, blessing, having, made, jacob, a, ruler, over, his, brothers, isaac, could, only, promise, by, your, sword, you, shall, live, but, your, brother, you, shall, serve, yet, it, shall, be, that, when, you, are, aggrieved, you, may, cast, off, his, yoke, from, upon, your, neck, 27, 39, 40, although, esau, sold, jacob, his, own, birthright, which, was, his, blessing, for, red, pottage, esau, still, hated, jacob, for, receiving, his, blessing, that, their, father, isaac, unknowingly, had, given, to, him, he, vowed, to, kill, jacob, as, soon, as, isaac, died, when, rebecca, heard, about, his, murderous, intentions, she, ordered, jacob, to, travel, to, her, brother, laban, s, house, in, haran, until, esau, s, anger, subsided, she, convinced, isaac, to, send, jacob, away, by, telling, him, that, she, despaired, of, his, marrying, a, local, girl, from, the, idol, worshipping, families, of, canaan, as, esau, had, done, after, isaac, sent, jacob, away, to, find, a, wife, esau, realized, his, own, canaanite, wives, were, evil, in, his, father, s, eyes, and, so, he, took, a, daughter, of, isaac, s, half, brother, ishmael, as, another, wife, near, luz, en, route, to, haran, jacob, experienced, a, vision, of, a, ladder, or, staircase, reaching, into, heaven, with, angels, going, up, and, down, it, subsequently, referred, to, in, popular, culture, as, jacob, s, ladder, he, heard, the, voice, of, god, who, repeated, many, of, the, blessings, upon, him, coming, from, the, top, of, the, ladder, according, to, pirkei, derabbi, eliezer, the, ladder, signified, the, exiles, that, the, jewish, people, would, suffer, before, the, coming, of, the, jewish, messiah, the, angels, that, represented, the, exiles, of, babylonia, persia, and, greece, each, climbed, up, a, certain, number, of, steps, paralleling, the, years, of, the, exile, before, they, fell, down, but, the, angel, representing, the, last, exile, that, of, edom, kept, climbing, higher, and, higher, into, the, clouds, jacob, feared, that, his, descendants, would, never, be, free, of, esau, s, domination, but, god, assured, him, that, at, the, end, of, days, edom, too, would, come, falling, down, in, the, morning, jacob, awakened, and, continued, on, his, way, to, haran, after, naming, the, place, where, he, had, spent, the, night, bethel, god, s, house, arriving, in, haran, jacob, saw, a, well, where, shepherds, were, gathering, their, flocks, to, water, them, and, met, laban, s, younger, daughter, rachel, jacob, s, first, cousin, she, was, working, as, a, shepherdess, jacob, was, 77, years, old, and, he, loved, rachel, immediately, after, spending, a, month, with, his, relatives, he, asked, for, her, hand, in, marriage, in, return, for, working, seven, years, for, laban, the, aramean, laban, agreed, to, the, arrangement, these, seven, years, seemed, to, jacob, but, a, few, days, for, the, love, he, had, for, her, when, they, were, complete, and, he, was, 84, years, old, he, asked, for, his, wife, but, laban, deceived, him, by, switching, rachel, for, her, older, sister, leah, as, the, veiled, bride, in, the, morning, when, the, truth, became, known, laban, justified, his, action, saying, that, in, his, country, it, was, unheard, of, to, give, a, younger, daughter, before, the, older, however, he, agreed, to, give, rachel, in, marriage, as, well, if, jacob, would, work, another, seven, years, after, the, week, of, wedding, celebrations, with, leah, jacob, married, rachel, and, he, continued, to, work, for, laban, for, another, seven, years, in, those, seven, years, jacob, fathered, twelve, children, he, loved, rachel, more, than, leah, and, leah, felt, hated, god, opened, leah, s, womb, and, she, gave, birth, to, four, sons, rapidly, reuben, simeon, levi, and, judah, rachel, however, remained, barren, following, the, example, of, sarah, who, gave, her, handmaid, to, abraham, after, years, of, infertility, rachel, gave, her, handmaid, bilhah, to, jacob, so, that, rachel, could, raise, children, through, her, bilhah, gave, birth, to, dan, and, naphtali, seeing, that, she, had, left, off, childbearing, temporarily, leah, then, gave, her, handmaid, zilpah, to, jacob, so, that, leah, could, raise, more, children, through, her, zilpah, gave, birth, to, gad, and, asher, afterwards, leah, became, fertile, again, and, gave, birth, to, issachar, zebulun, and, dinah, jacob, s, only, daughter, god, remembered, rachel, who, gave, birth, to, joseph, and, later, benjamin, after, joseph, was, born, jacob, decided, to, return, home, to, his, parents, laban, the, aramean, was, reluctant, to, release, him, as, god, had, blessed, his, flock, on, account, of, jacob, laban, asked, what, he, could, pay, jacob, jacob, suggested, that, all, the, spotted, speckled, and, brown, goats, and, sheep, of, laban, s, flock, at, any, given, moment, would, be, his, wages, jacob, placed, rods, of, poplar, hazel, and, chestnut, all, of, which, he, peeled, white, streaks, upon, them, within, the, flocks, watering, holes, or, troughs, associating, the, stripes, of, the, rods, with, the, growth, of, stripes, on, the, livestock, despite, this, practicing, of, magic, later, on, jacob, says, to, his, wives, that, it, was, god, who, made, the, livestock, give, birth, to, the, convenient, offspring, in, order, to, turn, the, tide, against, the, deceptive, laban, as, time, passed, laban, s, sons, noticed, that, jacob, was, taking, the, better, part, of, their, flocks, and, so, laban, s, friendly, attitude, towards, jacob, began, to, change, the, angel, of, the, lord, in, a, dream, back, during, the, breeding, season, told, jacob, now, lift, your, eyes, and, see, all, the, he, goats, mounting, the, animals, are, ringed, speckled, and, striped, for, i, have, seen, all, that, laban, is, doing, to, you, that, he, is, the, god, whom, jacob, met, at, bethel, and, that, jacob, should, leave, and, go, back, to, the, land, where, he, was, born, which, he, and, his, wives, and, children, did, without, informing, laban, before, they, left, rachel, stole, the, teraphim, considered, to, be, household, idols, from, laban, s, house, laban, pursued, jacob, for, seven, days, the, night, before, he, caught, up, to, him, god, appeared, to, laban, in, a, dream, and, warned, him, not, to, say, anything, good, or, bad, to, jacob, when, the, two, met, laban, said, to, jacob, what, have, you, done, that, you, have, tricked, me, and, driven, away, my, daughters, like, captives, of, the, sword, he, also, asked, for, his, stolen, teraphim, back, knowing, nothing, about, rachel, s, theft, jacob, told, laban, that, whoever, stole, them, should, die, and, stood, aside, to, let, him, search, when, laban, reached, rachel, s, tent, she, hid, the, teraphim, by, sitting, on, them, and, stating, she, could, not, get, up, because, she, was, menstruating, jacob, and, laban, then, parted, from, each, other, with, a, pact, to, preserve, the, peace, between, them, near, gilead, laban, returned, to, his, home, and, jacob, continued, on, his, way, as, jacob, neared, the, land, of, canaan, as, he, passed, mahanaim, he, sent, messengers, ahead, to, his, brother, esau, they, returned, with, the, news, that, esau, was, coming, to, meet, jacob, with, an, army, of, 400, men, with, great, apprehension, jacob, prepared, for, the, worst, he, engaged, in, earnest, prayer, to, god, then, sent, on, before, him, a, tribute, of, flocks, and, herds, to, esau, a, present, to, my, lord, esau, from, thy, servant, jacob, jacob, then, transported, his, family, and, flocks, across, the, ford, jabbok, by, night, then, recrossed, back, to, send, over, his, possessions, being, left, alone, in, communion, with, god, there, a, mysterious, being, appeared, man, genesis, 32, 24, 28, or, god, genesis, 32, 28, 30, hosea, 12, 3, 5, or, angel, hosea, 12, 4, and, the, two, wrestled, until, daybreak, when, the, being, saw, that, he, did, not, overpower, jacob, he, touched, jacob, on, the, sinew, of, his, thigh, the, gid, hanasheh, and, as, a, result, jacob, developed, a, limp, genesis, 32, 31, because, of, this, to, this, day, the, people, of, israel, do, not, eat, the, sinew, of, the, thigh, that, is, on, the, hip, socket, this, incident, is, the, source, of, the, mitzvah, of, porging, jacob, then, demanded, a, blessing, and, the, being, declared, in, genesis, 32, 28, that, from, then, on, jacob, would, be, called, israel, yisra, el, meaning, one, that, struggled, with, the, divine, angel, josephus, one, who, has, prevailed, with, god, rashi, a, man, seeing, god, whiston, he, will, rule, as, god, strong, or, a, prince, with, god, morris, from, hebrew, prevail, have, power, as, a, prince, while, he, is, still, called, jacob, in, later, texts, his, name, israel, makes, some, consider, him, the, eponymous, ancestor, of, the, israelites, jacob, asked, the, being, s, name, but, he, refused, to, answer, afterwards, jacob, named, the, place, penuel, penuw, el, peniy, el, meaning, face, of, god, saying, i, have, seen, god, face, to, face, and, lived, because, the, terminology, is, ambiguous, el, in, yisra, el, and, inconsistent, and, because, this, being, refused, to, reveal, his, name, there, are, varying, views, as, to, whether, he, was, a, man, an, angel, or, god, josephus, uses, only, the, terms, angel, divine, angel, and, angel, of, god, describing, the, struggle, as, no, small, victory, according, to, rashi, the, being, was, the, guardian, angel, of, esau, himself, sent, to, destroy, jacob, before, he, could, return, to, the, land, of, canaan, trachtenberg, theorized, that, the, being, refused, to, identify, itself, for, fear, that, if, its, secret, name, was, known, it, would, be, conjurable, by, incantations, literal, christian, interpreters, like, henry, m, morris, say, that, the, stranger, was, god, himself, and, therefore, christ, in, his, preincarnate, state, citing, jacob, s, own, evaluation, and, the, name, he, assumed, thereafter, one, who, fights, victoriously, with, god, and, adding, that, god, had, appeared, in, the, human, form, of, the, angel, of, the, lord, to, eat, a, meal, with, abraham, in, genesis, 18, geller, wrote, that, in, the, context, of, the, wrestling, bout, the, name, implies, that, jacob, won, this, supremacy, linked, to, that, of, god, s, by, a, kind, of, theomachy, in, the, morning, jacob, assembled, his, four, wives, and, 11, sons, placing, the, maidservants, and, their, children, in, front, leah, and, her, children, next, and, rachel, and, joseph, in, the, rear, some, commentators, cite, this, placement, as, proof, that, jacob, continued, to, favor, joseph, over, leah, s, children, as, presumably, the, rear, position, would, have, been, safer, from, a, frontal, assault, by, esau, which, jacob, feared, jacob, himself, took, the, foremost, position, esau, s, spirit, of, revenge, however, was, apparently, appeased, by, jacob, s, bounteous, gifts, of, camels, goats, and, flocks, their, reunion, was, an, emotional, one, esau, offered, to, accompany, them, on, their, way, back, to, israel, but, jacob, protested, that, his, children, were, still, young, and, tender, born, six, to, 13, years, prior, in, the, narrative, jacob, suggested, eventually, catching, up, with, esau, at, mount, seir, according, to, the, sages, this, was, a, prophetic, reference, to, the, end, of, days, when, jacob, s, descendants, will, come, to, mount, seir, the, home, of, edom, to, deliver, judgment, against, esau, s, descendants, for, persecuting, them, throughout, the, millennia, jacob, actually, diverted, himself, to, succoth, and, was, not, recorded, as, rejoining, esau, until, at, machpelah, the, two, bury, their, father, isaac, who, lived, to, be, 180, and, was, 60, years, older, than, they, were, jacob, then, arrived, in, shechem, where, he, bought, a, parcel, of, land, now, identified, as, joseph, s, tomb, in, shechem, jacob, s, daughter, dinah, was, kidnapped, and, raped, by, the, ruler, s, son, who, desired, to, marry, the, girl, dinah, s, brothers, simeon, and, levi, agreed, in, jacob, s, name, to, permit, the, marriage, as, long, as, all, the, men, of, shechem, first, circumcised, themselves, ostensibly, to, unite, the, children, of, jacob, in, abraham, s, covenant, of, familial, harmony, on, the, third, day, after, the, circumcisions, when, all, the, men, of, shechem, were, still, in, pain, simeon, and, levi, put, them, all, to, death, by, the, sword, and, rescued, their, sister, dinah, and, their, brothers, plundered, the, property, women, and, children, jacob, condemned, this, act, saying, you, have, brought, trouble, on, me, by, making, me, a, stench, to, the, canaanites, and, perizzites, the, people, living, in, this, land, he, later, rebuked, his, two, sons, for, their, anger, in, his, deathbed, blessing, genesis, 49, 5, 7, jacob, returned, to, bethel, where, he, had, another, vision, of, blessing, although, the, death, of, rebecca, jacob, s, mother, is, not, explicitly, recorded, in, the, bible, deborah, rebecca, s, nurse, died, and, was, buried, at, bethel, at, a, place, that, jacob, calls, allon, bachuth, oak, of, weepings, genesis, 35, 8, according, to, the, midrash, the, plural, form, of, the, word, weeping, indicates, the, double, sorrow, that, rebecca, also, died, at, this, time, jacob, then, made, a, further, move, while, rachel, was, pregnant, near, bethlehem, rachel, went, into, labor, and, died, as, she, gave, birth, to, her, second, son, benjamin, jacob, s, twelfth, son, jacob, buried, her, and, erected, a, monument, over, her, grave, rachel, s, tomb, just, outside, bethlehem, remains, a, popular, site, for, pilgrimages, and, prayers, to, this, day, jacob, then, settled, in, migdal, eder, where, his, firstborn, reuben, slept, with, rachel, s, servant, bilhah, jacob, s, response, was, not, given, at, the, time, but, he, did, condemn, reuben, for, it, later, in, his, deathbed, blessing, jacob, was, finally, reunited, with, his, father, isaac, in, mamre, outside, hebron, when, isaac, died, at, the, age, of, 180, jacob, and, esau, buried, him, in, the, cave, of, the, patriarchs, which, abraham, had, purchased, as, a, family, burial, plot, at, this, point, in, the, biblical, narrative, two, genealogies, of, esau, s, family, appear, under, the, headings, the, generations, of, esau, a, conservative, interpretation, is, that, at, isaac, s, burial, jacob, obtained, the, records, of, esau, who, had, been, married, 80, years, prior, and, incorporated, them, into, his, own, family, records, and, that, moses, augmented, and, published, them, the, house, of, jacob, dwelt, in, hebron, in, the, land, of, canaan, his, flocks, were, often, fed, in, the, pastures, of, shechem, as, well, as, dothan, of, all, the, children, in, his, household, he, loved, rachel, s, firstborn, son, joseph, the, most, thus, joseph, s, half, brothers, were, jealous, of, him, and, they, ridiculed, him, often, joseph, even, told, his, father, about, all, of, his, half, brothers, misdeeds, when, joseph, was, 17, years, old, jacob, made, a, long, coat, or, tunic, of, many, colors, for, him, seeing, this, the, half, brothers, began, to, hate, joseph, then, joseph, began, to, have, dreams, that, implied, that, his, family, would, bow, down, to, him, when, he, told, his, brothers, about, such, dreams, it, drove, them, to, conspire, against, him, when, jacob, heard, of, these, dreams, he, rebuked, his, son, for, proposing, the, idea, that, the, house, of, jacob, would, even, bow, down, to, joseph, yet, he, contemplated, his, son, s, words, about, these, dreams, sometime, afterward, the, sons, of, jacob, by, leah, bilhah, and, zilpah, were, feeding, his, flocks, in, shechem, jacob, wanted, to, know, how, things, were, doing, so, he, asked, joseph, to, go, down, there, and, return, with, a, report, this, was, the, last, time, he, would, ever, see, his, son, in, hebron, later, that, day, the, report, that, jacob, ended, up, receiving, came, from, joseph, s, brothers, who, brought, before, him, a, coat, laden, with, blood, jacob, identified, the, coat, as, the, one, he, made, for, joseph, at, that, moment, he, cried, it, is, my, son, s, tunic, a, wild, beast, has, devoured, him, without, doubt, joseph, is, torn, to, pieces, he, rent, his, clothes, and, put, sackcloth, around, his, waist, mourning, for, days, no, one, from, the, house, of, jacob, could, comfort, him, during, this, time, of, bereavement, the, truth, was, that, joseph, s, older, brothers, had, turned, on, him, apprehended, him, and, ultimately, sold, him, into, slavery, on, a, caravan, headed, for, egypt, twenty, years, later, throughout, the, middle, east, a, severe, famine, occurred, like, none, other, that, lasted, seven, years, it, crippled, nations, the, word, was, that, the, only, kingdom, prospering, was, egypt, in, the, second, year, of, this, great, famine, when, israel, jacob, was, about, 130, years, old, he, told, his, 10, sons, of, leah, bilhah, and, zilpah, to, go, to, egypt, and, buy, grain, israel, s, youngest, son, benjamin, born, from, rachel, stayed, behind, by, his, father, s, order, to, keep, him, safe, nine, of, the, sons, returned, to, their, father, israel, from, egypt, stockpiled, with, grain, on, their, donkeys, they, relayed, to, their, father, all, that, had, happened, in, egypt, they, spoke, of, being, accused, as, spies, and, that, their, brother, simeon, had, been, taken, prisoner, when, reuben, the, eldest, mentioned, that, they, needed, to, bring, benjamin, to, egypt, to, prove, their, word, as, honest, men, their, father, became, furious, with, them, he, couldn, t, understand, how, they, were, put, in, a, position, to, tell, the, egyptians, all, about, their, family, when, the, sons, of, israel, opened, their, sacks, they, saw, their, money, that, they, used, to, pay, for, the, grain, it, was, still, in, their, possession, and, so, they, all, became, afraid, israel, then, became, angry, with, the, loss, of, joseph, simeon, and, now, possibly, benjamin, it, turned, out, that, joseph, who, identified, his, brothers, in, egypt, was, able, to, secretly, return, the, money, that, they, used, to, pay, for, the, grain, back, to, them, when, the, house, of, israel, consumed, all, the, grain, that, they, brought, from, egypt, israel, told, his, sons, to, go, back, and, buy, more, this, time, judah, spoke, to, his, father, in, order, to, persuade, him, about, having, benjamin, accompany, them, so, as, to, prevent, egyptian, retribution, in, hopes, of, retrieving, simeon, and, ensuring, benjamin, s, return, israel, told, them, to, bring, the, best, fruits, of, their, land, including, balm, honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio, nuts, and, almonds, israel, also, mentioned, that, the, money, that, was, returned, to, their, money, sacks, was, probably, a, mistake, or, an, oversight, on, their, part, so, he, told, them, to, bring, that, money, back, and, use, double, that, amount, to, pay, for, the, new, grain, lastly, he, let, benjamin, go, with, them, and, said, may, god, almighty, give, you, mercy, if, i, am, bereaved, i, am, bereaved, when, the, sons, of, israel, jacob, returned, to, hebron, from, their, second, trip, they, came, back, with, 20, additional, donkeys, carrying, all, kinds, of, goods, and, supplies, as, well, as, egyptian, transport, wagons, when, their, father, came, out, to, meet, them, his, sons, told, him, that, joseph, was, still, alive, that, he, was, the, governor, over, all, of, egypt, and, that, he, wanted, the, house, of, israel, to, move, to, egypt, israel, s, heart, stood, still, and, just, couldn, t, believe, what, he, was, hearing, looking, upon, the, wagons, he, declared, joseph, my, son, is, still, alive, i, will, go, and, see, him, before, i, die, israel, and, his, entire, house, of, 70, gathered, up, with, all, their, livestock, and, began, their, journey, to, egypt, en, route, israel, stopped, at, beersheba, for, the, night, to, make, a, sacrificial, offering, to, his, god, yahweh, apparently, he, had, some, reservations, about, leaving, the, land, of, his, forefathers, but, god, reassured, him, not, to, fear, that, he, would, rise, again, god, also, assured, that, he, would, be, with, him, he, would, prosper, and, he, would, also, see, his, son, joseph, who, would, lay, him, to, rest, continuing, their, journey, to, egypt, when, they, approached, in, proximity, israel, sent, his, son, judah, ahead, to, find, out, where, the, caravans, were, to, stop, they, were, directed, to, disembark, at, goshen, it, was, here, after, 22, years, that, jacob, saw, his, son, joseph, once, again, they, embraced, each, other, and, wept, together, for, quite, a, while, israel, then, said, now, let, me, die, since, i, have, seen, your, face, because, you, are, still, alive, the, time, had, come, for, joseph, s, family, to, personally, meet, the, pharaoh, of, egypt, after, joseph, prepared, his, family, for, the, meeting, the, brothers, came, before, the, pharaoh, first, formally, requesting, to, pasture, in, egyptian, lands, the, pharaoh, honored, their, stay, and, even, made, the, notion, that, if, there, were, any, competent, men, in, their, house, then, they, may, elect, a, chief, herdsman, to, oversee, egyptian, livestock, finally, joseph, s, father, was, brought, out, to, meet, the, pharaoh, because, the, pharaoh, had, such, a, high, regard, for, joseph, practically, making, him, his, equal, it, was, an, honor, to, meet, his, father, thus, israel, was, able, to, bless, the, pharaoh, the, two, chatted, for, a, bit, the, pharaoh, even, inquiring, of, israel, s, age, which, happened, to, be, 130, years, old, at, that, time, after, the, meeting, the, families, were, directed, to, pasture, in, the, land, of, ramses, where, they, lived, in, the, province, of, goshen, the, house, of, israel, acquired, many, possessions, and, multiplied, exceedingly, during, the, course, of, 17, years, even, through, the, worst, of, the, seven, year, famine, israel, jacob, was, 147, years, old, when, he, called, to, his, favorite, son, joseph, and, pleaded, that, he, not, be, buried, in, egypt, rather, he, requested, to, be, carried, to, the, land, of, canaan, to, be, buried, with, his, forefathers, joseph, swore, to, do, as, his, father, asked, of, him, not, too, long, afterward, israel, had, fallen, ill, losing, much, of, his, vision, when, joseph, came, to, visit, his, father, he, brought, with, him, his, two, sons, ephraim, and, manasseh, israel, declared, that, they, would, be, heirs, to, the, inheritance, of, the, house, of, israel, as, if, they, were, his, own, children, just, as, reuben, and, simeon, were, then, israel, laid, his, right, hand, on, the, younger, ephraim, s, head, and, his, left, hand, on, the, eldest, manasseh, s, head, and, blessed, joseph, however, joseph, was, displeased, that, his, father, s, right, hand, was, not, on, the, head, of, his, firstborn, so, he, switched, his, father, s, hands, but, israel, refused, saying, but, truly, his, younger, brother, shall, be, greater, than, he, a, declaration, he, made, just, as, israel, himself, was, to, his, firstborn, brother, esau, then, israel, called, all, of, his, sons, in, and, prophesied, their, blessings, or, curses, to, all, twelve, of, them, in, order, of, their, ages, afterward, israel, died, and, the, family, including, the, egyptians, mourned, him, 70, days, israel, was, embalmed, for, 40, days, and, a, great, ceremonial, journey, to, canaan, was, prepared, by, joseph, he, led, the, servants, of, pharaoh, and, the, elders, of, the, houses, israel, and, egypt, beyond, the, jordan, river, to, atad, where, they, observed, seven, days, of, mourning, their, lamentation, was, so, great, that, it, caught, the, attention, of, surrounding, canaanites, who, remarked, this, is, a, deep, mourning, of, the, egyptians, this, spot, was, then, named, abel, mizraim, then, they, buried, him, in, the, cave, of, machpelah, the, property, of, abraham, when, he, bought, it, from, the, hittite, ephron, jacob, through, his, two, wives, and, his, two, concubines, had, 12, biological, sons, reuben, simeon, levi, judah, dan, naphtali, gad, asher, issachar, zebulun, joseph, and, benjamin, the, scene, of, jacob, mourning, joseph, makes, mention, of, him, having, a, number, of, daughters, but, no, details, are, provided, only, one, daughter, dinah, is, known, by, name, in, addition, jacob, also, adopted, the, two, sons, of, joseph, manasseh, and, ephraim, the, offspring, of, jacob, s, sons, became, the, tribes, of, israel, following, the, exodus, when, the, israelites, conquered, and, settled, in, the, land, of, israel, there, are, two, opinions, in, the, midrash, as, to, how, old, rebecca, was, at, the, time, of, her, marriage, and, consequently, at, the, twins, birth, according, to, the, traditional, counting, cited, by, rashi, isaac, was, 37, years, old, at, the, time, of, the, binding, of, isaac, and, news, of, rebecca, s, birth, reached, abraham, immediately, after, that, event, in, that, case, since, isaac, was, 60, when, jacob, and, esau, were, born, and, they, had, been, married, for, 20, years, then, isaac, was, 40, years, old, when, he, married, rebecca, gen, 25, 20, making, rebecca, three, years, old, at, the, time, of, her, marriage, and, 23, years, old, at, the, birth, of, jacob, and, esau, according, to, the, second, opinion, rebecca, was, 14, years, old, at, the, time, of, their, marriage, and, 34, years, old, at, the, birth, of, jacob, and, esau, in, either, case, isaac, and, rebecca, were, married, for, 20, years, before, jacob, and, esau, were, born, the, midrash, says, that, during, rebecca, s, pregnancy, whenever, she, would, pass, a, house, of, torah, study, jacob, would, struggle, to, come, out, whenever, she, would, pass, a, house, of, idolatry, esau, would, agitate, to, come, out, rashi, explained, that, isaac, when, blessing, jacob, instead, of, esau, smelled, the, heavenly, scent, of, gan, eden, paradise, when, jacob, entered, his, room, and, in, contrast, perceived, gehenna, opening, beneath, esau, when, the, latter, entered, the, room, showing, him, that, he, had, been, deceived, all, along, by, esau, s, show, of, piety, according, to, the, talmud, jacob, did, not, flee, directly, to, haran, as, would, seem, from, the, biblical, text, but, rather, studied, for, 14, years, at, the, study, house, of, shem, and, eber, before, continuing, towards, haran, when, laban, planned, to, deceive, jacob, into, marrying, leah, instead, of, rachel, the, midrash, recounts, that, both, jacob, and, rachel, suspected, that, laban, would, pull, such, a, trick, laban, was, known, as, the, aramean, deceiver, and, changed, jacob, s, wages, ten, times, during, his, employ, genesis, 31, 7, the, couple, therefore, devised, a, series, of, signs, by, which, jacob, could, identify, the, veiled, bride, on, his, wedding, night, but, when, rachel, saw, her, sister, being, taken, out, to, the, wedding, canopy, her, heart, went, out, to, her, for, the, public, shame, leah, would, suffer, if, she, were, exposed, rachel, therefore, gave, leah, the, signs, so, that, jacob, would, not, realize, the, switch, jacob, had, still, another, reason, for, grieving, the, loss, of, joseph, god, had, promised, to, him, if, none, of, your, sons, dies, during, your, lifetime, you, may, look, upon, it, as, a, token, that, you, will, not, be, put, in, hell, of, gehenna, after, your, death, thinking, joseph, to, be, dead, jacob, had, his, own, destiny, to, lament, because, he, considered, that, he, was, doomed, to, that, hell, jewish, apocalyptic, literature, of, the, hellenistic, period, includes, many, ancient, texts, with, narratives, about, jacob, many, times, with, details, different, from, genesis, the, more, important, are, the, book, of, jubilees, and, the, book, of, biblical, antiquities, jacob, is, also, the, protagonist, of, the, testament, of, jacob, of, the, ladder, of, jacob, and, of, the, prayer, of, joseph, which, interpret, the, experience, of, this, patriarch, in, the, context, of, merkabah, mysticism, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, those, eastern, catholic, churches, which, follow, the, byzantine, rite, see, jacob, s, dream, as, a, prophecy, of, the, incarnation, of, the, logos, whereby, jacob, s, ladder, is, understood, as, a, symbol, of, the, theotokos, virgin, mary, who, according, to, eastern, orthodox, theology, united, heaven, and, earth, in, her, womb, the, biblical, account, of, this, vision, is, one, of, the, standard, old, testament, readings, at, vespers, on, great, feasts, of, the, theotokos, the, eastern, and, western, churches, consider, jacob, as, a, saint, along, with, other, biblical, patriarchs, along, with, other, patriarchs, his, feast, day, is, celebrated, in, the, byzantine, rite, on, the, second, sunday, before, the, advent, december, 11, 17, under, the, title, the, sunday, of, the, forefathers, two, further, references, to, isra, il, arabic, classical, quranic, arabic, are, believed, to, be, mention, of, jacob, the, arabic, form, ya, q, b, arabic, romanized, ya, q, b, may, be, direct, from, the, hebrew, or, indirect, through, syriac, he, is, recognized, in, islam, as, a, prophet, who, received, inspiration, from, god, he, is, acknowledged, as, a, patriarch, of, islam, muslims, believe, that, he, preached, the, same, monotheistic, faith, as, his, forefathers, ibr, h, m, is, q, and, ism, l, jacob, is, mentioned, 16, times, in, the, quran, in, the, majority, of, these, references, jacob, is, mentioned, alongside, fellow, prophets, and, patriarchs, as, an, ancient, and, pious, prophet, according, to, the, quran, jacob, remained, in, the, company, of, the, elect, throughout, his, life, 38, 47, the, quran, specifically, mentions, that, jacob, was, guided, 6, 84, and, inspired, 4, 163, and, was, chosen, to, enforce, the, awareness, of, the, hereafter, 38, 46, jacob, is, described, as, a, good, doer, 21, 72, and, the, quran, further, makes, it, clear, that, god, inspired, jacob, to, contribute, towards, purification, and, hold, the, contact, prayer, 21, 73, jacob, is, further, described, as, being, resourceful, and, a, possessor, of, great, vision, 38, 45, and, is, further, spoken, of, as, being, granted, a, tongue, of, truthfulness, to, be, heard, 19, 50, of, the, life, of, jacob, the, quran, narrates, two, especially, important, events, the, first, is, the, role, he, plays, in, the, story, of, his, son, joseph, the, quran, narrates, the, story, of, joseph, in, detail, and, jacob, being, joseph, s, father, is, mentioned, thrice, and, is, referenced, another, 25, times, in, the, narrative, jacob, does, not, trust, some, of, his, older, sons, 12, 11, 18, 23, because, they, do, not, respect, him, 12, 8, 16, 17, jacob, s, prophetic, nature, is, evident, from, his, foreknowledge, of, joseph, s, future, greatness, 12, 6, his, foreboding, and, response, to, the, supposed, death, of, joseph, 12, 13, 18, and, in, his, response, to, the, sons, plight, in, egypt, 12, 83, 86, 87, 96, islamic, literature, fleshes, out, the, narrative, of, jacob, and, mentions, that, his, wives, included, rachel, jacob, is, later, mentioned, in, the, quran, in, the, context, of, the, promise, bestowed, to, zechariah, regarding, the, birth, of, john, the, baptist, 19, 6, jacob, s, second, mention, is, in, the, quran, s, second, chapter, as, jacob, lay, on, his, deathbed, he, asked, his, 12, sons, to, testify, their, faith, to, him, before, he, departed, from, this, world, to, the, next, 2, 132, each, son, testified, in, front, of, jacob, that, they, would, promise, to, remain, muslim, in, submission, to, god, until, the, day, of, their, death, that, is, they, would, surrender, their, wholeselves, to, god, alone, and, would, worship, only, him, in, contrast, to, the, judeo, christian, view, of, jacob, one, main, difference, is, that, the, story, of, jacob, s, blessing, in, which, he, deceives, isaac, is, not, accepted, in, islam, the, quran, makes, it, clear, that, jacob, was, blessed, by, god, as, a, prophet, and, therefore, muslims, believe, that, his, father, being, a, prophet, as, well, also, knew, of, his, son, s, greatness, jacob, is, also, cited, in, the, hadith, as, an, example, of, one, who, was, patient, and, trusting, in, god, in, the, face, of, suffering, according, to, the, teachings, of, the, nation, of, islam, noi, the, original, inhabitants, of, the, world, were, black, referred, to, as, the, asiatic, blackman, while, the, white, race, are, devils, who, were, created, 6, 000, years, ago, on, what, is, today, the, greek, island, of, patmos, by, the, biblical, and, quranic, jacob, whom, the, group, refers, to, as, the, bigheaded, scientist, yakub, though, rejected, by, the, vast, majority, of, american, muslims, several, noi, breakaway, sects, including, the, five, percent, nation, subscribe, to, this, narrative, in, contrast, to, both, the, bible, and, qu, ran, noi, theology, teaches, that, yakub, was, born, in, mecca, although, archaeologist, and, biblical, scholar, william, f, albright, maintained, c, 1961, that, the, narratives, of, abraham, and, jacob, could, be, dated, to, about, the, 19th, century, bce, john, j, bimson, wrote, in, 1980, since, then, there, has, been, a, strong, reaction, against, the, use, of, archaeological, evidence, in, support, of, the, biblical, traditions, and, albright, s, comment, could, not, be, repeated, with, any, truth, today, nahum, m, sarna, 1978, noted, that, an, inability, to, date, the, narratives, of, the, patriarchs, does, not, necessarily, invalidate, their, historicity, a, view, supported, by, bimson, who, admitted, that, our, knowledge, of, the, centuries, around, 2000, bce, is, very, small, and, our, ignorance, very, great, gerhard, von, rad, in, his, old, testament, theology, 1962, postulated, that, the, patriarchal, narratives, describe, actual, events, subsequently, interpreted, by, the, community, through, its, own, experience, other, scholars, such, as, thomas, l, thompson, view, the, narratives, as, late, literary, compositions, 6th, and, 5th, centuries, bce, that, have, ideological, and, theological, purposes, but, are, unreliable, for, historical, reconstruction, of, the, pre, settlement, period, of, the, israelites, in, the, historicity, of, the, patriarchal, narratives, 1974, thompson, suggested, that, the, narratives, arose, in, a, response, to, some, emergent, situation, expressed, as, an, imaginative, picture, of, the, past, to, embody, hope, in, the, ascent, of, man, 1973, jacob, bronowski, pointed, out, similarities, between, jacob, and, bakhtyar, who, lends, his, name, to, iran, s, bakhtiari, people, both, were, herdsmen, who, had, two, wives, and, are, regarded, as, the, ancestral, patriarch, of, their, nomadic, people, archaeologist, william, g, dever, wrote, in, 2001, after, a, century, of, exhaustive, investigation, all, respectable, archaeologists, have, given, up, hope, of, recovering, any, context, that, would, make, abraham, isaac, or, jacob, historical, figures, excavations, in, the, timna, valley, produced, what, may, be, the, earliest, camel, bones, found, in, israel, or, even, outside, the, arabian, peninsula, dating, to, around, 930, bce, this, is, seen, by, some, as, evidence, that, the, stories, of, abraham, jacob, and, joseph, said, to, have, taken, place, a, thousand, years, earlier, were, written, no, earlier, than, the, 10th, century, bce, israel, finkelstein, proposed, the, jacob, esau, narratives, could, have, originated, from, 8th, century, bce, kingdom, of, israel, because, the, conflict, with, edom, fits, well, not, only, in, a, judahite, context, but, also, in, 8th, century, bce, israelite, context, other, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, story, could, fit, also, in, a, 2nd, millennium, bce, context, finkelstein, suggests, there, is, an, archaeological, evidence, that, 8th, century, israel, interacted, with, edom, the, graffiti, of, kuntillet, ajrud, that, mention, both, a, yhwh, of, samaria, center, of, israel, and, a, yhwh, of, teman, center, of, edom, he, proposed, the, jacob, laban, narrative, might, stem, from, the, 8th, century, bce, as, haran, was, then, the, western, capital, of, the, assyrian, empire, he, also, proposed, that, the, earliest, layer, of, jacob, cycle, or, the, oldest, jacob, tradition, which, is, the, story, of, him, and, his, uncle, laban, establishing, the, border, between, them, might, be, a, pre, monarchic, tradition, and, could, be, originated, from, gilead
