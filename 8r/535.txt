the, tiger, shark, galeocerdo, cuvier, is, a, species, of, ground, shark, and, the, only, extant, member, of, the, genus, galeocerdo, and, family, galeocerdonidae, it, is, a, large, macropredator, with, females, capable, of, attaining, a, length, of, over, 5, m, 16, ft, 5, in, populations, are, found, in, many, tropical, and, temperate, waters, especially, around, central, pacific, islands, its, name, derives, from, the, dark, stripes, down, its, body, which, resemble, a, tiger, s, pattern, but, fade, as, the, shark, matures, the, tiger, shark, is, a, solitary, mostly, nocturnal, hunter, it, is, notable, for, having, the, widest, food, spectrum, of, all, sharks, with, a, range, of, prey, that, includes, crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, sea, snakes, dolphins, and, even, other, smaller, sharks, it, also, has, a, reputation, as, a, garbage, eater, consuming, a, variety, of, inedible, man, made, objects, that, linger, in, its, stomach, tiger, sharks, have, only, one, recorded, natural, predator, the, orca, it, is, considered, a, near, threatened, species, because, of, finning, and, fishing, by, humans, the, tiger, shark, is, second, only, to, the, great, white, in, recorded, fatal, attacks, on, humans, but, these, events, are, still, exceedingly, rare, the, shark, was, first, described, by, peron, and, lesueur, in, 1822, and, was, given, the, name, squalus, cuvier, m, ller, and, henle, in, 1837, renamed, it, galeocerdo, tigrinus, the, genus, galeocerdo, is, derived, from, the, greek, galeos, which, means, shark, and, kerdo, the, word, for, fox, it, is, often, colloquially, called, the, man, eater, shark, the, tiger, shark, is, a, member, of, the, order, carcharhiniformes, the, most, species, rich, order, of, sharks, with, more, than, 270, species, also, including, the, small, catsharks, and, hammerhead, sharks, members, of, this, order, are, characterized, by, the, presence, of, a, nictitating, membrane, over, the, eyes, two, dorsal, fins, an, anal, fin, and, five, gill, slits, it, is, the, largest, member, of, the, order, commonly, referred, to, as, ground, sharks, it, is, the, only, extant, member, of, galeocerdo, the, only, member, of, the, family, galeocerdonidae, the, oldest, remains, of, galeocerdo, extend, back, to, the, eocene, epoch, while, the, oldest, fossils, of, the, modern, tiger, shark, galeocerdo, cuvier, date, to, the, middle, miocene, around, 13, 8, million, years, ago, the, tiger, shark, commonly, attains, adult, length, of, 3, 5, to, 4, 7, m, 11, ft, 6, in, 15, ft, 5, in, and, weighs, between, 300, and, 900, kg, 700, and, 2, 000, lb, the, international, game, fish, association, s, all, tackle, record, is, 810, kg, 1, 790, lb, it, is, sexually, dimorphic, with, females, being, the, larger, sex, mature, females, are, often, over, 3, 7, m, 12, ft, 2, in, while, mature, males, rarely, get, that, large, exceptionally, large, females, reportedly, can, measure, over, 5, m, 16, ft, 5, in, and, the, largest, males, 4, m, 13, ft, 1, in, weights, of, particularly, large, female, tiger, sharks, can, exceed, 1, 300, kg, 2, 900, lb, one, pregnant, female, caught, off, australia, reportedly, measured, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, 1, in, long, and, weighed, 1, 524, kg, 3, 360, lb, even, larger, unconfirmed, catches, have, been, claimed, some, papers, have, accepted, a, record, of, an, exceptional, 7, 4, metre, 24, ft, 3, in, 3, 110, kilogram, 6, 860, lb, tiger, shark, but, since, this, is, far, larger, than, any, scientifically, observed, specimen, verification, would, be, needed, a, 2019, study, suggested, that, pliocene, tiger, sharks, could, have, reached, 8, m, 26, ft, in, maximum, length, there, is, variation, in, the, speed, of, growth, rates, of, juvenile, tiger, sharks, depending, on, the, region, they, inhabit, with, some, growing, close, to, twice, as, fast, as, others, among, the, largest, extant, sharks, the, tiger, shark, ranks, in, average, size, only, behind, the, whale, shark, rhincodon, typus, the, basking, shark, cetorhinus, maximus, and, the, great, white, shark, carcharodon, carcharias, this, makes, it, the, second, largest, predatory, shark, after, the, great, white, some, other, species, such, as, megamouth, sharks, megachasma, pelagios, pacific, sleeper, sharks, somniosus, pacificus, greenland, sharks, somniosus, microcephalus, and, bluntnose, sixgill, sharks, hexanchus, griseus, broadly, overlap, in, size, with, the, tiger, shark, but, as, these, species, are, comparatively, poorly, studied, whether, their, typical, mature, size, matches, that, of, the, tiger, shark, is, unclear, the, great, hammerhead, sphyrna, mokarran, a, member, of, the, same, taxonomic, order, as, the, tiger, shark, has, a, similar, or, even, greater, average, body, length, but, is, lighter, and, less, bulky, with, a, maximum, known, weight, coming, from, a, heavily, pregnant, 4, 4, m, 14, ft, long, individual, at, 580, kg, 1, 280, lb, tiger, shark, teeth, are, unique, with, very, sharp, pronounced, serrations, and, an, unmistakable, sideways, pointing, tip, such, dentition, has, developed, to, slice, through, flesh, bone, and, other, tough, substances, such, as, turtle, shells, like, most, sharks, its, teeth, are, continually, replaced, by, rows, of, new, teeth, throughout, the, shark, s, life, relative, to, the, shark, s, size, tiger, shark, teeth, are, considerably, shorter, than, those, of, a, great, white, shark, but, they, are, nearly, as, broad, as, the, root, as, the, great, white, s, teeth, and, are, arguably, better, suited, to, slicing, through, hard, surfaced, prey, a, tiger, shark, generally, has, long, fins, to, provide, lift, as, the, shark, maneuvers, through, water, while, the, long, upper, tail, provides, bursts, of, speed, the, tiger, shark, normally, swims, using, small, body, movements, the, skin, of, a, tiger, shark, can, typically, range, from, blue, to, light, green, with, a, white, or, light, yellow, underbelly, the, advantage, of, this, is, that, when, it, is, hunting, for, its, prey, when, prey, looks, at, the, shark, from, above, the, shark, will, be, camouflaged, since, the, water, below, is, darker, when, prey, is, below, the, shark, and, looks, up, the, light, underbelly, will, also, camouflage, the, shark, with, the, sunlight, this, is, known, as, countershading, dark, spots, and, stripes, are, most, visible, in, young, sharks, and, fade, as, the, shark, matures, its, head, is, somewhat, wedge, shaped, which, makes, it, easy, to, turn, quickly, to, one, side, they, have, small, pits, on, the, snout, which, hold, electroreceptors, called, the, ampullae, of, lorenzini, which, enable, them, to, detect, electric, fields, including, the, weak, electrical, impulses, generated, by, prey, which, helps, them, to, hunt, tiger, sharks, also, have, a, sensory, organ, called, a, lateral, line, which, extends, on, their, flanks, down, most, of, the, length, of, their, sides, the, primary, role, of, this, structure, is, to, detect, minute, vibrations, in, the, water, these, adaptations, allow, the, tiger, shark, to, hunt, in, darkness, and, detect, hidden, prey, sharks, do, not, have, moveable, upper, or, lower, eyelids, but, the, tiger, shark, among, other, sharks, has, a, nictitating, membrane, a, clear, eyelid, that, can, cover, the, eye, a, reflective, layer, behind, the, tiger, shark, s, retina, called, the, tapetum, lucidum, allows, light, sensing, cells, a, second, chance, to, capture, photons, of, visible, light, this, enhances, vision, in, low, light, conditions, the, tiger, shark, is, often, found, close, to, the, coast, mainly, in, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, throughout, the, world, its, behavior, is, primarily, nomadic, but, is, guided, by, warmer, currents, and, it, stays, closer, to, the, equator, throughout, the, colder, months, it, tends, to, stay, in, deep, waters, that, line, reefs, but, it, does, move, into, channels, to, pursue, prey, in, shallower, waters, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, the, shark, has, been, found, as, far, north, as, japan, and, as, far, south, as, new, zealand, it, has, also, been, recorded, in, the, mediterranean, sea, but, rarely, off, malaga, spain, sicily, italy, and, libya, tiger, sharks, can, be, seen, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, north, american, beaches, and, parts, of, south, america, it, is, also, commonly, observed, in, the, caribbean, sea, other, locations, where, tiger, sharks, are, seen, include, off, africa, china, india, australia, and, indonesia, certain, tiger, sharks, have, been, recorded, at, depths, just, shy, of, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, the, tiger, shark, is, an, apex, predator, and, has, a, reputation, for, eating, almost, anything, these, predators, swim, close, inland, to, eat, at, night, and, during, the, day, swim, out, into, deeper, waters, young, tiger, sharks, are, found, to, feed, largely, on, small, fish, as, well, as, various, small, jellyfish, and, mollusks, including, cephalopods, around, the, time, they, attain, 2, 3, m, 7, 5, ft, or, near, sexual, maturity, their, selection, expands, considerably, and, much, larger, animals, become, regular, prey, numerous, fish, crustaceans, sea, birds, sea, snakes, marine, mammals, e, g, bottlenose, dolphins, tursiops, common, dolphins, delphinus, spotted, dolphins, stenella, dugongs, dugong, dugon, seals, and, sea, lions, and, sea, turtles, including, the, three, largest, species, the, leatherback, dermochelys, coriacea, the, loggerhead, caretta, caretta, and, the, green, sea, turtles, chelonia, mydas, are, regularly, eaten, by, adult, tiger, sharks, in, fact, adult, sea, turtles, have, been, found, in, up, to, 20, 8, of, studied, tiger, shark, stomachs, indicating, somewhat, of, a, dietary, preference, for, sea, turtles, where, they, are, commonly, encountered, they, also, eat, other, sharks, including, adult, sandbar, sharks, carcharhinus, plumbeus, as, well, as, rays, and, sometimes, even, other, tiger, sharks, due, to, high, risk, of, predation, dolphins, often, avoid, regions, inhabited, by, tiger, sharks, injured, or, ailing, whales, may, also, be, attacked, and, eaten, a, group, was, documented, killing, an, ailing, humpback, whale, megaptera, novaeangliae, in, 2006, near, hawaii, a, scavenger, the, tiger, shark, will, feed, on, dead, whales, and, has, been, documented, doing, so, alongside, great, white, sharks, evidence, of, dugong, predation, was, identified, in, one, study, that, found, dugong, tissue, in, 15, of, 85, tiger, sharks, caught, off, the, australian, coast, additionally, examination, of, adult, dugongs, has, shown, scars, from, failed, shark, attacks, to, minimize, attacks, dugong, microhabitats, shift, similarly, to, those, of, known, tiger, shark, prey, when, the, sharks, are, abundant, the, broad, heavily, calcified, jaws, and, nearly, terminal, mouth, combined, with, robust, serrated, teeth, enable, the, tiger, shark, to, take, on, these, large, prey, in, addition, excellent, eyesight, and, acute, sense, of, smell, enable, it, to, react, to, faint, traces, of, blood, and, follow, them, to, the, source, the, ability, to, pick, up, low, frequency, pressure, waves, enables, the, shark, to, advance, towards, an, animal, with, confidence, even, in, murky, water, the, shark, circles, its, prey, and, studies, it, by, prodding, it, with, its, snout, when, attacking, the, shark, often, eats, its, prey, whole, although, larger, prey, are, often, eaten, in, gradual, large, bites, and, finished, over, time, notably, terrestrial, mammals, including, horses, equus, ferus, caballus, goats, capra, aegagrus, hircus, sheep, ovis, aries, dogs, canis, lupus, familiaris, cats, felis, catus, and, brown, rats, rattus, norvegicus, are, fairly, common, in, the, stomach, contents, of, tiger, sharks, around, the, coasts, of, hawaii, in, one, case, remains, of, two, flying, foxes, were, found, in, the, stomach, of, this, shark, because, of, its, aggressive, and, indiscriminate, feeding, style, it, often, mistakenly, eats, inedible, objects, such, as, automobile, license, plates, oil, cans, tires, and, baseballs, due, to, their, habits, of, eating, essentially, anything, tiger, sharks, are, often, referred, to, as, the, garbage, can, of, the, sea, tiger, sharks, are, preyed, on, by, orcas, orcas, have, been, recorded, hunting, and, killing, tiger, sharks, by, holding, them, upside, down, to, induce, tonic, immobility, in, order, to, drown, the, shark, the, orcas, bite, off, the, shark, s, fins, before, disemboweling, and, devouring, it, all, tiger, sharks, generally, swim, slowly, which, combined, with, cryptic, coloration, may, make, them, difficult, for, prey, to, detect, in, some, habitats, they, are, especially, well, camouflaged, against, dark, backgrounds, despite, their, sluggish, appearance, tiger, sharks, are, one, of, the, strongest, swimmers, of, the, carcharhinid, sharks, once, the, shark, has, come, close, a, speed, burst, allows, it, to, reach, the, intended, prey, before, it, can, escape, males, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 2, 3, to, 2, 9, m, 7, 5, to, 9, 5, ft, and, females, at, 2, 5, to, 3, 5, m, 8, 2, to, 11, 5, ft, typical, weight, of, relatively, young, sexually, mature, specimens, which, often, locally, comprise, the, majority, of, tiger, sharks, encountered, per, game, fishing, and, scientific, studies, is, around, 80, to, 130, kg, 180, to, 290, lb, females, mate, once, every, three, years, they, breed, by, internal, fertilization, the, male, inserts, one, of, his, claspers, into, the, female, s, genital, opening, cloaca, acting, as, a, guide, for, the, sperm, the, male, uses, his, teeth, to, hold, the, female, still, during, the, procedure, often, causing, the, female, considerable, discomfort, mating, in, the, northern, hemisphere, generally, takes, place, between, march, and, may, with, birth, between, april, and, june, the, following, year, in, the, southern, hemisphere, mating, takes, place, in, november, december, or, early, january, the, tiger, shark, is, the, only, species, in, its, family, that, is, ovoviviparous, its, eggs, hatch, internally, and, the, young, are, born, live, when, fully, developed, tiger, sharks, are, unique, among, all, sharks, in, the, fact, that, they, employ, embrytrophy, to, nourish, their, young, inside, the, womb, the, young, gestate, in, sacks, which, are, filled, with, a, fluid, that, nourishes, them, this, allows, for, the, young, to, dramatically, increase, in, size, even, though, they, have, no, placental, connection, to, the, mother, the, young, develop, inside, the, mother, s, body, up, to, 16, months, litters, range, from, 10, to, 80, pups, a, newborn, is, generally, 51, to, 76, cm, 20, to, 30, in, long, how, long, tiger, sharks, live, is, unknown, but, they, can, live, longer, than, 12, years, tiger, shark, ontogeny, has, been, little, studied, until, recently, but, studies, by, hammerschlag, et, al, indicated, that, as, they, grow, their, tails, become, more, symmetrical, with, age, additionally, while, the, heads, on, juvenile, tiger, sharks, are, more, conical, and, similar, to, other, requiem, sharks, adult, tiger, sharks, have, a, head, which, is, relatively, broader, the, reason, for, the, larger, caudal, fin, on, juvenile, tiger, sharks, is, theorized, to, be, an, adaptation, to, escape, predation, by, larger, predators, and, to, catch, quicker, moving, prey, as, tiger, sharks, mature, their, head, also, becomes, much, wider, and, their, tails, no, longer, become, as, large, in, proportion, to, their, body, size, as, when, they, are, juveniles, because, they, do, not, face, elevated, levels, of, predation, risk, upon, maturity, the, results, of, this, study, were, interpreted, as, reflecting, two, ecological, transitions, as, tiger, sharks, mature, they, become, more, migratory, and, having, a, symmetrical, tail, is, more, advantageous, in, long, distance, traveling, and, that, tiger, sharks, consume, more, diverse, prey, items, with, age, which, requires, a, greater, bite, force, and, broader, head, the, tiger, shark, is, captured, and, killed, for, its, fins, flesh, and, liver, it, is, caught, regularly, in, target, and, nontarget, fisheries, several, populations, have, declined, where, they, have, been, heavily, fished, continued, demand, for, fins, may, result, in, further, declines, they, are, considered, a, near, threatened, species, due, to, excessive, finning, and, fishing, by, humans, according, to, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, in, june, 2018, the, new, zealand, department, of, conservation, classified, the, tiger, shark, as, migrant, with, the, qualifier, secure, overseas, under, the, new, zealand, threat, classification, system, while, shark, fin, has, very, few, nutrients, shark, liver, has, a, high, concentration, of, vitamin, a, which, is, used, in, the, production, of, vitamin, oils, in, addition, the, tiger, shark, is, captured, and, killed, for, its, distinct, skin, as, well, as, by, big, game, fishers, in, 2010, greenpeace, international, added, the, tiger, shark, to, its, seafood, red, list, which, is, a, list, of, commonly, sold, fish, likely, to, come, from, unsustainable, fisheries, although, sharks, rarely, bite, humans, the, tiger, shark, is, reported, to, be, responsible, for, a, large, share, of, fatal, shark, bite, incidents, and, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, dangerous, shark, species, they, often, visit, shallow, reefs, harbors, and, canals, creating, the, potential, for, encounter, with, humans, the, tiger, shark, also, dwells, in, river, mouths, and, other, runoff, rich, water, while, it, ranks, second, on, the, list, of, number, of, recorded, shark, attacks, on, humans, behind, only, the, great, white, shark, such, attacks, are, few, and, very, seldom, fatal, typically, three, to, four, shark, bites, occur, per, year, in, hawaii, one, notable, survivor, of, such, an, attack, is, surfing, champion, bethany, hamilton, who, lost, her, left, arm, at, age, 13, to, a, tiger, shark, in, 2003, this, bite, rate, is, very, low, considering, that, thousands, of, people, swim, surf, and, dive, in, hawaiian, waters, every, day, human, interactions, with, tiger, sharks, in, hawaiian, waters, have, been, shown, to, increase, between, september, and, november, when, tiger, shark, females, are, believed, to, migrate, to, the, islands, to, give, birth, on, 8, june, 2023, a, tiger, shark, attacked, and, killed, a, 23, year, old, russian, man, in, the, red, sea, off, the, coast, of, the, egyptian, city, of, hurghada, the, attack, was, filmed, by, onlookers, and, the, recording, went, viral, the, shark, was, later, captured, by, fishermen, and, killed, this, was, the, third, fatal, tiger, shark, attack, in, the, area, since, 2022, between, 1959, and, 1976, 4, 668, tiger, sharks, were, culled, in, the, state, of, hawaii, in, an, effort, to, protect, the, tourism, industry, despite, damaging, the, shark, population, these, efforts, were, shown, to, be, ineffective, in, decreasing, the, number, of, interactions, between, humans, and, tiger, sharks, feeding, sharks, in, hawaii, except, for, traditional, hawaiian, cultural, or, religious, practices, is, illegal, and, interaction, with, them, such, as, cage, diving, is, discouraged, south, african, shark, behaviorist, and, shark, diver, mark, addison, demonstrated, divers, could, interact, and, dive, with, them, outside, of, a, shark, cage, in, a, 2007, discovery, channel, special, and, underwater, photographer, fiona, ayerst, swam, with, them, in, the, bahamas, at, tiger, beach, off, grand, bahama, uncaged, diving, with, and, even, the, handling, of, female, tiger, sharks, has, become, a, routine, occurrence, warming, atlantic, ocean, currents, have, caused, tiger, shark, migration, paths, to, move, further, north, according, to, a, university, of, miami, study, tiger, sharks, are, considered, to, be, sacred, aum, kua, ancestor, spirits, by, some, native, hawaiians, tiger, sharks, possess, a, unique, significance, as, aumakua, revered, as, family, guardians, in, hawaiian, culture, the, tiger, shark, regarded, as, an, intelligent, and, highly, perceptive, spiritual, entity, assumes, the, role, of, a, messenger, bridging, the, gap, between, humans, and, the, divine, in, the, hawaiian, belief, system, aumakua, take, on, various, forms, either, animals, or, objects, representing, ancestral, connections, and, manifestations, of, departed, family, members, this, perspective, underscores, the, intricate, web, of, interdependence, among, plants, animals, elements, and, humans, underscoring, the, imperative, to, honor, and, coexist, harmoniously, with, nature
