31, currently, recognized, see, list, the, western, honey, bee, or, european, honey, bee, apis, mellifera, is, the, most, common, of, the, 7, 12, species, of, honey, bees, worldwide, the, genus, name, apis, is, latin, for, bee, and, mellifera, is, the, latin, for, honey, bearing, or, honey, carrying, referring, to, the, species, production, of, honey, like, all, honey, bee, species, the, western, honey, bee, is, eusocial, creating, colonies, with, a, single, fertile, female, or, queen, many, normally, non, reproductive, females, or, workers, and, a, small, proportion, of, fertile, males, or, drones, individual, colonies, can, house, tens, of, thousands, of, bees, colony, activities, are, organized, by, complex, communication, between, individuals, through, both, pheromones, and, the, dance, language, the, western, honey, bee, was, one, of, the, first, domesticated, insects, and, it, is, the, primary, species, maintained, by, beekeepers, to, this, day, for, both, its, honey, production, and, pollination, activities, with, human, assistance, the, western, honey, bee, now, occupies, every, continent, except, antarctica, western, honey, bees, are, threatened, by, pests, and, diseases, especially, the, varroa, mite, and, colony, collapse, disorder, there, are, indications, that, the, species, is, rare, if, not, extinct, in, the, wild, in, europe, and, as, of, 2014, the, western, honey, bee, was, assessed, as, data, deficient, on, the, iucn, red, list, numerous, studies, indicate, that, the, species, has, undergone, significant, declines, in, europe, however, it, is, not, clear, if, they, refer, to, population, reduction, of, wild, or, managed, colonies, further, research, is, required, to, enable, differentiation, between, wild, and, non, wild, colonies, in, order, to, determine, the, conservation, status, of, the, species, in, the, wild, meaning, self, sustaining, without, treatments, or, management, western, honey, bees, are, an, important, model, organism, in, scientific, studies, particularly, in, the, fields, of, social, evolution, learning, and, memory, they, are, also, used, in, studies, of, pesticide, toxicity, especially, via, pollen, to, assess, non, target, impacts, of, commercial, pesticides, the, western, honey, bee, can, be, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, the, species, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, africa, or, asia, and, it, spread, naturally, through, africa, the, middle, east, and, europe, humans, are, responsible, for, its, considerable, additional, range, introducing, european, subspecies, into, north, america, early, 1600s, south, america, australia, new, zealand, and, eastern, asia, western, honey, bees, adapted, to, the, local, environments, as, they, spread, geographically, these, adaptations, include, synchronizing, colony, cycles, to, the, timing, of, local, flower, resources, forming, a, winter, cluster, in, colder, climates, migratory, swarming, in, africa, and, enhanced, foraging, behavior, in, desert, areas, all, together, these, variations, resulted, in, 31, recognized, subspecies, previously, it, was, believed, that, the, various, subspecies, were, all, cross, fertile, but, in, 2013, it, was, found, that, the, a, m, mellifera, queens, do, not, mate, with, non, a, m, mellifera, drones, the, subspecies, are, divided, into, four, major, branches, based, on, work, by, ruttner, and, confirmed, by, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, african, subspecies, belong, to, branch, a, northwestern, european, subspecies, branch, m, southwestern, european, subspecies, branch, c, and, middle, eastern, subspecies, branch, o, unlike, most, other, bee, species, western, honey, bees, have, perennial, colonies, which, persist, year, after, year, because, of, this, high, degree, of, sociality, and, permanence, western, honey, bee, colonies, can, be, considered, superorganisms, this, means, that, reproduction, of, the, colony, rather, than, individual, bees, is, the, biologically, significant, unit, western, honey, bee, colonies, reproduce, through, a, process, called, swarming, in, most, climates, western, honey, bees, swarm, in, the, spring, and, early, summer, when, there, is, an, abundance, of, blooming, flowers, from, which, to, collect, nectar, and, pollen, in, response, to, these, favorable, conditions, the, hive, creates, one, to, two, dozen, new, queens, just, as, the, pupal, stages, of, these, daughter, queens, are, nearly, complete, the, old, queen, and, approximately, two, thirds, of, the, adult, workers, leave, the, colony, in, a, swarm, traveling, some, distance, to, find, a, new, location, suitable, for, building, a, hive, e, g, a, hollow, tree, trunk, in, the, old, colony, the, daughter, queens, often, start, piping, just, prior, to, emerging, as, adults, and, when, the, daughter, queens, eventually, emerge, they, fight, each, other, until, only, one, remains, the, survivor, then, becomes, the, new, queen, if, one, of, the, sisters, emerges, before, the, others, she, may, kill, her, siblings, while, they, are, still, pupae, before, they, have, a, chance, to, emerge, as, adults, once, she, has, dispatched, all, of, her, rivals, the, new, queen, the, only, fertile, female, lays, all, the, eggs, for, the, old, colony, which, her, mother, has, left, virgin, females, are, able, to, lay, eggs, which, develop, into, males, a, trait, found, in, bees, wasps, and, ants, because, of, haplodiploidy, however, she, requires, a, mate, to, produce, female, offspring, which, comprise, 90, or, more, of, bees, in, the, colony, at, any, given, time, thus, the, new, queen, goes, on, one, or, more, nuptial, flights, each, time, mating, with, 1, 17, drones, once, she, has, finished, mating, usually, within, two, weeks, of, emerging, she, remains, in, the, hive, playing, the, primary, role, of, laying, eggs, throughout, the, rest, of, the, growing, season, the, colony, produces, many, workers, who, gather, pollen, and, nectar, as, cold, season, food, the, average, population, of, a, healthy, hive, in, midsummer, may, be, as, high, as, 40, 000, to, 80, 000, bees, nectar, from, flowers, is, processed, by, worker, bees, who, evaporate, it, until, the, moisture, content, is, low, enough, to, discourage, mold, transforming, it, into, honey, which, can, then, be, capped, over, with, wax, and, stored, almost, indefinitely, in, the, temperate, climates, to, which, western, honey, bees, are, adapted, the, bees, gather, in, their, hive, and, wait, out, the, cold, season, during, which, the, queen, may, stop, laying, during, this, time, activity, is, slow, and, the, colony, consumes, its, stores, of, honey, used, for, metabolic, heat, production, in, the, cold, season, in, mid, through, late, winter, the, queen, starts, laying, again, this, is, probably, triggered, by, day, length, depending, on, the, subspecies, new, queens, and, swarms, may, be, produced, every, year, or, less, frequently, depending, on, local, environmental, conditions, and, a, number, of, characteristics, inside, the, hive, like, other, insects, that, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, the, western, honey, bee, has, four, distinct, life, stages, egg, larva, pupa, and, adult, the, complex, social, structure, of, western, honey, bee, hives, means, that, all, of, these, life, stages, occur, simultaneously, throughout, much, of, the, year, the, queen, deposits, a, single, egg, into, each, cell, of, a, honeycomb, prepared, by, worker, bees, the, egg, hatches, into, a, legless, eyeless, larva, fed, by, nurse, bees, worker, bees, who, maintain, the, interior, of, the, colony, after, about, a, week, the, larva, is, sealed, in, its, cell, by, the, nurse, bees, and, begins, its, pupal, stage, after, another, week, it, emerges, as, an, adult, bee, it, is, common, for, defined, regions, of, the, comb, to, be, filled, with, young, bees, also, called, brood, while, others, are, filled, with, pollen, and, honey, stores, worker, bees, secrete, the, wax, used, to, build, the, hive, clean, maintain, and, guard, it, raise, the, young, and, forage, for, nectar, and, pollen, the, nature, of, the, worker, s, role, varies, with, age, for, the, first, 10, days, of, their, lives, worker, bees, clean, the, hive, and, feed, the, larvae, after, this, they, begin, building, comb, cells, on, days, 16, through, 20, workers, receive, nectar, and, pollen, from, older, workers, and, store, it, after, the, 20th, day, a, worker, leaves, the, hive, and, spends, the, remainder, of, its, life, as, a, forager, although, worker, bees, are, usually, infertile, females, when, some, subspecies, are, stressed, they, may, lay, fertile, eggs, since, workers, are, not, fully, sexually, developed, they, do, not, mate, with, drones, and, thus, can, only, produce, haploid, male, offspring, queens, and, workers, have, a, modified, ovipositor, called, a, stinger, with, which, they, defend, the, hive, unlike, those, of, bees, of, any, other, genus, and, of, the, queens, of, their, own, species, the, stinger, of, worker, western, honey, bees, is, barbed, contrary, to, popular, belief, a, bee, does, not, always, die, soon, after, stinging, this, misconception, is, based, on, the, fact, that, a, bee, will, usually, die, after, stinging, a, human, or, other, mammal, the, stinger, and, its, venom, sac, with, musculature, and, a, ganglion, allowing, them, to, continue, delivering, venom, after, they, are, detached, are, designed, to, pull, free, of, the, body, when, they, lodge, this, apparatus, including, barbs, on, the, stinger, is, thought, to, have, evolved, in, response, to, predation, by, vertebrates, since, the, barbs, do, not, function, and, the, stinger, apparatus, does, not, detach, unless, the, stinger, is, embedded, in, elastic, material, the, barbs, do, not, always, catch, so, a, bee, may, occasionally, pull, its, stinger, free, and, fly, off, unharmed, or, sting, again, although, the, average, lifespan, of, a, queen, in, most, subspecies, is, three, to, five, years, reports, from, the, german, honey, bee, subspecies, a, m, mellifera, previously, used, for, beekeeping, indicate, that, a, queen, can, live, up, to, eight, years, because, a, queen, s, store, of, sperm, is, depleted, near, the, end, of, her, life, she, begins, laying, more, unfertilized, eggs, for, this, reason, beekeepers, often, replace, queens, every, year, or, two, the, lifespan, of, workers, varies, considerably, over, the, year, in, regions, with, long, winters, workers, born, in, spring, and, summer, work, hard, and, live, only, a, few, weeks, but, those, born, in, autumn, remain, inside, for, several, months, as, the, colony, clusters, on, average, during, the, year, about, 1, of, a, colony, s, worker, bees, die, naturally, per, day, except, for, the, queen, all, of, a, colony, s, workers, are, replaced, about, every, four, months, behavioral, and, physiological, differences, between, castes, and, subcastes, arise, from, phenotypic, plasticity, which, relies, on, gene, expression, rather, than, heritable, genotypic, differences, the, queen, bee, is, a, fertile, female, who, unlike, workers, which, are, also, female, has, a, fully, developed, reproductive, system, she, is, larger, than, her, workers, and, has, a, characteristic, rounder, longer, abdomen, a, female, egg, can, become, either, a, queen, or, a, worker, bee, workers, and, queen, larvae, are, both, fed, royal, jelly, which, is, high, in, protein, and, low, in, flavonoids, during, the, first, three, days, after, that, larval, prospective, workers, are, switched, to, a, diet, of, mixed, pollen, and, nectar, often, called, bee, bread, while, prospective, queens, continue, to, receive, royal, jelly, in, the, absence, of, flavonoids, and, the, presence, of, a, high, protein, diet, female, bees, grow, into, queens, by, developing, the, vigorous, reproductive, system, necessary, to, maintain, a, colony, of, tens, of, thousands, of, daughter, workers, periodically, the, colony, determines, that, a, new, queen, is, needed, there, are, three, general, causes, emergency, supersedure, can, generally, be, recognized, because, new, queen, cells, are, built, out, from, comb, cells, instead, of, hanging, from, the, bottom, of, a, frame, regardless, of, the, trigger, workers, develop, existing, larvae, into, queens, by, continuing, to, feed, them, royal, jelly, rather, than, switching, them, to, bee, bread, and, by, extending, the, selected, larvae, s, cells, to, house, the, developing, larger, bodied, queens, queens, are, not, raised, in, the, typical, horizontal, brood, cells, of, the, honeycomb, a, queen, cell, is, larger, and, oriented, vertically, if, workers, sense, that, an, old, queen, is, weakening, they, produce, emergency, cells, known, as, supersedure, cells, from, cells, with, eggs, or, young, larvae, and, which, protrude, from, the, comb, when, the, queen, finishes, her, larval, feeding, and, pupates, she, moves, into, a, head, downward, position, and, later, chews, her, way, out, of, the, cell, at, pupation, workers, cap, seal, the, cell, the, queen, asserts, control, over, the, worker, bees, by, releasing, a, complex, suite, of, pheromones, known, as, queen, scent, after, several, days, of, orientation, in, and, around, the, hive, the, young, queen, flies, to, a, drone, congregation, area, a, site, near, a, clearing, and, generally, about, 30, feet, 9, 1, m, above, the, ground, where, drones, from, different, hives, congregate, they, detect, the, presence, of, a, queen, in, their, congregation, area, by, her, smell, find, her, by, sight, and, mate, with, her, in, midair, drones, can, be, induced, to, mate, with, dummy, queens, with, the, queen, pheromone, a, queen, will, mate, multiple, times, and, may, leave, to, mate, several, days, in, a, row, weather, permitting, until, her, spermatheca, is, full, the, queen, lays, all, the, eggs, in, a, healthy, colony, the, number, and, pace, of, egg, laying, is, controlled, by, weather, resource, availability, and, specific, racial, characteristics, queens, generally, begin, to, slow, egg, laying, in, the, early, fall, and, may, stop, during, the, winter, egg, laying, generally, resumes, in, late, winter, when, the, days, lengthen, peaking, in, the, spring, at, the, height, of, the, season, the, queen, may, lay, over, 2, 500, eggs, per, day, more, than, her, body, mass, she, fertilizes, each, egg, with, stored, sperm, from, the, spermatheca, as, it, is, laid, in, a, worker, sized, cell, eggs, laid, in, drone, sized, larger, cells, are, left, unfertilized, these, unfertilized, eggs, with, half, as, many, genes, as, queen, or, worker, eggs, develop, into, drones, workers, are, females, produced, by, the, queen, that, develop, from, fertilized, diploid, eggs, workers, are, essential, for, social, structure, and, proper, colony, functioning, they, carry, out, the, main, tasks, of, the, colony, because, the, queen, is, occupied, solely, with, reproducing, these, females, raise, their, sister, workers, and, future, queens, that, eventually, leave, the, nest, to, start, their, own, colony, they, also, forage, and, return, to, the, nest, with, nectar, and, pollen, to, feed, the, young, and, defend, the, colony, drones, are, the, colony, s, male, bees, since, they, do, not, have, ovipositors, they, do, not, have, stingers, drone, honey, bees, do, not, forage, for, nectar, or, pollen, the, primary, purpose, of, a, drone, is, to, fertilize, a, new, queen, many, drones, mate, with, a, given, queen, in, flight, each, dies, immediately, after, mating, since, the, process, of, insemination, requires, a, lethally, convulsive, effort, drone, honey, bees, are, haploid, single, unpaired, chromosomes, in, their, genetic, structure, and, are, descended, only, from, their, mother, the, queen, in, temperate, regions, drones, are, generally, expelled, from, the, hive, before, winter, dying, of, cold, and, starvation, since, they, cannot, forage, produce, honey, or, care, for, themselves, given, their, larger, size, 1, 5, times, that, of, worker, bees, inside, the, hive, it, is, believed, that, drones, may, play, a, significant, role, in, thermoregulation, drones, are, typically, located, near, the, center, of, hive, clusters, for, unclear, reasons, it, is, postulated, that, it, is, to, maintain, sperm, viability, which, may, be, compromised, at, cooler, temperatures, another, possible, explanation, is, that, a, more, central, location, allows, drones, to, contribute, to, warmth, since, at, temperatures, below, 25, c, 77, f, their, ability, to, contribute, declines, when, a, fertile, female, worker, produces, drones, a, conflict, arises, between, her, interests, and, those, of, the, queen, the, worker, shares, one, half, of, her, genes, with, the, drone, and, one, quarter, with, her, brothers, favouring, her, offspring, over, those, of, the, queen, the, queen, shares, one, half, of, her, genes, with, her, sons, and, one, quarter, with, the, sons, of, fertile, female, workers, this, pits, the, worker, against, the, queen, and, other, workers, who, try, to, maximize, their, reproductive, fitness, by, rearing, the, offspring, most, related, to, them, this, relationship, leads, to, a, phenomenon, called, worker, policing, in, these, rare, situations, other, worker, bees, in, the, hive, who, are, genetically, more, related, to, the, queen, s, sons, than, those, of, the, fertile, workers, patrol, the, hive, and, remove, worker, laid, eggs, another, form, of, worker, policing, is, aggression, toward, fertile, females, some, studies, suggest, a, queen, pheromone, which, may, help, workers, distinguish, worker, laid, and, queen, laid, eggs, but, others, indicate, egg, viability, as, the, key, factor, in, eliciting, the, behavior, worker, policing, is, an, example, of, forced, altruism, where, the, benefits, of, worker, reproduction, are, minimized, and, that, of, rearing, the, queen, s, offspring, maximized, in, very, rare, instances, workers, subvert, the, policing, mechanisms, of, the, hive, laying, eggs, faster, than, other, workers, remove, them, this, is, known, as, anarchic, syndrome, anarchic, workers, can, activate, their, ovaries, at, a, higher, rate, and, contribute, a, greater, proportion, of, males, to, the, hive, although, an, increase, in, the, number, of, drones, decreases, the, overall, productivity, of, the, hive, it, increases, the, reproductive, fitness, of, the, drones, mother, anarchic, syndrome, is, an, example, of, selection, working, in, opposite, directions, at, the, individual, and, group, levels, for, the, stability, of, the, hive, under, ordinary, circumstances, if, the, queen, dies, or, is, removed, reproduction, in, workers, increases, because, a, significant, proportion, of, workers, then, have, activated, ovaries, the, workers, produce, a, last, batch, of, drones, before, the, hive, collapses, although, during, this, period, worker, policing, is, usually, absent, in, certain, groups, of, bees, it, continues, according, to, the, strategy, of, kin, selection, worker, policing, is, not, favored, if, a, queen, mates, just, once, in, that, case, workers, are, related, by, three, quarters, of, their, genes, and, the, sons, of, workers, are, related, more, than, usual, to, sons, of, the, queen, then, the, benefit, of, policing, is, negated, experiments, confirming, this, hypothesis, have, shown, a, correlation, between, higher, mating, rates, and, increased, rates, of, worker, policing, in, many, species, of, social, hymenoptera, the, western, honey, bee, needs, an, internal, body, temperature, of, 35, c, 95, f, to, fly, this, temperature, is, maintained, in, the, nest, to, develop, the, brood, and, is, the, optimal, temperature, for, the, creation, of, wax, the, temperature, on, the, periphery, of, the, cluster, varies, with, outside, air, temperature, and, the, winter, cluster, s, internal, temperature, may, be, as, low, as, 20, 22, c, 68, 72, f, western, honey, bees, can, forage, over, a, 30, c, 86, f, air, temperature, range, because, of, behavioral, and, physiological, mechanisms, for, regulating, the, temperature, of, their, flight, muscles, from, low, to, high, air, temperatures, the, mechanisms, are, shivering, before, flight, and, stopping, flight, for, additional, shivering, passive, body, temperature, regulation, based, on, work, and, evaporative, cooling, from, regurgitated, honey, sac, contents, body, temperatures, differ, depending, on, caste, and, expected, foraging, rewards, the, optimal, air, temperature, for, foraging, is, 22, 25, c, 72, 77, f, during, flight, the, bee, s, relatively, large, flight, muscles, create, heat, which, must, be, dissipated, the, honey, bee, uses, evaporative, cooling, to, release, heat, through, its, mouth, under, hot, conditions, heat, from, the, thorax, is, dissipated, through, the, head, the, bee, regurgitates, a, droplet, of, warm, internal, fluid, a, honeycrop, droplet, which, reduces, the, temperature, of, its, head, by, 10, c, 18, f, below, 7, 10, c, 45, 50, f, bees, are, immobile, and, above, 38, c, 100, f, their, activity, slows, western, honey, bees, can, tolerate, temperatures, up, to, 50, c, 122, f, for, short, periods, they, lack, the, thermal, defense, exhibited, by, apis, cerana, but, at, least, one, subspecies, apis, mellifera, cypria, is, capable, of, killing, invading, hornets, through, asphyxiation, despite, not, being, able, to, attain, lethal, temperatures, apis, mellifera, honey, bees, with, high, amounts, of, flight, experience, exhibit, increased, dna, damage, in, flight, muscle, as, measured, by, elevated, 8, oxo, 2, deoxyguanosine, compared, to, bees, with, less, flight, experience, this, increased, dna, damage, is, likely, due, to, an, imbalance, of, pro, and, anti, oxidants, during, flight, associated, oxidative, stress, flight, induced, oxidative, dna, damage, appears, to, hasten, senescence, and, limit, lifespan, in, a, mellifera, western, honey, bee, behavior, has, been, extensively, studied, karl, von, frisch, who, received, the, 1973, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, study, of, honey, bee, communication, noticed, that, bees, communicate, with, dance, through, these, dances, bees, communicate, information, regarding, the, distance, the, situation, and, the, direction, of, a, food, source, by, the, dances, of, the, returning, honey, bee, worker, bee, on, the, vertical, comb, of, the, hive, honey, bees, direct, other, bees, to, food, sources, with, the, round, dance, and, the, waggle, dance, although, the, round, dance, tells, other, foragers, that, food, is, within, 50, metres, 160, ft, of, the, hive, it, provides, insufficient, information, about, direction, the, waggle, dance, which, may, be, vertical, or, horizontal, provides, more, detail, about, the, distance, and, direction, of, a, food, source, foragers, are, also, thought, to, rely, on, their, olfactory, sense, to, help, locate, a, food, source, after, they, are, directed, by, the, dances, western, honey, bees, also, change, the, precision, of, the, waggle, dance, to, indicate, the, type, of, site, that, is, set, as, a, new, goal, their, close, relatives, dwarf, honey, bees, do, not, therefore, western, honey, bees, seem, to, have, evolved, a, better, means, of, conveying, information, than, their, common, ancestors, with, the, dwarf, honey, bee, another, means, of, communication, is, the, shaking, signal, also, known, as, the, jerking, dance, vibration, dance, or, vibration, signal, although, the, shaking, signal, is, most, common, in, worker, communication, it, also, appears, in, reproductive, swarming, a, worker, bee, vibrates, its, body, dorsoventrally, while, holding, another, bee, with, its, front, legs, jacobus, biesmeijer, who, examined, shaking, signals, in, a, forager, s, life, and, the, conditions, leading, to, its, performance, found, that, experienced, foragers, executed, 92, of, observed, shaking, signals, and, 64, of, these, signals, were, made, after, the, discovery, of, a, food, source, about, 71, of, shaking, signals, occurred, before, the, first, five, successful, foraging, flights, of, the, day, other, communication, signals, such, as, the, waggle, dance, were, performed, more, often, after, the, first, five, successes, biesmeijer, demonstrated, that, most, shakers, are, foragers, and, the, shaking, signal, is, most, often, executed, by, foraging, bees, on, pre, foraging, bees, concluding, that, it, is, a, transfer, message, for, several, activities, or, activity, levels, sometimes, the, signal, increases, activity, as, when, active, bees, shake, inactive, ones, at, other, times, such, as, the, end, of, the, day, the, signal, is, an, inhibitory, mechanism, however, the, shaking, signal, is, preferentially, directed, towards, inactive, bees, all, three, forms, of, communication, among, honey, bees, are, effective, in, foraging, and, task, management, pheromones, substances, involved, in, chemical, communication, are, essential, to, honey, bee, survival, western, honey, bees, rely, on, pheromones, for, nearly, all, behaviors, including, mating, alarm, defense, orientation, kin, and, colony, recognition, food, production, and, integrating, colony, activities, the, alarm, pheromone, has, shown, to, be, attractive, small, hive, beetle, therefore, there, is, a, tradeoff, between, recruiting, guards, bees, to, defend, the, invaders, and, attract, more, beetles, small, hive, beetle, has, a, lower, sensing, threshold, for, the, honeybee, pheromone, which, exacerbates, the, damage, to, honeybee, hive, there, is, some, degree, of, variability, of, sociality, between, individuals, like, a, great, many, other, social, insects, a, mellifera, engages, in, trophallaxis, when, the, duration, of, trophallaxis, pairings, was, measured, it, was, found, that, like, human, social, interactions, there, are, durable, long, term, trends, for, each, individual, bee, there, is, less, inter, individual, variation, than, found, in, humans, however, possibly, reflecting, the, higher, genetic, relatedness, between, hivema, humans, have, been, collecting, honey, from, western, honey, bees, for, thousands, of, years, with, evidence, in, the, form, of, rock, art, found, in, france, and, spain, dating, to, around, 7, 000, bce, the, western, honey, bee, is, one, of, the, few, invertebrate, animals, to, have, been, domesticated, bees, were, likely, first, domesticated, in, ancient, egypt, where, tomb, paintings, depict, beekeeping, before, 2600, bc, europeans, brought, bees, to, north, america, in, 1622, beekeepers, have, selected, western, honey, bees, for, several, desirable, features, these, modifications, along, with, artificial, change, of, location, have, improved, western, honey, bees, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, beekeeper, and, simultaneously, made, them, more, dependent, on, beekeepers, for, their, survival, in, europe, cold, weather, survival, was, likely, selected, for, consciously, or, not, while, in, africa, selection, probably, favoured, the, ability, to, survive, heat, drought, and, heavy, rain, authors, do, not, agree, on, whether, this, degree, of, artificial, selection, constitutes, genuine, domestication, in, 1603, john, guillim, wrote, the, bee, i, may, well, reckon, a, domestic, insect, being, so, pliable, to, the, benefit, of, the, keeper, more, recently, many, biologists, working, on, pollination, take, the, domesticated, status, of, western, honey, bees, for, granted, for, example, rachael, winfree, and, colleagues, write, we, used, crop, pollination, as, a, model, system, and, investigated, whether, the, loss, of, a, domesticated, pollinator, the, honey, bee, could, be, compensated, for, by, native, wild, bee, species, similarly, brian, dennis, and, william, kemp, write, although, the, domestication, of, the, honey, bee, is, closely, connected, to, the, evolution, of, food, based, socio, economic, systems, in, many, cultures, throughout, the, world, in, current, economic, terms, and, in, the, u, s, alone, the, estimated, wholesale, value, of, honey, more, than, 317, million, dollars, in, 2013, pales, in, comparison, to, aggregate, estimated, annual, value, of, pollination, services, variously, valued, at, 11, 15, billion, on, the, other, hand, p, r, oxley, and, b, p, oldroyd, 2010, consider, the, domestication, of, western, honey, bees, at, best, partial, oldroyd, observes, that, the, lack, of, full, domestication, is, somewhat, surprising, given, that, people, have, kept, bees, for, at, least, 7, 000, years, instead, beekeepers, have, found, ways, to, manage, bees, using, hives, while, the, bees, remain, largely, unchanged, from, their, wild, cousins, leslie, bailey, and, b, v, ball, in, their, book, honey, bee, pathology, call, western, honey, bees, feral, insects, in, contrast, to, the, domestic, silk, moth, bombyx, mori, which, they, call, the, only, insect, that, has, been, domesticated, and, refer, to, the, popular, belief, among, many, biologists, as, well, as, beekeepers, that, bees, are, domesticated, they, argue, that, western, honey, bees, are, able, to, survive, without, human, help, and, in, fact, require, to, be, left, at, liberty, to, survive, further, they, argue, that, even, if, bees, could, be, raised, away, from, the, wild, they, would, still, have, to, fly, freely, to, gather, nectar, and, pollinate, plants, therefore, they, argue, beekeeping, is, the, exploitation, of, colonies, of, a, wild, insect, with, little, more, than, the, provision, of, a, weatherproof, cavity, for, them, to, nest, in, likewise, pilar, de, la, rua, and, colleagues, argue, that, western, honey, bees, are, not, fully, domesticated, because, endemic, subspecies, specific, genetic, footprints, can, still, be, identified, in, europe, and, africa, making, conservation, of, wild, bee, diversity, important, further, they, argue, that, the, difficulty, of, controlling, drones, for, mating, is, a, serious, handicap, and, a, sign, that, domestication, is, not, complete, in, particular, as, extensive, gene, flow, usually, occurs, between, wild, feral, and, managed, honeybee, populations, the, western, honey, bee, is, a, colonial, insect, which, is, housed, transported, by, and, sometimes, fed, by, beekeepers, honey, bees, do, not, survive, and, reproduce, individually, but, as, part, of, the, colony, a, superorganism, western, honey, bees, collect, flower, nectar, and, convert, it, to, honey, which, is, stored, in, the, hive, the, nectar, transported, in, the, bees, stomachs, is, converted, with, the, addition, of, digestive, enzymes, and, storage, in, a, honey, cell, for, partial, dehydration, nectar, and, honey, provide, the, energy, for, the, bees, flight, muscles, and, for, heating, the, hive, during, the, winter, western, honey, bees, also, collect, pollen, which, after, being, processed, to, bee, bread, supplies, protein, and, fat, for, the, bee, brood, to, grow, centuries, of, selective, breeding, by, humans, have, created, western, honey, bees, which, produce, far, more, honey, than, the, colony, needs, and, beekeepers, also, known, as, apiarists, harvest, the, surplus, honey, beekeepers, provide, a, place, for, the, colony, to, live, and, store, honey, there, are, seven, basic, types, of, beehive, skeps, langstroth, hives, top, bar, hives, box, hives, log, gums, d, e, hives, and, miller, hives, all, u, s, states, require, beekeepers, to, use, movable, frames, to, allow, bee, inspectors, to, check, the, brood, for, disease, this, allows, beekeepers, to, keep, langstroth, top, bar, and, d, e, hives, without, special, permission, granted, for, purposes, such, as, museum, use, modern, hives, also, enable, beekeepers, to, transport, bees, moving, from, field, to, field, as, crops, require, pollinating, a, source, of, income, for, beekeepers, in, cold, climates, some, beekeepers, have, kept, colonies, alive, with, varying, degrees, of, success, by, moving, them, indoors, for, winter, while, this, can, protect, the, colonies, from, extremes, of, temperature, and, make, winter, care, and, feeding, more, convenient, for, the, beekeeper, it, increases, the, risk, of, dysentery, and, causes, an, excessive, buildup, of, carbon, dioxide, from, the, bees, respiration, inside, wintering, has, been, refined, by, canadian, beekeepers, who, use, large, barns, solely, for, the, wintering, of, bees, automated, ventilation, systems, assist, in, carbon, dioxide, dispersal, honey, bees, are, one, of, the, products, of, a, beehive, they, can, be, purchased, as, mated, queens, in, spring, packages, of, a, queen, along, with, two, to, five, pounds, 0, 91, to, 2, 27, kg, of, honey, bees, as, nucleus, colonies, which, include, frames, of, brood, or, as, full, colonies, commerce, of, western, honey, bees, dates, back, to, as, early, as, 1622, when, the, first, colonies, of, bees, were, shipped, from, england, to, virginia, modern, methods, of, producing, queens, and, dividing, colonies, for, increase, date, back, to, the, late, 1800s, honey, was, extracted, by, killing, off, the, hive, and, bees, and, bee, products, were, mainly, an, object, of, local, trade, the, first, commercial, beekeeper, in, the, united, states, is, considered, moses, quinby, of, new, york, who, experimented, with, movable, box, hives, which, allow, extraction, without, killing, the, hive, the, improvements, in, roads, and, motor, vehicles, after, world, war, i, allowed, commercial, beekeepers, to, expand, the, size, of, their, businesses, the, western, honey, bee, is, an, important, pollinator, of, crops, this, service, accounts, for, much, of, the, species, commercial, value, in, 2005, the, estimated, commercial, value, of, western, honey, bees, was, just, under, 200, billion, worldwide, a, large, number, of, the, crop, species, farmed, worldwide, depend, on, it, although, orchards, and, fields, have, increased, in, size, wild, pollinators, have, dwindled, in, a, number, of, regions, the, pollination, shortage, is, addressed, by, migratory, beekeepers, who, supply, hives, during, a, crop, bloom, and, move, them, after, the, blooming, period, commercial, beekeepers, plan, their, movements, and, wintering, locations, according, to, anticipated, pollination, services, at, higher, latitudes, it, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, overwinter, sufficient, bees, or, to, have, them, ready, for, early, blooming, plants, much, migration, is, seasonal, with, hives, wintering, in, warmer, climates, and, moving, to, follow, the, bloom, at, higher, latitudes, in, california, almond, pollination, occurs, in, february, early, in, the, growing, season, before, local, hives, have, built, up, their, populations, almond, orchards, require, two, hives, per, acre, or, 2, 000, m, 2, 22, 000, sq, ft, per, hive, for, maximum, yield, and, pollination, is, dependent, on, the, importation, of, hives, from, warmer, climates, almond, pollination, in, february, and, march, in, the, u, s, is, the, largest, managed, pollination, event, in, the, world, requiring, more, than, one, third, of, all, managed, honey, bees, in, the, country, bees, are, also, moved, en, masse, for, pollination, of, apples, in, new, york, michigan, and, washington, despite, honey, bees, inefficiency, as, blueberry, pollinators, large, numbers, are, moved, to, maine, because, they, are, the, only, pollinators, who, can, be, easily, moved, and, concentrated, for, this, and, other, monoculture, crops, bees, and, other, insects, maintain, flower, constancy, by, transferring, pollen, to, other, biologically, specific, plants, this, prevents, flower, stigmas, from, being, clogged, with, pollen, from, other, species, in, 2000, drs, roger, morse, and, nicholas, calderone, of, cornell, university, attempted, to, quantify, the, effects, of, the, western, honey, bee, on, only, us, food, crops, their, calculations, came, up, with, a, figure, of, us, 14, 6, billion, in, food, crop, value, honey, is, the, complex, substance, made, from, nectar, and, sweet, deposits, from, plants, and, trees, which, are, gathered, modified, and, stored, in, the, comb, by, honey, bees, honey, is, a, biological, mixture, of, inverted, sugars, primarily, glucose, and, fructose, it, has, antibacterial, and, anti, fungal, properties, honey, from, the, western, honey, bee, along, with, the, bee, tetragonisca, angustula, has, specific, antibacterial, activity, towards, an, infection, causing, bacteria, staphylococcus, aureus, honey, will, not, rot, or, ferment, when, stored, under, normal, conditions, but, it, will, crystallize, over, time, although, crystallized, honey, is, acceptable, for, human, use, bees, can, only, use, liquid, honey, and, will, remove, and, discard, any, crystallized, honey, from, the, hive, bees, produce, honey, by, collecting, nectar, a, clear, liquid, consisting, of, nearly, 80, percent, water, and, complex, sugars, the, collecting, bees, store, the, nectar, in, a, second, stomach, and, return, to, the, hive, where, worker, bees, remove, the, nectar, the, worker, bees, digest, the, raw, nectar, for, about, 30, minutes, using, digestive, enzymes, to, break, down, the, complex, sugars, into, simpler, ones, raw, honey, is, then, spread, in, empty, honeycomb, cells, to, dry, reducing, its, water, content, to, less, than, 20, percent, when, nectar, is, being, processed, honey, bees, create, a, draft, through, the, hive, by, fanning, with, their, wings, when, the, honey, has, dried, the, honeycomb, cells, are, sealed, capped, with, wax, to, preserve, it, mature, worker, bees, secrete, beeswax, from, glands, on, their, abdomen, using, it, to, form, the, walls, and, caps, of, the, comb, when, honey, is, harvested, the, wax, can, be, collected, for, use, in, products, like, candles, and, seals, bees, collect, pollen, in, a, pollen, basket, and, carry, it, back, to, the, hive, where, after, undergoing, fermentation, and, turning, into, bee, bread, it, becomes, a, protein, source, for, brood, rearing, excess, pollen, can, be, collected, from, the, hive, although, it, is, sometimes, consumed, as, a, dietary, supplement, by, humans, bee, pollen, may, cause, an, allergic, reaction, in, susceptible, individuals, bee, brood, the, eggs, larvae, or, pupae, of, honey, bees, is, edible, and, highly, nutritious, bee, brood, contains, the, same, amount, of, protein, that, beef, or, poultry, does, bee, brood, is, often, harvested, as, a, byproduct, when, the, beekeeper, has, excess, bees, and, does, not, wish, to, have, any, more, propolis, is, a, resinous, mixture, collected, by, honey, bees, from, tree, buds, sap, flows, or, other, botanical, sources, which, is, used, as, a, sealant, for, unwanted, open, spaces, in, the, hive, although, propolis, is, alleged, to, have, health, benefits, tincture, of, propolis, is, marketed, as, a, cold, and, flu, remedy, it, may, cause, severe, allergic, reactions, in, some, individuals, propolis, is, also, used, in, wood, finishes, and, gives, a, stradivarius, violin, its, unique, red, color, royal, jelly, is, a, honey, bee, secretion, used, to, nourish, the, larvae, and, queen, it, is, marketed, for, its, alleged, but, unsupported, claims, of, health, benefits, on, the, other, hand, it, may, cause, severe, allergic, reactions, in, some, individuals, female, bees, are, diploid, and, have, 32, chromosomes, whereas, males, are, haploid, and, have, only, 16, as, of, october, 28, 2006, the, honey, bee, genome, sequencing, consortium, fully, sequenced, and, analyzed, the, genome, of, apis, mellifera, the, western, honey, bee, since, 2007, attention, has, been, devoted, to, colony, collapse, disorder, a, decline, in, western, honey, bee, colonies, in, a, number, of, regions, the, western, honey, bee, is, the, third, insect, after, the, fruit, fly, and, the, mosquito, whose, genome, has, been, mapped, according, to, scientists, who, analyzed, its, genetic, code, the, honey, bee, originated, in, africa, and, spread, to, europe, in, two, ancient, migrations, scientists, have, found, that, genes, related, to, smell, outnumber, those, for, taste, and, the, european, honey, bee, has, fewer, genes, regulating, immunity, than, the, fruit, fly, and, the, mosquito, the, genome, sequence, also, revealed, that, several, groups, of, genes, particularly, those, related, to, circadian, rhythm, resembled, those, of, vertebrates, more, than, other, insects, another, significant, finding, from, the, honey, bee, genome, study, was, that, the, western, honey, bee, was, the, first, insect, to, be, discovered, with, a, functional, dna, methylation, system, since, functional, key, enzymes, dna, methyltransferase, 1, and, 3, were, identified, in, the, genome, dna, methylation, is, one, of, the, important, mechanisms, in, epigenetics, to, study, gene, expression, and, regulation, without, changing, the, dna, sequence, but, modifications, on, dna, activity, dna, methylation, later, was, identified, to, play, an, important, role, in, gene, regulation, and, gene, splicing, the, genome, is, unusual, in, having, few, transposable, elements, although, they, were, present, in, the, evolutionary, past, remains, and, fossils, have, been, found, and, evolved, more, slowly, than, those, in, fly, species, since, 2018, a, new, version, of, the, honey, bee, genome, is, available, on, ncbi, amel, hav3, 1, bioproject, id, prjna471592, this, assembly, contains, full, chromosome, length, scaffolds, which, means, that, the, sequence, data, for, each, chromosome, is, contiguous, and, not, split, between, multiple, pieces, called, scaffolds, the, existence, of, a, highly, contiguous, reference, genome, for, a, species, enables, more, detailed, investigations, of, evolutionary, processes, that, affect, the, genome, as, well, as, more, accurate, estimations, of, for, example, differentiation, between, populations, and, diversity, within, populations, an, important, process, that, shapes, the, honey, bee, genome, is, meiotic, recombination, the, rate, of, which, is, strongly, elevated, in, honey, bees, and, other, social, insects, of, the, hymenoptera, order, compared, to, most, other, eukaryotic, species, except, fungi, and, protozoa, the, reason, for, elevated, recombination, rates, in, social, hymenoptera, is, not, fully, understood, but, one, theory, is, that, it, is, related, to, their, social, behaviour, the, increased, genetic, diversity, resulting, from, high, recombination, rates, could, make, the, workers, less, vulnerable, to, parasites, and, facilitate, their, specialisations, to, different, tasks, in, the, colony, western, honey, bee, populations, face, threats, to, their, survival, increasing, interests, into, other, pollinator, species, like, the, common, eastern, bumblebee, north, american, and, european, populations, were, severely, depleted, by, varroa, mite, infestations, during, the, early, 1990s, and, u, s, beekeepers, were, further, affected, by, colony, collapse, disorder, in, 2006, and, 2007, some, subspecies, of, apis, mellifera, show, naturally, varroa, sensitive, hygiene, for, example, apis, mellifera, lamarckii, and, apis, mellifera, carnica, improved, cultural, practices, and, chemical, treatments, against, varroa, mites, saved, most, commercial, operations, new, bee, breeds, are, beginning, to, reduce, beekeeper, dependence, on, acaricides, feral, bee, populations, were, greatly, reduced, during, this, period, they, are, slowly, recovering, primarily, in, mild, climates, due, to, natural, selection, for, varroa, resistance, and, repopulation, by, resistant, breeds, although, it, is, generally, believed, that, insecticides, have, also, depleted, bee, populations, particularly, when, used, in, excess, of, label, directions, as, bee, pests, and, diseases, including, american, foulbrood, and, tracheal, mites, are, becoming, resistant, to, medications, research, in, this, regard, has, not, been, conclusive, a, 2012, study, of, the, effect, of, neonicotinoid, based, insecticides, showed, no, effects, observed, in, field, studies, at, field, realistic, dosages, a, new, study, in, 2020, found, that, neonicotinoid, insecticides, affected, the, developmental, stability, of, honey, bees, particularly, haploid, males, were, more, susceptible, to, neonicotinoids, than, diploid, females, the, 2020, study, also, found, that, heterozygosity, may, play, a, key, role, in, buffering, insecticide, exposure, in, north, america, various, native, milkweed, species, may, be, found, with, dead, western, honey, bees, stuck, to, their, flowers, the, non, native, western, honey, bees, are, attracted, to, the, flowers, but, are, not, adapted, to, their, pollination, mechanisms, the, milkweed, pollinium, is, collected, when, the, tarsus, foot, of, an, insect, falls, into, one, of, the, flower, s, stigmatic, slits, as, it, obtains, nectar, from, the, flower, s, hood, if, the, insect, is, unable, to, remove, its, tarsus, from, the, stigmatic, slit, it, is, likely, to, die, due, to, predation, or, starvation, exhaustion, if, the, insect, is, able, to, escape, with, damaged, or, missing, tarsi, it, may, also, be, likely, to, die, from, its, injuries, western, honey, bees, which, escape, with, their, tarsi, intact, may, have, their, nectar, gathering, ability, obstructed, by, parts, of, the, pollinia, being, stuck, to, the, bee, s, proboscis, resulting, in, starvation, the, pollinia, may, also, stick, to, the, bee, s, tarsal, claws, causing, a, lack, of, climbing, ability, and, honey, gathering, which, may, result, in, expulsion, from, the, colony, leading, to, death, native, butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, bees, and, wasps, are, common, milkweed, visitors, which, are, often, able, to, escape, without, issue, though, some, species, of, megachile, halictus, astata, lucilia, trichius, pamphila, and, scepsis, have, been, found, dead, on, the, flowers, after, removing, over, 140, dead, bees, from, a, patch, of, a, sullivantii, entomologist, charles, robertson, quipped, it, seems, that, the, flowers, are, better, adapted, to, kill, hive, bees, than, to, produce, fruit, through, their, aid, insect, predators, of, western, honey, bees, include, the, asian, giant, hornet, and, other, wasps, robber, flies, dragonflies, such, as, the, green, darner, some, mantises, water, striders, and, the, european, beewolf, arachnid, predators, of, western, honey, bees, include, fishing, spiders, lynx, spiders, goldenrod, spiders, and, st, andrew, s, cross, spiders, reptile, and, amphibian, predators, of, western, honey, bees, include, the, black, girdled, lizard, anoles, and, other, lizards, and, various, anuran, amphibians, including, the, american, toad, the, american, bullfrog, and, the, wood, frog, specialist, bird, predators, of, western, honey, bees, include, the, bee, eaters, other, birds, that, may, take, western, honey, bees, include, grackles, hummingbirds, tyrant, flycatchers, and, the, summer, tanager, most, birds, that, eat, bees, do, so, opportunistically, however, summer, tanagers, will, sit, on, a, limb, and, catch, dozens, of, bees, from, the, hive, entrance, as, they, emerge, mammals, that, sometimes, take, western, honey, bees, include, giant, armadillos, opossums, raccoons, skunks, the, north, american, least, shrew, and, the, honey, badger, humoral, and, cellular, immune, mechanisms, of, western, honey, bees, are, similar, to, those, of, other, insects, trans, generational, immune, priming, tgip, is, an, approach, that, insects, use, to, pass, specific, immunity, from, one, generation, to, the, next, the, offspring, are, more, likely, to, overcome, pathogens, that, their, parents, have, encountered, tgip, resembles, adaptive, immune, responses, but, with, different, underlying, mechanisms, tgip, against, paenibacillus, larvae, which, causes, american, foulbrood, has, been, demonstrated, the, egg, yolk, protein, vitellogenin, vg, plays, an, important, role, in, tgip, in, honey, bees, as, it, participates, in, the, information, transmitted, between, queen, and, offspring, immune, elicitors, such, as, fragments, or, microbes, are, considered, pathogen, associated, molecular, patterns, pamps, vg, can, bind, and, deliver, pamps, to, offspring, and, thereafter, lead, to, the, induction, of, immunity, related, genes, in,

mandibles, to, remove, parasites, like, mites, and, dust, like, materials, from, their, bodies, is, referred, to, as, grooming, grooming, includes, self, grooming, auto, grooming, and, inter, grooming, allo, grooming, between, nest, mates, self, grooming, involves, pulling, on, antennae, rubbing, the, head, with, the, forelegs, and, rubbing, the, thorax, or, abdomen, with, the, middle, or, hind, legs, inter, grooming, is, a, colony, level, behavior, and, individuals, within, the, colony, gain, benefits, from, their, nest, mates, in, this, manner, by, exhibiting, a, grooming, dance,

ascosphaera, apis, which, causes, chalkbrood, diseases, and, the, p, larvae, freeze, killed, brood, assay, is, a, simple, strategies, to, assess, the, hygienic, behavior, of, honey, bee, colonies, some, entomologists, have, observed, that, non, native, feral, western, honey, bees, can, have, negative, impacts, within, their, non, native, environment, imported, bees, may, displace, native, bees, and, may, also, promote, reproduction, of, invasive, plants, ignored, by, native, pollinators, honey, bees, are, not, native, to, the, americas, arriving, with, colonists, in, north, america, in, the, 18th, century, thomas, jefferson, mentioned, this, in, his, notes, on, the, state, of, virginia, the, honey, bee, is, not, a, native, of, our, continent, marcgrave, indeed, mentions, a, species, of, honey, bee, in, brasil, but, this, has, no, sting, and, is, therefore, different, from, the, one, we, have, which, resembles, perfectly, that, of, europe, the, indians, concur, with, us, in, the, tradition, that, it, was, brought, from, europe, but, when, and, by, whom, we, know, not, the, bees, have, generally, extended, themselves, into, the, country, a, little, in, advance, of, the, white, settlers, the, indians, therefore, call, them, the, white, man, s, fly, and, consider, their, approach, as, indicating, the, approach, of, the, settlements, of, the, whites, sources, may, claim, that, honey, bees, apis, mellifera, have, become, an, invasive, species, in, the, united, states, outcompeting, native, pollinators, for, food, however, while, the, usda, lists, africanized, honeybees, apis, mellifera, scutellata, as, an, invasive, species, it, does, not, classify, western, honey, bees, as, invasive, with, an, increased, number, of, honey, bees, in, a, specific, area, due, to, beekeeping, domesticated, bees, and, native, wild, bees, often, have, to, compete, for, the, limited, habitat, and, food, sources, available, western, honey, bees, may, become, defensive, in, response, to, the, seasonal, arrival, of, competition, from, other, colonies, particularly, africanized, bees, which, may, be, on, the, offence, and, defence, year, round, due, to, their, tropical, origin, in, the, united, kingdom, honey, bees, are, known, to, compete, with, native, bumblebees, such, as, bombus, hortorum, because, they, forage, at, the, same, sites, to, resolve, the, issue, and, maximize, both, their, total, consumption, during, foraging, bumblebees, forage, early, in, the, morning, while, honey, bees, forage, during, the, afternoon, a, 2017, systematic, review, looked, at, the, impacts, of, managed, bees, on, wild, bee, populations, in, addition, to, honey, bees, this, includes, bumble, bees, and, some, solitary, bees, the, analysis, looked, at, resource, competition, and, changes, in, plant, communities, it, also, discussed, how, managed, bees, may, interact, with, wild, bees, by, transmitting, pathogens, it, found, an, equal, number, of, studies, reporting, both, positive, and, negative, effects, on, plant, communities, studies, examining, resource, competition, had, significant, variability, in, their, results, while, most, studies, on, pathogen, transmission, pointed, to, potentially, detrimental, impacts, the, researchers, noted, that, most, studies, documented, the, possibility, of, certain, interactions, without, actually, measuring, the, direct, effects, the, very, generalized, nature, of, the, honey, bee, s, nectar, gathering, activities, potentially, visiting, dozens, of, different, species, in, a, single, day, means, that, a, flower, visited, by, a, honey, bee, will, often, get, very, little, pollen, from, its, species, this, diminished, pollination, can, reduce, the, plant, s, ability, to, produce, seeds, especially, when, the, honey, bees, are, squeezing, out, the, native, pollinators, for, a, species, a, problem, occurring, all, over, the, united, states, because, of, honey, bees, and, other, invasive, species, most, flowering, plants, depend, on, specialized, pollinators, to, efficiently, fertilize, them, cucurbits, for, example, are, pollinated, by, squash, bees, that, specifically, visit, the, early, blooming, male, flowers, before, sunrise, when, honey, bees, are, inactive, and, then, return, to, pollinate, the, female, flowers, later, in, the, day, such, symbiotic, relationships, also, mean, that, the, specialized, pollinator, will, be, covered, mainly, in, its, host, s, specific, pollen, unlike, native, bees, they, do, not, properly, extract, or, transfer, pollen, from, plants, with, pore, anthers, anthers, which, only, release, pollen, through, tiny, apical, pores, this, requires, buzz, pollination, a, behavior, rarely, exhibited, by, honey, bees, honey, bees, reduce, fruiting, in, melastoma, affine, a, plant, with, pore, anthers, by, robbing, its, stigmas, of, previously, deposited, pollen, apart, from, apis, mellifera, there, are, six, other, species, in, the, genus, apis, these, are, apis, andreniformis, apis, cerana, apis, dorsata, apis, florea, apis, koschevnikovi, and, apis, nigrocincta, these, species, all, originated, in, southern, and, southeastern, asia, only, apis, mellifera, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, europe, asia, and, africa
