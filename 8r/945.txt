the, bromeliaceae, the, bromeliads, are, a, family, of, monocot, flowering, plants, of, about, 80, genera, and, 3700, known, species, native, mainly, to, the, tropical, americas, with, several, species, found, in, the, american, subtropics, and, one, in, tropical, west, africa, pitcairnia, feliciana, it, is, among, the, basal, families, within, the, poales, and, is, the, only, family, within, the, order, that, has, septal, nectaries, and, inferior, ovaries, these, inferior, ovaries, characterize, the, bromelioideae, a, subfamily, of, the, bromeliaceae, the, family, includes, both, epiphytes, such, as, spanish, moss, tillandsia, usneoides, and, terrestrial, species, such, as, the, pineapple, ananas, comosus, many, bromeliads, are, able, to, store, water, in, a, structure, formed, by, their, tightly, overlapping, leaf, bases, however, the, family, is, diverse, enough, to, include, the, tank, bromeliads, grey, leaved, epiphyte, tillandsia, species, that, gather, water, only, from, leaf, structures, called, trichomes, and, many, desert, dwelling, succulents, the, largest, bromeliad, is, puya, raimondii, which, reaches, 3, 4, metres, 9, 8, 13, 1, ft, tall, in, vegetative, growth, with, a, flower, spike, 9, 10, metres, 30, 33, ft, tall, and, the, smallest, is, spanish, moss, bromeliads, are, mostly, herbaceous, perennials, although, a, few, have, a, more, tree, like, habit, many, are, more, or, less, succulent, or, have, other, adaptations, to, resist, drought, they, may, be, terrestrial, or, epiphytic, rarely, climbing, e, g, pitcairnia, species, some, species, of, tillandsia, e, g, spanish, moss, tillandsia, usneoides, are, aerophytes, which, have, very, reduced, root, systems, and, absorb, water, directly, from, the, air, many, terrestrial, and, epiphytic, bromeliads, have, their, leaves, in, the, form, of, vase, shaped, rosettes, which, accumulate, water, individual, leaves, are, not, divided, and, have, parallel, veins, without, cross, connections, the, epidermis, of, the, leaf, contains, silica, bromeliad, flowers, are, aggregated, into, inflorescences, of, various, forms, the, flowers, have, bracts, often, brightly, coloured, and, distinct, calyces, of, three, sepals, and, corollas, of, three, petals, the, flowers, have, nectaries, they, are, pollinated, by, insects, birds, often, hummingbirds, or, bats, or, more, rarely, in, navia, they, are, wind, pollinated, fruits, are, variable, typically, taking, the, form, of, a, capsule, or, a, berry, bromeliads, are, able, to, live, in, an, array, of, environmental, conditions, due, to, their, many, adaptations, trichomes, in, the, form, of, scales, or, hairs, allow, bromeliads, to, capture, water, in, cloud, forests, and, help, to, reflect, sunlight, in, desert, environments, bromeliads, with, leaf, vases, can, capture, water, and, nutrients, in, the, absence, of, a, well, developed, root, system, many, bromeliads, also, use, crassulacean, acid, metabolism, cam, photosynthesis, to, create, sugars, this, adaptation, allows, bromeliads, in, hot, or, dry, climates, to, open, their, stomata, at, night, rather, than, during, the, day, which, reduces, water, loss, both, cam, and, epiphytism, have, evolved, multiple, times, within, the, family, with, some, taxa, reverting, to, c3, photosynthesis, as, they, radiated, into, less, arid, climates, bromeliads, are, among, the, more, recent, plant, groups, to, have, emerged, they, are, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, tepuis, of, the, guiana, shield, approximately, 100, million, years, ago, the, greatest, number, of, extant, basal, species, are, found, in, the, andean, highlands, of, south, america, however, the, family, did, not, diverge, into, its, extant, subfamilies, until, 19, million, years, ago, the, long, period, between, the, origin, and, diversification, of, bromeliads, during, which, no, extant, species, evolved, suggests, that, there, was, much, speciation, and, extinction, during, that, time, which, would, explain, the, genetic, distance, of, the, bromeliaceae, from, other, families, within, the, poales, based, on, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, the, family, is, divided, into, eight, subfamilies, the, relationship, among, them, is, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, brocchinioideae, lindmanioideae, tillandsioideae, hechtioideae, navioideae, pitcairnioideae, puyoideae, bromelioideae, the, most, basal, genus, brocchinia, subfamily, brocchinioideae, is, endemic, to, the, guiana, shield, and, is, placed, as, the, sister, group, to, the, remaining, genera, in, the, family, the, subfamilies, lindmanioideae, and, navioideae, are, endemic, to, the, guiana, shield, as, well, the, west, african, species, pitcairnia, feliciana, is, the, only, bromeliad, not, endemic, to, the, americas, and, is, thought, to, have, reached, africa, via, long, distance, dispersal, about, 12, million, years, ago, the, first, groups, to, leave, the, guiana, shield, were, the, subfamily, tillandsioideae, which, spread, gradually, into, northern, south, america, and, the, genus, hechtia, hechtioideae, which, spread, to, central, america, via, long, distance, dispersal, both, of, these, movements, occurred, approximately, 15, 4, million, years, ago, when, it, reached, the, andes, mountains, the, speciation, of, tillandsioideae, occurred, quite, rapidly, largely, due, to, the, andean, uplift, which, was, also, occurring, rapidly, from, 14, 2, to, 8, 7, million, years, ago, the, uplift, greatly, altered, the, region, s, geological, and, climatic, conditions, creating, a, new, mountainous, environment, for, the, epiphytic, tillandsioids, to, colonize, these, new, conditions, directly, drove, the, speciation, of, the, tillandsioideae, and, also, drove, the, speciation, of, their, animal, pollinators, such, as, hummingbirds, around, 5, 5, million, years, ago, a, clade, of, epiphytic, bromelioids, arose, in, serra, do, mar, a, lush, mountainous, region, on, the, coast, of, southeastern, brazil, this, is, thought, to, have, been, caused, not, only, by, the, uplift, of, serra, do, mar, itself, at, that, time, but, also, because, of, the, continued, uplift, of, the, distant, andes, mountains, which, impacted, the, circulation, of, air, and, created, a, cooler, wetter, climate, in, serra, do, mar, these, epiphytes, thrived, in, this, humid, environment, since, their, trichomes, rely, on, water, in, the, air, rather, than, from, the, ground, like, terrestrial, plants, many, epiphytic, bromeliads, with, the, tank, habit, also, speciated, here, even, before, this, a, few, other, bromelioids, had, already, dispersed, to, the, brazilian, shield, while, the, climate, was, still, arid, likely, through, a, gradual, process, of, short, distance, dispersal, these, make, up, the, terrestrial, members, of, the, bromelioideae, which, have, highly, xeromorphic, characters, the, family, bromeliaceae, is, currently, placed, in, the, order, poales, the, family, bromeliaceae, is, organized, into, eight, subfamilies, bromeliaceae, were, originally, split, into, three, subfamilies, based, on, morphological, seed, characters, bromelioideae, seeds, in, baccate, fruits, tillandsioideae, plumose, seeds, and, pitcairnioideae, seeds, with, wing, like, appendages, however, molecular, evidence, has, revealed, that, while, bromelioideae, and, tillandsioideae, are, monophyletic, pitcairnioideae, as, traditionally, defined, is, paraphyletic, and, should, be, split, into, six, subfamilies, brocchinioideae, lindmanioideae, hechtioideae, navioideae, pitcairnioideae, and, puyoideae, brocchinioideae, is, defined, as, the, most, basal, branch, of, bromeliaceae, based, on, both, morphological, and, molecular, evidence, namely, genes, in, chloroplast, dna, lindmanioideae, is, the, next, most, basal, branch, distinguished, from, the, other, subfamilies, by, convolute, sepals, and, chloroplast, dna, hechtioideae, is, also, defined, based, on, analyses, of, chloroplast, dna, similar, morphological, adaptations, to, arid, environments, also, found, in, other, groups, namely, the, genus, puya, are, attributed, to, convergent, evolution, navioideae, is, split, from, pitcairnioideae, based, on, its, cochlear, sepals, and, chloroplast, dna, puyoideae, has, been, re, classified, multiple, times, and, its, monophyly, remains, controversial, according, to, analyses, of, chloroplast, dna, as, of, december, 2022, plants, of, the, world, online, powo, accepted, 72, genera, as, listed, below, a, few, more, genera, were, accepted, by, the, encyclopaedia, of, bromeliads, including, josemania, and, mezobromelia, which, powo, sinks, into, cipuropsis, intergeneric, hybrid, genera, accepted, by, plants, of, the, world, online, include, plants, in, the, bromeliaceae, are, widely, represented, in, their, natural, climates, across, the, americas, one, species, pitcairnia, feliciana, can, be, found, in, africa, they, can, be, found, at, altitudes, from, sea, level, to, 4, 200, meters, from, rainforests, to, deserts, 1, 814, species, are, epiphytes, some, are, lithophytes, and, some, are, terrestrial, accordingly, these, plants, can, be, found, in, the, andean, highlands, from, northern, chile, to, colombia, in, the, sechura, desert, of, coastal, peru, in, the, cloud, forests, of, central, and, south, america, in, southern, united, states, from, southern, virginia, to, florida, to, texas, and, in, far, southern, arizona, bromeliads, often, serve, as, phytotelmata, accumulating, water, between, their, leaves, one, study, found, 175, 000, bromeliads, per, hectare, 2, 5, acres, in, one, forest, that, many, bromeliads, can, sequester, 50, 000, liters, more, than, 13, 000, gallons, of, water, the, aquatic, habitat, created, as, a, result, is, host, to, a, diverse, array, of, invertebrates, especially, aquatic, insect, larvae, including, those, of, mosquitos, these, bromeliad, invertebrates, benefit, their, hosts, by, increasing, nitrogen, uptake, into, the, plant, a, study, of, 209, plants, from, the, yasun, scientific, reserve, in, ecuador, identified, 11, 219, animals, representing, more, than, 350, distinct, species, many, of, which, are, found, only, on, bromeliads, examples, include, some, species, of, ostracods, small, salamanders, about, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, in, length, and, tree, frogs, jamaican, bromeliads, are, home, to, metopaulias, depressus, a, reddish, brown, crab, 2, cm, 0, 8, in, across, which, has, evolved, social, behavior, to, protect, its, young, from, predation, by, diceratobasis, macrogaster, a, species, of, damselfly, whose, larvae, live, in, bromeliads, some, bromeliads, even, form, homes, for, other, species, of, bromeliads, trees, or, branches, that, have, a, higher, incidence, of, sunlight, tend, to, have, more, bromeliads, in, contrast, the, sectors, facing, west, receive, less, sunlight, and, therefore, fewer, bromeliads, in, addition, thicker, trees, have, more, bromeliads, possibly, because, they, are, older, and, have, greater, structural, complexity, humans, have, been, using, bromeliads, for, thousands, of, years, the, incas, aztecs, maya, and, others, used, them, for, food, protection, fiber, and, ceremony, just, as, they, are, still, used, today, european, interest, began, when, spanish, conquistadors, returned, with, pineapple, which, became, so, popular, as, an, exotic, food, that, the, image, of, the, pineapple, was, adapted, into, european, art, and, sculpture, in, 1776, the, species, guzmania, lingulata, was, introduced, to, europe, causing, a, sensation, among, gardeners, unfamiliar, with, such, a, plant, in, 1828, aechmea, fasciata, was, brought, to, europe, followed, by, vriesea, splendens, in, 1840, these, transplants, were, so, successful, they, are, still, among, the, most, widely, grown, bromeliad, varieties, in, the, 19th, century, breeders, in, belgium, france, and, the, netherlands, started, hybridizing, plants, for, wholesale, trade, many, exotic, varieties, were, produced, until, world, war, i, which, halted, breeding, programs, and, led, to, the, loss, of, some, species, the, plants, experienced, a, resurgence, of, popularity, after, world, war, ii, since, then, dutch, belgian, and, north, american, nurseries, have, greatly, expanded, bromeliad, production, only, one, bromeliad, the, pineapple, ananas, comosus, is, a, commercially, important, food, crop, bromelain, a, common, ingredient, in, meat, tenderizer, is, extracted, from, pineapple, stems, many, other, bromeliads, are, popular, ornamental, plants, grown, as, both, garden, and, houseplants, bromeliads, are, important, food, plants, for, many, peoples, for, example, the, pima, of, mexico, occasionally, consume, flowers, of, tillandsia, erubescens, and, t, recurvata, due, to, their, high, sugar, content, in, argentina, and, bolivia, the, shoot, apices, of, t, rubella, and, t, maxima, are, consumed, in, venezuela, indigenous, coastal, tribes, eat, a, sour, tasting, but, sweet, smelling, berry, known, as, maya, of, bromelia, chrysantha, as, a, fruit, or, in, fermented, beverages, in, chile, the, sweet, fruit, of, greigia, sphacelata, known, as, chupones, is, consumed, raw, douard, andr, was, a, french, collector, explorer, whose, many, discoveries, of, bromeliads, in, the, cordilleras, of, south, america, would, be, influential, on, horticulturists, to, follow, he, served, as, a, source, of, inspiration, to, 20th, century, collectors, in, particular, mulford, b, foster, and, lyman, smith, of, the, united, states, and, werner, rauh, of, germany, and, michelle, jenkins, of, australia
