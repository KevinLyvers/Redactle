tinamous, t, n, m, u, z, are, members, of, the, order, tinamiformes, t, n, m, f, r, m, i, z, and, family, tinamidae, t, n, m, d, i, divided, into, two, distinct, subfamilies, containing, 46, species, found, in, mexico, central, america, and, south, america, the, word, tinamou, comes, from, the, galibi, term, for, these, birds, tinamu, tinamous, are, the, only, living, group, of, palaeognaths, able, to, fly, and, were, traditionally, regarded, as, the, sister, group, of, the, flightless, ratites, but, recent, work, places, them, well, within, the, ratite, radiation, as, most, closely, related, to, the, extinct, moa, of, new, zealand, implying, flightlessness, emerged, among, ratites, multiple, times, tinamous, first, appear, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, miocene, epoch, they, are, generally, sedentary, ground, dwelling, and, though, not, flightless, when, possible, avoid, flight, in, favour, of, hiding, or, running, away, from, danger, they, are, found, in, a, variety, of, habitats, ranging, from, semi, arid, alpine, grasslands, to, tropical, rainforests, the, two, subfamilies, are, broadly, divided, by, habitat, with, the, nothurinae, referred, to, as, steppe, or, open, country, tinamous, and, the, tinaminae, known, as, forest, tinamous, although, some, species, are, quite, common, tinamous, are, shy, and, secretive, birds, they, are, active, during, the, day, retiring, to, roosts, at, night, they, generally, have, cryptic, plumage, with, males, and, females, similar, in, appearance, though, the, females, are, usually, larger, they, are, opportunistic, and, omnivorous, feeders, consuming, a, wide, variety, of, plant, and, animal, food, from, fruits, and, seeds, to, worms, insects, and, small, vertebrates, they, will, dust, bathe, as, well, as, wash, themselves, by, standing, in, heavy, rain, they, are, heard, more, often, than, seen, communicating, with, each, other, by, a, variety, of, frequently, given, characteristic, calls, especially, during, the, breeding, season, with, occasional, exceptions, a, male, tinamou, maintains, a, territory, and, a, nesting, site, during, the, breeding, season, which, a, succession, of, females, will, visit, laying, their, eggs, in, the, same, nest, females, will, wander, through, several, territories, mating, with, and, laying, eggs, in, the, nests, of, the, resident, males, nests, are, always, on, the, ground, concealed, in, vegetation, or, among, rocks, eggs, are, relatively, large, and, glossy, often, brightly, colored, when, laid, and, are, incubated, by, the, males, for, a, period, of, 2, 3, weeks, the, chicks, can, run, soon, after, hatching, and, are, largely, self, sufficient, at, three, weeks, old, tinamous, and, their, eggs, have, many, natural, predators, from, falcons, and, vampire, bats, to, jaguars, they, have, also, been, extensively, hunted, by, humans, and, sometimes, persecuted, as, agricultural, pests, however, the, main, threat, to, their, populations, is, from, habitat, destruction, through, land, clearing, and, agricultural, development, seven, species, are, listed, as, vulnerable, and, another, seven, as, near, threatened, they, feature, in, the, mythology, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, their, range, often, translocated, and, easily, bred, in, captivity, they, have, never, been, successfully, domesticated, the, tinamou, family, consists, of, 46, extant, species, in, nine, genera, the, two, subfamilies, are, the, nothurinae, also, known, as, the, rhyncotinae, the, steppe, tinamous, and, the, tinaminae, the, forest, tinamous, tinamidae, was, defined, as, by, gauthier, and, de, queiroz, 2001, tinamidae, refers, to, the, crown, clade, stemming, from, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, tetrao, major, gmelin, 1789, and, all, extant, birds, sharing, a, more, recent, ancestor, with, that, species, than, with, struthio, camelus, linnaeus, 1758, and, vultur, gryphus, linnaeus, 1758, their, similarity, to, other, ground, dwelling, birds, such, as, partridges, and, megapodes, is, a, result, of, convergence, and, symplesiomorphy, rather, than, shared, evolutionary, innovations, of, gondwanan, origin, tinamous, are, allied, to, the, flightless, ratites, together, comprising, the, palaeognathae, old, jaws, while, all, other, living, birds, are, members, of, neognathae, new, jaws, unlike, other, palaeognaths, tinamous, do, have, a, keeled, sternum, but, like, the, other, palaeognaths, they, have, a, distinctive, palate, it, was, formerly, believed, that, the, tinamiformes, separated, from, the, ratites, early, on, due, to, their, retention, of, a, keeled, sternum, the, tinamous, possession, of, powder, down, feathers, and, preen, glands, which, the, other, ratites, lack, was, another, source, of, confusion, in, evaluating, their, taxonomy, the, tinamou, family, has, been, shown, to, be, monophyletic, phylogenomic, studies, have, placed, it, as, the, sister, group, to, extant, australasian, and, oceanian, ratites, i, e, the, cassowaries, emus, and, kiwis, thus, putting, it, well, within, the, ratite, phylogenetic, tree, with, the, south, american, rheas, and, african, ostriches, as, successive, outgroups, research, published, starting, in, 2010, has, found, that, tinamous, are, closest, to, the, extinct, moa, of, new, zealand, moa, are, more, distantly, related, to, the, geographically, proximate, kiwis, emus, and, cassowaries, than, had, been, previously, supposed, these, findings, imply, that, flightlessness, evolved, independently, multiple, times, in, ratite, evolution, flight, may, have, been, maintained, in, the, tinamou, family, due, to, the, rhea, colonizing, south, america, before, ancestral, tinamous, arrived, the, ecological, niche, for, large, flightless, herbivores, was, thus, already, occupied, forcing, tinamous, to, retain, smaller, bodied, omnivorous, and, volant, lifestyles, flight, capable, lithornithids, from, the, paleocene, and, eocene, epochs, appear, to, have, been, structurally, the, most, similar, precursors, to, the, tinamous, and, may, have, been, ancestral, to, them, as, well, as, to, the, ratites, though, their, precise, relationships, are, unclear, the, earliest, unequivocally, tinamiforme, fossil, material, dates, from, the, miocene, but, flightless, ratite, like, taxa, from, the, paleocene, may, belong, to, this, group, several, tinamou, fossils, have, been, found, in, the, 16, 17, mya, early, middle, miocene, santa, cruz, formation, and, the, contemporary, or, slightly, older, pinturas, formation, in, santa, cruz, province, of, argentinian, patagonia, including, a, tinaminid, crypturellus, reai, associated, fossils, indicate, that, the, local, palaeoenvironment, at, the, beginning, of, this, period, was, characterised, by, a, humid, subtropical, climate, with, forest, vegetation, becoming, drier, and, more, open, with, time, some, of, the, tinamou, fossil, material, appears, to, be, intermediate, between, the, two, subfamilies, suggesting, that, the, period, coincides, with, the, origins, of, the, radiation, of, the, nothurinae, into, the, expanding, open, country, habitats, nothurine, fossils, referrable, to, eudromia, and, nothura, have, been, found, in, the, late, miocene, cerro, azul, formation, from, the, pampean, region, of, central, southern, argentina, tinamous, described, from, pliocene, material, include, eudromia, olsoni, tambussi, tonni, 1985, nothura, parvulus, rovereto, 1914, and, nothura, padulosa, mercerat, 1897, the, pliocene, fossil, genera, cayetornis, brodkorb, and, tinamisornis, rovereto, have, been, synonymized, with, nothura, and, eudromia, respectively, fossils, having, affinities, with, several, extant, genera, have, been, found, in, pleistocene, deposits, cladogram, of, tinamou, genera, based, on, a, study, by, lukas, musher, and, collaborators, published, in, 2024, nothocercus, 3, species, tinamus, 5, species, crypturellus,

absent, the, back, of, the, tarsus, is, covered, with, scales, the, color, of, which, may, aid, in, identification, tinamous, have, a, pneumaticized, skeleton, with, a, sternal, keel, 16, 18, cervical, vertebrae, and, fused, thoracic, vertebrae, they, have, poor, circulation, evidenced, by, a, greenish, tint, to, the, skin, they, also, have, relatively, the, smallest, hearts, and, lungs, of, all, birds, comprising, only, 1, 6, 3, 1, of, their, body, weight, whereas, the, equivalent, in, a, domestic, chicken, is, 12, despite, their, poor, flying, ability, the, percentage, of, their, body, mass, that, is, muscle, is, 28, 6, 40, which, is, similar, to, that, of, hummingbirds, the, preen, gland, is, small, and, tufted, the, male, has, a, corkscrew, shaped, penis, similar, to, those, of, the, other, ratites, and, to, the, hemipenis, of, some, reptiles, the, female, has, a, small, phallic, organ, in, the, cloaca, which, becomes, larger, during, the, breeding, season, the, plumage, of, the, family, is, cryptic, as, is, usual, with, ground, birds, with, typical, colors, ranging, through, dark, brown, rufous, buff, yellow, and, grey, plumage, does, not, usually, differ, between, sexes, but, in, a, few, species, females, are, brighter, the, forest, dwellers, tend, to, be, darker, and, more, uniform, whereas, the, steppe, species, are, paler, with, more, barring, speckling, or, streaking, tinamous, have, well, developed, powder, down, feathers, these, grow, continuously, and, disintegrate, at, the, tips, into, a, powder, that, is, spread, through, the, rest, of, the, feathers, by, preening, this, gives, the, plumage, a, glossy, appearance, as, well, as, waterproofing, it, their, tails, are, short, sometimes, hidden, behind, the, coverts, and, possibly, indicative, of, an, ability, to, sacrifice, feathers, to, a, predator, in, order, to, escape, when, grasped, some, tinamous, have, crests, members, of, eudromia, have, the, most, developed, crests, and, when, excited, will, direct, them, forward, tinamous, are, rarely, seen, but, often, heard, within, their, range, and, have, a, wide, variety, of, calls, they, are, among, the, most, characteristic, bird, vocalizations, of, south, america, and, central, america, often, resembling, sounds, made, by, a, flute, or, a, whistle, some, calls, are, uniform, and, monotone, while, others, have, multiple, phrases, they, vary, in, intensity, and, can, often, be, heard, from, afar, trying, to, locate, a, bird, by, its, call, is, not, easy, plains, dwelling, tinamous, have, higher, pitched, more, delicate, voices, they, can, also, be, less, melodic, sometimes, resembling, the, chirps, of, crickets, forest, species, tend, to, have, deep, loud, calls, suitable, for, penetrating, the, vegetation, the, male, highland, tinamou, can, be, heard, several, kilometres, distant, through, dense, forest, when, calling, a, tinamou, extends, its, neck, vertically, tilts, its, head, at, an, angle, and, opens, its, bill, wide, a, bird, when, flushed, will, utter, a, sharp, trill, identification, of, tinamous, is, not, an, easy, task, utilizing, their, calls, as, a, tool, is, integral, each, species, has, its, own, unique, call, or, calls, the, solitary, tinamou, has, 11, different, vocalizations, in, most, species, both, sexes, call, some, have, different, calls, for, males, and, females, females, tend, to, have, deeper, voices, some, species, in, particular, members, of, crypturellus, have, regional, dialects, male, slaty, breasted, tinamous, have, calls, unique, enough, to, be, individually, recognized, by, humans, calls, are, typically, heard, more, frequently, during, the, breeding, season, however, the, time, of, day, can, differ, amongst, species, as, some, are, more, vocal, in, the, morning, others, in, the, evening, and, some, are, more, vocal, during, the, heat, of, midday, some, will, call, at, night, from, their, roosts, frequency, can, vary, between, species, and, between, individuals, one, male, brushland, tinamou, called, every, few, minutes, from, dawn, until, dusk, over, 500, calls, daily, some, in, particular, crypturellus, species, use, regular, call, sites, only, a, few, possess, an, alarm, call, tinamous, are, exclusively, neotropical, and, all, 47, species, live, in, south, america, mexico, and, central, america, the, range, of, the, northernmost, species, extends, to, mexico, but, not, much, further, north, than, the, tropic, of, cancer, chilean, tinamous, have, been, introduced, to, easter, island, the, greatest, concentration, of, species, is, in, the, tropics, and, in, particular, the, amazon, basin, in, the, north, they, tend, to, be, forest, or, woodland, birds, while, in, the, south, they, prefer, open, habitats, tinamous, form, the, dominant, group, of, terrestrial, birds, in, south, america, where, they, largely, replace, the, galliformes, ecologically, with, no, other, bird, family, there, having, comparable, diversity, distribution, or, suite, of, habitat, adaptations, rheas, are, only, found, in, open, country, curassows, and, guans, are, generally, limited, to, forests, and, the, pheasant, family, is, only, represented, by, a, few, species, in, the, north, of, the, region, they, occur, in, a, wide, range, of, habitats, members, of, the, genera, tinamus, nothocercus, and, crypturellus, live, in, dense, forests, with, nothocercus, preferring, high, altitude, and, members, of, most, other, genera, in, grassland, puna, montane, forest, and, savanna, tinamotis, and, nothoprocta, prefer, high, altitude, habitats, up, to, 5, 000, m, 16, 000, ft, whereas, the, other, steppe, tinamous, have, a, wide, altitude, range, tinamous, inhabit, most, parts, of, south, and, central, america, as, well, as, the, tropical, regions, of, mexico, with, the, exception, of, aquatic, snow, covered, and, true, desert, habitats, and, the, southernmost, tip, of, patagonia, behavioral, and, ecological, separation, of, tinamou, species, is, evident, where, their, ranges, overlap, through, the, utilization, of, different, food, sources, and, occupation, of, limited, micro, habitats, these, micro, habitats, are, not, always, easy, to, identify, and, are, highly, vulnerable, to, environmental, changes, some, species, such, as, the, red, winged, tinamou, utilize, multiple, habitats, such, as, the, open, savannas, of, amazonia, and, the, dry, valleys, of, the, andes, similarly, brown, tinamous, occur, in, both, the, amazon, basin, and, the, humid, montane, forests, on, the, andean, slope, panama, provides, examples, of, ecological, separation, the, highland, tinamou, occupies, the, highlands, throughout, the, country, the, great, tinamou, prefers, the, rainforests, on, the, slopes, the, choco, tinamou, also, likes, the, rainforest, but, is, limited, to, the, south, east, of, the, country, finally, the, little, tinamou, is, found, in, dense, secondary, forest, on, either, the, pacific, or, atlantic, slope, above, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, size, difference, allows, the, red, winged, tinamou, and, the, spotted, nothura, to, coexist, as, they, both, occupy, the, same, habitat, of, brazil, the, tropical, savanna, the, former, prefers, long, grass, pastures, while, the, latter, prefers, short, grass, further, examples, of, such, diversity, are, found, in, the, andes, where, a, small, subspecies, of, darwin, s, nothura, nothura, darwinii, boliviana, occurs, in, grassland, at, about, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, above, sea, level, here, also, are, the, red, winged, tinamou, which, prefers, open, ground, with, some, scrub, and, the, andean, tinamou, which, prefers, dense, vegetation, beside, streams, their, habitat, extends, upslope, through, the, polylepis, woodlands, into, puna, grassland, in, the, puna, is, another, subspecies, of, darwin, s, nothura, nothura, darwinii, agassizii, which, prefers, tussock, grassland, also, in, the, puna, is, the, ornate, tinamou, which, frequents, the, rocky, slopes, and, cliffs, of, tola, heath, higher, in, the, puna, is, the, puna, tinamou, living, just, below, the, snowline, at, 5, 300, m, 17, 400, ft, as, well, as, in, the, semi, deserts, of, the, southern, altiplano, tinamous, are, largely, sedentary, birds, forest, dwelling, tinamous, will, move, short, distances, if, climatic, conditions, such, as, intense, rain, flooding, or, drought, force, them, to, most, amazonian, species, will, move, between, the, varzea, forests, and, dry, land, depending, on, water, levels, the, puna, tinamou, occupies, high, ridges, in, the, andes, but, in, bad, weather, will, move, down, to, the, valley, floors, forest, species, such, as, the, slaty, breasted, tinamou, maintain, large, home, ranges, through, which, they, move, in, apparently, random, patterns, the, male, brushland, tinamou, maintains, a, home, territory, of, 20, ha, 49, acres, but, will, occasionally, wander, outside, it, into, those, of, his, neighbors, females, will, wander, throughout, multiple, males, territories, the, ornate, tinamou, lives, mainly, upslope, in, hilly, puna, grassland, but, will, move, each, morning, to, the, bottom, of, the, slopes, to, feed, and, drink, granivorous, species, will, move, daily, into, grain, fields, with, some, such, as, darwin, s, nothura, remaining, in, the, fields, until, there, is, no, food, left, open, country, and, southern, species, maintain, territories, only, during, the, breeding, season, and, at, other, times, seem, to, wander, at, random, tinamous, form, one, of, the, most, terrestrial, groups, of, flying, birds, spending, virtually, all, of, their, time, on, the, ground, they, walk, silently, pausing, frequently, in, mid, stride, when, a, potential, threat, is, detected, a, tinamou, will, typically, freeze, in, one, of, two, positions, either, crouched, or, with, its, neck, extended, upwards, as, far, as, possible, they, will, avoid, resorting, to, flight, by, stealthy, walking, or, running, away, from, danger, as, well, as, by, concealment, in, dense, vegetation, they, may, then, pause, to, observe, the, cause, of, their, alarm, from, cover, they, also, hide, in, burrows, their, cryptic, behavior, has, allowed, them, to, survive, or, even, thrive, in, areas, where, guans, have, been, extirpated, unlike, the, related, ratites, tinamous, can, fly, though, poorly, and, reluctantly, preferring, to, walk, or, run, when, forced, to, take, to, the, air, they, do, so, only, for, short, distances, at, high, speed, their, small, wings, give, them, a, high, wing, loading, they, take, off, with, rapid, and, noisy, wing, beats, until, they, have, gained, sufficient, altitude, then, glide, while, slipping, sideways, with, an, occasional, further, burst, of, flapping, due, to, their, near, lack, of, a, tail, to, serve, as, rudder, or, counterweight, tinamous, are, notoriously, poor, at, steering, they, regularly, crash, into, objects, on, attempting, to, take, off, sometimes, with, fatal, consequences, they, rarely, fly, more, than, 150, m, 490, ft, and, typically, do, so, downslope, where, the, terrain, allows, they, land, in, an, upright, position, with, upstretched, neck, some, species, will, land, running, the, brushland, tinamou, will, perform, a, sharp, 90, turn, immediately, before, touching, down, although, tinamous, are, diurnal, many, species, become, less, active, in, the, middle, of, the, day, they, rest, or, feed, during, this, period, while, during, the, night, they, will, cease, all, activity, they, are, wary, of, the, dark, they, roost, at, night, and, have, been, known, to, roost, during, solar, eclipses, roosting, of, the, larger, forest, species, such, as, those, in, tinamus, occurs, in, trees, they, prefer, horizontal, branches, approximately, 2, 5, m, 6, 6, 16, 4, ft, off, the, ground, choosing, sites, with, good, views, and, clear, exits, in, order, to, minimize, the, effort, involved, in, ascending, to, their, roosts, in, hilly, terrain, they, will, access, them, from, uphill, and, when, threatened, will, fly, downhill, to, gain, more, distance, from, the, threat, tinamous, prefer, thick, branches, on, which, to, roost, as, they, do, not, clutch, the, branch, with, their, toes, but, rest, on, it, with, folded, legs, they, will, reuse, the, same, locations, and, avoid, defecating, nearby, to, avoid, advertising, the, roost, site, to, predators, the, smaller, forest, species, along, with, the, steppe, tinamous, will, roost, on, the, ground, sometimes, in, the, shelter, of, a, bush, they, will, also, use, the, same, location, repeatedly, known, examples, are, the, elegant, crested, and, ornate, tinamous, tinamous, depending, on, the, species, may, be, solitary, or, social, and, gather, in, groups, gregariousness, also, varies, by, season, forest, species, tend, to, be, solitary, and, may, only, approach, other, birds, during, the, breeding, season, some, live, as, mated, pairs, throughout, the, year, steppe, or, grassland, species, tend, to, live, in, groups, though, with, little, obvious, group, interaction, apart, from, an, occasional, contact, call, group, size, may, vary, by, season, in, winter, aggregations, of, elegant, crested, tinamous, may, approach, 100, birds, both, steppe, and, forest, species, are, territorial, though, territoriality, varies, between, species, from, being, characteristic, only, during, the, breeding, season, to, being, territorial, throughout, the, year, when, defending, their, territories, from, conspecifics, tinamous, are, highly, vocal, creating, a, cacophony, of, sound, when, an, intruder, is, noticed, birds, of, the, same, sex, will, confront, it, this, may, lead, to, conflict, with, feet, and, wings, being, used, in, attack, both, males, and, females, will, defend, their, territories, however, in, each, species, only, one, sex, is, fiercely, territorial, in, most, tinamou, species, the, males, practice, simultaneous, polygyny, and, the, females, sequential, polyandry, this, is, not, invariable, ornate, tinamous, form, stable, pairs, and, spotted, nothuras, are, monogamous, when, young, and, polygamous, when, older, there, are, larger, numbers, of, females, than, males, for, example, the, variegated, tinamou, has, a, female, to, male, ratio, of, 4, 1, the, breeding, season, varies, from, species, to, species, those, that, live, in, tropical, forests, where, there, is, little, seasonal, change, may, breed, at, any, time, though, there, is, usually, a, preferred, period, in, areas, with, a, marked, seasonal, fluctuation, tinamous, generally, breed, when, food, is, most, abundant, which, is, usually, summer, studies, have, shown, that, it, is, not, day, length, that, determines, the, onset, of, breeding, but, the, amount, of, light, through, cloud, cover, the, courtship, process, starts, with, the, male, vocally, advertising, his, abilities, with, continuous, calling, he, will, try, to, attract, multiple, females, in, tinamus, species, the, male, will, lower, his, chest, to, the, ground, stretch, his, neck, forward, and, fluff, up, his, back, to, appear, larger, than, normal, when, observed, head, on, all, of, the, bird, s, back, is, in, view, while, the, under, tail, coverts, are, exposed, a, pose, similar, to, that, used, by, the, rhea, the, female, will, scratch, her, feet, on, the, ground, as, part, of, the, ritual, tinamous, always, nest, on, the, ground, in, open, areas, near, a, bush, in, scrub, in, a, dense, patch, of, grass, in, forest, at, the, base, of, a, tree, trunk, between, the, buttresses, the, highland, tinamou, is, unique, in, that, it, sites, its, nest, in, a, cavity, or, under, an, overhanging, rock, on, a, steep, slope, many, species, do, not, build, a, nest, choosing, to, lay, their, eggs, on, a, thin, bed, of, leaves, other, species, do, construct, nests, and, are, meticulous, in, doing, so, the, nest, of, the, ornate, tinamou, is, circular, and, made, of, grass, on, a, turf, surface, the, male, brushland, tinamou, starts, to, scrape, out, a, nest, once, copulation, has, occurred, several, may, be, constructed, though, only, one, is, used, a, tinamou, female, lays, several, eggs, which, the, male, incubates, while, the, female, departs, to, seek, another, mate, large, species, will, lay, one, egg, every, 3, 4, days, while, the, smaller, ones, lay, on, consecutive, days, the, females, lay, eggs, in, multiple, nests, throughout, the, nesting, season, there, may, be, as, many, as, 16, eggs, in, a, clutch, a, consequence, of, several, females, laying, in, the, same, nest, the, more, mature, male, will, attract, more, females, and, may, have, the, eggs, of, up, to, four, females, under, him, the, variegated, and, ornate, tinamous, have, single, female, nests, and, consequently, only, one, or, two, eggs, per, nest, this, may, result, from, food, shortage, in, their, ranges, and, the, consequent, ability, to, care, for, only, one, or, two, chicks, the, eggs, are, fairly, deeply, colored, usually, in, a, single, color, and, have, a, hard, porcelain, like, gloss, colors, vary, with, species, ranging, through, green, purple, violet, turquoise, steel, grey, chocolate, and, lemon, yellow, white, is, rare, but, does, occur, though, the, eggs, are, bright, and, colorful, when, laid, over, time, they, fade, and, become, duller, for, example, the, egg, of, the, red, winged, tinamou, dulls, from, purple, to, leaden, most, tinamou, eggs, are, solid, colored, without, spots, or, speckling, however, the, eggs, of, tinamotis, species, may, exhibit, small, white, speckles, the, benefit, of, laying, brightly, colored, eggs, is, unknown, but, is, not, detrimental, as, most, tinamou, predators, hunt, at, night, eggs, are, relatively, large, compared, to, the, mass, of, the, female, though, even, the, largest, birds, produce, eggs, very, similar, in, size, to, the, smallest, of, species, their, shapes, are, either, spherical, or, elliptical, the, two, ends, are, similar, in, shape, and, difficult, to, distinguish, the, shells, are, thin, enough, to, see, the, embryos, within, incubation, takes, about, 16, days, in, crypturellus, which, contains, the, smallest, species, and, 19, 20, days, in, tinamus, and, eudromia, during, this, period, the, male, is, typically, silent, if, he, does, call, he, does, so, away, from, the, nest, as, he, incubates, he, will, leave, the, nest, to, feed, and, he, may, be, gone, from, 45, minutes, to, five, hours, covering, the, eggs, when, he, leaves, while, incubating, he, is, mainly, motionless, and, reluctant, to, move, even, from, potential, danger, it, is, possible, for, a, human, observer, to, approach, and, touch, the, incubating, male, without, eliciting, an, overt, response, some, species, will, flatten, themselves, against, the, ground, stretch, out, their, necks, and, raise, their, backs, to, the, air, this, posture, causes, them, to, resemble, a, plant, however, if, it, is, overdone, the, eggs, become, visible, from, behind, if, the, male, becomes, alarmed, enough, to, leave, the, nest, he, will, attempt, a, distraction, display, this, usually, involves, a, fake, injury, display, similar, to, that, of, the, killdeer, to, do, this, he, will, hop, on, one, leg, and, attempt, to, fly, always, falling, down, he, will, perform, this, display, if, the, eggs, have, not, hatched, or, the, chicks, are, still, too, young, to, fly, it, is, generally, believed, that, tinamous, are, not, as, effective, at, distraction, displays, as, other, birds, chicks, hatch, synchronously, with, a, dense, downy, coat, the, coloring, is, white, grey, or, yellow, with, dark, spots, to, aid, in, camouflage, the, young, are, precocial, and, can, run, almost, as, soon, as, they, hatch, soon, after, hatching, the, eggs, the, male, will, leave, the, nest, and, call, the, chicks, to, him, with, a, soft, contact, call, if, threatened, he, will, freeze, and, attempt, to, hide, the, chicks, under, his, wings, or, belly, there, have, been, documented, cases, of, females, caring, for, the, young, it, is, thought, that, this, occurs, when, the, male, has, been, killed, young, chicks, can, feed, themselves, within, the, first, few, days, but, the, male, will, bring, the, food, and, drop, it, on, the, ground, in, front, of, them, the, chicks, have, a, high, initial, mortality, rate, however, within, a, few, days, they, are, chasing, insects, on, their, own, and, at, 1, 3, weeks, they, can, fly, to, branches, a, metre, from, the, ground, they, are, self, sufficient, within, 20, days, by, 20, days, the, young, slaty, breasted, tinamou, has, gained, adult, size, though, not, adult, weight, the, spotted, nothura, will, go, from, 10, of, adult, weight, to, 90, within, 85, days, and, the, red, winged, tinamou, will, do, so, in, 108, days, sexual, maturity, comes, at, the, age, of, one, year, although, some, species, may, be, physiologically, mature, by, 57, days, however, some, behavior, may, need, to, be, learned, before, the, birds, can, breed, successfully, once, done, with, the, brood, the, male, if, still, within, the, breeding, season, will, seek, out, another, female, and, initiate, the, cycle, again, studies, have, shown, that, 54, 62, of, breeding, female, spotted, nothura, are, first, year, birds, tinamous, are, opportunistic, feeders, and, eat, a, wide, range, of, foods, though, each, species, varies, in, proportional, dietary, makeup, tinamou, genera, can, be, roughly, divided, into, three, groups, based, on, the, vegetable, component, of, their, diets, tinamus, nothocercus, and, crypturellus, focus, on, fleshy, fruit, nothura, nothoprocta, and, eudromia, comprising, open, country, birds, eat, mainly, seeds, and, other, soft, vegetative, matter, high, altitude, genera, living, in, harsh, environments, such, as, tinamotis, will, eat, most, of, the, plant, not, just, the, succulent, parts, most, species, eat, a, mixture, of, plant, and, animal, products, though, some, are, mainly, herbivorous, and, others, predominantly, insectivorous, or, carnivorous, diet, may, also, vary, seasonally, red, winged, tinamous, eat, mostly, animal, food, in, the, summer, and, plant, matter, in, the, winter, chicks, eat, more, insects, than, their, parents, probably, for, their, growth, needs, consumed, plant, material, includes, fruit, either, fallen, or, on, the, tree, seeds, green, shoots, tender, leaves, buds, flowers, tender, stems, roots, and, tubers, much, of, the, animal, food, consists, of, insects, including, ants, termites, beetles, grasshoppers, hemiptera, and, lepidopteran, larvae, as, well, as, gastropods, mollusks, worms, and, small, vertebrates, such, as, amphibians, and, reptiles, larger, species, will, eat, small, mammals, food, is, taken, mainly, off, the, ground, but, also, off, the, vine, the, birds, may, jump, for, fruit, or, as, with, the, crypturellus, species, jump, up, to, a, metre, in, height, for, insects, the, main, foraging, technique, is, a, slow, walk, with, head, down, pecking, at, the, ground, and, looking, up, occasionally, small, animals, are, eaten, whole, larger, ones, are, beaten, against, the, ground, or, pecked, bills, rather, than, feet, are, used, to, probe, leaf, litter, and, sift, through, soil, 2, to, 3, cm, 0, 8, 1, 2, in, deep, the, most, frequent, diggers, are, rhynchotus, nothura, and, nothoprocta, species, which, are, open, country, birds, they, have, their, nostrils, positioned, at, the, base, of, the, bills, a, feature, thought, to, be, an, adaptation, to, their, digging, as, with, most, birds, they, swallow, grit, to, aid, their, gizzards, in, digestion, some, species, follow, army, ants, eating, from, the, disturbance, created, others, feed, in, the, company, of, antbirds, formicariids, and, ovenbirds, nothura, species, in, particular, will, follow, livestock, and, eat, the, ticks, that, fall, off, them, as, well, as, the, insects, knocked, off, bushes, as, they, pass, water, is, required, by, most, tinamou, species, with, some, needing, a, good, source, within, their, home, territory, solitary, tinamous, can, withstand, an, extended, period, without, water, by, eating, more, succulent, plants, however, species, that, live, in, arid, or, semi, arid, climates, rarely, need, any, water, additional, to, that, ingested, with, their, diet, when, tinamous, drink, unlike, most, other, birds, they, do, so, by, sucking, and, swallowing, instead, of, lifting, their, heads, and, letting, gravity, do, the, work, tinamous, are, avid, bathers, during, heavy, rain, they, may, stand, erect, with, their, bill, pointing, skyward, allowing, the, rain, to, wash, over, them, they, will, dust, bathe, at, regular, intervals, and, have, been, known, to, dust, bathe, often, enough, to, tint, themselves, the, same, color, as, the, soil, they, also, sunbathe, and, will, do, so, while, resting, on, one, leg, with, an, outstretched, wing, defecation, for, a, tinamou, is, a, slightly, involved, task, as, it, must, move, aside, the, dense, plumage, that, surrounds, the, cloaca, to, avoid, soiling, itself, captive, tinamous, defecate, once, daily, there, are, over, 240, species, of, bird, lice, that, infest, tinamous, with, one, individual, bird, recorded, as, hosting, nine, species, blood, parasites, include, louse, flies, leeches, nematodes, cestodes, armadillo, ticks, mites, and, trematodes, darwin, s, nothura, may, carry, a, malarial, plasmodium, tinamou, predators, include, cats, foxes, raccoons, skunks, weasels, tayras, rats, peccaries, and, opossums, legend, speaks, of, jaguars, that, imitate, the, call, to, trick, and, catch, them, nests, are, vulnerable, to, snakes, monkeys, and, opossums, giant, anteaters, have, been, seen, on, marajo, island, breaking, tinamou, eggs, forest, falcons, and, orange, breasted, falcons, have, been, seen, hunting, them, and, vampire, bats, lap, their, blood, tinamous, have, established, themselves, in, the, folklore, and, histories, of, the, indigenous, people, of, south, america, and, central, america, forest, tribes, of, brazil, and, colombia, believe, the, jaguar, imitates, the, call, of, the, great, tinamou, in, order, to, track, and, eat, it, a, tale, from, the, guahibo, indians, tells, of, a, young, man, traveling, by, canoe, who, tried, to, locate, a, calling, tinamou, as, he, approached, the, bank, he, became, suspicious, at, the, harshness, of, the, call, and, backed, away, just, as, a, jaguar, burst, out, of, the, vegetation, panamanian, tradition, states, that, after, the, great, flood, the, great, tinamou, grew, frightened, of, the, bright, colors, in, the, rainbow, he, flew, away, from, the, rainbow, the, ark, and, the, rest, of, the, animals, heading, for, the, darkest, part, of, the, forest, where, he, has, remained, ever, since, a, brazilian, legend, explains, of, the, separation, of, the, red, winged, tinamou, and, the, undulated, tinamou, the, story, starts, off, with, how, inseparable, the, two, birds, were, as, they, did, everything, together, one, day, they, got, into, an, argument, and, split, up, the, undulated, tinamou, went, into, the, deepest, dark, of, the, forest, and, the, red, winged, tinamou, wanting, to, be, different, went, to, the, grassy, plains, one, day, the, undulated, tinamou, was, feeling, sad, and, lonely, went, to, the, forest, s, edge, and, called, his, old, friend, shall, we, make, up, he, cries, the, red, winged, tinamou, responds, with, what, me, never, again, this, story, is, meant, to, show, that, they, are, often, heard, but, seldom, seen, during, the, 20th, century, there, were, numerous, attempts, to, introduce, or, reintroduce, tinamous, to, various, parts, of, the, world, the, red, winged, tinamou, has, been, reintroduced, to, the, state, of, rio, de, janeiro, brazil, where, its, wild, population, was, hunted, to, extermination, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, france, germany, and, hungary, have, all, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, introduce, them, into, their, countryside, there, have, been, several, unsuccessful, attempts, to, introduce, tinamous, to, the, united, states, in, oregon, between, 1966, and, 1974, 473, ornate, tinamous, and, 110, red, winged, tinamou, were, brought, in, in, 1966, and, 1971, florida, introduced, 128, spotted, nothura, in, 1969, 47, and, 136, spotted, nothura, were, introduced, to, alabama, and, texas, 1970, saw, colorado, and, oklahoma, introducing, 164, and, 100, darwin, s, nothura, respectively, in, 1971, nebraska, brought, 256, elegant, crested, tinamou, and, california, introduced, 217, in, 1969, and, 1200, between, 1971, and, 1977, the, 1885, introduction, of, chilean, tinamou, to, easter, island, was, successful, though, the, population, has, not, prospered, since, chimango, caracaras, were, introduced, in, 1928, no, tinamou, species, has, been, successfully, domesticated, so, far, despite, their, ability, to, breed, well, in, captivity, the, red, winged, tinamou, has, been, bred, on, farms, in, france, great, britain, belgium, and, denmark, they, along, with, some, of, the, crypturellus, species, are, being, bred, in, rio, grande, do, sul, to, boost, numbers, for, hunting, hybridization, can, occur, many, south, american, zoos, hold, tinamous, as, do, some, private, estates, examples, of, captive, breeding, are, small, billed, tinamou, in, minas, gerais, and, red, winged, tinamou, in, rio, grande, do, sul, the, small, billed, tinamou, has, looked, promising, for, domestication, as, the, birds, can, raise, 3, 4, broods, per, year, and, are, resistant, to, diseases, that, affect, domestic, chickens, several, species, have, adapted, to, agricultural, systems, and, will, enter, grain, fields, after, the, harvest, to, glean, the, ground, they, will, also, enter, the, fields, during, the, growing, season, to, the, dismay, of, the, farmers, some, in, particular, the, ornate, and, andean, tinamous, will, dig, up, tubers, such, as, potatoes, while, red, winged, tinamous, create, similar, problems, in, peanut, plantations, however, some, members, of, nothoprocta, will, prey, on, insect, pests, without, damaging, the, crops, spotted, nothuras, have, been, documented, eating, weeds, and, of, the, 28, animals, they, were, recorded, as, eating, 26, were, considered, to, be, pests, the, tinamiformes, are, one, of, the, least, studied, orders, of, birds, despite, tinamous, exhibiting, rare, and, little, understood, behavioral, patterns, they, have, male, parental, care, which, is, not, always, associated, with, polyandry, or, sex, role, reversal, their, varied, mating, systems, and, diverse, habitats, have, the, potential, through, comparative, studies, to, explain, how, ecological, differences, affect, mating, strategies, in, some, species, females, cooperate, in, assembling, clutches, of, eggs, for, different, males, however, methodological, difficulties, have, hampered, behavioral, research, especially, on, the, forest, dwelling, species, because, their, secretive, behavior, and, cryptic, coloration, make, them, difficult, to, follow, for, continuous, observation, it, was, not, until, 2003, that, the, first, scientific, symposium, on, tinamous, was, organized, at, the, viith, neotropical, ornithological, congress, held, at, termas, de, puyehue, chile, the, status, of, the, family, is, not, easy, to, determine, as, many, species, live, in, the, amazon, basin, or, the, far, reaches, of, the, andes, and, attract, little, attention, even, from, ornithologists, moreover, their, cryptic, coloration, and, behavior, means, that, their, presence, often, remains, unnoticed, a, large, proportion, of, the, species, are, amazonian, with, the, majority, of, these, decreasing, in, range, most, however, are, surviving, well, enough, so, far, to, avoid, being, classified, as, threatened, major, threats, are, habitat, fragmentation, and, destruction, although, they, are, hunted, throughout, their, range, it, generally, has, little, or, only, localized, impact, on, the, populations, of, the, more, widespread, and, common, species, pesticides, are, a, problem, throughout, the, grasslands, and, farmlands, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, classifies, seven, tinamou, species, as, vulnerable, and, seven, as, near, threatened, the, solitary, tinamou, is, listed, under, appendix, i, of, cites, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, the, major, threat, for, the, forest, tinamous, is, deforestation, neotropical, forests, are, badly, affected, with, large, tracts, being, clearcut, for, cropping, pasture, or, timber, plantations, much, of, this, land, is, poor, in, nutrients, so, is, abandoned, after, a, few, years, for, newly, cleared, land, forest, species, are, consequently, forced, to, adapt, relocate, or, die, out, as, well, as, the, forests, most, types, of, habitat, in, middle, and, south, america, apart, from, the, high, andes, and, patagonia, are, under, threat, there, is, controversy, over, the, vegetative, history, with, speculation, that, what, is, now, high, altitude, grassland, in, the, andes, was, once, elfin, forest, the, dwarf, tinamou, is, a, resident, of, the, open, plains, of, eastern, brazil, though, there, are, fewer, than, 10, 000, birds, left, it, appears, to, have, disappeared, from, its, former, range, on, the, grasslands, of, argentina, and, paraguay, in, the, cerrado, grasslands, of, brazil, the, population, of, the, lesser, nothura, has, also, decreased, to, fewer, than, 10, 000, individuals, because, of, agricultural, and, economic, development, the, practice, of, burning, the, fields, is, particularly, detrimental, to, grassland, tinamous, for, example, the, dwarf, tinamou, becomes, intoxicated, with, the, smoke, and, vulnerable, to, predators, moreover, if, the, burning, occurs, during, the, nesting, season, the, eggs, or, chicks, are, roasted, the, solitary, tinamou, limited, to, the, atlantic, forests, of, brazil, paraguay, and, argentina, is, threatened, by, habitat, destruction, and, hunting, in, the, cloud, forests, of, northern, south, america, there, are, fewer, than, 10, 000, black, tinamous, left, the, tepui, tinamou, s, range, is, limited, to, the, tops, of, a, handful, of, plateaus, in, the, cloud, forests, of, venezuela, making, it, highly, vulnerable, to, any, threat, tinamous, have, been, popular, game, birds, for, many, years, in, south, america, and, central, america, so, much, so, that, some, species, numbers, have, dropped, the, steppe, birds, are, more, popular, to, hunt, because, they, can, be, flushed, into, flight, rather, than, the, forest, birds, that, run, to, cover, and, hide, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, hunting, was, responsible, for, mass, killing, within, the, family, with, the, elegant, crested, tinamou, and, spotted, nothura, popular, targets, in, 1921, argentina, urged, the, control, of, commercial, hunting, of, several, bird, species, including, tinamou, between, 1890, and, 1899, in, buenos, aires, alone, 18, million, tinamou, were, sold, in, meat, markets, they, were, also, marketed, in, north, america, as, south, american, partridge, one, shipment, alone, comprised, 360, 000, birds, frank, chapman, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, helped, raise, awareness, about, the, rate, of, exploitation, and, its, potential, impact, on, the, populations, of, the, species, eventually, the, usa, banned, the, importation, of, the, birds, hunting, pressures, remain, though, at, a, reduced, level, for, example, 25, 000, 40, 000, spotted, nothura, are, killed, annually, through, legal, hunting, not, counting, poaching, although, some, grassland, species, have, increased, in, both, range, and, numbers, they, remain, vulnerable, to, hunting, with, the, use, of, dogs, to, flush, them, native, peoples, also, are, involved, in, the, killing, tinamou, for, meat, catching, them, in, nooses, or, traps, after, imitating, their, calls, a, family, of, seven, in, cear, will, consume, 60, nothura, per, year, tinamou, species, are, among, the, most, commonly, harvested, birds, by, subsistence, hunting, in, the, americas, some, species, are, highly, vulnerable, to, illegal, hunting, or, poaching, in, brazil, illegal, hunts, take, place, at, night, by, torchlight, the, use, of, flutes, to, imitate, the, calls, during, the, breeding, season, to, lure, the, birds, into, the, open, can, result, in, local, extermination, overall, there, is, a, lack, of, adequate, controls, in, place, to, ensure, sustainable, hunting, as, well, as, insufficient, resources, and, determination, to, enforce, existing, regulations
