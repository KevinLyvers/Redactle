see, text, beech, fagus, is, a, genus, of, deciduous, trees, in, the, family, fagaceae, native, to, temperate, eurasia, and, north, america, there, are, 13, accepted, species, in, two, distinct, subgenera, engleriana, and, fagus, the, subgenus, engleriana, is, found, only, in, east, asia, distinctive, for, its, low, branches, often, made, up, of, several, major, trunks, with, yellowish, bark, the, better, known, fagus, subgenus, beeches, are, native, to, europe, and, north, america, they, are, high, branching, trees, with, tall, stout, trunks, and, smooth, silver, grey, bark, the, european, beech, fagus, sylvatica, is, the, most, commonly, cultivated, species, yielding, a, utility, timber, used, for, furniture, construction, flooring, and, engineering, purposes, in, plywood, and, household, items, the, timber, can, be, used, to, build, homes, beechwood, makes, excellent, firewood, slats, of, washed, beech, wood, are, spread, around, the, bottom, of, fermentation, tanks, for, budweiser, beer, beech, logs, are, burned, to, dry, the, malt, used, in, some, german, smoked, beers, beech, is, also, used, to, smoke, westphalian, ham, andouille, sausage, and, some, cheeses, beeches, are, monoecious, bearing, both, male, and, female, flowers, on, the, same, plant, the, small, flowers, are, unisexual, the, female, flowers, borne, in, pairs, the, male, flowers, wind, pollinating, catkins, they, are, produced, in, spring, shortly, after, the, new, leaves, appear, the, fruit, of, the, beech, tree, known, as, beechnuts, or, mast, is, found, in, small, burrs, that, drop, from, the, tree, in, autumn, they, are, small, roughly, triangular, and, edible, with, a, bitter, astringent, or, mild, and, nut, like, taste, the, european, beech, fagus, sylvatica, is, the, most, commonly, cultivated, although, few, important, differences, are, seen, between, species, aside, from, detail, elements, such, as, leaf, shape, the, leaves, of, beech, trees, are, entire, or, sparsely, toothed, from, 5, 15, centimetres, 2, 6, inches, long, and, 4, 10, cm, 2, 4, in, broad, the, bark, is, smooth, and, light, gray, the, fruit, is, a, small, sharply, three, angled, nut, 10, 15, mm, 3, 8, 5, 8, in, long, borne, singly, or, in, pairs, in, soft, spined, husks, 1, 5, 2, 5, cm, 5, 8, 1, in, long, known, as, cupules, the, husk, can, have, a, variety, of, spine, to, scale, like, appendages, the, character, of, which, is, in, addition, to, leaf, shape, one, of, the, primary, ways, beeches, are, differentiated, the, nuts, have, a, bitter, taste, though, not, nearly, as, bitter, as, acorns, and, a, high, tannin, content, these, are, called, beechnuts, or, beech, mast, recent, classification, systems, of, the, genus, recognize, 10, to, 13, species, in, two, distinct, subgenera, engleriana, and, fagus, the, engleriana, subgenus, is, found, only, in, east, asia, and, is, notably, distinct, from, the, fagus, subgenus, in, that, these, beeches, are, low, branching, trees, often, made, up, of, several, major, trunks, with, yellowish, bark, further, differentiating, characteristics, include, the, whitish, bloom, on, the, underside, of, the, leaves, the, visible, tertiary, leaf, veins, and, a, long, smooth, cupule, peduncle, proposed, by, botanist, chung, fu, shen, in, 1992, f, japonica, f, engleriana, and, f, okamotoi, comprise, this, subgenus, the, better, known, fagus, subgenus, beeches, are, high, branching, with, tall, stout, trunks, and, smooth, silver, gray, bark, this, group, includes, f, sylvatica, f, grandifolia, f, crenata, f, lucida, f, longipetiolata, and, f, hayatae, the, classification, of, the, european, beech, f, sylvatica, is, complex, with, a, variety, of, different, names, proposed, for, different, species, and, subspecies, within, this, region, for, example, f, taurica, f, orientalis, and, f, moesica, research, suggests, that, beeches, in, eurasia, differentiated, fairly, late, in, evolutionary, history, during, the, miocene, the, populations, in, this, area, represent, a, range, of, often, overlapping, morphotypes, and, genetic, analysis, does, not, clearly, support, separate, species, fagus, is, the, most, basal, group, in, the, evolution, of, the, fagaceae, family, which, also, includes, oaks, and, chestnuts, the, southern, beeches, genus, nothofagus, previously, thought, closely, related, to, beeches, are, now, treated, as, members, of, a, separate, family, the, nothofagaceae, which, remains, a, member, of, the, order, fagales, they, are, found, throughout, the, southern, hemisphere, in, australia, new, zealand, new, guinea, new, caledonia, as, well, as, argentina, and, chile, principally, patagonia, and, tierra, del, fuego, species, accepted, by, plants, of, the, world, online, as, of, april, 2023, numerous, species, have, been, named, globally, from, the, fossil, record, spanning, from, the, cretaceous, to, the, pleistocene, fossil, species, formerly, placed, in, fagus, include, the, name, of, the, tree, in, latin, fagus, from, whence, the, generic, epithet, is, cognate, with, english, beech, and, of, indo, european, origin, and, played, an, important, role, in, early, debates, on, the, geographical, origins, of, the, indo, european, people, the, beech, argument, greek, fig, s, is, from, the, same, root, but, the, word, was, transferred, to, the, oak, tree, e, g, iliad, 16, 767, as, a, result, of, the, absence, of, beech, trees, in, southern, greece, fagus, sylvatica, was, a, late, entrant, to, great, britain, after, the, last, glaciation, and, may, have, been, restricted, to, basic, soils, in, the, south, of, england, some, suggest, that, it, was, introduced, by, neolithic, tribes, who, planted, the, trees, for, their, edible, nuts, the, beech, is, classified, as, a, native, in, the, south, of, england, and, as, a, non, native, in, the, north, where, it, is, often, removed, from, native, woods, large, areas, of, the, chilterns, are, covered, with, beech, woods, which, are, habitat, to, the, common, bluebell, and, other, flora, the, cwm, clydach, national, nature, reserve, in, southeast, wales, was, designated, for, its, beech, woodlands, which, are, believed, to, be, on, the, western, edge, of, their, natural, range, in, this, steep, limestone, gorge, beech, is, not, native, to, ireland, however, it, was, widely, planted, in, the, 18th, century, and, can, become, a, problem, shading, out, the, native, woodland, understory, beech, is, widely, planted, for, hedging, and, in, deciduous, woodlands, and, mature, regenerating, stands, occur, throughout, mainland, britain, at, elevations, below, about, 650, m, 2, 100, ft, the, tallest, and, longest, hedge, in, the, world, according, to, guinness, world, records, is, the, meikleour, beech, hedge, in, meikleour, perth, and, kinross, scotland, fagus, sylvatica, is, one, of, the, most, common, hardwood, trees, in, north, central, europe, in, france, constituting, alone, about, 15, of, all, nonconifers, the, balkans, are, also, home, to, the, lesser, known, oriental, beech, f, orientalis, and, crimean, beech, f, taurica, as, a, naturally, growing, forest, tree, beech, marks, the, important, border, between, the, european, deciduous, forest, zone, and, the, northern, pine, forest, zone, this, border, is, important, for, wildlife, and, fauna, in, denmark, and, scania, at, the, southernmost, peak, of, the, scandinavian, peninsula, southwest, of, the, natural, spruce, boundary, it, is, the, most, common, forest, tree, it, grows, naturally, in, denmark, and, southern, norway, and, sweden, up, to, about, 57, 59, n, the, most, northern, known, naturally, growing, not, planted, beech, trees, are, found, in, a, small, grove, north, of, bergen, on, the, west, coast, of, norway, near, the, city, of, larvik, is, the, largest, naturally, occurring, beech, forest, in, norway, b, keskogen, some, research, suggests, that, early, agriculture, patterns, supported, the, spread, of, beech, in, continental, europe, research, has, linked, the, establishment, of, beech, stands, in, scandinavia, and, germany, with, cultivation, and, fire, disturbance, i, e, early, agricultural, practices, other, areas, which, have, a, long, history, of, cultivation, bulgaria, for, example, do, not, exhibit, this, pattern, so, how, much, human, activity, has, influenced, the, spread, of, beech, trees, is, as, yet, unclear, the, primeval, beech, forests, of, the, carpathians, are, also, an, example, of, a, singular, complete, and, comprehensive, forest, dominated, by, a, single, tree, species, the, beech, tree, forest, dynamics, here, were, allowed, to, proceed, without, interruption, or, interference, since, the, last, ice, age, nowadays, they, are, amongst, the, last, pure, beech, forests, in, europe, to, document, the, undisturbed, postglacial, repopulation, of, the, species, which, also, includes, the, unbroken, existence, of, typical, animals, and, plants, these, virgin, beech, forests, and, similar, forests, across, 12, countries, in, continental, europe, were, inscribed, on, the, unesco, world, heritage, list, in, 2007, the, american, beech, fagus, grandifolia, occurs, across, much, of, the, eastern, united, states, and, southeastern, canada, with, a, disjunct, population, in, mexico, it, is, the, only, fagus, species, in, the, western, hemisphere, before, the, pleistocene, ice, age, it, is, believed, to, have, spanned, the, entire, width, of, the, continent, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, pacific, but, now, is, confined, to, the, east, of, the, great, plains, f, grandifolia, tolerates, hotter, climates, than, european, species, but, is, not, planted, much, as, an, ornamental, due, to, slower, growth, and, less, resistance, to, urban, pollution, it, most, commonly, occurs, as, an, overstory, component, in, the, northern, part, of, its, range, with, sugar, maple, transitioning, to, other, forest, types, further, south, such, as, beech, magnolia, american, beech, is, rarely, encountered, in, developed, areas, except, as, a, remnant, of, a, forest, that, was, cut, down, for, land, development, the, dead, brown, leaves, of, the, american, beech, remain, on, the, branches, until, well, into, the, following, spring, when, the, new, buds, finally, push, them, off, east, asia, is, home, to, five, species, of, fagus, only, one, of, which, f, crenata, is, occasionally, planted, in, western, countries, smaller, than, f, sylvatica, and, f, grandifolia, this, beech, is, one, of, the, most, common, hardwoods, in, its, native, range, beech, grows, on, a, wide, range, of, soil, types, acidic, or, basic, provided, they, are, not, waterlogged, the, tree, canopy, casts, dense, shade, and, thickens, the, ground, with, leaf, litter, in, north, america, they, can, form, beech, maple, climax, forests, by, partnering, with, the, sugar, maple, the, beech, blight, aphid, grylloprociphilus, imbricator, is, a, common, pest, of, american, beech, trees, beeches, are, also, used, as, food, plants, by, some, species, of, lepidoptera, beech, bark, is, extremely, thin, and, scars, easily, since, the, beech, tree, has, such, delicate, bark, carvings, such, as, lovers, initials, and, other, forms, of, graffiti, remain, because, the, tree, is, unable, to, heal, itself, beech, bark, disease, is, a, fungal, infection, that, attacks, the, american, beech, through, damage, caused, by, scale, insects, infection, can, lead, to, the, death, of, the, tree, beech, leaf, disease, is, a, disease, that, affects, american, beeches, spread, by, the, newly, discovered, nematode, litylenchus, crenatae, mccannii, this, disease, was, first, discovered, in, lake, county, ohio, in, 2012, and, has, now, spread, to, over, 41, counties, in, ohio, pennsylvania, new, york, and, ontario, canada, as, of, 2024, the, disease, has, become, widespread, in, connecticut, massachusetts, and, rhode, island, and, in, portions, of, coastal, new, hampshire, and, coastal, and, central, maine, the, beech, most, commonly, grown, as, an, ornamental, tree, is, the, european, beech, fagus, sylvatica, widely, cultivated, in, north, america, as, well, as, its, native, europe, many, varieties, are, in, cultivation, notably, the, weeping, beech, f, sylvatica, pendula, several, varieties, of, copper, or, purple, beech, the, fern, leaved, beech, f, sylvatica, asplenifolia, and, the, tricolour, beech, f, sylvatica, roseomarginata, the, columnar, dawyck, beech, f, sylvatica, dawyck, occurs, in, green, gold, and, purple, forms, named, after, dawyck, botanic, garden, in, the, scottish, borders, one, of, the, four, garden, sites, of, the, royal, botanic, garden, edinburgh, beech, wood, is, an, excellent, firewood, easily, split, and, burning, for, many, hours, with, bright, but, calm, flames, slats, of, beech, wood, are, washed, in, caustic, soda, to, leach, out, any, flavour, or, aroma, characteristics, and, are, spread, around, the, bottom, of, fermentation, tanks, for, budweiser, beer, this, provides, a, complex, surface, on, which, the, yeast, can, settle, so, that, it, does, not, pile, up, preventing, yeast, autolysis, which, would, contribute, off, flavours, to, the, beer, beech, logs, are, burned, to, dry, the, malt, used, in, german, smoked, beers, beech, is, also, used, to, smoke, westphalian, ham, traditional, andouille, an, offal, sausage, from, normandy, and, some, cheeses, some, drums, are, made, from, beech, which, has, a, tone, between, those, of, maple, and, birch, the, two, most, popular, drum, woods, the, textile, modal, is, a, kind, of, rayon, often, made, wholly, from, reconstituted, cellulose, of, pulped, beech, wood, the, european, species, fagus, sylvatica, yields, a, tough, utility, timber, it, weighs, about, 720, kg, per, cubic, metre, and, is, widely, used, for, furniture, construction, flooring, and, engineering, purposes, in, plywood, and, household, items, but, rarely, as, a, decorative, wood, the, timber, can, be, used, to, build, chalets, houses, and, log, cabins, beech, wood, is, used, for, the, stocks, of, military, rifles, when, traditionally, preferred, woods, such, as, walnut, are, scarce, or, unavailable, or, as, a, lower, cost, alternative, the, edible, fruit, of, the, beech, tree, known, as, beechnuts, or, mast, is, found, in, small, burrs, that, drop, from, the, tree, in, autumn, they, are, small, roughly, triangular, and, edible, with, a, bitter, astringent, or, in, some, cases, mild, and, nut, like, taste, according, to, the, roman, statesman, pliny, the, elder, in, his, work, natural, history, beechnut, was, eaten, by, the, people, of, chios, when, the, town, was, besieged, writing, of, the, fruit, that, of, the, beech, is, the, sweetest, of, all, so, much, so, that, according, to, cornelius, alexander, the, people, of, the, city, of, chios, when, besieged, supported, themselves, wholly, on, mast, they, can, also, be, roasted, and, pulverized, into, an, adequate, coffee, substitute, the, leaves, can, be, steeped, in, liquor, to, give, a, light, green, yellow, liqueur, in, antiquity, the, bark, of, the, beech, tree, was, used, by, indo, european, people, for, writing, related, purposes, especially, in, a, religious, context, beech, wood, tablets, were, a, common, writing, material, in, germanic, societies, before, the, development, of, paper, the, old, english, b, c, has, the, primary, sense, of, beech, but, also, a, secondary, sense, of, book, and, it, is, from, b, c, that, the, modern, word, derives, in, modern, german, the, word, for, book, is, buch, with, buche, meaning, beech, tree, in, modern, dutch, the, word, for, book, is, boek, with, beuk, meaning, beech, tree, in, swedish, these, words, are, the, same, bok, meaning, both, beech, tree, and, book, there, is, a, similar, relationship, in, some, slavic, languages, in, russian, and, bulgarian, the, word, for, beech, is, buk, while, that, for, letter, as, in, a, letter, of, the, alphabet, is, bukva, while, serbo, croatian, and, slovene, use, bukva, to, refer, to, the, tree, the, pigment, bistre, was, made, from, beech, wood, soot, beech, litter, raking, as, a, replacement, for, straw, in, animal, husbandry, was, an, old, non, timber, practice, in, forest, management, that, once, occurred, in, parts, of, switzerland, in, the, 17th, century, beech, has, been, listed, as, one, of, the, 38, plants, whose, flowers, are, used, to, prepare, bach, flower, remedies
