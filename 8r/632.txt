the, rock, dove, rock, pigeon, or, common, pigeon, p, d, n, also, p, d, n, columba, livia, is, a, member, of, the, bird, family, columbidae, doves, and, pigeons, 624, in, common, usage, it, is, often, simply, referred, to, as, the, pigeon, although, this, is, the, wild, form, of, the, bird, the, pigeons, most, familiar, to, people, are, the, domesticated, form, of, the, wild, rock, dove, the, domestic, pigeon, columba, livia, domestica, which, includes, about, 1, 000, different, breeds, descended, from, this, species, escaped, domestic, pigeons, have, increased, the, populations, of, feral, pigeons, around, the, world, wild, rock, doves, are, pale, grey, with, two, black, bars, on, each, wing, whereas, domestic, and, feral, pigeons, vary, in, the, colour, and, pattern, of, their, plumage, few, differences, are, seen, between, males, and, females, i, e, they, are, not, strongly, sexually, dimorphic, the, species, is, generally, monogamous, with, two, squabs, young, per, brood, both, parents, care, for, the, young, for, a, time, habitats, include, various, open, and, semi, open, environments, where, they, are, able, to, forage, on, the, ground, cliffs, and, rock, ledges, are, used, for, roosting, and, breeding, in, the, wild, originating, in, southern, europe, north, africa, and, western, asia, pigeons, have, become, established, in, cities, around, the, world, a, commonly, cited, example, of, a, least, concern, species, per, iucn, among, birds, the, rock, doves, are, abundant, with, an, estimated, population, of, 17, to, 28, million, feral, and, wild, birds, in, europe, alone, and, up, to, 120, million, worldwide, the, official, common, name, is, rock, dove, as, given, by, the, international, ornithological, congress, the, rock, dove, was, formally, described, in, 1789, by, the, german, naturalist, johann, friedrich, gmelin, in, his, revised, and, expanded, edition, of, systema, naturae, written, by, carl, linnaeus, he, placed, it, with, all, the, other, doves, and, pigeons, in, the, genus, columba, and, coined, the, binomial, name, columba, livia, the, genus, name, columba, is, the, latin, word, meaning, pigeon, dove, whose, older, etymology, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, kolumbos, a, diver, from, kolumbao, dive, plunge, headlong, swim, aristophanes, birds, 304, and, others, use, the, word, kolumbis, diver, for, the, name, of, the, bird, because, of, its, swimming, motion, in, the, air, the, specific, epithet, livia, is, a, medieval, latin, variant, of, livida, livid, bluish, grey, this, was, theodorus, gaza, s, translation, of, greek, peleia, dove, itself, thought, to, be, derived, from, pellos, dark, coloured, 228, its, closest, relative, in, the, genus, columba, is, the, hill, pigeon, followed, by, the, other, rock, pigeons, the, snow, speckled, and, white, collared, pigeons, pigeon, chicks, are, called, squabs, note, that, members, of, the, lesser, known, pigeon, genus, petrophassa, and, the, speckled, pigeon, columba, guinea, also, have, the, common, name, rock, pigeon, the, rock, dove, was, first, described, by, german, naturalist, johann, gmelin, in, 1789, the, rock, dove, was, central, to, charles, darwin, s, discovery, of, evolution, and, featured, in, four, of, his, works, from, 1859, to, 1872, darwin, posited, that, despite, wide, ranging, morphological, differences, the, many, hundreds, of, breeds, of, domestic, pigeon, could, all, be, traced, back, to, the, wild, rock, dove, in, essence, human, selection, of, pigeon, breeds, was, analogous, to, natural, selection, nine, subspecies, are, recognised, centuries, of, domestication, have, greatly, altered, the, rock, dove, feral, pigeons, which, have, escaped, domestication, throughout, history, have, significant, variations, in, plumage, when, not, specified, descriptions, are, for, assumed, wild, type, though, the, wild, type, may, be, on, the, verge, of, extinction, or, already, extinct, the, adult, of, the, nominate, subspecies, of, the, rock, dove, is, 29, to, 37, cm, 11, to, 15, in, long, with, a, 62, to, 72, cm, 24, to, 28, in, wingspan, weight, for, wild, or, feral, rock, doves, ranges, from, 238, 380, g, 8, 4, 13, 4, oz, though, overfed, domestic, and, semidomestic, individuals, can, exceed, normal, weights, it, has, a, dark, bluish, grey, head, neck, and, chest, with, glossy, yellowish, greenish, and, reddish, purple, iridescence, along, its, neck, and, wing, feathers, the, iris, is, orange, red, or, golden, with, a, paler, inner, ring, and, the, bare, skin, round, the, eye, is, bluish, grey, the, bill, is, grey, black, with, a, conspicuous, off, white, cere, and, the, feet, are, purplish, red, among, standard, measurements, the, wing, chord, is, typically, around, 22, 3, cm, 8, 8, in, the, tail, is, 9, 5, to, 11, cm, 3, 7, to, 4, 3, in, the, bill, is, around, 1, 8, cm, 0, 71, in, and, the, tarsus, is, 2, 6, to, 3, 5, cm, 1, 0, to, 1, 4, in, the, adult, female, is, almost, identical, in, outward, appearance, to, the, male, but, the, iridescence, on, her, neck, is, less, intense, and, more, restricted, to, the, rear, and, sides, whereas, that, on, the, breast, is, often, very, obscure, the, white, lower, back, of, the, pure, rock, dove, is, its, best, identification, characteristic, the, two, black, bars, on, its, pale, grey, wings, are, also, distinctive, the, tail, has, a, black, band, on, the, end, and, the, outer, web, of, the, tail, feathers, are, margined, with, white, it, is, strong, and, quick, on, the, wing, dashing, out, from, sea, caves, flying, low, over, the, water, its, lighter, grey, rump, showing, well, from, above, young, birds, show, little, lustre, and, are, duller, eye, colour, of, the, pigeon, is, generally, orange, but, a, few, pigeons, may, have, white, grey, eyes, the, eyelids, are, orange, and, encapsulated, in, a, grey, white, eye, ring, the, feet, are, red, to, pink, the, subspecies, gymnocycla, is, smaller, and, very, much, darker, than, the, nominate, subspecies, it, is, almost, blackish, on, the, head, rump, and, underparts, with, a, white, back, and, the, iridescence, of, the, nape, extending, onto, the, head, subspecies, targia, is, slightly, smaller, than, the, nominate, with, similar, plumage, but, the, back, is, concolorous, with, the, mantle, instead, of, white, subspecies, dakhlae, is, smaller, and, much, paler, than, the, nominate, subspecies, schimperi, closely, resembles, targia, but, has, a, distinctly, paler, mantle, subspecies, palaestinae, is, slightly, larger, than, schimperi, and, has, darker, plumage, subspecies, gaddi, is, larger, and, paler, than, palaestinae, with, which, it, intergrades, in, the, west, subspecies, neglecta, it, is, similar, to, the, nominate, in, size, but, darker, with, a, stronger, and, more, extensive, iridescent, sheen, on, the, neck, it, intergrades, with, gaddi, in, the, south, subspecies, intermedia, is, similar, to, neglecta, but, darker, with, a, less, contrasting, back, 176, 179, there, have, been, numerous, skeletal, descriptions, of, the, rock, dove, and, the, associated, muscles, including, those, of, the, eye, jaw, neck, and, throat, the, skull, is, dominated, by, the, rostrum, eye, socket, and, braincase, the, quadrate, bone, is, relatively, small, and, mobile, and, connects, the, rest, of, the, cranium, to, the, lower, jaw, the, latter, has, an, angled, shape, in, side, view, because, the, long, axis, of, the, front, half, of, the, lower, jaw, is, at, a, 30, angle, to, the, back, half, beneath, the, skull, the, hyoid, skeleton, involves, three, mid, line, structures, and, a, pair, of, elongate, structures, that, stem, from, between, the, junction, of, the, back, two, structures, the, anterior, structure, the, paraglossum, or, entoglossum, is, unpaired, and, shaped, like, an, arrowhead, when, circling, overhead, the, white, underwing, of, the, bird, becomes, conspicuous, in, its, flight, behaviour, and, voice, which, is, more, of, a, dovecot, coo, than, the, phrase, of, the, wood, pigeon, it, is, a, typical, pigeon, although, it, is, a, relatively, strong, flier, it, also, glides, frequently, holding, its, wings, in, a, very, pronounced, v, shape, as, it, does, as, prey, birds, they, must, keep, their, vigilance, and, when, disturbed, a, pigeon, within, a, flock, will, take, off, with, a, noisy, clapping, sound, that, cues, for, other, pigeons, to, take, to, flight, the, noise, of, the, take, off, increases, the, faster, a, pigeon, beats, its, wings, thus, advertising, the, magnitude, of, a, perceived, threat, to, its, flockmates, feral, pigeons, are, essentially, the, same, size, and, shape, as, the, original, wild, rock, dove, but, often, display, far, greater, variation, in, colour, and, pattern, compared, to, their, wild, ancestors, the, blue, barred, pattern, which, the, original, wild, rock, dove, displays, is, generally, less, common, in, more, urban, areas, urban, pigeons, tend, to, have, darker, plumage, than, those, in, more, rural, areas, pigeons, feathers, have, two, types, of, melanin, pigment, eumelanin, and, pheomelanin, a, study, of, melanin, in, the, feathers, of, both, wild, rock, and, domestic, pigeons, of, different, coloration, types, and, known, genetic, background, measured, the, concentration, distribution, and, proportions, of, eumelanin, and, pheomelanin, and, found, that, gene, mutations, affecting, the, distribution, amounts, and, proportions, of, pigments, accounted, for, the, greater, variation, of, coloration, in, domesticated, birds, than, in, their, wild, relations, eumelanin, generally, causes, grey, or, black, coloration, while, pheomelanin, results, in, a, reddish, brown, colour, other, shades, of, brown, may, be, produced, through, different, combinations, and, concentrations, of, the, two, colours, as, in, other, animals, white, pigeons, have, little, to, no, pigment, darker, birds, may, be, better, able, to, store, trace, metals, in, their, feathers, due, to, their, higher, concentrations, of, melanin, which, may, help, mitigate, the, negative, effects, of, the, metals, the, concentrations, of, which, are, typically, higher, in, urban, areas, pigeons, especially, homing, or, carrier, breeds, are, well, known, for, their, ability, to, find, their, way, home, from, long, distances, despite, these, demonstrated, abilities, wild, rock, doves, are, sedentary, and, rarely, leave, their, local, areas, it, is, hypothesized, that, in, their, natural, arid, habitat, they, rely, on, this, sense, to, navigate, back, home, after, foraging, as, deserts, rarely, possess, navigational, landmarks, that, may, be, used, a, rock, pigeon, s, lifespan, ranges, from, 3, 5, years, in, the, wild, to, 15, years, in, captivity, though, longer, lived, specimens, have, been, reported, the, main, causes, of, mortality, in, the, wild, are, predators, and, persecution, by, humans, some, sources, state, the, species, was, first, introduced, to, north, america, in, 1606, at, port, royal, nova, scotia, although, other, sources, cite, plymouth, and, jamestown, settlements, in, the, early, 17th, century, as, the, first, place, for, species, introduction, in, north, america, the, call, is, a, soft, slightly, wavering, coo, ornithologist, david, sibley, describes, the, display, call, as, a, whoo, hoo, witoo, hoo, whereas, the, cornell, lab, of, ornithology, describes, it, as, a, coo, roo, c, too, coo, variations, include, an, alarm, call, a, nest, call, and, noises, made, by, juveniles, sibley, describes, the, nest, call, as, a, repeated, hu, hu, hurrr, when, displaying, songs, are, partly, sexual, partly, threatening, they, are, accompanied, by, an, inflated, throat, tail, fanning, strutting, and, bowing, the, alarm, call, given, at, sight, of, predators, is, a, grunt, like, oorhh, non, vocal, sounds, include, a, loud, flapping, noise, at, take, off, feet, stomping, hisses, and, beak, snapping, wings, may, also, be, clapped, during, flights, usually, during, display, fights, or, after, copulation, juveniles, particularly, snap, their, bills, usually, to, respond, to, nest, invasion, the, foot, stomping, appears, deliberate, though, for, what, purpose, is, unclear, foot, stomping, is, done, with, a, certain, foot, first, showing, that, rock, doves, have, footedness, similar, to, human, handedness, before, the, columbian, exchange, rock, doves, were, restricted, to, a, natural, resident, range, in, western, and, southern, europe, north, africa, and, extending, into, south, asia, they, were, carried, into, the, new, world, aboard, european, ships, between, 1603, and, 1607, the, species, including, ferals, has, a, large, range, with, an, estimated, global, extent, of, occurrence, of, 10, 000, 000, km, 2, 3, 900, 000, sq, mi, it, has, a, large, global, population, including, an, estimated, 17, to, 28, million, individuals, in, europe, fossil, evidence, suggests, the, rock, dove, originated, in, southern, asia, and, skeletal, remains, unearthed, in, israel, confirm, its, existence, there, for, at, least, 300, 000, years, however, this, species, has, such, a, long, history, with, humans, that, it, is, impossible, to, identify, its, original, range, exactly, wild, pigeons, reside, in, rock, formations, and, cliff, faces, settling, in, crevices, to, nest, they, nest, communally, often, forming, large, colonies, of, many, hundreds, of, individuals, wild, nesting, sites, include, caves, canyons, and, sea, cliffs, they, will, even, live, in, the, sahara, so, long, as, an, area, has, rocks, water, and, some, plant, matter, they, prefer, to, avoid, dense, vegetation, rock, doves, have, a, commensal, relationship, with, humans, gaining, both, ample, access, to, food, and, nesting, spots, in, civilized, areas, human, structures, provide, an, excellent, imitation, of, cliff, structures, making, rock, doves, very, common, around, human, habitation, skyscrapers, highway, overpasses, farm, buildings, abandoned, buildings, and, other, human, structures, with, ample, crevices, are, conducive, to, rock, dove, nesting, thus, the, modern, range, of, the, rock, dove, is, due, in, large, part, to, humans, agricultural, settlements, are, favoured, over, forested, ones, ideal, human, nesting, attributes, combine, areas, with, tall, buildings, green, spaces, ample, access, to, human, food, and, schools, conversely, suburban, areas, which, are, far, from, city, centers, and, have, high, street, density, are, the, least, conducive, to, pigeons, their, versatility, among, human, structures, is, evidenced, by, a, population, living, inside, a, deep, well, in, tunisia, feral, pigeons, are, usually, unable, to, find, these, accommodations, so, they, must, nest, on, building, ledges, walls, or, statues, they, may, damage, these, structures, via, their, faeces, starving, birds, can, only, excrete, urates, which, over, time, corrodes, masonry, and, metal, in, contrast, a, well, fed, bird, passes, mostly, solid, faeces, containing, only, small, amounts, of, uric, acid, pigeons, are, often, found, in, pairs, in, the, breeding, season, but, are, usually, gregarious, the, rock, dove, breeds, at, any, time, of, the, year, but, peak, times, are, spring, and, summer, nesting, sites, are, along, coastal, cliff, faces, as, well, as, the, artificial, cliff, faces, created, by, apartment, buildings, with, accessible, ledges, or, roof, spaces, pigeons, can, compete, with, native, birds, for, nest, sites, for, some, avian, species, such, as, seabirds, it, could, be, a, conservation, issue, current, evidence, suggests, that, wild, domestic, and, feral, pigeons, mate, for, life, although, their, long, term, bonds, are, not, unbreakable, they, are, socially, monogamous, but, extra, pair, matings, do, occur, often, initiated, by, males, due, to, their, ability, to, produce, crop, milk, pigeons, can, breed, at, any, time, of, year, pigeons, breed, when, the, food, supply, is, abundant, enough, to, support, embryonic, egg, development, which, in, cities, can, be, any, time, of, the, year, laying, of, eggs, can, take, place, up, to, six, times, per, year, pigeons, are, often, found, in, pairs, during, the, breeding, season, but, usually, the, pigeons, are, gregarious, living, in, flocks, of, 50, to, 500, birds, dependent, on, the, food, supply, courtship, rituals, can, be, observed, in, urban, parks, at, any, time, of, the, year, the, male, on, the, ground, or, rooftops, puffs, up, the, feathers, on, his, neck, to, appear, larger, and, thereby, impress, or, attract, attention, he, approaches, the, female, at, a, rapid, walking, pace, while, emitting, repetitive, quiet, notes, often, bowing, and, turning, as, he, comes, closer, at, first, the, female, invariably, walks, or, flies, a, short, distance, away, and, the, male, follows, her, until, she, stops, at, this, point, he, continues, the, bowing, motion, and, very, often, makes, full, or, half, pirouettes, in, front, of, the, female, the, male, then, proceeds, to, feed, the, female, by, regurgitating, food, as, they, do, when, feeding, the, young, the, male, then, mounts, the, female, rearing, backwards, to, be, able, to, join, their, cloacae, the, mating, is, very, brief, with, the, male, flapping, his, wings, to, maintain, balance, on, top, of, the, female, the, nest, is, a, flimsy, platform, of, straw, and, sticks, laid, on, a, ledge, under, cover, often, on, the, window, ledges, of, buildings, two, white, eggs, are, laid, incubation, shared, by, both, parents, lasts, 17, to, 19, days, the, newly, hatched, squab, nestling, has, pale, yellow, down, and, a, flesh, coloured, bill, with, a, dark, band, for, the, first, few, days, the, baby, squabs, are, tended, and, fed, through, regurgitation, exclusively, on, crop, milk, also, called, pigeon, milk, or, pigeon, s, milk, the, pigeon, milk, is, produced, in, the, crops, of, both, parents, in, all, species, of, pigeon, and, dove, pigeons, are, altricial, and, their, fledging, period, is, about, 30, days, rock, doves, are, omnivorous, but, prefer, plant, matter, chiefly, fruits, and, grains, studies, of, pigeons, in, a, semi, rural, part, of, kansas, found, that, their, diet, includes, the, following, 92, maize, 3, 2, oats, 3, 7, cherry, along, with, small, amounts, of, knotweed, elm, poison, ivy, and, barley, feral, pigeons, can, be, seen, eating, grass, seeds, and, berries, in, parks, and, gardens, in, the, spring, but, plentiful, sources, exist, throughout, the, year, from, scavenging, e, g, food, remnants, left, inside, of, dropped, fast, food, cartons, in, the, form, of, popcorn, cake, peanuts, bread, and, currants, and, they, also, eat, insects, and, spiders, additional, food, is, also, usually, available, from, waste, bins, tourists, or, residents, who, feed, bird, seed, to, pigeons, for, reasons, such, as, empathy, fun, tradition, and, as, a, means, for, social, interaction, pigeons, tend, to, congregate, in, large, often, thick, flocks, when, feeding, on, discarded, food, and, may, be, observed, flying, skillfully, around, trees, buildings, telephone, poles, and, cables, and, even, through, moving, traffic, just, to, reach, a, food, source, pigeons, feed, on, the, ground, in, flocks, or, individually, pigeons, are, naturally, granivorous, eating, seeds, that, fit, down, their, gullet, they, may, sometimes, consume, small, invertebrates, such, as, worms, or, insect, larvae, as, a, protein, supplement, as, they, do, not, possess, an, enlarged, cecum, as, in, european, wood, pigeons, they, cannot, digest, adult, plant, tissue, the, various, seeds, they, eat, contain, the, appropriate, nutrients, they, require, while, most, birds, take, small, sips, and, tilt, their, heads, backwards, when, drinking, pigeons, are, able, to, dip, their, bills, into, the, water, and, drink, continuously, without, having, to, tilt, their, heads, back, in, cities, they, typically, resort, to, scavenging, human, garbage, as, unprocessed, grain, may, be, impossible, to, find, pigeon, groups, typically, consist, of, producers, which, locate, and, obtain, food, and, scroungers, which, feed, on, food, obtained, by, the, producers, generally, groups, of, pigeons, contain, a, greater, proportion, of, scroungers, than, producers, pigeons, primarily, use, powder, down, feathers, for, preening, which, gives, a, soft, and, silky, feel, to, their, plumage, they, have, no, preen, gland, or, at, times, have, very, rudimentary, preen, glands, so, oil, is, not, used, for, preening, rather, powder, down, feathers, are, spread, across, the, body, these, have, a, tendency, to, disintegrate, and, the, powder, akin, to, talcum, powder, helps, maintain, the, plumage, some, varieties, of, domestic, pigeon, have, modified, feathers, called, fat, quills, these, feathers, contain, yellow, oil, like, fat, that, derives, from, the, same, cells, as, powder, down, this, is, used, while, preening, and, helps, reduce, bacterial, degradation, of, feathers, by, feather, bacilli, with, only, their, flying, abilities, protecting, them, from, predation, rock, pigeons, are, a, favourite, almost, around, the, world, for, a, wide, range, of, raptors, in, fact, with, feral, pigeons, existing, in, almost, every, city, in, the, world, they, may, form, the, majority, of, prey, for, several, raptor, species, that, live, in, urban, areas, peregrine, falcons, and, eurasian, sparrowhawks, are, natural, predators, of, pigeons, and, quite, adept, at, catching, and, feeding, upon, this, species, up, to, 80, of, the, diet, of, peregrine, falcons, in, several, cities, that, have, breeding, falcons, is, composed, of, feral, pigeons, some, common, predators, of, feral, pigeons, in, north, america, are, raccoons, opossums, red, tailed, hawks, great, horned, owls, eastern, screech, owls, and, accipiters, the, birds, that, prey, on, pigeons, in, north, america, can, range, in, size, from, american, kestrels, to, golden, eagles, and, may, even, include, crows, gulls, and, ravens, on, the, ground, the, adults, their, young, and, their, eggs, are, at, risk, from, feral, and, domestic, cats, doves, and, pigeons, are, considered, to, be, game, birds, since, many, species, are, hunted, and, used, for, food, in, many, of, the, countries, in, which, they, are, native, the, body, feathers, have, dense, fluffy, bases, and, are, loosely, attached, to, the, skin, hence, they, drop, out, easily, when, a, predator, catches, a, pigeon, large, numbers, of, feathers, come, out, in, the, attacker, s, mouth, and, the, pigeon, may, use, this, temporary, distraction, to, make, an, escape, it, also, tends, to, drop, the, tail, feathers, when, preyed, upon, or, under, traumatic, conditions, probably, as, a, distraction, mechanism, pigeons, may, harbour, a, diverse, parasite, fauna, they, often, host, the, intestinal, helminths, capillaria, columbae, and, ascaridia, columbae, their, ectoparasites, include, the, ischnoceran, lice, columbicola, columbae, campanulotes, bidentatus, compar, the, amblyceran, lice, bonomiella, columbae, hohorstiella, lata, colpocephalum, turbinatum, the, mites, tinaminyssus, melloi, dermanyssus, gallinae, dermoglyphus, columbae, falculifer, rostratus, and, diplaegidia, columbae, the, hippoboscid, fly, pseudolynchia, canariensis, is, a, typical, blood, sucking, ectoparasite, of, pigeons, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, rock, doves, have, been, domesticated, for, several, thousand, years, giving, rise, to, the, domestic, pigeon, columba, livia, domestica, they, may, have, been, domesticated, as, long, as, 5, 000, years, ago, numerous, breeds, of, fancy, pigeons, of, all, sizes, colours, and, types, have, been, bred, domesticated, pigeons, are, used, as, homing, pigeons, as, well, as, food, and, pets, they, were, in, the, past, also, used, as, carrier, pigeons, so, called, war, pigeons, have, played, significant, roles, during, wartime, and, many, pigeons, have, received, awards, and, medals, for, their, services, in, saving, hundreds, of, human, lives, pigeons, have, notably, been, employed, as, medical, imaging, data, sorters, they, have, been, successfully, trained, under, research, conditions, to, examine, data, on, a, screen, for, the, purposes, of, detecting, breast, cancer, they, appear, to, use, their, innate, visual, navigation, skills, to, do, so, many, domestic, birds, have, gotten, lost, escaped, or, been, released, over, the, years, and, have, given, rise, to, feral, pigeons, these, show, a, variety, of, plumages, although, many, have, the, blue, barred, pattern, as, does, the, pure, rock, dove, feral, pigeons, are, found, in, cities, and, towns, all, over, the, world, the, scarcity, of, the, pure, wild, species, is, partly, due, to, interbreeding, with, feral, birds, contact, with, pigeon, droppings, poses, a, minor, risk, of, contracting, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and, psittacosis, and, long, term, exposure, to, both, droppings, and, feathers, can, induce, an, allergy, known, as, bird, fancier, s, lung, pigeons, are, not, a, major, concern, in, the, spread, of, west, nile, virus, though, they, can, contract, it, they, apparently, do, not, transmit, it, some, contagions, are, transmitted, by, pigeons, for, example, the, bacteria, chlamydophila, psittaci, is, endemic, among, pigeons, and, causes, psittacosis, in, humans, it, is, generally, transmitted, from, handling, pigeons, or, their, droppings, more, commonly, the, latter, psittacosis, is, a, serious, disease, but, rarely, fatal, less, than, 1, pigeons, are, also, important, vectors, for, various, species, of, the, bacteria, salmonella, which, causes, diseases, such, as, salmonellosis, and, paratyphoid, fever, pigeons, are, also, known, to, host, avian, mites, which, can, infest, human, habitation, and, bite, humans, a, condition, known, as, gamasoidosis, however, infesting, mammals, is, relatively, rare, pigeons, may, however, carry, and, spread, avian, influenza, one, study, has, shown, that, adult, pigeons, are, not, clinically, susceptible, to, the, most, dangerous, strain, of, avian, influenza, h5n1, and, that, they, do, not, transmit, the, virus, to, poultry, other, studies, have, presented, evidence, of, clinical, signs, and, neurological, lesions, resulting, from, infection, but, found, that, the, pigeons, did, not, transmit, the, disease, to, poultry, reared, in, direct, contact, with, them, pigeons, were, found, to, be, resistant, or, minimally, susceptible, to, other, strains, of, avian, influenza, such, as, the, h7n7, research, into, whether, pigeons, play, a, part, in, spreading, bird, flu, have, shown, pigeons, do, not, carry, the, deadly, h5n1, strain, three, studies, have, been, done, since, the, late, 1990s, by, the, us, agriculture, department, s, southeast, poultry, research, laboratory, in, athens, georgia, according, to, the, center, s, director, david, swayne, the, lab, has, been, working, on, bird, flu, since, the, 1970s, in, one, experiment, researchers, squirted, into, pigeons, mouths, liquid, drops, that, contained, the, highly, pathogenic, h5n1, virus, from, a, hong, kong, sample, the, birds, received, 100, to, 1, 000, times, the, concentration, that, wild, birds, would, encounter, in, nature, we, couldn, t, infect, the, pigeons, swayne, said, so, that, s, good, news
