https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis
symbiosis, ancient, greek, symb, sis, living, with, companionship, s, n, together, and, b, sis, living, is, any, type, of, a, close, and, long, term, biological, interaction, between, two, organisms, of, different, species, the, two, organisms, termed, symbionts, can, be, either, in, a, mutualistic, a, commensalistic, or, a, parasitic, relationship, in, 1879, heinrich, anton, de, bary, defined, symbiosis, as, the, living, together, of, unlike, organisms, the, term, is, sometimes, more, exclusively, used, in, a, restricted, mutualistic, sense, where, both, symbionts, contribute, to, each, other, s, subsistence, symbiosis, can, be, obligatory, which, means, that, one, or, both, of, the, symbionts, depend, on, each, other, for, survival, or, facultative, optional, when, they, can, also, subsist, independently, symbiosis, is, also, classified, by, physical, attachment, symbionts, forming, a, single, body, live, in, conjunctive, symbiosis, while, all, other, arrangements, are, called, disjunctive, symbiosis, when, one, organism, lives, on, the, surface, of, another, such, as, head, lice, on, humans, it, is, called, ectosymbiosis, when, one, partner, lives, inside, the, tissues, of, another, such, as, symbiodinium, within, coral, it, is, termed, endosymbiosis, the, definition, of, symbiosis, was, a, matter, of, debate, for, 130, years, in, 1877, albert, bernhard, frank, used, the, term, symbiosis, to, describe, the, mutualistic, relationship, in, lichens, in, 1878, the, german, mycologist, heinrich, anton, de, bary, defined, it, as, the, living, together, of, unlike, organisms, the, definition, has, varied, among, scientists, with, some, advocating, that, it, should, only, refer, to, persistent, mutualisms, while, others, thought, it, should, apply, to, all, persistent, biological, interactions, in, other, words, to, mutualism, commensalism, and, parasitism, but, excluding, brief, interactions, such, as, predation, in, the, 21st, century, the, latter, has, become, the, definition, widely, accepted, by, biologists, in, 1949, edward, haskell, proposed, an, integrative, approach, with, a, classification, of, co, actions, later, adopted, by, biologists, as, interactions, relationships, can, be, obligate, meaning, that, one, or, both, of, the, symbionts, entirely, depend, on, each, other, for, survival, for, example, in, lichens, which, consist, of, fungal, and, photosynthetic, symbionts, the, fungal, partners, cannot, live, on, their, own, the, algal, or, cyanobacterial, symbionts, in, lichens, such, as, trentepohlia, can, generally, live, independently, and, their, part, of, the, relationship, is, therefore, described, as, facultative, optional, or, non, obligate, when, one, of, the, participants, in, a, symbiotic, relationship, is, capable, of, photosynthesis, as, with, lichens, it, is, called, photosymbiosis, ectosymbiosis, is, any, symbiotic, relationship, in, which, the, symbiont, lives, on, the, body, surface, of, the, host, including, the, inner, surface, of, the, digestive, tract, or, the, ducts, of, exocrine, glands, examples, of, this, include, ectoparasites, such, as, lice, commensal, ectosymbionts, such, as, the, barnacles, which, attach, themselves, to, the, jaw, of, baleen, whales, and, mutualist, ectosymbionts, such, as, cleaner, fish, contrastingly, endosymbiosis, is, any, symbiotic, relationship, in, which, one, symbiont, lives, within, the, tissues, of, the, other, either, within, the, cells, or, extracellularly, examples, include, diverse, microbiomes, rhizobia, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, that, live, in, root, nodules, on, legume, roots, actinomycetes, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, such, as, frankia, which, live, in, alder, root, nodules, single, celled, algae, inside, reef, building, corals, and, bacterial, endosymbionts, that, provide, essential, nutrients, to, about, 10, 15, of, insects, in, endosymbiosis, the, host, cell, lacks, some, of, the, nutrients, which, the, endosymbiont, provides, as, a, result, the, host, favors, endosymbiont, s, growth, processes, within, itself, by, producing, some, specialized, cells, these, cells, affect, the, genetic, composition, of, the, host, in, order, to, regulate, the, increasing, population, of, the, endosymbionts, and, ensure, that, these, genetic, changes, are, passed, onto, the, offspring, via, vertical, transmission, heredity, as, the, endosymbiont, adapts, to, the, host, s, lifestyle, the, endosymbiont, changes, dramatically, there, is, a, drastic, reduction, in, its, genome, size, as, many, genes, are, lost, during, the, process, of, metabolism, and, dna, repair, and, recombination, while, important, genes, participating, in, the, dna, to, rna, transcription, protein, translation, and, dna, rna, replication, are, retained, the, decrease, in, genome, size, is, due, to, loss, of, protein, coding, genes, and, not, due, to, lessening, of, inter, genic, regions, or, open, reading, frame, orf, size, species, that, are, naturally, evolving, and, contain, reduced, sizes, of, genes, can, be, accounted, for, an, increased, number, of, noticeable, differences, between, them, thereby, leading, to, changes, in, their, evolutionary, rates, when, endosymbiotic, bacteria, related, with, insects, are, passed, on, to, the, offspring, strictly, via, vertical, genetic, transmission, intracellular, bacteria, go, across, many, hurdles, during, the, process, resulting, in, the, decrease, in, effective, population, sizes, as, compared, to, the, free, living, bacteria, the, incapability, of, the, endosymbiotic, bacteria, to, reinstate, their, wild, type, phenotype, via, a, recombination, process, is, called, muller, s, ratchet, phenomenon, muller, s, ratchet, phenomenon, together, with, less, effective, population, sizes, leads, to, an, accretion, of, deleterious, mutations, in, the, non, essential, genes, of, the, intracellular, bacteria, this, can, be, due, to, lack, of, selection, mechanisms, prevailing, in, the, relatively, rich, host, environment, competition, can, be, defined, as, an, interaction, between, organisms, or, species, in, which, the, fitness, of, one, is, lowered, by, the, presence, of, another, limited, supply, of, at, least, one, resource, such, as, food, water, and, territory, used, by, both, usually, facilitates, this, type, of, interaction, although, the, competition, can, also, be, for, other, resources, amensalism, is, a, non, symbiotic, asymmetric, interaction, where, one, species, is, harmed, or, killed, by, the, other, and, one, is, unaffected, by, the, other, there, are, two, types, of, amensalism, competition, and, antagonism, or, antibiosis, competition, is, where, a, larger, or, stronger, organism, deprives, a, smaller, or, weaker, one, of, a, resource, antagonism, occurs, when, one, organism, is, damaged, or, killed, by, another, through, a, chemical, secretion, an, example, of, competition, is, a, sapling, growing, under, the, shadow, of, a, mature, tree, the, mature, tree, can, rob, the, sapling, of, necessary, sunlight, and, if, the, mature, tree, is, very, large, it, can, take, up, rainwater, and, deplete, soil, nutrients, throughout, the, process, the, mature, tree, is, unaffected, by, the, sapling, indeed, if, the, sapling, dies, the, mature, tree, gains, nutrients, from, the, decaying, sapling, an, example, of, antagonism, is, juglans, nigra, black, walnut, secreting, juglone, a, substance, which, destroys, many, herbaceous, plants, within, its, root, zone, the, term, amensalism, is, often, used, to, describe, strongly, asymmetrical, competitive, interactions, such, as, between, the, spanish, ibex, and, weevils, of, the, genus, timarcha, which, feed, upon, the, same, type, of, shrub, whilst, the, presence, of, the, weevil, has, almost, no, influence, on, food, availability, the, presence, of, ibex, has, an, enormous, detrimental, effect, on, weevil, numbers, as, they, consume, significant, quantities, of, plant, matter, and, incidentally, ingest, the, weevils, upon, it, commensalism, describes, a, relationship, between, two, living, organisms, where, one, benefits, and, the, other, is, not, significantly, harmed, or, helped, it, is, derived, from, the, english, word, commensal, used, of, human, social, interaction, it, derives, from, a, medieval, latin, word, meaning, sharing, food, formed, from, com, with, and, mensa, table, commensal, relationships, may, involve, one, organism, using, another, for, transportation, phoresy, or, for, housing, inquilinism, or, it, may, also, involve, one, organism, using, something, another, created, after, its, death, metabiosis, examples, of, metabiosis, are, hermit, crabs, using, gastropod, shells, to, protect, their, bodies, and, spiders, building, their, webs, on, plants, mutualism, or, interspecies, reciprocal, altruism, is, a, long, term, relationship, between, individuals, of, different, species, where, both, individuals, benefit, mutualistic, relationships, may, be, either, obligate, for, both, species, obligate, for, one, but, facultative, for, the, other, or, facultative, for, both, many, herbivores, have, mutualistic, gut, flora, to, help, them, digest, plant, matter, which, is, more, difficult, to, digest, than, animal, prey, this, gut, flora, comprises, cellulose, digesting, protozoans, or, bacteria, living, in, the, herbivores, intestines, coral, reefs, result, from, mutualism, between, coral, organisms, and, various, algae, living, inside, them, most, land, plants, and, land, ecosystems, rely, on, mutualism, between, the, plants, which, fix, carbon, from, the, air, and, mycorrhyzal, fungi, which, help, in, extracting, water, and, minerals, from, the, ground, an, example, of, mutualism, is, the, relationship, between, the, ocellaris, clownfish, that, dwell, among, the, tentacles, of, ritteri, sea, anemones, the, territorial, fish, protects, the, anemone, from, anemone, eating, fish, and, in, turn, the, anemone, stinging, tentacles, protect, the, clownfish, from, its, predators, a, special, mucus, on, the, clownfish, protects, it, from, the, stinging, tentacles, a, further, example, is, the, goby, a, fish, which, sometimes, lives, together, with, a, shrimp, the, shrimp, digs, and, cleans, up, a, burrow, in, the, sand, in, which, both, the, shrimp, and, the, goby, fish, live, the, shrimp, is, almost, blind, leaving, it, vulnerable, to, predators, when, outside, its, burrow, in, case, of, danger, the, goby, touches, the, shrimp, with, its, tail, to, warn, it, when, that, happens, both, the, shrimp, and, goby, quickly, retreat, into, the, burrow, different, species, of, gobies, elacatinus, spp, also, clean, up, ectoparasites, in, other, fish, possibly, another, kind, of, mutualism, a, spectacular, example, of, obligate, mutualism, is, the, relationship, between, the, siboglinid, tube, worms, and, symbiotic, bacteria, that, live, at, hydrothermal, vents, and, cold, seeps, the, worm, has, no, digestive, tract, and, is, wholly, reliant, on, its, internal, symbionts, for, nutrition, the, bacteria, oxidize, either, hydrogen, sulfide, or, methane, which, the, host, supplies, to, them, these, worms, were, discovered, in, the, late, 1980s, at, the, hydrothermal, vents, near, the, galapagos, islands, and, have, since, been, found, at, deep, sea, hydrothermal, vents, and, cold, seeps, in, all, of, the, world, s, oceans, mutualism, improves, both, organism, s, competitive, ability, and, will, outcompete, organisms, of, the, same, species, that, lack, the, symbiont, a, facultative, symbiosis, is, seen, in, encrusting, bryozoans, and, hermit, crabs, the, bryozoan, colony, acanthodesia, commensale, develops, a, cirumrotatory, growth, and, offers, the, crab, pseudopagurus, granulimanus, a, helicospiral, tubular, extension, of, its, living, chamber, that, initially, was, situated, within, a, gastropod, shell, in, a, parasitic, relationship, the, parasite, benefits, while, the, host, is, harmed, parasitism, takes, many, forms, from, endoparasites, that, live, within, the, host, s, body, to, ectoparasites, and, parasitic, castrators, that, live, on, its, surface, and, micropredators, like, mosquitoes, that, visit, intermittently, parasitism, is, an, extremely, successful, mode, of, life, about, 40, of, all, animal, species, are, parasites, and, the, average, mammal, species, is, host, to, 4, nematodes, 2, cestodes, and, 2, trematodes, mimicry, is, a, form, of, symbiosis, in, which, a, species, adopts, distinct, characteristics, of, another, species, to, alter, its, relationship, dynamic, with, the, species, being, mimicked, to, its, own, advantage, among, the, many, types, of, mimicry, are, batesian, and, m, llerian, the, first, involving, one, sided, exploitation, the, second, providing, mutual, benefit, batesian, mimicry, is, an, exploitative, three, party, interaction, where, one, species, the, mimic, has, evolved, to, mimic, another, the, model, to, deceive, a, third, the, dupe, in, terms, of, signalling, theory, the, mimic, and, model, have, evolved, to, send, a, signal, the, dupe, has, evolved, to, receive, it, from, the, model, this, is, to, the, advantage, of, the, mimic, but, to, the, detriment, of, both, the, model, whose, protective, signals, are, effectively, weakened, and, of, the, dupe, which, is, deprived, of, an, edible, prey, for, example, a, wasp, is, a, strongly, defended, model, which, signals, with, its, conspicuous, black, and, yellow, coloration, that, it, is, an, unprofitable, prey, to, predators, such, as, birds, which, hunt, by, sight, many, hoverflies, are, batesian, mimics, of, wasps, and, any, bird, that, avoids, these, hoverflies, is, a, dupe, in, contrast, m, llerian, mimicry, is, mutually, beneficial, as, all, participants, are, both, models, and, mimics, for, example, different, species, of, bumblebee, mimic, each, other, with, similar, warning, coloration, in, combinations, of, black, white, red, and, yellow, and, all, of, them, benefit, from, the, relationship, cleaning, symbiosis, is, an, association, between, individuals, of, two, species, where, one, the, cleaner, removes, and, eats, parasites, and, other, materials, from, the, surface, of, the, other, the, client, it, is, putatively, mutually, beneficial, but, biologists, have, long, debated, whether, it, is, mutual, selfishness, or, simply, exploitative, cleaning, symbiosis, is, well, known, among, marine, fish, where, some, small, species, of, cleaner, fish, notably, wrasses, but, also, species, in, other, genera, are, specialized, to, feed, almost, exclusively, by, cleaning, larger, fish, and, other, marine, animals, in, a, supreme, situation, the, host, species, fish, or, marine, life, will, display, itself, at, a, designated, station, deemed, the, cleaning, station, cleaner, fish, play, an, essential, role, in, the, reduction, of, parasitism, on, marine, animals, some, shark, species, participate, in, cleaning, symbiosis, where, cleaner, fish, remove, ectoparasites, from, the, body, of, the, shark, a, study, by, raymond, keyes, addresses, the, atypical, behavior, of, a, few, shark, species, when, exposed, to, cleaner, fish, in, this, experiment, cleaner, wrasse, labroides, dimidiatus, and, various, shark, species, were, placed, in, a, tank, together, and, observed, the, different, shark, species, exhibited, different, responses, and, behaviors, around, the, wrasse, for, example, atlantic, and, pacific, lemon, sharks, consistently, react, to, the, wrasse, fish, in, a, fascinating, way, during, the, interaction, the, shark, remains, passive, and, the, wrasse, swims, to, it, it, begins, to, scan, the, shark, s, body, sometimes, stopping, to, inspect, specific, areas, commonly, the, wrasse, would, inspect, the, gills, labial, regions, and, skin, when, the, wrasse, makes, its, way, to, the, mouth, of, the, shark, the, shark, often, ceases, breathing, for, up, to, two, and, a, half, minutes, so, that, the, fish, is, able, to, scan, the, mouth, then, the, fish, passes, further, into, the, mouth, to, examine, the, gills, specifically, the, buccopharyngeal, area, which, typically, holds, the, most, parasites, when, the, shark, begins, to, close, its, mouth, the, wrasse, finishes, its, examination, and, goes, elsewhere, male, bull, sharks, exhibit, slightly, different, behavior, at, cleaning, stations, as, the, shark, swims, into, a, colony, of, wrasse, fish, it, drastically, slows, its, speed, to, allow, the, cleaners, to, do, their, job, after, approximately, one, minute, the, shark, returns, to, normal, swimming, speed, symbiosis, is, increasingly, recognized, as, an, important, selective, force, behind, evolution, many, species, have, a, long, history, of, interdependent, co, evolution, although, symbiosis, was, once, discounted, as, an, anecdotal, evolutionary, phenomenon, evidence, is, now, overwhelming, that, obligate, or, facultative, associations, among, microorganisms, and, between, microorganisms, and, multicellular, hosts, had, crucial, consequences, in, many, landmark, events, in, evolution, and, in, the, generation, of, phenotypic, diversity, and, complex, phenotypes, able, to, colonise, new, environments, evolution, originated, from, changes, in, development, where, variations, within, species, are, selected, for, or, against, because, of, the, symbionts, involved, the, hologenome, theory, relates, to, the, holobiont, and, symbionts, genome, together, as, a, whole, microbes, live, everywhere, in, and, on, every, multicellular, organism, many, organisms, rely, on, their, symbionts, in, order, to, develop, properly, this, is, known, as, co, development, in, cases, of, co, development, the, symbionts, send, signals, to, their, host, which, determine, developmental, processes, co, development, is, commonly, seen, in, both, arthropods, and, vertebrates, one, hypothesis, for, the, origin, of, the, nucleus, in, eukaryotes, plants, animals, fungi, and, protists, is, that, it, developed, from, a, symbiogenesis, between, bacteria, and, archaea, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, symbiosis, originated, when, ancient, archaea, similar, to, modern, methanogenic, archaea, invaded, and, lived, within, bacteria, similar, to, modern, myxobacteria, eventually, forming, the, early, nucleus, this, theory, is, analogous, to, the, accepted, theory, for, the, origin, of, eukaryotic, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, which, are, thought, to, have, developed, from, a, similar, endosymbiotic, relationship, between, proto, eukaryotes, and, aerobic, bacteria, evidence, for, this, includes, the, fact, that, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, divide, independently, of, the, cell, and, that, these, organelles, have, their, own, genome, the, biologist, lynn, margulis, famous, for, her, work, on, endosymbiosis, contended, that, symbiosis, is, a, major, driving, force, behind, evolution, she, considered, darwin, s, notion, of, evolution, driven, by, competition, to, be, incomplete, and, claimed, that, evolution, is, strongly, based, on, co, operation, interaction, and, mutual, dependence, among, organisms, according, to, margulis, and, her, son, dorion, sagan, life, did, not, take, over, the, globe, by, combat, but, by, networking, about, 80, of, vascular, plants, worldwide, form, symbiotic, relationships, with, fungi, in, particular, in, arbuscular, mycorrhizas, flowering, plants, and, the, animals, that, pollinate, them, have, co, evolved, many, plants, that, are, pollinated, by, insects, in, entomophily, bats, or, birds, in, ornithophily, have, highly, specialized, flowers, modified, to, promote, pollination, by, a, specific, pollinator, that, is, correspondingly, adapted, the, first, flowering, plants, in, the, fossil, record, had, relatively, simple, flowers, adaptive, speciation, quickly, gave, rise, to, many, diverse, groups, of, plants, and, at, the, same, time, corresponding, speciation, occurred, in, certain, insect, groups, some, groups, of, plants, developed, nectar, and, large, sticky, pollen, while, insects, evolved, more, specialized, morphologies, to, access, and, collect, these, rich, food, sources, in, some, taxa, of, plants, and, insects, the, relationship, has, become, dependent, where, the, plant, species, can, only, be, pollinated, by, one, species, of, insect, the, acacia, ant, pseudomyrmex, ferruginea, is, an, obligate, plant, ant, that, protects, at, least, five, species, of, acacia, vachellia, from, preying, insects, and, from, other, plants, competing, for, sunlight, and, the, tree, provides, nourishment, and, shelter, for, the, ant, and, its, larvae, seed, dispersal, is, the, movement, spread, or, transport, of, seeds, away, from, the, parent, plant, plants, have, limited, mobility, and, rely, upon, a, variety, of, dispersal, vectors, to, transport, their, propagules, including, both, abiotic, vectors, such, as, the, wind, and, living, biotic, vectors, like, birds, in, order, to, attract, animals, these, plants, evolved, a, set, of, morphological, characters, such, as, fruit, colour, mass, and, persistence, correlated, to, particular, seed, dispersal, agents, for, example, plants, may, evolve, conspicuous, fruit, colours, to, attract, avian, frugivores, and, birds, may, learn, to, associate, such, colours, with, a, food, resource
