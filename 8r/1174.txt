amorphea, including, fungi, and, animals, apusomonadida, archaeplastida, including, land, plants, breviatea, crums, cryptista, discoba, haptista, hemimastigophora, malawimonadida, metamonada, provora, sar, supergroup, telonemia, animalia, fungi, embryophyta, land, plants, a, protist, p, r, o, t, s, t, proh, tist, or, protoctist, is, any, eukaryotic, organism, that, is, not, an, animal, land, plant, or, fungus, protists, do, not, form, a, natural, group, or, clade, but, are, a, polyphyletic, grouping, of, several, independent, clades, that, evolved, from, the, last, eukaryotic, common, ancestor, protists, were, historically, regarded, as, a, separate, taxonomic, kingdom, known, as, protista, or, protoctista, with, the, advent, of, phylogenetic, analysis, and, electron, microscopy, studies, the, use, of, protista, as, a, formal, taxon, was, gradually, abandoned, in, modern, classifications, protists, are, spread, across, several, eukaryotic, clades, called, supergroups, such, as, archaeplastida, photoautotrophs, that, includes, land, plants, sar, obazoa, which, includes, fungi, and, animals, amoebozoa, and, excavata, protists, represent, an, extremely, large, genetic, and, ecological, diversity, in, all, environments, including, extreme, habitats, their, diversity, larger, than, for, all, other, eukaryotes, has, only, been, discovered, in, recent, decades, through, the, study, of, environmental, dna, and, is, still, in, the, process, of, being, fully, described, they, are, present, in, all, ecosystems, as, important, components, of, the, biogeochemical, cycles, and, trophic, webs, they, exist, abundantly, and, ubiquitously, in, a, variety, of, forms, that, evolved, multiple, times, independently, such, as, free, living, algae, amoebae, and, slime, moulds, or, as, important, parasites, together, they, compose, an, amount, of, biomass, that, doubles, that, of, animals, they, exhibit, varied, types, of, nutrition, such, as, phototrophy, phagotrophy, or, osmotrophy, sometimes, combining, them, in, mixotrophy, they, present, unique, adaptations, not, present, in, multicellular, animals, fungi, or, land, plants, the, study, of, protists, is, termed, protistology, there, is, not, a, single, accepted, definition, of, what, protists, are, as, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, of, diverse, biological, groups, they, have, historically, been, regarded, as, a, catch, all, taxon, that, includes, any, eukaryotic, organism, i, e, living, beings, whose, cells, possess, a, nucleus, that, is, not, an, animal, a, land, plant, or, a, dikaryon, fungus, because, of, this, definition, by, exclusion, protists, encompass, almost, all, of, the, broad, spectrum, of, biological, characteristics, expected, in, eukaryotes, they, are, generally, unicellular, microscopic, eukaryotes, some, species, can, be, purely, phototrophic, generally, called, algae, or, purely, heterotrophic, traditionally, called, protozoa, but, there, is, a, wide, range, of, mixotrophic, protists, which, exhibit, both, phagotrophy, and, phototrophy, together, they, have, different, life, cycles, trophic, levels, modes, of, locomotion, and, cellular, structures, some, protists, can, be, pathogens, examples, of, basic, protist, forms, that, do, not, represent, evolutionary, cohesive, lineages, include, the, names, of, some, protists, called, ambiregnal, protists, because, of, their, mixture, of, traits, similar, to, both, animals, and, plants, or, fungi, e, g, slime, molds, and, flagellated, algae, like, euglenids, have, been, published, under, either, or, both, of, the, icn, and, the, iczn, codes, the, evolutionary, relationships, of, protists, have, been, explained, through, molecular, phylogenetics, the, sequencing, of, entire, genomes, and, transcriptomes, and, electron, microscopy, studies, of, the, flagellar, apparatus, and, cytoskeleton, new, major, lineages, of, protists, and, novel, biodiversity, continue, to, be, discovered, resulting, in, dramatic, changes, to, the, eukaryotic, tree, of, life, the, newest, classification, systems, of, eukaryotes, revised, in, 2019, do, not, recognize, the, formal, taxonomic, ranks, kingdom, phylum, class, order, and, instead, only, recognize, clades, of, related, organisms, making, the, classification, more, stable, in, the, long, term, and, easier, to, update, in, this, new, cladistic, scheme, the, protists, are, divided, into, various, wide, branches, informally, named, supergroups, many, smaller, lineages, do, not, belong, to, any, of, these, supergroups, and, are, usually, poorly, known, groups, with, limited, data, often, referred, to, as, orphan, groups, some, such, as, the, crums, clade, malawimonadida, and, ancyromonadida, appear, to, be, related, to, amorphea, others, like, hemimastigophora, 10, species, and, provora, 7, species, appear, to, be, related, to, or, within, diaphoretickes, a, clade, that, unites, sar, archaeplastida, haptista, and, cryptista, although, the, root, of, the, tree, is, still, unresolved, one, possible, topology, of, the, eukaryotic, tree, of, life, is, stramenopiles, alveolata, rhizaria, telonemia, haptista, provora, hemimastigophora, cryptista, archaeplastida, discoba, metamonada, ancyromonadida, malawimonadida, crums, amoebozoa, breviatea, apusomonadida, opisthokonta, from, the, start, of, the, 18th, century, the, popular, term, infusion, animals, later, infusoria, referred, to, protists, bacteria, and, small, invertebrate, animals, in, the, mid, 18th, century, while, swedish, scientist, carl, von, linnaeus, largely, ignored, the, protists, his, danish, contemporary, otto, friedrich, m, ller, was, the, first, to, introduce, protists, to, the, binomial, nomenclature, system, in, the, early, 19th, century, german, naturalist, georg, august, goldfuss, introduced, protozoa, meaning, early, animals, as, a, class, within, kingdom, animalia, to, refer, to, four, very, different, groups, infusoria, ciliates, corals, phytozoa, such, as, cryptomonas, and, jellyfish, later, in, 1845, carl, theodor, von, siebold, was, the, first, to, establish, protozoa, as, a, phylum, of, exclusively, unicellular, animals, consisting, of, two, classes, infusoria, ciliates, and, rhizopoda, amoebae, foraminifera, other, scientists, did, not, consider, all, of, them, part, of, the, animal, kingdom, and, by, the, middle, of, the, century, they, were, regarded, within, the, groupings, of, protozoa, early, animals, protophyta, early, plants, phytozoa, animal, like, plants, and, bacteria, mostly, considered, plants, microscopic, organisms, were, increasingly, constrained, in, the, plant, animal, dichotomy, in, 1858, the, palaeontolgist, richard, owen, was, the, first, to, define, protozoa, as, a, separate, kingdom, of, eukaryotic, organisms, with, nucleated, cells, and, the, common, organic, characters, of, plants, and, animals, although, he, also, included, sponges, within, protozoa, in, 1860, british, naturalist, john, hogg, proposed, protoctista, meaning, first, created, beings, as, the, name, for, a, fourth, kingdom, of, nature, the, other, kingdoms, being, linnaeus, plant, animal, and, mineral, which, comprised, all, the, lower, primitive, organisms, including, protophyta, protozoa, and, sponges, at, the, merging, bases, of, the, plant, and, animal, kingdoms, in, 1866, the, father, of, protistology, german, scientist, ernst, haeckel, addressed, the, problem, of, classifying, all, these, organisms, as, a, mixture, of, animal, and, vegetable, characters, and, proposed, protistenreich, kingdom, protista, as, the, third, kingdom, of, life, comprising, primitive, forms, that, were, neither, animals, nor, plants, he, grouped, both, bacteria, and, eukaryotes, both, unicellular, and, multicellular, organisms, as, protista, he, retained, the, infusoria, in, the, animal, kingdom, until, german, zoologist, otto, butschli, demonstrated, that, they, were, unicellular, at, first, he, included, sponges, and, fungi, but, in, later, publications, he, explicitly, restricted, protista, to, predominantly, unicellular, organisms, or, colonies, incapable, of, forming, tissues, he, clearly, separated, protista, from, true, animals, on, the, basis, that, the, defining, character, of, protists, was, the, absence, of, sexual, reproduction, while, the, defining, character, of, animals, was, the, blastula, stage, of, animal, development, he, also, returned, the, terms, protozoa, and, protophyta, as, subkingdoms, of, protista, butschli, considered, the, kingdom, to, be, too, polyphyletic, and, rejected, the, inclusion, of, bacteria, he, fragmented, the, kingdom, into, protozoa, only, nucleated, unicellular, animal, like, organisms, while, bacteria, and, the, protophyta, were, a, separate, grouping, this, strengthened, the, old, dichotomy, of, protozoa, protophyta, from, german, scientist, carl, theodor, von, siebold, and, the, german, naturalists, asserted, this, view, over, the, worldwide, scientific, community, by, the, turn, of, the, century, however, british, biologist, c, clifford, dobell, in, 1911, brought, attention, to, the, fact, that, protists, functioned, very, differently, compared, to, the, animal, and, vegetable, cellular, organization, and, gave, importance, to, protista, as, a, group, with, a, different, organization, that, he, called, acellularity, shifting, away, from, the, dogma, of, german, cell, theory, he, coined, the, term, protistology, and, solidified, it, as, a, branch, of, study, independent, from, zoology, and, botany, in, 1938, american, biologist, herbert, copeland, resurrected, hogg, s, label, arguing, that, haeckel, s, term, protista, included, anucleated, microbes, such, as, bacteria, which, the, term, protoctista, meaning, first, established, beings, did, not, under, his, four, kingdom, classification, monera, protoctista, plantae, animalia, the, protists, and, bacteria, were, finally, split, apart, recognizing, the, difference, between, anucleate, prokaryotic, and, nucleate, eukaryotic, organisms, to, firmly, separate, protists, from, plants, he, followed, haeckel, s, blastular, definition, of, true, animals, and, proposed, defining, true, plants, as, those, with, chlorophyll, a, and, b, carotene, xanthophyll, and, production, of, starch, he, also, was, the, first, to, recognize, that, the, unicellular, multicellular, dichotomy, was, invalid, still, he, kept, fungi, within, protoctista, together, with, red, algae, brown, algae, and, protozoans, this, classification, was, the, basis, for, whittaker, s, later, definition, of, fungi, animalia, plantae, and, protista, as, the, four, kingdoms, of, life, in, the, popular, five, kingdom, scheme, published, by, american, plant, ecologist, robert, whittaker, in, 1969, protista, was, defined, as, eukaryotic, organisms, which, are, unicellular, or, unicellular, colonial, and, which, form, no, tissues, just, as, the, prokaryotic, eukaryotic, division, was, becoming, mainstream, whittaker, after, a, decade, from, copeland, s, system, recognized, the, fundamental, division, of, life, between, the, prokaryotic, monera, and, the, eukaryotic, kingdoms, animalia, ingestion, plantae, photosynthesis, fungi, absorption, and, the, remaining, protista, in, the, five, kingdom, system, of, american, evolutionary, biologist, lynn, margulis, the, term, protist, was, reserved, for, microscopic, organisms, while, the, more, inclusive, kingdom, protoctista, or, protoctists, included, certain, large, multicellular, eukaryotes, such, as, kelp, red, algae, and, slime, molds, some, use, the, term, protist, interchangeably, with, margulis, protoctist, to, encompass, both, single, celled, and, multicellular, eukaryotes, including, those, that, form, specialized, tissues, but, do, not, fit, into, any, of, the, other, traditional, kingdoms, the, five, kingdom, model, remained, the, accepted, classification, until, the, development, of, molecular, phylogenetics, in, the, late, 20th, century, when, it, became, apparent, that, protists, are, a, paraphyletic, group, from, which, animals, fungi, and, plants, evolved, and, the, three, domain, system, bacteria, archaea, eukarya, became, prevalent, today, protists, are, not, treated, as, a, formal, taxon, but, the, term, is, commonly, used, for, convenience, in, two, ways, there, is, however, one, classification, of, protists, based, on, traditional, ranks, that, lasted, until, the, 21st, century, the, british, protozoologist, thomas, cavalier, smith, since, 1998, developed, a, six, kingdom, model, bacteria, animalia, plantae, fungi, protozoa, and, chromista, in, his, context, paraphyletic, groups, take, preference, over, clades, both, protist, kingdoms, protozoa, and, chromista, contain, paraphyletic, phyla, such, as, apusozoa, eolouka, or, opisthosporidia, additionally, red, and, green, algae, are, considered, true, plants, while, the, fungal, groups, microsporidia, rozellida, and, aphelida, are, considered, protozoans, under, the, phylum, opisthosporidia, this, scheme, endured, until, 2021, the, year, of, his, last, publication, according, to, molecular, data, protists, dominate, eukaryotic, diversity, accounting, for, a, vast, majority, of, environmental, dna, sequences, or, operational, taxonomic, units, otus, however, their, species, diversity, is, severely, underestimated, by, traditional, methods, that, differentiate, species, based, on, morphological, characteristics, the, number, of, described, protistan, species, is, very, low, ranging, from, 26, 000, to, 74, 400, as, of, 2012, in, comparison, to, the, diversity, of, plants, animals, and, fungi, which, are, historically, and, biologically, well, known, and, studied, the, predicted, number, of, species, also, varies, greatly, ranging, from, 1, 4, 10, 5, to, 1, 6, 10, 6, and, in, several, groups, the, number, of, predicted, species, is, arbitrarily, doubled, most, of, these, predictions, are, highly, subjective, molecular, techniques, such, as, dna, barcoding, are, being, used, to, compensate, for, the, lack, of, morphological, diagnoses, but, this, has, revealed, an, unknown, vast, diversity, of, protists, that, is, difficult, to, accurately, process, because, of, the, exceedingly, large, genetic, divergence, between, the, different, protistan, groups, several, different, molecular, markers, need, to, be, used, to, survey, the, vast, protistan, diversity, because, there, is, no, universal, marker, that, can, be, applied, to, all, lineages, protists, make, up, a, large, portion, of, the, biomass, in, both, marine, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, it, has, been, estimated, that, protists, account, for, 4, gigatons, gt, of, biomass, in, the, entire, planet, earth, this, amount, is, smaller, than, 1, of, all, biomass, but, is, still, double, the, amount, estimated, for, all, animals, 2, gt, together, protists, animals, archaea, 7, gt, and, fungi, 12, gt, account, for, less, than, 10, of, the, total, biomass, of, the, planet, because, plants, 450, gt, and, bacteria, 70, gt, are, the, remaining, 80, and, 15, respectively, protists, are, highly, abundant, and, diverse, in, all, types, of, ecosystems, especially, free, living, i, e, non, parasitic, groups, an, unexpectedly, enormous, taxonomically, undescribed, diversity, of, eukaryotic, microbes, is, detected, everywhere, in, the, form, of, environmental, dna, or, rna, the, richest, protist, communities, appear, in, soil, followed, by, ocean, and, freshwater, habitats, phagotrophic, protists, consumers, are, the, most, diverse, functional, group, in, all, ecosystems, with, three, main, taxonomical, groups, of, phagotrophs, rhizaria, mainly, cercozoa, in, freshwater, and, soil, habitats, and, radiolaria, in, oceans, ciliates, most, abundant, in, freshwater, and, second, most, abundant, in, soil, and, non, photosynthetic, stramenopiles, third, most, represented, overall, higher, in, soil, than, in, oceans, phototrophic, protists, producers, appear, in, lower, proportions, probably, constrained, by, intense, predation, they, exist, in, similar, abundance, in, both, oceans, and, soil, they, are, mostly, dinophytes, in, oceans, chrysophytes, in, freshwater, and, archaeplastida, in, soil, marine, protists, are, highly, diverse, have, a, fundamental, impact, on, biogeochemical, cycles, particularly, the, carbon, cycle, and, are, at, the, base, of, the, marine, trophic, networks, as, part, of, the, plankton, phototrophic, marine, protists, located, in, the, photic, zone, as, phytoplankton, are, vital, primary, producers, in, the, oceanic, systems, they, fix, as, much, carbon, as, all, terrestrial, plants, together, the, smallest, fractions, the, picoplankton, 2, m, and, nanoplankton, 2, 20, m, are, dominated, by, several, different, algae, prymnesiophytes, pelagophytes, prasinophytes, fractions, larger, than, 5, m, are, instead, dominated, by, diatoms, and, dinoflagellates, the, heterotrophic, fraction, of, marine, picoplankton, encompasses, primarily, early, branching, stramenopiles, e, g, bicosoecids, and, labyrinthulomycetes, as, well, as, alveolates, ciliates, and, radiolarians, protists, of, lower, frequency, include, cercozoans, and, cryptophytes, mixotrophic, marine, protists, while, not, very, researched, are, present, abundantly, and, ubiquitously, in, the, global, oceans, on, a, wide, range, of, marine, habitats, in, metabarcoding, analyses, they, constitute, more, than, 12, of, the, environmental, sequences, they, are, an, important, and, underestimated, source, of, carbon, in, eutrophic, and, oligotrophic, habitats, their, abundance, varies, seasonally, planktonic, protists, are, classified, into, various, functional, groups, or, mixotypes, that, present, different, biogeographies, freshwater, planktonic, protist, communities, are, characterized, by, a, higher, beta, diversity, i, e, highly, heterogeneous, between, samples, than, soil, and, marine, plankton, the, high, diversity, can, be, a, result, of, the, hydrological, dynamic, of, recruiting, organisms, from, different, habitats, through, extreme, floods, the, main, freshwater, producers, chrysophytes, cryptophytes, and, dinophytes, behave, alternatively, as, consumers, mixotrophs, at, the, same, time, strict, consumers, non, photosynthetic, are, less, abundant, in, freshwater, implying, that, the, consumer, role, is, partly, taken, by, these, mixotrophs, soil, protist, communities, are, ecologically, the, richest, this, may, be, due, to, the, complex, and, highly, dynamic, distribution, of, water, in, the, sediment, which, creates, extremely, heterogenous, environmental, conditions, the, constantly, changing, environment, promotes, the, activity, of, only, one, part, of, the, community, at, a, time, while, the, rest, remains, inactive, this, phenomenon, promotes, high, microbial, diversity, in, prokaryotes, as, well, as, protists, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, detected, diversity, of, soil, dwelling, protists, has, been, described, 8, 1, as, of, 2017, soil, protists, are, also, morphologically, and, functionally, diverse, with, four, major, categories, parasitic, protists, represent, around, 15, 20, of, all, environmental, dna, in, marine, and, soil, systems, but, only, around, 5, in, freshwater, systems, where, chytrid, fungi, likely, fill, that, ecological, niche, in, oceanic, systems, parasitoids, i, e, those, which, kill, their, hosts, e, g, syndiniales, are, more, abundant, in, soil, ecosystems, true, parasites, i, e, those, which, do, not, kill, their, hosts, are, primarily, animal, hosted, apicomplexa, alveolata, and, plant, hosted, oomycetes, stramenopiles, and, plasmodiophorids, rhizaria, in, freshwater, ecosystems, parasitoids, are, mainly, perkinsea, and, syndiniales, alveolata, as, well, as, the, fungal, chytridiomycota, true, parasites, in, freshwater, are, mostly, oomycetes, apicomplexa, and, ichthyosporea, some, protists, are, significant, parasites, of, animals, e, g, five, species, of, the, parasitic, genus, plasmodium, cause, malaria, in, humans, and, many, others, cause, similar, diseases, in, other, vertebrates, plants, the, oomycete, phytophthora, infestans, causes, late, blight, in, potatoes, or, even, of, other, protists, around, 100, protist, species, can, infect, humans, two, papers, from, 2013, have, proposed, virotherapy, the, use, of, viruses, to, treat, infections, caused, by, protozoa, researchers, from, the, agricultural, research, service, are, taking, advantage, of, protists, as, pathogens, to, control, red, imported, fire, ant, solenopsis, invicta, populations, in, argentina, spore, producing, protists, such, as, kneallhazia, solenopsae, recognized, as, a, sister, clade, or, the, closest, relative, to, the, fungus, kingdom, now, can, reduce, red, fire, ant, populations, by, 53, 100, researchers, have, also, been, able, to, infect, phorid, fly, parasitoids, of, the, ant, with, the, protist, without, harming, the, flies, this, turns, the, flies, into, a, vector, that, can, spread, the, pathogenic, protist, between, red, fire, ant, colonies, while, in, general, protists, are, typical, eukaryotic, cells, and, follow, the, same, principles, of, physiology, and, biochemistry, described, for, those, cells, within, the, higher, eukaryotes, animals, fungi, or, plants, they, have, evolved, a, variety, of, unique, physiological, adaptations, that, do, not, appear, in, those, eukaryotes, protists, generally, reproduce, asexually, under, favorable, environmental, conditions, but, tend, to, reproduce, sexually, under, stressful, conditions, such, as, starvation, or, heat, shock, oxidative, stress, which, leads, to, dna, damage, also, appears, to, be, an, important, factor, in, the, induction, of, sex, in, protists, eukaryotes, emerged, in, evolution, more, than, 1, 5, billion, years, ago, the, earliest, eukaryotes, were, protists, although, sexual, reproduction, is, widespread, among, multicellular, eukaryotes, it, seemed, unlikely, until, recently, that, sex, could, be, a, primordial, and, fundamental, characteristic, of, eukaryotes, the, main, reason, for, this, view, was, that, sex, appeared, to, be, lacking, in, certain, pathogenic, protists, whose, ancestors, branched, off, early, from, the, eukaryotic, family, tree, however, several, of, these, early, branching, protists, that, were, thought, to, predate, the, emergence, of, meiosis, and, sex, such, as, giardia, lamblia, and, trichomonas, vaginalis, are, now, known, to, descend, from, ancestors, capable, of, meiosis, and, meiotic, recombination, because, they, have, a, set, core, of, meiotic, genes, that, are, present, in, sexual, eukaryotes, most, of, these, meiotic, genes, were, likely, present, in, the, common, ancestor, of, all, eukaryotes, which, was, likely, capable, of, facultative, non, obligate, sexual, reproduction, this, view, was, further, supported, by, a, 2011, study, on, amoebae, amoebae, have, been, regarded, as, asexual, organisms, but, the, study, describes, evidence, that, most, amoeboid, lineages, are, ancestrally, sexual, and, that, the, majority, of, asexual, groups, likely, arose, recently, and, independently, even, in, the, early, 20th, century, some, researchers, interpreted, phenomena, related, to, chromidia, chromatin, granules, free, in, the, cytoplasm, in, amoebae, as, sexual, reproduction, some, commonly, found, protist, pathogens, such, as, toxoplasma, gondii, are, capable, of, infecting, and, undergoing, asexual, reproduction, in, a, wide, variety, of, animals, which, act, as, secondary, or, intermediate, host, but, can, undergo, sexual, reproduction, only, in, the, primary, or, definitive, host, for, example, felids, such, as, domestic, cats, in, this, case, some, species, for, example, plasmodium, falciparum, have, extremely, complex, life, cycles, that, involve, multiple, forms, of, the, organism, some, of, which, reproduce, sexually, and, others, asexually, however, it, is, unclear, how, frequently, sexual, reproduction, causes, genetic, exchange, between, different, strains, of, plasmodium, in, nature, and, most, populations, of, parasitic, protists, may, be, clonal, lines, that, rarely, exchange, genes, with, other, members, of, their, species, the, pathogenic, parasitic, protists, of, the, genus, leishmania, have, been, shown, to, be, capable, of, a, sexual, cycle, in, the, invertebrate, vector, likened, to, the, meiosis, undertaken, in, the, trypanosomes, by, definition, all, eukaryotes, before, the, existence, of, plants, animals, and, fungi, are, considered, protists, for, that, reason, this, section, contains, information, about, the, deep, ancestry, of, all, eukaryotes, all, living, eukaryotes, including, protists, evolved, from, the, last, eukaryotic, common, ancestor, leca, descendants, of, this, ancestor, are, known, as, crown, group, or, modern, eukaryotes, molecular, clocks, suggest, that, leca, originated, between, 1200, and, more, than, 1800, million, years, ago, ma, based, on, all, molecular, predictions, modern, eukaryotes, reached, morphological, and, ecological, diversity, before, 1000, ma, in, the, form, of, multicellular, algae, capable, of, sexual, reproduction, and, unicellular, protists, capable, of, phagocytosis, and, locomotion, however, the, fossil, record, of, modern, eukaryotes, is, very, scarce, around, this, period, which, contradicts, the, predicted, diversity, instead, the, fossil, record, of, this, period, contains, stem, group, eukaryotes, these, fossils, cannot, be, assigned, to, any, known, crown, group, so, they, probably, belong, to, extinct, lineages, that, originated, before, leca, they, appear, continuously, throughout, the, mesoproterozoic, fossil, record, 1650, 1000, ma, they, present, defining, eukaryote, characteristics, such, as, complex, cell, wall, ornamentation, and, cell, membrane, protrusions, which, require, a, flexible, endomembrane, system, however, they, had, a, major, distinction, from, crown, eukaryores, the, composition, of, their, cell, membrane, unlike, crown, eukaryotes, which, produce, crown, sterols, for, their, cell, membranes, e, g, cholesterol, and, ergosterol, stem, eukaryotes, produced, protosterols, which, appear, earlier, in, the, biosynthetic, pathway, crown, sterols, while, metabolically, more, expensive, may, have, granted, several, evolutionary, advantages, for, leca, s, descendants, specific, unsaturation, patterns, in, crown, sterols, protect, against, osmotic, shock, during, desiccation, and, rehydration, cycles, crown, sterols, can, also, receive, ethyl, groups, thus, enhancing, cohesion, between, lipids, and, adapting, cells, against, extreme, cold, and, heat, moreover, the, additional, steps, in, the, biosynthetic, pathway, allow, cells, to, regulate, the, proportion, of, different, sterols, in, their, membranes, in, turn, allowing, for, a, wider, habitable, temperature, range, and, unique, mechanisms, such, as, asymmetric, cell, division, or, membrane, repair, under, exposure, to, uv, light, a, more, speculative, role, of, these, sterols, is, their, protection, against, the, proterozoic, changing, oxygen, levels, it, is, theorized, that, all, of, these, sterol, based, mechanisms, allowed, leca, s, descendants, to, live, as, extremophiles, of, their, time, diversifying, into, ecological, niches, that, experienced, cycles, of, desiccation, and, rehydration, daily, extremes, of, high, and, low, temperatures, and, elevated, uv, radiation, such, as, mudflats, rivers, agitated, shorelines, and, subaerial, soil, in, contrast, the, named, mechanisms, were, absent, in, stem, group, eukaryotes, as, they, were, only, capable, of, producing, protosterols, instead, these, protosterol, based, life, forms, occupied, open, marine, waters, they, were, facultative, anaerobes, that, thrived, in, mesoproterozoic, waters, which, at, the, time, were, low, on, oxygen, eventually, during, the, tonian, period, neoproterozoic, era, oxygen, levels, increased, and, the, crown, eukaryotes, were, able, to, expand, to, open, marine, environments, thanks, to, their, preference, for, more, oxygenated, habitats, stem, eukaryotes, may, have, been, driven, to, extinction, as, a, result, of, this, competition, additionally, their, protosterol, membranes, may, have, posed, a, disadvantage, during, the, cold, of, the, cryogenian, snowball, earth, glaciations, and, the, extreme, global, heat, that, came, afterwards, modern, eukaryotes, began, to, appear, abundantly, in, the, tonian, period, 1000, 720, ma, fueled, by, the, proliferation, of, red, algae, the, oldest, fossils, assigned, to, modern, eukaryotes, belong, to, two, photosynthetic, protists, the, multicellular, red, alga, bangiomorpha, from, 1050, ma, and, the, chlorophyte, green, alga, proterocladus, from, 1000, ma, abundant, fossils, of, heterotrophic, protists, appear, later, around, 900, ma, with, the, emergence, of, fungi, for, example, the, oldest, fossils, of, amoebozoa, are, vase, shaped, microfossils, resembling, modern, testate, amoebae, found, in, 800, million, year, old, rocks, radiolarian, shells, are, found, abundantly, in, the, fossil, record, after, the, cambrian, period, 500, ma, but, more, recent, paleontological, studies, are, beginning, to, interpret, some, precambrian, fossils, as, the, earliest, evidence, of, radiolarians
