an, affinity, for, public, works, but, this, roman, practice, spread, their, culture, to, places, where, there, may, have, been, more, resistance, to, foreign, mores, unusually, for, the, time, the, thermae, were, not, class, stratified, being, available, to, all, for, no, charge, or, a, small, fee, with, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, aqueduct, system, fell, into, disrepair, and,

steam, the, entrances, to, these, bath, houses, were, very, small, possibly, to, slow, the, escape, of, the, heat, and, steam, there, were, no, windows, so, it, was, very, dark, inside, and, the, user, constantly, coughed, or, cleared, their, throats, in, order, to, signal, to, new, entrants, which, seats, were, already, occupied, the, darkness, could, be, also, used, to, cover, sexual,

ground, with, which, he, later, gives, them, a, massage, then, the, bathers, scrub, themselves, with, a, small, flat, river, stone, and, finally, the, person, in, charge, introduces, buckets, with, water, with, soap, and, grass, used, to, rinse, this, bath, had, also, ritual, importance, and, was, vinculated, to, the, goddess, toci, it, is, also, therapeutic, when, medicinal, herbs, are, used, in, the, water, for, the, tlasas, it, is, still, used, in, mexico, christianity, has, always, placed, a, strong, emphasis, on, hygiene, despite, the, denunciation, of, the, mixed, bathing, style, of, roman, pools, by, early, christian, clergy, as, well, as, the, pagan, custom, of, women, bathing, naked, in, front, of, men, this, did, not, stop, the, church, from, urging, its, followers, to, go, to, public, baths, for, bathing, which, contributed, to, hygiene, and, good, health, according, to, the, church, fathers, clement, of, alexandria, and, tertullian, the, church, also, built, public,

status, clothes, made, the, man, or, woman, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, popularity, of, public, bathhouses, in, europe, sharply, declined, perhaps, due, to, the, new, plague, of, syphilis,

bathing, or, steaming, would, open, pores, to, disease, public, opinion, about, bathing, began, to, shift, in, the, middle, and, late, 18th, century, when, writers, argued, that, frequent, bathing, might, lead, to, better, health, two, english, works, on, the, medical, uses, of, water, were, published, in, the, 18th, century, that, inaugurated, the, new, fashion, for, therapeutic, bathing, one, of, these, was, by, sir, john, floyer, a, physician, of, lichfield, who, struck, by, the, remedial, use, of, certain, springs, by, the, neighbouring, peasantry, investigated, the, history, of, cold, bathing, and, published, a, book, on, the, subject, in, 1702, the, book, ran, through, six, editions, within, a, few, years, and, the, translation, of, this, book, into, german, was, largely, drawn, upon, by, dr, j, s, hahn, of, silesia, as, the, basis, for, his, book, called, on, the, healing, virtues, of, cold, water, inwardly, and, outwardly, applied, as, proved, by, experience, published, in, 1738, the, other, work, was, a, 1797, publication, by, dr, james, currie, of, liverpool, on, the, use, of, hot, and, cold, water, in, the, treatment, of, fever, and, other, illness, with, a, fourth, edition, published, not, long, before, his, death, in, 1805, it, was, also, translated, into, german, by, michaelis, 1801, and, hegewisch, 1807, it, was, highly, popular, and, first, placed, the,

establishment, of, a, soap, manufactory, at, tipton, by, james, keir, and, the, marketing, of, high, quality, transparent, soap, in, 1789, by, andrew, pears, of, london, it, was, in, the, mid, 19th, century, though, that, the, large, scale, consumption, of, soap, by, the, middle, classes, anxious, to, prove, their, social, standing, drove, forward, the, mass, production, and, marketing, of, soap,

ritual, ablutions, but, also, provided, for, general, hygiene, in, an, era, before, private, plumbing, and, served, other, social, functions, such, as, offering, a, gendered, meeting, place, for, men, and, for, women, archeological, remains, attest, to, the, existence, of, bathhouses, in, the, islamic, world, as, early, as, the, umayyad, period, 7th, 8th, centuries, and, their, importance, has,

bath, of, its, type, to, be, built, in, mainland, britain, since, roman, times, was, opened, in, manchester, and, the, idea, spread, rapidly, it, reached, london, in, july, 1860, when, roger, evans, a, member, of, one, of, urquhart, s, foreign, affairs, committees, opened, a, turkish, bath, at, 5, bell, street, near, marble, arch, during, the, following, 150, years, over, 700, turkish, baths,
