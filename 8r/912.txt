ginkgo, biloba, commonly, known, as, ginkgo, or, gingko, k, o, k, o, gink, oh, goh, also, known, as, the, maidenhair, tree, is, a, species, of, gymnosperm, tree, native, to, east, asia, it, is, the, last, living, species, in, the, order, ginkgoales, which, first, appeared, over, 290, million, years, ago, and, fossils, very, similar, to, the, living, species, belonging, to, the, genus, ginkgo, extend, back, to, the, middle, jurassic, epoch, approximately, 170, million, years, ago, the, tree, was, cultivated, early, in, human, history, and, remains, commonly, planted, and, is, widely, regarded, as, a, living, fossil, ginkgo, leaf, extract, is, commonly, used, as, a, dietary, supplement, but, there, is, insufficient, clinical, evidence, that, it, supports, human, health, or, is, effective, against, any, disease, the, genus, name, is, regarded, as, a, misspelling, of, the, japanese, pronunciation, gin, ky, for, the, kanji, meaning, silver, apricot, which, is, found, in, chinese, herbology, literature, such, as, daily, use, materia, medica, 1329, and, compendium, of, materia, medica, published, in, 1578, despite, its, spelling, which, is, due, to, a, complicated, etymology, including, a, transcription, error, ginkgo, is, usually, pronounced, k, o, which, has, given, rise, to, the, common, alternative, spelling, gingko, the, spelling, pronunciation, k, o, is, also, documented, in, some, dictionaries, engelbert, kaempfer, first, introduced, the, spelling, ginkgo, in, his, book, amoenitatum, exoticarum, of, 1712, it, is, considered, that, he, may, have, misspelled, ginkjo, or, ginkio, both, consistent, with, his, treatment, of, japanese, ky, in, the, same, work, as, ginkgo, this, misspelling, was, included, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, book, mantissa, plantarum, ii, and, has, become, the, name, of, the, tree, s, genus, the, specific, epithet, biloba, is, new, latin, for, two, lobed, ginkgos, are, large, trees, normally, reaching, a, height, of, 20, 35, m, 66, 115, ft, with, some, specimens, in, china, being, over, 50, m, 165, ft, the, tree, has, an, angular, crown, and, long, somewhat, erratic, branches, and, is, usually, deep, rooted, and, resistant, to, wind, and, snow, damage, young, trees, are, often, tall, and, slender, and, sparsely, branched, the, crown, becomes, broader, as, the, tree, ages, a, combination, of, resistance, to, disease, insect, resistant, wood, and, the, ability, to, form, aerial, roots, and, sprouts, makes, ginkgos, durable, with, some, specimens, claimed, to, be, more, than, 2, 500, years, old, the, leaves, are, unique, among, seed, plants, being, fan, shaped, with, veins, radiating, out, into, the, leaf, blade, sometimes, bifurcating, splitting, but, never, anastomosing, to, form, a, network, two, veins, enter, the, leaf, blade, at, the, base, and, fork, repeatedly, in, two, this, is, known, as, dichotomous, venation, the, leaves, are, usually, 5, 10, cm, 2, 4, in, but, sometimes, up, to, 15, cm, 6, in, long, the, old, common, name, maidenhair, tree, derives, from, the, leaves, resembling, pinnae, of, the, maidenhair, fern, adiantum, capillus, veneris, ginkgos, are, prized, for, their, autumn, foliage, which, is, a, deep, saffron, yellow, leaves, of, long, shoots, are, usually, notched, or, lobed, but, only, from, the, outer, surface, between, the, veins, they, are, borne, both, on, the, more, rapidly, growing, branch, tips, where, they, are, alternate, and, spaced, out, and, also, on, the, short, stubby, spur, shoots, where, they, are, clustered, at, the, tips, leaves, are, green, both, on, the, top, and, bottom, and, have, stomata, on, both, sides, during, autumn, the, leaves, turn, a, bright, yellow, and, then, fall, sometimes, within, a, short, space, of, time, one, to, fifteen, days, ginkgo, branches, grow, in, length, by, growth, of, shoots, with, regularly, spaced, leaves, as, seen, on, most, trees, from, the, axils, of, these, leaves, spur, shoots, also, known, as, short, shoots, develop, on, second, year, growth, short, shoots, have, short, internodes, they, may, grow, only, one, to, two, centimeters, in, several, years, and, their, leaves, are, usually, unlobed, they, are, short, and, knobby, and, are, arranged, regularly, on, the, branches, except, on, first, year, growth, because, of, the, short, internodes, leaves, appear, to, be, clustered, at, the, tips, of, short, shoots, and, reproductive, structures, are, formed, only, on, them, see, pictures, below, seeds, and, leaves, are, visible, on, short, shoots, in, ginkgos, as, in, other, plants, that, possess, them, short, shoots, allow, the, formation, of, new, leaves, in, the, older, parts, of, the, crown, after, a, number, of, years, a, short, shoot, may, change, into, a, long, ordinary, shoot, or, vice, versa, ginkgo, prefers, full, sun, and, grows, best, in, environments, that, are, well, watered, and, well, drained, the, species, shows, a, preference, for, disturbed, sites, in, the, semiwild, stands, at, tianmu, mountains, many, specimens, are, found, along, stream, banks, rocky, slopes, and, cliff, edges, accordingly, ginkgo, retains, a, prodigious, capacity, for, vegetative, growth, it, is, capable, of, sprouting, from, embedded, buds, near, the, base, of, the, trunk, lignotubers, or, basal, chichi, in, response, to, disturbances, such, as, soil, erosion, old, specimens, are, also, capable, of, producing, aerial, roots, on, the, undersides, of, large, branches, in, response, to, disturbances, such, as, crown, damage, these, roots, can, lead, to, successful, clonal, reproduction, upon, contacting, the, soil, these, strategies, are, evidently, important, in, the, persistence, of, ginkgo, in, a, survey, of, the, semiwild, stands, remaining, in, tianmushan, 40, of, the, specimens, surveyed, were, multi, stemmed, and, few, saplings, were, present, 86, 87, ginkgo, biloba, is, dioecious, with, separate, sexes, some, trees, being, female, and, others, being, male, male, plants, produce, small, pollen, cones, with, sporophylls, each, bearing, two, microsporangia, spirally, arranged, around, a, central, axis, female, plants, do, not, produce, cones, two, ovules, are, formed, at, the, end, of, a, stalk, and, after, wind, pollination, one, or, both, develop, into, fruit, like, structures, containing, seeds, the, fruits, are, 1, 5, 2, cm, long, with, a, soft, fleshy, yellow, brown, outer, layer, the, sarcotesta, that, is, attractive, in, appearance, but, contains, butyric, acid, also, known, as, butanoic, acid, and, smells, foul, like, rancid, butter, or, vomit, when, fallen, beneath, the, sarcotesta, is, the, hard, sclerotesta, the, shell, of, the, seed, and, a, papery, endotesta, with, the, nucellus, surrounding, the, female, gametophyte, at, the, center, the, fertilization, of, ginkgo, seeds, occurs, via, motile, sperm, as, in, cycads, ferns, mosses, and, algae, the, sperm, are, large, about, 70, 90, micrometres, and, are, similar, to, the, sperm, of, cycads, which, are, slightly, larger, ginkgo, sperm, were, first, discovered, by, the, japanese, botanist, sakugoro, hirase, in, 1896, the, sperm, have, a, complex, multi, layered, structure, which, is, a, continuous, belt, of, basal, bodies, that, form, the, base, of, several, thousand, flagella, which, have, a, cilia, like, motion, the, flagella, cilia, apparatus, pulls, the, body, of, the, sperm, forwards, the, sperm, have, only, a, tiny, distance, to, travel, to, the, archegonia, of, which, there, are, usually, two, or, three, two, sperm, are, produced, one, of, which, successfully, fertilizes, the, ovule, fertilization, of, ginkgo, seeds, occurs, just, before, or, after, they, fall, in, early, autumn, embryos, may, develop, in, the, seeds, before, or, after, they, drop, from, the, tree, chinese, scientists, published, a, draft, genome, of, ginkgo, biloba, in, 2016, the, tree, has, a, large, genome, of, 10, 6, billion, dna, nucleobase, letters, the, human, genome, has, three, billion, and, about, 41, 840, predicted, genes, which, enable, a, considerable, number, of, antibacterial, and, chemical, defense, mechanisms, 76, 58, of, the, assembled, sequence, turned, out, to, be, repetitive, sequences, in, 2020, a, study, in, china, of, ginkgo, trees, up, to, 667, years, old, showed, little, effects, of, aging, finding, that, the, trees, continued, to, grow, with, age, and, displayed, no, genetic, evidence, of, senescence, and, continued, to, make, phytochemicals, indefinitely, extracts, of, ginkgo, leaves, contain, phenolic, acids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid, glycosides, such, as, myricetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and, quercetin, and, the, terpene, trilactones, ginkgolides, and, bilobalides, the, leaves, also, contain, unique, ginkgo, biflavones, alkylphenols, and, polyprenols, the, older, chinese, name, for, this, plant, is, meaning, silver, fruit, pronounced, y, ngu, in, mandarin, or, ngan, gwo, in, cantonese, the, current, commonly, used, names, are, b, i, gu, meaning, white, fruit, and, y, nx, ng, meaning, silver, apricot, the, name, was, translated, into, japanese, as, ichou, or, ginnan, and, into, korean, as, eunhaeng, carl, linnaeus, described, the, species, in, 1771, the, specific, epithet, biloba, derived, from, the, latin, bis, twice, and, loba, lobed, referring, to, the, shape, of, the, leaves, two, names, for, the, species, recognise, the, botanist, richard, salisbury, a, placement, by, nelson, as, pterophyllus, salisburiensis, and, the, earlier, salisburia, adiantifolia, proposed, by, james, edward, smith, the, epithet, of, the, latter, may, have, been, intended, to, denote, a, characteristic, resembling, adiantum, the, genus, of, maidenhair, ferns, the, scientific, name, ginkgo, is, the, result, of, a, spelling, error, that, occurred, three, centuries, ago, kanji, typically, have, multiple, pronunciations, in, japanese, and, the, characters, used, for, ginnan, can, also, be, pronounced, ginky, engelbert, kaempfer, the, first, westerner, to, investigate, the, species, in, 1690, wrote, down, this, pronunciation, in, the, notes, that, he, later, used, for, the, amoenitates, exoticae, 1712, with, the, awkward, spelling, ginkgo, this, appears, to, be, a, simple, error, of, kaempfer, taking, his, spelling, of, other, japanese, words, containing, the, syllable, ky, into, account, a, more, precise, romanization, following, his, writing, habits, would, have, been, ginkio, or, ginkjo, linnaeus, who, relied, on, kaempfer, when, dealing, with, japanese, plants, adopted, the, spelling, given, in, kaempfer, s, flora, japonica, amoenitates, exoticae, p, 811, kaempfer, s, drawing, can, be, found, in, hori, s, article, the, relationship, of, ginkgo, to, other, plant, groups, remains, uncertain, it, has, been, placed, loosely, in, the, divisions, spermatophyta, and, pinophyta, but, no, consensus, has, been, reached, since, its, seeds, are, not, protected, by, an, ovary, wall, it, can, morphologically, be, considered, a, gymnosperm, the, apricot, like, structures, produced, by, female, ginkgo, trees, are, technically, not, fruits, but, are, seeds, that, have, a, shell, consisting, of, a, soft, and, fleshy, section, the, sarcotesta, and, a, hard, section, the, sclerotesta, the, sarcotesta, has, a, strong, smell, that, most, people, find, unpleasant, the, ginkgo, is, classified, in, its, own, division, the, ginkgophyta, comprising, the, single, class, ginkgoopsida, order, ginkgoales, family, ginkgoaceae, genus, ginkgo, and, is, the, only, extant, species, within, this, group, it, is, one, of, the, best, known, examples, of, a, living, fossil, because, ginkgoales, other, than, g, biloba, are, not, known, from, the, fossil, record, after, the, pliocene, ginkgo, biloba, is, a, living, fossil, with, fossils, recognisably, related, to, modern, ginkgo, from, the, early, permian, cisuralian, with, likely, oldest, record, being, that, of, trichopitys, from, the, earliest, permian, asselian, of, france, over, 290, million, years, old, the, closest, living, relatives, of, the, clade, are, the, cycads, 84, which, share, with, the, extant, g, biloba, the, characteristic, of, motile, sperm, such, plants, with, leaves, that, have, more, than, four, veins, per, segment, have, customarily, been, assigned, to, the, taxon, ginkgo, while, the, taxon, baiera, is, used, to, classify, those, with, fewer, than, four, veins, per, segment, sphenobaiera, has, been, used, for, plants, with, a, broadly, wedge, shaped, leaf, that, lacks, a, distinct, leaf, stem, fossils, attributable, to, the, genus, ginkgo, first, appeared, in, the, middle, jurassic, the, genus, ginkgo, diversified, and, spread, throughout, laurasia, during, the, jurassic, and, early, cretaceous, the, ginkgophyta, declined, in, diversity, as, the, cretaceous, progressed, and, by, the, paleocene, ginkgo, adiantoides, was, the, only, ginkgo, species, left, in, the, northern, hemisphere, while, a, markedly, different, and, poorly, documented, form, persisted, in, the, southern, hemisphere, along, with, that, of, ferns, cycads, and, cycadeoids, the, species, diversity, in, the, genus, ginkgo, drops, through, the, cretaceous, at, the, same, time, the, flowering, plants, were, on, the, rise, this, supports, the, hypothesis, that, over, time, flowering, plants, with, better, adaptations, to, disturbance, displaced, ginkgo, and, its, associates, 93, at, the, end, of, the, pliocene, ginkgo, fossils, disappeared, from, the, fossil, record, everywhere, except, in, a, small, area, of, central, china, where, the, modern, species, survived, it, is, doubtful, whether, the, northern, hemisphere, fossil, species, of, ginkgo, can, be, reliably, distinguished, given, the, slow, pace, of, evolution, and, morphological, similarity, between, members, of, the, genus, there, may, have, been, only, one, or, two, species, existing, in, the, northern, hemisphere, through, the, entirety, of, the, cenozoic, present, day, g, biloba, including, g, adiantoides, and, g, gardneri, from, the, paleocene, of, scotland, 85, at, least, morphologically, g, gardneri, and, the, southern, hemisphere, species, are, the, only, known, post, jurassic, taxa, that, can, be, unequivocally, recognised, the, remainder, may, have, been, ecotypes, or, subspecies, the, implications, would, be, that, g, biloba, had, occurred, over, an, extremely, wide, range, had, remarkable, genetic, flexibility, and, though, evolving, genetically, never, showed, much, speciation, while, it, may, seem, improbable, that, a, single, species, may, exist, as, a, contiguous, entity, for, many, millions, of, years, many, of, the, ginkgo, s, life, history, parameters, fit, extreme, longevity, slow, reproduction, rate, in, cenozoic, and, later, times, a, wide, apparently, contiguous, but, steadily, contracting, distribution, and, as, far, as, can, be, demonstrated, from, the, fossil, record, extreme, ecological, conservatism, restriction, to, disturbed, streamside, environments, 91, given, the, slow, rate, of, evolution, of, the, genus, ginkgo, possibly, represents, a, pre, angiosperm, strategy, for, survival, in, disturbed, streamside, environments, ginkgo, evolved, in, an, era, before, flowering, plants, when, ferns, cycads, and, cycadeoids, dominated, disturbed, streamside, environments, forming, low, open, shrubby, canopies, ginkgo, s, large, seeds, and, habit, of, bolting, growing, to, a, height, of, 10, meters, before, elongating, its, side, branches, may, be, adaptations, to, such, an, environment, modern, day, g, biloba, grows, best, in, environments, that, are, well, watered, and, drained, 87, and, the, extremely, similar, fossil, ginkgo, favored, similar, environments, the, sediment, record, at, the, majority, of, fossil, ginkgo, localities, indicates, it, grew, primarily, in, disturbed, environments, such, as, along, streams, ginkgo, therefore, presents, an, ecological, paradox, because, while, it, possesses, some, favorable, traits, for, living, in, disturbed, environments, clonal, reproduction, many, of, its, other, life, history, traits, are, the, opposite, of, those, exhibited, by, modern, plants, that, thrive, in, disturbed, settings, slow, growth, large, seed, size, late, reproductive, maturity, 92, although, ginkgo, biloba, and, other, species, of, the, genus, were, once, widespread, throughout, the, world, its, habitat, had, shrunk, by, two, million, years, ago, for, centuries, it, was, thought, to, be, extinct, in, the, wild, but, is, now, a, common, tree, cultivated, throughout, eastern, china, korea, and, japan, many, municipalities, in, korea, and, japan, use, ginkgos, as, street, trees, and, ginkgo, leaves, are, the, emblem, of, prominent, educational, institutions, such, as, the, university, of, tokyo, and, sungkyunkwan, university, in, south, korea, despite, their, widespread, habitat, high, genetic, uniformity, exists, among, ginkgo, trees, with, some, chinese, scholars, suggesting, that, ginkgo, trees, in, these, areas, may, have, been, planted, and, preserved, by, chinese, monks, over, about, 1, 000, years, a, study, demonstrates, a, greater, genetic, diversity, in, southwestern, china, populations, supporting, glacial, refugia, in, mountains, surrounding, the, eastern, tibetan, plateau, where, several, old, growth, candidates, for, wild, populations, have, been, reported, recently, the, findings, of, ginkgo, trees, aged, 1, 500, years, in, samcheok, si, korea, the, neukguri, ginkgo, designated, as, korea, s, natural, artifact, in, 1986, and, aged, 1, 200, in, tsurugaoka, hachimangu, shrine, in, japan, have, discredited, theories, claiming, chinese, origins, of, ginkgo, whether, native, ginkgo, populations, still, exist, has, not, been, demonstrated, unequivocally, but, there, is, genetic, evidence, that, these, southwestern, populations, may, be, wild, as, well, as, evidence, that, the, largest, and, oldest, ginkgo, biloba, trees, may, be, older, than, surrounding, human, settlements, where, it, occurs, in, the, wild, ginkgo, is, found, infrequently, in, deciduous, forests, and, valleys, on, acidic, loess, i, e, fine, silty, soil, with, good, drainage, the, soil, it, inhabits, is, typically, in, the, ph, range, of, 5, 0, to, 5, 5, ginkgo, has, long, been, cultivated, in, china, it, is, common, in, the, southern, third, of, the, country, some, planted, trees, at, temples, are, believed, to, be, over, 1, 500, years, old, the, first, record, of, europeans, encountering, it, is, in, 1690, in, japanese, temple, gardens, where, the, tree, was, seen, by, the, german, botanist, engelbert, kaempfer, because, of, its, status, in, buddhism, and, confucianism, the, ginkgo, has, also, been, widely, planted, in, korea, and, in, japan, since, the, 14th, century, in, both, areas, some, naturalization, has, occurred, with, ginkgos, seeding, into, natural, forests, ginkgo, has, been, commonly, cultivated, in, north, america, for, over, 200, years, and, in, europe, for, close, to, 300, but, during, that, time, it, has, never, become, significantly, naturalized, g, biloba, is, also, commonly, manually, planted, in, cities, across, the, united, states, and, europe, this, species, is, highly, tolerant, to, pollution, and, serves, as, a, visually, appealing, shade, providing, tree, in, many, cities, and, gardens, many, intentionally, planted, ginkgos, are, male, cultivars, grafted, onto, plants, propagated, from, seed, because, the, male, trees, will, not, produce, the, malodorous, seeds, the, popular, cultivar, autumn, gold, is, a, clone, of, a, male, plant, the, disadvantage, of, male, ginkgo, biloba, trees, is, that, they, are, highly, allergenic, they, have, an, opals, ogren, plant, allergy, scale, rating, of, 7, out, of, 10, whereas, female, trees, which, can, produce, no, pollen, have, an, opals, allergy, scale, rating, of, 2, female, cultivars, include, liberty, splendor, santa, cruz, and, golden, girl, the, latter, so, named, because, of, the, striking, yellow, color, of, its, leaves, in, the, fall, all, female, cultivars, release, zero, pollen, many, cultivars, are, listed, in, the, literature, in, the, uk, of, which, the, compact, troll, has, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, ginkgos, adapt, well, to, the, urban, environment, tolerating, pollution, and, confined, soil, spaces, they, rarely, have, disease, problems, even, in, urban, conditions, and, are, attacked, by, few, insects, ginkgos, are, popular, subjects, for, growing, as, miniature, landscapes, known, as, penjing, and, bonsai, they, can, be, kept, artificially, small, and, tended, over, centuries, the, trees, are, easy, to, propagate, from, seed, extreme, examples, of, the, ginkgo, s, tenacity, may, be, seen, in, hiroshima, japan, where, six, trees, growing, between, 1, and, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, and, 1, 1, 4, miles, from, the, 1945, atom, bomb, explosion, were, among, the, few, living, organisms, in, the, area, to, survive, the, blast, although, almost, all, other, plants, and, animals, in, the, area, were, killed, the, ginkgos, though, charred, survived, and, were, soon, healthy, again, among, other, hibakujumoku, trees, that, survived, the, blast, the, six, trees, are, still, alive, they, are, marked, with, signs, at, housenbou, temple, planted, in, 1850, shukkei, en, planted, about, 1740, j, sei, ji, planted, 1900, at, the, former, site, of, senda, elementary, school, near, miyukibashi, at, the, my, j, in, temple, and, an, edo, period, cutting, at, anraku, ji, temple, at, the, tsurugaoka, hachiman, g, s, shrine, in, the, city, of, kamakura, kanagawa, prefecture, japan, an, ancient, ginkgo, tree, stands, beside, the, stone, entry, staircase, according, to, legend, the, tree, has, stood, there, since, the, founding, of, the, shrine, circa, 1063, the, tree, is, nicknamed, kakure, ich, hiding, ginkgo, because, of, an, edo, period, legend, in, which, sh, gun, minamoto, no, sanetomo, was, assassinated, in, 1219, by, his, nephew, kugy, who, had, hidden, behind, the, tree, to, ambush, the, sh, gun, modern, scholarship, has, established, that, ginkgos, arrived, from, china, in, the, 14th, century, and, a, 1990, tree, ring, measurement, indicated, the, kakure, ich, s, age, to, be, about, 500, years, on, 10, march, 2010, the, tree, blew, down, in, a, storm, but, the, stump, has, since, sprouted, vigorously, the, grounds, of, the, buddhist, temple, at, gu, guanyin, in, the, zhongnan, mountains, feature, a, ginkgo, tree, reputed, to, be, 1, 400, years, old, the, tree, itself, is, a, popular, tourist, attraction, the, wood, of, ginkgo, biloba, is, used, to, make, furniture, chessboards, carving, and, casks, for, making, sak, the, wood, is, fire, resistant, and, slow, to, decay, the, nut, like, kernels, of, the, seeds, are, particularly, esteemed, in, asia, and, are, a, traditional, ingredient, in, chinese, food, ginkgo, nuts, are, used, in, congee, and, are, often, served, at, special, occasions, such, as, weddings, and, the, chinese, new, year, as, part, of, the, vegetarian, dish, called, buddha, s, delight, japanese, cooks, add, ginkgo, seeds, called, ginnan, to, dishes, such, as, chawanmushi, and, cooked, seeds, are, often, eaten, along, with, other, dishes, grilled, ginkgo, nuts, with, salt, are, also, a, popular, item, at, izakayas, as, a, healthy, snack, with, beer, and, other, japanese, food, in, korea, ginkgo, nuts, are, stir, fried, and, eaten, or, are, used, to, garnish, foods, such, as, sinseonro, when, eaten, in, large, quantities, or, over, a, long, period, the, seeds, may, cause, poisoning, by, ginkgotoxin, 4, o, methylpyridoxine, mpn, as, found, in, a, few, case, reports, a, heat, stable, compound, not, destroyed, by, cooking, mpn, may, cause, convulsions, which, were, alleviated, by, treatment, with, pyridoxine, phosphate, vitamin, b6, according, to, limited, studies, some, people, are, sensitive, to, the, chemicals, in, the, sarcotesta, the, outer, fleshy, coating, these, people, should, handle, the, seeds, with, care, when, preparing, the, seeds, for, consumption, wearing, disposable, gloves, the, symptoms, are, allergic, contact, dermatitis, or, blisters, similar, to, that, caused, by, contact, with, poison, ivy, although, extracts, of, ginkgo, biloba, leaf, are, often, marketed, as, cognitive, enhancers, there, is, no, evidence, for, effects, on, memory, or, attention, in, healthy, people, systematic, reviews, have, shown, there, is, no, evidence, for, effectiveness, of, ginkgo, in, treating, high, blood, pressure, menopause, related, cognitive, decline, tinnitus, post, stroke, recovery, or, altitude, sickness, there, is, weak, preliminary, evidence, for, ginkgo, affecting, dementia, and, tardive, dyskinesia, symptoms, in, people, with, schizophrenia, side, effects, of, using, ginkgo, supplements, may, include, increased, risk, of, bleeding, gastrointestinal, discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
