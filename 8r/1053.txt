the, peach, prunus, persica, is, a, deciduous, tree, first, domesticated, and, cultivated, in, zhejiang, province, of, eastern, china, it, bears, edible, juicy, fruits, with, various, characteristics, most, called, peaches, and, others, the, glossy, skinned, non, fuzzy, varieties, nectarines, the, specific, name, persica, refers, to, its, widespread, cultivation, in, persia, modern, day, iran, from, where, it, was, transplanted, to, europe, and, in, the, 16th, century, to, the, americas, it, belongs, to, the, genus, prunus, which, includes, the, cherry, apricot, almond, and, plum, and, which, is, part, of, the, rose, family, the, peach, is, classified, with, the, almond, in, the, subgenus, amygdalus, distinguished, from, the, other, subgenera, by, the, corrugated, seed, shell, endocarp, due, to, their, close, relatedness, the, kernel, of, a, peach, stone, tastes, remarkably, similar, to, almond, and, peach, stones, are, often, used, to, make, a, cheap, version, of, marzipan, known, as, persipan, peaches, and, nectarines, are, the, same, species, though, they, are, regarded, commercially, as, different, fruits, the, skin, of, nectarines, lacks, the, fuzz, fruit, skin, trichomes, that, peach, skin, has, a, mutation, in, a, single, gene, myb25, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, difference, between, the, two, in, 2018, china, produced, 62, of, the, world, total, of, peaches, and, nectarines, spain, italy, turkey, and, greece, all, situated, in, the, mediterranean, region, are, prominent, producers, of, peaches, prunus, persica, trees, grow, up, to, 7, m, 23, ft, tall, and, wide, but, when, pruned, properly, they, are, usually, 3, 4, m, 10, 13, ft, tall, and, wide, the, leaves, are, lanceolate, 7, 16, cm, 3, 6, 1, 2, in, long, 2, 3, cm, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, in, broad, and, pinnately, veined, the, flowers, are, produced, in, early, spring, before, the, leaves, they, are, solitary, or, paired, 2, 5, 3, cm, diameter, pink, with, five, petals, the, fruit, has, yellow, or, whitish, flesh, a, delicate, aroma, and, a, skin, that, is, either, velvety, peaches, or, smooth, nectarines, in, different, cultivars, the, flesh, is, very, delicate, and, easily, bruised, in, some, cultivars, but, is, fairly, firm, in, some, commercial, varieties, especially, when, green, the, single, large, seed, is, red, brown, oval, shaped, around, 1, 3, 2, cm, long, and, surrounded, by, a, wood, like, husk, peaches, along, with, cherries, plums, and, apricots, are, stone, fruits, drupes, the, various, heirloom, varieties, including, the, indian, peach, or, indian, blood, peach, which, ripens, in, the, latter, part, of, the, summer, and, can, have, color, ranging, from, red, and, white, to, purple, cultivated, peaches, are, divided, into, clingstones, and, freestones, depending, on, whether, the, flesh, sticks, to, the, stone, or, not, both, can, have, either, white, or, yellow, flesh, peaches, with, white, flesh, typically, are, very, sweet, with, little, acidity, while, yellow, fleshed, peaches, typically, have, an, acidic, tang, coupled, with, sweetness, though, this, also, varies, greatly, both, colors, often, have, some, red, on, their, skins, low, acid, white, fleshed, peaches, are, the, most, popular, kinds, in, china, japan, and, neighbouring, asian, countries, while, europeans, and, north, americans, have, historically, favoured, the, acidic, yellow, fleshed, cultivars, peach, trees, are, relatively, short, lived, as, compared, with, some, other, fruit, trees, in, some, regions, orchards, are, replanted, after, 8, to, 10, years, while, in, others, trees, may, produce, satisfactorily, for, 20, to, 25, years, or, more, depending, upon, their, resistance, to, diseases, pests, and, winter, damage, the, scientific, name, persica, along, with, the, word, peach, itself, and, its, cognates, in, many, european, languages, derives, from, an, early, european, belief, that, peaches, were, native, to, persia, modern, day, iran, the, ancient, romans, referred, to, the, peach, as, malum, persicum, persian, apple, later, becoming, french, p, che, whence, the, english, peach, the, scientific, name, prunus, persica, literally, means, persian, plum, as, it, is, closely, related, to, the, plum, fossil, endocarps, with, characteristics, indistinguishable, from, those, of, modern, peaches, have, been, recovered, from, late, pliocene, deposits, in, kunming, dating, to, 2, 6, million, years, ago, in, the, absence, of, evidence, that, the, plants, were, in, other, ways, identical, to, the, modern, peach, the, name, prunus, kunmingensis, has, been, assigned, to, these, fossils, although, its, botanical, name, prunus, persica, refers, to, persia, genetic, studies, suggest, peaches, originated, in, china, where, they, have, been, cultivated, since, the, neolithic, period, until, recently, cultivation, was, believed, to, have, started, around, 2000, bc, more, recent, evidence, indicates, that, domestication, occurred, as, early, as, 6000, bc, in, zhejiang, province, of, china, the, oldest, archaeological, peach, stones, are, from, the, kuahuqiao, site, near, hangzhou, archaeologists, point, to, the, yangtze, river, valley, as, the, place, where, the, early, selection, for, favorable, peach, varieties, probably, took, place, peaches, were, mentioned, in, chinese, writings, and, literature, beginning, from, the, early, first, millennium, bc, a, domesticated, peach, appeared, very, early, in, japan, in, 4700, 4400, bc, during, the, j, mon, period, it, was, already, similar, to, modern, cultivated, forms, where, the, peach, stones, are, significantly, larger, and, more, compressed, than, earlier, stones, this, domesticated, type, of, peach, was, brought, into, japan, from, china, nevertheless, in, china, itself, this, variety, is, currently, attested, only, at, a, later, date, around, 3300, to, 2300, bc, in, india, the, peach, first, appeared, by, about, 1700, bc, during, the, harappan, period, it, is, also, found, elsewhere, in, west, asia, in, ancient, times, peach, cultivation, reached, greece, by, 300, bc, alexander, the, great, is, sometimes, said, to, have, introduced, them, into, greece, after, conquering, persia, but, no, historical, evidence, for, this, claim, has, been, found, peaches, were, however, well, known, to, the, romans, in, the, first, century, ad, the, oldest, known, artistic, representations, of, the, fruit, are, in, two, fragments, of, wall, paintings, dated, to, the, first, century, ad, in, herculaneum, preserved, due, to, the, vesuvius, eruption, of, 79, ad, and, now, held, in, the, national, archaeological, museum, in, naples, archaeological, finds, show, that, peaches, were, cultivated, widely, in, roman, northwestern, continental, europe, but, production, collapsed, around, the, sixth, century, some, revival, of, production, followed, with, the, carolingian, renaissance, of, the, ninth, century, an, article, on, peach, tree, cultivation, in, spain, is, brought, down, in, ibn, al, awwam, s, 12th, century, agricultural, work, book, on, agriculture, the, peach, was, brought, to, the, americas, by, spanish, explorers, in, the, 16th, century, and, eventually, made, it, to, england, and, france, in, the, 17th, century, where, it, was, a, prized, and, expensive, treat, horticulturist, george, minifie, supposedly, brought, the, first, peaches, from, england, to, its, north, american, colonies, in, the, early, 17th, century, planting, them, at, his, estate, of, buckland, in, virginia, although, thomas, jefferson, had, peach, trees, at, monticello, american, farmers, did, not, begin, commercial, production, until, the, 19th, century, in, maryland, delaware, georgia, south, carolina, and, finally, virginia, the, shanghai, honey, nectar, peach, was, a, key, component, of, both, the, food, culture, and, agrarian, economy, the, area, where, the, modern, megacity, of, shanghai, stands, peaches, were, the, cornerstone, of, early, shanghai, s, garden, culture, as, modernization, and, westernization, swept, through, the, city, the, shanghai, honey, nectar, peach, nearly, disappeared, completely, much, of, modern, shanghai, is, built, over, these, gardens, and, peach, orchards, in, april, 2010, an, international, consortium, the, international, peach, genome, initiative, which, includes, researchers, from, the, united, states, italy, chile, spain, and, france, announced, they, had, sequenced, the, peach, tree, genome, doubled, haploid, lovell, recently, it, published, the, peach, genome, sequence, and, related, analyses, the, sequence, is, composed, of, 227, million, nucleotides, arranged, in, eight, pseudomolecules, representing, the, eight, peach, chromosomes, 2n, 16, in, addition, 27, 852, protein, coding, genes, and, 28, 689, protein, coding, transcripts, were, predicted, particular, emphasis, in, this, study, is, reserved, for, the, analysis, of, the, genetic, diversity, in, peach, germplasm, and, how, it, was, shaped, by, human, activities, such, as, domestication, and, breeding, major, historical, bottlenecks, were, found, one, related, to, the, putative, original, domestication, that, is, supposed, to, have, taken, place, in, china, about, 4, 000, 5, 000, years, ago, the, second, is, related, to, the, western, germplasm, and, is, due, to, the, early, dissemination, of, the, peach, in, europe, from, china, and, the, more, recent, breeding, activities, in, the, united, states, and, europe, these, bottlenecks, highlighted, the, substantial, reduction, of, genetic, diversity, associated, with, domestication, and, breeding, activities, peaches, were, introduced, into, the, americas, in, the, 16th, century, by, the, spanish, by, 1580, peaches, were, being, grown, in, latin, america, and, were, cultivated, by, the, remnants, of, the, inca, empire, in, argentina, in, the, united, states, the, peach, was, soon, adopted, as, a, crop, by, american, indians, the, peach, also, became, naturalized, and, abundant, as, a, wild, species, in, the, eastern, u, s, peaches, were, being, grown, in, virginia, as, early, as, 1629, peaches, grown, by, indians, in, virginia, were, said, to, have, been, of, greater, variety, and, finer, sorts, than, those, of, the, english, colonists, also, in, 1629, peaches, were, listed, as, a, crop, in, new, mexico, william, penn, noted, the, existence, of, wild, peaches, in, pennsylvania, in, 1683, peach, plantations, became, an, objective, of, american, military, campaigns, against, the, indians, in, 1779, the, sullivan, expedition, destroyed, the, livelihood, of, many, of, the, iroquois, people, of, new, york, among, the, crops, destroyed, were, plantations, of, peach, trees, in, 1864, kit, carson, led, a, successful, u, s, army, expedition, to, canyon, de, chelly, arizona, to, destroy, the, livelihood, of, the, navajo, carson, destroyed, thousands, of, peach, trees, a, soldier, said, they, were, the, best, peach, trees, i, have, ever, seen, in, the, country, every, one, of, them, bearing, fruit, peaches, grow, in, a, fairly, limited, range, in, dry, continental, or, temperate, climates, since, the, trees, have, a, chilling, requirement, that, tropical, or, subtropical, areas, generally, do, not, satisfy, except, at, high, altitudes, for, example, in, certain, areas, of, ecuador, colombia, ethiopia, india, and, nepal, most, cultivars, require, 500, hours, of, chilling, around, 0, to, 10, c, 32, to, 50, f, during, the, chilling, period, key, chemical, reactions, occur, but, the, plant, appears, dormant, once, the, chilling, period, is, fulfilled, the, plant, enters, a, second, type, of, dormancy, the, quiescence, period, during, quiescence, buds, break, and, grow, when, sufficient, warm, weather, favorable, to, growth, is, accumulated, the, trees, themselves, can, usually, tolerate, temperatures, to, around, 26, to, 30, c, 15, to, 22, f, although, the, following, season, s, flower, buds, are, usually, killed, at, these, temperatures, preventing, a, crop, that, summer, flower, bud, death, begins, to, occur, between, 15, and, 25, c, 5, and, 13, f, depending, on, the, cultivar, and, on, the, timing, of, the, cold, with, the, buds, becoming, less, cold, tolerant, in, late, winter, another, climate, constraint, is, spring, frost, the, trees, flower, fairly, early, in, march, in, western, europe, and, the, blossom, is, damaged, or, killed, if, temperatures, drop, below, about, 4, c, 25, f, if, the, flowers, are, not, fully, open, though, they, can, tolerate, a, few, degrees, colder, climates, with, significant, winter, rainfall, at, temperatures, below, 16, c, 61, f, are, also, unsuitable, for, peach, cultivation, as, the, rain, promotes, peach, leaf, curl, which, is, the, most, serious, fungal, disease, for, peaches, in, practice, fungicides, are, extensively, used, for, peach, cultivation, in, such, climates, with, more, than, 1, of, european, peaches, exceeding, legal, pesticide, limits, in, 2013, finally, summer, heat, is, required, to, mature, the, crop, with, mean, temperatures, of, the, hottest, month, between, 20, and, 30, c, 68, and, 86, f, typical, peach, cultivars, begin, bearing, fruit, in, their, third, year, their, lifespan, in, the, u, s, varies, by, region, the, university, of, california, at, davis, gives, a, lifespan, of, about, 15, years, while, the, university, of, maine, gives, a, lifespan, of, 7, years, there, hundreds, of, peach, and, nectarine, cultivars, are, known, these, are, classified, into, two, categories, freestones, and, clingstones, freestones, are, those, whose, flesh, separates, readily, from, the, pit, clingstones, are, those, whose, flesh, clings, tightly, to, the, pit, some, cultivars, are, partially, freestone, and, clingstone, so, are, called, semifree, freestone, types, are, preferred, for, eating, fresh, while, clingstone, types, are, for, canning, the, fruit, flesh, may, be, creamy, white, to, deep, yellow, to, dark, red, the, hue, and, shade, of, the, color, depend, on, the, cultivar, peach, breeding, has, favored, cultivars, with, more, firmness, more, red, color, and, shorter, fuzz, on, the, fruit, surface, these, characteristics, ease, shipping, and, supermarket, sales, by, improving, eye, appeal, this, selection, process, has, not, necessarily, led, to, increased, flavor, though, peaches, have, a, short, shelf, life, so, commercial, growers, typically, plant, a, mix, of, different, cultivars, to, have, fruit, to, ship, all, season, long, different, countries, have, different, cultivars, in, the, united, kingdom, for, example, these, cultivars, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, for, china, specifically, see, peach, production, in, china, cultivars, the, variety, p, persica, var, nucipersica, or, var, nectarina, these, are, commonly, called, nectarines, has, a, smooth, skin, it, is, on, occasion, referred, to, as, a, shaved, peach, or, fuzzless, peach, due, to, its, lack, of, fuzz, or, short, hairs, though, fuzzy, peaches, and, nectarines, are, regarded, commercially, as, different, fruits, with, nectarines, often, erroneously, believed, to, be, a, crossbreed, between, peaches, and, plums, or, a, peach, with, a, plum, skin, nectarines, belong, to, the, same, species, as, peaches, several, genetic, studies, have, concluded, nectarines, are, produced, due, to, a, recessive, allele, whereas, a, fuzzy, peach, skin, is, dominant, nectarines, have, arisen, many, times, from, peach, trees, often, as, bud, sports, as, with, peaches, nectarines, can, be, white, or, yellow, and, clingstone, or, freestone, on, average, nectarines, are, slightly, smaller, and, sweeter, than, peaches, but, with, much, overlap, the, lack, of, skin, fuzz, can, make, nectarine, skins, appear, more, reddish, than, those, of, peaches, contributing, to, the, fruit, s, plum, like, appearance, the, lack, of, down, on, nectarines, skin, also, means, their, skin, is, more, easily, bruised, than, peaches, the, history, of, the, nectarine, is, unclear, the, first, recorded, mention, in, english, is, from, 1616, but, they, had, probably, been, grown, much, earlier, within, the, native, range, of, the, peach, in, central, and, eastern, asia, although, one, source, states, that, nectarines, were, introduced, into, the, united, states, by, david, fairchild, of, the, department, of, agriculture, in, 1906, a, number, of, colonial, era, newspaper, articles, make, reference, to, nectarines, being, grown, in, the, united, states, prior, to, the, revolutionary, war, the, 28, march, 1768, edition, of, the, new, york, gazette, p, 3, for, example, mentions, a, farm, in, jamaica, long, island, new, york, where, nectarines, were, grown, peacherines, are, claimed, to, be, a, cross, between, a, peach, and, a, nectarine, but, as, they, are, the, same, species, cannot, be, a, true, cross, hybrid, they, are, marketed, in, australia, and, new, zealand, the, fruit, is, intermediate, in, appearance, though, between, a, peach, and, a, nectarine, large, and, brightly, colored, like, a, red, peach, the, flesh, of, the, fruit, is, usually, yellow, but, white, varieties, also, exist, the, koanga, institute, lists, varieties, that, ripen, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, february, and, march, in, 1909, pacific, monthly, mentioned, peacherines, in, a, news, bulletin, for, california, louise, pound, in, 1920, claimed, the, term, peacherine, is, an, example, of, language, stunt, flat, peaches, or, pan, tao, have, a, flattened, shape, in, contrast, to, ordinary, near, spherical, peaches, most, peach, trees, sold, by, nurseries, are, cultivars, budded, or, grafted, onto, a, suitable, rootstock, common, rootstocks, are, lovell, peach, nemaguard, peach, prunus, besseyi, and, citation, the, rootstock, provides, hardiness, and, budding, is, done, to, improve, predictability, of, the, fruit, quality, peach, trees, need, full, sun, and, a, layout, that, allows, good, natural, air, flow, to, assist, the, thermal, environment, for, the, tree, peaches, are, planted, in, early, winter, during, the, growth, season, they, need, a, regular, and, reliable, supply, of, water, with, higher, amounts, just, before, harvest, peaches, need, nitrogen, rich, fertilizers, more, than, other, fruit, trees, without, regular, fertilizer, supply, peach, tree, leaves, start, turning, yellow, or, exhibit, stunted, growth, blood, meal, bone, meal, and, calcium, ammonium, nitrate, are, suitable, fertilizers, the, flowers, on, a, peach, tree, are, typically, thinned, out, because, if, the, full, number, of, peaches, mature, on, a, branch, they, are, undersized, and, lack, flavor, fruits, are, thinned, midway, in, the, season, by, commercial, growers, fresh, peaches, are, easily, bruised, so, do, not, store, well, they, are, most, flavorful, when, they, ripen, on, the, tree, and, are, eaten, the, day, of, harvest, the, peach, tree, can, be, grown, in, an, espalier, shape, the, baldassari, palmette, is, a, design, created, around, 1950, used, primarily, for, training, peaches, in, walled, gardens, constructed, from, stone, or, brick, which, absorb, and, retain, solar, heat, and, then, slowly, release, it, raising, the, temperature, against, the, wall, peaches, can, be, grown, as, espaliers, against, south, facing, walls, as, far, north, as, southeast, great, britain, and, southern, ireland, the, first, pest, to, attack, the, tree, early, in, the, year, when, other, food, is, scarce, is, the, earwig, forficula, auricularia, which, feeds, on, blossoms, and, young, leaves, at, night, preventing, fruiting, and, weakening, newly, planted, trees, the, pattern, of, damage, is, distinct, from, that, of, caterpillars, later, in, the, year, as, earwigs, characteristically, remove, semicircles, of, petal, and, leaf, tissue, from, the, tips, rather, than, internally, greasebands, applied, just, before, blossom, are, effective, the, larvae, of, such, moth, species, as, the,

which, usually, does, not, directly, affect, the, fruit, but, does, reduce, the, crop, yield, by, partially, defoliating, the, tree, several, fungicides, can, be, used, to, combat, the, disease, including, bordeaux, mixture, and, other, copper, based, products, the, university, of, california, considers, these, organic, treatments, ziram, chlorothalonil, and, dodine, the, fruit, is, susceptible, to, brown, rot, or, a, dark, reddish, spot, peaches, and, nectarines, are, best, stored, at, temperatures, of, 0, c, 32, f, and, in, high, humidity, they, are, highly, perishable, so, are, typically, consumed, or, canned, within, two, weeks, of, harvest, peaches, are, climacteric, fruits, and, continue, to, ripen, after, being, picked, from, the, tree, in, 2020, world, production, of, peaches, combined, with, nectarines, for, reporting, was, 24, 6, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 61, of, the, world, total, table, the, u, s, state, of, georgia, is, known, as, the, peach, state, due, to, its, significant, production, of, peaches, as, early, as, 1571, with, exports, to, other, states, occurring, around, 1858, in, 2014, georgia, was, third, in, us, peach, production, behind, california, and, south, carolina, the, largest, peach, producing, countries, in, latin, america, are, argentina, brazil, chile, and, mexico, peaches, are, not, only, a, popular, fruit, but, also, are, symbolic, in, many, cultural, traditions, such, as, in, art, paintings, and, folk, tales, such, as, the, peaches, of, immortality, peach, blossoms, are, highly, prized, in, chinese, culture, the, ancient, chinese, believed, the, peach, to, possess, more, vitality, than, any, other, tree, because, their, blossoms, appear, before, leaves, sprout, when, early, rulers, of, china, visited, their, territories, they, were, preceded, by, sorcerers, armed, with, peach, rods, to, protect, them, from, spectral, evils, on, new, year, s, eve, local, magistrates, would, cut, peach,
