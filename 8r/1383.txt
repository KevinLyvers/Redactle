inflammation, from, latin, inflammatio, is, part, of, the, biological, response, of, body, tissues, to, harmful, stimuli, such, as, pathogens, damaged, cells, or, irritants, the, five, cardinal, signs, are, heat, pain, redness, swelling, and, loss, of, function, latin, calor, dolor, rubor, tumor, and, functio, laesa, inflammation, is, a, generic, response, and, therefore, is, considered, a, mechanism, of, innate, immunity, whereas, adaptive, immunity, is, specific, to, each, pathogen, inflammation, is, a, protective, response, involving, immune, cells, blood, vessels, and, molecular, mediators, the, function, of, inflammation, is, to, eliminate, the, initial, cause, of, cell, injury, clear, out, damaged, cells, and, tissues, and, initiate, tissue, repair, too, little, inflammation, could, lead, to, progressive, tissue, destruction, by, the, harmful, stimulus, e, g, bacteria, and, compromise, the, survival, of, the, organism, however, inflammation, can, also, have, negative, effects, too, much, inflammation, in, the, form, of, chronic, inflammation, is, associated, with, various, diseases, such, as, hay, fever, periodontal, disease, atherosclerosis, and, osteoarthritis, inflammation, can, be, classified, as, acute, or, chronic, acute, inflammation, is, the, initial, response, of, the, body, to, harmful, stimuli, and, is, achieved, by, the, increased, movement, of, plasma, and, leukocytes, in, particular, granulocytes, from, the, blood, into, the, injured, tissues, a, series, of, biochemical, events, propagates, and, matures, the, inflammatory, response, involving, the, local, vascular, system, the, immune, system, and, various, cells, in, the, injured, tissue, prolonged, inflammation, known, as, chronic, inflammation, leads, to, a, progressive, shift, in, the, type, of, cells, present, at, the, site, of, inflammation, such, as, mononuclear, cells, and, involves, simultaneous, destruction, and, healing, of, the, tissue, inflammation, has, also, been, classified, as, type, 1, and, type, 2, based, on, the, type, of, cytokines, and, helper, t, cells, th1, and, th2, involved, the, earliest, known, reference, for, the, term, inflammation, is, around, the, early, 15th, century, the, word, root, comes, from, old, french, inflammation, around, the, 14th, century, which, then, comes, from, latin, inflammatio, or, inflammationem, literally, the, term, relates, to, the, word, flame, as, the, property, of, being, set, on, fire, or, to, burn, the, term, inflammation, is, not, a, synonym, for, infection, infection, describes, the, interaction, between, the, action, of, microbial, invasion, and, the, reaction, of, the, body, s, inflammatory, response, the, two, components, are, considered, together, in, discussion, of, infection, and, the, word, is, used, to, imply, a, microbial, invasive, cause, for, the, observed, inflammatory, reaction, inflammation, on, the, other, hand, describes, just, the, body, s, immunovascular, response, regardless, of, cause, but, because, of, the, two, are, often, correlated, words, ending, in, the, suffix, itis, which, means, inflammation, are, sometimes, informally, described, as, referring, to, infection, for, example, the, word, urethritis, strictly, means, only, urethral, inflammation, but, clinical, health, care, providers, usually, discuss, urethritis, as, a, urethral, infection, because, urethral, microbial, invasion, is, the, most, common, cause, of, urethritis, however, the, inflammation, infection, distinction, is, crucial, in, situations, in, pathology, and, medical, diagnosis, that, involve, inflammation, that, is, not, driven, by, microbial, invasion, such, as, cases, of, atherosclerosis, trauma, ischemia, and, autoimmune, diseases, including, type, iii, hypersensitivity, biological, chemical, psychological, acute, inflammation, is, a, short, term, process, usually, appearing, within, a, few, minutes, or, hours, and, begins, to, cease, upon, the, removal, of, the, injurious, stimulus, it, involves, a, coordinated, and, systemic, mobilization, response, locally, of, various, immune, endocrine, and, neurological, mediators, of, acute, inflammation, in, a, normal, healthy, response, it, becomes, activated, clears, the, pathogen, and, begins, a, repair, process, and, then, ceases, acute, inflammation, occurs, immediately, upon, injury, lasting, only, a, few, days, cytokines, and, chemokines, promote, the, migration, of, neutrophils, and, macrophages, to, the, site, of, inflammation, pathogens, allergens, toxins, burns, and, frostbite, are, some, of, the, typical, causes, of, acute, inflammation, toll, like, receptors, tlrs, recognize, microbial, pathogens, acute, inflammation, can, be, a, defensive, mechanism, to, protect, tissues, against, injury, inflammation, lasting, 2, 6, weeks, is, designated, subacute, inflammation, inflammation, is, characterized, by, five, cardinal, signs, the, traditional, names, of, which, come, from, latin, the, first, four, classical, signs, were, described, by, celsus, c, 30, bc, 38, ad, pain, is, due, to, the, release, of, chemicals, such, as, bradykinin, and, histamine, that, stimulate, nerve, endings, acute, inflammation, of, the, lung, usually, as, in, response, to, pneumonia, does, not, cause, pain, unless, the, inflammation, involves, the, parietal, pleura, which, does, have, pain, sensitive, nerve, endings, heat, and, redness, are, due, to, increased, blood, flow, at, body, core, temperature, to, the, inflamed, site, swelling, is, caused, by, accumulation, of, fluid, the, fifth, sign, loss, of, function, is, believed, to, have, been, added, later, by, galen, thomas, sydenham, or, rudolf, virchow, examples, of, loss, of, function, include, pain, that, inhibits, mobility, severe, swelling, that, prevents, movement, having, a, worse, sense, of, smell, during, a, cold, or, having, difficulty, breathing, when, bronchitis, is, present, loss, of, function, has, multiple, causes, the, process, of, acute, inflammation, is, initiated, by, resident, immune, cells, already, present, in, the, involved, tissue, mainly, resident, macrophages, dendritic, cells, histiocytes, kupffer, cells, and, mast, cells, these, cells, possess, surface, receptors, known, as, pattern, recognition, receptors, prrs, which, recognize, i, e, bind, two, subclasses, of, molecules, pathogen, associated, molecular, patterns, pamps, and, damage, associated, molecular, patterns, damps, pamps, are, compounds, that, are, associated, with, various, pathogens, but, which, are, distinguishable, from, host, molecules, damps, are, compounds, that, are, associated, with, host, related, injury, and, cell, damage, at, the, onset, of, an, infection, burn, or, other, injuries, these, cells, undergo, activation, one, of, the, prrs, recognize, a, pamp, or, damp, and, release, inflammatory, mediators, responsible, for, the, clinical, signs, of, inflammation, vasodilation, and, its, resulting, increased, blood, flow, causes, the, redness, rubor, and, increased, heat, calor, increased, permeability, of, the, blood, vessels, results, in, an, exudation, leakage, of, plasma, proteins, and, fluid, into, the, tissue, edema, which, manifests, itself, as, swelling, tumor, some, of, the, released, mediators, such, as, bradykinin, increase, the, sensitivity, to, pain, hyperalgesia, dolor, the, mediator, molecules, also, alter, the, blood, vessels, to, permit, the, migration, of, leukocytes, mainly, neutrophils, and, macrophages, to, flow, out, of, the, blood, vessels, extravasation, and, into, the, tissue, the, neutrophils, migrate, along, a, chemotactic, gradient, created, by, the, local, cells, to, reach, the, site, of, injury, the, loss, of, function, functio, laesa, is, probably, the, result, of, a, neurological, reflex, in, response, to, pain, in, addition, to, cell, derived, mediators, several, acellular, biochemical, cascade, systems, consisting, of, preformed, plasma, proteins, act, in, parallel, to, initiate, and, propagate, the, inflammatory, response, these, include, the, complement, system, activated, by, bacteria, and, the, coagulation, and, fibrinolysis, systems, activated, by, necrosis, e, g, burn, trauma, acute, inflammation, may, be, regarded, as, the, first, line, of, defense, against, injury, acute, inflammatory, response, requires, constant, stimulation, to, be, sustained, inflammatory, mediators, are, short, lived, and, are, quickly, degraded, in, the, tissue, hence, acute, inflammation, begins, to, cease, once, the, stimulus, has, been, removed, chronic, inflammation, is, inflammation, that, lasts, for, months, or, years, macrophages, lymphocytes, and, plasma, cells, predominate, in, chronic, inflammation, in, contrast, to, the, neutrophils, that, predominate, in, acute, inflammation, diabetes, cardiovascular, disease, allergies, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, are, examples, of, diseases, mediated, by, chronic, inflammation, obesity, smoking, stress, and, insufficient, diet, are, some, of, the, factors, that, promote, chronic, inflammation, a, 2014, study, reported, that, 60, of, americans, had, at, least, one, chronic, inflammatory, condition, and, 42, had, more, than, one, common, signs, and, symptoms, that, develop, during, chronic, inflammation, are, as, defined, acute, inflammation, is, an, immunovascular, response, to, inflammatory, stimuli, which, can, include, infection, or, trauma, this, means, acute, inflammation, can, be, broadly, divided, into, a, vascular, phase, that, occurs, first, followed, by, a, cellular, phase, involving, immune, cells, more, specifically, myeloid, granulocytes, in, the, acute, setting, the, vascular, component, of, acute, inflammation, involves, the, movement, of, plasma, fluid, containing, important, proteins, such, as, fibrin, and, immunoglobulins, antibodies, into, inflamed, tissue, upon, contact, with, pamps, tissue, macrophages, and, mastocytes, release, vasoactive, amines, such, as, histamine, and, serotonin, as, well, as, eicosanoids, such, as, prostaglandin, e2, and, leukotriene, b4, to, remodel, the, local, vasculature, macrophages, and, endothelial, cells, release, nitric, oxide, these, mediators, vasodilate, and, permeabilize, the, blood, vessels, which, results, in, the, net, distribution, of, blood, plasma, from, the, vessel, into, the, tissue, space, the, increased, collection, of, fluid, into, the, tissue, causes, it, to, swell, edema, this, exuded, tissue, fluid, contains, various, antimicrobial, mediators, from, the, plasma, such, as, complement, lysozyme, antibodies, which, can, immediately, deal, damage, to, microbes, and, opsonise, the, microbes, in, preparation, for, the, cellular, phase, if, the, inflammatory, stimulus, is, a, lacerating, wound, exuded, platelets, coagulants, plasmin, and, kinins, can, clot, the, wounded, area, using, vitamin, k, dependent, mechanisms, and, provide, haemostasis, in, the, first, instance, these, clotting, mediators, also, provide, a, structural, staging, framework, at, the, inflammatory, tissue, site, in, the, form, of, a, fibrin, lattice, as, would, construction, scaffolding, at, a, construction, site, for, the, purpose, of, aiding, phagocytic, debridement, and, wound, repair, later, on, some, of, the, exuded, tissue, fluid, is, also, funneled, by, lymphatics, to, the, regional, lymph, nodes, flushing, bacteria, along, to, start, the, recognition, and, attack, phase, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, acute, inflammation, is, characterized, by, marked, vascular, changes, including, vasodilation, increased, permeability, and, increased, blood, flow, which, are, induced, by, the, actions, of, various, inflammatory, mediators, vasodilation, occurs, first, at, the, arteriole, level, progressing, to, the, capillary, level, and, brings, about, a, net, increase, in, the, amount, of, blood, present, causing, the, redness, and, heat, of, inflammation, increased, permeability, of, the, vessels, results, in, the, movement, of, plasma, into, the, tissues, with, resultant, stasis, due, to, the, increase, in, the, concentration, of, the, cells, within, blood, a, condition, characterized, by, enlarged, vessels, packed, with, cells, stasis, allows, leukocytes, to, marginate, move, along, the, endothelium, a, process, critical, to, their, recruitment, into, the, tissues, normal, flowing, blood, prevents, this, as, the, shearing, force, along, the, periphery, of, the, vessels, moves, cells, in, the, blood, into, the, middle, of, the, vessel, non, exhaustive, list, the, cellular, component, involves, leukocytes, which, normally, reside, in, blood, and, must, move, into, the, inflamed, tissue, via, extravasation, to, aid, in, inflammation, some, act, as, phagocytes, ingesting, bacteria, viruses, and, cellular, debris, others, release, enzymatic, granules, that, damage, pathogenic, invaders, leukocytes, also, release, inflammatory, mediators, that, develop, and, maintain, the, inflammatory, response, in, general, acute, inflammation, is, mediated, by, granulocytes, whereas, chronic, inflammation, is, mediated, by, mononuclear, cells, such, as, monocytes, and, lymphocytes, various, leukocytes, particularly, neutrophils, are, critically, involved, in, the, initiation, and, maintenance, of, inflammation, these, cells, must, be, able, to, move, to, the, site, of, injury, from, their, usual, location, in, the, blood, therefore, mechanisms, exist, to, recruit, and, direct, leukocytes, to, the, appropriate, place, the, process, of, leukocyte, movement, from, the, blood, to, the, tissues, through, the, blood, vessels, is, known, as, extravasation, and, can, be, broadly, divided, up, into, a, number, of, steps, extravasated, neutrophils, in, the, cellular, phase, come, into, contact, with, microbes, at, the, inflamed, tissue, phagocytes, express, cell, surface, endocytic, pattern, recognition, receptors, prrs, that, have, affinity, and, efficacy, against, non, specific, microbe, associated, molecular, patterns, pamps, most, pamps, that, bind, to, endocytic, prrs, and, initiate, phagocytosis, are, cell, wall, components, including, complex, carbohydrates, such, as, mannans, and, glucans, lipopolysaccharides, lps, peptidoglycans, and, surface, proteins, endocytic, prrs, on, phagocytes, reflect, these, molecular, patterns, with, c, type, lectin, receptors, binding, to, mannans, and, glucans, and, scavenger, receptors, binding, to, lps, upon, endocytic, prr, binding, actin, myosin, cytoskeletal, rearrangement, adjacent, to, the, plasma, membrane, occurs, in, a, way, that, endocytoses, the, plasma, membrane, containing, the, prr, pamp, complex, and, the, microbe, phosphatidylinositol, and, vps34, vps15, beclin1, signalling, pathways, have, been, implicated, to, traffic, the, endocytosed, phagosome, to, intracellular, lysosomes, where, fusion, of, the, phagosome, and, the, lysosome, produces, a, phagolysosome, the, reactive, oxygen, species, superoxides, and, hypochlorite, bleach, within, the, phagolysosomes, then, kill, microbes, inside, the, phagocyte, phagocytic, efficacy, can, be, enhanced, by, opsonization, plasma, derived, complement, c3b, and, antibodies, that, exude, into, the, inflamed, tissue, during, the, vascular, phase, bind, to, and, coat, the, microbial, antigens, as, well, as, endocytic, prrs, phagocytes, also, express, opsonin, receptors, fc, receptor, and, complement, receptor, 1, cr1, which, bind, to, antibodies, and, c3b, respectively, the, co, stimulation, of, endocytic, prr, and, opsonin, receptor, increases, the, efficacy, of, the, phagocytic, process, enhancing, the, lysosomal, elimination, of, the, infective, agent, non, exhaustive, list, specific, patterns, of, acute, and, chronic, inflammation, are, seen, during, particular, situations, that, arise, in, the, body, such, as, when, inflammation, occurs, on, an, epithelial, surface, or, pyogenic, bacteria, are, involved, inflammatory, abnormalities, are, a, large, group, of, disorders, that, underlie, a, vast, variety, of, human, diseases, the, immune, system, is, often, involved, with, inflammatory, disorders, as, demonstrated, in, both, allergic, reactions, and, some, myopathies, with, many, immune, system, disorders, resulting, in, abnormal, inflammation, non, immune, diseases, with, causal, origins, in, inflammatory, processes, include, cancer, atherosclerosis, and, ischemic, heart, disease, examples, of, disorders, associated, with, inflammation, include, atherosclerosis, formerly, considered, a, bland, lipid, storage, disease, actually, involves, an, ongoing, inflammatory, response, recent, advances, in, basic, science, have, established, a, fundamental, role, for, inflammation, in, mediating, all, stages, of, atherosclerosis, from, initiation, through, progression, and, ultimately, the, thrombotic, complications, from, it, these, new, findings, provide, important, links, between, risk, factors, and, the, mechanisms, of, atherogenesis, clinical, studies, have, shown, that, this, emerging, biology, of, inflammation, in, atherosclerosis, applies, directly, to, human, patients, elevation, in, markers, of, inflammation, predicts, outcomes, of, patients, with, acute, coronary, syndromes, independently, of, myocardial, damage, in, addition, low, grade, chronic, inflammation, as, indicated, by, levels, of, the, inflammatory, marker, c, reactive, protein, prospectively, defines, risk, of, atherosclerotic, complications, thus, adding, to, prognostic, information, provided, by, traditional, risk, factors, moreover, certain, treatments, that, reduce, coronary, risk, also, limit, inflammation, in, the, case, of, lipid, lowering, with, statins, the, anti, inflammatory, effect, does, not, appear, to, correlate, with, reduction, in, low, density, lipoprotein, levels, these, new, insights, on, inflammation, contribute, to, the, etiology, of, atherosclerosis, and, the, practical, clinical, applications, in, risk, stratification, and, the, targeting, of, therapy, for, atherosclerosis, an, allergic, reaction, formally, known, as, type, 1, hypersensitivity, is, the, result, of, an, inappropriate, immune, response, triggering, inflammation, vasodilation, and, nerve, irritation, a, common, example, is, hay, fever, which, is, caused, by, a, hypersensitive, response, by, mast, cells, to, allergens, pre, sensitised, mast, cells, respond, by, degranulating, releasing, vasoactive, chemicals, such, as, histamine, these, chemicals, propagate, an, excessive, inflammatory, response, characterised, by, blood, vessel, dilation, production, of, pro, inflammatory, molecules, cytokine, release, and, recruitment, of, leukocytes, severe, inflammatory, response, may, mature, into, a, systemic, response, known, as, anaphylaxis, inflammatory, myopathies, are, caused, by, the, immune, system, inappropriately, attacking, components, of, muscle, leading, to, signs, of, muscle, inflammation, they, may, occur, in, conjunction, with, other, immune, disorders, such, as, systemic, sclerosis, and, include, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and, inclusion, body, myositis, due, to, the, central, role, of, leukocytes, in, the, development, and, propagation, of, inflammation, defects, in, leukocyte, functionality, often, result, in, a, decreased, capacity, for, inflammatory, defense, with, subsequent, vulnerability, to, infection, dysfunctional, leukocytes, may, be, unable, to, correctly, bind, to, blood, vessels, due, to, surface, receptor, mutations, digest, bacteria, ch, diak, higashi, syndrome, or, produce, microbicides, chronic, granulomatous, disease, in, addition, diseases, affecting, the, bone, marrow, may, result, in, abnormal, or, few, leukocytes, certain, drugs, or, exogenous, chemical, compounds, are, known, to, affect, inflammation, vitamin, a, deficiency, for, example, causes, an, increase, in, inflammatory, responses, and, anti, inflammatory, drugs, work, specifically, by, inhibiting, the, enzymes, that, produce, inflammatory, eicosanoids, additionally, certain, illicit, drugs, such, as, cocaine, and, ecstasy, may, exert, some, of, their, detrimental, effects, by, activating, transcription, factors, intimately, involved, with, inflammation, e, g, nf, b, inflammation, orchestrates, the, microenvironment, around, tumours, contributing, to, proliferation, survival, and, migration, cancer, cells, use, selectins, chemokines, and, their, receptors, for, invasion, migration, and, metastasis, on, the, other, hand, many, cells, of, the, immune, system, contribute, to, cancer, immunology, suppressing, cancer, molecular, intersection, between, receptors, of, steroid, hormones, which, have, important, effects, on, cellular, development, and, transcription, factors, that, play, key, roles, in, inflammation, such, as, nf, b, may, mediate, some, of, the, most, critical, effects, of, inflammatory, stimuli, on, cancer, cells, this, capacity, of, a, mediator, of, inflammation, to, influence, the, effects, of, steroid, hormones, in, cells, is, very, likely, to, affect, carcinogenesis, on, the, other, hand, due, to, the, modular, nature, of, many, steroid, hormone, receptors, this, interaction, may, offer, ways, to, interfere, with, cancer, progression, through, targeting, of, a, specific, protein, domain, in, a, specific, cell, type, such, an, approach, may, limit, side, effects, that, are, unrelated, to, the, tumor, of, interest, and, may, help, preserve, vital, homeostatic, functions, and, developmental, processes, in, the, organism, according, to, a, review, of, 2009, recent, data, suggests, that, cancer, related, inflammation, cri, may, lead, to, accumulation, of, random, genetic, alterations, in, cancer, cells, in, 1863, rudolf, virchow, hypothesized, that, the, origin, of, cancer, was, at, sites, of, chronic, inflammation, as, of, 2012, chronic, inflammation, was, estimated, to, contribute, to, approximately, 15, to, 25, of, human, cancers, an, inflammatory, mediator, is, a, messenger, that, acts, on, blood, vessels, and, or, cells, to, promote, an, inflammatory, response, inflammatory, mediators, that, contribute, to, neoplasia, include, prostaglandins, inflammatory, cytokines, such, as, il, 1, tnf, il, 6, and, il, 15, and, chemokines, such, as, il, 8, and, gro, alpha, these, inflammatory, mediators, and, others, orchestrate, an, environment, that, fosters, proliferation, and, survival, inflammation, also, causes, dna, damages, due, to, the, induction, of, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, by, various, intracellular, inflammatory, mediators, in, addition, leukocytes, and, other, phagocytic, cells, attracted, to, the, site, of, inflammation, induce, dna, damages, in, proliferating, cells, through, their, generation, of, ros, and, reactive, nitrogen, species, rns, ros, and, rns, are, normally, produced, by, these, cells, to, fight, infection, ros, alone, cause, more, than, 20, types, of, dna, damage, oxidative, dna, damages, cause, both, mutations, and, epigenetic, alterations, rns, also, cause, mutagenic, dna, damages, a, normal, cell, may, undergo, carcinogenesis, to, become, a, cancer, cell, if, it, is, frequently, subjected, to, dna, damage, during, long, periods, of, chronic, inflammation, dna, damages, may, cause, genetic, mutations, due, to, inaccurate, repair, in, addition, mistakes, in, the, dna, repair, process, may, cause, epigenetic, alterations, mutations, and, epigenetic, alterations, that, are, replicated, and, provide, a, selective, advantage, during, somatic, cell, proliferation, may, be, carcinogenic, genome, wide, analyses, of, human, cancer, tissues, reveal, that, a, single, typical, cancer, cell, may, possess, roughly, 100, mutations, in, coding, regions, 10, 20, of, which, are, driver, mutations, that, contribute, to, cancer, development, however, chronic, inflammation, also, causes, epigenetic, changes, such, as, dna, methylations, that, are, often, more, common, than, mutations, typically, several, hundreds, to, thousands, of, genes, are, methylated, in, a, cancer, cell, see, dna, methylation, in, cancer, sites, of, oxidative, damage, in, chromatin, can, recruit, complexes, that, contain, dna, methyltransferases, dnmts, a, histone, deacetylase, sirt1, and, a, histone, methyltransferase, ezh2, and, thus, induce, dna, methylation, dna, methylation, of, a, cpg, island, in, a, promoter, region, may, cause, silencing, of, its, downstream, gene, see, cpg, site, and, regulation, of, transcription, in, cancer, dna, repair, genes, in, particular, are, frequently, inactivated, by, methylation, in, various, cancers, see, hypermethylation, of, dna, repair, genes, in, cancer, a, 2018, report, evaluated, the, relative, importance, of, mutations, and, epigenetic, alterations, in, progression, to, two, different, types, of, cancer, this, report, showed, that, epigenetic, alterations, were, much, more, important, than, mutations, in, generating, gastric, cancers, associated, with, inflammation, however, mutations, and, epigenetic, alterations, were, of, roughly, equal, importance, in, generating, esophageal, squamous, cell, cancers, associated, with, tobacco, chemicals, and, acetaldehyde, a, product, of, alcohol, metabolism, it, has, long, been, recognized, that, infection, with, hiv, is, characterized, not, only, by, development, of, profound, immunodeficiency, but, also, by, sustained, inflammation, and, immune, activation, a, substantial, body, of, evidence, implicates, chronic, inflammation, as, a, critical, driver, of, immune, dysfunction, premature, appearance, of, aging, related, diseases, and, immune, deficiency, many, now, regard, hiv, infection, not, only, as, an, evolving, virus, induced, immunodeficiency, but, also, as, chronic, inflammatory, disease, even, after, the, introduction, of, effective, antiretroviral, therapy, art, and, effective, suppression, of, viremia, in, hiv, infected, individuals, chronic, inflammation, persists, animal, studies, also, support, the, relationship, between, immune, activation, and, progressive, cellular, immune, deficiency, siv, sm, infection, of, its, natural, nonhuman, primate, hosts, the, sooty, mangabey, causes, high, level, viral, replication, but, limited, evidence, of, disease, this, lack, of, pathogenicity, is, accompanied, by, a, lack, of, inflammation, immune, activation, and, cellular, proliferation, in, sharp, contrast, experimental, siv, sm, infection, of, rhesus, macaque, produces, immune, activation, and, aids, like, disease, with, many, parallels, to, human, hiv, infection, delineating, how, cd4, t, cells, are, depleted, and, how, chronic, inflammation, and, immune, activation, are, induced, lies, at, the, heart, of, understanding, hiv, pathogenesis, one, of, the, top, priorities, for, hiv, research, by, the, office, of, aids, research, national, institutes, of, health, recent, studies, demonstrated, that, caspase, 1, mediated, pyroptosis, a, highly, inflammatory, form, of, programmed, cell, death, drives, cd4, t, cell, depletion, and, inflammation, by, hiv, these, are, the, two, signature, events, that, propel, hiv, disease, progression, to, aids, pyroptosis, appears, to, create, a, pathogenic, vicious, cycle, in, which, dying, cd4, t, cells, and, other, immune, cells, including, macrophages, and, neutrophils, release, inflammatory, signals, that, recruit, more, cells, into, the, infected, lymphoid, tissues, to, die, the, feed, forward, nature, of, this, inflammatory, response, produces, chronic, inflammation, and, tissue, injury, identifying, pyroptosis, as, the, predominant, mechanism, that, causes, cd4, t, cell, depletion, and, chronic, inflammation, provides, novel, therapeutic, opportunities, namely, caspase, 1, which, controls, the, pyroptotic, pathway, in, this, regard, pyroptosis, of, cd4, t, cells, and, secretion, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, such, as, il, 1, and, il, 18, can, be, blocked, in, hiv, infected, human, lymphoid, tissues, by, addition, of, the, caspase, 1, inhibitor, vx, 765, which, has, already, proven, to, be, safe, and, well, tolerated, in, phase, ii, human, clinical, trials, these, findings, could, propel, development, of, an, entirely, new, class, of, anti, aids, therapies, that, act, by, targeting, the, host, rather, than, the, virus, such, agents, would, almost, certainly, be, used, in, combination, with, art, by, promoting, tolerance, of, the, virus, instead, of, suppressing, its, replication, vx, 765, or, related, drugs, may, mimic, the, evolutionary, solutions, occurring, in, multiple, monkey, hosts, e, g, the, sooty, mangabey, infected, with, species, specific, lentiviruses, that, have, led, to, a, lack, of, disease, no, decline, in, cd4, t, cell, counts, and, no, chronic, inflammation, the, inflammatory, response, must, be, actively, terminated, when, no, longer, needed, to, prevent, unnecessary, bystander, damage, to, tissues, failure, to, do, so, results, in, chronic, inflammation, and, cellular, destruction, resolution, of, inflammation, occurs, by, different, mechanisms, in, different, tissues, mechanisms, that, serve, to, terminate, inflammation, include, acute, inflammation, normally, resolves, by, mechanisms, that, have, remained, somewhat, elusive, emerging, evidence, now, suggests, that, an, active, coordinated, program, of, resolution, initiates, in, the, first, few, hours, after, an, inflammatory, response, begins, after, entering, tissues, granulocytes, promote, the, switch, of, arachidonic, acid, derived, prostaglandins, and, leukotrienes, to, lipoxins, which, initiate, the, termination, sequence, neutrophil, recruitment, thus, ceases, and, programmed, death, by, apoptosis, is, engaged, these, events, coincide, with, the, biosynthesis, from, omega, 3, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, of, resolvins, and, protectins, which, critically, shorten, the, period, of, neutrophil, infiltration, by, initiating, apoptosis, as, a, consequence, apoptotic, neutrophils, undergo, phagocytosis, by, macrophages, leading, to, neutrophil, clearance, and, release, of, anti, inflammatory, and, reparative, cytokines, such, as, transforming, growth, factor, 1, the, anti, inflammatory, program, ends, with, the, departure, of, macrophages, through, the, lymphatics, there, is, evidence, for, a, link, between, inflammation, and, depression, inflammatory, processes, can, be, triggered, by, negative, cognitions, or, their, consequences, such, as, stress, violence, or, deprivation, thus, negative, cognitions, can, cause, inflammation, that, can, in, turn, lead, to, depression, in, addition, there, is, increasing, evidence, that, inflammation, can, cause, depression, because, of, the, increase, of, cytokines, setting, the, brain, into, a, sickness, mode, classical, symptoms, of, being, physically, sick, such, as, lethargy, show, a, large, overlap, in, behaviors, that, characterize, depression, levels, of, cytokines, tend, to, increase, sharply, during, the, depressive, episodes, of, people, with, bipolar, disorder, and, drop, off, during, remission, furthermore, it, has, been, shown, in, clinical, trials, that, anti, inflammatory, medicines, taken, in, addition, to, antidepressants, not, only, significantly, improves, symptoms, but, also, increases, the, proportion, of, subjects, positively, responding, to, treatment, inflammations, that, lead, to, serious, depression, could, be, caused, by, common, infections, such, as, those, caused, by, a, virus, bacteria, or, even, parasites, there, is, evidence, for, a, link, between, inflammation, and, delirium, based, on, the, results, of, a, recent, longitudinal, study, investigating, crp, in, covid, 19, patients, an, infectious, organism, can, escape, the, confines, of, the, immediate, tissue, via, the, circulatory, system, or, lymphatic, system, where, it, may, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, body, if, an, organism, is, not, contained, by, the, actions, of, acute, inflammation, it, may, gain, access, to, the, lymphatic, system, via, nearby, lymph, vessels, an, infection, of, the, lymph, vessels, is, known, as, lymphangitis, and, infection, of, a, lymph, node, is, known, as, lymphadenitis, when, lymph, nodes, cannot, destroy, all, pathogens, the, infection, spreads, further, a, pathogen, can, gain, access, to, the, bloodstream, through, lymphatic, drainage, into, the, circulatory, system, when, inflammation, overwhelms, the, host, systemic, inflammatory, response, syndrome, is, diagnosed, when, it, is, due, to, infection, the, term, sepsis, is, applied, with, the, terms, bacteremia, being, applied, specifically, for, bacterial, sepsis, and, viremia, specifically, to, viral, sepsis, vasodilation, and, organ, dysfunction, are, serious, problems, associated, with, widespread, infection, that, may, lead, to, septic, shock, and, death, inflammation, also, is, characterized, by, high, systemic, levels, of, acute, phase, proteins, in, acute, inflammation, these, proteins, prove, beneficial, however, in, chronic, inflammation, they, can, contribute, to, amyloidosis, these, proteins, include, c, reactive, protein, serum, amyloid, a, and, serum, amyloid, p, which, cause, a, range, of, systemic, effects, including, inflammation, often, affects, the, numbers, of, leukocytes, present, in, the, body, with, the, discovery, of, interleukins, il, the, concept, of, systemic, inflammation, developed, although, the, processes, involved, are, identical, to, tissue, inflammation, systemic, inflammation, is, not, confined, to, a, particular, tissue, but, involves, the, endothelium, and, other, organ, systems, chronic, inflammation, is, widely, observed, in, obesity, obese, people, commonly, have, many, elevated, markers, of, inflammation, including, low, grade, chronic, inflammation, is, characterized, by, a, two, to, threefold, increase, in, the, systemic, concentrations, of, cytokines, such, as, tnf, il, 6, and, crp, waist, circumference, correlates, significantly, with, systemic, inflammatory, response, loss, of, white, adipose, tissue, reduces, levels, of, inflammation, markers, as, of, 2017, the, association, of, systemic, inflammation, with, insulin, resistance, and, type, 2, diabetes, and, with, atherosclerosis, was, under, preliminary, research, although, rigorous, clinical, trials, had, not, been, conducted, to, confirm, such, relationships, c, reactive, protein, crp, is, generated, at, a, higher, level, in, obese, people, and, may, increase, the, risk, for, cardiovascular, diseases, the, outcome, in, a, particular, circumstance, will, be, determined, by, the, tissue, in, which, the, injury, has, occurred, and, the, injurious, agent, that, is, causing, it, here, are, the, possible, outcomes, to, inflammation, inflammation, is, usually, indicated, by, adding, the, suffix, itis, as, shown, below, however, some, conditions, such, as, asthma, and, pneumonia, do, not, follow, this, convention, more, examples, are, available, at, list, of, types, of, inflammation
