the, electric, rays, are, a, group, of, rays, flattened, cartilaginous, fish, with, enlarged, pectoral, fins, composing, the, order, torpediniformes, t, r, p, d, n, f, r, m, i, z, they, are, known, for, being, capable, of, producing, an, electric, discharge, ranging, from, 8, to, 220, volts, depending, on, species, used, to, stun, prey, and, for, defense, there, are, 69, species, in, four, families, perhaps, the, best, known, members, are, those, of, the, genus, torpedo, the, torpedo, undersea, weapon, is, named, after, it, the, name, comes, from, the, latin, torpere, to, be, stiffened, or, paralyzed, from, the, effect, on, someone, who, touches, the, fish, electric, rays, have, a, rounded, pectoral, disc, with, two, moderately, large, rounded, angular, not, pointed, or, hooked, dorsal, fins, reduced, in, some, narcinidae, and, a, stout, muscular, tail, with, a, well, developed, caudal, fin, the, body, is, thick, and, flabby, with, soft, loose, skin, with, no, dermal, denticles, or, thorns, a, pair, of, kidney, shaped, electric, organs, are, at, the, base, of, the, pectoral, fins, the, snout, is, broad, large, in, the, narcinidae, but, reduced, in, all, other, families, the, mouth, nostrils, and, five, pairs, of, gill, slits, are, underneath, the, disc, electric, rays, are, found, from, shallow, coastal, waters, down, to, at, least, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, deep, they, are, sluggish, and, slow, moving, propelling, themselves, with, their, tails, not, by, using, their, pectoral, fins, as, other, rays, do, they, feed, on, invertebrates, and, small, fish, they, lie, in, wait, for, prey, below, the, sand, or, other, substrate, using, their, electricity, to, stun, and, capture, it, the, electrogenic, properties, of, electric, rays, have, been, known, since, antiquity, although, their, nature, was, not, understood, the, ancient, greeks, used, electric, rays, to, numb, the, pain, of, childbirth, and, operations, in, his, dialogue, meno, plato, has, the, character, meno, accuse, socrates, of, stunning, people, with, his, puzzling, questions, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, way, the, torpedo, fish, stuns, with, electricity, scribonius, largus, a, roman, physician, recorded, the, use, of, torpedo, fish, for, treatment, of, headaches, and, gout, in, his, compositiones, medicae, of, 46, ad, in, the, 1770s, the, electric, organs, of, the, torpedo, ray, were, the, subject, of, royal, society, papers, by, john, walsh, and, john, hunter, these, appear, to, have, influenced, the, thinking, of, luigi, galvani, and, alessandro, volta, the, founders, of, electrophysiology, and, electrochemistry, henry, cavendish, proposed, that, electric, rays, use, electricity, he, built, an, artificial, ray, consisting, of, fish, shaped, leyden, jars, to, successfully, mimic, their, behaviour, in, 1773, the, torpedo, fish, or, electric, ray, appears, continuously, in, premodern, natural, histories, as, a, magical, creature, and, its, ability, to, numb, fishermen, without, seeming, to, touch, them, was, a, significant, source, of, evidence, for, the, belief, in, occult, qualities, in, nature, during, the, ages, before, the, discovery, of, electricity, as, an, explanatory, mode, the, electric, rays, have, specialised, electric, organs, many, species, of, rays, and, skates, outside, the, family, have, electric, organs, in, the, tail, however, the, electric, ray, has, two, large, kidney, shaped, electric, organs, on, each, side, of, its, head, where, current, passes, from, the, lower, to, the, upper, surface, of, the, body, the, nerves, that, signal, the, organ, to, discharge, branch, repeatedly, then, attach, to, the, lower, side, of, each, plaque, in, the, batteries, these, are, composed, of, hexagonal, columns, closely, packed, in, a, honeycomb, formation, each, column, consists, of, 500, to, more, than, 1000, plaques, of, modified, striated, muscle, adapted, from, the, branchial, gill, arch, muscles, in, marine, fish, these, batteries, are, connected, as, a, parallel, circuit, whereas, freshwater, batteries, are, arranged, in, series, this, allows, freshwater, rays, to, transmit, discharges, of, higher, voltage, as, freshwater, cannot, conduct, electricity, as, well, as, saltwater, with, such, a, battery, an, electric, ray, may, electrocute, larger, prey, with, a, voltage, of, between, 8, volts, in, some, narcinids, to, 220, volts, in, torpedo, nobiliana, the, atlantic, torpedo, the, 60, or, so, species, of, electric, rays, are, grouped, into, 12, genera, and, two, families, the, narkinae, are, sometimes, elevated, to, a, family, the, narkidae, the, torpedinids, feed, on, large, prey, which, are, stunned, using, their, electric, organs, and, swallowed, whole, while, the, narcinids, specialize, on, small, prey, on, or, in, the, bottom, substrate, both, groups, use, electricity, for, defense, but, it, is, unclear, whether, the, narcinids, use, electricity, in, feeding
