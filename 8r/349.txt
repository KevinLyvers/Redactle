see, text, pectenidae, scallop, s, k, l, p, s, k, l, p, is, a, common, name, that, encompasses, various, species, of, marine, bivalve, mollusks, in, the, taxonomic, family, pectinidae, the, scallops, however, the, common, name, scallop, is, also, sometimes, applied, to, species, in, other, closely, related, families, within, the, superfamily, pectinoidea, which, also, includes, the, thorny, oysters, scallops, are, a, cosmopolitan, family, of, bivalves, found, in, all, of, the, world, s, oceans, although, never, in, fresh, water, they, are, one, of, the, very, few, groups, of, bivalves, to, be, primarily, free, living, with, many, species, capable, of, rapidly, swimming, short, distances, and, even, migrating, some, distance, across, the, ocean, floor, a, small, minority, of, scallop, species, live, cemented, to, rocky, substrates, as, adults, while, others, attach, themselves, to, stationary, or, rooted, objects, such, as, seagrass, at, some, point, in, their, lives, by, means, of, a, filament, they, secrete, called, a, byssal, thread, the, majority, of, species, however, live, recumbent, on, sandy, substrates, and, when, they, sense, the, presence, of, a, predator, such, as, a, starfish, they, may, attempt, to, escape, by, swimming, swiftly, but, erratically, through, the, water, using, jet, propulsion, created, by, repeatedly, clapping, their, shells, together, scallops, have, a, well, developed, nervous, system, and, unlike, most, other, bivalves, all, scallops, have, a, ring, of, numerous, simple, eyes, situated, around, the, edge, of, their, mantles, many, species, of, scallops, are, highly, prized, as, a, food, source, and, some, are, farmed, as, aquaculture, the, word, scallop, is, also, applied, to, the, meat, of, these, bivalves, the, adductor, muscle, that, is, sold, as, seafood, the, brightly, coloured, symmetric, fan, shaped, shells, of, scallops, with, their, radiating, and, often, fluted, ornamentation, are, valued, by, shell, collectors, and, have, been, used, since, ancient, times, as, motifs, in, art, architecture, and, design, owing, to, their, widespread, distribution, scallop, shells, are, a, common, sight, on, beaches, and, are, often, brightly, coloured, making, them, a, popular, object, to, collect, among, beachcombers, and, vacationers, the, shells, also, have, a, significant, place, in, popular, culture, scallops, inhabit, all, the, oceans, of, the, world, with, the, largest, number, of, species, living, in, the, indo, pacific, region, most, species, live, in, relatively, shallow, waters, from, the, low, tide, line, to, 100, m, while, others, prefer, much, deeper, water, although, some, species, only, live, in, very, narrow, environments, most, are, opportunistic, and, can, live, under, a, wide, variety, of, conditions, scallops, can, be, found, living, within, upon, or, under, either, rocks, coral, rubble, sea, grass, kelp, sand, or, mud, most, scallops, begin, their, lives, as, byssally, attached, juveniles, an, ability, that, some, retain, throughout, their, lives, while, others, grow, into, free, living, adults, very, little, variation, occurs, in, the, internal, arrangement, of, organs, and, systems, within, the, scallop, family, and, what, follows, can, be, taken, to, apply, to, the, anatomy, of, any, given, scallop, species, the, shell, of, a, scallop, consists, of, two, sides, or, valves, a, left, valve, and, a, right, one, divided, by, a, plane, of, symmetry, most, species, of, scallops, rest, on, their, right, valve, and, consequently, this, valve, is, often, deeper, and, more, rounded, than, the, left, i, e, upper, valve, which, in, many, species, is, actually, concave, with, the, hinge, of, the, two, valves, oriented, towards, the, top, one, side, corresponds, to, the, animal, s, morphological, anterior, or, front, the, other, is, the, posterior, or, rear, the, hinge, is, the, dorsal, or, back, top, region, and, the, bottom, corresponds, to, the, ventral, or, as, it, were, underside, belly, however, as, many, scallop, shells, are, more, or, less, bilaterally, symmetrical, equivalved, as, well, as, symmetrical, front, back, equilateral, determining, which, way, a, given, animal, is, facing, requires, detailed, information, about, its, valves, the, model, scallop, shell, consists, of, two, similarly, shaped, valves, with, a, straight, hinge, line, along, the, top, devoid, of, teeth, and, producing, a, pair, of, flat, wings, or, ears, sometimes, called, auricles, though, this, is, also, the, term, for, two, chambers, in, its, heart, on, either, side, of, its, midpoint, a, feature, which, is, unique, to, and, apparent, in, all, adult, scallops, these, ears, may, be, of, similar, size, and, shape, or, the, anterior, ear, may, be, somewhat, larger, the, posterior, ear, is, never, larger, than, the, anterior, one, an, important, feature, for, distinguishing, which, valve, is, which, as, is, the, case, in, almost, all, bivalves, a, series, of, lines, and, or, growth, rings, originates, at, the, center, of, the, hinge, at, a, spot, called, the, beak, surrounded, by, a, generally, raised, area, called, the, umbo, these, growth, rings, increase, in, size, downwards, until, they, reach, the, curved, ventral, edge, of, the, shell, the, shells, of, most, scallops, are, streamlined, to, facilitate, ease, of, movement, during, swimming, at, some, point, in, their, lifecycles, while, also, providing, protection, from, predators, scallops, with, ridged, valves, have, the, advantage, of, the, architectural, strength, provided, by, these, ridges, called, ribs, although, the, ribs, are, somewhat, costly, in, weight, and, mass, a, unique, feature, of, the, scallop, family, is, the, presence, at, some, point, during, the, animal, s, lifecycle, of, a, distinctive, and, taxonomically, important, shell, feature, a, comb, like, structure, called, a, ctenolium, located, on, the, anterior, edge, of, the, right, valve, next, to, the, valve, s, byssal, notch, though, many, scallops, lose, this, feature, as, they, become, free, swimming, adults, all, scallops, have, a, ctenolium, at, some, point, during, their, lives, and, no, other, bivalve, has, an, analogous, shell, feature, the, ctenolium, is, found, in, modern, scallops, only, both, putative, ancestors, of, modern, scallops, the, entoliids, and, the, aviculopectinidae, did, not, possess, it, like, the, true, oysters, family, ostreidae, scallops, have, a, single, central, adductor, muscle, thus, the, inside, of, their, shells, has, a, characteristic, central, scar, marking, the, point, of, attachment, for, this, muscle, the, adductor, muscle, of, scallops, is, larger, and, more, developed, than, those, of, oysters, because, scallops, are, active, swimmers, some, species, of, scallops, are, known, to, move, en, masse, from, one, area, to, another, in, scallops, the, shell, shape, tends, to, be, highly, regular, and, is, commonly, used, as, an, archetypal, form, of, a, seashell, scallops, possess, fast, striated, and, slow, smooth, adductor, muscles, which, have, different, structures, and, contractile, properties, these, muscles, lie, closely, apposed, to, one, another, but, are, divided, by, a, connective, tissue, sheet, the, striated, adductor, muscle, contracts, very, quickly, for, swimming, whereas, the, smooth, catch, adductor, muscle, lacks, striations, and, contracts, for, long, periods, keeping, shells, closed, with, little, expenditure, of, energy, scallops, are, filter, feeders, and, eat, plankton, unlike, many, other, bivalves, they, lack, siphons, water, moves, over, a, filtering, structure, where, food, particles, become, trapped, in, mucus, next, the, cilia, on, the, structure, move, the, food, toward, the, mouth, then, the, food, is, digested, in, the, digestive, gland, an, organ, sometimes, misleadingly, referred, to, as, the, liver, which, envelops, part, of, the, oesophagus, intestine, and, entire, stomach, waste, is, passed, on, through, the, intestine, the, terminus, of, which, like, that, of, many, mollusks, enters, and, leaves, the, animal, s, heart, and, exits, via, the, anus, p, 20, like, all, bivalves, scallops, lack, actual, brains, instead, their, nervous, system, is, controlled, by, three, paired, ganglia, located, at, various, points, throughout, their, anatomy, the, cerebral, or, cerebropleural, ganglia, the, pedal, ganglia, and, the, visceral, or, parietovisceral, ganglia, all, are, yellowish, the, visceral, ganglia, are, by, far, the, largest, and, most, extensive, of, the, three, and, occur, as, an, almost, fused, mass, near, the, center, of, the, animal, proportionally, these, are, the, largest, and, most, intricate, sets, of, ganglia, of, any, modern, bivalve, from, this, radiate, all, of, the, nerves, which, connect, the, visceral, ganglia, to, the, circumpallial, nerve, ring, which, loops, around, the, mantle, and, connects, to, all, of, the, scallop, s, tentacles, and, eyes, this, nerve, ring, is, so, well, developed, that, in, some, species, it, may, be, legitimately, considered, an, additional, ganglion, p, 46, the, visceral, ganglia, are, also, the, origin, of, the, branchial, nerves, which, control, the, scallop, s, gills, the, cerebral, ganglia, are, the, next, largest, set, of, ganglia, and, lie, distinct, from, each, other, a, significant, distance, dorsal, to, the, visceral, ganglia, they, are, attached, to, the, visceral, ganglia, by, long, cerebral, visceral, connectives, and, to, each, other, via, a, cerebral, commissure, that, extends, in, an, arch, dorsally, around, the, esophagus, the, cerebral, ganglia, control, the, scallop, s, mouth, via, the, palp, nerves, and, connect, to, statocysts, which, help, the, animal, sense, its, position, in, the, surrounding, environment, they, are, connected, to, the, pedal, ganglia, by, short, cerebral, pedal, connectives, the, pedal, ganglia, though, not, fused, are, situated, very, close, to, each, other, near, the, midline, from, the, pedal, ganglia, the, scallop, puts, out, pedal, nerves, which, control, the, movement, of, and, sensation, in, its, small, muscular, foot, pp, 43, 47, scallops, have, a, large, number, up, to, 200, of, small, about, 1, mm, eyes, arranged, along, the, edge, of, their, mantles, these, eyes, represent, a, particular, innovation, among, molluscs, relying, on, a, concave, parabolic, mirror, of, guanine, crystals, to, focus, and, retro, reflect, light, instead, of, a, lens, as, found, in, many, other, eye, types, additionally, their, eyes, possess, a, double, layered, retina, the, outer, retina, responding, most, strongly, to, light, and, the, inner, to, abrupt, darkness, while, these, eyes, are, unable, to, resolve, shapes, with, high, fidelity, the, combined, sensitivity, of, both, retinas, to, light, entering, the, eye, and, light, retro, reflected, from, the, mirror, grants, scallops, exceptional, contrast, definition, as, well, as, the, ability, to, detect, changing, patterns, of, light, and, motion, scallops, primarily, rely, on, their, eyes, as, an, early, warning, threat, detection, system, scanning, around, them, for, movement, and, shadows, which, could, potentially, indicate, predators, additionally, some, scallops, alter, their, swimming, or, feeding, behaviour, based, on, the, turbidity, or, clarity, of, the, water, by, detecting, the, movement, of, particulate, matter, in, the, water, column, scallops, are, mostly, free, living, and, active, unlike, the, vast, majority, of, bivalves, which, are, mostly, slow, moving, and, infaunal, all, scallops, are, thought, to, start, out, with, a, byssus, which, attaches, them, to, some, form, of, substrate, such, as, eelgrass, when, they, are, very, young, most, species, lose, the, byssus, as, they, grow, larger, a, very, few, species, go, on, to, cement, themselves, to, a, hard, substrate, e, g, chlamys, distorta, and, hinnites, multirigosus, however, the, majority, of, scallops, are, free, living, and, can, swim, with, brief, bursts, of, speed, to, escape, predators, mostly, starfish, by, rapidly, opening, and, closing, their, valves, indeed, everything, about, their, characteristic, shell, shape, its, symmetry, narrowness, smooth, and, or, grooved, surface, small, flexible, hinge, powerful, adductor, muscle, and, continuous, and, uniformly, curved, edge, facilitates, such, activity, they, often, do, this, in, spurts, of, several, seconds, before, closing, the, shell, entirely, and, sinking, back, to, the, bottom, of, their, environment, scallops, are, able, to, move, through, the, water, column, either, forward, ventrally, termed, swimming, by, sucking, water, in, through, the, space, between, their, valves, an, area, called, the, gape, and, ejecting, it, through, small, holes, near, the, hinge, line, called, exhalant, apertures, or, backward, dorsally, termed, jumping, by, ejecting, the, water, out, the, same, way, it, came, in, i, e, ventrally, a, jumping, scallop, usually, lands, on, the, sea, floor, between, each, contraction, of, its, valves, whereas, a, swimming, scallop, stays, in, the, water, column, for, most, or, all, of, its, contractions, and, travels, a, much, greater, distance, though, seldom, at, a, height, of, more, than, 1, m, off, the, sea, bed, and, seldom, for, a, distance, of, greater, than, 5, m, both, jumping, and, swimming, movements, are, very, energy, intensive, and, most, scallops, cannot, perform, more, than, four, or, five, in, a, row, before, becoming, completely, exhausted, and, requiring, several, hours, of, rest, should, a, swimming, scallop, land, on, its, left, side, it, is, capable, of, flipping, itself, over, to, its, right, side, via, a, similar, shell, clapping, movement, called, the, righting, reflex, so, called, singing, scallops, are, rumored, to, make, an, audible, soft, popping, sound, as, they, flap, their, shells, underwater, though, whether, or, not, this, happens, is, open, to, some, debate, other, scallops, can, extend, their, foot, from, between, their, valves, and, by, contracting, the, muscles, in, their, foot, they, can, burrow, into, sand, most, species, of, the, scallop, family, are, free, living, active, swimmers, propelling, themselves, through, the, water, through, the, adductor, muscles, to, open, and, close, their, shells, swimming, occurs, through, the, clapping, of, valves, for, water, intake, closing, the, valves, propels, water, with, a, strong, force, near, the, hinge, via, the, velum, a, curtain, like, fold, of, the, mantle, that, directs, water, expulsion, around, the, hinge, scallops, swim, in, the, direction, of, the, valve, opening, unless, the, velum, directs, an, abrupt, change, in, course, direction, other, species, of, scallops, can, be, found, on, the, ocean, floor, attached, to, objects, by, byssal, threads, byssal, threads, are, strong, silky, fibers, extending, from, the, muscular, foot, used, to, attach, to, a, firm, support, such, as, a, rock, some, can, also, be, found, on, the, ocean, floor, moving, with, an, extendable, foot, between, their, valves, or, burrowing, themselves, in, the, sand, by, extending, and, retracting, their, feet, scallops, are, highly, sensitive, to, shadows, vibrations, water, movement, and, chemical, stimuli, all, possess, a, series, of, 100, blue, eyes, embedded, on, the, edge, of, the, mantle, of, their, upper, and, lower, valves, that, can, distinguish, between, light, and, darkness, they, serve, as, a, vital, defense, mechanism, for, avoiding, predators, though, rather, weak, their, series, of, eyes, can, detect, surrounding, movement, and, alert, precaution, in, the, presence, of, predators, most, commonly, sea, stars, crabs, and, snails, physiological, fitness, and, exercise, of, scallops, decrease, with, age, due, to, the, decline, of, cellular, and, especially, mitochondrial, function, thus, increasing, the, risk, of, capture, and, lowering, rates, of, survival, older, individuals, show, lower, mitochondrial, volume, density, and, aerobic, capacity, as, well, as, decreased, anaerobic, capacity, construed, from, the, amount, of, glycogen, stored, in, muscle, tissue, environmental, factors, such, as, changes, in, oxidative, stress, parameters, can, inhibit, the, growth, and, development, of, scallops, seasonal, changes, in, temperature, and, food, availability, have, been, shown, to, affect, muscle, metabolic, capabilities, the, properties, of, mitochondria, from, the, phasic, adductor, muscle, of, euvola, ziczac, varied, significantly, during, their, annual, reproductive, cycle, summer, scallops, in, may, have, lower, maximal, oxidative, capacities, and, substrate, oxidation, than, any, other, time, in, the, year, this, phenomenon, is, due, to, lower, protein, levels, in, adductor, muscles, the, scallop, family, is, unusual, in, that, some, members, of, the, family, are, dioecious, males, and, females, are, separate, while, others, are, simultaneous, hermaphrodites, both, sexes, in, the, same, individual, and, a, few, are, protoandrous, hermaphrodites, males, when, young, then, switching, to, female, female, scallops, have, red, roe, and, male, scallops, have, white, roe, spermatozoa, and, ova, are, released, freely, into, the, water, during, mating, season, and, fertilized, ova, sink, to, the, bottom, after, several, weeks, the, immature, scallops, hatch, and, the, larvae, miniature, transparent, versions, of, the, adults, called, spat, drift, in, the, plankton, until, settling, to, the, bottom, again, an, event, called, spatfall, to, grow, usually, attaching, by, means, of, byssal, threads, some, scallops, such, as, the, atlantic, bay, scallop, argopecten, irradians, are, short, lived, while, others, can, live, 20, years, or, more, age, can, often, be, inferred, from, annuli, the, concentric, rings, of, their, shells, many, scallops, are, hermaphrodites, having, female, and, male, organs, simultaneously, altering, their, sex, throughout, their, lives, while, others, exist, as, dioecious, species, having, a, definite, sex, in, this, case, males, are, distinguished, by, roe, containing, white, testes, and, females, with, roe, containing, orange, ovaries, at, the, age, of, two, they, usually, become, sexually, active, but, do, not, contribute, significantly, to, egg, production, until, four, the, reproduction, process, occurs, externally, through, spawning, in, which, eggs, and, sperm, are, released, into, the, water, spawning, typically, occurs, in, late, summer, and, early, autumn, spring, spawning, may, also, take, place, in, the, mid, atlantic, bight, the, females, of, scallops, are, highly, fecund, capable, of, producing, hundreds, of, millions, of, eggs, per, year, once, an, egg, is, fertilized, it, is, then, planktonic, a, collection, of, microorganisms, that, drift, abundantly, in, fresh, or, salt, water, larvae, stay, in, the, water, column, for, four, to, seven, weeks, before, dissipating, to, the, ocean, floor, where, they, attach, themselves, to, objects, through, byssus, threads, byssus, is, eventually, lost, with, adulthood, transitioning, almost, all, scallop, species, into, free, swimmers, rapid, growth, occurs, within, the, first, several, years, with, an, increase, of, 50, 80, in, shell, height, and, quadrupled, size, in, meat, weight, and, reaches, a, commercial, size, at, about, four, to, five, years, of, age, the, lifespans, of, some, scallops, have, been, known, to, extend, over, 20, years, scallops, are, known, to, be, infected, by, viruses, bacteria, microalgae, of, the, heterokonts, and, dinoflagellates, 71, some, scallops, including, chlamys, hastata, frequently, carry, epibionts, such, as, sponges, and, barnacles, on, their, shells, the, relationship, of, the, sponge, to, the, scallop, is, characterized, as, a, form, of, mutualism, because, the, sponge, provides, protection, by, interfering, with, adhesion, of, predatory, sea, star, tube, feet, camouflages, chlamys, hastata, from, predators, or, forms, a, physical, barrier, around, byssal, openings, to, prevent, sea, stars, from, inserting, their, digestive, membranes, sponge, encrustation, protects, c, hastata, from, barnacle, larvae, settlement, serving, as, a, protection, from, epibionts, that, increase, susceptibility, to, predators, thus, barnacle, larvae, settlement, occurs, more, frequently, on, sponge, free, shells, than, on, sponge, encrusted, shells, in, fact, barnacle, encrustation, negatively, influences, swimming, in, c, hastata, those, swimming, with, barnacle, encrustation, require, more, energy, and, show, a, detectable, difference, in, anaerobic, energy, expenditure, than, those, without, encrustation, in, the, absence, of, barnacle, encrustation, individual, scallops, swim, significantly, longer, travel, further, and, attain, greater, elevation, the, family, name, pectinidae, which, is, based, on, the, name, of, the, type, genus, pecten, comes, from, the, latin, pecten, meaning, comb, in, reference, to, a, comb, like, structure, of, the, shell, which, is, situated, next, to, the, byssal, notch, the, fossil, history, of, scallops, is, rich, in, species, and, specimens, the, earliest, known, records, of, true, scallops, those, with, a, ctenolium, can, be, found, from, the, triassic, period, over, 200, million, years, ago, the, earliest, species, were, divided, into, two, groups, one, with, a, nearly, smooth, exterior, pleuronectis, von, schlotheim, 1820, while, the, other, had, radial, ribs, or, riblets, and, auricles, praechlamys, allasinaz, 1972, fossil, records, also, indicate, that, the, abundance, of, species, within, the, pectinidae, has, varied, greatly, over, time, pectinidae, was, the, most, diverse, bivalve, family, in, the, mesozoic, era, but, the, group, almost, disappeared, completely, by, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, the, survivors, speciated, rapidly, during, the, tertiary, period, nearly, 7, 000, species, and, subspecies, names, have, been, introduced, for, both, fossil, and, recent, pectinidae, the, cladogram, is, based, on, molecular, phylogeny, using, mitochondrial, 12s, 16s, and, nuclear, 18s, 28s, and,

mya, aequipecten, limidae, file, shells, other, pteriomorphia, oysters, mussels, scallops, are, the, family, pectinidae, marine, bivalve, molluscs, within, the, superfamily, pectinoidea, other, families, within, this, same, superfamily, share, a, somewhat, similar, overall, shell, shape, and, some, species, within, some, of, the, related, families, are, also, commonly, referred, to, as, scallops, for, example, propeamussiidae, the, glass, scallops, the, family, pectinidae, is, the, most, diversified, of, the, pectinoideans, in, present, day, oceans, it, is, one, of, the, largest, marine, bivalve, families, and, contains, over, 300, extant, species, in, 60, genera, its, origin, dates, back, to, the, middle, triassic, period, approximately, 240, million, years, ago, in, terms, of, diversity, it, has, been, a, thriving, family, to, the, present, day, evolution, from, its, origin, has, resulted, in, a, successful, and, diverse, group, pectinids, are, present, in, the, world, s, seas, found, in, environments, ranging, from, the, intertidal, zone, to, the, hadal, depths, the, pectinidae, play, an, extremely, important, role, in, many, benthic, communities, and, exhibit, a, wide, range, of, shell, shapes, sizes, sculptures, and, cultures, raines, and, poppe, listed, nearly, 900, species, names, of, scallops, but, most, of, these, are, considered, either, questionable, or, invalid, raines, and, poppe, mentioned, over, 50, genera, around, 250, species, and, subspecies, although, species, are, generally, well, circumscribed, their, attribution, to, subfamilies, and, genera, is, sometimes, equivocal, and, information, about, phylogeny, and, relationships, of, the, species, are, minimal, not, the, least, because, most, work, has, been, based, only, on, adult, morphology, this, family, s, earliest, and, most, comprehensive, taxonomic, treatments, were, based, on, macroscopic, morphological, characters, of, the, adult, shells, and, represent, broadly, divergent, classification, schemes, some, level, of, taxonomic, stability, was, achieved, when, waller, s, studies, in, 1986, 1991, and, 1993, concluded, evolutionary, relationships, between, pectinid, taxa, based, on, hypothesized, morphological, synapomorphies, which, previous, classification, systems, of, pectinidae, failed, to, do, he, created, three, pectinidae, subfamilies, camptonectinidae, chlamydinae, and, pectininae, the, framework, of, its, phylogeny, shows, that, repeated, life, habit, states, derive, from, evolutionary, convergence, and, parallelism, studies, have, determined, the, family, pectinidae, is, monophyletic, developing, from, a, single, common, ancestor, the, direct, ancestors, of, pectinidae, were, scallop, like, bivalves, of, the, family, entoliidae, entoliids, had, auricles, and, a, byssal, notch, only, at, youth, but, they, did, not, have, a, ctenolium, a, comb, like, arrangement, along, the, margins, of, the, byssal, notch, in, pectinidae, the, ctenolium, is, the, defining, feature, of, the, modern, family, pectinidae, and, is, a, characteristic, that, has, evolved, within, the, lineage, in, a, 2008, paper, puslednik, et, al, identified, considerable, convergence, of, shell, morphology, in, a, subset, species, of, gliding, pectinidae, which, suggests, iterative, morphological, evolution, may, be, more, prevalent, in, the, family, than, previously, believed, there, have, been, a, number, of, efforts, to, address, phylogenetic, studies, only, three, have, assessed, more, than, ten, species, and, only, one, has, included, multiple, outgroups, nearly, all, previous, molecular, analyses, of, the, pectinidae, have, only, utilized, mitochondrial, data, phylogenies, based, only, on, mitochondrial, sequence, data, do, not, always, provide, an, accurate, estimation, on, the, species, tree, complicated, factors, can, arise, due, to, the, presence, of, genetic, polymorphisms, in, ancestral, species, and,

are, recognised, in, the, family, pectinidae, the, largest, wild, scallop, fishery, is, for, the, atlantic, sea, scallop, placopecten, magellanicus, found, off, the, northeastern, united, states, and, eastern, canada, scallops, are, harvested, using, scallop, dredges, or, bottom, trawls, most, of, the, rest, of, the, world, s, production, of, scallops, is, from, japan, wild, enhanced, and, aquaculture, and, china, mostly, cultured, atlantic, bay, scallops, p, 661, in, the, d, entrecasteaux, channel, in, the, south, of, tasmania, dredging, was, banned, in, 1969, and, since, then, divers,

fishery, in, new, zealand, declined, from, a, catch, of, 1246, tonnes, in, 1975, to, 41, tonnes, in, 1980, at, which, point, the, government, ordered, the, fishery, closed, spat, seeding, in, the, 1980s, helped, it, recover, and, catches, in, the, 1990s, were, up, to, 684, tonnes, the, tasman, bay, area, was, closed, to, commercial, scallop, harvesting, from, 2009, to, 2011, due, to, a, decline, in, the, numbers, the, commercial, catch, was, down, to, 22, tonnes, in, 2015, and, the, fishery, was, closed, again, the, main, causes, for, the, decline, seem, to, be, fishing, climate, effects, disease, pollutants, and, sediment, runoff, from, farming, and, forestry, forest, and, bird, list, scallops, as, the, worst, choice, in, their, best, fish, guide, for, sustainable, seafood, species, on, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, over, the, last, 100, years, the, populations, of, bay, scallops, have, greatly, diminished, due, to, several, factors, but, probably, mostly, due, to, a, reduction, in, seagrasses, to, which, bay, scallop, spat, attach, caused, by, increased, coastal, development, and, concomitant, nutrient, runoff, another, possible, factor, is, the, reduction, of, sharks, from, overfishing, a, variety, of, sharks, used, to, feed, on, rays, which, are, the, main, predator, of, bay, scallops, with, the, shark, population, reduced, this, apex, predator, in, some, places, almost, eliminated, the, rays, have, been, free, to, feed, on, scallops, to, greatly, decrease, their, numbers, by, contrast, the, atlantic, sea, scallop, placopecten,
