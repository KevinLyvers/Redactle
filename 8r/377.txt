aphaniptera, flea, the, common, name, for, the, order, siphonaptera, includes, 2, 500, species, of, small, flightless, insects, that, live, as, external, parasites, of, mammals, and, birds, fleas, live, by, ingesting, the, blood, of, their, hosts, adult, fleas, grow, to, about, 3, millimetres, 1, 8, inch, long, are, usually, brown, and, have, bodies, that, are, flattened, sideways, or, narrow, enabling, them, to, move, through, their, hosts, fur, or, feathers, they, lack, wings, their, hind, legs, are, extremely, well, adapted, for, jumping, their, claws, keep, them, from, being, dislodged, and, their, mouthparts, are, adapted, for, piercing, skin, and, sucking, blood, they, can, leap, 50, times, their, body, length, a, feat, second, only, to, jumps, made, by, another, group, of, insects, the, superfamily, of, froghoppers, flea, larvae, are, worm, like, with, no, limbs, they, have, chewing, mouthparts, and, feed, on, organic, debris, left, on, their, hosts, skin, genetic, evidence, indicates, that, fleas, are, a, specialised, lineage, of, parasitic, scorpionflies, mecoptera, sensu, lato, most, closely, related, to, the, family, nannochoristidae, the, earliest, known, fleas, lived, in, the, middle, jurassic, modern, looking, forms, appeared, in, the, cenozoic, fleas, probably, originated, on, mammals, first, and, expanded, their, reach, to, birds, each, species, of, flea, specializes, more, or, less, on, one, species, of, host, many, species, of, flea, never, breed, on, any, other, host, some, are, less, selective, some, families, of, fleas, are, exclusive, to, a, single, host, group, for, example, the, malacopsyllidae, are, found, only, on, armadillos, the, ischnopsyllidae, only, on, bats, and, the, chimaeropsyllidae, only, on, elephant, shrews, the, oriental, rat, flea, xenopsylla, cheopis, is, a, vector, of, yersinia, pestis, the, bacterium, that, causes, bubonic, plague, the, disease, was, spread, to, humans, by, rodents, such, as, the, black, rat, which, were, bitten, by, infected, fleas, major, outbreaks, included, the, plague, of, justinian, about, 540, and, the, black, death, about, 1350, each, of, which, killed, a, sizeable, fraction, of, the, world, s, people, fleas, appear, in, human, culture, in, such, diverse, forms, as, flea, circuses, poems, such, as, john, donne, s, erotic, the, flea, works, of, music, such, as, those, by, modest, mussorgsky, and, a, film, by, charlie, chaplin, fleas, are, wingless, insects, 1, 5, to, 3, 3, millimetres, 1, 16, to, 1, 8, inch, long, that, are, agile, usually, dark, colored, for, example, the, reddish, brown, of, the, cat, flea, with, a, proboscis, or, stylet, adapted, to, feeding, by, piercing, the, skin, and, sucking, their, host, s, blood, through, their, epipharynx, flea, legs, end, in, strong, claws, that, are, adapted, to, grasp, a, host, unlike, other, insects, fleas, do, not, possess, compound, eyes, but, instead, only, have, simple, eyespots, with, a, single, biconvex, lens, some, species, lack, eyes, altogether, their, bodies, are, laterally, compressed, permitting, easy, movement, through, the, hairs, or, feathers, on, the, host, s, body, the, flea, body, is, covered, with, hard, plates, called, sclerites, these, sclerites, are, covered, with, many, hairs, and, short, spines, directed, backward, which, also, assist, its, movements, on, the, host, the, tough, body, is, able, to, withstand, great, pressure, likely, an, adaptation, to, survive, attempts, to, eliminate, them, by, scratching, fleas, lay, tiny, white, oval, eggs, the, larvae, are, small, and, pale, have, bristles, covering, their, worm, like, bodies, lack, eyes, and, have, mouth, parts, adapted, to, chewing, the, larvae, feed, on, organic, matter, especially, the, feces, of, mature, fleas, which, contain, dried, blood, adults, feed, only, on, fresh, blood, their, legs, are, long, the, hind, pair, well, adapted, for, jumping, a, flea, can, jump, vertically, up, to, 18, centimetres, 7, inches, and, horizontally, up, to, 33, cm, 13, in, making, the, flea, one, of, the, best, jumpers, of, all, known, animals, relative, to, body, size, second, only, to, the, froghopper, a, flea, can, jump, 60, times, its, length, in, height, and, 110, times, its, length, in, distance, that, s, equivalent, to, a, 1, 8, m, 6, ft, adult, human, jumping, 110, m, 361, ft, vertically, and, 200, m, 656, ft, horizontally, rarely, do, fleas, jump, from, dog, to, dog, most, flea, infestations, come, from, newly, developed, fleas, from, the, pet, s, environment, the, flea, jump, is, so, rapid, and, forceful, that, it, exceeds, the, capabilities, of, muscle, and, instead, of, relying, on, direct, muscle, power, fleas, store, muscle, energy, in, a, pad, of, the, elastic, protein, named, resilin, before, releasing, it, rapidly, like, a, human, using, a, bow, and, arrow, immediately, before, the, jump, muscles, contract, and, deform, the, resilin, pad, slowly, storing, energy, which, can, then, be, released, extremely, rapidly, to, power, leg, extension, for, propulsion, to, prevent, premature, release, of, energy, or, motions, of, the, leg, the, flea, employs, a, catch, mechanism, early, in, the, jump, the, tendon, of, the, primary, jumping, muscle, passes, slightly, behind, the, coxa, trochanter, joint, generating, a, torque, which, holds, the, joint, closed, with, the, leg, close, to, the, body, to, trigger, jumping, another, muscle, pulls, the, tendon, forward, until, it, passes, the, joint, axis, generating, the, opposite, torque, to, extend, the, leg, and, power, the, jump, by, release, of, stored, energy, the, actual, take, off, has, been, shown, by, high, speed, video, to, be, from, the, tibiae, and, tarsi, rather, than, from, the, trochantera, knees, fleas, are, holometabolous, insects, going, through, the, four, lifecycle, stages, of, egg, larva, pupa, and, imago, adult, in, most, species, neither, female, nor, male, fleas, are, fully, mature, when, they, first, emerge, but, must, feed, on, blood, before, they, become, capable, of, reproduction, the, first, blood, meal, triggers, the, maturation, of, the, ovaries, in, females, and, the, dissolution, of, the, testicular, plug, in, males, and, copulation, soon, follows, some, species, breed, all, year, round, while, others, synchronise, their, activities, with, their, hosts, life, cycles, or, with, local, environmental, factors, and, climatic, conditions, flea, populations, consist, of, roughly, 50, eggs, 35, larvae, 10, pupae, and, 5, adults, the, number, of, eggs, laid, depends, on, species, with, batch, sizes, ranging, from, two, to, several, dozen, the, total, number, of, eggs, produced, in, a, female, s, lifetime, fecundity, varies, from, around, one, hundred, to, several, thousand, in, some, species, the, flea, lives, in, the, host, s, nest, or, burrow, and, the, eggs, are, deposited, on, the, substrate, but, in, others, the, eggs, are, laid, on, the, host, itself, and, can, easily, fall, off, onto, the, ground, because, of, this, areas, where, the, host, rests, and, sleeps, become, one, of, the, primary, habitats, of, eggs, and, developing, larvae, the, eggs, take, around, two, days, to, two, weeks, to, hatch, flea, larvae, emerge, from, the, eggs, to, feed, on, any, available, organic, material, such, as, dead, insects, faeces, conspecific, eggs, and, vegetable, matter, in, laboratory, studies, some, dietary, diversity, seems, necessary, for, proper, larval, development, blood, only, diets, allow, only, 12, of, larvae, to, mature, whereas, blood, and, yeast, or, dog, chow, diets, allow, almost, all, larvae, to, mature, another, study, also, showed, that, 90, of, larvae, matured, into, adults, when, the, diet, included, nonviable, eggs, they, are, blind, and, avoid, sunlight, keeping, to, dark, humid, places, such, as, sand, or, soil, cracks, and, crevices, under, carpets, and, in, bedding, the, entire, larval, stage, lasts, between, four, and, 18, days, given, an, adequate, supply, of, food, larvae, pupate, and, weave, silken, cocoons, after, three, larval, stages, within, the, cocoon, the, larva, molts, for, a, final, time, and, undergoes, metamorphosis, into, the, adult, form, this, can, take, just, four, days, but, may, take, much, longer, under, adverse, conditions, and, there, follows, a, variable, length, stage, during, which, the, pre, emergent, adult, awaits, a, suitable, opportunity, to, emerge, trigger, factors, for, emergence, include, vibrations, including, sound, heat, in, warm, blooded, hosts, and, increased, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, all, of, which, may, indicate, the, presence, of, a, suitable, host, large, numbers, of, pre, emergent, fleas, may, be, present, in, otherwise, flea, free, environments, and, the, introduction, of, a, suitable, host, may, trigger, a, mass, emergence, once, the, flea, reaches, adulthood, its, primary, goal, is, to, find, blood, and, then, to, reproduce, female, fleas, can, lay, 5000, or, more, eggs, over, their, life, permitting, rapid, increase, in, numbers, generally, speaking, an, adult, flea, only, lives, for, 2, or, 3, months, without, a, host, to, provide, a, blood, meal, a, flea, s, life, can, be, as, short, as, a, few, days, under, ideal, conditions, of, temperature, food, supply, and, humidity, adult, fleas, can, live, for, up, to, a, year, and, a, half, completely, developed, adult, fleas, can, live, for, several, months, without, eating, so, long, as, they, do, not, emerge, from, their, puparia, optimum, temperatures, for, the, flea, s, life, cycle, are, 21, to, 30, c, 70, to, 86, f, and, optimum, humidity, is, 70, adult, female, rabbit, fleas, spilopsyllus, cuniculi, can, detect, the, changing, levels, of, cortisol, and, corticosterone, hormones, in, the, rabbit, s, blood, that, indicate, it, is, getting, close, to, giving, birth, this, triggers, sexual, maturity, in, the, fleas, and, they, start, producing, eggs, as, soon, as, the, baby, rabbits, are, born, the, fleas, make, their, way, down, to, them, and, once, on, board, they, start, feeding, mating, and, laying, eggs, after, 12, days, the, adult, fleas, make, their, way, back, to, the, mother, they, complete, this, mini, migration, every, time, she, gives, birth, between, 1735, and, 1758, the, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, first, classified, insects, doing, so, on, the, basis, of, their, wing, structure, one, of, the, seven, orders, into, which, he, divided, them, was, aptera, meaning, wingless, a, group, in, which, as, well, as, fleas, he, included, spiders, woodlice, and, myriapods, it, wasn, t, until, 1810, that, the, french, zoologist, pierre, andr, latreille, reclassified, the, insects, on, the, basis, of, their, mouthparts, as, well, as, their, wings, splitting, aptera, into, thysanura, silverfish, anoplura, sucking, lice, and, siphonaptera, fleas, at, the, same, time, separating, off, the, arachnids, and, crustaceans, into, their, own, subphyla, the, group, s, name, siphonaptera, is, zoological, latin, from, the, greek, siphon, a, tube, and, aptera, wingless, it, was, historically, unclear, whether, the, siphonaptera, are, sister, to, the, mecoptera, scorpionflies, and, allies, or, are, inside, that, clade, making, mecoptera, paraphyletic, the, earlier, suggestion, that, the, siphonaptera, are, sister, to, the, boreidae, snow, scorpionflies, is, not, supported, a, 2020, genetic, study, recovered, siphonaptera, within, mecoptera, with, strong, support, as, the, sister, group, to, nannochoristidae, a, small, relictual, group, of, mecopterans, native, to, the, southern, hemisphere, fleas, and, nannochoristids, share, several, similarities, with, each, other, that, are, not, shared, with, other, mecopterans, including, similar, mouthparts, as, well, as, a, similar, sperm, pump, organisation, relationships, of, siphonaptera, per, tihelka, et, al, 2020, diptera, true, flies, boreidae, snow,

scorpionflies, insects, that, are, predators, or, scavengers, fossils, of, large, wingless, stem, group, fleas, with, siphonate, sucking, mouthparts, from, the, middle, jurassic, to, early, cretaceous, have, been, found, in, northeastern, china, and, russia, belonging, to, the, families, saurophthiridae, and, pseudopulicidae, as, well, as, tarwinia, from, the, early, cretaceous, of, australia, most, flea, families, formed, after, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, in, the, paleogene, and, onwards, modern, fleas, probably, arose, in, the, southern, continental, area, of, gondwana, and, migrated, rapidly, northwards, from, there, they, most, likely, evolved, with, mammal, hosts, only, later, moving, to, birds, siphonaptera, is, a, relatively, small, order, of, insects, members, of, the, order, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, and, are, secondarily, wingless, their, ancestors, had, wings, which, modern, forms, have, lost, in, 2005, medvedev, listed, 2005, species, in, 242, genera, and, despite, subsequent, descriptions, of, new, species, bringing, the, total, up, to, around, 2500, species, this, is, the, most, complete, database, available, the, order, is, divided, into, four, infraorders, and, eighteen, families, some, families, are, exclusive, to, a, single, host, group, these, include, the, malacopsyllidae, armadillos, ischnopsyllidae, bats, and, chimaeropsyllidae, elephant, shrews, many, of, the, known, species, are, little, studied, some, 600, species, a, quarter, of, the, total, are, known, from, single, records, over, 94, of, species, are, associated, with, mammalian, hosts, and, only, about, 3, of, species, can, be, considered, to, be, specific, parasites, of, birds, the, fleas, on, birds, are, thought, to, have, originated, from, mammalian, fleas, at, least, sixteen, separate, groups, of, fleas, switched, to, avian, hosts, during, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, siphonaptera, occurrences, of, fleas, on, reptiles, is, accidental, and, fleas, have, been, known, to, feed, on, the, hemolymph, bloodlike, body, fluid, of, ticks, flea, phylogeny, was, long, neglected, the, discovery, of, homologies, with, the, parts, of, other, insects, being, made, difficult, by, their, extreme, specialization, whiting, and, colleagues, prepared, a, detailed, molecular, phylogeny, in, 2008, with, the, basic, structure, shown, in, the, cladogram, the, hectopsyllidae, including, the, harmful, chigoe, flea, or, jigger, is, sister, to, the, rest, of, the, siphonaptera, hectopsyllidae, inc, jigger, pygiopsyllomorpha, macropsyllidae, coptopsyllidae, neotyphloceratini, ctenophthalmini, doratopsyllinae, stephanocircidae, clade, inc, rhopalopsyllidae, ctenophthalmidae, hystrichopsyllidae, chimaeropsyllidae, pulicidae, inc, the, cat, flea, vector, of, bubonic, plague, ceratophyllomorpha, inc, the, ceratophyllidae, such, as, the, widespread, moorhen, flea, as, of, 2023, there, are, 21, recognized, families, within, the, order, siphonaptera, 3, of, which, are, extinct, in, addition, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, the, subfamily, stenoponiinae, should, be, elevated, to, its, own, family, stenoponiidae, fleas, feed, on, a, wide, variety, of, warm, blooded, vertebrates, including, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice, birds, and, sometimes, humans, fleas, normally, specialise, in, one, host, species, or, group, of, species, but, can, often, feed, but, not, reproduce, on, other, species, ceratophyllus, gallinae, affects, poultry, as, well, as, wild, birds, as, well, as, the, degree, of, relatedness, of, a, potential, host, to, the, flea, s, original, host, it, has, been, shown, that, avian, fleas, that, exploit, a, range, of, hosts, only, parasitise, species, with, low, immune, responses, in, general, host, specificity, decreases, as, the, size, of, the, host, species, decreases, another, factor, is, the, opportunities, available, to, the, flea, to, change, host, species, this, is, smaller, in, colonially, nesting, birds, where, the, flea, may, never, encounter, another, species, than, it, is, in, solitary, nesting, birds, a, large, long, lived, host, provides, a, stable, environment, that, favours, host, specific, parasites, although, there, are, species, named, dog, fleas, ctenocephalides, canis, curtis, 1826, and, cat, fleas, ctenocephalides, felis, fleas, are, not, always, strictly, species, specific, a, study, in, virginia, examined, 244, fleas, from, 29, dogs, all, were, cat, fleas, dog, fleas, had, not, been, found, in, virginia, in, more, than, 70, years, and, may, not, even, occur, in, the, us, so, a, flea, found, on, a, dog, is, likely, a, cat, flea, ctenocephalides, felis, one, theory, of, human, hairlessness, is, that, the, loss, of, hair, helped, humans, to, reduce, their, burden, of, fleas, and, other, ectoparasites, in, many, species, fleas, are, principally, a, nuisance, to, their, hosts, causing, an, itching, sensation, which, in, turn, causes, the, host, to, try, to, remove, the, pest, by, biting, pecking, or, scratching, fleas, are, not, simply, a, source, of, annoyance, however, flea, bites, cause, a, slightly, raised, swollen, irritating, nodule, to, form, on, the, epidermis, at, the, site, of, each, bite, with, a, single, puncture, point, at, the, centre, like, a, mosquito, bite, 126, this, can, lead, to, an, eczematous, itchy, skin, disease, called, flea, allergy, dermatitis, which, is, common, in, many, host, species, including, dogs, and, cats, the, bites, often, appear, in, clusters, or, lines, of, two, bites, and, can, remain, itchy, and, inflamed, for, up, to, several, weeks, afterwards, fleas, can, lead, to, secondary, hair, loss, as, a, result, of, frequent, scratching, and, biting, by, the, animal, they, can, also, cause, anemia, in, extreme, cases, 126, fleas, are, vectors, for, viral, bacterial, and, rickettsial, diseases, of, humans, and, other, animals, as, well, as, of, protozoan, and, helminth, parasites, bacterial, diseases, carried, by, fleas, include, murine, or, endemic, typhus, 124, and, bubonic, plague, fleas, can, transmit, rickettsia, typhi, rickettsia, felis, bartonella, henselae, and, the, myxomatosis, virus, 73, they, can, carry, hymenolepiasis, tapeworms, and, trypanosome, protozoans, 74, the, chigoe, flea, or, jigger, tunga, penetrans, causes, the, disease, tungiasis, a, major, public, health, problem, around, the, world, fleas, that, specialize, as, parasites, on, specific, mammals, may, use, other, mammals, as, hosts, thus, humans, may, be, bitten, by, cat, and, dog, fleas, fleas, have, appeared, in, poetry, literature, music, and, art, these, include, robert, hooke, s, drawing, of, a, flea, under, the, microscope, in, his, pioneering, book, micrographia, published, in, 1665, poems, by, donne, and, jonathan, swift, works, of, music, by, giorgio, federico, ghedini, and, modest, mussorgsky, a, play, by, georges, feydeau, a, film, by, charlie, chaplin, and, paintings, by, artists, such, as, giuseppe, crespi, giovanni, battista, piazzetta, and, georges, de, la, tour, john, donne, s, erotic, metaphysical, poem, the, flea, published, in, 1633, after, his, death, uses, the, conceit, of, a, flea, which, has, sucked, blood, from, the, male, speaker, and, his, female, lover, as, an, extended, metaphor, for, their, sexual, relationship, the, speaker, tries, to, convince, a, lady, to, sleep, with, him, arguing, that, if, the, mingling, of, their, blood, in, the, flea, is, innocent, then, sex, would, be, also, the, comic, poem, siphonaptera, was, written, in, 1915, by, the, mathematician, augustus, de, morgan, it, describes, an, infinite, chain, of, parasitism, made, of, ever, larger, and, ever, smaller, fleas, flea, circuses, provided, entertainment, to, nineteenth, century, audiences, these, circuses, extremely, popular, in, europe, from, 1830, onwards, featured, fleas, dressed, as, humans, or, towing, miniature, carts, chariots, rollers, or, cannon, these, devices, were, originally, made, by, watchmakers, or, jewellers, to, show, off, their, skill, at, miniaturization, a, ringmaster, called, a, professor, accompanied, their, performance, with, a, rapid, circus, patter, oriental, rat, fleas, xenopsylla, cheopis, can, carry, the, coccobacillus, yersinia, pestis, the, infected, fleas, feed, on, rodent, vectors, of, this, bacterium, such, as, the, black, rat, rattus, rattus, and, then, infect, human, populations, with, the, plague, as, has, happened, repeatedly, from, ancient, times, as, in, the, plague, of, justinian, in, 541, 542, outbreaks, killed, up, to, 200, million, people, across, europe, between, 1346, and, 1671, the, black, death, pandemic, between, 1346, and, 1353, likely, killed, over, a, third, of, the, population, of, europe, because, fleas, carry, plague, they, have, seen, service, as, a, biological, weapon, during, world, war, ii, the, japanese, army, dropped, fleas, infested, with, y, pestis, in, china, the, bubonic, and, septicaemic, plagues, are, the, most, probable, form, of, the, plague, that, would, spread, as, a, result, of, a, bioterrorism, attack, that, used, fleas, as, a, vector, the, banker, charles, rothschild, devoted, much, of, his, time, to, entomology, creating, a, large, collection, of, fleas, now, in, the, rothschild, collection, at, the, natural, history, museum, london, he, discovered, and, named, the, plague, vector, flea, xenopsylla, cheopis, also, known, as, the, oriental, rat, flea, in, 1903, using, what, was, probably, the, world, s, most, complete, collection, of, fleas, of, about, 260, 000, specimens, representing, some, 73, of, the, 2, 587, species, and, subspecies, so, far, described, he, described, around, 500, species, and, subspecies, of, siphonaptera, he, was, followed, in, this, interest, by, his, daughter, miriam, rothschild, who, helped, to, catalogue, his, enormous, collection, of, the, insects, in, seven, volumes, fleas, have, a, significant, economic, impact, in, america, alone, approximately, 2, 8, billion, is, spent, annually, on, flea, related, veterinary, bills, and, another, 1, 6, billion, annually, for, flea, treatment, with, pet, groomers, four, billion, dollars, is, spent, annually, for, prescription, flea, treatment, and, 348, million, for, flea, pest, control
