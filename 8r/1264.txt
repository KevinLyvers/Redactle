with, specific, specialties, such, as, animal, physiotherapy, or, dentistry, and, species, relevant, roles, such, as, farriers, veterinary, science, helps, human, health, through, the, monitoring, and, control, of, zoonotic, disease, infectious, disease, transmitted, from, nonhuman, animals, to, humans, food, safety, and, through, human, applications, via, medical, research, they, also, help, to, maintain, food, supply, through, livestock, health, monitoring, and, treatment, and, mental, health, by, keeping, pets, healthy, and, long, living, veterinary, scientists, often, collaborate, with, epidemiologists, and, other, health, or, natural, scientists, depending, on, type, of, work, ethically, veterinarians, are, usually, obliged, to, look, after, animal, welfare, veterinarians,

resolved, to, promote, the, study, of, farriery, upon, rational, scientific, principles, physician, james, clark, wrote, a, treatise, entitled, prevention, of, disease, in, which, he, argued, for, the, professionalization, of, the, veterinary, trade, and, the, establishment, of, veterinary, colleges, this, was, finally, achieved, in, 1790, through, the, campaigning, of, granville, penn, who, persuaded, frenchman, benoit, vial, de, st, bel, to, accept, the, professorship, of, the, newly, established, veterinary, college, in, london, the, royal, college, of, veterinary, surgeons, was, established, by, royal, charter, in, 1844, veterinary, science, came, of, age, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, notable, contributions, from, sir, john, mcfadyean, credited, by, many, as, having,

veterinary, physician, usually, called, a, veterinarian, veterinary, surgeon, or, vet, who, has, received, their, doctor, of, veterinary, medicine, degree, this, role, is, the, equivalent, of, a, physician, or, surgeon, medical, doctor, in, human, medicine, and, involves, postgraduate, study, and, qualification, in, many, countries, the, local, nomenclature, for, a, vet, is, a, protected, term, meaning, that, people, without, the, prerequisite, qualifications, and, or, registration, are, not, able, to, use, the, title, and, in, many, cases, the, activities, that, may, be, undertaken, by, a, vet, such, as, animal, treatment, or, surgery, are, restricted, only, to, those, people, who, are, registered, as, vet, for, instance, in, the, united, kingdom, as, in, other, jurisdictions, animal, treatment, may, be, performed, only, by, registered, vets, with, a, few, designated, exceptions, such, as, paraveterinary, workers, calling, oneself, a, vet, without, being, registered, or, performing, any, treatment, is, illegal, most, vets, work, in, clinical, settings, treating, animals, directly, they, may, be, involved, in, a, general, practice, treating, animals, of, all, types, may, be, specialized, in, a, specific, group, of, animals, such, as, companion, animals, livestock, laboratory, animals, zoo, animals, or, horses, or, may, specialize, in, a, narrow, medical, discipline, such, as, veterinary, surgery, dermatology, cardiology, neurology, laboratory, animal, medicine, internal, medicine, and, more, as, healthcare, professionals, vets, face, ethical, decisions, about, the, care, of, their, patients, current, debates, within, the, profession, include, the, veterinary, ethics, of, purely, cosmetic, procedures, on, animals, such, as, declawing, of, cats, docking, of, tails, cropping, of, ears, and, debarking, on, dogs, a, wide, range, of, surgeries, and, operations, is, performed, on, various, types, of, animals, but, not, all, of, them, are, carried, out, by, vets, in, a, case, in, iran, for, instance, an, eye, surgeon, managed, to, perform, a, successful, cataract, surgery, on, a, rooster, for, the, first, time, in, the, world, paraveterinary, workers, including, veterinary, nurses, veterinary, technicians, and, veterinary, assistants, either, assist, vets, in, their, work, or, may, work, within, their, own, scope, of, practice, depending, on, skills, and, qualifications, including, in, some, cases, performing, minor, surgery, the, role, of, paraveterinary, workers, is, less, homogeneous, globally, than, that, of, a, vet, and, qualification, levels, and, the, associated, skill, mix, vary, widely, a, number, of, professions, exist, within, the, scope, of, veterinary, medicine, but, may, not, necessarily, be, performed, by, vets, or, veterinary, nurses, this, includes, those, performing, roles, which, are, also, found, in, human, medicine, such, as, practitioners, dealing, with, musculoskeletal, disorders, including, osteopaths, chiropractors, and, physiotherapists, some, roles, are, specific, to, animals, but, which, have, parallels, in, human, society, such, as, animal, grooming, and, animal, massage, some, roles, are, specific, to, a, species, or, group, of, animals, such, as, farriers, who, are, involved, in, the, shoeing, of, horses, and, in, many, cases, have, a, major, role, to, play, in, ensuring, the, medical, fitness, of, horses, veterinary, research, includes, prevention, control, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, diseases, of, animals, and, basic, biology, welfare, and, care, of, animals, veterinary, research, transcends, species, boundaries, and, includes, the, study, of, spontaneously, occurring, and, experimentally, induced, models, of, both, human, and, animal, diseases, and, research, at, human, animal, interfaces, such, as, food, safety, wildlife, and, ecosystem, health, zoonotic, diseases, and, public, policy, by, value, the, most, important, animal, health, pharmaceutical, supplier, worldwide, is, by, far, zoetis, united, states, as, in, medicine, randomized, controlled, trials, also, are, fundamental, in, veterinary, medicine, to, establish, the, effectiveness, of, a, treatment, clinical, veterinary, research, is, far, behind, human, medical, research, though, with, fewer, randomized, controlled, trials, that, have, a, lower, quality, and, are, mostly, focused, on, research, animals, possible, improvement, consists, in, creation, of, networks, for, inclusion, of, private, veterinary, practices, in, randomized, controlled, trials, although, the, fda, approves, drugs, for, use, in, humans, the, fda, keeps, a, separate, green, book, which, lists, drugs, approved, specifically, for, veterinary, medicine, about, half, of, which, are, separately, approved, for, use, in, humans, no, studies, exist, on, the, effect, of, community, animal, health, services, on, improving, household, wealth, and, the, health, status, of, low, income, farmers, the, first, recorded, use, of, regenerative, stem, cell, therapy, to, treat, lesions, in, a, wild, animal, occurred, in, 2011, in, brazil, on, that, occasion, the, zoo, bras, lia, used, stem, cells, to, treat, a, maned, wolf, who, had, been, run, over, by, a, car, which, was, later, returned, fully, recovered, to, nature
