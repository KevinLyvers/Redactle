aphyocharacinae, aphyoditeinae, bryconinae, characinae, cheirodontinae, gymnocharacinae, heterocharacinae, iguanodectinae, pristellinae, rhoadsiinae, salmininae, stethaprioninae, stevardiinae, tetragonopterinae, and, see, text, characidae, the, characids, or, characins, is, a, family, of, freshwater, subtropical, and, tropical, fish, belonging, to, the, order, characiformes, the, name, characins, is, an, historical, one, but, scientists, today, tend, to, prefer, characids, to, reflect, their, status, as, a, by, and, large, monophyletic, group, at, family, rank, to, arrive, there, this, family, has, undergone, much, systematic, and, taxonomic, change, among, those, fishes, remaining, in, the, characidae, currently, are, the, tetras, comprising, the, very, similar, genera, hemigrammus, and, hyphessobrycon, as, well, as, a, few, related, forms, such, as, the, cave, and, neon, tetras, fish, of, this, family, are, important, as, food, in, several, regions, and, also, constitute, a, large, percentage, of, captive, freshwater, aquarium, fish, species, these, fish, vary, in, length, many, are, less, than, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, one, of, the, smallest, species, hyphessobrycon, roseus, grows, to, a, maximum, length, of, 1, 9, cm, these, fish, inhabit, a, wide, range, and, variety, of, habitats, new, world, fishes, they, originate, in, the, americas, ranging, from, southwestern, texas, and, m, xico, through, most, of, central, and, south, america, including, such, major, waterways, as, the, amazon, and, orinoco, rivers, many, of, these, fish, come, from, rivers, and, tributaries, while, the, blind, cave, tetra, for, example, inhabits, flooded, caves, this, family, has, undergone, a, large, amount, of, systematic, and, taxonomic, change, more, recent, revision, has, moved, many, former, members, of, the, family, into, their, own, related, but, distinct, families, the, pencilfishes, of, the, genus, nannostomus, are, a, typical, example, having, now, been, moved, into, the, lebiasinidae, the, assorted, predatory, species, belonging, to, hoplias, and, hoplerythrinus, have, now, been, moved, into, the, erythrinidae, and, the, sabre, toothed, fishes, of, the, genus, hydrolycus, have, been, moved, into, the, cynodontidae, the, former, subfamily, alestiinae, was, promoted, to, family, level, alestiidae, and, the, subfamilies, crenuchinae, and, characidiinae, were, moved, to, the, family, crenuchidae, other, fish, families, that, were, formerly, classified, as, members, of, the, characidae, but, which, were, moved, into, separate, families, of, their, own, during, recent, taxonomic, revisions, after, 1994, include, acestrorhynchidae, anostomidae, chilodontidae, citharinidae, ctenoluciidae, curimatidae, distichodontidae, gasteropelecidae, hemiodontidae, hepsetidae, parodontidae, prochilodontidae, serrasalmidae, and, triportheidae, the, larger, piranhas, were, originally, classified, as, belonging, to, the, characidae, but, various, revisions, place, them, in, their, own, related, family, the, serrasalmidae, this, reassignment, has, yet, to, enjoy, universal, acceptance, but, is, gaining, in, popularity, among, taxonomists, working, with, these, fishes, given, the, current, state, of, flux, of, the, characidae, a, number, of, other, changes, will, doubtless, take, place, reassigning, once, familiar, species, to, other, families, indeed, the, entire, phylogeny, of, the, ostariophysi, fishes, possessing, a, weberian, apparatus, has, yet, to, be, settled, conclusively, until, that, phylogeny, is, settled, the, opportunity, for, yet, more, upheavals, within, the, taxonomy, of, the, characoid, fishes, is, considerable, spintherobolus, clade, stethaprioninae, stevardiinae, aphyocharacini, cheirodontini, compsurini, exodontini, tetragonopterini, characini, the, subfamilies, and, tribes, currently, recognized, by, most, if, not, all, authors, and, their, respective, genera, are, subfamily, spintherobolus, clade, subfamily, stethaprioninae, subfamily, stevardiinae, subfamily, characinae, subfamily, pristellinae, the, chalceidae, iguanodectidae, bryconidae, and, heterocharacinae, are, the, most, recent, clades, to, be, removed, in, order, to, maintain, a, monophyletic, characidae, subfamily, iguanodectinae, moved, to, iguanodectidae, subfamily, heterocharacinae, moved, to, acestrorhynchidae, subfamily, bryconinae, moved, to, bryconidae, subfamily, salmininae, moved, to, bryconidae, genera, incertae, sedis, a, large, number, of, taxa, in, this, family, are, incertae, sedis, the, relationships, of, many, fish, in, this, family, in, particular, species, traditionally, placed, in, the, tetragonopterinae, which, had, become, something, of, a, wastebin, taxon, are, poorly, known, a, comprehensive, phylogenetic, study, for, the, entire, family, is, needed, the, genera, hyphessobrycon, astyanax, hemigrammus, moenkhausia, and, bryconamericus, include, the, largest, number, of, currently, recognized, species, among, characid, fishes, that, are, in, need, of, revision, astyanax, and, hyphessobrycon, in, the, usual, delimitation, are, among, the, largest, genera, in, this, family, these, genera, were, originally, proposed, between, 1854, and, 1908, and, are, still, more, or, less, defined, as, by, carl, h, eigenmann, in, 1917, though, diverse, species, have, been, added, to, each, genus, since, that, time, the, anatomical, diversity, within, each, genus, the, fact, that, each, of, these, generic, groups, at, the, present, time, cannot, be, well, defined, and, the, high, number, of, species, involved, are, the, major, reasons, for, the, lack, of, phylogenetic, analyses, dealing, with, the, relationships, of, the, species, within, these, generic, groups
