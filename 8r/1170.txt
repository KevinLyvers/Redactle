amanita, muscaria, commonly, known, as, the, fly, agaric, or, fly, amanita, is, a, basidiomycete, of, the, genus, amanita, it, is, a, large, white, gilled, white, spotted, and, usually, red, mushroom, despite, its, easily, distinguishable, features, a, muscaria, is, a, fungus, with, several, known, variations, or, subspecies, these, subspecies, are, slightly, different, some, having, yellow, or, white, caps, but, are, all, usually, called, fly, agarics, most, often, recognizable, by, their, notable, white, spots, recent, dna, fungi, research, however, has, shown, that, some, mushrooms, called, fly, agaric, are, in, fact, unique, species, such, as, a, persicina, the, peach, colored, fly, agaric, native, throughout, the, temperate, and, boreal, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, a, muscaria, has, been, unintentionally, introduced, to, many, countries, in, the, southern, hemisphere, generally, as, a, symbiont, with, pine, and, birch, plantations, and, is, now, a, true, cosmopolitan, species, it, associates, with, various, deciduous, and, coniferous, trees, although, poisonous, death, due, to, poisoning, from, a, muscaria, ingestion, is, quite, rare, parboiling, twice, with, water, weakens, its, toxicity, and, breaks, down, the, mushroom, s, psychoactive, substances, it, is, eaten, in, parts, of, europe, asia, and, north, america, all, a, muscaria, varieties, but, in, particular, a, muscaria, var, muscaria, are, noted, for, their, hallucinogenic, properties, with, the, main, psychoactive, constituents, being, muscimol, and, its, neurotoxic, precursor, ibotenic, acid, a, local, variety, of, the, mushroom, was, used, as, an, intoxicant, and, entheogen, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, siberia, arguably, the, most, iconic, toadstool, species, the, fly, agaric, is, one, of, the, most, recognizable, and, widely, encountered, in, popular, culture, including, in, video, games, for, example, the, frequent, use, of, a, recognizable, a, muscaria, in, the, mario, franchise, e, g, its, super, mushroom, power, up, and, television, for, example, the, houses, in, the, smurfs, franchise, there, have, been, cases, of, children, admitted, to, hospitals, after, consuming, this, poisonous, mushroom, the, children, may, have, been, attracted, to, it, because, of, its, pop, culture, associations, the, name, of, the, mushroom, in, many, european, languages, is, thought, to, derive, from, its, use, as, an, insecticide, when, sprinkled, in, milk, this, practice, has, been, recorded, from, germanic, and, slavic, speaking, parts, of, europe, as, well, as, the, vosges, region, and, pockets, elsewhere, in, france, and, romania, albertus, magnus, was, the, first, to, record, it, in, his, work, de, vegetabilibus, some, time, before, 1256, commenting, vocatur, fungus, muscarum, eo, quod, in, lacte, pulverizatus, interficit, muscas, it, is, called, the, fly, mushroom, because, it, is, powdered, in, milk, to, kill, flies, the, 16th, century, flemish, botanist, carolus, clusius, traced, the, practice, of, sprinkling, it, into, milk, to, frankfurt, in, germany, while, carl, linnaeus, the, father, of, taxonomy, reported, it, from, sm, land, in, southern, sweden, where, he, had, lived, as, a, child, he, described, it, in, volume, two, of, his, species, plantarum, in, 1753, giving, it, the, name, agaricus, muscarius, the, specific, epithet, deriving, from, latin, musca, meaning, fly, it, gained, its, current, name, in, 1783, when, placed, in, the, genus, amanita, by, jean, baptiste, lamarck, a, name, sanctioned, in, 1821, by, the, father, of, mycology, swedish, naturalist, elias, magnus, fries, the, starting, date, for, all, the, mycota, had, been, set, by, general, agreement, as, january, 1, 1821, the, date, of, fries, s, work, and, so, the, full, name, was, then, amanita, muscaria, l, fr, hook, the, 1987, edition, of, the, international, code, of, botanical, nomenclature, changed, the, rules, on, the, starting, date, and, primary, work, for, names, of, fungi, and, names, can, now, be, considered, valid, as, far, back, as, may, 1, 1753, the, date, of, publication, of, linnaeus, s, work, hence, linnaeus, and, lamarck, are, now, taken, as, the, namers, of, amanita, muscaria, l, lam, the, english, mycologist, john, ramsbottom, reported, that, amanita, muscaria, was, used, for, getting, rid, of, bugs, in, england, and, sweden, and, bug, agaric, was, an, old, alternative, name, for, the, species, french, mycologist, pierre, bulliard, reported, having, tried, without, success, to, replicate, its, fly, killing, properties, in, his, work, histoire, des, plantes, v, n, neuses, et, suspectes, de, la, france, 1784, and, proposed, a, new, binomial, name, agaricus, pseudo, aurantiacus, because, of, this, one, compound, isolated, from, the, fungus, is, 1, 3, diolein, 1, 3, di, cis, 9, octadecenoyl, glycerol, which, attracts, insects, it, has, been, hypothesised, that, the, flies, intentionally, seek, out, the, fly, agaric, for, its, intoxicating, properties, an, alternative, derivation, proposes, that, the, term, fly, refers, not, to, insects, as, such, but, rather, the, delirium, resulting, from, consumption, of, the, fungus, this, is, based, on, the, medieval, belief, that, flies, could, enter, a, person, s, head, and, cause, mental, illness, several, regional, names, appear, to, be, linked, with, this, connotation, meaning, the, mad, or, fool, s, version, of, the, highly, regarded, edible, mushroom, amanita, caesarea, hence, there, is, oriol, foll, mad, oriol, in, catalan, mujolo, folo, from, toulouse, concourlo, fouolo, from, the, aveyron, department, in, southern, france, ovolo, matto, from, trentino, in, italy, a, local, dialect, name, in, fribourg, in, switzerland, is, tsapi, de, diablhou, which, translates, as, devil, s, hat, amanita, muscaria, is, the, type, species, of, the, genus, by, extension, it, is, also, the, type, species, of, amanita, subgenus, amanita, as, well, as, section, amanita, within, this, subgenus, amanita, subgenus, amanita, includes, all, amanita, with, inamyloid, spores, amanita, section, amanita, includes, the, species, with, patchy, universal, veil, remnants, including, a, volva, that, is, reduced, to, a, series, of, concentric, rings, and, the, veil, remnants, on, the, cap, to, a, series, of, patches, or, warts, most, species, in, this, group, also, have, a, bulbous, base, amanita, section, amanita, consists, of, a, muscaria, and, its, close, relatives, including, a, pantherina, the, panther, cap, a, gemmata, a, farinosa, and, a, xanthocephala, modern, fungal, taxonomists, have, classified, amanita, muscaria, and, its, allies, this, way, based, on, gross, morphology, and, spore, inamyloidy, two, recent, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, have, confirmed, this, classification, as, natural, a, large, conspicuous, mushroom, amanita, muscaria, is, generally, common, and, numerous, where, it, grows, and, is, often, found, in, groups, with, basidiocarps, in, all, stages, of, development, fly, agaric, fruiting, bodies, emerge, from, the, soil, looking, like, white, eggs, after, emerging, from, the, ground, the, cap, is, covered, with, numerous, small, white, to, yellow, pyramid, shaped, warts, these, are, remnants, of, the, universal, veil, a, membrane, that, encloses, the, entire, mushroom, when, it, is, still, very, young, dissecting, the, mushroom, at, this, stage, reveals, a, characteristic, yellowish, layer, of, skin, under, the, veil, which, helps, identification, as, the, fungus, grows, the, red, colour, appears, through, the, broken, veil, and, the, warts, become, less, prominent, they, do, not, change, in, size, but, are, reduced, relative, to, the, expanding, skin, area, the, cap, changes, from, globose, to, hemispherical, and, finally, to, plate, like, and, flat, in, mature, specimens, fully, grown, the, bright, red, cap, is, usually, around, 8, 20, centimetres, 3, 8, inches, in, diameter, although, larger, specimens, have, been, found, the, red, colour, may, fade, after, rain, and, in, older, mushrooms, the, free, gills, are, white, as, is, the, spore, print, the, oval, spores, measure, 9, 13, by, 6, 5, 9, m, they, do, not, turn, blue, with, the, application, of, iodine, the, stipe, is, white, 5, 20, cm, 2, 8, in, high, by, 1, 2, cm, 1, 2, 1, in, wide, and, has, the, slightly, brittle, fibrous, texture, typical, of, many, large, mushrooms, at, the, base, is, a, bulb, that, bears, universal, veil, remnants, in, the, form, of, two, to, four, distinct, rings, or, ruffs, between, the, basal, universal, veil, remnants, and, gills, are, remnants, of, the, partial, veil, which, covers, the, gills, during, development, in, the, form, of, a, white, ring, it, can, be, quite, wide, and, flaccid, with, age, there, is, generally, no, associated, smell, other, than, a, mild, earthiness, although, very, distinctive, in, appearance, the, fly, agaric, has, been, mistaken, for, other, yellow, to, red, mushroom, species, in, the, americas, such, as, armillaria, cf, mellea, and, the, edible, a, basii, a, mexican, species, similar, to, a, caesarea, of, europe, poison, control, centres, in, the, u, s, and, canada, have, become, aware, that, amarill, spanish, for, yellow, is, a, common, name, for, the, a, caesarea, like, species, in, mexico, a, caesarea, is, distinguished, by, its, entirely, orange, to, red, cap, which, lacks, the, numerous, white, warty, spots, of, the, fly, agaric, though, these, sometimes, wash, away, during, heavy, rain, furthermore, the, stem, gills, and, ring, of, a, caesarea, are, bright, yellow, not, white, the, volva, is, a, distinct, white, bag, not, broken, into, scales, in, australia, the, introduced, fly, agaric, may, be, confused, with, the, native, vermilion, grisette, amanita, xanthocephala, which, grows, in, association, with, eucalypts, the, latter, species, generally, lacks, the, white, warts, of, a, muscaria, and, bears, no, ring, additionally, immature, button, forms, resemble, puffballs, amanita, muscaria, varies, considerably, in, its, morphology, and, many, authorities, recognize, several, subspecies, or, varieties, within, the, species, in, the, agaricales, in, modern, taxonomy, german, mycologist, rolf, singer, listed, three, subspecies, though, without, description, a, muscaria, ssp, muscaria, a, muscaria, ssp, americana, and, a, muscaria, ssp, flavivolvata, however, a, 2006, molecular, phylogenetic, study, of, different, regional, populations, of, a, muscaria, by, mycologist, j, zsef, geml, and, colleagues, found, three, distinct, clades, within, this, species, representing, roughly, eurasian, eurasian, subalpine, and, north, american, populations, specimens, belonging, to, all, three, clades, have, been, found, in, alaska, this, has, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, this, was, the, centre, of, diversification, for, this, species, the, study, also, looked, at, four, named, varieties, of, the, species, var, alba, var, flavivolvata, var, formosa, including, var, guessowii, and, var, regalis, from, both, areas, all, four, varieties, were, found, within, both, the, eurasian, and, north, american, clades, evidence, that, these, morphological, forms, are, polymorphisms, rather, than, distinct, subspecies, or, varieties, further, molecular, study, by, geml, and, colleagues, published, in, 2008, show, that, these, three, genetic, groups, plus, a, fourth, associated, with, oak, hickory, pine, forest, in, the, southeastern, united, states, and, two, more, on, santa, cruz, island, in, california, are, delineated, from, each, other, enough, genetically, to, be, considered, separate, species, thus, a, muscaria, as, it, stands, currently, is, evidently, a, species, complex, the, complex, also, includes, at, least, three, other, closely, related, taxa, that, are, currently, regarded, as, species, a, breckonii, is, a, buff, capped, mushroom, associated, with, conifers, from, the, pacific, northwest, and, the, brown, capped, a, gioiosa, and, a, heterochroma, from, the, mediterranean, basin, and, from, sardinia, respectively, both, of, these, last, two, are, found, with, eucalyptus, and, cistus, trees, and, it, is, unclear, whether, they, are, native, or, introduced, from, australia, amanitaceae, org, lists, four, varieties, as, of, may, 2019, but, says, that, they, will, be, segregated, into, their, own, taxa, in, the, near, future, they, are, known, to, be, toxic, but, used, by, shamans, in, northern, cultures, associated, predominantly, with, birch, and, diverse, conifers, in, forest, a, muscaria, is, a, cosmopolitan, mushroom, native, to, conifer, and, deciduous, woodlands, throughout, the, temperate, and, boreal, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, including, higher, elevations, of, warmer, latitudes, in, regions, such, as, hindu, kush, the, mediterranean, and, also, central, america, a, recent, molecular, study, proposes, that, it, had, an, ancestral, origin, in, the, siberian, beringian, region, in, the, tertiary, period, before, radiating, outwards, across, asia, europe, and, north, america, the, season, for, fruiting, varies, in, different, climates, fruiting, occurs, in, summer, and, autumn, across, most, of, north, america, but, later, in, autumn, and, early, winter, on, the, pacific, coast, this, species, is, often, found, in, similar, locations, to, boletus, edulis, and, may, appear, in, fairy, rings, conveyed, with, pine, seedlings, it, has, been, widely, transported, into, the, southern, hemisphere, including, australia, new, zealand, south, africa, and, south, america, where, it, can, be, found, in, the, brazilian, states, of, paran, s, o, paulo, minas, gerais, rio, grande, do, sul, ectomycorrhizal, a, muscaria, forms, symbiotic, relationships, with, many, trees, including, pine, oak, spruce, fir, birch, and, cedar, commonly, seen, under, introduced, trees, a, muscaria, is, the, fungal, equivalent, of, a, weed, in, new, zealand, tasmania, and, victoria, forming, new, associations, with, southern, beech, nothofagus, the, species, is, also, invading, a, rainforest, in, australia, where, it, may, be, displacing, the, native, species, it, appears, to, be, spreading, northwards, with, recent, reports, placing, it, near, port, macquarie, on, the, new, south, wales, north, coast, it, was, recorded, under, silver, birch, betula, pendula, in, manjimup, western, australia, in, 2010, although, it, has, apparently, not, spread, to, eucalypts, in, australia, it, has, been, recorded, associating, with, them, in, portugal, commonly, found, throughout, the, great, southern, region, of, western, australia, it, is, regularly, found, growing, on, pinus, radiata, a, muscaria, poisoning, has, occurred, in, young, children, and, in, people, who, ingested, the, mushrooms, for, a, hallucinogenic, experience, or, who, confused, it, with, an, edible, species, a, muscaria, contains, several, biologically, active, agents, at, least, one, of, which, muscimol, is, known, to, be, psychoactive, ibotenic, acid, a, neurotoxin, serves, as, a, prodrug, to, muscimol, with, a, small, amount, likely, converting, to, muscimol, after, ingestion, an, active, dose, in, adults, is, approximately, 6, mg, muscimol, or, 30, to, 60, mg, ibotenic, acid, this, is, typically, about, the, amount, found, in, one, cap, of, amanita, muscaria, the, amount, and, ratio, of, chemical, compounds, per, mushroom, varies, widely, from, region, to, region, and, season, to, season, which, can, further, confuse, the, issue, spring, and, summer, mushrooms, have, been, reported, to, contain, up, to, 10, times, more, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, than, autumn, fruitings, deaths, from, a, muscaria, have, been, reported, in, historical, journal, articles, and, newspaper, reports, but, with, modern, medical, treatment, fatal, poisoning, from, ingesting, this, mushroom, is, extremely, rare, many, books, list, a, muscaria, as, deadly, but, according, to, david, arora, this, is, an, error, that, implies, the, mushroom, is, far, more, toxic, than, it, is, furthermore, the, north, american, mycological, association, has, stated, that, there, were, no, reliably, documented, cases, of, death, from, toxins, in, these, mushrooms, in, the, past, 100, years, the, active, constituents, of, this, species, are, water, soluble, and, boiling, and, then, discarding, the, cooking, water, at, least, partly, detoxifies, a, muscaria, drying, may, increase, potency, as, the, process, facilitates, the, conversion, of, ibotenic, acid, to, the, more, potent, muscimol, according, to, some, sources, once, detoxified, the, mushroom, becomes, edible, patrick, harding, describes, the, sami, custom, of, processing, the, fly, agaric, through, reindeer, muscarine, discovered, in, 1869, was, long, thought, to, be, the, active, hallucinogenic, agent, in, a, muscaria, muscarine, binds, with, muscarinic, acetylcholine, receptors, leading, to, the, excitation, of, neurons, bearing, these, receptors, the, levels, of, muscarine, in, amanita, muscaria, are, minute, when, compared, with, other, poisonous, fungi, such, as, inosperma, erubescens, the, small, white, clitocybe, species, c, dealbata, and, c, rivulosa, the, level, of, muscarine, in, a, muscaria, is, too, low, to, play, a, role, in, the, symptoms, of, poisoning, the, major, toxins, involved, in, a, muscaria, poisoning, are, muscimol, 3, hydroxy, 5, aminomethyl, 1, isoxazole, an, unsaturated, cyclic, hydroxamic, acid, and, the, related, amino, acid, ibotenic, acid, muscimol, is, the, product, of, the, decarboxylation, usually, by, drying, of, ibotenic, acid, muscimol, and, ibotenic, acid, were, discovered, in, the, mid, 20th, century, researchers, in, england, japan, and, switzerland, showed, that, the, effects, produced, were, due, mainly, to, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, not, muscarine, these, toxins, are, not, distributed, uniformly, in, the, mushroom, most, are, detected, in, the, cap, of, the, fruit, a, moderate, amount, in, the, base, with, the, smallest, amount, in, the, stalk, quite, rapidly, between, 20, and, 90, minutes, after, ingestion, a, substantial, fraction, of, ibotenic, acid, is, excreted, unmetabolised, in, the, urine, of, the, consumer, almost, no, muscimol, is, excreted, when, pure, ibotenic, acid, is, eaten, but, muscimol, is, detectable, in, the, urine, after, eating, a, muscaria, which, contains, both, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, are, structurally, related, to, each, other, and, to, two, major, neurotransmitters, of, the, central, nervous, system, glutamic, acid, and, gaba, respectively, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, act, like, these, neurotransmitters, muscimol, being, a, potent, gaba, a, agonist, while, ibotenic, acid, is, an, agonist, of, nmda, glutamate, receptors, and, certain, metabotropic, glutamate, receptors, which, are, involved, in, the, control, of, neuronal, activity, it, is, these, interactions, which, are, thought, to, cause, the, psychoactive, effects, found, in, intoxication, muscazone, is, another, compound, that, has, more, recently, been, isolated, from, european, specimens, of, the, fly, agaric, it, is, a, product, of, the, breakdown, of, ibotenic, acid, by, ultra, violet, radiation, muscazone, is, of, minor, pharmacological, activity, compared, with, the, other, agents, amanita, muscaria, and, related, species, are, known, as, effective, bioaccumulators, of, vanadium, some, species, concentrate, vanadium, to, levels, of, up, to, 400, times, those, typically, found, in, plants, vanadium, is, present, in, fruit, bodies, as, an, organometallic, compound, called, amavadine, the, biological, importance, of, the, accumulation, process, is, unknown, fly, agarics, are, best, known, for, the, unpredictability, of, their, effects, depending, on, habitat, and, the, amount, ingested, per, body, weight, effects, can, range, from, mild, nausea, and, twitching, to, drowsiness, cholinergic, crisis, like, effects, low, blood, pressure, sweating, and, salivation, auditory, and, visual, distortions, mood, changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and, loss, of, equilibrium, like, with, tetanus, in, cases, of, serious, poisoning, the, mushroom, causes, delirium, somewhat, similar, in, effect, to, anticholinergic, poisoning, such, as, that, caused, by, datura, stramonium, characterised, by, bouts, of, marked, agitation, with, confusion, hallucinations, and, irritability, followed, by, periods, of, central, nervous, system, depression, seizures, and, coma, may, also, occur, in, severe, poisonings, symptoms, typically, appear, after, around, 30, to, 90, minutes, and, peak, within, three, hours, but, certain, effects, can, last, for, several, days, in, the, majority, of, cases, recovery, is, complete, within, 12, to, 24, hours, the, effect, is, highly, variable, between, individuals, with, similar, doses, potentially, causing, quite, different, reactions, some, people, suffering, intoxication, have, exhibited, headaches, up, to, ten, hours, afterwards, retrograde, amnesia, and, somnolence, can, result, following, recovery, medical, attention, should, be, sought, in, cases, of, suspected, poisoning, if, the, delay, between, ingestion, and, treatment, is, less, than, four, hours, activated, charcoal, is, given, gastric, lavage, can, be, considered, if, the, patient, presents, within, one, hour, of, ingestion, inducing, vomiting, with, syrup, of, ipecac, is, no, longer, recommended, in, any, poisoning, situation, there, is, no, antidote, and, supportive, care, is, the, mainstay, of, further, treatment, for, intoxication, though, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, deliriant, and, while, muscarine, was, first, isolated, from, a, muscaria, and, as, such, is, its, namesake, muscimol, does, not, have, action, either, as, an, agonist, or, antagonist, at, the, muscarinic, acetylcholine, receptor, site, and, therefore, atropine, or, physostigmine, as, an, antidote, is, not, recommended, if, a, patient, is, delirious, or, agitated, this, can, usually, be, treated, by, reassurance, and, if, necessary, physical, restraints, a, benzodiazepine, such, as, diazepam, or, lorazepam, can, be, used, to, control, combativeness, agitation, muscular, overactivity, and, seizures, only, small, doses, should, be, used, as, they, may, worsen, the, respiratory, depressant, effects, of, muscimol, recurrent, vomiting, is, rare, but, if, present, may, lead, to, fluid, and, electrolyte, imbalances, intravenous, rehydration, or, electrolyte, replacement, may, be, required, serious, cases, may, develop, loss, of, consciousness, or, coma, and, may, need, intubation, and, artificial, ventilation, hemodialysis, can, remove, the, toxins, although, this, intervention, is, generally, considered, unnecessary, with, modern, medical, treatment, the, prognosis, is, typically, good, following, supportive, treatment, the, wide, range, of, psychoactive, effects, have, been, variously, described, as, depressant, sedative, hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, or, deliriant, paradoxical, effects, such, as, stimulation, may, occur, however, perceptual, phenomena, such, as, synesthesia, macropsia, and, micropsia, may, occur, the, latter, two, effects, may, occur, either, simultaneously, or, alternatingly, as, part, of, alice, in, wonderland, syndrome, collectively, known, as, dysmetropsia, along, with, related, distortions, pelopsia, and, teleopsia, some, users, report, lucid, dreaming, under, the, influence, of, its, hypnotic, effects, unlike, psilocybe, cubensis, a, muscaria, cannot, be, commercially, cultivated, due, to, its, mycorrhizal, relationship, with, the, roots, of, pine, trees, however, following, the, outlawing, of, psilocybin, mushrooms, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 2006, the, sale, of, the, still, legal, a, muscaria, began, increasing, marija, gimbutas, reported, to, r, gordon, wasson, that, in, remote, areas, of, lithuania, a, muscaria, has, been, consumed, at, wedding, feasts, in, which, mushrooms, were, mixed, with, vodka, she, also, reported, that, the, lithuanians, used, to, export, a, muscaria, to, the, sami, in, the, far, north, for, use, in, shamanic, rituals, the, lithuanian, festivities, are, the, only, report, that, wasson, received, of, ingestion, of, fly, agaric, for, religious, use, in, eastern, europe, a, muscaria, was, widely, used, as, an, entheogen, by, many, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, siberia, its, use, was, known, among, almost, all, of, the, uralic, speaking, peoples, of, western, siberia, and, the, paleosiberian, speaking, peoples, of, the, russian, far, east, there, are, only, isolated, reports, of, a, muscaria, use, among, the, tungusic, and, turkic, peoples, of, central, siberia, and, it, is, believed, that, on, the, whole, entheogenic, use, of, a, muscaria, was, not, practised, by, these, peoples, in, western, siberia, the, use, of, a, muscaria, was, restricted, to, shamans, who, used, it, as, an, alternative, method, of, achieving, a, trance, state, normally, siberian, shamans, achieve, trance, by, prolonged, drumming, and, dancing, in, eastern, siberia, a, muscaria, was, used, by, both, shamans, and, laypeople, alike, and, was, used, recreationally, as, well, as, religiously, in, eastern, siberia, the, shaman, would, take, the, mushrooms, and, others, would, drink, his, urine, this, urine, still, containing, psychoactive, elements, may, be, more, potent, than, the, a, muscaria, mushrooms, with, fewer, negative, effects, such, as, sweating, and, twitching, suggesting, that, the, initial, user, may, act, as, a, screening, filter, for, other, components, in, the, mushroom, the, koryak, of, eastern, siberia, have, a, story, about, the, fly, agaric, wapaq, which, enabled, big, raven, to, carry, a, whale, to, its, home, in, the, story, the, deity, vahiyinin, existence, spat, onto, earth, and, his, spittle, became, the, wapaq, and, his, saliva, becomes, the, warts, after, experiencing, the, power, of, the, wapaq, raven, was, so, exhilarated, that, he, told, it, to, grow, forever, on, earth, so, his, children, the, people, could, learn, from, it, among, the, koryaks, one, report, said, that, the, poor, would, consume, the, urine, of, the, wealthy, who, could, afford, to, buy, the, mushrooms, it, was, reported, that, the, local, reindeer, would, often, follow, an, individual, intoxicated, by, the, muscimol, mushroom, and, if, said, individual, were, to, urinate, in, snow, the, reindeer, would, become, similarly, intoxicated, and, the, koryak, people, s, would, use, the, drunken, state, of, the, reindeer, to, more, easily, rope, and, hunt, them, as, a, result, of, a, lack, of, regulation, the, use, of, amanita, muscaria, as, a, popular, legal, alternative, to, hallucinogens, has, grown, exponentially, in, recent, years, in, 2024, google, searches, for, amanita, muscaria, rose, nearly, 200, from, the, previous, year, a, trend, that, an, article, published, in, the, american, journal, of, preventative, medicine, correlated, with, the, sudden, commercialization, of, amanita, muscaria, products, on, the, internet, while, amanita, mushrooms, are, unscheduled, in, the, united, states, the, sale, of, amanita, products, exists, in, a, legal, gray, area, as, they, are, listed, as, a, poison, by, the, fda, and, are, not, approved, to, be, used, in, dietary, supplements, with, some, drawing, comparisons, to, the, controversial, legal, status, of, hemp, derived, cannabinoids, a, recent, outbreak, of, poisonings, and, at, least, one, death, associated, with, products, containing, amanita, muscaria, extracts, has, sparked, debates, regarding, the, regulatory, status, of, amanita, mushrooms, and, their, psychoactive, constituents, these, products, often, use, misleading, advertising, such, as, erroneous, comparisons, to, psilocybin, mushrooms, or, simply, not, disclosing, the, inclusion, of, amanita, mushrooms, on, the, packaging, the, finnish, historian, t, i, itkonen, mentions, that, a, muscaria, was, once, used, among, the, s, mi, peoples, sorcerers, in, inari, would, consume, fly, agarics, with, seven, spots, in, 1979, said, gholam, mochtar, and, hartmut, geerken, published, an, article, in, which, they, claimed, to, have, discovered, a, tradition, of, medicinal, and, recreational, use, of, this, mushroom, among, a, parachi, speaking, group, in, afghanistan, there, are, also, unconfirmed, reports, of, religious, use, of, a, muscaria, among, two, subarctic, native, american, tribes, ojibwa, ethnobotanist, keewaydinoquay, peschel, reported, its, use, among, her, people, where, it, was, known, as, miskwedo, an, abbreviation, of, the, name, oshtimisk, wajashkwedo, red, top, mushroom, this, information, was, enthusiastically, received, by, wasson, although, evidence, from, other, sources, was, lacking, there, is, also, one, account, of, a, euro, american, who, claims, to, have, been, initiated, into, traditional, tlicho, use, of, amanita, muscaria, the, flying, reindeer, of, santa, claus, who, is, called, joulupukki, in, finland, could, symbolize, the, use, of, a, muscaria, by, s, mi, shamans, however, s, mi, scholars, and, the, s, mi, peoples, themselves, refute, any, connection, between, santa, claus, and, s, mi, history, or, culture, the, story, of, santa, emerging, from, a, s, mi, shamanic, tradition, has, a, critical, number, of, flaws, asserts, tim, frandy, assistant, professor, of, nordic, studies, at, the, university, of, british, columbia, and, a, member, of, the, s, mi, descendent, community, in, north, america, the, theory, has, been, widely, criticized, by, s, mi, people, as, a, stereotypical, and, problematic, romanticized, misreading, of, actual, s, mi, culture, the, notion, that, vikings, used, a, muscaria, to, produce, their, berserker, rages, was, first, suggested, by, the, swedish, professor, samuel, dmann, in, 1784, dmann, based, his, theories, on, reports, about, the, use, of, fly, agaric, among, siberian, shamans, the, notion, has, become, widespread, since, the, 19th, century, but, no, contemporary, sources, mention, this, use, or, anything, similar, in, their, description, of, berserkers, muscimol, is, generally, a, mild, relaxant, but, it, can, create, a, range, of, different, reactions, within, a, group, of, people, it, is, possible, that, it, could, make, a, person, angry, or, cause, them, to, be, very, jolly, or, sad, jump, about, dance, sing, or, give, way, to, great, fright, comparative, analysis, of, symptoms, have, however, since, shown, hyoscyamus, niger, to, be, a, better, fit, to, the, state, that, characterises, the, berserker, rage, in, 1968, r, gordon, wasson, proposed, that, a, muscaria, was, the, soma, talked, about, in, the, rigveda, of, india, a, claim, which, received, widespread, publicity, and, popular, support, at, the, time, he, noted, that, descriptions, of, soma, omitted, any, description, of, roots, stems, or, seeds, which, suggested, a, mushroom, and, used, the, adjective, h, ri, dazzling, or, flaming, which, the, author, interprets, as, meaning, red, one, line, described, men, urinating, soma, this, recalled, the, practice, of, recycling, urine, in, siberia, soma, is, mentioned, as, coming, from, the, mountains, which, wasson, interpreted, as, the, mushroom, having, been, brought, in, with, the, aryan, migrants, from, the, north, indian, scholars, santosh, kumar, dash, and, sachinanda, padhy, pointed, out, that, both, eating, of, mushrooms, and, drinking, of, urine, were, proscribed, using, as, a, source, the, manusm, ti, in, 1971, vedic, scholar, john, brough, from, cambridge, university, rejected, wasson, s, theory, and, noted, that, the, language, was, too, vague, to, determine, a, description, of, soma, in, his, 1976, survey, hallucinogens, and, culture, anthropologist, peter, t, furst, evaluated, the, evidence, for, and, against, the, identification, of, the, fly, agaric, mushroom, as, the, vedic, soma, concluding, cautiously, in, its, favour, kevin, feeney, and, trent, austin, compared, the, references, in, the, vedas, with, the, filtering, mechanisms, in, the, preparation, of, amanita, muscaria, and, published, findings, supporting, the, proposal, that, fly, agaric, mushrooms, could, be, a, likely, candidate, for, the, sacrament, other, proposed, candidates, include, psilocybe, cubensis, peganum, harmala, and, ephedra, philologist, archaeologist, and, dead, sea, scrolls, scholar, john, marco, allegro, postulated, that, early, christian, theology, was, derived, from, a, fertility, cult, revolving, around, the, entheogenic, consumption, of, a, muscaria, in, his, 1970, book, the, sacred, mushroom, and, the, cross, this, theory, has, found, little, support, by, scholars, outside, the, field, of, ethnomycology, the, book, was, widely, criticized, by, academics, and, theologians, including, sir, godfrey, driver, emeritus, professor, of, semitic, philology, at, oxford, university, and, henry, chadwick, the, dean, of, christ, church, oxford, christian, author, john, c, king, wrote, a, detailed, rebuttal, of, allegro, s, theory, in, the, 1970, book, a, christian, view, of, the, mushroom, myth, he, notes, that, neither, fly, agarics, nor, their, host, trees, are, found, in, the, middle, east, even, though, cedars, and, pines, are, found, there, and, highlights, the, tenuous, nature, of, the, links, between, biblical, and, sumerian, names, coined, by, allegro, he, concludes, that, if, the, theory, were, true, the, use, of, the, mushroom, must, have, been, the, best, kept, secret, in, the, world, as, it, was, so, well, concealed, for, two, thousand, years, amanita, muscaria, is, traditionally, used, for, catching, flies, possibly, due, to, its, content, of, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, which, lead, to, its, common, name, fly, agaric, recently, an, analysis, of, nine, different, methods, for, preparing, a, muscaria, for, catching, flies, in, slovenia, have, shown, that, the, release, of, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, did, not, depend, on, the, solvent, milk, or, water, and, that, thermal, and, mechanical, processing, led, to, faster, extraction, of, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, the, toxins, in, a, muscaria, are, water, soluble, parboiling, a, muscaria, fruit, bodies, can, detoxify, them, and, render, them, edible, although, consumption, of, the, mushroom, as, a, food, has, never, been, widespread, the, consumption, of, detoxified, a, muscaria, has, been, practiced, in, some, parts, of, europe, notably, by, russian, settlers, in, siberia, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, and, likely, earlier, the, german, physician, and, naturalist, georg, heinrich, von, langsdorff, wrote, the, earliest, published, account, on, how, to, detoxify, this, mushroom, in, 1823, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, french, physician, f, lix, archim, de, pouchet, was, a, populariser, and, advocate, of, a, muscaria, consumption, comparing, it, to, manioc, an, important, food, source, in, tropical, south, america, that, must, also, be, detoxified, before, consumption, use, of, this, mushroom, as, a, food, source, also, seems, to, have, existed, in, north, america, a, classic, description, of, this, use, of, a, muscaria, by, an, african, american, mushroom, seller, in, washington, d, c, in, the, late, 19th, century, is, described, by, american, botanist, frederick, vernon, coville, in, this, case, the, mushroom, after, parboiling, and, soaking, in, vinegar, is, made, into, a, mushroom, sauce, for, steak, it, is, also, consumed, as, a, food, in, parts, of, japan, the, most, well, known, current, use, as, an, edible, mushroom, is, in, nagano, prefecture, japan, there, it, is, primarily, salted, and, pickled, a, 2008, paper, by, food, historian, william, rubel, and, mycologist, david, arora, gives, a, history, of, consumption, of, a, muscaria, as, a, food, and, describes, detoxification, methods, they, advocate, that, amanita, muscaria, be, described, in, field, guides, as, an, edible, mushroom, though, accompanied, by, a, description, on, how, to, detoxify, it, the, authors, state, that, the, widespread, descriptions, in, field, guides, of, this, mushroom, as, poisonous, is, a, reflection, of, cultural, bias, as, several, other, popular, edible, species, notably, morels, are, also, toxic, unless, properly, cooked, the, red, and, white, spotted, toadstool, is, a, common, image, in, many, aspects, of, popular, culture, garden, ornaments, and, children, s, picture, books, depicting, gnomes, and, fairies, such, as, the, smurfs, often, show, fly, agarics, used, as, seats, or, homes, fly, agarics, have, been, featured, in, paintings, since, the, renaissance, albeit, in, a, subtle, manner, for, instance, in, hieronymus, bosch, s, painting, the, garden, of, earthly, delights, the, mushroom, can, be, seen, on, the, left, hand, panel, of, the, work, in, the, victorian, era, they, became, more, visible, becoming, the, main, topic, of, some, fairy, paintings, two, of, the, most, famous, uses, of, the, mushroom, are, in, the, mario, franchise, specifically, two, of, the, super, mushroom, power, up, items, and, the, platforms, in, several, stages, which, are, based, on, a, fly, agaric, and, the, dancing, mushroom, sequence, in, the, 1940, disney, film, fantasia, an, account, of, the, journeys, of, philip, von, strahlenberg, to, siberia, and, his, descriptions, of, the, use, of, the, mukhomor, there, was, published, in, english, in, 1736, the, drinking, of, urine, of, those, who, had, consumed, the, mushroom, was, commented, on, by, anglo, irish, writer, oliver, goldsmith, in, his, widely, read, 1762, novel, citizen, of, the, world, the, mushroom, had, been, identified, as, the, fly, agaric, by, this, time, other, authors, recorded, the, distortions, of, the, size, of, perceived, objects, while, intoxicated, by, the, fungus, including, naturalist, mordecai, cubitt, cooke, in, his, books, the, seven, sisters, of, sleep, and, a, plain, and, easy, account, of, british, fungi, this, observation, is, thought, to, have, formed, the, basis, of, the, effects, of, eating, the, mushroom, in, the, 1865, popular, story, alice,
