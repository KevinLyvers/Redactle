the, eudicots, eudicotidae, or, eudicotyledons, are, a, clade, of, flowering, plants, angiosperms, which, are, mainly, characterized, by, having, two, seed, leaves, cotyledons, upon, germination, the, term, derives, from, dicotyledon, etymologically, eu, true, di, two, cotyledon, seed, leaf, previously, they, were, called, tricolpates, or, non, magnoliid, dicots, by, past, authors, the, current, botanical, terms, were, introduced, in, 1991, by, evolutionary, botanist, james, a, doyle, and, paleobotanist, carol, l, hotton, to, emphasize, the, later, evolutionary, divergence, of, tricolpate, dicots, from, earlier, less, specialized, dicots, scores, of, familiar, plants, are, eudicots, including, many, commonly, cultivated, and, edible, plants, numerous, trees, tropicals, and, ornamentals, among, the, most, well, known, eudicot, genera, are, those, of, the, sunflower, helianthus, dandelion, taraxacum, forget, me, not, myosotis, cabbage, brassica, apple, malus, buttercup, ranunculus, maple, acer, and, macadamia, macadamia, most, leafy, mid, latitude, trees, are, also, classified, as, eudicots, with, notable, exceptions, being, the, magnolias, and, american, tulip, tree, liriodendron, which, belong, to, the, magnoliids, and, ginkgo, biloba, which, is, not, an, angiosperm, the, close, relationships, among, flowering, plants, with, tricolpate, pollen, grains, was, initially, seen, in, morphological, studies, of, shared, derived, characters, these, plants, have, a, distinct, trait, in, their, pollen, grains, of, exhibiting, three, colpi, or, grooves, paralleling, the, polar, axis, later, molecular, evidence, confirmed, the, genetic, basis, for, the, evolutionary, relationships, among, flowering, plants, with, tricolpate, pollen, grains, and, dicotyledonous, traits, the, term, means, true, dicotyledons, as, it, contains, the, majority, of, plants, that, have, been, considered, dicots, and, have, characteristics, of, the, dicots, one, of, the, genetic, traits, which, defines, the, eudicots, is, the, duplication, of, della, protein, encoding, genes, in, their, most, recent, common, ancestor, the, term, eudicots, has, subsequently, been, widely, adopted, in, botany, to, refer, to, one, of, the, two, largest, clades, of, angiosperms, constituting, over, 70, of, the, angiosperm, species, monocots, being, the, other, the, remaining, angiosperms, include, magnoliids, and, what, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, basal, angiosperms, or, paleodicots, but, these, terms, have, not, been, widely, or, consistently, adopted, as, they, do, not, refer, to, a, monophyletic, group, the, earlier, name, for, the, eudicots, is, tricolpates, a, name, which, refers, to, the, grooved, structure, of, the, pollen, members, of, the, group, have, tricolpate, pollen, or, forms, derived, from, it, these, pollens, have, three, or, more, pores, set, in, furrows, called, colpi, in, contrast, most, of, the, other, seed, plants, that, is, the, gymnosperms, the, monocots, and, the, paleodicots, produce, monosulcate, pollen, with, a, single, pore, set, in, a, differently, oriented, groove, called, the, sulcus, the, name, tricolpates, is, preferred, by, some, botanists, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, dicots, a, nonmonophyletic, group, the, name, eudicots, plural, is, used, in, the, apg, systems, from, apg, system, of, 1998, to, apg, iv, system, of, 2016, for, classification, of, angiosperms, it, is, applied, to, a, clade, a, monophyletic, group, which, includes, most, of, the, former, dicots, tricolpate, is, a, synonym, for, the, eudicot, monophyletic, group, the, true, dicotyledons, which, are, distinguished, from, all, other, flowering, plants, by, their, tricolpate, pollen, structure, the, number, of, pollen, grain, furrows, or, pores, helps, classify, the, flowering, plants, with, eudicots, having, three, colpi, tricolpate, and, other, groups, having, one, sulcus, pollen, apertures, are, any, modification, of, the, wall, of, the, pollen, grain, these, modifications, include, thinning, ridges, and, pores, they, serve, as, an, exit, for, the, pollen, contents, and, allow, shrinking, and, swelling, of, the, grain, caused, by, changes, in, moisture, content, the, elongated, apertures, furrows, in, the, pollen, grain, are, called, colpi, singular, colpus, which, along, with, pores, are, a, chief, criterion, for, identifying, the, pollen, classes, the, eudicots, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, the, basal, eudicots, and, the, core, eudicots, basal, eudicot, is, an, informal, name, for, a, paraphyletic, group, the, core, eudicots, are, a, monophyletic, group, a, 2010, study, suggested, the, core, eudicots, can, be, divided, into, two, clades, gunnerales, and, a, clade, called, pentapetalae, comprising, all, the, remaining, core, eudicots, the, pentapetalae, can, be, then, divided, into, three, clades, this, division, of, the, eudicots, is, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, paraphyletic, group, ranunculales, proteales, trochodendrales, buxales, gunnerales, dilleniales, saxifragales, vitales, fabids, 8, orders, malvids, 8, orders, santalales, berberidopsidales, caryophyllales, cornales, ericales, campanulids, 7, orders, lamiids, 8, orders, the, following, is, a, more, detailed, breakdown, according, to, apg, iv, showing, within, each, clade, and, orders
