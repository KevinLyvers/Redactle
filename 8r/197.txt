in, chemistry, particularly, in, biochemistry, a, fatty, acid, is, a, carboxylic, acid, with, an, aliphatic, chain, which, is, either, saturated, or, unsaturated, most, naturally, occurring, fatty, acids, have, an, unbranched, chain, of, an, even, number, of, carbon, atoms, from, 4, to, 28, fatty, acids, are, a, major, component, of, the, lipids, up, to, 70, by, weight, in, some, species, such, as, microalgae, but, in, some, other, organisms, are, not, found, in, their, standalone, form, but, instead, exist, as, three, main, classes, of, esters, triglycerides, phospholipids, and, cholesteryl, esters, in, any, of, these, forms, fatty, acids, are, both, important, dietary, sources, of, fuel, for, animals, and, important, structural, components, for, cells, the, concept, of, fatty, acid, acide, gras, was, introduced, in, 1813, by, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, though, he, initially, used, some, variant, terms, graisse, acide, and, acide, huileux, acid, fat, and, oily, acid, fatty, acids, are, classified, in, many, ways, by, length, by, saturation, vs, unsaturation, by, even, vs, odd, carbon, content, and, by, linear, vs, branched, saturated, fatty, acids, have, no, c, c, double, bonds, they, have, the, formula, ch, 3, ch, 2, n, cooh, for, different, n, an, important, saturated, fatty, acid, is, stearic, acid, n, 16, which, when, neutralized, with, sodium, hydroxide, is, the, most, common, form, of, soap, unsaturated, fatty, acids, have, one, or, more, c, c, double, bonds, the, c, c, double, bonds, can, give, either, cis, or, trans, isomers, in, most, naturally, occurring, unsaturated, fatty, acids, each, double, bond, has, three, n, 3, six, n, 6, or, nine, n, 9, carbon, atoms, after, it, and, all, double, bonds, have, a, cis, configuration, most, fatty, acids, in, the, trans, configuration, trans, fats, are, not, found, in, nature, and, are, the, result, of, human, processing, e, g, hydrogenation, some, trans, fatty, acids, also, occur, naturally, in, the, milk, and, meat, of, ruminants, such, as, cattle, and, sheep, they, are, produced, by, fermentation, in, the, rumen, of, these, animals, they, are, also, found, in, dairy, products, from, milk, of, ruminants, and, may, be, also, found, in, breast, milk, of, women, who, obtained, them, from, their, diet, the, geometric, differences, between, the, various, types, of, unsaturated, fatty, acids, as, well, as, between, saturated, and, unsaturated, fatty, acids, play, an, important, role, in, biological, processes, and, in, the, construction, of, biological, structures, such, as, cell, membranes, most, fatty, acids, are, even, chained, e, g, stearic, c18, and, oleic, c18, meaning, they, are, composed, of, an, even, number, of, carbon, atoms, some, fatty, acids, have, odd, numbers, of, carbon, atoms, they, are, referred, to, as, odd, chained, fatty, acids, ocfa, the, most, common, ocfa, are, the, saturated, c15, and, c17, derivatives, pentadecanoic, acid, and, heptadecanoic, acid, respectively, which, are, found, in, dairy, products, on, a, molecular, level, ocfas, are, biosynthesized, and, metabolized, slightly, differently, from, the, even, chained, relatives, most, common, fatty, acids, are, straight, chain, compounds, with, no, additional, carbon, atoms, bonded, as, side, groups, to, the, main, hydrocarbon, chain, branched, chain, fatty, acids, contain, one, or, more, methyl, groups, bonded, to, the, hydrocarbon, chain, most, naturally, occurring, fatty, acids, have, an, unbranched, chain, of, carbon, atoms, with, a, carboxyl, group, cooh, at, one, end, and, a, methyl, group, ch3, at, the, other, end, the, position, of, each, carbon, atom, in, the, backbone, of, a, fatty, acid, is, usually, indicated, by, counting, from, 1, at, the, cooh, end, carbon, number, x, is, often, abbreviated, c, x, or, sometimes, c, x, with, x, 1, 2, 3, etc, this, is, the, numbering, scheme, recommended, by, the, iupac, another, convention, uses, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, in, sequence, starting, with, the, first, carbon, after, the, carboxyl, group, thus, carbon, alpha, is, c, 2, carbon, beta, is, c, 3, and, so, forth, although, fatty, acids, can, be, of, diverse, lengths, in, this, second, convention, the, last, carbon, in, the, chain, is, always, labelled, as, omega, which, is, the, last, letter, in, the, greek, alphabet, a, third, numbering, convention, counts, the, carbons, from, that, end, using, the, labels, 1, 2, alternatively, the, label, x, is, written, n, x, where, the, n, is, meant, to, represent, the, number, of, carbons, in, the, chain, in, either, numbering, scheme, the, position, of, a, double, bond, in, a, fatty, acid, chain, is, always, specified, by, giving, the, label, of, the, carbon, closest, to, the, carboxyl, end, thus, in, an, 18, carbon, fatty, acid, a, double, bond, between, c, 12, or, 6, and, c, 13, or, 5, is, said, to, be, at, position, c, 12, or, 6, the, iupac, naming, of, the, acid, such, as, octadec, 12, enoic, acid, or, the, more, pronounceable, variant, 12, octadecanoic, acid, is, always, based, on, the, c, numbering, the, notation, x, y, is, traditionally, used, to, specify, a, fatty, acid, with, double, bonds, at, positions, x, y, the, capital, greek, letter, delta, corresponds, to, roman, d, for, d, ouble, bond, thus, for, example, the, 20, carbon, arachidonic, acid, is, 5, 8, 11, 14, meaning, that, it, has, double, bonds, between, carbons, 5, and, 6, 8, and, 9, 11, and, 12, and, 14, and, 15, in, the, context, of, human, diet, and, fat, metabolism, unsaturated, fatty, acids, are, often, classified, by, the, position, of, the, double, bond, closest, between, to, the, carbon, only, even, in, the, case, of, multiple, double, bonds, such, as, the, essential, fatty, acids, thus, linoleic, acid, 18, carbons, 9, 12, linole, n, ic, acid, 18, carbon, 6, 9, 12, and, arachidonic, acid, 20, carbon, 5, 8, 11, 14, are, all, classified, as, 6, fatty, acids, meaning, that, their, formula, ends, with, ch, ch, ch, 2, ch, 2, ch, 2, ch, 2, ch, 3, fatty, acids, with, an, odd, number, of, carbon, atoms, are, called, odd, chain, fatty, acids, whereas, the, rest, are, even, chain, fatty, acids, the, difference, is, relevant, to, gluconeogenesis, the, following, table, describes, the, most, common, systems, of, naming, fatty, acids, when, circulating, in, the, plasma, plasma, fatty, acids, not, in, their, ester, fatty, acids, are, known, as, non, esterified, fatty, acids, nefas, or, free, fatty, acids, ffas, ffas, are, always, bound, to, a, transport, protein, such, as, albumin, ffas, also, form, from, triglyceride, food, oils, and, fats, by, hydrolysis, contributing, to, the, characteristic, rancid, odor, an, analogous, process, happens, in, biodiesel, with, risk, of, part, corrosion, fatty, acids, are, usually, produced, industrially, by, the, hydrolysis, of, triglycerides, with, the, removal, of, glycerol, see, oleochemicals, phospholipids, represent, another, source, some, fatty, acids, are, produced, synthetically, by, hydrocarboxylation, of, alkenes, in, animals, fatty, acids, are, formed, from, carbohydrates, predominantly, in, the, liver, adipose, tissue, and, the, mammary, glands, during, lactation, carbohydrates, are, converted, into, pyruvate, by, glycolysis, as, the, first, important, step, in, the, conversion, of, carbohydrates, into, fatty, acids, pyruvate, is, then, decarboxylated, to, form, acetyl, coa, in, the, mitochondrion, however, this, acetyl, coa, needs, to, be, transported, into, cytosol, where, the, synthesis, of, fatty, acids, occurs, this, cannot, occur, directly, to, obtain, cytosolic, acetyl, coa, citrate, produced, by, the, condensation, of, acetyl, coa, with, oxaloacetate, is, removed, from, the, citric, acid, cycle, and, carried, across, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, into, the, cytosol, there, it, is, cleaved, by, atp, citrate, lyase, into, acetyl, coa, and, oxaloacetate, the, oxaloacetate, is, returned, to, the, mitochondrion, as, malate, the, cytosolic, acetyl, coa, is, carboxylated, by, acetyl, coa, carboxylase, into, malonyl, coa, the, first, committed, step, in, the, synthesis, of, fatty, acids, malonyl, coa, is, then, involved, in, a, repeating, series, of, reactions, that, lengthens, the, growing, fatty, acid, chain, by, two, carbons, at, a, time, almost, all, natural, fatty, acids, therefore, have, even, numbers, of, carbon, atoms, when, synthesis, is, complete, the, free, fatty, acids, are, nearly, always, combined, with, glycerol, three, fatty, acids, to, one, glycerol, molecule, to, form, triglycerides, the, main, storage, form, of, fatty, acids, and, thus, of, energy, in, animals, however, fatty, acids, are, also, important, components, of, the, phospholipids, that, form, the, phospholipid, bilayers, out, of, which, all, the, membranes, of, the, cell, are, constructed, the, cell, wall, and, the, membranes, that, enclose, all, the, organelles, within, the, cells, such, as, the, nucleus, the, mitochondria, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, the, golgi, apparatus, the, uncombined, fatty, acids, or, free, fatty, acids, found, in, the, circulation, of, animals, come, from, the, breakdown, or, lipolysis, of, stored, triglycerides, because, they, are, insoluble, in, water, these, fatty, acids, are, transported, bound, to, plasma, albumin, the, levels, of, free, fatty, acids, in, the, blood, are, limited, by, the, availability, of, albumin, binding, sites, they, can, be, taken, up, from, the, blood, by, all, cells, that, have, mitochondria, with, the, exception, of, the, cells, of, the, central, nervous, system, fatty, acids, can, only, be, broken, down, in, mitochondria, by, means, of, beta, oxidation, followed, by, further, combustion, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, to, co, 2, and, water, cells, in, the, central, nervous, system, although, they, possess, mitochondria, cannot, take, free, fatty, acids, up, from, the, blood, as, the, blood, brain, barrier, is, impervious, to, most, free, fatty, acids, excluding, short, chain, fatty, acids, and, medium, chain, fatty, acids, these, cells, have, to, manufacture, their, own, fatty, acids, from, carbohydrates, as, described, above, in, order, to, produce, and, maintain, the, phospholipids, of, their, cell, membranes, and, those, of, their, organelles, studies, on, the, cell, membranes, of, mammals, and, reptiles, discovered, that, mammalian, cell, membranes, are, composed, of, a, higher, proportion, of, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, dha, omega, 3, fatty, acid, than, reptiles, studies, on, bird, fatty, acid, composition, have, noted, similar, proportions, to, mammals, but, with, 1, 3rd, less, omega, 3, fatty, acids, as, compared, to, omega, 6, for, a, given, body, size, this, fatty, acid, composition, results, in, a, more, fluid, cell, membrane, but, also, one, that, is, permeable, to, various, ions, h, na, resulting, in, cell, membranes, that, are, more, costly, to, maintain, this, maintenance, cost, has, been, argued, to, be, one, of, the, key, causes, for, the, high, metabolic, rates, and, concomitant, warm, bloodedness, of, mammals, and, birds, however, polyunsaturation, of, cell, membranes, may, also, occur, in, response, to, chronic, cold, temperatures, as, well, in, fish, increasingly, cold, environments, lead, to, increasingly, high, cell, membrane, content, of, both, monounsaturated, and, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, to, maintain, greater, membrane, fluidity, and, functionality, at, the, lower, temperatures, the, following, table, gives, the, fatty, acid, vitamin, e, and, cholesterol, composition, of, some, common, dietary, fats, fatty, acids, exhibit, reactions, like, other, carboxylic, acids, i, e, they, undergo, esterification, and, acid, base, reactions, fatty, acids, do, not, show, a, great, variation, in, their, acidities, as, indicated, by, their, respective, p, k, a, nonanoic, acid, for, example, has, a, p, k, a, of, 4, 96, being, only, slightly, weaker, than, acetic, acid, 4, 76, as, the, chain, length, increases, the, solubility, of, the, fatty, acids, in, water, decreases, so, that, the, longer, chain, fatty, acids, have, minimal, effect, on, the, ph, of, an, aqueous, solution, near, neutral, ph, fatty, acids, exist, at, their, conjugate, bases, i, e, oleate, etc, solutions, of, fatty, acids, in, ethanol, can, be, titrated, with, sodium, hydroxide, solution, using, phenolphthalein, as, an, indicator, this, analysis, is, used, to, determine, the, free, fatty, acid, content, of, fats, i, e, the, proportion, of, the, triglycerides, that, have, been, hydrolyzed, neutralization, of, fatty, acids, one, form, of, saponification, soap, making, is, a, widely, practiced, route, to, metallic, soaps, hydrogenation, of, unsaturated, fatty, acids, is, widely, practiced, typical, conditions, involve, 2, 0, 3, 0, mpa, of, h, 2, pressure, 150, c, and, nickel, supported, on, silica, as, a, catalyst, this, treatment, affords, saturated, fatty, acids, the, extent, of, hydrogenation, is, indicated, by, the, iodine, number, hydrogenated, fatty, acids, are, less, prone, toward, rancidification, since, the, saturated, fatty, acids, are, higher, melting, than, the, unsaturated, precursors, the, process, is, called, hardening, related, technology, is, used, to, convert, vegetable, oils, into, margarine, the, hydrogenation, of, triglycerides, vs, fatty, acids, is, advantageous, because, the, carboxylic, acids, degrade, the, nickel, catalysts, affording, nickel, soaps, during, partial, hydrogenation, unsaturated, fatty, acids, can, be, isomerized, from, cis, to, trans, configuration, more, forcing, hydrogenation, i, e, using, higher, pressures, of, h, 2, and, higher, temperatures, converts, fatty, acids, into, fatty, alcohols, fatty, alcohols, are, however, more, easily, produced, from, fatty, acid, esters, in, the, varrentrapp, reaction, certain, unsaturated, fatty, acids, are, cleaved, in, molten, alkali, a, reaction, which, was, at, one, point, of, time, relevant, to, structure, elucidation, unsaturated, fatty, acids, and, their, esters, undergo, auto, oxidation, which, involves, replacement, of, a, c, h, bond, with, c, o, bond, the, process, requires, oxygen, air, and, is, accelerated, by, the, presence, of, traces, of, metals, which, serve, as, catalysts, doubly, unsaturated, fatty, acids, are, particularly, prone, to, this, reaction, vegetable, oils, resist, this, process, to, a, small, degree, because, they, contain, antioxidants, such, as, tocopherol, fats, and, oils, often, are, treated, with, chelating, agents, such, as, citric, acid, to, remove, the, metal, catalysts, unsaturated, fatty, acids, are, susceptible, to, degradation, by, ozone, this, reaction, is, practiced, in, the, production, of, azelaic, acid, ch, 2, 7, co, 2, h, 2, from, oleic, acid, short, and, medium, chain, fatty, acids, are, absorbed, directly, into, the, blood, via, intestine, capillaries, and, travel, through, the, portal, vein, just, as, other, absorbed, nutrients, do, however, long, chain, fatty, acids, are, not, directly, released, into, the, intestinal, capillaries, instead, they, are, absorbed, into, the, fatty, walls, of, the, intestine, villi, and, reassemble, again, into, triglycerides, the, triglycerides, are, coated, with, cholesterol, and, protein, protein, coat, into, a, compound, called, a, chylomicron, from, within, the, cell, the, chylomicron, is, released, into, a, lymphatic, capillary, called, a, lacteal, which, merges, into, larger, lymphatic, vessels, it, is, transported, via, the, lymphatic, system, and, the, thoracic, duct, up, to, a, location, near, the, heart, where, the, arteries, and, veins, are, larger, the, thoracic, duct, empties, the, chylomicrons, into, the, bloodstream, via, the, left, subclavian, vein, at, this, point, the, chylomicrons, can, transport, the, triglycerides, to, tissues, where, they, are, stored, or, metabolized, for, energy, fatty, acids, are, broken, down, to, co, 2, and, water, by, the, intra, cellular, mitochondria, through, beta, oxidation, and, the, citric, acid, cycle, in, the, final, step, oxidative, phosphorylation, reactions, with, oxygen, release, a, lot, of, energy, captured, in, the, form, of, large, quantities, of, atp, many, cell, types, can, use, either, glucose, or, fatty, acids, for, this, purpose, but, fatty, acids, release, more, energy, per, gram, fatty, acids, provided, either, by, ingestion, or, by, drawing, on, triglycerides, stored, in, fatty, tissues, are, distributed, to, cells, to, serve, as, a, fuel, for, muscular, contraction, and, general, metabolism, fatty, acids, that, are, required, for, good, health, but, cannot, be, made, in, sufficient, quantity, from, other, substrates, and, therefore, must, be, obtained, from, food, are, called, essential, fatty, acids, there, are, two, series, of, essential, fatty, acids, one, has, a, double, bond, three, carbon, atoms, away, from, the, methyl, end, the, other, has, a, double, bond, six, carbon, atoms, away, from, the, methyl, end, humans, lack, the, ability, to, introduce, double, bonds, in, fatty, acids, beyond, carbons, 9, and, 10, as, counted, from, the, carboxylic, acid, side, two, essential, fatty, acids, are, linoleic, acid, la, and, alpha, linolenic, acid, ala, these, fatty, acids, are, widely, distributed, in, plant, oils, the, human, body, has, a, limited, ability, to, convert, ala, into, the, longer, chain, omega, 3, fatty, acids, eicosapentaenoic, acid, epa, and, docosahexaenoic, acid, dha, which, can, also, be, obtained, from, fish, omega, 3, and, omega, 6, fatty, acids, are, biosynthetic, precursors, to, endocannabinoids, with, antinociceptive, anxiolytic, and, neurogenic, properties, blood, fatty, acids, adopt, distinct, forms, in, different, stages, in, the, blood, circulation, they, are, taken, in, through, the, intestine, in, chylomicrons, but, also, exist, in, very, low, density, lipoproteins, vldl, and, low, density, lipoproteins, ldl, after, processing, in, the, liver, in, addition, when, released, from, adipocytes, fatty, acids, exist, in, the, blood, as, free, fatty, acids, it, is, proposed, that, the, blend, of, fatty, acids, exuded, by, mammalian, skin, together, with, lactic, acid, and, pyruvic, acid, is, distinctive, and, enables, animals, with, a, keen, sense, of, smell, to, differentiate, individuals, the, stratum, corneum, the, outermost, layer, of, the, epidermis, is, composed, of, terminally, differentiated, and, enucleated, corneocytes, within, a, lipid, matrix, together, with, cholesterol, and, ceramides, free, fatty, acids, form, a, water, impermeable, barrier, that, prevents, evaporative, water, loss, generally, the, epidermal, lipid, matrix, is, composed, of, an, equimolar, mixture, of, ceramides, about, 50, by, weight, cholesterol, 25, and, free, fatty, acids, 15, saturated, fatty, acids, 16, and, 18, carbons, in, length, are, the, dominant, types, in, the, epidermis, while, unsaturated, fatty, acids, and, saturated, fatty, acids, of, various, other, lengths, are, also, present, the, relative, abundance, of, the, different, fatty, acids, in, the, epidermis, is, dependent, on, the, body, site, the, skin, is, covering, there, are, also, characteristic, epidermal, fatty, acid, alterations, that, occur, in, psoriasis, atopic, dermatitis, and, other, inflammatory, conditions, the, chemical, analysis, of, fatty, acids, in, lipids, typically, begins, with, an, interesterification, step, that, breaks, down, their, original, esters, triglycerides, waxes, phospholipids, etc, and, converts, them, to, methyl, esters, which, are, then, separated, by, gas, chromatography, or, analyzed, by, gas, chromatography, and, mid, infrared, spectroscopy, separation, of, unsaturated, isomers, is, possible, by, silver, ion, complemented, thin, layer, chromatography, other, separation, techniques, include, high, performance, liquid, chromatography, with, short, columns, packed, with, silica, gel, with, bonded, phenylsulfonic, acid, groups, whose, hydrogen, atoms, have, been, exchanged, for, silver, ions, the, role, of, silver, lies, in, its, ability, to, form, complexes, with, unsaturated, compounds, fatty, acids, are, mainly, used, in, the, production, of, soap, both, for, cosmetic, purposes, and, in, the, case, of, metallic, soaps, as, lubricants, fatty, acids, are, also, converted, via, their, methyl, esters, to, fatty, alcohols, and, fatty, amines, which, are, precursors, to, surfactants, detergents, and, lubricants, other, applications, include, their, use, as, emulsifiers, texturizing, agents, wetting, agents, anti, foam, agents, or, stabilizing, agents, esters, of, fatty, acids, with, simpler, alcohols, such, as, methyl, ethyl, n, propyl, isopropyl, and, butyl, esters, are, used, as, emollients, in, cosmetics, and, other, personal, care, products, and, as, synthetic, lubricants, esters, of, fatty, acids, with, more, complex, alcohols, such, as, sorbitol, ethylene, glycol, diethylene, glycol, and, polyethylene, glycol, are, consumed, in, food, or, used, for, personal, care, and, water, treatment, or, used, as, synthetic, lubricants, or, fluids, for, metal,
