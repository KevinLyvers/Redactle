rats, are, various, medium, sized, long, tailed, rodents, species, of, rats, are, found, throughout, the, order, rodentia, but, stereotypical, rats, are, found, in, the, genus, rattus, other, rat, genera, include, neotoma, pack, rats, bandicota, bandicoot, rats, and, dipodomys, kangaroo, rats, rats, are, typically, distinguished, from, mice, by, their, size, usually, the, common, name, of, a, large, muroid, rodent, will, include, the, word, rat, while, a, smaller, muroid, s, name, will, include, mouse, the, common, terms, rat, and, mouse, are, not, taxonomically, specific, there, are, 56, known, species, of, rats, in, the, world, the, best, known, rat, species, are, the, black, rat, rattus, rattus, and, the, brown, rat, rattus, norvegicus, this, group, generally, known, as, the, old, world, rats, or, true, rats, originated, in, asia, rats, are, bigger, than, most, old, world, mice, which, are, their, relatives, but, seldom, weigh, over, 500, grams, 17, 1, 2, oz, in, the, wild, the, term, rat, is, also, used, in, the, names, of, other, small, mammals, that, are, not, true, rats, examples, include, the, north, american, pack, rats, aka, wood, rats, and, a, number, of, species, loosely, called, kangaroo, rats, rats, such, as, the, bandicoot, rat, bandicota, bengalensis, are, murine, rodents, related, to, true, rats, but, are, not, members, of, the, genus, rattus, male, rats, are, called, bucks, unmated, females, does, pregnant, or, parent, females, dams, and, infants, kittens, or, pups, a, group, of, rats, is, referred, to, as, a, mischief, the, common, species, are, opportunistic, survivors, and, often, live, with, and, near, humans, therefore, they, are, known, as, commensals, they, may, cause, substantial, food, losses, especially, in, developing, countries, however, the, widely, distributed, and, problematic, commensal, species, of, rats, are, a, minority, in, this, diverse, genus, many, species, of, rats, are, island, endemics, some, of, which, have, become, endangered, due, to, habitat, loss, or, competition, with, the, brown, black, or, polynesian, rat, wild, rodents, including, rats, can, carry, many, different, zoonotic, pathogens, such, as, leptospira, toxoplasma, gondii, and, campylobacter, the, black, death, is, traditionally, believed, to, have, been, caused, by, the, microorganism, yersinia, pestis, carried, by, the, tropical, rat, flea, xenopsylla, cheopis, which, preyed, on, black, rats, living, in, european, cities, during, the, epidemic, outbreaks, of, the, middle, ages, these, rats, were, used, as, transport, hosts, another, zoonotic, disease, linked, to, the, rat, is, foot, and, mouth, disease, rats, become, sexually, mature, at, age, 6, weeks, but, reach, social, maturity, at, about, 5, to, 6, months, of, age, the, average, lifespan, of, rats, varies, by, species, but, many, only, live, about, a, year, due, to, predation, the, black, and, brown, rats, diverged, from, other, old, world, rats, in, the, forests, of, asia, during, the, beginning, of, the, pleistocene, the, characteristic, long, tail, of, most, rodents, is, a, feature, that, has, been, extensively, studied, in, various, rat, species, models, which, suggest, three, primary, functions, of, this, structure, thermoregulation, minor, proprioception, and, a, nocifensive, mediated, degloving, response, rodent, tails, particularly, in, rat, models, have, been, implicated, with, a, thermoregulation, function, that, follows, from, its, anatomical, construction, this, particular, tail, morphology, is, evident, across, the, family, muridae, in, contrast, to, the, bushier, tails, of, sciuridae, the, squirrel, family, the, tail, is, hairless, and, thin, skinned, but, highly, vascularized, thus, allowing, for, efficient, countercurrent, heat, exchange, with, the, environment, the, high, muscular, and, connective, tissue, densities, of, the, tail, along, with, ample, muscle, attachment, sites, along, its, plentiful, caudal, vertebrae, facilitate, specific, proprioceptive, senses, to, help, orient, the, rodent, in, a, three, dimensional, environment, murids, have, evolved, a, unique, defense, mechanism, termed, degloving, that, allows, for, escape, from, predation, through, the, loss, of, the, outermost, integumentary, layer, on, the, tail, however, this, mechanism, is, associated, with, multiple, pathologies, that, have, been, the, subject, of, investigation, multiple, studies, have, explored, the, thermoregulatory, capacity, of, rodent, tails, by, subjecting, test, organisms, to, varying, levels, of, physical, activity, and, quantifying, heat, conduction, via, the, animals, tails, one, study, demonstrated, a, significant, disparity, in, heat, dissipation, from, a, rat, s, tail, relative, to, its, abdomen, this, observation, was, attributed, to, the, higher, proportion, of, vascularity, in, the, tail, as, well, as, its, higher, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, which, directly, relates, to, heat, s, ability, to, dissipate, via, the, skin, these, findings, were, confirmed, in, a, separate, study, analyzing, the, relationships, of, heat, storage, and, mechanical, efficiency, in, rodents, that, exercise, in, warm, environments, in, this, study, the, tail, was, a, focal, point, in, measuring, heat, accumulation, and, modulation, on, the, other, hand, the, tail, s, ability, to, function, as, a, proprioceptive, sensor, and, modulator, has, also, been, investigated, as, aforementioned, the, tail, demonstrates, a, high, degree, of, muscularization, and, subsequent, innervation, that, ostensibly, collaborate, in, orienting, the, organism, specifically, this, is, accomplished, by, coordinated, flexion, and, extension, of, tail, muscles, to, produce, slight, shifts, in, the, organism, s, center, of, mass, orientation, etc, which, ultimately, assists, it, with, achieving, a, state, of, proprioceptive, balance, in, its, environment, further, mechanobiological, investigations, of, the, constituent, tendons, in, the, tail, of, the, rat, have, identified, multiple, factors, that, influence, how, the, organism, navigates, its, environment, with, this, structure, a, particular, example, is, that, of, a, study, in, which, the, morphology, of, these, tendons, is, explicated, in, detail, namely, cell, viability, tests, of, tendons, of, the, rat, s, tail, demonstrate, a, higher, proportion, of, living, fibroblasts, that, produce, the, collagen, for, these, fibers, as, in, humans, these, tendons, contain, a, high, density, of, golgi, tendon, organs, that, help, the, animal, assess, stretching, of, muscle, in, situ, and, adjust, accordingly, by, relaying, the, information, to, higher, cortical, areas, associated, with, balance, proprioception, and, movement, the, characteristic, tail, of, murids, also, displays, a, unique, defense, mechanism, known, as, degloving, in, which, the, outer, layer, of, the, integument, can, be, detached, in, order, to, facilitate, the, animal, s, escape, from, a, predator, this, evolutionary, selective, pressure, has, persisted, despite, a, multitude, of, pathologies, that, can, manifest, upon, shedding, part, of, the, tail, and, exposing, more, interior, elements, to, the, environment, paramount, among, these, are, bacterial, and, viral, infection, as, the, high, density, of, vascular, tissue, within, the, tail, becomes, exposed, upon, avulsion, or, similar, injury, to, the, structure, the, degloving, response, is, a, nocifensive, response, meaning, that, it, occurs, when, the, animal, is, subjected, to, acute, pain, such, as, when, a, predator, snatches, the, organism, by, the, tail, specially, bred, rats, have, been, kept, as, pets, at, least, since, the, late, 19th, century, pet, rats, are, typically, variants, of, the, species, brown, rat, but, black, rats, and, giant, pouched, rats, are, also, sometimes, kept, pet, rats, behave, differently, from, their, wild, counterparts, depending, on, how, many, generations, they, have, been, kept, as, pets, pet, rats, do, not, pose, any, more, of, a, risk, of, zoonotic, diseases, than, pets, such, as, cats, or, dogs, tamed, rats, are, generally, friendly, and, can, be, taught, to, perform, selected, behaviors, selective, breeding, has, brought, about, different, color, and, marking, varieties, in, rats, genetic, mutations, have, also, created, different, fur, types, such, as, rex, and, hairless, congenital, malformation, in, selective, breeding, have, created, the, dumbo, rat, a, popular, pet, choice, due, to, their, low, saucer, shaped, ears, a, breeding, standard, exists, for, rat, fanciers, wishing, to, breed, and, show, their, rat, at, a, rat, show, in, 1895, clark, university, in, worcester, massachusetts, established, a, population, of, domestic, albino, brown, rats, to, study, the, effects, of, diet, and, for, other, physiological, studies, over, the, years, rats, have, been, used, in, many, experimental, studies, adding, to, our, understanding, of, genetics, diseases, the, effects, of, drugs, and, other, topics, that, have, provided, a, great, benefit, for, the, health, and, wellbeing, of, humankind, the, aortic, arches, of, the, rat, are, among, the, most, commonly, studied, in, murine, models, due, to, marked, anatomical, homology, to, the, human, cardiovascular, system, both, rat, and, human, aortic, arches, exhibit, subsequent, branching, of, the, brachiocephalic, trunk, left, common, carotid, artery, and, left, subclavian, artery, as, well, as, geometrically, similar, nonplanar, curvature, in, the, aortic, branches, aortic, arches, studied, in, rats, exhibit, abnormalities, similar, to, those, of, humans, including, altered, pulmonary, arteries, and, double, or, absent, aortic, arches, despite, existing, anatomical, analogy, in, the, inthrathoracic, position, of, the, heart, itself, the, murine, model, of, the, heart, and, its, structures, remains, a, valuable, tool, for, studies, of, human, cardiovascular, conditions, the, rat, s, larynx, has, been, used, in, experimentations, that, involve, inhalation, toxicity, allograft, rejection, and, irradiation, responses, one, experiment, described, four, features, of, the, rat, s, larynx, the, first, being, the, location, and, attachments, of, the, thyroarytenoid, muscle, the, alar, cricoarytenoid, muscle, and, the, superior, cricoarytenoid, muscle, the, other, of, the, newly, named, muscle, that, ran, from, the, arytenoid, to, a, midline, tubercle, on, the, cricoid, the, newly, named, muscles, were, not, seen, in, the, human, larynx, in, addition, the, location, and, configuration, of, the, laryngeal, alar, cartilage, was, described, the, second, feature, was, that, the, way, the, newly, named, muscles, appear, to, be, familiar, to, those, in, the, human, larynx, the, third, feature, was, that, a, clear, understanding, of, how, meps, are, distributed, in, each, of, the, laryngeal, muscles, was, helpful, in, understanding, the, effects, of, botulinum, toxin, injection, the, meps, in, the, posterior, cricoarytenoid, muscle, lateral, cricoarytenoid, muscle, cricothyroid, muscle, and, superior, cricoarytenoid, muscle, were, focused, mostly, at, the, midbelly, in, addition, the, medial, thyroarytenoid, muscle, were, focused, at, the, midbelly, while, the, lateral, thyroarytenoid, muscle, meps, were, focused, at, the, anterior, third, of, the, belly, the, fourth, and, final, feature, that, was, cleared, up, was, how, the, meps, were, distributed, in, the, thyroarytenoid, muscle, laboratory, rats, have, also, proved, valuable, in, psychological, studies, of, learning, and, other, mental, processes, barnett, 2002, as, well, as, to, understand, group, behavior, and, overcrowding, with, the, work, of, john, b, calhoun, on, behavioral, sink, a, 2007, study, found, rats, to, possess, metacognition, a, mental, ability, previously, only, documented, in, humans, and, some, primates, domestic, rats, differ, from, wild, rats, in, many, ways, they, are, calmer, and, less, likely, to, bite, they, can, tolerate, greater, crowding, they, breed, earlier, and, produce, more, offspring, and, their, brains, livers, kidneys, adrenal, glands, and, hearts, are, smaller, barnett, 2002, brown, rats, are, often, used, as, model, organisms, for, scientific, research, since, the, publication, of, the, rat, genome, sequence, and, other, advances, such, as, the, creation, of, a, rat, snp, chip, and, the, production, of, knockout, rats, the, laboratory, rat, has, become, a, useful, genetic, tool, although, not, as, popular, as, mice, when, it, comes, to, conducting, tests, related, to, intelligence, learning, and, drug, abuse, rats, are, a, popular, choice, due, to, their, high, intelligence, ingenuity, aggressiveness, and, adaptability, their, psychology, seems, in, many, ways, similar, to, that, of, humans, entirely, new, breeds, or, lines, of, brown, rats, such, as, the, wistar, rat, have, been, bred, for, use, in, laboratories, much, of, the, genome, of, rattus, norvegicus, has, been, sequenced, early, studies, found, evidence, both, for, and, against, measurable, intelligence, using, the, g, factor, in, rats, part, of, the, difficulty, of, understanding, animal, cognition, generally, is, determining, what, to, measure, one, aspect, of, intelligence, is, the, ability, to, learn, which, can, be, measured, using, a, maze, like, the, t, maze, experiments, done, in, the, 1920s, showed, that, some, rats, performed, better, than, others, in, maze, tests, and, if, these, rats, were, selectively, bred, their, offspring, also, performed, better, suggesting, that, in, rats, an, ability, to, learn, was, heritable, in, some, way, rat, meat, is, a, food, that, while, taboo, in, some, cultures, is, a, dietary, staple, in, others, rats, have, been, used, as, working, animals, tasks, for, working, rats, include, the, sniffing, of, gunpowder, residue, demining, acting, and, animal, assisted, therapy, rats, have, a, keen, sense, of, smell, and, are, easy, to, train, these, characteristics, have, been, employed, for, example, by, the, belgian, non, governmental, organization, apopo, which, trains, rats, specifically, african, giant, pouched, rats, to, detect, landmines, and, diagnose, tuberculosis, through, smell, rats, have, long, been, considered, deadly, pests, once, considered, a, modern, myth, the, rat, flood, in, india, occurs, every, fifty, years, as, armies, of, bamboo, rats, descend, upon, rural, areas, and, devour, everything, in, their, path, rats, have, long, been, held, up, as, the, chief, villain, in, the, spread, of, the, bubonic, plague, however, recent, studies, show, that, rats, alone, could, not, account, for, the, rapid, spread, of, the, disease, through, europe, in, the, middle, ages, still, the, centers, for, disease, control, does, list, nearly, a, dozen, diseases, directly, linked, to, rats, most, urban, areas, battle, rat, infestations, a, 2015, study, by, the, american, housing, survey, ahs, found, that, eighteen, percent, of, homes, in, philadelphia, showed, evidence, of, rodents, boston, new, york, city, and, washington, d, c, also, demonstrated, significant, rodent, infestations, indeed, rats, in, new, york, city, are, famous, for, their, size, and, prevalence, the, urban, legend, that, the, rat, population, in, manhattan, equals, that, of, its, human, population, was, definitively, refuted, by, robert, sullivan, in, his, book, rats, but, illustrates, new, yorkers, awareness, of, the, presence, and, on, occasion, boldness, and, cleverness, of, the, rodents, new, york, has, specific, regulations, for, eradicating, rats, multifamily, residences, and, commercial, businesses, must, use, a, specially, trained, and, licensed, rat, catcher, chicago, was, declared, the, rattiest, city, in, the, us, by, the, pest, control, company, orkin, in, 2020, for, the, sixth, consecutive, time, it, s, followed, by, los, angeles, new, york, washington, dc, and, san, francisco, to, help, combat, the, problem, a, chicago, animal, shelter, has, placed, more, than, 1000, feral, cats, sterilized, and, vaccinated, outside, of, homes, and, businesses, since, 2012, where, they, hunt, and, catch, rats, while, also, providing, a, deterrent, simply, by, their, presence, rats, have, the, ability, to, swim, up, sewer, pipes, into, toilets, rats, will, infest, any, area, that, provides, shelter, and, easy, access, to, sources, of, food, and, water, including, under, sinks, near, garbage, and, inside, walls, or, cabinets, rats, can, serve, as, zoonotic, vectors, for, certain, pathogens, and, thus, spread, disease, such, as, bubonic, plague, lassa, fever, leptospirosis, and, hantavirus, infection, researchers, studying, new, york, city, wastewater, have, also, cited, rats, as, the, potential, source, of, cryptic, sars, cov, 2, lineages, due, to, unknown, viral, rna, fragments, in, sewage, matching, mutations, previously, shown, to, make, sars, cov, 2, more, adept, at, rodent, based, transmission, rats, are, also, associated, with, human, dermatitis, because, they, are, frequently, infested, with, blood, feeding, rodent, mites, such, as, the, tropical, rat, mite, ornithonyssus, bacoti, and, spiny, rat, mite, laelaps, echidnina, which, will, opportunistically, bite, and, feed, on, humans, where, the, condition, is, known, as, rat, mite, dermatitis, when, introduced, into, locations, where, rats, previously, did, not, exist, they, can, wreak, an, enormous, degree, of, environmental, degradation, rattus, rattus, the, black, rat, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, world, s, worst, invasive, species, also, known, as, the, ship, rat, it, has, been, carried, worldwide, as, a, stowaway, on, seagoing, vessels, for, millennia, and, has, usually, accompanied, men, to, any, new, area, visited, or, settled, by, human, beings, by, sea, rats, first, got, to, countries, such, as, america, and, australia, by, stowing, away, on, ships, the, similar, species, rattus, norvegicus, the, brown, rat, or, wharf, rat, has, also, been, carried, worldwide, by, ships, in, recent, centuries, the, ship, or, wharf, rat, has, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, many, species, of, wildlife, including, birds, small, mammals, reptiles, invertebrates, and, plants, especially, on, islands, true, rats, are, omnivorous, capable, of, eating, a, wide, range, of, plant, and, animal, foods, and, have, a, very, high, birth, rate, when, introduced, to, a, new, area, they, quickly, reproduce, to, take, advantage, of, the, new, food, supply, in, particular, they, prey, on, the, eggs, and, young, of, forest, birds, which, on, isolated, islands, often, have, no, other, predators, and, thus, have, no, fear, of, predators, some, experts, believe, that, rats, are, to, blame, for, between, forty, percent, and, sixty, percent, of, all, seabird, and, reptile, extinctions, with, ninety, percent, of, those, occurring, on, islands, thus, man, has, indirectly, caused, the, extinction, of, many, species, by, accidentally, introducing, rats, to, new, areas, rats, are, found, in, nearly, all, areas, of, earth, which, are, inhabited, by, human, beings, the, only, rat, free, continent, is, antarctica, which, is, too, cold, for, rat, survival, outdoors, and, its, lack, of, human, habitation, does, not, provide, buildings, to, shelter, them, from, the, weather, however, rats, have, been, introduced, to, many, of, the, islands, near, antarctica, and, because, of, their, destructive, effect, on, native, flora, and, fauna, efforts, to, eradicate, them, are, ongoing, in, particular, bird, island, just, off, rat, infested, south, georgia, island, where, breeding, seabirds, could, be, badly, affected, if, rats, were, introduced, is, subject, to, special, measures, and, regularly, monitored, for, rat, invasions, as, part, of, island, restoration, some, islands, rat, populations, have, been, eradicated, to, protect, or, restore, the, ecology, hawadax, island, alaska, was, declared, rat, free, after, 229, years, and, campbell, island, new, zealand, after, almost, 200, years, breaksea, island, in, new, zealand, was, declared, rat, free, in, 1988, after, an, eradication, campaign, based, on, a, successful, trial, on, the, smaller, hawea, island, nearby, in, january, 2015, an, international, rat, team, set, sail, from, the, falkland, islands, for, the, british, overseas, territory, of, south, georgia, and, the, south, sandwich, islands, on, board, a, ship, carrying, three, helicopters, and, 100, tons, of, rat, poison, with, the, objective, of, reclaiming, the, island, for, its, seabirds, rats, have, wiped, out, more, than, 90, of, the, seabirds, on, south, georgia, and, the, sponsors, hope, that, once, the, rats, are, gone, it, will, regain, its, former, status, as, home, to, the, greatest, concentration, of, seabirds, in, the, world, the, south, georgia, heritage, trust, which, organized, the, mission, describes, it, as, five, times, larger, than, any, other, rodent, eradication, attempted, worldwide, that, would, be, true, if, it, were, not, for, the, rat, control, program, in, alberta, see, below, the, canadian, province, of, alberta, is, notable, for, being, the, largest, inhabited, area, on, earth, which, is, free, of, true, rats, due, to, very, aggressive, government, rat, control, policies, it, has, large, numbers, of, native, pack, rats, also, called, bushy, tailed, wood, rats, but, they, are, forest, dwelling, vegetarians, which, are, much, less, destructive, than, true, rats, alberta, was, settled, by, europeans, relatively, late, in, north, american, history, and, only, became, a, province, in, 1905, black, rats, cannot, survive, in, its, climate, at, all, and, brown, rats, must, live, near, people, and, in, their, structures, to, survive, the, winters, there, are, numerous, predators, in, canada, s, vast, natural, areas, which, will, eat, non, native, rats, so, it, took, until, 1950, for, invading, rats, to, make, their, way, over, land, from, eastern, canada, immediately, upon, their, arrival, at, the, eastern, border, with, saskatchewan, the, alberta, government, implemented, an, extremely, aggressive, rat, control, program, to, stop, them, from, advancing, further, a, systematic, detection, and, eradication, system, was, used, throughout, a, control, zone, about, 600, kilometres, 400, mi, long, and, 30, kilometres, 20, mi, wide, along, the, eastern, border, to, eliminate, rat, infestations, before, the, rats, could, spread, further, into, the, province, shotguns, bulldozers, high, explosives, poison, gas, and, incendiaries, were, used, to, destroy, rats, numerous, farm, buildings, were, destroyed, in, the, process, initially, tons, of, arsenic, trioxide, were, spread, around, thousands, of, farm, yards, to, poison, rats, but, soon, after, the, program, commenced, the, rodenticide, and, medical, drug, warfarin, was, introduced, which, is, much, safer, for, people, and, more, effective, at, killing, rats, than, arsenic, forceful, government, control, measures, strong, public, support, and, enthusiastic, citizen, participation, continue, to, keep, rat, infestations, to, a, minimum, the, effectiveness, has, been, aided, by, a, similar, but, newer, program, in, saskatchewan, which, prevents, rats, from, even, reaching, the, alberta, border, alberta, still, employs, an, armed, rat, patrol, to, control, rats, along, alberta, s, borders, about, ten, single, rats, are, found, and, killed, per, year, and, occasionally, a, large, localized, infestation, has, to, be, dug, out, with, heavy, machinery, but, the, number, of, permanent, rat, infestations, is, zero, ancient, romans, did, not, generally, differentiate, between, rats, and, mice, instead, referring, to, the, former, as, mus, maximus, big, mouse, and, the, latter, as, mus, minimus, little, mouse, on, the, isle, of, man, there, is, a, taboo, against, the, word, rat, the, rat, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, mouse, is, the, first, of, the, twelve, animals, of, the, chinese, zodiac, people, born, in, this, year, are, expected, to, possess, qualities, associated, with, rats, including, creativity, intelligence, honesty, generosity, ambition, a, quick, temper, and, wastefulness, people, born, in, a, year, of, the, rat, are, said, to, get, along, well, with, monkeys, and, dragons, and, to, get, along, poorly, with, horses, in, indian, tradition, rats, are, seen, as, the, vehicle, of, ganesha, and, a, rat, s, statue, is, always, found, in, a, temple, of, ganesh, in, the, northwestern, indian, city, of, deshnoke, the, rats, at, the, karni, mata, temple, are, held, to, be, destined, for, reincarnation, as, sadhus, hindu, holy, men, the, attending, priests, feed, milk, and, grain, to, the, rats, of, which, the, pilgrims, also, partake, european, associations, with, the, rat, are, generally, negative, for, instance, rats, is, used, as, a, substitute, for, various, vulgar, interjections, in, the, english, language, these, associations, do, not, draw, per, se, from, any, biological, or, behavioral, trait, of, the, rat, but, possibly, from, the, association, of, rats, and, fleas, with, the, 14th, century, medieval, plague, called, the, black, death, rats, are, seen, as, vicious, unclean, parasitic, animals, that, steal, food, and, spread, disease, in, 1522, the, rats, in, autun, france, were, charged, and, put, on, trial, for, destroying, crops, however, some, people, in, european, cultures, keep, rats, as, pets, and, conversely, find, them, to, be, tame, clean, intelligent, and, playful, rats, are, often, used, in, scientific, experiments, animal, rights, activists, allege, the, treatment, of, rats, in, this, context, is, cruel, the, term, lab, rat, is, used, typically, in, a, self, effacing, manner, to, describe, a, person, whose, job, function, requires, them, to, spend, a, majority, of, their, work, time, engaged, in, bench, level, research, such, as, postgraduate, students, in, the, sciences, rats, are, frequently, blamed, for, damaging, food, supplies, and, other, goods, or, spreading, disease, their, reputation, has, carried, into, common,
