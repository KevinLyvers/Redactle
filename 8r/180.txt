lactose, or, milk, sugar, is, a, disaccharide, composed, of, galactose, and, glucose, and, has, the, molecular, formula, c, 12, h, 22, o, 11, lactose, makes, up, around, 2, 8, of, milk, by, mass, the, name, comes, from, lact, gen, lactis, the, latin, word, for, milk, plus, the, suffix, ose, used, to, name, sugars, the, compound, is, a, white, water, soluble, non, hygroscopic, solid, with, a, mildly, sweet, taste, it, is, used, in, the, food, industry, lactose, is, a, disaccharide, composed, of, galactose, and, glucose, which, form, a, 1, 4, glycosidic, linkage, its, systematic, name, is, d, galactopyranosyl, 1, 4, d, glucose, the, glucose, can, be, in, either, the, pyranose, form, or, the, pyranose, form, whereas, the, galactose, can, have, only, the, pyranose, form, hence, lactose, and, lactose, refer, to, the, anomeric, form, of, the, glucopyranose, ring, alone, detection, reactions, for, lactose, are, the, w, hlk, and, fearon, s, test, they, can, be, used, to, detect, the, different, lactose, content, of, dairy, products, such, as, whole, milk, lactose, free, milk, yogurt, buttermilk, coffee, creamer, sour, cream, kefir, etc, lactose, is, hydrolysed, to, glucose, and, galactose, isomerised, in, alkaline, solution, to, lactulose, and, catalytically, hydrogenated, to, the, corresponding, polyhydric, alcohol, lactitol, lactulose, is, a, commercial, product, used, for, treatment, of, constipation, lactose, comprises, about, 2, 8, of, milk, by, weight, several, million, tons, are, produced, annually, as, a, by, product, of, the, dairy, industry, whey, or, milk, plasma, is, the, liquid, remaining, after, milk, is, curdled, and, strained, for, example, in, the, production, of, cheese, whey, is, made, up, of, 6, 5, solids, of, which, 4, 8, is, lactose, which, is, purified, by, crystallisation, industrially, lactose, is, produced, from, whey, permeate, whey, filtrated, for, all, major, proteins, the, protein, fraction, is, used, in, infant, nutrition, and, sports, nutrition, while, the, permeate, can, be, evaporated, to, 60, 65, solids, and, crystallized, while, cooling, lactose, can, also, be, isolated, by, dilution, of, whey, with, ethanol, dairy, products, such, as, yogurt, and, cheese, contain, very, little, lactose, this, is, because, the, bacteria, used, to, make, these, products, breaks, down, lactose, through, the, use, of, galactosidases, infant, mammals, nurse, on, their, mothers, to, drink, milk, which, is, rich, in, lactose, the, intestinal, villi, secrete, the, enzyme, lactase, d, galactosidase, to, digest, it, this, enzyme, cleaves, the, lactose, molecule, into, its, two, subunits, the, simple, sugars, glucose, and, galactose, which, can, be, absorbed, since, lactose, occurs, mostly, in, milk, in, most, mammals, the, production, of, lactase, gradually, decreases, with, maturity, due, to, weaning, the, removal, of, lactose, from, the, diet, removes, the, metabolic, pressure, to, continue, to, produce, lactase, for, its, digestion, many, people, with, ancestry, in, europe, west, asia, south, asia, the, sahel, belt, in, west, africa, east, africa, and, a, few, other, parts, of, central, africa, maintain, lactase, production, into, adulthood, due, to, dietary, consumption, of, milk, products, throughout, adulthood, driving, selection, for, genes, that, continue, lactase, production, in, many, of, these, areas, milk, from, mammals, such, as, cattle, goats, and, sheep, is, used, as, a, large, source, of, food, hence, it, was, in, these, regions, that, genes, for, lifelong, lactase, production, first, evolved, the, genes, of, adult, lactose, tolerance, have, evolved, independently, in, various, ethnic, groups, by, descent, more, than, 70, of, western, europeans, can, digest, lactose, as, adults, compared, with, less, than, 30, of, people, from, areas, of, africa, eastern, and, south, eastern, asia, and, oceania, in, people, who, are, lactose, intolerant, lactose, is, not, broken, down, and, provides, food, for, gas, producing, gut, flora, which, can, lead, to, diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and, other, gastrointestinal, symptoms, the, sweetness, of, lactose, is, 0, 2, to, 0, 4, relative, to, 1, 0, for, sucrose, for, comparison, the, sweetness, of, glucose, is, 0, 6, to, 0, 7, of, fructose, is, 1, 3, of, galactose, is, 0, 5, to, 0, 7, of, maltose, is, 0, 4, to, 0, 5, of, sorbose, is, 0, 4, and, of, xylose, is, 0, 6, to, 0, 7, when, lactose, is, completely, digested, in, the, small, intestine, its, caloric, value, is, 4, kcal, g, or, the, same, as, that, of, other, carbohydrates, however, lactose, is, not, always, fully, digested, in, the, small, intestine, depending, on, ingested, dose, combination, with, meals, either, solid, or, liquid, and, lactase, activity, in, the, intestines, the, caloric, value, of, lactose, ranges, from, 2, to, 4, kcal, g, undigested, lactose, acts, as, dietary, fiber, it, also, has, positive, effects, on, absorption, of, minerals, such, as, calcium, and, magnesium, the, glycemic, index, of, lactose, is, 46, to, 65, for, comparison, the, glycemic, index, of, glucose, is, 100, to, 138, of, sucrose, is, 68, to, 92, of, maltose, is, 105, and, of, fructose, is, 19, to, 27, lactose, has, relatively, low, cariogenicity, among, sugars, this, is, because, it, is, not, a, substrate, for, dental, plaque, formation, and, it, is, not, rapidly, fermented, by, oral, bacteria, the, buffering, capacity, of, milk, also, reduces, the, cariogenicity, of, lactose, its, mild, flavor, and, easy, handling, properties, have, led, to, its, use, as, a, carrier, and, stabiliser, of, aromas, and, pharmaceutical, products, lactose, is, not, added, directly, to, many, foods, because, its, solubility, is, less, than, that, of, other, sugars, commonly, used, in, food, infant, formula, is, a, notable, exception, where, the, addition, of, lactose, is, necessary, to, match, the, composition, of, human, milk, lactose, is, not, fermented, by, most, yeast, during, brewing, which, may, be, used, to, advantage, for, example, lactose, may, be, used, to, sweeten, stout, beer, the, resulting, beer, is, usually, called, a, milk, stout, or, a, cream, stout, yeast, belonging, to, the, genus, kluyveromyces, have, a, unique, industrial, application, as, they, are, capable, of, fermenting, lactose, for, ethanol, production, surplus, lactose, from, the, whey, by, product, of, dairy, operations, is, a, potential, source, of, alternative, energy, another, significant, lactose, use, is, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, lactose, is, added, to, tablet, and, capsule, drug, products, as, an, ingredient, because, of, its, physical, and, functional, properties, for, similar, reasons, it, can, be, used, to, dilute, illicit, drugs, such, as, cocaine, or, heroin, the, first, crude, isolation, of, lactose, by, italian, physician, fabrizio, bartoletti, 1576, 1630, was, published, in, 1633, in, 1700, the, venetian, pharmacist, lodovico, testi, 1640, 1707, published, a, booklet, of, testimonials, to, the, power, of, milk, sugar, saccharum, lactis, to, relieve, among, other, ailments, the, symptoms, of, arthritis, in, 1715, testi, s, procedure, for, making, milk, sugar, was, published, by, antonio, vallisneri, lactose, was, identified, as, a, sugar, in, 1780, by, carl, wilhelm, scheele, in, 1812, heinrich, vogel, 1778, 1867, recognized, that, glucose, was, a, product, of, hydrolyzing, lactose, in, 1856, louis, pasteur, crystallized, the, other, component, of, lactose, galactose, by, 1894, emil, fischer, had, established, the, configurations, of, the, component, sugars, lactose, was, named, by, the, french, chemist, jean, baptiste, andr, dumas, 1800, 1884, in, 1843, in, 1856, pasteur, named, galactose, lactose, in, 1860, marcellin, berthelot, renamed, it, galactose, and, transferred, the, name, lactose, to, what, is, now, called, lactose, it, has, a, formula, of, c, 12, h, 22, o, 11, and, the, hydrate, formula, c, 12, h, 22, o, 11, h, 2, o, making, it, an, isomer, of, sucrose
