dysentery, uk, d, s, n, t, r, i, diss, n, t, r, ee, us, d, s, n, t, r, i, diss, n, terr, ee, historically, known, as, the, bloody, flux, is, a, type, of, gastroenteritis, that, results, in, bloody, diarrhea, other, symptoms, may, include, fever, abdominal, pain, and, a, feeling, of, incomplete, defecation, complications, may, include, dehydration, the, cause, of, dysentery, is, usually, the, bacteria, from, genus, shigella, in, which, case, it, is, known, as, shigellosis, or, the, amoeba, entamoeba, histolytica, then, it, is, called, amoebiasis, other, causes, may, include, certain, chemicals, other, bacteria, other, protozoa, or, parasitic, worms, it, may, spread, between, people, risk, factors, include, contamination, of, food, and, water, with, feces, due, to, poor, sanitation, the, underlying, mechanism, involves, inflammation, of, the, intestine, especially, of, the, colon, efforts, to, prevent, dysentery, include, hand, washing, and, food, safety, measures, while, traveling, in, countries, of, high, risk, while, the, condition, generally, resolves, on, its, own, within, a, week, drinking, sufficient, fluids, such, as, oral, rehydration, solution, is, important, antibiotics, such, as, azithromycin, may, be, used, to, treat, cases, associated, with, travelling, in, the, developing, world, while, medications, used, to, decrease, diarrhea, such, as, loperamide, are, not, recommended, on, their, own, they, may, be, used, together, with, antibiotics, shigella, results, in, about, 165, million, cases, of, diarrhea, and, 1, 1, million, deaths, a, year, with, nearly, all, cases, in, the, developing, world, in, areas, with, poor, sanitation, nearly, half, of, cases, of, diarrhea, are, due, to, entamoeba, histolytica, entamoeba, histolytica, affects, millions, of, people, and, results, in, more, than, 55, 000, deaths, a, year, it, commonly, occurs, in, less, developed, areas, of, central, and, south, america, africa, and, asia, dysentery, has, been, described, at, least, since, the, time, of, hippocrates, the, most, common, form, of, dysentery, is, bacillary, dysentery, which, is, typically, a, mild, sickness, causing, symptoms, normally, consisting, of, mild, abdominal, pains, and, frequent, passage, of, loose, stools, or, diarrhea, symptoms, normally, present, themselves, after, 1, 3, days, and, are, usually, no, longer, present, after, a, week, the, frequency, of, urges, to, defecate, the, large, volume, of, liquid, feces, ejected, and, the, presence, of, blood, mucus, or, pus, depends, on, the, pathogen, causing, the, disease, temporary, lactose, intolerance, can, occur, as, well, in, some, occasions, severe, abdominal, cramps, fever, shock, and, delirium, can, all, be, symptoms, in, extreme, cases, people, may, pass, more, than, one, liter, of, fluid, per, hour, more, often, individuals, will, complain, of, diarrhea, with, blood, accompanied, by, extreme, abdominal, pain, rectal, pain, and, a, low, grade, fever, rapid, weight, loss, and, muscle, aches, sometimes, also, accompany, dysentery, while, nausea, and, vomiting, are, rare, in, many, cases, there, can, be, cascading, cramps, that, affect, the, muscles, surrounding, the, entire, upper, intestine, sometimes, severe, enough, to, cause, the, lining, of, the, intestine, to, separate, from, the, wall, leading, to, systemic, infection, on, rare, occasions, the, amoebic, parasite, will, invade, the, body, through, the, bloodstream, and, spread, beyond, the, intestines, in, such, cases, it, may, more, seriously, infect, other, organs, such, as, the, brain, lungs, and, most, commonly, the, liver, dysentery, results, from, bacterial, or, parasitic, infections, viruses, do, not, generally, cause, the, disease, these, pathogens, typically, reach, the, large, intestine, after, entering, orally, through, ingestion, of, contaminated, food, or, water, oral, contact, with, contaminated, objects, or, hands, and, so, on, each, specific, pathogen, has, its, own, mechanism, or, pathogenesis, but, in, general, the, result, is, damage, to, the, intestinal, linings, leading, to, the, inflammatory, immune, responses, this, can, cause, elevated, physical, temperature, painful, spasms, of, the, intestinal, muscles, cramping, swelling, due, to, fluid, leaking, from, capillaries, of, the, intestine, edema, and, further, tissue, damage, by, the, body, s, immune, cells, and, the, chemicals, called, cytokines, which, are, released, to, fight, the, infection, the, result, can, be, impaired, nutrient, absorption, excessive, water, and, mineral, loss, through, the, stools, due, to, breakdown, of, the, control, mechanisms, in, the, intestinal, tissue, that, normally, remove, water, from, the, stools, and, in, severe, cases, the, entry, of, pathogenic, organisms, into, the, bloodstream, anemia, may, also, arise, due, to, the, blood, loss, through, diarrhea, bacterial, infections, that, cause, bloody, diarrhea, are, typically, classified, as, being, either, invasive, or, toxogenic, invasive, species, cause, damage, directly, by, invading, into, the, mucosa, the, toxogenic, species, do, not, invade, but, cause, cellular, damage, by, secreting, toxins, resulting, in, bloody, diarrhea, this, is, also, in, contrast, to, toxins, that, cause, watery, diarrhea, which, usually, do, not, cause, cellular, damage, but, rather, they, take, over, cellular, machinery, for, a, portion, of, life, of, the, cell, some, microorganisms, for, example, bacteria, of, the, genus, shigella, secrete, substances, known, as, cytotoxins, which, kill, and, damage, intestinal, tissue, on, contact, shigella, is, thought, to, cause, bleeding, due, to, invasion, rather, than, toxin, because, even, non, toxogenic, strains, can, cause, dysentery, but, e, coli, with, shiga, like, toxins, do, not, invade, the, intestinal, mucosa, and, are, therefore, toxin, dependent, definitions, of, dysentery, can, vary, by, region, and, by, medical, specialty, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, limits, its, definition, to, diarrhea, with, visible, blood, others, define, the, term, more, broadly, these, differences, in, definition, must, be, taken, into, account, when, defining, mechanisms, for, example, using, the, cdc, definition, requires, that, intestinal, tissue, be, so, severely, damaged, that, blood, vessels, have, ruptured, allowing, visible, quantities, of, blood, to, be, lost, with, defecation, other, definitions, require, less, specific, damage, amoebiasis, also, known, as, amoebic, dysentery, is, caused, by, an, infection, from, the, amoeba, entamoeba, histolytica, which, is, found, mainly, in, tropical, areas, proper, treatment, of, the, underlying, infection, of, amoebic, dysentery, is, important, insufficiently, treated, amoebiasis, can, lie, dormant, for, years, and, subsequently, lead, to, severe, potentially, fatal, complications, when, amoebae, inside, the, bowel, of, an, infected, person, are, ready, to, leave, the, body, they, group, together, and, form, a, shell, that, surrounds, and, protects, them, this, group, of, amoebae, is, known, as, a, cyst, which, is, then, passed, out, of, the, person, s, body, in, the, feces, and, can, survive, outside, the, body, if, hygiene, standards, are, poor, for, example, if, the, person, does, not, dispose, of, the, feces, hygienically, then, it, can, contaminate, the, surroundings, such, as, nearby, food, and, water, if, another, person, then, eats, or, drinks, food, or, water, that, has, been, contaminated, with, feces, containing, the, cyst, that, person, will, also, become, infected, with, the, amoebae, amoebic, dysentery, is, particularly, common, in, parts, of, the, world, where, human, feces, are, used, as, fertilizer, after, entering, the, person, s, body, through, the, mouth, the, cyst, travels, down, into, the, stomach, the, amoebae, inside, the, cyst, are, protected, from, the, stomach, s, digestive, acid, from, the, stomach, the, cyst, travels, to, the, intestines, where, it, breaks, open, and, releases, the, amoebae, causing, the, infection, the, amoebae, can, burrow, into, the, walls, of, the, intestines, and, cause, small, abscesses, and, ulcers, to, form, the, cycle, then, begins, again, dysentery, may, also, be, caused, by, shigellosis, an, infection, by, bacteria, of, the, genus, shigella, and, is, then, known, as, bacillary, dysentery, or, marlow, syndrome, the, term, bacillary, dysentery, etymologically, might, seem, to, refer, to, any, dysentery, caused, by, any, bacilliform, bacteria, but, its, meaning, is, restricted, by, convention, to, shigella, dysentery, some, strains, of, escherichia, coli, cause, bloody, diarrhea, the, typical, culprits, are, enterohemorrhagic, escherichia, coli, of, which, o157, h7, is, the, best, known, these, types, of, e, coli, also, make, shiga, toxin, a, diagnosis, may, be, made, by, taking, a, history, and, doing, a, brief, examination, dysentery, should, not, be, confused, with, hematochezia, which, is, the, passage, of, fresh, blood, through, the, anus, usually, in, or, with, stools, the, mouth, skin, and, lips, may, appear, dry, due, to, dehydration, lower, abdominal, tenderness, may, also, be, present, cultures, of, stool, samples, are, examined, to, identify, the, organism, causing, dysentery, usually, several, samples, must, be, obtained, due, to, the, number, of, amoebae, which, changes, daily, blood, tests, can, be, used, to, measure, abnormalities, in, the, levels, of, essential, minerals, and, salts, efforts, to, prevent, dysentery, include, hand, washing, and, food, safety, measures, while, traveling, in, areas, of, high, risk, although, there, is, currently, no, vaccine, that, protects, against, shigella, infection, several, are, in, development, vaccination, may, eventually, become, a, part, of, the, strategy, to, reduce, the, incidence, and, severity, of, diarrhea, particularly, among, children, in, low, resource, settings, for, example, shigella, is, a, longstanding, world, health, organization, who, target, for, vaccine, development, and, sharp, declines, in, age, specific, diarrhea, dysentery, attack, rates, for, this, pathogen, indicate, that, natural, immunity, does, develop, following, exposure, thus, vaccination, to, prevent, this, disease, should, be, feasible, the, development, of, vaccines, against, these, types, of, infection, has, been, hampered, by, technical, constraints, insufficient, support, for, coordination, and, a, lack, of, market, forces, for, research, and, development, most, vaccine, development, efforts, are, taking, place, in, the, public, sector, or, as, research, programs, within, biotechnology, companies, dysentery, is, managed, by, maintaining, fluids, using, oral, rehydration, therapy, if, this, treatment, cannot, be, adequately, maintained, due, to, vomiting, or, the, profuseness, of, diarrhea, hospital, admission, may, be, required, for, intravenous, fluid, replacement, in, ideal, situations, no, antimicrobial, therapy, should, be, administered, until, microbiological, microscopy, and, culture, studies, have, established, the, specific, infection, involved, when, laboratory, services, are, not, available, it, may, be, necessary, to, administer, a, combination, of, drugs, including, an, amoebicidal, drug, to, kill, the, parasite, and, an, antibiotic, to, treat, any, associated, bacterial, infection, laudanum, deodorized, tincture, of, opium, may, be, used, for, severe, pain, and, to, combat, severe, diarrhea, if, shigellosis, is, suspected, and, it, is, not, too, severe, letting, it, run, its, course, may, be, reasonable, usually, less, than, a, week, if, the, case, is, severe, antibiotics, such, as, ciprofloxacin, or, tmp, smx, may, be, useful, however, many, strains, of, shigella, are, becoming, resistant, to, common, antibiotics, and, effective, medications, are, often, in, short, supply, in, developing, countries, if, necessary, a, doctor, may, have, to, reserve, antibiotics, for, those, at, highest, risk, for, death, including, young, children, people, over, 50, and, anyone, suffering, from, dehydration, or, malnutrition, amoebic, dysentery, is, often, treated, with, two, antimicrobial, drugs, such, as, metronidazole, and, paromomycin, or, iodoquinol, with, correct, treatment, most, cases, of, amoebic, and, bacterial, dysentery, subside, within, 10, days, and, most, individuals, achieve, a, full, recovery, within, two, to, four, weeks, after, beginning, proper, treatment, if, the, disease, is, left, untreated, the, prognosis, varies, with, the, immune, status, of, the, individual, patient, and, the, severity, of, disease, extreme, dehydration, can, delay, recovery, and, significantly, raises, the, risk, for, serious, complications, including, death, insufficient, data, exists, but, shigella, is, estimated, to, have, caused, the, death, of, 34, 000, children, under, the, age, of, five, in, 2013, and, 40, 000, deaths, in, people, over, five, years, of, age, amoebiasis, infects, over, 50, million, people, each, year, of, whom, 50, 000, die, one, per, thousand, shigella, evolved, with, the, human, expansion, out, of, africa, 50, 000, to, 200, 000, years, ago, the, seed, leaves, and, bark, of, the, kapok, tree, have, been, used, in, traditional, medicines, by, indigenous, peoples, of, the, rainforest, regions, in, the, americas, west, central, africa, and, southeast, asia, in, the, treatment, of, this, disease, in, 1915, australian, bacteriologist, fannie, eleanor, williams, was, serving, as, a, medic, in, greece, with, the, australian, imperial, force, receiving, casualties, directly, from, gallipoli, in, gallipoli, dysentery, was, severely, affecting, soldiers, and, causing, significant, loss, of, manpower, williams, carried, out, serological, investigations, into, dysentery, co, authoring, several, groundbreaking, papers, with, sir, charles, martin, director, of, the, lister, institute, the, result, of, their, work, into, dysentery, was, increased, demand, for, specific, diagnostics, and, curative, sera, bacillus, subtilis, was, marketed, throughout, america, and, europe, from, 1946, as, an, immunostimulatory, aid, in, the, treatment, of, gut, and, urinary, tract, diseases, such, as, rotavirus, and, shigella, but, declined, in, popularity, after, the, introduction, of, consumer, antibiotics
