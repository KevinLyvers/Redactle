pteropus, suborder, yinpterochiroptera, is, a, genus, of, megabats, which, are, among, the, largest, bats, in, the, world, they, are, commonly, known, as, fruit, bats, or, flying, foxes, among, other, colloquial, names, they, live, in, south, asia, southeast, asia, australia, east, africa, and, some, oceanic, islands, in, the, indian, and, pacific, oceans, there, are, at, least, 60, extant, species, in, the, genus, flying, foxes, eat, fruit, and, other, plant, matter, and, occasionally, consume, insects, as, well, they, locate, resources, with, their, keen, sense, of, smell, most, but, not, all, are, nocturnal, they, navigate, with, keen, eyesight, as, they, cannot, echolocate, they, have, long, life, spans, and, low, reproductive, outputs, with, females, of, most, species, producing, only, one, offspring, per, year, their, slow, life, history, makes, their, populations, vulnerable, to, threats, such, as, overhunting, culling, and, natural, disasters, six, flying, fox, species, have, been, made, extinct, in, modern, times, by, overhunting, flying, foxes, are, often, persecuted, for, their, real, or, perceived, role, in, damaging, crops, they, are, ecologically, beneficial, by, assisting, in, the, regeneration, of, forests, via, seed, dispersal, they, benefit, ecosystems, and, human, interests, by, pollinating, plants, like, other, bats, flying, foxes, are, relevant, to, humans, as, a, source, of, disease, as, they, are, the, reservoirs, of, rare, but, fatal, disease, agents, including, australian, bat, lyssavirus, which, causes, rabies, and, hendra, virus, seven, known, human, deaths, have, resulted, from, these, two, diseases, nipah, virus, is, also, transmitted, by, flying, foxes, it, affects, more, people, with, over, 100, attributed, fatalities, they, have, cultural, significance, to, indigenous, people, with, appearances, in, traditional, art, folklore, and, weaponry, their, fur, and, teeth, were, used, as, currency, in, the, past, some, cultures, still, use, their, teeth, as, currency, today, the, genus, name, pteropus, was, coined, by, french, zoologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1762, prior, to, 1998, genus, authority, was, sometimes, given, to, german, naturalist, johann, christian, polycarp, erxleben, although, the, brisson, publication, 1762, predated, the, erxleben, publication, 1777, thus, giving, him, preference, under, the, principle, of, priority, some, authors, gave, preference, to, erxleben, as, genus, authority, because, brisson, s, publication, did, not, consistently, use, binomial, nomenclature, in, 1998, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, iczn, decided, that, brisson, s, 1762, publication, was, a, rejected, work, for, nomenclatural, purposes, despite, rejecting, the, majority, of, the, publication, the, iczn, decided, to, conserve, a, dozen, generic, names, from, the, work, and, retain, brisson, as, authority, including, pteropus, the, type, species, of, the, genus, is, the, mauritian, flying, fox, pteropus, niger, described, as, vespertilio, vampyrus, niger, by, robert, kerr, in, 1792, the, decision, to, designate, p, niger, as, the, type, species, was, made, by, the, iczn, through, their, plenary, powers, over, biological, nomenclature, pteropus, comes, from, ancient, greek, pter, n, meaning, wing, and, po, s, meaning, foot, the, phrase, flying, fox, has, been, used, to, refer, to, pteropus, bats, since, at, least, 1759, acerodon, jubatus, acerodon, celebensis, p, personatus, neopteryx, frosti, p, macrotis, p, mahaganus, p,

tonganus, p, ualanus, p, admiralitatum, p, pohlei, p, mariannus, p, pelewensis, p, yapensis, p, pelewensis, flying, fox, species, vary, in, body, weight, ranging, from, 120, 1, 600, g, 0, 26, 3, 53, lb, across, all, species, males, are, usually, larger, than, females, the, large, flying, fox, has, the, longest, forearm, length, and, reported, wingspan, of, any, bat, species, but, some, bat, species, exceed, it, in, weight, its, wingspan, is, up, to, 1, 5, m, 4, ft, 11, in, and, it, can, weigh, up, to, 1, 1, kg, 2, 1, 2, lb, the, indian, and, great, flying, foxes, are, heavier, at, 1, 6, and, 1, 45, kg, 3, 1, 2, and, 3, 1, 4, lb, respectively, outside, this, genus, the, giant, golden, crowned, flying, fox, genus, acerodon, is, the, only, bat, with, similar, dimensions, most, flying, fox, species, are, considerably, smaller, and, generally, weigh, less, than, 600, g, 21, oz, smaller, species, such, as, the, masked, temminck, s, guam, and, dwarf, flying, foxes, all, weigh, less, than, 170, g, 6, oz, the, pelage, is, long, and, silky, with, a, dense, underfur, in, many, species, individuals, have, a, mantle, of, contrasting, fur, color, on, the, back, of, their, head, the, shoulders, and, the, upper, back, they, lack, tails, as, the, common, name, flying, fox, suggests, their, heads, resemble, that, of, a, small, fox, because, of, their, small, ears, and, large, eyes, females, have, one, pair, of, mammae, located, in, the, chest, region, their, ears, are, long, and, pointed, at, the, tip, and, lack, tragi, the, outer, margin, of, each, ear, forming, an, unbroken, ring, the, toes, have, sharp, curved, claws, while, microbats, only, have, a, claw, on, each, thumb, of, their, forelimbs, flying, foxes, additionally, have, a, claw, on, each, index, finger, the, skulls, of, pteropus, species, are, composed, of, 24, bones, the, snout, is, made, of, 7, the, cranium, of, 16, and, the, mandible, is, a, single, bone, it, has, a, large, and, bulbous, braincase, like, all, mammals, flying, foxes, have, three, middle, ear, ossicles, which, assist, in, transmitting, sound, to, the, brain, flying, fox, skulls, continue, to, develop, after, they, are, born, compared, to, adults, young, flying, foxes, have, very, short, snouts, as, they, reach, maturity, the, maxilla, elongates, gaining, bone, between, the, zygomatic, processes, and, the, canine, teeth, based, on, the, grey, headed, flying, fox, s, development, pups, are, born, with, some, milk, teeth, already, erupted, canines, and, incisors, by, 9, days, old, all, the, milk, teeth, have, emerged, with, a, dental, formula, of, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, and, a, total, of, 20, teeth, by, 140, days, old, 4, 6, months, all, the, milk, teeth, have, fallen, and, been, replaced, by, permanent, teeth, the, canines, are, usually, replaced, first, followed, by, the, premolars, incisors, and, then, molars, the, adult, dental, formula, is, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, for, a, total, of, 34, teeth, the, occlusal, surface, of, the, molars, is, generally, smooth, but, with, longitudinal, furrows, flying, foxes, have, large, hearts, and, a, relatively, fast, heart, rate, resting, individuals, have, a, heart, rate, of, 100, 400, beats, per, minute, flying, foxes, have, simple, digestive, tracts, the, time, between, ingestion, and, excretion, is, as, short, as, 12, minutes, they, lack, both, a, cecum, and, an, appendix, the, stomach, has, marked, cardiac, and, fundic, regions, the, megabats, including, flying, foxes, have, the, greatest, encephalization, quotient, brain, size, relative, to, body, size, of, any, bat, family, at, 1, 20, this, value, is, equivalent, to, that, of, domestic, dogs, flying, foxes, display, behaviors, that, indicate, a, reliance, on, long, term, information, storage, though, they, have, wide, ranging, movements, and, cover, thousands, of, square, kilometers, annually, they, are, consistently, able, to, locate, the, same, resource, patches, and, roosts, they, will, visit, these, resource, patches, consistently, in, a, strategy, known, as, trap, lining, they, can, also, be, conditioned, to, perform, behaviors, such, as, one, study, where, spectacled, flying, foxes, were, trained, to, pull, a, lever, using, juice, as, a, reinforcement, in, a, follow, up, to, the, initial, study, individuals, who, had, learned, to, pull, the, lever, to, receive, juice, still, did, so, 3, 5, years, later, flying, foxes, rely, heavily, on, their, sense, of, smell, they, have, large, olfactory, bulbs, to, process, scents, they, use, scent, to, locate, food, for, mothers, to, locate, their, pups, and, for, mates, to, locate, each, other, males, have, enlarged, androgen, sensitive, sebaceous, glands, on, their, shoulders, that, they, use, for, scent, marking, their, territories, particularly, during, the, mating, season, the, secretions, of, these, glands, vary, by, species, of, the, 65, chemical, compounds, identified, from, the, glands, of, four, species, no, compound, was, found, in, all, species, males, also, engage, in, urine, washing, meaning, that, they, coat, themselves, in, their, own, urine, flying, foxes, do, not, echolocate, and, therefore, rely, on, sight, to, navigate, their, eyes, are, relatively, large, and, positioned, on, the, front, of, their, heads, giving, them, binocular, vision, like, most, mammals, though, not, primates, they, are, dichromatic, they, have, both, rods, and, cones, they, have, blue, cones, that, detect, short, wavelength, light, and, green, cones, that, detect, medium, to, long, wavelengths, the, rods, greatly, outnumber, the, cones, however, as, cones, comprise, only, 0, 5, of, photoreceptors, flying, foxes, are, adapted, to, seeing, in, low, light, conditions, melonycteris, nyctimene, pteralopex, eidolon, acerodon, pteropus, notopteris, aproteles, dobsonia, syconycteris, macroglossus, cynopterus, megaerops, ptenochirus, thoopterus, chironax, aethalops, balionycteris, eonycteris, stenonycteris, rousettus, epomops, epomophorus, micropteropus, megaloglossus, lissonycteris, myonycteris, flying, foxes, are, poorly, represented, in, the, fossil, record, relative, to, the, current, number, of, extant, species, the, pteropodidae, has, one, of, the, most, incomplete, fossil, records, of, any, bat, group, as, of, 2014, no, flying, fox, fossils, are, known, from, before, the, holocene, many, flying, foxes, live, in, the, tropics, where, conditions, for, fossilization, are, poor, based, on, molecular, evolution, flying, foxes, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, with, rousettus, 28, 18, million, years, ago, and, from, their, sister, taxa, neopteryx, and, acerodon, 6, 6, 10, 6, million, years, ago, neopteryx, acerodon, desmalopex, melonycteris, mirimiri, pteralopex, and, styloctenium, are, all, relatively, closely, related, to, the, flying, foxes, as, they, are, the, other, members, of, its, subfamily, pteropodinae, phylogenetic, analysis, indicates, that, flying, foxes, diversified, rapidly, in, an, explosive, evolutionary, radiation, creating, many, taxa, in, a, relatively, short, time, frame, most, flying, fox, lineages, emerged, after, the, zanclean, with, two, major, clades, created, one, consisting, of, the, indian, ocean, species, and, the, other, of, the, melanesian, micronesian, australian, and, insular, southeast, asian, species, flying, foxes, likely, originated, on, mainland, asia, molecular, data, suggests, that, there, were, at, least, three, colonization, events, into, the, indian, ocean, one, event, resulted, in, livingstone, s, fruit, bat, and, the, pemba, flying, fox, which, are, the, westernmost, flying, foxes, a, second, colonization, event, resulted, in, the, rodrigues, flying, fox, to, rodrigues, island, while, a, third, event, resulted, in, several, species, diverging, to, mauritius, the, seychelles, madagascar, and, aldabra, with, one, possible, exception, the, masked, flying, fox, p, personatus, flying, foxes, are, likely, monophyletic, there, are, over, 60, extant, species, of, flying, fox, flying, foxes, are, now, present, from, the, western, indian, ocean, midway, through, the, pacific, ocean, as, far, east, as, the, cook, islands, they, are, found, in, tropical, and, subtropical, climates, many, species, of, flying, fox, are, polygynandrous, meaning, that, each, individual, will, mate, with, several, other, individuals, the, samoa, flying, fox, is, a, notable, exception, because, it, is, monogamous, flying, fox, sexual, behaviors, include, oral, sex, in, addition, to, intercourse, with, fellatio, and, cunnilingus, observed, between, opposite, sexes, as, well, as, homosexual, fellatio, in, at, least, one, species, the, bonin, flying, fox, opposite, sex, oral, sex, is, associated, with, increased, duration, of, intercourse, while, same, sex, fellatio, is, hypothesized, to, encourage, colony, formation, of, otherwise, antagonistic, males, in, colder, climates, flying, fox, gestation, length, varies, among, species, gestation, length, is, 140, 190, days, 4, 6, 6, 3, months, females, have, a, litter, size, of, one, young, at, a, time, called, a, pup, twins, have, been, occasionally, documented, in, some, species, however, twins, can, be, fraternal, identical, or, the, result, of, superfetation, pups, are, altricial, and, sparsely, furred, at, birth, thereby, dependent, on, their, mothers, for, care, pups, are, relatively, small, at, birth, weighing, approximately, 12, of, the, mother, s, weight, bats, in, other, genera, can, have, pups, that, weigh, as, much, as, 30, of, the, mother, s, weight, at, birth, they, cling, to, their, mothers, abdomens, gripping, her, fur, with, their, thumb, claws, and, teeth, females, carry, the, pups, for, the, first, several, weeks, of, life, after, this, the, females, may, leave, the, pups, behind, at, the, roost, at, night, while, they, forage, as, with, nearly, all, bat, species, males, do, not, assist, females, in, parental, care, while, male, flying, foxes, of, at, least, one, species, the, bismarck, masked, flying, fox, can, lactate, it, is, unclear, if, the, lactation, is, functional, and, males, actually, nurse, pups, or, if, it, is, a, result, of, stress, or, malnutrition, pups, fledge, beginning, at, 3, months, old, but, may, not, be, weaned, until, 4, 6, months, old, pups, may, stay, with, their, mothers, until, age, one, flying, foxes, do, not, reach, sexual, maturity, until, 1, 5, 2, years, old, females, can, have, up, to, two, litters, annually, though, one, is, the, norm, due, to, the, long, weaning, period, most, flying, foxes, are, seasonal, breeders, and, give, birth, in, the, spring, though, the, mariana, fruit, bat, seems, to, have, aseasonal, breeding, with, new, pups, documented, throughout, the, year, females, remain, fertile, with, no, decrease, in, reproductive, capability, for, at, least, the, first, 12, or, 13, years, of, life, flying, foxes, like, all, bats, are, long, lived, relative, to, their, size, in, the, wild, average, lifespans, are, likely, 15, years, however, individuals, part, of, populations, that, face, excessive, disturbance, may, have, lifespans, as, short, as, 7, 1, years, in, captivity, individuals, can, live, approximately, 20, 28, years, the, longest, lived, flying, fox, was, an, indian, flying, fox, named, statler, who, was, a, resident, at, bat, world, sanctuary, for, his, last, few, years, he, was, born, at, a, zoo, in, 1987, and, was, 34, years, old, at, the, time, of, his, death, most, flying, fox, species, are, gregarious, and, form, large, aggregations, of, individuals, called, colonies, or, camps, the, large, flying, fox, forms, colonies, of, up, to, 15, 000, individuals, while, the, little, red, flying, fox, forms, colonies, of, up, to, 100, 000, individuals, a, few, species, and, subspecies, such, as, orii, s, flying, fox, p, dasymallus, inopinatus, and, the, ceram, fruit, bat, are, solitary, colony, size, varies, throughout, the, year, in, response, to, biological, needs, the, grey, headed, flying, fox, forms, harems, during, the, breeding, season, consisting, of, one, male, and, up, to, six, females, these, colonies, break, up, after, the, breeding, season, is, over, in, the, bonin, flying, fox, colony, formation, is, based, on, both, the, sex, and, age, of, individuals, as, well, as, the, season, in, the, winter, breeding, season, adult, females, will, form, colonies, that, include, a, few, adult, males, likely, harems, adult, males, who, do, not, roost, with, females, will, form, colonies, with, other, adult, and, subadult, males, subadults, will, form, mixed, sex, subadult, groups, with, each, other, in, the, summer, however, individuals, are, solitary, with, the, exception, of, nursing, females, who, roost, with, their, pups, flying, foxes, consume, 25, 35, of, their, body, weight, daily, they, are, generalists, that, will, consume, a, variety, of, items, to, meet, their, nutritional, needs, food, items, include, fruit, flowers, nectar, and, leaves, they, will, sometimes, deliberately, consume, insects, such, as, cicadas, as, well, in, australia, eucalypt, blossoms, and, pollen, are, preferred, food, sources, followed, by, melaleuca, and, banksia, flowers, they, feed, on, a, wide, variety, of, crops, as, well, causing, conflicts, with, farmers, crops, eaten, by, flying, foxes, include, sisal, cashew, pineapple, areca, breadfruit, jackfruit, neem, papaya, citrus, fig, mango, banana, avocado, guava, sugar, cane, tamarind, grapes, and, more, in, captivity, the, recommended, diet, for, flying, foxes, consists, of, two, thirds, hard, fruits, like, pears, and, apples, and, one, third, soft, fruits, bananas, and, other, high, fiber, fruits, should, only, be, offered, occasionally, as, flying, foxes, are, not, adapted, to, high, fiber, diets, protein, supplements, are, recommended, for, captive, flying, foxes, other, supplements, such, as, vitamin, c, calcium, chondroitin, sulfate, and, glucosamine, can, be, recommended, periodically, the, majority, of, flying, fox, species, are, nocturnal, and, forage, at, night, a, few, island, species, and, subspecies, are, diurnal, however, hypothesized, as, a, response, to, a, lack, of, predators, diurnal, taxa, include, p, melanotus, natalis, the, mauritian, flying, fox, the, caroline, flying, fox, p, p, insularis, and, the, seychelles, fruit, bat, foraging, resources, are, often, far, from, roosts, with, individuals, traveling, up, to, 40, 60, km, 25, 37, mi, to, reach, them, flying, foxes, can, travel, at, 6, m, s, 13, mph, for, three, hours, or, more, and, can, reach, top, speeds, of, 8, 6, m, s, 19, mph, some, colonial, species, will, forage, in, groups, especially, when, resources, are, abundant, less, social, species, will, forage, alone, when, they, land, on, a, tree, with, food, they, will, hang, onto, the, branch, with, their, clawed, hind, feet, and, use, their, clawed, thumbs, to, pull, branches, bearing, flowers, or, fruits, towards, them, as, they, forage, on, fruit, flying, foxes, will, compress, the, fruit, against, the, palate, with, the, tongue, to, squeeze, out, and, consume, the, juices, the, rest, of, the, fruit, is, then, discarded, in, ejecta, pellets, flying, foxes, have, important, roles, as, seed, dispersers, and, pollinators, they, help, spread, the, seeds, in, the, fruit, they, eat, by, discarding, them, in, ejecta, pellets, or, through, their, guano, in, madagascar, fig, seeds, have, better, germination, success, if, they, have, passed, through, the, gut, of, a, flying, fox, which, is, important, because, fig, trees, are, a, vital, pioneer, species, in, regenerating, lost, forest, even, though, flying, foxes, can, have, a, gut, transit, time, as, fast, as, 12, minutes, seeds, can, be, retained, in, the, gut, for, as, long, as, 20, hours, as, the, flying, foxes, travel, large, distances, seeds, can, be, deposited, up, to, 20, km, 12, mi, from, the, parent, tree, they, are, particularly, important, in, fragmented, forests, as, many, other, frugivores, are, terrestrial, and, often, confined, to, forest, fragments, flying, foxes, have, the, capability, to, spread, seeds, beyond, the, forest, fragments, through, flight, flying, foxes, pollinate, a, variety, of, plants, including, the, economically, valuable, durian, they, forage, on, its, nectar, in, such, a, way, that, the, flowers, and, eventual, fruit, production, are, not, usually, harmed, flying, fox, pollination, has, a, positive, effect, on, durian, reproductive, success, suggesting, that, both, flying, foxes, and, durian, trees, benefit, from, this, relationship, of, the, 62, flying, fox, species, evaluated, by, the, iucn, as, of, 2018, 3, are, considered, critically, endangered, the, aru, flying, fox, livingstone, s, fruit, bat, and, the, vanikoro, flying, fox, another, 7, species, are, listed, as, endangered, 20, are, listed, as, vulnerable, 6, as, near, threatened, 14, as, least, concern, and, 8, as, data, deficient, a, further, 4, are, listed, as, extinct, the, dusky, flying, fox, the, large, palau, flying, fox, the, small, mauritian, flying, fox, and, the, guam, flying, fox, over, half, of, the, species, are, threatened, today, with, extinction, and, in, particular, in, the, pacific, a, number, of, species, have, died, out, as, a, result, of, hunting, deforestation, and, predation, by, invasive, species, six, flying, fox, species, are, believed, to, have, gone, extinct, from, 1864, to, 2014, the, guam, large, palau, small, mauritian, dusky, large, samoan, and, the, small, samoan, flying, foxes, all, species, of, pteropus, are, placed, on, appendix, ii, of, cites, and, 10, on, appendix, i, which, restricts, international, trade, individual, species, have, different, legal, protections, from, hunting, and, domestic, trade, that, reflect, the, environmental, laws, of, the, countries, where, they, are, found, in, some, countries, such, as, bangladesh, sri, lanka, and, thailand, flying, foxes, are, absolutely, protected, from, harm, under, the, wildlife, preservation, and, security, act, of, 2012, fauna, and, flora, protection, ordinance, of, 1937, and, wildlife, protection, and, reservation, act, of, 1992, respectively, however, in, thailand, flying, fox, poaching, and, the, illegal, bushmeat, trade, still, occurs, outside, of, protected, areas, the, large, flying, fox, and, the, small, flying, fox, are, particularly, prone, to, poaching, and, roost, disturbance, in, other, countries, such, as, australia, japan, and, the, united, states, some, species, of, conservation, concern, are, protected, under, national, environmental, legislation, while, others, are, not, in, australia, two, flying, foxes, are, listed, under, the, environment, protection, and, biodiversity, conservation, act, of, 1999, the, grey, headed, and, spectacled, flying, foxes, are, listed, as, vulnerable, farmers, can, apply, for, permits, to, kill, flying, foxes, when, they, are, causing, crop, damage, several, flying, fox, species, occur, in, japan, the, bonin, flying, fox, has, been, a, natural, monument, of, japan, since, 1969, which, means, that, it, is, illegal, to, capture, or, disturb, them, without, appropriate, permits, two, subspecies, of, the, ryukyu, flying, fox, p, d, dasymallus, and, p, d, daitoensis, are, also, listed, as, natural, monuments, flying, foxes, are, not, designated, game, species, in, japan, and, therefore, cannot, be, legally, hunted, per, the, wildlife, protection, and, hunting, law, the, bonin, flying, fox, and, p, d, daitoensis, are, also, listed, as, national, endangered, species, meaning, that, they, cannot, be, killed, or, harmed, furthermore, the, sale, or, transfer, of, live, or, dead, individuals, in, whole, or, part, is, also, prohibited, without, permits, despite, not, occurring, in, the, continental, united, states, several, species, and, subspecies, are, listed, under, its, endangered, species, act, of, 1973, pteropus, mariannus, mariannus, a, subspecies, of, the, mariana, fruit, bat, is, listed, as, threatened, while, the, rodrigues, flying, fox, and, guam, flying, fox, are, listed, as, endangered, additionally, the, u, s, government, has, been, petitioned, to, list, the, aru, flying, fox, and, bonin, flying, fox, as, threatened, or, endangered, in, countries, such, as, india, and, pakistan, flying, foxes, explicitly, have, no, legal, protection, in, india, they, are, listed, as, vermin, under, the, wildlife, protection, act, of, 1972, pakistan, s, only, flying, fox, the, indian, flying, fox, is, listed, under, schedule, 4, of, the, punjab, wildlife, protection, preservation, conservation, and, management, act, of, 1974, meaning, that, it, has, no, legal, protections, and, can, be, hunted, in, mauritius, flying, foxes, were, formerly, protected, but, are, now, legally, culled, at, a, large, scale, in, 2015, the, mauritian, government, passed, the, native, terrestrial, biodiversity, and, national, parks, act, which, legalized, culling, of, the, mauritian, flying, fox, in, mauritius, over, 40, 000, mauritian, flying, foxes, were, culled, in, a, two, year, period, reducing, its, population, by, an, estimated, 45, this, decision, was, viewed, with, controversy, with, researchers, stating, because, they, spread, seeds, and, pollinate, flowers, flying, foxes, are, vital, for, regenerating, lost, forests, legal, protection, can, vary, within, a, country, as, well, such, as, in, malaysia, under, the, 1990, protection, of, wild, life, amendment, order, flying, foxes, can, be, hunted, with, a, permit, each, permit, is, good, for, killing, up, to, 50, flying, foxes, permits, cost, u, s, 8, each, however, under, the, protection, of, wildlife, act, of, 1972, flying, foxes, can, be, killed, without, permits, if, they, are, causing, damage, or, if, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, it, is, about, to, cause, serious, damage, to, crops, in, 2012, the, malaysian, state, of, terengganu, issued, a, moratorium, on, hunting, flying, foxes, in, sarawak, all, bat, species, are, listed, as, protected, and, hunting, them, is, not, legal, flying, foxes, species, are, declining, or, going, extinct, as, a, result, of, several, human, impacts, to, their, environments, in, addition, to, natural, phenomena, their, populations, are, especially, vulnerable, to, threats, because, the, litter, size, is, usually, only, individual, and, females, generally, only, have, one, litter, per, year, even, when, nearly, every, female, 90, successfully, produces, and, raises, young, if, a, population, s, mortality, rate, exceeds, 22, annually, then, it, will, steadily, decline, invasive, species, such, as, the, brown, tree, snake, can, seriously, impact, populations, the, brown, tree, snake, consumes, so, many, pups, that, it, reduced, the, recruitment, of, the, guam, population, of, the, mariana, fruit, bat, to, essentially, zero, many, flying, fox, species, are, threatened, by, overhunting, while, they, have, long, been, a, dietary, component, of, indigenous, people, expanding, human, population, and, more, efficient, weapons, have, resulted, in, population, declines, local, extinctions, and, extinctions, overhunting, is, believed, to, be, the, primary, cause, of, extinction, for, the, small, mauritian, flying, fox, and, the, guam, flying, fox, flying, foxes, are, also, threatened, with, excessive, culling, due, to, conflict, with, farmers, they, are, shot, beaten, to, death, or, poisoned, to, reduce, their, populations, mortality, also, occurs, via, accidental, entanglement, into, netting, used, to, prevent, the, bats, from, eating, fruit, culling, can, dramatically, reduce, flying, fox, populations, in, mauritius, over, 40, 000, mauritian, flying, foxes, were, culled, in, a, two, year, period, reducing, its, population, by, an, estimated, 45, flying, foxes, are, also, killed, by, electrocution, in, one, australian, orchard, it, is, estimated, that, over, 21, 000, bats, were, electrocuted, to, death, in, an, 8, week, period, farmers, construct, electrified, grids, over, their, fruit, trees, to, kill, flying, foxes, before, they, can, consume, their, crop, the, grids, are, questionably, effective, at, preventing, crop, loss, with, one, farmer, who, operated, such, a, grid, estimating, that, they, still, lost, 100, 120, tonnes, 110, 130, short, tons, of, fruit, to, flying, foxes, in, a, year, some, electrocution, deaths, are, also, accidental, such, as, when, bats, fly, into, overhead, power, lines, climate, change, causes, flying, fox, mortality, and, a, source, of, concern, for, species, persistence, extreme, heat, waves, in, australia, have, been, responsible, for, the, deaths, of, more, than, 30, 000, australian, flying, foxes, from, 1994, to, 2008, females, and, young, bats, are, most, susceptible, to, extreme, heat, which, affects, a, population, s, ability, to, recover, flying, foxes, are, threatened, by, sea, level, rise, associated, with, climate, change, as, several, taxa, are, endemic, to, low, lying, atolls, because, many, species, are, endemic, to, a, single, island, they, are, vulnerable, to, random, events, such, as, typhoons, a, 1979, typhoon, halved, the, remaining, population, of, the, rodrigues, flying, fox, typhoons, result, in, indirect, mortality, as, well, because, they, defoliate, the, trees, flying, foxes, are, more, visible, and, easily, hunted, by, humans, food, resources, for, the, bats, become, scarce, after, major, storms, and, flying, foxes, resort, to, riskier, foraging, strategies, such, as, consuming, fallen, fruit, off, the, ground, there, they, are, more, vulnerable, to, depredation, by, domestic, cats, dogs, and, pigs, flying, foxes, are, also, threatened, by, disease, such, as, tick, paralysis, tick, paralysis, affects, the, spectacled, flying, fox, and, is, responsible, for, an, estimated, 1, of, its, annual, mortality, several, species, of, endangered, flying, fox, are, bred, in, captivity, to, augment, their, population, sizes, critically, endangered, livingstone, s, fruit, bats, were, taken, from, the, wild, starting, in, 1995, to, create, a, captive, breeding, program, all, captive, individuals, remain, the, property, of, the, comorian, government, 17, individuals, were, collected, from, the, wild, with, breeding, there, are, 71, in, captivity, as, of, 2017, individuals, are, held, at, the, jersey, zoo, and, the, bristol, zoo, though, the, program, has, been, successful, in, increasing, the, population, caretakers, of, the, captive, population, have, had, to, deal, with, husbandry, issues, such, as, obesity, and, cardiomyopathy, relative, to, their, wild, counterparts, captive, bats, have, a, higher, percentage, of, body, fat, and, a, lower, percentage, of, muscle, mass, the, problem, is, pronounced, in, dominant, males, which, are, the, most, sedentary, addressing, these, concerns, involves, increasing, flight, space, so, that, the, animals, can, exercise, adequately, keepers, are, also, exploring, ways, of, distributing, food, within, enclosures, to, encourage, exercise, the, endangered, rodrigues, flying, fox, has, been, bred, in, captivity, with, great, success, by, 1979, only, 70, 100, individuals, were, left, in, the, world, in, 1976, 25, individuals, were, removed, from, the, wild, by, durrell, wildlife, conservation, trust, to, begin, a, breeding, program, in, 1988, the, breeding, program, was, called, undoubtedly, the, most, important, chiropteran, breeding, project, now, in, operation, by, 2016, there, were, 180, individuals, in, 16, zoos, across, the, united, states, alone, worldwide, 46, zoos, participate, in, the, rodrigues, flying, fox, breeding, program, as, of, 2017, many, flying, foxes, species, are, killed, for, bushmeat, the, bushmeat, harvest, is, often, unsustainable, often, resulting, in, severe, population, decline, or, local, extinction, flying, foxes, are, killed, and, sold, for, bushmeat, in, several, countries, in, southeast, asia, south, asia, and, oceania, including, indonesia, malaysia, papua, new, guinea, the, philippines, bangladesh, china, fiji, and, guam, flying, fox, consumption, is, particularly, common, in, countries, with, low, food, security, and, lack, of, environmental, regulation, in, some, cultures, in, the, region, however, eating, flying, fox, meat, is, taboo, in, namoluk, locals, are, repulsed, by, the, idea, of, eating, flying, foxes, because, the, flying, foxes, urinate, on, themselves, in, predominately, muslim, regions, such, as, much, of, indonesia, flying, foxes, are, rarely, consumed, because, of, halal, dietary, restrictions, north, sulawesi, has, the, greatest, demand, for, flying, fox, bushmeat, despite, being, in, muslim, majority, indonesia, north, sulawesi, is, predominately, christian, therefore, many, locals, do, not, follow, halal, guidelines, prohibiting, flying, fox, consumption, in, manado, most, local, people, consume, flying, fox, meat, at, least, once, a, month, the, frequency, of, flying, fox, consumption, increases, tenfold, around, holidays, locals, believe, that, unique, meat, from, undomesticated, animals, should, be, served, on, special, occasions, to, enliven, the, atmosphere, suggestions, to, make, the, flying, fox, bushmeat, trade, more, sustainable, include, enforcing, a, quota, system, for, harvesting, encouraging, hunters, to, release, female, and, juvenile, individuals, and, providing, economic, alternatives, to, those, who, make, a, living, selling, flying, fox, bushmeat, in, guam, and, the, commonwealth, of, the, northern, mariana, islands, consumption, of, the, mariana, fruit, bat, exposes, locals, to, the, neurotoxin, beta, methylamino, l, alanine, bmaa, which, may, later, lead, to, neurodegenerative, diseases, bmaa, may, become, biomagnified, in, humans, who, consume, flying, foxes, flying, foxes, are, exposed, to, bmaa, by, eating, cycad, fruits, flying, foxes, are, killed, for, use, in, traditional, medicine, the, indian, flying, fox, for, example, has, many, perceived, medical, uses, some, believe, that, its, fat, is, a, treatment, for, rheumatism, tribes, in, the, attappadi, region, of, india, eat, the, cooked, flesh, of, the, indian, flying, fox, to, treat, asthma, and, chest, pain, healers, of, the, kanda, tribe, of, bangladesh, use, hair, from, indian, flying, foxes, to, create, treatments, for, fever, with, shivering, flying, foxes, are, the, natural, reservoirs, of, several, viruses, some, of, which, can, be, transmitted, to, humans, notably, flying, foxes, can, transmit, lyssaviruses, which, cause, rabies, in, australia, the, rabies, virus, is, not, naturally, present, australian, bat, lyssavirus, is, the, only, lyssavirus, present, australian, bat, lyssavirus, was, first, identified, in, 1996, it, is, very, rarely, transmitted, to, humans, transmission, occurs, from, the, bite, or, scratch, of, an, infected, animal, but, can, also, occur, from, getting, the, infected, animal, s, saliva, in, a, mucous, membrane, or, an, open, wound, exposure, to, flying, fox, blood, urine, or, feces, is, not, a, risk, of, exposure, to, australian, bat, lyssavirus, since, 1994, there, have, been, three, records, of, people, getting, infected, with, it, all, three, were, in, queensland, and, each, case, was, fatal, flying, foxes, are, also, reservoirs, of, henipaviruses, such, as, hendra, virus, and, nipah, virus, hendra, virus, was, first, identified, in, 1994, it, also, rarely, occurs, humans, from, 1994, to, 2013, there, have, been, seven, reported, cases, of, hendra, virus, affecting, people, four, of, which, were, fatal, the, hypothesized, primary, route, of, human, infection, is, via, contact, with, horses, that, have, come, into, contact, with, flying, fox, urine, there, are, no, documented, instances, of, direct, transmission, between, flying, foxes, and, humans, as, of, 2012, there, is, a, vaccine, available, for, horses, to, decrease, the, likelihood, of, infection, and, transmission, nipah, virus, was, first, identified, in, 1998, in, malaysia, since, 1998, there, have, been, several, nipah, outbreaks, in, malaysia, singapore, india, and, bangladesh, resulting, in, over, 100, casualties, a, 2018, outbreak, in, kerala, india, resulted, in, 19, humans, infected, of, which, 17, died, the, overall, fatality, rate, is, 40, 75, humans, can, contract, nipah, virus, from, direct, contact, with, flying, foxes, or, their, fluids, through, exposure, to, an, intermediate, host, such, as, domestic, pigs, or, from, contact, with, an, infected, person, a, 2014, study, of, the, indian, flying, fox, and, nipah, virus, found, that, while, nipah, virus, outbreaks, are, more, likely, in, areas, preferred, by, flying, foxes, the, presence, of, bats, in, and, of, itself, is, not, considered, a, risk, factor, for, nipah, virus, infection, rather, the, consumption, of, date, palm, sap, is, a, significant, route, of, transmission, the, practice, of, date, palm, sap, collection, involves, placing, collecting, pots, at, date, palm, trees, indian, flying, foxes, have, been, observed, licking, the, sap, as, it, flows, into, the, pots, as, well, as, defecating, and, urinating, in, proximity, to, the, pots, in, this, way, humans, who, drink, the, palm, sap, can, be, exposed, to, the, bats, viruses, the, use, of, bamboo, skirts, on, collecting, pots, lowers, the, risk, of, contamination, from, bat, fluids, flying, foxes, can, transmit, several, non, lethal, diseases, as, well, such, as, menangle, virus, and, nelson, bay, virus, these, viruses, rarely, affect, humans, and, few, cases, have, been, reported, while, other, bat, species, have, been, suspected, or, implicated, as, the, reservoir, of, diseases, such, as, sars, and, ebola, flying, foxes, are, not, suspected, as, hosts, for, either, causative, virus, flying, foxes, are, often, considered, pests, due, to, the, damage, they, cause, to, orchard, crops, flying, foxes, have, been, cited, as, particularly, destructive, to, almonds, guavas, and, mangoes, in, the, maldives, lychee, in, mauritius, areca, in, india, and, stone, fruits, in, australia, orchard, damages, from, other, animals, are, often, misattributed, to, flying, foxes, though, and, economic, damage, can, be, difficult, to, quantify, or, exaggerated, to, prevent, fruit, damage, farmers, may, legally, or, illegally, cull, flying, foxes, in, the, 1800s, the, australian, government, paid, farmers, bounties, to, kill, flying, foxes, though, the, practice, has, since, been, discontinued, alternatives, to, culling, include, placing, barriers, between, the, bats, and, fruit, trees, such, as, netting, or, harvesting, fruit, in, a, timely, manner, to, avoid, attracting, as, many, flying, foxes, netting, is, the, most, effective, way, to, prevent, crop, loss, though, some, farmers, find, it, cost, prohibitive, it, costs, us, 4, 400, 44, 000, to, net, 1, ha, 2, 5, acres, of, crops, other, methods, of, preventing, fruit, loss, may, also, involve, the, use, of, scare, guns, chemical, deterrents, or, night, time, lights, alternatively, planting, singapore, cherry, trees, and, other, decoy, crops, next, to, an, orchard, can, be, effective, as, flying, foxes, are, much, more, attracted, to, their, fruits, than, many, other, orchard, crops, the, location, of, flying, fox, camps, can, be, a, disturbance, to, humans, in, batemans, bay, australia, locals, report, being, so, disturbed, by, flying, fox, vocalizations, in, the, morning, that, they, lose, sleep, flying, foxes, can, fly, into, power, lines, and, cause, electricity, outages, their, guano, and, body, odor, are, also, unpleasant, to, smell, the, presence, of, flying, fox, colonies, can, cause, nearby, property, values, to, decline, flying, foxes, are, featured, in, many, indigenous, cultures, and, traditions, a, folklore, dreamtime, story, from, the, new, south, wales, north, coast, in, australia, features, an, impatient, flying, fox, wanting, the, great, spirit, to, teach, him, how, to, be, a, bird, only, to, be, hung, upside, down, on, a, branch, they, were, also, featured, in, aboriginal, cave, art, as, evinced, by, several, surviving, examples, in, tonga, flying, foxes, are, considered, sacred, all, flying, foxes, are, the, property, of, the, king, meaning, non, royal, persons, cannot, harm, them, in, any, way, tongan, legend, states, that, a, colony, of, flying, foxes, at, kolovai, are, the, descendants, of, a, pair, of, flying, foxes, gifted, to, the, king, of, tonga, by, the, princess, of, samoa, in, the, indian, village, of, puliangulam, a, colony, of, indian, flying, foxes, roosts, in, a, banyan, tree, villagers, believe, that, the, flying, foxes, are, under, the, protection, of, muni, and, do, not, harm, the, bats, a, shrine, to, muni, is, beneath, the, tree, if, locals, believe, that, they, have, offended, muni, by, failing, to, protect, the, bats, they, will, pray, and, perform, puja, after, offering, sweet, rice, coconut, and, bananas, to, those, attending, the, ceremony, flying, foxes, are, also, featured, in, folk, stories, from, papua, new, guinea, stories, with, flying, foxes, include, a, legend, about, a, cockatoo, stealing, feathers, from, the, flying, fox, resulting, in, it, becoming, nocturnal, another, story, features, a, flying, fox, that, could, transform, into, a, young, man, the, flying, fox, stole, a, woman, away, from, her, husband, to, take, as, his, wife, another, legend, states, that, a, flying, fox, man, was, responsible, for, introducing, yams, to, their, people, indigenous, societies, in, oceania, used, parts, of, flying, foxes, for, functional, and, ceremonial, weapons, in, the, solomon, islands, people, created, barbs, out, of, their, bones, for, use, in, spears, in, new, caledonia, ceremonial, axes, made, of, jade, were, decorated, with, braids, of, flying, fox, fur, flying, fox, wings, were, depicted, on, the, war, shields, of, the, asmat, people, of, indonesia, they, believed, that, the, wings, offered, protection, to, their, warriors, there, are, modern, and, historical, references, to, flying, fox, byproducts, used, as, currency, in, new, caledonia, braided, flying, fox, fur, was, once, used, as, currency, on, the, island, of, makira, which, is, part, of, the, solomon, islands, indigenous, peoples, still, hunt, flying, foxes, for, their, teeth, as, well, as, for, bushmeat, the, canine, teeth, are, strung, together, on, necklaces, that, are, used, as, currency, teeth, of, the, insular, flying, fox, are, particularly, prized, as, they, are, usually, large, enough, to, drill, holes, in, the, makira, flying, fox, is, also, hunted, though, despite, its, smaller, teeth, deterring, local, peoples, from, using, flying, fox, teeth, as, currency, may, be, detrimental, to, the, species, with, lavery, and, fasi, noting, species, that, provide, an, important, cultural, resource, can, be, highly, treasured, emphasizing, sustainable, hunting, of, flying, foxes, to, preserve, cultural, currency, may, be, more, effective, than, encouraging, the, abandonment, of, cultural, currency, even, if, flying, foxes, were, no, longer, hunted, for, their, teeth, they, would, still, be, killed, for, bushmeat, therefore, retaining, their, cultural, value, may, encourage, sustainable, hunting, practices, lavery, stated, it, s, a, positive, not, a, negative, that, their, teeth, are, so, culturally, valuable, the, practice, of, hunting, bats, shouldn, t, necessarily, be, stopped, it, needs, to, be, managed, sustainably, flying, foxes, and, other, bat, species, in, southeast, asia, are, often, killed, and, sold, as, mummies, the, mummified, bodies, or, skeletons, of, these, bats, are, often, shipped, to, the, united, states, where, they, are, sold, in, souvenir, or, curiosity, shops, or, online, through, vendors, such, as, etsy, or, ebay, from, 2000, to, 2013, over, 100, 000, dead, bats, were, imported, to, the, united, states, bat, conservationist, merlin, tuttle, wrote, i, ve, seen, huge, losses, mostly, due, to, various, kinds, of, over, harvesting, especially, at, cave, entrances, either, for, food, or, for, sale, as, mummies, despite, sometimes, being, advertised, as, sustainable, the, practice, could, lead, to, overharvesting, and, depletion, of, flying, fox, species, with, tuttle, saying, it, is, a, virtual, certainty, that, the, bats, you, ve, seen, advertised, are, not, sustainably, harvested
