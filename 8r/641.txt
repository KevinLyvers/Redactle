pucrasia, meleagris, bonasa, tetrastes, centrocercus, dendragapus, tympanuchus, lagopus, falcipennis, canachites, tetrao, lyrurus, and, see, text, tetraonidae, vigors, 1825, tetraoninae, vigors, 1825, grouse, r, a, s, are, a, group, of, birds, from, the, order, galliformes, in, the, family, phasianidae, grouse, are, presently, assigned, to, the, tribe, tetraonini, formerly, the, subfamily, tetraoninae, and, the, family, tetraonidae, a, classification, supported, by, mitochondrial, dna, sequence, studies, and, applied, by, the, american, ornithologists, union, itis, international, ornithological, congress, and, others, grouse, inhabit, temperate, and, subarctic, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, from, pine, forests, to, moorland, and, mountainside, from, 83, n, rock, ptarmigan, in, northern, greenland, to, 28, n, attwater, s, prairie, chicken, in, texas, the, turkeys, are, closely, allied, with, grouse, but, they, have, traditionally, been, excluded, from, tetraonini, often, placed, in, their, own, tribe, subfamily, or, family, certain, more, modern, treatments, also, exclude, them, later, phylogenomic, analyses, demonstrated, conclusively, that, they, are, sister, to, the, traditionally, defined, grouse, and, they, along, with, the, somewhat, earlier, diverging, koklass, pheasant, may, be, treated, as, grouse, i, e, as, basal, members, of, the, tetraonini, this, is, reflected, in, some, more, recent, circumscriptions, like, many, other, galliforms, grouse, are, generally, heavily, built, birds, the, traditional, grouse, excluding, turkeys, range, in, length, from, 31, to, 95, cm, 12, to, 37, 1, 2, in, and, in, weight, from, 0, 3, to, 6, 5, kg, 3, 4, to, 14, 1, 4, lb, if, they, are, included, wild, turkey, toms, are, the, largest, grouse, species, attaining, lengths, of, 130, cm, 50, in, and, weighing, up, to, 10, kg, 22, lb, male, grouse, are, larger, than, females, and, can, be, twice, as, heavy, in, the, western, capercaillie, the, largest, of, the, traditional, grouse, like, many, other, galliforms, males, often, sport, incredibly, elaborate, ornamentation, such, as, crests, fan, tails, and, inflatable, brightly, colored, patches, of, bare, skin, many, grouse, have, feathered, nostrils, and, some, species, such, as, the, ptarmigans, have, legs, which, are, entirely, covered, in, feathers, in, winter, the, toes, too, have, feathers, or, small, scales, on, the, sides, an, adaptation, for, walking, on, snow, and, burrowing, into, it, for, shelter, unlike, many, other, galliforms, they, typically, have, no, spurs, although, turkeys, do, possess, very, prominent, spurs, grouse, feed, mainly, on, vegetation, buds, catkins, leaves, and, twigs, which, typically, accounts, for, over, 95, of, adults, food, by, weight, thus, their, diets, vary, greatly, with, the, seasons, hatchlings, eat, mostly, insects, and, other, invertebrates, gradually, reducing, their, proportion, of, animal, food, to, adult, levels, several, of, the, forest, living, species, are, notable, for, eating, large, quantities, of, conifer, needles, which, most, other, vertebrates, refuse, to, digest, vegetable, food, grouse, have, big, crops, and, gizzards, eat, grit, to, break, up, food, and, have, long, intestines, with, well, developed, caeca, in, which, symbiotic, bacteria, digest, cellulose, forest, species, flock, only, in, autumn, and, winter, though, individuals, tolerate, each, other, when, they, meet, prairie, species, are, more, social, and, tundra, species, ptarmigans, lagopus, are, the, most, social, forming, flocks, of, up, to, 100, in, winter, all, grouse, spend, most, of, their, time, on, the, ground, though, when, alarmed, they, may, take, off, in, a, flurry, and, go, into, a, long, glide, most, species, stay, within, their, breeding, range, all, year, but, make, short, seasonal, movements, many, individuals, of, the, ptarmigan, called, rock, ptarmigan, in, the, us, and, willow, grouse, called, willow, ptarmigan, in, the, us, migrate, hundreds, of, kilometers, in, all, but, one, species, the, willow, ptarmigan, males, are, polygamous, many, species, have, elaborate, courtship, displays, on, the, ground, at, dawn, and, dusk, which, in, some, are, given, in, leks, the, displays, feature, males, brightly, colored, combs, and, in, some, species, brightly, colored, inflatable, sacs, on, the, sides, of, their, necks, the, males, display, their, plumage, give, vocalizations, that, vary, widely, between, species, and, may, engage, in, other, activities, such, as, drumming, or, fluttering, their, wings, rattling, their, tails, and, making, display, flights, occasionally, males, fight, the, nest, is, a, shallow, depression, or, scrape, on, the, ground, often, in, cover, with, a, scanty, lining, of, plant, material, the, female, lays, one, clutch, but, may, replace, it, if, the, eggs, are, lost, she, begins, to, lay, about, a, week, after, mating, and, lays, one, egg, every, day, or, two, the, clutch, comprises, five, to, 12, eggs, the, eggs, have, the, shape, of, hen, s, eggs, and, are, pale, yellow, sparsely, spotted, with, brown, on, laying, the, second, last, or, last, egg, the, female, starts, 21, to, 28, days, of, incubation, chicks, hatch, in, dense, yellow, brown, down, and, leave, the, nest, immediately, they, soon, develop, feathers, and, can, fly, shortly, before, they, are, two, weeks, old, the, female, and, the, male, in, the, willow, grouse, stays, with, them, and, protects, them, until, their, first, autumn, when, they, reach, their, mature, weights, except, in, the, male, capercaillies, they, are, sexually, mature, the, following, spring, but, often, do, not, mate, until, later, years, grouse, make, up, a, considerable, part, of, the, vertebrate, biomass, in, the, arctic, and, subarctic, their, numbers, may, fall, sharply, in, years, of, bad, weather, or, high, predator, populations, significant, grouse, populations, are, a, major, food, source, for, lynx, foxes, martens, and, birds, of, prey, the, three, tundra, species, have, maintained, their, former, numbers, the, prairie, and, forest, species, have, declined, greatly, because, of, habitat, loss, though, popular, game, birds, such, as, the, red, grouse, and, the, ruffed, grouse, have, benefited, from, habitat, management, most, grouse, species, are, listed, by, the, iucn, as, least, concern, or, near, threatened, but, the, greater, and, lesser, prairie, chicken, are, listed, as, vulnerable, and, the, gunnison, grouse, is, listed, as, endangered, some, subspecies, such, as, attwater, s, prairie, chicken, and, the, cantabrian, capercaillie, and, some, national, and, regional, populations, are, also, in, danger, the, wild, turkey, precipitously, declined, before, returning, to, abundance, even, in, developed, areas, the, phenotypic, difference, between, males, and, females, is, called, sexual, dimorphism, male, grouse, tend, to, be, larger, than, female, grouse, which, seems, to, hold, true, across, all, the, species, of, grouse, with, some, difference, within, each, species, in, terms, of, how, drastic, the, size, difference, is, the, hypothesis, with, the, most, supporting, evidence, for, the, evolution, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, grouse, is, sexual, selection, sexual, selection, favors, large, males, stronger, selection, for, larger, size, in, males, leads, to, greater, size, dimorphism, female, size, will, increase, correspondingly, as, male, size, increases, and, this, is, due, to, heredity, but, not, to, the, extent, of, the, male, size, this, is, because, females, that, are, smaller, will, still, be, able, to, reproduce, without, a, substantial, disadvantage, but, this, is, not, the, case, with, males, the, largest, among, the, male, grouse, commonly, dubbed, biggrouse, attract, the, greatest, numbers, of, females, during, their, mating, seasons, male, grouse, display, lekking, behavior, which, is, when, many, males, come, together, in, one, area, and, put, on, displays, to, attract, females, females, selectively, choose, among, the, males, present, for, traits, they, find, more, appealing, male, grouse, exhibit, two, types, typical, lekking, and, exploded, lekking, in, typical, lekking, males, display, in, small, areas, defending, a, limited, territory, and, in, exploded, lekking, displaying, males, are, covered, over, an, expansive, land, area, and, share, larger, territories, male, grouse, can, also, compete, with, one, another, for, access, to, female, grouse, through, territoriality, in, which, a, male, defends, a, territory, which, has, resources, that, females, need, like, food, and, nest, sites, these, differences, in, male, behavior, in, mating, systems, account, for, the, evolution, of, body, size, in, grouse, males, of, territorial, species, were, smaller, than, those, of, exploded, lekking, species, and, males, of, typical, lekking, species, were, the, largest, overall, the, male, birds, that, exhibit, lekking, behavior, and, have, to, compete, with, other, males, for, females, to, choose, them, have, greater, sexual, dimorphism, in, size, this, suggests, the, hypothesis, of, sexual, selection, affecting, male, body, size, and, also, gives, an, explanation, for, why, some, species, of, grouse, have, a, more, drastic, difference, between, male, and, female, body, size, than, others, sexual, size, dimorphism, can, manifest, itself, differently, between, grouse, and, other, birds, in, some, cases, the, female, is, dominant, over, the, male, in, breeding, behavior, which, can, result, in, females, that, are, larger, than, the, males, grouse, are, game, and, hunters, kill, millions, each, year, for, food, sport, and, other, uses, in, the, united, kingdom, this, takes, the, form, of, driven, grouse, shooting, the, male, black, grouse, s, tail, feathers, are, a, traditional, ornament, for, hats, in, areas, such, as, scotland, and, the, alps, folk, dances, from, the, alps, to, the, north, american, prairies, imitate, the, displays, of, lekking, males
