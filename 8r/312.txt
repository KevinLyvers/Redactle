zoology, uk, z, u, l, d, i, zoo, ol, jee, us, z, o, l, d, i, zoh, ol, jee, is, the, scientific, study, of, animals, its, studies, include, the, structure, embryology, classification, habits, and, distribution, of, all, animals, both, living, and, extinct, and, how, they, interact, with, their, ecosystems, zoology, is, one, of, the, primary, branches, of, biology, the, term, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, z, ion, animal, and, logos, knowledge, study, although, humans, have, always, been, interested, in, the, natural, history, of, the, animals, they, saw, around, them, and, used, this, knowledge, to, domesticate, certain, species, the, formal, study, of, zoology, can, be, said, to, have, originated, with, aristotle, he, viewed, animals, as, living, organisms, studied, their, structure, and, development, and, considered, their, adaptations, to, their, surroundings, and, the, function, of, their, parts, modern, zoology, has, its, origins, during, the, renaissance, and, early, modern, period, with, carl, linnaeus, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, robert, hooke, charles, darwin, gregor, mendel, and, many, others, the, study, of, animals, has, largely, moved, on, to, deal, with, form, and, function, adaptations, relationships, between, groups, behaviour, and, ecology, zoology, has, increasingly, been, subdivided, into, disciplines, such, as, classification, physiology, biochemistry, and, evolution, with, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, by, francis, crick, and, james, watson, in, 1953, the, realm, of, molecular, biology, opened, up, leading, to, advances, in, cell, biology, developmental, biology, and, molecular, genetics, the, history, of, zoology, traces, the, study, of, the, animal, kingdom, from, ancient, to, modern, times, prehistoric, people, needed, to, study, the, animals, and, plants, in, their, environment, to, exploit, them, and, survive, cave, paintings, engravings, and, sculptures, in, france, dating, back, 15, 000, years, show, bison, horses, and, deer, in, carefully, rendered, detail, similar, images, from, other, parts, of, the, world, illustrated, mostly, the, animals, hunted, for, food, and, the, savage, animals, the, neolithic, revolution, which, is, characterized, by, the, domestication, of, animals, continued, throughout, antiquity, ancient, knowledge, of, wildlife, is, illustrated, by, the, realistic, depictions, of, wild, and, domestic, animals, in, the, near, east, mesopotamia, and, egypt, including, husbandry, practices, and, techniques, hunting, and, fishing, the, invention, of, writing, is, reflected, in, zoology, by, the, presence, of, animals, in, egyptian, hieroglyphics, although, the, concept, of, zoology, as, a, single, coherent, field, arose, much, later, the, zoological, sciences, emerged, from, natural, history, reaching, back, to, the, biological, works, of, aristotle, and, galen, in, the, ancient, greco, roman, world, in, the, fourth, century, bc, aristotle, looked, at, animals, as, living, organisms, studying, their, structure, development, and, vital, phenomena, he, divided, them, into, two, groups, animals, with, blood, equivalent, to, our, concept, of, vertebrates, and, animals, without, blood, invertebrates, he, spent, two, years, on, lesbos, observing, and, describing, the, animals, and, plants, considering, the, adaptations, of, different, organisms, and, the, function, of, their, parts, four, hundred, years, later, roman, physician, galen, dissected, animals, to, study, their, anatomy, and, the, function, of, the, different, parts, because, the, dissection, of, human, cadavers, was, prohibited, at, the, time, this, resulted, in, some, of, his, conclusions, being, false, but, for, many, centuries, it, was, considered, heretical, to, challenge, any, of, his, views, so, the, study, of, anatomy, stultified, during, the, post, classical, era, middle, eastern, science, and, medicine, was, the, most, advanced, in, the, world, integrating, concepts, from, ancient, greece, rome, mesopotamia, and, persia, as, well, as, the, ancient, indian, tradition, of, ayurveda, while, making, numerous, advances, and, innovations, in, the, 13th, century, albertus, magnus, produced, commentaries, and, paraphrases, of, all, aristotle, s, works, his, books, on, topics, like, botany, zoology, and, minerals, included, information, from, ancient, sources, but, also, the, results, of, his, own, investigations, his, general, approach, was, surprisingly, modern, and, he, wrote, for, it, is, of, natural, science, not, simply, to, accept, what, we, are, told, but, to, inquire, into, the, causes, of, natural, things, an, early, pioneer, was, conrad, gessner, whose, monumental, 4, 500, page, encyclopedia, of, animals, historia, animalium, was, published, in, four, volumes, between, 1551, and, 1558, in, europe, galen, s, work, on, anatomy, remained, largely, unsurpassed, and, unchallenged, up, until, the, 16th, century, during, the, renaissance, and, early, modern, period, zoological, thought, was, revolutionized, in, europe, by, a, renewed, interest, in, empiricism, and, the, discovery, of, many, novel, organisms, prominent, in, this, movement, were, andreas, vesalius, and, william, harvey, who, used, experimentation, and, careful, observation, in, physiology, and, naturalists, such, as, carl, linnaeus, jean, baptiste, lamarck, and, buffon, who, began, to, classify, the, diversity, of, life, and, the, fossil, record, as, well, as, studying, the, development, and, behavior, of, organisms, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, did, pioneering, work, in, microscopy, and, revealed, the, previously, unknown, world, of, microorganisms, laying, the, groundwork, for, cell, theory, van, leeuwenhoek, s, observations, were, endorsed, by, robert, hooke, all, living, organisms, were, composed, of, one, or, more, cells, and, could, not, generate, spontaneously, cell, theory, provided, a, new, perspective, on, the, fundamental, basis, of, life, having, previously, been, the, realm, of, gentlemen, naturalists, over, the, 18th, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, zoology, became, an, increasingly, professional, scientific, discipline, explorer, naturalists, such, as, alexander, von, humboldt, investigated, the, interaction, between, organisms, and, their, environment, and, the, ways, this, relationship, depends, on, geography, laying, the, foundations, for, biogeography, ecology, and, ethology, naturalists, began, to, reject, essentialism, and, consider, the, importance, of, extinction, and, the, mutability, of, species, these, developments, as, well, as, the, results, from, embryology, and, paleontology, were, synthesized, in, the, 1859, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, in, this, darwin, placed, the, theory, of, organic, evolution, on, a, new, footing, by, explaining, the, processes, by, which, it, can, occur, and, providing, observational, evidence, that, it, had, done, so, darwin, s, theory, was, rapidly, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, and, soon, became, a, central, axiom, of, the, rapidly, developing, science, of, biology, the, basis, for, modern, genetics, began, with, the, work, of, gregor, mendel, on, peas, in, 1865, although, the, significance, of, his, work, was, not, realized, at, the, time, darwin, gave, a, new, direction, to, morphology, and, physiology, by, uniting, them, in, a, common, biological, theory, the, theory, of, organic, evolution, the, result, was, a, reconstruction, of, the, classification, of, animals, upon, a, genealogical, basis, fresh, investigation, of, the, development, of, animals, and, early, attempts, to, determine, their, genetic, relationships, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, saw, the, fall, of, spontaneous, generation, and, the, rise, of, the, germ, theory, of, disease, though, the, mechanism, of, inheritance, remained, a, mystery, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, rediscovery, of, mendel, s, work, led, to, the, rapid, development, of, genetics, and, by, the, 1930s, the, combination, of, population, genetics, and, natural, selection, in, the, modern, synthesis, created, evolutionary, biology, research, in, cell, biology, is, interconnected, to, other, fields, such, as, genetics, biochemistry, medical, microbiology, immunology, and, cytochemistry, with, the, determination, of, the, double, helical, structure, of, the, dna, molecule, by, francis, crick, and, james, watson, in, 1953, the, realm, of, molecular, biology, opened, up, leading, to, advances, in, cell, biology, developmental, biology, and, molecular, genetics, the, study, of, systematics, was, transformed, as, dna, sequencing, elucidated, the, degrees, of, affinity, between, different, organisms, zoology, is, the, branch, of, science, dealing, with, animals, a, species, can, be, defined, as, the, largest, group, of, organisms, in, which, any, two, individuals, of, the, appropriate, sex, can, produce, fertile, offspring, about, 1, 5, million, species, of, animal, have, been, described, and, it, has, been, estimated, that, as, many, as, 8, million, animal, species, may, exist, an, early, necessity, was, to, identify, the, organisms, and, group, them, according, to, their, characteristics, differences, and, relationships, and, this, is, the, field, of, the, taxonomist, originally, it, was, thought, that, species, were, immutable, but, with, the, arrival, of, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, the, field, of, cladistics, came, into, being, studying, the, relationships, between, the, different, groups, or, clades, systematics, is, the, study, of, the, diversification, of, living, forms, the, evolutionary, history, of, a, group, is, known, as, its, phylogeny, and, the, relationship, between, the, clades, can, be, shown, diagrammatically, in, a, cladogram, although, someone, who, made, a, scientific, study, of, animals, would, historically, have, described, themselves, as, a, zoologist, the, term, has, come, to, refer, to, those, who, deal, with, individual, animals, with, others, describing, themselves, more, specifically, as, physiologists, ethologists, evolutionary, biologists, ecologists, pharmacologists, endocrinologists, or, parasitologists, although, the, study, of, animal, life, is, ancient, its, scientific, incarnation, is, relatively, modern, this, mirrors, the, transition, from, natural, history, to, biology, at, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, since, hunter, and, cuvier, comparative, anatomical, study, has, been, associated, with, morphography, shaping, the, modern, areas, of, zoological, investigation, anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, teratology, and, ethology, modern, zoology, first, arose, in, german, and, british, universities, in, britain, thomas, henry, huxley, was, a, prominent, figure, his, ideas, were, centered, on, the, morphology, of, animals, many, consider, him, the, greatest, comparative, anatomist, of, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, similar, to, hunter, his, courses, were, composed, of, lectures, and, laboratory, practical, classes, in, contrast, to, the, previous, format, of, lectures, only, scientific, classification, in, zoology, is, a, method, by, which, zoologists, group, and, categorize, organisms, by, biological, type, such, as, genus, or, species, biological, classification, is, a, form, of, scientific, taxonomy, modern, biological, classification, has, its, root, in, the, work, of, carl, linnaeus, who, grouped, species, according, to, shared, physical, characteristics, these, groupings, have, since, been, revised, to, improve, consistency, with, the, darwinian, principle, of, common, descent, molecular, phylogenetics, which, uses, nucleic, acid, sequence, as, data, has, driven, many, recent, revisions, and, is, likely, to, continue, to, do, so, biological, classification, belongs, to, the, science, of, zoological, systematics, many, scientists, now, consider, the, five, kingdom, system, outdated, modern, alternative, classification, systems, generally, start, with, the, three, domain, system, archaea, originally, archaebacteria, bacteria, originally, eubacteria, eukaryota, including, protists, fungi, plants, and, animals, these, domains, reflect, whether, the, cells, have, nuclei, or, not, as, well, as, differences, in, the, chemical, composition, of, the, cell, exteriors, further, each, kingdom, is, broken, down, recursively, until, each, species, is, separately, classified, the, order, is, domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, the, scientific, name, of, an, organism, is, generated, from, its, genus, and, species, for, example, humans, are, listed, as, homo, sapiens, homo, is, the, genus, and, sapiens, the, specific, epithet, both, of, them, combined, make, up, the, species, name, when, writing, the, scientific, name, of, an, organism, it, is, proper, to, capitalize, the, first, letter, in, the, genus, and, put, all, of, the, specific, epithet, in, lowercase, additionally, the, entire, term, may, be, italicized, or, underlined, the, dominant, classification, system, is, called, the, linnaean, taxonomy, it, includes, ranks, and, binomial, nomenclature, the, classification, taxonomy, and, nomenclature, of, zoological, organisms, is, administered, by, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, a, merging, draft, biocode, was, published, in, 1997, in, an, attempt, to, standardize, nomenclature, but, has, yet, to, be, formally, adopted, vertebrate, zoology, is, the, biological, discipline, that, consists, of, the, study, of, vertebrate, animals, that, is, animals, with, a, backbone, such, as, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, the, various, taxonomically, oriented, disciplines, such, as, mammalogy, biological, anthropology, herpetology, ornithology, and, ichthyology, seek, to, identify, and, classify, species, and, study, the, structures, and, mechanisms, specific, to, those, groups, the, rest, of, the, animal, kingdom, is, dealt, with, by, invertebrate, zoology, a, vast, and, very, diverse, group, of, animals, that, includes, sponges, echinoderms, tunicates, worms, molluscs, arthropods, and, many, other, phyla, but, single, celled, organisms, or, protists, are, not, usually, included, cell, biology, studies, the, structural, and, physiological, properties, of, cells, including, their, behavior, interactions, and, environment, this, is, done, on, both, the, microscopic, and, molecular, levels, for, single, celled, organisms, such, as, bacteria, as, well, as, the, specialized, cells, in, multicellular, organisms, such, as, humans, understanding, the, structure, and, function, of, cells, is, fundamental, to, all, of, the, biological, sciences, the, similarities, and, differences, between, cell, types, are, particularly, relevant, to, molecular, biology, anatomy, considers, the, forms, of, macroscopic, structures, such, as, organs, and, organ, systems, it, focuses, on, how, organs, and, organ, systems, work, together, in, the, bodies, of, humans, and, other, animals, in, addition, to, how, they, work, independently, anatomy, and, cell, biology, are, two, studies, that, are, closely, related, and, can, be, categorized, under, structural, studies, comparative, anatomy, is, the, study, of, similarities, and, differences, in, the, anatomy, of, different, groups, it, is, closely, related, to, evolutionary, biology, and, phylogeny, the, evolution, of, species, physiology, studies, the, mechanical, physical, and, biochemical, processes, of, living, organisms, by, attempting, to, understand, how, all, of, the, structures, function, as, a, whole, the, theme, of, structure, to, function, is, central, to, biology, physiological, studies, have, traditionally, been, divided, into, plant, physiology, and, animal, physiology, but, some, principles, of, physiology, are, universal, no, matter, what, particular, organism, is, being, studied, for, example, what, is, learned, about, the, physiology, of, yeast, cells, can, also, apply, to, human, cells, the, field, of, animal, physiology, extends, the, tools, and, methods, of, human, physiology, to, non, human, species, physiology, studies, how, for, example, the, nervous, immune, endocrine, respiratory, and, circulatory, systems, function, and, interact, developmental, biology, is, the, study, of, the, processes, by, which, animals, and, plants, reproduce, and, grow, the, discipline, includes, the, study, of, embryonic, development, cellular, differentiation, regeneration, asexual, and, sexual, reproduction, metamorphosis, and, the, growth, and, differentiation, of, stem, cells, in, the, adult, organism, development, of, both, animals, and, plants, is, further, considered, in, the, articles, on, evolution, population, genetics, heredity, genetic, variability, mendelian, inheritance, and, reproduction, evolutionary, biology, is, the, subfield, of, biology, that, studies, the, evolutionary, processes, natural, selection, common, descent, speciation, that, produced, the, diversity, of, life, on, earth, evolutionary, research, is, concerned, with, the, origin, and, descent, of, species, as, well, as, their, change, over, time, and, includes, scientists, from, many, taxonomically, oriented, disciplines, for, example, it, generally, involves, scientists, who, have, special, training, in, particular, organisms, such, as, mammalogy, ornithology, herpetology, or, entomology, but, use, those, organisms, as, systems, to, answer, general, questions, about, evolution, evolutionary, biology, is, partly, based, on, paleontology, which, uses, the, fossil, record, to, answer, questions, about, the, mode, and, tempo, of, evolution, and, partly, on, the, developments, in, areas, such, as, population, genetics, and, evolutionary, theory, following, the, development, of, dna, fingerprinting, techniques, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, application, of, these, techniques, in, zoology, has, increased, the, understanding, of, animal, populations, in, the, 1980s, developmental, biology, re, entered, evolutionary, biology, from, its, initial, exclusion, from, the, modern, synthesis, through, the, study, of, evolutionary, developmental, biology, related, fields, often, considered, part, of, evolutionary, biology, are, phylogenetics, systematics, and, taxonomy, ethology, is, the, scientific, and, objective, study, of, animal, behavior, under, natural, conditions, as, opposed, to, behaviorism, which, focuses, on, behavioral, response, studies, in, a, laboratory, setting, ethologists, have, been, particularly, concerned, with, the, evolution, of, behavior, and, the, understanding, of, behavior, in, terms, of, the, theory, of, natural, selection, in, one, sense, the, first, modern, ethologist, was, charles, darwin, whose, book, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, influenced, many, future, ethologists, a, subfield, of, ethology, is, behavioral, ecology, which, attempts, to, answer, nikolaas, tinbergen, s, four, questions, with, regard, to, animal, behavior, what, are, the, proximate, causes, of, the, behavior, the, developmental, history, of, the, organism, the, survival, value, and, phylogeny, of, the, behavior, another, area, of, study, is, animal, cognition, which, uses, laboratory, experiments, and, carefully, controlled, field, studies, to, investigate, an, animal, s, intelligence, and, learning, biogeography, studies, the, spatial, distribution, of, organisms, on, the, earth, focusing, on, topics, like, dispersal, and, migration, plate, tectonics, climate, change, and, cladistics, it, is, an, integrative, field, of, study, uniting, concepts, and, information, from, evolutionary, biology, taxonomy, ecology, physical, geography, geology, paleontology, and, climatology, the, origin, of, this, field, of, study, is, widely, accredited, to, alfred, russel, wallace, a, british, biologist, who, had, some, of, his, work, jointly, published, with, charles, darwin, molecular, biology, studies, the, common, genetic, and, developmental, mechanisms, of, animals, and, plants, attempting, to, answer, the, questions, regarding, the, mechanisms, of, genetic, inheritance, and, the, structure, of, the, gene, in, 1953, james, watson, and, francis, crick, described, the, structure, of, dna, and, the, interactions, within, the, molecule, and, this, publication, jump, started, research, into, molecular, biology, and, increased, interest, in, the, subject, while, researchers, practice, techniques, specific, to, molecular, biology, it, is, common, to, combine, these, with, methods, from, genetics, and, biochemistry, much, of, molecular, biology, is, quantitative, and, recently, a, significant, amount, of, work, has, been, done, using, computer, science, techniques, such, as, bioinformatics, and, computational, biology, molecular, genetics, the, study, of, gene, structure, and, function, has, been, among, the, most, prominent, sub, fields, of, molecular, biology, since, the, early, 2000s, other, branches, of, biology, are, informed, by, molecular, biology, by, either, directly, studying, the, interactions, of, molecules, in, their, own, right, such, as, in, cell, biology, and, developmental, biology, or, indirectly, where, molecular, techniques, are, used, to, infer, historical, attributes, of, populations, or, species, as, in, fields, in, evolutionary, biology, such, as, population, genetics, and, phylogenetics, there, is, also, a, long, tradition, of, studying, biomolecules, from, the, ground, up, or, molecularly, in, biophysics, animals, generally, reproduce, by, sexual, reproduction, a, process, involving, the, union, of, a, male, and, female, haploid, gamete, each, gamete, formed, by, meiosis, ordinarily, gametes, produced, by, separate, individuals, unite, by, a, process, of, fertilization, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, that, can, then, develop, into, a, genetically, unique, individual, progeny, however, some, animals, are, also, capable, as, an, alternative, reproductive, process, to, reproduce, parthenogenetically, parthenogenesis, has, been, described, in, snakes, and, lizards, see, wikipedia, parthenogenesis, in, squamates, in, amphibians, see, wikipedia, parthenogenesis, in, amphibians, and, in, numerous, other, species, see, wikipedia, parthenogenesis, generally, meiosis, in, parthanogenetically, reproducing, animals, occurs, by, a, similar, process, to, that, in, sexually, reproducing, animals, but, the, diploid, zygote, nucleus, is, generated, by, the, union, of, two, haploid, genomes, from, the, same, individual, rather, than, from, different, individuals
