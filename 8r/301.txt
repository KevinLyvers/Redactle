an, ecosystem, or, ecological, system, is, a, system, that, environments, and, their, organisms, form, through, their, interaction, 458, the, biotic, and, abiotic, components, are, linked, together, through, nutrient, cycles, and, energy, flows, ecosystems, are, controlled, by, external, and, internal, factors, external, factors, such, as, climate, parent, material, which, forms, the, soil, and, topography, control, the, overall, structure, of, an, ecosystem, but, are, not, themselves, influenced, by, the, ecosystem, internal, factors, are, controlled, for, example, by, decomposition, root, competition, shading, disturbance, succession, and, the, types, of, species, present, while, the, resource, inputs, are, generally, controlled, by, external, processes, the, availability, of, these, resources, within, the, ecosystem, is, controlled, by, internal, factors, therefore, internal, factors, not, only, control, ecosystem, processes, but, are, also, controlled, by, them, ecosystems, are, dynamic, entities, they, are, subject, to, periodic, disturbances, and, are, always, in, the, process, of, recovering, from, some, past, disturbance, the, tendency, of, an, ecosystem, to, remain, close, to, its, equilibrium, state, despite, that, disturbance, is, termed, its, resistance, the, capacity, of, a, system, to, absorb, disturbance, and, reorganize, while, undergoing, change, so, as, to, retain, essentially, the, same, function, structure, identity, and, feedbacks, is, termed, its, ecological, resilience, ecosystems, can, be, studied, through, a, variety, of, approaches, theoretical, studies, studies, monitoring, specific, ecosystems, over, long, periods, of, time, those, that, look, at, differences, between, ecosystems, to, elucidate, how, they, work, and, direct, manipulative, experimentation, biomes, are, general, classes, or, categories, of, ecosystems, however, there, is, no, clear, distinction, between, biomes, and, ecosystems, ecosystem, classifications, are, specific, kinds, of, ecological, classifications, that, consider, all, four, elements, of, the, definition, of, ecosystems, a, biotic, component, an, abiotic, complex, the, interactions, between, and, within, them, and, the, physical, space, they, occupy, biotic, factors, of, the, ecosystem, are, living, things, such, as, plants, animals, and, bacteria, while, abiotic, are, non, living, components, such, as, water, soil, and, atmosphere, plants, allow, energy, to, enter, the, system, through, photosynthesis, building, up, plant, tissue, animals, play, an, important, role, in, the, movement, of, matter, and, energy, through, the, system, by, feeding, on, plants, and, on, one, another, they, also, influence, the, quantity, of, plant, and, microbial, biomass, present, by, breaking, down, dead, organic, matter, decomposers, release, carbon, back, to, the, atmosphere, and, facilitate, nutrient, cycling, by, converting, nutrients, stored, in, dead, biomass, back, to, a, form, that, can, be, readily, used, by, plants, and, microbes, ecosystems, provide, a, variety, of, goods, and, services, upon, which, people, depend, and, may, be, part, of, ecosystem, goods, include, the, tangible, material, products, of, ecosystem, processes, such, as, water, food, fuel, construction, material, and, medicinal, plants, ecosystem, services, on, the, other, hand, are, generally, improvements, in, the, condition, or, location, of, things, of, value, these, include, things, like, the, maintenance, of, hydrological, cycles, cleaning, air, and, water, the, maintenance, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, crop, pollination, and, even, things, like, beauty, inspiration, and, opportunities, for, research, many, ecosystems, become, degraded, through, human, impacts, such, as, soil, loss, air, and, water, pollution, habitat, fragmentation, water, diversion, fire, suppression, and, introduced, species, and, invasive, species, these, threats, can, lead, to, abrupt, transformation, of, the, ecosystem, or, to, gradual, disruption, of, biotic, processes, and, degradation, of, abiotic, conditions, of, the, ecosystem, once, the, original, ecosystem, has, lost, its, defining, features, it, is, considered, collapsed, ecosystem, restoration, can, contribute, to, achieving, the, sustainable, development, goals, an, ecosystem, or, ecological, system, consists, of, all, the, organisms, and, the, abiotic, pools, or, physical, environment, with, which, they, interact, 5, 458, the, biotic, and, abiotic, components, are, linked, together, through, nutrient, cycles, and, energy, flows, ecosystem, processes, are, the, transfers, of, energy, and, materials, from, one, pool, to, another, 458, ecosystem, processes, are, known, to, take, place, at, a, wide, range, of, scales, therefore, the, correct, scale, of, study, depends, on, the, question, asked, 5, the, term, ecosystem, was, first, used, in, 1935, in, a, publication, by, british, ecologist, arthur, tansley, the, term, was, coined, by, arthur, roy, clapham, who, came, up, with, the, word, at, tansley, s, request, tansley, devised, the, concept, to, draw, attention, to, the, importance, of, transfers, of, materials, between, organisms, and, their, environment, 9, he, later, refined, the, term, describing, it, as, the, whole, system, including, not, only, the, organism, complex, but, also, the, whole, complex, of, physical, factors, forming, what, we, call, the, environment, tansley, regarded, ecosystems, not, simply, as, natural, units, but, as, mental, isolates, tansley, later, defined, the, spatial, extent, of, ecosystems, using, the, term, ecotope, g, evelyn, hutchinson, a, limnologist, who, was, a, contemporary, of, tansley, s, combined, charles, elton, s, ideas, about, trophic, ecology, with, those, of, russian, geochemist, vladimir, vernadsky, as, a, result, he, suggested, that, mineral, nutrient, availability, in, a, lake, limited, algal, production, this, would, in, turn, limit, the, abundance, of, animals, that, feed, on, algae, raymond, lindeman, took, these, ideas, further, to, suggest, that, the, flow, of, energy, through, a, lake, was, the, primary, driver, of, the, ecosystem, hutchinson, s, students, brothers, howard, t, odum, and, eugene, p, odum, further, developed, a, systems, approach, to, the, study, of, ecosystems, this, allowed, them, to, study, the, flow, of, energy, and, material, through, ecological, systems, 9, ecosystems, are, controlled, by, both, external, and, internal, factors, external, factors, also, called, state, factors, control, the, overall, structure, of, an, ecosystem, and, the, way, things, work, within, it, but, are, not, themselves, influenced, by, the, ecosystem, on, broad, geographic, scales, climate, is, the, factor, that, most, strongly, determines, ecosystem, processes, and, structure, 14, climate, determines, the, biome, in, which, the, ecosystem, is, embedded, rainfall, patterns, and, seasonal, temperatures, influence, photosynthesis, and, thereby, determine, the, amount, of, energy, available, to, the, ecosystem, 145, parent, material, determines, the, nature, of, the, soil, in, an, ecosystem, and, influences, the, supply, of, mineral, nutrients, topography, also, controls, ecosystem, processes, by, affecting, things, like, microclimate, soil, development, and, the, movement, of, water, through, a, system, for, example, ecosystems, can, be, quite, different, if, situated, in, a, small, depression, on, the, landscape, versus, one, present, on, an, adjacent, steep, hillside, 39, 66, other, external, factors, that, play, an, important, role, in, ecosystem, functioning, include, time, and, potential, biota, the, organisms, that, are, present, in, a, region, and, could, potentially, occupy, a, particular, site, ecosystems, in, similar, environments, that, are, located, in, different, parts, of, the, world, can, end, up, doing, things, very, differently, simply, because, they, have, different, pools, of, species, present, 321, the, introduction, of, non, native, species, can, cause, substantial, shifts, in, ecosystem, function, unlike, external, factors, internal, factors, in, ecosystems, not, only, control, ecosystem, processes, but, are, also, controlled, by, them, 16, while, the, resource, inputs, are, generally, controlled, by, external, processes, like, climate, and, parent, material, the, availability, of, these, resources, within, the, ecosystem, is, controlled, by, internal, factors, like, decomposition, root, competition, or, shading, other, factors, like, disturbance, succession, or, the, types, of, species, present, are, also, internal, factors, primary, production, is, the, production, of, organic, matter, from, inorganic, carbon, sources, this, mainly, occurs, through, photosynthesis, the, energy, incorporated, through, this, process, supports, life, on, earth, while, the, carbon, makes, up, much, of, the, organic, matter, in, living, and, dead, biomass, soil, carbon, and, fossil, fuels, it, also, drives, the, carbon, cycle, which, influences, global, climate, via, the, greenhouse, effect, through, the, process, of, photosynthesis, plants, capture, energy, from, light, and, use, it, to, combine, carbon, dioxide, and, water, to, produce, carbohydrates, and, oxygen, the, photosynthesis, carried, out, by, all, the, plants, in, an, ecosystem, is, called, the, gross, primary, production, gpp, 124, about, half, of, the, gross, gpp, is, respired, by, plants, in, order, to, provide, the, energy, that, supports, their, growth, and, maintenance, 157, the, remainder, that, portion, of, gpp, that, is, not, used, up, by, respiration, is, known, as, the, net, primary, production, npp, 157, total, photosynthesis, is, limited, by, a, range, of, environmental, factors, these, include, the, amount, of, light, available, the, amount, of, leaf, area, a, plant, has, to, capture, light, shading, by, other, plants, is, a, major, limitation, of, photosynthesis, the, rate, at, which, carbon, dioxide, can, be, supplied, to, the, chloroplasts, to, support, photosynthesis, the, availability, of, water, and, the, availability, of, suitable, temperatures, for, carrying, out, photosynthesis, 155, energy, and, carbon, enter, ecosystems, through, photosynthesis, are, incorporated, into, living, tissue, transferred, to, other, organisms, that, feed, on, the, living, and, dead, plant, matter, and, eventually, released, through, respiration, 157, the, carbon, and, energy, incorporated, into, plant, tissues, net, primary, production, is, either, consumed, by, animals, while, the, plant, is, alive, or, it, remains, uneaten, when, the, plant, tissue, dies, and, becomes, detritus, in, terrestrial, ecosystems, the, vast, majority, of, the, net, primary, production, ends, up, being, broken, down, by, decomposers, the, remainder, is, consumed, by, animals, while, still, alive, and, enters, the, plant, based, trophic, system, after, plants, and, animals, die, the, organic, matter, contained, in, them, enters, the, detritus, based, trophic, system, ecosystem, respiration, is, the, sum, of, respiration, by, all, living, organisms, plants, animals, and, decomposers, in, the, ecosystem, net, ecosystem, production, is, the, difference, between, gross, primary, production, gpp, and, ecosystem, respiration, in, the, absence, of, disturbance, net, ecosystem, production, is, equivalent, to, the, net, carbon, accumulation, in, the, ecosystem, energy, can, also, be, released, from, an, ecosystem, through, disturbances, such, as, wildfire, or, transferred, to, other, ecosystems, e, g, from, a, forest, to, a, stream, to, a, lake, by, erosion, in, aquatic, systems, the, proportion, of, plant, biomass, that, gets, consumed, by, herbivores, is, much, higher, than, in, terrestrial, systems, in, trophic, systems, photosynthetic, organisms, are, the, primary, producers, the, organisms, that, consume, their, tissues, are, called, primary, consumers, or, secondary, producers, herbivores, organisms, which, feed, on, microbes, bacteria, and, fungi, are, termed, microbivores, animals, that, feed, on, primary, consumers, carnivores, are, secondary, consumers, each, of, these, constitutes, a, trophic, level, the, sequence, of, consumption, from, plant, to, herbivore, to, carnivore, forms, a, food, chain, real, systems, are, much, more, complex, than, this, organisms, will, generally, feed, on, more, than, one, form, of, food, and, may, feed, at, more, than, one, trophic, level, carnivores, may, capture, some, prey, that, is, part, of, a, plant, based, trophic, system, and, others, that, are, part, of, a, detritus, based, trophic, system, a, bird, that, feeds, both, on, herbivorous, grasshoppers, and, earthworms, which, consume, detritus, real, systems, with, all, these, complexities, form, food, webs, rather, than, food, chains, which, present, a, number, of, common, non, random, properties, in, the, topology, of, their, network, the, carbon, and, nutrients, in, dead, organic, matter, are, broken, down, by, a, group, of, processes, known, as, decomposition, this, releases, nutrients, that, can, then, be, re, used, for, plant, and, microbial, production, and, returns, carbon, dioxide, to, the, atmosphere, or, water, where, it, can, be, used, for, photosynthesis, in, the, absence, of, decomposition, the, dead, organic, matter, would, accumulate, in, an, ecosystem, and, nutrients, and, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, would, be, depleted, 183, decomposition, processes, can, be, separated, into, three, categories, leaching, fragmentation, and, chemical, alteration, of, dead, material, as, water, moves, through, dead, organic, matter, it, dissolves, and, carries, with, it, the, water, soluble, components, these, are, then, taken, up, by, organisms, in, the, soil, react, with, mineral, soil, or, are, transported, beyond, the, confines, of, the, ecosystem, and, are, considered, lost, to, it, 271, 280, newly, shed, leaves, and, newly, dead, animals, have, high, concentrations, of, water, soluble, components, and, include, sugars, amino, acids, and, mineral, nutrients, leaching, is, more, important, in, wet, environments, and, less, important, in, dry, ones, 69, 77, fragmentation, processes, break, organic, material, into, smaller, pieces, exposing, new, surfaces, for, colonization, by, microbes, freshly, shed, leaf, litter, may, be, inaccessible, due, to, an, outer, layer, of, cuticle, or, bark, and, cell, contents, are, protected, by, a, cell, wall, newly, dead, animals, may, be, covered, by, an, exoskeleton, fragmentation, processes, which, break, through, these, protective, layers, accelerate, the, rate, of, microbial, decomposition, 184, animals, fragment, detritus, as, they, hunt, for, food, as, does, passage, through, the, gut, freeze, thaw, cycles, and, cycles, of, wetting, and, drying, also, fragment, dead, material, 186, the, chemical, alteration, of, the, dead, organic, matter, is, primarily, achieved, through, bacterial, and, fungal, action, fungal, hyphae, produce, enzymes, that, can, break, through, the, tough, outer, structures, surrounding, dead, plant, material, they, also, produce, enzymes, that, break, down, lignin, which, allows, them, access, to, both, cell, contents, and, the, nitrogen, in, the, lignin, fungi, can, transfer, carbon, and, nitrogen, through, their, hyphal, networks, and, thus, unlike, bacteria, are, not, dependent, solely, on, locally, available, resources, 186, decomposition, rates, vary, among, ecosystems, the, rate, of, decomposition, is, governed, by, three, sets, of, factors, the, physical, environment, temperature, moisture, and, soil, properties, the, quantity, and, quality, of, the, dead, material, available, to, decomposers, and, the, nature, of, the, microbial, community, itself, 194, temperature, controls, the, rate, of, microbial, respiration, the, higher, the, temperature, the, faster, the, microbial, decomposition, occurs, temperature, also, affects, soil, moisture, which, affects, decomposition, freeze, thaw, cycles, also, affect, decomposition, freezing, temperatures, kill, soil, microorganisms, which, allows, leaching, to, play, a, more, important, role, in, moving, nutrients, around, this, can, be, especially, important, as, the, soil, thaws, in, the, spring, creating, a, pulse, of, nutrients, that, become, available, 280, decomposition, rates, are, low, under, very, wet, or, very, dry, conditions, decomposition, rates, are, highest, in, wet, moist, conditions, with, adequate, levels, of, oxygen, wet, soils, tend, to, become, deficient, in, oxygen, this, is, especially, true, in, wetlands, which, slows, microbial, growth, in, dry, soils, decomposition, slows, as, well, but, bacteria, continue, to, grow, albeit, at, a, slower, rate, even, after, soils, become, too, dry, to, support, plant, growth, 200, ecosystems, are, dynamic, entities, they, are, subject, to, periodic, disturbances, and, are, always, in, the, process, of, recovering, from, past, disturbances, 347, when, a, perturbation, occurs, an, ecosystem, responds, by, moving, away, from, its, initial, state, the, tendency, of, an, ecosystem, to, remain, close, to, its, equilibrium, state, despite, that, disturbance, is, termed, its, resistance, the, capacity, of, a, system, to, absorb, disturbance, and, reorganize, while, undergoing, change, so, as, to, retain, essentially, the, same, function, structure, identity, and, feedbacks, is, termed, its, ecological, resilience, resilience, thinking, also, includes, humanity, as, an, integral, part, of, the, biosphere, where, we, are, dependent, on, ecosystem, services, for, our, survival, and, must, build, and, maintain, their, natural, capacities, to, withstand, shocks, and, disturbances, time, plays, a, central, role, over, a, wide, range, for, example, in, the, slow, development, of, soil, from, bare, rock, and, the, faster, recovery, of, a, community, from, disturbance, 67, disturbance, also, plays, an, important, role, in, ecological, processes, f, stuart, chapin, and, coauthors, define, disturbance, as, a, relatively, discrete, event, in, time, that, removes, plant, biomass, 346, this, can, range, from, herbivore, outbreaks, treefalls, fires, hurricanes, floods, glacial, advances, to, volcanic, eruptions, such, disturbances, can, cause, large, changes, in, plant, animal, and, microbe, populations, as, well, as, soil, organic, matter, content, disturbance, is, followed, by, succession, a, directional, change, in, ecosystem, structure, and, functioning, resulting, from, biotically, driven, changes, in, resource, supply, 470, the, frequency, and, severity, of, disturbance, determine, the, way, it, affects, ecosystem, function, a, major, disturbance, like, a, volcanic, eruption, or, glacial, advance, and, retreat, leave, behind, soils, that, lack, plants, animals, or, organic, matter, ecosystems, that, experience, such, disturbances, undergo, primary, succession, a, less, severe, disturbance, like, forest, fires, hurricanes, or, cultivation, result, in, secondary, succession, and, a, faster, recovery, 348, more, severe, and, more, frequent, disturbance, result, in, longer, recovery, times, from, one, year, to, another, ecosystems, experience, variation, in, their, biotic, and, abiotic, environments, a, drought, a, colder, than, usual, winter, and, a, pest, outbreak, all, are, short, term, variability, in, environmental, conditions, animal, populations, vary, from, year, to, year, building, up, during, resource, rich, periods, and, crashing, as, they, overshoot, their, food, supply, longer, term, changes, also, shape, ecosystem, processes, for, example, the, forests, of, eastern, north, america, still, show, legacies, of, cultivation, which, ceased, in, 1850, when, large, areas, were, reverted, to, forests, 340, another, example, is, the, methane, production, in, eastern, siberian, lakes, that, is, controlled, by, organic, matter, which, accumulated, during, the, pleistocene, ecosystems, continually, exchange, energy, and, carbon, with, the, wider, environment, mineral, nutrients, on, the, other, hand, are, mostly, cycled, back, and, forth, between, plants, animals, microbes, and, the, soil, most, nitrogen, enters, ecosystems, through, biological, nitrogen, fixation, is, deposited, through, precipitation, dust, gases, or, is, applied, as, fertilizer, 266, most, terrestrial, ecosystems, are, nitrogen, limited, in, the, short, term, making, nitrogen, cycling, an, important, control, on, ecosystem, production, 289, over, the, long, term, phosphorus, availability, can, also, be, critical, macronutrients, which, are, required, by, all, plants, in, large, quantities, include, the, primary, nutrients, which, are, most, limiting, as, they, are, used, in, largest, amounts, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, 231, secondary, major, nutrients, less, often, limiting, include, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, micronutrients, required, by, all, plants, in, small, quantities, include, boron, chloride, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, zinc, finally, there, are, also, beneficial, nutrients, which, may, be, required, by, certain, plants, or, by, plants, under, specific, environmental, conditions, aluminum, cobalt, iodine, nickel, selenium, silicon, sodium, vanadium, 231, until, modern, times, nitrogen, fixation, was, the, major, source, of, nitrogen, for, ecosystems, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, either, live, symbiotically, with, plants, or, live, freely, in, the, soil, the, energetic, cost, is, high, for, plants, that, support, nitrogen, fixing, symbionts, as, much, as, 25, of, gross, primary, production, when, measured, in, controlled, conditions, many, members, of, the, legume, plant, family, support, nitrogen, fixing, symbionts, some, cyanobacteria, are, also, capable, of, nitrogen, fixation, these, are, phototrophs, which, carry, out, photosynthesis, like, other, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, they, can, either, be, free, living, or, have, symbiotic, relationships, with, plants, 360, other, sources, of, nitrogen, include, acid, deposition, produced, through, the, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, ammonia, gas, which, evaporates, from, agricultural, fields, which, have, had, fertilizers, applied, to, them, and, dust, 270, anthropogenic, nitrogen, inputs, account, for, about, 80, of, all, nitrogen, fluxes, in, ecosystems, 270, when, plant, tissues, are, shed, or, are, eaten, the, nitrogen, in, those, tissues, becomes, available, to, animals, and, microbes, microbial, decomposition, releases, nitrogen, compounds, from, dead, organic, matter, in, the, soil, where, plants, fungi, and, bacteria, compete, for, it, some, soil, bacteria, use, organic, nitrogen, containing, compounds, as, a, source, of, carbon, and, release, ammonium, ions, into, the, soil, this, process, is, known, as, nitrogen, mineralization, others, convert, ammonium, to, nitrite, and, nitrate, ions, a, process, known, as, nitrification, nitric, oxide, and, nitrous, oxide, are, also, produced, during, nitrification, 277, under, nitrogen, rich, and, oxygen, poor, conditions, nitrates, and, nitrites, are, converted, to, nitrogen, gas, a, process, known, as, denitrification, 281, mycorrhizal, fungi, which, are, symbiotic, with, plant, roots, use, carbohydrates, supplied, by, the, plants, and, in, return, transfer, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, compounds, back, to, the, plant, roots, this, is, an, important, pathway, of, organic, nitrogen, transfer, from, dead, organic, matter, to, plants, this, mechanism, may, contribute, to, more, than, 70, tg, of, annually, assimilated, plant, nitrogen, thereby, playing, a, critical, role, in, global, nutrient, cycling, and, ecosystem, function, phosphorus, enters, ecosystems, through, weathering, as, ecosystems, age, this, supply, diminishes, making, phosphorus, limitation, more, common, in, older, landscapes, especially, in, the, tropics, 287, 290, calcium, and, sulfur, are, also, produced, by, weathering, but, acid, deposition, is, an, important, source, of, sulfur, in, many, ecosystems, although, magnesium, and, manganese, are, produced, by, weathering, exchanges, between, soil, organic, matter, and, living, cells, account, for, a, significant, portion, of, ecosystem, fluxes, potassium, is, primarily, cycled, between, living, cells, and, soil, organic, matter, 291, biodiversity, plays, an, important, role, in, ecosystem, functioning, 449, 453, ecosystem, processes, are, driven, by, the, species, in, an, ecosystem, the, nature, of, the, individual, species, and, the, relative, abundance, of, organisms, among, these, species, ecosystem, processes, are, the, net, effect, of, the, actions, of, individual, organisms, as, they, interact, with, their, environment, ecological, theory, suggests, that, in, order, to, coexist, species, must, have, some, level, of, limiting, similarity, they, must, be, different, from, one, another, in, some, fundamental, way, otherwise, one, species, would, competitively, exclude, the, other, despite, this, the, cumulative, effect, of, additional, species, in, an, ecosystem, is, not, linear, additional, species, may, enhance, nitrogen, retention, for, example, however, beyond, some, level, of, species, richness, 331, additional, species, may, have, little, additive, effect, unless, they, differ, substantially, from, species, already, present, 324, this, is, the, case, for, example, for, exotic, species, 321, the, addition, or, loss, of, species, that, are, ecologically, similar, to, those, already, present, in, an, ecosystem, tends, to, only, have, a, small, effect, on, ecosystem, function, ecologically, distinct, species, on, the, other, hand, have, a, much, larger, effect, similarly, dominant, species, have, a, large, effect, on, ecosystem, function, while, rare, species, tend, to, have, a, small, effect, keystone, species, tend, to, have, an, effect, on, ecosystem, function, that, is, disproportionate, to, their, abundance, in, an, ecosystem, 324, an, ecosystem, engineer, is, any, organism, that, creates, significantly, modifies, maintains, or, destroys, a, habitat, ecosystem, ecology, is, the, study, of, the, interactions, between, organisms, and, their, environment, as, an, integrated, system, 458, the, size, of, ecosystems, can, range, up, to, ten, orders, of, magnitude, from, the, surface, layers, of, rocks, to, the, surface, of, the, planet, 6, the, hubbard, brook, ecosystem, study, started, in, 1963, to, study, the, white, mountains, in, new, hampshire, it, was, the, first, successful, attempt, to, study, an, entire, watershed, as, an, ecosystem, the, study, used, stream, chemistry, as, a, means, of, monitoring, ecosystem, properties, and, developed, a, detailed, biogeochemical, model, of, the, ecosystem, long, term, research, at, the, site, led, to, the, discovery, of, acid, rain, in, north, america, in, 1972, researchers, documented, the, depletion, of, soil, cations, especially, calcium, over, the, next, several, decades, ecosystems, can, be, studied, through, a, variety, of, approaches, theoretical, studies, studies, monitoring, specific, ecosystems, over, long, periods, of, time, those, that, look, at, differences, between, ecosystems, to, elucidate, how, they, work, and, direct, manipulative, experimentation, studies, can, be, carried, out, at, a, variety, of, scales, ranging, from, whole, ecosystem, studies, to, studying, microcosms, or, mesocosms, simplified, representations, of, ecosystems, american, ecologist, stephen, r, carpenter, has, argued, that, microcosm, experiments, can, be, irrelevant, and, diversionary, if, they, are, not, carried, out, in, conjunction, with, field, studies, done, at, the, ecosystem, scale, in, such, cases, microcosm, experiments, may, fail, to, accurately, predict, ecosystem, level, dynamics, biomes, are, general, classes, or, categories, of, ecosystems, 14, however, there, is, no, clear, distinction, between, biomes, and, ecosystems, biomes, are, always, defined, at, a, very, general, level, ecosystems, can, be, described, at, levels, that, range, from, very, general, in, which, case, the, names, are, sometimes, the, same, as, those, of, biomes, to, very, specific, such, as, wet, coastal, needle, leafed, forests, biomes, vary, due, to, global, variations, in, climate, biomes, are, often, defined, by, their, structure, at, a, general, level, for, example, tropical, forests, temperate, grasslands, and, arctic, tundra, 14, there, can, be, any, degree, of, subcategories, among, ecosystem, types, that, comprise, a, biome, e, g, needle, leafed, boreal, forests, or, wet, tropical, forests, although, ecosystems, are, most, commonly, categorized, by, their, structure, and, geography, there, are, also, other, ways, to, categorize, and, classify, ecosystems, such, as, by, their, level, of, human, impact, see, anthropogenic, biome, or, by, their, integration, with, social, processes, or, technological, processes, or, their, novelty, e, g, novel, ecosystem, each, of, these, taxonomies, of, ecosystems, tends, to, emphasize, different, structural, or, functional, properties, none, of, these, is, the, best, classification, ecosystem, classifications, are, specific, kinds, of, ecological, classifications, that, consider, all, four, elements, of, the, definition, of, ecosystems, a, biotic, component, an, abiotic, complex, the, interactions, between, and, within, them, and, the, physical, space, they, occupy, different, approaches, to, ecological, classifications, have, been, developed, in, terrestrial, freshwater, and, marine, disciplines, and, a, function, based, typology, has, been, proposed, to, leverage, the, strengths, of, these, different, approaches, into, a, unified, system, human, activities, are, important, in, almost, all, ecosystems, although, humans, exist, and, operate, within, ecosystems, their, cumulative, effects, are, large, enough, to, influence, external, factors, like, climate, 14, ecosystems, provide, a, variety, of, goods, and, services, upon, which, people, depend, ecosystem, goods, include, the, tangible, material, products, of, ecosystem, processes, such, as, water, food, fuel, construction, material, and, medicinal, plants, they, also, include, less, tangible, items, like, tourism, and, recreation, and, genes, from, wild, plants, and, animals, that, can, be, used, to, improve, domestic, species, ecosystem, services, on, the, other, hand, are, generally, improvements, in, the, condition, or, location, of, things, of, value, these, include, things, like, the, maintenance, of, hydrological, cycles, cleaning, air, and, water, the, maintenance, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, crop, pollination, and, even, things, like, beauty, inspiration, and, opportunities, for, research, while, material, from, the, ecosystem, had, traditionally, been, recognized, as, being, the, basis, for, things, of, economic, value, ecosystem, services, tend, to, be, taken, for, granted, the, millennium, ecosystem, assessment, is, an, international, synthesis, by, over, 1000, of, the, world, s, leading, biological, scientists, that, analyzes, the, state, of, the, earth, s, ecosystems, and, provides, summaries, and, guidelines, for, decision, makers, the, report, identified, four, major, categories, of, ecosystem, services, provisioning, regulating, cultural, and, supporting, services, it, concludes, that, human, activity, is, having, a, significant, and, escalating, impact, on, the, biodiversity, of, the, world, ecosystems, reducing, both, their, resilience, and, biocapacity, the, report, refers, to, natural, systems, as, humanity, s, life, support, system, providing, essential, ecosystem, services, the, assessment, measures, 24, ecosystem, services, and, concludes, that, only, four, have, shown, improvement, over, the, last, 50, years, 15, are, in, serious, decline, and, five, are, in, a, precarious, condition, 6, 19, the, intergovernmental, science, policy, platform, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, ipbes, is, an, intergovernmental, organization, established, to, improve, the, interface, between, science, and, policy, on, issues, of, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, it, is, intended, to, serve, a, similar, role, to, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ecosystem, services, are, limited, and, also, threatened, by, human, activities, to, help, inform, decision, makers, many, ecosystem, services, are, being, assigned, economic, values, often, based, on, the, cost, of, replacement, with, anthropogenic, alternatives, the, ongoing, challenge, of, prescribing, economic, value, to, nature, for, example, through, biodiversity, banking, is, prompting, transdisciplinary, shifts, in, how, we, recognize, and, manage, the, environment, social, responsibility, business, opportunities, and, our, future, as, a, species, as, human, population, and, per, capita, consumption, grow, so, do, the, resource, demands, imposed, on, ecosystems, and, the, effects, of, the, human, ecological, footprint, natural, resources, are, vulnerable, and, limited, the, environmental, impacts, of, anthropogenic, actions, are, becoming, more, apparent, problems, for, all, ecosystems, include, environmental, pollution, climate, change, and, biodiversity, loss, for, terrestrial, ecosystems, further, threats, include, air, pollution, soil, degradation, and, deforestation, for, aquatic, ecosystems, threats, also, include, unsustainable, exploitation, of, marine, resources, for, example, overfishing, marine, pollution, microplastics, pollution, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, e, g, warming, and, acidification, and, building, on, coastal, areas, many, ecosystems, become, degraded, through, human, impacts, such, as, soil, loss, air, and, water, pollution, habitat, fragmentation, water, diversion, fire, suppression, and, introduced, species, and, invasive, species, 437, these, threats, can, lead, to, abrupt, transformation, of, the, ecosystem, or, to, gradual, disruption, of, biotic, processes, and, degradation, of, abiotic, conditions, of, the, ecosystem, once, the, original, ecosystem, has, lost, its, defining, features, it, is, considered, collapsed, see, also, iucn, red, list, of, ecosystems, ecosystem, collapse, could, be, reversible, and, in, this, way, differs, from, species, extinction, quantitative, assessments, of, the, risk, of, collapse, are, used, as, measures, of, conservation, status, and, trends, when, natural, resource, management, is, applied, to, whole, ecosystems, rather, than, single, species, it, is, termed, ecosystem, management, although, definitions, of, ecosystem, management, abound, there, is, a, common, set, of, principles, which, underlie, these, definitions, a, fundamental, principle, is, the, long, term, sustainability, of, the, production, of, goods, and, services, by, the, ecosystem, intergenerational, sustainability, a, precondition, for, management, not, an, afterthought, while, ecosystem, management, can, be, used, as, part, of, a, plan, for, wilderness, conservation, it, can, also, be, used, in, intensively, managed, ecosystems, see, for, example, agroecosystem, and, close, to, nature, forestry, integrated, conservation, and, development, projects, icdps, aim, to, address, conservation, and, human, livelihood, sustainable, development, concerns, in, developing, countries, together, rather, than, separately, as, was, often, done, in, the, past, 445, the, following, articles, are, types, of, ecosystems, for, particular, types, of, regions, or, zones, ecosystem, instances, in, specific, regions, of, the, world
