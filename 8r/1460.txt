people, types, of, behaviors, or, certain, situations, that, have, been, known, to, cause, a, panic, attack, this, being, said, not, all, attacks, can, be, prevented, in, addition, to, recurrent, and, unexpected, panic, attacks, a, diagnosis, of, panic, disorder, requires, that, said, attacks, have, chronic, consequences, either, worry, over, the, attacks, potential, implications, persistent, fear, of, future, attacks, or, significant, changes, in, behavior, related, to, the, attacks, as, such, those, with, panic, disorder, experience, symptoms, even, outside, of, specific, panic, episodes, often, normal, changes, in, heartbeat, are, noticed, leading, them, to, think, something, is, wrong, with, their, heart, or, they, are, about, to, have, another, panic, attack, in, some, cases, a, heightened, awareness, hypervigilance, of, body, functioning, occurs, during, panic, attacks, wherein, any, perceived, physiological, change, is, interpreted, as, a, possible, life, threatening,

affects, roughly, 7, of, adults, and, 4, of, children, but, childhood, cases, tend, to, be, more, severe, in, some, instances, even, a, brief, separation, can, produce, panic, treating, a, child, earlier, may, prevent, problems, this, may, include, training, the, parents, and, family, on, how, to, deal, with, it, often, the, parents, will, reinforce, the, anxiety, because, they, do, not, know, how, to, properly, work, through, it, with, the, child, in, addition, to, parent, training, and, family, therapy, medication, such, as, ssris, can, be, used, to, treat, separation, anxiety, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, is, not, an, anxiety, disorder, in, the, dsm, 5, or, the, icd, 11, however, it, was, classified, as, such, in, older, versions, of, the, dsm, iv, and, icd, 10, ocd, manifests, in, the, form, of, obsessions, distressing, persistent, and, intrusive, thoughts, or, images, and, compulsions, urges, to, repeatedly, perform, specific, acts, or, rituals, that, are, not, caused, by, drugs, or, physical, disorders, and, which, cause, anxiety, or, distress, plus, more, or, less, important, functional, disabilities, ocd, affects, roughly, 1, 2, of, adults, somewhat, more, women, than, men, and, under, 3, of, children, and, adolescents, a, person, with, ocd, knows, that, the, symptoms, are, unreasonable, and, struggles, against, both, the, thoughts, and, the, behavior, their, symptoms, could, be, related, to, external, events, they, fear, such, as, their, home, burning, down, because, they, forgot, to, turn, off, the, stove, or, they, could, worry, that, they, will, behave, inappropriately, the, compulsive, rituals, are, personal, rules, they, follow, to, relieve, discomfort, such, as, needing, to, verify, that, the, stove, is, turned, off, a, specific, number, of, times, before, leaving, the, house, it, is, not, certain, why, some, people, have, ocd, but, behavioral, cognitive, genetic, and, neurobiological, factors, may, be, involved, risk, factors, include, family, history, being, single, being, of, a, higher, socioeconomic, class, or, not, being, in, paid, employment, of, those, with, ocd, about, 20, of, people, will, overcome, it, and, symptoms, will, at, least, reduce, over, time, for, most, people, a, further, 50, selective, mutism, sm, is, a, disorder, in, which, a, person, who, is, normally, capable, of, speech, does, not, speak, in, specific, situations, or, to, specific, people, selective, mutism, usually, co, exists, with, shyness, or, social, anxiety, people, with, selective, mutism, stay, silent, even, when,

selective, mutism, is, important, because, doctors, must, determine, if, it, is, an, issue, associated, with, the, child, s, hearing, or, movements, associated, with, the, jaw, or, tongue, and, if, the, child, can, understand, when, others, are, speaking, to, them, generally, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, is, the, recommended, approach, for, treating, selective, mutism, but, prospective, long, term, outcome, studies, are, lacking, the, diagnosis, of, anxiety, disorders, is, made, by, symptoms, triggers, and, a, person, s, personal, and, family, histories, there, are, no, objective, biomarkers, or, laboratory, tests, that, can, diagnose, anxiety, it, is, important, for, a, medical, professional, to, evaluate, a, person, for, other, medical, and, mental, causes, of, prolonged, anxiety, because, treatments, will, vary, considerably, numerous, questionnaires, have, been, developed, for, clinical, use, and, can, be, used, for, an, objective, scoring, system, symptoms, may, vary, between, each, sub, type, of, generalized, anxiety, disorder, generally, symptoms, must, be, present, for, at, least, six, months, occur, more, days, than, not, and, significantly, impair, a, person, s, ability, to, function, in, daily, life, symptoms, may, include, feeling, nervous, anxious, or, on, edge, worrying, excessively, difficulty, concentrating, restlessness, and, irritability,

appropriate, periods, they, differ, from, transient, fear, or, anxiety, often, stress, induced, by, being, persistent, e, g, typically, lasting, 6, months, or, more, although, the, criterion, for, duration, is, intended, as, a, general, guide, with, allowance, for, some, degree, of, flexibility, and, is, sometimes, of, shorter, duration, in, children, the, diagnosis, of, an, anxiety, disorder, requires, first, ruling, out, an, underlying, medical, cause, diseases, that, may, present, similar, to, an, anxiety, disorder, include, certain, endocrine, diseases, hypo, and, hyperthyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, metabolic, disorders, diabetes, deficiency, states, low, levels, of, vitamin, d, b2, b12, folic, acid, gastrointestinal, diseases, celiac, disease, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, inflammatory, bowel, disease, heart, diseases, blood, diseases, anemia, and, brain, degenerative, diseases, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, multiple, sclerosis, huntington, s, disease, several, drugs, can, also, cause, or, worsen, anxiety, whether, through, intoxication, withdrawal, or, chronic, use, these, include, alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, sedatives, including, prescription, benzodiazepines, opioids, including, prescription, painkillers, and, illicit, drugs, like, heroin, stimulants, such, as, caffeine, cocaine, and, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and, inhalants, focus, is, increasing, on, the, prevention, of, anxiety, disorders, there, is, tentative, evidence, to, support, the, use, of, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, and, mindfulness, therapy, a, 2013, review, found, no, effective, measures, to, prevent, gad, in, adults, a, 2017, review, found, that, psychological, and, educational, interventions, had, a, small, benefit, for, the, prevention, of, anxiety, research, indicates, that, predictors, of, the, emergence, of, anxiety, disorders, partly, differ, from, the, factors, that, predict, their, persistence, people, with, an, anxiety, disorder, may, be, challenged, by, prejudices, and, stereotypes, held, by, other, people, most, likely, as, a, result, of, misconceptions, around, anxiety, and, anxiety, disorders, misconceptions, found, in, a, data, analysis, from, the, national, survey, of, mental, health, literacy, and, stigma, include, 1, many, people, believe, anxiety, is, not, a, real, medical, illness, and, 2, many, people, believe, that, people, with, anxiety, could, turn, it, off, if, they, wanted, to, for, people, experiencing, the, physical, and, mental, symptoms, of, an, anxiety, disorder, stigma, and, negative, social, perception, can, make, an, individual, less, likely, to, seek, treatment, prejudice, that, some, people, with, mental, illness, turn, against, themselves, is, called, self, stigma, there, is, no, explicit, evidence, for, the, exact, cause, of, stigma, towards, anxiety, stigma, can, be, divided, by, social, scale, into, the, macro, intermediate, and, micro, levels, the, macro, level, marks, society, as, a, whole, with, the, influence, of, mass, media, the, intermediate, level, includes, healthcare, professionals, and, their, perspectives, the, micro, level, details, the, individual, s, contributions, to, the, process, through, self, stigmatization, stigma, can, be, described, in, three, conceptual, ways, cognitive, emotional, and, behavioral, this, allows, for, differentiation, between, stereotypes, prejudice, and, discrimination, treatment, options, include, therapies, medications, and, lifestyle, changes, there, is, no, clear, evidence, as, to, whether, therapy, or, medication, is, most, effective, the, specific, medication, decision, can, be, made, by, a, doctor, and, patient, with, consideration, for, the, patient, s, specific, circumstances, and, symptoms, if, while, on, treatment, with, a, chosen, medication, the, person, s, anxiety, does, not, improve, another, medication, may, be, offered, specific, treatments, will, vary, by, sub, type, of, anxiety, disorder, a, person, s, other, medical, conditions, and, medications, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, is, effective, for, anxiety, disorders, and, is, a, first, line, treatment, cbt, appears, to, be, equally, effective, when, carried, out, via, the, internet, compared, to, sessions, completed, face, to, face, exposure, and, response, prevention, erp, has, been, found, effective, for, treating, ptsd, phobias, ocd, and, gad, mindfulness, based, programs, also, appear, to, be, effective, for, managing, anxiety, disorders, it, is, unclear, if, meditation, has, an, effect, on, anxiety, and, transcendental, meditation, appears, to, be, no, different, from, other, types, of, meditation, a, 2015, cochrane, review, of, morita, therapy, for, anxiety, disorder, in, adults, found, not, enough, evidence, to, draw, a, conclusion, adventure, based, counseling, can, be, an, effective, way, to, treat, anxiety, using, rock, climbing, as, an, example, climbing, can, often, bring, on, fear, or, frustration, and, tackling, these, negative, feelings, in, a, nurturing, environment, can, help, people, develop, the, coping, mechanisms, necessary, to, deal, with, these, negative, feelings, first, line, choices, for, medications, include, ssris, or, snris, to, treat, generalized, anxiety, disorder, for, adults, there, is, no, good, evidence, supporting, which, specific, medication, in, the, ssri, or, snri, class, is, best, for, treating, anxiety, so, cost, often, drives, drug, choice, fluvoxamine, is, effective, in, treating, a, range, of, anxiety, disorders, in, children, and, adolescents, fluoxetine, sertraline, and, paroxetine, can, also, help, with, some, forms, of, anxiety, in, children, and, adolescents, if, the, chosen, medicine, is, effective, it, is, recommended, that, it, be, continued, for, at, least, a, year, stopping, medication, results, in, a, greater, risk, of, relapse, buspirone, and, pregabalin, are, second, line, treatments, for, people, who, do, not, respond, to, ssris, or, snris, pregabalin, and, gabapentin, are, effective, in, treating, some, anxiety, disorders, but, there, is, concern, regarding, their, off, label, use, due, to, the, lack, of, strong, scientific, evidence, for, their, efficacy, in, multiple, conditions, and, their, proven, side, effects, medications, need, to, be, used, with, care, among, older, adults, who, are, more, likely, to, have, side, effects, because, of, coexisting, physical, disorders, adherence, problems, are, more, likely, among, older, people, who, may, have, difficulty, understanding, seeing, or, remembering, instructions, in, general, medications, are, not, seen, as, helpful, for, specific, phobias, but, benzodiazepines, are, sometimes, used, to, help, resolve, acute, episodes, in, 2007, data, were, sparse, for, the, efficacy, of, any, drug, lifestyle, changes, include, exercise, for, which, there, is, moderate, evidence, for, some, improvement, regularizing, sleep, patterns, reducing, caffeine, intake, and, stopping, smoking, stopping, smoking, has, benefits, for, anxiety, as, great, as, or, greater, than, those, of, medications, a, meta, analysis, found, 2000, mg, day, or, more, of, omega, 3, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, such, as, fish, oil, tended, to, reduce, anxiety, in, placebo, controlled, and, uncontrolled, studies, particularly, in, people, with, more, significant, symptoms, as, of, 2019, there, is, little, evidence, for, the, use, of, cannabis, in, treating, anxiety, disorders, both, therapy, and, a, number, of, medications, have, been, found, to, be, useful, for, treating, childhood, anxiety, disorders, therapy, is, generally, preferred, to, medication, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, is, a, good, first, line, therapy, approach, studies, have, gathered, substantial, evidence, for, treatments, that, are, not, cbt, based, as, effective, forms, of, treatment, expanding, treatment, options, for, those, who, do, not, respond, to, cbt, although, studies, have, demonstrated, the, effectiveness, of, cbt, for, anxiety, disorders, in, children, and, adolescents, evidence, that, it, is, more, effective, than, treatment, as, usual, medication, or, wait, list, controls, is, inconclusive, like, adults, children, may, undergo, psychotherapy, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, or, counseling, family, therapy, is, a, form, of, treatment, in, which, the, child, meets, with, a, therapist, together, with, the, primary, guardians, and, siblings, each, family, member, may, attend, individual, therapy, but, family, therapy, is, typically, a, form, of, group, therapy, art, and, play, therapy, are, also, used, art, therapy, is, most, commonly, used, when, the, child, will, not, or, cannot, verbally, communicate, due, to, trauma, or, a, disability, in, which, they, are, nonverbal, participating, in, art, activities, allows, the, child, to, express, what, they, otherwise, may, not, be, able, to, communicate, to, others, in, play, therapy, the, child, is, allowed, to, play, however, they, please, as, a, therapist, observes, them, the, therapist, may, intercede, from, time, to, time, with, a, question, comment, or, suggestion, this, is, often, most, effective, when, the, family, of, the, child, plays, a, role, in, the, treatment, if, a, medication, option, is, warranted, antidepressants, such, as, ssris, and, snris, can, be, effective, fluvoxamine, is, effective, in, treating, a, range, of, anxiety, disorders, in, children, and, adolescents, minor, side, effects, with, medications, however, are, common, globally, as, of, 2010, approximately, 273, million, 4, 5, of, the, population, had, an, anxiety, disorder, it, is, more, common, in, females, 5, 2, than, males, 2, 8, in, europe, africa, and, asia, lifetime, rates, of, anxiety, disorders, are, between, 9, and, 16, and, yearly, rates, are, between, 4, and, 7, in, the, united, states, the, lifetime, prevalence, of, anxiety, disorders, is, about, 29, and, between, 11, and, 18, of, adults, have, the, condition, in, a, given, year, this, difference, is, affected, by, the, range, of, ways, in, which, different, cultures, interpret, anxiety, symptoms, and, what, they, consider, to, be, normative, behavior, in, general, anxiety, disorders, represent, the, most, prevalent, psychiatric, condition, in, the, united, states, outside, of, substance, use, disorder, like, adults, children, can, experience, anxiety, disorders, between, 10, and, 20, percent, of, all, children, will, develop, a, full, fledged, anxiety, disorder, prior, to, the, age, of, 18, making, anxiety, the, most, common, mental, health, issue, in, young, people, anxiety, disorders, in, children, are, often, more, challenging, to, identify, than, their, adult, counterparts, owing, to, the, difficulty, many, parents, face, in, discerning, them, from, normal, childhood, fears, likewise, anxiety, in, children, is, sometimes, misdiagnosed, as, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, or, due, to, the, tendency, of, children, to, interpret, their, emotions, physically, as, stomachaches, headaches, etc, anxiety, disorders, may, initially, be,
