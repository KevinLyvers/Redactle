saffron, s, f, r, n, r, n, is, a, spice, derived, from, the, flower, of, crocus, sativus, commonly, known, as, the, saffron, crocus, the, vivid, crimson, stigma, and, styles, called, threads, are, collected, and, dried, for, use, mainly, as, a, seasoning, and, colouring, agent, in, food, the, saffron, crocus, was, slowly, propagated, throughout, much, of, eurasia, and, was, later, brought, to, parts, of, north, africa, north, america, and, oceania, saffron, s, taste, and, iodoform, like, or, hay, like, fragrance, result, from, the, phytochemicals, picrocrocin, and, safranal, it, also, contains, a, carotenoid, pigment, crocin, which, imparts, a, rich, golden, yellow, hue, to, dishes, and, textiles, its, recorded, history, is, attested, in, a, 7th, century, bc, assyrian, botanical, treatise, and, it, has, been, traded, and, used, for, thousands, of, years, as, of, 2018, iran, produced, some, 88, of, the, world, total, for, saffron, at, us, 5, 000, per, kg, or, higher, saffron, has, long, been, the, world, s, costliest, spice, by, weight, a, degree, of, uncertainty, surrounds, the, origin, of, the, english, word, saffron, it, might, stem, from, the, 12th, century, old, french, term, safran, which, comes, from, the, latin, word, safranum, from, the, persian, za, far, n, from, the, persian, word, zarpar, n, meaning, gold, strung, implying, either, the, golden, stamens, of, the, flower, or, the, golden, colour, it, creates, when, used, as, flavour, the, domesticated, saffron, crocus, crocus, sativus, is, an, autumn, flowering, perennial, plant, unknown, in, the, wild, it, probably, descends, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, autumn, flowering, crocus, cartwrightianus, which, is, also, known, as, wild, saffron, and, is, native, to, mainland, greece, euboea, crete, skyros, and, some, islands, of, the, cyclades, the, similar, species, c, thomasii, and, c, pallasii, were, considered, as, other, possible, ancestors, as, a, genetically, monomorphic, clone, incapable, of, seed, production, it, was, slowly, propagated, by, humans, throughout, much, of, eurasia, before, this, recent, research, various, origins, had, been, suggested, for, saffron, including, iran, greece, mesopotamia, and, kashmir, it, is, a, sterile, triploid, form, which, means, that, three, homologous, sets, of, chromosomes, make, up, each, specimen, s, genetic, complement, c, sativus, bears, eight, chromosomal, bodies, per, set, making, for, 24, in, total, being, sterile, the, purple, flowers, of, c, sativus, fail, to, produce, viable, seeds, reproduction, hinges, on, human, assistance, clusters, of, corms, underground, bulb, like, starch, storing, organs, must, be, dug, up, divided, and, replanted, a, corm, survives, for, one, season, producing, via, vegetative, division, up, to, ten, cormlets, that, can, grow, into, new, plants, in, the, next, season, the, compact, corms, are, small, brown, globules, that, can, measure, as, large, as, 5, cm, 2, in, in, diameter, have, a, flat, base, and, are, shrouded, in, a, dense, mat, of, parallel, fibres, this, coat, is, referred, to, as, the, corm, tunic, corms, also, bear, vertical, fibres, thin, and, net, like, that, grow, up, to, 5, cm, 2, in, above, the, plant, s, neck, the, plant, sprouts, 5, 11, white, and, non, photosynthetic, leaves, known, as, cataphylls, these, membrane, like, structures, cover, and, protect, 5, to, 11, true, leaves, as, they, bud, and, develop, on, the, crocus, flower, the, latter, are, thin, straight, and, blade, like, green, foliage, leaves, which, are, 1, 3, mm, 1, 32, 1, 8, in, in, diameter, which, either, expand, after, the, flowers, have, opened, hysteranthous, or, do, so, simultaneously, with, their, blooming, synanthous, c, sativus, cataphylls, are, suspected, by, some, to, manifest, prior, to, blooming, when, the, plant, is, irrigated, relatively, early, in, the, growing, season, its, floral, axes, or, flower, bearing, structures, bear, bracteoles, or, specialised, leaves, that, sprout, from, the, flower, stems, the, latter, are, known, as, pedicels, after, aestivating, in, spring, the, plant, sends, up, its, true, leaves, each, up, to, 40, cm, 16, in, in, length, only, in, october, after, most, other, flowering, plants, have, released, their, seeds, do, its, brilliantly, hued, flowers, develop, they, range, from, a, light, pastel, shade, of, lilac, to, a, darker, and, more, striated, mauve, the, flowers, possess, a, sweet, honey, like, fragrance, upon, flowering, the, plants, are, 20, 30, cm, 8, 12, in, in, height, and, bear, up, to, four, flowers, a, three, pronged, style, 25, 30, mm, 1, 1, 3, 16, in, in, length, emerges, from, each, flower, each, prong, terminates, with, a, vivid, crimson, stigma, which, is, the, distal, end, of, a, carpel, the, saffron, crocus, unknown, in, the, wild, probably, descends, from, crocus, cartwrightianus, it, is, a, triploid, that, is, self, incompatible, and, male, sterile, it, undergoes, aberrant, meiosis, and, is, hence, incapable, of, independent, sexual, reproduction, all, propagation, is, by, vegetative, multiplication, via, manual, divide, and, set, of, a, starter, clone, or, by, interspecific, hybridisation, crocus, sativus, thrives, in, the, mediterranean, maquis, an, ecotype, superficially, resembling, the, north, american, chaparral, and, similar, climates, where, hot, and, dry, summer, breezes, sweep, semi, arid, lands, it, can, nonetheless, survive, cold, winters, tolerating, frosts, as, low, as, 10, c, 14, f, and, short, periods, of, snow, cover, some, reports, suggest, saffron, can, tolerate, an, air, temperature, range, from, 22, to, 40, c, irrigation, is, required, if, grown, outside, of, moist, environments, such, as, kashmir, where, annual, rainfall, averages, 1, 000, 1, 500, mm, 40, 60, in, saffron, growing, regions, in, greece, 500, mm, or, 20, in, annually, and, spain, 400, mm, or, 16, in, are, far, drier, than, the, main,

window, of, one, or, two, weeks, stigmas, are, dried, quickly, upon, extraction, and, preferably, sealed, in, airtight, containers, the, high, retail, value, of, saffron, is, maintained, on, world, markets, because, of, labour, intensive, harvesting, methods, which, require, some, 440, 000, hand, picked, saffron, stigmas, per, kilogram, 200, 000, stigmas, lb, equivalently, 150, 000, crocus, flowers, per, kilogram, 70, 000, flowers, lb, forty, hours, of, labour, are, needed, to, pick, 150, 000, flowers, one, freshly, picked, crocus, flower, yields, on, average, 30, mg, of, fresh, saffron, or, 7, mg, dried, roughly, 150, flowers, yield, 1, g, 1, 32, oz, of, dry, saffron, threads, to, produce, 12, g, 7, 16, oz, of, dried, saffron, 450, g, 1, lb, of, flowers, are, needed, the, yield, of, dried, spice, from, fresh, saffron, is, only, 13, g, kg, 0, 2, oz, lb, saffron, contains, some, 28, volatile, and, aroma, yielding, compounds, dominated, by, ketones, and, aldehydes, its, main, aroma, active, compounds, are, safranal, the, main, compound, responsible, for, saffron, aroma, 4, ketoisophorone, and, dihydrooxophorone, saffron, also, contains, nonvolatile, phytochemicals, including, the, carotenoids, zeaxanthin, lycopene, various, and, carotenes, as, well, as, crocetin, and, its, glycoside, crocein, which, are, the, most, biologically, active, components, because, crocetin, is, smaller, and, more, water, soluble, than, the, other, carotenoids, it, is, more, rapidly, absorbed, the, yellow, orange, colour, of, saffron, is, primarily, the, result, of, crocin, this, crocin, is, trans, crocetin, di, d, gentiobiosyl, ester, it, bears, the, systematic, iupac, name, 8, 8, diapo, 8, 8, carotenoic, acid, this, means, that, the, crocin, underlying, saffron, s, aroma, is, a, digentiobiose, ester, of, the, carotenoid, crocetin, crocins, themselves, are, a, series, of, hydrophilic, carotenoids, that, are, either, monoglycosyl, or, diglycosyl, polyene, esters, of, crocetin, crocetin, is, a, conjugated, polyene, dicarboxylic, acid, that, is, hydrophobic, and, thus, oil, soluble, when, crocetin, is, esterified, with, two, water, soluble, gentiobioses, which, are, sugars, a, product, results, that, is, itself, water, soluble, the, resultant, crocin, is, a, carotenoid, pigment, that, may, make, up, more, than, 10, of, dry, saffron, s, mass, the, two, esterified, gentiobioses, make, crocin, ideal, for, colouring, water, based, and, non, fatty, foods, such, as, rice, dishes, the, bitter, glucoside, picrocrocin, is, responsible, for, saffron, s, pungent, flavour, picrocrocin, chemical, formula, c, 16, h, 26, o, 7, systematic, name, 4, d, glucopyranosyloxy, 2, 6, 6, trimethylcyclohex, 1, ene, 1, carbaldehyde, is, a, union, of, an, aldehyde, sub, molecule, known, as, safranal, systematic, name, 2, 6, 6, trimethylcyclohexa, 1, 3, diene, 1, carbaldehyde, and, a, carbohydrate, it, has, insecticidal, and, pesticidal, properties, and, may, comprise, up, to, 4, of, dry, saffron, picrocrocin, is, a, truncated, version, of, the, carotenoid, zeaxanthin, that, is, produced, via, oxidative, cleavage, and, is, the, glycoside, of, the, terpene, aldehyde, safranal, when, saffron, is, dried, after, its, harvest, the, heat, combined, with, enzymatic, action, splits, picrocrocin, to, yield, d, glucose, and, a, free, safranal, molecule, safranal, a, volatile, oil, gives, saffron, much, of, its, distinctive, aroma, safranal, is, less, bitter, than, picrocrocin, and, may, comprise, up, to, 70, of, dry, saffron, s, volatile, fraction, in, some, samples, a, second, molecule, underlying, saffron, s, aroma, is, 2, hydroxy, 4, 4, 6, trimethyl, 2, 5, cyclohexadien, 1, one, which, produces, a, scent, described, as, saffron, dried, hay, like, chemists, find, this, is, the, most, powerful, contributor, to, saffron, s, fragrance, despite, its, presence, in, a, lesser, quantity, than, safranal, dry, saffron, is, highly, sensitive, to, fluctuating, ph, levels, and, rapidly, breaks, down, chemically, in, the, presence, of, light, and, oxidising, agents, it, must, therefore, be, stored, away, in, air, tight, containers, to, minimise, contact, with, atmospheric, oxygen, saffron, is, somewhat, more, resistant, to, heat, saffron, is, not, all, of, the, same, quality, and, strength, strength, is, related, to, several, factors, including, the, amount, of, style, picked, along, with, the, red, stigma, age, of, the, saffron, is, also, a, factor, more, style, included, means, the, saffron, is, less, strong, gram, for, gram, because, the, colour, and, flavour, are, concentrated, in, the, red, stigmas, saffron, from, iran, spain, and, kashmir, is, classified, into, various, grades, according, to, the, relative, amounts, of, red, stigma, and, yellow, styles, it, contains, grades, of, iranian, saffron, are, sargol, persian, red, stigma, tips, only, strongest, grade, pushal, or, pushali, red, stigmas, plus, some, yellow, style, lower, strength, bunch, saffron, red, stigmas, plus, large, amount, of, yellow, style, presented, in, a, tiny, bundle, like, a, miniature, wheatsheaf, and, konge, yellow, style, only, claimed, to, have, aroma, but, with, very, little, if, any, colouring, potential, grades, of, spanish, saffron, are, coup, the, strongest, grade, like, iranian, sargol, mancha, like, iranian, pushal, and, in, order, of, further, decreasing, strength, rio, standard, and, sierra, saffron, the, word, mancha, in, the, spanish, classification, can, have, two, meanings, a, general, grade, of, saffron, or, a, very, high, quality, spanish, grown, saffron, from, a, specific, geographical, origin, real, spanish, grown, la, mancha, saffron, has, pdo, protected, status, and, this, is, displayed, on, the, product, packaging, spanish, growers, fought, hard, for, protected, status, because, they, felt, that, imports, of, iranian, saffron, re, packaged, in, spain, and, sold, as, spanish, mancha, saffron, were, undermining, the, genuine, la, mancha, brand, similar, was, the, case, in, kashmir, where, imported, iranian, saffron, is, mixed, with, local, saffron, and, sold, as, kashmir, brand, at, a, higher, price, in, kashmir, saffron, is, mostly, classified, into, two, main, categories, called, mongra, stigma, alone, and, lachha, stigmas, attached, with, parts, of, the, style, countries, producing, less, saffron, do, not, have, specialised, words, for, different, grades, and, may, only, produce, one, grade, artisan, producers, in, europe, and, new, zealand, have, offset, their, higher, labour, charges, for, saffron, harvesting, by, targeting, quality, only, offering, extremely, high, grade, saffron, in, addition, to, descriptions, based, on, how, the, saffron, is, picked, saffron, may, be, categorised, under, the, international, standard, iso, 3632, after, laboratory, measurement, of, crocin, responsible, for, saffron, s, colour, picrocrocin, taste, and, safranal, fragrance, or, aroma, content, however, often, there, is, no, clear, grading, information, on, the, product, packaging, and, little, of, the, saffron, readily, available, in, the, uk, is, labelled, with, iso, category, this, lack, of, information, makes, it, hard, for, customers, to, make, informed, choices, when, comparing, prices, and, buying, saffron, under, iso, 3632, determination, of, non, stigma, content, floral, waste, content, and, other, extraneous, matter, such, as, inorganic, material, ash, are, also, key, grading, standards, are, set, by, the, international, organization, for, standardization, a, federation, of, national, standards, bodies, iso, 3632, deals, exclusively, with, saffron, and, establishes, three, categories, iii, poorest, quality, ii, and, i, finest, quality, formerly, there, was, also, category, iv, which, was, below, category, iii, samples, are, assigned, categories, by, gauging, the, spice, s, crocin, and, picrocrocin, content, revealed, by, measurements, of, specific, spectrophotometric, absorbance, safranal, is, treated, slightly, differently, and, rather, than, there, being, threshold, levels, for, each, category, samples, must, give, a, reading, of, 20, 50, for, all, categories, these, data, are, measured, through, spectrophotometry, reports, at, certified, testing, laboratories, worldwide, higher, absorbances, imply, greater, levels, of, crocin, picrocrocin, and, safranal, and, thus, a, greater, colouring, potential, and, therefore, strength, per, gram, the, absorbance, reading, of, crocin, is, known, as, the, colouring, strength, of, that, saffron, saffron, s, colouring, strength, can, range, from, lower, than, 80, for, all, category, iv, saffron, up, to, 200, or, greater, for, category, i, the, world, s, finest, samples, the, selected, most, red, maroon, tips, of, stigmas, picked, from, the, finest, flowers, receive, colouring, strengths, in, excess, of, 250, making, such, saffron, over, three, times, more, powerful, than, category, iv, saffron, market, prices, for, saffron, types, follow, directly, from, these, iso, categories, sargol, and, coup, saffron, would, typically, fall, into, iso, 3632, category, i, pushal, and, mancha, would, probably, be, assigned, to, category, ii, on, many, saffron, packaging, labels, neither, the, iso, 3632, category, nor, the, colouring, strength, the, measurement, of, crocin, content, is, displayed, however, many, growers, traders, and, consumers, reject, such, lab, test, numbers, some, people, prefer, a, more, holistic, method, of, sampling, batches, of, threads, for, taste, aroma, pliability, and, other, traits, in, a, fashion, similar, to, that, practised, by, experienced, wine, tasters, despite, attempts, at, quality, control, and, standardisation, an, extensive, history, of, saffron, adulteration, particularly, among, the, cheapest, grades, continues, into, modern, times, adulteration, was, first, documented, in, europe, s, middle, ages, when, those, found, selling, adulterated, saffron, were, executed, under, the, safranschou, code, typical, methods, include, mixing, in, extraneous, substances, like, beetroot, pomegranate, fibres, red, dyed, silk, fibres, or, the, saffron, crocus, s, tasteless, and, odourless, yellow, stamens, other, methods, included, dousing, saffron, fibres, with, viscid, substances, like, honey, or, vegetable, oil, to, increase, their, weight, powdered, saffron, is, more, prone, to, adulteration, with, turmeric, paprika, and, other, powders, used, as, diluting, fillers, adulteration, can, also, consist, of, selling, mislabelled, mixes, of, different, saffron, grades, thus, high, grade, kashmiri, saffron, is, often, sold, and, mixed, with, cheaper, iranian, imports, these, mixes, are, then, marketed, as, pure, kashmiri, saffron, a, development, that, has, cost, kashmiri, growers, much, of, their, income, safflower, is, a, common, substitute, sometimes, sold, as, saffron, the, spice, is, reportedly, counterfeited, with, horse, hair, corn, silk, or, shredded, paper, tartrazine, or, sunset, yellow, have, been, used, to, colour, counterfeit, powdered, saffron, in, recent, years, saffron, adulterated, with, the, colouring, extract, of, gardenia, fruits, has, been, detected, in, the, european, market, this, form, of, fraud, is, difficult, to, detect, due, to, the, presence, of, flavonoids, and, crocines, in, the, gardenia, extracts, similar, to, those, naturally, occurring, in, saffron, detection, methods, have, been, developed, by, using, hplc, and, mass, spectrometry, to, determine, the, presence, of, geniposide, a, compound, present, in, the, fruits, of, gardenia, but, not, in, saffron, the, various, saffron, crocus, cultivars, give, rise, to, thread, types, that, are, often, regionally, distributed, and, characteristically, distinct, varieties, not, varieties, in, the, botanical, sense, from, spain, including, the, tradenames, spanish, superior, and, creme, are, generally, mellower, in, colour, flavour, and, aroma, they, are, graded, by, government, imposed, standards, italian, varieties, are, slightly, more, potent, than, spanish, greek, saffron, produced, in, the, town, of, krokos, is, pdo, protected, due, to, its, particularly, high, quality, colour, and, strong, flavour, various, boutique, crops, are, available, from, new, zealand, france, switzerland, england, the, united, states, and, other, countries, some, of, them, organically, grown, in, the, us, pennsylvania, dutch, saffron, known, for, its, earthy, notes, is, marketed, in, small, quantities, consumers, may, regard, certain, cultivars, as, premium, quality, the, aquila, saffron, or, zafferano, dell, aquila, is, defined, by, high, safranal, and, crocin, content, distinctive, thread, shape, unusually, pungent, aroma, and, intense, colour, it, is, grown, exclusively, on, eight, hectares, in, the, navelli, valley, of, italy, s, abruzzo, region, near, l, aquila, it, was, first, introduced, to, italy, by, a, dominican, friar, from, inquisition, era, spain, but, the, biggest, saffron, cultivation, in, italy, is, in, san, gavino, monreale, sardinia, where, it, is, grown, on, 40, hectares, representing, 60, of, italian, production, it, too, has, unusually, high, crocin, picrocrocin, and, safranal, content, another, is, the, mongra, or, lacha, saffron, of, kashmir, crocus, sativus, cashmirianus, which, is, among, the, most, difficult, for, consumers, to, obtain, repeated, droughts, blights, and, crop, failures, in, kashmir, combined, with,
