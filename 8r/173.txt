biological, pigments, also, known, simply, as, pigments, or, biochromes, are, substances, produced, by, living, organisms, that, have, a, color, resulting, from, selective, color, absorption, biological, pigments, include, plant, pigments, and, flower, pigments, many, biological, structures, such, as, skin, eyes, feathers, fur, and, hair, contain, pigments, such, as, melanin, in, specialized, cells, called, chromatophores, in, some, species, pigments, accrue, over, very, long, periods, during, an, individual, s, lifespan, pigment, color, differs, from, structural, color, in, that, it, is, the, same, for, all, viewing, angles, whereas, structural, color, is, the, result, of, selective, reflection, or, iridescence, usually, because, of, multilayer, structures, for, example, butterfly, wings, typically, contain, structural, color, although, many, butterflies, have, cells, that, contain, pigment, as, well, see, conjugated, systems, for, electron, bond, chemistry, that, causes, these, molecules, to, have, pigment, the, primary, function, of, pigments, in, plants, is, photosynthesis, which, uses, the, green, pigment, chlorophyll, and, several, colorful, pigments, that, absorb, as, much, light, energy, as, possible, pigments, are, also, known, to, play, a, role, in, pollination, where, pigment, accumulation, or, loss, can, lead, to, floral, color, change, signaling, to, pollinators, which, flowers, are, rewarding, and, contain, more, pollen, and, nectar, plant, pigments, include, many, molecules, such, as, porphyrins, carotenoids, anthocyanins, and, betalains, all, biological, pigments, selectively, absorb, certain, wavelengths, of, light, while, reflecting, others, the, principal, pigments, responsible, are, plants, in, general, contain, six, ubiquitous, carotenoids, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, and, carotene, lutein, is, a, yellow, pigment, found, in, fruits, and, vegetables, and, is, the, most, abundant, carotenoid, in, plants, lycopene, is, the, red, pigment, responsible, for, the, color, of, tomatoes, other, less, common, carotenoids, in, plants, include, lutein, epoxide, in, many, woody, species, lactucaxanthin, found, in, lettuce, and, alpha, carotene, found, in, carrots, a, particularly, noticeable, manifestation, of, pigmentation, in, plants, is, seen, with, autumn, leaf, color, a, phenomenon, that, affects, the, normally, green, leaves, of, many, deciduous, trees, and, shrubs, whereby, they, take, on, during, a, few, weeks, in, the, autumn, season, various, shades, of, red, yellow, purple, and, brown, chlorophylls, degrade, into, colorless, tetrapyrroles, known, as, nonfluorescent, chlorophyll, catabolites, nccs, as, the, predominant, chlorophylls, degrade, the, hidden, pigments, of, yellow, xanthophylls, and, orange, beta, carotene, are, revealed, these, pigments, are, present, throughout, the, year, but, the, red, pigments, the, anthocyanins, are, synthesized, de, novo, once, roughly, half, of, chlorophyll, has, been, degraded, the, amino, acids, released, from, degradation, of, light, harvesting, complexes, are, stored, all, winter, in, the, tree, s, roots, branches, stems, and, trunk, until, next, spring, when, they, are, recycled, to, re, leaf, the, tree, algae, are, very, diverse, photosynthetic, organisms, which, differ, from, plants, in, that, they, are, aquatic, organisms, they, do, not, present, vascular, tissue, and, do, not, generate, an, embryo, however, both, types, of, organisms, share, the, possession, of, photosynthetic, pigments, which, absorb, and, release, energy, that, is, later, used, by, the, cell, these, pigments, in, addition, to, chlorophylls, are, phycobiliproteins, fucoxanthins, xanthophylls, and, carotenes, which, serve, to, trap, the, energy, of, light, and, lead, it, to, the, primary, pigment, which, is, responsible, for, initiating, oxygenic, photosynthesis, reactions, algal, phototrophs, such, as, dinoflagellates, use, peridinin, as, a, light, harvesting, pigment, while, carotenoids, can, be, found, complexed, within, chlorophyll, binding, proteins, such, as, the, photosynthetic, reaction, centers, and, light, harvesting, complexes, they, also, are, found, within, dedicated, carotenoid, proteins, such, as, the, orange, carotenoid, protein, of, cyanobacteria, bacteria, produce, pigments, such, as, carotenoids, melanin, violacein, prodigiosin, pyocyanin, actinorhodin, and, zeaxanthin, cyanobacteria, produce, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, scytonemin, chlorophyll, a, chlorophyll, d, and, chlorophyll, f, purple, sulfur, bacteria, produce, bacteriochlorophyll, a, and, bacteriochlorophyll, b, in, cyanobacteria, many, other, carotenoids, exist, such, as, canthaxanthin, myxoxanthophyll, synechoxanthin, and, echinenone, pigmentation, is, used, by, many, animals, for, protection, by, means, of, camouflage, mimicry, or, warning, coloration, some, animals, including, fish, amphibians, and, cephalopods, use, pigmented, chromatophores, to, provide, camouflage, that, varies, to, match, the, background, pigmentation, is, used, in, signalling, between, animals, such, as, in, courtship, and, reproductive, behavior, for, example, some, cephalopods, use, their, chromatophores, to, communicate, the, photopigment, rhodopsin, intercepts, light, as, the, first, step, in, the, perception, of, light, skin, pigments, such, as, melanin, may, protect, tissues, from, sunburn, by, ultraviolet, radiation, however, some, biological, pigments, in, animals, such, as, heme, groups, that, help, to, carry, oxygen, in, the, blood, are, colored, as, a, result, of, happenstance, their, color, does, not, have, a, protective, or, signalling, function, pea, aphids, acyrthosiphon, pisum, two, spotted, spider, mites, tetranychus, urticae, and, gall, midges, family, cecidomyiidae, are, the, only, known, animals, capable, of, synthesizing, carotenoids, the, presence, of, genes, for, synthesizing, carotenoids, in, these, arthropods, has, been, attributed, to, independent, horizontal, gene, transfer, hgt, events, from, fungi, a, variety, of, diseases, and, abnormal, conditions, that, involve, pigmentation, are, in, humans, and, animals, either, from, absence, of, or, loss, of, pigmentation, or, pigment, cells, or, from, the, excess, production, of, pigment, carotenoids, are, the, most, common, group, of, pigments, found, in, nature, over, 600, different, kinds, of, carotenoids, are, found, in, animals, plants, and, microorganisms, marine, animals, are, incapable, of, making, their, own, carotenoids, and, thus, rely, on, plants, for, these, pigments, carotenoproteins, are, especially, common, among, marine, animals, these, complexes, are, responsible, for, the, various, colors, red, purple, blue, green, etc, to, these, marine, invertebrates, for, mating, rituals, and, camouflage, there, are, two, main, types, of, carotenoproteins, type, a, and, type, b, type, a, has, carotenoids, chromogen, which, are, stoichiometrically, associated, with, a, simple, protein, glycoprotein, the, second, type, type, b, has, carotenoids, which, are, associated, with, a, lipo, protein, and, is, usually, less, stable, while, type, a, is, commonly, found, in, the, surface, shells, and, skins, of, marine, invertebrates, type, b, is, usually, in, eggs, ovaries, and, blood, the, colors, and, characteristic, absorption, of, these, carotenoprotein, complexes, are, based, upon, the, chemical, binding, of, the, chromogen, and, the, protein, subunits, for, example, the, blue, carotenoprotein, linckiacyanin, has, about, 100, 200, carotenoid, molecules, per, every, complex, in, addition, the, functions, of, these, pigment, protein, complexes, also, change, their, chemical, structure, as, well, carotenoproteins, that, are, within, the, photosynthetic, structure, are, more, common, but, complicated, pigment, protein, complexes, that, are, outside, of, the, photosynthetic, system, are, less, common, but, have, a, simpler, structure, for, example, there, are, only, two, of, these, blue, astaxanthin, proteins, in, the, jellyfish, velella, velella, contains, only, about, 100, carotenoids, per, complex, a, common, carotenoid, in, animals, is, astaxanthin, which, gives, off, a, purple, blue, and, green, pigment, astaxanthin, s, color, is, formed, by, creating, complexes, with, proteins, in, a, certain, order, for, example, the, crustochrin, has, approximately, 20, astaxanthin, molecules, bonded, with, protein, when, the, complexes, interact, by, exciton, exciton, interaction, it, lowers, the, absorbance, maximum, changing, the, different, color, pigments, in, lobsters, there, are, various, types, of, astaxanthin, protein, complexes, present, the, first, one, is, crustacyanin, max, 632, nm, a, slate, blue, pigment, found, in, the, lobster, s, carapace, the, second, one, is, crustochrin, max, 409, a, yellow, pigment, which, is, found, on, the, outer, layer, of, the, carapace, lastly, the, lipoglycoprotein, and, ovoverdin, forms, a, bright, green, pigment, that, is, usually, present, in, the, outer, layers, of, the, carapace, and, the, lobster, eggs, tetrapyrroles, are, the, next, most, common, group, of, pigments, they, have, four, pyrrole, rings, each, ring, consisting, of, c, 4, h, 4, nh, the, main, role, of, the, tetrapyrroles, is, their, connection, in, the, biological, oxidation, process, tetrapyrroles, have, a, major, role, in, electron, transport, and, act, as, a, replacement, for, many, enzymes, they, also, have, a, role, in, the, pigmentation, of, the, marine, organism, s, tissues, melanin, is, a, class, of, compounds, that, serves, as, a, pigment, with, different, structures, responsible, for, dark, tan, yellowish, reddish, pigments, in, marine, animals, it, is, produced, as, the, amino, acid, tyrosine, is, converted, into, melanin, which, is, found, in, the, skin, hair, and, eyes, derived, from, aerobic, oxidation, of, phenols, they, are, polymers, there, are, several, different, types, of, melanins, considering, that, they, are, an, aggregate, of, smaller, component, molecules, such, as, nitrogen, containing, melanins, there, are, two, classes, of, pigments, black, and, brown, insoluble, eumelanins, which, are, derived, from, aerobic, oxidation, of, tyrosine, in, the, presence, of, tyrosinase, and, the, alkali, soluble, phaeomelanins, which, range, from, a, yellow, to, red, brown, color, arising, from, the, deviation, of, the, eumelanin, pathway, through, the, intervention, of, cysteine, and, or, glutathione, eumelanins, are, usually, found, in, the, skin, and, eyes, several, different, melanins, include, melanoprotein, dark, brown, melanin, that, is, stored, in, high, concentrations, in, the, ink, sac, of, the, cuttlefish, sepia, officianalis, echinoidea, found, in, sand, dollars, and, the, hearts, of, sea, urchins, holothuroidea, found, in, sea, cucumbers, and, ophiuroidea, found, in, brittle, and, snake, stars, these, melanins, are, possibly, polymers, which, arise, from, the, repeated, coupling, of, simple, bi, polyfunctional, monomeric, intermediates, or, of, high, molecular, weights, the, compounds, benzothiazole, and, tetrahydroisoquinoline, ring, systems, act, as, uv, absorbing, compounds, the, only, light, source, in, the, deep, sea, marine, animals, give, off, visible, light, energy, called, bioluminescence, a, subset, of, chemiluminescence, this, is, the, chemical, reaction, in, which, chemical, energy, is, converted, to, light, energy, it, is, estimated, that, 90, of, deep, sea, animals, produce, some, sort, of, bioluminescence, considering, that, a, large, proportion, of, the, visible, light, spectrum, is, absorbed, before, reaching, the, deep, sea, most, of, the, emitted, light, from, the, sea, animals, is, blue, and, green, however, some, species, may, emit, a, red, and, infrared, light, and, there, has, even, been, a, genus, that, is, found, to, emit, yellow, bioluminescence, the, organ, that, is, responsible, for, the, emission, of, bioluminescence, is, known, as, photophores, this, type, is, only, present, in, squid, and, fish, and, is, used, to, illuminate, their, ventral, surfaces, which, disguise, their, silhouettes, from, predators, the, uses, of, the, photophores, in, the, sea, animals, differ, such, as, lenses, for, controlling, intensity, of, color, and, the, intensity, of, the, light, produced, squids, have, both, photophores, and, chromatophores, which, controls, both, of, these, intensities, another, thing, that, is, responsible, for, the, emission, of, bioluminescence, which, is, evident, in, the, bursts, of, light, that, jellyfish, emit, start, with, a, luciferin, a, photogen, and, ends, with, the, light, emitter, a, photagogikon, luciferin, luciferase, salt, and, oxygen, react, and, combine, to, create, a, single, unit, called, photo, proteins, which, can, produce, light, when, reacted, with, another, molecule, such, as, ca, jellyfish, use, this, as, a, defense, mechanism, when, a, smaller, predator, is, attempting, to, devour, a, jellyfish, it, will, flash, its, lights, which, would, therefore, lure, a, larger, predator, and, chase, the, smaller, predator, away, it, is, also, used, as, mating, behavior, in, reef, building, coral, and, sea, anemones, they, fluoresce, light, is, absorbed, at, one, wavelength, and, re, emitted, at, another, these, pigments, may, act, as, natural, sunscreens, aid, in, photosynthesis, serve, as, warning, coloration, attract, mates, warn, rivals, or, confuse, predators, chromatophores, are, color, pigment, changing, cells, that, are, directly, stimulated, by, central, motor, neurons, they, are, primarily, used, for, quick, environmental, adaptation, for, camouflaging, the, process, of, changing, the, color, pigment, of, their, skin, relies, on, a, single, highly, developed, chromatophore, cell, and, many, muscles, nerves, glial, and, sheath, cells, chromatophores, contract, and, contain, vesicles, that, stores, three, different, liquid, pigments, each, color, is, indicated, by, the, three, types, of, chromatophore, cells, erythrophores, melanophores, and, xanthophores, the, first, type, is, the, erythrophores, which, contains, reddish, pigments, such, as, carotenoids, and, pteridines, the, second, type, is, the, melanophores, which, contains, black, and, brown, pigments, such, as, the, melanins, the, third, type, is, the, xanthophores, which, contains, yellow, pigments, in, the, forms, of, carotenoids, the, various, colors, are, made, by, the, combination, of, the, different, layers, of, the, chromatophores, these, cells, are, usually, located, beneath, the, skin, or, scale, the, animals, there, are, two, categories, of, colors, generated, by, the, cell, biochromes, and, schematochromes, biochromes, are, colors, chemically, formed, microscopic, natural, pigments, their, chemical, composition, is, created, to, take, in, some, color, of, light, and, reflect, the, rest, in, contrast, schematochromes, structural, colors, are, colors, created, by, light, reflections, from, a, colorless, surface, and, refractions, by, tissues, schematochromes, act, like, prisms, refracting, and, dispersing, visible, light, to, the, surroundings, which, will, eventually, reflect, a, specific, combination, of, colors, these, categories, are, determined, by, the, movement, of, pigments, within, the, chromatophores, the, physiological, color, changes, are, short, term, and, fast, found, in, fishes, and, are, a, result, from, an, animal, s, response, to, a, change, in, the, environment, in, contrast, the, morphological, color, changes, are, long, term, changes, occurs, in, different, stages, of, the, animal, and, are, due, to, the, change, of, numbers, of, chromatophores, to, change, the, color, pigments, transparency, or, opacity, the, cells, alter, in, form, and, size, and, stretch, or, contract, their, outer, covering, due, to, damage, from, uv, a, and, uv, b, marine, animals, have, evolved, to, have, compounds, that, absorb, uv, light, and, act, as, sunscreen, mycosporine, like, amino, acids, maas, can, absorb, uv, rays, at, 310, 360, nm, melanin, is, another, well, known, uv, protector, carotenoids, and, photopigments, both, indirectly, act, as, photo, protective, pigments, as, they, quench, oxygen, free, radicals, they, also, supplement, photosynthetic, pigments, that, absorb, light, energy, in, the, blue, region, it, s, known, that, animals, use, their, color, patterns, to, warn, off, predators, however, it, has, been, observed, that, a, sponge, pigment, mimicked, a, chemical, which, involved, the, regulation, of, moulting, of, an, amphipod, that, was, known, to, prey, on, sponges, so, whenever, that, amphipod, eats, the, sponge, the, chemical, pigments, prevents, the, moulting, and, the, amphipod, eventually, dies, coloration, in, invertebrates, varies, based, on, the, depth, water, temperature, food, source, currents, geographic, location, light, exposure, and, sedimentation, for, example, the, amount, of, carotenoid, a, certain, sea, anemone, decreases, as, we, go, deeper, into, the, ocean, thus, the, marine, life, that, resides, on, deeper, waters, is, less, brilliant, than, the, organisms, that, live, in, well, lit, areas, due, to, the, reduction, of, pigments, in, the, colonies, of, the, colonial, ascidian, cyanophyte, symbiosis, trididemnum, solidum, their, colors, are, different, depending, on, the, light, regime, in, which, they, live, the, colonies, that, are, exposed, to, full, sunlight, are, heavily, calcified, thicker, and, are, white, in, contrast, the, colonies, that, live, in, shaded, areas, have, more, phycoerythrin, pigment, that, absorbs, green, in, comparison, to, phycocyanin, pigment, that, absorbs, red, thinner, and, are, purple, the, purple, color, in, the, shaded, colonies, are, mainly, due, to, the, phycobilin, pigment, of, the, algae, meaning, the, variation, of, exposure, in, light, changes, the, colors, of, these, colonies, aposematism, is, the, warning, coloration, to, signal, potential, predators, to, stay, away, in, many, chromodorid, nudibranchs, they, take, in, distasteful, and, toxic, chemicals, emitted, from, sponges, and, store, them, in, their, repugnatorial, glands, located, around, the, mantle, edge, predators, of, nudibranchs, have, learned, to, avoid, these, certain, nudibranchs, based, on, their, bright, color, patterns, preys, also, protect, themselves, by, their, toxic, compounds, ranging, from, a, variety, of, organic, and, inorganic, compounds, pigments, of, marine, animals, serve, several, different, purposes, other, than, defensive, roles, some, pigments, are, known, to, protect, against, uv, see, photo, protective, pigments, in, the, nudibranch, nembrotha, kubaryana, tetrapyrrole, pigment, 13, has, been, found, to, be, a, potent, antimicrobial, agent, also, in, this, creature, tamjamines, a, b, c, e, and, f, has, shown, antimicrobial, antitumor, and, immunosuppressive, activities, sesquiterpenoids, are, recognized, for, their, blue, and, purple, colors, but, it, has, also, been, reported, to, exhibit, various, bioactivities, such, as, antibacterial, immunoregulating, antimicrobial, and, cytotoxic, as, well, as, the, inhibitory, activity, against, cell, division, in, the, fertilized, sea, urchin, and, ascidian, eggs, several, other, pigments, have, been, shown, to, be, cytotoxic, in, fact, two, new, carotenoids, that, were, isolated, from, a, sponge, called, phakellia, stelliderma, showed, mild, cytotoxicity, against, mouse, leukemia, cells, other, pigments, with, medical, involvements, include, scytonemin, topsentins, and, debromohymenialdisine, have, several, lead, compounds, in, the, field, of, inflammation, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, osteoarthritis, respectively, there, s, evidence, that, topsentins, are, potent, mediators, of, immunogenic, inflation, and, topsentin, and, scytonemin, are, potent, inhibitors, of, neurogenic, inflammation, pigments, may, be, extracted, and, used, as, dyes, pigments, such, as, astaxanthin, and, lycopene, are, used, as, dietary, supplements
