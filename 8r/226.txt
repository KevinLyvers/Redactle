an, egg, is, an, organic, vessel, grown, by, an, animal, to, carry, a, possibly, fertilized, egg, cell, a, zygote, and, to, incubate, from, it, an, embryo, within, the, egg, until, the, embryo, has, become, an, animal, fetus, that, can, survive, on, its, own, at, which, point, the, animal, hatches, most, arthropods, vertebrates, excluding, live, bearing, mammals, and, mollusks, lay, eggs, although, some, such, as, scorpions, do, not, reptile, eggs, bird, eggs, and, monotreme, eggs, are, laid, out, of, water, and, are, surrounded, by, a, protective, shell, either, flexible, or, inflexible, eggs, laid, on, land, or, in, nests, are, usually, kept, within, a, warm, and, favorable, temperature, range, while, the, embryo, grows, when, the, embryo, is, adequately, developed, it, hatches, i, e, breaks, out, of, the, egg, s, shell, some, embryos, have, a, temporary, egg, tooth, they, use, to, crack, pip, or, break, the, eggshell, or, covering, the, largest, recorded, egg, is, from, a, whale, shark, and, was, 30, cm, 14, cm, 9, cm, 11, 8, in, 5, 5, in, 3, 5, in, in, size, whale, shark, eggs, typically, hatch, within, the, mother, at, 1, 5, kg, 3, 3, lb, and, up, to, 17, 8, cm, 14, cm, 7, 0, in, 5, 5, in, the, ostrich, egg, is, the, largest, egg, of, any, living, bird, 130, though, the, extinct, elephant, bird, and, some, non, avian, dinosaurs, laid, larger, eggs, the, bee, hummingbird, produces, the, smallest, known, bird, egg, which, measures, between, 6, 35, 11, 4, millimetres, 0, 250, 0, 449, in, long, and, weighs, half, of, a, gram, around, 0, 02, oz, 132, some, eggs, laid, by, reptiles, and, most, fish, amphibians, insects, and, other, invertebrates, can, be, even, smaller, reproductive, structures, similar, to, the, egg, in, other, kingdoms, are, termed, spores, or, in, spermatophytes, seeds, or, in, gametophytes, egg, cells, several, major, groups, of, animals, typically, have, readily, distinguishable, eggs, the, most, common, reproductive, strategy, for, fish, is, known, as, oviparity, in, which, the, female, lays, undeveloped, eggs, that, are, externally, fertilized, by, a, male, typically, large, numbers, of, eggs, are, laid, at, one, time, an, adult, female, cod, can, produce, 4, 6, million, eggs, in, one, spawning, and, the, eggs, are, then, left, to, develop, without, parental, care, when, the, larvae, hatch, from, the, egg, they, often, carry, the, remains, of, the, yolk, in, a, yolk, sac, which, continues, to, nourish, the, larvae, for, a, few, days, as, they, learn, how, to, swim, once, the, yolk, is, consumed, there, is, a, critical, point, after, which, they, must, learn, how, to, hunt, and, feed, or, they, will, die, a, few, fish, notably, the, rays, and, most, sharks, use, ovoviviparity, in, which, the, eggs, are, fertilized, and, develop, internally, however, the, larvae, still, grow, inside, the, egg, consuming, the, egg, s, yolk, and, without, any, direct, nourishment, from, the, mother, the, mother, then, gives, birth, to, relatively, mature, young, in, certain, instances, the, physically, most, developed, offspring, will, devour, its, smaller, siblings, for, further, nutrition, while, still, within, the, mother, s, body, this, is, known, as, intrauterine, cannibalism, in, certain, scenarios, some, fish, such, as, the, hammerhead, shark, and, reef, shark, are, viviparous, with, the, egg, being, fertilized, and, developed, internally, but, with, the, mother, also, providing, direct, nourishment, the, eggs, of, fish, and, amphibians, are, jellylike, cartilaginous, fish, sharks, skates, rays, chimaeras, eggs, are, fertilized, internally, and, exhibit, a, wide, variety, of, both, internal, and, external, embryonic, development, most, fish, species, spawn, eggs, that, are, fertilized, externally, typically, with, the, male, inseminating, the, eggs, after, the, female, lays, them, these, eggs, do, not, have, a, shell, and, would, dry, out, in, the, air, even, air, breathing, amphibians, lay, their, eggs, in, water, or, in, protective, foam, as, with, the, coast, foam, nest, treefrog, chiromantis, xerampelina, bird, eggs, are, laid, by, females, and, incubated, for, a, time, that, varies, according, to, the, species, a, single, young, hatches, from, each, egg, average, clutch, sizes, range, from, one, as, in, condors, to, about, 17, the, grey, partridge, some, birds, lay, eggs, even, when, not, fertilized, e, g, hens, it, is, not, uncommon, for, pet, owners, to, find, their, lone, bird, nesting, on, a, clutch, of, unfertilized, eggs, which, are, sometimes, called, wind, eggs, the, default, colour, of, vertebrate, eggs, is, the, white, of, the, calcium, carbonate, from, which, the, shells, are, made, but, some, birds, mainly, passerines, produce, coloured, eggs, the, colour, comes, from, pigments, deposited, on, top, of, the, calcium, carbonate, base, biliverdin, and, its, zinc, chelate, and, bilirubin, give, a, green, or, blue, ground, colour, while, protoporphyrin, ix, produces, reds, and, browns, as, a, ground, colour, or, as, spotting, non, passerines, typically, have, white, eggs, except, in, some, ground, nesting, groups, such, as, the, charadriiformes, sandgrouse, and, nightjars, where, camouflage, is, necessary, and, some, parasitic, cuckoos, which, have, to, match, the, passerine, host, s, egg, most, passerines, in, contrast, lay, coloured, eggs, even, if, there, is, no, need, of, cryptic, colors, however, some, have, suggested, that, the, protoporphyrin, markings, on, passerine, eggs, actually, act, to, reduce, brittleness, by, acting, as, a, solid, state, lubricant, if, there, is, insufficient, calcium, available, in, the, local, soil, the, egg, shell, may, be, thin, especially, in, a, circle, around, the, broad, end, protoporphyrin, speckling, compensates, for, this, and, increases, inversely, to, the, amount, of, calcium, in, the, soil, for, the, same, reason, later, eggs, in, a, clutch, are, more, spotted, than, early, ones, as, the, female, s, store, of, calcium, is, depleted, the, color, of, individual, eggs, is, also, genetically, influenced, and, appears, to, be, inherited, through, the, mother, only, suggesting, that, the, gene, responsible, for, pigmentation, is, on, the, sex, determining, w, chromosome, female, birds, are, wz, males, zz, it, used, to, be, thought, that, color, was, applied, to, the, shell, immediately, before, laying, but, subsequent, research, shows, that, coloration, is, an, integral, part, of, the, development, of, the, shell, with, the, same, protein, responsible, for, depositing, calcium, carbonate, or, protoporphyrins, when, there, is, a, lack, of, that, mineral, in, species, such, as, the, common, guillemot, which, nest, in, large, groups, each, female, s, eggs, have, very, different, markings, making, it, easier, for, females, to, identify, their, own, eggs, on, the, crowded, cliff, ledges, on, which, they, breed, yolks, of, birds, eggs, are, yellow, from, carotenoids, it, is, affected, by, their, living, conditions, and, diet, bird, eggshells, are, diverse, for, example, tiny, pores, in, bird, eggshells, allow, the, embryo, to, breathe, the, domestic, hen, s, egg, has, around, 7000, pores, some, bird, eggshells, have, a, coating, of, vaterite, spherules, which, is, a, rare, polymorph, of, calcium, carbonate, in, greater, ani, crotophaga, major, this, vaterite, coating, is, thought, to, act, as, a, shock, absorber, protecting, the, calcite, shell, from, fracture, during, incubation, such, as, colliding, with, other, eggs, in, the, nest, most, bird, eggs, have, an, oval, shape, with, one, end, rounded, and, the, other, more, pointed, this, shape, results, from, the, egg, being, forced, through, the, oviduct, muscles, contract, the, oviduct, behind, the, egg, pushing, it, forward, the, egg, s, wall, is, still, shapeable, and, the, pointed, end, develops, at, the, back, one, hypothesis, is, that, long, pointy, eggs, are, an, incidental, consequence, of, having, a, streamlined, body, typical, of, birds, with, strong, flying, abilities, flight, narrows, the, oviduct, which, changes, the, type, of, egg, a, bird, can, lay, cliff, nesting, birds, often, have, highly, conical, eggs, they, are, less, likely, to, roll, off, tending, instead, to, roll, around, in, a, tight, circle, this, trait, is, likely, to, have, arisen, due, to, evolution, via, natural, selection, in, contrast, many, hole, nesting, birds, have, nearly, spherical, eggs, many, animals, feed, on, eggs, for, example, principal, predators, of, the, black, oystercatcher, s, eggs, include, raccoons, skunks, mink, river, and, sea, otters, gulls, crows, and, foxes, the, stoat, mustela, erminea, and, long, tailed, weasel, m, frenata, steal, ducks, eggs, snakes, of, the, genera, dasypeltis, and, elachistodon, specialize, in, eating, eggs, brood, parasitism, occurs, in, birds, when, one, species, lays, its, eggs, in, the, nest, of, another, in, some, cases, the, host, s, eggs, are, removed, or, eaten, by, the, female, or, expelled, by, her, chick, brood, parasites, include, the, cowbirds, and, many, old, world, cuckoos, like, amphibians, amniotes, are, air, breathing, vertebrates, but, they, have, complex, eggs, or, embryos, including, an, amniotic, membrane, amniotes, include, reptiles, including, dinosaurs, and, their, descendants, birds, and, mammals, reptile, eggs, are, often, rubbery, and, are, always, initially, white, they, are, able, to, survive, in, the, air, often, the, sex, of, the, developing, embryo, is, determined, by, the, temperature, of, the, surroundings, with, cooler, temperatures, favouring, males, not, all, reptiles, lay, eggs, some, are, viviparous, live, birth, dinosaurs, laid, eggs, some, of, which, have, been, preserved, as, petrified, fossils, among, mammals, early, extinct, species, laid, eggs, as, do, platypuses, and, echidnas, spiny, anteaters, platypuses, and, two, genera, of, echidna, are, australian, monotremes, marsupial, and, placental, mammals, do, not, lay, eggs, but, their, unborn, young, do, have, the, complex, tissues, that, identify, amniotes, the, eggs, of, the, egg, laying, mammals, the, platypus, and, the, echidnas, are, macrolecithal, eggs, very, much, like, those, of, reptiles, the, eggs, of, marsupials, are, likewise, macrolecithal, but, rather, small, and, develop, inside, the, body, of, the, female, but, do, not, form, a, placenta, the, young, are, born, at, a, very, early, stage, and, can, be, classified, as, a, larva, in, the, biological, sense, in, placental, mammals, the, egg, itself, is, void, of, yolk, but, develops, an, umbilical, cord, from, structures, that, in, reptiles, would, form, the, yolk, sac, receiving, nutrients, from, the, mother, the, fetus, completes, the, development, while, inside, the, uterus, eggs, are, common, among, invertebrates, including, insects, spiders, mollusks, and, crustaceans, all, sexually, reproducing, life, including, both, plants, and, animals, produces, gametes, the, male, gamete, cell, sperm, is, usually, motile, whereas, the, female, gamete, cell, the, ovum, is, generally, larger, and, sessile, the, male, and, female, gametes, combine, to, produce, the, zygote, cell, in, multicellular, organisms, the, zygote, subsequently, divides, in, an, organised, manner, into, smaller, more, specialised, cells, so, that, this, new, individual, develops, into, an, embryo, in, most, animals, the, embryo, is, the, sessile, initial, stage, of, the, individual, life, cycle, and, is, followed, by, the, emergence, that, is, the, hatching, of, a, motile, stage, the, zygote, or, the, ovum, itself, or, the, sessile, organic, vessel, containing, the, developing, embryo, may, be, called, the, egg, a, recent, proposal, suggests, that, the, phylotypic, animal, body, plans, originated, in, cell, aggregates, before, the, existence, of, an, egg, stage, of, development, eggs, in, this, view, were, later, evolutionary, innovations, selected, for, their, role, in, ensuring, genetic, uniformity, among, the, cells, of, incipient, multicellular, organisms, the, cycle, of, the, egg, s, formation, is, started, by, the, gamete, ovum, being, released, ovulated, and, egg, formation, being, started, the, finished, egg, is, then, ovipositioned, and, eventual, egg, incubation, can, start, scientists, often, classify, animal, reproduction, according, to, the, degree, of, development, that, occurs, before, the, new, individuals, are, expelled, from, the, adult, body, and, by, the, yolk, which, the, egg, provides, to, nourish, the, embryo, vertebrate, eggs, can, be, classified, by, the, relative, amount, of, yolk, simple, eggs, with, little, yolk, are, called, microlecithal, medium, sized, eggs, with, some, yolk, are, called, mesolecithal, and, large, eggs, with, a, large, concentrated, yolk, are, called, macrolecithal, this, classification, of, eggs, is, based, on, the, eggs, of, chordates, though, the, basic, principle, extends, to, the, whole, animal, kingdom, small, eggs, with, little, yolk, are, called, microlecithal, the, yolk, is, evenly, distributed, so, the, cleavage, of, the, egg, cell, cuts, through, and, divides, the, egg, into, cells, of, fairly, similar, sizes, in, sponges, and, cnidarians, the, dividing, eggs, develop, directly, into, a, simple, larva, rather, like, a, morula, with, cilia, in, cnidarians, this, stage, is, called, the, planula, and, either, develops, directly, into, the, adult, animals, or, forms, new, adult, individuals, through, a, process, of, budding, microlecithal, eggs, require, minimal, yolk, mass, such, eggs, are, found, in, flatworms, roundworms, annelids, bivalves, echinoderms, the, lancelet, and, in, most, marine, arthropods, in, anatomically, simple, animals, such, as, cnidarians, and, flatworms, the, fetal, development, can, be, quite, short, and, even, microlecithal, eggs, can, undergo, direct, development, these, small, eggs, can, be, produced, in, large, numbers, in, animals, with, high, egg, mortality, microlecithal, eggs, are, the, norm, as, in, bivalves, and, marine, arthropods, however, the, latter, are, more, complex, anatomically, than, e, g, flatworms, and, the, small, microlecithal, eggs, do, not, allow, full, development, instead, the, eggs, hatch, into, larvae, which, may, be, markedly, different, from, the, adult, animal, in, placental, mammals, where, the, embryo, is, nourished, by, the, mother, throughout, the, whole, fetal, period, the, egg, is, reduced, in, size, to, essentially, a, naked, egg, cell, mesolecithal, eggs, have, comparatively, more, yolk, than, the, microlecithal, eggs, the, yolk, is, concentrated, in, one, part, of, the, egg, the, vegetal, pole, with, the, cell, nucleus, and, most, of, the, cytoplasm, in, the, other, the, animal, pole, the, cell, cleavage, is, uneven, and, mainly, concentrated, in, the, cytoplasma, rich, animal, pole, the, larger, yolk, content, of, the, mesolecithal, eggs, allows, for, a, longer, fetal, development, comparatively, anatomically, simple, animals, will, be, able, to, go, through, the, full, development, and, leave, the, egg, in, a, form, reminiscent, of, the, adult, animal, this, is, the, situation, found, in, hagfish, and, some, snails, animals, with, smaller, size, eggs, or, more, advanced, anatomy, will, still, have, a, distinct, larval, stage, though, the, larva, will, be, basically, similar, to, the, adult, animal, as, in, lampreys, coelacanth, and, the, salamanders, eggs, with, a, large, yolk, are, called, macrolecithal, the, eggs, are, usually, few, in, number, and, the, embryos, have, enough, food, to, go, through, full, fetal, development, in, most, groups, macrolecithal, eggs, are, only, found, in, selected, representatives, of, two, groups, cephalopods, and, vertebrates, macrolecithal, eggs, go, through, a, different, type, of, development, than, other, eggs, due, to, the, large, size, of, the, yolk, the, cell, division, can, not, split, up, the, yolk, mass, the, fetus, instead, develops, as, a, plate, like, structure, on, top, of, the, yolk, mass, and, only, envelopes, it, at, a, later, stage, a, portion, of, the, yolk, mass, is, still, present, as, an, external, or, semi, external, yolk, sac, at, hatching, in, many, groups, this, form, of, fetal, development, is, common, in, bony, fish, even, though, their, eggs, can, be, quite, small, despite, their, macrolecithal, structure, the, small, size, of, the, eggs, does, not, allow, for, direct, development, and, the, eggs, hatch, to, a, larval, stage, fry, in, terrestrial, animals, with, macrolecithal, eggs, the, large, volume, to, surface, ratio, necessitates, structures, to, aid, in, transport, of, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, and, for, storage, of, waste, products, so, that, the, embryo, does, not, suffocate, or, get, poisoned, from, its, own, waste, while, inside, the, egg, see, amniote, in, addition, to, bony, fish, and, cephalopods, macrolecithal, eggs, are, found, in, cartilaginous, fish, reptiles, birds, and, monotreme, mammals, the, eggs, of, the, coelacanths, can, reach, a, size, of, 9, cm, 3, 5, in, in, diameter, and, the, young, go, through, full, development, while, in, the, uterus, living, on, the, copious, yolk, animals, are, commonly, classified, by, their, manner, of, reproduction, at, the, most, general, level, distinguishing, egg, laying, latin, oviparous, from, live, bearing, latin, viviparous, these, classifications, are, divided, into, more, detail, according, to, the, development, that, occurs, before, the, offspring, are, expelled, from, the, adult, s, body, traditionally, the, term, hemotrophic, derives, from, the, latin, for, blood, feeding, contrasted, with, histotrophic, for, tissue, feeding, eggs, laid, by, many, different, species, including, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and, fish, have, probably, been, eaten, by, people, for, millennia, popular, choices, for, egg, consumption, are, chicken, duck, roe, and, caviar, but, by, a, wide, margin, the, egg, most, often, humanly, consumed, is, the, chicken, egg, typically, unfertilized, according, to, the, kashrut, that, is, the, set, of, jewish, dietary, laws, kosher, food, may, be, consumed, according, to, halakha, jewish, law, kosher, meat, and, milk, or, derivatives, cannot, be, mixed, deuteronomy, 14, 21, or, stored, together, eggs, are, considered, pareve, neither, meat, nor, dairy, despite, being, an, animal, product, and, can, be, mixed, with, either, milk, or, kosher, meat, mayonnaise, for, instance, is, usually, marked, pareve, despite, by, definition, containing, egg, many, vaccines, for, infectious, diseases, are, produced, in, fertile, chicken, eggs, the, basis, of, this, technology, was, the, discovery, in, 1931, by, alice, miles, woodruff, and, ernest, william, goodpasture, at, vanderbilt, university, that, the, rickettsia, and, viruses, that, cause, a, variety, of, diseases, will, grow, in, chicken, embryos, this, enabled, the, development, of, vaccines, against, influenza, chicken, pox, smallpox, yellow, fever, typhus, rocky, mountain, spotted, fever, and, other, diseases, eggs, are, an, important, symbol, in, folklore, and, mythology, often, representing, life, and, rebirth, healing, and, protection, and, sometimes, featuring, in, creation, myths, egg, decoration, is, a, common, practice, in, many, cultures, worldwide, christians, view, easter, eggs, as, symbolic, of, the, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, a, popular, easter, tradition, in, some, parts, of, the, world, is, the, decoration, of, hard, boiled, eggs, usually, by, dyeing, but, often, by, hand, painting, or, spray, painting, adults, often, hide, the, eggs, for, children, to, find, an, activity, known, as, an, easter, egg, hunt, a, similar, tradition, of, egg, painting, exists, in, areas, of, the, world, influenced, by, the, culture, of, persia, before, the, spring, equinox, in, the, persian, new, year, tradition, called, norouz, each, family, member, decorates, a, hard, boiled, egg, and, sets, them, together, in, a, bowl, the, tradition, of, a, dancing, egg, is, held, during, the, feast, of, corpus, christi, in, barcelona, and, other, catalan, cities, since, the, 16th, century, it, consists, of, an, emptied, egg, positioned, over, the, water, jet, from, a, fountain, which, starts, turning, without, falling, although, a, food, item, raw, eggs, are, sometimes, thrown, at, houses, cars, or, people, this, act, known, commonly, as, egging, in, the, various, english, speaking, countries, is, a, minor, form, of, vandalism, and, therefore, usually, a, criminal, offense, and, is, capable, of, damaging, property, egg, whites, can, degrade, certain, types, of, vehicle, paint, as, well, as, potentially, causing, serious, eye, injury, on, halloween, for, example, trick, or, treaters, have, been, known, to, throw, eggs, and, sometimes, flour, at, property, or, people, from, whom, they, received, nothing, eggs, are, also, often, thrown, in, protests, as, they, are, inexpensive, and, nonlethal, yet, very, messy, when, broken, egg, collecting, was, a, popular, hobby, in, some, cultures, including, european, australians, traditionally, the, embryo, would, be, removed, before, a, collector, stored, the, egg, shell, collecting, eggs, of, wild, birds, is, now, banned, by, many, jurisdictions, as, the, practice, can, threaten, rare, species, in, the, united, kingdom, the, practice, is, prohibited, by, the, protection, of, birds, act, 1954, and, wildlife, and, countryside, act, 1981, on, the, other, hand, ongoing, underground, trading, is, becoming, a, serious, issue, since, the, protection, of, wild, bird, eggs, was, regulated, early, collections, have, come, to, the, museums, as, curiosities, for, example, the, australian, museum, hosts, a, collection, of, about, 20, 000, registered, clutches, of, eggs, and, the, collection, in, western, australia, museum, has, been, archived, in, a, gallery, scientists, regard, egg, collections, as, a, good, natural, history, data, as, the, details, recorded, in, the, collectors, notes, have, helped, them, to, understand, birds, nesting, behaviors
