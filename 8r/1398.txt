tobacco, mosaic, virus, tmv, is, a, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, virus, species, in, the, genus, tobamovirus, that, infects, a, wide, range, of, plants, especially, tobacco, and, other, members, of, the, family, solanaceae, the, infection, causes, characteristic, patterns, such, as, mosaic, like, mottling, and, discoloration, on, the, leaves, hence, the, name, tmv, was, the, first, virus, to, be, discovered, although, it, was, known, from, the, late, 19th, century, that, a, non, bacterial, infectious, disease, was, damaging, tobacco, crops, it, was, not, until, 1930, that, the, infectious, agent, was, determined, to, be, a, virus, it, is, the, first, pathogen, identified, as, a, virus, the, virus, was, crystallised, by, wendell, meredith, stanley, it, has, a, similar, size, to, the, largest, synthetic, molecule, known, as, pg5, in, 1886, adolf, mayer, first, described, the, tobacco, mosaic, disease, that, could, be, transferred, between, plants, similar, to, bacterial, infections, in, 1892, dmitri, ivanovsky, gave, the, first, concrete, evidence, for, the, existence, of, a, non, bacterial, infectious, agent, showing, that, infected, sap, remained, infectious, even, after, filtering, through, the, finest, chamberland, filters, later, in, 1903, ivanovsky, published, a, paper, describing, abnormal, crystal, intracellular, inclusions, in, the, host, cells, of, the, affected, tobacco, plants, and, argued, the, connection, between, these, inclusions, and, the, infectious, agent, however, ivanovsky, remained, rather, convinced, despite, repeated, failures, to, produce, evidence, that, the, causal, agent, was, an, unculturable, bacterium, too, small, to, be, retained, on, the, employed, chamberland, filters, and, to, be, detected, in, the, light, microscope, in, 1898, martinus, beijerinck, independently, replicated, ivanovsky, s, filtration, experiments, and, then, showed, that, the, infectious, agent, was, able, to, reproduce, and, multiply, in, the, host, cells, of, the, tobacco, plant, beijerinck, adopted, the, term, of, virus, to, indicate, that, the, causal, agent, of, tobacco, mosaic, disease, was, of, non, bacterial, nature, tobacco, mosaic, virus, was, the, first, virus, to, be, crystallized, it, was, achieved, by, wendell, meredith, stanley, in, 1935, who, also, showed, that, tmv, remains, active, even, after, crystallization, for, his, work, he, was, awarded, 1, 4, of, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1946, even, though, it, was, later, shown, some, of, his, conclusions, in, particular, that, the, crystals, were, pure, protein, and, assembled, by, autocatalysis, were, incorrect, the, first, electron, microscopical, images, of, tmv, were, made, in, 1939, by, gustav, kausche, edgar, pfankuch, and, helmut, ruska, the, brother, of, nobel, prize, winner, ernst, ruska, in, 1955, heinz, fraenkel, conrat, and, robley, williams, showed, that, purified, tmv, rna, and, its, capsid, coat, protein, assemble, by, themselves, to, functional, viruses, indicating, that, this, is, the, most, stable, structure, the, one, with, the, lowest, free, energy, the, crystallographer, rosalind, franklin, worked, for, stanley, for, about, a, month, at, berkeley, and, later, designed, and, built, a, model, of, tmv, for, the, 1958, world, s, fair, at, brussels, in, 1958, she, speculated, that, the, virus, was, hollow, not, solid, and, hypothesized, that, the, rna, of, tmv, is, single, stranded, this, conjecture, was, proven, to, be, correct, after, her, death, and, is, now, known, to, be, the, strand, the, investigations, of, tobacco, mosaic, disease, and, subsequent, discovery, of, its, viral, nature, were, instrumental, in, the, establishment, of, the, general, concepts, of, virology, tobacco, mosaic, virus, has, a, rod, like, appearance, its, capsid, is, made, from, 2130, molecules, of, coat, protein, and, one, molecule, of, genomic, single, strand, rna, 6400, bases, long, the, coat, protein, self, assembles, into, the, rod, like, helical, structure, 16, 3, proteins, per, helix, turn, around, the, rna, which, forms, a, hairpin, loop, structure, see, the, electron, micrograph, above, the, structural, organization, of, the, virus, gives, stability, the, protein, monomer, consists, of, 158, amino, acids, which, are, assembled, into, four, main, alpha, helices, which, are, joined, by, a, prominent, loop, proximal, to, the, axis, of, the, virion, virions, are, 300, nm, in, length, and, 18, nm, in, diameter, negatively, stained, electron, microphotographs, show, a, distinct, inner, channel, of, radius, 2, nm, the, rna, is, located, at, a, radius, of, 4, nm, and, is, protected, from, the, action, of, cellular, enzymes, by, the, coat, protein, x, ray, fiber, diffraction, structure, of, the, intact, virus, was, studied, based, on, an, electron, density, map, at, 3, 6, resolution, inside, the, capsid, helix, near, the, core, is, the, coiled, rna, molecule, which, is, made, up, of, 6, 395, 10, nucleotides, the, structure, of, the, virus, plays, an, important, role, in, the, recognition, of, the, viral, dna, this, happens, due, to, the, formation, of, an, obligatory, intermediate, produced, from, a, protein, allows, the, virus, to, recognize, a, specific, rna, hairpin, structure, the, intermediate, induces, the, nucleation, of, tmv, self, assembly, by, binding, with, the, hairpin, structure, the, tmv, genome, consists, of, a, 6, 3, 6, 5, kbp, single, stranded, ss, rna, the, 3, terminus, has, a, trna, like, structure, and, the, 5, terminus, has, a, methylated, nucleotide, cap, m7g5, pppg, the, genome, encodes, 4, open, reading, frames, orfs, two, of, which, produce, a, single, protein, due, to, ribosomal, readthrough, of, a, leaky, uag, stop, codon, the, 4, genes, encode, a, replicase, with, methyltransferase, and, rna, helicase, domains, an, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, a, so, called, movement, protein, mp, and, a, capsid, protein, cp, the, coding, sequence, starts, with, the, first, reading, frame, which, is, 69, nucleotides, away, from, the, 5, end, of, the, rna, the, noncoding, region, at, the, 5, end, can, be, varied, in, different, individual, virions, but, there, hasn, t, been, any, variation, found, between, virions, in, the, noncoding, region, at, the, 3, end, tmv, is, a, thermostable, virus, on, a, dried, leaf, it, can, withstand, up, to, 50, c, 120, degree, fahrenheit, for, 30, minutes, tmv, has, an, index, of, refraction, of, about, 1, 57, tmv, does, not, have, a, distinct, overwintering, structure, rather, it, will, over, winter, in, infected, tobacco, stalks, and, leaves, in, the, soil, on, the, surface, of, contaminated, seed, tmv, can, even, survive, in, contaminated, tobacco, products, for, many, years, so, smokers, can, accidentally, transmit, it, by, touch, although, not, in, the, smoke, itself, with, the, direct, contact, with, host, plants, through, its, vectors, normally, insects, such, as, aphids, and, leafhoppers, tmv, will, go, through, the, infection, process, and, then, the, replication, process, after, its, multiplication, it, enters, the, neighboring, cells, through, plasmodesmata, the, infection, does, not, spread, through, contact, with, insects, but, instead, spreads, by, direct, contact, to, the, neighboring, cells, for, its, smooth, entry, tmv, produces, a, 30, k, da, movement, protein, called, p30, which, enlarges, the, plasmodesmata, tmv, most, likely, moves, from, cell, to, cell, as, a, complex, of, the, rna, p30, and, replicate, proteins, it, can, also, spread, through, phloem, for, longer, distance, movement, within, the, plant, moreover, tmv, can, be, transmitted, from, one, plant, to, another, by, direct, contact, although, tmv, does, not, have, defined, transmission, vectors, the, virus, can, be, easily, transmitted, from, the, infected, hosts, to, the, healthy, plants, by, human, handling, following, entry, into, its, host, via, mechanical, inoculation, tmv, uncoats, itself, to, release, its, viral, rna, strand, as, uncoating, occurs, the, methel, pol, gene, is, translated, to, make, the, capping, enzyme, methel, and, the, rna, polymerase, then, the, viral, genome, will, further, replicate, to, produce, multiple, mrnas, via, a, rna, intermediate, primed, by, the, trna, his, at, the, rna, 3, end, the, resulting, mrnas, encode, several, proteins, including, the, coat, protein, and, an, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, rdrp, as, well, as, the, movement, protein, thus, tmv, can, replicate, its, own, genome, after, the, coat, protein, and, rna, genome, of, tmv, have, been, synthesized, they, spontaneously, assemble, into, complete, tmv, virions, in, a, highly, organized, process, the, protomers, come, together, to, form, disks, or, lockwashers, composed, of, two, layers, of, protomers, arranged, in, a, helix, the, helical, capsid, grows, by, the, addition, of, protomers, to, the, end, of, the, rod, as, the, rod, lengthens, the, rna, passes, through, a, channel, in, its, center, and, forms, a, loop, at, the, growing, end, in, this, way, the, rna, can, easily, fit, as, a, spiral, into, the, interior, of, the, helical, capsid, like, other, plant, pathogenic, viruses, tmv, has, a, very, wide, host, range, and, has, different, effects, depending, on, the, host, being, infected, tobacco, mosaic, virus, has, been, known, to, cause, a, production, loss, for, flue, cured, tobacco, of, up, to, two, percent, in, north, carolina, it, is, known, to, infect, members, of, nine, plant, families, and, at, least, 125, individual, species, including, tobacco, tomato, pepper, all, members, of, the, solanaceae, cucumbers, a, number, of, ornamental, flowers, and, beans, including, phaseolus, vulgaris, and, vigna, unguiculata, there, are, many, different, strains, the, first, symptom, of, this, virus, disease, is, a, light, green, coloration, between, the, veins, of, young, leaves, this, is, followed, quickly, by, the, development, of, a, mosaic, or, mottled, pattern, of, light, and, dark, green, areas, in, the, leaves, rugosity, may, also, be, seen, where, the, infected, plant, leaves, display, small, localized, random, wrinkles, these, symptoms, develop, quickly, and, are, more, pronounced, on, younger, leaves, its, infection, does, not, result, in, plant, death, but, if, infection, occurs, early, in, the, season, plants, are, stunted, lower, leaves, are, subjected, to, mosaic, burn, especially, during, periods, of, hot, and, dry, weather, in, these, cases, large, dead, areas, develop, in, the, leaves, this, constitutes, one, of, the, most, destructive, phases, of, tobacco, mosaic, virus, infection, infected, leaves, may, be, crinkled, puckered, or, elongated, however, if, tmv, infects, crops, like, grape, and, apple, it, is, almost, symptomless, tmv, is, able, to, infect, and, complete, its, replication, cycle, in, a, plant, pathogenic, fungus, tmv, is, able, to, enter, and, replicate, in, cells, of, c, acutatum, c, clavatum, and, c, theobromicola, which, may, not, be, an, exception, although, it, has, neither, been, found, nor, probably, searched, for, in, nature, tmv, is, one, of, the, most, stable, viruses, and, has, a, wide, survival, range, as, long, as, the, surrounding, temperature, remains, below, approximately, 40, degrees, celsius, tmv, can, sustain, its, stable, form, all, it, needs, is, a, host, to, infect, if, necessary, greenhouses, and, botanical, gardens, would, provide, the, most, favorable, condition, for, tmv, to, spread, out, due, to, the, high, population, density, of, possible, hosts, and, the, constant, temperature, throughout, the, year, it, also, could, be, useful, to, culture, tmv, in, vitro, in, sap, because, it, can, survive, up, to, 3000, days, one, of, the, common, control, methods, for, tmv, is, sanitation, which, includes, removing, infected, plants, and, washing, hands, in, between, each, planting, crop, rotation, should, also, be, employed, to, avoid, infected, soil, seed, beds, for, at, least, two, years, as, for, any, plant, disease, looking, for, resistant, strains, against, tmv, may, also, be, advised, furthermore, the, cross, protection, method, can, be, administered, where, the, stronger, strain, of, tmv, infection, is, inhibited, by, infecting, the, host, plant, with, a, mild, strain, of, tmv, similar, to, the, effect, of, a, vaccine, in, the, past, ten, years, the, application, of, genetic, engineering, on, a, host, plant, genome, has, been, developed, to, allow, the, host, plant, to, produce, the, tmv, coat, protein, within, their, cells, it, was, hypothesized, that, the, tmv, genome, will, be, re, coated, rapidly, upon, entering, the, host, cell, thus, it, prevents, the, initiation, of, tmv, replication, later, it, was, found, that, the, mechanism, that, protects, the, host, from, viral, genome, insertion, is, through, gene, silencing, tmv, is, inhibited, by, a, product, of, the, myxomycete, slime, mold, physarum, polycephalum, both, tobacco, and, the, beans, p, vulgaris, and, v, sinensis, suffered, almost, no, lesioning, in, vitro, from, tmv, when, treated, with, a, p, polycephalum, extract, research, has, shown, that, bacillus, spp, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, severity, of, symptoms, from, tmv, in, tobacco, plants, in, the, study, treated, tobacco, plants, had, more, growth, and, less, build, up, of, tmv, virions, than, tobacco, plants, that, hadn, t, been, treated, a, research, has, been, conducted, by, h, fraenkel, conrat, to, show, the, influence, of, acetic, acid, on, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, according, to, the, research, 67, acetic, acid, resulted, as, degradation, of, the, virus, another, possible, source, of, prevention, for, tmv, is, the, use, of, salicylic, acid, a, study, completed, by, a, research, team, at, the, university, of, cambridge, found, that, treating, plants, with, salicylic, acid, reduced, the, amount, of, tmv, viral, rnas, and, viral, coat, protein, present, in, the, tobacco, plants, their, research, showed, that, salicylic, acid, most, likely, was, disrupting, replication, and, transcription, and, more, specifically, the, rdrp, complex, a, research, was, conducted, and, revealed, that, humans, have, antibodies, against, tobacco, mosaic, virus, the, large, amount, of, literature, about, tmv, and, its, choice, for, many, pioneering, investigations, in, structural, biology, including, x, ray, diffraction, and, x, ray, crystallography, virus, assembly, and, disassembly, and, so, on, are, fundamentally, due, to, the, large, quantities, that, can, be, obtained, plus, the, fact, that, it, does, not, infect, animals, after, growing, several, hundred, infected, tobacco, plants, in, a, greenhouse, followed, by, a, few, simple, laboratory, procedures, a, scientist, can, produce, several, grams, of, the, virus, in, fact, tobacco, mosaic, virus, is, so, proliferate, that, the, inclusion, bodies, can, be, seen, with, only, a, light, microscope, james, d, watson, in, his, memoir, the, double, helix, cites, his, x, ray, investigation, of, tmv, s, helical, structure, as, an, important, step, in, deducing, the, nature, of, the, dna, molecule, plant, viruses, can, be, used, to, engineer, viral, vectors, tools, commonly, used, by, molecular, biologists, to, deliver, genetic, material, into, plant, cells, they, are, also, sources, of, biomaterials, and, nanotechnology, devices, viral, vectors, based, on, tmv, include, those, of, the, magnicon, and, trbo, plant, expression, technologies, due, to, its, cylindrical, shape, high, aspect, ratio, self, assembling, nature, and, ability, to, incorporate, metal, coatings, nickel, and, cobalt, into, its, shell, tmv, is, an, ideal, candidate, to, be, incorporated, into, battery, electrodes, addition, of, tmv, to, a, battery, electrode, increases, the, reactive, surface, area, by, an, order, of, magnitude, resulting, in, an, increase, in, the, battery, s, capacity, by, up, to, six, times, compared, to, a, planar, electrode, geometry, the, tmv, based, vector, also, enabled, c, acutatum, to, transiently, express, exogenous, gfp, up, to, six, subcultures, and, for, at, least, 2, mo, after, infection, without, the, need, to, develop, transformation, technology, rnai, can, be, expressed, in, the, phytopathogenic, fungus, colletotrichum, acutatum, by, vigs, using, a, recombinant, vector, based, on, tmv, in, which, the, orf, of, the, gene, encoding, the, green, fluorescent, protein, gfp, was, transcribed, in, fungal, cells, from, a, duplicate, of, the, tmv, coat, protein, cp, subgenomic, mrna, promoter, and, demonstrated, that, the, approach, could, be, used, to, obtain, foreign, protein, expression, in, fungi
