multiple, sclerosis, ms, is, an, autoimmune, disease, in, which, the, insulating, covers, of, nerve, cells, in, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, are, damaged, this, damage, disrupts, the, ability, of, parts, of, the, nervous, system, to, transmit, signals, resulting, in, a, range, of, signs, and, symptoms, including, physical, mental, and, sometimes, psychiatric, problems, symptoms, include, double, vision, vision, loss, eye, pain, muscle, weakness, and, loss, of, sensation, or, coordination, ms, takes, several, forms, with, new, symptoms, either, occurring, in, isolated, attacks, relapsing, forms, or, building, up, over, time, progressive, forms, in, relapsing, forms, of, ms, between, attacks, symptoms, may, disappear, completely, although, some, permanent, neurological, problems, often, remain, especially, as, the, disease, advances, in, progressive, forms, of, ms, bodily, function, slowly, deteriorates, once, symptoms, manifest, and, will, steadily, worsen, if, left, untreated, while, its, cause, is, unclear, the, underlying, mechanism, is, thought, to, be, either, destruction, by, the, immune, system, or, failure, of, the, myelin, producing, cells, proposed, causes, for, this, include, immune, dysregulation, genetics, and, environmental, factors, such, as, viral, infections, ms, is, usually, diagnosed, based, on, the, presenting, signs, and, symptoms, and, the, results, of, supporting, medical, tests, no, cure, for, multiple, sclerosis, is, known, current, treatments, are, aimed, at, mitigating, inflammation, and, resulting, symptoms, from, acute, flares, and, prevention, of, further, attacks, with, disease, modifying, medications, physical, therapy, and, occupational, therapy, along, with, patient, centered, symptom, management, can, help, with, people, s, ability, to, function, the, long, term, outcome, is, difficult, to, predict, better, outcomes, are, more, often, seen, in, women, those, who, develop, the, disease, early, in, life, those, with, a, relapsing, course, and, those, who, initially, experienced, few, attacks, multiple, sclerosis, is, the, most, common, immune, mediated, disorder, affecting, the, central, nervous, system, nearly, one, million, people, in, the, united, states, had, ms, in, 2022, and, in, 2020, about, 2, 8, million, people, were, affected, globally, with, rates, varying, widely, in, different, regions, and, among, different, populations, the, disease, usually, begins, between, the, ages, of, 20, and, 50, and, is, twice, as, common, in, women, as, in, men, ms, was, first, described, in, 1868, by, french, neurologist, jean, martin, charcot, the, name, multiple, sclerosis, is, short, for, multiple, cerebro, spinal, sclerosis, which, refers, to, the, numerous, glial, scars, or, sclerae, essentially, plaques, or, lesions, that, develop, on, the, white, matter, of, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, as, multiple, sclerosis, ms, lesions, can, affect, any, part, of, the, central, nervous, system, a, person, with, ms, can, have, almost, any, neurological, symptom, or, sign, referable, to, the, central, nervous, system, fatigue, is, one, of, the, most, common, symptoms, of, ms, some, 65, of, people, with, ms, experience, fatigue, symptomatology, and, of, these, some, 15, 40, report, fatigue, as, their, most, disabling, ms, symptom, autonomic, visual, motor, and, sensory, problems, are, also, among, the, most, common, symptoms, the, specific, symptoms, are, determined, by, the, locations, of, the, lesions, within, the, nervous, system, and, may, include, focal, loss, of, sensitivity, or, changes, in, sensation, in, the, limbs, such, as, feeling, tingling, pins, and, needles, or, numbness, limb, motor, weakness, pain, blurred, vision, pronounced, reflexes, muscle, spasms, difficulty, with, ambulation, walking, difficulties, with, coordination, and, balance, ataxia, problems, with, speech, or, swallowing, visual, problems, optic, neuritis, manifesting, as, eye, pain, vision, loss, or, nystagmus, manifesting, as, double, vision, fatigue, and, bladder, and, bowel, difficulties, such, as, urinary, or, fecal, incontinence, or, retention, among, others, when, multiple, sclerosis, is, more, advanced, walking, difficulties, can, occur, and, the, risk, of, falling, increases, difficulties, thinking, and, emotional, problems, such, as, depression, or, unstable, mood, are, also, common, the, primary, deficit, in, cognitive, function, that, people, with, ms, experience, is, slowed, information, processing, speed, with, memory, also, commonly, affected, and, executive, function, less, commonly, intelligence, language, and, semantic, memory, are, usually, preserved, and, the, level, of, cognitive, impairment, varies, considerably, between, people, with, ms, uhthoff, s, phenomenon, a, worsening, of, symptoms, due, to, exposure, to, higher, than, usual, temperatures, and, lhermitte, s, sign, an, electrical, sensation, that, runs, down, the, back, when, bending, the, neck, are, particularly, characteristic, of, ms, although, may, not, always, be, present, another, presenting, manifestation, that, is, rare, but, highly, suggestive, of, a, demyelinating, process, such, as, ms, is, bilateral, internuclear, ophthalmoplegia, where, the, patient, experiences, double, vision, when, attempting, to, move, their, gaze, to, the, right, left, some, 60, or, more, of, ms, patients, find, their, symptoms, particularly, including, fatigue, are, affected, by, changes, in, body, temperature, the, main, measure, of, disability, and, severity, is, the, expanded, disability, status, scale, edss, with, other, measures, such, as, the, multiple, sclerosis, functional, composite, being, increasingly, used, in, research, edss, is, also, correlated, with, falls, in, people, with, ms, while, it, is, a, popular, measure, edss, has, been, criticized, for, some, of, its, limitations, such, as, relying, too, much, on, walking, ms, may, have, a, prodromal, phase, in, the, years, leading, up, to, its, manifestation, characterized, by, psychiatric, issues, cognitive, impairment, and, increased, use, of, healthcare, the, condition, begins, in, 85, of, cases, as, a, clinically, isolated, syndrome, cis, over, a, number, of, days, with, 45, having, motor, or, sensory, problems, 20, having, optic, neuritis, and, 10, having, symptoms, related, to, brainstem, dysfunction, while, the, remaining, 25, have, more, than, one, of, the, previous, difficulties, regarding, optic, neuritis, as, the, most, common, presenting, symptom, people, with, ms, notice, sub, acute, loss, of, vision, often, associated, with, pain, worsening, on, eye, movement, and, reduced, colour, vision, early, diagnosis, of, ms, associated, optic, neuritis, helps, timely, initiation, of, targeted, treatments, however, it, is, crucial, to, adhere, to, established, diagnostic, criteria, when, treating, optic, neuritis, due, to, the, broad, range, of, alternative, causes, such, as, neuromyelitis, optica, spectrum, disorder, nmosd, and, other, autoimmune, or, infectious, conditions, the, course, of, symptoms, occurs, in, two, main, patterns, initially, either, as, episodes, of, sudden, worsening, that, last, a, few, days, to, months, called, relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or, flare, ups, followed, by, improvement, 85, of, cases, or, as, a, gradual, worsening, over, time, without, periods, of, recovery, 10, 15, of, cases, a, combination, of, these, two, patterns, may, also, occur, or, people, may, start, in, a, relapsing, and, remitting, course, that, then, becomes, progressive, later, on, relapses, are, usually, unpredictable, occurring, without, warning, exacerbations, rarely, occur, more, frequently, than, twice, per, year, some, relapses, however, are, preceded, by, common, triggers, and, they, occur, more, frequently, during, spring, and, summer, similarly, viral, infections, such, as, the, common, cold, influenza, or, gastroenteritis, increase, their, risk, stress, may, also, trigger, an, attack, many, events, have, been, found, not, to, affect, rates, of, relapse, requiring, hospitalization, including, vaccination, breast, feeding, physical, trauma, and, uhthoff, s, phenomenon, many, women, with, ms, who, become, pregnant, experience, lower, symptoms, and, fewer, relapses, during, the, first, months, after, delivery, the, risk, increases, overall, pregnancy, does, not, seem, to, influence, long, term, disability, multiple, sclerosis, is, an, autoimmune, disease, with, a, combination, of, genetic, and, environmental, causes, underlying, it, both, t, cells, and, b, cells, are, involved, although, t, cells, are, often, considered, to, be, the, driving, force, of, the, disease, the, causes, of, the, disease, are, not, fully, understood, the, epstein, barr, virus, ebv, has, been, shown, to, be, directly, present, in, the, brain, of, most, cases, of, ms, and, the, virus, is, transcriptionally, active, in, infected, cells, ebv, nuclear, antigens, are, believed, to, be, involved, in, the, pathogenesis, of, multiple, sclerosis, but, not, all, people, with, ms, have, signs, of, ebv, infection, dozens, of, human, peptides, have, been, identified, in, different, cases, of, the, disease, and, while, some, have, plausible, links, to, infectious, organisms, or, known, environmental, factors, others, do, not, failure, of, both, central, and, peripheral, nervous, system, clearance, of, autoreactive, immune, cells, is, implicated, in, the, development, of, ms, the, thymus, is, responsible, for, the, immune, system, s, central, tolerance, where, autoreactive, t, cells, are, killed, without, being, released, into, circulation, via, a, similar, mechanism, autoreactive, b, cells, in, the, bone, marrow, are, killed, some, autoreactive, t, cells, b, cells, may, escape, these, defense, mechanisms, which, is, where, peripheral, immune, tolerance, defenses, take, action, by, preventing, them, from, causing, disease, however, these, additional, lines, of, defense, can, still, fail, further, detail, on, immune, dysregulation, s, contribution, to, ms, risk, is, provided, in, the, pathophysiology, section, of, this, article, as, well, as, the, standalone, article, on, the, pathophysiology, of, ms, early, evidence, suggested, the, association, between, several, viruses, with, human, demyelinating, encephalomyelitis, and, the, occurrence, of, demyelination, in, animals, caused, by, some, viral, infections, one, such, virus, epstein, barr, virus, ebv, can, cause, infectious, mononucleosis, and, infects, about, 95, of, adults, though, only, a, small, proportion, of, those, infected, later, develop, ms, a, study, of, more, than, 10, million, us, military, members, compared, 801, people, who, developed, ms, to, 1, 566, matched, controls, who, did, not, develop, ms, the, study, found, a, 32, fold, increased, risk, of, developing, ms, after, infection, with, ebv, it, did, not, find, an, increased, risk, after, infection, with, other, viruses, including, the, similar, cytomegalovirus, these, findings, strongly, suggest, that, ebv, plays, a, role, in, ms, onset, although, ebv, alone, may, be, insufficient, to, cause, it, the, nuclear, antigen, of, ebv, which, is, the, most, consistent, marker, of, ebv, infection, across, all, strains, has, been, identified, as, a, direct, source, of, autoreactivity, in, the, human, body, these, antigens, appear, to, be, more, likely, to, promote, autoimmune, responses, in, a, person, who, also, has, a, vitamin, d, deficiency, the, exact, nature, of, this, relationship, is, poorly, understood, ms, is, not, considered, a, hereditary, disease, but, several, genetic, variations, have, been, shown, to, increase, its, risk, some, of, these, genes, appear, to, have, higher, expression, levels, in, microglial, cells, than, expected, by, chance, the, probability, of, developing, ms, is, higher, in, relatives, of, an, affected, person, with, a, greater, risk, among, those, more, closely, related, an, identical, twin, of, an, affected, individual, has, a, 30, chance, of, developing, ms, 5, for, a, nonidentical, twin, 2, 5, for, a, sibling, and, an, even, lower, chance, for, a, half, sibling, if, both, parents, are, affected, the, risk, in, their, children, is, 10, times, that, of, the, general, population, ms, is, also, more, common, in, some, ethnic, groups, than, others, specific, genes, that, have, been, linked, with, ms, include, differences, in, the, human, leukocyte, antigen, hla, system, a, group, of, genes, on, chromosome, 6, that, serves, as, the, major, histocompatibility, complex, mhc, the, contribution, of, hla, variants, to, ms, susceptibility, has, been, known, since, the, 1980s, and, this, same, region, has, also, been, implicated, in, the, development, of, other, autoimmune, diseases, such, as, type, 1, diabetes, and, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, the, most, consistent, finding, is, the, association, between, higher, risk, of, developing, multiple, sclerosis, and, the, mhc, allele, dr15, which, is, present, in, 30, of, the, u, s, and, northern, european, population, other, loci, exhibit, a, protective, effect, such, as, hla, c554, and, hla, drb1, 11, hla, differences, account, for, an, estimated, 20, to, 60, of, the, genetic, predisposition, genome, wide, association, studies, have, revealed, at, least, 200, variants, outside, the, hla, locus, that, affect, the, risk, of, ms, the, prevalence, of, ms, from, a, geographic, standpoint, resembles, a, gradient, with, ms, being, more, common, in, people, who, live, farther, from, the, equator, e, g, those, who, live, in, northern, regions, of, the, world, although, exceptions, exist, the, cause, of, this, geographical, pattern, is, not, clear, although, exposure, to, ultraviolet, b, uvb, radiation, and, vitamin, d, levels, have, been, proposed, as, potential, explanations, as, such, those, who, live, in, northern, regions, of, the, world, are, thought, to, have, less, exposure, to, uvb, radiation, and, subsequently, lower, levels, of, vitamin, d, which, is, a, known, risk, factor, for, developing, ms, inversely, those, who, live, in, areas, of, relatively, higher, sun, exposure, and, subsequently, increased, uvb, radiation, have, a, decreased, risk, of, developing, ms, while, the, north, south, gradient, of, incidence, is, decreasing, as, of, 2010, it, is, still, present, ms, is, more, common, in, regions, with, northern, european, populations, so, the, geographic, variation, may, simply, reflect, the, global, distribution, of, these, high, risk, populations, a, relationship, between, season, of, birth, and, ms, lends, support, to, this, idea, with, fewer, people, born, in, the, northern, hemisphere, in, november, compared, to, may, being, affected, later, in, life, environmental, factors, may, play, a, role, during, childhood, with, several, studies, finding, that, people, who, move, to, a, different, region, of, the, world, before, the, age, of, 15, acquire, the, new, region, s, risk, of, ms, if, migration, takes, place, after, age, 15, the, persons, retain, the, risk, of, their, home, country, some, evidence, indicates, that, the, effect, of, moving, may, still, apply, to, people, older, than, 15, there, are, some, exceptions, to, the, above, mentioned, geographic, pattern, these, include, ethnic, groups, that, are, at, low, risk, and, that, live, far, from, the, equator, such, as, the, sami, amerindians, canadian, hutterites, new, zealand, m, ori, and, canada, s, inuit, as, well, as, groups, that, have, a, relatively, high, risk, and, that, live, closer, to, the, equator, such, as, sardinians, inland, sicilians, palestinians, and, parsi, ms, symptoms, may, increase, if, body, temperature, is, dysregulated, fatigue, is, particularly, effected, smoking, may, be, an, independent, risk, factor, for, ms, stress, may, also, be, a, risk, factor, although, the, evidence, to, support, this, is, weak, association, with, occupational, exposures, and, toxins, mainly, organic, solvents, has, been, evaluated, but, no, clear, conclusions, have, been, reached, vaccinations, were, studied, as, causal, factors, most, studies, though, show, no, association, several, other, possible, risk, factors, such, as, diet, and, hormone, intake, have, been, evaluated, but, evidence, on, their, relation, with, the, disease, is, sparse, and, unpersuasive, gout, occurs, less, than, would, be, expected, and, lower, levels, of, uric, acid, have, been, found, in, people, with, ms, this, has, led, to, the, theory, that, uric, acid, is, protective, although, its, exact, importance, remains, unknown, obesity, during, adolescence, and, young, adulthood, is, a, risk, factor, for, ms, multiple, sclerosis, is, an, autoimmune, disease, primarily, mediated, by, t, cells, the, three, main, characteristics, of, ms, are, the, formation, of, lesions, in, the, central, nervous, system, also, called, plaques, inflammation, and, the, destruction, of, myelin, sheaths, of, neurons, these, features, interact, in, a, complex, and, not, yet, fully, understood, manner, to, produce, the, breakdown, of, nerve, tissue, and, in, turn, the, signs, and, symptoms, of, the, disease, damage, is, believed, to, be, caused, at, least, in, part, by, attack, on, the, nervous, system, by, a, person, s, own, immune, system, as, briefly, detailed, in, the, causes, section, of, this, article, ms, is, currently, thought, to, stem, from, a, failure, of, the, body, s, immune, system, to, kill, off, autoreactive, t, cells, b, cells, currently, the, t, cell, subpopulations, that, are, thought, to, drive, the, development, of, ms, are, autoreactive, cd8, t, cells, cd4, helper, t, cells, and, t, h, 17, cells, these, autoreactive, t, cells, produce, substances, called, cytokines, that, induce, an, inflammatory, immune, response, in, the, cns, leading, to, the, development, of, the, disease, more, recently, however, the, role, of, autoreactive, b, cells, has, been, elucidated, evidence, of, their, contribution, to, the, development, of, ms, is, implicated, through, the, presence, of, oligoclonal, igg, bands, antibodies, produced, by, b, cells, in, the, csf, of, patients, with, ms, the, presence, of, these, oligoclonal, bands, has, been, used, as, supportive, evidence, in, clinching, a, diagnosis, of, ms, as, similarly, described, before, b, cells, can, also, produce, cytokines, that, induce, an, inflammatory, immune, response, via, activation, of, autoreactive, t, cells, as, such, higher, levels, of, these, autoreactive, b, cells, is, associated, with, increased, number, of, lesions, neurodegeneration, as, well, as, worse, disability, another, cell, population, that, is, becoming, increasingly, implicated, in, ms, are, microglia, these, cells, are, resident, to, keep, watch, over, the, cns, responding, to, pathogens, by, shifting, between, pro, anti, inflammatory, states, microglia, have, been, shown, to, be, involved, in, the, formation, of, ms, lesions, and, have, been, shown, to, be, involved, in, other, diseases, that, primarily, affect, the, cns, white, matter, although, because, of, their, ability, to, switch, between, pro, anti, inflammatory, states, microglia, have, also, been, shown, to, be, able, to, assist, in, remyelination, subsequent, neuron, repair, as, such, microglia, are, thought, to, be, participating, in, both, acute, chronic, ms, lesions, with, 40, of, phagocytic, cells, in, early, active, ms, lesions, being, proinflammatory, microglia, the, name, multiple, sclerosis, refers, to, the, scars, sclerae, better, known, as, plaques, or, lesions, that, form, in, the, nervous, system, these, lesions, most, commonly, affect, the, white, matter, in, the, optic, nerve, brain, stem, basal, ganglia, and, spinal, cord, or, white, matter, tracts, close, to, the, lateral, ventricles, the, function, of, white, matter, cells, is, to, carry, signals, between, grey, matter, areas, where, the, processing, is, done, and, the, rest, of, the, body, the, peripheral, nervous, system, is, rarely, involved, to, be, specific, ms, involves, the, loss, of, oligodendrocytes, the, cells, responsible, for, creating, and, maintaining, a, fatty, layer, known, as, the, myelin, sheath, which, helps, the, neurons, carry, electrical, signals, action, potentials, this, results, in, a, thinning, or, complete, loss, of, myelin, and, as, the, disease, advances, the, breakdown, of, the, axons, of, neurons, when, the, myelin, is, lost, a, neuron, can, no, longer, effectively, conduct, electrical, signals, a, repair, process, called, remyelination, takes, place, in, early, phases, of, the, disease, but, the, oligodendrocytes, are, unable, to, completely, rebuild, the, cell, s, myelin, sheath, repeated, attacks, lead, to, successively, less, effective, remyelinations, until, a, scar, like, plaque, is, built, up, around, the, damaged, axons, these, scars, are, the, origin, of, the, symptoms, and, during, an, attack, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, often, shows, more, than, 10, new, plaques, this, could, indicate, that, some, number, of, lesions, exist, below, which, the, brain, is, capable, of, repairing, itself, without, producing, noticeable, consequences, another, process, involved, in, the, creation, of, lesions, is, an, abnormal, increase, in, the, number, of, astrocytes, due, to, the, destruction, of, nearby, neurons, a, number, of, lesion, patterns, have, been, described, apart, from, demyelination, the, other, sign, of, the, disease, is, inflammation, fitting, with, an, immunological, explanation, the, inflammatory, process, is, caused, by, t, cells, a, kind, of, lymphocytes, that, plays, an, important, role, in, the, body, s, defenses, t, cells, gain, entry, into, the, brain, as, a, result, of, disruptions, in, the, blood, brain, barrier, the, t, cells, recognize, myelin, as, foreign, and, attack, it, explaining, why, these, cells, are, also, called, autoreactive, lymphocytes, the, attack, on, myelin, starts, inflammatory, processes, which, trigger, other, immune, cells, and, the, release, of, soluble, factors, like, cytokines, and, antibodies, a, further, breakdown, of, the, blood, brain, barrier, in, turn, causes, a, number, of, other, damaging, effects, such, as, swelling, activation, of, macrophages, and, more, activation, of, cytokines, and, other, destructive, proteins, inflammation, can, potentially, reduce, transmission, of, information, between, neurons, in, at, least, three, ways, the, soluble, factors, released, might, stop, neurotransmission, by, intact, neurons, these, factors, could, lead, to, or, enhance, the, loss, of, myelin, or, they, may, cause, the, axon, to, break, down, completely, the, blood, brain, barrier, bbb, is, a, part, of, the, capillary, system, that, prevents, the, entry, of, t, cells, into, the, central, nervous, system, it, may, become, permeable, to, these, types, of, cells, secondary, to, an, infection, by, a, virus, or, bacteria, after, it, repairs, itself, typically, once, the, infection, has, cleared, t, cells, may, remain, trapped, inside, the, brain, gadolinium, cannot, cross, a, normal, bbb, so, gadolinium, enhanced, mri, is, used, to, show, bbb, breakdowns, the, pathophysiology, and, mechanisms, causing, ms, fatigue, are, not, well, understood, ms, fatigue, can, be, affected, by, body, heat, and, this, may, differentiate, ms, fatigue, from, other, primary, fatigue, fatigability, loss, of, strength, may, increase, perception, of, fatigue, but, the, two, measures, warrant, independent, assessment, in, clinical, studies, multiple, sclerosis, is, typically, diagnosed, based, on, the, presenting, signs, and, symptoms, in, combination, with, supporting, medical, imaging, and, laboratory, testing, it, can, be, difficult, to, confirm, especially, early, on, since, the, signs, and, symptoms, may, be, similar, to, those, of, other, medical, problems, the, mcdonald, criteria, which, focus, on, clinical, laboratory, and, radiologic, evidence, of, lesions, at, different, times, and, in, different, areas, is, the, most, commonly, used, method, of, diagnosis, with, the, schumacher, and, poser, criteria, being, of, mostly, historical, significance, the, mcdonald, criteria, states, that, patients, with, multiple, sclerosis, should, have, lesions, which, are, disseminated, in, time, dit, and, disseminated, in, space, dis, i, e, lesions, which, have, appeared, in, different, areas, in, the, brain, and, at, different, times, below, is, an, abbreviated, outline, of, the, 2017, mcdonald, criteria, for, diagnosis, of, ms, as, of, 2017, no, single, test, including, biopsy, can, provide, a, definitive, diagnosis, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, of, the, brain, and, spine, may, show, areas, of, demyelination, lesions, or, plaques, gadolinium, can, be, administered, intravenously, as, a, contrast, agent, to, highlight, active, plaques, and, by, elimination, demonstrate, the, existence, of, historical, lesions, not, associated, with, symptoms, at, the, moment, of, the, evaluation, central, vein, signs, cvss, have, been, proposed, as, a, good, indicator, of, ms, in, comparison, with, other, conditions, causing, white, lesions, one, small, study, found, fewer, cvss, in, older, and, hypertensive, people, further, research, on, cvs, as, a, biomarker, for, ms, is, ongoing, testing, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, obtained, from, a, lumbar, puncture, can, provide, evidence, of, chronic, inflammation, in, the, central, nervous, system, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, is, tested, for, oligoclonal, bands, of, igg, on, electrophoresis, which, are, inflammation, markers, found, in, 75, 85, of, people, with, ms, several, diseases, present, similarly, to, ms, medical, professionals, use, a, patient, s, specific, presentation, history, and, exam, findings, to, make, an, individualized, differential, red, flags, are, findings, that, suggest, an, alternate, diagnosis, although, they, do, not, rule, out, ms, red, flags, include, a, patient, younger, than, 15, or, older, than, 60, less, than, 24, hours, of, symptoms, involvement, of, multiple, cranial, nerves, involvement, of, organs, outside, of, the, nervous, system, and, atypical, lab, and, exam, findings, in, an, emergency, setting, it, is, important, to, rule, out, a, stroke, or, bleeding, in, the, brain, intractable, vomiting, severe, optic, neuritis, or, bilateral, optic, neuritis, raises, suspicion, for, neuromyelitis, optica, spectrum, disorder, nmosd, infectious, diseases, that, may, look, similar, to, multiple, sclerosis, include, hiv, lyme,

to, predict, the, future, course, they, are, important, not, only, for, prognosis, but, also, for, treatment, decisions, the, international, advisory, committee, on, clinical, trials, of, ms, describes, four, types, of, ms, revised, in, 2013, in, what, is, known, as, the, lublin, classification, cis, can, be, characterised, as, a, single, lesion, seen, on, mri, which, is, associated, with, signs, or, symptoms, found, in, ms, due, to, the, mcdonald, criteria, it, does, not, completely, fit, the, criteria, to, be, diagnosed, as, ms, hence, being, named, clinically, isolated, syndrome, cis, can, be, seen, as, the, first, episode, of, demyelination, in, the, central, nervous, system, to, be, classified, as, cis, the, attack, must, last, at, least, 24, hours, and, be, caused, by, inflammation, or, demyelination, of, the, central, nervous, system, patients, who, suffer, from, cis, may, or, may, not, go, on, to, develop, ms, but, 30, to, 70, of, persons, who, experience, cis, will, later, develop, ms, rrms, is, characterized, by, unpredictable, relapses, followed, by, periods, of, months, to, years, of, relative, quiet, remission, with, no, new, signs, of, disease, activity, deficits, that, occur, during, attacks, may, either, resolve, or, leave, problems, the, latter, in, about, 40, of, attacks, and, being, more, common, the, longer, a, person, has, had, the, disease, this, describes, the, initial, course, of, 80, of, individuals, with, ms, ppms, occurs, in, roughly, 10, 20, of, individuals, with, the, disease, with, no, remission, after, the, initial,

studies, investigating, information, provision, in, support, of, patient, understanding, and, participation, suggest, that, while, interventions, written, information, decision, aids, coaching,

given, small, sample, numbers, variable, methodology, interventions, and, outcome, measures, the, effectiveness, of, palliative, approaches, in, addition, to, standard, care, is, uncertain, due, to, lack, of, evidence, the, effectiveness, of, interventions, including, exercise, specifically, for, the, prevention, of, falls, in, people, with, ms, is, uncertain, while, there, is, some, evidence, of, an, effect, on, balance, function, and, mobility, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, has, shown, to, be, moderately, effective, for, reducing, ms, fatigue, the, evidence, for, the, effectiveness, of, non, pharmacological, interventions, for, chronic, pain, is, insufficient, to, recommend, such, interventions, alone, however, their, use, in, combination, with, medications, may, be, reasonable, there, is, some, evidence, that, aquatic, therapy, is, a, beneficial, intervention, the, spasticity, associated, with, ms, can, be, difficult, to, manage, because, of, the, progressive, and, fluctuating, course, of, the, disease, although, there, is, no, firm, conclusion, on, the, efficacy, in, reducing, spasticity, pt, interventions, can, be, a, safe, and, beneficial, option, for,

improved, prognosis, these, treatments, can, reduce, relapses, and, slow, progression, but, there, is, no, cure, the, prognosis, of, ms, depends, on, the, subtype, of, the, disease, and, there, is, considerable, individual, variation, in, the, progression, of, the, disease, in, relapsing, ms, the, most, common, subtype, a, 2016, cohort, study, found, that, after, a, median, of, 16, 8, years, from, onset, one, in, ten, needed, a, walking, aid, and, almost, two, in, ten, transitioned, to, secondary, progressive, ms, a, form, characterized, by, more, progressive, decline, with, treatments, available, in, the, 2020s, relapses, can, be, eliminated, or, substantially, reduced, however, silent, progression, of, the, disease, still, occurs, in, addition, to, secondary, progressive, ms, spms, a, small, proportion, of, people, with, ms, 10, 15, experience, progressive, decline, from, the, onset, known, as, primary, progressive, ms, ppms, most, treatments, have, been, approved, for, use, in, relapsing, ms, there, are, fewer, treatments, with, lower, efficacy, for, progressive, forms, of, ms, the, prognosis, for, progressive, ms, is, worse, with, faster, accumulation, of, disability, though, with, considerable, individual, variation, in, untreated, ppms, the, median, time, from, onset, to, requiring, a, walking, aid, is, estimated, as, seven, years, in, spms, a, 2014, cohort, study, reported, that, people, required, a, walking, aid, after, an, average, of, five, years, from, onset, of, spms, and, were, chair, or, bed, bound, after, an, average, of, fifteen, years, after,

relapse, rate, currently, no, biomarker, can, accurately, predict, disease, progression, in, every, patient, spinal, cord, lesions, abnormalities, on, mri, and, more, brain, atrophy, are, predictive, of, a, worse, course, though, brain, atrophy, as, a, predictor, of, disease, course, is, experimental, and, not, used, in, clinical, practice, early, treatment, leads, to, a, better, prognosis, but, a, higher, relapse, frequency, when, treated, with, dmts, is, associated, with, a, poorer, prognosis, a, 60, year, longitudinal, population, study, conducted, in, norway, found, that, those, with, ms, had, a, life, expectancy, seven, years, shorter, than, the, general, population, median, life, expectancy, for, rrms, patients, was, 77, 8, years, and, 71, 4, years, for, ppms, compared, to, 81, 8, years, for, the, general, population, life, expectancy, for, men, was, five, years, shorter, than, for, women, ms, is, the, most, common, autoimmune, disorder, of, the, central, nervous, system, the, latest, estimation, of, the, total, number, of, people, with, ms, was, 2, 8, million, globally, with, a, prevalence, of, 36, per, 100, 000, people, moreover, prevalence, varies, widely, in, different, regions, around, the, world, in, africa, there, are, five, people, per, 100, 000, diagnosed, with, ms, compared, to, south, east, asia, where, the, prevalence, is, nine, per, 100, 000, 112, per, 100, 000, in, the, americas, and, 133, per, 100, 000, in, europe, increasing, rates, of, ms, may, be, explained, simply, by, better, diagnosis, studies, on, populational, and, geographical, patterns, have, been, common, and, have, led, to, a, number, of, theories, about, the, cause, ms, usually, appears, in, adults, in, their, late, twenties, or, early, thirties, but, it, can, rarely, start, in, childhood, and, after, 50, years, of, age, the, primary, progressive, subtype, is, more, common, in, people, in, their, fifties, similarly, to, many, autoimmune, disorders, the, disease, is, more, common, in, women, and, the, trend, may, be, increasing, as, of, 2020, globally, it, is, about, two, times, more, common, in, women, than, in, men, and, the, ratio, of, women, to, men, with, ms, is, as, high, as, 4, 1, in, some, countries, in, children, it, is, even, more, common, in, females, than, males, while, in, people, over, fifty, it, affects, males, and, females, almost, equally, robert, carswell, 1793, 1857, a, british, professor, of, pathology, and, jean, cruveilhier, 1791, 1873, a, french, professor, of, pathologic, anatomy, described, and, illustrated, many, of, the, disease, s, clinical, details, but, did, not, identify, it, as, a, separate, disease, specifically, carswell, described, the, injuries, he, found, as, a, remarkable, lesion, of, the, spinal, cord, accompanied, with, atrophy, under, the, microscope, swiss, pathologist, georg, eduard, rindfleisch, 1836, 1908, noted, in, 1863, that, the, inflammation, associated, lesions, were, distributed, around, blood, vessels, the, french, neurologist, jean, martin, charcot, 1825, 1893, was, the, first, person, to, recognize, multiple, sclerosis, as, a, distinct, disease, in, 1868, summarizing, previous, reports, and, adding, his, own, clinical, and, pathological, observations, charcot, called, the, disease, sclerose, en, plaques, the, first, attempt, to, establish, a, set, of, diagnostic, criteria, was, also, due, to, charcot, in, 1868, he, published, what, now, is, known, as, the, charcot, triad, consisting, in, nystagmus, intention, tremor, and, telegraphic, speech, scanning, speech, charcot, also, observed, cognition, changes, describing, his, patients, as, having, a, marked, enfeeblement, of, the, memory, and, conceptions, that, formed, slowly, diagnosis, was, based, on, charcot, triad, and, clinical, observation, until, schumacher, made, the, first, attempt, to, standardize, criteria, in, 1965, by, introducing, some, fundamental, requirements, dissemination, of, the, lesions, in, time, dit, and, space, dis, and, that, signs, and, symptoms, cannot, be, explained, better, by, another, disease, process, the, dit, and, dis, requirement, was, later, inherited, by, the, poser, and, mcdonald, criteria, whose, 2017, revision, is, in, use, during, the, 20th, century, theories, about, the, cause, and, pathogenesis, were, developed, and, effective, treatments, began, to, appear, in, the, 1990s, since, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, refinements, of, the, concepts, have, taken, place, the, 2010, revision, of, the, mcdonald, criteria, allowed, for, the, diagnosis, of, ms, with, only, one, proved, lesion, cis, in, 1996, the, us, national, multiple, sclerosis, society, nmss, advisory, committee, on, clinical, trials, defined, the, first, version, of, the, clinical, phenotypes, that, is, in, use, in, this, first, version, they, provided, standardized, definitions, for, four, ms, clinical, courses, relapsing, remitting, rr, secondary, progressive, sp, primary, progressive, pp, and, progressive, relapsing, pr, in, 2010, pr, was, dropped, and, cis, was, incorporated, three, years, later, the, 2013, revision, of, the, phenotypes, for, the, disease, course, were, forced, to, consider, cis, as, one, of, the, phenotypes, of, ms, making, obsolete, some, expressions, like, conversion, from, cis, to, ms, other, organizations, have, proposed, later, new, clinical, phenotypes, like, hams, highly, active, ms, there, are, several, historical, accounts, of, people, who, probably, had, ms, and, lived, before, or, shortly, after, the, disease, was, described, by, charcot, a, young, woman, called, halldora, who, lived, in, iceland, around, 1200, suddenly, lost, her, vision, and, mobility, but, recovered, them, seven, days, after, saint, lidwina, of, schiedam, 1380, 1433, a, dutch, nun, may, be, one, of, the, first, clearly, identifiable, people, with, ms, from, the, age, of, 16, until, her, death, at, 53, she, had, intermittent, pain, weakness, of, the, legs, and, vision, loss, symptoms, typical, of, ms, both, cases, have, led, to, the, proposal, of, a, viking, gene, hypothesis, for, the, dissemination, of, the, disease, augustus, frederick, d, este, 1794, 1848, son, of, prince, augustus, frederick, duke, of, sussex, and, lady, augusta, murray, and, a, grandson, of, george, iii, of, the, united, kingdom, almost, certainly, had, ms, d, este, left, a, detailed, diary, describing, his, 22, years, living, with, the, disease, his, diary, began, in, 1822, and, ended, in, 1846, although, it, remained, unknown, until, 1948, his, symptoms, began, at, age, 28, with, a, sudden, transient, visual, loss, amaurosis, fugax, after, the, funeral, of, a, friend, during, his, disease, he, developed, weakness, of, the, legs, clumsiness, of, the, hands, numbness, dizziness, bladder, disturbance, and, erectile, dysfunction, in, 1844, he, began, to, use, a, wheelchair, despite, his, illness, he, kept, an, optimistic, view, of, life, another, early, account, of, ms, was, kept, by, the, british, diarist, w, n, p, barbellion, pen, name, of, bruce, frederick, cummings, 1889, 1919, who, maintained, a, detailed, log, of, his, diagnosis, and, struggle, his, diary, was, published, in, 1919, as, the, journal, of, a, disappointed, man, charles, dickens, a, keen, observer, described, possible, bilateral, optic, neuritis, with, reduced, contrast, vision, and, uhthoff, phenomenon, in, the, main, female, character, of, bleak, house, 1852, 1853, esther, summerville, as, of, 2022, the, pathogenesis, of, ms, as, it, relates, to, epstein, barr, virus, ebv, is, actively, investigated, as, are, disease, modifying, therapies, understanding, of, how, risk, factors, combine, with, ebv, to, initiate, ms, is, sought, whether, ebv, is, the, only, cause, of, ms, might, be, better, understood, if, an, ebv, vaccine, is, developed, and, shown, to, prevent, ms, as, well, even, though, a, variety, of, studies, showed, the, connection, between, an, ebv, infection, and, a, later, development, of, multiple, sclerosis, the, mechanisms, behind, this, correlation, are, not, completely, clear, and, several, theories, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, relationship, between, the, two, diseases, it, is, thought, that, the, involvement, of, ebv, infected, b, cells, b, lymphocytes, and, the, involvement, of, anti, ebna, antibodies, which, appear, to, be, significantly, higher, in, multiple, sclerosis, patients, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, development, of, the, disease, this, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, treatment, against, b, cells, e, g, ocrelizumab, reduces, the, symptoms, of, multiple, sclerosis, annual, relapses, appear, less, frequently, and, the, disability, progression, is, slower, a, 2022, stanford, university, study, has, shown, that, during, an, ebv, infection, molecular, mimicry, can, occur, where, the, immune, system, will, produce, antibodies, against, the, ebna, 1, protein, which, at, the, same, time, is, able, to, bind, to, glialcam, in, the, myelin, additionally, they, observed, a, phenomenon, which, is, uncommon, in, healthy, individuals, but, often, detected, in, multiple, sclerosis, patients, b, cells, are, trafficking, to, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, where, they, are, producing, oligoclonal, antibody, bands, a, majority, of, these, oligoclonal, bands, do, have, an, affinity, to, the, viral, protein, ebna1, which, is, cross, reactive, to, glialcam, these, antibodies, are, abundant, in, approximately, 20, 25, of, multiple, sclerosis, patients, and, worsen, the, autoimmune, demyelination, which, leads, consequently, to, an, pathophysiological, exacerbation, of, the, disease, furthermore, the, intrathecal, oligoclonal, expansion, with, a, constant, somatic, hypermutation, is, unique, in, multiple, sclerosis, when, compared, to, other, neuroinflammatory, diseases, in, the, study, there, was, also, the, abundance, of, antibodies, with, ighv, 3, 7, genes, measured, which, appears, to, be, connected, to, the, disease, progress, antibodies, which, are, ighv3, 7, based, are, binding, with, a, high, affinity, to, ebna1, and, glialcam, this, process, is, actively, thriving, the, demyelination, it, is, probable, that, b, cells, expressing, ighv, 3, 7, genes, entered, the, csf, and, underwent, affinity, maturation, after, facing, glialcam, which, led, consequently, to, the, production, of, high, affinity, anti, glialcam, antibodies, this, was, additionally, shown, in, the, eae, mouse, model, where, immunization, with, ebna1, lead, to, a, strong, b, cell, response, against, glialcam, which, worsened, the, eae, two, members, of, the, human, endogenous, retroviruses, w, herv, w, family, namely, ervwe1, and, ms, associated, retrovirus, msrv, may, be, co, factors, in, ms, immunopathogenesis, hervs, constitute, up, to, 8, of, the, human, genome, most, are, epigenetically, silent, but, can, be, reactivated, by, exogenous, viruses, proinflammatory, conditions, or, oxidative, stress, medications, that, influence, voltage, gated, sodium, ion, channels, are, under, investigation, as, a, potential, neuroprotective, strategy, because, of, hypothesized, role, of, sodium, in, the, pathological, process, leading, to, axonal, injury, and, accumulating, disability, there, is, insufficient, evidence, of, an, effect, of, sodium, channel, blockers, for, people, with, ms, ms, is, a, clinically, defined, entity, with, several, atypical, presentations, some, auto, antibodies, have, been, found, in, atypical, ms, cases, giving, birth, to, separate, disease, families, and, restricting, the, previously, wider, concept, of, ms, anti, aqp4, autoantibodies, were, found, in, neuromyelitis, optica, nmo, which, was, previously, considered, a, ms, variant, a, spectrum, of, diseases, named, nmosd, nmo, spectrum, diseases, or, anti, aqp4, diseases, has, been, accepted, some, cases, of, ms, were, presenting, anti, mog, autoantibodies, mainly, overlapping, with, the, marburg, variant, anti, mog, autoantibodies, were, found, to, be, also, present, in, adem, and, a, second, spectrum, of, separated, diseases, is, being, considered, this, spectrum, is, named, inconsistently, across, different, authors, but, it, is, normally, something, similar, to, anti, mog, demyelinating, diseases, a, third, kind, of, auto, antibodies, is, accepted, they, are, several, anti, neurofascin, auto, antibodies, which, damage, the, ranvier, nodes, of, the, neurons, these, antibodies, are, more, related, to, the, peripheral, nervous, demyelination, but, they, were, also, found, in, chronic, progressive, ppms, and, combined, central, and, peripheral, demyelination, ccpd, which, is, considered, another, atypical, ms, presentation, in, addition, to, the, significance, of, auto, antibodies, in, ms, four, different, patterns, of, demyelination, have, been, reported, opening, the, door, to, consider, ms, as, a, heterogeneous, disease, since, disease, progression, is, the, result, of, degeneration, of, neurons, the, roles, of, proteins, showing, loss, of, nerve, tissue, such, as, neurofilaments, tau, and, n, acetylaspartate, are, under, investigation, improvement, in, neuroimaging, techniques, such, as, positron, emission, tomography, pet, or, mri, carry, a, promise, for, better, diagnosis, and, prognosis, predictions, regarding, mri, there, are, several, techniques, that, have, already, shown, some, usefulness, in, research, settings, and, could, be, introduced, into, clinical, practice, such, as, double, inversion, recovery, sequences, magnetization, transfer, diffusion, tensor, and, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, these, techniques, are, more, specific, for, the, disease, than, existing, ones, but, still, lack, some, standardization, of, acquisition, protocols, and, the, creation, of, normative, values, this, is, particularly, the, case, for, proton, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, for, which, a, number, of, methodological, variations, observed, in, the, literature, may, underlie, continued, inconsistencies, in, central, nervous, system, metabolic, abnormalities, particularly, in, n, acetyl, aspartate, myoinositol, choline, glutamate, gaba, and, gsh, observed, for, multiple, sclerosis, and, its, subtypes, there, are, other, techniques, under, development, that, include, contrast, agents, capable, of, measuring, levels, of, peripheral, macrophages, inflammation, or, neuronal, dysfunction, and, techniques, that, measure, iron, deposition, that, could, serve, to, determine, the, role, of, this, feature, in, ms, or, that, of, cerebral, perfusion, the, hospitalization, rate, was, found, to, be, higher, among, individuals, with, ms, and, covid, 19, infection, at, 10, while, the, pooled, infection, rate, is, estimated, at, 4, the, pooled, prevalence, of, death, in, hospitalized, individuals, with, ms, is, estimated, as, 4, a, 2019, study, on, rats, and, a, 2024, study, on, mice, showed, that, a, first, line, medication, for, the, treatment, of, type, 2, diabetes, metformin, could, promote, remyelination, the, promising, drug, is, currently, being, researched, on, humans, in, the, octopus, trials, a, multi, arm, multi, stage, trial, focussed, on, testing, existing, drugs, for, other, conditions, on, patients, with, ms, currently, clinical, trials, on, humans, are, ongoing, in, belgium, for, patients, with, non, active, progressive, ms, in, the, u, k, in, combination, with, clemastine, for, the, treatment, of, relapsing, remitting, ms, and, canada, for, ms, patients, up, to, 25, years, old, one, emerging, hypothesis, referred, to, as, the, hygiene, hypothesis, suggests, that, early, life, exposure, to, infectious, agents, helps, to, develop, the, immune, system, and, reduces, susceptibility, to, allergies, and, autoimmune, disorders, the, hygiene, hypothesis, has, been, linked, with, ms, and, microbiome, hypotheses, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, certain, bacteria, found, in, the, gut, use, molecular, mimicry, to, infiltrate, the, brain, via, the, gut, brain, axis, initiating, an, inflammatory, response, and, increasing, blood, brain, barrier, permeability, vitamin, d, levels, have, also, been, correlated, with, ms, lower, levels, of, vitamin, d, correspond, to, an, increased, risk, of, ms, suggesting, a, reduced, prevalence, in, the, tropics, an, area, with, more, vitamin, d, rich, sunlight, strengthening, the, impact, of, geographical, location, on, ms, development, ms, mechanisms, begin, when, peripheral, autoreactive, effector, cd4, t, cells, get, activated, and, move, into, the, cns, antigen, presenting, cells, localize, the, reactivation, of, autoreactive, effector, cd4, t, cells, once, they, have, entered, the, cns, attracting, more, t, cells, and, macrophages, to, form, the, inflammatory, lesion, in, ms, patients, macrophages, and, microglia, assemble, at, locations, where, demyelination, and, neurodegeneration, are, actively, occurring, and, microglial, activation, is, more, apparent, in, the, normal, appearing, white, matter, of, ms, patients, astrocytes, generate, neurotoxic, chemicals, like, nitric, oxide, and, tnf, attract, neurotoxic, inflammatory, monocytes, to, the, cns, and, are, responsible, for, astrogliosis, the, scarring, that, prevents, the, spread, of, neuroinflammation, and, kills, neurons, inside, the, scarred, area, in, 2024, scientists, shared, research, on, their, findings, of, ancient, migration, to, northern, europe, from, the, yamnaya, area, of, culture, tracing, ms, risk, gene, variants, dating, back, around, 5, 000, years, the, ms, risk, gene, variants, protected, ancient, cattle, herders, from, animal, diseases, but, modern, lifestyles, diets, and, better, hygiene, have, allowed, the, gene, to, develop, resulting, in, the, higher, risk, of, ms, today, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease
