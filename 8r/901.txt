bryophytes, b, r, a, f, a, t, s, are, a, group, of, land, plants, sometimes, treated, as, a, taxonomic, division, that, contains, three, groups, of, non, vascular, land, plants, embryophytes, the, liverworts, hornworts, and, mosses, in, the, strict, sense, the, division, bryophyta, consists, of, the, mosses, only, bryophytes, are, characteristically, limited, in, size, and, prefer, moist, habitats, although, some, species, can, survive, in, drier, environments, the, bryophytes, consist, of, about, 20, 000, plant, species, bryophytes, produce, enclosed, reproductive, structures, gametangia, and, sporangia, but, they, do, not, produce, flowers, or, seeds, they, reproduce, sexually, by, spores, and, asexually, by, fragmentation, or, the, production, of, gemmae, though, bryophytes, were, considered, a, paraphyletic, group, in, recent, years, almost, all, of, the, most, recent, phylogenetic, evidence, supports, the, monophyly, of, this, group, as, originally, classified, by, wilhelm, schimper, in, 1879, the, term, bryophyte, comes, from, ancient, greek, br, on, tree, moss, liverwort, and, phut, n, plant, the, defining, features, of, bryophytes, are, bryophytes, exist, in, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, they, can, be, found, growing, in, a, range, of, temperatures, cold, arctics, and, in, hot, deserts, elevations, sea, level, to, alpine, and, moisture, dry, deserts, to, wet, rain, forests, bryophytes, can, grow, where, vascularized, plants, cannot, because, they, do, not, depend, on, roots, for, uptake, of, nutrients, from, soil, bryophytes, can, survive, on, rocks, and, bare, soil, like, all, land, plants, embryophytes, bryophytes, have, life, cycles, with, alternation, of, generations, in, each, cycle, a, haploid, gametophyte, each, of, whose, cells, contains, a, fixed, number, of, unpaired, chromosomes, alternates, with, a, diploid, sporophyte, whose, cells, contain, two, sets, of, paired, chromosomes, gametophytes, produce, haploid, sperm, and, eggs, which, fuse, to, form, diploid, zygotes, that, grow, into, sporophytes, sporophytes, produce, haploid, spores, by, meiosis, that, grow, into, gametophytes, bryophytes, are, gametophyte, dominant, meaning, that, the, more, prominent, longer, lived, plant, is, the, haploid, gametophyte, the, diploid, sporophytes, appear, only, occasionally, and, remain, attached, to, and, nutritionally, dependent, on, the, gametophyte, in, bryophytes, the, sporophytes, are, always, unbranched, and, produce, a, single, sporangium, spore, producing, capsule, but, each, gametophyte, can, give, rise, to, several, sporophytes, at, once, liverworts, mosses, and, hornworts, spend, most, of, their, lives, as, gametophytes, gametangia, gamete, producing, organs, archegonia, and, antheridia, are, produced, on, the, gametophytes, sometimes, at, the, tips, of, shoots, in, the, axils, of, leaves, or, hidden, under, thalli, some, bryophytes, such, as, the, liverwort, marchantia, create, elaborate, structures, to, bear, the, gametangia, that, are, called, gametangiophores, sperm, are, flagellated, and, must, swim, from, the, antheridia, that, produce, them, to, archegonia, which, may, be, on, a, different, plant, arthropods, can, assist, in, transfer, of, sperm, fertilized, eggs, become, zygotes, which, develop, into, sporophyte, embryos, inside, the, archegonia, mature, sporophytes, remain, attached, to, the, gametophyte, they, consist, of, a, stalk, called, a, seta, and, a, single, sporangium, or, capsule, inside, the, sporangium, haploid, spores, are, produced, by, meiosis, these, are, dispersed, most, commonly, by, wind, and, if, they, land, in, a, suitable, environment, can, develop, into, a, new, gametophyte, thus, bryophytes, disperse, by, a, combination, of, swimming, sperm, and, spores, in, a, manner, similar, to, lycophytes, ferns, and, other, cryptogams, the, sporophyte, develops, differently, in, the, three, groups, both, mosses, and, hornworts, have, a, meristem, zone, where, cell, division, occurs, in, hornworts, the, meristem, starts, at, the, base, where, the, foot, ends, and, the, division, of, cells, pushes, the, sporophyte, body, upwards, in, mosses, the, meristem, is, located, between, the, capsule, and, the, top, of, the, stalk, seta, and, produces, cells, downward, elongating, the, stalk, and, elevating, the, capsule, in, liverworts, the, meristem, is, absent, and, the, elongation, of, the, sporophyte, is, caused, almost, exclusively, by, cell, expansion, the, arrangement, of, antheridia, and, archegonia, on, an, individual, bryophyte, plant, is, usually, constant, within, a, species, although, in, some, species, it, may, depend, on, environmental, conditions, the, main, division, is, between, species, in, which, the, antheridia, and, archegonia, occur, on, the, same, plant, and, those, in, which, they, occur, on, different, plants, the, term, monoicous, may, be, used, where, antheridia, and, archegonia, occur, on, the, same, gametophyte, and, the, term, dioicous, where, they, occur, on, different, gametophytes, in, seed, plants, monoecious, is, used, where, flowers, with, anthers, microsporangia, and, flowers, with, ovules, megasporangia, occur, on, the, same, sporophyte, and, dioecious, where, they, occur, on, different, sporophytes, these, terms, occasionally, may, be, used, instead, of, monoicous, and, dioicous, to, describe, bryophyte, gametophytes, monoecious, and, monoicous, are, both, derived, from, the, greek, for, one, house, dioecious, and, dioicous, from, the, greek, for, two, houses, the, use, of, the, oicy, terminology, refers, to, the, gametophyte, sexuality, of, bryophytes, as, distinct, from, the, sporophyte, sexuality, of, seed, plants, monoicous, plants, are, necessarily, hermaphroditic, meaning, that, the, same, plant, produces, gametes, of, both, sexes, the, exact, arrangement, of, the, antheridia, and, archegonia, in, monoicous, plants, varies, they, may, be, borne, on, different, shoots, autoicous, on, the, same, shoot, but, not, together, in, a, common, structure, paroicous, or, paroecious, or, together, in, a, common, inflorescence, synoicous, or, synoecious, dioicous, plants, are, unisexual, meaning, that, an, individual, plant, has, only, one, sex, all, four, patterns, autoicous, paroicous, synoicous, and, dioicous, occur, in, species, of, the, moss, genus, bryum, traditionally, all, living, land, plants, without, vascular, tissues, were, classified, in, a, single, taxonomic, group, often, a, division, or, phylum, the, term, bryophyta, was, first, suggested, by, braun, in, 1864, as, early, as, 1879, the, term, bryophyta, was, used, by, german, bryologist, wilhelm, schimper, to, describe, a, group, containing, all, three, bryophyte, clades, though, at, the, time, hornworts, were, considered, part, of, the, liverworts, g, m, smith, placed, this, group, between, algae, and, pteridophyta, although, a, 2005, study, supported, this, traditional, monophyletic, view, by, 2010, a, broad, consensus, had, emerged, among, systematists, that, bryophytes, as, a, whole, are, not, a, natural, group, i, e, are, paraphyletic, however, a, 2014, study, concluded, that, these, previous, phylogenies, which, were, based, on, nucleic, acid, sequences, were, subject, to, composition, biases, and, that, furthermore, phylogenies, based, on, amino, acid, sequences, suggested, that, the, bryophytes, are, monophyletic, after, all, since, then, partially, thanks, to, a, proliferation, of, genomic, and, transcriptomic, datasets, almost, all, phylogenetics, studies, based, on, nuclear, and, chloroplastic, sequences, have, concluded, that, the, bryophytes, form, a, monophyletic, group, nevertheless, phylogenies, based, on, mitochondrial, sequences, fail, to, support, the, monophyletic, view, the, three, bryophyte, clades, are, the, marchantiophyta, liverworts, bryophyta, mosses, and, anthocerotophyta, hornworts, however, it, has, been, proposed, that, these, clades, are, de, ranked, to, the, classes, marchantiopsida, bryopsida, and, anthocerotopsida, respectively, there, is, now, strong, evidence, that, the, liverworts, and, mosses, belong, to, a, monophyletic, clade, called, setaphyta, the, favored, model, based, on, amino, acids, phylogenies, indicates, bryophytes, as, a, monophyletic, group, vascular, plants, hornworts, mosses, liverworts, consistent, with, this, view, compared, to, other, living, land, plants, all, three, lineages, lack, vascular, tissue, containing, lignin, and, branched, sporophytes, bearing, multiple, sporangia, the, prominence, of, the, gametophyte, in, the, life, cycle, is, also, a, shared, feature, of, the, three, bryophyte, lineages, extant, vascular, plants, are, all, sporophyte, dominant, however, if, this, phylogeny, is, correct, then, the, complex, sporophyte, of, living, vascular, plants, might, have, evolved, independently, of, the, simpler, unbranched, sporophyte, present, in, bryophytes, furthermore, this, view, implies, that, stomata, evolved, only, once, in, plant, evolution, before, being, subsequently, lost, in, the, liverworts, vascular, plants, hornworts, mosses, liverworts, in, this, alternative, view, the, setaphyta, grouping, is, retained, but, hornworts, instead, are, sister, to, vascular, plants, another, paraphyletic, view, involves, hornworts, branching, out, first, traditionally, when, basing, classifications, on, morphological, characters, bryophytes, have, been, distinguished, by, their, lack, of, vascular, structure, however, this, distinction, is, problematic, firstly, because, some, of, the, earliest, diverging, but, now, extinct, non, bryophytes, such, as, the, horneophytes, did, not, have, true, vascular, tissue, and, secondly, because, many, mosses, have, well, developed, water, conducting, vessels, a, more, useful, distinction, may, lie, in, the, structure, of, their, sporophytes, in, bryophytes, the, sporophyte, is, a, simple, unbranched, structure, with, a, single, spore, forming, organ, sporangium, whereas, in, all, other, land, plants, the, polysporangiophytes, the, sporophyte, is, branched, and, carries, many, sporangia, the, contrast, is, shown, in, the, cladogram, below, bryophytes, protracheophytes, such, as, aglaophyton, or, horneophyton, tracheophytes, or, vascular, plants, there, have, probably, been, several, different, terrestrialization, events, in, which, originally, aquatic, organisms, colonized, the, land, just, within, the, lineage, of, the, viridiplantae, between, 510, 630, million, years, ago, however, land, plants, emerged, within, the, green, algae, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, conclude, that, bryophytes, are, the, earliest, diverging, lineages, of, the, extant, land, plants, they, provide, insights, into, the, migration, of, plants, from, aquatic, environments, to, land, a, number, of, physical, features, link, bryophytes, to, both, land, plants, and, aquatic, plants, green, algae, bryophytes, and, vascular, plants, all, have, chlorophyll, a, and, b, and, the, chloroplast, structures, are, similar, like, green, algae, and, land, plants, bryophytes, also, produce, starch, stored, in, the, plastids, and, contain, cellulose, in, their, walls, distinct, adaptations, observed, in, bryophytes, have, allowed, plants, to, colonize, earth, s, terrestrial, environments, to, prevent, desiccation, of, plant, tissues, in, a, terrestrial, environment, a, waxy, cuticle, covering, the, soft, tissue, of, the, plant, may, be, present, providing, protection, in, hornworts, and, mosses, stomata, provide, gas, exchange, between, the, atmosphere, and, an, internal, intercellular, space, system, the, development, of, gametangia, provided, further, protection, specifically, for, gametes, the, zygote, and, the, developing, sporophyte, the, bryophytes, and, vascular, plants, embryophytes, also, have, embryonic, development, which, is, not, seen, in, green, algae, while, bryophytes, have, no, truly, vascularized, tissue, they, do, have, organs, that, are, specialized, for, transport, of, water, and, other, specific, functions, analogous, for, example, to, the, functions, of, leaves, and, stems, in, vascular, land, plants, bryophytes, depend, on, water, for, reproduction, and, survival, in, common, with, ferns, and, lycophytes, a, thin, layer, of, water, is, required, on, the, surface, of, the, plant, to, enable, the, movement, of, the, flagellated, sperm, between, gametophytes, and, the, fertilization, of, an, egg, summary, of, the, morphological, characteristics, of, the, gametophytes, of, the, three, groups, of, bryophytes, summary, of, the, morphological, characteristics, of, the, sporophytes, of, the, three, groups, of, bryophytes, environmental, characteristics, of, bryophytes, make, them, useful, to, the, environment, depending, on, the, specific, plant, texture, bryophytes, have, been, shown, to, help, improve, the, water, retention, and, air, space, within, soil, bryophytes, are, used, in, pollution, studies, to, indicate, soil, pollution, such, as, the, presence, of, heavy, metals, air, pollution, and, uv, b, radiation, gardens, in, japan, are, designed, with, moss, to, create, peaceful, sanctuaries, some, bryophytes, have, been, found, to, produce, natural, pesticides, the, liverwort, plagiochila, produces, a, chemical, that, is, poisonous, to, mice, other, bryophytes, produce, chemicals, that, are, antifeedants, which, protect, them, from, being, eaten, by, slugs, when, phythium, sphagnum, is, sprinkled, on, the, soil, of, germinating, seeds, it, inhibits, growth, of, damping, off, fungus, which, would,
