penicillins, p, pcn, or, pen, are, a, group, of, lactam, antibiotics, originally, obtained, from, penicillium, moulds, principally, p, chrysogenum, and, p, rubens, most, penicillins, in, clinical, use, are, synthesised, by, p, chrysogenum, using, deep, tank, fermentation, and, then, purified, a, number, of, natural, penicillins, have, been, discovered, but, only, two, purified, compounds, are, in, clinical, use, penicillin, g, intramuscular, or, intravenous, use, and, penicillin, v, given, by, mouth, penicillins, were, among, the, first, medications, to, be, effective, against, many, bacterial, infections, caused, by, staphylococci, and, streptococci, they, are, still, widely, used, today, for, various, bacterial, infections, though, many, types, of, bacteria, have, developed, resistance, following, extensive, use, ten, percent, of, the, population, claims, penicillin, allergies, but, because, the, frequency, of, positive, skin, test, results, decreases, by, 10, with, each, year, of, avoidance, 90, of, these, patients, can, eventually, tolerate, penicillin, additionally, those, with, penicillin, allergies, can, usually, tolerate, cephalosporins, another, group, of, lactam, because, the, immunoglobulin, e, ige, cross, reactivity, is, only, 3, penicillin, was, discovered, in, 1928, by, scottish, scientist, alexander, fleming, as, a, crude, extract, of, p, rubens, fleming, s, student, cecil, george, paine, was, the, first, to, successfully, use, penicillin, to, treat, eye, infection, neonatal, conjunctivitis, in, 1930, the, purified, compound, penicillin, f, was, isolated, in, 1940, by, a, research, team, led, by, howard, florey, and, ernst, boris, chain, at, the, university, of, oxford, fleming, first, used, the, purified, penicillin, to, treat, streptococcal, meningitis, in, 1942, the, 1945, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, was, shared, by, chain, fleming, and, florey, several, semisynthetic, penicillins, are, effective, against, a, broader, spectrum, of, bacteria, these, include, the, antistaphylococcal, penicillins, aminopenicillins, and, antipseudomonal, penicillins, the, term, penicillin, is, defined, as, the, natural, product, of, penicillium, mould, with, antimicrobial, activity, it, was, coined, by, alexander, fleming, on, 7, march, 1929, when, he, discovered, the, antibacterial, property, of, penicillium, rubens, fleming, explained, in, his, 1929, paper, in, the, british, journal, of, experimental, pathology, that, to, avoid, the, repetition, of, the, rather, cumbersome, phrase, mould, broth, filtrate, the, name, penicillin, will, be, used, the, name, thus, refers, to, the, scientific, name, of, the, mould, as, described, by, fleming, in, his, nobel, lecture, in, 1945, i, have, been, frequently, asked, why, i, invented, the, name, penicillin, i, simply, followed, perfectly, orthodox, lines, and, coined, a, word, which, explained, that, the, substance, penicillin, was, derived, from, a, plant, of, the, genus, penicillium, just, as, many, years, ago, the, word, digitalin, was, invented, for, a, substance, derived, from, the, plant, digitalis, in, modern, usage, the, term, penicillin, is, used, more, broadly, to, refer, to, any, lactam, antimicrobial, that, contains, a, thiazolidine, ring, fused, to, the, lactam, core, and, may, or, may, not, be, a, natural, product, like, most, natural, products, penicillin, is, present, in, penicillium, moulds, as, a, mixture, of, active, constituents, gentamicin, is, another, example, of, a, natural, product, that, is, an, ill, defined, mixture, of, active, components, the, principal, active, components, of, penicillium, are, listed, in, the, following, table, other, minor, active, components, of, penicillium, include, penicillin, o, penicillin, u1, and, penicillin, u6, other, named, constituents, of, natural, penicillium, such, as, penicillin, a, were, subsequently, found, not, to, have, antibiotic, activity, and, are, not, chemically, related, to, antibiotic, penicillins, the, precise, constitution, of, the, penicillin, extracted, depends, on, the, species, of, penicillium, mould, used, and, on, the, nutrient, media, used, to, culture, the, mould, fleming, s, original, strain, of, penicillium, rubens, produces, principally, penicillin, f, named, after, fleming, but, penicillin, f, is, unstable, difficult, to, isolate, and, produced, by, the, mould, in, small, quantities, the, principal, commercial, strain, of, penicillium, chrysogenum, the, peoria, strain, produces, penicillin, g, as, the, principal, component, when, corn, steep, liquor, is, used, as, the, culture, medium, when, phenoxyethanol, or, phenoxyacetic, acid, are, added, to, the, culture, medium, the, mould, produces, penicillin, v, as, the, main, penicillin, instead, 6, aminopenicillanic, acid, 6, apa, is, a, compound, derived, from, penicillin, g, 6, apa, contains, the, beta, lactam, core, of, penicillin, g, but, with, the, side, chains, stripped, off, 6, apa, is, a, useful, precursor, for, manufacturing, other, penicillins, there, are, many, semi, synthetic, penicillins, derived, from, 6, apa, and, these, are, in, three, groups, antistaphylococcal, penicillins, broad, spectrum, penicillins, and, antipseudomonal, penicillins, the, semi, synthetic, penicillins, are, all, referred, to, as, penicillins, because, they, are, all, derived, ultimately, from, penicillin, g, the, use, of, units, to, prescribe, penicillin, is, a, historical, accident, and, is, largely, obsolete, outside, of, the, us, since, the, original, penicillin, was, an, ill, defined, mixture, of, active, compounds, an, amorphous, yellow, powder, the, potency, of, each, batch, of, penicillin, varied, from, batch, to, batch, it, was, therefore, impossible, to, prescribe, 1, g, of, penicillin, because, the, activity, of, 1, g, of, penicillin, from, one, batch, would, be, different, from, the, activity, from, another, batch, after, manufacture, each, batch, of, penicillin, had, to, be, standardised, against, a, known, unit, of, penicillin, each, glass, vial, was, then, filled, with, the, number, of, units, required, in, the, 1940s, a, vial, of, 5, 000, oxford, units, was, standard, but, the, depending, on, the, batch, could, contain, anything, from, 15, mg, to, 20, mg, of, penicillin, later, a, vial, of, 1, 000, 000, international, units, became, standard, and, this, could, contain, 2, 5, g, to, 3, g, of, natural, penicillin, a, mixture, of, penicillin, i, ii, iii, and, iv, and, natural, impurities, with, the, advent, of, pure, penicillin, g, preparations, a, white, crystalline, powder, there, is, little, reason, to, prescribe, penicillin, in, units, the, unit, of, penicillin, has, had, three, previous, definitions, and, each, definition, was, chosen, as, being, roughly, equivalent, to, the, previous, one, there, is, an, older, unit, for, penicillin, v, that, is, not, equivalent, to, the, current, penicillin, v, unit, the, reason, is, that, the, us, fda, incorrectly, assumed, that, the, potency, of, penicillin, v, is, the, same, mole, for, mole, as, penicillin, g, in, fact, penicillin, v, is, less, potent, than, penicillin, g, and, the, current, penicillin, v, unit, reflects, that, fact, a, similar, standard, was, also, established, for, penicillin, k, penicillins, consist, of, a, distinct, 4, membered, beta, lactam, ring, in, addition, to, a, thiazolide, ring, and, an, r, side, chain, the, main, distinguishing, feature, between, variants, within, this, family, is, the, r, substituent, this, side, chain, is, connected, to, the, 6, aminopenicillanic, acid, residue, and, results, in, variations, in, the, antimicrobial, spectrum, stability, and, susceptibility, to, beta, lactamases, of, each, type, penicillin, g, benzylpenicillin, was, first, produced, from, a, penicillium, fungus, that, occurs, in, nature, the, strain, of, fungus, used, today, for, the, manufacture, of, penicillin, g, was, created, by, genetic, engineering, to, improve, the, yield, in, the, manufacturing, process, none, of, the, other, natural, penicillins, f, k, n, x, o, u1, or, u6, are, currently, in, clinical, use, penicillin, v, phenoxymethylpenicillin, is, produced, by, adding, the, precursor, phenoxyacetic, acid, to, the, medium, in, which, a, genetically, modified, strain, of, the, penicillium, fungus, is, being, cultured, there, are, three, major, groups, of, other, semi, synthetic, antibiotics, related, to, the, penicillins, they, are, synthesised, by, adding, various, side, chains, to, the, precursor, 6, apa, which, is, isolated, from, penicillin, g, these, are, the, antistaphylococcal, antibiotics, broad, spectrum, antibiotics, and, antipseudomonal, antibiotics, antistaphylococcal, antibiotics, are, so, called, because, they, are, resistant, to, being, broken, down, by, staphylococcal, penicillinase, they, are, also, therefore, referred, to, as, being, penicillinase, resistant, this, group, of, antibiotics, is, called, broad, spectrum, because, they, are, active, against, a, wide, range, of, gram, negative, bacteria, such, as, escherichia, coli, and, salmonella, typhi, for, which, penicillin, is, not, suitable, however, resistance, in, these, organisms, is, now, common, there, are, many, ampicillin, precursors, in, existence, these, are, inactive, compounds, that, are, broken, down, in, the, gut, to, release, ampicillin, none, of, these, pro, drugs, of, ampicillin, are, in, current, use, epicillin, is, an, aminopenicillin, that, has, never, seen, widespread, clinical, use, the, gram, negative, species, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, is, naturally, resistant, to, many, antibiotic, classes, there, were, many, efforts, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, to, develop, antibiotics, that, are, active, against, pseudomonas, species, there, are, two, chemical, classes, within, the, group, carboxypenicillins, and, ureidopenicillins, all, are, given, by, injection, none, can, be, given, by, mouth, the, term, penicillin, when, used, by, itself, may, refer, to, either, of, two, chemical, compounds, penicillin, g, or, penicillin, v, penicillin, g, is, destroyed, by, stomach, acid, so, it, cannot, be, taken, by, mouth, but, doses, as, high, as, 2, 4, g, can, be, given, much, higher, than, penicillin, v, it, is, given, by, intravenous, or, intramuscular, injection, it, can, be, formulated, as, an, insoluble, salt, and, there, are, two, such, formulations, in, current, use, procaine, penicillin, and, benzathine, benzylpenicillin, when, a, high, concentration, in, the, blood, must, be, maintained, penicillin, g, must, be, administered, at, relatively, frequent, intervals, because, it, is, eliminated, quite, rapidly, from, the, bloodstream, by, the, kidney, penicillin, g, is, licensed, for, use, to, treat, septicaemia, empyema, pneumonia, pericarditis, endocarditis, and, meningitis, caused, by, susceptible, strains, of, staphylococci, and, streptococci, it, is, also, licensed, for, the, treatment, of, anthrax, actinomycosis, cervicofacial, disease, thoracic, and, abdominal, disease, clostridial, infections, botulism, gas, gangrene, with, accompanying, debridement, and, or, surgery, as, indicated, tetanus, as, an, adjunctive, therapy, to, human, tetanus, immune, globulin, diphtheria, as, an, adjunctive, therapy, to, antitoxin, and, for, the, prevention, of, the, carrier, state, erysipelothrix, endocarditis, fusospirochetosis, severe, infections, of, the, oropharynx, lower, respiratory, tract, and, genital, area, listeria, infections, meningitis, endocarditis, pasteurella, infections, including, bacteraemia, and, meningitis, haverhill, fever, rat, bite, fever, and, disseminated, gonococcal, infections, meningococcal, meningitis, and, or, septicaemia, caused, by, penicillin, susceptible, organisms, and, syphilis, penicillin, v, can, be, taken, by, mouth, because, it, is, relatively, resistant, to, stomach, acid, doses, higher, than, 500, mg, are, not, fully, effective, because, of, poor, absorption, it, is, used, for, the, same, bacterial, infections, as, those, of, penicillin, g, and, is, the, most, widely, used, form, of, penicillin, however, it, is, not, used, for, diseases, such, as, endocarditis, where, high, blood, levels, of, penicillin, are, required, because, penicillin, resistance, is, now, so, common, other, antibiotics, are, now, the, preferred, choice, for, treatments, for, example, penicillin, used, to, be, the, first, line, treatment, for, infections, with, neisseria, gonorrhoeae, and, neisseria, meningitidis, but, it, is, no, longer, recommended, for, treatment, of, these, infections, penicillin, resistance, is, now, very, common, in, staphylococcus, aureus, which, means, penicillin, should, not, be, used, to, treat, infections, caused, by, s, aureus, infection, unless, the, infecting, strain, is, known, to, be, susceptible, common, 1, of, people, adverse, drug, reactions, associated, with, use, of, the, penicillins, include, diarrhoea, hypersensitivity, nausea, rash, neurotoxicity, urticaria, and, superinfection, including, candidiasis, infrequent, adverse, effects, 0, 1, 1, of, people, include, fever, vomiting, erythema, dermatitis, angioedema, seizures, especially, in, people, with, epilepsy, and, pseudomembranous, colitis, penicillin, can, also, induce, serum, sickness, or, a, serum, sickness, like, reaction, in, some, individuals, serum, sickness, is, a, type, iii, hypersensitivity, reaction, that, occurs, one, to, three, weeks, after, exposure, to, drugs, including, penicillin, it, is, not, a, true, drug, allergy, because, allergies, are, type, i, hypersensitivity, reactions, but, repeated, exposure, to, the, offending, agent, can, result, in, an, anaphylactic, reaction, allergy, will, occur, in, 1, 10, of, people, presenting, as, a, skin, rash, after, exposure, ige, mediated, anaphylaxis, will, occur, in, approximately, 0, 01, of, patients, pain, and, inflammation, at, the, injection, site, are, also, common, for, parenterally, administered, benzathine, benzylpenicillin, benzylpenicillin, and, to, a, lesser, extent, procaine, benzylpenicillin, the, condition, is, known, as, livedoid, dermatitis, or, nicolau, syndrome, the, term, penam, is, used, to, describe, the, common, core, skeleton, of, a, member, of, the, penicillins, this, core, has, the, molecular, formula, r, c, 9, h, 11, n, 2, o, 4, s, where, r, is, the, variable, side, chain, that, differentiates, the, penicillins, from, one, another, the, penam, core, has, a, molar, mass, of, 243, g, mol, with, larger, penicillins, having, molar, mass, near, 450, for, example, cloxacillin, has, a, molar, mass, of, 436, g, mol, 6, apa, c, 8, h, 12, n, 2, o, 3, s, forms, the, basic, structure, of, penicillins, it, is, made, up, of, an, enclosed, dipeptide, formed, by, the, condensation, of, l, cysteine, and, d, valine, this, results, in, the, formations, of, lactam, and, thiazolidinic, rings, the, key, structural, feature, of, the, penicillins, is, the, four, membered, lactam, ring, this, structural, moiety, is, essential, for, penicillin, s, antibacterial, activity, the, lactam, ring, is, itself, fused, to, a, five, membered, thiazolidine, ring, the, fusion, of, these, two, rings, causes, the, lactam, ring, to, be, more, reactive, than, monocyclic, lactams, because, the, two, fused, rings, distort, the, lactam, amide, bond, and, therefore, remove, the, resonance, stabilisation, normally, found, in, these, chemical, bonds, an, acyl, side, side, chain, attached, to, the, lactam, ring, a, variety, of, lactam, antibiotics, have, been, produced, following, chemical, modification, from, the, 6, apa, structure, during, synthesis, specifically, by, making, chemical, substitutions, in, the, acyl, side, chain, for, example, the, first, chemically, altered, penicillin, methicillin, had, substitutions, by, methoxy, groups, at, positions, 2, and, 6, of, the, 6, apa, benzene, ring, from, penicillin, g, this, difference, makes, methicillin, resistant, to, the, activity, of, lactamase, an, enzyme, by, which, many, bacteria, are, naturally, unsusceptible, to, penicillins, penicillin, can, easily, enter, bacterial, cells, in, the, case, of, gram, positive, species, this, is, because, gram, positive, bacteria, do, not, have, an, outer, cell, membrane, and, are, simply, enclosed, in, a, thick, cell, wall, penicillin, molecules, are, small, enough, to, pass, through, the, spaces, of, glycoproteins, in, the, cell, wall, for, this, reason, gram, positive, bacteria, are, very, susceptible, to, penicillin, as, first, evidenced, by, the, discovery, of, penicillin, in, 1928, penicillin, or, any, other, molecule, enters, gram, negative, bacteria, in, a, different, manner, the, bacteria, have, thinner, cell, walls, but, the, external, surface, is, coated, with, an, additional, cell, membrane, called, the, outer, membrane, the, outer, membrane, is, a, lipid, layer, lipopolysaccharide, chain, that, blocks, passage, of, water, soluble, hydrophilic, molecules, like, penicillin, it, thus, acts, as, the, first, line, of, defence, against, any, toxic, substance, which, is, the, reason, for, relative, resistance, to, antibiotics, compared, to, gram, positive, species, but, penicillin, can, still, enter, gram, negative, species, by, diffusing, through, aqueous, channels, called, porins, outer, membrane, proteins, which, are, dispersed, among, the, fatty, molecules, and, can, transport, nutrients, and, antibiotics, into, the, bacteria, porins, are, large, enough, to, allow, diffusion, of, most, penicillins, but, the, rate, of, diffusion, through, them, is, determined, by, the, specific, size, of, the, drug, molecules, for, instance, penicillin, g, is, large, and, enters, through, porins, slowly, while, smaller, ampicillin, and, amoxicillin, diffuse, much, faster, in, contrast, large, vancomycin, can, not, pass, through, porins, and, is, thus, ineffective, for, gram, negative, bacteria, the, size, and, number, of, porins, are, different, in, different, bacteria, as, a, result, of, the, two, factors, size, of, penicillin, and, porin, gram, negative, bacteria, can, be, unsusceptible, or, have, varying, degree, of, susceptibility, to, specific, penicillin, penicillin, kills, bacteria, by, inhibiting, the, completion, of, the, synthesis, of, peptidoglycans, the, structural, component, of, the, bacterial, cell, wall, it, specifically, inhibits, the, activity, of, enzymes, that, are, needed, for, the, cross, linking, of, peptidoglycans, during, the, final, step, in, cell, wall, biosynthesis, it, does, this, by, binding, to, penicillin, binding, proteins, with, the, lactam, ring, a, structure, found, on, penicillin, molecules, this, causes, the, cell, wall, to, weaken, due, to, fewer, cross, links, and, means, water, uncontrollably, flows, into, the, cell, because, it, cannot, maintain, the, correct, osmotic, gradient, this, results, in, cell, lysis, and, death, bacteria, constantly, remodel, their, peptidoglycan, cell, walls, simultaneously, building, and, breaking, down, portions, of, the, cell, wall, as, they, grow, and, divide, during, the, last, stages, of, peptidoglycan, biosynthesis, uridine, diphosphate, n, acetylmuramic, acid, pentapeptide, udp, murnac, is, formed, in, which, the, fourth, and, fifth, amino, acids, are, both, d, alanyl, d, alanine, the, transfer, of, d, alanine, is, done, catalysed, by, the, enzyme, dd, transpeptidase, penicillin, binding, proteins, are, such, type, the, structural, integrity, of, bacterial, cell, wall, depends, on, the, cross, linking, of, udp, murnac, and, n, acetyl, glucosamine, penicillin, and, other, lactam, antibiotics, act, as, an, analogue, of, d, alanine, d, alanine, the, dipeptide, in, udp, murnac, owing, to, conformational, similarities, the, dd, transpeptidase, then, binds, the, four, membered, lactam, ring, of, penicillin, instead, of, udp, murnac, as, a, consequence, dd, transpeptidase, is, inactivated, the, formation, of, cross, links, between, udp, murnac, and, n, acetyl, glucosamine, is, blocked, so, that, an, imbalance, between, cell, wall, production, and, degradation, develops, causing, the, cell, to, rapidly, die, the, enzymes, that, hydrolyze, the, peptidoglycan, cross, links, continue, to, function, even, while, those, that, form, such, cross, links, do, not, this, weakens, the, cell, wall, of, the, bacterium, and, osmotic, pressure, becomes, increasingly, uncompensated, eventually, causing, cell, death, cytolysis, in, addition, the, build, up, of, peptidoglycan, precursors, triggers, the, activation, of, bacterial, cell, wall, hydrolases, and, autolysins, which, further, digest, the, cell, wall, s, peptidoglycans, the, small, size, of, the, penicillins, increases, their, potency, by, allowing, them, to, penetrate, the, entire, depth, of, the, cell, wall, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, glycopeptide, antibiotics, vancomycin, and, teicoplanin, which, are, both, much, larger, than, the, penicillins, gram, positive, bacteria, are, called, protoplasts, when, they, lose, their, cell, walls, gram, negative, bacteria, do, not, lose, their, cell, walls, completely, and, are, called, spheroplasts, after, treatment, with, penicillin, penicillin, shows, a, synergistic, effect, with, aminoglycosides, since, the, inhibition, of, peptidoglycan, synthesis, allows, aminoglycosides, to, penetrate, the, bacterial, cell, wall, more, easily, allowing, their, disruption, of, bacterial, protein, synthesis, within, the, cell, this, results, in, a, lowered, mbc, for, susceptible, organisms, penicillins, like, other, lactam, antibiotics, block, not, only, the, division, of, bacteria, including, cyanobacteria, but, also, the, division, of, cyanelles, the, photosynthetic, organelles, of, the, glaucophytes, and, the, division, of, chloroplasts, of, bryophytes, in, contrast, they, have, no, effect, on, the, plastids, of, the, highly, developed, vascular, plants, this, supports, the, endosymbiotic, theory, of, the, evolution, of, plastid, division, in, land, plants, some, bacteria, produce, enzymes, that, break, down, the, lactam, ring, called, lactamases, which, make, the, bacteria, resistant, to, penicillin, therefore, some, penicillins, are, modified, or, given, with, other, drugs, for, use, against, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, or, in, immunocompromised, patients, the, use, of, clavulanic, acid, or, tazobactam, lactamase, inhibitors, alongside, penicillin, gives, penicillin, activity, against, lactamase, producing, bacteria, lactamase, inhibitors, irreversibly, bind, to, lactamase, preventing, it, from, breaking, down, the, beta, lactam, rings, on, the, antibiotic, molecule, alternatively, flucloxacillin, is, a, modified, penicillin, that, has, activity, against, lactamase, producing, bacteria, due, to, an, acyl, side, chain, that, protects, the, beta, lactam, ring, from, lactamase, penicillin, has, low, protein, binding, in, plasma, the, bioavailability, of, penicillin, depends, on, the, type, penicillin, g, has, low, bioavailability, below, 30, whereas, penicillin, v, has, higher, bioavailability, between, 60, and, 70, penicillin, has, a, short, half, life, and, is, excreted, via, the, kidneys, this, means, it, must, be, dosed, at, least, four, times, a, day, to, maintain, adequate, levels, of, penicillin, in, the, blood, early, manuals, on, the, use, of, penicillin, therefore, recommended, injections, of, penicillin, as, frequently, as, every, three, hours, and, dosing, penicillin, has, been, described, as, being, similar, to, trying, to, fill, a, bath, with, the, plug, out, this, is, no, longer, required, since, much, larger, doses, of, penicillin, are, cheaply, and, easily, available, however, some, authorities, recommend, the, use, of, continuous, penicillin, infusions, for, this, reason, when, alexander, fleming, discovered, the, crude, penicillin, in, 1928, one, important, observation, he, made, was, that, many, bacteria, were, not, affected, by, penicillin, this, phenomenon, was, realised, by, ernst, chain, and, edward, abraham, while, trying, to, identify, the, exact, of, penicillin, in, 1940, they, discovered, that, unsusceptible, bacteria, like, escherichia, coli, produced, specific, enzymes, that, can, break, down, penicillin, molecules, thus, making, them, resistant, to, the, antibiotic, they, named, the, enzyme, penicillinase, penicillinase, is, now, classified, as, member, of, enzymes, called, lactamases, these, lactamases, are, naturally, present, in, many, other, bacteria, and, many, bacteria, produce, them, upon, constant, exposure, to, antibiotics, in, most, bacteria, resistance, can, be, through, three, different, mechanisms, reduced, permeability, in, bacteria, reduced, binding, affinity, of, the, penicillin, binding, proteins, pbps, or, destruction, of, the, antibiotic, through, the, expression, of, lactamase, using, any, of, these, bacteria, commonly, develop, resistance, to, different, antibiotics, a, phenomenon, called, multi, drug, resistance, the, actual, process, of, resistance, mechanism, can, be, very, complex, in, case, of, reduced, permeability, in, bacteria, the, mechanisms, are, different, between, gram, positive, and, gram, negative, bacteria, in, gram, positive, bacteria, blockage, of, penicillin, is, due, to, changes, in, the, cell, wall, for, example, resistance, to, vancomycin, in, s, aureus, is, due, to, additional, peptidoglycan, synthesis, that, makes, the, cell, wall, much, thicker, preventing, effective, penicillin, entry, resistance, in, gram, negative, bacteria, is, due, to, mutational, variations, in, the, structure, and, number, of, porins, in, bacteria, like, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, there, is, reduced, number, of, porins, whereas, in, bacteria, like, enterobacter, species, escherichia, coli, and, klebsiella, pneumoniae, there, are, modified, porins, such, as, non, specific, porins, such, as, ompc, and, ompf, groups, that, cannot, transport, penicillin, resistance, due, to, pbp, alterations, is, highly, varied, a, common, case, is, found, in, streptococcus, pneumoniae, where, there, is, mutation, in, the, gene, for, pbp, and, the, mutant, pbps, have, decreased, binding, affinity, for, penicillins, there, are, six, mutant, pbps, in, s, pneumoniae, of, which, pbp1a, pbp2b, pbp2x, and, sometimes, pbp2a, are, responsible, for, reduced, binding, affinity, s, aureus, can, activate, a, hidden, gene, that, produces, a, different, pbp, pbd2, which, has, low, binding, affinity, for, penicillins, there, is, a, different, strain, of, s, aureus, named, methicillin, resistant, s, aureus, mrsa, which, is, resistant, not, only, to, penicillin, and, other, lactams, but, also, to, most, antibiotics, the, bacterial, strain, developed, after, introduction, of, methicillin, in, 1959, in, mrsa, mutations, in, the, genes, mec, system, for, pbp, produce, a, variant, protein, called, pbp2a, also, termed, pbp2, while, making, four, normal, pbps, pbp2a, has, poor, binding, affinity, for, penicillin, and, also, lacks, glycosyltransferase, activity, required, for, complete, peptidoglycan, synthesis, which, is, carried, out, by, the, four, normal, pbps, in, helicobacter, cinaedi, there, are, multiple, mutations, in, different, genes, that, make, pbp, variants, enzymatic, destruction, by, lactamases, is, the, most, important, mechanism, of, penicillin, resistance, and, is, described, as, the, greatest, threat, to, the, usage, it, was, the, first, discovered, mechanism, of, penicillin, resistance, during, the, experiments, when, purification, and, biological, activity, tests, of, penicillin, were, performed, in, 1940, it, was, found, that, e, coli, was, unsusceptible, the, reason, was, discovered, as, production, of, an, enzyme, penicillinase, hence, the, first, lactamase, known, in, e, coli, that, easily, degraded, penicillin, there, are, over, 2, 000, types, of, lactamases, each, of, which, has, unique, amino, acid, sequence, and, thus, enzymatic, activity, all, of, them, are, able, to, hydrolyse, lactam, rings, but, their, exact, target, sites, are, different, they, are, secreted, on, the, bacterial, surface, in, large, quantities, in, gram, positive, bacteria, but, less, so, in, gram, negative, species, therefore, in, a, mixed, bacterial, infection, the, gram, positive, bacteria, can, protect, the, otherwise, penicillin, susceptible, gram, negative, cells, there, are, unusual, mechanisms, in, p, aeruginosa, in, which, there, can, be, biofilm, mediated, resistance, and, formation, of, multidrug, tolerant, persister, cells, starting, in, the, late, 19th, century, there, had, been, reports, of, the, antibacterial, properties, of, penicillium, mould, but, scientists, were, unable, to, discern, what, process, was, causing, the, effect, scottish, physician, alexander, fleming, at, st, mary, s, hospital, in, london, now, part, of, imperial, college, was, the, first, to, show, that, penicillium, rubens, had, antibacterial, properties, on, 3, september, 1928, he, observed, by, chance, that, fungal, contamination, of, a, bacterial, culture, staphylococcus, aureus, appeared, to, kill, the, bacteria, he, confirmed, this, observation, with, a, new, experiment, on, 28, september, 1928, he, published, his, experiment, in, 1929, and, called, the, antibacterial, substance, the, fungal, extract, penicillin, c, j, la, touche, identified, the, fungus, as, penicillium, rubrum, later, reclassified, by, charles, thom, as, p, notatum, and, p, chrysogenum, but, later, corrected, as, p, rubens, fleming, expressed, initial, optimism, that, penicillin, would, be, a, useful, antiseptic, because, of, its, high, potency, and, minimal, toxicity, in, comparison, to, other, antiseptics, of, the, day, and, noted, its, laboratory, value, in, the, isolation, of, bacillus, influenzae, now, called, haemophilus, influenzae, fleming, did, not, convince, anyone, that, his, discovery, was, important, this, was, largely, because, penicillin, was, so, difficult, to, isolate, that, its, development, as, a, drug, seemed, impossible, it, is, speculated, that, had, fleming, been, more, successful, at, making, other, scientists, interested, in, his, work, penicillin, would, possibly, have, been, developed, years, earlier, the, importance, of, his, work, has, been, recognized, by, the, placement, of, an, international, historic, chemical, landmark, at, the, alexander, fleming, laboratory, museum, in, london, on, 19, november, 1999, in, 1930, cecil, george, paine, a, pathologist, at, the, royal, infirmary, in, sheffield, successfully, treated, ophthalmia, neonatorum, a, gonococcal, infection, in, infants, with, penicillin, fungal, extract, on, november, 25, 1930, in, 1940, australian, scientist, howard, florey, later, baron, florey, and, a, team, of, researchers, ernst, chain, edward, abraham, arthur, duncan, gardner, norman, heatley, margaret, jennings, jean, orr, ewing, and, arthur, gordon, sanders, at, the, sir, william, dunn, school, of, pathology, university, of, oxford, made, progress, in, making, concentrated, penicillin, from, fungal, culture, broth, that, showed, both, in, vitro, and, in, vivo, bactericidal, action, in, 1941, they, treated, a, policeman, albert, alexander, with, a, severe, face, infection, his, condition, improved, but, then, supplies, of, penicillin, ran, out, and, he, died, subsequently, several, other, patients, were, treated, successfully, in, december, 1942, survivors, of, the, cocoanut, grove, fire, in, boston, were, the, first, burn, patients, to, be, successfully, treated, with, penicillin, the, first, successful, use, of, pure, penicillin, was, in, 1942, when, fleming, cured, harry, lambert, of, an, infection, of, the, nervous, system, streptococcal, meningitis, which, would, otherwise, have, been, fatal, by, that, time, the, oxford, team, could, produce, only, a, small, amount, florey, willingly, gave, the, only, available, sample, to, fleming, lambert, showed, improvement, from, the, very, next, day, of, the, treatment, and, was, completely, cured, within, a, week, fleming, published, his, clinical, trial, in, the, lancet, in, 1943, following, the, medical, breakthrough, the, british, war, cabinet, set, up, the, penicillin, committee, on, 5, april, 1943, that, led, to, projects, for, mass, production, as, the, medical, application, was, established, the, oxford, team, found, that, it, was, impossible, to, produce, usable, amounts, in, their, laboratory, failing, to, persuade, the, british, government, florey, and, heatley, travelled, to, the, us, in, june, 1941, with, their, mould, samples, in, order, to, interest, the, us, government, for, large, scale, production, they, approached, the, usda, northern, regional, research, laboratory, nrrl, now, the, national, center, for, agricultural, utilization, research, at, peoria, illinois, where, facilities, for, large, scale, fermentations, were, established, mass, culture, of, the, mould, and, search, for, better, moulds, immediately, followed, on, march, 14, 1942, the, first, patient, was, treated, for, streptococcal, sepsis, with, us, made, penicillin, produced, by, merck, co, half, of, the, total, supply, produced, at, the, time, was, used, on, that, one, patient, anne, miller, by, june, 1942, just, enough, us, penicillin, was, available, to, treat, ten, patients, in, july, 1943, the, war, production, board, drew, up, a, plan, for, the, mass, distribution, of, penicillin, stocks, to, allied, troops, fighting, in, europe, the, results, of, fermentation, research, on, corn, steep, liquor, at, the, nrrl, allowed, the, united, states, to, produce, 2, 3, million, doses, in, time, for, the, invasion, of, normandy, in, the, spring, of, 1944, after, a, worldwide, search, in, 1943, a, mouldy, cantaloupe, in, a, peoria, illinois, market, was, found, to, contain, the, best, strain, of, mould, for, production, using, the, corn, steep, liquor, process, pfizer, scientist, jasper, h, kane, suggested, using, a, deep, tank, fermentation, method, for, producing, large, quantities, of, pharmaceutical, grade, penicillin, 109, large, scale, production, resulted, from, the, development, of, a, deep, tank, fermentation, plant, by, chemical, engineer, margaret, hutchinson, rousseau, as, a, direct, result, of, the, war, and, the, war, production, board, by, june, 1945, over, 646, billion, units, per, year, were, being, produced, g, raymond, rettew, made, a, significant, contribution, to, the, american, war, effort, by, his, techniques, to, produce, commercial, quantities, of, penicillin, wherein, he, combined, his, knowledge, of, mushroom, spawn, with, the, function, of, the, sharples, cream, separator, by, 1943, rettew, s, lab, was, producing, most, of, the, world, s, penicillin, during, world, war, ii, penicillin, made, a, major, difference, in, the, number, of, deaths, and, amputations, caused, by, infected, wounds, among, allied, forces, saving, an, estimated, 12, 15, of, lives, availability, was, severely, limited, however, by, the, difficulty, of, manufacturing, large, quantities, of, penicillin, and, by, the, rapid, renal, clearance, of, the, drug, necessitating, frequent, dosing, methods, for, mass, production, of, penicillin, were, patented, by, andrew, jackson, moyer, in, 1945, florey, had, not, patented, penicillin, having, been, advised, by, sir, henry, dale, that, doing, so, would, be, unethical, penicillin, is, actively, excreted, and, about, 80, of, a, penicillin, dose, is, cleared, from, the, body, within, three, to, four, hours, of, administration, indeed, during, the, early, penicillin, era, the, drug, was, so, scarce, and, so, highly, valued, that, it, became, common, to, collect, the, urine, from, patients, being, treated, so, that, the, penicillin, in, the, urine, could, be, isolated, and, reused, this, was, not, a, satisfactory, solution, so, researchers, looked, for, a, way, to, slow, penicillin, excretion, they, hoped, to, find, a, molecule, that, could, compete, with, penicillin, for, the, organic, acid, transporter, responsible, for, excretion, such, that, the, transporter, would, preferentially, excrete, the, competing, molecule, and, the, penicillin, would, be, retained, the, uricosuric, agent, probenecid, proved, to, be, suitable, when, probenecid, and, penicillin, are, administered, together, probenecid, competitively, inhibits, the, excretion, of, penicillin, increasing, penicillin, s, concentration, and, prolonging, its, activity, eventually, the, advent, of, mass, production, techniques, and, semi, synthetic, penicillins, resolved, the, supply, issues, so, this, use, of, probenecid, declined, probenecid, is, still, useful, however, for, certain, infections, requiring, particularly, high, concentrations, of, penicillins, after, world, war, ii, australia, was, the, first, country, to, make, the, drug, available, for, civilian, use, in, the, u, s, penicillin, was, made, available, to, the, general, public, on, march, 15, 1945, fleming, florey, and, chain, shared, the, 1945, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, the, development, of, penicillin, the, chemical, structure, of, penicillin, was, first, proposed, by, edward, abraham, in, 1942, and, was, later, confirmed, in, 1945, using, x, ray, crystallography, by, dorothy, crowfoot, hodgkin, who, was, also, working, at, oxford, she, later, in, 1964, received, the, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, for, this, and, other, structure, determinations, chemist, john, c, sheehan, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, completed, the, first, chemical, synthesis, of, penicillin, in, 1957, sheehan, had, started, his, studies, into, penicillin, synthesis, in, 1948, and, during, these, investigations, developed, new, methods, for, the, synthesis, of, peptides, as, well, as, new, protecting, groups, groups, that, mask, the, reactivity, of, certain, functional, groups, although, the, initial, synthesis, developed, by, sheehan, was, not, appropriate, for, mass, production, of, penicillins, one, of, the, intermediate, compounds, in, sheehan, s, synthesis, was, 6, aminopenicillanic, acid, 6, apa, the, nucleus, of, penicillin, 6, apa, was, discovered, by, researchers, at, the, beecham, research, laboratories, later, the, beecham, group, in, surrey, in, 1957, published, in, 1959, attaching, different, groups, to, the, 6, apa, nucleus, of, penicillin, allowed, the, creation, of, new, forms, of, penicillins, which, are, more, versatile, and, better, in, activity, the, narrow, range, of, treatable, diseases, or, spectrum, of, activity, of, the, penicillins, along, with, the, poor, activity, of, the, orally, active, phenoxymethylpenicillin, led, to, the, search, for, derivatives, of, penicillin, that, could, treat, a, wider, range, of, infections, the, isolation, of, 6, apa, the, nucleus, of, penicillin, allowed, for, the, preparation, of, semisynthetic, penicillins, with, various, improvements, over, benzylpenicillin, bioavailability, spectrum, stability, tolerance, the, first, major, development, was, ampicillin, in, 1961, it, offered, a, broader, spectrum, of, activity, than, either, of, the, original, penicillins, further, development, yielded, lactamase, resistant, penicillins, including, flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and, methicillin, these, were, significant, for, their, activity, against, lactamase, producing, bacterial, species, but, were, ineffective, against, the, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, mrsa, strains, that, subsequently, emerged, another, development, of, the, line, of, true, penicillins, was, the, antipseudomonal, penicillins, such, as, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and, piperacillin, useful, for, their, activity, against, gram, negative, bacteria, however, the, usefulness, of, the, lactam, ring, was, such, that, related, antibiotics, including, the, mecillinams, the, carbapenems, and, most, important, the, cephalosporins, still, retain, it, at, the, center, of, their, structures, penicillin, is, produced, by, the, fermentation, of, various, types, of, sugar, by, the, fungus, penicillium, rubens, the, fermentation, process, produces, penicillin, as, a, secondary, metabolite, when, the, growth, of, the, fungus, is, inhibited, by, stress, the, biosynthetic, pathway, outlined, below, experiences, feedback, inhibition, involving, the, by, product, l, lysine, inhibiting, the, enzyme, homocitrate, synthase, the, penicillium, cells, are, grown, using, a, technique, called, fed, batch, culture, in, which, the, cells, are, constantly, subjected, to, stress, which, is, required, for, induction, of, penicillin, production, while, the, usage, of, glucose, as, a, carbon, source, represses, penicillin, biosynthesis, enzymes, lactose, does, not, exert, any, effect, and, alkaline, ph, levels, override, this, regulation, excess, phosphate, available, oxygen, and, usage, of, ammonium, as, a, nitrogen, source, repress, penicillin, production, while, methionine, can, act, as, a, sole, nitrogen, sulfur, source, with, stimulating, effects, the, biotechnological, method, of, directed, evolution, has, been, applied, to, produce, by, mutation, a, large, number, of, penicillium, strains, these, techniques, include, error, prone, pcr, dna, shuffling, itchy, and, strand, overlap, pcr, semisynthetic, penicillins, are, prepared, to, start, from, the, penicillin, nucleus, 6, apa, overall, there, are, three, main, and, important, steps, to, the, biosynthesis, of, penicillin, g, benzylpenicillin
