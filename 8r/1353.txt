cardiovascular, disease, cvd, is, any, disease, involving, the, heart, or, blood, vessels, cvds, constitute, a, class, of, diseases, that, includes, coronary, artery, diseases, e, g, angina, heart, attack, heart, failure, hypertensive, heart, disease, rheumatic, heart, disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, congenital, heart, disease, valvular, heart, disease, carditis, aortic, aneurysms, peripheral, artery, disease, thromboembolic, disease, and, venous, thrombosis, the, underlying, mechanisms, vary, depending, on, the, disease, it, is, estimated, that, dietary, risk, factors, are, associated, with, 53, of, cvd, deaths, coronary, artery, disease, stroke, and, peripheral, artery, disease, involve, atherosclerosis, this, may, be, caused, by, high, blood, pressure, smoking, diabetes, mellitus, lack, of, exercise, obesity, high, blood, cholesterol, poor, diet, excessive, alcohol, consumption, and, poor, sleep, among, other, things, high, blood, pressure, is, estimated, to, account, for, approximately, 13, of, cvd, deaths, while, tobacco, accounts, for, 9, diabetes, 6, lack, of, exercise, 6, and, obesity, 5, rheumatic, heart, disease, may, follow, untreated, strep, throat, it, is, estimated, that, up, to, 90, of, cvd, may, be, preventable, prevention, of, cvd, involves, improving, risk, factors, through, healthy, eating, exercise, avoidance, of, tobacco, smoke, and, limiting, alcohol, intake, treating, risk, factors, such, as, high, blood, pressure, blood, lipids, and, diabetes, is, also, beneficial, treating, people, who, have, strep, throat, with, antibiotics, can, decrease, the, risk, of, rheumatic, heart, disease, the, use, of, aspirin, in, people, who, are, otherwise, healthy, is, of, unclear, benefit, cardiovascular, diseases, are, the, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, except, africa, together, cvd, resulted, in, 17, 9, million, deaths, 32, 1, in, 2015, up, from, 12, 3, million, 25, 8, in, 1990, deaths, at, a, given, age, from, cvd, are, more, common, and, have, been, increasing, in, much, of, the, developing, world, while, rates, have, declined, in, most, of, the, developed, world, since, the, 1970s, coronary, artery, disease, and, stroke, account, for, 80, of, cvd, deaths, in, males, and, 75, of, cvd, deaths, in, females, most, cardiovascular, disease, affects, older, adults, in, the, united, states, 11, of, people, between, 20, and, 40, have, cvd, while, 37, between, 40, and, 60, 71, of, people, between, 60, and, 80, and, 85, of, people, over, 80, have, cvd, the, average, age, of, death, from, coronary, artery, disease, in, the, developed, world, is, around, 80, while, it, is, around, 68, in, the, developing, world, cvd, is, typically, diagnosed, seven, to, ten, years, earlier, in, men, than, in, women, 48, there, are, many, cardiovascular, diseases, involving, the, blood, vessels, they, are, known, as, vascular, diseases, there, are, also, many, cardiovascular, diseases, that, involve, the, heart, there, are, many, risk, factors, for, heart, diseases, age, sex, tobacco, use, physical, inactivity, non, alcoholic, fatty, liver, disease, excessive, alcohol, consumption, unhealthy, diet, obesity, genetic, predisposition, and, family, history, of, cardiovascular, disease, raised, blood, pressure, hypertension, raised, blood, sugar, diabetes, mellitus, raised, blood, cholesterol, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed, celiac, disease, psychosocial, factors, poverty, and, low, educational, status, air, pollution, and, poor, sleep, while, the, individual, contribution, of, each, risk, factor, varies, between, different, communities, or, ethnic, groups, the, overall, contribution, of, these, risk, factors, is, very, consistent, some, of, these, risk, factors, such, as, age, sex, or, family, history, genetic, predisposition, are, immutable, however, many, important, cardiovascular, risk, factors, are, modifiable, by, lifestyle, change, social, change, drug, treatment, for, example, prevention, of, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and, diabetes, people, with, obesity, are, at, increased, risk, of, atherosclerosis, of, the, coronary, arteries, cardiovascular, disease, in, a, person, s, parents, increases, their, risk, by, 3, fold, and, genetics, is, an, important, risk, factor, for, cardiovascular, diseases, genetic, cardiovascular, disease, can, occur, either, as, a, consequence, of, single, variant, mendelian, or, polygenic, influences, there, are, more, than, 40, inherited, cardiovascular, disease, that, can, be, traced, to, a, single, disease, causing, dna, variant, although, these, conditions, are, rare, most, common, cardiovascular, diseases, are, non, mendelian, and, are, thought, to, be, due, to, hundreds, or, thousands, of, genetic, variants, known, as, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, each, associated, with, a, small, effect, age, is, the, most, important, risk, factor, in, developing, cardiovascular, or, heart, diseases, with, approximately, a, tripling, of, risk, with, each, decade, of, life, coronary, fatty, streaks, can, begin, to, form, in, adolescence, it, is, estimated, that, 82, percent, of, people, who, die, of, coronary, heart, disease, are, 65, and, older, simultaneously, the, risk, of, stroke, doubles, every, decade, after, age, 55, multiple, explanations, are, proposed, to, explain, why, age, increases, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, heart, diseases, one, of, them, relates, to, serum, cholesterol, level, in, most, populations, the, serum, total, cholesterol, level, increases, as, age, increases, in, men, this, increase, levels, off, around, age, 45, to, 50, years, in, women, the, increase, continues, sharply, until, age, 60, to, 65, years, aging, is, also, associated, with, changes, in, the, mechanical, and, structural, properties, of, the, vascular, wall, which, leads, to, the, loss, of, arterial, elasticity, and, reduced, arterial, compliance, and, may, subsequently, lead, to, coronary, artery, disease, men, are, at, greater, risk, of, heart, disease, than, pre, menopausal, women, once, past, menopause, it, has, been, argued, that, a, woman, s, risk, is, similar, to, a, man, s, although, more, recent, data, from, the, who, and, un, disputes, this, if, a, female, has, diabetes, she, is, more, likely, to, develop, heart, disease, than, a, male, with, diabetes, women, who, have, high, blood, pressure, and, had, complications, in, their, pregnancy, have, three, times, the, risk, of, developing, cardiovascular, disease, compared, to, women, with, normal, blood, pressure, who, had, no, complications, in, pregnancy, coronary, heart, diseases, are, 2, to, 5, times, more, common, among, middle, aged, men, than, women, in, a, study, done, by, the, world, health, organization, sex, contributes, to, approximately, 40, of, the, variation, in, sex, ratios, of, coronary, heart, disease, mortality, another, study, reports, similar, results, finding, that, sex, differences, explains, nearly, half, the, risk, associated, with, cardiovascular, diseases, one, of, the, proposed, explanations, for, sex, differences, in, cardiovascular, diseases, is, hormonal, difference, among, women, estrogen, is, the, predominant, sex, hormone, estrogen, may, have, protective, effects, on, glucose, metabolism, and, hemostatic, system, and, may, have, direct, effect, in, improving, endothelial, cell, function, the, production, of, estrogen, decreases, after, menopause, and, this, may, change, the, female, lipid, metabolism, toward, a, more, atherogenic, form, by, decreasing, the, hdl, cholesterol, level, while, increasing, ldl, and, total, cholesterol, levels, among, men, and, women, there, are, differences, in, body, weight, height, body, fat, distribution, heart, rate, stroke, volume, and, arterial, compliance, in, the, very, elderly, age, related, large, artery, pulsatility, and, stiffness, are, more, pronounced, among, women, than, men, this, may, be, caused, by, the, women, s, smaller, body, size, and, arterial, dimensions, which, are, independent, of, menopause, cigarettes, are, the, major, form, of, smoked, tobacco, risks, to, health, from, tobacco, use, result, not, only, from, direct, consumption, of, tobacco, but, also, from, exposure, to, second, hand, smoke, approximately, 10, of, cardiovascular, disease, is, attributed, to, smoking, however, people, who, quit, smoking, by, age, 30, have, almost, as, low, a, risk, of, death, as, never, smokers, insufficient, physical, activity, defined, as, less, than, 5, x, 30, minutes, of, moderate, activity, per, week, or, less, than, 3, x, 20, minutes, of, vigorous, activity, per, week, is, currently, the, fourth, leading, risk, factor, for, mortality, worldwide, in, 2008, 31, 3, of, adults, aged, 15, or, older, 28, 2, men, and, 34, 4, women, were, insufficiently, physically, active, the, risk, of, ischemic, heart, disease, and, diabetes, mellitus, is, reduced, by, almost, a, third, in, adults, who, participate, in, 150, minutes, of, moderate, physical, activity, each, week, or, equivalent, in, addition, physical, activity, assists, weight, loss, and, improves, blood, glucose, control, blood, pressure, lipid, profile, and, insulin, sensitivity, these, effects, may, at, least, in, part, explain, its, cardiovascular, benefits, high, dietary, intakes, of, saturated, fat, trans, fats, and, salt, and, low, intake, of, fruits, vegetables, and, fish, are, linked, to, cardiovascular, risk, although, whether, all, these, associations, indicate, causes, is, disputed, the, world, health, organization, attributes, approximately, 1, 7, million, deaths, worldwide, to, low, fruit, and, vegetable, consumption, frequent, consumption, of, high, energy, foods, such, as, processed, foods, that, are, high, in, fats, and, sugars, promotes, obesity, and, may, increase, cardiovascular, risk, the, amount, of, dietary, salt, consumed, may, also, be, an, important, determinant, of, blood, pressure, levels, and, overall, cardiovascular, risk, there, is, moderate, quality, evidence, that, reducing, saturated, fat, intake, for, at, least, two, years, reduces, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, high, trans, fat, intake, has, adverse, effects, on, blood, lipids, and, circulating, inflammatory, markers, and, elimination, of, trans, fat, from, diets, has, been, widely, advocated, in, 2018, the, world, health, organization, estimated, that, trans, fats, were, the, cause, of, more, than, half, a, million, deaths, per, year, there, is, evidence, that, higher, consumption, of, sugar, is, associated, with, higher, blood, pressure, and, unfavorable, blood, lipids, and, sugar, intake, also, increases, the, risk, of, diabetes, mellitus, high, consumption, of, processed, meats, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, possibly, in, part, due, to, increased, dietary, salt, intake, the, relationship, between, alcohol, consumption, and, cardiovascular, disease, is, complex, and, may, depend, on, the, amount, of, alcohol, consumed, there, is, a, direct, relationship, between, high, levels, of, drinking, alcohol, and, cardiovascular, disease, drinking, at, low, levels, without, episodes, of, heavy, drinking, may, be, associated, with, a, reduced, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, but, there, is, evidence, that, associations, between, moderate, alcohol, consumption, and, protection, from, stroke, are, non, causal, at, the, population, level, the, health, risks, of, drinking, alcohol, exceed, any, potential, benefits, untreated, celiac, disease, can, cause, the, development, of, many, types, of, cardiovascular, diseases, most, of, which, improve, or, resolve, with, a, gluten, free, diet, and, intestinal, healing, however, delays, in, recognition, and, diagnosis, of, celiac, disease, can, cause, irreversible, heart, damage, a, lack, of, good, sleep, in, amount, or, quality, is, documented, as, increasing, cardiovascular, risk, in, both, adults, and, teens, recommendations, suggest, that, infants, typically, need, 12, or, more, hours, of, sleep, per, day, adolescent, at, least, eight, or, nine, hours, and, adults, seven, or, eight, about, one, third, of, adult, americans, get, less, than, the, recommended, seven, hours, of, sleep, per, night, and, in, a, study, of, teenagers, just, 2, 2, percent, of, those, studied, got, enough, sleep, many, of, whom, did, not, get, good, quality, sleep, studies, have, shown, that, short, sleepers, getting, less, than, seven, hours, sleep, per, night, have, a, 10, percent, to, 30, percent, higher, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, sleep, disorders, such, as, sleep, disordered, breathing, and, insomnia, are, also, associated, with, a, higher, cardiometabolic, risk, an, estimated, 50, to, 70, million, americans, have, insomnia, sleep, apnea, or, other, chronic, sleep, disorders, in, addition, sleep, research, displays, differences, in, race, and, class, short, sleep, and, poor, sleep, tend, to, be, more, frequently, reported, in, ethnic, minorities, than, in, whites, african, americans, report, experiencing, short, durations, of, sleep, five, times, more, often, than, whites, possibly, as, a, result, of, social, and, environmental, factors, black, children, and, children, living, in, disadvantaged, neighborhoods, have, much, higher, rates, of, sleep, apnea, cardiovascular, disease, has, a, greater, impact, on, low, and, middle, income, countries, compared, to, those, with, higher, income, although, data, on, the, social, patterns, of, cardiovascular, disease, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, is, limited, reports, from, high, income, countries, consistently, demonstrate, that, low, educational, status, or, income, are, associated, with, a, greater, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, policies, that, have, resulted, in, increased, socio, economic, inequalities, have, been, associated, with, greater, subsequent, socio, economic, differences, in, cardiovascular, disease, implying, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, psychosocial, factors, environmental, exposures, health, behaviours, and, health, care, access, and, quality, contribute, to, socio, economic, differentials, in, cardiovascular, disease, the, commission, on, social, determinants, of, health, recommended, that, more, equal, distributions, of, power, wealth, education, housing, environmental, factors, nutrition, and, health, care, were, needed, to, address, inequalities, in, cardiovascular, disease, and, non, communicable, diseases, particulate, matter, has, been, studied, for, its, short, and, long, term, exposure, effects, on, cardiovascular, disease, currently, airborne, particles, under, 2, 5, micrometers, in, diameter, pm, 2, 5, are, the, major, focus, in, which, gradients, are, used, to, determine, cvd, risk, overall, long, term, pm, exposure, increased, rate, of, atherosclerosis, and, inflammation, in, regards, to, short, term, exposure, 2, hours, every, 25, g, m, 3, of, pm, 2, 5, resulted, in, a, 48, increase, of, cvd, mortality, risk, in, addition, after, only, 5, days, of, exposure, a, rise, in, systolic, 2, 8, mmhg, and, diastolic, 2, 7, mmhg, blood, pressure, occurred, for, every, 10, 5, g, m, 3, of, pm, 2, 5, other, research, has, implicated, pm, 2, 5, in, irregular, heart, rhythm, reduced, heart, rate, variability, decreased, vagal, tone, and, most, notably, heart, failure, pm, 2, 5, is, also, linked, to, carotid, artery, thickening, and, increased, risk, of, acute, myocardial, infarction, existing, cardiovascular, disease, or, a, previous, cardiovascular, event, such, as, a, heart, attack, or, stroke, is, the, strongest, predictor, of, a, future, cardiovascular, event, age, sex, smoking, blood, pressure, blood, lipids, and, diabetes, are, important, predictors, of, future, cardiovascular, disease, in, people, who, are, not, known, to, have, cardiovascular, disease, these, measures, and, sometimes, others, may, be, combined, into, composite, risk, scores, to, estimate, an, individual, s, future, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, numerous, risk, scores, exist, although, their, respective, merits, are, debated, other, diagnostic, tests, and, biomarkers, remain, under, evaluation, but, currently, these, lack, clear, cut, evidence, to, support, their, routine, use, they, include, family, history, coronary, artery, calcification, score, high, sensitivity, c, reactive, protein, hs, crp, ankle, brachial, pressure, index, lipoprotein, subclasses, and, particle, concentration, lipoprotein, a, apolipoproteins, a, i, and, b, fibrinogen, white, blood, cell, count, homocysteine, n, terminal, pro, b, type, natriuretic, peptide, nt, probnp, and, markers, of, kidney, function, high, blood, phosphorus, is, also, linked, to, an, increased, risk, there, is, evidence, that, mental, health, problems, in, particular, depression, and, traumatic, stress, is, linked, to, cardiovascular, diseases, whereas, mental, health, problems, are, known, to, be, associated, with, risk, factors, for, cardiovascular, diseases, such, as, smoking, poor, diet, and, a, sedentary, lifestyle, these, factors, alone, do, not, explain, the, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, seen, in, depression, stress, and, anxiety, moreover, posttraumatic, stress, disorder, is, independently, associated, with, increased, risk, for, incident, coronary, heart, disease, even, after, adjusting, for, depression, and, other, covariates, little, is, known, about, the, relationship, between, work, and, cardiovascular, disease, but, links, have, been, established, between, certain, toxins, extreme, heat, and, cold, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, and, mental, health, concerns, such, as, stress, and, depression, a, 2015, sbu, report, looking, at, non, chemical, factors, found, an, association, for, those, specifically, the, risk, of, stroke, was, also, increased, by, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, hypertension, develops, more, often, in, those, who, experience, job, strain, and, who, have, shift, work, differences, between, women, and, men, in, risk, are, small, however, men, risk, having, and, dying, of, heart, attacks, or, stroke, twice, as, often, as, women, during, working, life, a, 2017, sbu, report, found, evidence, that, workplace, exposure, to, silica, dust, engine, exhaust, or, welding, fumes, is, associated, with, heart, disease, associations, also, exist, for, exposure, to, arsenic, benzopyrenes, lead, dynamite, carbon, disulphide, carbon, monoxide, metalworking, fluids, and, occupational, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, working, with, the, electrolytic, production, of, aluminium, or, the, production, of, paper, when, the, sulphate, pulping, process, is, used, is, associated, with, heart, disease, an, association, was, also, found, between, heart, disease, and, exposure, to, compounds, which, are, no, longer, permitted, in, certain, work, environments, such, as, phenoxy, acids, containing, tcdd, dioxin, or, asbestos, workplace, exposure, to, silica, dust, or, asbestos, is, also, associated, with, pulmonary, heart, disease, there, is, evidence, that, workplace, exposure, to, lead, carbon, disulphide, phenoxyacids, containing, tcdd, as, well, as, working, in, an, environment, where, aluminum, is, being, electrolytically, produced, is, associated, with, stroke, as, of, 2017, evidence, suggests, that, certain, leukemia, associated, mutations, in, blood, cells, may, also, lead, to, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, several, large, scale, research, projects, looking, at, human, genetic, data, have, found, a, robust, link, between, the, presence, of, these, mutations, a, condition, known, as, clonal, hematopoiesis, and, cardiovascular, disease, related, incidents, and, mortality, radiation, treatments, rt, for, cancer, can, increase, the, risk, of, heart, disease, and, death, as, observed, in, breast, cancer, therapy, therapeutic, radiation, increases, the, risk, of, a, subsequent, heart, attack, or, stroke, by, 1, 5, to, 4, times, the, increase, depends, on, the, dose, strength, volume, and, location, use, of, concomitant, chemotherapy, e, g, anthracyclines, is, an, aggravating, risk, factor, the, occurrence, rate, of, rt, induced, cardiovascular, disease, is, estimated, between, 10, and, 30, side, effects, from, radiation, therapy, for, cardiovascular, diseases, have, been, termed, radiation, induced, heart, disease, or, radiation, induced, cardiovascular, disease, symptoms, are, dose, dependent, and, include, cardiomyopathy, myocardial, fibrosis, valvular, heart, disease, coronary, artery, disease, heart, arrhythmia, and, peripheral, artery, disease, radiation, induced, fibrosis, vascular, cell, damage, and, oxidative, stress, can, lead, to, these, and, other, late, side, effect, symptoms, population, based, studies, show, that, atherosclerosis, the, major, precursor, of, cardiovascular, disease, begins, in, childhood, the, pathobiological, determinants, of, atherosclerosis, in, youth, pday, study, demonstrated, that, intimal, lesions, appear, in, all, the, aortas, and, more, than, half, of, the, right, coronary, arteries, of, youths, aged, 7, 9, years, obesity, and, diabetes, mellitus, are, linked, to, cardiovascular, disease, as, are, a, history, of, chronic, kidney, disease, and, hypercholesterolaemia, in, fact, cardiovascular, disease, is, the, most, life, threatening, of, the, diabetic, complications, and, diabetics, are, two, to, four, fold, more, likely, to, die, of, cardiovascular, related, causes, than, nondiabetics, screening, ecgs, either, at, rest, or, with, exercise, are, not, recommended, in, those, without, symptoms, who, are, at, low, risk, this, includes, those, who, are, young, without, risk, factors, in, those, at, higher, risk, the, evidence, for, screening, with, ecgs, is, inconclusive, additionally, echocardiography, myocardial, perfusion, imaging, and, cardiac, stress, testing, is, not, recommended, in, those, at, low, risk, who, do, not, have, symptoms, some, biomarkers, may, add, to, conventional, cardiovascular, risk, factors, in, predicting, the, risk, of, future, cardiovascular, disease, however, the, value, of, some, biomarkers, is, questionable, ankle, brachial, index, abi, high, sensitivity, c, reactive, protein, hscrp, and, coronary, artery, calcium, are, also, of, unclear, benefit, in, those, without, symptoms, as, of, 2018, the, nih, recommends, lipid, testing, in, children, beginning, at, the, age, of, 2, if, there, is, a, family, history, of, heart, disease, or, lipid, problems, it, is, hoped, that, early, testing, will, improve, lifestyle, factors, in, those, at, risk, such, as, diet, and, exercise, screening, and, selection, for, primary, prevention, interventions, has, traditionally, been, done, through, absolute, risk, using, a, variety, of, scores, ex, framingham, or, reynolds, risk, scores, this, stratification, has, separated, people, who, receive, the, lifestyle, interventions, generally, lower, and, intermediate, risk, from, the, medication, higher, risk, the, number, and, variety, of, risk, scores, available, for, use, has, multiplied, but, their, efficacy, according, to, a, 2016, review, was, unclear, due, to, lack, of, external, validation, or, impact, analysis, risk, stratification, models, often, lack, sensitivity, for, population, groups, and, do, not, account, for, the, large, number, of, negative, events, among, the, intermediate, and, low, risk, groups, as, a, result, future, preventative, screening, appears, to, shift, toward, applying, prevention, according, to, randomized, trial, results, of, each, intervention, rather, than, large, scale, risk, assessment, up, to, 90, of, cardiovascular, disease, may, be, preventable, if, established, risk, factors, are, avoided, currently, practised, measures, to, prevent, cardiovascular, disease, include, most, guidelines, recommend, combining, preventive, strategies, there, is, some, evidence, that, interventions, aiming, to, reduce, more, than, one, cardiovascular, risk, factor, may, have, beneficial, effects, on, blood, pressure, body, mass, index, and, waist, circumference, however, evidence, was, limited, and, the, authors, were, unable, to, draw, firm, conclusions, on, the, effects, on, cardiovascular, events, and, mortality, there, is, additional, evidence, to, suggest, that, providing, people, with, a, cardiovascular, disease, risk, score, may, reduce, risk, factors, by, a, small, amount, compared, to, usual, care, however, there, was, some, uncertainty, as, to, whether, providing, these, scores, had, any, effect, on, cardiovascular, disease, events, it, is, unclear, whether, or, not, dental, care, in, those, with, periodontitis, affects, their, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, according, to, a, 2021, who, study, working, 55, hours, a, week, raises, the, risk, of, stroke, by, 35, and, the, risk, of, dying, from, heart, conditions, by, 17, when, compared, to, a, 35, 40, hours, week, a, diet, high, in, fruits, and, vegetables, decreases, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, death, a, 2021, review, found, that, plant, based, diets, can, provide, a, risk, reduction, for, cvd, if, a, healthy, plant, based, diet, is, consumed, unhealthy, plant, based, diets, do, not, provide, benefits, over, diets, including, meat, a, similar, meta, analysis, and, systematic, review, also, looked, into, dietary, patterns, and, found, that, diets, lower, in, animal, foods, and, unhealthy, plant, foods, and, higher, in, healthy, plant, foods, are, beneficial, for, cvd, prevention, a, 2018, meta, analysis, of, observational, studies, concluded, that, in, most, countries, a, vegan, diet, is, associated, with, a, more, favourable, cardio, metabolic, profile, compared, to, an, omnivorous, diet, evidence, suggests, that, the, mediterranean, diet, may, improve, cardiovascular, outcomes, there, is, also, evidence, that, a, mediterranean, diet, may, be, more, effective, than, a, low, fat, diet, in, bringing, about, long, term, changes, to, cardiovascular, risk, factors, e, g, lower, cholesterol, level, and, blood, pressure, the, dash, diet, high, in, nuts, fish, fruits, and, vegetables, and, low, in, sweets, red, meat, and, fat, has, been, shown, to, reduce, blood, pressure, lower, total, and, low, density, lipoprotein, cholesterol, and, improve, metabolic, syndrome, but, the, long, term, benefits, have, been, questioned, a, high, fiber, diet, is, associated, with, lower, risks, of, cardiovascular, disease, worldwide, dietary, guidelines, recommend, a, reduction, in, saturated, fat, and, although, the, role, of, dietary, fat, in, cardiovascular, disease, is, complex, and, controversial, there, is, a, long, standing, consensus, that, replacing, saturated, fat, with, unsaturated, fat, in, the, diet, is, sound, medical, advice, total, fat, intake, has, not, been, found, to, be, associated, with, cardiovascular, risk, a, 2020, systematic, review, found, moderate, quality, evidence, that, reducing, saturated, fat, intake, for, at, least, 2, years, caused, a, reduction, in, cardiovascular, events, a, 2015, meta, analysis, of, observational, studies, however, did, not, find, a, convincing, association, between, saturated, fat, intake, and, cardiovascular, disease, variation, in, what, is, used, as, a, substitute, for, saturated, fat, may, explain, some, differences, in, findings, the, benefit, from, replacement, with, polyunsaturated, fats, appears, greatest, while, replacement, of, saturated, fats, with, carbohydrates, does, not, appear, to, have, a, beneficial, effect, a, diet, high, in, trans, fatty, acids, is, associated, with, higher, rates, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, in, 2015, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, determined, that, there, was, no, longer, a, consensus, among, qualified, experts, that, partially, hydrogenated, oils, phos, which, are, the, primary, dietary, source, of, industrially, produced, trans, fatty, acids, ip, tfa, are, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, for, any, use, in, human, food, there, is, conflicting, evidence, concerning, whether, dietary, supplements, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, a, type, of, polyunsaturated, essential, fatty, acid, added, to, diet, improve, cardiovascular, risk, the, benefits, of, recommending, a, low, salt, diet, in, people, with, high, or, normal, blood, pressure, are, not, clear, in, those, with, heart, failure, after, one, study, was, left, out, the, rest, of, the, trials, show, a, trend, to, benefit, another, review, of, dietary, salt, concluded, that, there, is, strong, evidence, that, high, dietary, salt, intake, increases, blood, pressure, and, worsens, hypertension, and, that, it, increases, the, number, of, cardiovascular, disease, events, both, as, a, result, of, the, increased, blood, pressure, and, probably, through, other, mechanisms, moderate, evidence, was, found, that, high, salt, intake, increases, cardiovascular, mortality, and, some, evidence, was, found, for, an, increase, in, overall, mortality, strokes, and, left, ventricular, hypertrophy, overall, the, current, body, of, scientific, evidence, is, uncertain, on, whether, intermittent, fasting, could, prevent, cardiovascular, disease, intermittent, fasting, may, help, people, lose, more, weight, than, regular, eating, patterns, but, was, not, different, from, energy, restriction, diets, blood, pressure, medication, reduces, cardiovascular, disease, in, people, at, risk, irrespective, of, age, the, baseline, level, of, cardiovascular, risk, or, baseline, blood, pressure, the, commonly, used, drug, regimens, have, similar, efficacy, in, reducing, the, risk, of, all, major, cardiovascular, events, although, there, may, be, differences, between, drugs, in, their, ability, to, prevent, specific, outcomes, larger, reductions, in, blood, pressure, produce, larger, reductions, in, risk, and, most, people, with, high, blood, pressure, require, more, than, one, drug, to, achieve, adequate, reduction, in, blood, pressure, adherence, to, medications, is, often, poor, and, while, mobile, phone, text, messaging, has, been, tried, to, improve, adherence, there, is, insufficient, evidence, that, it, alters, secondary, prevention, of, cardiovascular, disease, statins, are, effective, in, preventing, further, cardiovascular, disease, in, people, with, a, history, of, cardiovascular, disease, as, the, event, rate, is, higher, in, men, than, in, women, the, decrease, in, events, is, more, easily, seen, in, men, than, women, in, those, at, risk, but, without, a, history, of, cardiovascular, disease, primary, prevention, statins, decrease, the, risk, of, death, and, combined, fatal, and, non, fatal, cardiovascular, disease, the, benefit, however, is, small, a, united, states, guideline, recommends, statins, in, those, who, have, a, 12, or, greater, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, over, the, next, ten, years, niacin, fibrates, and, cetp, inhibitors, while, they, may, increase, hdl, cholesterol, do, not, affect, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, in, those, who, are, already, on, statins, fibrates, lower, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, and, coronary, events, but, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, they, reduce, all, cause, mortality, anti, diabetic, medication, may, reduce, cardiovascular, risk, in, people, with, type, 2, diabetes, although, evidence, is, not, conclusive, a, meta, analysis, in, 2009, including, 27, 049, participants, and, 2, 370, major, vascular, events, showed, a, 15, relative, risk, reduction, in, cardiovascular, disease, with, more, intensive, glucose, lowering, over, an, average, follow, up, period, of, 4, 4, years, but, an, increased, risk, of, major, hypoglycemia, aspirin, has, been, found, to, be, of, only, modest, benefit, in, those, at, low, risk, of, heart, disease, as, the, risk, of, serious, bleeding, is, almost, equal, to, the, protection, against, cardiovascular, problems, in, those, at, very, low, risk, including, those, over, the, age, of, 70, it, is, not, recommended, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, recommends, against, use, of, aspirin, for, prevention, in, women, less, than, 55, and, men, less, than, 45, years, old, however, it, is, recommended, for, some, older, people, the, use, of, vasoactive, agents, for, people, with, pulmonary, hypertension, with, left, heart, disease, or, hypoxemic, lung, diseases, may, cause, harm, and, unnecessary, expense, antibiotics, for, secondary, prevention, of, coronary, heart, disease, antibiotics, may, help, patients, with, coronary, disease, to, reduce, the, risk, of, heart, attacks, and, strokes, however, evidence, in, 2021, suggests, that, antibiotics, for, secondary, prevention, of, coronary, heart, disease, are, harmful, with, increased, mortality, and, occurrence, of, stroke, the, use, of, antibiotics, is, not, supported, for, preventing, secondary, coronary, heart, disease, exercise, based, cardiac, rehabilitation, following, a, heart, attack, reduces, the, risk, of, death, from, cardiovascular, disease, and, leads, to, less, hospitalizations, there, have, been, few, high, quality, studies, of, the, benefits, of, exercise, training, in, people, with, increased, cardiovascular, risk, but, no, history, of, cardiovascular, disease, a, systematic, review, estimated, that, inactivity, is, responsible, for, 6, of, the, burden, of, disease, from, coronary, heart, disease, worldwide, the, authors, estimated, that, 121, 000, deaths, from, coronary, heart, disease, could, have, been, averted, in, europe, in, 2008, if, people, had, not, been, physically, inactive, low, quality, evidence, from, a, limited, number, of, studies, suggest, that, yoga, has, beneficial, effects, on, blood, pressure, and, cholesterol, tentative, evidence, suggests, that, home, based, exercise, programs, may, be, more, efficient, at, improving, exercise, adherence, while, a, healthy, diet, is, beneficial, the, effect, of, antioxidant, supplementation, vitamin, e, vitamin, c, etc, or, vitamins, has, not, been, shown, to, protect, against, cardiovascular, disease, and, in, some, cases, may, possibly, result, in, harm, mineral, supplements, have, also, not, been, found, to, be, useful, niacin, a, type, of, vitamin, b3, may, be, an, exception, with, a, modest, decrease, in, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, events, in, those, at, high, risk, magnesium, supplementation, lowers, high, blood, pressure, in, a, dose, dependent, manner, magnesium, therapy, is, recommended, for, people, with, ventricular, arrhythmia, associated, with, torsades, de, pointes, who, present, with, long, qt, syndrome, and, for, the, treatment, of, people, with, digoxin, intoxication, induced, arrhythmias, there, is, no, evidence, that, omega, 3, fatty, acid, supplementation, is, beneficial, a, 2022, review, found, that, some, dietary, supplements, including, micronutrients, may, reduce, risk, factors, for, cardiovascular, disease, cardiovascular, disease, is, treatable, with, initial, treatment, primarily, focused, on, diet, and, lifestyle, interventions, influenza, may, make, heart, attacks, and, strokes, more, likely, and, therefore, influenza, vaccination, may, decrease, the, chance, of, cardiovascular, events, and, death, in, people, with, heart, disease, proper, cvd, management, necessitates, a, focus, on, mi, and, stroke, cases, due, to, their, combined, high, mortality, rate, keeping, in, mind, the, cost, effectiveness, of, any, intervention, especially, in, developing, countries, with, low, or, middle, income, levels, regarding, mi, strategies, using, aspirin, atenolol, streptokinase, or, tissue, plasminogen, activator, have, been, compared, for, quality, adjusted, life, year, qaly, in, regions, of, low, and, middle, income, the, costs, for, a, single, qaly, for, aspirin, and, atenolol, were, less, than, us, 25, streptokinase, was, about, 680, and, t, pa, was, 16, 000, aspirin, ace, inhibitors, beta, blockers, and, statins, used, together, for, secondary, cvd, prevention, in, the, same, regions, showed, single, qaly, costs, of, 350, there, are, also, surgical, or, procedural, interventions, that, can, save, someone, s, life, or, prolong, it, for, heart, valve, problems, a, person, could, have, surgery, to, replace, the, valve, for, arrhythmias, a, pacemaker, can, be, put, in, place, to, help, reduce, abnormal, heart, rhythms, and, for, a, heart, attack, there, are, multiple, options, two, of, these, are, a, coronary, angioplasty, and, a, coronary, artery, bypass, surgery, there, is, probably, no, additional, benefit, in, terms, of, mortality, and, serious, adverse, events, when, blood, pressure, targets, were, lowered, to, 135, 85, mmhg, from, 140, to, 160, 90, to, 100, mmhg, cardiovascular, diseases, are, the, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, and, in, all, regions, except, africa, in, 2008, 30, of, all, global, death, was, attributed, to, cardiovascular, diseases, death, caused, by, cardiovascular, diseases, are, also, higher, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, as, over, 80, of, all, global, deaths, caused, by, cardiovascular, diseases, occurred, in, those, countries, it, is, also, estimated, that, by, 2030, over, 23, million, people, will, die, from, cardiovascular, diseases, each, year, it, is, estimated, that, 60, of, the, world, s, cardiovascular, disease, burden, will, occur, in, the, south, asian, subcontinent, despite, only, accounting, for, 20, of, the, world, s, population, this, may, be, secondary, to, a, combination, of, genetic, predisposition, and, environmental, factors, organizations, such, as, the, indian, heart, association, are, working, with, the, world, heart, federation, to, raise, awareness, about, this, issue, there, is, evidence, that, cardiovascular, disease, existed, in, pre, history, and, research, into, cardiovascular, disease, dates, from, at, least, the, 18th, century, the, causes, prevention, and, or, treatment, of, all, forms, of, cardiovascular, disease, remain, active, fields, of, biomedical, research, with, hundreds, of, scientific, studies, being, published, on, a, weekly, basis, recent, areas, of, research, include, the, link, between, inflammation, and, atherosclerosis, the, potential, for, novel, therapeutic, interventions, and, the, genetics, of, coronary, heart, disease
