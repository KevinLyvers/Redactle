partial, list, amphibians, are, ectothermic, anamniotic, four, limbed, vertebrate, animals, that, constitute, the, class, amphibia, in, its, broadest, sense, it, is, a, paraphyletic, group, encompassing, all, tetrapods, excluding, the, amniotes, tetrapods, with, an, amniotic, membrane, such, as, modern, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, all, extant, living, amphibians, belong, to, the, monophyletic, subclass, lissamphibia, with, three, living, orders, anura, frogs, and, toads, urodela, salamanders, and, gymnophiona, caecilians, evolved, to, be, mostly, semiaquatic, amphibians, have, adapted, to, inhabit, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, with, most, species, living, in, freshwater, wetland, or, terrestrial, ecosystems, such, as, riparian, woodland, fossorial, and, even, arboreal, habitats, their, life, cycle, typically, starts, out, as, aquatic, larvae, with, gills, known, as, tadpoles, but, some, species, have, developed, behavioural, adaptations, to, bypass, this, young, amphibians, generally, undergo, metamorphosis, from, an, aquatic, larval, form, with, gills, to, an, air, breathing, adult, form, with, lungs, amphibians, use, their, skin, as, a, secondary, respiratory, interface, and, some, small, terrestrial, salamanders, and, frogs, lack, lungs, and, rely, entirely, on, their, skin, they, are, superficially, similar, to, reptiles, like, lizards, but, unlike, reptiles, and, other, amniotes, require, access, to, water, bodies, to, breed, with, their, complex, reproductive, needs, and, permeable, skins, amphibians, are, often, ecological, indicators, to, habitat, conditions, in, recent, decades, there, has, been, a, dramatic, decline, in, amphibian, populations, for, many, species, around, the, globe, the, earliest, amphibians, evolved, in, the, devonian, period, from, tetrapodomorph, sarcopterygians, lobe, finned, fish, with, articulated, limb, like, fins, that, evolved, primitive, lungs, which, were, helpful, in, adapting, to, dry, land, they, diversified, and, became, ecologically, dominant, during, the, carboniferous, and, permian, periods, but, were, later, displaced, in, terrestrial, environments, by, early, reptiles, and, basal, synapsids, predecessors, of, mammals, the, origin, of, modern, lissamphibians, which, first, appeared, during, the, early, triassic, around, 250, million, years, ago, has, long, been, contentious, the, most, popular, hypothesis, is, that, they, likely, originated, from, temnospondyls, the, most, diverse, group, of, prehistoric, amphibians, during, the, permian, period, another, hypothesis, is, that, they, emerged, from, lepospondys, a, fourth, group, of, lissamphibians, the, albanerpetontidae, became, extinct, around, 2, million, years, ago, the, number, of, known, amphibian, species, is, approximately, 8, 000, of, which, nearly, 90, are, frogs, the, smallest, amphibian, and, vertebrate, in, the, world, is, a, frog, from, new, guinea, paedophryne, amauensis, with, a, length, of, just, 7, 7, mm, 0, 30, in, the, largest, living, amphibian, is, the, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, south, china, giant, salamander, andrias, sligoi, but, this, is, dwarfed, by, prehistoric, temnospondyls, such, as, mastodonsaurus, which, could, reach, up, to, 6, m, 20, ft, in, length, the, study, of, amphibians, is, called, batrachology, while, the, study, of, both, reptiles, and, amphibians, is, called, herpetology, the, word, amphibian, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, term, amph, bios, which, means, both, kinds, of, life, meaning, of, both, kinds, and, meaning, life, the, term, was, initially, used, as, a, general, adjective, for, animals, that, could, live, on, land, or, in, water, including, seals, and, otters, traditionally, the, class, amphibia, includes, all, tetrapod, vertebrates, that, are, not, amniotes, amphibia, in, its, widest, sense, sensu, lato, was, divided, into, three, subclasses, two, of, which, are, extinct, these, three, subclasses, do, not, include, all, extinct, amphibians, other, extinct, amphibian, groups, include, embolomeri, late, paleozoic, large, aquatic, predators, seymouriamorpha, semiaquatic, to, terrestrial, permian, forms, related, to, amniotes, among, others, names, such, as, tetrapoda, and, stegocephalia, encompass, the, entirety, of, amphibian, grade, tetrapods, while, reptiliomorpha, or, anthracosauria, are, variably, used, to, describe, extinct, amphibians, more, closely, related, to, amniotes, than, to, lissamphibians, the, actual, number, of, species, in, each, group, depends, on, the, taxonomic, classification, followed, the, two, most, common, systems, are, the, classification, adopted, by, the, website, amphibiaweb, university, of, california, berkeley, and, the, classification, by, herpetologist, darrel, frost, and, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, available, as, the, online, reference, database, amphibian, species, of, the, world, the, numbers, of, species, cited, above, follows, frost, and, the, total, number, of, known, living, amphibian, species, as, of, march, 31, 2019, is, exactly, 8, 000, of, which, nearly, 90, are, frogs, with, the, phylogenetic, classification, the, taxon, labyrinthodontia, has, been, discarded, as, it, is, a, polyparaphyletic, group, without, unique, defining, features, apart, from, shared, primitive, characteristics, classification, varies, according, to, the, preferred, phylogeny, of, the, author, and, whether, they, use, a, stem, based, or, a, node, based, classification, traditionally, amphibians, as, a, class, are, defined, as, all, tetrapods, with, a, larval, stage, while, the, group, that, includes, the, common, ancestors, of, all, living, amphibians, frogs, salamanders, and, caecilians, and, all, their, descendants, is, called, lissamphibia, the, phylogeny, of, paleozoic, amphibians, is, uncertain, and, lissamphibia, may, possibly, fall, within, extinct, groups, like, the, temnospondyli, traditionally, placed, in, the, subclass, labyrinthodontia, or, the, lepospondyli, and, in, some, analyses, even, in, the, amniotes, this, means, that, advocates, of, phylogenetic, nomenclature, have, removed, a, large, number, of, basal, devonian, and, carboniferous, amphibian, type, tetrapod, groups, that, were, formerly, placed, in, amphibia, in, linnaean, taxonomy, and, included, them, elsewhere, under, cladistic, taxonomy, if, the, common, ancestor, of, amphibians, and, amniotes, is, included, in, amphibia, it, becomes, a, paraphyletic, group, all, modern, amphibians, are, included, in, the, subclass, lissamphibia, which, is, usually, considered, a, clade, a, group, of, species, that, have, evolved, from, a, common, ancestor, the, three, modern, orders, are, anura, the, frogs, caudata, or, urodela, the, salamanders, and, gymnophiona, or, apoda, the, caecilians, it, has, been, suggested, that, salamanders, arose, separately, from, a, temnospondyl, like, ancestor, and, even, that, caecilians, are, the, sister, group, of, the, advanced, reptiliomorph, amphibians, and, thus, of, amniotes, although, the, fossils, of, several, older, proto, frogs, with, primitive, characteristics, are, known, the, oldest, true, frog, with, hopping, adaptations, is, prosalirus, bitis, from, the, early, jurassic, kayenta, formation, of, arizona, it, is, anatomically, very, similar, to, modern, frogs, the, oldest, known, caecilians, are, funcusvermis, gilmorei, from, the, late, triassic, and, eocaecilia, micropodia, from, the, early, jurassic, both, from, arizona, the, earliest, salamander, is, beiyanerpeton, jianpingensis, from, the, late, jurassic, of, northeastern, china, authorities, disagree, as, to, whether, salientia, is, a, superorder, that, includes, the, order, anura, or, whether, anura, is, a, sub, order, of, the, order, salientia, the, lissamphibia, are, traditionally, divided, into, three, orders, but, an, extinct, salamander, like, family, the, albanerpetontidae, is, now, considered, part, of, lissamphibia, alongside, the, superorder, salientia, furthermore, salientia, includes, all, three, recent, orders, plus, the, triassic, proto, frog, triadobatrachus, the, first, major, groups, of, amphibians, developed, in, the, devonian, period, around, 370, million, years, ago, from, lobe, finned, fish, which, were, similar, to, the, modern, coelacanth, and, lungfish, these, ancient, lobe, finned, fish, had, evolved, multi, jointed, leg, like, fins, with, digits, that, enabled, them, to, crawl, along, the, sea, bottom, some, fish, had, developed, primitive, lungs, that, help, them, breathe, air, when, the, stagnant, pools, of, the, devonian, swamps, were, low, in, oxygen, they, could, also, use, their, strong, fins, to, hoist, themselves, out, of, the, water, and, onto, dry, land, if, circumstances, so, required, eventually, their, bony, fins, would, evolve, into, limbs, and, they, would, become, the, ancestors, to, all, tetrapods, including, modern, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, despite, being, able, to, crawl, on, land, many, of, these, prehistoric, tetrapodomorph, fish, still, spent, most, of, their, time, in, the, water, they, had, started, to, develop, lungs, but, still, breathed, predominantly, with, gills, many, examples, of, species, showing, transitional, features, have, been, discovered, ichthyostega, was, one, of, the, first, primitive, amphibians, with, nostrils, and, more, efficient, lungs, it, had, four, sturdy, limbs, a, neck, a, tail, with, fins, and, a, skull, very, similar, to, that, of, the, lobe, finned, fish, eusthenopteron, amphibians, evolved, adaptations, that, allowed, them, to, stay, out, of, the, water, for, longer, periods, their, lungs, improved, and, their, skeletons, became, heavier, and, stronger, better, able, to, support, the, weight, of, their, bodies, on, land, they, developed, hands, and, feet, with, five, or, more, digits, the, skin, became, more, capable, of, retaining, body, fluids, and, resisting, desiccation, the, fish, s, hyomandibula, bone, in, the, hyoid, region, behind, the, gills, diminished, in, size, and, became, the, stapes, of, the, amphibian, ear, an, adaptation, necessary, for, hearing, on, dry, land, an, affinity, between, the, amphibians, and, the, teleost, fish, is, the, multi, folded, structure, of, the, teeth, and, the, paired, supra, occipital, bones, at, the, back, of, the, head, neither, of, these, features, being, found, elsewhere, in, the, animal, kingdom, at, the, end, of, the, devonian, period, 360, million, years, ago, the, seas, rivers, and, lakes, were, teeming, with, life, while, the, land, was, the, realm, of, early, plants, and, devoid, of, vertebrates, though, some, such, as, ichthyostega, may, have, sometimes, hauled, themselves, out, of, the, water, it, is, thought, they, may, have, propelled, themselves, with, their, forelimbs, dragging, their, hindquarters, in, a, similar, manner, to, that, used, by, the, elephant, seal, in, the, early, carboniferous, 360, to, 323, million, years, ago, the, climate, was, relatively, wet, and, warm, extensive, swamps, developed, with, mosses, ferns, horsetails, and, calamites, air, breathing, arthropods, evolved, and, invaded, the, land, where, they, provided, food, for, the, carnivorous, amphibians, that, began, to, adapt, to, the, terrestrial, environment, there, were, no, other, tetrapods, on, the, land, and, the, amphibians, were, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, with, some, occupying, ecological, positions, currently, held, by, crocodiles, though, equipped, with, limbs, and, the, ability, to, breathe, air, most, still, had, a, long, tapering, body, and, strong, tail, others, were, the, top, land, predators, sometimes, reaching, several, metres, in, length, preying, on, the, large, insects, of, the, period, and, the, many, types, of, fish, in, the, water, they, still, needed, to, return, to, water, to, lay, their, shell, less, eggs, and, even, most, modern, amphibians, have, a, fully, aquatic, larval, stage, with, gills, like, their, fish, ancestors, it, was, the, development, of, the, amniotic, egg, which, prevents, the, developing, embryo, from, drying, out, that, enabled, the, reptiles, to, reproduce, on, land, and, which, led, to, their, dominance, in, the, period, that, followed, after, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, amphibian, dominance, gave, way, to, reptiles, and, amphibians, were, further, devastated, by, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, during, the, triassic, period, 252, to, 201, million, years, ago, the, reptiles, continued, to, out, compete, the, amphibians, leading, to, a, reduction, in, both, the, amphibians, size, and, their, importance, in, the, biosphere, according, to, the, fossil, record, lissamphibia, which, includes, all, modern, amphibians, and, is, the, only, surviving, lineage, may, have, branched, off, from, the, extinct, groups, temnospondyli, and, lepospondyli, at, some, period, between, the, late, carboniferous, and, the, early, triassic, the, relative, scarcity, of, fossil, evidence, precludes, precise, dating, but, the, most, recent, molecular, study, based, on, multilocus, sequence, typing, suggests, a, late, carboniferous, early, permian, origin, for, extant, amphibians, the, origins, and, evolutionary, relationships, between, the, three, main, groups, of, amphibians, is, a, matter, of, debate, a, 2005, molecular, phylogeny, based, on, rdna, analysis, suggests, that, salamanders, and, caecilians, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, frogs, it, also, appears, that, the, divergence, of, the, three, groups, took, place, in, the, paleozoic, or, early, mesozoic, around, 250, million, years, ago, before, the, breakup, of, the, supercontinent, pangaea, and, soon, after, their, divergence, from, the, lobe, finned, fish, the, briefness, of, this, period, and, the, swiftness, with, which, radiation, took, place, would, help, account, for, the, relative, scarcity, of, primitive, amphibian, fossils, there, are, large, gaps, in, the, fossil, record, the, discovery, of, the, dissorophoid, temnospondyl, gerobatrachus, from, the, early, permian, in, texas, in, 2008, provided, a, missing, link, with, many, of, the, characteristics, of, modern, frogs, molecular, analysis, suggests, that, the, frog, salamander, divergence, took, place, considerably, earlier, than, the, palaeontological, evidence, indicates, one, study, suggested, that, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, modern, amphibians, lived, about, 315, million, years, ago, and, that, stereospondyl, temnospondyls, are, the, closest, relatives, to, the, caecilians, however, most, studies, support, a, single, monophyletic, origin, of, all, modern, amphibians, within, the, dissorophoid, temnospondyls, as, they, evolved, from, lunged, fish, amphibians, had, to, make, certain, adaptations, for, living, on, land, including, the, need, to, develop, new, means, of, locomotion, in, the, water, the, sideways, thrusts, of, their, tails, had, propelled, them, forward, but, on, land, quite, different, mechanisms, were, required, their, vertebral, columns, limbs, limb, girdles, and, musculature, needed, to, be, strong, enough, to, raise, them, off, the, ground, for, locomotion, and, feeding, terrestrial, adults, discarded, their, lateral, line, systems, and, adapted, their, sensory, systems, to, receive, stimuli, via, the, medium, of, the, air, they, needed, to, develop, new, methods, to, regulate, their, body, heat, to, cope, with, fluctuations, in, ambient, temperature, they, developed, behaviours, suitable, for, reproduction, in, a, terrestrial, environment, their, skins, were, exposed, to, harmful, ultraviolet, rays, that, had, previously, been, absorbed, by, the, water, the, skin, changed, to, become, more, protective, and, prevent, excessive, water, loss, the, superclass, tetrapoda, is, divided, into, four, classes, of, vertebrate, animals, with, four, limbs, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, are, amniotes, the, eggs, of, which, are, either, laid, or, carried, by, the, female, and, are, surrounded, by, several, membranes, some, of, which, are, impervious, lacking, these, membranes, amphibians, require, water, bodies, for, reproduction, although, some, species, have, developed, various, strategies, for, protecting, or, bypassing, the, vulnerable, aquatic, larval, stage, they, are, not, found, in, the, sea, with, the, exception, of, one, or, two, frogs, that, live, in, brackish, water, in, mangrove, swamps, the, anderson, s, salamander, meanwhile, occurs, in, brackish, or, salt, water, lakes, on, land, amphibians, are, restricted, to, moist, habitats, because, of, the, need, to, keep, their, skin, damp, modern, amphibians, have, a, simplified, anatomy, compared, to, their, ancestors, due, to, paedomorphosis, caused, by, two, evolutionary, trends, miniaturization, and, an, unusually, large, genome, which, result, in, a, slower, growth, and, development, rate, compared, to, other, vertebrates, another, reason, for, their, size, is, associated, with, their, rapid, metamorphosis, which, seems, to, have, evolved, only, in, the, ancestors, of, lissamphibia, in, all, other, known, lines, the, development, was, much, more, gradual, because, a, remodeling, of, the, feeding, apparatus, means, they, do, not, eat, during, the, metamorphosis, the, metamorphosis, has, to, go, faster, the, smaller, the, individual, is, so, it, happens, at, an, early, stage, when, the, larvae, are, still, small, the, largest, species, of, salamanders, do, not, go, through, a, metamorphosis, amphibians, that, lay, eggs, on, land, often, go, through, the, whole, metamorphosis, inside, the, egg, an, anamniotic, terrestrial, egg, is, less, than, 1, cm, in, diameter, due, to, diffusion, problems, a, size, which, puts, a, limit, on, the, amount, of, posthatching, growth, the, smallest, amphibian, and, vertebrate, in, the, world, is, a, microhylid, frog, from, new, guinea, paedophryne, amauensis, first, discovered, in, 2012, it, has, an, average, length, of, 7, 7, mm, 0, 30, in, and, is, part, of, a, genus, that, contains, four, of, the, world, s, ten, smallest, frog, species, the, largest, living, amphibian, is, the, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, chinese, giant, salamander, andrias, davidianus, but, this, is, a, great, deal, smaller, than, the, largest, amphibian, that, ever, existed, the, extinct, 9, m, 30, ft, prionosuchus, a, crocodile, like, temnospondyl, dating, to, 270, million, years, ago, from, the, middle, permian, of, brazil, the, largest, frog, is, the, african, goliath, frog, conraua, goliath, which, can, reach, 32, cm, 13, in, and, weigh, 3, kg, 6, 6, lb, amphibians, are, ectothermic, cold, blooded, vertebrates, that, do, not, maintain, their, body, temperature, through, internal, physiological, processes, their, metabolic, rate, is, low, and, as, a, result, their, food, and, energy, requirements, are, limited, in, the, adult, state, they, have, tear, ducts, and, movable, eyelids, and, most, species, have, ears, that, can, detect, airborne, or, ground, vibrations, they, have, muscular, tongues, which, in, many, species, can, be, protruded, modern, amphibians, have, fully, ossified, vertebrae, with, articular, processes, their, ribs, are, usually, short, and, may, be, fused, to, the, vertebrae, their, skulls, are, mostly, broad, and, short, and, are, often, incompletely, ossified, their, skin, contains, little, keratin, and, lacks, scales, apart, from, a, few, fish, like, scales, in, certain, caecilians, the, skin, contains, many, mucous, glands, and, in, some, species, poison, glands, a, type, of, granular, gland, the, hearts, of, amphibians, have, three, chambers, two, atria, and, one, ventricle, they, have, a, urinary, bladder, and, nitrogenous, waste, products, are, excreted, primarily, as, urea, most, amphibians, lay, their, eggs, in, water, and, have, aquatic, larvae, that, undergo, metamorphosis, to, become, terrestrial, adults, amphibians, breathe, by, means, of, a, pump, action, in, which, air, is, first, drawn, into, the, buccopharyngeal, region, through, the, nostrils, these, are, then, closed, and, the, air, is, forced, into, the, lungs, by, contraction, of, the, throat, they, supplement, this, with, gas, exchange, through, the, skin, the, order, anura, from, the, ancient, greek, a, n, meaning, without, and, oura, meaning, tail, comprises, the, frogs, and, toads, they, usually, have, long, hind, limbs, that, fold, underneath, them, shorter, forelimbs, webbed, toes, with, no, claws, no, tails, large, eyes, and, glandular, moist, skin, members, of, this, order, with, smooth, skins, are, commonly, referred, to, as, frogs, while, those, with, warty, skins, are, known, as, toads, the, difference, is, not, a, formal, one, taxonomically, and, there, are, numerous, exceptions, to, this, rule, members, of, the, family, bufonidae, are, known, as, the, true, toads, frogs, range, in, size, from, the, 30, centimetre, 12, in, goliath, frog, conraua, goliath, of, west, africa, to, the, 7, 7, millimetre, 0, 30, in, paedophryne, amauensis, first, described, in, papua, new, guinea, in, 2012, which, is, also, the, smallest, known, vertebrate, although, most, species, are, associated, with, water, and, damp, habitats, some, are, specialised, to, live, in, trees, or, in, deserts, they, are, found, worldwide, except, for, polar, areas, anura, is, divided, into, three, suborders, that, are, broadly, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, but, the, relationships, between, some, families, remain, unclear, future, molecular, studies, should, provide, further, insights, into, their, evolutionary, relationships, the, suborder, archaeobatrachia, contains, four, families, of, primitive, frogs, these, are, ascaphidae, bombinatoridae, discoglossidae, and, leiopelmatidae, which, have, few, derived, features, and, are, probably, paraphyletic, with, regard, to, other, frog, lineages, the, six, families, in, the, more, evolutionarily, advanced, suborder, mesobatrachia, are, the, fossorial, megophryidae, pelobatidae, pelodytidae, scaphiopodidae, and, rhinophrynidae, and, the, obligatorily, aquatic, pipidae, these, have, certain, characteristics, that, are, intermediate, between, the, two, other, suborders, neobatrachia, is, by, far, the, largest, suborder, and, includes, the, remaining, families, of, modern, frogs, including, most, common, species, approximately, 96, of, the, over, 5, 000, extant, species, of, frog, are, neobatrachians, the, order, caudata, from, the, latin, cauda, meaning, tail, consists, of, the, salamanders, elongated, low, slung, animals, that, mostly, resemble, lizards, in, form, this, is, a, symplesiomorphic, trait, and, they, are, no, more, closely, related, to, lizards, than, they, are, to, mammals, salamanders, lack, claws, have, scale, free, skins, either, smooth, or, covered, with, tubercles, and, tails, that, are, usually, flattened, from, side, to, side, and, often, finned, they, range, in, size, from, the, chinese, giant, salamander, andrias, davidianus, which, has, been, reported, to, grow, to, a, length, of, 1, 8, metres, 5, ft, 11, in, to, the, diminutive, thorius, pennatulus, from, mexico, which, seldom, exceeds, 20, mm, 0, 8, in, in, length, salamanders, have, a, mostly, laurasian, distribution, being, present, in, much, of, the, holarctic, region, of, the, northern, hemisphere, the, family, plethodontidae, is, also, found, in, central, america, and, south, america, north, of, the, amazon, basin, south, america, was, apparently, invaded, from, central, america, by, about, the, start, of, the, miocene, 23, million, years, ago, urodela, is, a, name, sometimes, used, for, all, the, extant, species, of, salamanders, members, of, several, salamander, families, have, become, paedomorphic, and, either, fail, to, complete, their, metamorphosis, or, retain, some, larval, characteristics, as, adults, most, salamanders, are, under, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, long, they, may, be, terrestrial, or, aquatic, and, many, spend, part, of, the, year, in, each, habitat, when, on, land, they, mostly, spend, the, day, hidden, under, stones, or, logs, or, in, dense, vegetation, emerging, in, the, evening, and, night, to, forage, for, worms, insects, and, other, invertebrates, the, suborder, cryptobranchoidea, contains, the, primitive, salamanders, a, number, of, fossil, cryptobranchids, have, been, found, but, there, are, only, three, living, species, the, chinese, giant, salamander, andrias, davidianus, the, japanese, giant, salamander, andrias, japonicus, and, the, hellbender, cryptobranchus, alleganiensis, from, north, america, these, large, amphibians, retain, several, larval, characteristics, in, their, adult, state, gills, slits, are, present, and, the, eyes, are, unlidded, a, unique, feature, is, their, ability, to, feed, by, suction, depressing, either, the, left, side, of, their, lower, jaw, or, the, right, the, males, excavate, nests, persuade, females, to, lay, their, egg, strings, inside, them, and, guard, them, as, well, as, breathing, with, lungs, they, respire, through, the, many, folds, in, their, thin, skin, which, has, capillaries, close, to, the, surface, the, suborder, salamandroidea, contains, the, advanced, salamanders, they, differ, from, the, cryptobranchids, by, having, fused, prearticular, bones, in, the, lower, jaw, and, by, using, internal, fertilisation, in, salamandrids, the, male, deposits, a, bundle, of, sperm, the, spermatophore, and, the, female, picks, it, up, and, inserts, it, into, her, cloaca, where, the, sperm, is, stored, until, the, eggs, are, laid, the, largest, family, in, this, group, is, plethodontidae, the, lungless, salamanders, which, includes, 60, of, all, salamander, species, the, family, salamandridae, includes, the, true, salamanders, and, the, name, newt, is, given, to, members, of, its, subfamily, pleurodelinae, the, third, suborder, sirenoidea, contains, the, four, species, of, sirens, which, are, in, a, single, family, sirenidae, members, of, this, order, are, eel, like, aquatic, salamanders, with, much, reduced, forelimbs, and, no, hind, limbs, some, of, their, features, are, primitive, while, others, are, derived, fertilisation, is, likely, to, be, external, as, sirenids, lack, the, cloacal, glands, used, by, male, salamandrids, to, produce, spermatophores, and, the, females, lack, spermathecae, for, sperm, storage, despite, this, the, eggs, are, laid, singly, a, behaviour, not, conducive, for, external, fertilisation, the, order, gymnophiona, from, the, greek, gymnos, meaning, naked, and, ophis, meaning, serpent, or, apoda, comprises, the, caecilians, these, are, long, cylindrical, limbless, animals, with, a, snake, or, worm, like, form, the, adults, vary, in, length, from, 8, to, 75, centimetres, 3, to, 30, inches, with, the, exception, of, thomson, s, caecilian, caecilia, thompsoni, which, can, reach, 150, cm, 59, in, a, caecilian, s, skin, has, a, large, number, of, transverse, folds, and, in, some, species, contains, tiny, embedded, dermal, scales, it, has, rudimentary, eyes, covered, in, skin, which, are, probably, limited, to, discerning, differences, in, light, intensity, it, also, has, a, pair, of, short, tentacles, near, the, eye, that, can, be, extended, and, which, have, tactile, and, olfactory, functions, most, caecilians, live, underground, in, burrows, in, damp, soil, in, rotten, wood, and, under, plant, debris, but, some, are, aquatic, most, species, lay, their, eggs, underground, and, when, the, larvae, hatch, they, make, their, way, to, adjacent, bodies, of, water, others, brood, their, eggs, and, the, larvae, undergo, metamorphosis, before, the, eggs, hatch, a, few, species, give, birth, to, live, young, nourishing, them, with, glandular, secretions, while, they, are, in, the, oviduct, caecilians, have, a, mostly, gondwanan, distribution, being, found, in, tropical, regions, of, africa, asia, and, central, and, south, america, the, integumentary, structure, contains, some, typical, characteristics, common, to, terrestrial, vertebrates, such, as, the, presence, of, highly, cornified, outer, layers, renewed, periodically, through, a, moulting, process, controlled, by, the, pituitary, and, thyroid, glands, local, thickenings, often, called, warts, are, common, such, as, those, found, on, toads, the, outside, of, the, skin, is, shed, periodically, mostly, in, one, piece, in, contrast, to, mammals, and, birds, where, it, is, shed, in, flakes, amphibians, often, eat, the, sloughed, skin, caecilians, are, unique, among, amphibians, in, having, mineralized, dermal, scales, embedded, in, the, dermis, between, the, furrows, in, the, skin, the, similarity, of, these, to, the, scales, of, bony, fish, is, largely, superficial, lizards, and, some, frogs, have, somewhat, similar, osteoderms, forming, bony, deposits, in, the, dermis, but, this, is, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, with, similar, structures, having, arisen, independently, in, diverse, vertebrate, lineages, amphibian, skin, is, permeable, to, water, gas, exchange, can, take, place, through, the, skin, cutaneous, respiration, and, this, allows, adult, amphibians, to, respire, without, rising, to, the, surface, of, water, and, to, hibernate, at, the, bottom, of, ponds, to, compensate, for, their, thin, and, delicate, skin, amphibians, have, evolved, mucous, glands, principally, on, their, heads, backs, and, tails, the, secretions, produced, by, these, help, keep, the, skin, moist, in, addition, most, species, of, amphibian, have, granular, glands, that, secrete, distasteful, or, poisonous, substances, some, amphibian, toxins, can, be, lethal, to, humans, while, others, have, little, effect, the, main, poison, producing, glands, the, parotoids, produce, the, neurotoxin, bufotoxin, and, are, located, behind, the, ears, of, toads, along, the, backs, of, frogs, behind, the, eyes, of, salamanders, and, on, the, upper, surface, of, caecilians, the, skin, colour, of, amphibians, is, produced, by, three, layers, of, pigment, cells, called, chromatophores, these, three, cell, layers, consist, of, the, melanophores, occupying, the, deepest, layer, the, guanophores, forming, an, intermediate, layer, and, containing, many, granules, producing, a, blue, green, colour, and, the, lipophores, yellow, the, most, superficial, layer, the, colour, change, displayed, by, many, species, is, initiated, by, hormones, secreted, by, the, pituitary, gland, unlike, bony, fish, there, is, no, direct, control, of, the, pigment, cells, by, the, nervous, system, and, this, results, in, the, colour, change, taking, place, more, slowly, than, happens, in, fish, a, vividly, coloured, skin, usually, indicates, that, the, species, is, toxic, and, is, a, warning, sign, to, predators, amphibians, have, a, skeletal, system, that, is, structurally, homologous, to, other, tetrapods, though, with, a, number, of, variations, they, all, have, four, limbs, except, for, the, legless, caecilians, and, a, few, species, of, salamander, with, reduced, or, no, limbs, the, bones, are, hollow, and, lightweight, the, musculoskeletal, system, is, strong, to, enable, it, to, support, the, head, and, body, the, bones, are, fully, ossified, and, the, vertebrae, interlock, with, each, other, by, means, of, overlapping, processes, the, pectoral, girdle, is, supported, by, muscle, and, the, well, developed, pelvic, girdle, is, attached, to, the, backbone, by, a, pair, of, sacral, ribs, the, ilium, slopes, forward, and, the, body, is, held, closer, to, the, ground, than, is, the, case, in, mammals, in, most, amphibians, there, are, four, digits, on, the, fore, foot, and, five, on, the, hind, foot, but, no, claws, on, either, some, salamanders, have, fewer, digits, and, the, amphiumas, are, eel, like, in, appearance, with, tiny, stubby, legs, the, sirens, are, aquatic, salamanders, with, stumpy, forelimbs, and, no, hind, limbs, the, caecilians, are, limbless, they, burrow, in, the, manner, of, earthworms, with, zones, of, muscle, contractions, moving, along, the, body, on, the, surface, of, the, ground, or, in, water, they, move, by, undulating, their, body, from, side, to, side, in, frogs, the, hind, legs, are, larger, than, the, fore, legs, especially, so, in, those, species, that, principally, move, by, jumping, or, swimming, in, the, walkers, and, runners, the, hind, limbs, are, not, so, large, and, the, burrowers, mostly, have, short, limbs, and, broad, bodies, the, feet, have, adaptations, for, the, way, of, life, with, webbing, between, the, toes, for, swimming, broad, adhesive, toe, pads, for, climbing, and, keratinised, tubercles, on, the, hind, feet, for, digging, frogs, usually, dig, backwards, into, the, soil, in, most, salamanders, the, limbs, are, short, and, more, or, less, the, same, length, and, project, at, right, angles, from, the, body, locomotion, on, land, is, by, walking, and, the, tail, often, swings, from, side, to, side, or, is, used, as, a, prop, particularly, when, climbing, in, their, normal, gait, only, one, leg, is, advanced, at, a, time, in, the, manner, adopted, by, their, ancestors, the, lobe, finned, fish, some, salamanders, in, the, genus, aneides, and, certain, plethodontids, climb, trees, and, have, long, limbs, large, toepads, and, prehensile, tails, in, aquatic, salamanders, and, in, frog, tadpoles, the, tail, has, dorsal, and, ventral, fins, and, is, moved, from, side, to, side, as, a, means, of, propulsion, adult, frogs, do, not, have, tails, and, caecilians, have, only, very, short, ones, salamanders, use, their, tails, in, defence, and, some, are, prepared, to, jettison, them, to, save, their, lives, in, a, process, known, as, autotomy, certain, species, in, the, plethodontidae, have, a, weak, zone, at, the, base, of, the, tail, and, use, this, strategy, readily, the, tail, often, continues, to, twitch, after, separation, which, may, distract, the, attacker, and, allow, the, salamander, to, escape, both, tails, and, limbs, can, be, regenerated, adult, frogs, are, unable, to, regrow, limbs, but, tadpoles, can, do, so, amphibians, have, a, juvenile, stage, and, an, adult, stage, and, the, circulatory, systems, of, the, two, are, distinct, in, the, juvenile, or, tadpole, stage, the, circulation, is, similar, to, that, of, a, fish, the, two, chambered, heart, pumps, the, blood, through, the, gills, where, it, is, oxygenated, and, is, spread, around, the, body, and, back, to, the, heart, in, a, single, loop, in, the, adult, stage, amphibians, especially, frogs, lose, their, gills, and, develop, lungs, they, have, a, heart, that, consists, of, a, single, ventricle, and, two, atria, when, the, ventricle, starts, contracting, deoxygenated, blood, is, pumped, through, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, lungs, continued, contraction, then, pumps, oxygenated, blood, around, the, rest, of, the, body, mixing, of, the, two, bloodstreams, is, minimized, by, the, anatomy, of, the, chambers, the, nervous, system, is, basically, the, same, as, in, other, vertebrates, with, a, central, brain, a, spinal, cord, and, nerves, throughout, the, body, the, amphibian, brain, is, relatively, simple, but, broadly, the, same, structurally, as, in, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, their, brains, are, elongated, except, in, caecilians, and, contain, the, usual, motor, and, sensory, areas, of, tetrapods, the, pineal, body, known, to, regulate, sleep, patterns, in, humans, is, thought, to, produce, the, hormones, involved, in, hibernation, and, aestivation, in, amphibians, tadpoles, retain, the, lateral, line, system, of, their, ancestral, fishes, but, this, is, lost, in, terrestrial, adult, amphibians, many, aquatic, salamanders, and, some, caecilians, possess, electroreceptors, called, ampullary, organs, completely, absent, in, anurans, that, allow, them, to, locate, objects, around, them, when, submerged, in, water, the, ears, are, well, developed, in, frogs, there, is, no, external, ear, but, the, large, circular, eardrum, lies, on, the, surface, of, the, head, just, behind, the, eye, this, vibrates, and, sound, is, transmitted, through, a, single, bone, the, stapes, to, the, inner, ear, only, high, frequency, sounds, like, mating, calls, are, heard, in, this, way, but, low, frequency, noises, can, be, detected, through, another, mechanism, there, is, a, patch, of, specialized, haircells, called, papilla, amphibiorum, in, the, inner, ear, capable, of, detecting, deeper, sounds, another, feature, unique, to, frogs, and, salamanders, is, the, columella, operculum, complex, adjoining, the, auditory, capsule, which, is, involved, in, the, transmission, of, both, airborne, and, seismic, signals, the, ears, of, salamanders, and, caecilians, are, less, highly, developed, than, those, of, frogs, as, they, do, not, normally, communicate, with, each, other, through, the, medium, of, sound, the, eyes, of, tadpoles, lack, lids, but, at, metamorphosis, the, cornea, becomes, more, dome, shaped, the, lens, becomes, flatter, and, eyelids, and, associated, glands, and, ducts, develop, the, adult, eyes, are, an, improvement, on, invertebrate, eyes, and, were, a, first, step, in, the, development, of, more, advanced, vertebrate, eyes, they, allow, colour, vision, and, depth, of, focus, in, the, retinas, are, green, rods, which, are, receptive, to, a, wide, range, of, wavelengths, many, amphibians, catch, their, prey, by, flicking, out, an, elongated, tongue, with, a, sticky, tip, and, drawing, it, back, into, the, mouth, before, seizing, the, item, with, their, jaws, some, use, inertial, feeding, to, help, them, swallow, the, prey, repeatedly, thrusting, their, head, forward, sharply, causing, the, food, to, move, backwards, in, their, mouth, by, inertia, most, amphibians, swallow, their, prey, whole, without, much, chewing, so, they, possess, voluminous, stomachs, the, short, oesophagus, is, lined, with, cilia, that, help, to, move, the, food, to, the, stomach, and, mucus, produced, by, glands, in, the, mouth, and, pharynx, eases, its, passage, the, enzyme, chitinase, produced, in, the, stomach, helps, digest, the, chitinous, cuticle, of, arthropod, prey, amphibians, possess, a, pancreas, liver, and, gall, bladder, the, liver, is, usually, large, with, two, lobes, its, size, is, determined, by, its, function, as, a, glycogen, and, fat, storage, unit, and, may, change, with, the, seasons, as, these, reserves, are, built, or, used, up, adipose, tissue, is, another, important, means, of, storing, energy, and, this, occurs, in, the, abdomen, in, internal, structures, called, fat, bodies, under, the, skin, and, in, some, salamanders, in, the, tail, there, are, two, kidneys, located, dorsally, near, the, roof, of, the, body, cavity, their, job, is, to, filter, the, blood, of, metabolic, waste, and, transport, the, urine, via, ureters, to, the, urinary, bladder, where, it, is, stored, before, being, passed, out, periodically, through, the, cloacal, vent, larvae, and, most, aquatic, adult, amphibians, excrete, the, nitrogen, as, ammonia, in, large, quantities, of, dilute, urine, while, terrestrial, species, with, a, greater, need, to, conserve, water, excrete, the, less, toxic, product, urea, some, tree, frogs, with, limited, access, to, water, excrete, most, of, their, metabolic, waste, as, uric, acid, most, aquatic, and, semi, aquatic, amphibians, have, a, membranous, skin, which, allows, them, to, absorb, water, directly, through, it, some, semi, aquatic, animals, also, have, similarly, permeable, bladder, membrane, as, a, result, they, tend, to, have, high, rates, of, urine, production, to, offset, this, high, water, intake, and, have, urine, which, is, low, in, dissolved, salts, the, urinary, bladder, assists, such, animals, to, retain, salts, some, aquatic, amphibian, such, as, xenopus, do, not, reabsorb, water, to, prevent, excessive, water, influx, for, land, dwelling, amphibians, dehydration, results, in, reduced, urine, output, the, amphibian, bladder, is, usually, highly, distensible, and, among, some, land, dwelling, species, of, frogs, and, salamanders, may, account, for, between, 20, and, 50, of, their, total, body, weight, urine, flows, from, the, kidneys, through, the, ureters, into, the, bladder, and, is, periodically, released, from, the, bladder, to, the, cloaca, the, lungs, in, amphibians, are, primitive, compared, to, those, of, amniotes, possessing, few, internal, septa, and, large, alveoli, and, consequently, having, a, comparatively, slow, diffusion, rate, for, oxygen, entering, the, blood, ventilation, is, accomplished, by, buccal, pumping, most, amphibians, however, are, able, to, exchange, gases, with, the, water, or, air, via, their, skin, to, enable, sufficient, cutaneous, respiration, the, surface, of, their, highly, vascularised, skin, must, remain, moist, to, allow, the, oxygen, to, diffuse, at, a, sufficiently, high, rate, because, oxygen, concentration, in, the, water, increases, at, both, low, temperatures, and, high, flow, rates, aquatic, amphibians, in, these, situations, can, rely, primarily, on, cutaneous, respiration, as, in, the, titicaca, water, frog, and, the, hellbender, salamander, in, air, where, oxygen, is, more, concentrated, some, small, species, can, rely, solely, on, cutaneous, gas, exchange, most, famously, the, plethodontid, salamanders, which, have, neither, lungs, nor, gills, many, aquatic, salamanders, and, all, tadpoles, have, gills, in, their, larval, stage, with, some, such, as, the, axolotl, retaining, gills, as, aquatic, adults, for, the, purpose, of, reproduction, most, amphibians, require, fresh, water, although, some, lay, their, eggs, on, land, and, have, developed, various, means, of, keeping, them, moist, a, few, e, g, fejervarya, raja, can, inhabit, brackish, water, but, there, are, no, true, marine, amphibians, there, are, reports, however, of, particular, amphibian, populations, unexpectedly, invading, marine, waters, such, was, the, case, with, the, black, sea, invasion, of, the, natural, hybrid, pelophylax, esculentus, reported, in, 2010, several, hundred, frog, species, in, adaptive, radiations, e, g, eleutherodactylus, the, pacific, platymantis, the, australo, papuan, microhylids, and, many, other, tropical, frogs, however, do, not, need, any, water, for, breeding, in, the, wild, they, reproduce, via, direct, development, an, ecological, and, evolutionary, adaptation, that, has, allowed, them, to, be, completely, independent, from, free, standing, water, almost, all, of, these, frogs, live, in, wet, tropical, rainforests, and, their, eggs, hatch, directly, into, miniature, versions, of, the, adult, passing, through, the, tadpole, stage, within, the, egg, reproductive, success, of, many, amphibians, is, dependent, not, only, on, the, quantity, of, rainfall, but, the, seasonal, timing, in, the, tropics, many, amphibians, breed, continuously, or, at, any, time, of, year, in, temperate, regions, breeding, is, mostly, seasonal, usually, in, the, spring, and, is, triggered, by, increasing, day, length, rising, temperatures, or, rainfall, experiments, have, shown, the, importance, of, temperature, but, the, trigger, event, especially, in, arid, regions, is, often, a, storm, in, anurans, males, usually, arrive, at, the, breeding, sites, before, females, and, the, vocal, chorus, they, produce, may, stimulate, ovulation, in, females, and, the, endocrine, activity, of, males, that, are, not, yet, reproductively, active, in, caecilians, fertilisation, is, internal, the, male, extruding, an, intromittent, organ, the, phallodeum, and, inserting, it, into, the, female, cloaca, the, paired, m, llerian, glands, inside, the, male, cloaca, secrete, a, fluid, which, resembles, that, produced, by, mammalian, prostate, glands, and, which, may, transport, and, nourish, the, sperm, fertilisation, probably, takes, place, in, the, oviduct, the, majority, of, salamanders, also, engage, in, internal, fertilisation, in, most, of, these, the, male, deposits, a, spermatophore, a, small, packet, of, sperm, on, top, of, a, gelatinous, cone, on, the, substrate, either, on, land, or, in, the, water, the, female, takes, up, the, sperm, packet, by, grasping, it, with, the, lips, of, the, cloaca, and, pushing, it, into, the, vent, the, spermatozoa, move, to, the, spermatheca, in, the, roof, of, the, cloaca, where, they, remain, until, ovulation, which, may, be, many, months, later, courtship, rituals, and, methods, of, transfer, of, the, spermatophore, vary, between, species, in, some, the, spermatophore, may, be, placed, directly, into, the, female, cloaca, while, in, others, the, female, may, be, guided, to, the, spermatophore, or, restrained, with, an, embrace, called, amplexus, certain, primitive, salamanders, in, the, families, sirenidae, hynobiidae, and, cryptobranchidae, practice, external, fertilisation, in, a, similar, manner, to, frogs, with, the, female, laying, the, eggs, in, water, and, the, male, releasing, sperm, onto, the, egg, mass, with, a, few, exceptions, frogs, use, external, fertilisation, the, male, grasps, the, female, tightly, with, his, forelimbs, either, behind, the, arms, or, in, front, of, the, back, legs, or, in, the, case, of, epipedobates, tricolor, around, the, neck, they, remain, in, amplexus, with, their, cloacae, positioned, close, together, while, the, female, lays, the, eggs, and, the, male, covers, them, with, sperm, roughened, nuptial, pads, on, the, male, s, hands, aid, in, retaining, grip, often, the, male, collects, and, retains, the, egg, mass, forming, a, sort, of, basket, with, the, hind, feet, an, exception, is, the, granular, poison, frog, oophaga, granulifera, where, the, male, and, female, place, their, cloacae, in, close, proximity, while, facing, in, opposite, directions, and, then, release, eggs, and, sperm, simultaneously, the, tailed, frog, ascaphus, truei, exhibits, internal, fertilisation, the, tail, is, only, possessed, by, the, male, and, is, an, extension, of, the, cloaca, and, used, to, inseminate, the, female, this, frog, lives, in, fast, flowing, streams, and, internal, fertilisation, prevents, the, sperm, from, being, washed, away, before, fertilisation, occurs, the, sperm, may, be, retained, in, storage, tubes, attached, to, the, oviduct, until, the, following, spring, most, frogs, can, be, classified, as, either, prolonged, or, explosive, breeders, typically, prolonged, breeders, congregate, at, a, breeding, site, the, males, usually, arriving, first, calling, and, setting, up, territories, other, satellite, males, remain, quietly, nearby, waiting, for, their, opportunity, to, take, over, a, territory, the, females, arrive, sporadically, mate, selection, takes, place, and, eggs, are, laid, the, females, depart, and, territories, may, change, hands, more, females, appear, and, in, due, course, the, breeding, season, comes, to, an, end, explosive, breeders, on, the, other, hand, are, found, where, temporary, pools, appear, in, dry, regions, after, rainfall, these, frogs, are, typically, fossorial, species, that, emerge, after, heavy, rains, and, congregate, at, a, breeding, site, they, are, attracted, there, by, the, calling, of, the, first, male, to, find, a, suitable, place, perhaps, a, pool, that, forms, in, the, same, place, each, rainy, season, the, assembled, frogs, may, call, in, unison, and, frenzied, activity, ensues, the, males, scrambling, to, mate, with, the, usually, smaller, number, of, females, there, is, a, direct, competition, between, males, to, win, the, attention, of, the, females, in, salamanders, and, newts, with, elaborate, courtship, displays, to, keep, the, female, s, attention, long, enough, to, get, her, interested, in, choosing, him, to, mate, with, some, species, store, sperm, through, long, breeding, seasons, as, the, extra, time, may, allow, for, interactions, with, rival, sperm, unisexual, female, mole, salamanders, genus, ambystoma, are, common, in, the, great, lakes, region, of, north, america, these, salamanders, are, the, oldest, known, unisexual, vertebrate, lineage, having, emerged, about, 5, million, years, ago, genome, exchange, can, sometimes, occur, between, the, unisexual, female, ambystoma, and, males, from, sympatric, sexual, species, most, amphibians, go, through, metamorphosis, a, process, of, significant, morphological, change, after, birth, in, typical, amphibian, development, eggs, are, laid, in, water, and, larvae, are, adapted, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, frogs, toads, and, salamanders, all, hatch, from, the, egg, as, larvae, with, external, gills, metamorphosis, in, amphibians, is, regulated, by, thyroxine, concentration, in, the, blood, which, stimulates, metamorphosis, and, prolactin, which, counteracts, thyroxine, s, effect, specific, events, are, dependent, on, threshold, values, for, different, tissues, because, most, embryonic, development, is, outside, the, parental, body, it, is, subject, to, many, adaptations, due, to, specific, environmental, circumstances, for, this, reason, tadpoles, can, have, horny, ridges, instead, of, teeth, whisker, like, skin, extensions, or, fins, they, also, make, use, of, a, sensory, lateral, line, organ, similar, to, that, of, fish, after, metamorphosis, these, organs, become, redundant, and, will, be, reabsorbed, by, controlled, cell, death, called, apoptosis, the, variety, of, adaptations, to, specific, environmental, circumstances, among, amphibians, is, wide, with, many, discoveries, still, being, made, in, the, egg, the, embryo, is, suspended, in, perivitelline, fluid, and, surrounded, by, semi, permeable, gelatinous, capsules, with, the, yolk, mass, providing, nutrients, as, the, larvae, hatch, the, capsules, are, dissolved, by, enzymes, secreted, from, gland, at, the, tip, of, the, snout, the, eggs, of, some, salamanders, and, frogs, contain, unicellular, green, algae, these, penetrate, the, jelly, envelope, after, the, eggs, are, laid, and, may, increase, the, supply, of, oxygen, to, the, embryo, through, photosynthesis, they, seem, to, both, speed, up, the, development, of, the, larvae, and, reduce, mortality, in, the, wood, frog, rana, sylvatica, the, interior, of, the, globular, egg, cluster, has, been, found, to, be, up, to, 6, c, 11, f, warmer, than, its, surroundings, which, is, an, advantage, in, its, cool, northern, habitat, the, eggs, may, be, deposited, singly, in, cluster, or, in, long, strands, sites, for, laying, eggs, include, water, mud, burrows, debris, and, on, plants, or, under, logs, or, stones, the, greenhouse, frog, eleutherodactylus, planirostris, lays, eggs, in, small, groups, in, the, soil, where, they, develop, in, about, two, weeks, directly, into, juvenile, frogs, without, an, intervening, larval, stage, the, tungara, frog, physalaemus, pustulosus, builds, a, floating, nest, from, foam, to, protect, its, eggs, first, a, raft, is, built, then, eggs, are, laid, in, the, centre, and, finally, a, foam, cap, is, overlaid, the, foam, has, anti, microbial, properties, it, contains, no, detergents, but, is, created, by, whipping, up, proteins, and, lectins, secreted, by, the, female, the, eggs, of, amphibians, are, typically, laid, in, water, and, hatch, into, free, living, larvae, that, complete, their, development, in, water, and, later, transform, into, either, aquatic, or, terrestrial, adults, in, many, species, of, frog, and, in, most, lungless, salamanders, plethodontidae, direct, development, takes, place, the, larvae, growing, within, the, eggs, and, emerging, as, miniature, adults, many, caecilians, and, some, other, amphibians, lay, their, eggs, on, land, and, the, newly, hatched, larvae, wriggle, or, are, transported, to, water, bodies, some, caecilians, the, alpine, salamander, salamandra, atra, and, some, of, the, african, live, bearing, toads, nectophrynoides, spp, are, viviparous, their, larvae, feed, on, glandular, secretions, and, develop, within, the, female, s, oviduct, often, for, long, periods, other, amphibians, but, not, caecilians, are, ovoviviparous, the, eggs, are, retained, in, or, on, the, parent, s, body, but, the, larvae, subsist, on, the, yolks, of, their, eggs, and, receive, no, nourishment, from, the, adult, the, larvae, emerge, at, varying, stages, of, their, growth, either, before, or, after, metamorphosis, according, to, their, species, the, toad, genus, nectophrynoides, exhibits, all, of, these, developmental, patterns, among, its, dozen, or, so, members, amphibian, larvae, are, known, as, tadpoles, they, have, thick, rounded, bodies, with, powerful, muscular, tails, unlike, in, other, amphibians, frog, tadpoles, do, not, resemble, adults, the, free, living, larvae, are, normally, fully, aquatic, but, the, tadpoles, of, some, species, such, as, nannophrys, ceylonensis, are, semi, terrestrial, and, live, among, wet, rocks, tadpoles, have, cartilaginous, skeletons, gills, for, respiration, external, gills, at, first, internal, gills, later, lateral, line, systems, and, large, tails, that, they, use, for, swimming, newly, hatched, tadpoles, soon, develop, gill, pouches, that, cover, the, gills, these, internal, gills, and, operculum, are, not, homologous, with, those, of, fish, and, are, only, found, in, tadpoles, as, both, salamanders, and, caecilians, have, external, gills, only, combined, with, buccal, pumping, the, internal, gills, has, allowed, tadpoles, to, adopt, a, filter, feeding, lifestyle, even, if, several, species, have, since, evolved, other, types, of, feeding, strategies, the, lungs, develop, early, and, are, used, as, accessory, breathing, organs, the, tadpoles, rising, to, the, water, surface, to, gulp, air, some, species, complete, their, development, inside, the, egg, and, hatch, directly, into, small, frogs, these, larvae, do, not, have, gills, but, instead, have, specialised, areas, of, skin, through, which, respiration, takes, place, while, tadpoles, do, not, have, true, teeth, in, most, species, the, jaws, have, long, parallel, rows, of, small, keratinized, structures, called, keradonts, surrounded, by, a, horny, beak, front, legs, are, formed, under, the, gill, sac, and, hind, legs, become, visible, a, few, days, later, iodine, and, t4, over, stimulate, the, spectacular, apoptosis, of, the, cells, of, the, larval, gills, tail, and, fins, also, stimulate, the, evolution, of, nervous, systems, transforming, the, aquatic, vegetarian, tadpole, into, the, terrestrial, carnivorous, frog, with, better, neurological, visuospatial, olfactory, and, cognitive, abilities, for, hunting, in, fact, tadpoles, developing, in, ponds, and, streams, are, typically, herbivorous, pond, tadpoles, tend, to, have, deep, bodies, large, caudal, fins, and, small, mouths, they, swim, in, the, quiet, waters, feeding, on, growing, or, loose, fragments, of, vegetation, stream, dwellers, mostly, have, larger, mouths, shallow, bodies, and, caudal, fins, they, attach, themselves, to, plants, and, stones, and, feed, on, the, surface, films, of, algae, and, bacteria, they, also, feed, on, diatoms, filtered, from, the, water, through, the, gills, and, stir, up, the, sediment, at, bottom, of, the, pond, ingesting, edible, fragments, they, have, a, relatively, long, spiral, shaped, gut, to, enable, them, to, digest, this, diet, some, species, are, carnivorous, at, the, tadpole, stage, eating, insects, smaller, tadpoles, and, fish, young, of, the, cuban, tree, frog, osteopilus, septentrionalis, can, occasionally, be, cannibalistic, the, younger, tadpoles, attacking, a, larger, more, developed, tadpole, when, it, is, undergoing, metamorphosis, at, metamorphosis, rapid, changes, in, the, body, take, place, as, the, lifestyle, of, the, frog, changes, completely, the, spiral, shaped, mouth, with, horny, tooth, ridges, is, reabsorbed, together, with, the, spiral, gut, the, animal, develops, a, large, jaw, and, its, gills, disappear, along, with, its, gill, sac, eyes, and, legs, grow, quickly, and, a, tongue, is, formed, there, are, associated, changes, in, the, neural, networks, such, as, development, of, stereoscopic, vision, and, loss, of, the, lateral, line, system, all, this, can, happen, in, about, a, day, a, few, days, later, the, tail, is, reabsorbed, due, to, the, higher, thyroxine, concentration, required, for, this, to, take, place, at, hatching, a, typical, salamander, larva, has, eyes, without, lids, teeth, in, both, upper, and, lower, jaws, three, pairs, of, feathery, external, gills, and, a, long, tail, with, dorsal, and, ventral, fins, the, forelimbs, may, be, partially, developed, and, the, hind, limbs, are, rudimentary, in, pond, living, species, but, may, be, rather, more, developed, in, species, that, reproduce, in, moving, water, pond, type, larvae, often, have, a, pair, of, balancers, rod, like, structures, on, either, side, of, the, head, that, may, prevent, the, gills, from, becoming, clogged, up, with, sediment, both, of, these, are, able, to, breed, some, have, larvae, that, never, fully, develop, into, the, adult, form, a, condition, known, as, neoteny, neoteny, occurs, when, the, animal, s, growth, rate, is, very, low, and, is, usually, linked, to, adverse, conditions, such, as, low, water, temperatures, that, may, change, the, response, of, the, tissues, to, the, hormone, thyroxine, as, well, as, lack, of, food, there, are, fifteen, species, of, obligate, neotenic, salamanders, including, species, of, necturus, proteus, and, amphiuma, and, many, examples, of, facultative, ones, such, as, the, northwestern, salamander, ambystoma, gracile, and, the, tiger, salamander, a, tigrinum, that, adopt, this, strategy, under, appropriate, environmental, circumstances, lungless, salamanders, in, the, family, plethodontidae, are, terrestrial, and, lay, a, small, number, of, unpigmented, eggs, in, a, cluster, among, damp, leaf, litter, each, egg, has, a, large, yolk, sac, and, the, larva, feeds, on, this, while, it, develops, inside, the, egg, emerging, fully, formed, as, a, juvenile, salamander, the, female, salamander, often, broods, the, eggs, in, the, genus, ensatinas, the, female, has, been, observed, to, coil, around, them, and, press, her, throat, area, against, them, effectively, massaging, them, with, a, mucous, secretion, in, newts, and, salamanders, metamorphosis, is, less, dramatic, than, in, frogs, this, is, because, the, larvae, are, already, carnivorous, and, continue, to, feed, as, predators, when, they, are, adults, so, few, changes, are, needed, to, their, digestive, systems, their, lungs, are, functional, early, but, the, larvae, do, not, make, as, much, use, of, them, as, do, tadpoles, their, gills, are, never, covered, by, gill, sacs, and, are, reabsorbed, just, before, the, animals, leave, the, water, other, changes, include, the, reduction, in, size, or, loss, of, tail, fins, the, closure, of, gill, slits, thickening, of, the, skin, the, development, of, eyelids, and, certain, changes, in, dentition, and, tongue, structure, salamanders, are, at, their, most, vulnerable, at, metamorphosis, as, swimming, speeds, are, reduced, and, transforming, tails, are, encumbrances, on, land, adult, salamanders, often, have, an, aquatic, phase, in, spring, and, summer, and, a, land, phase, in, winter, for, adaptation, to, a, water, phase, prolactin, is, the, required, hormone, and, for, adaptation, to, the, land, phase, thyroxine, external, gills, do, not, return, in, subsequent, aquatic, phases, because, these, are, completely, absorbed, upon, leaving, the, water, for, the, first, time, most, terrestrial, caecilians, that, lay, eggs, do, so, in, burrows, or, moist, places, on, land, near, bodies, of, water, the, development, of, the, young, of, ichthyophis, glutinosus, a, species, from, sri, lanka, has, been, much, studied, the, eel, like, larvae, hatch, out, of, the, eggs, and, make, their, way, to, water, they, have, three, pairs, of, external, red, feathery, gills, a, blunt, head, with, two, rudimentary, eyes, a, lateral, line, system, and, a, short, tail, with, fins, they, swim, by, undulating, their, body, from, side, to, side, they, are, mostly, active, at, night, soon, lose, their, gills, and, make, sorties, onto, land, metamorphosis, is, gradual, by, the, age, of, about, ten, months, they, have, developed, a, pointed, head, with, sensory, tentacles, near, the, mouth, and, lost, their, eyes, lateral, line, systems, and, tails, the, skin, thickens, embedded, scales, develop, and, the, body, divides, into, segments, by, this, time, the, caecilian, has, constructed, a, burrow, and, is, living, on, land, in, the, majority, of, species, of, caecilians, the, young, are, produced, by, viviparity, typhlonectes, compressicauda, a, species, from, south, america, is, typical, of, these, up, to, nine, larvae, can, develop, in, the, oviduct, at, any, one, time, they, are, elongated, and, have, paired, sac, like, gills, small, eyes, and, specialised, scraping, teeth, at, first, they, feed, on, the, yolks, of, the, eggs, but, as, this, source, of, nourishment, declines, they, begin, to, rasp, at, the, ciliated, epithelial, cells, that, line, the, oviduct, this, stimulates, the, secretion, of, fluids, rich, in, lipids, and, mucoproteins, on, which, they, feed, along, with, scrapings, from, the, oviduct, wall, they, may, increase, their, length, sixfold, and, be, two, fifths, as, long, as, their, mother, before, being, born, by, this, time, they, have, undergone, metamorphosis, lost, their, eyes, and, gills, developed, a, thicker, skin, and, mouth, tentacles, and, reabsorbed, their, teeth, a, permanent, set, of, teeth, grow, through, soon, after, birth, gills, are, only, necessarily, during, embryonic, development, and, in, species, that, give, birth, the, offspring, is, born, after, gill, degeneration, in, egg, laying, caecilians, the, gills, are, either, reabsorbed, before, hatching, or, in, species, that, hatch, with, gill, remnants, still, present, short, lived, and, only, leaves, behind, a, gill, slit, for, species, with, scales, under, their, skin, the, scales, does, not, form, before, during, metamorphosis, the, ringed, caecilian, siphonops, annulatus, has, developed, a, unique, adaptation, for, the, purposes, of, reproduction, the, progeny, feed, on, a, skin, layer, that, is, specially, developed, by, the, adult, in, a, phenomenon, known, as, maternal, dermatophagy, the, brood, feed, as, a, batch, for, about, seven, minutes, at, intervals, of, approximately, three, days, which, gives, the, skin, an, opportunity, to, regenerate, meanwhile, they, have, been, observed, to, ingest, fluid, exuded, from, the, maternal, cloaca, the, care, of, offspring, among, amphibians, has, been, little, studied, but, in, general, the, larger, the, number, of, eggs, in, a, batch, the, less, likely, it, is, that, any, degree, of, parental, care, takes, place, nevertheless, it, is, estimated, that, in, up, to, 20, of, amphibian, species, one, or, both, adults, play, some, role, in, the, care, of, the, young, those, species, that, breed, in, smaller, water, bodies, or, other, specialised, habitats, tend, to, have, complex, patterns, of, behaviour, in, the, care, of, their, young, many, woodland, salamanders, lay, clutches, of, eggs, under, dead, logs, or, stones, on, land, the, black, mountain, salamander, desmognathus, welteri, does, this, the, mother, brooding, the, eggs, and, guarding, them, from, predation, as, the, embryos, feed, on, the, yolks, of, their, eggs, when, fully, developed, they, break, their, way, out, of, the, egg, capsules, and, disperse, as, juvenile, salamanders, the, male, hellbender, a, primitive, salamander, excavates, an, underwater, nest, and, encourages, females, to, lay, there, the, male, then, guards, the, site, for, the, two, or, three, months, before, the, eggs, hatch, using, body, undulations, to, fan, the, eggs, and, increase, their, supply, of, oxygen, the, male, colostethus, subpunctatus, a, tiny, frog, protects, the, egg, cluster, which, is, hidden, under, a, stone, or, log, when, the, eggs, hatch, the, male, transports, the, tadpoles, on, his, back, stuck, there, by, a, mucous, secretion, to, a, temporary, pool, where, he, dips, himself, into, the, water, and, the, tadpoles, drop, off, the, male, midwife, toad, alytes, obstetricans, winds, egg, strings, round, his, thighs, and, carries, the, eggs, around, for, up, to, eight, weeks, he, keeps, them, moist, and, when, they, are, ready, to, hatch, he, visits, a, pond, or, ditch, and, releases, the, tadpoles, the, female, gastric, brooding, frog, rheobatrachus, spp, reared, larvae, in, her, stomach, after, swallowing, either, the, eggs, or, hatchlings, however, this, stage, was, never, observed, before, the, species, became, extinct, the, tadpoles, secrete, a, hormone, that, inhibits, digestion, in, the, mother, whilst, they, develop, by, consuming, their, very, large, yolk, supply, the, pouched, frog, assa, darlingtoni, lays, eggs, on, the, ground, when, they, hatch, the, male, carries, the, tadpoles, around, in, brood, pouches, on, his, hind, legs, the, aquatic, surinam, toad, pipa, pipa, raises, its, young, in, pores, on, its, back, where, they, remain, until, metamorphosis, the, granular, poison, frog, oophaga, granulifera, is, typical, of, a, number, of, tree, frogs, in, the, poison, dart, frog, family, dendrobatidae, its, eggs, are, laid, on, the, forest, floor, and, when, they, hatch, the, tadpoles, are, carried, one, by, one, on, the, back, of, an, adult, to, a, suitable, water, filled, crevice, such, as, the, axil, of, a, leaf, or, the, rosette, of, a, bromeliad, the, female, visits, the, nursery, sites, regularly, and, deposits, unfertilised, eggs, in, the, water, and, these, are, consumed, by, the, tadpoles, amphibians, are, notable, among, vertebrates, for, their, diversity, of, chromosomes, and, genomes, the, karyotypes, chromosomes, have, been, determined, for, at, least, 1, 193, 14, 5, of, the, 8, 200, known, diploid, species, including, 963, anurans, 209, salamanders, and, 21, caecilians, generally, the, karyotypes, of, diploid, amphibians, are, characterized, by, 20, 26, bi, armed, chromosomes, amphibians, have, also, very, large, genomes, compared, to, other, taxa, of, vertebrates, and, corresponding, variation, in, genome, size, c, value, picograms, of, dna, in, haploid, nuclei, the, genome, sizes, range, from, 0, 95, to, 11, 5, pg, in, frogs, from, 13, 89, to, 120, 56, pg, in, salamanders, and, from, 2, 94, to, 11, 78, pg, in, caecilians, the, large, genome, sizes, have, prevented, whole, genome, sequencing, of, amphibians, although, a, number, of, genomes, have, been, published, recently, the, 1, 7gb, draft, genome, of, xenopus, tropicalis, was, the, first, to, be, reported, for, amphibians, in, 2010, compared, to, some, salamanders, this, frog, genome, is, tiny, for, instance, the, genome, of, the, mexican, axolotl, turned, out, to, be, 32, gb, which, is, more, than, 10, times, larger, than, the, human, genome, 3gb, with, a, few, exceptions, adult, amphibians, are, predators, feeding, on, virtually, anything, that, moves, that, they, can, swallow, the, diet, mostly, consists, of, small, prey, that, do, not, move, too, fast, such, as, beetles, caterpillars, earthworms, and, spiders, the, sirens, siren, spp, often, ingest, aquatic, plant, material, with, the, invertebrates, on, which, they, feed, and, a, brazilian, tree, frog, xenohyla, truncata, includes, a, large, quantity, of, fruit, in, its, diet, the, mexican, burrowing, toad, rhinophrynus, dorsalis, has, a, specially, adapted, tongue, for, picking, up, ants, and, termites, it, projects, it, with, the, tip, foremost, whereas, other, frogs, flick, out, the, rear, part, first, their, tongues, being, hinged, at, the, front, food, is, mostly, selected, by, sight, even, in, conditions, of, dim, light, movement, of, the, prey, triggers, a, feeding, response, frogs, have, been, caught, on, fish, hooks, baited, with, red, flannel, and, green, frogs, rana, clamitans, have, been, found, with, stomachs, full, of, elm, seeds, that, they, had, seen, floating, past, toads, salamanders, and, caecilians, also, use, smell, to, detect, prey, this, response, is, mostly, secondary, because, salamanders, have, been, observed, to, remain, stationary, near, odoriferous, prey, but, only, feed, if, it, moves, cave, dwelling, amphibians, normally, hunt, by, smell, some, salamanders, seem, to, have, learned, to, recognize, immobile, prey, when, it, has, no, smell, even, in, complete, darkness, amphibians, usually, swallow, food, whole, but, may, chew, it, lightly, first, to, subdue, it, they, typically, have, small, hinged, pedicellate, teeth, a, feature, unique, to, amphibians, the, base, and, crown, of, these, are, composed, of, dentine, separated, by, an, uncalcified, layer, and, they, are, replaced, at, intervals, salamanders, caecilians, and, some, frogs, have, one, or, two, rows, of, teeth, in, both, jaws, but, some, frogs, rana, spp, lack, teeth, in, the, lower, jaw, and, toads, bufo, spp, have, no, teeth, in, many, amphibians, there, are, also, vomerine, teeth, attached, to, a, facial, bone, in, the, roof, of, the, mouth, the, tiger, salamander, ambystoma, tigrinum, is, typical, of, the, frogs, and, salamanders, that, hide, under, cover, ready, to, ambush, unwary, invertebrates, others, amphibians, such, as, the, bufo, spp, toads, actively, search, for, prey, while, the, argentine, horned, frog, ceratophrys, ornata, lures, inquisitive, prey, closer, by, raising, its, hind, feet, over, its, back, and, vibrating, its, yellow, toes, among, leaf, litter, frogs, in, panama, frogs, that, actively, hunt, prey, have, narrow, mouths, and, are, slim, often, brightly, coloured, and, toxic, while, ambushers, have, wide, mouths, and, are, broad, and, well, camouflaged, caecilians, do, not, flick, their, tongues, but, catch, their, prey, by, grabbing, it, with, their, slightly, backward, pointing, teeth, the, struggles, of, the, prey, and, further, jaw, movements, work, it, inwards, and, the, caecilian, usually, retreats, into, its, burrow, the, subdued, prey, is, gulped, down, whole, when, they, are, newly, hatched, frog, larvae, feed, on, the, yolk, of, the, egg, when, this, is, exhausted, some, move, on, to, feed, on, bacteria, algal, crusts, detritus, and, raspings, from, submerged, plants, water, is, drawn, in, through, their, mouths, which, are, usually, at, the, bottom, of, their, heads, and, passes, through, branchial, food, traps, between, their, mouths, and, their, gills, where, fine, particles, are, trapped, in, mucus, and, filtered, out, others, have, specialised, mouthparts, consisting, of, a, horny, beak, edged, by, several, rows, of, labial, teeth, they, scrape, and, bite, food, of, many, kinds, as, well, as, stirring, up, the, bottom, sediment, filtering, out, larger, particles, with, the, papillae, around, their, mouths, some, such, as, the, spadefoot, toads, have, strong, biting, jaws, and, are, carnivorous, or, even, cannibalistic, the, calls, made, by, caecilians, and, salamanders, are, limited, to, occasional, soft, squeaks, grunts, or, hisses, and, have, not, been, much, studied, a, clicking, sound, sometimes, produced, by, caecilians, may, be, a, means, of, orientation, as, in, bats, or, a, form, of, communication, most, salamanders, are, considered, voiceless, but, the, california, giant, salamander, dicamptodon, ensatus, has, vocal, cords, and, can, produce, a, rattling, or, barking, sound, some, species, of, salamander, emit, a, quiet, squeak, or, yelp, if, attacked, frogs, are, much, more, vocal, especially, during, the, breeding, season, when, they, use, their, voices, to, attract, mates, the, presence, of, a, particular, species, in, an, area, may, be, more, easily, discerned, by, its, characteristic, call, than, by, a, fleeting, glimpse, of, the, animal, itself, in, most, species, the, sound, is, produced, by, expelling, air, from, the, lungs, over, the, vocal, cords, into, an, air, sac, or, sacs, in, the, throat, or, at, the, corner, of, the, mouth, this, may, distend, like, a, balloon, and, acts, as, a, resonator, helping, to, transfer, the, sound, to, the, atmosphere, or, the, water, at, times, when, the, animal, is, submerged, the, main, vocalisation, is, the, male, s, loud, advertisement, call, which, seeks, to, both, encourage, a, female, to, approach, and, discourage, other, males, from, intruding, on, its, territory, this, call, is, modified, to, a, quieter, courtship, call, on, the, approach, of, a, female, or, to, a, more, aggressive, version, if, a, male, intruder, draws, near, calling, carries, the, risk, of, attracting, predators, and, involves, the, expenditure, of, much, energy, other, calls, include, those, given, by, a, female, in, response, to, the, advertisement, call, and, a, release, call, given, by, a, male, or, female, during, unwanted, attempts, at, amplexus, when, a, frog, is, attacked, a, distress, or, fright, call, is, emitted, often, resembling, a, scream, the, usually, nocturnal, cuban, tree, frog, osteopilus, septentrionalis, produces, a, rain, call, when, there, is, rainfall, during, daylight, hours, little, is, known, of, the, territorial, behaviour, of, caecilians, but, some, frogs, and, salamanders, defend, home, ranges, these, are, usually, feeding, breeding, or, sheltering, sites, males, normally, exhibit, such, behaviour, though, in, some, species, females, and, even, juveniles, are, also, involved, although, in, many, frog, species, females, are, larger, than, males, this, is, not, the, case, in, most, species, where, males, are, actively, involved, in, territorial, defence, some, of, these, have, specific, adaptations, such, as, enlarged, teeth, for, biting, or, spines, on, the, chest, arms, or, thumbs, in, salamanders, defence, of, a, territory, involves, adopting, an, aggressive, posture, and, if, necessary, attacking, the, intruder, this, may, involve, snapping, chasing, and, sometimes, biting, occasionally, causing, the, loss, of, a, tail, the, behaviour, of, red, back, salamanders, plethodon, cinereus, has, been, much, studied, 91, of, marked, individuals, that, were, later, recaptured, were, within, a, metre, yard, of, their, original, daytime, retreat, under, a, log, or, rock, a, similar, proportion, when, moved, experimentally, a, distance, of, 30, metres, 98, ft, found, their, way, back, to, their, home, base, the, salamanders, left, odour, marks, around, their, territories, which, averaged, 0, 16, to, 0, 33, square, metres, 1, 7, to, 3, 6, sq, ft, in, size, and, were, sometimes, inhabited, by, a, male, and, female, pair, these, deterred, the, intrusion, of, others, and, delineated, the, boundaries, between, neighbouring, areas, much, of, their, behaviour, seemed, stereotyped, and, did, not, involve, any, actual, contact, between, individuals, an, aggressive, posture, involved, raising, the, body, off, the, ground, and, glaring, at, the, opponent, who, often, turned, away, submissively, if, the, intruder, persisted, a, biting, lunge, was, usually, launched, at, either, the, tail, region, or, the, naso, labial, grooves, damage, to, either, of, these, areas, can, reduce, the, fitness, of, the, rival, either, because, of, the, need, to, regenerate, tissue, or, because, it, impairs, its, ability, to, detect, food, in, frogs, male, territorial, behaviour, is, often, observed, at, breeding, locations, calling, is, both, an, announcement, of, ownership, of, part, of, this, resource, and, an, advertisement, call, to, potential, mates, in, general, a, deeper, voice, represents, a, heavier, and, more, powerful, individual, and, this, may, be, sufficient, to, prevent, intrusion, by, smaller, males, much, energy, is, used, in, the, vocalization, and, it, takes, a, toll, on, the, territory, holder, who, may, be, displaced, by, a, fitter, rival, if, he, tires, there, is, a, tendency, for, males, to, tolerate, the, holders, of, neighbouring, territories, while, vigorously, attacking, unknown, intruders, holders, of, territories, have, a, home, advantage, and, usually, come, off, better, in, an, encounter, between, two, similar, sized, frogs, if, threats, are, insufficient, chest, to, chest, tussles, may, take, place, fighting, methods, include, pushing, and, shoving, deflating, the, opponent, s, vocal, sac, seizing, him, by, the, head, jumping, on, his, back, biting, chasing, splashing, and, ducking, him, under, the, water, amphibians, have, soft, bodies, with, thin, skins, and, lack, claws, defensive, armour, or, spines, nevertheless, they, have, evolved, various, defence, mechanisms, to, keep, themselves, alive, the, first, line, of, defence, in, salamanders, and, frogs, is, the, mucous, secretion, that, they, produce, this, keeps, their, skin, moist, and, makes, them, slippery, and, difficult, to, grip, the, secretion, is, often, sticky, and, distasteful, or, toxic, snakes, have, been, observed, yawning, and, gaping, when, trying, to, swallow, african, clawed, frogs, xenopus, laevis, which, gives, the, frogs, an, opportunity, to, escape, caecilians, have, been, little, studied, in, this, respect, but, the, cayenne, caecilian, typhlonectes, compressicauda, produces, toxic, mucus, that, has, killed, predatory, fish, in, a, feeding, experiment, in, brazil, in, some, salamanders, the, skin, is, poisonous, the, rough, skinned, newt, taricha, granulosa, from, north, america, and, other, members, of, its, genus, contain, the, neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, ttx, the, most, toxic, non, protein, substance, known, and, almost, identical, to, that, produced, by, pufferfish, handling, the, newts, does, not, cause, harm, but, ingestion, of, even, the, most, minute, amounts, of, the, skin, is, deadly, in, feeding, trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, were, all, found, to, be, susceptible, the, only, predators, with, some, tolerance, to, the, poison, are, certain, populations, of, common, garter, snake, thamnophis, sirtalis, in, locations, where, both, snake, and, salamander, co, exist, the, snakes, have, developed, immunity, through, genetic, changes, and, they, feed, on, the, amphibians, with, impunity, coevolution, occurs, with, the, newt, increasing, its, toxic, capabilities, at, the, same, rate, as, the, snake, further, develops, its, immunity, some, frogs, and, toads, are, toxic, the, main, poison, glands, being, at, the, side, of, the, neck, and, under, the, warts, on, the, back, these, regions, are, presented, to, the, attacking, animal, and, their, secretions, may, be, foul, tasting, or, cause, various, physical, or, neurological, symptoms, altogether, over, 200, toxins, have, been, isolated, from, the, limited, number, of, amphibian, species, that, have, been, investigated, poisonous, species, often, use, bright, colouring, to, warn, potential, predators, of, their, toxicity, these, warning, colours, tend, to, be, red, or, yellow, combined, with, black, with, the, fire, salamander, salamandra, salamandra, being, an, example, once, a, predator, has, sampled, one, of, these, it, is, likely, to, remember, the, colouration, next, time, it, encounters, a, similar, animal, in, some, species, such, as, the, fire, bellied, toad, bombina, spp, the, warning, colouration, is, on, the, belly, and, these, animals, adopt, a, defensive, pose, when, attacked, exhibiting, their, bright, colours, to, the, predator, the, frog, allobates, zaparo, is, not, poisonous, but, mimics, the, appearance, of, other, toxic, species, in, its, locality, a, strategy, that, may, deceive, predators, many, amphibians, are, nocturnal, and, hide, during, the, day, thereby, avoiding, diurnal, predators, that, hunt, by, sight, other, amphibians, use, camouflage, to, avoid, being, detected, they, have, various, colourings, such, as, mottled, browns, greys, and, olives, to, blend, into, the, background, some, salamanders, adopt, defensive, poses, when, faced, by, a, potential, predator, such, as, the, north, american, northern, short, tailed, shrew, blarina, brevicauda, their, bodies, writhe, and, they, raise, and, lash, their, tails, which, makes, it, difficult, for, the, predator, to, avoid, contact, with, their, poison, producing, granular, glands, a, few, salamanders, will, autotomise, their, tails, when, attacked, sacrificing, this, part, of, their, anatomy, to, enable, them, to, escape, the, tail, may, have, a, constriction, at, its, base, to, allow, it, to, be, easily, detached, the, tail, is, regenerated, later, but, the, energy, cost, to, the, animal, of, replacing, it, is, significant, some, frogs, and, toads, inflate, themselves, to, make, themselves, look, large, and, fierce, and, some, spadefoot, toads, pelobates, spp, scream, and, leap, towards, the, attacker, giant, salamanders, of, the, genus, andrias, as, well, as, ceratophrine, and, pyxicephalus, frogs, possess, sharp, teeth, and, are, capable, of, drawing, blood, with, a, defensive, bite, the, blackbelly, salamander, desmognathus, quadramaculatus, can, bite, an, attacking, common, garter, snake, thamnophis, sirtalis, two, or, three, times, its, size, on, the, head, and, often, manages, to, escape, in, amphibians, there, is, evidence, of, habituation, associative, learning, through, both, classical, and, instrumental, learning, and, discrimination, abilities, amphibians, are, widely, considered, to, be, sentient, able, to, feel, emotions, such, as, anxiety, and, fear, in, one, experiment, when, offered, live, fruit, flies, drosophila, virilis, salamanders, chose, the, larger, of, 1, vs, 2, and, 2, vs, 3, frogs, can, distinguish, between, low, numbers, 1, vs, 2, 2, vs, 3, but, not, 3, vs, 4, and, large, numbers, 3, vs, 6, 4, vs, 8, but, not, 4, vs, 6, of, prey, this, is, irrespective, of, other, characteristics, i, e, surface, area, volume, weight, and, movement, although, discrimination, among, large, numbers, may, be, based, on, surface, area, dramatic, declines, in, amphibian, populations, including, population, crashes, and, mass, localized, extinction, have, been, noted, since, the, late, 1980s, from, locations, all, over, the, world, and, amphibian, declines, are, thus, perceived, to, be, one, of, the, most, critical, threats, to, global, biodiversity, in, 2004, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, reported, stating, that, currently, birds, mammals, and, amphibians, extinction, rates, were, at, minimum, 48, times, greater, than, natural, extinction, rates, possibly, 1, 024, times, higher, in, 2006, there, were, believed, to, be, 4, 035, species, of, amphibians, that, depended, on, water, at, some, stage, during, their, life, cycle, of, these, 1, 356, 33, 6, were, considered, to, be, threatened, and, this, figure, is, likely, to, be, an, underestimate, because, it, excludes, 1, 427, species, for, which, there, was, insufficient, data, to, assess, their, status, a, number, of, causes, are, believed, to, be, involved, including, habitat, destruction, and, modification, over, exploitation, pollution, introduced, species, global, warming, endocrine, disrupting, pollutants, destruction, of, the, ozone, layer, ultraviolet, radiation, has, shown, to, be, especially, damaging, to, the, skin, eyes, and, eggs, of, amphibians, and, diseases, like, chytridiomycosis, however, many, of, the, causes, of, amphibian, declines, are, still, poorly, understood, and, are, a, topic, of, ongoing, discussion, any, decline, in, amphibian, numbers, will, affect, the, patterns, of, predation, the, loss, of, carnivorous, species, near, the, top, of, the, food, chain, will, upset, the, delicate, ecosystem, balance, and, may, cause, dramatic, increases, in, opportunistic, species, predators, that, feed, on, amphibians, are, affected, by, their, decline, the, western, terrestrial, garter, snake, thamnophis, elegans, in, california, is, largely, aquatic, and, depends, heavily, on, two, species, of, frog, that, are, decreasing, in, numbers, the, yosemite, toad, bufo, canorus, and, the, mountain, yellow, legged, frog, rana, muscosa, putting, the, snake, s, future, at, risk, if, the, snake, were, to, become, scarce, this, would, affect, birds, of, prey, and, other, predators, that, feed, on, it, meanwhile, in, the, ponds, and, lakes, fewer, frogs, means, fewer, tadpoles, these, normally, play, an, important, role, in, controlling, the, growth, of, algae, and, also, forage, on, detritus, that, accumulates, as, sediment, on, the, bottom, a, reduction, in, the, number, of, tadpoles, may, lead, to, an, overgrowth, of, algae, resulting, in, depletion, of, oxygen, in, the, water, when, the, algae, later, die, and, decompose, aquatic, invertebrates, and, fish, might, then, die, and, there, would, be, unpredictable, ecological, consequences, the, decline, in, amphibian, and, reptile, populations, has, led, to, an, awareness, of, the, effects, of, pesticides, on, reptiles, and, amphibians, in, the, past, the, argument, that, amphibians, or, reptiles, were, more, susceptible, to, any, chemical, contamination, than, any, land, aquatic, vertebrate, was, not, supported, by, research, until, recently, amphibians, and, reptiles, have, complex, life, cycles, live, in, different, climate, and, ecological, zones, and, are, more, vulnerable, to, chemical, exposure, certain, pesticides, such, as, organophosphates, neonicotinoids, and, carbamates, react, via, cholinesterase, inhibition, cholinesterase, is, an, enzyme, that, causes, the, hydrolysis, of, acetylcholine, an, excitatory, neurotransmitter, that, is, abundant, in, the, nervous, system, ache, inhibitors, are, either, reversible, or, irreversible, and, carbamates, are, safer, than, organophosphorus, insecticides, which, are, more, likely, to, cause, cholinergic, poisoning, reptile, exposure, to, an, ache, inhibitory, pesticide, may, result, in, disruption, of, neural, function, in, reptiles, the, buildup, of, these, inhibitory, effects, on, motor, performance, such, as, food, consumption, and, other, activities, the, amphibian, specialist, group, of, the, iucn, is, spearheading, efforts, to, implement, a, comprehensive, global, strategy, for, amphibian, conservation, amphibian, ark, is, an, organization, that, was, formed, to, implement, the, ex, situ, conservation, recommendations, of, this, plan, and, they, have, been, working, with, zoos, and, aquaria, around, the, world, encouraging, them, to, create, assurance, colonies, of, threatened, amphibians, one, such, project, is, the, panama, amphibian, rescue, and, conservation, project, that, built, on, existing, conservation, efforts, in, panama, to, create, a, country, wide, response, to, the, threat, of, chytridiomycosis, another, measure, would, be, to, stop, exploitation, of, frogs, for, human, consumption, in, the, middle, east, a, growing, appetite, for, eating, frog, legs, and, the, consequent, gathering, of, them, for, food, was, already, linked, to, an, increase, in, mosquitoes, and, thus, has, direct, consequences, for, human, health
