foodborne, illness, also, known, as, foodborne, disease, and, food, poisoning, is, any, illness, resulting, from, the, contamination, of, food, by, pathogenic, bacteria, viruses, or, parasites, as, well, as, prions, the, agents, of, mad, cow, disease, and, toxins, such, as, aflatoxins, in, peanuts, poisonous, mushrooms, and, various, species, of, beans, that, have, not, been, boiled, for, at, least, 10, minutes, symptoms, vary, depending, on, the, cause, they, often, include, vomiting, fever, and, aches, and, may, include, diarrhea, bouts, of, vomiting, can, be, repeated, with, an, extended, delay, in, between, this, is, because, even, if, infected, food, was, eliminated, from, the, stomach, in, the, first, bout, microbes, like, bacteria, if, applicable, can, pass, through, the, stomach, into, the, intestine, and, begin, to, multiply, some, types, of, microbes, stay, in, the, intestine, for, contaminants, requiring, an, incubation, period, symptoms, may, not, manifest, for, hours, to, days, depending, on, the, cause, and, on, the, quantity, of, consumption, longer, incubation, periods, tend, to, cause, those, affected, to, not, associate, the, symptoms, with, the, item, consumed, so, they, may, misattribute, the, symptoms, to, gastroenteritis, for, example, foodborne, illness, usually, arises, from, improper, handling, preparation, or, food, storage, good, hygiene, practices, before, during, and, after, food, preparation, can, reduce, the, chances, of, contracting, an, illness, there, is, a, consensus, in, the, public, health, community, that, regular, hand, washing, is, one, of, the, most, effective, defenses, against, the, spread, of, foodborne, illness, the, action, of, monitoring, food, to, ensure, that, it, will, not, cause, foodborne, illness, is, known, as, food, safety, foodborne, disease, can, also, be, caused, by, a, large, variety, of, toxins, that, affect, the, environment, furthermore, foodborne, illness, can, be, caused, by, a, number, of, chemicals, such, as, pesticides, medicines, and, natural, toxic, substances, such, as, vomitoxin, poisonous, mushrooms, or, reef, fish, bacteria, are, a, common, cause, of, foodborne, illness, in, 2000, the, united, kingdom, reported, the, individual, bacteria, involved, as, the, following, campylobacter, jejuni, 77, 3, salmonella, 20, 9, escherichia, coli, o157, h7, 1, 4, and, all, others, less, than, 0, 56, in, the, past, bacterial, infections, were, thought, to, be, more, prevalent, because, few, places, had, the, capability, to, test, for, norovirus, and, no, active, surveillance, was, being, done, for, this, particular, agent, toxins, from, bacterial, infections, are, delayed, because, the, bacteria, need, time, to, multiply, as, a, result, symptoms, associated, with, intoxication, are, usually, not, seen, until, 12, 72, hours, or, more, after, eating, contaminated, food, however, in, some, cases, such, as, staphylococcal, food, poisoning, the, onset, of, illness, can, be, as, soon, as, 30, minutes, after, ingesting, contaminated, food, a, 2022, study, concluded, that, washing, uncooked, chicken, could, increase, the, risk, of, pathogen, transfer, and, that, specific, washing, conditions, can, decrease, the, risk, of, transfer, most, common, bacterial, foodborne, pathogens, are, other, common, bacterial, foodborne, pathogens, are, less, common, bacterial, agents, in, addition, to, disease, caused, by, direct, bacterial, infection, some, foodborne, illnesses, are, caused, by, enterotoxins, exotoxins, targeting, the, intestines, enterotoxins, can, produce, illness, even, when, the, microbes, that, produced, them, have, been, killed, symptom, onset, varies, with, the, toxin, but, may, be, rapid, in, onset, as, in, the, case, of, enterotoxins, of, staphylococcus, aureus, in, which, symptoms, appear, in, one, to, six, hours, this, causes, intense, vomiting, including, or, not, including, diarrhea, resulting, in, staphylococcal, enteritis, and, staphylococcal, enterotoxins, most, commonly, staphylococcal, enterotoxin, a, but, also, including, staphylococcal, enterotoxin, b, are, the, most, commonly, reported, enterotoxins, although, cases, of, poisoning, are, likely, underestimated, it, occurs, mainly, in, cooked, and, processed, foods, due, to, competition, with, other, biota, in, raw, foods, and, humans, are, the, main, cause, of, contamination, as, a, substantial, percentage, of, humans, are, persistent, carriers, of, s, aureus, the, cdc, has, estimated, about, 240, 000, cases, per, year, in, the, united, states, the, rare, but, potentially, deadly, disease, botulism, occurs, when, the, anaerobic, bacterium, clostridium, botulinum, grows, in, improperly, canned, low, acid, foods, and, produces, botulin, a, powerful, paralytic, toxin, pseudoalteromonas, tetraodonis, certain, species, of, pseudomonas, and, vibrio, and, some, other, bacteria, produce, the, lethal, tetrodotoxin, which, is, present, in, the, tissues, of, some, living, animal, species, rather, than, being, a, product, of, decomposition, scandinavian, outbreaks, of, yersinia, enterocolitica, have, recently, increased, to, an, annual, basis, connected, to, the, non, canonical, contamination, of, pre, washed, salad, governments, have, the, primary, mandate, of, ensuring, safe, food, for, all, however, all, actors, in, the, food, chain, are, responsible, to, ensure, only, safe, food, reaches, the, consumer, thus, preventing, foodborne, illnesses, this, is, achieved, through, the, implementation, of, strict, hygiene, rules, and, a, public, veterinary, and, phytosanitary, service, that, monitors, animal, products, throughout, the, food, chain, from, farming, to, delivery, in, shops, and, restaurants, this, regulation, includes, in, august, 2006, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, approved, phage, therapy, which, involves, spraying, meat, with, viruses, that, infect, bacteria, and, thus, preventing, infection, this, has, raised, concerns, because, without, mandatory, labeling, consumers, would, not, know, that, meat, and, poultry, products, have, been, treated, with, the, spray, at, home, prevention, mainly, consists, of, good, food, safety, practices, many, forms, of, bacterial, poisoning, can, be, prevented, by, cooking, food, sufficiently, and, either, eating, it, quickly, or, refrigerating, it, effectively, many, toxins, however, are, not, destroyed, by, heat, treatment, techniques, that, help, prevent, food, borne, illness, in, the, kitchen, are, hand, washing, rinsing, produce, preventing, cross, contamination, proper, storage, and, maintaining, cooking, temperatures, in, general, freezing, or, refrigerating, prevents, virtually, all, bacteria, from, growing, and, heating, food, sufficiently, kills, parasites, viruses, and, most, bacteria, bacteria, grow, most, rapidly, at, the, range, of, temperatures, between, 40, and, 140, f, 4, and, 60, c, called, the, danger, zone, storing, food, below, or, above, the, danger, zone, can, effectively, limit, the, production, of, toxins, for, storing, leftovers, the, food, must, be, put, in, shallow, containers, for, quick, cooling, and, must, be, refrigerated, within, two, hours, when, food, is, reheated, it, must, reach, an, internal, temperature, of, 165, f, 74, c, or, until, hot, or, steaming, to, kill, bacteria, the, term, alimentary, mycotoxicosis, refers, to, the, effect, of, poisoning, by, mycotoxins, through, food, consumption, the, term, mycotoxin, is, usually, reserved, for, the, toxic, chemical, compounds, naturally, produced, by, fungi, that, readily, colonize, crops, under, given, temperature, and, moisture, conditions, mycotoxins, can, have, important, effects, on, human, and, animal, health, for, example, an, outbreak, which, occurred, in, the, uk, during, 1960, caused, the, death, of, 100, 000, turkeys, which, had, consumed, aflatoxin, contaminated, peanut, meal, in, the, ussr, in, world, war, ii, 5, 000, people, died, due, to, alimentary, toxic, aleukia, ala, in, kenya, mycotoxins, led, to, the, death, of, 125, people, in, 2004, after, consumption, of, contaminated, grains, in, animals, mycotoxicosis, targets, organ, systems, such, as, liver, and, digestive, system, other, effects, can, include, reduced, productivity, and, suppression, of, the, immune, system, thus, pre, disposing, the, animals, to, other, secondary, infections, the, common, foodborne, mycotoxins, include, viral, infections, make, up, perhaps, one, third, of, cases, of, food, poisoning, in, developed, countries, in, the, us, more, than, 50, of, cases, are, viral, and, noroviruses, are, the, most, common, foodborne, illness, causing, 57, of, outbreaks, in, 2004, foodborne, viral, infection, are, usually, of, intermediate, 1, 3, days, incubation, period, causing, illnesses, which, are, self, limited, in, otherwise, healthy, individuals, they, are, similar, to, the, bacterial, forms, described, above, most, foodborne, parasites, are, zoonoses, several, foods, can, naturally, contain, toxins, many, of, which, are, not, produced, by, bacteria, plants, in, particular, may, be, toxic, animals, which, are, naturally, poisonous, to, eat, are, rare, in, evolutionary, terms, animals, can, escape, being, eaten, by, fleeing, plants, can, use, only, passive, defenses, such, as, poisons, and, distasteful, substances, for, example, capsaicin, in, chili, peppers, and, pungent, sulfur, compounds, in, garlic, and, onions, most, animal, poisons, are, not, synthesised, by, the, animal, but, acquired, by, eating, poisonous, plants, to, which, the, animal, is, immune, or, by, bacterial, action, some, plants, contain, substances, which, are, toxic, in, large, doses, but, have, therapeutic, properties, in, appropriate, dosages, ptomaine, poisoning, was, a, myth, that, persisted, in, the, public, consciousness, in, newspaper, headlines, and, legal, cases, as, an, official, diagnosis, decades, after, it, had, been, scientifically, disproven, in, the, 1910s, in, the, 19th, century, the, italian, chemist, francesco, selmi, of, bologna, introduced, the, generic, name, ptomaine, from, greek, pt, ma, fall, fallen, body, corpse, for, alkaloids, found, in, decaying, animal, and, vegetable, matter, especially, as, reflected, in, their, names, putrescine, and, cadaverine, the, 1892, merck, s, bulletin, stated, we, name, such, products, of, bacterial, origin, ptomaines, and, the, special, alkaloid, produced, by, the, comma, bacillus, is, variously, named, cadaverine, putrescine, etc, while, the, lancet, stated, the, chemical, ferments, produced, in, the, system, the, ptomaines, which, may, exercise, so, disastrous, an, influence, it, is, now, known, that, the, disastrous, influence, is, due, to, the, direct, action, of, bacteria, and, only, slightly, due, to, the, alkaloids, thus, the, use, of, the, phrase, ptomaine, poisoning, is, now, largely, obsolete, at, a, communist, political, convention, in, massillon, ohio, and, aboard, a, cruise, ship, in, washington, d, c, hundreds, of, people, were, sickened, in, separate, incidents, by, tainted, potato, salad, during, a, single, week, in, 1932, drawing, national, attention, to, the, dangers, of, so, called, ptomaine, poisoning, in, the, pages, of, the, american, news, weekly, time, in, 1944, another, newspaper, article, reported, that, over, 150, people, in, chicago, were, hospitalized, with, ptomaine, poisoning, apparently, from, rice, pudding, served, by, a, restaurant, chain, the, delay, between, the, consumption, of, contaminated, food, and, the, appearance, of, the, first, symptoms, of, illness, is, called, the, incubation, period, this, ranges, from, hours, to, days, and, rarely, months, or, even, years, such, as, in, the, case, of, listeriosis, or, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, depending, on, the, agent, and, on, how, much, was, consumed, if, symptoms, occur, within, one, to, six, hours, after, eating, the, food, it, suggests, that, it, is, caused, by, a, bacterial, toxin, or, a, chemical, rather, than, live, bacteria, the, long, incubation, period, of, many, foodborne, illnesses, tends, to, cause, those, affected, to, attribute, their, symptoms, to, gastroenteritis, during, the, incubation, period, microbes, pass, through, the, stomach, into, the, intestine, attach, to, the, cells, lining, the, intestinal, walls, and, begin, to, multiply, there, some, types, of, microbes, stay, in, the, intestine, some, produce, a, toxin, that, is, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, and, some, can, directly, invade, the, deeper, body, tissues, the, symptoms, produced, depend, on, the, type, of, microbe, the, infectious, dose, is, the, amount, of, agent, that, must, be, consumed, to, give, rise, to, symptoms, of, foodborne, illness, and, varies, according, to, the, agent, and, the, consumer, s, age, and, overall, health, pathogens, vary, in, minimum, infectious, dose, for, example, shigella, sonnei, has, a, low, estimated, minimum, dose, of, 500, colony, forming, units, cfu, while, staphylococcus, aureus, has, a, relatively, high, estimate, in, the, case, of, salmonella, a, relatively, large, inoculum, of, 1, million, to, 1, billion, organisms, is, necessary, to, produce, symptoms, in, healthy, human, volunteers, as, salmonellae, are, very, sensitive, to, acid, an, unusually, high, stomach, ph, level, low, acidity, greatly, reduces, the, number, of, bacteria, required, to, cause, symptoms, by, a, factor, of, between, 10, and, 100, foodborne, illness, often, occurs, as, travelers, diarrhea, in, persons, whose, gut, microbiota, is, unaccustomed, to, organisms, endemic, to, the, visited, region, this, effect, of, microbiologic, na, vet, is, compounded, by, any, food, safety, lapses, in, the, food, s, preparation, asymptomatic, subclinical, infection, may, help, spread, these, diseases, particularly, staphylococcus, aureus, campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, enterobacter, vibrio, cholerae, and, yersinia, for, example, as, of, 1984, it, was, estimated, that, in, the, united, states, 200, 000, people, were, asymptomatic, carriers, of, salmonella, globally, infants, are, a, group, that, is, especially, vulnerable, to, foodborne, disease, the, world, health, organization, has, issued, recommendations, for, the, preparation, use, and, storage, of, prepared, formulas, breastfeeding, remains, the, best, preventive, measure, for, protection, from, foodborne, infections, in, infants, a, cdc, report, for, the, period, 2017, 2019, found, that, 41, of, outbreaks, at, restaurants, were, caused, by, a, sick, employee, contributory, factors, identified, included, lack, of, written, policy, compliance, with, fda, recommendations, for, identifying, red, flag, symptoms, glove, use, and, hand, washing, lack, of, paid, sick, leave, at, the, majority, of, establishments, and, social, pressure, to, come, to, work, even, while, sick, the, remaining, outbreaks, had, a, variety, of, causes, including, inadequate, cooking, improper, temperature, and, cross, contamination, in, the, united, states, using, foodnet, data, from, 2000, to, 2007, the, cdc, estimated, there, were, 47, 8, million, foodborne, illnesses, per, year, 16, 000, cases, for, 100, 000, inhabitants, with, 9, 4, million, of, these, caused, by, 31, known, identified, pathogens, according, to, a, 2012, report, from, the, food, standards, agency, there, were, around, a, million, cases, of, foodborne, illness, per, year, 1, 580, cases, for, 100, 000, inhabitants, this, data, pertains, to, reported, medical, cases, of, 23, specific, pathogens, in, the, 1990s, as, opposed, to, total, population, estimates, of, all, foodborne, illness, for, the, united, states, in, france, for, 735, 590, to, 769, 615, cases, of, infection, identified, as, being, with, the, 23, specific, pathogens, 238, 836, to, 269, 085, were, estimated, to, have, been, contracted, from, food, a, study, by, the, australian, national, university, published, in, 2022, for, food, standards, australia, new, zealand, estimated, there, are, 4, 67, million, cases, of, food, poisoning, in, australia, each, year, that, result, in, 47, 900, hospitalisations, 38, deaths, and, a, cost, to, the, economy, of, 2, 1, billion, a, previous, study, using, different, methodology, and, published, in, november, 2014, found, in, 2010, that, there, were, an, estimated, 4, 1, million, cases, of, foodborne, gastroenteritis, acquired, in, australia, on, average, each, year, along, with, 5, 140, cases, of, non, gastrointestinal, illness, the, main, causes, were, norovirus, pathogenic, escherichia, coli, campylobacter, spp, and, non, typhoidal, salmonella, spp, although, the, causes, of, approximately, 80, of, illnesses, were, unknown, approximately, 25, 90, cri, 13, 42, of, the, 15, 9, million, episodes, of, gastroenteritis, that, occur, in, australia, were, estimated, to, be, transmitted, by, contaminated, food, this, equates, to, an, average, of, approximately, one, episode, of, foodborne, gastroenteritis, every, five, years, per, person, data, on, the, number, of, hospitalisations, and, deaths, represent, the, occurrence, of, serious, foodborne, illness, including, gastroenteritis, non, gastroenteritis, and, sequelae, there, were, an, estimated, annual, 31, 920, 90, cri, 29, 500, 35, 500, hospitalisations, due, to, foodborne, illness, and, 86, 90, cri, 70, 105, deaths, due, to, foodborne, illness, circa, 2010, this, study, concludes, that, these, rates, are, similar, to, recent, estimates, in, the, us, and, canada, a, main, aim, of, this, study, was, to, compare, if, foodborne, illness, incidence, had, increased, over, time, in, this, study, similar, methods, of, assessment, were, applied, to, data, from, circa, 2000, which, showed, that, the, rate, of, foodborne, gastroenteritis, had, not, changed, significantly, over, time, two, key, estimates, were, the, total, number, of, gastroenteritis, episodes, each, year, and, the, proportion, considered, foodborne, in, circa, 2010, it, was, estimated, that, 25, of, all, episodes, of, gastroenteritis, were, foodborne, by, applying, this, proportion, of, episodes, due, to, food, to, the, incidence, of, gastroenteritis, circa, 2000, there, were, an, estimated, 4, 3, million, 90, cri, 2, 2, 7, 3, million, episodes, of, foodborne, gastroenteritis, circa, 2000, although, credible, intervals, overlap, with, 2010, taking, into, account, changes, in, population, size, applying, these, equivalent, methods, suggests, a, 17, decrease, in, the, rate, of, foodborne, gastroenteritis, between, 2000, and, 2010, with, considerable, overlap, of, the, 90, credible, intervals, this, study, replaces, a, previous, estimate, of, 5, 4, million, cases, of, foodborne, illness, in, australia, every, year, causing, most, foodborne, disease, outbreaks, in, australia, have, been, linked, to, raw, or, minimally, cooked, eggs, or, poultry, the, australian, food, safety, information, council, estimates, that, one, third, of, cases, of, food, poisoning, occur, in, the, home, the, vast, majority, of, reported, cases, of, foodborne, illness, occur, as, individual, or, sporadic, cases, the, origin, of, most, sporadic, cases, is, undetermined, in, the, united, states, where, people, eat, outside, the, home, frequently, 58, of, cases, originate, from, commercial, food, facilities, 2004, foodnet, data, an, outbreak, is, defined, as, occurring, when, two, or, more, people, experience, similar, illness, after, consuming, food, from, a, common, source, often, a, combination, of, events, contributes, to, an, outbreak, for, example, food, might, be, left, at, room, temperature, for, many, hours, allowing, bacteria, to, multiply, which, is, compounded, by, inadequate, cooking, which, results, in, a, failure, to, kill, the, dangerously, elevated, bacterial, levels, outbreaks, are, usually, identified, when, those, affected, know, each, other, outbreaks, can, also, be, identified, by, public, health, staff, when, there, are, unexpected, increases, in, laboratory, results, for, certain, strains, of, bacteria, outbreak, detection, and, investigation, in, the, united, states, is, primarily, handled, by, local, health, jurisdictions, and, is, inconsistent, from, district, to, district, it, is, estimated, that, 1, 2, of, outbreaks, are, detected, in, aberdeen, in, 1964, a, large, scale, 400, cases, outbreak, of, typhoid, occurred, caused, by, contaminated, corned, beef, which, had, been, imported, from, argentina, the, corned, beef, was, placed, in, cans, and, because, the, cooling, plant, had, failed, cold, river, water, from, the, plate, estuary, was, used, to, cool, the, cans, one, of, the, cans, had, a, defect, and, the, meat, inside, was, contaminated, that, meat, was, then, sliced, using, a, meat, slicer, in, a, shop, in, aberdeen, and, a, lack, of, machinery, cleaning, led, to, the, spreading, of, the, contamination, to, other, meats, cut, in, the, slicer, those, meats, were, eaten, by, people, in, aberdeen, who, then, became, ill, serious, outbreaks, of, foodborne, illness, since, the, 1970s, prompted, key, changes, in, uk, food, safety, law, the, outbreaks, included, the, deaths, of, 19, patients, in, the, stanley, royd, hospital, outbreak, and, the, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, bse, mad, cow, disease, outbreak, identified, in, the, 1980s, the, deaths, of, 21, people, in, the, 1996, wishaw, outbreak, of, e, coli, o157, was, a, precursor, to, the, establishment, of, the, food, standards, agency, which, according, to, tony, blair, in, the, 1998, white, paper, a, force, for, change, cm, 3830, would, be, powerful, open, and, dedicated, to, the, interests, of, consumers, in, may, 2015, for, the, second, year, running, england, s, food, standards, agency, devoted, its, annual, food, safety, week, to, the, chicken, challenge, the, focus, was, on, the, handling, of, raw, chicken, in, the, home, and, in, catering, facilities, in, a, drive, to, reduce, the, high, levels, of, food, poisoning, from, the, campylobacter, bacterium, anne, hardy, argues, that, widespread, public, education, of, food, hygiene, can, be, useful, particularly, through, media, tv, cookery, programmes, and, advertisement, she, points, to, the, examples, set, by, scandinavian, societies, in, 2001, the, center, for, science, in, the, public, interest, petitioned, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, to, require, meat, packers, to, remove, spinal, cords, before, processing, cattle, carcasses, for, human, consumption, a, measure, designed, to, lessen, the, risk, of, infection, by, variant, creutzfeldt, jakob,
