https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_fighting_fish
the, siamese, fighting, fish, betta, splendens, commonly, known, as, the, betta, is, a, freshwater, fish, native, to, southeast, asia, namely, cambodia, laos, myanmar, malaysia, indonesia, thailand, and, vietnam, it, is, one, of, 76, species, of, the, genus, betta, but, the, only, one, eponymously, called, betta, owing, to, its, global, popularity, as, a, pet, betta, splendens, are, among, the, most, popular, aquarium, fish, in, the, world, due, to, their, diverse, and, colorful, morphology, and, relatively, low, maintenance, siamese, fighting, fish, are, endemic, to, the, central, plain, of, thailand, where, they, were, first, domesticated, at, least, 1, 000, years, ago, among, the, longest, of, any, fish, they, were, initially, bred, for, aggression, and, subject, to, gambling, matches, akin, to, cockfighting, bettas, became, known, outside, thailand, through, king, rama, iii, 1788, 1851, who, is, said, to, have, given, some, to, theodore, cantor, a, danish, physician, zoologist, and, botanist, they, first, appeared, in, the, west, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, within, decades, became, popular, as, ornamental, fish, b, splendens, long, history, of, selective, breeding, has, produced, a, wide, variety, of, coloration, and, finnage, earning, it, the, moniker, designer, fish, of, the, aquatic, world, bettas, are, well, known, for, being, highly, territorial, with, males, prone, to, attacking, each, other, if, housed, in, the, same, tank, without, a, means, of, escape, this, will, usually, result, in, the, death, of, one, or, both, fish, female, bettas, can, also, become, territorial, towards, one, another, in, confined, spaces, bettas, are, exceptionally, tolerant, of, low, oxygen, levels, and, poor, water, quality, owing, to, their, special, labyrinth, organ, a, characteristic, unique, to, the, suborder, anabantoidei, that, allows, for, the, intake, of, surface, air, in, addition, to, its, worldwide, popularity, the, siamese, fighting, fish, is, the, national, aquatic, animal, of, thailand, which, remains, the, primary, breeder, and, exporter, of, bettas, for, the, global, aquarium, market, despite, their, abundance, as, pets, b, splendens, is, listed, as, vulnerable, by, the, iucn, due, to, increasing, pollution, and, habitat, destruction, efforts, are, being, made, to, support, betta, fish, breeders, in, thailand, as, a, result, of, their, popularity, as, pets, cultural, significance, and, need, for, conservation, outside, southeast, asia, the, name, betta, is, used, specifically, to, describe, b, splendens, despite, the, term, scientifically, applying, to, the, entire, genus, which, includes, b, splendens, and, at, least, 72, other, species, betta, splendens, is, more, accurately, called, by, its, scientific, name, or, siamese, fighting, fish, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, other, members, of, the, genus, english, speakers, often, pronounce, betta, as, bay, tuh, after, the, second, letter, in, the, greek, alphabet, however, it, is, believed, the, name, is, derived, from, the, malay, word, ikan, betta, with, ikan, meaning, fish, and, bettah, referring, to, an, ancient, warrior, tribe, which, is, pronounced, bet, tah, alternative, sources, suggests, the, name, betta, splendens, is, formed, from, two, languages, consisting, of, malay, for, enduring, fish, and, the, latin, word, for, shining, another, vernacular, name, for, siamese, fighting, fish, is, plakat, often, applied, to, the, short, finned, ornamental, strains, which, is, derived, from, the, thai, word, pla, kat, thai, which, literally, means, biting, fish, this, name, is, used, in, thailand, for, all, members, of, the, betta, genus, which, share, similar, aggressive, tendencies, rather, than, for, any, specific, strain, of, the, siamese, fighting, fish, thus, the, term, fighting, fish, is, used, to, generalise, all, betta, species, besides, the, siamese, fighting, fish, siamese, fighting, fish, were, originally, given, the, scientific, name, macropodus, pugnax, in, 1849, literally, aggressive, fish, with, big, feet, likely, in, reference, to, their, elongated, pelvic, fins, in, 1897, they, were, identified, with, the, genus, betta, and, became, known, as, betta, pugnax, referring, to, their, aggressiveness, in, 1909, the, species, was, finally, renamed, betta, splendens, upon, the, discovery, that, an, existing, species, was, already, named, pugnax, b, splendens, usually, grows, to, a, length, of, about, 6, 8, cm, 2, 4, 3, 1, in, although, aquarium, specimens, are, widely, known, for, their, brilliant, colours, and, large, flowing, fins, the, natural, coloration, of, b, splendens, is, generally, green, brown, and, grey, while, the, fins, are, short, wild, fish, exhibit, strong, colours, only, when, agitated, in, captivity, siamese, fighting, fish, have, been, selectively, bred, to, display, a, vibrant, array, of, colours, and, tail, types, according, to, witte, and, schmidt, 1992, betta, splendens, is, native, to, southeast, asia, including, the, northern, malay, peninsula, central, and, eastern, thailand, kampuchea, cambodia, and, southern, vietnam, based, on, vidthayanon, 2013, a, thai, ichthyologist, and, senior, researcher, of, biodiversity, at, wwf, thailand, the, species, is, endemic, to, thailand, from, the, mae, khlong, to, chao, phraya, basins, the, eastern, slope, of, the, cardamom, mountains, cambodia, and, from, the, isthmus, of, kra, similarly, a, report, from, froese, and, pauly, 2019, identifies, betta, splendens, as, native, to, cambodia, laos, thailand, and, vietnam, they, are, also, found, throughout, the, neighbouring, malay, peninsula, and, in, adjacent, parts, of, sumatra, likely, due, to, human, introduction, wherever, they, are, found, betta, splendens, generally, inhabit, shallow, bodies, of, water, with, abundant, vegetation, including, marshes, floodplains, and, paddy, fields, the, historic, prevalence, of, rice, farming, across, southeast, asia, which, provided, an, ideal, habitat, for, bettas, led, to, their, discovery, and, subsequent, domestication, by, humans, the, combination, of, shallow, water, and, high, air, temperature, causes, gases, to, rapidly, evaporate, leading, to, a, significant, deficit, of, oxygen, in, the, betta, s, natural, habitat, this, environment, likely, led, to, the, evolution, of, the, lung, like, labyrinth, organ, which, allows, siamese, fighting, fish, like, all, members, of, the, suborder, anabantoidei, to, breathe, directly, from, the, air, subsequently, bettas, can, live, and, even, thrive, in, harsher, environments, than, other, freshwater, fish, which, in, turn, leaves, them, with, fewer, natural, predators, and, competitors, in, the, wild, bettas, thrive, at, a, fairly, low, population, density, of, 1, 7, individuals, per, square, meter, the, tropical, climate, of, the, betta, s, natural, habitat, is, characterized, by, sudden, and, extreme, fluctuations, in, water, availability, chemistry, and, temperature, water, ph, can, range, from, slightly, acidic, ph, 6, 9, to, highly, alkaline, ph, 8, 2, while, air, temperatures, drop, as, low, as, 15, c, 59, f, and, rise, as, high, as, 40, c, 100, f, consequently, siamese, fighting, fish, are, highly, adaptable, and, durable, able, to, tolerate, a, variety, of, harsh, or, toxic, environments, this, accounts, for, their, popularity, as, pets, as, well, as, their, ability, to, successfully, colonize, bodies, of, water, all, over, the, world, wild, bettas, prefer, to, live, in, bodies, of, water, teeming, with, aquatic, vegetation, and, surface, foliage, such, as, fallen, leaves, and, water, lilies, the, abundance, of, plants, provides, security, from, predators, and, a, buffer, between, aggressive, males, who, coexist, by, claiming, dense, sections, of, plants, as, territory, such, vegetation, also, offers, protection, to, females, during, spawning, and, to, fry, during, their, earliest, and, most, vulnerable, stages, the, betta, s, worldwide, popularity, has, led, to, its, release, and, home, in, similarly, tropical, areas, including, southeast, australia, brazil, colombia, the, dominican, republic, southeast, united, states, and, singapore, in, january, 2014, a, large, population, of, bettas, was, discovered, in, the, adelaide, river, floodplain, in, the, northern, territory, australia, as, an, invasive, species, they, pose, a, threat, to, native, fish, frogs, and, other, wetland, wildlife, bettas, have, also, become, established, in, subtropical, areas, of, the, united, states, namely, southern, texas, and, florida, although, an, assessment, by, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, determined, they, were, no, threat, to, natural, ecosystems, due, to, their, popularity, siamese, fighting, fish, are, highly, abundant, in, captivity, in, the, wild, betta, habitats, are, threatened, by, chemical, and, agricultural, run, off, in, addition, to, the, contamination, of, human, medication, residue, into, aquatic, ecosystems, from, the, sewage, system, such, contamination, can, also, alter, the, reproductive, behavior, of, the, species, by, decreasing, hatch, rate, and, increasing, the, likelihood, of, fathers, eating, their, own, eggs, due, to, the, expansion, of, palm, oil, plantation, in, southeast, asia, wild, bettas, are, also, facing, habitat, loss, the, primary, threats, are, habitat, destruction, and, pollution, caused, by, urban, and, agricultural, development, across, central, thailand, wild, specimens, are, categorized, by, the, iucn, as, vulnerable, indicating, the, species, is, likely, to, become, endangered, without, conservation, efforts, betta, splendens, is, naturally, carnivorous, feeding, on, zooplankton, small, crustaceans, and, the, larvae, of, aquatic, insects, such, as, mosquitoes, as, well, as, insects, that, have, fallen, into, the, water, and, algae, contrary, to, some, marketing, materials, in, the, pet, trade, bettas, cannot, subsist, solely, on, vegetation, or, the, roots, of, plants, bettas, can, be, fed, a, varied, diet, of, pellets, flakes, or, frozen, foods, like, brine, shrimp, bloodworms, daphnia, and, many, others, due, to, their, short, digestive, tracts, a, characteristic, of, most, carnivores, bettas, have, difficulty, processing, carbohydrates, such, as, corn, and, wheat, which, are, commonly, used, as, fillers, in, many, commercial, fish, foods, thus, regardless, of, the, source, a, proper, betta, diet, should, consist, mostly, of, animal, protein, bettas, are, susceptible, to, overfeeding, which, can, lead, to, obesity, constipation, swim, bladder, disease, and, other, health, problems, excessive, food, may, also, pollute, the, water, it, is, generally, advised, to, feed, a, betta, at, least, once, daily, with, only, the, amount, of, food, it, can, eat, within, 3, 5, minutes, leftover, food, should, be, removed, if, interested, in, a, female, male, bettas, will, flare, their, gills, spread, their, fins, and, twist, their, bodies, in, a, dance, like, performance, receptive, females, will, respond, by, darkening, in, color, and, developing, vertical, lines, known, as, breeding, bars, males, build, bubble, nests, of, various, sizes, and, thicknesses, at, the, surface, of, the, water, which, interested, females, may, examine, most, do, this, regularly, even, if, there, is, no, female, present, plants, or, rocks, that, break, the, surface, often, form, a, base, for, bubble, nests, during, courtship, the, male, betta, may, exhibit, aggressive, behavior, towards, the, female, by, acts, of, chasing, or, nipping, at, her, fins, the, act, of, spawning, itself, is, called, a, nuptial, embrace, for, the, male, wraps, his, body, around, the, female, around, 10, 40, eggs, are, released, during, each, embrace, until, the, female, is, exhausted, of, eggs, with, each, deposit, of, eggs, the, male, releases, milt, into, the, water, and, fertilisation, takes, place, externally, during, and, after, spawning, the, male, uses, his, mouth, to, retrieve, sinking, eggs, and, place, them, in, the, bubble, nest, during, mating, some, females, assist, their, partner, but, more, often, will, simply, devour, all, the, eggs, she, manages, to, catch, once, the, female, has, released, all, of, her, eggs, she, is, chased, away, from, the, male, s, territory, as, she, will, likely, eat, the, eggs, if, she, is, not, removed, from, the, tank, she, will, most, likely, be, killed, by, the, male, the, eggs, remain, in, the, male, s, care, he, carefully, keeps, them, in, his, bubble, nest, making, sure, none, fall, to, the, bottom, repairing, the, bubble, nest, as, needed, incubation, lasts, for, 24, 36, hours, newly, hatched, larvae, remain, in, the, nest, for, the, next, two, to, three, days, until, their, yolk, sacs, are, fully, absorbed, afterwards, the, fry, leave, the, nest, and, the, free, swimming, stage, begins, in, this, first, period, of, their, lives, b, splendens, fry, are, totally, dependent, on, their, gills, the, labyrinth, organ, which, allows, the, species, to, breathe, atmospheric, oxygen, typically, develops, at, three, to, six, weeks, of, age, depending, on, the, general, growth, rate, which, can, be, highly, variable, b, splendens, can, reach, sexual, maturity, in, as, early, as, 4, 5, months, typically, the, morphological, differences, between, males, and, females, can, be, noticed, around, two, months, after, hatching, during, development, betta, fry, can, be, fed, either, commercial, artificial, feeds, or, live, moving, prey, which, tends, to, be, favored, more, examples, of, live, feed, for, betta, fry, include, baby, brine, shrimp, water, fleas, and, mosquito, larvae, although, common, fed, to, fish, fry, boiled, egg, yolks, are, not, preferred, by, the, fish, information, on, precisely, how, and, when, siamese, fighting, fish, were, first, domesticated, and, brought, out, of, asia, is, sparse, genetic, analysis, implies, domestication, at, least, 1, 000, years, ago, additional, evidence, from, dna, sampling, suggests, bettas, may, have, been, bred, for, fighting, since, the, 13th, century, over, time, this, led, to, the, diverse, genetics, of, modern, domestic, and, wild, bettas, some, people, in, malaysia, and, thailand, are, known, to, have, collected, wild, bettas, at, least, by, the, 19th, century, observing, their, aggressive, nature, and, pitting, them, against, each, other, in, gambling, matches, akin, to, cockfights, in, the, wild, betta, spar, for, only, a, few, minutes, before, one, fish, retreats, domesticated, betta, namely, plakat, bettas, are, bred, specifically, for, heightened, aggression, and, can, engage, for, much, longer, with, winners, determined, by, a, willingness, to, continue, fighting, once, a, fish, retreats, the, match, is, over, fights, to, the, death, were, rare, so, bets, were, placed, on, the, bravery, of, the, fish, rather, than, its, survival, due, to, the, difference, in, genetics, from, domesticated, bettas, being, originally, bred, for, fighting, captive, ornamental, species, tends, to, be, more, aggressive, than, wild, betta, species, the, popularity, of, these, fights, garnered, the, attention, of, king, of, siam, thailand, who, regulated, and, taxed, the, matches, and, collected, fighting, fish, of, his, own, in, 1840, he, gave, some, of, his, prized, fish, to, danish, physician, theodore, edward, cantor, who, worked, in, the, bengal, medical, service, nine, years, later, cantor, published, the, first, recorded, article, describing, these, fish, giving, them, the, name, macropodus, pugnax, in, 1909, british, ichthyologist, charles, tate, regan, found, there, was, a, related, species, already, named, macropodus, pugnax, and, thus, renamed, the, domesticated, siamese, fighting, fish, betta, splendens, or, splendid, fighter, betta, splendens, first, entered, the, western, aquarium, trade, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, earliest, known, arrival, is, 1874, in, france, when, french, aquaria, expert, and, ichthyologist, pierre, carbonnier, began, importing, and, breeding, several, specimens, in, 1896, german, tropical, fish, expert, paul, matte, brought, the, first, specimens, into, germany, from, moscow, most, likely, from, the, strain, developed, by, carbonnier, this, indicates, bettas, were, already, somewhat, established, in, france, and, russia, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, fighting, fish, were, also, present, in, australia, by, 1904, based, on, an, article, written, by, british, born, zoologist, edgar, ravenswood, waite, and, published, by, the, australian, museum, in, sydney, waite, indicates, that, australian, specimens, were, brought, from, penang, malaysia, near, the, border, with, thailand, he, also, makes, reference, to, two, articles, about, fighting, fish, published, by, carbonnier, in, 1874, and, 1881, bettas, may, have, first, entered, the, united, states, in, 1910, via, importers, in, california, there, is, also, evidence, they, were, imported, in, 1927, from, cambodia, while, it, is, unclear, when, bettas, became, popular, in, the, aquarium, trade, the, early, 20th, century, marked, the, first, known, departure, from, centuries, of, breeding, bettas, for, aggression, to, instead, selecting, for, colour, finnage, and, overall, beauty, for, ornamental, purposes, in, 1927, an, article, was, published, in, germany, describing, the, long, flowing, fins, of, the, veiltail, breed, which, indicates, an, emphasis, on, aesthetic, beauty, in, the, 1950s, an, american, breeder, created, a, larger, and, longer, finned, veiltail, while, around, 1960, indian, breeders, discovered, a, genetic, mutation, that, allowed, for, two, caudal, fins, producing, the, doubletail, variety, within, that, decade, a, german, breeder, created, the, deltatail, characterised, by, its, broader, triangular, fins, in, 1967, a, group, of, betta, breeders, formed, the, international, betta, congress, ibc, the, first, formal, interest, group, dedicated, to, siamese, fighting, fish, the, ibc, aimed, to, breed, varieties, that, would, be, healthier, and, more, symmetrical, in, fins, and, body, shape, with, an, emphasis, on, animal, welfare, as, tropical, fish, bettas, prefer, a, water, temperature, of, around, 75, 82, f, 24, 28, c, but, have, been, observed, surviving, temporarily, at, extremes, of, 56, f, 13, c, to, 95, f, 35, c, when, kept, in, colder, climates, aquarium, heaters, are, recommended, as, colder, water, weakens, their, immune, system, and, makes, them, susceptible, to, certain, diseases, bettas, are, also, affected, by, the, ph, of, the, water, a, neutral, ph, of, 7, 0, is, ideal, but, slightly, higher, levels, are, tolerable, due, to, their, labyrinth, organ, bettas, can, endure, low, oxygen, levels, but, cannot, survive, for, long, in, unmaintained, aquaria, as, poor, water, quality, makes, all, tropical, fish, more, susceptible, to, diseases, like, fin, rot, or, scale, loss, thus, notwithstanding, the, betta, s, well, known, tolerance, of, still, water, a, mechanical, filter, is, considered, necessary, for, their, long, term, health, and, longevity, similarly, live, aquatic, plants, provide, a, supplemental, source, of, filtration, in, addition, to, crucial, enrichment, to, the, betta, despite, frequently, being, displayed, and, sold, in, small, containers, in, the, pet, trade, bettas, do, best, in, larger, environments, while, they, can, survive, in, cups, bowls, and, other, confined, spaces, they, will, be, much, happier, healthier, and, longer, lived, in, a, larger, aquarium, although, some, betta, enthusiasts, claim, there, is, a, minimum, tank, size, determining, a, strict, baseline, is, somewhat, arbitrary, and, subject, to, debate, but, most, people, consider, a, 5, gallons, tank, as, the, minimum, although, male, bettas, are, solitary, and, aggressive, towards, one, another, they, can, generally, cohabit, with, many, types, of, fish, and, invertebrates, if, there, is, adequate, space, and, hiding, places, however, compatibility, varies, based, on, the, temperament, of, the, individual, betta, and, it, is, advised, to, carefully, supervise, the, betta, s, interaction, with, other, fish, tankmates, must, be, tropical, communal, nonterritorial, and, not, have, a, similar, body, type, or, long, flowing, fins, coldwater, fish, like, goldfish, have, incompatible, temperature, requirements, while, aggressive, and, predatory, fish, are, likely, to, nip, at, the, betta, s, fins, or, erode, their, slime, coat, species, that, shoal, such, as, tetras, and, danios, are, considered, most, ideal, since, they, usually, keep, to, themselves, and, can, endure, the, territorial, nature, of, bettas, with, their, numbers, brightly, coloured, fish, with, large, fins, such, as, male, guppies, should, be, avoided, as, they, may, invite, fin, nipping, by, the, male, betta, potential, tankmates, should, usually, be, added, before, the, male, betta, so, they, can, establish, their, respective, territories, beforehand, rather, than, compete, with, the, betta, female, bettas, are, less, aggressive, and, territorial, than, males, and, thus, can, live, with, a, greater, variety, of, fish, for, example, brightly, coloured, or, large, finned, fish, will, not, usually, disturb, a, female, generally, female, fighting, fish, can, also, tolerate, larger, or, more, numerous, tankmates, than, males, however, like, male, bettas, a, female, s, tolerance, of, other, fish, will, vary, by, individual, temperament, it, is, not, recommended, to, keep, male, and, female, bettas, together, except, temporarily, for, breeding, purposes, which, should, always, be, undertaken, with, caution, and, supervision, bettas, are, fairly, intelligent, and, inquisitive, and, thus, require, stimulation, otherwise, they, can, become, bored, and, depressed, leading, to, lethargy, and, a, weaker, immune, system, decorations, such, as, silk, or, live, plants, rocks, caves, driftwood, and, other, ornaments, provide, crucial, enrichment, provided, they, do, not, have, rough, textures, or, jagged, edges, which, can, damage, their, delicate, fins, in, the, wild, siamese, fighting, fish, spend, most, of, their, time, concealing, themselves, under, floating, debris, or, overhanging, plants, to, avoid, potential, predators, floating, plants, and, leaves, can, help, bettas, feel, more, secure, while, also, giving, males, an, anchor, from, which, to, build, their, bubble, nests, abundant, vegetation, of, any, kind, is, generally, recommended, to, provide, maximum, security, and, to, cater, to, the, betta, s, instinct, to, claim, protective, territory, indian, almond, leaves, are, increasingly, popular, for, providing, something, closer, to, the, natural, foliage, under, which, bettas, would, hide, in, the, wild, their, tannins, allegedly, confer, several, health, benefits, including, treating, certain, ailments, like, fin, rot, and, bladder, disease, and, stabilising, the, ph, of, the, water, when, properly, kept, and, fed, a, correct, diet, siamese, fighting, fish, generally, live, between, three, and, five, years, in, captivity, though, in, rare, cases, may, live, as, long, as, seven, to, ten, years, one, study, found, that, bettas, kept, in, tanks, of, several, gallons, and, provided, with, proper, nutrition, and, exercise, in, the, form, of, being, chased, around, by, a, stick, for, a, short, period, lived, over, nine, years, by, contrast, a, control, group, of, bettas, confined, to, small, jars, lived, far, fewer, years, a, larger, tank, with, proper, filtration, regular, maintenance, and, an, abundance, of, decor, and, hiding, spaces, along, with, a, rich, protein, based, diet, increases, the, likelihood, of, a, long, lifespan, like, all, tropical, fish, in, captivity, bettas, are, susceptible, to, several, kinds, of, diseases, usually, caused, by, bacterial, fungal, or, parasitic, infections, most, illnesses, result, from, poor, water, quality, and, cold, water, both, of, which, weaken, the, immune, system, the, four, most, common, illnesses, are, white, spot, velvet, fin, rot, and, dropsy, with, the, exception, of, the, latter, which, is, incurable, these, ailments, can, be, treated, with, a, combination, of, over, the, counter, fish, medication, increased, water, temperature, and, or, regular, water, changes, over, a, century, of, intensive, selective, breeding, has, produced, a, wide, variety, of, colours, and, fin, types, and, breeders, around, the, world, continue, to, develop, new, varieties, often, the, males, of, the, species, are, sold, preferentially, in, stores, because, of, their, beauty, relative, to, the, females, which, almost, never, develop, fins, or, vibrant, colours, as, showy, as, their, male, counterparts, however, some, breeders, have, produced, females, with, fairly, long, fins, and, bright, colours, betta, splendens, can, be, hybridised, with, b, imbellis, b, mahachaiensis, and, b, smaragdina, though, with, the, latter, the, fry, tend, to, have, low, survival, rates, in, addition, to, these, hybrids, within, the, genus, betta, intergeneric, hybridisation, of, betta, splendens, and, macropodus, opercularis, the, paradise, fish, has, been, reported, wild, bettas, exhibit, strong, colours, only, when, agitated, over, the, centuries, breeders, have, been, able, to, make, this, coloration, permanent, and, a, wide, variety, of, hues, breed, true, colours, among, captive, bettas, include, red, orange, yellow, blue, steel, blue, turquoise, green, black, pastel, opaque, white, and, multi, coloured, recent, evidence, suggest, blue, colored, males, may, show, higher, levels, of, aggression, than, red, colored, males, on, the, other, hand, female, bettas, may, have, a, preference, for, red, colored, mates, as, opposed, to, their, blue, counterparts, the, betta, s, diverse, colours, are, due, to, different, layers, of, pigmentation, in, their, skin, the, layers, from, deepest, within, to, the, outermost, consists, of, red, yellow, black, iridescent, blue, and, green, and, metallic, not, a, colour, itself, but, reacts, with, the, other, colours, any, combination, of, these, layers, can, be, present, leading, to, a, wide, variety, of, colours, within, and, among, bettas, the, shades, of, blue, turquoise, and, green, are, slightly, iridescent, and, can, appear, to, change, colour, with, different, lighting, conditions, or, viewing, angles, this, is, because, these, colours, unlike, black, or, red, are, not, due, to, pigments, but, created, through, refraction, within, a, layer, of, translucent, guanine, crystals, breeders, have, also, developed, different, colour, patterns, such, as, marble, and, butterfly, as, well, as, metallic, shades, like, copper, gold, or, platinum, which, were, obtained, by, crossing, b, splendens, to, other, betta, species, some, bettas, will, change, colours, throughout, their, lifetime, a, process, known, as, marbling, which, is, attributed, to, a, transposon, in, which, a, dna, sequence, can, change, its, position, within, a, genome, thereby, altering, a, cell, koi, bettas, have, mutated, over, time, and, in, some, case, change, colours, or, patterns, throughout, their, lifetime, known, as, true, koi, due, to, the, defective, gene, that, causes, marbling, not, being, repaired, in, the, color, layers, after, some, time, common, colours, rarer, colours, colour, patterns, breeders, have, developed, several, different, finnage, and, scale, variations, siamese, fighting, fish, display, complex, behavioural, patterns, and, social, interactions, which, vary, among, individual, specimens, research, indicates, they, are, capable, of, associative, learning, in, which, they, adopt, a, consistent, response, following, exposure, to, new, stimuli, these, characteristics, have, made, bettas, subject, to, intensive, study, by, ethologists, neurologists, and, comparative, psychologists, males, and, females, flare, or, puff, out, their, gill, covers, opercula, to, appear, more, impressive, either, to, intimidate, other, rivals, or, as, an, act, of, courtship, flaring, also, occurs, when, they, are, intimidated, by, movement, or, a, change, of, scene, in, their, environments, in, captivity, bettas, can, be, seen, flaring, at, their, own, reflection, because, they, don, t, pass, the, mirror, test, for, self, recognition, both, sexes, display, pale, horizontal, bars, if, stressed, or, frightened, however, such, colour, changes, common, in, females, of, any, age, are, rare, in, mature, males, due, to, their, intensity, of, colour, females, often, flare, at, other, females, especially, when, setting, up, a, pecking, order, flirting, fish, behave, similarly, with, vertical, instead, of, horizontal, stripes, indicating, a, willingness, and, readiness, to, breed, betta, splendens, enjoy, a, decorated, tank, as, they, seek, to, establish, territory, even, when, housed, alone, they, may, set, up, a, territory, centered, on, a, plant, or, rocky, alcove, sometimes, becoming, highly, possessive, of, it, and, aggressive, toward, trespassing, rivals, consequently, bettas, if, housed, with, other, fish, require, at, least, 45, litres, about, 10, gallons, contrary, to, popular, belief, bettas, are, compatible, with, many, other, species, of, aquarium, fish, given, the, proper, parameters, bettas, will, only, be, aggressive, towards, smaller, and, slower, fish, than, themselves, such, as, guppies, betta, aggression, has, historically, made, them, objects, of, gambling, two, male, fish, are, pitted, against, each, other, to, fight, with, bets, placed, on, which, one, will, win, combat, is, characterised, by, fin, nipping, flared, gills, extended, fins, and, intensified, colour, the, fight, continues, until, one, participant, is, submissive, or, tries, to, retreat, one, or, both, fish, may, die, depending, on, the, seriousness, of, their, injuries, though, bettas, rarely, intend, to, fight, to, the, death, to, avoid, fights, over, territory, male, siamese, fighting, fish, are, best, isolated, from, one, another, males, will, occasionally, respond, aggressively, even, to, their, own, reflections, though, this, is, obviously, safer, than, exposing, the, fish, to, another, male, prolonged, sight, of, their, reflection, may, lead, to, stress, in, some, individuals, not, all, siamese, fighting, fish, respond, negatively, to, other, males, especially, if, the, tank, is, large, enough, for, each, fish, to, create, their, own, designated, territory, in, general, studies, have, shown, that, females, exhibit, similar, aggressive, behaviours, to, males, albeit, less, frequently, and, intensely, an, observational, study, examined, a, group, of, female, siamese, fighting, fish, over, a, period, of, two, weeks, during, which, time, they, were, recorded, attacking, flaring, and, biting, food, this, indicated, that, when, females, are, housed, in, small, groups, they, form, a, stable, dominance, order, or, pecking, order, for, example, the, fish, ranked, at, the, top, showed, higher, levels, of, mutual, displays, in, comparison, to, the, fish, who, were, of, lower, ranks, the, researchers, also, found, that, the, duration, of, the, displays, differed, depending, on, whether, an, attack, occurred, the, results, of, this, research, suggest, that, female, siamese, fighting, fish, warrant, as, much, scientific, study, as, males, as, they, seem, to, have, variations, in, their, behaviours, as, well, there, has, been, much, research, in, the, courtship, behaviour, between, male, and, female, siamese, fighting, fish, studies, generally, focus, on, the, aggressive, behaviours, of, males, during, the, courtship, process, for, example, one, study, found, that, when, male, fish, are, in, the, bubble, nest, phase, their, aggression, toward, females, is, quite, low, this, is, due, to, the, males, attempting, to, attract, potential, mates, to, their, nest, so, eggs, can, successfully, be, laid, it, has, also, been, found, that, in, determining, a, suitable, mate, females, often, eavesdrop, on, pairs, of, males, that, are, fighting, when, a, female, witnesses, aggressive, behaviour, between, males, she, is, more, likely, to, be, attracted, to, the, male, who, won, in, contrast, if, a, female, did, not, eavesdrop, on, a, fight, between, males, she, will, show, no, preference, in, mate, choice, in, regards, to, the, males, the, loser, is, more, likely, to, attempt, to, court, the, fish, who, did, not, eavesdrop, while, the, winner, showed, no, preference, between, females, who, eavesdropped, and, those, who, did, not, one, study, considered, the, ways, in, which, male, siamese, fighting, fish, alter, their, behaviours, during, courtship, when, another, male, is, present, during, this, experiment, a, dummy, female, was, placed, in, the, tank, the, researchers, expected, that, males, would, conceal, their, courtship, from, intruders, instead, when, another, male, fish, was, present, the, male, was, more, likely, to, engage, in, courtship, behaviours, with, the, dummy, female, fish, when, no, barriers, were, present, the, males, were, more, likely, to, engage, in, gill, flaring, at, an, intruder, male, fish, the, researchers, concluded, that, the, male, was, attempting, to, court, the, female, and, communicate, with, its, rival, at, the, same, time, these, results, indicate, the, importance, of, considering, courtship, behaviour, as, the, literature, has, suggested, there, are, many, factors, that, can, dramatically, affect, the, ways, in, which, both, male, and, females, can, act, in, courtship, settings, studies, have, found, that, siamese, fighting, fish, often, begin, with, behaviours, that, require, high, cost, and, gradually, decrease, their, behaviours, as, the, encounter, proceeds, this, indicates, that, siamese, fighting, fish, will, first, begin, an, encounter, using, much, metabolic, energy, but, will, gradually, decrease, as, to, not, use, too, much, energy, thus, making, the, encounter, a, waste, if, the, fish, is, not, successful, similarly, researchers, have, found, that, when, pairs, of, male, siamese, fighting, fish, were, kept, together, in, the, same, tank, for, a, three, day, period, aggressive, behaviour, was, most, prevalent, during, the, mornings, of, the, first, two, days, of, their, cohabitation, however, the, researchers, observed, that, the, fighting, between, the, two, males, decreased, as, the, day, progressed, the, male, in, the, dominant, position, initially, had, metabolic, advantage, although, as, the, experiment, progressed, both, fish, became, equal, in, regards, to, metabolic, advantages, in, regards, to, oxygen, consumption, one, study, found, that, when, two, male, bettas, fought, the, metabolic, rates, of, both, fish, did, not, differ, before, or, during, the, fight, however, the, fish, who, won, showed, higher, oxygen, consumption, during, the, evening, following, the, fight, this, indicates, that, aggressive, behaviour, in, the, form, of, fighting, has, long, lasting, effects, on, metabolism, siamese, fighting, fish, are, popular, models, for, studying, the, neurological, and, physiological, impact, of, certain, chemicals, such, as, hormones, since, their, aggression, is, the, result, of, cell, signalling, and, possibly, genes, one, study, investigated, the, effect, of, testosterone, on, female, siamese, fighting, fish, females, were, given, testosterone, which, resulted, in, changes, to, fin, length, body, coloration, and, gonads, that, resembled, typical, male, fish, their, aggressive, behaviour, was, found, to, be, elevated, when, interacting, with, other, females, but, reduced, when, interacting, with, males, the, researchers, then, allowed, the, females, to, interact, with, a, control, group, of, unaltered, females, when, the, female, fish, stopped, receiving, testosterone, those, who, were, exposed, to, the, normal, females, still, exhibited, male, typical, behaviours, in, contrast, the, female, fish, who, were, kept, isolated, did, not, continue, to, exhibit, the, male, typical, behaviours, after, testosterone, was, discontinued, another, study, exposed, male, siamese, fighting, fish, to, endocrine, disrupting, chemicals, the, researchers, were, curious, if, exposure, to, these, chemicals, would, affect, the, ways, in, which, females, respond, to, the, exposed, males, it, was, found, that, when, shown, videos, of, the, exposed, males, the, females, favoured, those, who, were, not, exposed, to, the, endocrine, disrupting, chemicals, and, avoided, those, males, that, were, exposed, the, researchers, concluded, that, exposure, to, these, chemicals, can, negatively, affect, the, mating, success, of, male, siamese, fighting, fish, a, psychology, study, used, male, siamese, fighting, fish, to, investigate, the, effects, of, fluoxetine, an, ssri, used, primarily, as, an, antidepressant, in, humans, siamese, fighting, fish, were, selected, as, prime, models, due, to, having, comparable, serotonin, transporter, pathways, which, accounts, for, their, aggression, it, was, found, that, when, exposed, to, fluoxetine, male, siamese, fighting, fish, exhibited, less, aggressive, behaviour, than, is, characteristic, of, their, species, similarly, research, has, found, that, bettas, are, responsive, to, serotonin, dopamine, and, gaba, betta, fish, can, exhibit, unusual, sleep, behaviors, often, resulting, in, new, betta, owners, assuming, that, their, betta, fish, has, died, in, an, aquarium, betta, fish, sleep, anywhere, in, the, tank, they, feel, comfortable, including, at, the, bottom, on, the, substrate, floating, at, the, mid, level, or, at, the, surface, betta, fish, will, sleep, on, their, side, upside, down, with, their, nose, pointing, up, or, with, their, tail, pointing, up, they, are, also, known, to, curl, up, or, wedge, between, tight, spaces, such, as, behind, a, heater, one, of, the, more, unusual, sleep, behaviors, that, betta, fish, exhibit, is, their, ability, to, sleep, out, of, the, water, resting, on, a, leaf, or, any, other, flat, object, protruding, from, the, water, this, is, made, possible, by, the, betta, s, labyrinth, organ, which, acts, like, a, human, lung, pulling, oxygen, from, the, air, instead, of, from, the, water, when, betta, fish, sleep, their, bright, colors, will, often, fade, and, when, combined, with, their, unusual, napping, positions, they, can, appear, dead, predatory, fish, will, often, avoid, eating, a, dead, fish, because, of, the, risk, of, contracting, diseases, and, parasites, making, this, an, excellent, defensive, mechanism, despite, its, commercial, popularity, little, is, known, about, the, betta, splendens, genome, current, understanding, is, so, limited, that, there, is, little, evidence, for, the, genetic, basis, of, basic, traits, including, sex, determination, a, 2021, review, article, argued, for, increased, scientific, investigation, into, the, genome, of, the, siamese, fighting, fish, and, listed, several, areas, of, interest, which, are, paraphrased, below, additionally, betta, fish, have, been, used, in, several, studies, to, assess, the, impacts, of, various, environmental, contaminants, including, oil, improved, understanding, of, the, betta, genome, would, allow, for, more, accurate, generalisations, from, these, studies, lastly, the, betta, fish, is, an, excellent, candidate, for, a, model, organism, particularly, for, aggression, and, pigmentation, development, due, to, their, extreme, phenotypes, in, these, areas, currently, the, complete, b, splendens, chromosomal, and, mitochondrial, genomes, have, been, sequenced, both, genomes, have, yet, to, be, annotated, though, a, roadmap, for, future, efforts, has, been, outlined, notably, the, mitochondrial, genome, for, the, peaceful, betta, p, imbellis, has, also, been, sequenced, potentially, allowing, for, meaningful, comparison, between, species, in, the, future, there, are, many, species, in, the, genus, betta, the, majority, of, which, are, very, morphologically, similar, within, thailand, alone, there, are, twelve, nominal, species, with, new, species, being, discovered, every, 5, 10, years, past, efforts, to, differentiate, betta, species, have, been, based, on, observable, morphology, but, given, their, visible, similarity, this, approach, has, masked, much, of, the, cryptic, diversity, in, the, genus, recent, speciation, efforts, have, included, use, of, dna, barcoding, to, differentiate, species, specifically, comparing, the, co1, gene, of, the, mitochondrial, genome, resulting, in, new, theories, about, the, relatedness, between, species, and, allowing, for, the, construction, of, new, phylogenetic, trees, the, morphological, similarity, between, species, that, can, be, distinguished, genetically, suggests, that, species, radiation, with, cryptic, diversity, occurred, in, the, betta, lineage, current, theories, about, the, species, radiation, and, speciation, take, into, account, the, geographic, considerations, of, their, native, habitat, of, thailand, and, suggest, that, the, speciation, is, best, described, by, a, model, of, either, allopatric, or, parapatric, speciation, b, splendens, are, known, for, their, intense, aggression, which, has, resulted, from, intense, selective, pressures, imposed, upon, them, from, many, generations, of, artificial, selection, fighting, strains, of, b, splendens, have, been, bred, for, aggression, for, over, six, centuries, due, to, the, culture, surrounding, fighting, betta, fish, and, betting, money, on, the, results, this, has, genetically, differentiated, them, from, their, wild, type, counterparts, fighting, strains, of, b, splendens, have, been, shown, to, be, significantly, more, aggressive, than, wild, bettas, and, in, addition, show, differential, responses, in, cortisol, production, in, new, environments, the, extreme, genetically, driven, aggression, in, fighting, strains, of, b, splendens, and, their, differences, from, the, still, observable, wild, type, makes, them, an, excellent, candidate, for, a, model, organism, through, which, to, study, the, genetic, basis, for, aggression, at, present, use, of, the, betta, fish, as, a, model, organism, for, studying, aggression, is, in, its, beginning, phases, little, is, known, about, the, genetic, basis, of, aggression, in, betas, though, differential, degrees, of, aggression, have, been, observed, in, different, domesticated, betta, populations, there, is, evidence, that, the, genetic, basis, for, aggression, in, betta, fish, is, not, exclusively, sex, linked, a, 2019, study, found, that, female, bettas, of, the, fighting, strain, show, significantly, higher, levels, of, aggression, than, their, female, wild, type, counterparts, despite, the, fact, that, historically, only, male, bettas, have, been, used, in, fights, and, thus, artificially, selected, for, aggression, however, these, results, are, of, limited, usefulness, given, the, lack, of, scientific, consensus, on, the, nature, of, sex, determination, in, bettas, a, recent, study, found, that, a, fighting, pair, of, bettas, will, synchronise, their, gene, expression, profiles, with, particular, emphasis, on, 37, co, expression, gene, modules, some, of, which, were, only, synchronised, after, a, certain, duration, of, time, had, been, spent, fighting, work, to, identify, the, genetic, basis, for, aggression, has, also, been, performed, more, generally, in, other, model, species, such, as, zebrafish, these, studies, have, identified, dozens, of, candidate, genes, in, their, respective, model, organisms, which, could, serve, as, starting, points, for, research, into, aggression, in, betta, fish, however, more, progress, must, be, made, on, the, annotation, of, the, betta, genome, before, this, is, feasible, due, to, the, incredible, variation, in, pigmentation, of, adult, bettas, and, visible, pigment, in, developing, embryos, bettas, are, an, attractive, model, organism, for, studying, the, genetic, basis, for, coloration, additionally, producing, a, specific, color, on, demand, would, be, of, great, interest, to, the, commercial, betta, fish, industry, as, the, price, of, a, fish, is, largely, determined, by, its, coloration, prices, for, attractively, coloured, fish, can, be, high, single, fish, with, the, colours, of, the, thai, flag, was, sold, for, over, 1, 500, the, genetic, basis, for, the, synthesis, and, regulation, of, pigmentation, in, teleost, fish, is, generally, poorly, understood, and, bettas, are, no, exception, most, work, in, this, area, has, been, done, on, other, model, organisms, such, as, zebrafish, or, african, cichlid, fish, however, as, with, aggression, work, done, with, other, model, organisms, to, identify, candidate, genes, will, be, tremendously, helpful, in, identifying, the, genetic, basis, of, pigmentation, in, bettas, in, 1990, genetic, differences, polymorphisms, at, several, loci, were, found, between, four, different, color, varieties, of, bettas, though, the, variations, were, noted, to, be, small, later, experiments, confirmed, the, presence, of, genetic, variation, in, hatchery, stocks, in, thailand, with, low, average, numbers, of, alleles, per, locus, and, high, heterozygosity, rates, notable, color, phenotypes, in, b, splendens, include, the, marbled, phenotype, and, the, color, changing, phenotype, the, latter, of, which, changes, color, over, the, course, of, its, lifetime, while, theories, for, the, genetic, basis, of, these, phenotypes, exist, scientific, evidence, for, the, genetic, basis, of, these, phenomena, are, slim, to, nonexistent, some, of, the, few, candidate, genes, identified, in, the, literature, specific, to, bettas, are, immune, related, genes, which, were, found, in, the, first, whole, body, transcriptome, of, b, splendens, obtained, by, high, throughput, sequencing, today, southeast, asia, dominates, the, industry, of, breeding, and, distribution, of, siamese, fighting, fish, globally, initially, male, and, female, fry, are, raised, together, in, communal, tanks, up, until, males, begin, to, display, aggression, at, about, 4, 5, months, of, age, males, are, then, kept, isolated, in, a, half, pint, liquor, flask, where, hundreds, of, these, pints, may, be, arranged, tightly, packed, on, the, ground, in, the, breeding, facility, daily, feeding, of, usually, bloodworms, are, dispensed, into, each, flask, at, the, shoulder, of, each, flask, there, is, typically, a, cut, to, allow, water, to, flow, out, for, an, easy, water, change, meanwhile, females, may, be, kept, in, communal, tanks, until, shipping, day, roughly, 100, 000, male, bettas, are, shipped, each, week, from, thailand, to, countries, around, the, world, according, to, dr, amonrat, sermwatanakul, head, of, senior, fisheries, experts, of, the, department, of, fisheries, bangkok, thailand, the, thai, government, is, playing, a, role, in, supporting, the, betta, fish, breeders, as, not, only, a, source, of, revenue, for, the, country, and, being, a, symbol, of, cultural, significance, betta, fish, breeders, have, become, a, focal, point, of, the, government, s, assistance, as, they, lack, the, capital, and, resources, when, wanting, to, expand, their, businesses, the, dof, and, partner, agencies, created, the, ornamental, fish, strategy, plan, during, 2013, 2016, it, was, created, with, the, intention, of, making, thailand, the, number, one, exporter, of, aquarium, fish, in, asia, the, three, goals, of, the, program, included, 1, improving, quality, and, quantity, of, ornamental, fish, 2, enhancing, the, ornamental, fish, trade, on, a, domestic, and, international, level, 3, uplifting, ornamental, fish, farmers, to, become, successful, farmer, entrepreneurs, this, program, also, included, trainings, in, basic, english, how, to, navigate, advertisement, on, social, media, and, the, internet, pricing, and, classification, of, fish, and, value, added, and, creative, product, dr, sermwatanakul, also, highlights, that, around, 40, of, betta, fish, farmers, registered, with, the, dof, are, women, and, claims, that, the, industry, empowers, women, she, notes, that, they, are, actively, engaged, in, the, marketing, of, their, bettas, online, alluding, to, their, abilities, in, speaking, other, languages, and, that, they, succeed, in, the, international, market
