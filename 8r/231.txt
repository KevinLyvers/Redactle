sperm, pl, sperm, or, sperms, is, the, male, reproductive, cell, or, gamete, in, anisogamous, forms, of, sexual, reproduction, forms, in, which, there, is, a, larger, female, reproductive, cell, and, a, smaller, male, one, animals, produce, motile, sperm, with, a, tail, known, as, a, flagellum, which, are, known, as, spermatozoa, while, some, red, algae, and, fungi, produce, non, motile, sperm, cells, known, as, spermatia, flowering, plants, contain, non, motile, sperm, inside, pollen, while, some, more, basal, plants, like, ferns, and, some, gymnosperms, have, motile, sperm, sperm, cells, form, during, the, process, known, as, spermatogenesis, which, in, amniotes, reptiles, and, mammals, takes, place, in, the, seminiferous, tubules, of, the, testicles, this, process, involves, the, production, of, several, successive, sperm, cell, precursors, starting, with, spermatogonia, which, differentiate, into, spermatocytes, the, spermatocytes, then, undergo, meiosis, reducing, their, chromosome, number, by, half, which, produces, spermatids, the, spermatids, then, mature, and, in, animals, construct, a, tail, or, flagellum, which, gives, rise, to, the, mature, motile, sperm, cell, this, whole, process, occurs, constantly, and, takes, around, 3, months, from, start, to, finish, sperm, cells, cannot, divide, and, have, a, limited, lifespan, but, after, fusion, with, egg, cells, during, fertilization, a, new, organism, begins, developing, starting, as, a, totipotent, zygote, the, human, sperm, cell, is, haploid, so, that, its, 23, chromosomes, can, join, the, 23, chromosomes, of, the, female, egg, to, form, a, diploid, cell, with, 46, paired, chromosomes, in, mammals, sperm, is, stored, in, the, epididymis, and, released, through, the, penis, in, semen, during, ejaculation, the, word, sperm, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, sperma, meaning, seed, it, is, generally, accepted, that, isogamy, is, the, ancestor, to, sperm, and, eggs, because, there, are, no, fossil, records, of, the, evolution, of, sperm, and, eggs, from, isogamy, there, is, a, strong, emphasis, on, mathematical, models, to, understand, the, evolution, of, sperm, a, widespread, hypothesis, states, that, sperm, evolved, rapidly, but, there, is, no, direct, evidence, that, sperm, evolved, at, a, fast, rate, or, before, other, male, characteristics, the, main, sperm, function, is, to, reach, the, ovum, and, fuse, with, it, to, deliver, two, sub, cellular, structures, i, the, male, pronucleus, that, contains, the, genetic, material, and, ii, the, centrioles, that, are, structures, that, help, organize, the, microtubule, cytoskeleton, the, nuclear, dna, in, sperm, cells, is, haploid, that, is, they, contribute, only, one, copy, of, each, paternal, chromosome, pair, mitochondria, in, human, sperm, contain, no, or, very, little, dna, because, mtdna, is, degraded, while, sperm, cells, are, maturing, hence, they, typically, do, not, contribute, any, genetic, material, to, their, offspring, the, mammalian, sperm, cell, can, be, divided, in, 2, parts, connected, by, a, neck, during, fertilization, the, sperm, provides, three, essential, parts, to, the, oocyte, 1, a, signalling, or, activating, factor, which, causes, the, metabolically, dormant, oocyte, to, activate, 2, the, haploid, paternal, genome, 3, the, centriole, which, is, responsible, for, forming, the, centrosome, and, microtubule, system, the, spermatozoa, of, animals, are, produced, through, spermatogenesis, inside, the, male, gonads, testicles, via, meiotic, division, the, initial, spermatozoon, process, takes, around, 70, days, to, complete, the, process, starts, with, the, production, of, spermatogonia, from, germ, cell, precursors, these, divide, and, differentiate, into, spermatocytes, which, undergo, meiosis, to, form, spermatids, in, the, spermatid, stage, the, sperm, develops, the, familiar, tail, the, next, stage, where, it, becomes, fully, mature, takes, around, 60, days, when, it, is, called, a, spermatozoan, sperm, cells, are, carried, out, of, the, male, body, in, a, fluid, known, as, semen, human, sperm, cells, can, survive, within, the, female, reproductive, tract, for, more, than, 5, days, post, coitus, semen, is, produced, in, the, seminal, vesicles, prostate, gland, and, urethral, glands, in, 2016, scientists, at, nanjing, medical, university, claimed, they, had, produced, cells, resembling, mouse, spermatids, from, mouse, embryonic, stem, cells, artificially, they, injected, these, spermatids, into, mouse, eggs, and, produced, pups, sperm, quantity, and, quality, are, the, main, parameters, in, semen, quality, which, is, a, measure, of, the, ability, of, semen, to, accomplish, fertilization, thus, in, humans, it, is, a, measure, of, fertility, in, a, man, the, genetic, quality, of, sperm, as, well, as, its, volume, and, motility, all, typically, decrease, with, age, dna, double, strand, breaks, in, sperm, increase, with, age, also, apoptosis, decreases, with, age, suggesting, that, the, increase, in, damaged, dna, of, sperm, as, men, age, occurs, partly, as, a, result, of, less, efficient, cell, selection, apoptosis, operating, during, or, after, spermatogenesis, dna, damages, present, in, sperm, cells, in, the, period, after, meiosis, but, before, fertilization, may, be, repaired, in, the, fertilized, egg, but, if, not, repaired, can, have, serious, deleterious, effects, on, fertility, and, the, developing, embryo, human, sperm, cells, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, free, radical, attack, and, the, generation, of, oxidative, dna, damage, such, as, that, from, 8, oxo, 2, deoxyguanosine, the, postmeiotic, phase, of, mouse, spermatogenesis, is, very, sensitive, to, environmental, genotoxic, agents, because, as, male, germ, cells, form, mature, sperm, they, progressively, lose, the, ability, to, repair, dna, damage, irradiation, of, male, mice, during, late, spermatogenesis, can, induce, damage, that, persists, for, at, least, 7, days, in, the, fertilizing, sperm, cells, and, disruption, of, maternal, dna, double, strand, break, repair, pathways, increases, sperm, cell, derived, chromosomal, aberrations, treatment, of, male, mice, with, melphalan, a, bifunctional, alkylating, agent, frequently, employed, in, chemotherapy, induces, dna, lesions, during, meiosis, that, may, persist, in, an, unrepaired, state, as, germ, cells, progress, through, dna, repair, competent, phases, of, spermatogenic, development, such, unrepaired, dna, damages, in, sperm, cells, after, fertilization, can, lead, to, offspring, with, various, abnormalities, related, to, sperm, quality, is, sperm, size, at, least, in, some, animals, for, instance, the, sperm, of, some, species, of, fruit, fly, drosophila, are, up, to, 5, 8, cm, long, about, 20, times, as, long, as, the, fly, itself, longer, sperm, cells, are, better, than, their, shorter, counterparts, at, displacing, competitors, from, the, female, s, seminal, receptacle, the, benefit, to, females, is, that, only, healthy, males, carry, good, genes, that, can, produce, long, sperm, in, sufficient, quantities, to, outcompete, their, competitors, some, sperm, banks, hold, up, to, 170, litres, 37, imp, gal, 45, us, gal, of, sperm, in, addition, to, ejaculation, it, is, possible, to, extract, sperm, through, testicular, sperm, extraction, on, the, global, market, denmark, has, a, well, developed, system, of, human, sperm, export, this, success, mainly, comes, from, the, reputation, of, danish, sperm, donors, for, being, of, high, quality, and, in, contrast, with, the, law, in, the, other, nordic, countries, gives, donors, the, choice, of, being, either, anonymous, or, non, anonymous, to, the, receiving, couple, furthermore, nordic, sperm, donors, tend, to, be, tall, and, highly, educated, and, have, altruistic, motives, for, their, donations, partly, due, to, the, relatively, low, monetary, compensation, in, nordic, countries, more, than, 50, countries, worldwide, are, importers, of, danish, sperm, including, paraguay, canada, kenya, and, hong, kong, however, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, of, the, us, has, banned, import, of, any, sperm, motivated, by, a, risk, of, transmission, of, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, although, such, a, risk, is, insignificant, since, artificial, insemination, is, very, different, from, the, route, of, transmission, of, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, the, prevalence, of, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, for, donors, is, at, most, one, in, a, million, and, if, the, donor, was, a, carrier, the, infectious, proteins, would, still, have, to, cross, the, blood, testis, barrier, to, make, transmission, possible, sperm, were, first, observed, in, 1677, by, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, using, a, microscope, he, described, them, as, being, animalcules, little, animals, probably, due, to, his, belief, in, preformationism, which, thought, that, each, sperm, contained, a, fully, formed, but, small, human, ejaculated, fluids, are, detected, by, ultraviolet, light, irrespective, of, the, structure, or, colour, of, the, surface, sperm, heads, e, g, from, vaginal, swabs, are, still, detected, by, microscopy, using, the, christmas, tree, stain, method, i, e, kernechtrot, picroindigocarmine, kpic, staining, sperm, cells, in, algal, and, many, plant, gametophytes, are, produced, in, male, gametangia, antheridia, via, mitotic, division, in, flowering, plants, sperm, nuclei, are, produced, inside, pollen, motile, sperm, cells, typically, move, via, flagella, and, require, a, water, medium, in, order, to, swim, toward, the, egg, for, fertilization, in, animals, most, of, the, energy, for, sperm, motility, is, derived, from, the, metabolism, of, fructose, carried, in, the, seminal, fluid, this, takes, place, in, the, mitochondria, located, in, the, sperm, s, midpiece, at, the, base, of, the, sperm, head, these, cells, cannot, swim, backwards, due, to, the, nature, of, their, propulsion, the, uniflagellated, sperm, cells, with, one, flagellum, of, animals, are, referred, to, as, spermatozoa, and, are, known, to, vary, in, size, motile, sperm, are, also, produced, by, many, protists, and, the, gametophytes, of, bryophytes, ferns, and, some, gymnosperms, such, as, cycads, and, ginkgo, the, sperm, cells, are, the, only, flagellated, cells, in, the, life, cycle, of, these, plants, in, many, ferns, and, lycophytes, cycads, and, ginkgo, they, are, multi, flagellated, carrying, more, than, one, flagellum, in, nematodes, the, sperm, cells, are, amoeboid, and, crawl, rather, than, swim, towards, the, egg, cell, non, motile, sperm, cells, called, spermatia, lack, flagella, and, therefore, cannot, swim, spermatia, are, produced, in, a, spermatangium, because, spermatia, cannot, swim, they, depend, on, their, environment, to, carry, them, to, the, egg, cell, some, red, algae, such, as, polysiphonia, produce, non, motile, spermatia, that, are, spread, by, water, currents, after, their, release, the, spermatia, of, rust, fungi, are, covered, with, a, sticky, substance, they, are, produced, in, flask, shaped, structures, containing, nectar, which, attract, flies, that, transfer, the, spermatia, to, nearby, hyphae, for, fertilization, in, a, mechanism, similar, to, insect, pollination, in, flowering, plants, fungal, spermatia, also, called, pycniospores, especially, in, the, uredinales, may, be, confused, with, conidia, conidia, are, spores, that, germinate, independently, of, fertilization, whereas, spermatia, are, gametes, that, are, required, for, fertilization, in, some, fungi, such, as, neurospora, crassa, spermatia, are, identical, to, microconidia, as, they, can, perform, both, functions, of, fertilization, as, well, as, giving, rise, to, new, organisms, without, fertilization, in, almost, all, embryophytes, including, most, gymnosperms, and, all, angiosperms, the, male, gametophytes, pollen, grains, are, the, primary, mode, of, dispersal, for, example, via, wind, or, insect, pollination, eliminating, the, need, for, water, to, bridge, the, gap, between, male, and, female, each, pollen, grain, contains, a, spermatogenous, generative, cell, once, the, pollen, lands, on, the, stigma, of, a, receptive, flower, it, germinates, and, starts, growing, a, pollen, tube, through, the, carpel, before, the, tube, reaches, the, ovule, the, nucleus, of, the, generative, cell, in, the, pollen, grain, divides, and, gives, rise, to, two, sperm, nuclei, which, are, then, discharged, through, the, tube, into, the, ovule, for, fertilization, in, some, protists, fertilization, also, involves, sperm, nuclei, rather, than, cells, migrating, toward, the, egg, cell, through, a, fertilization, tube, oomycetes, form, sperm, nuclei, in, a, syncytical, antheridium, surrounding, the, egg, cells, the, sperm, nuclei, reach, the, eggs, through, fertilization, tubes, similar, to, the, pollen, tube, mechanism, in, plants, most, sperm, cells, have, centrioles, in, the, sperm, neck, sperm, of, many, animals, has, two, typical, centrioles, known, as, the, proximal, centriole, and, distal, centriole, some, animals, including, humans, and, bovines, have, a, single, typical, centriole, the, proximal, centriole, as, well, as, a, second, centriole, with, atypical, structure, mice, and, rats, have, no, recognizable, sperm, centrioles, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, has, a, single, centriole, and, an, atypical, centriole, named, the, proximal, centriole, like, the, sperm, tail, is, a, specialized, type, of, cilium, aka, flagella, in, many, animals, the, sperm, tail, is, formed, through, the, unique, process, of, cytosolic, ciliogenesis, in, which, all, or, part, of, the, sperm, tail, s, axoneme, is, formed, in, the, cytoplasm, or, gets, exposed, to, the, cytoplasm
