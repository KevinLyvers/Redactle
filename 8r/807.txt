the, pig, sus, domesticus, also, called, swine, pl, swine, or, hog, is, an, omnivorous, domesticated, even, toed, hoofed, mammal, it, is, named, the, domestic, pig, when, distinguishing, it, from, other, members, of, the, genus, sus, it, is, considered, a, subspecies, of, sus, scrofa, the, wild, boar, or, eurasian, boar, by, some, authorities, but, as, a, distinct, species, by, others, pigs, were, domesticated, in, the, neolithic, both, in, east, asia, and, in, the, near, east, when, domesticated, pigs, arrived, in, europe, they, extensively, interbred, with, wild, boar, but, retained, their, domesticated, features, pigs, are, farmed, primarily, for, meat, called, pork, the, animal, s, skin, or, hide, is, used, for, leather, china, is, the, world, s, largest, pork, producer, followed, by, the, european, union, and, then, the, united, states, around, 1, 5, billion, pigs, are, raised, each, year, producing, some, 120, million, tonnes, of, meat, often, cured, as, bacon, some, are, kept, as, pets, pigs, have, featured, in, human, culture, since, neolithic, times, appearing, in, art, and, literature, for, children, and, adults, and, celebrated, in, cities, such, as, bologna, for, their, meat, products, the, pig, has, a, large, head, with, a, long, snout, strengthened, by, a, special, prenasal, bone, and, a, disk, of, cartilage, at, the, tip, the, snout, is, used, to, dig, into, the, soil, to, find, food, and, is, an, acute, sense, organ, the, dental, formula, of, adult, pigs, is, 3, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, giving, a, total, of, 44, teeth, the, rear, teeth, are, adapted, for, crushing, in, males, the, canine, teeth, can, form, tusks, which, grow, continuously, and, are, sharpened, by, grinding, against, each, other, there, are, four, hoofed, toes, on, each, foot, the, two, larger, central, toes, bear, most, of, the, weight, while, the, outer, two, are, also, used, in, soft, ground, most, pigs, have, rather, sparsely, bristled, hair, on, their, skin, though, there, are, some, woolly, coated, breeds, such, as, the, mangalitsa, adult, pigs, generally, weigh, between, 140, and, 300, kg, 310, and, 660, lb, though, some, breeds, can, exceed, this, range, exceptionally, a, pig, called, big, bill, weighed, 1, 157, kg, 2, 551, lb, and, had, a, shoulder, height, of, 1, 5, m, 4, ft, 11, in, pigs, possess, both, apocrine, and, eccrine, sweat, glands, although, the, latter, are, limited, to, the, snout, pigs, like, other, hairless, mammals, such, as, elephants, do, not, use, thermal, sweat, glands, in, cooling, pigs, are, less, able, than, many, other, mammals, to, dissipate, heat, from, wet, mucous, membranes, in, the, mouth, by, panting, their, thermoneutral, zone, is, 16, 22, c, 61, 72, f, at, higher, temperatures, pigs, lose, heat, by, wallowing, in, mud, or, water, via, evaporative, cooling, although, it, has, been, suggested, that, wallowing, may, serve, other, functions, such, as, protection, from, sunburn, ecto, parasite, control, and, scent, marking, pigs, are, among, four, mammalian, species, with, mutations, in, the, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptor, that, protect, against, snake, venom, mongooses, honey, badgers, hedgehogs, and, pigs, all, have, different, modifications, to, the, receptor, pocket, which, prevents, neurotoxin, from, binding, pigs, have, small, lungs, for, their, body, size, and, are, thus, more, susceptible, than, other, domesticated, animals, to, fatal, bronchitis, and, pneumonia, the, genome, of, the, pig, has, been, sequenced, it, contains, about, 22, 342, protein, coding, genes, domestic, pigs, are, related, to, other, pig, species, as, shown, in, the, cladogram, based, on, phylogenetic, analysis, using, mitochondrial, dna, babirusa, red, river, hog, warthogs, visayan, warty, pig, philippine, warty, pig, bornean, bearded, pig, javan, warty, pig, east, asian, pigs, european, pigs, the, pig, is, most, often, considered, to, be, a, subspecies, of, the, wild, boar, which, was, given, the, name, sus, scrofa, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, following, from, this, the, formal, name, of, the, pig, is, sus, scrofa, domesticus, however, in, 1777, johann, christian, polycarp, erxleben, classified, the, pig, as, a, separate, species, from, the, wild, boar, he, gave, it, the, name, sus, domesticus, still, used, by, some, taxonomists, the, american, society, of, mammalogists, considers, it, a, separate, species, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, pigs, were, domesticated, from, wild, boar, in, the, near, east, in, or, around, the, tigris, basin, being, managed, in, a, semi, wild, state, much, as, they, are, managed, by, some, modern, new, guineans, there, were, pigs, in, cyprus, more, than, 11, 400, years, ago, introduced, from, the, mainland, implying, domestication, in, the, adjacent, mainland, by, then, pigs, were, separately, domesticated, in, china, starting, some, 8, 000, years, ago, in, the, near, east, pig, husbandry, spread, for, the, next, few, millennia, it, reduced, gradually, during, the, bronze, age, as, rural, populations, instead, focused, on, commodity, producing, livestock, but, it, was, sustained, in, cities, domestication, did, not, involve, reproductive, isolation, with, population, bottlenecks, western, asian, pigs, were, introduced, into, europe, where, they, crossed, with, wild, boar, there, appears, to, have, been, interbreeding, with, a, now, extinct, ghost, population, of, wild, pigs, during, the, pleistocene, the, genomes, of, domestic, pigs, show, strong, selection, for, genes, affecting, behavior, and, morphology, human, selection, for, domestic, traits, likely, counteracted, the, homogenizing, effect, of, gene, flow, from, wild, boars, and, created, domestication, islands, in, the, genome, pigs, arrived, in, europe, from, the, near, east, at, least, 8, 500, years, ago, over, the, next, 3, 000, years, they, interbred, with, european, wild, boar, until, their, genome, showed, less, than, 5, near, eastern, ancestry, yet, retained, their, domesticated, features, dna, evidence, from, subfossil, remains, of, teeth, and, jawbones, of, neolithic, pigs, shows, that, the, first, domestic, pigs, in, europe, were, brought, from, the, near, east, this, stimulated, the, domestication, of, local, european, wild, boar, resulting, in, a, third, domestication, event, with, the, near, eastern, genes, dying, out, in, european, pig, stock, more, recently, there, have, been, complex, exchanges, with, european, domesticated, lines, being, exported, in, turn, to, the, ancient, near, east, historical, records, indicate, that, asian, pigs, were, again, introduced, into, europe, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, among, the, animals, that, the, spanish, introduced, to, the, chilo, archipelago, in, the, 16th, century, columbian, exchange, pigs, were, the, most, successful, in, adapting, to, local, conditions, the, pigs, benefited, from, abundant, shellfish, and, algae, exposed, by, the, large, tides, of, the, archipelago, pigs, were, brought, to, southeastern, north, america, from, europe, by, de, soto, and, other, early, spanish, explorers, escaped, pigs, became, feral, pigs, have, escaped, from, farms, and, gone, feral, in, many, parts, of, the, world, feral, pigs, in, the, southeastern, united, states, have, migrated, north, to, the, midwest, where, many, state, agencies, have, programs, to, remove, them, feral, pigs, in, new, zealand, and, northern, queensland, have, caused, substantial, environmental, damage, feral, hybrids, of, the, european, wild, boar, with, the, domestic, pig, are, disruptive, to, both, environment, and, agriculture, as, they, destroy, crops, spread, animal, diseases, including, foot, and, mouth, disease, and, consume, wildlife, such, as, juvenile, seabirds, and, young, tortoises, feral, pig, damage, is, especially, an, issue, in, southeastern, south, america, female, pigs, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 3, 12, months, of, age, and, come, into, estrus, every, 18, 24, days, if, they, are, not, successfully, bred, the, variation, in, ovulation, rate, can, be, attributed, to, intrinsic, factors, such, as, age, and, genotype, as, well, as, extrinsic, factors, like, nutrition, environment, and, the, supplementation, of, exogenous, hormones, the, gestation, period, averages, 112, 120, days, estrus, lasts, two, to, three, days, and, the, female, s, displayed, receptiveness, to, mate, is, known, as, standing, heat, standing, heat, is, a, reflexive, response, that, is, stimulated, when, the, female, is, in, contact, with, the, saliva, of, a, sexually, mature, boar, androstenol, is, one, of, the, pheromones, produced, in, the, submaxillary, salivary, glands, of, boars, that, trigger, the, female, s, response, the, female, cervix, contains, a, series, of, five, interdigitating, pads, or, folds, that, hold, the, boar, s, corkscrew, shaped, penis, during, copulation, females, have, bicornuate, uteruses, and, two, conceptuses, must, be, present, in, both, uterine, horns, to, enable, pregnancy, to, proceed, the, mother, s, body, recognises, that, it, is, pregnant, on, days, 11, to, 12, of, pregnancy, and, is, marked, by, the, corpus, luteum, s, producing, the, sex, hormone, progesterone, to, sustain, the, pregnancy, the, embryo, signals, to, the, corpus, luteum, with, the, hormones, estradiol, and, prostaglandin, e2, this, signaling, acts, on, both, the, endometrium, and, luteal, tissue, to, prevent, the, regression, of, the, corpus, luteum, by, activation, of, genes, that, are, responsible, for, corpus, luteum, maintenance, during, mid, to, late, pregnancy, the, corpus, luteum, relies, primarily, on, luteinizing, hormone, for, maintenance, until, birth, archeological, evidence, indicates, that, medieval, european, pigs, farrowed, or, bore, a, litter, of, piglets, once, per, year, by, the, nineteenth, century, european, piglets, routinely, double, farrowed, or, bore, two, litters, of, piglets, per, year, it, is, unclear, when, this, shift, occurred, pigs, have, a, maximum, life, span, of, about, 27, years, a, characteristic, of, pigs, which, they, share, with, carnivores, is, nest, building, sows, root, in, the, ground, to, create, depressions, the, size, of, their, body, and, then, build, nest, mounds, using, twigs, and, leaves, softer, in, the, middle, in, which, to, give, birth, when, the, mound, reaches, the, desired, height, she, places, large, branches, up, to, 2, metres, in, length, on, the, surface, she, enters, the, mound, and, roots, around, to, create, a, depression, within, the, gathered, material, she, then, gives, birth, in, a, lying, position, unlike, other, artiodactyls, which, usually, stand, while, birthing, nest, building, occurs, during, the, last, 24, hours, before, the, onset, of, farrowing, and, becomes, most, intense, 12, to, 6, hours, before, farrowing, the, sow, separates, from, the, group, and, seeks, a, suitable, nest, site, with, well, drained, soil, and, shelter, from, rain, and, wind, this, provides, the, offspring, with, shelter, comfort, and, thermoregulation, the, nest, provides, protection, against, weather, and, predators, while, keeping, the, piglets, close, to, the, sow, and, away, from, the, rest, of, the, herd, this, ensures, they, do, not, get, trampled, on, and, prevents, other, piglets, from, stealing, milk, from, the, sow, the, onset, of, nest, building, is, triggered, by, a, rise, in, prolactin, level, caused, by, a, decrease, in, progesterone, and, an, increase, in, prostaglandin, the, gathering, of, nest, material, seems, to, be, regulated, more, by, external, stimuli, such, as, temperature, pigs, have, complex, nursing, and, suckling, behaviour, nursing, occurs, every, 50, 60, minutes, and, the, sow, requires, stimulation, from, piglets, before, milk, let, down, sensory, inputs, vocalisation, odours, from, mammary, and, birth, fluids, and, hair, patterns, of, the, sow, are, particularly, important, immediately, post, birth, to, facilitate, teat, location, by, the, piglets, initially, the, piglets, compete, for, position, at, the, udder, then, the, piglets, massage, around, their, respective, teats, with, their, snouts, during, which, time, the, sow, grunts, at, slow, regular, intervals, each, series, of, grunts, varies, in, frequency, tone, and, magnitude, indicating, the, stages, of, nursing, to, the, piglets, the, phase, of, competition, for, teats, and, of, nosing, the, udder, lasts, for, about, a, minute, ending, when, milk, begins, to, flow, the, piglets, then, hold, the, teats, in, their, mouths, and, suck, with, slow, mouth, movements, one, per, second, and, the, rate, of, the, sow, s, grunting, increases, for, approximately, 20, seconds, the, grunt, peak, in, the, third, phase, of, suckling, does, not, coincide, with, milk, ejection, but, rather, the, release, of, oxytocin, from, the, pituitary, into, the, bloodstream, phase, four, coincides, with, the, period, of, main, milk, flow, 10, 20, seconds, when, the, piglets, suddenly, withdraw, slightly, from, the, udder, and, start, sucking, with, rapid, mouth, movements, of, about, three, per, second, the, sow, grunts, rapidly, lower, in, tone, and, often, in, quick, runs, of, three, or, four, during, this, phase, finally, the, flow, stops, and, so, does, the, grunting, of, the, sow, the, piglets, may, dart, from, teat, to, teat, and, recommence, suckling, with, slow, movements, or, nosing, the, udder, piglets, massage, and, suckle, the, sow, s, teats, after, milk, flow, ceases, as, a, way, of, letting, the, sow, know, their, nutritional, status, this, helps, her, to, regulate, the, amount, of, milk, released, from, that, teat, in, future, sucklings, the, more, intense, the, post, feed, massaging, of, a, teat, the, more, milk, that, teat, later, releases, in, pigs, dominance, hierarchies, are, formed, at, an, early, age, piglets, are, precocious, and, attempt, to, suckle, soon, after, being, born, the, piglets, are, born, with, sharp, teeth, and, fight, for, the, anterior, teats, as, these, produce, more, milk, once, established, this, teat, order, remains, stable, each, piglet, tends, to, feed, on, a, particular, teat, or, group, of, teats, stimulation, of, the, anterior, teats, appears, to, be, important, in, causing, milk, letdown, so, it, might, be, advantageous, to, the, entire, litter, to, have, these, teats, occupied, by, healthy, piglets, piglets, locate, teats, by, sight, and, then, by, olfaction, pig, behaviour, is, intermediate, between, that, of, other, artiodactyls, and, of, carnivores, pigs, seek, out, the, company, of, other, pigs, and, often, huddle, to, maintain, physical, contact, but, they, do, not, naturally, form, large, herds, they, live, in, groups, of, about, 8, 10, adult, sows, some, young, individuals, and, some, single, males, pigs, confined, in, a, simplified, crowded, or, uncomfortable, environment, may, resort, to, tail, biting, farmers, sometimes, dock, the, tails, of, pigs, to, prevent, the, problem, or, may, enrich, the, environment, with, toys, or, other, objects, to, reduce, the, risk, because, of, their, relative, lack, of, sweat, glands, pigs, often, control, their, body, temperature, using, behavioural, thermoregulation, wallowing, coating, the, body, with, mud, is, a, common, behaviour, they, do, not, submerge, completely, under, the, mud, but, vary, the, depth, and, duration, of, wallowing, depending, on, environmental, conditions, adult, pigs, start, wallowing, once, the, ambient, temperature, is, around, 17, 21, c, 63, 70, f, they, cover, themselves, in, mud, from, head, to, tail, they, may, use, mud, as, a, sunscreen, or, to, keep, parasites, away, most, bristled, pigs, blow, their, coat, meaning, that, they, shed, most, of, the, longer, coarser, stiff, hair, once, a, year, usually, in, spring, or, early, summer, to, prepare, for, the, warmer, months, ahead, where, pigs, are, allowed, to, roam, freely, they, walk, roughly, 4, km, daily, scavenging, within, a, home, range, of, around, a, hectare, farmers, in, africa, often, choose, such, a, low, input, free, range, production, system, if, conditions, permit, pigs, feed, continuously, for, many, hours, and, then, sleep, for, many, hours, in, contrast, to, ruminants, which, tend, to, feed, for, a, short, time, and, then, sleep, for, a, short, time, pigs, are, omnivorous, and, versatile, in, their, feeding, behaviour, they, primarily, eat, leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and, flowers, rooting, is, an, instinctual, comforting, behaviour, in, pigs, characterized, by, nudging, the, snout, into, something, it, first, happens, when, piglets, are, born, to, obtain, their, mother, s, milk, and, can, become, a, habitual, obsessive, behaviour, most, prominent, in, animals, weaned, too, early, pigs, root, and, dig, into, the, ground, to, forage, for, food, rooting, is, also, a, means, of, communication, pigs, are, relatively, intelligent, animals, roughly, on, par, with, dogs, they, distinguish, each, other, as, individuals, spend, time, in, play, and, form, structured, communities, they, have, good, long, term, memory, and, they, experience, emotions, changing, their, behaviour, in, response, to, the, emotional, states, of, other, pigs, in, terms, of, experimental, tasks, pigs, can, perform, tasks, that, require, them, to, identify, the, locations, of, objects, they, can, solve, mazes, and, they, can, work, with, a, simple, language, of, symbols, they, display, self, recognition, in, a, mirror, pigs, have, been, trained, to, associate, different, sorts, of, music, bach, and, a, military, march, with, food, and, social, isolation, respectively, and, could, communicate, the, resulting, positive, or, negative, emotion, to, untrained, pigs, pigs, can, be, trained, to, use, a, joystick, with, their, snout, to, select, a, target, on, screen, pigs, have, panoramic, vision, of, approximately, 310, and, binocular, vision, of, 35, to, 50, it, is, thought, they, have, no, eye, accommodation, other, animals, that, have, no, accommodation, e, g, sheep, lift, their, heads, to, see, distant, objects, the, extent, to, which, pigs, have, colour, vision, is, still, a, source, of, some, debate, however, the, presence, of, cone, cells, in, the, retina, with, two, distinct, wavelength, sensitivities, blue, and, green, suggests, that, at, least, some, colour, vision, is, present, pigs, have, a, well, developed, sense, of, smell, this, is, exploited, in, europe, where, trained, pigs, find, underground, truffles, pigs, have, 1, 113, genes, for, smell, receptors, compared, to, 1, 094, in, dogs, this, may, indicate, an, acute, sense, of, smell, but, against, this, insects, have, only, around, 50, to, 100, such, genes, but, make, extensive, use, of, olfaction, olfactory, rather, than, visual, stimuli, are, used, in, the, identification, of, other, pigs, hearing, is, well, developed, sounds, are, localised, by, moving, the, head, pigs, use, auditory, stimuli, extensively, for, communication, in, all, social, activities, alarm, or, aversive, stimuli, are, transmitted, to, other, pigs, not, only, by, auditory, cues, but, also, by, pheromones, similarly, recognition, between, the, sow, and, her, piglets, is, by, olfactory, and, vocal, cues, pigs, are, subject, to, many, pests, and, diseases, which, can, seriously, affect, productivity, and, cause, death, these, include, parasites, such, as, ascaris, roundworms, virus, diseases, such, as, the, tick, borne, african, swine, fever, bacterial, infections, such, as, clostridium, arthritis, caused, by, mycoplasma, and, stillbirths, caused, by, parvovirus, some, parasites, of, pigs, are, a, public, health, risk, as, they, can, be, transmitted, to, humans, in, undercooked, pork, these, are, the, pork, tapeworm, taenia, solium, a, protozoan, toxoplasma, gondii, and, a, nematode, trichinella, spiralis, transmission, can, be, prevented, by, thorough, sanitation, on, the, farm, by, meat, inspection, and, careful, commercial, processing, and, by, thorough, cooking, or, alternatively, by, sufficient, freezing, and, curing, pigs, have, been, raised, outdoors, and, sometimes, allowed, to, forage, in, woods, or, pastures, in, industrialized, nations, pig, production, has, largely, switched, to, large, scale, intensive, pig, farming, this, has, lowered, production, costs, but, has, caused, concern, about, possible, cruelty, as, consumers, have, become, concerned, with, the, humane, treatment, of, livestock, demand, for, pasture, raised, pork, in, these, nations, has, increased, most, pigs, in, the, us, receive, ractopamine, a, beta, agonist, drug, which, promotes, muscle, instead, of, fat, and, quicker, weight, gain, requiring, less, feed, to, reach, finishing, weight, and, producing, less, manure, china, has, requested, that, pork, exports, be, ractopamine, free, with, a, population, of, around, 1, billion, individuals, the, domesticated, pig, is, one, of, the, most, numerous, large, mammals, on, the, planet, like, all, animals, pigs, are, susceptible, to, adverse, impacts, from, climate, change, such, as, heat, stress, from, increased, annual, temperatures, and, more, intense, heatwaves, heat, stress, has, increased, rapidly, between, 1981, and, 2017, on, pig, farms, in, europe, installing, a, ground, coupled, heat, exchanger, is, an, effective, intervention, around, 600, breeds, of, pig, have, been, created, by, farmers, around, the, world, mainly, in, europe, and, asia, differing, in, coloration, shape, and, size, according, to, the, livestock, conservancy, as, of, 2016, three, breeds, of, pig, are, critically, rare, having, a, global, population, of, fewer, than, 2000, they, are, the, choctaw, hog, the, mulefoot, and, the, ossabaw, island, hog, the, smallest, known, pig, breed, in, the, world, is, the, g, ttingen, minipig, typically, weighing, about, 26, kilograms, 57, lb, as, a, healthy, full, grown, adult, vietnamese, pot, bellied, pigs, a, miniature, breed, of, pig, have, been, kept, as, pets, in, the, united, states, beginning, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, pigs, are, intelligent, social, creatures, they, are, considered, hypoallergenic, and, are, known, to, do, quite, well, with, people, who, have, the, usual, animal, allergies, since, these, animals, are, known, to, have, a, life, expectancy, of, 15, to, 20, years, they, require, a, long, term, commitment, given, pigs, are, bred, primarily, as, livestock, and, have, not, been, bred, as, companion, animals, for, very, long, selective, breeding, for, a, placid, or, biddable, temperament, is, not, well, established, pigs, have, radically, different, psychology, and, behaviours, compared, to, dogs, and, exhibit, fight, or, flight, instincts, an, independent, nature, and, natural, assertiveness, male, and, female, swine, that, have, not, been, de, sexed, may, express, unwanted, aggressive, behavior, and, are, prone, to, developing, serious, health, issues, as, rooting, is, found, to, be, comforting, pigs, kept, in, the, house, may, root, household, objects, furniture, or, surfaces, pet, pigs, should, be, let, outside, to, allow, them, to, fulfill, their, natural, desire, of, rooting, around, approximately, 1, 5, billion, pigs, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, meat, the, pork, belly, futures, contract, became, an, icon, of, commodities, trading, it, appears, in, depictions, of, the, arena, in, popular, entertainment, such, as, the, 1983, film, trading, places, trade, in, pork, bellies, declined, and, they, were, delisted, from, the, chicago, mercantile, exchange, in, 2011, in, 2023, china, produced, more, pork, than, any, other, country, 55, million, tonnes, followed, by, the, european, union, with, 22, 8, million, tonnes, and, the, united, states, with, 12, 5, million, tonnes, global, production, in, 2023, was, 120, million, tonnes, india, despite, its, large, population, consumed, under, 0, 3, million, tonnes, of, pork, in, 2023, international, trade, in, pork, meat, not, consumed, in, the, producing, country, reached, 13, million, tonnes, in, 2020, pigs, are, farmed, primarily, for, meat, called, pork, pork, is, eaten, in, the, form, of, pork, chops, loin, or, rib, roasts, shoulder, joints, steaks, and, loin, also, called, fillet, the, many, meat, products, made, from, pork, include, ham, bacon, mainly, from, the, back, and, belly, and, sausages, pork, is, further, made, into, charcuterie, products, such, as, terrines, galantines, p, t, s, and, confits, some, sausages, such, as, salami, are, fermented, and, air, dried, to, be, eaten, raw, there, are, many, types, the, original, italian, varieties, including, genovese, milanese, and, cacciatorino, with, spicier, kinds, from, the, south, of, italy, including, calabrese, napoletano, and, peperone, the, hide, is, made, into, pigskin, leather, which, is, soft, and, durable, it, can, be, brushed, to, form, suede, leather, these, are, used, for, products, such, as, gloves, wallets, suede, shoes, and, leather, jackets, in, the, 16th, century, pig, skin, was, the, most, popular, book, binding, material, in, germany, though, calf, skin, was, more, common, elsewhere, pigs, both, as, live, animals, and, as, a, source, of, post, mortem, tissues, are, valuable, animal, models, because, of, their, biological, physiological, and, anatomical, similarities, to, human, beings, for, instance, human, skin, is, very, similar, to, the, pigskin, therefore, pigskin, has, been, used, in, many, preclinical, studies, pigs, are, good, non, human, candidates, for, organ, donation, to, humans, and, in, 2021, became, the, first, animal, to, successfully, donate, an, organ, to, a, human, body, the, procedure, used, a, donor, pig, genetically, engineered, not, to, have, a, specific, carbohydrate, that, the, human, body, considers, a, threat, galactose, alpha, 1, 3, galactose, pigs, are, good, for, human, donation, as, the, risk, of, cross, species, disease, transmission, is, reduced, by, the, considerable, phylogenetic, distance, from, humans, they, are, readily, available, and, the, danger, of, creating, new, human, diseases, is, low, as, domesticated, pigs, have, been, in, close, contact, with, humans, for, thousands, of, years, pig, farms, can, serve, as, reservoirs, of, viral, diseases, that, are, dangerous, to, humans, and, so, contribute, to, their, outbreaks, in, human, populations, the, 2009, swine, flu, pandemic, was, caused, by, an, influenza, a, variant, which, had, first, emerged, in, pigs, pigs, were, also, essential, to, the, first, outbreak, of, the, nipah, virus, in, 1999, with, 93, of, the, infected, humans, having, had, contact, with, pigs, while, japanese, encephalitis, is, primarily, spread, by, mosquitoes, pigs, are, a, known, intermediary, host, there, is, also, a, potential, for, porcine, coronaviruses, such, as, porcine, epidemic, diarrhea, virus, or, swine, acute, diarrhea, syndrome, coronavirus, to, spill, over, into, human, populations, as, with, the, other, forms, of, meat, producing, pork, is, more, energy, intensive, than, plant, based, foods, and, it, is, associated, with, more, greenhouse, gas, emissions, per, calorie, however, emissions, from, pork, are, many, times, smaller, than, those, of, beef, veal, and, mutton, though, larger, than, of, chicken, meat, intensive, pig, production, is, also, associated, with, water, pollution, concerns, as, the, swine, waste, is, often, stored, above, ground, in, so, called, lagoons, these, lagoons, typically, have, high, levels, of, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, and, can, contain, toxic, heavy, metals, like, zinc, and, copper, microbial, pathogens, or, hold, elevated, concentrations, of, pharmaceuticals, from, subtherapeutic, antibiotic, use, in, swine, this, wastewater, from, lagoons, is, liable, to, reach, groundwater, on, farms, though, there, is, little, evidence, for, it, reaching, deeper, into, local, drinking, water, supplies, however, lagoon, spills, such, as, from, heavy, rains, in, the, wake, of, a, hurricane, can, lead, to, fish, kills, and, algal, blooms, in, local, rivers, in, the, united, states, 35, 000, mi, 56, 000, km, of, river, across, over, 20, states, were, estimated, to, have, been, contaminated, by, manure, leakage, as, of, 2015, there, is, also, evidence, that, evaporation, from, lagoons, can, cause, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, to, spread, through, the, air, as, dry, particles, then, reach, other, water, basins, when, they, fall, out, through, dry, deposition, this, process, then, also, contributes, to, water, eutrophication, intensive, pig, production, involves, practices, such, as, castration, earmarking, tattooing, for, litter, identification, tail, docking, which, are, often, done, without, the, use, of, anesthetic, painful, teeth, clipping, of, piglets, is, also, done, to, curtail, cannibalism, behavioural, instability, and, aggression, and, tail, biting, which, are, induced, by, the, cramped, environment, in, english, indoor, farming, young, pigs, less, than, 110kg, in, weight, are, allowed, to, be, kept, with, less, than, one, square, meter, of, space, per, pig, pigs, often, begin, life, in, a, farrowing, or, gestation, crate, which, is, a, small, pen, with, a, central, cage, designed, to, allow, the, piglets, to, feed, from, their, mother, while, preventing, her, from, attacking, or, crushing, them, the, crates, are, so, small, that, the, mother, sows, cannot, turn, around, while, wild, piglets, remain, with, their, mothers, for, around, 12, to, 14, weeks, farmed, piglets, are, weaned, and, removed, from, their, mothers, at, between, two, and, five, weeks, old, of, the, piglets, born, alive, 10, to, 18, will, not, reach, weaning, age, instead, succumbing, to, disease, starvation, dehydration, or, accidental, crushing, by, their, mothers, unusually, small, runt, piglets, are, typically, killed, immediately, by, staff, through, blunt, trauma, to, the, head, further, intensive, farming, involves, sows, giving, birth, to, large, litter, sizes, at, an, unnatural, frequency, which, increases, the, rate, of, stillborn, piglets, and, causes, as, many, as, 25, 50, of, sows, to, die, of, prolapse, pigs, widespread, in, societies, around, the, world, since, neolithic, times, have, been, used, for, many, purposes, in, art, literature, and, other, expressions, of, human, culture, in, classical, times, the, romans, considered, pork, the, finest, of, meats, enjoying, sausages, and, depicting, them, in, their, art, across, europe, pigs, have, been, celebrated, in, carnivals, since, the, middle, ages, becoming, specially, important, in, medieval, germany, in, cities, such, as, nuremberg, and, in, early, modern, italy, in, cities, such, as, bologna, pigs, especially, miniature, breeds, are, occasionally, kept, as, pets, in, literature, both, for, children, and, adults, pig, characters, appear, in, allegories, comic, stories, and, serious, novels, in, art, pigs, have, been, represented, in, a, wide, range, of, media, and, styles, from, the, earliest, times, in, many, cultures, pig, names, are, used, in, idioms, and, animal, epithets, often, derogatory, since, pigs, have, long, been, linked, with, dirtiness, and, greed, while, places, such, as, swindon, are, named, for, their, association, with, swine, the, eating, of, pork, is, forbidden, in, islam, and, judaism, but, pigs, are, sacred, in, some, other, religions
