extinction, is, the, termination, of, a, taxon, by, the, death, of, its, last, member, a, taxon, may, become, functionally, extinct, before, the, death, of, its, last, member, if, it, loses, the, capacity, to, reproduce, and, recover, because, a, species, potential, range, may, be, very, large, determining, this, moment, is, difficult, and, is, usually, done, retrospectively, this, difficulty, leads, to, phenomena, such, as, lazarus, taxa, where, a, species, presumed, extinct, abruptly, reappears, typically, in, the, fossil, record, after, a, period, of, apparent, absence, more, than, 99, of, all, species, that, ever, lived, on, earth, amounting, to, over, five, billion, species, are, estimated, to, have, died, out, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, currently, around, 8, 7, million, species, of, eukaryote, globally, and, possibly, many, times, more, if, microorganisms, like, bacteria, are, included, notable, extinct, animal, species, include, non, avian, dinosaurs, saber, toothed, cats, dodos, mammoths, ground, sloths, thylacines, trilobites, golden, toads, and, passenger, pigeons, through, evolution, species, arise, through, the, process, of, speciation, where, new, varieties, of, organisms, arise, and, thrive, when, they, are, able, to, find, and, exploit, an, ecological, niche, and, species, become, extinct, when, they, are, no, longer, able, to, survive, in, changing, conditions, or, against, superior, competition, the, relationship, between, animals, and, their, ecological, niches, has, been, firmly, established, a, typical, species, becomes, extinct, within, 10, million, years, of, its, first, appearance, although, some, species, called, living, fossils, survive, with, little, to, no, morphological, change, for, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, mass, extinctions, are, relatively, rare, events, however, isolated, extinctions, of, species, and, clades, are, quite, common, and, are, a, natural, part, of, the, evolutionary, process, only, recently, have, extinctions, been, recorded, and, scientists, have, become, alarmed, at, the, current, high, rate, of, extinctions, most, species, that, become, extinct, are, never, scientifically, documented, some, scientists, estimate, that, up, to, half, of, presently, existing, plant, and, animal, species, may, become, extinct, by, 2100, a, 2018, report, indicated, that, the, phylogenetic, diversity, of, 300, mammalian, species, erased, during, the, human, era, since, the, late, pleistocene, would, require, 5, to, 7, million, years, to, recover, according, to, the, 2019, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, by, ipbes, the, biomass, of, wild, mammals, has, fallen, by, 82, natural, ecosystems, have, lost, about, half, their, area, and, a, million, species, are, at, risk, of, extinction, all, largely, as, a, result, of, human, actions, twenty, five, percent, of, plant, and, animal, species, are, threatened, with, extinction, in, a, subsequent, report, ipbes, listed, unsustainable, fishing, hunting, and, logging, as, being, some, of, the, primary, drivers, of, the, global, extinction, crisis, in, june, 2019, one, million, species, of, plants, and, animals, were, at, risk, of, extinction, at, least, 571, plant, species, have, been, lost, since, 1750, but, likely, many, more, the, main, cause, of, the, extinctions, is, the, destruction, of, natural, habitats, by, human, activities, such, as, cutting, down, forests, and, converting, land, into, fields, for, farming, a, dagger, symbol, placed, next, to, the, name, of, a, species, or, other, taxon, normally, indicates, its, status, as, extinct, examples, of, species, and, subspecies, that, are, extinct, include, a, species, is, extinct, when, the, last, existing, member, dies, extinction, therefore, becomes, a, certainty, when, there, are, no, surviving, individuals, that, can, reproduce, and, create, a, new, generation, a, species, may, become, functionally, extinct, when, only, a, handful, of, individuals, survive, which, cannot, reproduce, due, to, poor, health, age, sparse, distribution, over, a, large, range, a, lack, of, individuals, of, both, sexes, in, sexually, reproducing, species, or, other, reasons, pinpointing, the, extinction, or, pseudoextinction, of, a, species, requires, a, clear, definition, of, that, species, if, it, is, to, be, declared, extinct, the, species, in, question, must, be, uniquely, distinguishable, from, any, ancestor, or, daughter, species, and, from, any, other, closely, related, species, extinction, of, a, species, or, replacement, by, a, daughter, species, plays, a, key, role, in, the, punctuated, equilibrium, hypothesis, of, stephen, jay, gould, and, niles, eldredge, in, ecology, extinction, is, sometimes, used, informally, to, refer, to, local, extinction, in, which, a, species, ceases, to, exist, in, the, chosen, area, of, study, despite, still, existing, elsewhere, local, extinctions, may, be, made, good, by, the, reintroduction, of, individuals, of, that, species, taken, from, other, locations, wolf, reintroduction, is, an, example, of, this, species, that, are, not, globally, extinct, are, termed, extant, those, species, that, are, extant, yet, are, threatened, with, extinction, are, referred, to, as, threatened, or, endangered, species, currently, an, important, aspect, of, extinction, is, human, attempts, to, preserve, critically, endangered, species, these, are, reflected, by, the, creation, of, the, conservation, status, extinct, in, the, wild, ew, species, listed, under, this, status, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, are, not, known, to, have, any, living, specimens, in, the, wild, and, are, maintained, only, in, zoos, or, other, artificial, environments, some, of, these, species, are, functionally, extinct, as, they, are, no, longer, part, of, their, natural, habitat, and, it, is, unlikely, the, species, will, ever, be, restored, to, the, wild, when, possible, modern, zoological, institutions, try, to, maintain, a, viable, population, for, species, preservation, and, possible, future, reintroduction, to, the, wild, through, use, of, carefully, planned, breeding, programs, the, extinction, of, one, species, wild, population, can, have, knock, on, effects, causing, further, extinctions, these, are, also, called, chains, of, extinction, this, is, especially, common, with, extinction, of, keystone, species, a, 2018, study, indicated, that, the, sixth, mass, extinction, started, in, the, late, pleistocene, could, take, up, to, 5, to, 7, million, years, to, restore, 2, 5, billion, years, of, unique, mammal, diversity, to, what, it, was, before, the, human, era, extinction, of, a, parent, species, where, daughter, species, or, subspecies, are, still, extant, is, called, pseudoextinction, or, phyletic, extinction, effectively, the, old, taxon, vanishes, transformed, anagenesis, into, a, successor, or, split, into, more, than, one, cladogenesis, pseudoextinction, is, difficult, to, demonstrate, unless, one, has, a, strong, chain, of, evidence, linking, a, living, species, to, members, of, a, pre, existing, species, for, example, it, is, sometimes, claimed, that, the, extinct, hyracotherium, which, was, an, early, horse, that, shares, a, common, ancestor, with, the, modern, horse, is, pseudoextinct, rather, than, extinct, because, there, are, several, extant, species, of, equus, including, zebra, and, donkey, however, as, fossil, species, typically, leave, no, genetic, material, behind, one, cannot, say, whether, hyracotherium, evolved, into, more, modern, horse, species, or, merely, evolved, from, a, common, ancestor, with, modern, horses, pseudoextinction, is, much, easier, to, demonstrate, for, larger, taxonomic, groups, a, lazarus, taxon, or, lazarus, species, refers, to, instances, where, a, species, or, taxon, was, thought, to, be, extinct, but, was, later, rediscovered, it, can, also, refer, to, instances, where, large, gaps, in, the, fossil, record, of, a, taxon, result, in, fossils, reappearing, much, later, although, the, taxon, may, have, ultimately, become, extinct, at, a, later, point, the, coelacanth, a, fish, related, to, lungfish, and, tetrapods, is, an, example, of, a, lazarus, taxon, that, was, known, only, from, the, fossil, record, and, was, considered, to, have, been, extinct, since, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, in, 1938, however, a, living, specimen, was, found, off, the, chalumna, river, now, tyolomnqa, on, the, east, coast, of, south, africa, calliostoma, bullatum, a, species, of, deepwater, sea, snail, originally, described, from, fossils, in, 1844, proved, to, be, a, lazarus, species, when, extant, individuals, were, described, in, 2019, attenborough, s, long, beaked, echidna, zaglossus, attenboroughi, is, an, example, of, a, lazarus, species, from, papua, new, guinea, that, had, last, been, sighted, in, 1962, and, believed, to, be, possibly, extinct, until, it, was, recorded, again, in, november, 2023, some, species, currently, thought, to, be, extinct, have, had, continued, speculation, that, they, may, still, exist, and, in, the, event, of, rediscovery, would, be, considered, lazarus, species, examples, include, the, thylacine, or, tasmanian, tiger, thylacinus, cynocephalus, the, last, known, example, of, which, died, in, hobart, zoo, in, tasmania, in, 1936, the, japanese, wolf, canis, lupus, hodophilax, last, sighted, over, 100, years, ago, the, american, ivory, billed, woodpecker, campephilus, principalis, with, the, last, universally, accepted, sighting, in, 1944, and, the, slender, billed, curlew, numenius, tenuirostris, not, seen, since, 2007, as, long, as, species, have, been, evolving, species, have, been, going, extinct, it, is, estimated, that, over, 99, 9, of, all, species, that, ever, lived, are, extinct, the, average, lifespan, of, a, species, is, 1, 10, million, years, although, this, varies, widely, between, taxa, a, variety, of, causes, can, contribute, directly, or, indirectly, to, the, extinction, of, a, species, or, group, of, species, just, as, each, species, is, unique, write, beverly, and, stephen, c, stearns, so, is, each, extinction, the, causes, for, each, are, varied, some, subtle, and, complex, others, obvious, and, simple, most, simply, any, species, that, cannot, survive, and, reproduce, in, its, environment, and, cannot, move, to, a, new, environment, where, it, can, do, so, dies, out, and, becomes, extinct, extinction, of, a, species, may, come, suddenly, when, an, otherwise, healthy, species, is, wiped, out, completely, as, when, toxic, pollution, renders, its, entire, habitat, unliveable, or, may, occur, gradually, over, thousands, or, millions, of, years, such, as, when, a, species, gradually, loses, out, in, competition, for, food, to, better, adapted, competitors, extinction, may, occur, a, long, time, after, the, events, that, set, it, in, motion, a, phenomenon, known, as, extinction, debt, assessing, the, relative, importance, of, genetic, factors, compared, to, environmental, ones, as, the, causes, of, extinction, has, been, compared, to, the, debate, on, nature, and, nurture, the, question, of, whether, more, extinctions, in, the, fossil, record, have, been, caused, by, evolution, or, by, competition, or, by, predation, or, by, disease, or, by, catastrophe, is, a, subject, of, discussion, mark, newman, the, author, of, modeling, extinction, argues, for, a, mathematical, model, that, falls, in, all, positions, by, contrast, conservation, biology, uses, the, extinction, vortex, model, to, classify, extinctions, by, cause, when, concerns, about, human, extinction, have, been, raised, for, example, in, sir, martin, rees, 2003, book, our, final, hour, those, concerns, lie, with, the, effects, of, climate, change, or, technological, disaster, human, driven, extinction, started, as, humans, migrated, out, of, africa, more, than, 60, 000, years, ago, currently, environmental, groups, and, some, governments, are, concerned, with, the, extinction, of, species, caused, by, humanity, and, they, try, to, prevent, further, extinctions, through, a, variety, of, conservation, programs, humans, can, cause, extinction, of, a, species, through, overharvesting, pollution, habitat, destruction, introduction, of, invasive, species, such, as, new, predators, and, food, competitors, overhunting, and, other, influences, explosive, unsustainable, human, population, growth, and, increasing, per, capita, consumption, are, essential, drivers, of, the, extinction, crisis, according, to, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, 784, extinctions, have, been, recorded, since, the, year, 1500, the, arbitrary, date, selected, to, define, recent, extinctions, up, to, the, year, 2004, with, many, more, likely, to, have, gone, unnoticed, several, species, have, also, been, listed, as, extinct, since, 2004, if, adaptation, increasing, population, fitness, is, slower, than, environmental, degradation, plus, the, accumulation, of, slightly, deleterious, mutations, then, a, population, will, go, extinct, smaller, populations, have, fewer, beneficial, mutations, entering, the, population, each, generation, slowing, adaptation, it, is, also, easier, for, slightly, deleterious, mutations, to, fix, in, small, populations, the, resulting, positive, feedback, loop, between, small, population, size, and, low, fitness, can, cause, mutational, meltdown, limited, geographic, range, is, the, most, important, determinant, of, genus, extinction, at, background, rates, but, becomes, increasingly, irrelevant, as, mass, extinction, arises, limited, geographic, range, is, a, cause, both, of, small, population, size, and, of, greater, vulnerability, to, local, environmental, catastrophes, extinction, rates, can, be, affected, not, just, by, population, size, but, by, any, factor, that, affects, evolvability, including, balancing, selection, cryptic, genetic, variation, phenotypic, plasticity, and, robustness, a, diverse, or, deep, gene, pool, gives, a, population, a, higher, chance, in, the, short, term, of, surviving, an, adverse, change, in, conditions, effects, that, cause, or, reward, a, loss, in, genetic, diversity, can, increase, the, chances, of, extinction, of, a, species, population, bottlenecks, can, dramatically, reduce, genetic, diversity, by, severely, limiting, the, number, of, reproducing, individuals, and, make, inbreeding, more, frequent, extinction, sometimes, results, for, species, evolved, to, specific, ecologies, that, are, subjected, to, genetic, pollution, i, e, uncontrolled, hybridization, introgression, and, genetic, swamping, that, lead, to, homogenization, or, out, competition, from, the, introduced, or, hybrid, species, endemic, populations, can, face, such, extinctions, when, new, populations, are, imported, or, selectively, bred, by, people, or, when, habitat, modification, brings, previously, isolated, species, into, contact, extinction, is, likeliest, for, rare, species, coming, into, contact, with, more, abundant, ones, interbreeding, can, swamp, the, rarer, gene, pool, and, create, hybrids, depleting, the, purebred, gene, pool, for, example, the, endangered, wild, water, buffalo, is, most, threatened, with, extinction, by, genetic, pollution, from, the, abundant, domestic, water, buffalo, such, extinctions, are, not, always, apparent, from, morphological, non, genetic, observations, some, degree, of, gene, flow, is, a, normal, evolutionary, process, nevertheless, hybridization, with, or, without, introgression, threatens, rare, species, existence, the, gene, pool, of, a, species, or, a, population, is, the, variety, of, genetic, information, in, its, living, members, a, large, gene, pool, extensive, genetic, diversity, is, associated, with, robust, populations, that, can, survive, bouts, of, intense, selection, meanwhile, low, genetic, diversity, see, inbreeding, and, population, bottlenecks, reduces, the, range, of, adaptions, possible, replacing, native, with, alien, genes, narrows, genetic, diversity, within, the, original, population, thereby, increasing, the, chance, of, extinction, habitat, degradation, is, currently, the, main, anthropogenic, cause, of, species, extinctions, the, main, cause, of, habitat, degradation, worldwide, is, agriculture, with, urban, sprawl, logging, mining, and, some, fishing, practices, close, behind, the, degradation, of, a, species, habitat, may, alter, the, fitness, landscape, to, such, an, extent, that, the, species, is, no, longer, able, to, survive, and, becomes, extinct, this, may, occur, by, direct, effects, such, as, the, environment, becoming, toxic, or, indirectly, by, limiting, a, species, ability, to, compete, effectively, for, diminished, resources, or, against, new, competitor, species, habitat, destruction, particularly, the, removal, of, vegetation, that, stabilizes, soil, enhances, erosion, and, diminishes, nutrient, availability, in, terrestrial, ecosystems, this, degradation, can, lead, to, a, reduction, in, agricultural, productivity, furthermore, increased, erosion, contributes, to, poorer, water, quality, by, elevating, the, levels, of, sediment, and, pollutants, in, rivers, and, streams, habitat, degradation, through, toxicity, can, kill, off, a, species, very, rapidly, by, killing, all, living, members, through, contamination, or, sterilizing, them, it, can, also, occur, over, longer, periods, at, lower, toxicity, levels, by, affecting, life, span, reproductive, capacity, or, competitiveness, habitat, degradation, can, also, take, the, form, of, a, physical, destruction, of, niche, habitats, the, widespread, destruction, of, tropical, rainforests, and, replacement, with, open, pastureland, is, widely, cited, as, an, example, of, this, elimination, of, the, dense, forest, eliminated, the, infrastructure, needed, by, many, species, to, survive, for, example, a, fern, that, depends, on, dense, shade, for, protection, from, direct, sunlight, can, no, longer, survive, without, forest, to, shelter, it, another, example, is, the, destruction, of, ocean, floors, by, bottom, trawling, diminished, resources, or, introduction, of, new, competitor, species, also, often, accompany, habitat, degradation, global, warming, has, allowed, some, species, to, expand, their, range, bringing, competition, to, other, species, that, previously, occupied, that, area, sometimes, these, new, competitors, are, predators, and, directly, affect, prey, species, while, at, other, times, they, may, merely, outcompete, vulnerable, species, for, limited, resources, vital, resources, including, water, and, food, can, also, be, limited, during, habitat, degradation, leading, to, extinction, in, the, natural, course, of, events, species, become, extinct, for, a, number, of, reasons, including, but, not, limited, to, extinction, of, a, necessary, host, prey, or, pollinator, interspecific, competition, inability, to, deal, with, evolving, diseases, and, changing, environmental, conditions, particularly, sudden, changes, which, can, act, to, introduce, novel, predators, or, to, remove, prey, recently, in, geological, time, humans, have, become, an, additional, cause, of, extinction, of, some, species, either, as, a, new, mega, predator, or, by, transporting, animals, and, plants, from, one, part, of, the, world, to, another, such, introductions, have, been, occurring, for, thousands, of, years, sometimes, intentionally, e, g, livestock, released, by, sailors, on, islands, as, a, future, source, of, food, and, sometimes, accidentally, e, g, rats, escaping, from, boats, in, most, cases, the, introductions, are, unsuccessful, but, when, an, invasive, alien, species, does, become, established, the, consequences, can, be, catastrophic, invasive, alien, species, can, affect, native, species, directly, by, eating, them, competing, with, them, and, introducing, pathogens, or, parasites, that, sicken, or, kill, them, or, indirectly, by, destroying, or, degrading, their, habitat, human, populations, may, themselves, act, as, invasive, predators, according, to, the, overkill, hypothesis, the, swift, extinction, of, the, megafauna, in, areas, such, as, australia, 40, 000, years, before, present, north, and, south, america, 12, 000, years, before, present, madagascar, hawaii, ad, 300, 1000, and, new, zealand, ad, 1300, 1500, resulted, from, the, sudden, introduction, of, human, beings, to, environments, full, of, animals, that, had, never, seen, them, before, and, were, therefore, completely, unadapted, to, their, predation, techniques, coextinction, refers, to, the, loss, of, a, species, due, to, the, extinction, of, another, for, example, the, extinction, of, parasitic, insects, following, the, loss, of, their, hosts, coextinction, can, also, occur, when, a, species, loses, its, pollinator, or, to, predators, in, a, food, chain, who, lose, their, prey, species, coextinction, is, a, manifestation, of, one, of, the, interconnectednesses, of, organisms, in, complex, ecosystems, while, coextinction, may, not, be, the, most, important, cause, of, species, extinctions, it, is, certainly, an, insidious, one, coextinction, is, especially, common, when, a, keystone, species, goes, extinct, models, suggest, that, coextinction, is, the, most, common, form, of, biodiversity, loss, there, may, be, a, cascade, of, coextinction, across, the, trophic, levels, such, effects, are, most, severe, in, mutualistic, and, parasitic, relationships, an, example, of, coextinction, is, the, haast, s, eagle, and, the, moa, the, haast, s, eagle, was, a, predator, that, became, extinct, because, its, food, source, became, extinct, the, moa, were, several, species, of, flightless, birds, that, were, a, food, source, for, the, haast, s, eagle, extinction, as, a, result, of, climate, change, has, been, confirmed, by, fossil, studies, particularly, the, extinction, of, amphibians, during, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, 305, million, years, ago, a, 2003, review, across, 14, biodiversity, research, centers, predicted, that, because, of, climate, change, 15, 37, of, land, species, would, be, committed, to, extinction, by, 2050, the, ecologically, rich, areas, that, would, potentially, suffer, the, heaviest, losses, include, the, cape, floristic, region, and, the, caribbean, basin, these, areas, might, see, a, doubling, of, present, carbon, dioxide, levels, and, rising, temperatures, that, could, eliminate, 56, 000, plant, and, 3, 700, animal, species, climate, change, has, also, been, found, to, be, a, factor, in, habitat, loss, and, desertification, studies, of, fossils, following, species, from, the, time, they, evolved, to, their, extinction, show, that, species, with, high, sexual, dimorphism, especially, characteristics, in, males, that, are, used, to, compete, for, mating, are, at, a, higher, risk, of, extinction, and, die, out, faster, than, less, sexually, dimorphic, species, the, least, sexually, dimorphic, species, surviving, for, millions, of, years, while, the, most, sexually, dimorphic, species, die, out, within, mere, thousands, of, years, earlier, studies, based, on, counting, the, number, of, currently, living, species, in, modern, taxa, have, shown, a, higher, number, of, species, in, more, sexually, dimorphic, taxa, which, have, been, interpreted, as, higher, survival, in, taxa, with, more, sexual, selection, but, such, studies, of, modern, species, only, measure, indirect, effects, of, extinction, and, are, subject, to, error, sources, such, as, dying, and, doomed, taxa, speciating, more, due, to, splitting, of, habitat, ranges, into, more, small, isolated, groups, during, the, habitat, retreat, of, taxa, approaching, extinction, possible, causes, of, the, higher, extinction, risk, in, species, with, more, sexual, selection, shown, by, the, comprehensive, fossil, studies, that, rule, out, such, error, sources, include, expensive, sexually, selected, ornaments, having, negative, effects, on, the, ability, to, survive, natural, selection, as, well, as, sexual, selection, removing, a, diversity, of, genes, that, under, current, ecological, conditions, are, neutral, for, natural, selection, but, some, of, which, may, be, important, for, surviving, climate, change, there, have, been, at, least, five, mass, extinctions, in, the, history, of, life, on, earth, and, four, in, the, last, 350, million, years, in, which, many, species, have, disappeared, in, a, relatively, short, period, of, geological, time, a, massive, eruptive, event, that, released, large, quantities, of, tephra, particles, into, the, atmosphere, is, considered, to, be, one, likely, cause, of, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, about, 250, million, years, ago, which, is, estimated, to, have, killed, 90, of, species, then, existing, there, is, also, evidence, to, suggest, that, this, event, was, preceded, by, another, mass, extinction, known, as, olson, s, extinction, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, k, pg, occurred, 66, million, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, it, is, best, known, for, having, wiped, out, non, avian, dinosaurs, among, many, other, species, according, to, a, 1998, survey, of, 400, biologists, conducted, by, new, york, s, american, museum, of, natural, history, nearly, 70, believed, that, the, earth, is, currently, in, the, early, stages, of, a, human, caused, mass, extinction, known, as, the, holocene, extinction, in, that, survey, the, same, proportion, of, respondents, agreed, with, the, prediction, that, up, to, 20, of, all, living, populations, could, become, extinct, within, 30, years, by, 2028, a, 2014, special, edition, of, science, declared, there, is, widespread, consensus, on, the, issue, of, human, driven, mass, species, extinctions, a, 2020, study, published, in, pnas, stated, that, the, contemporary, extinction, crisis, may, be, the, most, serious, environmental, threat, to, the, persistence, of, civilization, because, it, is, irreversible, biologist, e, o, wilson, estimated, in, 2002, that, if, current, rates, of, human, destruction, of, the, biosphere, continue, one, half, of, all, plant, and, animal, species, of, life, on, earth, will, be, extinct, in, 100, years, more, significantly, the, current, rate, of, global, species, extinctions, is, estimated, as, 100, to, 1, 000, times, background, rates, the, average, extinction, rates, in, the, evolutionary, time, scale, of, planet, earth, faster, than, at, any, other, time, in, human, history, while, future, rates, are, likely, 10, 000, times, higher, however, some, groups, are, going, extinct, much, faster, biologists, paul, r, ehrlich, and, stuart, pimm, among, others, contend, that, human, population, growth, and, overconsumption, are, the, main, drivers, of, the, modern, extinction, crisis, in, january, 2020, the, un, s, convention, on, biological, diversity, drafted, a, plan, to, mitigate, the, contemporary, extinction, crisis, by, establishing, a, deadline, of, 2030, to, protect, 30, of, the, earth, s, land, and, oceans, and, reduce, pollution, by, 50, with, the, goal, of, allowing, for, the, restoration, of, ecosystems, by, 2050, the, 2020, united, nations, global, biodiversity, outlook, report, stated, that, of, the, 20, biodiversity, goals, laid, out, by, the, aichi, biodiversity, targets, in, 2010, only, 6, were, partially, achieved, by, the, deadline, of, 2020, the, report, warned, that, biodiversity, will, continue, to, decline, if, the, status, quo, is, not, changed, in, particular, the, currently, unsustainable, patterns, of, production, and, consumption, population, growth, and, technological, developments, in, a, 2021, report, published, in, the, journal, frontiers, in, conservation, science, some, top, scientists, asserted, that, even, if, the, aichi, biodiversity, targets, set, for, 2020, had, been, achieved, it, would, not, have, resulted, in, a, significant, mitigation, of, biodiversity, loss, they, added, that, failure, of, the, global, community, to, reach, these, targets, is, hardly, surprising, given, that, biodiversity, loss, is, nowhere, close, to, the, top, of, any, country, s, priorities, trailing, far, behind, other, concerns, such, as, employment, healthcare, economic, growth, or, currency, stability, for, much, of, history, the, modern, understanding, of, extinction, as, the, end, of, a, species, was, incompatible, with, the, prevailing, worldview, prior, to, the, 19th, century, much, of, western, society, adhered, to, the, belief, that, the, world, was, created, by, god, and, as, such, was, complete, and, perfect, this, concept, reached, its, heyday, in, the, 1700s, with, the, peak, popularity, of, a, theological, concept, called, the, great, chain, of, being, in, which, all, life, on, earth, from, the, tiniest, microorganism, to, god, is, linked, in, a, continuous, chain, the, extinction, of, a, species, was, impossible, under, this, model, as, it, would, create, gaps, or, missing, links, in, the, chain, and, destroy, the, natural, order, thomas, jefferson, was, a, firm, supporter, of, the, great, chain, of, being, and, an, opponent, of, extinction, famously, denying, the, extinction, of, the, woolly, mammoth, on, the, grounds, that, nature, never, allows, a, race, of, animals, to, become, extinct, a, series, of, fossils, were, discovered, in, the, late, 17th, century, that, appeared, unlike, any, living, species, as, a, result, the, scientific, community, embarked, on, a, voyage, of, creative, rationalization, seeking, to, understand, what, had, happened, to, these, species, within, a, framework, that, did, not, account, for, total, extinction, in, october, 1686, robert, hooke, presented, an, impression, of, a, nautilus, to, the, royal, society, that, was, more, than, two, feet, in, diameter, and, morphologically, distinct, from, any, known, living, species, hooke, theorized, that, this, was, simply, because, the, species, lived, in, the, deep, ocean, and, no, one, had, discovered, them, yet, while, he, contended, that, it, was, possible, a, species, could, be, lost, he, thought, this, highly, unlikely, similarly, in, 1695, sir, thomas, molyneux, published, an, account, of, enormous, antlers, found, in, ireland, that, did, not, belong, to, any, extant, taxa, in, that, area, molyneux, reasoned, that, they, came, from, the, north, american, moose, and, that, the, animal, had, once, been, common, on, the, british, isles, rather, than, suggest, that, this, indicated, the, possibility, of, species, going, extinct, he, argued, that, although, organisms, could, become, locally, extinct, they, could, never, be, entirely, lost, and, would, continue, to, exist, in, some, unknown, region, of, the, globe, the, antlers, were, later, confirmed, to, be, from, the, extinct, deer, megaloceros, hooke, and, molyneux, s, line, of, thinking, was, difficult, to, disprove, when, parts, of, the, world, had, not, been, thoroughly, examined, and, charted, scientists, could, not, rule, out, that, animals, found, only, in, the, fossil, record, were, not, simply, hiding, in, unexplored, regions, of, the, earth, georges, cuvier, is, credited, with, establishing, the, modern, conception, of, extinction, in, a, 1796, lecture, to, the, french, institute, though, he, would, spend, most, of, his, career, trying, to, convince, the, wider, scientific, community, of, his, theory, cuvier, was, a, well, regarded, geologist, lauded, for, his, ability, to, reconstruct, the, anatomy, of, an, unknown, species, from, a, few, fragments, of, bone, his, primary, evidence, for, extinction, came, from, mammoth, skulls, found, in, the, paris, basin, cuvier, recognized, them, as, distinct, from, any, known, living, species, of, elephant, and, argued, that, it, was, highly, unlikely, such, an, enormous, animal, would, go, undiscovered, in, 1812, cuvier, along, with, alexandre, brongniart, and, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, mapped, the, strata, of, the, paris, basin, they, saw, alternating, saltwater, and, freshwater, deposits, as, well, as, patterns, of, the, appearance, and, disappearance, of, fossils, throughout, the, record, from, these, patterns, cuvier, inferred, historic, cycles, of, catastrophic, flooding, extinction, and, repopulation, of, the, earth, with, new, species, cuvier, s, fossil, evidence, showed, that, very, different, life, forms, existed, in, the, past, than, those, that, exist, today, a, fact, that, was, accepted, by, most, scientists, the, primary, debate, focused, on, whether, this, turnover, caused, by, extinction, was, gradual, or, abrupt, in, nature, cuvier, understood, extinction, to, be, the, result, of, cataclysmic, events, that, wipe, out, huge, numbers, of, species, as, opposed, to, the, gradual, decline, of, a, species, over, time, his, catastrophic, view, of, the, nature, of, extinction, garnered, him, many, opponents, in, the, newly, emerging, school, of, uniformitarianism, jean, baptiste, lamarck, a, gradualist, and, colleague, of, cuvier, saw, the, fossils, of, different, life, forms, as, evidence, of, the, mutable, character, of, species, while, lamarck, did, not, deny, the, possibility, of, extinction, he, believed, that, it, was, exceptional, and, rare, and, that, most, of, the, change, in, species, over, time, was, due, to, gradual, change, unlike, cuvier, lamarck, was, skeptical, that, catastrophic, events, of, a, scale, large, enough, to, cause, total, extinction, were, possible, in, his, geological, history, of, the, earth, titled, hydrogeologie, lamarck, instead, argued, that, the, surface, of, the, earth, was, shaped, by, gradual, erosion, and, deposition, by, water, and, that, species, changed, over, time, in, response, to, the, changing, environment, charles, lyell, a, noted, geologist, and, founder, of, uniformitarianism, believed, that, past, processes, should, be, understood, using, present, day, processes, like, lamarck, lyell, acknowledged, that, extinction, could, occur, noting, the, total, extinction, of, the, dodo, and, the, extirpation, of, indigenous, horses, to, the, british, isles, he, similarly, argued, against, mass, extinctions, believing, that, any, extinction, must, be, a, gradual, process, lyell, also, showed, that, cuvier, s, original, interpretation, of, the, parisian, strata, was, incorrect, instead, of, the, catastrophic, floods, inferred, by, cuvier, lyell, demonstrated, that, patterns, of, saltwater, and, freshwater, deposits, like, those, seen, in, the, paris, basin, could, be, formed, by, a, slow, rise, and, fall, of, sea, levels, the, concept, of, extinction, was, integral, to, charles, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, with, less, fit, lineages, disappearing, over, time, for, darwin, extinction, was, a, constant, side, effect, of, competition, because, of, the, wide, reach, of, on, the, origin, of, species, it, was, widely, accepted, that, extinction, occurred, gradually, and, evenly, a, concept, now, referred, to, as, background, extinction, it, was, not, until, 1982, when, david, raup, and, jack, sepkoski, published, their, seminal, paper, on, mass, extinctions, that, cuvier, was, vindicated, and, catastrophic, extinction, was, accepted, as, an, important, mechanism, the, current, understanding, of, extinction, is, a, synthesis, of, the, cataclysmic, extinction, events, proposed, by, cuvier, and, the, background, extinction, events, proposed, by, lyell, and, darwin, extinction, is, an, important, research, topic, in, the, field, of, zoology, and, biology, in, general, and, has, also, become, an, area, of, concern, outside, the, scientific, community, a, number, of, organizations, such, as, the, worldwide, fund, for, nature, have, been, created, with, the, goal, of, preserving, species, from, extinction, governments, have, attempted, through, enacting, laws, to, avoid, habitat, destruction, agricultural, over, harvesting, and, pollution, while, many, human, caused, extinctions, have, been, accidental, humans, have, also, engaged, in, the, deliberate, destruction, of, some, species, such, as, dangerous, viruses, and, the, total, destruction, of, other, problematic, species, has, been, suggested, other, species, were, deliberately, driven, to, extinction, or, nearly, so, due, to, poaching, or, because, they, were, undesirable, or, to, push, for, other, human, agendas, one, example, was, the, near, extinction, of, the, american, bison, which, was, nearly, wiped, out, by, mass, hunts, sanctioned, by, the, united, states, government, to, force, the, removal, of, native, americans, many, of, whom, relied, on, the, bison, for, food, biologist, bruce, walsh, states, three, reasons, for, scientific, interest, in, the, preservation, of, species, genetic, resources, ecosystem, stability, and, ethics, and, today, the, scientific, community, stress, the, importance, of, maintaining, biodiversity, in, modern, times, commercial, and, industrial, interests, often, have, to, contend, with, the, effects, of, production, on, plant, and, animal, life, however, some, technologies, with, minimal, or, no, proven, harmful, effects, on, homo, sapiens, can, be, devastating, to, wildlife, for, example, ddt, biogeographer, jared, diamond, notes, that, while, big, business, may, label, environmental, concerns, as, exaggerated, and, often, cause, devastating, damage, some, corporations, find, it, in, their, interest, to, adopt, good, conservation, practices, and, even, engage, in, preservation, efforts, that, surpass, those, taken, by, national, parks, governments, sometimes, see, the, loss, of, native, species, as, a, loss, to, ecotourism, and, can, enact, laws, with, severe, punishment, against, the, trade, in, native, species, in, an, effort, to, prevent, extinction, in, the, wild, nature, preserves, are, created, by, governments, as, a, means, to, provide, continuing, habitats, to, species, crowded, by, human, expansion, the, 1992, convention, on, biological, diversity, has, resulted, in, international, biodiversity, action, plan, programmes, which, attempt, to, provide, comprehensive, guidelines, for, government, biodiversity, conservation, advocacy, groups, such, as, the, wildlands, project, and, the, alliance, for, zero, extinctions, work, to, educate, the, public, and, pressure, governments, into, action, people, who, live, close, to, nature, can, be, dependent, on, the, survival, of, all, the, species, in, their, environment, leaving, them, highly, exposed, to, extinction, risks, however, people, prioritize, day, to, day, survival, over, species, conservation, with, human, overpopulation, in, tropical, developing, countries, there, has, been, enormous, pressure, on, forests, due, to, subsistence, agriculture, including, slash, and, burn, agricultural, techniques, that, can, reduce, endangered, species, s, habitats, antinatalist, philosopher, david, benatar, concludes, that, any, popular, concern, about, non, human, species, extinction, usually, arises, out, of, concern, about, how, the, loss, of, a, species, will, impact, human, wants, and, needs, that, we, shall, live, in, a, world, impoverished, by, the, loss, of, one, aspect, of, faunal, diversity, that, we, shall, no, longer, be, able, to, behold, or, use, that, species, of, animal, he, notes, that, typical, concerns, about, possible, human, extinction, such, as, the, loss, of, individual, members, are, not, considered, in, regards, to, non, human, species, extinction, anthropologist, jason, hickel, speculates, that, the, reason, humanity, seems, largely, indifferent, to, anthropogenic, mass, species, extinction, is, that, we, see, ourselves, as, separate, from, the, natural, world, and, the, organisms, within, it, he, says, that, this, is, due, in, part, to, the, logic, of, capitalism, that, the, world, is, not, really, alive, and, it, is, certainly, not, our, kin, but, rather, just, stuff, to, be, extracted, and, discarded, and, that, includes, most, of, the, human, beings, living, here, too, the, poliovirus, is, now, confined, to, small, parts, of, the, world, due, to, extermination, efforts, dracunculus, medinensis, or, guinea, worm, a, parasitic, worm, which, causes, the, disease, dracunculiasis, is, now, close, to, eradication, thanks, to, efforts, led, by, the, carter, center, treponema, pallidum, pertenue, a, bacterium, which, causes, the, disease, yaws, is, in, the, process, of, being, eradicated, biologist, olivia, judson, has, advocated, the, deliberate, extinction, of, certain, disease, carrying, mosquito, species, in, a, september, 25, 2003, article, in, the, new, york, times, she, advocated, specicide, of, thirty, mosquito, species, by, introducing, a, genetic, element, that, can, insert, itself, into, another, crucial, gene, to, create, recessive, knockout, genes, she, says, that, the, anopheles, mosquitoes, which, spread, malaria, and, aedes, mosquitoes, which, spread, dengue, fever, yellow, fever, elephantiasis, and, other, diseases, represent, only, 30, of, around, 3, 500, mosquito, species, eradicating, these, would, save, at, least, one, million, human, lives, per, year, at, a, cost, of, reducing, the, genetic, diversity, of, the, family, culicidae, by, only, 1, she, further, argues, that, since, species, become, extinct, all, the, time, the, disappearance, of, a, few, more, will, not, destroy, the, ecosystem, we, re, not, left, with, a, wasteland, every, time, a, species, vanishes, removing, one, species, sometimes, causes, shifts, in, the, populations, of, other, species, but, different, need, not, mean, worse, in, addition, anti, malarial, and, mosquito, control, programs, offer, little, realistic, hope, to, the, 300, million, people, in, developing, nations, who, will, be, infected, with, acute, illnesses, this, year, although, trials, are, ongoing, she, writes, that, if, they, fail, we, should, consider, the, ultimate, swatting, biologist, e, o, wilson, has, advocated, the, eradication, of, several, species, of, mosquito, including, malaria, vector, anopheles, gambiae, wilson, stated, i, m, talking, about, a, very, small, number, of, species, that, have, co, evolved, with, us, and, are, preying, on, humans, so, it, would, certainly, be, acceptable, to, remove, them, i, believe, it, s, just, common, sense, there, have, been, many, campaigns, some, successful, to, locally, eradicate, tsetse, flies, and, their, trypanosomes, in, areas, countries, and, islands, of, africa, including, pr, ncipe, there, are, currently, serious, efforts, to, do, away, with, them, all, across, africa, and, this, is, generally, viewed, as, beneficial, and, morally, necessary, although, not, always, some, such, as, harvard, geneticist, george, m, church, believe, that, ongoing, technological, advances, will, let, us, bring, back, to, life, an, extinct, species, by, cloning, using, dna, from, the, remains, of, that, species, proposed, targets, for, cloning, include, the, mammoth, the, thylacine, and, the, pyrenean, ibex, for, this, to, succeed, enough, individuals, would, have, to, be, cloned, from, the, dna, of, different, individuals, in, the, case, of, sexually, reproducing, organisms, to, create, a, viable, population, though, bioethical, and, philosophical, objections, have, been, raised, the, cloning, of, extinct, creatures, seems, theoretically, possible, in, 2003, scientists, tried, to, clone, the, extinct, pyrenean, ibex, c, p, pyrenaica, this, attempt, failed, of, the, 285, embryos, reconstructed, 54, were, transferred, to, 12, spanish, ibexes, and, ibex, domestic, goat, hybrids, but, only, two, survived, the, initial, two, months, of, gestation, before, they, too, died, in, 2009, a, second, attempt, was, made, to, clone, the, pyrenean, ibex, one, clone, was, born, alive, but, died, seven, minutes, later, due, to, physical, defects, in, the, lungs
