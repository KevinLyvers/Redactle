hoopoes, h, u, p, u, h, u, p, o, are, colourful, birds, found, across, africa, asia, and, europe, notable, for, their, distinctive, crown, of, feathers, which, can, be, raised, or, lowered, at, will, three, living, and, one, extinct, species, are, recognized, though, for, many, years, all, of, the, extant, species, were, lumped, as, a, single, species, upupa, epops, in, fact, some, taxonomists, still, consider, all, three, species, conspecific, some, authorities, also, keep, the, african, and, eurasian, hoopoe, together, but, split, the, madagascar, hoopoe, the, eurasian, hoopoe, is, common, in, its, range, and, has, a, large, population, so, it, is, evaluated, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, however, their, numbers, are, declining, in, western, europe, conversely, the, hoopoe, has, been, increasing, in, numbers, at, the, tip, of, the, south, sinai, sharm, el, sheikh, there, are, dozens, of, nesting, pairs, that, remain, resident, all, year, round, the, genus, upupa, was, introduced, in, 1758, by, the, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, in, the, tenth, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, the, type, species, is, the, eurasian, hoopoe, upupa, epops, upupa, and, epops, are, respectively, the, latin, and, ancient, greek, names, for, the, hoopoe, both, like, the, english, name, are, onomatopoeic, forms, which, imitate, the, cry, of, the, bird, the, hoopoe, was, classified, in, the, clade, coraciiformes, which, also, includes, kingfishers, bee, eaters, and, rollers, a, close, relationship, between, the, hoopoe, and, the, wood, hoopoes, is, also, supported, by, the, shared, and, unique, nature, of, their, stapes, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, the, hoopoe, is, separated, from, the, coraciiformes, as, a, separate, order, the, upupiformes, some, authorities, place, the, wood, hoopoes, in, the, upupiformes, as, well, now, the, consensus, is, that, both, hoopoe, and, the, wood, hoopoes, belong, with, the, hornbills, in, the, bucerotiformes, the, fossil, record, of, the, hoopoes, is, very, incomplete, with, the, earliest, fossil, coming, from, the, quaternary, the, fossil, record, of, their, relatives, is, older, with, fossil, wood, hoopoes, dating, back, to, the, miocene, and, those, of, an, extinct, related, family, the, messelirrisoridae, dating, from, the, eocene, formerly, considered, a, single, species, the, hoopoe, has, been, split, into, three, separate, species, the, eurasian, hoopoe, madagascar, hoopoe, and, the, resident, african, hoopoe, one, accepted, separate, species, the, saint, helena, hoopoe, lived, on, the, island, of, st, helena, but, became, extinct, in, the, 16th, century, presumably, due, to, introduced, species, the, genus, upupa, was, created, by, linnaeus, in, his, systema, naturae, in, 1758, it, then, included, three, other, species, with, long, curved, bills, formerly, the, greater, hoopoe, lark, was, also, considered, to, be, a, member, of, this, genus, as, upupa, alaudipes, hoopoes, are, widespread, in, europe, asia, and, north, africa, sub, saharan, africa, and, madagascar, most, european, and, north, asian, birds, migrate, to, the, tropics, in, winter, in, contrast, the, african, populations, are, sedentary, all, year, the, species, has, been, a, vagrant, in, alaska, u, e, saturata, was, recorded, there, in, 1975, in, the, yukon, delta, hoopoes, have, been, known, to, breed, north, of, their, european, range, and, in, southern, england, during, warm, dry, summers, that, provide, plenty, of, grasshoppers, and, similar, insects, although, as, of, the, early, 1980s, northern, european, populations, were, reported, to, be, in, the, decline, possibly, due, to, changes, in, climate, the, hoopoe, has, two, basic, requirements, of, its, habitat, bare, or, lightly, vegetated, ground, on, which, to, forage, and, vertical, surfaces, with, cavities, such, as, trees, cliffs, or, even, walls, nestboxes, haystacks, and, abandoned, burrows, in, which, to, nest, these, requirements, can, be, provided, in, a, wide, range, of, ecosystems, and, as, a, consequence, the, hoopoe, inhabits, a, wide, range, of, habitats, such, as, heathland, wooded, steppes, savannas, and, grasslands, as, well, as, forest, glades, the, madagascar, species, also, makes, use, of, more, dense, primary, forest, the, modification, of, natural, habitats, by, humans, for, various, agricultural, purposes, has, led, to, hoopoes, becoming, common, in, olive, groves, orchards, vineyards, parkland, and, farmland, although, they, are, less, common, and, are, declining, in, intensively, farmed, areas, hunting, is, of, concern, in, southern, europe, and, asia, hoopoes, make, seasonal, movements, in, response, to, rain, in, some, regions, such, as, in, ceylon, and, in, the, western, ghats, birds, have, been, seen, at, high, altitudes, during, migration, across, the, himalayas, one, was, recorded, at, about, 6, 400, m, 21, 000, ft, by, the, first, mount, everest, expedition, in, what, was, long, thought, to, be, a, defensive, posture, hoopoes, sunbathe, by, spreading, out, their, wings, and, tail, low, against, the, ground, and, tilting, their, head, up, they, often, fold, their, wings, and, preen, halfway, through, they, also, enjoy, taking, dust, and, sand, baths, adults, may, begin, their, moult, after, the, breeding, season, and, continue, after, they, have, migrated, for, the, winter, the, diet, of, the, hoopoe, is, mostly, composed, of, insects, although, small, reptiles, frogs, and, plant, matter, such, as, seeds, and, berries, are, sometimes, taken, as, well, it, is, a, solitary, forager, which, typically, feeds, on, the, ground, more, rarely, they, will, feed, in, the, air, where, their, strong, and, rounded, wings, make, them, fast, and, manoeuverable, in, pursuit, of, numerous, swarming, insects, more, commonly, their, foraging, style, is, to, stride, over, relatively, open, ground, and, periodically, pause, to, probe, the, ground, with, the, full, length, of, their, bill, insect, larvae, pupae, and, mole, crickets, are, detected, by, the, bill, and, either, extracted, or, dug, out, with, the, strong, feet, hoopoes, will, also, feed, on, insects, on, the, surface, probe, into, piles, of, leaves, and, even, use, the, bill, to, lever, large, stones, and, flake, off, bark, common, diet, items, include, crickets, locusts, beetles, earwigs, cicadas, ant, lions, bugs, and, ants, these, can, range, from, 10, to, 150, millimetres, 0, 4, to, 5, 9, in, in, length, with, a, preferred, prey, size, of, around, 20, 30, millimetres, 0, 8, 1, 2, in, larger, prey, items, are, beaten, against, the, ground, or, a, preferred, stone, to, kill, them, and, remove, indigestible, body, parts, such, as, wings, and, legs, hoopoes, are, monogamous, although, the, pair, bond, apparently, only, lasts, for, a, single, season, they, are, also, territorial, the, male, calls, frequently, to, advertise, his, ownership, of, the, territory, chases, and, fights, between, rival, males, and, sometimes, females, are, common, and, can, be, brutal, birds, will, try, to, stab, rivals, with, their, bills, and, individuals, are, occasionally, blinded, in, fights, the, nest, is, in, a, hole, in, a, tree, or, wall, and, has, a, narrow, entrance, it, may, be, unlined, or, various, scraps, may, be, collected, the, female, alone, is, responsible, for, incubating, the, eggs, clutch, size, varies, with, location, northern, hemisphere, birds, lay, more, eggs, than, those, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, birds, at, higher, latitudes, have, larger, clutches, than, those, closer, to, the, equator, in, central, and, northern, europe, and, asia, the, clutch, size, is, around, 12, whereas, it, is, around, four, in, the, tropics, and, seven, in, the, subtropics, the, eggs, are, round, and, milky, blue, when, laid, but, quickly, discolour, in, the, increasingly, dirty, nest, they, weigh, 4, 5, grams, 0, 16, oz, a, replacement, clutch, is, possible, when, food, is, bountiful, the, female, will, lay, a, few, extra, eggs, for, the, purpose, of, providing, food, for, chicks, that, have, already, hatched, in, a, study, done, in, spain, it, was, found, that, nests, with, a, higher, incidence, of, cannibalism, successfully, fledged, more, chicks, than, in, nests, where, hatchlings, weren, t, fed, to, older, chicks, hoopoes, have, well, developed, anti, predator, defences, in, the, nest, the, uropygial, gland, of, the, incubating, and, brooding, female, is, quickly, modified, to, produce, a, foul, smelling, liquid, and, the, glands, of, nestlings, do, so, as, well, these, secretions, are, rubbed, into, the, plumage, the, secretion, which, smells, like, rotting, meat, is, thought, to, help, deter, predators, as, well, as, deter, parasites, and, possibly, act, as, an, antibacterial, agent, the, secretions, stop, soon, before, the, young, leave, the, nest, from, the, age, of, six, days, nestlings, can, also, direct, streams, of, faeces, at, intruders, and, will, hiss, at, them, in, a, snake, like, fashion, the, young, also, strike, with, their, bill, or, with, one, wing, the, incubation, period, for, the, species, is, between, 15, and, 18, days, during, which, time, the, male, feeds, the, female, incubation, begins, as, soon, as, the, first, egg, is, laid, so, the, chicks, are, born, asynchronously, the, chicks, hatch, with, a, covering, of, downy, feathers, by, around, day, three, to, five, feather, quills, emerge, which, will, become, the, adult, feathers, the, chicks, are, brooded, by, the, female, for, between, 9, and, 14, days, the, female, later, joins, the, male, in, the, task, of, bringing, food, the, young, fledge, in, 26, to, 29, days, and, remain, with, the, parents, for, about, a, week, more, the, diet, of, the, hoopoe, includes, many, species, considered, by, humans, to, be, pests, such, as, the, pupae, of, the, processionary, moth, a, damaging, forest, pest, which, few, other, birds, will, eat, because, of, its, irritating, hairs, for, this, reason, the, species, is, afforded, protection, under, the, law, in, many, countries, hoopoes, are, distinctive, birds, and, have, made, a, cultural, impact, over, much, of, their, range, they, were, considered, sacred, in, ancient, egypt, and, were, depicted, on, the, walls, of, tombs, and, temples, at, the, old, kingdom, the, hoopoe, was, used, in, the, iconography, as, a, symbolic, code, to, indicate, the, child, was, the, heir, and, successor, of, his, father, they, achieved, a, similar, standing, in, minoan, crete, in, the, torah, leviticus, 11, 13, 19, hoopoes, were, listed, among, the, animals, that, are, detestable, and, should, not, be, eaten, they, are, also, listed, in, deuteronomy, as, not, kosher, the, hoopoe, known, as, the, hudhud, also, appears, with, king, solomon, in, the, quran, in, surah, 27, al, naml, the, ant, 27, 20, one, day, he, inspected, the, birds, and, wondered, why, is, it, that, i, cannot, see, the, hoopoe, or, could, he, be, absent, 27, 21, i, will, surely, subject, him, to, a, severe, punishment, or, even, slaughter, him, unless, he, brings, me, a, compelling, excuse, 27, 22, it, was, not, long, before, the, bird, came, and, said, i, have, found, out, something, you, do, not, know, i, have, just, come, to, you, from, sheba, with, sure, news, 27, 23, indeed, i, found, a, woman, ruling, over, them, who, has, been, given, everything, she, needs, and, who, has, a, magnificent, throne, 27, 24, i, found, her, and,
