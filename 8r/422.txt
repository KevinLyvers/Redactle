there, are, 31, genera, and, about, 600, species, swallowtail, butterflies, are, large, colorful, butterflies, in, the, family, papilionidae, and, include, over, 550, species, though, the, majority, are, tropical, members, of, the, family, inhabit, every, continent, except, antarctica, the, family, includes, the, largest, butterflies, in, the, world, the, birdwing, butterflies, of, the, genus, ornithoptera, swallowtails, have, a, number, of, distinctive, features, for, example, the, papilionid, caterpillar, bears, a, repugnatorial, organ, called, the, osmeterium, on, its, prothorax, the, osmeterium, normally, remains, hidden, but, when, threatened, the, larva, turns, it, outward, through, a, transverse, dorsal, groove, by, inflating, it, with, fluid, the, forked, appearance, in, some, of, the, swallowtails, hindwings, which, can, be, seen, when, the, butterfly, is, resting, with, its, wings, spread, gave, rise, to, the, common, name, swallowtail, as, for, its, formal, name, linnaeus, chose, papilio, for, the, type, genus, as, papilio, is, latin, for, butterfly, for, the, specific, epithets, of, the, genus, linnaeus, applied, the, names, of, greek, figures, to, the, swallowtails, the, type, species, papilio, machaon, honored, machaon, one, of, the, sons, of, asclepius, mentioned, in, the, iliad, further, the, species, papilio, homerus, is, named, after, the, greek, poet, homer, the, mon, of, the, taira, clan, of, japan, is, an, agehach, swallowtail, butterfly, the, genera, of, extant, swallowtails, are, usually, classified, into, three, subfamilies, baroniinae, parnassiinae, and, papilioninae, the, latter, two, being, further, divided, into, tribes, in, swallowtails, besides, morphological, characteristics, the, choice, of, food, plants, and, ecological, lifestyle, reflect, phylogeny, and, classification, the, baroniinae, are, a, monotypic, subfamily, restricted, to, a, very, small, region, in, mexico, and, are, considered, to, be, the, most, basal, of, the, subfamilies, baronia, brevicornis, is, considered, to, be, a, relict, species, and, shares, features, with, a, fossil, taxon, praepapilio, baronia, is, unique, among, papilionidae, as, having, an, acacia, species, family, leguminosae, as, its, food, plant, subfamily, baroniene, the, parnassiinae, are, a, subfamily, of, essentially, holarctic, butterflies, the, vast, majority, of, species, mostly, parnassius, can, be, found, in, mountain, habitats, parnassiinines, can, also, be, found, in, other, habitats, such, as, arid, deserts, hypermnestra, humid, forests, luehdorfia, and, even, lowland, meadows, zerynthia, the, tribes, recognized, in, the, parnassiinae, are, parnassiini, zerynthiini, and, luehdorfiini, tribe, parnassiini, contains, two, genera, hypermnestra, largely, confined, to, central, asia, and, the, genus, parnassius, the, apollos, a, distinctive, group, of, many, species, all, of, which, are, alpine, and, capable, of, living, at, high, altitudes, most, parnassius, have, two, small, reddish, spots, on, their, hindwings, the, tribe, luehdorfiini, contains, the, genera, archon, of, asia, minor, and, the, genus, luehdorfia, of, china, and, japan, these, two, tribes, have, evolved, to, change, their, food, plants, while, the, third, tribe, zerynthiini, has, retained, the, archetypical, papilionid, food, plant, the, lowland, vine, aristolochia, zerynthiini, comprises, four, genera, sericinus, bhutanitis, zerynthia, and, allancastria, 13, subfamily, parnassiinae, the, tribes, recognized, in, the, papilioninae, are, leptocircini, teinopalpini, troidini, and, papilionini, subfamily, papilioninae, an, additional, subfamily, praepapilioninae, consisting, of, a, single, genus, praepapilio, includes, two, species, of, extinct, butterflies, each, member, being, described, from, single, fossils, found, in, a, middle, eocene, deposit, in, colorado, united, states, durden, and, rose, 1978, a, phylogeny, of, the, papilionidae, based, on, nazari, 2007, is, given, praepapilioninae, baroniinae, parnassiini, zerynthiini, luehdorfiini, leptocircini, teinopalpini, papilionini, troidini, it, is, now, accepted, that, the, subfamily, papilioninae, is, monophyletic, the, swallowtail, butterflies, in, the, nominate, tribe, papilionini, number, about, 225, species, and, studies, have, been, made, on, their, host, plant, coevolution, and, phylogeny, old, morphological, classifications, were, also, found, to, be, valid, in, that, they, formed, clusters, species, belonging, to, the, groups, that, use, rutaceae, as, host, plants, formed, two, groups, corresponding, to, old, world, and, american, taxa, those, that, fed, on, lauraceae, and, magnoliaceae, were, found, to, form, another, cluster, which, includes, both, asian, and, american, taxa, the, parnassinae, like, the, papilioninae, were, also, believed, to, be, monophyletic, based, on, morphological, studies, but, recent, studies, based, on, both, morphological, and, molecular, characteristics, suggest, that, this, is, not, the, case, of, the, parnassiinae, the, genera, parnassius, and, hypermnestra, were, found, to, be, extremely, close, based, on, molecular, studies, and, are, now, considered, to, be, part, of, the, tribe, parnassiini, the, two, taxa, archon, and, luehdorfia, have, been, found, to, be, closely, related, through, analysis, of, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, dna, and, though, they, share, no, morphological, similarities, have, now, been, united, in, the, tribe, luehdorfiini, the, subfamily, baroniinae, is, represented, by, the, sole, representative, species, baronia, brevicornis, they, are, unique, in, the, family, to, use, the, fabaceae, leguminosae, as, their, larval, host, plants, the, baronninae, and, the, extinct, subfamily, praepapilioninae, share, many, external, similarities, and, are, traditionally, considered, to, be, the, most, primitive, subfamilies, and, sister, to, the, rest, of, the, swallowtails, recent, research, suggests, that, this, may, not, be, the, case, the, baroniinae, being, closely, related, to, only, the, parnassiinae, and, praepapilio, to, only, the, papilionini, and, neither, taxa, being, sister, to, the, rest, of, the, swallowtails, as, of, 2005, 552, extant, species, have, been, identified, which, are, distributed, across, the, tropical, and, temperate, regions, various, species, inhabit, altitudes, ranging, from, sea, level, to, high, mountains, as, in, the, case, of, most, species, of, parnassius, the, majority, of, swallowtail, species, and, the, greatest, diversity, are, found, in, the, tropics, and, subtropical, regions, between, 20, n, and, 20, s, particularly, southeast, asia, and, between, 20, n, and, 40, n, in, east, asia, only, 12, species, are, found, in, europe, and, only, one, species, papilio, machaon, is, found, in, the, british, isles, north, america, has, 40, species, including, several, tropical, species, and, parnassius, the, northernmost, swallowtail, is, the, siberian, apollo, parnassius, arcticus, found, in, the, arctic, circle, in, northeastern, yakutia, at, altitudes, of, 1500, meters, above, sea, level, in, the, himalayas, various, apollo, species, such, as, parnassius, epaphus, have, been, found, at, altitudes, of, 6, 000, meters, above, sea, level, 221, the, caterpillars, of, various, swallowtail, butterfly, species, feed, on, a, wide, range, of, different, plants, most, depending, on, only, one, of, five, families, aristolochiaceae, annonaceae, lauraceae, umbelliferae, apiaceae, and, rutaceae, by, eating, some, of, these, toxic, plants, the, caterpillars, sequester, aristolochic, acid, which, renders, both, the, caterpillars, and, the, butterflies, of, some, of, these, as, toxic, thus, protecting, them, from, predators, similarly, the, parnassius, smintheus, sequesters, sarmentosin, from, its, host, plant, sedum, lanceolatum, for, protection, from, predators, swallowtail, tribes, zerynthiini, parnassiinae, luehdorfiini, parnassiinae, and, troidini, papilioninae, almost, exclusively, use, the, family, aristolochiaceae, as, their, host, plants, for, example, the, eastern, black, swallowtail, s, papilio, polyxenes, main, host, plant, in, the, wild, is, queen, anne, s, lace, but, they, also, eat, garden, plants, in, the, carrot, family, including, carrots, parsley, dill, and, fennel, adult, swallowtails, sip, nectar, but, also, mud, and, sometimes, manure, the, detailed, descriptions, of, morphological, characteristics, of, the, papilionidae, as, quoted, in, bingham, 1905, are, as, follows, 1, 2, egg, dome, shaped, smooth, or, obscurely, facetted, not, as, high, as, wide, somewhat, leathery, opaque, doherty, larva, stout, smooth, or, with, a, series, of, fleshy, tubercles, on, the, dorsum, sometimes, with, a, raised, fleshy, protuberance, the, so, called, hood, or, crest, on, the, fourth, segment, the, second, segment, has, a, transverse, opening, out, of, which, the, larva, protrudes, at, will, and, an, erect, forked, glandular, fleshy, organ, that, emits, a, strong, penetrating, and, somewhat, unpleasant, odor, pupa, variable, in, form, but, most, often, curved, backwards, it, is, angulate, with, the, head, truncate, or, rounded, and, the, back, of, abdomen, is, smooth, or, tuberculate, it, is, attached, by, the, tail, normally, in, a, perpendicular, position, and, further, secured, by, a, silken, girth, round, the, middle, in, parnassius, the, pupa, is, placed, in, a, loose, silken, web, between, leaves, imago, wings, extraordinarily, variable, in, shape, hindwing, very, frequently, has, a, tail, which, may, be, slender, or, broad, and, spatulate, but, is, always, an, extension, of, the, termen, at, vein, 4, in, one, genus, armandia, the, termen, of, the, hindwing, is, prolonged, into, tails, at, the, apices, of, veins, 2, and, 3, as, well, as, at, vein, 4, forewing, except, in, the, aberrant, genera, parnassius, and, hypermnestra, with, all, 12, veins, present, and, in, addition, a, short, internal, vein, vein, 1, a, that, invariably, terminates, on, the, dorsal, margin, stages, of, development, of, a, papilionid, the, giant, swallowtail, papilio, cresphontes, the, key, characteristics, that, differentiate, the, papilionidae, from, the, other, butterfly, families, are, swallowtail, butterflies, practice, batesian, mimicry, a, behavior, in, which, the, butterflies, appearance, closely, resemble, that, of, distasteful, species, that, prevents, predation, swallowtails, differ, from, many, animals, that, practice, mimicry, the, tiger, swallowtail, butterfly, papilio, glaucus, exhibits, a, female, limited, polymorphism, for, batesian, mimicry, and, others, such, as, the, canadian, tiger, swallowtail, papilio, canadensis, do, not, display, any, form, of, mimicry, predators, include, the, red, winged, blackbird, pennsylvania, firefly, five, lined, skink, green, darner, goldenrod, spider, chinese, mantis, fiery, searcher, and, striped, skunk, not, all, individuals, in, some, species, are, identical, in, appearance, for, example, papilio, glaucus, eastern, tiger, swallowtail, y, linkage, determines, whether, the, females, are, either, wild, type, yellow, and, black, or, melanic, dark, melanin, replaces, the, yellow, background, this, genetic, difference, stems, from, the, fact, that, melanism, is, controlled, by, a, single, gene, which, controls, the, level, of, dopamine, in, the, organism, the, enzyme, bas, which, assists, dopamine, in, producing, the, yellow, pigmentation, normally, found, on, the, wings, background, is, suppressed, without, the, pigmentation, the, butterfly, appears, mostly, black, the, melanic, form, and, is, a, batesian, mimic, of, battus, philenor, the, pipevine, swallowtail, there, are, also, papilio, glaucus, that, are, not, wholly, black, several, possess, an, intermediate, sooty, color, and, are, sensitive, to, temperature, the, different, polymorphisms, wild, type, melanic, and, the, sooty, intermediate, depend, upon, the, geographical, distribution, and, abundance, of, its, mimic, the, battus, philenor, whose, wing, color, varies, depending, on, its, geographical, location, in, order, to, be, successfully, confused, for, the, b, philenor, by, predators, the, papilio, glaucus, s, background, wing, color, matches, that, of, the, b, philenor, residing, in, the, same, regional, area, studies, support, this, theory, in, the, southeastern, united, states, the, relative, abundance, of, melanic, females, has, been, found, to, geographically, correlate, with, b, philenor, only, certain, subsets, of, swallowtails, practice, mimicry, species, differ, in, whether, one, or, both, sexes, is, mimetic, and, whether, the, mimicry, is, monomorphic, or, polymorphic, a, phenomenon, which, has, received, particular, attention, is, female, limited, polymorphism, in, which, only, the, females, of, a, species, are, mimetic, and, polymorphic, often, mimicking, different, distantly, related, aposematic, butterflies, this, polymorphism, is, seen, in, papilio, dardanus, the, african, swallowtail, butterfly, whose, females, have, three, different, morphs, for, wing, color, pattern, a, black, and, white, pattern, for, batesian, mimicry, a, black, and, yellow, pattern, that, resembles, the, males, of, the, species, and, a, pattern, with, orange, patches, that, resembles, the, elderly, males, of, the, species, given, that, the, males, of, the, species, which, do, not, have, batesian, mimicry, are, preyed, upon, much, more, frequently, by, predators, than, the, females, an, ongoing, question, is, why, females, would, exhibit, the, non, mimetic, wing, pattern, which, would, seemingly, lower, their, fitness, compared, to, the, mimicry, form, the, pipevine, swallowtail, exhibits, batesian, mimicry, as, well, several, hypotheses, for, this, phenomenon, were, made, the, two, noteworthy, being, the, pseudosexual, selection, hypothesis, and, the, male, avoidance, hypothesis, in, the, pseudosexual, hypothesis, male, butterflies, aggressively, approached, the, male, looking, females, and, then, mellowed, their, behavior, into, sexual, behavior, when, they, were, close, enough, to, identify, them, as, females, in, the, male, avoidance, hypothesis, female, butterflies, disguise, themselves, in, an, attempt, to, evade, male, harassment, as, courtship, can, be, harmful, time, consuming, and, attract, predators, one, study, recorded, male, responses, to, females, of, each, morphs, and, found, that, the, males, consistently, favored, the, batesian, mimics, then, the, black, and, yellow, and, then, the, morph, with, orange, patches, the, scientists, concluded, that, frequency, dependent, selection, did, lead, to, equal, success, for, all, three, alternative, strategies, the, batesian, females, suffered, the, fewest, predators, but, their, fitness, was, reduced, the, most, by, sexual, harassment, while, the, other, two, faced, lower, sexual, harassment, but, also, lost, fitness, from, predators, attacks, after, mating, the, male, parnassines, produce, a, glue, like, substance, that, is, used, to, seal, the, female, genital, opening, and, prevent, other, males, from, mating, they, lay, individual, eggs, on, the, underside, of, the, leaves, of, their, food, plants, there, is, no, parental, investment, once, the, eggs, have, been, laid, the, pupae, are, typically, attached, to, the, substrate, by, the, cremaster, but, with, head, up, held, by, a, silk, girdle, the, apollos, however, pupate, in, debris, on, the, ground, and, also, build, a, loose, cocoon, in, the, temperate, regions, the, winters, are, passed, in, a, pupal, diapause, stage, since, swallowtail, butterflies, are, large, colorful, and, attractive, they, have, been, targeted, by, butterfly, collectors, the, largest, of, these, the, birdwing, butterflies, are, particularly, sought, after, and, are, cultured, in, butterfly, farms, to, supply, collectors, many, members, of, the, family, as, larvae, feed, on, plants, of, the, citrus, family, rutaceae, making, some, of, these, attractive, butterflies, pests, in, citrus, orchards, the, oregon, swallowtail, is, the, state, insect, of, oregon, the, eastern, tiger, swallowtail, is, the, state, insect, of, virginia, and,
