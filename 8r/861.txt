a, mammoth, is, any, species, of, the, extinct, elephantid, genus, mammuthus, they, lived, from, the, late, miocene, epoch, from, around, 6, 2, million, years, ago, into, the, holocene, about, 4, 000, years, ago, and, various, species, existed, in, africa, europe, asia, and, north, america, mammoths, are, distinguished, from, living, elephants, by, their, typically, large, spirally, twisted, tusks, and, in, at, least, some, later, species, the, development, of, numerous, adaptions, to, living, in, cold, environments, including, a, thick, layer, of, fur, mammoths, and, asian, elephants, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, of, them, are, to, african, elephants, the, oldest, mammoth, representative, mammuthus, subplanifrons, appeared, around, 6, million, years, ago, during, the, late, miocene, in, what, is, now, southern, and, eastern, africa, later, in, the, pliocene, by, about, three, million, years, ago, mammoths, dispersed, into, eurasia, eventually, covering, most, of, eurasia, before, migrating, into, north, america, around, 1, 5, 1, 3, million, years, ago, becoming, ancestral, to, the, columbian, mammoth, m, columbi, the, woolly, mammoth, m, primigenius, evolved, about, 700, 400, 000, years, ago, in, siberia, with, some, surviving, on, russia, s, wrangel, island, in, the, arctic, ocean, until, as, recently, as, 4, 000, years, ago, still, extant, during, the, existence, of, the, earliest, civilisations, in, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, according, to, the, american, heritage, dictionary, the, word, mammoth, likely, originates, from, m, n, o, t, a, word, in, the, mansi, languages, of, western, siberia, meaning, earth, horn, in, reference, to, mammoth, tusks, mammoths, appear, in, the, folkore, of, the, indigenous, people, of, siberia, who, were, impressed, by, the, great, size, of, their, remains, in, the, mythology, of, the, evenk, people, mammoths, were, responsible, for, the, creation, of, the, world, digging, up, the, land, from, the, ocean, floor, with, their, tusks, the, selkup, believed, that, mammoths, lived, underground, and, guarded, the, underworld, while, the, nenets, and, the, mansi, the, latter, of, whom, along, with, the, khanty, conceived, mammoths, as, giant, birds, believed, that, mammoths, were, responsible, for, the, creation, of, mountains, and, lakes, while, the, yakuts, regarded, mammoths, as, water, spirits, the, word, mammoth, was, first, used, in, europe, during, the, early, 17th, century, when, referring, to, maimanto, tusks, discovered, in, siberia, as, recorded, in, the, 1618, edition, of, the, dictionariolum, russico, anglicum, the, earliest, scientific, research, paper, on, mammoths, was, by, vasily, tatishchev, in, 1725, john, bell, who, was, on, the, ob, river, in, 1722, said, that, mammoth, tusks, were, well, known, in, the, area, they, were, called, mammon, s, horn, and, were, often, found, in, washed, out, river, banks, bell, bought, one, and, presented, it, to, hans, sloan, who, pronounced, it, an, elephant, s, tooth, in, 1796, french, biologist, georges, cuvier, was, the, first, to, identify, woolly, mammoth, remains, not, as, modern, elephants, transported, to, the, arctic, but, as, an, entirely, new, species, he, argued, this, species, had, gone, extinct, and, no, longer, existed, a, concept, that, was, not, widely, accepted, at, the, time, following, cuvier, s, identification, german, naturalist, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, gave, the, woolly, mammoth, its, scientific, name, elephas, primigenius, in, 1799, placing, it, in, the, elephas, the, genus, which, today, contains, the, asian, elephant, elephas, maximus, originally, the, african, elephants, as, well, as, the, american, mastodon, described, in, 1792, were, also, placed, in, elephas, cuvier, coined, the, synonym, elephas, mammonteus, for, the, woolly, mammoth, a, few, months, later, but, e, primigenius, became, the, widely, used, name, for, the, species, including, by, cuvier, the, genus, name, mammuthus, was, coined, by, british, anatomist, joshua, brookes, in, 1828, as, part, of, a, survey, of, his, museum, collection, thomas, jefferson, who, famously, had, a, keen, interest, in, paleontology, is, partially, responsible, for, transforming, the, word, mammoth, from, a, noun, describing, the, prehistoric, elephant, to, an, adjective, describing, anything, of, surprisingly, large, size, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, word, as, an, adjective, was, in, a, description, of, a, large, wheel, of, cheese, the, cheshire, mammoth, cheese, given, to, jefferson, in, 1802, the, earliest, known, proboscideans, the, clade, that, contains, the, elephants, arose, about, 55, million, years, ago, on, the, landmass, of, afro, arabia, the, closest, relatives, of, the, proboscidea, are, the, sirenians, and, the, hyraxes, the, family, elephantidae, arose, by, million, years, ago, in, africa, and, includes, the, living, elephants, and, the, mammoths, among, many, now, extinct, clades, the, mastodon, is, only, a, distant, relative, of, the, mammoths, and, part, of, the, separate, mammutidae, family, which, diverged, 25, million, years, before, the, mammoths, evolved, following, the, publication, of, the, woolly, mammoths, mitochondrial, genome, sequence, in, 1997, it, has, since, become, widely, accepted, that, mammoths, and, asian, elephants, share, a, closer, relationship, to, each, other, than, either, do, to, african, elephants, the, following, cladogram, shows, the, placement, of, the, genus, mammuthus, among, other, proboscideans, based, on, hyoid, characteristics, and, genetics, mammutidae, mastodons, gomphotheriidae, gomphotheres, stegodontidae, stegodontids, loxodonta, african, elephants, palaeoloxodon, straight, tusked, elephants, elephas, asian, elephants, mammuthus, mammoths, it, is, possible, to, reconstruct, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, genus, through, morphological, studies, mammoth, species, can, be, identified, from, the, number, of, enamel, ridges, lamellae, on, their, molars, the, primitive, species, had, few, ridges, and, the, amount, increased, gradually, as, new, species, evolved, and, replaced, the, former, ones, at, the, same, time, the, crowns, of, the, teeth, became, longer, and, the, skulls, became, higher, from, top, to, bottom, and, shorter, from, the, back, to, the, front, over, time, to, accommodate, this, the, earliest, mammoths, assigned, to, the, species, mammuthus, subplanifrons, are, known, from, southern, and, eastern, africa, with, the, earliest, records, dating, to, the, late, miocene, around, 6, 2, 5, 3, million, years, ago, by, the, late, pliocene, mammoths, had, become, confined, to, the, northern, portions, of, the, african, continent, with, remains, from, this, time, assigned, to, mammuthus, africanavus, during, the, late, pliocene, by, 3, 2, million, years, ago, mammoths, dispersed, into, eurasia, via, the, sinai, peninsula, the, earliest, mammoths, in, eurasia, are, assigned, to, the, species, mammuthus, rumanus, the, youngest, remains, of, mammoths, in, africa, are, from, a, n, boucherit, algeria, dating, to, the, early, pleistocene, around, 2, 3, 2, million, years, ago, with, a, possible, later, record, from, a, n, hanech, algeria, dating, to, 1, 95, 1, 78, million, years, ago, mammuthus, rumanus, is, thought, to, be, the, ancestor, of, mammuthus, meridionalis, which, first, appeared, at, the, beginning, of, the, pleistocene, around, 2, 6, million, years, ago, mammuthus, meridionalis, subsequently, gave, rise, to, mammuthus, trogontherii, the, steppe, mammoth, in, eastern, asia, around, 1, 7, million, years, ago, around, 1, 5, 1, 3, million, years, ago, m, trogontherii, crossed, the, bering, land, bridge, into, north, america, becoming, ancestral, to, mammuthus, columbi, the, columbian, mammoth, at, the, end, of, the, early, pleistocene, mammuthus, trogontherii, migrated, into, europe, replacing, m, meridionalis, around, 1, 0, 8, million, years, ago, mammuthus, primigenius, the, woolly, mammoth, had, evolved, from, m, trogontherii, in, siberia, by, around, 600, 000, 500, 000, years, ago, replacing, m, trogontherii, in, europe, by, around, 200, 000, years, ago, and, migrated, into, north, america, during, the, late, pleistocene, a, number, of, dwarf, mammoth, species, with, small, body, sizes, evolved, on, islands, as, a, result, of, insular, dwarfism, these, include, mammuthus, lamarmorai, on, sardinia, late, middle, late, pleistocene, mammuthus, exilis, on, the, channel, islands, of, california, late, pleistocene, and, mammuthus, creticus, on, crete, early, pleistocene, like, living, elephants, mammoths, typically, had, large, body, sizes, the, largest, known, species, like, mammuthus, meridionalis, and, mammuthus, trogontherii, the, steppe, mammoth, were, considerably, larger, than, modern, elephants, with, mature, adult, males, having, an, average, height, of, approximately, 3, 8, 4, 2, m, 12, 5, 13, 8, ft, at, the, shoulder, and, weights, of, 9, 6, 12, 7, tonnes, 21, 000, 28, 000, lb, while, exceptionally, large, males, may, have, reached, 4, 5, m, 14, 8, ft, at, the, shoulder, and, 14, 3, tonnes, 31, 526, 1, lb, in, weight, however, woolly, mammoths, were, considerably, smaller, only, about, as, large, as, modern, african, bush, elephants, with, males, around, 2, 80, 3, 15, m, 9, ft, 2, 2, in, 10, ft, 4, 0, in, high, at, the, shoulder, and, 4, 5, 6, tonnes, 9, 900, 13, 200, lb, in, weight, on, average, with, the, largest, recorded, individuals, being, around, 3, 5, m, 11, 5, ft, tall, and, 8, 2, tonnes, 18, 077, 9, lb, in, weight, the, insular, dwarf, mammoth, species, were, considerably, smaller, with, the, smallest, species, m, creticus, estimated, to, have, a, shoulder, height, of, only, around, 1, metre, 3, 3, ft, and, a, weight, of, about, 180, kilograms, 400, lb, making, it, one, of, the, smallest, elephantids, known, the, number, of, lamellae, ridge, like, structures, on, the, molars, particularly, on, the, third, molars, substantially, increased, over, the, course, of, mammoth, evolution, the, earliest, eurasian, species, m, rumanus, have, around, 8, 10, lamellae, on, the, third, molars, while, late, pleistocene, woolly, mammoths, have, 20, 28, lamellae, on, the, third, molars, these, changes, also, corresponded, with, reduced, enamel, thickness, and, increasing, tooth, height, hypsodonty, these, changes, are, thought, to, be, adaptations, to, increasing, abrasion, resulting, from, the, shift, in, the, diet, of, mammoths, from, a, browsing, based, diet, in, m, rumanus, towards, a, grazing, diet, in, later, species, both, sexes, bore, tusks, a, first, small, set, appeared, at, about, the, age, of, six, months, and, these, were, replaced, at, about, 18, months, by, the, permanent, set, growth, of, the, permanent, set, was, at, a, rate, of, about, 2, 5, to, 15, 2, cm, 1, to, 6, in, per, year, the, tusks, display, a, strong, spiral, twisting, mammoth, tusks, are, among, the, largest, known, among, proboscideans, with, some, specimens, over, 4, m, 13, 1, ft, in, length, and, likely, 200, kg, 440, 9, lb, in, weight, with, some, historical, reports, suggesting, tusks, of, columbian, mammoths, could, reach, lengths, of, around, 5, m, 16, 4, ft, substantially, surpassing, the, largest, known, modern, elephant, tusks, the, heads, of, mammoths, were, prominently, domed, the, first, several, thoracic, vertebrae, of, mammoths, typically, had, long, neural, spines, the, back, was, typically, sloping, with, the, body, being, wider, than, that, of, african, elephants, the, tails, of, mammoths, were, relatively, short, compared, to, living, elephants, while, early, mammoth, species, like, m, meridionalis, were, probably, relatively, hairless, similar, to, modern, elephants, m, primigenius, and, likely, m, trogontherii, had, a, substantial, coat, of, fur, among, other, physiological, adaptations, for, living, in, cold, environments, genetic, sequencing, of, m, trogontherii, like, mammoths, over, 1, million, years, old, from, siberia, suggests, that, they, had, already, developed, many, of, the, genetic, changes, found, in, woolly, mammoths, responsible, for, tolerance, of, cold, conditions, scientists, discovered, and, studied, the, remains, of, a, mammoth, calf, and, found, that, fat, greatly, influenced, its, form, and, enabled, it, to, store, large, amounts, of, nutrients, necessary, for, survival, in, temperatures, as, low, as, 50, c, 58, f, the, fat, also, allowed, the, mammoths, to, increase, their, muscle, mass, allowing, the, mammoths, to, fight, against, enemies, and, live, longer, woolly, mammoths, evolved, a, suite, of, adaptations, for, arctic, life, including, morphological, traits, such, as, small, ears, and, tails, to, minimize, heat, loss, a, thick, layer, of, subcutaneous, fat, and, numerous, sebaceous, glands, for, insulation, as, well, as, a, large, brown, fat, hump, like, deposit, behind, the, neck, that, may, have, functioned, as, a, heat, source, and, fat, reservoir, during, winter, based, on, studies, of, their, close, relatives, the, modern, elephants, mammoths, probably, had, a, gestation, period, of, 22, months, resulting, in, a, single, calf, being, born, their, social, structure, was, probably, the, same, as, that, of, african, and, asian, elephants, with, females, living, in, herds, headed, by, a, matriarch, whilst, bulls, lived, solitary, lives, or, formed, loose, groups, after, sexual, maturity, with, adult, males, experiencing, periods, of, musth, the, earliest, mammoth, species, like, m, subplanifrons, and, m, rumanus, were, mixed, feeders, both, browsing, and, grazing, to, browsers, over, the, course, of, mammoth, evolution, in, eurasia, their, diet, shifted, towards, mixed, feeding, grazing, in, m, trogontherii, culminating, in, the, woolly, mammoth, which, was, largely, a, grazer, with, stomach, contents, of, woolly, mammoths, suggesting, that, they, largely, fed, on, grass, and, forbs, m, columbi, is, thought, to, have, been, a, mixed, feeder, evidence, that, humans, interacted, with, mammoths, extends, back, to, around, 1, 8, million, years, ago, with, a, number, of, bones, of, mammuthus, meridionalis, from, the, dmanisi, site, in, georgia, having, marks, suggested, to, the, result, of, butchery, by, archaic, humans, likely, as, a, result, of, scavenging, during, the, last, glacial, period, modern, humans, hunted, woolly, mammoths, used, their, remains, to, create, art, and, tools, and, depicted, them, in, works, of, art, remains, of, columbian, mammoths, at, a, number, of, sites, suggest, that, they, were, hunted, by, paleoindians, the, first, humans, to, inhabit, the, americas, a, possible, bone, engraving, of, a, columbian, mammoth, made, by, paleoindians, is, known, from, vero, beach, florida, following, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, the, range, of, the, woolly, mammoth, began, to, contract, disappearing, from, most, of, europe, by, 14, 000, years, ago, by, the, younger, dryas, around, 12, 900, 11, 700, years, before, present, woolly, mammoths, were, confined, to, the, northernmost, regions, of, siberia, this, contraction, is, suggested, to, have, been, caused, by, the, warming, induced, expansion, of, unfavourable, wet, tundra, and, forest, environments, at, the, expense, of, the, preferred, dry, open, mammoth, steppe, with, the, possible, additional, pressure, of, human, hunting, the, last, woolly, mammoths, in, mainland, siberia, became, extinct, around, 10, 000, years, ago, during, the, early, holocene, the, final, extinction, of, mainland, woolly, mammoths, may, have, been, driven, by, human, hunting, relict, populations, survived, on, saint, paul, island, in, the, bering, strait, until, around, 5, 600, years, ago, with, their, extinction, likely, due, to, the, degradation, of, freshwater, sources, and, on, wrangel, island, off, the, coast, of, northeast, siberia, until, around, 4, 000, years, ago, the, last, reliable, dates, of, the, columbian, mammoth, date, to, around, 12, 500, years, ago, columbian, mammoths, became, extinct, as, part, of, the, end, pleistocene, extinction, event, where, most, large, mammals, across, the, americas, became, extinct, approximately, simultaneously, at, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, hunting, of, columbian, mammoths, by, paleoindians, may, have, been, a, contributory, factor, in, their, extinction, the, timing, of, the, extinction, of, the, dwarf, sardinian, mammoth, mammuthus, lamarmorai, is, difficult, to, constrain, precisely, though, the, youngest, specimen, likely, dates, to, sometime, around, 57, 29, 000, years, ago, the, youngest, records, of, the, pygmy, mammoth, mammuthus, exillis, date, to, around, 13, 000, years, ago, coinciding, with, the, reducing, of, the, area, of, the, californian, channel, islands, as, a, result, of, rising, sea, level, the, earliest, known, humans, in, the, channel, islands, and, climatic, change, resulting, in, the, decline, of, the, previously, dominant, conifer, forest, ecosystems, and, expansion, of, scrub, and, grassland
