the, cell, cycle, or, cell, division, cycle, is, the, sequential, series, of, events, that, take, place, in, a, cell, that, causes, it, to, divide, into, two, daughter, cells, these, events, include, the, growth, of, the, cell, duplication, of, its, dna, dna, replication, and, some, of, its, organelles, and, subsequently, the, partitioning, of, its, cytoplasm, chromosomes, and, other, components, into, two, daughter, cells, in, a, process, called, cell, division, in, eukaryotic, cells, having, a, cell, nucleus, including, animal, plant, fungal, and, protist, cells, the, cell, cycle, is, divided, into, two, main, stages, interphase, and, the, m, phase, that, includes, mitosis, and, cytokinesis, during, interphase, the, cell, grows, accumulating, nutrients, needed, for, mitosis, and, replicates, its, dna, and, some, of, its, organelles, during, the, m, phase, the, replicated, chromosomes, organelles, and, cytoplasm, separate, into, two, new, daughter, cells, to, ensure, the, proper, replication, of, cellular, components, and, division, there, are, control, mechanisms, known, as, cell, cycle, checkpoints, after, each, of, the, key, steps, of, the, cycle, that, determine, if, the, cell, can, progress, to, the, next, phase, in, cells, without, nuclei, the, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, the, cell, cycle, is, divided, into, the, b, c, and, d, periods, the, b, period, extends, from, the, end, of, cell, division, to, the, beginning, of, dna, replication, dna, replication, occurs, during, the, c, period, the, d, period, refers, to, the, stage, between, the, end, of, dna, replication, and, the, splitting, of, the, bacterial, cell, into, two, daughter, cells, in, single, celled, organisms, a, single, cell, division, cycle, is, how, the, organism, reproduces, to, ensure, its, survival, in, multicellular, organisms, such, as, plants, and, animals, a, series, of, cell, division, cycles, is, how, the, organism, develops, from, a, single, celled, fertilized, egg, into, a, mature, organism, and, is, also, the, process, by, which, hair, skin, blood, cells, and, some, internal, organs, are, regenerated, and, healed, with, possible, exception, of, nerves, see, nerve, damage, after, cell, division, each, of, the, daughter, cells, begin, the, interphase, of, a, new, cell, cycle, although, the, various, stages, of, interphase, are, not, usually, morphologically, distinguishable, each, phase, of, the, cell, cycle, has, a, distinct, set, of, specialized, biochemical, processes, that, prepare, the, cell, for, initiation, of, the, cell, division, the, eukaryotic, cell, cycle, consists, of, four, distinct, phases, g, 1, phase, s, phase, synthesis, g, 2, phase, collectively, known, as, interphase, and, m, phase, mitosis, and, cytokinesis, m, phase, is, itself, composed, of, two, tightly, coupled, processes, mitosis, in, which, the, cell, s, nucleus, divides, and, cytokinesis, in, which, the, cell, s, cytoplasm, and, cell, membrane, divides, forming, two, daughter, cells, activation, of, each, phase, is, dependent, on, the, proper, progression, and, completion, of, the, previous, one, cells, that, have, temporarily, or, reversibly, stopped, dividing, are, said, to, have, entered, a, state, of, quiescence, called, g, 0, phase, or, the, resting, phase, g, 0, is, a, resting, phase, where, the, cell, has, left, the, cycle, and, has, stopped, dividing, the, cell, cycle, starts, with, this, phase, non, proliferative, non, dividing, cells, in, multicellular, eukaryotes, generally, enter, the, quiescent, g, 0, state, from, g, 1, and, may, remain, quiescent, for, long, periods, of, time, possibly, indefinitely, as, is, often, the, case, for, neurons, this, is, very, common, for, cells, that, are, fully, differentiated, some, cells, enter, the, g, 0, phase, semi, permanently, and, are, considered, post, mitotic, e, g, some, liver, kidney, and, stomach, cells, many, cells, do, not, enter, g, 0, and, continue, to, divide, throughout, an, organism, s, life, e, g, epithelial, cells, the, word, post, mitotic, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, both, quiescent, and, senescent, cells, cellular, senescence, occurs, in, response, to, dna, damage, and, external, stress, and, usually, constitutes, an, arrest, in, g, 1, cellular, senescence, may, make, a, cell, s, progeny, nonviable, it, is, often, a, biochemical, alternative, to, the, self, destruction, of, such, a, damaged, cell, by, apoptosis, interphase, represents, the, phase, between, two, successive, m, phases, interphase, is, a, series, of, changes, that, takes, place, in, a, newly, formed, cell, and, its, nucleus, before, it, becomes, capable, of, division, again, it, is, also, called, preparatory, phase, or, intermitosis, typically, interphase, lasts, for, at, least, 91, of, the, total, time, required, for, the, cell, cycle, interphase, proceeds, in, three, stages, g, 1, s, and, g, 2, followed, by, the, cycle, of, mitosis, and, cytokinesis, the, cell, s, nuclear, dna, contents, are, duplicated, during, s, phase, the, first, phase, within, interphase, from, the, end, of, the, previous, m, phase, until, the, beginning, of, dna, synthesis, is, called, g, 1, g, indicating, gap, it, is, also, called, the, growth, phase, during, this, phase, the, biosynthetic, activities, of, the, cell, which, are, considerably, slowed, down, during, m, phase, resume, at, a, high, rate, the, duration, of, g, 1, is, highly, variable, even, among, different, cells, of, the, same, species, in, this, phase, the, cell, increases, its, supply, of, proteins, increases, the, number, of, organelles, such, as, mitochondria, ribosomes, and, grows, in, size, in, g, 1, phase, a, cell, has, three, options, the, deciding, point, is, called, check, point, restriction, point, this, check, point, is, called, the, restriction, point, or, start, and, is, regulated, by, g, 1, s, cyclins, which, cause, transition, from, g, 1, to, s, phase, passage, through, the, g, 1, check, point, commits, the, cell, to, division, the, ensuing, s, phase, starts, when, dna, synthesis, commences, when, it, is, complete, all, of, the, chromosomes, have, been, replicated, i, e, each, chromosome, consists, of, two, sister, chromatids, thus, during, this, phase, the, amount, of, dna, in, the, cell, has, doubled, though, the, ploidy, and, number, of, chromosomes, are, unchanged, rates, of, rna, transcription, and, protein, synthesis, are, very, low, during, this, phase, an, exception, to, this, is, histone, production, most, of, which, occurs, during, the, s, phase, g, 2, phase, occurs, after, dna, replication, and, is, a, period, of, protein, synthesis, and, rapid, cell, growth, to, prepare, the, cell, for, mitosis, during, this, phase, microtubules, begin, to, reorganize, to, form, a, spindle, preprophase, before, proceeding, to, mitotic, phase, cells, must, be, checked, at, the, g, 2, checkpoint, for, any, dna, damage, within, the, chromosomes, the, g, 2, checkpoint, is, mainly, regulated, by, the, tumor, protein, p53, if, the, dna, is, damaged, p53, will, either, repair, the, dna, or, trigger, the, apoptosis, of, the, cell, if, p53, is, dysfunctional, or, mutated, cells, with, damaged, dna, may, continue, through, the, cell, cycle, leading, to, the, development, of, cancer, the, relatively, brief, m, phase, consists, of, nuclear, division, karyokinesis, and, division, of, cytoplasm, cytokinesis, it, is, a, relatively, short, period, of, the, cell, cycle, m, phase, is, complex, and, highly, regulated, the, sequence, of, events, is, divided, into, phases, corresponding, to, the, completion, of, one, set, of, activities, and, the, start, of, the, next, these, phases, are, sequentially, known, as, mitosis, is, the, process, by, which, a, eukaryotic, cell, separates, the, chromosomes, in, its, cell, nucleus, into, two, identical, sets, in, two, nuclei, during, the, process, of, mitosis, the, pairs, of, chromosomes, condense, and, attach, to, microtubules, that, pull, the, sister, chromatids, to, opposite, sides, of, the, cell, mitosis, occurs, exclusively, in, eukaryotic, cells, but, occurs, in, different, ways, in, different, species, for, example, animal, cells, undergo, an, open, mitosis, where, the, nuclear, envelope, breaks, down, before, the, chromosomes, separate, while, fungi, such, as, aspergillus, nidulans, and, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, yeast, undergo, a, closed, mitosis, where, chromosomes, divide, within, an, intact, cell, nucleus, mitosis, is, immediately, followed, by, cytokinesis, which, divides, the, nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles, and, cell, membrane, into, two, cells, containing, roughly, equal, shares, of, these, cellular, components, cytokinesis, occurs, differently, in, plant, and, animal, cells, while, the, cell, membrane, forms, a, groove, that, gradually, deepens, to, separate, the, cytoplasm, in, animal, cells, a, cell, plate, is, formed, to, separate, it, in, plant, cells, the, position, of, the, cell, plate, is, determined, by, the, position, of, a, preprophase, band, of, microtubules, and, actin, filaments, mitosis, and, cytokinesis, together, define, the, division, of, the, parent, cell, into, two, daughter, cells, genetically, identical, to, each, other, and, to, their, parent, cell, this, accounts, for, approximately, 10, of, the, cell, cycle, because, cytokinesis, usually, occurs, in, conjunction, with, mitosis, mitosis, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, m, phase, however, there, are, many, cells, where, mitosis, and, cytokinesis, occur, separately, forming, single, cells, with, multiple, nuclei, in, a, process, called, endoreplication, this, occurs, most, notably, among, the, fungi, and, slime, molds, but, is, found, in, various, groups, even, in, animals, cytokinesis, and, mitosis, may, occur, independently, for, instance, during, certain, stages, of, fruit, fly, embryonic, development, errors, in, mitosis, can, result, in, cell, death, through, apoptosis, or, cause, mutations, that, may, lead, to, cancer, regulation, of, the, cell, cycle, involves, processes, crucial, to, the, survival, of, a, cell, including, the, detection, and, repair, of, genetic, damage, as, well, as, the, prevention, of, uncontrolled, cell, division, the, molecular, events, that, control, the, cell, cycle, are, ordered, and, directional, that, is, each, process, occurs, in, a, sequential, fashion, and, it, is, impossible, to, reverse, the, cycle, two, key, classes, of, regulatory, molecules, cyclins, and, cyclin, dependent, kinases, cdks, determine, a, cell, s, progress, through, the, cell, cycle, leland, h, hartwell, r, timothy, hunt, and, paul, m, nurse, won, the, 2001, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, their, discovery, of, these, central, molecules, many, of, the, genes, encoding, cyclins, and, cdks, are, conserved, among, all, eukaryotes, but, in, general, more, complex, organisms, have, more, elaborate, cell, cycle, control, systems, that, incorporate, more, individual, components, many, of, the, relevant, genes, were, first, identified, by, studying, yeast, especially, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, genetic, nomenclature, in, yeast, dubs, many, of, these, genes, cdc, for, cell, division, cycle, followed, by, an, identifying, number, e, g, cdc25, or, cdc20, cyclins, form, the, regulatory, subunits, and, cdks, the, catalytic, subunits, of, an, activated, heterodimer, cyclins, have, no, catalytic, activity, and, cdks, are, inactive, in, the, absence, of, a, partner, cyclin, when, activated, by, a, bound, cyclin, cdks, perform, a, common, biochemical, reaction, called, phosphorylation, that, activates, or, inactivates, target, proteins, to, orchestrate, coordinated, entry, into, the, next, phase, of, the, cell, cycle, different, cyclin, cdk, combinations, determine, the, downstream, proteins, targeted, cdks, are, constitutively, expressed, in, cells, whereas, cyclins, are, synthesised, at, specific, stages, of, the, cell, cycle, in, response, to, various, molecular, signals, upon, receiving, a, pro, mitotic, extracellular, signal, g, 1, cyclin, cdk, complexes, become, active, to, prepare, the, cell, for, s, phase, promoting, the, expression, of, transcription, factors, that, in, turn, promote, the, expression, of, s, cyclins, and, of, enzymes, required, for, dna, replication, the, g, 1, cyclin, cdk, complexes, also, promote, the, degradation, of, molecules, that, function, as, s, phase, inhibitors, by, targeting, them, for, ubiquitination, once, a, protein, has, been, ubiquitinated, it, is, targeted, for, proteolytic, degradation, by, the, proteasome, however, results, from, a, recent, study, of, e2f, transcriptional, dynamics, at, the, single, cell, level, argue, that, the, role, of, g1, cyclin, cdk, activities, in, particular, cyclin, d, cdk4, 6, is, to, tune, the, timing, rather, than, the, commitment, of, cell, cycle, entry, active, s, cyclin, cdk, complexes, phosphorylate, proteins, that, make, up, the, pre, replication, complexes, assembled, during, g, 1, phase, on, dna, replication, origins, the, phosphorylation, serves, two, purposes, to, activate, each, already, assembled, pre, replication, complex, and, to, prevent, new, complexes, from, forming, this, ensures, that, every, portion, of, the, cell, s, genome, will, be, replicated, once, and, only, once, the, reason, for, prevention, of, gaps, in, replication, is, fairly, clear, because, daughter, cells, that, are, missing, all, or, part, of, crucial, genes, will, die, however, for, reasons, related, to, gene, copy, number, effects, possession, of, extra, copies, of, certain, genes, is, also, deleterious, to, the, daughter, cells, mitotic, cyclin, cdk, complexes, which, are, synthesized, but, inactivated, during, s, and, g, 2, phases, promote, the, initiation, of, mitosis, by, stimulating, downstream, proteins, involved, in, chromosome, condensation, and, mitotic, spindle, assembly, a, critical, complex, activated, during, this, process, is, a, ubiquitin, ligase, known, as, the, anaphase, promoting, complex, apc, which, promotes, degradation, of, structural, proteins, associated, with, the, chromosomal, kinetochore, apc, also, targets, the, mitotic, cyclins, for, degradation, ensuring, that, telophase, and, cytokinesis, can, proceed, cyclin, d, is, the, first, cyclin, produced, in, the, cells, that, enter, the, cell, cycle, in, response, to, extracellular, signals, e, g, growth, factors, cyclin, d, levels, stay, low, in, resting, cells, that, are, not, proliferating, additionally, cdk4, 6, and, cdk2, are, also, inactive, because, cdk4, 6, are, bound, by, ink4, family, members, e, g, p16, limiting, kinase, activity, meanwhile, cdk2, complexes, are, inhibited, by, the, cip, kip, proteins, such, as, p21, and, p27, when, it, is, time, for, a, cell, to, enter, the, cell, cycle, which, is, triggered, by, a, mitogenic, stimuli, levels, of, cyclin, d, increase, in, response, to, this, trigger, cyclin, d, binds, to, existing, cdk4, 6, forming, the, active, cyclin, d, cdk4, 6, complex, cyclin, d, cdk4, 6, complexes, in, turn, mono, phosphorylates, the, retinoblastoma, susceptibility, protein, rb, to, prb, the, un, phosphorylated, rb, tumour, suppressor, functions, in, inducing, cell, cycle, exit, and, maintaining, g0, arrest, senescence, in, the, last, few, decades, a, model, has, been, widely, accepted, whereby, prb, proteins, are, inactivated, by, cyclin, d, cdk4, 6, mediated, phosphorylation, rb, has, 14, potential, phosphorylation, sites, cyclin, d, cdk, 4, 6, progressively, phosphorylates, rb, to, hyperphosphorylated, state, which, triggers, dissociation, of, prb, e2f, complexes, thereby, inducing, g1, s, cell, cycle, gene, expression, and, progression, into, s, phase, however, scientific, observations, from, a, recent, study, show, that, rb, is, present, in, three, types, of, isoforms, 1, un, phosphorylated, rb, in, g0, state, 2, mono, phosphorylated, rb, also, referred, to, as, hypo, phosphorylated, or, partially, phosphorylated, rb, in, early, g1, state, and, 3, inactive, hyper, phosphorylated, rb, in, late, g1, state, in, early, g1, cells, mono, phosphorylated, rb, exists, as, 14, different, isoforms, one, of, each, has, distinct, e2f, binding, affinity, rb, has, been, found, to, associate, with, hundreds, of, different, proteins, and, the, idea, that, different, mono, phosphorylated, rb, isoforms, have, different, protein, partners, was, very, appealing, a, recent, report, confirmed, that, mono, phosphorylation, controls, rb, s, association, with, other, proteins, and, generates, functional, distinct, forms, of, rb, all, different, mono, phosphorylated, rb, isoforms, inhibit, e2f, transcriptional, program, and, are, able, to, arrest, cells, in, g1, phase, importantly, different, mono, phosphorylated, forms, of, rb, have, distinct, transcriptional, outputs, that, are, extended, beyond, e2f, regulation, in, general, the, binding, of, prb, to, e2f, inhibits, the, e2f, target, gene, expression, of, certain, g1, s, and, s, transition, genes, including, e, type, cyclins, the, partial, phosphorylation, of, rb, de, represses, the, rb, mediated, suppression, of, e2f, target, gene, expression, begins, the, expression, of, cyclin, e, the, molecular, mechanism, that, causes, the, cell, switched, to, cyclin, e, activation, is, currently, not, known, but, as, cyclin, e, levels, rise, the, active, cyclin, e, cdk2, complex, is, formed, bringing, rb, to, be, inactivated, by, hyper, phosphorylation, hyperphosphorylated, rb, is, completely, dissociated, from, e2f, enabling, further, expression, of, a, wide, range, of, e2f, target, genes, are, required, for, driving, cells, to, proceed, into, s, phase, recently, it, has, been, identified, that, cyclin, d, cdk4, 6, binds, to, a, c, terminal, alpha, helix, region, of, rb, that, is, only, distinguishable, to, cyclin, d, rather, than, other, cyclins, cyclin, e, a, and, b, this, observation, based, on, the, structural, analysis, of, rb, phosphorylation, supports, that, rb, is, phosphorylated, in, a, different, level, through, multiple, cyclin, cdk, complexes, this, also, makes, feasible, the, current, model, of, a, simultaneous, switch, like, inactivation, of, all, mono, phosphorylated, rb, isoforms, through, one, type, of, rb, hyper, phosphorylation, mechanism, in, addition, mutational, analysis, of, the, cyclin, d, cdk, 4, 6, specific, rb, c, terminal, helix, shows, that, disruptions, of, cyclin, d, cdk, 4, 6, binding, to, rb, prevents, rb, phosphorylation, arrests, cells, in, g1, and, bolsters, rb, s, functions, in, tumor, suppressor, this, cyclin, cdk, driven, cell, cycle, transitional, mechanism, governs, a, cell, committed, to, the, cell, cycle, that, allows, cell, proliferation, a, cancerous, cell, growth, often, accompanies, with, deregulation, of, cyclin, d, cdk, 4, 6, activity, the, hyperphosphorylated, rb, dissociates, from, the, e2f, dp1, rb, complex, which, was, bound, to, the, e2f, responsive, genes, effectively, blocking, them, from, transcription, activating, e2f, activation, of, e2f, results, in, transcription, of, various, genes, like, cyclin, e, cyclin, a, dna, polymerase, thymidine, kinase, etc, cyclin, e, thus, produced, binds, to, cdk2, forming, the, cyclin, e, cdk2, complex, which, pushes, the, cell, from, g, 1, to, s, phase, g, 1, s, which, initiates, the, g, 2, m, transition, cyclin, b, cdk1, complex, activation, causes, breakdown, of, nuclear, envelope, and, initiation, of, prophase, and, subsequently, its, deactivation, causes, the, cell, to, exit, mitosis, a, quantitative, study, of, e2f, transcriptional, dynamics, at, the, single, cell, level, by, using, engineered, fluorescent, reporter, cells, provided, a, quantitative, framework, for, understanding, the, control, logic, of, cell, cycle, entry, challenging, the, canonical, textbook, model, genes, that, regulate, the, amplitude, of, e2f, accumulation, such, as, myc, determine, the, commitment, in, cell, cycle, and, s, phase, entry, g1, cyclin, cdk, activities, are, not, the, driver, of, cell, cycle, entry, instead, they, primarily, tune, the, timing, of, e2f, increase, thereby, modulating, the, pace, of, cell, cycle, progression, two, families, of, genes, the, cip, kip, cdk, interacting, protein, kinase, inhibitory, protein, family, and, the, ink4a, arf, in, hibitor, of, k, inase, 4, a, lternative, r, eading, f, rame, family, prevent, the, progression, of, the, cell, cycle, because, these, genes, are, instrumental, in, prevention, of, tumor, formation, they, are, known, as, tumor, suppressors, the, cip, kip, family, includes, the, genes, p21, p27, and, p57, they, halt, the, cell, cycle, in, g, 1, phase, by, binding, to, and, inactivating, cyclin, cdk, complexes, p21, is, activated, by, p53, which, in, turn, is, triggered, by, dna, damage, e, g, due, to, radiation, p27, is, activated, by, transforming, growth, factor, tgf, a, growth, inhibitor, the, ink4a, arf, family, includes, p16, ink4a, which, binds, to, cdk4, and, arrests, the, cell, cycle, in, g, 1, phase, and, p14, arf, which, prevents, p53, degradation, synthetic, inhibitors, of, cdc25, could, also, be, useful, for, the, arrest, of, cell, cycle, and, therefore, be, useful, as, antineoplastic, and, anticancer, agents, many, human, cancers, possess, the, hyper, activated, cdk, 4, 6, activities, given, the, observations, of, cyclin, d, cdk, 4, 6, functions, inhibition, of, cdk, 4, 6, should, result, in, preventing, a, malignant, tumor, from, proliferating, consequently, scientists, have, tried, to, invent, the, synthetic, cdk4, 6, inhibitor, as, cdk4, 6, has, been, characterized, to, be, a, therapeutic, target, for, anti, tumor, effectiveness, three, cdk4, 6, inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and, abemaciclib, currently, received, fda, approval, for, clinical, use, to, treat, advanced, stage, or, metastatic, hormone, receptor, positive, hr, positive, hr, her2, negative, her2, breast, cancer, for, example, palbociclib, is, an, orally, active, cdk4, 6, inhibitor, which, has, demonstrated, improved, outcomes, for, er, positive, her2, negative, advanced, breast, cancer, the, main, side, effect, is, neutropenia, which, can, be, managed, by, dose, reduction, cdk4, 6, targeted, therapy, will, only, treat, cancer, types, where, rb, is, expressed, cancer, cells, with, loss, of, rb, have, primary, resistance, to, cdk4, 6, inhibitors, current, evidence, suggests, that, a, semi, autonomous, transcriptional, network, acts, in, concert, with, the, cdk, cyclin, machinery, to, regulate, the, cell, cycle, several, gene, expression, studies, in, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, have, identified, 800, 1200, genes, that, change, expression, over, the, course, of, the, cell, cycle, they, are, transcribed, at, high, levels, at, specific, points, in, the, cell, cycle, and, remain, at, lower, levels, throughout, the, rest, of, the, cycle, while, the, set, of, identified, genes, differs, between, studies, due, to, the, computational, methods, and, criteria, used, to, identify, them, each, study, indicates, that, a, large, portion, of, yeast, genes, are, temporally, regulated, many, periodically, expressed, genes, are, driven, by, transcription, factors, that, are, also, periodically, expressed, one, screen, of, single, gene, knockouts, identified, 48, transcription, factors, about, 20, of, all, non, essential, transcription, factors, that, show, cell, cycle, progression, defects, genome, wide, studies, using, high, throughput, technologies, have, identified, the, transcription, factors, that, bind, to, the, promoters, of, yeast, genes, and, correlating, these, findings, with, temporal, expression, patterns, have, allowed, the, identification, of, transcription, factors, that, drive, phase, specific, gene, expression, the, expression, profiles, of, these, transcription, factors, are, driven, by, the, transcription, factors, that, peak, in, the, prior, phase, and, computational, models, have, shown, that, a, cdk, autonomous, network, of, these, transcription, factors, is, sufficient, to, produce, steady, state, oscillations, in, gene, expression, experimental, evidence, also, suggests, that, gene, expression, can, oscillate, with, the, period, seen, in, dividing, wild, type, cells, independently, of, the, cdk, machinery, orlando, et, al, used, microarrays, to, measure, the, expression, of, a, set, of, 1, 271, genes, that, they, identified, as, periodic, in, both, wild, type, cells, and, cells, lacking, all, s, phase, and, mitotic, cyclins, clb1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, of, the, 1, 271, genes, assayed, 882, continued, to, be, expressed, in, the, cyclin, deficient, cells, at, the, same, time, as, in, the, wild, type, cells, despite, the, fact, that, the, cyclin, deficient, cells, arrest, at, the, border, between, g, 1, and, s, phase, however, 833, of, the, genes, assayed, changed, behavior, between, the, wild, type, and, mutant, cells, indicating, that, these, genes, are, likely, directly, or, indirectly, regulated, by, the, cdk, cyclin, machinery, some, genes, that, continued, to, be, expressed, on, time, in, the, mutant, cells, were, also, expressed, at, different, levels, in, the, mutant, and, wild, type, cells, these, findings, suggest, that, while, the, transcriptional, network, may, oscillate, independently, of, the, cdk, cyclin, oscillator, they, are, coupled, in, a, manner, that, requires, both, to, ensure, the, proper, timing, of, cell, cycle, events, other, work, indicates, that, phosphorylation, a, post, translational, modification, of, cell, cycle, transcription, factors, by, cdk1, may, alter, the, localization, or, activity, of, the, transcription, factors, in, order, to, tightly, control, timing, of, target, genes, while, oscillatory, transcription, plays, a, key, role, in, the, progression, of, the, yeast, cell, cycle, the, cdk, cyclin, machinery, operates, independently, in, the, early, embryonic, cell, cycle, before, the, midblastula, transition, zygotic, transcription, does, not, occur, and, all, needed, proteins, such, as, the, b, type, cyclins, are, translated, from, maternally, loaded, mrna, analyses, of, synchronized, cultures, of, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, under, conditions, that, prevent, dna, replication, initiation, without, delaying, cell, cycle, progression, showed, that, origin, licensing, decreases, the, expression, of, genes, with, origins, near, their, 3, ends, revealing, that, downstream, origins, can, regulate, the, expression, of, upstream, genes, this, confirms, previous, predictions, from, mathematical, modeling, of, a, global, causal, coordination, between, dna, replication, origin, activity, and, mrna, expression, and, shows, that, mathematical, modeling, of, dna, microarray, data, can, be, used, to, correctly, predict, previously, unknown, biological, modes, of, regulation, cell, cycle, checkpoints, are, used, by, the, cell, to, monitor, and, regulate, the, progress, of, the, cell, cycle, checkpoints, prevent, cell, cycle, progression, at, specific, points, allowing, verification, of, necessary, phase, processes, and, repair, of, dna, damage, the, cell, cannot, proceed, to, the, next, phase, until, checkpoint, requirements, have, been, met, checkpoints, typically, consist, of, a, network, of, regulatory, proteins, that, monitor, and, dictate, the, progression, of, the, cell, through, the, different, stages, of, the, cell, cycle, it, is, estimated, that, in, normal, human, cells, about, 1, of, single, strand, dna, damages, are, converted, to, about, 50, endogenous, dna, double, strand, breaks, per, cell, per, cell, cycle, although, such, double, strand, breaks, are, usually, repaired, with, high, fidelity, errors, in, their, repair, are, considered, to, contribute, significantly, to, the, rate, of, cancer, in, humans, there, are, several, checkpoints, to, ensure, that, damaged, or, incomplete, dna, is, not, passed, on, to, daughter, cells, three, main, checkpoints, exist, the, g, 1, s, checkpoint, the, g, 2, m, checkpoint, and, the, metaphase, mitotic, checkpoint, another, checkpoint, is, the, go, checkpoint, in, which, the, cells, are, checked, for, maturity, if, the, cells, fail, to, pass, this, checkpoint, by, not, being, ready, yet, they, will, be, discarded, from, dividing, g, 1, s, transition, is, a, rate, limiting, step, in, the, cell, cycle, and, is, also, known, as, restriction, point, this, is, where, the, cell, checks, whether, it, has, enough, raw, materials, to, fully, replicate, its, dna, nucleotide, bases, dna, synthase, chromatin, etc, an, unhealthy, or, malnourished, cell, will, get, stuck, at, this, checkpoint, the, g, 2, m, checkpoint, is, where, the, cell, ensures, that, it, has, enough, cytoplasm, and, phospholipids, for, two, daughter, cells, but, sometimes, more, importantly, it, checks, to, see, if, it, is, the, right, time, to, replicate, there, are, some, situations, where, many, cells, need, to, all, replicate, simultaneously, for, example, a, growing, embryo, should, have, a, symmetric, cell, distribution, until, it, reaches, the, mid, blastula, transition, this, is, done, by, controlling, the, g, 2, m, checkpoint, the, metaphase, checkpoint, is, a, fairly, minor, checkpoint, in, that, once, a, cell, is, in, metaphase, it, has, committed, to, undergoing, mitosis, however, that, s, not, to, say, it, isn, t, important, in, this, checkpoint, the, cell, checks, to, ensure, that, the, spindle, has, formed, and, that, all, of, the, chromosomes, are, aligned, at, the, spindle, equator, before, anaphase, begins, while, these, are, the, three, main, checkpoints, not, all, cells, have, to, pass, through, each, of, these, checkpoints, in, this, order, to, replicate, many, types, of, cancer, are, caused, by, mutations, that, allow, the, cells, to, speed, through, the, various, checkpoints, or, even, skip, them, altogether, going, from, s, to, m, to, s, phase, almost, consecutively, because, these, cells, have, lost, their, checkpoints, any, dna, mutations, that, may, have, occurred, are, disregarded, and, passed, on, to, the, daughter, cells, this, is, one, reason, why, cancer, cells, have, a, tendency, to, exponentially, acquire, mutations, aside, from, cancer, cells, many, fully, differentiated, cell, types, no, longer, replicate, so, they, leave, the, cell, cycle, and, stay, in, g, 0, until, their, death, thus, removing, the, need, for, cellular, checkpoints, an, alternative, model, of, the, cell, cycle, response, to, dna, damage, has, also, been, proposed, known, as, the, postreplication, checkpoint, checkpoint, regulation, plays, an, important, role, in, an, organism, s, development, in, sexual, reproduction, when, egg, fertilization, occurs, when, the, sperm, binds, to, the, egg, it, releases, signalling, factors, that, notify, the, egg, that, it, has, been, fertilized, among, other, things, this, induces, the, now, fertilized, oocyte, to, return, from, its, previously, dormant, g, 0, state, back, into, the, cell, cycle, and, on, to, mitotic, replication, and, division, p53, plays, an, important, role, in, triggering, the, control, mechanisms, at, both, g, 1, s, and, g, 2, m, checkpoints, in, addition, to, p53, checkpoint, regulators, are, being, heavily, researched, for, their, roles, in, cancer, growth, and, proliferation, pioneering, work, by, atsushi, miyawaki, and, coworkers, developed, the, fluorescent, ubiquitination, based, cell, cycle, indicator, fucci, which, enables, fluorescence, imaging, of, the, cell, cycle, originally, a, green, fluorescent, protein, mag, was, fused, to, hgem, 1, 110, and, an, orange, fluorescent, protein, mko, 2, was, fused, to, hcdt1, 30, 120, note, these, fusions, are, fragments, that, contain, a, nuclear, localization, signal, and, ubiquitination, sites, for, degradation, but, are, not, functional, proteins, the, green, fluorescent, protein, is, made, during, the, s, g, 2, or, m, phase, and, degraded, during, the, g, 0, or, g, 1, phase, while, the, orange, fluorescent, protein, is, made, during, the, g, 0, or, g, 1, phase, and, destroyed, during, the, s, g, 2, or, m, phase, a, far, red, and, near, infrared, fucci, was, developed, using, a, cyanobacteria, derived, fluorescent, protein, smurfp, and, a, bacteriophytochrome, derived, fluorescent, protein, movie, found, at, this, link, a, disregulation, of, the, cell, cycle, components, may, lead, to, tumor, formation, as, mentioned, above, when, some, genes, like, the, cell, cycle, inhibitors, rb, p53, etc, mutate, they, may, cause, the, cell, to, multiply, uncontrollably, forming, a, tumor, although, the, duration, of, cell, cycle, in, tumor, cells, is, equal, to, or, longer, than, that, of, normal, cell, cycle, the, proportion, of, cells, that, are, in, active, cell, division, versus, quiescent, cells, in, g, 0, phase, in, tumors, is, much, higher, than, that, in, normal, tissue, thus, there, is, a, net, increase, in, cell, number, as, the, number, of, cells, that, die, by, apoptosis, or, senescence, remains, the, same, the, cells, which, are, actively, undergoing, cell, cycle, are, targeted, in, cancer, therapy, as, the, dna, is, relatively, exposed, during, cell, division, and, hence, susceptible, to, damage, by, drugs, or, radiation, this, fact, is, made, use, of, in, cancer, treatment, by, a, process, known, as, debulking, a, significant, mass, of, the, tumor, is, removed, which, pushes, a, significant, number, of, the, remaining, tumor, cells, from, g, 0, to, g, 1, phase, due, to, increased, availability, of, nutrients, oxygen, growth, factors, etc, radiation, or, chemotherapy, following, the, debulking, procedure, kills, these, cells, which, have, newly, entered, the, cell, cycle, the, fastest, cycling, mammalian, cells, in, culture, crypt, cells, in, the, intestinal, epithelium, have, a, cycle, time, as, short, as, 9, to, 10, hours, stem, cells, in, resting, mouse, skin, may, have, a, cycle, time, of, more, than, 200, hours, most, of, this, difference, is, due, to, the, varying, length, of, g, 1, the, most, variable, phase, of, the, cycle, m, and, s, do, not, vary, much, in, general, cells, are, most, radiosensitive, in, late, m, and, g, 2, phases, and, most, resistant, in, late, s, phase, for, cells, with, a, longer, cell, cycle, time, and, a, significantly, long, g, 1, phase, there, is, a, second, peak, of, resistance, late, in, g, 1, the, pattern, of, resistance, and, sensitivity, correlates, with, the, level, of, sulfhydryl, compounds, in, the, cell, sulfhydryls, are, natural, substances, that, protect, cells, from, radiation, damage, and, tend, to, be, at, their, highest, levels, in, s, and, at, their, lowest, near, mitosis, homologous, recombination, hr, is, an, accurate, process, for, repairing, dna, double, strand, breaks, hr, is, nearly, absent, in, g1, phase, is, most, active, in, s, phase, and, declines, in, g, 2, m, non, homologous, end, joining, a, less, accurate, and, more, mutagenic, process, for, repairing, double, strand, breaks, is, active, throughout, the, cell, cycle, the, cell, cycle, must, duplicate, all, cellular, constituents, and, equally, partition, them, into, two, daughter, cells, many, constituents, such, as, proteins, and, ribosomes, are, produced, continuously, throughout, the, cell, cycle, except, during, m, phase, however, the, chromosomes, and, other, associated, elements, like, mtocs, are, duplicated, just, once, during, the, cell, cycle, a, central, component, of, the, cell, cycle, is, its, ability, to, coordinate, the, continuous, and, periodic, duplications, of, different, cellular, elements, which, evolved, with, the, formation, of, the, genome, the, pre, cellular, environment, contained, functional, and, self, replicating, rnas, all, rna, concentrations, depended, on, the, concentrations, of, other, rnas, that, might, be, helping, or, hindering, the, gathering, of, resources, in, this, environment, growth, was, simply, the, continuous, production, of, rnas, these, pre, cellular, structures, would, have, had, to, contend, with, parasitic, rnas, issues, of, inheritance, and, copy, number, control, of, specific, rnas, partitioning, genomic, rna, from, functional, rna, helped, solve, these, problems, the, fusion, of, multiple, rnas, into, a, genome, gave, a, template, from, which, functional, rnas, were, cleaved, now, parasitic, rnas, would, have, to, incorporate, themselves, into, the, genome, a, much, greater, barrier, in, order, to, survive, controlling, the, copy, number, of, genomic, rna, also, allowed, rna, concentration, to, be, determined, through, synthesis, rates, and, rna, half, lives, instead, of, competition, separating, the, duplication, of, genomic, rnas, from, the, generation, of, functional, rnas, allowed, for, much, greater, duplication, fidelity, of, genomic, rnas, without, compromising, the, production, of, functional, rnas, finally, the, replacement, of, genomic, rna, with, dna, which, is, a, more, stable, molecule, allowed, for, larger, genomes, the, transition, from, self, catalysis, enzyme, synthesis, to, genome, directed, enzyme, synthesis, was, a, critical, step, in, cell, evolution, and, had, lasting, implications, on, the, cell, cycle, which, must, regulate, functional, synthesis, and, genomic, duplication, in, very, different, ways, cell, cycle, progression, is, controlled, by, the, oscillating, concentrations, of, different, cyclins, and, the, resulting, molecular, interactions, from, the, various, cyclin, dependent, kinases, cdks, in, yeast, just, one, cdk, cdc28, in, s, cerevisiae, and, cdc2, in, s, pombe, controls, the, cell, cycle, however, in, animals, whole, families, of, cdks, have, evolved, cdk1, controls, entry, to, mitosis, and, cdk2, cdk4, and, cdk6, regulate, entry, into, s, phase, despite, the, evolution, of, the, cdk, family, in, animals, these, proteins, have, related, or, redundant, functions, for, example, cdk2, cdk4, cdk6, triple, knockout, mice, cells, can, still, progress, through, the, basic, cell, cycle, cdk1, knockouts, are, lethal, which, suggests, an, ancestral, cdk1, type, kinase, ultimately, controlling, the, cell, cycle, arabidopsis, thaliana, has, a, cdk1, homolog, called, cdka, 1, however, cdka, 1, a, thaliana, mutants, are, still, viable, running, counter, to, the, opisthokont, pattern, of, cdk1, type, kinases, as, essential, regulators, controlling, the, cell, cycle, plants, also, have, a, unique, group, of, b, type, cdks, whose, functions, may, range, from, development, specific, functions, to, major, players, in, mitotic, regulation, the, g1, s, checkpoint, is, the, point, at, which, the, cell, commits, to, division, through, the, cell, cycle, complex, regulatory, networks, lead, to, the, g1, s, transition, decision, across, opisthokonts, there, are, both, highly, diverged, protein, sequences, as, well, as, strikingly, similar, network, topologies, entry, into, s, phase, in, both, yeast, and, animals, is, controlled, by, the, levels, of, two, opposing, regulators, the, networks, regulating, these, transcription, factors, are, double, negative, feedback, loops, and, positive, feedback, loops, in, both, yeast, and, animals, additional, regulation, of, the, regulatory, network, for, the, g1, s, checkpoint, in, yeast, and, animals, includes, the, phosphorylation, de, phosphorylation, of, cdk, cyclin, complexes, the, sum, of, these, regulatory, networks, creates, a, hysteretic, and, bistable, scheme, despite, the, specific, proteins, being, highly, diverged, for, yeast, whi5, must, be, suppressed, by, cln3, phosphorylation, for, sbf, to, be, expressed, while, in, animals, rb, must, be, suppressed, by, the, cdk4, 6, cyclin, d, complex, for, e2f, to, be, expressed, both, rb, and, whi5, inhibit, transcript, through, the, recruitment, of, histone, deacetylase, proteins, to, promoters, both, proteins, additionally, have, multiple, cdk, phosphorylation, sites, through, which, they, are, inhibited, however, these, proteins, share, no, sequence, similarity, studies, in, a, thaliana, extend, our, knowledge, of, the, g1, s, transition, across, eukaryotes, as, a, whole, plants, also, share, a, number, of, conserved, network, features, with, opisthokonts, and, many, plant, regulators, have, direct, animal, homologs, for, example, plants, also, need, to, suppress, rb, for, e2f, translation, in, the, network, these, conserved, elements, of, the, plant, and, animal, cell, cycles, may, be, ancestral, in, eukaryotes, while, yeast, share, a, conserved, network, topology, with, plants, and, animals, the, highly, diverged, nature, of, yeast, regulators, suggests, possible, rapid, evolution, along, the, yeast, lineage
