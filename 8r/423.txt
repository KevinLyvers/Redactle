odonata, is, an, order, of, predatory, flying, insects, that, includes, the, dragonflies, and, damselflies, the, two, groups, are, distinguished, with, dragonflies, suborder, epiprocta, usually, being, bulkier, with, large, compound, eyes, together, and, wings, spread, up, or, out, at, rest, while, damselflies, suborder, zygoptera, are, usually, more, slender, with, eyes, placed, apart, and, wings, folded, together, along, body, at, rest, adult, odonates, can, land, and, perch, but, rarely, walk, all, odonates, have, aquatic, larvae, called, naiads, or, nymphs, and, all, of, them, larvae, and, adults, are, carnivorous, and, are, almost, entirely, insectivorous, although, at, the, larval, stage, they, will, eat, anything, that, they, can, overpower, including, small, fish, tadpoles, and, even, adult, newts, the, adults, are, superb, aerial, hunters, and, their, legs, are, specialised, for, catching, prey, in, flight, johan, christian, fabricius, coined, the, term, odonata, in, 1793, from, the, ancient, greek, od, n, ionic, form, of, odo, s, tooth, one, hypothesis, is, that, it, was, because, their, maxillae, are, notably, toothed, the, word, dragonfly, usually, denotes, only, anisoptera, but, is, sometimes, used, to, mean, all, odonata, odonata, enthusiasts, avoid, ambiguity, by, using, the, term, true, dragonfly, or, simply, anisopteran, when, they, mean, just, the, anisoptera, an, alternative, term, warriorfly, has, been, proposed, the, largest, living, odonate, is, the, giant, central, american, helicopter, damselfly, megaloprepus, coerulatus, zygoptera, pseudostigmatidae, with, a, wing, span, of, 191, mm, 7, 5, in, the, heaviest, living, odonates, are, tetracanthagyna, plagiata, anisoptera, aeshnidae, with, a, wing, span, of, 165, mm, 6, 5, in, and, petalura, ingentissima, anisoptera, petaluridae, with, a, body, length, of, 117, mm, 4, 6, in, some, sources, 125, mm, 4, 9, in, and, wing, span, of, 160, mm, 6, 3, in, the, longest, extant, odonate, is, the, neotropical, helicopter, damselfly, mecistogaster, linearis, zygoptera, pseudostigmatidae, with, a, body, length, of, 135, mm, 5, 3, in, the, smallest, living, dragonfly, is, nannophya, pygmaea, anisoptera, libellulidae, from, east, asia, with, a, body, length, of, 15, mm, 0, 59, in, and, a, wing, span, of, 20, mm, 0, 79, in, the, smallest, damselflies, and, also, the, smallest, odonates, are, species, of, the, genus, agriocnemis, zygoptera, coenagrionidae, with, a, wing, span, of, only, 17, 18, mm, 0, 67, 0, 71, in, these, insects, characteristically, have, large, rounded, heads, covered, mostly, by, well, developed, compound, eyes, which, provide, good, vision, legs, that, facilitate, catching, prey, other, insects, in, flight, two, pairs, of, long, transparent, wings, that, move, independently, and, elongated, abdomens, they, have, three, ocelli, and, short, antennae, the, mouthparts, are, on, the, underside, of, the, head, and, include, simple, chewing, mandibles, in, the, adult, flight, in, the, odonata, is, direct, with, flight, muscles, attaching, directly, to, the, wings, rather, than, indirect, with, flight, muscles, attaching, to, the, thorax, as, is, found, in, the, neoptera, this, allows, active, control, of, the, amplitude, frequency, angle, of, attack, camber, and, twist, of, each, of, the, four, wings, entirely, independently, in, most, families, there, is, a, structure, on, the, leading, edge, near, the, tip, of, the, wing, called, the, pterostigma, this, is, a, thickened, hemolymph, filled, and, often, colorful, area, bounded, by, veins, the, functions, of, the, pterostigma, are, not, fully, known, but, it, most, probably, has, an, aerodynamic, effect, and, may, also, have, a, visual, function, more, mass, at, the, end, of, the, wing, may, also, reduce, the, energy, needed, to, move, the, wings, up, and, down, the, right, combination, of, wing, stiffness, and, wing, mass, could, reduce, the, energy, consumption, of, flying, a, pterostigma, is, also, found, among, other, insects, such, as, bees, the, nymphs, have, stockier, shorter, bodies, than, the, adults, in, addition, to, lacking, wings, their, eyes, are, smaller, their, antennae, longer, and, their, heads, are, less, mobile, than, in, the, adult, their, mouthparts, are, modified, with, the, labium, being, adapted, into, a, unique, prehensile, organ, called, a, labial, mask, for, grasping, prey, damselfly, nymphs, breathe, through, external, gills, on, the, abdomen, while, dragonfly, nymphs, respire, through, an, organ, in, their, rectum, members, of, the, crown, group, odonata, first, appeared, during, the, late, triassic, though, members, of, their, total, group, odonatoptera, first, appeared, in, the, late, carboniferous, making, them, one, of, the, earliest, groups, of, winged, insects, the, fossils, of, odonates, and, their, cousins, including, paleozoic, giant, dragonflies, like, meganeuropsis, permiana, from, the, permian, of, north, america, reached, wing, spans, of, up, to, 71, cm, 28, in, and, a, body, length, of, 43, cm, 17, in, making, it, the, largest, insect, of, all, time, this, insect, belonged, to, the, order, meganisoptera, the, griffinflies, related, to, odonates, but, not, part, of, the, modern, order, odonata, in, the, restricted, sense, they, have, one, of, the, most, complete, fossil, records, going, back, 319, million, years, the, odonata, is, closely, related, to, mayflies, and, several, extinct, orders, in, a, group, called, the, palaeoptera, but, this, grouping, might, be, paraphyletic, what, they, do, share, with, mayflies, is, the, nature, of, how, the, wings, are, articulated, and, held, in, rest, tarsophlebiidae, is, a, prehistoric, family, of, odonatoptera, that, can, be, considered, either, a, basal, lineage, of, odonata, or, their, immediate, sister, taxon, the, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, orders, and, suborders, of, odonates, according, to, bybee, et, al, 2021, zygoptera, damselflies, anisozygoptera, anisoptera, dragonflies, in, some, treatments, the, odonata, are, understood, in, an, expanded, sense, essentially, synonymous, with, the, superorder, odonatoptera, but, not, including, the, prehistoric, protodonata, in, this, approach, instead, of, odonatoptera, the, term, odonatoidea, is, used, the, systematics, of, the, palaeoptera, are, by, no, means, resolved, what, can, be, said, however, is, that, regardless, of, whether, they, are, called, odonatoidea, or, odonatoptera, the, odonata, and, their, extinct, relatives, do, form, a, clade, the, anisoptera, was, long, treated, as, a, suborder, with, a, third, suborder, the, anisozygoptera, ancient, dragonflies, however, the, combined, suborder, epiprocta, in, which, anisoptera, is, an, infraorder, was, proposed, when, it, was, thought, that, the, anisozygoptera, was, paraphyletic, composed, of, mostly, extinct, offshoots, of, dragonfly, evolution, the, four, living, species, placed, in, that, group, are, in, this, treatment, in, the, infraorder, epiophlebioptera, whereas, the, fossil, taxa, that, were, formerly, there, are, now, dispersed, about, the, odonatoptera, or, odonata, sensu, lato, world, odonata, list, considers, anisoptera, as, a, suborder, along, with, zygoptera, and, anisozygoptera, as, well, understood, and, widely, preferred, terms, odonates, are, aquatic, or, semi, aquatic, as, juveniles, thus, adults, are, most, often, seen, near, bodies, of, water, and, are, frequently, described, as, aquatic, insects, however, many, species, range, far, from, water, they, are, carnivorous, or, more, specifically, insectivorous, throughout, their, life, mostly, feeding, on, smaller, insects, male, odonata, have, complex, genitalia, different, from, those, found, in, other, insects, these, include, grasping, cerci, at, the, tip, of, the, abdomen, for, holding, the, female, and, a, secondary, set, of, copulatory, organs, located, between, the, second, and, third, abdominal, segment, in, which, the, spermatozoa, are, stored, after, being, produced, by, the, primary, genitals, whose, external, opening, is, known, as, the, genital, pore, on, the, ninth, abdominal, segment, this, process, is, called, intra, male, sperm, translocation, st, because, the, male, copulatory, organ, has, evolved, independently, from, that, in, other, insects, it, has, been, suggested, the, stem, group, dragonflies, had, external, sperm, transfer, to, mate, the, male, claspers, grasps, the, female, by, the, thorax, zygoptera, or, head, anisoptera, while, the, female, bends, her, abdomen, so, that, her, own, genitalia, can, be, grasped, by, the, copulatory, organ, holding, the, sperm, this, is, known, as, the, wheel, position, eggs, are, laid, in, water, or, on, vegetation, near, water, or, wet, places, and, hatch, to, produce, pronymphs, which, live, off, the, nutrients, that, were, in, the, egg, they, then, develop, into, instars, with, approximately, 9, 14, molts, that, are, in, most, species, voracious, predators, on, other, aquatic, organisms, including, small, fishes, the, nymphs, grow, and, molt, usually, in, dusk, or, dawn, into, the, flying, teneral, immature, adults, whose, color, is, not, yet, developed, these, transform, into, reproductive, adults, odonates, can, act, as, bioindicators, of, water, quality, in, rivers, because, they, rely, on, high, quality, water, for, proper, development, in, early, life, since, their, diet, consists, entirely, of, insects, odonate, density, is, directly, proportional, to, the, population, of, prey, and, their, abundance, indicates, the, abundance, of, prey, in, the, examined, ecosystem, species, richness, of, vascular, plants, has, also, been, positively, correlated, with, the, species, richness, of, dragonflies, in, a, given, habitat, this, means, that, in, a, location, such, as, a, lake, if, one, finds, a, wide, variety, of, odonates, then, a, similarly, wide, variety, of, plants, should, also, be, present, this, correlation, is, not, common, to, all, bioindicators, as, some, may, act, as, indicators, for, a, different, environmental, factor, such, as, the, pool, frog, acting, as, a, bioindicator, of, water, quality, due, to, its, high, quantity, of, time, spent, in, and, around, water, in, addition, odonates, are, very, sensitive, to, changes, to, average, temperature, many, species, have, moved, to, higher, elevations, and, latitudes, as, global, temperature, rises, and, habitats, dry, out, changes, to, the, life, cycle, have, been, recorded, with, increased, development, of, the, instar, stages, and, smaller, adult, body, size, as, the, average, temperature, increases, as, the, territory, of, many, species, starts, to, overlap, the, rate, hybridization, of, species, that, normally, do, not, come, in, contact, is, increasing, if, global, climate, change, continues, many, members, of, odonata, will, start, to, disappear, because, odonates, are, such, an, old, order, and, have, such, a, complete, fossil, record, they, are, an, ideal, species, to, study, insect, evolution, and, adaptation, for, example, they, are, one, of, the, first, insects, to, develop, flight, and, it, is, likely, that, this, trait, only, evolved, once, in, insects, looking, at, how, flight, works, in, odonates, the, rest, of, flight, can, be, mapped, out, various, lists, of, odonata, species, of, different, regions
