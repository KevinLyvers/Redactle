typha, t, a, f, is, a, genus, of, about, 30, species, of, monocotyledonous, flowering, plants, in, the, family, typhaceae, these, plants, have, a, variety, of, common, names, in, british, english, as, bulrush, or, mainly, historically, reedmace, in, american, english, as, cattail, or, punks, in, australia, as, cumbungi, or, bulrush, in, canada, as, bulrush, or, cattail, and, in, new, zealand, as, reed, cattail, bulrush, or, raupo, other, taxa, of, plants, may, be, known, as, bulrush, including, some, sedges, in, scirpus, and, related, genera, the, genus, is, largely, distributed, in, the, northern, hemisphere, where, it, is, found, in, a, variety, of, wetland, habitats, the, rhizomes, are, edible, though, at, least, some, species, are, known, to, accumulate, toxins, and, so, must, first, undergo, treatment, before, being, eaten, evidence, of, preserved, starch, grains, on, grinding, stones, suggests, they, were, already, eaten, in, europe, 30, 000, years, ago, typha, are, aquatic, or, semi, aquatic, rhizomatous, herbaceous, perennial, plants, 925, the, leaves, are, glabrous, hairless, linear, alternate, and, mostly, basal, on, a, simple, jointless, stem, that, bears, the, flowering, spikes, the, plants, are, monoecious, with, unisexual, flowers, that, develop, in, dense, racemes, the, numerous, male, flowers, form, a, narrow, spike, at, the, top, of, the, vertical, stem, each, male, staminate, flower, is, reduced, to, a, pair, of, stamens, and, hairs, and, withers, once, the, pollen, is, shed, large, numbers, of, tiny, female, flowers, form, a, dense, sausage, shaped, spike, on, the, stem, below, the, male, spike, in, larger, species, this, can, be, up, to, 30, centimetres, 12, in, long, and, 1, to, 4, centimetres, 0, 4, to, 2, in, thick, the, seeds, are, minute, 0, 2, millimetres, 0, 008, in, long, and, attached, to, fine, hairs, when, ripe, the, heads, disintegrate, into, a, cottony, fluff, from, which, the, seeds, disperse, by, wind, fruits, of, typha, have, been, found, as, long, ago, as, 69, mya, in, modern, central, europe, typha, are, often, among, the, first, wetland, plants, to, colonize, areas, of, newly, exposed, wet, mud, with, their, abundant, wind, dispersed, seeds, buried, seeds, can, survive, in, the, soil, for, long, periods, of, time, they, germinate, best, with, sunlight, and, fluctuating, temperatures, which, is, typical, of, many, wetland, plants, that, regenerate, on, mud, flats, the, plants, also, spread, by, rhizomes, forming, large, interconnected, stands, typha, are, considered, to, be, dominant, competitors, in, wetlands, in, many, areas, and, they, often, exclude, other, plants, with, their, dense, canopy, in, the, bays, of, the, great, lakes, for, example, they, are, among, the, most, abundant, wetland, plants, different, species, of, cattails, are, adapted, to, different, water, depths, well, developed, aerenchyma, make, the, plants, tolerant, of, submersion, even, the, dead, stalks, are, capable, of, transmitting, oxygen, to, the, rooting, zone, although, typha, are, native, wetland, plants, they, can, be, aggressive, in, their, competition, with, other, native, species, they, have, been, problematic, in, many, regions, in, north, america, from, the, great, lakes, to, the, everglades, native, sedges, are, displaced, and, wet, meadows, shrink, likely, as, a, response, to, altered, hydrology, of, the, wetlands, and, increased, nutrient, levels, an, introduced, or, hybrid, species, may, be, contributing, to, the, problem, control, is, difficult, the, most, successful, strategy, appears, to, be, mowing, or, burning, to, remove, the, aerenchymous, stalks, followed, by, prolonged, flooding, it, may, be, more, important, to, prevent, invasion, by, preserving, water, level, fluctuations, including, periods, of, drought, and, to, maintain, infertile, conditions, typha, are, frequently, eaten, by, wetland, mammals, such, as, muskrats, which, also, use, them, to, construct, feeding, platforms, and, dens, thereby, also, providing, nesting, and, resting, places, for, waterfowl, the, following, species, and, hybrids, are, currently, accepted, the, most, widespread, species, is, typha, latifolia, which, is, distributed, across, the, entire, temperate, northern, hemisphere, it, has, also, been, introduced, to, australia, t, angustifolia, is, nearly, as, widespread, but, does, not, extend, as, far, north, it, may, be, introduced, and, invasive, in, north, america, t, domingensis, has, a, more, southern, american, distribution, and, it, occurs, in, australia, t, orientalis, is, widespread, in, asia, australia, and, new, zealand, t, laxmannii, t, minima, and, t, shuttleworthii, are, largely, restricted, to, asia, and, southern, europe, many, parts, of, the, typha, plant, are, edible, to, humans, before, the, plant, flowers, the, tender, inside, of, the, shoots, can, be, squeezed, out, and, eaten, raw, or, cooked, the, starchy, rhizomes, are, nutritious, with, a, protein, content, comparable, to, that, of, maize, or, rice, they, can, be, processed, into, a, flour, with, 266, kcal, per, 100, grams, and, are, most, often, harvested, from, late, autumn, to, early, spring, they, are, fibrous, and, the, starch, must, be, scraped, or, sucked, from, the, tough, fibers, baby, shoots, emerging, from, the, rhizomes, which, are, sometimes, subterranean, can, be, picked, and, eaten, raw, also, underground, is, a, carbohydrate, lump, which, can, be, peeled, and, eaten, raw, or, cooked, like, a, potato, the, plant, is, one, championed, by, survival, experts, because, various, parts, can, be, eaten, throughout, the, year, plants, growing, in, polluted, water, can, accumulate, lead, and, pesticide, residues, in, their, rhizomes, and, these, should, not, be, eaten, the, rind, of, young, stems, can, be, peeled, off, and, the, tender, white, heart, inside, can, be, eaten, raw, or, boiled, and, eaten, like, asparagus, this, food, has, been, popular, among, the, cossacks, in, russia, and, has, been, called, cossack, asparagus, the, leaf, bases, can, be, eaten, raw, or, cooked, especially, in, late, spring, when, they, are, young, and, tender, in, early, summer, the, sheath, can, be, removed, from, the, developing, green, flower, spike, which, can, then, be, boiled, and, eaten, like, corn, on, the, cob, in, mid, summer, when, the, male, flowers, are, mature, the, pollen, can, be, collected, and, used, as, a, flour, supplement, or, thickener, the, seeds, have, a, high, linoleic, acid, content, and, can, be, used, to, feed, cattle, and, chickens, they, can, also, be, found, in, african, countries, like, ghana, harvesting, cattail, removes, nutrients, from, the, wetland, that, would, otherwise, return, via, the, decomposition, of, decaying, plant, matter, floating, mats, of, cattails, remove, nutrients, from, eutrophied, bodies, of, freshwater, for, local, native, tribes, around, lake, titicaca, in, peru, and, bolivia, typha, were, among, the, most, important, plants, and, every, part, of, the, plant, had, multiple, uses, for, example, they, were, used, to, construct, rafts, and, other, boats, during, world, war, ii, the, united, states, navy, used, the, down, of, typha, as, a, substitute, for, kapok, in, life, vests, and, aviation, jackets, tests, showed, that, even, after, 100, hours, of, submersion, the, buoyancy, was, still, effective, typha, are, used, as, thermal, insulation, in, buildings, as, an, organic, alternative, to, conventional, insulating, materials, such, as, glass, wool, or, stone, wool, typha, stems, and, leaves, can, be, used, to, make, paper, it, is, strong, with, a, heavy, texture, and, it, is, hard, to, bleach, so, it, is, not, suitable, for, industrial, production, of, graphical, paper, in, 1853, considerable, amounts, of, cattail, paper, were, produced, in, new, york, due, to, a, shortage, of, raw, materials, in, 1948, french, scientists, tested, methods, for, annual, harvesting, of, the, leaves, because, of, the, high, cost, these, methods, were, abandoned, and, no, further, research, was, done, today, typha, is, used, to, make, decorative, paper, fibers, up, to, 4, meters, long, can, be, obtained, from, the, stems, when, they, are, treated, mechanically, or, chemically, with, sodium, hydroxide, the, stem, fibers, resemble, jute, and, can, be, used, to, produce, raw, textiles, the, leaf, fibers, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, cotton, and, linen, in, clothing, the, yield, of, leaf, fiber, is, 30, to, 40, percent, and, typha, glauca, can, produce, 7, to, 10, tons, per, hectare, annually, typha, can, be, used, as, a, source, of, starch, to, produce, ethanol, because, of, their, high, productivity, in, northern, latitudes, typha, are, considered, to, be, a, bioenergy, crop, the, seed, hairs, were, used, by, some, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, as, tinder, for, starting, fires, some, tribes, also, used, typha, down, to, line, moccasins, and, for, bedding, diapers, baby, powder, and, cradleboards, one, native, american, word, for, typha, meant, fruit, for, papoose, s, bed, typha, down, is, still, used, in, some, areas, to, stuff, clothing, items, and, pillows, typha, can, be, dipped, in, wax, or, fat, and, then, lit, as, a, candle, the, stem, serving, as, a, wick, without, the, use, of, wax, or, fat, it, will, smolder, slowly, somewhat, like, incense, and, may, repel, insects, the, flower, stalks, can, be, made, into, chopsticks, the, leaves, can, be, treated, to, weave, into, baskets, mats, or, sandals, the, rushes, are, harvested, and, the, leaves, often, dried, for, later, use, in, chair, seats, re, wetted, the, leaves, are, twisted, and, wrapped, around, the, chair, rungs, to, form, a, densely, woven, seat, that, is, then, stuffed, usually, with, the, left, over, rush, small, scale, experiments, have, indicated, that, typha, are, able, to, remove, arsenic, from, drinking, water, the, boiled, rootstocks, have, been, used, as, a, diuretic, for, increasing, urination, or, mashed, to, make, a, jelly, like, paste, for, sores, boils, wounds, burns, scabs, and, smallpox, pustules, cattail, pollen, is, used, as, a, banker, source, of, food, for, predatory, insects, and, mites, such, as, amblyseius, swirskii, in, greenhouses, the, cattail, or, as, it, is, commonly, referred, to, in, the, american, midwest, the, sausage, tail, has, been, the, subject, of, multiple, artist, renditions, gaining, popularity, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, the, term, sausage, tail, derives, from, the, similarity, that, cattails, have, with, sausages, a, name, given, to, the, plant, by, the, midwest, polish, community, who, had, noticed, a, striking, similarity, between, the, plant, and, a, common, polish, dish, kie, basa
