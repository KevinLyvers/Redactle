thermoregulation, is, the, ability, of, an, organism, to, keep, its, body, temperature, within, certain, boundaries, even, when, the, surrounding, temperature, is, very, different, a, thermoconforming, organism, by, contrast, simply, adopts, the, surrounding, temperature, as, its, own, body, temperature, thus, avoiding, the, need, for, internal, thermoregulation, the, internal, thermoregulation, process, is, one, aspect, of, homeostasis, a, state, of, dynamic, stability, in, an, organism, s, internal, conditions, maintained, far, from, thermal, equilibrium, with, its, environment, the, study, of, such, processes, in, zoology, has, been, called, physiological, ecology, if, the, body, is, unable, to, maintain, a, normal, temperature, and, it, increases, significantly, above, normal, a, condition, known, as, hyperthermia, occurs, humans, may, also, experience, lethal, hyperthermia, when, the, wet, bulb, temperature, is, sustained, above, 35, c, 95, f, for, six, hours, work, in, 2022, established, by, experiment, that, a, wet, bulb, temperature, exceeding, 30, 55, c, caused, uncompensable, heat, stress, in, young, healthy, adult, humans, the, opposite, condition, when, body, temperature, decreases, below, normal, levels, is, known, as, hypothermia, it, results, when, the, homeostatic, control, mechanisms, of, heat, within, the, body, malfunction, causing, the, body, to, lose, heat, faster, than, producing, it, normal, body, temperature, is, around, 37, c, 98, 6, f, and, hypothermia, sets, in, when, the, core, body, temperature, gets, lower, than, 35, c, 95, f, usually, caused, by, prolonged, exposure, to, cold, temperatures, hypothermia, is, usually, treated, by, methods, that, attempt, to, raise, the, body, temperature, back, to, a, normal, range, it, was, not, until, the, introduction, of, thermometers, that, any, exact, data, on, the, temperature, of, animals, could, be, obtained, it, was, then, found, that, local, differences, were, present, since, heat, production, and, heat, loss, vary, considerably, in, different, parts, of, the, body, although, the, circulation, of, the, blood, tends, to, bring, about, a, mean, temperature, of, the, internal, parts, hence, it, is, important, to, identify, the, parts, of, the, body, that, most, closely, reflect, the, temperature, of, the, internal, organs, also, for, such, results, to, be, comparable, the, measurements, must, be, conducted, under, comparable, conditions, the, rectum, has, traditionally, been, considered, to, reflect, most, accurately, the, temperature, of, internal, parts, or, in, some, cases, of, sex, or, species, the, vagina, uterus, or, bladder, some, animals, undergo, one, of, various, forms, of, dormancy, where, the, thermoregulation, process, temporarily, allows, the, body, temperature, to, drop, thereby, conserving, energy, examples, include, hibernating, bears, and, torpor, in, bats, thermoregulation, in, organisms, runs, along, a, spectrum, from, endothermy, to, ectothermy, endotherms, create, most, of, their, heat, via, metabolic, processes, and, are, colloquially, referred, to, as, warm, blooded, when, the, surrounding, temperatures, are, cold, endotherms, increase, metabolic, heat, production, to, keep, their, body, temperature, constant, thus, making, the, internal, body, temperature, of, an, endotherm, more, or, less, independent, of, the, temperature, of, the, environment, endotherms, possess, a, larger, number, of, mitochondria, per, cell, than, ectotherms, enabling, them, to, generate, more, heat, by, increasing, the, rate, at, which, they, metabolize, fats, and, sugars, ectotherms, use, external, sources, of, temperature, to, regulate, their, body, temperatures, they, are, colloquially, referred, to, as, cold, blooded, despite, the, fact, that, body, temperatures, often, stay, within, the, same, temperature, ranges, as, warm, blooded, animals, ectotherms, are, the, opposite, of, endotherms, when, it, comes, to, regulating, internal, temperatures, in, ectotherms, the, internal, physiological, sources, of, heat, are, of, negligible, importance, the, biggest, factor, that, enables, them, to, maintain, adequate, body, temperatures, is, due, to, environmental, influences, living, in, areas, that, maintain, a, constant, temperature, throughout, the, year, like, the, tropics, or, the, ocean, has, enabled, ectotherms, to, develop, behavioral, mechanisms, that, respond, to, external, temperatures, such, as, sun, bathing, to, increase, body, temperature, or, seeking, the, cover, of, shade, to, lower, body, temperature, to, cope, with, low, temperatures, some, fish, have, developed, the, ability, to, remain, functional, even, when, the, water, temperature, is, below, freezing, some, use, natural, antifreeze, or, antifreeze, proteins, to, resist, ice, crystal, formation, in, their, tissues, amphibians, and, reptiles, cope, with, heat, gain, by, evaporative, cooling, and, behavioral, adaptations, an, example, of, behavioral, adaptation, is, that, of, a, lizard, lying, in, the, sun, on, a, hot, rock, in, order, to, heat, through, radiation, and, conduction, an, endotherm, is, an, animal, that, regulates, its, own, body, temperature, typically, by, keeping, it, at, a, constant, level, to, regulate, body, temperature, an, organism, may, need, to, prevent, heat, gains, in, arid, environments, evaporation, of, water, either, across, respiratory, surfaces, or, across, the, skin, in, those, animals, possessing, sweat, glands, helps, in, cooling, body, temperature, to, within, the, organism, s, tolerance, range, animals, with, a, body, covered, by, fur, have, limited, ability, to, sweat, relying, heavily, on, panting, to, increase, evaporation, of, water, across, the, moist, surfaces, of, the, lungs, and, the, tongue, and, mouth, mammals, like, cats, dogs, and, pigs, rely, on, panting, or, other, means, for, thermal, regulation, and, have, sweat, glands, only, in, foot, pads, and, snout, the, sweat, produced, on, pads, of, paws, and, on, palms, and, soles, mostly, serves, to, increase, friction, and, enhance, grip, birds, also, counteract, overheating, by, gular, fluttering, or, rapid, vibrations, of, the, gular, throat, skin, down, feathers, trap, warm, air, acting, as, excellent, insulators, just, as, hair, in, mammals, acts, as, a, good, insulator, mammalian, skin, is, much, thicker, than, that, of, birds, and, often, has, a, continuous, layer, of, insulating, fat, beneath, the, dermis, in, marine, mammals, such, as, whales, or, animals, that, live, in, very, cold, regions, such, as, the, polar, bears, this, is, called, blubber, dense, coats, found, in, desert, endotherms, also, aid, in, preventing, heat, gain, such, as, in, the, case, of, the, camels, a, cold, weather, strategy, is, to, temporarily, decrease, metabolic, rate, decreasing, the, temperature, difference, between, the, animal, and, the, air, and, thereby, minimizing, heat, loss, furthermore, having, a, lower, metabolic, rate, is, less, energetically, expensive, many, animals, survive, cold, frosty, nights, through, torpor, a, short, term, temporary, drop, in, body, temperature, organisms, when, presented, with, the, problem, of, regulating, body, temperature, have, not, only, behavioural, physiological, and, structural, adaptations, but, also, a, feedback, system, to, trigger, these, adaptations, to, regulate, temperature, accordingly, the, main, features, of, this, system, are, stimulus, receptor, modulator, effector, and, then, the, feedback, of, the, newly, adjusted, temperature, to, the, stimulus, this, cyclical, process, aids, in, homeostasis, homeothermy, and, poikilothermy, refer, to, how, stable, an, organism, s, deep, body, temperature, is, most, endothermic, organisms, are, homeothermic, like, mammals, however, animals, with, facultative, endothermy, are, often, poikilothermic, meaning, their, temperature, can, vary, considerably, most, fish, are, ectotherms, as, most, of, their, heat, comes, from, the, surrounding, water, however, almost, all, fish, are, poikilothermic, the, physiology, of, the, dendroctonus, micans, beetle, encompasses, a, suite, of, adaptations, crucial, for, its, survival, and, reproduction, flight, capabilities, enable, them, to, disperse, and, locate, new, host, trees, while, sensory, organs, aid, in, detecting, environmental, cues, and, food, sources, of, particular, importance, is, their, ability, to, thermoregulate, ensuring, optimal, body, temperature, in, fluctuating, forest, conditions, this, physiological, mechanism, coupled, with, thermosensation, allows, them, to, thrive, across, diverse, environments, overall, these, adaptations, underscore, the, beetle, s, remarkable, resilience, and, highlight, the, significance, of, understanding, their, physiology, for, effective, management, and, conservation, efforts, by, numerous, observations, upon, humans, and, other, animals, john, hunter, showed, that, the, essential, difference, between, the, so, called, warm, blooded, and, cold, blooded, animals, lies, in, observed, constancy, of, the, temperature, of, the, former, and, the, observed, variability, of, the, temperature, of, the, latter, almost, all, birds, and, mammals, have, a, high, temperature, almost, constant, and, independent, of, that, of, the, surrounding, air, homeothermy, almost, all, other, animals, display, a, variation, of, body, temperature, dependent, on, their, surroundings, poikilothermy, thermoregulation, in, both, ectotherms, and, endotherms, is, controlled, mainly, by, the, preoptic, area, of, the, anterior, hypothalamus, such, homeostatic, control, is, separate, from, the, sensation, of, temperature, in, cold, environments, birds, and, mammals, employ, the, following, adaptations, and, strategies, to, minimize, heat, loss, in, warm, environments, birds, and, mammals, employ, the, following, adaptations, and, strategies, to, maximize, heat, loss, in, humans, as, in, other, mammals, thermoregulation, is, an, important, aspect, of, human, homeostasis, most, body, heat, is, generated, in, the, deep, organs, especially, the, liver, brain, and, heart, and, in, contraction, of, skeletal, muscles, humans, have, been, able, to, adapt, to, a, great, diversity, of, climates, including, hot, humid, and, hot, arid, high, temperatures, pose, serious, stresses, for, the, human, body, placing, it, in, great, danger, of, injury, or, even, death, for, example, one, of, the, most, common, reactions, to, hot, temperatures, is, heat, exhaustion, which, is, an, illness, that, could, happen, if, one, is, exposed, to, high, temperatures, resulting, in, some, symptoms, such, as, dizziness, fainting, or, a, rapid, heartbeat, for, humans, adaptation, to, varying, climatic, conditions, includes, both, physiological, mechanisms, resulting, from, evolution, and, behavioural, mechanisms, resulting, from, conscious, cultural, adaptations, the, physiological, control, of, the, body, s, core, temperature, takes, place, primarily, through, the, hypothalamus, which, assumes, the, role, as, the, body, s, thermostat, this, organ, possesses, control, mechanisms, as, well, as, key, temperature, sensors, which, are, connected, to, nerve, cells, called, thermoreceptors, thermoreceptors, come, in, two, subcategories, ones, that, respond, to, cold, temperatures, and, ones, that, respond, to, warm, temperatures, scattered, throughout, the, body, in, both, peripheral, and, central, nervous, systems, these, nerve, cells, are, sensitive, to, changes, in, temperature, and, are, able, to, provide, useful, information, to, the, hypothalamus, through, the, process, of, negative, feedback, thus, maintaining, a, constant, core, temperature, there, are, four, avenues, of, heat, loss, evaporation, convection, conduction, and, radiation, if, skin, temperature, is, greater, than, that, of, the, surrounding, air, temperature, the, body, can, lose, heat, by, convection, and, conduction, however, if, air, temperature, of, the, surroundings, is, greater, than, that, of, the, skin, the, body, gains, heat, by, convection, and, conduction, in, such, conditions, the, only, means, by, which, the, body, can, rid, itself, of, heat, is, by, evaporation, so, when, the, surrounding, temperature, is, higher, than, the, skin, temperature, anything, that, prevents, adequate, evaporation, will, cause, the, internal, body, temperature, to, rise, during, intense, physical, activity, e, g, sports, evaporation, becomes, the, main, avenue, of, heat, loss, humidity, affects, thermoregulation, by, limiting, sweat, evaporation, and, thus, heat, loss, thermoregulation, is, also, an, integral, part, of, a, reptile, s, life, specifically, lizards, such, as, microlophus, occipitalis, and, ctenophorus, decresii, who, must, change, microhabitats, to, keep, a, constant, body, temperature, by, moving, to, cooler, areas, when, it, is, too, hot, and, to, warmer, areas, when, it, is, cold, they, can, thermoregulate, their, temperature, to, stay, within, their, necessary, bounds, thermogenesis, occurs, in, the, flowers, of, many, plants, in, the, family, araceae, as, well, as, in, cycad, cones, in, addition, the, sacred, lotus, nelumbo, nucifera, is, able, to, thermoregulate, itself, remaining, on, average, 20, c, 36, f, above, air, temperature, while, flowering, heat, is, produced, by, breaking, down, the, starch, that, was, stored, in, their, roots, which, requires, the, consumption, of, oxygen, at, a, rate, approaching, that, of, a, flying, hummingbird, one, possible, explanation, for, plant, thermoregulation, is, to, provide, protection, against, cold, temperature, for, example, the, skunk, cabbage, is, not, frost, resistant, yet, it, begins, to, grow, and, flower, when, there, is, still, snow, on, the, ground, another, theory, is, that, thermogenicity, helps, attract, pollinators, which, is, borne, out, by, observations, that, heat, production, is, accompanied, by, the, arrival, of, beetles, or, flies, some, plants, are, known, to, protect, themselves, against, colder, temperatures, using, antifreeze, proteins, this, occurs, in, wheat, triticum, aestivum, potatoes, solanum, tuberosum, and, several, other, angiosperm, species, animals, other, than, humans, regulate, and, maintain, their, body, temperature, with, physiological, adjustments, and, behavior, desert, lizards, are, ectotherms, and, therefore, are, unable, to, regulate, their, internal, temperature, themselves, to, regulate, their, internal, temperature, many, lizards, relocate, themselves, to, a, more, environmentally, favorable, location, they, may, do, this, in, the, morning, only, by, raising, their, head, from, its, burrow, and, then, exposing, their, entire, body, by, basking, in, the, sun, the, lizard, absorbs, solar, heat, it, may, also, absorb, heat, by, conduction, from, heated, rocks, that, have, stored, radiant, solar, energy, to, lower, their, temperature, lizards, exhibit, varied, behaviors, sand, seas, or, ergs, produce, up, to, 57, 7, c, 135, 9, f, and, the, sand, lizard, will, hold, its, feet, up, in, the, air, to, cool, down, seek, cooler, objects, with, which, to, contact, find, shade, or, return, to, its, burrow, they, also, go, to, their, burrows, to, avoid, cooling, when, the, temperature, falls, aquatic, animals, can, also, regulate, their, temperature, behaviorally, by, changing, their, position, in, the, thermal, gradient, sprawling, prone, in, a, cool, shady, spot, splooting, has, been, observed, in, squirrels, on, hot, days, animals, also, engage, in, kleptothermy, in, which, they, share, or, steal, each, other, s, body, warmth, kleptothermy, is, observed, particularly, amongst, juveniles, in, endotherms, such, as, bats, and, birds, such, as, the, mousebird, and, emperor, penguin, this, allows, the, individuals, to, increase, their, thermal, inertia, as, with, gigantothermy, and, so, reduce, heat, loss, some, ectotherms, share, burrows, of, ectotherms, other, animals, exploit, termite, mounds, some, animals, living, in, cold, environments, maintain, their, body, temperature, by, preventing, heat, loss, their, fur, grows, more, densely, to, increase, the, amount, of, insulation, some, animals, are, regionally, heterothermic, and, are, able, to, allow, their, less, insulated, extremities, to, cool, to, temperatures, much, lower, than, their, core, temperature, nearly, to, 0, c, 32, f, this, minimizes, heat, loss, through, less, insulated, body, parts, like, the, legs, feet, or, hooves, and, nose, different, species, of, drosophila, found, in, the, sonoran, desert, will, exploit, different, species, of, cacti, based, on, the, thermotolerance, differences, between, species, and, hosts, for, example, drosophila, mettleri, is, found, in, cacti, like, the, saguaro, and, senita, these, two, cacti, remain, cool, by, storing, water, over, time, the, genes, selecting, for, higher, heat, tolerance, were, reduced, in, the, population, due, to, the, cooler, host, climate, the, fly, is, able, to, exploit, some, flies, such, as, lucilia, sericata, lay, their, eggs, en, masse, the, resulting, group, of, larvae, depending, on, its, size, is, able, to, thermoregulate, and, keep, itself, at, the, optimum, temperature, for, development, koalas, also, can, behaviorally, thermoregulate, by, seeking, out, cooler, portions, of, trees, on, hot, days, they, preferentially, wrap, themselves, around, the, coolest, portions, of, trees, typically, near, the, bottom, to, increase, their, passive, radiation, of, internal, body, heat, to, cope, with, limited, food, resources, and, low, temperatures, some, mammals, hibernate, during, cold, periods, to, remain, in, stasis, for, long, periods, these, animals, build, up, brown, fat, reserves, and, slow, all, body, functions, true, hibernators, e, g, groundhogs, keep, their, body, temperatures, low, throughout, hibernation, whereas, the, core, temperature, of, false, hibernators, e, g, bears, varies, occasionally, the, animal, may, emerge, from, its, den, for, brief, periods, some, bats, are, true, hibernators, and, rely, upon, a, rapid, non, shivering, thermogenesis, of, their, brown, fat, deposit, to, bring, them, out, of, hibernation, estivation, is, similar, to, hibernation, however, it, usually, occurs, in, hot, periods, to, allow, animals, to, avoid, high, temperatures, and, desiccation, both, terrestrial, and, aquatic, invertebrate, and, vertebrates, enter, into, estivation, examples, include, lady, beetles, coccinellidae, north, american, desert, tortoises, crocodiles, salamanders, cane, toads, and, the, water, holding, frog, daily, torpor, occurs, in, small, endotherms, like, bats, and, hummingbirds, which, temporarily, reduces, their, high, metabolic, rates, to, conserve, energy, previously, average, oral, temperature, for, healthy, adults, had, been, considered, 37, 0, c, 98, 6, f, while, normal, ranges, are, 36, 1, to, 37, 8, c, 97, 0, to, 100, 0, f, in, poland, and, russia, the, temperature, had, been, measured, axillarily, under, the, arm, 36, 6, c, 97, 9, f, was, considered, ideal, temperature, in, these, countries, while, normal, ranges, are, 36, 0, to, 36, 9, c, 96, 8, to, 98, 4, f, recent, studies, suggest, that, the, average, temperature, for, healthy, adults, is, 36, 8, c, 98, 2, f, same, result, in, three, different, studies, variations, one, standard, deviation, from, three, other, studies, are, measured, temperature, varies, according, to, thermometer, placement, with, rectal, temperature, being, 0, 3, 0, 6, c, 0, 5, 1, 1, f, higher, than, oral, temperature, while, axillary, temperature, is, 0, 3, 0, 6, c, 0, 5, 1, 1, f, lower, than, oral, temperature, the, average, difference, between, oral, and, axillary, temperatures, of, indian, children, aged, 6, 12, was, found, to, be, only, 0, 1, c, standard, deviation, 0, 2, c, and, the, mean, difference, in, maltese, children, aged, 4, 14, between, oral, and, axillary, temperature, was, 0, 56, c, while, the, mean, difference, between, rectal, and, axillary, temperature, for, children, under, 4, years, old, was, 0, 38, c, in, humans, a, diurnal, variation, has, been, observed, dependent, on, the, periods, of, rest, and, activity, lowest, at, 11, p, m, to, 3, a, m, and, peaking, at, 10, a, m, to, 6, p, m, monkeys, also, have, a, well, marked, and, regular, diurnal, variation, of, body, temperature, that, follows, periods, of, rest, and, activity, and, is, not, dependent, on, the, incidence, of, day, and, night, nocturnal, monkeys, reach, their, highest, body, temperature, at, night, and, lowest, during, the, day, sutherland, simpson, and, j, j, galbraith, observed, that, all, nocturnal, animals, and, birds, whose, periods, of, rest, and, activity, are, naturally, reversed, through, habit, and, not, from, outside, interference, experience, their, highest, temperature, during, the, natural, period, of, activity, night, and, lowest, during, the, period, of, rest, day, those, diurnal, temperatures, can, be, reversed, by, reversing, their, daily, routine, in, essence, the, temperature, curve, of, diurnal, birds, is, similar, to, that, of, humans, and, other, homeothermic, animals, except, that, the, maximum, occurs, earlier, in, the, afternoon, and, the, minimum, earlier, in, the, morning, also, the, curves, obtained, from, rabbits, guinea, pigs, and, dogs, were, quite, similar, to, those, from, humans, these, observations, indicate, that, body, temperature, is, partially, regulated, by, circadian, rhythms, during, the, follicular, phase, which, lasts, from, the, first, day, of, menstruation, until, the, day, of, ovulation, the, average, basal, body, temperature, in, women, ranges, from, 36, 45, to, 36, 7, c, 97, 61, to, 98, 06, f, within, 24, hours, of, ovulation, women, experience, an, elevation, of, 0, 15, 0, 45, c, 0, 27, 0, 81, f, due, to, the, increased, metabolic, rate, caused, by, sharply, elevated, levels, of, progesterone, the, basal, body, temperature, ranges, between, 36, 7, 37, 3, c, 98, 1, 99, 1, f, throughout, the, luteal, phase, and, drops, down, to, pre, ovulatory, levels, within, a, few, days, of, menstruation, women, can, chart, this, phenomenon, to, determine, whether, and, when, they, are, ovulating, so, as, to, aid, conception, or, contraception, fever, is, a, regulated, elevation, of, the, set, point, of, core, temperature, in, the, hypothalamus, caused, by, circulating, pyrogens, produced, by, the, immune, system, to, the, subject, a, rise, in, core, temperature, due, to, fever, may, result, in, feeling, cold, in, an, environment, where, people, without, fever, do, not, some, monks, are, known, to, practice, tummo, biofeedback, meditation, techniques, that, allow, them, to, raise, their, body, temperatures, substantially, the, effects, of, such, a, genetic, change, in, body, temperature, on, longevity, is, difficult, to, study, in, humans, there, are, limits, both, of, heat, and, cold, that, an, endothermic, animal, can, bear, and, other, far, wider, limits, that, an, ectothermic, animal, may, endure, and, yet, live, the, effect, of, too, extreme, a, cold, is, to, decrease, metabolism, and, hence, to, lessen, the, production, of, heat, both, catabolic, and, anabolic, pathways, share, in, this, metabolic, depression, and, though, less, energy, is, used, up, still, less, energy, is, generated, the, effects, of, this, diminished, metabolism, become, telling, on, the, central, nervous, system, first, especially, the, brain, and, those, parts, concerning, consciousness, both, heart, rate, and, respiration, rate, decrease, judgment, becomes, impaired, as, drowsiness, supervenes, becoming, steadily, deeper, until, the, individual, loses, consciousness, without, medical, intervention, death, by, hypothermia, quickly, follows, occasionally, however, convulsions, may, set, in, towards, the, end, and, death, is, caused, by, asphyxia, in, experiments, on, cats, performed, by, sutherland, simpson, and, percy, t, herring, the, animals, were, unable, to, survive, when, rectal, temperature, fell, below, 16, c, 61, f, at, this, low, temperature, respiration, became, increasingly, feeble, heart, impulse, usually, continued, after, respiration, had, ceased, the, beats, becoming, very, irregular, appearing, to, cease, then, beginning, again, death, appeared, to, be, mainly, due, to, asphyxia, and, the, only, certain, sign, that, it, had, taken, place, was, the, loss, of, knee, jerks, however, too, high, a, temperature, speeds, up, the, metabolism, of, different, tissues, to, such, a, rate, that, their, metabolic, capital, is, soon, exhausted, blood, that, is, too, warm, produces, dyspnea, by, exhausting, the, metabolic, capital, of, the, respiratory, centre, heart, rate, is, increased, the, beats, then, become, arrhythmic, and, eventually, cease, the, central, nervous, system, is, also, profoundly, affected, by, hyperthermia, and, delirium, and, convulsions, may, set, in, consciousness, may, also, be, lost, propelling, the, person, into, a, comatose, condition, these, changes, can, sometimes, also, be, observed, in, patients, experiencing, an, acute, fever, mammalian, muscle, becomes, rigid, with, heat, rigor, at, about, 50, c, with, the, sudden, rigidity, of, the, whole, body, rendering, life, impossible, h, m, vernon, performed, work, on, the, death, temperature, and, paralysis, temperature, temperature, of, heat, rigor, of, various, animals, he, found, that, species, of, the, same, class, showed, very, similar, temperature, values, those, from, the, amphibia, examined, being, 38, 5, c, fish, 39, c, reptiles, 45, c, and, various, molluscs, 46, c, also, in, the, case, of, pelagic, animals, he, showed, a, relation, between, death, temperature, and, the, quantity, of, solid, constituents, of, the, body, in, higher, animals, however, his, experiments, tend, to, show, that, there, is, greater, variation, in, both, the, chemical, and, physical, characteristics, of, the, protoplasm, and, hence, greater, variation, in, the, extreme, temperature, compatible, with, life, a, 2022, study, on, the, effect, of, heat, on, young, people, found, that, the, critical, wet, bulb, temperature, at, which, heat, stress, can, no, longer, be, compensated, t, wb, crit, in, young, healthy, adults, performing, tasks, at, modest, metabolic, rates, mimicking, basic, activities, of, daily, life, was, much, lower, than, the, 35, c, usually, assumed, at, about, 30, 55, c, in, 36, 40, c, humid, environments, but, progressively, decreased, in, hotter, dry, ambient, environments, the, maximum, temperatures, tolerated, by, certain, thermophilic, arthropods, exceeds, the, lethal, temperatures, for, most, vertebrates, the, most, heat, resistant, insects, are, three, genera, of, desert, ants, recorded, from, three, different, parts, of, the, world, the, ants, have, developed, a, lifestyle, of, scavenging, for, short, durations, during, the, hottest, hours, of, the, day, in, excess, of, 50, c, 122, f, for, the, carcasses, of, insects, and, other, forms, of, life, which, have, died, from, heat, stress, in, april, 2014, the, south, californian, mite, paratarsotomus, macropalpis, has, been, recorded, as, the, world, s, fastest, land, animal, relative, to, body, length, at, a, speed, of, 322, body, lengths, per, second, besides, the, unusually, great, speed, of, the, mites, the, researchers, were, surprised, to, find, the, mites, running, at, such, speeds, on, concrete, at, temperatures, up, to, 60, c, 140, f, which, is, significant, because, this, temperature, is, well, above, the, lethal, limit, for, the, majority, of, animal, species, in, addition, the, mites, are, able, to, stop, and, change, direction, very, quickly, spiders, like, nephila, pilipes, exhibits, active, thermal, regulation, behavior, during, high, temperature, sunny, days, it,
