pedophilia, alternatively, spelled, paedophilia, is, a, psychiatric, disorder, in, which, an, adult, or, older, adolescent, experiences, a, primary, or, exclusive, sexual, attraction, to, prepubescent, children, vii, although, girls, typically, begin, the, process, of, puberty, at, age, 10, or, 11, and, boys, at, age, 11, or, 12, psychiatric, diagnostic, criteria, for, pedophilia, extend, the, cut, off, point, for, prepubescence, to, age, 13, people, with, the, disorder, are, often, referred, to, as, pedophiles, or, paedophiles, pedophilia, is, a, paraphilia, in, recent, versions, of, formal, diagnostic, coding, systems, such, as, the, dsm, 5, and, icd, 11, pedophilia, is, distinguished, from, pedophilic, disorder, pedophilic, disorder, is, defined, as, a, pattern, of, pedophilic, arousal, accompanied, by, either, subjective, distress, or, interpersonal, difficulty, or, having, acted, on, that, arousal, the, dsm, 5, requires, that, a, person, must, be, at, least, 16, years, old, and, at, least, five, years, older, than, the, prepubescent, child, or, children, they, are, aroused, by, for, the, attraction, to, be, diagnosed, as, pedophilic, disorder, similarly, the, icd, 11, excludes, sexual, behavior, among, post, pubertal, children, who, are, close, in, age, the, dsm, requires, the, arousal, pattern, must, be, present, for, 6, months, or, longer, while, the, icd, lacks, this, requirement, the, icd, criteria, also, refrain, from, specifying, chronological, ages, in, popular, usage, the, word, pedophilia, is, often, applied, to, any, sexual, interest, in, children, or, the, act, of, child, sexual, abuse, including, any, sexual, interest, in, minors, below, the, local, age, of, consent, or, age, of, adulthood, regardless, of, their, level, of, physical, or, mental, development, vii, this, use, conflates, the, sexual, attraction, to, prepubescent, children, with, the, act, of, child, sexual, abuse, and, fails, to, distinguish, between, attraction, to, prepubescent, and, pubescent, or, post, pubescent, minors, such, use, should, be, avoided, because, although, some, people, who, commit, child, sexual, abuse, are, pedophiles, child, sexual, abuse, offenders, are, not, pedophiles, unless, they, have, a, primary, or, exclusive, sexual, interest, in, prepubescent, children, and, many, pedophiles, do, not, molest, children, pedophilia, was, first, formally, recognized, and, named, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, significant, amount, of, research, in, the, area, has, taken, place, since, the, 1980s, although, mostly, documented, in, men, there, are, also, women, who, exhibit, the, disorder, 72, 74, and, researchers, assume, available, estimates, underrepresent, the, true, number, of, female, pedophiles, no, cure, for, pedophilia, has, been, developed, but, there, are, therapies, that, can, reduce, the, incidence, of, a, person, committing, child, sexual, abuse, the, exact, causes, of, pedophilia, have, not, been, conclusively, established, 101, some, studies, of, pedophilia, in, child, sex, offenders, have, correlated, it, with, various, neurological, abnormalities, and, psychological, pathologies, the, word, pedophilia, comes, from, the, greek, pa, s, paid, s, meaning, child, and, phil, a, friendly, love, or, friendship, the, term, paedophilie, in, german, started, being, used, in, the, 1830, s, among, researchers, of, pederasty, in, ancient, greece, it, was, further, used, in, the, field, of, forensics, after, the, 1890, s, following, richard, von, krafft, ebing, s, coinage, of, the, term, paedophilia, erotica, in, the, 1896, edition, of, psychopathia, sexualis, krafft, ebing, was, the, first, researcher, to, use, the, term, pedophilia, to, refer, to, a, pattern, of, sexual, attraction, toward, children, who, had, not, yet, reached, puberty, excluding, pubescent, minors, from, the, pedophilic, age, range, in, 1895, the, english, word, pedophily, was, used, as, a, translation, of, the, german, word, p, dophilie, the, term, pedophilia, was, hardly, used, by, 1945, but, started, appearing, in, medical, records, after, 1950, by, the, 1950s, and, throughout, the, 1980s, the, word, pedophilia, started, being, increasingly, used, by, the, popular, media, infantophilia, or, nepiophilia, is, a, sub, type, of, pedophilia, it, is, used, to, refer, to, a, sexual, preference, for, children, under, the, age, of, 5, especially, infants, and, toddlers, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, nepiophilia, from, the, greek, n, pios, meaning, infant, or, child, which, in, turn, derives, from, ne, and, epos, meaning, not, speaking, though, this, term, is, rarely, used, in, academic, sources, hebephilia, is, defined, as, individuals, with, a, primary, or, exclusive, sexual, interest, in, 11, to, 14, year, old, pubescents, the, dsm, 5, does, not, list, hebephilia, among, the, diagnoses, while, evidence, suggests, that, hebephilia, is, separate, from, pedophilia, the, icd, 10, includes, early, pubertal, age, an, aspect, of, hebephilia, in, its, pedophilia, definition, covering, the, physical, development, overlap, between, the, two, philias, in, addition, to, hebephilia, some, clinicians, have, proposed, other, categories, that, are, somewhat, or, completely, distinguished, from, pedophilia, these, include, pedohebephilia, a, combination, of, pedophilia, and, hebephilia, and, ephebophilia, though, ephebophilia, is, not, considered, pathological, pedophilia, emerges, before, or, during, puberty, and, is, stable, over, time, it, is, self, discovered, not, chosen, for, these, reasons, pedophilia, has, been, described, as, a, disorder, of, sexual, preference, phenomenologically, similar, to, a, heterosexual, or, homosexual, orientation, these, observations, however, do, not, exclude, pedophilia, from, being, classified, as, a, mental, disorder, since, pedophilic, acts, cause, harm, and, mental, health, professionals, can, sometimes, help, pedophiles, to, refrain, from, harming, children, in, response, to, misinterpretations, that, the, american, psychiatric, association, considers, pedophilia, a, sexual, orientation, because, of, wording, in, its, printed, dsm, 5, manual, which, distinguishes, between, paraphilia, and, what, it, calls, paraphilic, disorder, subsequently, forming, a, division, of, pedophilia, and, pedophilic, disorder, the, association, commented, exual, orientation, is, not, a, term, used, in, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, pedophilic, disorder, and, its, use, in, the, dsm, 5, text, discussion, is, an, error, and, should, read, sexual, interest, they, added, in, fact, apa, considers, pedophilic, disorder, a, paraphilia, not, a, sexual, orientation, this, error, will, be, corrected, in, the, electronic, version, of, dsm, 5, and, the, next, printing, of, the, manual, they, said, they, strongly, support, efforts, to, criminally, prosecute, those, who, sexually, abuse, and, exploit, children, and, adolescents, and, also, support, continued, efforts, to, develop, treatments, for, those, with, pedophilic, disorder, with, the, goal, of, preventing, future, acts, of, abuse, studies, of, pedophilia, in, child, sex, offenders, often, report, that, it, co, occurs, with, other, psychopathologies, such, as, low, self, esteem, depression, anxiety, and, personality, problems, it, is, not, clear, whether, these, are, features, of, the, disorder, itself, artifacts, of, sampling, bias, or, consequences, of, being, identified, as, a, sex, offender, one, review, of, the, literature, concluded, that, research, on, personality, correlates, and, psychopathology, in, pedophiles, is, rarely, methodologically, correct, in, part, owing, to, confusion, between, pedophiles, and, child, sex, offenders, as, well, as, the, difficulty, of, obtaining, a, representative, community, sample, of, pedophiles, seto, 2004, points, out, that, pedophiles, who, are, available, from, a, clinical, setting, are, likely, there, because, of, distress, over, their, sexual, preference, or, pressure, from, others, this, increases, the, likelihood, that, they, will, show, psychological, problems, similarly, pedophiles, recruited, from, a, correctional, setting, have, been, convicted, of, a, crime, making, it, more, likely, that, they, will, show, anti, social, characteristics, impaired, self, concept, and, interpersonal, functioning, were, reported, in, a, sample, of, child, sex, offenders, who, met, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, pedophilia, by, cohen, et, al, 2002, which, the, authors, suggested, could, contribute, to, motivation, for, pedophilic, acts, the, pedophilic, offenders, in, the, study, had, elevated, psychopathy, and, cognitive, distortions, compared, to, healthy, community, controls, this, was, interpreted, as, underlying, their, failure, to, inhibit, their, criminal, behavior, studies, in, 2009, and, 2012, found, that, non, pedophilic, child, sex, offenders, exhibited, psychopathy, but, pedophiles, did, not, wilson, and, cox, 1983, studied, the, characteristics, of, a, group, of, pedophile, club, members, the, most, marked, differences, between, pedophiles, and, controls, were, on, the, introversion, scale, with, pedophiles, showing, elevated, shyness, sensitivity, and, depression, the, pedophiles, scored, higher, on, neuroticism, and, psychoticism, but, not, enough, to, be, considered, pathological, as, a, group, the, authors, caution, that, there, is, a, difficulty, in, untangling, cause, and, effect, we, cannot, tell, whether, paedophiles, gravitate, towards, children, because, being, highly, introverted, they, find, the, company, of, children, less, threatening, than, that, of, adults, or, whether, the, social, withdrawal, implied, by, their, introversion, is, a, result, of, the, isolation, engendered, by, their, preference, i, e, awareness, of, the, social, approbation, and, hostility, that, it, evokes, p, 324, in, a, non, clinical, survey, 46, of, pedophiles, reported, that, they, had, seriously, considered, suicide, for, reasons, related, to, their, sexual, interest, 32, planned, to, carry, it, out, and, 13, had, already, attempted, it, a, review, of, qualitative, research, studies, published, between, 1982, and, 2001, concluded, that, child, sexual, abusers, use, cognitive, distortions, to, meet, personal, needs, justifying, abuse, by, making, excuses, redefining, their, actions, as, love, and, mutuality, and, exploiting, the, power, imbalance, inherent, in, all, adult, child, relationships, other, cognitive, distortions, include, the, idea, of, children, as, sexual, beings, uncontrollability, of, sexual, behavior, and, sexual, entitlement, bias, consumption, of, child, pornography, is, a, more, reliable, indicator, of, pedophilia, than, molesting, a, child, although, some, non, pedophiles, also, view, child, pornography, child, pornography, may, be, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, ranging, from, private, sexual, gratification, or, trading, with, other, collectors, to, preparing, children, for, sexual, abuse, as, part, of, the, child, grooming, process, pedophilic, viewers, of, child, pornography, are, often, obsessive, about, collecting, organizing, categorizing, and, labeling, their, child, pornography, collection, according, to, age, gender, sex, act, and, fantasy, according, to, fbi, agent, ken, lanning, collecting, pornography, does, not, mean, that, they, merely, view, pornography, but, that, they, save, it, and, it, comes, to, define, fuel, and, validate, their, most, cherished, sexual, fantasies, lanning, states, that, the, collection, is, the, single, best, indicator, of, what, the, offender, wants, to, do, but, not, necessarily, of, what, has, been, or, will, be, done, researchers, taylor, and, quayle, reported, that, pedophilic, collectors, of, child, pornography, are, often, involved, in, anonymous, internet, communities, dedicated, to, extending, their, collections, although, what, causes, pedophilia, is, not, yet, known, researchers, began, reporting, a, series, of, findings, linking, pedophilia, with, brain, structure, and, function, beginning, in, 2002, testing, individuals, from, a, variety, of, referral, sources, inside, and, outside, the, criminal, justice, system, as, well, as, controls, these, studies, found, associations, between, pedophilia, and, lower, iqs, poorer, scores, on, memory, tests, greater, rates, of, non, right, handedness, greater, rates, of, school, grade, failure, over, and, above, the, iq, differences, being, below, average, height, greater, probability, of, having, had, childhood, head, injuries, resulting, in, unconsciousness, and, several, differences, in, mri, detected, brain, structures, such, studies, suggest, that, there, are, one, or, more, neurological, characteristics, present, at, birth, that, cause, or, increase, the, likelihood, of, being, pedophilic, some, studies, have, found, that, pedophiles, are, less, cognitively, impaired, than, non, pedophilic, child, molesters, a, 2011, study, reported, that, pedophilic, child, molesters, had, deficits, in, response, inhibition, but, no, deficits, in, memory, or, cognitive, flexibility, evidence, of, familial, transmittability, suggests, but, does, not, prove, that, genetic, factors, are, responsible, for, the, development, of, pedophilia, a, 2015, study, indicated, that, pedophilic, offenders, have, a, normal, iq, another, study, using, structural, mri, indicated, that, male, pedophiles, have, a, lower, volume, of, white, matter, than, a, control, group, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, has, indicated, that, child, molesters, diagnosed, with, pedophilia, have, reduced, activation, of, the, hypothalamus, as, compared, with, non, pedophilic, persons, when, viewing, sexually, arousing, pictures, of, adults, a, 2008, functional, neuroimaging, study, notes, that, central, processing, of, sexual, stimuli, in, heterosexual, paedophile, forensic, inpatients, may, be, altered, by, a, disturbance, in, the, prefrontal, networks, which, may, be, associated, with, stimulus, controlled, behaviours, such, as, sexual, compulsive, behaviours, the, findings, may, also, suggest, a, dysfunction, at, the, cognitive, stage, of, sexual, arousal, processing, blanchard, cantor, and, robichaud, 2006, reviewed, the, research, that, attempted, to, identify, hormonal, aspects, of, pedophiles, they, concluded, that, there, is, some, evidence, that, pedophilic, men, have, less, testosterone, than, controls, but, that, the, research, is, of, poor, quality, and, that, it, is, difficult, to, draw, any, firm, conclusion, from, it, while, not, causes, of, pedophilia, themselves, childhood, abuse, by, adults, or, comorbid, psychiatric, illnesses, such, as, personality, disorders, and, substance, abuse, are, risk, factors, for, acting, on, pedophilic, urges, blanchard, cantor, and, robichaud, addressed, comorbid, psychiatric, illnesses, that, the, theoretical, implications, are, not, so, clear, do, particular, genes, or, noxious, factors, in, the, prenatal, environment, predispose, a, male, to, develop, both, affective, disorders, and, pedophilia, or, do, the, frustration, danger, and, isolation, engendered, by, unacceptable, sexual, desires, or, their, occasional, furtive, satisfaction, lead, to, anxiety, and, despair, they, indicated, that, because, they, previously, found, mothers, of, pedophiles, to, be, more, likely, to, have, undergone, psychiatric, treatment, the, genetic, possibility, is, more, likely, a, study, analyzing, the, sexual, fantasies, of, 200, heterosexual, men, by, using, the, wilson, sex, fantasy, questionnaire, exam, determined, that, males, with, a, pronounced, degree, of, paraphilic, interest, including, pedophilia, had, a, greater, number, of, older, brothers, a, high, 2d, 4d, digit, ratio, which, would, indicate, low, prenatal, androgen, exposure, and, an, elevated, probability, of, being, left, handed, suggesting, that, disturbed, hemispheric, brain, lateralization, may, play, a, role, in, deviant, attractions, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, fifth, edition, text, revision, dsm, 5, tr, states, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, pedophilic, disorder, are, intended, to, apply, both, to, individuals, who, freely, disclose, this, paraphilia, and, to, individuals, who, deny, any, sexual, attraction, to, prepubertal, children, generally, age, 13, years, or, younger, despite, substantial, objective, evidence, to, the, contrary, the, manual, outlines, specific, criteria, for, use, in, the, diagnosis, of, this, disorder, these, include, the, presence, of, sexually, arousing, fantasies, behaviors, or, urges, that, involve, some, kind, of, sexual, activity, with, a, prepubescent, child, with, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, the, disorder, extending, the, cut, off, point, for, prepubescence, to, age, 13, for, six, months, or, more, or, that, the, subject, has, acted, on, these, urges, or, is, distressed, as, a, result, of, having, these, feelings, the, criteria, also, indicate, that, the, subject, should, be, 16, or, older, and, that, the, child, or, children, they, fantasize, about, are, at, least, five, years, younger, than, them, though, ongoing, sexual, relationships, between, a, 12, to, 13, year, old, and, a, late, adolescent, are, advised, to, be, excluded, a, diagnosis, is, further, specified, by, the, sex, of, the, children, the, person, is, attracted, to, if, the, impulses, or, acts, are, limited, to, incest, and, if, the, attraction, is, exclusive, or, nonexclusive, the, icd, 11, defines, pedophilic, disorder, as, a, sustained, focused, and, intense, pattern, of, sexual, arousal, as, manifested, by, persistent, sexual, thoughts, fantasies, urges, or, behaviours, involving, pre, pubertal, children, it, also, states, that, for, a, diagnosis, of, pedophilic, disorder, the, individual, must, have, acted, on, these, thoughts, fantasies, or, urges, or, be, markedly, distressed, by, them, this, diagnosis, does, not, apply, to, sexual, behaviours, among, pre, or, post, pubertal, children, with, peers, who, are, close, in, age, several, terms, have, been, used, to, distinguish, true, pedophiles, from, non, pedophilic, and, non, exclusive, offenders, or, to, distinguish, among, types, of, offenders, on, a, continuum, according, to, strength, and, exclusivity, of, pedophilic, interest, and, motivation, for, the, offense, see, child, sexual, offender, types, exclusive, pedophiles, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, true, pedophiles, they, are, sexually, attracted, to, prepubescent, children, and, only, prepubescent, children, showing, no, erotic, interest, in, adults, they, can, only, become, sexually, aroused, while, fantasizing, about, or, being, in, the, presence, of, prepubescent, children, or, both, non, exclusive, offenders, or, non, exclusive, pedophiles, may, at, times, be, referred, to, as, non, pedophilic, offenders, but, the, two, terms, are, not, always, synonymous, non, exclusive, offenders, are, sexually, attracted, to, both, children, and, adults, and, can, be, sexually, aroused, by, both, though, a, sexual, preference, for, one, over, the, other, in, this, case, may, also, exist, if, the, attraction, is, a, sexual, preference, for, prepubescent, children, such, offenders, are, considered, pedophiles, in, the, same, vein, as, exclusive, offenders, neither, the, dsm, nor, the, icd, 11, diagnostic, criteria, require, actual, sexual, activity, with, a, prepubescent, youth, the, diagnosis, can, therefore, be, made, based, on, the, presence, of, fantasies, or, sexual, urges, even, if, they, have, never, been, acted, upon, on, the, other, hand, a, person, who, acts, upon, these, urges, yet, experiences, no, distress, about, their, fantasies, or, urges, can, also, qualify, for, the, diagnosis, acting, on, sexual, urges, is, not, limited, to, overt, sex, acts, for, purposes, of, this, diagnosis, and, can, sometimes, include, indecent, exposure, voyeuristic, or, frotteuristic, behaviors, the, icd, 11, also, considers, planning, or, seeking, to, engage, in, these, behaviors, as, well, as, the, use, of, child, pornography, to, be, evidence, of, the, diagnosis, however, the, dsm, 5, tr, in, a, change, from, the, prior, edition, excludes, the, use, of, child, pornography, alone, as, meeting, the, criteria, for, acting, on, sexual, urges, this, change, is, controversial, due, to, being, made, for, legal, reasons, rather, than, scientific, according, to, forensic, psychologist, michael, c, seto, who, was, part, of, the, dsm, 5, tr, workgroup, the, removal, of, child, pornography, use, alone, was, to, avoid, diagnosing, criminal, defendants, convicted, of, child, pornography, offenses, but, no, in, person, offenses, with, pedophilic, disorder, as, this, could, potentially, lead, to, such, defendants, being, committed, to, mental, institutions, under, sexually, violent, predator, laws, seto, who, has, published, several, research, studies, on, pedophilia, and, its, relationship, with, child, pornography, objected, to, this, reasoning, by, the, apa, as, it, would, only, apply, to, a, tiny, minority, of, commitments, as, well, as, deny, help, seeking, pedophiles, access, to, clinical, care, due, to, not, having, an, official, diagnosis, for, insurance, purposes, in, practice, the, patient, s, behaviors, need, to, be, considered, in, context, with, an, element, of, clinical, judgment, before, a, diagnosis, is, made, likewise, when, the, patient, is, in, late, adolescence, the, age, difference, is, not, specified, in, hard, numbers, and, instead, requires, careful, consideration, of, the, situation, there, was, discussion, on, the, dsm, iv, tr, being, overinclusive, and, underinclusive, its, criterion, a, concerns, sexual, fantasies, or, sexual, urges, regarding, prepubescent, children, and, its, criterion, b, concerns, acting, on, those, urges, or, the, urges, causing, marked, distress, or, interpersonal, difficulty, several, researchers, discussed, whether, or, not, a, contented, pedophile, an, individual, who, fantasizes, about, having, sex, with, a, child, and, masturbates, to, these, fantasies, but, does, not, commit, child, sexual, abuse, and, who, does, not, feel, subjectively, distressed, afterward, met, the, dsm, iv, tr, criteria, for, pedophilia, since, this, person, did, not, meet, criterion, b, criticism, also, concerned, someone, who, met, criterion, b, but, did, not, meet, criterion, a, a, large, scale, survey, about, usage, of, different, classification, systems, showed, that, the, dsm, classification, is, only, rarely, used, as, an, explanation, it, was, suggested, that, the, underinclusiveness, as, well, as, a, lack, of, validity, reliability, and, clarity, might, have, led, to, the, rejection, of, the, dsm, classification, ray, blanchard, an, american, canadian, sexologist, known, for, his, research, studies, on, pedophilia, addressed, in, his, literature, review, for, the, dsm, 5, the, objections, to, the, overinclusiveness, and, under, underinclusiveness, of, the, dsm, iv, tr, and, proposed, a, general, solution, applicable, to, all, paraphilias, this, meant, namely, a, distinction, between, paraphilia, and, paraphilic, disorder, the, latter, term, is, proposed, to, identify, the, diagnosable, mental, disorder, which, meets, criterion, a, and, b, whereas, an, individual, who, does, not, meet, criterion, b, can, be, ascertained, but, not, diagnosed, as, having, a, paraphilia, blanchard, and, a, number, of, his, colleagues, also, proposed, that, hebephilia, become, a, diagnosable, mental, disorder, under, the, dsm, 5, to, resolve, the, physical, development, overlap, between, pedophilia, and, hebephilia, by, combining, the, categories, under, pedophilic, disorder, but, with, specifiers, on, which, age, range, or, both, is, the, primary, interest, the, proposal, for, hebephilia, was, rejected, by, the, american, psychiatric, association, but, the, distinction, between, paraphilia, and, paraphilic, disorder, was, implemented, the, american, psychiatric, association, stated, that, n, the, case, of, pedophilic, disorder, the, notable, detail, is, what, wasn, t, revised, in, the, new, manual, although, proposals, were, discussed, throughout, the, dsm, 5, development, process, diagnostic, criteria, ultimately, remained, the, same, as, in, dsm, iv, tr, and, that, nly, the, disorder, name, will, be, changed, from, pedophilia, to, pedophilic, disorder, to, maintain, consistency, with, the, chapter, s, other, listings, if, hebephilia, had, been, accepted, as, a, dsm, 5, diagnosable, disorder, it, would, have, been, similar, to, the, icd, 10, definition, of, pedophilia, that, already, includes, early, pubescents, and, would, have, raised, the, minimum, age, required, for, a, person, to, be, able, to, be, diagnosed, with, pedophilia, from, 16, years, to, 18, years, with, the, individual, needing, to, be, at, least, 5, years, older, than, the, minor, o, donohue, however, suggests, that, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, pedophilia, be, simplified, to, the, attraction, to, children, alone, if, ascertained, by, self, report, laboratory, findings, or, past, behavior, he, states, that, any, sexual, attraction, to, children, is, pathological, and, that, distress, is, irrelevant, noting, this, sexual, attraction, has, the, potential, to, cause, significant, harm, to, others, and, is, also, not, in, the, best, interests, of, the, individual, also, arguing, for, behavioral, criteria, in, defining, pedophilia, howard, e, barbaree, and, michael, c, seto, disagreed, with, the, american, psychiatric, association, s, approach, in, 1997, and, instead, recommended, the, use, of, actions, as, the, sole, criterion, for, the, diagnosis, of, pedophilia, as, a, means, of, taxonomic, simplification, there, is, no, evidence, that, pedophilia, can, be, cured, instead, most, therapies, focus, on, helping, pedophiles, refrain, from, acting, on, their, desires, some, therapies, do, attempt, to, cure, pedophilia, but, there, are, no, studies, showing, that, they, result, in, a, long, term, change, in, sexual, preference, michael, seto, suggests, that, attempts, to, cure, pedophilia, in, adulthood, are, unlikely, to, succeed, because, its, development, is, influenced, by, prenatal, factors, pedophilia, appears, to, be, difficult, to, alter, but, pedophiles, can, be, helped, to, control, their, behavior, and, future, research, could, develop, a, method, of, prevention, there, are, several, common, limitations, to, studies, of, treatment, effectiveness, most, categorize, their, participants, by, behavior, rather, than, erotic, age, preference, which, makes, it, difficult, to, know, the, specific, treatment, outcome, for, pedophiles, many, do, not, select, their, treatment, and, control, groups, randomly, offenders, who, refuse, or, quit, treatment, are, at, higher, risk, of, offending, so, excluding, them, from, the, treated, group, while, not, excluding, those, who, would, have, refused, or, quit, from, the, control, group, can, bias, the, treated, group, in, favor, of, those, with, lower, recidivism, the, effectiveness, of, treatment, for, non, offending, pedophiles, has, not, been, studied, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, aims, to, reduce, attitudes, beliefs, and, behaviors, that, may, increase, the, likelihood, of, sexual, offenses, against, children, its, content, varies, widely, between, therapists, but, a, typical, program, might, involve, training, in, self, control, social, competence, and, empathy, and, use, cognitive, restructuring, to, change, views, on, sex, with, children, the, most, common, form, of, this, therapy, is, relapse, prevention, where, the, patient, is, taught, to, identify, and, respond, to, potentially, risky, situations, based, on, principles, used, for, treating, addictions, 171, the, evidence, for, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, is, mixed, 171, a, 2012, cochrane, review, of, randomized, trials, found, that, cbt, had, no, effect, on, risk, of, reoffending, for, contact, sex, offenders, meta, analyses, in, 2002, and, 2005, which, included, both, randomized, and, non, randomized, studies, concluded, that, cbt, reduced, recidivism, there, is, debate, over, whether, non, randomized, studies, should, be, considered, informative, more, research, is, needed, behavioral, treatments, target, sexual, arousal, to, children, using, satiation, and, aversion, techniques, to, suppress, sexual, arousal, to, children, and, covert, sensitization, or, masturbatory, reconditioning, to, increase, sexual, arousal, to, adults, 175, behavioral, treatments, appear, to, have, an, effect, on, sexual, arousal, patterns, during, phallometric, testing, but, it, is, not, known, whether, the, effect, represents, changes, in, sexual, interests, or, changes, in, the, ability, to, control, genital, arousal, during, testing, nor, whether, the, effect, persists, in, the, long, term, for, sex, offenders, with, mental, disabilities, applied, behavior, analysis, has, been, used, pharmacological, interventions, are, used, to, lower, the, sex, drive, in, general, which, can, ease, the, management, of, pedophilic, feelings, but, does, not, change, sexual, preference, antiandrogens, work, by, interfering, with, the, activity, of, testosterone, cyproterone, acetate, androcur, and, medroxyprogesterone, acetate, depo, provera, are, the, most, commonly, used, the, efficacy, of, antiandrogens, has, some, support, but, few, high, quality, studies, exist, cyproterone, acetate, has, the, strongest, evidence, for, reducing, sexual, arousal, while, findings, on, medroxyprogesterone, acetate, have, been, mixed, 177, 181, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, analogs, such, as, leuprorelin, lupron, which, last, longer, and, have, fewer, side, effects, are, also, used, to, reduce, libido, as, are, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, 177, 181, the, evidence, for, these, alternatives, is, more, limited, and, mostly, based, on, open, trials, and, case, studies, all, of, these, treatments, commonly, referred, to, as, chemical, castration, are, often, used, in, conjunction, with, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, according, to, the, association, for, the, treatment, of, sexual, abusers, when, treating, child, molesters, anti, androgen, treatment, should, be, coupled, with, appropriate, monitoring, and, counseling, within, a, comprehensive, treatment, plan, these, drugs, may, have, side, effects, such, as, weight, gain, breast, development, liver, damage, and, osteoporosis, historically, surgical, castration, was, used, to, lower, sex, drive, by, reducing, testosterone, the, emergence, of, pharmacological, methods, of, adjusting, testosterone, has, made, it, largely, obsolete, because, they, are, similarly, effective, and, less, invasive, it, is, still, occasionally, performed, in, germany, the, czech, republic, switzerland, and, a, few, u, s, states, non, randomized, studies, have, reported, that, surgical, castration, reduces, recidivism, in, contact, sex, offenders, 181, 182, 192, the, association, for, the, treatment, of, sexual, abusers, opposes, surgical, castration, and, the, council, of, europe, works, to, bring, the, practice, to, an, end, in, eastern, european, countries, where, it, is, still, applied, through, the, courts, the, prevalence, of, pedophilia, in, the, general, population, is, not, known, but, is, estimated, to, be, lower, than, 5, among, adult, men, less, is, known, about, the, prevalence, of, pedophilia, in, women, but, there, are, case, reports, of, women, with, strong, sexual, fantasies, and, urges, towards, children, 72, 74, male, perpetrators, account, for, the, vast, majority, of, sexual, crimes, committed, against, children, among, convicted, offenders, 0, 4, to, 4, are, female, and, one, literature, review, estimates, that, the, ratio, of, male, to, female, child, molesters, is, 10, to, 1, the, true, number, of, female, child, molesters, may, be, underrepresented, by, available, estimates, for, reasons, including, a, societal, tendency, to, dismiss, the, negative, impact, of, sexual, relationships, between, young, boys, and, adult, women, as, well, as, women, s, greater, access, to, very, young, children, who, cannot, report, their, abuse, among, other, explanations, the, term, pedophile, is, commonly, used, by, the, public, to, describe, all, child, sexual, abuse, offenders, this, usage, is, considered, problematic, by, researchers, because, many, child, molesters, do, not, have, a, strong, sexual, interest, in, prepubescent, children, and, are, consequently, not, pedophiles, there, are, motives, for, child, sexual, abuse, that, are, unrelated, to, pedophilia, such, as, stress, marital, problems, the, unavailability, of, an, adult, partner, general, anti, social, tendencies, high, sex, drive, or, alcohol, use, 4, as, child, sexual, abuse, is, not, automatically, an, indicator, that, its, perpetrator, is, a, pedophile, offenders, can, be, separated, into, two, types, pedophilic, and, non, pedophilic, or, preferential, and, situational, estimates, for, the, rate, of, pedophilia, in, detected, child, molesters, generally, range, between, 25, and, 50, a, 2006, study, found, that, 35, of, its, sample, of, child, molesters, were, pedophilic, pedophilia, appears, to, be, less, common, in, incest, offenders, 123, especially, fathers, and, step, fathers, according, to, a, u, s, study, on, 2429, adult, male, sex, offenders, who, were, categorized, as, pedophiles, only, 7, identified, themselves, as, exclusive, indicating, that, many, or, most, child, sexual, abusers, may, fall, into, the, non, exclusive, category, some, pedophiles, do, not, molest, children, vii, little, is, known, about, this, population, because, most, studies, of, pedophilia, use, criminal, or, clinical, samples, which, may, not, be, representative, of, pedophiles, in, general, 47, 48, 66, researcher, michael, seto, suggests, that, pedophiles, who, commit, child, sexual, abuse, do, so, because, of, other, anti, social, traits, in, addition, to, their, sexual, attraction, he, states, that, pedophiles, who, are, reflective, sensitive, to, the, feelings, of, others, averse, to, risk, abstain, from, alcohol, or, drug, use, and, endorse, attitudes, and, beliefs, supportive, of, norms, and, the, laws, may, be, unlikely, to, abuse, children, a, 2015, study, indicates, that, pedophiles, who, molested, children, are, neurologically, distinct, from, non, offending, pedophiles, the, pedophilic, molesters, had, neurological, deficits, suggestive, of, disruptions, in, inhibitory, regions, of, the, brain, while, non, offending, pedophiles, had, no, such, deficits, according, to, abel, mittleman, and, becker, 1985, and, ward, et, al, 1995, there, are, generally, large, distinctions, between, the, characteristics, of, pedophilic, and, non, pedophilic, molesters, they, state, that, non, pedophilic, offenders, tend, to, offend, at, times, of, stress, have, a, later, onset, of, offending, and, have, fewer, often, familial, victims, while, pedophilic, offenders, often, start, offending, at, an, early, age, often, have, a, larger, number, of, victims, who, are, frequently, extrafamilial, are, more, inwardly, driven, to, offend, and, have, values, or, beliefs, that, strongly, support, an, offense, lifestyle, one, study, found, that, pedophilic, molesters, had, a, median, of, 1, 3, victims, for, those, with, girl, victims, and, 4, 4, for, those, with, boy, victims, child, molesters, pedophilic, or, not, employ, a, variety, of, methods, to, gain, sexual, access, to, children, some, groom, their, victims, into, compliance, with, attention, and, gifts, while, others, use, threats, alcohol, or, drugs, or, physical, force, 64, 189, pedophilia, is, believed, to, have, occurred, in, humans, throughout, history, the, term, paedophilie, in, german, has, been, used, since, the, late, 1830s, by, researchers, of, pederasty, in, ancient, greece, the, term, paedophilia, erotica, was, coined, in, an, 1896, article, by, the, viennese, psychiatrist, richard, von, krafft, ebing, but, does, not, enter, the, author, s, psychopathia, sexualis, until, the, 10th, german, edition, a, number, of, authors, anticipated, krafft, ebing, s, diagnostic, gesture, in, psychopathia, sexualis, the, term, appears, in, a, section, titled, violation, of, individuals, under, the, age, of, fourteen, which, focuses, on, the, forensic, psychiatry, aspect, of, child, sexual, offenders, in, general, krafft, ebing, describes, several, typologies, of, offender, dividing, them, into, psychopathological, and, non, psychopathological, origins, and, hypothesizes, several, apparent, causal, factors, that, may, lead, to, the, sexual, abuse, of, children, krafft, ebing, mentioned, paedophilia, erotica, in, a, typology, of, psycho, sexual, perversion, he, wrote, that, he, had, only, encountered, it, four, times, in, his, career, and, gave, brief, descriptions, of, each, case, listing, three, common, traits, he, mentions, several, cases, of, pedophilia, among, adult, women, provided, by, another, physician, and, also, considered, the, abuse, of, boys, by, homosexual, men, to, be, extremely, rare, further, clarifying, this, point, he, indicated, that, cases, of, adult, men, who, have, some, medical, or, neurological, disorder, and, abuse, a, male, child, are, not, true, pedophilia, and, that, in, his, observation, victims, of, such, men, tended, to, be, older, and, pubescent, he, also, lists, pseudopaedophilia, as, a, related, condition, wherein, individuals, who, have, lost, libido, for, the, adult, through, masturbation, and, subsequently, turn, to, children, for, the, gratification, of, their, sexual, appetite, and, claimed, this, is, much, more, common, austrian, neurologist, sigmund, freud, briefly, wrote, about, the, topic, in, his, 1905, book, three, essays, on, the, theory, of, sexuality, in, a, section, titled, the, sexually, immature, and, animals, as, sexual, objects, he, wrote, that, exclusive, pedophilia, was, rare, and, only, occasionally, were, prepubescent, children, exclusive, objects, he, wrote, that, they, usually, were, the, subject, of, desire, when, a, weak, person, makes, use, of, such, substitutes, or, when, an, uncontrollable, instinct, which, will, not, allow, delay, seeks, immediate, gratification, and, cannot, find, a, more, appropriate, object, in, 1908, swiss, neuroanatomist, and, psychiatrist, auguste, forel, wrote, of, the, phenomenon, proposing, that, it, be, referred, to, it, as, pederosis, the, sexual, appetite, for, children, similar, to, krafft, ebing, s, work, forel, made, the, distinction, between, incidental, sexual, abuse, by, persons, with, dementia, and, other, organic, brain, conditions, and, the, truly, preferential, and, sometimes, exclusive, sexual, desire, for, children, however, he, disagreed, with, krafft, ebing, in, that, he, felt, the, condition, of, the, latter, was, largely, ingrained, and, unchangeable, the, term, pedophilia, became, the, generally, accepted, term, for, the, condition, and, saw, widespread, adoption, in, the, early, 20th, century, appearing, in, many, popular, medical, dictionaries, such, as, the, 5th, edition, of, stedman, s, in, 1918, in, 1952, it, was, included, in, the, first, edition, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, this, edition, and, the, subsequent, dsm, ii, listed, the, disorder, as, one, subtype, of, the, classification, sexual, deviation, but, no, diagnostic, criteria, were, provided, the, dsm, iii, published, in, 1980, contained, a, full, description, of, the, disorder, and, provided, a, set, of, guidelines, for, diagnosis, the, revision, in, 1987, the, dsm, iii, r, kept, the, description, largely, the, same, but, updated, and, expanded, the, diagnostic, criteria, pedophilia, is, not, a, legal, term, as, having, a, sexual, attraction, to, children, without, acting, on, it, is, not, illegal, in, law, enforcement, circles, the, term, pedophile, is, sometimes, used, informally, to, refer, to, any, person, who, commits, one, or, more, sexually, based, crimes, that, relate, to, legally, underage, victims, these, crimes, may, include, child, sexual, abuse, statutory, rape, offenses, involving, child, pornography, child, grooming, stalking, and, indecent, exposure, one, unit, of, the, united, kingdom, s, child, abuse, investigation, command, is, known, as, the, paedophile, unit, and, specializes, in, online, investigations, and, enforcement, work, some, forensic, science, texts, such, as, holmes, 2008, use, the, term, to, refer, to, offenders, who, target, child, victims, even, when, such, children, are, not, the, primary, sexual, interest, of, the, offender, fbi, agent, kenneth, lanning, however, makes, a, point, of, distinguishing, between, pedophiles, and, child, molesters, in, the, united, states, following, kansas, v, hendricks, sex, offenders, who, have, certain, mental, disorders, including, pedophilia, can, be, subject, to, indefinite, civil, commitment, under, various, state, laws, 186, generically, called, svp, laws, and, the, federal, adam, walsh, child, protection, and, safety, act, of, 2006, similar, legislation, exists, in, canada, 186, in, kansas, v, hendricks, the, us, supreme, court, upheld, as, constitutional, a, kansas, law, the, sexually, violent, predator, act, under, which, hendricks, a, pedophile, was, found, to, have, a, mental, abnormality, defined, as, a, congenital, or, acquired, condition, affecting, the, emotional, or, volitional, capacity, which, predisposes, the, person, to, commit, sexually, violent, offenses, to, the, degree, that, such, person, is, a, menace, to, the, health, and, safety, of, others, which, allowed, the, state, to, confine, hendricks, indefinitely, irrespective, of, whether, the, state, provided, any, treatment, to, him, in, united, states, v, comstock, this, type, of, indefinite, confinement, was, upheld, for, someone, previously, convicted, on, child, pornography, charges, this, time, a, federal, law, was, involved, the, adam, walsh, child, protection, and, safety, act, the, walsh, act, does, not, require, a, conviction, on, a, sex, offense, charge, but, only, that, the, person, be, a, federal, prisoner, and, one, who, has, engaged, or, attempted, to, engage, in, sexually, violent, conduct, or, child, molestation, and, who, is, sexually, dangerous, to, others, and, who, would, have, serious, difficulty, in, refraining, from, sexually, violent, conduct, or, child, molestation, if, released, in, the, us, offenders, with, pedophilia, are, more, likely, to, be, recommended, for, civil, commitment, than, non, pedophilic, offenders, about, half, of, committed, offenders, have, a, diagnosis, of, pedophilia, 186, psychiatrist, michael, first, writes, that, since, not, all, people, with, a, paraphilia, have, difficulty, controlling, their, behavior, the, evaluating, clinician, must, present, additional, evidence, of, volitional, impairment, instead, of, recommending, commitment, based, on, pedophilia, alone, pedophilia, is, one, of, the, most, stigmatized, mental, disorders, among, the, public, common, feelings, include, anger, fear, and, social, rejection, of, pedophiles, who, have, not, committed, a, crime, such, attitudes, could, negatively, impact, child, sexual, abuse, prevention, by, reducing, pedophiles, mental, stability, and, discouraging, them, from, seeking, help, according, to, sociologists, melanie, angela, neuilly, and, kristen, zgoba, social, concern, over, pedophilia, intensified, greatly, in, the, 1990s, coinciding, with, several, sensational, sex, crimes, but, a, general, decline, in, child, sexual, abuse, rates, they, found, that, pedophile, appeared, only, rarely, in, the, new, york, times, and, le, monde, before, 1996, with, zero, mentions, in, 1991, social, attitudes, towards, child, sexual, abuse, are, extremely, negative, with, some, surveys, ranking, it, as, morally, worse, than, murder, viii, early, research, showed, that, there, was, a, great, deal, of, misunderstanding, and, unrealistic, perceptions, in, the, general, public, about, child, sexual, abuse, and, pedophiles, a, 2004, study, concluded, that, the, public, was, well, informed, on, some, aspects, of, these, subjects, the, words, pedophile, and, pedophilia, are, commonly, used, informally, to, describe, an, adult, s, sexual, interest, in, pubescent, or, post, pubescent, persons, under, the, age, of, consent, the, terms, hebephilia, or, ephebophilia, may, be, more, accurate, in, these, cases, another, common, usage, of, pedophilia, is, to, refer, to, the, act, of, sexual, abuse, itself, vii, rather, than, the, medical, meaning, which, is, a, preference, for, prepubescents, on, the, part, of, the, older, individual, see, above, for, an, explanation, of, the, distinction, there, are, also, situations, where, the, terms, are, misused, to, refer, to, relationships, where, the, younger, person, is, an, adult, of, legal, age, but, is, either, considered, too, young, in, comparison, to, their, older, partner, or, the, older, partner, occupies, a, position, of, authority, over, them, researchers, state, that, the, above, uses, of, the, term, pedophilia, are, imprecise, or, suggest, that, they, are, best, avoided, writing, in, mayo, clinic, proceedings, hall, hall, state, that, pedophilia, is, not, a, criminal, or, legal, term, from, the, late, 1950s, to, early, 1990s, several, pedophile, membership, organizations, advocated, age, of, consent, reform, to, lower, or, abolish, age, of, consent, laws, as, well, as, for, the, acceptance, of, pedophilia, as, a, sexual, orientation, rather, than, a, psychological, disorder, and, for, the, legalization, of, child, pornography, the, efforts, of, pedophile, advocacy, groups, did, not, gain, mainstream, acceptance, and, today, those, few, groups, that, have, not, dissolved, have, only, minimal, membership, and, have, ceased, their, activities, other, than, through, a, few, websites, in, contrast, to, advocacy, groups, there, are, pedophile, support, groups, and, organizations, that, do, not, support, or, condone, sexual, activities, between, adults, and, minors, members, of, these, groups, have, insight, into, their, condition, and, understand, the, potential, harm, they, could, do, and, so, seek, to, avoid, acting, on, their, impulses, anti, pedophile, activism, encompasses, opposition, against, pedophiles, against, pedophile, advocacy, groups, and, against, other, phenomena, that, are, seen, as, related, to, pedophilia, such, as, child, pornography, and, child, sexual, abuse, much, of, the, direct, action, classified, as, anti, pedophile, involves, demonstrations, against, sex, offenders, against, pedophiles, advocating, for, the, legalization, of, sexual, activity, between, adults, and, children, and, against, internet, users, who, solicit, sex, from, minors, high, profile, media, attention, to, pedophilia, has, led, to, incidents, of, moral, panic, particularly, following, reports, of, pedophilia, associated, with, satanic, ritual, abuse, and, day, care, sex, abuse, instances, of, vigilantism, have, also, been, reported, in, response, to, public, attention, on, convicted, or, suspected, child, sex, offenders, in, 2000, following, a, media, campaign, of, naming, and, shaming, suspected, pedophiles, in, the, uk, hundreds, of, residents, took, to, the, streets, in, protest, against, suspected, pedophiles, eventually, escalating, to, violent, conduct, requiring, police, intervention
