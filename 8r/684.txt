see, text, wrens, are, a, family, of, brown, passerine, birds, in, the, predominantly, new, world, family, troglodytidae, the, family, includes, 88, species, divided, into, 19, genera, only, the, eurasian, wren, occurs, in, the, old, world, where, in, anglophone, regions, it, is, commonly, known, simply, as, the, wren, as, it, is, the, originator, of, the, name, the, name, wren, has, been, applied, to, other, unrelated, birds, particularly, the, new, zealand, wrens, acanthisittidae, and, the, australian, wrens, maluridae, most, wrens, are, visually, inconspicuous, though, they, have, loud, and, often, complex, songs, exceptions, include, the, relatively, large, members, of, the, genus, campylorhynchus, which, can, be, quite, bold, in, their, behaviour, wrens, have, short, wings, that, are, barred, in, most, species, and, they, often, hold, their, tails, upright, wrens, are, primarily, insectivorous, eating, insects, spiders, and, other, small, invertebrates, but, many, species, also, eat, vegetable, matter, and, some, eat, small, frogs, and, lizards, the, english, name, wren, derives, from, middle, english, wrenne, and, old, english, wr, nna, attested, as, wernnaa, very, early, in, an, eighth, century, gloss, it, is, cognate, to, old, high, german, wrendo, wrendilo, and, icelandic, rindill, the, latter, two, including, an, additional, diminutive, ilan, suffix, the, icelandic, name, is, attested, in, old, icelandic, eddaic, as, rindil, vari, this, points, to, a, common, germanic, name, wrandjan, but, the, further, etymology, of, the, name, is, unknown, the, wren, was, also, known, as, the, kuningilin, kinglet, in, old, high, german, a, name, associated, with, the, fable, of, the, election, of, the, king, of, birds, the, bird, that, could, fly, to, the, highest, altitude, would, be, made, king, the, eagle, outflew, all, other, birds, but, he, was, beaten, by, a, small, bird, that, had, hidden, in, his, plumage, this, fable, was, already, known, to, aristotle, historia, animalium, 9, 11, and, pliny, natural, history, 10, 95, and, was, taken, up, by, medieval, authors, such, as, johann, geiler, von, kaisersberg, but, it, most, likely, originally, concerned, kinglets, regulus, such, as, the, goldcrest, and, was, apparently, motivated, by, the, yellow, crown, sported, by, these, birds, a, point, noted, already, by, ludwig, uhland, the, confusion, stemmed, in, part, from, the, similarity, and, consequent, interchangeability, of, the, ancient, greek, words, for, the, wren, basileus, king, and, the, crest, basiliskos, kinglet, and, the, legend, s, reference, to, the, smallest, of, birds, becoming, king, likely, led, the, title, to, be, transferred, to, the, equally, tiny, wren, in, modern, german, the, name, of, the, bird, is, zaunk, nig, king, of, the, fence, or, hedge, and, in, dutch, the, name, is, winterkoning, king, of, winter, the, family, name, troglodytidae, is, derived, from, troglodyte, which, means, cave, dweller, wrens, get, their, scientific, name, from, the, tendency, of, some, species, to, forage, in, dark, crevices, the, name, wren, is, also, ascribed, to, other, families, of, passerine, birds, throughout, the, world, in, europe, kinglets, are, commonly, known, as, wrens, with, the, common, firecrest, and, goldcrest, known, as, the, fire, crested, wren, and, golden, crested, wren, respectively, the, 27, australasian, wren, species, in, the, family, maluridae, are, unrelated, as, are, the, new, zealand, wrens, in, the, family, acanthisittidae, the, antbirds, in, the, family, thamnophilidae, and, the, old, world, babblers, of, the, family, timaliidae, wrens, are, medium, small, to, very, small, birds, the, eurasian, wren, is, among, the, smallest, birds, in, its, range, while, the, smaller, species, from, the, americas, are, among, the, smallest, passerines, in, that, part, of, the, world, they, range, in, size, from, the, white, bellied, wren, which, averages, under, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, and, 9, g, 0, 32, oz, to, the, giant, wren, which, averages, about, 22, cm, 8, 7, in, and, weighs, almost, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, the, dominating, colors, of, their, plumage, are, generally, drab, composed, of, gray, brown, black, and, white, and, most, species, show, some, barring, especially, on, the, tail, or, wings, no, sexual, dimorphism, is, seen, in, the, plumage, of, wrens, and, little, difference, exists, between, young, birds, and, adults, all, have, fairly, long, straight, to, marginally, decurved, downward, curving, bills, wrens, have, loud, and, often, complex, songs, sometimes, given, in, duet, by, a, pair, the, songs, of, members, of, the, genera, cyphorhinus, and, microcerculus, have, been, considered, especially, pleasant, to, the, human, ear, leading, to, common, names, such, as, song, wren, musician, wren, flutist, wren, and, southern, nightingale, wren, wrens, are, principally, a, new, world, family, distributed, from, alaska, and, canada, to, southern, argentina, with, the, greatest, species, richness, in, the, neotropics, as, suggested, by, its, name, the, eurasian, wren, is, the, only, species, of, wren, found, outside, the, americas, as, restricted, to, europe, asia, and, northern, africa, it, was, formerly, considered, conspecific, with, the, winter, wren, and, pacific, wren, of, north, america, the, insular, species, include, the, clari, n, wren, and, socorro, wren, from, the, revillagigedo, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, and, cobb, s, wren, in, the, falkland, islands, but, few, caribbean, islands, have, a, species, of, wren, with, only, the, southern, house, wren, in, the, lesser, antilles, the, cozumel, wren, of, cozumel, island, and, the, highly, restricted, zapata, wren, in, a, single, swamp, in, cuba, the, various, species, occur, in, a, wide, range, of, habitats, ranging, from, dry, sparsely, wooded, country, to, rainforests, most, species, are, mainly, found, at, low, levels, but, members, of, the, genus, campylorhynchus, are, frequently, found, higher, and, the, two, members, of, odontorchilus, are, restricted, to, the, forest, canopy, a, few, species, notably, the, eurasian, wren, and, the, house, wren, are, often, associated, with, humans, most, species, are, resident, remaining, in, central, and, south, america, all, year, round, but, the, few, species, found, in, temperate, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, are, partially, migratory, spending, the, winter, further, south, wrens, vary, from, highly, secretive, species, such, as, those, found, in, the, genus, microcerculus, to, the, highly, conspicuous, genus, campylorhynchus, the, members, of, which, frequently, sing, from, exposed, perches, the, family, as, a, whole, exhibits, a, great, deal, of, variation, in, their, behavior, temperate, species, generally, occur, in, pairs, but, some, tropical, species, may, occur, in, parties, of, up, to, 20, birds, wrens, build, dome, shaped, nests, and, may, be, either, monogamous, or, polygamous, depending, on, species, though, little, is, known, about, the, feeding, habits, of, many, of, the, neotropical, species, wrens, are, considered, primarily, insectivorous, eating, insects, spiders, and, other, small, arthropods, many, species, also, take, vegetable, matter, such, as, seeds, and, berries, and, some, primarily, the, larger, species, take, small, frogs, and, lizards, the, eurasian, wren, has, been, recorded, wading, into, shallow, water, to, catch, small, fish, and, tadpoles, sumichrast, s, wren, and, the, zapata, wren, take, snails, and, the, giant, wren, and, marsh, wren, have, been, recorded, attacking, and, eating, bird, eggs, in, the, latter, species, even, eggs, of, conspecifics, a, local, spanish, name, for, the, giant, wren, and, bicolored, wren, is, chupahuevo, egg, sucker, but, whether, the, latter, actually, eats, eggs, is, unclear, the, plain, wren, and, northern, house, wren, sometimes, destroy, bird, eggs, and, the, rufous, and, white, wren, has, been, recorded, killing, nestlings, but, this, is, apparently, to, eliminate, potential, food, competitors, rather, than, to, feed, on, the, eggs, or, nestlings, several, species, of, neotropical, wrens, sometimes, participate, in, mixed, species, flocks, or, follow, army, ants, and, the, eurasian, wren, may, follow, badgers, to, catch, prey, items, disturbed, by, them, tichodromidae, wallcreeper, sittidae, nuthatches, certhiidae, treecreepers, polioptilidae, gnatcatchers, troglodytidae, wrens, revised, following, mart, nez, g, mez, et, al, 2005, and, mann, et, al, 2006, the, taxonomy, of, some, groups, is, highly, complex, and, future, species, level, splits, are, likely, additionally, undescribed, taxa, are, known, to, exist, the, black, capped, donacobius, is, an, enigmatic, species, traditionally, placed, with, the, wrens, more, for, lack, of, a, more, apparent, alternative, than, as, a, result, of, thorough, study, it, was, recently, determined, to, be, most, likely, closer, to, certain, warblers, possibly, the, newly, established, megaluridae, and, might, constitute, a, monotypic, family, family, troglodytidae, the, wren, features, prominently, in, culture, the, eurasian, wren, has, been, long, considered, the, king, of, birds, in, europe, killing, one, or, harassing, its, nest, is, associated, with, bad, luck, such, as, broken, bones, lightning, strikes, on, homes, or, injury, to, cattle, wren, day, celebrated, in, parts, of, ireland, on, st, stephen, s, day, 26, december, features, a, fake, wren, being, paraded, around, town, on, a, decorative, pole, up, to, the, 20th, century, real, birds, were, hunted, for, this, purpose, a, possible, origin, for, the, tradition, is, revenge, for, the, betrayal, of, saint, stephen, by, a, noisy, wren, when, he, was, trying, to, hide, from, enemies, in, a, bush, the, carolina, wren, thryothorus, ludovicianus, has, been, the, state, bird, of, south, carolina,
