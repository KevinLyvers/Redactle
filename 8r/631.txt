the, passenger, pigeon, or, wild, pigeon, ectopistes, migratorius, is, an, extinct, species, of, pigeon, that, was, endemic, to, north, america, its, common, name, is, derived, from, the, french, word, passager, meaning, passing, by, due, to, the, migratory, habits, of, the, species, the, scientific, name, also, refers, to, its, migratory, characteristics, the, morphologically, similar, mourning, dove, zenaida, macroura, was, long, thought, to, be, its, closest, relative, and, the, two, were, at, times, confused, but, genetic, analysis, has, shown, that, the, genus, patagioenas, is, more, closely, related, to, it, than, the, zenaida, doves, the, passenger, pigeon, was, sexually, dimorphic, in, size, and, coloration, the, male, was, 390, to, 410, mm, 15, 4, to, 16, 1, in, in, length, mainly, gray, on, the, upperparts, lighter, on, the, underparts, with, iridescent, bronze, feathers, on, the, neck, and, black, spots, on, the, wings, the, female, was, 380, to, 400, mm, 15, 0, to, 15, 7, in, and, was, duller, and, browner, than, the, male, overall, the, juvenile, was, similar, to, the, female, but, without, iridescence, it, mainly, inhabited, the, deciduous, forests, of, eastern, north, america, and, was, also, recorded, elsewhere, but, bred, primarily, around, the, great, lakes, the, pigeon, migrated, in, enormous, flocks, constantly, searching, for, food, shelter, and, breeding, grounds, and, was, once, the, most, abundant, bird, in, north, america, numbering, around, 3, billion, and, possibly, up, to, 5, billion, a, very, fast, flyer, the, passenger, pigeon, could, reach, a, speed, of, 100, km, h, 62, mph, the, bird, fed, mainly, on, mast, and, also, fruits, and, invertebrates, it, practiced, communal, roosting, and, communal, breeding, and, its, extreme, gregariousness, may, have, been, linked, with, searching, for, food, and, predator, satiation, passenger, pigeons, were, hunted, by, native, americans, but, hunting, intensified, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, particularly, in, the, 19th, century, pigeon, meat, was, commercialized, as, cheap, food, resulting, in, hunting, on, a, massive, scale, for, many, decades, there, were, several, other, factors, contributing, to, the, decline, and, subsequent, extinction, of, the, species, including, shrinking, of, the, large, breeding, populations, necessary, for, preservation, of, the, species, and, widespread, deforestation, which, destroyed, its, habitat, a, slow, decline, between, about, 1800, and, 1870, was, followed, by, a, rapid, decline, between, 1870, and, 1890, in, 1900, the, last, confirmed, wild, bird, was, shot, in, southern, ohio, the, last, captive, birds, were, divided, in, three, groups, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, some, of, which, were, photographed, alive, martha, thought, to, be, the, last, passenger, pigeon, died, on, september, 1, 1914, at, the, cincinnati, zoo, the, eradication, of, the, species, is, a, notable, example, of, anthropogenic, extinction, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, coined, the, binomial, name, columba, macroura, for, both, the, mourning, dove, and, the, passenger, pigeon, in, the, 1758, edition, of, his, work, systema, naturae, the, starting, point, of, biological, nomenclature, wherein, he, appears, to, have, considered, the, two, identical, this, composite, description, cited, accounts, of, these, birds, in, two, pre, linnean, books, one, of, these, was, mark, catesby, s, description, of, the, passenger, pigeon, which, was, published, in, his, 1731, to, 1743, work, natural, history, of, carolina, florida, and, the, bahama, islands, which, referred, to, this, bird, as, palumbus, migratorius, and, was, accompanied, by, the, earliest, published, illustration, of, the, species, catesby, s, description, was, combined, with, the, 1743, description, of, the, mourning, dove, by, george, edwards, who, used, the, name, c, macroura, for, that, bird, there, is, nothing, to, suggest, linnaeus, ever, saw, specimens, of, these, birds, himself, and, his, description, is, thought, to, be, fully, derivative, of, these, earlier, accounts, and, their, illustrations, in, his, 1766, edition, of, systema, naturae, linnaeus, dropped, the, name, c, macroura, and, instead, used, the, name, c, migratoria, for, the, passenger, pigeon, and, c, carolinensis, for, the, mourning, dove, in, the, same, edition, linnaeus, also, named, c, canadensis, based, on, turtur, canadensis, as, used, by, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1760, brisson, s, description, was, later, shown, to, have, been, based, on, a, female, passenger, pigeon, in, 1827, william, john, swainson, moved, the, passenger, pigeon, from, the, genus, columba, to, the, new, monotypic, genus, ectopistes, due, in, part, to, the, length, of, the, wings, and, the, wedge, shape, of, the, tail, in, 1906, outram, bangs, suggested, that, because, linnaeus, had, wholly, copied, catesby, s, text, when, coining, c, macroura, this, name, should, apply, to, the, passenger, pigeon, as, e, macroura, in, 1918, harry, c, oberholser, suggested, that, c, canadensis, should, take, precedence, over, c, migratoria, as, e, canadensis, as, it, appeared, on, an, earlier, page, in, linnaeus, book, in, 1952, francis, hemming, proposed, that, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, iczn, secure, the, specific, name, macroura, for, the, mourning, dove, and, the, name, migratorius, for, the, passenger, pigeon, since, this, was, the, intended, use, by, the, authors, on, whose, work, linnaeus, had, based, his, description, this, was, accepted, by, the, iczn, which, used, its, plenary, powers, to, designate, the, species, for, the, respective, names, in, 1955, the, passenger, pigeon, was, a, member, of, the, pigeon, and, dove, family, columbidae, the, oldest, known, fossil, of, the, genus, is, an, isolated, humerus, usnm, 430960, known, from, the, lee, creek, mine, in, north, carolina, in, sediments, belonging, to, the, yorktown, formation, dating, to, the, zanclean, stage, of, the, pliocene, between, 5, 3, and, 3, 6, million, years, ago, its, closest, living, relatives, were, long, thought, to, be, the, zenaida, doves, based, on, morphological, grounds, particularly, the, physically, similar, mourning, dove, now, z, macroura, it, was, even, suggested, that, the, mourning, dove, belonged, to, the, genus, ectopistes, and, was, listed, as, e, carolinensis, by, some, authors, including, thomas, mayo, brewer, the, passenger, pigeon, was, supposedly, descended, from, zenaida, pigeons, that, had, adapted, to, the, woodlands, on, the, plains, of, central, north, america, the, passenger, pigeon, differed, from, the, species, in, the, genus, zenaida, in, being, larger, lacking, a, facial, stripe, being, sexually, dimorphic, and, having, iridescent, neck, feathers, and, a, smaller, clutch, in, a, 2002, study, by, american, geneticist, beth, shapiro, et, al, museum, specimens, of, the, passenger, pigeon, were, included, in, an, ancient, dna, analysis, for, the, first, time, in, a, paper, focusing, mainly, on, the, dodo, and, it, was, found, to, be, the, sister, taxon, of, the, cuckoo, dove, genus, macropygia, the, zenaida, doves, were, instead, shown, to, be, related, to, the, quail, doves, of, the, genus, geotrygon, and, the, leptotila, doves, a, more, extensive, 2010, study, instead, showed, that, the, passenger, pigeon, was, most, closely, related, to, the, new, world, patagioenas, pigeons, including, the, band, tailed, pigeon, p, fasciata, of, western, north, america, which, are, related, to, the, southeast, asian, species, in, the, genera, turacoena, macropygia, and, reinwardtoena, this, clade, is, also, related, to, the, columba, and, streptopelia, doves, of, the, old, world, collectively, termed, the, typical, pigeons, and, doves, the, authors, of, the, study, suggested, that, the, ancestors, of, the, passenger, pigeon, may, have, colonized, the, new, world, from, south, east, asia, by, flying, across, the, pacific, ocean, or, perhaps, across, beringia, in, the, north, in, a, 2012, study, the, nuclear, dna, of, the, passenger, pigeon, was, analyzed, for, the, first, time, and, its, relationship, with, the, patagioenas, pigeon, was, confirmed, in, contrast, to, the, 2010, study, these, authors, suggested, that, their, results, could, indicate, that, the, ancestors, of, the, passenger, pigeon, and, its, old, world, relatives, may, have, originated, in, the, neotropical, region, of, the, new, world, the, cladogram, below, follows, the, 2012, dna, study, showing, the, position, of, the, passenger, pigeon, among, its, closest, relatives, macropygia, cuckoo, doves, reinwardtoena, turacoena, columba, old, world, pigeons, streptopelia, turtle, doves, and, collared, doves, patagioenas, new, world, pigeons, ectopistes, passenger, pigeon, dna, in, old, museum, specimens, is, often, degraded, and, fragmentary, and, passenger, pigeon, specimens, have, been, used, in, various, studies, to, discover, improved, methods, of, analyzing, and, assembling, genomes, from, such, material, dna, samples, are, often, taken, from, the, toe, pads, of, bird, skins, in, museums, as, this, can, be, done, without, causing, significant, damage, to, valuable, specimens, the, passenger, pigeon, had, no, known, subspecies, hybridization, occurred, between, the, passenger, pigeon, and, the, barbary, dove, streptopelia, risoria, in, the, aviary, of, charles, otis, whitman, who, owned, many, of, the, last, captive, birds, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, kept, them, with, other, pigeon, species, but, the, offspring, were, infertile, the, genus, name, ectopistes, translates, as, moving, about, or, wandering, while, the, specific, name, migratorius, indicates, its, migratory, habits, the, full, binomial, can, thus, be, translated, as, migratory, wanderer, the, english, common, name, passenger, pigeon, derives, from, the, french, word, passager, which, means, to, pass, by, in, a, fleeting, manner, while, the, pigeon, was, extant, the, name, passenger, pigeon, was, used, interchangeably, with, wild, pigeon, the, bird, also, gained, some, less, frequently, used, names, including, blue, pigeon, merne, rouck, pigeon, wandering, long, tailed, dove, and, wood, pigeon, in, the, 18th, century, the, passenger, pigeon, was, known, as, tourte, in, new, france, in, modern, canada, but, to, the, french, in, europe, it, was, known, as, tourtre, in, modern, french, the, bird, is, known, as, tourte, voyageuse, or, pigeon, migrateur, among, other, names, in, the, native, american, algonquian, languages, the, pigeon, was, called, amimi, by, the, lenape, omiimii, by, the, ojibwe, and, mimia, by, the, kaskaskia, illinois, other, names, in, indigenous, american, languages, include, ori, te, in, mohawk, and, putchee, nashoba, or, lost, dove, in, choctaw, the, seneca, people, called, the, pigeon, jahgowa, meaning, big, bread, as, it, was, a, source, of, food, for, their, tribes, chief, simon, pokagon, of, the, potawatomi, stated, that, his, people, called, the, pigeon, o, me, me, wog, and, that, the, europeans, did, not, adopt, native, names, for, the, bird, as, it, reminded, them, of, their, domesticated, pigeons, instead, calling, them, wild, pigeons, as, they, called, the, native, peoples, wild, men, the, passenger, pigeon, was, sexually, dimorphic, in, size, and, coloration, it, weighed, between, 260, and, 340, g, 9, 2, and, 12, 0, oz, the, adult, male, was, about, 390, to, 410, mm, 15, 4, to, 16, 1, in, in, length, it, had, a, bluish, gray, head, nape, and, hindneck, on, the, sides, of, the, neck, and, the, upper, mantle, were, iridescent, display, feathers, that, have, variously, been, described, as, being, a, bright, bronze, violet, or, golden, green, depending, on, the, angle, of, the, light, the, upper, back, and, wings, were, a, pale, or, slate, gray, tinged, with, olive, brown, that, turned, into, grayish, brown, on, the, lower, wings, the, lower, back, and, rump, were, a, dark, blue, gray, that, became, grayish, brown, on, the, upper, tail, covert, feathers, the, greater, and, median, wing, covert, feathers, were, pale, gray, with, a, small, number, of, irregular, black, spots, near, the, end, the, primary, and, secondary, feathers, of, the, wing, were, a, blackish, brown, with, a, narrow, white, edge, on, the, outer, side, of, the, secondaries, the, two, central, tail, feathers, were, brownish, gray, and, the, rest, were, white, the, tail, pattern, was, distinctive, as, it, had, white, outer, edges, with, blackish, spots, that, were, prominently, displayed, in, flight, the, lower, throat, and, breast, were, richly, pinkish, rufous, grading, into, a, paler, pink, further, down, and, into, white, on, the, abdomen, and, undertail, covert, feathers, the, undertail, coverts, also, had, a, few, black, spots, the, bill, was, black, while, the, feet, and, legs, were, a, bright, coral, red, it, had, a, carmine, red, iris, surrounded, by, a, narrow, purplish, red, eye, ring, the, wing, of, the, male, measured, 196, to, 215, mm, 7, 7, to, 8, 5, in, the, tail, 175, to, 210, mm, 6, 9, to, 8, 3, in, the, bill, 15, to, 18, mm, 0, 59, to, 0, 71, in, and, the, tarsus, was, 26, to, 28, mm, 1, 0, to, 1, 1, in, the, adult, female, passenger, pigeon, was, slightly, smaller, than, the, male, at, 380, to, 400, mm, 15, 0, to, 15, 7, in, in, length, it, was, duller, than, the, male, overall, and, was, a, grayish, brown, on, the, forehead, crown, and, nape, down, to, the, scapulars, and, the, feathers, on, the, sides, of, the, neck, had, less, iridescence, than, those, of, the, male, the, lower, throat, and, breast, were, a, buff, gray, that, developed, into, white, on, the, belly, and, undertail, coverts, it, was, browner, on, the, upperparts, and, paler, buff, brown, and, less, rufous, on, the, underparts, than, the, male, the, wings, back, and, tail, were, similar, in, appearance, to, those, of, the, male, except, that, the, outer, edges, of, the, primary, feathers, were, edged, in, buff, or, rufous, buff, the, wings, had, more, spotting, than, those, of, the, male, the, tail, was, shorter, than, that, of, the, male, and, the, legs, and, feet, were, a, paler, red, the, iris, was, orange, red, with, a, grayish, blue, naked, orbital, ring, the, wing, of, the, female, was, 180, to, 210, mm, 7, 1, to, 8, 3, in, the, tail, 150, to, 200, mm, 5, 9, to, 7, 9, in, the, bill, 15, to, 18, mm, 0, 59, to, 0, 71, in, and, the, tarsus, was, 25, to, 28, mm, 0, 98, to, 1, 10, in, the, juvenile, passenger, pigeon, was, similar, in, plumage, to, the, adult, female, but, lacked, the, spotting, on, the, wings, and, was, a, darker, brownish, gray, on, the, head, neck, and, breast, the, feathers, on, the, wings, had, pale, gray, fringes, also, described, as, white, tips, giving, it, a, scaled, look, the, secondaries, were, brownish, black, with, pale, edges, and, the, tertial, feathers, had, a, rufous, wash, the, primaries, were, also, edged, with, a, rufous, brown, color, the, neck, feathers, had, no, iridescence, the, legs, and, feet, were, dull, red, and, the, iris, was, brownish, and, surrounded, by, a, narrow, carmine, ring, the, plumage, of, the, sexes, was, similar, during, their, first, year, of, the, hundreds, of, surviving, skins, only, one, appears, to, be, aberrant, in, color, an, adult, female, from, the, collection, of, walter, rothschild, natural, history, museum, at, tring, it, is, a, washed, brown, on, the, upper, parts, wing, covert, secondary, feathers, and, tail, where, it, would, otherwise, have, been, gray, and, white, on, the, primary, feathers, and, underparts, the, normally, black, spots, are, brown, and, it, is, pale, gray, on, the, head, lower, back, and, upper, tail, covert, feathers, yet, the, iridescence, is, unaffected, the, brown, mutation, is, a, result, of, a, reduction, in, eumelanin, due, to, incomplete, synthesis, oxidation, of, this, pigment, this, sex, linked, mutation, is, common, in, female, wild, birds, but, it, is, thought, the, white, feathers, of, this, specimen, are, instead, the, result, of, bleaching, due, to, exposure, to, sunlight, the, passenger, pigeon, was, physically, adapted, for, speed, endurance, and, maneuverability, in, flight, and, has, been, described, as, having, a, streamlined, version, of, the, typical, pigeon, shape, such, as, that, of, the, generalized, rock, dove, columba, livia, the, wings, were, very, long, and, pointed, and, measured, 220, mm, 8, 7, in, from, the, wing, chord, to, the, primary, feathers, and, 120, mm, 4, 7, in, to, the, secondaries, the, tail, which, accounted, for, much, of, its, overall, length, was, long, and, wedge, shaped, or, graduated, with, two, central, feathers, longer, than, the, rest, the, body, was, slender, and, narrow, and, the, head, and, neck, were, small, the, internal, anatomy, of, the, passenger, pigeon, has, rarely, been, described, robert, w, shufeldt, found, little, to, differentiate, the, bird, s, osteology, from, that, of, other, pigeons, when, examining, a, male, skeleton, in, 1914, but, julian, p, hume, noted, several, distinct, features, in, a, more, detailed, 2015, description, the, pigeon, s, particularly, large, breast, muscles, indicated, a, powerful, flight, musculus, pectoralis, major, for, downstroke, and, the, smaller, musculus, supracoracoideus, for, upstroke, the, coracoid, bone, which, connects, the, scapula, furcula, and, sternum, was, large, relative, to, the, size, of, the, bird, 33, 4, mm, 1, 31, in, with, straighter, shafts, and, more, robust, articular, ends, than, in, other, pigeons, the, furcula, had, a, sharper, v, shape, and, was, more, robust, with, expanded, articular, ends, the, scapula, was, long, straight, and, robust, and, its, distal, end, was, enlarged, the, sternum, was, very, large, and, robust, compared, to, that, of, other, pigeons, its, keel, was, 25, mm, 0, 98, in, deep, the, overlapping, uncinate, processes, which, stiffen, the, ribcage, were, very, well, developed, the, wing, bones, humerus, radius, ulna, carpometacarpus, were, short, but, robust, compared, to, other, pigeons, the, leg, bones, were, similar, to, those, of, other, pigeons, the, noise, produced, by, flocks, of, passenger, pigeons, was, described, as, deafening, audible, for, miles, away, and, the, bird, s, voice, as, loud, harsh, and, unmusical, it, was, also, described, by, some, as, clucks, twittering, and, cooing, and, as, a, series, of, low, notes, instead, of, an, actual, song, the, birds, apparently, made, croaking, noises, when, building, nests, and, bell, like, sounds, when, mating, during, feeding, some, individuals, would, give, alarm, calls, when, facing, a, threat, and, the, rest, of, the, flock, would, join, the, sound, while, taking, off, in, 1911, american, behavioral, scientist, wallace, craig, published, an, account, of, the, gestures, and, sounds, of, this, species, as, a, series, of, descriptions, and, musical, notations, based, on, observation, of, c, o, whitman, s, captive, passenger, pigeons, in, 1903, craig, compiled, these, records, to, assist, in, identifying, potential, survivors, in, the, wild, as, the, physically, similar, mourning, doves, could, otherwise, be, mistaken, for, passenger, pigeons, while, noting, this, meager, information, was, likely, all, that, would, be, left, on, the, subject, according, to, craig, one, call, was, a, simple, harsh, keck, that, could, be, given, twice, in, succession, with, a, pause, in, between, this, was, said, to, be, used, to, attract, the, attention, of, another, pigeon, another, call, was, a, more, frequent, and, variable, scolding, this, sound, was, described, as, kee, kee, kee, kee, or, tete, tete, tete, and, was, used, to, call, either, to, its, mate, or, towards, other, creatures, it, considered, to, be, enemies, one, variant, of, this, call, described, as, a, long, drawn, out, tweet, could, be, used, to, call, down, a, flock, of, passenger, pigeons, passing, overhead, which, would, then, land, in, a, nearby, tree, keeho, was, a, soft, cooing, that, while, followed, by, louder, keck, notes, or, scolding, was, directed, at, the, bird, s, mate, a, nesting, passenger, pigeon, would, also, give, off, a, stream, of, at, least, eight, mixed, notes, that, were, both, high, and, low, in, tone, and, ended, with, keeho, overall, female, passenger, pigeons, were, quieter, and, called, infrequently, craig, suggested, that, the, loud, strident, voice, and, degenerated, musicality, was, the, result, of, living, in, populous, colonies, where, only, the, loudest, sounds, could, be, heard, the, passenger, pigeon, was, found, across, most, of, north, america, east, of, the, rocky, mountains, from, the, great, plains, to, the, atlantic, coast, in, the, east, to, the, south, of, canada, in, the, north, and, the, north, of, mississippi, in, the, southern, united, states, coinciding, with, its, primary, habitat, the, eastern, deciduous, forests, within, this, range, it, constantly, migrated, in, search, of, food, and, shelter, it, is, unclear, if, the, birds, favored, particular, trees, and, terrain, but, they, were, possibly, not, restricted, to, one, type, as, long, as, their, numbers, could, be, supported, it, originally, bred, from, the, southern, parts, of, eastern, and, central, canada, south, to, eastern, kansas, oklahoma, mississippi, and, georgia, in, the, united, states, but, the, primary, breeding, range, was, in, southern, ontario, and, the, great, lakes, states, south, through, states, north, of, the, appalachian, mountains, though, the, western, forests, were, ecologically, similar, to, those, in, the, east, these, were, occupied, by, band, tailed, pigeons, which, may, have, kept, out, the, passenger, pigeons, through, competitive, exclusion, the, passenger, pigeon, wintered, from, arkansas, tennessee, and, north, carolina, south, to, texas, the, gulf, coast, and, northern, florida, though, flocks, occasionally, wintered, as, far, north, as, southern, pennsylvania, and, connecticut, it, preferred, to, winter, in, large, swamps, particularly, those, with, alder, trees, if, swamps, were, not, available, forested, areas, particularly, with, pine, trees, were, favored, roosting, sites, there, were, also, sightings, of, passenger, pigeons, outside, of, its, normal, range, including, in, several, western, states, bermuda, cuba, and, mexico, particularly, during, severe, winters, it, has, been, suggested, that, some, of, these, extralimital, records, may, have, been, due, to, the, paucity, of, observers, rather, than, the, actual, extent, of, passenger, pigeons, north, america, was, then, unsettled, country, and, the, bird, may, have, appeared, anywhere, on, the, continent, except, for, the, far, west, there, were, also, records, of, stragglers, in, scotland, ireland, and, france, although, these, birds, may, have, been, escaped, captives, or, the, records, incorrect, more, than, 130, passenger, pigeon, fossils, have, been, found, scattered, across, 25, us, states, including, in, the, la, brea, tar, pits, of, california, these, records, date, as, far, back, as, 100, 000, years, ago, in, the, pleistocene, era, during, which, the, pigeon, s, range, extended, to, several, western, states, that, were, not, a, part, of, its, modern, range, the, abundance, of, the, species, in, these, regions, and, during, this, time, is, unknown, the, passenger, pigeon, was, nomadic, constantly, migrating, in, search, of, food, shelter, or, nesting, grounds, in, his, 1831, ornithological, biography, american, naturalist, and, artist, john, james, audubon, described, a, migration, he, observed, in, 1813, as, follows, i, dismounted, seated, myself, on, an, eminence, and, began, to, mark, with, my, pencil, making, a, dot, for, every, flock, that, passed, in, a, short, time, finding, the, task, which, i, had, undertaken, impracticable, as, the, birds, poured, in, in, countless, multitudes, i, rose, and, counting, the, dots, then, put, down, found, that, 163, had, been, made, in, twenty, one, minutes, i, traveled, on, and, still, met, more, the, farther, i, proceeded, the, air, was, literally, filled, with, pigeons, the, light, of, noon, day, was, obscured, as, by, an, eclipse, the, dung, fell, in, spots, not, unlike, melting, flakes, of, snow, and, the, continued, buzz, of, wings, had, a, tendency, to, lull, my, senses, to, repose, i, cannot, describe, to, you, the, extreme, beauty, of, their, aerial, evolutions, when, a, hawk, chanced, to, press, upon, the, rear, of, the, flock, at, once, like, a, torrent, and, with, a, noise, like, thunder, they, rushed, into, a, compact, mass, pressing, upon, each, other, towards, the, center, in, these, almost, solid, masses, they, darted, forward, in, undulating, and, angular, lines, descended, and, swept, close, over, the, earth, with, inconceivable, velocity, mounted, perpendicularly, so, as, to, resemble, a, vast, column, and, when, high, were, seen, wheeling, and, twisting, within, their, continued, lines, which, then, resembled, the, coils, of, a, gigantic, serpent, before, sunset, i, reached, louisville, distant, from, hardensburgh, fifty, five, miles, the, pigeons, were, still, passing, in, undiminished, numbers, and, continued, to, do, so, for, three, days, in, succession, these, flocks, were, frequently, described, as, being, so, dense, that, they, blackened, the, sky, and, as, having, no, sign, of, subdivisions, the, flocks, ranged, from, only, 1, 0, m, 3, 3, ft, above, the, ground, in, windy, conditions, to, as, high, as, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, these, migrating, flocks, were, typically, in, narrow, columns, that, twisted, and, undulated, and, they, were, reported, as, being, in, nearly, every, conceivable, shape, a, skilled, flyer, the, passenger, pigeon, is, estimated, to, have, averaged, 100, km, h, 62, mph, during, migration, it, flew, with, quick, repeated, flaps, that, increased, the, bird, s, velocity, the, closer, the, wings, got, to, the, body, it, was, equally, adept, and, quick, flying, through, a, forest, as, through, open, space, a, flock, was, also, adept, at, following, the, lead, of, the, pigeon, in, front, of, it, and, flocks, swerved, together, to, avoid, a, predator, when, landing, the, pigeon, flapped, its, wings, repeatedly, before, raising, them, at, the, moment, of, landing, the, pigeon, was, awkward, when, on, the, ground, and, moved, around, with, jerky, alert, steps, the, passenger, pigeon, was, one, of, the, most, social, of, all, land, birds, estimated, to, have, numbered, three, to, five, billion, at, the, height, of, its, population, it, may, have, been, the, most, numerous, bird, on, earth, researcher, arlie, w, schorger, believed, that, it, accounted, for, between, 25, and, 40, percent, of, the, total, land, bird, population, in, the, united, states, the, passenger, pigeon, s, historic, population, is, roughly, the, equivalent, of, the, number, of, birds, that, overwinter, in, the, united, states, every, year, in, the, early, 21st, century, even, within, their, range, the, size, of, individual, flocks, could, vary, greatly, in, november, 1859, henry, david, thoreau, writing, in, concord, massachusetts, noted, that, quite, a, little, flock, of, pigeons, bred, here, last, summer, while, only, seven, years, later, in, 1866, one, flock, in, southern, ontario, was, described, as, being, 1, 5, km, 0, 93, mi, wide, and, 500, km, 310, mi, long, took, 14, hours, to, pass, and, held, in, excess, of, 3, 5, billion, birds, such, a, number, would, likely, represent, a, large, fraction, of, the, entire, population, at, the, time, or, perhaps, all, of, it, most, estimations, of, numbers, were, based, on, single, migrating, colonies, and, it, is, unknown, how, many, of, these, existed, at, a, given, time, american, writer, christopher, cokinos, has, suggested, that, if, the, birds, flew, single, file, they, would, have, stretched, around, the, earth, 22, times, a, 2014, genetic, study, based, on, coalescent, theory, and, on, sequences, from, most, of, the, genome, of, three, individual, passenger, pigeons, suggested, that, the, passenger, pigeon, population, experienced, dramatic, fluctuations, across, the, last, million, years, due, to, their, dependence, on, availability, of, mast, which, itself, fluctuates, the, study, suggested, the, bird, was, not, always, abundant, mainly, persisting, at, around, 1, 10, 000, the, amount, of, the, several, billions, estimated, in, the, 1800s, with, vastly, larger, numbers, present, during, outbreak, phases, some, early, accounts, also, suggest, that, the, appearance, of, flocks, in, great, numbers, was, an, irregular, occurrence, these, large, fluctuations, in, population, may, have, been, the, result, of, a, disrupted, ecosystem, and, have, consisted, of, outbreak, populations, much, larger, than, those, common, in, pre, european, times, the, authors, of, the, 2014, genetic, study, note, that, a, similar, analysis, of, the, human, population, size, arrives, at, an, effective, population, size, of, between, 9, 000, and, 17, 000, individuals, or, approximately, 1, 550, 000th, of, the, peak, total, human, population, size, of, 7, billion, cited, in, the, study, for, a, 2017, genetic, study, the, authors, sequenced, the, genomes, of, two, additional, passenger, pigeons, as, well, as, analyzing, the, mitochondrial, dna, of, 41, individuals, this, study, found, evidence, that, the, passenger, pigeon, population, had, been, stable, for, at, least, the, previous, 20, 000, years, the, study, also, found, that, the, size, of, the, passenger, pigeon, population, over, that, time, period, was, larger, than, the, found, in, the, 2014, genetic, study, however, the, 2017, study, s, conservative, estimate, of, an, effective, population, size, of, 13, million, birds, is, still, only, about, 1, 300th, of, the, bird, s, estimated, historic, population, of, approximately, 3, 5, billion, before, their, 19th, century, decline, and, eventual, extinction, a, similar, study, inferring, human, population, size, from, genetics, published, in, 2008, and, using, human, mitochondrial, dna, and, bayesian, coalescent, inference, methods, showed, considerable, accuracy, in, reflecting, overall, patterns, of, human, population, growth, as, compared, to, data, deduced, by, other, means, though, the, study, arrived, at, a, human, effective, population, size, as, of, 1600, ad, for, africa, eurasia, and, the, americas, combined, that, was, roughly, 1, 1000, of, the, census, population, estimate, for, the, same, time, and, area, based, on, anthropological, and, historical, evidence, the, 2017, passenger, pigeon, genetic, study, also, found, that, in, spite, of, its, large, population, size, the, genetic, diversity, was, very, low, in, the, species, the, authors, suggested, that, this, was, a, side, effect, of, natural, selection, which, theory, and, previous, empirical, studies, suggested, could, have, a, particularly, great, impact, on, species, with, very, large, and, cohesive, populations, natural, selection, can, reduce, genetic, diversity, over, extended, regions, of, a, genome, through, selective, sweeps, or, background, selection, the, authors, found, evidence, of, a, faster, rate, of, adaptive, evolution, and, faster, removal, of, harmful, mutations, in, passenger, pigeons, compared, to, band, tailed, pigeons, which, are, some, of, passenger, pigeons, closest, living, relatives, they, also, found, evidence, of, lower, genetic, diversity, in, regions, of, the, passenger, pigeon, genome, that, have, lower, rates, of, genetic, recombination, this, is, expected, if, natural, selection, via, selective, sweeps, or, background, selection, reduced, their, genetic, diversity, but, not, if, population, instability, did, the, study, concluded, that, earlier, suggestion, that, population, instability, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, the, species, was, invalid, evolutionary, biologist, a, townsend, peterson, said, of, the, two, passenger, pigeon, genetic, studies, published, in, 2014, and, 2017, that, though, the, idea, of, extreme, fluctuations, in, the, passenger, pigeon, population, was, deeply, entrenched, he, was, persuaded, by, the, 2017, study, s, argument, due, to, its, in, depth, analysis, and, massive, data, resources, a, communally, roosting, species, the, passenger, pigeon, chose, roosting, sites, that, could, provide, shelter, and, enough, food, to, sustain, their, large, numbers, for, an, indefinite, period, the, time, spent, at, one, roosting, site, may, have, depended, on, the, extent, of, human, persecution, weather, conditions, or, other, unknown, factors, roosts, ranged, in, size, and, extent, from, a, few, acres, to, 260, km, 2, 100, sq, mi, or, greater, some, roosting, areas, would, be, reused, for, subsequent, years, others, would, only, be, used, once, the, passenger, pigeon, roosted, in, such, numbers, that, even, thick, tree, branches, would, break, under, the, strain, the, birds, frequently, piled, on, top, of, each, other, s, backs, to, roost, they, rested, in, a, slumped, position, that, hid, their, feet, they, slept, with, their, bills, concealed, by, the, feathers, in, the, middle, of, the, breast, while, holding, their, tail, at, a, 45, degree, angle, dung, could, accumulate, under, a, roosting, site, to, a, depth, of, over, 0, 3, m, 1, 0, ft, if, the, pigeon, became, alert, it, would, often, stretch, out, its, head, and, neck, in, line, with, its, body, and, tail, then, nod, its, head, in, a, circular, pattern, when, aggravated, by, another, pigeon, it, raised, its, wings, threateningly, but, passenger, pigeons, almost, never, actually, fought, the, pigeon, bathed, in, shallow, water, and, afterwards, lay, on, each, side, in, turn, and, raised, the, opposite, wing, to, dry, it, the, passenger, pigeon, drank, at, least, once, a, day, typically, at, dawn, by, fully, inserting, its, bill, into, lakes, small, ponds, and, streams, pigeons, were, seen, perching, on, top, of, each, other, to, access, water, and, if, necessary, the, species, could, alight, on, open, water, to, drink, one, of, the, primary, causes, of, natural, mortality, was, the, weather, and, every, spring, many, individuals, froze, to, death, after, migrating, north, too, early, in, captivity, a, passenger, pigeon, was, capable, of, living, at, least, 15, years, martha, the, last, known, living, passenger, pigeon, was, at, least, 17, and, possibly, as, old, as, 29, when, she, died, it, is, undocumented, how, long, a, wild, pigeon, lived, the, bird, is, believed, to, have, played, a, significant, ecological, role, in, the, composition, of, pre, columbian, forests, of, eastern, north, america, for, instance, while, the, passenger, pigeon, was, extant, forests, were, dominated, by, white, oaks, this, species, germinated, in, the, fall, therefore, making, its, seeds, almost, useless, as, a, food, source, during, the, spring, breeding, season, while, red, oaks, produced, acorns, during, the, spring, which, were, devoured, by, the, pigeons, the, absence, of, the, passenger, pigeon, s, seed, consumption, may, have, contributed, to, the, modern, dominance, of, red, oaks, due, to, the, immense, amount, of, dung, present, at, roosting, sites, few, plants, grew, for, years, after, the, pigeons, left, also, the, accumulation, of, flammable, debris, such, as, limbs, broken, from, trees, and, foliage, killed, by, excrement, at, these, sites, may, have, increased, both, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, forest, fires, which, would, have, favored, fire, tolerant, species, such, as, bur, oaks, black, oaks, and, white, oaks, over, less, fire, tolerant, species, such, as, red, oaks, thus, helping, to, explain, the, change, in, the, composition, of, eastern, forests, since, the, passenger, pigeon, s, extinction, from, white, oaks, bur, oaks, and, black, oaks, predominating, in, presettlement, forests, to, the, dramatic, expansion, of, red, oaks, today, a, study, released, in, 2018, concluded, that, the, vast, numbers, of, passenger, pigeons, present, for, tens, of, thousands, of, years, would, have, influenced, the, evolution, of, the, tree, species, whose, seeds, they, ate, those, masting, trees, that, produced, seeds, during, the, spring, nesting, season, such, as, red, oaks, evolved, so, that, some, portion, of, their, seeds, would, be, too, large, for, passenger, pigeons, to, swallow, thus, allowing, some, of, their, seeds, to, escape, predation, and, grow, new, trees, white, oak, in, contrast, with, its, seeds, sized, consistently, in, the, edible, range, evolved, an, irregular, masting, pattern, that, took, place, in, the, fall, when, fewer, passenger, pigeons, would, have, been, present, the, study, further, concluded, that, this, allowed, white, oaks, to, be, the, dominant, tree, species, in, regions, where, passenger, pigeons, were, commonly, present, in, the, spring, with, the, large, numbers, in, passenger, pigeon, flocks, the, excrement, they, produced, was, enough, to, destroy, surface, level, vegetation, at, long, term, roosting, sites, while, adding, high, quantities, of, nutrients, to, the, ecosystem, because, of, this, along, with, the, breaking, of, tree, limbs, under, their, collective, weight, and, the, great, amount, of, mast, they, consumed, passenger, pigeons, are, thought, to, have, influenced, both, the, structure, of, eastern, forests, and, the, composition, of, the, species, present, there, due, to, these, influences, some, ecologists, have, considered, the, passenger, pigeon, a, keystone, species, with, the, disappearance, of, their, vast, flocks, leaving, a, major, gap, in, the, ecosystem, their, role, in, creating, forest, disturbances, has, been, linked, to, greater, vertebrate, diversity, in, forests, by, creating, more, niches, for, animals, to, fill, to, help, fill, that, ecological, gap, it, has, been, proposed, that, modern, land, managers, attempt, to, replicate, some, of, their, effects, on, the, ecosystem, by, creating, openings, in, forest, canopies, to, provide, more, understory, light, the, american, chestnut, trees, that, provided, much, of, the, mast, on, which, the, passenger, pigeon, fed, was, itself, almost, driven, to, extinction, by, an, imported, asian, fungus, chestnut, blight, around, 1905, as, many, as, thirty, billion, trees, are, thought, to, have, died, as, a, result, in, the, following, decades, but, this, did, not, affect, the, passenger, pigeon, which, was, already, extinct, in, the, wild, at, the, time, after, the, disappearance, of, the, passenger, pigeon, the, population, of, another, acorn, feeding, species, the, white, footed, mouse, grew, exponentially, because, of, the, increased, availability, of, the, seeds, of, the, oak, beech, and, chestnut, trees, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, extinction, of, passenger, pigeons, may, have, increased, the, prevalence, of, tick, borne, lyme, disease, in, modern, times, as, white, footed, mice, are, the, reservoir, hosts, of, borrelia, burgdorferi, beeches, and, oaks, produced, the, mast, needed, to, support, nesting, and, roosting, flocks, the, passenger, pigeon, changed, its, diet, depending, on, the, season, in, the, fall, winter, and, spring, it, mainly, ate, beechnuts, acorns, and, chestnuts, during, the, summer, berries, and, softer, fruits, such, as, blueberries, grapes, cherries, mulberries, pokeberries, and, bunchberry, became, the, main, objects, of, its, consumption, it, also, ate, worms, caterpillars, snails, and, other, invertebrates, particularly, while, breeding, it, took, advantage, of, cultivated, grains, particularly, buckwheat, when, it, found, them, it, was, especially, fond, of, salt, which, it, ingested, either, from, brackish, springs, or, salty, soil, mast, occurs, in, large, quantities, in, different, places, at, different, times, and, rarely, in, consecutive, years, which, is, one, of, the, reasons, why, the, large, flocks, were, constantly, on, the, move, as, mast, is, produced, during, autumn, there, would, have, to, be, a, large, amount, of, it, left, by, the, summer, when, the, young, were, reared, it, is, unknown, how, they, located, this, fluctuating, food, source, but, their, eyesight, and, flight, powers, helped, them, survey, large, areas, for, places, that, could, provide, food, enough, for, a, temporary, stay, the, passenger, pigeon, foraged, in, flocks, of, tens, or, hundreds, of, thousands, of, individuals, that, overturned, leaves, dirt, and, snow, with, their, bills, in, search, of, food, one, observer, described, the, motion, of, such, a, flock, in, search, of, mast, as, having, a, rolling, appearance, as, birds, in, the, back, of, the, flock, flew, overhead, to, the, front, of, the, flock, dropping, leaves, and, grass, in, flight, the, flocks, had, wide, leading, edges, to, better, scan, the, landscape, for, food, sources, when, nuts, on, a, tree, loosened, from, their, caps, a, pigeon, would, land, on, a, branch, and, while, flapping, vigorously, to, stay, balanced, grab, the, nut, pull, it, loose, from, its, cap, and, swallow, it, whole, collectively, a, foraging, flock, was, capable, of, removing, nearly, all, fruits, and, nuts, from, their, path, birds, in, the, back, of, the, flock, flew, to, the, front, in, order, to, pick, over, unsearched, ground, however, birds, never, ventured, far, from, the, flock, and, hurried, back, if, they, became, isolated, it, is, believed, that, the, pigeons, used, social, cues, to, identify, abundant, sources, of, food, and, a, flock, of, pigeons, that, saw, others, feeding, on, the, ground, often, joined, them, during, the, day, the, birds, left, the, roosting, forest, to, forage, on, more, open, land, they, regularly, flew, 100, to, 130, km, 62, to, 81, mi, away, from, their, roost, daily, in, search, of, food, and, some, pigeons, reportedly, traveled, as, far, as, 160, km, 99, mi, leaving, the, roosting, area, early, and, returning, at, night, the, passenger, pigeon, s, very, elastic, mouth, and, throat, and, a, joint, in, the, lower, bill, enabled, it, to, swallow, acorns, whole, it, could, store, large, quantities, of, food, in, its, crop, which, could, expand, to, about, the, size, of, an, orange, causing, the, neck, to, bulge, and, allowing, a, bird, quickly, to, grab, any, food, it, discovered, the, crop, was, described, as, being, capable, of, holding, at, least, 17, acorns, or, 28, beechnuts, 11, grains, of, corn, 100, maple, seeds, plus, other, material, it, was, estimated, that, a, passenger, pigeon, needed, to, eat, about, 61, cm, 3, 3, 7, in, 3, of, food, a, day, to, survive, if, shot, a, pigeon, with, a, crop, full, of, nuts, would, fall, to, the, ground, with, a, sound, described, as, like, the, rattle, of, a, bag, of, marbles, after, feeding, the, pigeons, perched, on, branches, and, digested, the, food, stored, in, their, crop, overnight, the, pigeon, could, eat, and, digest, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, of, acorns, per, day, at, the, historic, population, of, three, billion, passenger, pigeons, this, amounted, to, 210, 000, 000, l, 55, 000, 000, us, gal, of, food, a, day, the, pigeon, could, regurgitate, food, from, its, crop, when, more, desirable, food, became, available, a, 2018, study, found, that, the, dietary, range, of, the, passenger, pigeon, was, restricted, to, certain, sizes, of, seed, due, to, the, size, of, its, gape, this, would, have, prevented, it, from, eating, some, of, the, seeds, of, trees, such, as, red, oaks, the, black, oak, and, the, american, chestnut, specifically, the, study, found, that, between, 13, and, 69, of, red, oak, seeds, were, too, large, for, passenger, pigeons, to, have, swallowed, that, only, a, small, proportion, of, the, seeds, of, black, oaks, and, american, chestnuts, were, too, large, for, the, birds, to, consume, and, that, all, white, oak, seeds, were, sized, within, an, edible, range, they, also, found, that, seeds, would, be, completely, destroyed, during, digestion, which, therefore, hindered, dispersal, of, seeds, this, way, instead, passenger, pigeons, may, have, spread, seeds, by, regurgitation, or, after, dying, other, than, finding, roosting, sites, the, migrations, of, the, passenger, pigeon, were, connected, with, finding, places, appropriate, for, this, communally, breeding, bird, to, nest, and, raise, its, young, it, is, not, certain, how, many, times, a, year, the, birds, bred, once, seems, most, likely, but, some, accounts, suggest, more, the, nesting, period, lasted, around, four, to, six, weeks, the, flock, arrived, at, a, nesting, ground, around, march, in, southern, latitudes, and, some, time, later, in, more, northern, areas, the, pigeon, had, no, site, fidelity, often, choosing, to, nest, in, a, different, location, each, year, the, formation, of, a, nesting, colony, did, not, necessarily, take, place, until, several, months, after, the, pigeons, arrived, on, their, breeding, grounds, typically, during, late, march, april, or, may, the, colonies, which, were, known, as, cities, were, immense, ranging, from, 49, ha, 120, acres, to, thousands, of, hectares, in, size, and, were, often, long, and, narrow, in, shape, l, shaped, with, a, few, areas, untouched, for, unknown, reasons, due, to, the, topography, they, were, rarely, continuous, since, no, accurate, data, was, recorded, it, is, not, possible, to, give, more, than, estimates, on, the, size, and, population, of, these, nesting, areas, but, most, accounts, mention, colonies, containing, millions, of, birds, the, largest, nesting, area, ever, recorded, was, in, central, wisconsin, in, 1871, it, was, reported, as, covering, 2, 200, km, 2, 850, sq, mi, with, the, number, of, birds, nesting, there, estimated, to, be, around, 136, 000, 000, as, well, as, these, cities, there, were, regular, reports, of, much, smaller, flocks, or, even, individual, pairs, setting, up, a, nesting, site, the, birds, do, not, seem, to, have, formed, as, vast, breeding, colonies, at, the, periphery, of, their, range, courtship, took, place, at, the, nesting, colony, unlike, other, pigeons, courtship, took, place, on, a, branch, or, perch, the, male, with, a, flourish, of, the, wings, made, a, keck, call, while, near, a, female, the, male, then, gripped, tightly, to, the, branch, and, vigorously, flapped, his, wings, up, and, down, when, the, male, was, close, to, the, female, he, then, pressed, against, her, on, the, perch, with, his, head, held, high, and, pointing, at, her, if, receptive, the, female, pressed, back, against, the, male, when, ready, to, mate, the, pair, preened, each, other, this, was, followed, by, the, birds, billing, in, which, the, female, inserted, its, bill, into, and, clasped, the, male, s, bill, shook, for, a, second, and, separated, quickly, while, standing, next, to, each, other, the, male, then, scrambled, onto, the, female, s, back, and, copulated, which, was, then, followed, by, soft, clucking, and, occasionally, more, preening, john, james, audubon, described, the, courtship, of, the, passenger, pigeon, as, follows, thither, the, countless, myriads, resort, and, prepare, to, fulfill, one, of, the, great, laws, of, nature, at, this, period, the, note, of, the, pigeon, is, a, soft, coo, coo, coo, coo, much, shorter, than, that, of, the, domestic, species, the, common, notes, resemble, the, monosyllables, kee, kee, kee, kee, the, first, being, the, loudest, the, others, gradually, diminishing, in, power, the, male, assumes, a, pompous, demeanor, and, follows, the, female, whether, on, the, ground, or, on, the, branches, with, spread, tail, and, drooping, wings, which, it, rubs, against, the, part, over, which, it, is, moving, the, body, is, elevated, the, throat, swells, the, eyes, sparkle, he, continues, his, notes, and, now, and, then, rises, on, the, wing, and, flies, a, few, yards, to, approach, the, fugitive, and, timorous, female, like, the, domestic, pigeon, and, other, species, they, caress, each, other, by, billing, in, which, action, the, bill, of, the, one, is, introduced, transversely, into, that, of, the, other, and, both, parties, alternately, disgorge, the, contents, of, their, crop, by, repeated, efforts, after, observing, captive, birds, wallace, craig, found, that, this, species, did, less, charging, and, strutting, than, other, pigeons, as, it, was, awkward, on, the, ground, and, thought, it, probable, that, no, food, was, transferred, during, their, brief, billing, unlike, in, other, pigeons, and, he, therefore, considered, audubon, s, description, partially, based, on, analogy, with, other, pigeons, as, well, as, imagination, nests, were, built, immediately, after, pair, formation, and, took, two, to, four, days, to, construct, this, process, was, highly, synchronized, within, a, colony, the, female, chose, the, nesting, site, by, sitting, on, it, and, flicking, her, wings, the, male, then, carefully, selected, nesting, materials, typically, twigs, and, handed, them, to, the, female, over, her, back, the, male, then, went, in, search, of, more, nesting, material, while, the, female, constructed, the, nest, beneath, herself, nests, were, built, between, 2, 0, and, 20, 1, m, 6, 6, and, 65, 9, ft, above, the, ground, though, typically, above, 4, 0, m, 13, 1, ft, and, were, made, of, 70, to, 110, twigs, woven, together, to, create, a, loose, shallow, bowl, through, which, the, egg, could, easily, be, seen, this, bowl, was, then, typically, lined, with, finer, twigs, the, nests, were, about, 150, mm, 5, 9, in, wide, 61, mm, 2, 4, in, high, and, 19, mm, 0, 75, in, deep, though, the, nest, has, been, described, as, crude, and, flimsy, compared, to, those, of, many, other, birds, remains, of, nests, could, be, found, at, sites, where, nesting, had, taken, place, several, years, prior, nearly, every, tree, capable, of, supporting, nests, had, them, often, more, than, 50, per, tree, one, hemlock, was, recorded, as, holding, 317, nests, the, nests, were, placed, on, strong, branches, close, to, the, tree, trunks, some, accounts, state, that, ground, under, the, nesting, area, looked, as, if, it, had, been, swept, clean, due, to, all, the, twigs, being, collected, at, the, same, time, yet, this, area, would, also, have, been, covered, in, dung, as, both, sexes, took, care, of, the, nest, the, pairs, were, monogamous, for, the, duration, of, the, nesting, generally, the, eggs, were, laid, during, the, first, two, weeks, of, april, across, the, pigeon, s, range, each, female, laid, its, egg, immediately, or, almost, immediately, after, the, nest, was, completed, sometimes, the, pigeon, was, forced, to, lay, it, on, the, ground, if, the, nest, was, not, complete, the, normal, clutch, size, appears, to, have, been, a, single, egg, but, there, is, some, uncertainty, about, this, as, two, have, also, been, reported, from, the, same, nests, occasionally, a, second, female, laid, its, egg, in, another, female, s, nest, resulting, in, two, eggs, being, present, the, egg, was, white, and, oval, shaped, and, averaged, 40, by, 34, mm, 1, 6, by, 1, 3, in, in, size, if, the, egg, was, lost, it, was, possible, for, the, pigeon, to, lay, a, replacement, egg, within, a, week, a, whole, colony, was, known, to, re, nest, after, a, snowstorm, forced, them, to, abandon, their, original, colony, the, egg, was, incubated, by, both, parents, for, 12, to, 14, days, with, the, male, incubating, it, from, midmorning, to, midafternoon, and, the, female, incubating, it, for, the, rest, of, the, time, upon, hatching, the, nestling, or, squab, was, blind, and, sparsely, covered, with, yellow, hairlike, down, the, nestling, developed, quickly, and, within, 14, days, weighed, as, much, as, its, parents, during, this, brooding, period, both, parents, took, care, of, the, nestling, with, the, male, attending, in, the, middle, of, the, day, and, the, female, at, other, times, the, nestlings, were, fed, crop, milk, a, substance, similar, to, curd, produced, in, the, crops, of, the, parent, birds, exclusively, for, the, first, days, after, hatching, adult, food, was, gradually, introduced, after, three, to, six, days, after, 13, to, 15, days, the, parents, fed, the, nestling, for, a, last, time, and, then, abandoned, it, leaving, the, nesting, area, en, masse, the, nestling, begged, in, the, nest, for, a, day, or, two, before, climbing, from, the, nest, and, fluttering, to, the, ground, whereafter, it, moved, around, avoided, obstacles, and, begged, for, food, from, nearby, adults, it, was, another, three, or, four, days, before, it, fledged, the, entire, nesting, cycle, lasted, about, 30, days, it, is, unknown, whether, colonies, re, nested, after, a, successful, nesting, the, passenger, pigeon, sexually, matured, during, its, first, year, and, bred, the, following, spring, alfred, russel, wallace, in, his, historic, 1858, paper, on, the, tendency, of, species, to, form, varieties, and, on, the, perpetuation, of, varieties, and, species, by, natural, means, of, selection, used, the, passenger, pigeon, as, an, example, of, an, immensely, successful, species, despite, laying, fewer, eggs, than, most, other, birds, it, would, therefore, appear, that, as, far, as, the, continuance, of, the, species, and, the, keeping, up, the, average, number, of, individuals, are, concerned, large, broods, are, superfluous, on, the, average, all, above, one, become, food, for, hawks, and, kites, wild, cats, and, weasels, or, perish, of, cold, and, hunger, as, winter, comes, on, this, is, strikingly, proved, by, the, case, of, particular, species, for, we, find, that, their, abundance, in, individuals, bears, no, relation, whatever, to, their, fertility, in, producing, offspring, perhaps, the, most, remarkable, instance, of, an, immense, bird, population, is, that, of, the, passenger, pigeon, of, the, united, states, which, lays, only, one, or, at, most, two, eggs, and, is, said, to, rear, generally, but, one, young, one, why, is, this, bird, so, extraordinarily, abundant, while, others, producing, two, or, three, times, as, many, young, are, much, less, plentiful, the, explanation, is, not, difficult, the, food, most, congenial, to, this, species, and, on, which, it, thrives, best, is, abundantly, distributed, over, a, very, extensive, region, offering, such, differences, of, soil, and, climate, that, in, one, part, or, another, of, the, area, the, supply, never, fails, the, bird, is, capable, of, a, very, rapid, and, long, continued, flight, so, that, it, can, pass, without, fatigue, over, the, whole, of, the, district, it, inhabits, and, as, soon, as, the, supply, of, food, begins, to, fail, in, one, place, is, able, to, discover, a, fresh, feeding, ground, this, example, strikingly, shows, us, that, the, procuring, a, constant, supply, of, wholesome, food, is, almost, the, sole, condition, requisite, for, ensuring, the, rapid, increase, of, a, given, species, since, neither, the, limited, fecundity, nor, the, unrestrained, attacks, of, birds, of, prey, and, of, man, are, here, sufficient, to, check, it, in, no, other, birds, are, these, peculiar, circumstances, so, strikingly, combined, either, their, food, is, more, liable, to, failure, or, they, have, not, sufficient, power, of, wing, to, search, for, it, over, an, extensive, area, or, during, some, season, of, the, year, it, becomes, very, scarce, and, less, wholesome, substitutes, have, to, be, found, and, thus, though, more, fertile, in, offspring, they, can, never, increase, beyond, the, supply, of, food, in, the, least, favourable, seasons, nesting, colonies, attracted, large, numbers, of, predators, including, american, minks, neogale, vison, long, tailed, weasels, neogale, frenata, american, martens, martes, americana, and, raccoons, procyon, lotor, that, preyed, on, eggs, and, nestlings, birds, of, prey, such, as, owls, hawks, and, eagles, that, preyed, on, nestlings, and, adults, and, wolves, canis, lupus, foxes, urocyon, cinereoargenteus, and, vulpes, vulpes, bobcats, lynx, rufus, american, black, bears, ursus, americanus, and, cougars, puma, concolor, that, preyed, on, injured, adults, and, fallen, nestlings, hawks, of, the, genus, accipiter, and, falcons, pursued, and, preyed, upon, pigeons, in, flight, which, in, turn, executed, complex, aerial, maneuvers, to, avoid, them, cooper, s, hawk, accipiter, cooperii, was, known, as, the, great, pigeon, hawk, due, to, its, successes, and, these, hawks, allegedly, followed, migrating, passenger, pigeons, while, many, predators, were, drawn, to, the, flocks, individual, pigeons, were, largely, protected, due, to, the, sheer, size, of, the, flock, and, overall, little, damage, could, be, inflicted, on, the, flock, by, predation, despite, the, number, of, predators, nesting, colonies, were, so, large, that, they, were, estimated, to, have, a, 90, success, rate, if, not, disturbed, after, being, abandoned, and, leaving, the, nest, the, very, fat, juveniles, were, vulnerable, to, predators, until, they, were, able, to, fly, the, sheer, number, of, juveniles, on, the, ground, meant, that, only, a, small, percentage, of, them, were, killed, predator, satiation, may, therefore, be, one, of, the, reasons, for, the, extremely, social, habits, and, communal, breeding, of, the, species, two, parasites, have, been, recorded, on, passenger, pigeons, one, species, of, phtilopterid, louse, columbicola, extinctus, was, originally, thought, to, have, lived, on, just, passenger, pigeons, and, to, have, become, coextinct, with, them, this, was, proven, inaccurate, in, 1999, when, c, extinctus, was, rediscovered, living, on, band, tailed, pigeons, this, and, the, fact, that, the, related, louse, c, angustus, is, mainly, found, on, cuckoo, doves, further, supports, the, relation, between, these, pigeons, as, the, phylogeny, of, lice, broadly, mirrors, that, of, their, hosts, another, louse, campanulotes, defectus, was, thought, to, have, been, unique, to, the, passenger, pigeon, but, is, now, believed, to, have, been, a, case, of, a, contaminated, specimen, as, the, species, is, considered, to, be, the, still, extant, campanulotes, flavus, of, australia, there, is, no, record, of, a, wild, pigeon, dying, of, either, disease, or, parasites, for, fifteen, thousand, years, or, more, before, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, the, americas, passenger, pigeons, and, native, americans, coexisted, in, the, forests, of, what, would, later, become, the, eastern, part, of, the, continental, united, states, a, study, published, in, 2008, found, that, throughout, most, of, the, holocene, native, american, land, use, practices, greatly, influenced, forest, composition, the, regular, use, of, prescribed, burn, the, girdling, of, unwanted, trees, and, the, planting, and, tending, of, favored, trees, suppressed, the, populations, of, a, number, of, tree, species, that, did, not, produce, nuts, acorns, or, fruit, while, increasing, the, populations, of, numerous, tree, species, that, did, in, addition, the, burning, away, of, forest, floor, litter, made, these, foods, easier, to, find, once, they, had, fallen, from, the, trees, some, have, argued, that, such, native, american, land, use, practices, increased, the, populations, of, various, animal, species, including, the, passenger, pigeon, by, increasing, the, food, available, to, them, while, elsewhere, it, has, been, claimed, that, by, hunting, passenger, pigeons, and, competing, with, them, for, some, kinds, of, nuts, and, acorns, native, americans, suppressed, their, population, size, genetic, research, may, shed, some, light, on, this, question, a, 2017, study, of, passenger, pigeon, dna, found, that, the, passenger, pigeon, population, size, was, stable, for, 20, 000, years, prior, to, its, 19th, century, decline, and, subsequent, extinction, while, a, 2016, study, of, ancient, native, american, dna, found, that, the, native, american, population, went, through, a, period, of, rapid, expansion, increasing, 60, fold, starting, about, 13, 16, thousand, years, ago, if, both, of, these, studies, are, correct, then, a, great, change, in, the, size, of, the, native, american, population, had, no, apparent, impact, on, the, size, of, the, passenger, pigeon, population, this, suggests, that, the, net, effect, of, native, american, activities, on, passenger, pigeon, population, size, was, neutral, the, passenger, pigeon, played, a, religious, role, for, some, northern, native, american, tribes, the, wyandot, people, or, huron, believed, that, every, twelve, years, during, the, feast, of, the, dead, the, souls, of, the, dead, changed, into, passenger, pigeons, which, were, then, hunted, and, eaten, before, hunting, the, juvenile, pigeons, the, seneca, people, made, an, offering, of, wampum, and, brooches, to, the, old, passenger, pigeons, these, were, placed, in, a, small, kettle, or, other, receptacle, by, a, smoky, fire, the, ho, chunk, people, considered, the, passenger, pigeon, to, be, the, bird, of, the, chief, as, they, were, served, whenever, the, chieftain, gave, a, feast, the, seneca, people, believed, that, a, white, pigeon, was, the, chief, of, the, passenger, pigeon, colony, and, that, a, council, of, birds, decided, that, the, pigeons, had, to, give, their, bodies, to, the, seneca, because, they, were, the, only, birds, that, nested, in, colonies, the, seneca, developed, a, pigeon, dance, as, a, way, of, showing, their, gratitude, french, explorer, jacques, cartier, was, the, first, european, to, report, on, passenger, pigeons, during, his, voyage, in, 1534, the, bird, was, subsequently, observed, and, noted, by, historical, figures, such, as, samuel, de, champlain, and, cotton, mather, most, early, accounts, dwell, on, the, vast, number, of, pigeons, the, resulting, darkened, skies, and, the, enormous, amount, of, hunted, birds, 50, 000, birds, were, reportedly, sold, at, a, boston, market, in, 1771, the, early, colonists, thought, that, large, flights, of, pigeons, would, be, followed, by, ill, fortune, or, sickness, when, the, pigeons, wintered, outside, of, their, normal, range, some, believed, that, they, would, have, a, sickly, summer, and, autumn, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, various, parts, of, the, pigeon, were, thought, to, have, medicinal, properties, the, blood, was, supposed, to, be, good, for, eye, disorders, the, powdered, stomach, lining, was, used, to, treat, dysentery, and, the, dung, was, used, to, treat, a, variety, of, ailments, including, headaches, stomach, pains, and, lethargy, though, they, did, not, last, as, long, as, the, feathers, of, a, goose, the, feathers, of, the, passenger, pigeon, were, frequently, used, for, bedding, pigeon, feather, beds, were, so, popular, that, for, a, time, in, saint, j, r, me, quebec, every, dowry, included, a, bed, and, pillows, made, of, pigeon, feathers, in, 1822, one, family, in, chautauqua, county, new, york, killed, 4, 000, pigeons, in, a, day, solely, for, this, purpose, the, passenger, pigeon, was, featured, in, the, writings, of, many, significant, early, naturalists, as, well, as, accompanying, illustrations, mark, catesby, s, 1731, illustration, the, first, published, depiction, of, this, bird, is, somewhat, crude, according, to, some, later, commentators, the, original, watercolor, that, the, engraving, is, based, on, was, bought, by, the, british, royal, family, in, 1768, along, with, the, rest, of, catesby, s, watercolors, the, naturalists, alexander, wilson, and, john, james, audubon, both, witnessed, large, pigeon, migrations, first, hand, and, published, detailed, accounts, wherein, both, attempted, to, deduce, the, total, number, of, birds, involved, the, most, famous, and, often, reproduced, depiction, of, the, passenger, pigeon, is, audubon, s, illustration, handcolored, aquatint, in, his, book, the, birds, of, america, published, between, 1827, and, 1838, audubon, s, image, has, been, praised, for, its, artistic, qualities, but, criticized, for, its, supposed, scientific, inaccuracies, as, wallace, craig, and, r, w, shufeldt, among, others, pointed, out, the, birds, are, shown, perched, and, billing, one, above, the, other, whereas, they, would, instead, have, done, this, side, by, side, the, male, would, be, the, one, passing, food, to, the, female, and, the, male, s, tail, would, not, be, spread, craig, and, shufeldt, instead, cited, illustrations, by, american, artist, louis, agassiz, fuertes, and, japanese, artist, k, hayashi, as, more, accurate, depictions, of, the, bird, illustrations, of, the, passenger, pigeon, were, often, drawn, after, stuffed, birds, and, charles, r, knight, is, the, only, serious, artist, known, to, have, drawn, the, species, from, life, he, did, so, on, at, least, two, occasions, in, 1903, he, drew, a, bird, possibly, in, one, of, the, three, aviaries, with, surviving, birds, and, some, time, before, 1914, he, drew, martha, the, last, individual, in, the, cincinnati, zoo, the, bird, has, been, written, about, including, in, poems, songs, and, fiction, and, illustrated, by, many, notable, writers, and, artists, and, is, depicted, in, art, to, this, day, for, example, in, walton, ford, s, 2002, painting, falling, bough, and, national, medal, of, arts, winner, john, a, ruthven, s, 2014, mural, in, cincinnati, which, commemorates, the, 100th, anniversary, of, martha, s, death, the, centennial, of, its, extinction, was, used, by, the, project, passenger, pigeon, outreach, group, to, spread, awareness, about, human, induced, extinction, and, to, recognize, its, relevance, in, the, 21st, century, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, passenger, pigeon, could, be, used, as, a, flagship, species, to, spread, awareness, of, other, threatened, but, less, well, known, north, american, birds, the, passenger, pigeon, was, an, important, source, of, food, for, the, people, of, north, america, native, americans, ate, pigeons, and, tribes, near, nesting, colonies, would, sometimes, move, to, live, closer, to, them, and, eat, the, juveniles, killing, them, at, night, with, long, poles, many, native, americans, were, careful, not, to, disturb, the, adult, pigeons, and, instead, ate, only, the, juveniles, as, they, were, afraid, that, the, adults, might, desert, their, nesting, grounds, in, some, tribes, disturbing, the, adult, pigeons, was, considered, a, crime, away, from, the, nests, large, nets, were, used, to, capture, adult, pigeons, sometimes, up, to, 800, at, a, time, low, flying, pigeons, could, be, killed, by, throwing, sticks, or, stones, at, one, site, in, oklahoma, the, pigeons, leaving, their, roost, every, morning, flew, low, enough, that, the, cherokee, could, throw, clubs, into, their, midst, which, caused, the, lead, pigeons, to, try, to, turn, aside, and, in, the, process, created, a, blockade, that, resulted, in, a, large, mass, of, flying, easily, hit, pigeons, among, the, game, birds, passenger, pigeons, were, second, only, to, the, wild, turkey, meleagris, gallopavo, in, terms, of, importance, for, the, native, americans, living, in, the, southeastern, united, states, the, bird, s, fat, was, stored, often, in, large, quantities, and, used, as, butter, archaeological, evidence, supports, the, idea, that, native, americans, ate, the, pigeons, frequently, prior, to, colonization, what, may, be, the, earliest, account, of, europeans, hunting, passenger, pigeons, dates, to, january, 1565, when, the, french, explorer, ren, laudonni, re, wrote, of, killing, close, to, 10, 000, of, them, around, fort, caroline, in, a, matter, of, weeks, there, came, to, us, a, manna, of, wood, pigeons, in, such, great, numbers, that, over, a, span, of, about, seven, weeks, each, day, we, killed, more, than, two, hundred, with, arquebuses, in, the, woods, around, our, fort, this, amounted, to, about, one, passenger, pigeon, per, day, for, each, person, in, the, fort, after, european, colonization, the, passenger, pigeon, was, hunted, with, more, intensive, methods, than, the, more, sustainable, methods, practiced, by, the, natives, yet, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, species, was, rare, prior, to, 1492, and, that, the, subsequent, increase, in, their, numbers, may, be, due, to, the, decrease, in, the, native, american, population, who, as, well, as, hunting, the, birds, competed, with, them, for, mast, caused, by, european, immigration, and, the, supplementary, food, agricultural, crops, the, immigrants, imported, a, theory, for, which, joel, greenberg, offered, a, detailed, rebuttal, in, his, book, a, feathered, river, across, the, sky, the, passenger, pigeon, was, of, particular, value, on, the, frontier, and, some, settlements, counted, on, its, meat, to, support, their, population, the, flavor, of, the, flesh, of, passenger, pigeons, varied, depending, on, how, they, were, prepared, in, general, juveniles, were, thought, to, taste, the, best, followed, by, birds, fattened, in, captivity, and, birds, caught, in, september, and, october, it, was, common, practice, to, fatten, trapped, pigeons, before, eating, them, or, storing, their, bodies, for, winter, dead, pigeons, were, commonly, stored, by, salting, or, pickling, the, bodies, other, times, only, the, breasts, of, the, pigeons, were, kept, in, which, case, they, were, typically, smoked, in, the, early, 19th, century, commercial, hunters, began, netting, and, shooting, the, birds, to, sell, as, food, in, city, markets, and, even, as, pig, fodder, once, pigeon, meat, became, popular, commercial, hunting, started, on, a, prodigious, scale, passenger, pigeons, were, shot, with, such, ease, that, many, did, not, consider, them, to, be, a, game, bird, as, an, amateur, hunter, could, easily, bring, down, six, with, one, shotgun, blast, a, particularly, good, shot, with, both, barrels, of, a, shotgun, at, a, roost, could, kill, 61, birds, the, birds, were, frequently, shot, either, in, flight, during, migration, or, immediately, after, when, they, commonly, perched, in, dead, exposed, trees, hunters, only, had, to, shoot, toward, the, sky, without, aiming, and, many, pigeons, would, be, brought, down, the, pigeons, proved, difficult, to, shoot, head, on, so, hunters, typically, waited, for, the, flocks, to, pass, overhead, before, shooting, them, trenches, were, sometimes, dug, and, filled, with, grain, so, that, a, hunter, could, shoot, the, pigeons, along, this, trench, hunters, largely, outnumbered, trappers, and, hunting, passenger, pigeons, was, a, popular, sport, for, young, boys, in, 1871, a, single, seller, of, ammunition, provided, three, tons, of, powder, and, 16, tons, 32, 000, lb, of, shot, during, a, nesting, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, thousands, of, passenger, pigeons, were, captured, for, use, in, the, sports, shooting, industry, the, pigeons, were, used, as, living, targets, in, shooting, tournaments, such, as, trap, shooting, the, controlled, release, of, birds, from, special, traps, competitions, could, also, consist, of, people, standing, regularly, spaced, while, trying, to, shoot, down, as, many, birds, as, possible, in, a, passing, flock, the, pigeon, was, considered, so, numerous, that, 30, 000, birds, had, to, be, killed, to, claim, the, prize, in, one, competition, there, were, a, wide, variety, of, other, methods, used, to, capture, and, kill, passenger, pigeons, nets, were, propped, up, to, allow, passenger, pigeons, entry, then, closed, by, knocking, loose, the, stick, that, supported, the, opening, trapping, twenty, or, more, pigeons, inside, tunnel, nets, were, also, used, to, great, effect, and, one, particularly, large, net, was, capable, of, catching, 3, 500, pigeons, at, a, time, these, nets, were, used, by, many, farmers, on, their, own, property, as, well, as, by, professional, trappers, food, would, be, placed, on, the, ground, near, the, nets, to, attract, the, pigeons, decoy, or, stool, pigeons, sometimes, blinded, by, having, their, eyelids, sewn, together, were, tied, to, a, stool, when, a, flock, of, pigeons, passed, by, a, cord, would, be, pulled, that, made, the, stool, pigeon, flutter, to, the, ground, making, it, seem, as, if, it, had, found, food, and, the, flock, would, be, lured, into, the, trap, salt, was, also, frequently, used, as, bait, and, many, trappers, set, up, near, salt, springs, at, least, one, trapper, used, alcohol, soaked, grain, as, bait, to, intoxicate, the, birds, and, make, them, easier, to, kill, another, method, of, capture, was, to, hunt, at, a, nesting, colony, particularly, during, the, period, of, a, few, days, after, the, adult, pigeons, abandoned, their, nestlings, but, before, the, nestlings, could, fly, some, hunters, used, sticks, to, poke, the, nestlings, out, of, the, nest, while, others, shot, the, bottom, of, a, nest, with, a, blunt, arrow, to, dislodge, the, pigeon, others, cut, down, a, nesting, tree, in, such, a, way, that, when, it, fell, it, would, also, hit, a, second, nesting, tree, and, dislodge, the, pigeons, within, in, one, case, 6, km, 2, 1, 500, acres, of, large, trees, were, speedily, cut, down, to, get, birds, and, such, methods, were, common, a, severe, method, was, to, set, fire, to, the, base, of, a, tree, nested, with, pigeons, the, adults, would, flee, and, the, juveniles, would, fall, to, the, ground, sulfur, was, sometimes, burned, beneath, the, nesting, tree, to, suffocate, the, birds, which, fell, out, of, the, tree, in, a, weakened, state, by, the, mid, 19th, century, railroads, had, opened, new, opportunities, for, pigeon, hunters, while, previously, was, too, difficult, to, ship, masses, of, pigeons, to, eastern, cities, the, access, provided, by, the, railroad, permitted, pigeon, hunting, to, become, commercialized, an, extensive, telegraph, system, was, introduced, in, the, 1860s, which, improved, communication, across, the, united, states, making, it, easier, to, spread, information, about, the, whereabouts, of, pigeon, flocks, after, being, opened, up, to, the, railroads, the, town, of, plattsburgh, new, york, is, estimated, to, have, shipped, 1, 8, million, pigeons, to, larger, cities, in, 1851, alone, at, a, price, of, 31, to, 56, cents, a, dozen, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, trade, of, passenger, pigeons, had, become, commercialized, large, commission, houses, employed, trappers, known, as, pigeoners, to, follow, the, flocks, of, pigeons, year, round, a, single, hunter, is, reported, to, have, sent, three, million, birds, to, eastern, cities, during, his, career, in, 1874, at, least, 600, people, were, employed, as, pigeon, trappers, a, number, which, grew, to, 1, 200, by, 1881, pigeons, were, caught, in, such, numbers, that, by, 1876, shipments, of, dead, pigeons, were, unable, to, recoup, the, costs, of, the, barrels, and, ice, needed, to, ship, them, the, price, of, a, barrel, full, of, pigeons, dropped, to, below, fifty, cents, due, to, overstocked, markets, passenger, pigeons, were, instead, kept, alive, so, their, meat, would, be, fresh, when, killed, and, sold, once, their, market, value, had, increased, thousands, of, birds, were, kept, in, large, pens, though, the, bad, conditions, led, many, to, die, from, lack, of, food, and, water, and, by, fretting, gnawing, themselves, many, rotted, away, before, they, could, be, sold, hunting, of, passenger, pigeons, was, documented, and, depicted, in, contemporaneous, newspapers, wherein, various, trapping, methods, and, uses, were, featured, the, most, often, reproduced, of, these, illustrations, was, captioned, winter, sports, in, northern, louisiana, shooting, wild, pigeons, and, published, in, 1875, passenger, pigeons, were, also, seen, as, agricultural, pests, since, entire, crops, could, be, destroyed, by, feeding, flocks, the, bird, was, described, as, a, perfect, scourge, by, some, farming, communities, and, hunters, were, employed, to, wage, warfare, on, the, birds, to, save, grain, as, shown, in, another, newspaper, illustration, from, 1867, captioned, as, shooting, wild, pigeons, in, iowa, when, comparing, these, pests, to, the, bison, of, the, great, plains, the, valuable, resource, needed, was, not, the, species, of, animals, but, the, agriculture, which, was, consumed, by, said, animal, the, crops, that, were, eaten, were, seen, as, marketable, calories, proteins, and, nutrients, all, grown, for, the, wrong, species, the, notion, that, the, species, could, be, driven, to, extinction, was, alien, to, the, early, colonists, because, the, number, of, birds, did, not, appear, to, diminish, and, also, because, the, concept, of, extinction, was, yet, to, be, defined, the, bird, seems, to, have, been, slowly, pushed, westward, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, becoming, scarce, or, absent, in, the, east, though, there, were, still, millions, of, birds, in, the, 1850s, the, population, must, have, been, decreasing, in, numbers, for, many, years, though, this, went, unnoticed, due, to, the, apparent, vast, number, of, birds, which, clouded, their, decline, in, 1856, b, n, dict, henry, r, voil, may, have, been, one, of, the, first, writers, to, voice, concern, about, the, fate, of, the, passenger, pigeon, after, witnessing, a, hunt, in, 1847, everything, leads, to, the, belief, that, the, pigeons, which, cannot, endure, isolation, and, are, forced, to, flee, or, to, change, their, way, of, living, according, to, the, rate, at, which, north, america, is, populated, by, the, european, inflow, will, simply, end, by, disappearing, from, this, continent, and, if, the, world, does, not, end, this, before, a, century, i, will, wager, that, the, amateur, of, ornithology, will, find, no, more, wild, pigeons, except, those, in, the, museums, of, natural, history, by, the, 1870s, the, decrease, in, birds, was, noticeable, especially, after, the, last, large, scale, nestings, and, subsequent, slaughters, of, millions, of, birds, in, 1874, and, 1878, by, this, time, large, nestings, only, took, place, in, the, north, around, the, great, lakes, the, last, large, nesting, was, in, petoskey, michigan, in, 1878, following, one, in, pennsylvania, a, few, days, earlier, where, 50, 000, birds, were, killed, each, day, for, nearly, five, months, the, surviving, adults, attempted, a, second, nesting, at, new, sites, but, were, killed, by, professional, hunters, before, they, had, a, chance, to, raise, any, young, scattered, nestings, were, reported, into, the, 1880s, but, the, birds, were, now, wary, and, commonly, abandoned, their, nests, if, persecuted, by, the, time, of, these, last, nestings, laws, had, already, been, enacted, to, protect, the, passenger, pigeon, but, these, proved, ineffective, as, they, were, unclearly, framed, and, hard, to, enforce, h, b, roney, who, witnessed, the, petoskey, slaughter, led, campaigns, to, protect, the, pigeon, but, was, met, with, resistance, and, accusations, that, he, was, exaggerating, the, severity, of, the, situation, few, offenders, were, prosecuted, mainly, some, poor, trappers, but, the, large, enterprises, were, not, affected, in, 1857, a, bill, was, brought, forth, to, the, ohio, state, legislature, seeking, protection, for, the, passenger, pigeon, yet, a, select, committee, of, the, senate, filed, a, report, stating, that, the, bird, did, not, need, protection, being, wonderfully, prolific, and, dismissing, the, suggestion, that, the, species, could, be, destroyed, public, protests, against, trap, shooting, erupted, in, the, 1870s, as, the, birds, were, badly, treated, before, and, after, such, contests, conservationists, were, ineffective, in, stopping, the, slaughter, a, bill, was, passed, in, the, michigan, legislature, making, it, illegal, to, net, pigeons, within, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, of, a, nesting, area, in, 1897, a, bill, was, introduced, in, the, michigan, legislature, asking, for, a, 10, year, closed, season, on, passenger, pigeons, similar, legal, measures, were, passed, and, then, disregarded, in, pennsylvania, the, gestures, proved, futile, and, by, the, mid, 1890s, the, passenger, pigeon, had, almost, completely, disappeared, and, was, probably, extinct, as, a, breeding, bird, in, the, wild, small, flocks, are, known, to, have, existed, at, this, point, since, large, numbers, of, birds, were, still, being, sold, at, markets, thereafter, only, small, groups, or, individual, birds, were, reported, many, of, which, were, shot, on, sight, the, last, recorded, nest, and, egg, in, the, wild, were, collected, in, 1895, near, minneapolis, the, last, wild, individual, in, louisiana, was, discovered, among, a, flock, of, mourning, doves, in, 1896, and, subsequently, shot, many, late, sightings, are, thought, to, be, false, or, due, to, confusion, with, mourning, doves, the, last, fully, authenticated, record, of, a, wild, passenger, pigeon, was, near, oakford, illinois, on, march, 12, 1901, when, a, male, bird, was, killed, stuffed, and, placed, in, millikin, university, in, decatur, illinois, where, it, remains, today, this, was, not, discovered, until, 2014, when, writer, joel, greenberg, found, out, the, date, of, the, bird, s, shooting, while, doing, research, for, his, book, a, feathered, river, across, the, sky, greenberg, also, pointed, out, a, record, of, a, male, shot, near, laurel, indiana, on, april, 3, 1902, that, was, stuffed, but, later, destroyed, for, many, years, the, last, confirmed, wild, passenger, pigeon, was, thought, to, have, been, shot, near, sargents, pike, county, ohio, on, march, 24, 1900, when, a, female, bird, was, killed, by, a, boy, named, press, clay, southworth, with, a, bb, gun, the, boy, did, not, recognize, the, bird, as, a, passenger, pigeon, but, his, parents, identified, it, and, sent, it, to, a, taxidermist, the, specimen, nicknamed, buttons, due, to, the, buttons, used, instead, of, glass, eyes, was, donated, to, the, ohio, historical, society, by, the, family, in, 1915, the, reliability, of, accounts, after, the, ohio, illinois, and, indiana, birds, are, in, question, ornithologist, alexander, wetmore, claimed, that, he, saw, a, pair, flying, near, independence, kansas, in, april, 1905, on, may, 18, 1907, u, s, president, theodore, roosevelt, claimed, to, have, seen, a, flock, of, about, a, dozen, two, or, three, times, on, the, wing, while, on, retreat, at, his, cabin, in, pine, knot, virginia, and, that, they, lit, on, a, dead, tree, in, such, a, characteristically, pigeon, like, attitude, this, sighting, was, corroborated, by, a, local, gentleman, whom, he, had, rambled, around, with, in, the, woods, a, good, deal, and, whom, he, found, to, be, a, singularly, close, observer, in, 1910, the, american, ornithologists, union, offered, a, reward, of, 3, 000, for, discovering, a, nest, equivalent, to, 83, 325, in, 2020, most, captive, passenger, pigeons, were, kept, for, exploitative, purposes, but, some, were, housed, in, zoos, and, aviaries, audubon, alone, claimed, to, have, brought, 350, birds, to, england, in, 1830, distributing, them, among, various, noblemen, and, the, species, is, also, known, to, have, been, kept, at, london, zoo, being, common, birds, these, attracted, little, interest, until, the, species, became, rare, in, the, 1890s, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, last, known, captive, passenger, pigeons, were, divided, in, three, groups, one, in, milwaukee, one, in, chicago, and, one, in, cincinnati, there, are, claims, of, a, few, further, individuals, having, been, kept, in, various, places, but, these, accounts, are, not, considered, reliable, today, the, milwaukee, group, was, kept, by, david, whittaker, who, began, his, collection, in, 1888, and, possessed, fifteen, birds, some, years, later, all, descended, from, a, single, pair, the, chicago, group, was, kept, by, charles, otis, whitman, whose, collection, began, with, passenger, pigeons, bought, from, whittaker, beginning, in, 1896, he, had, an, interest, in, studying, pigeons, and, kept, his, passenger, pigeons, with, other, pigeon, species, whitman, brought, his, pigeons, with, him, from, chicago, to, massachusetts, by, railcar, each, summer, by, 1897, whitman, had, bought, all, of, whittaker, s, birds, and, upon, reaching, a, maximum, of, 19, individuals, he, gave, seven, back, to, whittaker, in, 1898, around, this, time, a, series, of, photographs, were, taken, of, these, birds, 24, of, the, photos, survive, some, of, these, images, have, been, reproduced, in, various, media, copies, of, which, are, now, kept, at, the, wisconsin, historical, society, it, is, unclear, exactly, where, when, and, by, whom, these, photos, were, taken, but, some, appear, to, have, been, taken, in, chicago, in, 1896, others, in, massachusetts, in, 1898, the, latter, by, a, j, g, hubbard, by, 1902, whitman, owned, sixteen, birds, many, eggs, were, laid, by, his, pigeons, but, few, hatched, and, many, hatchlings, died, a, newspaper, inquiry, was, published, that, requested, fresh, blood, to, the, flock, which, had, now, ceased, breeding, by, 1907, he, was, down, to, two, female, passenger, pigeons, that, died, that, winter, and, was, left, with, two, infertile, male, hybrids, whose, subsequent, fate, is, unknown, by, this, time, only, four, all, males, of, the, birds, whitman, returned, to, whittaker, were, alive, and, these, died, between, november, 1908, and, february, 1909, the, cincinnati, zoo, one, of, the, oldest, zoos, in, the, united, states, kept, passenger, pigeons, from, its, beginning, in, 1875, the, zoo, kept, more, than, twenty, individuals, in, a, ten, by, twelve, foot, cage, passenger, pigeons, do, not, appear, to, have, been, kept, at, the, zoo, due, to, their, rarity, but, to, enable, guests, to, have, a, closer, look, at, a, native, species, recognizing, the, decline, of, the, wild, populations, whitman, and, the, cincinnati, zoo, consistently, strove, to, breed, the, surviving, birds, including, attempts, at, making, a, rock, dove, foster, passenger, pigeon, eggs, in, 1902, whitman, gave, a, female, passenger, pigeon, to, the, zoo, this, was, possibly, the, individual, later, known, as, martha, which, would, become, the, last, living, member, of, the, species, other, sources, argue, that, martha, was, hatched, at, the, cincinnati, zoo, lived, there, for, 25, years, and, was, the, descendant, of, three, pairs, of, passenger, pigeons, purchased, by, the, zoo, in, 1877, it, is, thought, this, individual, was, named, martha, because, her, last, cage, mate, was, named, george, thereby, honoring, george, washington, and, his, wife, martha, though, it, has, also, been, claimed, she, was, named, after, the, mother, of, a, zookeeper, s, friends, in, 1909, martha, and, her, two, male, companions, at, the, cincinnati, zoo, became, the, only, known, surviving, passenger, pigeons, one, of, these, males, died, around, april, that, year, followed, by, george, the, remaining, male, on, july, 10, 1910, it, is, unknown, whether, the, remains, of, george, were, preserved, martha, soon, became, a, celebrity, due, to, her, status, as, an, endling, and, offers, of, a, 1, 000, reward, for, finding, a, mate, for, her, brought, even, more, visitors, to, see, her, during, her, last, four, years, in, solitude, her, cage, was, 5, 4, by, 6, m, 18, by, 20, ft, martha, became, steadily, slower, and, more, immobile, visitors, would, throw, sand, at, her, to, make, her, move, and, her, cage, was, roped, off, in, response, martha, died, of, old, age, on, september, 1, 1914, and, was, found, lifeless, on, the, floor, of, her, cage, it, was, claimed, that, she, died, at, 1, p, m, but, other, sources, suggest, she, died, some, hours, later, depending, on, the, source, martha, was, between, 17, and, 29, years, old, at, the, time, of, her, death, although, 29, is, the, generally, accepted, figure, at, the, time, it, was, suggested, that, martha, might, have, died, from, an, apoplectic, stroke, as, she, had, suffered, one, a, few, weeks, before, dying, her, body, was, frozen, into, a, block, of, ice, and, sent, to, the, smithsonian, institution, in, washington, where, it, was, skinned, dissected, photographed, and, mounted, as, she, was, molting, when, she, died, she, proved, difficult, to, stuff, and, previously, shed, feathers, were, added, to, the, skin, martha, was, on, display, for, many, years, but, after, a, period, in, the, museum, vaults, she, was, put, back, on, display, at, the, smithsonian, s, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, 2015, a, memorial, statue, of, martha, stands, on, the, grounds, of, the, cincinnati, zoo, in, front, of, the, passenger, pigeon, memorial, hut, formerly, the, aviary, wherein, martha, lived, now, a, national, historic, landmark, incidentally, the, last, specimen, of, the, extinct, carolina, parakeet, named, incus, died, in, martha, s, cage, in, 1918, the, stuffed, remains, of, that, bird, are, exhibited, in, the, memorial, hut, the, main, reasons, for, the, extinction, of, the, passenger, pigeon, were, the, massive, scale, of, hunting, the, rapid, loss, of, habitat, and, the, extremely, social, lifestyle, of, the, bird, which, made, it, highly, vulnerable, to, the, former, factors, deforestation, was, driven, by, the, need, to, free, land, for, agriculture, and, expanding, towns, but, also, due, to, the, demand, for, lumber, and, fuel, about, 728, 000, km, 2, 180, million, acres, were, cleared, for, farming, between, 1850, and, 1910, though, there, are, still, large, woodland, areas, in, eastern, north, america, which, support, a, variety, of, wildlife, it, was, not, enough, to, support, the, vast, number, of, passenger, pigeons, needed, to, sustain, the, population, in, contrast, very, small, populations, of, nearly, extinct, birds, such, as, the, k, k, p, strigops, habroptilus, and, the, takah, porphyrio, hochstetteri, have, been, enough, to, keep, those, species, extant, to, the, present, the, combined, effects, of, intense, hunting, and, deforestation, has, been, referred, to, as, a, blitzkrieg, against, the, passenger, pigeon, and, it, has, been, labeled, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, senseless, human, induced, extinctions, in, history, as, the, flocks, dwindled, in, size, the, passenger, pigeon, population, decreased, below, the, threshold, necessary, to, propagate, the, species, an, example, of, the, allee, effect, the, 2014, genetic, study, that, found, natural, fluctuations, in, population, numbers, prior, to, human, arrival, also, concluded, that, the, species, routinely, recovered, from, lows, in, the, population, and, suggested, that, one, of, these, lows, may, have, coincided, with, the, intensified, hunting, by, humans, in, the, 1800s, a, combination, which, would, have, led, to, the, rapid, extinction, of, the, species, a, similar, scenario, may, also, explain, the, rapid, extinction, of, the, rocky, mountain, locust, melanoplus, spretus, during, the, same, period, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, after, the, population, was, thinned, out, it, would, be, harder, for, few, or, solitary, birds, to, locate, suitable, feeding, areas, in, addition, to, the, birds, killed, or, driven, away, by, hunting, during, breeding, seasons, many, nestlings, were, also, orphaned, before, being, able, to, fend, for, themselves, other, less, convincing, contributing, factors, have, been, suggested, at, times, including, mass, drownings, newcastle, disease, and, migrations, to, areas, outside, their, original, range, the, extinction, of, the, passenger, pigeon, aroused, public, interest, in, the, conservation, movement, and, resulted, in, new, laws, and, practices, which, prevented, many, other, species, from, becoming, extinct, the, rapid, decline, of, the, passenger, pigeon, has, influenced, later, assessment, methods, of, the, extinction, risk, of, endangered, animal, populations, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, has, used, the, passenger, pigeon, as, an, example, in, cases, where, a, species, was, declared, at, risk, for, extinction, even, though, population, numbers, are, high, naturalist, aldo, leopold, paid, tribute, to, the, vanished, species, in, a, monument, dedication, held, by, the, wisconsin, society, for, ornithology, at, wyalusing, state, park, wisconsin, which, had, been, one, of, the, species, social, roost, sites, speaking, on, may, 11, 1947, leopold, remarked, men, still, live, who, in, their, youth, remember, pigeons, trees, still, live, who, in, their, youth, were, shaken, by, a, living, wind, but, a, decade, hence, only, the, oldest, oaks, will, remember, and, at, long, last, only, the, hills, will, know, today, at, least, 1, 532, passenger, pigeon, skins, along, with, 16, skeletons, are, in, existence, spread, across, many, institutions, all, over, the, world, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, passenger, pigeon, should, be, revived, when, available, technology, allows, it, a, concept, which, has, been, termed, de, extinction, using, genetic, material, from, such, specimens, in, 2003, the, pyrenean, ibex, capra, pyrenaica, pyrenaica, a, subspecies, of, the, spanish, ibex, was, the, first, extinct, animal, to, be, cloned, back, to, life, the, clone, lived, for, only, seven, minutes, before, dying, of, lung, defects, a, hindrance, to, cloning, the, passenger, pigeon, is, the, fact, that, the, dna, of, museum, specimens, has, been, contaminated, and, fragmented, due, to, exposure, to, heat, and, oxygen, american, geneticist, george, m, church, has, proposed, that, the, passenger, pigeon, genome, can, be, reconstructed, by, piecing, together, dna, fragments, from, different, specimens, the, next, step, would, be, to, splice, these, genes, into, the, stem, cells, of, rock, pigeons, or, band, tailed, pigeons, which, would, then, be, transformed, into, egg, and, sperm, cells, and, placed, into, the, eggs, of, rock, pigeons, resulting, in, rock, pigeons, bearing, passenger, pigeon, sperm, and, eggs, the, offspring, of, these, would, have, passenger, pigeon, traits, and, would, be, further, bred, to, favor, unique, features, of, the, extinct, species, the, idea, is, currently, being, pursued, by, the, american, non, profit, organization, revive, restore, the, general, idea, of, re, creating, extinct, species, has, been, criticized, since, the, large, funds, needed, could, be, spent, on, conserving, currently, threatened, species, and, habitats, and, because, conservation, efforts, might, be, viewed, as, less, urgent, in, the, case, of, the, passenger, pigeon, since, it, was, very, social, it, is, unlikely, that, enough, birds, could, be, created, for, revival, to, be, successful, and, it, is, unclear, whether, there, is, enough, appropriate, habitat, left, for, its, reintroduction, furthermore, the, parent, pigeons, that, would, raise, the, cloned, passenger, pigeons, would, belong, to, a, different, species, with, a, different, way, of, rearing, young
