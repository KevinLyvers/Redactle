the, tongue, is, a, muscular, organ, in, the, mouth, of, a, typical, tetrapod, it, manipulates, food, for, chewing, and, swallowing, as, part, of, the, digestive, process, and, is, the, primary, organ, of, taste, the, tongue, s, upper, surface, dorsum, is, covered, by, taste, buds, housed, in, numerous, lingual, papillae, it, is, sensitive, and, kept, moist, by, saliva, and, is, richly, supplied, with, nerves, and, blood, vessels, the, tongue, also, serves, as, a, natural, means, of, cleaning, the, teeth, a, major, function, of, the, tongue, is, the, enabling, of, speech, in, humans, and, vocalization, in, other, animals, the, human, tongue, is, divided, into, two, parts, an, oral, part, at, the, front, and, a, pharyngeal, part, at, the, back, the, left, and, right, sides, are, also, separated, along, most, of, its, length, by, a, vertical, section, of, fibrous, tissue, the, lingual, septum, that, results, in, a, groove, the, median, sulcus, on, the, tongue, s, surface, there, are, two, groups, of, glossal, muscles, the, four, intrinsic, muscles, alter, the, shape, of, the, tongue, and, are, not, attached, to, bone, the, four, paired, extrinsic, muscles, change, the, position, of, the, tongue, and, are, anchored, to, bone, the, word, tongue, derives, from, the, old, english, tunge, which, comes, from, proto, germanic, tung, n, it, has, cognates, in, other, germanic, languages, for, example, tonge, in, west, frisian, tong, in, dutch, and, afrikaans, zunge, in, german, tunge, in, danish, and, norwegian, and, tunga, in, icelandic, faroese, and, swedish, the, ue, ending, of, the, word, seems, to, be, a, fourteenth, century, attempt, to, show, proper, pronunciation, but, it, is, neither, etymological, nor, phonetic, some, used, the, spelling, tunge, and, tonge, as, late, as, the, sixteenth, century, the, tongue, is, a, muscular, hydrostat, that, forms, part, of, the, floor, of, the, oral, cavity, the, left, and, right, sides, of, the, tongue, are, separated, by, a, vertical, section, of, fibrous, tissue, known, as, the, lingual, septum, this, division, is, along, the, length, of, the, tongue, save, for, the, very, back, of, the, pharyngeal, part, and, is, visible, as, a, groove, called, the, median, sulcus, the, human, tongue, is, divided, into, anterior, and, posterior, parts, by, the, terminal, sulcus, which, is, a, v, shaped, groove, the, apex, of, the, terminal, sulcus, is, marked, by, a, blind, foramen, the, foramen, cecum, which, is, a, remnant, of, the, median, thyroid, diverticulum, in, early, embryonic, development, the, anterior, oral, part, is, the, visible, part, situated, at, the, front, and, makes, up, roughly, two, thirds, the, length, of, the, tongue, the, posterior, pharyngeal, part, is, the, part, closest, to, the, throat, roughly, one, third, of, its, length, these, parts, differ, in, terms, of, their, embryological, development, and, nerve, supply, the, anterior, tongue, is, at, its, apex, thin, and, narrow, it, is, directed, forward, against, the, lingual, surfaces, of, the, lower, incisor, teeth, the, posterior, part, is, at, its, root, directed, backward, and, connected, with, the, hyoid, bone, by, the, hyoglossi, and, genioglossi, muscles, and, the, hyoglossal, membrane, with, the, epiglottis, by, three, glossoepiglottic, folds, of, mucous, membrane, with, the, soft, palate, by, the, glossopalatine, arches, and, with, the, pharynx, by, the, superior, pharyngeal, constrictor, muscle, and, the, mucous, membrane, it, also, forms, the, anterior, wall, of, the, oropharynx, the, average, length, of, the, human, tongue, from, the, oropharynx, to, the, tip, is, 10, cm, the, average, weight, of, the, human, tongue, from, adult, males, is, 99g, and, for, adult, females, 79g, in, phonetics, and, phonology, a, distinction, is, made, between, the, tip, of, the, tongue, and, the, blade, the, portion, just, behind, the, tip, sounds, made, with, the, tongue, tip, are, said, to, be, apical, while, those, made, with, the, tongue, blade, are, said, to, be, laminal, the, upper, surface, of, the, tongue, is, called, the, dorsum, and, is, divided, by, a, groove, into, symmetrical, halves, by, the, median, sulcus, the, foramen, cecum, marks, the, end, of, this, division, at, about, 2, 5, cm, from, the, root, of, the, tongue, and, the, beginning, of, the, terminal, sulcus, the, foramen, cecum, is, also, the, point, of, attachment, of, the, thyroglossal, duct, and, is, formed, during, the, descent, of, the, thyroid, diverticulum, in, embryonic, development, the, terminal, sulcus, is, a, shallow, groove, that, runs, forward, as, a, shallow, groove, in, a, v, shape, from, the, foramen, cecum, forwards, and, outwards, to, the, margins, borders, of, the, tongue, the, terminal, sulcus, divides, the, tongue, into, a, posterior, pharyngeal, part, and, an, anterior, oral, part, the, pharyngeal, part, is, supplied, by, the, glossopharyngeal, nerve, and, the, oral, part, is, supplied, by, the, lingual, nerve, a, branch, of, the, mandibular, branch, v3, of, the, trigeminal, nerve, for, somatosensory, perception, and, by, the, chorda, tympani, a, branch, of, the, facial, nerve, for, taste, perception, both, parts, of, the, tongue, develop, from, different, pharyngeal, arches, on, the, undersurface, of, the, tongue, is, a, fold, of, mucous, membrane, called, the, frenulum, that, tethers, the, tongue, at, the, midline, to, the, floor, of, the, mouth, on, either, side, of, the, frenulum, are, small, prominences, called, sublingual, caruncles, that, the, major, salivary, submandibular, glands, drain, into, the, eight, muscles, of, the, human, tongue, are, classified, as, either, intrinsic, or, extrinsic, the, four, intrinsic, muscles, act, to, change, the, shape, of, the, tongue, and, are, not, attached, to, any, bone, the, four, extrinsic, muscles, act, to, change, the, position, of, the, tongue, and, are, anchored, to, bone, the, four, extrinsic, muscles, originate, from, bone, and, extend, to, the, tongue, they, are, the, genioglossus, the, hyoglossus, often, including, the, chondroglossus, the, styloglossus, and, the, palatoglossus, their, main, functions, are, altering, the, tongue, s, position, allowing, for, protrusion, retraction, and, side, to, side, movement, the, genioglossus, arises, from, the, mandible, and, protrudes, the, tongue, it, is, also, known, as, the, tongue, s, safety, muscle, since, it, is, the, only, muscle, that, propels, the, tongue, forward, the, hyoglossus, arises, from, the, hyoid, bone, and, retracts, and, depresses, the, tongue, the, chondroglossus, is, often, included, with, this, muscle, the, styloglossus, arises, from, the, styloid, process, of, the, temporal, bone, and, draws, the, sides, of, the, tongue, up, to, create, a, trough, for, swallowing, the, palatoglossus, arises, from, the, palatine, aponeurosis, and, depresses, the, soft, palate, moves, the, palatoglossal, fold, towards, the, midline, and, elevates, the, back, of, the, tongue, during, swallowing, four, paired, intrinsic, muscles, of, the, tongue, originate, and, insert, within, the, tongue, running, along, its, length, they, are, the, superior, longitudinal, muscle, the, inferior, longitudinal, muscle, the, vertical, muscle, and, the, transverse, muscle, these, muscles, alter, the, shape, of, the, tongue, by, lengthening, and, shortening, it, curling, and, uncurling, its, apex, and, edges, as, in, tongue, rolling, and, flattening, and, rounding, its, surface, this, provides, shape, and, helps, facilitate, speech, swallowing, and, eating, the, superior, longitudinal, muscle, runs, along, the, upper, surface, of, the, tongue, under, the, mucous, membrane, and, functions, to, shorten, and, curl, the, tongue, upward, it, originates, near, the, epiglottis, at, the, hyoid, bone, from, the, median, fibrous, septum, the, inferior, longitudinal, muscle, lines, the, sides, of, the, tongue, and, is, joined, to, the, styloglossus, muscle, it, functions, to, shorten, and, curl, the, tongue, downward, the, vertical, muscle, is, located, in, the, middle, of, the, tongue, and, joins, the, superior, and, inferior, longitudinal, muscles, it, functions, to, flatten, the, tongue, the, transverse, muscle, divides, the, tongue, at, the, middle, and, is, attached, to, the, mucous, membranes, that, run, along, the, sides, it, functions, to, lengthen, and, narrow, the, tongue, the, tongue, receives, its, blood, supply, primarily, from, the, lingual, artery, a, branch, of, the, external, carotid, artery, the, lingual, veins, drain, into, the, internal, jugular, vein, the, floor, of, the, mouth, also, receives, its, blood, supply, from, the, lingual, artery, there, is, also, a, secondary, blood, supply, to, the, root, of, tongue, from, the, tonsillar, branch, of, the, facial, artery, and, the, ascending, pharyngeal, artery, an, area, in, the, neck, sometimes, called, the, pirogov, triangle, is, formed, by, the, intermediate, tendon, of, the, digastric, muscle, the, posterior, border, of, the, mylohyoid, muscle, and, the, hypoglossal, nerve, the, lingual, artery, is, a, good, place, to, stop, severe, hemorrhage, from, the, tongue, innervation, of, the, tongue, consists, of, motor, fibers, special, sensory, fibers, for, taste, and, general, sensory, fibers, for, sensation, innervation, of, taste, and, sensation, is, different, for, the, anterior, and, posterior, part, of, the, tongue, because, they, are, derived, from, different, embryological, structures, pharyngeal, arch, 1, and, pharyngeal, arches, 3, and, 4, respectively, the, tip, of, tongue, drains, to, the, submental, nodes, the, left, and, right, halves, of, the, anterior, two, thirds, of, the, tongue, drains, to, submandibular, lymph, nodes, while, the, posterior, one, third, of, the, tongue, drains, to, the, jugulo, omohyoid, nodes, the, upper, surface, of, the, tongue, is, covered, in, masticatory, mucosa, a, type, of, oral, mucosa, which, is, of, keratinized, stratified, squamous, epithelium, embedded, in, this, are, numerous, papillae, some, of, which, house, the, taste, buds, and, their, taste, receptors, the, lingual, papillae, consist, of, filiform, fungiform, vallate, and, foliate, papillae, and, only, the, filiform, papillae, are, not, associated, with, any, taste, buds, the, tongue, can, divide, itself, in, dorsal, and, ventral, surface, the, dorsal, surface, is, a, stratified, squamous, keratinized, epithelium, which, is, characterized, by, numerous, mucosal, projections, called, papillae, the, lingual, papillae, covers, the, dorsal, side, of, the, tongue, towards, the, front, of, the, terminal, groove, the, ventral, surface, is, stratified, squamous, non, keratinized, epithelium, which, is, smooth, the, tongue, begins, to, develop, in, the, fourth, week, of, embryonic, development, from, a, median, swelling, the, median, tongue, bud, tuberculum, impar, of, the, first, pharyngeal, arch, in, the, fifth, week, a, pair, of, lateral, lingual, swellings, one, on, the, right, side, and, one, on, the, left, form, on, the, first, pharyngeal, arch, these, lingual, swellings, quickly, expand, and, cover, the, median, tongue, bud, they, form, the, anterior, part, of, the, tongue, that, makes, up, two, thirds, of, the, length, of, the, tongue, and, continue, to, develop, through, prenatal, development, the, line, of, their, fusion, is, marked, by, the, median, sulcus, in, the, fourth, week, a, swelling, appears, from, the, second, pharyngeal, arch, in, the, midline, called, the, copula, during, the, fifth, and, sixth, weeks, the, copula, is, overgrown, by, a, swelling, from, the, third, and, fourth, arches, mainly, from, the, third, arch, called, the, hypopharyngeal, eminence, and, this, develops, into, the, posterior, part, of, the, tongue, the, other, third, and, the, posterior, most, part, of, the, tongue, is, developed, from, the, fourth, pharyngeal, arch, the, hypopharyngeal, eminence, develops, mainly, by, the, growth, of, endoderm, from, the, third, pharyngeal, arch, the, boundary, between, the, two, parts, of, the, tongue, the, anterior, from, the, first, arch, and, the, posterior, from, the, third, arch, is, marked, by, the, terminal, sulcus, the, terminal, sulcus, is, shaped, like, a, v, with, the, tip, of, the, v, situated, posteriorly, at, the, tip, of, the, terminal, sulcus, is, the, foramen, cecum, which, is, the, point, of, attachment, of, the, thyroglossal, duct, where, the, embryonic, thyroid, begins, to, descend, chemicals, that, stimulate, taste, receptor, cells, are, known, as, tastants, once, a, tastant, is, dissolved, in, saliva, it, can, make, contact, with, the, plasma, membrane, of, the, gustatory, hairs, which, are, the, sites, of, taste, transduction, the, tongue, is, equipped, with, many, taste, buds, on, its, dorsal, surface, and, each, taste, bud, is, equipped, with, taste, receptor, cells, that, can, sense, particular, classes, of, tastes, distinct, types, of, taste, receptor, cells, respectively, detect, substances, that, are, sweet, bitter, salty, sour, spicy, or, taste, of, umami, umami, receptor, cells, are, the, least, understood, and, accordingly, are, the, type, most, intensively, under, research, there, is, a, common, misconception, that, different, sections, of, the, tongue, are, exclusively, responsible, for, different, basic, tastes, although, widely, taught, in, schools, in, the, form, of, the, tongue, map, this, is, incorrect, all, taste, sensations, come, from, all, regions, of, the, tongue, although, certain, parts, are, more, sensitive, to, certain, tastes, the, tongue, is, an, important, accessory, organ, in, the, digestive, system, the, tongue, is, used, for, crushing, food, against, the, hard, palate, during, mastication, and, manipulation, of, food, for, softening, prior, to, swallowing, the, epithelium, on, the, tongue, s, upper, or, dorsal, surface, is, keratinised, consequently, the, tongue, can, grind, against, the, hard, palate, without, being, itself, damaged, or, irritated, the, tongue, is, one, of, the, primary, articulators, in, the, production, of, speech, and, this, is, facilitated, by, both, the, extrinsic, muscles, that, move, the, tongue, and, the, intrinsic, muscles, that, change, its, shape, specifically, different, vowels, are, articulated, by, changing, the, tongue, s, height, and, retraction, to, alter, the, resonant, properties, of, the, vocal, tract, these, resonant, properties, amplify, specific, harmonic, frequencies, formants, that, are, different, for, each, vowel, while, attenuating, other, harmonics, for, example, is, produced, with, the, tongue, lowered, and, centered, and, is, produced, with, the, tongue, raised, and, fronted, consonants, are, articulated, by, constricting, airflow, through, the, vocal, tract, and, many, consonants, feature, a, constriction, between, the, tongue, and, some, other, part, of, the, vocal, tract, for, example, alveolar, consonants, like, and, are, articulated, with, the, tongue, against, the, alveolar, ridge, while, velar, consonants, like, and, are, articulated, with, the, tongue, dorsum, against, the, soft, palate, velum, tongue, shape, is, also, relevant, to, speech, articulation, for, example, in, retroflex, consonants, where, the, tip, of, the, tongue, is, curved, backward, the, tongue, plays, a, role, in, physical, intimacy, and, sexuality, the, tongue, is, part, of, the, erogenous, zone, of, the, mouth, and, can, be, used, in, intimate, contact, as, in, the, french, kiss, and, in, oral, sex, a, congenital, disorder, of, the, tongue, is, that, of, ankyloglossia, also, known, as, tongue, tie, the, tongue, is, tied, to, the, floor, of, the, mouth, by, a, very, short, and, thickened, frenulum, and, this, affects, speech, eating, and, swallowing, the, tongue, is, prone, to, several, pathologies, including, glossitis, and, other, inflammations, such, as, geographic, tongue, and, median, rhomboid, glossitis, burning, mouth, syndrome, oral, hairy, leukoplakia, oral, candidiasis, thrush, black, hairy, tongue, bifid, tongue, due, to, failure, in, fusion, of, two, lingual, swellings, of, first, pharyngeal, arch, and, fissured, tongue, there, are, several, types, of, oral, cancer, that, mainly, affect, the, tongue, mostly, these, are, squamous, cell, carcinomas, food, debris, desquamated, epithelial, cells, and, bacteria, often, form, a, visible, tongue, coating, this, coating, has, been, identified, as, a, major, factor, contributing, to, bad, breath, halitosis, which, can, be, managed, by, using, a, tongue, cleaner, the, sublingual, region, underneath, the, front, of, the, tongue, is, an, ideal, location, for, the, administration, of, certain, medications, into, the, body, the, oral, mucosa, is, very, thin, underneath, the, tongue, and, is, underlain, by, a, plexus, of, veins, the, sublingual, route, takes, advantage, of, the, highly, vascular, quality, of, the, oral, cavity, and, allows, for, the, speedy, application, of, medication, into, the, cardiovascular, system, bypassing, the, gastrointestinal, tract, this, is, the, only, convenient, and, efficacious, route, of, administration, apart, from, intravenous, therapy, of, nitroglycerin, to, a, patient, suffering, chest, pain, from, angina, pectoris, the, muscles, of, the, tongue, evolved, in, amphibians, from, occipital, somites, most, amphibians, show, a, proper, tongue, after, their, metamorphosis, as, a, consequence, most, tetrapod, animals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, have, tongues, the, frog, family, of, pipids, lack, tongue, in, mammals, such, as, dogs, and, cats, the, tongue, is, often, used, to, clean, the, fur, and, body, by, licking, the, tongues, of, these, species, have, a, very, rough, texture, which, allows, them, to, remove, oils, and, parasites, some, dogs, have, a, tendency, to, consistently, lick, a, part, of, their, foreleg, which, can, result, in, a, skin, condition, known, as, a, lick, granuloma, a, dog, s, tongue, also, acts, as, a, heat, regulator, as, a, dog, increases, its, exercise, the, tongue, will, increase, in, size, due, to, greater, blood, flow, the, tongue, hangs, out, of, the, dog, s, mouth, and, the, moisture, on, the, tongue, will, work, to, cool, the, bloodflow, some, animals, have, tongues, that, are, specially, adapted, for, catching, prey, for, example, chameleons, frogs, pangolins, and, anteaters, have, prehensile, tongues, other, animals, may, have, organs, that, are, analogous, to, tongues, such, as, a, butterfly, s, proboscis, or, a, radula, on, a, mollusc, but, these, are, not, homologous, with, the, tongues, found, in, vertebrates, and, often, have, little, resemblance, in, function, for, example, butterflies, do, not, lick, with, their, proboscides, they, suck, through, them, and, the, proboscis, is, not, a, single, organ, but, two, jaws, held, together, to, form, a, tube, many, species, of, fish, have, small, folds, at, the, base, of, their, mouths, that, might, informally, be, called, tongues, but, they, lack, a, muscular, structure, like, the, true, tongues, found, in, most, tetrapods, the, tongue, can, serve, as, a, metonym, for, language, for, example, the, new, testament, of, the, bible, in, the, book, of, acts, of, the, apostles, jesus, disciples, on, the, day, of, pentecost, received, a, type, of, spiritual, gift, there, appeared, unto, them, cloven, tongues, like, as, of, fire, and, it, sat, upon, each, of, them, and, they, were, all, filled, with, the, holy, ghost, and, began, to, speak, with, other, tongues, which, amazed, the, crowd, of, jewish, people, in, jerusalem, who, were, from, various, parts, of, the, roman, empire, but, could, now, understand, what, was, being, preached, the, phrase, mother, tongue, is, used, as, a, child, s, first, language, many, languages, have, the, same, word, for, tongue, and, language, as, did, the, english, language, before, the, middle, ages, a, common, temporary, failure, in, word, retrieval, from, memory, is, referred, to, as, the, tip, of, the, tongue, phenomenon, the, expression, tongue, in, cheek, refers, to, a, statement, that, is, not, to, be, taken, entirely, seriously, something, said, or, done, with, subtle, ironic, or, sarcastic, humour, a, tongue, twister, is, a, phrase, very, difficult, to, pronounce, aside, from, being, a, medical, condition, tongue, tied, means, being, unable, to, say, what, you, want, due, to, confusion, or, restriction, the, phrase, cat, got, your, tongue, refers, to, when, a, person, is, speechless, to, bite, one, s, tongue, is, a, phrase, which, describes, holding, back, an, opinion, to, avoid, causing, offence, a, slip, of, the, tongue, refers, to, an, unintentional, utterance, such, as, a, freudian, slip, the, gift, of, tongues, refers, to, when, one, is, uncommonly, gifted, to, be, able, to, speak, in, a, foreign, language, often, as, a, type, of, spiritual, gift, speaking, in, tongues, is, a, common, phrase, used, to, describe, glossolalia, which, is, to, make, smooth, language, resembling, sounds, that, is, no, true, spoken, language, itself, a, deceptive, person, is, said, to, have, a, forked, tongue, and, a, smooth, talking, person, is, said, to, have, a, silver, tongue, sticking, one, s, tongue, out, at, someone, is, considered, a, childish, gesture, of, rudeness, or, defiance, in, many, countries, the, act, may, also, have, sexual, connotations, depending, on, the, way, in, which, it, is, done, however, in, tibet, it, is, considered, a, greeting, in, 2009, a, farmer, from, fabriano, italy, was, convicted, and, fined, by, italy, s, highest, court, for, sticking, his, tongue, out, at, a, neighbor, with, whom, he, had, been, arguing, proof, of, the, affront, had, been, captured, with, a, cell, phone, camera, tongue, piercing, and, splitting, have, become, more, common, in, western, countries, in, recent, decades, one, study, found, that, one, fifth, of, young, adults, in, israel, had, at,
