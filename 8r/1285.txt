dental, restoration, dental, fillings, or, simply, fillings, are, treatments, used, to, restore, the, function, integrity, and, morphology, of, missing, tooth, structure, resulting, from, caries, or, external, trauma, as, well, as, to, the, replacement, of, such, structure, supported, by, dental, implants, they, are, of, two, broad, types, direct, and, indirect, and, are, further, classified, by, location, and, size, a, root, canal, filling, for, example, is, a, restorative, technique, used, to, fill, the, space, where, the, dental, pulp, normally, resides, restoring, a, tooth, to, good, form, and, function, requires, two, steps, the, process, of, preparation, usually, involves, cutting, the, tooth, with, a, rotary, dental, handpiece, and, dental, burrs, a, dental, laser, or, through, air, abrasion, or, in, the, case, of, atraumatic, restorative, treatment, hand, instruments, to, make, space, for, the, planned, restorative, materials, and, to, remove, any, dental, decay, or, portions, of, the, tooth, that, are, structurally, unsound, if, permanent, restoration, cannot, be, carried, out, immediately, after, tooth, preparation, temporary, restoration, may, be, performed, the, prepared, tooth, ready, for, placement, of, restorative, materials, is, generally, called, a, tooth, preparation, materials, used, may, be, gold, amalgam, dental, composites, glass, ionomer, cement, or, porcelain, among, others, preparations, may, be, intracoronal, or, extracoronal, intracoronal, preparations, are, those, which, serve, to, hold, restorative, material, within, the, confines, of, the, structure, of, the, crown, of, a, tooth, examples, include, all, classes, of, cavity, preparations, for, composite, or, amalgam, as, well, as, those, for, gold, and, porcelain, inlays, intracoronal, preparations, are, also, made, as, female, recipients, to, receive, the, male, components, of, removable, partial, dentures, extracoronal, preparations, provide, a, core, or, base, upon, which, restorative, material, will, be, placed, to, bring, the, tooth, back, into, a, functional, and, aesthetic, structure, examples, include, crowns, and, onlays, as, well, as, veneers, in, preparing, a, tooth, for, a, restoration, a, number, of, considerations, will, determine, the, type, and, extent, of, the, preparation, the, most, important, factor, to, consider, is, decay, for, the, most, part, the, extent, of, the, decay, will, define, the, extent, of, the, preparation, and, in, turn, the, subsequent, method, and, appropriate, materials, for, restoration, another, consideration, is, unsupported, tooth, structure, when, preparing, the, tooth, to, receive, a, restoration, unsupported, enamel, is, removed, to, allow, for, a, more, predictable, restoration, while, enamel, is, the, hardest, substance, in, the, human, body, it, is, particularly, brittle, and, unsupported, enamel, fractures, easily, a, systematic, review, concluded, that, for, decayed, baby, primary, teeth, putting, an, off, the, shelf, metal, crown, over, the, tooth, hall, technique, or, only, partially, removing, decay, also, referred, to, as, selective, removal, before, placing, a, filling, may, be, better, than, the, conventional, treatment, of, removing, all, decay, before, filling, for, decayed, adult, permanent, teeth, partial, removal, also, referred, to, as, selective, removal, of, decay, before, filling, the, tooth, or, adding, a, second, stage, to, this, treatment, where, more, decay, is, removed, after, several, months, may, be, better, than, conventional, treatment, this, technique, involves, placing, a, soft, or, malleable, filling, into, the, prepared, tooth, and, building, up, the, tooth, the, material, is, then, set, hard, and, the, tooth, is, restored, where, a, wall, of, the, tooth, is, missing, and, needs, to, be, rebuilt, a, matrix, should, be, used, before, placing, the, material, to, recreate, the, shape, of, the, tooth, so, it, is, cleansable, and, to, prevent, the, teeth, from, sticking, together, sectional, matrices, are, generally, preferred, to, circumferential, matrices, when, placing, composite, restorations, in, that, they, favour, the, formation, of, a, contact, point, this, is, important, to, reduce, patient, complaints, of, food, impaction, between, the, teeth, however, sectional, matrices, can, be, more, technique, sensitive, to, use, so, care, and, skill, is, required, to, prevent, problems, occurring, in, the, final, restoration, the, advantage, of, direct, restorations, is, that, they, are, usually, set, quickly, and, can, be, placed, in, a, single, procedure, the, dentist, has, a, variety, of, different, filling, options, to, choose, from, a, decision, is, usually, made, based, on, the, location, and, severity, of, the, associated, cavity, since, the, material, is, required, to, set, while, in, contact, with, the, tooth, limited, energy, heat, is, passed, to, the, tooth, from, the, setting, process, in, this, technique, the, restoration, is, fabricated, outside, of, the, mouth, using, the, dental, impressions, of, the, prepared, tooth, common, indirect, restorations, include, inlays, and, onlays, crowns, bridges, and, veneers, usually, a, dental, technician, fabricates, the, indirect, restoration, from, records, the, dentist, has, provided, the, finished, restoration, is, usually, bonded, permanently, with, a, dental, cement, it, is, often, done, in, two, separate, visits, to, the, dentist, common, indirect, restorations, are, done, using, gold, or, ceramics, while, the, indirect, restoration, is, being, prepared, a, provisory, temporary, restoration, is, sometimes, used, to, cover, the, prepared, tooth, to, help, maintain, the, surrounding, dental, tissues, removable, dental, prostheses, mainly, dentures, are, sometimes, considered, a, form, of, indirect, dental, restoration, as, they, are, made, to, replace, missing, teeth, there, are, numerous, types, of, precision, attachments, also, known, as, combined, restorations, to, aid, removable, prosthetic, attachment, to, teeth, including, magnets, clips, hooks, and, implants, which, may, themselves, be, seen, as, a, form, of, dental, restoration, the, cerec, method, is, a, chairside, cad, cam, restorative, procedure, an, optical, impression, of, the, prepared, tooth, is, taken, using, a, camera, next, the, specific, software, takes, the, digital, picture, and, converts, it, into, a, 3d, virtual, model, on, the, computer, screen, a, ceramic, block, that, matches, the, tooth, shade, is, placed, in, the, milling, machine, an, all, ceramic, tooth, colored, restoration, is, finished, and, ready, to, bond, in, place, another, fabrication, method, is, to, import, stl, and, native, dental, cad, files, into, cad, cam, software, products, that, guide, the, user, through, the, manufacturing, process, the, software, can, select, the, tools, machining, sequences, and, cutting, conditions, optimized, for, particular, types, of, materials, such, as, titanium, and, zirconium, and, for, particular, prostheses, such, as, copings, and, bridges, in, some, cases, the, intricate, nature, of, some, implants, requires, the, use, of, 5, axis, machining, methods, to, reach, every, part, of, the, job, greene, vardiman, black, classification, g, v, black, classified, the, cavities, depending, on, their, site, graham, j, mount, s, classification, mount, classified, cavities, depending, on, their, site, and, size, the, proposed, classification, was, designed, to, simplify, the, identification, of, lesions, and, to, define, their, complexity, as, they, enlarge, site, size, the, following, casting, alloys, are, mostly, used, for, making, crowns, bridges, and, dentures, titanium, usually, commercially, pure, but, sometimes, a, 90, alloy, is, used, as, the, anchor, for, dental, implants, as, it, is, biocompatible, and, can, integrate, into, bone, amalgams, are, alloys, formed, by, a, reaction, between, two, or, more, metals, one, of, which, is, mercury, it, is, a, hard, restorative, material, and, is, silvery, grey, in, colour, one, of, the, oldest, direct, restorative, materials, still, in, use, dental, amalgam, was, widely, used, in, the, past, with, a, high, degree, of, success, although, recently, its, popularity, has, declined, due, to, a, number, of, reasons, including, the, development, of, alternative, bonded, restorative, materials, increase, in, demand, for, more, aesthetic, restorations, and, public, perceptions, concerning, the, potential, health, risks, of, the, material, the, composition, of, dental, amalgam, is, controlled, by, the, iso, standard, for, dental, amalgam, alloy, iso, 1559, the, major, components, of, amalgam, are, silver, tin, and, copper, other, metals, and, small, amounts, of, minor, elements, such, as, zinc, mercury, palladium, platinum, and, indium, are, also, present, earlier, versions, of, dental, amalgams, known, as, conventional, amalgams, consisted, of, at, least, 65, wt, silver, 29, wt, tin, and, less, than, 6, wt, copper, improvements, in, the, understanding, of, the, structure, of, amalgam, post, 1986, gave, rise, to, copper, enriched, amalgam, alloys, which, contain, between, 12, wt, and, 30, wt, copper, and, at, least, 40, wt, silver, the, higher, level, of, copper, improved, the, setting, reaction, of, amalgam, giving, greater, corrosion, resistance, and, early, strength, after, setting, possible, indications, for, amalgam, are, for, load, bearing, restorations, in, medium, to, large, sized, cavities, in, posterior, teeth, and, in, core, build, ups, when, a, definitive, restoration, will, be, an, indirect, cast, restoration, such, as, a, crown, or, bridge, retainer, contraindications, for, amalgam, are, if, aesthetics, are, paramount, to, patient, due, to, the, colour, of, the, material, amalgams, should, be, avoided, if, the, patient, has, a, history, of, sensitivity, to, mercury, or, other, amalgam, components, besides, that, amalgam, is, avoided, if, there, is, extensive, loss, of, tooth, substance, such, that, a, retentive, cavity, cannot, be, produced, or, if, excessive, removal, of, health, tooth, substance, would, be, required, to, produce, a, retentive, cavity, advantages, of, amalgam, include, durability, if, placed, under, ideal, conditions, there, is, evidence, of, good, long, term, clinical, performance, of, the, restorations, placement, time, of, amalgam, is, shorter, compared, to, that, of, composites, and, the, restoration, can, be, completed, in, a, single, appointment, the, material, is, also, more, technique, forgiving, compared, to, composite, restorations, used, for, that, purpose, dental, amalgam, is, also, radiopaque, which, is, beneficial, for, differentiating, the, material, between, tooth, tissues, on, radiographs, for, diagnosing, secondary, caries, the, cost, of, the, restoration, is, typically, cheaper, than, composite, restorations, disadvantages, of, amalgam, include, poor, aesthetic, qualities, due, to, its, colour, amalgam, does, not, bond, to, tooth, easily, hence, it, relies, on, mechanical, forms, of, retention, examples, of, this, are, undercuts, slots, grooves, or, root, canal, posts, in, some, cases, this, may, necessitate, excessive, amounts, of, healthy, tooth, structure, to, be, removed, hence, alternative, resin, based, or, glass, ionomer, cement, based, materials, are, used, instead, for, smaller, restorations, including, pit, and, small, fissure, caries, there, is, also, a, risk, of, marginal, breakdown, in, the, restorations, this, could, be, due, to, corrosion, which, may, result, in, creep, and, ditching, of, the, restoration, creep, can, be, defined, as, the, slow, internal, stressing, and, deformation, of, amalgam, under, stress, this, effect, is, reduced, by, incorporating, copper, into, amalgam, alloys, some, patients, may, experience, local, sensitivity, reactions, to, amalgam, although, the, mercury, in, cured, amalgam, is, not, available, as, free, mercury, concern, of, its, toxicity, has, existed, since, the, invention, of, amalgam, as, a, dental, material, it, is, banned, or, restricted, in, norway, sweden, and, finland, see, dental, amalgam, controversy, direct, gold, fillings, were, practiced, during, the, times, of, the, civil, war, in, america, although, rarely, used, today, due, to, expense, and, specialized, training, requirements, gold, foil, can, be, used, for, direct, dental, restorations, dental, composites, commonly, described, to, patients, as, tooth, colored, fillings, are, a, group, of, restorative, materials, used, in, dentistry, they, can, be, used, in, direct, restorations, to, fill, in, the, cavities, created, by, dental, caries, and, trauma, minor, buildup, for, restoring, tooth, wear, non, carious, tooth, surface, loss, and, filling, in, small, gaps, between, teeth, labial, veneer, dental, composites, are, also, used, as, indirect, restoration, to, make, crowns, and, inlays, in, the, laboratory, these, materials, are, similar, to, those, used, in, direct, fillings, and, are, tooth, colored, their, strength, and, durability, is, not, as, high, as, porcelain, or, metal, restorations, and, they, are, more, prone, to, wear, and, discolouration, as, with, other, composite, materials, a, dental, composite, typically, consists, of, a, resin, based, matrix, which, contains, a, modified, methacrylate, or, acrylate, two, examples, of, such, commonly, used, monomers, include, bisphenol, a, glycidyl, methacrylate, bisma, and, urethane, dimethacrylate, udma, together, with, tri, ethylene, glycol, dimethacrylate, tegma, tegma, is, a, comonomer, which, can, be, used, to, control, viscosity, as, bis, gma, is, a, large, molecule, with, high, viscosity, for, easier, clinical, handling, inorganic, filler, such, as, silica, quartz, or, various, glasses, are, added, to, reduce, polymerization, shrinkage, by, occupying, volume, and, to, confirm, radio, opacity, of, products, due, to, translucency, in, property, which, can, be, helpful, in, diagnosis, of, dental, caries, around, dental, restorations, the, filler, particles, give, the, composites, wear, resistance, as, well, compositions, vary, widely, with, proprietary, mixes, of, resins, forming, the, matrix, as, well, as, engineered, filler, glasses, and, glass, ceramics, a, coupling, agent, such, as, silane, is, used, to, enhance, the, bond, between, resin, matrix, and, filler, particles, an, initiator, package, begins, the, polymerization, reaction, of, the, resins, when, external, energy, light, heat, etc, is, applied, for, example, camphorquinone, can, be, excited, by, visible, blue, light, with, critical, wavelength, of, 460, 480, nm, to, yield, necessary, free, radicals, to, start, the, process, after, tooth, preparation, a, thin, primer, or, bonding, agent, is, used, modern, photo, polymerised, composites, are, applied, and, cured, in, relatively, thin, layers, as, determined, by, their, opacity, after, some, curing, the, final, surface, will, be, shaped, and, polished, a, glass, ionomer, cement, gic, is, a, class, of, materials, commonly, used, in, dentistry, as, direct, filling, materials, and, or, for, luting, indirect, restorations, gic, can, also, be, placed, as, a, lining, material, in, some, restorations, for, extra, protection, these, tooth, coloured, materials, were, introduced, in, 1972, for, use, as, restorative, materials, for, anterior, teeth, particularly, for, eroded, areas, the, material, consists, of, two, main, components, liquid, and, powder, the, liquid, is, the, acidic, component, containing, of, polyacrylic, acid, and, tartaric, acid, added, to, control, the, setting, characteristics, the, powder, is, the, basic, component, consisting, of, sodium, alumino, silicate, glass, the, desirable, properties, of, glass, ionomer, cements, make, them, useful, materials, in, the, restoration, of, carious, lesions, in, low, stress, areas, such, as, smooth, surface, and, small, anterior, proximal, cavities, in, primary, teeth, advantages, of, using, glass, ionomer, cement, disadvantages, of, using, glass, ionomer, cement, resin, modified, glass, ionomer, resin, modified, glass, ionomer, was, developed, to, combine, the, properties, of, glass, ionomer, cement, with, composite, technology, it, comes, in, a, powder, liquid, form, the, powder, contains, fluro, alumino, silicate, glass, barium, glass, provides, radiopacity, potassium, persulphate, a, redox, catalyst, to, provide, resin, cure, in, the, dark, and, other, components, such, as, pigments, the, liquid, consists, of, hema, water, miscible, resin, polyacrylic, acid, with, pendant, methacrylate, groups, and, tartaric, acid, this, can, undergo, both, acid, base, and, polymerisation, reactions, it, also, has, photoinitiators, present, which, enable, light, curing, the, ionomer, has, a, number, of, uses, in, dentistry, it, can, be, applied, as, fissure, sealant, placed, in, endodontic, access, cavity, as, a, temporary, filling, and, a, luting, agent, it, can, also, be, used, to, restore, lesions, in, both, primary, and, permanent, dentition, they, are, easier, to, use, and, are, a, very, popular, group, of, materials, advantages, of, using, rmgic, disadvantages, of, using, rmgic, gic, and, rmgic, are, used, in, dentistry, there, will, be, times, when, one, of, these, materials, is, better, than, the, other, but, that, is, dependent, upon, the, clinical, situation, however, in, most, cases, the, ease, of, use, is, deciding, factor, dental, compomers, are, another, type, of, white, filling, material, although, their, use, is, not, as, widespread, compomers, were, formed, by, modifying, dental, composites, with, poly, acid, in, an, effort, to, combine, the, desirable, properties, of, dental, composites, namely, their, good, aesthetics, and, glass, ionomer, cements, namely, their, ability, to, release, fluoride, over, a, long, time, whilst, this, combination, of, good, aesthetics, and, fluoride, release, may, seem, to, give, compomers, a, selective, advantage, their, poor, mechanical, properties, detailed, below, limits, their, use, compomers, have, a, lower, wear, resistance, and, a, lower, compressive, flexural, and, tensile, strength, than, dental, composites, although, their, wear, resistance, is, greater, than, resin, modified, and, conventional, glass, ionomer, cements, compomers, cannot, adhere, directly, to, tooth, tissue, like, glass, ionomer, cements, they, require, a, bonding, agent, like, dental, composites, compomers, may, be, used, as, a, cavity, lining, material, and, a, restorative, material, for, non, load, bearing, cavities, in, paediatric, dentistry, they, can, also, be, used, as, a, fissure, sealant, material, the, luting, version, of, compomer, may, be, used, to, cement, cast, alloy, and, ceramic, metal, restorations, and, to, cement, orthodontic, bands, in, paediatric, patients, however, compomer, luting, cement, should, not, be, used, with, all, ceramic, crowns, full, porcelain, dental, materials, include, dental, porcelain, porcelain, meaning, a, high, firing, temperature, ceramic, other, ceramics, sintered, glass, materials, and, glass, ceramics, as, indirect, fillings, and, crowns, or, metal, free, jacket, crowns, they, are, also, used, as, inlays, onlays, and, aesthetic, veneers, a, veneer, is, a, very, thin, shell, of, porcelain, that, can, replace, or, cover, part, of, the, enamel, of, the, tooth, full, porcelain, restorations, are, particularly, desirable, because, their, color, and, translucency, mimic, natural, tooth, enamel, another, type, is, known, as, porcelain, fused, to, metal, which, is, used, to, provide, strength, to, a, crown, or, bridge, these, restorations, are, very, strong, durable, and, resistant, to, wear, because, the, combination, of, porcelain, and, metal, creates, a, stronger, restoration, than, porcelain, used, alone, one, of, the, advantages, of, computerized, dentistry, cad, cam, technologies, involves, the, use, of, machinable, ceramics, which, are, sold, in, a, partially, sintered, machinable, state, that, is, fired, again, after, machining, to, form, a, hard, ceramic, some, of, the, materials, used, are, glass, bonded, porcelain, vitablock, lithium, disilicate, glass, ceramic, a, ceramic, crystallizing, from, a, glass, by, special, heat, treatment, and, phase, stabilized, zirconia, zirconium, dioxide, zro, 2, previous, attempts, to, utilize, high, performance, ceramics, such, as, zirconium, oxide, were, thwarted, by, the, fact, that, this, material, could, not, be, processed, using, the, traditional, methods, used, in, dentistry, because, of, its, high, strength, and, comparatively, much, higher, fracture, toughness, sintered, zirconium, oxide, can, be, used, in, posterior, crowns, and, bridges, implant, abutments, and, root, dowel, pins, lithium, disilicate, used, in, the, latest, chairside, economical, restoration, of, esthetic, ceramics, cerec, product, also, has, the, fracture, resistance, needed, for, use, on, molars, some, all, ceramic, restorations, such, as, porcelain, fused, to, alumina, set, the, standard, for, high, aesthetics, in, dentistry, because, they, are, strong, and, their, color, and, translucency, mimic, natural, tooth, enamel, cast, metals, and, porcelain, on, metal, were, the, standard, material, for, crowns, and, bridges, for, long, time, the, full, ceramic, restorations, are, now, the, major, choice, of, patients, and, are, of, commonly, applied, by, dentists, the, us, national, institute, of, dental, research, and, international, organizations, as, well, as, commercial, suppliers, conduct, research, on, new, materials, in, 2010, researchers, reported, that, they, were, able, to, stimulate, mineralization, of, an, enamel, like, layer, of, fluorapatite, in, vivo, filling, material, that, is, compatible, with, pulp, tissue, has, been, developed, it, could, be, used, where, previously, a, root, canal, or, extraction, was, required, according, to, 2016, reports, dental, implants, are, anchors, placed, in, bone, usually, made, from, titanium, or, titanium, alloy, they, can, support, dental, restorations, which, replace, missing, teeth, some, restorative, applications, include, supporting, crowns, bridges, or, dental, prostheses, when, a, deep, cavity, had, been, filled, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, nerve, may, have, been, irritated, this, can, result, in, short, term, sensitivity, to, cold, and, hot, substances, and, pain, when, biting, down, on, the, specific, tooth, it, may, settle, down, on, its, own, if, not, then, alternative, treatment, such, as, root, canal, treatment, may, be, considered, to, resolve, the, pain, while, keeping, the, tooth, in, situations, where, a, relatively, larger, amount, of, tooth, structure, has, been, lost, or, replaced, with, a, filling, material, the, overall, strength, of, the, tooth, may, be, affected, this, significantly, increases, the, risk, of, the, tooth, fracturing, off, in, the, future, when, excess, force, is, placed, on, the, tooth, such, as, trauma, or, grinding, teeth, at, night, leading, to, cracked, tooth, syndrome
