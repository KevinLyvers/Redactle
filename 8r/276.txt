the, cell, membrane, also, known, as, the, plasma, membrane, or, cytoplasmic, membrane, and, historically, referred, to, as, the, plasmalemma, is, a, biological, membrane, that, separates, and, protects, the, interior, of, a, cell, from, the, outside, environment, the, extracellular, space, the, cell, membrane, consists, of, a, lipid, bilayer, made, up, of, two, layers, of, phospholipids, with, cholesterols, a, lipid, component, interspersed, between, them, maintaining, appropriate, membrane, fluidity, at, various, temperatures, the, membrane, also, contains, membrane, proteins, including, integral, proteins, that, span, the, membrane, and, serve, as, membrane, transporters, and, peripheral, proteins, that, loosely, attach, to, the, outer, peripheral, side, of, the, cell, membrane, acting, as, enzymes, to, facilitate, interaction, with, the, cell, s, environment, glycolipids, embedded, in, the, outer, lipid, layer, serve, a, similar, purpose, the, cell, membrane, controls, the, movement, of, substances, in, and, out, of, a, cell, being, selectively, permeable, to, ions, and, organic, molecules, in, addition, cell, membranes, are, involved, in, a, variety, of, cellular, processes, such, as, cell, adhesion, ion, conductivity, and, cell, signalling, and, serve, as, the, attachment, surface, for, several, extracellular, structures, including, the, cell, wall, and, the, carbohydrate, layer, called, the, glycocalyx, as, well, as, the, intracellular, network, of, protein, fibers, called, the, cytoskeleton, in, the, field, of, synthetic, biology, cell, membranes, can, be, artificially, reassembled, robert, hooke, s, discovery, of, cells, in, 1665, led, to, the, proposal, of, the, cell, theory, initially, it, was, believed, that, all, cells, contained, a, hard, cell, wall, since, only, plant, cells, could, be, observed, at, the, time, microscopists, focused, on, the, cell, wall, for, well, over, 150, years, until, advances, in, microscopy, were, made, in, the, early, 19th, century, cells, were, recognized, as, being, separate, entities, unconnected, and, bound, by, individual, cell, walls, after, it, was, found, that, plant, cells, could, be, separated, this, theory, extended, to, include, animal, cells, to, suggest, a, universal, mechanism, for, cell, protection, and, development, by, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, microscopy, was, still, not, advanced, enough, to, make, a, distinction, between, cell, membranes, and, cell, walls, however, some, microscopists, correctly, identified, at, this, time, that, while, invisible, it, could, be, inferred, that, cell, membranes, existed, in, animal, cells, due, to, intracellular, movement, of, components, internally, but, not, externally, and, that, membranes, were, not, the, equivalent, of, a, plant, cell, wall, it, was, also, inferred, that, cell, membranes, were, not, vital, components, to, all, cells, many, refuted, the, existence, of, a, cell, membrane, still, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, 1890, an, update, to, the, cell, theory, stated, that, cell, membranes, existed, but, were, merely, secondary, structures, it, was, not, until, later, studies, with, osmosis, and, permeability, that, cell, membranes, gained, more, recognition, in, 1895, ernest, overton, proposed, that, cell, membranes, were, made, of, lipids, the, lipid, bilayer, hypothesis, proposed, in, 1925, by, gorter, and, grendel, created, speculation, in, the, description, of, the, cell, membrane, bilayer, structure, based, on, crystallographic, studies, and, soap, bubble, observations, in, an, attempt, to, accept, or, reject, the, hypothesis, researchers, measured, membrane, thickness, these, researchers, extracted, the, lipid, from, human, red, blood, cells, and, measured, the, amount, of, surface, area, the, lipid, would, cover, when, spread, over, the, surface, of, the, water, since, mature, mammalian, red, blood, cells, lack, both, nuclei, and, cytoplasmic, organelles, the, plasma, membrane, is, the, only, lipid, containing, structure, in, the, cell, consequently, all, of, the, lipids, extracted, from, the, cells, can, be, assumed, to, have, resided, in, the, cells, plasma, membranes, the, ratio, of, the, surface, area, of, water, covered, by, the, extracted, lipid, to, the, surface, area, calculated, for, the, red, blood, cells, from, which, the, lipid, was, 2, 1, approx, and, they, concluded, that, the, plasma, membrane, contains, a, lipid, bilayer, in, 1925, it, was, determined, by, fricke, that, the, thickness, of, erythrocyte, and, yeast, cell, membranes, ranged, between, 3, 3, and, 4, nm, a, thickness, compatible, with, a, lipid, monolayer, the, choice, of, the, dielectric, constant, used, in, these, studies, was, called, into, question, but, future, tests, could, not, disprove, the, results, of, the, initial, experiment, independently, the, leptoscope, was, invented, in, order, to, measure, very, thin, membranes, by, comparing, the, intensity, of, light, reflected, from, a, sample, to, the, intensity, of, a, membrane, standard, of, known, thickness, the, instrument, could, resolve, thicknesses, that, depended, on, ph, measurements, and, the, presence, of, membrane, proteins, that, ranged, from, 8, 6, to, 23, 2, nm, with, the, lower, measurements, supporting, the, lipid, bilayer, hypothesis, later, in, the, 1930s, the, membrane, structure, model, developed, in, general, agreement, to, be, the, paucimolecular, model, of, davson, and, danielli, 1935, this, model, was, based, on, studies, of, surface, tension, between, oils, and, echinoderm, eggs, since, the, surface, tension, values, appeared, to, be, much, lower, than, would, be, expected, for, an, oil, water, interface, it, was, assumed, that, some, substance, was, responsible, for, lowering, the, interfacial, tensions, in, the, surface, of, cells, it, was, suggested, that, a, lipid, bilayer, was, in, between, two, thin, protein, layers, the, paucimolecular, model, immediately, became, popular, and, it, dominated, cell, membrane, studies, for, the, following, 30, years, until, it, became, rivaled, by, the, fluid, mosaic, model, of, singer, and, nicolson, 1972, despite, the, numerous, models, of, the, cell, membrane, proposed, prior, to, the, fluid, mosaic, model, it, remains, the, primary, archetype, for, the, cell, membrane, long, after, its, inception, in, the, 1970s, although, the, fluid, mosaic, model, has, been, modernized, to, detail, contemporary, discoveries, the, basics, have, remained, constant, the, membrane, is, a, lipid, bilayer, composed, of, hydrophilic, exterior, heads, and, a, hydrophobic, interior, where, proteins, can, interact, with, hydrophilic, heads, through, polar, interactions, but, proteins, that, span, the, bilayer, fully, or, partially, have, hydrophobic, amino, acids, that, interact, with, the, non, polar, lipid, interior, the, fluid, mosaic, model, not, only, provided, an, accurate, representation, of, membrane, mechanics, it, enhanced, the, study, of, hydrophobic, forces, which, would, later, develop, into, an, essential, descriptive, limitation, to, describe, biological, macromolecules, for, many, centuries, the, scientists, cited, disagreed, with, the, significance, of, the, structure, they, were, seeing, as, the, cell, membrane, for, almost, two, centuries, the, membranes, were, seen, but, mostly, disregarded, as, an, important, structure, with, cellular, function, it, was, not, until, the, 20th, century, that, the, significance, of, the, cell, membrane, as, it, was, acknowledged, finally, two, scientists, gorter, and, grendel, 1925, made, the, discovery, that, the, membrane, is, lipid, based, from, this, they, furthered, the, idea, that, this, structure, would, have, to, be, in, a, formation, that, mimicked, layers, once, studied, further, it, was, found, by, comparing, the, sum, of, the, cell, surfaces, and, the, surfaces, of, the, lipids, a, 2, 1, ratio, was, estimated, thus, providing, the, first, basis, of, the, bilayer, structure, known, today, this, discovery, initiated, many, new, studies, that, arose, globally, within, various, fields, of, scientific, studies, confirming, that, the, structure, and, functions, of, the, cell, membrane, are, widely, accepted, the, structure, has, been, variously, referred, to, by, different, writers, as, the, ectoplast, de, vries, 1885, plasmahaut, plasma, skin, pfeffer, 1877, 1891, hautschicht, skin, layer, pfeffer, 1886, used, with, a, different, meaning, by, hofmeister, 1867, plasmatic, membrane, pfeffer, 1900, plasma, membrane, cytoplasmic, membrane, cell, envelope, and, cell, membrane, some, authors, who, did, not, believe, that, there, was, a, functional, permeable, boundary, at, the, surface, of, the, cell, preferred, to, use, the, term, plasmalemma, coined, by, mast, 1924, for, the, external, region, of, the, cell, cell, membranes, contain, a, variety, of, biological, molecules, notably, lipids, and, proteins, composition, is, not, set, but, constantly, changing, for, fluidity, and, changes, in, the, environment, even, fluctuating, during, different, stages, of, cell, development, specifically, the, amount, of, cholesterol, in, human, primary, neuron, cell, membrane, changes, and, this, change, in, composition, affects, fluidity, throughout, development, stages, material, is, incorporated, into, the, membrane, or, deleted, from, it, by, a, variety, of, mechanisms, the, cell, membrane, consists, of, three, classes, of, amphipathic, lipids, phospholipids, glycolipids, and, sterols, the, amount, of, each, depends, upon, the, type, of, cell, but, in, the, majority, of, cases, phospholipids, are, the, most, abundant, often, contributing, for, over, 50, of, all, lipids, in, plasma, membranes, glycolipids, only, account, for, a, minute, amount, of, about, 2, and, sterols, make, up, the, rest, in, red, blood, cell, studies, 30, of, the, plasma, membrane, is, lipid, however, for, the, majority, of, eukaryotic, cells, the, composition, of, plasma, membranes, is, about, half, lipids, and, half, proteins, by, weight, the, fatty, chains, in, phospholipids, and, glycolipids, usually, contain, an, even, number, of, carbon, atoms, typically, between, 16, and, 20, the, 16, and, 18, carbon, fatty, acids, are, the, most, common, fatty, acids, may, be, saturated, or, unsaturated, with, the, configuration, of, the, double, bonds, nearly, always, cis, the, length, and, the, degree, of, unsaturation, of, fatty, acid, chains, have, a, profound, effect, on, membrane, fluidity, as, unsaturated, lipids, create, a, kink, preventing, the, fatty, acids, from, packing, together, as, tightly, thus, decreasing, the, melting, temperature, increasing, the, fluidity, of, the, membrane, the, ability, of, some, organisms, to, regulate, the, fluidity, of, their, cell, membranes, by, altering, lipid, composition, is, called, homeoviscous, adaptation, the, entire, membrane, is, held, together, via, non, covalent, interaction, of, hydrophobic, tails, however, the, structure, is, quite, fluid, and, not, fixed, rigidly, in, place, under, physiological, conditions, phospholipid, molecules, in, the, cell, membrane, are, in, the, liquid, crystalline, state, it, means, the, lipid, molecules, are, free, to, diffuse, and, exhibit, rapid, lateral, diffusion, along, the, layer, in, which, they, are, present, however, the, exchange, of, phospholipid, molecules, between, intracellular, and, extracellular, leaflets, of, the, bilayer, is, a, very, slow, process, lipid, rafts, and, caveolae, are, examples, of, cholesterol, enriched, microdomains, in, the, cell, membrane, also, a, fraction, of, the, lipid, in, direct, contact, with, integral, membrane, proteins, which, is, tightly, bound, to, the, protein, surface, is, called, annular, lipid, shell, it, behaves, as, a, part, of, protein, complex, cholesterol, is, normally, found, dispersed, in, varying, degrees, throughout, cell, membranes, in, the, irregular, spaces, between, the, hydrophobic, tails, of, the, membrane, lipids, where, it, confers, a, stiffening, and, strengthening, effect, on, the, membrane, additionally, the, amount, of, cholesterol, in, biological, membranes, varies, between, organisms, cell, types, and, even, in, individual, cells, cholesterol, a, major, component, of, plasma, membranes, regulates, the, fluidity, of, the, overall, membrane, meaning, that, cholesterol, controls, the, amount, of, movement, of, the, various, cell, membrane, components, based, on, its, concentrations, in, high, temperatures, cholesterol, inhibits, the, movement, of, phospholipid, fatty, acid, chains, causing, a, reduced, permeability, to, small, molecules, and, reduced, membrane, fluidity, the, opposite, is, true, for, the, role, of, cholesterol, in, cooler, temperatures, cholesterol, production, and, thus, concentration, is, up, regulated, increased, in, response, to, cold, temperature, at, cold, temperatures, cholesterol, interferes, with, fatty, acid, chain, interactions, acting, as, antifreeze, cholesterol, maintains, the, fluidity, of, the, membrane, cholesterol, is, more, abundant, in, cold, weather, animals, than, warm, weather, animals, in, plants, which, lack, cholesterol, related, compounds, called, sterols, perform, the, same, function, as, cholesterol, lipid, vesicles, or, liposomes, are, approximately, spherical, pockets, that, are, enclosed, by, a, lipid, bilayer, these, structures, are, used, in, laboratories, to, study, the, effects, of, chemicals, in, cells, by, delivering, these, chemicals, directly, to, the, cell, as, well, as, getting, more, insight, into, cell, membrane, permeability, lipid, vesicles, and, liposomes, are, formed, by, first, suspending, a, lipid, in, an, aqueous, solution, then, agitating, the, mixture, through, sonication, resulting, in, a, vesicle, measuring, the, rate, of, efflux, from, the, inside, of, the, vesicle, to, the, ambient, solution, allows, researchers, to, better, understand, membrane, permeability, vesicles, can, be, formed, with, molecules, and, ions, inside, the, vesicle, by, forming, the, vesicle, with, the, desired, molecule, or, ion, present, in, the, solution, proteins, can, also, be, embedded, into, the, membrane, through, solubilizing, the, desired, proteins, in, the, presence, of, detergents, and, attaching, them, to, the, phospholipids, in, which, the, liposome, is, formed, these, provide, researchers, with, a, tool, to, examine, various, membrane, protein, functions, plasma, membranes, also, contain, carbohydrates, predominantly, glycoproteins, but, with, some, glycolipids, cerebrosides, and, gangliosides, carbohydrates, are, important, in, the, role, of, cell, cell, recognition, in, eukaryotes, they, are, located, on, the, surface, of, the, cell, where, they, recognize, host, cells, and, share, information, viruses, that, bind, to, cells, using, these, receptors, cause, an, infection, for, the, most, part, no, glycosylation, occurs, on, membranes, within, the, cell, rather, generally, glycosylation, occurs, on, the, extracellular, surface, of, the, plasma, membrane, the, glycocalyx, is, an, important, feature, in, all, cells, especially, epithelia, with, microvilli, recent, data, suggest, the, glycocalyx, participates, in, cell, adhesion, lymphocyte, homing, and, many, others, the, penultimate, sugar, is, galactose, and, the, terminal, sugar, is, sialic, acid, as, the, sugar, backbone, is, modified, in, the, golgi, apparatus, sialic, acid, carries, a, negative, charge, providing, an, external, barrier, to, charged, particles, the, cell, membrane, has, large, content, of, proteins, typically, around, 50, of, membrane, volume, these, proteins, are, important, for, the, cell, because, they, are, responsible, for, various, biological, activities, approximately, a, third, of, the, genes, in, yeast, code, specifically, for, them, and, this, number, is, even, higher, in, multicellular, organisms, membrane, proteins, consist, of, three, main, types, integral, proteins, peripheral, proteins, and, lipid, anchored, proteins, as, shown, in, the, adjacent, table, integral, proteins, are, amphipathic, transmembrane, proteins, examples, of, integral, proteins, include, ion, channels, proton, pumps, and, g, protein, coupled, receptors, ion, channels, allow, inorganic, ions, such, as, sodium, potassium, calcium, or, chlorine, to, diffuse, down, their, electrochemical, gradient, across, the, lipid, bilayer, through, hydrophilic, pores, across, the, membrane, the, electrical, behavior, of, cells, i, e, nerve, cells, is, controlled, by, ion, channels, proton, pumps, are, protein, pumps, that, are, embedded, in, the, lipid, bilayer, that, allow, protons, to, travel, through, the, membrane, by, transferring, from, one, amino, acid, side, chain, to, another, processes, such, as, electron, transport, and, generating, atp, use, proton, pumps, a, g, protein, coupled, receptor, is, a, single, polypeptide, chain, that, crosses, the, lipid, bilayer, seven, times, responding, to, signal, molecules, i, e, hormones, and, neurotransmitters, g, protein, coupled, receptors, are, used, in, processes, such, as, cell, to, cell, signaling, the, regulation, of, the, production, of, camp, and, the, regulation, of, ion, channels, the, cell, membrane, being, exposed, to, the, outside, environment, is, an, important, site, of, cell, cell, communication, as, such, a, large, variety, of, protein, receptors, and, identification, proteins, such, as, antigens, are, present, on, the, surface, of, the, membrane, functions, of, membrane, proteins, can, also, include, cell, cell, contact, surface, recognition, cytoskeleton, contact, signaling, enzymatic, activity, or, transporting, substances, across, the, membrane, most, membrane, proteins, must, be, inserted, in, some, way, into, the, membrane, for, this, to, occur, an, n, terminus, signal, sequence, of, amino, acids, directs, proteins, to, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, which, inserts, the, proteins, into, a, lipid, bilayer, once, inserted, the, proteins, are, then, transported, to, their, final, destination, in, vesicles, where, the, vesicle, fuses, with, the, target, membrane, the, cell, membrane, surrounds, the, cytoplasm, of, living, cells, physically, separating, the, intracellular, components, from, the, extracellular, environment, the, cell, membrane, also, plays, a, role, in, anchoring, the, cytoskeleton, to, provide, shape, to, the, cell, and, in, attaching, to, the, extracellular, matrix, and, other, cells, to, hold, them, together, to, form, tissues, fungi, bacteria, most, archaea, and, plants, also, have, a, cell, wall, which, provides, a, mechanical, support, to, the, cell, and, precludes, the, passage, of, larger, molecules, the, cell, membrane, is, selectively, permeable, and, able, to, regulate, what, enters, and, exits, the, cell, thus, facilitating, the, transport, of, materials, needed, for, survival, the, movement, of, substances, across, the, membrane, can, be, achieved, by, either, passive, transport, occurring, without, the, input, of, cellular, energy, or, by, active, transport, requiring, the, cell, to, expend, energy, in, transporting, it, the, membrane, also, maintains, the, cell, potential, the, cell, membrane, thus, works, as, a, selective, filter, that, allows, only, certain, things, to, come, inside, or, go, outside, the, cell, the, cell, employs, a, number, of, transport, mechanisms, that, involve, biological, membranes, 1, passive, osmosis, and, diffusion, some, substances, small, molecules, ions, such, as, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, oxygen, o, 2, can, move, across, the, plasma, membrane, by, diffusion, which, is, a, passive, transport, process, because, the, membrane, acts, as, a, barrier, for, certain, molecules, and, ions, they, can, occur, in, different, concentrations, on, the, two, sides, of, the, membrane, diffusion, occurs, when, small, molecules, and, ions, move, freely, from, high, concentration, to, low, concentration, in, order, to, equilibrate, the, membrane, it, is, considered, a, passive, transport, process, because, it, does, not, require, energy, and, is, propelled, by, the, concentration, gradient, created, by, each, side, of, the, membrane, such, a, concentration, gradient, across, a, semipermeable, membrane, sets, up, an, osmotic, flow, for, the, water, osmosis, in, biological, systems, involves, a, solvent, moving, through, a, semipermeable, membrane, similarly, to, passive, diffusion, as, the, solvent, still, moves, with, the, concentration, gradient, and, requires, no, energy, while, water, is, the, most, common, solvent, in, cell, it, can, also, be, other, liquids, as, well, as, supercritical, liquids, and, gases, 2, transmembrane, protein, channels, and, transporters, transmembrane, proteins, extend, through, the, lipid, bilayer, of, the, membranes, they, function, on, both, sides, of, the, membrane, to, transport, molecules, across, it, nutrients, such, as, sugars, or, amino, acids, must, enter, the, cell, and, certain, products, of, metabolism, must, leave, the, cell, such, molecules, can, diffuse, passively, through, protein, channels, such, as, aquaporins, in, facilitated, diffusion, or, are, pumped, across, the, membrane, by, transmembrane, transporters, protein, channel, proteins, also, called, permeases, are, usually, quite, specific, and, they, only, recognize, and, transport, a, limited, variety, of, chemical, substances, often, limited, to, a, single, substance, another, example, of, a, transmembrane, protein, is, a, cell, surface, receptor, which, allow, cell, signaling, molecules, to, communicate, between, cells, 3, endocytosis, endocytosis, is, the, process, in, which, cells, absorb, molecules, by, engulfing, them, the, plasma, membrane, creates, a, small, deformation, inward, called, an, invagination, in, which, the, substance, to, be, transported, is, captured, this, invagination, is, caused, by, proteins, on, the, outside, on, the, cell, membrane, acting, as, receptors, and, clustering, into, depressions, that, eventually, promote, accumulation, of, more, proteins, and, lipids, on, the, cytosolic, side, of, the, membrane, the, deformation, then, pinches, off, from, the, membrane, on, the, inside, of, the, cell, creating, a, vesicle, containing, the, captured, substance, endocytosis, is, a, pathway, for, internalizing, solid, particles, cell, eating, or, phagocytosis, small, molecules, and, ions, cell, drinking, or, pinocytosis, and, macromolecules, endocytosis, requires, energy, and, is, thus, a, form, of, active, transport, 4, exocytosis, just, as, material, can, be, brought, into, the, cell, by, invagination, and, formation, of, a, vesicle, the, membrane, of, a, vesicle, can, be, fused, with, the, plasma, membrane, extruding, its, contents, to, the, surrounding, medium, this, is, the, process, of, exocytosis, exocytosis, occurs, in, various, cells, to, remove, undigested, residues, of, substances, brought, in, by, endocytosis, to, secrete, substances, such, as, hormones, and, enzymes, and, to, transport, a, substance, completely, across, a, cellular, barrier, in, the, process, of, exocytosis, the, undigested, waste, containing, food, vacuole, or, the, secretory, vesicle, budded, from, golgi, apparatus, is, first, moved, by, cytoskeleton, from, the, interior, of, the, cell, to, the, surface, the, vesicle, membrane, comes, in, contact, with, the, plasma, membrane, the, lipid, molecules, of, the, two, bilayers, rearrange, themselves, and, the, two, membranes, are, thus, fused, a, passage, is, formed, in, the, fused, membrane, and, the, vesicles, discharges, its, contents, outside, the, cell, prokaryotes, are, divided, into, two, different, groups, archaea, and, bacteria, with, bacteria, dividing, further, into, gram, positive, and, gram, negative, gram, negative, bacteria, have, both, a, plasma, membrane, and, an, outer, membrane, separated, by, periplasm, however, other, prokaryotes, have, only, a, plasma, membrane, these, two, membranes, differ, in, many, aspects, the, outer, membrane, of, the, gram, negative, bacteria, differs, from, other, prokaryotes, due, to, phospholipids, forming, the, exterior, of, the, bilayer, and, lipoproteins, and, phospholipids, forming, the, interior, the, outer, membrane, typically, has, a, porous, quality, due, to, its, presence, of, membrane, proteins, such, as, gram, negative, porins, which, are, pore, forming, proteins, the, inner, plasma, membrane, is, also, generally, symmetric, whereas, the, outer, membrane, is, asymmetric, because, of, proteins, such, as, the, aforementioned, also, for, the, prokaryotic, membranes, there, are, multiple, things, that, can, affect, the, fluidity, one, of, the, major, factors, that, can, affect, the, fluidity, is, fatty, acid, composition, for, example, when, the, bacteria, staphylococcus, aureus, was, grown, in, 37, c, for, 24h, the, membrane, exhibited, a, more, fluid, state, instead, of, a, gel, like, state, this, supports, the, concept, that, in, higher, temperatures, the, membrane, is, more, fluid, than, in, colder, temperatures, when, the, membrane, is, becoming, more, fluid, and, needs, to, become, more, stabilized, it, will, make, longer, fatty, acid, chains, or, saturated, fatty, acid, chains, in, order, to, help, stabilize, the, membrane, bacteria, are, also, surrounded, by, a, cell, wall, composed, of, peptidoglycan, amino, acids, and, sugars, some, eukaryotic, cells, also, have, cell, walls, but, none, that, are, made, of, peptidoglycan, the, outer, membrane, of, gram, negative, bacteria, is, rich, in, lipopolysaccharides, which, are, combined, poly, or, oligosaccharide, and, carbohydrate, lipid, regions, that, stimulate, the, cell, s, natural, immunity, the, outer, membrane, can, bleb, out, into, periplasmic, protrusions, under, stress, conditions, or, upon, virulence, requirements, while, encountering, a, host, target, cell, and, thus, such, blebs, may, work, as, virulence, organelles, bacterial, cells, provide, numerous, examples, of, the, diverse, ways, in, which, prokaryotic, cell, membranes, are, adapted, with, structures, that, suit, the, organism, s, niche, for, example, proteins, on, the, surface, of, certain, bacterial, cells, aid, in, their, gliding, motion, many, gram, negative, bacteria, have, cell, membranes, which, contain, atp, driven, protein, exporting, systems, according, to, the, fluid, mosaic, model, of, s, j, singer, and, g, l, nicolson, 1972, which, replaced, the, earlier, model, of, davson, and, danielli, biological, membranes, can, be, considered, as, a, two, dimensional, liquid, in, which, lipid, and, protein, molecules, diffuse, more, or, less, easily, although, the, lipid, bilayers, that, form, the, basis, of, the, membranes, do, indeed, form, two, dimensional, liquids, by, themselves, the, plasma, membrane, also, contains, a, large, quantity, of, proteins, which, provide, more, structure, examples, of, such, structures, are, protein, protein, complexes, pickets, and, fences, formed, by, the, actin, based, cytoskeleton, and, potentially, lipid, rafts, lipid, bilayers, form, through, the, process, of, self, assembly, the, cell, membrane, consists, primarily, of, a, thin, layer, of, amphipathic, phospholipids, that, spontaneously, arrange, so, that, the, hydrophobic, tail, regions, are, isolated, from, the, surrounding, water, while, the, hydrophilic, head, regions, interact, with, the, intracellular, cytosolic, and, extracellular, faces, of, the, resulting, bilayer, this, forms, a, continuous, spherical, lipid, bilayer, hydrophobic, interactions, also, known, as, the, hydrophobic, effect, are, the, major, driving, forces, in, the, formation, of, lipid, bilayers, an, increase, in, interactions, between, hydrophobic, molecules, causing, clustering, of, hydrophobic, regions, allows, water, molecules, to, bond, more, freely, with, each, other, increasing, the, entropy, of, the, system, this, complex, interaction, can, include, noncovalent, interactions, such, as, van, der, waals, electrostatic, and, hydrogen, bonds, lipid, bilayers, are, generally, impermeable, to, ions, and, polar, molecules, the, arrangement, of, hydrophilic, heads, and, hydrophobic, tails, of, the, lipid, bilayer, prevent, polar, solutes, ex, amino, acids, nucleic, acids, carbohydrates, proteins, and, ions, from, diffusing, across, the, membrane, but, generally, allows, for, the, passive, diffusion, of, hydrophobic, molecules, this, affords, the, cell, the, ability, to, control, the, movement, of, these, substances, via, transmembrane, protein, complexes, such, as, pores, channels, and, gates, flippases, and, scramblases, concentrate, phosphatidyl, serine, which, carries, a, negative, charge, on, the, inner, membrane, along, with, nana, this, creates, an, extra, barrier, to, charged, moieties, moving, through, the, membrane, membranes, serve, diverse, functions, in, eukaryotic, and, prokaryotic, cells, one, important, role, is, to, regulate, the, movement, of, materials, into, and, out, of, cells, the, phospholipid, bilayer, structure, fluid, mosaic, model, with, specific, membrane, proteins, accounts, for, the, selective, permeability, of, the, membrane, and, passive, and, active, transport, mechanisms, in, addition, membranes, in, prokaryotes, and, in, the, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, of, eukaryotes, facilitate, the, synthesis, of, atp, through, chemiosmosis, the, apical, membrane, or, luminal, membrane, of, a, polarized, cell, is, the, surface, of, the, plasma, membrane, that, faces, inward, to, the, lumen, this, is, particularly, evident, in, epithelial, and, endothelial, cells, but, also, describes, other, polarized, cells, such, as, neurons, the, basolateral, membrane, or, basolateral, cell, membrane, of, a, polarized, cell, is, the, surface, of, the, plasma, membrane, that, forms, its, basal, and, lateral, surfaces, it, faces, outwards, towards, the, interstitium, and, away, from, the, lumen, basolateral, membrane, is, a, compound, phrase, referring, to, the, terms, basal, base, membrane, and, lateral, side, membrane, which, especially, in, epithelial, cells, are, identical, in, composition, and, activity, proteins, such, as, ion, channels, and, pumps, are, free, to, move, from, the, basal, to, the, lateral, surface, of, the, cell, or, vice, versa, in, accordance, with, the, fluid, mosaic, model, tight, junctions, join, epithelial, cells, near, their, apical, surface, to, prevent, the, migration, of, proteins, from, the, basolateral, membrane, to, the, apical, membrane, the, basal, and, lateral, surfaces, thus, remain, roughly, equivalent, to, one, another, yet, distinct, from, the, apical, surface, cell, membrane, can, form, different, types, of, supramembrane, structures, such, as, caveolae, postsynaptic, density, podosomes, invadopodia, focal, adhesion, and, different, types, of, cell, junctions, these, structures, are, usually, responsible, for, cell, adhesion, communication, endocytosis, and, exocytosis, they, can, be, visualized, by, electron, microscopy, or, fluorescence, microscopy, they, are, composed, of, specific, proteins, such, as, integrins, and, cadherins, the, cytoskeleton, is, found, underlying, the, cell, membrane, in, the, cytoplasm, and, provides, a, scaffolding, for, membrane, proteins, to, anchor, to, as, well, as, forming, organelles, that, extend, from, the, cell, indeed, cytoskeletal, elements, interact, extensively, and, intimately, with, the, cell, membrane, anchoring, proteins, restricts, them, to, a, particular, cell, surface, for, example, the, apical, surface, of, epithelial, cells, that, line, the, vertebrate, gut, and, limits, how, far, they, may, diffuse, within, the, bilayer, the, cytoskeleton, is, able, to, form, appendage, like, organelles, such, as, cilia, which, are, microtubule, based, extensions, covered, by, the, cell, membrane, and, filopodia, which, are, actin, based, extensions, these, extensions, are, ensheathed, in, membrane, and, project, from, the, surface, of, the, cell, in, order, to, sense, the, external, environment, and, or, make, contact, with, the, substrate, or, other, cells, the, apical, surfaces, of, epithelial, cells, are, dense, with, actin, based, finger, like, projections, known, as, microvilli, which, increase, cell, surface, area, and, thereby, increase, the, absorption, rate, of, nutrients, localized, decoupling, of, the, cytoskeleton, and, cell, membrane, results, in, formation, of, a, bleb, the, content, of, the, cell, inside, the, cell, membrane, is, composed, of, numerous, membrane, bound, organelles, which, contribute, to, the, overall, function, of, the, cell, the, origin, structure, and, function, of, each, organelle, leads, to, a, large, variation, in, the, cell, composition, due, to, the, individual, uniqueness, associated, with, each, organelle, the, cell, membrane, has, different, lipid, and, protein, compositions, in, distinct, types, of, cells, and, may, have, therefore, specific, names, for, certain, cell, types, the, permeability, of, a, membrane, is, the, rate, of, passive, diffusion, of, molecules, through, the, membrane, these, molecules, are, known, as, permeant, molecules, permeability, depends, mainly, on, the, electric, charge, and, polarity, of, the, molecule, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, molar, mass, of, the, molecule, due, to, the, cell, membrane, s, hydrophobic, nature, small, electrically, neutral, molecules, pass, through, the, membrane, more, easily, than, charged, large, ones, the, inability, of, charged, molecules, to, pass, through, the, cell, membrane, results, in, ph, partition, of, substances, throughout, the, fluid, compartments, of, the, body
