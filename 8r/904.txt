mosses, are, small, non, vascular, flowerless, plants, in, the, taxonomic, division, bryophyta, b, r, a, f, t, b, r, a, f, a, t, sensu, stricto, bryophyta, sensu, lato, schimp, 1879, may, also, refer, to, the, parent, group, bryophytes, which, comprise, liverworts, mosses, and, hornworts, mosses, typically, form, dense, green, clumps, or, mats, often, in, damp, or, shady, locations, the, individual, plants, are, usually, composed, of, simple, leaves, that, are, generally, only, one, cell, thick, attached, to, a, stem, that, may, be, branched, or, unbranched, and, has, only, a, limited, role, in, conducting, water, and, nutrients, although, some, species, have, conducting, tissues, these, are, generally, poorly, developed, and, structurally, different, from, similar, tissue, found, in, vascular, plants, mosses, do, not, have, seeds, and, after, fertilisation, develop, sporophytes, with, unbranched, stalks, topped, with, single, capsules, containing, spores, they, are, typically, 0, 2, 10, cm, 0, 1, 3, 9, in, tall, though, some, species, are, much, larger, dawsonia, the, tallest, moss, in, the, world, can, grow, to, 50, cm, 20, in, in, height, there, are, approximately, 12, 000, species, mosses, are, commonly, confused, with, liverworts, hornworts, and, lichens, although, often, described, as, non, vascular, plants, many, mosses, have, advanced, vascular, systems, like, liverworts, and, hornworts, the, haploid, gametophyte, generation, of, mosses, is, the, dominant, phase, of, the, life, cycle, this, contrasts, with, the, pattern, in, all, vascular, plants, seed, plants, and, pteridophytes, where, the, diploid, sporophyte, generation, is, dominant, lichens, may, superficially, resemble, mosses, and, sometimes, have, common, names, that, include, the, word, moss, e, g, reindeer, moss, or, iceland, moss, but, they, are, fungal, symbioses, and, not, related, to, mosses, 3, the, main, commercial, significance, of, mosses, is, as, the, main, constituent, of, peat, mostly, the, genus, sphagnum, although, they, are, also, used, for, decorative, purposes, such, as, in, gardens, and, in, the, florist, trade, traditional, uses, of, mosses, included, as, insulation, and, for, the, ability, to, absorb, liquids, up, to, 20, times, their, weight, moss, is, a, keystone, genus, and, benefits, habitat, restoration, and, reforestation, botanically, mosses, are, non, vascular, plants, in, the, land, plant, division, bryophyta, they, are, usually, small, a, few, centimeters, tall, herbaceous, non, woody, plants, that, absorb, water, and, nutrients, mainly, through, their, leaves, and, harvest, carbon, dioxide, and, sunlight, to, create, food, by, photosynthesis, with, the, exception, of, the, ancient, group, takakiopsida, no, known, mosses, form, mycorrhiza, but, bryophilous, fungi, is, widespread, in, moss, and, other, bryophytes, where, they, live, as, saprotrophs, parasites, pathogens, and, mutualists, some, of, them, endophytes, mosses, differ, from, vascular, plants, in, lacking, water, bearing, xylem, tracheids, or, vessels, as, in, liverworts, and, hornworts, the, haploid, gametophyte, generation, is, the, dominant, phase, of, the, life, cycle, this, contrasts, with, the, pattern, in, all, vascular, plants, seed, plants, and, pteridophytes, where, the, diploid, sporophyte, generation, is, dominant, mosses, reproduce, using, spores, not, seeds, and, have, no, flowers, moss, gametophytes, have, stems, which, may, be, simple, or, branched, and, upright, acrocarp, or, prostrate, pleurocarp, the, early, divergent, classes, takakiopsida, sphagnopsida, andreaeopsida, and, andreaeobryopsida, either, lack, stomata, or, have, pseudostomata, that, do, not, form, pores, in, the, remaining, classes, stomata, have, been, lost, more, than, 60, times, their, leaves, are, simple, usually, only, a, single, layer, of, cells, with, no, internal, air, spaces, often, with, thicker, midribs, nerves, the, nerve, can, run, beyond, the, edge, of, the, leaf, tip, termed, excurrent, the, tip, of, the, leaf, blade, can, be, extended, as, a, hair, point, made, of, colourless, cells, these, appear, white, against, the, dark, green, of, the, leaves, the, edge, of, the, leaf, can, be, smooth, or, it, may, have, teeth, there, may, be, a, distinct, type, of, cell, defining, the, edge, of, the, leaf, distinct, in, shape, and, or, colour, from, the, other, leaf, cells, moss, has, threadlike, rhizoids, that, anchor, them, to, their, substrate, comparable, to, root, hairs, rather, than, the, more, substantial, root, structures, of, spermatophytes, mosses, do, not, absorb, water, or, nutrients, from, their, substrate, through, their, rhizoids, they, can, be, distinguished, from, liverworts, marchantiophyta, or, hepaticae, by, their, multi, cellular, rhizoids, spore, bearing, capsules, or, sporangia, of, mosses, are, borne, singly, on, long, unbranched, stems, thereby, distinguishing, them, from, the, polysporangiophytes, which, include, all, vascular, plants, the, spore, producing, sporophytes, i, e, the, diploid, multicellular, generation, are, short, lived, and, usually, capable, of, photosynthesis, but, are, dependent, on, the, gametophyte, for, water, supply, and, most, or, all, of, its, nutrients, also, in, the, majority, of, mosses, the, spore, bearing, capsule, enlarges, and, matures, after, its, stalk, elongates, while, in, liverworts, the, capsule, enlarges, and, matures, before, its, stalk, elongates, other, differences, are, not, universal, for, all, mosses, and, all, liverworts, but, the, presence, of, a, clearly, differentiated, stem, with, simple, shaped, non, vascular, leaves, that, are, not, arranged, in, three, ranks, all, point, to, the, plant, being, a, moss, vascular, plants, have, two, sets, of, chromosomes, in, their, vegetative, cells, and, are, said, to, be, diploid, i, e, each, chromosome, has, a, partner, that, contains, the, same, or, similar, genetic, information, by, contrast, mosses, and, other, bryophytes, have, only, a, single, set, of, chromosomes, and, so, are, haploid, i, e, each, chromosome, exists, in, a, unique, copy, within, the, cell, there, is, a, period, in, the, moss, life, cycle, when, they, do, have, a, double, set, of, paired, chromosomes, but, this, happens, only, during, the, sporophyte, stage, the, moss, life, cycle, starts, with, a, haploid, spore, that, germinates, to, produce, a, protonema, pl, protonemata, which, is, either, a, mass, of, thread, like, filaments, or, thalloid, flat, and, thallus, like, massed, moss, protonemata, typically, look, like, a, thin, green, felt, and, may, grow, on, damp, soil, tree, bark, rocks, concrete, or, almost, any, other, reasonably, stable, surface, this, is, a, transitory, stage, in, the, life, of, a, moss, but, from, the, protonema, grows, the, gametophore, gamete, bearer, that, is, structurally, differentiated, into, stems, and, leaves, a, single, mat, of, protonemata, may, develop, several, gametophore, shoots, resulting, in, a, clump, of, moss, from, the, tips, of, the, gametophore, stems, or, branches, develop, the, sex, organs, of, the, mosses, the, female, organs, are, known, as, archegonia, sing, archegonium, and, are, protected, by, a, group, of, modified, leaves, known, as, the, perichaetum, plural, perichaeta, the, archegonia, are, small, flask, shaped, clumps, of, cells, with, an, open, neck, venter, down, which, the, male, sperm, swim, the, male, organs, are, known, as, antheridia, sing, antheridium, and, are, enclosed, by, modified, leaves, called, the, perigonium, pl, perigonia, the, surrounding, leaves, in, some, mosses, form, a, splash, cup, allowing, the, sperm, contained, in, the, cup, to, be, splashed, to, neighboring, stalks, by, falling, water, droplets, gametophore, tip, growth, is, disrupted, by, fungal, chitin, galotto, et, al, 2020, applied, chitooctaose, and, found, that, tips, detected, and, responded, to, this, chitin, derivative, by, changing, gene, expression, they, concluded, that, this, defense, response, was, probably, conserved, from, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, bryophytes, and, tracheophytes, orr, et, al, 2020, found, that, the, microtubules, of, growing, tip, cells, were, structurally, similar, to, f, actin, and, served, a, similar, purpose, mosses, can, be, either, dioicous, compare, dioecious, in, seed, plants, or, monoicous, compare, monoecious, in, dioicous, mosses, male, and, female, sex, organs, are, borne, on, different, gametophyte, plants, in, monoicous, also, called, autoicous, mosses, both, are, borne, on, the, same, plant, in, the, presence, of, water, sperm, from, the, antheridia, swim, to, the, archegonia, and, fertilisation, occurs, leading, to, the, production, of, a, diploid, sporophyte, the, sperm, of, mosses, is, biflagellate, i, e, they, have, two, flagellae, that, aid, in, propulsion, since, the, sperm, must, swim, to, the, archegonium, fertilisation, cannot, occur, without, water, some, species, for, example, mnium, hornum, or, several, species, of, polytrichum, keep, their, antheridia, in, so, called, splash, cups, bowl, like, structures, on, the, shoot, tips, that, propel, the, sperm, several, decimeters, when, water, droplets, hit, it, increasing, the, fertilization, distance, after, fertilisation, the, immature, sporophyte, pushes, its, way, out, of, the, archegonial, venter, it, takes, several, months, for, the, sporophyte, to, mature, the, sporophyte, body, comprises, a, long, stalk, called, a, seta, and, a, capsule, capped, by, a, cap, called, the, operculum, the, capsule, and, operculum, are, in, turn, sheathed, by, a, haploid, calyptra, which, is, the, remains, of, the, archegonial, venter, the, calyptra, usually, falls, off, when, the, capsule, is, mature, within, the, capsule, spore, producing, cells, undergo, meiosis, to, form, haploid, spores, upon, which, the, cycle, can, start, again, the, mouth, of, the, capsule, is, usually, ringed, by, a, set, of, teeth, called, peristome, this, may, be, absent, in, some, mosses, most, mosses, rely, on, the, wind, to, disperse, the, spores, in, the, genus, sphagnum, the, spores, are, projected, about, 10, 20, cm, 4, 8, in, off, the, ground, by, compressed, air, contained, in, the, capsules, the, spores, are, accelerated, to, about, 36, 000, times, the, earth, s, gravitational, acceleration, g, it, has, recently, been, found, that, microarthropods, such, as, springtails, and, mites, can, effect, moss, fertilization, and, that, this, process, is, mediated, by, moss, emitted, scents, male, and, female, fire, moss, for, example, emit, different, and, complex, volatile, organic, scents, female, plants, emit, more, compounds, than, male, plants, springtails, were, found, to, choose, female, plants, preferentially, and, one, study, found, that, springtails, enhance, moss, fertilization, suggesting, a, scent, mediated, relationship, analogous, to, the, plant, pollinator, relationship, found, in, many, seed, plants, the, stinkmoss, species, splachnum, sphaericum, develops, insect, pollination, further, by, attracting, flies, to, its, sporangia, with, a, strong, smell, of, carrion, and, providing, a, strong, visual, cue, in, the, form, of, red, coloured, swollen, collars, beneath, each, spore, capsule, flies, attracted, to, the, moss, carry, its, spores, to, fresh, herbivore, dung, which, is, the, favoured, habitat, of, the, species, of, this, genus, in, many, mosses, e, g, ulota, phyllantha, green, vegetative, structures, called, gemmae, are, produced, on, leaves, or, branches, which, can, break, off, and, form, new, plants, without, the, need, to, go, through, the, cycle, of, fertilization, this, is, a, means, of, asexual, reproduction, and, the, genetically, identical, units, can, lead, to, the, formation, of, clonal, populations, moss, dwarf, males, also, known, as, nannandry, or, phyllodioicy, originate, from, wind, dispersed, male, spores, that, settle, and, germinate, on, the, female, shoot, where, their, growth, is, restricted, to, a, few, millimeters, in, some, species, dwarfness, is, genetically, determined, in, that, all, male, spores, become, dwarf, more, often, it, is, environmentally, determined, in, that, male, spores, that, land, on, a, female, become, dwarf, while, those, that, land, elsewhere, develop, into, large, female, sized, males, in, the, latter, case, dwarf, males, that, are, transplanted, from, females, to, another, substrate, develop, into, large, shoots, suggesting, that, the, females, emit, a, substance, which, inhibits, the, growth, of, germinating, males, and, possibly, also, quickens, their, onset, of, sexual, maturation, the, nature, of, such, a, substance, is, unknown, but, the, phytohormone, auxin, may, be, involved, having, the, males, growing, as, dwarfs, on, the, female, is, expected, to, increase, the, fertilization, efficiency, by, minimizing, the, distance, between, male, and, female, reproductive, organs, accordingly, it, has, been, observed, that, fertilization, frequency, is, positively, associated, with, the, presence, of, dwarf, males, in, several, phyllodioicous, species, dwarf, males, occur, in, several, unrelated, lineages, and, may, be, more, common, than, previously, thought, for, example, it, is, estimated, that, between, one, quarter, and, half, of, all, dioicous, pleurocarps, have, dwarf, males, the, moss, physcomitrium, patens, has, been, used, as, a, model, organism, to, study, how, plants, repair, damage, to, their, dna, especially, the, repair, mechanism, known, as, homologous, recombination, if, the, plant, cannot, repair, dna, damage, e, g, double, strand, breaks, in, their, somatic, cells, the, cells, can, lose, normal, functions, or, die, if, this, occurs, during, meiosis, part, of, sexual, reproduction, they, could, become, infertile, the, genome, of, p, patens, has, been, sequenced, which, has, allowed, several, genes, involved, in, dna, repair, to, be, identified, p, patens, mutants, that, are, defective, in, key, steps, of, homologous, recombination, have, been, used, to, work, out, how, the, repair, mechanism, functions, in, plants, for, example, a, study, of, p, patens, mutants, defective, in, rp, rad51, a, gene, that, encodes, a, protein, at, the, core, of, the, recombinational, repair, reaction, indicated, that, homologous, recombination, is, essential, for, repairing, dna, double, strand, breaks, in, this, plant, similarly, studies, of, mutants, defective, in, ppmre11, or, pprad50, that, encode, key, proteins, of, the, mrn, complex, the, principal, sensor, of, dna, double, strand, breaks, showed, that, these, genes, are, necessary, for, repair, of, dna, damage, as, well, as, for, normal, growth, and, development, more, recently, mosses, have, been, grouped, with, the, liverworts, and, hornworts, in, the, division, bryophyta, bryophytes, or, bryophyta, sensu, lato, the, bryophyte, division, itself, contains, three, former, divisions, bryophyta, mosses, marchantiophyta, liverworts, and, anthocerotophyta, hornworts, it, has, been, proposed, that, these, latter, divisions, are, de, ranked, to, the, classes, bryopsida, marchantiopsida, and, anthocerotopsida, respectively, the, mosses, and, liverworts, are, now, considered, to, belong, to, a, clade, called, setaphyta, the, mosses, bryophyta, sensu, stricto, are, divided, into, eight, classes, vascular, plants, hornworts, liverworts, takakiopsida, sphagnopsida, andreaeopsida, andreaeobryopsida, oedipodiopsida, polytrichopsida, tetraphidopsida, bryopsida, six, of, the, eight, classes, contain, only, one, or, two, genera, each, polytrichopsida, includes, 23, genera, and, bryopsida, includes, the, majority, of, moss, diversity, with, over, 95, of, moss, species, belonging, to, this, class, the, sphagnopsida, the, peat, mosses, comprise, the, two, living, genera, ambuchanania, and, sphagnum, as, well, as, fossil, taxa, sphagnum, is, a, diverse, widespread, and, economically, important, one, these, large, mosses, form, extensive, acidic, bogs, in, peat, swamps, the, leaves, of, sphagnum, have, large, dead, cells, alternating, with, living, photosynthetic, cells, the, dead, cells, help, to, store, water, aside, from, this, character, the, unique, branching, thallose, flat, and, expanded, protonema, and, explosively, rupturing, sporangium, place, it, apart, from, other, mosses, andreaeopsida, and, andreaeobryopsida, are, distinguished, by, the, biseriate, two, rows, of, cells, rhizoids, multiseriate, many, rows, of, cells, protonema, and, sporangium, that, splits, along, longitudinal, lines, most, mosses, have, capsules, that, open, at, the, top, polytrichopsida, have, leaves, with, sets, of, parallel, lamellae, flaps, of, chloroplast, containing, cells, that, look, like, the, fins, on, a, heat, sink, these, carry, out, photosynthesis, and, may, help, to, conserve, moisture, by, partially, enclosing, the, gas, exchange, surfaces, the, polytrichopsida, differ, from, other, mosses, in, other, details, of, their, development, and, anatomy, too, and, can, also, become, larger, than, most, other, mosses, with, e, g, polytrichum, commune, forming, cushions, up, to, 40, cm, 16, in, high, the, tallest, land, moss, a, member, of, the, polytrichidae, is, probably, dawsonia, superba, a, native, to, new, zealand, and, other, parts, of, australasia, the, fossil, record, of, moss, is, sparse, due, to, their, soft, walled, and, fragile, nature, unambiguous, moss, fossils, have, been, recovered, from, as, early, as, the, permian, of, antarctica, and, russia, and, a, case, has, been, made, for, carboniferous, mosses, it, has, further, been, claimed, that, tube, like, fossils, from, the, silurian, are, the, macerated, remains, of, moss, calyptr, mosses, also, appear, to, evolve, 2, 3, times, slower, than, ferns, gymnosperms, and, angiosperms, recent, research, shows, that, ancient, moss, could, explain, why, the, ordovician, ice, ages, occurred, when, the, ancestors, of, today, s, moss, started, to, spread, on, land, 470, million, years, ago, they, absorbed, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, and, extracted, minerals, by, secreting, organic, acids, that, dissolved, the, rocks, they, were, growing, on, these, chemically, altered, rocks, in, turn, reacted, with, the, atmospheric, co, 2, and, formed, new, carbonate, rocks, in, the, ocean, through, the, weathering, of, calcium, and, magnesium, ions, from, silicate, rocks, the, weathered, rocks, also, released, significant, amounts, of, phosphorus, and, iron, which, ended, up, in, the, oceans, where, it, caused, massive, algal, blooms, resulting, in, organic, carbon, burial, extracting, more, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, small, organisms, feeding, on, the, nutrients, created, large, areas, without, oxygen, which, caused, a, mass, extinction, of, marine, species, while, the, levels, of, co, 2, dropped, all, over, the, world, allowing, the, formation, of, ice, caps, on, the, poles, moss, gametophytes, are, autotrophic, and, require, sunlight, to, perform, photosynthesis, shade, tolerance, varies, by, species, just, as, it, does, with, higher, plants, in, most, areas, mosses, grow, chiefly, in, moist, shaded, areas, such, as, wooded, areas, and, at, the, edges, of, streams, but, they, can, grow, anywhere, in, cool, humid, cloudy, climates, and, some, species, are, adapted, to, sunny, seasonally, dry, areas, like, alpine, rocks, or, stabilized, sand, dunes, choice, of, substrate, varies, by, species, as, well, moss, species, can, be, classed, as, growing, on, rocks, exposed, mineral, soil, disturbed, soils, acid, soil, calcareous, soil, cliff, seeps, and, waterfall, spray, areas, streamsides, shaded, humusy, soil, downed, logs, burnt, stumps, tree, trunk, bases, upper, tree, trunks, and, tree, branches, or, in, bogs, moss, species, growing, on, or, under, trees, are, often, specific, about, the, species, of, trees, they, grow, on, such, as, preferring, conifers, over, broadleaf, trees, oaks, over, alders, or, vice, versa, while, mosses, often, grow, on, trees, as, epiphytes, they, are, never, parasitic, on, the, tree, mosses, are, also, found, in, cracks, between, paving, stones, in, damp, city, streets, and, on, roofs, some, species, adapted, to, disturbed, sunny, areas, are, well, adapted, to, urban, conditions, and, are, commonly, found, in, cities, examples, would, be, rhytidiadelphus, squarrosus, a, garden, weed, in, vancouver, and, seattle, areas, bryum, argenteum, the, cosmopolitan, sidewalk, moss, and, ceratodon, purpureus, red, roof, moss, another, cosmopolitan, species, a, few, species, are, wholly, aquatic, such, as, fontinalis, antipyretica, common, water, moss, and, others, such, as, sphagnum, inhabit, bogs, marshes, and, very, slow, moving, waterways, such, aquatic, or, semi, aquatic, mosses, can, greatly, exceed, the, normal, range, of, lengths, seen, in, terrestrial, mosses, individual, plants, 20, 30, cm, 8, 12, in, or, more, long, are, common, in, sphagnum, species, for, example, but, even, aquatic, species, of, moss, and, other, bryophytes, needs, their, mature, capsules, to, be, exposed, to, air, by, seta, elongation, or, seasonal, lowering, of, water, level, to, be, able, to, reproduce, wherever, they, occur, mosses, require, liquid, water, for, at, least, part, of, the, year, to, complete, fertilisation, many, mosses, can, survive, desiccation, sometimes, for, months, returning, to, life, within, a, few, hours, of, rehydration, it, is, generally, believed, that, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, north, side, of, trees, and, rocks, will, generally, have, more, luxuriant, moss, growth, on, average, than, other, sides, the, reason, is, assumed, to, be, because, sunshine, on, the, south, side, causes, a, dry, environment, the, reverse, would, be, true, in, the, southern, hemisphere, some, naturalists, feel, that, mosses, grow, on, the, damper, side, of, trees, and, rocks, in, some, cases, such, as, sunny, climates, in, temperate, northern, latitudes, this, will, be, the, shaded, north, side, of, the, tree, or, rock, on, steep, slopes, it, may, be, the, uphill, side, for, mosses, that, grow, on, tree, branches, this, is, generally, the, upper, side, of, the, branch, on, horizontally, growing, sections, or, near, the, crotch, in, cool, humid, cloudy, climates, all, sides, of, tree, trunks, and, rocks, may, be, equally, moist, enough, for, moss, growth, each, species, of, moss, requires, certain, amounts, of, moisture, and, sunlight, and, thus, will, grow, on, certain, sections, of, the, same, tree, or, rock, some, mosses, grow, underwater, or, completely, waterlogged, many, prefer, well, drained, locations, there, are, mosses, that, preferentially, grow, on, rocks, and, tree, trunks, of, various, chemistries, in, boreal, forests, some, species, of, moss, play, an, important, role, in, providing, nitrogen, for, the, ecosystem, due, to, their, relationship, with, nitrogen, fixing, cyanobacteria, cyanobacteria, colonize, moss, and, receive, shelter, in, return, for, providing, fixed, nitrogen, moss, releases, the, fixed, nitrogen, along, with, other, nutrients, into, the, soil, upon, disturbances, like, drying, rewetting, and, fire, events, making, it, available, throughout, the, ecosystem, moss, is, often, considered, a, weed, in, grass, lawns, but, is, deliberately, encouraged, to, grow, under, aesthetic, principles, exemplified, by, japanese, gardening, in, old, temple, gardens, moss, can, carpet, a, forest, scene, moss, is, thought, to, add, a, sense, of, calm, age, and, stillness, to, a, garden, scene, moss, is, also, used, in, bonsai, to, cover, the, soil, and, enhance, the, impression, of, age, rules, of, cultivation, are, not, widely, established, moss, collections, are, quite, often, begun, using, samples, transplanted, from, the, wild, in, a, water, retaining, bag, some, species, of, moss, can, be, extremely, difficult, to, maintain, away, from, their, natural, sites, with, their, unique, requirements, of, combinations, of, light, humidity, substrate, chemistry, shelter, from, wind, etc, growing, moss, from, spores, is, even, less, controlled, moss, spores, fall, in, a, constant, rain, on, exposed, surfaces, those, surfaces, which, are, hospitable, to, a, certain, species, of, moss, will, typically, be, colonised, by, that, moss, within, a, few, years, of, exposure, to, wind, and, rain, materials, which, are, porous, and, moisture, retentive, such, as, brick, wood, and, certain, coarse, concrete, mixtures, are, hospitable, to, moss, surfaces, can, also, be, prepared, with, acidic, substances, including, buttermilk, yogurt, urine, and, gently, pur, ed, mixtures, of, moss, samples, water, and, ericaceous, compost, in, the, cool, humid, cloudy, pacific, northwest, moss, is, sometimes, allowed, to, grow, naturally, as, a, moss, lawn, one, that, needs, little, or, no, mowing, fertilizing, or, watering, in, this, case, grass, is, considered, to, be, the, weed, landscapers, in, the, seattle, area, sometimes, collect, boulders, and, downed, logs, growing, mosses, for, installation, in, gardens, and, landscapes, woodland, gardens, in, many, parts, of, the, world, can, include, a, carpet, of, natural, mosses, the, bloedel, reserve, on, bainbridge, island, washington, state, is, famous, for, its, moss, garden, the, moss, garden, was, created, by, removing, shrubby, underbrush, and, herbaceous, groundcovers, thinning, trees, and, allowing, mosses, to, fill, in, naturally, mosses, are, sometimes, used, in, green, roofs, advantages, of, mosses, over, higher, plants, in, green, roofs, include,
