sexual, reproduction, is, a, type, of, reproduction, that, involves, a, complex, life, cycle, in, which, a, gamete, haploid, reproductive, cells, such, as, a, sperm, or, egg, cell, with, a, single, set, of, chromosomes, combines, with, another, gamete, to, produce, a, zygote, that, develops, into, an, organism, composed, of, cells, with, two, sets, of, chromosomes, diploid, this, is, typical, in, animals, though, the, number, of, chromosome, sets, and, how, that, number, changes, in, sexual, reproduction, varies, especially, among, plants, fungi, and, other, eukaryotes, in, placental, mammals, the, sperm, cells, exit, from, the, urethra, through, the, penis, for, males, while, the, egg, cells, exit, through, the, oviduct, to, the, uterus, for, females, other, vertebrates, of, both, sexes, possess, a, cloaca, for, the, release, of, sperm, or, egg, cells, sexual, reproduction, is, the, most, common, life, cycle, in, multicellular, eukaryotes, such, as, animals, fungi, and, plants, sexual, reproduction, also, occurs, in, some, unicellular, eukaryotes, sexual, reproduction, does, not, occur, in, prokaryotes, unicellular, organisms, without, cell, nuclei, such, as, bacteria, and, archaea, however, some, processes, in, bacteria, including, bacterial, conjugation, transformation, and, transduction, may, be, considered, analogous, to, sexual, reproduction, in, that, they, incorporate, new, genetic, information, some, proteins, and, other, features, that, are, key, for, sexual, reproduction, may, have, arisen, in, bacteria, but, sexual, reproduction, is, believed, to, have, developed, in, an, ancient, eukaryotic, ancestor, in, eukaryotes, diploid, precursor, cells, divide, to, produce, haploid, cells, in, a, process, called, meiosis, in, meiosis, dna, is, replicated, to, produce, a, total, of, four, copies, of, each, chromosome, this, is, followed, by, two, cell, divisions, to, generate, haploid, gametes, after, the, dna, is, replicated, in, meiosis, the, homologous, chromosomes, pair, up, so, that, their, dna, sequences, are, aligned, with, each, other, during, this, period, before, cell, divisions, genetic, information, is, exchanged, between, homologous, chromosomes, in, genetic, recombination, homologous, chromosomes, contain, highly, similar, but, not, identical, information, and, by, exchanging, similar, but, not, identical, regions, genetic, recombination, increases, genetic, diversity, among, future, generations, during, sexual, reproduction, two, haploid, gametes, combine, into, one, diploid, cell, known, as, a, zygote, in, a, process, called, fertilization, the, nuclei, from, the, gametes, fuse, and, each, gamete, contributes, half, of, the, genetic, material, of, the, zygote, multiple, cell, divisions, by, mitosis, without, change, in, the, number, of, chromosomes, then, develop, into, a, multicellular, diploid, phase, or, generation, in, plants, the, diploid, phase, known, as, the, sporophyte, produces, spores, by, meiosis, these, spores, then, germinate, and, divide, by, mitosis, to, form, a, haploid, multicellular, phase, the, gametophyte, which, produces, gametes, directly, by, mitosis, this, type, of, life, cycle, involving, alternation, between, two, multicellular, phases, the, sexual, haploid, gametophyte, and, asexual, diploid, sporophyte, is, known, as, alternation, of, generations, the, evolution, of, sexual, reproduction, is, considered, paradoxical, because, asexual, reproduction, should, be, able, to, outperform, it, as, every, young, organism, created, can, bear, its, own, young, this, implies, that, an, asexual, population, has, an, intrinsic, capacity, to, grow, more, rapidly, with, each, generation, this, 50, cost, is, a, fitness, disadvantage, of, sexual, reproduction, the, two, fold, cost, of, sex, includes, this, cost, and, the, fact, that, any, organism, can, only, pass, on, 50, of, its, own, genes, to, its, offspring, however, one, definite, advantage, of, sexual, reproduction, is, that, it, increases, genetic, diversity, and, impedes, the, accumulation, of, harmful, genetic, mutations, sexual, selection, is, a, mode, of, natural, selection, in, which, some, individuals, out, reproduce, others, of, a, population, because, they, are, better, at, securing, mates, for, sexual, reproduction, it, has, been, described, as, a, powerful, evolutionary, force, that, does, not, exist, in, asexual, populations, the, first, fossilized, evidence, of, sexual, reproduction, in, eukaryotes, is, from, the, stenian, period, about, 1, 05, billion, years, old, biologists, studying, evolution, propose, several, explanations, for, the, development, of, sexual, reproduction, and, its, maintenance, these, reasons, include, reducing, the, likelihood, of, the, accumulation, of, deleterious, mutations, increasing, rate, of, adaptation, to, changing, environments, dealing, with, competition, dna, repair, masking, deleterious, mutations, and, reducing, genetic, variation, on, the, genomic, level, all, of, these, ideas, about, why, sexual, reproduction, has, been, maintained, are, generally, supported, but, ultimately, the, size, of, the, population, determines, if, sexual, reproduction, is, entirely, beneficial, larger, populations, appear, to, respond, more, quickly, to, some, of, the, benefits, obtained, through, sexual, reproduction, than, do, smaller, population, sizes, however, newer, models, presented, in, recent, years, suggest, a, basic, advantage, for, sexual, reproduction, in, slowly, reproducing, complex, organisms, sexual, reproduction, allows, these, species, to, exhibit, characteristics, that, depend, on, the, specific, environment, that, they, inhabit, and, the, particular, survival, strategies, that, they, employ, in, order, to, reproduce, sexually, both, males, and, females, need, to, find, a, mate, generally, in, animals, mate, choice, is, made, by, females, while, males, compete, to, be, chosen, this, can, lead, organisms, to, extreme, efforts, in, order, to, reproduce, such, as, combat, and, display, or, produce, extreme, features, caused, by, a, positive, feedback, known, as, a, fisherian, runaway, thus, sexual, reproduction, as, a, form, of, natural, selection, has, an, effect, on, evolution, sexual, dimorphism, is, where, the, basic, phenotypic, traits, vary, between, males, and, females, of, the, same, species, dimorphism, is, found, in, both, sex, organs, and, in, secondary, sex, characteristics, body, size, physical, strength, and, morphology, biological, ornamentation, behavior, and, other, bodily, traits, however, sexual, selection, is, only, implied, over, an, extended, period, of, time, leading, to, sexual, dimorphism, a, few, arthropods, such, as, barnacles, are, hermaphroditic, that, is, each, can, have, the, organs, of, both, sexes, however, individuals, of, most, species, remain, of, one, sex, their, entire, lives, a, few, species, of, insects, and, crustaceans, can, reproduce, by, parthenogenesis, especially, if, conditions, favor, a, population, explosion, however, most, arthropods, rely, on, sexual, reproduction, and, parthenogenetic, species, often, revert, to, sexual, reproduction, when, conditions, become, less, favorable, the, ability, to, undergo, meiosis, is, widespread, among, arthropods, including, both, those, that, reproduce, sexually, and, those, that, reproduce, parthenogenetically, although, meiosis, is, a, major, characteristic, of, arthropods, understanding, of, its, fundamental, adaptive, benefit, has, long, been, regarded, as, an, unresolved, problem, that, appears, to, have, remained, unsettled, aquatic, arthropods, may, breed, by, external, fertilization, as, for, example, horseshoe, crabs, do, or, by, internal, fertilization, where, the, ova, remain, in, the, female, s, body, and, the, sperm, must, somehow, be, inserted, all, known, terrestrial, arthropods, use, internal, fertilization, opiliones, harvestmen, millipedes, and, some, crustaceans, use, modified, appendages, such, as, gonopods, or, penises, to, transfer, the, sperm, directly, to, the, female, however, most, male, terrestrial, arthropods, produce, spermatophores, waterproof, packets, of, sperm, which, the, females, take, into, their, bodies, a, few, such, species, rely, on, females, to, find, spermatophores, that, have, already, been, deposited, on, the, ground, but, in, most, cases, males, only, deposit, spermatophores, when, complex, courtship, rituals, look, likely, to, be, successful, insect, species, make, up, more, than, two, thirds, of, all, extant, animal, species, most, insect, species, reproduce, sexually, though, some, species, are, facultatively, parthenogenetic, many, insect, species, have, sexual, dimorphism, while, in, others, the, sexes, look, nearly, identical, typically, they, have, two, sexes, with, males, producing, spermatozoa, and, females, ova, the, ova, develop, into, eggs, that, have, a, covering, called, the, chorion, which, forms, before, internal, fertilization, insects, have, very, diverse, mating, and, reproductive, strategies, most, often, resulting, in, the, male, depositing, a, spermatophore, within, the, female, which, she, stores, until, she, is, ready, for, egg, fertilization, after, fertilization, and, the, formation, of, a, zygote, and, varying, degrees, of, development, in, many, species, the, eggs, are, deposited, outside, the, female, while, in, others, they, develop, further, within, the, female, and, the, young, are, born, live, there, are, three, extant, kinds, of, mammals, monotremes, placentals, and, marsupials, all, with, internal, fertilization, in, placental, mammals, offspring, are, born, as, juveniles, complete, animals, with, the, sex, organs, present, although, not, reproductively, functional, after, several, months, or, years, depending, on, the, species, the, sex, organs, develop, further, to, maturity, and, the, animal, becomes, sexually, mature, most, female, mammals, are, only, fertile, during, certain, periods, during, their, estrous, cycle, at, which, point, they, are, ready, to, mate, male, mammals, ejaculate, semen, through, the, penis, into, the, female, reproductive, tract, during, copulation, for, most, mammals, males, and, females, exchange, sexual, partners, throughout, their, adult, lives, the, vast, majority, of, fish, species, lay, eggs, that, are, then, fertilized, by, the, male, some, species, lay, their, eggs, on, a, substrate, like, a, rock, or, on, plants, while, others, scatter, their, eggs, and, the, eggs, are, fertilized, as, they, drift, or, sink, in, the, water, column, some, fish, species, use, internal, fertilization, and, then, disperse, the, developing, eggs, or, give, birth, to, live, offspring, fish, that, have, live, bearing, offspring, include, the, guppy, and, mollies, or, poecilia, fishes, that, give, birth, to, live, young, can, be, ovoviviparous, where, the, eggs, are, fertilized, within, the, female, and, the, eggs, simply, hatch, within, the, female, body, or, in, seahorses, the, male, carries, the, developing, young, within, a, pouch, and, gives, birth, to, live, young, fishes, can, also, be, viviparous, where, the, female, supplies, nourishment, to, the, internally, growing, offspring, some, fish, are, hermaphrodites, where, a, single, fish, is, both, male, and, female, and, can, produce, eggs, and, sperm, in, hermaphroditic, fish, some, are, male, and, female, at, the, same, time, while, in, other, fish, they, are, serially, hermaphroditic, starting, as, one, sex, and, changing, to, the, other, in, at, least, one, hermaphroditic, species, self, fertilization, occurs, when, the, eggs, and, sperm, are, released, together, internal, self, fertilization, may, occur, in, some, other, species, one, fish, species, does, not, reproduce, by, sexual, reproduction, but, uses, sex, to, produce, offspring, poecilia, formosa, is, a, unisex, species, that, uses, a, form, of, parthenogenesis, called, gynogenesis, where, unfertilized, eggs, develop, into, embryos, that, produce, female, offspring, poecilia, formosa, mate, with, males, of, other, fish, species, that, use, internal, fertilization, the, sperm, does, not, fertilize, the, eggs, but, stimulates, the, growth, of, the, eggs, which, develops, into, embryos, animals, have, life, cycles, with, a, single, diploid, multicellular, phase, that, produces, haploid, gametes, directly, by, meiosis, male, gametes, are, called, sperm, and, female, gametes, are, called, eggs, or, ova, in, animals, fertilization, of, the, ovum, by, a, sperm, results, in, the, formation, of, a, diploid, zygote, that, develops, by, repeated, mitotic, divisions, into, a, diploid, adult, plants, have, two, multicellular, life, cycle, phases, resulting, in, an, alternation, of, generations, plant, zygotes, germinate, and, divide, repeatedly, by, mitosis, to, produce, a, diploid, multicellular, organism, known, as, the, sporophyte, the, mature, sporophyte, produces, haploid, spores, by, meiosis, that, germinate, and, divide, by, mitosis, to, form, a, multicellular, gametophyte, phase, that, produces, gametes, at, maturity, the, gametophytes, of, different, groups, of, plants, vary, in, size, mosses, and, other, pteridophytic, plants, may, have, gametophytes, consisting, of, several, million, cells, while, angiosperms, have, as, few, as, three, cells, in, each, pollen, grain, flowering, plants, are, the, dominant, plant, form, on, land, 168, 173, and, they, reproduce, either, sexually, or, asexually, often, their, most, distinctive, feature, is, their, reproductive, organs, commonly, called, flowers, the, anther, produces, pollen, grains, which, contain, the, male, gametophytes, that, produce, sperm, nuclei, for, pollination, to, occur, pollen, grains, must, attach, to, the, stigma, of, the, female, reproductive, structure, carpel, where, the, female, gametophytes, are, located, within, ovules, enclose, within, the, ovary, after, the, pollen, tube, grows, through, the, carpel, s, style, the, sex, cell, nuclei, from, the, pollen, grain, migrate, into, the, ovule, to, fertilize, the, egg, cell, and, endosperm, nuclei, within, the, female, gametophyte, in, a, process, termed, double, fertilization, the, resulting, zygote, develops, into, an, embryo, while, the, triploid, endosperm, one, sperm, cell, plus, two, female, cells, and, female, tissues, of, the, ovule, give, rise, to, the, surrounding, tissues, in, the, developing, seed, the, ovary, which, produced, the, female, gametophyte, s, then, grows, into, a, fruit, which, surrounds, the, seed, s, plants, may, either, self, pollinate, or, cross, pollinate, in, 2013, flowers, dating, from, the, cretaceous, 100, million, years, before, present, were, found, encased, in, amber, the, oldest, evidence, of, sexual, reproduction, in, a, flowering, plant, microscopic, images, showed, tubes, growing, out, of, pollen, and, penetrating, the, flower, s, stigma, the, pollen, was, sticky, suggesting, it, was, carried, by, insects, ferns, produce, large, diploid, sporophytes, with, rhizomes, roots, and, leaves, fertile, leaves, produce, sporangia, that, contain, haploid, spores, the, spores, are, released, and, germinate, to, produce, small, thin, gametophytes, that, are, typically, heart, shaped, and, green, in, color, the, gametophyte, prothalli, produce, motile, sperm, in, the, antheridia, and, egg, cells, in, archegonia, on, the, same, or, different, plants, after, rains, or, when, dew, deposits, a, film, of, water, the, motile, sperm, are, splashed, away, from, the, antheridia, which, are, normally, produced, on, the, top, side, of, the, thallus, and, swim, in, the, film, of, water, to, the, archegonia, where, they, fertilize, the, egg, to, promote, out, crossing, or, cross, fertilization, the, sperm, are, released, before, the, eggs, are, receptive, of, the, sperm, making, it, more, likely, that, the, sperm, will, fertilize, the, eggs, of, different, thallus, after, fertilization, a, zygote, is, formed, which, grows, into, a, new, sporophytic, plant, the, condition, of, having, separate, sporophyte, and, gametophyte, plants, is, called, alternation, of, generations, the, bryophytes, which, include, liverworts, hornworts, and, mosses, reproduce, both, sexually, and, vegetatively, they, are, small, plants, found, growing, in, moist, locations, and, like, ferns, have, motile, sperm, with, flagella, and, need, water, to, facilitate, sexual, reproduction, these, plants, start, as, a, haploid, spore, that, grows, into, the, dominant, gametophyte, form, which, is, a, multicellular, haploid, body, with, leaf, like, structures, that, photosynthesize, haploid, gametes, are, produced, in, antheridia, male, and, archegonia, female, by, mitosis, the, sperm, released, from, the, antheridia, respond, to, chemicals, released, by, ripe, archegonia, and, swim, to, them, in, a, film, of, water, and, fertilize, the, egg, cells, thus, producing, a, zygote, the, zygote, divides, by, mitotic, division, and, grows, into, a, multicellular, diploid, sporophyte, the, sporophyte, produces, spore, capsules, sporangia, which, are, connected, by, stalks, setae, to, the, archegonia, the, spore, capsules, produce, spores, by, meiosis, and, when, ripe, the, capsules, burst, open, to, release, the, spores, bryophytes, show, considerable, variation, in, their, reproductive, structures, and, the, above, is, a, basic, outline, also, in, some, species, each, plant, is, one, sex, dioicous, while, other, species, produce, both, sexes, on, the, same, plant, monoicous, fungi, are, classified, by, the, methods, of, sexual, reproduction, they, employ, the, outcome, of, sexual, reproduction, most, often, is, the, production, of, resting, spores, that, are, used, to, survive, inclement, times, and, to, spread, there, are, typically, three, phases, in, the, sexual, reproduction, of, fungi, plasmogamy, karyogamy, and, meiosis, the, cytoplasm, of, two, parent, cells, fuse, during, plasmogamy, and, the, nuclei, fuse, during, karyogamy, new, haploid, gametes, are, formed, during, meiosis, and, develop, into, spores, the, adaptive, basis, for, the, maintenance, of, sexual, reproduction, in, the, ascomycota, and, basidiomycota, dikaryon, fungi, was, reviewed, by, wallen, and, perlin, they, concluded, that, the, most, plausible, reason, for, maintaining, this, capability, is, the, benefit, of, repairing, dna, damage, caused, by, a, variety, of, stresses, through, recombination, that, occurs, during, meiosis, three, distinct, processes, in, prokaryotes, are, regarded, as, similar, to, eukaryotic, sex, bacterial, transformation, which, involves, the, incorporation, of, foreign, dna, into, the, bacterial, chromosome, bacterial, conjugation, which, is, a, transfer, of, plasmid, dna, between, bacteria, but, the, plasmids, are, rarely, incorporated, into, the, bacterial, chromosome, and, gene, transfer, and, genetic, exchange, in, archaea, bacterial, transformation, involves, the, recombination, of, genetic, material, and, its, function, is, mainly, associated, with, dna, repair, bacterial, transformation, is, a, complex, process, encoded, by, numerous, bacterial, genes, and, is, a, bacterial, adaptation, for, dna, transfer, this, process, occurs, naturally, in, at, least, 40, bacterial, species, for, a, bacterium, to, bind, take, up, and, recombine, exogenous, dna, into, its, chromosome, it, must, enter, a, special, physiological, state, referred, to, as, competence, see, natural, competence, sexual, reproduction, in, early, single, celled, eukaryotes, may, have, evolved, from, bacterial, transformation, or, from, a, similar, process, in, archaea, see, below, on, the, other, hand, bacterial, conjugation, is, a, type, of, direct, transfer, of, dna, between, two, bacteria, mediated, by, an, external, appendage, called, the, conjugation, pilus, bacterial, conjugation, is, controlled, by, plasmid, genes, that, are, adapted, for, spreading, copies, of, the, plasmid, between, bacteria, the, infrequent, integration, of, a, plasmid, into, a, host, bacterial, chromosome, and, the, subsequent, transfer, of, a, part, of, the, host, chromosome, to, another, cell, do, not, appear, to, be, bacterial, adaptations, exposure, of, hyperthermophilic, archaeal, sulfolobus, species, to, dna, damaging, conditions, induces, cellular, aggregation, accompanied, by, high, frequency, genetic, marker, exchange, ajon, et, al, hypothesized, that, this, cellular, aggregation, enhances, species, specific, dna, repair, by, homologous, recombination, dna, transfer, in, sulfolobus, may, be, an, early, form, of, sexual, interaction, similar, to, the, more, well, studied, bacterial, transformation, systems, that, also, involve, species, specific, dna, transfer, leading, to, homologous, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage
