human, papillomavirus, infection, hpv, infection, is, caused, by, a, dna, virus, from, the, papillomaviridae, family, many, hpv, infections, cause, no, symptoms, and, 90, resolve, spontaneously, within, two, years, in, some, cases, an, hpv, infection, persists, and, results, in, either, warts, or, precancerous, lesions, these, lesions, depending, on, the, site, affected, increase, the, risk, of, cancer, of, the, cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, tonsils, or, throat, nearly, all, cervical, cancer, is, due, to, hpv, and, two, strains, hpv16, and, hpv18, account, for, 70, of, all, cases, hpv16, is, responsible, for, almost, 90, of, hpv, positive, oropharyngeal, cancers, between, 60, and, 90, of, the, other, cancers, listed, above, are, also, linked, to, hpv, hpv6, and, hpv11, are, common, causes, of, genital, warts, and, laryngeal, papillomatosis, an, hpv, infection, is, caused, by, the, human, papillomavirus, a, dna, virus, from, the, papillomavirus, family, over, 200, types, have, been, described, an, individual, can, become, infected, with, more, than, one, type, of, hpv, and, the, disease, is, only, known, to, affect, humans, more, than, 40, types, may, be, spread, through, sexual, contact, and, infect, the, anus, and, genitals, risk, factors, for, persistent, infection, by, sexually, transmitted, types, include, early, age, of, first, sexual, intercourse, multiple, sexual, partners, smoking, and, poor, immune, function, these, types, are, typically, spread, by, sustained, direct, skin, to, skin, contact, with, vaginal, and, anal, sex, being, the, most, common, methods, hpv, infection, can, also, spread, from, a, mother, to, baby, during, pregnancy, there, is, no, evidence, that, hpv, can, spread, via, common, items, like, toilet, seats, but, the, types, that, cause, warts, may, spread, via, surfaces, such, as, floors, hpv, is, not, killed, by, common, hand, sanitizers, and, disinfectants, increasing, the, possibility, of, the, virus, being, transferred, via, non, living, infectious, agents, called, fomites, hpv, vaccines, can, prevent, the, most, common, types, of, infection, to, be, most, effective, inoculation, should, occur, before, the, onset, of, sexual, activity, and, are, therefore, recommended, between, the, ages, of, 9, 13, years, cervical, cancer, screening, such, as, the, papanicolaou, test, pap, smear, or, examination, of, the, cervix, after, applying, acetic, acid, can, detect, both, early, cancer, and, abnormal, cells, that, may, develop, into, cancer, screening, allows, for, early, treatment, which, results, in, better, outcomes, screening, has, reduced, both, the, number, of, cases, and, the, number, of, deaths, from, cervical, cancer, genital, warts, can, be, removed, by, freezing, nearly, every, sexually, active, individual, is, infected, by, hpv, at, some, point, in, their, lives, hpv, is, the, most, common, sexually, transmitted, infection, sti, globally, high, risk, hpvs, cause, about, 5, of, all, cancers, worldwide, and, about, 37, 300, cases, of, cancer, in, the, united, states, each, year, cervical, cancer, is, among, the, most, common, cancers, worldwide, causing, an, estimated, 604, 000, new, cases, and, 342, 000, deaths, in, 2020, about, 90, of, these, new, cases, and, deaths, of, cervical, cancer, occurred, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, roughly, 1, of, sexually, active, adults, have, genital, warts, cases, of, skin, warts, have, been, described, since, the, time, of, ancient, greece, but, it, was, not, until, 1907, that, they, were, determined, to, be, caused, by, a, virus, hpv, is, a, group, of, more, than, 200, related, viruses, which, are, designated, by, a, number, for, each, virus, type, some, hpv, types, such, as, hpv5, may, establish, infections, that, persist, for, the, lifetime, of, the, individual, without, ever, manifesting, any, clinical, symptoms, hpv, types, 1, and, 2, can, cause, common, warts, in, some, infected, individuals, hpv, types, 6, and, 11, can, cause, genital, warts, and, laryngeal, papillomatosis, many, hpv, types, are, carcinogenic, about, twelve, hpv, types, including, types, 16, 18, 31, and, 45, are, called, high, risk, types, because, persistent, infection, has, been, linked, to, cancer, of, the, oropharynx, larynx, vulva, vagina, cervix, penis, and, anus, these, cancers, all, involve, sexually, transmitted, infection, of, hpv, to, the, stratified, epithelial, tissue, hpv, type, 16, is, the, strain, most, likely, to, cause, cancer, and, is, present, in, about, 47, of, all, cervical, cancers, and, in, many, vaginal, and, vulvar, cancers, penile, cancers, anal, cancers, and, cancers, of, the, head, and, neck, the, table, below, lists, common, symptoms, of, hpv, infection, and, the, associated, types, of, hpv, available, hpv, vaccines, protect, against, either, two, four, or, nine, types, of, hpv, there, are, six, prophylactic, hpv, vaccines, licensed, for, use, the, bivalent, vaccines, cervarix, cecolin, and, walrinvax, the, quadrivalent, vaccines, cervavax, and, gardasil, and, the, nonavalent, vaccine, gardasil, 9, all, hpv, vaccines, protect, against, at, least, hpv, types, 16, and, 18, which, cause, the, greatest, risk, of, cervical, cancer, the, quadrivalent, vaccines, also, protect, against, hpv, types, 6, and, 11, the, nonavalent, vaccine, gardasil, 9, provides, protection, against, those, four, types, 6, 11, 16, and, 18, along, with, five, other, high, risk, hpv, types, responsible, for, 20, of, cervical, cancers, types, 31, 33, 45, 52, and, 58, skin, infection, cutaneous, infection, with, hpv, is, very, widespread, skin, infections, with, hpv, can, cause, noncancerous, skin, growths, called, warts, verrucae, warts, are, caused, by, a, rapid, growth, of, cells, on, the, outer, layer, of, the, skin, while, cases, of, warts, have, been, described, since, the, time, of, ancient, greece, their, viral, cause, was, not, known, until, 1907, skin, warts, are, most, common, in, childhood, and, typically, appear, and, regress, spontaneously, over, the, course, of, weeks, to, months, recurring, skin, warts, are, common, all, hpvs, are, believed, to, be, capable, of, establishing, long, term, latent, infections, in, small, numbers, of, stem, cells, present, in, the, skin, although, these, latent, infections, may, never, be, fully, eradicated, immunological, control, is, thought, to, block, the, appearance, of, symptoms, such, as, warts, immunological, control, is, hpv, type, specific, meaning, an, individual, may, become, resistant, to, one, hpv, type, while, remaining, susceptible, to, other, types, types, of, warts, include, common, flat, and, plantar, warts, are, much, less, likely, to, spread, from, person, to, person, hpv, infection, of, the, skin, in, the, genital, area, is, the, most, common, sexually, transmitted, infection, worldwide, such, infections, are, associated, with, genital, or, anal, warts, medically, known, as, condylomata, acuminata, or, venereal, warts, and, these, warts, are, the, most, easily, recognized, sign, of, genital, hpv, infection, the, strains, of, hpv, that, can, cause, genital, warts, are, usually, different, from, those, that, cause, warts, on, other, parts, of, the, body, such, as, the, hands, or, feet, or, even, the, inner, thighs, a, wide, variety, of, hpv, types, can, cause, genital, warts, but, types, 6, and, 11, together, account, for, about, 90, of, all, cases, however, in, total, more, than, 40, types, of, hpv, are, transmitted, through, sexual, contact, and, can, infect, the, skin, of, the, anus, and, genitals, such, infections, may, cause, genital, warts, although, they, may, also, remain, asymptomatic, the, great, majority, of, genital, hpv, infections, never, cause, any, overt, symptoms, and, are, cleared, by, the, immune, system, in, a, matter, of, months, moreover, people, may, transmit, the, virus, to, others, even, if, they, do, not, display, overt, symptoms, of, infection, most, people, acquire, genital, hpv, infections, at, some, point, in, their, lives, and, about, 10, of, women, are, currently, infected, a, large, increase, in, the, incidence, of, genital, hpv, infection, occurs, at, the, age, when, individuals, begin, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, as, with, cutaneous, hpvs, immunity, to, genital, hpv, is, believed, to, be, specific, to, a, specific, strain, of, hpv, in, addition, to, genital, warts, infection, by, hpv, types, 6, and, 11, can, cause, a, rare, condition, known, as, recurrent, laryngeal, papillomatosis, in, which, warts, form, on, the, larynx, or, other, areas, of, the, respiratory, tract, these, warts, can, recur, frequently, may, interfere, with, breathing, and, in, extremely, rare, cases, can, progress, to, cancer, for, these, reasons, repeated, surgery, to, remove, the, warts, may, be, advisable, cervical, cancer, is, among, the, most, common, cancers, worldwide, causing, an, estimated, 604, 000, new, cases, and, 342, 000, deaths, in, 2020, about, 90, of, these, new, cases, and, deaths, of, cervical, cancer, occurred, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, where, screening, tests, and, treatment, of, early, cervical, cell, changes, are, not, readily, available, in, the, united, states, about, 37, 300, cases, of, cancer, due, to, hpv, occur, each, year, in, some, infected, individuals, their, immune, systems, may, fail, to, control, hpv, lingering, infection, with, high, risk, hpv, types, such, as, types, 16, 18, 31, and, 45, can, favor, the, development, of, cancer, co, factors, such, as, cigarette, smoke, can, also, enhance, the, risk, of, such, hpv, related, cancers, hpv, is, believed, to, cause, cancer, by, integrating, its, genome, into, nuclear, dna, some, of, the, early, genes, expressed, by, hpv, such, as, e6, and, e7, act, as, oncogenes, that, promote, tumor, growth, and, malignant, transformation, hpv, genome, integration, can, also, cause, carcinogenesis, by, promoting, genomic, instability, associated, with, alterations, in, dna, copy, number, e6, produces, a, protein, also, called, e6, that, simultaneously, binds, to, two, host, cell, proteins, called, p53, and, e6, associated, protein, e6, ap, e6ap, is, an, e3, ubiquitin, ligase, an, enzyme, whose, purpose, is, to, tag, proteins, with, a, post, translational, modification, called, ubiquitin, by, binding, both, proteins, e6, induces, e6ap, to, attach, a, chain, of, ubiquitin, molecules, to, p53, thereby, flagging, p53, for, proteosomal, degradation, normally, p53, acts, to, prevent, cell, growth, and, promotes, cell, death, in, the, presence, of, dna, damage, p53, also, upregulates, the, p21, protein, which, blocks, the, formation, of, the, cyclin, d, cdk4, complex, thereby, preventing, the, phosphorylation, of, retinoblastoma, protein, rb, and, in, turn, halting, cell, cycle, progression, by, preventing, the, activation, of, e2f, in, short, p53, is, a, tumor, suppressor, protein, that, arrests, the, cell, cycle, and, prevents, cell, growth, and, survival, when, dna, damage, occurs, thus, the, degradation, of, p53, induced, by, e6, promotes, unregulated, cell, division, cell, growth, and, cell, survival, all, characteristics, of, cancer, it, is, important, to, note, that, while, the, interaction, between, e6, e6ap, and, p53, was, the, first, to, be, characterized, there, are, multiple, other, proteins, in, the, host, cell, which, interact, with, e6, and, assist, the, induction, of, cancer, studies, have, also, shown, a, link, between, a, wide, range, of, hpv, types, and, squamous, cell, carcinoma, of, the, skin, in, such, cases, in, vitro, studies, suggest, that, the, e6, protein, of, the, hpv, virus, may, inhibit, apoptosis, induced, by, ultraviolet, light, nearly, all, cases, of, cervical, cancer, are, associated, with, hpv, infection, with, two, types, hpv16, and, hpv18, present, in, 70, of, cases, in, 2012, twelve, hpv, types, were, considered, carcinogenic, for, cervical, cancer, by, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and, 59, one, study, found, that, 74, of, squamous, cell, carcinomas, and, 78, of, adenocarcinomas, tested, positive, for, hpv, types, 16, or, 18, persistent, hpv, infection, increases, the, risk, for, developing, cervical, carcinoma, individuals, who, have, an, increased, incidence, of, these, types, of, infection, are, women, with, hiv, aids, who, are, at, a, 22, fold, increased, risk, of, cervical, cancer, the, carcinogenic, hpv, types, in, cervical, cancer, belong, to, the, alphapapillomavirus, genus, and, can, be, grouped, further, into, hpv, clades, the, two, major, carcinogenic, hpv, clades, alphapapillomavirus, 9, a9, and, alphapapillomavirus, 7, a7, contain, hpv16, and, hpv18, respectively, these, two, hpv, clades, were, shown, to, have, different, effects, on, tumour, molecular, characteristics, and, patient, prognosis, with, clade, a7, being, associated, with, more, aggressive, pathways, and, an, inferior, prognosis, in, 2020, about, 604, 000, new, cases, and, 342, 000, deaths, from, cervical, cancer, occurred, worldwide, around, 90, of, these, occurred, in, the, developing, world, most, hpv, infections, of, the, cervix, are, cleared, rapidly, by, the, immune, system, and, do, not, progress, to, cervical, cancer, see, below, the, clearance, subsection, in, virology, because, the, process, of, transforming, normal, cervical, cells, into, cancerous, ones, is, slow, cancer, occurs, in, people, having, been, infected, with, hpv, for, a, long, time, usually, over, a, decade, or, more, persistent, infection, furthermore, both, the, hpv, infection, and, cervical, cancer, drive, metabolic, modifications, that, may, be, correlated, with, the, aberrant, regulation, of, enzymes, related, to, metabolic, pathways, non, european, ne, hpv16, variants, are, significantly, more, carcinogenic, than, european, e, hpv16, variants, the, risk, for, anal, cancer, is, 17, to, 31, times, higher, among, hiv, positive, individuals, who, were, coinfected, with, high, risk, hpv, and, 80, times, higher, for, particularly, hiv, positive, men, who, have, sex, with, men, anal, pap, smear, screening, for, anal, cancer, might, benefit, some, subpopulations, of, men, or, women, engaging, in, anal, sex, no, consensus, exists, though, that, such, screening, is, beneficial, or, who, should, get, an, anal, pap, smear, hpv, is, associated, with, approximately, 50, of, penile, cancers, in, the, united, states, penile, cancer, accounts, for, about, 0, 5, of, all, cancer, cases, in, men, hpv16, is, the, most, commonly, associated, type, detected, the, risk, of, penile, cancer, increases, 2, to, 3, fold, for, individuals, who, are, infected, with, hiv, as, well, as, hpv, oral, infection, with, high, risk, carcinogenic, hpv, types, most, commonly, hpv, 16, is, associated, with, an, increasing, number, of, head, and, neck, cancers, this, association, is, independent, of, tobacco, and, alcohol, use, the, local, percentage, varies, widely, from, 70, in, the, united, states, to, 4, in, brazil, engaging, in, anal, or, oral, sex, with, an, hpv, infected, partner, may, increase, the, risk, of, developing, these, types, of, cancers, in, the, united, states, the, number, of, newly, diagnosed, hpv, associated, head, and, neck, cancers, has, surpassed, that, of, cervical, cancer, cases, the, rate, of, such, cancers, has, increased, from, an, estimated, 0, 8, cases, per, 100, 000, people, in, 1988, to, 4, 5, per, 100, 000, in, 2012, and, as, of, 2021, the, rate, has, continued, to, increase, researchers, explain, these, recent, data, by, an, increase, in, oral, sex, this, type, of, cancer, is, more, common, in, men, than, in, women, the, mutational, profile, of, hpv, positive, and, hpv, negative, head, and, neck, cancer, has, been, reported, further, demonstrating, that, they, are, fundamentally, distinct, diseases, some, evidence, links, hpv, to, benign, and, malignant, tumors, of, the, upper, respiratory, tract, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, has, found, that, people, with, lung, cancer, were, significantly, more, likely, to, have, several, high, risk, forms, of, hpv, antibodies, compared, to, those, who, did, not, have, lung, cancer, researchers, looking, for, hpv, among, 1, 633, lung, cancer, patients, and, 2, 729, people, without, the, lung, disease, found, that, people, with, lung, cancer, had, more, types, of, hpv, than, noncancer, patients, did, and, among, lung, cancer, patients, the, chances, of, having, eight, types, of, serious, hpv, were, significantly, increased, in, addition, expression, of, hpv, structural, proteins, by, immunohistochemistry, and, in, vitro, studies, suggest, hpv, presence, in, bronchial, cancer, and, its, precursor, lesions, another, study, detected, hpv, in, the, exhaled, breath, condensate, ebc, bronchial, brushing, and, neoplastic, lung, tissue, of, cases, and, found, a, presence, of, an, hpv, infection, in, 16, 4, of, the, subjects, affected, by, nonsmall, cell, lung, cancer, but, in, none, of, the, controls, the, reported, average, frequencies, of, hpv, in, lung, cancers, were, 17, and, 15, in, europe, and, the, americas, respectively, and, the, mean, number, of, hpv, in, asian, lung, cancer, samples, was, 35, 7, with, a, considerable, heterogeneity, between, certain, countries, and, regions, in, very, rare, cases, hpv, may, cause, epidermodysplasia, verruciformis, ev, in, individuals, with, a, weakened, immune, system, the, virus, unchecked, by, the, immune, system, causes, the, overproduction, of, keratin, by, skin, cells, resulting, in, lesions, resembling, warts, or, cutaneous, horns, which, can, ultimately, transform, into, skin, cancer, but, the, development, is, not, well, understood, the, specific, types, of, hpv, that, are, associated, with, ev, are, hpv5, hpv8, and, hpv14, sexually, transmitted, hpv, is, divided, into, two, categories, low, risk, and, high, risk, low, risk, hpvs, cause, warts, on, or, around, the, genitals, type, 6, and, 11, cause, 90, of, all, genital, warts, and, recurrent, respiratory, papillomatosis, that, causes, benign, tumors, in, the, air, passages, high, risk, hpvs, cause, cancer, and, consist, of, about, twelve, identified, types, types, 16, and, 18, are, responsible, for, causing, most, of, hpv, caused, cancers, these, high, risk, hpvs, cause, 5, of, the, cancers, in, the, world, in, the, united, states, high, risk, hpvs, cause, 3, of, all, cancer, cases, in, women, and, 2, in, men, risk, factors, for, persistent, genital, hpv, infections, which, increases, the, risk, for, developing, cancer, include, early, age, of, first, sexual, intercourse, multiple, partners, smoking, and, immunosuppression, genital, hpv, is, spread, by, sustained, direct, skin, to, skin, contact, with, vaginal, anal, and, oral, sex, being, the, most, common, methods, occasionally, it, can, spread, from, manual, sex, or, from, a, mother, to, her, baby, during, pregnancy, hpv, is, difficult, to, remove, via, standard, hospital, disinfection, techniques, and, may, be, transmitted, in, a, healthcare, setting, on, re, usable, gynecological, equipment, such, as, vaginal, ultrasound, transducers, the, period, of, communicability, is, still, unknown, but, probably, at, least, as, long, as, visible, hpv, lesions, persist, hpv, may, still, be, transmitted, even, after, lesions, are, treated, and, no, longer, visible, or, present, although, genital, hpv, types, can, be, transmitted, from, mother, to, child, during, birth, the, appearance, of, genital, hpv, related, diseases, in, newborns, is, rare, however, the, lack, of, appearance, does, not, rule, out, asymptomatic, latent, infection, as, the, virus, has, proven, to, be, capable, of, hiding, for, decades, perinatal, transmission, of, hpv, types, 6, and, 11, can, result, in, the, development, of, juvenile, onset, recurrent, respiratory, papillomatosis, jorrp, jorrp, is, very, rare, with, rates, of, about, 2, cases, per, 100, 000, children, in, the, united, states, although, jorrp, rates, are, substantially, higher, if, a, woman, presents, with, genital, warts, at, the, time, of, giving, birth, the, risk, of, jorrp, in, such, cases, is, still, less, than, 1, genital, hpv, infections, are, transmitted, primarily, by, contact, with, the, genitals, anus, or, mouth, of, an, infected, sexual, partner, of, the, 120, known, human, papilloma, viruses, 51, species, and, three, subtypes, infect, the, genital, mucosa, fifteen, are, classified, as, high, risk, types, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and, 82, three, as, probable, high, risk, 26, 53, and, 66, and, twelve, as, low, risk, 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and, 89, condoms, do, not, completely, protect, from, the, virus, because, the, areas, around, the, genitals, including, the, inner, thigh, area, are, not, covered, thus, exposing, these, areas, to, the, infected, person, s, skin, studies, have, shown, hpv, transmission, between, hands, and, genitals, of, the, same, person, and, sexual, partners, hernandez, tested, the, genitals, and, dominant, hand, of, each, person, in, 25, heterosexual, couples, every, other, month, for, an, average, of, seven, months, she, found, two, couples, where, the, man, s, genitals, infected, the, woman, s, hand, with, high, risk, hpv, two, where, her, hand, infected, his, genitals, one, where, her, genitals, infected, his, hand, two, each, where, he, infected, his, own, hand, and, she, infected, her, own, hand, hands, were, not, the, main, source, of, transmission, in, these, 25, couples, but, they, were, significant, partridge, reports, men, s, fingertips, became, positive, for, high, risk, hpv, at, more, than, half, the, rate, 26, per, two, years, as, their, genitals, 48, winer, reports, 14, of, fingertip, samples, from, sexually, active, women, were, positive, non, sexual, hand, contact, seems, to, have, little, or, no, role, in, hpv, transmission, winer, found, all, fourteen, fingertip, samples, from, virgin, women, negative, at, the, start, of, her, fingertip, study, in, a, separate, report, on, genital, hpv, infection, 1, of, virgin, women, 1, of, 76, with, no, sexual, contact, tested, positive, for, hpv, while, 10, of, virgin, women, reporting, non, penetrative, sexual, contact, were, positive, 7, of, 72, sharing, of, possibly, contaminated, objects, for, example, razors, may, transmit, hpv, although, possible, transmission, by, routes, other, than, sexual, intercourse, is, less, common, for, female, genital, hpv, infection, fingers, genital, contact, is, a, possible, way, of, transmission, but, unlikely, to, be, a, significant, source, though, it, has, traditionally, been, assumed, that, hpv, is, not, transmissible, via, blood, as, it, is, thought, to, only, infect, cutaneous, and, mucosal, tissues, recent, studies, have, called, this, notion, into, question, historically, hpv, dna, has, been, detected, in, the, blood, of, cervical, cancer, patients, in, 2005, a, group, reported, that, in, frozen, blood, samples, of, 57, sexually, naive, pediatric, patients, who, had, vertical, or, transfusion, acquired, hiv, infection, 8, 14, 0, of, these, samples, also, tested, positive, for, hpv, 16, this, seems, to, indicate, that, it, may, be, possible, for, hpv, to, be, transmitted, via, blood, transfusion, however, as, non, sexual, transmission, of, hpv, by, other, means, is, not, uncommon, this, could, not, be, definitively, proven, in, 2009, a, group, tested, australian, red, cross, blood, samples, from, 180, healthy, male, donors, for, hpv, and, subsequently, found, dna, of, one, or, more, strains, of, the, virus, in, 15, 8, 3, of, the, samples, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, detecting, the, presence, of, hpv, dna, in, blood, is, not, the, same, as, detecting, the, virus, itself, in, blood, and, whether, or, not, the, virus, itself, can, or, does, reside, in, blood, in, infected, individuals, is, still, unknown, as, such, it, remains, to, be, determined, whether, hpv, can, or, cannot, be, transmitted, via, blood, this, is, of, concern, as, blood, donations, are, not, currently, screened, for, hpv, and, at, least, some, organizations, such, as, the, american, red, cross, and, other, red, cross, societies, do, not, presently, appear, to, disallow, hpv, positive, individuals, from, donating, blood, hospital, transmission, of, hpv, especially, to, surgical, staff, has, been, documented, surgeons, including, urologists, and, or, anyone, in, the, room, is, subject, to, hpv, infection, by, inhalation, of, noxious, viral, particles, during, electrocautery, or, laser, ablation, of, a, condyloma, wart, there, has, been, a, case, report, of, a, laser, surgeon, who, developed, extensive, laryngeal, papillomatosis, after, providing, laser, ablation, to, patients, with, anogenital, condylomata, hpv, infection, is, limited, to, the, basal, cells, of, stratified, epithelium, the, only, tissue, in, which, they, replicate, the, virus, cannot, bind, to, live, tissue, instead, it, infects, epithelial, tissues, through, micro, abrasions, or, other, epithelial, trauma, that, exposes, segments, of, the, basement, membrane, the, infectious, process, is, slow, taking, 12, 24, hours, for, initiation, of, transcription, it, is, believed, that, involved, antibodies, play, a, major, neutralizing, role, while, the, virions, still, reside, on, the, basement, membrane, and, cell, surfaces, hpv, lesions, are, thought, to, arise, from, the, proliferation, of, infected, basal, keratinocytes, infection, typically, occurs, when, basal, cells, in, the, host, are, exposed, to, the, infectious, virus, through, a, disturbed, epithelial, barrier, as, would, occur, during, sexual, intercourse, or, after, minor, skin, abrasions, hpv, infections, have, not, been, shown, to, be, cytolytic, rather, viral, particles, are, released, as, a, result, of, degeneration, of, desquamating, cells, hpv, can, survive, for, many, months, and, at, low, temperatures, without, a, host, therefore, an, individual, with, plantar, warts, can, spread, the, virus, by, walking, barefoot, hpv, is, a, small, double, stranded, circular, dna, virus, with, a, genome, of, approximately, 8000, base, pairs, the, hpv, life, cycle, strictly, follows, the, differentiation, program, of, the, host, keratinocyte, it, is, thought, that, the, hpv, virion, infects, epithelial, tissues, through, micro, abrasions, whereby, the, virion, associates, with, putative, receptors, such, as, alpha, integrins, laminins, and, annexin, a2, leading, to, entry, of, the, virions, into, basal, epithelial, cells, through, clathrin, mediated, endocytosis, and, or, caveolin, mediated, endocytosis, depending, on, the, type, of, hpv, at, this, point, the, viral, genome, is, transported, to, the, nucleus, by, unknown, mechanisms, and, establishes, itself, at, a, copy, number, of, 10, 200, viral, genomes, per, cell, a, sophisticated, transcriptional, cascade, then, occurs, as, the, host, keratinocyte, begins, to, divide, and, become, increasingly, differentiated, in, the, upper, layers, of, the, epithelium, the, phylogeny, of, the, various, strains, of, hpv, generally, reflects, the, migration, patterns, of, homo, sapiens, and, suggests, that, hpv, may, have, diversified, along, with, the, human, population, studies, suggest, that, hpv, evolved, along, five, major, branches, that, reflect, the, ethnicity, of, human, hosts, and, diversified, along, with, the, human, population, researchers, initially, identified, two, major, variants, of, hpv16, european, hpv16, e, and, non, european, hpv16, ne, more, recent, analyses, based, on, thousands, of, hpv16, genomes, show, that, indeed, two, major, clades, exist, that, are, further, subdivided, into, four, lineages, designated, a, d, and, even, further, subdivided, into, 16, sublineages, a1, 4, b1, 4, c1, 4, and, d1, 4, the, a1, a3, sublineages, constitute, the, european, variant, a4, the, asian, variant, b1, b4, the, african, type, i, variant, c1, c4, the, african, type, ii, variant, d1, the, north, american, variant, d2, the, asian, american, type, i, variant, d3, the, asian, american, type, ii, variant, the, various, lineages, and, sublineages, have, different, oncogenic, capacity, where, overall, the, non, european, lineages, are, considered, to, increase, the, risk, for, cancer, although, hpv16, is, a, dna, virus, there, are, signs, of, recombination, among, the, different, lineages, based, on, an, analysis, of, more, than, 3600, genomes, between, 0, 3, and, 1, 2, of, them, could, be, recombinant, thus, ideally, genotyping, for, cancer, risk, assessment, of, hpv16, should, not, be, based, only, on, certain, genes, but, on, all, genes, from, the, entire, genome, a, bioinformatics, tool, named, hpv16, genotyper, performs, i, hpv16, lineage, genotyping, ii, it, detects, potential, recombination, events, iii, it, identifies, within, the, submitted, sequences, mutations, snps, that, have, been, reported, in, literature, to, increase, the, risk, for, cancer, the, two, primary, oncoproteins, of, high, risk, hpv, types, are, e6, and, e7, the, e, designation, indicates, that, these, two, proteins, are, early, proteins, expressed, early, in, the, hpv, life, cycle, while, the, l, designation, indicates, that, they, are, late, proteins, late, expression, the, hpv, genome, is, composed, of, six, early, e1, e2, e4, e5, e6, and, e7, open, reading, frames, orf, two, late, l1, and, l2, orfs, and, a, non, coding, long, control, region, lcr, after, the, host, cell, is, infected, viral, early, promoter, is, activated, and, a, polycistronic, primary, rna, containing, all, six, early, orfs, is, transcribed, this, polycistronic, rna, then, undergoes, active, rna, splicing, to, generate, multiple, isoforms, of, mrnas, one, of, the, spliced, isoform, rnas, e6, i, serves, as, an, e7, mrna, to, translate, e7, protein, however, viral, early, transcription, subjects, to, viral, e2, regulation, and, high, e2, levels, repress, the, transcription, hpv, genomes, integrate, into, host, genome, by, disruption, of, e2, orf, preventing, e2, repression, on, e6, and, e7, thus, viral, genome, integration, into, host, dna, genome, increases, e6, and, e7, expression, to, promote, cellular, proliferation, and, the, chance, of, malignancy, the, degree, to, which, e6, and, e7, are, expressed, is, correlated, with, the, type, of, cervical, lesion, that, can, ultimately, develop, sometimes, papillomavirus, genomes, are, found, integrated, into, the, host, genome, and, this, is, especially, noticeable, with, oncogenic, hpvs, the, e6, e7, proteins, inactivate, two, tumor, suppressor, proteins, p53, inactivated, by, e6, and, prb, inactivated, by, e7, the, viral, oncogenes, e6, and, e7, are, thought, to, modify, the, cell, cycle, so, as, to, retain, the, differentiating, host, keratinocyte, in, a, state, that, is, favourable, to, the, amplification, of, viral, genome, replication, and, consequent, late, gene, expression, e6, in, association, with, host, e6, associated, protein, which, has, ubiquitin, ligase, activity, acts, to, ubiquitinate, p53, leading, to, its, proteosomal, degradation, e7, in, oncogenic, hpvs, acts, as, the, primary, transforming, protein, e7, competes, for, retinoblastoma, protein, prb, binding, freeing, the, transcription, factor, e2f, to, transactivate, its, targets, thus, pushing, the, cell, cycle, forward, all, hpv, can, induce, transient, proliferation, but, only, strains, 16, and, 18, can, immortalize, cell, lines, in, vitro, it, has, also, been, shown, that, hpv, 16, and, 18, cannot, immortalize, primary, rat, cells, alone, there, needs, to, be, activation, of, the, ras, oncogene, in, the, upper, layers, of, the, host, epithelium, the, late, genes, l1, and, l2, are, transcribed, translated, and, serve, as, structural, proteins, that, encapsidate, the, amplified, viral, genomes, once, the, genome, is, encapsidated, the, capsid, appears, to, undergo, a, redox, dependent, assembly, maturation, event, which, is, tied, to, a, natural, redox, gradient, that, spans, both, suprabasal, and, cornified, epithelial, tissue, layers, this, assembly, maturation, event, stabilizes, virions, and, increases, their, specific, infectivity, virions, can, then, be, sloughed, off, in, the, dead, squames, of, the, host, epithelium, and, the, viral, lifecycle, continues, a, 2010, study, has, found, that, e6, and, e7, are, involved, in, beta, catenin, nuclear, accumulation, and, activation, of, wnt, signaling, in, hpv, induced, cancers, once, an, hpv, virion, invades, a, cell, an, active, infection, occurs, and, the, virus, can, be, transmitted, several, months, to, years, may, elapse, before, squamous, intraepithelial, lesions, sil, develop, and, can, be, clinically, detected, the, time, from, active, infection, to, clinically, detectable, disease, may, make, it, difficult, for, epidemiologists, to, establish, which, partner, was, the, source, of, infection, most, hpv, infections, are, cleared, up, by, most, people, without, medical, action, or, consequences, the, table, provides, data, for, high, risk, types, i, e, the, types, found, in, cancers, clearing, an, infection, does, not, always, create, immunity, if, there, is, a, new, or, continuing, source, of, infection, hernandez, 2005, 6, study, of, 25, couples, reports, a, number, of, instances, indicated, apparent, reinfection, after, viral, clearance, over, 200, types, of, hpv, have, been, identified, and, they, are, designated, by, numbers, they, may, be, divided, into, low, risk, and, high, risk, types, low, risk, types, cause, warts, and, high, risk, types, can, cause, lesions, or, cancer, guidelines, from, the, american, cancer, society, recommend, different, screening, strategies, for, cervical, cancer, based, on, a, woman, s, age, screening, history, risk, factors, and, choice, of, tests, because, of, the, link, between, hpv, and, cervical, cancer, the, acs, currently, recommends, early, detection, of, cervical, cancer, in, average, risk, asymptomatic, adults, primarily, with, cervical, cytology, by, pap, smear, regardless, of, hpv, vaccination, status, women, aged, 30, 65, should, preferably, be, tested, every, 5, years, with, both, the, hpv, test, and, the, pap, test, in, other, age, groups, a, pap, test, alone, can, suffice, unless, they, have, been, diagnosed, with, atypical, squamous, cells, of, undetermined, significance, asc, us, co, testing, with, a, pap, test, and, hpv, test, is, recommended, because, it, decreases, the, rate, of, false, negatives, according, to, the, national, cancer, institute, the, most, common, test, detects, dna, from, several, high, risk, hpv, types, but, it, cannot, identify, the, types, that, are, present, another, test, is, specific, for, dna, from, hpv, types, 16, and, 18, the, two, types, that, cause, most, hpv, associated, cancers, a, third, test, can, detect, dna, from, several, high, risk, hpv, types, and, can, indicate, whether, hpv, 16, or, hpv, 18, is, present, a, fourth, test, detects, rna, from, the, most, common, high, risk, hpv, types, these, tests, can, detect, hpv, infections, before, cell, abnormalities, are, evident, theoretically, the, hpv, dna, and, rna, tests, could, be, used, to, identify, hpv, infections, in, cells, taken, from, any, part, of, the, body, however, the, tests, are, approved, by, the, fda, for, only, two, indications, for, follow, up, testing, of, women, who, seem, to, have, abnormal, pap, test, results, and, for, cervical, cancer, screening, in, combination, with, a, pap, test, among, women, over, age, 30, guidelines, for, oropharyngeal, cancer, screening, by, the, preventive, services, task, force, and, american, dental, association, in, the, u, s, suggest, conventional, visual, examination, but, because, some, parts, of, the, oropharynx, are, hard, to, see, this, cancer, is, often, only, detected, in, later, stages, the, diagnosis, of, oropharyngeal, cancer, occurs, by, biopsy, of, exfoliated, cells, or, tissues, the, national, comprehensive, cancer, network, and, college, of, american, pathologists, recommend, testing, for, hpv, in, oropharyngeal, cancer, however, while, testing, is, recommended, there, is, no, specific, type, of, test, used, to, detect, hpv, from, oral, tumors, that, is, currently, recommended, by, the, fda, in, the, united, states, because, hpv, type, 16, is, the, most, common, type, found, in, oropharyngeal, cancer, p16, immunohistochemistry, is, one, test, option, used, to, determine, if, hpv, is, present, which, can, help, determine, course, of, treatment, since, tumors, that, are, negative, for, p16, have, better, outcomes, another, option, that, has, emerged, as, a, reliable, option, is, hpv, dna, in, situ, hybridization, ish, which, allows, for, visualization, of, the, hpv, there, is, not, a, wide, range, of, tests, available, even, though, hpv, is, common, most, studies, of, hpv, used, tools, and, custom, analysis, not, available, to, the, general, public, clinicians, often, depend, on, the, vaccine, among, young, people, and, high, clearance, rates, see, clearance, subsection, in, virology, to, create, a, low, risk, of, disease, and, mortality, and, treat, the, cancers, when, they, appear, others, believe, that, reducing, hpv, infection, in, more, men, and, women, even, when, it, has, no, symptoms, is, important, herd, immunity, to, prevent, more, cancers, rather, than, just, treating, them, where, tests, are, used, negative, test, results, show, safety, from, transmission, and, positive, test, results, show, where, shielding, condoms, gloves, is, needed, to, prevent, transmission, until, the, infection, clears, studies, have, tested, for, and, found, hpv, in, men, including, high, risk, types, i, e, the, types, found, in, cancers, on, fingers, mouth, saliva, anus, urethra, urine, semen, blood, scrotum, and, penis, the, aforementioned, qiagen, digene, kit, was, successfully, used, off, label, to, test, the, penis, scrotum, and, anus, of, men, in, long, term, relationships, with, women, who, were, positive, for, high, risk, hpv, of, these, men, 60, were, found, to, carry, the, virus, primarily, on, the, penis, similar, studies, have, been, conducted, on, women, using, cytobrushes, an, endocervical, brush, for, sampling, the, cervix, in, females, and, custom, analysis, in, one, study, researchers, sampled, subjects, urethra, scrotum, and, penis, samples, taken, from, the, urethra, added, less, than, 1, to, the, hpv, rate, studies, like, this, led, giuliano, to, recommend, sampling, the, glans, shaft, and, crease, between, them, along, with, the, scrotum, since, sampling, the, urethra, or, anus, added, very, little, to, the, diagnosis, dunne, recommends, the, glans, shaft, their, crease, and, the, foreskin, in, one, study, the, subjects, were, asked, not, to, wash, their, genitals, for, 12, hours, before, sampling, including, the, urethra, as, well, as, the, scrotum, and, the, penis, other, studies, are, silent, on, washing, a, particular, gap, in, studies, of, the, hands, one, small, study, used, wet, cytobrushes, rather, than, wet, the, skin, it, found, a, higher, proportion, of, men, to, be, hpv, positive, when, the, skin, was, rubbed, with, a, 600, grit, emery, paper, before, being, swabbed, with, the, brush, rather, than, swabbed, with, no, preparation, it, s, unclear, whether, the, emery, paper, collected, the, virions, or, simply, loosened, them, for, the, swab, to, collect, studies, have, found, self, collection, with, emery, paper, and, dacron, swabs, as, effective, as, collection, done, by, a, clinician, and, sometimes, more, so, since, patients, were, more, willing, than, a, clinician, to, scrape, vigorously, women, had, similar, success, in, self, sampling, using, tampons, swabs, cytobrushes, and, lavage, several, studies, used, cytobrushes, to, sample, fingertips, and, under, fingernails, without, wetting, the, area, or, the, brush, other, studies, analyzed, urine, semen, and, blood, and, found, varying, amounts, of, hpv, but, there, is, not, a, publicly, available, test, for, those, yet, although, it, is, possible, to, test, for, hpv, dna, in, other, kinds, of, infections, there, are, no, fda, approved, tests, for, general, screening, in, the, united, states, or, tests, approved, by, the, canadian, government, since, the, testing, is, inconclusive, and, considered, medically, unnecessary, genital, warts, are, the, only, visible, sign, of, low, risk, genital, hpv, and, can, be, identified, with, a, visual, check, these, visible, growths, however, are, the, result, of, non, carcinogenic, hpv, types, five, percent, acetic, acid, vinegar, is, used, to, identify, both, warts, and, squamous, intraepithelial, neoplasia, sil, lesions, with, limited, success, by, causing, abnormal, tissue, to, appear, white, but, most, doctors, have, found, this, technique, helpful, only, in, moist, areas, such, as, the, female, genital, tract, at, this, time, hpv, tests, for, males, are, used, only, in, research, research, into, testing, for, hpv, by, antibody, presence, has, been, done, the, approach, is, looking, for, an, immune, response, in, blood, which, would, contain, antibodies, for, hpv, if, the, patient, is, hpv, positive, the, reliability, of, such, tests, has, not, been, proven, as, there, has, not, been, a, fda, approved, product, as, of, august, 2018, testing, by, blood, would, be, a, less, invasive, test, for, screening, purposes, the, hpv, vaccines, can, prevent, the, most, common, types, of, infection, to, be, effective, they, must, be, used, before, an, infection, occurs, and, are, therefore, recommended, between, the, ages, of, nine, and, thirteen, cervical, cancer, screening, such, as, with, the, papanicolaou, test, pap, or, looking, at, the, cervix, after, using, acetic, acid, can, detect, early, cancer, or, abnormal, cells, that, may, develop, into, cancer, this, allows, for, early, treatment, which, results, in, better, outcomes, screening, has, reduced, both, the, number, and, deaths, from, cervical, cancer, in, the, developed, world, warts, can, be, removed, by, freezing, three, vaccines, are, available, to, prevent, infection, by, some, hpv, types, gardasil, gardasil, 9, and, cervarix, all, three, protect, against, initial, infection, with, hpv, types, 16, and, 18, which, cause, most, of, the, hpv, associated, cancer, cases, gardasil, also, protects, against, hpv, types, 6, and, 11, which, cause, 90, of, genital, warts, gardasil, is, a, recombinant, quadrivalent, vaccine, whereas, cervarix, is, bivalent, and, is, prepared, from, virus, like, particles, vlp, of, the, l1, capsid, protein, gardasil, 9, is, nonavalent, having, the, potential, to, prevent, about, 90, of, cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and, anal, cancers, it, can, protect, for, hpv, types, 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and, 58, the, latter, five, cause, up, to, 20, of, cervical, cancers, which, were, not, previously, covered, the, vaccines, provide, little, benefit, to, women, already, infected, with, hpv, types, 16, and, 18, for, this, reason, the, vaccine, is, recommended, primarily, for, those, women, not, yet, having, been, exposed, to, hpv, during, sex, the, world, health, organization, position, paper, on, hpv, vaccination, clearly, outlines, appropriate, cost, effective, strategies, for, using, hpv, vaccine, in, public, sector, programs, there, is, high, certainty, evidence, that, hpv, vaccines, protect, against, precancerous, cervical, lesions, in, young, women, particularly, those, vaccinated, aged, 15, to, 26, hpv, vaccines, do, not, increase, the, risk, of, serious, adverse, events, longer, follow, up, is, needed, to, monitor, the, impact, of, hpv, vaccines, on, cervical, cancer, the, cdc, recommends, the, vaccines, be, delivered, in, two, shots, at, an, interval, of, least, 6, months, for, those, aged, 11, 12, and, three, doses, for, those, 13, and, older, in, most, countries, they, are, funded, only, for, female, use, but, are, approved, for, male, use, in, many, countries, and, funded, for, teenage, boys, in, australia, the, vaccine, does, not, have, any, therapeutic, effect, on, existing, hpv, infections, or, cervical, lesions, in, 2010, 49, of, teenage, girls, in, the, us, got, the, hpv, vaccine, following, studies, suggesting, that, the, vaccine, is, more, effective, in, younger, girls, than, in, older, teenagers, the, united, kingdom, switzerland, mexico, the, netherlands, and, quebec, began, offering, the, vaccine, in, a, two, dose, schedule, for, girls, aged, under, 15, in, 2014, cervical, cancer, screening, recommendations, have, not, changed, for, females, who, receive, hpv, vaccine, it, remains, a, recommendation, that, women, continue, cervical, screening, such, as, pap, smear, testing, even, after, receiving, the, vaccine, since, it, does, not, prevent, all, types, of, cervical, cancer, both, men, and, women, are, carriers, of, hpv, the, gardasil, vaccine, also, protects, men, against, anal, cancers, and, warts, and, genital, warts, duration, of, both, vaccines, efficacy, has, been, observed, since, they, were, first, developed, and, is, expected, to, be, longlasting, in, december, 2014, the, fda, approved, a, nine, valent, gardasil, based, vaccine, gardasil, 9, to, protect, against, infection, with, the, four, strains, of, hpv, covered, by, the, first, generation, of, gardasil, as, well, as, five, other, strains, responsible, for, 20, of, cervical, cancers, hpv, 31, hpv, 33, hpv, 45, hpv, 52, and, hpv, 58, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, says, that, male, condom, use, may, reduce, the, risk, for, genital, human, papillomavirus, hpv, infection, but, provides, a, lesser, degree, of, protection, compared, with, other, sexual, transmitted, infections, because, hpv, also, may, be, transmitted, by, exposure, to, areas, e, g, infected, skin, or, mucosal, surfaces, that, are, not, covered, or, protected, by, the, condom, the, virus, is, unusually, hardy, and, is, immune, to, most, common, disinfectants, it, is, the, first, virus, ever, shown, to, be, resistant, to, inactivation, by, glutaraldehyde, which, is, among, the, most, common, strong, disinfectants, used, in, hospitals, diluted, sodium, hypochlorite, bleach, is, effective, but, cannot, be, used, on, some, types, of, re, usable, equipment, such, as, ultrasound, transducers, as, a, result, of, these, difficulties, there, is, developing, concern, about, the, possibility, of, transmitting, the, virus, on, healthcare, equipment, particularly, reusable, gynecological, equipment, that, cannot, be, autoclaved, for, such, equipment, some, health, authorities, encourage, use, of, uv, disinfection, or, a, non, hypochlorite, oxidizing, based, high, level, disinfectant, with, label, claims, for, non, enveloped, viruses, such, as, a, strong, hydrogen, peroxide, solution, or, chlorine, dioxide, wipes, such, disinfection, methods, are, expected, to, be, relatively, effective, against, hpv, there, is, currently, no, specific, treatment, for, hpv, infection, however, the, viral, infection, is, usually, cleared, to, undetectable, levels, by, the, immune, system, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, the, body, s, immune, system, clears, hpv, naturally, within, two, years, for, 90, of, cases, see, clearance, subsection, in, virology, for, more, detail, however, experts, do, not, agree, on, whether, the, virus, is, eliminated, or, reduced, to, undetectable, levels, and, it, is, difficult, to, know, when, it, is, contagious, follow, up, care, is, usually, recommended, and, practiced, by, many, health, clinics, follow, up, is, sometimes, not, successful, because, a, portion, of, those, treated, do, not, return, to, be, evaluated, in, addition, to, the, normal, methods, of, phone, calls, and, mail, text, messaging, and, email, can, improve, the, number, of, people, who, return, for, care, as, of, 2015, it, is, unclear, the, best, method, of, follow, up, following, treatment, of, cervical, intraepithelial, neoplasia, globally, 12, of, women, are, positive, for, hpv, dna, with, rates, varying, by, age, and, country, the, highest, rates, of, hpv, are, in, younger, women, with, a, rate, of, 24, in, women, under, 25, years, rates, decline, in, older, age, groups, in, europe, and, the, americas, but, less, so, in, africa, and, asia, the, rates, are, highest, in, sub, saharan, africa, 24, and, eastern, europe, 21, and, lowest, in, north, america, 5, and, western, asia, 2, the, most, common, types, of, hpv, worldwide, are, hpv16, 3, 2, hpv18, 1, 4, hpv52, 0, 9, hpv31, 0, 8, and, hpv58, 0, 7, high, risk, types, of, hpv, are, also, distributed, unevenly, with, hpv16, having, a, rate, around, 13, in, africa, and, 30, in, west, and, central, asia, like, many, diseases, hpv, disproportionately, affects, low, income, and, resource, poor, countries, the, higher, rates, of, hpv, in, sub, saharan, africa, for, example, may, be, related, to, high, exposure, to, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, in, the, region, other, factors, that, impact, the, global, spread, of, disease, are, sexual, behaviors, including, age, of, sexual, debut, number, of, sexual, partners, and, ease, of, access, to, barrier, contraception, all, of, which, vary, globally, hpv, is, estimated, to, be, the, most, common, sexually, transmitted, infection, in, the, united, states, most, sexually, active, men, and, women, will, probably, acquire, genital, hpv, infection, at, some, point, in, their, lives, the, american, social, health, association, estimates, that, about, 75, 80, of, sexually, active, americans, will, be, infected, with, hpv, at, some, point, in, their, lifetime, by, the, age, of, 50, more, than, 80, of, american, women, will, have, contracted, at, least, one, strain, of, genital, hpv, it, was, estimated, that, in, the, year, 2000, there, were, approximately, 6, 2, million, new, hpv, infections, among, americans, aged, 15, 44, of, these, an, estimated, 74, occurred, to, people, between, ages, of, 15, and, 24, of, the, stis, studied, genital, hpv, was, the, most, commonly, acquired, in, the, united, states, it, is, estimated, that, 10, of, the, population, has, an, active, hpv, infection, 4, has, an, infection, that, has, caused, cytological, abnormalities, and, an, additional, 1, has, an, infection, causing, genital, warts, estimates, of, hpv, prevalence, vary, from, 14, to, more, than, 90, one, reason, for, the, difference, is, that, some, studies, report, women, who, currently, have, a, detectable, infection, while, other, studies, report, women, who, have, ever, had, a, detectable, infection, another, cause, of, discrepancy, is, the, difference, in, strains, that, were, tested, for, one, study, found, that, during, 2003, 2004, at, any, given, time, 26, 8, of, women, aged, 14, to, 59, were, infected, with, at, least, one, type, of, hpv, this, was, higher, than, previous, estimates, 15, 2, were, infected, with, one, or, more, of, the, high, risk, types, that, can, cause, cancer, the, prevalence, for, high, risk, and, low, risk, types, is, roughly, similar, over, time, human, papillomavirus, is, not, included, among, the, diseases, that, are, typically, reportable, to, the, cdc, as, of, 2011, on, average, 538, cases, of, hpv, associated, cancers, were, diagnosed, per, year, in, ireland, during, the, period, 2010, to, 2014, cervical, cancer, was, the, most, frequent, hpv, associated, cancer, with, on, average, 292, cases, per, year, 74, of, the, female, total, and, 54, of, the, overall, total, of, hpv, associated, cancers, a, study, of, 996, cervical, cytology, samples, in, an, irish, urban, female, opportunistically, screened, population, found, an, overall, hpv, prevalence, of, 19, 8, hpv, 16, at, 20, and, hpv, 18, at, 12, were, the, commonest, high, risk, types, detected, in, europe, types, 16, and, 18, are, responsible, for, over, 70, of, cervical, cancers, overall, rates, of, hpv, associated, invasive, cancers, may, be, increasing, between, 1994, and, 2014, there, was, a, 2, increase, in, the, rate, of, hpv, associated, invasive, cancers, per, year, for, both, sexes, in, ireland, as, hpv, is, known, to, be, associated, with, ano, genital, warts, these, are, notifiable, to, the, health, protection, surveillance, centre, hpsc, genital, warts, are, the, second, most, common, sti, in, ireland, there, were, 1, 281, cases, of, ano, genital, warts, notified, in, 2017, which, was, a, decrease, on, the, 2016, figure, of, 1, 593, the, highest, age, specific, rate, for, both, male, and, female, was, in, the, 25, 29, year, old, age, range, 53, of, cases, were, among, males, in, sri, lanka, the, prevalence, of, hpv, is, 15, 5, regardless, of, their, cytological, abnormalities, in, the, autonomous, region, of, inner, mongolia, overall, hpv, prevalence, is, 14, 5, but, shows, substantial, ethnical, disparity, the, prevalence, in, mongolian, women, 14, 9, being, much, higher, than, that, of, han, participants, 4, 3, urbanization, the, number, of, sex, partners, and, pap, history, appear, as, risk, factors, for, hpv, infection, in, han, but, not, in, mongolian, women, the, region, is, thus, an, important, example, that, epidemiology, of, hpv, is, more, related, to, cultural, and, ethnical, factors, and, not, to, geography, per, se, in, 1972, the, association, of, the, human, papillomaviruses, with, skin, cancer, in, epidermodysplasia, verruciformis, was, proposed, by, stefania, jab, o, ska, in, poland, in, 1976, harald, zur, hausen, published, the, hypothesis, that, human, papilloma, virus, plays, an, important, role, in, the, cause, of, cervical, cancer, in, 1978, jab, o, ska, and, gerard, orth, at, the, pasteur, institute, discovered, hpv, 5, in, skin, cancer, in, 1983, and, 1984, zur, hausen, and, his, collaborators, identified, hpv16, and, hpv18, in, cervical, cancer, the, hela, cell, line, contains, extra, dna, in, its, genome, that, originated, from, hpv, type, 18, the, ludwig, mcgill, hpv, cohort, is, one, of, the, world, s, largest, longitudinal, studies, of, the, natural, history, of, human, papillomavirus, hpv, infection, and, cervical, cancer, risk, it, was, established, in, 1993, by, ludwig, cancer, research, and, mcgill, university, in, montreal, canada
