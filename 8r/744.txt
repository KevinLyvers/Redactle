former, range, the, jaguar, panthera, onca, is, a, large, cat, species, and, the, only, living, member, of, the, genus, panthera, native, to, the, americas, with, a, body, length, of, up, to, 1, 85, m, 6, ft, 1, in, and, a, weight, of, up, to, 158, kg, 348, lb, it, is, the, biggest, cat, species, in, the, americas, and, the, third, largest, in, the, world, its, distinctively, marked, coat, features, pale, yellow, to, tan, colored, fur, covered, by, spots, that, transition, to, rosettes, on, the, sides, although, a, melanistic, black, coat, appears, in, some, individuals, the, jaguar, s, powerful, bite, allows, it, to, pierce, the, carapaces, of, turtles, and, tortoises, and, to, employ, an, unusual, killing, method, it, bites, directly, through, the, skull, of, mammalian, prey, between, the, ears, to, deliver, a, fatal, blow, to, the, brain, the, modern, jaguar, s, ancestors, probably, entered, the, americas, from, eurasia, during, the, early, pleistocene, via, the, land, bridge, that, once, spanned, the, bering, strait, today, the, jaguar, s, range, extends, from, the, southwestern, united, states, across, mexico, and, much, of, central, america, the, amazon, rainforest, and, south, to, paraguay, and, northern, argentina, it, inhabits, a, variety, of, forested, and, open, terrains, but, its, preferred, habitat, is, tropical, and, subtropical, moist, broadleaf, forest, wetlands, and, wooded, regions, it, is, adept, at, swimming, and, is, largely, a, solitary, opportunistic, stalk, and, ambush, apex, predator, as, a, keystone, species, it, plays, an, important, role, in, stabilizing, ecosystems, and, in, regulating, prey, populations, the, jaguar, is, threatened, by, habitat, loss, habitat, fragmentation, poaching, for, trade, with, its, body, parts, and, killings, in, human, wildlife, conflict, situations, particularly, with, ranchers, in, central, and, south, america, it, has, been, listed, as, near, threatened, on, the, iucn, red, list, since, 2002, the, wild, population, is, thought, to, have, declined, since, the, late, 1990s, priority, areas, for, jaguar, conservation, comprise, 51, jaguar, conservation, units, jcus, defined, as, large, areas, inhabited, by, at, least, 50, breeding, jaguars, the, jcus, are, located, in, 36, geographic, regions, ranging, from, mexico, to, argentina, the, jaguar, has, featured, prominently, in, the, mythology, of, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, including, those, of, the, aztec, and, maya, civilizations, the, word, jaguar, is, possibly, derived, from, the, tupi, guarani, word, yaguara, meaning, wild, beast, that, overcomes, its, prey, at, a, bound, in, north, america, the, word, is, pronounced, disyllabic, d, w, r, while, in, british, english, it, is, pronounced, with, three, syllables, d, ju, r, because, that, word, also, applies, to, other, animals, indigenous, peoples, in, guyana, call, it, jaguaret, with, the, added, sufix, et, meaning, true, beast, onca, is, derived, from, the, portuguese, name, on, a, for, a, spotted, cat, that, is, larger, than, a, lynx, cf, ounce, the, word, panther, is, derived, from, classical, latin, panth, ra, itself, from, the, ancient, greek, p, nth, r, in, 1758, carl, linnaeus, described, the, jaguar, in, his, work, systema, naturae, and, gave, it, the, scientific, name, felis, onca, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, several, jaguar, type, specimens, formed, the, basis, for, descriptions, of, subspecies, in, 1939, reginald, innes, pocock, recognized, eight, subspecies, based, on, the, geographic, origins, and, skull, morphology, of, these, specimens, pocock, did, not, have, access, to, sufficient, zoological, specimens, to, critically, evaluate, their, subspecific, status, but, expressed, doubt, about, the, status, of, several, later, consideration, of, his, work, suggested, only, three, subspecies, should, be, recognized, the, description, of, p, o, palustris, was, based, on, a, fossil, skull, by, 2005, nine, subspecies, were, considered, to, be, valid, taxa, reginald, innes, pocock, placed, the, jaguar, in, the, genus, panthera, and, observed, that, it, shares, several, morphological, features, with, the, leopard, p, pardus, he, therefore, concluded, that, they, are, most, closely, related, to, each, other, results, of, morphological, and, genetic, research, indicate, a, clinal, north, south, variation, between, populations, but, no, evidence, for, subspecific, differentiation, dna, analysis, of, 84, jaguar, samples, from, south, america, revealed, that, the, gene, flow, between, jaguar, populations, in, colombia, was, high, in, the, past, since, 2017, the, jaguar, is, considered, to, be, a, monotypic, taxon, though, the, modern, panthera, onca, onca, is, still, distinguished, from, two, fossil, subspecies, panthera, onca, augusta, and, panthera, onca, mesembrina, however, the, 2024, study, suggested, that, the, validity, of, subspecific, assignments, on, both, p, o, augusta, and, p, o, mesembrina, remains, unresolved, since, both, fossil, and, living, jaguars, show, a, considerable, variation, in, morphometry, the, panthera, lineage, is, estimated, to, have, genetically, diverged, from, the, common, ancestor, of, the, felidae, around, 9, 32, to, 4, 47, million, years, ago, to, 11, 75, to, 0, 97, million, years, ago, some, genetic, analyzes, place, the, jaguar, as, a, sister, species, to, the, lion, with, which, it, diverged, 3, 46, to, 1, 22, million, years, ago, but, other, studies, place, the, lion, closer, to, the, leopard, the, lineage, of, the, jaguar, appears, to, have, originated, in, africa, and, spread, to, eurasia, 1, 95, 1, 77, mya, the, living, jaguar, species, is, often, suggested, to, have, descended, from, the, eurasian, panthera, gombaszoegensis, the, ancestor, of, the, jaguar, entered, the, american, continent, via, beringia, the, land, bridge, that, once, spanned, the, bering, strait, some, authors, have, disputed, the, close, relationship, between, p, gombaszoegensis, which, is, primarily, known, from, europe, and, the, modern, jaguar, the, oldest, fossils, of, modern, jaguars, p, onca, have, been, found, in, north, america, dating, between, 850, 000, 820, 000, years, ago, results, of, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, of, 37, jaguars, indicate, that, current, populations, evolved, between, 510, 000, and, 280, 000, years, ago, in, northern, south, america, and, subsequently, recolonized, north, and, central, america, after, the, extinction, of, jaguars, there, during, the, late, pleistocene, two, extinct, subspecies, of, jaguar, are, recognized, in, the, fossil, record, the, north, american, p, o, augusta, and, south, american, p, o, mesembrina, felinae, lion, p, leo, jaguar, leopard, p, pardus, tiger, p, tigris, snow, leopard, p, uncia, neofelis, felinae, lion, leopard, snow, leopard, jaguar, tiger, neofelis, the, jaguar, is, a, compact, and, muscular, animal, it, is, the, largest, cat, native, to, the, americas, and, the, third, largest, in, the, world, exceeded, in, size, only, by, the, tiger, and, the, lion, it, stands, 57, to, 81, cm, 22, 4, to, 31, 9, in, tall, at, the, shoulders, its, size, and, weight, vary, considerably, depending, on, sex, and, region, weights, in, most, regions, are, normally, in, the, range, of, 56, 96, kg, 123, 212, lb, exceptionally, big, males, have, been, recorded, to, weigh, as, much, as, 158, kg, 348, lb, the, smallest, females, from, middle, america, weigh, about, 36, kg, 79, lb, it, is, sexually, dimorphic, with, females, typically, being, 10, 20, smaller, than, males, the, length, from, the, nose, to, the, base, of, the, tail, varies, from, 1, 12, to, 1, 85, m, 3, ft, 8, in, to, 6, ft, 1, in, the, tail, is, 45, to, 75, cm, 18, to, 30, in, long, and, the, shortest, of, any, big, cat, its, muscular, legs, are, shorter, than, the, legs, of, other, panthera, species, with, similar, body, weight, size, tends, to, increase, from, north, to, south, jaguars, in, the, chamela, cuixmala, biosphere, reserve, on, the, pacific, coast, of, central, mexico, weighed, around, 50, kg, 110, lb, jaguars, in, venezuela, and, brazil, are, much, larger, with, average, weights, of, about, 95, kg, 209, lb, in, males, and, of, about, 56, 78, kg, 123, 172, lb, in, females, the, jaguar, s, coat, ranges, from, pale, yellow, to, tan, or, reddish, yellow, with, a, whitish, underside, and, covered, in, black, spots, the, spots, and, their, shapes, vary, on, the, sides, they, become, rosettes, which, may, include, one, or, several, dots, the, spots, on, the, head, and, neck, are, generally, solid, as, are, those, on, the, tail, where, they, may, merge, to, form, bands, near, the, end, and, create, a, black, tip, they, are, elongated, on, the, middle, of, the, back, often, connecting, to, create, a, median, stripe, and, blotchy, on, the, belly, these, patterns, serve, as, camouflage, in, areas, with, dense, vegetation, and, patchy, shadows, jaguars, living, in, forests, are, often, darker, and, considerably, smaller, than, those, living, in, open, areas, possibly, due, to, the, smaller, numbers, of, large, herbivorous, prey, in, forest, areas, the, jaguar, closely, resembles, the, leopard, but, is, generally, more, robust, with, stockier, limbs, and, a, more, square, head, the, rosettes, on, a, jaguar, s, coat, are, larger, darker, fewer, in, number, and, have, thicker, lines, with, a, small, spot, in, the, middle, it, has, powerful, jaws, with, the, third, highest, bite, force, of, all, felids, after, the, tiger, and, the, lion, it, has, an, average, bite, force, at, the, canine, tip, of, 887, 0, newton, and, a, bite, force, quotient, at, the, canine, tip, of, 118, 6, a, 100, kg, 220, lb, jaguar, can, bite, with, a, force, of, 4, 939, kn, 1, 110, lbf, with, the, canine, teeth, and, 6, 922, kn, 1, 556, lbf, at, the, carnassial, notch, melanistic, jaguars, are, also, known, as, black, panthers, the, black, morph, is, less, common, than, the, spotted, one, black, jaguars, have, been, documented, in, central, and, south, america, melanism, in, the, jaguar, is, caused, by, deletions, in, the, melanocortin, 1, receptor, gene, and, inherited, through, a, dominant, allele, black, jaguars, occur, at, higher, densities, in, tropical, rainforest, and, are, more, active, during, the, daytime, this, suggests, that, melanism, provides, camouflage, in, dense, vegetation, with, high, illumination, in, 2004, a, camera, trap, in, the, sierra, madre, occidental, mountains, photographed, the, first, documented, black, jaguar, in, northern, mexico, black, jaguars, were, also, photographed, in, costa, rica, s, alberto, manuel, brenes, biological, reserve, in, the, mountains, of, the, cordillera, de, talamanca, in, barbilla, national, park, and, in, eastern, panama, in, 1999, the, jaguar, s, historic, range, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, was, estimated, at, 19, 000, 000, km, 2, 7, 300, 000, sq, mi, stretching, from, the, southern, united, states, through, central, america, to, southern, argentina, by, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, its, global, range, had, decreased, to, about, 8, 750, 000, km, 2, 3, 380, 000, sq, mi, with, most, declines, occurring, in, the, southern, united, states, northern, mexico, northern, brazil, and, southern, argentina, its, present, range, extends, from, mexico, through, central, america, to, south, america, comprising, belize, guatemala, honduras, nicaragua, costa, rica, particularly, on, the, osa, peninsula, panama, colombia, venezuela, guyana, suriname, french, guiana, ecuador, peru, bolivia, brazil, paraguay, and, argentina, it, is, considered, to, be, locally, extinct, in, el, salvador, and, uruguay, jaguars, have, been, occasionally, sighted, in, arizona, new, mexico, and, texas, with, 62, accounts, reported, in, the, 20th, century, between, 2012, and, 2015, a, male, vagrant, jaguar, was, recorded, in, 23, locations, in, the, santa, rita, mountains, eight, jaguars, were, photographed, in, the, southwestern, us, between, 1996, and, 2024, the, jaguar, prefers, dense, forest, and, typically, inhabits, dry, deciduous, forests, tropical, and, subtropical, moist, broadleaf, forests, rainforests, and, cloud, forests, in, central, and, south, america, open, seasonally, flooded, wetlands, dry, grassland, and, historically, also, oak, forests, in, the, united, states, it, has, been, recorded, at, elevations, up, to, 3, 800, m, 12, 500, ft, but, avoids, montane, forests, it, favors, riverine, habitat, and, swamps, with, dense, vegetation, cover, in, the, mayan, forests, of, mexico, and, guatemala, 11, gps, collared, jaguars, preferred, undisturbed, dense, habitat, away, from, roads, females, avoided, even, areas, with, low, levels, of, human, activity, whereas, males, appeared, less, disturbed, by, human, population, density, a, young, male, jaguar, was, also, recorded, in, the, semi, arid, sierra, de, san, carlos, at, a, waterhole, in, the, 19th, century, the, jaguar, was, still, sighted, at, the, north, platte, river, 48, 80, km, 30, 50, mi, north, of, longs, peak, in, colorado, in, coastal, louisiana, northern, arizona, and, new, mexico, multiple, verified, zoological, reports, of, the, jaguar, are, known, in, california, two, as, far, north, as, monterey, in, 1814, and, 1826, the, only, record, of, an, active, jaguar, den, with, breeding, adults, and, kittens, in, the, united, states, was, in, the, tehachapi, mountains, of, california, prior, to, 1860, the, jaguar, persisted, in, california, until, about, 1860, the, last, confirmed, jaguar, in, texas, was, shot, in, 1948, 4, 8, km, 3, mi, southeast, of, kingsville, texas, in, arizona, a, female, was, shot, in, the, white, mountains, in, 1963, by, the, late, 1960s, the, jaguar, was, thought, to, have, been, extirpated, in, the, united, states, arizona, outlawed, jaguar, hunting, in, 1969, but, by, then, no, females, remained, and, over, the, next, 25, years, only, two, males, were, sighted, and, killed, in, the, state, in, 1996, a, rancher, and, hunting, guide, from, douglas, arizona, came, across, a, jaguar, in, the, peloncillo, mountains, and, became, a, researcher, on, jaguars, placing, trail, cameras, which, recorded, four, more, jaguars, the, jaguar, is, mostly, active, at, night, and, during, twilight, however, jaguars, living, in, densely, forested, regions, of, the, amazon, rainforest, and, the, pantanal, are, largely, active, by, day, whereas, jaguars, in, the, atlantic, forest, are, primarily, active, by, night, the, activity, pattern, of, the, jaguar, coincides, with, the, activity, of, its, main, prey, species, jaguars, are, good, swimmers, and, play, and, hunt, in, the, water, possibly, more, than, tigers, they, have, been, recorded, moving, between, islands, and, the, shore, jaguars, are, also, good, at, climbing, trees, but, do, so, less, often, than, cougars, the, adult, jaguar, is, an, apex, predator, meaning, it, is, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, and, is, not, preyed, upon, in, the, wild, the, jaguar, has, also, been, termed, a, keystone, species, as, it, is, assumed, that, it, controls, the, population, levels, of, prey, such, as, herbivorous, and, seed, eating, mammals, and, thus, maintains, the, structural, integrity, of, forest, systems, however, field, work, has, shown, this, may, be, natural, variability, and, the, population, increases, may, not, be, sustained, thus, the, keystone, predator, hypothesis, is, not, accepted, by, all, scientists, the, jaguar, is, sympatric, with, the, cougar, in, central, mexico, both, prey, on, white, tailed, deer, which, makes, up, 54, and, 66, of, jaguar, and, cougar, s, prey, respectively, in, northern, mexico, the, jaguar, and, the, cougar, share, the, same, habitat, and, their, diet, overlaps, dependent, on, prey, availability, jaguars, seemed, to, prefer, deer, and, calves, in, mexico, and, central, america, neither, of, the, two, cats, are, considered, to, be, the, dominant, predator, in, south, america, the, jaguar, is, larger, than, the, cougar, and, tends, to, take, larger, prey, usually, over, 22, kg, 49, lb, the, cougar, s, prey, usually, weighs, between, 2, and, 22, kg, 4, and, 49, lb, which, is, thought, to, be, the, reason, for, its, smaller, size, this, situation, may, be, advantageous, to, the, cougar, its, broader, prey, niche, including, its, ability, to, take, smaller, prey, may, give, it, an, advantage, over, the, jaguar, in, human, altered, landscapes, the, jaguar, is, an, obligate, carnivore, and, depends, solely, on, flesh, for, its, nutrient, requirements, an, analysis, of, 53, studies, documenting, the, diet, of, the, jaguar, revealed, that, its, prey, ranges, in, weight, from, 1, to, 130, kg, 2, 2, to, 286, 6, lb, it, prefers, prey, weighing, 45, 85, kg, 99, 187, lb, with, the, capybara, and, the, giant, anteater, being, the, most, selected, when, available, it, also, preys, on, marsh, deer, southern, tamandua, collared, peccary, and, black, agouti, in, floodplains, jaguars, opportunistically, take, reptiles, such, as, turtles, and, caimans, consumption, of, reptiles, appears, to, be, more, frequent, in, jaguars, than, in, other, big, cats, one, remote, population, in, the, brazilian, pantanal, is, recorded, to, primarily, feed, on, aquatic, reptiles, and, fish, the, jaguar, also, preys, on, livestock, in, cattle, ranching, areas, where, wild, prey, is, scarce, the, daily, food, requirement, of, a, captive, jaguar, weighing, 34, kg, 75, lb, was, estimated, at, 1, 4, kg, 3, 1, lb, of, meat, the, jaguar, s, bite, force, allows, it, to, pierce, the, carapaces, of, the, yellow, spotted, amazon, river, turtle, and, the, yellow, footed, tortoise, it, employs, an, unusual, killing, method, it, bites, mammalian, prey, directly, through, the, skull, between, the, ears, to, deliver, a, fatal, bite, to, the, brain, it, kills, capybara, by, piercing, its, canine, teeth, through, the, temporal, bones, of, its, skull, breaking, its, zygomatic, arch, and, mandible, and, penetrating, its, brain, often, through, the, ears, it, has, been, hypothesized, to, be, an, adaptation, to, cracking, open, turtle, shells, armored, reptiles, may, have, formed, an, abundant, prey, base, for, the, jaguar, following, the, late, pleistocene, extinctions, however, this, is, disputed, as, even, in, areas, where, jaguars, prey, on, reptiles, they, are, still, taken, relatively, infrequently, compared, to, mammals, in, spite, of, their, greater, abundance, between, october, 2001, and, april, 2004, 10, jaguars, were, monitored, in, the, southern, pantanal, in, the, dry, season, from, april, to, september, they, killed, prey, at, intervals, ranging, from, one, to, seven, days, and, ranging, from, one, to, 16, days, in, the, wet, season, from, october, to, march, the, jaguar, uses, a, stalk, and, ambush, strategy, when, hunting, rather, than, chasing, prey, the, cat, will, slowly, walk, down, forest, paths, listening, for, and, stalking, prey, before, rushing, or, ambushing, the, jaguar, attacks, from, cover, and, usually, from, a, target, s, blind, spot, with, a, quick, pounce, the, species, ambushing, abilities, are, considered, nearly, peerless, in, the, animal, kingdom, by, both, indigenous, people, and, field, researchers, and, are, probably, a, product, of, its, role, as, an, apex, predator, in, several, different, environments, the, ambush, may, include, leaping, into, water, after, prey, as, a, jaguar, is, quite, capable, of, carrying, a, large, kill, while, swimming, its, strength, is, such, that, carcasses, as, large, as, a, heifer, can, be, hauled, up, a, tree, to, avoid, flood, levels, after, killing, prey, the, jaguar, will, drag, the, carcass, to, a, thicket, or, other, secluded, spot, it, begins, eating, at, the, neck, and, chest, the, heart, and, lungs, are, consumed, followed, by, the, shoulders, the, jaguar, is, generally, solitary, except, for, females, with, cubs, in, 1977, groups, consisting, of, a, male, female, and, cubs, and, two, females, with, two, males, were, sighted, several, times, in, a, study, area, in, the, paraguay, river, valley, in, some, areas, males, may, form, paired, coalitions, which, together, mark, defend, and, invade, territories, find, and, mate, with, the, same, females, and, search, for, and, share, prey, a, radio, collared, female, moved, in, a, home, range, of, 25, 38, km, 2, 9, 7, 14, 7, sq, mi, which, partly, overlapped, with, another, female, the, home, range, of, the, male, in, this, study, area, overlapped, with, several, females, the, jaguar, uses, scrape, marks, urine, and, feces, to, mark, its, territory, the, size, of, home, ranges, depends, on, the, level, of, deforestation, and, human, population, density, the, home, ranges, of, females, vary, from, 15, 3, km, 2, 5, 9, sq, mi, in, the, pantanal, to, 53, 6, km, 2, 20, 7, sq, mi, in, the, amazon, to, 233, 5, km, 2, 90, 2, sq, mi, in, the, atlantic, forest, male, jaguar, home, ranges, vary, from, 25, km, 2, 9, 7, sq, mi, in, the, pantanal, to, 180, 3, km, 2, 69, 6, sq, mi, in, the, amazon, to, 591, 4, km, 2, 228, 3, sq, mi, in, the, atlantic, forest, and, 807, 4, km, 2, 311, 7, sq, mi, in, the, cerrado, studies, employing, gps, telemetry, in, 2003, and, 2004, found, densities, of, only, six, to, seven, jaguars, per, 100, km, 62, mi, in, the, pantanal, region, compared, with, 10, to, 11, using, traditional, methods, this, suggests, the, widely, used, sampling, methods, may, inflate, the, actual, numbers, of, individuals, in, a, sampling, area, fights, between, males, occur, but, are, rare, and, avoidance, behavior, has, been, observed, in, the, wild, in, one, wetland, population, with, degraded, territorial, boundaries, and, more, social, proximity, adults, of, the, same, sex, are, more, tolerant, of, each, other, and, engage, in, more, friendly, and, co, operative, interactions, the, jaguar, roars, grunts, for, long, distance, communication, intensive, bouts, of, counter, calling, between, individuals, have, been, observed, in, the, wild, this, vocalization, is, described, as, hoarse, with, five, or, six, guttural, notes, chuffing, is, produced, by, individuals, when, greeting, during, courting, or, by, a, mother, comforting, her, cubs, this, sound, is, described, as, low, intensity, snorts, possibly, intended, to, signal, tranquility, and, passivity, cubs, have, been, recorded, bleating, gurgling, and, mewing, in, captivity, the, female, jaguar, is, recorded, to, reach, sexual, maturity, at, the, age, of, about, 2, 5, years, estrus, lasts, 7, 15, days, with, an, estrus, cycle, of, 41, 8, to, 52, 6, days, during, estrus, she, exhibits, increased, restlessness, with, rolling, and, prolonged, vocalizations, she, is, an, induced, ovulator, but, can, also, ovulate, spontaneously, gestation, lasts, 91, to, 111, days, the, male, is, sexually, mature, at, the, age, of, three, to, four, years, his, mean, ejaculate, volume, is, 8, 6, 1, 3, ml, generation, length, of, the, jaguar, is, 9, 8, years, in, the, pantanal, breeding, pairs, were, observed, to, stay, together, for, up, to, five, days, females, had, one, to, two, cubs, the, young, are, born, with, closed, eyes, but, open, them, after, two, weeks, cubs, are, weaned, at, the, age, of, three, months, but, remain, in, the, birth, den, for, six, months, before, leaving, to, accompany, their, mother, on, hunts, jaguars, remain, with, their, mothers,

emas, national, park, dna, paternity, testing, of, blood, samples, revealed, that, the, male, was, the, father, of, the, cubs, two, more, cases, of, infanticide, were, documented, in, the, northern, pantanal, in, 2013, to, defend, against, infanticide, the, female, may, hide, her, cubs, and, distract, the, male, with, courtship, behavior, the, spanish, conquistadors, feared, the, jaguar, according, to, charles, darwin, the, indigenous, peoples, of, south, america, stated, that, people, did, not, need, to, fear, the, jaguar, as, long, as, capybaras, were, abundant, the, first, official, record, of, a, jaguar, killing, a, human, in, brazil, dates, to, june, 2008, two, children, were, attacked, by, jaguars, in, guyana, the, majority, of, known, attacks, on, people, happened, when, it, had, been, cornered, or, wounded, the, jaguar, is, threatened, by, loss, and, fragmentation, of, habitat, illegal, killing, in, retaliation, for, livestock, depredation, and, for, illegal, trade, in, jaguar, body, parts, it, is, listed, as, near, threatened, on, the, iucn, red, list, since, 2002, as, the, jaguar, population, has, probably, declined, by, 20, 25, since, the, mid, 1990s, deforestation, is, a, major, threat, to, the, jaguar, across, its, range, habitat, loss, was, most, rapid, in, drier, regions, such, as, the, argentine, pampas, the, arid, grasslands, of, mexico, and, the, southwestern, united, states, in, 2002, it, was, estimated, that, the, range, of, the, jaguar, had, declined, to, about, 46, of, its, range, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, 2018, it, was, estimated, that, its, range, had, declined, by, 55, in, the, last, century, the, only, remaining, stronghold, is, the, amazon, rainforest, a, region, that, is, rapidly, being, fragmented, by, deforestation, between, 2000, and, 2012, forest, loss, in, the, jaguar, range, amounted, to, 83, 759, km, 2, 32, 340, sq, mi, with, fragmentation, increasing, in, particular, in, corridors, between, jaguar, conservation, units, jcus, by, 2014, direct, linkages, between, two, jcus, in, bolivia, were, lost, and, two, jcus, in, northern, argentina, became, completely, isolated, due, to, deforestation, in, mexico, the, jaguar, is, primarily, threatened, by, poaching, its, habitat, is, fragmented, in, northern, mexico, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, the, yucat, n, peninsula, caused, by, changes, in, land, use, construction, of, roads, and, tourism, infrastructure, in, panama, 220, of, 230, jaguars, were, killed, in, retaliation, for, predation, on, livestock, between, 1998, and, 2014, in, venezuela, the, jaguar, was, extirpated, in, about, 26, of, its, range, in, the, country, since, 1940, mostly, in, dry, savannas, and, unproductive, scrubland, in, the, northeastern, region, of, anzo, tegui, in, ecuador, the, jaguar, is, threatened, by, reduced, prey, availability, in, areas, where, the, expansion, of, the, road, network, facilitated, access, of, human, hunters, to, forests, in, the, alto, paran, atlantic, forests, at, least, 117, jaguars, were, killed, in, igua, u, national, park, and, the, adjacent, misiones, province, between, 1995, and, 2008, some, afro, colombians, in, the, colombian, choc, department, hunt, jaguars, for, consumption, and, sale, of, meat, between, 2008, and, 2012, at, least, 15, jaguars, were, killed, by, livestock, farmers, in, central, belize, the, international, trade, of, jaguar, skins, boomed, between, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, and, the, early, 1970s, significant, declines, occurred, in, the, 1960s, as, more, than, 15, 000, jaguars, were, yearly, killed, for, their, skins, in, the, brazilian, amazon, alone, the, trade, in, jaguar, skins, decreased, since, 1973, when, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, was, enacted, interview, surveys, with, 533, people, in, the, northwestern, bolivian, amazon, revealed, that, local, people, killed, jaguars, out, of, fear, in, retaliation, and, for, trade, between, august, 2016, and, august, 2019, jaguar, skins, and, body, parts, were, seen, for, sale, in, tourist, markets, in, the, peruvian, cities, of, lima, iquitos, and, pucallpa, human, wildlife, conflict, opportunistic, hunting, and, hunting, for, trade, in, domestic, markets, are, key, drivers, for, killing, jaguars, in, belize, and, guatemala, seizure, reports, indicate, that, at, least, 857, jaguars, were, involved, in, trade, between, 2012, and, 2018, including, 482, individuals, in, bolivia, alone, 31, jaguars, were, seized, in, china, between, 2014, and, early, 2019, 760, jaguar, fangs, were, seized, that, originated, in, bolivia, and, were, destined, for, china, undercover, investigations, revealed, that, the, smuggling, of, jaguar, body, parts, is, run, by, chinese, residents, in, bolivia, the, jaguar, is, listed, on, cites, appendix, i, which, means, that, all, international, commercial, trade, in, jaguars, or, their, body, parts, is, prohibited, hunting, jaguars, is, prohibited, in, argentina, brazil, colombia, french, guiana, honduras, nicaragua, panama, paraguay, suriname, the, united, states, and, venezuela, hunting, jaguars, is, restricted, in, guatemala, and, peru, in, ecuador, hunting, jaguars, is, prohibited, and, it, is, classified, as, threatened, with, extinction, in, guyana, it, is, protected, as, an, endangered, species, and, hunting, it, is, illegal, in, 1986, the, cockscomb, basin, wildlife, sanctuary, was, established, in, belize, as, the, world, s, first, protected, area, for, jaguar, conservation, in, 1999, field, scientists, from, 18, jaguar, range, countries, determined, the, most, important, areas, for, long, term, jaguar, conservation, based, on, the, status, of, jaguar, population, units, stability, of, prey, base, and, quality, of, habitat, these, areas, called, jaguar, conservation, units, jcus, are, large, enough, for, at, least, 50, breeding, individuals, and, range, in, size, from, 566, to, 67, 598, km, 2, 219, to, 26, 100, sq, mi, 51, jcus, were, designated, in, 36, geographic, regions, including, optimal, routes, of, travel, between, core, jaguar, population, units, were, identified, across, its, range, in, 2010, to, implement, wildlife, corridors, that, connect, jcus, these, corridors, represent, areas, with, the, shortest, distance, between, jaguar, breeding, populations, require, the, least, possible, energy, input, of, dispersing, individuals, and, pose, a, low, mortality, risk, they, cover, an, area, of, 2, 600, 000, km, 2, 1, 000, 000, sq, mi, and, range, in, length, from, 3, to, 1, 102, km, 1, 9, to, 684, 8, mi, in, mexico, and, central, america, and, from, 489, 14, to, 1, 607, km, 303, 94, to, 998, 54, mi, in, south, america, cooperation, with, local, landowners, and, municipal, state, or, federal, agencies, is, essential, to, maintain, connected, populations, and, prevent, fragmentation, in, both, jcus, and, corridors, seven, of, 13, corridors, in, mexico, are, functioning, with, a, width, of, at, least, 14, 25, km, 8, 85, mi, and, a, length, of, no, more, than, 320, km, 200, mi, the, other, corridors, may, hamper, passage, as, they, are, narrower, and, longer, in, august, 2012, the, united, states, fish, and, wildlife, service, set, aside, 3, 392, 20, km, 2, 838, 232, acres, in, arizona, and, new, mexico, for, the, protection, of, the, jaguar, the, jaguar, recovery, plan, was, published, in, april, 2019, in, which, interstate, 10, is, considered, to, form, the, northern, boundary, of, the, jaguar, recovery, unit, in, arizona, and, new, mexico, in, mexico, a, national, conservation, strategy, was, developed, from, 2005, on, and, published, in, 2016, the, mexican, jaguar, population, increased, from, an, estimated, 4, 000, individuals, in, 2010, to, about, 4, 800, individuals, in, 2018, this, increase, is, seen, as, a, positive, effect, of, conservation, measures, that, were, implemented, in, cooperation, with, governmental, and, non, governmental, institutions, and, landowners, an, evaluation, of, jcus, from, mexico, to, argentina, revealed, that, they, overlap, with, high, quality, habitats, of, about, 1, 500, mammals, to, varying, degrees, since, co, occurring, mammals, benefit, from, the, jcu, approach, the, jaguar, has, been, called, an, umbrella, species, central, american, jcus, overlap, with, the, habitat, of, 187, of, 304, regional, endemic, amphibian, and, reptile, species, of, which, 19, amphibians, occur, only, in, the, jaguar, range, in, setting, up, protected, reserves, efforts, generally, also, have, to, be, focused, on, the, surrounding, areas, as, jaguars, are, unlikely, to, confine, themselves, to, the, bounds, of, a, reservation, especially, if, the, population, is, increasing, in, size, human, attitudes, in, the, areas, surrounding, reserves, and, laws, and, regulations, to, prevent, poaching, are, essential, to, make, conservation, areas, effective, to, estimate, population, sizes, within, specific, areas, and, to, keep, track, of, individual, jaguars, camera, trapping, and, wildlife, tracking, telemetry, are, widely, used, and, feces, are, sought, out, with, the, help, of, detection, dogs, to, study, jaguar, health, and, diet, current, conservation, efforts, often, focus, on, educating, ranch, owners, and, promoting, ecotourism, ecotourism, setups, are, being, used, to, generate, public, interest, in, charismatic, animals, such, as, the, jaguar, while, at, the, same, time, generating, revenue, that, can, be, used, in, conservation, efforts, a, key, concern, in, jaguar, ecotourism, is, the, considerable, habitat, space, the, species, requires, if, ecotourism, is, used, to, aid, in, jaguar, conservation, some, considerations, need, to, be, made, as, to, how, existing, ecosystems, will, be, kept, intact, or, how, new, ecosystems, will, be, put, into, place, that, are, large, enough, to, support, a, growing, jaguar, population, conservationists, and, professionals, in, mexico, and, the, united, states, have, established, the, 56, 000, acres, 23, 000, ha, northern, jaguar, reserve, in, northern, mexico, advocacy, for, reintroduction, of, the, jaguar, to, its, former, range, in, arizona, and, new, mexico, have, been, supported, by, documentation, of, natural, migrations, by, individual, jaguars, into, the, southern, reaches, of, both, states, the, recency, of, extirpation, from, those, regions, by, human, action, and, supportive, arguments, pertaining, to, biodiversity, ecological, human, and, practical, considerations, in, the, pre, columbian, americas, the, jaguar, was, a, symbol, of, power, and, strength, in, the, andes, a, jaguar, cult, disseminated, by, the, early, chav, n, culture, became, accepted, over, most, of, today, s, peru, by, 900, bc, the, later, moche, culture, in, northern, peru, used, the, jaguar, as, a, symbol, of, power, in, many, of, their, ceramics, in, the, muisca, religion, in, altiplano, cundiboyacense, the, jaguar, was, considered, a, sacred, animal, and, people, dressed, in, jaguar, skins, during, religious, rituals, the, skins, were, traded, with, peoples, in, the, nearby, orinoqu, a, region, the, name, of, the, muisca, ruler, nemequene, was, derived, from, the, chibcha, words, nymy, and, quyne, meaning, force, of, the, jaguar, sculptures, with, olmec, were, jaguar, motifs, were, found, on, the, yucat, n, peninsula, in, veracruz, and, tabasco, they, show, stylized, jaguars, with, half, human, faces, in, the, later, maya, civilization, the, jaguar, was, known, as, balam, or, bolom, in, many, of, the, mayan, languages, and, was, used, to, symbolize, warriors, and, the, elite, class, for, being, brave, fierce, and, strong, the, cat, was, associated, with, the, underworld, and, its, image, was, used, to, decorate, tombs, and, grave, good, vessels, the, aztec, civilization, called, the, jaguar, ocelotl, and, considered, it, to, be, the, king, of, the, animals, it, was, believed, to, be, fierce, and, courageous, but, also, wise, dignified, and, careful, the, military, had, two, classes, of, warriors, the, ocelotl, or, jaguar, warriors, and, the, cuauhtli, or, eagle, warriors, and, each, dressed, like, their, representative, animal, in, addition, members, of, the, royal, class, would, decorate, in, jaguar, skins, the, jaguar, was, considered, to, be, the, totem, animal, of, the, powerful, deities, tezcatlipoca, and, tepeyollotl, a, conch, shell, gorget, depicting, a, jaguar, was, found, in, a, burial, mound, in, benton, county, missouri, the, gorget, shows, evenly, engraved, lines, and, measures, 104, mm, 98, mm, 4, 1, in, 3, 9, in, rock, drawings, made, by, the, hopi, anasazi, and, pueblo, all, over, the, desert, and, chaparral, regions, of, the, american, southwest, show, an, explicitly, spotted, cat, presumably, a, jaguar, as, it, is, drawn, much, larger, than, an, ocelot, the, jaguar, is, also, used, as, a, symbol, in, contemporary, culture, it, is, the, national, animal, of, guyana, and, is, featured, in, its, coat, of, arms
