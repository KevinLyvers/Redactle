sexual, and, reproductive, health, srh, is, a, field, of, research, health, care, and, social, activism, that, explores, the, health, of, an, individual, s, reproductive, system, and, sexual, well, being, during, all, stages, of, their, life, sexual, and, reproductive, health, is, more, commonly, defined, as, sexual, and, reproductive, health, and, rights, to, encompass, individual, agency, to, make, choices, about, their, sexual, and, reproductive, lives, the, term, can, also, be, further, defined, more, broadly, within, the, framework, of, the, world, health, organization, s, who, definition, of, health, as, a, state, of, complete, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, and, not, merely, the, absence, of, disease, or, infirmity, who, has, a, working, definition, of, sexual, health, 2006, as, a, state, of, physical, emotional, mental, and, social, well, being, in, relation, to, sexuality, it, is, not, merely, the, absence, of, disease, dysfunction, or, infirmity, sexual, health, requires, a, positive, and, respectful, approach, to, sexuality, and, sexual, relationships, as, well, as, the, possibility, of, having, pleasurable, and, safe, sexual, experiences, free, of, coercion, discrimination, and, violence, for, sexual, health, to, be, attained, and, maintained, the, sexual, rights, of, all, persons, must, be, respected, protected, and, fulfilled, this, includes, sexual, wellbeing, encompassing, the, ability, of, an, individual, to, have, responsible, satisfying, and, safe, sex, and, the, freedom, to, decide, if, when, and, how, often, to, do, so, un, agencies, in, particular, define, sexual, and, reproductive, health, as, including, both, physical, and, psychological, well, being, vis, vis, sexuality, furthermore, the, importance, of, ensuring, sexual, lives, are, pleasurable, and, satisfying, and, not, only, focused, on, negative, consequences, of, sex, has, been, emphasized, by, many, agencies, such, as, the, world, association, of, sexual, health, as, well, as, considering, the, positive, impacts, on, health, and, well, being, of, safe, and, satisfying, relationships, a, further, interpretation, includes, access, to, sex, education, access, to, safe, effective, affordable, and, acceptable, methods, of, birth, control, as, well, as, access, to, appropriate, health, care, services, as, the, ability, of, women, to, go, safely, through, pregnancy, and, childbirth, could, provide, couples, with, the, best, chance, of, having, a, healthy, infant, the, critical, guttmacher, lancet, commission, on, sexual, and, reproductive, health, and, rights, states, state, sexual, and, reproductive, health, and, rights, srhr, are, essential, for, sustainable, development, because, of, their, links, to, gender, equality, and, women, s, wellbeing, their, impact, on, maternal, newborn, child, and, adolescent, health, and, their, roles, in, shaping, future, economic, development, and, environmental, sustainability, yet, progress, towards, fulfilling, srhr, for, all, has, been, stymied, because, of, weak, political, commitment, inadequate, resources, persistent, discrimination, against, women, and, girls, and, an, unwillingness, to, address, issues, related, to, sexuality, openly, and, comprehensively, as, a, result, almost, all, of, the, 4, 3, billion, people, of, reproductive, age, worldwide, will, have, inadequate, sexual, and, reproductive, health, services, over, the, course, of, their, lives, individuals, face, inequalities, in, reproductive, health, services, inequalities, vary, based, on, socioeconomic, status, education, level, age, ethnicity, religion, and, resources, available, in, their, environment, low, income, individuals, may, lack, access, to, appropriate, health, services, and, or, knowledge, of, how, to, maintain, reproductive, health, additionally, many, approaches, involving, women, families, and, local, communities, as, active, stakeholders, in, interventions, and, strategies, to, improve, reproductive, health, the, who, assessed, in, 2008, that, reproductive, and, sexual, ill, health, accounts, for, 20, of, the, global, burden, of, ill, health, for, women, and, 14, for, men, reproductive, health, is, a, part, of, sexual, and, reproductive, health, and, rights, according, to, the, united, nations, population, fund, unfpa, unmet, needs, for, sexual, and, reproductive, health, deprive, women, of, the, right, to, make, crucial, choices, about, their, own, bodies, and, futures, affecting, family, welfare, women, bear, and, usually, nurture, children, so, their, reproductive, health, is, inseparable, from, gender, equality, denial, of, such, rights, also, worsens, poverty, adolescent, health, creates, a, major, global, burden, and, has, a, great, deal, of, additional, and, diverse, complications, compared, to, adult, reproductive, health, such, as, early, pregnancy, and, parenting, issues, difficulties, accessing, contraception, and, safe, abortions, lack, of, healthcare, access, and, high, rates, of, hiv, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, mental, health, issues, each, of, those, can, be, affected, by, outside, political, economic, and, socio, cultural, influences, for, most, adolescent, females, they, have, yet, to, complete, their, body, growth, trajectories, therefore, adding, a, pregnancy, exposes, them, to, a, predisposition, to, complications, these, complications, range, from, anemia, malaria, hiv, and, other, stis, postpartum, bleeding, and, other, postpartum, complications, mental, health, disorders, such, as, depression, and, suicidal, thoughts, or, attempts, in, 2016, adolescent, birth, rates, between, the, ages, of, 15, 19, was, 45, per, 1000, in, 2014, 1, in, 3, experienced, sexual, violence, and, there, more, than, 1, 2, million, deaths, the, top, three, leading, causes, of, death, in, females, between, the, ages, of, 15, 19, are, maternal, conditions, 10, 1, self, harm, 9, 6, and, road, conditions, 6, 1, the, causes, of, teenage, pregnancy, are, vast, and, diverse, in, developing, countries, young, women, are, pressured, to, marry, for, different, reasons, one, reason, is, to, bear, children, to, help, with, work, another, on, a, dowry, system, to, increase, the, families, income, another, is, due, to, prearranged, marriages, these, reasons, tie, back, to, the, financial, needs, of, girls, families, cultural, norms, religious, beliefs, and, external, conflicts, adolescent, pregnancy, especially, in, developing, countries, carries, increased, health, risks, and, contributes, to, maintaining, the, cycle, of, poverty, the, availability, and, type, of, sex, education, for, teenagers, varies, in, different, parts, of, the, world, teens, that, are, self, identified, as, non, heterosexual, may, develop, additional, problems, if, they, live, in, places, where, homosexual, activity, is, socially, disapproved, or, even, illegal, in, extreme, cases, there, can, be, depression, social, isolation, and, even, suicide, among, lgbt, youth, 95, of, maternal, deaths, occur, in, low, income, contexts, and, countries, and, in, 25, years, the, maternal, mortality, globally, dropped, to, 44, statistically, a, woman, s, chance, of, survival, during, childbirth, is, closely, tied, to, her, social, economic, status, access, to, healthcare, where, she, lives, geographically, and, cultural, norms, to, compare, a, woman, dies, of, complications, from, childbirth, every, minute, in, developing, countries, versus, a, total, of, 1, of, total, maternal, mortality, deaths, in, developed, countries, women, in, developing, countries, have, little, access, to, family, planning, services, different, cultural, practices, lack, of, information, birthing, attendants, prenatal, care, birth, control, postnatal, care, lack, of, access, to, health, care, and, are, typically, in, poverty, in, 2015, those, in, low, income, countries, had, access, to, antenatal, care, visits, averaged, 40, and, were, preventable, all, these, reasons, led, to, an, increase, in, the, maternal, mortality, ratio, mmr, one, of, the, international, sustainable, development, goals, developed, by, united, nations, is, to, improve, maternal, health, by, a, targeted, 70, deaths, per, 100, 000, live, births, by, 2030, most, models, of, maternal, health, encompass, family, planning, preconception, prenatal, and, postnatal, care, all, care, after, childbirth, recovery, is, typically, excluded, which, includes, pre, menopause, and, aging, into, old, age, during, childbirth, women, typically, die, from, severe, bleeding, infections, high, blood, pressure, during, pregnancy, delivery, complications, or, an, unsafe, abortion, other, reasons, can, be, regional, such, as, complications, related, to, diseases, such, as, malaria, and, aids, during, pregnancy, the, younger, the, woman, is, when, she, gives, birth, the, more, at, risk, she, and, her, baby, are, for, complications, and, possible, mortality, there, is, a, significant, relationship, between, the, quality, of, maternal, services, made, available, and, the, greater, financial, standings, of, a, country, sub, saharan, africa, and, south, asia, exemplify, this, as, these, regions, are, significantly, deprived, of, medical, staff, and, affordable, health, opportunities, most, countries, provide, for, their, health, services, through, a, combination, of, funding, from, government, tax, revenue, and, local, households, poorer, nations, or, regions, with, extremely, concentrated, wealth, can, leave, citizens, on, the, margins, uncared, for, or, overlooked, however, the, lack, of, proper, leadership, can, result, in, a, nation, s, public, sectors, being, mishandled, or, poorly, performing, despite, said, nation, s, resources, and, standing, in, addition, poorer, nations, funding, their, medical, services, through, taxes, places, a, greater, financial, burden, on, the, public, and, effectively, the, mothers, themselves, responsibility, and, accountability, on, the, part, of, mental, health, sectors, are, strongly, emphasized, as, to, what, will, remedy, the, poor, quality, of, maternal, health, globally, the, impact, of, different, maternal, health, interventions, across, the, globe, stagger, variously, and, are, vastly, uneven, this, is, the, result, of, a, lack, of, political, and, financial, commitment, to, the, issue, as, most, safe, motherhood, programs, internationally, have, to, compete, for, significant, funding, some, resolve, that, if, global, survival, initiatives, were, promoted, and, properly, funded, it, would, prove, to, be, mutually, beneficial, for, the, international, community, investing, in, maternal, health, would, ultimately, advance, several, issues, such, as, gender, inequality, poverty, and, general, global, health, standards, as, it, currently, stands, pregnant, women, are, subjugated, to, high, financial, costs, throughout, the, duration, of, their, term, internationally, which, is, highly, taxing, and, strenuous, in, addition, if, either, parent, has, a, genetic, disease, there, is, risk, of, these, being, passed, on, to, the, children, birth, control, or, technical, solutions, assisted, reproductive, technology, can, be, an, option, then, the, sexual, and, reproductive, health, of, lgbt, people, face, challenges, through, issues, like, the, ongoing, hiv, pandemic, binary, organization, of, men, and, women, s, reproductive, health, alongside, stigma, and, repression, that, limit, lgbt, people, from, accessing, the, healthcare, they, need, sexual, health, is, a, state, of, physical, emotional, mental, and, social, well, being, in, relation, to, sexuality, it, is, important, to, not, only, consider, the, sexual, physical, health, of, an, individual, but, also, the, cultural, and, contextual, factors, that, influence, an, individual, s, well, being, the, lack, of, competent, providers, and, stigma, attached, to, homosexuality, have, a, great, impact, on, the, sexual, health, of, the, lgbtq, population, the, lgbtq, population, faces, a, number, of, obstacles, in, terms, of, sexual, and, reproductive, health, the, different, stigmas, and, biases, that, come, with, these, barriers, make, receiving, proper, care, difficult, some, of, these, stigmas, that, follow, those, in, the, lgbtq, population, in, terms, of, their, sexual, and, reproductive, health, are, associating, certain, diseases, and, other, illnesses, with, this, community, this, leaves, those, in, the, lgbtq, population, in, a, position, that, makes, them, vulnerable, as, well, as, victims, of, a, number, of, health, disparities, the, overall, health, of, those, in, the, lgbtq, population, is, determinant, on, sexual, and, reproductive, health, as, these, all, make, up, the, health, of, these, individuals, those, in, the, lgbtq, community, face, also, face, discrimination, from, providers, and, insurance, companies, on, top, of, all, of, the, other, barriers, and, limits, on, access, to, care, that, they, endure, all, of, these, factors, have, led, to, those, in, the, lgbtq, population, having, worse, health, outcomes, access, to, reproductive, health, services, is, very, poor, in, many, countries, women, are, often, unable, to, access, maternal, health, services, due, to, a, lack, of, knowledge, about, the, existence, of, such, services, or, lack, of, freedom, of, movement, some, women, are, subjected, to, forced, pregnancy, and, banned, from, leaving, the, home, in, many, countries, women, are, not, allowed, to, leave, home, without, a, male, relative, or, husband, and, therefore, their, ability, to, access, medical, services, is, limited, therefore, increasing, women, s, autonomy, is, needed, in, order, to, improve, reproductive, health, however, doing, so, may, require, a, cultural, shift, according, to, the, who, all, women, need, access, to, antenatal, care, in, pregnancy, skilled, care, during, childbirth, and, care, and, support, in, the, weeks, after, childbirth, the, fact, that, the, law, allows, certain, reproductive, health, services, does, not, necessarily, ensure, that, such, services, are, actually, in, use, by, the, people, the, availability, of, contraception, sterilization, and, abortion, is, dependent, on, laws, as, well, as, social, cultural, and, religious, norms, some, countries, have, liberal, laws, regarding, these, issues, but, in, practice, it, is, very, difficult, to, access, such, services, due, to, doctors, pharmacists, and, other, social, and, medical, workers, being, conscientious, objectors, in, developing, regions, of, the, world, there, are, about, 214, million, women, who, want, to, avoid, pregnancy, but, are, unable, to, use, safe, and, effective, family, planning, methods, when, taken, correctly, the, combined, oral, contraceptive, pill, is, over, 99, effective, at, preventing, pregnancy, however, it, does, not, protect, from, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, some, methods, such, as, using, condoms, achieve, both, protection, from, stis, and, unwanted, pregnancies, there, are, also, natural, family, planning, methods, which, may, be, preferred, by, religious, people, but, some, very, conservative, religious, groups, such, as, the, quiverfull, movement, oppose, these, methods, too, because, they, advocate, the, maximization, of, procreation, one, of, the, oldest, ways, to, reduce, unwanted, pregnancy, is, coitus, interruptus, still, widely, used, in, the, developing, world, there, are, many, types, of, contraceptives, one, type, of, contraceptive, includes, barrier, methods, one, barrier, method, includes, condoms, for, males, and, females, both, types, stop, sperm, from, entering, the, woman, s, uterus, thereby, preventing, pregnancy, from, occurring, another, type, of, contraception, is, the, birth, control, pill, which, stops, ovulation, from, occurring, by, combining, the, chemicals, progestin, and, estrogen, many, women, use, this, method, of, contraception, however, they, discontinue, using, it, equally, as, much, as, they, use, it, one, reason, for, this, is, because, of, the, side, effects, that, may, occur, from, using, the, pill, and, because, some, health, care, providers, do, not, take, women, s, concerns, about, negative, side, effects, seriously, the, use, of, the, birth, control, pill, is, common, in, western, countries, and, two, forms, of, combined, oral, contraceptives, are, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, the, most, important, medications, needed, in, a, basic, health, system, there, are, many, objections, to, the, use, of, birth, control, both, historically, and, in, the, present, day, one, argument, against, birth, control, usage, states, that, there, is, no, need, for, birth, control, to, begin, with, this, argument, was, levied, in, 1968, when, richard, nixon, was, elected, president, and, the, argument, stated, that, since, birth, rates, were, at, their, lowest, point, since, world, war, ii, ended, birth, control, was, not, necessary, demographic, planning, arguments, were, also, the, basis, of, the, population, policy, of, nicolae, ceau, escu, in, communist, romania, who, adopted, a, very, aggressive, natalist, policy, which, included, outlawing, abortion, and, contraception, routine, pregnancy, tests, for, women, taxes, on, childlessness, and, legal, discrimination, against, childless, people, such, policies, consider, that, coercion, is, an, acceptable, means, of, reaching, demographic, targets, religious, objections, are, based, on, the, view, that, premarital, sex, should, not, happen, while, married, couples, should, have, as, many, children, as, possible, as, such, the, catholic, church, encourages, premarital, abstinence, from, sex, this, argument, was, written, out, in, humanae, vitae, a, papal, encyclical, released, in, 1968, the, catholic, church, bases, its, argument, against, birth, control, pills, on, the, basis, that, birth, control, pills, undermine, the, natural, law, of, god, the, catholic, church, also, argues, against, birth, control, on, the, basis, of, family, size, with, cardinal, mercier, of, belgium, arguing, the, duties, of, conscience, are, above, worldly, considerations, and, besides, it, is, the, large, families, who, are, the, best, reiterman, 216, another, argument, states, that, women, should, use, natural, methods, of, contraception, in, place, of, artificial, ones, such, as, having, sexual, intercourse, when, one, is, infertile, support, for, contraception, is, based, on, views, such, as, reproductive, rights, women, s, rights, and, the, necessity, to, prevent, child, abandonment, and, child, poverty, the, world, health, organization, states, that, by, preventing, unintended, pregnancy, family, planning, contraception, prevents, deaths, of, mothers, and, children, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, sti, previously, known, as, a, sexually, transmitted, disease, std, or, venereal, disease, vd, is, an, infection, that, has, a, significant, likelihood, of, transmission, between, humans, by, means, of, sexual, activity, the, cdc, analyses, the, eight, most, common, stis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis, b, virus, hbv, herpes, simplex, virus, type, 2, hsv, 2, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, human, papillomavirus, hpv, syphilis, and, trichomoniasis, there, are, 1, million, new, infections, a, day, and, more, than, 20, million, new, cases, within, the, united, states, in, 2020, who, estimated, 374, million, new, infections, with, 1, of, 4, stis, chlamydia, 129, million, gonorrhoea, 82, million, syphilis, 7, 1, million, and, trichomoniasis, 156, million, more, than, 490, million, people, were, estimated, to, be, living, with, genital, herpes, in, 2016, and, an, estimated, 300, million, women, have, an, hpv, infection, the, primary, cause, of, cervical, cancer, and, anal, cancer, among, men, who, have, sex, with, men, numbers, of, such, high, magnitude, weigh, a, heavy, burden, on, the, local, and, global, economy, a, study, conducted, at, oxford, university, in, 2015, concluded, that, despite, giving, participants, early, antiviral, medications, art, they, still, cost, an, estimated, 256, billion, over, 2, decades, hiv, testing, done, at, modest, rates, could, reduce, hiv, infections, by, 21, hiv, retention, by, 54, and, hiv, mortality, rates, by, 64, with, a, cost, effectiveness, ratio, of, 45, 300, per, quality, adjusted, life, year, however, the, study, concluded, that, the, united, states, has, led, to, an, excess, in, infections, treatment, costs, and, deaths, even, when, interventions, do, not, improve, overall, survival, rates, there, is, a, profound, reduction, in, sti, rates, once, those, who, are, sexually, active, are, educated, about, transmissions, condom, promotion, interventions, targeted, at, key, and, vulnerable, populations, through, comprehensive, sex, education, courses, or, programs, recent, evidence, shows, that, acknowledging, the, role, pleasure, takes, in, people, s, sexual, lives, and, integrating, this, in, sexual, health, services, and, education, has, a, significant, impact, on, increasing, condom, use, and, improved, sexual, health, outcomes, south, africa, s, policy, addresses, the, needs, of, women, at, risk, for, hiv, and, who, are, hiv, positive, as, well, as, their, partners, and, children, the, policy, also, promotes, screening, activities, related, to, sexual, health, such, as, hiv, counseling, and, testing, as, well, as, testing, for, other, stis, tuberculosis, cervical, cancer, and, breast, cancer, the, cdc, stated, that, the, rate, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, is, higher, among, minorities, compared, to, white, people, these, minorities, are, currently, being, affected, by, different, factors, including, health, literacy, socioeconomic, status, access, to, health, services, and, fear, of, discrimination, by, health, providers, the, rates, of, infection, are, five, to, eight, times, higher, in, the, black, community, compared, to, non, hispanic, white, people, young, african, american, women, are, at, a, higher, risk, for, stis, including, hiv, a, recent, study, published, outside, of, atlanta, georgia, collected, data, demographic, psychological, and, behavioral, measures, with, a, vaginal, swab, to, confirm, the, presence, of, stis, they, found, a, profound, difference, that, those, women, who, had, graduated, from, college, were, far, less, likely, to, have, stis, potentially, be, benefiting, from, a, reduction, in, vulnerability, to, acquiring, stis, hiv, as, they, gain, in, education, status, and, potentially, move, up, in, demographic, areas, and, or, status, globally, an, estimated, 25, million, unsafe, abortions, occur, each, year, the, vast, majority, of, such, unsafe, abortions, occur, in, developing, countries, in, africa, asia, and, latin, america, the, abortion, debate, is, the, ongoing, controversy, surrounding, the, moral, legal, and, religious, status, of, induced, abortion, the, sides, involved, in, the, debate, are, the, self, described, pro, choice, and, pro, life, movements, pro, choice, emphasizes, the, right, of, women, to, decide, whether, to, terminate, a, pregnancy, pro, life, emphasizes, the, right, of, the, embryo, or, fetus, to, gestate, to, term, and, be, born, both, terms, are, considered, loaded, in, mainstream, media, where, terms, such, as, abortion, rights, or, anti, abortion, are, generally, preferred, each, movement, has, with, varying, results, sought, to, influence, public, opinion, and, to, attain, legal, support, for, its, position, with, small, numbers, of, radical, activists, using, violence, such, as, murder, and, arson, articles, from, the, world, health, organization, call, legal, abortion, a, fundamental, right, of, women, regardless, of, where, they, live, and, argue, that, unsafe, abortion, is, a, silent, pandemic, in, 2005, it, was, estimated, that, 19, 20, million, abortions, had, complications, some, complications, are, permanent, while, another, estimated, 68, 000, women, died, from, unsafe, abortions, having, access, to, safe, abortion, can, have, positive, impacts, on, women, s, health, and, life, and, vice, versa, legislation, of, abortion, on, request, is, necessary, but, an, insufficient, step, towards, improving, women, s, health, in, some, countries, where, it, abortion, is, legal, and, has, been, for, decades, there, has, been, no, improvement, in, access, to, adequate, services, making, abortion, unsafe, due, to, lack, of, healthcare, services, it, is, hard, to, get, an, abortion, due, to, legal, and, policy, barriers, social, and, cultural, barriers, gender, discrimination, poverty, religious, restrictions, lack, of, support, health, system, barriers, lack, of, facilities, or, trained, personnel, however, safe, abortions, with, trained, personnel, good, social, support, and, access, to, facilities, can, improve, maternal, health, and, increase, reproductive, health, later, in, life, the, maputo, protocol, which, was, adopted, by, the, african, union, in, the, form, of, a, protocol, to, the, african, charter, on, human, and, peoples, rights, states, at, article, 14, health, and, reproductive, rights, that, 2, states, parties, shall, take, all, appropriate, measures, to, c, protect, the, reproductive, rights, of, women, by, authorising, medical, abortion, in, cases, of, sexual, assault, rape, incest, and, where, the, continued, pregnancy, endangers, the, mental, and, physical, health, of, the, mother, or, the, life, of, the, mother, or, the, foetus, the, maputo, protocol, is, the, first, international, treaty, to, recognize, abortion, under, certain, conditions, as, a, woman, s, human, right, the, general, comment, no, 36, 2018, on, article, 6, of, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, on, the, right, to, life, adopted, by, the, human, rights, committee, in, 2018, defines, for, the, first, time, ever, a, human, right, to, abortion, in, certain, circumstances, however, these, un, general, comments, are, considered, soft, law, and, as, such, not, legally, binding, although, states, parties, may, adopt, measures, designed, to, regulate, voluntary, terminations, of, pregnancy, such, measures, must, not, result, in, violation, of, the, right, to, life, of, a, pregnant, woman, or, girl, or, her, other, rights, under, the, covenant, thus, restrictions, on, the, ability, of, women, or, girls, to, seek, abortion, must, not, inter, alia, jeopardize, their, lives, subject, them, to, physical, or, mental, pain, or, suffering, which, violates, article, 7, discriminate, against, them, or, arbitrarily, interfere, with, their, privacy, states, parties, must, provide, safe, legal, and, effective, access, to, abortion, where, the, life, and, health, of, the, pregnant, woman, or, girl, is, at, risk, and, where, carrying, a, pregnancy, to, term, would, cause, the, pregnant, woman, or, girl, substantial, pain, or, suffering, most, notably, where, the, pregnancy, is, the, result, of, rape, or, incest, or, is, not, viable, in, addition, states, parties, may, not, regulate, pregnancy, or, abortion, in, all, other, cases, in, a, manner, that, runs, contrary, to, their, duty, to, ensure, that, women, and, girls, do, not, have, to, undertake, unsafe, abortions, and, they, should, revise, their, abortion, laws, accordingly, for, example, they, should, not, take, measures, such, as, criminalizing, pregnancies, by, unmarried, women, or, apply, criminal, sanctions, against, women, and, girls, undergoing, abortion, or, against, medical, service, providers, assisting, them, in, doing, so, since, taking, such, measures, compel, women, and, girls, to, resort, to, unsafe, abortion, states, parties, should, not, introduce, new, barriers, and, should, remove, existing, barriers, that, deny, effective, access, by, women, and, girls, to, safe, and, legal, abortion, including, barriers, caused, as, a, result, of, the, exercise, of, conscientious, objection, by, individual, medical, providers, when, negotiating, the, cairo, programme, of, action, at, the, 1994, international, conference, on, population, and, development, icpd, the, issue, was, so, contentious, that, delegates, eventually, decided, to, omit, any, recommendation, to, legalize, abortion, instead, advising, governments, to, provide, proper, post, abortion, care, and, to, invest, in, programs, that, will, decrease, the, number, of, unwanted, pregnancies, the, committee, on, the, elimination, of, discrimination, against, women, considers, the, criminalization, of, abortion, a, violations, of, women, s, sexual, and, reproductive, health, and, rights, and, a, form, of, gender, based, violence, paragraph, 18, of, its, general, recommendation, no, 35, on, gender, based, violence, against, women, updating, general, recommendation, no, 19, states, that, violations, of, women, s, sexual, and, reproductive, health, and, rights, such, as, forced, sterilizations, forced, abortion, forced, pregnancy, criminalisation, of, abortion, denial, or, delay, of, safe, abortion, and, post, abortion, care, forced, continuation, of, pregnancy, abuse, and, mistreatment, of, women, and, girls, seeking, sexual, and, reproductive, health, information, goods, and, services, are, forms, of, gender, based, violence, that, depending, on, the, circumstances, may, amount, to, torture, or, cruel, inhuman, or, degrading, treatment, the, same, general, recommendation, also, urges, countries, at, paragraph, 31, to, in, particular, repeal, a, provisions, that, allow, tolerate, or, condone, forms, of, gender, based, violence, against, women, including, legislation, that, criminalises, abortion, in, 2008, the, parliamentary, assembly, of, the, council, of, europe, a, group, comprising, members, from, 47, european, countries, has, adopted, a, resolution, calling, for, the, decriminalization, of, abortion, within, reasonable, gestational, limits, and, guaranteed, access, to, safe, abortion, procedures, the, nonbinding, resolution, was, passed, on, april, 16, by, a, vote, of, 102, to, 69, accesses, to, abortion, is, not, only, a, question, of, legality, but, also, an, issue, of, overcoming, de, facto, barriers, such, as, conscientious, objections, from, medical, staff, high, prices, lack, of, knowledge, about, the, law, lack, of, access, to, medical, care, especially, in, rural, areas, the, de, facto, inability, of, women, to, access, abortion, even, in, countries, where, it, is, legal, is, highly, controversial, because, it, results, in, a, situation, where, women, have, rights, only, on, paper, not, in, practice, the, un, in, its, 2017, resolution, on, intensification, of, efforts, to, prevent, and, eliminate, all, forms, of, violence, against, women, and, girls, domestic, violence, urged, states, to, guarantee, access, to, safe, abortion, where, such, services, are, permitted, by, national, law, there, are, two, primary, arguments, for, maintaining, legalized, abortion, today, in, the, u, s, the, first, is, recognizing, the, full, citizenship, of, women, the, roe, v, wade, court, case, on, abortion, compared, the, citizenship, of, women, and, fetuses, because, the, constitution, defines, born, people, as, citizens, justice, harry, blackmun, ruled, that, fetuses, were, not, citizens, the, citizenship, of, women, is, emphasized, because, fetuses, are, not, individual, entities, that, can, exist, without, the, woman, another, reason, why, the, full, citizenship, of, women, is, defined, by, advocates, for, abortion, is, that, it, recognizes, the, right, of, women, to, manage, their, own, bodies, fertility, affects, women, s, bodies, the, argument, for, abortion, prevents, others, from, making, decisions, that, alter, a, woman, s, body, pro, choice, advocates, also, attempt, to, confirm, that, state, mandated, education, or, other, outside, biases, do, not, attempt, to, influence, these, decisions, feminists, argue, that, women, throughout, history, have, had, to, justify, their, citizenship, politically, and, socially, the, right, to, manage, one, s, own, body, is, a, matter, of, health, safety, and, respect, the, citizenship, of, women, and, the, right, to, manage, their, own, bodies, is, a, societal, confirmation, that, feminists, highlight, as, a, pro, choice, justification, the, second, primary, argument, to, uphold, legalized, abortion, and, creating, better, access, to, it, is, the, necessity, of, abortion, and, the, health, and, safety, of, pregnant, women, there, are, two, events, that, largely, changed, the, course, of, public, opinion, about, abortion, in, the, u, s, the, first, is, sherry, finkbine, who, was, denied, access, to, an, abortion, by, the, board, of, obstetrician, gynecologists, at, her, local, hospital, although, she, was, privileged, enough, to, afford, the, trip, finkbine, was, forced, to, travel, to, sweden, for, an, abortion, to, avoid, caring, for, a, damaged, fetus, in, addition, to, four, children, the, other, event, that, changed, public, opinion, was, the, outbreak, of, rubella, in, the, 1950s, and, 60s, because, rubella, disrupted, the, growth, of, fetuses, and, caused, deformities, during, pregnancy, the, california, therapeutic, abortion, act, was, signed, in, 1967, permitting, doctors, to, legally, abort, pregnancies, that, pose, a, risk, to, a, pregnant, woman, s, physical, or, mental, health, these, two, events, are, commonly, used, to, show, how, the, health, and, safety, of, pregnant, women, are, contingent, upon, abortions, as, well, as, the, ability, to, give, birth, to, and, adequately, take, care, of, a, child, another, argument, in, favor, of, legalized, abortion, to, service, necessity, are, the, reasons, why, an, abortion, might, be, necessary, nearly, half, of, all, pregnancies, in, the, united, states, are, unintended, and, over, half, of, all, unintended, pregnancies, in, the, united, states, are, met, with, abortion, unintended, pregnancy, can, lead, to, serious, harm, to, women, and, children, for, reasons, such, as, not, being, able, to, afford, to, raise, a, baby, inaccessibility, to, time, off, of, work, difficulties, facing, single, motherhood, difficult, socio, economic, conditions, for, women, unintended, pregnancies, also, have, a, greater, potential, for, putting, women, of, color, at, risk, due, to, systematically, produced, environmental, hazards, from, proximity, to, pollution, access, to, livable, income, and, affordable, healthy, food, these, factors, as, threats, to, the, health, and, safety, of, pregnant, women, run, parallel, to, data, that, shows, the, number, of, abortions, in, the, united, states, did, not, decline, while, laws, restricting, legal, access, to, abortion, were, implemented, at, a, global, level, the, region, with, the, strictest, abortion, laws, is, considered, to, be, latin, america, see, reproductive, rights, in, latin, america, a, region, strongly, influenced, by, the, catholic, church, in, latin, america, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, also, known, as, female, genital, circumcision, or, cutting, is, the, traditional, non, medical, practice, of, altering, or, injuring, the, female, reproductive, organs, often, by, removing, all, or, parts, of, the, external, genitalia, it, is, mostly, practiced, in, 30, countries, in, africa, the, middle, east, and, asia, and, affects, over, 200, million, women, and, girls, worldwide, more, severe, forms, of, fgm, are, highly, concentrated, in, djibouti, eritrea, ethiopia, somalia, and, sudan, the, who, categorizes, fgm, into, four, types, fgm, often, takes, the, form, of, a, traditional, celebration, conducted, by, an, elder, or, community, leader, the, age, that, women, undergo, the, procedure, varies, depending, on, the, culture, although, it, is, most, commonly, performed, on, prepubescent, girls, certain, cultures, value, fgm, as, a, coming, of, age, ritual, for, girls, and, use, it, to, preserve, a, woman, s, virginity, and, faithfulness, to, the, husband, after, marriage, it, is, also, closely, connected, with, some, traditional, ideals, of, female, beauty, and, hygiene, fgm, may, or, may, not, have, religious, connotations, depending, on, the, circumstances, there, are, no, health, benefits, of, fgm, as, it, interferes, with, the, natural, functions, of, a, woman, s, and, girls, bodies, such, as, causing, severe, pain, shock, hemorrhage, tetanus, or, sepsis, bacterial, infection, urine, retention, open, sores, in, the, genital, region, and, injury, to, nearby, genital, tissue, recurrent, bladder, and, urinary, tract, infections, cysts, increased, risk, of, infertility, childbirth, complications, and, newborn, deaths, sexual, problems, are, 1, 5, more, likely, to, occur, in, women, who, have, undergone, fgm, they, may, experience, painful, intercourse, have, less, sexual, satisfaction, and, be, two, times, more, likely, to, report, a, lack, of, sexual, desire, in, addition, the, maternal, and, fetal, death, rate, is, significantly, higher, due, to, childbirth, complications, fgm, can, have, severe, negative, psychological, effects, on, women, both, during, and, after, the, procedure, these, can, include, long, term, symptoms, of, depression, anxiety, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, and, low, self, esteem, some, women, report, that, the, procedure, was, carried, out, without, their, consent, and, knowledge, and, describe, feelings, of, fear, and, helplessness, while, it, was, taking, place, a, 2018, study, found, that, larger, quantities, of, the, hormone, cortisol, were, secreted, in, women, who, had, undergone, fgm, especially, those, who, had, experienced, more, severe, forms, of, the, procedure, and, at, an, early, age, this, marks, the, body, s, chemical, response, to, trauma, and, stress, and, can, indicate, a, greater, risk, for, developing, symptoms, of, ptsd, and, other, trauma, disorders, although, there, are, limited, studies, showing, a, direct, correlation, the, istanbul, convention, prohibits, fgm, article, 38, legislation, has, been, introduced, in, certain, countries, to, prevent, fgm, a, 2016, survey, of, 30, countries, showed, 24, had, policies, to, manage, and, prevent, fgm, although, the, process, to, provide, funding, education, and, resources, were, often, inconsistent, and, lacking, some, countries, have, seen, a, slight, decline, in, fgm, rates, while, others, show, little, to, no, change, the, practice, of, forcing, young, girls, into, early, marriage, common, in, many, parts, of, the, world, is, threatening, their, reproductive, health, according, to, the, world, health, organization, the, sexual, and, reproductive, health, of, the, female, in, a, child, marriage, is, likely, to, be, jeopardized, as, these, young, girls, are, often, forced, into, sexual, intercourse, with, an, older, male, spouse, with, more, sexual, experience, the, female, spouse, often, lacks, the, status, and, the, knowledge, to, negotiate, for, safe, sex, and, contraceptive, practices, increasing, the, risk, of, acquiring, hiv, or, other, sexually, transmitted, infections, as, well, as, the, probability, of, pregnancy, at, an, early, age, niger, has, the, highest, prevalence, of, child, marriage, under, 18, in, the, world, while, bangladesh, has, the, highest, rate, of, marriage, of, girls, under, age, 15, practices, such, as, bride, price, and, dowry, can, contribute, to, child, and, forced, marriages, the, international, conference, on, population, and, development, icpd, was, held, in, cairo, egypt, from, 5, to, 13, september, 1994, delegations, from, 179, states, took, part, in, negotiations, to, finalize, a, programme, of, action, on, population, and, development, for, the, next, 20, years, some, 20, 000, delegates, from, various, governments, un, agencies, ngos, and, the, media, gathered, for, a, discussion, of, a, variety, of, population, issues, including, immigration, infant, mortality, birth, control, family, planning, and, the, education, of, women, in, the, icpd, program, of, action, reproductive, health, is, defined, as, a, state, of, complete, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, and, not, merely, the, absence, of, disease, or, infirmity, in, all, matters, relating, to, the, reproductive, system, and, its, functions, and, processes, reproductive, health, therefore, implies, that, people, are, able, to, have, a, satisfying, and, safe, sex, life, and, that, they, have, the, capability, to, reproduce, and, the, freedom, to, decide, if, when, and, how, often, to, do, so, implicit, in, this, last, condition, are, the, right, of, men, and, women, to, be, informed, and, to, have, access, to, safe, effective, affordable, and, acceptable, methods, of, family, planning, of, their, choice, as, well, as, other, methods, of, birth, control, which, are, not, against, the, law, and, the, right, of, access, to, appropriate, health, care, services, that, will, enable, women, to, go, safely, through, pregnancy, and, childbirth, and, provide, couples, with, the, best, chance, of, having, a, healthy, infant, this, definition, of, the, term, is, also, echoed, in, the, united, nations, fourth, world, conference, on, women, or, the, so, called, beijing, declaration, of, 1995, however, the, icpd, program, of, action, even, though, it, received, the, support, of, a, large, majority, of, un, member, states, does, not, enjoy, the, status, of, an, international, legal, instrument, it, is, therefore, not, legally, binding, the, program, of, action, endorses, a, new, strategy, which, emphasizes, the, numerous, linkages, between, population, and, development, and, focuses, on, meeting, the, needs, of, individual, women, and, men, rather, than, on, achieving, demographic, targets, the, icpd, achieved, consensus, on, four, qualitative, and, quantitative, goals, for, the, international, community, the, final, two, of, which, have, particular, relevance, for, reproductive, health, the, keys, to, this, new, approach, are, empowering, women, providing, them, with, more, choices, through, expanded, access, to, education, and, health, services, and, promoting, skill, development, and, employment, the, programme, advocates, making, family, planning, universally, available, by, 2015, or, sooner, as, part, of, a, broadened, approach, to, reproductive, health, and, rights, provides, estimates, of, the, levels, of, national, resources, and, international, assistance, that, will, be, required, and, calls, on, governments, to, make, these, resources, available, half, of, the, development, goals, put, on, by, the, united, nations, started, in, 2000, to, 2015, with, the, millennium, development, goals, mdgs, reproductive, health, was, goal, 5, out, of, 8, to, monitor, the, progress, the, un, agreed, to, four, indicators, progress, was, slow, and, according, to, the, who, in, 2005, about, 55, of, women, did, not, have, sufficient, antenatal, care, and, 24, had, no, access, to, family, planning, services, the, mdgs, expired, in, 2015, and, were, replaced, with, a, more, comprehensive, set, of, goals, to, cover, a, span, of, 2016, 2030, with, a, total, of, 17, goals, called, the, sustainable, development, goals, all, 17, goals, are, comprehensive, in, nature, and, build, off, one, another, but, goal, 3, is, to, ensure, healthy, lives, and, promote, wellbeing, for, all, at, all, ages, specific, targets, are, to, reduce, global, maternal, mortality, ratio, to, less, than, 70, per, 100, 000, live, births, end, preventable, deaths, of, newborns, and, children, reduce, the, number, by, 50, of, accidental, deaths, globally, strengthen, the, treatment, and, prevention, programs, of, substance, abuse, and, alcohol, goal, 4, emphasizes, the, fact, that, no, one, should, be, left, out, in, providing, quality, education, target, 4, specifically, mentions, the, inclusion, of, persons, with, disabilities, indigenous, peoples, and, children, in, vulnerable, situations, in, addition, one, of, the, targets, of, the, sustainable, development, goal, 5, is, to, ensure, universal, access, to, sexual, and, reproductive, health, the, cdc, estimated, that, one, in, five, people, in, the, us, had, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, sti, totalling, near, about, 68, million, infections, in, 2018, 26, million, new, sti, in, 2018, almost, half, of, new, sti, were, among, youth, aged, 15, to, 24, in, the, us, new, stis, total, 16, billion, in, direct, medical, costs, engaging, in, oral, sex, can, carry, the, risk, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, hiv, aids, hiv, aids, in, africa, is, a, major, public, health, problem, the, population, of, sub, saharan, africa, is, the, worst, affected, region, with, the, disease, especially, affecting, the, young, female, population, according, to, the, national, library, of, medicine, sub, saharan, africa, ssa, is, occupied, by, 12, of, the, global, population, but, disproportionately, has, more, than, 90, of, children, younger, than, 15, years, of, age, and, 68, of, adults, that, are, living, with, hiv2, in, nigeria, in, specific, there, is, early, sexual, maturity, and, considerable, sexual, activity, between, 9, and, 15, years, of, age, hiv, is, also, transmissible, through, breast, milk, which, proves, that, women, infected, with, hiv, aids, have, to, deal, with, more, health, consequences, south, of, the, sahara, the, aids, epidemic, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, the, reasons, for, the, high, spread, of, hiv, aids, can, be, broken, down, into, 7, main, subsections, poverty, inadequate, medical, care, lack, of, prevention, and, education, taboo, and, stigma, sexual, behavior, prostitution, and, sexual, violence, against, women, with, a, high, population, of, individuals, living, in, extreme, poverty, condoms, hiv, tests, and, other, forms, of, screening, are, not, prioritized, leaving, many, individuals, lacking, the, necessities, to, protect, themselves, from, the, disease, according, to, the, international, finance, corporation, health, care, in, sub, saharan, africa, remains, the, worst, in, the, world, with, few, countries, able, to, spend, the, 34, to, 40, a, year, per, person, that, the, world, health, organization, considers, the, minimum, for, basic, health, care, notably, though, widespread, poverty, an, astonishing, 50, percent, of, the, region, s, health, expenditure, is, financed, by, out, of, pocket, payments, from, individuals, this, represents, the, lack, of, both, affordability, and, accessibility, surrounding, the, health, care, system, in, sub, saharan, africa, according, to, the, united, nation, sub, saharan, africa, struggles, with, the, highest, rate, of, education, exclusion, in, the, world, 60, of, youth, ages, 15, to, 17, are, not, in, school, with, this, lack, of, education, information, regarding, hiv, aids, and, prevention, practices, are, not, transmitted, to, a, number, of, individuals, leading, to, more, citizens, being, unaware, of, the, severity, of, the, disease, stigma, surrounding, hiv, aids, further, contributes, to, the, high, infection, rate, in, african, villages, an, individual, s, life, is, closely, intertwined, with, their, friends, families, and, neighbors, around, them, individuals, who, have, hiv, aids, are, motivated, to, keep, it, a, secret, in, fear, of, isolation, and, alienation, the, extremity, of, this, stigma, is, conveyed, by, some, of, the, dialogue, people, living, with, hiv, are, often, ridiculed, as, a, walking, corpse, referred, to, as, an, hiv, and, even, called, in, tanzania, nyambizi, or, submarine, which, implies, that, an, hiv, positive, person, is, menacing, and, deadly, sexual, behavior, and, prostitution, also, play, a, part, in, the, increased, rate, of, transmission, of, hiv, aids, in, africa, due, to, the, high, rates, of, poverty, prostitution, is, widespread, and, sexual, partners, are, often, changing, increasing, the, likelihood, of, transmission, africa, has, one, of, the, highest, rates, of, rape, in, the, world, with, many, women, getting, aids, due, to, raped, and, sexual, violence, by, an, hiv, infected, offender, similarly, gender, roles, within, many, african, countries, contribute, to, this, as, in, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, women, are, a, subordinate, group, who, are, expected, to, become, pregnant, bear, children, and, fulfill, the, sexual, desires, of, their, husbands, without, hesitation, fertility, rates, and, contraceptives, in, most, african, countries, the, total, fertility, rate, is, very, high, often, due, to, a, lack, of, access, to, contraception, family, planning, and, practices, such, as, forced, child, marriage, for, instance, niger, angola, mali, burundi, somalia, and, uganda, have, very, high, fertility, rates, according, to, the, united, nations, department, of, economic, and, social, affairs, africa, has, the, lowest, rate, of, contraceptive, use, 33, and, the, highest, rate, of, unmet, need, for, contraceptives, 22, in, mozambique, despite, efforts, in, improving, access, to, modern, contraceptive, methods, the, general, fertility, rate, is, still, high, at, 5, 3, and, the, unmet, need, for, contraceptives, is, also, high, at, 26, among, young, women, the, fertility, rate, has, dramatically, increased, from, 167, births, per, 1000, aged, between, 15, 19, years, in, 2011, to, 194, in, 2015, with, a, large, increase, in, rural, areas, from, 183, to, 230, contraceptive, prevalence, among, 15, 19, years, remains, low, at, 14, in, 2015, when, compared, to, the, national, prevalence, among, the, reproductive, age, group, 15, 49, years, at, 25, in, the, same, year, types, of, contraceptives, the, copper, iud, has, been, provided, less, frequently, than, other, contraceptive, methods, but, there, have, been, signs, of, an, increase, in, most, reported, provinces, the, most, frequently, provided, methods, are, implants, and, injectable, progesterone, which, is, not, as, ideal, as, condom, usage, which, is, still, required, with, this, method, to, decrease, the, risk, of, hiv, in, nigeria, specifically, people, who, have, multiple, partners, are, often, unwilling, to, protect, themselves, with, condoms, in, a, study, conducted, in, a, rural, community, in, south, west, nigeria, in, 1993, it, was, found, that, although, 94, 7, of, 302, candidates, aged, between, 20, and, 54, years, admitted, hearing, about, the, condom, only, 51, 3, admitted, ever, using, it, according, to, the, international, family, planning, perspective, these, injectable, progesterone, products, made, up, 49, of, south, africa, s, contraceptive, use, and, up, to, 90, in, some, provinces, though, contraceptive, use, is, rising, in, african, countries, discontinuation, rates, are, also, high, weak, health, systems, challenge, sub, saharan, african, countries, in, expanding, contraceptive, outreach, promotions, and, service, contraceptive, accessibility, the, updated, contraceptive, guidelines, in, south, africa, attempt, to, improve, accessibility, by, providing, special, service, delivery, and, prompting, awareness, for, adolescents, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, people, disabled, people, chronically, ill, people, women, who, are, perimenopausal, sex, workers, migrants, and, males, they, also, aim, to, increase, access, to, long, acting, contraceptive, methods, such, as, the, copper, iud, the, single, rod, progestogen, implant, combined, with, estrogen, and, progesterone, injectables, tanzanian, provider, perspectives, also, realized, the, biggest, obstacle, in, maintaining, healthy, contraceptive, care, in, their, communities, lack, of, consistency, contraceptive, dispensaries, found, that, the, capability, of, providing, service, to, patients, was, inconsistent, and, substandard, this, resulted, in, unsatisfied, reproductive, goals, low, educational, attainment, miseducation, about, the, side, effects, of, certain, contraceptives, accessibility, has, also, been, hindered, as, a, result, of, inadequate, quantities, of, properly, trained, medical, personnel, according, to, the, african, journal, of, reproductive, health, shortage, of, the, medical, attendant, is, a, challenge, we, are, not, able, to, attend, to, a, big, number, of, clients, also, we, do, not, have, enough, education, which, makes, us, unable, to, provide, women, with, the, methods, they, want, the, majority, of, medical, centers, are, staffed, by, people, without, medical, training, and, few, doctors, and, nurses, despite, federal, regulations, due, to, lack, of, resources, one, center, had, only, one, person, who, was, able, to, insert, and, remove, implants, and, without, her, they, were, unable, to, service, people, who, required, this, method, of, contraceptive, care, another, dispensary, which, carried, two, methods, of, birth, control, shared, that, they, sometimes, run, out, of, both, materials, at, the, same, time, which, makes, it, difficult, to, keep, up, with, the, supply, and, demand, chain, social, factors, effect, on, contraceptives, unbalanced, gender, dynamics, spousal, dynamics, economic, conditions, religious, norms, cultural, norms, and, constraints, in, supply, chains, all, contribute, to, contraceptive, rates, and, usage, one, instance, of, this, is, a, provider, who, referenced, harmful, propaganda, about, the, side, effects, of, contraceptive, usage, the, spread, of, this, propaganda, is, one, of, the, many, examples, of, influential, people, in, the, community, such, as, elders, and, religious, leaders, discouraging, proper, contraceptive, care, health, in, some, cases, influential, members, of, the, community, often, convince, others, that, condoms, and, contraceptive, pills, contain, microorganisms, that, cause, cancer, in, regards, to, spousal, and, gendered, dynamics, many, women, often, have, faced, pressure, from, their, spouse, or, family, members, to, use, avoid, birth, control, which, resulted, in, them, using, it, secretly, this, is, also, one, of, the, many, reasons, women, frequently, preferred, undetectable, contraceptive, methods, which, can, lead, to, less, effective, contraceptives, other, common, sexually, transmitted, infections, in, sub, saharan, africa, sub, saharan, africa, ranks, first, in, sti, yearly, incidence, compared, to, other, world, regions, reiterating, the, major, problem, that, public, health, is, in, african, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, stis, are, the, most, common, reasons, that, individuals, seek, medical, care, according, to, the, world, health, organization, every, year, in, africa, there, are, 3, 5, million, cases, of, syphilis, 15, million, cases, of, chlamydial, disease, 16, million, cases, of, gonorrhea, and, 30, million, cases, of, trichomoniasis, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, women, the, majority, of, hiv, infections, risks, and, other, sexually, transmitted, infections, in, sub, saharan, africa, disproportionately, impact, women, women, particularly, under, the, age, of, 30, account, for, more, than, half, of, new, infections, on, the, african, continent, employing, incidence, rates, that, are, often, double, that, of, their, male, counterparts, not, only, do, women, contain, more, risk, of, infection, but, the, consequences, of, these, diseases, are, often, significantly, worse, for, women, as, they, can, affect, reproductive, health, as, well, some, consequences, of, bacterial, stis, include, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, chronic, pelvic, pain, tubal, infertility, pregnancy, complications, fetal, and, neonatal, death, hiv, infection, is, less, unbalanced, in, gender, infections, but, other, stis, disproportionately, affect, women, who, bear, 80, percent, of, the, disability, previously, stated, women, are, also, more, susceptible, to, infection, due, to, social, stigma, and, gendered, expectations, most, women, with, stds, will, not, seek, medical, care, at, all, or, will, only, present, late, for, treatment, when, complications, have, already, developed, complications, that, have, devastating, physical, psychological, and, social, consequences, particularly, for, women, and, their, children, women, of, lower, income, status, are, often, the, least, likely, subgroup, to, receive, any, sort, of, medical, attention, more, on, lgbtq, health, individuals, who, identify, as, transgender, often, yield, significantly, higher, rates, of, hiv, in, comparison, to, other, subgroups, african, politics, and, government, are, silent, on, lgbtq, issues, in, the, political, sphere, which, translates, in, part, to, their, accessibility, and, prioritization, in, healthcare, it, is, possible, that, the, invisibility, of, transgender, people, in, epidemiological, data, from, africa, is, related, to, the, criminalization, of, same, sex, behaviour, in, many, countries, representative, of, how, traditional, attitudes, shape, one, s, ability, to, participate, similarly, in, society, further, research, conducted, among, transgender, women, in, south, africa, shows, more, health, disparities, and, poor, access, to, appropriate, mental, sexual, and, reproductive, health, services, still, however, there, is, limited, data, concerning, transgender, individuals, within, african, countries, individuals, identifying, as, part, of, the, lgbtq, community, in, a, study, conducted, by, bmc, international, health, and, human, rights, resulted, all, in, facing, some, sort, of, discrimination, by, healthcare, providers, based, on, their, sexual, orientation, and, or, gender, identity, violations, took, four, distinct, forms, availability, accessibility, acceptability, and, quality, facilities, in, south, africa, lack, services, for, specific, lgbt, concerns, providers, refuse, to, care, for, patients, identifying, within, the, community, and, if, did, articulate, moral, disapproval, finally, the, lack, of, quality, and, knowledge, about, lgbtq, identities, and, health, needs, contributes, to, disproportionate, negative, harms, avoiding, or, delaying, seeking, healthcare, with, these, implications, reproductive, health, can, be, impacted, by, exposures, in, the, workplace, both, women, and, men, who, work, during, their, reproductive, years, can, be, exposed, to, a, variety, of, chemical, physical, and, psychosocial, hazards, at, work, that, can, impact, their, fertility, many, women, continue, to, work, while, pregnant, thus, increasing, the, likelihood, that, both, mother, and, baby, could, be, exposed, harmful, substances, can, enter, a, woman, s, body, through, breathing, in, inhalation, contact, with, the, skin, or, swallowing, ingestion, pregnant, workers, and, those, planning, to, become, pregnant, should, be, especially, concerned, about, exposure, to, reproductive, hazards, some, chemicals, such, as, alcohol, can, circulate, in, the, mother, s, blood, pass, through, the, placenta, and, reach, the, developing, fetus, other, hazardous, agents, can, affect, the, overall, health, of, the, woman, and, reduce, the, delivery, of, nutrients, to, the, fetus, radiation, can, pass, directly, through, the, mother, s, body, to, harm, her, eggs, or, the, fetus, some, drugs, and, chemicals, can, also, pass, through, a, mother, s, body, into, the, nursing, baby, through, the, breast, milk, reproductive, hazards, do, not, affect, every, woman, or, every, pregnancy, whether, a, woman, or, her, baby, is, harmed, depends, on, how, much, of, the, hazard, they, are, exposed, to, when, they, are, exposed, how, long, they, are, exposed, how, they, are, exposed, and, personal, factors, like, age, stage, of, menstrual, cycle, stage, of, pregnancy, or, when, exposure, occurs, for, example, exposure, to, a, hazard, could, block, ovulation, and, pregnancy, only, at, specific, times, of, the, menstrual, cycle, exposure, during, the, first, 3, months, of, pregnancy, might, cause, a, birth, defect, or, a, miscarriage, exposure, during, the, last, 6, months, of, pregnancy, could, slow, the, baby, s, growth, affect, its, brain, development, or, cause, premature, labor, workplace, substances, that, affect, female, workers, and, their, pregnancies, can, also, harm, their, families, without, knowing, it, workers, can, bring, home, harmful, substances, that, can, affect, the, health, of, other, family, members, both, adults, and, children, for, example, lead, brought, home, from, the, workplace, on, a, worker, s, skin, hair, clothes, shoes, tool, box, or, car, can, cause, lead, poisoning, in, family, members, especially, young, children, a, number, of, occupational, hazards, can, impact, reproductive, health, and, subsequently, reproductive, outcomes, including, chemical, physical, and, psychosocial, hazards, although, more, than, 1, 000, workplace, chemicals, have, been, shown, to, have, reproductive, effects, on, animals, most, have, not, been, studied, in, humans, in, addition, most, of, the, 4, million, other, chemical, mixtures, in, commercial, use, remain, untested, some, reproductive, hazards, include, many, chemicals, are, not, evaluated, for, reproductive, toxicity, and, occupational, exposure, limits, are, developed, based, on, nonpregnant, adults, exposure, levels, considered, safe, for, an, adult, may, or, may, not, be, safe, for, a, fetus, workplace, hazards, can, lead, to, certain, reproductive, health, problems, such, as, some, workplace, hazards, can, affect, reproductive, health, the, ability, to, become, pregnant, and, the, health, of, unborn, children, most, women, can, safely, keep, working, in, their, job, during, their, pregnancy, but, some, jobs, involve, exposures, that, are, harmful, to, pregnant, or, breastfeeding, women, some, female, health, problems, that, may, be, caused, by, workplace, reproductive, hazards, include, the, following, high, levels, of, physical, or, emotional, stress, or, exposure, to, chemicals, such, as, pesticides, polychlorinated, biphenyls, pcbs, organic, solvents, and, carbon, disulfide, may, disrupt, the, balance, between, the, brain, pituitary, gland, and, ovaries, this, disruption, can, result, in, an, imbalance, of, estrogen, and, progesterone, and, lead, to, changes, in, menstrual, cycle, length, and, regularity, and, ovulation, because, these, sex, hormones, have, effects, throughout, a, woman, s, body, severe, or, long, lasting, hormone, imbalances, may, affect, a, woman, s, overall, health, hazards, that, can, disrupt, the, menstrual, cycle, and, or, sex, hormone, production, include, about, 10, to, 15, of, all, couples, are, infertile, or, have, subfertility, which, means, that, they, are, unable, to, conceive, a, child, after, 1, year, of, trying, to, become, pregnant, many, factors, can, affect, fertility, and, these, factors, can, affect, one, or, both, partners, damage, to, the, woman, s, eggs, or, the, man, s, sperm, or, a, change, in, the, hormones, needed, to, regulate, the, normal, menstrual, cycle, are, just, a, few, things, that, can, cause, problems, with, fertility, more, common, causes, of, infertility, include, infertility, can, be, caused, by, change, in, the, hormones, needed, to, regulate, the, normal, menstrual, cycle, and, uterine, growth, hazards, that, can, reduce, fertility, in, women, include, about, 1, in, every, 6, pregnancies, ends, in, a, miscarriage, the, unplanned, termination, of, a, pregnancy, miscarriages, can, occur, very, early, in, pregnancy, even, before, the, woman, knows, she, is, pregnant, miscarriages, and, stillbirths, occur, for, many, reasons, such, as, the, following, a, birth, defect, is, a, physical, abnormality, present, at, birth, though, it, may, not, be, detected, until, later, about, 2, to, 3, of, babies, are, born, with, a, major, birth, defect, in, most, cases, the, cause, of, the, birth, defect, is, unknown, the, first, 3, months, of, the, pregnancy, is, a, very, sensitive, time, of, development, because, the, internal, organs, and, limbs, are, formed, during, this, period, many, women, are, not, aware, that, they, are, pregnant, during, much, of, this, critical, period, about, 7, of, babies, born, in, the, united, states, are, born, underweight, or, prematurely, poor, maternal, nutrition, smoking, and, alcohol, use, during, pregnancy, are, believed, to, be, responsible, for, most, of, these, cases, although, better, medical, care, has, helped, many, underweight, or, premature, babies, to, develop, and, grow, normally, they, are, more, likely, than, other, babies, to, become, ill, or, even, die, during, their, first, year, of, life, sometimes, the, brain, of, the, fetus, does, not, develop, normally, which, leads, to, developmental, delays, or, learning, disabilities, later, in, life, about, 10, of, children, in, the, united, states, have, some, form, of, developmental, disability, such, problems, are, often, not, noticeable, at, birth, they, can, be, difficult, to, measure, may, be, temporary, or, permanent, and, range, from, mild, to, severe, developmental, problems, may, appear, as, hyperactivity, short, attention, span, reduced, learning, ability, or, in, severe, cases, intellectual, disability, even, if, a, woman, is, not, trying, to, become, pregnant, her, general, health, can, be, harmed, by, reproductive, hazards, that, alter, the, production, of, sex, hormones, sex, hormones, have, effects, throughout, a, woman, s, body, some, workplace, exposures, can, cause, an, imbalance, of, estrogen, and, progesterone, levels, in, the, blood, this, disruption, can, increase, vulnerability, to, a, number, of, workplace,
