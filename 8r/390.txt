genera, data, related, to, black, fly, at, wikispecies, a, black, fly, or, blackfly, sometimes, called, a, buffalo, gnat, turkey, gnat, or, white, socks, is, any, member, of, the, family, simuliidae, of, the, culicomorpha, infraorder, it, is, related, to, the, ceratopogonidae, chironomidae, and, thaumaleidae, over, 2, 200, species, of, black, flies, have, been, formally, named, of, which, 15, are, extinct, they, are, divided, into, two, subfamilies, parasimuliinae, contains, only, one, genus, and, four, species, simuliinae, contains, all, the, rest, over, 1, 800, of, the, species, belong, to, the, genus, simulium, most, black, flies, gain, nourishment, by, feeding, on, the, blood, of, mammals, including, humans, although, the, males, feed, mainly, on, nectar, they, are, usually, small, black, or, gray, with, short, legs, and, antennae, they, are, a, common, nuisance, for, humans, and, many, u, s, states, have, programs, to, suppress, the, black, fly, population, they, spread, several, diseases, including, river, blindness, in, africa, simulium, damnosum, and, s, neavei, and, the, americas, s, callidum, and, s, metallicum, in, central, america, s, ochraceum, in, central, and, south, america, eggs, are, laid, in, running, water, and, the, larvae, attach, themselves, to, rocks, breeding, success, is, highly, sensitive, to, water, pollution, the, larvae, use, tiny, hooks, at, the, ends, of, their, abdomens, to, hold, on, to, the, substrate, using, silk, holdfasts, and, threads, to, move, or, hold, their, place, they, have, foldable, fans, surrounding, their, mouths, also, termed, mouth, brushes, the, fans, expand, when, feeding, catching, passing, debris, small, organic, particles, algae, and, bacteria, the, larva, scrapes, the, fan, s, catch, into, its, mouth, every, few, seconds, black, flies, depend, on, lotic, habitats, to, bring, food, to, them, they, will, pupate, under, water, and, then, emerge, in, a, bubble, of, air, as, flying, adults, they, are, often, preyed, upon, by, trout, during, emergence, the, larva, of, some, south, african, species, are, known, to, be, phoretic, on, mayfly, nymphs, adult, males, feed, on, nectar, while, females, exhibit, anautogeny, and, feed, on, blood, before, laying, eggs, some, species, in, africa, can, range, as, far, as, 40, mi, 64, km, from, aquatic, breeding, sites, in, search, of, their, blood, meals, while, other, species, have, more, limited, ranges, different, species, prefer, different, host, sources, for, their, blood, meals, which, is, sometimes, reflected, in, the, common, name, for, the, species, they, feed, in, the, daytime, preferably, when, wind, speeds, are, low, black, flies, may, be, either, univoltine, or, multivoltine, depending, on, the, species, the, number, of, generations, a, particular, pest, species, has, each, year, tends, to, correlate, with, the, intensity, of, human, efforts, to, control, those, pests, work, conducted, at, portsmouth, university, in, 1986, 1987, indicates, simulium, spp, create, highly, acidic, conditions, within, their, midguts, this, acidic, environment, provides, conditions, ideally, suited, to, bacteria, that, metabolise, cellulose, insects, cannot, metabolise, cellulose, independently, but, the, presence, of, these, bacteria, allows, cellulose, to, be, metabolised, into, basic, sugars, this, provides, nutrition, to, the, black, fly, larvae, as, well, as, the, bacteria, this, symbiotic, relationship, indicates, a, specific, adaptation, as, fresh, flowing, streams, could, not, provide, sufficient, nutrition, to, the, growing, larva, in, any, other, way, only, four, genera, in, the, family, simuliidae, simulium, prosimulium, austrosimulium, and, cnephia, contain, species, that, feed, on, people, though, other, species, prefer, to, feed, on, other, mammals, or, on, birds, simulium, the, type, genus, is, the, most, widespread, and, is, a, vector, for, several, diseases, including, river, blindness, mature, adults, can, disperse, tens, or, hundreds, of, miles, from, their, breeding, grounds, in, fresh, flowing, water, under, their, own, power, and, assisted, by, prevailing, winds, complicating, control, efforts, swarming, behavior, can, make, outdoor, activities, unpleasant, or, intolerable, and, can, affect, livestock, production, during, the, 18th, century, the, golubatz, fly, simulium, colombaschense, was, a, notorious, pest, in, central, europe, even, non, biting, clouds, of, black, flies, whether, composed, of, males, or, of, species, that, do, not, feed, on, humans, or, do, not, require, a, blood, meal, before, egg, laying, can, form, a, nuisance, by, swarming, into, orifices, bites, are, shallow, and, accomplished, by, first, stretching, the, skin, using, teeth, on, the, labrum, and, then, abrading, it, with, the, maxillae, and, mandibles, cutting, the, skin, and, rupturing, its, fine, capillaries, feeding, is, facilitated, by, a, powerful, anticoagulant, in, the, flies, saliva, which, also, partially, numbs, the, site, of, the, bite, reducing, the, host, s, awareness, of, being, bitten, and, thereby, extending, the, flies, feeding, time, biting, flies, feed, during, daylight, hours, only, and, tend, to, zero, in, on, areas, of, thinner, skin, such, as, the, nape, of, the, neck, or, ears, and, ankles, itching, and, localized, swelling, and, inflammation, sometimes, result, from, a, bite, swelling, can, be, quite, pronounced, depending, on, the, species, and, the, individual, s, immune, response, and, irritation, may, persist, for, weeks, intense, feeding, can, cause, black, fly, fever, with, headache, nausea, fever, swollen, lymph, nodes, and, aching, joints, these, symptoms, are, probably, a, reaction, to, a, compound, from, the, flies, salivary, glands, less, common, severe, allergic, reactions, may, require, hospitalization, repellents, provide, some, protection, against, biting, flies, products, containing, the, active, ingredient, ethyl, butylacetylaminopropionate, ir3535, deet, n, n, diethyl, meta, toluamide, or, picaridin, are, most, effective, some, beauty, products, have, been, found, effective, and, their, use, as, insect, repellents, have, been, approved, by, epa, e, g, skin, so, soft, however, given, the, limited, effectiveness, of, repellents, protecting, oneself, against, biting, flies, requires, taking, additional, measures, such, as, avoiding, areas, inhabited, by, the, flies, avoiding, peak, biting, times, and, wearing, heavy, duty, light, colored, clothing, including, long, sleeve, shirts, long, pants, and, hats, when, black, flies, are, numerous, and, unavoidable, netting, that, covers, the, head, like, the, bee, bonnets, used, by, beekeepers, can, provide, protection, black, flies, are, central, to, the, transmission, of, the, parasitic, nematode, onchocerca, volvulus, which, causes, onchocerciasis, or, river, blindness, which, is, endemic, in, parts, of, south, america, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, it, serves, as, the, larval, host, for, the, nematode, and, acts, as, the, vector, by, which, the, disease, is, spread, the, parasite, lives, on, human, skin, and, is, transmitted, to, the, black, fly, during, feeding
