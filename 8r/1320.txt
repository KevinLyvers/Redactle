surgery, is, a, medical, specialty, that, uses, manual, and, instrumental, techniques, to, diagnose, or, treat, pathological, conditions, e, g, trauma, disease, injury, malignancy, to, alter, bodily, functions, e, g, malabsorption, created, by, bariatric, surgery, such, as, gastric, bypass, to, reconstruct, or, improve, aesthetics, and, appearance, cosmetic, surgery, or, to, remove, unwanted, tissues, body, fat, glands, scars, or, skin, tags, or, foreign, bodies, the, subject, receiving, the, surgery, is, typically, a, person, i, e, a, patient, but, can, also, be, a, non, human, animal, i, e, veterinary, surgery, the, act, of, performing, surgery, may, be, called, a, surgical, procedure, or, surgical, operation, or, simply, surgery, or, operation, in, this, context, the, verb, operate, means, to, perform, surgery, the, adjective, surgical, means, pertaining, to, surgery, e, g, surgical, instruments, surgical, facility, or, surgical, nurse, most, surgical, procedures, are, performed, by, a, pair, of, operators, a, surgeon, who, is, the, main, operator, performing, the, surgery, and, a, surgical, assistant, who, provides, in, procedure, manual, assistance, during, surgery, modern, surgical, operations, typically, require, a, surgical, team, that, typically, consists, of, the, surgeon, the, surgical, assistant, an, anaesthetist, often, also, complemented, by, an, anaesthetic, nurse, a, scrub, nurse, who, handles, sterile, equipment, a, circulating, nurse, and, a, surgical, technologist, while, procedures, that, mandate, cardiopulmonary, bypass, will, also, have, a, perfusionist, all, surgical, procedures, are, considered, invasive, and, often, require, a, period, of, postoperative, care, sometimes, intensive, care, for, the, patient, to, recover, from, the, iatrogenic, trauma, inflicted, by, the, procedure, the, duration, of, surgery, can, span, from, several, minutes, to, tens, of, hours, depending, on, the, specialty, the, nature, of, the, condition, the, target, body, parts, involved, and, the, circumstance, of, each, procedure, but, most, surgeries, are, designed, to, be, one, off, interventions, that, are, typically, not, intended, as, an, ongoing, or, repeated, type, of, treatment, in, british, colloquialism, the, term, surgery, can, also, refer, to, the, facility, where, surgery, is, performed, or, simply, the, office, clinic, of, a, physician, dentist, or, veterinarian, as, a, general, rule, a, procedure, is, considered, surgical, when, it, involves, cutting, of, a, person, s, tissues, or, closure, of, a, previously, sustained, wound, other, procedures, that, do, not, necessarily, fall, under, this, rubric, such, as, angioplasty, or, endoscopy, may, be, considered, surgery, if, they, involve, common, surgical, procedure, or, settings, such, as, use, of, antiseptic, measures, and, sterile, fields, sedation, anesthesia, proactive, hemostasis, typical, surgical, instruments, suturing, or, stapling, all, forms, of, surgery, are, considered, invasive, procedures, the, so, called, noninvasive, surgery, ought, to, be, more, appropriately, called, minimally, invasive, procedures, which, usually, refers, to, a, procedure, that, utilizes, natural, orifices, e, g, most, urological, procedures, or, does, not, penetrate, the, structure, being, excised, e, g, endoscopic, polyp, excision, rubber, band, ligation, laser, eye, surgery, are, percutaneous, e, g, arthroscopy, catheter, ablation, angioplasty, and, valvuloplasty, or, to, a, radiosurgical, procedure, e, g, irradiation, of, a, tumor, surgical, procedures, are, commonly, categorized, by, urgency, type, of, procedure, body, system, involved, the, degree, of, invasiveness, and, special, instrumentation, inpatient, surgery, is, performed, in, a, hospital, and, the, person, undergoing, surgery, stays, at, least, one, night, in, the, hospital, after, the, surgery, outpatient, surgery, occurs, in, a, hospital, outpatient, department, or, freestanding, ambulatory, surgery, center, and, the, person, who, had, surgery, is, discharged, the, same, working, day, office, based, surgery, occurs, in, a, physician, s, office, and, the, person, is, discharged, the, same, day, at, a, hospital, modern, surgery, is, often, performed, in, an, operating, theater, using, surgical, instruments, an, operating, table, and, other, equipment, among, united, states, hospitalizations, for, non, maternal, and, non, neonatal, conditions, in, 2012, more, than, one, fourth, of, stays, and, half, of, hospital, costs, involved, stays, that, included, operating, room, or, procedures, the, environment, and, procedures, used, in, surgery, are, governed, by, the, principles, of, aseptic, technique, the, strict, separation, of, sterile, free, of, microorganisms, things, from, unsterile, or, contaminated, things, all, surgical, instruments, must, be, sterilized, and, an, instrument, must, be, replaced, or, re, sterilized, if, it, becomes, contaminated, i, e, handled, in, an, unsterile, manner, or, allowed, to, touch, an, unsterile, surface, operating, room, staff, must, wear, sterile, attire, scrubs, a, scrub, cap, a, sterile, surgical, gown, sterile, latex, or, non, latex, polymer, gloves, and, a, surgical, mask, and, they, must, scrub, hands, and, arms, with, an, approved, disinfectant, agent, before, each, procedure, prior, to, surgery, the, person, is, given, a, medical, examination, receives, certain, pre, operative, tests, and, their, physical, status, is, rated, according, to, the, asa, physical, status, classification, system, if, these, results, are, satisfactory, the, person, requiring, surgery, signs, a, consent, form, and, is, given, a, surgical, clearance, if, the, procedure, is, expected, to, result, in, significant, blood, loss, an, autologous, blood, donation, may, be, made, some, weeks, prior, to, surgery, if, the, surgery, involves, the, digestive, system, the, person, requiring, surgery, may, be, instructed, to, perform, a, bowel, prep, by, drinking, a, solution, of, polyethylene, glycol, the, night, before, the, procedure, people, preparing, for, surgery, are, also, instructed, to, abstain, from, food, or, drink, an, npo, order, after, midnight, on, the, night, before, the, procedure, to, minimize, the, effect, of, stomach, contents, on, pre, operative, medications, and, reduce, the, risk, of, aspiration, if, the, person, vomits, during, or, after, the, procedure, some, medical, systems, have, a, practice, of, routinely, performing, chest, x, rays, before, surgery, the, premise, behind, this, practice, is, that, the, physician, might, discover, some, unknown, medical, condition, which, would, complicate, the, surgery, and, that, upon, discovering, this, with, the, chest, x, ray, the, physician, would, adapt, the, surgery, practice, accordingly, however, medical, specialty, professional, organizations, recommend, against, routine, pre, operative, chest, x, rays, for, people, who, have, an, unremarkable, medical, history, and, presented, with, a, physical, exam, which, did, not, indicate, a, chest, x, ray, routine, x, ray, examination, is, more, likely, to, result, in, problems, like, misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or, other, negative, outcomes, than, it, is, to, result, in, a, benefit, to, the, person, likewise, other, tests, including, complete, blood, count, prothrombin, time, partial, thromboplastin, time, basic, metabolic, panel, and, urinalysis, should, not, be, done, unless, the, results, of, these, tests, can, help, evaluate, surgical, risk, a, surgical, team, may, include, a, surgeon, anesthetist, a, circulating, nurse, and, a, scrub, tech, or, surgical, technician, as, well, as, other, assistants, who, provide, equipment, and, supplies, as, required, while, informed, consent, discussions, may, be, performed, in, a, clinic, or, acute, care, setting, the, pre, operative, holding, area, is, where, documentation, is, reviewed, and, where, family, members, can, also, meet, the, surgical, team, nurses, in, the, preoperative, holding, area, confirm, orders, and, answer, additional, questions, of, the, family, members, of, the, patient, prior, to, surgery, in, the, pre, operative, holding, area, the, person, preparing, for, surgery, changes, out, of, their, street, clothes, and, are, asked, to, confirm, the, details, of, his, or, her, surgery, as, previously, discussed, during, the, process, of, informed, consent, a, set, of, vital, signs, are, recorded, a, peripheral, iv, line, is, placed, and, pre, operative, medications, antibiotics, sedatives, etc, are, given, when, the, patient, enters, the, operating, room, and, is, appropriately, anesthetized, the, team, will, then, position, the, patient, in, an, appropriate, surgical, position, if, hair, is, present, at, the, surgical, site, it, is, clipped, instead, of, shaving, the, skin, surface, within, the, operating, field, is, cleansed, and, prepared, by, applying, an, antiseptic, typically, chlorhexidine, gluconate, in, alcohol, as, this, is, twice, as, effective, as, povidone, iodine, at, reducing, the, risk, of, infection, sterile, drapes, are, then, used, to, cover, the, borders, of, the, operating, field, depending, on, the, type, of, procedure, the, cephalad, drapes, are, secured, to, a, pair, of, poles, near, the, head, of, the, bed, to, form, an, ether, screen, which, separate, the, anesthetist, anesthesiologist, s, working, area, unsterile, from, the, surgical, site, sterile, anesthesia, is, administered, to, prevent, pain, from, the, trauma, of, cutting, tissue, manipulation, application, of, thermal, energy, and, suturing, depending, on, the, type, of, operation, anesthesia, may, be, provided, locally, regionally, or, as, general, anesthesia, spinal, anesthesia, may, be, used, when, the, surgical, site, is, too, large, or, deep, for, a, local, block, but, general, anesthesia, may, not, be, desirable, with, local, and, spinal, anesthesia, the, surgical, site, is, anesthetized, but, the, person, can, remain, conscious, or, minimally, sedated, in, contrast, general, anesthesia, may, render, the, person, unconscious, and, paralyzed, during, surgery, the, person, is, typically, intubated, to, protect, their, airway, and, placed, on, a, mechanical, ventilator, and, anesthesia, is, produced, by, a, combination, of, injected, and, inhaled, agents, the, choice, of, surgical, method, and, anesthetic, technique, aims, to, solve, the, indicated, problem, minimize, the, risk, of, complications, optimize, the, time, needed, for, recovery, and, limit, the, surgical, stress, response, the, intraoperative, phase, begins, when, the, surgery, subject, is, received, in, the, surgical, area, such, as, the, operating, theater, or, surgical, department, and, lasts, until, the, subject, is, transferred, to, a, recovery, area, such, as, a, post, anesthesia, care, unit, an, incision, is, made, to, access, the, surgical, site, blood, vessels, may, be, clamped, or, cauterized, to, prevent, bleeding, and, retractors, may, be, used, to, expose, the, site, or, keep, the, incision, open, the, approach, to, the, surgical, site, may, involve, several, layers, of, incision, and, dissection, as, in, abdominal, surgery, where, the, incision, must, traverse, skin, subcutaneous, tissue, three, layers, of, muscle, and, then, the, peritoneum, in, certain, cases, bone, may, be, cut, to, further, access, the, interior, of, the, body, for, example, cutting, the, skull, for, brain, surgery, or, cutting, the, sternum, for, thoracic, chest, surgery, to, open, up, the, rib, cage, whilst, in, surgery, aseptic, technique, is, used, to, prevent, infection, or, further, spreading, of, the, disease, the, surgeons, and, assistants, hands, wrists, and, forearms, are, washed, thoroughly, for, at, least, 4, minutes, to, prevent, germs, getting, into, the, operative, field, then, sterile, gloves, are, placed, onto, their, hands, an, antiseptic, solution, is, applied, to, the, area, of, the, person, s, body, that, will, be, operated, on, sterile, drapes, are, placed, around, the, operative, site, surgical, masks, are, worn, by, the, surgical, team, to, avoid, germs, on, droplets, of, liquid, from, their, mouths, and, noses, from, contaminating, the, operative, site, work, to, correct, the, problem, in, body, then, proceeds, this, work, may, involve, blood, or, blood, expanders, may, be, administered, to, compensate, for, blood, lost, during, surgery, once, the, procedure, is, complete, sutures, or, staples, are, used, to, close, the, incision, once, the, incision, is, closed, the, anesthetic, agents, are, stopped, or, reversed, and, the, person, is, taken, off, ventilation, and, extubated, if, general, anesthesia, was, administered, after, completion, of, surgery, the, person, is, transferred, to, the, post, anesthesia, care, unit, and, closely, monitored, when, the, person, is, judged, to, have, recovered, from, the, anesthesia, he, she, is, either, transferred, to, a, surgical, ward, elsewhere, in, the, hospital, or, discharged, home, during, the, post, operative, period, the, person, s, general, function, is, assessed, the, outcome, of, the, procedure, is, assessed, and, the, surgical, site, is, checked, for, signs, of, infection, there, are, several, risk, factors, associated, with, postoperative, complications, such, as, immune, deficiency, and, obesity, obesity, has, long, been, considered, a, risk, factor, for, adverse, post, surgical, outcomes, it, has, been, linked, to, many, disorders, such, as, obesity, hypoventilation, syndrome, atelectasis, and, pulmonary, embolism, adverse, cardiovascular, effects, and, wound, healing, complications, if, removable, skin, closures, are, used, they, are, removed, after, 7, to, 10, days, post, operatively, or, after, healing, of, the, incision, is, well, under, way, it, is, not, uncommon, for, surgical, drains, to, be, required, to, remove, blood, or, fluid, from, the, surgical, wound, during, recovery, mostly, these, drains, stay, in, until, the, volume, tapers, off, then, they, are, removed, these, drains, can, become, clogged, leading, to, abscess, postoperative, therapy, may, include, adjuvant, treatment, such, as, chemotherapy, radiation, therapy, or, administration, of, medication, such, as, anti, rejection, medication, for, transplants, for, postoperative, nausea, and, vomiting, ponv, solutions, like, saline, water, controlled, breathing, placebo, and, aromatherapy, can, be, used, in, addition, to, medication, other, follow, up, studies, or, rehabilitation, may, be, prescribed, during, and, after, the, recovery, period, a, recent, post, operative, care, philosophy, has, been, early, ambulation, ambulation, is, getting, the, patient, moving, around, this, can, be, as, simple, as, sitting, up, or, even, walking, around, the, goal, is, to, get, the, patient, moving, as, early, as, possible, it, has, been, found, to, shorten, the, patient, s, length, of, stay, length, of, stay, is, the, amount, of, time, a, patient, spends, in, the, hospital, after, surgery, before, they, are, discharged, in, a, recent, study, done, with, lumbar, decompressions, the, patient, s, length, of, stay, was, decreased, by, 1, 3, days, the, use, of, topical, antibiotics, on, surgical, wounds, to, reduce, infection, rates, has, been, questioned, antibiotic, ointments, are, likely, to, irritate, the, skin, slow, healing, and, could, increase, risk, of, developing, contact, dermatitis, and, antibiotic, resistance, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, topical, antibiotics, should, only, be, used, when, a, person, shows, signs, of, infection, and, not, as, a, preventative, a, systematic, review, published, by, cochrane, organisation, in, 2016, though, concluded, that, topical, antibiotics, applied, over, certain, types, of, surgical, wounds, reduce, the, risk, of, surgical, site, infections, when, compared, to, no, treatment, or, use, of, antiseptics, the, review, also, did, not, find, conclusive, evidence, to, suggest, that, topical, antibiotics, increased, the, risk, of, local, skin, reactions, or, antibiotic, resistance, through, a, retrospective, analysis, of, national, administrative, data, the, association, between, mortality, and, day, of, elective, surgical, procedure, suggests, a, higher, risk, in, procedures, carried, out, later, in, the, working, week, and, on, weekends, the, odds, of, death, were, 44, and, 82, higher, respectively, when, comparing, procedures, on, a, friday, to, a, weekend, procedure, this, weekday, effect, has, been, postulated, to, be, from, several, factors, including, poorer, availability, of, services, on, a, weekend, and, also, decrease, number, and, level, of, experience, over, a, weekend, postoperative, pain, affects, an, estimated, 80, of, people, who, underwent, surgery, while, pain, is, expected, after, surgery, there, is, growing, evidence, that, pain, may, be, inadequately, treated, in, many, people, in, the, acute, period, immediately, after, surgery, it, has, been, reported, that, incidence, of, inadequately, controlled, pain, after, surgery, ranged, from, 25, 1, to, 78, 4, across, all, surgical, disciplines, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, determine, if, giving, opioid, pain, medication, pre, emptively, before, surgery, reduces, postoperative, pain, the, amount, of, medication, needed, after, surgery, postoperative, recovery, has, been, defined, as, an, energy, requiring, process, to, decrease, physical, symptoms, reach, a, level, of, emotional, well, being, regain, functions, and, re, establish, activities, moreover, it, has, been, identified, that, patients, who, have, undergone, surgery, are, often, not, fully, recovered, on, discharge, in, 2011, of, the, 38, 6, million, hospital, stays, in, u, s, hospitals, 29, included, at, least, one, operating, room, procedure, these, stays, accounted, for, 48, of, the, total, 387, billion, in, hospital, costs, the, overall, number, of, procedures, remained, stable, from, 2001, to, 2011, in, 2011, over, 15, million, operating, room, procedures, were, performed, in, u, s, hospitals, data, from, 2003, to, 2011, showed, that, u, s, hospital, costs, were, highest, for, the, surgical, service, line, the, surgical, service, line, costs, were, 17, 600, in, 2003, and, projected, to, be, 22, 500, in, 2013, for, hospital, stays, in, 2012, in, the, united, states, private, insurance, had, the, highest, percentage, of, surgical, expenditure, in, 2012, mean, hospital, costs, in, the, united, states, were, highest, for, surgical, stays, older, adults, have, widely, varying, physical, health, frail, elderly, people, are, at, significant, risk, of, post, surgical, complications, and, the, need, for, extended, care, assessment, of, older, people, before, elective, surgery, can, accurately, predict, the, person, s, recovery, trajectories, one, frailty, scale, uses, five, items, unintentional, weight, loss, muscle, weakness, exhaustion, low, physical, activity, and, slowed, walking, speed, a, healthy, person, scores, 0, a, very, frail, person, scores, 5, compared, to, non, frail, elderly, people, people, with, intermediate, frailty, scores, 2, or, 3, are, twice, as, likely, to, have, post, surgical, complications, spend, 50, more, time, in, the, hospital, and, are, three, times, as, likely, to, be, discharged, to, a, skilled, nursing, facility, instead, of, to, their, own, homes, people, who, are, frail, and, elderly, score, of, 4, or, 5, have, even, worse, outcomes, with, the, risk, of, being, discharged, to, a, nursing, home, rising, to, twenty, times, the, rate, for, non, frail, elderly, people, surgery, on, children, requires, considerations, that, are, not, common, in, adult, surgery, children, and, adolescents, are, still, developing, physically, and, mentally, making, it, difficult, for, them, to, make, informed, decisions, and, give, consent, for, surgical, treatments, bariatric, surgery, in, youth, is, among, the, controversial, topics, related, to, surgery, in, children, doctors, perform, surgery, with, the, consent, of, the, person, undergoing, surgery, some, people, are, able, to, give, better, informed, consent, than, others, populations, such, as, incarcerated, persons, people, living, with, dementia, the, mentally, incompetent, persons, subject, to, coercion, and, other, people, who, are, not, able, to, make, decisions, with, the, same, authority, as, others, have, special, needs, when, making, decisions, about, their, personal, healthcare, including, surgery, global, surgery, has, been, defined, as, the, multidisciplinary, enterprise, of, providing, improved, and, equitable, surgical, care, to, the, world, s, population, with, its, core, belief, as, the, issues, of, need, access, and, quality, halfdan, t, mahler, the, 3rd, director, general, of, the, world, health, organization, who, first, brought, attention, to, the, disparities, in, surgery, and, surgical, care, in, 1980, when, he, stated, in, his, address, to, the, world, congress, of, the, international, college, of, surgeons, the, vast, majority, of, the, world, s, population, has, no, access, whatsoever, to, skilled, surgical, care, and, little, is, being, done, to, find, a, solution, as, such, surgical, care, globally, has, been, described, as, the, neglected, stepchild, of, global, health, a, term, coined, by, paul, farmer, to, highlight, the, urgent, need, for, further, work, in, this, area, furthermore, jim, young, kim, the, former, president, of, the, world, bank, proclaimed, in, 2014, that, surgery, is, an, indivisible, indispensable, part, of, health, care, and, of, progress, towards, universal, health, coverage, in, 2015, the, lancet, commission, on, global, surgery, lcogs, published, the, landmark, report, titled, global, surgery, 2030, evidence, and, solutions, for, achieving, health, welfare, and, economic, development, describing, the, large, pre, existing, burden, of, surgical, diseases, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, lmics, and, future, directions, for, increasing, universal, access, to, safe, surgery, by, the, year, 2030, the, commission, highlighted, that, about, 5, billion, people, lack, access, to, safe, and, affordable, surgical, and, anesthesia, care, and, 143, million, additional, procedures, were, needed, every, year, to, prevent, further, morbidity, and, mortality, from, treatable, surgical, conditions, as, well, as, a, 12, 3, trillion, loss, in, economic, productivity, by, the, year, 2030, this, was, especially, true, in, the, poorest, countries, which, account, for, over, one, third, of, the, population, but, only, 3, 5, of, all, surgeries, that, occur, worldwide, it, emphasized, the, need, to, significantly, improve, the, capacity, for, bellwether, procedures, laparotomy, caesarean, section, open, fracture, care, which, are, considered, a, minimum, level, of, care, that, first, level, hospitals, should, be, able, to, provide, in, order, to, capture, the, most, basic, emergency, surgical, care, in, terms, of, the, financial, impact, on, the, patients, the, lack, of, adequate, surgical, and, anesthesia, care, has, resulted, in, 33, million, individuals, every, year, facing, catastrophic, health, expenditure, the, out, of, pocket, healthcare, cost, exceeding, 40, of, a, given, household, s, income, in, alignment, with, the, lcogs, call, for, action, the, world, health, assembly, adopted, the, resolution, wha68, 15, in, 2015, that, stated, strengthening, emergency, and, essential, surgical, care, and, anesthesia, as, a, component, of, universal, health, coverage, this, not, only, mandated, the, who, to, prioritize, strengthening, the, surgical, and, anesthesia, care, globally, but, also, led, to, governments, of, the, member, states, recognizing, the, urgent, need, for, increasing, capacity, in, surgery, and, anesthesia, additionally, the, third, edition, of, disease, control, priorities, dcp3, published, in, 2015, by, the, world, bank, declared, surgery, as, essential, and, featured, an, entire, volume, dedicated, to, building, surgical, capacity, data, from, who, and, the, world, bank, indicate, that, scaling, up, infrastructure, to, enable, access, to, surgical, care, in, regions, where, it, is, currently, limited, or, is, non, existent, is, a, low, cost, measure, relative, to, the, significant, morbidity, and, mortality, caused, by, lack, of, surgical, treatment, in, fact, a, systematic, review, found, that, the, cost, effectiveness, ratio, dollars, spent, per, dalys, averted, for, surgical, interventions, is, on, par, or, exceeds, those, of, major, public, health, interventions, such, as, oral, rehydration, therapy, breastfeeding, promotion, and, even, hiv, aids, antiretroviral, therapy, this, finding, challenged, the, common, misconception, that, surgical, care, is, financially, prohibitive, endeavor, not, worth, pursuing, in, lmics, a, key, policy, framework, that, arose, from, this, renewed, global, commitment, towards, surgical, care, worldwide, is, the, national, surgical, obstetric, and, anesthesia, plan, nsoap, nsoap, focuses, on, policy, to, action, capacity, building, for, surgical, care, with, tangible, steps, as, follows, 1, analysis, of, baseline, indicators, 2, partnership, with, local, champions, 3, broad, stakeholder, engagement, 4, consensus, building, and, synthesis, of, ideas, 5, language, refinement, 6, costing, 7, dissemination, and, 8, implementation, this, approach, has, been, widely, adopted, and, has, served, as, guiding, principles, between, international, collaborators, and, local, institutions, and, governments, successful, implementations, have, allowed, for, sustainability, in, terms, of, longterm, monitoring, quality, improvement, and, continued, political, and, financial, support, access, to, surgical, care, is, increasingly, recognized, as, an, integral, aspect, of, healthcare, and, therefore, is, evolving, into, a, normative, derivation, of, human, right, to, health, the, icescr, article, 12, 1, and, 12, 2, define, the, human, right, to, health, as, the, right, of, everyone, to, the, enjoyment, of, the, highest, attainable, standard, of, physical, and, mental, health, in, the, august, 2000, the, un, committee, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, cescr, interpreted, this, to, mean, right, to, the, enjoyment, of, a, variety, of, facilities, goods, services, and, conditions, necessary, for, the, realization, of, the, highest, attainable, health, surgical, care, can, be, thereby, viewed, as, a, positive, right, an, entitlement, to, protective, healthcare, woven, through, the, international, human, and, health, rights, literature, is, the, right, to, be, free, from, surgical, disease, the, 1966, icescr, article, 12, 2a, described, the, need, for, provision, for, the, reduction, of, the, stillbirth, rate, and, of, infant, mortality, and, for, the, healthy, development, of, the, child, which, was, subsequently, interpreted, to, mean, requiring, measures, to, improve, emergency, obstetric, services, article, 12, 2d, of, the, icescr, stipulates, the, need, for, the, creation, of, conditions, which, would, assure, to, all, medical, service, and, medical, attention, in, the, event, of, sickness, and, is, interpreted, in, the, 2000, comment, to, include, timely, access, to, basic, preventative, curative, services, for, appropriate, treatment, of, injury, and, disability, obstetric, care, shares, close, ties, with, reproductive, rights, which, includes, access, to, reproductive, health, surgeons, and, public, health, advocates, such, as, kelly, mcqueen, have, described, surgery, as, integral, to, the, right, to, health, this, is, reflected, in, the, establishment, of, the, who, global, initiative, for, emergency, and, essential, surgical, care, in, 2005, the, 2013, formation, of, the, lancet, commission, for, global, surgery, the, 2015, world, bank, publication, of, volume, 1, of, its, disease, control, priorities, project, essential, surgery, and, the, 2015, world, health, assembly, 68, 15, passing, of, the, resolution, for, strengthening, emergency, and, essential, surgical, care, and, anesthesia, as, a, component, of, universal, health, coverage, the, lancet, commission, for, global, surgery, outlined, the, need, for, access, to, available, affordable, timely, and, safe, surgical, and, anesthesia, care, dimensions, paralleled, in, icescr, general, comment, no, 14, which, similarly, outlines, need, for, available, accessible, affordable, and, timely, healthcare, surgical, treatments, date, back, to, the, prehistoric, era, the, oldest, for, which, there, is, evidence, is, trepanation, in, which, a, hole, is, drilled, or, scraped, into, the, skull, thus, exposing, the, dura, mater, in, order, to, treat, health, problems, related, to, intracranial, pressure, prehistoric, surgical, techniques, are, seen, in, ancient, egypt, where, a, mandible, dated, to, approximately, 2650, bc, shows, two, perforations, just, below, the, root, of, the, first, molar, indicating, the, draining, of, an, abscessed, tooth, surgical, texts, from, ancient, egypt, date, back, about, 3500, years, ago, surgical, operations, were, performed, by, priests, specialized, in, medical, treatments, similar, to, today, and, used, sutures, to, close, wounds, infections, were, treated, with, honey, 9, 000, year, old, skeletal, remains, of, a, prehistoric, individual, from, the, indus, river, valley, show, evidence, of, teeth, having, been, drilled, sushruta, samhita, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, surgical, texts, and, its, period, is, usually, placed, in, the, first, millennium, bce, it, describes, in, detail, the, examination, diagnosis, treatment, and, prognosis, of, numerous, ailments, as, well, as, procedures, for, various, forms, of, cosmetic, surgery, plastic, surgery, and, rhinoplasty, in, 1982, archaeologists, were, able, to, find, significant, evidence, when, the, ancient, land, called, alahana, pirivena, situated, in, polonnaruwa, with, ruins, was, excavated, in, that, place, ruins, of, an, ancient, hospital, emerged, the, hospital, building, was, 147, 5, feet, in, width, and, 109, 2, feet, in, length, the, instruments, which, were, used, for, complex, surgeries, were, there, among, the, things, discovered, from, the, place, including, forceps, scissors, probes, lancets, and, scalpels, the, instruments, discovered, may, be, dated, to, 11th, century, ad, in, ancient, greece, temples, dedicated, to, the, healer, god, asclepius, known, as, asclepieia, greek, sing, asclepieion, functioned, as, centers, of, medical, advice, prognosis, and, healing, in, the, asclepieion, of, epidaurus, some, of, the, surgical, cures, listed, such, as, the, opening, of, an, abdominal, abscess, or, the, removal, of, traumatic, foreign, material, are, realistic, enough, to, have, taken, place, the, greek, galen, was, one, of, the, greatest, surgeons, of, the, ancient, world, and, performed, many, audacious, operations, including, brain, and, eye, surgery, that, were, not, tried, again, for, almost, two, millennia, hippocrates, stated, in, the, oath, c, 400, bce, that, general, physicians, must, never, practice, surgery, and, that, surgical, procedures, are, to, be, conducted, by, specialists, researchers, from, the, adelphi, university, discovered, in, the, paliokastro, on, thasos, ten, skeletal, remains, four, women, and, six, men, who, were, buried, between, the, fourth, and, seventh, centuries, a, d, their, bones, illuminated, their, physical, activities, traumas, and, even, a, complex, form, of, brain, surgery, according, to, the, researchers, the, very, serious, trauma, cases, sustained, by, both, males, and, females, had, been, treated, surgically, or, orthopedically, by, a, very, experienced, physician, surgeon, with, great, training, in, trauma, care, we, believe, it, to, have, been, a, military, physician, the, researchers, were, impressed, by, the, complexity, of, the, brain, surgical, operation, in, 1991, at, the, polystylon, fort, in, greece, researchers, discovered, the, head, of, a, byzantine, warrior, of, the, 14th, century, analysis, of, the, lower, jaw, revealed, that, a, surgery, has, been, performed, when, the, warrior, was, alive, to, the, jaw, which, had, been, badly, fractured, and, it, tied, back, together, until, it, healed, during, the, islamic, golden, age, largely, based, upon, paul, of, aegina, s, pragmateia, the, writings, of, albucasis, abu, al, qasim, khalaf, ibn, al, abbas, al, zahrawi, an, andalusian, arab, physician, and, scientist, who, practiced, in, the, zahra, suburb, of, c, rdoba, were, influential, al, zahrawi, specialized, in, curing, disease, by, cauterization, he, invented, several, surgical, instruments, for, purposes, such, as, inspection, of, the, interior, of, the, urethra, and, for, removing, foreign, bodies, from, the, throat, the, ear, and, other, body, organs, he, was, also, the, first, to, illustrate, the, various, cannulae, and, to, treat, warts, with, an, iron, tube, and, caustic, metal, as, a, boring, instrument, he, describes, what, is, thought, to, be, the, first, attempt, at, reduction, mammaplasty, for, the, management, of, gynaecomastia, and, the, first, mastectomy, to, treat, breast, cancer, he, is, credited, with, the, performance, of, the, first, thyroidectomy, al, zahrawi, pioneered, techniques, of, neurosurgery, and, neurological, diagnosis, treating, head, injuries, skull, fractures, spinal, injuries, hydrocephalus, subdural, effusions, and, headache, the, first, clinical, description, of, an, operative, procedure, for, hydrocephalus, was, given, by, al, zahrawi, who, clearly, describes, the, evacuation, of, superficial, intracranial, fluid, in, hydrocephalic, children, in, europe, the, demand, grew, for, surgeons, to, formally, study, for, many, years, before, practicing, universities, such, as, montpellier, padua, and, bologna, were, particularly, renowned, in, the, 12th, century, rogerius, salernitanus, composed, his, chirurgia, laying, the, foundation, for, modern, western, surgical, manuals, barber, surgeons, generally, had, a, bad, reputation, that, was, not, to, improve, until, the, development, of, academic, surgery, as, a, specialty, of, medicine, rather, than, an, accessory, field, basic, surgical, principles, for, asepsis, etc, are, known, as, halsteads, principles, there, were, some, important, advances, to, the, art, of, surgery, during, this, period, the, professor, of, anatomy, at, the, university, of, padua, andreas, vesalius, was, a, pivotal, figure, in, the, renaissance, transition, from, classical, medicine, and, anatomy, based, on, the, works, of, galen, to, an, empirical, approach, of, hands, on, dissection, in, his, anatomic, treaties, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, he, exposed, the, many, anatomical, errors, in, galen, and, advocated, that, all, surgeons, should, train, by, engaging, in, practical, dissections, themselves, the, second, figure, of, importance, in, this, era, was, ambroise, par, sometimes, spelled, ambrose, a, french, army, surgeon, from, the, 1530s, until, his, death, in, 1590, the, practice, for, cauterizing, gunshot, wounds, on, the, battlefield, had, been, to, use, boiling, oil, an, extremely, dangerous, and, painful, procedure, par, began, to, employ, a, less, irritating, emollient, made, of, egg, yolk, rose, oil, and, turpentine, he, also, described, more, efficient, techniques, for, the, effective, ligation, of, the, blood, vessels, during, an, amputation, the, discipline, of, surgery, was, put, on, a, sound, scientific, footing, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, in, europe, an, important, figure, in, this, regard, was, the, scottish, surgical, scientist, john, hunter, generally, regarded, as, the, father, of, modern, scientific, surgery, he, brought, an, empirical, and, experimental, approach, to, the, science, and, was, renowned, around, europe, for, the, quality, of, his, research, and, his, written, works, hunter, reconstructed, surgical, knowledge, from, scratch, refusing, to, rely, on, the, testimonies, of, others, he, conducted, his, own, surgical, experiments, to, determine, the, truth, of, the, matter, to, aid, comparative, analysis, he, built, up, a, collection, of, over, 13, 000, specimens, of, separate, organ, systems, from, the, simplest, plants, and, animals, to, humans, he, greatly, advanced, knowledge, of, venereal, disease, and, introduced, many, new, techniques, of, surgery, including, new, methods, for, repairing, damage, to, the, achilles, tendon, and, a, more, effective, method, for, applying, ligature, of, the, arteries, in, case, of, an, aneurysm, he, was, also, one, of, the, first, to, understand, the, importance, of, pathology, the, danger, of, the, spread, of, infection, and, how, the, problem, of, inflammation, of, the, wound, bone, lesions, and, even, tuberculosis, often, undid, any, benefit, that, was, gained, from, the, intervention, he, consequently, adopted, the, position, that, all, surgical, procedures, should, be, used, only, as, a, last, resort, other, important, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, surgeons, included, percival, pott, 1713, 1788, who, described, tuberculosis, on, the, spine, and, first, demonstrated, that, a, cancer, may, be, caused, by, an, environmental, carcinogen, he, noticed, a, connection, between, chimney, sweep, s, exposure, to, soot, and, their, high, incidence, of, scrotal, cancer, astley, paston, cooper, 1768, 1841, first, performed, a, successful, ligation, of, the, abdominal, aorta, and, james, syme, 1799, 1870, pioneered, the, symes, amputation, for, the, ankle, joint, and, successfully, carried, out, the, first, hip, disarticulation, modern, pain, control, through, anesthesia, was, discovered, in, the, mid, 19th, century, before, the, advent, of, anesthesia, surgery, was, a, traumatically, painful, procedure, and, surgeons, were, encouraged, to, be, as, swift, as, possible, to, minimize, patient, suffering, this, also, meant, that, operations, were, largely, restricted, to, amputations, and, external, growth, removals, beginning, in, the, 1840s, surgery, began, to, change, dramatically, in, character, with, the, discovery, of, effective, and, practical, anaesthetic, chemicals, such, as, ether, first, used, by, the, american, surgeon, crawford, long, and, chloroform, discovered, by, scottish, obstetrician, james, young, simpson, and, later, pioneered, by, john, snow, physician, to, queen, victoria, in, addition, to, relieving, patient, suffering, anaesthesia, allowed, more, intricate, operations, in, the, internal, regions, of, the, human, body, in, addition, the, discovery, of, muscle, relaxants, such, as, curare, allowed, for, safer, applications, the, introduction, of, anesthetics, encouraged, more, surgery, which, inadvertently, caused, more, dangerous, patient, post, operative, infections, the, concept, of, infection, was, unknown, until, relatively, modern, times, the, first, progress, in, combating, infection, was, made, in, 1847, by, the, hungarian, doctor, ignaz, semmelweis, who, noticed, that, medical, students, fresh, from, the, dissecting, room, were, causing, excess, maternal, death, compared, to, midwives, semmelweis, despite, ridicule, and, opposition, introduced, compulsory, handwashing, for, everyone, entering, the, maternal, wards, and, was, rewarded, with, a, plunge, in, maternal, and, fetal, deaths, however, the, royal, society, dismissed, his, advice, until, the, pioneering, work, of, british, surgeon, joseph, lister, in, the, 1860s, most, medical, men, believed, that, chemical, damage, from, exposures, to, bad, air, see, miasma, was, responsible, for, infections, in, wounds, and, facilities, for, washing, hands, or, a, patient, s, wounds, were, not, available, lister, became, aware, of, the, work, of, french, chemist, louis, pasteur, who, showed, that, rotting, and, fermentation, could, occur, under, anaerobic, conditions, if, micro, organisms, were, present, pasteur, suggested, three, methods, to, eliminate, the, micro, organisms, responsible, for, gangrene, filtration, exposure, to, heat, or, exposure, to, chemical, solutions, lister, confirmed, pasteur, s, conclusions, with, his, own, experiments, and, decided, to, use, his, findings, to, develop, antiseptic, techniques, for, wounds, as, the, first, two, methods, suggested, by, pasteur, were, inappropriate, for, the, treatment, of, human, tissue, lister, experimented, with, the, third, spraying, carbolic, acid, on, his, instruments, he, found, that, this, remarkably, reduced, the, incidence, of, gangrene, and, he, published, his, results, in, the, lancet, later, on, 9, august, 1867, he, read, a, paper, before, the, british, medical, association, in, dublin, on, the, antiseptic, principle, of, the, practice, of, surgery, which, was, reprinted, in, the, british, medical, journal, his, work, was, groundbreaking, and, laid, the, foundations, for, a, rapid, advance, in, infection, control, that, saw, modern, antiseptic, operating, theatres, widely, used, within, 50, years, lister, continued, to, develop, improved, methods, of, antisepsis, and, asepsis, when, he, realised, that, infection, could, be, better, avoided, by, preventing, bacteria, from, getting, into, wounds, in, the, first, place, this, led, to, the, rise, of, sterile, surgery, lister, introduced, the, steam, steriliser, to, sterilize, equipment, instituted, rigorous, hand, washing, and, later, implemented, the, wearing, of, rubber, gloves, these, three, crucial, advances, the, adoption, of, a, scientific, methodology, toward, surgical, operations, the, use, of, anaesthetic, and, the, introduction, of, sterilised, equipment, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, modern, invasive, surgical, techniques, of, today, the, use, of, x, rays, as, an, important, medical, diagnostic, tool, began, with, their, discovery, in, 1895, by, german, physicist, wilhelm, r, ntgen, he, noticed, that, these, rays, could, penetrate, the, skin, allowing, the, skeletal, structure, to, be, captured, on, a, specially, treated, photographic, plate
