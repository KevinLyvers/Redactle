the, spinal, cord, is, a, long, thin, tubular, structure, made, up, of, nervous, tissue, that, extends, from, the, medulla, oblongata, in, the, brainstem, to, the, lumbar, region, of, the, vertebral, column, backbone, of, vertebrate, animals, the, center, of, the, spinal, cord, is, hollow, and, contains, a, structure, called, the, central, canal, which, contains, cerebrospinal, fluid, the, spinal, cord, is, also, covered, by, meninges, and, enclosed, by, the, neural, arches, together, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, make, up, the, central, nervous, system, in, humans, the, spinal, cord, is, a, continuation, of, the, brainstem, and, anatomically, begins, at, the, occipital, bone, passing, out, of, the, foramen, magnum, and, then, enters, the, spinal, canal, at, the, beginning, of, the, cervical, vertebrae, the, spinal, cord, extends, down, to, between, the, first, and, second, lumbar, vertebrae, where, it, tapers, to, become, the, caudal, equina, the, enclosing, bony, vertebral, column, protects, the, relatively, shorter, spinal, cord, it, is, around, 45, cm, 18, in, long, in, adult, men, and, around, 43, cm, 17, in, long, in, adult, women, the, diameter, of, the, spinal, cord, ranges, from, 13, mm, 1, 2, in, in, the, cervical, and, lumbar, regions, to, 6, 4, mm, 1, 4, in, in, the, thoracic, area, the, spinal, cord, functions, primarily, in, the, transmission, of, nerve, signals, from, the, motor, cortex, to, the, body, and, from, the, afferent, fibers, of, the, sensory, neurons, to, the, sensory, cortex, it, is, also, a, center, for, coordinating, many, reflexes, and, contains, reflex, arcs, that, can, independently, control, reflexes, it, is, also, the, location, of, groups, of, spinal, interneurons, that, make, up, the, neural, circuits, known, as, central, pattern, generators, these, circuits, are, responsible, for, controlling, motor, instructions, for, rhythmic, movements, such, as, walking, the, spinal, cord, is, the, main, pathway, for, information, connecting, the, brain, and, peripheral, nervous, system, much, shorter, than, its, protecting, spinal, column, the, human, spinal, cord, originates, in, the, brainstem, passes, through, the, foramen, magnum, and, continues, through, to, the, conus, medullaris, near, the, second, lumbar, vertebra, before, terminating, in, a, fibrous, extension, known, as, the, filum, terminale, it, is, about, 45, centimetres, 18, inches, long, in, males, and, about, 43, cm, 17, in, in, females, ovoid, shaped, and, is, enlarged, in, the, cervical, and, lumbar, regions, the, cervical, enlargement, stretching, from, the, c4, to, t1, vertebrae, is, where, sensory, input, comes, from, and, motor, output, goes, to, the, arms, and, trunk, the, lumbar, enlargement, located, between, t10, and, l1, handles, sensory, input, and, motor, output, coming, from, and, going, to, the, legs, the, spinal, cord, is, continuous, with, the, caudal, portion, of, the, medulla, running, from, the, base, of, the, skull, to, the, body, of, the, first, lumbar, vertebra, it, does, not, run, the, full, length, of, the, vertebral, column, in, adults, it, is, made, of, 31, segments, from, which, branch, one, pair, of, sensory, nerve, roots, and, one, pair, of, motor, nerve, roots, the, nerve, roots, then, merge, into, bilaterally, symmetrical, pairs, of, spinal, nerves, the, peripheral, nervous, system, is, made, up, of, these, spinal, roots, nerves, and, ganglia, the, dorsal, roots, are, afferent, fascicles, receiving, sensory, information, from, the, skin, muscles, and, visceral, organs, to, be, relayed, to, the, brain, the, roots, terminate, in, dorsal, root, ganglia, which, are, composed, of, the, cell, bodies, of, the, corresponding, neurons, ventral, roots, consist, of, efferent, fibers, that, arise, from, motor, neurons, whose, cell, bodies, are, found, in, the, ventral, or, anterior, gray, horns, of, the, spinal, cord, the, spinal, cord, and, brain, are, protected, by, three, layers, of, tissue, or, membranes, called, meninges, that, surround, the, canal, the, dura, mater, is, the, outermost, layer, and, it, forms, a, tough, protective, coating, between, the, dura, mater, and, the, surrounding, bone, of, the, vertebrae, is, a, space, called, the, epidural, space, the, epidural, space, is, filled, with, adipose, tissue, and, it, contains, a, network, of, blood, vessels, the, arachnoid, mater, the, middle, protective, layer, is, named, for, its, open, spiderweb, like, appearance, the, space, between, the, arachnoid, and, the, underlying, pia, mater, is, called, the, subarachnoid, space, the, subarachnoid, space, contains, cerebrospinal, fluid, which, can, be, sampled, with, a, lumbar, puncture, or, spinal, tap, procedure, the, delicate, pia, mater, the, innermost, protective, layer, is, tightly, associated, with, the, surface, of, the, spinal, cord, the, cord, is, stabilized, within, the, dura, mater, by, the, connecting, denticulate, ligaments, which, extend, from, the, enveloping, pia, mater, laterally, between, the, dorsal, and, ventral, roots, the, dural, sac, ends, at, the, vertebral, level, of, the, second, sacral, vertebra, in, cross, section, the, peripheral, region, of, the, cord, contains, neuronal, white, matter, tracts, containing, sensory, and, motor, axons, internal, to, this, peripheral, region, is, the, grey, matter, which, contains, the, nerve, cell, bodies, arranged, in, the, three, grey, columns, that, give, the, region, its, butterfly, shape, this, central, region, surrounds, the, central, canal, which, is, an, extension, of, the, fourth, ventricle, and, contains, cerebrospinal, fluid, the, spinal, cord, is, elliptical, in, cross, section, being, compressed, dorsolaterally, two, prominent, grooves, or, sulci, run, along, its, length, the, posterior, median, sulcus, is, the, groove, in, the, dorsal, side, and, the, anterior, median, fissure, is, the, groove, in, the, ventral, side, the, human, spinal, cord, is, divided, into, segments, where, pairs, of, spinal, nerves, mixed, sensory, and, motor, form, six, to, eight, motor, nerve, rootlets, branch, out, of, right, and, left, ventralateral, sulci, in, a, very, orderly, manner, nerve, rootlets, combine, to, form, nerve, roots, likewise, sensory, nerve, rootlets, form, off, right, and, left, dorsal, lateral, sulci, and, form, sensory, nerve, roots, the, ventral, motor, and, dorsal, sensory, roots, combine, to, form, spinal, nerves, mixed, motor, and, sensory, one, on, each, side, of, the, spinal, cord, spinal, nerves, with, the, exception, of, c1, and, c2, form, inside, the, intervertebral, foramen, these, rootlets, form, the, demarcation, between, the, central, and, peripheral, nervous, systems, generally, the, spinal, cord, segments, do, not, correspond, to, bony, vertebra, levels, as, the, spinal, cord, terminates, at, the, l1, l2, level, other, segments, of, the, spinal, cord, would, be, positioned, superior, to, their, corresponding, bony, vertebral, body, for, example, the, t11, spinal, segment, is, located, higher, than, the, t11, bony, vertebra, and, the, sacral, spinal, cord, segment, is, higher, than, the, l1, vertebral, body, the, grey, columns, three, regions, of, grey, matter, in, the, center, of, the, cord, is, shaped, like, a, butterfly, and, consists, of, cell, bodies, of, interneurons, motor, neurons, neuroglia, cells, and, unmyelinated, axons, the, anterior, and, posterior, grey, columns, present, as, projections, of, grey, matter, and, are, also, known, as, the, horns, of, the, spinal, cord, the, white, matter, is, located, outside, of, the, grey, matter, and, consists, almost, totally, of, myelinated, motor, and, sensory, axons, columns, of, white, matter, known, as, funiculi, carry, information, either, up, or, down, the, spinal, cord, the, spinal, cord, proper, terminates, in, a, region, called, the, conus, medullaris, while, the, pia, mater, continues, as, an, extension, called, the, filum, terminale, which, anchors, the, spinal, cord, to, the, coccyx, the, cauda, equina, horse, s, tail, is, a, collection, of, nerves, inferior, to, the, conus, medullaris, that, continue, to, travel, through, the, vertebral, column, to, the, coccyx, the, cauda, equina, forms, because, the, spinal, cord, stops, growing, in, length, at, about, age, four, even, though, the, vertebral, column, continues, to, lengthen, until, adulthood, this, results, in, sacral, spinal, nerves, originating, in, the, upper, lumbar, region, for, that, reason, the, spinal, cord, occupies, only, two, thirds, of, the, vertebral, canal, the, inferior, part, of, the, vertebral, canal, is, filled, with, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, the, space, is, called, the, lumbar, cistern, within, the, central, nervous, system, cns, nerve, cell, bodies, are, generally, organized, into, functional, clusters, called, nuclei, their, axons, are, grouped, into, tracts, there, are, 31, spinal, cord, nerve, segments, in, a, human, spinal, cord, in, the, fetus, vertebral, segments, correspond, with, spinal, cord, segments, however, because, the, vertebral, column, grows, longer, than, the, spinal, cord, spinal, cord, segments, do, not, correspond, to, vertebral, segments, in, the, adult, particularly, in, the, lower, spinal, cord, for, example, lumbar, and, sacral, spinal, cord, segments, are, found, between, vertebral, levels, t9, and, l2, and, the, spinal, cord, ends, around, the, l1, l2, vertebral, level, forming, a, structure, known, as, the, conus, medullaris, although, the, spinal, cord, cell, bodies, end, around, the, l1, l2, vertebral, level, the, spinal, nerves, for, each, segment, exit, at, the, level, of, the, corresponding, vertebra, for, the, nerves, of, the, lower, spinal, cord, this, means, that, they, exit, the, vertebral, column, much, lower, more, caudally, than, their, roots, as, these, nerves, travel, from, their, respective, roots, to, their, point, of, exit, from, the, vertebral, column, the, nerves, of, the, lower, spinal, segments, form, a, bundle, called, the, cauda, equina, there, are, two, regions, where, the, spinal, cord, enlarges, the, spinal, cord, is, made, from, part, of, the, neural, tube, during, development, there, are, four, stages, of, the, spinal, cord, that, arises, from, the, neural, tube, the, neural, plate, neural, fold, neural, tube, and, the, spinal, cord, neural, differentiation, occurs, within, the, spinal, cord, portion, of, the, tube, as, the, neural, tube, begins, to, develop, the, notochord, begins, to, secrete, a, factor, known, as, sonic, hedgehog, shh, as, a, result, the, floor, plate, then, also, begins, to, secrete, shh, and, this, will, induce, the, basal, plate, to, develop, motor, neurons, during, the, maturation, of, the, neural, tube, its, lateral, walls, thicken, and, form, a, longitudinal, groove, called, the, sulcus, limitans, this, extends, the, length, of, the, spinal, cord, into, dorsal, and, ventral, portions, as, well, meanwhile, the, overlying, ectoderm, secretes, bone, morphogenetic, protein, bmp, this, induces, the, roof, plate, to, begin, to, secrete, bmp, which, will, induce, the, alar, plate, to, develop, sensory, neurons, opposing, gradients, of, such, morphogens, as, bmp, and, shh, form, different, domains, of, dividing, cells, along, the, dorsal, ventral, axis, dorsal, root, ganglion, neurons, differentiate, from, neural, crest, progenitors, as, the, dorsal, and, ventral, column, cells, proliferate, the, lumen, of, the, neural, tube, narrows, to, form, the, small, central, canal, of, the, spinal, cord, the, alar, plate, and, the, basal, plate, are, separated, by, the, sulcus, limitans, additionally, the, floor, plate, also, secretes, netrins, the, netrins, act, as, chemoattractants, to, decussation, of, pain, and, temperature, sensory, neurons, in, the, alar, plate, across, the, anterior, white, commissure, where, they, then, ascend, towards, the, thalamus, following, the, closure, of, the, caudal, neuropore, and, formation, of, the, brain, s, ventricles, that, contain, the, choroid, plexus, tissue, the, central, canal, of, the, caudal, spinal, cord, is, filled, with, cerebrospinal, fluid, earlier, findings, by, viktor, hamburger, and, rita, levi, montalcini, in, the, chick, embryo, have, been, confirmed, by, more, recent, studies, which, have, demonstrated, that, the, elimination, of, neuronal, cells, by, programmed, cell, death, is, necessary, for, the, correct, assembly, of, the, nervous, system, overall, spontaneous, embryonic, activity, has, been, shown, to, play, a, role, in, neuron, and, muscle, development, but, is, probably, not, involved, in, the, initial, formation, of, connections, between, spinal, neurons, the, spinal, cord, is, supplied, with, blood, by, three, arteries, that, run, along, its, length, starting, in, the, brain, and, many, arteries, that, approach, it, through, the, sides, of, the, spinal, column, the, three, longitudinal, arteries, are, the, anterior, spinal, artery, and, the, right, and, left, posterior, spinal, arteries, these, travel, in, the, subarachnoid, space, and, send, branches, into, the, spinal, cord, they, form, anastomoses, connections, via, the, anterior, and, posterior, segmental, medullary, arteries, which, enter, the, spinal, cord, at, various, points, along, its, length, the, actual, blood, flow, caudally, through, these, arteries, derived, from, the, posterior, cerebral, circulation, is, inadequate, to, maintain, the, spinal, cord, beyond, the, cervical, segments, the, major, contribution, to, the, arterial, blood, supply, of, the, spinal, cord, below, the, cervical, region, comes, from, the, radially, arranged, posterior, and, anterior, radicular, arteries, which, run, into, the, spinal, cord, alongside, the, dorsal, and, ventral, nerve, roots, but, with, one, exception, do, not, connect, directly, with, any, of, the, three, longitudinal, arteries, these, intercostal, and, lumbar, radicular, arteries, arise, from, the, aorta, provide, major, anastomoses, and, supplement, the, blood, flow, to, the, spinal, cord, in, humans, the, largest, of, the, anterior, radicular, arteries, is, known, as, the, artery, of, adamkiewicz, or, anterior, radicularis, magna, arm, artery, which, usually, arises, between, l1, and, l2, but, can, arise, anywhere, from, t9, to, l5, impaired, blood, flow, through, these, critical, radicular, arteries, especially, during, surgical, procedures, that, involve, abrupt, disruption, of, blood, flow, through, the, aorta, for, example, during, aortic, aneurysm, repair, can, result, in, spinal, cord, infarction, and, paraplegia, the, spinal, cord, mainly, functions, to, carry, information, to, and, from, the, brain, in, ascending, and, descending, tracts, there, are, two, ascending, somatosensory, pathways, in, the, spinal, cord, the, dorsal, column, medial, lemniscus, pathway, dcml, pathway, and, the, anterolateral, system, als, in, the, dorsal, column, medial, lemniscus, pathway, a, primary, neuron, s, axon, enters, the, spinal, cord, and, then, enters, the, dorsal, column, here, the, dorsal, column, connects, to, the, axon, of, the, nerve, cell, if, the, primary, axon, enters, below, spinal, level, t6, the, axon, travels, in, the, gracile, fasciculus, the, medial, part, of, the, column, if, the, axon, enters, above, level, t6, then, it, travels, in, the, cuneate, fasciculus, which, is, lateral, to, the, fasciculus, gracilis, either, way, the, primary, axon, ascends, to, the, lower, medulla, where, it, leaves, its, fasciculus, and, synapses, with, a, secondary, neuron, in, one, of, the, dorsal, column, nuclei, either, the, nucleus, gracilis, or, the, nucleus, cuneatus, depending, on, the, pathway, it, took, at, this, point, the, secondary, axon, leaves, its, nucleus, and, passes, anteriorly, and, medially, the, collection, of, secondary, axons, that, do, this, are, known, as, internal, arcuate, fibers, the, internal, arcuate, fibers, decussate, and, continue, ascending, as, the, contralateral, medial, lemniscus, secondary, axons, from, the, medial, lemniscus, finally, terminate, in, the, ventral, posterolateral, nucleus, vpln, of, the, thalamus, where, they, synapse, with, tertiary, neurons, from, there, tertiary, neurons, ascend, via, the, posterior, limb, of, the, internal, capsule, and, end, in, the, primary, sensory, cortex, the, proprioception, of, the, lower, limbs, differs, from, the, upper, limbs, and, upper, trunk, there, is, a, four, neuron, pathway, for, lower, limb, proprioception, this, pathway, initially, follows, the, dorsal, spino, cerebellar, pathway, it, is, arranged, as, follows, proprioceptive, receptors, of, lower, limb, peripheral, process, dorsal, root, ganglion, central, process, clarke, s, column, 2nd, order, neuron, spinocerebellar, tract, cerebellum, the, anterolateral, system, als, works, somewhat, differently, its, primary, neurons, axons, enter, the, spinal, cord, and, then, ascend, one, to, two, levels, before, synapsing, in, the, substantia, gelatinosa, the, tract, that, ascends, before, synapsing, is, known, as, lissauer, s, tract, after, synapsing, secondary, axons, decussate, and, ascend, in, the, anterior, lateral, portion, of, the, spinal, cord, as, the, spinothalamic, tract, this, tract, ascends, all, the, way, to, the, vpln, where, it, synapses, on, tertiary, neurons, tertiary, neuronal, axons, then, travel, to, the, primary, sensory, cortex, via, the, posterior, limb, of, the, internal, capsule, some, of, the, pain, fibers, in, the, als, deviate, from, their, pathway, towards, the, vpln, in, one, such, deviation, axons, travel, towards, the, reticular, formation, in, the, midbrain, the, reticular, formation, then, projects, to, a, number, of, places, including, the, hippocampus, to, create, memories, about, the, pain, the, centromedian, nucleus, to, cause, diffuse, non, specific, pain, and, various, parts, of, the, cortex, additionally, some, als, axons, from, the, spinomesencephalic, pathway, project, to, the, periaqueductal, gray, in, the, pons, and, the, axons, forming, the, periaqueductal, gray, then, project, to, the, nucleus, raphes, magnus, which, projects, back, down, to, where, the, pain, signal, is, coming, from, and, inhibits, it, this, helps, control, the, sensation, of, pain, to, some, degree, proprioceptive, information, in, the, body, travels, up, the, spinal, cord, via, three, tracks, below, l2, the, proprioceptive, information, travels, up, the, spinal, cord, in, the, ventral, spinocerebellar, tract, also, known, as, the, anterior, spinocerebellar, tract, sensory, receptors, take, in, the, information, and, travel, into, the, spinal, cord, the, cell, bodies, of, these, primary, neurons, are, located, in, the, dorsal, root, ganglia, in, the, spinal, cord, the, axons, synapse, and, the, secondary, neuronal, axons, decussates, and, then, travel, up, to, the, superior, cerebellar, peduncle, where, they, decussate, again, from, here, the, information, is, brought, to, deep, nuclei, of, the, cerebellum, including, the, fastigial, and, interposed, nuclei, from, the, levels, of, l2, to, t1, proprioceptive, information, enters, the, spinal, cord, and, ascends, ipsilaterally, where, it, synapses, in, clarke, s, nucleus, the, secondary, neuronal, axons, continue, to, ascend, ipsilaterally, and, then, pass, into, the, cerebellum, via, the, inferior, cerebellar, peduncle, this, tract, is, known, as, the, dorsal, spinocerebellar, tract, from, above, t1, proprioceptive, primary, axons, enter, the, spinal, cord, and, ascend, ipsilaterally, until, reaching, the, accessory, cuneate, nucleus, where, they, synapse, the, secondary, axons, pass, into, the, cerebellum, via, the, inferior, cerebellar, peduncle, where, again, these, axons, synapse, on, cerebellar, deep, nuclei, this, tract, is, known, as, the, cuneocerebellar, tract, the, descending, tracts, are, of, motor, information, descending, tracts, involve, two, neurons, the, upper, motor, neuron, and, lower, motor, neuron, a, nerve, signal, travels, down, the, upper, motor, neuron, until, it, synapses, with, the, lower, motor, neuron, in, the, spinal, cord, then, the, lower, motor, neuron, conducts, the, nerve, signal, to, the, spinal, root, where, efferent, nerve, fibers, carry, the, motor, signal, toward, the, target, muscle, the, descending, tracts, are, composed, of, white, matter, there, are, several, descending, tracts, serving, different, functions, the, corticospinal, tracts, lateral, and, anterior, are, responsible, for, coordinated, limb, movements, the, corticospinal, tract, serves, as, the, motor, pathway, for, upper, motor, neuronal, signals, coming, from, the, cerebral, cortex, and, from, primitive, brainstem, motor, nuclei, cortical, upper, motor, neurons, originate, from, brodmann, areas, 1, 2, 3, 4, and, 6, and, then, descend, in, the, posterior, limb, of, the, internal, capsule, through, the, crus, cerebri, down, through, the, pons, and, to, the, medullary, pyramids, where, about, 90, of, the, axons, cross, to, the, contralateral, side, at, the, decussation, of, the, pyramids, they, then, descend, as, the, lateral, corticospinal, tract, these, axons, synapse, with, lower, motor, neurons, in, the, ventral, horns, of, all, levels, of, the, spinal, cord, the, remaining, 10, of, axons, descend, on, the, ipsilateral, side, as, the, ventral, corticospinal, tract, these, axons, also, synapse, with, lower, motor, neurons, in, the, ventral, horns, most, of, them, will, cross, to, the, contralateral, side, of, the, cord, via, the, anterior, white, commissure, right, before, synapsing, the, midbrain, nuclei, include, four, motor, tracts, that, send, upper, motor, neuronal, axons, down, the, spinal, cord, to, lower, motor, neurons, these, are, the, rubrospinal, tract, the, vestibulospinal, tract, the, tectospinal, tract, and, the, reticulospinal, tract, the, rubrospinal, tract, descends, with, the, lateral, corticospinal, tract, and, the, remaining, three, descend, with, the, anterior, corticospinal, tract, the, function, of, lower, motor, neurons, can, be, divided, into, two, different, groups, the, lateral, corticospinal, tract, and, the, anterior, cortical, spinal, tract, the, lateral, tract, contains, upper, motor, neuronal, axons, which, synapse, on, dorsal, lateral, dl, lower, motor, neurons, the, dl, neurons, are, involved, in, distal, limb, control, therefore, these, dl, neurons, are, found, specifically, only, in, the, cervical, and, lumbosacral, enlargements, within, the, spinal, cord, there, is, no, decussation, in, the, lateral, corticospinal, tract, after, the, decussation, at, the, medullary, pyramids, the, anterior, corticospinal, tract, descends, ipsilaterally, in, the, anterior, column, where, the, axons, emerge, and, either, synapse, on, lower, ventromedial, vm, motor, neurons, in, the, ventral, horn, ipsilaterally, or, descussate, at, the, anterior, white, commissure, where, they, synapse, on, vm, lower, motor, neurons, contralaterally, the, tectospinal, vestibulospinal, and, reticulospinal, descend, ipsilaterally, in, the, anterior, column, but, do, not, synapse, across, the, anterior, white, commissure, rather, they, only, synapse, on, vm, lower, motor, neurons, ipsilaterally, the, vm, lower, motor, neurons, control, the, large, postural, muscles, of, the, axial, skeleton, these, lower, motor, neurons, unlike, those, of, the, dl, are, located, in, the, ventral, horn, all, the, way, throughout, the, spinal, cord, the, spinal, cord, is, a, center, for, coordinating, many, reflexes, and, contains, reflex, arcs, that, can, independently, control, reflexes, it, is, also, the, location, of, groups, of, spinal, interneurons, that, make, up, the, neural, circuits, known, as, central, pattern, generators, these, circuits, are, responsible, for, controlling, motor, instructions, for, rhythmic, movements, such, as, walking, a, congenital, disorder, is, diastematomyelia, in, which, part, of, the, spinal, cord, is, split, usually, at, the, level, of, the, upper, lumbar, vertebrae, sometimes, the, split, can, be, along, the, length, of, the, spinal, cord, spinal, cord, injuries, can, be, caused, by, trauma, to, the, spinal, column, stretching, bruising, applying, pressure, severing, laceration, etc, the, vertebral, bones, or, intervertebral, disks, can, shatter, causing, the, spinal, cord, to, be, punctured, by, a, sharp, fragment, of, bone, usually, victims, of, spinal, cord, injuries, will, suffer, loss, of, feeling, in, certain, parts, of, their, body, in, milder, cases, a, victim, might, only, suffer, loss, of, hand, or, foot, function, more, severe, injuries, may, result, in, paraplegia, tetraplegia, also, known, as, quadriplegia, or, full, body, paralysis, below, the, site, of, injury, to, the, spinal, cord, damage, to, upper, motor, neuron, axons, in, the, spinal, cord, results, in, a, characteristic, pattern, of, ipsilateral, deficits, these, include, hyperreflexia, hypertonia, and, muscle, weakness, lower, motor, neuronal, damage, results, in, its, own, characteristic, pattern, of, deficits, rather, than, an, entire, side, of, deficits, there, is, a, pattern, relating, to, the, myotome, affected, by, the, damage, additionally, lower, motor, neurons, are, characterized, by, muscle, weakness, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, and, muscle, atrophy, spinal, shock, and, neurogenic, shock, can, occur, from, a, spinal, injury, spinal, shock, is, usually, temporary, lasting, only, for, 24, 48, hours, and, is, a, temporary, absence, of, sensory, and, motor, functions, neurogenic, shock, lasts, for, weeks, and, can, lead, to, a, loss, of, muscle, tone, due, to, disuse, of, the, muscles, below, the, injured, site, the, two, areas, of, the, spinal, cord, most, commonly, injured, are, the, cervical, spine, c1, c7, and, the, lumbar, spine, l1, l5, the, notation, c1, c7, l1, l5, refer, to, the, location, of, a, specific, vertebra, in, either, the, cervical, thoracic, or, lumbar, region, of, the, spine, spinal, cord, injury, can, also, be, non, traumatic, and, caused, by, disease,
