cnidaria, n, d, r, i, n, a, nih, dair, ee, ny, is, a, phylum, under, kingdom, animalia, containing, over, 11, 000, species, of, aquatic, animals, found, both, in, fresh, water, and, marine, environments, predominantly, the, latter, including, jellyfish, hydroids, sea, anemones, corals, and, some, of, the, smallest, marine, parasites, their, distinguishing, features, are, a, decentralized, nervous, system, distributed, throughout, a, gelatinous, body, and, the, presence, of, cnidocytes, or, cnidoblasts, specialized, cells, with, ejectable, flagella, used, mainly, for, envenomation, and, capturing, prey, their, bodies, consist, of, mesoglea, a, non, living, jelly, like, substance, sandwiched, between, two, layers, of, epithelium, that, are, mostly, one, cell, thick, cnidarians, are, also, some, of, the, only, animals, that, can, reproduce, both, sexually, and, asexually, cnidarians, mostly, have, two, basic, body, forms, swimming, medusae, and, sessile, polyps, both, of, which, are, radially, symmetrical, with, mouths, surrounded, by, tentacles, that, bear, cnidocytes, which, are, specialized, stinging, cells, used, to, capture, prey, both, forms, have, a, single, orifice, and, body, cavity, that, are, used, for, digestion, and, respiration, many, cnidarian, species, produce, colonies, that, are, single, organisms, composed, of, medusa, like, or, polyp, like, zooids, or, both, hence, they, are, trimorphic, cnidarians, activities, are, coordinated, by, a, decentralized, nerve, net, and, simple, receptors, cnidarians, also, have, rhopalia, which, are, involved, in, gravity, sensing, and, sometimes, chemoreception, several, free, swimming, species, of, cubozoa, and, scyphozoa, possess, balance, sensing, statocysts, and, some, have, simple, eyes, not, all, cnidarians, reproduce, sexually, but, many, species, have, complex, life, cycles, of, asexual, polyp, stages, and, sexual, medusae, stages, some, however, omit, either, the, polyp, or, the, medusa, stage, and, the, parasitic, classes, evolved, to, have, neither, form, cnidarians, were, formerly, grouped, with, ctenophores, also, known, as, comb, jellies, in, the, phylum, coelenterata, but, increasing, awareness, of, their, differences, caused, them, to, be, placed, in, separate, phyla, cnidarians, are, classified, into, four, main, groups, the, almost, wholly, sessile, anthozoa, sea, anemones, corals, sea, pens, swimming, scyphozoa, jellyfish, cubozoa, box, jellies, and, hydrozoa, a, diverse, group, that, includes, all, the, freshwater, cnidarians, as, well, as, many, marine, forms, and, which, has, both, sessile, members, such, as, hydra, and, colonial, swimmers, such, as, the, portuguese, man, o, war, staurozoa, have, recently, been, recognised, as, a, class, in, their, own, right, rather, than, a, sub, group, of, scyphozoa, and, the, highly, derived, parasitic, myxozoa, and, polypodiozoa, were, firmly, recognized, as, cnidarians, only, in, 2007, most, cnidarians, prey, on, organisms, ranging, in, size, from, plankton, to, animals, several, times, larger, than, themselves, but, many, obtain, much, of, their, nutrition, from, symbiotic, dinoflagellates, and, a, few, are, parasites, many, are, preyed, on, by, other, animals, including, starfish, sea, slugs, fish, turtles, and, even, other, cnidarians, many, scleractinian, corals, which, form, the, structural, foundation, for, coral, reefs, possess, polyps, that, are, filled, with, symbiotic, photo, synthetic, zooxanthellae, while, reef, forming, corals, are, almost, entirely, restricted, to, warm, and, shallow, marine, waters, other, cnidarians, can, be, found, at, great, depths, in, polar, regions, and, in, freshwater, cnidarians, are, a, very, ancient, phylum, with, fossils, having, been, found, in, rocks, formed, about, 580, million, years, ago, during, the, ediacaran, period, preceding, the, cambrian, explosion, other, fossils, show, that, corals, may, have, been, present, shortly, before, 490, million, years, ago, and, diversified, a, few, million, years, later, molecular, clock, analysis, of, mitochondrial, genes, suggests, an, even, older, age, for, the, crown, group, of, cnidarians, estimated, around, 741, million, years, ago, almost, 200, million, years, before, the, cambrian, period, as, well, as, before, any, fossils, recent, phylogenetic, analyses, support, monophyly, of, cnidarians, as, well, as, the, position, of, cnidarians, as, the, sister, group, of, bilaterians, the, term, cnidaria, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, word, kn, d, nettle, signifying, the, coiled, thread, reminiscent, of, cnidocytes, the, word, was, first, coined, in, 1766, by, the, swedish, naturalist, peter, simon, pallas, cnidarians, form, a, phylum, of, animals, that, are, more, complex, than, sponges, about, as, complex, as, ctenophores, comb, jellies, and, less, complex, than, bilaterians, which, include, almost, all, other, animals, both, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, are, more, complex, than, sponges, as, they, have, cells, bound, by, inter, cell, connections, and, carpet, like, basement, membranes, muscles, nervous, systems, and, some, have, sensory, organs, cnidarians, are, distinguished, from, all, other, animals, by, having, cnidocytes, that, fire, harpoon, like, structures, that, are, mainly, used, to, capture, prey, in, some, species, cnidocytes, can, also, be, used, as, anchors, cnidarians, are, also, distinguished, by, the, fact, that, they, have, only, one, opening, in, their, body, for, ingestion, and, excretion, i, e, they, do, not, have, a, separate, mouth, and, anus, like, sponges, and, ctenophores, cnidarians, have, two, main, layers, of, cells, that, sandwich, a, middle, layer, of, jelly, like, material, which, is, called, the, mesoglea, in, cnidarians, more, complex, animals, have, three, main, cell, layers, and, no, intermediate, jelly, like, layer, hence, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, have, traditionally, been, labelled, diploblastic, along, with, sponges, however, both, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, have, a, type, of, muscle, that, in, more, complex, animals, arises, from, the, middle, cell, layer, as, a, result, some, recent, text, books, classify, ctenophores, as, triploblastic, 182, 195, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, cnidarians, evolved, from, triploblastic, ancestors, most, adult, cnidarians, appear, as, either, free, swimming, medusae, or, sessile, polyps, and, many, hydrozoans, species, are, known, to, alternate, between, the, two, forms, both, are, radially, symmetrical, like, a, wheel, and, a, tube, respectively, since, these, animals, have, no, heads, their, ends, are, described, as, oral, nearest, the, mouth, and, aboral, furthest, from, the, mouth, most, have, fringes, of, tentacles, equipped, with, cnidocytes, around, their, edges, and, medusae, generally, have, an, inner, ring, of, tentacles, around, the, mouth, some, hydroids, may, consist, of, colonies, of, zooids, that, serve, different, purposes, such, as, defense, reproduction, and, catching, prey, the, mesoglea, of, polyps, is, usually, thin, and, often, soft, but, that, of, medusae, is, usually, thick, and, springy, so, that, it, returns, to, its, original, shape, after, muscles, around, the, edge, have, contracted, to, squeeze, water, out, enabling, medusae, to, swim, by, a, sort, of, jet, propulsion, in, medusae, the, only, supporting, structure, is, the, mesoglea, hydra, and, most, sea, anemones, close, their, mouths, when, they, are, not, feeding, and, the, water, in, the, digestive, cavity, then, acts, as, a, hydrostatic, skeleton, rather, like, a, water, filled, balloon, other, polyps, such, as, tubularia, use, columns, of, water, filled, cells, for, support, sea, pens, stiffen, the, mesoglea, with, calcium, carbonate, spicules, and, tough, fibrous, proteins, rather, like, sponges, in, some, colonial, polyps, a, chitinous, epidermis, gives, support, and, some, protection, to, the, connecting, sections, and, to, the, lower, parts, of, individual, polyps, a, few, polyps, collect, materials, such, as, sand, grains, and, shell, fragments, which, they, attach, to, their, outsides, some, colonial, sea, anemones, stiffen, the, mesoglea, with, sediment, particles, a, mineralized, exoskeleton, made, of, calcium, carbonate, is, found, in, subphylum, anthozoa, in, the, order, scleractinia, stony, corals, class, hexacorallia, and, the, class, octocorallia, and, in, subphylum, medusozoa, in, three, hydrozoan, families, in, order, anthoathecata, milleporidae, stylasteridae, and, hydractiniidae, the, latter, with, a, mix, of, calcified, and, uncalcified, species, cnidaria, are, diploblastic, animals, in, other, words, they, have, two, main, cell, layers, while, more, complex, animals, are, triploblasts, having, three, main, layers, the, two, main, cell, layers, of, cnidarians, form, epithelia, that, are, mostly, one, cell, thick, and, are, attached, to, a, fibrous, basement, membrane, which, they, secrete, they, also, secrete, the, jelly, like, mesoglea, that, separates, the, layers, the, layer, that, faces, outwards, known, as, the, ectoderm, outside, skin, generally, contains, the, following, types, of, cells, in, addition, to, epitheliomuscular, nerve, and, interstitial, cells, the, inward, facing, gastroderm, stomach, skin, contains, gland, cells, that, secrete, digestive, enzymes, in, some, species, it, also, contains, low, concentrations, of, cnidocytes, which, are, used, to, subdue, prey, that, is, still, struggling, the, mesoglea, contains, small, numbers, of, amoeba, like, cells, and, muscle, cells, in, some, species, however, the, number, of, middle, layer, cells, and, types, are, much, lower, than, in, sponges, polymorphism, refers, to, the, occurrence, of, structurally, and, functionally, more, than, two, different, types, of, individuals, within, the, same, organism, it, is, a, characteristic, feature, of, cnidarians, particularly, the, polyp, and, medusa, forms, or, of, zooids, within, colonial, organisms, like, those, in, hydrozoa, in, hydrozoans, colonial, individuals, arising, from, individual, zooids, will, take, on, separate, tasks, for, example, in, obelia, there, are, feeding, individuals, the, gastrozooids, the, individuals, capable, of, asexual, reproduction, only, the, gonozooids, blastostyles, and, free, living, or, sexually, reproducing, individuals, the, medusae, these, nettle, cells, function, as, harpoons, since, their, payloads, remain, connected, to, the, bodies, of, the, cells, by, threads, three, types, of, cnidocytes, are, known, the, main, components, of, a, cnidocyte, are, it, is, difficult, to, study, the, firing, mechanisms, of, cnidocytes, as, these, structures, are, small, but, very, complex, at, least, four, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, cnidocytes, can, only, fire, once, and, about, 25, of, a, hydra, s, nematocysts, are, lost, from, its, tentacles, when, capturing, a, brine, shrimp, used, cnidocytes, have, to, be, replaced, which, takes, about, 48, hours, to, minimise, wasteful, firing, two, types, of, stimulus, are, generally, required, to, trigger, cnidocytes, nearby, sensory, cells, detect, chemicals, in, the, water, and, their, cilia, respond, to, contact, this, combination, prevents, them, from, firing, at, distant, or, non, living, objects, groups, of, cnidocytes, are, usually, connected, by, nerves, and, if, one, fires, the, rest, of, the, group, requires, a, weaker, minimum, stimulus, than, the, cells, that, fire, first, medusae, swim, by, a, form, of, jet, propulsion, muscles, especially, inside, the, rim, of, the, bell, squeeze, water, out, of, the, cavity, inside, the, bell, and, the, springiness, of, the, mesoglea, powers, the, recovery, stroke, since, the, tissue, layers, are, very, thin, they, provide, too, little, power, to, swim, against, currents, and, just, enough, to, control, movement, within, currents, hydras, and, some, sea, anemones, can, move, slowly, over, rocks, and, sea, or, stream, beds, by, various, means, creeping, like, snails, crawling, like, inchworms, or, by, somersaulting, a, few, can, swim, clumsily, by, waggling, their, bases, cnidarians, are, generally, thought, to, have, no, brains, or, even, central, nervous, systems, however, they, do, have, integrative, areas, of, neural, tissue, that, could, be, considered, some, form, of, centralization, most, of, their, bodies, are, innervated, by, decentralized, nerve, nets, that, control, their, swimming, musculature, and, connect, with, sensory, structures, though, each, clade, has, slightly, different, structures, these, sensory, structures, usually, called, rhopalia, can, generate, signals, in, response, to, various, types, of, stimuli, such, as, light, pressure, chemical, changes, and, much, more, medusa, usually, have, several, of, them, around, the, margin, of, the, bell, that, work, together, to, control, the, motor, nerve, net, that, directly, innervates, the, swimming, muscles, most, cnidarians, also, have, a, parallel, system, in, scyphozoans, this, takes, the, form, of, a, diffuse, nerve, net, which, has, modulatory, effects, on, the, nervous, system, as, well, as, forming, the, signal, cables, between, sensory, neurons, and, motoneurons, intermediate, neurons, in, the, nerve, net, can, also, form, ganglia, that, act, as, local, coordination, centers, communication, between, nerve, cells, can, occur, by, chemical, synapses, or, gap, junctions, in, hydrozoans, though, gap, junctions, are, not, present, in, all, groups, cnidarians, have, many, of, the, same, neurotransmitters, as, bilaterians, including, chemicals, such, as, glutamate, gaba, and, glycine, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, octopamine, histamine, and, acetylcholine, on, the, other, hand, are, absent, this, structure, ensures, that, the, musculature, is, excited, rapidly, and, simultaneously, and, can, be, directly, stimulated, from, any, point, on, the, body, and, it, also, is, better, able, to, recover, after, injury, medusae, and, complex, swimming, colonies, such, as, siphonophores, and, chondrophores, sense, tilt, and, acceleration, by, means, of, statocysts, chambers, lined, with, hairs, which, detect, the, movements, of, internal, mineral, grains, called, statoliths, if, the, body, tilts, in, the, wrong, direction, the, animal, rights, itself, by, increasing, the, strength, of, the, swimming, movements, on, the, side, that, is, too, low, most, species, have, ocelli, simple, eyes, which, can, detect, sources, of, light, however, the, agile, box, jellyfish, are, unique, among, medusae, because, they, possess, four, kinds, of, true, eyes, that, have, retinas, corneas, and, lenses, although, the, eyes, probably, do, not, form, images, cubozoa, can, clearly, distinguish, the, direction, from, which, light, is, coming, as, well, as, negotiate, around, solid, colored, objects, cnidarians, feed, in, several, ways, predation, absorbing, dissolved, organic, chemicals, filtering, food, particles, out, of, the, water, obtaining, nutrients, from, symbiotic, algae, within, their, cells, and, parasitism, most, obtain, the, majority, of, their, food, from, predation, but, some, including, the, corals, hetroxenia, and, leptogorgia, depend, almost, completely, on, their, endosymbionts, and, on, absorbing, dissolved, nutrients, cnidaria, give, their, symbiotic, algae, carbon, dioxide, some, nutrients, and, protection, against, predators, predatory, species, use, their, cnidocytes, to, poison, or, entangle, prey, and, those, with, venomous, nematocysts, may, start, digestion, by, injecting, digestive, enzymes, the, smell, of, fluids, from, wounded, prey, makes, the, tentacles, fold, inwards, and, wipe, the, prey, off, into, the, mouth, in, medusae, the, tentacles, round, the, edge, of, the, bell, are, often, short, and, most, of, the, prey, capture, is, done, by, oral, arms, which, are, extensions, of, the, edge, of, the, mouth, and, are, often, frilled, and, sometimes, branched, to, increase, their, surface, area, these, oral, arms, aid, in, cnidarians, ability, to, move, prey, towards, their, mouth, once, it, has, been, poisoned, and, entangled, medusae, often, trap, prey, or, suspended, food, particles, by, swimming, upwards, spreading, their, tentacles, and, oral, arms, and, then, sinking, in, species, for, which, suspended, food, particles, are, important, the, tentacles, and, oral, arms, often, have, rows, of, cilia, whose, beating, creates, currents, that, flow, towards, the, mouth, and, some, produce, nets, of, mucus, to, trap, particles, their, digestion, is, both, intra, and, extracellular, once, the, food, is, in, the, digestive, cavity, gland, cells, in, the, gastroderm, release, enzymes, that, reduce, the, prey, to, slurry, usually, within, a, few, hours, this, circulates, through, the, digestive, cavity, and, in, colonial, cnidarians, through, the, connecting, tunnels, so, that, gastroderm, cells, can, absorb, the, nutrients, absorption, may, take, a, few, hours, and, digestion, within, the, cells, may, take, a, few, days, the, circulation, of, nutrients, is, driven, by, water, currents, produced, by, cilia, in, the, gastroderm, or, by, muscular, movements, or, both, so, that, nutrients, reach, all, parts, of, the, digestive, cavity, nutrients, reach, the, outer, cell, layer, by, diffusion, or, for, animals, or, zooids, such, as, medusae, which, have, thick, mesogleas, are, transported, by, mobile, cells, in, the, mesoglea, indigestible, remains, of, prey, are, expelled, through, the, mouth, the, main, waste, product, of, cells, internal, processes, is, ammonia, which, is, removed, by, the, external, and, internal, water, currents, there, are, no, respiratory, organs, and, both, cell, layers, absorb, oxygen, from, and, expel, carbon, dioxide, into, the, surrounding, water, when, the, water, in, the, digestive, cavity, becomes, stale, it, must, be, replaced, and, nutrients, that, have, not, been, absorbed, will, be, expelled, with, it, some, anthozoa, have, ciliated, grooves, on, their, tentacles, allowing, them, to, pump, water, out, of, and, into, the, digestive, cavity, without, opening, the, mouth, this, improves, respiration, after, feeding, and, allows, these, animals, which, use, the, cavity, as, a, hydrostatic, skeleton, to, control, the, water, pressure, in, the, cavity, without, expelling, undigested, food, cnidaria, that, carry, photosynthetic, symbionts, may, have, the, opposite, problem, an, excess, of, oxygen, which, may, prove, toxic, the, animals, produce, large, quantities, of, antioxidants, to, neutralize, the, excess, oxygen, all, cnidarians, can, regenerate, allowing, them, to, recover, from, injury, and, to, reproduce, asexually, medusae, have, limited, ability, to, regenerate, but, polyps, can, do, so, from, small, pieces, or, even, collections, of, separated, cells, this, enables, corals, to, recover, even, after, apparently, being, destroyed, by, predators, cnidarian, sexual, reproduction, often, involves, a, complex, life, cycle, with, both, polyp, and, medusa, stages, for, example, in, scyphozoa, jellyfish, and, cubozoa, box, jellies, a, larva, swims, until, it, finds, a, good, site, and, then, becomes, a, polyp, this, grows, normally, but, then, absorbs, its, tentacles, and, splits, horizontally, into, a, series, of, disks, that, become, juvenile, medusae, a, process, called, strobilation, the, juveniles, swim, off, and, slowly, grow, to, maturity, while, the, polyp, re, grows, and, may, continue, strobilating, periodically, the, adult, medusae, have, gonads, in, the, gastroderm, and, these, release, ova, and, sperm, into, the, water, in, the, breeding, season, this, phenomenon, of, succession, of, differently, organized, generations, one, asexually, reproducing, sessile, polyp, followed, by, a, free, swimming, medusa, or, a, sessile, polyp, that, reproduces, sexually, is, sometimes, called, alternation, of, asexual, and, sexual, phases, or, metagenesis, but, should, not, be, confused, with, the, alternation, of, generations, as, found, in, plants, shortened, forms, of, this, life, cycle, are, common, for, example, some, oceanic, scyphozoans, omit, the, polyp, stage, completely, and, cubozoan, polyps, produce, only, one, medusa, hydrozoa, have, a, variety, of, life, cycles, some, have, no, polyp, stages, and, some, e, g, hydra, have, no, medusae, in, some, species, the, medusae, remain, attached, to, the, polyp, and, are, responsible, for, sexual, reproduction, in, extreme, cases, these, reproductive, zooids, may, not, look, much, like, medusae, meanwhile, life, cycle, reversal, in, which, polyps, are, formed, directly, from, medusae, without, the, involvement, of, sexual, reproduction, process, was, observed, in, both, hydrozoa, turritopsis, dohrnii, and, laodicea, undulata, and, scyphozoa, aurelia, sp, 1, anthozoa, have, no, medusa, stage, at, all, and, the, polyps, are, responsible, for, sexual, reproduction, spawning, is, generally, driven, by, environmental, factors, such, as, changes, in, the, water, temperature, and, their, release, is, triggered, by, lighting, conditions, such, as, sunrise, sunset, or, the, phase, of, the, moon, many, species, of, cnidaria, may, spawn, simultaneously, in, the, same, location, so, that, there, are, too, many, ova, and, sperm, for, predators, to, eat, more, than, a, tiny, percentage, one, famous, example, is, the, great, barrier, reef, where, at, least, 110, corals, and, a, few, non, cnidarian, invertebrates, produce, enough, gametes, to, turn, the, water, cloudy, these, mass, spawnings, may, produce, hybrids, some, of, which, can, settle, and, form, polyps, but, it, is, not, known, how, long, these, can, survive, in, some, species, the, ova, release, chemicals, that, attract, sperm, of, the, same, species, the, fertilized, eggs, develop, into, larvae, by, dividing, until, there, are, enough, cells, to, form, a, hollow, sphere, blastula, and, then, a, depression, forms, at, one, end, gastrulation, and, eventually, becomes, the, digestive, cavity, however, in, cnidarians, the, depression, forms, at, the, end, further, from, the, yolk, at, the, animal, pole, while, in, bilaterians, it, forms, at, the, other, end, vegetal, pole, the, larvae, called, planulae, swim, or, crawl, by, means, of, cilia, they, are, cigar, shaped, but, slightly, broader, at, the, front, end, which, is, the, aboral, vegetal, pole, end, and, eventually, attaches, to, a, substrate, if, the, species, has, a, polyp, stage, anthozoan, larvae, either, have, large, yolks, or, are, capable, of, feeding, on, plankton, and, some, already, have, endosymbiotic, algae, that, help, to, feed, them, since, the, parents, are, immobile, these, feeding, capabilities, extend, the, larvae, s, range, and, avoid, overcrowding, of, sites, scyphozoan, and, hydrozoan, larvae, have, little, yolk, and, most, lack, endosymbiotic, algae, and, therefore, have, to, settle, quickly, and, metamorphose, into, polyps, instead, these, species, rely, on, their, medusae, to, extend, their, ranges, all, known, cnidaria, can, reproduce, asexually, by, various, means, in, addition, to, regenerating, after, being, fragmented, hydrozoan, polyps, only, bud, while, the, medusae, of, some, hydrozoans, can, divide, down, the, middle, scyphozoan, polyps, can, both, bud, and, split, down, the, middle, in, addition, to, both, of, these, methods, anthozoa, can, split, horizontally, just, above, the, base, asexual, reproduction, makes, the, daughter, cnidarian, a, clone, of, the, adult, the, ability, of, cnidarians, to, asexually, reproduce, ensures, a, greater, number, of, mature, medusa, that, can, mature, to, reproduce, sexually, two, classical, dna, repair, pathways, nucleotide, excision, repair, and, base, excision, repair, are, present, in, hydra, and, these, repair, pathways, facilitate, unhindered, reproduction, the, identification, of, these, pathways, in, hydra, is, based, in, part, on, the, presence, in, the, hydra, genome, of, genes, homologous, to, genes, in, other, genetically, well, studied, species, that, have, been, demonstrated, to, play, key, roles, in, these, dna, repair, pathways, cnidarians, were, for, a, long, time, grouped, with, ctenophores, in, the, phylum, coelenterata, but, increasing, awareness, of, their, differences, caused, them, to, be, placed, in, separate, phyla, modern, cnidarians, are, generally, classified, into, four, main, classes, sessile, anthozoa, sea, anemones, corals, sea, pens, swimming, scyphozoa, jellyfish, and, cubozoa, box, jellies, and, hydrozoa, a, diverse, group, that, includes, all, the, freshwater, cnidarians, as, well, as, many, marine, forms, and, has, both, sessile, members, such, as, hydra, and, colonial, swimmers, such, as, the, portuguese, man, o, war, staurozoa, have, recently, been, recognised, as, a, class, in, their, own, right, rather, than, a, sub, group, of, scyphozoa, and, the, parasitic, myxozoa, and, polypodiozoa, are, now, recognized, as, highly, derived, cnidarians, rather, than, more, closely, related, to, the, bilaterians, stauromedusae, small, sessile, cnidarians, with, stalks, and, no, medusa, stage, have, traditionally, been, classified, as, members, of, the, scyphozoa, but, recent, research, suggests, they, should, be, regarded, as, a, separate, class, staurozoa, the, myxozoa, microscopic, parasites, were, first, classified, as, protozoans, research, then, found, that, polypodium, hydriforme, a, non, myxozoan, parasite, within, the, egg, cells, of, sturgeon, is, closely, related, to, the, myxozoa, and, suggested, that, both, polypodium, and, the, myxozoa, were, intermediate, between, cnidarians, and, bilaterian, animals, more, recent, research, demonstrates, that, the, previous, identification, of, bilaterian, genes, reflected, contamination, of, the, myxozoan, samples, by, material, from, their, host, organism, and, they, are, now, firmly, identified, as, heavily, derived, cnidarians, and, more, closely, related, to, hydrozoa, and, scyphozoa, than, to, anthozoa, some, researchers, classify, the, extinct, conulariids, as, cnidarians, while, others, propose, that, they, form, a, completely, separate, phylum, current, classification, according, to, the, world, register, of, marine, species, many, cnidarians, are, limited, to, shallow, waters, because, they, depend, on, endosymbiotic, algae, for, much, of, their, nutrients, the, life, cycles, of, most, have, polyp, stages, which, are, limited, to, locations, that, offer, stable, substrates, nevertheless, major, cnidarian, groups, contain, species, that, have, escaped, these, limitations, hydrozoans, have, a, worldwide, range, some, such, as, hydra, live, in, freshwater, obelia, appears, in, the, coastal, waters, of, all, the, oceans, and, liriope, can, form, large, shoals, near, the, surface, in, mid, ocean, among, anthozoans, a, few, scleractinian, corals, sea, pens, and, sea, fans, live, in, deep, cold, waters, and, some, sea, anemones, inhabit, polar, seabeds, while, others, live, near, hydrothermal, vents, over, 10, km, 33, 000, ft, below, sea, level, reef, building, corals, are, limited, to, tropical, seas, between, 30, n, and, 30, s, with, a, maximum, depth, of, 46, m, 151, ft, temperatures, between, 20, and, 28, c, 68, and, 82, f, high, salinity, and, low, carbon, dioxide, levels, stauromedusae, although, usually, classified, as, jellyfish, are, stalked, sessile, animals, that, live, in, cool, to, arctic, waters, cnidarians, range, in, size, from, a, mere, handful, of, cells, for, the, parasitic, myxozoans, through, hydra, s, length, of, 5, 20, mm, 1, 4, 3, 4, in, to, the, lion, s, mane, jellyfish, which, may, exceed, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, diameter, and, 75, m, 246, ft, in, length, prey, of, cnidarians, ranges, from, plankton, to, animals, several, times, larger, than, themselves, some, cnidarians, are, parasites, mainly, on, jellyfish, but, a, few, are, major, pests, of, fish, others, obtain, most, of, their, nourishment, from, endosymbiotic, algae, or, dissolved, nutrients, predators, of, cnidarians, include, sea, slugs, flatworms, and, comb, jellies, which, can, incorporate, nematocysts, into, their, own, bodies, for, self, defense, nematocysts, used, by, cnidarian, predators, are, referred, to, as, kleptocnidae, starfish, notably, the, crown, of, thorns, starfish, which, can, devastate, corals, butterfly, fish, and, parrot, fish, which, eat, corals, and, marine, turtles, which, eat, jellyfish, some, sea, anemones, and, jellyfish, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, some, fish, for, example, clownfish, live, among, the, tentacles, of, sea, anemones, and, each, partner, protects, the, other, against, predators, coral, reefs, form, some, of, the, world, s, most, productive, ecosystems, common, coral, reef, cnidarians, include, both, anthozoans, hard, corals, octocorals, anemones, and, hydrozoans, fire, corals, lace, corals, the, endosymbiotic, algae, of, many, cnidarian, species, are, very, effective, primary, producers, in, other, words, converters, of, inorganic, chemicals, into, organic, ones, that, other, organisms, can, use, and, their, coral, hosts, use, these, organic, chemicals, very, efficiently, in, addition, reefs, provide, complex, and, varied, habitats, that, support, a, wide, range, of, other, organisms, fringing, reefs, just, below, low, tide, level, also, have, a, mutually, beneficial, relationship, with, mangrove, forests, at, high, tide, level, and, seagrass, meadows, in, between, the, reefs, protect, the, mangroves, and, seagrass, from, strong, currents, and, waves, that, would, damage, them, or, erode, the, sediments, in, which, they, are, rooted, while, the, mangroves, and, seagrass, protect, the, coral, from, large, influxes, of, silt, fresh, water, and, pollutants, this, additional, level, of, variety, in, the, environment, is, beneficial, to, many, types, of, coral, reef, animals, which, for, example, may, feed, in, the, sea, grass, and, use, the, reefs, for, protection, or, breeding, the, earliest, widely, accepted, animal, fossils, are, rather, modern, looking, cnidarians, possibly, from, around, 580, million, years, ago, although, fossils, from, the, doushantuo, formation, can, only, be, dated, approximately, the, identification, of, some, of, these, as, embryos, of, animals, has, been, contested, but, other, fossils, from, these, rocks, strongly, resemble, tubes, and, other, mineralized, structures, made, by, corals, their, presence, implies, that, the, cnidarian, and, bilaterian, lineages, had, already, diverged, although, the, ediacaran, fossil, charnia, used, to, be, classified, as, a, jellyfish, or, sea, pen, more, recent, study, of, growth, patterns, in, charnia, and, modern, cnidarians, has, cast, doubt, on, this, hypothesis, leaving, the, canadian, polyp, haootia, and, the, british, auroralumina, as, the, only, recognized, cnidarian, body, fossils, from, the, ediacaran, auroralumina, is, the, earliest, known, animal, predator, few, fossils, of, cnidarians, without, mineralized, skeletons, are, known, from, more, recent, rocks, except, in, lagerst, tten, that, preserved, soft, bodied, animals, a, few, mineralized, fossils, that, resemble, corals, have, been, found, in, rocks, from, the, cambrian, period, and, corals, diversified, in, the, early, ordovician, these, corals, which, were, wiped, out, in, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, about, 252, million, years, ago, did, not, dominate, reef, construction, since, sponges, and, algae, also, played, a, major, part, during, the, mesozoic, era, rudist, bivalves, were, the, main, reef, builders, but, they, were, wiped, out, in, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, 66, million, years, ago, and, since, then, the, main, reef, builders, have, been, scleractinian, corals, it, is, difficult, to, reconstruct, the, early, stages, in, the, evolutionary, family, tree, of, animals, using, only, morphology, their, shapes, and, structures, because, the, large, differences, between, porifera, sponges, cnidaria, plus, ctenophora, comb, jellies, placozoa, and, bilateria, all, the, more, complex, animals, make, comparisons, difficult, hence, reconstructions, now, rely, largely, or, entirely, on, molecular, phylogenetics, which, groups, organisms, according, to, similarities, and, differences, in, their, biochemistry, usually, in, their, dna, or, rna, it, is, now, generally, thought, that, the, calcarea, sponges, with, calcium, carbonate, spicules, are, more, closely, related, to, cnidaria, ctenophora, comb, jellies, and, bilateria, all, the, more, complex, animals, than, they, are, to, the, other, groups, of, sponges, in, 1866, it, was, proposed, that, cnidaria, and, ctenophora, were, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, bilateria, and, formed, a, group, called, coelenterata, hollow, guts, because, cnidaria, and, ctenophora, both, rely, on, the, flow, of, water, in, and, out, of, a, single, cavity, for, feeding, excretion, and, respiration, in, 1881, it, was, proposed, that, ctenophora, and, bilateria, were, more, closely, related, to, each, other, since, they, shared, features, that, cnidaria, lack, for, example, muscles, in, the, middle, layer, mesoglea, in, ctenophora, mesoderm, in, bilateria, however, more, recent, analyses, indicate, that, these, similarities, are, rather, vague, and, the, current, view, based, on, molecular, phylogenetics, is, that, cnidaria, and, bilateria, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, ctenophora, this, grouping, of, cnidaria, and, bilateria, has, been, labelled, planulozoa, because, it, suggests, that, the, earliest, bilateria, were, similar, to, the, planula, larvae, of, cnidaria, within, the, cnidaria, the, anthozoa, sea, anemones, and, corals, are, regarded, as, the, sister, group, of, the, rest, which, suggests, that, the, earliest, cnidarians, were, sessile, polyps, with, no, medusa, stage, however, it, is, unclear, how, the, other, groups, acquired, the, medusa, stage, since, hydrozoa, form, medusae, by, budding, from, the, side, of, the, polyp, while, the, other, medusozoa, do, so, by, splitting, them, off, from, the, tip, of, the, polyp, the, traditional, grouping, of, scyphozoa, included, the, staurozoa, but, morphology, and, molecular, phylogenetics, indicate, that, staurozoa, are, more, closely, related, to, cubozoa, box, jellies, than, to, other, scyphozoa, similarities, in, the, double, body, walls, of, staurozoa, and, the, extinct, conulariida, suggest, that, they, are, closely, related, however, in, 2005, katja, seipel, and, volker, schmid, suggested, that, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, are, simplified, descendants, of, triploblastic, animals, since, ctenophores, and, the, medusa, stage, of, some, cnidarians, have, striated, muscle, which, in, bilaterians, arises, from, the, mesoderm, they, did, not, commit, themselves, on, whether, bilaterians, evolved, from, early, cnidarians, or, from, the, hypothesized, triploblastic, ancestors, of, cnidarians, in, molecular, phylogenetics, analyses, from, 2005, onwards, important, groups, of, developmental, genes, show, the, same, variety, in, cnidarians, as, in, chordates, in, fact, cnidarians, and, especially, anthozoans, sea, anemones, and, corals, retain, some, genes, that, are, present, in, bacteria, protists, plants, and, fungi, but, not, in, bilaterians, the, mitochondrial, genome, in, the, medusozoan, cnidarians, unlike, those, in, other, animals, is, linear, with, fragmented, genes, the, reason, for, this, difference, is, unknown, jellyfish, stings, killed, about, 1, 500, people, in, the, 20th, century, and, cubozoans, are, particularly, dangerous, on, the, other, hand, some, large, jellyfish, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, east, and, southeast, asia, coral, reefs, have, long, been, economically, important, as, providers, of, fishing, grounds, protectors, of, shore, buildings, against, currents, and, tides, and, more, recently, as, centers, of, tourism, however, they, are, vulnerable, to, over, fishing, mining, for, construction, materials, pollution, and, damage, caused, by, tourism, beaches, protected, from, tides, and, storms, by, coral, reefs, are, often, the, best, places, for, housing, in, tropical, countries, reefs, are, an, important, food, source, for, low, technology, fishing, both, on, the, reefs, themselves, and, in, the, adjacent, seas, however, despite, their, great, productivity, reefs, are, vulnerable, to, over, fishing, because, much, of, the, organic, carbon, they, produce, is, exhaled, as, carbon, dioxide, by, organisms, at, the, middle, levels, of, the, food, chain, and, never, reaches, the, larger, species, that, are, of, interest, to, fishermen, tourism, centered, on, reefs, provides, much, of, the, income, of, some, tropical, islands, attracting, photographers, divers, and, sports, fishermen, however, human, activities, damage, reefs, in, several, ways, mining, for, construction, materials, pollution, including, large, influxes, of, fresh, water, from, storm, drains, commercial, fishing, including, the, use, of, dynamite, to, stun, fish, and, the, capture, of, young, fish, for, aquariums, and, tourist, damage, caused, by, boat, anchors, and, the, cumulative, effect, of, walking, on, the, reefs, coral, mainly, from, the, pacific, ocean, has, long, been, used, in, jewellery, and, demand, rose, sharply, in, the, 1980s, some, large, jellyfish, species, of, the, rhizostomeae, order, are, commonly, consumed, in, japan, korea, and, southeast, asia, in, parts, of, the, range, fishing, industry, is, restricted, to, daylight, hours, and, calm, conditions, in, two, short, seasons, from, march, to, may, and, august, to, november, the, commercial, value, of, jellyfish, food, products, depends, on, the, skill, with, which, they, are, prepared, and, jellyfish, masters, guard, their, trade, secrets, carefully, jellyfish, is, very, low, in, cholesterol, and, sugars, but, cheap, preparation, can, introduce, undesirable, amounts, of, heavy, metals, the, sea, wasp, chironex, fleckeri, has, been, described, as, the, world, s, most, venomous, jellyfish, and, is, held, responsible, for, 67, deaths, although, it, is, difficult, to, identify, the, animal, as, it, is, almost, transparent, most, stingings, by, c, fleckeri, cause, only, mild, symptoms, seven, other, box, jellies, can, cause, a, set, of, symptoms, called, irukandji, syndrome, which, takes, about, 30, minutes, to, develop, and, from, a, few, hours, to, two, weeks, to, disappear, hospital, treatment, is, usually, required, and, there, have, been, a, few, deaths, a, number, of, the, parasitic, myxozoans, are, commercially, important, pathogens, in, salmonid, aquaculture, a, scyphozoa, species, pelagia, noctiluca, and, a,
