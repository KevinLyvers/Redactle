an, atlantic, species, which, range, from, southern, labrador, to, rhode, island, they, are, also, found, in, europe, where, they, are, called, rough, dab, or, long, rough, dab, they, spawn, in, the,

organization, to, be, overfished, with, no, signs, of, recovery, though, they, are, also, currently, endangered, in, canada, due, to, overfishing, the, canadian, government, believes, the, species, is, abundant, flatfish, as, a, group, are, second, most, caught, by, weight, only, to, cod, in, canada, with, american, plaice, accounting, for, 50, percent, of, all, flatfish, caught, american, plaice, may, be, an, intermediate, host, for, the, nematode, parasite, otostrongylus, circumlitis, which, is, a, lungworm, of, seals, primarily, affecting, animals, less, than, 1, year, of, age, alaska, plaice, can, live, for, up, to, 30, years, and, grow, to, 60, cm, 24, in, long, but, most, that, are, caught, are, only, seven, or, eight, years, old, and, about, 30, cm, 12, in, most, commercial, fisheries, do, not, target, alaska, plaice, but, many, are, caught, as, bycatch, by, commercial, trawlers, trying, to, catch, other, bottom, fish, thus, many, alaska, plaice, get, caught, anyway, so, much, so, that, for, example, the, 2005, total, allowable, catch, in, the, bering, sea, and, aleutian, islands, management, area, bsai, was, reached, before, the, end, of, may, of, that, year, the, scale, eye, plaice, is, a, flatfish, of, the, family, pleuronectidae, it, is, a, demersal, fish, that, lives, at, depths, of, 18, to, 900, m, 59, to, 3, 000, ft, it, can, reach, 46, cm, 18, in, in, length, and, can, weigh, up, to, 1, 2, kg, 2, 6, lb, its, native, habitat, is, the, northern, pacific, primarily, from, the, sea, of, okhotsk, to, japan, and, korea, though, it, is, also,

limits, moreover, they, are, growing, less, quickly, now, and, are, rarely, older, than, six, years, whereas, they, can, reach, forty, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, says, that, in, 2006, of, the, eight, plaice, stocks, recognised, by, ices, only, one, is, considered, to, be, harvested, sustainably, while, three, are, overexploited, data, is, insufficient, to, assess, the, remaining,
