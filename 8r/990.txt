oak, trees, of, cultural, significance, include, the, royal, oak, in, britain, the, charter, oak, in, the, united, states, and, the, guernica, oak, in, the, basque, country, the, generic, name, quercus, is, latin, for, oak, derived, from, proto, indo, european, kwerkwu, oak, which, is, also, the, origin, of, the, name, fir, another, important, or, sacred, tree, in, indo, european, culture, the, word, cork, for, the, bark, of, the, cork, oak, similarly, derives, from, quercus, the, common, name, oak, is, from, old, english, ac, seen, in, placenames, such, as, acton, from, ac, tun, oak,

and, north, africa, north, of, the, sahara, from, morocco, to, libya, in, mediterranean, europe, they, are, joined, by, oaks, of, the, sections, cerris, and, ilex, which, extend, across, turkey, the, middle, east, iran, afghanistan, and, pakistan, while, section, ponticae, is, endemic, to, the, western, caucasus, in, turkey, and, georgia, oaks, of, section, cyclobalanopsis, extend, in, a, narrow, belt, along, the, himalayas, to, cover, mainland, and, island, southeast, asia, as, far, as, sumatra, java, borneo, and, palawan, finally, oaks, of, multiple, sections, cyclobalanopsis, ilex, cerris, quercus, and, related, genera, like, lithocarpus, and, castanopsis, extend, across, east, asia, including, china, korea, and, japan, potential, records, of, quercus, have, been, reported, from, late, cretaceous, deposits, in, north, america, and, east, asia, these, are, not, considered, definitive, as, macrofossils, older, than, the, paleogene, and, possibly, from, before, the, eocene, are, mostly, poorly, preserved, without, critical, features, for, certain, identification, amongst, the, oldest, unequivocal, records, of, quercus, are, pollen, from, austria, dating, to, the, paleocene,

sequenced, revealing, an, array, of, mutations, that, may, underlie, the, evolution, of, longevity, and, disease, resistance, in, oaks, in, addition, hundreds, of, oak, species, have, been, compared, at, rad, seq, loci, allowing, a, detailed, phylogeny, to, be, constructed, however, the, high, signal, of, introgressive, hybridization, the, transfer, of, genetic, material, by, repeated,

giving, names, but, no, types, for, q, cerris, q, coccifera, q, ilex, q, smilax, and, q, suber, he, chose, q, robur, the, pedunculate, oak, as, the, type, species, for, the, genus, a, 2017, classification, of, quercus, based, on, multiple, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, divided, the, genus, into, two, subgenera, and, eight, sections, the, subgenus, division, supports, the,

quercus, oaks, that, diversified, mainly, in, the, americas, the, type, species, is, quercus, cerris, oaks, are, keystone, species, in, a, wide, range, of, habitats, from, mediterranean, semi, desert, to, subtropical, rainforest, they, are, important, components, of, hardwood, forests, some, species, grow, in, associations, with, members, of, the, ericaceae, in, oak, heath, forests, several, kinds, of, truffles, including, two, well, known, varieties, black, p, rigord, truffle, and, the, white, piedmont, truffle, have, symbiotic, relationships, with, oak, trees, similarly, many, other, fungi, such, as, ramaria, flavosaponaria, associate, with, oaks, oaks, support, more, than, 950, species, of, caterpillars, an, important, food, source, for, many, birds, mature, oak, trees, shed, widely, varying, numbers, of, acorns, known, collectively, as, mast, annually, with, large, quantities, in, mast, years, this, may, be, a, predator, satiation, strategy, increasing, the, chance, that, some, acorns, will, survive, to, germination, animals, including, squirrels, and, jays, eurasian, jays, in, the, old, world, blue, jays, in, north, america, feed, on, acorns, and, are, important, agents, of, seed, dispersal, as, they, carry, the, acorns, away, and, bury, many, of, them, as, food, stores, however, some, species, of, squirrel, selectively, excise, the, embryos, from, the, acorns, that, they, store, meaning, that, the, food, store, lasts, longer, and, that, the, acorns, will, never, germinate, interspecific, hybridization, is, quite, common, among, oaks, but, usually, between, species, within, the, same, section, only, and, most, common, in, the, white, oak, group, white, oaks, cannot, discriminate, against, pollination, by, other, species, in, the, same, section, because, they, are, wind, pollinated, and, have, weak, internal, barriers, to, hybridization, hybridization, produces, functional, seeds, and, fertile, hybrid, offspring, ecological, stresses, especially, near, habitat, margins, can, also, cause, a, breakdown, of, mate, recognition, as, well, as, a, reduction, of, male, function, pollen, quantity, and, quality, in, one, parent, species, frequent, hybridization, among, oaks, has, consequences, for, oak, populations, around, the, world, most, notably, hybridization, has, produced, large, populations, of, hybrids, with, much, introgression, and, the, evolution, of, new, species, introgression, has, caused, different, species, in, the, same, populations, to, share, up, to, 50, of, their, genetic, information, as, a, result, genetic, data, often, does, not, differentiate, between, clearly, morphologically, distinct, species, but, instead, differentiates, populations, the, maintenance, of, particular, loci, for, adaptation, to, ecological, niches, may, explain, the, retention, of, species, identity, despite, significant, gene, flow, the, fagaceae, or, beech, family, to, which, the, oaks, belong, is, a, slowly, evolving, clade, compared, to, other, angiosperms, and, the, patterns, of, hybridization, and, introgression, in, quercus, pose, a, significant, challenge, to, the, concept, of, a, species, as, a, group, of, actually, or, potentially, interbreeding, populations, which, are, reproductively, isolated, from, other, such, groups, by, this, definition, many, species, of, quercus, would, be, lumped, together, according, to, their, geographic, and, ecological, habitat, despite, clear, distinctions, in, morphology, and, genetic, data, oaks, are, affected, by, a, large, number, of, pests, and, diseases, for,

galls, are, found, on, oak, leaves, buds, flowers, and, roots, examples, are, oak, artichoke, gall, oak, marble, gall, oak, apple, gall, knopper, gall, and, spangle, gall, these, galls, are, the, handiwork, of, tiny, wasps, from, the, cynipidae, in, a, complex, ecological, relationship, these, gall, wasps, become, hosts, to, parasitoid, wasps, primarily, from, the, order, chalcidoidea, which,

years, large, areas, of, oak, forest, in, the, highlands, of, mexico, central, america, and, the, northern, andes, have, been, cleared, for, coffee, plantations, and, cattle, ranching, there, is, a, continuing, threat, to, these, forests, from, exploitation, for, timber, fuelwood, and, charcoal, in, the, us, entire, oak, ecosystems, have, declined, due, to, a, combination, of, factors, thought, to, include, fire, suppression, increased, consumption, of, acorns, by, growing, mammal, populations, herbivory, of, seedlings, and, introduced, pests, however, disturbance, tolerant, oaks, may, have,
