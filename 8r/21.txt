related, meanings, firstly, it, is, the, dynamic, evolutionary, process, of, natural, selection, that, fits, organisms, to, their, environment, enhancing, their, evolutionary, fitness, secondly, it, is, a, state, reached, by, the, population, during, that, process, thirdly, it, is, a, phenotypic, trait, or, adaptive, trait, with, a, functional, role, in, each, individual, organism, that, is, maintained, and, has, evolved, through, natural, selection, historically, adaptation, has, been, described, from, the, time, of, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, such, as, empedocles, and, aristotle, in, 18th, and, 19th, century, natural, theology, adaptation, was, taken, as, evidence, for, the, existence, of, a, deity, charles, darwin, proposed, instead, that, it, was, explained, by, natural, selection, adaptation, is, related, to, biological, fitness, which, governs, the, rate, of, evolution, as, measured, by, change, in, allele, frequencies, often, two, or, more, species, co, adapt, and, co, evolve, as, they, develop, adaptations, that, interlock, with, those, of, the, other, species, such, as, with, flowering, plants, and, pollinating, insects, in, mimicry, species, evolve, to, resemble, other, species, in, mimicry, this, is, a, mutually, beneficial, co, evolution, as, each, of, a, group, of, strongly, defended, species, such, as, wasps, able, to, sting, come, to, advertise, their, defenses, in, the, same, way, features, evolved, for, one, purpose, may, be, co, opted, for, a, different, one, as, when, the, insulating, feathers, of, dinosaurs, were, co, opted, for, bird, flight, adaptation, is, a, major, topic, in, the, philosophy, of, biology, as, it, concerns, function, and, purpose, teleology, some, biologists, try, to, avoid, terms, which, imply, purpose, in, adaptation, not, least, because, it, suggests, a, deity, s, intentions, but, others, note, that, adaptation, is, necessarily, purposeful, adaptation, is, an, observable, fact, of, life, accepted, by, philosophers, and, natural, historians, from, ancient, times, independently, of, their, views, on, evolution, but, their, explanations, differed, empedocles, did, not, believe, that, adaptation, required, a, final, cause, a, purpose, but, thought, that, it, came, about, naturally, since, such, things, survived, aristotle, did, believe, in, final, causes, but, assumed, that, species, were, fixed, in, natural, theology, adaptation, was, interpreted, as, the, work, of, a, deity, and, as, evidence, for, the, existence, of, god, william, paley, believed, that, organisms, were, perfectly, adapted, to, the, lives, they, led, an, argument, that, shadowed, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, who, had, argued, that, god, had, brought, about, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, voltaire, s, satire, dr, pangloss, is, a, parody, of, this, optimistic, idea, and, david, hume, also, argued, against, design, charles, darwin, broke, with, the, tradition, by, emphasising, the, flaws, and, limitations, which, occurred, in, the, animal, and, plant, worlds, jean, baptiste, lamarck, proposed, a, tendency, for, organisms, to, become, more, complex, moving, up, a, ladder, of, progress, plus, the, influence, of, circumstances, usually, expressed, as, use, and, disuse, this, second, subsidiary, element, of, his, theory, is, what, is, now, called, lamarckism, a, proto, evolutionary, hypothesis, of, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, intended, to, explain, adaptations, by, natural, means, other, natural, historians, such, as, buffon, accepted, adaptation, and, some, also, accepted, evolution, without, voicing, their, opinions, as, to, the, mechanism, this, illustrates, the, real, merit, of, darwin, and, alfred, russel, wallace, and, secondary, figures, such, as, henry, walter, bates, for, putting, forward, a, mechanism, whose, significance, had, only, been, glimpsed, previously, a, century, later, experimental, field, studies, and, breeding, experiments, by, people, such, as, e, b, ford, and, theodosius, dobzhansky, produced, evidence, that, natural, selection, was, not, only, the, engine, behind, adaptation, but, was, a, much, stronger, force, than, had, previously, been, thought, the, significance, of, an, adaptation, can, only, be, understood, in, relation, to, the, total, biology, of, the, species, adaptation, is, primarily, a, process, rather, than, a, physical, form, or, part, of, a, body, an, internal, parasite, such, as, a, liver, fluke, can, illustrate, the, distinction, such, a, parasite, may, have, a, very, simple, bodily, structure, but, nevertheless, the, organism, is, highly, adapted, to, its, specific, environment, from, this, we, see, that, adaptation, is, not, just, a, matter, of, visible, traits, in, such, parasites, critical, adaptations, take, place, in, the, life, cycle, which, is, often, quite, complex, however, as, a, practical, term, adaptation, often, refers, to, a, product, those, features, of, a, species, which, result, from, the, process, many, aspects, of, an, animal, or, plant, can, be, correctly, called, adaptations, though, there, are, always, some, features, whose, function, remains, in, doubt, by, using, the, term, adaptation, for, the, evolutionary, process, and, adaptive, trait, for, the, bodily, part, or, function, the, product, one, may, distinguish, the, two, different, senses, of, the, word, adaptation, is, one, of, the, two, main, processes, that, explain, the, observed, diversity, of, species, such, as, the, different, species, of, darwin, s, finches, the, other, process, is, speciation, in, which, new, species, arise, typically, through, reproductive, isolation, an, example, widely, used, today, to, study, the, interplay, of, adaptation, and, speciation, is, the, evolution, of, cichlid, fish, in, african, lakes, where, the, question, of, reproductive, isolation, is, complex, adaptation, is, not, always, a, simple, matter, where, the, ideal, phenotype, evolves, for, a, given, environment, an, organism, must, be, viable, at, all, stages, of, its, development, and, at, all, stages, of, its, evolution, this, places, constraints, on, the, evolution, of, development, behaviour, and, structure, of, organisms, the, main, constraint, over, which, there, has, been, much, debate, is, the, requirement, that, each, genetic, and, phenotypic, change, during, evolution, should, be, relatively, small, because, developmental, systems, are, so, complex, and, interlinked, however, it, is, not, clear, what, relatively, small, should, mean, for, example, polyploidy, in, plants, is, a, reasonably, common, large, genetic, change, the, origin, of, eukaryotic, endosymbiosis, is, a, more, dramatic, example, all, adaptations, help, organisms, survive, in, their, ecological, niches, the, adaptive, traits, may, be, structural, behavioural, or, physiological, structural, adaptations, are, physical, features, of, an, organism, such, as, shape, body, covering, armament, and, internal, organization, behavioural, adaptations, are, inherited, systems, of, behaviour, whether, inherited, in, detail, as, instincts, or, as, a, neuropsychological, capacity, for, learning, examples, include, searching, for, food, mating, and, vocalizations, physiological, adaptations, permit, the, organism, to, perform, special, functions, such, as, making, venom, secreting, slime, and, phototropism, but, also, involve, more, general, functions, such, as, growth, and, development, temperature, regulation, ionic, balance, and, other, aspects, of, homeostasis, adaptation, affects, all, aspects, of, the, life, of, an, organism, the, following, definitions, are, given, by, the, evolutionary, biologist, theodosius, dobzhansky, adaptation, differs, from, flexibility, acclimatization, and, learning, all, of, which, are, changes, during, life, which, are, not, inherited, flexibility, deals, with, the, relative, capacity, of, an, organism, to, maintain, itself, in, different, habitats, its, degree, of, specialization, acclimatization, describes, automatic, physiological, adjustments, during, life, learning, means, alteration, in, behavioural, performance, during, life, flexibility, stems, from, phenotypic, plasticity, the, ability, of, an, organism, with, a, given, genotype, genetic, type, to, change, its, phenotype, observable, characteristics, in, response, to, changes, in, its, habitat, or, to, move, to, a, different, habitat, the, degree, of, flexibility, is, inherited, and, varies, between, individuals, a, highly, specialized, animal, or, plant, lives, only, in, a, well, defined, habitat, eats, a, specific, type, of, food, and, cannot, survive, if, its, needs, are, not, met, many, herbivores, are, like, this, extreme, examples, are, koalas, which, depend, on, eucalyptus, and, giant, pandas, which, require, bamboo, a, generalist, on, the, other, hand, eats, a, range, of, food, and, can, survive, in, many, different, conditions, examples, are, humans, rats, crabs, and, many, carnivores, the, tendency, to, behave, in, a, specialized, or, exploratory, manner, is, inherited, it, is, an, adaptation, rather, different, is, developmental, flexibility, an, animal, or, plant, is, developmentally, flexible, if, when, it, is, raised, in, or, transferred, to, new, conditions, it, changes, in, structure, so, that, it, is, better, fitted, to, survive, in, the, new, environment, writes, the, evolutionary, biologist, john, maynard, smith, if, humans, move, to, a, higher, altitude, respiration, and, physical, exertion, become, a, problem, but, after, spending, time, in, high, altitude, conditions, they, acclimatize, to, the, reduced, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, such, as, by, producing, more, red, blood, cells, the, ability, to, acclimatize, is, an, adaptation, but, the, acclimatization, itself, is, not, the, reproductive, rate, declines, but, deaths, from, some, tropical, diseases, also, go, down, over, a, longer, period, of, time, some, people, are, better, able, to, reproduce, at, high, altitudes, than, others, they, contribute, more, heavily, to, later, generations, and, gradually, by, natural, selection, the, whole, population, becomes, adapted, to, the, new, conditions, this, has, demonstrably, occurred, as, the, observed, performance, of, long, term, communities, at, higher, altitude, is, significantly, better, than, the, performance, of, new, arrivals, even, when, the, new, arrivals, have, had, time, to, acclimatize, there, is, a, relationship, between, adaptedness, and, the, concept, of, fitness, used, in, population, genetics, differences, in, fitness, between, genotypes, predict, the, rate, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, natural, selection, changes, the, relative, frequencies, of, alternative, phenotypes, insofar, as, they, are, heritable, however, a, phenotype, with, high, adaptedness, may, not, have, high, fitness, dobzhansky, mentioned, the, example, of, the, californian, redwood, which, is, highly, adapted, but, a, relict, species, in, danger, of, extinction, elliott, sober, commented, that, adaptation, was, a, retrospective, concept, since, it, implied, something, about, the, history, of, a, trait, whereas, fitness, predicts, a, trait, s, future, sewall, wright, proposed, that, populations, occupy, adaptive, peaks, on, a, fitness, landscape, to, evolve, to, another, higher, peak, a, population, would, first, have, to, pass, through, a, valley, of, maladaptive, intermediate, stages, and, might, be, trapped, on, a, peak, that, is, not, optimally, adapted, adaptation, is, the, heart, and, soul, of, evolution, before, darwin, adaptation, was, seen, as, a, fixed, relationship, between, an, organism, and, its, habitat, it, was, not, appreciated, that, as, the, climate, changed, so, did, the, habitat, and, as, the, habitat, changed, so, did, the, biota, also, habitats, are, subject, to, changes, in, their, biota, for, example, invasions, of, species, from, other, areas, the, relative, numbers, of, species, in, a, given, habitat, are, always, changing, change, is, the, rule, though, much, depends, on, the, speed, and, degree, of, the, change, when, the, habitat, changes, three, main, things, may, happen, to, a, resident, population, habitat, tracking, genetic, change, or, extinction, in, fact, all, three, things, may, occur, in, sequence, of, these, three, effects, only, genetic, change, brings, about, adaptation, when, a, habitat, changes, the, resident, population, typically, moves, to, more, suitable, places, this, is, the, typical, response, of, flying, insects, or, oceanic, organisms, which, have, wide, though, not, unlimited, opportunity, for, movement, this, common, response, is, called, habitat, tracking, it, is, one, explanation, put, forward, for, the, periods, of, apparent, stasis, in, the, fossil, record, the, punctuated, equilibrium, theory, without, mutation, the, ultimate, source, of, all, genetic, variation, there, would, be, no, genetic, changes, and, no, subsequent, adaptation, through, evolution, by, natural, selection, genetic, change, occurs, in, a, population, when, mutation, increases, or, decreases, in, its, initial, frequency, followed, by, random, genetic, drift, migration, recombination, or, natural, selection, act, on, this, genetic, variation, one, example, is, that, the, first, pathways, of, enzyme, based, metabolism, at, the, very, origin, of, life, on, earth, may, have, been, co, opted, components, of, the, already, existing, purine, nucleotide, metabolism, a, metabolic, pathway, that, evolved, in, an, ancient, rna, world, the, co, option, requires, new, mutations, and, through, natural, selection, the, population, then, adapts, genetically, to, its, present, circumstances, genetic, changes, may, result, in, entirely, new, or, gradual, change, to, visible, structures, or, they, may, adjust, physiological, activity, in, a, way, that, suits, the, habitat, the, varying, shapes, of, the, beaks, of, darwin, s, finches, for, example, are, driven, by, adaptive, mutations, in, the, alx1, gene, the, coat, color, of, different, wild, mouse, species, matches, their, environments, whether, black, lava, or, light, sand, owing, to, adaptive, mutations, in, the, melanocortin, 1, receptor, and, other, melanin, pathway, genes, physiological, resistance, to, the, heart, poisons, cardiac, glycosides, that, monarch, butterflies, store, in, their, bodies, to, protect, themselves, from, predators, are, driven, by, adaptive, mutations, in, the, target, of, the, poison, the, sodium, pump, resulting, in, target, site, insensitivity, these, same, adaptive, mutations, and, similar, changes, at, the, same, amino, acid, sites, were, found, to, evolve, in, a, parallel, manner, in, distantly, related, insects, that, feed, on, the, same, plants, and, even, in, a, bird, that, feeds, on, monarchs, through, convergent, evolution, a, hallmark, of, adaptation, convergence, at, the, gene, level, across, distantly, related, species, can, arise, because, of, evolutionary, constraint, habitats, and, biota, do, frequently, change, over, time, and, space, therefore, it, follows, that, the, process, of, adaptation, is, never, fully, complete, over, time, it, may, happen, that, the, environment, changes, little, and, the, species, comes, to, fit, its, surroundings, better, and, better, resulting, in, stabilizing, selection, on, the, other, hand, it, may, happen, that, changes, in, the, environment, occur, suddenly, and, then, the, species, becomes, less, and, less, well, adapted, the, only, way, for, it, to, climb, back, up, that, fitness, peak, is, via, the, introduction, of, new, genetic, variation, for, natural, selection, to, act, upon, seen, like, this, adaptation, is, a, genetic, tracking, process, which, goes, on, all, the, time, to, some, extent, but, especially, when, the, population, cannot, or, does, not, move, to, another, less, hostile, area, given, enough, genetic, change, as, well, as, specific, demographic, conditions, an, adaptation, may, be, enough, to, bring, a, population, back, from, the, brink, of, extinction, in, a, process, called, evolutionary, rescue, adaptation, does, affect, to, some, extent, every, species, in, a, particular, ecosystem, leigh, van, valen, thought, that, even, in, a, stable, environment, because, of, antagonistic, species, interactions, and, limited, resources, a, species, must, constantly, had, to, adapt, to, maintain, its, relative, standing, this, became, known, as, the, red, queen, hypothesis, as, seen, in, host, parasite, interactions, existing, genetic, variation, and, mutation, were, the, traditional, sources, of, material, on, which, natural, selection, could, act, in, addition, horizontal, gene, transfer, is, possible, between, organisms, in, different, species, using, mechanisms, as, varied, as, gene, cassettes, plasmids, transposons, and, viruses, such, as, bacteriophages, in, coevolution, where, the, existence, of, one, species, is, tightly, bound, up, with, the, life, of, another, species, new, or, improved, adaptations, which, occur, in, one, species, are, often, followed, by, the, appearance, and, spread, of, corresponding, features, in, the, other, species, in, other, words, each, species, triggers, reciprocal, natural, selection, in, the, other, these, co, adaptational, relationships, are, intrinsically, dynamic, and, may, continue, on, a, trajectory, for, millions, of, years, as, has, occurred, in, the, relationship, between, flowering, plants, and, pollinating, insects, bates, work, on, amazonian, butterflies, led, him, to, develop, the, first, scientific, account, of, mimicry, especially, the, kind, of, mimicry, which, bears, his, name, batesian, mimicry, this, is, the, mimicry, by, a, palatable, species, of, an, unpalatable, or, noxious, species, the, model, gaining, a, selective, advantage, as, predators, avoid, the, model, and, therefore, also, the, mimic, mimicry, is, thus, an, anti, predator, adaptation, a, common, example, seen, in, temperate, gardens, is, the, hoverfly, syrphidae, many, of, which, though, bearing, no, sting, mimic, the, warning, coloration, of, aculeate, hymenoptera, wasps, and, bees, such, mimicry, does, not, need, to, be, perfect, to, improve, the, survival, of, the, palatable, species, bates, wallace, and, fritz, m, ller, believed, that, batesian, and, m, llerian, mimicry, provided, evidence, for, the, action, of, natural, selection, a, view, which, is, now, standard, amongst, biologists, all, adaptations, have, a, downside, horse, legs, are, great, for, running, on, grass, but, they, cannot, scratch, their, backs, mammals, hair, helps, temperature, but, offers, a, niche, for, ectoparasites, the, only, flying, penguins, do, is, under, water, adaptations, serving, different, functions, may, be, mutually, destructive, compromise, and, makeshift, occur, widely, not, perfection, selection, pressures, pull, in, different, directions, and, the, adaptation, that, results, is, some, kind, of, compromise, it, is, a, profound, truth, that, nature, does, not, know, best, that, genetical, evolution, is, a, story, of, waste, makeshift, compromise, and, blunder, since, the, phenotype, as, a, whole, is, the, target, of, selection, it, is, impossible, to, improve, simultaneously, all, aspects, of, the, phenotype, to, the, same, degree, consider, the, antlers, of, the, irish, elk, often, supposed, to, be, far, too, large, in, deer, antler, size, has, an, allometric, relationship, to, body, size, antlers, serve, positively, for, defence, against, predators, and, to, score, victories, in, the, annual, rut, but, they, are, costly, in, terms, of, resources, their, size, during, the, last, glacial, period, presumably, depended, on, the, relative, gain, and, loss, of, reproductive, capacity, in, the, population, of, elks, during, that, time, as, another, example, camouflage, to, avoid, detection, is, destroyed, when, vivid, coloration, is, displayed, at, mating, time, here, the, risk, to, life, is, counterbalanced, by, the, necessity, for, reproduction, stream, dwelling, salamanders, such, as, caucasian, salamander, or, gold, striped, salamander, have, very, slender, long, bodies, perfectly, adapted, to, life, at, the, banks, of, fast, small, rivers, and, mountain, brooks, elongated, body, protects, their, larvae, from, being, washed, out, by, current, however, elongated, body, increases, risk, of, desiccation, and, decreases, dispersal, ability, of, the, salamanders, it, also, negatively, affects, their, fecundity, as, a, result, fire, salamander, less, perfectly, adapted, to, the, mountain, brook, habitats, is, in, general, more, successful, have, a, higher, fecundity, and, broader, geographic, range, the, peacock, s, ornamental, train, grown, anew, in, time, for, each, mating, season, is, a, famous, adaptation, it, must, reduce, his, maneuverability, and, flight, and, is, hugely, conspicuous, also, its, growth, costs, food, resources, darwin, s, explanation, of, its, advantage, was, in, terms, of, sexual, selection, this, depends, on, the, advantage, which, certain, individuals, have, over, other, individuals, of, the, same, sex, and, species, in, exclusive, relation, to, reproduction, the, kind, of, sexual, selection, represented, by, the, peacock, is, called, mate, choice, with, an, implication, that, the, process, selects, the, more, fit, over, the, less, fit, and, so, has, survival, value, the, recognition, of, sexual, selection, was, for, a, long, time, in, abeyance, but, has, been, rehabilitated, the, conflict, between, the, size, of, the, human, foetal, brai, n, at, birth, which, cannot, be, larger, than, about, 400, cm, 3, else, it, will, not, get, through, the, mother, s, pelvis, and, the, size, needed, for, an, adult, brain, about, 1400, cm, 3, means, the, brain, of, a, newborn, child, is, quite, immature, the, most, vital, things, in, human, life, locomotion, speech, just, have, to, wait, while, the, brain, grows, and, matures, that, is, the, result, of, the, birth, compromise, much, of, the, problem, comes, from, our, upright, bipedal, stance, without, which, our, pelvis, could, be, shaped, more, suitably, for, birth, neanderthals, had, a, similar, problem, as, another, example, the, long, neck, of, a, giraffe, brings, benefits, but, at, a, cost, the, neck, of, a, giraffe, can, be, up, to, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, length, the, benefits, are, that, it, can, be, used, for, inter, species, competition, or, for, foraging, on, tall, trees, where, shorter, herbivores, cannot, reach, the, cost, is, that, a, long, neck, is, heavy, and, adds, to, the, animal, s, body, mass, requiring, additional, energy, to, build, the, neck, and, to, carry, its, weight, around, adaptation, and, function, are, two, aspects, of, one, problem, pre, adaptation, occurs, when, a, population, has, characteristics, which, by, chance, are, suited, for, a, set, of, conditions, not, previously, experienced, for, example, the, polyploid, cordgrass, spartina, townsendii, is, better, adapted, than, either, of, its, parent, species, to, their, own, habitat, of, saline, marsh, and, mud, flats, among, domestic, animals, the, white, leghorn, chicken, is, markedly, more, resistant, to, vitamin, b, 1, deficiency, than, other, breeds, on, a, plentiful, diet, this, makes, no, difference, but, on, a, restricted, diet, this, preadaptation, could, be, decisive, pre, adaptation, may, arise, because, a, natural, population, carries, a, huge, quantity, of, genetic, variability, in, diploid, eukaryotes, this, is, a, consequence, of, the, system, of, sexual, reproduction, where, mutant, alleles, get, partially, shielded, for, example, by, genetic, dominance, microorganisms, with, their, huge, populations, also, carry, a, great, deal, of, genetic, variability, the, first, experimental, evidence, of, the, pre, adaptive, nature, of, genetic, variants, in, microorganisms, was, provided, by, salvador, luria, and, max, delbr, ck, who, developed, the, fluctuation, test, a, method, to, show, the, random, fluctuation, of, pre, existing, genetic, changes, that, conferred, resistance, to, bacteriophages, in, escherichia, coli, the, word, is, controversial, because, it, is, teleological, and, the, entire, concept, of, natural, selection, depends, on, the, presence, of, genetic, variation, regardless, of, the, population, size, of, a, species, in, question, features, that, now, appear, as, adaptations, sometimes, arose, by, co, option, of, existing, traits, evolved, for, some, other, purpose, the, classic, example, is, the, ear, ossicles, of, mammals, which, we, know, from, paleontological, and, embryological, evidence, originated, in, the, upper, and, lower, jaws, and, the, hyoid, bone, of, their, synapsid, ancestors, and, further, back, still, were, part, of, the, gill, arches, of, early, fish, the, word, exaptation, was, coined, to, cover, these, common, evolutionary, shifts, in, function, the, flight, feathers, of, birds, evolved, from, the, much, earlier, feathers, of, dinosaurs, which, might, have, been, used, for, insulation, or, for, display, animals, including, earthworms, beavers, and, humans, use, some, of, their, adaptations, to, modify, their, surroundings, so, as, to, maximize, their, chances, of, surviving, and, reproducing, beavers, create, dams, and, lodges, changing, the, ecosystems, of, the, valleys, around, them, earthworms, as, darwin, noted, improve, the, topsoil, in, which, they, live, by, incorporating, organic, matter, humans, have, constructed, extensive, civilizations, with, cities, in, environments, as, varied, as, the, arctic, and, hot, deserts, in, all, three, cases, the, construction, and, maintenance, of, ecological, niches, helps, drive, the, continued, selection, of, the, genes, of, these, animals, in, an, environment, that, the, animals, have, modified, some, traits, do, not, appear, to, be, adaptive, as, they, have, a, neutral, or, deleterious, effect, on, fitness, in, the, current, environment, because, genes, often, have, pleiotropic, effects, not, all, traits, may, be, functional, they, may, be, what, stephen, jay, gould, and, richard, lewontin, called, spandrels, features, brought, about, by, neighbouring, adaptations, on, the, analogy, with, the, often, highly, decorated, triangular, areas, between, pairs, of, arches, in, architecture, which, began, as, functionless, features, another, possibility, is, that, a, trait, may, have, been, adaptive, at, some, point, in, an, organism, s, evolutionary, history, but, a, change, in, habitats, caused, what, used, to, be, an, adaptation, to, become, unnecessary, or, even, maladapted, such, adaptations, are, termed, vestigial, many, organisms, have, vestigial, organs, which, are, the, remnants, of, fully, functional, structures, in, their, ancestors, as, a, result, of, changes, in, lifestyle, the, organs, became, redundant, and, are, either, not, functional, or, reduced, in, functionality, since, any, structure, represents, some, kind, of, cost, to, the, general, economy, of, the, body, an, advantage, may, accrue, from, their, elimination, once, they, are, not, functional, examples, wisdom, teeth, in, humans, the, loss, of, pigment, and, functional, eyes, in, cave, fauna, the, loss, of, structure, in, endoparasites, if, a, population, cannot, move, or, change, sufficiently, to, preserve, its, long, term, viability, then, it, will, become, extinct, at, least, in, that, locale, the, species, may, or, may, not, survive, in, other, locales, species, extinction, occurs, when, the, death, rate, over, the, entire, species, exceeds, the, birth, rate, for, a, long, enough, period, for, the, species, to, disappear, it, was, an, observation, of, van, valen, that, groups, of, species, tend, to, have, a, characteristic, and, fairly, regular, rate, of, extinction, just, as, there, is, co, adaptation, there, is, also, coextinction, the, loss, of, a, species, due, to, the, extinction, of, another, with, which, it, is, coadapted, as, with, the, extinction, of, a, parasitic, insect, following, the, loss, of, its, host, or, when, a, flowering, plant, loses, its, pollinator, or, when, a, food, chain, is, disrupted, the, first, stage, in, the, evolution, of, life, on, earth, is, often, hypothesized, to, be, the, rna, world, in, which, short, self, replicating, rna, molecules, proliferated, before, the, evolution, of, dna, and, proteins, by, this, hypothesis, life, started, when, rna, chains, began, to, self, replicate, initiating, the, three, mechanisms, of, darwinian, selection, heritability, variation, of, type, and, competition, for, resources, the, fitness, of, an, rna, replicator, its, per, capita, rate, of, increase, would, likely, have, been, a, function, of, its, intrinsic, adaptive, capacities, determined, by, its, nucleotide, sequence, and, the, availability, of, resources, the, three, primary, adaptive, capacities, may, have, been, 1, replication, with, moderate, fidelity, giving, rise, to, heritability, while, allowing, variation, of, type, 2, resistance, to, decay, and, 3, acquisition, of, resources, these, adaptive, capacities, would, have, been, determined, by, the, folded, configurations, of, the, rna, replicators, resulting, from, their, nucleotide, sequences, adaptation, raises, philosophical, issues, concerning, how, biologists, speak, of, function, and, purpose, as, this, carries, implications, of, evolutionary, history, that, a, feature, evolved, by, natural, selection, for, a, specific, reason, and, potentially, of, supernatural, intervention, that, features, and, organisms, exist, because, of, a, deity, s, conscious, intentions, in, his, biology, aristotle, introduced, teleology, to, describe, the, adaptedness, of, organisms, but, without, accepting, the, supernatural, intention, built, into, plato, s, thinking, which, aristotle, rejected, modern, biologists, continue, to, face, the, same, difficulty, on, the, one, hand, adaptation, is, purposeful, natural, selection, chooses, what, works, and, eliminates, what, does, not, on, the, other, hand, biologists, by, and, large, reject, conscious, purpose, in, evolution, the, dilemma, gave, rise, to, a, famous, joke, by, the, evolutionary, biologist, haldane, teleology, is, like, a, mistress, to, a, biologist, he, cannot, live, without, her, but, he, s, unwilling, to, be, seen, with, her, in, public, david, hull, commented, that, haldane, s, mistress, has, become, a, lawfully, wedded, wife, biologists, no, longer, feel, obligated, to, apologize, for, their, use, of, teleological, language, they, flaunt, it, ernst, mayr, stated, that, adaptedness, is, a, posteriori, result, rather, than, an, a, priori, goal, seeking, meaning, that, the, question, of, whether, something, is, an, adaptation, can, only, be, determined, after, the, event
