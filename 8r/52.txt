an, antibody, ab, or, immunoglobulin, ig, is, a, large, y, shaped, protein, belonging, to, the, immunoglobulin, superfamily, which, is, used, by, the, immune, system, to, identify, and, neutralize, antigens, such, as, bacteria, and, viruses, including, those, that, cause, disease, antibodies, can, recognize, virtually, any, size, antigen, with, diverse, chemical, compositions, from, molecules, each, antibody, recognizes, one, or, more, specific, antigens, antigen, literally, means, antibody, generator, as, it, is, the, presence, of, an, antigen, that, drives, the, formation, of, an, antigen, specific, antibody, each, tip, of, the, y, of, an, antibody, contains, a, paratope, that, specifically, binds, to, one, particular, epitope, on, an, antigen, allowing, the, two, molecules, to, bind, together, with, precision, using, this, mechanism, antibodies, can, effectively, tag, a, microbe, or, an, infected, cell, for, attack, by, other, parts, of, the, immune, system, or, can, neutralize, it, directly, for, example, by, blocking, a, part, of, a, virus, that, is, essential, for, its, invasion, more, narrowly, an, antibody, ab, can, refer, to, the, free, secreted, form, of, these, proteins, as, opposed, to, the, membrane, bound, form, found, in, a, b, cell, receptor, the, term, immunoglobulin, can, then, refer, to, both, forms, since, they, are, broadly, speaking, the, same, protein, the, terms, are, often, treated, as, synonymous, to, allow, the, immune, system, to, recognize, millions, of, different, antigens, the, antigen, binding, sites, at, both, tips, of, the, antibody, come, in, an, equally, wide, variety, the, rest, of, the, antibody, structure, is, much, less, variable, in, humans, antibodies, occur, in, five, classes, sometimes, called, isotypes, iga, igd, ige, igg, and, igm, human, igg, and, iga, antibodies, are, also, divided, into, discrete, subclasses, igg1, igg2, igg3, igg4, iga1, and, iga2, the, class, refers, to, the, functions, triggered, by, the, antibody, also, known, as, effector, functions, in, addition, to, some, other, structural, features, antibodies, from, different, classes, also, differ, in, where, they, are, released, in, the, body, and, at, what, stage, of, an, immune, response, between, species, while, classes, and, subclasses, of, antibodies, may, be, shared, at, least, in, name, their, functions, and, distribution, throughout, the, body, may, be, different, for, example, mouse, igg1, is, closer, to, human, igg2, than, human, igg1, in, terms, of, its, function, the, term, humoral, immunity, is, often, treated, as, synonymous, with, the, antibody, response, describing, the, function, of, the, immune, system, that, exists, in, the, body, s, humors, fluids, in, the, form, of, soluble, proteins, as, distinct, from, cell, mediated, immunity, which, generally, describes, the, responses, of, t, cells, especially, cytotoxic, t, cells, in, general, antibodies, are, considered, part, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, though, this, classification, can, become, complicated, for, example, natural, igm, which, are, made, by, b, 1, lineage, cells, that, have, properties, more, similar, to, innate, immune, cells, than, adaptive, refers, to, igm, antibodies, made, independently, of, an, immune, response, that, demonstrate, polyreactivity, they, recognize, multiple, distinct, unrelated, antigens, these, can, work, with, the, complement, system, in, the, earliest, phases, of, an, immune, response, to, help, facilitate, clearance, of, the, offending, antigen, and, delivery, of, the, resulting, immune, complexes, to, the, lymph, nodes, or, spleen, for, initiation, of, an, immune, response, hence, in, this, capacity, the, function, of, antibodies, is, more, akin, to, that, of, innate, immunity, than, adaptive, nonetheless, in, general, antibodies, are, regarded, as, part, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, because, they, demonstrate, exceptional, specificity, with, some, exception, are, produced, through, genetic, rearrangements, rather, than, being, encoded, directly, in, germline, and, are, a, manifestation, of, immunological, memory, in, the, course, of, an, immune, response, b, cells, can, progressively, differentiate, into, antibody, secreting, cells, or, into, memory, b, cells, antibody, secreting, cells, comprise, plasmablasts, and, plasma, cells, which, differ, mainly, in, the, degree, to, which, they, secrete, antibody, their, lifespan, metabolic, adaptations, and, surface, markers, plasmablasts, are, rapidly, proliferating, short, lived, cells, produced, in, the, early, phases, of, the, immune, response, classically, described, as, arising, extrafollicularly, rather, than, from, the, germinal, center, which, have, the, potential, to, differentiate, further, into, plasma, cells, the, literature, is, sloppy, at, times, and, often, describes, plasmablasts, as, just, short, lived, plasma, cells, formally, this, is, incorrect, plasma, cells, in, contrast, do, not, divide, they, are, terminally, differentiated, and, rely, on, survival, niches, comprising, specific, cell, types, and, cytokines, to, persist, plasma, cells, will, secrete, huge, quantities, of, antibody, regardless, of, whether, or, not, their, cognate, antigen, is, present, ensuring, that, antibody, levels, to, the, antigen, in, question, do, not, fall, to, 0, provided, the, plasma, cell, stays, alive, the, rate, of, antibody, secretion, however, can, be, regulated, for, example, by, the, presence, of, adjuvant, molecules, that, stimulate, the, immune, response, such, as, tlr, ligands, long, lived, plasma, cells, can, live, for, potentially, the, entire, lifetime, of, the, organism, classically, the, survival, niches, that, house, long, lived, plasma, cells, reside, in, the, bone, marrow, though, it, cannot, be, assumed, that, any, given, plasma, cell, in, the, bone, marrow, will, be, long, lived, however, other, work, indicates, that, survival, niches, can, readily, be, established, within, the, mucosal, tissues, though, the, classes, of, antibodies, involved, show, a, different, hierarchy, from, those, in, the, bone, marrow, b, cells, can, also, differentiate, into, memory, b, cells, which, can, persist, for, decades, similarly, to, long, lived, plasma, cells, these, cells, can, be, rapidly, recalled, in, a, secondary, immune, response, undergoing, class, switching, affinity, maturation, and, differentiating, into, antibody, secreting, cells, antibodies, are, central, to, the, immune, protection, elicited, by, most, vaccines, and, infections, although, other, components, of, the, immune, system, certainly, participate, and, for, some, diseases, are, considerably, more, important, than, antibodies, in, generating, an, immune, response, e, g, herpes, zoster, durable, protection, from, infections, caused, by, a, given, microbe, that, is, the, ability, of, the, microbe, to, enter, the, body, and, begin, to, replicate, not, necessarily, to, cause, disease, depends, on, sustained, production, of, large, quantities, of, antibodies, meaning, that, effective, vaccines, ideally, elicit, persistent, high, levels, of, antibody, which, relies, on, long, lived, plasma, cells, at, the, same, time, many, microbes, of, medical, importance, have, the, ability, to, mutate, to, escape, antibodies, elicited, by, prior, infections, and, long, lived, plasma, cells, cannot, undergo, affinity, maturation, or, class, switching, this, is, compensated, for, through, memory, b, cells, novel, variants, of, a, microbe, that, still, retain, structural, features, of, previously, encountered, antigens, can, elicit, memory, b, cell, responses, that, adapt, to, those, changes, it, has, been, suggested, that, long, lived, plasma, cells, secrete, b, cell, receptors, with, higher, affinity, than, those, on, the, surfaces, of, memory, b, cells, but, findings, are, not, entirely, consistent, on, this, point, antibodies, are, heavy, 150, k, da, proteins, of, about, 10, nm, in, size, arranged, in, three, globular, regions, that, roughly, form, a, y, shape, in, humans, and, most, other, mammals, an, antibody, unit, consists, of, four, polypeptide, chains, two, identical, heavy, chains, and, two, identical, light, chains, connected, by, disulfide, bonds, each, chain, is, a, series, of, domains, somewhat, similar, sequences, of, about, 110, amino, acids, each, these, domains, are, usually, represented, in, simplified, schematics, as, rectangles, light, chains, consist, of, one, variable, domain, v, l, and, one, constant, domain, c, l, while, heavy, chains, contain, one, variable, domain, v, h, and, three, to, four, constant, domains, c, h, 1, c, h, 2, structurally, an, antibody, is, also, partitioned, into, two, antigen, binding, fragments, fab, containing, one, v, l, v, h, c, l, and, c, h, 1, domain, each, as, well, as, the, crystallisable, fragment, fc, forming, the, trunk, of, the, y, shape, in, between, them, is, a, hinge, region, of, the, heavy, chains, whose, flexibility, allows, antibodies, to, bind, to, pairs, of, epitopes, at, various, distances, to, form, complexes, dimers, trimers, etc, and, to, bind, effector, molecules, more, easily, in, an, electrophoresis, test, of, blood, proteins, antibodies, mostly, migrate, to, the, last, gamma, globulin, fraction, conversely, most, gamma, globulins, are, antibodies, which, is, why, the, two, terms, were, historically, used, as, synonyms, as, were, the, symbols, ig, and, this, variant, terminology, fell, out, of, use, due, to, the, correspondence, being, inexact, and, due, to, confusion, with, gamma, heavy, chains, which, characterize, the, igg, class, of, antibodies, the, variable, domains, can, also, be, referred, to, as, the, f, v, region, it, is, the, subregion, of, fab, that, binds, to, an, antigen, more, specifically, each, variable, domain, contains, three, hypervariable, regions, the, amino, acids, seen, there, vary, the, most, from, antibody, to, antibody, when, the, protein, folds, these, regions, give, rise, to, three, loops, of, strands, localized, near, one, another, on, the, surface, of, the, antibody, these, loops, are, referred, to, as, the, complementarity, determining, regions, cdrs, since, their, shape, complements, that, of, an, antigen, three, cdrs, from, each, of, the, heavy, and, light, chains, together, form, an, antibody, binding, site, whose, shape, can, be, anything, from, a, pocket, to, which, a, smaller, antigen, binds, to, a, larger, surface, to, a, protrusion, that, sticks, out, into, a, groove, in, an, antigen, typically, though, only, a, few, residues, contribute, to, most, of, the, binding, energy, the, existence, of, two, identical, antibody, binding, sites, allows, antibody, molecules, to, bind, strongly, to, multivalent, antigen, repeating, sites, such, as, polysaccharides, in, bacterial, cell, walls, or, other, sites, at, some, distance, apart, as, well, as, to, form, antibody, complexes, and, larger, antigen, antibody, complexes, the, structures, of, cdrs, have, been, clustered, and, classified, by, chothia, et, al, and, more, recently, by, north, et, al, and, nikoloudis, et, al, however, describing, an, antibody, s, binding, site, using, only, one, single, static, structure, limits, the, understanding, and, characterization, of, the, antibody, s, function, and, properties, to, improve, antibody, structure, prediction, and, to, take, the, strongly, correlated, cdr, loop, and, interface, movements, into, account, antibody, paratopes, should, be, described, as, interconverting, states, in, solution, with, varying, probabilities, in, the, framework, of, the, immune, network, theory, cdrs, are, also, called, idiotypes, according, to, immune, network, theory, the, adaptive, immune, system, is, regulated, by, interactions, between, idiotypes, the, fc, region, the, trunk, of, the, y, shape, is, composed, of, constant, domains, from, the, heavy, chains, its, role, is, in, modulating, immune, cell, activity, it, is, where, effector, molecules, bind, to, triggering, various, effects, after, the, antibody, fab, region, binds, to, an, antigen, effector, cells, such, as, macrophages, or, natural, killer, cells, bind, via, their, fc, receptors, fcr, to, the, fc, region, of, an, antibody, while, the, complement, system, is, activated, by, binding, the, c1q, protein, complex, igg, or, igm, can, bind, to, c1q, but, iga, cannot, therefore, iga, does, not, activate, the, classical, complement, pathway, another, role, of, the, fc, region, is, to, selectively, distribute, different, antibody, classes, across, the, body, in, particular, the, neonatal, fc, receptor, fcrn, binds, to, the, fc, region, of, igg, antibodies, to, transport, it, across, the, placenta, from, the, mother, to, the, fetus, in, addition, to, this, binding, to, fcrn, endows, igg, with, an, exceptionally, long, half, life, relative, to, other, plasma, proteins, of, 3, 4, weeks, igg3, in, most, cases, depending, on, allotype, has, mutations, at, the, fcrn, binding, site, which, lower, affinity, for, fcrn, which, are, thought, to, have, evolved, to, limit, the, highly, inflammatory, effects, of, this, subclass, antibodies, are, glycoproteins, that, is, they, have, carbohydrates, glycans, added, to, conserved, amino, acid, residues, these, conserved, glycosylation, sites, occur, in, the, fc, region, and, influence, interactions, with, effector, molecules, the, n, terminus, of, each, chain, is, situated, at, the, tip, each, immunoglobulin, domain, has, a, similar, structure, characteristic, of, all, the, members, of, the, immunoglobulin, superfamily, it, is, composed, of, between, 7, for, constant, domains, and, 9, for, variable, domains, strands, forming, two, beta, sheets, in, a, greek, key, motif, the, sheets, create, a, sandwich, shape, the, immunoglobulin, fold, held, together, by, a, disulfide, bond, secreted, antibodies, can, occur, as, a, single, y, shaped, unit, a, monomer, however, some, antibody, classes, also, form, dimers, with, two, ig, units, as, with, iga, tetramers, with, four, ig, units, like, teleost, fish, igm, or, pentamers, with, five, ig, units, like, shark, igw, or, mammalian, igm, which, occasionally, forms, hexamers, as, well, with, six, units, igg, can, also, form, hexamers, though, no, j, chain, is, required, iga, tetramers, and, pentamers, have, also, been, reported, antibodies, also, form, complexes, by, binding, to, antigen, this, is, called, an, antigen, antibody, complex, or, immune, complex, small, antigens, can, cross, link, two, antibodies, also, leading, to, the, formation, of, antibody, dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc, multivalent, antigens, e, g, cells, with, multiple, epitopes, can, form, larger, complexes, with, antibodies, an, extreme, example, is, the, clumping, or, agglutination, of, red, blood, cells, with, antibodies, in, blood, typing, to, determine, blood, groups, the, large, clumps, become, insoluble, leading, to, visually, apparent, precipitation, the, membrane, bound, form, of, an, antibody, may, be, called, a, surface, immunoglobulin, sig, or, a, membrane, immunoglobulin, mig, it, is, part, of, the, b, cell, receptor, bcr, which, allows, a, b, cell, to, detect, when, a, specific, antigen, is, present, in, the, body, and, triggers, b, cell, activation, the, bcr, is, composed, of, surface, bound, igd, or, igm, antibodies, and, associated, ig, and, ig, heterodimers, which, are, capable, of, signal, transduction, a, typical, human, b, cell, will, have, 50, 000, to, 100, 000, antibodies, bound, to, its, surface, upon, antigen, binding, they, cluster, in, large, patches, which, can, exceed, 1, micrometer, in, diameter, on, lipid, rafts, that, isolate, the, bcrs, from, most, other, cell, signaling, receptors, these, patches, may, improve, the, efficiency, of, the, cellular, immune, response, in, humans, the, cell, surface, is, bare, around, the, b, cell, receptors, for, several, hundred, nanometers, which, further, isolates, the, bcrs, from, competing, influences, antibodies, can, come, in, different, varieties, known, as, isotypes, or, classes, in, humans, there, are, five, antibody, classes, known, as, iga, igd, ige, igg, and, igm, which, are, further, subdivided, into, subclasses, such, as, iga1, iga2, the, prefix, ig, stands, for, immunoglobulin, while, the, suffix, denotes, the, type, of, heavy, chain, the, antibody, contains, the, heavy, chain, types, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, mu, give, rise, to, iga, igg, igd, ige, igm, respectively, the, distinctive, features, of, each, class, are, determined, by, the, part, of, the, heavy, chain, within, the, hinge, and, fc, region, the, classes, differ, in, their, biological, properties, functional, locations, and, ability, to, deal, with, different, antigens, as, depicted, in, the, table, for, example, ige, antibodies, are, responsible, for, an, allergic, response, consisting, of, histamine, release, from, mast, cells, often, a, sole, contributor, to, asthma, though, other, pathways, exist, as, do, exist, symptoms, very, similar, to, yet, not, technically, asthma, the, antibody, s, variable, region, binds, to, allergic, antigen, for, example, house, dust, mite, particles, while, its, fc, region, in, the, heavy, chains, binds, to, fc, receptor, on, a, mast, cell, triggering, its, degranulation, the, release, of, molecules, stored, in, its, granules, the, antibody, isotype, of, a, b, cell, changes, during, cell, development, and, activation, immature, b, cells, which, have, never, been, exposed, to, an, antigen, express, only, the, igm, isotype, in, a, cell, surface, bound, form, the, b, lymphocyte, in, this, ready, to, respond, form, is, known, as, a, naive, b, lymphocyte, the, naive, b, lymphocyte, expresses, both, surface, igm, and, igd, the, co, expression, of, both, of, these, immunoglobulin, isotypes, renders, the, b, cell, ready, to, respond, to, antigen, b, cell, activation, follows, engagement, of, the, cell, bound, antibody, molecule, with, an, antigen, causing, the, cell, to, divide, and, differentiate, into, an, antibody, producing, cell, called, a, plasma, cell, in, this, activated, form, the, b, cell, starts, to, produce, antibody, in, a, secreted, form, rather, than, a, membrane, bound, form, some, daughter, cells, of, the, activated, b, cells, undergo, isotype, switching, a, mechanism, that, causes, the, production, of, antibodies, to, change, from, igm, or, igd, to, the, other, antibody, isotypes, ige, iga, or, igg, that, have, defined, roles, in, the, immune, system, in, mammals, there, are, two, types, of, immunoglobulin, light, chain, which, are, called, lambda, and, kappa, however, there, is, no, known, functional, difference, between, them, and, both, can, occur, with, any, of, the, five, major, types, of, heavy, chains, each, antibody, contains, two, identical, light, chains, both, or, both, proportions, of, and, types, vary, by, species, and, can, be, used, to, detect, abnormal, proliferation, of, b, cell, clones, other, types, of, light, chains, such, as, the, iota, chain, are, found, in, other, vertebrates, like, sharks, chondrichthyes, and, bony, fishes, teleostei, in, most, placental, mammals, the, structure, of, antibodies, is, generally, the, same, jawed, fish, appear, to, be, the, most, primitive, animals, that, are, able, to, make, antibodies, similar, to, those, of, mammals, although, many, features, of, their, adaptive, immunity, appeared, somewhat, earlier, cartilaginous, fish, such, as, sharks, produce, heavy, chain, only, antibodies, i, e, lacking, light, chains, which, moreover, feature, longer, chain, pentamers, with, five, constant, units, per, molecule, camelids, such, as, camels, llamas, alpacas, are, also, notable, for, producing, heavy, chain, only, antibodies, the, antibody, s, paratope, interacts, with, the, antigen, s, epitope, an, antigen, usually, contains, different, epitopes, along, its, surface, arranged, discontinuously, and, dominant, epitopes, on, a, given, antigen, are, called, determinants, antibody, and, antigen, interact, by, spatial, complementarity, lock, and, key, the, molecular, forces, involved, in, the, fab, epitope, interaction, are, weak, and, non, specific, for, example, electrostatic, forces, hydrogen, bonds, hydrophobic, interactions, and, van, der, waals, forces, this, means, binding, between, antibody, and, antigen, is, reversible, and, the, antibody, s, affinity, towards, an, antigen, is, relative, rather, than, absolute, relatively, weak, binding, also, means, it, is, possible, for, an, antibody, to, cross, react, with, different, antigens, of, different, relative, affinities, the, main, categories, of, antibody, action, include, the, following, more, indirectly, an, antibody, can, signal, immune, cells, to, present, antibody, fragments, to, t, cells, or, downregulate, other, immune, cells, to, avoid, autoimmunity, activated, b, cells, differentiate, into, either, antibody, producing, cells, called, plasma, cells, that, secrete, soluble, antibody, or, memory, cells, that, survive, in, the, body, for, years, afterward, in, order, to, allow, the, immune, system, to, remember, an, antigen, and, respond, faster, upon, future, exposures, at, the, prenatal, and, neonatal, stages, of, life, the, presence, of, antibodies, is, provided, by, passive, immunization, from, the, mother, early, endogenous, antibody, production, varies, for, different, kinds, of, antibodies, and, usually, appear, within, the, first, years, of, life, since, antibodies, exist, freely, in, the, bloodstream, they, are, said, to, be, part, of, the, humoral, immune, system, circulating, antibodies, are, produced, by, clonal, b, cells, that, specifically, respond, to, only, one, antigen, an, example, is, a, virus, capsid, protein, fragment, antibodies, contribute, to, immunity, in, three, ways, they, prevent, pathogens, from, entering, or, damaging, cells, by, binding, to, them, they, stimulate, removal, of, pathogens, by, macrophages, and, other, cells, by, coating, the, pathogen, and, they, trigger, destruction, of, pathogens, by, stimulating, other, immune, responses, such, as, the, complement, pathway, antibodies, will, also, trigger, vasoactive, amine, degranulation, to, contribute, to, immunity, against, certain, types, of, antigens, helminths, allergens, antibodies, that, bind, to, surface, antigens, for, example, on, bacteria, will, attract, the, first, component, of, the, complement, cascade, with, their, fc, region, and, initiate, activation, of, the, classical, complement, system, this, results, in, the, killing, of, bacteria, in, two, ways, first, the, binding, of, the, antibody, and, complement, molecules, marks, the, microbe, for, ingestion, by, phagocytes, in, a, process, called, opsonization, these, phagocytes, are, attracted, by, certain, complement, molecules, generated, in, the, complement, cascade, second, some, complement, system, components, form, a, membrane, attack, complex, to, assist, antibodies, to, kill, the, bacterium, directly, bacteriolysis, to, combat, pathogens, that, replicate, outside, cells, antibodies, bind, to, pathogens, to, link, them, together, causing, them, to, agglutinate, since, an, antibody, has, at, least, two, paratopes, it, can, bind, more, than, one, antigen, by, binding, identical, epitopes, carried, on, the, surfaces, of, these, antigens, by, coating, the, pathogen, antibodies, stimulate, effector, functions, against, the, pathogen, in, cells, that, recognize, their, fc, region, those, cells, that, recognize, coated, pathogens, have, fc, receptors, which, as, the, name, suggests, interact, with, the, fc, region, of, iga, igg, and, ige, antibodies, the, engagement, of, a, particular, antibody, with, the, fc, receptor, on, a, particular, cell, triggers, an, effector, function, of, that, cell, phagocytes, will, phagocytose, mast, cells, and, neutrophils, will, degranulate, natural, killer, cells, will, release, cytokines, and, cytotoxic, molecules, that, will, ultimately, result, in, destruction, of, the, invading, microbe, the, activation, of, natural, killer, cells, by, antibodies, initiates, a, cytotoxic, mechanism, known, as, antibody, dependent, cell, mediated, cytotoxicity, adcc, this, process, may, explain, the, efficacy, of, monoclonal, antibodies, used, in, biological, therapies, against, cancer, the, fc, receptors, are, isotype, specific, which, gives, greater, flexibility, to, the, immune, system, invoking, only, the, appropriate, immune, mechanisms, for, distinct, pathogens, humans, and, higher, primates, also, produce, natural, antibodies, that, are, present, in, serum, before, viral, infection, natural, antibodies, have, been, defined, as, antibodies, that, are, produced, without, any, previous, infection, vaccination, other, foreign, antigen, exposure, or, passive, immunization, these, antibodies, can, activate, the, classical, complement, pathway, leading, to, lysis, of, enveloped, virus, particles, long, before, the, adaptive, immune, response, is, activated, many, natural, antibodies, are, directed, against, the, disaccharide, galactose, 1, 3, galactose, gal, which, is, found, as, a, terminal, sugar, on, glycosylated, cell, surface, proteins, and, generated, in, response, to, production, of, this, sugar, by, bacteria, contained, in, the, human, gut, rejection, of, xenotransplantated, organs, is, thought, to, be, in, part, the, result, of, natural, antibodies, circulating, in, the, serum, of, the, recipient, binding, to, gal, antigens, expressed, on, the, donor, tissue, virtually, all, microbes, can, trigger, an, antibody, response, successful, recognition, and, eradication, of, many, different, types, of, microbes, requires, diversity, among, antibodies, their, amino, acid, composition, varies, allowing, them, to, interact, with, many, different, antigens, it, has, been, estimated, that, humans, generate, about, 10, billion, different, antibodies, each, capable, of, binding, a, distinct, epitope, of, an, antigen, although, a, huge, repertoire, of, different, antibodies, is, generated, in, a, single, individual, the, number, of, genes, available, to, make, these, proteins, is, limited, by, the, size, of, the, human, genome, several, complex, genetic, mechanisms, have, evolved, that, allow, vertebrate, b, cells, to, generate, a, diverse, pool, of, antibodies, from, a, relatively, small, number, of, antibody, genes, the, chromosomal, region, that, encodes, an, antibody, is, large, and, contains, several, distinct, gene, loci, for, each, domain, of, the, antibody, the, chromosome, region, containing, heavy, chain, genes, igh, is, found, on, chromosome, 14, and, the, loci, containing, lambda, and, kappa, light, chain, genes, igl, and, igk, are, found, on, chromosomes, 22, and, 2, in, humans, one, of, these, domains, is, called, the, variable, domain, which, is, present, in, each, heavy, and, light, chain, of, every, antibody, but, can, differ, in, different, antibodies, generated, from, distinct, b, cells, differences, between, the, variable, domains, are, located, on, three, loops, known, as, hypervariable, regions, hv, 1, hv, 2, and, hv, 3, or, complementarity, determining, regions, cdr1, cdr2, and, cdr3, cdrs, are, supported, within, the, variable, domains, by, conserved, framework, regions, the, heavy, chain, locus, contains, about, 65, different, variable, domain, genes, that, all, differ, in, their, cdrs, combining, these, genes, with, an, array, of, genes, for, other, domains, of, the, antibody, generates, a, large, cavalry, of, antibodies, with, a, high, degree, of, variability, this, combination, is, called, v, d, j, recombination, discussed, below, somatic, recombination, of, immunoglobulins, also, known, as, v, d, j, recombination, involves, the, generation, of, a, unique, immunoglobulin, variable, region, the, variable, region, of, each, immunoglobulin, heavy, or, light, chain, is, encoded, in, several, pieces, known, as, gene, segments, subgenes, these, segments, are, called, variable, v, diversity, d, and, joining, j, segments, v, d, and, j, segments, are, found, in, ig, heavy, chains, but, only, v, and, j, segments, are, found, in, ig, light, chains, multiple, copies, of, the, v, d, and, j, gene, segments, exist, and, are, tandemly, arranged, in, the, genomes, of, mammals, in, the, bone, marrow, each, developing, b, cell, will, assemble, an, immunoglobulin, variable, region, by, randomly, selecting, and, combining, one, v, one, d, and, one, j, gene, segment, or, one, v, and, one, j, segment, in, the, light, chain, as, there, are, multiple, copies, of, each, type, of, gene, segment, and, different, combinations, of, gene, segments, can, be, used, to, generate, each, immunoglobulin, variable, region, this, process, generates, a, huge, number, of, antibodies, each, with, different, paratopes, and, thus, different, antigen, specificities, the, rearrangement, of, several, subgenes, i, e, v2, family, for, lambda, light, chain, immunoglobulin, is, coupled, with, the, activation, of, microrna, mir, 650, which, further, influences, biology, of, b, cells, rag, proteins, play, an, important, role, with, v, d, j, recombination, in, cutting, dna, at, a, particular, region, without, the, presence, of, these, proteins, v, d, j, recombination, would, not, occur, after, a, b, cell, produces, a, functional, immunoglobulin, gene, during, v, d, j, recombination, it, cannot, express, any, other, variable, region, a, process, known, as, allelic, exclusion, thus, each, b, cell, can, produce, antibodies, containing, only, one, kind, of, variable, chain, following, activation, with, antigen, b, cells, begin, to, proliferate, rapidly, in, these, rapidly, dividing, cells, the, genes, encoding, the, variable, domains, of, the, heavy, and, light, chains, undergo, a, high, rate, of, point, mutation, by, a, process, called, somatic, hypermutation, shm, shm, results, in, approximately, one, nucleotide, change, per, variable, gene, per, cell, division, as, a, consequence, any, daughter, b, cells, will, acquire, slight, amino, acid, differences, in, the, variable, domains, of, their, antibody, chains, this, serves, to, increase, the, diversity, of, the, antibody, pool, and, impacts, the, antibody, s, antigen, binding, affinity, some, point, mutations, will, result, in, the, production, of, antibodies, that, have, a, weaker, interaction, low, affinity, with, their, antigen, than, the, original, antibody, and, some, mutations, will, generate, antibodies, with, a, stronger, interaction, high, affinity, b, cells, that, express, high, affinity, antibodies, on, their, surface, will, receive, a, strong, survival, signal, during, interactions, with, other, cells, whereas, those, with, low, affinity, antibodies, will, not, and, will, die, by, apoptosis, thus, b, cells, expressing, antibodies, with, a, higher, affinity, for, the, antigen, will, outcompete, those, with, weaker, affinities, for, function, and, survival, allowing, the, average, affinity, of, antibodies, to, increase, over, time, the, process, of, generating, antibodies, with, increased, binding, affinities, is, called, affinity, maturation, affinity, maturation, occurs, in, mature, b, cells, after, v, d, j, recombination, and, is, dependent, on, help, from, helper, t, cells, isotype, or, class, switching, is, a, biological, process, occurring, after, activation, of, the, b, cell, which, allows, the, cell, to, produce, different, classes, of, antibody, iga, ige, or, igg, the, different, classes, of, antibody, and, thus, effector, functions, are, defined, by, the, constant, c, regions, of, the, immunoglobulin, heavy, chain, initially, naive, b, cells, express, only, cell, surface, igm, and, igd, with, identical, antigen, binding, regions, each, isotype, is, adapted, for, a, distinct, function, therefore, after, activation, an, antibody, with, an, igg, iga, or, ige, effector, function, might, be, required, to, effectively, eliminate, an, antigen, class, switching, allows, different, daughter, cells, from, the, same, activated, b, cell, to, produce, antibodies, of, different, isotypes, only, the, constant, region, of, the, antibody, heavy, chain, changes, during, class, switching, the, variable, regions, and, therefore, antigen, specificity, remain, unchanged, thus, the, progeny, of, a, single, b, cell, can, produce, antibodies, all, specific, for, the, same, antigen, but, with, the, ability, to, produce, the, effector, function, appropriate, for, each, antigenic, challenge, class, switching, is, triggered, by, cytokines, the, isotype, generated, depends, on, which, cytokines, are, present, in, the, b, cell, environment, class, switching, occurs, in, the, heavy, chain, gene, locus, by, a, mechanism, called, class, switch, recombination, csr, this, mechanism, relies, on, conserved, nucleotide, motifs, called, switch, s, regions, found, in, dna, upstream, of, each, constant, region, gene, except, in, the, chain, the, dna, strand, is, broken, by, the, activity, of, a, series, of, enzymes, at, two, selected, s, regions, the, variable, domain, exon, is, rejoined, through, a, process, called, non, homologous, end, joining, nhej, to, the, desired, constant, region, or, this, process, results, in, an, immunoglobulin, gene, that, encodes, an, antibody, of, a, different, isotype, an, antibody, can, be, called, monospecific, if, it, has, specificity, for, a, single, antigen, or, epitope, or, bispecific, if, it, has, affinity, for, two, different, antigens, or, two, different, epitopes, on, the, same, antigen, a, group, of, antibodies, can, be, called, polyvalent, or, unspecific, if, they, have, affinity, for, various, antigens, or, microorganisms, intravenous, immunoglobulin, if, not, otherwise, noted, consists, of, a, variety, of, different, igg, polyclonal, igg, in, contrast, monoclonal, antibodies, are, identical, antibodies, produced, by, a, single, b, cell, heterodimeric, antibodies, which, are, also, asymmetrical, antibodies, allow, for, greater, flexibility, and, new, formats, for, attaching, a, variety, of, drugs, to, the, antibody, arms, one, of, the, general, formats, for, a, heterodimeric, antibody, is, the, knobs, into, holes, format, this, format, is, specific, to, the, heavy, chain, part, of, the, constant, region, in, antibodies, the, knobs, part, is, engineered, by, replacing, a, small, amino, acid, with, a, larger, one, it, fits, into, the, hole, which, is, engineered, by, replacing, a, large, amino, acid, with, a, smaller, one, what, connects, the, knobs, to, the, holes, are, the, disulfide, bonds, between, each, chain, the, knobs, into, holes, shape, facilitates, antibody, dependent, cell, mediated, cytotoxicity, single, chain, variable, fragments, scfv, are, connected, to, the, variable, domain, of, the, heavy, and, light, chain, via, a, short, linker, peptide, the, linker, is, rich, in, glycine, which, gives, it, more, flexibility, and, serine, threonine, which, gives, it, specificity, two, different, scfv, fragments, can, be, connected, together, via, a, hinge, region, to, the, constant, domain, of, the, heavy, chain, or, the, constant, domain, of, the, light, chain, this, gives, the, antibody, bispecificity, allowing, for, the, binding, specificities, of, two, different, antigens, the, knobs, into, holes, format, enhances, heterodimer, formation, but, does, not, suppress, homodimer, formation, to, further, improve, the, function, of, heterodimeric, antibodies, many, scientists, are, looking, towards, artificial, constructs, artificial, antibodies, are, largely, diverse, protein, motifs, that, use, the, functional, strategy, of, the, antibody, molecule, but, are, not, limited, by, the, loop, and, framework, structural, constraints, of, the, natural, antibody, being, able, to, control, the, combinational, design, of, the, sequence, and, three, dimensional, space, could, transcend, the, natural, design, and, allow, for, the, attachment, of, different, combinations, of, drugs, to, the, arms, heterodimeric, antibodies, have, a, greater, range, in, shapes, they, can, take, and, the, drugs, that, are, attached, to, the, arms, do, not, have, to, be, the, same, on, each, arm, allowing, for, different, combinations, of, drugs, to, be, used, in, cancer, treatment, pharmaceuticals, are, able, to, produce, highly, functional, bispecific, and, even, multispecific, antibodies, the, degree, to, which, they, can, function, is, impressive, given, that, such, a, change, of, shape, from, the, natural, form, should, lead, to, decreased, functionality, antibody, diversification, typically, occurs, through, somatic, hypermutation, class, switching, and, affinity, maturation, targeting, the, bcr, gene, loci, but, on, occasion, more, unconventional, forms, of, diversification, have, been, documented, for, example, in, the, case, of, malaria, caused, by, plasmodium, falciparum, some, antibodies, from, those, who, had, been, infected, demonstrated, an, insertion, from, chromosome, 19, containing, a, 98, amino, acid, stretch, from, leukocyte, associated, immunoglobulin, like, receptor, 1, lair1, in, the, elbow, joint, this, represents, a, form, of, interchromosomal, transposition, lair1, normally, binds, collagen, but, can, recognize, repetitive, interspersed, families, of, polypeptides, rifin, family, members, that, are, highly, expressed, on, the, surface, of, p, falciparum, infected, red, blood, cells, in, fact, these, antibodies, underwent, affinity, maturation, that, enhanced, affinity, for, rifin, but, abolished, affinity, for, collagen, these, lair1, containing, antibodies, have, been, found, in, 5, 10, of, donors, from, tanzania, and, mali, though, not, in, european, donors, european, donors, did, show, 100, 1000, nucleotide, stretches, inside, the, elbow, joints, as, well, however, this, particular, phenomenon, may, be, specific, to, malaria, as, infection, is, known, to, induce, genomic, instability, the, first, use, of, the, term, antibody, occurred, in, a, text, by, paul, ehrlich, the, term, antik, rper, the, german, word, for, antibody, appears, in, the, conclusion, of, his, article, experimental, studies, on, immunity, published, in, october, 1891, which, states, that, if, two, substances, give, rise, to, two, different, antik, rper, then, they, themselves, must, be, different, however, the, term, was, not, accepted, immediately, and, several, other, terms, for, antibody, were, proposed, these, included, immunk, rper, amboceptor, zwischenk, rper, substance, sensibilisatrice, copula, desmon, philocytase, fixateur, and, immunisin, the, word, antibody, has, formal, analogy, to, the, word, antitoxin, and, a, similar, concept, to, immunk, rper, immune, body, in, english, as, such, the, original, construction, of, the, word, contains, a, logical, flaw, the, antitoxin, is, something, directed, against, a, toxin, while, the, antibody, is, a, body, directed, against, something, the, study, of, antibodies, began, in, 1890, when, emil, von, behring, and, kitasato, shibasabur, described, antibody, activity, against, diphtheria, and, tetanus, toxins, von, behring, and, kitasato, put, forward, the, theory, of, humoral, immunity, proposing, that, a, mediator, in, serum, could, react, with, a, foreign, antigen, his, idea, prompted, paul, ehrlich, to, propose, the, side, chain, theory, for, antibody, and, antigen, interaction, in, 1897, when, he, hypothesized, that, receptors, described, as, side, chains, on, the, surface, of, cells, could, bind, specifically, to, toxins, in, a, lock, and, key, interaction, and, that, this, binding, reaction, is, the, trigger, for, the, production, of, antibodies, other, researchers, believed, that, antibodies, existed, freely, in, the, blood, and, in, 1904, almroth, wright, suggested, that, soluble, antibodies, coated, bacteria, to, label, them, for, phagocytosis, and, killing, a, process, that, he, named, opsoninization, in, the, 1920s, michael, heidelberger, and, oswald, avery, observed, that, antigens, could, be, precipitated, by, antibodies, and, went, on, to, show, that, antibodies, are, made, of, protein, the, biochemical, properties, of, antigen, antibody, binding, interactions, were, examined, in, more, detail, in, the, late, 1930s, by, john, marrack, the, next, major, advance, was, in, the, 1940s, when, linus, pauling, confirmed, the, lock, and, key, theory, proposed, by, ehrlich, by, showing, that, the, interactions, between, antibodies, and, antigens, depend, more, on, their, shape, than, their, chemical, composition, in, 1948, astrid, fagraeus, discovered, that, b, cells, in, the, form, of, plasma, cells, were, responsible, for, generating, antibodies, further, work, concentrated, on, characterizing, the, structures, of, the, antibody, proteins, a, major, advance, in, these, structural, studies, was, the, discovery, in, the, early, 1960s, by, gerald, edelman, and, joseph, gally, of, the, antibody, light, chain, and, their, realization, that, this, protein, is, the, same, as, the, bence, jones, protein, described, in, 1845, by, henry, bence, jones, edelman, went, on, to, discover, that, antibodies, are, composed, of, disulfide, bond, linked, heavy, and, light, chains, around, the, same, time, antibody, binding, fab, and, antibody, tail, fc, regions, of, igg, were, characterized, by, rodney, porter, together, these, scientists, deduced, the, structure, and, complete, amino, acid, sequence, of, igg, a, feat, for, which, they, were, jointly, awarded, the, 1972, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, the, fv, fragment, was, prepared, and, characterized, by, david, givol, while, most, of, these, early, studies, focused, on, igm, and, igg, other, immunoglobulin, isotypes, were, identified, in, the, 1960s, thomas, tomasi, discovered, secretory, antibody, iga, david, s, rowe, and, john, l, fahey, discovered, igd, and, kimishige, ishizaka, and, teruko, ishizaka, discovered, ige, and, showed, it, was, a, class, of, antibodies, involved, in, allergic, reactions, in, a, landmark, series, of, experiments, beginning, in, 1976, susumu, tonegawa, showed, that, genetic, material, can, rearrange, itself, to, form, the, vast, array, of, available, antibodies, detection, of, particular, antibodies, is, a, very, common, form, of, medical, diagnostics, and, applications, such, as, serology, depend, on, these, methods, for, example, in, biochemical, assays, for, disease, diagnosis, a, titer, of, antibodies, directed, against, epstein, barr, virus, or, lyme, disease, is, estimated, from, the, blood, if, those, antibodies, are, not, present, either, the, person, is, not, infected, or, the, infection, occurred, a, very, long, time, ago, and, the, b, cells, generating, these, specific, antibodies, have, naturally, decayed, in, clinical, immunology, levels, of, individual, classes, of, immunoglobulins, are, measured, by, nephelometry, or, turbidimetry, to, characterize, the, antibody, profile, of, patient, elevations, in, different, classes, of, immunoglobulins, are, sometimes, useful, in, determining, the, cause, of, liver, damage, in, patients, for, whom, the, diagnosis, is, unclear, for, example, elevated, iga, indicates, alcoholic, cirrhosis, elevated, igm, indicates, viral, hepatitis, and, primary, biliary, cirrhosis, while, igg, is, elevated, in, viral, hepatitis, autoimmune, hepatitis, and, cirrhosis, autoimmune, disorders, can, often, be, traced, to, antibodies, that, bind, the, body, s, own, epitopes, many, can, be, detected, through, blood, tests, antibodies, directed, against, red, blood, cell, surface, antigens, in, immune, mediated, hemolytic, anemia, are, detected, with, the, coombs, test, the, coombs, test, is, also, used, for, antibody, screening, in, blood, transfusion, preparation, and, also, for, antibody, screening, in, antenatal, women, practically, several, immunodiagnostic, methods, based, on, detection, of, complex, antigen, antibody, are, used, to, diagnose, infectious, diseases, for, example, elisa, immunofluorescence, western, blot, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, and, magnetic, immunoassay, antibodies, raised, against, human, chorionic, gonadotropin, are, used, in, over, the, counter, pregnancy, tests, new, dioxaborolane, chemistry, enables, radioactive, fluoride, 18, f, labeling, of, antibodies, which, allows, for, positron, emission, tomography, pet, imaging, of, cancer, targeted, monoclonal, antibody, therapy, is, employed, to, treat, diseases, such, as, rheumatoid, arthritis, multiple, sclerosis, psoriasis, and, many, forms, of, cancer, including, non, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, colorectal, cancer, head, and, neck, cancer, and, breast, cancer, some, immune, deficiencies, such, as, x, linked, agammaglobulinemia, and, hypogammaglobulinemia, result, in, partial, or, complete, lack, of, antibodies, these, diseases, are, often, treated, by, inducing, a, short, term, form, of, immunity, called, passive, immunity, passive, immunity, is, achieved, through, the, transfer, of, ready, made, antibodies, in, the, form, of, human, or, animal, serum, pooled, immunoglobulin, or, monoclonal, antibodies, into, the, affected, individual, rh, factor, also, known, as, rh, d, antigen, is, an, antigen, found, on, red, blood, cells, individuals, that, are, rh, positive, rh, have, this, antigen, on, their, red, blood, cells, and, individuals, that, are, rh, negative, rh, do, not, during, normal, childbirth, delivery, trauma, or, complications, during, pregnancy, blood, from, a, fetus, can, enter, the, mother, s, system, in, the, case, of, an, rh, incompatible, mother, and, child, consequential, blood, mixing, may, sensitize, an, rh, mother, to, the, rh, antigen, on, the, blood, cells, of, the, rh, child, putting, the, remainder, of, the, pregnancy, and, any, subsequent, pregnancies, at, risk, for, hemolytic, disease, of, the, newborn, rho, d, immune, globulin, antibodies, are, specific, for, human, rhd, antigen, anti, rhd, antibodies, are, administered, as, part, of, a, prenatal, treatment, regimen, to, prevent, sensitization, that, may, occur, when, a, rh, negative, mother, has, a, rh, positive, fetus, treatment, of, a, mother, with, anti, rhd, antibodies, prior, to, and, immediately, after, trauma, and, delivery, destroys, rh, antigen, in, the, mother, s, system, from, the, fetus, this, occurs, before, the, antigen, can, stimulate, maternal, b, cells, to, remember, rh, antigen, by, generating, memory, b, cells, therefore, her, humoral, immune, system, will, not, make, anti, rh, antibodies, and, will, not, attack, the, rh, antigens, of, the, current, or, subsequent, babies, rho, d, immune, globulin, treatment, prevents, sensitization, that, can, lead, to, rh, disease, but, does, not, prevent, or, treat, the, underlying, disease, itself, specific, antibodies, are, produced, by, injecting, an, antigen, into, a, mammal, such, as, a, mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or, horse, for, large, quantities, of, antibody, blood, isolated, from, these, animals, contains, polyclonal, antibodies, multiple, antibodies, that, bind, to, the, same, antigen, in, the, serum, which, can, now, be, called, antiserum, antigens, are, also, injected, into, chickens, for, generation, of, polyclonal, antibodies, in, egg, yolk, to, obtain, antibody, that, is, specific, for, a, single, epitope, of, an, antigen, antibody, secreting, lymphocytes, are, isolated, from, the, animal, and, immortalized, by, fusing, them, with, a, cancer, cell, line, the, fused, cells, are, called, hybridomas, and, will, continually, grow, and, secrete, antibody, in, culture, single, hybridoma, cells, are, isolated, by, dilution, cloning, to, generate, cell, clones, that, all, produce, the, same, antibody, these, antibodies, are, called, monoclonal, antibodies, polyclonal, and, monoclonal, antibodies, are, often, purified, using, protein, a, g, or, antigen, affinity, chromatography, in, research, purified, antibodies, are, used, in, many, applications, antibodies, for, research, applications, can, be, found, directly, from, antibody, suppliers, or, through, use, of, a, specialist, search, engine, research, antibodies, are, most, commonly, used, to, identify, and, locate, intracellular, and, extracellular, proteins, antibodies, are, used, in, flow, cytometry, to, differentiate, cell, types, by, the, proteins, they, express, different, types, of, cells, express, different, combinations, of, cluster, of, differentiation, molecules, on, their, surface, and, produce, different, intracellular, and, secretable, proteins, they, are, also, used, in, immunoprecipitation, to, separate, proteins, and, anything, bound, to, them, co, immunoprecipitation, from, other, molecules, in, a, cell, lysate, in, western, blot, analyses, to, identify, proteins, separated, by, electrophoresis, and, in, immunohistochemistry, or, immunofluorescence, to, examine, protein, expression, in, tissue, sections, or, to, locate, proteins, within, cells, with, the, assistance, of, a, microscope, proteins, can, also, be, detected, and, quantified, with, antibodies, using, elisa, and, elispot, techniques, antibodies, used, in, research, are, some, of, the, most, powerful, yet, most, problematic, reagents, with, a, tremendous, number, of, factors, that, must, be, controlled, in, any, experiment, including, cross, reactivity, or, the, antibody, recognizing, multiple, epitopes, and, affinity, which, can, vary, widely, depending, on, experimental, conditions, such, as, ph, solvent, state, of, tissue, etc, multiple, attempts, have, been, made, to, improve, both, the, way, that, researchers, validate, antibodies, and, ways, in, which, they, report, on, antibodies, researchers, using, antibodies, in, their, work, need, to, record, them, correctly, in, order, to, allow, their, research, to, be, reproducible, and, therefore, tested, and, qualified, by, other, researchers, less, than, half, of, research, antibodies, referenced, in, academic, papers, can, be, easily, identified, papers, published, in, f1000, in, 2014, and, 2015, provide, researchers, with, a, guide, for, reporting, research, antibody, use, the, rrid, paper, is, co, published, in, 4, journals, that, implemented, the, rrids, standard, for, research, resource, citation, which, draws, data, from, the, antibodyregistry, org, as, the, source, of, antibody, identifiers, see, also, group, at, force11, antibody, regions, can, be, used, to, further, biomedical, research, by, acting, as, a, guide, for, drugs, to, reach, their, target, several, application, involve, using, bacterial, plasmids, to, tag, plasmids, with, the, fc, region, of, the, antibody, such, as, pfuse, fc, plasmid, there, are, several, ways, to, obtain, antibodies, including, in, vivo, techniques, like, animal, immunization, and, various, in, vitro, approaches, such, as, the, phage, display, method, traditionally, most, antibodies, are, produced, by, hybridoma, cell, lines, through, immortalization, of, antibody, producing, cells, by, chemically, induced, fusion, with, myeloma, cells, in, some, cases, additional, fusions, with, other, lines, have, created, triomas, and, quadromas, the, manufacturing, process, should, be, appropriately, described, and, validated, validation, studies, should, at, least, include, the, importance, of, antibodies, in, health, care, and, the, biotechnology, industry, demands, knowledge, of, their, structures, at, high, resolution, this, information, is, used, for, protein, engineering, modifying, the, antigen, binding, affinity, and, identifying, an, epitope, of, a, given, antibody, x, ray, crystallography, is, one, commonly, used, method, for, determining, antibody, structures, however, crystallizing, an, antibody, is, often, laborious, and, time, consuming, computational, approaches, provide, a, cheaper, and, faster, alternative, to, crystallography, but, their, results, are, more, equivocal, since, they, do, not, produce, empirical, structures, online, web, servers, such, as, web, antibody, modeling, wam,

predict, successful, docking, of, antibodies, with, their, unique, antigen, however, describing, an, antibody, s, binding, site, using, only, one, single, static, structure, limits, the, understanding, and, characterization, of, the, antibody, s, function, and, properties, to, improve, antibody, structure, prediction, and, to, take, the, strongly, correlated, cdr, loop, and, interface, movements, into, account, antibody, paratopes, should, be, described, as, interconverting, states, in, solution, with, varying, probabilities, the, ability, to, describe, the, antibody, through, binding, affinity, to, the, antigen, is, supplemented, by, information, on, antibody, structure, and, amino, acid, sequences, for, the, purpose, of, patent, claims, several, methods, have, been, presented, for, computational, design, of, antibodies, based, on, the, structural, bioinformatics, studies, of, antibody, cdrs, there, are, a, variety, of, methods, used, to, sequence, an, antibody, including, edman, degradation, cdna, etc, albeit, one, of, the, most, common, modern, uses, for, peptide, protein, identification, is, liquid, chromatography, coupled, with, tandem, mass, spectrometry, lc, ms, ms, high, volume, antibody, sequencing, methods, require, computational, approaches, for, the, data, analysis, including, de, novo, sequencing, directly, from, tandem, mass, spectra, and, database, search, methods, that, use, existing, protein, sequence, databases, many, versions, of, shotgun, protein, sequencing, are, able, to, increase, the, coverage, by, utilizing, cid, hcd, etd, fragmentation, methods, and, other, techniques, and, they, have, achieved, substantial, progress, in, attempt, to, fully, sequence, proteins, especially, antibodies, other, methods, have, assumed, the, existence, of, similar, proteins, a, known, genome, sequence, or, combined, top, down, and, bottom, up, approaches, current, technologies, have, the, ability, to, assemble, protein, sequences, with, high, accuracy, by, integrating, de, novo, sequencing, peptides, intensity, and, positional, confidence, scores, from, database, and, homology, searches, antibody, mimetics,
