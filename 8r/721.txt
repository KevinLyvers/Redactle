pangolins, sometimes, known, as, scaly, anteaters, are, mammals, of, the, order, pholidota, f, l, d, o, t, the, one, extant, family, the, manidae, has, three, genera, manis, phataginus, and, smutsia, manis, comprises, four, species, found, in, asia, while, phataginus, and, smutsia, include, two, species, each, all, found, in, sub, saharan, africa, these, species, range, in, size, from, 30, to, 100, cm, 12, to, 39, in, a, number, of, extinct, pangolin, species, are, also, known, in, september, 2023, nine, species, were, reported, pangolins, have, large, protective, keratin, scales, similar, in, material, to, fingernails, and, toenails, covering, their, skin, they, are, the, only, known, mammals, with, this, feature, they, live, in, hollow, trees, or, burrows, depending, on, the, species, pangolins, are, nocturnal, and, their, diet, consists, of, mainly, ants, and, termites, which, they, capture, using, their, long, tongues, they, tend, to, be, solitary, animals, meeting, only, to, mate, and, produce, a, litter, of, one, to, three, offspring, which, they, raise, for, about, two, years, pangolins, superficially, resemble, armadillos, though, the, two, are, not, closely, related, they, have, merely, undergone, convergent, evolution, pangolins, are, threatened, by, poaching, for, their, meat, and, scales, which, are, used, in, traditional, medicine, and, heavy, deforestation, of, their, natural, habitats, and, are, the, most, trafficked, mammals, in, the, world, as, of, january, 2020, there, are, eight, species, of, pangolin, whose, conservation, status, is, listed, in, the, threatened, tier, three, manis, culionensis, m, pentadactyla, and, m, javanica, are, critically, endangered, three, phataginus, tricuspis, manis, crassicaudata, and, smutsia, gigantea, are, endangered, and, two, phataginus, tetradactyla, and, smutsia, temminckii, are, vulnerable, on, the, red, list, of, threatened, species, of, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, the, name, of, order, pholidota, comes, from, ancient, greek, clad, in, scales, from, phol, s, scale, the, name, pangolin, comes, from, the, malay, word, pengguling, meaning, one, who, rolls, up, from, guling, or, giling, to, roll, it, was, used, for, the, sunda, pangolin, manis, javanica, however, the, modern, name, is, tenggiling, in, javanese, it, is, terenggiling, and, in, the, philippine, languages, it, is, goling, tanggiling, or, balintong, with, the, same, meaning, in, ancient, india, according, to, aelian, it, was, known, as, the, phatt, ges, the, physical, appearance, of, a, pangolin, is, marked, by, large, hardened, overlapping, plate, like, scales, which, are, soft, on, newborn, pangolins, but, harden, as, the, animal, matures, they, are, made, of, keratin, the, same, material, from, which, human, fingernails, and, tetrapod, claws, are, made, and, are, structurally, and, compositionally, very, different, from, the, scales, of, reptiles, the, pangolin, s, scaled, body, is, comparable, in, appearance, to, a, pine, cone, it, can, curl, up, into, a, ball, when, threatened, with, its, overlapping, scales, acting, as, armor, while, it, protects, its, face, by, tucking, it, under, its, tail, the, scales, are, sharp, providing, extra, defense, from, predators, pangolins, can, emit, a, noxious, smelling, chemical, from, glands, near, the, anus, similar, to, the, spray, of, a, skunk, they, have, short, legs, with, sharp, claws, which, they, use, for, burrowing, into, ant, and, termite, mounds, and, for, climbing, the, tongues, of, pangolins, are, extremely, long, and, like, those, of, the, giant, anteater, and, the, tube, lipped, nectar, bat, the, root, of, the, tongue, is, not, attached, to, the, hyoid, bone, but, is, in, the, thorax, between, the, sternum, and, the, trachea, large, pangolins, can, extend, their, tongues, as, much, as, 40, cm, 16, in, with, a, diameter, of, only, about, 0, 5, cm, 1, 5, in, most, pangolins, are, nocturnal, animals, which, use, their, well, developed, sense, of, smell, to, find, insects, the, long, tailed, pangolin, is, also, active, by, day, while, other, species, of, pangolins, spend, most, of, the, daytime, sleeping, curled, up, into, a, ball, volvation, arboreal, pangolins, live, in, hollow, trees, whereas, the, ground, dwelling, species, dig, tunnels, to, a, depth, of, 3, 5, m, 11, ft, some, pangolins, walk, with, their, front, claws, bent, under, the, foot, pad, although, they, use, the, entire, foot, pad, on, their, rear, limbs, furthermore, some, exhibit, a, bipedal, stance, for, some, behaviour, and, may, walk, a, few, steps, bipedally, pangolins, are, also, good, swimmers, pangolins, are, insectivorous, most, of, their, diet, consists, of, various, species, of, ants, and, termites, and, may, be, supplemented, by, other, insects, especially, larvae, they, are, somewhat, particular, and, tend, to, consume, only, one, or, two, species, of, insects, even, when, many, species, are, available, to, them, a, pangolin, can, consume, 140, to, 200, g, 5, to, 7, oz, of, insects, per, day, pangolins, are, an, important, regulator, of, termite, populations, in, their, natural, habitats, pangolins, have, very, poor, vision, they, also, lack, teeth, they, rely, heavily, on, smell, and, hearing, and, they, have, other, physical, characteristics, to, help, them, eat, ants, and, termites, their, skeletal, structure, is, sturdy, and, they, have, strong, front, legs, that, are, used, for, tearing, into, termite, mounds, they, use, their, powerful, front, claws, to, dig, into, trees, soil, and, vegetation, to, find, prey, then, proceed, to, use, their, long, tongues, to, probe, inside, the, insect, tunnels, and, to, retrieve, their, prey, the, structure, of, their, tongue, and, stomach, is, key, to, aiding, pangolins, in, obtaining, and, digesting, insects, their, saliva, is, sticky, causing, ants, and, termites, to, stick, to, their, long, tongues, when, they, are, hunting, through, insect, tunnels, without, teeth, pangolins, also, lack, the, ability, to, chew, but, while, foraging, they, ingest, small, stones, gastroliths, which, accumulate, in, their, stomachs, to, help, to, grind, up, ants, this, part, of, their, stomach, is, called, the, gizzard, and, it, is, also, covered, in, keratinous, spines, these, spines, further, aid, in, the, grinding, up, and, digestion, of, the, pangolin, s, prey, some, species, such, as, the, tree, pangolin, use, their, strong, prehensile, tails, to, hang, from, tree, branches, and, strip, away, bark, from, the, trunk, exposing, insect, nests, inside, pangolins, are, solitary, and, meet, only, to, mate, with, mating, typically, taking, place, at, night, after, the, male, and, female, pangolin, meet, near, a, watering, hole, males, are, larger, than, females, weighing, up, to, 40, more, while, the, mating, season, is, not, defined, they, typically, mate, once, each, year, usually, during, the, summer, or, autumn, rather, than, the, males, seeking, out, the, females, males, mark, their, location, with, urine, or, feces, and, the, females, find, them, if, competition, over, a, female, occurs, the, males, use, their, tails, as, clubs, to, fight, for, the, opportunity, to, mate, with, her, gestation, periods, differ, by, species, ranging, from, roughly, 70, to, 140, days, african, pangolin, females, usually, give, birth, to, a, single, offspring, at, a, time, but, the, asiatic, species, may, give, birth, to, from, one, to, three, weight, at, birth, is, 80, to, 450, g, 2, 3, 4, to, 15, 3, 4, oz, and, the, average, length, is, 150, mm, 6, in, at, the, time, of, birth, the, scales, are, soft, and, white, after, several, days, they, harden, and, darken, to, resemble, those, of, an, adult, pangolin, during, the, vulnerable, stage, the, mother, stays, with, her, offspring, in, the, burrow, nursing, it, and, wraps, her, body, around, it, if, she, senses, danger, the, young, cling, to, the, mother, s, tail, as, she, moves, about, although, in, burrowing, species, they, remain, in, the, burrow, for, the, first, 2, 4, weeks, of, life, at, one, month, they, first, leave, the, burrow, riding, on, the, mother, s, back, weaning, takes, place, around, three, months, of, age, when, the, young, begin, to, eat, insects, in, addition, to, nursing, at, two, years, of, age, the, offspring, are, sexually, mature, and, are, abandoned, by, the, mother, the, order, pholidota, was, long, considered, to, be, the, sister, taxon, to, xenarthra, neotropical, anteaters, sloths, and, armadillos, but, recent, genetic, evidence, indicates, their, closest, living, relatives, are, the, carnivorans, with, which, they, form, a, clade, the, ferae, palaeanodonts, are, even, closer, relatives, to, pangolins, being, classified, with, pangolins, in, the, clade, pholidotamorpha, the, split, between, carnivorans, and, pangolins, is, estimated, to, have, occurred, 79, 47, ma, million, years, ago, the, first, dichotomy, in, the, phylogeny, of, extant, manidae, separates, asian, pangolins, manis, from, african, pangolins, smutsia, and, phataginus, within, the, former, manis, pentadactyla, is, the, sister, group, to, a, clade, comprising, m, crassicaudata, and, m, javanica, within, the, latter, a, split, separates, the, large, terrestrial, african, pangolins, of, the, genus, smutsia, from, the, small, arboreal, african, pangolins, of, the, genus, phataginus, asian, and, african, pangolins, are, thought, to, have, diverged, about, 41, 37, ma, ago, moreover, the, basal, position, of, manis, within, pholidota, suggests, the, group, originated, in, eurasia, consistent, with, their, laurasiatherian, phylogeny, pangolins, are, in, high, demand, in, southern, china, and, vietnam, because, their, scales, are, believed, to, have, medicinal, properties, in, traditional, chinese, and, vietnamese, medicine, their, meat, is, also, considered, a, delicacy, 100, 000, are, estimated, to, be, trafficked, a, year, to, china, and, vietnam, amounting, to, over, one, million, over, the, past, decade, this, makes, them, the, most, trafficked, animal, in, the, world, this, coupled, with, deforestation, has, led, to, a, large, decrease, in, the, numbers, of, pangolins, some, species, such, as, manis, pentadactyla, have, become, commercially, extinct, in, certain, ranges, as, a, result, of, overhunting, in, november, 2010, pangolins, were, added, to, the, zoological, society, of, london, s, list, of, evolutionarily, distinct, and, endangered, mammals, all, eight, species, of, pangolin, are, assessed, as, threatened, by, the, iucn, while, three, are, classified, as, critically, endangered, all, pangolin, species, are, currently, listed, under, appendix, i, of, cites, which, prohibits, international, trade, except, when, the, product, is, intended, for, non, commercial, purposes, and, a, permit, has, been, granted, china, had, been, the, main, destination, country, for, pangolins, until, 2018, where, it, was, surpassed, by, vietnam, in, 2019, vietnam, was, reported, to, have, seized, the, largest, volumes, of, pangolin, scales, surpassing, nigeria, that, year, pangolins, are, also, hunted, and, eaten, in, ghana, and, are, one, of, the, more, popular, types, of, bushmeat, while, local, healers, use, the, pangolin, as, a, source, of, traditional, medicine, though, pangolins, are, protected, by, an, international, ban, on, their, trade, populations, have, suffered, from, illegal, trafficking, due, to, beliefs, in, east, asia, that, their, ground, up, scales, can, stimulate, lactation, or, cure, cancer, or, asthma, in, the, past, decade, numerous, seizures, of, illegally, trafficked, pangolin, and, pangolin, meat, have, taken, place, in, asia, in, one, such, incident, in, april, 2013, 10, 000, kg, 22, 000, pounds, of, pangolin, meat, were, seized, from, a, chinese, vessel, that, ran, aground, in, the, philippines, in, another, case, in, august, 2016, an, indonesian, man, was, arrested, after, police, raided, his, home, and, found, over, 650, pangolins, in, freezers, on, his, property, the, same, threat, is, reported, in, nigeria, where, the, animal, is, on, the, verge, of, extinction, due, to, overexploitation, the, overexploitation, comes, from, hunting, pangolins, for, game, meat, and, the, reduction, of, their, forest, habitats, due, to, deforestation, caused, by, timber, harvesting, the, pangolin, are, hunted, as, game, meat, for, both, medicinal, purposes, and, food, consumption, the, nucleic, acid, sequence, of, a, specific, receptor, binding, domain, of, the, spike, protein, belonging, to, coronaviruses, taken, from, pangolins, was, found, to, be, a, 99, match, with, sars, coronavirus, 2, sars, cov, 2, the, virus, which, causes, covid, 19, and, is, responsible, for, the, covid, 19, pandemic, researchers, in, guangzhou, china, hypothesized, that, sars, cov, 2, had, originated, in, bats, and, prior, to, infecting, humans, was, circulating, among, pangolins, the, illicit, chinese, trade, of, pangolins, for, use, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, was, suggested, as, a, vector, for, human, transmission, however, whole, genome, comparison, found, that, the, pangolin, and, human, coronaviruses, share, only, up, to, 92, of, their, rna, ecologists, worried, that, the, early, speculation, about, pangolins, being, the, source, may, have, led, to, mass, slaughters, endangering, them, further, which, was, similar, to, what, happened, to, asian, palm, civets, during, the, sars, outbreak, it, was, later, proved, that, the, testing, which, suggested, that, pangolins, were, a, potential, host, for, the, virus, was, flawed, when, genetic, analysis, showed, that, the, spike, protein, and, its, binding, to, receptors, in, pangolins, had, minimal, effect, from, the, virus, and, therefore, were, not, likely, mechanisms, for, covid, 19, infections, in, humans, in, 2020, two, novel, rna, viruses, distantly, related, to, pestiviruses, and, coltiviruses, have, been, detected, in, the, genomes, of, dead, manis, javanica, and, manis, pentadactyla, to, refer, to, both, sampling, site, and, hosts, they, were, named, dongyang, pangolin, virus, dypv, and, lishui, pangolin, virus, lspv, the, dypv, pestivirus, was, also, identified, in, amblyomma, javanense, nymph, ticks, from, a, diseased, pangolin, pangolin, scales, and, flesh, are, used, as, ingredients, for, various, traditional, chinese, medicine, preparations, while, no, scientific, evidence, exists, for, the, efficacy, of, those, practices, and, they, have, no, logical, mechanism, of, action, their, popularity, still, drives, the, black, market, for, animal, body, parts, despite, concerns, about, toxicity, transmission, of, diseases, from, animals, to, humans, and, species, extermination, the, ongoing, demand, for, parts, as, ingredients, continues, to, fuel, pangolin, poaching, hunting, and, trading, the, first, record, of, pangolin, scales, occurs, in, ben, cao, jinji, zhu, variorum, of, shennong, s, classic, of, materia, medica, 500, ce, which, recommends, pangolin, scales, for, protection, against, ant, bites, burning, the, scales, as, a, cure, for, people, crying, hysterically, during, the, night, during, the, tang, dynasty, a, recipe, for, expelling, evil, spirits, with, a, formulation, of, scales, herbs, and, minerals, appeared, in, 682, and, in, 752, ce, the, idea, that, pangolin, scales, could, also, stimulate, milk, secretion, in, lactating, women, one, of, the, main, uses, today, was, recommended, in, the, wai, tai, mi, yao, arcane, essentials, from, the, imperial, library, in, the, song, dynasty, the, notion, of, penetrating, and, clearing, blockages, was, emphasized, in, the, taiping, sheng, hui, fan, formulas, from, benevolent, sages, compiled, during, the, era, of, peace, and, tranquility, compiled, by, wang, huaiyin, in, 992, in, the, 21st, century, the, main, uses, of, pangolin, scales, are, quackery, practices, based, on, unproven, claims, the, scales, dissolve, blood, clots, promote, blood, circulation, or, help, lactating, women, secrete, milk, the, supposed, health, effects, of, pangolin, meat, and, scales, claimed, by, folk, medicine, practitioners, and, quacks, are, based, on, their, consumption, of, ants, long, tongues, and, protective, scales, the, official, pharmacopoeia, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, included, chinese, pangolin, scales, as, an, ingredient, in, tcm, formulations, pangolins, were, removed, from, the, pharmacopoeia, starting, from, the, first, half, of, 2020, although, pangolin, scales, have, been, removed, from, the, list, of, raw, ingredients, the, scales, are, still, listed, as, a, key, ingredient, in, various, medicines, pangolin, parts, are, also, used, for, medicinal, purposes, in, other, asian, countries, such, as, india, nepal, and, pakistan, in, some, parts, of, india, and, nepal, locals, believe, that, wearing, the, scales, of, a, pangolin, can, help, prevent, pneumonia, pangolin, scales, have, also, been, used, for, medicinal, purposes, in, malaysia, indonesia, and, northern, myanmar, indigenous, people, in, southern, palawan, philippines, have, held, the, belief, that, elders, could, avoid, prostate, illnesses, by, wearing, belts, made, with, the, scales, as, a, result, of, increasing, threats, to, pangolins, mainly, in, the, form, of, illegal, international, trade, in, pangolin, skin, scales, and, meat, these, species, have, received, increasing, conservation, attention, in, recent, years, as, of, january, 2020, the, iucn, considered, all, eight, species, of, pangolin, on, its, red, list, of, threatened, species, as, threatened, the, iucn, ssc, pangolin, specialist, group, launched, a, global, action, plan, to, conserve, pangolins, dubbed, scaling, up, pangolin, conservation, in, july, 2014, this, action, plan, aims, to, improve, all, aspects, of, pangolin, conservation, with, an, added, emphasis, on, combating, poaching, and, trafficking, of, the, animal, while, educating, communities, on, its, importance, another, suggested, approach, to, fighting, pangolin, and, general, wildlife, trafficking, consists, in, following, the, money, rather, than, the, animal, which, aims, to, disrupt, smugglers, profits, by, interrupting, money, flows, financial, intelligence, gathering, could, thus, become, a, key, tool, in, protecting, these, animals, although, this, opportunity, is, often, overlooked, in, 2018, a, chinese, ngo, launched, the, counting, pangolins, movement, calling, for, joint, efforts, to, save, the, mammals, from, trafficking, wildlife, conservation, group, traffic, has, identified, 159, smuggling, routes, used, by, pangolin, traffickers, and, aims, to, shut, these, down, many, attempts, have, been, made, to, breed, pangolins, in, captivity, but, due, to, their, reliance, on, wide, ranging, habitats, and, very, particular, diets, these, attempts, are, often, unsuccessful, pangolins, have, significantly, decreased, immune, responses, due, to, a, genetic, dysfunction, making, them, extremely, fragile, they, are, susceptible, to, diseases, such, as, pneumonia, and, the, development, of, ulcers, in, captivity, complications, that, can, lead, to, an, early, death, in, addition, pangolins, rescued, from, illegal, trade, often, have, a, higher, chance, of, being, infected, with, parasites, such, as, intestinal, worms, further, lessening, their, chance, for, rehabilitation, and, reintroduction, to, the, wild, the, idea, of, farming, pangolins, to, reduce, the, number, being, illegally, trafficked, is, being, explored, with, little, success, the, third, saturday, in, february, is, promoted, as, world, pangolin, day, by, the, conservation, npo, annamiticus, world, pangolin, day, has, been, noted, for, its, effectiveness, in, generating, awareness, about, pangolins, in, 2017, jackie, chan, made, a, public, service, announcement, called, wildaid, jackie, chan, pangolins, kung, fu, pangolin, in, december, 2020, a, study, found, that, it, is, not, too, late, to, establish, conservation, efforts, for, philippine, pangolins, manis, culionensis, a, species, that, is, only, found, on, the, island, province, of, palawan, taiwan, is, one, of, the, few, conservation, grounds, for, pangolins, in, the, world, after, the, country, enacted, the, 1989, wildlife, conservation, act, the, introduction, of, wildlife, rehabilitation, centers, in, places, like, luanshan, yanping, township, in, taitung, and, xiulin, townships, in, hualien, became, important, communities, for, protecting, pangolins, and, their, habitats, and, has, greatly, improved, the, survival, of, pangolins, these, centers, work, with, local, aboriginal, tribes, and, forest, police, in, the, national, police, agency, to, prevent, poaching, trafficking, and, smuggling, of, pangolins, especially, to, black, markets, in, china, these, centers, have, also, helped, to, reveal, the, causes, of, death, and, injury, among, taiwan, s, pangolin, population, today, taiwan, has, the, highest, population, density, of, pangolins, in, the, world
