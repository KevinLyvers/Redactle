ascomycota, is, a, phylum, of, the, kingdom, fungi, that, together, with, the, basidiomycota, forms, the, subkingdom, dikarya, its, members, are, commonly, known, as, the, sac, fungi, or, ascomycetes, it, is, the, largest, phylum, of, fungi, with, over, 64, 000, species, the, defining, feature, of, this, fungal, group, is, the, ascus, from, ancient, greek, ask, s, sac, wineskin, a, microscopic, sexual, structure, in, which, nonmotile, spores, called, ascospores, are, formed, however, some, species, of, ascomycota, are, asexual, and, thus, do, not, form, asci, or, ascospores, familiar, examples, of, sac, fungi, include, morels, truffles, brewers, and, bakers, yeast, dead, man, s, fingers, and, cup, fungi, the, fungal, symbionts, in, the, majority, of, lichens, loosely, termed, ascolichens, such, as, cladonia, belong, to, the, ascomycota, ascomycota, is, a, monophyletic, group, containing, all, of, the, descendants, of, a, common, ancestor, previously, placed, in, the, basidiomycota, along, with, asexual, species, from, other, fungal, taxa, asexual, or, anamorphic, ascomycetes, are, now, identified, and, classified, based, on, morphological, or, physiological, similarities, to, ascus, bearing, taxa, and, by, phylogenetic, analyses, of, dna, sequences, ascomycetes, are, of, particular, use, to, humans, as, sources, of, medicinally, important, compounds, such, as, antibiotics, as, well, as, for, fermenting, bread, alcoholic, beverages, and, cheese, examples, of, ascomycetes, include, penicillium, species, on, cheeses, and, those, producing, antibiotics, for, treating, bacterial, infectious, diseases, many, ascomycetes, are, pathogens, both, of, animals, including, humans, and, of, plants, examples, of, ascomycetes, that, can, cause, infections, in, humans, include, candida, albicans, aspergillus, niger, and, several, tens, of, species, that, cause, skin, infections, the, many, plant, pathogenic, ascomycetes, include, apple, scab, rice, blast, the, ergot, fungi, black, knot, and, the, powdery, mildews, the, members, of, the, genus, cordyceps, are, entomopathogenic, fungi, meaning, that, they, parasitise, and, kill, insects, other, entomopathogenic, ascomycetes, have, been, used, successfully, in, biological, pest, control, such, as, beauveria, several, species, of, ascomycetes, are, biological, model, organisms, in, laboratory, research, most, famously, neurospora, crassa, several, species, of, yeasts, and, aspergillus, species, are, used, in, many, genetics, and, cell, biology, studies, ascomycetes, are, spore, shooters, they, are, fungi, which, produce, microscopic, spores, inside, special, elongated, cells, or, sacs, known, as, asci, which, give, the, group, its, name, asexual, reproduction, is, the, dominant, form, of, propagation, in, the, ascomycota, and, is, responsible, for, the, rapid, spread, of, these, fungi, into, new, areas, asexual, reproduction, of, ascomycetes, is, very, diverse, from, both, structural, and, functional, points, of, view, the, most, important, and, general, is, production, of, conidia, but, chlamydospores, are, also, frequently, produced, furthermore, ascomycota, also, reproduce, asexually, through, budding, asexual, reproduction, may, occur, through, vegetative, reproductive, spores, the, conidia, the, asexual, non, motile, haploid, spores, of, a, fungus, which, are, named, after, the, greek, word, for, dust, conia, are, hence, also, known, as, conidiospores, the, conidiospores, commonly, contain, one, nucleus, and, are, products, of, mitotic, cell, divisions, and, thus, are, sometimes, called, mitospores, which, are, genetically, identical, to, the, mycelium, from, which, they, originate, they, are, typically, formed, at, the, ends, of, specialized, hyphae, the, conidiophores, depending, on, the, species, they, may, be, dispersed, by, wind, or, water, or, by, animals, conidiophores, may, simply, branch, off, from, the, mycelia, or, they, may, be, formed, in, fruiting, bodies, the, hypha, that, creates, the, sporing, conidiating, tip, can, be, very, similar, to, the, normal, hyphal, tip, or, it, can, be, differentiated, the, most, common, differentiation, is, the, formation, of, a, bottle, shaped, cell, called, a, phialide, from, which, the, spores, are, produced, not, all, of, these, asexual, structures, are, a, single, hypha, in, some, groups, the, conidiophores, the, structures, that, bear, the, conidia, are, aggregated, to, form, a, thick, structure, e, g, in, the, order, moniliales, all, of, them, are, single, hyphae, with, the, exception, of, the, aggregations, termed, as, coremia, or, synnema, these, produce, structures, rather, like, corn, stokes, with, many, conidia, being, produced, in, a, mass, from, the, aggregated, conidiophores, the, diverse, conidia, and, conidiophores, sometimes, develop, in, asexual, sporocarps, with, different, characteristics, e, g, acervulus, pycnidium, sporodochium, some, species, of, ascomycetes, form, their, structures, within, plant, tissue, either, as, parasite, or, saprophytes, these, fungi, have, evolved, more, complex, asexual, sporing, structures, probably, influenced, by, the, cultural, conditions, of, plant, tissue, as, a, substrate, these, structures, are, called, the, sporodochium, this, is, a, cushion, of, conidiophores, created, from, a, pseudoparenchymatous, stroma, in, plant, tissue, the, pycnidium, is, a, globose, to, flask, shaped, parenchymatous, structure, lined, on, its, inner, wall, with, conidiophores, the, acervulus, is, a, flat, saucer, shaped, bed, of, conidiophores, produced, under, a, plant, cuticle, which, eventually, erupt, through, the, cuticle, for, dispersal, asexual, reproduction, process, in, ascomycetes, also, involves, the, budding, which, we, clearly, observe, in, yeast, this, is, termed, a, blastic, process, it, involves, the, blowing, out, or, blebbing, of, the, hyphal, tip, wall, the, blastic, process, can, involve, all, wall, layers, or, there, can, be, a, new, cell, wall, synthesized, which, is, extruded, from, within, the, old, wall, the, initial, events, of, budding, can, be, seen, as, the, development, of, a, ring, of, chitin, around, the, point, where, the, bud, is, about, to, appear, this, reinforces, and, stabilizes, the, cell, wall, enzymatic, activity, and, turgor, pressure, act, to, weaken, and, extrude, the, cell, wall, new, cell, wall, material, is, incorporated, during, this, phase, cell, contents, are, forced, into, the, progeny, cell, and, as, the, final, phase, of, mitosis, ends, a, cell, plate, the, point, at, which, a, new, cell, wall, will, grow, inwards, from, forms, there, are, three, subphyla, that, are, described, and, accepted, several, outdated, taxon, names, based, on, morphological, features, are, still, occasionally, used, for, species, of, the, ascomycota, these, include, the, following, sexual, teleomorphic, groups, defined, by, the, structures, of, their, sexual, fruiting, bodies, the, discomycetes, which, included, all, species, forming, apothecia, the, pyrenomycetes, which, included, all, sac, fungi, that, formed, perithecia, or, pseudothecia, or, any, structure, resembling, these, morphological, structures, and, the, plectomycetes, which, included, those, species, that, form, cleistothecia, hemiascomycetes, included, the, yeasts, and, yeast, like, fungi, that, have, now, been, placed, into, the, saccharomycotina, or, taphrinomycotina, while, the, euascomycetes, included, the, remaining, species, of, the, ascomycota, which, are, now, in, the, pezizomycotina, and, the, neolecta, which, are, in, the, taphrinomycotina, some, ascomycetes, do, not, reproduce, sexually, or, are, not, known, to, produce, asci, and, are, therefore, anamorphic, species, those, anamorphs, that, produce, conidia, mitospores, were, previously, described, as, mitosporic, ascomycota, some, taxonomists, placed, this, group, into, a, separate, artificial, phylum, the, deuteromycota, or, fungi, imperfecti, where, recent, molecular, analyses, have, identified, close, relationships, with, ascus, bearing, taxa, anamorphic, species, have, been, grouped, into, the, ascomycota, despite, the, absence, of, the, defining, ascus, sexual, and, asexual, isolates, of, the, same, species, commonly, carry, different, binomial, species, names, as, for, example, aspergillus, nidulans, and, emericella, nidulans, for, asexual, and, sexual, isolates, respectively, of, the, same, species, species, of, the, deuteromycota, were, classified, as, coelomycetes, if, they, produced, their, conidia, in, minute, flask, or, saucer, shaped, conidiomata, known, technically, as, pycnidia, and, acervuli, the, hyphomycetes, were, those, species, where, the, conidiophores, i, e, the, hyphal, structures, that, carry, conidia, forming, cells, at, the, end, are, free, or, loosely, organized, they, are, mostly, isolated, but, sometimes, also, appear, as, bundles, of, cells, aligned, in, parallel, described, as, synnematal, or, as, cushion, shaped, masses, described, as, sporodochial, most, species, grow, as, filamentous, microscopic, structures, called, hyphae, or, as, budding, single, cells, yeasts, many, interconnected, hyphae, form, a, thallus, usually, referred, to, as, the, mycelium, which, when, visible, to, the, naked, eye, macroscopic, is, commonly, called, mold, during, sexual, reproduction, many, ascomycota, typically, produce, large, numbers, of, asci, the, ascus, is, often, contained, in, a, multicellular, occasionally, readily, visible, fruiting, structure, the, ascocarp, also, called, an, ascoma, ascocarps, come, in, a, very, large, variety, of, shapes, cup, shaped, club, shaped, potato, like, spongy, seed, like, oozing, and, pimple, like, coral, like, nit, like, golf, ball, shaped, perforated, tennis, ball, like, cushion, shaped, plated, and, feathered, in, miniature, laboulbeniales, microscopic, classic, greek, shield, shaped, stalked, or, sessile, they, can, appear, solitary, or, clustered, their, texture, can, likewise, be, very, variable, including, fleshy, like, charcoal, carbonaceous, leathery, rubbery, gelatinous, slimy, powdery, or, cob, web, like, ascocarps, come, in, multiple, colors, such, as, red, orange, yellow, brown, black, or, more, rarely, green, or, blue, some, ascomyceous, fungi, such, as, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, grow, as, single, celled, yeasts, which, during, sexual, reproduction, develop, into, an, ascus, and, do, not, form, fruiting, bodies, in, lichenized, species, the, thallus, of, the, fungus, defines, the, shape, of, the, symbiotic, colony, some, dimorphic, species, such, as, candida, albicans, can, switch, between, growth, as, single, cells, and, as, filamentous, multicellular, hyphae, other, species, are, pleomorphic, exhibiting, asexual, anamorphic, as, well, as, a, sexual, teleomorphic, growth, forms, except, for, lichens, the, non, reproductive, vegetative, mycelium, of, most, ascomycetes, is, usually, inconspicuous, because, it, is, commonly, embedded, in, the, substrate, such, as, soil, or, grows, on, or, inside, a, living, host, and, only, the, ascoma, may, be, seen, when, fruiting, pigmentation, such, as, melanin, in, hyphal, walls, along, with, prolific, growth, on, surfaces, can, result, in, visible, mold, colonies, examples, include, cladosporium, species, which, form, black, spots, on, bathroom, caulking, and, other, moist, areas, many, ascomycetes, cause, food, spoilage, and, therefore, the, pellicles, or, moldy, layers, that, develop, on, jams, juices, and, other, foods, are, the, mycelia, of, these, species, or, occasionally, mucoromycotina, and, almost, never, basidiomycota, sooty, molds, that, develop, on, plants, especially, in, the, tropics, are, the, thalli, of, many, species, large, masses, of, yeast, cells, asci, or, ascus, like, cells, or, conidia, can, also, form, macroscopic, structures, for, example, pneumocystis, species, can, colonize, lung, cavities, visible, in, x, rays, causing, a, form, of, pneumonia, asci, of, ascosphaera, fill, honey, bee, larvae, and, pupae, causing, mummification, with, a, chalk, like, appearance, hence, the, name, chalkbrood, yeasts, for, small, colonies, in, vitro, and, in, vivo, and, excessive, growth, of, candida, species, in, the, mouth, or, vagina, causes, thrush, a, form, of, candidiasis, the, cell, walls, of, the, ascomycetes, almost, always, contain, chitin, and, glucans, and, divisions, within, the, hyphae, called, septa, are, the, internal, boundaries, of, individual, cells, or, compartments, the, cell, wall, and, septa, give, stability, and, rigidity, to, the, hyphae, and, may, prevent, loss, of, cytoplasm, in, case, of, local, damage, to, cell, wall, and, cell, membrane, the, septa, commonly, have, a, small, opening, in, the, center, which, functions, as, a, cytoplasmic, connection, between, adjacent, cells, also, sometimes, allowing, cell, to, cell, movement, of, nuclei, within, a, hypha, vegetative, hyphae, of, most, ascomycetes, contain, only, one, nucleus, per, cell, uninucleate, hyphae, but, multinucleate, cells, especially, in, the, apical, regions, of, growing, hyphae, can, also, be, present, in, common, with, other, fungal, phyla, the, ascomycota, are, heterotrophic, organisms, that, require, organic, compounds, as, energy, sources, these, are, obtained, by, feeding, on, a, variety, of, organic, substrates, including, dead, matter, foodstuffs, or, as, symbionts, in, or, on, other, living, organisms, to, obtain, these, nutrients, from, their, surroundings, ascomycetous, fungi, secrete, powerful, digestive, enzymes, that, break, down, organic, substances, into, smaller, molecules, which, are, then, taken, up, into, the, cell, many, species, live, on, dead, plant, material, such, as, leaves, twigs, or, logs, several, species, colonize, plants, animals, or, other, fungi, as, parasites, or, mutualistic, symbionts, and, derive, all, their, metabolic, energy, in, form, of, nutrients, from, the, tissues, of, their, hosts, owing, to, their, long, evolutionary, history, the, ascomycota, have, evolved, the, capacity, to, break, down, almost, every, organic, substance, unlike, most, organisms, they, are, able, to, use, their, own, enzymes, to, digest, plant, biopolymers, such, as, cellulose, or, lignin, collagen, an, abundant, structural, protein, in, animals, and, keratin, a, protein, that, forms, hair, and, nails, can, also, serve, as, food, sources, unusual, examples, include, aureobasidium, pullulans, which, feeds, on, wall, paint, and, the, kerosene, fungus, amorphotheca, resinae, which, feeds, on, aircraft, fuel, causing, occasional, problems, for, the, airline, industry, and, may, sometimes, block, fuel, pipes, other, species, can, resist, high, osmotic, stress, and, grow, for, example, on, salted, fish, and, a, few, ascomycetes, are, aquatic, the, ascomycota, is, characterized, by, a, high, degree, of, specialization, for, instance, certain, species, of, laboulbeniales, attack, only, one, particular, leg, of, one, particular, insect, species, many, ascomycota, engage, in, symbiotic, relationships, such, as, in, lichens, symbiotic, associations, with, green, algae, or, cyanobacteria, in, which, the, fungal, symbiont, directly, obtains, products, of, photosynthesis, in, common, with, many, basidiomycetes, and, glomeromycota, some, ascomycetes, form, symbioses, with, plants, by, colonizing, the, roots, to, form, mycorrhizal, associations, the, ascomycota, also, represents, several, carnivorous, fungi, which, have, developed, hyphal, traps, to, capture, small, protists, such, as, amoebae, as, well, as, roundworms, nematoda, rotifers, tardigrades, and, small, arthropods, such, as, springtails, collembola, the, ascomycota, are, represented, in, all, land, ecosystems, worldwide, occurring, on, all, continents, including, antarctica, spores, and, hyphal, fragments, are, dispersed, through, the, atmosphere, and, freshwater, environments, as, well, as, ocean, beaches, and, tidal, zones, the, distribution, of, species, is, variable, while, some, are, found, on, all, continents, others, as, for, example, the, white, truffle, tuber, magnatum, only, occur, in, isolated, locations, in, italy, and, eastern, europe, the, distribution, of, plant, parasitic, species, is, often, restricted, by, host, distributions, for, example, cyttaria, is, only, found, on, nothofagus, southern, beech, in, the, southern, hemisphere, asexual, reproduction, is, the, dominant, form, of, propagation, in, the, ascomycota, and, is, responsible, for, the, rapid, spread, of, these, fungi, into, new, areas, it, occurs, through, vegetative, reproductive, spores, the, conidia, the, conidiospores, commonly, contain, one, nucleus, and, are, products, of, mitotic, cell, divisions, and, thus, are, sometimes, called, mitospores, which, are, genetically, identical, to, the, mycelium, from, which, they, originate, they, are, typically, formed, at, the, ends, of, specialized, hyphae, the, conidiophores, depending, on, the, species, they, may, be, dispersed, by, wind, or, water, or, by, animals, different, types, of, asexual, spores, can, be, identified, by, colour, shape, and, how, they, are, released, as, individual, spores, spore, types, can, be, used, as, taxonomic, characters, in, the, classification, within, the, ascomycota, the, most, frequent, types, are, the, single, celled, spores, which, are, designated, amerospores, if, the, spore, is, divided, into, two, by, a, cross, wall, septum, it, is, called, a, didymospore, when, there, are, two, or, more, cross, walls, the, classification, depends, on, spore, shape, if, the, septae, are, transversal, like, the, rungs, of, a, ladder, it, is, a, phragmospore, and, if, they, possess, a, net, like, structure, it, is, a, dictyospore, in, staurospores, ray, like, arms, radiate, from, a, central, body, in, others, helicospores, the, entire, spore, is, wound, up, in, a, spiral, like, a, spring, very, long, worm, like, spores, with, a, length, to, diameter, ratio, of, more, than, 15, 1, are, called, scolecospores, important, characteristics, of, the, anamorphs, of, the, ascomycota, are, conidiogenesis, which, includes, spore, formation, and, dehiscence, separation, from, the, parent, structure, conidiogenesis, corresponds, to, embryology, in, animals, and, plants, and, can, be, divided, into, two, fundamental, forms, of, development, blastic, conidiogenesis, where, the, spore, is, already, evident, before, it, separates, from, the, conidiogenic, hypha, and, thallic, conidiogenesis, during, which, a, cross, wall, forms, and, the, newly, created, cell, develops, into, a, spore, the, spores, may, or, may, not, be, generated, in, a, large, scale, specialized, structure, that, helps, to, spread, them, these, two, basic, types, can, be, further, classified, as, follows, sometimes, the, conidia, are, produced, in, structures, visible, to, the, naked, eye, which, help, to, distribute, the, spores, these, structures, are, called, conidiomata, singular, conidioma, and, may, take, the, form, of, pycnidia, which, are, flask, shaped, and, arise, in, the, fungal, tissue, or, acervuli, which, are, cushion, shaped, and, arise, in, host, tissue, dehiscence, happens, in, two, ways, in, schizolytic, dehiscence, a, double, dividing, wall, with, a, central, lamella, layer, forms, between, the, cells, the, central, layer, then, breaks, down, thereby, releasing, the, spores, in, rhexolytic, dehiscence, the, cell, wall, that, joins, the, spores, on, the, outside, degenerates, and, releases, the, conidia, several, ascomycota, species, are, not, known, to, have, a, sexual, cycle, such, asexual, species, may, be, able, to, undergo, genetic, recombination, between, individuals, by, processes, involving, heterokaryosis, and, parasexual, events, parasexuality, refers, to, the, process, of, heterokaryosis, caused, by, merging, of, two, hyphae, belonging, to, different, individuals, by, a, process, called, anastomosis, followed, by, a, series, of, events, resulting, in, genetically, different, cell, nuclei, in, the, mycelium, the, merging, of, nuclei, is, not, followed, by, meiotic, events, such, as, gamete, formation, and, results, in, an, increased, number, of, chromosomes, per, nuclei, mitotic, crossover, may, enable, recombination, i, e, an, exchange, of, genetic, material, between, homologous, chromosomes, the, chromosome, number, may, then, be, restored, to, its, haploid, state, by, nuclear, division, with, each, daughter, nuclei, being, genetically, different, from, the, original, parent, nuclei, alternatively, nuclei, may, lose, some, chromosomes, resulting, in, aneuploid, cells, candida, albicans, class, saccharomycetes, is, an, example, of, a, fungus, that, has, a, parasexual, cycle, see, candida, albicans, and, parasexual, cycle, sexual, reproduction, in, the, ascomycota, leads, to, the, formation, of, the, ascus, the, structure, that, defines, this, fungal, group, and, distinguishes, it, from, other, fungal, phyla, the, ascus, is, a, tube, shaped, vessel, a, meiosporangium, which, contains, the, sexual, spores, produced, by, meiosis, and, which, are, called, ascospores, apart, from, a, few, exceptions, such, as, candida, albicans, most, ascomycetes, are, haploid, i, e, they, contain, one, set, of, chromosomes, per, nucleus, during, sexual, reproduction, there, is, a, diploid, phase, which, commonly, is, very, short, and, meiosis, restores, the, haploid, state, the, sexual, cycle, of, one, well, studied, representative, species, of, ascomycota, is, described, in, greater, detail, in, neurospora, crassa, also, the, adaptive, basis, for, the, maintenance, of, sexual, reproduction, in, the, ascomycota, fungi, was, reviewed, by, wallen, and, perlin, they, concluded, that, the, most, plausible, reason, for, the, maintenance, of, this, capability, is, the, benefit, of, repairing, dna, damage, by, using, recombination, that, occurs, during, meiosis, dna, damage, can, be, caused, by, a, variety, of, stresses, such, as, nutrient, limitation, the, sexual, part, of, the, life, cycle, commences, when, two, hyphal, structures, mate, in, the, case, of, homothallic, species, mating, is, enabled, between, hyphae, of, the, same, fungal, clone, whereas, in, heterothallic, species, the, two, hyphae, must, originate, from, fungal, clones, that, differ, genetically, i, e, those, that, are, of, a, different, mating, type, mating, types, are, typical, of, the, fungi, and, correspond, roughly, to, the, sexes, in, plants, and, animals, however, one, species, may, have, more, than, two, mating, types, resulting, in, sometimes, complex, vegetative, incompatibility, systems, the, adaptive, function, of, mating, type, is, discussed, in, neurospora, crassa, gametangia, are, sexual, structures, formed, from, hyphae, and, are, the, generative, cells, a, very, fine, hypha, called, trichogyne, emerges, from, one, gametangium, the, ascogonium, and, merges, with, a, gametangium, the, antheridium, of, the, other, fungal, isolate, the, nuclei, in, the, antheridium, then, migrate, into, the, ascogonium, and, plasmogamy, the, mixing, of, the, cytoplasm, occurs, unlike, in, animals, and, plants, plasmogamy, is, not, immediately, followed, by, the, merging, of, the, nuclei, called, karyogamy, instead, the, nuclei, from, the, two, hyphae, form, pairs, initiating, the, dikaryophase, of, the, sexual, cycle, during, which, time, the, pairs, of, nuclei, synchronously, divide, fusion, of, the, paired, nuclei, leads, to, mixing, of, the, genetic, material, and, recombination, and, is, followed, by, meiosis, a, similar, sexual, cycle, is, present, in, the, red, algae, rhodophyta, a, discarded, hypothesis, held, that, a, second, karyogamy, event, occurred, in, the, ascogonium, prior, to, ascogeny, resulting, in, a, tetraploid, nucleus, which, divided, into, four, diploid, nuclei, by, meiosis, and, then, into, eight, haploid, nuclei, by, a, supposed, process, called, brachymeiosis, but, this, hypothesis, was, disproven, in, the, 1950s, from, the, fertilized, ascogonium, dinucleate, hyphae, emerge, in, which, each, cell, contains, two, nuclei, these, hyphae, are, called, ascogenous, or, fertile, hyphae, they, are, supported, by, the, vegetative, mycelium, containing, uni, or, mono, nucleate, hyphae, which, are, sterile, the, mycelium, containing, both, sterile, and, fertile, hyphae, may, grow, into, fruiting, body, the, ascocarp, which, may, contain, millions, of, fertile, hyphae, an, ascocarp, is, the, fruiting, body, of, the, sexual, phase, in, ascomycota, there, are, five, morphologically, different, types, of, ascocarp, namely, the, sexual, structures, are, formed, in, the, fruiting, layer, of, the, ascocarp, the, hymenium, at, one, end, of, ascogenous, hyphae, characteristic, u, shaped, hooks, develop, which, curve, back, opposite, to, the, growth, direction, of, the, hyphae, the, two, nuclei, contained, in, the, apical, part, of, each, hypha, divide, in, such, a, way, that, the, threads, of, their, mitotic, spindles, run, parallel, creating, two, pairs, of, genetically, different, nuclei, one, daughter, nucleus, migrates, close, to, the, hook, while, the, other, daughter, nucleus, locates, to, the, basal, part, of, the, hypha, the, formation, of, two, parallel, cross, walls, then, divides, the, hypha, into, three, sections, one, at, the, hook, with, one, nucleus, one, at, the, basal, of, the, original, hypha, that, contains, one, nucleus, and, one, that, separates, the, u, shaped, part, which, contains, the, other, two, nuclei, fusion, of, the, nuclei, karyogamy, takes, place, in, the, u, shaped, cells, in, the, hymenium, and, results, in, the, formation, of, a, diploid, zygote, the, zygote, grows, into, the, ascus, an, elongated, tube, shaped, or, cylinder, shaped, capsule, meiosis, then, gives, rise, to, four, haploid, nuclei, usually, followed, by, a, further, mitotic, division, that, results, in, eight, nuclei, in, each, ascus, the, nuclei, along, with, some, cytoplasma, become, enclosed, within, membranes, and, a, cell, wall, to, give, rise, to, ascospores, that, are, aligned, inside, the, ascus, like, peas, in, a, pod, upon, opening, of, the, ascus, ascospores, may, be, dispersed, by, the, wind, while, in, some, cases, the, spores, are, forcibly, ejected, form, the, ascus, certain, species, have, evolved, spore, cannons, which, can, eject, ascospores, up, to, 30, cm, away, when, the, spores, reach, a, suitable, substrate, they, germinate, form, new, hyphae, which, restarts, the, fungal, life, cycle, the, form, of, the, ascus, is, important, for, classification, and, is, divided, into, four, basic, types, unitunicate, operculate, unitunicate, inoperculate, bitunicate, or, prototunicate, see, the, article, on, asci, for, further, details, the, ascomycota, fulfil, a, central, role, in, most, land, based, ecosystems, they, are, important, decomposers, breaking, down, organic, materials, such, as, dead, leaves, and, animals, and, helping, the, detritivores, animals, that, feed, on, decomposing, material, to, obtain, their, nutrients, ascomycetes, along, with, other, fungi, can, break, down, large, molecules, such, as, cellulose, or, lignin, and, thus, have, important, roles, in, nutrient, cycling, such, as, the, carbon, cycle, the, fruiting, bodies, of, the, ascomycota, provide, food, for, many, animals, ranging, from, insects, and, slugs, and, snails, gastropoda, to, rodents, and, larger, mammals, such, as, deer, and, wild, boars, many, ascomycetes, also, form, symbiotic, relationships, with, other, organisms, including, plants, and, animals, probably, since, early, in, their, evolutionary, history, the, ascomycota, have, formed, symbiotic, associations, with, green, algae, chlorophyta, and, other, types, of, algae, and, cyanobacteria, these, mutualistic, associations, are, commonly, known, as, lichens, and, can, grow, and, persist, in, terrestrial, regions, of, the, earth, that, are, inhospitable, to, other, organisms, and, characterized, by, extremes, in, temperature, and, humidity, including, the, arctic, the, antarctic, deserts, and, mountaintops, while, the, photoautotrophic, algal, partner, generates, metabolic, energy, through, photosynthesis, the, fungus, offers, a, stable, supportive, matrix, and, protects, cells, from, radiation, and, dehydration, around, 42, of, the, ascomycota, about, 18, 000, species, form, lichens, and, almost, all, the, fungal, partners, of, lichens, belong, to, the, ascomycota, members, of, the, ascomycota, form, two, important, types, of, relationship, with, plants, as, mycorrhizal, fungi, and, as, endophytes, mycorrhiza, are, symbiotic, associations, of, fungi, with, the, root, systems, of, the, plants, which, can, be, of, vital, importance, for, growth, and, persistence, for, the, plant, the, fine, mycelial, network, of, the, fungus, enables, the, increased, uptake, of, mineral, salts, that, occur, at, low, levels, in, the, soil, in, return, the, plant, provides, the, fungus, with, metabolic, energy, in, the, form, of, photosynthetic, products, endophytic, fungi, live, inside, plants, and, those, that, form, mutualistic, or, commensal, associations, with, their, host, do, not, damage, their, hosts, the, exact, nature, of, the, relationship, between, endophytic, fungus, and, host, depends, on, the, species, involved, and, in, some, cases, fungal, colonization, of, plants, can, bestow, a, higher, resistance, against, insects, roundworms, nematodes, and, bacteria, in, the, case, of, grass, endophytes, the, fungal, symbiont, produces, poisonous, alkaloids, which, can, affect, the, health, of, plant, eating, herbivorous, mammals, and, deter, or, kill, insect, herbivores, several, ascomycetes, of, the, genus, xylaria, colonize, the, nests, of, leafcutter, ants, and, other, fungus, growing, ants, of, the, tribe, attini, and, the, fungal, gardens, of, termites, isoptera, since, they, do, not, generate, fruiting, bodies, until, the, insects, have, left, the, nests, it, is, suspected, that, as, confirmed, in, several, cases, of, basidiomycota, species, they, may, be, cultivated, bark, beetles, family, scolytidae, are, important, symbiotic, partners, of, ascomycetes, the, female, beetles, transport, fungal, spores, to, new, hosts, in, characteristic, tucks, in, their, skin, the, mycetangia, the, beetle, tunnels, into, the, wood, and, into, large, chambers, in, which, they, lay, their, eggs, spores, released, from, the, mycetangia, germinate, into, hyphae, which, can, break, down, the, wood, the, beetle, larvae, then, feed, on, the, fungal, mycelium, and, on, reaching, maturity, carry, new, spores, with, them, to, renew, the, cycle, of, infection, a, well, known, example, of, this, is, dutch, elm, disease, caused, by, ophiostoma, ulmi, which, is, carried, by, the, european, elm, bark, beetle, scolytus, multistriatus, one, of, their, most, harmful, roles, is, as, the, agent, of, many, plant, diseases, for, instance, on, the, other, hand, ascus, fungi, have, brought, some, important, benefits, to, humanity
