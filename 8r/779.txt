the, aurochs, bos, primigenius, r, k, s, or, a, r, k, s, plural, aurochs, or, aurochsen, is, an, extinct, cattle, species, considered, to, be, the, wild, ancestor, of, modern, domestic, cattle, with, a, shoulder, height, of, up, to, 180, cm, 71, in, in, bulls, and, 155, cm, 61, in, in, cows, it, was, one, of, the, largest, herbivores, in, the, holocene, it, had, massive, elongated, and, broad, horns, that, reached, 80, cm, 31, in, in, length, the, aurochs, was, part, of, the, pleistocene, megafauna, it, probably, evolved, in, asia, and, migrated, west, and, north, during, warm, interglacial, periods, the, oldest, known, aurochs, fossils, found, in, india, and, north, africa, date, to, the, middle, pleistocene, and, in, europe, to, the, holstein, interglacial, as, indicated, by, fossil, remains, in, northern, europe, it, reached, denmark, and, southern, sweden, during, the, holocene, the, aurochs, declined, during, the, late, holocene, due, to, habitat, loss, and, hunting, and, became, extinct, around, the, 17th, century, the, aurochs, is, depicted, in, paleolithic, cave, paintings, neolithic, petroglyphs, ancient, egyptian, reliefs, and, bronze, age, figurines, it, symbolised, power, sexual, potency, and, prowess, in, religions, of, the, ancient, near, east, its, horns, were, used, in, votive, offerings, as, trophies, and, drinking, horns, two, aurochs, domestication, events, occurred, during, the, neolithic, revolution, one, gave, rise, to, the, domestic, cattle, bos, taurus, in, the, fertile, crescent, in, the, near, east, that, was, introduced, to, europe, via, the, balkans, and, the, coast, of, the, mediterranean, sea, hybridisation, between, aurochs, and, early, domestic, cattle, occurred, during, the, early, holocene, domestication, of, the, indian, aurochs, led, to, the, zebu, cattle, bos, indicus, that, hybridised, with, early, taurine, cattle, in, the, near, east, about, 4, 000, years, ago, some, modern, cattle, breeds, exhibit, features, reminiscent, of, the, aurochs, such, as, the, dark, colour, and, light, eel, stripe, along, the, back, of, bulls, the, lighter, colour, of, cows, or, an, aurochs, like, horn, shape, both, aur, and, ur, are, germanic, or, celtic, words, meaning, wild, ox, in, old, high, german, this, word, was, compounded, with, ohso, ox, to, rohso, which, became, the, early, modern, aurochs, the, latin, word, urus, was, used, for, wild, ox, from, the, gallic, wars, onwards, the, use, of, the, plural, form, aurochsen, in, english, is, a, direct, parallel, of, the, german, plural, ochsen, and, recreates, the, same, distinction, by, analogy, as, english, singular, ox, and, plural, oxen, although, aurochs, may, stand, for, both, the, singular, and, the, plural, term, both, are, attested, the, scientific, name, bos, taurus, was, introduced, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, for, feral, cattle, in, poland, the, scientific, name, bos, primigenius, was, proposed, for, the, aurochs, by, ludwig, heinrich, bojanus, who, described, the, skeletal, differences, between, the, aurochs, and, domestic, cattle, in, 1825, published, in, 1827, the, name, bos, namadicus, was, used, by, hugh, falconer, in, 1859, for, cattle, fossils, found, in, nerbudda, deposits, bos, primigenius, mauritanicus, was, coined, by, philippe, thomas, in, 1881, who, described, fossils, found, in, deposits, near, oued, seguen, west, of, constantine, algeria, in, 2003, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, placed, bos, primigenius, on, the, official, list, of, specific, names, in, zoology, and, thereby, recognized, the, validity, of, this, name, for, a, wild, species, four, aurochs, subspecies, are, recognised, calibrations, using, fossils, of, 16, bovidae, species, indicate, that, the, bovini, tribe, evolved, about, 11, 7, million, years, ago, the, bos, and, bison, genetic, lineages, are, estimated, to, have, genetically, diverged, from, the, bovini, about, 2, 5, to, 1, 65, million, years, ago, the, following, cladogram, shows, the, phylogenetic, relationships, of, the, aurochs, based, on, analysis, of, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, genomes, in, the, bovini, tribe, bubalina, buffalo, bos, primigenius, aurochs, bos, mutus, wild, yak, bison, bison, american, bison, bison, bonasus, european, bison, wisent, bos, javanicus, banteng, bos, gaurus, gaur, bos, sauveli, kouprey, the, cold, pliocene, climate, caused, an, extension, of, open, grassland, which, enabled, the, evolution, of, large, grazers, bos, acutifrons, is, a, possible, ancestor, of, the, aurochs, of, which, a, fossil, skull, was, excavated, in, the, sivalik, hills, in, india, that, dates, to, the, early, pleistocene, about, 2, million, years, ago, an, aurochs, skull, excavated, in, tunisia, s, kef, governorate, from, early, middle, pleistocene, strata, dating, about, 0, 78, million, years, ago, is, the, oldest, known, fossil, specimen, to, date, indicating, that, the, genus, bos, might, have, evolved, in, africa, and, migrated, to, eurasia, during, the, middle, pleistocene, middle, pleistocene, aurochs, fossils, were, also, excavated, in, a, saharan, erg, in, the, hoggar, mountains, the, earliest, aurochs, fossils, excavated, in, europe, date, to, the, holstein, interglacial, 230, 000, years, before, present, bp, a, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, showed, that, hybridisation, between, the, aurochs, and, the, steppe, bison, bos, priscus, occurred, about, 120, 000, years, ago, the, european, bison, bos, bonasus, contains, up, to, 10, aurochs, ancestry, fossils, of, the, indian, subspecies, bos, primigenius, namadicus, were, excavated, in, alluvial, deposits, in, south, india, dating, to, the, middle, pleistocene, this, lead, van, vuure, to, conclude, that, it, possibly, migrated, west, into, the, middle, east, during, the, middle, or, late, pleistocene, late, pleistocene, aurochs, fossils, were, found, in, affad, 23, in, sudan, dating, to, 50, 000, years, ago, when, the, climate, in, this, region, was, more, humid, than, during, the, african, humid, period, two, aurochs, bones, found, in, the, romito, cave, in, italy, were, radiocarbon, dated, to, 20, 210, and, 19, 351, years, bp, aurochs, bones, found, in, a, cave, near, san, teodoro, sicily, date, to, the, late, epigravettian, 14, 785, 14, 781, years, bp, fossils, found, at, various, locations, in, denmark, date, to, the, holocene, 9, 925, 2, 865, years, bp, mesowear, analysis, of, aurochs, premolar, teeth, indicates, that, it, changed, from, an, abrasion, dominated, grazer, in, the, danish, preboreal, to, a, mixed, feeder, in, the, boreal, atlantic, and, subboreal, periods, of, the, holocene, according, to, a, 16th, century, description, by, sigismund, von, herberstein, the, aurochs, was, pitch, black, with, a, grey, streak, along, the, back, his, wood, carving, made, in, 1556, was, based, on, a, culled, aurochs, which, he, had, received, in, mazovia, in, 1827, charles, hamilton, smith, published, an, image, of, an, aurochs, that, was, based, on, an, oil, painting, that, he, had, purchased, from, a, merchant, in, augsburg, which, is, thought, to, have, been, made, in, the, early, 16th, century, this, painting, is, thought, to, have, shown, an, aurochs, although, some, authors, suggested, it, may, have, shown, a, hybrid, between, an, aurochs, and, domestic, cattle, or, a, polish, steer, contemporary, reconstructions, of, the, aurochs, are, based, on, skeletons, and, the, information, derived, from, contemporaneous, artistic, depictions, and, historic, descriptions, of, the, animal, remains, of, aurochs, hair, were, not, known, until, the, early, 1980s, depictions, show, that, the, north, african, aurochs, may, have, had, a, light, saddle, marking, on, its, back, calves, were, probably, born, with, a, chestnut, colour, and, young, bulls, changed, to, black, with, a, white, eel, stripe, running, down, the, spine, while, cows, retained, a, reddish, brown, colour, both, sexes, had, a, light, coloured, muzzle, but, evidence, for, variation, in, coat, colour, does, not, exist, egyptian, grave, paintings, show, cattle, with, a, reddish, brown, coat, colour, in, both, sexes, with, a, light, saddle, but, the, horn, shape, of, these, suggest, that, they, may, depict, domesticated, cattle, many, primitive, cattle, breeds, particularly, those, from, southern, europe, display, similar, coat, colours, to, the, aurochs, including, the, black, colour, in, bulls, with, a, light, eel, stripe, a, pale, mouth, and, similar, sexual, dimorphism, in, colour, a, feature, often, attributed, to, the, aurochs, is, blond, forehead, hairs, according, to, historical, descriptions, of, the, aurochs, it, had, long, and, curly, forehead, hair, but, none, mentions, a, certain, colour, although, the, colour, is, present, in, a, variety, of, primitive, cattle, breeds, it, is, probably, a, discolouration, that, appeared, after, domestication, the, proportions, and, body, shape, of, the, aurochs, were, strikingly, different, from, many, modern, cattle, breeds, for, example, the, legs, were, considerably, longer, and, more, slender, resulting, in, a, shoulder, height, that, nearly, equalled, the, trunk, length, the, skull, carrying, the, large, horns, was, substantially, larger, and, more, elongated, than, in, most, cattle, breeds, as, in, other, wild, bovines, the, body, shape, of, the, aurochs, was, athletic, and, especially, in, bulls, showed, a, strongly, expressed, neck, and, shoulder, musculature, therefore, the, fore, hand, was, larger, than, the, rear, similar, to, the, wisent, but, unlike, many, domesticated, cattle, even, in, carrying, cows, the, udder, was, small, and, hardly, visible, from, the, side, this, feature, is, equal, to, that, of, other, wild, bovines, the, aurochs, was, one, of, the, largest, herbivores, in, holocene, europe, the, size, of, an, aurochs, appears, to, have, varied, by, region, with, larger, specimens, in, northern, europe, than, farther, south, aurochs, in, denmark, and, germany, ranged, in, height, at, the, shoulders, between, 155, 180, cm, 61, 71, in, in, bulls, and, 135, 155, cm, 53, 61, in, in, cows, while, aurochs, bulls, in, hungary, reached, 160, cm, 63, in, the, african, aurochs, was, similar, in, size, to, the, european, aurochs, in, the, pleistocene, but, declined, in, size, during, the, transition, to, the, holocene, it, may, have, also, varied, in, size, geographically, the, body, mass, of, aurochs, appears, to, have, shown, some, variability, some, individuals, reached, around, 700, kg, 1, 540, lb, whereas, those, from, the, late, middle, pleistocene, are, estimated, to, have, weighed, up, to, 1, 500, kg, 3, 310, lb, the, aurochs, exhibited, considerable, sexual, dimorphism, in, the, size, of, males, and, females, the, horns, were, massive, reaching, 80, cm, 31, in, in, length, and, between, 10, and, 20, cm, 3, 9, and, 7, 9, in, in, diameter, its, horns, grew, from, the, skull, at, a, 60, degree, angle, to, the, muzzle, facing, forwards, and, were, curved, in, three, directions, namely, upwards, and, outwards, at, the, base, then, swinging, forwards, and, inwards, then, inwards, and, upwards, the, curvature, of, bull, horns, was, more, strongly, expressed, than, horns, of, cows, the, basal, circumference, of, horn, cores, reached, 44, 5, cm, 17, 5, in, in, the, largest, chinese, specimen, and, 48, cm, 19, in, in, a, french, specimen, some, cattle, breeds, still, show, horn, shapes, similar, to, that, of, the, aurochs, such, as, the, spanish, fighting, bull, and, occasionally, also, individuals, of, derived, breeds, a, well, preserved, aurochs, bone, yielded, sufficient, mitochondrial, dna, for, a, sequence, analysis, which, showed, that, its, genome, consists, of, 16, 338, base, pairs, further, studies, using, the, aurochs, whole, genome, sequence, have, identified, candidate, microrna, regulated, domestication, genes, the, aurochs, was, widely, distributed, in, north, africa, mesopotamia, and, throughout, europe, to, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, caucasus, and, western, siberia, in, the, west, and, to, the, gulf, of, finland, and, lake, ladoga, in, the, north, fossil, horns, attributed, to, the, aurochs, were, found, in, late, pleistocene, deposits, at, an, elevation, of, 3, 400, m, 11, 200, ft, on, the, eastern, margin, of, the, tibetan, plateau, close, to, the, heihe, river, in, zoig, county, that, date, to, about, 26, 620, 600, years, bp, most, fossils, in, china, were, found, in, plains, below, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, in, heilongjiang, yushu, jilin, northeastern, manchuria, inner, mongolia, near, beijing, yangyuan, county, in, hebei, province, datong, and, dingcun, in, shanxi, province, huan, county, in, gansu, and, in, guizhou, provinces, ancient, dna, in, aurochs, fossils, found, in, northeast, china, indicate, that, the, aurochs, survived, in, the, region, until, at, least, 5, 000, years, bp, fossils, were, also, excavated, on, the, korean, peninsula, and, in, the, japanese, archipelago, landscapes, in, europe, probably, consisted, of, dense, forests, throughout, much, of, the, last, few, thousand, years, the, aurochs, is, likely, to, have, used, riparian, forests, and, wetlands, along, lakes, pollen, of, mostly, small, shrubs, found, in, fossiliferous, sediments, with, aurochs, remains, in, china, indicate, that, it, preferred, temperate, grassy, plains, or, grasslands, bordering, woodlands, it, may, have, also, lived, in, open, grasslands, in, the, warm, atlantic, period, of, the, holocene, it, was, restricted, to, remaining, open, country, and, forest, margins, where, competition, with, livestock, and, humans, gradually, increased, leading, to, a, successive, decline, of, the, aurochs, the, indian, aurochs, b, p, namadicus, became, extinct, during, the, indus, valley, civilisation, likely, due, to, habitat, loss, caused, by, expanding, pastoralism, and, interbreeding, with, the, domestic, zebu, the, latest, known, remains, were, dated, to, 3, 800, ybp, making, it, the, first, of, the, three, aurochs, subspecies, to, die, out, the, african, aurochs, b, p, mauritanicus, may, have, survived, until, at, least, to, the, roman, period, as, indicated, by, fossils, found, in, buto, and, faiyum, in, the, nile, delta, the, eurasian, aurochs, b, p, primigenius, was, present, in, southern, sweden, during, the, holocene, climatic, optimum, until, at, least, 7, 800, years, bp, in, denmark, the, first, known, local, extinction, of, the, aurochs, occurred, after, the, sea, level, rise, on, the, newly, formed, danish, islands, about, 8, 000, 7, 500, years, bp, and, the, last, documented, aurochs, lived, in, southern, jutland, around, 3, 000, years, bp, the, latest, known, aurochs, fossil, in, great, britain, dates, to, 3, 245, years, bp, and, it, was, probably, extinct, by, 3, 000, years, ago, excessive, hunting, began, and, continued, until, the, aurochs, was, nearly, extinct, the, gradual, extinction, of, the, aurochs, in, central, europe, was, concurrent, with, the, clearcutting, of, large, forest, tracts, between, the, 9th, and, 12th, centuries, by, the, 13th, century, the, aurochs, existed, only, in, small, numbers, in, eastern, europe, and, hunting, it, became, a, privilege, of, nobles, and, later, royals, the, population, in, hungary, was, declining, from, at, least, the, 9th, century, and, was, extinct, in, the, 13th, century, findings, from, subfossil, records, indicate, that, wild, aurochs, might, have, survived, in, northwestern, transylvania, until, the, 14th, to, 16th, century, in, western, moldavia, until, probably, the, early, 17th, century, the, last, known, aurochs, herd, lived, in, a, marshy, woodland, in, poland, s, jaktor, w, forest, it, decreased, from, around, 50, individuals, in, the, mid, 16th, century, to, four, individuals, by, 1601, the, last, aurochs, cow, died, in, 1627, from, natural, causes, a, 2021, study, argued, that, the, aurochs, possibly, survived, in, northeastern, bulgaria, until, at, least, the, 17th, century, a, horn, core, excavated, in, 2020, in, sofia, was, identified, as, being, from, an, aurochs, the, archaeological, layer, in, which, it, was, found, was, dated, to, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, or, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, suggesting, that, aurochs, may, have, survived, in, bulgaria, until, that, date, aurochs, formed, small, herds, mainly, in, winter, but, typically, lived, singly, or, in, smaller, groups, during, the, summer, if, aurochs, had, social, behaviour, similar, to, their, descendants, social, status, would, have, been, gained, through, displays, and, fights, in, which, both, cows, and, bulls, engaged, with, its, hypsodont, jaw, the, aurochs, was, probably, a, grazer, with, a, food, selection, very, similar, to, domesticated, cattle, feeding, on, grass, twigs, and, acorns, mating, season, was, in, september, and, calves, were, born, in, spring, rutting, bulls, had, violent, fights, and, evidence, from, the, jaktor, w, forest, shows, that, they, were, fully, capable, of, mortally, wounding, one, another, in, autumn, aurochs, fed, for, the, winter, gaining, weight, and, possessing, a, shinier, coat, than, during, the, rest, of, the, year, calves, stayed, with, their, mothers, until, they, were, strong, enough, to, join, and, keep, up, with, the, herd, on, the, feeding, grounds, aurochs, calves, would, have, been, vulnerable, to, predation, by, grey, wolves, canis, lupus, and, brown, bears, ursus, arctos, while, the, immense, size, and, strength, of, healthy, adult, aurochs, meant, they, likely, did, not, need, to, fear, most, predators, the, lion, panthera, leo, tiger, panthera, tigris, and, spotted, hyena, crocuta, crocuta, were, probable, predators, in, prehistoric, times, according, to, historical, descriptions, the, aurochs, was, swift, despite, its, build, and, could, be, very, aggressive, if, provoked, but, was, not, generally, fearful, of, humans, acheulean, layers, in, hunasagi, on, india, s, southern, deccan, plateau, yielded, aurochs, bones, with, cut, marks, an, aurochs, bone, with, cut, marks, induced, with, flint, was, found, in, a, middle, paleolithic, layer, at, the, nesher, ramla, homo, site, in, israel, it, was, dated, to, marine, isotope, stage, 5,

behaving, badly, and, a, bloke, like, an, aurochs, for, big, and, strong, people, the, earliest, known, domestication, of, the, aurochs, dates, to, the, neolithic, revolution, in, the, fertile, crescent, where, cattle, hunted, and, kept, by, neolithic, farmers, gradually, decreased, in, size, between, 9800, and, 7500, bc, aurochs, bones, found, at, mureybet, and, g, bekli, tepe, are, larger, in, size, than, cattle, bones, from, later, neolithic, settlements, in, northern, syria, like, dja, de, el, mughara, and, tell, halula, in, late, neolithic, sites, of, northern, iraq, and, western, iran, dating, to, the, sixth, millennium, bc, cattle, remains, are, also, smaller, but, more, frequent, indicating, that, domesticated, cattle, were, imported, during, the, halaf, culture, from, the, central, fertile, crescent, region, results, of, genetic, research, indicate, that, the, modern, taurine, cattle, bos, taurus, arose, from, 80, aurochs, tamed, in, southeastern, anatolia, and, northern, syria, about, 10, 500, years, ago, taurine, cattle, spread, into, the, balkans, and, northern, italy, along, the, danube, river, and, the, coast, of, the, mediterranean, sea, hybridisation, between, male, aurochs, and, early, domestic, cattle, occurred, in, central, europe, between, 9500, and, 1000, bc, analyses, of, mitochondrial, dna, sequences, of, italian, aurochs, specimens, dated, to, 17, 7, 000, years, ago, and, 51, modern, cattle, breeds, revealed, some, degree, of, introgression, of, aurochs, genes, into, south, european, cattle, indicating, that, female, aurochs, had, contact, with, free, ranging, domestic, cattle, cattle, bones, of, various, sizes, found, at, a, chalcolithic, settlement, in, the, kutn, hora, district, provide, further, evidence, for, hybridisation, of, aurochs, and, domestic, cattle, between, 3000, and, 2800, bc, in, the, bohemian, region, whole, genome, sequencing, of, a, 6, 750, year, old, aurochs, bone, found, in, england, was, compared, with, genome, sequence, data, of, 81, cattle, and, single, nucleotide, polymorphism, data, of, 1, 225, cattle, results, revealed, that, british, and, irish, cattle, breeds, share, some, genetic, variants, with, the, aurochs, specimen, early, herders, in, britain, might, have, been, responsible, for, the, local, gene, flow, from, aurochs, into, the, ancestors, of, british, and, irish, cattle, the, murboden, cattle, breed, also, exhibits, sporadic, introgression, of, female, european, aurochs, into, domestic, cattle, in, the, alps, domestic, cattle, continued, to, diminish, in, both, body, and, horn, size, until, the, middle, ages, the, indian, aurochs, is, thought, to, have, been, domesticated, 10, 8, 000, years, ago, aurochs, fossils, found, at, the, neolithic, site, of, mehrgarh, in, pakistan, are, dated, to, around, 8, 000, years, bp, and, represent, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, for, its, domestication, on, the, indian, subcontinent, female, indian, aurochs, contributed, to, the, gene, pool, of, zebu, bos, indicus, between, 5, 500, and, 4, 000, years, bp, during, the, expansion, of, pastoralism, in, northern, india, the, zebu, initially, spread, eastwards, to, southeast, asia, hybridisation, between, zebu, and, early, taurine, cattle, occurred, in, the, near, east, after, 4, 000, years, bp, coinciding, with, the, drought, period, during, the, 4, 2, kiloyear, event, the, zebu, was, introduced, to, east, africa, about, 3, 500, 2, 500, years, ago, and, reached, mongolia, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, a, third, domestication, event, thought, to, have, occurred, in, egypt, s, western, desert, is, not, supported, by, results, of, an, analysis, of, genetic, admixture, introgression, and, migration, patterns, of, 3, 196, domestic, cattle, representing, 180, populations, in, the, early, 1920s, heinz, heck, initiated, a, selective, breeding, program, in, hellabrunn, zoo, attempting, to, breed, back, the, aurochs, using, several, cattle, breeds, the, result, is, called, heck, cattle, herds, of, these, cattle, were, released, to, oostvaardersplassen, a, polder, in, the, netherlands, in, the, 1980s, as, aurochs, surrogates, for, naturalistic, grazing, with, the, aim, to, restore, prehistorical, landscapes, large, numbers, of, them, died, of, starvation, during, the, cold, winters, of, 2005, and, 2010, and, the, project, of, no, interference, ended, in, 2018, starting, in, 1996, heck, cattle, were, crossed, with, southern, european, cattle, breeds, such, as, sayaguesa, cattle, chianina, and, to, a, lesser, extent, spanish, fighting, bulls, in, the, hope, of, creating, a, more, aurochs, like, animal, the, resulting, crossbreeds, are, called, taurus, cattle, other, breeding, back, projects, are, the, tauros, programme, and, the, uruz, project, however, approaches, aiming, at, breeding, an, aurochs, like, phenotype, do, not, equate, to, an, aurochs, like, genotype
