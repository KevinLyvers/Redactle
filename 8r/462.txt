sarcopterygii, s, r, k, p, t, r, d, i, a, from, ancient, greek, s, rx, flesh, and, pt, rux, wing, fin, sometimes, considered, synonymous, with, crossopterygii, from, ancient, greek, kross, s, fringe, is, a, clade, traditionally, a, class, or, subclass, of, vertebrate, animals, which, includes, a, group, of, bony, fish, commonly, referred, to, as, lobe, finned, fish, these, vertebrates, are, characterised, by, prominent, muscular, limb, buds, lobes, within, their, fins, which, are, supported, by, articulated, appendicular, skeletons, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, other, clade, of, bony, fish, the, actinopterygii, which, have, only, skin, covered, bony, spines, supporting, the, fins, the, tetrapods, a, mostly, terrestrial, superclass, of, vertebrates, are, now, recognized, as, having, evolved, from, sarcopterygian, ancestors, and, are, most, closely, related, to, lungfishes, their, paired, pectoral, and, pelvic, fins, evolved, into, limbs, and, their, foregut, diverticulum, eventually, evolved, into, air, breathing, lungs, cladistically, this, would, make, the, tetrapods, a, subgroup, within, sarcopterygii, and, thus, sarcopterygians, themselves, as, a, result, the, phrase, lobe, finned, fish, normally, refers, to, not, the, entire, clade, but, only, aquatic, members, that, are, not, tetrapods, non, tetrapod, sarcopterygians, were, once, the, dominant, predators, of, freshwater, ecosystems, during, the, carboniferous, and, permian, periods, but, suffered, significant, decline, after, the, great, dying, the, only, known, extant, non, tetrapod, sarcopterygians, are, the, two, species, of, coelacanths, and, six, species, of, lungfishes, early, lobe, finned, fishes, are, bony, fish, with, fleshy, lobed, paired, fins, which, are, joined, to, the, body, by, a, single, bone, the, fins, of, lobe, finned, fishes, differ, from, those, of, all, other, fish, in, that, each, is, borne, on, a, fleshy, lobelike, scaly, stalk, extending, from, the, body, that, resembles, a, limb, bud, the, scales, of, sarcopterygians, are, true, scaloids, consisting, of, lamellar, bone, surrounded, by, layers, of, vascular, bone, cosmine, similar, to, dentin, and, external, keratin, the, physical, structure, of, tetrapodomorphs, fish, bearing, resemblance, to, tetrapods, provides, valuable, insights, into, the, evolutionary, shift, from, aquatic, to, terrestrial, existence, pectoral, and, pelvic, fins, have, articulations, resembling, those, of, tetrapod, limbs, the, first, tetrapod, land, vertebrates, basal, amphibian, organisms, possessed, legs, derived, from, these, fins, sarcopterygians, also, possess, two, dorsal, fins, with, separate, bases, as, opposed, to, the, single, dorsal, fin, in, ray, finned, fish, the, braincase, of, sarcopterygians, primitively, has, a, hinge, line, but, this, is, lost, in, tetrapods, and, lungfish, early, sarcopterygians, commonly, exhibit, a, symmetrical, tail, while, all, sarcopterygians, possess, teeth, that, are, coated, with, genuine, enamel, most, species, of, lobe, finned, fishes, are, extinct, the, largest, known, lobe, finned, fish, was, rhizodus, hibberti, from, the, carboniferous, period, of, scotland, which, may, have, exceeded, 7, meters, in, length, among, the, two, groups, of, living, species, the, coelacanths, and, the, lungfishes, the, largest, species, is, the, west, indian, ocean, coelacanth, reaching, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, length, and, weighing, up, 110, kg, 240, lb, the, largest, lungfish, is, the, marbled, lungfish, which, can, reach, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, in, length, and, weigh, up, to, 50, kg, 110, lb, taxonomists, who, adhere, to, the, cladistic, approach, include, tetrapoda, within, this, classification, encompassing, all, species, of, vertebrates, with, four, limbs, the, fin, limbs, found, in, lobe, finned, fishes, like, the, coelacanths, display, a, strong, resemblance, to, the, presumed, ancestral, form, of, tetrapod, limbs, lobe, finned, fishes, seemingly, underwent, two, distinct, evolutionary, paths, leading, to, their, classification, into, two, subclasses, the, rhipidistia, comprising, the, dipnoi, or, lungfish, and, the, tetrapodomorpha, which, includes, the, tetrapoda, and, the, actinistia, represented, by, coelacanths, the, classification, below, follows, benton, 2004, and, uses, a, synthesis, of, rank, based, linnaean, taxonomy, and, also, reflects, evolutionary, relationships, benton, included, the, superclass, tetrapoda, in, the, subclass, sarcopterygii, in, order, to, reflect, the, direct, descent, of, tetrapods, from, lobe, finned, fish, despite, the, former, being, assigned, a, higher, taxonomic, rank, lobe, finned, fishes, and, their, sister, group, the, ray, finned, fishes, make, up, the, superclass, osteichthyes, characterized, by, the, presence, of, swim, bladders, which, share, ancestry, with, lungs, as, well, as, the, evolution, of, ossified, endoskeleton, instead, of, cartilages, like, the, skeletons, of, acanthodians, chondrichthyians, and, most, placoderms, there, are, otherwise, vast, differences, in, fin, respiratory, and, circulatory, structures, between, the, sarcopterygii, and, the, actinopterygii, such, as, the, presence, of, cosmoid, layers, in, the, scales, of, sarcopterygians, the, earliest, sarcopterygian, fossils, were, found, in, the, uppermost, silurian, about, 418, ma, they, closely, resembled, the, acanthodians, the, spiny, fish, a, taxon, that, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, paleozoic, in, the, early, middle, devonian, 416, 385, ma, while, the, predatory, placoderms, dominated, the, seas, some, sarcopterygians, came, into, freshwater, habitats, in, the, early, devonian, 416, 397, ma, the, sarcopterygians, or, lobe, finned, fishes, split, into, two, main, lineages, the, coelacanths, and, the, rhipidistians, coelacanths, never, left, the, oceans, and, their, heyday, was, the, late, devonian, and, carboniferous, from, 385, to, 299, ma, as, they, were, more, common, during, those, periods, than, in, any, other, period, in, the, phanerozoic, coelacanths, of, the, genus, latimeria, still, live, today, in, the, open, oceans, and, retained, many, primordial, features, of, ancient, sarcopterygians, earning, them, a, reputation, as, living, fossils, the, rhipidistians, whose, ancestors, probably, lived, in, the, oceans, near, river, mouths, and, estuaries, left, the, marine, world, and, migrated, into, freshwater, habitats, they, then, split, into, two, major, groups, the, lungfish, and, the, tetrapodomorphs, and, both, of, them, evolved, their, swim, bladders, into, air, breathing, lungs, lungfish, radiated, into, their, greatest, diversity, during, the, triassic, period, today, fewer, than, a, dozen, genera, remain, having, evolved, the, first, proto, lungs, and, proto, limbs, adapting, to, living, outside, a, submerged, water, environment, by, the, middle, devonian, 397, 385, ma, the, tetrapodomorphs, on, the, other, hand, evolved, into, the, fully, limbed, stegocephalians, and, later, the, fully, terrestrial, tetrapods, during, the, late, devonian, when, the, late, devonian, extinction, bottlenecked, and, selected, against, the, more, aquatically, adapted, groups, among, stem, tetrapods, the, surviving, tetrapods, then, underwent, adaptive, radiation, on, dry, land, and, become, the, dominant, terrestrial, animals, during, the, carboniferous, and, the, permian, periods, there, are, three, major, hypotheses, as, to, how, lungfish, evolved, their, stubby, fins, proto, limbs, the, first, tetrapodomorphs, which, included, the, gigantic, rhizodonts, had, the, same, general, anatomy, as, the, lungfish, who, were, their, closest, kin, but, they, appear, not, to, have, left, their, water, habitat, until, the, late, devonian, epoch, 385, 359, ma, with, the, appearance, of, tetrapods, four, legged, vertebrates, tetrapods, and, megalichthyids, are, the, only, tetrapodomorphs, which, survived, after, the, devonian, with, the, latter, group, disappearing, during, the, permian, non, tetrapod, sarcopterygians, continued, until, towards, the, end, of, paleozoic, era, suffering, heavy, losses, during, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, 251, ma, the, cladogram, presented, below, is, based, on, studies, compiled, by, janvier, et, al, 1997, for, the, tree, of, life, web,
