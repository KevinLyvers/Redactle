nightjars, are, medium, sized, nocturnal, or, crepuscular, birds, in, the, family, caprimulgidae, k, p, r, m, l, d, d, i, and, order, caprimulgiformes, characterised, by, long, wings, short, legs, and, very, short, bills, they, are, sometimes, called, bugeaters, their, primary, source, of, food, being, insects, some, new, world, species, are, called, nighthawks, the, english, word, nightjar, originally, referred, to, the, european, nightjar, nightjars, are, found, all, around, the, world, with, the, exception, of, antarctica, and, certain, island, groups, such, as, the, seychelles, they, can, be, found, in, a, variety, of, habitats, most, commonly, the, open, country, with, some, vegetation, they, usually, nest, on, the, ground, with, a, habit, of, resting, and, roosting, on, roads, the, subfamilies, of, nightjars, have, similar, characteristics, including, small, feet, of, little, use, for, walking, and, long, pointed, wings, typical, nightjars, have, rictal, bristles, longer, bills, and, softer, plumage, the, colour, of, their, plumage, and, their, unusual, perching, habits, help, conceal, them, during, the, day, previously, all, members, of, the, orders, apodiformes, aegotheliformes, nyctibiiformes, podargiformes, and, steatornithiformes, were, lumped, alongside, nightjars, in, the, caprimulgiformes, in, 2021, the, international, ornithological, congress, redefined, the, caprimulgiformes, as, only, applying, to, nightjars, with, potoos, frogmouths, oilbirds, and, owlet, nightjars, all, being, reclassified, into, their, own, orders, see, strisores, for, more, info, about, the, disputes, over, the, taxonomy, of, caprimulgiformes, a, phylogenetic, analysis, found, that, the, extinct, family, archaeotrogonidae, known, from, the, eocene, and, oligocene, of, europe, are, the, closest, known, relatives, of, nightjars, traditionally, nightjars, have, been, divided, into, two, subfamilies, the, caprimulginae, or, typical, nightjars, with, 79, known, species, and, the, chordeilinae, or, nighthawks, of, the, new, world, with, 10, known, species, the, groups, are, similar, in, most, respects, but, the, typical, nightjars, have, rictal, bristles, longer, bills, and, softer, plumage, the, underside, of, the, claw, of, the, middle, toe, is, comb, like, with, serrations, their, soft, plumage, is, cryptically, coloured, to, resemble, bark, or, leaves, and, some, species, unusual, for, birds, perch, along, a, branch, rather, than, across, it, helping, to, conceal, them, during, the, day, the, subfamilies, of, nightjars, have, similar, characteristics, including, small, feet, of, little, use, for, walking, and, long, pointed, wings, the, common, poorwill, phalaenoptilus, nuttallii, is, unique, as, a, bird, that, undergoes, a, form, of, hibernation, becoming, torpid, and, with, a, much, reduced, body, temperature, for, weeks, or, months, although, other, nightjars, can, enter, a, state, of, torpor, for, shorter, periods, in, their, pioneering, dna, dna, hybridisation, work, charles, sibley, and, jon, e, ahlquist, found, that, the, genetic, difference, between, the, eared, nightjars, and, the, typical, nightjars, was, in, fact, greater, than, that, between, the, typical, nightjars, and, the, nighthawks, of, the, new, world, accordingly, they, placed, the, eared, nightjars, in, a, separate, family, the, eurostopodidae, 9, known, species, but, the, family, has, not, yet, been, widely, adopted, subsequent, work, both, morphological, and, genetic, has, provided, support, for, the, separation, of, the, typical, and, the, eared, nightjars, and, some, authorities, have, adopted, this, sibley, ahlquist, recommendation, and, also, the, more, far, reaching, one, to, group, all, the, owls, traditionally, strigiformes, together, in, the, caprimulgiformes, the, listing, below, retains, a, more, orthodox, arrangement, but, recognises, the, eared, nightjars, as, a, separate, group, for, more, detail, and, an, alternative, classification, scheme, see, caprimulgiformes, and, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, eurostopodus, lyncornis, gactornis, nyctiprogne, lurocalis, hydropsalis, nyctidromus, nyctipolus, siphonorhis, nyctiphrynus, phalaenoptilus, antrostomus, veles, caprimulgus, podager, chordeiles, also, see, a, list, of, nightjars, sortable, by, common, and, binomial, names, nightjars, inhabit, all, continents, other, than, antarctica, as, well, as, some, island, groups, such, as, madagascar, the, seychelles, new, caledonia, and, the, islands, of, caribbean, they, are, not, known, to, live, in, extremely, arid, desert, regions, nightjars, can, occupy, all, elevations, from, sea, level, to, 4, 200, m, 13, 800, ft, and, a, number, of, species, are, montane, specialists, nightjars, occupy, a, wide, range, of, habitats, from, deserts, to, rainforests, but, are, most, common, in, open, country, with, some, vegetation, the, nighthawks, are, confined, to, the, new, world, and, the, eared, nightjars, to, asia, and, australia, a, number, of, species, undertake, migrations, although, the, secretive, nature, of, the, family, may, account, for, the, incomplete, understanding, of, their, migratory, habits, species, that, live, in, the, far, north, such, as, the, european, nightjar, or, the, common, nighthawk, migrate, southward, with, the, onset, of, winter, geolocators, placed, on, european, nightjars, in, southern, england, found, they, wintered, in, the, south, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, other, species, make, shorter, migrations, some, species, of, nightjars, are, threatened, with, extinction, road, kills, of, this, species, by, cars, are, thought, to, be, a, major, cause, of, mortality, for, many, members, of, the, family, because, of, their, habit, of, resting, and, roosting, on, roads, they, also, usually, nest, on, the, ground, laying, one, or, two, patterned, eggs, directly, onto, bare, ground, nightjars, possibly, move, their, eggs, and, chicks, from, the, nesting, site, in, the, event, of, danger, by, carrying, them, in, their, mouths, this, suggestion, has, been, repeated, many, times, in, ornithology, books, but, surveys, of, nightjar, research, have, found, very, little, evidence, to, support, this, idea, developing, conservation, strategies, for, some, species, presents, a, particular, challenge, in, that, scientists, do, not, have, enough, data, to, determine, whether, or, not, a, species, is, endangered, due, to, the, difficulty, in, locating, identifying, and, or, categorizing, their, limited, number, e, g, 10, 000, known, to, exist, a, good, example, being, the, vaurie, s, nightjar, in, china, s, south, western, xinjiang, province, as, seen, only, once, in, hand, surveys, in, the, 1970s, and, 1990s, failed, to, find, the, species, implying, that, the, species, has, become, extinct, endangered, or, found, only, in, a, few, small, areas
