molecular, biology, m, l, k, j, l, r, is, a, branch, of, biology, that, seeks, to, understand, the, molecular, basis, of, biological, activity, in, and, between, cells, including, biomolecular, synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and, interactions, though, cells, and, other, microscopic, structures, had, been, observed, in, living, organisms, as, early, as, the, 18th, century, a, detailed, understanding, of, the, mechanisms, and, interactions, governing, their, behavior, did, not, emerge, until, the, 20th, century, when, technologies, used, in, physics, and, chemistry, had, advanced, sufficiently, to, permit, their, application, in, the, biological, sciences, the, term, molecular, biology, was, first, used, in, 1945, by, the, english, physicist, william, astbury, who, described, it, as, an, approach, focused, on, discerning, the, underpinnings, of, biological, phenomena, i, e, uncovering, the, physical, and, chemical, structures, and, properties, of, biological, molecules, as, well, as, their, interactions, with, other, molecules, and, how, these, interactions, explain, observations, of, so, called, classical, biology, which, instead, studies, biological, processes, at, larger, scales, and, higher, levels, of, organization, in, 1953, francis, crick, james, watson, rosalind, franklin, and, their, colleagues, at, the, medical, research, council, unit, cavendish, laboratory, were, the, first, to, describe, the, double, helix, model, for, the, chemical, structure, of, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, which, is, often, considered, a, landmark, event, for, the, nascent, field, because, it, provided, a, physico, chemical, basis, by, which, to, understand, the, previously, nebulous, idea, of, nucleic, acids, as, the, primary, substance, of, biological, inheritance, they, proposed, this, structure, based, on, previous, research, done, by, franklin, which, was, conveyed, to, them, by, maurice, wilkins, and, max, perutz, their, work, led, to, the, discovery, of, dna, in, other, microorganisms, plants, and, animals, the, field, of, molecular, biology, includes, techniques, which, enable, scientists, to, learn, about, molecular, processes, these, techniques, are, used, to, efficiently, target, new, drugs, diagnose, disease, and, better, understand, cell, physiology, some, clinical, research, and, medical, therapies, arising, from, molecular, biology, are, covered, under, gene, therapy, whereas, the, use, of, molecular, biology, or, molecular, cell, biology, in, medicine, is, now, referred, to, as, molecular, medicine, molecular, biology, sits, at, the, intersection, of, biochemistry, and, genetics, as, these, scientific, disciplines, emerged, and, evolved, in, the, 20th, century, it, became, clear, that, they, both, sought, to, determine, the, molecular, mechanisms, which, underlie, vital, cellular, functions, advances, in, molecular, biology, have, been, closely, related, to, the, development, of, new, technologies, and, their, optimization, molecular, biology, has, been, elucidated, by, the, work, of, many, scientists, and, thus, the, history, of, the, field, depends, on, an, understanding, of, these, scientists, and, their, experiments, the, field, of, genetics, arose, from, attempts, to, understand, the, set, of, rules, underlying, reproduction, and, heredity, and, the, nature, of, the, hypothetical, units, of, heredity, known, as, genes, gregor, mendel, pioneered, this, work, in, 1866, when, he, first, described, the, laws, of, inheritance, he, observed, in, his, studies, of, mating, crosses, in, pea, plants, one, such, law, of, genetic, inheritance, is, the, law, of, segregation, which, states, that, diploid, individuals, with, two, alleles, for, a, particular, gene, will, pass, one, of, these, alleles, to, their, offspring, because, of, his, critical, work, the, study, of, genetic, inheritance, is, commonly, referred, to, as, mendelian, genetics, a, major, milestone, in, molecular, biology, was, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, this, work, began, in, 1869, by, friedrich, miescher, a, swiss, biochemist, who, first, proposed, a, structure, called, nuclein, which, we, now, know, to, be, deoxyribonucleic, acid, or, dna, he, discovered, this, unique, substance, by, studying, the, components, of, pus, filled, bandages, and, noting, the, unique, properties, of, the, phosphorus, containing, substances, another, notable, contributor, to, the, dna, model, was, phoebus, levene, who, proposed, the, polynucleotide, model, of, dna, in, 1919, as, a, result, of, his, biochemical, experiments, on, yeast, in, 1950, erwin, chargaff, expanded, on, the, work, of, levene, and, elucidated, a, few, critical, properties, of, nucleic, acids, first, the, sequence, of, nucleic, acids, varies, across, species, second, the, total, concentration, of, purines, adenine, and, guanine, is, always, equal, to, the, total, concentration, of, pyrimidines, cysteine, and, thymine, this, is, now, known, as, chargaff, s, rule, in, 1953, james, watson, and, francis, crick, published, the, double, helical, structure, of, dna, based, on, the, x, ray, crystallography, work, done, by, rosalind, franklin, which, was, conveyed, to, them, by, maurice, wilkins, and, max, perutz, watson, and, crick, described, the, structure, of, dna, and, conjectured, about, the, implications, of, this, unique, structure, for, possible, mechanisms, of, dna, replication, watson, and, crick, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1962, along, with, wilkins, for, proposing, a, model, of, the, structure, of, dna, in, 1961, it, was, demonstrated, that, when, a, gene, encodes, a, protein, three, sequential, bases, of, a, gene, s, dna, specify, each, successive, amino, acid, of, the, protein, thus, the, genetic, code, is, a, triplet, code, where, each, triplet, called, a, codon, specifies, a, particular, amino, acid, furthermore, it, was, shown, that, the, codons, do, not, overlap, with, each, other, in, the, dna, sequence, encoding, a, protein, and, that, each, sequence, is, read, from, a, fixed, starting, point, during, 1962, 1964, through, the, use, of, conditional, lethal, mutants, of, a, bacterial, virus, fundamental, advances, were, made, in, our, understanding, of, the, functions, and, interactions, of, the, proteins, employed, in, the, machinery, of, dna, replication, dna, repair, dna, recombination, and, in, the, assembly, of, molecular, structures, in, 1928, frederick, griffith, encountered, a, virulence, property, in, pneumococcus, bacteria, which, was, killing, lab, rats, according, to, mendel, prevalent, at, that, time, gene, transfer, could, occur, only, from, parent, to, daughter, cells, griffith, advanced, another, theory, stating, that, gene, transfer, occurring, in, member, of, same, generation, is, known, as, horizontal, gene, transfer, hgt, this, phenomenon, is, now, referred, to, as, genetic, transformation, griffith, s, experiment, addressed, the, pneumococcus, bacteria, which, had, two, different, strains, one, virulent, and, smooth, and, one, avirulent, and, rough, the, smooth, strain, had, glistering, appearance, owing, to, the, presence, of, a, type, of, specific, polysaccharide, a, polymer, of, glucose, and, glucuronic, acid, capsule, due, to, this, polysaccharide, layer, of, bacteria, a, host, s, immune, system, cannot, recognize, the, bacteria, and, it, kills, the, host, the, other, avirulent, rough, strain, lacks, this, polysaccharide, capsule, and, has, a, dull, rough, appearance, presence, or, absence, of, capsule, in, the, strain, is, known, to, be, genetically, determined, smooth, and, rough, strains, occur, in, several, different, type, such, as, s, i, s, ii, s, iii, etc, and, r, i, r, ii, r, iii, etc, respectively, all, this, subtypes, of, s, and, r, bacteria, differ, with, each, other, in, antigen, type, they, produce, the, avery, macleod, mccarty, experiment, was, a, landmark, study, conducted, in, 1944, that, demonstrated, that, dna, not, protein, as, previously, thought, carries, genetic, information, in, bacteria, oswald, avery, colin, munro, macleod, and, maclyn, mccarty, used, an, extract, from, a, strain, of, pneumococcus, that, could, cause, pneumonia, in, mice, they, showed, that, genetic, transformation, in, the, bacteria, could, be, accomplished, by, injecting, them, with, purified, dna, from, the, extract, they, discovered, that, when, they, digested, the, dna, in, the, extract, with, dnase, transformation, of, harmless, bacteria, into, virulent, ones, was, lost, this, provided, strong, evidence, that, dna, was, the, genetic, material, challenging, the, prevailing, belief, that, proteins, were, responsible, it, laid, the, basis, for, the, subsequent, discovery, of, its, structure, by, watson, and, crick, confirmation, that, dna, is, the, genetic, material, which, is, cause, of, infection, came, from, the, hershey, chase, experiment, they, used, e, coli, and, bacteriophage, for, the, experiment, this, experiment, is, also, known, as, blender, experiment, as, kitchen, blender, was, used, as, a, major, piece, of, apparatus, alfred, hershey, and, martha, chase, demonstrated, that, the, dna, injected, by, a, phage, particle, into, a, bacterium, contains, all, information, required, to, synthesize, progeny, phage, particles, they, used, radioactivity, to, tag, the, bacteriophage, s, protein, coat, with, radioactive, sulphur, and, dna, with, radioactive, phosphorus, into, two, different, test, tubes, respectively, after, mixing, bacteriophage, and, e, coli, into, the, test, tube, the, incubation, period, starts, in, which, phage, transforms, the, genetic, material, in, the, e, coli, cells, then, the, mixture, is, blended, or, agitated, which, separates, the, phage, from, e, coli, cells, the, whole, mixture, is, centrifuged, and, the, pellet, which, contains, e, coli, cells, was, checked, and, the, supernatant, was, discarded, the, e, coli, cells, showed, radioactive, phosphorus, which, indicated, that, the, transformed, material, was, dna, not, the, protein, coat, the, transformed, dna, gets, attached, to, the, dna, of, e, coli, and, radioactivity, is, only, seen, onto, the, bacteriophage, s, dna, this, mutated, dna, can, be, passed, to, the, next, generation, and, the, theory, of, transduction, came, into, existence, transduction, is, a, process, in, which, the, bacterial, dna, carry, the, fragment, of, bacteriophages, and, pass, it, on, the, next, generation, this, is, also, a, type, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, the, meselson, stahl, experiment, was, a, landmark, experiment, in, molecular, biology, that, provided, evidence, for, the, semiconservative, replication, of, dna, conducted, in, 1958, by, matthew, meselson, and, franklin, stahl, the, experiment, involved, growing, e, coli, bacteria, in, a, medium, containing, heavy, isotope, of, nitrogen, 15, n, for, several, generations, this, caused, all, the, newly, synthesized, bacterial, dna, to, be, incorporated, with, the, heavy, isotope, after, allowing, the, bacteria, to, replicate, in, a, medium, containing, normal, nitrogen, 14, n, samples, were, taken, at, various, time, points, these, samples, were, then, subjected, to, centrifugation, in, a, density, gradient, which, separated, the, dna, molecules, based, on, their, density, the, results, showed, that, after, one, generation, of, replication, in, the, 14, n, medium, the, dna, formed, a, band, of, intermediate, density, between, that, of, pure, 15, n, dna, and, pure, 14, n, dna, this, supported, the, semiconservative, dna, replication, proposed, by, watson, and, crick, where, each, strand, of, the, parental, dna, molecule, serves, as, a, template, for, the, synthesis, of, a, new, complementary, strand, resulting, in, two, daughter, dna, molecules, each, consisting, of, one, parental, and, one, newly, synthesized, strand, the, meselson, stahl, experiment, provided, compelling, evidence, for, the, semiconservative, replication, of, dna, which, is, fundamental, to, the, understanding, of, genetics, and, molecular, biology, in, the, early, 2020s, molecular, biology, entered, a, golden, age, defined, by, both, vertical, and, horizontal, technical, development, vertically, novel, technologies, are, allowing, for, real, time, monitoring, of, biological, processes, at, the, atomic, level, molecular, biologists, today, have, access, to, increasingly, affordable, sequencing, data, at, increasingly, higher, depths, facilitating, the, development, of, novel, genetic, manipulation, methods, in, new, non, model, organisms, likewise, synthetic, molecular, biologists, will, drive, the, industrial, production, of, small, and, macro, molecules, through, the, introduction, of, exogenous, metabolic, pathways, in, various, prokaryotic, and, eukaryotic, cell, lines, horizontally, sequencing, data, is, becoming, more, affordable, and, used, in, many, different, scientific, fields, this, will, drive, the, development, of, industries, in, developing, nations, and, increase, accessibility, to, individual, researchers, likewise, crispr, cas9, gene, editing, experiments, can, now, be, conceived, and, implemented, by, individuals, for, under, 10, 000, in, novel, organisms, which, will, drive, the, development, of, industrial, and, medical, applications, the, following, list, describes, a, viewpoint, on, the, interdisciplinary, relationships, between, molecular, biology, and, other, related, fields, while, researchers, practice, techniques, specific, to, molecular, biology, it, is, common, to, combine, these, with, methods, from, genetics, and, biochemistry, much, of, molecular, biology, is, quantitative, and, recently, a, significant, amount, of, work, has, been, done, using, computer, science, techniques, such, as, bioinformatics, and, computational, biology, molecular, genetics, the, study, of, gene, structure, and, function, has, been, among, the, most, prominent, sub, fields, of, molecular, biology, since, the, early, 2000s, other, branches, of, biology, are, informed, by, molecular, biology, by, either, directly, studying, the, interactions, of, molecules, in, their, own, right, such, as, in, cell, biology, and, developmental, biology, or, indirectly, where, molecular, techniques, are, used, to, infer, historical, attributes, of, populations, or, species, as, in, fields, in, evolutionary, biology, such, as, population, genetics, and, phylogenetics, there, is, also, a, long, tradition, of, studying, biomolecules, from, the, ground, up, or, molecularly, in, biophysics, molecular, cloning, is, used, to, isolate, and, then, transfer, a, dna, sequence, of, interest, into, a, plasmid, vector, this, recombinant, dna, technology, was, first, developed, in, the, 1960s, in, this, technique, a, dna, sequence, coding, for, a, protein, of, interest, is, cloned, using, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, and, or, restriction, enzymes, into, a, plasmid, expression, vector, the, plasmid, vector, usually, has, at, least, 3, distinctive, features, an, origin, of, replication, a, multiple, cloning, site, mcs, and, a, selective, marker, usually, antibiotic, resistance, additionally, upstream, of, the, mcs, are, the, promoter, regions, and, the, transcription, start, site, which, regulate, the, expression, of, cloned, gene, this, plasmid, can, be, inserted, into, either, bacterial, or, animal, cells, introducing, dna, into, bacterial, cells, can, be, done, by, transformation, via, uptake, of, naked, dna, conjugation, via, cell, cell, contact, or, by, transduction, via, viral, vector, introducing, dna, into, eukaryotic, cells, such, as, animal, cells, by, physical, or, chemical, means, is, called, transfection, several, different, transfection, techniques, are, available, such, as, calcium, phosphate, transfection, electroporation, microinjection, and, liposome, transfection, the, plasmid, may, be, integrated, into, the, genome, resulting, in, a, stable, transfection, or, may, remain, independent, of, the, genome, and, expressed, temporarily, called, a, transient, transfection, dna, coding, for, a, protein, of, interest, is, now, inside, a, cell, and, the, protein, can, now, be, expressed, a, variety, of, systems, such, as, inducible, promoters, and, specific, cell, signaling, factors, are, available, to, help, express, the, protein, of, interest, at, high, levels, large, quantities, of, a, protein, can, then, be, extracted, from, the, bacterial, or, eukaryotic, cell, the, protein, can, be, tested, for, enzymatic, activity, under, a, variety, of, situations, the, protein, may, be, crystallized, so, its, tertiary, structure, can, be, studied, or, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, the, activity, of, new, drugs, against, the, protein, can, be, studied, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, is, an, extremely, versatile, technique, for, copying, dna, in, brief, pcr, allows, a, specific, dna, sequence, to, be, copied, or, modified, in, predetermined, ways, the, reaction, is, extremely, powerful, and, under, perfect, conditions, could, amplify, one, dna, molecule, to, become, 1, 07, billion, molecules, in, less, than, two, hours, pcr, has, many, applications, including, the, study, of, gene, expression, the, detection, of, pathogenic, microorganisms, the, detection, of, genetic, mutations, and, the, introduction, of, mutations, to, dna, the, pcr, technique, can, be, used, to, introduce, restriction, enzyme, sites, to, ends, of, dna, molecules, or, to, mutate, particular, bases, of, dna, the, latter, is, a, method, referred, to, as, site, directed, mutagenesis, pcr, can, also, be, used, to, determine, whether, a, particular, dna, fragment, is, found, in, a, cdna, library, pcr, has, many, variations, like, reverse, transcription, pcr, rt, pcr, for, amplification, of, rna, and, more, recently, quantitative, pcr, which, allow, for, quantitative, measurement, of, dna, or, rna, molecules, gel, electrophoresis, is, a, technique, which, separates, molecules, by, their, size, using, an, agarose, or, polyacrylamide, gel, this, technique, is, one, of, the, principal, tools, of, molecular, biology, the, basic, principle, is, that, dna, fragments, can, be, separated, by, applying, an, electric, current, across, the, gel, because, the, dna, backbone, contains, negatively, charged, phosphate, groups, the, dna, will, migrate, through, the, agarose, gel, towards, the, positive, end, of, the, current, proteins, can, also, be, separated, on, the, basis, of, size, using, an, sds, page, gel, or, on, the, basis, of, size, and, their, electric, charge, by, using, what, is, known, as, a, 2d, gel, electrophoresis, the, bradford, assay, is, a, molecular, biology, technique, which, enables, the, fast, accurate, quantitation, of, protein, molecules, utilizing, the, unique, properties, of, a, dye, called, coomassie, brilliant, blue, g, 250, coomassie, blue, undergoes, a, visible, color, shift, from, reddish, brown, to, bright, blue, upon, binding, to, protein, in, its, unstable, cationic, state, coomassie, blue, has, a, background, wavelength, of, 465, nm, and, gives, off, a, reddish, brown, color, when, coomassie, blue, binds, to, protein, in, an, acidic, solution, the, background, wavelength, shifts, to, 595, nm, and, the, dye, gives, off, a, bright, blue, color, proteins, in, the, assay, bind, coomassie, blue, in, about, 2, minutes, and, the, protein, dye, complex, is, stable, for, about, an, hour, although, it, is, recommended, that, absorbance, readings, are, taken, within, 5, to, 20, minutes, of, reaction, initiation, the, concentration, of, protein, in, the, bradford, assay, can, then, be, measured, using, a, visible, light, spectrophotometer, and, therefore, does, not, require, extensive, equipment, this, method, was, developed, in, 1975, by, marion, m, bradford, and, has, enabled, significantly, faster, more, accurate, protein, quantitation, compared, to, previous, methods, the, lowry, procedure, and, the, biuret, assay, unlike, the, previous, methods, the, bradford, assay, is, not, susceptible, to, interference, by, several, non, protein, molecules, including, ethanol, sodium, chloride, and, magnesium, chloride, however, it, is, susceptible, to, influence, by, strong, alkaline, buffering, agents, such, as, sodium, dodecyl, sulfate, sds, the, terms, northern, western, and, eastern, blotting, are, derived, from, what, initially, was, a, molecular, biology, joke, that, played, on, the, term, southern, blotting, after, the, technique, described, by, edwin, southern, for, the, hybridisation, of, blotted, dna, patricia, thomas, developer, of, the, rna, blot, which, then, became, known, as, the, northern, blot, actually, did, not, use, the, term, named, after, its, inventor, biologist, edwin, southern, the, southern, blot, is, a, method, for, probing, for, the, presence, of, a, specific, dna, sequence, within, a, dna, sample, dna, samples, before, or, after, restriction, enzyme, restriction, endonuclease, digestion, are, separated, by, gel, electrophoresis, and, then, transferred, to, a, membrane, by, blotting, via, capillary, action, the, membrane, is, then, exposed, to, a, labeled, dna, probe, that, has, a, complement, base, sequence, to, the, sequence, on, the, dna, of, interest, southern, blotting, is, less, commonly, used, in, laboratory, science, due, to, the, capacity, of, other, techniques, such, as, pcr, to, detect, specific, dna, sequences, from, dna, samples, these, blots, are, still, used, for, some, applications, however, such, as, measuring, transgene, copy, number, in, transgenic, mice, or, in, the, engineering, of, gene, knockout, embryonic, stem, cell, lines, the, northern, blot, is, used, to, study, the, presence, of, specific, rna, molecules, as, relative, comparison, among, a, set, of, different, samples, of, rna, it, is, essentially, a, combination, of, denaturing, rna, gel, electrophoresis, and, a, blot, in, this, process, rna, is, separated, based, on, size, and, is, then, transferred, to, a, membrane, that, is, then, probed, with, a, labeled, complement, of, a, sequence, of, interest, the, results, may, be, visualized, through, a, variety, of, ways, depending, on, the, label, used, however, most, result, in, the, revelation, of, bands, representing, the, sizes, of, the, rna, detected, in, sample, the, intensity, of, these, bands, is, related, to, the, amount, of, the, target, rna, in, the, samples, analyzed, the, procedure, is, commonly, used, to, study, when, and, how, much, gene, expression, is, occurring, by, measuring, how, much, of, that, rna, is, present, in, different, samples, assuming, that, no, post, transcriptional, regulation, occurs, and, that, the, levels, of, mrna, reflect, proportional, levels, of, the, corresponding, protein, being, produced, it, is, one, of, the, most, basic, tools, for, determining, at, what, time, and, under, what, conditions, certain, genes, are, expressed, in, living, tissues, a, western, blot, is, a, technique, by, which, specific, proteins, can, be, detected, from, a, mixture, of, proteins, western, blots, can, be, used, to, determine, the, size, of, isolated, proteins, as, well, as, to, quantify, their, expression, in, western, blotting, proteins, are, first, separated, by, size, in, a, thin, gel, sandwiched, between, two, glass, plates, in, a, technique, known, as, sds, page, the, proteins, in, the, gel, are, then, transferred, to, a, polyvinylidene, fluoride, pvdf, nitrocellulose, nylon, or, other, support, membrane, this, membrane, can, then, be, probed, with, solutions, of, antibodies, antibodies, that, specifically, bind, to, the, protein, of, interest, can, then, be, visualized, by, a, variety, of, techniques, including, colored, products, chemiluminescence, or, autoradiography, often, the, antibodies, are, labeled, with, enzymes, when, a, chemiluminescent, substrate, is, exposed, to, the, enzyme, it, allows, detection, using, western, blotting, techniques, allows, not, only, detection, but, also, quantitative, analysis, analogous, methods, to, western, blotting, can, be, used, to, directly, stain, specific, proteins, in, live, cells, or, tissue, sections, the, eastern, blotting, technique, is, used, to, detect, post, translational, modification, of, proteins, proteins, blotted, on, to, the, pvdf, or, nitrocellulose, membrane, are, probed, for, modifications, using, specific, substrates, a, dna, microarray, is, a, collection, of, spots, attached, to, a, solid, support, such, as, a, microscope, slide, where, each, spot, contains, one, or, more, single, stranded, dna, oligonucleotide, fragments, arrays, make, it, possible, to, put, down, large, quantities, of, very, small, 100, micrometre, diameter, spots, on, a, single, slide, each, spot, has, a, dna, fragment, molecule, that, is, complementary, to, a, single, dna, sequence, a, variation, of, this, technique, allows, the, gene, expression, of, an, organism, at, a, particular, stage, in, development, to, be, qualified, expression, profiling, in, this, technique, the, rna, in, a, tissue, is, isolated, and, converted, to, labeled, complementary, dna, cdna, this, cdna, is, then, hybridized, to, the, fragments, on, the, array, and, visualization, of, the, hybridization, can, be, done, since, multiple, arrays, can, be, made, with, exactly, the, same, position, of, fragments, they, are, particularly, useful, for, comparing, the, gene, expression, of, two, different, tissues, such, as, a, healthy, and, cancerous, tissue, also, one, can, measure, what, genes, are, expressed, and, how, that, expression, changes, with, time, or, with, other, factors, there, are, many, different, ways, to, fabricate, microarrays, the, most, common, are, silicon, chips, microscope, slides, with, spots, of, 100, micrometre, diameter, custom, arrays, and, arrays, with, larger, spots, on, porous, membranes, macroarrays, there, can, be, anywhere, from, 100, spots, to, more, than, 10, 000, on, a, given, array, arrays, can, also, be, made, with, molecules, other, than, dna, allele, specific, oligonucleotide, aso, is, a, technique, that, allows, detection, of, single, base, mutations, without, the, need, for, pcr, or, gel, electrophoresis, short, 20, 25, nucleotides, in, length, labeled, probes, are, exposed, to, the, non, fragmented, target, dna, hybridization, occurs, with, high, specificity, due, to, the, short, length, of, the, probes, and, even, a, single, base, change, will, hinder, hybridization, the, target, dna, is, then, washed, and, the, unhybridized, probes, are, removed, the, target, dna, is, then, analyzed, for, the, presence, of, the, probe, via, radioactivity, or, fluorescence, in, this, experiment, as, in, most, molecular, biology, techniques, a, control, must, be, used, to, ensure, successful, experimentation, in, molecular, biology, procedures, and, technologies, are, continually, being, developed, and, older, technologies, abandoned, for, example, before, the, advent, of, dna, gel, electrophoresis, agarose, or, polyacrylamide, the, size, of, dna, molecules, was, typically, determined, by, rate, sedimentation, in, sucrose, gradients, a, slow, and, labor, intensive, technique, requiring, expensive, instrumentation, prior, to, sucrose, gradients, viscometry, was, used, aside, from, their, historical, interest, it, is, often, worth, knowing, about, older, technology, as, it, is, occasionally, useful, to, solve, another, new, problem, for, which, the, newer, technique, is, inappropriate
