https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination
a, hallucination, is, a, perception, in, the, absence, of, an, external, stimulus, that, has, the, compelling, sense, of, reality, hallucination, is, a, combination, of, two, conscious, states, of, brain, wakefulness, and, rem, sleep, they, are, distinguishable, from, several, related, phenomena, such, as, dreaming, rem, sleep, which, does, not, involve, wakefulness, pseudohallucination, which, does, not, mimic, real, perception, and, is, accurately, perceived, as, unreal, illusion, which, involves, distorted, or, misinterpreted, real, perception, and, mental, imagery, which, does, not, mimic, real, perception, and, is, under, voluntary, control, hallucinations, also, differ, from, delusional, perceptions, in, which, a, correctly, sensed, and, interpreted, stimulus, i, e, a, real, perception, is, given, some, additional, significance, hallucinations, can, occur, in, any, sensory, modality, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, proprioceptive, equilibrioceptive, nociceptive, thermoceptive, and, chronoceptive, hallucinations, are, referred, to, as, multimodal, if, multiple, sensory, modalities, occur, a, mild, form, of, hallucination, is, known, as, a, disturbance, and, can, occur, in, most, of, the, senses, above, these, may, be, things, like, seeing, movement, in, peripheral, vision, or, hearing, faint, noises, or, voices, auditory, hallucinations, are, very, common, in, schizophrenia, they, may, be, benevolent, telling, the, subject, good, things, about, themselves, or, malicious, cursing, the, subject, 55, of, auditory, hallucinations, are, malicious, in, content, for, example, people, talking, about, the, subject, not, speaking, to, them, directly, like, auditory, hallucinations, the, source, of, the, visual, counterpart, can, also, be, behind, the, subject, this, can, produce, a, feeling, of, being, looked, or, stared, at, usually, with, malicious, intent, frequently, auditory, hallucinations, and, their, visual, counterpart, are, experienced, by, the, subject, together, hypnagogic, hallucinations, and, hypnopompic, hallucinations, are, considered, normal, phenomena, hypnagogic, hallucinations, can, occur, as, one, is, falling, asleep, and, hypnopompic, hallucinations, occur, when, one, is, waking, up, hallucinations, can, be, associated, with, drug, use, particularly, deliriants, sleep, deprivation, psychosis, neurological, disorders, and, delirium, tremens, many, hallucinations, happen, also, during, sleep, paralysis, the, word, hallucination, itself, was, introduced, into, the, english, language, by, the, 17th, century, physician, sir, thomas, browne, in, 1646, from, the, derivation, of, the, latin, word, alucinari, meaning, to, wander, in, the, mind, for, browne, hallucination, means, a, sort, of, vision, that, is, depraved, and, receive, its, objects, erroneously, hallucinations, may, be, manifested, in, a, variety, of, forms, various, forms, of, hallucinations, affect, different, senses, sometimes, occurring, simultaneously, creating, multiple, sensory, hallucinations, for, those, experiencing, them, auditory, hallucinations, also, known, as, paracusia, are, the, perception, of, sound, without, outside, stimulus, auditory, hallucinations, can, be, divided, into, elementary, and, complex, along, with, verbal, and, nonverbal, these, hallucinations, are, the, most, common, type, of, hallucination, with, auditory, verbal, hallucinations, being, more, common, than, nonverbal, elementary, hallucinations, are, the, perception, of, sounds, such, as, hissing, whistling, an, extended, tone, and, more, in, many, cases, tinnitus, is, an, elementary, auditory, hallucination, however, some, people, who, experience, certain, types, of, tinnitus, especially, pulsatile, tinnitus, are, actually, hearing, the, blood, rushing, through, vessels, near, the, ear, because, the, auditory, stimulus, is, present, in, this, situation, it, does, not, qualify, it, as, a, hallucination, complex, hallucinations, are, those, of, voices, music, or, other, sounds, that, may, or, may, not, be, clear, may, or, may, not, be, familiar, and, may, be, friendly, aggressive, or, among, other, possibilities, a, hallucination, of, a, single, individual, person, of, one, or, more, talking, voices, is, particularly, associated, with, psychotic, disorders, such, as, schizophrenia, and, hold, special, significance, in, diagnosing, these, conditions, in, schizophrenia, voices, are, normally, perceived, coming, from, outside, the, person, but, in, dissociative, disorders, they, are, perceived, as, originating, from, within, the, person, commenting, in, their, head, instead, of, behind, their, back, differential, diagnosis, between, schizophrenia, and, dissociative, disorders, is, challenging, due, to, many, overlapping, symptoms, especially, schneiderian, first, rank, symptoms, such, as, hallucinations, however, many, people, who, do, not, have, a, diagnosable, mental, illness, may, sometimes, hear, voices, as, well, one, important, example, to, consider, when, forming, a, differential, diagnosis, for, a, patient, with, paracusia, is, lateral, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, despite, the, tendency, to, associate, hearing, voices, or, otherwise, hallucinating, and, psychosis, with, schizophrenia, or, other, psychiatric, illnesses, it, is, crucial, to, take, into, consideration, that, even, if, a, person, does, exhibit, psychotic, features, they, do, not, necessarily, have, a, psychiatric, disorder, on, its, own, disorders, such, as, wilson, s, disease, various, endocrine, diseases, numerous, metabolic, disturbances, multiple, sclerosis, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, porphyria, sarcoidosis, and, many, others, can, present, with, psychosis, musical, hallucinations, are, also, relatively, common, in, terms, of, complex, auditory, hallucinations, and, may, be, the, result, of, a, wide, range, of, causes, ranging, from, hearing, loss, such, as, in, musical, ear, syndrome, the, auditory, version, of, charles, bonnet, syndrome, lateral, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, arteriovenous, malformation, stroke, lesion, abscess, or, tumor, the, hearing, voices, movement, is, a, support, and, advocacy, group, for, people, who, hallucinate, voices, but, do, not, otherwise, show, signs, of, mental, illness, or, impairment, high, caffeine, consumption, has, been, linked, to, an, increase, in, likelihood, of, one, experiencing, auditory, hallucinations, a, study, conducted, by, the, la, trobe, university, school, of, psychological, sciences, revealed, that, as, few, as, five, cups, of, coffee, a, day, approximately, 500, mg, of, caffeine, could, trigger, the, phenomenon, a, visual, hallucination, is, the, perception, of, an, external, visual, stimulus, where, none, exists, a, separate, but, related, phenomenon, is, a, visual, illusion, which, is, a, distortion, of, a, real, external, stimulus, visual, hallucinations, are, classified, as, simple, or, complex, for, example, one, may, report, hallucinating, a, giraffe, a, simple, visual, hallucination, is, an, amorphous, figure, that, may, have, a, similar, shape, or, color, to, a, giraffe, looks, like, a, giraffe, while, a, complex, visual, hallucination, is, a, discrete, lifelike, image, that, is, unmistakably, a, giraffe, command, hallucinations, are, hallucinations, in, the, form, of, commands, they, appear, to, be, from, an, external, source, or, can, appear, coming, from, the, subject, s, head, the, contents, of, the, hallucinations, can, range, from, the, innocuous, to, commands, to, cause, harm, to, the, self, or, others, command, hallucinations, are, often, associated, with, schizophrenia, people, experiencing, command, hallucinations, may, or, may, not, comply, with, the, hallucinated, commands, depending, on, the, circumstances, compliance, is, more, common, for, non, violent, commands, command, hallucinations, are, sometimes, used, to, defend, a, crime, that, has, been, committed, often, homicides, in, essence, it, is, a, voice, that, one, hears, and, it, tells, the, listener, what, to, do, sometimes, the, commands, are, quite, benign, directives, such, as, stand, up, or, shut, the, door, whether, it, is, a, command, for, something, simple, or, something, that, is, a, threat, it, is, still, considered, a, command, hallucination, some, helpful, questions, that, can, assist, one, in, determining, if, they, may, have, this, includes, what, are, the, voices, telling, you, to, do, when, did, your, voices, first, start, telling, you, to, do, things, do, you, recognize, the, person, who, is, telling, you, to, harm, yourself, or, others, do, you, think, you, can, resist, doing, what, the, voices, are, telling, you, to, do, phantosmia, olfactory, hallucinations, smelling, an, odor, that, is, not, actually, there, and, parosmia, olfactory, illusions, inhaling, a, real, odor, but, perceiving, it, as, different, scent, than, remembered, are, distortions, to, the, sense, of, smell, olfactory, system, and, in, most, cases, are, not, caused, by, anything, serious, and, will, usually, go, away, on, their, own, in, time, it, can, result, from, a, range, of, conditions, such, as, nasal, infections, nasal, polyps, dental, problems, migraines, head, injuries, seizures, strokes, or, brain, tumors, environmental, exposures, can, sometimes, cause, it, as, well, such, as, smoking, exposure, to, certain, types, of, chemicals, e, g, insecticides, or, solvents, or, radiation, treatment, for, head, or, neck, cancer, it, can, also, be, a, symptom, of, certain, mental, disorders, such, as, depression, bipolar, disorder, intoxication, substance, withdrawal, or, psychotic, disorders, e, g, schizophrenia, the, perceived, odors, are, usually, unpleasant, and, commonly, described, as, smelling, burned, foul, spoiled, or, rotten, tactile, hallucinations, are, the, illusion, of, tactile, sensory, input, simulating, various, types, of, pressure, to, the, skin, or, other, organs, one, subtype, of, tactile, hallucination, formication, is, the, sensation, of, insects, crawling, underneath, the, skin, and, is, frequently, associated, with, prolonged, cocaine, use, however, formication, may, also, be, the, result, of, normal, hormonal, changes, such, as, menopause, or, disorders, such, as, peripheral, neuropathy, high, fevers, lyme, disease, skin, cancer, and, more, this, type, of, hallucination, is, the, perception, of, taste, without, a, stimulus, these, hallucinations, which, are, typically, strange, or, unpleasant, are, relatively, common, among, individuals, who, have, certain, types, of, focal, epilepsy, especially, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, the, regions, of, the, brain, responsible, for, gustatory, hallucination, in, this, case, are, the, insula, and, the, superior, bank, of, the, sylvian, fissure, sexual, hallucinations, are, the, perception, of, erogenous, or, orgasmic, stimuli, they, may, be, unimodal, or, multimodal, in, nature, and, frequently, involve, sensation, in, the, genital, region, though, it, is, not, exclusive, frequent, examples, of, sexual, hallucinations, include, the, sensation, of, being, penetrated, experiencing, orgasm, feeling, as, if, one, is, being, touched, in, an, erogenous, zone, sensing, stimulation, in, the, genitals, feeling, the, fondling, of, one, s, breasts, or, buttocks, and, tastes, or, smells, related, to, sexual, activity, visualizations, of, sexual, content, and, auditory, voices, making, sexually, explicit, remarks, may, sometimes, be, included, in, this, classification, while, it, features, components, of, other, classifications, sexual, hallucinations, are, distinct, due, to, the, orgasmic, component, and, unique, presentation, the, regions, of, the, brain, responsible, differ, by, the, subsection, of, sexual, hallucination, in, orgasmic, auras, the, mesial, temporal, lobe, right, amygdala, and, hippocampus, are, involved, in, males, genital, specific, sensations, are, related, to, the, postcentral, gyrus, and, arousal, and, ejaculation, are, linked, to, stimulation, in, the, posterior, frontal, lobe, in, females, however, the, hippocampus, and, amygdala, are, connected, limited, studies, have, been, done, to, understand, the, mechanism, of, action, behind, sexual, hallucinations, in, epilepsy, substance, use, and, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, etiologies, somatic, hallucinations, refer, to, an, interoceptive, sensory, experience, in, the, absence, of, stimulus, somatic, hallucinations, can, be, broken, down, into, further, subcategories, general, algesic, kinesthetic, and, cenesthopathic, a, hallucination, involving, sensory, modalities, is, called, multimodal, analogous, to, unimodal, hallucinations, which, have, only, one, sensory, modality, the, multiple, sensory, modalities, can, occur, at, the, same, time, simultaneously, or, with, a, delay, serial, be, related, or, unrelated, to, each, other, and, be, consistent, with, reality, congruent, or, not, incongruent, for, example, a, person, talking, in, a, hallucination, would, be, congruent, with, reality, but, a, cat, talking, would, not, be, multimodal, hallucinations, are, correlated, to, poorer, mental, health, outcomes, and, are, often, experienced, as, feeling, more, real, hallucinations, can, be, caused, by, a, number, of, factors, these, hallucinations, occur, just, before, falling, asleep, and, affect, a, high, proportion, of, the, population, in, one, survey, 37, of, the, respondents, experienced, them, twice, a, week, the, hallucinations, can, last, from, seconds, to, minutes, all, the, while, the, subject, usually, remains, aware, of, the, true, nature, of, the, images, these, may, be, associated, with, narcolepsy, hypnagogic, hallucinations, are, sometimes, associated, with, brainstem, abnormalities, but, this, is, rare, peduncular, means, pertaining, to, the, peduncle, which, is, a, neural, tract, running, to, and, from, the, pons, on, the, brain, stem, these, hallucinations, usually, occur, in, the, evenings, but, not, during, drowsiness, as, in, the, case, of, hypnagogic, hallucination, the, subject, is, usually, fully, conscious, and, then, can, interact, with, the, hallucinatory, characters, for, extended, periods, of, time, as, in, the, case, of, hypnagogic, hallucinations, insight, into, the, nature, of, the, images, remains, intact, the, false, images, can, occur, in, any, part, of, the, visual, field, and, are, rarely, polymodal, one, of, the, more, enigmatic, forms, of, visual, hallucination, is, the, highly, variable, possibly, polymodal, delirium, tremens, it, is, associated, with, withdrawal, in, alcohol, use, disorder, individuals, with, delirium, tremens, may, be, agitated, and, confused, especially, in, the, later, stages, of, this, disease, insight, is, gradually, reduced, with, the, progression, of, this, disorder, sleep, is, disturbed, and, occurs, for, a, shorter, period, of, time, with, rapid, eye, movement, sleep, parkinson, s, disease, is, linked, with, lewy, body, dementia, for, their, similar, hallucinatory, symptoms, presence, hallucinations, can, be, an, early, indicator, of, cognitive, decline, in, parkinson, s, disease, the, symptoms, strike, during, the, evening, in, any, part, of, the, visual, field, and, are, rarely, polymodal, the, segue, into, hallucination, may, begin, with, illusions, where, sensory, perception, is, greatly, distorted, but, no, novel, sensory, information, is, present, these, typically, last, for, several, minutes, during, which, time, the, subject, may, be, either, conscious, and, normal, or, drowsy, inaccessible, insight, into, these, hallucinations, is, usually, preserved, and, rem, sleep, is, usually, reduced, parkinson, s, disease, is, usually, associated, with, a, degraded, substantia, nigra, pars, compacta, but, recent, evidence, suggests, that, pd, affects, a, number, of, sites, in, the, brain, some, places, of, noted, degradation, include, the, median, raphe, nuclei, the, noradrenergic, parts, of, the, locus, coeruleus, and, the, cholinergic, neurons, in, the, parabrachial, area, and, pedunculopontine, nuclei, of, the, tegmentum, this, type, of, hallucination, is, usually, experienced, during, the, recovery, from, a, comatose, state, the, migraine, coma, can, last, for, up, to, two, days, and, a, state, of, depression, is, sometimes, comorbid, the, hallucinations, occur, during, states, of, full, consciousness, and, insight, into, the, hallucinatory, nature, of, the, images, is, preserved, it, has, been, noted, that, ataxic, lesions, accompany, the, migraine, coma, migraine, attacks, may, result, in, visual, hallucinations, including, auras, and, in, rarer, cases, auditory, hallucinations, charles, bonnet, syndrome, is, the, name, given, to, visual, hallucinations, experienced, by, a, partially, or, severely, sight, impaired, person, the, hallucinations, can, occur, at, any, time, and, can, distress, people, of, any, age, as, they, may, not, initially, be, aware, that, they, are, hallucinating, they, may, fear, for, their, own, mental, health, initially, which, may, delay, them, sharing, with, carers, until, they, start, to, understand, it, themselves, the, hallucinations, can, frighten, and, disconcert, as, to, what, is, real, and, what, is, not, the, hallucinations, can, sometimes, be, dispersed, by, eye, movements, or, by, reasoned, logic, such, as, i, can, see, fire, but, there, is, no, smoke, and, there, is, no, heat, from, it, or, perhaps, we, have, an, infestation, of, rats, but, they, have, pink, ribbons, with, a, bell, tied, on, their, necks, over, elapsed, months, and, years, the, hallucinations, may, become, more, or, less, frequent, with, changes, in, ability, to, see, the, length, of, time, that, the, sight, impaired, person, can, have, these, hallucinations, varies, according, to, the, underlying, speed, of, eye, deterioration, a, differential, diagnosis, are, ophthalmopathic, hallucinations, visual, hallucinations, due, to, focal, seizures, differ, depending, on, the, region, of, the, brain, where, the, seizure, occurs, for, example, visual, hallucinations, during, occipital, lobe, seizures, are, typically, visions, of, brightly, colored, geometric, shapes, that, may, move, across, the, visual, field, multiply, or, form, concentric, rings, and, generally, persist, from, a, few, seconds, to, a, few, minutes, they, are, usually, unilateral, and, localized, to, one, part, of, the, visual, field, on, the, contralateral, side, of, the, seizure, focus, typically, the, temporal, field, however, unilateral, visions, moving, horizontally, across, the, visual, field, begin, on, the, contralateral, side, and, move, toward, the, ipsilateral, side, temporal, lobe, seizures, on, the, other, hand, can, produce, complex, visual, hallucinations, of, people, scenes, animals, and, more, as, well, as, distortions, of, visual, perception, complex, hallucinations, may, appear, to, be, real, or, unreal, may, or, may, not, be, distorted, with, respect, to, size, and, may, seem, disturbing, or, affable, among, other, variables, one, rare, but, notable, type, of, hallucination, is, heautoscopy, a, hallucination, of, a, mirror, image, of, one, s, self, these, other, selves, may, be, perfectly, still, or, performing, complex, tasks, may, be, an, image, of, a, younger, self, or, the, present, self, and, tend, to, be, briefly, present, complex, hallucinations, are, a, relatively, uncommon, finding, in, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, patients, rarely, they, may, occur, during, occipital, focal, seizures, or, in, parietal, lobe, seizures, distortions, in, visual, perception, during, a, temporal, lobe, seizure, may, include, size, distortion, micropsia, or, macropsia, distorted, perception, of, movement, where, moving, objects, may, appear, to, be, moving, very, slowly, or, to, be, perfectly, still, a, sense, that, surfaces, such, as, ceilings, and, even, entire, horizons, are, moving, farther, away, in, a, fashion, similar, to, the, dolly, zoom, effect, and, other, illusions, even, when, consciousness, is, impaired, insight, into, the, hallucination, or, illusion, is, typically, preserved, drug, induced, hallucinations, are, caused, by, hallucinogens, dissociatives, and, deliriants, including, many, drugs, with, anticholinergic, actions, and, certain, stimulants, which, are, known, to, cause, visual, and, auditory, hallucinations, some, psychedelics, such, as, lysergic, acid, diethylamide, lsd, and, psilocybin, can, cause, hallucinations, that, range, in, the, spectrum, of, mild, to, intense, hallucinations, pseudohallucinations, or, intensification, of, pareidolia, particularly, auditory, are, known, side, effects, of, opioids, to, different, degrees, it, may, be, associated, with, the, absolute, degree, of, agonism, or, antagonism, of, especially, the, kappa, opioid, receptor, sigma, receptors, delta, opioid, receptor, and, the, nmda, receptors, or, the, overall, receptor, activation, profile, as, synthetic, opioids, like, those, of, the, pentazocine, levorphanol, fentanyl, pethidine, methadone, and, some, other, families, are, more, associated, with, this, side, effect, than, natural, opioids, like, morphine, and, codeine, and, semi, synthetics, like, hydromorphone, amongst, which, there, also, appears, to, be, a, stronger, correlation, with, the, relative, analgesic, strength, three, opioids, cyclazocine, a, benzormorphan, opioid, pentazocine, relative, and, two, levorphanol, related, morphinan, opioids, cyclorphan, and, dextrorphan, are, classified, as, hallucinogens, and, dextromethorphan, as, a, dissociative, these, drugs, also, can, induce, sleep, relating, to, hypnagogic, hallucinations, and, especially, the, pethidines, have, atropine, like, anticholinergic, activity, which, was, possibly, also, a, limiting, factor, in, the, use, the, psychotomimetic, side, effects, of, potentiating, morphine, oxycodone, and, other, opioids, with, scopolamine, respectively, in, the, twilight, sleep, technique, and, the, combination, drug, skophedal, which, was, eukodal, oxycodone, scopolamine, and, ephedrine, called, the, wonder, drug, of, the, 1930s, after, its, invention, in, germany, in, 1928, but, only, rarely, specially, compounded, today, q, q, v, hallucinations, can, be, caused, by, sensory, deprivation, when, it, occurs, for, prolonged, periods, of, time, and, almost, always, occurs, in, the, modality, being, deprived, visual, for, blindfolded, darkness, auditory, for, muffled, conditions, etc, anomalous, experiences, such, as, so, called, benign, hallucinations, may, occur, in, a, person, in, a, state, of, good, mental, and, physical, health, even, in, the, apparent, absence, of, a, transient, trigger, factor, such, as, fatigue, intoxication, or, sensory, deprivation, the, evidence, for, this, statement, has, been, accumulating, for, more, than, a, century, studies, of, benign, hallucinatory, experiences, go, back, to, 1886, and, the, early, work, of, the, society, for, psychical, research, which, suggested, approximately, 10, of, the, population, had, experienced, at, least, one, hallucinatory, episode, in, the, course, of, their, life, more, recent, studies, have, validated, these, findings, the, precise, incidence, found, varies, with, the, nature, of, the, episode, and, the, criteria, of, hallucination, adopted, but, the, basic, finding, is, now, well, supported, there, is, tentative, evidence, of, a, relationship, with, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, the, so, called, gluten, psychosis, it, has, been, reported, that, in, serotonergic, hallucinations, the, person, maintains, an, awareness, that, they, are, hallucinating, unlike, dopaminergic, hallucinations, hallucinations, are, associated, with, structural, and, functional, abnormalities, in, primary, and, secondary, sensory, cortices, reduced, grey, matter, in, regions, of, the, superior, temporal, gyrus, middle, temporal, gyrus, including, broca, s, area, is, associated, with, auditory, hallucinations, as, a, trait, while, acute, hallucinations, are, associated, with, increased, activity, in, the, same, regions, along, with, the, hippocampus, parahippocampus, and, the, right, hemispheric, homologue, of, broca, s, area, in, the, inferior, frontal, gyrus, grey, and, white, matter, abnormalities, in, visual, regions, are, associated, with, hallucinations, in, diseases, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, further, supporting, the, notion, of, dysfunction, in, sensory, regions, underlying, hallucinations, one, proposed, model, of, hallucinations, posits, that, over, activity, in, sensory, regions, which, is, normally, attributed, to, internal, sources, via, feedforward, networks, to, the, inferior, frontal, gyrus, is, interpreted, as, originating, externally, due, to, abnormal, connectivity, or, functionality, of, the, feedforward, network, this, is, supported, by, cognitive, studies, of, those, with, hallucinations, who, have, demonstrated, abnormal, attribution, of, self, generated, stimuli, disruptions, in, thalamocortical, circuitry, may, underlie, the, observed, top, down, and, bottom, up, dysfunction, thalamocortical, circuits, composed, of, projections, between, thalamic, and, cortical, neurons, and, adjacent, interneurons, underlie, certain, electrophysical, characteristics, gamma, oscillations, that, are, associated, with, sensory, processing, cortical, inputs, to, thalamic, neurons, enable, attentional, modulation, of, sensory, neurons, dysfunction, in, sensory, afferents, and, abnormal, cortical, input, may, result, in, pre, existing, expectations, modulating, sensory, experience, potentially, resulting, in, the, generation, of, hallucinations, hallucinations, are, associated, with, less, accurate, sensory, processing, and, more, intense, stimuli, with, less, interference, are, necessary, for, accurate, processing, and, the, appearance, of, gamma, oscillations, called, gamma, synchrony, hallucinations, are, also, associated, with, the, absence, of, reduction, in, p50, amplitude, in, response, to, the, presentation, of, a, second, stimuli, after, an, initial, stimulus, this, is, thought, to, represent, failure, to, gate, sensory, stimuli, and, can, be, exacerbated, by, dopamine, release, agents, abnormal, assignment, of, salience, to, stimuli, may, be, one, mechanism, of, hallucinations, dysfunctional, dopamine, signaling, may, lead, to, abnormal, top, down, regulation, of, sensory, processing, allowing, expectations, to, distort, sensory, input, there, are, few, treatments, for, many, types, of, hallucinations, however, for, those, hallucinations, caused, by, mental, disease, a, psychologist, or, psychiatrist, should, be, consulted, and, treatment, will, be, based, on, the, observations, of, those, doctors, antipsychotic, and, atypical, antipsychotic, medication, may, also, be, utilized, to, treat, the, illness, if, the, symptoms, are, severe, and, cause, significant, distress, for, other, causes, of, hallucinations, there, is, no, factual, evidence, to, support, any, one, treatment, is, scientifically, tested, and, proven, however, abstaining, from, hallucinogenic, drugs, stimulant, drugs, managing, stress, levels, living, healthily, and, getting, plenty, of, sleep, can, help, reduce, the, prevalence, of, hallucinations, in, all, cases, of, hallucinations, medical, attention, should, be, sought, out, and, informed, of, one, s, specific, symptoms, meta, analyses, show, that, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, and, metacognitive, training, can, also, reduce, the, severity, of, hallucinations, furthermore, there, are, recovery, movements, all, around, the, world, that, advocate, for, individuals, with, schizophrenia, or, voice, hearers, individuals, that, hear, voices, the, hearing, voices, movement, starting, in, europe, is, a, great, example, of, utilizing, the, knowledge, and, experience, of, voice, hearers, and, combining, it, with, experts, in, disorders, such, as, schizophrenia, such, as, psychiatrists, prevalence, of, hallucinations, varies, depending, on, underlying, medical, conditions, which, sensory, modalities, are, affected, age, and, culture, as, of, 2022, auditory, hallucinations, are, the, most, well, studied, and, most,
