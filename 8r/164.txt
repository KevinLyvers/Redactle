biochemistry, or, biological, chemistry, is, the, study, of, chemical, processes, within, and, relating, to, living, organisms, a, sub, discipline, of, both, chemistry, and, biology, biochemistry, may, be, divided, into, three, fields, structural, biology, enzymology, and, metabolism, over, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, biochemistry, has, become, successful, at, explaining, living, processes, through, these, three, disciplines, almost, all, areas, of, the, life, sciences, are, being, uncovered, and, developed, through, biochemical, methodology, and, research, biochemistry, focuses, on, understanding, the, chemical, basis, which, allows, biological, molecules, to, give, rise, to, the, processes, that, occur, within, living, cells, and, between, cells, in, turn, relating, greatly, to, the, understanding, of, tissues, and, organs, as, well, as, organism, structure, and, function, biochemistry, is, closely, related, to, molecular, biology, the, study, of, the, molecular, mechanisms, of, biological, phenomena, much, of, biochemistry, deals, with, the, structures, functions, and, interactions, of, biological, macromolecules, such, as, proteins, nucleic, acids, carbohydrates, and, lipids, they, provide, the, structure, of, cells, and, perform, many, of, the, functions, associated, with, life, the, chemistry, of, the, cell, also, depends, upon, the, reactions, of, small, molecules, and, ions, these, can, be, inorganic, for, example, water, and, metal, ions, or, organic, for, example, the, amino, acids, which, are, used, to, synthesize, proteins, the, mechanisms, used, by, cells, to, harness, energy, from, their, environment, via, chemical, reactions, are, known, as, metabolism, the, findings, of, biochemistry, are, applied, primarily, in, medicine, nutrition, and, agriculture, in, medicine, biochemists, investigate, the, causes, and, cures, of, diseases, nutrition, studies, how, to, maintain, health, and, wellness, and, also, the, effects, of, nutritional, deficiencies, in, agriculture, biochemists, investigate, soil, and, fertilizers, with, the, goal, of, improving, crop, cultivation, crop, storage, and, pest, control, in, recent, decades, biochemical, principles, and, methods, have, been, combined, with, problem, solving, approaches, from, engineering, to, manipulate, living, systems, in, order, to, produce, useful, tools, for, research, industrial, processes, and, diagnosis, and, control, of, disease, the, discipline, of, biotechnology, at, its, most, comprehensive, definition, biochemistry, can, be, seen, as, a, study, of, the, components, and, composition, of, living, things, and, how, they, come, together, to, become, life, in, this, sense, the, history, of, biochemistry, may, therefore, go, back, as, far, as, the, ancient, greeks, however, biochemistry, as, a, specific, scientific, discipline, began, sometime, in, the, 19th, century, or, a, little, earlier, depending, on, which, aspect, of, biochemistry, is, being, focused, on, some, argued, that, the, beginning, of, biochemistry, may, have, been, the, discovery, of, the, first, enzyme, diastase, now, called, amylase, in, 1833, by, anselme, payen, while, others, considered, eduard, buchner, s, first, demonstration, of, a, complex, biochemical, process, alcoholic, fermentation, in, cell, free, extracts, in, 1897, to, be, the, birth, of, biochemistry, some, might, also, point, as, its, beginning, to, the, influential, 1842, work, by, justus, von, liebig, animal, chemistry, or, organic, chemistry, in, its, applications, to, physiology, and, pathology, which, presented, a, chemical, theory, of, metabolism, or, even, earlier, to, the, 18th, century, studies, on, fermentation, and, respiration, by, antoine, lavoisier, many, other, pioneers, in, the, field, who, helped, to, uncover, the, layers, of, complexity, of, biochemistry, have, been, proclaimed, founders, of, modern, biochemistry, emil, fischer, who, studied, the, chemistry, of, proteins, and, f, gowland, hopkins, who, studied, enzymes, and, the, dynamic, nature, of, biochemistry, represent, two, examples, of, early, biochemists, the, term, biochemistry, was, first, used, when, vinzenz, kletzinsky, 1826, 1882, had, his, compendium, der, biochemie, printed, in, vienna, in, 1858, it, derived, from, a, combination, of, biology, and, chemistry, in, 1877, felix, hoppe, seyler, used, the, term, biochemie, in, german, as, a, synonym, for, physiological, chemistry, in, the, foreword, to, the, first, issue, of, zeitschrift, f, r, physiologische, chemie, journal, of, physiological, chemistry, where, he, argued, for, the, setting, up, of, institutes, dedicated, to, this, field, of, study, the, german, chemist, carl, neuberg, however, is, often, cited, to, have, coined, the, word, in, 1903, while, some, credited, it, to, franz, hofmeister, it, was, once, generally, believed, that, life, and, its, materials, had, some, essential, property, or, substance, often, referred, to, as, the, vital, principle, distinct, from, any, found, in, non, living, matter, and, it, was, thought, that, only, living, beings, could, produce, the, molecules, of, life, in, 1828, friedrich, w, hler, published, a, paper, on, his, serendipitous, urea, synthesis, from, potassium, cyanate, and, ammonium, sulfate, some, regarded, that, as, a, direct, overthrow, of, vitalism, and, the, establishment, of, organic, chemistry, however, the, w, hler, synthesis, has, sparked, controversy, as, some, reject, the, death, of, vitalism, at, his, hands, since, then, biochemistry, has, advanced, especially, since, the, mid, 20th, century, with, the, development, of, new, techniques, such, as, chromatography, x, ray, diffraction, dual, polarisation, interferometry, nmr, spectroscopy, radioisotopic, labeling, electron, microscopy, and, molecular, dynamics, simulations, these, techniques, allowed, for, the, discovery, and, detailed, analysis, of, many, molecules, and, metabolic, pathways, of, the, cell, such, as, glycolysis, and, the, krebs, cycle, citric, acid, cycle, and, led, to, an, understanding, of, biochemistry, on, a, molecular, level, another, significant, historic, event, in, biochemistry, is, the, discovery, of, the, gene, and, its, role, in, the, transfer, of, information, in, the, cell, in, the, 1950s, james, d, watson, francis, crick, rosalind, franklin, and, maurice, wilkins, were, instrumental, in, solving, dna, structure, and, suggesting, its, relationship, with, the, genetic, transfer, of, information, in, 1958, george, beadle, and, edward, tatum, received, the, nobel, prize, for, work, in, fungi, showing, that, one, gene, produces, one, enzyme, in, 1988, colin, pitchfork, was, the, first, person, convicted, of, murder, with, dna, evidence, which, led, to, the, growth, of, forensic, science, more, recently, andrew, z, fire, and, craig, c, mello, received, the, 2006, nobel, prize, for, discovering, the, role, of, rna, interference, rnai, in, the, silencing, of, gene, expression, around, two, dozen, chemical, elements, are, essential, to, various, kinds, of, biological, life, most, rare, elements, on, earth, are, not, needed, by, life, exceptions, being, selenium, and, iodine, while, a, few, common, ones, aluminum, and, titanium, are, not, used, most, organisms, share, element, needs, but, there, are, a, few, differences, between, plants, and, animals, for, example, ocean, algae, use, bromine, but, land, plants, and, animals, do, not, seem, to, need, any, all, animals, require, sodium, but, is, not, an, essential, element, for, plants, plants, need, boron, and, silicon, but, animals, may, not, or, may, need, ultra, small, amounts, just, six, elements, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and, phosphorus, make, up, almost, 99, of, the, mass, of, living, cells, including, those, in, the, human, body, see, composition, of, the, human, body, for, a, complete, list, in, addition, to, the, six, major, elements, that, compose, most, of, the, human, body, humans, require, smaller, amounts, of, possibly, 18, more, the, 4, main, classes, of, molecules, in, biochemistry, often, called, biomolecules, are, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, many, biological, molecules, are, polymers, in, this, terminology, monomers, are, relatively, small, macromolecules, that, are, linked, together, to, create, large, macromolecules, known, as, polymers, when, monomers, are, linked, together, to, synthesize, a, biological, polymer, they, undergo, a, process, called, dehydration, synthesis, different, macromolecules, can, assemble, in, larger, complexes, often, needed, for, biological, activity, two, of, the, main, functions, of, carbohydrates, are, energy, storage, and, providing, structure, one, of, the, common, sugars, known, as, glucose, is, a, carbohydrate, but, not, all, carbohydrates, are, sugars, there, are, more, carbohydrates, on, earth, than, any, other, known, type, of, biomolecule, they, are, used, to, store, energy, and, genetic, information, as, well, as, play, important, roles, in, cell, to, cell, interactions, and, communications, the, simplest, type, of, carbohydrate, is, a, monosaccharide, which, among, other, properties, contains, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, mostly, in, a, ratio, of, 1, 2, 1, generalized, formula, c, n, h, 2, n, o, n, where, n, is, at, least, 3, glucose, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, is, one, of, the, most, important, carbohydrates, others, include, fructose, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, the, sugar, commonly, associated, with, the, sweet, taste, of, fruits, and, deoxyribose, c, 5, h, 10, o, 4, a, component, of, dna, a, monosaccharide, can, switch, between, acyclic, open, chain, form, and, a, cyclic, form, the, open, chain, form, can, be, turned, into, a, ring, of, carbon, atoms, bridged, by, an, oxygen, atom, created, from, the, carbonyl, group, of, one, end, and, the, hydroxyl, group, of, another, the, cyclic, molecule, has, a, hemiacetal, or, hemiketal, group, depending, on, whether, the, linear, form, was, an, aldose, or, a, ketose, in, these, cyclic, forms, the, ring, usually, has, 5, or, 6, atoms, these, forms, are, called, furanoses, and, pyranoses, respectively, by, analogy, with, furan, and, pyran, the, simplest, compounds, with, the, same, carbon, oxygen, ring, although, they, lack, the, carbon, carbon, double, bonds, of, these, two, molecules, for, example, the, aldohexose, glucose, may, form, a, hemiacetal, linkage, between, the, hydroxyl, on, carbon, 1, and, the, oxygen, on, carbon, 4, yielding, a, molecule, with, a, 5, membered, ring, called, glucofuranose, the, same, reaction, can, take, place, between, carbons, 1, and, 5, to, form, a, molecule, with, a, 6, membered, ring, called, glucopyranose, cyclic, forms, with, a, 7, atom, ring, called, heptoses, are, rare, two, monosaccharides, can, be, joined, by, a, glycosidic, or, ester, bond, into, a, disaccharide, through, a, dehydration, reaction, during, which, a, molecule, of, water, is, released, the, reverse, reaction, in, which, the, glycosidic, bond, of, a, disaccharide, is, broken, into, two, monosaccharides, is, termed, hydrolysis, the, best, known, disaccharide, is, sucrose, or, ordinary, sugar, which, consists, of, a, glucose, molecule, and, a, fructose, molecule, joined, another, important, disaccharide, is, lactose, found, in, milk, consisting, of, a, glucose, molecule, and, a, galactose, molecule, lactose, may, be, hydrolysed, by, lactase, and, deficiency, in, this, enzyme, results, in, lactose, intolerance, when, a, few, around, three, to, six, monosaccharides, are, joined, it, is, called, an, oligosaccharide, oligo, meaning, few, these, molecules, tend, to, be, used, as, markers, and, signals, as, well, as, having, some, other, uses, many, monosaccharides, joined, form, a, polysaccharide, they, can, be, joined, in, one, long, linear, chain, or, they, may, be, branched, two, of, the, most, common, polysaccharides, are, cellulose, and, glycogen, both, consisting, of, repeating, glucose, monomers, cellulose, is, an, important, structural, component, of, plant, s, cell, walls, and, glycogen, is, used, as, a, form, of, energy, storage, in, animals, sugar, can, be, characterized, by, having, reducing, or, non, reducing, ends, a, reducing, end, of, a, carbohydrate, is, a, carbon, atom, that, can, be, in, equilibrium, with, the, open, chain, aldehyde, aldose, or, keto, form, ketose, if, the, joining, of, monomers, takes, place, at, such, a, carbon, atom, the, free, hydroxy, group, of, the, pyranose, or, furanose, form, is, exchanged, with, an, oh, side, chain, of, another, sugar, yielding, a, full, acetal, this, prevents, opening, of, the, chain, to, the, aldehyde, or, keto, form, and, renders, the, modified, residue, non, reducing, lactose, contains, a, reducing, end, at, its, glucose, moiety, whereas, the, galactose, moiety, forms, a, full, acetal, with, the, c4, oh, group, of, glucose, saccharose, does, not, have, a, reducing, end, because, of, full, acetal, formation, between, the, aldehyde, carbon, of, glucose, c1, and, the, keto, carbon, of, fructose, c2, lipids, comprise, a, diverse, range, of, molecules, and, to, some, extent, is, a, catchall, for, relatively, water, insoluble, or, nonpolar, compounds, of, biological, origin, including, waxes, fatty, acids, fatty, acid, derived, phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, and, terpenoids, e, g, retinoids, and, steroids, some, lipids, are, linear, open, chain, aliphatic, molecules, while, others, have, ring, structures, some, are, aromatic, with, a, cyclic, and, planar, structure, while, others, are, not, some, are, flexible, while, others, are, rigid, lipids, are, usually, made, from, one, molecule, of, glycerol, combined, with, other, molecules, in, triglycerides, the, main, group, of, bulk, lipids, there, is, one, molecule, of, glycerol, and, three, fatty, acids, fatty, acids, are, considered, the, monomer, in, that, case, and, maybe, saturated, no, double, bonds, in, the, carbon, chain, or, unsaturated, one, or, more, double, bonds, in, the, carbon, chain, most, lipids, have, some, polar, character, and, are, largely, nonpolar, in, general, the, bulk, of, their, structure, is, nonpolar, or, hydrophobic, water, fearing, meaning, that, it, does, not, interact, well, with, polar, solvents, like, water, another, part, of, their, structure, is, polar, or, hydrophilic, water, loving, and, will, tend, to, associate, with, polar, solvents, like, water, this, makes, them, amphiphilic, molecules, having, both, hydrophobic, and, hydrophilic, portions, in, the, case, of, cholesterol, the, polar, group, is, a, mere, oh, hydroxyl, or, alcohol, in, the, case, of, phospholipids, the, polar, groups, are, considerably, larger, and, more, polar, as, described, below, lipids, are, an, integral, part, of, our, daily, diet, most, oils, and, milk, products, that, we, use, for, cooking, and, eating, like, butter, cheese, ghee, etc, are, composed, of, fats, vegetable, oils, are, rich, in, various, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, pufa, lipid, containing, foods, undergo, digestion, within, the, body, and, are, broken, into, fatty, acids, and, glycerol, the, final, degradation, products, of, fats, and, lipids, lipids, especially, phospholipids, are, also, used, in, various, pharmaceutical, products, either, as, co, solubilizers, e, g, in, parenteral, infusions, or, else, as, drug, carrier, components, e, g, in, a, liposome, or, transfersome, proteins, are, very, large, molecules, macro, biopolymers, made, from, monomers, called, amino, acids, an, amino, acid, consists, of, an, alpha, carbon, atom, attached, to, an, amino, group, nh, 2, a, carboxylic, acid, group, cooh, although, these, exist, as, nh, 3, and, coo, under, physiologic, conditions, a, simple, hydrogen, atom, and, a, side, chain, commonly, denoted, as, r, the, side, chain, r, is, different, for, each, amino, acid, of, which, there, are, 20, standard, ones, it, is, this, r, group, that, makes, each, amino, acid, different, and, the, properties, of, the, side, chains, greatly, influence, the, overall, three, dimensional, conformation, of, a, protein, some, amino, acids, have, functions, by, themselves, or, in, a, modified, form, for, instance, glutamate, functions, as, an, important, neurotransmitter, amino, acids, can, be, joined, via, a, peptide, bond, in, this, dehydration, synthesis, a, water, molecule, is, removed, and, the, peptide, bond, connects, the, nitrogen, of, one, amino, acid, s, amino, group, to, the, carbon, of, the, other, s, carboxylic, acid, group, the, resulting, molecule, is, called, a, dipeptide, and, short, stretches, of, amino, acids, usually, fewer, than, thirty, are, called, peptides, or, polypeptides, longer, stretches, merit, the, title, proteins, as, an, example, the, important, blood, serum, protein, albumin, contains, 585, amino, acid, residues, proteins, can, have, structural, and, or, functional, roles, for, instance, movements, of, the, proteins, actin, and, myosin, ultimately, are, responsible, for, the, contraction, of, skeletal, muscle, one, property, many, proteins, have, is, that, they, specifically, bind, to, a, certain, molecule, or, class, of, molecules, they, may, be, extremely, selective, in, what, they, bind, antibodies, are, an, example, of, proteins, that, attach, to, one, specific, type, of, molecule, antibodies, are, composed, of, heavy, and, light, chains, two, heavy, chains, would, be, linked, to, two, light, chains, through, disulfide, linkages, between, their, amino, acids, antibodies, are, specific, through, variation, based, on, differences, in, the, n, terminal, domain, the, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assay, elisa, which, uses, antibodies, is, one, of, the, most, sensitive, tests, modern, medicine, uses, to, detect, various, biomolecules, probably, the, most, important, proteins, however, are, the, enzymes, virtually, every, reaction, in, a, living, cell, requires, an, enzyme, to, lower, the, activation, energy, of, the, reaction, these, molecules, recognize, specific, reactant, molecules, called, substrates, they, then, catalyze, the, reaction, between, them, by, lowering, the, activation, energy, the, enzyme, speeds, up, that, reaction, by, a, rate, of, 10, 11, or, more, a, reaction, that, would, normally, take, over, 3, 000, years, to, complete, spontaneously, might, take, less, than, a, second, with, an, enzyme, the, enzyme, itself, is, not, used, up, in, the, process, and, is, free, to, catalyze, the, same, reaction, with, a, new, set, of, substrates, using, various, modifiers, the, activity, of, the, enzyme, can, be, regulated, enabling, control, of, the, biochemistry, of, the, cell, as, a, whole, the, structure, of, proteins, is, traditionally, described, in, a, hierarchy, of, four, levels, the, primary, structure, of, a, protein, consists, of, its, linear, sequence, of, amino, acids, for, instance, alanine, glycine, tryptophan, serine, glutamate, asparagine, glycine, lysine, secondary, structure, is, concerned, with, local, morphology, morphology, being, the, study, of, structure, some, combinations, of, amino, acids, will, tend, to, curl, up, in, a, coil, called, an, helix, or, into, a, sheet, called, a, sheet, some, helixes, can, be, seen, in, the, hemoglobin, schematic, above, tertiary, structure, is, the, entire, three, dimensional, shape, of, the, protein, this, shape, is, determined, by, the, sequence, of, amino, acids, in, fact, a, single, change, can, change, the, entire, structure, the, alpha, chain, of, hemoglobin, contains, 146, amino, acid, residues, substitution, of, the, glutamate, residue, at, position, 6, with, a, valine, residue, changes, the, behavior, of, hemoglobin, so, much, that, it, results, in, sickle, cell, disease, finally, quaternary, structure, is, concerned, with, the, structure, of, a, protein, with, multiple, peptide, subunits, like, hemoglobin, with, its, four, subunits, not, all, proteins, have, more, than, one, subunit, ingested, proteins, are, usually, broken, up, into, single, amino, acids, or, dipeptides, in, the, small, intestine, and, then, absorbed, they, can, then, be, joined, to, form, new, proteins, intermediate, products, of, glycolysis, the, citric, acid, cycle, and, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, can, be, used, to, form, all, twenty, amino, acids, and, most, bacteria, and, plants, possess, all, the, necessary, enzymes, to, synthesize, them, humans, and, other, mammals, however, can, synthesize, only, half, of, them, they, cannot, synthesize, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and, valine, because, they, must, be, ingested, these, are, the, essential, amino, acids, mammals, do, possess, the, enzymes, to, synthesize, alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and, tyrosine, the, nonessential, amino, acids, while, they, can, synthesize, arginine, and, histidine, they, cannot, produce, it, in, sufficient, amounts, for, young, growing, animals, and, so, these, are, often, considered, essential, amino, acids, if, the, amino, group, is, removed, from, an, amino, acid, it, leaves, behind, a, carbon, skeleton, called, an, keto, acid, enzymes, called, transaminases, can, easily, transfer, the, amino, group, from, one, amino, acid, making, it, an, keto, acid, to, another, keto, acid, making, it, an, amino, acid, this, is, important, in, the, biosynthesis, of, amino, acids, as, for, many, of, the, pathways, intermediates, from, other, biochemical, pathways, are, converted, to, the, keto, acid, skeleton, and, then, an, amino, group, is, added, often, via, transamination, the, amino, acids, may, then, be, linked, together, to, form, a, protein, a, similar, process, is, used, to, break, down, proteins, it, is, first, hydrolyzed, into, its, component, amino, acids, free, ammonia, nh3, existing, as, the, ammonium, ion, nh4, in, blood, is, toxic, to, life, forms, a, suitable, method, for, excreting, it, must, therefore, exist, different, tactics, have, evolved, in, different, animals, depending, on, the, animals, needs, unicellular, organisms, release, the, ammonia, into, the, environment, likewise, bony, fish, can, release, ammonia, into, the, water, where, it, is, quickly, diluted, in, general, mammals, convert, ammonia, into, urea, via, the, urea, cycle, in, order, to, determine, whether, two, proteins, are, related, or, in, other, words, to, decide, whether, they, are, homologous, or, not, scientists, use, sequence, comparison, methods, methods, like, sequence, alignments, and, structural, alignments, are, powerful, tools, that, help, scientists, identify, homologies, between, related, molecules, the, relevance, of, finding, homologies, among, proteins, goes, beyond, forming, an, evolutionary, pattern, of, protein, families, by, finding, how, similar, two, protein, sequences, are, we, acquire, knowledge, about, their, structure, and, therefore, their, function, nucleic, acids, so, called, because, of, their, prevalence, in, cellular, nuclei, is, the, generic, name, of, the, family, of, biopolymers, they, are, complex, high, molecular, weight, biochemical, macromolecules, that, can, convey, genetic, information, in, all, living, cells, and, viruses, the, monomers, are, called, nucleotides, and, each, consists, of, three, components, a, nitrogenous, heterocyclic, base, either, a, purine, or, a, pyrimidine, a, pentose, sugar, and, a, phosphate, group, the, most, common, nucleic, acids, are, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, and, ribonucleic, acid, rna, the, phosphate, group, and, the, sugar, of, each, nucleotide, bond, with, each, other, to, form, the, backbone, of, the, nucleic, acid, while, the, sequence, of, nitrogenous, bases, stores, the, information, the, most, common, nitrogenous, bases, are, adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and, uracil, the, nitrogenous, bases, of, each, strand, of, a, nucleic, acid, will, form, hydrogen, bonds, with, certain, other, nitrogenous, bases, in, a, complementary, strand, of, nucleic, acid, adenine, binds, with, thymine, and, uracil, thymine, binds, only, with, adenine, and, cytosine, and, guanine, can, bind, only, with, one, another, adenine, thymine, and, uracil, contain, two, hydrogen, bonds, while, hydrogen, bonds, formed, between, cytosine, and, guanine, are, three, aside, from, the, genetic, material, of, the, cell, nucleic, acids, often, play, a, role, as, second, messengers, as, well, as, forming, the, base, molecule, for, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, the, primary, energy, carrier, molecule, found, in, all, living, organisms, also, the, nitrogenous, bases, possible, in, the, two, nucleic, acids, are, different, adenine, cytosine, and, guanine, occur, in, both, rna, and, dna, while, thymine, occurs, only, in, dna, and, uracil, occurs, in, rna, glucose, is, an, energy, source, in, most, life, forms, for, instance, polysaccharides, are, broken, down, into, their, monomers, by, enzymes, glycogen, phosphorylase, removes, glucose, residues, from, glycogen, a, polysaccharide, disaccharides, like, lactose, or, sucrose, are, cleaved, into, their, two, component, monosaccharides, glucose, is, mainly, metabolized, by, a, very, important, ten, step, pathway, called, glycolysis, the, net, result, of, which, is, to, break, down, one, molecule, of, glucose, into, two, molecules, of, pyruvate, this, also, produces, a, net, two, molecules, of, atp, the, energy, currency, of, cells, along, with, two, reducing, equivalents, of, converting, nad, nicotinamide, adenine, dinucleotide, oxidized, form, to, nadh, nicotinamide, adenine, dinucleotide, reduced, form, this, does, not, require, oxygen, if, no, oxygen, is, available, or, the, cell, cannot, use, oxygen, the, nad, is, restored, by, converting, the, pyruvate, to, lactate, lactic, acid, e, g, in, humans, or, to, ethanol, plus, carbon, dioxide, e, g, in, yeast, other, monosaccharides, like, galactose, and, fructose, can, be, converted, into, intermediates, of, the, glycolytic, pathway, in, aerobic, cells, with, sufficient, oxygen, as, in, most, human, cells, the, pyruvate, is, further, metabolized, it, is, irreversibly, converted, to, acetyl, coa, giving, off, one, carbon, atom, as, the, waste, product, carbon, dioxide, generating, another, reducing, equivalent, as, nadh, the, two, molecules, acetyl, coa, from, one, molecule, of, glucose, then, enter, the, citric, acid, cycle, producing, two, molecules, of, atp, six, more, nadh, molecules, and, two, reduced, ubi, quinones, via, fadh, 2, as, enzyme, bound, cofactor, and, releasing, the, remaining, carbon, atoms, as, carbon, dioxide, the, produced, nadh, and, quinol, molecules, then, feed, into, the, enzyme, complexes, of, the, respiratory, chain, an, electron, transport, system, transferring, the, electrons, ultimately, to, oxygen, and, conserving, the, released, energy, in, the, form, of, a, proton, gradient, over, a, membrane, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, in, eukaryotes, thus, oxygen, is, reduced, to, water, and, the, original, electron, acceptors, nad, and, quinone, are, regenerated, this, is, why, humans, breathe, in, oxygen, and, breathe, out, carbon, dioxide, the, energy, released, from, transferring, the, electrons, from, high, energy, states, in, nadh, and, quinol, is, conserved, first, as, proton, gradient, and, converted, to, atp, via, atp, synthase, this, generates, an, additional, 28, molecules, of, atp, 24, from, the, 8, nadh, 4, from, the, 2, quinols, totaling, to, 32, molecules, of, atp, conserved, per, degraded, glucose, two, from, glycolysis, two, from, the, citrate, cycle, it, is, clear, that, using, oxygen, to, completely, oxidize, glucose, provides, an, organism, with, far, more, energy, than, any, oxygen, independent, metabolic, feature, and, this, is, thought, to, be, the, reason, why, complex, life, appeared, only, after, earth, s, atmosphere, accumulated, large, amounts, of, oxygen, in, vertebrates, vigorously, contracting, skeletal, muscles, during, weightlifting, or, sprinting, for, example, do, not, receive, enough, oxygen, to, meet, the, energy, demand, and, so, they, shift, to, anaerobic, metabolism, converting, glucose, to, lactate, the, combination, of, glucose, from, noncarbohydrates, origin, such, as, fat, and, proteins, this, only, happens, when, glycogen, supplies, in, the, liver, are, worn, out, the, pathway, is, a, crucial, reversal, of, glycolysis, from, pyruvate, to, glucose, and, can, use, many, sources, like, amino, acids, glycerol, and, krebs, cycle, large, scale, protein, and, fat, catabolism, usually, occur, when, those, suffer, from, starvation, or, certain, endocrine, disorders, the, liver, regenerates, the, glucose, using, a, process, called, gluconeogenesis, this, process, is, not, quite, the, opposite, of, glycolysis, and, actually, requires, three, times, the, amount, of, energy, gained, from, glycolysis, six, molecules, of, atp, are, used, compared, to, the, two, gained, in, glycolysis, analogous, to, the, above, reactions, the, glucose, produced, can, then, undergo, glycolysis, in, tissues, that, need, energy, be, stored, as, glycogen, or, starch, in, plants, or, be, converted, to, other, monosaccharides, or, joined, into, di, or, oligosaccharides, the, combined, pathways, of, glycolysis, during, exercise, lactate, s, crossing, via, the, bloodstream, to, the, liver, subsequent, gluconeogenesis, and, release, of, glucose, into, the, bloodstream, is, called, the, cori, cycle, researchers, in, biochemistry, use, specific, techniques, native, to, biochemistry, but, increasingly, combine, these, with, techniques, and, ideas, developed, in, the, fields, of, genetics, molecular, biology, and, biophysics, there, is, not, a, defined, line, between, these, disciplines, biochemistry, studies, the, chemistry, required, for, biological, activity, of, molecules, molecular, biology, studies, their, biological, activity, genetics, studies, their, heredity, which, happens, to, be, carried, by, their, genome, this, is, shown, in, the, following, schematic, that, depicts, one, possible, view, of, the, relationships, between, the, fields
