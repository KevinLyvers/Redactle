varies, in, color, from, pale, yellow, to, dark, pink, red, grapefruit, is, a, citrus, hybrid, that, originated, in, barbados, in, the, 18th, century, it, is, an, accidental, cross, between, the, sweet, orange, c, sinensis, and, the, pomelo, or, shaddock, c, maxima, both, of, which, were, introduced, from, asia, in, the, 17th, century, it, has, also, been, called, the, forbidden, fruit, in, the, past, it, was, referred, to, as, the, pomelo, but, that, term, is, now, mostly, used, as, the, common, name, for, citrus, maxima, the, evergreen, grapefruit, trees, usually, grow, to, around, 5, 6, m, 16, 20, ft, tall, although, they, may, reach, 13, 15, m, 43, 49, ft, the, leaves, are, long, up, to, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, thin, glossy, and, dark, green, they, produce, 5, cm, 2, in, white, four, or, five, petaled, flowers, the, fruit, is, yellow, orange, skinned, and, generally, an, oblate, spheroid, in, shape, it, ranges, in, diameter, from, 10, to, 15, cm, 3, 9, to, 5, 9, in, its, flesh, is, segmented, and, acidic, varying, in, color, depending, on, the, cultivars, which, include, white, pink, and, red, pulps, of, varying, sweetness, generally, the, redder, varieties, are, the, sweetest, the, 1929, u, s, ruby, red, of, the, redblush, variety, was, the, first, grapefruit, patent, grapefruits, are, one, of, the, most, common, hosts, for, fruit, flies, such, as, a, suspensa, which, lay, their, eggs, in, overripe, or, spoiled, grapefruits, the, larvae, of, these, flies, then, consume, the, fruit, to, gain, nutrients, until, they, can, proceed, into, the, pupae, stage, this, parasitism, has, led, to, millions, in, economic, costs, for, nations, in, central, america, and, southern, north, america, the, varieties, of, texas, and, florida, grapefruit, include, duncan, flame, henderson, hudson, marsh, oro, blanco, pink, pummelo, hb, ray, rio, star, ruby, red, star, ruby, thompson, triumph, walters, white, marsh, the, 1929, ruby, red, or, redblush, patent, was, associated, with, real, commercial, success, which, came, after, the, discovery, of, a, red, grapefruit, growing, on, a, pink, variety, it, was, a, limb, sport, of, a, thompson, grapefruit, selected, by, a, e, henninger, the, thompson, was, a, limb, sport, from, a, marsh, grapefruit, selected, in, 1913, the, texas, legislature, designated, this, grapefruit, variety, the, official, state, fruit, of, texas, in, 1993, using, radiation, to, trigger, mutations, new, varieties, were, developed, to, retain, the, red, tones, that, typically, faded, to, pink, the, rio, red, variety, is, a, 1984, registered, texas, grapefruit, with, registered, trademarks, rio, star, and, ruby, sweet, also, sometimes, promoted, as, reddest, and, texas, choice, the, rio, red, is, a, mutation, bred, variety, that, was, developed, by, treatment, of, bud, sticks, with, thermal, neutrons, its, improved, attributes, of, mutant, variety, are, fruit, and, juice, color, deeper, red, and, wide, adaptation, the, star, ruby, is, the, darkest, of, the, red, varieties, developed, from, an, irradiated, hudson, grapefruit, hudson, being, a, limb, sport, of, foster, itself, a, limb, sport, of, the, walters, it, has, found, limited, commercial, success, because, it, is, more, difficult, to, grow, than, other, varieties, raw, white, grapefruit, is, 90, water, 8, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 1, 2, ounces, raw, grapefruit, provides, 138, kilojoules, 33, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, is, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, c, 40, of, the, daily, value, with, no, other, micronutrients, in, significant, amounts, a, grapefruit, supplies, about, 10, of, your, daily, potassium, needs, along, with, 8, of, your, requirements, for, thiamine, and, folate, grapefruit, juice, contains, about, half, the, citric, acid, of, lime, or, lemon, juice, and, about, 93, more, citric, acid, than, orange, juice, in, costa, rica, especially, in, atenas, grapefruit, are, often, cooked, to, remove, their, sourness, rendering, them, as, sweets, they, are, also, stuffed, with, dulce, de, leche, resulting, in, a, dessert, called, toronja, rellena, stuffed, grapefruit, in, haiti, grapefruit, is, used, primarily, for, its, juice, jus, de, chad, que, but, also, is, used, to, make, jam, confiture, de, chad, que, grapefruit, varieties, are, differentiated, by, the, flesh, color, of, fruit, they, produce, common, varieties, are, yellow, and, pink, pulp, colors, flavors, range, from, highly, acidic, and, somewhat, sour, to, sweet, and, tart, resulting, from, composition, of, sugars, mainly, sucrose, organic, acids, mainly, citric, acid, and, monoterpenes, and, sesquiterpenes, providing, aromas, grapefruit, mercaptan, a, sulfur, containing, terpene, is, one, of, the, aroma, compounds, influencing, taste, and, odor, of, grapefruit, compared, with, other, citrus, fruits, grapefruit, and, grapefruit, juice, have, been, found, to, interact, with, numerous, drugs, possibly, resulting, in, adverse, effects, possible, effects, include, abnormal, heart, rhythms, bleeding, inside, the, stomach, low, blood, pressure, difficulty, breathing, and, dizziness, among, others, one, interaction, occurs, from, grapefruit, furanocoumarins, such, as, bergamottin, and, 6, 7, dihydroxybergamottin, which, occur, in, both, flesh, and, peel, furanocoumarins, inhibit, the, cyp3a4, enzyme, among, others, from, the, p450, enzyme, family, responsible, for, metabolizing, 90, of, drugs, the, action, of, the, cyp3a4, enzyme, itself, is, to, metabolize, many, medications, if, the, drug, s, breakdown, for, removal, is, lessened, then, the, level, of, the, drug, in, the, blood, may, become, and, remain, high, leading, to, adverse, effects, on, the, other, hand, some, drugs, must, be, metabolized, to, become, active, and, inhibiting, cyp3a4, may, lead, to, reduced, drug, effects, the, other, effect, is, that, grapefruit, compounds, may, inhibit, the, absorption, of, drugs, in, the, intestine, if, the, drug, is, not, absorbed, then, not, enough, of, it, is, in, the, blood, to, have, a, therapeutic, effect, each, affected, drug, has, either, a, specific, increase, of, effect, or, decrease, one, whole, grapefruit, or, a, glass, of, 200, ml, 7, us, fl, oz, of, grapefruit, juice, may, cause, drug, overdose, toxicity, typically, drugs, that, are, incompatible, with, grapefruit, are, so, labeled, on, the, container, or, package, insert, in, 2022, world, production, of, grapefruits, combined, with, pomelos, was, 9, 8, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 53, of, the, world, total, with, vietnam, as, a, secondary, producer, grapefruit, originated, as, a, natural, hybrid, one, ancestor, of, the, grapefruit, was, the, jamaican, sweet, orange, citrus, sinensis, itself, an, ancient, hybrid, of, asian, origin, the, other, was, the, indonesian, pomelo, c, maxima, both, c, sinensis, and, c, maxima, were, present, in, the, west, indies, by, 1692, one, story, of, the, fruit, s, origin, is, that, a, certain, captain, shaddock, brought, pomelo, seeds, to, jamaica, and, bred, the, first, fruit, which, were, then, called, shaddocks, this, apparently, referred, to, a, captain, who, traded, in, the, west, indies, in, the, 17th, century, the, grapefruit, then, probably, originated, as, a, naturally, occurring, hybrid, between, the, two, plants, some, time, after, they, had, been, introduced, there, a, hybrid, fruit, called, forbidden, fruit, was, first, documented, in, 1750, along, with, 14, other, citrus, fruits, including, the, guiney, orange, by, a, welshman, rev, griffith, hughes, who, described, specimens, from, barbados, in, the, natural, history, of, barbados, however, hughes, s, forbidden, fruit, may, have, been, a, plant, distinct, from, grapefruit, although, still, closely, related, to, it, in, 1814, naturalist, john, lunan, published, the, term, grapefruit, to, describe, a, similar, jamaican, citrus, plant, lunan, reported, that, the, name, was, due, to, its, similarity, in, taste, to, the, grape, vitis, vinifera, an, alternative, explanation, offered, by, tussac, 1824, is, that, this, name, may, allude, to, clusters, of, the, fruit, on, the, tree, which, often, appear, similar, to, bunches, of, grapes, after, this, authors, of, the, period, used, both, terms, forbidden, fruit, and, grapefruit, as, synonyms, in, 1830, the, jamaican, version, of, the, plant, was, given, the, botanical, name, citrus, paradisi, by, botanist, james, macfadyen, macfadyen, identified, two, varieties, one, called, forbidden, fruit, the, other, called, barbadoes, grape, fruit, macfadyen, distinguished, between, the, two, plants, by, fruit, shape, with, the, barbados, grapefruit, being, piriform, pear, shaped, while, the, forbidden, fruit, was, maliformis, macfadyen, s, and, hughes, s, description, differ, so, it, is, not, clear, that, the, two, reports, are, describing, the, same, plant, kumamoto, et, al, 1987, suggest, that, hughes, s, golden, orange, was, actually, a, grapefruit, while, his, forbidden, fruit, was, a, different, plant, that, had, since, became, extinct, and, frequently, confused, with, grapefruits, later, kim, 1990, found, a, different, citrus, called, forbidden, fruit, or, shaddette, in, saint, lucia, that, is, closely, related, to, grapefruits, and, may, be, the, plant, described, by, hughes, and, macfadyen, the, name, grape, fruit, was, used, more, and, more, during, the, 19th, century, to, refer, to, pomelos, to, the, consternation, of, some, it, was, brought, to, florida, by, count, odet, philippe, in, 1823, in, what, is, now, known, as, safety, harbor, further, crosses, have, produced, the, tangelo, 1905, the, minneola, tangelo, 1931, and, the, oroblanco, 1984, its, true, origins, were, not, determined, until, the, 1940s, this, led, to, the, official, name, being, altered, to, citrus, paradisi, the, identifying, its, hybrid, origin, an, early, pioneer, in, the, american, citrus, industry, was, kimball, c, atwood, a, wealthy, entrepreneur, who, founded, the, atwood, grapefruit, company, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, atwood, grove, became, the, largest, grapefruit, grove, in, the, world, with, a, yearly, output, of, 80, 000, boxes, of, fruit, there, pink, grapefruit, was, first, discovered, in, 1906, grapefruit, is, a, pomelo, backcross, a, hybrid, of, pomelo, and, sweet, orange, which, is, in, turn, a, pomelo, mandarin, hybrid, the, grapefruit, is, a, parent, to, many, hybrids, related, citrus, fruits, include
