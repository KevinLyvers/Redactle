distinctive, black, and, white, striped, coats, there, are, three, living, species, gr, vy, s, zebra, equus, grevyi, the, plains, zebra, e, quagga, and, the, mountain, zebra, e, zebra, zebras, share, the, genus, equus, with, horses, and, asses, the, three, groups, being, the, only, living, members, of, the, family, equidae, zebra, stripes, come, in, different, patterns, unique, to, each, individual, several, theories, have, been, proposed, for, the, function, of, these, patterns, with, most, evidence, supporting, them, as, a, deterrent, for, biting, flies, zebras, inhabit, eastern, and, southern, africa, and, can, be, found, in, a, variety, of, habitats, such, as, savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and, mountainous, areas, zebras, are, primarily, grazers, and, can, subsist, on, lower, quality, vegetation, they, are, preyed, on, mainly, by, lions, and, typically, flee, when, threatened, but, also, bite, and, kick, zebra, species, differ, in, social, behaviour, with, plains, and, mountain, zebra, living, in, stable, harems, consisting, of, an, adult, male, or, stallion, several, adult, females, or, mares, and, their, young, or, foals, while, gr, vy, s, zebra, live, alone, or, in, loosely, associated, herds, in, harem, holding, species, adult, females, mate, only, with, their, harem, stallion, while, male, gr, vy, s, zebras, establish, territories, which, attract, females, and, the, species, is, promiscuous, zebras, communicate, with, various, vocalisations, body, postures, and, facial, expressions, social, grooming, strengthens, social, bonds, in, plains, and, mountain, zebras, zebras, dazzling, stripes, make, them, among, the, most, recognisable, mammals, they, have, been, featured, in, art, and, stories, in, africa, and, beyond, historically, they, have, been, highly, sought, by, exotic, animal, collectors, but, unlike, horses, and, donkeys, zebras, have, never, been, completely, domesticated, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, lists, gr, vy, s, zebra, as, endangered, the, mountain, zebra, as, vulnerable, and, the, plains, zebra, as, near, threatened, the, quagga, e, quagga, quagga, a, type, of, plains, zebra, was, driven, to, extinction, in, the, 19th, century, nevertheless, zebras, can, be, found, in, numerous, protected, areas, the, english, name, zebra, derives, from, italian, spanish, or, portuguese, its, origins, may, lie, in, the, latin, equiferus, meaning, wild, horse, equiferus, appears, to, have, entered, into, portuguese, as, ezebro, or, zebro, which, was, originally, used, for, a, legendary, equine, in, the, wilds, of, the, iberian, peninsula, during, the, middle, ages, in, 1591, italian, explorer, filippo, pigafetta, recorded, zebra, being, used, to, refer, to, the, african, animals, by, portuguese, visitors, to, the, continent, in, ancient, times, the, zebra, was, called, hippotigris, horse, tiger, by, the, greeks, and, romans, the, word, zebra, was, traditionally, pronounced, with, a, long, initial, vowel, but, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, the, pronunciation, with, the, short, initial, vowel, became, the, norm, in, british, english, the, pronunciation, with, a, long, initial, vowel, remains, standard, in, american, english, zebras, are, classified, in, the, genus, equus, known, as, equines, along, with, horses, and, asses, these, three, groups, are, the, only, living, members, of, the, family, equidae, the, plains, zebra, and, mountain, zebra, were, traditionally, placed, in, the, subgenus, hippotigris, c, h, smith, 1841, in, contrast, to, the, gr, vy, s, zebra, which, was, considered, the, sole, species, of, subgenus, dolichohippus, heller, 1912, groves, and, bell, 2004, placed, all, three, species, in, the, subgenus, hippotigris, a, 2013, phylogenetic, study, found, that, the, plains, zebra, is, more, closely, related, to, gr, vy, s, zebras, than, mountain, zebras, the, extinct, quagga, was, originally, classified, as, a, distinct, species, later, genetic, studies, have, placed, it, as, the, same, species, as, the, plains, zebra, either, a, subspecies, or, just, the, southernmost, population, molecular, evidence, supports, zebras, as, a, monophyletic, lineage, equus, originated, in, north, america, and, direct, paleogenomic, sequencing, of, a, 700, 000, year, old, middle,

eurasian, equus, ovodovi, and, the, subgenus, sussemionus, lineage, as, closer, to, zebras, than, to, asses, however, other, studies, disputed, this, placement, finding, the, sussemionus, lineage, basal, to, the, zebra, asses, group, but, suggested, that, the, sussemionus, lineage, may, have, received, gene, flow, from, zebras, the, cladogram, of, equus, below, is, based, on, vilstrup, and,

reported, in, the, wild, between, plains, and, gr, vy, s, zebra, hybridisation, has, also, been, recorded, between, the, plains, and, mountain, zebra, though, it, is, possible, that, these, are, infertile, due, to, the, difference, in, chromosome, numbers, between, the, two, species, captive, zebras, have, been, bred, with, horses, and, donkeys, these, are, known, as, zebroids, a, zorse, is, a, cross, between, a, zebra, and, a, horse, a, zonkey, between, a, zebra, and, a, donkey, and, a, zoni, between, a, zebra, and, a, pony, zebroids, are, often, born, sterile, with, dwarfism, as, with, all, wild, equines, zebras, have, barrel, chested, bodies, with, tufted, tails, elongated, faces, and, long, necks, with, long, erect, manes, their, thin, legs, are, each, supported, by, a, spade, shaped, toe, covered, in, a, hard, hoof, their, dentition, is, adapted, for, grazing, they, have, large, incisors, that, clip, grass, blades, and, rough, molars, and, premolars, well, suited, for, grinding, males, have, spade, shaped, canines, which, can, be, used, as, weapons, in, fighting, the, eyes, of, zebras, are, at, the, sides, and, far, up, the, head, which, allows, them, to, look, over, the, tall, grass, while, feeding, their, moderately, long, erect, ears, are, movable, and, can, locate, the, source, of, a, sound, unlike, horses, zebras, and, asses, have, chestnut, callosities, present, only, on, their, front, legs, in, contrast, to, other, living, equines, zebras, have, longer, front, legs, than, back, legs, diagnostic, traits, of, the, zebra, skull, include, its, relatively, small, size, with, a, straight, dorsal, outline, protruding, eye, sockets, narrower, rostrum, less, conspicuous, postorbital, bar, separation, of, the, metaconid, and, metastylid, of, the, tooth, by, a, v, shaped, canal, and, rounded, enamel, wall, zebras, are, easily, recognised, by, their, bold, black, and, white, striping, patterns, the, coat, appears, to, be, white, with, black, stripes, as, indicated, by, the, belly, and, legs, when, unstriped, but, the, skin, is, black, young, or, foals, are, born, with, brown, and, white, coats, and, the, brown, darkens, with, age, a, dorsal, line, acts, as, the, backbone, for, vertical, stripes, along, the, sides, from, the, head, to, the, rump, on, the, snout, they, curve, toward, the, nostrils, while, the, stripes, above, the, front, legs, split, into, two, branches, on, the, rump, they, develop, into, species, specific, patterns, the, stripes, on, the, legs, ears, and, tail, are, separate, and, horizontal, striping, patterns, are, unique, to, an, individual, and, heritable, during, embryonic, development, the, stripes, appear, at, eight, months, but, the, patterns, may, be, determined, at, three, to, five, weeks, for, each, species, there, is, a, point, in, embryonic, development, where, the, stripes, are, perpendicular, to, the, dorsal, line, and, spaced, 0, 4, mm, 0, 016, in, apart, however, this, happens, at, three, weeks, of, development, for, the, plains, zebra, four, weeks, for, the, mountain, zebra, and, five, for, gr, vy, s, zebra, the, difference, in, timing, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, differences, in, the, striping, patterns, of, the, different, species, various, abnormalities, of, the, patterns, have, been, documented, in, plains, zebras, in, melanistic, zebras, dark, stripes, are, highly, concentrated, on, the, torso, but, the, legs, are, whiter, spotted, individuals, have, broken, up, black, stripes, around, the, dorsal, area, there, have, even, been, morphs, with, white, spots, on, dark, backgrounds, striping, abnormalities, have, been, linked, to, inbreeding, albino, zebras, have, been, recorded, in, the, forests, of, mount, kenya, with, the, dark, stripes, being, blonde, the, quagga, had, brown, and, white, stripes, on, the, head, and, neck, brown, upper, parts, and, a, white, belly, tail, and, legs, the, function, of, stripes, in, zebras, has, been, discussed, among, biologists, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, popular, hypotheses, include, the, following, zebras, may, travel, or, migrate, to, wetter, areas, during, the, dry, season, plains, zebras, have, been, recorded, travelling, 500, km, 310, mi, between, namibia, and, botswana, the, longest, land, migration, of, mammals, in, africa, when, migrating, they, appear, to, rely, on, some, memory, of, the, locations, where, foraging, conditions, were, best, and, may, predict, conditions, months, after, their, arrival, plains, zebras, are, more, water, dependent, and, live, in, moister, environments, than, other, species, they, usually, can, be, found, 10, 12, km, 6, 2, 7, 5, mi, from, a, water, source, gr, vy, s, zebras, can, survive, almost, a, week, without, water, but, will, drink, it, every, day, when, given, the, chance, and, their, bodies, maintain, water, better, than, cattle, mountain, zebras, can, be, found, at, elevations, of, up, to, 2, 000, m, 6, 600, ft, zebras, sleep, for, seven, hours, a, day, standing, up, during, the, day, and, lying, down, during, the, night, they, regularly, use, various, objects, as, rubbing, posts, and, will, roll, on, the, ground, a, zebra, s, diet, is, mostly, grasses, and, sedges, but, they, will, opportunistically, consume, bark, leaves, buds, fruits, and, roots, compared, to, ruminants, zebras, have, a, simpler, and, less, efficient, digestive, system, nevertheless, they, can, subsist, on, lower, quality, vegetation, zebras, may, spend, 60, 80, of, their, time, feeding, depending, on, the, availability, of, vegetation, the, plains, zebra, is, a, pioneer, grazer, mowing, down, the, upper, less, nutritious, grass, canopy, and, preparing, the, way, for, more, specialised, grazers, which, depend, on, shorter, and, more, nutritious, grasses, below, zebras, are, preyed, on, mainly, by, lions, leopards, cheetahs, spotted, hyenas, brown, hyenas, and, wild, dogs, pose, less, of, a, threat, to, adults, biting, and, kicking, are, a, zebra, s, defense, tactics, when, threatened, by, lions, zebras, flee, and, when, caught, they, are, rarely, effective, in, fighting, off, the, big, cats, in, one, study, the, maximum, speed, of, a, zebra, was, found, to, be, 50, km, h, 31, mph, while, a, lion, was, measured, at, 74, km, h, 46, mph, zebras, do, not, escape, lions, by, speed, alone, but, by, sideways, turning, especially, when, the, cat, is, close, behind, with, smaller, predators, like, hyenas, and, dogs, zebras, may, act, more, aggressively, especially, in, defense, of, their, young, zebra, species, have, two, basic, social, structures, plains, and, mountain, zebras, live, in, stable, closed, family, groups, or, harems, consisting, of, one, stallion, several, mares, and, their, offspring, these, groups, have, their, own, home, ranges, which, overlap, and, they, tend, to, be, nomadic, stallions, form, and, expand, their, harems, by, recruiting, young, mares, from, their, natal, birth, harems, the, stability, of, the, group, remains, even, when, the, family, stallion, is, displaced, plains, zebras, groups, gather, into, large, herds, and, may, create, temporarily, stable, subgroups, within, a, herd, allowing, individuals, to, interact, with, those, outside, their, group, females, in, harems, can, spend, more, time, feeding, and, gain, protection, both, for, them, and, their, young, the, females, have, a, linear, dominance, hierarchy, with, the, high, ranking, females, being, the, ones, that, have, lived, in, the, group, longest, while, traveling, the, most, dominant, females, and, their, offspring, lead, the, group, followed, by, the, next, most, dominant, the, family, stallion, trails, behind, young, of, both, sexes, leave, their, natal, groups, as, they, mature, females, are, usually, herded, by, outside, males, to, become, part, of, their, harems, in, the, more, arid, living, gr, vy, s, zebras, adults, have, more, fluid, associations, and, adult, males, establish, large, territories, marked, by, dung, piles, and, mate, with, the, females, that, enter, them, grazing, and, drinking, areas, tend, to, be, separated, in, these, environments, and, the, most, dominant, males, establish, territories, near, watering, holes, which, attract, females, with, dependent, foals, and, those, who, simply, want, a, drink, while, less, dominant, males, control, territories, away, from, water, with, more, vegetation, and, only, attract, mares, without, foals, mares, may, travel, through, several, territories, but, remain, in, one, when, they, have, young, staying, in, a, territory, offers, a, female, protection, from, harassment, by, outside, males, as, well, as, access, to, resources, in, all, species, excess, males, gather, in, bachelor, groups, these, are, typically, young, males, that, are, not, yet, ready, to, establish, a, harem, or, territory, with, the, plains, zebra, the, oldest, males, are, the, most, dominant, and, group, membership, is, stable, bachelor, groups, tend, to, be, at, the, boundaries, of, herds, and, during, group, movements, the, bachelors, follow, behind, or, along, the, sides, mountain, zebra, bachelor, groups, may, also, include, young, females, that, have, left, their, natal, group, early, as, well, as, old, former, harem, males, a, territorial, gr, vy, s, zebra, stallion, may, allow, non, territorial, bachelors, in, their, territory, however, when, a, mare, in, oestrous, is, present, the, territorial, stallion, keeps, other, stallions, at, bay, bachelors, prepare, for, their, future, harem, roles, with, play, fights, and, greeting, challenge, rituals, which, make, up, most, of, their, activities, fights, between, males, usually, occur, over, mates, and, involve, biting, and, kicking, in, plains, zebra, stallions, fight, each, other, over, recently, matured, mares, to, bring, into, their, group, and, her, family, stallion, will, fight, off, other, males, trying, to, abduct, her, as, long, as, a, harem, stallion, is, healthy, he, is, not, usually, challenged, only, unhealthy, stallions, have, their, harems, taken, over, and, even, then, the, new, stallion, slowly, takes, over, peacefully, displacing, the, old, one, agonistic, behaviour, between, male, gr, vy, s, zebras, occurs, at, the, border, of, their, territories, zebras, produce, a, number, of, vocalisations, and, noises, the, plains, zebra, has, a, distinctive, barking, contact, call, heard, as, a, ha, a, ha, a, ha, or, kwa, ha, kaw, ha, ha, ha, the, mountain, zebra, may, produce, a, similar, sound, while, the, call, of, gr, vy, s, zebra, has, been, described, as, something, like, a, hippo, s, grunt, combined, with, a, donkey, s, wheeze, loud, snorting, and, rough, gasping, in, zebras, signals, alarm, squealing, is, usually, made, when, in, pain, but, can, also, be, heard, in, friendly, interactions, zebras, also, communicate, with, visual, displays, and, the, flexibility, of, their, lips, allows, them, to, make, complex, facial, expressions, visual, displays, also, consist, of, head, ear, and, tail, postures, a, zebra, may, signal, an, intention, to, kick, by, dropping, back, its, ears, and, whipping, its, tail, flattened, ears, bared, teeth, and, a, waving, head, may, be, used, as, threatening, gestures, by, stallions, individuals, may, greet, each, other, by, rubbing, and, sniffing, and, then, mutually, rub, their, cheeks, and, move, along, their, bodies, towards, each, other, s, genitals, to, sniff, they, then, may, caress, their, shoulders, against, each, other, and, lay, their, heads, on, one, another, this, greeting, usually, occurs, between, harem, or, territorial, males, or, among, bachelor, males, playing, plains, and, mountain, zebras, strengthen, their, social, bonds, with, grooming, members, of, a, harem, nibble, and, rake, along, the, neck, shoulder, and, back, with, their, teeth, and, lips, grooming, usually, occurs, between, mothers, and, foals, and, between, stallions, and, mares, grooming, establishes, social, rank, and, eases, aggressive, behaviour, although, gr, vy, s, zebras, generally, do, not, perform, social, grooming, among, plains, and, mountain, zebras, the, adult, females, mate, only, with, their, harem, stallion, while, in, gr, vy, s, zebras, mating, is, more, promiscuous, and, the, males, have, larger, testes, for, sperm, competition, female, zebras, have, five, to, ten, day, long, oestrous, cycles, physical, signs, include, a, swollen, everted, inside, out, labia, and, copious, flows, of, urine, and, mucus, upon, reaching, peak, oestrous, mares, spread, out, their, legs, lift, their, tails, and, open, their, mouths, when, in, the, presence, of, a, male, males, assess, the, female, s, reproductive, state, with, a, curled, lip, and, bared, teeth, flehmen, response, and, the, female, will, solicit, mating, by, backing, in, gestation, is, typically, around, a, year, a, few, days, to, a, month, later, mares, can, return, to, oestrus, in, harem, holding, species, oestrus, in, a, female, becomes, less, noticeable, to, outside, males, as, she, gets, older, hence, competition, for, older, females, is, virtually, nonexistent, usually, a, single, foal, is, born, which, is, capable, of, running, within, an, hour, of, birth, a, newborn, zebra, will, follow, anything, that, moves, so, new, mothers, prevent, other, mares, from, approaching, their, foals, as, they, become, more, familiar, with, the, mother, s, striping, pattern, smell, and, voice, at, a, few, weeks, old, foals, begin, to, graze, but, may, continue, to, nurse, for, eight, to, thirteen, months, living, in, an, arid, environment, gr, vy, s, zebras, have, longer, nursing, intervals, and, young, only, begin, to, drink, water, three, months, after, birth, in, plains, and, mountain, zebras, foals, are, cared, for, mostly, by, their, mothers, but, if, threatened, by, pack, hunting, hyenas, and, dogs, the, entire, group, works, together, to, protect, all, the, young, the, group, forms, a, protective, front, with, the, foals, in, the, centre, and, the, stallion, will, rush, at, predators, that, come, too, close, in, gr, vy, s, zebras, young, stay, in, kindergartens, when, their, mothers, leave, for, water, these, groups, are, tended, to, by, the, territorial, male, a, stallion, may, look, after, a, foal, in, his, territory, to, ensure, that, the, mother, stays, though, it, may, not, be, his, by, contrast, plains, zebra, stallions, are, generally, intolerant, of, foals, that, are, not, theirs, and, may, practice, infanticide, and, feticide, via, violence, to, the, pregnant, mare, with, their, distinctive, black, and, white, stripes, zebras, are, among, the, most, recognisable, mammals, they, have, been, associated, with, beauty, and, grace, with, naturalist, thomas, pennant, describing, them, in, 1781, as, the, most, elegant, of, quadrupeds, zebras, have, been, popular, in, photography, with, some, wildlife, photographers, describing, them, as, the, most, photogenic, animal, they, have, become, staples, in, children, s, stories, and, wildlife, themed, art, such, as, depictions, of, noah, s, ark, in, children, s, alphabet, books, the, animals, are, often, used, to, represent, the, letter, z, zebra, stripe, patterns, are, popularly, used, for, body, paintings, dress, furniture, and, architecture, zebras, have, been, featured, in, african, art, and, culture, for, millennia, they, are, depicted, in, rock, art, in, southern, africa, dating, from, 28, 000, to, 20, 000, years, ago, though, less, often, than, antelope, species, like, eland, how, the, zebra, got, its, stripes, has, been, the, subject, of, folk, tales, some, of, which, involve, it, being, scorched, by, fire, the, maasai, proverb, a, man, without, culture, is, like, a, zebra, without, stripes, has, become, popular, in, africa, the, san, people, connected, zebra, stripes, with, water, rain, and, lightning, and, water, spirits, were, conceived, of, having, these, markings, for, the, shona, people, the, zebra, is, a, totem, animal, and, is, glorified, in, a, poem, as, an, iridescent, and, glittering, creature, its, stripes, have, symbolised, the, union, of, male, and, female, and, at, the, ruined, city, of, great, zimbabwe, zebra, stripes, decorate, what, is, believed, to, be, a, domba, a, school, meant, to, prepare, girls, for, adulthood, in, the, shona, language, the, name, madhuve, means, woman, women, of, the, zebra, totem, and, is, a, name, for, girls, in, zimbabwe, the, plains, zebra, is, the, national, animal, of, botswana, and, zebras, have, been, depicted, on, stamps, during, colonial, and, post, colonial, africa, for, people, of, the, african, diaspora, the, zebra, represented, the, politics, of, race, and, identity, being, both, black, and, white, in, cultures, outside, of, its, range, the, zebra, has, been, thought, of, as, a, more, exotic, alternative, to, the, horse, the, comic, book, character, sheena, queen, of, the, jungle, is, depicted, riding, a, zebra, and, explorer, osa, johnson, was, photographed, riding, one, the, film, racing, stripes, features, a, captive, zebra, ostracised, from, the, horses, and, ends, up, being, ridden, by, a, rebellious, girl, zebras, have, been, featured, as, characters, in, animated, films, like, khumba, the, lion, king, and, the, madagascar, films, and, television, series, such, as, zou, zebras, have, been, popular, subjects, for, abstract, modernist, and, surrealist, artists, such, art, includes, christopher, wood, s, zebra, and, parachute, lucian, freud, s, the, painter, s, room, and, quince, on, a, blue, table, and, the, various, paintings, of, mary, fedden, and, sidney, nolan, victor,
