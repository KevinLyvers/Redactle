homeopathy, or, homoeopathy, is, a, pseudoscientific, system, of, alternative, medicine, it, was, conceived, in, 1796, by, the, german, physician, samuel, hahnemann, its, practitioners, called, homeopaths, or, homeopathic, physicians, believe, that, a, substance, that, causes, symptoms, of, a, disease, in, healthy, people, can, cure, similar, symptoms, in, sick, people, this, doctrine, is, called, similia, similibus, curentur, or, like, cures, like, homeopathic, preparations, are, termed, remedies, and, are, made, using, homeopathic, dilution, in, this, process, the, selected, substance, is, repeatedly, diluted, until, the, final, product, is, chemically, indistinguishable, from, the, diluent, often, not, even, a, single, molecule, of, the, original, substance, can, be, expected, to, remain, in, the, product, between, each, dilution, homeopaths, may, hit, and, or, shake, the, product, claiming, this, makes, the, diluent, remember, the, original, substance, after, its, removal, practitioners, claim, that, such, preparations, upon, oral, intake, can, treat, or, cure, disease, all, relevant, scientific, knowledge, about, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and, biology, contradicts, homeopathy, homeopathic, remedies, are, typically, biochemically, inert, and, have, no, effect, on, any, known, disease, its, theory, of, disease, centered, around, principles, hahnemann, termed, miasms, is, inconsistent, with, subsequent, identification, of, viruses, and, bacteria, as, causes, of, disease, clinical, trials, have, been, conducted, and, generally, demonstrated, no, objective, effect, from, homeopathic, preparations, 206, the, fundamental, implausibility, of, homeopathy, as, well, as, a, lack, of, demonstrable, effectiveness, has, led, to, it, being, characterized, within, the, scientific, and, medical, communities, as, quackery, and, fraud, homeopathy, achieved, its, greatest, popularity, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, introduced, to, the, united, states, in, 1825, and, the, first, american, homeopathic, school, opened, in, 1835, throughout, the, 19th, century, dozens, of, homeopathic, institutions, appeared, in, europe, and, the, united, states, during, this, period, homeopathy, was, able, to, appear, relatively, successful, as, other, forms, of, treatment, could, be, harmful, and, ineffective, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, practice, began, to, wane, with, the, last, exclusively, homeopathic, medical, school, in, the, united, states, closing, in, 1920, during, the, 1970s, homeopathy, made, a, significant, comeback, with, sales, of, some, homeopathic, products, increasing, tenfold, the, trend, corresponded, with, the, rise, of, the, new, age, movement, and, may, be, in, part, due, to, chemophobia, an, irrational, aversion, to, synthetic, chemicals, and, the, longer, consultation, times, homeopathic, practitioners, provided, in, the, 21st, century, a, series, of, meta, analyses, have, shown, that, the, therapeutic, claims, of, homeopathy, lack, scientific, justification, as, a, result, national, and, international, bodies, have, recommended, the, withdrawal, of, government, funding, for, homeopathy, in, healthcare, national, bodies, from, australia, the, united, kingdom, switzerland, and, france, as, well, as, the, european, academies, science, advisory, council, and, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, have, all, concluded, that, homeopathy, is, ineffective, and, recommended, against, the, practice, receiving, any, further, funding, the, national, health, service, in, england, no, longer, provides, funding, for, homeopathic, remedies, and, asked, the, department, of, health, to, add, homeopathic, remedies, to, the, list, of, forbidden, prescription, items, france, removed, funding, in, 2021, while, spain, has, also, announced, moves, to, ban, homeopathy, and, other, pseudotherapies, from, health, centers, homeopathy, was, created, in, 1796, by, samuel, hahnemann, hahnemann, rejected, the, mainstream, medicine, of, the, late, 18th, century, as, irrational, and, inadvisable, because, it, was, largely, ineffective, and, often, harmful, he, advocated, the, use, of, single, drugs, at, lower, doses, and, promoted, an, immaterial, vitalistic, view, of, how, living, organisms, function, the, term, homeopathy, was, coined, by, hahnemann, and, first, appeared, in, print, in, 1807, he, also, coined, the, expression, allopathic, medicine, which, was, used, to, pejoratively, refer, to, traditional, western, medicine, hahnemann, conceived, of, homeopathy, while, translating, a, medical, treatise, by, the, scottish, physician, and, chemist, william, cullen, into, german, being, sceptical, of, cullen, s, theory, that, cinchona, cured, malaria, because, it, was, bitter, hahnemann, ingested, some, bark, specifically, to, investigate, what, would, happen, he, experienced, fever, shivering, and, joint, pain, symptoms, similar, to, those, of, malaria, itself, from, this, hahnemann, came, to, believe, that, all, effective, drugs, produce, symptoms, in, healthy, individuals, similar, to, those, of, the, diseases, that, they, treat, this, led, to, the, name, homeopathy, which, comes, from, the, greek, h, moios, like, and, p, thos, suffering, the, doctrine, that, those, drugs, are, effective, which, produce, symptoms, similar, to, the, symptoms, caused, by, the, diseases, they, treat, called, the, law, of, similars, was, expressed, by, hahnemann, with, the, latin, phrase, similia, similibus, curentur, or, like, cures, like, hahnemann, s, law, of, similars, is, unproven, and, does, not, derive, from, the, scientific, method, an, account, of, the, effects, of, eating, cinchona, bark, noted, by, oliver, wendell, holmes, published, in, 1861, failed, to, reproduce, the, symptoms, hahnemann, reported, 128, subsequent, scientific, work, showed, that, cinchona, cures, malaria, because, it, contains, quinine, which, kills, the, plasmodium, falciparum, parasite, that, causes, the, disease, the, mechanism, of, action, is, unrelated, to, hahnemann, s, ideas, hahnemann, began, to, test, what, effects, various, substances, may, produce, in, humans, a, procedure, later, called, homeopathic, proving, these, tests, required, subjects, to, test, the, effects, of, ingesting, substances, by, recording, all, their, symptoms, as, well, as, the, ancillary, conditions, under, which, they, appeared, he, published, a, collection, of, provings, in, 1805, and, a, second, collection, of, 65, preparations, appeared, in, his, book, materia, medica, pura, 1810, as, hahnemann, believed, that, large, doses, of, drugs, that, caused, similar, symptoms, would, only, aggravate, illness, he, advocated, for, extreme, dilutions, a, technique, was, devised, for, making, dilutions, that, hahnemann, claimed, would, preserve, the, substance, s, therapeutic, properties, while, removing, its, harmful, effects, hahnemann, believed, that, this, process, enhanced, the, spirit, like, medicinal, powers, of, the, crude, substances, he, gathered, and, published, an, overview, of, his, new, medical, system, in, his, book, the, organon, of, the, healing, art, 1810, with, a, sixth, edition, published, in, 1921, that, homeopaths, still, use, today, in, the, organon, hahnemann, introduced, the, concept, of, miasms, as, the, infectious, principles, underlying, chronic, disease, and, as, peculiar, morbid, derangement, of, vital, force, hahnemann, associated, each, miasm, with, specific, diseases, and, thought, that, initial, exposure, to, miasms, causes, local, symptoms, such, as, skin, or, venereal, diseases, his, assertion, was, that, if, these, symptoms, were, suppressed, by, medication, the, cause, went, deeper, and, began, to, manifest, itself, as, diseases, of, the, internal, organs, homeopathy, maintains, that, treating, diseases, by, directly, alleviating, their, symptoms, as, is, sometimes, done, in, conventional, medicine, is, ineffective, because, all, disease, can, generally, be, traced, to, some, latent, deep, seated, underlying, chronic, or, inherited, tendency, the, underlying, imputed, miasm, still, remains, and, deep, seated, ailments, can, be, corrected, only, by, removing, the, deeper, disturbance, of, the, vital, force, hahnemann, s, hypotheses, for, miasms, originally, presented, only, three, local, symptoms, psora, the, itch, syphilis, venereal, disease, or, sycosis, fig, wart, disease, of, these, the, most, important, was, psora, described, as, being, related, to, any, itching, diseases, of, the, skin, and, was, claimed, to, be, the, foundation, of, many, further, disease, conditions, hahnemann, believed, it, to, be, the, cause, of, such, diseases, as, epilepsy, cancer, jaundice, deafness, and, cataracts, since, hahnemann, s, time, other, miasms, have, been, proposed, some, replacing, illnesses, previously, attributed, to, the, psora, including, tuberculosis, and, cancer, miasms, hahnemann, s, miasm, theory, remains, disputed, and, controversial, within, homeopathy, even, in, modern, times, the, theory, of, miasms, has, been, criticized, as, an, explanation, developed, to, preserve, the, system, of, homeopathy, in, the, face, of, treatment, failures, and, for, being, inadequate, to, cover, the, many, hundreds, of, sorts, of, diseases, as, well, as, for, failing, to, explain, disease, predispositions, as, well, as, genetics, environmental, factors, and, the, unique, disease, history, of, each, patient, 148, 9, homeopathy, achieved, its, greatest, popularity, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, introduced, to, the, united, states, in, 1825, by, hans, birch, gram, a, student, of, hahnemann, the, first, homeopathic, school, in, the, united, states, opened, in, 1835, and, the, american, institute, of, homeopathy, was, established, in, 1844, throughout, the, 19th, century, dozens, of, homeopathic, institutions, appeared, in, europe, and, the, united, states, and, by, 1900, there, were, 22, homeopathic, colleges, and, 15, 000, practitioners, in, the, united, states, because, medical, practice, of, the, time, relied, on, treatments, which, were, often, ineffective, and, harmful, patients, of, homeopaths, often, had, better, outcomes, than, those, being, treated, by, medical, practitioners, though, ineffective, homeopathic, preparations, are, rarely, detrimental, thus, users, are, less, likely, to, be, harmed, by, the, treatment, that, is, supposed, to, be, helping, them, the, relative, success, of, homeopathy, in, the, 19th, century, may, have, led, to, the, abandonment, of, the, ineffective, and, harmful, treatments, of, bloodletting, and, purging, and, begun, the, move, towards, more, effective, science, based, medicine, one, reason, for, the, growing, popularity, of, homeopathy, was, its, apparent, success, in, treating, people, suffering, from, infectious, disease, epidemics, during, 19th, century, epidemics, of, diseases, such, as, cholera, death, rates, in, homeopathic, hospitals, were, often, lower, than, in, conventional, hospitals, where, the, treatments, used, at, the, time, were, often, harmful, and, did, little, or, nothing, to, combat, the, diseases, even, during, its, rise, in, popularity, homeopathy, was, criticized, by, scientists, and, physicians, sir, john, forbes, physician, to, queen, victoria, said, in, 1843, that, the, extremely, small, doses, of, homeopathy, were, regularly, derided, as, useless, and, considered, it, an, outrage, to, human, reason, james, young, simpson, said, in, 1853, of, the, highly, diluted, drugs, no, poison, however, strong, or, powerful, the, billionth, or, decillionth, of, which, would, in, the, least, degree, affect, a, man, or, harm, a, fly, nineteenth, century, american, physician, and, author, oliver, wendell, holmes, was, also, a, vocal, critic, of, homeopathy, and, published, an, essay, entitled, hom, opathy, and, its, kindred, delusions, 1842, the, members, of, the, french, homeopathic, society, observed, in, 1867, that, some, leading, homeopaths, of, europe, not, only, were, abandoning, the, practice, of, administering, infinitesimal, doses, but, were, also, no, longer, defending, it, the, last, school, in, the, united, states, exclusively, teaching, homeopathy, closed, in, 1920, according, to, academics, paul, u, unschuld, and, edzard, ernst, the, nazi, regime, in, germany, was, fond, of, homeopathy, and, spent, large, sums, of, money, on, researching, its, mechanisms, but, without, gaining, a, positive, result, unschuld, also, states, that, homeopathy, never, subsequently, took, root, in, the, united, states, but, remained, more, deeply, established, in, european, thinking, in, the, united, states, the, food, drug, and, cosmetic, act, of, 1938, sponsored, by, royal, copeland, a, senator, from, new, york, and, homeopathic, physician, recognized, homeopathic, preparations, as, drugs, in, the, 1950s, there, were, only, 75, solely, homeopathic, practitioners, in, the, u, s, by, the, mid, to, late, 1970s, homeopathy, made, a, significant, comeback, and, the, sales, of, some, homeopathic, companies, increased, tenfold, some, homeopaths, credit, the, revival, to, greek, homeopath, george, vithoulkas, who, conducted, a, great, deal, of, research, to, update, the, scenarios, and, refine, the, theories, and, practice, of, homeopathy, in, the, 1970s, but, ernst, and, simon, singh, consider, it, to, be, linked, to, the, rise, of, the, new, age, movement, bruce, hood, has, argued, that, the, increased, popularity, of, homeopathy, in, recent, times, may, be, due, to, the, comparatively, long, consultations, practitioners, are, willing, to, give, their, patients, and, to, a, preference, for, natural, products, which, people, think, are, the, basis, of, homeopathic, preparations, towards, the, end, of, the, century, opposition, to, homeopathy, began, to, increase, again, with, william, t, jarvis, the, president, of, the, national, council, against, health, fraud, saying, that, homeopathy, is, a, fraud, perpetrated, on, the, public, with, the, government, s, blessing, thanks, to, the, abuse, of, political, power, of, sen, royal, s, copeland, since, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, a, series, of, meta, analyses, have, further, shown, that, the, therapeutic, claims, of, homeopathy, lack, scientific, justification, this, had, led, to, a, decrease, or, suspension, of, funding, by, many, governments, in, a, 2010, report, the, science, and, technology, committee, of, the, united, kingdom, house, of, commons, recommended, that, homeopathy, should, no, longer, receive, national, health, service, nhs, funding, due, its, lack, of, scientific, credibility, nhs, funding, for, homeopathy, ceased, in, 2017, they, also, asked, the, department, of, health, in, the, uk, to, add, homeopathic, remedies, to, the, list, of, forbidden, prescription, items, in, 2015, the, national, health, and, medical, research, council, of, australia, found, that, there, are, no, health, conditions, for, which, there, is, reliable, evidence, that, homeopathy, is, effective, the, federal, government, only, ended, up, accepting, three, of, the, 45, recommendations, made, by, the, 2018, review, of, pharmacy, remuneration, and, regulation, the, same, year, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, held, a, hearing, requesting, public, comment, on, the, regulation, of, homeopathic, drugs, in, 2017, the, fda, announced, it, would, strengthen, regulation, of, homeopathic, products, the, american, non, profit, center, for, inquiry, cfi, filed, a, lawsuit, in, 2018, against, the, cvs, pharmacy, for, consumer, fraud, over, its, sale, of, homeopathic, medicines, it, claimed, that, cvs, was, selling, homeopathic, products, on, an, easier, to, obtain, basis, than, standard, medication, in, 2019, cfi, brought, a, similar, lawsuit, against, walmart, for, committing, wide, scale, consumer, fraud, and, endangering, the, health, of, its, customers, through, its, sale, and, marketing, of, homeopathic, medicines, they, also, conducted, a, survey, in, which, they, found, consumers, felt, ripped, off, when, informed, of, the, lack, of, evidence, for, the, efficacy, of, homeopathic, remedies, such, as, those, sold, by, walmart, and, cvs, in, 2021, the, french, healthcare, minister, phased, out, social, security, reimbursements, for, homeopathic, drugs, france, has, long, had, a, stronger, belief, in, the, virtues, of, homeopathic, drugs, than, many, other, countries, and, the, world, s, biggest, manufacturer, of, alternative, medicine, drugs, boiron, is, located, in, that, country, spain, has, also, announced, moves, to, ban, homeopathy, and, other, pseudotherapies, in, 2016, the, university, of, barcelona, cancelled, its, master, s, degree, in, homeopathy, citing, lack, of, scientific, basis, after, advice, from, the, spanish, ministry, of, health, shortly, afterwards, the, university, of, valencia, announced, the, elimination, of, its, masters, in, homeopathy, homeopathic, preparations, are, referred, to, as, homeopathic, remedies, practitioners, rely, on, two, types, of, reference, when, prescribing, materia, medica, and, repertories, a, homeopathic, materia, medica, is, a, collection, of, drug, pictures, organized, alphabetically, a, homeopathic, repertory, is, a, quick, reference, version, of, the, materia, medica, that, indexes, the, symptoms, and, then, the, associated, remedies, for, each, in, both, cases, different, compilers, may, dispute, particular, inclusions, in, the, references, the, first, symptomatic, homeopathic, materia, medica, was, arranged, by, hahnemann, the, first, homeopathic, repertory, was, georg, jahr, s, symptomenkodex, published, in, german, in, 1835, and, translated, into, english, as, the, repertory, to, the, more, characteristic, symptoms, of, materia, medica, in, 1838, this, version, was, less, focused, on, disease, categories, and, was, the, forerunner, to, later, works, by, james, tyler, kent, there, are, over, 118, repertories, published, in, english, with, kent, s, being, one, of, the, most, used, homeopaths, generally, begin, with, a, consultation, which, can, be, a, 10, 15, minute, appointment, or, last, for, over, an, hour, where, the, patient, describes, their, medical, history, the, patient, describes, the, modalities, or, if, their, symptoms, change, depending, on, the, weather, and, other, external, factors, the, practitioner, also, solicits, information, on, mood, likes, and, dislikes, physical, mental, and, emotional, states, life, circumstances, and, any, physical, or, emotional, illnesses, this, information, also, called, the, symptom, picture, is, matched, to, the, drug, picture, in, the, materia, medica, or, repertory, and, used, to, determine, the, appropriate, homeopathic, remedies, in, classical, homeopathy, the, practitioner, attempts, to, match, a, single, preparation, to, the, totality, of, symptoms, the, simlilum, while, clinical, homeopathy, involves, combinations, of, preparations, based, on, the, illness, s, symptoms, homeopathy, uses, animal, plant, mineral, and, synthetic, substances, in, its, preparations, generally, referring, to, them, using, latin, names, examples, include, arsenicum, album, arsenic, oxide, natrum, muriaticum, sodium, chloride, or, table, salt, lachesis, muta, the, venom, of, the, bushmaster, snake, opium, and, thyroidinum, thyroid, hormone, homeopaths, say, this, is, to, ensure, accuracy, in, the, usa, the, common, name, must, be, displayed, although, the, latin, one, can, also, be, present, homeopathic, pills, are, made, from, an, inert, substance, often, sugars, typically, lactose, upon, which, a, drop, of, liquid, homeopathic, preparation, is, placed, and, allowed, to, evaporate, isopathy, is, a, therapy, derived, from, homeopathy, in, which, the, preparations, come, from, diseased, or, pathological, products, such, as, fecal, urinary, and, respiratory, discharges, blood, and, tissue, they, are, called, nosodes, from, the, greek, nosos, disease, with, preparations, made, from, healthy, specimens, being, termed, sarcodes, many, so, called, homeopathic, vaccines, are, a, form, of, isopathy, tautopathy, is, a, form, of, isopathy, where, the, preparations, are, composed, of, drugs, or, vaccines, that, a, person, has, consumed, in, the, past, in, the, belief, that, this, can, reverse, the, supposed, lingering, damage, caused, by, the, initial, use, there, is, no, convincing, scientific, evidence, for, isopathy, as, an, effective, method, of, treatment, some, modern, homeopaths, use, preparations, they, call, imponderables, because, they, do, not, originate, from, a, substance, but, some, other, phenomenon, presumed, to, have, been, captured, by, alcohol, or, lactose, examples, include, x, rays, and, sunlight, another, derivative, is, electrohomeopathy, where, an, electric, bio, energy, of, therapeutic, value, is, supposedly, extracted, from, plants, popular, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, electrohomeopathy, is, extremely, pseudo, scientific, in, 2012, the, allahabad, high, court, in, uttar, pradesh, india, handed, down, a, decree, stating, that, electrohomeopathy, was, quackery, and, no, longer, recognized, it, as, a, system, of, medicine, other, minority, practices, include, paper, preparations, in, which, the, terms, for, substances, and, dilutions, are, written, on, pieces, of, paper, and, either, pinned, to, the, patients, clothing, put, in, their, pockets, or, placed, under, glasses, of, water, that, are, then, given, to, the, patients, radionics, the, use, of, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, radio, waves, can, also, be, used, to, manufacture, preparations, such, practices, have, been, strongly, criticized, by, classical, homeopaths, as, unfounded, speculative, and, verging, upon, magic, and, superstition, flower, preparations, are, produced, by, placing, flowers, in, water, and, exposing, them, to, sunlight, the, most, famous, of, these, are, the, bach, flower, remedies, which, were, developed, by, edward, bach, hahnemann, claimed, that, undiluted, doses, caused, reactions, sometimes, dangerous, ones, and, thus, that, preparations, be, given, at, the, lowest, possible, dose, a, solution, that, is, more, dilute, is, described, as, having, a, higher, potency, and, thus, are, claimed, to, be, stronger, and, deeper, acting, the, general, method, of, dilution, is, serial, dilution, where, solvent, is, added, to, part, of, the, previous, mixture, but, the, korsakovian, method, may, also, be, used, in, the, korsakovian, method, the, vessel, in, which, the, preparations, are, manufactured, is, emptied, refilled, with, solvent, with, the, volume, of, fluid, adhering, to, the, walls, of, the, vessel, deemed, sufficient, for, the, new, batch, 270, the, korsakovian, method, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, k, on, the, label, of, a, homeopathic, preparation, another, method, is, fluxion, which, dilutes, the, substance, by, continuously, passing, water, through, the, vial, insoluble, solids, such, as, granite, diamond, and, platinum, are, diluted, by, grinding, them, with, lactose, trituration, 23, three, main, logarithmic, dilution, scales, are, in, regular, use, in, homeopathy, hahnemann, created, the, centesimal, or, c, scale, diluting, a, substance, by, a, factor, of, 100, at, each, stage, there, is, also, a, decimal, dilution, scale, notated, as, x, or, d, in, which, the, preparation, is, diluted, by, a, factor, of, 10, at, each, stage, the, centesimal, scale, was, favoured, by, hahnemann, for, most, of, his, life, although, in, his, last, ten, years, hahnemann, developed, a, quintamillesimal, q, scale, which, diluted, the, drug, 1, part, in, 50, 000, a, 2c, dilution, works, out, to, one, part, of, the, original, substance, in, 10, 000, parts, of, the, solution, in, standard, chemistry, this, produces, a, substance, with, a, concentration, of, 0, 01, volume, volume, percentage, a, 6c, dilution, ends, up, with, the, original, substance, diluted, by, a, factor, of, 100, 6, one, part, in, one, trillion, the, end, product, is, usually, so, diluted, as, to, be, indistinguishable, from, the, diluent, pure, water, sugar, or, alcohol, the, greatest, dilution, reasonably, likely, to, contain, at, least, one, molecule, of, the, original, substance, is, approximately, 12c, hahnemann, advocated, dilutions, of, 1, part, to, 10, 60, or, 30c, hahnemann, regularly, used, dilutions, of, up, to, 30c, but, opined, that, there, must, be, a, limit, to, the, matter, 322, to, counter, the, reduced, potency, at, high, dilutions, he, formed, the, view, that, vigorous, shaking, by, striking, on, an, elastic, surface, a, process, termed, succussion, was, necessary, homeopaths, are, unable, to, agree, on, the, number, and, force, of, strikes, needed, and, there, is, no, way, that, the, claimed, results, of, succussion, can, be, tested, 67, 69, critics, of, homeopathy, commonly, emphasize, the, dilutions, involved, in, homeopathy, using, analogies, one, mathematically, correct, example, is, that, a, 12c, solution, is, equivalent, to, a, pinch, of, salt, in, both, the, north, and, south, atlantic, oceans, one, third, of, a, drop, of, some, original, substance, diluted, into, all, the, water, on, earth, would, produce, a, preparation, with, a, concentration, of, about, 13c, robert, l, park, points, out, that, a, 200c, dilution, of, duck, liver, marketed, under, the, name, oscillococcinum, would, require, 10, 320, universes, worth, of, molecules, to, contain, just, one, original, molecule, in, the, final, substance, the, high, dilutions, characteristically, used, are, often, considered, to, be, the, most, controversial, and, implausible, aspect, of, homeopathy, homeopaths, claim, that, they, can, determine, the, properties, of, their, preparations, by, following, a, method, which, they, call, proving, as, performed, by, hahnemann, provings, involved, administering, various, preparations, to, healthy, volunteers, the, volunteers, were, then, observed, often, for, months, at, a, time, they, were, made, to, keep, extensive, journals, detailing, all, of, their, symptoms, at, specific, times, throughout, the, day, they, were, forbidden, from, consuming, coffee, tea, spices, or, wine, for, the, duration, of, the, experiment, playing, chess, was, also, prohibited, because, hahnemann, considered, it, to, be, too, exciting, though, they, were, allowed, to, drink, beer, and, encouraged, to, exercise, in, moderation, at, first, hahnemann, used, undiluted, doses, for, provings, but, he, later, advocated, provings, with, preparations, at, a, 30c, dilution, and, most, modern, provings, are, carried, out, using, ultra, dilute, preparations, provings, are, claimed, to, have, been, important, in, the, development, of, the, clinical, trial, due, to, their, early, use, of, simple, control, groups, systematic, and, quantitative, procedures, and, some, of, the, first, application, of, statistics, in, medicine, the, lengthy, records, of, self, experimentation, by, homeopaths, have, occasionally, proven, useful, in, the, development, of, modern, drugs, for, example, evidence, that, nitroglycerin, might, be, useful, as, a, treatment, for, angina, was, discovered, by, looking, through, homeopathic, provings, though, homeopaths, themselves, never, used, it, for, that, purpose, at, that, time, the, first, recorded, provings, were, published, by, hahnemann, in, his, 1796, essay, on, a, new, principle, his, fragmenta, de, viribus, 1805, contained, the, results, of, 27, provings, and, his, 1810, materia, medica, pura, contained, 65, for, james, tyler, kent, s, 1905, lectures, on, homoeopathic, materia, medica, 217, preparations, underwent, provings, and, newer, substances, are, continually, added, to, contemporary, versions, though, the, proving, process, has, superficial, similarities, with, clinical, trials, it, is, fundamentally, different, in, that, the, process, is, subjective, not, blinded, and, modern, provings, are, unlikely, to, use, pharmacologically, active, levels, of, the, substance, under, proving, as, early, as, 1842, oliver, holmes, had, noted, that, provings, were, impossibly, vague, and, the, purported, effect, was, not, repeatable, among, different, subjects, outside, of, the, alternative, medicine, community, scientists, have, long, considered, homeopathy, a, sham, or, a, pseudoscience, and, the, medical, community, regards, it, as, quackery, there, is, an, overall, absence, of, sound, statistical, evidence, of, therapeutic, efficacy, which, is, consistent, with, the, lack, of, any, biologically, plausible, pharmacological, agent, or, mechanism, proponents, argue, that, homeopathic, medicines, must, work, by, some, as, yet, undefined, biophysical, mechanism, no, homeopathic, preparation, has, been, shown, to, be, different, from, placebo, the, lack, of, convincing, scientific, evidence, supporting, its, efficacy, and, its, use, of, preparations, without, active, ingredients, have, led, to, characterizations, of, homeopathy, as, pseudoscience, and, quackery, or, in, the, words, of, a, 1998, medical, review, placebo, therapy, at, best, and, quackery, at, worst, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, considers, homeopathy, a, dangerous, pseudoscience, that, does, not, work, and, urges, people, to, treat, homeopathy, on, a, par, with, magic, the, chief, medical, officer, for, england, dame, sally, davies, has, stated, that, homeopathic, preparations, are, rubbish, and, do, not, serve, as, anything, more, than, placebos, in, 2013, mark, walport, the, uk, government, chief, scientific, adviser, and, head, of, the, government, office, for, science, said, homeopathy, is, nonsense, it, is, non, science, his, predecessor, john, beddington, also, said, that, homeopathy, has, no, underpinning, of, scientific, basis, and, is, being, fundamentally, ignored, by, the, government, jack, killen, acting, deputy, director, of, the, national, center, for, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, says, homeopathy, goes, beyond, current, understanding, of, chemistry, and, physics, he, adds, there, is, to, my, knowledge, no, condition, for, which, homeopathy, has, been, proven, to, be, an, effective, treatment, ben, goldacre, says, that, homeopaths, who, misrepresent, scientific, evidence, to, a, scientifically, illiterate, public, have, walled, themselves, off, from, academic, medicine, and, critique, has, been, all, too, often, met, with, avoidance, rather, than, argument, homeopaths, often, prefer, to, ignore, meta, analyses, in, favour, of, cherry, picked, positive, results, such, as, by, promoting, a, particular, observational, study, one, which, goldacre, describes, as, little, more, than, a, customer, satisfaction, survey, as, if, it, were, more, informative, than, a, series, of, randomized, controlled, trials, in, an, article, entitled, should, we, maintain, an, open, mind, about, homeopathy, published, in, the, american, journal, of, medicine, michael, baum, and, edzard, ernst, writing, to, other, physicians, wrote, that, homeopathy, is, among, the, worst, examples, of, faith, based, medicine, these, axioms, are, not, only, out, of, line, with, scientific, facts, but, also, directly, opposed, to, them, if, homeopathy, is, correct, much, of, physics, chemistry, and, pharmacology, must, be, incorrect, the, exceedingly, low, concentration, of, homeopathic, preparations, which, often, lack, even, a, single, molecule, of, the, diluted, substance, has, been, the, basis, of, questions, about, the, effects, of, the, preparations, since, the, 19th, century, the, laws, of, chemistry, give, this, dilution, limit, which, is, related, to, the, avogadro, number, as, being, roughly, equal, to, 12c, homeopathic, dilutions, 1, part, in, 10, 24, james, randi, and, the, 10, 23, campaign, groups, have, highlighted, the, lack, of, active, ingredients, by, taking, large, overdoses, none, of, the, hundreds, of, demonstrators, in, the, uk, australia, new, zealand, canada, and, the, us, were, injured, and, no, one, was, cured, of, anything, either, modern, advocates, of, homeopathy, have, proposed, a, concept, of, water, memory, according, to, which, water, remembers, the, substances, mixed, in, it, and, transmits, the, effect, of, those, substances, when, consumed, this, concept, is, inconsistent, with, the, current, understanding, of, matter, and, water, memory, has, never, been, demonstrated, to, have, any, detectable, effect, biological, or, otherwise, existence, of, a, pharmacological, effect, in, the, absence, of, any, true, active, ingredient, is, inconsistent, with, the, law, of, mass, action, and, the, observed, dose, response, relationships, characteristic, of, therapeutic, drugs, homeopaths, contend, that, their, methods, produce, a, therapeutically, active, preparation, selectively, including, only, the, intended, substance, though, in, reality, any, water, will, have, been, in, contact, with, millions, of, different, substances, throughout, its, history, and, homeopaths, cannot, account, for, the, selected, homeopathic, substance, being, isolated, as, a, special, case, in, their, process, practitioners, also, hold, that, higher, dilutions, produce, stronger, medicinal, effects, this, idea, is, also, inconsistent, with, observed, dose, response, relationships, where, effects, are, dependent, on, the, concentration, of, the, active, ingredient, in, the, body, some, contend, that, the, phenomenon, of, hormesis, may, support, the, idea, of, dilution, increasing, potency, but, the, dose, response, relationship, outside, the, zone, of, hormesis, declines, with, dilution, as, normal, and, nonlinear, pharmacological, effects, do, not, provide, any, credible, support, for, homeopathy, no, individual, homeopathic, preparation, has, been, unambiguously, shown, by, research, to, be, different, from, placebo, the, methodological, quality, of, the, early, primary, research, was, low, with, problems, such, as, weaknesses, in, study, design, and, reporting, small, sample, size, and, selection, bias, since, better, quality, trials, have, become, available, the, evidence, for, efficacy, of, homeopathy, preparations, has, diminished, the, highest, quality, trials, indicate, that, the, preparations, themselves, exert, no, intrinsic, effect, 206, a, review, conducted, in, 2010, of, all, the, pertinent, studies, of, best, evidence, produced, by, the, cochrane, collaboration, concluded, that, this, evidence, fails, to, demonstrate, that, homeopathic, medicines, have, effects, beyond, placebo, in, 2009, the, united, kingdom, s, house, of, commons, science, and, technology, committee, concluded, that, there, was, no, compelling, evidence, of, effect, other, than, placebo, the, australian, national, health, and, medical, research, council, completed, a, comprehensive, review, of, the, effectiveness, of, homeopathic, preparations, in, 2015, in, which, it, concluded, that, there, were, no, health, conditions, for, which, there, was, reliable, evidence, that, homeopathy, was, effective, the, european, academies, science, advisory, council, easac, published, its, official, analysis, in, 2017, finding, a, lack, of, evidence, that, homeopathic, products, are, effective, and, raising, concerns, about, quality, control, in, contrast, a, 2011, book, was, published, purportedly, financed, by, the, swiss, government, that, concluded, that, homeopathy, was, effective, and, cost, efficient, although, hailed, by, proponents, as, proof, that, homeopathy, works, it, was, found, to, be, scientifically, logically, and, ethically, flawed, with, most, authors, having, a, conflict, of, interest, the, swiss, federal, office, of, public, health, later, released, a, statement, saying, the, book, was, published, without, the, consent, of, the, swiss, government, meta, analyses, essential, tools, to, summarize, evidence, of, therapeutic, efficacy, and, systematic, reviews, have, found, that, the, methodological, quality, in, the, majority, of, randomized, trials, in, homeopathy, have, shortcomings, and, that, such, trials, were, generally, of, lower, quality, than, trials, of, conventional, medicine, a, major, issue, has, been, publication, bias, where, positive, results, are, more, likely, to, be, published, in, journals, this, has, been, particularly, marked, in, alternative, medicine, journals, where, few, of, the, published, articles, just, 5, during, the, year, 2000, tend, to, report, null, results, a, systematic, review, of, the, available, systematic, reviews, confirmed, in, 2002, that, higher, quality, trials, tended, to, have, less, positive, results, and, found, no, convincing, evidence, that, any, homeopathic, preparation, exerts, clinical, effects, different, from, placebo, the, same, conclusion, was, also, reached, in, 2005, in, a, meta, analysis, published, in, the, lancet, a, 2017, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, found, that, the, most, reliable, evidence, did, not, support, the, effectiveness, of, non, individualized, homeopathy, health, organizations, including, the, uk, s, national, health, service, the, american, medical, association, the, faseb, and, the, national, health, and, medical, research, council, of, australia, have, issued, statements, saying, that, there, is, no, good, quality, evidence, that, homeopathy, is, effective, as, a, treatment, for, any, health, condition, in, 2009, world, health, organization, official, mario, raviglione, criticized, the, use, of, homeopathy, to, treat, tuberculosis, similarly, another, who, spokesperson, argued, there, was, no, evidence, homeopathy, would, be, an, effective, treatment, for, diarrhoea, they, warned, against, the, use, of, homeopathy, for, serious, conditions, such, as, depression, hiv, and, malaria, the, american, college, of, medical, toxicology, and, the, american, academy, of, clinical, toxicology, recommend, that, no, one, use, homeopathic, treatment, for, disease, or, as, a, preventive, health, measure, these, organizations, report, that, no, evidence, exists, that, homeopathic, treatment, is, effective, but, that, there, is, evidence, that, using, these, treatments, produces, harm, and, can, bring, indirect, health, risks, by, delaying, conventional, treatment, while, some, articles, have, suggested, that, homeopathic, solutions, of, high, dilution, can, have, statistically, significant, effects, on, organic, processes, including, the, growth, of, grain, and, enzyme, reactions, such, evidence, is, disputed, since, attempts, to, replicate, them, have, failed, in, 2001, and, 2004, madeleine, ennis, published, a, number, of, studies, that, reported, that, homeopathic, dilutions, of, histamine, exerted, an, effect, on, the, activity, of, basophils, in, response, to, the, first, of, these, studies, horizon, aired, a, programme, in, which, british, scientists, attempted, to, replicate, ennis, results, they, were, unable, to, do, so, a, 2007, systematic, review, of, high,

believe, that, experimental, data, have, been, uncritically, assessed, and, their, imperfections, inadequately, reported, the, provision, of, homeopathic, preparations, has, been, described, as, unethical, michael, baum, professor, emeritus, of, surgery, and, visiting, professor, of, medical, humanities, at, university, college, london, ucl, has, described, homeopathy, as, a, cruel, deception, edzard, ernst, the, first, professor, of, complementary, medicine, in, the, united, kingdom, and, a, former, homeopathic, practitioner, has, expressed, his, concerns, about, pharmacists, who, violate, their, ethical, code, by, failing, to, provide, customers, with, necessary, and, relevant, information, about, the, true, nature, of, the, homeopathic, products, they, advertise, and, sell, in, 2013, the, uk, advertising, standards, authority, concluded, that, the, society, of, homeopaths, were, targeting, vulnerable, ill, people, and, discouraging, the, use, of, essential, medical, treatment, while, making, misleading, claims, of, efficacy, for, homeopathic, products, in, 2015, the, federal, court, of, australia, imposed, penalties, on, a, homeopathic, company, for, making, false, or, misleading, statements, about, the, efficacy, of, the, whooping, cough, vaccine, and, recommending, homeopathic, remedies, as, an, alternative, a, 2000, review, by, homeopaths, reported, that, homeopathic, preparations, are, unlikely, to, provoke, severe, adverse, reactions, in, 2012, a, systematic, review, evaluating, evidence, of, homeopathy, s, possible, adverse, effects, concluded, that, homeopathy, has, the, potential, to, harm, patients, and, consumers, in, both, direct, and, indirect, ways, a, 2016, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, found, that, in, homeopathic, clinical, trials, adverse, effects, were, reported, among, the, patients, who, received, homeopathy, about, as, often, as, they, were, reported, among, patients, who, received, placebo, or, conventional, medicine, some, homeopathic, preparations, involve, poisons, such, as, belladonna, arsenic, and, poison, ivy, in, rare, cases, the, original, ingredients, are, present, at, detectable, levels, this, may, be, due, to, improper, preparation, or, intentional, low, dilution, serious, adverse, effects, such, as, seizures, and, death, have, been, reported, or, associated,

effective, treatment, critics, have, cited, cases, of, patients, failing, to, receive, proper, treatment, for, diseases, that, could, have, been, easily, managed, with, conventional, medicine, and, who, have, died, as, a, result, they, have, also, condemned, the, marketing, practice, of, criticizing, and, downplaying, the, effectiveness, of, medicine, homeopaths, claim, that, use, of,
