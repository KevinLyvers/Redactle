radiation, therapy, or, radiotherapy, rt, rtx, or, xrt, is, a, treatment, using, ionizing, radiation, generally, provided, as, part, of, cancer, therapy, to, either, kill, or, control, the, growth, of, malignant, cells, it, is, normally, delivered, by, a, linear, particle, accelerator, radiation, therapy, may, be, curative, in, a, number, of, types, of, cancer, if, they, are, localized, to, one, area, of, the, body, and, have, not, spread, to, other, parts, it, may, also, be, used, as, part, of, adjuvant, therapy, to, prevent, tumor, recurrence, after, surgery, to, remove, a, primary, malignant, tumor, for, example, early, stages, of, breast, cancer, radiation, therapy, is, synergistic, with, chemotherapy, and, has, been, used, before, during, and, after, chemotherapy, in, susceptible, cancers, the, subspecialty, of, oncology, concerned, with, radiotherapy, is, called, radiation, oncology, a, physician, who, practices, in, this, subspecialty, is, a, radiation, oncologist, radiation, therapy, is, commonly, applied, to, the, cancerous, tumor, because, of, its, ability, to, control, cell, growth, ionizing, radiation, works, by, damaging, the, dna, of, cancerous, tissue, leading, to, cellular, death, to, spare, normal, tissues, such, as, skin, or, organs, which, radiation, must, pass, through, to, treat, the, tumor, shaped, radiation, beams, are, aimed, from, several, angles, of, exposure, to, intersect, at, the, tumor, providing, a, much, larger, absorbed, dose, there, than, in, the, surrounding, healthy, tissue, besides, the, tumor, itself, the, radiation, fields, may, also, include, the, draining, lymph, nodes, if, they, are, clinically, or, radiologically, involved, with, the, tumor, or, if, there, is, thought, to, be, a, risk, of, subclinical, malignant, spread, it, is, necessary, to, include, a, margin, of, normal, tissue, around, the, tumor, to, allow, for, uncertainties, in, daily, set, up, and, internal, tumor, motion, these, uncertainties, can, be, caused, by, internal, movement, for, example, respiration, and, bladder, filling, and, movement, of, external, skin, marks, relative, to, the, tumor, position, radiation, oncology, is, the, medical, specialty, concerned, with, prescribing, radiation, and, is, distinct, from, radiology, the, use, of, radiation, in, medical, imaging, and, diagnosis, radiation, may, be, prescribed, by, a, radiation, oncologist, with, intent, to, cure, or, for, adjuvant, therapy, it, may, also, be, used, as, palliative, treatment, where, cure, is, not, possible, and, the, aim, is, for, local, disease, control, or, symptomatic, relief, or, as, therapeutic, treatment, where, the, therapy, has, survival, benefit, and, can, be, curative, it, is, also, common, to, combine, radiation, therapy, with, surgery, chemotherapy, hormone, therapy, immunotherapy, or, some, mixture, of, the, four, most, common, cancer, types, can, be, treated, with, radiation, therapy, in, some, way, the, precise, treatment, intent, curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant, therapeutic, or, palliative, will, depend, on, the, tumor, type, location, and, stage, as, well, as, the, general, health, of, the, patient, total, body, irradiation, tbi, is, a, radiation, therapy, technique, used, to, prepare, the, body, to, receive, a, bone, marrow, transplant, brachytherapy, in, which, a, radioactive, source, is, placed, inside, or, next, to, the, area, requiring, treatment, is, another, form, of, radiation, therapy, that, minimizes, exposure, to, healthy, tissue, during, procedures, to, treat, cancers, of, the, breast, prostate, and, other, organs, radiation, therapy, has, several, applications, in, non, malignant, conditions, such, as, the, treatment, of, trigeminal, neuralgia, acoustic, neuromas, severe, thyroid, eye, disease, pterygium, pigmented, villonodular, synovitis, and, prevention, of, keloid, scar, growth, vascular, restenosis, and, heterotopic, ossification, the, use, of, radiation, therapy, in, non, malignant, conditions, is, limited, partly, by, worries, about, the, risk, of, radiation, induced, cancers, it, is, estimated, that, half, of, the, us, 1, 2m, invasive, cancer, cases, diagnosed, in, 2022, received, radiation, therapy, in, their, treatment, program, different, cancers, respond, to, radiation, therapy, in, different, ways, the, response, of, a, cancer, to, radiation, is, described, by, its, radiosensitivity, highly, radiosensitive, cancer, cells, are, rapidly, killed, by, modest, doses, of, radiation, these, include, leukemias, most, lymphomas, and, germ, cell, tumors, the, majority, of, epithelial, cancers, are, only, moderately, radiosensitive, and, require, a, significantly, higher, dose, of, radiation, 60, 70, gy, to, achieve, a, radical, cure, some, types, of, cancer, are, notably, radioresistant, that, is, much, higher, doses, are, required, to, produce, a, radical, cure, than, may, be, safe, in, clinical, practice, renal, cell, cancer, and, melanoma, are, generally, considered, to, be, radioresistant, but, radiation, therapy, is, still, a, palliative, option, for, many, patients, with, metastatic, melanoma, combining, radiation, therapy, with, immunotherapy, is, an, active, area, of, investigation, and, has, shown, some, promise, for, melanoma, and, other, cancers, it, is, important, to, distinguish, the, radiosensitivity, of, a, particular, tumor, which, to, some, extent, is, a, laboratory, measure, from, the, radiation, curability, of, a, cancer, in, actual, clinical, practice, for, example, leukemias, are, not, generally, curable, with, radiation, therapy, because, they, are, disseminated, through, the, body, lymphoma, may, be, radically, curable, if, it, is, localized, to, one, area, of, the, body, similarly, many, of, the, common, moderately, radioresponsive, tumors, are, routinely, treated, with, curative, doses, of, radiation, therapy, if, they, are, at, an, early, stage, for, example, non, melanoma, skin, cancer, head, and, neck, cancer, breast, cancer, non, small, cell, lung, cancer, cervical, cancer, anal, cancer, and, prostate, cancer, with, the, exception, of, oligometastatic, disease, metastatic, cancers, are, incurable, with, radiation, therapy, because, it, is, not, possible, to, treat, the, whole, body, modern, radiation, therapy, relies, on, a, ct, scan, to, identify, the, tumor, and, surrounding, normal, structures, and, to, perform, dose, calculations, for, the, creation, of, a, complex, radiation, treatment, plan, the, patient, receives, small, skin, marks, to, guide, the, placement, of, treatment, fields, patient, positioning, is, crucial, at, this, stage, as, the, patient, will, have, to, be, placed, in, an, identical, position, during, each, treatment, many, patient, positioning, devices, have, been, developed, for, this, purpose, including, masks, and, cushions, which, can, be, molded, to, the, patient, image, guided, radiation, therapy, is, a, method, that, uses, imaging, to, correct, for, positional, errors, of, each, treatment, session, the, response, of, a, tumor, to, radiation, therapy, is, also, related, to, its, size, due, to, complex, radiobiology, very, large, tumors, respond, less, well, to, radiation, than, smaller, tumors, or, microscopic, disease, various, strategies, are, used, to, overcome, this, effect, the, most, common, technique, is, surgical, resection, prior, to, radiation, therapy, this, is, most, commonly, seen, in, the, treatment, of, breast, cancer, with, wide, local, excision, or, mastectomy, followed, by, adjuvant, radiation, therapy, another, method, is, to, shrink, the, tumor, with, neoadjuvant, chemotherapy, prior, to, radical, radiation, therapy, a, third, technique, is, to, enhance, the, radiosensitivity, of, the, cancer, by, giving, certain, drugs, during, a, course, of, radiation, therapy, examples, of, radiosensitizing, drugs, include, cisplatin, nimorazole, and, cetuximab, the, impact, of, radiotherapy, varies, between, different, types, of, cancer, and, different, groups, for, example, for, breast, cancer, after, breast, conserving, surgery, radiotherapy, has, been, found, to, halve, the, rate, at, which, the, disease, recurs, in, pancreatic, cancer, radiotherapy, has, increased, survival, times, for, inoperable, tumors, radiation, therapy, rt, is, in, itself, painless, many, low, dose, palliative, treatments, for, example, radiation, therapy, to, bony, metastases, cause, minimal, or, no, side, effects, although, short, term, pain, flare, up, can, be, experienced, in, the, days, following, treatment, due, to, oedema, compressing, nerves, in, the, treated, area, higher, doses, can, cause, varying, side, effects, during, treatment, acute, side, effects, in, the, months, or, years, following, treatment, long, term, side, effects, or, after, re, treatment, cumulative, side, effects, the, nature, severity, and, longevity, of, side, effects, depends, on, the, organs, that, receive, the, radiation, the, treatment, itself, type, of, radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent, chemotherapy, and, the, patient, serious, radiation, complications, may, occur, in, 5, of, rt, cases, acute, near, immediate, or, sub, acute, 2, to, 3, months, post, rt, radiation, side, effects, may, develop, after, 50, gy, rt, dosing, late, or, delayed, radiation, injury, 6, months, to, decades, may, develop, after, 65, gy, most, side, effects, are, predictable, and, expected, side, effects, from, radiation, are, usually, limited, to, the, area, of, the, patient, s, body, that, is, under, treatment, side, effects, are, dose, dependent, for, example, higher, doses, of, head, and, neck, radiation, can, be, associated, with, cardiovascular, complications, thyroid, dysfunction, and, pituitary, axis, dysfunction, modern, radiation, therapy, aims, to, reduce, side, effects, to, a, minimum, and, to, help, the, patient, understand, and, deal, with, side, effects, that, are, unavoidable, the, main, side, effects, reported, are, fatigue, and, skin, irritation, like, a, mild, to, moderate, sun, burn, the, fatigue, often, sets, in, during, the, middle, of, a, course, of, treatment, and, can, last, for, weeks, after, treatment, ends, the, irritated, skin, will, heal, but, may, not, be, as, elastic, as, it, was, before, late, side, effects, occur, months, to, years, after, treatment, and, are, generally, limited, to, the, area, that, has, been, treated, they, are, often, due, to, damage, of, blood, vessels, and, connective, tissue, cells, many, late, effects, are, reduced, by, fractionating, treatment, into, smaller, parts, cumulative, effects, from, this, process, should, not, be, confused, with, long, term, effects, when, short, term, effects, have, disappeared, and, long, term, effects, are, subclinical, reirradiation, can, still, be, problematic, these, doses, are, calculated, by, the, radiation, oncologist, and, many, factors, are, taken, into, account, before, the, subsequent, radiation, takes, place, during, the, first, two, weeks, after, fertilization, radiation, therapy, is, lethal, but, not, teratogenic, high, doses, of, radiation, during, pregnancy, induce, anomalies, impaired, growth, and, intellectual, disability, and, there, may, be, an, increased, risk, of, childhood, leukemia, and, other, tumors, in, the, offspring, in, males, previously, having, undergone, radiotherapy, there, appears, to, be, no, increase, in, genetic, defects, or, congenital, malformations, in, their, children, conceived, after, therapy, however, the, use, of, assisted, reproductive, technologies, and, micromanipulation, techniques, might, increase, this, risk, hypopituitarism, commonly, develops, after, radiation, therapy, for, sellar, and, parasellar, neoplasms, extrasellar, brain, tumors, head, and, neck, tumors, and, following, whole, body, irradiation, for, systemic, malignancies, 40, 50, of, children, treated, for, childhood, cancer, develop, some, endocrine, side, effect, radiation, induced, hypopituitarism, mainly, affects, growth, hormone, and, gonadal, hormones, in, contrast, adrenocorticotrophic, hormone, acth, and, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, deficiencies, are, the, least, common, among, people, with, radiation, induced, hypopituitarism, changes, in, prolactin, secretion, is, usually, mild, and, vasopressin, deficiency, appears, to, be, very, rare, as, a, consequence, of, radiation, delayed, tissue, injury, with, impaired, wound, healing, capability, often, develops, after, receiving, doses, in, excess, of, 65, gy, a, diffuse, injury, pattern, due, to, the, external, beam, radiotherapy, s, holographic, isodosing, occurs, while, the, targeted, tumor, receives, the, majority, of, radiation, healthy, tissue, at, incremental, distances, from, the, center, of, the, tumor, are, also, irradiated, in, a, diffuse, pattern, due, to, beam, divergence, these, wounds, demonstrate, progressive, proliferative, endarteritis, inflamed, arterial, linings, that, disrupt, the, tissue, s, blood, supply, such, tissue, ends, up, chronically, hypoxic, fibrotic, and, without, an, adequate, nutrient, and, oxygen, supply, surgery, of, previously, irradiated, tissue, has, a, very, high, failure, rate, e, g, women, who, have, received, radiation, for, breast, cancer, develop, late, effect, chest, wall, tissue, fibrosis, and, hypovascularity, making, successful, reconstruction, and, healing, difficult, if, not, impossible, there, are, rigorous, procedures, in, place, to, minimise, the, risk, of, accidental, overexposure, of, radiation, therapy, to, patients, however, mistakes, do, occasionally, occur, for, example, the, radiation, therapy, machine, therac, 25, was, responsible, for, at, least, six, accidents, between, 1985, and, 1987, where, patients, were, given, up, to, one, hundred, times, the, intended, dose, two, people, were, killed, directly, by, the, radiation, overdoses, from, 2005, to, 2010, a, hospital, in, missouri, overexposed, 76, patients, most, with, brain, cancer, during, a, five, year, period, because, new, radiation, equipment, had, been, set, up, incorrectly, although, medical, errors, are, exceptionally, rare, radiation, oncologists, medical, physicists, and, other, members, of, the, radiation, therapy, treatment, team, are, working, to, eliminate, them, in, 2010, the, american, society, for, radiation, oncology, astro, launched, a, safety, initiative, called, target, safely, that, among, other, things, aimed, to, record, errors, nationwide, so, that, doctors, can, learn, from, each, and, every, mistake, and, prevent, them, from, recurring, astro, also, publishes, a, list, of, questions, for, patients, to, ask, their, doctors, about, radiation, safety, to, ensure, every, treatment, is, as, safe, as, possible, radiation, therapy, is, used, to, treat, early, stage, dupuytren, s, disease, and, ledderhose, disease, when, dupuytren, s, disease, is, at, the, nodules, and, cords, stage, or, fingers, are, at, a, minimal, deformation, stage, of, less, than, 10, degrees, then, radiation, therapy, is, used, to, prevent, further, progress, of, the, disease, radiation, therapy, is, also, used, post, surgery, in, some, cases, to, prevent, the, disease, continuing, to, progress, low, doses, of, radiation, are, used, typically, three, gray, of, radiation, for, five, days, with, a, break, of, three, months, followed, by, another, phase, of, three, gray, of, radiation, for, five, days, radiation, therapy, works, by, damaging, the, dna, of, cancer, cells, and, can, cause, them, to, undergo, mitotic, catastrophe, this, dna, damage, is, caused, by, one, of, two, types, of, energy, photon, or, charged, particle, this, damage, is, either, direct, or, indirect, ionization, of, the, atoms, which, make, up, the, dna, chain, indirect, ionization, happens, as, a, result, of, the, ionization, of, water, forming, free, radicals, notably, hydroxyl, radicals, which, then, damage, the, dna, in, photon, therapy, most, of, the, radiation, effect, is, through, free, radicals, cells, have, mechanisms, for, repairing, single, strand, dna, damage, and, double, stranded, dna, damage, however, double, stranded, dna, breaks, are, much, more, difficult, to, repair, and, can, lead, to, dramatic, chromosomal, abnormalities, and, genetic, deletions, targeting, double, stranded, breaks, increases, the, probability, that, cells, will, undergo, cell, death, cancer, cells, are, generally, less, differentiated, and, more, stem, cell, like, they, reproduce, more, than, most, healthy, differentiated, cells, and, have, a, diminished, ability, to, repair, sub, lethal, damage, single, strand, dna, damage, is, then, passed, on, through, cell, division, damage, to, the, cancer, cells, dna, accumulates, causing, them, to, die, or, reproduce, more, slowly, one, of, the, major, limitations, of, photon, radiation, therapy, is, that, the, cells, of, solid, tumors, become, deficient, in, oxygen, solid, tumors, can, outgrow, their, blood, supply, causing, a, low, oxygen, state, known, as, hypoxia, oxygen, is, a, potent, radiosensitizer, increasing, the, effectiveness, of, a, given, dose, of, radiation, by, forming, dna, damaging, free, radicals, tumor, cells, in, a, hypoxic, environment, may, be, as, much, as, 2, to, 3, times, more, resistant, to, radiation, damage, than, those, in, a, normal, oxygen, environment, much, research, has, been, devoted, to, overcoming, hypoxia, including, the, use, of, high, pressure, oxygen, tanks, hyperthermia, therapy, heat, therapy, which, dilates, blood, vessels, to, the, tumor, site, blood, substitutes, that, carry, increased, oxygen, hypoxic, cell, radiosensitizer, drugs, such, as, misonidazole, and, metronidazole, and, hypoxic, cytotoxins, tissue, poisons, such, as, tirapazamine, newer, research, approaches, are, currently, being, studied, including, preclinical, and, clinical, investigations, into, the, use, of, an, oxygen, diffusion, enhancing, compound, such, as, trans, sodium, crocetinate, as, a, radiosensitizer, charged, particles, such, as, protons, and, boron, carbon, and, neon, ions, can, cause, direct, damage, to, cancer, cell, dna, through, high, let, linear, energy, transfer, and, have, an, antitumor, effect, independent, of, tumor, oxygen, supply, because, these, particles, act, mostly, via, direct, energy, transfer, usually, causing, double, stranded, dna, breaks, due, to, their, relatively, large, mass, protons, and, other, charged, particles, have, little, lateral, side, scatter, in, the, tissue, the, beam, does, not, broaden, much, stays, focused, on, the, tumor, shape, and, delivers, small, dose, side, effects, to, surrounding, tissue, they, also, more, precisely, target, the, tumor, using, the, bragg, peak, effect, see, proton, therapy, for, a, good, example, of, the, different, effects, of, intensity, modulated, radiation, therapy, imrt, vs, charged, particle, therapy, this, procedure, reduces, damage, to, healthy, tissue, between, the, charged, particle, radiation, source, and, the, tumor, and, sets, a, finite, range, for, tissue, damage, after, the, tumor, has, been, reached, in, contrast, imrt, s, use, of, uncharged, particles, causes, its, energy, to, damage, healthy, cells, when, it, exits, the, body, this, exiting, damage, is, not, therapeutic, can, increase, treatment, side, effects, and, increases, the, probability, of, secondary, cancer, induction, this, difference, is, very, important, in, cases, where, the, close, proximity, of, other, organs, makes, any, stray, ionization, very, damaging, example, head, and, neck, cancers, this, x, ray, exposure, is, especially, bad, for, children, due, to, their, growing, bodies, and, while, depending, on, a, multitude, of, factors, they, are, around, 10, times, more, sensitive, to, developing, secondary, malignancies, after, radiotherapy, as, compared, to, adults, the, amount, of, radiation, used, in, photon, radiation, therapy, is, measured, in, grays, gy, and, varies, depending, on, the, type, and, stage, of, cancer, being, treated, for, curative, cases, the, typical, dose, for, a, solid, epithelial, tumor, ranges, from, 60, to, 80, gy, while, lymphomas, are, treated, with, 20, to, 40, gy, preventive, adjuvant, doses, are, typically, around, 45, 60, gy, in, 1, 8, 2, gy, fractions, for, breast, head, and, neck, cancers, many, other, factors, are, considered, by, radiation, oncologists, when, selecting, a, dose, including, whether, the, patient, is, receiving, chemotherapy, patient, comorbidities, whether, radiation, therapy, is, being, administered, before, or, after, surgery, and, the, degree, of, success, of, surgery, delivery, parameters, of, a, prescribed, dose, are, determined, during, treatment, planning, part, of, dosimetry, treatment, planning, is, generally, performed, on, dedicated, computers, using, specialized, treatment, planning, software, depending, on, the, radiation, delivery, method, several, angles, or, sources, may, be, used, to, sum, to, the, total, necessary, dose, the, planner, will, try, to, design, a, plan, that, delivers, a, uniform, prescription, dose, to, the, tumor, and, minimizes, dose, to, surrounding, healthy, tissues, in, radiation, therapy, three, dimensional, dose, distributions, may, be, evaluated, using, the, dosimetry, technique, known, as, gel, dosimetry, the, total, dose, is, fractionated, spread, out, over, time, for, several, important, reasons, fractionation, allows, normal, cells, time, to, recover, while, tumor, cells, are, generally, less, efficient, in, repair, between, fractions, fractionation, also, allows, tumor, cells, that, were, in, a, relatively, radio, resistant, phase, of, the, cell, cycle, during, one, treatment, to, cycle, into, a, sensitive, phase, of, the, cycle, before, the, next, fraction, is, given, similarly, tumor, cells, that, were, chronically, or, acutely, hypoxic, and, therefore, more, radioresistant, may, reoxygenate, between, fractions, improving, the, tumor, cell, kill, fractionation, regimens, are, individualised, between, different, radiation, therapy, centers, and, even, between, individual, doctors, in, north, america, australia, and, europe, the, typical, fractionation, schedule, for, adults, is, 1, 8, to, 2, gy, per, day, five, days, a, week, in, some, cancer, types, prolongation, of, the, fraction, schedule, over, too, long, can, allow, for, the, tumor, to, begin, repopulating, and, for, these, tumor, types, including, head, and, neck, and, cervical, squamous, cell, cancers, radiation, treatment, is, preferably, completed, within, a, certain, amount, of, time, for, children, a, typical, fraction, size, may, be, 1, 5, to, 1, 8, gy, per, day, as, smaller, fraction, sizes, are, associated, with, reduced, incidence, and, severity, of, late, onset, side, effects, in, normal, tissues, in, some, cases, two, fractions, per, day, are, used, near, the, end, of, a, course, of, treatment, this, schedule, known, as, a, concomitant, boost, regimen, or, hyperfractionation, is, used, on, tumors, that, regenerate, more, quickly, when, they, are, smaller, in, particular, tumors, in, the, head, and, neck, demonstrate, this, behavior, patients, receiving, palliative, radiation, to, treat, uncomplicated, painful, bone, metastasis, should, not, receive, more, than, a, single, fraction, of, radiation, a, single, treatment, gives, comparable, pain, relief, and, morbidity, outcomes, to, multiple, fraction, treatments, and, for, patients, with, limited, life, expectancy, a, single, treatment, is, best, to, improve, patient, comfort, one, fractionation, schedule, that, is, increasingly, being, used, and, continues, to, be, studied, is, hypofractionation, this, is, a, radiation, treatment, in, which, the, total, dose, of, radiation, is, divided, into, large, doses, typical, doses, vary, significantly, by, cancer, type, from, 2, 2, gy, fraction, to, 20, gy, fraction, the, latter, being, typical, of, stereotactic, treatments, stereotactic, ablative, body, radiotherapy, or, sabr, also, known, as, sbrt, or, stereotactic, body, radiotherapy, for, subcranial, lesions, or, srs, stereotactic, radiosurgery, for, intracranial, lesions, the, rationale, of, hypofractionation, is, to, reduce, the, probability, of, local, recurrence, by, denying, clonogenic, cells, the, time, they, require, to, reproduce, and, also, to, exploit, the, radiosensitivity, of, some, tumors, in, particular, stereotactic, treatments, are, intended, to, destroy, clonogenic, cells, by, a, process, of, ablation, i, e, the, delivery, of, a, dose, intended, to, destroy, clonogenic, cells, directly, rather, than, to, interrupt, the, process, of, clonogenic, cell, division, repeatedly, apoptosis, as, in, routine, radiotherapy, different, cancer, types, have, different, radiation, sensitivity, while, predicting, the, sensitivity, based, on, genomic, or, proteomic, analyses, of, biopsy, samples, has, proven, challenging, the, predictions, of, radiation, effect, on, individual, patients, from, genomic, signatures, of, intrinsic, cellular, radiosensitivity, have, been, shown, to, associate, with, clinical, outcome, an, alternative, approach, to, genomics, and, proteomics, was, offered, by, the, discovery, that, radiation, protection, in, microbes, is, offered, by, non, enzymatic, complexes, of, manganese, and, small, organic, metabolites, the, content, and, variation, of, manganese, measurable, by, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, were, found, to, be, good, predictors, of, radiosensitivity, and, this, finding, extends, also, to, human, cells, an, association, was, confirmed, between, total, cellular, manganese, contents, and, their, variation, and, clinically, inferred, radioresponsiveness, in, different, tumor, cells, a, finding, that, may, be, useful, for, more, precise, radiodosages, and, improved, treatment, of, cancer, patients, historically, the, three, main, divisions, of, radiation, therapy, are, the, differences, relate, to, the, position, of, the, radiation, source, external, is, outside, the, body, brachytherapy, uses, sealed, radioactive, sources, placed, precisely, in, the, area, under, treatment, and, systemic, radioisotopes, are, given, by, infusion, or, oral, ingestion, brachytherapy, can, use, temporary, or, permanent, placement, of, radioactive, sources, the, temporary, sources, are, usually, placed, by, a, technique, called, afterloading, in, afterloading, a, hollow, tube, or, applicator, is, placed, surgically, in, the, organ, to, be, treated, and, the, sources, are, loaded, into, the, applicator, after, the, applicator, is, implanted, this, minimizes, radiation, exposure, to, health, care, personnel, particle, therapy, is, a, special, case, of, external, beam, radiation, therapy, where, the, particles, are, protons, or, heavier, ions, a, review, of, radiation, therapy, randomised, clinical, trials, from, 2018, to, 2021, found, many, practice, changing, data, and, new, concepts, that, emerge, from, rcts, identifying, techniques, that, improve, the, therapeutic, ratio, techniques, that, lead, to, more, tailored, treatments, stressing, the, importance, of, patient, satisfaction, and, identifying, areas, that, require, further, study, the, following, three, sections, refer, to, treatment, using, x, rays, historically, conventional, external, beam, radiation, therapy, 2dxrt, was, delivered, via, two, dimensional, beams, using, kilovoltage, therapy, x, ray, units, medical, linear, accelerators, that, generate, high, energy, x, rays, or, with, machines, that, were, similar, to, a, linear, accelerator, in, appearance, but, used, a, sealed, radioactive, source, like, the, one, shown, above, 2dxrt, mainly, consists, of, a, single, beam, of, radiation, delivered, to, the, patient, from, several, directions, often, front, or, back, and, both, sides, conventional, refers, to, the, way, the, treatment, is, planned, or, simulated, on, a, specially, calibrated, diagnostic, x, ray, machine, known, as, a, simulator, because, it, recreates, the, linear, accelerator, actions, or, sometimes, by, eye, and, to, the, usually, well, established, arrangements, of, the, radiation, beams, to, achieve, a, desired, plan, the, aim, of, simulation, is, to, accurately, target, or, localize, the, volume, which, is, to, be, treated, this, technique, is, well, established, and, is, generally, quick, and, reliable, the, worry, is, that, some, high, dose, treatments, may, be, limited, by, the, radiation, toxicity, capacity, of, healthy, tissues, which, lie, close, to, the, target, tumor, volume, an, example, of, this, problem, is, seen, in, radiation, of, the, prostate, gland, where, the, sensitivity, of, the, adjacent, rectum, limited, the, dose, which, could, be, safely, prescribed, using, 2dxrt, planning, to, such, an, extent, that, tumor, control, may, not, be, easily, achievable, prior, to, the, invention, of, the, ct, physicians, and, physicists, had, limited, knowledge, about, the, true, radiation, dosage, delivered, to, both, cancerous, and, healthy, tissue, for, this, reason, 3, dimensional, conformal, radiation, therapy, has, become, the, standard, treatment, for, almost, all, tumor, sites, more, recently, other, forms, of, imaging, are, used, including, mri, pet, spect, and, ultrasound, stereotactic, radiation, is, a, specialized, type, of, external, beam, radiation, therapy, it, uses, focused, radiation, beams, targeting, a, well, defined, tumor, using, extremely, detailed, imaging, scans, radiation, oncologists, perform, stereotactic, treatments, often, with, the, help, of, a, neurosurgeon, for, tumors, in, the, brain, or, spine, there, are, two, types, of, stereotactic, radiation, stereotactic, radiosurgery, srs, is, when, doctors, use, a, single, or, several, stereotactic, radiation, treatments, of, the, brain, or, spine, stereotactic, body, radiation, therapy, sbrt, refers, to, one, or, several, stereotactic, radiation, treatments, with, the, body, such, as, the, lungs, some, doctors, say, an, advantage, to, stereotactic, treatments, is, that, they, deliver, the, right, amount, of, radiation, to, the, cancer, in, a, shorter, amount, of, time, than, traditional, treatments, which, can, often, take, 6, to, 11, weeks, plus, treatments, are, given, with, extreme, accuracy, which, should, limit, the, effect, of, the, radiation, on, healthy, tissues, one, problem, with, stereotactic, treatments, is, that, they, are, only, suitable, for, certain, small, tumors, stereotactic, treatments, can, be, confusing, because, many, hospitals, call, the, treatments, by, the, name, of, the, manufacturer, rather, than, calling, it, srs, or, sbrt, brand, names, for, these, treatments, include, axesse, cyberknife, gamma, knife, novalis, primatom, synergy, x, knife, tomotherapy, trilogy, and, truebeam, this, list, changes, as, equipment, manufacturers, continue, to, develop, new, specialized, technologies, to, treat, cancers, the, planning, of, radiation, therapy, treatment, has, been, revolutionized, by, the, ability, to, delineate, tumors, and, adjacent, normal, structures, in, three, dimensions, using, specialized, ct, and, or, mri, scanners, and, planning, software, virtual, simulation, the, most, basic, form, of, planning, allows, more, accurate, placement, of, radiation, beams, than, is, possible, using, conventional, x, rays, where, soft, tissue, structures, are, often, difficult, to, assess, and, normal, tissues, difficult, to, protect, an, enhancement, of, virtual, simulation, is, 3, dimensional, conformal, radiation, therapy, 3dcrt, in, which, the, profile, of, each, radiation, beam, is, shaped, to, fit, the, profile, of, the, target, from, a, beam, s, eye, view, bev, using, a, multileaf, collimator, mlc, and, a, variable, number, of, beams, when, the, treatment, volume, conforms, to, the, shape, of, the, tumor, the, relative, toxicity, of, radiation, to, the, surrounding, normal, tissues, is, reduced, allowing, a, higher, dose, of, radiation, to, be, delivered, to, the, tumor, than, conventional, techniques, would, allow, intensity, modulated, radiation, therapy, imrt, is, an, advanced, type, of, high, precision, radiation, that, is, the, next, generation, of, 3dcrt, imrt, also, improves, the, ability, to, conform, the, treatment, volume, to, concave, tumor, shapes, for, example, when, the, tumor, is, wrapped, around, a, vulnerable, structure, such, as, the, spinal, cord, or, a, major, organ, or, blood, vessel, computer, controlled, x, ray, accelerators, distribute, precise, radiation, doses, to, malignant, tumors, or, specific, areas, within, the, tumor, the, pattern, of, radiation, delivery, is, determined, using, highly, tailored, computing, applications, to, perform, optimization, and, treatment, simulation, treatment, planning, the, radiation, dose, is, consistent, with, the, 3, d, shape, of, the, tumor, by, controlling, or, modulating, the, radiation, beam, s, intensity, the, radiation, dose, intensity, is, elevated, near, the, gross, tumor, volume, while, radiation, among, the, neighboring, normal, tissues, is, decreased, or, avoided, completely, this, results, in, better, tumor, targeting, lessened, side, effects, and, improved, treatment, outcomes, than, even, 3dcrt, 3dcrt, is, still, used, extensively, for, many, body, sites, but, the, use, of, imrt, is, growing, in, more, complicated, body, sites, such, as, cns, head, and, neck, prostate, breast, and, lung, unfortunately, imrt, is, limited, by, its, need, for, additional, time, from, experienced, medical, personnel, this, is, because, physicians, must, manually, delineate, the, tumors, one, ct, image, at, a, time, through, the, entire, disease, site, which, can, take, much, longer, than, 3dcrt, preparation, then, medical, physicists, and, dosimetrists, must, be, engaged, to, create, a, viable, treatment, plan, also, the, imrt, technology, has, only, been, used, commercially, since, the, late, 1990s, even, at, the, most, advanced, cancer, centers, so, radiation, oncologists, who, did, not, learn, it, as, part, of, their, residency, programs, must, find, additional, sources, of, education, before, implementing, imrt, proof, of, improved, survival, benefit, from, either, of, these, two, techniques, over, conventional, radiation, therapy, 2dxrt, is, growing, for, many, tumor, sites, but, the, ability, to, reduce, toxicity, is, generally, accepted, this, is, particularly, the, case, for, head, and, neck, cancers, in, a, series, of, pivotal, trials, performed, by, professor, christopher, nutting, of, the, royal, marsden, hospital, both, techniques, enable, dose, escalation, potentially, increasing, usefulness, there, has, been, some, concern, particularly, with, imrt, about, increased, exposure, of, normal, tissue, to, radiation, and, the, consequent, potential, for, secondary, malignancy, overconfidence, in, the, accuracy, of, imaging, may, increase, the, chance, of, missing, lesions, that, are, invisible, on, the, planning, scans, and, therefore, not, included, in, the, treatment, plan, or, that, move, between, or, during, a, treatment, for, example, due, to, respiration, or, inadequate, patient, immobilization, new, techniques, are, being, developed, to, better, control, this, uncertainty, for, example, real, time, imaging, combined, with, real, time, adjustment, of, the, therapeutic, beams, this, new, technology, is, called, image, guided, radiation, therapy, or, four, dimensional, radiation, therapy, another, technique, is, the, real, time, tracking, and, localization, of, one, or, more, small, implantable, electric, devices, implanted, inside, or, close, to, the, tumor, there, are, various, types, of, medical, implantable, devices, that, are, used, for, this, purpose, it, can, be, a, magnetic, transponder, which, senses, the, magnetic, field, generated, by, several, transmitting, coils, and, then, transmits, the, measurements, back, to, the, positioning, system, to, determine, the, location, the, implantable, device, can, also, be, a, small, wireless, transmitter, sending, out, an, rf, signal, which, then, will, be, received, by, a, sensor, array, and, used, for, localization, and, real, time, tracking, of, the, tumor, position, a, well, studied, issue, with, imrt, is, the, tongue, and, groove, effect, which, results, in, unwanted, underdosing, due, to, irradiating, through, extended, tongues, and, grooves, of, overlapping, mlc, multileaf, collimator, leaves, while, solutions, to, this, issue, have, been, developed, which, either, reduce, the, tg, effect, to, negligible, amounts, or, remove, it, completely, they, depend, upon, the, method, of, imrt, being, used, and, some, of, them, carry, costs, of, their, own, some, texts, distinguish, tongue, and, groove, error, from, tongue, or, groove, error, according, as, both, or, one, side, of, the, aperture, is, occluded, volumetric, modulated, arc, therapy, vmat, is, a, radiation, technique, introduced, in, 2007, which, can, achieve, highly, conformal, dose, distributions, on, target, volume, coverage, and, sparing, of, normal, tissues, the, specificity, of, this, technique, is, to, modify, three, parameters, during, the, treatment, vmat, delivers, radiation, by, rotating, gantry, usually, 360, rotating, fields, with, one, or, more, arcs, changing, speed, and, shape, of, the, beam, with, a, multileaf, collimator, mlc, sliding, window, system, of, moving, and, fluence, output, rate, dose, rate, of, the, medical, linear, accelerator, vmat, has, an, advantage, in, patient, treatment, compared, with, conventional, static, field, intensity, modulated, radiotherapy, imrt, of, reduced, radiation, delivery, times, comparisons, between, vmat, and, conventional, imrt, for, their, sparing, of, healthy, tissues, and, organs, at, risk, oar, depends, upon, the, cancer, type, in, the, treatment, of, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and, hypopharyngeal, carcinomas, vmat, provides, equivalent, or, better, protection, of, the, organ, at, risk, oar, in, the, treatment, of, prostate, cancer, the, oar, protection, result, is, mixed, with, some, studies, favoring, vmat, others, favoring, imrt, temporally, feathered, radiation, therapy, tfrt, is, a, radiation, technique, introduced, in, 2018, which, aims, to, use, the, inherent, non, linearities, in, normal, tissue, repair, to, allow, for, sparing, of, these, tissues, without, affecting, the, dose, delivered, to, the, tumor, the, application, of, this, technique, which, has, yet, to, be, automated, has, been, described, carefully, to, enhance, the, ability, of, departments, to, perform, it, and, in, 2021, it, was, reported, as, feasible, in, a, small, clinical, trial, though, its, efficacy, has, yet, to, be, formally, studied, automated, treatment, planning, has, become, an, integrated, part, of, radiotherapy, treatment, planning, there, are, in, general, two, approaches, of, automated, planning, 1, knowledge, based, planning, where, the, treatment, planning, system, has, a, library, of, high, quality, plans, from, which, it, can, predict, the, target, and, dose, volume, histogram, of, the, organ, at, risk, 2, the, other, approach, is, commonly, called, protocol, based, planning, where, the, treatment, planning, system, tried, to, mimic, an, experienced, treatment, planner, and, through, an, iterative, process, evaluates, the, plan, quality, from, on, the, basis, of, the, protocol, in, particle, therapy, proton, therapy, being, one, example, energetic, ionizing, particles, protons, or, carbon, ions, are, directed, at, the, target, tumor, the, dose, increases, while, the, particle, penetrates, the, tissue, up, to, a, maximum, the, bragg, peak, that, occurs, near, the, end, of, the, particle, s, range, and, it, then, drops, to, almost, zero, the, advantage, of, this, energy, deposition, profile, is, that, less, energy, is, deposited, into, the, healthy, tissue, surrounding, the, target, tissue, auger, therapy, at, makes, use, of, a, very, high, dose, of, ionizing, radiation, in, situ, that, provides, molecular, modifications, at, an, atomic, scale, at, differs, from, conventional, radiation, therapy, in, several, aspects, it, neither, relies, upon, radioactive, nuclei, to, cause, cellular, radiation, damage, at, a, cellular, dimension, nor, engages, multiple, external, pencil, beams, from, different, directions, to, zero, in, to, deliver, a, dose, to, the, targeted, area, with, reduced, dose, outside, the, targeted, tissue, organ, locations, instead, the, in, situ, delivery, of, a, very, high, dose, at, the, molecular, level, using, at, aims, for, in, situ, molecular, modifications, involving, molecular, breakages, and, molecular, re, arrangements, such, as, a, change, of, stacking, structures, as, well, as, cellular, metabolic, functions, related, to, the, said, molecule, structures, in, many, types, of, external, beam, radiotherapy, motion, can, negatively, impact, the, treatment, delivery, by, moving, target, tissue, out, of, or, other, healthy, tissue, into, the, intended, beam, path, some, form, of, patient, immobilisation, is, common, to, prevent, the, large, movements, of, the, body, during, treatment, however, this, cannot, prevent, all, motion, for, example, as, a, result, of, breathing, several, techniques, have, been, developed, to, account, for, motion, like, this, deep, inspiration, breath, hold, dibh, is, commonly, used, for, breast, treatments, where, it, is, important, to, avoid, irradiating, the, heart, in, dibh, the, patient, holds, their, breath, after, breathing, in, to, provide, a, stable, position, for, the, treatment, beam, to, be, turned, on, this, can, be, done, automatically, using, an, external, monitoring, system, such, as, a, spirometer, or, a, camera, and, markers, the, same, monitoring, techniques, as, well, as, 4dct, imaging, can, also, be, for, respiratory, gated, treatment, where, the, patient, breathes, freely, and, the, beam, is, only, engaged, at, certain, points, in, the, breathing, cycle, other, techniques, include, using, 4dct, imaging, to, plan, treatments, with, margins, that, account, for, motion, and, active, movement, of, the, treatment, couch, or, beam, to, follow, motion, contact, x, ray, brachytherapy, also, called, cxb, electronic, brachytherapy, or, the, papillon, technique, is, a, type, of, radiation, therapy, using, low, energy, 50, kvp, kilovoltage, x, rays, applied, directly, to, the, tumor, to, treat, rectal, cancer, the, process, involves, endoscopic, examination, first, to, identify, the, tumor, in, the, rectum, and, then, inserting, treatment, applicator, on, the, tumor, through, the, anus, into, the, rectum, and, placing, it, against, the, cancerous, tissue, finally, treatment, tube, is, inserted, into, the, applicator, to, deliver, high, doses, of, x, rays, 30gy, emitted, directly, onto, the, tumor, at, two, weekly, intervals, for, three, times, over, four, weeks, period, it, is, typically, used, for, treating, early, rectal, cancer, in, patients, who, may, not, be, candidates, for, surgery, a, 2015, nice, review, found, the, main, side, effect, to, be, bleeding, that, occurred, in, about, 38, of, cases, and, radiation, induced, ulcer, which, occurred, in, 27, of, cases, brachytherapy, is, delivered, by, placing, radiation, source, s, inside, or, next, to, the, area, requiring, treatment, brachytherapy, is, commonly, used, as, an, effective, treatment, for, cervical, prostate, breast, and, skin, cancer, and, can, also, be, used, to, treat, tumors, in, many, other, body, sites, in, brachytherapy, radiation, sources, are, precisely, placed, directly, at, the, site, of, the, cancerous, tumor, this, means, that, the, irradiation, only, affects, a, very, localized, area, exposure, to, radiation, of, healthy, tissues, further, away, from, the, sources, is, reduced, these, characteristics, of, brachytherapy, provide, advantages, over, external, beam, radiation, therapy, the, tumor, can, be, treated, with, very, high, doses, of, localized, radiation, whilst, reducing, the, probability, of, unnecessary, damage, to, surrounding, healthy, tissues, a, course, of, brachytherapy, can, often, be, completed, in, less, time, than, other, radiation, therapy, techniques, this, can, help, reduce, the, chance, of, surviving, cancer, cells, dividing, and, growing, in, the, intervals, between, each, radiation, therapy, dose, as, one, example, of, the, localized, nature, of, breast, brachytherapy, the, savi, device, delivers, the, radiation, dose, through, multiple, catheters, each, of, which, can, be, individually, controlled, this, approach, decreases, the, exposure, of, healthy, tissue, and, resulting, side, effects, compared, both, to, external, beam, radiation, therapy, and, older, methods, of, breast, brachytherapy, radionuclide, therapy, also, known, as, systemic, radioisotope, therapy, radiopharmaceutical, therapy, or, molecular, radiotherapy, is, a, form, of, targeted, therapy, targeting, can, be, due, to, the, chemical, properties, of, the, isotope, such, as, radioiodine, which, is, specifically, absorbed, by, the, thyroid, gland, a, thousandfold, better, than, other, bodily, organs, targeting, can, also, be, achieved, by, attaching, the, radioisotope, to, another, molecule, or, antibody, to, guide, it, to, the, target, tissue, the, radioisotopes, are, delivered, through, infusion, into, the, bloodstream, or, ingestion, examples, are, the, infusion, of, metaiodobenzylguanidine, mibg, to, treat, neuroblastoma, of, oral, iodine, 131, to, treat, thyroid, cancer, or, thyrotoxicosis, and, of, hormone, bound, lutetium, 177, and, yttrium, 90, to, treat, neuroendocrine, tumors, peptide, receptor, radionuclide, therapy, another, example, is, the, injection, of, radioactive, yttrium, 90, or, holmium, 166, microspheres, into, the, hepatic, artery, to, radioembolize, liver, tumors, or, liver, metastases, these, microspheres, are, used, for, the, treatment, approach, known, as, selective, internal, radiation, therapy, the, microspheres, are, approximately, 30, m, in, diameter, about, one, third, of, a, human, hair, and, are, delivered, directly, into, the, artery, supplying, blood, to, the, tumors, these, treatments, begin, by, guiding, a, catheter, up, through, the, femoral, artery, in, the, leg, navigating, to, the, desired, target, site, and, administering, treatment, the, blood, feeding, the, tumor, will, carry, the, microspheres, directly, to, the, tumor, enabling, a, more, selective, approach, than, traditional, systemic, chemotherapy, there, are, currently, three, different, kinds, of, microspheres, sir, spheres, therasphere, and, quiremspheres, a, major, use, of, systemic, radioisotope, therapy, is, in, the, treatment, of, bone, metastasis, from, cancer, the, radioisotopes, travel, selectively, to, areas, of, damaged, bone, and, spare, normal, undamaged, bone, isotopes, commonly, used, in, the, treatment, of, bone, metastasis, are, radium, 223, strontium, 89, and, samarium, 153, sm, lexidronam, in, 2002, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, fda, approved, ibritumomab, tiuxetan, zevalin, which, is, an, anti, cd20, monoclonal, antibody, conjugated, to, yttrium, 90, in, 2003, the, fda, approved, the, tositumomab, iodine, 131, i, tositumomab, regimen, bexxar, which, is, a, combination, of, an, iodine, 131, labelled, and, an, unlabelled, anti, cd20, monoclonal, antibody, these, medications, were, the, first, agents, of, what, is, known, as, radioimmunotherapy, and, they, were, approved, for, the, treatment, of, refractory, non, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, intraoperative, radiation, therapy, iort, is, applying, therapeutic, levels, of, radiation, to, a, target, area, such, as, a, cancer, tumor, while, the, area, is, exposed, during, surgery, the, rationale, for, iort, is, to, deliver, a, high, dose, of, radiation, precisely, to, the, targeted, area, with, minimal, exposure, of, surrounding, tissues, which, are, displaced, or, shielded, during, the, iort, conventional, radiation, techniques, such, as, external, beam, radiotherapy, ebrt, following, surgical, removal, of, the, tumor, have, several, drawbacks, the, tumor, bed, where, the, highest, dose, should, be, applied, is, frequently, missed, due, to, the, complex, localization, of, the, wound, cavity, even, when, modern, radiotherapy, planning, is, used, additionally, the, usual, delay, between, the, surgical, removal, of, the, tumor, and, ebrt, may, allow, a, repopulation, of, the, tumor, cells, these, potentially, harmful, effects, can, be, avoided, by, delivering, the, radiation, more, precisely, to, the, targeted, tissues, leading, to, immediate, sterilization, of, residual, tumor, cells, another, aspect, is, that, wound, fluid, has, a, stimulating, effect, on, tumor, cells, iort, was, found, to, inhibit, the, stimulating, effects, of, wound, fluid, medicine, has, used, radiation, therapy, as, a, treatment, for, cancer, for, more, than, 100, years, with, its, earliest, roots, traced, from, the, discovery, of, x, rays, in, 1895, by, wilhelm, r, ntgen, emil, grubbe, of, chicago, was, possibly, the, first, american, physician, to, use, x, rays, to, treat, cancer, beginning, in, 1896, the, field, of, radiation, therapy, began, to, grow, in, the, early, 1900s, largely, due, to, the, groundbreaking, work, of, nobel, prize, winning, scientist, marie, curie, 1867, 1934, who, discovered, the, radioactive, elements, polonium, and, radium, in, 1898, this, began, a, new, era, in, medical, treatment, and, research, through, the, 1920s, the, hazards, of, radiation, exposure, were, not, understood, and, little, protection, was, used, radium, was, believed, to, have, wide, curative, powers, and, radiotherapy, was, applied, to, many, diseases, prior, to, world, war, 2, the, only, practical, sources, of, radiation, for, radiotherapy, were, radium, its, emanation, radon, gas, and, the, x, ray, tube, external, beam, radiotherapy, teletherapy, began, at, the, turn, of, the, century, with, relatively, low, voltage, 150, kv, x, ray, machines, it, was, found, that, while, superficial, tumors, could, be, treated, with, low, voltage, x, rays, more, penetrating, higher, energy, beams, were, required, to, reach, tumors, inside, the, body, requiring, higher, voltages, orthovoltage, x, rays, which, used, tube, voltages, of, 200, 500, kv, began, to, be, used, during, the, 1920s, to, reach, the, most, deeply, buried, tumors, without, exposing, intervening, skin, and, tissue, to, dangerous, radiation, doses, required, rays, with, energies, of, 1, mv, or, above, called, megavolt, radiation, producing, megavolt, x, rays, required, voltages, on, the, x, ray, tube, of, 3, to, 5, million, volts, which, required, huge, expensive, installations, megavoltage, x, ray, units, were, first, built, in, the, late, 1930s, but, because, of, cost, were, limited, to, a, few, institutions, one, of, the, first, installed, at, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, london, in, 1937, and, used, until, 1960, used, a, 30, foot, long, x, ray, tube, and, weighed, 10, tons, radium, produced, megavolt, gamma, rays, but, was, extremely, rare, and, expensive, due, to, its, low, occurrence, in, ores, in, 1937, the, entire, world, supply, of, radium, for, radiotherapy, was, 50, grams, valued, at, 800, 000, or, 50, million, in, 2005, dollars, the, invention, of, the, nuclear, reactor, in, the, manhattan, project, during, world, war, 2, made, possible, the, production, of, artificial, radioisotopes, for, radiotherapy, cobalt, therapy, teletherapy, machines, using, megavolt, gamma, rays, emitted, by, cobalt, 60, a, radioisotope, produced, by, irradiating, ordinary, cobalt, metal, in, a, reactor, revolutionized, the, field, between, the, 1950s, and, the, early, 1980s, cobalt, machines, were, relatively, cheap, robust, and, simple, to, use, although, due, to, its, 5, 27, year, half, life, the, cobalt, had, to, be, replaced, about, every, 5, years, medical, linear, particle, accelerators, developed, since, the, 1940s, began, replacing, x, ray, and, cobalt, units, in, the, 1980s, and, these, older, therapies, are, now, declining, the, first, medical, linear, accelerator, was, used, at, the, hammersmith, hospital, in, london, in, 1953, linear, accelerators, can, produce, higher, energies, have, more, collimated, beams, and, do, not, produce, radioactive, waste, with, its, attendant, disposal, problems, like, radioisotope, therapies, with, godfrey, hounsfield, s, invention, of, computed, tomography, ct, in, 1971, three, dimensional, planning, became, a, possibility, and, created, a, shift, from, 2, d, to, 3, d, radiation, delivery, ct, based, planning, allows, physicians, to, more, accurately, determine, the, dose, distribution, using, axial, tomographic, images, of, the, patient, s, anatomy, the, advent, of, new, imaging, technologies, including, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, in, the, 1970s, and, positron, emission, tomography, pet, in, the, 1980s, has, moved, radiation, therapy, from, 3, d, conformal, to, intensity, modulated, radiation, therapy, imrt, and, to, image, guided, radiation, therapy, tomotherapy, these, advances, allowed, radiation, oncologists, to, better, see, and, target, tumors, which, have, resulted, in, better, treatment, outcomes, more, organ, preservation, and, fewer, side, effects, while, access, to, radiotherapy, is, improving, globally, more, than, half, of, patients, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, still, do, not, have, available, access, to, the, therapy, as, of, 2017
