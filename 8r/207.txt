the, blood, sugar, level, blood, sugar, concentration, blood, glucose, level, or, glycemia, is, the, measure, of, glucose, concentrated, in, the, blood, the, body, tightly, regulates, blood, glucose, levels, as, a, part, of, metabolic, homeostasis, for, a, 70, kg, 154, lb, human, approximately, four, grams, of, dissolved, glucose, also, called, blood, glucose, is, maintained, in, the, blood, plasma, at, all, times, glucose, that, is, not, circulating, in, the, blood, is, stored, in, skeletal, muscle, and, liver, cells, in, the, form, of, glycogen, in, fasting, individuals, blood, glucose, is, maintained, at, a, constant, level, by, releasing, just, enough, glucose, from, these, glycogen, stores, in, the, liver, and, skeletal, muscle, in, order, to, maintain, homeostasis, glucose, can, be, transported, from, the, intestines, or, liver, to, other, tissues, in, the, body, via, the, bloodstream, cellular, glucose, uptake, is, primarily, regulated, by, insulin, a, hormone, produced, in, the, pancreas, once, inside, the, cell, the, glucose, can, now, act, as, an, energy, source, as, it, undergoes, the, process, of, glycolysis, in, humans, properly, maintained, glucose, levels, are, necessary, for, normal, function, in, a, number, of, tissues, including, the, human, brain, which, consumes, approximately, 60, of, blood, glucose, in, fasting, sedentary, individuals, a, persistent, elevation, in, blood, glucose, leads, to, glucose, toxicity, which, contributes, to, cell, dysfunction, and, the, pathology, grouped, together, as, complications, of, diabetes, glucose, levels, are, usually, lowest, in, the, morning, before, the, first, meal, of, the, day, and, rise, after, meals, for, an, hour, or, two, by, a, few, millimoles, per, litre, abnormal, persistently, high, glycemia, is, referred, to, as, hyperglycemia, low, levels, are, referred, to, as, hypoglycemia, diabetes, mellitus, is, characterized, by, persistent, hyperglycemia, from, a, variety, of, causes, and, it, is, the, most, prominent, disease, related, to, the, failure, of, blood, sugar, regulation, there, are, different, methods, of, testing, and, measuring, blood, sugar, levels, drinking, alcohol, causes, an, initial, surge, in, blood, sugar, and, later, tends, to, cause, levels, to, fall, also, certain, drugs, can, increase, or, decrease, glucose, levels, there, are, two, ways, of, measuring, blood, glucose, levels, in, the, united, kingdom, and, commonwealth, countries, australia, canada, india, etc, and, ex, ussr, countries, molar, concentration, measured, in, mmol, l, millimoles, per, litre, or, millimolar, abbreviated, mm, in, the, united, states, germany, japan, and, many, other, countries, mass, concentration, is, measured, in, mg, dl, milligrams, per, decilitre, since, the, molecular, mass, of, glucose, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, is, approximately, 180, g, mol, the, difference, between, the, two, units, is, a, factor, of, about, 18, so, 1, mmol, l, of, glucose, is, equivalent, to, 18, mg, dl, normal, blood, glucose, level, tested, while, fasting, for, non, diabetics, should, be, 3, 9, 5, 5, mmol, l, 70, 100, mg, dl, according, to, the, american, diabetes, association, the, fasting, blood, glucose, target, range, for, diabetics, should, be, 3, 9, 7, 2, mmol, l, 70, 130, mg, dl, and, less, than, 10, mmol, l, 180, mg, dl, two, hours, after, meals, as, measured, by, a, blood, glucose, monitor, normal, value, ranges, may, vary, slightly, between, laboratories, glucose, homeostasis, when, operating, normally, restores, the, blood, sugar, level, to, a, narrow, range, of, about, 4, 4, to, 6, 1, mmol, l, 79, to, 110, mg, dl, as, measured, by, a, fasting, blood, glucose, test, the, global, mean, fasting, plasma, blood, glucose, level, in, humans, is, about, 5, 5, mmol, l, 100, mg, dl, however, this, level, fluctuates, throughout, the, day, blood, sugar, levels, for, those, without, diabetes, and, who, are, not, fasting, should, be, below, 6, 9, mmol, l, 125, mg, dl, despite, widely, variable, intervals, between, meals, or, the, occasional, consumption, of, meals, with, a, substantial, carbohydrate, load, human, blood, glucose, levels, tend, to, remain, within, the, normal, range, however, shortly, after, eating, the, blood, glucose, level, may, rise, in, non, diabetics, temporarily, up, to, 7, 8, mmol, l, 140, mg, dl, or, slightly, more, the, actual, amount, of, glucose, in, the, blood, and, body, fluids, is, very, small, in, a, healthy, adult, male, of, 75, kg, 165, lb, with, a, blood, volume, of, 5, l, a, blood, glucose, level, of, 5, 5, mmol, l, 100, mg, dl, amounts, to, 5, g, equivalent, to, about, a, teaspoonful, of, sugar, part, of, the, reason, why, this, amount, is, so, small, is, that, to, maintain, an, influx, of, glucose, into, cells, enzymes, modify, glucose, by, adding, phosphate, or, other, groups, to, it, in, general, ranges, of, blood, sugar, in, common, domestic, ruminants, are, lower, than, in, many, monogastric, mammals, however, this, generalization, does, not, extend, to, wild, ruminants, or, camelids, for, serum, glucose, in, mg, dl, reference, ranges, of, 42, to, 75, for, cows, 44, to, 81, for, sheep, and, 48, to, 76, for, goats, but, 61, to, 124, for, cats, 62, to, 108, for, dogs, 62, to, 114, for, horses, 66, to, 116, for, pigs, 75, to, 155, for, rabbits, and, 90, to, 140, for, llamas, have, been, reported, a, 90, percent, reference, interval, for, serum, glucose, of, 26, to, 181, mg, dl, has, been, reported, for, captured, mountain, goats, oreamnos, americanus, where, no, effects, of, the, pursuit, and, capture, on, measured, levels, were, evident, for, beluga, whales, the, 25, 75, percent, range, for, serum, glucose, has, been, estimated, to, be, 94, to, 115, mg, dl, for, the, white, rhinoceros, one, study, has, indicated, that, the, 95, percent, range, is, 28, to, 140, mg, dl, for, harp, seals, a, serum, glucose, range, of, 4, 9, to, 12, 1, mmol, l, has, been, reported, for, hooded, seals, a, range, of, 7, 5, to, 15, 7, mmol, l, has, been, reported, the, body, s, homeostatic, mechanism, keeps, blood, glucose, levels, within, a, narrow, range, it, is, composed, of, several, interacting, systems, of, which, hormone, regulation, is, the, most, important, there, are, two, types, of, mutually, antagonistic, metabolic, hormones, affecting, blood, glucose, levels, these, hormones, are, secreted, from, pancreatic, islets, bundles, of, endocrine, tissues, of, which, there, are, four, types, alpha, a, cells, beta, b, cells, delta, d, cells, and, f, cells, glucagon, is, secreted, from, alpha, cells, while, insulin, is, secreted, by, beta, cells, together, they, regulate, the, blood, glucose, levels, through, negative, feedback, a, process, where, the, end, product, of, one, reaction, stimulates, the, beginning, of, another, reaction, in, blood, glucose, levels, insulin, lowers, the, concentration, of, glucose, in, the, blood, the, lower, blood, glucose, level, a, product, of, the, insulin, secretion, triggers, glucagon, to, be, secreted, and, repeats, the, cycle, in, order, for, blood, glucose, to, be, kept, stable, modifications, to, insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, and, cortisol, are, made, each, of, these, hormones, has, a, different, responsibility, to, keep, blood, glucose, regulated, when, blood, sugar, is, too, high, insulin, tells, muscles, to, take, up, excess, glucose, for, storage, in, the, form, of, glycogen, glucagon, responds, to, too, low, of, a, blood, glucose, level, it, informs, the, tissue, to, release, some, glucose, from, the, glycogen, stores, epinephrine, prepares, the, muscles, and, respiratory, system, for, activity, in, the, case, of, a, fight, or, flight, response, lastly, cortisol, supplies, the, body, with, fuel, in, times, of, heavy, stress, if, blood, sugar, levels, remain, too, high, the, body, suppresses, appetite, over, the, short, term, long, term, hyperglycemia, causes, many, health, problems, including, heart, disease, cancer, eye, kidney, and, nerve, damage, blood, sugar, levels, above, 16, 7, mmol, l, 300, mg, dl, can, cause, fatal, reactions, ketones, will, be, very, high, a, magnitude, higher, than, when, eating, a, very, low, carbohydrate, diet, initiating, ketoacidosis, the, ada, american, diabetes, association, recommends, seeing, a, doctor, if, blood, glucose, reaches, 13, 3, mmol, l, 240, mg, dl, and, it, is, recommended, to, seek, emergency, treatment, at, 15, mmol, l, 270, mg, dl, blood, glucose, if, ketones, are, present, the, most, common, cause, of, hyperglycemia, is, diabetes, when, diabetes, is, the, cause, physicians, typically, recommend, an, anti, diabetic, medication, as, treatment, from, the, perspective, of, the, majority, of, patients, treatment, with, an, old, well, understood, diabetes, drug, such, as, metformin, will, be, the, safest, most, effective, least, expensive, and, most, comfortable, route, to, managing, the, condition, treatment, will, vary, for, the, distinct, forms, of, diabetes, and, can, differ, from, person, to, person, based, on, how, they, are, reacting, to, treatment, diet, changes, and, exercise, implementation, may, also, be, part, of, a, treatment, plan, for, diabetes, some, medications, may, cause, a, rise, in, blood, sugars, of, diabetics, such, as, steroid, medications, including, cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, prednisone, and, dexamethasone, when, the, blood, sugar, level, is, below, 70, mg, dl, this, is, referred, to, as, having, low, blood, sugar, low, blood, sugar, is, very, frequent, among, type, 1, diabetics, there, are, several, causes, of, low, blood, sugar, including, taking, an, excessive, amount, of, insulin, not, consuming, enough, carbohydrates, drinking, alcohol, spending, time, at, a, high, elevation, puberty, and, menstruation, if, blood, sugar, levels, drop, too, low, a, potentially, fatal, condition, called, hypoglycemia, develops, symptoms, may, include, lethargy, impaired, mental, functioning, irritability, shaking, twitching, weakness, in, arm, and, leg, muscles, pale, complexion, sweating, loss, of, consciousness, mechanisms, that, restore, satisfactory, blood, glucose, levels, after, extreme, hypoglycemia, below, 2, 2, mmol, l, or, 40, mg, dl, must, be, quick, and, effective, to, prevent, extremely, serious, consequences, of, insufficient, glucose, confusion, or, unsteadiness, and, in, the, extreme, below, 0, 8, mmol, l, or, 15, mg, dl, loss, of, consciousness, and, seizures, without, discounting, the, potentially, quite, serious, conditions, and, risks, due, to, or, oftentimes, accompanying, hyperglycemia, especially, in, the, long, term, diabetes, or, pre, diabetes, obesity, or, overweight, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, etc, it, is, still, generally, more, dangerous, to, have, too, little, glucose, especially, if, levels, are, very, low, in, the, blood, than, too, much, at, least, temporarily, because, glucose, is, so, important, for, metabolism, and, nutrition, and, the, proper, functioning, of, the, body, s, organs, this, is, especially, the, case, for, those, organs, that, are, metabolically, active, or, that, require, a, constant, regulated, supply, of, blood, sugar, the, liver, and, brain, are, examples, symptomatic, hypoglycemia, is, most, likely, associated, with, diabetes, and, liver, disease, especially, overnight, or, postprandial, without, treatment, or, with, wrong, treatment, possibly, in, combination, with, carbohydrate, malabsorption, physical, over, exertion, or, drugs, many, other, less, likely, illnesses, like, cancer, could, also, be, a, reason, starvation, possibly, due, to, eating, disorders, like, anorexia, will, also, eventually, lead, to, hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic, episodes, can, vary, greatly, between, persons, and, from, time, to, time, both, in, severity, and, swiftness, of, onset, for, severe, cases, prompt, medical, assistance, is, essential, as, damage, to, brain, and, other, tissues, and, even, death, will, result, from, sufficiently, low, blood, glucose, levels, in, the, past, to, measure, blood, glucose, it, was, necessary, to, take, a, blood, sample, as, explained, below, but, since, 2015, it, has, also, been, possible, to, use, a, continuous, glucose, monitor, which, involves, an, electrode, placed, under, the, skin, both, methods, as, of, 2023, cost, hundreds, of, dollars, or, euros, per, year, for, supplies, needed, glucose, testing, in, a, fasting, individual, shows, comparable, levels, of, glucose, in, arterial, venous, and, capillary, blood, but, following, meals, capillary, and, arterial, blood, glucose, levels, can, be, significantly, higher, than, venous, levels, although, these, differences, vary, widely, one, study, found, that, following, the, consumption, of, 50, grams, of, glucose, the, mean, capillary, blood, glucose, concentration, is, higher, than, the, mean, venous, blood, glucose, concentration, by, 35, glucose, is, measured, in, whole, blood, plasma, or, serum, historically, blood, glucose, values, were, given, in, terms, of, whole, blood, but, most, laboratories, now, measure, and, report, plasma, or, serum, glucose, levels, because, red, blood, cells, erythrocytes, have, a, higher, concentration, of, protein, e, g, hemoglobin, than, serum, serum, has, a, higher, water, content, and, consequently, more, dissolved, glucose, than, does, whole, blood, to, convert, from, whole, blood, glucose, multiplication, by, 1, 14, has, been, shown, to, generally, give, the, serum, plasma, level, to, prevent, contamination, of, the, sample, with, intravenous, fluids, particular, care, should, be, given, to, drawing, blood, samples, from, the, arm, opposite, the, one, in, which, an, intravenous, line, is, inserted, alternatively, blood, can, be, drawn, from, the, same, arm, with, an, iv, line, after, the, iv, has, been, turned, off, for, at, least, 5, minutes, and, the, arm, has, been, elevated, to, drain, infused, fluids, away, from, the, vein, inattention, can, lead, to, large, errors, since, as, little, as, 10, contamination, with, a, 5, glucose, solution, d5w, will, elevate, glucose, in, a, sample, by, 500, mg, dl, or, more, the, actual, concentration, of, glucose, in, blood, is, very, low, even, in, the, hyperglycemic, two, major, methods, have, been, used, to, measure, glucose, the, first, still, in, use, in, some, places, is, a, chemical, method, exploiting, the, nonspecific, reducing, property, of, glucose, in, a, reaction, with, an, indicator, substance, that, changes, color, when, reduced, since, other, blood, compounds, also, have, reducing, properties, e, g, urea, which, can, be, abnormally, high, in, uremic, patients, this, technique, can, produce, erroneous, readings, in, some, situations, 5, 15, mg, dl, has, been, reported, the, more, recent, technique, using, enzymes, specific, to, glucose, is, less, susceptible, to, this, kind, of, error, the, two, most, common, employed, enzymes, are, glucose, oxidase, and, hexokinase, average, blood, glucose, concentrations, can, also, be, measured, this, method, measures, the, level, of, glycated, hemoglobin, which, is, representative, of, the, average, blood, glucose, levels, over, the, last, approximately, 120, days, in, either, case, the, chemical, system, is, commonly, contained, on, a, test, strip, which, is, inserted, into, a, meter, and, then, has, a, blood, sample, applied, test, strip, shapes, and, their, exact, chemical, composition, vary, between, meter, systems, and, cannot, be, interchanged, formerly, some, test, strips, were, read, after, timing, and, wiping, away, the, blood, sample, by, visual, comparison, against, a, color, chart, printed, on, the, vial, label, strips, of, this, type, are, still, used, for, urine, glucose, readings, but, for, blood, glucose, levels, they, are, obsolete, their, error, rates, were, in, any, case, much, higher, errors, when, using, test, strips, were, often, caused, by, the, age, of, the, strip, or, exposure, to, high, temperatures, or, humidity, more, precise, blood, glucose, measurements, are, performed, in, a, medical, laboratory, using, hexokinase, glucose, oxidase, or, glucose, dehydrogenase, enzymes, urine, glucose, readings, however, taken, are, much, less, useful, in, properly, functioning, kidneys, glucose, does, not, appear, in, urine, until, the, renal, threshold, for, glucose, has, been, exceeded, this, is, substantially, above, any, normal, glucose, level, and, is, evidence, of, an, existing, severe, hyperglycemic, condition, however, as, urine, is, stored, in, the, bladder, any, glucose, in, it, might, have, been, produced, at, any, time, since, the, last, time, the, bladder, was, emptied, since, metabolic, conditions, change, rapidly, as, a, result, of, any, of, several, factors, this, is, delayed, news, and, gives, no, warning, of, a, developing, condition, blood, glucose, monitoring, is, far, preferable, both, clinically, and, for, home, monitoring, by, patients, healthy, urine, glucose, levels, were, first, standardized, and, published, in, 1965, by, hans, renschler, a, noninvasive, method, of, sampling, to, monitor, glucose, levels, has, emerged, using, an, exhaled, breath, condensate, however, this, method, does, need, highly, sensitive, glucose, biosensors, g, l, u, c, o, s, e, a, t, p, p, h, o, s, p, h, o, r, y, l, a, t, i, o, n, h, e, x, o, k, i, n, a, s, e, m, g, 2, g, 6po, 4, a, d, p, g, 6po, 4, n, a, d, p, o,

measured, after, a, fast, of, 8, hours, is, the, most, commonly, used, indication, of, overall, glucose, homeostasis, largely, because, disturbing, events, such, as, food, intake, are, avoided, conditions, affecting, glucose, levels, are, shown, in, the, table, below, abnormalities, in, these, test, results, are, due, to, problems, in, the, multiple, control, mechanism, of, glucose, regulation, the, metabolic, response, to, a, carbohydrate, challenge, is, conveniently, assessed, by, a, postprandial, glucose, level, drawn, 2, hours, after, a, meal, or, a, glucose, load, in, addition, the, glucose, tolerance, test, consisting, of, several, timed, measurements, after, a, standardized, amount, of, oral, glucose, intake, is, used, to, aid, in, the, diagnosis, of, diabetes, error, rates, for, blood, glucose, measurements, systems, vary, depending, on, laboratories, and, on, the, methods, used, colorimetry, techniques, can, be, biased, by, color, changes, in, test, strips, from, airborne, or, finger, borne, contamination, perhaps, or, interference, e, g, tinting, contaminants, with, light, source, or, the, light, sensor, electrical, techniques, are, less, susceptible, to, these, errors, though, not, to, others, in, home, use, the, most, important, issue, is, not, accuracy, but, trend, thus, if, a, meter, test, strip, system, is, consistently, wrong, by, 10, there, will, be, little, consequence, as, long, as, changes, e, g, due, to, exercise, or, medication, adjustments, are, properly, tracked, in, the, us, home, use, blood, test, meters, must, be, approved, by, the, federal, food, and, drug, administration, before, they, can, be, sold, finally, there, are, several, influences, on, blood, glucose, level, aside, from, food, intake, infection, for, instance, tends, to, change, blood, glucose, levels, as, does, stress, either, physical, or, psychological, exercise, especially, if, prolonged, or, long, after, the, most, recent, meal, will, have, an, effect, as, well, in, the, typical, person, maintenance, of, blood, glucose, at, near, constant, levels, will, nevertheless, be, quite, effective
