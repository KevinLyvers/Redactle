nervous, tissue, also, called, neural, tissue, is, the, main, tissue, component, of, the, nervous, system, the, nervous, system, regulates, and, controls, body, functions, and, activity, it, consists, of, two, parts, the, central, nervous, system, cns, comprising, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, and, the, peripheral, nervous, system, pns, comprising, the, branching, peripheral, nerves, it, is, composed, of, neurons, also, known, as, nerve, cells, which, receive, and, transmit, impulses, and, neuroglia, also, known, as, glial, cells, or, glia, which, assist, the, propagation, of, the, nerve, impulse, as, well, as, provide, nutrients, to, the, neurons, nervous, tissue, is, made, up, of, different, types, of, neurons, all, of, which, have, an, axon, an, axon, is, the, long, stem, like, part, of, the, cell, that, sends, action, potentials, to, the, next, cell, bundles, of, axons, make, up, the, nerves, in, the, pns, and, tracts, in, the, cns, functions, of, the, nervous, system, are, sensory, input, integration, control, of, muscles, and, glands, homeostasis, and, mental, activity, nervous, tissue, is, composed, of, neurons, also, called, nerve, cells, and, neuroglial, cells, four, types, of, neuroglia, found, in, the, cns, are, astrocytes, microglial, cells, ependymal, cells, and, oligodendrocytes, two, types, of, neuroglia, found, in, the, pns, are, satellite, glial, cells, and, schwann, cells, in, the, central, nervous, system, cns, the, tissue, types, found, are, grey, matter, and, white, matter, the, tissue, is, categorized, by, its, neuronal, and, neuroglial, components, neurons, are, cells, with, specialized, features, that, allow, them, to, receive, and, facilitate, nerve, impulses, or, action, potentials, across, their, membrane, to, the, next, neuron, they, possess, a, large, cell, body, soma, with, cell, projections, called, dendrites, and, an, axon, dendrites, are, thin, branching, projections, that, receive, electrochemical, signaling, neurotransmitters, to, create, a, change, in, voltage, in, the, cell, axons, are, long, projections, that, carry, the, action, potential, away, from, the, cell, body, toward, the, next, neuron, the, bulb, like, end, of, the, axon, called, the, axon, terminal, is, separated, from, the, dendrite, of, the, following, neuron, by, a, small, gap, called, a, synaptic, cleft, when, the, action, potential, travels, to, the, axon, terminal, neurotransmitters, are, released, across, the, synapse, and, bind, to, the, post, synaptic, receptors, continuing, the, nerve, impulse, neurons, are, classified, both, functionally, and, structurally, functional, classification, structural, classification, neuroglia, encompasses, the, non, neural, cells, in, nervous, tissue, that, provide, various, crucial, supportive, functions, for, neurons, they, are, smaller, than, neurons, and, vary, in, structure, according, to, their, function, neuroglial, cells, are, classified, as, follows, in, the, central, nervous, system, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, the, three, layers, of, connective, tissue, surrounding, each, nerve, are, the, function, of, nervous, tissue, is, to, form, the, communication, network, of, the, nervous, system, by, conducting, electric, signals, across, tissue, in, the, cns, grey, matter, which, contains, the, synapses, is, important, for, information, processing, white, matter, containing, myelinated, axons, connects, and, facilitates, nerve, impulse, between, grey, matter, areas, in, the, cns, in, the, pns, the, ganglion, tissue, containing, the, cell, bodies, and, dendrites, contain, relay, points, for, nerve, tissue, impulses, the, nerve, tissue, containing, myelinated, axons, bundles, carry, action, potential, nerve, impulses, neoplasms, tumours, in, nervous, tissue, include
