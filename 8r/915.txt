see, text, cupressus, is, one, of, several, genera, of, evergreen, conifers, within, the, family, cupressaceae, that, have, the, common, name, cypress, for, the, others, see, cypress, it, is, considered, a, polyphyletic, group, based, on, genetic, and, morphological, analysis, the, genus, cupressus, is, found, in, the, subfamily, cupressoideae, the, common, name, cypress, comes, via, the, old, french, cipres, from, the, latin, cyparissus, which, is, the, latinisation, of, the, greek, kyp, rissos, cypress, are, evergreen, trees, or, large, shrubs, growing, to, 5, 40, m, 16, 131, ft, tall, the, leaves, are, scale, like, 2, 6, mm, long, arranged, in, opposite, decussate, pairs, and, persist, for, three, to, five, years, on, young, plants, up, to, two, years, old, the, leaves, are, needle, like, and, 5, 15, mm, long, the, cones, are, 8, 40, mm, long, globose, or, ovoid, with, 4, to, 14, scales, arranged, in, opposite, decussate, pairs, they, are, mature, in, 18, 24, months, from, pollination, the, seeds, are, small, 4, 7, mm, long, with, two, narrow, wings, one, along, each, side, of, the, seed, many, of, the, species, are, adapted, to, forest, fires, holding, their, seeds, for, many, years, in, closed, cones, until, the, parent, trees, are, killed, by, a, fire, the, seeds, are, then, released, to, colonise, the, bare, burnt, ground, in, other, species, the, cones, open, at, maturity, to, release, the, seeds, as, currently, treated, these, cypresses, are, native, to, scattered, localities, in, mainly, warm, temperate, regions, in, the, northern, hemisphere, including, northwest, africa, the, middle, east, the, himalayas, southern, china, and, northern, vietnam, as, with, other, conifers, extensive, cultivation, has, led, to, a, wide, variety, of, forms, sizes, and, colours, that, are, grown, in, parks, and, gardens, throughout, the, world, many, species, of, cypress, are, grown, as, decorative, trees, in, parks, and, in, asia, around, temples, in, some, areas, the, native, distribution, is, hard, to, discern, due, to, extensive, cultivation, a, few, species, are, grown, for, their, timber, which, can, be, very, durable, the, fast, growing, hybrid, leyland, cypress, cupressus, leylandii, much, used, in, gardens, draws, one, of, its, parents, from, this, genus, cupressus, macrocarpa, monterey, cypress, the, other, parent, callitropsis, nootkatensis, nootka, cypress, is, also, sometimes, classified, in, this, genus, or, else, in, the, separate, genus, xanthocyparis, but, in, the, past, more, usually, in, chamaecyparis, it, was, believed, in, the, hellenic, culture, that, the, cypress, tree, was, sacred, to, the, gods, and, it, is, now, used, as, an, emblem, of, grief, the, name, of, the, genus, comes, from, cyparissos, a, young, man, loved, by, apollo, very, attached, to, a, deer, which, he, ended, up, killing, by, mistake, during, a, hunting, trip, to, ease, the, pain, apollo, transformed, the, boy, into, a, plant, the, association, with, mourning, continued, in, roman, times, up, to, the, present, day, also, for, a, practical, reason, the, roots, of, the, cypress, are, straight, into, the, ground, and, expand, slightly, laterally, not, damaging, the, burials, there, has, long, been, significant, uncertainty, about, the, new, world, members, of, cupressus, with, several, studies, recovering, them, as, forming, a, distinct, clade, from, the, old, world, members, a, 2021, molecular, study, found, cupressus, to, be, the, sister, genus, to, juniperus, whereas, the, western, members, classified, in, callitropsis, and, hesperocyparis, were, found, to, be, sister, to, xanthocyparis, juniperus, c, pendula, thunberg, c, tonkinensis, silba, c, sempervirens, von, linn, c,

the, number, of, species, recognised, within, this, genus, varies, sharply, from, 16, to, 25, or, more, according, to, the, authority, followed, because, most, populations, are, small, and, isolated, and, whether, they, should, be, accorded, specific, subspecific, or, varietal, rank, is, difficult, to, ascertain, current, tendencies, are, to, reduce, the, number, of, recognised, species, when, a,

previously, thought, being, more, closely, related, to, xanthocyparis, than, to, the, rest, of, cupressus, these, species, have, recently, been, transferred, to, hesperocyparis, and, callitropsis, new, world, species, are, found, in, marginal, habitats, with, xeric, soils, and, therefore, exhibit, a, fragmented, allopatric, pattern, of, distribution, this, type, of, distribution, results, in, disproportionate, local, abundance, with, most, species, restricted, to, small, neighboring, populations, all, plants, in, the, genus, cupressus, including, new, world, cupressus, now, callitropsis,
