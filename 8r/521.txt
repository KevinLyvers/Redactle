echeneididae, the, remora, r, m, r, sometimes, called, suckerfish, or, sharksucker, is, any, of, a, family, echeneidae, of, ray, finned, fish, in, the, order, carangiformes, depending, on, species, they, grow, to, 30, 110, cm, 12, 43, in, long, their, distinctive, first, dorsal, fins, take, the, form, of, a, modified, oval, sucker, like, organ, with, slat, like, structures, that, open, and, close, to, create, suction, and, take, a, firm, hold, against, the, skin, of, larger, marine, animals, the, disk, is, made, up, of, stout, flexible, membranes, that, can, be, raised, and, lowered, to, generate, suction, by, sliding, backward, the, remora, can, increase, the, suction, or, it, can, release, itself, by, swimming, forward, remoras, sometimes, attach, to, small, boats, and, have, been, observed, attaching, to, divers, as, well, they, swim, well, on, their, own, with, a, sinuous, or, curved, motion, remora, front, dorsal, fins, have, evolved, to, enable, them, to, adhere, by, suction, to, smooth, surfaces, and, they, spend, most, of, their, lives, clinging, to, a, host, animal, such, as, a, whale, turtle, shark, or, ray, it, is, probably, a, mutualistic, arrangement, as, the, remora, can, move, around, on, the, host, removing, ectoparasites, and, loose, flakes, of, skin, while, benefiting, from, the, protection, provided, by, the, host, and, the, constant, flow, of, water, across, its, gills, although, it, was, initially, believed, that, remoras, fed, off, particulate, matter, from, the, host, s, meals, this, has, been, shown, to, be, false, in, reality, their, diets, are, composed, primarily, of, host, feces, remoras, are, tropical, open, ocean, dwellers, but, are, occasionally, found, in, temperate, or, coastal, waters, if, they, have, attached, to, large, fish, that, have, wandered, into, these, areas, in, the, mid, atlantic, ocean, spawning, usually, takes, place, in, june, and, july, in, the, mediterranean, sea, it, occurs, in, august, and, september, the, sucking, disc, begins, to, show, when, the, young, fish, are, about, 1, cm, 0, 4, in, long, when, the, remora, reaches, about, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, the, disc, is, fully, formed, and, the, remora, can, then, attach, to, other, animals, the, remora, s, lower, jaw, projects, beyond, the, upper, and, the, animal, lacks, a, swim, bladder, some, remoras, associate, with, specific, host, species, they, are, commonly, found, attached, to, sharks, manta, rays, whales, turtles, and, dugongs, hence, the, common, names, sharksucker, and, whalesucker, smaller, remoras, also, fasten, onto, fish, such, as, tuna, and, swordfish, and, some, of, the, smallest, remoras, travel, in, the, mouths, or, gills, of, large, manta, rays, ocean, sunfish, swordfish, and, sailfish, the, relationship, between, a, remora, and, its, host, is, most, often, taken, to, be, one, of, commensalism, specifically, phoresy, while, some, of, the, relationships, are, mutualistic, it, is, believed, that, dolphins, with, remoras, attached, do, not, benefit, from, the, relationship, the, attachment, of, the, remora, adds, resistance, to, the, dolphin, making, the, energy, needed, for, swimming, greater, the, remora, is, also, thought, to, irritate, the, skin, of, the, dolphin, research, into, the, physiology, of, the, remora, has, been, of, significant, benefit, to, the, understanding, of, ventilation, costs, in, fish, remoras, like, many, other, fishes, have, two, different, modes, of, ventilation, ram, ventilation, is, the, process, in, which, at, higher, speeds, the, remora, uses, the, force, of, the, water, moving, past, it, to, create, movement, of, fluid, in, the, gills, at, lower, speeds, the, remora, will, use, a, form, of, active, ventilation, in, which, the, fish, actively, moves, fluid, through, its, gills, in, order, to, use, active, ventilation, a, fish, must, actively, use, energy, to, move, the, fluid, however, determining, this, energy, cost, is, normally, complicated, due, to, the, fish, s, movement, when, using, either, method, as, a, result, the, remora, has, proved, invaluable, in, finding, this, cost, difference, since, they, will, stick, to, a, shark, or, tube, and, hence, remain, stationary, despite, the, movement, or, lack, thereof, of, water, experimental, data, from, studies, on, remora, found, that, the, associated, cost, for, active, ventilation, created, a, 3, 7, 5, 1, increased, energy, consumption, in, order, to, maintain, the, same, quantity, of, fluid, flow, the, fish, obtained, by, using, ram, ventilation, other, research, into, the, remora, s, physiology, came, about, as, a, result, of, studies, across, multiple, taxa, or, using, the, remora, as, an, out, group, for, certain, evolutionary, studies, concerning, the, latter, case, remoras, were, used, as, an, outgroup, when, investigating, tetrodotoxin, resistance, in, remoras, pufferfish, and, related, species, finding, remoras, specifically, echeneis, naucrates, had, a, resistance, of, 6, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, m, some, cultures, use, remoras, to, catch, turtles, a, cord, or, rope, is, fastened, to, the, remora, s, tail, and, when, a, turtle, is, sighted, the, fish, is, released, from, the, boat, it, usually, heads, directly, for, the, turtle, and, fastens, itself, to, the, turtle, s, shell, and, then, both, remora, and, turtle, are, hauled, in, smaller, turtles, can, be, pulled, completely, into, the, boat, by, this, method, while, larger, ones, are, hauled, within, harpooning, range, this, practice, has, been, reported, throughout, the, indian, ocean, especially, from, eastern, africa, near, zanzibar, and, mozambique, and, from, northern, australia, near, cape, york, and, torres, strait, similar, reports, come, from, japan, and, from, the, americas, some, of, the, first, records, of, the, fishing, fish, in, the, western, literature, come, from, the, accounts, of, the, second, voyage, of, christopher, columbus, however, leo, wiener, considers, the, columbus, accounts, to, be, apocryphal, what, was, taken, for, accounts, of, the, americas, may, have, been, in, fact, notes, columbus, derived, from, accounts, of, the, east, indies, his, desired, destination, in, ancient, times, the, remora, was, believed, to, stop, a, ship, from, sailing, in, latin, remora, means, delay, while, the, genus, name, echeneis, comes, from, greek, echein, to, hold, and, naus, a, ship, in, a, notable, account, by, pliny, the, elder, the, remora, is, blamed, for, the, defeat, of, mark, antony, at, the, battle, of, actium, and, indirectly, for, the, death, of, caligula, a, modern, version, of, the, story, is, given, by, jorge, luis, borges, in, book, of, imaginary, beings, 1957
