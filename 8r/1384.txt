respiratory, failure, results, from, inadequate, gas, exchange, by, the, respiratory, system, meaning, that, the, arterial, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, or, both, cannot, be, kept, at, normal, levels, a, drop, in, the, oxygen, carried, in, the, blood, is, known, as, hypoxemia, a, rise, in, arterial, carbon, dioxide, levels, is, called, hypercapnia, respiratory, failure, is, classified, as, either, type, 1, or, type, 2, based, on, whether, there, is, a, high, carbon, dioxide, level, and, can, be, acute, or, chronic, in, clinical, trials, the, definition, of, respiratory, failure, usually, includes, increased, respiratory, rate, abnormal, blood, gases, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or, both, and, evidence, of, increased, work, of, breathing, respiratory, failure, causes, an, altered, state, of, consciousness, due, to, ischemia, in, the, brain, the, typical, partial, pressure, reference, values, are, oxygen, pa, o, 2, more, than, 80, mmhg, 11, kpa, and, carbon, dioxide, pa, co, 2, less, than, 45, mmhg, 6, 0, kpa, a, variety, of, conditions, that, can, potentially, result, in, respiratory, failure, the, etiologies, of, each, type, of, respiratory, failure, see, below, may, differ, as, well, different, types, of, conditions, may, cause, respiratory, failure, respiratory, failure, is, generally, organized, into, 4, types, below, is, a, diagram, that, provides, a, general, overview, of, the, 4, types, of, respiratory, failure, their, distinguishing, characteristics, and, major, causes, of, each, type, 1, respiratory, failure, is, characterized, by, a, low, level, of, oxygen, in, the, blood, hypoxemia, pao2, 60, mmhg, with, a, normal, normocapnia, or, low, hypocapnia, level, of, carbon, dioxide, paco2, in, the, blood, the, fundamental, defect, in, type, 1, respiratory, failure, is, a, failure, of, oxygenation, characterized, by, type, i, respiratory, failure, is, caused, by, conditions, that, affect, oxygenation, and, therefore, lead, to, lower, than, normal, oxygen, in, the, blood, these, include, hypoxemia, pao, 2, 8kpa, or, normal, with, hypercapnia, paco, 2, 6, 0kpa, the, basic, defect, in, type, 2, respiratory, failure, is, characterized, by, type, 2, respiratory, failure, is, caused, by, inadequate, alveolar, ventilation, both, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, are, affected, defined, as, the, buildup, of, carbon, dioxide, levels, p, a, co, 2, that, has, been, generated, by, the, body, but, cannot, be, eliminated, the, underlying, causes, include, type, 3, respiratory, failure, is, a, type, of, type, 1, respiratory, failure, with, decreased, pao2, hypoxemia, and, either, normal, or, decreased, paco2, however, because, of, its, prevalence, it, has, been, given, its, own, category, type, 3, respiratory, failure, is, often, referred, to, as, peri, operative, respiratory, failure, because, it, is, distinguished, by, being, a, type, 1, respiratory, failure, that, is, specifically, associated, with, an, operation, procedure, or, surgery, the, pathophysiology, of, type, 3, respiratory, failure, often, includes, lung, atelectasis, which, is, a, term, used, to, describe, a, collapsing, of, the, functional, units, of, the, lung, that, allow, for, gas, exchange, because, atelectasis, occurs, so, commonly, in, the, perioperative, period, this, form, is, also, called, perioperative, respiratory, failure, after, general, anesthesia, decreases, in, functional, residual, capacity, leads, to, collapse, of, dependent, lung, units, type, 4, respiratory, failure, occurs, when, metabolic, oxygen, demands, exceed, what, the, cardiopulmonary, system, can, provide, it, often, results, from, hypoperfusion, of, respiratory, muscles, as, in, patients, in, shock, such, as, cardiogenic, shock, or, hypovolemic, shock, patients, in, shock, often, experience, respiratory, distress, due, to, pulmonary, edema, e, g, in, cardiogenic, shock, lactic, acidosis, and, anemia, can, also, result, in, type, 4, respiratory, failure, however, type, 1, and, 2, are, the, most, widely, accepted, physical, exam, findings, often, found, in, patients, with, respiratory, failure, include, findings, indicative, of, impaired, oxygenation, low, blood, oxygen, level, these, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, following, people, with, respiratory, failure, often, exhibit, other, signs, or, symptoms, that, are, associated, with, the, underlying, cause, of, their, respiratory, failure, for, instance, if, respiratory, failure, is, caused, by, cardiogenic, shock, decreased, perfusion, due, to, heart, dysfunction, symptoms, of, heart, dysfunction, e, g, pitting, edema, are, also, expected, arterial, blood, gas, abg, assessment, is, considered, the, gold, standard, diagnostic, test, for, establishing, a, diagnosis, of, respiratory, failure, this, is, because, abg, can, be, used, to, measure, blood, oxygen, levels, pao2, and, respiratory, failure, all, types, is, characterized, by, a, low, blood, oxygen, level, alternative, or, supporting, diagnostic, methods, include, the, following, imaging, eg, ultrasonography, radiography, may, be, used, to, assist, in, the, diagnostic, workup, for, example, it, may, be, utilized, to, determine, the, etiology, of, a, person, s, respiratory, failure, treatment, of, the, underlying, cause, is, required, if, possible, the, treatment, of, acute, respiratory, failure, may, involve, medication, such, as, bronchodilators, for, airways, disease, antibiotics, for, infections, glucocorticoids, for, numerous, causes, diuretics, for, pulmonary, oedema, amongst, others, respiratory, failure, resulting, from, an, overdose, of, opioids, may, be, treated, with, the, antidote, naloxone, in, contrast, most, benzodiazepine, overdose, does, not, benefit, from, its, antidote, flumazenil, respiratory, therapy, respiratory, physiotherapy, may, be, beneficial, in, some, cases, of, respiratory, failure, type, 1, respiratory, failure, may, require, oxygen, therapy, to, achieve, adequate, oxygen, saturation, lack, of, oxygen, response, may, indicate, other, modalities, such, as, heated, humidified, high, flow, therapy, continuous, positive, airway, pressure, or, if, severe, endotracheal, intubation, and, mechanical, ventilation, type, 2, respiratory, failure, often, requires, non, invasive, ventilation, niv, unless, medical, therapy, can, improve, the, situation, mechanical, ventilation, is, sometimes, indicated, immediately, or, otherwise, if, niv, fails, respiratory, stimulants, such, as, doxapram, are, now, rarely, used, there, is, tentative, evidence, that, in, those, with, respiratory, failure, identified, before, arrival, in, hospital, continuous, positive, airway, pressure, can, be, helpful, when, started, before, conveying, to, hospital, prognosis, is, highly, variable, and, dependent, on, etiology, and, availability, of, appropriate, treatment, and, management, one, of, three, hospitalized, cases, of, acute, respiratory, failure, is, fatal
