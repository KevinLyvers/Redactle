the, papaya, p, p, a, us, p, p, j, papaw, p, p, or, pawpaw, p, p, is, the, plant, species, carica, papaya, one, of, the, 21, accepted, species, in, the, genus, carica, of, the, family, caricaceae, and, also, the, name, of, its, fruit, it, was, first, domesticated, in, mesoamerica, within, modern, day, southern, mexico, and, central, america, it, is, grown, in, several, countries, in, regions, with, a, tropical, climate, in, 2022, india, produced, 38, of, the, world, s, supply, of, papayas, the, word, papaya, derives, from, arawak, via, spanish, and, is, also, the, name, for, the, plant, the, name, papaw, or, pawpaw, is, used, alternatively, for, the, fruit, only, in, some, regions, the, papaya, is, a, small, sparsely, branched, tree, usually, with, a, single, stem, growing, from, 5, to, 10, m, 16, to, 33, ft, tall, with, spirally, arranged, leaves, confined, to, the, top, of, the, trunk, the, lower, trunk, is, conspicuously, scarred, where, leaves, and, fruit, were, borne, the, leaves, are, large, 50, 70, cm, 20, 28, in, in, diameter, deeply, palmately, lobed, with, seven, lobes, all, plant, parts, contain, latex, in, articulated, laticifers, papayas, are, dioecious, the, flowers, are, five, parted, and, highly, dimorphic, the, male, flowers, have, the, stamens, fused, to, the, petals, there, are, two, different, types, of, papaya, flowers, the, female, flowers, have, a, superior, ovary, and, five, contorted, petals, loosely, connected, at, the, base, 235, male, and, female, flowers, are, borne, in, the, leaf, axils, the, male, flowers, are, in, multiflowered, dichasia, and, the, female, ones, are, in, few, flowered, dichasia, the, pollen, grains, are, elongated, and, approximately, 35, microns, in, length, the, flowers, are, sweet, scented, open, at, night, and, are, wind, or, insect, pollinated, the, fruit, is, a, large, berry, about, 15, 45, cm, 6, 17, 3, 4, in, long, and, 10, 30, cm, 4, 11, 3, 4, in, in, diameter, 88, it, is, ripe, when, it, feels, soft, as, soft, as, a, ripe, avocado, or, softer, its, skin, has, attained, an, amber, to, orange, hue, and, along, the, walls, of, the, large, central, cavity, are, attached, numerous, black, seeds, papaya, skin, pulp, and, seeds, contain, a, variety, of, phytochemicals, including, carotenoids, and, polyphenols, as, well, as, benzyl, isothiocyanates, and, benzyl, glucosinates, with, skin, and, pulp, levels, that, increase, during, ripening, the, carotenoids, lutein, and, beta, carotene, are, prominent, in, the, yellow, skin, while, lycopene, is, dominant, in, the, red, flesh, table, papaya, seeds, also, contain, the, cyanogenic, substance, prunasin, the, green, fruit, contains, papain, a, cysteine, protease, enzyme, used, to, tenderize, meat, see, below, native, to, tropical, america, papaya, originates, from, southern, mexico, and, central, america, papaya, is, also, considered, native, to, southern, florida, introduced, by, predecessors, of, the, calusa, no, later, than, ad, 300, spaniards, introduced, papaya, to, the, old, world, in, the, 16th, century, papaya, cultivation, is, now, nearly, pantropical, spanning, hawaii, central, africa, india, and, australia, wild, populations, of, papaya, are, generally, confined, to, naturally, disturbed, tropical, forests, papaya, is, found, in, abundance, on, everglades, hammocks, following, major, hurricanes, but, is, otherwise, infrequent, in, the, rain, forests, of, southern, mexico, papaya, thrives, and, reproduces, quickly, in, canopy, gaps, while, dying, off, in, the, mature, closed, canopy, forests, papaya, ringspot, virus, is, a, well, known, virus, within, plants, in, florida, the, first, signs, of, the, virus, are, yellowing, and, vein, clearing, of, younger, leaves, and, mottling, yellow, leaves, infected, leaves, may, obtain, blisters, roughen, or, narrow, with, blades, sticking, upwards, from, the, middle, of, the, leaves, the, petioles, and, stems, may, develop, dark, green, greasy, streaks, and, in, time, become, shorter, the, ringspots, are, circular, c, shaped, markings, that, are, a, darker, green, than, the, fruit, in, the, later, stages, of, the, virus, the, markings, may, become, gray, and, crusty, viral, infections, impact, growth, and, reduce, the, fruit, s, quality, one, of, the, biggest, effects, that, viral, infections, have, on, papaya, is, taste, as, of, 2010, the, only, way, to, protect, papaya, from, this, virus, is, genetic, modification, the, papaya, mosaic, virus, destroys, the, plant, until, only, a, small, tuft, of, leaves, is, left, the, virus, affects, both, the, leaves, of, the, plant, and, the, fruit, leaves, show, thin, irregular, dark, green, lines, around, the, borders, and, clear, areas, around, the, veins, the, more, severely, affected, leaves, are, irregular, and, linear, in, shape, the, virus, can, infect, the, fruit, at, any, stage, of, its, maturity, fruits, as, young, as, two, weeks, old, have, been, spotted, with, dark, green, ringspots, about, 1, inch, 25, mm, in, diameter, rings, on, the, fruit, are, most, likely, seen, on, either, the, stem, end, or, the, blossom, end, in, the, early, stages, of, the, ringspots, the, rings, tend, to, be, many, closed, circles, but, as, the, disease, develops, the, rings, increase, in, diameter, consisting, of, one, large, ring, the, difference, between, the, ringspot, and, the, mosaic, viruses, is, the, ripe, fruit, in, the, ringspot, has, a, mottling, of, colors, and, the, mosaic, does, not, the, fungus, anthracnose, is, known, to, attack, papaya, especially, mature, fruits, the, disease, starts, small, with, very, few, signs, such, as, water, soaked, spots, on, ripening, fruits, the, spots, become, sunken, turn, brown, or, black, and, may, get, bigger, in, some, of, the, older, spots, the, fungus, may, produce, pink, spores, the, fruit, ends, up, being, soft, and, having, an, off, flavor, because, the, fungus, grows, into, the, fruit, the, fungus, powdery, mildew, occurs, as, a, superficial, white, presence, on, the, leaf, s, surface, which, is, easily, recognized, tiny, light, yellow, spots, begin, on, the, lower, surfaces, of, the, leaf, as, the, disease, starts, to, make, its, way, the, spots, enlarge, and, white, powdery, growth, appears, on, the, leaves, the, infection, usually, appears, at, the, upper, leaf, surface, as, white, fungal, growth, powdery, mildew, is, not, as, severe, as, other, diseases, the, fungus, like, oomycete, phytophthora, causes, damping, off, root, rot, stem, rot, stem, girdling, and, fruit, rot, damping, off, happens, in, young, plants, by, wilting, and, death, the, spots, on, established, plants, start, as, white, water, soaked, lesions, at, the, fruit, and, branch, scars, these, spots, enlarge, and, eventually, cause, death, the, disease, s, most, dangerous, feature, is, the, fruit, s, infection, which, may, be, toxic, to, consumers, the, roots, can, also, be, severely, and, rapidly, infected, causing, the, plant, to, brown, and, wilt, away, collapsing, within, days, the, papaya, fruit, fly, lays, its, eggs, inside, of, the, fruit, possibly, up, to, 100, or, more, eggs, the, eggs, usually, hatch, within, 12, days, when, they, begin, to, feed, on, seeds, and, interior, parts, of, the, fruit, when, the, larvae, mature, usually, 16, days, after, being, hatched, they, eat, their, way, out, of, the, fruit, drop, to, the, ground, and, pupate, in, the, soil, to, emerge, within, one, to, two, weeks, later, as, mature, flies, the, infected, papaya, turns, yellow, and, drops, to, the, ground, after, the, papaya, fruit, fly, infestation, the, two, spotted, spider, mite, is, a, 0, 5, mm, long, brown, or, orange, red, or, a, green, greenish, yellow, translucent, oval, pest, they, all, have, needle, like, piercing, sucking, mouthparts, and, feed, by, piercing, the, plant, tissue, with, their, mouthparts, usually, on, the, underside, of, the, plant, the, spider, mites, spin, fine, threads, of, webbing, on, the, host, plant, and, when, they, remove, the, sap, the, mesophyll, tissue, collapses, and, a, small, chlorotic, spot, forms, at, the, feeding, sites, the, leaves, of, the, papaya, fruit, turn, yellow, gray, or, bronze, if, the, spider, mites, are, not, controlled, they, can, cause, the, death, of, the, fruit, the, papaya, whitefly, lays, yellow, oval, eggs, that, appear, dusted, on, the, undersides, of, the, leaves, they, eat, papaya, leaves, therefore, damaging, the, fruit, there, the, eggs, developed, into, flies, in, three, stages, called, instars, the, first, instar, has, well, developed, legs, and, is, the, only, mobile, immature, life, stage, the, crawlers, insert, their, mouthparts, in, the, lower, surfaces, of, the, leaf, when, they, find, it, suitable, and, usually, do, not, move, again, in, this, stage, the, next, instars, are, flattened, oval, and, scale, like, in, the, final, stage, the, pupal, whiteflies, are, more, convex, with, large, conspicuously, red, eyes, papayas, are, one, of, the, most, common, hosts, for, fruit, flies, like, a, suspensa, which, lay, their, eggs, in, overripe, or, spoiled, papayas, the, larvae, of, these, flies, then, consume, the, fruit, to, gain, nutrients, until, they, can, proceed, into, the, pupal, stage, this, parasitism, has, led, to, extensive, economic, costs, for, nations, in, central, america, historical, accounts, from, 18th, century, travelers, and, botanists, suggested, that, papaya, seeds, were, transported, from, the, caribbean, to, malacca, and, then, to, india, from, malacca, or, the, philippines, papaya, spread, throughout, asia, and, into, the, south, pacific, region, credit, for, introducing, papaya, to, hawaii, is, often, given, to, francisco, de, paula, mar, n, a, spanish, explorer, and, horticulturist, who, brought, it, from, the, marquesas, islands, in, the, early, 1800s, since, then, papaya, cultivation, has, expanded, to, all, tropical, countries, and, many, subtropical, regions, worldwide, today, papaya, is, grown, extensively, across, the, globe, owing, to, its, adaptability, to, various, climates, and, its, popularity, as, a, tropical, fruit, papaya, plants, grow, in, three, sexes, male, female, and, hermaphrodite, the, male, produces, only, pollen, never, fruit, the, female, produces, small, inedible, fruits, unless, pollinated, the, hermaphrodite, can, self, pollinate, since, its, flowers, contain, both, male, stamens, and, female, ovaries, almost, all, commercial, papaya, orchards, contain, only, hermaphrodites, originally, from, southern, mexico, particularly, chiapas, and, veracruz, central, america, northern, south, america, and, southern, florida, the, papaya, is, now, cultivated, in, most, tropical, countries, in, cultivation, it, grows, rapidly, fruiting, within, three, years, it, is, however, highly, frost, sensitive, limiting, its, production, to, tropical, climates, temperatures, below, 2, c, 29, f, are, greatly, harmful, if, not, fatal, in, florida, california, and, texas, growth, is, generally, limited, to, the, southern, parts, of, those, states, it, prefers, sandy, well, drained, soil, as, standing, water, can, kill, the, plant, within, 24, hours, two, kinds, of, papayas, are, commonly, grown, one, has, sweet, red, or, orange, flesh, and, the, other, has, yellow, flesh, in, australia, these, are, called, red, papaya, and, yellow, papaw, respectively, either, kind, picked, green, is, called, a, green, papaya, the, large, fruited, red, fleshed, maradol, sunrise, and, caribbean, red, papayas, often, sold, in, u, s, markets, are, commonly, grown, in, mexico, and, belize, in, 2011, philippine, researchers, reported, that, by, hybridizing, papaya, with, vasconcellea, quercifolia, they, had, developed, papaya, resistant, to, papaya, ringspot, virus, prv, part, of, a, long, line, of, attempts, to, transfer, resistance, from, vasconcellea, species, into, papaya, carica, papaya, was, the, first, transgenic, fruit, tree, to, have, its, genome, sequenced, in, response, to, the, papaya, ringspot, virus, outbreak, in, hawaii, in, 1998, genetically, altered, papaya, were, approved, and, brought, to, market, including, sunup, and, rainbow, varieties, varieties, resistant, to, prv, have, some, dna, of, this, virus, incorporated, into, the, plant, s, dna, as, of, 2010, 80, of, hawaiian, papaya, plants, were, genetically, modified, the, modifications, were, made, by, university, of, hawaii, scientists, who, made, the, modified, seeds, available, to, farmers, without, charge, in, transgenic, papaya, resistance, is, produced, by, inserting, the, viral, coat, protein, gene, into, the, plant, s, genome, doing, so, seems, to, cause, a, similar, protective, reaction, in, the, plant, to, cross, protection, which, involves, using, an, attenuated, virus, to, protect, against, a, more, dangerous, strain, conventional, varieties, of, transgenic, papaya, has, reduced, resistance, against, heterologous, not, closely, related, to, the, coat, gene, source, strains, forcing, different, localities, to, develop, their, own, transgenic, varieties, as, of, 2016, one, transgenic, line, appears, able, to, deal, with, three, different, heterologous, strains, in, addition, to, its, source, in, 2022, global, production, of, papayas, was, 13, 8, million, tonnes, led, by, india, with, 38, of, the, world, total, table, global, papaya, production, grew, significantly, over, the, early, 21st, century, mainly, as, a, result, of, increased, production, in, india, and, demand, by, the, united, states, the, united, states, is, the, largest, importer, of, papayas, worldwide, in, south, africa, papaya, orchards, yield, up, to, 100, tonnes, of, fruit, per, hectare, papaya, releases, a, latex, fluid, when, not, ripe, possibly, causing, irritation, and, an, allergic, reaction, in, some, people, because, the, enzyme, papain, acts, as, an, allergen, in, sensitive, individuals, meat, that, has, been, tenderized, with, it, may, induce, an, allergic, reaction, the, ripe, fruit, of, the, papaya, is, usually, eaten, raw, without, skin, or, seeds, the, black, seeds, are, edible, and, have, a, sharp, spicy, taste, the, unripe, green, fruit, is, usually, cooked, due, to, its, latex, content, both, green, papaya, fruit, and, its, latex, are, rich, in, papain, a, cysteine, protease, used, for, tenderizing, meat, and, other, proteins, as, practiced, currently, by, indigenous, americans, people, of, the, caribbean, region, and, the, philippines, it, is, included, as, a, component, in, some, powdered, meat, tenderizers, papaya, is, not, suitable, for, foods, which, set, due, to, gelatin, such, as, jelly, or, aspic, because, the, enzymatic, properties, of, papain, prevent, gelatin, from, setting, raw, papaya, pulp, contains, 88, water, 11, carbohydrates, and, negligible, fat, and, protein, table, in, a, 100, g, amount, papaya, fruit, provides, 43, kilocalories, and, is, a, significant, source, of, vitamin, c, 75, of, the, daily, value, dv, and, a, moderate, source, of, folate, 10, dv, but, otherwise, has, a, low, content, of, nutrients, see, table, green, papaya, is, used, in, southeast, asian, cooking, both, raw, and, cooked, in, some, parts, of, asia, the, young, leaves, of, the, papaya, are, steamed, and, eaten, like, spinach, in, myanmar, the, unripe, papaya, are, cut, into, slices, and, dipped, into, sour, fermented, or, spicy, seasonings, and, dips, in, myanmar, and, thai, recipes, the, unripe, papaya, are, cut, into, thinner, slices, to, make, papaya, salad, the, reason, the, unripe, papaya, is, used, is, because, of, the, firmer, and, crunchier, texture, papayas, became, a, part, of, filipino, cuisine, after, being, introduced, to, the, islands, via, the, manila, galleons, unripe, or, nearly, ripe, papayas, with, orange, flesh, but, still, hard, and, green, are, julienned, and, are, commonly, pickled, into, atchara, which, is, ubiquitous, as, a, side, dish, to, salty, dishes, nearly, ripe, papayas, can, also, be, eaten, fresh, as, ensaladang, papaya, papaya, salad, or, cubed, and, eaten, dipped, in, vinegar, or, salt, green, papaya, is, also, a, common, ingredient, or, filling, in, various, savory, dishes, such, as, okoy, tinola, ginataan, lumpia, and, empanada, especially, in, the, cuisines, of, northern, luzon, in, indonesian, cuisine, the, unripe, green, fruits, and, young, leaves, are, boiled, for, use, as, part, of, lalab, salad, while, the, flower, buds, are, saut, ed, and, stir, fried, with, chilies, and, green, tomatoes, as, minahasan, papaya, flower, vegetable, dish, in, lao, and, thai, cuisine, unripe, green, papayas, are, used, to, make, a, type, of, spicy, salad, known, in, laos, as, tam, maak, hoong, and, in, thailand, as, som, tam, it, is, also, used, in, thai, curries, such, as, kaeng, som, in, brazil, and, paraguay, the, unripe, fruits, are, used, to, make, sweets, or, preserves, in, traditional, medicine, papaya, leaves, have, been, believed, useful, as, a, treatment, for, malaria, an, abortifacient, a, purgative, or, smoked, to, relieve, asthma
