hypoxia, is, a, condition, in, which, the, body, or, a, region, of, the, body, is, deprived, of, adequate, oxygen, supply, at, the, tissue, level, hypoxia, may, be, classified, as, either, generalized, affecting, the, whole, body, or, local, affecting, a, region, of, the, body, although, hypoxia, is, often, a, pathological, condition, variations, in, arterial, oxygen, concentrations, can, be, part, of, the, normal, physiology, for, example, during, strenuous, physical, exercise, hypoxia, differs, from, hypoxemia, and, anoxemia, in, that, hypoxia, refers, to, a, state, in, which, oxygen, present, in, a, tissue, or, the, whole, body, is, insufficient, whereas, hypoxemia, and, anoxemia, refer, specifically, to, states, that, have, low, or, no, oxygen, in, the, blood, hypoxia, in, which, there, is, complete, absence, of, oxygen, supply, is, referred, to, as, anoxia, hypoxia, can, be, due, to, external, causes, when, the, breathing, gas, is, hypoxic, or, internal, causes, such, as, reduced, effectiveness, of, gas, transfer, in, the, lungs, reduced, capacity, of, the, blood, to, carry, oxygen, compromised, general, or, local, perfusion, or, inability, of, the, affected, tissues, to, extract, oxygen, from, or, metabolically, process, an, adequate, supply, of, oxygen, from, an, adequately, oxygenated, blood, supply, generalized, hypoxia, occurs, in, healthy, people, when, they, ascend, to, high, altitude, where, it, causes, altitude, sickness, leading, to, potentially, fatal, complications, high, altitude, pulmonary, edema, hape, and, high, altitude, cerebral, edema, hace, hypoxia, also, occurs, in, healthy, individuals, when, breathing, inappropriate, mixtures, of, gases, with, a, low, oxygen, content, e, g, while, diving, underwater, especially, when, using, malfunctioning, closed, circuit, rebreather, systems, that, control, the, amount, of, oxygen, in, the, supplied, air, mild, non, damaging, intermittent, hypoxia, is, used, intentionally, during, altitude, training, to, develop, an, athletic, performance, adaptation, at, both, the, systemic, and, cellular, level, hypoxia, is, a, common, complication, of, preterm, birth, in, newborn, infants, because, the, lungs, develop, late, in, pregnancy, premature, infants, frequently, possess, underdeveloped, lungs, to, improve, blood, oxygenation, infants, at, risk, of, hypoxia, may, be, placed, inside, incubators, that, provide, warmth, humidity, and, supplemental, oxygen, more, serious, cases, are, treated, with, continuous, positive, airway, pressure, cpap, hypoxia, exists, when, there, is, a, reduced, amount, of, oxygen, in, the, tissues, of, the, body, hypoxemia, refers, to, a, reduction, in, arterial, oxygenation, below, the, normal, range, regardless, of, whether, gas, exchange, is, impaired, in, the, lung, arterial, oxygen, content, c, a, o, 2, which, represents, the, amount, of, oxygen, delivered, to, the, tissues, is, adequate, or, tissue, hypoxia, exists, the, classification, categories, are, not, always, mutually, exclusive, and, hypoxia, can, be, a, consequence, of, a, wide, variety, of, causes, intermittent, hypoxic, training, induces, mild, generalized, hypoxia, for, short, periods, as, a, training, method, to, improve, sporting, performance, this, is, not, considered, a, medical, condition, acute, cerebral, hypoxia, leading, to, blackout, can, occur, during, freediving, this, is, a, consequence, of, prolonged, voluntary, apnea, underwater, and, generally, occurs, in, trained, athletes, in, good, health, and, good, physical, condition, hypoxia, may, affect, the, whole, body, or, just, some, parts, the, term, generalized, hypoxia, may, refer, to, hypoxia, affecting, the, whole, body, or, may, be, used, as, a, synonym, for, hypoxic, hypoxia, which, occurs, when, there, is, insufficient, oxygen, in, the, breathing, gas, to, oxygenate, the, blood, to, a, level, that, will, adequately, support, normal, metabolic, processes, and, which, will, inherently, affect, all, perfused, tissues, the, symptoms, of, generalized, hypoxia, depend, on, its, severity, and, acceleration, of, onset, in, the, case, of, altitude, sickness, where, hypoxia, develops, gradually, the, symptoms, include, fatigue, numbness, tingling, of, extremities, nausea, and, cerebral, hypoxia, these, symptoms, are, often, difficult, to, identify, but, early, detection, of, symptoms, can, be, critical, in, severe, hypoxia, or, hypoxia, of, very, rapid, onset, ataxia, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, behavioral, change, severe, headaches, reduced, level, of, consciousness, papilloedema, breathlessness, pallor, tachycardia, and, pulmonary, hypertension, eventually, leading, to, the, late, signs, cyanosis, slow, heart, rate, cor, pulmonale, and, low, blood, pressure, followed, by, heart, failure, eventually, leading, to, shock, and, death, because, hemoglobin, is, a, darker, red, when, it, is, not, bound, to, oxygen, deoxyhemoglobin, as, opposed, to, the, rich, red, color, that, it, has, when, bound, to, oxygen, oxyhemoglobin, when, seen, through, the, skin, it, has, an, increased, tendency, to, reflect, blue, light, back, to, the, eye, in, cases, where, the, oxygen, is, displaced, by, another, molecule, such, as, carbon, monoxide, the, skin, may, appear, cherry, red, instead, of, cyanotic, hypoxia, can, cause, premature, birth, and, injure, the, liver, among, other, deleterious, effects, hypoxia, that, is, localized, to, a, region, of, the, body, such, as, an, organ, or, a, limb, is, usually, the, consequence, of, ischemia, the, reduced, perfusion, to, that, organ, or, limb, and, may, not, necessarily, be, associated, with, general, hypoxemia, a, locally, reduced, perfusion, is, generally, caused, by, an, increased, resistance, to, flow, through, the, blood, vessels, of, the, affected, area, ischemia, is, a, restriction, in, blood, supply, to, any, tissue, muscle, group, or, organ, causing, a, shortage, of, oxygen, ischemia, is, generally, caused, by, problems, with, blood, vessels, with, resultant, damage, to, or, dysfunction, of, tissue, i, e, hypoxia, and, microvascular, dysfunction, it, also, means, local, hypoxia, in, a, given, part, of, a, body, sometimes, resulting, from, vascular, occlusion, such, as, vasoconstriction, thrombosis, or, embolism, ischemia, comprises, not, only, insufficiency, of, oxygen, but, also, reduced, availability, of, nutrients, and, inadequate, removal, of, metabolic, wastes, ischemia, can, be, a, partial, poor, perfusion, or, total, blockage, compartment, syndrome, is, a, condition, in, which, increased, pressure, within, one, of, the, body, s, anatomical, compartments, results, in, insufficient, blood, supply, to, tissue, within, that, space, there, are, two, main, types, acute, and, chronic, compartments, of, the, leg, or, arm, are, most, commonly, involved, if, tissue, is, not, being, perfused, properly, it, may, feel, cold, and, appear, pale, if, severe, hypoxia, can, result, in, cyanosis, a, blue, discoloration, of, the, skin, if, hypoxia, is, very, severe, a, tissue, may, eventually, become, gangrenous, any, living, tissue, can, be, affected, by, hypoxia, but, some, are, particularly, sensitive, or, have, more, noticeable, or, notable, consequences, cerebral, hypoxia, is, hypoxia, specifically, involving, the, brain, the, four, categories, of, cerebral, hypoxia, in, order, of, increasing, severity, are, diffuse, cerebral, hypoxia, dch, focal, cerebral, ischemia, cerebral, infarction, and, global, cerebral, ischemia, prolonged, hypoxia, induces, neuronal, cell, death, via, apoptosis, resulting, in, a, hypoxic, brain, injury, oxygen, deprivation, can, be, hypoxic, reduced, general, oxygen, availability, or, ischemic, oxygen, deprivation, due, to, a, disruption, in, blood, flow, in, origin, brain, injury, as, a, result, of, oxygen, deprivation, is, generally, termed, hypoxic, injury, hypoxic, ischemic, encephalopathy, hie, is, a, condition, that, occurs, when, the, entire, brain, is, deprived, of, an, adequate, oxygen, supply, but, the, deprivation, is, not, total, while, hie, is, associated, in, most, cases, with, oxygen, deprivation, in, the, neonate, due, to, birth, asphyxia, it, can, occur, in, all, age, groups, and, is, often, a, complication, of, cardiac, arrest, although, corneal, hypoxia, can, arise, from, any, of, several, causes, it, is, primarily, attributable, to, the, prolonged, use, of, contact, lenses, the, corneas, are, not, perfused, and, get, their, oxygen, from, the, atmosphere, by, diffusion, impermeable, contact, lenses, form, a, barrier, to, this, diffusion, and, therefore, can, cause, damage, to, the, corneas, symptoms, may, include, irritation, excessive, tearing, and, blurred, vision, the, sequelae, of, corneal, hypoxia, include, punctate, keratitis, corneal, neovascularization, and, epithelial, microcysts, intrauterine, hypoxia, also, known, as, fetal, hypoxia, occurs, when, the, fetus, is, deprived, of, an, adequate, supply, of, oxygen, it, may, be, due, to, a, variety, of, reasons, such, as, prolapse, or, occlusion, of, the, umbilical, cord, placental, infarction, maternal, diabetes, prepregnancy, or, gestational, diabetes, and, maternal, smoking, intrauterine, growth, restriction, may, cause, or, be, the, result, of, hypoxia, intrauterine, hypoxia, can, cause, cellular, damage, that, occurs, within, the, central, nervous, system, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, this, results, in, an, increased, mortality, rate, including, an, increased, risk, of, sudden, infant, death, syndrome, sids, oxygen, deprivation, in, the, fetus, and, neonate, have, been, implicated, as, either, a, primary, or, as, a, contributing, risk, factor, in, numerous, neurological, and, neuropsychiatric, disorders, such, as, epilepsy, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, eating, disorders, and, cerebral, palsy, tumor, hypoxia, is, the, situation, where, tumor, cells, have, been, deprived, of, oxygen, as, a, tumor, grows, it, rapidly, outgrows, its, blood, supply, leaving, portions, of, the, tumor, with, regions, where, the, oxygen, concentration, is, significantly, lower, than, in, healthy, tissues, hypoxic, microenvironements, in, solid, tumors, are, a, result, of, available, oxygen, being, consumed, within, 70, to, 150, m, of, tumour, vasculature, by, rapidly, proliferating, tumor, cells, thus, limiting, the, amount, of, oxygen, available, to, diffuse, further, into, the, tumor, tissue, the, severity, of, hypoxia, is, related, to, tumor, types, and, varies, between, different, types, research, has, shown, that, the, level, of, oxygenation, in, hypoxic, tumor, tissues, is, poorer, than, normal, tissues, and, it, is, reported, somewhere, between, 1, 2, o2, in, order, to, support, continuous, growth, and, proliferation, in, challenging, hypoxic, environments, cancer, cells, are, found, to, alter, their, metabolism, furthermore, hypoxia, is, known, to, change, cell, behavior, and, is, associated, with, extracellular, matrix, remodeling, and, increased, migratory, and, metastatic, behavior, tumour, hypoxia, is, usually, associated, with, highly, malignant, tumours, which, frequently, do, not, respond, well, to, treatment, in, acute, exposure, to, hypoxic, hypoxia, on, the, vestibular, system, and, the, visuo, vestibular, interactions, the, gain, of, the, vestibulo, ocular, reflex, vor, decreases, under, mild, hypoxia, at, altitude, postural, control, is, also, disturbed, by, hypoxia, at, altitude, postural, sway, is, increased, and, there, is, a, correlation, between, hypoxic, stress, and, adaptive, tracking, performance, arterial, oxygen, tension, can, be, measured, by, blood, gas, analysis, of, an, arterial, blood, sample, and, less, reliably, by, pulse, oximetry, which, is, not, a, complete, measure, of, circulatory, oxygen, sufficiency, if, there, is, insufficient, blood, flow, or, insufficient, hemoglobin, in, the, blood, anemia, tissues, can, be, hypoxic, even, when, there, is, high, arterial, oxygen, saturation, oxygen, passively, diffuses, in, the, lung, alveoli, according, to, a, concentration, gradient, also, referred, to, as, a, partial, pressure, gradient, inhaled, air, rapidly, reaches, saturation, with, water, vapour, which, slightly, reduces, the, partial, pressures, of, the, other, components, oxygen, diffuses, from, the, inhaled, air, to, arterial, blood, where, its, partial, pressure, is, around, 100, mmhg, 13, 3, kpa, in, the, blood, oxygen, is, bound, to, hemoglobin, a, protein, in, red, blood, cells, the, binding, capacity, of, hemoglobin, is, influenced, by, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, in, the, environment, as, described, by, the, oxygen, hemoglobin, dissociation, curve, a, smaller, amount, of, oxygen, is, transported, in, solution, in, the, blood, in, systemic, tissues, oxygen, again, diffuses, down, a, concentration, gradient, into, cells, and, their, mitochondria, where, it, is, used, to, produce, energy, in, conjunction, with, the, breakdown, of, glucose, fats, and, some, amino, acids, hypoxia, can, result, from, a, failure, at, any, stage, in, the, delivery, of, oxygen, to, cells, this, can, include, low, partial, pressures, of, oxygen, in, the, breathing, gas, problems, with, diffusion, of, oxygen, in, the, lungs, through, the, interface, between, air, and, blood, insufficient, available, hemoglobin, problems, with, blood, flow, to, the, end, user, tissue, problems, with, the, breathing, cycle, regarding, rate, and, volume, and, physiological, and, mechanical, dead, space, experimentally, oxygen, diffusion, becomes, rate, limiting, when, arterial, oxygen, partial, pressure, falls, to, 60, mmhg, 5, 3, kpa, or, below, almost, all, the, oxygen, in, the, blood, is, bound, to, hemoglobin, so, interfering, with, this, carrier, molecule, limits, oxygen, delivery, to, the, perfused, tissues, hemoglobin, increases, the, oxygen, carrying, capacity, of, blood, by, about, 40, fold, with, the, ability, of, hemoglobin, to, carry, oxygen, influenced, by, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, in, the, local, environment, a, relationship, described, in, the, oxygen, hemoglobin, dissociation, curve, when, the, ability, of, hemoglobin, to, carry, oxygen, is, degraded, a, hypoxic, state, can, result, ischemia, meaning, insufficient, blood, flow, to, a, tissue, can, also, result, in, hypoxia, in, the, affected, tissues, this, is, called, ischemic, hypoxia, ischemia, can, be, caused, by, an, embolism, a, heart, attack, that, decreases, overall, blood, flow, trauma, to, a, tissue, that, results, in, damage, reducing, perfusion, and, a, variety, of, other, causes, a, consequence, of, insufficient, blood, flow, causing, local, hypoxia, is, gangrene, that, occurs, in, diabetes, diseases, such, as, peripheral, vascular, disease, can, also, result, in, local, hypoxia, symptoms, are, worse, when, a, limb, is, used, increasing, the, oxygen, demand, in, the, active, muscles, pain, may, also, be, felt, as, a, result, of, increased, hydrogen, ions, leading, to, a, decrease, in, blood, ph, acidosis, created, as, a, result, of, anaerobic, metabolism, g, loc, or, g, force, induced, loss, of, consciousness, is, a, special, case, of, ischemic, hypoxia, which, occurs, when, the, body, is, subjected, to, high, enough, acceleration, sustained, for, long, enough, to, lower, cerebral, blood, pressure, and, circulation, to, the, point, where, loss, of, consciousness, occurs, due, to, cerebral, hypoxia, the, human, body, is, most, sensitive, to, longitudinal, acceleration, towards, the, head, as, this, causes, the, largest, hydrostatic, pressure, deficit, in, the, head, this, refers, specifically, to, hypoxic, states, where, the, arterial, content, of, oxygen, is, insufficient, this, can, be, caused, by, alterations, in, respiratory, drive, such, as, in, respiratory, alkalosis, physiological, or, pathological, shunting, of, blood, diseases, interfering, in, lung, function, resulting, in, a, ventilation, perfusion, mismatch, such, as, a, pulmonary, embolus, or, alterations, in, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, in, the, environment, or, lung, alveoli, such, as, may, occur, at, altitude, or, when, diving, common, disorders, that, can, cause, respiratory, dysfunction, include, trauma, to, the, head, and, spinal, cord, nontraumatic, acute, myelopathies, demyelinating, disorders, stroke, guillain, barr, syndrome, and, myasthenia, gravis, these, dysfunctions, may, necessitate, mechanical, ventilation, some, chronic, neuromuscular, disorders, such, as, motor, neuron, disease, and, muscular, dystrophy, may, require, ventilatory, support, in, advanced, stages, carbon, monoxide, competes, with, oxygen, for, binding, sites, on, hemoglobin, molecules, as, carbon, monoxide, binds, with, hemoglobin, hundreds, of, times, tighter, than, oxygen, it, can, prevent, the, carriage, of, oxygen, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, can, occur, acutely, as, with, smoke, intoxication, or, over, a, period, of, time, as, with, cigarette, smoking, due, to, physiological, processes, carbon, monoxide, is, maintained, at, a, resting, level, of, 4, 6, ppm, this, is, increased, in, urban, areas, 7, 13, ppm, and, in, smokers, 20, 40, ppm, a, carbon, monoxide, level, of, 40, ppm, is, equivalent, to, a, reduction, in, hemoglobin, levels, of, 10, g, l, carbon, monoxide, has, a, second, toxic, effect, namely, removing, the, allosteric, shift, of, the, oxygen, dissociation, curve, and, shifting, the, foot, of, the, curve, to, the, left, in, so, doing, the, hemoglobin, is, less, likely, to, release, its, oxygen, at, the, peripheral, tissues, certain, abnormal, hemoglobin, variants, also, have, higher, than, normal, affinity, for, oxygen, and, so, are, also, poor, at, delivering, oxygen, to, the, periphery, atmospheric, pressure, reduces, with, altitude, and, proportionally, so, does, the, oxygen, content, of, the, air, the, reduction, in, the, partial, pressure, of, inspired, oxygen, at, higher, altitudes, lowers, the, oxygen, saturation, of, the, blood, ultimately, leading, to, hypoxia, the, clinical, features, of, altitude, sickness, include, sleep, problems, dizziness, headache, and, oedema, the, breathing, gas, may, contain, an, insufficient, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, such, situations, may, lead, to, unconsciousness, without, symptoms, since, carbon, dioxide, levels, remain, normal, and, the, human, body, senses, pure, hypoxia, poorly, hypoxic, breathing, gases, can, be, defined, as, mixtures, with, a, lower, oxygen, fraction, than, air, though, gases, containing, sufficient, oxygen, to, reliably, maintain, consciousness, at, normal, sea, level, atmospheric, pressure, may, be, described, as, normoxic, even, when, the, oxygen, fraction, is, slightly, below, normoxic, hypoxic, breathing, gas, mixtures, in, this, context, are, those, which, will, not, reliably, maintain, consciousness, at, sea, level, pressure, one, of, the, most, widespread, circumstances, of, exposure, to, hypoxic, breathing, gas, is, ascent, to, altitudes, where, the, ambient, pressure, drops, sufficiently, to, reduce, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, to, hypoxic, levels, gases, with, as, little, as, 2, oxygen, by, volume, in, a, helium, diluent, are, used, for, deep, diving, operations, the, ambient, pressure, at, 190, msw, is, sufficient, to, provide, a, partial, pressure, of, about, 0, 4, bar, which, is, suitable, for, saturation, diving, as, the, divers, are, decompressed, the, breathing, gas, must, be, oxygenated, to, maintain, a, breathable, atmosphere, it, is, also, possible, for, the, breathing, gas, for, diving, to, have, a, dynamically, controlled, oxygen, partial, pressure, known, as, a, set, point, which, is, maintained, in, the, breathing, gas, circuit, of, a, diving, rebreather, by, addition, of, oxygen, and, diluent, gas, to, maintain, the, desired, oxygen, partial, pressure, at, a, safe, level, between, hypoxic, and, hyperoxic, at, the, ambient, pressure, due, to, the, current, depth, a, malfunction, of, the, control, system, may, lead, to, the, gas, mixture, becoming, hypoxic, at, the, current, depth, a, special, case, of, hypoxic, breathing, gas, is, encountered, in, deep, freediving, where, the, partial, pressure, of, the, oxygen, in, the, lung, gas, is, depleted, during, the, dive, but, remains, sufficient, at, depth, and, when, it, drops, during, ascent, it, becomes, too, hypoxic, to, maintain, consciousness, and, the, diver, loses, consciousness, before, reaching, the, surface, hypoxic, gases, may, also, occur, in, industrial, mining, and, firefighting, environments, some, of, these, may, also, be, toxic, or, narcotic, others, are, just, asphyxiant, some, are, recognisable, by, smell, others, are, odourless, inert, gas, asphyxiation, may, be, deliberate, with, use, of, a, suicide, bag, accidental, death, has, occurred, in, cases, where, concentrations, of, nitrogen, in, controlled, atmospheres, or, methane, in, mines, has, not, been, detected, or, appreciated, hemoglobin, s, function, can, also, be, lost, by, chemically, oxidizing, its, iron, atom, to, its, ferric, form, this, form, of, inactive, hemoglobin, is, called, methemoglobin, and, can, be, made, by, ingesting, sodium, nitrite, as, well, as, certain, drugs, and, other, chemicals, hemoglobin, plays, a, substantial, role, in, carrying, oxygen, throughout, the, body, and, when, it, is, deficient, anemia, can, result, causing, anaemic, hypoxia, if, tissue, oxygenation, is, decreased, iron, deficiency, is, the, most, common, cause, of, anemia, as, iron, is, used, in, the, synthesis, of, hemoglobin, less, hemoglobin, will, be, synthesised, when, there, is, less, iron, due, to, insufficient, intake, or, poor, absorption, 997, 99, anemia, is, typically, a, chronic, process, that, is, compensated, over, time, by, increased, levels, of, red, blood, cells, via, upregulated, erythropoetin, a, chronic, hypoxic, state, can, result, from, a, poorly, compensated, anaemia, 997, 99, histotoxic, hypoxia, also, called, histoxic, hypoxia, is, the, inability, of, cells, to, take, up, or, use, oxygen, from, the, bloodstream, despite, physiologically, normal, delivery, of, oxygen, to, such, cells, and, tissues, histotoxic, hypoxia, results, from, tissue, poisoning, such, as, that, caused, by, cyanide, which, acts, by, inhibiting, cytochrome, oxidase, and, certain, other, poisons, like, hydrogen, sulfide, byproduct, of, sewage, and, used, in, leather, tanning, tissue, hypoxia, from, low, oxygen, delivery, may, be, due, to, low, haemoglobin, concentration, anaemic, hypoxia, low, cardiac, output, stagnant, hypoxia, or, low, haemoglobin, saturation, hypoxic, hypoxia, the, consequence, of, oxygen, deprivation, in, tissues, is, a, switch, to, anaerobic, metabolism, at, the, cellular, level, as, such, reduced, systemic, blood, flow, may, result, in, increased, serum, lactate, serum, lactate, levels, have, been, correlated, with, illness, severity, and, mortality, in, critically, ill, adults, and, in, ventilated, neonates, with, respiratory, distress, all, vertebrates, must, maintain, oxygen, homeostasis, to, survive, and, have, evolved, physiological, systems, to, ensure, adequate, oxygenation, of, all, tissues, in, air, breathing, vertebrates, this, is, based, on, lungs, to, acquire, the, oxygen, hemoglobin, in, red, corpuscles, to, transport, it, a, vasculature, to, distribute, and, a, heart, to, deliver, short, term, variations, in, the, levels, of, oxygenation, are, sensed, by, chemoreceptor, cells, which, respond, by, activating, existing, proteins, and, over, longer, terms, by, regulation, of, gene, transcription, hypoxia, is, also, involved, in, the, pathogenesis, of, some, common, and, severe, pathologies, the, most, common, causes, of, death, in, an, aging, population, include, myocardial, infarction, stroke, and, cancer, these, diseases, share, a, common, feature, that, limitation, of, oxygen, availability, contributes, to, the, development, of, the, pathology, cells, and, organisms, are, also, able, to, respond, adaptively, to, hypoxic, conditions, in, ways, that, help, them, to, cope, with, these, adverse, conditions, several, systems, can, sense, oxygen, concentration, and, may, respond, with, adaptations, to, acute, and, long, term, hypoxia, the, systems, activated, by, hypoxia, usually, help, cells, to, survive, and, overcome, the, hypoxic, conditions, erythropoietin, which, is, produced, in, larger, quantities, by, the, kidneys, under, hypoxic, conditions, is, an, essential, hormone, that, stimulates, production, of, red, blood, cells, which, are, the, primary, transporter, of, blood, oxygen, and, glycolytic, enzymes, are, involved, in, anaerobic, atp, formation, hypoxia, inducible, factors, hifs, are, transcription, factors, that, respond, to, decreases, in, available, oxygen, in, the, cellular, environment, or, hypoxia, the, hif, signaling, cascade, mediates, the, effects, of, hypoxia, on, the, cell, hypoxia, often, keeps, cells, from, differentiating, however, hypoxia, promotes, the, formation, of, blood, vessels, and, is, important, for, the, formation, of, a, vascular, system, in, embryos, and, tumors, the, hypoxia, in, wounds, also, promotes, the, migration, of, keratinocytes, and, the, restoration, of, the, epithelium, it, is, therefore, not, surprising, that, hif, 1, modulation, was, identified, as, a, promising, treatment, paradigm, in, wound, healing, exposure, of, a, tissue, to, repeated, short, periods, of, hypoxia, between, periods, of, normal, oxygen, levels, influences, the, tissue, s, later, response, to, prolonged, ischaemic, exposure, thus, is, known, as, ischaemic, preconditioning, and, it, is, known, to, occur, in, many, tissues, if, oxygen, delivery, to, cells, is, insufficient, for, the, demand, hypoxia, electrons, will, be, shifted, to, pyruvic, acid, in, the, process, of, lactic, acid, fermentation, this, temporary, measure, anaerobic, metabolism, allows, small, amounts, of, energy, to, be, released, lactic, acid, build, up, in, tissues, and, blood, is, a, sign, of, inadequate, mitochondrial, oxygenation, which, may, be, due, to, hypoxemia, poor, blood, flow, e, g, shock, or, a, combination, of, both, if, severe, or, prolonged, it, could, lead, to, cell, death, in, humans, hypoxia, is, detected, by, the, peripheral, chemoreceptors, in, the, carotid, body, and, aortic, body, with, the, carotid, body, chemoreceptors, being, the, major, mediators, of, reflex, responses, to, hypoxia, this, response, does, not, control, ventilation, rate, at, normal, p, o, 2, but, below, normal, the, activity, of, neurons, innervating, these, receptors, increases, dramatically, so, much, as, to, override, the, signals, from, central, chemoreceptors, in, the, hypothalamus, increasing, p, o, 2, despite, a, falling, p, co, 2, in, most, tissues, of, the, body, the, response, to, hypoxia, is, vasodilation, by, widening, the, blood, vessels, the, tissue, allows, greater, perfusion, by, contrast, in, the, lungs, the, response, to, hypoxia, is, vasoconstriction, this, is, known, as, hypoxic, pulmonary, vasoconstriction, or, hpv, and, has, the, effect, of, redirecting, blood, away, from, poorly, ventilated, regions, which, helps, match, perfusion, to, ventilation, giving, a, more, even, oxygenation, of, blood, from, different, parts, of, the, lungs, in, conditions, of, hypoxic, breathing, gas, such, as, at, high, altitude, hpv, is, generalized, over, the, entire, lung, but, with, sustained, exposure, to, generalized, hypoxia, hpv, is, suppressed, hypoxic, ventilatory, response, hvr, is, the, increase, in, ventilation, induced, by, hypoxia, that, allows, the, body, to, take, in, and, transport, lower, concentrations, of, oxygen, at, higher, rates, it, is, initially, elevated, in, lowlanders, who, travel, to, high, altitude, but, reduces, significantly, over, time, as, people, acclimatize, when, the, pulmonary, capillary, pressure, remains, elevated, chronically, for, at, least, 2, weeks, the, lungs, become, even, more, resistant, to, pulmonary, edema, because, the, lymph, vessels, expand, greatly, increasing, their, capability, of, carrying, fluid, away, from, the, interstitial, spaces, perhaps, as, much, as, 10, fold, therefore, in, patients, with, chronic, mitral, stenosis, pulmonary, capillary, pressures, of, 40, to, 45, mm, hg, have, been, measured, without, the, development, of, lethal, pulmonary, edema, there, are, several, potential, physiologic, mechanisms, for, hypoxemia, but, in, patients, with, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, ventilation, perfusion, v, q, mismatching, is, most, common, with, or, without, alveolar, hypoventilation, as, indicated, by, arterial, carbon, dioxide, concentration, hypoxemia, caused, by, v, q, mismatching, in, copd, is, relatively, easy, to, correct, and, relatively, small, flow, rates, of, supplemental, oxygen, less, than, 3, l, min, for, the, majority, of, patients, are, required, for, long, term, oxygen, therapy, ltot, hypoxemia, normally, stimulates, ventilation, and, produces, dyspnea, but, these, and, the, other, signs, and, symptoms, of, hypoxia, are, sufficiently, variable, in, copd, to, limit, their, value, in, patient, assessment, chronic, alveolar, hypoxia, is, the, main, factor, leading, to, development, of, cor, pulmonale, right, ventricular, hypertrophy, with, or, without, overt, right, ventricular, failure, in, patients, with, copd, pulmonary, hypertension, adversely, affects, survival, in, copd, proportional, to, resting, mean, pulmonary, artery, pressure, elevation, although, the, severity, of, airflow, obstruction, as, measured, by, forced, expiratory, volume, tests, fev1, correlates, best, with, overall, prognosis, in, copd, chronic, hypoxemia, increases, mortality, and, morbidity, for, any, severity, of, disease, large, scale, studies, of, long, term, oxygen, therapy, in, patients, with, copd, show, a, dose, response, relationship, between, daily, hours, of, supplemental, oxygen, use, and, survival, continuous, 24, hours, per, day, oxygen, use, in, appropriately, selected, patients, may, produce, a, significant, survival, benefit, the, brain, has, relatively, high, energy, requirements, using, about, 20, of, the, oxygen, under, resting, conditions, but, low, reserves, which, make, it, specially, vulnerable, to, hypoxia, in, normal, conditions, an, increased, demand, for, oxygen, is, easily, compensated, by, an, increased, cerebral, blood, flow, but, under, conditions, when, there, is, insufficient, oxygen, available, increased, blood, flow, may, not, be, sufficient, to, compensate, and, hypoxia, can, result, in, brain, injury, a, longer, duration, of, cerebral, hypoxia, will, generally, result, in, larger, areas, of, the, brain, being, affected, the, brainstem, hippocampus, and, cerebral, cortex, seem, to, be, the, most, vulnerable, regions, injury, becomes, irreversible, if, oxygenation, is, not, soon, restored, most, cell, death, is, by, necrosis, but, delayed, apoptosis, also, occurs, in, addition, presynaptic, neurons, release, large, amounts, of, glutamate, which, further, increases, ca, 2, influx, and, causes, catastrophic, collapse, in, postsynaptic, cells, although, it, is, the, only, way, to, save, the, tissue, reperfusion, also, produces, reactive, oxygen, species, and, inflammatory, cell, infiltration, which, induces, further, cell, death, if, the, hypoxia, is, not, too, severe, cells, can, suppress, some, of, their, functions, such, as, protein, synthesis, and, spontaneous, electrical, activity, in, a, process, called, penumbra, which, is, reversible, if, the, oxygen, supply, is, resumed, soon, enough, parts, of, the, heart, are, exposed, to, ischemic, hypoxia, in, the, event, of, occlusion, of, a, coronary, artery, short, periods, of, ischaemia, are, reversible, if, reperfused, within, about, 20, minutes, without, development, of, necrosis, but, the, phenomenon, known, as, stunning, is, generally, evident, if, hypoxia, continues, beyond, this, period, necrosis, propagates, through, the, myocardial, tissue, energy, metabolism, in, the, affected, area, shifts, from, mitochondrial, respiration, to, anaerobic, glycolysis, almost, immediately, with, concurrent, reduction, of, effectiveness, of, contractions, which, soon, cease, anaerobic, products, accumulate, in, the, muscle, cells, which, develop, acidosis, and, osmotic, load, leading, to, cellular, edema, intracellular, ca2, increases, and, eventually, leads, to, cell, necrosis, arterial, flow, must, be, restored, to, return, to, aerobic, metabolism, and, prevent, necrosis, of, the, affected, muscle, cells, but, this, also, causes, further, damage, by, reperfusion, injury, myocadial, stunning, has, been, described, as, prolonged, postischaemic, dysfunction, of, viable, tissue, salvaged, by, reperfusion, which, manifests, as, temporary, contractile, failure, in, oxygenated, muscle, tissue, this, may, be, caused, by, a, release, of, reactive, oxygen, species, during, the, early, stages, of, reperfusion, as, tumors, grow, regions, of, relative, hypoxia, develop, as, the, oxygen, supply, is, unevenly, utilized, by, the, tumor, cells, the, formation, of, new, blood, vessels, is, necessary, for, continued, tumor, growth, and, is, also, an, important, factor, in, metastasis, as, the, route, by, which, cancerous, cells, are, transported, to, other, sites, hypoxia, can, present, as, acute, or, chronic, acute, presentation, may, include, dyspnea, shortness, of, breath, and, tachypnea, rapid, often, shallow, breathing, severity, of, symptom, presentation, is, commonly, an, indication, of, severity, of, hypoxia, tachycardia, rapid, pulse, may, develop, to, compensate, for, low, arterial, oxygen, tension, stridor, may, be, heard, in, upper, airway, obstruction, and, cyanosis, may, indicate, severe, hypoxia, neurological, symptoms, and, organ, function, deterioration, occur, when, the, oxygen, delivery, is, severely, compromised, in, moderate, hypoxia, restlessness, headache, and, confusion, may, occur, with, coma, and, eventual, death, possible, in, severe, cases, in, chronic, presentation, dyspnea, following, exertion, is, most, commonly, mentioned, symptoms, of, the, underlying, condition, that, caused, the, hypoxia, may, be, apparent, and, can, help, with, differential, diagnosis, a, productive, cough, and, fever, may, be, present, with, lung, infection, and, leg, edema, may, suggest, heart, failure, lung, auscultation, can, provide, useful, information, an, arterial, blood, gas, test, abg, may, be, done, which, usually, includes, measurements, of, oxygen, content, hemoglobin, oxygen, saturation, how, much, of, the, hemoglobin, is, carrying, oxygen, arterial, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, p, a, o, 2, partial, pressure, of, carbon, dioxide, p, a, co, 2, blood, ph, level, and, bicarbonate, hco, 3, x, rays, or, ct, scans, of, the, chest, and, airways, can, reveal, abnormalities, that, may, affect, ventilation, or, perfusion, a, ventilation, perfusion, scan, also, called, a, v, q, lung, scan, is, a, type, of, medical, imaging, using, scintigraphy, and, medical, isotopes, to, evaluate, the, circulation, of, air, and, blood, within, a, patient, s, lungs, in, order, to, determine, the, ventilation, perfusion, ratio, the, ventilation, part, of, the, test, looks, at, the, ability, of, air, to, reach, all, parts, of, the, lungs, while, the, perfusion, part, evaluates, how, well, blood, circulates, within, the, lungs, pulmonary, function, testing, may, include, treatment, will, depend, on, severity, and, may, also, depend, on, the, cause, as, some, cases, are, due, to, external, causes, and, removing, them, and, treating, acute, symptoms, may, be, sufficient, but, where, the, symptoms, are, due, to, underlying, pathology, treatment, of, the, obvious, symptoms, may, only, provide, temporary, or, partial, relief, so, differential, diagnosis, can, be, important, in, selecting, definitive, treatment, hypoxemic, hypoxia, low, oxygen, tension, in, the, arterial, blood, p, a, o, 2, is, generally, an, indication, of, inability, of, the, lungs, to, properly, oxygenate, the, blood, internal, causes, include, hypoventilation, impaired, alveolar, diffusion, and, pulmonary, shunting, external, causes, include, hypoxic, environment, which, could, be, caused, by, low, ambient, pressure, or, unsuitable, breathing, gas, both, acute, and, chronic, hypoxia, and, hypercapnia, caused, by, respiratory, dysfunction, can, produce, neurological, symptoms, such, as, encephalopathy, seizures, headache, papilledema, and, asterixis, obstructive, sleep, apnea, syndrome, may, cause, morning, headaches, circulatory, hypoxia, caused, by, insufficient, perfusion, of, the, affected, tissues, by, blood, which, is, adequately, oxygenated, this, may, be, generalised, due, to, cardiac, failure, or, hypovolemia, or, localised, due, to, infarction, or, localised, injury, anemic, hypoxia, is, caused, by, a, deficit, in, oxygen, carrying, capacity, usually, due, to, low, hemoglobin, levels, leading, to, generalised, inadequate, oxygen, delivery, histotoxic, hypoxia, dysoxia, is, a, consequence, of, cells, being, unable, to, utilize, oxygen, effectively, a, classic, example, is, cyanide, poisoning, which, inhibits, the, enzyme, cytochrome, c, oxidase, in, the, mitochondria, blocking, the, use, of, oxygen, to, make, atp, critical, illness, polyneuropathy, or, myopathy, should, be, considered, in, the, intensive, care, unit, when, patients, have, difficulty, coming, off, the, ventilator, prevention, can, be, as, simple, as, risk, management, of, occupational, exposure, to, hypoxic, environments, and, commonly, involves, the, use, of, environmental, monitoring, and, personal, protective, equipment, prevention, of, hypoxia, as, a, predictable, consequence, of, medical, conditions, requires, prevention, of, those, conditions, screening, of, demographics, known, to, be, at, risk, for, specific, disorders, may, be, useful, to, counter, the, effects, of, high, altitude, diseases, the, body, must, return, arterial, p, a, o, 2, toward, normal, acclimatization, the, means, by, which, the, body, adapts, to, higher, altitudes, only, partially, restores, p, o, 2, to, standard, levels, hyperventilation, the, body, s, most, common, response, to, high, altitude, conditions, increases, alveolar, p, o, 2, by, raising, the, depth, and, rate, of, breathing, however, while, p, o, 2, does, improve, with, hyperventilation, it, does, not, return, to, normal, studies, of, miners, and, astronomers, working, at, 3000, meters, and, above, show, improved, alveolar, p, o, 2, with, full, acclimatization, yet, the, p, o, 2, level, remains, equal, to, or, even, below, the, threshold, for, continuous, oxygen, therapy, for, patients, with, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, in, addition, there, are, complications, involved, with, acclimatization, polycythemia, in, which, the, body, increases, the, number, of, red, blood, cells, in, circulation, thickens, the, blood, raising, the, risk, of, blood, clots, in, high, altitude, situations, only, oxygen, enrichment, or, compartment, pressurisation, can, counteract, the, effects, of, hypoxia, pressurisation, is, practicable, in, vehicles, and, for, emergencies, in, ground, installations, by, increasing, the, concentration, of, oxygen, in, the, at, ambient, pressure, the, effects, of, lower, barometric, pressure, are, countered, and, the, level, of, arterial, p, o, 2, is, restored, toward, normal, capacity, a, small, amount, of, supplemental, oxygen, reduces, the, equivalent, altitude, in, climate, controlled, rooms, at, 4000, m, raising, the, oxygen, concentration, level, by, 5, via, an, oxygen, concentrator, and, an, existing, ventilation, system, provides, an, altitude, equivalent, of, 3000, m, which, is, much, more, tolerable, for, the, increasing, number, of, low, landers, who, work, in, high, altitude, in, a, study, of, astronomers, working, in, chile, at, 5050, m, oxygen, concentrators, increased, the, level, of, oxygen, concentration, by, almost, 30, percent, that, is, from, 21, percent, to, 27, percent, this, resulted, in, increased, worker, productivity, less, fatigue, and, improved, sleep, oxygen, concentrators, are, suited, for, high, altitude, oxygen, enrichment, of, climate, controlled, environments, they, require, little, maintenance, and, electricity, utilise, a, locally, available, source, of, oxygen, and, eliminate, the, expensive, task, of, transporting, oxygen, cylinders, to, remote, areas, offices, and, housing, often, already, have, climate, controlled, rooms, in, which, temperature, and, humidity, are, kept, at, a, constant, level, treatment, and, management, depend, on, circumstances, for, most, high, altitude, situations, the, risk, is, known, and, prevention, is, appropriate, at, low, altitudes, hypoxia, is, more, likely, to, be, associated, with, a, medical, problem, or, an, unexpected, contingency, and, treatment, is, more, likely, to, be, provided, to, suit, the, specific, case, it, is, necessary, to, identify, persons, who, need, oxygen, therapy, as, supplemental, oxygen, is, required, to, treat, most, causes, of, hypoxia, but, different, oxygen, concentrations, may, be, appropriate, treatment, will, depend, on, the, cause, of, hypoxia, if, it, is, determined, that, there, is, an, external, cause, and, it, can, be, removed, then, treatment, may, be, limited, to, support, and, returning, the, system, to, normal, oxygenation, in, other, cases, a, longer, course, of, treatment, may, be, necessary, and, this, may, require, supplemental, oxygen, over, a, fairly, long, term, or, indefinitely, there, are, three, main, aspects, of, oxygenation, treatment, maintaining, patent, airways, providing, sufficient, oxygen, content, of, the, inspired, air, and, improving, the, diffusion, in, the, lungs, in, some, cases, treatment, may, extend, to, improving, oxygen, capacity, of, the, blood, which, may, include, volumetric, and, circulatory, intervention, and, support, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, and, treatment, of, intoxication, invasive, ventilation, may, be, necessary, or, an, elective, option, in, surgery, this, generally, involves, a, positive, pressure, ventilator, connected, to, an, endotracheal, tube, and, allows, precise, delivery, of, ventilation, accurate, monitoring, of, f, i, o, 2, and, positive, end, expiratory, pressure, and, can, be, combined, with, anaesthetic, gas, delivery, in, some, cases, a, tracheotomy, may, be, necessary, decreasing, metabolic, rate, by, reducing, body, temperature, lowers, oxygen, demand, and, consumption, and, can, minimise, the, effects, of, tissue, hypoxia, especially, in, the, brain, and, therapeutic, hypothermia, based, on, this, principle, may, be, useful, where, the, problem, is, due, to, respiratory, failure, it, is, desirable, to, treat, the, underlying, cause, in, cases, of, pulmonary, edema, diuretics, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, oedems, steroids, may, be, effective, in, some, cases, of, interstitial, lung, disease, and, in, extreme, cases, extracorporeal, membrane, oxygenation, ecmo, can, be, used, hyperbaric, oxygen, has, been, found, useful, for, treating, some, forms, of, localized, hypoxia, including, poorly, perfused, trauma, injuries, such, as, crush, injury, compartment, syndrome, and, other, acute, traumatic, ischemias, it, is, the, definitive, treatment, for, severe, decompression, sickness, which, is, largely, a, condition, involving, localized, hypoxia, initially, caused, by, inert, gas, embolism, and, inflammatory, reactions, to, extravascular, bubble, growth, it, is, also, effective, in, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, and, diabetic, foot, a, prescription, renewal, for, home, oxygen, following, hospitalization, requires, an, assessment, of, the, patient, for, ongoing, hypoxemia, prognosis, is, strongly, affected, by, cause, severity, treatment, and, underlying, pathology, hypoxia, leading, to, reduced, capacity, to, respond, appropriately, or, to, loss, of, consciousness, has, been, implicated, in, incidents, where, the, direct, cause, of, death, was, not, hypoxia, this, is, recorded, in, underwater, diving, incidents, where, drowning, has, often, been, given, as, cause, of, death, high, altitude, mountaineering, where, exposure, hypothermia, and, falls, have, been, consequences, flying, in, unpressurized, aircraft, and, aerobatic, maneuvers, where, loss, of, control, leading, to, a, crash, is, possible, hypoxia, is, a, common, disorder, but, there, are, many, possible, causes, prevalence, is, variable, some, of, the, causes, are, very, common, like, pneumonia, or, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, some, are, quite, rare, like, hypoxia, due, to, cyanide, poisoning, others, like, reduced, oxygen, tension, at, high, altitude, may, be, regionally, distributed, or, associated, with, a, specific, demographic, generalized, hypoxia, is, an, occupational, hazard, in, several, high, risk, occupations, including, firefighting, professional, diving, mining, and, underground, rescue, and, flying, at, high, altitudes, in, unpressurised, aircraft, potentially, life, threatening, hypoxemia, is, common, in, critically, ill, patients, localized, hypoxia, may, be, a, complication, of, diabetes, decompression, sickness, and, of, trauma, that, affects, blood, supply, to, the, extremities, hypoxia, due, to, underdeveloped, lung, function, is, a, common, complication, of, premature, birth, in, the, united, states, intrauterine, hypoxia, and, birth, asphyxia, were, listed, together, as, the, tenth, leading, cause, of, neonatal, death, silent, hypoxia, also, known, as, happy, hypoxia, is, generalised, hypoxia, that, does, not, coincide, with, shortness, of, breath, this, presentation, is, known, to, be, a, complication, of, covid, 19, and, is, also, known, in, atypical, pneumonia, altitude, sickness, and, rebreather, malfunction, accidents, the, 2019, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, was, awarded, to, william, g, kaelin, jr, sir, peter, j, ratcliffe, and, gregg, l, semenza, in, recognition, of, their, discovery, of, cellular, mechanisms, to, sense, and, adapt, to, different, oxygen, concentrations, establishing, a, basis, for, how, oxygen, levels, affect, physiological, function, the, use, of, the, term, hypoxia, appears, to, be, relatively, recent, with, the, first, recorded, use, in, scientific, publication, from, 1945, previous, to, this, the, term, anoxia, was, extensively, used, for, all, levels, of, oxygen, deprivation, investigation, into, the, effects, of, lack, of, oxygen, date, from, the, mid, 19th, century, hypoxia, is, formed, from, the, greek, roots, o, hypo, meaning, under, below, and, less, than, and, o, oxy, meaning, acute, or, acid, which, is, the, root, for, oxygen
