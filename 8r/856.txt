euoticus, galago, galagoides, otolemur, paragalago, sciurocheirus, galagos, l, e, o, z, also, known, as, bush, babies, or, nagapies, meaning, night, monkeys, in, afrikaans, are, small, nocturnal, primates, native, to, continental, sub, sahara, africa, and, make, up, the, family, galagidae, also, sometimes, called, galagonidae, they, are, considered, a, sister, group, of, the, lorisidae, according, to, some, accounts, the, name, bush, baby, comes, from, either, the, animal, s, cries, or, its, appearance, the, ghanaian, name, aposor, is, given, to, them, because, of, their, firm, grip, on, branches, in, both, variety, and, abundance, the, bush, babies, are, the, most, successful, strepsirrhine, primates, in, africa, according, to, the, african, wildlife, foundation, galagos, are, currently, grouped, into, six, genera, euoticus, is, a, basal, sister, taxon, to, all, the, other, galagids, the, dwarf, galagids, recently, grouped, under, the, genus, galagoides, have, been, found, based, on, genetic, data, and, supported, by, analysis, of, vocalisations, and, morphology, to, actually, consist, of, two, clades, which, are, not, sister, taxa, in, eastern, and, western, central, africa, separated, by, the, rift, valley, the, latter, are, basal, to, all, the, other, non, euoticus, galagids, the, former, group, is, sister, to, galago, and, has, been, elevated, to, full, genus, status, as, paragalago, the, genera, otolemur, and, sciurocheirus, are, also, sisters, family, galagidae, galagos, or, bushbabies, the, phylogeny, of, galagidae, according, to, masters, et, al, 2017, is, as, follows, euoticus, galagoides, galago, paragalago, otolemur, sciurocheirus, galagos, have, large, eyes, that, give, them, good, night, vision, in, addition, to, other, characteristics, like, strong, hind, limbs, acute, hearing, and, long, tails, that, help, them, balance, their, ears, are, bat, like, and, allow, them, to, track, insects, in, the, dark, they, catch, insects, on, the, ground, or, snatch, them, out, of, the, air, they, are, fast, agile, creatures, as, they, bound, through, the, thick, bushes, they, fold, their, delicate, ears, back, to, protect, them, they, also, fold, them, during, rest, they, have, nails, on, most, of, their, digits, except, for, the, second, toe, of, the, hind, foot, which, bears, a, grooming, claw, their, diet, is, a, mixture, of, insects, and, other, small, animals, fruit, and, tree, gums, they, have, pectinate, comb, like, incisors, called, toothcombs, and, the, dental, formula, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, they, are, active, at, night, after, a, gestation, period, of, 110, 133, days, young, galagos, are, born, with, half, closed, eyes, and, are, initially, unable, to, move, about, independently, after, a, few, 6, 8, days, the, mother, carries, the, infant, in, her, mouth, and, places, it, on, branches, while, feeding, females, may, have, singles, twins, or, triplets, and, may, become, very, aggressive, each, newborn, weighs, less, than, one, half, ounce, 14, g, for, the, first, three, days, the, infant, is, kept, in, constant, contact, with, the, mother, the, young, are, fed, by, the, mother, for, six, weeks, and, can, feed, themselves, at, two, months, the, young, grow, rapidly, often, causing, the, mother, to, walk, awkwardly, as, she, transports, them, females, maintain, a, territory, shared, with, their, offspring, while, males, leave, their, mothers, territories, after, puberty, thus, social, groups, consist, of, closely, related, females, and, their, young, adult, males, maintain, separate, territories, which, overlap, with, those, of, the, female, social, groups, generally, one, adult, male, mates, with, all, the, females, in, an, area, males, that, have, not, established, such, territories, sometimes, form, small, bachelor, groups, bush, babies, are, sometimes, kept, as, pets, although, this, is, not, advised, because, like, many, other, nonhuman, primates, they, are, a, likely, sources, of, diseases, that, can, cross, species, barriers, equally, they, are, very, likely, to, attract, attention, from, customs, officials, on, importation, into, many, countries, reports, from, veterinary, and, zoological, sources, indicate, captive, lifetimes, of, 12, 0, to, 16, 5, years, suggesting, a, natural, lifetime, over, a, decade, galagos, communicate, by, calling, to, each, other, and, by, marking, their, paths, with, urine, by, following, the, scent, of, urine, they, can, land, on, exactly, the, same, branch, every, time, each, species, produces, a, unique, set, of, loud, calls, that, have, different, functions, one, function, is, to, identify, individuals, as, members, of, a, particular, species, across, distances, scientists, can, recognize, all, known, galago, species, by, their, loud, calls, at, the, end, of, the, night, group, members, use, a, special, rallying, call, and, gather, to, sleep, in, a, nest, of, leaves, a, group, of, branches, or, a, hole, in, a, tree, galagos, have, remarkable, jumping, abilities, the, highest, reliably, reported, jump, for, a, galago, is, 2, 25, m, 7, ft, 5, in, according, to, a, study, published, by, the, royal, society, given, the, body, mass, of, each, animal, and, the, fact, that, the, leg, muscles, amount, to, about, 25, of, this, galago, s, jumping, muscles, should, perform, six, to, nine, times, better, than, those, of, a, frog, this, is, thought, to, be, due, to, elastic, energy, storage, in, tendons, of, the, lower, leg, allowing, far, greater, jumps, than, would, otherwise, be, possible, for, an, animal, of, their, size, in, mid, flight, they, tuck, their, arms, and, legs, close, to, the, body, they, bring, them, out, at, the, last, second, to, grab, a, branch, in, a, series, of, leaps, a, galago, can, cover, ten, yards, in, mere, seconds, the, tail, which, is, longer, than, the, length, of, the, head, and, body, combined, assists, the, legs, in, powering, the, jumps, they, may, also, hop, like, a, kangaroo, or, simply, run, or, walk, on, four, legs, such, strong, complicated, and, coordinated, movements, are, due, to, the, rostral, half, of, the, posterior, parietal, cortex, that, is, linked, to, the, motor, premotor, and, visuomotor, areas, of, the, frontal, cortex, generally, the, social, structure, of, the, galago, has, components, of, both, social, life, and, solitary, life, this, can, be, seen, in, their, play, they, swing, off, branches, or, climb, high, and, throw, things, social, play, includes, play, fights, play, grooming, and, following, play, during, following, play, two, galagos, jump, sporadically, and, chase, each, other, through, the, trees, the, older, galagos, in, a, group, prefer, to, rest, alone, while, younger, ones, are, in, constant, contact, with, one, another, this, is, observed, in, the, galago, garnetti, species, mothers, often, leave, infants, alone, for, long, periods, and, do, not, try, to, stop, them, from, leaving, on, the, other, hand, the, offspring, tries, to, stay, close, to, and, initiate, social, interactions, with, the, mother, grooming, is, a, very, important, part, of, galago, daily, life, they, often, groom, themselves, before, during, and, after, rest, social, grooming, is, done, more, often, by, males, in, the, group, females, often, reject, attempts, by, males, to, groom, them, the, bush, baby, also, refers, to, a, myth, that, is, used, to, scare, children, to, stay, indoors, at, night, most, likely, arising, from, the, baby, like, cry, the, unusual, nature, evolved, into, a, myth, about, a, powerful, animal, that, can, kidnap, humans, it, is, also, said, that, wild, bush, babies, galagos, in, nigeria, can, never, be, found, dead, on, plain, ground, rather, they, make, a, nest, of, sticks, leaves, or, branches, to, die, in, endangerment, of, the, species, in, sub, saharan, africa, has, made, this, claim, difficult, to, verify
