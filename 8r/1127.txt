yam, is, the, common, name, for, some, plant, species, in, the, genus, dioscorea, family, dioscoreaceae, that, form, edible, tubers, some, other, species, in, the, genus, being, toxic, yams, are, perennial, herbaceous, vines, native, to, africa, asia, and, the, americas, and, cultivated, for, the, consumption, of, their, starchy, tubers, in, many, temperate, and, tropical, regions, the, tubers, themselves, also, called, yams, come, in, a, variety, of, forms, owing, to, numerous, cultivars, and, related, species, a, monocot, related, to, lilies, and, grasses, yams, are, vigorous, herbaceous, perennially, growing, vines, from, a, tuber, some, 870, species, of, yams, are, known, a, few, of, which, are, widely, grown, for, their, edible, tuber, but, others, of, which, are, toxic, such, as, d, communis, yam, plants, can, grow, up, to, 15, metres, 49, feet, in, length, and, 7, 6, to, 15, 2, centimetres, 3, to, 6, inches, high, the, tuber, may, grow, into, the, soil, up, to, 1, 5, m, 5, ft, deep, the, plant, disperses, by, seed, the, edible, tuber, has, a, rough, skin, that, is, difficult, to, peel, but, readily, softened, by, cooking, the, skins, vary, in, color, from, dark, brown, to, light, pink, the, majority, or, meat, of, the, vegetable, is, composed, of, a, much, softer, substance, ranging, in, color, from, white, or, yellow, to, purple, or, pink, in, mature, yams, the, name, yam, appears, to, derive, from, portuguese, inhame, or, canarian, spanish, ame, which, derived, from, fula, one, of, the, west, african, languages, during, trade, however, in, portuguese, this, name, commonly, refers, to, the, taro, plant, colocasia, esculenta, from, the, genus, colocasia, as, opposed, to, dioscorea, the, main, derivations, borrow, from, verbs, meaning, to, eat, true, yams, have, various, common, names, across, multiple, world, regions, in, some, places, other, unrelated, root, vegetables, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, yams, including, yams, are, native, to, africa, asia, and, the, americas, three, species, were, independently, domesticated, on, those, continents, d, rotundata, africa, d, alata, asia, and, d, trifida, south, america, some, yams, are, invasive, plants, often, considered, a, noxious, weed, outside, cultivated, areas, yams, are, cultivated, for, the, consumption, of, their, starchy, tubers, in, many, temperate, and, tropical, regions, especially, in, west, africa, south, america, and, the, caribbean, asia, and, oceania, about, 95, of, yam, crops, are, grown, in, africa, a, yam, crop, begins, when, whole, seed, tubers, or, tuber, portions, are, planted, into, mounds, or, ridges, at, the, beginning, of, the, rainy, season, the, crop, yield, depends, on, how, and, where, the, sets, are, planted, sizes, of, mounds, interplant, spacing, provision, of, stakes, for, the, resultant, plants, yam, species, and, tuber, sizes, desired, at, harvest, small, scale, farmers, in, west, and, central, africa, often, intercrop, yams, with, cereals, and, vegetables, the, seed, yams, are, perishable, and, bulky, to, transport, farmers, who, do, not, buy, new, seed, yams, usually, set, aside, up, to, 30, of, their, harvest, for, planting, the, next, year, yam, crops, face, pressure, from, a, range, of, insect, pests, and, fungal, and, viral, diseases, as, well, as, nematodes, their, growth, and, dormant, phases, correspond, respectively, to, the, wet, season, and, the, dry, season, for, maximum, yield, the, yams, require, a, humid, tropical, environment, with, an, annual, rainfall, over, 1, 500, millimetres, 59, in, distributed, uniformly, throughout, the, growing, season, white, yellow, and, water, yams, typically, produce, a, single, large, tuber, per, year, generally, weighing, 5, to, 10, kilograms, 11, to, 22, pounds, yams, suffer, from, relatively, few, pests, and, diseases, there, is, an, anthracnose, caused, by, colletotrichum, gloeosporioides, which, is, widely, distributed, around, the, world, s, growing, regions, winch, et, al, 1984, finds, c, gloeosporioides, afflicts, a, large, number, of, dioscorea, spp, despite, the, high, labor, requirements, and, production, costs, consumer, demand, for, yam, is, high, in, certain, subregions, of, africa, making, yam, cultivation, quite, profitable, to, certain, farmers, many, cultivated, species, of, dioscorea, yams, are, found, throughout, the, humid, tropics, the, most, economically, important, are, discussed, below, non, dioscorea, tubers, that, were, historically, important, in, africa, include, plectranthus, rotundifolius, the, hausa, potato, and, p, esculentus, the, livingstone, potato, these, two, tuber, crops, have, now, been, largely, displaced, by, the, introduction, of, cassava, d, rotundata, the, white, yam, and, d, cayenensis, the, yellow, yam, are, native, to, africa, they, are, the, most, important, cultivated, yams, in, the, past, they, were, considered, as, two, separate, species, but, most, taxonomists, now, regard, them, as, the, same, species, over, 200, varieties, between, them, are, cultivated, white, yam, tuber, is, roughly, cylindrical, in, shape, the, skin, is, smooth, and, brown, and, the, flesh, is, usually, white, and, firm, yellow, yam, has, yellow, flesh, caused, by, the, presence, of, carotenoids, it, looks, similar, to, the, white, yam, in, outer, appearance, its, tuber, skin, is, usually, a, bit, firmer, and, less, extensively, grooved, the, yellow, yam, has, a, longer, period, of, vegetation, and, a, shorter, dormancy, than, white, yam, the, kokoro, variety, is, important, in, making, dried, yam, chips, they, are, large, plants, the, vines, can, be, as, long, as, 10, to, 12, m, 33, to, 39, ft, the, tubers, most, often, weigh, about, 2, 5, to, 5, kg, 6, to, 11, lb, each, but, can, weigh, as, much, as, 25, kg, 55, lb, after, 7, to, 12, months, growth, the, tubers, are, harvested, in, africa, most, are, pounded, into, a, paste, to, make, the, traditional, dish, of, pounded, yam, known, as, iyan, d, alata, called, purple, yam, not, to, be, confused, with, the, okinawan, purple, yam, which, is, a, sweet, potato, greater, yam, winged, yam, water, yam, and, ambiguously, white, yam, was, first, cultivated, in, southeast, asia, although, not, grown, in, the, same, quantities, as, the, african, yams, it, has, the, largest, distribution, worldwide, of, any, cultivated, yam, being, grown, in, asia, the, pacific, islands, africa, and, the, west, indies, even, in, africa, the, popularity, of, water, yam, is, second, only, to, white, yam, the, tuber, shape, is, generally, cylindrical, but, can, vary, tuber, flesh, is, white, and, watery, in, texture, d, alata, and, d, esculenta, lesser, yam, were, important, staple, crops, to, the, seafaring, austronesian, cultures, they, were, carried, along, with, the, austronesian, migrations, as, canoe, plants, from, island, southeast, asia, to, as, far, as, madagascar, and, polynesia, d, polystachya, chinese, yam, is, native, to, china, the, chinese, yam, plant, is, somewhat, smaller, than, the, african, with, the, vines, about, 3, m, 10, ft, long, it, is, tolerant, to, frost, and, can, be, grown, in, much, cooler, conditions, than, other, yams, it, is, also, grown, in, korea, and, japan, it, was, introduced, to, europe, in, the, 19th, century, when, the, potato, crop, there, was, falling, victim, to, disease, and, is, still, grown, in, france, for, the, asian, food, market, the, tubers, are, harvested, after, about, 6, months, of, growth, some, are, eaten, right, after, harvesting, and, some, are, used, as, ingredients, for, other, dishes, including, noodles, and, for, traditional, medicines, d, bulbifera, the, air, potato, is, found, in, both, africa, and, asia, with, slight, differences, between, those, found, in, each, place, it, is, a, large, vine, 6, m, 20, ft, or, more, in, length, it, produces, tubers, but, the, bulbils, which, grow, at, the, base, of, its, leaves, are, the, more, important, food, product, they, are, about, the, size, of, potatoes, hence, the, name, air, potato, weighing, from, 0, 5, to, 2, 0, kg, 1, lb, 2, oz, to, 4, lb, 7, oz, some, varieties, can, be, eaten, raw, while, some, require, soaking, or, boiling, for, detoxification, before, eating, it, is, not, grown, much, commercially, since, the, flavor, of, other, yams, is, preferred, by, most, people, however, it, is, popular, in, home, vegetable, gardens, because, it, produces, a, crop, after, only, four, months, of, growth, and, continues, producing, for, the, life, of, the, vine, as, long, as, two, years, also, the, bulbils, are, easy, to, harvest, and, cook, in, 1905, the, air, potato, was, introduced, to, florida, and, has, since, become, an, invasive, species, in, much, of, the, state, its, rapid, growth, crowds, out, native, vegetation, and, it, is, very, difficult, to, remove, since, it, can, grow, back, from, the, tubers, and, new, vines, can, grow, from, the, bulbils, even, after, being, cut, down, or, burned, d, esculenta, the, lesser, yam, was, one, of, the, first, yam, species, cultivated, it, is, native, to, southeast, asia, and, is, the, third, most, commonly, cultivated, species, there, although, it, is, cultivated, very, little, in, other, parts, of, the, world, its, vines, seldom, reach, more, than, 3, m, 10, ft, in, length, and, the, tubers, are, fairly, small, in, most, varieties, the, tubers, are, eaten, baked, boiled, or, fried, much, like, potatoes, because, of, the, small, size, of, the, tubers, mechanical, cultivation, is, possible, which, along, with, its, easy, preparation, and, good, flavor, could, help, the, lesser, yam, to, become, more, popular, in, the, future, d, dumetorum, the, bitter, yam, is, popular, as, a, vegetable, in, parts, of, west, africa, in, part, because, their, cultivation, requires, less, labor, than, other, yams, the, wild, forms, are, very, toxic, and, are, sometimes, used, to, poison, animals, when, mixed, with, bait, it, is, said, that, they, have, also, been, used, for, criminal, purposes, d, trifida, the, cush, cush, yam, is, native, to, the, guyana, region, of, south, america, and, is, the, most, important, cultivated, new, world, yam, since, they, originated, in, tropical, rainforest, conditions, their, growth, cycle, is, less, related, to, seasonal, changes, than, other, yams, because, of, their, relative, ease, of, cultivation, and, their, good, flavor, they, are, considered, to, have, a, great, potential, for, increased, production, d, hirtiflora, subsp, pedicellata, lusala, busala, or, lwidi, is, native, to, tropical, africa, it, is, widely, harvested, and, eaten, in, southern, zambia, where, it, grows, in, open, forest, areas, in, southern, zambia, it, is, an, important, addition, to, the, march, september, diets, of, almost, all, and, income, of, over, half, of, rural, households, research, on, propagation, of, this, subspecies, to, alleviate, the, threat, from, wild, harvest, has, been, successful, d, japonica, known, as, east, asian, mountain, yam, yamaimo, or, japanese, mountain, yam, is, a, type, of, yam, dioscorea, native, to, japan, including, ryukyu, and, bonin, islands, korea, china, taiwan, and, assam, d, japonica, is, used, for, food, jinenjo, also, called, the, wild, yam, is, a, related, variety, of, japanese, yam, that, is, used, as, an, ingredient, in, soba, noodles, yams, in, west, africa, are, typically, harvested, by, hand, using, sticks, spades, or, diggers, wood, based, tools, are, preferred, to, metallic, tools, as, they, are, less, likely, to, damage, the, fragile, tubers, however, wood, tools, need, frequent, replacement, yam, harvesting, is, labor, intensive, and, physically, demanding, tuber, harvesting, involves, standing, bending, squatting, and, sometimes, sitting, on, the, ground, depending, on, the, size, of, mound, size, of, tuber, or, depth, of, tuber, penetration, care, must, be, taken, to, avoid, damage, to, the, tuber, because, damaged, tubers, do, not, store, well, and, spoil, rapidly, some, farmers, use, staking, and, mixed, cropping, a, practice, that, complicates, harvesting, in, some, cases, in, forested, areas, tubers, grow, in, areas, where, other, tree, roots, are, present, harvesting, the, tuber, then, involves, the, additional, step, of, freeing, them, from, other, roots, this, often, causes, tuber, damage, aerial, tubers, or, bulbils, are, harvested, by, manual, plucking, from, the, vine, yields, may, improve, and, cost, of, yam, production, be, lower, if, mechanization, were, to, be, developed, and, adopted, however, current, crop, production, practices, and, species, used, pose, considerable, hurdles, to, successful, mechanization, of, yam, production, particularly, for, small, scale, rural, farmers, extensive, changes, in, traditional, cultivation, practices, such, as, mixed, cropping, may, be, required, modification, of, current, tuber, harvesting, equipment, is, necessary, given, yam, tuber, architecture, and, its, different, physical, properties, in, 2020, world, production, of, yams, was, 75, million, metric, tons, 74, 000, 000, long, tons, 83, 000, 000, short, tons, led, by, nigeria, with, 67, of, the, total, table, unlike, cassava, most, varieties, of, edible, mature, cultivated, yam, do, not, contain, toxic, compounds, however, there, are, exceptions, bitter, compounds, tend, to, accumulate, in, immature, tuber, tissues, of, white, and, yellow, yams, these, may, be, polyphenols, or, tannin, like, compounds, wild, forms, of, bitter, yams, d, dumetorum, do, contain, some, toxins, such, as, dihydrodioscorine, that, taste, bitter, hence, are, referred, to, as, bitter, yam, bitter, yams, are, not, normally, eaten, except, at, times, of, desperation, in, poor, countries, and, in, times, of, local, food, scarcity, they, are, usually, detoxified, by, soaking, in, a, vessel, of, salt, water, in, cold, or, hot, fresh, water, or, in, a, stream, the, bitter, compounds, in, these, yams, are, water, soluble, alkaloids, which, on, ingestion, produce, severe, and, distressing, symptoms, severe, cases, of, alkaloid, intoxication, may, prove, fatal, aerial, or, potato, yams, d, bulbifera, have, antinutritional, factors, in, asia, detoxification, methods, involving, water, extraction, fermentation, and, roasting, of, the, grated, tuber, are, used, for, bitter, cultivars, of, this, yam, the, bitter, compounds, in, yams, also, known, locally, as, air, potato, include, diosbulbin, and, possibly, saponins, such, as, diosgenin, in, indonesia, an, extract, of, air, potato, is, used, in, the, preparation, of, arrow, poison, raw, yam, has, only, moderate, nutrient, density, with, appreciable, content, 10, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, limited, to, potassium, vitamin, b6, manganese, thiamin, dietary, fiber, and, vitamin, c, table, but, raw, yam, has, the, highest, potassium, levels, amongst, the, 10, major, staple, foods, of, the, world, see, nutritional, chart, yam, supplies, 118, calories, per, 100, grams, yam, generally, has, a, lower, glycemic, index, about, 54, of, glucose, per, 150, gram, serving, compared, to, potato, products, the, protein, content, and, quality, of, roots, and, tubers, is, lower, than, other, food, staples, with, the, content, of, yam, and, potato, being, around, 2, on, a, fresh, weight, basis, yams, with, cassava, provide, a, much, greater, proportion, of, the, protein, intake, in, africa, ranging, from, 5, 9, in, east, and, south, africa, to, about, 15, 9, in, humid, west, africa, as, a, relatively, low, protein, food, yam, is, not, a, good, source, of, essential, amino, acids, experts, emphasize, the, need, to, supplement, a, yam, dominant, diet, with, more, protein, rich, foods, to, support, healthy, growth, in, children, yam, is, an, important, dietary, element, for, nigerian, and, west, african, people, it, contributes, more, than, 200, calories, per, person, per, day, for, more, than, 150, million, people, in, west, africa, and, is, an, important, source, of, income, yam, is, an, attractive, crop, in, poor, farms, with, limited, resources, it, is, rich, in, starch, and, can, be, prepared, in, many, ways, it, is, available, all, year, round, unlike, other, unreliable, seasonal, crops, these, characteristics, make, yam, a, preferred, food, and, a, culturally, important, food, security, crop, in, some, sub, saharan, african, countries, the, following, table, shows, the, nutrient, content, of, yam, and, major, staple, foods, in, a, raw, harvested, form, on, a, dry, weight, basis, to, account, for, their, different, water, contents, raw, forms, however, are, not, edible, and, cannot, be, digested, these, must, be, sprouted, or, prepared, and, cooked, for, human, consumption, in, sprouted, or, cooked, form, the, relative, nutritional, and, antinutritional, contents, of, each, of, these, staples, is, remarkably, different, from, that, of, raw, form, of, these, staples, a, raw, yellow, dent, corn, b, raw, unenriched, long, grain, white, rice, c, raw, hard, red, winter, wheat, d, raw, potato, with, flesh, and, skin, e, raw, cassava, f, raw, green, soybeans, g, raw, sweet, potato, h, raw, sorghum, y, raw, yam, z, raw, plantains, unofficial, roots, and, tubers, such, as, yam, are, living, organisms, when, stored, they, continue, to, respire, which, results, in, the, oxidation, of, the, starch, a, polymer, of, glucose, contained, in, the, cells, of, the, tuber, which, converts, it, into, water, carbon, dioxide, and, heat, energy, during, this, transformation, of, the, starch, the, dry, matter, of, the, tuber, is, reduced, amongst, the, major, roots, and, tubers, properly, stored, yam, is, considered, to, be, the, least, perishable, successful, storage, of, yams, requires, storing, yam, at, low, temperature, reduces, the, respiration, rates, however, temperatures, below, 12, c, 54, f, cause, damage, through, chilling, causing, a, breakdown, of, internal, tissues, increasing, water, loss, and, yam, s, susceptibility, to, decay, the, symptoms, of, chilling, injury, are, not, always, obvious, when, the, tubers, are, still, in, cold, storage, the, injury, becomes, noticeable, as, soon, as, the, tubers, are, restored, to, ambient, temperatures, the, best, temperature, to, store, yams, is, between, 14, and, 16, c, 57, and, 61, f, with, high, technology, controlled, humidity, and, climatic, conditions, after, a, process, of, curing, most, countries, that, grow, yams, as, a, staple, food, are, too, poor, to, afford, high, technology, storage, systems, sprouting, rapidly, increases, a, tuber, s, respiration, rates, and, accelerates, the, rate, at, which, its, food, value, decreases, certain, cultivars, of, yams, store, better, than, others, the, easier, to, store, yams, are, those, adapted, to, arid, climate, where, they, tend, to, stay, in, a, dormant, low, respiration, stage, much, longer, than, yam, breeds, adapted, to, humid, tropical, lands, where, they, do, not, need, dormancy, yellow, yam, and, cush, cush, yam, by, nature, have, much, shorter, dormancy, periods, than, water, yam, white, yam, or, lesser, yam, storage, losses, for, yams, are, very, high, in, africa, with, bacteria, insects, nematodes, and, mammals, being, the, most, common, storage, pests, 12, 7, yams, are, consumed, in, a, variety, of, preparations, such, as, flour, or, whole, vegetable, pieces, across, their, range, of, distribution, in, asia, africa, north, america, central, america, the, caribbean, south, america, and, oceania, yams, of, african, species, must, be, cooked, to, be, safely, eaten, because, various, natural, substances, in, yams, can, cause, illness, if, consumed, raw, the, most, common, cooking, methods, in, western, and, central, africa, are, by, boiling, frying, or, roasting, among, the, akan, of, ghana, boiled, yam, can, be, mashed, with, palm, oil, into, eto, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, plantain, dish, matoke, and, is, served, with, eggs, the, boiled, yam, can, also, be, pounded, with, a, traditional, mortar, and, pestle, to, create, a, thick, starchy, paste, known, as, iyan, pounded, yam, which, is, eaten, with, traditional, sauces, such, as, egusi, and, palm, nut, soup, another, method, of, consumption, is, to, leave, the, raw, yam, pieces, to, dry, in, the, sun, when, dry, the, pieces, turn, a, dark, brown, color, these, are, then, milled, to, create, a, brown, powder, known, in, nigeria, as, elubo, the, powder, can, be, mixed, with, boiling, water, to, create, a, thick, starchy, paste, a, kind, of, pudding, known, as, amala, which, is, then, eaten, with, local, soups, and, sauces, yams, are, a, staple, agricultural, commodity, in, west, africa, with, cultural, significance, where, over, 95, of, the, world, s, yam, crop, is, harvested, yams, are, still, important, for, survival, in, these, regions, some, varieties, of, these, tubers, can, be, stored, up, to, six, months, without, refrigeration, which, makes, them, a, valuable, resource, for, the, yearly, period, of, food, scarcity, at, the, beginning, of, the, wet, season, yam, cultivars, are, also, cultivated, in, other, humid, tropical, countries, yam, is, the, main, staple, crop, of, the, igbos, in, south, eastern, nigeria, where, for, centuries, it, played, a, dominant, role, in, both, their, agricultural, and, cultural, life, it, is, celebrated, with, annual, yam, festivals, yams, are, particularly, consumed, in, the, coastal, area, of, the, northeast, region, although, they, can, be, found, in, other, parts, of, the, country, in, pernambuco, state, it, is, usually, boiled, and, served, cut, in, slices, at, breakfast, along, with, cheese, spread, or, molasses, in, colombia, yam, production, has, been, specifically, located, in, the, caribbean, region, where, it, has, become, a, key, product, in, the, diet, of, the, population, of, this, area, in, 2010, colombia, was, among, the, 12, countries, with, the, highest, yam, production, worldwide, and, ranked, first, in, yield, of, tons, per, hectare, planted, although, its, main, use, is, for, food, several, studies, have, shown, its, usefulness, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, and, the, manufacture, of, bioplastics, however, in, colombia, there, is, no, evidence, of, the, use, of, this, product, other, than, food, in, the, philippines, the, purple, ube, species, of, yam, d, alata, is, eaten, as, a, sweetened, dessert, called, ube, halaya, and, is, also, used, as, an, ingredient, in, another, filipino, dessert, halo, halo, it, is, also, used, as, a, popular, ingredient, for, ice, cream, in, vietnam, yams, are, used, to, prepare, dishes, such, as, canh, khoai, m, or, canh, khoai, t, this, involves, mashing, the, yam, and, cooking, it, until, very, well, done, the, yam, root, was, traditionally, used, by, peasants, in, vietnam, to, dye, cotton, clothes, throughout, the, red, river, and, mekong, delta, regions, as, late, as, the, mid, 20th, century, and, is, still, used, by, others, in, the, sapa, region, of, northern, vietnam, in, indonesia, the, same, purple, yam, is, used, for, preparing, desserts, this, involves, mashing, the, yam, and, mixing, it, with, coconut, milk, and, sugar, white, and, off, white, fleshed, yams, are, cut, in, cubes, cooked, lightly, fermented, and, eaten, as, afternoon, snacks, an, exception, to, the, cooking, rule, is, the, mountain, yam, dioscorea, polystachya, known, as, nagaimo, and, can, be, further, classified, into, ich, imo, lit, ginkgo, leaf, yam, kanji, or, yamatoimo, lit, yamato, yam, kanji, depending, on, the, root, shape, mountain, yam, is, eaten, raw, and, grated, after, only, a, relatively, minimal, preparation, the, whole, tubers, are, briefly, soaked, in, a, vinegar, water, solution, to, neutralize, irritant, oxalate, crystals, found, in, their, skin, the, raw, vegetable, is, starchy, and, bland, mucilaginous, when, grated, and, may, be, eaten, plain, as, a, side, dish, or, added, to, noodles, another, variety, of, yam, jinenjo, is, used, in, japan, as, an, ingredient, in, soba, noodles, in, okinawa, purple, yams, dioscorea, alata, are, grown, this, purple, yam, is, popular, as, lightly, deep, fried, tempura, as, well, as, being, grilled, or, boiled, additionally, the, purple, yam, is, a, common, ingredient, of, yam, ice, cream, with, the, signature, purple, color, purple, yam, is, also, used, in, other, types, of, traditional, wagashi, sweets, cakes, and, candy, in, central, parts, of, india, the, yam, is, prepared, by, being, finely, sliced, seasoned, with, spices, and, deep, fried, in, southern, india, the, vegetable, is, a, popular, accompaniment, to, rice, dishes, and, curry, the, purple, yam, d, alata, is, also, eaten, in, india, where, it, is, also, called,
