psychosis, is, a, condition, of, the, mind, or, psyche, that, results, in, difficulties, determining, what, is, real, and, what, is, not, real, symptoms, may, include, delusions, and, hallucinations, among, other, features, additional, symptoms, are, incoherent, speech, and, behavior, that, is, inappropriate, for, a, given, situation, there, may, also, be, sleep, problems, social, withdrawal, lack, of, motivation, and, difficulties, carrying, out, daily, activities, psychosis, can, have, serious, adverse, outcomes, psychosis, can, have, several, different, causes, these, include, mental, illness, such, as, schizophrenia, or, schizoaffective, disorder, bipolar, disorder, sensory, deprivation, wernicke, korsakoff, syndrome, or, cerebral, beriberi, and, in, rare, cases, major, depression, psychotic, depression, other, causes, include, trauma, sleep, deprivation, some, medical, conditions, certain, medications, and, drugs, such, as, alcohol, cannabis, hallucinogens, and, stimulants, one, type, known, as, postpartum, psychosis, can, occur, after, giving, birth, the, neurotransmitter, dopamine, is, believed, to, play, an, important, role, acute, psychosis, is, termed, primary, if, it, results, from, a, psychiatric, condition, and, secondary, if, it, is, caused, by, another, medical, condition, or, drugs, the, diagnosis, of, a, mental, health, condition, requires, excluding, other, potential, causes, testing, may, be, done, to, check, for, central, nervous, system, diseases, toxins, or, other, health, problems, as, a, cause, treatment, may, include, antipsychotic, medication, psychotherapy, and, social, support, early, treatment, appears, to, improve, outcomes, medications, appear, to, have, a, moderate, effect, outcomes, depend, on, the, underlying, cause, in, the, united, states, about, 3, of, people, develop, psychosis, at, some, point, in, their, lives, the, condition, has, been, described, since, at, least, the, 4th, century, bc, by, hippocrates, and, possibly, as, early, as, 1500, bc, in, the, egyptian, ebers, papyrus, a, hallucination, is, defined, as, sensory, perception, in, the, absence, of, external, stimuli, hallucinations, are, different, from, illusions, and, perceptual, distortions, which, are, the, misperception, of, external, stimuli, hallucinations, may, occur, in, any, of, the, senses, and, take, on, almost, any, form, they, may, consist, of, simple, sensations, such, as, lights, colors, sounds, tastes, or, smells, or, more, detailed, experiences, such, as, seeing, and, interacting, with, animals, and, people, hearing, voices, and, having, complex, tactile, sensations, hallucinations, are, generally, characterized, as, being, vivid, and, uncontrollable, auditory, hallucinations, particularly, experiences, of, hearing, voices, are, the, most, common, and, often, prominent, feature, of, psychosis, up, to, 15, of, the, general, population, may, experience, auditory, hallucinations, though, not, all, are, due, to, psychosis, the, prevalence, of, auditory, hallucinations, in, patients, with, schizophrenia, is, generally, put, around, 70, but, may, go, as, high, as, 98, reported, prevalence, in, bipolar, disorder, ranges, between, 11, and, 68, during, the, early, 20th, century, auditory, hallucinations, were, second, to, visual, hallucinations, in, frequency, but, they, are, now, the, most, common, manifestation, of, schizophrenia, although, rates, vary, between, cultures, and, regions, auditory, hallucinations, are, most, commonly, intelligible, voices, when, voices, are, present, the, average, number, has, been, estimated, at, three, content, like, frequency, differs, significantly, especially, across, cultures, and, demographics, people, who, experience, auditory, hallucinations, can, frequently, identify, the, loudness, location, of, origin, and, may, settle, on, identities, for, voices, western, cultures, are, associated, with, auditory, experiences, concerning, religious, content, frequently, related, to, sin, hallucinations, may, command, a, person, to, do, something, potentially, dangerous, when, combined, with, delusions, so, called, minor, hallucinations, such, as, extracampine, hallucinations, or, false, perceptions, of, people, or, movement, occurring, outside, of, one, s, visual, field, frequently, occur, in, neurocognitive, disorders, such, as, parkinson, s, disease, visual, hallucinations, occur, in, roughly, a, third, of, people, with, schizophrenia, although, rates, as, high, as, 55, are, reported, the, prevalence, in, bipolar, disorder, is, around, 15, content, commonly, involves, animate, objects, although, perceptual, abnormalities, such, as, changes, in, lighting, shading, streaks, or, lines, may, be, seen, visual, abnormalities, may, conflict, with, proprioceptive, information, and, visions, may, include, experiences, such, as, the, ground, tilting, lilliputian, hallucinations, are, less, common, in, schizophrenia, and, are, more, common, in, various, types, of, encephalopathy, such, as, peduncular, hallucinosis, a, visceral, hallucination, also, called, a, cenesthetic, hallucination, is, characterized, by, visceral, sensations, in, the, absence, of, stimuli, cenesthetic, hallucinations, may, include, sensations, of, burning, or, re, arrangement, of, internal, organs, psychosis, may, involve, delusional, beliefs, a, delusion, is, a, fixed, false, idiosyncratic, belief, which, does, not, change, even, when, presented, with, incontrovertible, evidence, to, the, contrary, delusions, are, context, and, culture, dependent, a, belief, that, inhibits, critical, functioning, and, is, widely, considered, delusional, in, one, population, may, be, common, and, even, adaptive, in, another, or, in, the, same, population, at, a, later, time, since, normative, views, may, contradict, available, evidence, a, belief, need, not, contravene, cultural, standards, in, order, to, be, considered, delusional, prevalence, in, schizophrenia, is, generally, considered, at, least, 90, and, around, 50, in, bipolar, disorder, the, dsm, 5, characterizes, certain, delusions, as, bizarre, if, they, are, clearly, implausible, or, are, incompatible, with, the, surrounding, cultural, context, the, concept, of, bizarre, delusions, has, many, criticisms, the, most, prominent, being, judging, its, presence, is, not, highly, reliable, even, among, trained, individuals, a, delusion, may, involve, diverse, thematic, content, the, most, common, type, is, a, persecutory, delusion, in, which, a, person, believes, that, an, entity, seeks, to, harm, them, others, include, delusions, of, reference, the, belief, that, some, element, of, one, s, experience, represents, a, deliberate, and, specific, act, by, or, message, from, some, other, entity, delusions, of, grandeur, the, belief, that, one, possesses, special, power, or, influence, beyond, one, s, actual, limits, thought, broadcasting, the, belief, that, one, s, thoughts, are, audible, and, thought, insertion, the, belief, that, one, s, thoughts, are, not, one, s, own, a, delusion, may, also, involve, misidentification, of, objects, persons, or, environs, that, the, afflicted, should, reasonably, be, able, to, recognize, such, examples, include, cotard, s, syndrome, the, belief, that, oneself, is, partly, or, wholly, dead, and, clinical, lycanthropy, the, belief, that, oneself, is, or, has, transformed, into, an, animal, the, subject, matter, of, delusions, seems, to, reflect, the, current, culture, in, a, particular, time, and, location, for, example, in, the, us, during, the, early, 1900s, syphilis, was, a, common, topic, during, the, second, world, war, germany, during, the, cold, war, communists, and, in, recent, years, technology, has, been, a, focus, some, psychologists, such, as, those, who, practice, the, open, dialogue, method, believe, that, the, content, of, psychosis, represents, an, underlying, thought, process, that, may, in, part, be, responsible, for, psychosis, though, the, accepted, medical, position, is, that, psychosis, is, due, to, a, brain, disorder, historically, karl, jaspers, classified, psychotic, delusions, into, primary, and, secondary, types, primary, delusions, are, defined, as, arising, suddenly, and, not, being, comprehensible, in, terms, of, normal, mental, processes, whereas, secondary, delusions, are, typically, understood, as, being, influenced, by, the, person, s, background, or, current, situation, e, g, ethnicity, also, religious, superstitious, or, political, beliefs, disorganization, is, split, into, disorganized, speech, or, thought, and, grossly, disorganized, motor, behavior, disorganized, speech, or, thought, also, called, formal, thought, disorder, is, disorganization, of, thinking, that, is, inferred, from, speech, characteristics, of, disorganized, speech, include, rapidly, switching, topics, called, derailment, or, loose, association, switching, to, topics, that, are, unrelated, called, tangential, thinking, incomprehensible, speech, called, word, salad, or, incoherence, disorganized, motor, behavior, includes, repetitive, odd, or, sometimes, purposeless, movement, disorganized, motor, behavior, rarely, includes, catatonia, and, although, it, was, a, historically, prominent, symptom, it, is, rarely, seen, today, whether, this, is, due, to, historically, used, treatments, or, the, lack, thereof, is, unknown, catatonia, describes, a, profoundly, agitated, state, in, which, the, experience, of, reality, is, generally, considered, impaired, there, are, two, primary, manifestations, of, catatonic, behavior, the, classic, presentation, is, a, person, who, does, not, move, or, interact, with, the, world, in, any, way, while, awake, this, type, of, catatonia, presents, with, waxy, flexibility, waxy, flexibility, is, when, someone, physically, moves, part, of, a, catatonic, person, s, body, and, the, person, stays, in, the, position, even, if, it, is, bizarre, and, otherwise, nonfunctional, such, as, moving, a, person, s, arm, straight, up, in, the, air, and, the, arm, staying, there, the, other, type, of, catatonia, is, more, of, an, outward, presentation, of, the, profoundly, agitated, state, described, above, it, involves, excessive, and, purposeless, motor, behaviour, as, well, as, an, extreme, mental, preoccupation, that, prevents, an, intact, experience, of, reality, an, example, is, someone, walking, very, fast, in, circles, to, the, exclusion, of, anything, else, with, a, level, of, mental, preoccupation, meaning, not, focused, on, anything, relevant, to, the, situation, that, was, not, typical, of, the, person, prior, to, the, symptom, onset, in, both, types, of, catatonia, there, is, generally, no, reaction, to, anything, that, happens, outside, of, them, it, is, important, to, distinguish, catatonic, agitation, from, severe, bipolar, mania, although, someone, could, have, both, negative, symptoms, include, reduced, emotional, expression, decreased, motivation, avolition, and, reduced, spontaneous, speech, poverty, of, speech, alogia, individuals, with, this, condition, lack, interest, and, spontaneity, and, have, the, inability, to, feel, pleasure, anhedonia, altered, behavioral, inhibition, system, functioning, could, possibly, cause, reduced, sustained, attention, in, psychosis, and, overall, contribute, to, more, negative, reactions, psychosis, is, rare, in, adolescents, young, people, who, have, psychosis, may, have, trouble, connecting, with, the, world, around, them, and, may, experience, hallucinations, or, delusions, adolescents, with, psychosis, may, also, have, cognitive, deficits, that, may, make, it, harder, for, the, youth, to, socialize, and, work, potential, impairments, include, reduced, speed, of, mental, processing, ability, to, focus, without, getting, distracted, limited, attention, span, and, deficits, in, verbal, memory, if, an, adolescent, is, experiencing, psychosis, they, most, likely, have, comorbidity, meaning, that, they, could, have, multiple, mental, illnesses, because, of, this, it, may, be, difficult, to, determine, whether, it, is, psychosis, or, autism, spectrum, disorder, social, or, generalized, anxiety, disorder, or, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, the, symptoms, of, psychosis, may, be, caused, by, serious, psychiatric, disorders, such, as, schizophrenia, a, number, of, medical, illnesses, and, trauma, psychosis, may, also, be, temporary, or, transient, and, be, caused, by, medications, or, substance, use, disorder, substance, induced, psychosis, brief, hallucinations, are, not, uncommon, in, those, without, any, psychiatric, disease, including, healthy, children, causes, or, triggers, include, traumatic, life, events, have, been, linked, with, an, elevated, risk, of, developing, psychotic, symptoms, childhood, trauma, has, specifically, been, shown, to, be, a, predictor, of, adolescent, and, adult, psychosis, individuals, with, psychotic, symptoms, are, three, times, more, likely, to, have, experienced, childhood, trauma, e, g, physical, or, sexual, abuse, physical, or, emotional, neglect, than, those, in, the, general, population, increased, individual, vulnerability, toward, psychosis, may, interact, with, traumatic, experiences, promoting, an, onset, of, future, psychotic, symptoms, particularly, during, sensitive, developmental, periods, importantly, the, relationship, between, traumatic, life, events, and, psychotic, symptoms, appears, to, be, dose, dependent, in, which, multiple, traumatic, life, events, accumulate, compounding, symptom, expression, and, severity, however, acute, stressful, events, can, also, trigger, brief, psychotic, episodes, trauma, prevention, and, early, intervention, may, be, an, important, target, for, decreasing, the, incidence, of, psychotic, disorders, and, ameliorating, its, effects, a, healthy, person, could, become, psychotic, if, he, is, placed, in, an, empty, room, with, no, light, and, sound, after, 15, minutes, a, phenomenon, known, as, sensory, deprivation, neuroticism, a, personality, trait, associated, with, vulnerability, to, stressors, is, an, independent, predictor, of, the, development, of, psychosis, from, a, diagnostic, standpoint, organic, disorders, were, believed, to, be, caused, by, physical, illness, affecting, the, brain, that, is, psychiatric, disorders, secondary, to, other, conditions, while, functional, disorders, were, considered, disorders, of, the, functioning, of, the, mind, in, the, absence, of, physical, disorders, that, is, primary, psychological, or, psychiatric, disorders, subtle, physical, abnormalities, have, been, found, in, illnesses, traditionally, considered, functional, such, as, schizophrenia, the, dsm, iv, tr, avoids, the, functional, organic, distinction, and, instead, lists, traditional, psychotic, illnesses, psychosis, due, to, general, medical, conditions, and, substance, induced, psychosis, primary, psychiatric, causes, of, psychosis, include, the, following, psychotic, symptoms, may, also, be, seen, in, subtypes, of, psychosis, include, cycloid, psychosis, is, typically, an, acute, self, limiting, form, of, psychosis, with, psychotic, and, mood, symptoms, that, progress, from, normal, to, full, blown, usually, between, a, few, hours, to, days, and, not, related, to, drug, intake, or, brain, injury, while, proposed, as, a, distinct, entity, clinically, separate, from, schizophrenia, and, affective, disorders, cycloid, psychosis, is, not, formally, acknowledged, by, current, icd, or, dsm, criteria, its, unclear, place, in, psychiatric, nosology, has, likely, contributed, to, the, limited, scientific, investigation, and, literature, on, the, topic, postpartum, psychosis, is, a, rare, yet, serious, and, debilitating, form, of, psychosis, symptoms, range, from, fluctuating, moods, and, insomnia, to, mood, incongruent, delusions, related, to, the, individual, or, the, infant, women, experiencing, postpartum, psychosis, are, at, increased, risk, for, suicide, or, infanticide, many, women, who, experience, first, time, psychosis, from, postpartum, often, have, bipolar, disorder, meaning, they, could, experience, an, increase, of, psychotic, episodes, even, after, postpartum, a, very, large, number, of, medical, conditions, can, cause, psychosis, sometimes, called, secondary, psychosis, examples, include, various, psychoactive, substances, both, legal, and, illegal, have, been, implicated, in, causing, exacerbating, or, precipitating, psychotic, states, or, disorders, in, users, with, varying, levels, of, evidence, this, may, be, upon, intoxication, for, a, more, prolonged, period, after, use, or, upon, withdrawal, individuals, who, experience, substance, induced, psychosis, tend, to, have, a, greater, awareness, of, their, psychosis, and, tend, to, have, higher, levels, of, suicidal, thinking, compared, to, those, who, have, a, primary, psychotic, illness, drugs, commonly, alleged, to, induce, psychotic, symptoms, include, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, cathinones, psychedelic, drugs, such, as, lsd, and, psilocybin, opioid, receptor, agonists, such, as, enadoline, and, salvinorin, a, and, nmda, receptor, antagonists, such, as, phencyclidine, and, ketamine, caffeine, may, worsen, symptoms, in, those, with, schizophrenia, and, cause, psychosis, at, very, high, doses, in, people, without, the, condition, cannabis, and, other, illicit, recreational, drugs, are, often, associated, with, psychosis, in, adolescents, and, cannabis, use, before, 15, years, old, may, increase, the, risk, of, psychosis, in, adulthood, approximately, three, percent, of, people, with, alcoholism, experience, psychosis, during, acute, intoxication, or, withdrawal, alcohol, related, psychosis, may, manifest, itself, through, a, kindling, mechanism, the, mechanism, of, alcohol, related, psychosis, is, due, to, the, long, term, effects, of, alcohol, consumption, resulting, in, distortions, to, neuronal, membranes, gene, expression, as, well, as, thiamine, deficiency, it, is, possible, that, hazardous, alcohol, use, via, a, kindling, mechanism, can, cause, the, development, of, a, chronic, substance, induced, psychotic, disorder, i, e, schizophrenia, the, effects, of, an, alcohol, related, psychosis, include, an, increased, risk, of, depression, and, suicide, as, well, as, causing, psychosocial, impairments, delirium, tremens, a, symptom, of, chronic, alcoholism, that, can, appear, in, the, acute, withdrawal, phase, shares, many, symptoms, with, alcohol, related, psychosis, suggesting, a, common, mechanism, according, to, current, studies, cannabis, use, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, psychotic, disorders, and, the, more, often, cannabis, is, used, the, more, likely, a, person, is, to, develop, a, psychotic, illness, furthermore, people, with, a, history, of, cannabis, use, develop, psychotic, symptoms, earlier, than, those, who, have, never, used, cannabis, some, debate, exists, regarding, the, causal, relationship, between, cannabis, use, and, psychosis, with, some, studies, suggesting, that, cannabis, use, hastens, the, onset, of, psychosis, primarily, in, those, with, pre, existing, vulnerability, indeed, cannabis, use, plays, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, psychosis, in, vulnerable, individuals, and, cannabis, use, in, adolescence, should, be, discouraged, some, studies, indicate, that, the, effects, of, two, active, compounds, in, cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol, thc, and, cannabidiol, cbd, have, opposite, effects, with, respect, to, psychosis, while, thc, can, induce, psychotic, symptoms, in, healthy, individuals, limited, evidence, suggests, that, cbd, may, have, antipsychotic, effects, methamphetamine, induces, a, psychosis, in, 26, 46, percent, of, heavy, users, some, of, these, people, develop, a, long, lasting, psychosis, that, can, persist, for, longer, than, six, months, those, who, have, had, a, short, lived, psychosis, from, methamphetamine, can, have, a, relapse, of, the, methamphetamine, psychosis, years, later, after, a, stressful, event, such, as, severe, insomnia, or, a, period, of, hazardous, alcohol, use, despite, not, relapsing, back, to, methamphetamine, individuals, who, have, a, long, history, of, methamphetamine, use, and, who, have, experienced, psychosis, in, the, past, from, methamphetamine, use, are, highly, likely, to, re, experience, methamphetamine, psychosis, if, drug, use, is, recommenced, methamphetamine, induced, psychosis, is, likely, gated, by, genetic, vulnerability, which, can, produce, long, term, changes, in, brain, neurochemistry, following, repetitive, use, administration, or, sometimes, withdrawal, of, a, large, number, of, medications, may, provoke, psychotic, symptoms, drugs, that, can, induce, psychosis, experimentally, or, in, a, significant, proportion, of, people, include, the, first, brain, image, of, an, individual, with, psychosis, was, completed, as, far, back, as, 1935, using, a, technique, called, pneumoencephalography, a, painful, and, now, obsolete, procedure, where, cerebrospinal, fluid, is, drained, from, around, the, brain, and, replaced, with, air, to, allow, the, structure, of, the, brain, to, show, up, more, clearly, on, an, x, ray, picture, both, first, episode, psychosis, and, high, risk, status, is, associated, with, reductions, in, grey, matter, volume, gmv, first, episode, psychotic, and, high, risk, populations, are, associated, with, similar, but, distinct, abnormalities, in, gmv, reductions, in, the, right, middle, temporal, gyrus, right, superior, temporal, gyrus, stg, right, parahippocampus, right, hippocampus, right, middle, frontal, gyrus, and, left, anterior, cingulate, cortex, acc, are, observed, in, high, risk, populations, reductions, in, first, episode, psychosis, span, a, region, from, the, right, stg, to, the, right, insula, left, insula, and, cerebellum, and, are, more, severe, in, the, right, acc, right, stg, insula, and, cerebellum, another, meta, analysis, reported, bilateral, reductions, in, insula, operculum, stg, medial, frontal, cortex, and, acc, but, also, reported, increased, gmv, in, the, right, lingual, gyrus, and, left, precentral, gyrus, the, kraepelinian, dichotomy, is, made, questionable, by, grey, matter, abnormalities, in, bipolar, and, schizophrenia, schizophrenia, is, distinguishable, from, bipolar, in, that, regions, of, grey, matter, reduction, are, generally, larger, in, magnitude, although, adjusting, for, gender, differences, reduces, the, difference, to, the, left, dorsomedial, prefrontal, cortex, and, right, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, during, attentional, tasks, first, episode, psychosis, is, associated, with, hypoactivation, in, the, right, middle, frontal, gyrus, a, region, generally, described, as, encompassing, the, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, dlpfc, altered, behavioral, inhibition, system, functioning, could, possibly, cause, reduced, sustained, attention, in, psychosis, and, overall, contribute, to, more, negative, reactions, in, congruence, with, studies, on, grey, matter, volume, hypoactivity, in, the, right, insula, and, right, inferior, parietal, lobe, is, also, reported, during, cognitive, tasks, hypoactivities, in, the, right, insula, dacc, and, the, left, precuneus, as, well, as, reduced, deactivations, in, the, right, basal, ganglia, right, thalamus, right, inferior, frontal, and, left, precentral, gyri, are, observed, these, results, are, highly, consistent, and, replicable, possibly, except, the, abnormalities, of, the, right, inferior, frontal, gyrus, decreased, grey, matter, volume, in, conjunction, with, bilateral, hypoactivity, is, observed, in, anterior, insula, dorsal, medial, frontal, cortex, and, dorsal, acc, decreased, grey, matter, volume, and, bilateral, hyperactivity, is, reported, in, posterior, insula, ventral, medial, frontal, cortex, and, ventral, acc, studies, during, acute, experiences, of, hallucinations, demonstrate, increased, activity, in, primary, or, secondary, sensory, cortices, as, auditory, hallucinations, are, most, common, in, psychosis, most, robust, evidence, exists, for, increased, activity, in, the, left, middle, temporal, gyrus, left, superior, temporal, gyrus, and, left, inferior, frontal, gyrus, i, e, broca, s, area, activity, in, the, ventral, striatum, hippocampus, and, acc, are, related, to, the, lucidity, of, hallucinations, and, indicate, that, activation, or, involvement, of, emotional, circuitry, are, key, to, the, impact, of, abnormal, activity, in, sensory, cortices, together, these, findings, indicate, abnormal, processing, of, internally, generated, sensory, experiences, coupled, with, abnormal, emotional, processing, results, in, hallucinations, one, proposed, model, involves, a, failure, of, feedforward, networks, from, sensory, cortices, to, the, inferior, frontal, cortex, which, normally, cancel, out, sensory, cortex, activity, during, internally, generated, speech, the, resulting, disruption, in, expected, and, perceived, speech, is, thought, to, produce, lucid, hallucinatory, experiences, the, two, factor, model, of, delusions, posits, that, dysfunction, in, both, belief, formation, systems, and, belief, evaluation, systems, are, necessary, for, delusions, dysfunction, in, evaluations, systems, localized, to, the, right, lateral, prefrontal, cortex, regardless, of, delusion, content, is, supported, by, neuroimaging, studies, and, is, congruent, with, its, role, in, conflict, monitoring, in, healthy, persons, abnormal, activation, and, reduced, volume, is, seen, in, people, with, delusions, as, well, as, in, disorders, associated, with, delusions, such, as, frontotemporal, dementia, psychosis, and, lewy, body, dementia, furthermore, lesions, to, this, region, are, associated, with, jumping, to, conclusions, damage, to, this, region, is, associated, with, post, stroke, delusions, and, hypometabolism, this, region, associated, with, caudate, strokes, presenting, with, delusions, the, aberrant, salience, model, suggests, that, delusions, are, a, result, of, people, assigning, excessive, importance, to, irrelevant, stimuli, in, support, of, this, hypothesis, regions, normally, associated, with, the, salience, network, demonstrate, reduced, grey, matter, in, people, with, delusions, and, the, neurotransmitter, dopamine, which, is, widely, implicated, in, salience, processing, is, also, widely, implicated, in, psychotic, disorders, specific, regions, have, been, associated, with, specific, types, of, delusions, the, volume, of, the, hippocampus, and, parahippocampus, is, related, to, paranoid, delusions, in, alzheimer, s, disease, and, has, been, reported, to, be, abnormal, post, mortem, in, one, person, with, delusions, capgras, delusions, have, been, associated, with, occipito, temporal, damage, and, may, be, related, to, failure, to, elicit, normal, emotions, or, memories, in, response, to, faces, psychosis, is, associated, with, ventral, striatal, vs, which, is, the, part, of, the, brain, that, is, involved, with, the, desire, to, naturally, satisfy, the, body, s, needs, when, high, reports, of, negative, symptoms, were, recorded, there, were, significant, irregularities, in, the, left, vs, anhedonia, the, inability, to, feel, pleasure, is, a, commonly, reported, symptom, in, psychosis, experiences, are, present, in, most, people, with, schizophrenia, anhedonia, arises, as, a, result, of, the, inability, to, feel, motivation, and, drive, towards, both, the, desire, to, engage, in, as, well, as, to, complete, tasks, and, goals, previous, research, has, indicated, that, a, deficiency, in, the, neural, representation, in, regards, to, goals, and, the, motivation, to, achieve, them, has, demonstrated, that, when, a, reward, is, not, present, a, strong, reaction, is, noted, in, the, ventral, striatum, reinforcement, learning, is, intact, when, contingencies, about, stimulus, reward, are, implicit, but, not, when, they, require, explicit, neural, processing, reward, prediction, errors, are, what, the, actual, reward, is, versus, what, the, reward, was, predicted, to, be, in, most, cases, positive, prediction, errors, are, considered, an, abnormal, occurrence, a, positive, prediction, error, response, occurs, when, there, is, an, increased, activation, in, a, brain, region, typically, the, striatum, in, response, to, unexpected, rewards, a, negative, prediction, error, response, occurs, when, there, is, a, decreased, activation, in, a, region, when, predicted, rewards, do, not, occur, anterior, cingulate, cortex, acc, response, taken, as, an, indicator, of, effort, allocation, does, not, increase, with, reward, or, reward, probability, increase, and, is, associated, with, negative, symptoms, deficits, in, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, dlpfc, activity, and, failure, to, improve, performance, on, cognitive, tasks, when, offered, monetary, incentives, are, present, and, dopamine, mediated, functions, are, abnormal, psychosis, has, been, traditionally, linked, to, the, overactivity, of, the, neurotransmitter, dopamine, in, particular, to, its, effect, in, the, mesolimbic, pathway, the, two, major, sources, of, evidence, given, to, support, this, theory, are, that, dopamine, receptor, d2, blocking, drugs, i, e, antipsychotics, tend, to, reduce, the, intensity, of, psychotic, symptoms, and, that, drugs, that, accentuate, dopamine, release, or, inhibit, its, reuptake, such, as, amphetamines, and, cocaine, can, trigger, psychosis, in, some, people, see, stimulant, psychosis, nmda, receptor, dysfunction, has, been, proposed, as, a, mechanism, in, psychosis, this, theory, is, reinforced, by, the, fact, that, dissociative, nmda, receptor, antagonists, such, as, ketamine, pcp, and, dextromethorphan, at, large, overdoses, induce, a, psychotic, state, the, symptoms, of, dissociative, intoxication, are, also, considered, to, mirror, the, symptoms, of, schizophrenia, including, negative, symptoms, nmda, receptor, antagonism, in, addition, to, producing, symptoms, reminiscent, of, psychosis, mimics, the, neurophysiological, aspects, such, as, reduction, in, the, amplitude, of, p50, p300, and, mmn, evoked, potentials, hierarchical, bayesian, neurocomputational, models, of, sensory, feedback, in, agreement, with, neuroimaging, literature, link, nmda, receptor,

predictions, errors, excessive, prediction, errors, in, response, to, stimuli, that, would, normally, not, produce, such, a, response, is, thought, to, root, from, conferring, excessive, salience, to, otherwise, mundane, events, dysfunction, higher, up, in, the, hierarchy, where, representation, is, more, abstract, could, result, in, delusions, the, common, finding, of, reduced, gad67, expression, in, psychotic, disorders, may, explain, enhanced, ampa, mediated, signaling, caused, by, reduced, gabaergic, inhibition, the, connection, between, dopamine, and, psychosis, is, generally, believed, to, be, complex, while, dopamine, receptor, d2, suppresses, adenylate, cyclase, activity, the, d1, receptor, increases, it, if, d2, blocking, drugs, are, administered, the, blocked, dopamine, spills, over, to, the, d1, receptors, the, increased, adenylate, cyclase, activity, affects, genetic, expression, in, the, nerve, cell, which, takes, time, hence, antipsychotic, drugs, take, a, week, or, two, to, reduce, the, symptoms, of, psychosis, moreover, newer, and, equally, effective, antipsychotic, drugs, actually, block, slightly, less, dopamine, in, the, brain, than, older, drugs, whilst, also, blocking, 5, ht2a, receptors, suggesting, the, dopamine, hypothesis, may, be, oversimplified, soyka, and, colleagues, found, no, evidence, of, dopaminergic, dysfunction, in, people, with, alcohol, induced, psychosis, and, zoldan, et, al, reported, moderately, successful, use, of, ondansetron, a, 5, ht, 3, receptor, antagonist, in, the, treatment, of, levodopa, psychosis, in, parkinson, s, disease, patients, a, review, found, an, association, between, a, first, episode, of, psychosis, and, prediabetes, prolonged, or, high, dose, use, of, psychostimulants, can, alter, normal, functioning, making, it, similar, to, the, manic, phase, of, bipolar, disorder, nmda, antagonists, replicate, some, of, the, so, called, negative, symptoms, like, thought, disorder, in, subanesthetic, doses, doses, insufficient, to, induce, anesthesia, and, catatonia, in, high, doses, psychostimulants, especially, in, one, already, prone, to, psychotic, thinking, can, cause, some, positive, symptoms, such, as, delusional, beliefs, particularly, those, persecutory, in, nature, cross, cultural, studies, into, schizophrenia, have, found, that, individual, experiences, of, psychosis, and,

mental, health, subjects, were, found, to, report, their, hallucinations, as, having, violent, content, and, self, describing, as, crazy, this, lived, experience, is, at, odds, with, the, lived, experience, of, subjects, in, accra, ghana, who, describe, the, voices, they, hear, as, having, spiritual, meaning, and, are, often, reported, as, positive, in, nature, or, subjects, in, chennai,

level, of, 18, symptom, constructs, of, psychosis, such, as, hostility, suspicion, hallucination, and, grandiosity, it, is, based, on, the, clinician, s, interview, with, the, patient, and, observations, of, the, patient, s, behavior, over, the, previous, 2, 3, days, the, patient, s, family, can, also, answer, questions, on, the, behavior, report, during, the, initial, assessment, and,

as, psychotic, or, on, the, schizophrenia, spectrum, if, they, involve, hallucinations, delusions, disorganized, thinking, grossly, disorganized, motor, behavior, or, negative, symptoms, the, dsm, 5, does, not, include, psychosis, as, a, definition, in, the, glossary, although, it, defines, psychotic, features, as, well, as, psychoticism, with, respect, to, personality, disorder, the, icd, 10, has, no, specific, definition, of, psychosis, the, psq, psychosis, screening, questionnaire, is, the, most, common, tool, in, detecting, psychotic, symptoms, and, it, includes, five, root, questions, that, assess, the, presence, of, ple, mania, thought, insertion, paranoia, strange, experiences, and, perceptual, disturbances, the, different, tools, used, to, assess, symptom, severity, include, the, revised, behavior, and, symptom, identification, scale, basis, r, a, 24, item, self, report, instrument, with, six, scales, psychosis, depression, functioning, interpersonal, problems, alcohol,

properties, and, is, an, acceptable, brief, alternative, to, the, scl, 90, r, these, seem, to, be, the, most, accurate, tools, at, the, moment, but, a, research, in, 2007, that, focused, on, quantifying, self, reports, of, auditory, verbal, hallucinations, avh, in, persons, with, psychosis, suggest, that, the, hamilton, program, for, schizophrenia, voices, questionnaire, hpsvq, is, also, potentially, a, reliable, and, useful, measure, for, specifically, quantifying, avhs, in, relation, to, psychosis, factor, analysis, of, symptoms, generally, regarded, as, psychosis, frequently, yields, a, five, factor, solution, albeit, five, factors, that, are, distinct, from, the, five, domains, defined, by, the, dsm, 5, to, encompass, psychotic, or, schizophrenia, spectrum, disorders, the, five, factors, are, frequently, labeled, as, hallucinations, delusions, disorganization, excitement, and, emotional, distress, the, dsm, 5, emphasizes, a, psychotic, spectrum, wherein, the, low, end, is, characterized, by, schizoid, personality, disorder, and, the, high, end, is, characterized, by, schizophrenia, the, evidence, for, the, effectiveness, of, early, interventions, to, prevent, psychosis, appeared, inconclusive, but, psychosis, caused, by, drugs, can, be, prevented, whilst, early, intervention, in, those, with, a, psychotic, episode, might, improve, short, term, outcomes, little, benefit, was, seen, from, these, measures, after, five, years, however, there, is, evidence, that, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, may, reduce, the, risk, of, becoming, psychotic, in, those, at, high, risk, and, in, 2014, the, uk, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, nice, recommended, preventive, cbt, for, people, at, risk, of, psychosis, the, treatment, of, psychosis, depends, on, the, specific, diagnosis, such, as, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, or, substance, intoxication, the, first, line, treatment, for, many, psychotic, disorders, is, antipsychotic, medication, which, can, reduce, the, positive, symptoms, of, psychosis, in, about, 7, to, 14, days, for, youth, or, adolescents, treatment, options, include, medications, psychological, interventions, and, social, interventions, the, choice, of, which, antipsychotic, to, use, is, based, on, benefits, risks, and, costs, it, is, debatable, whether, as, a, class, typical, or, atypical, antipsychotics, are, better, tentative, evidence, supports, that, amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone, and, clozapine, may, be, more, effective, for, positive, symptoms, but, result, in, more, side, effects, typical, antipsychotics, have, equal, drop, out, and, symptom, relapse, rates, to, atypicals, when, used, at, low, to, moderate, dosages, there, is, a, good, response, in, 40, 50, a, partial, response, in, 30, 40, and, treatment, resistance, failure, of, symptoms, to, respond, satisfactorily, after, six, weeks, to, two, or, three, different, antipsychotics, in, 20, of, people, clozapine, is, an, effective, treatment, for, those, who, respond, poorly, to, other, drugs, treatment, resistant, or, refractory, schizophrenia, but, it, has, the, potentially, serious, side, effect, of, agranulocytosis, lowered, white, blood, cell, count, in, less, than, 4, of, people, most, people, on, antipsychotics, get, side, effects, people, on, typical, antipsychotics, tend, to, have, a, higher, rate, of, extrapyramidal, side, effects, while, some, atypicals, are, associated, with, considerable, weight, gain, diabetes, and, risk, of, metabolic, syndrome, this, is, most, pronounced, with, olanzapine, while, risperidone, and, quetiapine, are, also, associated, with, weight, gain, risperidone, has, a, similar, rate, of, extrapyramidal, symptoms, to, haloperidol, psychological, treatments, such, as, acceptance, and, commitment, therapy, act, are, possibly, useful, in, the, treatment, of, psychosis, helping, people, to, focus, more, on, what, they, can, do, in, terms, of,

program, named, coping, with, voices, cwv, suggest, that, the, program, has, promise, for, increasing, access, to, cbtp, it, also, associated, benefits, in, the, management, of, distressing, psychotic, symptoms, and, improved, social, functioning, when, cbt, and, the, other, psychosocial, interventions, these, are, used, without, antipsychotic, medications, they, may, be, somewhat, effective, for, some, people, especially, for, cbt, need, adapted, treatment, and, soteria, early, intervention, in, psychosis, is, based, on, the, observation, that, identifying, and, treating, someone, in, the, early, stages, of, a, psychosis, can, improve, their, longer, term, outcome, this, approach, advocates, the, use, of, an, intensive, multi, disciplinary, approach, during, what, is, known, as, the, critical, period, where, intervention, is, the, most, effective, and, prevents, the, long, term, morbidity, associated, with, chronic, psychotic, illness, addressing, systematic, reform, is, essential, to, creating, effective, prevention, as, well, as, supporting, treatments, and, recovery, for, those, with, psychosis, waghorn, et, al, suggest, that, education, interventions, can, be, a, building, block, to, support, those, with, psychosis, to, successfully, participate, in, society, in, their, study, they, analyse, the, relationship, between, successful, education, attainment, and, psychosis, findings, suggest, proportionately, more, school, aged, persons, with, psychosis, discontinued, their, education, compared, to, those, without, psychosis, waghorn, et, al, finds, that, specialised, supported, education, for, those, with, psychotic, disorders, can, help, lead, to, successful, education, attainment, additionally, future, employment, outcomes, are, relative, to, such, education, attainment, established, approaches, to, supported, education, in, the, us, include, three, basic, models, self, contained, classrooms, onsite, support, model, and, the, mobile, support, model, each, model, includes, the, participation, of, mental, health, service, staff, or, educational, facility, staff, in, the, student, s, education, arrangements, potential, benefits, of, specialised, supported, education, found, from, this, study, include, coordination, with, other, service, providers, e, g, income, support, housing, etc, to, prevent, disrupting, education, providing, specialised, career, counselling, development, of, coping, skills, in, the, academic, environment, these, examples, provide, beneficial, ways, for, people, with, psychosis, to, finish, studies, successfully, as, well, as, counter, future, experiences, of, psychosis, the, word, psychosis, was, introduced, to, the, psychiatric, literature, in, 1841, by, karl, friedrich, canstatt, in, his, work, handbuch, der, medizinischen, klinik, he, used, it, as, a, shorthand, for, psychic, neurosis, at, that, time, neurosis, meant, any, disease, of, the, nervous, system, and, canstatt, was, thus, referring, to, what, was, considered, a, psychological, manifestation, of, brain, disease, ernst, von, feuchtersleben, is, also, widely, credited, as, introducing, the, term, in, 1845, as, an, alternative, to, insanity, and, mania, the, term, stems, from, modern, latin, psychosis, a, giving, soul, or, life, to, animating, quickening, and, that, from, ancient, greek, psyche, soul, and, the, suffix, osis, in, this, case, abnormal, condition, in, its, adjective, form, psychotic, references, to, psychosis, can, be, found, in, both, clinical, and, non, clinical, discussions, however, in, a, non, clinical, context, psychotic, is, a, nonspecific, colloquialism, used, to, mean, insane, the, word, was, also, used, to, distinguish, a, condition, considered, a, disorder, of, the, mind, as, opposed, to, neurosis, which, was, considered, a, disorder, of, the, nervous, system, the, psychoses, thus, became, the, modern, equivalent, of, the, old, notion, of, madness, and, hence, there, was, much, debate, on, whether, there, was, only, one, unitary, or, many, forms, of, the, new, disease, one, type, of, broad, usage, would, later, be, narrowed, down, by, koch, in, 1891, to, the, psychopathic, inferiorities, later, renamed, abnormal, personalities, by, schneider, the, division, of, the, major, psychoses, into, manic, depressive, illness, now, called, bipolar, disorder, and, dementia, praecox, now, called, schizophrenia, was, made, by, emil, kraepelin, who, attempted, to, create, a, synthesis, of, the, various, mental, disorders, identified, by, 19th, century, psychiatrists, by, grouping, diseases, together, based, on, classification, of, common, symptoms, kraepelin, used, the, term, manic, depressive, insanity, to, describe, the, whole, spectrum, of, mood, disorders, in, a, far, wider, sense, than, it, is, usually, used, today, in, kraepelin, s, classification, this, would, include, unipolar, clinical, depression, as, well, as, bipolar, disorder, and, other, mood, disorders, such, as, cyclothymia, these, are, characterised, by, problems, with, mood, control, and, the, psychotic, episodes, appear, associated, with, disturbances, in, mood, and, patients, often, have, periods, of, normal, functioning, between, psychotic, episodes, even, without, medication, schizophrenia, is, characterized, by, psychotic, episodes, that, appear, unrelated, to, disturbances, in, mood, and, most, non, medicated, patients, show, signs, of, disturbance, between, psychotic, episodes, written, record, of, supernatural, causes, and, resultant, treatments, can, be, traced, back, to, the, new, testament, mark, 5, 8, 13, describes, a, man, displaying, what, would, today, be, described, as, psychotic, symptoms, christ, cured, this, demonic, madness, by, casting, out, the, demons, and, hurling, them, into, a, herd, of, swine, exorcism, is, still, utilized, in, some, religious, circles, as, a, treatment, for, psychosis, presumed, to, be, demonic, possession, a, research, study, of, out, patients, in, psychiatric, clinics, found, that, 30, percent, of, religious, patients, attributed, the, cause, of, their, psychotic, symptoms, to, evil, spirits, many, of, these, patients, underwent, exorcistic, healing, rituals, that, though, largely, regarded, as, positive, experiences, by, the, patients, had, no, effect, on, symptomology, results, did, however, show, a, significant, worsening, of, psychotic, symptoms, associated, with, exclusion, of, medical, treatment, for, coercive, forms, of, exorcism, the, medical, teachings, of, the, fourth, century, philosopher, and, physician, hippocrates, of, cos, proposed, a, natural, rather, than, supernatural, cause, of, human, illness, in, hippocrates, work, the, hippocratic, corpus, a, holistic, explanation, for, health, and, disease, was, developed, to, include, madness, and, other, diseases, of, the, mind, hippocrates, writes, men, ought, to, know, that, from, the, brain, and, from, the, brain, only, arise, our, pleasures, joys, laughter, and, jests, as, well, as, our, sorrows, pains, griefs, and, tears, through, it, in, particular, we, think, see, hear, and, distinguish, the, ugly, from, the, beautiful, the, bad, from, the, good, the, pleasant, from, the, unpleasant, it, is, the, same, thing, which, makes, us, mad, or, delirious, inspires, us, with, dread, and, fear, whether, by, night, or, by, day, brings, sleeplessness, inopportune, mistakes, aimless, anxieties, absentmindedness, and, acts, that, are, contrary, to, habit, hippocrates, espoused, a, theory, of, humoralism, wherein, disease, is, resultant, of, a, shifting, balance, in, bodily, fluids, including, blood, phlegm, black, bile, and, yellow, bile, according, to, humoralism, each, fluid, or, humour, has, temperamental, or, behavioral, correlates, in, the, case, of, psychosis, symptoms, are, thought, to, be, caused, by, an, excess, of, both, blood, and, yellow, bile, thus, the, proposed, surgical, intervention, for, psychotic, or, manic, behavior, was, bloodletting, 18th, century, physician, educator, and, widely, considered, founder, of, american, psychiatry, benjamin, rush, also, prescribed, bloodletting, as, a, first, line, treatment, for, psychosis, although, not, a, proponent, of, humoralism, rush, believed, that, active, purging, and, bloodletting, were, efficacious, corrections, for, disruptions, in, the, circulatory, system, a, complication, he, believed, was, the, primary, cause, of, insanity, although, rush, s, treatment, modalities, are, now, considered, antiquated, and, brutish, his, contributions, to, psychiatry, namely, the, biological, underpinnings, of, psychiatric, phenomenon, including, psychosis, have, been, invaluable, to, the, field, in, honor, of, such, contributions, benjamin, rush, s, image, is, in, the, official, seal, of, the, american, psychiatric, association, early, 20th, century, treatments, for, severe, and, persisting, psychosis, were, characterized, by, an, emphasis, on, shocking, the, nervous, system, such, therapies, include, insulin, shock, therapy, cardiazol, shock, therapy, and, electroconvulsive, therapy, despite, considerable, risk, shock, therapy, was, considered, highly, efficacious, in, the, treatment, of, psychosis, including, schizophrenia, the, acceptance, of, high, risk, treatments, led, to, more, invasive, medical, interventions, including, psychosurgery, in, 1888, swiss, psychiatrist, gottlieb, burckhardt, performed, the, first, medically, sanctioned, psychosurgery, in, which, the, cerebral, cortex, was, excised, although, some, patients, showed, improvement, of, symptoms, and, became, more, subdued, one, patient, died, and, several, developed, aphasia, or, seizure, disorders, burckhardt, would, go, on, to, publish, his, clinical, outcomes, in, a, scholarly, paper, this, procedure, was, met, with, criticism, from, the, medical, community, and, his, academic, and, surgical, endeavors, were, largely, ignored, in, the, late, 1930s, egas, moniz, conceived, the, leucotomy, aka, prefrontal, lobotomy, in, which, the, fibers, connecting, the, frontal, lobes, to, the, rest, of, the, brain, were, severed, moniz, s, primary, inspiration, stemmed, from, a, demonstration, by, neuroscientists, john, fulton, and, carlyle, s, 1935, experiment, in, which, two, chimpanzees, were, given, leucotomies, and, pre, and, post, surgical, behavior, was, compared, prior, to, the, leucotomy, the, chimps, engaged, in, typical, behavior, including, throwing, feces, and, fighting, after, the, procedure, both, chimps, were, pacified, and, less, violent, during, the, q, a, moniz, asked, if, such, a, procedure, could, be, extended, to, human, subjects, a, question, that, fulton, admitted, was, quite, startling, moniz, would, go, on, to, extend, the, controversial, practice, to, humans, with, various, psychotic, disorders, an, endeavor, for, which, he, received, a, nobel, prize, in, 1949, between, the, late, 1930s, and, early, 1970s, the, leucotomy, was, a, widely, accepted, practice, often, performed, in, non, sterile, environments, such, as, small, outpatient, clinics, and, patient, homes, psychosurgery, remained, standard, practice, until, the, discovery, of, antipsychotic, pharmacology, in, the, 1950s, the, first, clinical, trial, of, antipsychotics, also, commonly, known, as, neuroleptics, for, the, treatment, of, psychosis, took, place, in, 1952, chlorpromazine, brand, name, thorazine, passed, clinical, trials, and, became, the, first, antipsychotic, medication, approved, for, the, treatment, of, both, acute, and, chronic, psychosis, although, the, mechanism, of, action, was, not, discovered, until, 1963, the, administration, of, chlorpromazine, marked, the, advent, of, the, dopamine, antagonist, or, first, generation, antipsychotic, while, clinical, trials, showed, a, high, response, rate, for, both, acute, psychosis, and, disorders, with, psychotic, features, the, side, effects, were, particularly, harsh, which, included, high, rates, of, often, irreversible, parkinsonian, symptoms, such, as, tardive, dyskinesia, with, the, advent, of, atypical, antipsychotics, also, known, as, second, generation, antipsychotics, came, a, dopamine, antagonist, with, a, comparable, response, rate, but, a, far, different, though, still, extensive, side, effect, profile, that, included, a, lower, risk, of, parkinsonian, symptoms, but, a, higher, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, atypical, antipsychotics, remain, the, first, line, treatment, for, psychosis, associated, with, various, psychiatric, and, neurological, disorders, including, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, major, depressive, disorder, anxiety, disorders, dementia, and, some, autism, spectrum, disorders, dopamine, is, now, one, of, the, primary, neurotransmitters, implicated, in, psychotic, symptomology, blocking, dopamine, receptors, namely, the, dopamine, d2, receptors, and, decreasing, dopaminergic, activity, continues, to, be, an, effective, but, highly, unrefined, effect, of, antipsychotics, which, are, commonly, used, to, treat, psychosis, recent, pharmacological, research, suggests, that, the, decrease, in, dopaminergic, activity, does, not, eradicate, psychotic, delusions, or, hallucinations, but, rather, attenuates, the, reward, mechanisms, involved, in, the, development, of, delusional, thinking, that, is, connecting, or, finding, meaningful, relationships, between, unrelated, stimuli, or, ideas, the, author, of, this, research, paper, acknowledges, the, importance, of, future, investigation, the, model, presented, here, is, based, on, incomplete, knowledge, related, to, dopamine, schizophrenia, and, antipsychotics, and, as, such, will, need, to, evolve, as, more, is, known, about, these, freud, s, former, student, wilhelm, reich, explored, independent, insights, into, the, physical, effects, of, neurotic, and, traumatic, upbringing, and, published, his, holistic, psychoanalytic, treatment, with, a, schizophrenic, with, his, incorporation, of, breathwork, and, insight, with, the, patient, a, young, woman, she, achieved, sufficient, self, management, skills, to, end, the, therapy, lacan, extended, freud, s, ideas, to, create, a, psychoanalytic, model, of, psychosis, based, upon, the, concept, of, foreclosure, the, rejection, of, the, symbolic, concept, of, the, father, psychiatrist, david, healy, has, criticised, pharmaceutical, companies, for, promoting, simplified, biological, theories, of, mental, illness, that, seem, to, imply, the, primacy, of, pharmaceutical, treatments, while, ignoring, social, and, developmental, factors, that, are, known, important, influences, in, the, etiology, of, psychosis, the, classification, of, psychosis, as, a, social, disability, is, a, common, occurrence, psychosis, is, considered, to, be, among, the, top, 10, causes, of, social, disability, among, adult, men, and, women, in, developed, countries, and, the, traditional, negative, narrative, around, disability, has, been, shown, to, strongly, and, adversely, influence, the, pathways, through, employment, and, education, for, people, experiencing, psychosis, social, disability, by, way, of, social, disconnection, is, a, significant, public, health, concern, and, is, associated, with, a, broad, range, of, negative, outcomes, including, premature, mortality, social, disconnection, refers, to, the, ongoing, absence, of, family, or, social, relationships, with, marginal, participation, in, social, activities, research, on, psychosis, found, that, reduced, participation, in, social, networks, not, only, negatively, effects, the, individual, on, a, physical, and, mental, level, it, has, been, shown, that, failure, to, be, included, in, social, networks, influences, the, individual, s, ability, to, participate, in, the, wider, community, through, employment, and, education, opportunities, equal, opportunity, to, participate, in, meaningful, relationships, with, friends, family, and, partners, as, well, as, engaging, in, social, constructs, such, as, employment, can,

long, term, health, and, well, being, as, well, as, the, contributions, they, are, able, to, make, to, their, immediate, social, connections, and, the, wider, community, further, research, in, the, form, of, randomized, controlled, trials, is, needed, to, determine, the, effectiveness, of, treatment, approaches, for, helping, adolescents, with, psychosis, through, 10, randomized, clinical, trials, studies, showed, that, early, intervention, services, eis, for, patients, with, early, phase, schizophrenia, spectrum, disorders, have, generated, promising, outcomes, eis, are, specifically, intended, to, fulfill, the, needs, of, patients, with, early, phase, psychosis, in, addition, one, meta, analysis, that, consisted, of, four, randomized, clinical, trials, has, examined, and, discovered, the, efficacy, of, eis, to, therapy, as, usual, tau, for, early, phase, psychosis, revealing, that, eis, techniques, are, superior, to, tau, a, study, suggests, that, combining, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, with, slowmo, an, app, that, helps, notice, their, unhelpful, quick, thinking, might, be, more, effective, for, treating, paranoia, in, people, with, psychosis, than, cbt,
