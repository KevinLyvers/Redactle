sociality, is, the, degree, to, which, individuals, in, an, animal, population, tend, to, associate, in, social, groups, gregariousness, and, form, cooperative, societies, sociality, is, a, survival, response, to, evolutionary, pressures, for, example, when, a, mother, wasp, stays, near, her, larvae, in, the, nest, parasites, are, less, likely, to, eat, the, larvae, biologists, suspect, that, pressures, from, parasites, and, other, predators, selected, this, behavior, in, wasps, of, the, family, vespidae, this, wasp, behaviour, evidences, the, most, fundamental, characteristic, of, animal, sociality, parental, investment, parental, investment, is, any, expenditure, of, resources, time, energy, social, capital, to, benefit, one, s, offspring, parental, investment, detracts, from, a, parent, s, capacity, to, invest, in, future, reproduction, and, aid, to, kin, including, other, offspring, an, animal, that, cares, for, its, young, but, shows, no, other, sociality, traits, is, said, to, be, subsocial, an, animal, that, exhibits, a, high, degree, of, sociality, is, called, a, social, animal, the, highest, degree, of, sociality, recognized, by, sociobiologists, is, eusociality, a, eusocial, taxon, is, one, that, exhibits, overlapping, adult, generations, reproductive, division, of, labor, cooperative, care, of, young, and, in, the, most, refined, cases, a, biological, caste, system, solitary, animals, such, as, the, jaguar, do, not, associate, except, for, courtship, and, mating, if, an, animal, taxon, shows, a, degree, of, sociality, beyond, courtship, and, mating, but, lacks, any, of, the, characteristics, of, eusociality, it, is, said, to, be, presocial, although, presocial, species, are, much, more, common, than, eusocial, species, eusocial, species, have, disproportionately, large, populations, the, entomologist, charles, d, michener, published, a, classification, system, for, presociality, in, 1969, building, on, the, earlier, work, of, suzanne, batra, who, coined, the, words, eusocial, and, quasisocial, in, 1966, michener, used, these, terms, in, his, study, of, bees, but, also, saw, a, need, for, additional, classifications, subsocial, communal, and, semisocial, in, his, use, of, these, words, he, did, not, generalize, beyond, insects, e, o, wilson, later, refined, batra, s, definition, of, quasisocial, subsociality, is, common, in, the, animal, kingdom, in, subsocial, taxa, parents, care, for, their, young, for, some, length, of, time, even, if, the, period, of, care, is, very, short, the, animal, is, still, described, as, subsocial, if, adult, animals, associate, with, other, adults, they, are, not, called, subsocial, but, are, ranked, in, some, other, classification, according, to, their, social, behaviours, if, occasionally, associating, or, nesting, with, other, adults, is, a, taxon, s, most, social, behaviour, then, members, of, those, populations, are, said, to, be, solitary, but, social, see, wilson, 1971, for, definitions, and, further, sub, classes, of, varieties, of, subsociality, choe, crespi, 1997, and, costa, 2006, give, readable, overviews, subsociality, is, widely, distributed, among, the, winged, insects, and, has, evolved, independently, many, times, insect, groups, that, contain, at, least, some, subsocial, species, are, shown, in, bold, italics, on, a, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, neoptera, note, that, many, non, subsocial, groups, are, omitted, embioptera, webspinners, blattodea, cockroaches, inc, eusocial, termites, mantodea, mantises, orthoptera, grasshoppers, crickets, dermaptera, earwigs, zoraptera, angel, insects, thysanoptera, thrips, membracidae, treehoppers, thorn, bugs, pentatomidae, shield, bugs, reduviidae, predatory, bugs, tingidae, lace, bugs, psocoptera, bark, lice, staphylinidae, rove, beetles, silphidae, carrion, beetles, passalidae, bessbugs, scarabaeidae, scarabs, tenebrionidae, leaf, flower, beetles, erotylidae, pleasing, fungus, beetles, chrysomelidae, leaf, beetles, raphidioptera, snakeflies, neuroptera, lacewings, alderflies, and, allies, antliophora, true, flies, scorpionflies, fleas, trichoptera, caddisflies, lepidoptera, butterflies, and, moths, hymenoptera, sawflies, wasps, ants, bees, apart, from, eusocial, species, solitary, but, social, animals, forage, separately, but, some, individuals, sleep, in, the, same, location, or, share, nests, the, home, ranges, of, females, usually, overlap, whereas, those, of, males, do, not, males, usually, do, not, associate, with, other, males, and, male, offspring, are, usually, evicted, upon, maturity, however, this, is, opposite, among, cassowaries, for, example, among, primates, this, form, of, social, organization, is, most, common, among, the, nocturnal, strepsirrhine, species, and, tarsiers, solitary, but, social, species, include, mouse, lemurs, lorises, and, orangutans, some, individual, cetaceans, adopt, a, solitary, but, social, behavior, that, is, they, live, apart, from, their, own, species, but, interact, with, humans, this, behavior, has, been, observed, in, species, including, bottlenose, dolphin, common, dolphin, striped, dolphin, beluga, risso, s, dolphin, and, orca, notable, individuals, include, pelorus, jack, 1888, 1912, ti, o, 1994, 1995, and, fungie, 1983, 2020, at, least, 32, solitary, sociable, dolphins, were, recorded, between, 2008, and, 2019, sociobiologists, place, communal, quasisocial, and, semisocial, animals, into, a, meta, class, the, parasocial, the, two, commonalities, of, parasocial, taxa, are, the, exhibition, of, parental, investment, and, socialization, in, a, single, cooperative, dwelling, communal, quasisocial, and, semisocial, groups, differ, in, a, few, ways, in, a, communal, group, adults, cohabit, in, a, single, nest, site, but, they, each, care, for, their, own, young, quasisocial, animals, cohabit, but, they, also, share, the, responsibilities, of, brood, care, this, has, been, observed, in, some, hymenoptera, and, spider, taxa, as, well, as, in, some, other, invertebrates, a, semisocial, population, has, the, features, of, communal, and, quasisocial, populations, but, they, also, have, a, biological, caste, system, that, delegates, labor, according, to, whether, or, not, an, individual, is, able, to, reproduce, beyond, parasociality, is, eusociality, eusocial, insect, societies, have, all, the, characteristics, of, a, semisocial, one, except, overlapping, generations, of, adults, cohabit, and, share, in, the, care, of, young, this, means, that, more, than, one, adult, generation, is, alive, at, the, same, time, and, that, the, older, generations, also, care, for, the, newest, offspring, eusocial, societies, have, overlapping, adult, generations, cooperative, care, of, young, and, division, of, reproductive, labor, when, organisms, in, a, species, are, born, with, physical, characteristics, specific, to, a, caste, which, never, changes, throughout, their, lives, this, exemplifies, the, highest, acknowledged, degree, of, sociality, eusociality, has, evolved, in, several, orders, of, insects, common, examples, of, eusociality, are, from, hymenoptera, ants, bees, sawflies, and, wasps, and, blattodea, infraorder, isoptera, termites, but, some, coleoptera, such, as, the, beetle, austroplatypus, incompertus, hemiptera, bugs, such, as, pemphigus, spyrothecae, and, thysanoptera, thrips, are, described, as, eusocial, eusocial, species, that, lack, this, criterion, of, morphological, caste, differentiation, are, said, to, be, primitively, eusocial, two, potential, examples, of, primitively, eusocial, mammals, are, the, naked, mole, rat, and, the, damaraland, mole, rat, heterocephalus, glaber, and, fukomys, damarensis, respectively, both, species, are, diploid, and, highly, inbred, and, they, aid, in, raising, their, siblings, and, relatives, all, of, whom, are, born, from, a, single, reproductive, queen, they, usually, live, in, harsh, or, limiting, environments, a, study, conducted, by, o, riain, and, faulkes, in, 2008, suggests, that, due, to, regular, inbreeding, avoidance, mole, rats, sometimes, outbreed, and, establish, new, colonies, when, resources, are, sufficient, eusociality, has, arisen, among, some, crustaceans, that, live, in, groups, in, a, restricted, area, synalpheus, regalis, are, snapping, shrimp, that, rely, on, fortress, defense, they, live, in, groups, of, closely, related, individuals, amidst, tropical, reefs, and, sponges, each, group, has, one, breeding, female, she, is, protected, by, a, large, number, of, male, defenders, who, are, armed, with, enlarged, snapping, claws, as, with, other, eusocial, societies, there, is, a, single, shared, living, space, for, the, colony, members, and, the, non, breeding, members, act, to, defend, it, e, o, wilson, and, bert, h, lldobler, controversially, claimed, in, 2005, that, humans, exhibit, sufficient, sociality, to, be, counted, as, a, eusocial, species, and, that, this, enabled, them, to, enjoy, spectacular, ecological, success, and, dominance, over, ecological, competitors
