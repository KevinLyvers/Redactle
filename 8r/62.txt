a, capillary, is, a, small, blood, vessel, from, 5, to, 10, micrometres, in, diameter, and, is, part, of, the, microcirculation, system, capillaries, are, microvessels, and, the, smallest, blood, vessels, in, the, body, they, are, composed, of, only, the, tunica, intima, the, innermost, layer, of, an, artery, or, vein, consisting, of, a, thin, wall, of, simple, squamous, endothelial, cells, they, are, the, site, of, the, exchange, of, many, substances, from, the, surrounding, interstitial, fluid, and, they, convey, blood, from, the, smallest, branches, of, the, arteries, arterioles, to, those, of, the, veins, venules, other, substances, which, cross, capillaries, include, water, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, urea, glucose, uric, acid, lactic, acid, and, creatinine, lymph, capillaries, connect, with, larger, lymph, vessels, to, drain, lymphatic, fluid, collected, in, microcirculation, capillary, comes, from, the, latin, word, capillaris, meaning, of, or, resembling, hair, with, use, in, english, beginning, in, the, mid, 17th, century, the, meaning, stems, from, the, tiny, hairlike, diameter, of, a, capillary, while, capillary, is, usually, used, as, a, noun, the, word, also, is, used, as, an, adjective, as, in, capillary, action, in, which, a, liquid, flows, without, influence, of, external, forces, such, as, gravity, blood, flows, from, the, heart, through, arteries, which, branch, and, narrow, into, arterioles, and, then, branch, further, into, capillaries, where, nutrients, and, wastes, are, exchanged, the, capillaries, then, join, and, widen, to, become, venules, which, in, turn, widen, and, converge, to, become, veins, which, then, return, blood, back, to, the, heart, through, the, venae, cavae, in, the, mesentery, metarterioles, form, an, additional, stage, between, arterioles, and, capillaries, individual, capillaries, are, part, of, the, capillary, bed, an, interweaving, network, of, capillaries, supplying, tissues, and, organs, the, more, metabolically, active, a, tissue, is, the, more, capillaries, are, required, to, supply, nutrients, and, carry, away, products, of, metabolism, there, are, two, types, of, capillaries, true, capillaries, which, branch, from, arterioles, and, provide, exchange, between, tissue, and, the, capillary, blood, and, sinusoids, a, type, of, open, pore, capillary, found, in, the, liver, bone, marrow, anterior, pituitary, gland, and, brain, circumventricular, organs, capillaries, and, sinusoids, are, short, vessels, that, directly, connect, the, arterioles, and, venules, at, opposite, ends, of, the, beds, metarterioles, are, found, primarily, in, the, mesenteric, microcirculation, lymphatic, capillaries, are, slightly, larger, in, diameter, than, blood, capillaries, and, have, closed, ends, unlike, the, blood, capillaries, open, at, one, end, to, the, arterioles, and, open, at, the, other, end, to, the, venules, this, structure, permits, interstitial, fluid, to, flow, into, them, but, not, out, lymph, capillaries, have, a, greater, internal, oncotic, pressure, than, blood, capillaries, due, to, the, greater, concentration, of, plasma, proteins, in, the, lymph, blood, capillaries, are, categorized, into, three, types, continuous, fenestrated, and, sinusoidal, also, known, as, discontinuous, continuous, capillaries, are, continuous, in, the, sense, that, the, endothelial, cells, provide, an, uninterrupted, lining, and, they, only, allow, smaller, molecules, such, as, water, and, ions, to, pass, through, their, intercellular, clefts, lipid, soluble, molecules, can, passively, diffuse, through, the, endothelial, cell, membranes, along, concentration, gradients, continuous, capillaries, can, be, further, divided, into, two, subtypes, fenestrated, capillaries, have, pores, known, as, fenestrae, latin, for, windows, in, the, endothelial, cells, that, are, 60, 80, nanometres, nm, in, diameter, they, are, spanned, by, a, diaphragm, of, radially, oriented, fibrils, that, allows, small, molecules, and, limited, amounts, of, protein, to, diffuse, in, the, renal, glomerulus, there, are, cells, with, no, diaphragms, called, podocyte, foot, processes, or, pedicels, which, have, slit, pores, with, a, function, analogous, to, the, diaphragm, of, the, capillaries, both, of, these, types, of, blood, vessels, have, continuous, basal, laminae, and, are, primarily, located, in, the, endocrine, glands, intestines, pancreas, and, the, glomeruli, of, the, kidney, sinusoidal, capillaries, or, discontinuous, capillaries, are, a, special, type, of, open, pore, capillary, also, known, as, a, sinusoid, that, have, wider, fenestrations, that, are, 30, 40, micrometres, m, in, diameter, with, wider, openings, in, the, endothelium, fenestrated, capillaries, have, diaphragms, that, cover, the, pores, whereas, sinusoids, lack, a, diaphragm, and, just, have, an, open, pore, these, types, of, blood, vessels, allow, red, and, white, blood, cells, 7, 5, m, 25, m, diameter, and, various, serum, proteins, to, pass, aided, by, a, discontinuous, basal, lamina, these, capillaries, lack, pinocytotic, vesicles, and, therefore, use, gaps, present, in, cell, junctions, to, permit, transfer, between, endothelial, cells, and, hence, across, the, membrane, sinusoids, are, irregular, spaces, filled, with, blood, and, are, mainly, found, in, the, liver, bone, marrow, spleen, and, brain, circumventricular, organs, during, early, embryonic, development, new, capillaries, are, formed, through, vasculogenesis, the, process, of, blood, vessel, formation, that, occurs, through, a, novel, production, of, endothelial, cells, that, then, form, vascular, tubes, the, term, angiogenesis, denotes, the, formation, of, new, capillaries, from, pre, existing, blood, vessels, and, already, present, endothelium, which, divides, the, small, capillaries, lengthen, and, interconnect, to, establish, a, network, of, vessels, a, primitive, vascular, network, that, vascularises, the, entire, yolk, sac, connecting, stalk, and, chorionic, villi, the, capillary, wall, performs, an, important, function, by, allowing, nutrients, and, waste, substances, to, pass, across, it, molecules, larger, than, 3, nm, such, as, albumin, and, other, large, proteins, pass, through, transcellular, transport, carried, inside, vesicles, a, process, which, requires, them, to, go, through, the, cells, that, form, the, wall, molecules, smaller, than, 3, nm, such, as, water, and, gases, cross, the, capillary, wall, through, the, space, between, cells, in, a, process, known, as, paracellular, transport, these, transport, mechanisms, allow, bidirectional, exchange, of, substances, depending, on, osmotic, gradients, capillaries, that, form, part, of, the, blood, brain, barrier, only, allow, for, transcellular, transport, as, tight, junctions, between, endothelial, cells, seal, the, paracellular, space, capillary, beds, may, control, their, blood, flow, via, autoregulation, this, allows, an, organ, to, maintain, constant, flow, despite, a, change, in, central, blood, pressure, this, is, achieved, by, myogenic, response, and, in, the, kidney, by, tubuloglomerular, feedback, when, blood, pressure, increases, arterioles, are, stretched, and, subsequently, constrict, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, bayliss, effect, to, counteract, the, increased, tendency, for, high, pressure, to, increase, blood, flow, in, the, lungs, special, mechanisms, have, been, adapted, to, meet, the, needs, of, increased, necessity, of, blood, flow, during, exercise, when, the, heart, rate, increases, and, more, blood, must, flow, through, the, lungs, capillaries, are, recruited, and, are, also, distended, to, make, room, for, increased, blood, flow, this, allows, blood, flow, to, increase, while, resistance, decreases, extreme, exercise, can, make, capillaries, vulnerable, with, a, breaking, point, similar, to, that, of, collagen, capillary, permeability, can, be, increased, by, the, release, of, certain, cytokines, anaphylatoxins, or, other, mediators, such, as, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, histamine, bradykinin, etc, highly, influenced, by, the, immune, system, the, transport, mechanisms, can, be, further, quantified, by, the, starling, equation, the, starling, equation, defines, the, forces, across, a, semipermeable, membrane, and, allows, calculation, of, the, net, flux, where, by, convention, outward, force, is, defined, as, positive, and, inward, force, is, defined, as, negative, the, solution, to, the, equation, is, known, as, the, net, filtration, or, net, fluid, movement, j, v, if, positive, fluid, will, tend, to, leave, the, capillary, filtration, if, negative, fluid, will, tend, to, enter, the, capillary, absorption, this, equation, has, a, number, of, important, physiologic, implications, especially, when, pathologic, processes, grossly, alter, one, or, more, of, the, variables, according, to, starling, s, equation, the, movement, of, fluid, depends, on, six, variables, disorders, of, capillary, formation, as, a, developmental, defect, or, acquired, disorder, are, a, feature, in, many, common, and, serious, disorders, within, a, wide, range, of, cellular, factors, and, cytokines, issues, with, normal, genetic, expression, and, bioactivity, of, the, vascular, growth, and, permeability, factor, vascular, endothelial, growth, factor, vegf, appear, to, play, a, major, role, in, many, of, the, disorders, cellular, factors, include, reduced, number, and, function, of, bone, marrow, derived, endothelial, progenitor, cells, and, reduced, ability, of, those, cells, to, form, blood, vessels, major, diseases, where, altering, capillary, formation, could, be, helpful, include, conditions, where, there, is, excessive, or, abnormal, capillary, formation, such, as, cancer, and, disorders, harming, eyesight, and, medical, conditions, in, which, there, is, reduced, capillary, formation, either, for, familial, or, genetic, reasons, or, as, an, acquired, problem, capillary, blood, sampling, can, be, used, to, test, for, blood, glucose, such, as, in, blood, glucose, monitoring, hemoglobin, ph, and, lactate, it, is, generally, performed, by, creating, a, small, cut, using, a, blood, lancet, followed, by, sampling, by, capillary, action, on, the, cut, with, a, test, strip, or, small, pipette, it, is, also, used, to, test, for, sexually, transmitted, infections, that, are, present, in, the, blood, stream, such, as, hiv, syphilis, and, hepatitis, b, and, c, where, a, finger, is, lanced, and, a, small, amount, of, blood, is, sampled, into, a, test, tube, william, harvey, did, not, explicitly, predict, the, existence, of, capillaries, but, he, saw, the, need, for, some, sort, of, connection, between, the, arterial, and, venous, systems, in, 1653, he, wrote, the, blood, doth, enter, into, every, member, through, the, arteries, and, does, return, by, the, veins, and, that, the, veins, are, the, vessels, and, ways, by, which, the, blood, is, returned, to, the, heart, itself, and, that, the, blood, in, the, members, and, extremities, does, pass, from, the, arteries, into, the, veins, either, mediately, by, an, anastomosis, or, immediately, through, the, porosities, of, the, flesh, or, both, ways, as, before, it, did, in, the, heart, and, thorax, out, of, the, veins, into, the, arteries, marcello, malpighi, was, the, first, to, observe, directly, and, correctly, describe, capillaries, discovering, them, in, a, frog, s, lung, 8, years, later, in, 1661, august, krogh, discovered, how, capillaries, provide, nutrients, to, animal, tissue, for, his, work, he, was, awarded, the, 1920, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine
