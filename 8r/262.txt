cellular, respiration, is, the, process, by, which, biological, fuels, are, oxidized, in, the, presence, of, an, inorganic, electron, acceptor, such, as, oxygen, to, drive, the, bulk, production, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, which, contains, energy, cellular, respiration, may, be, described, as, a, set, of, metabolic, reactions, and, processes, that, take, place, in, the, cells, of, organisms, to, convert, chemical, energy, from, nutrients, into, atp, and, then, release, waste, products, cellular, respiration, is, a, vital, process, that, occurs, in, the, cells, of, all, living, organisms, respiration, can, be, either, aerobic, requiring, oxygen, or, anaerobic, some, organisms, can, switch, between, aerobic, and, anaerobic, respiration, the, reactions, involved, in, respiration, are, catabolic, reactions, which, break, large, molecules, into, smaller, ones, producing, large, amounts, of, energy, atp, respiration, is, one, of, the, key, ways, a, cell, releases, chemical, energy, to, fuel, cellular, activity, the, overall, reaction, occurs, in, a, series, of, biochemical, steps, some, of, which, are, redox, reactions, although, cellular, respiration, is, technically, a, combustion, reaction, it, is, an, unusual, one, because, of, the, slow, controlled, release, of, energy, from, the, series, of, reactions, nutrients, that, are, commonly, used, by, animal, and, plant, cells, in, respiration, include, sugar, amino, acids, and, fatty, acids, and, the, most, common, oxidizing, agent, is, molecular, oxygen, o, 2, the, chemical, energy, stored, in, atp, the, bond, of, its, third, phosphate, group, to, the, rest, of, the, molecule, can, be, broken, allowing, more, stable, products, to, form, thereby, releasing, energy, for, use, by, the, cell, can, then, be, used, to, drive, processes, requiring, energy, including, biosynthesis, locomotion, or, transportation, of, molecules, across, cell, membranes, aerobic, respiration, requires, oxygen, o, 2, in, order, to, create, atp, although, carbohydrates, fats, and, proteins, are, consumed, as, reactants, aerobic, respiration, is, the, preferred, method, of, pyruvate, production, in, glycolysis, and, requires, pyruvate, to, the, mitochondria, in, order, to, be, fully, oxidized, by, the, citric, acid, cycle, the, products, of, this, process, are, carbon, dioxide, and, water, and, the, energy, transferred, is, used, to, make, bonds, between, adp, and, a, third, phosphate, group, to, form, atp, adenosine, triphosphate, by, substrate, level, phosphorylation, nadh, and, fadh, 2, the, negative, g, indicates, that, the, reaction, is, exothermic, exergonic, and, can, occur, spontaneously, the, potential, of, nadh, and, fadh, 2, is, converted, to, more, atp, through, an, electron, transport, chain, with, oxygen, and, protons, hydrogen, ions, as, the, terminal, electron, acceptors, most, of, the, atp, produced, by, aerobic, cellular, respiration, is, made, by, oxidative, phosphorylation, the, energy, released, is, used, to, create, a, chemiosmotic, potential, by, pumping, protons, across, a, membrane, this, potential, is, then, used, to, drive, atp, synthase, and, produce, atp, from, adp, and, a, phosphate, group, biology, textbooks, often, state, that, 38, atp, molecules, can, be, made, per, oxidized, glucose, molecule, during, cellular, respiration, 2, from, glycolysis, 2, from, the, krebs, cycle, and, about, 34, from, the, electron, transport, system, however, this, maximum, yield, is, never, quite, reached, because, of, losses, due, to, leaky, membranes, as, well, as, the, cost, of, moving, pyruvate, and, adp, into, the, mitochondrial, matrix, and, current, estimates, range, around, 29, to, 30, atp, per, glucose, aerobic, metabolism, is, up, to, 15, times, more, efficient, than, anaerobic, metabolism, which, yields, 2, molecules, of, atp, per, 1, molecule, of, glucose, however, some, anaerobic, organisms, such, as, methanogens, are, able, to, continue, with, anaerobic, respiration, yielding, more, atp, by, using, inorganic, molecules, other, than, oxygen, as, final, electron, acceptors, in, the, electron, transport, chain, they, share, the, initial, pathway, of, glycolysis, but, aerobic, metabolism, continues, with, the, krebs, cycle, and, oxidative, phosphorylation, the, post, glycolytic, reactions, take, place, in, the, mitochondria, in, eukaryotic, cells, and, in, the, cytoplasm, in, prokaryotic, cells, although, plants, are, net, consumers, of, carbon, dioxide, and, producers, of, oxygen, via, photosynthesis, plant, respiration, accounts, for, about, half, of, the, co, 2, generated, annually, by, terrestrial, ecosystems, 87, glycolysis, is, a, metabolic, pathway, that, takes, place, in, the, cytosol, of, cells, in, all, living, organisms, glycolysis, can, be, literally, translated, as, sugar, splitting, and, occurs, regardless, of, oxygen, s, presence, or, absence, in, aerobic, conditions, the, process, converts, one, molecule, of, glucose, into, two, molecules, of, pyruvate, pyruvic, acid, generating, energy, in, the, form, of, two, net, molecules, of, atp, four, molecules, of, atp, per, glucose, are, actually, produced, but, two, are, consumed, as, part, of, the, preparatory, phase, the, initial, phosphorylation, of, glucose, is, required, to, increase, the, reactivity, decrease, its, stability, in, order, for, the, molecule, to, be, cleaved, into, two, pyruvate, molecules, by, the, enzyme, aldolase, during, the, pay, off, phase, of, glycolysis, four, phosphate, groups, are, transferred, to, four, adp, by, substrate, level, phosphorylation, to, make, four, atp, and, two, nadh, are, produced, when, the, pyruvate, is, oxidized, the, overall, reaction, can, be, expressed, this, way, starting, with, glucose, 1, atp, is, used, to, donate, a, phosphate, to, glucose, to, produce, glucose, 6, phosphate, glycogen, can, be, converted, into, glucose, 6, phosphate, as, well, with, the, help, of, glycogen, phosphorylase, during, energy, metabolism, glucose, 6, phosphate, becomes, fructose, 6, phosphate, an, additional, atp, is, used, to, phosphorylate, fructose, 6, phosphate, into, fructose, 1, 6, bisphosphate, by, the, help, of, phosphofructokinase, fructose, 1, 6, biphosphate, then, splits, into, two, phosphorylated, molecules, with, three, carbon, chains, which, later, degrades, into, pyruvate, 88, 90, pyruvate, is, oxidized, to, acetyl, coa, and, co, 2, by, the, pyruvate, dehydrogenase, complex, pdc, the, pdc, contains, multiple, copies, of, three, enzymes, and, is, located, in, the, mitochondria, of, eukaryotic, cells, and, in, the, cytosol, of, prokaryotes, in, the, conversion, of, pyruvate, to, acetyl, coa, one, molecule, of, nadh, and, one, molecule, of, co, 2, is, formed, the, citric, acid, cycle, is, also, called, the, krebs, cycle, or, the, tricarboxylic, acid, cycle, when, oxygen, is, present, acetyl, coa, is, produced, from, the, pyruvate, molecules, created, from, glycolysis, once, acetyl, coa, is, formed, aerobic, or, anaerobic, respiration, can, occur, when, oxygen, is, present, the, mitochondria, will, undergo, aerobic, respiration, which, leads, to, the, krebs, cycle, however, if, oxygen, is, not, present, fermentation, of, the, pyruvate, molecule, will, occur, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, when, acetyl, coa, is, produced, the, molecule, then, enters, the, citric, acid, cycle, krebs, cycle, inside, the, mitochondrial, matrix, and, is, oxidized, to, co, 2, while, at, the, same, time, reducing, nad, to, nadh, nadh, can, be, used, by, the, electron, transport, chain, to, create, further, atp, as, part, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, to, fully, oxidize, the, equivalent, of, one, glucose, molecule, two, acetyl, coa, must, be, metabolized, by, the, krebs, cycle, two, low, energy, waste, products, h, 2, o, and, co, 2, are, created, during, this, cycle, the, citric, acid, cycle, is, an, 8, step, process, involving, 18, different, enzymes, and, co, enzymes, during, the, cycle, acetyl, coa, 2, carbons, oxaloacetate, 4, carbons, yields, citrate, 6, carbons, which, is, rearranged, to, a, more, reactive, form, called, isocitrate, 6, carbons, isocitrate, is, modified, to, become, ketoglutarate, 5, carbons, succinyl, coa, succinate, fumarate, malate, and, finally, oxaloacetate, the, net, gain, from, one, cycle, is, 3, nadh, and, 1, fadh, 2, as, hydrogen, proton, plus, electron, carrying, compounds, and, 1, high, energy, gtp, which, may, subsequently, be, used, to, produce, atp, thus, the, total, yield, from, 1, glucose, molecule, 2, pyruvate, molecules, is, 6, nadh, 2, fadh, 2, and, 2, atp, 90, 91, in, eukaryotes, oxidative, phosphorylation, occurs, in, the, mitochondrial, cristae, it, comprises, the, electron, transport, chain, that, establishes, a, proton, gradient, chemiosmotic, potential, across, the, boundary, of, the, inner, membrane, by, oxidizing, the, nadh, produced, from, the, krebs, cycle, atp, is, synthesized, by, the, atp, synthase, enzyme, when, the, chemiosmotic, gradient, is, used, to, drive, the, phosphorylation, of, adp, the, electrons, are, finally, transferred, to, exogenous, oxygen, and, with, the, addition, of, two, protons, water, is, formed, the, table, below, describes, the, reactions, involved, when, one, glucose, molecule, is, fully, oxidized, into, carbon, dioxide, it, is, assumed, that, all, the, reduced, coenzymes, are, oxidized, by, the, electron, transport, chain, and, used, for, oxidative, phosphorylation, although, there, is, a, theoretical, yield, of, 38, atp, molecules, per, glucose, during, cellular, respiration, such, conditions, are, generally, not, realized, because, of, losses, such, as, the, cost, of, moving, pyruvate, from, glycolysis, phosphate, and, adp, substrates, for, atp, synthesis, into, the, mitochondria, all, are, actively, transported, using, carriers, that, utilize, the, stored, energy, in, the, proton, electrochemical, gradient, the, outcome, of, these, transport, processes, using, the, proton, electrochemical, gradient, is, that, more, than, 3, h, are, needed, to, make, 1, atp, obviously, this, reduces, the, theoretical, efficiency, of, the, whole, process, and, the, likely, maximum, is, closer, to, 28, 30, atp, molecules, in, practice, the, efficiency, may, be, even, lower, because, the, inner, membrane, of, the, mitochondria, is, slightly, leaky, to, protons, other, factors, may, also, dissipate, the, proton, gradient, creating, an, apparently, leaky, mitochondria, an, uncoupling, protein, known, as, thermogenin, is, expressed, in, some, cell, types, and, is, a, channel, that, can, transport, protons, when, this, protein, is, active, in, the, inner, membrane, it, short, circuits, the, coupling, between, the, electron, transport, chain, and, atp, synthesis, the, potential, energy, from, the, proton, gradient, is, not, used, to, make, atp, but, generates, heat, this, is, particularly, important, in, brown, fat, thermogenesis, of, newborn, and, hibernating, mammals, according, to, some, newer, sources, the, atp, yield, during, aerobic, respiration, is, not, 36, 38, but, only, about, 30, 32, atp, molecules, 1, molecule, of, glucose, because, so, finally, we, have, per, molecule, of, glucose, altogether, this, gives, 4, 3, or, 5, 20, 3, 30, or, 32, atp, per, molecule, of, glucose, these, figures, may, still, require, further, tweaking, as, new, structural, details, become, available, the, above, value, of, 3, h, atp, for, the, synthase, assumes, that, the, synthase, translocates, 9, protons, and, produces, 3, atp, per, rotation, the, number, of, protons, depends, on, the, number, of, c, subunits, in, the, fo, c, ring, and, it, is, now, known, that, this, is, 10, in, yeast, fo, and, 8, for, vertebrates, including, one, h, for, the, transport, reactions, this, means, that, synthesis, of, one, atp, requires, 1, 10, 3, 4, 33, protons, in, yeast, and, 1, 8, 3, 3, 67, in, vertebrates, this, would, imply, that, in, human, mitochondria, the, 10, protons, from, oxidizing, nadh, would, produce, 2, 72, atp, instead, of, 2, 5, and, the, 6, protons, from, oxidizing, succinate, or, ubiquinol, would, produce, 1, 64, atp, instead, of, 1, 5, this, is, consistent, with, experimental, results, within, the, margin, of, error, described, in, a, recent, review, the, total, atp, yield, in, ethanol, or, lactic, acid, fermentation, is, only, 2, molecules, coming, from, glycolysis, because, pyruvate, is, not, transferred, to, the, mitochondrion, and, finally, oxidized, to, the, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, but, reduced, to, ethanol, or, lactic, acid, in, the, cytoplasm, without, oxygen, pyruvate, pyruvic, acid, is, not, metabolized, by, cellular, respiration, but, undergoes, a, process, of, fermentation, the, pyruvate, is, not, transported, into, the, mitochondrion, but, remains, in, the, cytoplasm, where, it, is, converted, to, waste, products, that, may, be, removed, from, the, cell, this, serves, the, purpose, of, oxidizing, the, electron, carriers, so, that, they, can, perform, glycolysis, again, and, removing, the, excess, pyruvate, fermentation, oxidizes, nadh, to, nad, so, it, can, be, re, used, in, glycolysis, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, fermentation, prevents, the, buildup, of, nadh, in, the, cytoplasm, and, provides, nad, for, glycolysis, this, waste, product, varies, depending, on, the, organism, in, skeletal, muscles, the, waste, product, is, lactic, acid, this, type, of, fermentation, is, called, lactic, acid, fermentation, in, strenuous, exercise, when, energy, demands, exceed, energy, supply, the, respiratory, chain, cannot, process, all, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, joined, by, nadh, during, anaerobic, glycolysis, nad, regenerates, when, pairs, of, hydrogen, combine, with, pyruvate, to, form, lactate, lactate, formation, is, catalyzed, by, lactate, dehydrogenase, in, a, reversible, reaction, lactate, can, also, be, used, as, an, indirect, precursor, for, liver, glycogen, during, recovery, when, oxygen, becomes, available, nad, attaches, to, hydrogen, from, lactate, to, form, atp, in, yeast, the, waste, products, are, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, this, type, of, fermentation, is, known, as, alcoholic, or, ethanol, fermentation, the, atp, generated, in, this, process, is, made, by, substrate, level, phosphorylation, which, does, not, require, oxygen, fermentation, is, less, efficient, at, using, the, energy, from, glucose, only, 2, atp, are, produced, per, glucose, compared, to, the, 38, atp, per, glucose, nominally, produced, by, aerobic, respiration, glycolytic, atp, however, is, produced, more, quickly, for, prokaryotes, to, continue, a, rapid, growth, rate, when, they, are, shifted, from, an, aerobic, environment, to, an, anaerobic, environment, they, must, increase, the, rate, of, the, glycolytic, reactions, for, multicellular, organisms, during, short, bursts, of, strenuous, activity, muscle, cells, use, fermentation, to, supplement, the, atp, production, from, the, slower, aerobic, respiration, so, fermentation, may, be, used, by, a, cell, even, before, the, oxygen, levels, are, depleted, as, is, the, case, in, sports, that, do, not, require, athletes, to, pace, themselves, such, as, sprinting, cellular, respiration, is, the, process, of, which, biological, fuels, are, oxidised, in, the, presence, of, an, inorganic, electron, acceptor, such, as, oxygen, to, produce, large, amounts, of, energy, to, drive, the, bulk, production, of, atp, anaerobic, respiration, is, used, by, microorganisms, either, bacteria, or, archaea, in, which, neither, oxygen, aerobic, respiration, nor, pyruvate, derivatives, fermentation, is, the, final, electron, acceptor, rather, an, inorganic, acceptor, such, as, sulfate, so, 2, 4, nitrate, no, 3, or, sulfur, s, is, used, such, organisms, could, be, found, in, unusual, places, such, as, underwater, caves, or, near, hydrothermal, vents, at, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, 66, 68, as, well, as, in, anoxic, soils, or, sediment, in, wetland, ecosystems, in, july, 2019, a, scientific, study, of, kidd, mine, in, canada, discovered, sulfur, breathing, organisms, which, live, 7900, feet, 2400, meters, below, the, surface, and, which, breathe, sulfur, in, order, to, survive, these, organisms, are, also, remarkable, due, to, consuming, minerals, such, as, pyrite, as, their, food, source
