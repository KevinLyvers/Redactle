the, nurse, shark, ginglymostoma, cirratum, is, an, elasmobranch, fish, in, the, family, ginglymostomatidae, the, conservation, status, of, the, nurse, shark, is, globally, assessed, as, vulnerable, in, the, iucn, list, of, threatened, species, they, are, considered, to, be, a, species, of, least, concern, in, the, united, states, and, in, the, bahamas, but, considered, to, be, near, threatened, in, the, western, atlantic, ocean, because, of, their, vulnerable, status, in, south, america, and, reported, threats, throughout, many, areas, of, central, america, and, the, caribbean, they, are, directly, targeted, in, some, fisheries, and, considered, by, catch, in, others, nurse, sharks, are, an, important, species, for, shark, research, they, are, robust, and, able, to, tolerate, capture, handling, and, tagging, extremely, well, as, inoffensive, as, nurse, sharks, may, appear, they, are, ranked, fourth, in, documented, shark, bites, on, humans, likely, due, to, incautious, behavior, by, divers, on, account, of, the, nurse, shark, s, calm, sedentary, nature, the, nurse, shark, genus, ginglymostoma, is, derived, from, greek, language, meaning, hinged, mouth, whereas, the, species, cirratum, is, derived, from, latin, meaning, having, curled, ringlets, based, on, morphological, similarities, ginglymostoma, is, believed, to, be, the, sister, genus, of, nebrius, with, both, being, placed, in, a, clade, that, also, include, species, pseudoginglymostoma, brevicaudatum, rhincodon, typus, and, stegostoma, fasciatum, the, nurse, shark, has, two, rounded, dorsal, fins, rounded, pectoral, fins, an, elongated, caudal, fin, and, a, broad, head, maximum, adult, length, is, currently, documented, as, 3, 08, m, 10, ft, 1, 1, 2, in, whereas, past, reports, of, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, and, corresponding, weights, of, up, to, 330, kg, 730, lb, are, likely, to, have, been, exaggerated, adult, nurse, sharks, are, brownish, in, color, newly, born, nurse, sharks, have, a, spotted, coloration, which, fades, with, age, and, are, about, 30, cm, in, length, when, nascent, the, nurse, shark, has, a, wide, but, patchy, geographical, distribution, along, tropical, and, subtropical, coastal, waters, of, the, eastern, atlantic, western, atlantic, and, eastern, pacific, in, the, eastern, atlantic, it, ranges, from, cape, verde, to, gabon, accidental, north, to, france, in, the, western, atlantic, including, the, caribbean, it, ranges, from, rhode, island, to, southern, brazil, and, in, the, east, pacific, from, baja, california, to, peru, nurse, sharks, are, a, typically, inshore, bottom, dwelling, species, juveniles, are, mostly, found, on, the, bottom, of, shallow, coral, reefs, seagrass, flats, and, around, mangrove, islands, whereas, older, individuals, typically, reside, in, and, around, deeper, reefs, and, rocky, areas, where, they, tend, to, seek, shelter, in, crevices, and, under, ledges, during, the, day, and, leave, their, shelter, at, night, to, feed, on, the, seabed, in, shallower, areas, nurse, sharks, are, also, subject, to, piebaldism, a, genetic, condition, that, results, in, a, partial, lack, of, body, pigmentation, and, a, speckled, body, nurse, sharks, are, opportunistic, predators, that, feed, primarily, on, small, fish, e, g, stingrays, and, some, invertebrates, e, g, crustaceans, molluscs, tunicates, they, are, typically, solitary, nocturnal, animals, rifling, through, bottom, sediments, in, search, of, food, at, night, but, are, often, gregarious, during, the, day, forming, large, sedentary, groups, nurse, sharks, are, obligate, suction, feeders, capable, of, generating, suction, forces, that, are, among, the, highest, recorded, for, any, aquatic, vertebrate, to, date, although, their, small, mouths, may, limit, the, size, of, prey, they, can, exhibit, a, suck, and, spit, behavior, and, or, shake, their, head, violently, to, reduce, the, size, of, food, items, nurse, sharks, are, exceptionally, sedentary, unlike, most, other, shark, species, nurse, sharks, show, strong, site, fidelity, typical, of, reef, sharks, and, it, is, one, of, the, few, shark, species, known, to, exhibit, mating, site, fidelity, as, they, will, return, to, the, same, breeding, grounds, time, and, time, again, american, alligators, alligator, mississippiensis, and, american, crocodiles, may, occasionally, prey, on, nurse, sharks, in, some, coastal, habitats, photographic, evidence, and, historical, accounts, suggest, that, encounters, between, species, are, commonplace, in, their, shared, habitats, nurse, sharks, are, ovoviviparous, with, fertilized, eggs, hatching, inside, the, female, the, mating, cycle, of, nurse, sharks, is, biennial, with, females, taking, up, to, 18, months, to, produce, a, new, batch, of, eggs, the, mating, season, runs, from, late, june, to, the, end, of, july, with, a, gestation, period, of, six, months, and, a, typical, litter, of, 21, 29, pups, the, young, nurse, sharks, are, born, fully, developed, at, about, 30, cm, long, nurse, sharks, engage, in, multiple, paternity, during, mating, season, a, study, conducted, over, a, ten, year, span, found, that, a, brood, of, nurse, sharks, had, more, genotypes, than, broods, with, one, father, 14, separate, genotypes, were, found, in, the, brood, examined, which, suggests, that, more, than, one, father, fertilized, the, mother, s, eggs, engagement, in, multiple, paternity, promotes, genetic, variation
