see, text, the, wrasses, are, a, family, labridae, of, marine, fish, many, of, which, are, brightly, colored, the, family, is, large, and, diverse, with, over, 600, species, in, 81, genera, which, are, divided, into, 9, subgroups, or, tribes, they, are, typically, small, most, of, them, less, than, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, long, although, the, largest, the, humphead, wrasse, can, measure, up, to, 2, 5, m, 8, 2, ft, they, are, efficient, carnivores, feeding, on, a, wide, range, of, small, invertebrates, many, smaller, wrasses, follow, the, feeding, trails, of, larger, fish, picking, up, invertebrates, disturbed, by, their, passing, juveniles, of, some, representatives, of, the, genera, bodianus, epibulus, cirrhilabrus, oxycheilinus, and, paracheilinus, hide, among, the, tentacles, of, the, free, living, mushroom, corals, and, heliofungia, actiniformis, the, word, wrasse, comes, from, the, cornish, word, wragh, a, lenited, form, of, gwragh, meaning, an, old, woman, or, hag, via, cornish, dialect, wrath, it, is, related, to, the, welsh, gwrach, and, breton, gwrac, h, wrasses, have, protractile, mouths, usually, with, separate, jaw, teeth, that, jut, outwards, many, species, can, be, readily, recognized, by, their, thick, lips, the, inside, of, which, is, sometimes, curiously, folded, a, peculiarity, which, gave, rise, to, the, german, name, of, lip, fishes, lippfische, and, the, dutch, name, of, lipvissen, the, dorsal, fin, has, eight, to, 21, spines, and, six, to, 21, soft, rays, usually, running, most, of, the, length, of, the, back, wrasses, are, sexually, dimorphic, many, species, are, capable, of, changing, sex, juveniles, are, a, mix, of, males, and, females, known, as, initial, phase, individuals, but, the, largest, adults, become, territory, holding, terminal, phase, males, the, wrasses, have, become, a, primary, study, species, in, fish, feeding, biomechanics, due, to, their, jaw, structures, the, nasal, and, mandibular, bones, are, connected, at, their, posterior, ends, to, the, rigid, neurocranium, and, the, superior, and, inferior, articulations, of, the, maxilla, are, joined, to, the, anterior, tips, of, these, two, bones, respectively, creating, a, loop, of, four, rigid, bones, connected, by, moving, joints, this, four, bar, linkage, has, the, property, of, allowing, numerous, arrangements, to, achieve, a, given, mechanical, result, fast, jaw, protrusion, or, a, forceful, bite, thus, decoupling, morphology, from, function, the, actual, morphology, of, wrasses, reflects, this, with, many, lineages, displaying, different, jaw, morphology, that, results, in, the, same, functional, output, in, a, similar, or, identical, ecological, niche, most, wrasses, inhabit, the, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, of, the, atlantic, indian, and, pacific, oceans, though, some, species, live, in, temperate, waters, the, ballan, wrasse, is, found, as, far, north, as, norway, wrasses, are, usually, found, in, shallow, water, habitats, such, as, coral, reefs, and, rocky, shores, where, they, live, close, to, the, substrate, most, labrids, are, protogynous, hermaphrodites, within, a, haremic, mating, system, a, good, example, of, this, reproductive, behavior, is, seen, in, the, california, sheephead, hermaphroditism, allows, for, complex, mating, systems, labroids, exhibit, three, different, mating, systems, polygynous, lek, like, and, promiscuous, group, spawning, and, pair, spawning, occur, within, mating, systems, the, type, of, spawning, that, occurs, depends, on, male, body, size, labroids, typically, exhibit, broadcast, spawning, releasing, high, numbers, of, planktonic, eggs, which, are, broadcast, by, tidal, currents, adult, labroids, have, no, interaction, with, offspring, wrasses, of, a, particular, subgroup, of, the, family, labridae, labrini, do, not, exhibit, broadcast, spawning, sex, change, in, wrasses, is, generally, female, to, male, but, experimental, conditions, have, allowed, for, male, to, female, sex, change, placing, two, male, labroides, dimidiatus, wrasses, in, the, same, tank, results, in, the, smaller, of, the, two, becoming, female, again, additionally, while, the, individual, to, change, sex, is, generally, the, largest, female, evidence, also, exists, of, the, largest, female, instead, choosing, to, remain, female, in, situations, in, which, she, can, maximize, her, evolutionary, fitness, by, refraining, from, changing, sex, the, subgroup, labrini, arose, from, a, basal, split, within, family, labridae, during, the, eocene, period, subgroup, labrini, is, composed, of, eight, genera, wherein, 15, of, 23, species, exhibit, broodcare, behavior, which, ranges, from, simple, to, complex, parental, care, of, spawn, males, build, algae, nests, or, crude, cavities, ventilate, eggs, and, defend, nests, against, conspecific, males, and, predators, in, species, that, express, this, behavior, eggs, cannot, survive, without, parental, care, species, of, symphodus, centrolabrus, and, labrus, genera, exhibit, broodcare, behavior, cleaner, wrasses, are, the, best, known, of, the, cleaner, fish, they, live, in, a, cleaning, symbiosis, with, larger, often, predatory, fish, grooming, them, and, benefiting, by, consuming, what, they, remove, client, fish, congregate, at, wrasse, cleaning, stations, and, wait, for, the, cleaner, fish, to, remove, gnathiid, parasites, the, cleaners, even, swimming, into, their, open, mouths, and, gill, cavities, to, do, so, cleaner, wrasses, are, best, known, for, feeding, on, dead, tissue, scales, and, ectoparasites, although, they, are, also, known, to, cheat, consuming, healthy, tissue, and, mucus, which, is, energetically, costly, for, the, client, fish, to, produce, the, bluestreak, cleaner, wrasse, labroides, dimidiatus, is, one, of, the, most, common, cleaners, found, on, tropical, reefs, few, cleaner, wrasses, have, been, observed, being, eaten, by, predators, possibly, because, parasite, removal, is, more, important, for, predator, survival, than, the, short, term, gain, of, eating, the, cleaner, in, a, 2019, study, cleaner, wrasses, passed, the, mirror, test, the, first, fish, to, do, so, however, the, test, s, inventor, american, psychologist, gordon, g, gallup, has, said, that, the, fish, were, most, likely, trying, to, scrape, off, a, perceived, parasite, on, another, fish, and, that, they, did, not, demonstrate, self, recognition, the, authors, of, the, study, retorted, that, because, the, fish, checked, themselves, in, the, mirror, before, and, after, the, scraping, this, meant, that, the, fish, had, self, awareness, and, recognized, that, their, reflections, belonged, to, their, own, bodies, in, a, 2024, study, mirror, naive, bluestreak, cleaner, wrasse, were, reported, to, initially, show, aggression, to, wrasse, photographs, sized, 10, larger, or, 10, smaller, than, themselves, regardless, of, size, however, upon, viewing, their, reflections, in, a, mirror, they, avoided, confronting, photographs, 10, larger, than, they, were, studies, show, that, some, wrasse, species, are, capable, of, tool, use, using, rocks, to, smash, open, sea, urchins, in, the, western, atlantic, coastal, region, of, north, america, the, most, common, food, species, for, indigenous, humans, was, the, tautog, a, species, of, wrasse, wrasses, today, are, commonly, found, in, both, public, and, home, aquaria, some, species, are, small, enough, to, be, considered, reef, safe, they, may, also, be, employed, as, cleaner, fish, to, combat, sea, lice, infestations, in, salmon, farms, commercial, fish, farming, of, cleaner, wrasse, for, sea, lice, pest, control, in, commercial, salmon, farming, has, developed, in, scotland, as, lice, busters, with, apparent, commercial, benefit, and, viability, as, all, fish, labrids, are, the, hosts, of, a, number, of, parasites, a, list, of, 338, parasite, taxa, from, 127, labrid, fish, species, was, provided, by, mu, oz, and, diaz, in, 2015, an, example, is, the, nematode, huffmanela, ossicola
