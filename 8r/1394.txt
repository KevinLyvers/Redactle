coronaviruses, are, a, group, of, related, rna, viruses, that, cause, diseases, in, mammals, and, birds, in, humans, and, birds, they, cause, respiratory, tract, infections, that, can, range, from, mild, to, lethal, mild, illnesses, in, humans, include, some, cases, of, the, common, cold, which, is, also, caused, by, other, viruses, predominantly, rhinoviruses, while, more, lethal, varieties, can, cause, sars, mers, and, covid, 19, in, cows, and, pigs, they, cause, diarrhea, while, in, mice, they, cause, hepatitis, and, encephalomyelitis, coronaviruses, constitute, the, subfamily, orthocoronavirinae, in, the, family, coronaviridae, order, nidovirales, and, realm, riboviria, they, are, enveloped, viruses, with, a, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, genome, and, a, nucleocapsid, of, helical, symmetry, the, genome, size, of, coronaviruses, ranges, from, approximately, 26, to, 32, kilobases, one, of, the, largest, among, rna, viruses, they, have, characteristic, club, shaped, spikes, that, project, from, their, surface, which, in, electron, micrographs, create, an, image, reminiscent, of, the, stellar, corona, from, which, their, name, derives, the, name, coronavirus, is, derived, from, latin, corona, meaning, crown, or, wreath, itself, a, borrowing, from, greek, kor, n, garland, wreath, the, name, was, coined, by, june, almeida, and, david, tyrrell, who, first, observed, and, studied, human, coronaviruses, the, word, was, first, used, in, print, in, 1968, by, an, informal, group, of, virologists, in, the, journal, nature, to, designate, the, new, family, of, viruses, the, name, refers, to, the, characteristic, appearance, of, virions, the, infective, form, of, the, virus, by, electron, microscopy, which, have, a, fringe, of, large, bulbous, surface, projections, creating, an, image, reminiscent, of, the, solar, corona, or, halo, this, morphology, is, created, by, the, viral, spike, peplomers, which, are, proteins, on, the, surface, of, the, virus, the, scientific, name, coronavirus, was, accepted, as, a, genus, name, by, the, international, committee, for, the, nomenclature, of, viruses, later, renamed, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, viruses, in, 1971, as, the, number, of, new, species, increased, the, genus, was, split, into, four, genera, namely, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, deltacoronavirus, and, gammacoronavirus, in, 2009, the, common, name, coronavirus, is, used, to, refer, to, any, member, of, the, subfamily, orthocoronavirinae, as, of, 2020, 45, species, are, officially, recognised, the, earliest, reports, of, a, coronavirus, infection, in, animals, occurred, in, the, late, 1920s, when, an, acute, respiratory, infection, of, domesticated, chickens, emerged, in, north, america, arthur, schalk, and, m, c, hawn, in, 1931, made, the, first, detailed, report, which, described, a, new, respiratory, infection, of, chickens, in, north, dakota, the, infection, of, new, born, chicks, was, characterized, by, gasping, and, listlessness, with, high, mortality, rates, of, 40, 90, leland, david, bushnell, and, carl, alfred, brandly, isolated, the, virus, that, caused, the, infection, in, 1933, the, virus, was, then, known, as, infectious, bronchitis, virus, ibv, charles, d, hudson, and, fred, robert, beaudette, cultivated, the, virus, for, the, first, time, in, 1937, the, specimen, came, to, be, known, as, the, beaudette, strain, in, the, late, 1940s, two, more, animal, coronaviruses, jhm, that, causes, brain, disease, murine, encephalitis, and, mouse, hepatitis, virus, mhv, that, causes, hepatitis, in, mice, were, discovered, it, was, not, realized, at, the, time, that, these, three, different, viruses, were, related, human, coronaviruses, were, discovered, in, the, 1960s, using, two, different, methods, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, e, c, kendall, malcolm, bynoe, and, david, tyrrell, working, at, the, common, cold, unit, of, the, british, medical, research, council, collected, a, unique, common, cold, virus, designated, b814, in, 1961, the, virus, could, not, be, cultivated, using, standard, techniques, which, had, successfully, cultivated, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and, other, known, common, cold, viruses, in, 1965, tyrrell, and, bynoe, successfully, cultivated, the, novel, virus, by, serially, passing, it, through, organ, culture, of, human, embryonic, trachea, the, new, cultivating, method, was, introduced, to, the, lab, by, bertil, hoorn, the, isolated, virus, when, intranasally, inoculated, into, volunteers, caused, a, cold, and, was, inactivated, by, ether, which, indicated, it, had, a, lipid, envelope, dorothy, hamre, and, john, procknow, at, the, university, of, chicago, isolated, a, novel, cold, from, medical, students, in, 1962, they, isolated, and, grew, the, virus, in, kidney, tissue, culture, designating, it, 229e, the, novel, virus, caused, a, cold, in, volunteers, and, like, b814, was, inactivated, by, ether, scottish, virologist, june, almeida, at, st, thomas, hospital, in, london, collaborating, with, tyrrell, compared, the, structures, of, ibv, b814, and, 229e, in, 1967, using, electron, microscopy, the, three, viruses, were, shown, to, be, morphologically, related, by, their, general, shape, and, distinctive, club, like, spikes, a, research, group, at, the, national, institute, of, health, the, same, year, was, able, to, isolate, another, member, of, this, new, group, of, viruses, using, organ, culture, and, named, one, of, the, samples, oc43, oc, for, organ, culture, like, b814, 229e, and, ibv, the, novel, cold, virus, oc43, had, distinctive, club, like, spikes, when, observed, with, the, electron, microscope, the, ibv, like, novel, cold, viruses, were, soon, shown, to, be, also, morphologically, related, to, the, mouse, hepatitis, virus, this, new, group, of, viruses, were, named, coronaviruses, after, their, distinctive, morphological, appearance, human, coronavirus, 229e, and, human, coronavirus, oc43, continued, to, be, studied, in, subsequent, decades, the, coronavirus, strain, b814, was, lost, it, is, not, known, which, present, human, coronavirus, it, was, other, human, coronaviruses, have, since, been, identified, including, sars, cov, in, 2003, hcov, nl63, in, 2003, hcov, hku1, in, 2004, mers, cov, in, 2013, and, sars, cov, 2, in, 2019, there, have, also, been, a, large, number, of, animal, coronaviruses, identified, since, the, 1960s, coronaviruses, are, large, roughly, spherical, particles, with, unique, surface, projections, their, size, is, highly, variable, with, average, diameters, of, 80, to, 120, nm, extreme, sizes, are, known, from, 50, to, 200, nm, in, diameter, the, total, molecular, mass, is, on, average, 40, 000, kda, they, are, enclosed, in, an, envelope, embedded, with, a, number, of, protein, molecules, the, lipid, bilayer, envelope, membrane, proteins, and, nucleocapsid, protect, the, virus, when, it, is, outside, the, host, cell, the, viral, envelope, is, made, up, of, a, lipid, bilayer, in, which, the, membrane, m, envelope, e, and, spike, s, structural, proteins, are, anchored, the, molar, ratio, of, e, s, m, in, the, lipid, bilayer, is, approximately, 1, 20, 300, the, e, and, m, protein, are, the, structural, proteins, that, combined, with, the, lipid, bilayer, to, shape, the, viral, envelope, and, maintain, its, size, s, proteins, are, needed, for, interaction, with, the, host, cells, but, human, coronavirus, nl63, is, peculiar, in, that, its, m, protein, has, the, binding, site, for, the, host, cell, and, not, its, s, protein, the, diameter, of, the, envelope, is, 85, nm, the, envelope, of, the, virus, in, electron, micrographs, appears, as, a, distinct, pair, of, electron, dense, shells, shells, that, are, relatively, opaque, to, the, electron, beam, used, to, scan, the, virus, particle, the, m, protein, is, the, main, structural, protein, of, the, envelope, that, provides, the, overall, shape, and, is, a, type, iii, membrane, protein, it, consists, of, 218, to, 263, amino, acid, residues, and, forms, a, layer, 7, 8, nm, thick, it, has, three, domains, a, short, n, terminal, ectodomain, a, triple, spanning, transmembrane, domain, and, a, c, terminal, endodomain, the, c, terminal, domain, forms, a, matrix, like, lattice, that, adds, to, the, extra, thickness, of, the, envelope, different, species, can, have, either, n, or, o, linked, glycans, in, their, protein, amino, terminal, domain, the, m, protein, is, crucial, during, the, assembly,

head, of, the, spike, and, has, the, receptor, binding, domain, rbd, the, s2, subunit, forms, the, stem, which, anchors, the, spike, in, the, viral, envelope, and, on, protease, activation, enables, fusion, the, two, subunits, remain, noncovalently, linked, as, they, are, exposed, on, the, viral, surface, until, they, attach, to, the, host, cell, membrane, in, a, functionally, active, state, three, s1, are, attached, to, two, s2, subunits, the, subunit, complex, is, split, into, individual, subunits, when, the, virus, binds, and, fuses, with, the, host, cell, under, the, action, of, proteases, such, as, cathepsin, family, and, transmembrane, protease, serine, 2, tmprss2, of, the, host, cell, s1, proteins, are, the, most, critical, components, in, terms, of, infection, they, are, also, the, most, variable, components, as, they, are, responsible, for, host, cell, specificity, they, possess, two, major, domains, named, n, terminal, domain, s1, ntd, and, c, terminal, domain, s1, ctd, both, of, which, serve, as, the, receptor, binding, domains, the, ntds, recognize, and, bind, sugars, on, the, surface, of, the, host, cell, an, exception, is, the, mhv, ntd, that, binds, to, a, protein, receptor, carcinoembryonic, antigen, related, cell, adhesion, molecule, 1, ceacam1, s1, ctds, are, responsible, for, recognizing, different, protein, receptors, such, as, angiotensin,

coronavirus, is, 5, leader, utr, replicase, orf1ab, spike, s, envelope, e, membrane, m, nucleocapsid, n, 3, utr, poly, a, tail, the, open, reading, frames, 1a, and, 1b, which, occupy, the, first, two, thirds, of, the, genome, encode, the, replicase, polyprotein, pp1ab, the, replicase, polyprotein, self, cleaves, to, form, 16, nonstructural, proteins, nsp1, nsp16, the, later, reading, frames, encode, the, four, major, structural, proteins, spike, envelope, membrane, and, nucleocapsid, interspersed, between, these, reading, frames, are, the, reading, frames, for, the, accessory, proteins, the, number, of, accessory, proteins, and, their, function, is, unique, depending, on, the, specific, coronavirus, infection, begins, when, the, viral, spike, protein, attaches, to, its, complementary, host, cell, receptor, after, attachment, a, protease, of, the, host, cell, cleaves, and, activates, the, receptor, attached, spike, protein, depending, on, the, host, cell, protease, available, cleavage, and, activation, allows, the, virus, to, enter, the, host, cell, by, endocytosis, or, direct, fusion, of, the, viral, envelope, with, the, host, membrane, coronaviruses, can, enter, cells, by, either, fusing, to, their, lipid, envelope, with, the, cell, membrane, on, the, cell, surface, or, by, internalization, via, endocytosis, on, entry, into, the, host, cell, the, virus, particle, is, uncoated, and, its, genome, enters, the, cell, cytoplasm, the, coronavirus, rna, genome, has, a, 5, methylated, cap, and, a, 3, polyadenylated, tail, which, allows, it, to, act, like, a, messenger, rna, and, be, directly, translated, by, the, host, cell, s, ribosomes, the, host, ribosomes, translate, the, initial, overlapping, open, reading, frames, orf1a, and, orf1b, of, the, virus, genome, into, two, large, overlapping, polyproteins, pp1a, and, pp1ab, the, larger, polyprotein, pp1ab, is, a, result, of, a, 1, ribosomal, frameshift, caused, by, a, slippery, sequence, uuuaaac, and, a, downstream, rna, pseudoknot, at, the, end, of, open, reading, frame, orf1a, the, ribosomal, frameshift, allows, for, the, continuous, translation, of, orf1a, followed, by, orf1b, the, polyproteins, have, their, own, proteases, plpro, nsp3, and, 3clpro, nsp5, which, cleave, the, polyproteins, at, different, specific, sites, the, cleavage, of, polyprotein, pp1ab, yields, 16, nonstructural, proteins, nsp1, to, nsp16, product, proteins, include, various, replication, proteins, such, as, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, nsp12, rna, helicase, nsp13, and, exoribonuclease, nsp14, a, number, of, the, nonstructural, proteins, coalesce, to, form, a, multi, protein, replicase, transcriptase, complex, rtc, the, main, replicase, transcriptase, protein, is, the, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, rdrp, it, is, directly, involved, in, the, replication, and, transcription, of, rna, from, an, rna, strand, the, other, nonstructural, proteins, in, the, complex, assist, in, the, replication, and, transcription, process, the, exoribonuclease, nonstructural, protein, for, instance, provides, extra, fidelity, to, replication, by, providing, a, proofreading, function, which, the, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, lacks, replication, one, of, the, main, functions, of, the, complex, is, to, replicate, the, viral, genome, rdrp, directly, mediates, the, synthesis, of, negative, sense, genomic, rna, from, the, positive, sense, genomic, rna, this, is, followed, by, the, replication, of, positive, sense, genomic, rna, from, the, negative, sense, genomic, rna, transcription, the, other, important, function, of, the, complex, is, to, transcribe, the, viral, genome, rdrp, directly, mediates, the, synthesis, of, negative, sense, subgenomic, rna, molecules, from, the, positive, sense, genomic, rna, this, process, is, followed, by, the, transcription, of, these, negative, sense, subgenomic, rna, molecules, to, their, corresponding, positive, sense, mrnas, the, subgenomic, mrnas, form, a, nested, set, which, have, a, common, 5, head, and, partially, duplicate, 3, end, recombination, the, replicase, transcriptase, complex, is, also, capable, of, genetic, recombination, when, at, least, two, viral, genomes, are, present, in, the, same, infected, cell, rna, recombination, appears, to, be, a, major, driving, force, in, determining, genetic, variability, within, a, coronavirus, species, the, capability, of, a, coronavirus, species, to, jump, from, one, host, to, another, and, infrequently, in, determining, the, emergence, of, novel, coronaviruses, the, exact, mechanism, of, recombination, in, coronaviruses, is, unclear, but, likely, involves, template, switching, during, genome, replication, the, replicated, positive, sense, genomic, rna, becomes, the, genome, of, the, progeny, viruses, the, mrnas, are, gene, transcripts, of, the, last, third, of, the, virus, genome, after, the, initial, overlapping, reading, frame, these, mrnas, are, translated, by, the, host, s, ribosomes, into, the, structural, proteins, and, many, accessory, proteins, rna, translation, occurs, inside, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, viral, structural, proteins, s, e, and, m, move, along, the, secretory, pathway, into, the, golgi, intermediate, compartment, there, the, m, proteins, direct, most, protein, protein, interactions, required, for, the, assembly, of, viruses, following, its, binding, to, the, nucleocapsid, progeny, viruses, are, then, released, from, the, host, cell, by, exocytosis, through, secretory, vesicles, once, released, the, viruses, can, infect, other, host, cells, infected, carriers, are, able, to, shed, viruses, into, the, environment, the, interaction, of, the, coronavirus, spike, protein, with, its, complementary, cell, receptor, is, central, in, determining, the, tissue, tropism, infectivity, and, species, range, of, the, released, virus, coronaviruses, mainly, target, epithelial, cells, they, are, transmitted, from, one, host, to, another, host, depending, on, the, coronavirus, species, by, either, an, aerosol, fomite, or, fecal, oral, route, human, coronaviruses, infect, the, epithelial, cells, of, the, respiratory, tract, while, animal, coronaviruses, generally, infect, the, epithelial, cells, of, the, digestive, tract, sars, coronavirus, for, example, infects, the, human, epithelial, cells, of, the, lungs, via, an, aerosol, route, by, binding, to, the, angiotensin, converting, enzyme, 2, ace2, receptor, transmissible, gastroenteritis, coronavirus, tgev, infects, the, pig, epithelial, cells, of, the, digestive, tract, via, a, fecal, oral, route, by, binding, to, the, alanine, aminopeptidase, apn, receptor, coronaviruses, form, the, subfamily, orthocoronavirinae, which, is, one, of, two, subfamilies, in, the, family, coronaviridae, order, nidovirales, and, realm, riboviria, they, are, divided, into, the, four, genera, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and, deltacoronavirus, alphacoronaviruses, and, betacoronaviruses, infect, mammals, while, gammacoronaviruses, and, deltacoronaviruses, primarily, infect, birds, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, mrca, of, all, coronaviruses, is, estimated, to, have, existed, as, recently, as, 8000, bce, although, some, models, place, the, common, ancestor, as, far, back, as, 55, million, years, or, more, implying, long, term, coevolution, with, bat, and, avian, species, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, the, alphacoronavirus, line, has, been, placed, at, about, 2400, bce, of, the, betacoronavirus, line, at, 3300, bce, of, the, gammacoronavirus, line, at, 2800, bce, and, the, deltacoronavirus, line, at, about, 3000, bce, bats, and, birds, as, warm, blooded, flying, vertebrates, are, an, ideal, natural, reservoir, for, the, coronavirus, gene, pool, with, bats, the, reservoir, for, alphacoronaviruses, and, betacoronavirus, and, birds, the, reservoir, for, gammacoronaviruses, and, deltacoronaviruses, the, large, number, and, global, range, of, bat, and, avian, species, that, host, viruses, have, enabled, extensive, evolution, and, dissemination, of, coronaviruses, many, human, coronaviruses, have, their, origin, in, bats, the, human, coronavirus, nl63, shared, a, common, ancestor, with, a, bat, coronavirus, arcov, 2, between, 1190, and, 1449, ce, the, human, coronavirus, 229e, shared, a, common, ancestor, with, a, bat, coronavirus, ghanagrp1, bt, cov, between, 1686, and, 1800, ce, more, recently, alpaca, coronavirus, and, human, coronavirus, 229e, diverged, sometime, before, 1960, mers, cov, emerged, in, humans, from, bats, through, the, intermediate, host, of, camels, mers, cov, although, related, to, several, bat, coronavirus, species, appears, to, have, diverged, from, these, several, centuries, ago, the, most, closely, related, bat, coronavirus, and, sars, cov, diverged, in, 1986, the, ancestors, of, sars, cov, first, infected, leaf, nose, bats, of, the, genus, hipposideridae, subsequently, they, spread, to, horseshoe, bats, in, the, species, rhinolophidae, then, to, asian, palm, civets, and, finally, to, humans, unlike, other, betacoronaviruses, bovine, coronavirus, of, the, species, betacoronavirus, 1, and, subgenus, embecovirus, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, rodents, and, not, in, bats, in, the, 1790s, equine, coronavirus, diverged, from, the, bovine, coronavirus, after, a, cross, species, jump, later, in, the, 1890s, human, coronavirus, oc43, diverged, from, bovine, coronavirus, after, another, cross, species, spillover, event, it, is, speculated, that, the, flu, pandemic, of, 1890, may, have, been, caused, by, this, spillover, event, and, not, by, the, influenza, virus, because, of, the, related, timing, neurological, symptoms, and, unknown, causative, agent, of, the, pandemic, besides, causing, respiratory, infections, human, coronavirus, oc43, is, also, suspected, of, playing, a, role, in, neurological, diseases, in, the, 1950s, the, human, coronavirus, oc43, began, to, diverge, into, its, present, genotypes, phylogenetically, mouse, hepatitis, virus, murine, coronavirus, which, infects, the, mouse, s, liver, and, central, nervous, system, is, related, to, human, coronavirus, oc43, and, bovine, coronavirus, human, coronavirus, hku1, like, the, aforementioned, viruses, also, has, its, origins, in, rodents, coronaviruses, vary, significantly, in, risk, factor, some, can, kill, more, than, 30, of, those, infected, such, as, mers, cov, and, some, are, relatively, harmless, such, as, the, common, cold, coronaviruses, can, cause, colds, with, major, symptoms, such, as, fever, and, a, sore, throat, from, swollen, adenoids, coronaviruses, can, cause, pneumonia, either, direct, viral, pneumonia, or, secondary, bacterial, pneumonia, and, bronchitis, either, direct, viral, bronchitis, or, secondary, bacterial, bronchitis, the, human, coronavirus, discovered, in, 2003, sars, cov, which, causes, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, sars, has, a, unique, pathogenesis, because, it, causes, both, upper, and, lower, respiratory, tract, infections, six, species, of, human, coronaviruses, are, known, with, one, species, subdivided, into, two, different, strains, making, seven, strains, of, human, coronaviruses, altogether, four, human, coronaviruses, produce, symptoms, that, are, generally, mild, even, though, it, is, contended, they, might, have, been, more, aggressive, in, the, past, three, human, coronaviruses, produce, potentially, severe, symptoms, these, cause, the, diseases, commonly, called, sars, mers, and, covid, 19, respectively, although, the, common, cold, is, usually, caused, by, rhinoviruses, in, about, 15, of, cases, the, cause, is, a, coronavirus, the, human, coronaviruses, hcov, oc43, hcov, hku1, hcov, 229e, and, hcov, nl63, continually, circulate, in, the, human, population, in, adults, and, children, worldwide, and, produce, the, generally, mild, symptoms, of, the, common, cold, the, four, mild, coronaviruses, have, a, seasonal, incidence, occurring, in, the, winter, months, in, temperate, climates, there, is, no, preponderance, in, any, season, in, tropical, climates, in, 2003, following, the, outbreak, of, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, sars, which, had, begun, the, prior, year, in, asia, and,

genetic, similarity, to, the, sars, cov, the, virus, has, a, 96, similarity, to, a, bat, coronavirus, so, it, is, widely, suspected, to, originate, from, bats, as, well, during, a, surveillance, study, of, archived, samples, of, malaysian, viral, pneumonia, patients, virologists, identified, a, strain, of, canine, coronavirus, which, has, infected, humans, in, 2018, coronaviruses, have, been, recognized, as, causing, pathological, conditions, in, veterinary, medicine, since, the, 1930s, they, infect, a, range, of, animals, including, swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds, and, bats, the, majority, of, animal, related, coronaviruses, infect, the, intestinal, tract, and, are, transmitted, by, a, fecal, oral, route, significant, research, efforts, have, been, focused, on, elucidating, the, viral, pathogenesis, of, these, animal, coronaviruses, especially, by, virologists, interested, in, veterinary, and, zoonotic, diseases, coronaviruses, infect, domesticated, birds, infectious, bronchitis, virus, ibv, a, type, of, coronavirus, causes, avian, infectious, bronchitis, the, virus, is, of, concern, to, the, poultry, industry, because, of, the, high, mortality, from, infection, its, rapid, spread, and, its, effect, on, production, the, virus, affects, both, meat, production, and, egg, production, and, causes, substantial, economic, loss, in, chickens, infectious, bronchitis, virus, targets, not, only, the, respiratory, tract, but, also, the, urogenital, tract, the, virus, can, spread, to, different, organs, throughout, the, chicken, the, virus, is, transmitted, by, aerosol, and, food, contaminated, by, feces, different, vaccines, against, ibv, exist, and, have, helped, to, limit, the, spread, of, the, virus, and, its, variants, infectious, bronchitis, virus, is, one, of, a, number, of, strains, of, the, species, avian, coronavirus, another, strain, of, avian, coronavirus, is, turkey, coronavirus, tcv, which, causes, enteritis, in, turkeys, coronaviruses, also, affect, other, branches, of, animal, husbandry, such, as, pig, farming, and, cattle, raising, swine, acute, diarrhea, syndrome, coronavirus, sads, cov, which, is, related, to, bat, coronavirus, hku2, causes, diarrhea, in, pigs, porcine, epidemic, diarrhea, virus, pedv, is, a, coronavirus, that, has, recently, emerged, and, similarly, causes, diarrhea, in, pigs, transmissible, gastroenteritis, virus, tgev, which, is, a, member, of, the, species, alphacoronavirus, 1, is, another, coronavirus, that, causes, diarrhea, in, young, pigs, in, the, cattle, industry, bovine, coronavirus, bcv, which, is, a, member, of, the, species, betacoronavirus, 1, and, related, to, hcov, oc43, is, responsible, for, severe, profuse, enteritis, in, young, calves, coronaviruses, infect, domestic, pets, such, as, cats, dogs, and, ferrets, there, are, two, forms, of, feline, coronavirus, which, are, both, members, of, the, species, alphacoronavirus, 1, feline, enteric, coronavirus, is, a, pathogen, of, minor, clinical, significance, but, spontaneous, mutation, of, this, virus, can, result, in, feline, infectious, peritonitis, fip, a, disease, with, high, mortality, there, are, two, different, coronaviruses, that, infect, dogs, canine, coronavirus, ccov, which, is, a, member, of, the, species, alphacoronavirus, 1, causes, mild, gastrointestinal, disease, canine, respiratory, coronavirus, crcov, which, is, a, member, of, the, species, betacoronavirus, 1, and, related, to, hcov, oc43, cause, respiratory, disease, similarly, there, are, two, types, of, coronavirus, that, infect, ferrets, ferret, enteric, coronavirus, causes, a, gastrointestinal, syndrome, known, as, epizootic, catarrhal, enteritis, ece, and, a, more, lethal, systemic, version, of, the, virus, like, fip, in, cats, known, as, ferret, systemic, coronavirus, fsc, coronaviruses, infect, laboratory, animals, mouse, hepatitis, virus, mhv, which, is, a, member, of, the, species, murine, coronavirus, causes, an, epidemic, murine, illness, with, high, mortality, especially, among, colonies, of, laboratory, mice, prior, to, the, discovery, of, sars, cov, mhv, was, the, best, studied, coronavirus, both, in, vivo, and, in, vitro, as, well, as, at, the, molecular, level, some, strains, of, mhv, cause, a, progressive, demyelinating, encephalitis, in, mice, which, has, been, used, as, a, murine, model, for, multiple, sclerosis, sialodacryoadenitis, virus, sdav, which, is, a, strain, of, the, species, murine, coronavirus, is, highly, infectious, coronavirus, of, laboratory, rats, which, can, be, transmitted, between, individuals, by, direct, contact, and, indirectly, by, aerosol, rabbit, enteric, coronavirus, causes, acute, gastrointestinal, disease, and, diarrhea, in, young, european, rabbits, mortality, rates, are, high, a, number, of, vaccines, using, different, methods, have, been, developed, against, human, coronavirus, sars, cov, 2, antiviral, targets, against, human, coronaviruses, have, also, been, identified, such, as, viral, proteases, polymerases, and, entry, proteins, drugs, are, in, development, which, target, these, proteins, and, the, different, steps, of, viral, replication, vaccines, are, available, for, animal, coronaviruses, ibv, tgev, and, canine, cov, although, their, effectiveness, is, limited, in, the, case, of, outbreaks, of, highly, contagious, animal, coronaviruses, such, as, pedv, measures, such, as, destruction, of, entire, herds, of, pigs, may, be, used, to, prevent, transmission, to, other, herds
