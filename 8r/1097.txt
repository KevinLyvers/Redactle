a, lima, bean, phaseolus, lunatus, also, commonly, known, as, butter, bean, sieva, bean, double, bean, or, madagascar, bean, is, a, legume, grown, for, its, edible, seeds, or, beans, phaseolus, lunatus, is, found, in, meso, and, south, america, two, gene, pools, of, cultivated, lima, beans, point, to, independent, domestication, events, the, mesoamerican, lima, bean, is, distributed, in, neotropical, lowlands, while, the, other, is, found, in, the, western, andes, they, were, discovered, in, peru, and, may, have, been, the, first, plant, that, was, brought, up, under, civilization, by, the, native, farmers, the, andes, domestication, took, place, around, 2000, bc, and, produced, a, large, seeded, variety, lima, type, while, the, second, taking, place, in, mesoamerica, around, 800, ad, produced, a, small, seeded, variety, sieva, type, by, around, 1300, cultivation, had, spread, north, of, the, rio, grande, and, in, the, 1500s, the, plant, began, to, be, cultivated, in, the, old, world, the, small, seeded, sieva, type, is, found, distributed, from, mexico, to, argentina, generally, below, 1, 600, m, 5, 200, ft, above, sea, level, while, the, large, seeded, wild, form, lima, type, is, found, distributed, in, the, north, of, peru, from, 320, to, 2, 030, m, 1, 050, to, 6, 660, ft, above, sea, level, the, moche, culture, 1, 800, ce, cultivated, lima, beans, heavily, and, often, depicted, them, in, their, art, during, the, spanish, viceroyalty, of, peru, lima, beans, were, exported, to, the, rest, of, the, americas, and, europe, and, since, the, boxes, of, such, goods, had, their, place, of, origin, labeled, lima, peru, the, beans, got, named, as, such, the, term, butter, bean, is, widely, used, in, north, and, south, carolina, for, a, large, flat, and, yellow, white, variety, of, lima, bean, p, lunatus, var, macrocarpus, or, p, limensis, in, the, united, states, sieva, type, beans, are, traditionally, called, butter, beans, also, otherwise, known, as, the, dixie, or, henderson, type, in, that, area, lima, beans, and, butter, beans, are, seen, as, two, distinct, types, of, beans, although, they, are, the, same, species, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, butter, beans, refers, to, either, dried, beans, which, can, be, purchased, to, rehydrate, or, the, canned, variety, which, are, ready, to, use, in, culinary, use, there, lima, beans, and, butter, beans, are, distinct, the, former, being, small, and, green, the, latter, large, and, yellow, in, areas, where, both, are, considered, to, be, lima, beans, the, green, variety, may, be, labeled, as, baby, and, less, commonly, junior, limas, in, spain, it, is, called, garrof, n, and, constitutes, one, of, the, main, ingredients, of, the, famous, valencian, paella, in, india, they, are, called, double, beans, dried, beans, are, soaked, overnight, and, pressure, cooked, as, ingredients, in, curries, the, lima, bean, is, a, domesticated, species, of, economic, and, cultural, importance, worldwide, especially, in, mexico, the, species, has, two, varieties, the, wild, variety, is, silvester, and, the, domesticated, one, is, lunatus, in, the, u, s, it, is, a, warm, season, crop, grown, mainly, in, delaware, and, the, mid, atlantic, region, for, processing, and, in, the, midwest, and, california, for, dry, beans, baby, lima, beans, are, planted, in, early, june, and, harvested, about, 10, 12, weeks, later, in, western, new, york, state, baby, lima, bean, production, increased, greatly, from, 2011, to, 2015, in, oaxaca, mexico, the, main, rainy, season, lasts, from, june, to, august, and, most, of, the, above, ground, parts, die, during, the, dry, season, germination, or, budding, occurs, in, june, or, july, the, first, inflorescence, is, in, october, or, november, the, production, of, flowers, and, fruits, usually, ends, between, february, and, april, both, bush, and, pole, vine, cultivars, exist, the, latter, range, from, 1, to, 5, metres, 3, ft, 3, in, to, 16, ft, 5, in, in, height, the, bush, cultivars, mature, earlier, than, the, pole, cultivars, the, pods, are, up, to, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, long, the, mature, seeds, are, 1, to, 3, cm, 0, 39, to, 1, 18, in, long, and, oval, to, kidney, shaped, in, most, cultivars, the, seeds, are, quite, flat, but, in, the, potato, cultivars, the, shape, approaches, spherical, white, seeds, are, common, but, black, red, orange, and, variously, mottled, seeds, are, also, known, the, immature, seeds, are, uniformly, green, lima, beans, typically, yield, 2, 900, to, 5, 000, kg, 6, 400, to, 11, 000, lb, of, seed, and, 3, 000, to, 8, 000, kg, 6, 600, to, 17, 600, lb, of, biomass, per, hectare, the, seeds, of, the, cultivars, listed, below, are, white, unless, otherwise, noted, closely, related, or, synonymous, names, are, listed, on, the, same, line, phytophthora, phaseoli, is, one, example, of, a, pathogen, of, the, lima, bean, it, is, an, oomycete, plant, pathogen, that, causes, downy, mildew, of, lima, bean, during, cool, and, humid, weather, conditions, to, combat, this, pathogen, developing, lima, bean, cultivars, with, resistance, is, a, relatively, cost, efficient, method, that, is, also, environmentally, safe, as, compared, to, using, pesticides, didymella, is, a, foliar, disease, found, in, baby, lima, beans, first, reported, in, new, york, state, symptoms, include, small, necrotic, tan, spots, with, red, to, reddish, brown, irregular, margins, that, come, together, to, eventually, cover, the, entire, leaf, lesions, occur, after, around, 3, 4, weeks, of, planting, and, increase, until, there, is, considerable, defoliation, lesions, are, usually, observed, on, the, stems, two, pycnidial, fungi, were, found, on, leaves, including, didymella, sp, and, boeremia, exigua, var, exigua, which, is, pathogenic, on, baby, lima, bean, and, plays, a, role, in, the, foliar, disease, complex, other, fungal, diseases, on, lima, beans, with, similar, symptoms, are, b, exigua, var, exigua, pod, blight, caused, by, diaporthe, phaseolorum, and, leaf, spots, caused, by, phyllosticta, sp, and, phoma, subcircinata, the, two, spotted, spider, mites, or, tetranychus, urticae, lay, eggs, on, lima, bean, leaves, it, prefers, lima, bean, plants, as, a, host, food, source, over, other, plants, such, as, tomato, or, cabbage, plants, spider, mites, pose, the, greatest, threat, to, lima, bean, plants, compared, to, other, species, such, as, the, common, cutworm, spodoptera, litura, which, is, also, known, to, feed, on, lima, bean, plants, these, plants, are, host, plants, for, their, larvae, one, herbivore, of, lima, bean, is, spodoptera, littoralis, the, african, cotton, leafworm, an, attack, by, this, herbivore, induces, hydrogen, peroxide, in, the, leaves, this, may, also, be, advantageous, to, defend, against, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, fungi, or, viruses, as, they, can, easily, invade, herbivore, infected, leaves, other, predatory, insects, include, ants, wasps, flies, and, beetles, lima, beans, use, extrafloral, nectar, efn, secretion, when, exposed, to, volatiles, from, other, plants, infested, by, herbivore, species, producing, efn, can, be, an, indirect, defense, since, it, supplies, enemies, of, herbivores, with, an, alternative, food, source, the, predator, of, lima, beans, spider, mites, also, have, their, own, predators, the, carnivorous, mite, phytoseiulus, persimilis, these, predatory, mites, use, efn, as, an, alternative, food, source, and, thus, the, production, of, this, by, the, lima, bean, can, attract, p, persimilis, and, thus, deter, their, herbivore, hosts, the, main, induced, defense, of, the, lima, bean, is, the, jasmonic, acid, pathway, jasmonic, acid, induces, the, production, of, extrafloral, nectar, flow, or, induces, it, when, herbivory, occurs, such, as, when, attacked, by, spider, mites, one, direct, chemical, defense, involves, cyanogenesis, which, is, the, release, of, hydrogen, cyanide, when, the, cell, senses, damage, cyanide, acts, as, a, repellent, on, the, leaves, of, lima, beans, phaseolus, lunatus, has, adapted, to, live, in, many, different, climates, around, the, world, one, of, these, adaptations, includes, a, particularly, effective, induced, herbivory, defense, the, lima, bean, is, able, to, signal, to, the, carnivorous, natural, enemy, of, herbivores, the, carnivorous, mite, mediated, by, hipvs, herbivore, induced, plant, volatiles, in, an, attempt, to, save, itself, from, further, predation, the, lima, bean, plant, does, this, as, an, induced, defense, when, being, eaten, by, herbivorous, predators, it, is, the, mechanical, wounding, and, chemical, elicitors, from, insect, oral, secretions, that, first, begin, the, signaling, pathway, to, induce, hipv, production, once, this, pathway, is, induced, the, plant, produces, hipvs, which, are, released, into, the, air, and, can, be, received, by, any, organisms, that, have, receptors, capable, of, receiving, hipvs, which, includes, carnivores, conspecific, and, heterospecific, herbivores, as, well, as, neighboring, plants, it, is, this, signaling, of, the, carnivorous, natural, enemy, of, herbivores, that, is, of, particular, interest, as, they, become, attracted, to, the, plant, and, will, then, come, and, prey, upon, the, plant, s, herbivorous, enemy, thereby, reducing, herbivory, of, the, plant, one, particular, experiment, in, which, this, was, made, apparent, was, in, the, understanding, of, the, tritrophic, system, between, the, lima, bean, plant, two, spotted, spider, mite, and, the, carnivorous, mite, here, experimenters, noticed, an, increase, in, hipvs, when, the, lima, bean, plant, was, preyed, on, by, the, two, spotted, spider, mite, then, when, the, carnivorous, mite, was, introduced, it, had, increased, prey, searching, efficacy, and, overall, attraction, to, the, lima, bean, plant, even, once, the, two, spotted, spider, mite, was, removed, but, the, hipvs, remained, high, like, many, beans, raw, lima, beans, are, toxic, containing, e, g, phytohaemagglutinin, if, not, boiled, for, at, least, 10, minutes, canned, beans, can, be, eaten, without, having, to, be, boiled, first, as, they, are, pre, cooked, the, lima, bean, can, contain, anti, nutrients, like, phytic, acids, saponin, oxalate, tannin, and, trypsin, inhibitor, these, inhibit, the, absorption, of, nutrients, in, animals, and, can, cause, damage, to, some, organs, in, addition, to, boiling, methods, of, roasting, pressure, cooking, soaking, and, germination, can, also, reduce, the, antinutrients, significantly, the, most, abundant, mineral, in, the, raw, lima, bean, is, potassium, followed, by, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, and, iron, when, lima, beans, germinate, there, is, increased, bioavailability, of, calcium, and, phosphorus, additionally, it, is, a, good, source, of, vitamin, b, 6, like, many, other, legumes, lima, beans, are, a, good, source, of, dietary, fiber, and, a, virtually, fat, free, source, of, high, quality, protein, lima, beans, contain, both, soluble, fiber, which, helps, regulate, blood, sugar, levels, and, lowers, cholesterol, and, insoluble, fiber, which, aids, in, the, prevention, of, constipation, digestive, disorders, irritable, bowel, syndrome, and, diverticulitis, the, high, fiber, content, in, lima, beans, prevents, blood, sugar, levels, from, rising, too, rapidly, after, eating, them, due, to, the, presence, of, those, large, amounts, of, absorption, slowing, compounds, in, the, beans, and, the, high, soluble, fiber, content, soluble, fiber, absorbs, water, in, the, stomach, forming, a, gel, that, slows, down, the, absorption, of, the, bean, s, carbohydrates, they, can, therefore, help, balance, blood, sugar, levels, while, providing, steady, slow, burning, energy, which, makes, them, a, good, choice, for, people, with, diabetes, suffering, from, insulin, resistance
