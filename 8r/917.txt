mountains, throughout, much, of, north, and, central, america, europe, asia, and, north, africa, the, genus, is, most, closely, related, to, cedrus, cedar, the, genus, name, is, derived, from, the, latin, to, rise, in, reference, to, the, height, of, its, species, the, common, english, name, originates, with, the, old, norse, fyri, or, the, old, danish, fyr, they, are, large, trees, reaching, heights, of, 10, 80, metres, 33, 262, feet, tall, with, trunk, diameters, of, 0, 5, 4, m, 1, ft, 8, in, 13, ft, 1, in, when, mature, firs, can, be, distinguished, from, other, members, of, the, pine, family, by, the, way, in, which, their, needle, like, leaves, are, attached, singly, to, the, branches, with, a, base, resembling, a, suction, cup, and, by, their, cones, which, like, those, of, true, cedars, stand, upright, on, the, branches, like, candles, and, disintegrate, at, maturity, identification, of, the, different, species, is, based, on, the, size, and, arrangement, of, the, leaves, the, size, and, shape, of, the, cones, and, whether, the, bract, scales, of, the, cones, are, long, and, exserted, or, short, and, hidden, inside, the, cone, firs, can, be, distinguished, from, other, members, of, the, pine, family, by, the, unique, attachment, of, their, needle, like, leaves, to, the, twig, by, a, base, that, resembles, a, small, suction, cup, the, leaves, are, significantly, flattened, sometimes, even, looking, like, they, are, pressed, as, in, a, sibirica, the, leaves, have, two, whitish, lines, on, the, bottom, each, of, which, is, formed, by, wax, covered, stomatal, bands, in, most, species, the, upper, surface, of, the, leaves, is, uniformly, green, and, shiny, without, stomata, or, with, a, few, on, the, tip, visible, as, whitish, spots, other, species, have, the, upper, surface, of, leaves, dull, gray, green, or, bluish, gray, to, silvery, glaucous, coated, by, wax, with, variable, number, of, stomatal, bands, and, not, always, continuous, an, example, species, with, shiny, green, leaves, is, a, alba, and, an, example, species, with, dull, waxy, leaves, is, a, concolor, the, tips, of, leaves, are, usually, more, or, less, notched, as, in, a, firma, but, sometimes, rounded, or, dull, as, in, a, concolor, a, magnifica, or, sharp, and, prickly, as, in, a, bracteata, a, cephalonica, a, holophylla, the, leaves, of, young, plants, are, usually, sharper, the, way, they, spread, from, the, shoot, is, very, diverse, only, in, some, species, comb, shaped, with, the, leaves, arranged, on, two, sides, flat, a, alba, the, upper, foliage, is, different, on, cone, bearing, branches, with, the, leaves, short, curved, and, sharp, firs, differ, from, other, conifers, in, having, erect, cylindrical, cones, 5, 25, cm, 2, 10, in, long, that, disintegrate, at, maturity, to, release, the, winged, seeds, in, contrast, to, spruces, fir, cones, do, not, hang, even, large, fir, cones, grow, upwards, like, candles, the, new, growth, of, the, tree, mature, cones, are, usually, brown, young, in, summer, can, be, green, for, example, or, purple, and, blue, sometimes, very, dark, abies, produce, a, variety, of, terpenoids, the, analyses, of, the, zavarin, group, from, smedman, et, al, 1969, to, zavarin, et, al, 1977, showed, variation, in, terpenoid, composition, of, the, bark, by, genetics, geography, age, and, size, of, the, tree, the, oldest, pollen, assignable, to, the, genus, dates, to, the, late, cretaceous, in, siberia, with, records, of, leaves, and, reproductive, organs, across, the, northern, hemisphere, from, the, eocene,
