see, text, the, family, campanulaceae, also, bellflower, family, of, the, order, asterales, contains, nearly, 2400, species, in, 84, genera, of, herbaceous, plants, shrubs, and, rarely, small, trees, often, with, milky, sap, among, them, are, several, familiar, garden, plants, belonging, to, the, genera, campanula, bellflower, lobelia, and, platycodon, balloonflower, campanula, rapunculus, rampion, or, r, bellflower, and, codonopsis, lanceolata, are, eaten, as, vegetables, lobelia, inflata, indian, tobacco, l, siphilitica, and, l, tupa, devil, s, tobacco, and, others, have, been, used, as, medicinal, plants, campanula, rapunculoides, creeping, bellflower, may, be, a, troublesome, weed, particularly, in, gardens, while, legousia, spp, may, occur, in, arable, fields, most, current, classifications, include, the, segregate, family, lobeliaceae, in, campanulaceae, as, subfamily, lobelioideae, a, third, subfamily, cyphioideae, includes, the, genus, cyphia, and, sometimes, also, the, genera, cyphocarpus, nemacladus, parishella, and, pseudonemacladus, alternatively, the, last, three, genera, are, placed, in, nemacladoideae, while, cyphocarpus, is, placed, in, its, own, subfamily, cyphocarpoideae, this, family, is, almost, cosmopolitan, occurring, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, in, addition, species, of, the, family, are, native, to, many, remote, oceanic, islands, and, archipelagos, hawaii, is, particularly, rich, with, well, over, 100, endemic, species, of, hawaiian, lobelioids, continental, areas, with, high, diversity, are, south, africa, california, and, the, northern, andes, habitats, range, from, extreme, deserts, to, rainforests, and, lakes, from, the, tropics, to, the, high, arctic, campanula, uniflora, and, from, sea, cliffs, to, high, alpine, habitats, although, most, campanulaceae, are, perennial, herbs, sometimes, climbing, as, in, codonopsis, there, is, also, a, large, number, of, annuals, e, g, species, of, legousia, isotoma, hypocrateriformis, is, a, succulent, annual, from, australia, s, dry, interior, there, are, also, biennials, e, g, the, commonly, cultivated, ornamental, campanula, medium, canterbury, bells, many, perennial, campanuloids, grow, in, rock, crevices, such, as, musschia, aurea, madeira, and, petromarula, pinnata, crete, some, lobelioids, also, grow, on, rocks, e, g, the, peculiar, perennial, stem, succulent, brighamia, rockii, in, hawaii, insular, and, tropical, montane, species, in, particular, are, often, more, or, less, woody, and, may, bear, the, leaves, in, a, dense, rosette, when, in, addition, the, plant, is, unbranched, the, result, may, be, a, palm, or, treefern, like, habit, as, in, species, of, the, hawaiian, genus, cyanea, which, comprises, the, tallest, of, campanulaceae, c, leptostegia, up, to, 14, m, lysipomia, are, minute, cushion, plants, of, the, high, andes, while, gigant, rosette, forming, lobelias, e, g, lobelia, deckenii, are, a, characteristic, component, of, the, vegetation, in, the, alpine, zone, on, the, tropical, african, volcanoes, in, the, himalaya, campanula, modesta, and, cyananthus, microphyllus, reach, even, higher, probably, setting, the, altitudinal, record, for, the, family, at, 4800, m, several, species, are, associated, with, freshwater, such, as, lobelia, dortmanna, an, isoetid, common, in, oligotrophic, lakes, in, the, boreal, zone, of, north, america, and, europe, and, howellia, aquatilis, an, elodeid, growing, in, ponds, in, sw, north, america, there, is, usually, abundant, white, latex, but, occasionally, the, exudate, is, clear, and, or, very, sparse, as, in, jasione, tubers, occur, in, several, genera, e, g, cyphia, leaves, are, often, alternate, more, rarely, opposite, e, g, codonopsis, or, whorled, ostrowskia, they, are, simple, petromarula, one, of, very, few, exceptions, entire, repeatedly, divided, in, spp, of, cyanea, but, often, with, dentate, margin, stipules, are, absent, inflorescences, are, quite, diverse, including, both, cymose, and, racemose, types, in, jasione, they, are, strongly, condensed, and, resemble, asteraceous, capitula, in, a, few, species, e, g, cyananthus, lobatus, flowers, are, solitary, flowers, are, bisexual, dioecious, in, dialypetalum, and, protandrous, petals, are, fused, into, a, corolla, with, 3, to, 8, lobes, it, may, be, bell, or, star, shaped, in, subfamily, campanuloideae, while, tubular, and, bilaterally, symmetric, in, most, lobelioideae, blue, of, various, shades, is, the, most, common, petal, colour, but, purple, red, pink, orange, yellow, white, and, green, also, occur, the, corolla, may, be, down, to, 1, mm, wide, and, long, in, some, species, of, wahlenbergia, at, the, other, extreme, it, reaches, a, width, of, 15, cm, in, ostrowskia, stamens, are, equal, in, number, to, and, alternating, with, the, petals, anthers, may, be, fused, into, a, tube, as, in, all, species, of, lobelioideae, and, some, campanuloideae, e, g, symphyandra, within, the, family, pollen, grains, are, often, tricolporate, less, commonly, triporate, tricolpate, or, pantoporate, carpel, number, is, usually, 2, 3, or, 5, 8, in, ostrowskia, and, corresponds, to, the, number, of, stigmatic, lobes, the, style, is, in, various, ways, involved, in, the, presentation, of, the, pollen, as, in, several, other, families, of, the, order, asterales, in, lobelioideae, pollen, is, already, in, the, bud, stage, released, into, the, tube, formed, by, the, anthers, during, flowering, it, is, pushed, up, by, the, elongating, style, and, presented, to, visiting, pollinators, at, the, apex, of, the, tube, a, mechanism, described, as, a, pollen, pump, the, style, eventually, protrudes, through, the, anther, tube, and, becomes, receptive, to, pollen, in, campanuloideae, the, pollen, is, instead, packed, between, hairs, on, the, style, gradually, being, released, as, the, hairs, invaginate, subsequently, the, stigmatic, lobes, unfold, and, become, receptive, bees, and, birds, particularly, hummingbirds, and, hawaiian, honeycreepers, are, probably, the, most, common, pollinators, of, campanulaceae, a, few, confirmed, and, many, probable, cases, of, bat, pollination, are, known, particularly, in, the, genus, burmeistera, brighamia, and, hippobroma, have, pale, or, white, flowers, with, a, long, tubed, corolla, and, are, pollinated, by, hawkmoths, pollination, by, lizards, has, been, reported, for, musschia, aurea, and, nesocodon, mauritianus, the, ovary, is, usually, inferior, or, in, some, species, semi, inferior, very, rarely, is, it, completely, superior, e, g, cyananthus, in, campanumoea, javanica, calyx, and, corolla, diverge, from, the, ovary, at, different, levels, berries, are, a, common, fruit, type, in, lobelioideae, burmeistera, clermontia, centropogon, cyanea, etc, whilst, rare, in, campanuloideae, canarina, being, one, of, few, examples, capsules, with, very, varying, modes, of, dehiscence, are, otherwise, the, predominating, fruit, type, in, the, family, seeds, are, mostly, small, 2, mm, and, numerous, 95, genera, are, accepted, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, website, divides, the, family, into, five, subfamilies, campanuloideae, lobelioideae, cyphioideae, cyphocarpoideae, nemacladoideae, the, earliest, known, occurrence, of, campanulaceae, pollen, is, from, oligocene, strata, earliest, campanulaceae, macrofossils, dated, are, seeds, of, campanula, paleopyramidalis, from, 17, 16, million, years, old, miocene, deposits, in, the, nowy, sacz, carpathians, poland, it, is, a, close, relative, of, the, extant, campanula, pyramidalis, members, of, subfamily, lobelioideae, contain, the, alkaloid, lobeline, the, principal, storage, carbohydrate, of, campanulaceae, is, inulin, a, fructan, also, occurring, in, the, related, asteraceae
