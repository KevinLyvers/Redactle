infertility, is, the, inability, of, an, animal, or, plant, to, reproduce, by, natural, means, it, is, usually, not, the, natural, state, of, a, healthy, adult, except, notably, among, certain, eusocial, species, mostly, haplodiploid, insects, it, is, the, normal, state, of, a, human, child, or, other, young, offspring, because, they, have, not, undergone, puberty, which, is, the, body, s, start, of, reproductive, capacity, in, humans, infertility, is, the, inability, to, become, pregnant, after, one, year, of, unprotected, and, regular, sexual, intercourse, involving, a, male, and, female, partner, there, are, many, causes, of, infertility, including, some, that, medical, intervention, can, treat, estimates, from, 1997, suggest, that, worldwide, about, five, percent, of, all, heterosexual, couples, have, an, unresolved, problem, with, infertility, many, more, couples, however, experience, involuntary, childlessness, for, at, least, one, year, estimates, range, from, 12, to, 28, the, main, cause, of, infertility, in, humans, is, age, and, an, advanced, maternal, age, can, raise, the, probability, of, suffering, a, spontaneous, abortion, during, pregnancy, male, infertility, is, responsible, for, 20, 30, of, infertility, cases, while, 20, 35, are, due, to, female, infertility, and, 25, 40, are, due, to, combined, problems, in, both, parts, in, 10, 20, of, cases, no, cause, is, found, the, most, common, cause, of, female, infertility, is, age, which, generally, manifests, in, sparse, or, absent, menstrual, periods, male, infertility, is, most, commonly, due, to, deficiencies, in, the, semen, and, semen, quality, is, used, as, a, surrogate, measure, of, male, fecundity, women, who, are, fertile, experience, a, period, of, fertility, before, and, during, ovulation, and, are, infertile, for, the, rest, of, the, menstrual, cycle, fertility, awareness, methods, are, used, to, discern, when, these, changes, occur, by, tracking, changes, in, cervical, mucus, or, basal, body, temperature, demographers, tend, to, define, infertility, as, childlessness, in, a, population, of, women, of, reproductive, age, whereas, the, epidemiological, definition, refers, to, trying, for, or, time, to, a, pregnancy, generally, in, a, population, of, women, exposed, to, a, probability, of, conception, currently, female, fertility, normally, peaks, in, young, adulthood, and, diminishes, after, 35, with, pregnancy, occurring, rarely, after, age, 50, a, female, is, most, fertile, within, 24, hours, of, ovulation, male, fertility, peaks, usually, in, young, adulthood, and, declines, after, age, 40, the, time, needed, to, pass, during, which, the, couple, tries, to, conceive, for, that, couple, to, be, diagnosed, with, infertility, differs, between, different, jurisdictions, existing, definitions, of, infertility, lack, uniformity, rendering, comparisons, in, prevalence, between, countries, or, over, time, problematic, therefore, data, estimating, the, prevalence, of, infertility, cited, by, various, sources, differ, significantly, a, couple, that, tries, unsuccessfully, to, have, a, child, after, a, certain, period, of, time, often, a, short, period, but, definitions, vary, is, sometimes, said, to, be, subfertile, meaning, less, fertile, than, a, typical, couple, both, infertility, and, subfertility, are, defined, similarly, and, often, used, interchangeably, but, subfertility, is, the, delay, in, conceiving, within, six, to, twelve, months, whereas, infertility, is, the, inability, to, conceive, naturally, within, a, full, year, the, world, health, organization, defines, infertility, as, follows, infertility, is, a, disease, of, the, reproductive, system, defined, by, the, failure, to, achieve, a, clinical, pregnancy, after, 12, months, or, more, of, regular, unprotected, sexual, intercourse, and, there, is, no, other, reason, such, as, breastfeeding, or, postpartum, amenorrhoea, primary, infertility, is, infertility, in, a, couple, who, have, never, had, a, child, secondary, infertility, is, failure, to, conceive, following, a, previous, pregnancy, infertility, may, be, caused, by, infection, in, the, man, or, woman, but, often, there, is, no, obvious, underlying, cause, one, definition, of, infertility, that, is, frequently, used, in, the, united, states, by, reproductive, endocrinologists, doctors, who, specialize, in, infertility, to, consider, a, couple, eligible, for, treatment, is, these, time, intervals, would, seem, to, be, reversed, this, is, an, area, where, public, policy, trumps, science, the, idea, is, that, for, women, beyond, age, 35, every, month, counts, and, if, made, to, wait, another, six, months, to, prove, the, necessity, of, medical, intervention, the, problem, could, become, worse, the, corollary, to, this, is, that, by, definition, failure, to, conceive, in, women, under, 35, is, not, regarded, with, the, same, urgency, as, it, is, in, those, over, 35, in, the, uk, previous, nice, guidelines, defined, infertility, as, failure, to, conceive, after, regular, unprotected, sexual, intercourse, for, two, years, in, the, absence, of, known, reproductive, pathology, updated, nice, guidelines, do, not, include, a, specific, definition, but, recommend, that, a, woman, of, reproductive, age, who, has, not, conceived, after, 1, year, of, unprotected, vaginal, sexual, intercourse, in, the, absence, of, any, known, cause, of, infertility, should, be, offered, further, clinical, assessment, and, investigation, along, with, her, partner, with, earlier, referral, to, a, specialist, if, the, woman, is, over, 36, years, of, age, researchers, commonly, base, demographic, studies, on, infertility, prevalence, over, a, five, year, period, practical, measurement, problems, however, exist, for, any, definition, because, it, is, difficult, to, measure, continuous, exposure, to, the, risk, of, pregnancy, over, a, period, of, years, primary, infertility, is, defined, as, the, absence, of, a, live, birth, for, women, who, desire, a, child, and, have, been, in, a, union, for, at, least, 12, months, during, which, they, have, not, used, any, contraceptives, the, world, health, organisation, also, adds, that, women, whose, pregnancy, spontaneously, miscarries, or, whose, pregnancy, results, in, a, still, born, child, without, ever, having, had, a, live, birth, would, present, with, primarily, infertility, secondary, infertility, is, defined, as, the, absence, of, a, live, birth, for, women, who, desire, a, child, and, have, been, in, a, union, for, at, least, 12, months, since, their, last, live, birth, during, which, they, did, not, use, any, contraceptives, thus, the, distinguishing, feature, is, whether, or, not, the, couple, have, ever, had, a, pregnancy, that, led, to, a, live, birth, the, consequences, of, infertility, are, manifold, and, can, include, societal, repercussions, and, personal, suffering, advances, in, assisted, reproductive, technologies, such, as, ivf, can, offer, hope, to, many, couples, where, treatment, is, available, although, barriers, exist, in, terms, of, medical, coverage, and, affordability, the, medicalization, of, infertility, has, unwittingly, led, to, a, disregard, for, the, emotional, responses, that, couples, experience, which, include, distress, loss, of, control, stigmatization, and, a, disruption, in, the, developmental, trajectory, of, adulthood, one, of, the, main, challenges, in, assessing, the, distress, levels, in, women, with, infertility, is, the, accuracy, of, self, report, measures, it, is, possible, that, women, fake, good, in, order, to, appear, mentally, healthier, than, they, are, it, is, also, possible, that, women, feel, a, sense, of, hopefulness, increased, optimism, prior, to, initiating, infertility, treatment, which, is, when, most, assessments, of, distress, are, collected, some, early, studies, concluded, that, infertile, women, did, not, report, any, significant, differences, in, symptoms, of, anxiety, and, depression, than, fertile, women, the, further, into, treatment, a, patient, goes, the, more, often, they, display, symptoms, of, depression, and, anxiety, patients, with, one, treatment, failure, had, significantly, higher, levels, of, anxiety, and, patients, with, two, failures, experienced, more, depression, when, compared, with, those, without, a, history, of, treatment, however, it, has, also, been, shown, that, the, more, depressed, the, infertile, woman, the, less, likely, she, is, to, start, infertility, treatment, and, the, more, likely, she, is, to, drop, out, after, only, one, cycle, researchers, have, also, shown, that, despite, a, good, prognosis, and, having, the, finances, available, to, pay, for, treatment, discontinuation, is, most, often, due, to, psychological, reasons, fertility, does, not, seem, to, increase, when, the, women, takes, antioxidants, to, reduce, the, oxidative, stress, brought, by, the, situation, infertility, may, have, psychological, effects, parenthood, is, one, of, the, major, transitions, in, adult, life, for, both, men, and, women, the, stress, of, the, non, fulfilment, of, a, wish, for, a, child, has, been, associated, with, emotional, consequences, such, as, anger, depression, anxiety, marital, problems, and, feelings, of, worthlessness, partners, may, become, more, anxious, to, conceive, increasing, sexual, dysfunction, marital, discord, often, develops, especially, when, they, are, under, pressure, to, make, medical, decisions, women, trying, to, conceive, often, have, depression, rates, similar, to, women, who, have, heart, disease, or, cancer, emotional, stress, and, marital, difficulties, are, greater, in, couples, where, the, infertility, lies, with, the, man, male, and, female, partner, respond, differently, to, infertility, problems, in, general, women, show, higher, depression, levels, than, their, male, partners, when, dealing, with, infertility, a, possible, explanation, may, be, that, women, feel, more, responsible, and, guilty, than, men, during, the, process, of, trying, to, conceive, on, the, other, hand, infertile, men, experience, a, psychosomatic, distress, having, a, child, is, considered, to, be, important, in, most, societies, infertile, couples, may, experience, social, and, family, pressure, leading, to, a, feeling, of, social, isolation, factors, of, gender, age, religion, and, socioeconomic, status, are, important, influences, societal, pressures, may, affect, a, couple, s, decision, to, approach, avoid, or, experience, an, infertility, treatment, moreover, the, socioeconomic, status, influences, the, psychology, of, the, infertile, couples, low, socioeconomic, status, is, associated, with, increased, chances, of, developing, depression, in, many, cultures, inability, to, conceive, bears, a, stigma, in, closed, social, groups, a, degree, of, rejection, or, a, sense, of, being, rejected, by, the, couple, may, cause, considerable, anxiety, and, disappointment, some, respond, by, actively, avoiding, the, issue, altogether, in, the, united, states, some, treatments, for, infertility, including, diagnostic, tests, surgery, and, therapy, for, depression, can, qualify, one, for, family, and, medical, leave, act, leave, it, has, been, suggested, that, infertility, be, classified, as, a, form, of, disability, couples, that, suffer, from, infertility, have, a, higher, risk, than, other, couples, to, develop, sexual, dysfunctions, the, most, common, sexual, issue, facing, the, couples, is, a, decline, of, sexual, desire, and, erectile, dysfunction, male, infertility, is, responsible, for, 20, 30, of, infertility, cases, while, 20, 35, are, due, to, female, infertility, and, 25, 40, are, due, to, combined, problems, in, both, parts, in, 10, 20, of, cases, no, cause, is, found, the, most, common, cause, of, female, infertility, are, ovulation, problems, usually, manifested, by, scanty, or, absent, menstrual, periods, male, infertility, is, most, commonly, due, to, deficiencies, in, the, semen, and, semen, quality, is, used, as, a, surrogate, measure, of, male, fecundity, iodine, deficiency, may, lead, to, infertility, before, puberty, humans, are, naturally, infertile, their, gonads, have, not, yet, developed, the, gametes, required, to, reproduce, boys, testicles, have, not, developed, the, sperm, cells, required, to, impregnate, a, female, girls, have, not, begun, the, process, of, ovulation, which, activates, the, fertility, of, their, egg, cells, ovulation, is, confirmed, by, the, first, menstrual, cycle, known, as, menarche, which, signals, the, biological, possibility, of, pregnancy, infertility, in, children, is, commonly, referred, to, as, prepubescence, or, being, prepubescent, an, adjective, used, to, also, refer, to, humans, without, secondary, sex, characteristics, the, absence, of, fertility, in, children, is, considered, a, natural, part, of, human, growth, and, child, development, as, the, hypothalamus, in, their, brain, is, still, underdeveloped, and, cannot, release, the, hormones, required, to, activate, the, gonads, gametes, fertility, in, children, before, the, ages, of, eight, or, nine, is, considered, a, disease, known, as, precocious, puberty, this, disease, is, usually, triggered, by, a, brain, tumor, or, other, related, injury, delayed, puberty, puberty, absent, past, or, occurring, later, than, the, average, onset, between, the, ages, of, ten, and, fourteen, may, be, a, cause, of, infertility, in, the, united, states, girls, are, considered, to, have, delayed, puberty, if, they, have, not, started, menstruating, by, age, 16, alongside, lacking, breast, development, by, age, 13, boys, are, considered, to, have, delayed, puberty, if, they, lack, enlargement, of, the, testicles, by, age, 14, delayed, puberty, affects, about, 2, of, adolescents, most, commonly, puberty, may, be, delayed, for, several, years, and, still, occur, normally, in, which, case, it, is, considered, constitutional, delay, of, growth, and, puberty, a, common, variation, of, healthy, physical, development, delay, of, puberty, may, also, occur, due, to, various, causes, such, as, malnutrition, various, systemic, diseases, or, defects, of, the, reproductive, system, hypogonadism, or, the, body, s, responsiveness, to, sex, hormones, antisperm, antibodies, asa, have, been, considered, as, infertility, cause, in, around, 10, 30, of, infertile, couples, in, both, men, and, women, asa, production, are, directed, against, surface, antigens, on, sperm, which, can, interfere, with, sperm, motility, and, transport, through, the, female, reproductive, tract, inhibiting, capacitation, and, acrosome, reaction, impaired, fertilization, influence, on, the, implantation, process, and, impaired, growth, and, development, of, the, embryo, the, antibodies, are, classified, into, different, groups, there, are, iga, igg, and, igm, antibodies, they, also, differ, in, the, location, of, the, spermatozoon, they, bind, on, head, mid, piece, tail, factors, contributing, to, the, formation, of, antisperm, antibodies, in, women, are, disturbance, of, normal, immunoregulatory, mechanisms, infection, violation, of, the, integrity, of, the, mucous, membranes, rape, and, unprotected, oral, or, anal, sex, risk, factors, for, the, formation, of, antisperm, antibodies, in, men, include, the, breakdown, of, the, blood, testis, barrier, trauma, and, surgery, orchitis, varicocele, infections, prostatitis, testicular, cancer, failure, of, immunosuppression, and, unprotected, receptive, anal, or, oral, sex, with, men, infections, with, the, following, sexually, transmitted, pathogens, have, a, negative, effect, on, fertility, chlamydia, trachomatis, and, neisseria, gonorrhoeae, there, is, a, consistent, association, of, mycoplasma, genitalium, infection, and, female, reproductive, tract, syndromes, m, genitalium, infection, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, infertility, mutations, to, nr5a1, gene, encoding, steroidogenic, factor, 1, sf, 1, have, been, found, in, a, small, subset, of, men, with, non, obstructive, male, factor, infertility, where, the, cause, is, unknown, results, of, one, study, investigating, a, cohort, of, 315, men, revealed, changes, within, the, hinge, region, of, sf, 1, and, no, rare, allelic, variants, in, fertile, control, men, affected, individuals, displayed, more, severe, forms, of, infertility, such, as, azoospermia, and, severe, oligozoospermia, small, supernumerary, marker, chromosomes, are, abnormal, extra, chromosomes, they, are, three, times, more, likely, to, occur, in, infertile, individuals, and, account, for, 0, 125, of, all, infertility, cases, see, infertility, associated, with, small, supernumerary, marker, chromosomes, and, genetics, of, infertility, small, supernumerary, marker, chromosomes, and, infertility, factors, that, can, cause, male, as, well, as, female, infertility, are, german, scientists, have, reported, that, a, virus, called, adeno, associated, virus, might, have, a, role, in, male, infertility, though, it, is, otherwise, not, harmful, other, diseases, such, as, chlamydia, and, gonorrhea, can, also, cause, infertility, due, to, internal, scarring, fallopian, tube, obstruction, the, following, causes, of, infertility, may, only, be, found, in, females, for, a, woman, to, conceive, certain, things, have, to, happen, vaginal, intercourse, must, take, place, around, the, time, when, an, egg, is, released, from, her, ovary, the, system, that, produces, eggs, has, to, be, working, at, optimum, levels, and, her, hormones, must, be, balanced, for, women, problems, with, fertilization, arise, mainly, from, either, structural, problems, in, the, fallopian, tube, or, uterus, or, problems, releasing, eggs, infertility, may, be, caused, by, blockage, of, the, fallopian, tube, due, to, malformations, infections, such, as, chlamydia, or, scar, tissue, for, example, endometriosis, can, cause, infertility, with, the, growth, of, endometrial, tissue, in, the, fallopian, tubes, or, around, the, ovaries, endometriosis, is, usually, more, common, in, women, in, their, mid, twenties, and, older, especially, when, postponed, childbirth, has, taken, place, another, major, cause, of, infertility, in, women, may, be, the, inability, to, ovulate, ovulatory, disorders, make, up, 25, of, the, known, causes, of, female, infertility, oligo, ovulation, or, anovulation, results, in, infertility, because, no, oocyte, will, be, released, monthly, in, the, absence, of, an, oocyte, there, is, no, opportunity, for, fertilization, and, pregnancy, world, health, organization, subdivided, ovulatory, disorders, into, four, classes, malformation, of, the, eggs, themselves, may, complicate, conception, for, example, polycystic, ovarian, syndrome, pcos, is, when, the, eggs, only, partially, develop, within, the, ovary, and, there, is, an, excess, of, male, hormones, some, women, are, infertile, because, their, ovaries, do, not, mature, and, release, eggs, in, this, case, synthetic, fsh, by, injection, or, clomid, clomiphene, citrate, via, a, pill, can, be, given, to, stimulate, follicles, to, mature, in, the, ovaries, other, factors, that, can, affect, a, woman, s, chances, of, conceiving, include, being, overweight, or, underweight, or, her, age, as, female, fertility, declines, after, the, age, of, 30, sometimes, it, can, be, a, combination, of, factors, and, sometimes, a, clear, cause, is, never, established, common, causes, of, infertility, of, females, include, male, infertility, is, defined, as, the, inability, of, a, male, to, make, a, fertile, female, pregnant, for, a, minimum, of, at, least, one, year, of, unprotected, intercourse, there, are, multiple, causes, for, male, infertility, these, include, endocrine, disorders, usually, due, to, hypogonadism, at, an, estimated, 2, to, 5, sperm, transport, disorders, such, as, vasectomy, at, 5, primary, testicular, defects, which, includes, abnormal, sperm, parameters, without, any, identifiable, cause, at, 65, to, 80, and, idiopathic, where, an, infertile, male, has, normal, sperm, and, semen, parameters, at, 10, to, 20, the, main, cause, of, male, infertility, is, low, semen, quality, in, men, who, have, the, necessary, reproductive, organs, to, procreate, infertility, can, be, caused, by, low, sperm, count, due, to, endocrine, problems, drugs, radiation, or, infection, there, may, be, testicular, malformations, hormone, imbalance, or, blockage, of, the, man, s, duct, system, although, many, of, these, can, be, treated, through, surgery, or, hormonal, substitutions, some, may, be, indefinite, infertility, associated, with, viable, but, immotile, sperm, may, be, caused, by, primary, ciliary, dyskinesia, the, sperm, must, provide, the, zygote, with, dna, centrioles, and, activation, factor, for, the, embryo, to, develop, a, defect, in, any, of, these, sperm, structures, may, result, in, infertility, that, will, not, be, detected, by, semen, analysis, antisperm, antibodies, cause, immune, infertility, cystic, fibrosis, can, lead, to, infertility, in, men, in, some, cases, both, the, man, and, woman, may, be, infertile, or, subfertile, and, the, couple, s, infertility, arises, from, the, combination, of, these, conditions, in, other, cases, the, cause, is, suspected, to, be, immunological, or, genetic, it, may, be, that, each, partner, is, independently, fertile, but, the, couple, cannot, conceive, together, without, assistance, in, the, us, up, to, 20, of, infertile, couples, have, unexplained, infertility, in, these, cases, abnormalities, are, likely, to, be, present, but, not, detected, by, current, methods, possible, problems, could, be, that, the, egg, is, not, released, at, the, optimum, time, for, fertilization, that, it, may, not, enter, the, fallopian, tube, sperm, may, not, be, able, to, reach, the, egg, fertilization, may, fail, to, occur, transport, of, the, zygote, may, be, disturbed, or, implantation, fails, it, is, increasingly, recognized, that, egg, quality, is, of, critical, importance, and, women, of, advanced, maternal, age, have, eggs, of, reduced, capacity, for, normal, and, successful, fertilization, also, polymorphisms, in, folate, pathway, genes, could, be, one, reason, for, fertility, complications, in, some, women, with, unexplained, infertility, however, a, growing, body, of, evidence, suggests, that, epigenetic, modifications, in, sperm, may, be, partially, responsible, if, both, partners, are, young, and, healthy, and, have, been, trying, to, conceive, for, one, year, without, success, a, visit, to, a, physician, or, women, s, health, nurse, practitioner, whnp, could, help, to, highlight, potential, medical, problems, earlier, rather, than, later, the, doctor, or, whnp, may, also, be, able, to, suggest, lifestyle, changes, to, increase, the, chances, of, conceiving, however, there, are, instances, where, couples, should, seek, reproductive, counseling, after, only, 6, months, of, trying, for, a, pregnancy, a, doctor, or, whnp, takes, a, medical, history, and, gives, a, physical, examination, they, can, also, carry, out, some, basic, tests, on, both, partners, to, see, if, there, is, an, identifiable, reason, for, not, having, achieved, a, pregnancy, if, necessary, they, refer, patients, to, a, fertility, clinic, or, local, hospital, for, more, specialized, tests, the, results, of, these, tests, help, determine, the, best, fertility, treatment, treatment, depends, on, the, cause, of, infertility, but, may, include, counselling, fertility, treatments, which, include, in, vitro, fertilization, according, to, eshre, recommendations, couples, with, an, estimated, live, birth, rate, of, 40, or, higher, per, year, are, encouraged, to, continue, aiming, for, a, spontaneous, pregnancy, treatment, methods, for, infertility, may, be, grouped, as, medical, or, complementary, and, alternative, treatments, some, methods, may, be, used, in, concert, with, other, methods, drugs, used, for, both, women, and, men, include, clomiphene, citrate, human, menopausal, gonadotropin, hmg, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, human, chorionic, gonadotropin, hcg, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, gnrh, analogues, aromatase, inhibitors, and, metformin, medical, treatment, of, infertility, generally, involves, the, use, of, fertility, medication, medical, device, surgery, or, a, combination, of, the, following, if, the, sperm, is, of, good, quality, and, the, mechanics, of, the, woman, s, reproductive, structures, are, good, patent, fallopian, tubes, no, adhesions, or, scarring, a, course, of, ovulation, induction, may, be, used, the, physician, or, whnp, may, also, suggest, using, a, conception, cap, cervical, cap, which, the, patient, uses, at, home, by, placing, the, sperm, inside, the, cap, and, putting, the, conception, device, on, the, cervix, or, intrauterine, insemination, iui, in, which, the, doctor, or, whnp, introduces, sperm, into, the, uterus, during, ovulation, via, a, catheter, in, these, methods, fertilization, occurs, inside, the, body, if, conservative, medical, treatments, fail, to, achieve, a, full, term, pregnancy, the, physician, or, whnp, may, suggest, the, patient, to, undergo, in, vitro, fertilization, ivf, ivf, and, related, techniques, icsi, zift, gift, are, called, assisted, reproductive, technology, art, techniques, art, techniques, generally, start, with, stimulating, the, ovaries, to, increase, egg, production, after, stimulation, the, physician, surgically, extracts, one, or, more, eggs, from, the, ovary, and, unites, them, with, sperm, in, a, laboratory, setting, with, the, intent, of, producing, one, or, more, embryos, fertilization, takes, place, outside, the, body, and, the, fertilized, egg, is, reinserted, into, the, woman, s, reproductive, tract, in, a, procedure, called, embryo, transfer, other, medical, techniques, are, e, g, tuboplasty, assisted, hatching, and, preimplantation, genetic, diagnosis, ivf, is, the, most, commonly, used, art, it, has, been, proven, useful, in, overcoming, infertility, conditions, such, as, blocked, or, damaged, tubes, endometriosis, repeated, iui, failure, unexplained, infertility, poor, ovarian, reserve, poor, or, even, nil, sperm, count, this, technique, is, used, in, case, of, poor, semen, quality, low, sperm, count, failed, fertilization, or, occurrence, of, polyspermy, during, prior, ivf, cycles, a, single, healthy, sperm, is, injected, directly, into, a, mature, egg, the, fertilized, embryo, is, then, transferred, to, the, womb, this, method, was, first, developed, in, 1978, by, robert, edwards, and, patrick, steptoe, fertility, tourism, is, the, practice, of, traveling, to, another, country, for, fertility, treatments, it, may, be, regarded, as, a, form, of, medical, tourism, the, main, reasons, for, fertility, tourism, are, legal, regulation, of, the, sought, procedure, in, the, home, country, or, lower, price, in, vitro, fertilization, and, donor, insemination, are, major, procedures, involved, nowadays, there, are, several, treatments, still, in, experimentation, related, to, stem, cell, therapy, it, is, a, new, opportunity, not, only, for, partners, with, lack, of, gametes, but, also, for,
