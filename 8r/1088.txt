the, brazil, nut, bertholletia, excelsa, is, a, south, american, tree, in, the, family, lecythidaceae, and, it, is, also, the, name, of, the, tree, s, commercially, harvested, edible, seeds, it, is, one, of, the, largest, and, longest, lived, trees, in, the, amazon, rainforest, the, fruit, and, its, nutshell, containing, the, edible, brazil, nut, are, relatively, large, and, weigh, as, much, as, 2, kg, 4, 4, lb, in, total, as, food, brazil, nuts, are, notable, for, diverse, content, of, micronutrients, especially, a, high, amount, of, selenium, the, wood, of, the, brazil, nut, tree, is, prized, for, its, quality, in, carpentry, flooring, and, heavy, construction, in, portuguese, speaking, countries, like, brazil, they, are, variously, called, castanha, do, brasil, meaning, chestnuts, from, brazil, in, portuguese, castanha, do, par, meaning, chestnuts, from, par, in, portuguese, with, other, names, castanha, da, amaz, nia, castanha, do, acre, noz, amaz, nica, meaning, amazonian, nut, in, portuguese, noz, boliviana, tocari, probably, of, carib, origin, and, tururi, from, tupi, turu, ri, also, used, in, various, spanish, speaking, countries, of, south, america, brazil, nuts, are, called, casta, as, de, brasil, nuez, de, brasil, or, casta, as, de, par, or, para, in, north, america, as, early, as, 1896, brazil, nuts, were, sometimes, known, by, the, slang, term, nigger, toes, a, vulgarity, that, fell, out, of, use, after, the, racial, slur, became, more, socially, unacceptable, the, brazil, nut, is, a, large, tree, reaching, 50, metres, 160, feet, tall, and, with, a, trunk, 1, to, 2, m, 3, to, 7, ft, in, diameter, making, it, among, the, largest, of, trees, in, the, amazon, rainforest, it, may, live, for, 500, years, or, more, and, can, often, reach, a, thousand, years, of, age, the, stem, is, straight, and, commonly, without, branches, for, well, over, half, the, tree, s, height, with, a, large, emergent, crown, of, long, branches, above, the, surrounding, canopy, of, other, trees, the, bark, is, grayish, and, smooth, the, leaves, are, dry, season, deciduous, alternate, simple, entire, or, crenate, oblong, 20, 35, centimetres, 8, 14, inches, long, and, 10, 15, cm, 4, 6, in, broad, the, flowers, are, small, greenish, white, in, panicles, 5, 10, cm, 2, 4, in, long, each, flower, has, a, two, parted, deciduous, calyx, six, unequal, cream, colored, petals, and, numerous, stamens, united, into, a, broad, hood, shaped, mass, brazil, nut, trees, produce, fruit, almost, exclusively, in, pristine, forests, as, disturbed, forests, lack, the, large, bodied, bees, of, the, genera, bombus, centris, epicharis, eulaema, and, xylocopa, which, are, the, only, ones, capable, of, pollinating, the, tree, s, flowers, with, different, bee, genera, being, the, primary, pollinators, in, different, areas, and, different, times, of, year, brazil, nuts, have, been, harvested, from, plantations, but, production, is, low, and, is, currently, not, economically, viable, the, fruit, takes, 14, months, to, mature, after, pollination, of, the, flowers, the, fruit, itself, is, a, large, capsule, 10, 15, cm, 4, 6, in, in, diameter, resembling, a, coconut, endocarp, in, size, and, weighing, up, to, 2, kg, 4, lb, 7, oz, it, has, a, hard, woody, shell, 8, 12, mm, 3, 8, 1, 2, in, thick, which, contains, eight, to, 24, wedge, shaped, seeds, 4, 5, cm, 1, 5, 8, 2, in, long, the, brazil, nuts, packed, like, the, segments, of, an, orange, but, not, limited, to, one, whorl, of, segments, up, to, three, whorls, can, be, stacked, onto, each, other, with, the, polar, ends, of, the, segments, of, the, middle, whorl, nestling, into, the, upper, and, lower, whorls, see, illustration, above, the, capsule, contains, a, small, hole, at, one, end, which, enables, large, rodents, like, the, agouti, to, gnaw, it, open, they, then, eat, some, of, the, seeds, inside, while, burying, others, for, later, use, some, of, these, are, able, to, germinate, into, new, brazil, nut, trees, most, of, the, seeds, are, planted, by, the, agoutis, in, caches, during, wet, season, and, the, young, saplings, may, have, to, wait, years, in, a, state, of, dormancy, for, a, tree, to, fall, and, sunlight, to, reach, it, when, it, starts, growing, again, capuchin, monkeys, have, been, reported, to, open, brazil, nuts, using, a, stone, as, an, anvil, the, brazil, nut, family, the, lecythidaceae, is, in, the, order, ericales, as, are, other, well, known, plants, such, as, blueberries, cranberries, sapote, gutta, percha, tea, phlox, and, persimmons, the, tree, is, the, only, species, in, the, monotypic, genus, bertholletia, named, after, french, chemist, claude, louis, berthollet, the, brazil, nut, is, native, to, the, guianas, venezuela, brazil, eastern, colombia, eastern, peru, and, eastern, bolivia, it, occurs, as, scattered, trees, in, large, forests, on, the, banks, of, the, amazon, river, rio, negro, tapaj, s, and, the, orinoco, the, fruit, is, heavy, and, rigid, when, the, fruits, fall, they, pose, a, serious, threat, to, vehicles, and, potential, for, traumatic, brain, injury, of, people, passing, under, the, tree, in, 2020, global, production, of, brazil, nuts, in, shells, was, 69, 658, tonnes, most, of, which, derive, from, wild, harvests, in, tropical, forests, especially, the, amazon, regions, of, brazil, and, bolivia, which, produced, 92, of, the, world, total, table, since, most, of, the, production, for, international, trade, is, harvested, in, the, wild, the, business, arrangement, has, been, advanced, as, a, model, for, generating, income, from, a, tropical, forest, without, destroying, it, the, nuts, are, most, often, gathered, by, migrant, workers, known, as, casta, eros, in, spanish, or, castanheiros, in, portuguese, logging, is, a, significant, threat, to, the, sustainability, of, the, brazil, nut, harvesting, industry, analysis, of, tree, ages, in, areas, that, are, harvested, shows, that, moderate, and, intense, gathering, takes, so, many, seeds, that, not, enough, are, left, to, replace, older, trees, as, they, die, sites, with, light, gathering, activities, had, many, young, trees, while, sites, with, intense, gathering, practices, had, nearly, none, in, 2003, the, european, union, imposed, strict, regulations, on, the, import, of, brazilian, harvested, brazil, nuts, in, their, shells, as, the, shells, are, considered, to, contain, unsafe, levels, of, aflatoxins, a, potential, cause, of, liver, cancer, brazil, nuts, are, susceptible, to, contamination, by, aflatoxins, produced, by, fungi, once, they, fall, to, the, ground, aflatoxins, can, cause, liver, damage, including, possible, cancer, if, consumed, aflatoxin, levels, have, been, found, in, brazil, nuts, during, inspections, that, were, far, higher, than, the, limits, set, by, the, eu, however, mechanical, sorting, and, drying, was, found, to, eliminate, 98, of, aflatoxins, a, 2003, eu, ban, on, importation, was, rescinded, after, new, tolerance, levels, were, set, the, nuts, often, contain, radium, a, radioactive, element, with, a, kilogram, of, nuts, containing, an, activity, between, 40, and, 260, becquerels, 1, and, 7, nanocuries, this, level, of, radium, is, small, although, it, can, be, about, 1, 000, times, higher, than, in, other, common, foods, according, to, oak, ridge, associated, universities, elevated, levels, of, radium, in, the, soil, does, not, directly, cause, the, concentration, of, radium, but, the, very, extensive, root, system, of, the, tree, can, concentrate, naturally, occurring, radioactive, material, when, present, in, the, soil, radium, can, be, concentrated, in, nuts, only, if, it, is, present, in, the, soil, brazil, nuts, also, contain, barium, a, metal, with, a, chemical, behavior, quite, similar, to, radium, while, barium, if, ingested, can, have, toxic, effects, such, as, weakness, vomiting, or, diarrhea, the, amount, present, in, brazil, nuts, is, orders, of, magnitude, too, small, to, have, noticeable, health, effects, brazil, nuts, are, 3, water, 14, protein, 12, carbohydrates, and, 66, fats, table, the, fat, components, are, 16, saturated, 24, monounsaturated, and, 24, polyunsaturated, see, table, for, usda, source, in, a, 100, grams, 3, 5, ounces, reference, amount, brazil, nuts, supply, 659, calories, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, dietary, fiber, 30, dv, thiamin, 54, dv, vitamin, e, 38, dv, magnesium, 106, dv, phosphorus, 104, dv, manganese, 57, dv, and, zinc, 43, dv, calcium, iron, and, potassium, are, present, in, moderate, amounts, 10, 19, dv, table, brazil, nuts, are, a, particularly, rich, source, of, selenium, with, just, 28, g, 1, oz, supplying, 544, micrograms, of, selenium, or, 10, times, the, dv, of, 55, micrograms, see, table, for, usda, source, however, the, amount, of, selenium, within, batches, of, nuts, may, vary, considerably, the, high, selenium, content, is, used, as, a, biomarker, in, studies, of, selenium, intake, and, deficiency, consumption, of, just, one, brazil, nut, per, day, over, 8, weeks, was, sufficient, to, restore, selenium, blood, levels, and, increase, hdl, cholesterol, in, obese, women, brazil, nut, oil, contains, 48, unsaturated, fatty, acids, composed, mainly, of, oleic, and, linoleic, acids, the, phytosterol, beta, sitosterol, and, fat, soluble, vitamin, e, the, following, table, presents, the, composition, of, fatty, acids, in, brazil, nut, oil, see, usda, source, in, nutrition, table, the, lumber, from, brazil, nut, trees, not, to, be, confused, with, brazilwood, is, of, excellent, quality, having, diverse, uses, from, flooring, to, heavy, construction, logging, the, trees, is, prohibited, by, law, in, all, three, producing, countries, brazil, bolivia, and, peru, illegal, extraction, of, timber, and, land, clearances, present, continuing, threats, in, brazil, cutting, down, a, brazil, nut, tree, requires, previous, authorization, from, the, brazilian, institute, of, environment, and, renewable, natural, resources, brazil, nut, oil, is, used, as, a, lubricant, in, clocks, and, in, the, manufacturing, of, paint, and, cosmetics, such, as, soap, and, perfume, because, of, its, hardness, the, brazil, nutshell, is, often, pulverized, and, used, as, an, abrasive, to, polish, materials, such, as, metals, and, ceramics, in, the, same, way, as, jeweler, s, rouge, the, charcoal, from, the, nut, shells, may, be, used, to, purify, water
