a, leaf, pl, leaves, is, a, principal, appendage, of, the, stem, of, a, vascular, plant, usually, borne, laterally, aboveground, and, specialized, for, photosynthesis, leaves, are, collectively, called, foliage, as, in, autumn, foliage, while, the, leaves, stem, flower, and, fruit, collectively, form, the, shoot, system, in, most, leaves, the, primary, photosynthetic, tissue, is, the, palisade, mesophyll, and, is, located, on, the, upper, side, of, the, blade, or, lamina, of, the, leaf, but, in, some, species, including, the, mature, foliage, of, eucalyptus, palisade, mesophyll, is, present, on, both, sides, and, the, leaves, are, said, to, be, isobilateral, most, leaves, are, flattened, and, have, distinct, upper, adaxial, and, lower, abaxial, surfaces, that, differ, in, color, hairiness, the, number, of, stomata, pores, that, intake, and, output, gases, the, amount, and, structure, of, epicuticular, wax, and, other, features, leaves, are, mostly, green, in, color, due, to, the, presence, of, a, compound, called, chlorophyll, which, is, essential, for, photosynthesis, as, it, absorbs, light, energy, from, the, sun, a, leaf, with, lighter, colored, or, white, patches, or, edges, is, called, a, variegated, leaf, leaves, can, have, many, different, shapes, sizes, textures, and, colors, the, broad, flat, leaves, with, complex, venation, of, flowering, plants, are, known, as, megaphylls, and, the, species, that, bear, them, the, majority, as, broad, leaved, or, megaphyllous, plants, which, also, include, acrogymnosperms, and, ferns, in, the, lycopods, with, different, evolutionary, origins, the, leaves, are, simple, with, only, a, single, vein, and, are, known, as, microphylls, some, leaves, such, as, bulb, scales, are, not, above, ground, in, many, aquatic, species, the, leaves, are, submerged, in, water, succulent, plants, often, have, thick, juicy, leaves, but, some, leaves, are, without, major, photosynthetic, function, and, may, be, dead, at, maturity, as, in, some, cataphylls, and, spines, furthermore, several, kinds, of, leaf, like, structures, found, in, vascular, plants, are, not, totally, homologous, with, them, examples, include, flattened, plant, stems, called, phylloclades, and, cladodes, and, flattened, leaf, stems, called, phyllodes, which, differ, from, leaves, both, in, their, structure, and, origin, some, structures, of, non, vascular, plants, look, and, function, much, like, leaves, examples, include, the, phyllids, of, mosses, and, liverworts, leaves, are, the, most, important, organs, of, most, vascular, plants, green, plants, are, autotrophic, meaning, that, they, do, not, obtain, food, from, other, living, things, but, instead, create, their, own, food, by, photosynthesis, they, capture, the, energy, in, sunlight, and, use, it, to, make, simple, sugars, such, as, glucose, and, sucrose, from, carbon, dioxide, and, water, the, sugars, are, then, stored, as, starch, further, processed, by, chemical, synthesis, into, more, complex, organic, molecules, such, as, proteins, or, cellulose, the, basic, structural, material, in, plant, cell, walls, or, metabolized, by, cellular, respiration, to, provide, chemical, energy, to, run, cellular, processes, the, leaves, draw, water, from, the, ground, in, the, transpiration, stream, through, a, vascular, conducting, system, known, as, xylem, and, obtain, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, by, diffusion, through, openings, called, stomata, in, the, outer, covering, layer, of, the, leaf, epidermis, while, leaves, are, orientated, to, maximize, their, exposure, to, sunlight, once, sugar, has, been, synthesized, it, needs, to, be, transported, to, areas, of, active, growth, such, as, the, plant, shoots, and, roots, vascular, plants, transport, sucrose, in, a, special, tissue, called, the, phloem, the, phloem, and, xylem, are, parallel, to, each, other, but, the, transport, of, materials, is, usually, in, opposite, directions, within, the, leaf, these, vascular, systems, branch, ramify, to, form, veins, which, supply, as, much, of, the, leaf, as, possible, ensuring, that, cells, carrying, out, photosynthesis, are, close, to, the, transportation, system, typically, leaves, are, broad, flat, and, thin, dorsiventrally, flattened, thereby, maximising, the, surface, area, directly, exposed, to, light, and, enabling, the, light, to, penetrate, the, tissues, and, reach, the, chloroplasts, thus, promoting, photosynthesis, they, are, arranged, on, the, plant, so, as, to, expose, their, surfaces, to, light, as, efficiently, as, possible, without, shading, each, other, but, there, are, many, exceptions, and, complications, for, instance, plants, adapted, to, windy, conditions, may, have, pendent, leaves, such, as, in, many, willows, and, eucalypts, the, flat, or, laminar, shape, also, maximizes, thermal, contact, with, the, surrounding, air, promoting, cooling, functionally, in, addition, to, carrying, out, photosynthesis, the, leaf, is, the, principal, site, of, transpiration, providing, the, energy, required, to, draw, the, transpiration, stream, up, from, the, roots, and, guttation, many, conifers, have, thin, needle, like, or, scale, like, leaves, that, can, be, advantageous, in, cold, climates, with, frequent, snow, and, frost, these, are, interpreted, as, reduced, from, megaphyllous, leaves, of, their, devonian, ancestors, some, leaf, forms, are, adapted, to, modulate, the, amount, of, light, they, absorb, to, avoid, or, mitigate, excessive, heat, ultraviolet, damage, or, desiccation, or, to, sacrifice, light, absorption, efficiency, in, favor, of, protection, from, herbivory, for, xerophytes, the, major, constraint, is, not, light, flux, or, intensity, but, drought, some, window, plants, such, as, fenestraria, species, and, some, haworthia, species, such, as, haworthia, tesselata, and, haworthia, truncata, are, examples, of, xerophytes, and, bulbine, mesembryanthemoides, leaves, also, function, to, store, chemical, energy, and, water, especially, in, succulents, and, may, become, specialized, organs, serving, other, functions, such, as, tendrils, of, peas, and, other, legumes, the, protective, spines, of, cacti, and, the, insect, traps, in, carnivorous, plants, such, as, nepenthes, and, sarracenia, leaves, are, the, fundamental, structural, units, from, which, cones, are, constructed, in, gymnosperms, each, cone, scale, is, a, modified, megaphyll, leaf, known, as, a, sporophyll, 408, and, from, which, flowers, are, constructed, in, flowering, plants, 445, the, internal, organization, of, most, kinds, of, leaves, has, evolved, to, maximize, exposure, of, the, photosynthetic, organelles, the, chloroplasts, to, light, and, to, increase, the, absorption, of, carbon, dioxide, while, at, the, same, time, controlling, water, loss, their, surfaces, are, waterproofed, by, the, plant, cuticle, and, gas, exchange, between, the, mesophyll, cells, and, the, atmosphere, is, controlled, by, minute, length, and, width, measured, in, tens, of, m, openings, called, stomata, which, open, or, close, to, regulate, the, rate, exchange, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, oxygen, o, 2, and, water, vapor, into, and, out, of, the, internal, intercellular, space, system, stomatal, opening, is, controlled, by, the, turgor, pressure, in, a, pair, of, guard, cells, that, surround, the, stomatal, aperture, in, any, square, centimeter, of, a, plant, leaf, there, may, be, from, 1, 000, to, 100, 000, stomata, the, shape, and, structure, of, leaves, vary, considerably, from, species, to, species, of, plant, depending, largely, on, their, adaptation, to, climate, and, available, light, but, also, to, other, factors, such, as, grazing, animals, such, as, deer, available, nutrients, and, ecological, competition, from, other, plants, considerable, changes, in, leaf, type, occur, within, species, too, for, example, as, a, plant, matures, as, a, case, in, point, eucalyptus, species, commonly, have, isobilateral, pendent, leaves, when, mature, and, dominating, their, neighbors, however, such, trees, tend, to, have, erect, or, horizontal, dorsiventral, leaves, as, seedlings, when, their, growth, is, limited, by, the, available, light, other, factors, include, the, need, to, balance, water, loss, at, high, temperature, and, low, humidity, against, the, need, to, absorb, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, in, most, plants, leaves, also, are, the, primary, organs, responsible, for, transpiration, and, guttation, beads, of, fluid, forming, at, leaf, margins, leaves, can, also, store, food, and, water, and, are, modified, accordingly, to, meet, these, functions, for, example, in, the, leaves, of, succulent, plants, and, in, bulb, scales, the, concentration, of, photosynthetic, structures, in, leaves, requires, that, they, be, richer, in, protein, minerals, and, sugars, than, say, woody, stem, tissues, accordingly, leaves, are, prominent, in, the, diet, of, many, animals, correspondingly, leaves, represent, heavy, investment, on, the, part, of, the, plants, bearing, them, and, their, retention, or, disposition, are, the, subject, of, elaborate, strategies, for, dealing, with, pest, pressures, seasonal, conditions, and, protective, measures, such, as, the, growth, of, thorns, and, the, production, of, phytoliths, lignins, tannins, and, poisons, deciduous, plants, in, frigid, or, cold, temperate, regions, typically, shed, their, leaves, in, autumn, whereas, in, areas, with, a, severe, dry, season, some, plants, may, shed, their, leaves, until, the, dry, season, ends, in, either, case, the, shed, leaves, may, be, expected, to, contribute, their, retained, nutrients, to, the, soil, where, they, fall, in, contrast, many, other, non, seasonal, plants, such, as, palms, and, conifers, retain, their, leaves, for, long, periods, welwitschia, retains, its, two, main, leaves, throughout, a, lifetime, that, may, exceed, a, thousand, years, the, leaf, like, organs, of, bryophytes, e, g, mosses, and, liverworts, known, as, phyllids, differ, heavily, morphologically, from, the, leaves, of, vascular, plants, in, most, cases, they, lack, vascular, tissue, are, only, a, single, cell, thick, and, have, no, cuticle, stomata, or, internal, system, of, intercellular, spaces, the, phyllids, of, the, moss, family, polytrichaceae, are, notable, exceptions, the, phyllids, of, bryophytes, are, only, present, on, the, gametophytes, while, in, contrast, the, leaves, of, vascular, plants, are, only, present, on, the, sporophytes, these, can, further, develop, into, either, vegetative, or, reproductive, structures, simple, vascularized, leaves, microphylls, such, as, those, of, the, early, devonian, lycopsid, baragwanathia, first, evolved, as, enations, extensions, of, the, stem, true, leaves, or, euphylls, of, larger, size, and, with, more, complex, venation, did, not, become, widespread, in, other, groups, until, the, devonian, period, by, which, time, the, carbon, dioxide, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, had, dropped, significantly, this, occurred, independently, in, several, separate, lineages, of, vascular, plants, in, progymnosperms, like, archaeopteris, in, sphenopsida, ferns, and, later, in, the, gymnosperms, and, angiosperms, euphylls, are, also, referred, to, as, macrophylls, or, megaphylls, large, leaves, a, structurally, complete, leaf, of, an, angiosperm, consists, of, a, petiole, leaf, stalk, a, lamina, leaf, blade, stipules, small, structures, located, to, either, side, of, the, base, of, the, petiole, and, a, sheath, not, every, species, produces, leaves, with, all, of, these, structural, components, the, proximal, stalk, or, petiole, is, called, a, stipe, in, ferns, the, lamina, is, the, expanded, flat, component, of, the, leaf, which, contains, the, chloroplasts, the, sheath, is, a, structure, typically, at, the, base, that, fully, or, partially, clasps, the, stem, above, the, node, where, the, leaf, is, attached, leaf, sheathes, typically, occur, in, poaceae, grasses, and, apiaceae, umbellifers, between, the, sheath, and, the, lamina, there, may, be, a, pseudopetiole, a, petiole, like, structure, pseudopetioles, occur, in, some, monocotyledons, including, bananas, palms, and, bamboos, stipules, may, be, conspicuous, e, g, beans, and, roses, soon, falling, or, otherwise, not, obvious, as, in, moraceae, or, absent, altogether, as, in, the, magnoliaceae, a, petiole, may, be, absent, apetiolate, or, the, blade, may, not, be, laminar, flattened, the, petiole, mechanically, links, the, leaf, to, the, plant, and, provides, the, route, for, transfer, of, water, and, sugars, to, and, from, the, leaf, the, lamina, is, typically, the, location, of, the, majority, of, photosynthesis, the, upper, adaxial, angle, between, a, leaf, and, a, stem, is, known, as, the, axil, of, the, leaf, it, is, often, the, location, of, a, bud, structures, located, there, are, called, axillary, external, leaf, characteristics, such, as, shape, margin, hairs, the, petiole, and, the, presence, of, stipules, and, glands, are, frequently, important, for, identifying, plants, to, family, genus, or, species, levels, and, botanists, have, developed, a, rich, terminology, for, describing, leaf, characteristics, leaves, almost, always, have, determinate, growth, they, grow, to, a, specific, pattern, and, shape, and, then, stop, other, plant, parts, like, stems, or, roots, have, non, determinate, growth, and, will, usually, continue, to, grow, as, long, as, they, have, the, resources, to, do, so, the, type, of, leaf, is, usually, characteristic, of, a, species, monomorphic, although, some, species, produce, more, than, one, type, of, leaf, dimorphic, or, polymorphic, the, longest, leaves, are, those, of, the, raffia, palm, r, regalis, which, may, be, up, to, 25, m, 82, ft, long, and, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, wide, the, terminology, associated, with, the, description, of, leaf, morphology, is, presented, in, illustrated, form, at, wikibooks, where, leaves, are, basal, and, lie, on, the, ground, they, are, referred, to, as, prostrate, perennial, plants, whose, leaves, are, shed, annually, are, said, to, have, deciduous, leaves, while, leaves, that, remain, through, winter, are, evergreens, leaves, attached, to, stems, by, stalks, known, as, petioles, are, called, petiolate, and, if, attached, directly, to, the, stem, with, no, petiole, they, are, called, sessile, dicot, leaves, have, blades, with, pinnate, venation, where, major, veins, diverge, from, one, large, mid, vein, and, have, smaller, connecting, networks, between, them, less, commonly, dicot, leaf, blades, may, have, palmate, venation, several, large, veins, diverging, from, petiole, to, leaf, edges, finally, some, exhibit, parallel, venation, monocot, leaves, in, temperate, climates, usually, have, narrow, blades, and, usually, parallel, venation, converging, at, leaf, tips, or, edges, some, also, have, pinnate, venation, the, arrangement, of, leaves, on, the, stem, is, known, as, phyllotaxis, a, large, variety, of, phyllotactic, patterns, occur, in, nature, in, the, simplest, mathematical, models, of, phyllotaxis, the, apex, of, the, stem, is, represented, as, a, circle, each, new, node, is, formed, at, the, apex, and, it, is, rotated, by, a, constant, angle, from, the, previous, node, this, angle, is, called, the, divergence, angle, the, number, of, leaves, that, grow, from, a, node, depends, on, the, plant, species, when, a, single, leaf, grows, from, each, node, and, when, the, stem, is, held, straight, the, leaves, form, a, helix, the, divergence, angle, is, often, represented, as, a, fraction, of, a, full, rotation, around, the, stem, a, rotation, fraction, of, 1, 2, a, divergence, angle, of, 180, produces, an, alternate, arrangement, such, as, in, gasteria, or, the, fan, aloe, kumara, plicatilis, rotation, fractions, of, 1, 3, divergence, angles, of, 120, occur, in, beech, and, hazel, oak, and, apricot, rotate, by, 2, 5, sunflowers, poplar, and, pear, by, 3, 8, and, in, willow, and, almond, the, fraction, is, 5, 13, these, arrangements, are, periodic, the, denominator, of, the, rotation, fraction, indicates, the, number, of, leaves, in, one, period, while, the, numerator, indicates, the, number, of, complete, turns, or, gyres, made, in, one, period, for, example, most, divergence, angles, are, related, to, the, sequence, of, fibonacci, numbers, f, n, this, sequence, begins, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, each, term, is, the, sum, of, the, previous, two, rotation, fractions, are, often, quotients, f, n, f, n, 2, of, a, fibonacci, number, by, the, number, two, terms, later, in, the, sequence, this, is, the, case, for, the, fractions, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 8, and, 5, 13, the, ratio, between, successive, fibonacci, numbers, tends, to, the, golden, ratio, 1, 5, 2, when, a, circle, is, divided, into, two, arcs, whose, lengths, are, in, the, ratio, 1, the, angle, formed, by, the, smaller, arc, is, the, golden, angle, which, is, 1, 2, 360, 137, 5, because, of, this, many, divergence, angles, are, approximately, 137, 5, in, plants, where, a, pair, of, opposite, leaves, grows, from, each, node, the, leaves, form, a, double, helix, if, the, nodes, do, not, rotate, a, rotation, fraction, of, zero, and, a, divergence, angle, of, 0, the, two, helices, become, a, pair, of, parallel, lines, creating, a, distichous, arrangement, as, in, maple, or, olive, trees, more, common, in, a, decussate, pattern, in, which, each, node, rotates, by, 1, 4, 90, as, in, the, herb, basil, the, leaves, of, tricussate, plants, such, as, nerium, oleander, form, a, triple, helix, the, leaves, of, some, plants, do, not, form, helices, in, some, plants, the, divergence, angle, changes, as, the, plant, grows, in, orixate, phyllotaxis, named, after, orixa, japonica, the, divergence, angle, is, not, constant, instead, it, is, periodic, and, follows, the, sequence, 180, 90, 180, 270, two, basic, forms, of, leaves, can, be, described, considering, the, way, the, blade, lamina, is, divided, a, simple, leaf, has, an, undivided, blade, however, the, leaf, may, be, dissected, to, form, lobes, but, the, gaps, between, lobes, do, not, reach, to, the, main, vein, a, compound, leaf, has, a, fully, subdivided, blade, each, leaflet, of, the, blade, being, separated, along, a, main, or, secondary, vein, the, leaflets, may, have, petiolules, and, stipels, the, equivalents, of, the, petioles, and, stipules, of, leaves, because, each, leaflet, can, appear, to, be, a, simple, leaf, it, is, important, to, recognize, where, the, petiole, occurs, to, identify, a, compound, leaf, compound, leaves, are, a, characteristic, of, some, families, of, higher, plants, such, as, the, fabaceae, the, middle, vein, of, a, compound, leaf, or, a, frond, when, it, is, present, is, called, a, rachis, leaves, which, have, a, petiole, leaf, stalk, are, said, to, be, petiolate, sessile, epetiolate, leaves, have, no, petiole, and, the, blade, attaches, directly, to, the, stem, subpetiolate, leaves, are, nearly, petiolate, or, have, an, extremely, short, petiole, and, may, appear, to, be, sessile, in, clasping, or, decurrent, leaves, the, blade, partially, surrounds, the, stem, when, the, leaf, base, completely, surrounds, the, stem, the, leaves, are, said, to, be, perfoliate, such, as, in, eupatorium, perfoliatum, in, peltate, leaves, the, petiole, attaches, to, the, blade, inside, the, blade, margin, in, some, acacia, species, such, as, the, koa, tree, acacia, koa, the, petioles, are, expanded, or, broadened, and, function, like, leaf, blades, these, are, called, phyllodes, there, may, or, may, not, be, normal, pinnate, leaves, at, the, tip, of, the, phyllode, a, stipule, present, on, the, leaves, of, many, dicotyledons, is, an, appendage, on, each, side, at, the, base, of, the, petiole, resembling, a, small, leaf, stipules, may, be, lasting, and, not, be, shed, a, stipulate, leaf, such, as, in, roses, and, beans, or, be, shed, as, the, leaf, expands, leaving, a, stipule, scar, on, the, twig, an, exstipulate, leaf, the, situation, arrangement, and, structure, of, the, stipules, is, called, the, stipulation, veins, sometimes, referred, to, as, nerves, constitute, one, of, the, most, visible, features, of, leaves, the, veins, in, a, leaf, represent, the, vascular, structure, of, the, organ, extending, into, the, leaf, via, the, petiole, and, providing, transportation, of, water, and, nutrients, between, leaf, and, stem, and, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, maintenance, of, leaf, water, status, and, photosynthetic, capacity, they, also, play, a, role, in, the, mechanical, support, of, the, leaf, within, the, lamina, of, the, leaf, while, some, vascular, plants, possess, only, a, single, vein, in, most, this, vasculature, generally, divides, ramifies, according, to, a, variety, of, patterns, venation, and, form, cylindrical, bundles, usually, lying, in, the, median, plane, of, the, mesophyll, between, the, two, layers, of, epidermis, this, pattern, is, often, specific, to, taxa, and, of, which, angiosperms, possess, two, main, types, parallel, and, reticulate, net, like, in, general, parallel, venation, is, typical, of, monocots, while, reticulate, is, more, typical, of, eudicots, and, magnoliids, dicots, though, there, are, many, exceptions, the, vein, or, veins, entering, the, leaf, from, the, petiole, are, called, primary, or, first, order, veins, the, veins, branching, from, these, are, secondary, or, second, order, veins, these, primary, and, secondary, veins, are, considered, major, veins, or, lower, order, veins, though, some, authors, include, third, order, each, subsequent, branching, is, sequentially, numbered, and, these, are, the, higher, order, veins, each, branching, being, associated, with, a, narrower, vein, diameter, in, parallel, veined, leaves, the, primary, veins, run, parallel, and, equidistant, to, each, other, for, most, of, the, length, of, the, leaf, and, then, converge, or, fuse, anastomose, towards, the, apex, usually, many, smaller, minor, veins, interconnect, these, primary, veins, but, may, terminate, with, very, fine, vein, endings, in, the, mesophyll, minor, veins, are, more, typical, of, angiosperms, which, may, have, as, many, as, four, higher, orders, in, contrast, leaves, with, reticulate, venation, have, a, single, sometimes, more, primary, vein, in, the, centre, of, the, leaf, referred, to, as, the, midrib, or, costa, which, is, continuous, with, the, vasculature, of, the, petiole, the, secondary, veins, also, known, as, second, order, veins, or, lateral, veins, branch, off, from, the, midrib, and, extend, toward, the, leaf, margins, these, often, terminate, in, a, hydathode, a, secretory, organ, at, the, margin, in, turn, smaller, veins, branch, from, the, secondary, veins, known, as, tertiary, or, third, order, or, higher, order, veins, forming, a, dense, reticulate, pattern, the, areas, or, islands, of, mesophyll, lying, between, the, higher, order, veins, are, called, areoles, some, of, the, smallest, veins, veinlets, may, have, their, endings, in, the, areoles, a, process, known, as, areolation, these, minor, veins, act, as, the, sites, of, exchange, between, the, mesophyll, and, the, plant, s, vascular, system, thus, minor, veins, collect, the, products, of, photosynthesis, photosynthate, from, the, cells, where, it, takes, place, while, major, veins, are, responsible, for, its, transport, outside, of, the, leaf, at, the, same, time, water, is, being, transported, in, the, opposite, direction, the, number, of, vein, endings, is, very, variable, as, is, whether, second, order, veins, end, at, the, margin, or, link, back, to, other, veins, there, are, many, elaborate, variations, on, the, patterns, that, the, leaf, veins, form, and, these, have, functional, implications, of, these, angiosperms, have, the, greatest, diversity, within, these, the, major, veins, function, as, the, support, and, distribution, network, for, leaves, and, are, correlated, with, leaf, shape, for, instance, the, parallel, venation, found, in, most, monocots, correlates, with, their, elongated, leaf, shape, and, wide, leaf, base, while, reticulate, venation, is, seen, in, simple, entire, leaves, while, digitate, leaves, typically, have, venation, in, which, three, or, more, primary, veins, diverge, radially, from, a, single, point, in, evolutionary, terms, early, emerging, taxa, tend, to, have, dichotomous, branching, with, reticulate, systems, emerging, later, veins, appeared, in, the, permian, period, 299, 252, mya, prior, to, the, appearance, of, angiosperms, in, the, triassic, 252, 201, mya, during, which, vein, hierarchy, appeared, enabling, higher, function, larger, leaf, size, and, adaption, to, a, wider, variety, of, climatic, conditions, although, it, is, the, more, complex, pattern, branching, veins, appear, to, be, plesiomorphic, and, in, some, form, were, present, in, ancient, seed, plants, as, long, as, 250, million, years, ago, a, pseudo, reticulate, venation, that, is, actually, a, highly, modified, penniparallel, one, is, an, autapomorphy, of, some, melanthiaceae, which, are, monocots, e, g, paris, quadrifolia, true, lover, s, knot, in, leaves, with, reticulate, venation, veins, form, a, scaffolding, matrix, imparting, mechanical, rigidity, to, leaves, leaves, are, normally, extensively, vascularized, and, typically, have, networks, of, vascular, bundles, containing, xylem, which, supplies, water, for, photosynthesis, and, phloem, which, transports, the, sugars, produced, by, photosynthesis, many, leaves, are, covered, in, trichomes, small, hairs, which, have, diverse, structures, and, functions, the, major, tissue, systems, present, are, these, three, tissue, systems, typically, form, a, regular, organization, at, the, cellular, scale, specialized, cells, that, differ, markedly, from, surrounding, cells, and, which, often, synthesize, specialized, products, such, as, crystals, are, termed, idioblasts, the, epidermis, is, the, outer, layer, of, cells, covering, the, leaf, it, is, covered, with, a, waxy, cuticle, which, is, impermeable, to, liquid, water, and, water, vapor, and, forms, the, boundary, separating, the, plant, s, inner, cells, from, the, external, world, the, cuticle, is, in, some, cases, thinner, on, the, lower, epidermis, than, on, the, upper, epidermis, and, is, generally, thicker, on, leaves, from, dry, climates, as, compared, with, those, from, wet, climates, the, epidermis, serves, several, functions, protection, against, water, loss, by, way, of, transpiration, regulation, of, gas, exchange, and, secretion, of, metabolic, compounds, most, leaves, show, dorsoventral, anatomy, the, upper, adaxial, and, lower, abaxial, surfaces, have, somewhat, different, construction, and, may, serve, different, functions, the, epidermis, tissue, includes, several, differentiated, cell, types, epidermal, cells, epidermal, hair, cells, trichomes, cells, in, the, stomatal, complex, guard, cells, and, subsidiary, cells, the, epidermal, cells, are, the, most, numerous, largest, and, least, specialized, and, form, the, majority, of, the, epidermis, they, are, typically, more, elongated, in, the, leaves, of, monocots, than, in, those, of, dicots, chloroplasts, are, generally, absent, in, epidermal, cells, the, exception, being, the, guard, cells, of, the, stomata, the, stomatal, pores, perforate, the, epidermis, and, are, surrounded, on, each, side, by, chloroplast, containing, guard, cells, and, two, to, four, subsidiary, cells, that, lack, chloroplasts, forming, a, specialized, cell, group, known, as, the, stomatal, complex, the, opening, and, closing, of, the, stomatal, aperture, is, controlled, by, the, stomatal, complex, and, regulates, the, exchange, of, gases, and, water, vapor, between, the, outside, air, and, the, interior, of, the, leaf, stomata, therefore, play, the, important, role, in, allowing, photosynthesis, without, letting, the, leaf, dry, out, in, a, typical, leaf, the, stomata, are, more, numerous, over, the, abaxial, lower, epidermis, than, the, adaxial, upper, epidermis, and, are, more, numerous, in, plants, from, cooler, climates, most, of, the, interior, of, the, leaf, between, the, upper, and, lower, layers, of, epidermis, is, a, parenchyma, ground, tissue, or, chlorenchyma, tissue, called, the, mesophyll, greek, for, middle, leaf, this, assimilation, tissue, is, the, primary, location, of, photosynthesis, in, the, plant, the, products, of, photosynthesis, are, called, assimilates, in, ferns, and, most, flowering, plants, the, mesophyll, is, divided, into, two, layers, leaves, are, normally, green, due, to, chlorophyll, in, chloroplasts, in, the, mesophyll, cells, some, plants, have, leaves, of, different, colours, due, to, the, presence, of, accessory, pigments, such, as, carotenoids, in, their, mesophyll, cells, the, veins, are, the, vascular, tissue, of, the, leaf, and, are, located, in, the, spongy, layer, of, the, mesophyll, the, pattern, of, the, veins, is, called, venation, in, angiosperms, the, venation, is, typically, parallel, in, monocotyledons, and, forms, an, interconnecting, network, in, broad, leaved, plants, they, were, once, thought, to, be, typical, examples, of, pattern, formation, through, ramification, but, they, may, instead, exemplify, a, pattern, formed, in, a, stress, tensor, field, a, vein, is, made, up, of, a, vascular, bundle, at, the, core, of, each, bundle, are, clusters, of, two, distinct, types, of, conducting, cells, the, xylem, typically, lies, on, the, adaxial, side, of, the, vascular, bundle, and, the, phloem, typically, lies, on, the, abaxial, side, both, are, embedded, in, a, dense, parenchyma, tissue, called, the, sheath, which, usually, includes, some, structural, collenchyma, tissue, according, to, agnes, arber, s, partial, shoot, theory, of, the, leaf, leaves, are, partial, shoots, being, derived, from, leaf, primordia, of, the, shoot, apex, early, in, development, they, are, dorsiventrally, flattened, with, both, dorsal, and, ventral, surfaces, compound, leaves, are, closer, to, shoots, than, simple, leaves, developmental, studies, have, shown, that, compound, leaves, like, shoots, may, branch, in, three, dimensions, on, the, basis, of, molecular, genetics, eckardt, and, baum, 2010, concluded, that, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, compound, leaves, express, both, leaf, and, shoot, properties, many, dicotyledonous, leaves, show, endogenously, driven, daily, rhythmicity, in, growth, plants, respond, and, adapt, to, environmental, factors, such, as, light, and, mechanical, stress, from, wind, leaves, need, to, support, their, own, mass, and, align, themselves, in, such, a, way, as, to, optimize, their, exposure, to, the, sun, generally, more, or, less, horizontally, however, horizontal, alignment, maximizes, exposure, to, bending, forces, and, failure, from, stresses, such, as, wind, snow, hail, falling, debris, animals, and, abrasion, from, surrounding, foliage, and, plant, structures, overall, leaves, are, relatively, flimsy, with, regard, to, other, plant, structures, such, as, stems, branches, and, roots, both, leaf, blade, and, petiole, structure, influence, the, leaf, s, response, to, forces, such, as, wind, allowing, a, degree, of, repositioning, to, minimize, drag, and, damage, as, opposed, to, resistance, leaf, movement, like, this, may, also, increase, turbulence, of, the, air, close, to, the, surface, of, the, leaf, which, thins, the, boundary, layer, of, air, immediately, adjacent, to, the, surface, increasing, the, capacity, for, gas, and, heat, exchange, as, well, as, photosynthesis, strong, wind, forces, may, result, in, diminished, leaf, number, and, surface, area, which, while, reducing, drag, involves, a, trade, off, of, also, reducing, photosynthesis, thus, leaf, design, may, involve, compromise, between, carbon, gain, thermoregulation, and, water, loss, on, the, one, hand, and, the, cost, of, sustaining, both, static, and, dynamic, loads, in, vascular, plants, perpendicular, forces, are, spread, over, a, larger, area, and, are, relatively, flexible, in, both, bending, and, torsion, enabling, elastic, deforming, without, damage, many, leaves, rely, on, hydrostatic, support, arranged, around, a, skeleton, of, vascular, tissue, for, their, strength, which, depends, on, maintaining, leaf, water, status, both, the, mechanics, and, architecture, of, the, leaf, reflect, the, need, for, transportation, and, support, read, and, stokes, 2006, consider, two, basic, models, the, hydrostatic, and, i, beam, leaf, form, see, fig, 1, hydrostatic, leaves, such, as, in, prostanthera, lasianthos, are, large, and, thin, and, may, involve, the, need, for, multiple, leaves, rather, single, large, leaves, because, of, the, amount, of, veins, needed, to, support, the, periphery, of, large, leaves, but, large, leaf, size, favors, efficiency, in, photosynthesis, and, water, conservation, involving, further, trade, offs, on, the, other, hand, i, beam, leaves, such, as, banksia, marginata, involve, specialized, structures, to, stiffen, them, these, i, beams, are, formed, from, bundle, sheath, extensions, of, sclerenchyma, meeting, stiffened, sub, epidermal, layers, this, shifts, the, balance, from, reliance, on, hydrostatic, pressure, to, structural, support, an, obvious, advantage, where, water, is, relatively, scarce, long, narrow, leaves, bend, more, easily, than, ovate, leaf, blades, of, the, same, area, monocots, typically, have, such, linear, leaves, that, maximize, surface, area, while, minimising, self, shading, in, these, a, high, proportion, of, longitudinal, main, veins, provide, additional, support, although, not, as, nutritious, as, other, organs, such, as, fruit, leaves, provide, a, food, source, for, many, organisms, the, leaf, is, a, vital, source, of, energy, production, for, the, plant, and, plants, have, evolved, protection, against, animals, that, consume, leaves, such, as, tannins, chemicals, which, hinder, the, digestion, of, proteins, and, have, an, unpleasant, taste, animals, that, are, specialized, to, eat, leaves, are, known, as, folivores, some, species, have, cryptic, adaptations, by, which, they, use, leaves, in, avoiding, predators, for, example, the, caterpillars, of, some, leaf, roller, moths, will, create, a, small, home, in, the, leaf, by, folding, it, over, themselves, some, sawflies, similarly, roll, the, leaves, of, their, food, plants, into, tubes, females, of, the, attelabidae, so, called, leaf, rolling, weevils, lay, their, eggs, into, leaves, that, they, then, roll, up, as, means, of, protection, other, herbivores, and, their, predators, mimic, the, appearance, of, the, leaf, reptiles, such, as, some, chameleons, and, insects, such, as, some, katydids, also, mimic, the, oscillating, movements, of, leaves, in, the, wind, moving, from, side, to, side, or, back, and, forth, while, evading, a, possible, threat, leaves, in, temperate, boreal, and, seasonally, dry, zones, may, be, seasonally, deciduous, falling, off, or, dying, for, the, inclement, season, this, mechanism, to, shed, leaves, is, called, abscission, when, the, leaf, is, shed, it, leaves, a, leaf, scar, on, the, twig, in, cold, autumns, they, sometimes, change, color, and, turn, yellow, bright, orange, or, red, as, various, accessory, pigments, carotenoids, and, xanthophylls, are, revealed, when, the, tree, responds, to, cold, and, reduced, sunlight, by, curtailing, chlorophyll, production, red, anthocyanin, pigments, are, now, thought, to, be, produced, in, the, leaf, as, it, dies, possibly, to, mask, the, yellow, hue, left, when, the, chlorophyll, is, lost, yellow, leaves, appear, to, attract, herbivores, such, as, aphids, optical, masking, of, chlorophyll, by, anthocyanins, reduces, risk, of, photo, oxidative, damage, to, leaf, cells, as, they, senesce, which, otherwise, may, lower, the, efficiency, of, nutrient, retrieval, from, senescing, autumn, leaves, in, the, course, of, evolution, leaves, have, adapted, to, different, environments, in, the, following, ways, the, edge, or, margin, is, the, outside, perimeter, of, a, leaf, the, terms, are, interchangeable, may, be, coarsely, dentate, having, large, teeth, or, glandular, dentate, having, teeth, which, bear, glands, the, leaf, surface, is, also, host, to, a, large, variety, of, microorganisms, in, this, context, it, is, referred, to, as, the, phyllosphere, hairs, on, plants, are, properly, called, trichomes, leaves, can, show, several, degrees, of, hairiness, the, meaning, of, several, of, the, following, terms, can, overlap, a, number, of, different, classification, systems, of, the, patterns, of, leaf, veins, venation, or, veination, have, been, described, starting, with, ettingshausen, 1861, together, with, many, different, descriptive, terms, and, the, terminology, has, been, described, as, formidable, one, of, the, commonest, among, these, is, the, hickey, system, originally, developed, for, dicotyledons, and, using, a, number, of, ettingshausen, s, terms, derived, from, greek, 1973, 1979, see, also, simpson, figure, 9, 12, p, 468, these, in, turn, have, a, number, of, further, subtypes, such, as, eucamptodromous, where, secondary, veins, curve, near, the, margin, without, joining, adjacent, secondary, veins, types, 4, 6, may, similarly, be, subclassified, as, basal, primaries, joined, at, the, base, of, the, blade, or, suprabasal, diverging, above, the, blade, base, and, perfect, or, imperfect, but, also, flabellate, at, about, the, same, time, melville, 1976, described, a, system, applicable, to, all, angiosperms, and, using, latin, and, english, terminology, melville, also, had, six, divisions, based, on, the, order, in, which, veins, develop, a, modified, form, of, the, hickey, system, was, later, incorporated, into, the, smithsonian, classification, 1999, which, proposed, seven, main, types, of, venation, based, on, the, architecture, of, the, primary, veins, adding, flabellate, as, an, additional, main, type, further, classification, was, then, made, on, the, basis, of, secondary, veins, with, 12, further, types, such, as, terms, which, had, been, used, as, subtypes, in, the, original, hickey, system, further, descriptions, included, the, higher, order, or, minor, veins, and, the, patterns, of, areoles, see, leaf, architecture, working, group, figures, 28, 29, analyses, of, vein, patterns, often, fall, into, consideration, of, the, vein, orders, primary, vein, type, secondary, vein, type, major, veins, and, minor, vein, density, a, number, of, authors, have, adopted, simplified, versions, of, these, schemes, at, its, simplest, the, primary, vein, types, can, be, considered, in, three, or, four, groups, depending, on, the, plant, divisions, being, considered, where, palmate, refers, to, multiple, primary, veins, that, radiate, from, the, petiole, as, opposed, to, branching, from, the, central, main, vein, in, the, pinnate, form, and, encompasses, both, of, hickey, types, 4, and, 5, which, are, preserved, as, subtypes, e, g, palmate, acrodromous, see, national, park, service, leaf, guide, alternatively, simpson, uses, however, these, simplified, systems, allow, for, further, division, into, multiple, subtypes, simpson, and, others, divides, parallel, and, netted, and, some, use, only, these, two, terms, for, angiosperms, on, the, basis, of, the, number, of, primary, veins, costa, as, follows, these, complex, systems, are, not, used, much, in, morphological, descriptions, of, taxa, but, have, usefulness, in, plant, identification, although, criticized, as, being, unduly, burdened, with, jargon, an, older, even, simpler, system, used, in, some, flora, uses, only, two, categories, open, and, closed, there, are, also, many, other, descriptive, terms, often, with, very, specialized, usage, and, confined, to, specific, taxonomic, groups, the, conspicuousness, of, veins, depends, on, a, number, of, features, these, include, the, width, of, the, veins, their, prominence, in, relation, to, the, lamina, surface, and, the, degree, of, opacity, of, the, surface, which, may, hide, finer, veins, in, this, regard, veins, are, called, obscure, and, the, order, of, veins, that, are, obscured, and, whether, upper, lower, or, both, surfaces, further, specified, terms, that, describe, vein, prominence, include, bullate, channelled, flat, guttered, impressed, prominent, and, recessed, fig, 6, 1, hawthorne, lawrence, 2013, veins, may, show, different, types, of, prominence, in, different, areas, of, the, leaf, for, instance, pimenta, racemosa, has, a, channelled, midrib, on, the, upper, surface, but, this, is, prominent, on, the, lower, surface, describing, vein, prominence, describing, other, features, the, terms, megaphyll, macrophyll, mesophyll, notophyll, microphyll, nanophyll, and, leptophyll, are, used, to, describe, leaf, sizes, in, descending, order, in, a, classification, devised, in, 1934, by, christen, c, raunki, r, and, since, modified, by, others
