a, diatom, neo, latin, diatoma, is, any, member, of, a, large, group, comprising, several, genera, of, algae, specifically, microalgae, found, in, the, oceans, waterways, and, soils, of, the, world, living, diatoms, make, up, a, significant, portion, of, the, earth, s, biomass, they, generate, about, 20, to, 50, percent, of, the, oxygen, produced, on, the, planet, each, year, take, in, over, 6, 7, billion, tonnes, of, silicon, each, year, from, the, waters, in, which, they, live, and, constitute, nearly, half, of, the, organic, material, found, in, the, oceans, the, shells, of, dead, diatoms, can, reach, as, much, as, a, half, mile, 800, m, deep, on, the, ocean, floor, and, the, entire, amazon, basin, is, fertilized, annually, by, 27, million, tons, of, diatom, shell, dust, transported, by, transatlantic, winds, from, the, african, sahara, much, of, it, from, the, bod, l, depression, which, was, once, made, up, of, a, system, of, fresh, water, lakes, diatoms, are, unicellular, organisms, they, occur, either, as, solitary, cells, or, in, colonies, which, can, take, the, shape, of, ribbons, fans, zigzags, or, stars, individual, cells, range, in, size, from, 2, to, 2000, micrometers, in, the, presence, of, adequate, nutrients, and, sunlight, an, assemblage, of, living, diatoms, doubles, approximately, every, 24, hours, by, asexual, multiple, fission, the, maximum, life, span, of, individual, cells, is, about, six, days, diatoms, have, two, distinct, shapes, a, few, centric, diatoms, are, radially, symmetric, while, most, pennate, diatoms, are, broadly, bilaterally, symmetric, the, unique, feature, of, diatoms, is, that, they, are, surrounded, by, a, cell, wall, made, of, silica, hydrated, silicon, dioxide, called, a, frustule, these, frustules, produce, structural, coloration, prompting, them, to, be, described, as, jewels, of, the, sea, and, living, opals, movement, in, diatoms, primarily, occurs, passively, as, a, result, of, both, ocean, currents, and, wind, induced, water, turbulence, however, male, gametes, of, centric, diatoms, have, flagella, permitting, active, movement, to, seek, female, gametes, similar, to, plants, diatoms, convert, light, energy, to, chemical, energy, by, photosynthesis, but, their, chloroplasts, were, acquired, in, different, ways, unusually, for, autotrophic, organisms, diatoms, possess, a, urea, cycle, a, feature, that, they, share, with, animals, although, this, cycle, is, used, to, different, metabolic, ends, in, diatoms, the, family, rhopalodiaceae, also, possess, a, cyanobacterial, endosymbiont, called, a, spheroid, body, this, endosymbiont, has, lost, its, photosynthetic, properties, but, has, kept, its, ability, to, perform, nitrogen, fixation, allowing, the, diatom, to, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, other, diatoms, in, symbiosis, with, nitrogen, fixing, cyanobacteria, are, among, the, genera, hemiaulus, rhizosolenia, and, chaetoceros, dinotoms, are, diatoms, that, have, become, endosymbionts, inside, dinoflagellates, research, on, the, dinoflagellates, durinskia, baltica, and, glenodinium, foliaceum, has, shown, that, the, endosymbiont, event, happened, so, recently, evolutionarily, speaking, that, their, organelles, and, genome, are, still, intact, with, minimal, to, no, gene, loss, the, main, difference, between, these, and, free, living, diatoms, is, that, they, have, lost, their, cell, wall, of, silica, making, them, the, only, known, shell, less, diatoms, the, study, of, diatoms, is, a, branch, of, phycology, diatoms, are, classified, as, eukaryotes, organisms, with, a, nuclear, envelope, bound, cell, nucleus, that, separates, them, from, the, prokaryotes, archaea, and, bacteria, diatoms, are, a, type, of, plankton, called, phytoplankton, the, most, common, of, the, plankton, types, diatoms, also, grow, attached, to, benthic, substrates, floating, debris, and, on, macrophytes, they, comprise, an, integral, component, of, the, periphyton, community, another, classification, divides, plankton, into, eight, types, based, on, size, in, this, scheme, diatoms, are, classed, as, microalgae, several, systems, for, classifying, the, individual, diatom, species, exist, fossil, evidence, suggests, that, diatoms, originated, during, or, before, the, early, jurassic, period, which, was, about, 150, to, 200, million, years, ago, the, oldest, fossil, evidence, for, diatoms, is, a, specimen, of, extant, genus, hemiaulus, in, late, jurassic, aged, amber, from, thailand, diatoms, are, used, to, monitor, past, and, present, environmental, conditions, and, are, commonly, used, in, studies, of, water, quality, diatomaceous, earth, diatomite, is, a, collection, of, diatom, shells, found, in, the, earth, s, crust, they, are, soft, silica, containing, sedimentary, rocks, which, are, easily, crumbled, into, a, fine, powder, and, typically, have, a, particle, size, of, 10, to, 200, m, diatomaceous, earth, is, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, including, for, water, filtration, as, a, mild, abrasive, in, cat, litter, and, as, a, dynamite, stabilizer, diatoms, are, protists, that, form, massive, annual, spring, and, fall, blooms, in, aquatic, environments, and, are, estimated, to, be, responsible, for, about, half, of, photosynthesis, in, the, global, oceans, this, predictable, annual, bloom, dynamic, fuels, higher, trophic, levels, and, initiates, delivery, of, carbon, into, the, deep, ocean, biome, diatoms, have, complex, life, history, strategies, that, are, presumed, to, have, contributed, to, their, rapid, genetic, diversification, into, 200, 000, species, that, are, distributed, between, the, two, major, diatom, groups, centrics, and, pennates, diatoms, are, generally, 20, to, 200, micrometers, in, size, with, a, few, larger, species, their, yellowish, brown, chloroplasts, the, site, of, photosynthesis, are, typical, of, heterokonts, having, four, cell, membranes, and, containing, pigments, such, as, the, carotenoid, fucoxanthin, individuals, usually, lack, flagella, but, they, are, present, in, male, gametes, of, the, centric, diatoms, and, have, the, usual, heterokont, structure, including, the, hairs, mastigonemes, characteristic, in, other, groups, diatoms, are, often, referred, as, jewels, of, the, sea, or, living, opals, due, to, their, optical, properties, the, biological, function, of, this, structural, coloration, is, not, clear, but, it, is, speculated, that, it, may, be, related, to, communication, camouflage, thermal, exchange, and, or, uv, protection, diatoms, build, intricate, hard, but, porous, cell, walls, called, frustules, composed, primarily, of, silica, 25, 30, this, siliceous, wall, can, be, highly, patterned, with, a, variety, of, pores, ribs, minute, spines, marginal, ridges, and, elevations, all, of, which, can, be, used, to, delineate, genera, and, species, the, cell, itself, consists, of, two, halves, each, containing, an, essentially, flat, plate, or, valve, and, marginal, connecting, or, girdle, band, one, half, the, hypotheca, is, slightly, smaller, than, the, other, half, the, epitheca, diatom, morphology, varies, although, the, shape, of, the, cell, is, typically, circular, some, cells, may, be, triangular, square, or, elliptical, their, distinguishing, feature, is, a, hard, mineral, shell, or, frustule, composed, of, opal, hydrated, polymerized, silicic, acid, diatoms, are, divided, into, two, groups, that, are, distinguished, by, the, shape, of, the, frustule, the, centric, diatoms, and, the, pennate, diatoms, pennate, diatoms, are, bilaterally, symmetric, each, one, of, their, valves, have, openings, that, are, slits, along, the, raphes, and, their, shells, are, typically, elongated, parallel, to, these, raphes, they, generate, cell, movement, through, cytoplasm, that, streams, along, the, raphes, always, moving, along, solid, surfaces, centric, diatoms, are, radially, symmetric, they, are, composed, of, upper, and, lower, valves, epitheca, and, hypotheca, each, consisting, of, a, valve, and, a, girdle, band, that, can, easily, slide, underneath, each, other, and, expand, to, increase, cell, content, over, the, diatoms, progression, the, cytoplasm, of, the, centric, diatom, is, located, along, the, inner, surface, of, the, shell, and, provides, a, hollow, lining, around, the, large, vacuole, located, in, the, center, of, the, cell, this, large, central, vacuole, is, filled, by, a, fluid, known, as, cell, sap, which, is, similar, to, seawater, but, varies, with, specific, ion, content, the, cytoplasmic, layer, is, home, to, several, organelles, like, the, chloroplasts, and, mitochondria, before, the, centric, diatom, begins, to, expand, its, nucleus, is, at, the, center, of, one, of, the, valves, and, begins, to, move, towards, the, center, of, the, cytoplasmic, layer, before, division, is, complete, centric, diatoms, have, a, variety, of, shapes, and, sizes, depending, on, from, which, axis, the, shell, extends, and, if, spines, are, present, diatom, cells, are, contained, within, a, unique, silica, cell, wall, known, as, a, frustule, made, up, of, two, valves, called, thecae, that, typically, overlap, one, another, the, biogenic, silica, composing, the, cell, wall, is, synthesised, intracellularly, by, the, polymerisation, of, silicic, acid, monomers, this, material, is, then, extruded, to, the, cell, exterior, and, added, to, the, wall, in, most, species, when, a, diatom, divides, to, produce, two, daughter, cells, each, cell, keeps, one, of, the, two, halves, and, grows, a, smaller, half, within, it, as, a, result, after, each, division, cycle, the, average, size, of, diatom, cells, in, the, population, gets, smaller, once, such, cells, reach, a, certain, minimum, size, rather, than, simply, divide, they, reverse, this, decline, by, forming, an, auxospore, usually, through, meiosis, and, sexual, reproduction, but, exceptions, exist, the, auxospore, expands, in, size, to, give, rise, to, a, much, larger, cell, which, then, returns, to, size, diminishing, divisions, the, exact, mechanism, of, transferring, silica, absorbed, by, the, diatom, to, the, cell, wall, is, unknown, much, of, the, sequencing, of, diatom, genes, comes, from, the, search, for, the, mechanism, of, silica, uptake, and, deposition, in, nano, scale, patterns, in, the, frustule, the, most, success, in, this, area, has, come, from, two, species, thalassiosira, pseudonana, which, has, become, the, model, species, as, the, whole, genome, was, sequenced, and, methods, for, genetic, control, were, established, and, cylindrotheca, fusiformis, in, which, the, important, silica, deposition, proteins, silaffins, were, first, discovered, silaffins, sets, of, polycationic, peptides, were, found, in, c, fusiformis, cell, walls, and, can, generate, intricate, silica, structures, these, structures, demonstrated, pores, of, sizes, characteristic, to, diatom, patterns, when, t, pseudonana, underwent, genome, analysis, it, was, found, that, it, encoded, a, urea, cycle, including, a, higher, number, of, polyamines, than, most, genomes, as, well, as, three, distinct, silica, transport, genes, in, a, phylogenetic, study, on, silica, transport, genes, from, 8, diverse, groups, of, diatoms, silica, transport, was, found, to, generally, group, with, species, this, study, also, found, structural, differences, between, the, silica, transporters, of, pennate, bilateral, symmetry, and, centric, radial, symmetry, diatoms, the, sequences, compared, in, this, study, were, used, to, create, a, diverse, background, in, order, to, identify, residues, that, differentiate, function, in, the, silica, deposition, process, additionally, the, same, study, found, that, a, number, of, the, regions, were, conserved, within, species, likely, the, base, structure, of, silica, transport, these, silica, transport, proteins, are, unique, to, diatoms, with, no, homologs, found, in, other, species, such, as, sponges, or, rice, the, divergence, of, these, silica, transport, genes, is, also, indicative, of, the, structure, of, the, protein, evolving, from, two, repeated, units, composed, of, five, membrane, bound, segments, which, indicates, either, gene, duplication, or, dimerization, the, silica, deposition, that, takes, place, from, the, membrane, bound, vesicle, in, diatoms, has, been, hypothesized, to, be, a, result, of, the, activity, of, silaffins, and, long, chain, polyamines, this, silica, deposition, vesicle, sdv, has, been, characterized, as, an, acidic, compartment, fused, with, golgi, derived, vesicles, these, two, protein, structures, have, been, shown, to, create, sheets, of, patterned, silica, in, vivo, with, irregular, pores, on, the, scale, of, diatom, frustules, one, hypothesis, as, to, how, these, proteins, work, to, create, complex, structure, is, that, residues, are, conserved, within, the, sdv, s, which, is, unfortunately, difficult, to, identify, or, observe, due, to, the, limited, number, of, diverse, sequences, available, though, the, exact, mechanism, of, the, highly, uniform, deposition, of, silica, is, as, yet, unknown, the, thalassiosira, pseudonana, genes, linked, to, silaffins, are, being, looked, to, as, targets, for, genetic, control, of, nanoscale, silica, deposition, the, ability, of, diatoms, to, make, silica, based, cell, walls, has, been, the, subject, of, fascination, for, centuries, it, started, with, a, microscopic, observation, by, an, anonymous, english, country, nobleman, in, 1703, who, observed, an, object, that, looked, like, a, chain, of, regular, parallelograms, and, debated, whether, it, was, just, crystals, of, salt, or, a, plant, the, viewer, decided, that, it, was, a, plant, because, the, parallelograms, didn, t, separate, upon, agitation, nor, did, they, vary, in, appearance, when, dried, or, subjected, to, warm, water, in, an, attempt, to, dissolve, the, salt, unknowingly, the, viewer, s, confusion, captured, the, essence, of, diatoms, mineral, utilizing, plants, it, is, not, clear, when, it, was, determined, that, diatom, cell, walls, are, made, of, silica, but, in, 1939, a, seminal, reference, characterized, the, material, as, silicic, acid, in, a, subcolloidal, state, identification, of, the, main, chemical, component, of, the, cell, wall, spurred, investigations, into, how, it, was, made, these, investigations, have, involved, and, been, propelled, by, diverse, approaches, including, microscopy, chemistry, biochemistry, material, characterisation, molecular, biology, omics, and, transgenic, approaches, the, results, from, this, work, have, given, a, better, understanding, of, cell, wall, formation, processes, establishing, fundamental, knowledge, which, can, be, used, to, create, models, that, contextualise, current, findings, and, clarify, how, the, process, works, the, process, of, building, a, mineral, based, cell, wall, inside, the, cell, then, exporting, it, outside, is, a, massive, event, that, must, involve, large, numbers, of, genes, and, their, protein, products, the, act, of, building, and, exocytosing, this, large, structural, object, in, a, short, time, period, synched, with, cell, cycle, progression, necessitates, substantial, physical, movements, within, the, cell, as, well, as, dedication, of, a, significant, proportion, of, the, cell, s, biosynthetic, capacities, the, first, characterisations, of, the, biochemical, processes, and, components, involved, in, diatom, silicification, were, made, in, the, late, 1990s, these, were, followed, by, insights, into, how, higher, order, assembly, of, silica, structures, might, occur, more, recent, reports, describe, the, identification, of, novel, components, involved, in, higher, order, processes, the, dynamics, documented, through, real, time, imaging, and, the, genetic, manipulation, of, silica, structure, the, approaches, established, in, these, recent, works, provide, practical, avenues, to, not, only, identify, the, components, involved, in, silica, cell, wall, formation, but, to, elucidate, their, interactions, and, spatio, temporal, dynamics, this, type, of, holistic, understanding, will, be, necessary, to, achieve, a, more, complete, understanding, of, cell, wall, synthesis, most, centric, and, araphid, pennate, diatoms, are, nonmotile, and, their, relatively, dense, cell, walls, cause, them, to, readily, sink, planktonic, forms, in, open, water, usually, rely, on, turbulent, mixing, of, the, upper, layers, of, the, oceanic, waters, by, the, wind, to, keep, them, suspended, in, sunlit, surface, waters, many, planktonic, diatoms, have, also, evolved, features, that, slow, their, sinking, rate, such, as, spines, or, the, ability, to, grow, in, colonial, chains, these, adaptations, increase, their, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, and, drag, allowing, them, to, stay, suspended, in, the, water, column, longer, individual, cells, may, regulate, buoyancy, via, an, ionic, pump, some, pennate, diatoms, are, capable, of, a, type, of, locomotion, called, gliding, which, allows, them, to, move, across, surfaces, via, adhesive, mucilage, secreted, through, a, seamlike, structure, called, the, raphe, in, order, for, a, diatom, cell, to, glide, it, must, have, a, solid, substrate, for, the, mucilage, to, adhere, to, cells, are, solitary, or, united, into, colonies, of, various, kinds, which, may, be, linked, by, siliceous, structures, mucilage, pads, stalks, or, tubes, amorphous, masses, of, mucilage, or, by, threads, of, chitin, polysaccharide, which, are, secreted, through, strutted, processes, of, the, cell, reproduction, among, these, organisms, is, asexual, by, binary, fission, during, which, the, diatom, divides, into, two, parts, producing, two, new, diatoms, with, identical, genes, each, new, organism, receives, one, of, the, two, frustules, one, larger, the, other, smaller, possessed, by, the, parent, which, is, now, called, the, epitheca, and, is, used, to, construct, a, second, smaller, frustule, the, hypotheca, the, diatom, that, received, the, larger, frustule, becomes, the, same, size, as, its, parent, but, the, diatom, that, received, the, smaller, frustule, remains, smaller, than, its, parent, this, causes, the, average, cell, size, of, this, diatom, population, to, decrease, it, has, been, observed, however, that, certain, taxa, have, the, ability, to, divide, without, causing, a, reduction, in, cell, size, nonetheless, in, order, to, restore, the, cell, size, of, a, diatom, population, for, those, that, do, endure, size, reduction, sexual, reproduction, and, auxospore, formation, must, occur, vegetative, cells, of, diatoms, are, diploid, 2n, and, so, meiosis, can, take, place, producing, male, and, female, gametes, which, then, fuse, to, form, the, zygote, the, zygote, sheds, its, silica, theca, and, grows, into, a, large, sphere, covered, by, an, organic, membrane, the, auxospore, a, new, diatom, cell, of, maximum, size, the, initial, cell, forms, within, the, auxospore, thus, beginning, a, new, generation, resting, spores, may, also, be, formed, as, a, response, to, unfavourable, environmental, conditions, with, germination, occurring, when, conditions, improve, a, defining, characteristic, of, all, diatoms, is, their, restrictive, and, bipartite, silica, cell, wall, that, causes, them, to, progressively, shrink, during, asexual, cell, division, at, a, critically, small, cell, size, and, under, certain, conditions, auxosporulation, restitutes, cell, size, and, prevents, clonal, death, the, entire, lifecycles, of, only, a, few, diatoms, have, been, described, and, rarely, have, sexual, events, been, captured, in, the, environment, most, eukaryotes, are, capable, of, sexual, reproduction, involving, meiosis, sexual, reproduction, appears, to, be, an, obligatory, phase, in, the, life, cycle, of, diatoms, particularly, as, cell, size, decreases, with, successive, vegetative, divisions, sexual, reproduction, involves, production, of, gametes, and, the, fusion, of, gametes, to, form, a, zygote, in, which, maximal, cell, size, is, restored, the, signaling, that, triggers, the, sexual, phase, is, favored, when, cells, accumulate, together, so, that, the, distance, between, them, is, reduced, and, the, contacts, and, or, the, perception, of, chemical, cues, is, facilitated, an, exploration, of, the, genomes, of, five, diatoms, and, one, diatom, transcriptome, led, to, the, identification, of, 42, genes, potentially, involved, in, meiosis, thus, a, meiotic, toolkit, appears, to, be, conserved, in, these, six, diatom, species, indicating, a, central, role, of, meiosis, in, diatoms, as, in, other, eukaryotes, diatoms, are, mostly, non, motile, however, sperm, found, in, some, species, can, be, flagellated, though, motility, is, usually, limited, to, a, gliding, motion, in, centric, diatoms, the, small, male, gametes, have, one, flagellum, while, the, female, gametes, are, large, and, non, motile, oogamous, conversely, in, pennate, diatoms, both, gametes, lack, flagella, isogamous, certain, araphid, species, that, is, pennate, diatoms, without, a, raphe, seam, have, been, documented, as, anisogamous, and, are, therefore, considered, to, represent, a, transitional, stage, between, centric, and, raphid, pennate, diatoms, diatoms, with, a, raphe, certain, species, of, bacteria, in, oceans, and, lakes, can, accelerate, the, rate, of, dissolution, of, silica, in, dead, and, living, diatoms, by, using, hydrolytic, enzymes, to, break, down, the, organic, algal, material, diatoms, are, a, widespread, group, and, can, be, found, in, the, oceans, in, fresh, water, in, soils, and, on, damp, surfaces, they, are, one, of, the, dominant, components, of, phytoplankton, in, nutrient, rich, coastal, waters, and, during, oceanic, spring, blooms, since, they, can, divide, more, rapidly, than, other, groups, of, phytoplankton, most, live, pelagically, in, open, water, although, some, live, as, surface, films, at, the, water, sediment, interface, benthic, or, even, under, damp, atmospheric, conditions, they, are, especially, important, in, oceans, where, a, 2003, study, found, that, they, contribute, an, estimated, 45, of, the, total, oceanic, primary, production, of, organic, material, however, a, more, recent, 2016, study, estimates, that, the, number, is, closer, to, 20, spatial, distribution, of, marine, phytoplankton, species, is, restricted, both, horizontally, and, vertically, planktonic, diatoms, in, freshwater, and, marine, environments, typically, exhibit, a, boom, and, bust, or, bloom, and, bust, lifestyle, when, conditions, in, the, upper, mixed, layer, nutrients, and, light, are, favourable, as, at, the, spring, their, competitive, edge, and, rapid, growth, rate, enables, them, to, dominate, phytoplankton, communities, boom, or, bloom, as, such, they, are, often, classed, as, opportunistic, r, strategists, i, e, those, organisms, whose, ecology, is, defined, by, a, high, growth, rate, r, the, freshwater, diatom, didymosphenia, geminata, commonly, known, as, didymo, causes, severe, environmental, degradation, in, water, courses, where, it, blooms, producing, large, quantities, of, a, brown, jelly, like, material, called, brown, snot, or, rock, snot, this, diatom, is, native, to, europe, and, is, an, invasive, species, both, in, the, antipodes, and, in, parts, of, north, america, the, problem, is, most, frequently, recorded, from, australia, and, new, zealand, when, conditions, turn, unfavourable, usually, upon, depletion, of, nutrients, diatom, cells, typically, increase, in, sinking, rate, and, exit, the, upper, mixed, layer, bust, this, sinking, is, induced, by, either, a, loss, of, buoyancy, control, the, synthesis, of, mucilage, that, sticks, diatoms, cells, together, or, the, production, of, heavy, resting, spores, sinking, out, of, the, upper, mixed, layer, removes, diatoms, from, conditions, unfavourable, to, growth, including, grazer, populations, and, higher, temperatures, which, would, otherwise, increase, cell, metabolism, cells, reaching, deeper, water, or, the, shallow, seafloor, can, then, rest, until, conditions, become, more, favourable, again, in, the, open, ocean, many, sinking, cells, are, lost, to, the, deep, but, refuge, populations, can, persist, near, the, thermocline, ultimately, diatom, cells, in, these, resting, populations, re, enter, the, upper, mixed, layer, when, vertical, mixing, entrains, them, in, most, circumstances, this, mixing, also, replenishes, nutrients, in, the, upper, mixed, layer, setting, the, scene, for, the, next, round, of, diatom, blooms, in, the, open, ocean, away, from, areas, of, continuous, upwelling, this, cycle, of, bloom, bust, then, return, to, pre, bloom, conditions, typically, occurs, over, an, annual, cycle, with, diatoms, only, being, prevalent, during, the, spring, and, early, summer, in, some, locations, however, an, autumn, bloom, may, occur, caused, by, the, breakdown, of, summer, stratification, and, the, entrainment, of, nutrients, while, light, levels, are, still, sufficient, for, growth, since, vertical, mixing, is, increasing, and, light, levels, are, falling, as, winter, approaches, these, blooms, are, smaller, and, shorter, lived, than, their, spring, equivalents, in, the, open, ocean, the, diatom, spring, bloom, is, typically, ended, by, a, shortage, of, silicon, unlike, other, minerals, the, requirement, for, silicon, is, unique, to, diatoms, and, it, is, not, regenerated, in, the, plankton, ecosystem, as, efficiently, as, for, instance, nitrogen, or, phosphorus, nutrients, this, can, be, seen, in, maps, of, surface, nutrient, concentrations, as, nutrients, decline, along, gradients, silicon, is, usually, the, first, to, be, exhausted, followed, normally, by, nitrogen, then, phosphorus, because, of, this, bloom, and, bust, cycle, diatoms, are, believed, to, play, a, disproportionately, important, role, in, the, export, of, carbon, from, oceanic, surface, waters, see, also, the, biological, pump, significantly, they, also, play, a, key, role, in, the, regulation, of, the, biogeochemical, cycle, of, silicon, in, the, modern, ocean, diatoms, are, ecologically, successful, and, occur, in, virtually, every, environment, that, contains, water, not, only, oceans, seas, lakes, and, streams, but, also, soil, and, wetlands, the, use, of, silicon, by, diatoms, is, believed, by, many, researchers, to, be, the, key, to, this, ecological, success, raven, 1983, noted,

overall, cell, energy, budget, in, a, now, classic, study, egge, and, aksnes, 1992, found, that, diatom, dominance, of, mesocosm, communities, was, directly, related, to, the, availability, of, silicic, acid, when, concentrations, were, greater, than, 2, mol, m, 3, they, found, that, diatoms, typically, represented, more, than, 70, of, the, phytoplankton, community, other, researchers, have, suggested, that, the, biogenic, silica, in, diatom, cell, walls, acts, as, an, effective, ph, buffering, agent, facilitating, the, conversion, of, bicarbonate, to, dissolved, co, 2, which, is, more, readily, assimilated, more, generally, notwithstanding, these, possible, advantages, conferred, by, their, use, of, silicon, diatoms, typically, have, higher, growth, rates, than, other, algae, of,

the, last, 100, my, it, is, thought, that, the, silicon, cycle, has, come, under, even, tighter, control, and, that, this, derives, from, the, ecological, ascendancy, of, the, diatoms, however, the, precise, timing, of, the, take, over, remains, unclear, and, different, authors, have, conflicting, interpretations, of, the, fossil, record, some, evidence, such, as, the, displacement, of, siliceous, sponges, from, the, shelves, suggests, that, this, takeover, began, in, the, cretaceous, 146, ma, to, 66, ma, while, evidence, from, radiolarians, suggests, take, over, did, not, begin,

thousands, of, years, or, longer, the, remaining, organic, matter, is, remineralized, through, respiration, thus, diatoms, are, one, of, the, main, players, in, this, biological, carbon, pump, which, is, arguably, the, most, important, biological, mechanism, in, the, earth, system, allowing, co, 2, to, be, removed, from, the, carbon, cycle, for, very, long, period, a, feature, of, diatoms, is, the, urea, cycle, which, links, them, evolutionarily, to, animals, in, 2011, allen, et, al, established, that, diatoms, have, a, functioning, urea, cycle, this, result, was, significant, since, prior, to, this, the, urea, cycle, was, thought, to, have, originated, with, the, metazoans, which, appeared, several, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, before, the, diatoms, their, study, demonstrated, that, while, diatoms, and, animals, use, the, urea, cycle, for, different, ends, they, are, seen, to, be, evolutionarily, linked, in, such, a, way, that, animals, and, plants, are, not, while, often, overlooked, in, photosynthetic, organisms, the, mitochondria, also, play, critical, roles, in, energy, balance, two, nitrogen, related, pathways, are, relevant, and, they, may, also, change, under, ammonium, nh, 4, nutrition, compared, with, nitrate, no, 3, nutrition, first, in, diatoms, and, likely, some, other, algae, there, is, a, urea, cycle, the, long, known, function, of, the, urea, cycle, in, animals, is, to, excrete, excess, nitrogen, produced, by, amino, acid, catabolism, like, photorespiration, the, urea, cycle, had, long, been, considered, a, waste, pathway, however, in, diatoms, the, urea, cycle, appears, to, play, a, role, in, exchange, of, nutrients, between, the, mitochondria, and, the, cytoplasm, and, potentially, the, plastid, and, may, help, to, regulate, ammonium, metabolism, because, of, this, cycle, marine, diatoms, in, contrast, to, chlorophytes, also, have, acquired, a, mitochondrial, urea, transporter, and, in, fact, based, on, bioinformatics, a, complete, mitochondrial, gs, gogat, cycle, has, been, hypothesised, diatoms, are, mainly, photosynthetic, however, a, few, are, obligate, heterotrophs, and, can, live, in, the, absence, of, light, provided, an, appropriate, organic, carbon, source, is, available, photosynthetic, diatoms, that, find, themselves, in, an, environment, absent, of, oxygen, and, or, sunlight, can, switch, to, anaerobic, respiration, known, as, nitrate, respiration, dnra, and, stay, dormant, for, up, till, months, and, decades, major, pigments, of, diatoms, are, chlorophylls, a, and, c, beta, carotene, fucoxanthin, diatoxanthin, and, diadinoxanthin, diatoms, belong, to, a, large, group, of, protists, many, of, which, contain, plastids, rich, in, chlorophylls, a, and, c, the, group, has, been, variously, referred, to, as, heterokonts, chrysophytes, chromists, or, stramenopiles, many, are, autotrophs, such, as, golden, algae, and, kelp, and, heterotrophs, such, as, water, moulds, opalinids, and, actinophryid, heliozoa, the, classification, of, this, area, of, protists, is, still, unsettled, in, terms, of, rank, they, have, been, treated, as, a, division, phylum, kingdom, or, something, intermediate, to, those, consequently, diatoms, are, ranked, anywhere, from, a, class, usually, called, diatomophyceae, or, bacillariophyceae, to, a, division, phylum, usually, called, bacillariophyta, with, corresponding, changes, in, the, ranks, of, their, subgroups, an, estimated, 20, 000, extant, diatom, species, are, believed, to, exist, of, which, around, 12, 000, have, been, named, to, date, according, to, guiry, 2012, other, sources, give, a, wider, range, of, estimates, around, 1, 000, 1, 300, diatom, genera, have, been, described, both, extant, and, fossil, of, which, some, 250, 300, exist, only, as, fossils, for, many, years, the, diatoms, treated, either, as, a, class, bacillariophyceae, or, a, phylum, bacillariophyta, were, divided, into, just, 2, orders, corresponding, to, the, centric, and, the, pennate, diatoms, centrales, and, pennales, this, classification, was, extensively, overhauled, by, round, crawford, and, mann, in, 1990, who, treated, the, diatoms, at, a, higher, rank, division, corresponding, to, phylum, in, zoological, classification, and, promoted, the, major, classification, units, to, classes, maintaining, the, centric, diatoms, as, a, single, class, coscinodiscophyceae, but, splitting, the, former, pennate, diatoms, into, 2, separate, classes, fragilariophyceae, and, bacillariophyceae, the, latter, older, name, retained, but, with, an, emended, definition, between, them, encompassing, 45, orders, the, majority, of, them, new, today, writing, at, mid, 2020, it, is, recognised, that, the, 1990, system, of, round, et, al, is, in, need, of, revision, with, the, advent, of, newer, molecular, work, however, the, best, system, to, replace, it, is, unclear, and, current, systems, in, widespread, use, such, as, algaebase, the, world, register, of, marine, species, and, its, contributing, database, diatombase, and, the, system, for, all, life, represented, in, ruggiero, et, al, 2015, all, retain, the, round, et, al, treatment, as, their, basis, albeit, with, diatoms, as, a, whole, treated, as, a, class, rather, than, division, phylum, and, round, et, al, s, classes, reduced, to, subclasses, for, better, agreement, with, the, treatment, of, phylogenetically, adjacent, groups, and, their, containing, taxa, for, references, refer, the, individual, sections, below, one, proposal, by, linda, medlin, and, co, workers, commencing, in, 2004, is, for, some, of, the, centric, diatom, orders, considered, more, closely, related, to, the, pennates, to, be, split, off, as, a, new, class, mediophyceae, itself, more, closely, aligned, with, the, pennate, diatoms, than, the, remaining, centrics, this, hypothesis, later, designated, the, coscinodiscophyceae, mediophyceae, bacillariophyceae, or, coscinodiscophyceae, mediophyceae, bacillariophyceae, cmb, hypothesis, has, been, accepted, by, d, g, mann, among, others, who, uses, it, as, the, basis, for, the, classification, of, diatoms, as, presented, in, adl, et, al, s, series, of, syntheses, 2005, 2012, 2019, and, also, in, the, bacillariophyta, chapter, of, the, 2017, handbook, of, the, protists, edited, by, archibald, et, al, with, some, modifications, reflecting, the, apparent, non, monophyly, of, medlin, et, al, original, coscinodiscophyceae, meanwhile, a, group, led, by, e, c, theriot, favours, a, different, hypothesis, of, phylogeny, which, has, been, termed, the, structural, gradation, hypothesis, sgh, and, does, not, recognise, the, mediophyceae, as, a, monophyletic, group, while, another, analysis, that, of, parks, et, al, 2018, finds, that, the, radial, centric, diatoms, medlin, et, al, s, coscinodiscophyceae, are, not, monophyletic, but, supports, the, monophyly, of, mediophyceae, minus, attheya, which, is, an, anomalous, genus, discussion, of, the, relative, merits, of, these, conflicting, schemes, continues, by, the, various, parties, involved, in, 2019, adl, et, al, presented, the, following, classification, of, diatoms, while, noting, this, revision, reflects, numerous, advances, in, the, phylogeny, of, the, diatoms, over, the, last, decade, due, to, our, poor, taxon, sampling, outside, of, the, mediophyceae, and, pennate, diatoms, and, the, known, and, anticipated, diversity, of, all, diatoms, many, clades, appear, at, a, high, classification, level, and, the, higher, level, classification, is, rather, flat, this, classification, treats, diatoms, as, a, phylum, diatomeae, bacillariophyta, accepts, the, class, mediophyceae, of, medlin, and, co, workers, introduces, new, subphyla, and, classes, for, a, number, of, otherwise, isolated, genera, and, re, ranks, a, number, of, previously, established, taxa, as, subclasses, but, does, not, list, orders, or, families, inferred, ranks, have, been, added, for, clarity, adl, et, al, do, not, use, ranks, but, the, intended, ones, in, this, portion, of, the, classification, are, apparent, from, the, choice, of, endings, used, within, the, system, of, botanical, nomenclature, employed, see, taxonomy, of, diatoms, for, more, details, three, diatom, species, were, sent, to, the, international, space, station, including, the, huge, 6, mm, length, diatoms, of, antarctica, and, the, exclusive, colonial, diatom, bacillaria, paradoxa, the, cells, of, bacillaria, moved, next, to, each, other, in, partial, but, opposite, synchrony, by, a, microfluidics, method, heterokont, chloroplasts, appear, to, derive, from, those, of, red, algae, rather, than, directly, from, prokaryotes, as, occurred, in, plants, this, suggests, they, had, a, more, recent, origin, than, many, other, algae, however, fossil, evidence, is, scant, and, only, with, the, evolution, of, the, diatoms, themselves, do, the, heterokonts, make, a, serious, impression, on, the, fossil, record, the, earliest, known, fossil, diatoms, date, from, the, early, jurassic, 185, ma, ago, although, the, molecular, clock, and, sedimentary, evidence, suggests, an, earlier, origin, it, has, been, suggested, that, their, origin, may, be, related, to, the, end, permian, mass, extinction, 250, ma, after, which, many, marine, niches, were, opened, the, gap, between, this, event, and, the, time, that, fossil, diatoms, first, appear, may, indicate, a, period, when, diatoms, were, unsilicified, and, their, evolution, was, cryptic, since, the, advent, of, silicification, diatoms, have, made, a, significant, impression, on, the, fossil, record, with, major, fossil, deposits, found, as, far, back, as, the, early, cretaceous, and, with, some, rocks, such, as, diatomaceous, earth, being, composed, almost, entirely, of, them, the, expansion, of, grassland, biomes, and, the, evolutionary, radiation, of, grasses, during, the, miocene, is, believed, to, have, increased, the, flux, of, soluble, silicon, to, the, oceans, and, it, has, been, argued, that, this, promoted, the, diatoms, during, the, cenozoic, era, recent, work, suggests, that, diatom, success, is, decoupled, from, the, evolution, of, grasses, although, both, diatom, and, grassland, diversity, increased, strongly, from, the, middle, miocene, diatom, diversity, over, the, cenozoic, has, been, very, sensitive, to, global, temperature, particularly, to, the, equator, pole, temperature, gradient, warmer, oceans, particularly, warmer, polar, regions, have, in, the, past, been, shown, to, have, had, substantially, lower, diatom, diversity, future, warm, oceans, with, enhanced, polar, warming, as, projected, in, global, warming, scenarios, could, thus, in, theory, result, in, a, significant, loss, of, diatom, diversity, although, from, current, knowledge, it, is, impossible, to, say, if, this, would, occur, rapidly, or, only, over, many, tens, of, thousands, of, years, the, fossil, record, of, diatoms, has, largely, been, established, through, the, recovery, of, their, siliceous, frustules, in, marine, and, non, marine, sediments, although, diatoms, have, both, a, marine, and, non, marine, stratigraphic, record, diatom, biostratigraphy, which, is, based, on, time, constrained, evolutionary, originations, and, extinctions, of, unique, taxa, is, only, well, developed, and, widely, applicable, in, marine, systems, the, duration, of, diatom, species, ranges, have, been, documented, through, the, study, of, ocean, cores, and, rock, sequences, exposed, on, land, where, diatom, biozones, are, well, established, and, calibrated, to, the, geomagnetic, polarity, time, scale, e, g, southern, ocean, north, pacific, eastern, equatorial, pacific, diatom, based, age, estimates, may, be, resolved, to, within, 100, 000, years, although, typical, age, resolution, for, cenozoic, diatom, assemblages, is, several, hundred, thousand, years, diatoms, preserved, in, lake, sediments, are, widely, used, for, paleoenvironmental, reconstructions, of, quaternary, climate, especially, for, closed, basin, lakes, which, experience, fluctuations, in, water, depth, and, salinity, when, diatoms, die, their, shells, frustules, can, settle, on, the, seafloor, and, become, microfossils, over, time, these, microfossils, become, buried, as, opal, deposits, in, the, marine, sediment, paleoclimatology, is, the, study, of, past, climates, proxy, data, is, used, in, order, to, relate, elements, collected, in, modern, day, sedimentary, samples, to, climatic, and, oceanic, conditions, in, the, past, paleoclimate, proxies, refer, to, preserved, or, fossilized, physical, markers, which, serve, as, substitutes, for, direct, meteorological, or, ocean, measurements, an, example, of, proxies, is, the, use, of, diatom, isotope, records, of, 13c, 18o, 30si, 13c, diatom, 18o, diatom, and, 30si, diatom, in, 2015, swann, and, snelling, used, these, isotope, records, to, document, historic, changes, in, the, photic, zone, conditions, of, the, north, west, pacific, ocean, including, nutrient, supply, and, the, efficiency, of, the, soft, tissue, biological, pump, from, the, modern, day, back, to, marine, isotope, stage, 5e, which, coincides, with, the, last, interglacial, period, peaks, in, opal, productivity, in, the, marine, isotope, stage, are, associated, with, the, breakdown, of, the, regional, halocline, stratification, and, increased, nutrient, supply, to, the, photic, zone, the, initial, development, of, the, halocline, and, stratified, water, column, has, been, attributed, to, the, onset, of, major, northern, hemisphere, glaciation, at, 2, 73, ma, which, increased, the, flux, of, freshwater, to, the, region, via, increased, monsoonal, rainfall, and, or, glacial, meltwater, and, sea, surface, temperatures, the, decrease, of, abyssal, water, upwelling, associated, with, this, may, have, contributed, to, the, establishment, of, globally, cooler, conditions, and, the, expansion, of, glaciers, across, the, northern, hemisphere, from, 2, 73, ma, while, the, halocline, appears, to, have, prevailed, through, the, late, pliocene, and, early, quaternary, glacial, interglacial, cycles, other, studies, have, shown, that, the, stratification, boundary, may, have, broken, down, in, the, late, quaternary, at, glacial, terminations, and, during, the, early, part, of, interglacials, the, cretaceous, record, of, diatoms, is, limited, but, recent, studies, reveal, a, progressive, diversification, of, diatom, types, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, which, in, the, oceans, dramatically, affected, organisms, with, calcareous, skeletons, appears, to, have, had, relatively, little, impact, on, diatom, evolution, although, no, mass, extinctions, of, marine, diatoms, have, been, observed, during, the, cenozoic, times, of, relatively, rapid, evolutionary, turnover, in, marine, diatom, species, assemblages, occurred, near, the, paleocene, eocene, boundary, and, at, the, eocene, oligocene, boundary, further, turnover, of, assemblages, took, place, at, various, times, between, the, middle, miocene, and, late, pliocene, in, response, to, progressive, cooling, of, polar, regions, and, the, development, of, more, endemic, diatom, assemblages, a, global, trend, toward, more, delicate, diatom, frustules, has, been, noted, from, the, oligocene, to, the, quaternary, this, coincides, with, an, increasingly, more, vigorous, circulation, of, the, ocean, s, surface, and, deep, waters, brought, about, by, increasing, latitudinal, thermal, gradients, at, the, onset, of, major, ice, sheet, expansion, on, antarctica, and, progressive, cooling, through, the, neogene, and, quaternary, towards, a, bipolar, glaciated, world, this, caused, diatoms, to, take, in, less, silica, for, the, formation, of, their, frustules, increased, mixing, of, the, oceans, renews, silica, and, other, nutrients, necessary, for, diatom, growth, in, surface, waters, especially, in, regions, of, coastal, and, oceanic, upwelling, in, 2002, the, first, insights, into, the, properties, of, the, phaeodactylum, tricornutum, gene, repertoire, were, described, using, 1, 000, expressed, sequence, tags, ests, subsequently, the, number, of, ests, was, extended, to, 12, 000, and, the, diatom, est, database, was, constructed, for, functional, analyses, these, sequences, have, been, used, to, make, a, comparative, analysis, between, p, tricornutum, and, the, putative, complete, proteomes, from, the, green, alga, chlamydomonas, reinhardtii, the, red, alga, cyanidioschyzon, merolae, and, the, diatom, thalassiosira, pseudonana, the, diatom, est, database, now, consists, of, over, 200, 000, ests, from, p, tricornutum, 16, libraries, and, t, pseudonana, 7, libraries, cells, grown, in, a, range, of, different, conditions, many, of, which, correspond, to, different, abiotic, stresses, in, 2004, the, entire, genome, of, the, centric, diatom, thalassiosira, pseudonana, 32, 4, mb, was, sequenced, followed, in, 2008, with, the, sequencing, of, the, pennate, diatom, phaeodactylum, tricornutum, 27, 4, mb, comparisons, of, the, two, reveal, that, the, p, tricornutum, genome, includes, fewer, genes, 10, 402, opposed, to, 11, 776, than, t, pseudonana, no, major, synteny, gene, order, could, be, detected, between, the, two, genomes, t, pseudonana, genes, show, an, average, of, 1, 52, introns, per, gene, as, opposed, to, 0, 79, in, p, tricornutum, suggesting, recent, widespread, intron, gain, in, the, centric, diatom, despite, relatively, recent, evolutionary, divergence, 90, million, years, the, extent, of, molecular, divergence, between, centrics, and, pennates, indicates, rapid, evolutionary, rates, within, the, bacillariophyceae, compared, to, other, eukaryotic, groups, comparative, genomics, also, established, that, a, specific, class, of, transposable, elements, the, diatom, copia, like, retrotransposons, or, codis, has, been, significantly, amplified, in, the, p, tricornutum, genome, with, respect, to, t, pseudonana, constituting, 5, 8, and, 1, of, the, respective, genomes, diatom, genomics, brought, much, information, about, the, extent, and, dynamics, of, the, endosymbiotic, gene, transfer, egt, process, comparison, of, the, t, pseudonana, proteins, with, homologs, in, other, organisms, suggested, that, hundreds, have, their, closest, homologs, in, the, plantae, lineage, egt, towards, diatom, genomes, can, be, illustrated, by, the, fact, that, the, t, pseudonana, genome, encodes, six, proteins, which, are, most, closely, related, to, genes, encoded, by, the, guillardia, theta, cryptomonad, nucleomorph, genome, four, of, these, genes, are, also, found, in, red, algal, plastid, genomes, thus, demonstrating, successive, egt, from, red, algal, plastid, to, red, algal, nucleus, nucleomorph, to, heterokont, host, nucleus, more, recent, phylogenomic, analyses, of, diatom, proteomes, provided, evidence, for, a, prasinophyte, like, endosymbiont, in, the, common, ancestor, of, chromalveolates, as, supported, by, the, fact, the, 70, of, diatom, genes, of, plantae, origin, are, of, green, lineage, provenance, and, that, such, genes, are, also, found, in, the, genome, of, other, stramenopiles, therefore, it, was, proposed, that, chromalveolates, are, the, product, of, serial, secondary, endosymbiosis, first, with, a, green, algae, followed, by, a, second, one, with, a, red, algae, that, conserved, the, genomic, footprints, of, the, previous, but, displaced, the, green, plastid, however, phylogenomic, analyses, of, diatom, proteomes, and, chromalveolate, evolutionary, history, will, likely, take, advantage, of, complementary, genomic, data, from, under, sequenced, lineages, such, as, red, algae, in, addition, to, egt, horizontal, gene, transfer, hgt, can, occur, independently, of, an, endosymbiotic, event, the, publication, of, the, p, tricornutum, genome, reported, that, at, least, 587, p, tricornutum, genes, appear, to, be, most, closely, related, to, bacterial, genes, accounting, for, more, than, 5, of, the, p, tricornutum, proteome, about, half, of, these, are, also, found, in, the, t, pseudonana, genome, attesting, their, ancient, incorporation, in, the, diatom, lineage, to, understand, the, biological, mechanisms, which, underlie, the, great, importance, of, diatoms, in, geochemical, cycles, scientists, have, used, the, phaeodactylum, tricornutum, and, thalassiosira, spp, species, as, model, organisms, since, the, 90, s, few, molecular, biology, tools, are, currently, available, to, generate, mutants, or, transgenic, lines, plasmids, containing, transgenes, are, inserted, into, the, cells, using, the, biolistic, method, or, transkingdom, bacterial, conjugation, with, 10, 6, and, 10, 4, yield, respectively, and, other, classical, transfection, methods, such, as, electroporation, or, use, of, peg, have, been, reported, to, provide, results, with, lower, efficiencies, transfected, plasmids, can, be, either, randomly, integrated, into, the, diatom, s, chromosomes, or, maintained, as, stable, circular, episomes, thanks, to, the, cen6, arsh4, his3, yeast, centromeric, sequence, the, phleomycin, zeocin, resistance, gene, sh, ble, is, commonly, used, as, a, selection, marker, and, various, transgenes, have, been, successfully, introduced, and, expressed, in, diatoms, with, stable, transmissions, through, generations, or, with, the, possibility, to, remove, it, furthermore, these, systems, now, allow, the, use, of, the, crispr, cas, genome, edition, tool, leading, to, a, fast, production, of, functional, knock, out, mutants, and, a, more, accurate, comprehension, of, the, diatoms, cellular, processes, decomposition, and, decay, of, diatoms, leads, to, organic, and, inorganic, in, the, form, of, silicates, sediment, the, inorganic, component, of, which, can, lead, to, a, method, of, analyzing, past, marine, environments, by, corings, of, ocean, floors, or, bay, muds, since, the, inorganic, matter, is, embedded, in, deposition, of, clays, and, silts, and, forms, a, permanent, geological, record, of, such, marine, strata, see, siliceous, ooze, diatoms, and, their, shells, frustules, as, diatomite, or, diatomaceous, earth, are, important, industrial, resources, used, for, fine, polishing, and, liquid, filtration, the, complex, structure, of, their, microscopic, shells, has, been, proposed, as, a, material, for, nanotechnology, diatomite, is, considered, to, be, a, natural, nano, material, and, has, many, uses, and, applications, such, as, production, of, various, ceramic, products, construction, ceramics, refractory, ceramics, special, oxide, ceramics, for, production, of, humidity, control, materials, used, as, filtration, material, material, in, the, cement, production, industry, initial, material, for, production, of, prolonged, release, drug, carriers, absorption, material, in, an, industrial, scale, production, of, porous, ceramics, glass, industry, used, as, catalyst, support, as, a, filler, in, plastics, and, paints, purification, of, industrial, waters, pesticide, holder, as, well, as, for, improving, the, physical, and, chemical, characteristics, of, certain, soils, and, other, uses, diatoms, are, also, used, to, help, determine, the, origin, of, materials, containing, them, including, seawater, the, deposition, of, silica, by, diatoms, may, also, prove, to, be, of, utility, to, nanotechnology, diatom, cells, repeatedly, and, reliably, manufacture, valves, of, various, shapes, and, sizes, potentially, allowing, diatoms, to, manufacture, micro, or, nano, scale, structures, which, may, be, of, use, in, a, range, of, devices, including, optical, systems, semiconductor, nanolithography, and, even, vehicles, for, drug, delivery, with, an, appropriate, artificial, selection, procedure, diatoms, that, produce, valves, of, particular, shapes, and, sizes, might, be, evolved, for, cultivation, in, chemostat, cultures, to, mass, produce, nanoscale, components, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, diatoms, could, be, used, as, a, component, of, solar, cells, by, substituting, photosensitive, titanium, dioxide, for, the, silicon, dioxide, that, diatoms, normally, use, to, create, their, cell, walls, diatom, biofuel, producing, solar, panels, have, also, been, proposed, the, main, goal, of, diatom, analysis, in, forensics, is, to, differentiate, a, death, by, submersion, from, a, post, mortem, immersion, of, a, body, in, water, laboratory, tests, may, reveal, the, presence, of, diatoms, in, the, body, since, the, silica, based, skeletons, of, diatoms, do, not, readily, decay, they, can, sometimes, be, detected, even, in, heavily, decomposed, bodies, as, they, do, not, occur, naturally, in, the, body, if, laboratory, tests, show, diatoms, in, the, corpse, that, are, of, the, same, species, found, in, the, water, where, the, body, was, recovered, then, it, may, be, good, evidence, of, drowning, as, the, cause, of, death, the, blend, of, diatom, species, found, in, a, corpse, may, be, the, same, or, different, from, the, surrounding, water, indicating, whether, the, victim, drowned, in, the, same, site, in, which, the, body, was, found, the, first, illustrations, of, diatoms, are, found, in, an, article, from, 1703, in, transactions, of, the, royal, society, showing, unmistakable, drawings, of, tabellaria, although, the, publication, was, authored, by, an, unnamed, english, gentleman, there, is, recent, evidence, that, he, was, charles, king, of, staffordshire, it, is, only, 80, years, later, that, we, find, the, first, formally, identified, diatom, the, colonial, bacillaria, paxillifera, discovered, and, described, in, 1783, by, danish, naturalist, otto, friedrich, m, ller, like, many, others, after, him, he, wrongly, thought, that, it, was, an, animal, due, to, its, ability, to, move, even, charles, darwin, saw, diatom, remains, in, dust, whilst, in, the, cape, verde, islands, although, he, was, not, sure, what, they, were, it, was, only, later, that, they, were, identified, for, him, as, siliceous, polygastrics, the, infusoria, that, darwin, later, noted, in, the, face, paint, of, fueguinos, native, inhabitants, of, tierra, del, fuego, in, the, southern, end, of, south, america, were, later, identified, in, the, same, way, during, his, lifetime, the, siliceous, polygastrics, were, clarified, as, belonging, to, the, diatomaceae, and, darwin, struggled, to, understand, the, reasons, underpinning, their, beauty, he, exchanged, opinions, with, the, noted, cryptogamist, g, h, k, thwaites, on, the, topic, in, the, fourth, edition, of, on, the, origin, of, species, he, stated, that, few, objects, are, more, beautiful, than, the, minute, siliceous, cases, of, the, diatomaceae, were, these, created, that, they, might, be, examined, and, admired, under, the, high, powers, of, the, microscope, and, reasoned, that, their, exquisite, morphologies, must, have, functional, underpinnings, rather, than, having, been, created, purely, for, humans, to, admire
