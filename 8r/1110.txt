lettuce, lactuca, sativa, is, an, annual, plant, of, the, family, asteraceae, it, is, most, often, grown, as, a, leaf, vegetable, but, sometimes, for, its, stem, and, seeds, lettuce, is, most, often, used, for, salads, although, it, is, also, seen, in, other, kinds, of, food, such, as, soups, sandwiches, and, wraps, it, can, also, be, grilled, one, variety, celtuce, asparagus, lettuce, is, grown, for, its, stems, which, are, eaten, either, raw, or, cooked, in, addition, to, its, main, use, as, a, leafy, green, it, has, also, gathered, religious, and, medicinal, significance, over, centuries, of, human, consumption, europe, and, north, america, originally, dominated, the, market, for, lettuce, but, by, the, late, 20th, century, the, consumption, of, lettuce, had, spread, throughout, the, world, as, of, 2021, world, production, of, lettuce, and, chicory, was, 27, million, tonnes, 53, percent, of, which, came, from, china, lettuce, was, originally, farmed, by, the, ancient, egyptians, who, transformed, it, from, a, plant, whose, seeds, were, used, to, obtain, oil, into, an, important, food, crop, raised, for, its, succulent, leaves, and, oil, rich, seeds, lettuce, spread, to, the, greeks, and, romans, the, latter, gave, it, the, name, lactuca, from, which, the, english, lettuce, is, derived, by, 50, ad, many, types, were, described, and, lettuce, appeared, often, in, medieval, writings, including, several, herbals, the, 16th, through, 18th, centuries, saw, the, development, of, many, varieties, in, europe, and, by, the, mid, 18th, century, cultivars, were, described, that, can, still, be, found, in, modern, gardens, generally, grown, as, a, hardy, annual, lettuce, is, easily, cultivated, although, it, requires, relatively, low, temperatures, to, prevent, it, from, flowering, quickly, it, can, be, plagued, by, numerous, nutrient, deficiencies, as, well, as, insect, and, mammal, pests, and, fungal, and, bacterial, diseases, l, sativa, crosses, easily, within, the, species, and, with, some, other, species, within, the, genus, lactuca, although, this, trait, can, be, a, problem, to, home, gardeners, who, attempt, to, save, seeds, biologists, have, used, it, to, broaden, the, gene, pool, of, cultivated, lettuce, varieties, lettuce, is, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, k, and, vitamin, a, and, a, moderate, source, of, folate, and, iron, contaminated, lettuce, is, often, a, source, of, bacterial, viral, and, parasitic, outbreaks, in, humans, including, e, coli, and, salmonella, lactuca, sativa, is, a, member, of, the, lactuca, lettuce, genus, and, the, asteraceae, sunflower, or, aster, family, the, species, was, first, described, in, 1753, by, carl, linnaeus, in, the, second, volume, of, his, species, plantarum, synonyms, for, l, sativa, include, lactuca, scariola, var, sativa, l, scariola, var, integrata, and, l, scariola, var, integrifolia, l, scariola, is, itself, a, synonym, for, l, serriola, the, common, wild, or, prickly, lettuce, l, sativa, also, has, many, identified, taxonomic, groups, subspecies, and, varieties, which, delineate, the, various, cultivar, groups, of, domesticated, lettuce, lettuce, is, closely, related, to, several, lactuca, species, from, southwest, asia, the, closest, relationship, is, to, l, serriola, an, aggressive, weed, common, in, temperate, and, subtropical, zones, in, much, of, the, world, the, romans, referred, to, lettuce, as, lactuca, lac, meaning, dairy, in, latin, an, allusion, to, the, white, substance, latex, exuded, by, cut, stems, the, name, lactuca, has, become, the, genus, name, while, sativa, meaning, sown, or, cultivated, was, added, to, create, the, species, name, the, current, word, lettuce, originally, from, middle, english, came, from, the, old, french, letues, or, laitues, which, derived, from, the, roman, name, the, name, romaine, came, from, the, variety, of, lettuce, grown, in, the, roman, papal, gardens, while, cos, another, term, for, romaine, lettuce, came, from, the, earliest, european, seeds, of, the, type, from, the, greek, island, of, kos, a, center, of, lettuce, farming, in, the, byzantine, period, lettuce, s, native, range, spreads, from, the, mediterranean, to, siberia, although, it, has, been, transported, to, almost, all, areas, of, the, world, plants, generally, have, a, height, and, spread, of, 15, to, 30, cm, 6, to, 12, in, the, leaves, are, colorful, mainly, in, the, green, and, red, color, spectrums, with, some, variegated, varieties, there, are, also, a, few, varieties, with, yellow, gold, or, blue, teal, leaves, lettuces, have, a, wide, range, of, shapes, and, textures, from, the, dense, heads, of, the, iceberg, type, to, the, notched, scalloped, frilly, or, ruffly, leaves, of, leaf, varieties, lettuce, plants, have, a, root, system, that, includes, a, main, taproot, and, smaller, secondary, roots, some, varieties, especially, those, found, in, the, united, states, and, western, europe, have, long, narrow, taproots, and, a, small, set, of, secondary, roots, longer, taproots, and, more, extensive, secondary, systems, are, found, in, varieties, from, asia, depending, on, the, variety, and, time, of, year, lettuce, generally, lives, 65, 130, days, from, planting, to, harvesting, because, lettuce, that, flowers, through, the, process, known, as, bolting, becomes, bitter, and, unsaleable, plants, grown, for, consumption, are, rarely, allowed, to, grow, to, maturity, lettuce, flowers, more, quickly, in, hot, temperatures, while, freezing, temperatures, cause, slower, growth, and, sometimes, damage, to, outer, leaves, once, plants, move, past, the, edible, stage, they, develop, flower, stalks, up, to, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, high, with, small, yellow, blossoms, like, other, members, of, the, tribe, cichorieae, lettuce, inflorescences, also, known, as, flower, heads, or, capitula, are, composed, of, multiple, florets, each, with, a, modified, calyx, called, a, pappus, which, becomes, the, feathery, parachute, of, the, fruit, a, corolla, of, five, petals, fused, into, a, ligule, or, strap, and, the, reproductive, parts, these, include, fused, anthers, that, form, a, tube, which, surrounds, a, style, and, bipartite, stigma, as, the, anthers, shed, pollen, the, style, elongates, to, allow, the, stigmas, now, coated, with, pollen, to, emerge, from, the, tube, the, ovaries, form, compressed, obovate, teardrop, shaped, dry, fruits, that, do, not, open, at, maturity, measuring, 3, to, 4, mm, long, the, fruits, have, 5, 7, ribs, on, each, side, and, are, tipped, by, two, rows, of, small, white, hairs, the, pappus, remains, at, the, top, of, each, fruit, as, a, dispersal, structure, each, fruit, contains, one, seed, which, can, be, white, yellow, gray, or, brown, depending, on, the, variety, of, lettuce, the, domestication, of, lettuce, over, the, centuries, has, resulted, in, several, changes, through, selective, breeding, delayed, bolting, larger, seeds, larger, leaves, and, heads, better, taste, and, texture, a, lower, latex, content, and, different, leaf, shapes, and, colors, work, in, these, areas, continues, through, the, present, day, scientific, research, into, the, genetic, modification, of, lettuce, is, ongoing, with, over, 85, field, trials, taking, place, between, 1992, and, 2005, in, the, european, union, and, the, united, states, to, test, modifications, allowing, greater, herbicide, tolerance, greater, resistance, to, insects, and, fungi, and, slower, bolting, patterns, however, genetically, modified, lettuce, is, not, currently, used, in, commercial, agriculture, lettuce, was, first, cultivated, in, ancient, egypt, for, the, production, of, oil, from, its, seeds, the, plant, was, probably, selectively, bred, by, the, egyptians, into, a, plant, grown, for, its, edible, leaves, with, evidence, of, its, cultivation, appearing, as, early, as, 2680, bc, lettuce, was, considered, a, sacred, plant, of, the, reproduction, god, min, and, was, carried, during, his, festivals, and, placed, near, his, images, the, plant, was, thought, to, help, the, god, perform, the, sexual, act, untiringly, its, use, in, religious, ceremonies, resulted, in, the, creation, of, many, images, in, tombs, and, wall, paintings, the, cultivated, variety, appears, to, have, been, about, 75, cm, 30, in, tall, and, resembled, a, large, version, of, the, modern, romaine, lettuce, these, upright, lettuces, were, developed, by, the, egyptians, and, passed, to, the, greeks, who, in, turn, shared, them, with, the, romans, around, 50, ad, roman, agriculturalist, columella, described, several, lettuce, varieties, some, of, which, may, have, been, ancestors, of, today, s, lettuces, lettuce, appears, in, many, medieval, writings, especially, as, a, medicinal, herb, hildegard, of, bingen, mentioned, it, in, her, writings, on, medicinal, herbs, between, 1098, and, 1179, and, many, early, herbals, also, describe, its, uses, in, 1586, joachim, camerarius, provided, descriptions, of, the, three, basic, modern, lettuces, head, lettuce, loose, leaf, lettuce, and, romaine, or, cos, lettuce, lettuce, was, first, brought, to, the, americas, from, europe, by, christopher, columbus, in, the, late, 15th, century, between, the, late, 16th, century, and, the, early, 18th, century, many, varieties, were, developed, in, europe, particularly, holland, books, published, in, the, mid, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, describe, several, varieties, found, in, gardens, today, due, to, its, short, lifespan, after, harvest, lettuce, was, originally, sold, relatively, close, to, where, it, was, grown, the, early, 20th, century, saw, the, development, of, new, packing, storage, and, shipping, technologies, that, improved, the, lifespan, and, transportability, of, lettuce, and, resulted, in, a, significant, increase, in, availability, during, the, 1950s, lettuce, production, was, revolutionized, with, the, development, of, vacuum, cooling, which, allowed, field, cooling, and, packing, of, lettuce, replacing, the, previously, used, method, of, ice, cooling, in, packing, houses, outside, the, fields, lettuce, is, easy, to, grow, and, as, such, has, been, a, significant, source, of, sales, for, many, seed, companies, tracing, the, history, of, many, varieties, is, complicated, by, the, practice, of, many, companies, particularly, in, the, us, of, changing, a, variety, s, name, from, year, to, year, this, practice, is, conducted, for, several, reasons, the, most, prominent, being, to, boost, sales, by, promoting, a, new, variety, or, to, prevent, customers, from, knowing, that, the, variety, had, been, developed, by, a, competing, seed, company, documentation, from, the, late, 19th, century, shows, between, 65, and, 140, distinct, varieties, of, lettuce, depending, on, the, amount, of, variation, allowed, between, types, a, distinct, difference, from, the, 1, 100, named, lettuce, varieties, on, the, market, at, the, time, names, also, often, changed, significantly, from, country, to, country, although, most, lettuce, grown, today, is, used, as, a, vegetable, a, minor, amount, is, used, in, the, production, of, tobacco, free, cigarettes, however, domestic, lettuce, s, wild, relatives, produce, a, leaf, that, visually, more, closely, resembles, tobacco, a, hardy, annual, some, varieties, of, lettuce, can, be, overwintered, even, in, relatively, cold, climates, under, a, layer, of, straw, and, older, heirloom, varieties, are, often, grown, in, cold, frames, lettuces, meant, for, the, cutting, of, individual, leaves, are, generally, planted, straight, into, the, garden, in, thick, rows, heading, varieties, of, lettuces, are, commonly, started, in, flats, then, transplanted, to, individual, spots, usually, 20, to, 36, cm, 7, 9, to, 14, 2, in, apart, in, the, garden, after, developing, several, leaves, lettuce, spaced, farther, apart, receives, more, sunlight, which, improves, color, and, nutrient, quantities, in, the, leaves, pale, to, white, lettuce, such, as, the, centers, in, some, iceberg, lettuce, contain, few, nutrients, lettuce, grows, best, in, full, sun, in, loose, nitrogen, rich, soils, with, a, ph, of, between, 6, 0, and, 6, 8, heat, generally, prompts, lettuce, to, bolt, with, most, varieties, growing, poorly, above, 24, c, 75, f, cool, temperatures, prompt, better, performance, with, 16, to, 18, c, 61, to, 64, f, being, preferred, and, as, low, as, 7, c, 45, f, being, tolerated, plants, in, hot, areas, that, are, provided, partial, shade, during, the, hottest, part, of, the, day, will, bolt, more, slowly, temperatures, above, 27, c, 81, f, will, generally, result, in, poor, or, non, existent, germination, of, lettuce, seeds, after, harvest, lettuce, lasts, the, longest, when, kept, at, 0, c, 32, f, and, 96, percent, humidity, the, high, water, content, of, lettuce, 94, 9, percent, creates, problems, when, attempting, to, preserve, the, plant, it, cannot, be, successfully, frozen, canned, or, dried, and, must, be, eaten, fresh, in, spite, of, its, high, water, content, traditionally, grown, lettuce, has, a, low, water, footprint, with, 237, liters, 52, imp, gal, 63, u, s, gal, of, water, required, for, each, kilogram, of, lettuce, produced, hydroponic, growing, methods, can, reduce, this, water, consumption, by, nearly, two, orders, of, magnitude, lettuce, varieties, will, cross, with, each, other, making, spacing, of, 1, 5, to, 6, m, 60, to, 240, in, between, varieties, necessary, to, prevent, contamination, when, saving, seeds, lettuce, will, also, cross, with, lactuca, serriola, wild, lettuce, with, the, resulting, seeds, often, producing, a, plant, with, tough, bitter, leaves, celtuce, a, lettuce, variety, grown, primarily, in, asia, for, its, stems, crosses, easily, with, lettuces, grown, for, their, leaves, this, propensity, for, crossing, however, has, led, to, breeding, programs, using, closely, related, species, in, lactuca, such, as, l, serriola, l, saligna, and, l, virosa, to, broaden, the, available, gene, pool, starting, in, the, 1990s, such, programs, began, to, include, more, distantly, related, species, such, as, l, tatarica, seeds, keep, best, when, stored, in, cool, conditions, and, unless, stored, cryogenically, remain, viable, the, longest, when, stored, at, 20, c, 4, f, they, are, relatively, short, lived, in, storage, at, room, temperature, lettuce, seeds, remain, viable, for, only, a, few, months, however, when, newly, harvested, lettuce, seed, is, stored, cryogenically, this, life, increases, to, a, half, life, of, 500, years, for, vaporized, nitrogen, and, 3, 400, years, for, liquid, nitrogen, this, advantage, is, lost, if, seeds, are, not, frozen, promptly, after, harvesting, there, are, several, types, or, cultivars, of, lettuce, three, types, leaf, head, and, cos, or, romaine, are, the, most, common, there, are, seven, main, cultivar, groups, of, lettuce, each, including, many, varieties, the, butterhead, and, crisphead, types, are, sometimes, known, together, as, cabbage, lettuce, because, their, heads, are, shorter, flatter, and, more, cabbage, like, than, romaine, lettuces, soil, nutrient, deficiencies, can, cause, a, variety, of, plant, problems, that, range, from, malformed, plants, to, a, lack, of, head, growth, many, insects, are, attracted, to, lettuce, including, cutworms, which, cut, seedlings, off, at, the, soil, line, wireworms, and, nematodes, which, cause, yellow, stunted, plants, tarnished, plant, bugs, and, aphids, which, cause, yellow, distorted, leaves, leafhoppers, which, cause, stunted, growth, and, pale, leaves, thrips, which, turn, leaves, gray, green, or, silver, leafminers, which, create, tunnels, within, the, leaves, flea, beetles, which, cut, small, holes, in, leaves, and, caterpillars, slugs, and, snails, which, cut, large, holes, in, leaves, for, example, the, larvae, of, the, ghost, moth, is, a, common, pest, of, lettuce, plants, mammals, including, rabbits, and, groundhogs, also, eat, the, plants, lettuce, contains, several, defensive, compounds, including, sesquiterpene, lactones, and, other, natural, phenolics, such, as, flavonol, and, glycosides, which, help, to, protect, it, against, pests, certain, varieties, contain, more, than, others, and, some, selective, breeding, and, genetic, modification, studies, have, focused, on, using, this, trait, to, identify, and, produce, commercial, varieties, with, increased, pest, resistance, lettuce, also, suffers, from, several, viral, diseases, including, big, vein, which, causes, yellow, distorted, leaves, and, mosaic, virus, which, is, spread, by, aphids, and, causes, stunted, plant, growth, and, deformed, leaves, aster, yellows, are, a, disease, causing, bacteria, carried, by, leafhoppers, which, causes, deformed, leaves, fungal, diseases, include, powdery, mildew, and, downy, mildew, which, cause, leaves, to, mold, and, die, and, bottom, rot, lettuce, drop, and, gray, mold, which, cause, entire, plants, to, rot, and, collapse, bacterial, diseases, include, botrytis, cinerea, for, which, uv, c, treatments, may, be, used, v, squez, et, al, 2017, find, that, phenylalanine, ammonia, lyase, activity, phenolic, production, and, b, cinerea, resistance, are, increased, by, uv, c, crowding, lettuce, tends, to, attract, pests, and, diseases, weeds, can, also, be, an, issue, as, cultivated, lettuce, is, generally, not, competitive, with, them, especially, when, directly, seeded, into, the, ground, transplanted, lettuce, started, in, flats, and, later, moved, to, growing, beds, is, generally, more, competitive, initially, but, can, still, be, crowded, later, in, the, season, causing, misshapen, lettuce, and, lower, yields, weeds, also, act, as, homes, for, insects, and, disease, and, can, make, harvesting, more, difficult, herbicides, are, often, used, to, control, weeds, in, commercial, production, however, this, has, led, to, the, development, of, herbicide, resistant, weeds, in, lettuce, cultivation, in, 2022, world, production, of, lettuce, report, combined, with, chicory, was, 27, million, tonnes, with, china, alone, producing, 55, of, the, total, table, lettuce, is, the, only, member, of, the, genus, lactuca, to, be, grown, commercially, although, china, is, the, top, world, producer, of, lettuce, the, majority, of, the, crop, is, consumed, domestically, western, europe, and, north, america, were, the, original, major, markets, for, large, scale, lettuce, production, by, the, late, 1900s, asia, south, america, australia, and, africa, became, more, substantial, markets, different, locations, tended, to, prefer, different, types, of, lettuce, with, butterhead, prevailing, in, northern, europe, and, great, britain, romaine, in, the, mediterranean, and, stem, lettuce, in, china, and, egypt, by, the, late, 20th, century, the, preferred, types, began, to, change, with, crisphead, especially, iceberg, lettuce, becoming, the, dominant, type, in, northern, europe, and, great, britain, and, more, popular, in, western, europe, in, the, us, no, one, type, predominated, until, the, early, 20th, century, when, crisphead, lettuces, began, gaining, popularity, after, the, 1940s, with, the, development, of, iceberg, lettuce, 95, percent, of, the, lettuce, grown, and, consumed, in, the, us, was, crisphead, lettuce, by, the, end, of, the, century, other, types, began, to, regain, popularity, and, eventually, made, up, over, 30, percent, of, production, stem, lettuce, was, first, developed, in, china, where, it, remains, primarily, cultivated, in, the, early, 21st, century, bagged, salad, products, increased, in, the, lettuce, market, especially, in, the, us, where, innovative, packaging, and, shipping, methods, prolonged, freshness, in, the, united, states, in, 2022, lettuce, was, the, main, vegetable, ingredient, in, salads, and, was, the, most, consumed, among, leaf, vegetables, its, market, was, about, 20, of, all, vegetables, with, romaine, and, iceberg, having, about, equal, sales, some, 85, of, the, lettuce, consumed, in, the, united, states, in, 2022, was, produced, domestically, as, described, around, 50, ad, lettuce, leaves, were, often, cooked, and, served, by, the, romans, with, an, oil, and, vinegar, dressing, however, smaller, leaves, were, sometimes, eaten, raw, during, the, 81, 96, ad, reign, of, domitian, the, tradition, of, serving, a, lettuce, salad, before, a, meal, began, post, roman, europe, continued, the, tradition, of, poaching, lettuce, mainly, with, large, romaine, types, as, well, as, the, method, of, pouring, a, hot, oil, and, vinegar, mixture, over, the, leaves, today, the, majority, of, lettuce, is, grown, for, its, leaves, although, one, type, is, grown, for, its, stem, and, one, for, its, seeds, which, are, made, into, an, oil, most, lettuce, is, used, in, salads, either, alone, or, with, other, greens, vegetables, meats, and, cheeses, romaine, lettuce, is, often, used, for, caesar, salads, lettuce, leaves, can, also, be, found, in, soups, sandwiches, and, wraps, while, the, stems, are, eaten, both, raw, and, cooked, the, consumption, of, lettuce, in, china, developed, differently, from, in, western, countries, due, to, health, risks, and, cultural, aversion, to, eating, raw, leaves, chinese, salads, are, composed, of, cooked, vegetables, and, are, served, hot, or, cold, lettuce, is, also, used, in, a, larger, variety, of, dishes, than, in, western, countries, contributing, to, a, range, of, dishes, including, bean, curd, and, meat, dishes, soups, and, stir, frys, plain, or, with, other, vegetables, stem, lettuce, widely, consumed, in, china, is, eaten, either, raw, or, cooked, the, latter, primarily, in, soups, and, stir, frys, lettuce, is, also, used, as, a, primary, ingredient, in, the, preparation, of, lettuce, soup, raw, iceberg, lettuce, is, 96, water, 3, carbohydrates, and, contains, negligible, protein, and, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, iceberg, lettuce, supplies, 14, calories, and, is, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, k, 20, dv, with, no, other, micronutrients, in, significant, content, table, in, lettuce, varieties, with, dark, green, leaves, such, as, romaine, also, called, cos, vitamin, a, contents, are, appreciable, due, to, the, presence, of, the, provitamin, a, compound, beta, carotene, dark, green, varieties, of, lettuce, also, contain, moderate, amounts, of, calcium, and, iron, the, edible, spine, and, ribs, of, the, lettuce, plant, supply, dietary, fiber, while, micronutrients, are, contained, in, the, leaf, portion, food, borne, pathogens, that, can, survive, on, lettuce, include, listeria, monocytogenes, the, causative, agent, of, listeriosis, which, multiplies, in, storage, however, despite, high, levels, of, bacteria, being, found, on, ready, to, eat, lettuce, products, a, 2008, study, found, no, incidents, of, food, borne, illness, related, to, listeriosis, possibly, due, to, the, product, s, short, shelf, life, indigenous, microflora, competing, with, the, listeria, bacteria, or, inhibition, of, bacteria, to, cause, listeriosis, other, bacteria, found, on, lettuce, include, aeromonas, species, which, have, not, been, linked, to, any, outbreaks, campylobacter, species, which, cause, campylobacteriosis, and, yersinia, intermedia, and, yersinia, kristensenii, species, of, yersinia, which, have, been, found, mainly, in, lettuce, salmonella, bacteria, including, the, uncommon, salmonella, braenderup, type, have, also, caused, outbreaks, traced, to, contaminated, lettuce, viruses, including, hepatitis, a, calicivirus, and, a, norwalk, like, strain, have, been, found, in, lettuce, the, vegetable, has, also, been, linked, to, outbreaks, of, parasitic, infestations, including, giardia, lamblia, lettuce, has, been, linked, to, numerous, outbreaks, of, the, bacteria, e, coli, o157, h7, and, shigella, the, plants, were, most, likely, contaminated, through, contact, with, animal, or, human, feces, a, 2007, study, determined, that, the, vacuum, cooling, method, especially, prevalent, in, the, california, lettuce, industry, increased, the, uptake, and, survival, rates, of, e, coli, o157, h7, scientific, experiments, using, treated, municipal, wastewater, as, irrigation, for, romaine, lettuce, have, shown, that, the, contamination, levels, of, foliage, leachate, and, soil, with, e, coli, and, ap205, bacteriophage, used, by, researchers, as, a, surrogate, for, enteric, viruses, respectively, were, directly, correlated, with, the, presence, of, these, organisms, in, the, irrigation, water, due, to, the, increase, in, food, demand, the, use, of, treated, wastewater, effluent, for, irrigation, and, animal, or, human, excreta, i, e, manure, or, biosolids, as, soil, amendments, is, increasing, as, such, so, are, the, outbreaks, of, food, borne, illnesses, due, to, the, overuse, of, antibiotics, in, farming, the, number, of, pathogens, resistant, to, antibiotics, is, increasing, one, of, these, being, ar, e, coli, which, has, been, found, on, lettuce, irrigated, with, wastewater, pathogens, found, on, lettuce, are, not, specific, to, lettuce, though, some, e, coli, strains, have, affinity, for, romaine, but, unlike, other, vegetables, which, tend, to, be, cooked, lettuce, is, eaten, raw, thus, food, borne, outbreaks, associated, with, it, are, more, frequent, and, affect, a, larger, number, of, people
