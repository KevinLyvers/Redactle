term, hunting, dog, is, broad, and, includes, all, breeds, and, skills, of, hunting, canines, but, gun, dogs, refers, to, canines, that, are, trained, to, work, alongside, a, loud, firearm, while,

to, method, of, work, gun, dogs, often, have, skills, extending, beyond, the, tasks, outlined, for, their, classification, depending, upon, how, they, are, trained, dogs, may, be, useful, in, a, variety, of, hunting, situations, the, methods, described, here, are, analogous, to, human, canine, hunting, going, back, tens, of, thousands, of, years, upon, reaching, the, field, the, handler, often, will, cast, or, direct, the, dog, in, a, wide, circle, experienced, dogs, will, search, the, edges, of, the, field, knowing, that, birds, are, usually, found, there, this, wide, run, helps, to, burn, off, the, dog, s, initial, exuberance, and, may, help, the, dog, establish, its, bearings, and, form, a, background, upon, which, game, smells, will, be, processed, the, dog, then, begins, working, back, and, forth, starting, near, the, hunter, and, slowly, ranging, out, the, dog, repeats, this, process, as, the, hunters, move, through, the, field, how, far, a, handler, allows, the, dog, to, range, is, a, matter, of, personal, preference, when, a, pair, of, dogs, work, as, a, team, one, works, close, in, while, the, other, ranges, out, in, larger, circles, if, either, dog, becomes, birdy, the, other, dog, works, its, way, over, to, assist, good, bird, dogs, are, alert, to, their, handlers, and, to, the, disposition, of, other, dogs, in, the, field, they, should, readily, comply, if, the, handler, casts, them, to, an, area, of, particular, interest, such, as, a, brush, pile, when, game, is, detected, a, dog, freezes, either, pointing, or, crouching, if, other, dogs, are, present, they, also, freeze, honoring, the, first, dog, s, point, the, pointing, dog, remains, motionless, until, the, hunters, are, in, position, handlers, give, the, command, whoa, instructing, the, dog, to, remain, still, what, happens, next, depends, on, the, dog, s, training, some, trainers, train, the, dog, to, stay, motionless, while, the, hunter, steps, forward, and, flushes, the, game, other, trainers, direct, the, dog, to, flush, the, game, with, a, command, such, as, get, it, pointing, dogs, excel, on, covey, type, birds, such, as, bobwhite, quail, and, grouse, as, these, birds, will, hold, in, position, well, allowing, the, hunter, to, approach, and, get, into, position, if, a, bird, is, downed, the, dogs, are, instructed, to, search, for, and, retrieve, it, with, the, command, dead, bird, or, simply, dead, when, hunting, upland, game, flushing, dogs, spaniels, and, retrievers, work, much, more, closely, with, the, hunter, flushers, will, not, cover, the, same, amount, of, ground, as, a, pointing, dog, as, the, flusher, must, be, kept, within, shotgun, distance, flushing, dogs, are, often, used, on, birds, that, run, from, the, hunter, on, such, birds, as, pheasant, an, aggressive, flush, is, necessary, to, spring, the, bird, to, wing, flushing, dogs, excel, on, these, types, of, bird, because, they, do, not, point, the, birds, giving, them, little, time, for, escape, on, the, ground, pointing, breeds, are, used, on, such, birds, but, must, be, well, trained, to, know, when, the, bird, pointed, has, moved, once, a, bird, has, been, flushed, the, dog, will, sit, or, hup, to, watch, the, flight, of, the, bird, and, mark, the, fallen, birds, for, retrieval, a, dog, which, does, this, successfully, is, referred, to, as, steady, to, wing, and, shot, steadiness, is, the, hallmark, of, the, finished, spaniel, when, a, bird, is, shot, the, dog, should, mark, where, it, fell, and, wait, until, given, the, command, to, retrieve, once, commanded, the, dog, will, race, to, the, point, of, fall, pick, up, the, bird, and, return, it, to, the, handler, retrievers, are, typically, used, when, waterfowl, hunting, although, they, can, also, be, employed, in, hunting, upland, birds, as, well, since, a, majority, of, waterfowl, hunting, employs, the, use, of, small, boats, in, winter, conditions, retrievers, are, expected, to, remain, sitting, calmly, and, quietly, until, sent, to, retrieve, as, birds, move, into, range, a, well, trained, retriever, will, watch, and, follow, the, handler, s, gun, as, he, shoots, marking, and, remembering, each, bird, that, is, downed, this, is, called, marking, off, the, gun, and, the, downed, birds, are, called, marks, retrievers, often, are, expected, to, recall, the, location, of, many, downed, birds, in, one, sitting, before, they, retrieve, game, once, the, shooting, has, ceased, the, handler, commands, the, dog, to, retrieve, each, bird, that, has, been, downed, if, a, dog, did, not, see, the, bird, fall, a, retriever, takes, direction, from, the, handler, who, can, use, hand, and, whistle, signals, to, guide, the, dog, to, the, unseen, downed, bird, this, is, called, a, blind, retrieve, during, a, typical, day, of, shooting, additional, birds, are, frequently, downed, while, the, dog, is, performing, a, retrieve, retrievers, are, taught, to, ignore, these, diversions, until, the, current, retrieve, has, been, completed, also, at, times, multiple, dogs, are, used, on, a, hunt, and, retrievers, are, also, taught, to, honor, another, dog, s, retrieve, by, remaining, calm, and, quiet, while, the, other, dog, is, working, when, competing, in, conformation, shows, most, kennel, clubs, including, the, kennel, club, group, pedigree, gun, dog, breeds,
