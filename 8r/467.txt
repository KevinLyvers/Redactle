4, 5, see, text, the, arapaima, pirarucu, or, paiche, is, any, large, species, of, bonytongue, in, the, genus, arapaima, native, to, the, amazon, and, essequibo, basins, of, south, america, arapaima, is, the, type, genus, of, the, subfamily, arapaiminae, within, the, family, osteoglossidae, they, are, among, the, world, s, largest, freshwater, fish, reaching, as, much, as, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, in, length, they, are, an, important, food, fish, they, have, declined, in, the, native, range, due, to, overfishing, and, habitat, loss, in, contrast, arapaima, have, been, introduced, to, several, tropical, regions, outside, the, native, range, within, south, america, and, elsewhere, where, they, are, sometimes, considered, invasive, species, in, kerala, india, arapaima, escaped, from, aquaculture, ponds, after, floods, in, 2018, its, portuguese, name, pirarucu, derives, from, the, tupi, language, words, pira, and, urucum, meaning, red, fish, arapaima, was, traditionally, regarded, as, a, monotypic, genus, but, later, several, species, were, distinguished, as, a, consequence, of, this, taxonomic, confusion, most, earlier, studies, were, done, using, the, name, a, gigas, but, this, species, is, only, known, from, old, museum, specimens, and, the, exact, native, range, is, unclear, the, regularly, seen, and, studied, species, is, a, arapaima, although, a, small, number, of, a, leptosoma, also, have, been, recorded, in, the, aquarium, trade, the, remaining, species, are, virtually, unknown, a, agassizii, from, old, detailed, drawings, the, type, specimen, itself, was, lost, during, world, war, ii, bombings, and, a, mapae, from, the, type, specimen, fishbase, recognizes, four, species, in, the, genus, in, addition, to, these, evidence, suggests, that, a, fifth, species, a, arapaima, should, be, recognized, this, being, the, widespread, well, known, species, otherwise, included, in, a, gigas, these, fish, are, widely, dispersed, and, do, not, migrate, which, leads, scientists, to, suppose, that, more, species, are, waiting, to, be, discovered, in, the, depths, of, the, amazon, basin, harbors, sites, such, as, these, offer, the, likelihood, of, diversity, arapaima, can, reach, lengths, more, than, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, some, exceptional, cases, even, exceeding, 2, 6, m, 8, ft, 6, in, and, over, 100, kg, 220, lb, the, maximum, recorded, weight, for, the, species, is, 200, kg, 440, lb, while, the, longest, recorded, length, verified, was, 3, 07, m, 10, ft, 1, in, anecdotal, reports, suggest, that, specimens, as, long, as, 4, 57, m, 15, ft, 0, in, exist, but, verification, is, deemed, impossible, and, thus, considered, questionable, as, a, result, of, overfishing, arapaima, more, than, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, are, seldom, found, in, the, wild, the, arapaima, is, torpedo, shaped, with, large, blackish, green, scales, and, red, markings, it, is, streamlined, and, sleek, with, its, dorsal, and, anal, fins, set, near, its, tail, arapaima, scales, have, a, mineralised, hard, outer, layer, with, a, corrugated, surface, under, which, lie, several, layers, of, collagen, fibres, in, a, bouligand, type, arrangement, in, a, structure, similar, to, plywood, the, fibres, in, each, successive, layer, are, oriented, at, large, angles, to, those, in, the, previous, layer, increasing, toughness, the, hard, corrugated, surface, of, the, outer, layer, and, the, tough, internal, collagen, layers, work, synergistically, to, contribute, to, their, ability, to, flex, and, deform, while, providing, strength, and, protection, a, solution, that, allows, the, fish, to, remain, mobile, while, heavily, armored, the, arapaima, has, a, fundamental, dependence, on, surface, air, to, breathe, in, addition, to, gills, it, has, a, modified, and, enlarged, swim, bladder, composed, of, lung, like, tissue, which, enables, it, to, extract, oxygen, from, the, air, the, diet, of, the, arapaima, consists, of, fish, crustaceans, fruits, seeds, insects, and, small, land, animals, that, walk, near, the, shore, the, fish, is, an, air, breather, using, its, labyrinth, organ, which, is, rich, in, blood, vessels, and, opens, into, the, fish, s, mouth, an, advantage, in, oxygen, deprived, water, that, is, often, found, in, the, amazon, river, this, fish, is, able, to, survive, in, oxbow, lakes, with, dissolved, oxygen, as, low, as, 0, 5, ppm, in, the, wetlands, of, the, araguaia, one, of, the, most, important, refuges, for, this, species, it, is, the, top, predator, in, such, lakes, during, the, low, water, season, when, the, lakes, are, isolated, from, the, rivers, and, oxygen, levels, drop, rendering, its, prey, lethargic, and, vulnerable, arapaima, may, leap, out, of, the, water, if, they, feel, constrained, by, their, environment, or, harassed, due, to, its, geographic, ranges, arapaima, s, lifecycle, is, greatly, affected, by, seasonal, flooding, various, pictures, show, slightly, different, coloring, owing, to, colour, changes, when, they, reproduce, the, arapaima, lays, its, eggs, when, water, levels, are, low, or, beginning, to, rise, they, build, a, nest, about, 50, cm, 20, in, wide, and, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, deep, usually, in, muddy, bottomed, areas, as, the, water, rises, the, eggs, hatch, and, the, offspring, have, the, flood, season, from, may, to, august, in, which, to, prosper, such, that, yearly, spawning, is, regulated, seasonally, the, arapaima, male, is, a, mouthbrooder, like, the, related, osteoglossum, genus, meaning, the, young, are, protected, in, his, mouth, until, they, are, older, the, female, arapaima, helps, to, protect, the, male, and, the, young, by, circling, them, and, fending, off, potential, predators, in, his, book, three, singles, to, adventure, naturalist, gerald, durrell, reported, that, in, british, guyana, female, arapaima, had, been, seen, secreting, a, white, substance, from, a, gland, in, the, head, and, that, their, young, were, seemingly, feeding, on, the, substance, some, 23, million, year, old, fossils, of, arapaima, or, a, very, similar, species, have, been, found, in, the, miocene, villavieja, formation, of, colombia, museum, specimens, are, found, in, france, england, the, united, states, brazil, guyana, ecuador, and, per, this, makes, them, some, of, the, oldest, known, species, of, freshwater, fish, arapaima, is, exploited, in, many, ways, by, local, human, populations, its, tongue, is, thought, to, have, medicinal, qualities, in, south, america, it, is, dried, and, combined, with, guarana, bark, which, is, grated, and, mixed, into, water, doses, are, given, to, kill, intestinal, worms, the, bony, tongue, is, used, to, scrape, cylinders, of, dried, guarana, an, ingredient, in, some, beverages, and, the, bony, scales, are, used, as, nail, files, arapaima, produce, boneless, steaks, and, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, the, amazon, region, locals, often, salt, and, dry, the, meat, rolling, it, into, a, cigar, style, package, that, is, then, tied, and, can, be, stored, without, rotting, which, is, important, in, a, region, with, little, refrigeration, arapaima, are, referred, to, as, the, cod, of, the, amazon, and, can, be, prepared, in, the, same, way, as, traditional, salted, cod, designers, have, begun, using, the, skin, of, the, arapaima, as, leather, to, make, jackets, shoes, and, handbags, and, to, cover, furniture, in, july, 2009, villagers, around, kenyir, lake, in, terengganu, malaysia, reported, sighting, a, gigas, the, kenyir, monster, or, dragon, fish, as, the, locals, call, it, was, claimed, to, be, responsible, for, the, mysterious, drowning, of, two, men, on, 17, june, in, august, 2018, india, times, reported, that, arapaima, has, been, spotted, in, the, chalakudy, river, following, floods, in, kerala, their, presence, in, india, is, attributed, to, illegal, importation, for, fish, farming, wild, arapaima, are, harpooned, or, caught, in, large, nets, since, the, arapaima, needs, to, surface, to, breathe, air, traditional, arapaima, fishermen, harpoon, them, and, then, club, them, to, death, an, individual, fish, can, yield, as, much, as, 70, kg, 150, lb, of, meat, the, arapaima, was, introduced, for, fishing, in, thailand, and, malaysia, fishing, in, thailand, can, be, done, in, several, lakes, where, specimens, over, 150, kg, 330, lb, are, often, landed, and, then, released, on, 14, may, 2020, a, 30, kg, specimen, was, found, floating, in, the, river, in, angkor, wat, area, krovanh, village, sangkat, norkor, thom, siem, reap, the, locals, said, it, was, a, rare, fish, and, not, commonly, seen, in, this, area, with, catch, and, release, after, the, fish, is, landed, it, must, be, held, for, 5, minutes, until, it, takes, a, breath, the, fish, has, a, large, blood, vessel, running, down, its, spine, so, lifting, the, fish, clear, of, the, water, for, trophy, shots, can, rupture, this, vessel, causing, death, in, 2013, whole, foods, began, selling, farm, raised, arapaima, in, the, united, states, as, a, cheaper, alternative, to, halibut, or, chilean, sea, bass, in, thailand, the, only, legal, breeding, farm, is, located, in, tambon, phrong, maduea, amphoe, mueang, nakhon, pathom, nakhon, pathom, province, this, has, been, approved, by, both, the, department, of, fisheries, and, cites, since, early, 2018, and, has, been, exporting, them, worldwide, as, an, aquarium, fish, arapaima, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, overfishing, because, of, their, size, and, because, they, must, surface, periodically, to, breathe, some, 7000, tons, per, year, were, taken, from, 1918, to, 1924, the, height, of, commercial, arapaima, fishing, demand, led, to, farming, of, the, fish, by, native, ribeirinhos, as, efforts, at, restricting, catches, were, largely, unsuccessful, arapaima, fishing, was, banned, outright, in, brazil, in, 1996, due, to, declining, populations, indeed, a, 2014, study, found, that, the, fish, were, depleted, or, overexploited, at, 93, of, the, sites, examined, and, well, managed, or, unfished, in, only, 7, the, fish, appeared, to, be, extirpated, in, 19, of, these, sites, the, status, of, the, arapaima, population, in, the, amazon, river, basin, is, unknown, hence, it, is, listed, on, the, iucn, red, list, as, data, deficient, conducting, a, population, census, in, so, large, an, area, is, difficult, as, is, monitoring, catches, in, a, trade, that, was, once, largely, unregulated, since, 1999, both, subsistence, and, commercial, fishing, have, been, permitted, in, specially, designated, areas, under, a, sophisticated, sustainable, management, strategy, this, approach, has, led, to, massive, recovery, of, once, depleted, stocks, in, a, sampling, of, 10, areas, conducted, using, traditional, counting, methods, the, population, was, found, to, have, grown, from, 2, 500, in, 1999, to, over, 170, 000, in, 2017, colombia, only, bans, fishing, and, consumption, of, the, arapaima, between, october, 1, and, march, 15, during, breeding, season
