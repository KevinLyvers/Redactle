pteropidae, gray, 1821, pteropodina, c, l, bonaparte, 1837, megabats, constitute, the, family, pteropodidae, of, the, order, chiroptera, bats, they, are, also, called, fruit, bats, old, world, fruit, bats, or, especially, the, genera, acerodon, and, pteropus, flying, foxes, they, are, the, only, member, of, the, superfamily, pteropodoidea, which, is, one, of, two, superfamilies, in, the, suborder, yinpterochiroptera, internal, divisions, of, pteropodidae, have, varied, since, subfamilies, were, first, proposed, in, 1917, from, three, subfamilies, in, the, 1917, classification, six, are, now, recognized, along, with, various, tribes, as, of, 2018, 197, species, of, megabat, had, been, described, the, leading, theory, of, the, evolution, of, megabats, has, been, determined, primarily, by, genetic, data, as, the, fossil, record, for, this, family, is, the, most, fragmented, of, all, bats, they, likely, evolved, in, australasia, with, the, common, ancestor, of, all, living, pteropodids, existing, approximately, 31, million, years, ago, many, of, their, lineages, probably, originated, in, melanesia, then, dispersed, over, time, to, mainland, asia, the, mediterranean, and, africa, today, they, are, found, in, tropical, and, subtropical, areas, of, eurasia, africa, and, oceania, the, megabat, family, contains, the, largest, bat, species, with, individuals, of, some, species, weighing, up, to, 1, 45, kg, 3, 2, lb, and, having, wingspans, up, to, 1, 7, m, 5, 6, ft, not, all, megabats, are, large, bodied, nearly, a, third, of, all, species, weigh, less, than, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, they, can, be, differentiated, from, other, bats, due, to, their, dog, like, faces, clawed, second, digits, and, reduced, uropatagium, a, small, number, of, species, have, tails, megabats, have, several, adaptations, for, flight, including, rapid, oxygen, consumption, the, ability, to, sustain, heart, rates, of, more, than, 700, beats, per, minute, and, large, lung, volumes, most, megabats, are, nocturnal, or, crepuscular, although, a, few, species, are, active, during, the, daytime, during, the, period, of, inactivity, they, roost, in, trees, or, caves, members, of, some, species, roost, alone, while, others, form, colonies, of, up, to, a, million, individuals, during, the, period, of, activity, they, use, flight, to, travel, to, food, resources, with, few, exceptions, they, are, unable, to, echolocate, relying, instead, on, keen, senses, of, sight, and, smell, to, navigate, and, locate, food, most, species, are, primarily, frugivorous, and, several, are, nectarivorous, other, less, common, food, resources, include, leaves, pollen, twigs, and, bark, they, reach, sexual, maturity, slowly, and, have, a, low, reproductive, output, most, species, have, one, offspring, at, a, time, after, a, pregnancy, of, four, to, six, months, this, low, reproductive, output, means, that, after, a, population, loss, their, numbers, are, slow, to, rebound, a, quarter, of, all, species, are, listed, as, threatened, mainly, due, to, habitat, destruction, and, overhunting, megabats, are, a, popular, food, source, in, some, areas, leading, to, population, declines, and, extinction, they, are, also, of, interest, to, those, involved, in, public, health, as, they, are, natural, reservoirs, of, several, viruses, that, can, affect, humans, pteropodinae, nyctimeninae, cynopterinae, eidolinae, scotonycterini, eonycterini, rousettini, stenonycterini, plerotini, myonycterini, epomophorini, the, family, pteropodidae, was, first, described, in, 1821, by, british, zoologist, john, edward, gray, he, named, the, family, pteropidae, after, the, genus, pteropus, and, placed, it, within, the, now, defunct, order, fructivorae, fructivorae, contained, one, other, family, the, now, defunct, cephalotidae, containing, one, genus, cephalotes, now, recognized, as, a, synonym, of, dobsonia, gray, s, spelling, was, possibly, based, on, a, misunderstanding, of, the, suffix, of, pteropus, pteropus, comes, from, ancient, greek, pter, n, meaning, wing, and, po, s, meaning, foot, the, greek, word, pous, of, pteropus, is, from, the, stem, word, pod, therefore, latinizing, pteropus, correctly, results, in, the, prefix, pteropod, 230, french, biologist, charles, lucien, bonaparte, was, the, first, to, use, the, corrected, spelling, pteropodidae, in, 1838, 230, in, 1875, the, zoologist, george, edward, dobson, was, the, first, to, split, the, order, chiroptera, bats, into, two, suborders, megachiroptera, sometimes, listed, as, macrochiroptera, and, microchiroptera, which, are, commonly, abbreviated, to, megabats, and, microbats, dobson, selected, these, names, to, allude, to, the, body, size, differences, of, the, two, groups, with, many, fruit, eating, bats, being, larger, than, insect, eating, bats, pteropodidae, was, the, only, family, he, included, within, megachiroptera, a, 2001, study, found, that, the, dichotomy, of, megabats, and, microbats, did, not, accurately, reflect, their, evolutionary, relationships, instead, of, megachiroptera, and, microchiroptera, the, study, s, authors, proposed, the, new, suborders, yinpterochiroptera, and, yangochiroptera, this, classification, scheme, has, been, verified, several, times, subsequently, and, remains, widely, supported, as, of, 2019, since, 2005, this, suborder, has, alternatively, been, called, pteropodiformes, 520, 521, yinpterochiroptera, contained, species, formerly, included, in, megachiroptera, all, of, pteropodidae, as, well, as, several, families, formerly, included, in, microchiroptera, megadermatidae, rhinolophidae, nycteridae, craseonycteridae, and, rhinopomatidae, two, superfamilies, comprise, yinpterochiroptera, rhinolophoidea, containing, the, above, families, formerly, in, microchiroptera, and, pteropodoidea, which, only, contains, pteropodidae, in, 1917, danish, mammalogist, knud, andersen, divided, pteropodidae, into, three, subfamilies, macroglossinae, pteropinae, corrected, to, pteropodinae, and, harpyionycterinae, 496, a, 1995, study, found, that, macroglossinae, as, previously, defined, containing, the, genera, eonycteris, notopteris, macroglossus, syconycteris, melonycteris, and, megaloglossus, was, paraphyletic, meaning, that, the, subfamily, did, not, group, all, the, descendants, of, a, common, ancestor, 214, subsequent, publications, consider, macroglossini, as, a, tribe, within, pteropodinae, that, contains, only, macroglossus, and, syconycteris, eonycteris, and, melonycteris, are, within, other, tribes, in, pteropodinae, megaloglossus, was, placed, in, the, tribe, myonycterini, of, the, subfamily, rousettinae, and, notopteris, is, of, uncertain, placement, other, subfamilies, and, tribes, within, pteropodidae, have, also, undergone, changes, since, andersen, s, 1917, publication, in, 1997, the, pteropodids, were, classified, into, six, subfamilies, and, nine, tribes, based, on, their, morphology, or, physical, characteristics, a, 2011, genetic, study, concluded, that, some, of, these, subfamilies, were, paraphyletic, and, therefore, they, did, not, accurately, depict, the, relationships, among, megabat, species, three, of, the, subfamilies, proposed, in, 1997, based, on, morphology, received, support, cynopterinae, harpyionycterinae, and, nyctimeninae, the, other, three, clades, recovered, in, this, study, consisted, of, macroglossini, epomophorinae, rousettini, and, pteropodini, melonycteris, a, 2016, genetic, study, focused, only, on, african, pteropodids, harpyionycterinae, rousettinae, and, epomophorinae, also, challenged, the, 1997, classification, all, species, formerly, included, in, epomophorinae, were, moved, to, rousettinae, which, was, subdivided, into, additional, tribes, the, genus, eidolon, formerly, in, the, tribe, rousettini, of, rousettinae, was, moved, to, its, own, subfamily, eidolinae, in, 1984, an, additional, pteropodid, subfamily, propottininae, was, proposed, representing, one, extinct, species, described, from, a, fossil, discovered, in, africa, propotto, leakeyi, in, 2018, the, fossils, were, reexamined, and, determined, to, represent, a, lemur, as, of, 2018, there, were, 197, described, species, of, megabat, around, a, third, of, which, are, flying, foxes, of, the, genus, pteropus, the, fossil, record, for, pteropodid, bats, is, the, most, incomplete, of, any, bat, family, although, the, poor, skeletal, record, of, chiroptera, is, probably, from, how, fragile, bat, skeletons, are, pteropodidae, still, have, the, most, incomplete, despite, generally, having, the, biggest, and, most, sturdy, skeletons, it, is, also, surprising, that, pteropodidae, are, the, least, represented, because, they, were, the, first, major, group, to, diverge, several, factors, could, explain, why, so, few, pteropodid, fossils, have, been, discovered, tropical, regions, where, their, fossils, might, be, found, are, under, sampled, relative, to, europe, and, north, america, conditions, for, fossilization, are, poor, in, the, tropics, which, could, lead, to, fewer, fossils, overall, and, even, when, fossils, are, formed, they, may, be, destroyed, by, subsequent, geological, activity, it, is, estimated, that, more, than, 98, of, pteropodid, fossil, history, is, missing, even, without, fossils, the, age, and, divergence, times, of, the, family, can, still, be, estimated, by, using, computational, phylogenetics, pteropodidae, split, from, the, superfamily, rhinolophoidea, which, contains, all, the, other, families, of, the, suborder, yinpterochiroptera, approximately, 58, mya, million, years, ago, the, ancestor, of, the, crown, group, of, pteropodidae, or, all, living, species, lived, approximately, 31, mya, the, family, pteropodidae, likely, originated, in, australasia, based, on, biogeographic, reconstructions, other, biogeographic, analyses, have, suggested, that, the, melanesian, islands, including, new, guinea, are, a, plausible, candidate, for, the, origin, of, most, megabat, subfamilies, with, the, exception, of, cynopterinae, the, cynopterines, likely, originated, on, the, sunda, shelf, based, on, results, of, a, weighted, ancestral, area, analysis, of, six, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, genes, from, these, regions, pteropodids, colonized, other, areas, including, continental, asia, and, africa, megabats, reached, africa, in, at, least, four, distinct, events, the, four, proposed, events, are, represented, by, 1, scotonycteris, 2, rousettus, 3, scotonycterini, and, 4, the, endemic, africa, clade, which, includes, stenonycterini, plerotini, myonycterini, and, epomophorini, according, to, a, 2016, study, it, is, unknown, when, megabats, reached, africa, but, several, tribes, scotonycterini, stenonycterini, plerotini, myonycterini, and, epomophorini, were, present, by, the, late, miocene, how, megabats, reached, africa, is, also, unknown, it, has, been, proposed, that, they, could, have, arrived, via, the, middle, east, before, it, became, more, arid, at, the, end, of, the, miocene, conversely, they, could, have, reached, the, continent, via, the, gomphotherium, land, bridge, which, connected, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, to, eurasia, the, genus, pteropus, flying, foxes, which, is, not, found, on, mainland, africa, is, proposed, to, have, dispersed, from, melanesia, via, island, hopping, across, the, indian, ocean, this, is, less, likely, for, other, megabat, genera, which, have, smaller, body, sizes, and, thus, have, more, limited, flight, capabilities, megabats, are, the, only, family, of, bats, incapable, of, laryngeal, echolocation, it, is, unclear, whether, the, common, ancestor, of, all, bats, was, capable, of, echolocation, and, thus, echolocation, was, lost, in, the, megabat, lineage, or, multiple, bat, lineages, independently, evolved, the, ability, to, echolocate, the, superfamily, rhinolophoidea, and, the, suborder, yangochiroptera, this, unknown, element, of, bat, evolution, has, been, called, a, grand, challenge, in, biology, a, 2017, study, of, bat, ontogeny, embryonic, development, found, evidence, that, megabat, embryos, at, first, have, large, developed, cochlea, similar, to, echolocating, microbats, though, at, birth, they, have, small, cochlea, similar, to, non, echolocating, mammals, this, evidence, supports, that, laryngeal, echolocation, evolved, once, among, bats, and, was, lost, in, pteropodids, rather, than, evolving, twice, independently, megabats, in, the, genus, rousettus, are, capable, of, primitive, echolocation, through, clicking, their, tongues, some, species, the, cave, nectar, bat, eonycteris, spelaea, lesser, short, nosed, fruit, bat, cynopterus, brachyotis, and, the, long, tongued, fruit, bat, macroglossus, sobrinus, have, been, shown, to, create, clicks, similar, to, those, of, echolocating, bats, using, their, wings, both, echolocation, and, flight, are, energetically, expensive, processes, echolocating, bats, couple, sound, production, with, the, mechanisms, engaged, for, flight, allowing, them, to, reduce, the, additional, energy, burden, of, echolocation, instead, of, pressurizing, a, bolus, of, air, for, the, production, of, sound, laryngeally, echolocating, bats, likely, use, the, force, of, the, downbeat, of, their, wings, to, pressurize, the, air, cutting, energetic, costs, by, synchronizing, wingbeats, and, echolocation, the, loss, of, echolocation, or, conversely, the, lack, of, its, evolution, may, be, due, to, the, uncoupling, of, flight, and, echolocation, in, megabats, the, larger, average, body, size, of, megabats, compared, to, echolocating, bats, suggests, a, larger, body, size, disrupts, the, flight, echolocation, coupling, and, made, echolocation, too, energetically, expensive, to, be, conserved, in, megabats, the, family, pteropodidae, is, divided, into, six, subfamilies, represented, by, 46, genera, family, pteropodidae, megabats, take, their, name, from, their, larger, weight, and, size, the, largest, the, great, flying, fox, pteropus, neohibernicus, weighs, up, to, 1, 6, kg, 3, 5, lb, some, members, of, acerodon, and, pteropus, have, wingspans, reaching, up, to, 1, 7, m, 5, 6, ft, 48, despite, the, fact, that, body, size, was, a, defining, characteristic, that, dobson, used, to, separate, microbats, and, megabats, not, all, species, of, megabat, are, larger, than, microbats, the, spotted, winged, fruit, bat, balionycteris, maculata, a, megabat, weighs, only, 14, 2, g, 0, 50, oz, the, flying, foxes, of, pteropus, and, acerodon, are, often, taken, as, exemplars, of, the, whole, family, in, terms, of, body, size, in, reality, these, genera, are, outliers, creating, a, misconception, of, the, true, size, of, most, megabat, species, a, 2004, review, stated, that, 28, of, megabat, species, weigh, less, than, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, megabats, can, be, distinguished, from, microbats, in, appearance, by, their, dog, like, faces, by, the, presence, of, claws, on, the, second, digit, see, megabat, postcrania, and, by, their, simple, ears, the, simple, appearance, of, the, ear, is, due, in, part, to, the, lack, of, tragi, cartilage, flaps, projecting, in, front, of, the, ear, canal, which, are, found, in, many, microbat, species, megabats, of, the, genus, nyctimene, appear, less, dog, like, with, shorter, faces, and, tubular, nostrils, a, 2011, study, of, 167, megabat, species, found, that, while, the, majority, 63, have, fur, that, is, a, uniform, color, other, patterns, are, seen, in, this, family, these, include, countershading, in, four, percent, of, species, a, neck, band, or, mantle, in, five, percent, of, species, stripes, in, ten, percent, of, species, and, spots, in, nineteen, percent, of, species, unlike, microbats, megabats, have, a, greatly, reduced, uropatagium, which, is, an, expanse, of, flight, membrane, that, runs, between, the, hind, limbs, additionally, the, tail, is, absent, or, greatly, reduced, with, the, exception, of, notopteris, species, which, have, a, long, tail, most, megabat, wings, insert, laterally, attach, to, the, body, directly, at, the, sides, in, dobsonia, species, the, wings, attach, nearer, the, spine, giving, them, the, common, name, of, bare, backed, or, naked, backed, fruit, bats, megabats, have, large, orbits, which, are, bordered, by, well, developed, postorbital, processes, posteriorly, the, postorbital, processes, sometimes, join, to, form, the, postorbital, bar, the, snout, is, simple, in, appearance, and, not, highly, modified, as, is, seen, in, other, bat, families, the, length, of, the, snout, varies, among, genera, the, premaxilla, is, well, developed, and, usually, free, meaning, that, it, is, not, fused, with, the, maxilla, instead, it, articulates, with, the, maxilla, via, ligaments, making, it, freely, movable, the, premaxilla, always, lack, a, palatal, branch, in, species, with, a, longer, snout, the, skull, is, usually, arched, in, genera, with, shorter, faces, penthetor, nyctimene, dobsonia, and, myonycteris, the, skull, has, little, to, no, bending, the, number, of, teeth, varies, among, megabat, species, totals, for, various, species, range, from, 24, to, 34, all, megabats, have, two, or, four, each, of, upper, and, lower, incisors, with, the, exception, bulmer, s, fruit, bat, aproteles, bulmerae, which, completely, lacks, incisors, and, the, s, o, tom, collared, fruit, bat, myonycteris, brachycephala, which, has, two, upper, and, three, lower, incisors, this, makes, it, the, only, mammal, species, with, an, asymmetrical, dental, formula, all, species, have, two, upper, and, lower, canine, teeth, the, number, of, premolars, is, variable, with, four, or, six, each, of, upper, and, lower, premolars, the, first, upper, and, lower, molars, are, always, present, meaning, that, all, megabats, have, at, least, four, molars, the, remaining, molars, may, be, present, present, but, reduced, or, absent, megabat, molars, and, premolars, are, simplified, with, a, reduction, in, the, cusps, and, ridges, resulting, in, a, more, flattened, crown, like, most, mammals, megabats, are, diphyodont, meaning, that, the, young, have, a, set, of, deciduous, teeth, milk, teeth, that, falls, out, and, is, replaced, by, permanent, teeth, for, most, species, there, are, 20, deciduous, teeth, as, is, typical, for, mammals, the, deciduous, set, does, not, include, molars, the, scapulae, shoulder, blades, of, megabats, have, been, described, as, the, most, primitive, of, any, chiropteran, family, the, shoulder, is, overall, of, simple, construction, but, has, some, specialized, features, the, primitive, insertion, of, the, omohyoid, muscle, from, the, clavicle, collarbone, to, the, scapula, is, laterally, displaced, more, towards, the, side, of, the, body, a, feature, also, seen, in, the, phyllostomidae, the, shoulder, also, has, a, well, developed, system, of, muscular, slips, narrow, bands, of, muscle, that, augment, larger, muscles, that, anchor, the, tendon, of, the, occipitopollicalis, muscle, muscle, in, bats, that, runs, from, base, of, neck, to, the, base, of, the, thumb, to, the, skin, while, microbats, only, have, claws, on, the, thumbs, of, their, forelimbs, most, megabats, have, a, clawed, second, digit, as, well, only, eonycteris, dobsonia, notopteris, and, neopteryx, lack, the, second, claw, the, first, digit, is, the, shortest, while, the, third, digit, is, the, longest, the, second, digit, is, incapable, of, flexion, megabats, thumbs, are, longer, relative, to, their, forelimbs, than, those, of, microbats, megabats, hindlimbs, have, the, same, skeletal, components, as, humans, most, megabat, species, have, an, additional, structure, called, the, calcar, a, cartilage, spur, arising, from, the, calcaneus, some, authors, alternately, refer, to, this, structure, as, the, uropatagial, spur, to, differentiate, it, from, microbats, calcars, which, are, structured, differently, the, structure, exists, to, stabilize, the, uropatagium, allowing, bats, to, adjust, the, camber, of, the, membrane, during, flight, megabats, lacking, the, calcar, or, spur, include, notopteris, syconycteris, and, harpyionycteris, the, entire, leg, is, rotated, at, the, hip, compared, to, normal, mammal, orientation, meaning, that, the, knees, face, posteriorly, all, five, digits, of, the, foot, flex, in, the, direction, of, the, sagittal, plane, with, no, digit, capable, of, flexing, in, the, opposite, direction, as, in, the, feet, of, perching, birds, flight, is, very, energetically, expensive, requiring, several, adaptations, to, the, cardiovascular, system, during, flight, bats, can, raise, their, oxygen, consumption, by, twenty, times, or, more, for, sustained, periods, human, athletes, can, achieve, an, increase, of, a, factor, of, twenty, for, a, few, minutes, at, most, a, 1994, study, of, the, straw, coloured, fruit, bat, eidolon, helvum, and, hammer, headed, bat, hypsignathus, monstrosus, found, a, mean, respiratory, exchange, ratio, carbon, dioxide, produced, oxygen, used, of, approximately, 0, 78, among, these, two, species, the, gray, headed, flying, fox, pteropus, poliocephalus, and, the, egyptian, fruit, bat, rousettus, aegyptiacus, maximum, heart, rates, in, flight, varied, between, 476, beats, per, minute, gray, headed, flying, fox, and, 728, beats, per, minute, egyptian, fruit, bat, the, maximum, number, of, breaths, per, minute, ranged, from, 163, gray, headed, flying, fox, to, 316, straw, colored, fruit, bat, additionally, megabats, have, exceptionally, large, lung, volumes, relative, to, their, sizes, while, terrestrial, mammals, such, as, shrews, have, a, lung, volume, of, 0, 03, cm, 3, per, gram, of, body, weight, 0, 05, in, 3, per, ounce, of, body, weight, species, such, as, the, wahlberg, s, epauletted, fruit, bat, epomophorus, wahlbergi, have, lung, volumes, 4, 3, times, greater, at, 0, 13, cm, 3, per, gram, 0, 22, in, 3, per, ounce, megabats, have, rapid, digestive, systems, with, a, gut, transit, time, of, half, an, hour, or, less, the, digestive, system, is, structured, to, a, herbivorous, diet, sometimes, restricted, to, soft, fruit, or, nectar, the, length, of, the, digestive, system, is, short, for, a, herbivore, as, well, as, shorter, than, those, of, insectivorous, microchiropterans, as, the, fibrous, content, is, mostly, separated, by, the, action, of, the, palate, tongue, and, teeth, and, then, discarded, many, megabats, have, u, shaped, stomachs, there, is, no, distinct, difference, between, the, small, and, large, intestine, nor, a, distinct, beginning, of, the, rectum, they, have, very, high, densities, of, intestinal, microvilli, which, creates, a, large, surface, area, for, the, absorption, of, nutrients, like, all, bats, megabats, have, much, smaller, genomes, than, other, mammals, a, 2009, study, of, 43, megabat, species, found, that, their, genomes, ranged, from, 1, 86, picograms, pg, 978, mbp, per, pg, in, the, straw, colored, fruit, bat, to, 2, 51, pg, in, lyle, s, flying, fox, pteropus, lylei, all, values, were, much, lower, than, the, mammalian, average, of, 3, 5, pg, megabats, have, even, smaller, genomes, than, microbats, with, a, mean, weight, of, 2, 20, pg, compared, to, 2, 58, pg, it, was, speculated, that, this, difference, could, be, related, to, the, fact, that, the, megabat, lineage, has, experienced, an, extinction, of, the, line1, a, type, of, long, interspersed, nuclear, element, line1, constitutes, 15, 20, of, the, human, genome, and, is, considered, the, most, prevalent, long, interspersed, nuclear, element, among, mammals, with, very, few, exceptions, megabats, do, not, echolocate, and, therefore, rely, on, sight, and, smell, to, navigate, they, have, large, eyes, positioned, at, the, front, of, their, heads, these, are, larger, than, those, of, the, common, ancestor, of, all, bats, with, one, study, suggesting, a, trend, of, increasing, eye, size, among, pteropodids, a, study, that, examined, the, eyes, of, 18, megabat, species, determined, that, the, common, blossom, bat, syconycteris, australis, had, the, smallest, eyes, at, a, diameter, of, 5, 03, mm, 0, 198, in, while, the, largest, eyes, were, those, of, large, flying, fox, pteropus, vampyrus, at, 12, 34, mm, 0, 486, in, in, diameter, megabat, irises, are, usually, brown, but, they, can, be, red, or, orange, as, in, desmalopex, mirimiri, pteralopex, and, some, pteropus, at, high, brightness, levels, megabat, visual, acuity, is, poorer, than, that, of, humans, at, low, brightness, it, is, superior, one, study, that, examined, the, eyes, of, some, rousettus, epomophorus, eidolon, and, pteropus, species, determined, that, the, first, three, genera, possess, a, tapetum, lucidum, a, reflective, structure, in, the, eyes, that, improves, vision, at, low, light, levels, while, the, pteropus, species, do, not, all, species, examined, had, retinae, with, both, rod, cells, and, cone, cells, but, only, the, pteropus, species, had, s, cones, which, detect, the, shortest, wavelengths, of, light, because, the, spectral, tuning, of, the, opsins, was, not, discernible, it, is, unclear, whether, the, s, cones, of, pteropus, species, detect, blue, or, ultraviolet, light, pteropus, bats, are, dichromatic, possessing, two, kinds, of, cone, cells, the, other, three, genera, with, their, lack, of, s, cones, are, monochromatic, unable, to, see, color, all, genera, had, very, high, densities, of, rod, cells, resulting, in, high, sensitivity, to, light, which, corresponds, with, their, nocturnal, activity, patterns, in, pteropus, and, rousettus, measured, rod, cell, densities, were, 350, 000, 800, 000, per, square, millimeter, equal, to, or, exceeding, other, nocturnal, or, crepuscular, animals, such, as, the, house, mouse, domestic, cat, and, domestic, rabbit, megabats, use, smell, to, find, food, sources, like, fruit, and, nectar, they, have, keen, senses, of, smell, that, rival, that, of, the, domestic, dog, tube, nosed, fruit, bats, such, as, the, eastern, tube, nosed, bat, nyctimene, robinsoni, have, stereo, olfaction, meaning, they, are, able, to, map, and, follow, odor, plumes, three, dimensionally, along, with, most, or, perhaps, all, other, bat, species, megabats, mothers, and, offspring, also, use, scent, to, recognize, each, other, as, well, as, for, recognition, of, individuals, in, flying, foxes, males, have, enlarged, androgen, sensitive, sebaceous, glands, on, their, shoulders, they, use, for, scent, marking, their, territories, particularly, during, the, mating, season, the, secretions, of, these, glands, vary, by, species, of, the, 65, chemical, compounds, isolated, from, the, glands, of, four, species, no, compound, was, found, in, all, species, males, also, engage, in, urine, washing, or, coating, themselves, in, their, own, urine, megabats, possess, the, tas1r2, gene, meaning, they, have, the, ability, to, detect, sweetness, in, foods, this, gene, is, present, among, all, bats, except, vampire, bats, like, all, other, bats, megabats, cannot, taste, umami, due, to, the, absence, of, the, tas1r1, gene, among, other, mammals, only, giant, pandas, have, been, shown, to, lack, this, gene, megabats, also, have, multiple, tas2r, genes, indicating, that, they, can, taste, bitterness, megabats, like, all, bats, are, long, lived, relative, to, their, size, for, mammals, some, captive, megabats, have, had, lifespans, exceeding, thirty, years, relative, to, their, sizes, megabats, have, low, reproductive, outputs, and, delayed, sexual, maturity, with, females, of, most, species, not, giving, birth, until, the, age, of, one, or, two, 6, some, megabats, appear, to, be, able, to, breed, throughout, the, year, but, the, majority, of, species, are, likely, seasonal, breeders, mating, occurs, at, the, roost, gestation, length, is, variable, but, is, four, to, six, months, in, most, species, different, species, of, megabats, have, reproductive, adaptations, that, lengthen, the, period, between, copulation, and, giving, birth, some, species, such, as, the, straw, colored, fruit, bat, have, the, reproductive, adaptation, of, delayed, implantation, meaning, that, copulation, occurs, in, june, or, july, but, the, zygote, does, not, implant, into, the, uterine, wall, until, months, later, in, november, 6, the, fischer, s, pygmy, fruit, bat, haplonycteris, fischeri, with, the, adaptation, of, post, implantation, delay, has, the, longest, gestation, length, of, any, bat, species, at, up, to, 11, 5, months, the, post, implantation, delay, means, that, development, of, the, embryo, is, suspended, for, up, to, eight, months, after, implantation, in, the, uterine, wall, which, is, responsible, for, its, very, long, pregnancies, 6, shorter, gestation, lengths, are, found, in, the, greater, short, nosed, fruit, bat, cynopterus, sphinx, with, a, period, of, three, months, the, litter, size, of, all, megabats, is, usually, one, 6, there, are, scarce, records, of, twins, in, the, following, species, madagascan, flying, fox, pteropus, rufus, dobson, s, epauletted, fruit, bat, epomops, dobsoni, the, gray, headed, flying, fox, the, black, flying, fox, pteropus, alecto, the, spectacled, flying, fox, pteropus, conspicillatus, the, greater, short, nosed, fruit, bat, peters, s, epauletted, fruit, bat, epomophorus, crypturus, the, hammer, headed, bat, the, straw, colored, fruit, bat, the, little, collared, fruit, bat, myonycteris, torquata, the, egyptian, fruit, bat, and, leschenault, s, rousette, rousettus, leschenaultii, 85, 87, in, the, cases, of, twins, it, is, rare, that, both, offspring, survive, because, megabats, like, all, bats, have, low, reproductive, rates, their, populations, are, slow, to, recover, from, declines, at, birth, megabat, offspring, are, on, average, 17, 5, of, their, mother, s, post, partum, weight, this, is, the, smallest, offspring, to, mother, ratio, for, any, bat, family, across, all, bats, newborns, are, 22, 3, of, their, mother, s, post, partum, weight, megabat, offspring, are, not, easily, categorized, into, the, traditional, categories, of, altricial, helpless, at, birth, or, precocial, capable, at, birth, species, such, as, the, greater, short, nosed, fruit, bat, are, born, with, their, eyes, open, a, sign, of, precocial, offspring, whereas, the, egyptian, fruit, bat, offspring, s, eyes, do, not, open, until, nine, days, after, birth, a, sign, of, altricial, offspring, as, with, nearly, all, bat, species, males, do, not, assist, females, in, parental, care, the, young, stay, with, their, mothers, until, they, are, weaned, how, long, weaning, takes, varies, throughout, the, family, megabats, like, all, bats, have, relatively, long, nursing, periods, offspring, will, nurse, until, they, are, approximately, 71, of, adult, body, mass, compared, to, 40, of, adult, body, mass, in, non, bat, mammals, species, in, the, genus, micropteropus, wean, their, young, by, seven, to, eight, weeks, of, age, whereas, the, indian, flying, fox, pteropus, medius, does, not, wean, its, young, until, five, months, of, age, very, unusually, male, individuals, of, two, megabat, species, the, bismarck, masked, flying, fox, pteropus, capistratus, and, the, dayak, fruit, bat, dyacopterus, spadiceus, have, been, observed, producing, milk, but, there, has, never, been, an, observation, of, a, male, nursing, young, it, is, unclear, if, the, lactation, is, functional, and, males, actually, nurse, pups, or, if, it, is, a, result, of, stress, or, malnutrition, many, megabat, species, are, highly, gregarious, or, social, megabats, will, vocalize, to, communicate, with, each, other, creating, noises, described, as, trill, like, bursts, of, sound, honking, or, loud, bleat, like, calls, in, various, genera, at, least, one, species, the, egyptian, fruit, bat, is, capable, of, a, kind, of, vocal, learning, called, vocal, production, learning, defined, as, the, ability, to, modify, vocalizations, in, response, to, interactions, with, conspecifics, young, egyptian, fruit, bats, are, capable, of, acquiring, a, dialect, by, listening, to, their, mothers, as, well, as, other, individuals, in, their, colonies, it, has, been, postulated, that, these, dialect, differences, may, result, in, individuals, of, different, colonies, communicating, at, different, frequencies, for, instance, megabat, social, behavior, includes, using, sexual, behaviors, for, more, than, just, reproduction, evidence, suggests, that, female, egyptian, fruit, bats, take, food, from, males, in, exchange, for, sex, paternity, tests, confirmed, that, the, males, from, which, each, female, scrounged, food, had, a, greater, likelihood, of, fathering, the, scrounging, female, s, offspring, homosexual, fellatio, has, been, observed, in, at, least, one, species, the, bonin, flying, fox, pteropus, pselaphon, this, same, sex, fellatio, is, hypothesized, to, encourage, colony, formation, of, otherwise, antagonistic, males, in, colder, climates, megabats, are, mostly, nocturnal, and, crepuscular, though, some, have, been, observed, flying, during, the, day, a, few, island, species, and, subspecies, are, diurnal, hypothesized, as, a, response, to, a, lack, of, predators, diurnal, taxa, include, a, subspecies, of, the, black, eared, flying, fox, pteropus, melanotus, natalis, the, mauritian, flying, fox, pteropus, niger, the, caroline, flying, fox, pteropus, molossinus, a, subspecies, of, pteropus, pelagicus, p, p, insularis, and, the, seychelles, fruit, bat, pteropus, seychellensis, 9, a, 1992, summary, of, forty, one, megabat, genera, noted, that, twenty, nine, are, tree, roosting, genera, a, further, eleven, genera, roost, in, caves, and, the, remaining, six, genera, roost, in, other, kinds, of, sites, human, structures, mines, and, crevices, for, example, tree, roosting, species, can, be, solitary, or, highly, colonial, forming, aggregations, of, up, to, one, million, individuals, cave, roosting, species, form, aggregations, ranging, from, ten, individuals, up, to, several, thousand, highly, colonial, species, often, exhibit, roost, fidelity, meaning, that, their, trees, or, caves, may, be, used, as, roosts, for, many, years, solitary, species, or, those, that, aggregate, in, smaller, numbers, have, less, fidelity, to, their, roosts, 2, most, megabats, are, primarily, frugivorous, throughout, the, family, a, diverse, array, of, fruit, is, consumed, from, nearly, 188, plant, genera, some, species, are, also, nectarivorous, meaning, that, they, also, drink, nectar, from, flowers, in, australia, eucalyptus, flowers, are, an, especially, important, food, source, other, food, resources, include, leaves, shoots, buds, pollen, seed, pods, sap, cones, bark, and, twigs, they, are, prodigious, eaters, and, can, consume, up, to, 2, 5, times, their, own, body, weight, in, fruit, per, night, megabats, fly, to, roosting, and, foraging, resources, they, typically, fly, straight, and, relatively, fast, for, bats, some, species, are, slower, with, greater, maneuverability, species, can, commute, 20, 50, km, 12, 31, mi, in, a, night, migratory, species, of, the, genera, eidolon, pteropus, epomophorus, rousettus, myonycteris, and, nanonycteris, can, migrate, distances, up, to, 750, km, 470, mi, most, megabats, have, below, average, aspect, ratios, which, is, measurement, relating, wingspan, and, wing, area, 348, wing, loading, which, measures, weight, relative, to, wing, area, 348, is, average, or, higher, than, average, in, megabats, megabats, play, an, important, role, in, seed, dispersal, as, a, result, of, their, long, evolutionary, history, some, plants, have, evolved, characteristics, compatible, with, bat, senses, including, fruits, that, are, strongly, scented, brightly, colored, and, prominently, exposed, away, from, foliage, the, bright, colors, and, positioning, of, the, fruit, may, reflect, megabats, reliance, on, visual, cues, and, inability, to, navigate, through, clutter, in, a, study, that, examined, the, fruits, of, more, than, forty, fig, species, only, one, fig, species, was, consumed, by, both, birds, and, megabats, most, species, are, consumed, by, one, or, the, other, bird, consumed, figs, are, frequently, red, or, orange, while, megabat, consumed, figs, are, often, yellow, or, green, most, seeds, are, excreted, shortly, after, consumption, due, to, a, rapid, gut, transit, time, but, some, seeds, can, remain, in, the, gut, for, more, than, twelve, hours, this, heightens, megabats, capacity, to, disperse, seeds, far, from, parent, trees, as, highly, mobile, frugivores, megabats, have, the, capacity, to, restore, forest, between, isolated, forest, fragments, by, dispersing, tree, seeds, to, deforested, landscapes, this, dispersal, ability, is, limited, to, plants, with, small, seeds, that, are, less, than, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, in, length, as, seeds, larger, than, this, are, not, ingested, megabats, especially, those, living, on, islands, have, few, native, predators, species, like, the, small, flying, fox, pteropus, hypomelanus, have, no, known, natural, predators, non, native, predators, of, flying, foxes, include, domestic, cats, and, rats, the, mangrove, monitor, which, is, a, native, predator, for, some, megabat, species, but, an, introduced, predator, for, others, opportunistically, preys, on, megabats, as, it, is, a, capable, tree, climber, another, species, the, brown, tree, snake, can, seriously, impact, megabat, populations, as, a, non, native, predator, in, guam, the, snake, consumes, so, many, offspring, that, it, reduced, the, recruitment, of, the, population, of, the, mariana, fruit, bat, pteropus, mariannus, to, essentially, zero, the, island, is, now, considered, a, sink, for, the, mariana, fruit, bat, as, its, population, there, relies, on, bats, immigrating, from, the, nearby, island, of, rota, to, bolster, it, rather, than, successful, reproduction, predators, that, are, naturally, sympatric, with, megabats, include, reptiles, such, as, crocodilians, snakes, and, large, lizards, as, well, as, birds, like, falcons, hawks, and, owls, 5, the, saltwater, crocodile, is, a, known, predator, of, megabats, based, on, analysis, of, crocodile, stomach, contents, in, northern, australia, during, extreme, heat, events, megabats, like, the, little, red, flying, fox, pteropus, scapulatus, must, cool, off, and, rehydrate, by, drinking, from, waterways, making, them, susceptible, to, opportunistic, depredation, by, freshwater, crocodiles, megabats, are, the, hosts, of, several, parasite, taxa, known, parasites, include, nycteribiidae, and, streblidae, species, bat, flies, as, well, as, mites, of, the, genus, demodex, blood, parasites, of, the, family, haemoproteidae, and, intestinal, nematodes, of, toxocaridae, also, affect, megabat, species, megabats, are, widely, distributed, in, the, tropics, of, the, old, world, occurring, throughout, africa, asia, australia, and, throughout, the, islands, of, the, indian, ocean, and, oceania, as, of, 2013, fourteen, genera, of, megabat, are, present, in, africa, representing, twenty, eight, species, of, those, twenty, eight, species, twenty, four, are, only, found, in, tropical, or, subtropical, climates, the, remaining, four, species, are, mostly, found, in, the, tropics, but, their, ranges, also, encompass, temperate, climates, in, respect, to, habitat, types, eight, are, exclusively, or, mostly, found, in, forested, habitat, nine, are, found, in, both, forests, and, savannas, nine, are, found, exclusively, or, mostly, in, savannas, and, two, are, found, on, islands, only, one, african, species, the, long, haired, rousette, rousettus, lanosus, is, found, mostly, in, montane, ecosystems, but, an, additional, thirteen, species, ranges, extend, into, montane, habitat, 226, outside, of, southeast, asia, megabats, have, relatively, low, species, richness, in, asia, the, egyptian, fruit, bat, is, the, only, megabat, whose, range, is, mostly, in, the, palearctic, realm, it, and, the, straw, colored, fruit, bat, are, the, only, species, found, in, the, middle, east, the, northernmost, extent, of, the, egyptian, fruit, bat, s, range, is, the, northeastern, mediterranean, in, east, asia, megabats, are, found, only, in, china, and, japan, in, china, only, six, species, of, megabat, are, considered, resident, while, another, seven, are, present, marginally, at, the, edge, of, their, ranges, questionably, due, to, possible, misidentification, or, as, accidental, migrants, four, megabat, species, all, pteropus, are, found, on, japan,

neurodegenerative, diseases, bmaa, may, become, particularly, biomagnified, in, humans, who, consume, flying, foxes, flying, foxes, are, exposed, to, bmaa, by, eating, cycad, fruits, megabats, are, the, reservoirs, of, several, viruses, that, can, affect, humans, and, cause, disease, they, can, carry, filoviruses, including, the, ebola, virus, ebov, and, marburgvirus, the, presence, of, marburgvirus, which, causes, marburg, virus, disease, has, been, confirmed, in, one, species, the, egyptian, fruit, bat, the, disease, is, rare, but, the, fatality, rate, of, an, outbreak, can, reach, up, to, 88, the, virus, was, first, recognized, after, simultaneous, outbreaks, in, the, german, cities, of, marburg, and, frankfurt, as, well, as, belgrade, serbia, in, 1967, where, 31, people, became, ill, and, seven, died, the, outbreak, was, traced, to, laboratory, work, with, vervet, monkeys, from, uganda, the, virus, can, pass, from, a, bat, host, to, a, human, who, has, usually, spent, a, prolonged, period, in, a, mine, or, cave, where, egyptian, fruit, bats, live, from, there, it, can, spread, person, to, person, through, contact, with, infected, bodily, fluids, including, blood, and, semen, the, united, states, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, lists, a, total, of, 601, confirmed, cases, of, marburg, virus, disease, from, 1967, to, 2014, of, which, 373, people, died, 62, overall, mortality, species, that, have, tested, positive, for, the, presence, of, ebov, include, franquet, s, epauletted, fruit, bat, epomops, franqueti, the, hammer, headed, fruit, bat, and, the, little, collared, fruit, bat, additionally, antibodies, against, ebov, have, been, found, in, the, straw, colored, fruit, bat, gambian, epauletted, fruit, bat, epomophorus, gambianus, peters, s, dwarf, epauletted, fruit, bat, micropteropus, pusillus, veldkamp, s, dwarf, epauletted, fruit, bat, nanonycteris, veldkampii, leschenault, s, rousette, and, the, egyptian, fruit, bat, much, of, how, humans, contract, the, ebola, virus, is, unknown, scientists, hypothesize, that, humans, initially, become, infected, through, contact, with, an, infected, animal, such, as, a, megabat, or, non, human, primate, megabats, are, presumed, to, be, a, natural, reservoir, of, the, ebola, virus, but, this, has, not, been, firmly, established, microbats, are, also, being, investigated, as, the, reservoir, of, the, virus, with, the, greater, long, fingered, bat, miniopterus, inflatus, once, found, to, harbor, a, fifth, of, the, virus, s, genome, though, not, testing, positive, for, the, actual, virus, in, 2019, due, to, the, likely, association, between, ebola, infection, and, hunting, butchering, and, processing, meat, from, infected, animals, several, west, african, countries, banned, bushmeat, including, megabats, or, issued, warnings, about, it, during, the, 2013, 2016, epidemic, many, bans, have, since, been, lifted, other, megabats, implicated, as, disease, reservoirs, are, primarily, pteropus, species, notably, flying, foxes, can, transmit, australian, bat, lyssavirus, which, along, with, the, rabies, virus, causes, rabies, australian, bat, lyssavirus, was, first, identified, in, 1996, it, is, very, rarely, transmitted, to, humans, transmission, occurs, from, the, bite, or, scratch, of, an, infected, animal, but, can, also, occur, from, getting, the, infected, animal, s, saliva, in, a, mucous, membrane, or, an, open, wound, exposure, to, flying, fox, blood, urine, or, feces, cannot, cause, infections, of, australian, bat, lyssavirus, since, 1994, there, have, been, three, records, of, people, becoming, infected, with, it, in, queensland, each, case, was, fatal, flying, foxes, are, also, reservoirs, of, henipaviruses, such, as, hendra, virus, and, nipah, virus, hendra, virus, was, first, identified, in, 1994, it, rarely, occurs, in, humans, from, 1994, to, 2013, there, have, been, seven, reported, cases, of, hendra, virus, affecting, people, four, of, which, were, fatal, the, hypothesized, primary, route, of, human, infection, is, via, contact, with, horses, that, have, come, into, contact, with, flying, fox, urine, there, are, no, documented, instances, of, direct, transmission, between, flying, foxes, and, humans, as, of, 2012, there, is, a, vaccine, available, for, horses, to, decrease, the, likelihood, of, infection, and, transmission, nipah, virus, was, first, identified, in, 1998, in, malaysia, since, 1998, there, have, been, several, nipah, outbreaks, in, malaysia, singapore, india, and, bangladesh, resulting, in, over, 100, casualties, a, 2018, outbreak, in, kerala, india, resulted, in, 19, humans, becoming, infected, 17, died, the, overall, fatality, rate, is, 40, 75, humans, can, contract, nipah, virus, from, direct, contact, with, flying, foxes, or, their, fluids, through, exposure, to, an, intermediate, host, such, as, domestic, pigs, or, from, contact, with, an, infected, person, a, 2014, study, of, the, indian, flying, fox, and, nipah, virus, found, that, while, nipah, virus, outbreaks, are, more, likely, in, areas, preferred, by, flying, foxes, the, presence, of, bats, in, and, of, itself, is, not, considered, a, risk, factor, for, nipah, virus, infection, rather, the, consumption, of, date, palm, sap, is, a, significant, route, of, transmission, the, practice, of, date, palm, sap, collection, involves, placing, collecting, pots, at, date, palm, trees, indian, flying, foxes, have, been, observed, licking, the, sap, as, it, flows, into, the, pots, as, well, as, defecating, and, urinating, in, proximity, to, the, pots, in, this, way, humans, who, drink, palm, wine, can, be, exposed, to, henipaviruses, the, use, of, bamboo, skirts, on, collecting, pots, lowers, the, risk, of, contamination, from, bat, urine, flying, foxes, can, transmit, several, non, lethal, diseases, as, well, such, as, menangle, virus, and, nelson, bay, virus, these, viruses, rarely, affect, humans, and, few, cases, have, been, reported, megabats, are, not, suspected, to, be, vectors, of, coronaviruses, megabats, particularly, flying, foxes, are, featured, in, indigenous, cultures, and, traditions, folk, stories, from, australia, and, papua, new, guinea, feature, them, they, were, also, included, in, indigenous, australian, cave, art, as, evinced, by, several, surviving, examples, indigenous, societies, in, oceania, used, parts, of, flying, foxes, for, functional, and, ceremonial, weapons, in, the, solomon, islands, people, created, barbs, out, of, their, bones, for, use, in, spears, in, new, caledonia, ceremonial, axes, made, of, jade, were, decorated, with, braids, of, flying, fox, fur, flying, fox, wings, were, depicted, on, the, war, shields, of, the, asmat, people, of, indonesia, they, believed, that, the, wings, offered, protection, to, their, warriors, there, are, modern, and, historical, references, to, flying, fox, byproducts, used, as, currency, in, new, caledonia, braided, flying, fox, fur, was, once, used, as, currency, on, the, island, of, makira, which, is, part, of, the, solomon, islands, indigenous, peoples, still, hunt, flying, foxes, for, their, teeth, as, well, as, for, bushmeat, the, canine, teeth, are, strung, together, on, necklaces, that, are, used, as, currency, teeth, of, the, insular, flying, fox, pteropus, tonganus, are, particularly, prized, as, they, are, usually, large, enough, to, drill, holes, in, the, makira, flying, fox, pteropus, cognatus, is, also, hunted, despite, its, smaller, teeth, deterring, people, from, using, flying, fox, teeth, as, currency, may, be, detrimental, to, the, species, with, lavery, and, fasi, noting, species, that, provide, an, important, cultural, resource, can, be, highly, treasured, emphasizing, sustainable, hunting, of, flying, foxes, to, preserve, cultural, currency, may, be, more, effective, than, encouraging, the, abandonment, of, cultural, currency, even, if, flying, foxes, were, no, longer, hunted, for, their, teeth, they, would, still, be, killed, for, bushmeat, therefore, retaining, their, cultural, value, may, encourage, sustainable, hunting, practices, lavery, stated, it, s, a, positive, not, a, negative, that, their, teeth, are, so, culturally, valuable, the, practice, of, hunting, bats, shouldn, t, necessarily, be, stopped, it, needs, to, be, managed, sustainably, as, of, 2014, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, evaluated, a, quarter, of, all, megabat, species, as, threatened, which, includes, species, listed, as, critically, endangered, endangered, and, vulnerable, megabats, are, substantially, threatened, by, humans, as, they, are, hunted, for, food, and, medicinal, uses, additionally, they, are, culled, for, actual, or, perceived, damage, to, agriculture, especially, to, fruit, production, as, of, 2019, the, iucn, had, evaluations, for, 187, megabat, species, the, status, breakdown, is, as, follows, megabats, are, threatened, by, habitat, destruction, by, humans, deforestation, of, their, habitats, has, resulted, in, the, loss, of, critical, roosting, habitat, deforestation, also, results, in, the, loss, of, food, resource, as, native, fruit, bearing, trees, are, felled, habitat, loss, and, resulting, urbanization, leads, to, construction, of, new, roadways, making, megabat, colonies, easier, to, access, for, overharvesting, additionally, habitat, loss, via, deforestation, compounds, natural, threats, as, fragmented, forests, are, more, susceptible, to, damage, from, typhoon, force, winds, 7, cave, roosting, megabats, are, threatened, by, human, disturbance, at, their, roost, sites, guano, mining, is, a, livelihood, in, some, countries, within, their, range, bringing, people, to, caves, caves, are, also, disturbed, by, mineral, mining, and, cave, tourism, 8, megabats, are, also, killed, by, humans, intentionally, and, unintentionally, half, of, all, megabat, species, are, hunted, for, food, in, comparison, to, only, eight, percent, of, insectivorous, species, while, human, persecution, stemming, from, perceived, damage, to, crops, is, also, a, large, source, of, mortality, some, megabats, have, been, documented, to, have, a, preference, for, native, fruit, trees, over, fruit, crops, but, deforestation, can, reduce, their, food, supply, causing, them, to, rely, on, fruit, crops, 8, they, are, shot, beaten, to, death, or, poisoned, to, reduce, their, populations, mortality, also, occurs, via, accidental, entanglement, in, netting, used, to, prevent, the, bats, from, eating, fruit, culling, campaigns, can, dramatically, reduce, megabat, populations, in, mauritius, over, 40, 000, mauritian, flying, foxes, were, culled, between, 2014, and, 2016, reducing, the, species, population, by, an, estimated, 45, megabats, are, also, killed, by, electrocution, in, one, australian, orchard, it, is, estimated, that, over, 21, 000, bats, were, electrocuted, to, death, in, an, eight, week, period, farmers, construct, electrified, grids, over, their, fruit, trees, to, kill, megabats, before, they, can, consume, their, crop, the, grids, are, questionably, effective, at, preventing, crop, loss, with, one, farmer, who, operated, such, a, grid, estimating, they, still, lost, 100, 120, tonnes, 220, 000, 260, 000, lb, of, fruit, to, flying, foxes, in, a, year, some, electrocution, deaths, are, also, accidental, such, as, when, bats, fly, into, overhead, power, lines, climate, change, causes, flying, fox, mortality, and, is, a, source, of, concern, for, species, persistence, extreme, heat, waves, in, australia, have, been, responsible, for, the, deaths, of, more, than, 30, 000, flying, foxes, from, 1994, to, 2008, females, and, young, bats, are, most, susceptible, to, extreme, heat, which, affects, a, population, s, ability, to, recover, megabats, are, threatened, by, sea, level, rise, associated, with, climate, change, as, several, species, are, endemic, to, low, lying, atolls, because, many, species, are, endemic, to, a, single, island, they, are, vulnerable, to, random, events, such, as, typhoons, a, 1979, typhoon, halved, the, remaining, population, of, the, rodrigues, flying, fox, pteropus, rodricensis, typhoons, result, in, indirect, mortality, as, well, because, typhoons, defoliate, the, trees, they, make, megabats, more, visible, and, thus, more, easily, hunted, by, humans, food, resources, for, the, bats, become, scarce, after, major, storms, and, megabats, resort, to, riskier, foraging, strategies, such, as, consuming, fallen, fruit, off, the, ground, there, they, are, more, vulnerable, to, depredation, by, domestic, cats, dogs, and, pigs, as, many, megabat, species, are, located, in, the, tectonically, active, ring, of, fire, they, are, also, threatened, by, volcanic, eruptions, flying, foxes, including, the, endangered, mariana, fruit, bat, have, been, nearly, exterminated, from, the, island, of, anatahan, following, a, series, of, eruptions, beginning, in, 2003
