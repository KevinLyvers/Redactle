botulism, is, a, rare, and, potentially, fatal, illness, caused, by, botulinum, toxin, which, is, produced, by, the, bacterium, clostridium, botulinum, the, disease, begins, with, weakness, blurred, vision, feeling, tired, and, trouble, speaking, this, may, then, be, followed, by, weakness, of, the, arms, chest, muscles, and, legs, vomiting, swelling, of, the, abdomen, and, diarrhea, may, also, occur, the, disease, does, not, usually, affect, consciousness, or, cause, a, fever, botulism, can, occur, in, several, ways, the, bacterial, spores, which, cause, it, are, common, in, both, soil, and, water, and, are, very, resistant, they, produce, the, botulinum, toxin, when, exposed, to, low, oxygen, levels, and, certain, temperatures, foodborne, botulism, happens, when, food, containing, the, toxin, is, eaten, infant, botulism, instead, happens, when, the, bacterium, develops, in, the, intestines, and, releases, the, toxin, this, typically, only, occurs, in, children, less, than, one, year, old, as, protective, mechanisms, against, development, of, the, bacterium, develop, after, that, age, wound, botulism, is, found, most, often, among, those, who, inject, street, drugs, in, this, situation, spores, enter, a, wound, and, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, release, the, toxin, the, disease, is, not, passed, directly, between, people, its, diagnosis, is, confirmed, by, finding, the, toxin, or, bacteria, in, the, person, in, question, prevention, is, primarily, by, proper, food, preparation, the, toxin, though, not, the, spores, is, destroyed, by, heating, it, to, more, than, 85, c, 185, f, for, longer, than, five, minutes, the, clostridial, spores, can, be, destroyed, in, the, autoclave, with, moist, heat, 120, c, 250, f, for, at, least, 15, minutes, or, dry, heat, 160, c, for, 2, hours, or, by, irradiation, the, spores, of, group, i, strains, are, inactivated, by, heating, at, 121, c, 250, f, for, 3, minutes, during, commercial, canning, spores, of, group, ii, strains, are, less, heat, resistant, and, they, are, often, damaged, by, 90, c, 194, f, for, 10, minutes, 85, c, for, 52, minutes, or, 80, c, for, 270, minutes, however, these, treatments, may, not, be, sufficient, in, some, foods, honey, can, contain, the, organism, and, for, this, reason, honey, should, not, be, fed, to, children, under, 12, months, treatment, is, with, an, antitoxin, in, those, who, lose, their, ability, to, breathe, on, their, own, mechanical, ventilation, may, be, necessary, for, months, antibiotics, may, be, used, for, wound, botulism, death, occurs, in, 5, to, 10, of, people, botulism, also, affects, many, other, animals, the, word, is, from, latin, botulus, meaning, sausage, the, muscle, weakness, of, botulism, characteristically, starts, in, the, muscles, supplied, by, the, cranial, nerves, a, group, of, twelve, nerves, that, control, eye, movements, the, facial, muscles, and, the, muscles, controlling, chewing, and, swallowing, double, vision, drooping, of, both, eyelids, loss, of, facial, expression, and, swallowing, problems, may, therefore, occur, in, addition, to, affecting, the, voluntary, muscles, it, can, also, cause, disruptions, in, the, autonomic, nervous, system, this, is, experienced, as, a, dry, mouth, and, throat, due, to, decreased, production, of, saliva, postural, hypotension, decreased, blood, pressure, on, standing, with, resultant, lightheadedness, and, risk, of, blackouts, and, eventually, constipation, due, to, decreased, forward, movement, of, intestinal, contents, some, of, the, toxins, b, and, e, also, precipitate, nausea, vomiting, and, difficulty, with, talking, the, weakness, then, spreads, to, the, arms, starting, in, the, shoulders, and, proceeding, to, the, forearms, and, legs, again, from, the, thighs, down, to, the, feet, severe, botulism, leads, to, reduced, movement, of, the, muscles, of, respiration, and, hence, problems, with, gas, exchange, this, may, be, experienced, as, dyspnea, difficulty, breathing, but, when, severe, can, lead, to, respiratory, failure, due, to, the, buildup, of, unexhaled, carbon, dioxide, and, its, resultant, depressant, effect, on, the, brain, this, may, lead, to, respiratory, compromise, and, death, if, untreated, clinicians, frequently, think, of, the, symptoms, of, botulism, in, terms, of, a, classic, triad, bulbar, palsy, and, descending, paralysis, lack, of, fever, and, clear, senses, and, mental, status, clear, sensorium, infant, botulism, also, referred, to, as, floppy, baby, syndrome, was, first, recognized, in, 1976, and, is, the, most, common, form, of, botulism, in, the, united, states, infants, are, susceptible, to, infant, botulism, in, the, first, year, of, life, with, more, than, 90, of, cases, occurring, in, infants, younger, than, six, months, infant, botulism, results, from, the, ingestion, of, the, c, botulinum, spores, and, subsequent, colonization, of, the, small, intestine, the, infant, gut, may, be, colonized, when, the, composition, of, the, intestinal, microflora, normal, flora, is, insufficient, to, competitively, inhibit, the, growth, of, c, botulinum, and, levels, of, bile, acids, which, normally, inhibit, clostridial, growth, are, lower, than, later, in, life, the, growth, of, the, spores, releases, botulinum, toxin, which, is, then, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, and, taken, throughout, the, body, causing, paralysis, by, blocking, the, release, of, acetylcholine, at, the, neuromuscular, junction, typical, symptoms, of, infant, botulism, include, constipation, lethargy, weakness, difficulty, feeding, and, an, altered, cry, often, progressing, to, a, complete, descending, flaccid, paralysis, although, constipation, is, usually, the, first, symptom, of, infant, botulism, it, is, commonly, overlooked, honey, is, a, known, dietary, reservoir, of, c, botulinum, spores, and, has, been, linked, to, infant, botulism, for, this, reason, honey, is, not, recommended, for, infants, less, than, one, year, of, age, most, cases, of, infant, botulism, however, are, thought, to, be, caused, by, acquiring, the, spores, from, the, natural, environment, clostridium, botulinum, is, a, ubiquitous, soil, dwelling, bacterium, many, infant, botulism, patients, have, been, demonstrated, to, live, near, a, construction, site, or, an, area, of, soil, disturbance, infant, botulism, has, been, reported, in, 49, of, 50, us, states, all, save, for, rhode, island, and, cases, have, been, recognized, in, 26, countries, on, five, continents, infant, botulism, has, no, long, term, side, effects, botulism, can, result, in, death, due, to, respiratory, failure, however, in, the, past, 50, years, the, proportion, of, patients, with, botulism, who, die, has, fallen, from, about, 50, to, 7, due, to, improved, supportive, care, a, patient, with, severe, botulism, may, require, mechanical, ventilation, breathing, support, through, a, ventilator, as, well, as, intensive, medical, and, nursing, care, sometimes, for, several, months, the, person, may, require, rehabilitation, therapy, after, leaving, the, hospital, clostridium, botulinum, is, an, anaerobic, gram, positive, spore, forming, rod, botulinum, toxin, is, one, of, the, most, powerful, known, toxins, about, one, microgram, is, lethal, to, humans, when, inhaled, it, acts, by, blocking, nerve, function, neuromuscular, blockade, through, inhibition, of, the, excitatory, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, s, release, from, the, presynaptic, membrane, of, neuromuscular, junctions, in, the, somatic, nervous, system, this, causes, paralysis, advanced, botulism, can, cause, respiratory, failure, by, paralysing, the, muscles, of, the, chest, this, can, progress, to, respiratory, arrest, furthermore, acetylcholine, release, from, the, presynaptic, membranes, of, muscarinic, nerve, synapses, is, blocked, this, can, lead, to, a, variety, of, autonomic, signs, and, symptoms, described, above, in, all, cases, illness, is, caused, by, the, botulinum, toxin, which, the, bacterium, c, botulinum, produces, in, anaerobic, conditions, and, not, by, the, bacterium, itself, the, pattern, of, damage, occurs, because, the, toxin, affects, nerves, that, fire, depolarize, at, a, higher, frequency, first, mechanisms, of, entry, into, the, human, body, for, botulinum, toxin, are, described, below, the, most, common, form, in, western, countries, is, infant, botulism, this, occurs, in, infants, who, are, colonized, with, the, bacterium, in, the, small, intestine, during, the, early, stages, of, their, lives, the, bacterium, then, produces, the, toxin, which, is, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, the, consumption, of, honey, during, the, first, year, of, life, has, been, identified, as, a, risk, factor, for, infant, botulism, it, is, a, factor, in, a, fifth, of, all, cases, the, adult, form, of, infant, botulism, is, termed, adult, intestinal, toxemia, and, is, exceedingly, rare, toxin, that, is, produced, by, the, bacterium, in, containers, of, food, that, have, been, improperly, preserved, is, the, most, common, cause, of, food, borne, botulism, fish, that, has, been, pickled, without, the, salinity, or, acidity, of, brine, that, contains, acetic, acid, and, high, sodium, levels, as, well, as, smoked, fish, stored, at, too, high, a, temperature, presents, a, risk, as, does, improperly, canned, food, food, borne, botulism, results, from, contaminated, food, in, which, c, botulinum, spores, have, been, allowed, to, germinate, in, low, oxygen, conditions, this, typically, occurs, in, improperly, prepared, home, canned, food, substances, and, fermented, dishes, without, adequate, salt, or, acidity, given, that, multiple, people, often, consume, food, from, the, same, source, it, is, common, for, more, than, a, single, person, to, be, affected, simultaneously, symptoms, usually, appear, 12, 36, hours, after, eating, but, can, also, appear, within, 6, hours, to, 10, days, no, withdrawal, periods, have, been, established, for, cows, affected, by, botulism, lactating, cows, injected, with, various, doses, of, botulinum, toxin, c, have, not, resulted, in, detectable, botulinum, neurotoxin, in, milk, produced, using, mouse, bioassays, and, immunostick, elisa, tests, botulinum, toxin, was, detected, in, whole, blood, and, serum, but, not, in, milk, samples, suggesting, that, botulinum, type, c, toxin, does, not, enter, milk, in, detectable, concentrations, cooking, and, pasteurization, denatures, botulinum, toxin, but, does, not, necessarily, eliminate, spores, botulinum, spores, or, toxins, can, find, their, way, into, the, dairy, production, chain, from, the, environment, despite, the, low, risk, of, milk, and, meat, contamination, the, protocol, for, fatal, bovine, botulism, cases, appears, to, be, incineration, of, carcasses, and, withholding, any, potentially, contaminated, milk, from, human, consumption, it, is, also, advised, that, raw, milk, from, affected, cows, should, not, be, consumed, by, humans, or, fed, to, calves, wound, botulism, results, from, the, contamination, of, a, wound, with, the, bacteria, which, then, secrete, the, toxin, into, the, bloodstream, this, has, become, more, common, in, intravenous, drug, users, since, the, 1990s, especially, people, using, black, tar, heroin, and, those, injecting, heroin, into, the, skin, rather, than, the, veins, wound, botulism, accounts, for, 29, of, cases, isolated, cases, of, botulism, have, been, described, after, inhalation, by, laboratory, workers, symptoms, of, botulism, may, occur, away, from, the, injection, site, of, botulinum, toxin, this, may, include, loss, of, strength, blurred, vision, change, of, voice, or, trouble, breathing, which, can, result, in, death, onset, can, be, hours, to, weeks, after, an, injection, this, generally, only, occurs, with, inappropriate, strengths, of, botulinum, toxin, for, cosmetic, use, or, due, to, the, larger, doses, used, to, treat, movement, disorders, following, a, 2008, review, the, fda, added, these, concerns, as, a, boxed, warning, the, toxin, is, the, protein, botulinum, toxin, produced, under, anaerobic, conditions, where, there, is, no, oxygen, by, the, bacterium, clostridium, botulinum, clostridium, botulinum, is, a, large, anaerobic, gram, positive, bacillus, that, forms, subterminal, endospores, there, are, eight, serological, varieties, of, the, bacterium, denoted, by, the, letters, a, to, h, the, toxin, from, all, of, these, acts, in, the, same, way, and, produces, similar, symptoms, the, motor, nerve, endings, are, prevented, from, releasing, acetylcholine, causing, flaccid, paralysis, and, symptoms, of, blurred, vision, ptosis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or, constipation, cramps, and, respiratory, difficulty, botulinum, toxin, is, broken, into, eight, neurotoxins, labeled, as, types, a, b, c, d, e, f, and, g, which, are, antigenically, and, serologically, distinct, but, structurally, similar, human, botulism, is, caused, mainly, by, types, a, b, e, and, rarely, f, types, c, and, d, cause, toxicity, only, in, other, animals, in, october, 2013, scientists, released, news, of, the, discovery, of, type, h, the, first, new, botulism, neurotoxin, found, in, forty, years, however, further, studies, showed, type, h, to, be, a, chimeric, toxin, composed, of, parts, of, types, f, and, a, fa, some, types, produce, a, characteristic, putrefactive, smell, and, digest, meat, types, a, and, some, of, b, and, f, these, are, said, to, be, proteolytic, type, e, and, some, types, of, b, c, d, and, f, are, nonproteolytic, and, can, go, undetected, because, there, is, no, strong, odor, associated, with, them, when, the, bacteria, are, under, stress, they, develop, spores, which, are, inert, their, natural, habitats, are, in, the, soil, in, the, silt, that, comprises, the, bottom, sediment, of, streams, lakes, and, coastal, waters, and, ocean, while, some, types, are, natural, inhabitants, of, the, intestinal, tracts, of, mammals, e, g, horses, cattle, humans, and, are, present, in, their, excreta, the, spores, can, survive, in, their, inert, form, for, many, years, toxin, is, produced, by, the, bacteria, when, environmental, conditions, are, favourable, for, the, spores, to, replicate, and, grow, but, the, gene, that, encodes, for, the, toxin, protein, is, actually, carried, by, a, virus, or, phage, that, infects, the, bacteria, little, is, known, about, the, natural, factors, that, control, phage, infection, and, replication, within, the, bacteria, the, spores, require, warm, temperatures, a, protein, source, an, anaerobic, environment, and, moisture, in, order, to, become, active, and, produce, toxin, in, the, wild, decomposing, vegetation, and, invertebrates, combined, with, warm, temperatures, can, provide, ideal, conditions, for, the, botulism, bacteria, to, activate, and, produce, toxin, that, may, affect, feeding, birds, and, other, animals, spores, are, not, killed, by, boiling, but, botulism, is, uncommon, because, special, rarely, obtained, conditions, are, necessary, for, botulinum, toxin, production, from, c, botulinum, spores, including, an, anaerobic, low, salt, low, acid, low, sugar, environment, at, ambient, temperatures, botulinum, inhibits, the, release, within, the, nervous, system, of, acetylcholine, a, neurotransmitter, responsible, for, communication, between, motor, neurons, and, muscle, cells, all, forms, of, botulism, lead, to, paralysis, that, typically, starts, with, the, muscles, of, the, face, and, then, spreads, towards, the, limbs, in, severe, forms, botulism, leads, to, paralysis, of, the, breathing, muscles, and, causes, respiratory, failure, in, light, of, this, life, threatening, complication, all, suspected, cases, of, botulism, are, treated, as, medical, emergencies, and, public, health, officials, are, usually, involved, to, identify, the, source, and, take, steps, to, prevent, further, cases, from, occurring, botulinum, toxin, a, c, and, e, cleave, the, snap, 25, ultimately, leading, to, paralysis, for, botulism, in, babies, diagnosis, should, be, made, on, signs, and, symptoms, confirmation, of, the, diagnosis, is, made, by, testing, of, a, stool, or, enema, specimen, with, the, mouse, bioassay, in, people, whose, history, and, physical, examination, suggest, botulism, these, clues, are, often, not, enough, to, allow, a, diagnosis, other, diseases, such, as, guillain, barr, syndrome, stroke, and, myasthenia, gravis, can, appear, similar, to, botulism, and, special, tests, may, be, needed, to, exclude, these, other, conditions, these, tests, may, include, a, brain, scan, cerebrospinal, fluid, examination, nerve, conduction, test, electromyography, or, emg, and, an, edrophonium, chloride, tensilon, test, for, myasthenia, gravis, a, definite, diagnosis, can, be, made, if, botulinum, toxin, is, identified, in, the, food, stomach, or, intestinal, contents, vomit, or, feces, the, toxin, is, occasionally, found, in, the, blood, in, peracute, cases, botulinum, toxin, can, be, detected, by, a, variety, of, techniques, including, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assays, elisas, electrochemiluminescent, ecl, tests, and, mouse, inoculation, or, feeding, trials, the, toxins, can, be, typed, with, neutralization, tests, in, mice, in, toxicoinfectious, botulism, the, organism, can, be, cultured, from, tissues, on, egg, yolk, medium, toxin, producing, colonies, usually, display, surface, iridescence, that, extends, beyond, the, colony, although, the, vegetative, form, of, the, bacteria, is, destroyed, by, boiling, the, spore, itself, is, not, killed, by, the, temperatures, reached, with, normal, sea, level, pressure, boiling, leaving, it, free, to, grow, and, again, produce, the, toxin, when, conditions, are, right, a, recommended, prevention, measure, for, infant, botulism, is, to, avoid, giving, honey, to, infants, less, than, 12, months, of, age, as, botulinum, spores, are, often, present, in, older, children, and, adults, the, normal, intestinal, bacteria, suppress, development, of, c, botulinum, while, commercially, canned, goods, are, required, to, undergo, a, botulinum, cook, in, a, pressure, cooker, at, 121, c, 250, f, for, 3, minutes, and, thus, rarely, cause, botulism, there, have, been, notable, exceptions, two, were, the, 1978, alaskan, salmon, outbreak, and, the, 2007, castleberry, s, food, company, outbreak, foodborne, botulism, is, the, rarest, form, accounting, for, only, around, 15, of, cases, us, and, has, more, frequently, resulted, from, home, canned, foods, with, low, acid, content, such, as, carrot, juice, asparagus, green, beans, beets, and, corn, however, outbreaks, of, botulism, have, resulted, from, more, unusual, sources, in, july, 2002, fourteen, alaskans, ate, muktuk, whale, meat, from, a, beached, whale, and, eight, of, them, developed, symptoms, of, botulism, two, of, them, requiring, mechanical, ventilation, other, much, rarer, sources, of, infection, about, every, decade, in, the, us, include, garlic, or, herbs, stored, covered, in, oil, without, acidification, chili, peppers, improperly, handled, baked, potatoes, wrapped, in, aluminum, foil, tomatoes, and, home, canned, or, fermented, fish, when, canning, or, preserving, food, at, home, attention, should, be, paid, to, hygiene, pressure, temperature, refrigeration, and, storage, when, making, home, preserves, only, acidic, fruit, such, as, apples, pears, stone, fruits, and, berries, should, be, used, tropical, fruit, and, tomatoes, are, low, in, acidity, and, must, have, some, acidity, added, before, they, are, canned, low, acid, foods, have, ph, values, higher, than, 4, 6, they, include, red, meats, seafood, poultry, milk, and, all, fresh, vegetables, except, for, most, tomatoes, most, mixtures, of, low, acid, and, acid, foods, also, have, ph, values, above, 4, 6, unless, their, recipes, include, enough, lemon, juice, citric, acid, or, vinegar, to, make, them, acidic, acid, foods, have, a, ph, of, 4, 6, or, lower, they, include, fruits, pickles, sauerkraut, jams, jellies, marmalades, and, fruit, butters, although, tomatoes, usually, are, considered, an, acid, food, some, are, now, known, to, have, ph, values, slightly, above, 4, 6, figs, also, have, ph, values, slightly, above, 4, 6, therefore, if, they, are, to, be, canned, as, acid, foods, these, products, must, be, acidified, to, a, ph, of, 4, 6, or, lower, with, lemon, juice, or, citric, acid, properly, acidified, tomatoes, and, figs, are, acid, foods, and, can, be, safely, processed, in, a, boiling, water, canner, oils, infused, with, fresh, garlic, or, herbs, should, be, acidified, and, refrigerated, potatoes, which, have, been, baked, while, wrapped, in, aluminum, foil, should, be, kept, hot, until, served, or, refrigerated, because, the, botulism, toxin, is, destroyed, by, high, temperatures, home, canned, foods, are, best, boiled, for, 10, minutes, before, eating, metal, cans, containing, food, in, which, bacteria, are, growing, may, bulge, outwards, due, to, gas, production, from, bacterial, growth, or, the, food, inside, may, be, foamy, or, have, a, bad, odor, cans, with, any, of, these, signs, should, be, discarded, any, container, of, food, which, has, been, heat, treated, and, then, assumed, to, be, airtight, which, shows, signs, of, not, being, so, e, g, metal, cans, with, pinprick, holes, from, rust, or, mechanical, damage, should, be, discarded, contamination, of, a, canned, food, solely, with, c, botulinum, may, not, cause, any, visual, defects, to, the, container, such, as, bulging, only, assurance, of, sufficient, thermal, processing, during, production, and, absence, of, a, route, for, subsequent, contamination, should, be, used, as, indicators, of, food, safety, the, addition, of, nitrites, and, nitrates, to, processed, meats, such, as, ham, bacon, and, sausages, reduces, growth, and, toxin, production, of, c, botulinum, vaccines, are, under, development, but, they, have, disadvantages, as, of, 2017, work, to, develop, a, better, vaccine, was, being, carried, out, but, the, us, fda, had, not, approved, any, vaccine, against, botulism, botulism, is, generally, treated, with, botulism, antitoxin, and, supportive, care, supportive, care, for, botulism, includes, monitoring, of, respiratory, function, respiratory, failure, due, to, paralysis, may, require, mechanical, ventilation, for, 2, to, 8, weeks, plus, intensive, medical, and, nursing, care, after, this, time, paralysis, generally, improves, as, new, neuromuscular, connections, are, formed, in, some, abdominal, cases, physicians, may, try, to, remove, contaminated, food, still, in, the, digestive, tract, by, inducing, vomiting, or, using, enemas, wounds, should, be, treated, usually, surgically, to, remove, the, source, of, the, toxin, producing, bacteria, botulinum, antitoxin, consists, of, antibodies, that, neutralize, botulinum, toxin, in, the, circulatory, system, by, passive, immunization, this, prevents, additional, toxin, from, binding, to, the, neuromuscular, junction, but, does, not, reverse, any, already, inflicted, paralysis, in, adults, a, trivalent, antitoxin, containing, antibodies, raised, against, botulinum, toxin, types, a, b, and, e, is, used, most, commonly, however, a, heptavalent, botulism, antitoxin, has, also, been, developed, and, was, approved, by, the, u, s, fda, in, 2013, in, infants, horse, derived, antitoxin, is, sometimes, avoided, for, fear, of, infants, developing, serum, sickness, or, lasting, hypersensitivity, to, horse, derived, proteins, to, avoid, this, a, human, derived, antitoxin, has, been, developed, and, approved, by, the, u, s, fda, in, 2003, for, the, treatment, of, infant, botulism, this, human, derived, antitoxin, has, been, shown, to, be, both, safe, and, effective, for, the, treatment, of, infant, botulism, however, the, danger, of, equine, derived, antitoxin, to, infants, has, not, been, clearly, established, and, one, study, showed, the, equine, derived, antitoxin, to, be, both, safe, and, effective, for, the, treatment, of, infant, botulism, trivalent, a, b, e, botulinum, antitoxin, is, derived, from, equine, sources, utilizing, whole, antibodies, fab, and, fc, portions, in, the, united, states, this, antitoxin, is, available, from, the, local, health, department, via, the, cdc, the, second, antitoxin, heptavalent, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, botulinum, antitoxin, is, derived, from, despeciated, equine, igg, antibodies, which, have, had, the, fc, portion, cleaved, off, leaving, the, f, ab, 2, portions, this, less, immunogenic, antitoxin, is, effective, against, all, known, strains, of, botulism, where, not, contraindicated, the, paralysis, caused, by, botulism, can, persist, for, two, to, eight, weeks, during, which, supportive, care, and, ventilation, may, be, necessary, to, keep, the, patient, alive, botulism, can, be, fatal, in, five, to, ten, percent, of, people, who, are, affected, however, if, left, untreated, botulism, is, fatal, in, 40, to, 50, percent, of, cases, infant, botulism, typically, has, no, long, term, side, effects, but, can, be, complicated, by, treatment, associated, adverse, events, the, case, fatality, rate, is, less, than, two, percent, for, hospitalized, babies, globally, botulism, is, fairly, rare, with, approximately, 1, 000, identified, cases, yearly, in, the, united, states, an, average, of, 145, cases, are, reported, each, year, of, these, roughly, 65, are, infant, botulism, 20, are, wound, botulism, and, 15, are, foodborne, infant, botulism, is, predominantly, sporadic, and, not, associated, with, epidemics, but, great, geographic, variability, exists, from, 1974, to, 1996, for, example, 47, of, all, infant, botulism, cases, reported, in, the, u, s, occurred, in, california, between, 1990, and, 2000, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, reported, 263, individual, foodborne, cases, from, 160, botulism, events, in, the, united, states, with, a, case, fatality, rate, of, 4, thirty, nine, percent, 103, cases, and, 58, events, occurred, in, alaska, all, of, which, were, attributable, to, traditional, alaskan, aboriginal, foods, in, the, lower, 49, states, home, canned, food, was, implicated, in, 70, events, 69, with, canned, asparagus, being, the, most, frequent, cause, two, restaurant, associated, outbreaks, affected, 25, people, the, median, number, of, cases, per, year, was, 23, range, 17, 43, the, median, number, of, events, per, year, was, 14, range, 9, 24, the, highest, incidence, rates, occurred, in, alaska, idaho, washington, and, oregon, all, other, states, had, an, incidence, rate, of, 1, case, per, ten, million, people, or, less, the, number, of, cases, of, food, borne, and, infant, botulism, has, changed, little, in, recent, years, but, wound, botulism, has, increased, because, of, the, use, of, black, tar, heroin, especially, in, california, all, data, regarding, botulism, antitoxin, releases, and, laboratory, confirmation, of, cases, in, the, us, are, recorded, annually, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, and, published, on, their, website, the, largest, recorded, outbreak, of, foodborne, botulism, in, the, united, kingdom, occurred, in, june, 1989, a, total, of, 27, patients, were, affected, one, patient, died, twenty, five, of, the, patients, had, eaten, one, brand, of, hazelnut, yogurt, in, the, week, before, the, onset, of, symptoms, control, measures, included, the, cessation, of, all, yogurt, production, by, the, implicated, producer, the, withdrawal, of, the, firm, s, yogurts, from, sale, the, recall, of, cans, of, the, hazelnut, conserve, and, advice, to, the, general, public, to, avoid, the, consumption, of, all, hazelnut, yogurts, from, 1958, to, 1983, there, were, 986, outbreaks, of, botulism, in, china, involving, 4, 377, people, with, 548, deaths, after, the, chinese, communist, revolution, in, 1949, a, mysterious, plague, named, qapqal, disease, was, noticed, to, be, affecting, several, sibe, villages, in, qapqal, xibe, autonomous, county, it, was, endemic, with, distinctive, epidemic, patterns, yet, the, underlying, cause, remained, unknown, for, a, long, period, of, time, it, caused, a, number, of, deaths, and, forced, some, people, to, leave, the, place, in, 1958, a, team, of, experts, were, sent, to, the, area, by, the, ministry, of, health, to, investigate, the, cases, the, epidemic, survey, conducted, proved, that, the, disease, was, primarily, type, a, botulism, with, several, cases, of, type, b, the, team, also, discovered, that, the, source, of, the, botulinum, was, local, fermented, grain, and, beans, as, well, as, a, raw, meat, food, called, mi, song, hu, hu, they, promoted, the, improvement, of, fermentation, techniques, among, local, residents, and, thus, eliminated, the, disease, from, 1985, to, 2005, there, were, outbreaks, causing, 91, confirmed, cases, of, foodborne, botulism, in, canada, 85, of, which, were, in, inuit, communities, especially, nunavik, as, well, as, first, nations, of, the, coast, of, british, columbia, following, consumption, of, traditionally, prepared, marine, mammal, and, fish, products, in, 2017, there, were, 70, cases, of, botulism, with, 8, deaths, in, ukraine, the, previous, year, there, were, 115, cases, with, 12, deaths, most, cases, were, the, result, of, dried, fish, a, common, local, drinking, snack, in, 2020, several, cases, of, botulism, were, reported, in, vietnam, all, of, them, were, related, to, a, product, containing, contaminated, vegetarian, p, t, some, patients, were, put, on, life, support, botulism, can, occur, in, many, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, botulism, has, been, reported, in, such, species, as, rats, mice, chicken, frogs, toads, goldfish, aplysia, squid, crayfish, drosophila, and, leeches, death, from, botulism, is, common, in, waterfowl, an, estimated, 10, 000, to, 100, 000, birds, die, of, botulism, annually, the, disease, is, commonly, called, limberneck, in, some, large, outbreaks, a, million, or, more, birds, may, die, ducks, appear, to, be, affected, most, often, an, enzootic, form, of, duck, botulism, in, the, western, us, and, canada, is, known, as, western, duck, sickness, botulism, also, affects, commercially, raised, poultry, in, chickens, the, mortality, rate, varies, from, a, few, birds, to, 40, of, the, flock, botulism, seems, to, be, relatively, uncommon, in, domestic, mammals, however, in, some, parts, of, the, world, epidemics, with, up, to, 65, mortality, are, seen, in, cattle, the, prognosis, is, poor, in, large, animals, that, are, recumbent, in, cattle, the, symptoms, may, include, drooling, restlessness, incoordination, urine, retention, dysphagia, and, sternal, recumbency, laterally, recumbent, animals, are, usually, very, close, to, death, in, sheep, the, symptoms, may, include, drooling, a, serous, nasal, discharge, stiffness, and, incoordination, abdominal, respiration, may, be, observed, and, the, tail, may, switch, on, the, side, as, the, disease, progresses, the, limbs, may, become, paralyzed, and, death, may, occur, phosphorus, deficient, cattle, especially, in, southern, africa, are, inclined, to, ingest, bones, and, carrion, containing, clostridial, toxins, and, consequently, develop, lame, sickness, or, lamsiekte, the, clinical, signs, in, horses, are, similar, to, cattle, the, muscle, paralysis, is, progressive, it, usually, begins, at, the, hindquarters, and, gradually, moves, to, the, front, limbs, neck, and, head, death, generally, occurs, 24, to, 72, hours, after, initial, symptoms, and, results, from, respiratory, paralysis, some, foals, are, found, dead, without, other, clinical, signs, clostridium, botulinum, type, c, toxin, has, been, incriminated, as, the, cause, of, grass, sickness, a, condition, in, horses, which, occurs, in, rainy, and, hot, summers, in, northern, europe, the, main, symptom, is, pharynx, paralysis, domestic, dogs, may, develop, systemic, toxemia, after, consuming, c, botulinum, type, c, exotoxin, or, spores, within, bird, carcasses, or, other, infected, meat, but, are, generally, resistant, to, the, more, severe, effects, of, c, botulinum, type, c, symptoms, include, flaccid, muscle, paralysis, which, can, lead, to, death, due, to, cardiac, and, respiratory, arrest, pigs, are, relatively, resistant, to, botulism, reported, symptoms, include, anorexia, refusal, to, drink, vomiting, pupillary, dilation, and, muscle, paralysis, in, poultry, and, wild, birds, flaccid, paralysis, is, usually, seen, in, the, legs, wings, neck, and, eyelids, broiler, chickens, with, the, toxicoinfectious, form, may, also, have, diarrhea, with, excess, urates, one, of, the, main, routes, of, exposure, for, botulism, is, through, the, consumption, of, food, contaminated, with, c, botulinum, food, borne, botulism, can, be, prevented, in, domestic, animals, through, careful, inspection, of, the, feed, purchasing, high, quality, feed, from, reliable, sources, and, ensuring, proper, storage, poultry, litter, and, animal, carcasses, are, places, in, which, c, botulinum, spores, are, able, to, germinate, so, it, is, advised, to, avoid, spreading, poultry, litter, or, any, carcass, containing, materials, on, fields, producing, feed, materials, due, to, their, potential, for, supporting, c, botulinum, growth, additionally, water, sources, should, be, checked, for, dead, or, dying, animals, and, fields, should, be, checked, for, animal, remains, prior, to, mowing, for, hay, or, silage, correcting, any, dietary, deficiencies, can, also, prevent, animals, from, consuming, contaminated, materials, such, as, bones, or, carcasses, raw, materials, used, for, silage, or, feed, mixed, on, site, should, be, checked, for, any, sign, of, mold, or, rotten, appearance, acidification, of, animal, feed, can, reduce, but, will, not, eliminate, the, risk, of, toxin, formation, especially, in, carcasses, that, remain, whole, vaccines, have, been, developed, for, use, in, animals, to, prevent, botulism, the, availability, and, approval, of, these, vaccines, varies, depending, on, the, location, with, places, experiencing, more, cases, generally, having, more, vaccines, available, and, routine, vaccination, is, more, common, a, variety, of, vaccines, have, been, developed, for, the, prevention, of, botulism, in, livestock, most, initial, vaccinations, require, multiple, doses, at, intervals, from, 2, 6, weeks, however, some, newer, vaccines, require, only, one, shot, this, mainly, depends, on, the, type, of, vaccine, and, manufacturers, recommendations, all, vaccines, require, annual, boosters, to, maintain, immunity, many, of, these, vaccines, can, be, used, on, multiple, species, including, cattle, sheep, and, goats, with, some, labeled, for, use, in, horses, and, mules, as, well, as, separate, vaccines, for, mink, additionally, vaccination, during, an, outbreak, is, as, beneficial, as, therapeutic, treatment, in, cattle, and, this, method, is, also, used, in, horses, and, pheasants, the, use, of, region, specific, toxoids, to, immunize, animals, has, been, shown, to, be, effective, toxoid, types, c, and, d, used, to, immunize, cattle, is, a, useful, vaccination, method, in, south, africa, and, australia, toxoid, has, also, been, shown, to, be, an, appropriate, method, of, immunizing, minks, and, pheasants, in, endemic, areas, for, example, kentucky, vaccination, with, type, b, toxoid, appears, to, be, effective, based, on, cia, research, in, fort, detrick, on, biological, warfare, anthrax, and, botulism, were, widely, regarded, as, the, two, most, effective, options, during, the, 1950s, a, highly, lethal, strain, was, discovered, during, the, biological, warfare, program, the, cia, continued, to, hold, 5, grams, of, clostridium, botulinum, even, after, nixon, s, ban, on, biological, warfare, in, 1969, during, the, gulf, war, when, the, united, states, were, concerned, with, a, potential, biowarfare, attack, the, efforts, around, botulism, turned, to, prevention, however, the, only, way, to, make, antitoxin, in, america, until, the, 1990s, was, by, drawing, antibodies, from, a, single, horse, named, first, flight, raising, much, concern, from, pentagon, health, officials, iraq, has, historically, possessed, many, types, of, germs, including, botulism, the, american, type, culture, collection, sold, 5, variants, of, botulinum, to, the, university, of, baghdad, in, may, 1986, 1991, cia, reports, also, show, iraqis, filled, shells, warheads, and, bombs, with, biological, agents, like, botulinum, though, none, have, been, deployed, the, iraqi, air, force, used, the, code, name, tea, to, refer, to, botulinum, and, it, was, also, referred, to, as, bioweapon, a, a, japanese, cult, called, aum, shinrikyo, created, laboratories, that, produced, biological, weapons, specifically, botulinum, anthrax, and, q, fever, from, 1990, to, 1995, the, cult, staged, numerous, unsuccessful, bioterrorism, attacks, on, civilians, they, sprayed, botulinum, toxin, from, a, truck, in, downtown, tokyo, and, in, the, narita, airport, but, there, are, no, reported, cases, of, botulism, as, a, result
