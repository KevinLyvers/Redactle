catoprion, pristobrycon, pygocentrus, pygopristis, serrasalmus, megapiranha, a, piranha, or, pira, a, p, r, n, j, r, n, or, p, r, n, portuguese, spanish, is, any, of, a, number, of, freshwater, fish, species, in, the, family, serrasalmidae, or, the, subfamily, serrasalminae, within, the, tetra, family, characidae, in, order, characiformes, these, fish, inhabit, south, american, rivers, floodplains, lakes, and, reservoirs, although, often, described, as, extremely, predatory, and, mainly, feeding, on, fish, their, dietary, habits, vary, extensively, and, they, will, also, take, plant, material, leading, to, their, classification, as, omnivorous, the, name, originates, from, the, indigenous, tupi, people, and, their, respective, tupi, language, it, is, formed, from, two, words, pir, meaning, fish, and, sainha, meaning, tooth, the, same, word, is, used, by, indians, to, describe, a, pair, of, scissors, another, possible, derivation, is, from, pira, nya, probably, literally, biting, fish, in, the, mid, 18th, century, the, portuguese, merged, the, word, into, piranha, finally, the, word, may, also, come, from, the, combination, of, pir, fish, and, nha, cut, which, also, meant, bad, or, devil, in, tupi, guarani, piranhas, belong, to, the, family, serrasalmidae, which, includes, closely, related, omnivorous, fish, such, as, pacus, traditionally, only, the, four, genera, pristobrycon, pygocentrus, pygopristis, and, serrasalmus, are, considered, to, be, true, piranhas, due, to, their, specialized, teeth, however, a, recent, analysis, showed, if, the, piranha, group, is, to, be, monophyletic, it, should, be, restricted, to, serrasalmus, pygocentrus, and, part, of, pristobrycon, or, expanded, to, include, these, taxa, plus, pygopristis, catoprion, and, pristobrycon, striolatus, pygopristis, was, found, to, be, more, closely, related, to, catoprion, than, the, other, three, piranha, genera, the, total, number, of, piranha, species, is, unknown, and, contested, and, new, species, continue, to, be, described, estimates, range, from, fewer, than, 30, to, more, than, 60, piranhas, are, indigenous, to, the, amazon, basin, in, the, orinoco, in, rivers, of, the, guianas, in, the, paraguay, paran, and, the, s, o, francisco, river, systems, but, there, are, major, differences, in, the, species, richness, in, a, review, where, 38, 39, piranha, species, were, recognized, 25, were, from, the, amazon, and, 16, from, orinoco, while, only, three, were, present, in, paraguay, paran, and, two, in, s, o, francisco, most, species, are, restricted, to, a, single, river, system, but, some, such, as, the, red, bellied, piranha, occur, in, several, many, species, can, occur, together, for, example, seven, are, found, in, ca, o, maporal, a, stream, in, venezuela, aquarium, piranhas, have, been, unsuccessfully, introduced, into, parts, of, the, united, states, in, many, cases, however, reported, captures, of, piranhas, are, misidentifications, of, pacu, e, g, red, bellied, pacu, or, piaractus, brachypomus, is, frequently, misidentified, as, red, bellied, piranha, or, pygocentrus, nattereri, piranhas, have, also, been, discovered, in, the, kaptai, lake, in, southeast, bangladesh, research, is, being, carried, out, to, establish, how, piranhas, have, moved, to, such, distant, corners, of, the, world, from, their, original, habitat, some, rogue, exotic, fish, traders, are, thought, to, have, released, them, in, the, lake, to, avoid, being, caught, by, antipoaching, forces, piranhas, were, also, spotted, in, the, lijiang, river, in, china, depending, on, the, exact, species, most, piranhas, grow, to, between, 12, and, 35, cm, 5, 14, in, long, a, few, can, grow, larger, with, the, largest, living, species, the, red, bellied, reaching, up, to, 50, cm, 20, in, there, are, claims, of, s, o, francisco, piranhas, at, up, to, 60, cm, 24, in, but, the, largest, confirmed, specimens, are, considerably, smaller, the, extinct, megapiranha, which, lived, 8, 10, million, years, ago, reached, about, 71, cm, 28, in, long, and, possibly, even, 128, cm, 50, in, serrasalmus, pristobrycon, pygocentrus, and, pygopristis, are, most, easily, recognized, by, their, unique, dentition, all, piranhas, have, a, single, row, of, sharp, teeth, in, both, jaws, the, teeth, are, tightly, packed, and, interlocking, via, small, cusps, and, are, used, for, rapid, puncture, and, shearing, individual, teeth, are, typically, broadly, triangular, pointed, and, blade, like, flat, in, profile, the, variation, in, the, number, of, cusps, is, minor, in, most, species, the, teeth, are, tricuspid, with, a, larger, middle, cusp, which, makes, the, individual, teeth, appear, markedly, triangular, the, exception, is, pygopristis, which, has, pentacuspid, teeth, and, a, middle, cusp, usually, only, slightly, larger, than, the, other, cusps, piranhas, have, one, of, the, strongest, bites, found, in, bony, fishes, relative, to, body, mass, the, black, piranha, serrasalmus, rhombeus, produces, one, of, the, most, forceful, bites, measured, in, vertebrates, this, extremely, powerful, and, dangerous, bite, is, generated, by, large, jaw, muscles, adductor, mandibulae, that, are, attached, closely, to, the, tip, of, the, jaw, conferring, the, piranha, with, a, mechanical, advantage, that, favors, force, production, over, bite, speed, strong, jaws, combined, with, finely, serrated, teeth, make, them, adept, at, tearing, flesh, piranhas, vary, extensively, in, ecology, and, behavior, depending, on, exact, species, piranhas, especially, the, red, bellied, pygocentrus, nattereri, have, a, reputation, as, ferocious, predators, that, hunt, their, prey, in, schools, recent, research, however, which, started, off, with, the, premise, that, they, school, as, a, means, of, cooperative, hunting, discovered, they, are, timid, fish, that, schooled, for, protection, from, their, own, predators, such, as, cormorants, caimans, and, dolphins, piranhas, are, basically, like, regular, fish, with, large, teeth, a, few, other, species, may, also, occur, in, large, groups, while, the, remaining, are, solitary, or, found, in, small, groups, although, popularly, described, as, highly, predatory, and, primarily, feeding, on, fish, piranha, diets, vary, extensively, leading, to, their, classification, as, omnivorous, in, addition, to, fish, occasionally, even, their, own, species, documented, food, items, for, piranhas, include, other, vertebrates, mammals, birds, reptiles, invertebrates, insects, crustaceans, fruits, seeds, leaves, and, detritus, the, diet, often, shifts, with, age, and, size, research, on, the, species, serrasalmus, aff, brandtii, and, pygocentrus, nattereri, in, viana, lake, in, maranh, o, which, is, formed, during, the, wet, season, when, the, pindar, river, a, tributary, of, the, mearim, river, floods, has, shown, that, they, primarily, feed, on, fish, but, also, eat, vegetable, matter, in, another, study, of, more, than, 250, serrasalmus, rhombeus, at, ji, paran, machado, river, 75, to, 81, depending, on, season, of, the, stomach, content, was, fish, but, about, 10, was, fruits, or, seeds, in, a, few, species, such, as, serrasalmus, serrulatus, the, dietary, split, may, be, more, equal, but, this, is, less, certain, as, based, on, smaller, samples, among, 24, s, serrulatus, from, flooded, forests, of, ji, paran, machado, river, there, were, several, with, fish, remains, in, their, stomachs, but, half, contained, masticated, seeds, and, in, most, of, these, this, was, the, dominant, item, piranhas, will, often, scavenge, and, some, species, such, as, serrasalmus, elongatus, are, specialized, scale, eaters, feeding, primarily, on, scales, and, fins, of, other, fish, scale, and, fin, eating, is, more, widespread, among, juvenile, and, sub, adult, piranhas, piranhas, lay, their, eggs, in, pits, dug, during, the, breeding, season, and, swim, around, to, protect, them, newly, hatched, young, feed, on, zooplankton, and, eventually, move, on, to, small, fish, once, large, enough, piranha, teeth, are, often, used, as, tools, themselves, such, as, for, carving, wood, or, cutting, hair, or, to, modify, other, tools, such, as, sharpening, of, darts, this, practice, has, been, documented, among, several, south, american, tribes, including, the, camayura, and, shavante, in, brazil, and, the, pacahuara, in, bolivia, piranhas, are, also, popular, as, food, being, both, eaten, as, a, subsistence, catch, by, fishers, and, sold, at, market, however, they, are, often, considered, a, nuisance, by, fishers, because, they, steal, bait, eat, catches, damage, fishing, gear, and, may, bite, when, accidentally, caught, piranhas, can, be, bought, as, pets, in, some, areas, but, they, are, illegal, in, many, parts, of, the, united, states, and, in, the, philippines, where, importers, face, six, months, to, four, years, in, jail, and, the, piranhas, are, destroyed, to, prevent, proliferation, the, most, common, aquarium, piranha, is, pygocentrus, nattereri, the, red, bellied, piranha, piranhas, can, be, bought, fully, grown, or, as, young, often, no, larger, than, a, thumbnail, it, is, important, to, keep, pygocentrus, piranhas, alone, or, in, groups, of, four, or, more, not, in, pairs, since, aggression, among, them, is, common, not, allowing, the, weaker, fish, to, survive, and, is, distributed, more, widely, when, kept, in, larger, groups, it, is, not, uncommon, to, find, individual, piranhas, with, one, eye, missing, due, to, a, previous, attack, although, often, described, as, extremely, dangerous, in, the, media, piranhas, typically, do, not, represent, a, serious, risk, to, humans, however, attacks, have, occurred, especially, when, the, piranhas, are, in, a, stressed, situation, such, as, the, dense, groups, that, may, occur, when, the, water, is, lower, during, the, dry, season, and, food, is, relatively, scarce, swimming, near, fishermen, may, increase, the, risk, of, attacks, due, to, the, commotion, caused, by, struggling, fish, and, the, presence, of, bait, in, the, water, splashing, attracts, piranhas, and, for, this, reason, children, are, more, often, attacked, than, adults, being, in, the, water, when, already, injured, or, otherwise, incapacitated, also, increases, the, risk, there, are, sometimes, warning, signs, at, high, risk, locations, and, beaches, in, such, areas, are, sometimes, protected, by, a, barrier, most, piranha, attacks, on, humans, only, result, in, minor, injuries, typically, to, the, feet, or, hands, but, they, are, occasionally, more, serious, and, very, rarely, can, be, fatal, near, the, city, of, palmas, in, brazil, 190, piranha, attacks, all, involving, single, bites, to, the, feet, were, reported, in, the, first, half, of, 2007, in, an, artificial, lake, which, appeared, after, the, damming, of, the, tocantins, river, in, the, state, of, s, o, paulo, a, series, of, attacks, in, 2009, in, the, tiet, river, resulted, in, minor, injuries, to, 15, people, in, 2011, another, series, of, attacks, at, jos, de, freitas, in, the, brazilian, state, of, piau, resulted, in, 100, people, being, treated, for, bites, to, their, toes, or, heels, on, 25, december, 2013, more, than, 70, bathers, were, attacked, at, rosario, in, argentina, causing, injuries, to, their, hands, or, feet, in, 2011, a, drunk, 18, year, old, man, was, attacked, and, killed, in, rosario, del, yata, bolivia, in, 2012, a, five, year, old, brazilian, girl, was, attacked, and, killed, by, a, shoal, of, p, nattereri, in, january, 2015, a, six, year, old, girl, was, found, dead, with, signs, of, piranha, bites, on, part, of, her, body, after, her, family, canoe, capsized, during, a, vacation, in, monte, alegre, brazil, whereas, fatal, attacks, on, humans, are, rare, piranhas, will, readily, feed, on, bodies, of, people, that, already, have, died, such, as, drowning, victims, various, stories, exist, about, piranhas, such, as, how, they, can, skeletonize, a, human, body, or, cattle, in, seconds, these, legends, refer, specifically, to, the, red, bellied, piranha, piranha, solution, a, dangerous, mixture, of, sulfuric, acid, and, hydrogen, peroxide, known, to, aggressively, dissolve, organic, material, draws, its, name, from, these, legends, surrounding, the, piranha, fish, a, common, falsehood, is, that, they, can, be, attracted, by, blood, and, are, exclusively, carnivores, a, brazilian, legend, called, piranha, cattle, states, that, they, sweep, the, rivers, at, high, speed, and, attack, the, first, of, the, cattle, entering, the, water, allowing, the, rest, of, the, group, to, traverse, the, river, these, legends, were, dismissed, through, research, by, h, lder, queiroz, and, anne, magurran, and, published, in, biology, letters, when, former, us, president, theodore, roosevelt, visited, brazil, in, 1913, he, went, on, a, hunting, expedition, through, the, amazon, rainforest, while, standing, on, the, bank, of, the, amazon, river, he, witnessed, a, spectacle, created, by, local, fishermen, after, blocking, off, part, of, the, river, and, starving, the, piranhas, for, several, days, they, pushed, a, cow, into, the, water, where, it, was, quickly, torn, apart, and, skeletonized, by, a, school, of, hungry, piranhas, roosevelt, later, described, piranhas, as, vicious, creatures, in, his, 1914, book, through, the, brazilian, wilderness
