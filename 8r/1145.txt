garlic, allium, sativum, is, a, species, of, bulbous, flowering, plant, in, the, genus, allium, its, close, relatives, include, the, onion, shallot, leek, chive, welsh, onion, and, chinese, onion, it, is, native, to, central, asia, south, asia, and, northeastern, iran, and, has, long, been, used, as, a, seasoning, worldwide, with, a, history, of, several, thousand, years, of, human, consumption, and, use, it, was, known, to, ancient, egyptians, and, has, been, used, as, both, a, food, flavoring, and, a, traditional, medicine, china, produced, 73, of, the, world, s, supply, of, garlic, in, 2021, allium, sativum, is, a, perennial, flowering, plant, that, grows, from, a, bulb, it, has, a, tall, erect, flowering, stem, that, grows, up, to, 1, m, 3, ft, the, leaf, blade, is, flat, linear, solid, and, approximately, 1, 25, 2, 5, cm, 0, 5, 1, 0, in, wide, with, an, acute, apex, the, plant, may, produce, pink, to, purple, flowers, from, july, to, september, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, bulb, has, a, strong, odor, and, is, typically, made, up, of, 10, to, 20, cloves, the, cloves, close, to, the, center, are, symmetrical, and, those, surrounding, the, center, can, be, asymmetrical, each, clove, is, enclosed, in, an, inner, sheathing, leaf, surrounded, by, layers, of, outer, sheathing, leaves, if, garlic, is, planted, at, the, proper, time, and, depth, it, can, be, grown, as, far, north, as, alaska, it, produces, hermaphroditic, flowers, it, is, pollinated, by, bees, butterflies, moths, and, other, insects, fresh, or, crushed, garlic, yields, the, sulfur, containing, compounds, allicin, ajoene, diallyl, polysulfides, vinyldithiins, and, s, allylcysteine, as, well, as, enzymes, saponins, flavonoids, and, maillard, reaction, products, when, cooked, which, are, not, sulfur, containing, compounds, the, phytochemicals, responsible, for, the, sharp, flavor, of, garlic, are, produced, when, the, plant, s, cells, are, damaged, when, a, cell, is, broken, by, chopping, chewing, or, crushing, enzymes, stored, in, cell, vacuoles, trigger, the, breakdown, of, several, sulfur, containing, compounds, stored, in, the, cell, fluids, cytosol, the, resultant, compounds, are, responsible, for, the, sharp, or, hot, taste, and, strong, smell, of, garlic, some, of, the, compounds, are, unstable, and, continue, to, react, over, time, among, alliums, garlic, has, by, far, the, highest, concentrations, of, initial, reaction, products, making, garlic, much, more, potent, than, onion, shallot, or, leeks, although, many, humans, enjoy, the, taste, of, garlic, these, compounds, are, believed, to, have, evolved, as, a, defensive, mechanism, deterring, animals, such, as, birds, insects, and, worms, from, eating, the, plant, a, large, number, of, sulfur, compounds, contribute, to, the, smell, and, taste, of, garlic, allicin, has, been, found, to, be, the, compound, most, responsible, for, the, hot, sensation, of, raw, garlic, this, chemical, opens, thermo, transient, receptor, potential, channels, that, are, responsible, for, the, burning, sense, of, heat, in, foods, the, process, of, cooking, garlic, removes, allicin, thus, mellowing, its, spiciness, allicin, along, with, its, decomposition, products, diallyl, disulfide, and, diallyl, trisulfide, are, major, contributors, to, the, characteristic, odor, of, garlic, with, other, allicin, derived, compounds, such, as, vinyldithiins, and, ajoene, identification, of, the, wild, progenitor, of, common, garlic, is, difficult, due, to, the, sterility, of, its, many, cultivars, which, limits, the, ability, to, cross, test, with, wild, relatives, genetically, and, morphologically, garlic, is, most, similar, to, the, wild, species, allium, longicuspis, which, grows, in, central, and, southwestern, asia, however, because, a, longicuspis, is, also, mostly, sterile, it, is, doubtful, that, it, is, the, ancestor, of, a, sativum, other, candidates, that, have, been, suggested, include, a, tuncelianum, a, macrochaetum, and, a, truncatum, all, of, which, are, native, to, the, middle, east, allium, sativum, grows, in, the, wild, in, areas, where, it, has, become, naturalized, the, wild, garlic, crow, garlic, and, field, garlic, of, britain, are, members, of, the, species, a, ursinum, a, vineale, and, a, oleraceum, respectively, in, north, america, a, vineale, known, as, wild, garlic, or, crow, garlic, and, allium, canadense, known, as, meadow, garlic, wild, garlic, or, wild, onion, are, common, weeds, in, fields, so, called, elephant, garlic, is, actually, a, wild, leek, a, ampeloprasum, and, not, a, true, garlic, single, clove, garlic, also, called, pearl, or, solo, garlic, originated, in, the, yunnan, province, of, china, there, are, two, subspecies, of, a, sativum, ten, major, groups, of, varieties, and, hundreds, of, varieties, or, cultivars, there, are, at, least, 120, cultivars, originating, from, central, asia, making, it, the, main, center, of, garlic, biodiversity, some, garlics, have, protected, status, in, the, uk, and, the, eu, including, the, word, garlic, derives, from, old, english, garl, ac, meaning, gar, spear, and, leek, as, a, spear, shaped, leek, garlic, plants, are, usually, hardy, and, not, affected, by, many, pests, or, diseases, garlic, plants, are, said, to, repel, rabbits, and, moles, the, california, department, of, food, and, agriculture, conducts, a, certification, program, to, assure, freedom, from, nematode, and, white, rot, disease, caused, by, stromatinia, cepivora, two, pathogens, that, can, both, destroy, a, crop, and, remain, in, the, soil, indefinitely, once, introduced, garlic, may, also, suffer, from, pink, root, a, typically, non, fatal, disease, that, stunts, the, roots, and, turns, them, pink, or, red, or, leek, rust, which, usually, appears, as, bright, orange, spots, the, larvae, of, the, leek, moth, attack, garlic, by, mining, into, the, leaves, or, bulbs, botrytis, neck, and, bulb, rot, is, a, disease, of, onion, garlic, leek, and, shallot, botrytis, allii, and, botrytis, aclada, cause, this, disease, in, onion, and, botrytis, porri, causes, it, in, garlic, according, to, the, university, of, california, initial, symptoms, usually, begin, at, the, neck, where, affected, tissue, softens, becomes, water, soaked, and, turns, brown, in, a, humid, atmosphere, a, gray, and, feltlike, growth, where, spores, are, produced, appears, on, rotting, scales, and, mycelia, may, develop, between, scales, dark, brown, to, black, sclerotia, the, resting, bodies, of, the, pathogen, may, eventually, develop, in, the, neck, or, between, scales, garlic, is, easy, to, grow, and, can, be, grown, year, round, in, mild, climates, while, sexual, propagation, of, garlic, is, possible, nearly, all, of, the, garlic, in, cultivation, is, propagated, asexually, by, planting, individual, cloves, in, the, ground, in, colder, climates, cloves, are, best, planted, about, six, weeks, before, the, soil, freezes, the, goal, is, to, have, the, bulbs, produce, only, roots, and, no, shoots, above, the, ground, harvest, is, in, late, spring, or, early, summer, garlic, plants, can, be, grown, closely, together, leaving, enough, space, for, the, bulbs, to, mature, and, are, easily, grown, in, containers, of, sufficient, depth, garlic, does, well, in, loose, dry, well, drained, soils, in, sunny, locations, and, is, hardy, throughout, usda, climate, zones, 4, 9, when, selecting, garlic, for, planting, it, is, important, to, pick, large, bulbs, from, which, to, separate, cloves, large, cloves, along, with, proper, spacing, in, the, planting, bed, will, also, increase, bulb, size, garlic, plants, prefer, to, grow, in, a, soil, with, a, high, organic, material, content, but, are, capable, of, growing, in, a, wide, range, of, soil, conditions, and, ph, levels, there, are, different, varieties, of, garlic, most, notably, split, into, the, subspecies, of, hardneck, garlic, and, softneck, garlic, the, latitude, where, the, garlic, is, grown, affects, the, choice, of, type, as, garlic, can, be, day, length, sensitive, hardneck, garlic, is, generally, grown, in, cooler, climates, and, produces, relatively, large, cloves, whereas, softneck, garlic, is, generally, grown, closer, to, the, equator, and, produces, small, tightly, packed, cloves, garlic, scapes, are, removed, to, focus, all, the, garlic, s, energy, into, bulb, growth, the, scapes, can, be, eaten, raw, or, cooked, in, 2021, world, production, of, garlic, was, 28, million, tonnes, with, china, alone, accounting, for, 73, of, the, total, the, scent, of, garlic, is, known, to, linger, upon, the, human, body, and, cause, bad, breath, halitosis, and, body, odor, this, is, caused, by, allyl, methyl, sulfide, ams, ams, is, a, volatile, liquid, which, is, absorbed, into, the, blood, during, the, metabolism, of, garlic, derived, sulfur, compounds, from, the, blood, it, travels, to, the, lungs, and, from, there, to, the, mouth, causing, garlic, breath, and, skin, where, it, is, exuded, through, skin, pores, washing, the, skin, with, soap, is, only, a, partial, and, imperfect, solution, to, the, smell, studies, have, shown, sipping, milk, at, the, same, time, as, consuming, garlic, can, significantly, neutralize, bad, breath, mixing, garlic, with, milk, in, the, mouth, before, swallowing, reduced, the, odor, better, than, drinking, milk, afterward, plain, water, mushrooms, and, basil, may, also, reduce, the, odor, the, mix, of, fat, and, water, found, in, milk, however, was, the, most, effective, garlic, breath, is, allegedly, alleviated, by, eating, fresh, parsley, when, eaten, in, quantity, garlic, may, be, strongly, evident, in, the, sweat, and, breath, for, the, following, day, this, is, because, garlic, s, sulfur, compounds, are, metabolized, forming, ams, which, cannot, be, digested, and, is, passed, into, the, blood, it, is, carried, to, the, lungs, and, the, skin, where, it, is, excreted, since, digestion, takes, several, hours, and, release, of, ams, several, hours, more, the, effect, of, eating, garlic, may, be, present, for, a, long, time, abundant, sulfur, compounds, in, garlic, are, also, responsible, for, turning, garlic, green, or, blue, during, pickling, and, cooking, under, these, conditions, i, e, acidity, heat, the, sulfur, containing, compound, alliin, reacts, with, common, amino, acids, to, make, pyrroles, clusters, of, carbon, nitrogen, rings, these, rings, can, be, linked, together, into, polypyrrole, molecules, ring, structures, absorb, particular, wavelengths, of, light, and, thus, appear, colored, the, two, pyrrole, molecule, looks, red, the, three, pyrrole, molecule, looks, blue, and, the, four, pyrrole, molecule, looks, green, like, chlorophyll, a, tetrapyrrole, like, chlorophyll, the, pyrrole, pigments, are, safe, to, eat, upon, cutting, similar, to, a, color, change, in, onion, caused, by, reactions, of, amino, acids, with, sulfur, compounds, garlic, can, turn, green, the, green, dry, folds, in, the, center, of, the, garlic, clove, are, especially, pungent, the, sulfur, compound, allicin, produced, by, crushing, or, chewing, fresh, garlic, produces, other, sulfur, compounds, ajoene, allyl, polysulfides, and, vinyldithiins, aged, garlic, lacks, allicin, but, may, have, some, activity, due, to, the, presence, of, s, allylcysteine, some, people, suffer, from, allergies, to, garlic, and, other, species, of, allium, symptoms, can, include, irritable, bowel, diarrhea, mouth, and, throat, ulcerations, nausea, breathing, difficulties, and, in, rare, cases, anaphylaxis, garlic, sensitive, people, show, positive, tests, to, diallyl, disulfide, allylpropyldisulfide, allylmercaptan, and, allicin, all, of, which, are, present, in, garlic, people, who, suffer, from, garlic, allergies, are, often, sensitive, to, many, other, plants, including, onions, chives, leeks, shallots, garden, lilies, ginger, and, bananas, several, reports, of, serious, burns, resulting, from, garlic, being, applied, topically, for, various, purposes, including, naturopathic, uses, and, acne, treatment, indicate, care, must, be, taken, for, these, uses, usually, testing, a, small, area, of, skin, using, a, low, concentration, of, garlic, on, the, basis, of, numerous, reports, of, such, burns, including, burns, to, children, topical, use, of, raw, garlic, as, well, as, insertion, of, raw, garlic, into, body, cavities, is, discouraged, in, particular, topical, application, of, raw, garlic, to, young, children, is, not, advisable, the, side, effects, of, long, term, garlic, supplementation, are, largely, unknown, possible, side, effects, include, gastrointestinal, discomfort, sweating, dizziness, allergic, reactions, bleeding, and, menstrual, irregularities, some, breastfeeding, mothers, have, found, after, consuming, garlic, that, their, babies, can, be, slow, to, feed, and, have, noted, a, garlic, odor, coming, from, them, if, higher, than, recommended, doses, of, garlic, are, taken, with, anticoagulant, medications, this, can, lead, to, a, higher, risk, of, bleeding, garlic, may, interact, with, warfarin, saquinavir, antihypertensives, calcium, channel, blockers, the, quinolone, family, of, antibiotics, such, as, ciprofloxacin, and, hypoglycemic, drugs, as, well, as, other, medications, the, american, veterinary, medical, association, considers, garlic, to, be, toxic, to, pets, because, of, sulfur, compounds, circulating, in, blood, consumed, garlic, may, act, as, a, mosquito, repellent, although, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, of, its, efficacy, in, the, typical, serving, size, of, 1, 3, cloves, 3, 9, grams, raw, garlic, provides, no, significant, nutritional, value, with, the, content, of, all, essential, nutrients, below, 10, of, the, daily, value, dv, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, g, 3, 5, oz,

gram, serving, raw, garlic, is, a, moderate, source, 10, 19, dv, of, the, b, vitamins, thiamin, and, pantothenic, acid, as, well, as, the, dietary, minerals, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and, zinc, the, composition, of, raw, garlic, is, 59, water, 33, carbohydrates, 6, protein, 2, dietary, fiber, and, less, than, 1, fat, garlic, is, widely, used, around, the, world, for, its, pungent, flavor, as, a, seasoning, or, condiment, the, garlic, plant, s, bulb, is, the, most, commonly, used, part, of, the, plant, with, the, exception, of, the, single, clove, types, garlic, bulbs, are, normally, divided, into, numerous, fleshy, sections, called, cloves, garlic, cloves, are, used, for, consumption, raw, or, cooked, or, for, medicinal, purposes, they, have, a, characteristic, pungent, spicy, flavor, that, mellows, and, sweetens, considerably, with, cooking, the, distinctive, aroma, is, mainly, due, to, organosulfur, compounds, including, allicin, present, in, fresh, garlic, cloves, and, ajoene, which, forms, when, they, are, crushed, or, chopped, a, further, metabolite, allyl, methyl, sulfide, is, responsible, for, garlic, breath, other, parts, of, the, garlic, plant, are, also, edible, the, leaves, and, flowers, bulbils, on, the, head, spathe, are, sometimes, eaten, they, are, milder, in, flavor, than, the, bulbs, and, are, most, often, consumed, while, immature, and, still, tender, immature, garlic, is, sometimes, pulled, rather, like, a, scallion, and, sold, as, green, garlic, when, green, garlic, is, allowed, to, grow, past, the, scallion, stage, but, not, permitted, to, fully, mature, it, may, produce, a, garlic, round, a, bulb, like, a, boiling, onion, but, not, separated, into, cloves, like, a, mature, bulb, green, garlic, imparts, a, garlic, flavor, and, aroma, in, food, minus, the, spiciness, green, garlic, is, often, chopped, and, stir, fried, or, cooked, in, soup, or, hot, pot, in, southeast, asian, i, e, vietnamese, thai, myanmar, lao, cambodian, singaporean, and, chinese, cookery, and, is, very, abundant, and, low, priced, additionally, the, immature, flower, stalks, scapes, of, the, hardneck, are, sometimes, marketed, for, uses, similar, to, asparagus, in, stir, fries, inedible, or, rarely, eaten, parts, of, the, garlic, plant, include, the, skin, covering, each, clove, and, root, cluster, the, papery, protective, layers, of, skin, over, various, parts, of, the, plant, are, generally, discarded, during, preparation, for, most, culinary, uses, though, in, korea, immature, whole, heads, are, sometimes, prepared, with, the, tender, skins, intact, the, root, cluster, attached, to, the, basal, plate, of, the, bulb, is, the, only, part, not, typically, considered, palatable, in, any, form, an, alternative, is, to, cut, the, top, off, the, bulb, coat, the, cloves, by, dribbling, olive, oil, or, other, oil, based, seasoning, over, them, and, roast, them, in, an, oven, garlic, softens, and, can, be, extracted, from, the, cloves, by, squeezing, the, root, end, of, the, bulb, or, individually, by, squeezing, one, end, of, the, clove, in, korea, heads, of, garlic, are, heated, over, the, course, of, several, weeks, the,
