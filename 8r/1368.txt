injury, is, physiological, damage, to, the, living, tissue, of, any, organism, whether, in, humans, in, other, animals, or, in, plants, injuries, can, be, caused, in, many, ways, including, mechanically, with, penetration, by, sharp, objects, such, as, teeth, or, with, blunt, objects, by, heat, or, cold, or, by, venoms, and, biotoxins, injury, prompts, an, inflammatory, response, in, many, taxa, of, animals, this, prompts, wound, healing, in, both, plants, and, animals, substances, are, often, released, to, help, to, occlude, the, wound, limiting, loss, of, fluids, and, the, entry, of, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, many, organisms, secrete, antimicrobial, chemicals, which, limit, wound, infection, in, addition, animals, have, a, variety, of, immune, responses, for, the, same, purpose, both, plants, and, animals, have, regrowth, mechanisms, which, may, result, in, complete, or, partial, healing, over, the, injury, cells, too, can, repair, damage, to, a, certain, degree, injury, in, animals, is, sometimes, defined, as, mechanical, damage, to, anatomical, structure, but, it, has, a, wider, connotation, of, physical, damage, with, any, cause, including, drowning, burns, and, poisoning, such, damage, may, result, from, attempted, predation, territorial, fights, falls, and, abiotic, factors, injury, prompts, an, inflammatory, response, in, animals, of, many, different, phyla, this, prompts, coagulation, of, the, blood, or, body, fluid, followed, by, wound, healing, which, may, be, rapid, as, in, the, cnidaria, arthropods, are, able, to, repair, injuries, to, the, cuticle, that, forms, their, exoskeleton, to, some, extent, animals, in, several, phyla, including, annelids, arthropods, cnidaria, molluscs, nematodes, and, vertebrates, are, able, to, produce, antimicrobial, peptides, to, fight, off, infection, following, an, injury, injury, in, humans, has, been, studied, extensively, for, its, importance, in, medicine, much, of, medical, practice, including, emergency, medicine, and, pain, management, is, dedicated, to, the, treatment, of, injuries, the, world, health, organization, has, developed, a, classification, of, injuries, in, humans, by, categories, including, mechanism, objects, substances, producing, injury, place, of, occurrence, activity, when, injured, and, the, role, of, human, intent, in, addition, to, physical, harm, injuries, can, cause, psychological, harm, including, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, in, plants, injuries, result, from, the, eating, of, plant, parts, by, herbivorous, animals, including, insects, and, mammals, from, damage, to, tissues, by, plant, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, and, fungi, which, may, gain, entry, after, herbivore, damage, or, in, other, ways, and, from, abiotic, factors, such, as, heat, freezing, flooding, lightning, and, pollutants, such, as, ozone, plants, respond, to, injury, by, signalling, that, damage, has, occurred, by, secreting, materials, to, seal, off, the, damaged, area, by, producing, antimicrobial, chemicals, and, in, woody, plants, by, regrowing, over, wounds, cell, injury, is, a, variety, of, changes, of, stress, that, a, cell, suffers, due, to, external, as, well, as, internal, environmental, changes, amongst, other, causes, this, can, be, due, to, physical, chemical, infectious, biological, nutritional, or, immunological, factors, cell, damage, can, be, reversible, or, irreversible, depending, on, the, extent, of, injury, the, cellular, response, may, be, adaptive, and, where, possible, homeostasis, is, restored, cell, death, occurs, when, the, severity, of, the, injury, exceeds, the, cell, s, ability, to, repair, itself, cell, death, is, relative, to, both, the, length, of, exposure, to, a, harmful, stimulus, and, the, severity, of, the, damage, caused
