the, araceae, are, a, family, of, monocotyledonous, flowering, plants, in, which, flowers, are, borne, on, a, type, of, inflorescence, called, a, spadix, the, spadix, is, usually, accompanied, by, and, sometimes, partially, enclosed, in, a, spathe, or, leaf, like, bract, also, known, as, the, arum, family, members, are, often, colloquially, known, as, aroids, this, family, of, 114, genera, and, about, 3, 750, known, species, is, most, diverse, in, the, new, world, tropics, although, also, distributed, in, the, old, world, tropics, and, northern, temperate, regions, within, the, araceae, species, are, often, rhizomatous, or, tuberous, many, are, epiphytic, creeping, lianas, or, vining, plants, and, the, leaves, and, tissues, of, the, entire, plant, nearly, always, contains, irritating, calcium, oxalate, crystals, or, raphides, in, varying, degrees, the, foliage, can, vary, considerably, from, species, to, species, the, majority, of, species, produce, an, inflorescence, consisting, of, a, spadix, which, some, compare, to, a, corn, cob, in, appearance, which, is, nearly, always, surrounded, by, a, modified, leaf, bract, called, a, spathe, in, monoecious, aroids, possessing, separate, male, and, female, flowers, but, with, both, flowers, present, on, one, plant, the, spadix, is, usually, organized, with, female, flowers, towards, the, bottom, and, male, flowers, at, the, top, in, aroids, with, perfect, flowers, the, stigma, is, no, longer, receptive, when, the, pollen, is, released, thus, preventing, self, fertilization, some, species, are, dioecious, many, plants, in, this, family, are, thermogenic, heat, producing, their, flowers, can, reach, up, to, 45, c, even, if, the, surrounding, air, temperature, is, much, lower, one, reason, for, this, unusually, high, temperature, is, to, attract, insects, usually, beetles, to, pollinate, the, plant, rewarding, the, beetles, with, heat, energy, in, addition, to, preventing, tissue, damage, in, colder, regions, some, examples, of, thermogenic, aroids, are, symplocarpus, foetidus, eastern, skunk, cabbage, amorphophallus, titanum, titan, arum, amorphophallus, paeoniifolius, elephant, foot, yam, helicodiceros, muscivorus, dead, horse, arum, lily, and, sauromatum, venosum, voodoo, lily, some, species, such, as, a, titanum, and, h, muscivorus, give, off, a, very, pungent, smell, akin, to, rotten, meat, which, serves, to, attract, flies, for, pollination, the, heat, produced, by, the, plant, helps, to, convey, the, scent, further, within, the, araceae, family, the, majority, of, species, produce, calcium, oxalate, crystals, in, the, form, of, raphides, while, it, is, possible, to, consume, the, cooked, foliage, of, certain, genera, such, as, alocasia, colocasia, and, xanthosoma, as, well, as, the, ripened, fruits, of, monstera, deliciosa, these, raphide, compounds, are, irritating, and, even, dangerous, for, many, animals, including, humans, consumption, of, raw, aroid, vegetation, may, cause, edema, vesicle, formation, or, dysphagia, accompanied, by, a, painful, stinging, and, burning, in, the, mouth, and, throat, with, symptoms, occurring, for, up, to, two, weeks, depending, on, amount, consumed, in, smaller, amounts, patients, report, feeling, a, mild, to, extreme, sensation, of, sand, or, glass, in, the, esophagus, and, mouth, lasting, up, to, 48, hours, additionally, in, heavier, instances, of, ingestion, anaphylactic, shock, could, cause, swelling, of, the, throat, restricting, breathing, the, genus, dieffenbachia, is, famously, known, as, dumb, cane, for, this, reason, however, given, the, presence, of, irritating, compounds, across, the, family, this, nickname, may, be, applied, to, virtually, any, genera, within, the, araceae, phylogeny, based, on, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, website, gymnostachydoideae, bogner, nicolson, 1991, orontioideae, brown, ex, m, ller, 1860, lemnoideae, pothoideae, engler, 1876, monsteroideae, engler, 1876, lasioideae, engler, 1876, zamioculcadoideae, bogner, hesse, 2005, aroideae, arnott, 1832, one, of, the, earliest, observations, of, species, in, the, araceae, was, conducted, by, theophrastus, in, his, work, enquiry, into, plants, the, araceae, were, not, recognized, as, a, distinct, group, of, plants, until, the, 16th, century, in, 1789, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, classified, all, climbing, aroids, as, pothos, and, all, terrestrial, aroids, as, either, arum, or, dracontium, in, his, book, familles, des, plantes, the, first, major, system, of, classification, for, the, family, was, produced, by, heinrich, wilhelm, schott, who, published, genera, aroidearum, in, 1858, and, prodromus, systematis, aroidearum, in, 1860, schott, s, system, was, based, on, floral, characteristics, and, used, a, narrow, conception, of, a, genus, adolf, engler, produced, a, classification, in, 1876, which, was, steadily, refined, up, to, 1920, his, system, is, significantly, different, from, schott, s, being, based, more, on, vegetative, characters, and, anatomy, the, two, systems, were, to, some, extent, rivals, with, engler, s, having, more, adherents, before, the, advent, of, molecular, phylogenetics, brought, new, approaches, a, comprehensive, taxonomy, of, araceae, was, published, by, mayo, et, al, in, 1997, modern, studies, based, on, gene, sequences, show, the, araceae, including, the, lemnoideae, duckweeds, to, be, monophyletic, and, the, first, diverging, group, within, the, alismatales, the, apg, iii, system, of, 2009, recognizes, the, family, including, the, genera, formerly, segregated, in, the, lemnaceae, the, sinking, of, the, lemnaceae, into, the, araceae, was, not, immediately, universally, accepted, for, example, the, 2010, new, flora, of, the, british, isles, used, a, paraphyletic, araceae, and, a, separate, lemnaceae, however, lemna, and, its, allies, were, incorporated, in, araceae, in, the, 2019, edition, 872, a, comprehensive, genomic, study, of, spirodela, polyrhiza, was, published, in, february, 2014, 143, genera, are, accepted, within, the, araceae, anthurium, epipremnum, monstera, philodendron, and, zantedeschia, are, some, of, the, most, well, known, genera, of, the, family, as, are, the, colocasia, taro, arbi, and, xanthosoma, elephant, ear, ape, which, are, both, cultivated, for, human, consumption, the, largest, unbranched, inflorescence, in, the, world, is, that, of, the, arum, amorphophallus, titanum, titan, arum, the, araceae, includes, many, ornamental, genera, of, global, economic, importance, aglaonema, alocasia, anthurium, caladium, dieffenbachia, epipremnum, homalomena, monstera, nephthytis, rhaphidophora, scindapsus, spathiphyllum, syngonium, and, zamioculcas, to, name, but, a, few, the, aquatic, genera, anubias, bucephalandra, and, cryptocoryne, are, highly, prized, and, cultivated, aquarium, plants, other, recently, described, genera, such, as, the, lagenandra, of, india, are, gradually, becoming, more, known, in, the, aquascaping, world, philodendron, is, an, important, genus, in, the, ecosystems, of, neotropical, rainforests, and, is, widely, used, in, home, and, interior, decorating, symplocarpus, foetidus, skunk, cabbage, is, a, common, eastern, north, american, species, an, interesting, peculiarity, is, that, this, family, includes, the, largest, unbranched, inflorescence, that, of, the, titan, arum, often, erroneously, called, the, largest, flower, and, the, smallest, flowering, plant, and, smallest, fruit, in, the, duckweed, wolffia, the, family, araceae, has, one, of, the, oldest, fossil, record, among, angiosperms, with, fossil, forms, first, appearing, during, the, early, cretaceous, epoch, notable, fossils, from, the, early, cretaceous, include, spixiarum, kipea, an, aroid, from, the, late, aptian, of, brazil, orontiophyllum, ferreri, an, aroid, leaf, from, the, late, albian, of, spain, and, turolospadix, bogneri, an, aroid, spadix, from, the, late, albian, of, spain, food, plants, in, the, family, araceae, include, amorphophallus, paeoniifolius, elephant, foot, yam, colocasia, esculenta, kochu, taro, dasheen, xanthosoma, cocoyam, tannia, typhonium, trilobatum, and, monstera, deliciosa, mexican, breadfruit, while, the, aroids, are, little, traded, and, overlooked, by, plant, breeders, to, the, extent, that, the, crop, trust, calls, them, orphan, crops, they, are, widely, grown, and, are, important, in, subsistence, agriculture, and, in, local, markets, the, main, food, product, is, the, corm, which, is, high, in, starch, leaves, and, flowers, also, find, culinary, use
