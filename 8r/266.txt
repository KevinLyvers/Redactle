programmed, cell, death, pcd, sometimes, referred, to, as, cellular, suicide, is, the, death, of, a, cell, as, a, result, of, events, inside, of, a, cell, such, as, apoptosis, or, autophagy, pcd, is, carried, out, in, a, biological, process, which, usually, confers, advantage, during, an, organism, s, lifecycle, for, example, the, differentiation, of, fingers, and, toes, in, a, developing, human, embryo, occurs, because, cells, between, the, fingers, apoptose, the, result, is, that, the, digits, are, separate, pcd, serves, fundamental, functions, during, both, plant, and, animal, tissue, development, apoptosis, and, autophagy, are, both, forms, of, programmed, cell, death, necrosis, is, the, death, of, a, cell, caused, by, external, factors, such, as, trauma, or, infection, and, occurs, in, several, different, forms, necrosis, was, long, seen, as, a, non, physiological, process, that, occurs, as, a, result, of, infection, or, injury, but, in, the, 2000s, a, form, of, programmed, necrosis, called, necroptosis, was, recognized, as, an, alternative, form, of, programmed, cell, death, it, is, hypothesized, that, necroptosis, can, serve, as, a, cell, death, backup, to, apoptosis, when, the, apoptosis, signaling, is, blocked, by, endogenous, or, exogenous, factors, such, as, viruses, or, mutations, most, recently, other, types, of, regulated, necrosis, have, been, discovered, as, well, which, share, several, signaling, events, with, necroptosis, and, apoptosis, the, concept, of, programmed, cell, death, was, used, by, lockshin, williams, in, 1964, in, relation, to, insect, tissue, development, around, eight, years, before, apoptosis, was, coined, the, term, pcd, has, however, been, a, source, of, confusion, and, durand, and, ramsey, have, developed, the, concept, by, providing, mechanistic, and, evolutionary, definitions, pcd, has, become, the, general, terms, that, refers, to, all, the, different, types, of, cell, death, that, have, a, genetic, component, the, first, insight, into, the, mechanism, came, from, studying, bcl2, the, product, of, a, putative, oncogene, activated, by, chromosome, translocations, often, found, in, follicular, lymphoma, unlike, other, cancer, genes, which, promote, cancer, by, stimulating, cell, proliferation, bcl2, promoted, cancer, by, stopping, lymphoma, cells, from, being, able, to, kill, themselves, pcd, has, been, the, subject, of, increasing, attention, and, research, efforts, this, trend, has, been, highlighted, with, the, award, of, the, 2002, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, to, sydney, brenner, united, kingdom, h, robert, horvitz, us, and, john, e, sulston, uk, apoptosis, is, the, process, of, programmed, cell, death, pcd, that, may, occur, in, multicellular, organisms, biochemical, events, lead, to, characteristic, cell, changes, morphology, and, death, these, changes, include, blebbing, cell, shrinkage, nuclear, fragmentation, chromatin, condensation, and, chromosomal, dna, fragmentation, it, is, now, thought, that, in, a, developmental, context, cells, are, induced, to, positively, commit, suicide, whilst, in, a, homeostatic, context, the, absence, of, certain, survival, factors, may, provide, the, impetus, for, suicide, there, appears, to, be, some, variation, in, the, morphology, and, indeed, the, biochemistry, of, these, suicide, pathways, some, treading, the, path, of, apoptosis, others, following, a, more, generalized, pathway, to, deletion, but, both, usually, being, genetically, and, synthetically, motivated, there, is, some, evidence, that, certain, symptoms, of, apoptosis, such, as, endonuclease, activation, can, be, spuriously, induced, without, engaging, a, genetic, cascade, however, presumably, true, apoptosis, and, programmed, cell, death, must, be, genetically, mediated, it, is, also, becoming, clear, that, mitosis, and, apoptosis, are, toggled, or, linked, in, some, way, and, that, the, balance, achieved, depends, on, signals, received, from, appropriate, growth, or, survival, factors, there, are, two, different, potential, pathways, that, may, be, followed, when, apoptosis, is, needed, there, is, the, extrinsic, pathway, and, the, intrinsic, pathway, both, pathways, involve, the, use, of, caspases, crucial, to, cell, death, the, extrinsic, pathway, involves, specific, receptor, ligand, interaction, either, the, fas, ligand, binds, to, the, fas, receptor, or, the, tnf, alpha, ligand, can, bind, to, the, tnf, receptor, in, both, situations, there, is, the, activation, of, initiator, caspase, the, extrinsic, pathway, can, be, activated, in, two, ways, the, first, way, is, through, fast, ligan, tnf, alpha, binding, or, through, a, cytotoxic, t, cell, the, cytotoxic, t, cell, can, attach, itself, to, a, membrane, facilitating, the, release, of, granzyme, b, granzyme, b, perforates, the, target, cell, membrane, and, in, turn, allows, the, release, of, perforin, finally, perforin, creates, a, pore, in, the, membrane, and, releases, the, caspases, which, leads, to, the, activation, of, caspase, 3, this, initiator, caspase, may, cause, the, cleaving, of, inactive, caspase, 3, causing, it, to, become, cleaved, caspase, 3, this, is, the, final, molecule, needed, to, trigger, cell, death, the, intrinsic, pathway, is, caused, by, cell, damage, such, as, dna, damage, or, uv, exposure, this, pathway, takes, place, in, the, mitochondria, and, is, mediated, by, sensors, called, bcl, sensors, and, two, proteins, called, bax, and, bak, these, proteins, are, found, in, a, majority, of, higher, mammals, as, they, are, able, to, pierce, the, mitochondrial, outer, membrane, making, them, an, integral, part, of, mediating, cell, death, by, apoptosis, they, do, this, by, orchestrating, the, formation, of, pores, within, the, membrane, essential, to, the, release, of, cytochrome, c, however, cytochrome, c, is, only, released, if, the, mitochondrial, membrane, is, compromised, once, cytochrome, c, is, detected, the, apoptosome, complex, is, formed, this, complex, activates, the, executioner, caspase, which, causes, cell, death, this, killing, of, the, cells, may, be, essential, as, it, prevents, cellular, overgrowth, which, can, result, in, disease, such, as, cancer, there, are, another, two, proteins, worth, mentioning, that, inhibit, the, release, of, cytochrome, c, in, the, mitochondria, bcl, 2, and, bcl, xl, are, anti, apoptotic, and, therefore, prevent, cell, death, there, is, a, potential, mutation, that, can, occur, in, that, causes, the, overactivity, of, bcl, 2, it, is, the, translocation, between, chromosomes, 14, and, 18, this, over, activity, can, result, in, the, development, of, follicular, lymphoma, macroautophagy, often, referred, to, as, autophagy, is, a, catabolic, process, that, results, in, the, autophagosomic, lysosomal, degradation, of, bulk, cytoplasmic, contents, abnormal, protein, aggregates, and, excess, or, damaged, organelles, autophagy, is, generally, activated, by, conditions, of, nutrient, deprivation, but, has, also, been, associated, with, physiological, as, well, as, pathological, processes, such, as, development, differentiation, neurodegenerative, diseases, stress, infection, and, cancer, a, critical, regulator, of, autophagy, induction, is, the, kinase, mtor, which, when, activated, suppresses, autophagy, and, when, not, activated, promotes, it, three, related, serine, threonine, kinases, unc, 51, like, kinase, 1, 2, and, 3, ulk1, ulk2, ukl3, which, play, a, similar, role, as, the, yeast, atg1, act, downstream, of, the, mtor, complex, ulk1, and, ulk2, form, a, large, complex, with, the, mammalian, homolog, of, an, autophagy, related, atg, gene, product, matg13, and, the, scaffold, protein, fip200, class, iii, pi3k, complex, containing, hvps34, beclin, 1, p150, and, atg14, like, protein, or, ultraviolet, irradiation, resistance, associated, gene, uvrag, is, required, for, the, induction, of, autophagy, the, atg, genes, control, the, autophagosome, formation, through, atg12, atg5, and, lc3, ii, atg8, ii, complexes, atg12, is, conjugated, to, atg5, in, a, ubiquitin, like, reaction, that, requires, atg7, and, atg10, the, atg12, atg5, conjugate, then, interacts, non, covalently, with, atg16, to, form, a, large, complex, lc3, atg8, is, cleaved, at, its, c, terminus, by, atg4, protease, to, generate, the, cytosolic, lc3, i, lc3, i, is, conjugated, to, phosphatidylethanolamine, pe, also, in, a, ubiquitin, like, reaction, that, requires, atg7, and, atg3, the, lipidated, form, of, lc3, known, as, lc3, ii, is, attached, to, the, autophagosome, membrane, autophagy, and, apoptosis, are, connected, both, positively, and, negatively, and, extensive, crosstalk, exists, between, the, two, during, nutrient, deficiency, autophagy, functions, as, a, pro, survival, mechanism, however, excessive, autophagy, may, lead, to, cell, death, a, process, morphologically, distinct, from, apoptosis, several, pro, apoptotic, signals, such, as, tnf, trail, and, fadd, also, induce, autophagy, additionally, bcl, 2, inhibits, beclin, 1, dependent, autophagy, thereby, functioning, both, as, a, pro, survival, and, as, an, anti, autophagic, regulator, besides, the, above, two, types, of, pcd, other, pathways, have, been, discovered, called, non, apoptotic, programmed, cell, death, or, caspase, independent, programmed, cell, death, or, necroptosis, these, alternative, routes, to, death, are, as, efficient, as, apoptosis, and, can, function, as, either, backup, mechanisms, or, the, main, type, of, pcd, other, forms, of, programmed, cell, death, include, anoikis, almost, identical, to, apoptosis, except, in, its, induction, cornification, a, form, of, cell, death, exclusive, to, the, epidermis, excitotoxicity, ferroptosis, an, iron, dependent, form, of, cell, death, and, wallerian, degeneration, necroptosis, is, a, programmed, form, of, necrosis, or, inflammatory, cell, death, conventionally, necrosis, is, associated, with, unprogrammed, cell, death, resulting, from, cellular, damage, or, infiltration, by, pathogens, in, contrast, to, orderly, programmed, cell, death, via, apoptosis, nemosis, is, another, programmed, form, of, necrosis, that, takes, place, in, fibroblasts, eryptosis, is, a, form, of, suicidal, erythrocyte, death, aponecrosis, is, a, hybrid, of, apoptosis, and, necrosis, and, refers, to, an, incomplete, apoptotic, process, that, is, completed, by, necrosis, netosis, is, the, process, of, cell, death, generated, by, nets, paraptosis, is, another, type, of, nonapoptotic, cell, death, that, is, mediated, by, mapk, through, the, activation, of, igf, 1, it, s, characterized, by, the, intracellular, formation, of, vacuoles, and, swelling, of, mitochondria, pyroptosis, an, inflammatory, type, of, cell, death, is, uniquely, mediated, by, caspase, 1, an, enzyme, not, involved, in, apoptosis, in, response, to, infection, by, certain, microorganisms, plant, cells, undergo, particular, processes, of, pcd, similar, to, autophagic, cell, death, however, some, common, features, of, pcd, are, highly, conserved, in, both, plants, and, metazoa, an, atrophic, factor, is, a, force, that, causes, a, cell, to, die, only, natural, forces, on, the, cell, are, considered, to, be, atrophic, factors, whereas, for, example, agents, of, mechanical, or, chemical, abuse, or, lysis, of, the, cell, are, considered, not, to, be, atrophic, factors, common, types, of, atrophic, factors, are, the, initial, expansion, of, the, developing, nervous, system, is, counterbalanced, by, the, removal, of, neurons, and, their, processes, during, the, development, of, the, nervous, system, almost, 50, of, developing, neurons, are, naturally, removed, by, programmed, cell, death, pcd, pcd, in, the, nervous, system, was, first, recognized, in, 1896, by, john, beard, since, then, several, theories, were, proposed, to, understand, its, biological, significance, during, neural, development, pcd, in, the, developing, nervous, system, has, been, observed, in, proliferating, as, well, as, post, mitotic, cells, one, theory, suggests, that, pcd, is, an, adaptive, mechanism, to, regulate, the, number, of, progenitor, cells, in, humans, pcd, in, progenitor, cells, starts, at, gestational, week, 7, and, remains, until, the, first, trimester, this, process, of, cell, death, has, been, identified, in, the, germinal, areas, of, the, cerebral, cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, and, spinal, cord, among, other, regions, at, gestational, weeks, 19, 23, pcd, is, observed, in, post, mitotic, cells, the, prevailing, theory, explaining, this, observation, is, the, neurotrophic, theory, which, states, that, pcd, is, required, to, optimize, the, connection, between, neurons, and, their, afferent, inputs, and, efferent, targets, another, theory, proposes, that, developmental, pcd, in, the, nervous, system, occurs, in, order, to, correct, for, errors, in, neurons, that, have, migrated, ectopically, innervated, incorrect, targets, or, have, axons, that, have, gone, awry, during, path, finding, it, is, possible, that, pcd, during, the, development, of, the, nervous, system, serves, different, functions, determined, by, the, developmental, stage, cell, type, and, even, species, the, neurotrophic, theory, is, the, leading, hypothesis, used, to, explain, the, role, of, programmed, cell, death, in, the, developing, nervous, system, it, postulates, that, in, order, to, ensure, optimal, innervation, of, targets, a, surplus, of, neurons, is, first, produced, which, then, compete, for, limited, quantities, of, protective, neurotrophic, factors, and, only, a, fraction, survive, while, others, die, by, programmed, cell, death, furthermore, the, theory, states, that, predetermined, factors, regulate, the, amount, of, neurons, that, survive, and, the, size, of, the, innervating, neuronal, population, directly, correlates, to, the, influence, of, their, target, field, the, underlying, idea, that, target, cells, secrete, attractive, or, inducing, factors, and, that, their, growth, cones, have, a, chemotactic, sensitivity, was, first, put, forth, by, santiago, ramon, y, cajal, in, 1892, cajal, presented, the, idea, as, an, explanation, for, the, intelligent, force, axons, appear, to, take, when, finding, their, target, but, admitted, that, he, had, no, empirical, data, the, theory, gained, more, attraction, when, experimental, manipulation, of, axon, targets, yielded, death, of, all, innervating, neurons, this, developed, the, concept, of, target, derived, regulation, which, became, the, main, tenet, in, the, neurotrophic, theory, experiments, that, further, supported, this, theory, led, to, the, identification, of, the, first, neurotrophic, factor, nerve, growth, factor, ngf, different, mechanisms, regulate, pcd, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, pns, versus, the, central, nervous, system, cns, in, the, pns, innervation, of, the, target, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, the, target, released, neurotrophic, factors, ngf, and, nt3, expression, of, neurotrophin, receptors, trka, and, trkc, is, sufficient, to, induce, apoptosis, in, the, absence, of, their, ligands, therefore, it, is, speculated, that, pcd, in, the, pns, is, dependent, on, the, release, of, neurotrophic, factors, and, thus, follows, the, concept, of, the, neurotrophic, theory, programmed, cell, death, in, the, cns, is, not, dependent, on, external, growth, factors, but, instead, relies, on, intrinsically, derived, cues, in, the, neocortex, a, 4, 1, ratio, of, excitatory, to, inhibitory, interneurons, is, maintained, by, apoptotic, machinery, that, appears, to, be, independent, of, the, environment, supporting, evidence, came, from, an, experiment, where, interneuron, progenitors, were, either, transplanted, into, the, mouse, neocortex, or, cultured, in, vitro, transplanted, cells, died, at, the, age, of, two, weeks, the, same, age, at, which, endogenous, interneurons, undergo, apoptosis, regardless, of, the, size, of, the, transplant, the, fraction, of, cells, undergoing, apoptosis, remained, constant, furthermore, disruption, of, trkb, a, receptor, for, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, did, not, affect, cell, death, it, has, also, been, shown, that, in, mice, null, for, the, proapoptotic, factor, bax, bcl, 2, associated, x, protein, a, larger, percentage, of, interneurons, survived, compared, to, wild, type, mice, together, these, findings, indicate, that, programmed, cell, death, in, the, cns, partly, exploits, bax, mediated, signaling, and, is, independent, of, bdnf, and, the, environment, apoptotic, mechanisms, in, the, cns, are, still, not, well, understood, yet, it, is, thought, that, apoptosis, of, interneurons, is, a, self, autonomous, process, programmed, cell, death, can, be, reduced, or, eliminated, in, the, developing, nervous, system, by, the, targeted, deletion, of, pro, apoptotic, genes, or, by, the, overexpression, of, anti, apoptotic, genes, the, absence, or, reduction, of, pcd, can, cause, serious, anatomical, malformations, but, can, also, result, in, minimal, consequences, depending, on, the, gene, targeted, neuronal, population, and, stage, of, development, excess, progenitor, cell, proliferation, that, leads, to, gross, brain, abnormalities, is, often, lethal, as, seen, in, caspase, 3, or, caspase, 9, knockout, mice, which, develop, exencephaly, in, the, forebrain, the, brainstem, spinal, cord, and, peripheral, ganglia, of, these, mice, develop, normally, however, suggesting, that, the, involvement, of, caspases, in, pcd, during, development, depends, on, the, brain, region, and, cell, type, knockout, or, inhibition, of, apoptotic, protease, activating, factor, 1, apaf1, also, results, in, malformations, and, increased, embryonic, lethality, manipulation, of, apoptosis, regulator, proteins, bcl, 2, and, bax, overexpression, of, bcl, 2, or, deletion, of, bax, produces, an, increase, in, the, number, of, neurons, in, certain, regions, of, the, nervous, system, such, as, the, retina, trigeminal, nucleus, cerebellum, and, spinal, cord, however, pcd, of, neurons, due, to, bax, deletion, or, bcl, 2, overexpression, does, not, result, in, prominent, morphological, or, behavioral, abnormalities, in, mice, for, example, mice, overexpressing, bcl, 2, have, generally, normal, motor, skills, and, vision, and, only, show, impairment, in, complex, behaviors, such, as, learning, and, anxiety, the, normal, behavioral, phenotypes, of, these, mice, suggest, that, an, adaptive, mechanism, may, be, involved, to, compensate, for, the, excess, neurons, learning, about, pcd, in, various, species, is, essential, in, understanding, the, evolutionary, basis, and, reason, for, apoptosis, in, development, of, the, nervous, system, during, the, development, of, the, invertebrate, nervous, system, pcd, plays, different, roles, in, different, species, the, similarity, of, the, asymmetric, cell, death, mechanism, in, the, nematode, and, the, leech, indicates, that, pcd, may, have, an, evolutionary, significance, in, the, development, of, the, nervous, system, in, the, nematode, pcd, occurs, in, the, first, hour, of, development, leading, to, the, elimination, of, 12, of, non, gonadal, cells, including, neuronal, lineages, cell, death, in, arthropods, occurs, first, in, the, nervous, system, when, ectoderm, cells, differentiate, and, one, daughter, cell, becomes, a, neuroblast, and, the, other, undergoes, apoptosis, furthermore, sex, targeted, cell, death, leads, to, different, neuronal, innervation, of, specific, organs, in, males, and, females, in, drosophila, pcd, is, essential, in, segmentation, and, specification, during, development, in, contrast, to, invertebrates, the, mechanism, of, programmed, cell, death, is, found, to, be, more, conserved, in, vertebrates, extensive, studies, performed, on, various, vertebrates, show, that, pcd, of, neurons, and, glia, occurs, in, most, parts, of, the, nervous, system, during, development, it, has, been, observed, before, and, during, synaptogenesis, in, the, central, nervous, system, as, well, as, the, peripheral, nervous, system, however, there, are, a, few, differences, between, vertebrate, species, for, example, mammals, exhibit, extensive, arborization, followed, by, pcd, in, the, retina, while, birds, do, not, although, synaptic, refinement, in, vertebrate, systems, is, largely, dependent, on, pcd, other, evolutionary, mechanisms, also, play, a, role, programmed, cell, death, in, plants, has, a, number, of, molecular, similarities, to, animal, apoptosis, but, it, also, has, differences, the, most, obvious, being, the, presence, of, a, cell, wall, and, the, lack, of, an, immune, system, that, removes, the, pieces, of, the, dead, cell, instead, of, an, immune, response, the, dying, cell, synthesizes, substances, to, break, itself, down, and, places, them, in, a, vacuole, that, ruptures, as, the, cell, dies, in, apl, regulates, vascular, tissue, identity, in, arabidopsis, martin, bonke, and, his, colleagues, had, stated, that, one, of, the, two, long, distance, transport, systems, in, vascular, plants, xylem, consists, of, several, cell, types, the, differentiation, of, which, involves, deposition, of, elaborate, cell, wall, thickenings, and, programmed, cell, death, the, authors, emphasize, that, the, products, of, plant, pcd, play, an, important, structural, role, basic, morphological, and, biochemical, features, of, pcd, have, been, conserved, in, both, plant, and, animal, kingdoms, specific, types, of, plant, cells, carry, out, unique, cell, death, programs, these, have, common, features, with, animal, apoptosis, for, instance, nuclear, dna, degradation, but, they, also, have, their, own, peculiarities, such, as, nuclear, degradation, triggered, by, the, collapse, of, the, vacuole, in, tracheary, elements, of, the, xylem, janneke, balk, and, christopher, j, leaver, of, the, department, of, plant, sciences, university, of, oxford, carried, out, research, on, mutations, in, the, mitochondrial, genome, of, sun, flower, cells, results, of, this, research, suggest, that, mitochondria, play, the, same, key, role, in, vascular, plant, pcd, as, in, other, eukaryotic, cells, during, pollination, plants, enforce, self, incompatibility, si, as, an, important, means, to, prevent, self, fertilization, research, on, the, corn, poppy, papaver, rhoeas, has, revealed, that, proteins, in, the, pistil, on, which, the, pollen, lands, interact, with, pollen, and, trigger, pcd, in, incompatible, i, e, self, pollen, the, researchers, steven, g, thomas, and, vernonica, e, franklin, tong, also, found, that, the, response, involves, rapid, inhibition, of, pollen, tube, growth, followed, by, pcd, the, social, slime, mold, dictyostelium, discoideum, has, the, peculiarity, of, either, adopting, a, predatory, amoeba, like, behavior, in, its, unicellular, form, or, coalescing, into, a, mobile, slug, like, form, when, dispersing, the, spores, that, will, give, birth, to, the, next, generation, the, stalk, is, composed, of, dead, cells, that, have, undergone, a, type, of, pcd, that, shares, many, features, of, an, autophagic, cell, death, massive, vacuoles, forming, inside, cells, a, degree, of, chromatin, condensation, but, no, dna, fragmentation, the, structural, role, of, the, residues, left, by, the, dead, cells, is, reminiscent, of, the, products, of, pcd, in, plant, tissue, d, discoideum, is, a, slime, mold, part, of, a, branch, that, might, have, emerged, from, eukaryotic, ancestors, about, a, billion, years, before, the, present, it, seems, that, they, emerged, after, the, ancestors, of, green, plants, and, the, ancestors, of, fungi, and, animals, had, differentiated, but, in, addition, to, their, place, in, the, evolutionary, tree, the, fact, that, pcd, has, been, observed, in, the, humble, simple, six, chromosome, d, discoideum, has, additional, significance, it, permits, the, study, of, a, developmental, pcd, path, that, does, not, depend, on, caspases, characteristic, of, apoptosis, the, occurrence, of, programmed, cell, death, in, protists, is, possible, but, it, remains, controversial, some, categorize, death, in, those, organisms, as, unregulated, apoptosis, like, cell, death, biologists, had, long, suspected, that, mitochondria, originated, from, bacteria, that, had, been, incorporated, as, endosymbionts, living, together, inside, of, larger, eukaryotic, cells, it, was, lynn, margulis, who, from, 1967, on, championed, this, theory, which, has, since, become, widely, accepted, the, most, convincing, evidence, for, this, theory, is, the, fact, that, mitochondria, possess, their, own, dna, and, are, equipped, with, genes, and, replication, apparatus, this, evolutionary, step, would, have, been, risky, for, the, primitive, eukaryotic, cells, which, began, to, engulf, the, energy, producing, bacteria, as, well, as, a, perilous, step, for, the, ancestors, of, mitochondria, which, began, to, invade, their, proto, eukaryotic, hosts, this, process, is, still, evident, today, between, human, white, blood, cells, and, bacteria, most, of, the, time, invading, bacteria, are, destroyed, by, the, white, blood, cells, however, it, is, not, uncommon, for, the, chemical, warfare, waged, by, prokaryotes, to, succeed, with, the, consequence, known, as, infection, by, its, resulting, damage, one, of, these, rare, evolutionary, events, about, two, billion, years, before, the, present, made, it, possible, for, certain, eukaryotes, and, energy, producing, prokaryotes, to, coexist, and, mutually, benefit, from, their, symbiosis, mitochondriate, eukaryotic, cells, live, poised, between, life, and, death, because, mitochondria, still, retain, their, repertoire, of, molecules, that, can, trigger, cell, suicide, it, is, not, clear, why, apoptotic, machinery, is, maintained, in, the, extant, unicellular, organisms, this, process, has, now, been, evolved, to, happen, only, when, programmed, to, cells, such, as, feedback, from, neighbors, stress, or, dna, damage, mitochondria, release, caspase, activators, that, trigger, the, cell, death, inducing, biochemical, cascade, as, such, the, cell, suicide, mechanism, is, now, crucial, to, all, of, our, lives, repair, of, dna, damages, and, apoptosis, are, two, enzymatic, processes, essential, for, maintaining, genome, integrity, in, humans, cells, that, are, deficient, in, dna, repair, tend, to, accumulate, dna, damages, and, when, such, cells, are, also, defective, in, apoptosis, they, tend, to, survive, even, with, excess, dna, damage, replication, of, dna, in, such, cells, leads, to, mutations, and, these, mutations, may, cause, cancer, see, figure, several, enzymatic, pathways, have, evolved, for, repairing, different, kinds, of, dna, damage, and, it, has, been, found, that, in, five, well, studied, dna, repair, pathways, particular, enzymes, have, a, dual, role, where, one, role, is, to, participate, in, repair, of, a, specific, class, of, damages, and, the, second, role, is, to, induce, apoptosis, if, the, level, of, such, dna, damage, is, beyond, the, cell, s, repair, capability, these, dual, role, proteins, tend, to, protect, against, development, of, cancer, proteins, that, function, in, such, a, dual, role, for, each, repair, process, are, 1, dna, mismatch, repair, msh2, msh6, mlh1, and, pms2, 2, base, excision, repair, apex1, ref1, ape, poly, adp, ribose, polymerase, parp, 3, nucleotide, excision, repair, xpb, xpd, ercc2, p53, p33, ing1b, 4, non,
