erpetoichthys, polypterus, see, text, for, species, bichirs, b, r, z, and, the, reedfish, comprise, polypteridae, p, l, p, t, r, d, i, a, family, of, archaic, ray, finned, fishes, and, the, only, family, in, the, order, polypteriformes, p, l, p, t, r, f, r, m, i, z, all, the, species, occur, in, freshwater, habitats, in, tropical, africa, and, the, nile, river, system, mainly, swampy, shallow, floodplains, and, estuaries, cladistia, polypterids, and, their, fossil, relatives, are, considered, the, sister, group, to, all, other, extant, ray, finned, fishes, actinopteri, they, likely, diverged, from, actinopteri, at, least, 330, million, years, ago, a, closely, related, group, the, scanilepiformes, are, known, from, the, later, permian, to, the, triassic, and, are, likely, ancestral, to, polypterids, the, oldest, polypterids, are, around, 100, million, years, old, from, the, early, late, cretaceous, of, south, america, and, africa, polypterids, are, elongated, fish, with, a, unique, series, of, dorsal, finlets, which, vary, in, number, from, seven, to, 18, instead, of, a, single, dorsal, fin, each, of, the, dorsal, finlets, has, bifid, double, edged, tips, and, are, the, only, fins, with, spines, the, rest, of, the, fins, are, composed, of, soft, rays, the, body, is, covered, in, thick, bonelike, and, rhombic, ganoid, scales, their, jaw, structure, more, closely, resembles, that, of, the, tetrapods, than, that, of, the, teleost, fishes, bichirs, have, a, number, of, other, primitive, characteristics, including, fleshy, pectoral, fins, superficially, similar, to, those, of, lobe, finned, fishes, they, also, have, a, pair, of, slit, like, spiracles, on, the, top, of, their, heads, that, are, used, to, breathe, air, two, gular, plates, and, paired, ventral, lungs, both, lungs, are, unchambered, sacs, the, larger, right, lung, reaches, the, whole, length, of, the, body, cavity, while, the, smaller, left, lung, extends, to, the, stomach, a, slit, like, opening, called, the, glottis, located, on, the, ventral, side, of, the, oesophagus, leads, to, the, right, lung, and, a, separate, opening, on, the, right, lung, leads, to, the, left, lung, four, pairs, of, gill, arches, are, present, polypterids, have, a, maximum, body, length, ranging, from, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, to, over, 100, cm, 39, in, depending, on, specific, species, and, morphology, polypterids, are, nocturnal, and, feed, on, small, vertebrates, crustaceans, and, insects, their, common, aquarium, diet, includes, bloodworms, chironomidae, larvae, polypterids, are, known, to, have, extraordinary, olfactory, ability, polypterid, reproduction, consists, of, the, female, laying, anywhere, from, 100, to, 300, eggs, over, the, span, of, a, few, days, and, subsequent, fertilization, by, the, male, polypterids, possess, paired, lungs, which, connect, to, the, esophagus, via, a, glottis, they, are, facultative, air, breathers, accessing, surface, air, to, breathe, when, the, water, they, inhabit, is, poorly, oxygenated, their, lungs, are, highly, vascularized, to, facilitate, gas, exchange, deoxygenated, arterial, blood, is, brought, to, the, lungs, by, paired, pulmonary, arteries, which, branch, from, the, fourth, efferent, branchial, arteries, artery, from, the, fourth, gill, arch, and, oxygenated, blood, leaves, the, lungs, in, pulmonary, veins, unlike, most, lungfish, and, tetrapods, their, lungs, are, smooth, sacs, instead, of, alveolated, tissue, polypterids, are, unique, in, that, they, breathe, using, recoil, aspiration, polypterids, appear, to, prefer, breathing, air, via, their, spiracles, when, undisturbed, or, in, extremely, shallow, waters, where, they, are, unable, to, incline, their, body, enough, to, breathe, air, through, their, mouth, polypterids, are, popular, subjects, of, public, and, large, hobby, aquaria, they, are, sometimes, called, dragon, bichir, or, dragon, fin, in, pet, shops, for, a, more, appealing, name, due, to, their, dragon, like, appearance, though, predatory, they, are, otherwise, peaceful, preferring, to, lie, on, the, bottom, they, tend, to, swim, when, there, are, lots, of, large, plants, present, and, make, good, tankmates, with, other, species, large, enough, to, not, be, prey, but, small, enough, to, not, eat, them, some, aquarists, note, that, pleco, catfish, eat, the, slime, coat, off, of, polypterids, polypterids, in, captivity, have, life, expectancies, of, 10, 30, years, they, do, well, in, heavily, planted, tanks, as, it, mimics, their, natural, habitat, in, addition, to, the, extinct, genus, bawitius, the, two, living, genera, polypterus, and, erpetoichthys, have, 14, extant, species, erpetoichthys, calabaricus, p, retropinnis, p, congicus, p, ansorgii, p, endlicheri, p, bichir, p, mokelembembe, p, ornatipinnis, p, weeksii, p, teugelsi, p, palmas, p, senegalus, p, delhezi, p, polli, order, polypteriformes, suborder, polypterioidei, clade, salamandrophysida
