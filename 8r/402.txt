aphids, are, small, sap, sucking, insects, and, members, of, the, superfamily, aphidoidea, common, names, include, greenfly, and, blackfly, although, individuals, within, a, species, can, vary, widely, in, color, the, group, includes, the, fluffy, white, woolly, aphids, a, typical, life, cycle, involves, flightless, females, giving, live, birth, to, female, nymphs, who, may, also, be, already, pregnant, an, adaptation, scientists, call, telescoping, generations, without, the, involvement, of, males, maturing, rapidly, females, breed, profusely, so, that, the, number, of, these, insects, multiplies, quickly, winged, females, may, develop, later, in, the, season, allowing, the, insects, to, colonize, new, plants, in, temperate, regions, a, phase, of, sexual, reproduction, occurs, in, the, autumn, with, the, insects, often, overwintering, as, eggs, the, life, cycle, of, some, species, involves, an, alternation, between, two, species, of, host, plants, for, example, between, an, annual, crop, and, a, woody, plant, some, species, feed, on, only, one, type, of, plant, while, others, are, generalists, colonizing, many, plant, groups, about, 5, 000, species, of, aphid, have, been, described, all, included, in, the, family, aphididae, around, 400, of, these, are, found, on, food, and, fiber, crops, and, many, are, serious, pests, of, agriculture, and, forestry, as, well, as, an, annoyance, for, gardeners, so, called, dairying, ants, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, aphids, tending, them, for, their, honeydew, and, protecting, them, from, predators, aphids, are, among, the, most, destructive, insect, pests, on, cultivated, plants, in, temperate, regions, in, addition, to, weakening, the, plant, by, sucking, sap, they, act, as, vectors, for, plant, viruses, and, disfigure, ornamental, plants, with, deposits, of, honeydew, and, the, subsequent, growth, of, sooty, moulds, because, of, their, ability, to, rapidly, increase, in, numbers, by, asexual, reproduction, and, telescopic, development, they, are, a, highly, successful, group, of, organisms, from, an, ecological, standpoint, large, scale, control, of, aphids, is, not, easy, insecticides, do, not, always, produce, reliable, results, because, resistance, to, several, classes, of, insecticide, and, because, aphids, often, feed, on, the, undersides, of, leaves, and, are, thus, shielded, on, a, small, scale, water, jets, and, soap, sprays, are, quite, effective, natural, enemies, include, predatory, ladybugs, hoverfly, larvae, parasitic, wasps, aphid, midge, larvae, crab, spiders, lacewing, larvae, and, entomopathogenic, fungi, an, integrated, pest, management, strategy, using, biological, pest, control, can, work, but, is, difficult, to, achieve, except, in, enclosed, environments, such, as, greenhouses, aphids, are, distributed, worldwide, but, are, most, common, in, temperate, zones, in, contrast, to, many, taxa, aphid, species, diversity, is, much, lower, in, the, tropics, than, in, the, temperate, zones, they, can, migrate, great, distances, mainly, through, passive, dispersal, by, winds, winged, aphids, may, also, rise, up, in, the, day, as, high, as, 600, m, where, they, are, transported, by, strong, winds, for, example, the, currant, lettuce, aphid, nasonovia, ribisnigri, is, believed, to, have, spread, from, new, zealand, to, tasmania, around, 2004, through, easterly, winds, aphids, have, also, been, spread, by, human, transportation, of, infested, plant, materials, making, some, species, nearly, cosmopolitan, in, their, distribution, aphids, and, the, closely, related, adelgids, and, phylloxerans, probably, evolved, from, a, common, ancestor, some, 280, million, years, ago, in, the, early, permian, period, they, probably, fed, on, plants, like, cordaitales, or, cycadophyta, with, their, soft, bodies, aphids, do, not, fossilize, well, and, the, oldest, known, fossil, is, of, the, species, triassoaphis, cubitus, from, the, triassic, they, do, however, sometimes, get, stuck, in, plant, exudates, which, solidify, into, amber, in, 1967, when, professor, ole, heie, wrote, his, monograph, studies, on, fossil, aphids, about, sixty, species, have, been, described, from, the, triassic, jurassic, cretaceous, and, mostly, the, tertiary, periods, with, baltic, amber, contributing, another, forty, species, the, total, number, of, species, was, small, but, increased, considerably, with, the, appearance, of, the, angiosperms, 160, million, years, ago, as, this, allowed, aphids, to, specialise, the, speciation, of, aphids, going, hand, in, hand, with, the, diversification, of, flowering, plants, the, earliest, aphids, were, probably, polyphagous, with, monophagy, developing, later, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, ancestors, of, the, adelgidae, lived, on, conifers, while, those, of, the, aphididae, fed, on, the, sap, of, podocarpaceae, or, araucariaceae, that, survived, extinctions, in, the, late, cretaceous, organs, like, the, cornicles, did, not, appear, until, the, cretaceous, period, one, study, alternatively, suggests, that, ancestral, aphids, may, have, lived, on, angiosperm, bark, and, that, feeding, on, leaves, may, be, a, derived, trait, the, lachninae, have, long, mouth, parts, that, are, suitable, for, living, on, bark, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, mid, cretaceous, ancestor, fed, on, the, bark, of, angiosperm, trees, switching, to, leaves, of, conifer, hosts, in, the, late, cretaceous, the, phylloxeridae, may, well, be, the, oldest, family, still, extant, but, their, fossil, record, is, limited, to, the, lower, miocene, palaeophylloxera, late, 20th, century, reclassification, within, the, hemiptera, reduced, the, old, taxon, homoptera, to, two, suborders, sternorrhyncha, aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids, etc, and, auchenorrhyncha, cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, etc, with, the, suborder, heteroptera, containing, a, large, group, of, insects, known, as, the, true, bugs, the, infraorder, aphidomorpha, within, the, sternorrhyncha, varies, with, circumscription, with, several, fossil, groups, being, especially, difficult, to, place, but, includes, the, adelgoidea, the, aphidoidea, and, the, phylloxeroidea, some, authors, use, a, single, superfamily, aphidoidea, within, which, the, phylloxeridae, and, adelgidae, are, also, included, while, others, have, aphidoidea, with, a, sister, superfamily, phylloxeroidea, within, which, the, adelgidae, and, phylloxeridae, are, placed, early, 21st, century, reclassifications, substantially, rearranged, the, families, within, aphidoidea, some, old, families, were, reduced, to, subfamily, rank, e, g, eriosomatidae, and, many, old, subfamilies, were, elevated, to, family, rank, the, most, recent, authoritative, classifications, have, three, superfamilies, adelgoidea, phylloxeroidea, and, aphidoidea, the, aphidoidea, includes, a, single, large, family, aphididae, that, includes, all, the, 5000, extant, species, aphids, adelgids, and, phylloxerids, are, very, closely, related, within, the, suborder, sternorrhyncha, the, plant, sucking, bugs, they, are, either, placed, in, the, insect, superfamily, aphidoidea, or, into, the, superfamily, phylloxeroidea, which, contains, the, family, adelgidae, and, the, family, phylloxeridae, like, aphids, phylloxera, feed, on, the, roots, leaves, and, shoots, of, grape, plants, but, unlike, aphids, do, not, produce, honeydew, or, cornicle, secretions, phylloxera, daktulosphaira, vitifoliae, are, insects, which, caused, the, great, french, wine, blight, that, devastated, european, viticulture, in, the, 19th, century, similarly, adelgids, or, woolly, conifer, aphids, also, feed, on, plant, phloem, and, are, sometimes, described, as, aphids, but, are, more, properly, classified, as, aphid, like, insects, because, they, have, no, cauda, or, cornicles, the, treatment, of, the, groups, especially, concerning, fossil, groups, varies, greatly, due, to, difficulties, in, resolving, relationships, most, modern, treatments, include, the, three, superfamilies, the, adelogidea, the, aphidoidea, and, the, phylloxeroidea, within, the, infraorder, aphidomorpha, along, with, several, fossil, groups, psylloidea, jumping, plant, lice, etc, aleyrodoidea, whiteflies, coccoidea, scale, insects, phylloxeridae, phylloxerans, adelgidae, woolly, conifer, aphids, aphididae, aphids, the, phylogenetic, tree, based, on, papasotiropoulos, 2013, and, kim, 2011, with, additions, from, ortiz, rivas, and, martinez, torres, 2009, shows, the, internal, phylogeny, of, the, aphididae, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, phylogeny, of, the, aphid, groups, might, be, revealed, by, examining, the, phylogeny, of, their, bacterial, endosymbionts, especially, the, obligate, endosymbiont, buchnera, the, results, depend, on, the, assumption, that, the, symbionts, are, strictly, transmitted, vertically, through, the, generations, this, assumption, is, well, supported, by, the, evidence, and, several, phylogenetic, relationships, have, been, suggested, on, the, basis, of, endosymbiont, studies, lachninae, hormaphidinae, calaphidinae, chaitophorinae, eriosomatinae, woolly, aphids, anoeciinae, capitophorus, pterocoma, macrosiphini, rhopalosiphina, aphidina, aphis, spp, most, aphids, have, soft, bodies, which, may, be, green, black, brown, pink, or, almost, colorless, aphids, have, antennae, with, two, short, broad, basal, segments, and, up, to, four, slender, terminal, segments, they, have, a, pair, of, compound, eyes, with, an, ocular, tubercle, behind, and, above, each, eye, made, up, of, three, lenses, called, triommatidia, they, feed, on, sap, using, sucking, mouthparts, called, stylets, enclosed, in, a, sheath, called, a, rostrum, which, is, formed, from, modifications, of, the, mandible, and, maxilla, of, the, insect, mouthparts, they, have, long, thin, legs, with, two, jointed, two, clawed, tarsi, the, majority, of, aphids, are, wingless, but, winged, forms, are, produced, at, certain, times, of, year, in, many, species, most, aphids, have, a, pair, of, cornicles, siphunculi, abdominal, tubes, on, the, dorsal, surface, of, their, fifth, abdominal, segment, through, which, they, exude, droplets, of, a, quick, hardening, defensive, fluid, containing, triacylglycerols, called, cornicle, wax, other, defensive, compounds, can, also, be, produced, by, some, species, aphids, have, a, tail, like, protrusion, called, a, cauda, above, their, rectal, apertures, they, have, lost, their, malpighian, tubules, when, host, plant, quality, becomes, poor, or, conditions, become, crowded, some, aphid, species, produce, winged, offspring, alates, that, can, disperse, to, other, food, sources, the, mouthparts, or, eyes, can, be, small, or, missing, in, some, species, and, forms, many, aphid, species, are, monophagous, that, is, they, feed, on, only, one, plant, species, others, like, the, green, peach, aphid, feed, on, hundreds, of, plant, species, across, many, families, about, 10, of, species, feed, on, different, plants, at, different, times, of, the, year, a, new, host, plant, is, chosen, by, a, winged, adult, by, using, visual, cues, followed, by, olfaction, using, the, antennae, if, the, plant, smells, right, the, next, action, is, probing, the, surface, upon, landing, the, stylus, is, inserted, and, saliva, secreted, the, sap, is, sampled, the, xylem, may, be, tasted, and, finally, the, phloem, is, tested, aphid, saliva, may, inhibit, phloem, sealing, mechanisms, and, has, pectinases, that, ease, penetration, non, host, plants, can, be, rejected, at, any, stage, of, the, probe, but, the, transfer, of, viruses, occurs, early, in, the, investigation, process, at, the, time, of, the, introduction, of, the, saliva, so, non, host, plants, can, become, infected, aphids, usually, feed, passively, on, sap, of, phloem, vessels, in, plants, as, do, many, of, other, hemipterans, such, as, scale, insects, and, cicadas, once, a, phloem, vessel, is, punctured, the, sap, which, is, under, pressure, is, forced, into, the, aphid, s, food, canal, occasionally, aphids, also, ingest, xylem, sap, which, is, a, more, dilute, diet, than, phloem, sap, as, the, concentrations, of, sugars, and, amino, acids, are, 1, of, those, in, the, phloem, xylem, sap, is, under, negative, hydrostatic, pressure, and, requires, active, sucking, suggesting, an, important, role, in, aphid, physiology, as, xylem, sap, ingestion, has, been, observed, following, a, dehydration, period, aphids, are, thought, to, consume, xylem, sap, to, replenish, their, water, balance, the, consumption, of, the, dilute, sap, of, xylem, permitting, aphids, to, rehydrate, however, recent, data, showed, aphids, consume, more, xylem, sap, than, expected, and, they, notably, do, so, when, they, are, not, dehydrated, and, when, their, fecundity, decreases, this, suggests, aphids, and, potentially, all, the, phloem, sap, feeding, species, of, the, order, hemiptera, consume, xylem, sap, for, reasons, other, than, replenishing, water, balance, although, aphids, passively, take, in, phloem, sap, which, is, under, pressure, they, can, also, draw, fluid, at, negative, or, atmospheric, pressure, using, the, cibarial, pharyngeal, pump, mechanism, present, in, their, head, xylem, sap, consumption, may, be, related, to, osmoregulation, high, osmotic, pressure, in, the, stomach, caused, by, high, sucrose, concentration, can, lead, to, water, transfer, from, the, hemolymph, to, the, stomach, thus, resulting, in, hyperosmotic, stress, and, eventually, to, the, death, of, the, insect, aphids, avoid, this, fate, by, osmoregulating, through, several, processes, sucrose, concentration, is, directly, reduced, by, assimilating, sucrose, toward, metabolism, and, by, synthesizing, oligosaccharides, from, several, sucrose, molecules, thus, reducing, the, solute, concentration, and, consequently, the, osmotic, pressure, oligosaccharides, are, then, excreted, through, honeydew, explaining, its, high, sugar, concentrations, which, can, then, be, used, by, other, animals, such, as, ants, furthermore, water, is, transferred, from, the, hindgut, where, osmotic, pressure, has, already, been, reduced, to, the, stomach, to, dilute, stomach, content, eventually, aphids, consume, xylem, sap, to, dilute, the, stomach, osmotic, pressure, all, these, processes, function, synergetically, and, enable, aphids, to, feed, on, high, sucrose, concentration, plant, sap, as, well, as, to, adapt, to, varying, sucrose, concentrations, plant, sap, is, an, unbalanced, diet, for, aphids, as, it, lacks, essential, amino, acids, which, aphids, like, all, animals, cannot, synthesise, and, possesses, a, high, osmotic, pressure, due, to, its, high, sucrose, concentration, essential, amino, acids, are, provided, to, aphids, by, bacterial, endosymbionts, harboured, in, special, cells, bacteriocytes, these, symbionts, recycle, glutamate, a, metabolic, waste, of, their, host, into, essential, amino, acids, some, species, of, aphids, have, acquired, the, ability, to, synthesise, red, carotenoids, by, horizontal, gene, transfer, from, fungi, they, are, the, only, animals, other, than, two, spotted, spider, mites, and, the, oriental, hornet, with, this, capability, using, their, carotenoids, aphids, may, well, be, able, to, absorb, solar, energy, and, convert, it, to, a, form, that, their, cells, can, use, atp, this, is, the, only, known, example, of, photoheterotrophy, in, animals, the, carotene, pigments, in, aphids, form, a, layer, close, to, the, surface, of, the, cuticle, ideally, placed, to, absorb, sunlight, the, excited, carotenoids, seem, to, reduce, nad, to, nadh, which, is, oxidized, in, the, mitochondria, for, energy, the, simplest, reproductive, strategy, is, for, an, aphid, to, have, a, single, host, all, year, round, on, this, it, may, alternate, between, sexual, and, asexual, generations, holocyclic, or, alternatively, all, young, may, be, produced, by, parthenogenesis, eggs, never, being, laid, anholocyclic, some, species, can, have, both, holocyclic, and, anholocyclic, populations, under, different, circumstances, but, no, known, aphid, species, reproduce, solely, by, sexual, means, the, alternation, of, sexual, and, asexual, generations, may, have, evolved, repeatedly, however, aphid, reproduction, is, often, more, complex, than, this, and, involves, migration, between, different, host, plants, in, about, 10, of, species, there, is, an, alternation, between, woody, primary, hosts, on, which, the, aphids, overwinter, and, herbaceous, secondary, host, plants, where, they, reproduce, abundantly, in, the, summer, a, few, species, can, produce, a, soldier, caste, other, species, show, extensive, polyphenism, under, different, environmental, conditions, and, some, can, control, the, sex, ratio, of, their, offspring, depending, on, external, factors, when, a, typical, sophisticated, reproductive, strategy, is, used, only, females, are, present, in, the, population, at, the, beginning, of, the, seasonal, cycle, although, a, few, species, of, aphids, have, been, found, to, have, both, male, and, female, sexes, at, this, time, the, overwintering, eggs, that, hatch, in, the, spring, result, in, females, called, fundatrices, stem, mothers, reproduction, typically, does, not, involve, males, parthenogenesis, and, results, in, a, live, birth, viviparity, the, live, young, are, produced, by, pseudoplacental, viviparity, which, is, the, development, of, eggs, deficient, in, the, yolk, the, embryos, fed, by, a, tissue, acting, as, a, placenta, the, young, emerge, from, the, mother, soon, after, hatching, eggs, are, parthenogenetically, produced, without, meiosis, and, the, offspring, are, clonal, to, their, mother, so, they, are, all, female, thelytoky, the, embryos, develop, within, the, mothers, ovarioles, which, then, give, birth, to, live, already, hatched, first, instar, female, nymphs, as, the, eggs, begin, to, develop, immediately, after, ovulation, an, adult, female, can, house, developing, female, nymphs, which, already, have, parthenogenetically, developing, embryos, inside, them, i, e, they, are, born, pregnant, this, telescoping, of, generations, enables, aphids, to, increase, in, number, with, great, rapidity, the, offspring, resemble, their, parent, in, every, way, except, size, thus, a, female, s, diet, can, affect, the, body, size, and, birth, rate, of, more, than, two, generations, daughters, and, granddaughters, this, process, repeats, itself, throughout, the, summer, producing, multiple, generations, that, typically, live, 20, to, 40, days, for, example, some, species, of, cabbage, aphids, like, brevicoryne, brassicae, can, produce, up, to, 41, generations, of, females, in, a, season, thus, one, female, hatched, in, spring, can, theoretically, produce, billions, of, descendants, were, they, all, to, survive, in, autumn, aphids, reproduce, sexually, and, lay, eggs, environmental, factors, such, as, a, change, in, photoperiod, and, temperature, or, perhaps, a, lower, food, quantity, or, quality, causes, females, to, parthenogenetically, produce, sexual, females, and, males, the, males, are, genetically, identical, to, their, mothers, except, that, with, the, aphids, x0, sex, determination, system, they, have, one, fewer, sex, chromosome, these, sexual, aphids, may, lack, wings, or, even, mouthparts, sexual, females, and, males, mate, and, females, lay, eggs, that, develop, outside, the, mother, the, eggs, survive, the, winter, and, hatch, into, winged, alate, or, wingless, females, the, following, spring, this, occurs, in, for, example, the, life, cycle, of, the, rose, aphid, macrosiphum, rosae, which, may, be, considered, typical, of, the, family, however, in, warm, environments, such, as, in, the, tropics, or, a, greenhouse, aphids, may, go, on, reproducing, asexually, for, many, years, aphids, reproducing, asexually, by, parthenogenesis, can, have, genetically, identical, winged, and, non, winged, female, progeny, control, is, complex, some, aphids, alternate, during, their, life, cycles, between, genetic, control, polymorphism, and, environmental, control, polyphenism, of, production, of, winged, or, wingless, forms, winged, progeny, tend, to, be, produced, more, abundantly, under, unfavorable, or, stressful, conditions, some, species, produce, winged, progeny, in, response, to, low, food, quality, or, quantity, e, g, when, a, host, plant, is, starting, to, senesce, the, winged, females, migrate, to, start, new, colonies, on, a, new, host, plant, for, example, the, apple, aphid, aphis, pomi, after, producing, many, generations, of, wingless, females, gives, rise, to, winged, forms, that, fly, to, other, branches, or, trees, of, its, typical, food, plant, aphids, that, are, attacked, by, ladybugs, lacewings, parasitoid, wasps, or, other, predators, can, change, the, dynamics, of, their, progeny, production, when, aphids, are, attacked, by, these, predators, alarm, pheromones, in, particular, beta, farnesene, are, released, from, the, cornicles, these, alarm, pheromones, cause, several, behavioral, modifications, that, depending, on, the, aphid, species, can, include, walking, away, and, dropping, off, the, host, plant, additionally, alarm, pheromone, perception, can, induce, the, aphids, to, produce, winged, progeny, that, can, leave, the, host, plant, in, search, of, a, safer, feeding, site, viral, infections, which, can, be, extremely, harmful, to, aphids, can, also, lead, to, the, production, of, winged, offspring, for, example, densovirus, infection, has, a, negative, impact, on, rosy, apple, aphid, dysaphis, plantaginea, reproduction, but, contributes, to, the, development, of, aphids, with, wings, which, can, transmit, the, virus, more, easily, to, new, host, plants, additionally, symbiotic, bacteria, that, live, inside, of, the, aphids, can, also, alter, aphid, reproductive, strategies, based, on, the, exposure, to, environmental, stressors, in, the, autumn, host, alternating, heteroecious, aphid, species, produce, a, special, winged, generation, that, flies, to, different, host, plants, for, the, sexual, part, of, the, life, cycle, flightless, female, and, male, sexual, forms, are, produced, and, lay, eggs, some, species, such, as, aphis, fabae, black, bean, aphid, metopolophium, dirhodum, rose, grain, aphid, myzus, persicae, peach, potato, aphid, and, rhopalosiphum, padi, bird, cherry, oat, aphid, are, serious, pests, they, overwinter, on, primary, hosts, on, trees, or, bushes, in, summer, they, migrate, to, their, secondary, host, on, a, herbaceous, plant, often, a, crop, then, the, gynoparae, return, to, the, tree, in, autumn, another, example, is, the, soybean, aphid, aphis, glycines, as, fall, approaches, the, soybean, plants, begin, to, senesce, from, the, bottom, upwards, the, aphids, are, forced, upwards, and, start, to, produce, winged, forms, first, females, and, later, males, which, fly, off, to, the, primary, host, buckthorn, here, they, mate, and, overwinter, as, eggs, some, species, of, ants, farm, aphids, protecting, them, on, the, plants, where, they, are, feeding, and, consuming, the, honeydew, the, aphids, release, from, the, terminations, of, their, alimentary, canals, this, is, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, these, dairying, ants, milking, the, aphids, by, stroking, them, with, their, antennae, although, mutualistic, the, feeding, behaviour, of, aphids, is, altered, by, ant, attendance, aphids, attended, by, ants, tend, to, increase, the, production, of, honeydew, in, smaller, drops, with, a, greater, concentration, of, amino, acids, some, farming, ant, species, gather, and, store, the, aphid, eggs, in, their, nests, over, the, winter, in, the, spring, the, ants, carry, the, newly, hatched, aphids, back, to, the, plants, some, species, of, dairying, ants, such, as, the, european, yellow, meadow, ant, lasius, flavus, manage, large, herds, of, aphids, that, feed, on, roots, of, plants, in, the, ant, colony, queens, leaving, to, start, a, new, colony, take, an, aphid, egg, to, found, a, new, herd, of, underground, aphids, in, the, new, colony, these, farming, ants, protect, the, aphids, by, fighting, off, aphid, predators, some, bees, in, coniferous, forests, collect, aphid, honeydew, to, make, forest, honey, an, interesting, variation, in, ant, aphid, relationships, involves, lycaenid, butterflies, and, myrmica, ants, for, example, niphanda, fusca, butterflies, lay, eggs, on, plants, where, ants, tend, herds, of, aphids, the, eggs, hatch, as, caterpillars, which, feed, on, the, aphids, the, ants, do, not, defend, the, aphids, from, the, caterpillars, since, the, caterpillars, produce, a, pheromone, which, deceives, the, ants, into, treating, them, like, ants, and, carrying, the, caterpillars, into, their, nest, once, there, the, ants, feed, the, caterpillars, which, in, return, produce, honeydew, for, the, ants, when, the, caterpillars, reach, full, size, they, crawl, to, the, colony, entrance, and, form, cocoons, after, two, weeks, the, adult, butterflies, emerge, and, take, flight, at, this, point, the, ants, attack, the, butterflies, but, the, butterflies, have, a, sticky, wool, like, substance, on, their, wings, that, disables, the, ants, jaws, allowing, the, butterflies, to, fly, away, without, being, harmed, another, ant, mimicking, gall, aphid, paracletus, cimiciformis, eriosomatinae, has, evolved, a, complex, double, strategy, involving, two, morphs, of, the, same, clone, and, tetramorium, ants, aphids, of, the, round, morph, cause, the, ants, to, farm, them, as, with, many, other, aphids, the, flat, morph, aphids, are, aggressive, mimics, with, a, wolf, in, sheep, s, clothing, strategy, they, have, hydrocarbons, in, their, cuticle, that, mimic, those, of, the, ants, and, the, ants, carry, them, into, the, brood, chamber, of, the, ants, nest, and, raise, them, like, ant, larvae, once, there, the, flat, morph, aphids, behave, like, predators, drinking, the, body, fluids, of, ant, larvae, endosymbiosis, with, micro, organisms, is, common, in, insects, with, more, than, 10, of, insect, species, relying, on, intracellular, bacteria, for, their, development, and, survival, aphids, harbour, a, vertically, transmitted, from, parent, to, its, offspring,

nucleus, the, original, association, is, estimated, to, have, occurred, in, a, common, ancestor, 280, to, 160, million, years, ago, and, enabled, aphids, to, exploit, a, new, ecological, niche,

variation, in, expression, levels, between, different, genes, under, normal, conditions, buchnera, aphidicola, gene, transcription, although, not, well, understood, is, thought, to, be, regulated, by, a, small, number, of, global, transcriptional, regulators, and, or, through, nutrient, supplies, from, the, aphid, host, some, aphid, colonies, also, harbour, secondary, or, facultative, optional, extra, bacterial, symbionts, these, are, vertically, transmitted, and, sometimes, also, horizontally, from, one, lineage, to, another, and, possibly, from, one, species, to, another, so, far, the,

bird, and, insect, predators, in, a, study, on, a, farm, in, north, carolina, six, species, of, passerine, bird, consumed, nearly, a, million, aphids, per, day, between, them, the, top, predators, being, the, american, goldfinch, with, aphids, forming, 83, of, its, diet, and, the, vesper, sparrow, insects, that, attack, aphids, include, the, adults, and, larvae, of, predatory, ladybirds, hoverfly, larvae, parasitic, wasps, aphid, midge, larvae, aphid, lions, the, larvae, of, green, lacewings, and, arachnids, such, as, spiders, among, ladybirds, myzia, oblongoguttata, is, a, dietary, specialist, which, only, feeds, on, conifer, aphids, whereas, adalia, bipunctata, and, coccinella, septempunctata, are, generalists, feeding, on, large, numbers, of, species, the, eggs, are, laid, in, batches, each, female, laying, several, hundred, female, hoverflies, lay, several, thousand, eggs, the, adults, feed, on, pollen, and, nectar, but, the, larvae, feed, voraciously, on, aphids, eupeodes, corollae, adjusts, the, number, of, eggs, laid, to, the, size, of, the, aphid, colony, aphids, are, often, infected, by, bacteria, viruses, and, fungi, they, are, affected, by, the, weather, such, as, precipitation, temperature, and, wind, fungi, that, attack, aphids, include, neozygites, fresenii, entomophthora, beauveria, bassiana, metarhizium, anisopliae, and, entomopathogenic, fungi, such, as, lecanicillium, lecanii, aphids, brush, against, the, microscopic, spores, these, stick, to, the, aphid, germinate, and, penetrate, the, aphid, s, skin, the, fungus, grows, in, the, aphid, s, hemolymph, after, about, three, days, the, aphid, dies, and, the, fungus, releases, more, spores, into, the, air, infected, aphids, are, covered, with, a, woolly, mass, that, progressively, grows, thicker, until, the, aphid, is, obscured, often, the, visible, fungus, is, not, the, one, that, killed, the, aphid, but, a, secondary, infection, aphids, can, be, easily, killed, by, unfavourable, weather, such, as, late, spring, freezes, excessive, heat, kills, the, symbiotic, bacteria, that, some, aphids, depend, on, which, makes, the, aphids, infertile, rain, prevents, winged, aphids, from, dispersing, and, knocks, aphids, off, plants, and, thus, kills, them, from, the, impact, or, by, starvation, but, cannot, be, relied, on, for, aphid, control, most, aphids, have, little, protection, from, predators, some, species, interact, with, plant, tissues, forming, a, gall, an, abnormal, swelling, of, plant, tissue, aphids, can, live, inside, the, gall, which, provides, protection, from, predators, and, the, elements, a, number, of, galling, aphid, species, are, known, to, produce, specialised, soldier, forms, sterile, nymphs, with, defensive, features, which, defend, the, gall, from, invasion, for, example, alexander, s, horned, aphids, are, a, type, of, soldier, aphid, that, has, a, hard, exoskeleton, and, pincer, like, mouthparts, 144, a, woolly, aphid, colophina, clematis, has, first, instar, soldier, nymphs, that, protect, the, aphid, colony, killing, larvae, of, ladybirds, hoverflies, and, the, flower, bug, anthocoris, nemoralis, by, climbing, on, them, and, inserting, their, stylets, although, aphids, cannot, fly, for, most, of, their, life, cycle, they, can, escape, predators, and, accidental, ingestion, by, herbivores, by, dropping, off, the, plant, onto, the, ground, others, species, use, the, soil, as, a, permanent, protection, feeding, on, the, vascular, systems, of, roots, and, remaining, underground, all, their, lives, they, are, often, attended, by, ants, for, the, honeydew, they, produce, and, are, carried, from, plant, to, plant, by, the, ants, through, their, tunnels, some, species, of, aphid, known, as, woolly, aphids, eriosomatinae, excrete, a, fluffy, wax, coating, for, protection, the, cabbage, aphid, brevicoryne, brassicae, sequesters, secondary, metabolites, from, its, host, stores, them, and, releases, chemicals, that, produce, a, violent, chemical, reaction, and, strong, mustard, oil, smell, to, repel, predators, peptides, produced, by, aphids, thaumatins, are, thought, to, provide, them, with, resistance, to, some, fungi, it, was, common, at, one, time, to, suggest, that, the, cornicles, were, the, source, of, the, honeydew, and, this, was, even, included, in, the, shorter, oxford, english, dictionary, and, the, 2008, edition, of, the, world, book, encyclopedia, in, fact, honeydew, secretions, are, produced, from, the, anus, of, the, aphid, while, cornicles, mostly, produce, defensive, chemicals, such, as, waxes, there, also, is, evidence, of, cornicle, wax, attracting, aphid, predators, in, some, cases, some, clones, of, aphis, craccivora, are, sufficiently, toxic, to, the, invasive, and, dominant, predatory, ladybird, harmonia, axyridis, to, suppress, it, locally, favouring, other, ladybird, species, the, toxicity, is, in, this, case, narrowly, specific, to, the, dominant, predator, species, aphids, are, abundant, and, widespread, and, serve, as, hosts, to, a, large, number, of, parasitoids, many, of, them, being, very, small, c, 0, 1, inches, 2, 5, mm, long, parasitoid, wasps, one, species, aphis, ruborum, for, example, is, host, to, at, least, 12, species, of, parasitoid, wasps, parasitoids, have, been, investigated, intensively, as, biological, control, agents, and, many, are, used, commercially, for, this, purpose, plants, mount, local, and, systemic, defenses, against, aphid, attack, young, leaves, in, some, plants, contain, chemicals, that, discourage, attack, while, the, older, leaves, have, lost, this, resistance, while, in, other, plant, species, resistance, is, acquired, by, older, tissues, and, the, young, shoots, are, vulnerable, volatile, products, from, interplanted, onions, have, been, shown, to, prevent, aphid, attack, on, adjacent, potato, plants, by, encouraging, the, production, of, terpenoids, a, benefit, exploited, in, the, traditional, practice, of, companion, planting, while, plants, neighboring, infested, plants, showed, increased, root, growth, at, the, expense, of, the, extension, of, aerial, parts, the, wild, potato, solanum, berthaultii, produces, an, aphid, alarm, pheromone, e, farnesene, as, an, allomone, a, pheromone, to, ward, off, attack, it, effectively, repels, the, aphid, myzus, persicae, at, a, range, of, up, to, 3, millimetres, s, berthaultii, and, other, wild, potato, species, have, a, further, anti, aphid, defence, in, the, form, of, glandular, hairs, which, when, broken, by, aphids, discharge, a, sticky, liquid, that, can, immobilise, some, 30, of, the, aphids, infesting, a, plant, plants, exhibiting, aphid, damage, can, have, a, variety, of, symptoms, such, as, decreased, growth, rates, mottled, leaves, yellowing, stunted, growth, curled, leaves, browning, wilting, low, yields, and, death, the, removal, of, sap, creates, a, lack, of, vigor, in, the, plant, and, aphid, saliva, is, toxic, to, plants, aphids, frequently, transmit, plant, viruses, to, their, hosts, such, as, to, potatoes, cereals, sugarbeets, and, citrus, plants, there, are, two, types, of, virus, transmission, between, plant, aphid, interactions, non, circulative, transmission, and, circulative, transmission, in, non, circulative, transmission, the, virus, attaches, itself, to, the, aphids, mouthparts, and, is, released, when, the, aphids, feed, on, a, different, plant, these, non, circulatory, transmitted, viruses, promotes, rapid, dispersion, of, the, vector, or, aphids, in, circulative, transmission, the, virus, is, ingested, and, passes, through, the, gut, lining, to, enter, the, hemolymph, where, it, is, then, circulated, throughout, the, entire, body, after, reaching, the, salivary, glands, the, virus, is, then, released, into, the, salvia, upon, transmission, sites, in, plants, circulatory, transmitted, viruses, allows, for, long, term, feeding, by, the, aphids, and, increases, the, chances, of, being, infected, with, the, virus, the, green, peach, aphid, myzus, persicae, is, a, vector, for, more, than, 110, plant, viruses, cotton, aphids, aphis, gossypii, often, infect, sugarcane, papaya, and, peanuts, with, viruses, in, plants, which, produce, the, phytoestrogen, coumestrol, such, as, alfalfa, damage, by, aphids, is, linked, with, higher, concentrations, of, coumestrol, the, coating, of, plants, with, honeydew, can, contribute, to, the, spread, of, fungi, which, can, damage, plants, honeydew, produced, by, aphids, has, been, observed, to, reduce, the, effectiveness, of, fungicides, as, well, a, hypothesis, that, insect, feeding, may, improve, plant, fitness, was, floated, in, the, mid, 1970s, by, owen, and, wiegert, it, was, felt, that, the, excess, honeydew, would, nourish, soil, micro, organisms, including, nitrogen, fixers, in, a, nitrogen, poor, environment, this, could, provide, an, advantage, to, an, infested, plant, over, an, uninfested, plant, however, this, does, not, appear, to, be, supported, by, observational, evidence, some, aphids, show, some, of, the, traits, of, eusociality, joining, insects, such, as, ants, bees, and, termites, however, there, are, differences, between, these, sexual, social, insects, and, the, clonal, aphids, which, are, all, descended, from, a, single, female, parthenogenetically, and, share, an, identical, genome, about, fifty, species, of, aphid, scattered, among, the, closely, related, host, alternating, lineages, eriosomatinae, and, hormaphidinae, have, some, type, of, defensive, morph, these, are, gall, creating, species, with, the, colony, living, and, feeding, inside, a, gall, that, they, form, in, the, host, s, tissues, among, the, clonal, population, of, these, aphids, there, may, be, several, distinct, morphs, and, this, lays, the, foundation, for, a, possible, specialization, of, function, in, this, case, a, defensive, caste, the, soldier, morphs, are, mostly, first, and, second, instars, with, the, third, instar, being, involved, in, eriosoma, moriokense, and, only, in, smythurodes, betae, are, adult, soldiers, known, the, hind, legs, of, soldiers, are, clawed, heavily, sclerotized, and, the, stylets, are, robust, making, it, possible, to, rupture, and, crush, small, predators, the, larval, soldiers, are, altruistic, individuals, unable, to, advance, to, breeding, adults, but, acting, permanently, in, the, interests, of, the, colony, another, requirement, for, the, development, of, sociality, is, provided, by, the, gall, a, colonial, home, to, be, defended, by, the, soldiers, the, soldiers, of, gall, forming, aphids, also, carry, out, the, job, of, cleaning, the, gall, the, honeydew, secreted, by, the, aphids, is, coated, in, a, powdery, wax, to, form, liquid, marbles, that, the, soldiers, roll, out, of, the, gall, through, small, orifices, aphids, that, form, closed, galls, use, the, plant, s, vascular, system, for, their, plumbing, the, inner, surfaces, of, the, galls, are, highly, absorbent, and, wastes, are, absorbed, and, carried, away, by, the, plant, about, 5000, species, of, aphid, have, been, described, and, of, these, some, 450, species, have, colonized, food, and, fiber, crops, as, direct, feeders, on, plant, sap, they, damage, crops, and, reduce, yields, but, they, have, a, greater, impact, by, being, vectors, of, plant, viruses, the, transmission, of, these, viruses, depends, on, the, movements, of, aphids, between, different, parts, of, a, plant, between, nearby, plants, and, further, afield, in, this, respect, the, probing, behavior, of, an, aphid, tasting, a, host, is, more, damaging, than, lengthy, aphid, feeding, and, reproduction, by, stay, put, individuals, the, movement, of, aphids, influences, the, timing, of, virus, epidemics, they, are, major, pests, of, greenhouse, crops, and, species, often, encountered, in, greenhouses, include, green, peach, aphid, myzus, persicae, cotton, or, melon, aphid, aphis, gossypii, potato, aphid, macrosiphum, euphorbiae, foxglove, aphid, aulacorthum, solani, and, chrysanthemum, aphid, macrosiphoniella, sanborni, and, others, which, cause, leaf, yellowing, distorted, leaves, and, plant, stunting, the, excreted, honeydew, is, a, growing, medium, for, a, number, of, fungal, pathogens, including, black, sooty, molds, from, the, genera, capnodium, fumago, and, scorias, which, then, infect, leaves, and, inhibit, growth, by, reducing, photosynthesis, aphids, especially, during, large, outbreaks, have, been, known, to, trigger, allergic, inhalant, reactions, in, sensitive, humans, dispersal, can, be, by, walking, or, flight, appetitive, dispersal, or, by, migration, winged, aphids, are, weak, fliers, lose, their, wings, after, a, few, days, and, only, fly, by, day, dispersal, by, flight, is, affected, by, the, impact, air, currents, gravity, precipitation, and, other, factors, or, dispersal, may, be, accidental, caused, by, the, movement, of, plant, materials, animals, farm, machinery, vehicles, or, aircraft, insecticide, control, of, aphids, is, difficult, as, they, breed, rapidly, so, even, small, areas, missed, may, enable, the, population, to, recover, promptly, aphids, may, occupy, the, undersides, of, leaves, where, spray, misses, them, while, systemic, insecticides, do, not, move, satisfactorily, into, flower, petals, finally, some, aphid, species, are, resistant, to, common, insecticide, classes, including, carbamates, organophosphates, and, pyrethroids, for, small, backyard, infestations, spraying, plants, thoroughly, with, a, strong, water, jet, every, few, days, may, be, sufficient, protection, an, insecticidal, soap, solution, can, be, an, effective, household, remedy, to, control, aphids, but, it, only, kills, aphids, on, contact, and, has, no, residual, effect, soap, spray, may, damage, plants, especially, at, higher, concentrations, or, at, temperatures, above, 32, c, 90, f, some, plant, species, are, sensitive, to, soap, sprays, aphid, populations, can, be, sampled, using, yellow, pan, or, moericke, traps, these, are, yellow, containers, with, water, that, attract, aphids, aphids, respond, positively, to, green, and, their, attraction, to, yellow, may, not, be, a, true, colour, preference, but, related, to, brightness, their, visual, receptors, peak, in, sensitivity, from, 440, to, 480, nm, and, are, insensitive, in, the, red, region, moericke, found, that, aphids, avoided, landing, on, white, coverings, placed, on, soil, and, were, repelled, even, more, by, shiny, aluminium, surfaces, integrated, pest, management, of, various, species, of, aphids, can, be, achieved, using, biological, insecticides, based, on, fungi, such, as, lecanicillium, lecanii, beauveria, bassiana, or, isaria, fumosorosea, fungi, are, the, main, pathogens, of, aphids, entomophthorales, can, quickly, cut, aphid, numbers, in, nature, aphids, may, also, be, controlled, by, the, release, of, natural, enemies, in, particular, lady, beetles, and, parasitoid, wasps, however, since, adult, lady, beetles, tend, to, fly, away, within, 48, hours, after, release, without, laying, eggs, repeated, applications, of, large, numbers, of, lady, beetles, are, needed, to, be, effective, for, example, one, large, heavily, infested, rose, bush, may, take, two, applications, of, 1500, beetles, each, the, ability, to, produce, allomones, such, as, farnesene, to, repel, and, disperse, aphids, and, to, attract, their, predators, has, been, experimentally, transferred, to, transgenic, arabidopsis, thaliana, plants, using, an, e, f, synthase, gene, in, the, hope, that, the, approach, could, protect, transgenic, crops, e, farnesene, has, however, found, to, be, ineffective, in, crop, situations, although, stabler, synthetic, forms, help, improve, the, effectiveness, of, control, using, fungal, spores, and, insecticides, through, increased, uptake, caused, by, movements, of, aphids, aphids, are, familiar, to, farmers, and, gardeners, mainly, as, pests, peter, marren, and, richard, mabey, record, that, gilbert, white, described, an, invading, army, of, black, aphids, that, arrived, in, his, village, of, selborne, hampshire, england, in, august, 1774, in, great, clouds, covering, every, plant, while, in, the, unusually, hot, summer, of, 1783, white, found, that, honeydew, was, so, abundant, as, to, deface, and, destroy, the, beauties, of, my, garden, though, he, thought, the, aphids, were, consuming, rather, than, producing, it, infestation, of, the, chinese, sumac, rhus, chinensis, by, chinese, sumac, aphids, schlechtendalia, chinensis, can, create, chinese, galls, which, are, valued, as, a, commercial, product, as, galla, chinensis, they, are, used, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, to, treat, coughs, diarrhea, night, sweats, dysentery, and, to, stop, intestinal, and, uterine, bleeding, chinese, galls, are, also, an, important, source, of, tannins,
