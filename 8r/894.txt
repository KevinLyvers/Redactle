https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred
the, thoroughbred, is, a, horse, breed, developed, for, horse, racing, although, the, word, thoroughbred, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, any, breed, of, purebred, horse, it, technically, refers, only, to, the, thoroughbred, breed, thoroughbreds, are, considered, hot, blooded, horses, that, are, known, for, agility, speed, and, spirit, the, thoroughbred, was, developed, in, 17th, and, 18th, century, england, when, native, mares, were, crossbred, with, imported, stallions, of, arabian, barb, and, turkoman, breeding, all, modern, thoroughbreds, can, trace, their, pedigrees, to, three, stallions, imported, into, england, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, and, to, a, larger, number, of, foundation, mares, of, mostly, english, breeding, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, thoroughbred, breed, spread, throughout, the, world, they, were, imported, into, north, america, starting, in, 1730, and, into, australia, europe, japan, and, south, america, during, the, 19th, century, millions, of, thoroughbreds, exist, and, around, 100, 000, foals, are, registered, each, year, worldwide, thoroughbreds, are, used, mainly, for, racing, but, are, also, bred, for, other, riding, disciplines, such, as, show, jumping, combined, training, dressage, polo, and, fox, hunting, they, are, also, commonly, crossbred, to, create, new, breeds, or, to, improve, existing, ones, and, have, been, influential, in, the, creation, of, the, quarter, horse, standardbred, anglo, arabian, and, various, warmblood, breeds, thoroughbred, racehorses, perform, with, maximum, exertion, which, has, resulted, in, high, accident, rates, and, health, problems, such, as, bleeding, from, the, lungs, other, health, concerns, include, low, fertility, abnormally, small, hearts, and, a, small, hoof, to, body, mass, ratio, there, are, several, theories, for, the, reasons, behind, the, prevalence, of, accidents, and, health, problems, in, the, thoroughbred, breed, and, research, on, the, subject, is, ongoing, the, typical, thoroughbred, ranges, from, 15, 2, to, 17, 0, hands, 62, to, 68, inches, 157, to, 173, cm, high, averaging, 16, hands, 64, inches, 163, cm, they, are, most, often, bay, dark, bay, or, brown, chestnut, black, or, gray, less, common, colors, recognized, in, the, united, states, include, roan, and, palomino, white, is, very, rare, but, is, a, recognized, color, separate, from, gray, the, face, and, lower, legs, may, be, marked, with, white, but, white, will, generally, not, appear, on, the, body, coat, patterns, that, have, more, than, one, color, on, the, body, such, as, pinto, or, appaloosa, are, not, recognized, by, mainstream, breed, registries, good, quality, thoroughbreds, have, a, well, chiseled, head, on, a, long, neck, high, withers, a, deep, chest, a, short, back, good, depth, of, hindquarters, a, lean, body, and, long, legs, thoroughbreds, are, classified, among, the, hot, blooded, breeds, which, are, animals, bred, for, agility, and, speed, and, are, generally, considered, spirited, and, bold, thoroughbreds, born, in, the, northern, hemisphere, are, officially, considered, a, year, older, on, the, first, of, january, each, year, those, born, in, the, southern, hemisphere, officially, are, one, year, older, on, the, first, of, august, these, artificial, dates, have, been, set, to, enable, the, standardization, of, races, and, other, competitions, for, horses, in, certain, age, groups, the, thoroughbred, is, a, distinct, breed, of, horse, although, people, sometimes, refer, to, a, purebred, horse, of, any, breed, as, a, thoroughbred, the, term, for, any, horse, or, other, animal, derived, from, a, single, breed, line, is, purebred, while, the, term, probably, came, into, general, use, because, the, english, thoroughbred, s, general, stud, book, was, one, of, the, first, breed, registries, created, in, modern, usage, horse, breeders, consider, it, incorrect, to, refer, to, any, animal, as, a, thoroughbred, except, for, horses, belonging, to, the, thoroughbred, breed, nonetheless, breeders, of, other, species, of, purebred, animals, may, use, the, two, terms, interchangeably, though, thoroughbred, is, less, often, used, for, describing, purebred, animals, of, other, species, the, term, is, a, proper, noun, referring, to, this, specific, breed, though, often, not, capitalized, especially, in, non, specialist, publications, and, outside, the, us, for, example, the, australian, stud, book, the, new, york, times, and, the, bbc, do, not, capitalize, the, word, flat, racing, existed, in, england, by, at, least, 1174, when, four, mile, races, took, place, at, smithfield, in, london, racing, continued, at, fairs, and, markets, throughout, the, middle, ages, and, into, the, reign, of, king, james, i, of, england, it, was, then, that, handicapping, a, system, of, adding, weight, to, attempt, to, equalize, a, horse, s, chances, of, winning, as, well, as, improved, training, procedures, began, to, be, used, during, the, reigns, of, charles, ii, william, iii, anne, and, george, i, the, foundation, of, the, thoroughbred, was, laid, the, term, thro, bred, to, describe, horses, was, first, used, in, 1713, under, charles, ii, a, keen, racegoer, and, owner, and, anne, royal, support, was, given, to, racing, and, the, breeding, of, race, horses, with, royal, support, horse, racing, became, popular, with, the, public, and, by, 1727, a, newspaper, devoted, to, racing, the, racing, calendar, was, founded, devoted, exclusively, to, the, sport, it, recorded, race, results, and, advertised, upcoming, meets, all, modern, thoroughbreds, trace, their, origin, to, one, of, three, stallions, imported, into, england, from, the, middle, east, in, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, the, byerley, turk, 1680s, the, darley, arabian, 1704, and, the, godolphin, arabian, 1729, other, imported, stallions, were, less, influential, but, still, made, noteworthy, contributions, to, the, breed, these, included, the, alcock, s, arabian, d, arcy, s, white, turk, leedes, arabian, and, curwen, s, bay, barb, another, was, the, brownlow, turk, who, among, other, attributes, is, thought, to, be, largely, responsible, for, the, gray, coat, color, in, thoroughbreds, in, all, about, 160, stallions, have, been, traced, in, the, historical, record, as, contributing, to, the, creation, of, the, thoroughbred, the, addition, of, horses, of, eastern, bloodlines, whether, arabian, barb, or, turk, to, the, native, english, mares, ultimately, led, to, the, creation, of, the, general, stud, book, gsb, in, 1791, and, the, practice, of, official, registration, of, horses, according, to, peter, willett, about, 50, of, the, foundation, stallions, appear, to, have, been, of, arabian, bloodlines, with, the, remainder, being, evenly, divided, between, turkoman, and, barb, breeding, each, of, the, three, major, foundation, sires, was, coincidentally, the, ancestor, of, a, grandson, or, great, great, grandson, who, was, the, only, male, descendant, to, perpetuate, each, respective, horse, s, male, line, matchem, was, the, only, descendant, of, his, grandsire, the, godolphin, arabian, to, maintain, a, male, line, to, the, present, the, byerley, turk, s, male, line, was, preserved, by, herod, or, king, herod, a, great, great, grandson, and, the, male, line, of, the, darley, arabian, owes, its, existence, to, great, great, grandson, eclipse, who, was, the, dominant, racehorse, of, his, day, and, never, defeated, one, genetic, study, indicates, that, 95, of, all, male, thoroughbreds, trace, their, direct, male, line, via, the, y, chromosome, to, the, darley, arabian, however, in, modern, thoroughbred, pedigrees, most, horses, have, more, crosses, to, the, godolphin, arabian, 13, 8, than, to, the, darley, arabian, 6, 5, when, all, lines, of, descent, maternal, and, paternal, are, considered, further, as, a, percentage, of, contributions, to, current, thoroughbred, bloodlines, curwen, s, bay, barb, 4, 2, appears, more, often, than, the, byerley, turk, 3, 3, the, majority, of, modern, thoroughbreds, alive, trace, to, a, total, of, only, 27, or, 28, stallions, from, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, mares, used, as, foundation, breeding, stock, came, from, a, variety, of, breeds, some, of, which, such, as, the, irish, hobby, had, developed, in, northern, europe, prior, to, the, 13th, century, other, mares, were, of, oriental, breeding, including, barb, turk, and, other, bloodlines, although, most, researchers, conclude, that, the, number, of, eastern, mares, imported, into, england, during, the, 100, years, after, 1660, was, small, the, 19th, century, researcher, bruce, lowe, identified, 50, mare, families, in, the, thoroughbred, breed, later, augmented, by, other, researchers, to, 74, however, it, is, probable, that, fewer, genetically, unique, mare, lines, existed, than, lowe, identified, recent, studies, of, the, mtdna, of, thoroughbred, mares, indicate, that, some, of, the, mare, lines, thought, to, be, genetically, distinct, may, actually, have, had, a, common, ancestor, in, 19, mare, lines, studied, the, haplotypes, revealed, that, they, traced, to, only, 15, unique, foundation, mares, suggesting, either, a, common, ancestor, for, foundation, mares, thought, to, be, unrelated, or, recording, errors, in, the, gsb, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, english, classic, races, had, been, established, these, are, the, st, leger, stakes, founded, in, 1776, the, oaks, founded, in, 1779, and, the, derby, in, 1780, later, the, 2, 000, guineas, stakes, and, the, 1, 000, guineas, stakes, were, founded, in, 1809, and, 1814, the, 1, 000, guineas, and, the, oaks, are, restricted, to, fillies, but, the, others, are, open, to, racehorses, of, either, sex, aged, three, years, the, distances, of, these, races, ranging, from, one, mile, 1, 6, km, to, 1, 75, miles, 2, 82, km, led, to, a, change, in, breeding, practices, as, breeders, concentrated, on, producing, horses, that, could, race, at, a, younger, age, than, in, the, past, and, that, had, more, speed, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, emphasis, had, been, on, longer, races, up, to, 4, miles, 6, 4, km, that, were, run, in, multiple, heats, the, older, style, of, race, favored, older, horses, but, with, the, change, in, distances, younger, horses, became, preferred, selective, breeding, for, speed, and, racing, ability, led, to, improvements, in, the, size, of, horses, and, winning, times, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, bay, middleton, a, winner, of, the, epsom, derby, stood, over, 16, hands, high, a, full, hand, higher, than, the, darley, arabian, winning, times, had, improved, to, such, a, degree, that, many, felt, further, improvement, by, adding, additional, arabian, bloodlines, was, impossible, this, was, borne, out, in, 1885, when, a, race, was, held, between, a, thoroughbred, iambic, considered, a, mid, grade, runner, and, the, best, arabian, of, the, time, asil, the, race, was, over, 3, miles, 4, 800, m, and, although, iambic, was, handicapped, by, carrying, 4, 5, stone, 29, kg, 63, lb, more, than, asil, he, still, managed, to, beat, asil, by, 20, lengths, the, improvement, of, the, breed, for, racing, in, this, way, was, said, by, noted, 19th, century, racing, writer, nimrod, to, have, created, the, noblest, animal, in, the, creation, an, aspect, of, the, modern, british, breeding, establishment, is, that, they, breed, not, only, for, flat, racing, but, also, for, steeplechasing, up, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, thoroughbreds, were, bred, not, only, for, racing, but, also, as, saddle, horses, soon, after, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, fears, that, the, english, races, would, be, overrun, with, american, bred, thoroughbreds, because, of, the, closing, of, us, racetracks, in, the, early, 1910s, led, to, the, jersey, act, of, 1913, it, prohibited, the, registration, of, any, horse, in, the, general, stud, book, gsb, if, they, could, not, show, that, every, ancestor, traced, to, the, gsb, this, excluded, most, american, bred, horses, because, the, 100, year, gap, between, the, founding, of, the, gsb, and, the, american, stud, book, meant, that, most, american, bred, horses, possessed, at, least, one, or, two, crosses, to, horses, not, registered, in, the, gsb, the, act, was, not, repealed, until, 1949, after, which, a, horse, was, only, required, to, show, that, all, its, ancestors, to, the, ninth, generation, were, registered, in, a, recognized, stud, book, many, felt, that, the, jersey, act, hampered, the, development, of, the, british, thoroughbred, by, preventing, breeders, in, the, united, kingdom, from, using, new, bloodlines, developed, outside, the, british, isles, the, first, thoroughbred, horse, in, the, american, colonies, was, bulle, rock, imported, in, 1730, maryland, and, virginia, were, the, centers, of, colonial, thoroughbred, breeding, along, with, south, carolina, and, new, york, during, the, american, revolution, importations, of, horses, from, england, practically, stopped, but, were, restarted, after, the, signing, of, a, peace, treaty, two, important, stallions, were, imported, around, the, time, of, the, revolution, messenger, in, 1788, and, diomed, before, that, messenger, left, little, impact, on, the, american, thoroughbred, but, is, considered, a, foundation, sire, of, the, standardbred, breed, diomed, who, won, the, derby, stakes, in, 1780, had, a, significant, impact, on, american, thoroughbred, breeding, mainly, through, his, son, sir, archy, john, f, wall, a, racing, historian, said, that, sir, archy, was, the, first, outstanding, stallion, we, can, claim, as, native, american, he, was, retired, from, the, racetrack, because, of, lack, of, opponents, medley, and, shark, who, arrived, in, the, united, states, before, messenger, and, diomed, became, important, broodmare, and, dam, sires, by, producing, foundation, stock, and, their, daughters, and, granddaughters, were, bred, primarily, to, diomed, after, the, american, revolution, the, center, of, thoroughbred, breeding, and, racing, in, the, united, states, moved, west, kentucky, and, tennessee, became, significant, centers, andrew, jackson, later, president, of, the, united, states, was, a, breeder, and, racer, of, thoroughbreds, in, tennessee, match, races, held, in, the, early, 19th, century, helped, to, popularize, horse, racing, in, the, united, states, one, took, place, in, 1823, in, long, island, new, york, between, sir, henry, and, american, eclipse, another, was, a, match, race, between, boston, and, fashion, in, 1838, that, featured, bets, of, 20, 000, from, each, side, the, last, major, match, races, before, the, american, civil, war, were, both, between, lexington, and, lecompte, the, first, was, held, in, 1854, in, new, orleans, and, was, won, by, lecompte, lexington, s, owner, then, challenged, lecompte, s, owner, to, a, rematch, held, in, 1855, in, new, orleans, and, won, by, lexington, both, of, these, horses, were, sons, of, boston, a, descendant, of, sir, archy, lexington, went, on, to, a, career, as, a, breeding, stallion, and, led, the, sires, list, of, number, of, winners, for, sixteen, years, fourteen, of, them, in, a, row, after, the, american, civil, war, the, emphasis, in, american, racing, changed, from, the, older, style, of, four, mile, 6, km, races, in, which, the, horses, ran, in, at, least, two, heats, the, new, style, of, racing, involved, shorter, races, not, run, in, heats, over, distances, from, five, furlongs, up, to, 1, 5, miles, 2, 4, km, this, development, meant, a, change, in, breeding, practices, as, well, as, the, age, that, horses, were, raced, with, younger, horses, and, sprinters, coming, to, the, fore, it, was, also, after, the, civil, war, that, the, american, thoroughbred, returned, to, england, to, race, iroquois, became, the, first, american, bred, winner, of, the, epsom, derby, in, 1881, the, success, of, american, bred, thoroughbreds, in, england, led, to, the, jersey, act, in, 1913, which, limited, the, importation, of, american, thoroughbreds, into, england, after, world, war, i, the, breeders, in, america, continued, to, emphasize, speed, and, early, racing, age, but, also, imported, horses, from, england, and, this, trend, continued, past, world, war, ii, after, world, war, ii, thoroughbred, breeding, remained, centered, in, kentucky, but, california, new, york, and, florida, also, emerged, as, important, racing, and, breeding, centers, thoroughbreds, in, the, united, states, have, historically, been, used, not, only, for, racing, but, also, to, improve, other, breeds, the, early, import, messenger, was, the, foundation, of, the, standardbred, and, thoroughbred, blood, was, also, instrumental, in, the, development, of, the, american, quarter, horse, the, foundation, stallion, of, the, morgan, breed, is, held, by, some, to, have, been, sired, by, a, thoroughbred, between, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, the, u, s, army, used, thoroughbred, stallions, as, part, of, their, remount, service, which, was, designed, to, improve, the, stock, of, cavalry, mounts, thoroughbreds, began, to, be, imported, to, france, in, 1817, and, 1818, with, the, importation, of, a, number, of, stallions, from, england, but, initially, the, sport, of, horse, racing, did, not, prosper, in, france, the, first, jockey, club, in, france, was, not, formed, until, 1833, and, in, 1834, the, racing, and, regulation, functions, were, split, off, to, a, new, society, the, soci, t, d, encouragement, pour, l, am, lioration, des, races, de, chevaux, en, france, better, known, as, the, jockey, club, de, paris, the, french, stud, book, was, founded, at, the, same, time, by, the, government, by, 1876, french, bred, thoroughbreds, were, regularly, winning, races, in, england, and, in, that, year, a, french, breeder, owner, earned, the, most, money, in, england, on, the, track, world, war, i, almost, destroyed, french, breeding, because, of, war, damage, and, lack, of, races, after, the, war, the, premier, french, race, the, grand, prix, resumed, and, continues, to, this, day, during, world, war, ii, french, thoroughbred, breeding, did, not, suffer, as, it, had, during, the, first, world, war, and, thus, was, able, to, compete, on, an, equal, footing, with, other, countries, after, the, war, organized, racing, in, italy, started, in, 1837, when, race, meets, were, established, in, florence, and, naples, and, a, meet, in, milan, was, founded, in, 1842, modern, flat, racing, came, to, rome, in, 1868, later, importations, including, the, derby, stakes, winners, ellington, 1856, and, melton, 1885, came, to, italy, before, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, modern, thoroughbred, breeding, in, italy, is, mostly, associated, with, the, breeding, program, of, federico, tesio, who, started, his, breeding, program, in, 1898, tesio, was, the, breeder, of, nearco, one, of, the, dominant, sires, of, thoroughbreds, in, the, later, part, of, the, 20th, century, other, countries, in, europe, have, thoroughbred, breeding, programs, including, germany, russia, poland, and, hungary, horses, arrived, in, australia, with, the, first, fleet, in, 1788, along, with, the, earliest, colonists, although, horses, of, part, thoroughbred, blood, were, imported, into, australia, during, the, late, 18th, century, it, is, thought, that, the, first, pureblood, thoroughbred, was, a, stallion, named, northumberland, who, was, imported, from, england, in, 1802, as, a, coach, horse, sire, by, 1810, the, first, formal, race, meets, were, organized, in, sydney, and, by, 1825, the, first, mare, of, proven, thoroughbred, bloodlines, arrived, to, join, the, thoroughbred, stallions, already, there, in, 1825, the, sydney, turf, club, the, first, true, racing, club, in, australia, was, formed, throughout, the, 1830s, the, australian, colonies, began, to, import, thoroughbreds, almost, exclusively, for, racing, purposes, and, to, improve, the, local, stock, each, colony, formed, its, own, racing, clubs, and, held, its, own, races, gradually, the, individual, clubs, were, integrated, into, one, overarching, organization, now, known, as, the, australian, racing, board, thoroughbreds, from, australia, were, imported, into, new, zealand, in, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, with, the, first, direct, importation, from, england, occurring, in, 1862, thoroughbreds, have, been, exported, to, many, other, areas, of, the, world, since, the, breed, was, created, oriental, horses, were, imported, into, south, africa, from, the, late, 17th, century, in, order, to, improve, the, local, stock, through, crossbreeding, horse, racing, was, established, there, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, and, thoroughbreds, were, imported, in, increasing, numbers, the, first, thoroughbred, stallions, arrived, in, argentina, in, 1853, but, the, first, mares, did, not, arrive, until, 1865, the, argentine, stud, book, was, first, published, in, 1893, thoroughbreds, were, imported, into, japan, from, 1895, although, it, was, not, until, after, world, war, ii, that, japan, began, a, serious, breeding, and, racing, business, involving, thoroughbreds, the, number, of, thoroughbred, foals, registered, each, year, in, north, america, varies, greatly, chiefly, linked, to, the, success, of, the, auction, market, which, in, turn, depends, on, the, state, of, the, economy, the, foal, crop, was, over, 44, 000, in, 1990, but, declined, to, roughly, 22, 500, by, 2014, the, largest, numbers, are, registered, in, the, states, of, kentucky, florida, and, california, australia, is, the, second, largest, producer, of, thoroughbreds, in, the, world, with, almost, 30, 000, broodmares, producing, about, 18, 250, foals, annually, britain, produces, about, 5, 000, foals, a, year, and, worldwide, there, are, more, than, 195, 000, active, broodmares, or, females, being, used, for, breeding, and, 118, 000, newly, registered, foals, in, 2006, alone, the, thoroughbred, industry, is, a, large, agribusiness, generating, around, 34, billion, in, revenue, annually, in, the, united, states, and, providing, about, 470, 000, jobs, through, a, network, of, farms, training, centers, and, race, tracks, unlike, a, significant, number, of, registered, breeds, a, horse, cannot, be, registered, as, a, thoroughbred, with, the, jockey, club, registry, unless, conceived, by, live, cover, the, witnessed, natural, mating, of, a, mare, and, a, stallion, artificial, insemination, ai, and, embryo, transfer, et, though, commonly, used, and, allowable, in, many, other, horse, breed, registries, cannot, be, used, with, thoroughbreds, one, reason, is, that, a, greater, possibility, of, error, exists, in, assigning, parentage, with, artificial, insemination, and, although, dna, and, blood, testing, eliminate, many, of, those, concerns, artificial, insemination, still, requires, more, detailed, record, keeping, the, main, reason, however, may, be, economic, a, stallion, has, a, limited, number, of, mares, who, can, be, serviced, by, live, cover, thus, the, practice, prevents, an, oversupply, of, thoroughbreds, although, modern, management, still, allows, a, stallion, to, live, cover, more, mares, in, a, season, than, was, once, thought, possible, as, an, example, in, 2008, the, australian, stallion, encosta, de, lago, covered, 227, mares, by, allowing, a, stallion, to, cover, only, a, couple, of, hundred, mares, a, year, rather, than, the, couple, of, thousand, possible, with, artificial, insemination, it, also, preserves, the, high, prices, paid, for, horses, of, the, finest, or, most, popular, lineages, concern, exists, that, the, closed, stud, book, and, tightly, regulated, population, of, the, thoroughbred, is, at, risk, of, loss, of, genetic, diversity, because, of, the, level, of, inadvertent, inbreeding, inevitable, in, such, a, small, population, according, to, a, 2001, study, 78, of, alleles, in, the, population, can, be, traced, to, 30, foundation, animals, 27, of, which, are, male, ten, foundation, mares, account, for, 72, of, maternal, tail, female, lineages, and, as, noted, one, stallion, appears, in, 95, of, tail, male, lineages, thoroughbred, pedigrees, are, generally, traced, through, the, maternal, line, called, the, distaff, line, the, line, that, a, horse, comes, from, is, a, critical, factor, in, determining, the, price, for, a, young, horse, prices, of, thoroughbreds, vary, greatly, depending, on, age, pedigree, conformation, and, other, market, factors, in, 2007, keeneland, sales, a, united, states, based, sales, company, sold, 9, 124, horses, at, auction, with, a, total, value, of, 814, 401, 000, which, gives, an, average, price, of, 89, 259, as, a, whole, for, the, united, states, in, 2007, the, jockey, club, auction, statistics, indicated, that, the, average, weanling, sold, for, 44, 407, the, average, yearling, sold, for, 55, 300, average, sale, price, for, two, year, olds, was, 61, 843, broodmares, averaged, 70, 150, and, horses, over, two, and, broodmare, prospects, sold, for, an, average, of, 53, 243, for, europe, the, july, 2007, tattersall, s, sale, sold, 593, horses, at, auction, with, a, total, for, the, sale, of, 10, 951, 300, guineas, for, an, average, of, 18, 468, guineas, also, in, 2007, doncaster, bloodstock, sales, another, british, sales, firm, sold, 2, 248, horses, for, a, total, value, of, 43, 033, 881, guineas, making, an, average, of, 15, 110, guineas, per, horse, australian, prices, at, auction, during, the, 2007, 2008, racing, and, breeding, season, were, as, follows, 1, 223, australian, weanlings, sold, for, a, total, of, 31, 352, 000, an, average, of, 25, 635, each, four, thousand, nine, hundred, and, three, yearlings, sold, for, a, total, value, of, a, 372, 003, 961, an, average, of, a, 75, 853, five, hundred, two, year, olds, sold, for, a, 13, 030, 150, an, average, of, a, 26, 060, and, 2, 118, broodmares, totalled, a, 107, 720, 775, an, average, of, a, 50, 860, averages, however, can, be, deceiving, for, example, at, the, 2007, fall, yearling, sale, at, keeneland, 3, 799, young, horses, sold, for, a, total, of, 385, 018, 600, for, an, average, of, 101, 347, per, horse, however, that, average, sales, price, reflected, a, variation, that, included, at, least, 19, horses, that, sold, for, only, 1, 000, each, and, 34, that, sold, for, over, 1, 000, 000, apiece, the, highest, price, paid, at, auction, for, a, thoroughbred, was, set, in, 2006, at, 16, 000, 000, for, a, two, year, old, colt, named, the, green, monkey, record, prices, at, auction, often, grab, headlines, though, they, do, not, necessarily, reflect, the, animal, s, future, success, in, the, case, of, the, green, monkey, injuries, limited, him, to, only, three, career, starts, before, being, retired, to, stud, in, 2008, and, he, never, won, a, race, conversely, even, a, highly, successful, thoroughbred, may, be, sold, by, the, pound, for, a, few, hundred, dollars, to, become, horsemeat, the, best, known, example, of, this, was, the, 1986, kentucky, derby, winner, ferdinand, exported, to, japan, to, stand, at, stud, but, was, ultimately, slaughtered, in, 2002, presumably, for, pet, food, however, the, value, of, a, thoroughbred, may, also, be, influenced, by, the, purse, money, it, wins, in, 2007, thoroughbred, racehorses, earned, a, total, of, 1, 217, 854, 602, in, all, placings, an, average, earnings, per, starter, of, 16, 924, in, addition, the, track, record, of, a, race, horse, may, influence, its, future, value, as, a, breeding, animal, stud, fees, for, stallions, that, enter, breeding, can, range, from, 2, 500, to, 500, 000, per, mare, in, the, united, states, and, from, 2000, to, 75, 000, or, more, in, britain, the, record, stud, fee, to, date, was, set, in, the, 1980s, when, the, stud, fee, of, the, late, northern, dancer, reached, 1, million, during, the, 2008, australian, breeding, season, seven, stallions, stood, at, a, stud, fee, of, a, 110, 000, or, more, with, the, highest, fee, in, the, nation, at, a, 302, 500, although, the, thoroughbred, is, primarily, bred, for, racing, the, breed, is, also, used, for, show, jumping, and, combined, training, because, of, its, athleticism, and, many, retired, and, retrained, race, horses, become, fine, family, riding, horses, dressage, horses, and, youth, show, horses, the, larger, horses, are, sought, for, hunter, jumper, and, dressage, competitions, whereas, the, smaller, horses, are, in, demand, as, polo, ponies, thoroughbred, horses, are, primarily, bred, for, racing, under, saddle, at, the, gallop, thoroughbreds, are, often, known, for, being, either, distance, runners, or, sprinters, and, their, conformation, usually, reflects, what, they, have, been, bred, to, do, sprinters, are, usually, well, muscled, while, stayers, or, distance, runners, tend, to, be, smaller, and, slimmer, the, size, of, the, horse, is, one, consideration, for, buyers, and, trainers, when, choosing, a, potential, racehorse, although, there, have, been, champion, racehorses, of, every, height, from, zenyatta, who, stood, 17, 2, hands, to, man, o, war, and, secretariat, who, both, stood, at, 16, 2, hands, down, to, hyperion, who, was, only, 15, 1, the, best, racehorses, are, generally, of, average, size, larger, horses, mature, more, slowly, and, have, more, stress, on, their, legs, and, feet, predisposing, them, to, lameness, smaller, horses, are, considered, by, some, to, be, at, a, disadvantage, due, to, their, shorter, stride, and, a, tendency, of, other, horses, to, bump, them, especially, in, the, starting, gate, historically, thoroughbreds, have, steadily, increased, in, size, the, average, height, of, a, thoroughbred, in, 1700, was, about, 13, 3, hands, high, by, 1876, this, had, increased, to, 15, 3, in, 2007, there, were, 71, 959, horses, who, started, in, races, in, the, united, states, and, the, average, thoroughbred, racehorse, in, the, united, states, and, canada, ran, 6, 33, times, in, that, year, in, australia, there, were, 31, 416, horses, in, training, during, 2007, and, those, horses, started, 194, 066, times, for, a, 375, 512, 579, of, prize, money, during, 2007, in, japan, there, were, 23, 859, horses, in, training, and, those, horses, started, 182, 614, times, for, a, 857, 446, 268, of, prize, money, in, britain, the, british, racing, authority, states, there, were, 8, 556, horses, in, training, for, flat, racing, for, 2007, and, those, horses, started, 60, 081, times, in, 5, 659, races, statistically, fewer, than, 50, of, all, race, horses, ever, win, a, race, and, less, than, 1, ever, win, a, stakes, race, such, as, the, kentucky, derby, or, epsom, derby, any, horse, who, has, yet, to, win, a, race, is, known, as, a, maiden, horses, finished, with, a, racing, career, that, are, not, suitable, for, breeding, purposes, often, become, riding, horses, or, other, equine, companions, a, number, of, agencies, exist, to, help, make, the, transition, from, the, racetrack, to, another, career, or, to, help, find, retirement, homes, for, ex, racehorses, in, addition, to, racing, thoroughbreds, compete, in, eventing, show, jumping, and, dressage, at, the, highest, levels, of, international, competition, including, the, olympics, they, are, also, used, as, show, hunters, steeplechasers, and, in, western, riding, speed, events, such, as, barrel, racing, mounted, police, divisions, employ, them, in, non, competitive, work, and, recreational, riders, also, use, them, thoroughbreds, are, one, of, the, most, common, breeds, for, use, in, polo, in, the, united, states, they, are, often, seen, in, the, fox, hunting, field, as, well, thoroughbreds, are, often, crossed, with, horses, of, other, breeds, to, create, new, breeds, or, to, enhance, or, introduce, specific, qualities, into, existing, ones, they, have, been, influential, on, many, modern, riding, horse, breeds, such, as, the, american, quarter, horse, the, standardbred, and, possibly, the, morgan, a, breed, that, went, on, to, influence, many, of, the, gaited, breeds, in, north, america, other, common, crosses, with, the, thoroughbred, include, crossbreeding, with, arabian, bloodlines, to, produce, the, anglo, arabian, as, well, as, with, the, irish, draught, to, produce, the, irish, sport, horse, thoroughbreds, have, been, foundation, bloodstock, for, various, warmblood, breeds, due, to, their, refinement, and, performance, capabilities, crossbred, horses, developed, from, thoroughbreds, informally, categorized, as, hot, bloods, because, of, temperament, crossed, on, sturdy, draft, horse, breeds, classified, as, cold, bloods, for, their, more, phlegmatic, temperament, are, known, as, warmbloods, which, are, commonly, seen, in, competitive, events, such, as, show, jumping, and, dressage, examples, include, the, dutch, warmblood, hanoverian, and, selle, fran, ais, some, warmblood, registries, note, the, percentage, of, thoroughbred, breeding, and, many, warmblood, breeds, have, an, open, stud, book, that, continues, to, allow, thoroughbred, crossbreeding, although, thoroughbreds, are, seen, in, the, hunter, jumper, world, and, in, other, disciplines, modern, thoroughbreds, are, primarily, bred, for, speed, and, racehorses, have, a, very, high, rate, of, accidents, as, well, as, other, health, problems, one, tenth, of, all, thoroughbreds, suffer, orthopedic, problems, including, fractures, current, estimates, indicate, that, there, are, 1, 5, career, ending, breakdowns, for, every, 1, 000, horses, starting, a, race, in, the, united, states, an, average, of, two, horses, per, day, the, state, of, california, reported, a, particularly, high, rate, of, injury, 3, 5, per, 1000, starts, other, countries, report, lower, rates, of, injury, with, the, united, kingdom, having, 0, 9, injuries, 1, 000, starts, 1990, 1999, and, the, courses, in, victoria, australia, producing, a, rate, of, 0, 44, injuries, 1, 000, starts, 1989, 2004, thoroughbreds, also, have, other, health, concerns, including, a, majority, of, animals, who, are, prone, to, bleeding, from, the, lungs, exercise, induced, pulmonary, hemorrhage, 10, with, low, fertility, and, 5, with, abnormally, small, hearts, thoroughbreds, also, tend, to, have, smaller, hooves, relative, to, their, body, mass, than, other, breeds, with, thin, soles, and, walls, and, a, lack, of, cartilage, mass, which, contributes, to, foot, soreness, the, most, common, source, of, lameness, in, racehorses, one, argument, for, the, health, issues, involving, thoroughbreds, suggests, that, inbreeding, is, the, culprit, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, capability, for, speed, is, enhanced, in, an, already, swift, animal, by, raising, muscle, mass, a, form, of, selective, breeding, that, has, created, animals, designed, to, win, horse, races, thus, according, to, one, postulation, the, modern, thoroughbred, travels, faster, than, its, skeletal, structure, can, support, veterinarian, robert, m, miller, states, that, we, have, selectively, bred, for, speeds, that, the, anatomy, of, the, horse, cannot, always, cope, with, poor, breeding, may, be, encouraged, by, the, fact, that, many, horses, are, sent, to, the, breeding, shed, following, an, injury, if, the, injury, is, linked, to, a, conformational, fault, the, fault, is, likely, to, be, passed, to, the, next, generation, additionally, some, breeders, will, have, a, veterinarian, perform, straightening, procedures, on, a, horse, with, crooked, legs, this, can, help, increase, the, horse, s, price, at, a, sale, and, perhaps, help, the, horse, have, a, sounder, racing, career, but, the, genes, for, poor, legs, will, still, be, passed, on, a, high, accident, rate, may, also, occur, because, thoroughbreds, particularly, in, the, united, states, are, first, raced, as, 2, year, olds, well, before, they, are, completely, mature, though, they, may, appear, full, grown, and, are, in, superb, muscular, condition, their, bones, are, not, fully, formed, however, catastrophic, injury, rates, are, higher, in, 4, and, 5, year, olds, than, in, 2, and, 3, year, olds, some, believe, that, correct, slow, training, of, a, young, horse, including, foals, may, actually, be, beneficial, to, the, overall, soundness, of, the, animal, this, is, because, during, the, training, process, microfractures, occur, in, the, leg, followed, by, bone, remodeling, if, the, remodeling, is, given, sufficient, time, to, heal, the, bone, becomes, stronger, if, proper, remodeling, occurs, before, hard, training, and, racing, begins, the, horse, will, have, a, stronger, musculoskeletal, system, and, will, have, a, decreased, chance, of, injury, studies, have, shown, that, track, surfaces, horseshoes, with, toe, grabs, use, of, certain, legal, medications, and, high, intensity, racing, schedules, may, also, contribute, to, a, high, injury, rate, one, promising, trend, is, the, development, of, synthetic, surfaces, for, racetracks, and, one, of, the, first, tracks, to, install, such, a, surface, turfway, park, in, florence, kentucky, saw, its, rate, of, fatal, breakdowns, drop, from, 24, in, 2004, 05, to, three, in, the, year, following, polytrack, installation, the, material, is, not, perfected, and, some, areas, report, problems, related, to, winter, weather, but, studies, are, continuing, the, level, of, treatment, given, to, injured, thoroughbreds, is, often, more, intensive, than, for, horses, of, lesser, financial, value, but, also, controversial, due, in, part, to, the, significant, challenges, in, treating, broken, bones, and, other, major, leg, injuries, leg, injuries, that, are, not, immediately, fatal, still, may, be, life, threatening, because, a, horse, s, weight, must, be, distributed, evenly, on, all, four, legs, to, prevent, circulatory, problems, laminitis, and, other, infections, if, a, horse, loses, the, use, of, one, leg, temporarily, there, is, the, risk, that, other, legs, will, break, down, during, the, recovery, period, because, they, are, carrying, an, abnormal, weight, load, while, horses, periodically, lie, down, for, brief, periods, of, time, a, horse, cannot, remain, lying, in, the, equivalent, of, a, human, s, bed, rest, because, of, the, risk, of, developing, sores, internal, damage, and, congestion, whenever, a, racing, accident, severely, injures, a, well, known, horse, such, as, the, major, leg, fractures, that, led, to, the, euthanization, of, 2006, kentucky, derby, winner, barbaro, or, 2008, kentucky, derby, runner, up, eight, belles, animal, rights, groups, have, denounced, the, thoroughbred, racing, industry, on, the, other, hand, advocates, of, racing, argue, that, without, horse, racing, far, less, funding, and, incentives, would, be, available, for, medical, and, biomechanical, research, on, horses, although, horse, racing, is, hazardous, veterinary, science, has, advanced, previously, hopeless, cases, can, now, be, treated, and, earlier, detection, through, advanced, imaging, techniques, like, scintigraphy, can, keep, at, risk, horses, off, the, track
