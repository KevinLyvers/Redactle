hemoglobin, haemoglobin, hb, or, hgb, is, a, protein, containing, iron, that, facilitates, the, transport, of, oxygen, in, red, blood, cells, almost, all, vertebrates, contain, hemoglobin, with, the, sole, exception, of, the, fish, family, channichthyidae, hemoglobin, in, the, blood, carries, oxygen, from, the, respiratory, organs, lungs, or, gills, to, the, other, tissues, of, the, body, where, it, releases, the, oxygen, to, enable, aerobic, respiration, which, powers, the, animal, s, metabolism, a, healthy, human, has, 12, to, 20, grams, of, hemoglobin, in, every, 100, ml, of, blood, hemoglobin, is, a, metalloprotein, a, chromoprotein, and, globulin, in, mammals, hemoglobin, makes, up, about, 96, of, a, red, blood, cell, s, dry, weight, excluding, water, and, around, 35, of, the, total, weight, including, water, hemoglobin, has, an, oxygen, binding, capacity, of, 1, 34, ml, of, o, 2, per, gram, which, increases, the, total, blood, oxygen, capacity, seventy, fold, compared, to, dissolved, oxygen, in, blood, plasma, alone, the, mammalian, hemoglobin, molecule, can, bind, and, transport, up, to, four, oxygen, molecules, hemoglobin, also, transports, other, gases, it, carries, off, some, of, the, body, s, respiratory, carbon, dioxide, about, 20, 25, of, the, total, as, carbaminohemoglobin, in, which, co, 2, binds, to, the, heme, protein, the, molecule, also, carries, the, important, regulatory, molecule, nitric, oxide, bound, to, a, thiol, group, in, the, globin, protein, releasing, it, at, the, same, time, as, oxygen, hemoglobin, is, also, found, in, other, cells, including, in, the, a9, dopaminergic, neurons, of, the, substantia, nigra, macrophages, alveolar, cells, lungs, retinal, pigment, epithelium, hepatocytes, mesangial, cells, of, the, kidney, endometrial, cells, cervical, cells, and, vaginal, epithelial, cells, in, these, tissues, hemoglobin, absorbs, unneeded, oxygen, as, an, antioxidant, and, regulates, iron, metabolism, excessive, glucose, in, the, blood, can, attach, to, hemoglobin, and, raise, the, level, of, hemoglobin, a1c, hemoglobin, and, hemoglobin, like, molecules, are, also, found, in, many, invertebrates, fungi, and, plants, in, these, organisms, hemoglobins, may, carry, oxygen, or, they, may, transport, and, regulate, other, small, molecules, and, ions, such, as, carbon, dioxide, nitric, oxide, hydrogen, sulfide, and, sulfide, a, variant, called, leghemoglobin, serves, to, scavenge, oxygen, away, from, anaerobic, systems, such, as, the, nitrogen, fixing, nodules, of, leguminous, plants, preventing, oxygen, poisoning, the, medical, condition, hemoglobinemia, a, form, of, anemia, is, caused, by, intravascular, hemolysis, in, which, hemoglobin, leaks, from, red, blood, cells, into, the, blood, plasma, in, 1825, johann, friedrich, engelhart, discovered, that, the, ratio, of, iron, to, protein, is, identical, in, the, hemoglobins, of, several, species, from, the, known, atomic, mass, of, iron, he, calculated, the, molecular, mass, of, hemoglobin, to, n, 16000, n, number, of, iron, atoms, per, hemoglobin, molecule, now, known, to, be, 4, the, first, determination, of, a, protein, s, molecular, mass, this, hasty, conclusion, drew, ridicule, from, colleagues, who, could, not, believe, that, any, molecule, could, be, so, large, however, gilbert, smithson, adair, confirmed, engelhart, s, results, in, 1925, by, measuring, the, osmotic, pressure, of, hemoglobin, solutions, although, blood, had, been, known, to, carry, oxygen, since, at, least, 1794, the, oxygen, carrying, property, of, hemoglobin, was, described, by, h, nefeld, in, 1840, in, 1851, german, physiologist, otto, funke, published, a, series, of, articles, in, which, he, described, growing, hemoglobin, crystals, by, successively, diluting, red, blood, cells, with, a, solvent, such, as, pure, water, alcohol, or, ether, followed, by, slow, evaporation, of, the, solvent, from, the, resulting, protein, solution, hemoglobin, s, reversible, oxygenation, was, described, a, few, years, later, by, felix, hoppe, seyler, with, the, development, of, x, ray, crystallography, it, became, possible, to, sequence, protein, structures, in, 1959, max, perutz, determined, the, molecular, structure, of, hemoglobin, for, this, work, he, shared, the, 1962, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, with, john, kendrew, who, sequenced, the, globular, protein, myoglobin, the, role, of, hemoglobin, in, the, blood, was, elucidated, by, french, physiologist, claude, bernard, the, name, hemoglobin, or, haemoglobin, is, derived, from, the, words, heme, or, haem, and, globin, reflecting, the, fact, that, each, subunit, of, hemoglobin, is, a, globular, protein, with, an, embedded, heme, group, each, heme, group, contains, one, iron, atom, that, can, bind, one, oxygen, molecule, through, ion, induced, dipole, forces, the, most, common, type, of, hemoglobin, in, mammals, contains, four, such, subunits, hemoglobin, consists, of, protein, subunits, globin, molecules, which, are, polypeptides, long, folded, chains, of, specific, amino, acids, which, determine, the, protein, s, chemical, properties, and, function, the, amino, acid, sequence, of, any, polypeptide, is, translated, from, a, segment, of, dna, the, corresponding, gene, there, is, more, than, one, hemoglobin, gene, in, humans, hemoglobin, a, the, main, form, of, hemoglobin, in, adults, is, coded, by, genes, hba1, hba2, and, hbb, alpha, 1, and, alpha, 2, subunits, are, respectively, coded, by, genes, hba1, and, hba2, close, together, on, chromosome, 16, while, the, beta, subunit, is, coded, by, gene, hbb, on, chromosome, 11, the, amino, acid, sequences, of, the, globin, subunits, usually, differ, between, species, with, the, difference, growing, with, evolutionary, distance, for, example, the, most, common, hemoglobin, sequences, in, humans, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, are, completely, identical, with, exactly, the, same, alpha, and, beta, globin, protein, chains, human, and, gorilla, hemoglobin, differ, in, one, amino, acid, in, both, alpha, and, beta, chains, and, these, differences, grow, larger, between, less, closely, related, species, mutations, in, the, genes, for, hemoglobin, can, result, in, variants, of, hemoglobin, within, a, single, species, although, one, sequence, is, usually, most, common, in, each, species, many, of, these, mutations, cause, no, disease, but, some, cause, a, group, of, hereditary, diseases, called, hemoglobinopathies, the, best, known, hemoglobinopathy, is, sickle, cell, disease, which, was, the, first, human, disease, whose, mechanism, was, understood, at, the, molecular, level, a, mostly, separate, set, of, diseases, called, thalassemias, involves, underproduction, of, normal, and, sometimes, abnormal, hemoglobins, through, problems, and, mutations, in, globin, gene, regulation, all, these, diseases, produce, anemia, variations, in, hemoglobin, sequences, as, with, other, proteins, may, be, adaptive, for, example, hemoglobin, has, been, found, to, adapt, in, different, ways, to, the, thin, air, at, high, altitudes, where, lower, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, diminishes, its, binding, to, hemoglobin, compared, to, the, higher, pressures, at, sea, level, recent, studies, of, deer, mice, found, mutations, in, four, genes, that, can, account, for, differences, between, high, and, low, elevation, populations, it, was, found, that, the, genes, of, the, two, breeds, are, virtually, identical, except, for, those, that, govern, the, oxygen, carrying, capacity, of, their, hemoglobin, the, genetic, difference, enables, highland, mice, to, make, more, efficient, use, of, their, oxygen, mammoth, hemoglobin, featured, mutations, that, allowed, for, oxygen, delivery, at, lower, temperatures, thus, enabling, mammoths, to, migrate, to, higher, latitudes, during, the, pleistocene, this, was, also, found, in, hummingbirds, that, inhabit, the, andes, hummingbirds, already, expend, a, lot, of, energy, and, thus, have, high, oxygen, demands, and, yet, andean, hummingbirds, have, been, found, to, thrive, in, high, altitudes, non, synonymous, mutations, in, the, hemoglobin, gene, of, multiple, species, living, at, high, elevations, oreotrochilus, a, castelnaudii, c, violifer, p, gigas, and, a, viridicuada, have, caused, the, protein, to, have, less, of, an, affinity, for, inositol, hexaphosphate, ihp, a, molecule, found, in, birds, that, has, a, similar, role, as, 2, 3, bpg, in, humans, this, results, in, the, ability, to, bind, oxygen, in, lower, partial, pressures, birds, unique, circulatory, lungs, also, promote, efficient, use, of, oxygen, at, low, partial, pressures, of, o, 2, these, two, adaptations, reinforce, each, other, and, account, for, birds, remarkable, high, altitude, performance, hemoglobin, adaptation, extends, to, humans, as, well, there, is, a, higher, offspring, survival, rate, among, tibetan, women, with, high, oxygen, saturation, genotypes, residing, at, 4, 000, m, natural, selection, seems, to, be, the, main, force, working, on, this, gene, because, the, mortality, rate, of, offspring, is, significantly, lower, for, women, with, higher, hemoglobin, oxygen, affinity, when, compared, to, the, mortality, rate, of, offspring, from, women, with, low, hemoglobin, oxygen, affinity, while, the, exact, genotype, and, mechanism, by, which, this, occurs, is, not, yet, clear, selection, is, acting, on, these, women, s, ability, to, bind, oxygen, in, low, partial, pressures, which, overall, allows, them, to, better, sustain, crucial, metabolic, processes, hemoglobin, hb, is, synthesized, in, a, complex, series, of, steps, the, heme, part, is, synthesized, in, a, series, of, steps, in, the, mitochondria, and, the, cytosol, of, immature, red, blood, cells, while, the, globin, protein, parts, are, synthesized, by, ribosomes, in, the, cytosol, production, of, hb, continues, in, the, cell, throughout, its, early, development, from, the, proerythroblast, to, the, reticulocyte, in, the, bone, marrow, at, this, point, the, nucleus, is, lost, in, mammalian, red, blood, cells, but, not, in, birds, and, many, other, species, even, after, the, loss, of, the, nucleus, in, mammals, residual, ribosomal, rna, allows, further, synthesis, of, hb, until, the, reticulocyte, loses, its, rna, soon, after, entering, the, vasculature, this, hemoglobin, synthetic, rna, in, fact, gives, the, reticulocyte, its, reticulated, appearance, and, name, hemoglobin, has, a, quaternary, structure, characteristic, of, many, multi, subunit, globular, proteins, most, of, the, amino, acids, in, hemoglobin, form, alpha, helices, and, these, helices, are, connected, by, short, non, helical, segments, hydrogen, bonds, stabilize, the, helical, sections, inside, this, protein, causing, attractions, within, the, molecule, which, then, causes, each, polypeptide, chain, to, fold, into, a, specific, shape, hemoglobin, s, quaternary, structure, comes, from, its, four, subunits, in, roughly, a, tetrahedral, arrangement, in, most, vertebrates, the, hemoglobin, molecule, is, an, assembly, of, four, globular, protein, subunits, each, subunit, is, composed, of, a, protein, chain, tightly, associated, with, a, non, protein, prosthetic, heme, group, each, protein, chain, arranges, into, a, set, of, alpha, helix, structural, segments, connected, together, in, a, globin, fold, arrangement, such, a, name, is, given, because, this, arrangement, is, the, same, folding, motif, used, in, other, heme, globin, proteins, such, as, myoglobin, this, folding, pattern, contains, a, pocket, that, strongly, binds, the, heme, group, a, heme, group, consists, of, an, iron, fe, ion, held, in, a, heterocyclic, ring, known, as, a, porphyrin, this, porphyrin, ring, consists, of, four, pyrrole, molecules, cyclically, linked, together, by, methine, bridges, with, the, iron, ion, bound, in, the, center, the, iron, ion, which, is, the, site, of, oxygen, binding, coordinates, with, the, four, nitrogen, atoms, in, the, center, of, the, ring, which, all, lie, in, one, plane, the, heme, is, bound, strongly, covalently, to, the, globular, protein, via, the, n, atoms, of, the, imidazole, ring, of, f8, histidine, residue, also, known, as, the, proximal, histidine, below, the, porphyrin, ring, a, sixth, position, can, reversibly, bind, oxygen, by, a, coordinate, covalent, bond, completing, the, octahedral, group, of, six, ligands, this, reversible, bonding, with, oxygen, is, why, hemoglobin, is, so, useful, for, transporting, oxygen, around, the, body, oxygen, binds, in, an, end, on, bent, geometry, where, one, oxygen, atom, binds, to, fe, and, the, other, protrudes, at, an, angle, when, oxygen, is, not, bound, a, very, weakly, bonded, water, molecule, fills, the, site, forming, a, distorted, octahedron, even, though, carbon, dioxide, is, carried, by, hemoglobin, it, does, not, compete, with, oxygen, for, the, iron, binding, positions, but, is, bound, to, the, amine, groups, of, the, protein, chains, attached, to, the, heme, groups, the, iron, ion, may, be, either, in, the, ferrous, fe, 2, or, in, the, ferric, fe, 3, state, but, ferrihemoglobin, methemoglobin, fe, 3, cannot, bind, oxygen, in, binding, oxygen, temporarily, and, reversibly, oxidizes, fe, 2, to, fe, 3, while, oxygen, temporarily, turns, into, the, superoxide, ion, thus, iron, must, exist, in, the, 2, oxidation, state, to, bind, oxygen, if, superoxide, ion, associated, to, fe, 3, is, protonated, the, hemoglobin, iron, will, remain, oxidized, and, incapable, of, binding, oxygen, in, such, cases, the, enzyme, methemoglobin, reductase, will, be, able, to, eventually, reactivate, methemoglobin, by, reducing, the, iron, center, in, adult, humans, the, most, common, hemoglobin, type, is, a, tetramer, which, contains, four, subunit, proteins, called, hemoglobin, a, consisting, of, two, and, two, subunits, non, covalently, bound, each, made, of, 141, and, 146, amino, acid, residues, respectively, this, is, denoted, as, 2, 2, the, subunits, are, structurally, similar, and, about, the, same, size, each, subunit, has, a, molecular, weight, of, about, 16, 000, daltons, for, a, total, molecular, weight, of, the, tetramer, of, about, 64, 000, daltons, 64, 458, g, mol, thus, 1, g, dl, 0, 1551, mmol, l, hemoglobin, a, is, the, most, intensively, studied, of, the, hemoglobin, molecules, in, human, infants, the, fetal, hemoglobin, molecule, is, made, up, of, 2, chains, and, 2, chains, the, chains, are, gradually, replaced, by, chains, as, the, infant, grows, the, four, polypeptide, chains, are, bound, to, each, other, by, salt, bridges, hydrogen, bonds, and, the, hydrophobic, effect, in, general, hemoglobin, can, be, saturated, with, oxygen, molecules, oxyhemoglobin, or, desaturated, with, oxygen, molecules, deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, is, formed, during, physiological, respiration, when, oxygen, binds, to, the, heme, component, of, the, protein, hemoglobin, in, red, blood, cells, this, process, occurs, in, the, pulmonary, capillaries, adjacent, to, the, alveoli, of, the, lungs, the, oxygen, then, travels, through, the, blood, stream, to, be, dropped, off, at, cells, where, it, is, utilized, as, a, terminal, electron, acceptor, in, the, production, of, atp, by, the, process, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, it, does, not, however, help, to, counteract, a, decrease, in, blood, ph, ventilation, or, breathing, may, reverse, this, condition, by, removal, of, carbon, dioxide, thus, causing, a, shift, up, in, ph, hemoglobin, exists, in, two, forms, a, taut, tense, form, t, and, a, relaxed, form, r, various, factors, such, as, low, ph, high, co, 2, and, high, 2, 3, bpg, at, the, level, of, the, tissues, favor, the, taut, form, which, has, low, oxygen, affinity, and, releases, oxygen, in, the, tissues, conversely, a, high, ph, low, co, 2, or, low, 2, 3, bpg, favors, the, relaxed, form, which, can, better, bind, oxygen, the, partial, pressure, of, the, system, also, affects, o, 2, affinity, where, at, high, partial, pressures, of, oxygen, such, as, those, present, in, the, alveoli, the, relaxed, high, affinity, r, state, is, favoured, inversely, at, low, partial, pressures, such, as, those, present, in, respiring, tissues, the, low, affinity, t, tense, state, is, favoured, additionally, the, binding, of, oxygen, to, the, iron, ii, heme, pulls, the, iron, into, the, plane, of, the, porphyrin, ring, causing, a, slight, conformational, shift, the, shift, encourages, oxygen, to, bind, to, the, three, remaining, heme, units, within, hemoglobin, thus, oxygen, binding, is, cooperative, classically, the, iron, in, oxyhemoglobin, is, seen, as, existing, in, the, iron, ii, oxidation, state, however, the, complex, of, oxygen, with, heme, iron, is, diamagnetic, whereas, both, oxygen, and, high, spin, iron, ii, are, paramagnetic, experimental, evidence, strongly, suggests, heme, iron, is, in, the, iron, iii, oxidation, state, in, oxyhemoglobin, with, the, oxygen, existing, as, superoxide, anion, o, 2, or, in, a, covalent, charge, transfer, complex, deoxygenated, hemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, is, the, form, of, hemoglobin, without, the, bound, oxygen, the, absorption, spectra, of, oxyhemoglobin, and, deoxyhemoglobin, differ, the, oxyhemoglobin, has, significantly, lower, absorption, of, the, 660, nm, wavelength, than, deoxyhemoglobin, while, at, 940, nm, its, absorption, is, slightly, higher, this, difference, is, used, for, the, measurement, of, the, amount, of, oxygen, in, a, patient, s, blood, by, an, instrument, called, a, pulse, oximeter, this, difference, also, accounts, for, the, presentation, of, cyanosis, the, blue, to, purplish, color, that, tissues, develop, during, hypoxia, deoxygenated, hemoglobin, is, paramagnetic, it, is, weakly, attracted, to, magnetic, fields, in, contrast, oxygenated, hemoglobin, exhibits, diamagnetism, a, weak, repulsion, from, a, magnetic, field, scientists, agree, that, the, event, that, separated, myoglobin, from, hemoglobin, occurred, after, lampreys, diverged, from, jawed, vertebrates, this, separation, of, myoglobin, and, hemoglobin, allowed, for, the, different, functions, of, the, two, molecules, to, arise, and, develop, myoglobin, has, more, to, do, with, oxygen, storage, while, hemoglobin, is, tasked, with, oxygen, transport, the, and, like, globin, genes, encode, the, individual, subunits, of, the, protein, the, predecessors, of, these, genes, arose, through, another, duplication, event, also, after, the, gnathosome, common, ancestor, derived, from, jawless, fish, approximately, 450, 500, million, years, ago, ancestral, reconstruction, studies, suggest, that, the, preduplication, ancestor, of, the, and, genes, was, a, dimer, made, up, of, identical, globin, subunits, which, then, evolved, to, assemble, into, a, tetrameric, architecture, after, the, duplication, the, development, of, and, genes, created, the, potential, for, hemoglobin, to, be, composed, of, multiple, distinct, subunits, a, physical, composition, central, to, hemoglobin, s, ability, to, transport, oxygen, having, multiple, subunits, contributes, to, hemoglobin, s, ability, to, bind, oxygen, cooperatively, as, well, as, be, regulated, allosterically, subsequently, the, gene, also, underwent, a, duplication, event, to, form, the, hba1, and, hba2, genes, these, further, duplications, and, divergences, have, created, a, diverse, range, of, and, like, globin, genes, that, are, regulated, so, that, certain, forms, occur, at, different, stages, of, development, most, ice, fish, of, the, family, channichthyidae, have, lost, their, hemoglobin, genes, as, an, adaptation, to, cold, water, when, oxygen, binds, to, the, iron, complex, it, causes, the, iron, atom, to, move, back, toward, the, center, of, the, plane, of, the, porphyrin, ring, see, moving, diagram, at, the, same, time, the, imidazole, side, chain, of, the, histidine, residue, interacting, at, the, other, pole, of, the, iron, is, pulled, toward, the, porphyrin, ring, this, interaction, forces, the, plane, of, the, ring, sideways, toward, the, outside, of, the, tetramer, and, also, induces, a, strain, in, the, protein, helix, containing, the, histidine, as, it, moves, nearer, to, the, iron, atom, this, strain, is, transmitted, to, the, remaining, three, monomers, in, the, tetramer, where, it, induces, a, similar, conformational, change, in, the, other, heme, sites, such, that, binding, of, oxygen, to, these, sites, becomes, easier, as, oxygen, binds, to, one, monomer, of, hemoglobin, the, tetramer, s, conformation, shifts, from, the, t, tense, state, to, the, r, relaxed, state, this, shift, promotes, the, binding, of, oxygen, to, the, remaining, three, monomers, heme, groups, thus, saturating, the, hemoglobin, molecule, with, oxygen, in, the, tetrameric, form, of, normal, adult, hemoglobin, the, binding, of, oxygen, is, thus, a, cooperative, process, the, binding, affinity, of, hemoglobin, for, oxygen, is, increased, by, the, oxygen, saturation, of, the, molecule, with, the, first, molecules, of, oxygen, bound, influencing, the, shape, of, the, binding, sites, for, the, next, ones, in, a, way, favorable, for, binding, this, positive, cooperative, binding, is, achieved, through, steric, conformational, changes, of, the, hemoglobin, protein, complex, as, discussed, above, i, e, when, one, subunit, protein, in, hemoglobin, becomes, oxygenated, a, conformational, or, structural, change, in, the, whole, complex, is, initiated, causing, the, other, subunits, to, gain, an, increased, affinity, for, oxygen, as, a, consequence, the, oxygen, binding, curve, of, hemoglobin, is, sigmoidal, or, s, shaped, as, opposed, to, the, normal, hyperbolic, curve, associated, with, noncooperative, binding, the, dynamic, mechanism, of, the, cooperativity, in, hemoglobin, and, its, relation, with, low, frequency, resonance, has, been, discussed, besides, the, oxygen, ligand, which, binds, to, hemoglobin, in, a, cooperative, manner, hemoglobin, ligands, also, include, competitive, inhibitors, such, as, carbon, monoxide, co, and, allosteric, ligands, such, as, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, nitric, oxide, no, the, carbon, dioxide, is, bound, to, amino, groups, of, the, globin, proteins, to, form, carbaminohemoglobin, this, mechanism, is, thought, to, account, for, about, 10, of, carbon, dioxide, transport, in, mammals, nitric, oxide, can, also, be, transported, by, hemoglobin, it, is, bound, to, specific, thiol, groups, in, the, globin, protein, to, form, an, s, nitrosothiol, which, dissociates, into, free, nitric, oxide, and, thiol, again, as, the, hemoglobin, releases, oxygen, from, its, heme, site, this, nitric, oxide, transport, to, peripheral, tissues, is, hypothesized, to, assist, oxygen, transport, in, tissues, by, releasing, vasodilatory, nitric, oxide, to, tissues, in, which, oxygen, levels, are, low, the, binding, of, oxygen, is, affected, by, molecules, such, as, carbon, monoxide, for, example, from, tobacco, smoking, exhaust, gas, and, incomplete, combustion, in, furnaces, co, competes, with, oxygen, at, the, heme, binding, site, hemoglobin, s, binding, affinity, for, co, is, 250, times, greater, than, its, affinity, for, oxygen, since, carbon, monoxide, is, a, colorless, odorless, and, tasteless, gas, and, poses, a, potentially, fatal, threat, carbon, monoxide, detectors, have, become, commercially, available, to, warn, of, dangerous, levels, in, residences, when, hemoglobin, combines, with, co, it, forms, a, very, bright, red, compound, called, carboxyhemoglobin, which, may, cause, the, skin, of, co, poisoning, victims, to, appear, pink, in, death, instead, of, white, or, blue, when, inspired, air, contains, co, levels, as, low, as, 0, 02, headache, and, nausea, occur, if, the, co, concentration, is, increased, to, 0, 1, unconsciousness, will, follow, in, heavy, smokers, up, to, 20, of, the, oxygen, active, sites, can, be, blocked, by, co, in, similar, fashion, hemoglobin, also, has, competitive, binding, affinity, for, cyanide, cn, sulfur, monoxide, so, and, sulfide, s, 2, including, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, all, of, these, bind, to, iron, in, heme, without, changing, its, oxidation, state, but, they, nevertheless, inhibit, oxygen, binding, causing, grave, toxicity, the, iron, atom, in, the, heme, group, must, initially, be, in, the, ferrous, fe, 2, oxidation, state, to, support, oxygen, and, other, gases, binding, and, transport, it, temporarily, switches, to, ferric, during, the, time, oxygen, is, bound, as, explained, above, initial, oxidation, to, the, ferric, fe, 3, state, without, oxygen, converts, hemoglobin, into, hem, i, globin, or, methemoglobin, which, cannot, bind, oxygen, hemoglobin, in, normal, red, blood, cells, is, protected, by, a, reduction, system, to, keep, this, from, happening, nitric, oxide, is, capable, of, converting, a, small, fraction, of, hemoglobin, to, methemoglobin, in, red, blood, cells, the, latter, reaction, is, a, remnant, activity, of, the, more, ancient, nitric, oxide, dioxygenase, function, of, globins, carbon, di, oxide, occupies, a, different, binding, site, on, the, hemoglobin, at, tissues, where, carbon, dioxide, concentration, is, higher, carbon, dioxide, binds, to, allosteric, site, of, hemoglobin, facilitating, unloading, of, oxygen, from, hemoglobin, and, ultimately, its, removal, from, the, body, after, the, oxygen, has, been, released, to, tissues, undergoing, metabolism, this, increased, affinity, for, carbon, dioxide, by, the, venous, blood, is, known, as, the, bohr, effect, through, the, enzyme, carbonic, anhydrase, carbon, dioxide, reacts, with, water, to, give, carbonic, acid, which, decomposes, into, bicarbonate, and, protons, hence, blood, with, high, carbon, dioxide, levels, is, also, lower, in, ph, more, acidic, hemoglobin, can, bind, protons, and, carbon, dioxide, which, causes, a, conformational, change, in, the, protein, and, facilitates, the, release, of, oxygen, protons, bind, at, various, places, on, the, protein, while, carbon, dioxide, binds, at, the, amino, group, carbon, dioxide, binds, to, hemoglobin, and, forms, carbaminohemoglobin, this, decrease, in, hemoglobin, s, affinity, for, oxygen, by, the, binding, of, carbon, dioxide, and, acid, is, known, as, the, bohr, effect, the, bohr, effect, favors, the, t, state, rather, than, the, r, state, shifts, the, o, 2, saturation, curve, to, the, right, conversely, when, the, carbon, dioxide, levels, in, the, blood, decrease, i, e, in, the, lung, capillaries, carbon, dioxide, and, protons, are, released, from, hemoglobin, increasing, the, oxygen, affinity, of, the, protein, a, reduction, in, the, total, binding, capacity, of, hemoglobin, to, oxygen, i, e, shifting, the, curve, down, not, just, to, the, right, due, to, reduced, ph, is, called, the, root, effect, this, is, seen, in, bony, fish, it, is, necessary, for, hemoglobin, to, release, the, oxygen, that, it, binds, if, not, there, is, no, point, in, binding, it, the, sigmoidal, curve, of, hemoglobin, makes, it, efficient, in, binding, taking, up, o, 2, in, lungs, and, efficient, in, unloading, unloading, o, 2, in, tissues, in, people, acclimated, to, high, altitudes, the, concentration, of, 2, 3, bisphosphoglycerate, 2, 3, bpg, in, the, blood, is, increased, which, allows, these, individuals, to, deliver, a, larger, amount, of, oxygen, to, tissues, under, conditions, of, lower, oxygen, tension, this, phenomenon, where, molecule, y, affects, the, binding, of, molecule, x, to, a, transport, molecule, z, is, called, a, heterotropic, allosteric, effect, hemoglobin, in, organisms, at, high, altitudes, has, also, adapted, such, that, it, has, less, of, an, affinity, for, 2, 3, bpg, and, so, the, protein, will, be, shifted, more, towards, its, r, state, in, its, r, state, hemoglobin, will, bind, oxygen, more, readily, thus, allowing, organisms, to, perform, the, necessary, metabolic, processes, when, oxygen, is, present, at, low, partial, pressures, animals, other, than, humans, use, different, molecules, to, bind, to, hemoglobin, and, change, its, o, 2, affinity, under, unfavorable, conditions, fish, use, both, atp, and, gtp, these, bind, to, a, phosphate, pocket, on, the, fish, hemoglobin, molecule, which, stabilizes, the, tense, state, and, therefore, decreases, oxygen, affinity, gtp, reduces, hemoglobin, oxygen, affinity, much, more, than, atp, which, is, thought, to, be, due, to, an, extra, hydrogen, bond, formed, that, further, stabilizes, the, tense, state, under, hypoxic, conditions, the, concentration, of, both, atp, and, gtp, is, reduced, in, fish, red, blood, cells, to, increase, oxygen, affinity, a, variant, hemoglobin, called, fetal, hemoglobin, hbf, 2, 2, is, found, in, the, developing, fetus, and, binds, oxygen, with, greater, affinity, than, adult, hemoglobin, this, means, that, the, oxygen, binding, curve, for, fetal, hemoglobin, is, left, shifted, i, e, a, higher, percentage, of, hemoglobin, has, oxygen, bound, to, it, at, lower, oxygen, tension, in, comparison, to, that, of, adult, hemoglobin, as, a, result, fetal, blood, in, the, placenta, is, able, to, take, oxygen, from, maternal, blood, hemoglobin, also, carries, nitric, oxide, no, in, the, globin, part, of, the, molecule, this, improves, oxygen, delivery, in, the, periphery, and, contributes, to, the, control, of, respiration, no, binds, reversibly, to, a, specific, cysteine, residue, in, globin, the, binding, depends, on, the, state, r, or, t, of, the, hemoglobin, the, resulting, s, nitrosylated, hemoglobin, influences, various, no, related, activities, such, as, the, control, of, vascular, resistance, blood, pressure, and, respiration, no, is, not, released, in, the, cytoplasm, of, red, blood, cells, but, transported, out, of, them, by, an, anion, exchanger, called, ae1, hemoglobin, variants, are, a, part, of, the, normal, embryonic, and, fetal, development, they, may, also, be, pathologic, mutant, forms, of, hemoglobin, in, a, population, caused, by, variations, in, genetics, some, well, known, hemoglobin, variants, such, as, sickle, cell, anemia, are, responsible, for, diseases, and, are, considered, hemoglobinopathies, other, variants, cause, no, detectable, pathology, and, are, thus, considered, non, pathological, variants, in, embryos, in, fetuses, in, neonates, newborns, inmmediately, after, birth, abnormal, forms, that, occur, in, diseases, when, red, blood, cells, reach, the, end, of, their, life, due, to, aging, or, defects, they, are, removed, from, the, circulation, by, the, phagocytic, activity, of, macrophages, in, the, spleen, or, the, liver, or, hemolyze, within, the, circulation, free, hemoglobin, is, then, cleared, from, the, circulation, via, the, hemoglobin, transporter, cd163, which, is, exclusively, expressed, on, monocytes, or, macrophages, within, these, cells, the, hemoglobin, molecule, is, broken, up, and, the, iron, gets, recycled, this, process, also, produces, one, molecule, of, carbon, monoxide, for, every, molecule, of, heme, degraded, heme, degradation, is, the, only, natural, source, of, carbon, monoxide, in, the, human, body, and, is, responsible, for, the, normal, blood, levels, of, carbon, monoxide, in, people, breathing, normal, air, the, other, major, final, product, of, heme, degradation, is, bilirubin, increased, levels, of, this, chemical, are, detected, in, the, blood, if, red, blood, cells, are, being, destroyed, more, rapidly, than, usual, improperly, degraded, hemoglobin, protein, or, hemoglobin, that, has, been, released, from, the, blood, cells, too, rapidly, can, clog, small, blood, vessels, especially, the, delicate, blood, filtering, vessels, of, the, kidneys, causing, kidney, damage, iron, is, removed, from, heme, and, salvaged, for, later, use, it, is, stored, as, hemosiderin, or, ferritin, in, tissues, and, transported, in, plasma, by, beta, globulins, as, transferrins, when, the, porphyrin, ring, is, broken, up, the, fragments, are, normally, secreted, as, a, yellow, pigment, called, bilirubin, which, is, secreted, into, the, intestines, as, bile, intestines, metabolize, bilirubin, into, urobilinogen, urobilinogen, leaves, the, body, in, faeces, in, a, pigment, called, stercobilin, globulin, is, metabolized, into, amino, acids, that, are, then, released, into, circulation, hemoglobin, deficiency, can, be, caused, either, by, a, decreased, amount, of, hemoglobin, molecules, as, in, anemia, or, by, decreased, ability, of, each, molecule, to, bind, oxygen, at, the, same, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, hemoglobinopathies, genetic, defects, resulting, in, abnormal, structure, of, the, hemoglobin, molecule, may, cause, both, in, any, case, hemoglobin, deficiency, decreases, blood, oxygen, carrying, capacity, hemoglobin, deficiency, is, in, general, strictly, distinguished, from, hypoxemia, defined, as, decreased, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, in, blood, although, both, are, causes, of, hypoxia, insufficient, oxygen, supply, to, tissues, other, common, causes, of, low, hemoglobin, include, loss, of, blood, nutritional, deficiency, bone, marrow, problems, chemotherapy, kidney, failure, or, abnormal, hemoglobin, such, as, that, of, sickle, cell, disease, the, ability, of, each, hemoglobin, molecule, to, carry, oxygen, is, normally, modified, by, altered, blood, ph, or, co, 2, causing, an, altered, oxygen, hemoglobin, dissociation, curve, however, it, can, also, be, pathologically, altered, in, e, g, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, decrease, of, hemoglobin, with, or, without, an, absolute, decrease, of, red, blood, cells, leads, to, symptoms, of, anemia, anemia, has, many, different, causes, although, iron, deficiency, and, its, resultant, iron, deficiency, anemia, are, the, most, common, causes, in, the, western, world, as, absence, of, iron, decreases, heme, synthesis, red, blood, cells, in, iron, deficiency, anemia, are, hypochromic, lacking, the, red, hemoglobin, pigment, and, microcytic, smaller, than, normal, other, anemias, are, rarer, in, hemolysis, accelerated, breakdown, of, red, blood, cells, associated, jaundice, is, caused, by, the, hemoglobin, metabolite, bilirubin, and, the, circulating, hemoglobin, can, cause, kidney, failure, some, mutations, in, the, globin, chain, are, associated, with, the, hemoglobinopathies, such, as, sickle, cell, disease, and, thalassemia, other, mutations, as, discussed, at, the, beginning, of, the, article, are, benign, and, are, referred, to, merely, as, hemoglobin, variants, there, is, a, group, of, genetic, disorders, known, as, the, porphyrias, that, are, characterized, by, errors, in, metabolic, pathways, of, heme, synthesis, king, george, iii, of, the, united, kingdom, was, probably, the, most, famous, porphyria, sufferer, to, a, small, extent, hemoglobin, a, slowly, combines, with, glucose, at, the, terminal, valine, an, alpha, aminoacid, of, each, chain, the, resulting, molecule, is, often, referred, to, as, hb, a, 1c, a, glycated, hemoglobin, the, binding, of, glucose, to, amino, acids, in, the, hemoglobin, takes, place, spontaneously, without, the, help, of, an, enzyme, in, many, proteins, and, is, not, known, to, serve, a, useful, purpose, however, as, the, concentration, of, glucose, in, the, blood, increases, the, percentage, of, hb, a, that, turns, into, hb, a, 1c, increases, in, diabetics, whose, glucose, usually, runs, high, the, percent, hb, a, 1c, also, runs, high, because, of, the, slow, rate, of, hb, a, combination, with, glucose, the, hb, a, 1c, percentage, reflects, a, weighted, average, of, blood, glucose, levels, over, the, lifetime, of, red, cells, which, is, approximately, 120, days, the, levels, of, glycated, hemoglobin, are, therefore, measured, in, order, to, monitor, the, long, term, control, of, the, chronic, disease, of, type, 2, diabetes, mellitus, t2dm, poor, control, of, t2dm, results, in, high, levels, of, glycated, hemoglobin, in, the, red, blood, cells, the, normal, reference, range, is, approximately, 4, 0, 5, 9, though, difficult, to, obtain, values, less, than, 7, are, recommended, for, people, with, t2dm, levels, greater, than, 9, are, associated, with, poor, control, of, the, glycated, hemoglobin, and, levels, greater, than, 12, are, associated, with, very, poor, control, diabetics, who, keep, their, glycated, hemoglobin, levels, close, to, 7, have, a, much, better, chance, of, avoiding, the, complications, that, may, accompany, diabetes, than, those, whose, levels, are, 8, or, higher, in, addition, increased, glycated, of, hemoglobin, increases, its, affinity, for, oxygen, therefore, preventing, its, release, at, the, tissue, and, inducing, a, level, of, hypoxia, in, extreme, cases, elevated, levels, of, hemoglobin, are, associated, with, increased, numbers, or, sizes, of, red, blood, cells, called, polycythemia, this, elevation, may, be, caused, by, congenital, heart, disease, cor, pulmonale, pulmonary, fibrosis, too, much, erythropoietin, or, polycythemia, vera, high, hemoglobin, levels, may, also, be, caused, by, exposure, to, high, altitudes, smoking, dehydration, artificially, by, concentrating, hb, advanced, lung, disease, and, certain, tumors, a, recent, study, done, in, pondicherry, india, shows, its, importance, in, coronary, artery, disease, hemoglobin, concentration, measurement, is, among, the, most, commonly, performed, blood, tests, usually, as, part, of, a, complete, blood, count, for, example, it, is, typically, tested, before, or, after, blood, donation, results, are, reported, in, g, l, g, dl, or, mol, l, 1, g, dl, equals, about, 0, 6206, mmol, l, although, the, latter, units, are, not, used, as, often, due, to, uncertainty, regarding, the, polymeric, state, of, the, molecule, this, conversion, factor, using, the, single, globin, unit, molecular, weight, of, 16, 000, da, is, more, common, for, hemoglobin, concentration, in, blood, for, mchc, mean, corpuscular, hemoglobin, concentration, the, conversion, factor, 0, 155, which, uses, the, tetramer, weight, of, 64, 500, da, is, more, common, normal, levels, are, normal, values, of, hemoglobin, in, the, 1st, and, 3rd, trimesters, of, pregnant, women, must, be, at, least, 11, g, dl, and, at, least, 10, 5, g, dl, during, the, 2nd, trimester, dehydration, or, hyperhydration, can, greatly, influence, measured, hemoglobin, levels, albumin, can, indicate, hydration, status, if, the, concentration, is, below, normal, this, is, called, anemia, anemias, are, classified, by, the, size, of, red, blood, cells, the, cells, that, contain, hemoglobin, in, vertebrates, the, anemia, is, called, microcytic, if, red, cells, are, small, macrocytic, if, they, are, large, and, normocytic, otherwise, hematocrit, the, proportion, of, blood, volume, occupied, by, red, blood, cells, is, typically, about, three, times, the, hemoglobin, concentration, measured, in, g, dl, for, example, if, the, hemoglobin, is, measured, at, 17, g, dl, that, compares, with, a, hematocrit, of, 51, laboratory, hemoglobin, test, methods, require, a, blood, sample, arterial, venous, or, capillary, and, analysis, on, hematology, analyzer, and, co, oximeter, additionally, a, new, noninvasive, hemoglobin, sphb, test, method, called, pulse, co, oximetry, is, also, available, with, comparable, accuracy, to, invasive, methods, concentrations, of, oxy, and, deoxyhemoglobin, can, be, measured, continuously, regionally, and, noninvasively, using, nirs, nirs, can, be, used, both, on, the, head, and, on, muscles, this, technique, is, often, used, for, research, in, e, g, elite, sports, training, ergonomics, rehabilitation, patient, monitoring, neonatal, research, functional, brain, monitoring, brain, computer, interface, urology, bladder, contraction, neurology, neurovascular, coupling, and, more, hemoglobin, mass, can, be, measured, in, humans, using, the, non, radioactive, carbon, monoxide, co, rebreathing, technique, that, has, been, used, for, more, than, 100, years, with, this, technique, a, small, volume, of, pure, co, gas, is, inhaled, and, rebreathed, for, a, few, minutes, during, rebreathing, co, binds, to, hemoglobin, present, in, red, blood, cells, based, on, the, increase, in, blood, co, after, the, rebreathing, period, the, hemoglobin, mass, can, be, determined, through, the, dilution, principle, although, co, gas, in, large, volumes, is, toxic, to, humans, the, volume, of, co, used, to, assess, blood, volumes, corresponds, to, what, would, be, inhaled, when, smoking, a, cigarette, while, researchers, typically, use, custom, made, rebreathing, circuits, the, detalo, performance, from, detalo, health, has, automated, the, procedure, and, made, the, measurement, available, to, a, larger, group, of, users, long, term, control, of, blood, sugar, concentration, can, be, measured, by, the, concentration, of, hb, a, 1c, measuring, it, directly, would, require, many, samples, because, blood, sugar, levels, vary, widely, through, the, day, hb, a, 1c, is, the, product, of, the, irreversible, reaction, of, hemoglobin, a, with, glucose, a, higher, glucose, concentration, results, in, more, hb, a, 1c, because, the, reaction, is, slow, the, hb, a, 1c, proportion, represents, glucose, level, in, blood, averaged, over, the, half, life, of, red, blood, cells, is, typically, 120, days, an, hb, a, 1c, proportion, of, 6, 0, or, less, show, good, long, term, glucose, control, while, values, above, 7, 0, are, elevated, this, test, is, especially, useful, for, diabetics, the, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, machine, uses, the, signal, from, deoxyhemoglobin, which, is, sensitive, to, magnetic, fields, since, it, is, paramagnetic, combined, measurement, with, nirs, shows, good, correlation, with, both, the, oxy, and, deoxyhemoglobin, signal, compared, to, the, bold, signal, hemoglobin, can, be, tracked, noninvasively, to, build, an, individual, data, set, tracking, the, hemoconcentration, and, hemodilution, effects, of, daily, activities, for, better, understanding, of, sports, performance, and, training, athletes, are, often, concerned, about, endurance, and, intensity, of, exercise, the, sensor, uses, light, emitting, diodes, that, emit, red, and, infrared, light, through, the, tissue, to, a, light, detector, which, then, sends, a, signal, to, a, processor, to, calculate, the, absorption, of, light, by, the, hemoglobin, protein, this, sensor, is, similar, to, a, pulse, oximeter, which, consists, of, a, small, sensing, device, that, clips, to, the, finger, a, variety, of, oxygen, transport, and, binding, proteins, exist, in, organisms, throughout, the, animal, and, plant, kingdoms, organisms, including, bacteria, protozoans, and, fungi, all, have, hemoglobin, like, proteins, whose, known, and, predicted, roles, include, the, reversible, binding, of, gaseous, ligands, since, many, of, these, proteins, contain, globins, and, the, heme, moiety, iron, in, a, flat, porphyrin, support, they, are, often, called, hemoglobins, even, if, their, overall, tertiary, structure, is, very, different, from, that, of, vertebrate, hemoglobin, in, particular, the, distinction, of, myoglobin, and, hemoglobin, in, lower, animals, is, often, impossible, because, some, of, these, organisms, do, not, contain, muscles, or, they, may, have, a, recognizable, separate, circulatory, system, but, not, one, that, deals, with, oxygen, transport, for, example, many, insects, and, other, arthropods, in, all, these, groups, heme, globin, containing, molecules, even, monomeric, globin, ones, that, deal, with, gas, binding, are, referred, to, as, oxyhemoglobins, in, addition, to, dealing, with, transport, and, sensing, of, oxygen, they, may, also, deal, with, no, co, 2, sulfide, compounds, and, even, o, 2, scavenging, in, environments, that, must, be, anaerobic, they, may, even, deal, with, detoxification, of, chlorinated, materials, in, a, way, analogous, to, heme, containing, p450, enzymes, and, peroxidases, the, structure, of, hemoglobins, varies, across, species, hemoglobin, occurs, in, all, kingdoms, of, organisms, but, not, in, all, organisms, primitive, species, such, as, bacteria, protozoa, algae, and, plants, often, have, single, globin, hemoglobins, many, nematode, worms, molluscs, and, crustaceans, contain, very, large, multisubunit, molecules, much, larger, than, those, in, vertebrates, in, particular, chimeric, hemoglobins, found, in, fungi, and, giant, annelids, may, contain, both, globin, and, other, types, of, proteins, one, of, the, most, striking, occurrences, and, uses, of, hemoglobin, in, organisms, is, in, the, giant, tube, worm, riftia, pachyptila, also, called, vestimentifera, which, can, reach, 2, 4, meters, length, and, populates, ocean, volcanic, vents, instead, of, a, digestive, tract, these, worms, contain, a, population, of, bacteria, constituting, half, the, organism, s, weight, the, bacteria, oxidize, h, 2, s, from, the, vent, with, o, 2, from, the, water, to, produce, energy, to, make, food, from, h, 2, o, and, co, 2, the, worms, upper, end, is, a, deep, red, fan, like, structure, plume, which, extends, into, the, water, and, absorbs, h, 2, s, and, o, 2, for, the, bacteria, and, co, 2, for, use, as, synthetic, raw, material, similar, to, photosynthetic, plants, the, structures, are, bright, red, due, to, their, content, of, several, extraordinarily, complex, hemoglobins, that, have, up, to, 144, globin, chains, each, including, associated, heme, structures, these, hemoglobins, are, remarkable, for, being, able, to, carry, oxygen, in, the, presence, of, sulfide, and, even, to, carry, sulfide, without, being, completely, poisoned, or, inhibited, by, it, as, hemoglobins, in, most, other, species, are, some, nonerythroid, cells, i, e, cells, other, than, the, red, blood, cell, line, contain, hemoglobin, in, the, brain, these, include, the, a9, dopaminergic, neurons, in, the, substantia, nigra, astrocytes, in, the, cerebral, cortex, and, hippocampus, and, in, all, mature, oligodendrocytes, it, has, been, suggested, that, brain, hemoglobin, in, these, cells, may, enable, the, storage, of, oxygen, to, provide, a, homeostatic, mechanism, in, anoxic, conditions, which, is, especially, important, for, a9, da, neurons, that, have, an, elevated, metabolism, with, a, high, requirement, for, energy, production, it, has, been, noted, further, that, a9, dopaminergic, neurons, may, be, at, particular, risk, of, anoxic, degeneration, since, in, addition, to, their, high, mitochondrial, activity, they, are, under, intense, oxidative, stress, caused, by, the, production, of, hydrogen, peroxide, via, autoxidation, and, or, monoamine, oxidase, mao, mediated, deamination, of, dopamine, and, the, subsequent, reaction, of, accessible, ferrous, iron, to, generate, highly, toxic, hydroxyl, radicals, this, may, explain, the, risk, of, degeneration, of, these, cells, in, parkinson, s, disease, the, hemoglobin, derived, iron, in, these, cells, is, not, the, cause, of, the, post, mortem, darkness, of, these, cells, origin, of, the, latin, name, substantia, nigra, but, rather, is, due, to, neuromelanin, outside, the, brain, hemoglobin, has, non, oxygen, carrying, functions, as, an, antioxidant, and, a, regulator, of, iron, metabolism, in, macrophages, alveolar, cells, and, mesangial, cells, in, the, kidney, historically, an, association, between, the, color, of, blood, and, rust, occurs, in, the, association, of, the, planet, mars, with, the, roman, god, of, war, since, the, planet, is, an, orange, red, which, reminded, the, ancients, of, blood, although, the, color, of, the, planet, is, due, to, iron, compounds, in, combination, with, oxygen, in, the, martian, soil, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, the, iron, in, hemoglobin, and, its, oxides, gives, blood, its, red, color, the, color, is, actually, due, to, the, porphyrin, moiety, of, hemoglobin, to, which, the, iron, is, bound, not, the, iron, itself, although, the, ligation, and, redox, state, of, the, iron, can, influence, the, pi, to, pi, or, n, to, pi, electronic, transitions, of, the, porphyrin, and, hence, its, optical, characteristics, artist, julian, voss, andreae, created, a, sculpture, called, heart, of, steel, hemoglobin, in, 2005, based, on, the, protein, s, backbone, the, sculpture, was, made, from, glass, and, weathering, steel, the, intentional, rusting, of, the, initially, shiny, work, of, art, mirrors, hemoglobin, s, fundamental, chemical, reaction, of, oxygen, binding, to, iron, montreal, artist, nicolas, baier, created, lustre, h, moglobine, a, sculpture, in, stainless, steel, that, shows, the, structure, of, the, hemoglobin, molecule, it, is, displayed, in, the, atrium, of, mcgill, university, health, centre, s, research, centre, in, montreal, the, sculpture, measures, about, 10, metres, 10, metres, 10, metres
