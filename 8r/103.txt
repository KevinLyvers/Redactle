the, integumentary, system, is, the, set, of, organs, forming, the, outermost, layer, of, an, animal, s, body, it, comprises, the, skin, and, its, appendages, which, act, as, a, physical, barrier, between, the, external, environment, and, the, internal, environment, that, it, serves, to, protect, and, maintain, the, body, of, the, animal, mainly, it, is, the, body, s, outer, skin, the, integumentary, system, includes, skin, hair, scales, feathers, hooves, claws, and, nails, it, has, a, variety, of, additional, functions, it, may, serve, to, maintain, water, balance, protect, the, deeper, tissues, excrete, wastes, and, regulate, body, temperature, and, is, the, attachment, site, for, sensory, receptors, which, detect, pain, sensation, pressure, and, temperature, the, skin, is, one, of, the, largest, organs, of, the, body, in, humans, it, accounts, for, about, 12, to, 15, percent, of, total, body, weight, and, covers, 1, 5, to, 2, m, 2, of, surface, area, the, skin, integument, is, a, composite, organ, made, up, of, at, least, two, major, layers, of, tissue, the, epidermis, and, the, dermis, the, epidermis, is, the, outermost, layer, providing, the, initial, barrier, to, the, external, environment, it, is, separated, from, the, dermis, by, the, basement, membrane, basal, lamina, and, reticular, lamina, the, epidermis, contains, melanocytes, and, gives, color, to, the, skin, the, deepest, layer, of, the, epidermis, also, contains, nerve, endings, beneath, this, the, dermis, comprises, two, sections, the, papillary, and, reticular, layers, and, contains, connective, tissues, vessels, glands, follicles, hair, roots, sensory, nerve, endings, and, muscular, tissue, between, the, integument, and, the, deep, body, musculature, there, is, a, transitional, subcutaneous, zone, made, up, of, very, loose, connective, and, adipose, tissue, the, hypodermis, substantial, collagen, bundles, anchor, the, dermis, to, the, hypodermis, in, a, way, that, permits, most, areas, of, the, skin, to, move, freely, over, the, deeper, tissue, layers, the, epidermis, is, the, strong, superficial, layer, that, serves, as, the, first, line, of, protection, against, the, outer, environment, the, human, epidermis, is, composed, of, stratified, squamous, epithelial, cells, which, further, break, down, into, four, to, five, layers, the, stratum, corneum, stratum, granulosum, stratum, spinosum, and, stratum, basale, where, the, skin, is, thicker, such, as, in, the, palms, and, soles, there, is, an, extra, layer, of, skin, between, the, stratum, corneum, and, the, stratum, granulosum, called, the, stratum, lucidum, the, epidermis, is, regenerated, from, the, stem, cells, found, in, the, basal, layer, that, develop, into, the, corneum, the, epidermis, itself, is, devoid, of, blood, supply, and, draws, its, nutrition, from, its, underlying, dermis, its, main, functions, are, protection, absorption, of, nutrients, and, homeostasis, in, structure, it, consists, of, a, keratinized, stratified, squamous, epithelium, four, types, of, cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes, merkel, cells, and, langerhans, cells, the, predominant, cell, keratinocyte, which, produces, keratin, a, fibrous, protein, that, aids, in, skin, protection, is, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, epidermal, water, barrier, by, making, and, secreting, lipids, the, majority, of, the, skin, on, the, human, body, is, keratinized, with, the, exception, of, the, lining, of, mucous, membranes, such, as, the, inside, of, the, mouth, non, keratinized, cells, allow, water, to, stay, atop, the, structure, the, protein, keratin, stiffens, epidermal, tissue, to, form, fingernails, nails, grow, from, a, thin, area, called, the, nail, matrix, at, an, average, of, 1, mm, per, week, the, lunula, is, the, crescent, shape, area, at, the, base, of, the, nail, lighter, in, color, as, it, mixes, with, matrix, cells, only, primates, have, nails, in, other, vertebrates, the, keratinizing, system, at, the, terminus, of, each, digit, produces, claws, or, hooves, the, epidermis, of, vertebrates, is, surrounded, by, two, kinds, of, coverings, which, are, produced, by, the, epidermis, itself, in, fish, and, aquatic, amphibians, it, is, a, thin, mucus, layer, that, is, constantly, being, replaced, in, terrestrial, vertebrates, it, is, the, stratum, corneum, dead, keratinized, cells, the, epidermis, is, to, some, degree, glandular, in, all, vertebrates, but, more, so, in, fish, and, amphibians, multicellular, epidermal, glands, penetrate, the, dermis, where, they, are, surrounded, by, blood, capillaries, that, provide, nutrients, and, in, the, case, of, endocrine, glands, transport, their, products, the, dermis, is, the, underlying, connective, tissue, layer, that, supports, the, epidermis, it, is, composed, of, dense, irregular, connective, tissue, and, areolar, connective, tissue, such, as, a, collagen, with, elastin, arranged, in, a, diffusely, bundled, and, woven, pattern, the, dermis, has, two, layers, the, papillary, dermis, and, the, reticular, layer, the, papillary, layer, is, the, superficial, layer, that, forms, finger, like, projections, into, the, epidermis, dermal, papillae, and, consists, of, highly, vascularized, loose, connective, tissue, the, reticular, layer, is, the, deep, layer, of, the, dermis, and, consists, of, the, dense, irregular, connective, tissue, these, layers, serve, to, give, elasticity, to, the, integument, allowing, stretching, and, conferring, flexibility, while, also, resisting, distortions, wrinkling, and, sagging, the, dermal, layer, provides, a, site, for, the, endings, of, blood, vessels, and, nerves, many, chromatophores, are, also, stored, in, this, layer, as, are, the, bases, of, integumental, structures, such, as, hair, feathers, and, glands, the, hypodermis, otherwise, known, as, the, subcutaneous, layer, is, a, layer, beneath, the, skin, it, invaginates, into, the, dermis, and, is, attached, to, the, latter, immediately, above, it, by, collagen, and, elastin, fibers, it, is, essentially, composed, of, a, type, of, cell, known, as, adipocytes, which, are, specialized, in, accumulating, and, storing, fats, these, cells, are, grouped, together, in, lobules, separated, by, connective, tissue, the, hypodermis, acts, as, an, energy, reserve, the, fats, contained, in, the, adipocytes, can, be, put, back, into, circulation, via, the, venous, route, during, intense, effort, or, when, there, is, a, lack, of, energy, providing, substances, and, are, then, transformed, into, energy, the, hypodermis, participates, passively, at, least, in, thermoregulation, since, fat, is, a, heat, insulator, the, integumentary, system, has, multiple, roles, in, maintaining, the, body, s, equilibrium, all, body, systems, work, in, an, interconnected, manner, to, maintain, the, internal, conditions, essential, to, the, function, of, the, body, the, skin, has, an, important, job, of, protecting, the, body, and, acts, as, the, body, s, first, line, of, defense, against, infection, temperature, change, and, other, challenges, to, homeostasis, its, main, functions, include, small, bodied, invertebrates, of, aquatic, or, continually, moist, habitats, respire, using, the, outer, layer, integument, this, gas, exchange, system, where, gases, simply, diffuse, into, and, out, of, the, interstitial, fluid, is, called, integumentary, exchange, possible, diseases, and, injuries, to, the, human, integumentary, system, include
