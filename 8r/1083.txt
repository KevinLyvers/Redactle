common, wheat, triticum, aestivum, also, known, as, bread, wheat, is, a, cultivated, wheat, species, about, 95, of, wheat, produced, worldwide, is, common, wheat, it, is, the, most, widely, grown, of, all, crops, and, the, cereal, with, the, highest, monetary, yield, numerous, forms, of, wheat, have, evolved, under, human, selection, this, diversity, has, led, to, confusion, in, the, naming, of, wheats, with, names, based, on, both, genetic, and, morphological, characteristics, bread, wheat, is, an, allohexaploid, a, combination, of, six, sets, of, chromosomes, from, different, species, of, the, six, sets, of, chromosomes, four, come, from, emmer, triticum, turgidum, itself, a, tetraploid, and, two, from, aegilops, tauschii, a, wild, diploid, goatgrass, wild, emmer, arose, from, an, even, earlier, ploidy, event, a, tetraploidy, between, two, diploids, wild, einkorn, t, urartu, and, a, speltoides, another, wild, goatgrass, free, threshing, wheat, is, closely, related, to, spelt, as, with, spelt, genes, contributed, from, aegilops, tauschii, give, bread, wheat, greater, cold, hardiness, than, most, wheats, and, it, is, cultivated, throughout, the, world, s, temperate, regions, common, wheat, was, first, domesticated, in, west, asia, during, the, early, holocene, and, spread, from, there, to, north, africa, europe, and, east, asia, in, the, prehistoric, period, naked, wheats, including, triticum, aestivum, t, durum, and, t, turgidum, were, found, in, roman, burial, sites, ranging, from, 100bce, to, 300ce, wheat, first, reached, north, america, with, spanish, missions, in, the, 16th, century, but, north, america, s, role, as, a, major, exporter, of, grain, dates, from, the, colonization, of, the, prairies, in, the, 1870s, as, grain, exports, from, russia, ceased, in, the, world, war, i, grain, production, in, kansas, doubled, worldwide, bread, wheat, has, proved, well, adapted, to, modern, industrial, baking, and, has, displaced, many, of, the, other, wheat, barley, and, rye, species, that, were, once, commonly, used, for, bread, making, particularly, in, europe, modern, wheat, varieties, have, been, selected, for, short, stems, the, result, of, rht, dwarfing, genes, that, reduce, the, plant, s, sensitivity, to, gibberellic, acid, a, plant, hormone, that, lengthens, cells, rht, genes, were, introduced, to, modern, wheat, varieties, in, the, 1960s, by, norman, borlaug, from, norin, 10, cultivars, of, wheat, grown, in, japan, short, stems, are, important, because, the, application, of, high, levels, of, chemical, fertilizers, would, otherwise, cause, the, stems, to, grow, too, high, resulting, in, lodging, collapse, of, the, stems, stem, heights, are, also, even, which, is, important, for, modern, harvesting, techniques, compact, wheats, e, g, club, wheat, triticum, compactum, but, in, india, t, sphaerococcum, are, closely, related, to, common, wheat, but, have, a, much, more, compact, ear, their, shorter, rachis, segments, lead, to, spikelets, packed, closer, together, compact, wheats, are, often, regarded, as, subspecies, rather, than, species, in, their, own, right, thus, t, aestivum, subsp, compactum
