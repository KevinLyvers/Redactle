a, banana, is, an, elongated, edible, fruit, botanically, a, berry, produced, by, several, kinds, of, large, herbaceous, flowering, plants, in, the, genus, musa, in, some, countries, cooking, bananas, are, called, plantains, distinguishing, them, from, dessert, bananas, the, fruit, is, variable, in, size, color, and, firmness, but, is, usually, elongated, and, curved, with, soft, flesh, rich, in, starch, covered, with, a, peel, which, may, have, a, variety, of, colors, when, ripe, it, grows, upward, in, clusters, near, the, top, of, the, plant, almost, all, modern, edible, seedless, parthenocarp, cultivated, bananas, come, from, two, wild, species, musa, acuminata, and, musa, balbisiana, or, hybrids, of, them, musa, species, are, native, to, tropical, indomalaya, and, australia, they, were, probably, domesticated, in, new, guinea, they, are, grown, in, 135, countries, primarily, for, their, fruit, and, to, a, lesser, extent, to, make, banana, paper, and, textiles, while, some, are, grown, as, ornamental, plants, the, world, s, largest, producers, of, bananas, in, 2022, were, india, and, china, which, together, accounted, for, approximately, 26, of, total, production, bananas, are, eaten, raw, or, cooked, in, recipes, varying, from, curries, to, banana, chips, fritters, fruit, preserves, or, simply, baked, or, steamed, worldwide, there, is, no, sharp, distinction, between, dessert, bananas, and, cooking, plantains, this, works, well, enough, in, the, americas, and, europe, but, it, breaks, down, in, southeast, asia, where, many, more, kinds, of, bananas, are, grown, and, eaten, the, term, banana, is, applied, also, to, other, members, of, the, genus, musa, such, as, the, scarlet, banana, musa, coccinea, the, pink, banana, musa, velutina, and, the, fe, i, bananas, members, of, the, genus, ensete, such, as, the, snow, banana, ensete, glaucum, and, the, economically, important, false, banana, ensete, ventricosum, of, africa, are, sometimes, included, both, genera, are, in, the, banana, family, musaceae, banana, plantations, are, subject, to, damage, by, parasitic, nematodes, and, insect, pests, and, to, fungal, and, bacterial, diseases, one, of, the, most, serious, being, panama, disease, which, is, caused, by, a, fusarium, fungus, this, and, black, sigatoka, threaten, the, production, of, cavendish, bananas, the, main, kind, eaten, in, the, western, world, which, is, a, triploid, musa, acuminata, plant, breeders, are, seeking, new, varieties, but, these, are, difficult, to, breed, given, that, commercial, varieties, are, seedless, to, enable, future, breeding, banana, germplasm, is, conserved, in, multiple, gene, banks, around, the, world, the, banana, plant, is, the, largest, herbaceous, flowering, plant, all, the, above, ground, parts, of, a, banana, plant, grow, from, a, structure, called, a, corm, plants, are, normally, tall, and, fairly, sturdy, with, a, treelike, appearance, but, what, appears, to, be, a, trunk, is, actually, a, pseudostem, composed, of, multiple, leaf, stalks, petioles, bananas, grow, in, a, wide, variety, of, soils, as, long, as, it, is, at, least, 60, centimetres, 2, 0, ft, deep, has, good, drainage, and, is, not, compacted, they, are, fast, growing, plants, with, a, growth, rate, of, up, to, 1, 6, metres, 5, 2, ft, per, day, the, leaves, of, banana, plants, are, composed, of, a, stalk, petiole, and, a, blade, lamina, the, base, of, the, petiole, widens, to, form, a, sheath, the, tightly, packed, sheaths, make, up, the, pseudostem, which, is, all, that, supports, the, plant, the, edges, of, the, sheath, meet, when, it, is, first, produced, making, it, tubular, as, new, growth, occurs, in, the, centre, of, the, pseudostem, the, edges, are, forced, apart, cultivated, banana, plants, vary, in, height, depending, on, the, variety, and, growing, conditions, most, are, around, 5, m, 16, ft, tall, with, a, range, from, dwarf, cavendish, plants, at, around, 3, m, 10, ft, to, gros, michel, at, 7, m, 23, ft, or, more, leaves, are, spirally, arranged, and, may, grow, 2, 7, metres, 8, 9, ft, long, and, 60, cm, 2, 0, ft, wide, when, a, banana, plant, is, mature, the, corm, stops, producing, new, leaves, and, begins, to, form, a, flower, spike, or, inflorescence, a, stem, develops, which, grows, up, inside, the, pseudostem, carrying, the, immature, inflorescence, until, eventually, it, emerges, at, the, top, each, pseudostem, normally, produces, a, single, inflorescence, also, known, as, the, banana, heart, after, fruiting, the, pseudostem, dies, but, offshoots, will, normally, have, developed, from, the, base, so, that, the, plant, as, a, whole, is, perennial, the, inflorescence, contains, many, petal, like, bracts, between, rows, of, flowers, the, female, flowers, which, can, develop, into, fruit, appear, in, rows, further, up, the, stem, closer, to, the, leaves, from, the, rows, of, male, flowers, the, ovary, is, inferior, meaning, that, the, tiny, petals, and, other, flower, parts, appear, at, the, tip, of, the, ovary, the, banana, fruits, develop, from, the, banana, heart, in, a, large, hanging, cluster, called, a, bunch, made, up, of, around, nine, tiers, called, hands, with, up, to, 20, fruits, to, a, hand, a, bunch, can, weigh, 22, 65, kilograms, 49, 143, lb, the, fruit, has, been, described, as, a, leathery, berry, there, is, a, protective, outer, layer, a, peel, or, skin, with, numerous, long, thin, strings, vascular, bundles, which, run, lengthwise, between, the, skin, and, the, edible, inner, portion, the, inner, part, of, the, common, yellow, dessert, variety, can, be, split, lengthwise, into, three, sections, that, correspond, to, the, inner, portions, of, the, three, carpels, by, manually, deforming, the, unopened, fruit, in, cultivated, varieties, fertile, seeds, are, usually, absent, a, 2011, phylogenomic, analysis, using, nuclear, genes, indicates, the, phylogeny, of, some, representatives, of, the, musaceae, family, major, edible, kinds, of, banana, are, shown, in, boldface, musa, acuminata, ssp, burmannica, banana, s, india, to, cambodia, musa, ornata, flowering, banana, of, southeast, asia, musa,

work, by, li, and, colleagues, in, 2024, identifies, three, subspecies, of, m, acuminata, namely, sspp, banksii, malaccensis, and, zebrina, as, contributing, substantially, to, the, ban, dh, and, ze, subgenomes, of, triploid, cultivated, bananas, respectively, the, genus, musa, was, created, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1753, the, name, may, be, derived, from, antonius, musa, physician, to, the, emperor, augustus, or, linnaeus, may, have, adapted, the, arabic, word, for, banana, mauz, the, ultimate, origin, of, musa, may, be, in, the, trans, new, guinea, languages, which, have, words, similar, to, muku, from, there, the, name, was, borrowed, into, the, austronesian, languages, and, across, asia, accompanying, the, cultivation, of, the, banana, as, it, was, brought, to, new, areas, via, the, dravidian, languages, of, india, into, arabic, as, a, wanderwort, the, word, banana, is, thought, to, be, of, west, african, origin, possibly, from, the, wolof, word, banaana, and, passed, into, english, via, spanish, or, portuguese, musa, is, the, type, genus, in, the, family, musaceae, the, apg, iii, system, assigns, musaceae, to, the, order, zingiberales, part, of, the, commelinid, clade, of, the, monocotyledonous, flowering, plants, some, 70, species, of, musa, were, recognized, by, the, world, checklist, of, selected, plant, families, as, of, january, 2013, several, produce, edible, fruit, while, others, are, cultivated, as, ornamentals, the, classification, of, cultivated, bananas, has, long, been, a, problematic, issue, for, taxonomists, linnaeus, originally, placed, bananas, into, two, species, based, only, on, their, uses, as, food, musa, sapientum, for, dessert, bananas, and, musa, paradisiaca, for, plantains, more, species, names, were, added, but, this, approach, proved, to, be, inadequate, for, the, number, of, cultivars, in, the, primary, center, of, diversity, of, the, genus, southeast, asia, many, of, these, cultivars, were, given, names, that, were, later, discovered, to, be, synonyms, in, a, series, of, papers, published, from, 1947, onward, ernest, cheesman, showed, that, linnaeus, s, musa, sapientum, and, musa, paradisiaca, were, cultivars, and, descendants, of, two, wild, seed, producing, species, musa, acuminata, and, musa, balbisiana, both, first, described, by, luigi, aloysius, colla, cheesman, recommended, the, abolition, of, linnaeus, s, species, in, favor, of, reclassifying, bananas, according, to, three, morphologically, distinct, groups, of, cultivars, those, primarily, exhibiting, the, botanical, characteristics, of, musa, balbisiana, those, primarily, exhibiting, the, botanical, characteristics, of, musa, acuminata, and, those, with, characteristics, of, both, researchers, norman, simmonds, and, ken, shepherd, proposed, a, genome, based, nomenclature, system, in, 1955, this, system, eliminated, almost, all, the, difficulties, and, inconsistencies, of, the, earlier, classification, of, bananas, based, on, assigning, scientific, names, to, cultivated, varieties, despite, this, the, original, names, are, still, recognized, by, some, authorities, leading, to, confusion, the, accepted, scientific, names, for, most, groups, of, cultivated, bananas, are, musa, acuminata, colla, and, musa, balbisiana, colla, for, the, ancestral, species, and, musa, paradisiaca, l, for, the, hybrid, of, the, two, an, unusual, feature, of, the, genetics, of, the, banana, is, that, chloroplast, dna, is, inherited, maternally, while, mitochondrial, dna, is, inherited, paternally, this, facilitates, taxonomic, study, of, species, and, subspecies, relationships, in, regions, such, as, north, america, and, europe, musa, fruits, offered, for, sale, can, be, divided, into, small, sweet, bananas, eaten, raw, when, ripe, as, a, dessert, and, large, starchy, plantains, or, cooking, bananas, which, do, not, have, to, be, ripe, linnaeus, made, this, distinction, when, naming, two, species, of, musa, members, of, the, plantain, subgroup, of, banana, cultivars, most, important, as, food, in, west, africa, and, latin, america, correspond, to, this, description, having, long, pointed, fruit, they, are, described, by, ploetz, et, al, as, true, plantains, distinct, from, other, cooking, bananas, the, cooking, bananas, of, east, africa, belong, to, a, different, group, the, east, african, highland, bananas, further, small, farmers, in, colombia, grow, a, much, wider, range, of, cultivars, than, large, commercial, plantations, do, and, in, southeast, asia, the, center, of, diversity, for, bananas, both, wild, and, cultivated, the, distinction, between, bananas, and, plantains, does, not, work, many, bananas, are, used, both, raw, and, cooked, there, are, starchy, cooking, bananas, which, are, smaller, than, those, eaten, raw, the, range, of, colors, sizes, and, shapes, is, far, wider, than, in, those, grown, or, sold, in, africa, europe, or, the, americas, southeast, asian, languages, do, not, make, the, distinction, between, bananas, and, plantains, that, is, made, in, english, thus, both, cavendish, dessert, bananas, and, saba, cooking, bananas, are, called, pisang, in, malaysia, and, indonesia, kluai, in, thailand, and, chu, i, in, vietnam, fe, i, bananas, grown, and, eaten, in, the, islands, of, the, pacific, are, derived, from, a, different, wild, species, most, fe, i, bananas, are, cooked, but, karat, bananas, which, are, short, and, squat, with, bright, red, skins, are, eaten, raw, the, earliest, domestication, of, bananas, musa, spp, was, from, naturally, occurring, parthenocarpic, seedless, individuals, of, musa, banksii, in, new, guinea, these, were, cultivated, by, papuans, before, the, arrival, of, austronesian, speakers, numerous, phytoliths, of, bananas, have, been, recovered, from, the, kuk, swamp, archaeological, site, and, dated, to, around, 10, 000, to, 6, 500, bp, foraging, humans, in, this, area, began, domestication, in, the, late, pleistocene, using, transplantation, and, early, cultivation, methods, by, the, early, to, middle, of, the, holocene, the, process, was, complete, from, new, guinea, cultivated, bananas, spread, westward, into, island, southeast, asia, they, hybridized, with, other, possibly, independently, domesticated, subspecies, of, musa, acuminata, as, well, as, m, balbisiana, in, the, philippines, northern, new, guinea, and, possibly, halmahera, these, hybridization, events, produced, the, triploid, cultivars, of, bananas, commonly, grown, today, the, banana, was, one, of, the, key, crops, that, enabled, farming, to, begin, in, papua, new, guinea, from, island, southeast, asia, bananas, became, part, of, the, staple, domesticated, crops, of, austronesian, peoples, these, ancient, introductions, resulted, in, the, banana, subgroup, now, known, as, the, true, plantains, which, include, the, east, african, highland, bananas, and, the, pacific, plantains, the, iholena, and, maoli, popo, ulu, subgroups, east, african, highland, bananas, originated, from, banana, populations, introduced, to, madagascar, probably, from, the, region, between, java, borneo, and, new, guinea, while, pacific, plantains, were, introduced, to, the, pacific, islands, from, either, eastern, new, guinea, or, the, bismarck, archipelago, 21st, century, discoveries, of, phytoliths, in, cameroon, dating, to, the, first, millennium, bce, triggered, a, debate, about, the, date, of, first, cultivation, in, africa, there, is, linguistic, evidence, that, bananas, were, known, in, east, africa, or, madagascar, around, that, time, the, earliest, prior, evidence, indicates, that, cultivation, dates, to, no, earlier, than, the, late, 6th, century, ad, malagasy, people, colonized, madagascar, from, south, east, asia, around, 600, ad, onwards, glucanase, and, two, other, proteins, specific, to, bananas, were, found, in, dental, calculus, from, the, early, iron, age, 12th, century, bce, philistines, in, tel, erani, in, the, southern, levant, another, wave, of, introductions, later, spread, bananas, to, other, parts, of, tropical, asia, particularly, indochina, and, the, indian, subcontinent, some, evidence, suggests, bananas, were, known, to, the, indus, valley, civilisation, from, phytoliths, recovered, from, the, kot, diji, archaeological, site, in, pakistan, southeast, asia, remains, the, region, of, primary, diversity, of, the, banana, areas, of, secondary, diversity, are, found, in, africa, indicating, a, long, history, of, banana, cultivation, there, the, banana, may, have, been, present, in, isolated, locations, elsewhere, in, the, middle, east, on, the, eve, of, islam, the, spread, of, islam, was, followed, by, far, reaching, diffusion, there, are, numerous, references, to, it, in, islamic, texts, such, as, poems, and, hadiths, beginning, in, the, 9th, century, by, the, 10th, century, the, banana, appeared, in, texts, from, palestine, and, egypt, from, there, it, diffused, into, north, africa, and, muslim, iberia, during, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, an, article, on, banana, tree, cultivation, is, included, in, ibn, al, awwam, s, 12th, century, agricultural, work, kit, b, al, fil, a, book, on, agriculture, during, the, middle, ages, bananas, from, granada, were, considered, among, the, best, in, the, arab, world, bananas, were, certainly, grown, in, the, christian, kingdom, of, cyprus, by, the, late, medieval, period, writing, in, 1458, the, italian, traveller, and, writer, gabriele, capodilista, wrote, favourably, of, the, extensive, farm, produce, of, the, estates, at, episkopi, near, modern, day, limassol, including, the, region, s, banana, plantations, in, the, early, modern, period, bananas, were, encountered, by, european, explorers, during, the, magellan, expedition, in, 1521, in, both, guam, and, the, philippines, lacking, a, name, for, the, fruit, the, ship, s, historian, antonio, pigafetta, described, them, as, figs, more, than, one, palm, long, 130, 132, bananas, were, introduced, to, south, america, by, portuguese, sailors, who, brought, them, from, west, africa, in, the, 16th, century, southeast, asian, banana, cultivars, as, well, as, abaca, grown, for, fibers, were, introduced, to, north, and, central, america, by, the, spanish, from, the, philippines, via, the, manila, galleons, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, portuguese, colonists, started, banana, plantations, in, the, atlantic, islands, brazil, and, western, africa, north, americans, began, consuming, bananas, on, a, small, scale, at, very, high, prices, shortly, after, the, civil, war, though, it, was, only, in, the, 1880s, that, the, food, became, more, widespread, as, late, as, the, victorian, era, bananas, were, not, widely, known, in, europe, although, they, were, available, the, earliest, modern, plantations, originated, in, jamaica, and, the, related, western, caribbean, zone, including, most, of, central, america, plantation, cultivation, involved, the, combination, of, modern, transportation, networks, of, steamships, and, railroads, with, the, development, of, refrigeration, that, allowed, more, time, between, harvesting, and, ripening, north, american, shippers, like, lorenzo, dow, baker, and, andrew, preston, the, founders, of, the, boston, fruit, company, started, this, process, in, the, 1870s, with, the, participation, of, railroad, builders, like, minor, c, keith, development, led, to, the, multi, national, giant, corporations, like, chiquita, and, dole, these, companies, were, monopolistic, vertically, integrated, controlling, growing, processing, shipping, and, marketing, and, usually, used, political, manipulation, to, build, enclave, economies, internally, self, sufficient, virtually, tax, exempt, and, export, oriented, contributing, little, to, the, host, economy, their, political, maneuvers, which, gave, rise, to, the, term, banana, republic, for, states, such, as, honduras, and, guatemala, included, working, with, local, elites, and, their, rivalries, to, influence, politics, or, playing, the, international, interests, of, the, united, states, especially, during, the, cold, war, to, keep, the, political, climate, favorable, to, their, interests, the, vast, majority, of, the, world, s, bananas, are, cultivated, for, family, consumption, or, for, sale, on, local, markets, they, are, grown, in, large, quantities, in, india, while, many, other, asian, and, african, countries, host, numerous, small, scale, banana, growers, who, sell, at, least, some, of, their, crop, peasants, with, smallholdings, of, 1, to, 2, acres, in, the, caribbean, produce, bananas, for, the, world, market, often, alongside, other, crops, in, many, tropical, countries, the, main, cultivars, produce, green, unripe, bananas, used, for, cooking, because, bananas, and, plantains, produce, fruit, year, round, they, provide, a, valuable, food, source, during, the, hunger, season, between, harvests, of, other, crops, and, are, thus, important, for, global, food, security, bananas, are, propagated, asexually, from, offshoots, the, plant, is, allowed, to, produce, two, shoots, at, a, time, a, larger, one, for, immediate, fruiting, and, a, smaller, sucker, or, follower, to, produce, fruit, in, 6, 8, months, as, a, non, seasonal, crop, bananas, are, available, fresh, year, round, they, are, grown, in, some, 135, countries, in, global, commerce, in, 2009, by, far, the, most, important, cultivars, belonged, to, the, triploid, musa, acuminata, aaa, group, of, cavendish, group, bananas, disease, is, threatening, the, production, of, the, cavendish, banana, worldwide, it, is, unclear, if, any, existing, cultivar, can, replace, cavendish, bananas, so, various, hybridisation, and, genetic, engineering, programs, are, attempting, to, create, a, disease, resistant, mass, market, banana, one, such, strain, that, has, emerged, is, the, taiwanese, cavendish, or, formosana, export, bananas, are, picked, green, and, ripened, in, special, rooms, upon, arrival, in, the, destination, country, these, rooms, are, air, tight, and, filled, with, ethylene, gas, to, induce, ripening, this, mimics, the, normal, production, of, this, gas, as, a, ripening, hormone, ethylene, stimulates, the, formation, of, amylase, an, enzyme, that, breaks, down, starch, into, sugar, influencing, the, taste, ethylene, signals, the, production, of, pectinase, a, different, enzyme, which, breaks, down, the, pectin, between, the, cells, of, the, banana, causing, the, banana, to, soften, as, it, ripens, the, vivid, yellow, color, many, consumers, in, temperate, climates, associate, with, bananas, is, caused, by, ripening, around, 18, c, 64, f, and, does, not, occur, in, cavendish, bananas, ripened, in, tropical, temperatures, over, 27, c, 81, f, which, leaves, them, green, bananas, are, transported, over, long, distances, from, the, tropics, to, world, markets, to, obtain, maximum, shelf, life, harvest, comes, before, the, fruit, is, mature, the, fruit, requires, careful, handling, rapid, transport, to, ports, cooling, and, refrigerated, shipping, the, goal, is, to, prevent, the, bananas, from, producing, their, natural, ripening, agent, ethylene, this, technology, allows, storage, and, transport, for, 3, 4, weeks, at, 13, c, 55, f, on, arrival, bananas, are, held, at, about, 17, c, 63, f, and, treated, with, a, low, concentration, of, ethylene, after, a, few, days, the, fruit, begins, to, ripen, and, is, distributed, for, final, sale, ripe, bananas, can, be, held, for, a, few, days, at, home, if, bananas, are, too, green, they, can, be, put, in, a, brown, paper, bag, with, an, apple, or, tomato, overnight, to, speed, up, the, ripening, process, the, excessive, use, of, fertilizers, contributes, greatly, to, eutrophication, in, streams, and, lakes, harming, aquatic, life, while, expanding, banana, production, has, led, to, deforestation, as, soil, nutrients, are, depleted, more, forest, is, cleared, for, plantations, this, causes, soil, erosion, and, increases, the, frequency, of, flooding, voluntary, sustainability, standards, such, as, rainforest, alliance, and, fairtrade, are, being, used, to, address, some, of, these, issues, banana, production, certified, in, this, way, grew, rapidly, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, to, represent, 36, of, banana, exports, by, 2016, however, such, standards, are, applied, mainly, in, countries, which, focus, on, the, export, market, such, as, colombia, costa, rica, ecuador, and, guatemala, worldwide, they, cover, only, 8, 10, of, production, mutation, breeding, can, be, used, in, this, crop, aneuploidy, is, a, source, of, significant, variation, in, allotriploid, varieties, for, one, example, it, can, be, a, source, of, tr4, resistance, lab, protocols, have, been, devised, to, screen, for, such, aberrations, and, for, possible, resulting, disease, resistances, wild, musa, spp, provide, useful, resistance, genetics, and, are, vital, to, breeding, for, tr4, resistance, as, shown, in, introgressed, resistance, from, wild, relatives, the, honduran, foundation, for, agricultural, research, has, bred, a, seedless, banana, that, is, resistant, to, both, panama, disease, and, black, sigatoka, disease, the, team, made, use, of, the, fact, that, seedless, varieties, do, rarely, produce, seeds, they, obtained, around, fifteen, seeds, from, some, 30, 000, cultivated, plants, pollinated, by, hand, with, pollen, from, wild, asian, bananas, as, of, 2018, bananas, are, exported, in, larger, volume, and, to, a, larger, value, than, any, other, fruit, in, 2022, world, production, of, bananas, and, plantains, combined, was, 179, million, tonnes, led, by, india, and, china, with, a, combined, total, of, 26, of, global, production, other, major, producers, were, uganda, indonesia, the, philippines, nigeria, and, ecuador, as, reported, for, 2013, total, world, exports, were, 20, million, tonnes, of, bananas, and, 859, 000, tonnes, of, plantains, ecuador, and, the, philippines, were, the, leading, exporters, with, 5, 4, and, 3, 3, million, tonnes, respectively, and, the, dominican, republic, was, the, leading, exporter, of, plantains, with, 210, 350, tonnes, bananas, are, damaged, by, a, variety, of, pests, especially, nematodes, and, insects, banana, roots, are, subject, to, damage, from, multiple, species, of, parasitic, nematodes, radopholus, similis, causes, nematode, root, rot, the, most, serious, nematode, disease, of, bananas, in, economic, terms, root, knot, is, the, result, of, infection, by, species, of, meloidogyne, while, root, lesion, is, caused, by, species, of, pratylenchus, and, spiral, nematode, root, damage, is, the, result, of, infection, by, helicotylenchus, species, among, the, main, insect, pests, of, banana, cultivation, are, two, beetles, that, cause, substantial, economic, losses, the, banana, borer, cosmopolites, sordidus, and, the, banana, stem, weevil, odoiporus, longicollis, other, significant, pests, include, aphids, and, scarring, beetles, although, in, no, danger, of, outright, extinction, bananas, of, the, cavendish, group, which, dominate, the, global, market, are, under, threat, there, is, a, need, to, enrich, banana, biodiversity, by, producing, diverse, new, banana, varieties, not, just, focusing, on, the, cavendish, its, predecessor, gros, michel, discovered, in, the, 1820s, was, similarly, dominant, but, had, to, be, replaced, after, widespread, infections, of, panama, disease, monocropping, of, cavendish, similarly, leaves, it, susceptible, to, disease, and, so, threatens, both, commercial, cultivation, and, small, scale, subsistence, farming, within, the, data, gathered, from, the, genes, of, hundreds, of, bananas, the, botanist, julie, sardos, has, found, several, wild, banana, ancestors, currently, unknown, to, scientists, whose, genes, could, provide, a, means, of, defense, against, banana, crop, diseases, some, commentators, have, remarked, that, those, variants, which, could, replace, what, much, of, the, world, considers, a, typical, banana, are, so, different, that, most, people, would, not, consider, them, the, same, fruit, and, blame, the, decline, of, the, banana, on, monogenetic, cultivation, driven, by, short, term, commercial, motives, overall, fungal, diseases, are, disproportionately, important, to, small, island, developing, states, panama, disease, is, caused, by, a, fusarium, soil, fungus, which, enters, the, plants, through, the, roots, and, travels, with, water, into, the, trunk, and, leaves, producing, gels, and, gums, that, cut, off, the, flow, of, water, and, nutrients, causing, the, plant, to, wilt, and, exposing, the, rest, of, the, plant, to, lethal, amounts, of, sunlight, prior, to, 1960, almost, all, commercial, banana, production, centered, on, the, gros, michel, cultivar, which, was, highly, susceptible, cavendish, was, chosen, as, the, replacement, for, gros, michel, because, among, resistant, cultivars, it, produces, the, highest, quality, fruit, it, requires, more, care, during, shipping, and, its, quality, compared, to, gros, michel, is, debated, fusarium, wilt, tr4, a, reinvigorated, strain, of, panama, disease, was, discovered, in, 1993, this, virulent, form, of, fusarium, wilt, has, destroyed, cavendish, plantations, in, several, southeast, asian, countries, and, spread, to, australia, and, india, as, the, soil, based, fungi, can, easily, be, carried, on, boots, clothing, or, tools, the, wilt, spread, to, the, americas, despite, years, of, preventive, efforts, without, genetic, diversity, cavendish, is, highly, susceptible, to, tr4, and, the, disease, endangers, its, commercial, production, worldwide, the, only, known, defense, to, tr4, is, genetic, resistance, this, is, conferred, either, by, rga2, a, gene, isolated, from, a, tr4, resistant, diploid, banana, or, by, the, nematode, derived, ced9, this, may, be, achieved, by, genetic, modification, black, sigatoka, is, a, fungal, leaf, spot, disease, first, observed, in, fiji, in, 1963, or, 1964, it, is, caused, by, the, ascomycete, mycosphaerella, fijiensis, the, disease, also, called, black, leaf, streak, has, spread, to, banana, plantations, throughout, the, tropics, from, infected, banana, leaves, used, as, packing, material, it, affects, all, main, cultivars, of, bananas, and, plantains, including, the, cavendish, cultivars, impeding, photosynthesis, by, blackening, parts, of, the, leaves, eventually, killing, the, entire, leaf, starved, for, energy, fruit, production, falls, by, 50, or, more, and, the, bananas, that, do, grow, ripen, prematurely, making, them, unsuitable, for, export, the, fungus, has, shown, ever, increasing, resistance, to, treatment, spraying, with, fungicides, may, be, required, as, often, as, 50, times, a, year, better, strategies, with, integrated, pest, management, are, needed, banana, bunchy, top, virus, is, a, plant, virus, of, the, genus, babuvirus, family, nanonviridae, affecting, musa, spp, including, banana, abaca, plantain, and, ornamental, bananas, and, ensete, spp, in, the, family, musaceae, banana, bunchy, top, disease, symptoms, include, dark, green, streaks, of, variable, length, in, leaf, veins, midribs, and, petioles, leaves, become, short, and, stunted, as, the, disease, progresses, becoming, bunched, at, the, apex, of, the, plant, infected, plants, may, produce, no, fruit, or, the, fruit, bunch, may, not, emerge, from, the, pseudostem, the, virus, is, transmitted, by, the, banana, aphid, pentalonia, nigronervosa, and, is, widespread, in, southeast, asia, asia, the, philippines, taiwan, oceania, and, parts, of, africa, there, is, no, cure, but, it, can, be, effectively, controlled, by, the, eradication, of, diseased, plants, and, the, use, of, virus, free, planting, material, no, resistant, cultivars, have, been, found, but, varietal, differences, in, susceptibility, have, been, reported, the, commercially, important, cavendish, subgroup, is, severely, affected, banana, bacterial, wilt, is, a, bacterial, disease, caused, by, xanthomonas, campestris, pv, musacearum, first, identified, on, a, close, relative, of, bananas, ensete, ventricosum, in, ethiopia, in, the, 1960s, the, disease, was, first, seen, in, uganda, in, 2001, affecting, all, banana, cultivars, since, then, it, has, been, diagnosed, in, central, and, east, africa, including, the, banana, growing, regions, of, rwanda, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, tanzania, kenya, burundi, and, uganda, given, the, narrow, range, of, genetic, diversity, present, in, bananas, and, the, many, threats, via, biotic, pests, and, diseases, and, abiotic, threats, such, as, drought, stress, conservation, of, the, full, spectrum, of, banana, genetic, resources, is, ongoing, in, 2024, the, economist, pascal, liu, of, the, fao, described, the, impact, of, global, warming, as, an, enormous, threat, to, the, world, supply, of, bananas, banana, germplasm, is, conserved, in, many, national, and, regional, gene, banks, and, at, the, world, s, largest, banana, collection, the, international, musa, germplasm, transit, centre, managed, by, bioversity, international, and, hosted, at, ku, leuven, in, belgium, since, musa, cultivars, are, mostly, seedless, they, are, conserved, by, three, main, methods, in, vivo, planted, in, field, collections, in, vitro, as, plantlets, in, test, tubes, within, a, controlled, environment, and, by, cryopreservation, meristems, conserved, in, liquid, nitrogen, at, 196, c, genes, from, wild, banana, species, are, conserved, as, dna, and, as, cryopreserved, pollen, seeds, from, wild, species, are, sometimes, conserved, although, less, commonly, as, they, are, difficult, to, regenerate, in, addition, bananas, and, their, crop, wild, relatives, are, conserved, in, situ, in, the, wild, natural, habitats, where, they, evolved, and, continue, to, do, so, diversity, is, also, conserved, in, farmers, fields, where, continuous, cultivation, adaptation, and, improvement, of, cultivars, is, often, carried, out, by, small, scale, farmers, growing, traditional, local, cultivars, a, raw, banana, not, including, the, peel, is, 75,
