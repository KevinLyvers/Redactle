a, wasp, is, any, insect, of, the, narrow, waisted, suborder, apocrita, of, the, order, hymenoptera, which, is, neither, a, bee, nor, an, ant, this, excludes, the, broad, waisted, sawflies, symphyta, which, look, somewhat, like, wasps, but, are, in, a, separate, suborder, the, wasps, do, not, constitute, a, clade, a, complete, natural, group, with, a, single, ancestor, as, bees, and, ants, are, deeply, nested, within, the, wasps, having, evolved, from, wasp, ancestors, wasps, that, are, members, of, the, clade, aculeata, can, sting, their, prey, the, most, commonly, known, wasps, such, as, yellowjackets, and, hornets, are, in, the, family, vespidae, and, are, eusocial, living, together, in, a, nest, with, an, egg, laying, queen, and, non, reproducing, workers, eusociality, is, favoured, by, the, unusual, haplodiploid, system, of, sex, determination, in, hymenoptera, as, it, makes, sisters, exceptionally, closely, related, to, each, other, however, the, majority, of, wasp, species, are, solitary, with, each, adult, female, living, and, breeding, independently, females, typically, have, an, ovipositor, for, laying, eggs, in, or, near, a, food, source, for, the, larvae, though, in, the, aculeata, the, ovipositor, is, often, modified, instead, into, a, sting, used, for, defense, or, prey, capture, wasps, play, many, ecological, roles, some, are, predators, or, pollinators, whether, to, feed, themselves, or, to, provision, their, nests, many, notably, the, cuckoo, wasps, are, kleptoparasites, laying, eggs, in, the, nests, of, other, wasps, many, of, the, solitary, wasps, are, parasitoidal, meaning, they, lay, eggs, on, or, in, other, insects, any, life, stage, from, egg, to, adult, and, often, provision, their, own, nests, with, such, hosts, unlike, true, parasites, the, wasp, larvae, eventually, kill, their, hosts, solitary, wasps, parasitize, almost, every, pest, insect, making, wasps, valuable, in, horticulture, for, biological, pest, control, of, species, such, as, whitefly, in, tomatoes, and, other, crops, wasps, first, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, jurassic, and, diversified, into, many, surviving, superfamilies, by, the, cretaceous, they, are, a, successful, and, diverse, group, of, insects, with, tens, of, thousands, of, described, species, wasps, have, spread, to, all, parts, of, the, world, except, for, the, polar, regions, the, largest, social, wasp, is, the, asian, giant, hornet, at, up, to, 5, centimetres, 2, 0, in, in, length, among, the, largest, solitary, wasps, is, a, group, of, species, known, as, tarantula, hawks, along, with, the, giant, scoliid, of, indonesia, megascolia, procer, the, smallest, wasps, are, solitary, parasitoid, wasps, in, the, family, mymaridae, including, the, world, s, smallest, known, insect, with, a, body, length, of, only, 0, 139, mm, 0, 0055, in, and, the, smallest, known, flying, insect, only, 0, 15, mm, 0, 0059, in, long, wasps, have, appeared, in, literature, from, classical, times, as, the, eponymous, chorus, of, old, men, in, aristophanes, 422, bc, comedy, the, wasps, and, in, science, fiction, from, h, g, wells, s, 1904, novel, the, food, of, the, gods, and, how, it, came, to, earth, featuring, giant, wasps, with, three, inch, long, stings, the, name, wasp, has, been, used, for, many, warships, and, other, military, equipment, the, wasps, are, a, cosmopolitan, paraphyletic, grouping, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, species, consisting, of, the, narrow, waisted, clade, apocrita, without, the, ants, and, bees, the, hymenoptera, also, contain, the, somewhat, wasplike, but, unwaisted, symphyta, the, sawflies, the, term, wasp, is, sometimes, used, more, narrowly, for, members, of, the, vespidae, which, includes, several, eusocial, wasp, lineages, such, as, yellowjackets, the, genera, vespula, and, dolichovespula, hornets, genus, vespa, and, members, of, the, subfamily, polistinae, hymenoptera, in, the, form, of, symphyta, xyelidae, first, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, lower, triassic, apocrita, wasps, in, the, broad, sense, appeared, in, the, jurassic, and, had, diversified, into, many, of, the, extant, superfamilies, by, the, cretaceous, they, appear, to, have, evolved, from, the, symphyta, fig, wasps, with, modern, anatomical, features, first, appeared, in, the, lower, cretaceous, of, the, crato, formation, in, brazil, some, 65, million, years, before, the, first, fig, trees, the, vespidae, include, the, extinct, genus, palaeovespa, seven, species, of, which, are, known, from, the, eocene, rocks, of, the, florissant, fossil, beds, of, colorado, and, from, fossilised, baltic, amber, in, europe, also, found, in, baltic, amber, are, crown, wasps, of, the, genus, electrostephanus, wasps, are, a, diverse, group, estimated, at, well, over, a, hundred, thousand, described, species, around, the, world, and, a, great, many, more, as, yet, undescribed, for, example, almost, every, one, of, some, 1000, species, of, tropical, fig, trees, has, its, own, specific, fig, wasp, chalcidoidea, that, has, co, evolved, with, it, and, pollinates, it, many, wasp, species, are, parasitoids, the, females, deposit, eggs, on, or, in, a, host, arthropod, on, which, the, larvae, then, feed, some, larvae, start, off, as, parasitoids, but, convert, at, a, later, stage, to, consuming, the, plant, tissues, that, their, host, is, feeding, on, in, other, species, the, eggs, are, laid, directly, into, plant, tissues, and, form, galls, which, protect, the, developing, larvae, from, predators, but, not, necessarily, from, other, parasitic, wasps, in, some, species, the, larvae, are, predatory, themselves, the, wasp, eggs, are, deposited, in, clusters, of, eggs, laid, by, other, insects, and, these, are, then, consumed, by, the, developing, wasp, larvae, the, largest, social, wasp, is, the, asian, giant, hornet, at, up, to, 5, centimetres, 2, 0, in, in, length, the, various, tarantula, hawk, wasps, are, of, a, similar, size, and, can, overpower, a, spider, many, times, its, own, weight, and, move, it, to, its, burrow, with, a, sting, that, is, excruciatingly, painful, to, humans, the, solitary, giant, scoliid, megascolia, procer, with, a, wingspan, of, 11, 5, cm, has, subspecies, in, sumatra, and, java, it, is, a, parasitoid, of, the, atlas, beetle, chalcosoma, atlas, the, female, giant, ichneumon, wasp, megarhyssa, macrurus, is, 12, 5, centimetres, 5, in, long, including, its, very, long, but, slender, ovipositor, which, is, used, for, boring, into, wood, and, inserting, eggs, the, smallest, wasps, are, solitary, parasitoid, wasps, in, the, family, mymaridae, including, the, world, s, smallest, known, insect, dicopomorpha, echmepterygis, 139, micrometres, long, and, kikiki, huna, with, a, body, length, of, only, 158, micrometres, the, smallest, known, flying, insect, there, are, estimated, to, be, 100, 000, species, of, ichneumonoid, wasps, in, the, families, braconidae, and, ichneumonidae, these, are, almost, exclusively, parasitoids, mostly, using, other, insects, as, hosts, another, family, the, pompilidae, is, a, specialist, parasitoid, of, spiders, some, wasps, are, even, parasitoids, of, parasitoids, the, eggs, of, euceros, are, laid, beside, lepidopteran, larvae, and, the, wasp, larvae, feed, temporarily, on, their, haemolymph, but, if, a, parasitoid, emerges, from, the, host, the, hyperparasites, continue, their, life, cycle, inside, the, parasitoid, parasitoids, maintain, their, extreme, diversity, through, narrow, specialism, in, peru, 18, wasp, species, were, found, living, on, 14, fly, species, in, only, two, species, of, gurania, climbing, squash, of, the, dozens, of, extant, wasp, families, only, the, family, vespidae, contains, social, species, primarily, in, the, subfamilies, vespinae, and, polistinae, with, their, powerful, stings, and, conspicuous, warning, coloration, often, in, black, and, yellow, social, wasps, are, frequent, models, for, batesian, mimicry, by, non, stinging, insects, and, are, themselves, involved, in, mutually, beneficial, m, llerian, mimicry, of, other, distasteful, insects, including, bees, and, other, wasps, all, species, of, social, wasps, construct, their, nests, using, some, form, of, plant, fiber, mostly, wood, pulp, as, the, primary, material, though, this, can, be, supplemented, with, mud, plant, secretions, e, g, resin, and, secretions, from, the, wasps, themselves, multiple, fibrous, brood, cells, are, constructed, arranged, in, a, honeycombed, pattern, and, often, surrounded, by, a, larger, protective, envelope, wood, fibres, are, gathered, from, weathered, wood, softened, by, chewing, and, mixing, with, saliva, the, placement, of, nests, varies, from, group, to, group, yellow, jackets, such, as, dolichovespula, media, and, d, sylvestris, prefer, to, nest, in, trees, and, shrubs, protopolybia, exigua, attaches, its, nests, on, the, underside, of, leaves, and, branches, polistes, erythrocephalus, chooses, sites, close, to, a, water, source, other, wasps, like, agelaia, multipicta, and, vespula, germanica, like, to, nest, in, cavities, that, include, holes, in, the, ground, spaces, under, homes, wall, cavities, or, in, lofts, while, most, species, of, wasps, have, nests, with, multiple, combs, some, species, such, as, apoica, flavissima, only, have, one, comb, the, length, of, the, reproductive, cycle, depends, on, latitude, polistes, erythrocephalus, for, example, has, a, much, longer, up, to, 3, months, longer, cycle, in, temperate, regions, the, vast, majority, of, wasp, species, are, solitary, insects, having, mated, the, adult, female, forages, alone, and, if, it, builds, a, nest, does, so, for, the, benefit, of, its, own, offspring, some, solitary, wasps, nest, in, small, groups, alongside, others, of, their, species, but, each, is, involved, in, caring, for, its, own, offspring, except, for, such, actions, as, stealing, other, wasps, prey, or, laying, in, other, wasp, s, nests, there, are, some, species, of, solitary, wasp, that, build, communal, nests, each, insect, having, its, own, cell, and, providing, food, for, its, own, offspring, but, these, wasps, do, not, adopt, the, division, of, labour, and, the, complex, behavioural, patterns, adopted, by, eusocial, species, adult, solitary, wasps, spend, most, of, their, time, in, preparing, their, nests, and, foraging, for, food, for, their, young, mostly, insects, or, spiders, their, nesting, habits, are, more, diverse, than, those, of, social, wasps, many, species, dig, burrows, in, the, ground, mud, daubers, and, pollen, wasps, construct, mud, cells, in, sheltered, places, potter, wasps, similarly, build, vase, like, nests, from, mud, often, with, multiple, cells, attached, to, the, twigs, of, trees, or, against, walls, predatory, wasp, species, normally, subdue, their, prey, by, stinging, it, and, then, either, lay, their, eggs, on, it, leaving, it, in, place, or, carry, it, back, to, their, nest, where, an, egg, may, be, laid, on, the, prey, item, and, the, nest, sealed, or, several, smaller, prey, items, may, be, deposited, to, feed, a, single, developing, larva, apart, from, providing, food, for, their, offspring, no, further, maternal, care, is, given, members, of, the, family, chrysididae, the, cuckoo, wasps, are, kleptoparasites, and, lay, their, eggs, in, the, nests, of, unrelated, host, species, like, all, insects, wasps, have, a, hard, exoskeleton, which, protects, their, three, main, body, parts, the, head, the, mesosoma, including, the, thorax, and, the, first, segment, of, the, abdomen, and, the, metasoma, there, is, a, narrow, waist, the, petiole, joining, the, first, and, second, segments, of, the, abdomen, the, two, pairs, of, membranous, wings, are, held, together, by, small, hooks, and, the, forewings, are, larger, than, the, hind, ones, in, some, species, the, females, have, no, wings, in, females, there, is, usually, a, rigid, ovipositor, which, may, be, modified, for, injecting, venom, piercing, or, sawing, it, either, extends, freely, or, can, be, retracted, and, may, be, developed, into, a, stinger, for, both, defence, and, for, paralysing, prey, in, addition, to, their, large, compound, eyes, wasps, have, several, simple, eyes, known, as, ocelli, which, are, typically, arranged, in, a, triangle, just, forward, of, the, vertex, of, the, head, wasps, possess, mandibles, adapted, for, biting, and, cutting, like, those, of, many, other, insects, such, as, grasshoppers, but, their, other, mouthparts, are, formed, into, a, suctorial, proboscis, which, enables, them, to, drink, nectar, the, larvae, of, wasps, resemble, maggots, and, are, adapted, for, life, in, a, protected, environment, this, may, be, the, body, of, a, host, organism, or, a, cell, in, a, nest, where, the, larva, either, eats, the, provisions, left, for, it, or, in, social, species, is, fed, by, the, adults, such, larvae, have, soft, bodies, with, no, limbs, and, have, a, blind, gut, presumably, so, that, they, do, not, foul, their, cell, adult, solitary, wasps, mainly, feed, on, nectar, but, the, majority, of, their, time, is, taken, up, by, foraging, for, food, for, their, carnivorous, young, mostly, insects, or, spiders, apart, from, providing, food, for, their, larval, offspring, no, maternal, care, is, given, some, wasp, species, provide, food, for, the, young, repeatedly, during, their, development, progressive, provisioning, others, such, as, potter, wasps, eumeninae, and, sand, wasps, ammophila, sphecidae, repeatedly, build, nests, which, they, stock, with, a, supply, of, immobilised, prey, such, as, one, large, caterpillar, laying, a, single, egg, in, or, on, its, body, and, then, sealing, up, the, entrance, mass, provisioning, predatory, and, parasitoidal, wasps, subdue, their, prey, by, stinging, it, they, hunt, a, wide, variety, of, prey, mainly, other, insects, including, other, hymenoptera, both, larvae, and, adults, the, pompilidae, specialize, in, catching, spiders, to, provision, their, nests, some, social, wasps, are, omnivorous, feeding, on, fallen, fruit, nectar, and, carrion, such, as, dead, insects, adult, male, wasps, sometimes, visit, flowers, to, obtain, nectar, some, wasps, such, as, polistes, fuscatus, commonly, return, to, locations, where, they, previously, found, prey, to, forage, in, many, social, species, the, larvae, exude, copious, amounts, of, salivary, secretions, that, are, avidly, consumed, by, the, adults, these, include, both, sugars, and, amino, acids, and, may, provide, essential, protein, building, nutrients, that, are, otherwise, unavailable, to, the, adults, who, cannot, digest, proteins, in, wasps, as, in, other, hymenoptera, sex, is, determined, by, a, haplodiploid, system, which, means, that, females, are, unusually, closely, related, to, their, sisters, enabling, kin, selection, to, favour, the, evolution, of, eusocial, behaviour, females, are, diploid, meaning, that, they, have, 2n, chromosomes, and, develop, from, fertilized, eggs, males, called, drones, have, a, haploid, n, number, of, chromosomes, and, develop, from, an, unfertilized, egg, wasps, store, sperm, inside, their, body, and, control, its, release, for, each, individual, egg, as, it, is, laid, if, a, female, wishes, to, produce, a, male, egg, she, simply, lays, the, egg, without, fertilizing, it, therefore, under, most, conditions, in, most, species, wasps, have, complete, voluntary, control, over, the, sex, of, their, offspring, experimental, infection, of, muscidifurax, uniraptor, with, the, bacterium, wolbachia, induced, thelytokous, reproduction, and, an, inability, to, produce, fertile, viable, male, offspring, females, of, the, solitary, wasp, parasitoid, venturia, canescens, can, avoid, mating, with, their, brothers, through, kin, recognition, in, experimental, comparisons, the, probability, that, a, female, will, mate, with, an, unrelated, male, was, about, twice, as, high, as, the, chance, of, her, mating, with, brothers, female, wasps, appear, to, recognize, siblings, on, the, basis, of, a, chemical, signature, carried, or, emitted, by, males, sibling, mating, avoidance, reduces, inbreeding, depression, that, is, largely, due, to, the, expression, of, homozygous, deleterious, recessive, mutations, while, the, vast, majority, of, wasps, play, no, role, in, pollination, a, few, species, can, effectively, transport, pollen, and, pollinate, several, plant, species, since, wasps, generally, do, not, have, a, fur, like, covering, of, soft, hairs, and, a, special, body, part, for, pollen, storage, pollen, basket, as, some, bees, do, pollen, does, not, stick, to, them, well, however, it, has, been, shown, that, even, without, hairs, several, wasp, species, are, able, to, effectively, transport, pollen, therefore, contributing, for, potential, pollination, of, several, plant, species, pollen, wasps, in, the, subfamily, masarinae, gather, nectar, and, pollen, in, a, crop, inside, their, bodies, rather, than, on, body, hairs, like, bees, and, pollinate, flowers, of, penstemon, and, the, water, leaf, family, hydrophyllaceae, the, agaonidae, fig, wasps, are, the, only, pollinators, of, nearly, 1000, species, of, figs, and, thus, are, crucial, to, the, survival, of, their, host, plants, since, the, wasps, are, equally, dependent, on, their, fig, trees, for, survival, the, coevolved, relationship, is, fully, mutualistic, most, solitary, wasps, are, parasitoids, as, adults, those, that, do, feed, typically, only, take, nectar, from, flowers, parasitoid, wasps, are, extremely, diverse, in, habits, many, laying, their, eggs, in, inert, stages, of, their, host, egg, or, pupa, sometimes, paralysing, their, prey, by, injecting, it, with, venom, through, their, ovipositor, they, then, insert, one, or, more, eggs, into, the, host, or, deposit, them, upon, the, outside, of, the, host, the, host, remains, alive, until, the, parasitoid, larvae, pupate, or, emerge, as, adults, the, ichneumonidae, are, specialized, parasitoids, often, of, lepidoptera, larvae, deeply, buried, in, plant, tissues, which, may, be, woody, for, this, purpose, they, have, exceptionally, long, ovipositors, they, detect, their, hosts, by, smell, and, vibration, some, of, the, largest, species, including, rhyssa, persuasoria, and, megarhyssa, macrurus, parasitise, horntails, large, sawflies, whose, adult, females, also, have, impressively, long, ovipositors, some, parasitic, species, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, a, polydnavirus, that, weakens, the, host, s, immune, system, and, replicates, in, the, oviduct, of, the, female, wasp, one, family, of, chalcidoid, wasps, the, eucharitidae, has, specialized, as, parasitoids, of, ants, most, species, hosted, by, one, genus, of, ant, eucharitids, are, among, the, few, parasitoids, that, have, been, able, to, overcome, ants, effective, defences, against, parasitoids, many, species, of, wasp, including, especially, the, cuckoo, or, jewel, wasps, chrysididae, are, kleptoparasites, laying, their, eggs, in, the, nests, of, other, wasp, species, to, exploit, their, parental, care, most, such, species, attack, hosts, that, provide, provisions, for, their, immature, stages, such, as, paralyzed, prey, items, and, they, either, consume, the, provisions, intended, for, the, host, larva, or, wait, for, the, host, to, develop, and, then, consume, it, before, it, reaches, adulthood, an, example, of, a, true, brood, parasite, is, the, paper, wasp, polistes, sulcifer, which, lays, its, eggs, in, the, nests, of, other, paper, wasps, specifically, polistes, dominula, and, whose, larvae, are, then, fed, directly, by, the, host, sand, wasps, ammophila, often, save, time, and, energy, by, parasitising, the, nests, of, other, females, of, their, own, species, either, kleptoparasitically, stealing, prey, or, as, brood, parasites, removing, the, other, female, s, egg, from, the, prey, and, laying, their, own, in, its, place, according, to, emery, s, rule, social, parasites, especially, among, insects, tend, to, parasitise, species, or, genera, to, which, they, are, closely, related, for, example, the, social, wasp, dolichovespula, adulterina, parasitises, other, members, of, its, genus, such, as, d, norwegica, and, d, arenaria, many, wasp, lineages, including, those, in, the, families, vespidae, crabronidae, sphecidae, and, pompilidae, attack, and, sting, prey, items, that, they, use, as, food, for, their, larvae, while, vespidae, usually, macerate, their, prey, and, feed, the, resulting, bits, directly, to, their, brood, most, predatory, wasps, paralyze, their, prey, and, lay, eggs, directly, upon, the, bodies, and, the, wasp, larvae, consume, them, apart, from, collecting, prey, items, to, provision, their, young, many, wasps, are, also, opportunistic, feeders, and, will, suck, the, body, fluids, of, their, prey, although, vespid, mandibles, are, adapted, for, chewing, and, they, appear, to, be, feeding, on, the, organism, they, are, often, merely, macerating, it, into, submission, the, impact, of, the, predation, of, wasps, on, economic, pests, is, difficult, to, establish, the, roughly, 140, species, of,

where, the, mimic, is, also, distasteful, and, the, mimicry, can, be, considered, mutual, batesian, mimics, of, wasps, include, many, species, of, hoverfly, and, the, wasp, beetle, many, species, of, wasp, are, involved, in, m, llerian, mimicry, as, are, many, species, of, bee, while, wasp, stings, deter, many, potential, predators, bee, eaters, in, the, bird, family, meropidae, specialise, in, eating, stinging, insects, making, aerial, sallies, from, a, perch, to, catch, them, and, removing, the, venom, from, the, stinger, by, repeatedly, brushing, the, prey, firmly, against, a, hard,

foods, and, are, more, likely, to, come, into, contact, with, humans, wasp, nests, made, in, or, near, houses, such, as, in, roof, spaces, can, present, a, danger, as, the, wasps, may, sting, if, people, come, close, to, them, stings, are, usually, painful, rather, than, dangerous, but, in, rare, cases, people, may, suffer, life, threatening, anaphylactic, shock, some, species, of, parasitic, wasp, especially, in, groups, such, as, aphelinidae, braconidae, mymaridae, and, trichogrammatidae, are, exploited, commercially, to, provide, biological, control, of, insect, pests, one, of, the, first, species, to, be, used, was, encarsia, formosa, a, parasitoid, of, a, range, of, species, of, whitefly, it, entered, commercial, use, in, the, 1920s, in, europe, was, overtaken, by, chemical, pesticides, in, the, 1940s, and, again, received, interest, from, the, 1970s, encarsia, is, being, tested, in, greenhouses, to, control, whitefly, pests, of, tomato, and, cucumber, and, to, a, lesser, extent, of, aubergine, eggplant, flowers, such, as, marigold, and, strawberry, several, species, of, parasitic, wasp, are, natural, predators, of, aphids, and, can, help, to, control, them, for, instance, aphidius, matricariae, is, used, to, control, the, peach, potato, aphid, wasps, rfc, is, an, english, professional, rugby, union, team, originally, based, in, london, but, now, playing, in,
