cholesterol, is, the, principal, sterol, of, all, higher, animals, distributed, in, body, tissues, especially, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, and, in, animal, fats, and, oils, cholesterol, is, biosynthesized, by, all, animal, cells, and, is, an, essential, structural, component, of, animal, cell, membranes, in, vertebrates, hepatic, cells, typically, produce, the, greatest, amounts, in, the, brain, astrocytes, produce, cholesterol, and, transport, it, to, neurons, it, is, absent, among, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, although, there, are, some, exceptions, such, as, mycoplasma, which, require, cholesterol, for, growth, cholesterol, also, serves, as, a, precursor, for, the, biosynthesis, of, steroid, hormones, bile, acid, and, vitamin, d, elevated, levels, of, cholesterol, in, the, blood, especially, when, bound, to, low, density, lipoprotein, ldl, often, referred, to, as, bad, cholesterol, may, increase, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, fran, ois, poulletier, de, la, salle, first, identified, cholesterol, in, solid, form, in, gallstones, in, 1769, in, 1815, chemist, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, named, the, compound, cholesterine, the, word, cholesterol, comes, from, ancient, greek, chole, bile, and, stereos, solid, followed, by, the, chemical, suffix, ol, for, an, alcohol, cholesterol, is, essential, for, all, animal, life, while, most, cells, are, capable, of, synthesizing, it, the, majority, of, cholesterol, is, ingested, or, synthesized, by, hepatocytes, and, transported, in, the, blood, to, peripheral, cells, the, levels, of, cholesterol, in, peripheral, tissues, is, dictated, by, a, balance, of, uptake, and, export, under, normal, conditions, brain, cholesterol, is, separate, from, peripheral, cholesterol, i, e, the, dietary, and, hepatic, cholesterol, do, not, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, rather, astrocytes, produce, and, distribute, cholesterol, in, the, brain, de, novo, synthesis, both, in, astrocytes, and, hepatocytes, occurs, by, a, complex, 37, step, process, this, begins, with, the, mevalonate, or, hmg, coa, reductase, pathway, the, target, of, statin, drugs, which, encompasses, the, first, 18, steps, this, is, followed, by, 19, additional, steps, to, convert, the, resulting, lanosterol, into, cholesterol, a, human, male, weighing, 68, kg, 150, lb, normally, synthesizes, about, 1, gram, 1, 000, mg, of, cholesterol, per, day, and, his, body, contains, about, 35, g, mostly, contained, within, the, cell, membranes, typical, daily, cholesterol, dietary, intake, for, a, man, in, the, united, states, is, 307, mg, most, ingested, cholesterol, is, esterified, which, causes, it, to, be, poorly, absorbed, by, the, gut, the, body, also, compensates, for, absorption, of, ingested, cholesterol, by, reducing, its, own, cholesterol, synthesis, for, these, reasons, cholesterol, in, food, seven, to, ten, hours, after, ingestion, has, little, if, any, effect, on, concentrations, of, cholesterol, in, the, blood, surprisingly, in, rats, blood, cholesterol, is, inversely, correlated, with, cholesterol, consumption, the, more, cholesterol, a, rat, eats, the, lower, the, blood, cholesterol, during, the, first, seven, hours, after, ingestion, of, cholesterol, as, absorbed, fats, are, being, distributed, around, the, body, within, extracellular, water, by, the, various, lipoproteins, which, transport, all, fats, in, the, water, outside, cells, the, concentrations, increase, plants, make, cholesterol, in, very, small, amounts, in, larger, quantities, they, produce, phytosterols, chemically, similar, substances, which, can, compete, with, cholesterol, for, reabsorption, in, the, intestinal, tract, thus, potentially, reducing, cholesterol, reabsorption, when, intestinal, lining, cells, absorb, phytosterols, in, place, of, cholesterol, they, usually, excrete, the, phytosterol, molecules, back, into, the, gi, tract, an, important, protective, mechanism, the, intake, of, naturally, occurring, phytosterols, which, encompass, plant, sterols, and, stanols, ranges, between, 200, 300, mg, day, depending, on, eating, habits, specially, designed, vegetarian, experimental, diets, have, been, produced, yielding, upwards, of, 700, mg, day, cholesterol, is, present, in, varying, degrees, in, all, animal, cell, membranes, but, is, absent, in, prokaryotes, it, is, required, to, build, and, maintain, membranes, and, modulates, membrane, fluidity, over, the, range, of, physiological, temperatures, the, hydroxyl, group, of, each, cholesterol, molecule, interacts, with, water, molecules, surrounding, the, membrane, as, do, the, polar, heads, of, the, membrane, phospholipids, and, sphingolipids, while, the, bulky, steroid, and, the, hydrocarbon, chain, are, embedded, in, the, membrane, alongside, the, nonpolar, fatty, acid, chain, of, the, other, lipids, through, the, interaction, with, the, phospholipid, fatty, acid, chains, cholesterol, increases, membrane, packing, which, both, alters, membrane, fluidity, and, maintains, membrane, integrity, so, that, animal, cells, do, not, need, to, build, cell, walls, like, plants, and, most, bacteria, the, membrane, remains, stable, and, durable, without, being, rigid, allowing, animal, cells, to, change, shape, and, animals, to, move, the, structure, of, the, tetracyclic, ring, of, cholesterol, contributes, to, the, fluidity, of, the, cell, membrane, as, the, molecule, is, in, a, trans, conformation, making, all, but, the, side, chain, of, cholesterol, rigid, and, planar, in, this, structural, role, cholesterol, also, reduces, the, permeability, of, the, plasma, membrane, to, neutral, solutes, hydrogen, ions, and, sodium, ions, cholesterol, regulates, the, biological, process, of, substrate, presentation, and, the, enzymes, that, use, substrate, presentation, as, a, mechanism, of, their, activation, phospholipase, d2, pld2, is, a, well, defined, example, of, an, enzyme, activated, by, substrate, presentation, the, enzyme, is, palmitoylated, causing, the, enzyme, to, traffic, to, cholesterol, dependent, lipid, domains, sometimes, called, lipid, rafts, the, substrate, of, phospholipase, d, is, phosphatidylcholine, pc, which, is, unsaturated, and, is, of, low, abundance, in, lipid, rafts, pc, localizes, to, the, disordered, region, of, the, cell, along, with, the, polyunsaturated, lipid, phosphatidylinositol, 4, 5, bisphosphate, pip2, pld2, has, a, pip2, binding, domain, when, pip2, concentration, in, the, membrane, increases, pld2, leaves, the, cholesterol, dependent, domains, and, binds, to, pip2, where, it, then, gains, access, to, its, substrate, pc, and, commences, catalysis, based, on, substrate, presentation, cholesterol, is, also, implicated, in, cell, signaling, processes, assisting, in, the, formation, of, lipid, rafts, in, the, plasma, membrane, which, brings, receptor, proteins, in, close, proximity, with, high, concentrations, of, second, messenger, molecules, in, multiple, layers, cholesterol, and, phospholipids, both, electrical, insulators, can, facilitate, speed, of, transmission, of, electrical, impulses, along, nerve, tissue, for, many, neuron, fibers, a, myelin, sheath, rich, in, cholesterol, since, it, is, derived, from, compacted, layers, of, schwann, cell, or, oligodendrocyte, membranes, provides, insulation, for, more, efficient, conduction, of, impulses, demyelination, loss, of, myelin, is, believed, to, be, part, of, the, basis, for, multiple, sclerosis, cholesterol, binds, to, and, affects, the, gating, of, a, number, of, ion, channels, such, as, the, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptor, gaba, a, receptor, and, the, inward, rectifier, potassium, channel, cholesterol, also, activates, the, estrogen, related, receptor, alpha, err, and, may, be, the, endogenous, ligand, for, the, receptor, the, constitutively, active, nature, of, the, receptor, may, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, cholesterol, is, ubiquitous, in, the, body, inhibition, of, err, signaling, by, reduction, of, cholesterol, production, has, been, identified, as, a, key, mediator, of, the, effects, of, statins, and, bisphosphonates, on, bone, muscle, and, macrophages, on, the, basis, of, these, findings, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, err, should, be, de, orphanized, and, classified, as, a, receptor, for, cholesterol, within, cells, cholesterol, is, also, a, precursor, molecule, for, several, biochemical, pathways, for, example, it, is, the, precursor, molecule, for, the, synthesis, of, vitamin, d, in, the, calcium, metabolism, and, all, steroid, hormones, including, the, adrenal, gland, hormones, cortisol, and, aldosterone, as, well, as, the, sex, hormones, progesterone, estrogens, and, testosterone, and, their, derivatives, the, stratum, corneum, is, the, outermost, layer, of, the, epidermis, it, is, composed, of, terminally, differentiated, and, enucleated, corneocytes, that, reside, within, a, lipid, matrix, like, bricks, and, mortar, together, with, ceramides, and, free, fatty, acids, cholesterol, forms, the, lipid, mortar, a, water, impermeable, barrier, that, prevents, evaporative, water, loss, as, a, rule, of, thumb, the, epidermal, lipid, matrix, is, composed, of, an, equimolar, mixture, of, ceramides, 50, by, weight, cholesterol, 25, by, weight, and, free, fatty, acids, 15, by, weight, with, smaller, quantities, of, other, lipids, also, being, present, cholesterol, sulfate, reaches, its, highest, concentration, in, the, granular, layer, of, the, epidermis, steroid, sulfate, sulfatase, then, decreases, its, concentration, in, the, stratum, corneum, the, outermost, layer, of, the, epidermis, the, relative, abundance, of, cholesterol, sulfate, in, the, epidermis, varies, across, different, body, sites, with, the, heel, of, the, foot, having, the, lowest, concentration, cholesterol, is, recycled, in, the, body, the, liver, excretes, cholesterol, into, biliary, fluids, which, are, then, stored, in, the, gallbladder, which, then, excretes, them, in, a, non, esterified, form, via, bile, into, the, digestive, tract, typically, about, 50, of, the, excreted, cholesterol, is, reabsorbed, by, the, small, intestine, back, into, the, bloodstream, almost, all, animal, tissues, synthesize, cholesterol, from, acetyl, coa, all, animal, cells, exceptions, exist, within, the, invertebrates, manufacture, cholesterol, for, both, membrane, structure, and, other, uses, with, relative, production, rates, varying, by, cell, type, and, organ, function, about, 80, of, total, daily, cholesterol, production, occurs, in, the, liver, and, the, intestines, other, sites, of, higher, synthesis, rates, include, the, brain, the, adrenal, glands, and, the, reproductive, organs, synthesis, within, the, body, starts, with, the, mevalonate, pathway, where, two, molecules, of, acetyl, coa, condense, to, form, acetoacetyl, coa, this, is, followed, by, a, second, condensation, between, acetyl, coa, and, acetoacetyl, coa, to, form, 3, hydroxy, 3, methylglutaryl, coa, hmg, coa, this, molecule, is, then, reduced, to, mevalonate, by, the, enzyme, hmg, coa, reductase, production, of, mevalonate, is, the, rate, limiting, and, irreversible, step, in, cholesterol, synthesis, and, is, the, site, of, action, for, statins, a, class, of, cholesterol, lowering, drugs, mevalonate, is, finally, converted, to, isopentenyl, pyrophosphate, ipp, through, two, phosphorylation, steps, and, one, decarboxylation, step, that, requires, atp, three, molecules, of, isopentenyl, pyrophosphate, condense, to, form, farnesyl, pyrophosphate, through, the, action, of, geranyl, transferase, two, molecules, of, farnesyl, pyrophosphate, then, condense, to, form, squalene, by, the, action, of, squalene, synthase, in, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, oxidosqualene, cyclase, then, cyclizes, squalene, to, form, lanosterol, finally, lanosterol, is, converted, to, cholesterol, via, either, of, two, pathways, the, bloch, pathway, or, the, kandutsch, russell, pathway, the, final, 19, steps, to, cholesterol, contain, nadph, and, oxygen, to, help, oxidize, methyl, groups, for, removal, of, carbons, mutases, to, move, alkene, groups, and, nadh, to, help, reduce, ketones, konrad, bloch, and, feodor, lynen, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1964, for, their, discoveries, concerning, some, of, the, mechanisms, and, methods, of, regulation, of, cholesterol, and, fatty, acid, metabolism, biosynthesis, of, cholesterol, is, directly, regulated, by, the, cholesterol, levels, present, though, the, homeostatic, mechanisms, involved, are, only, partly, understood, a, higher, intake, of, food, leads, to, a, net, decrease, in, endogenous, production, whereas, a, lower, intake, of, food, has, the, opposite, effect, the, main, regulatory, mechanism, is, the, sensing, of, intracellular, cholesterol, in, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, by, the, protein, srebp, sterol, regulatory, element, binding, protein, 1, and, 2, in, the, presence, of, cholesterol, srebp, is, bound, to, two, other, proteins, scap, srebp, cleavage, activating, protein, and, insig, 1, when, cholesterol, levels, fall, insig, 1, dissociates, from, the, srebp, scap, complex, which, allows, the, complex, to, migrate, to, the, golgi, apparatus, here, srebp, is, cleaved, by, s1p, and, s2p, site, 1, protease, and, site, 2, protease, two, enzymes, that, are, activated, by, scap, when, cholesterol, levels, are, low, the, cleaved, srebp, then, migrates, to, the, nucleus, and, acts, as, a, transcription, factor, to, bind, to, the, sterol, regulatory, element, sre, which, stimulates, the, transcription, of, many, genes, among, these, are, the, low, density, lipoprotein, ldl, receptor, and, hmg, coa, reductase, the, ldl, receptor, scavenges, circulating, ldl, from, the, bloodstream, whereas, hmg, coa, reductase, leads, to, an, increase, in, endogenous, production, of, cholesterol, a, large, part, of, this, signaling, pathway, was, clarified, by, dr, michael, s, brown, and, dr, joseph, l, goldstein, in, the, 1970s, in, 1985, they, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, their, work, their, subsequent, work, shows, how, the, srebp, pathway, regulates, the, expression, of, many, genes, that, control, lipid, formation, and, metabolism, and, body, fuel, allocation, cholesterol, synthesis, can, also, be, turned, off, when, cholesterol, levels, are, high, hmg, coa, reductase, contains, both, a, cytosolic, domain, responsible, for, its, catalytic, function, and, a, membrane, domain, the, membrane, domain, senses, signals, for, its, degradation, increasing, concentrations, of, cholesterol, and, other, sterols, cause, a, change, in, this, domain, s, oligomerization, state, which, makes, it, more, susceptible, to, destruction, by, the, proteasome, this, enzyme, s, activity, can, also, be, reduced, by, phosphorylation, by, an, amp, activated, protein, kinase, because, this, kinase, is, activated, by, amp, which, is, produced, when, atp, is, hydrolyzed, it, follows, that, cholesterol, synthesis, is, halted, when, atp, levels, are, low, as, an, isolated, molecule, cholesterol, is, only, minimally, soluble, in, water, or, hydrophilic, because, of, this, it, dissolves, in, blood, at, exceedingly, small, concentrations, to, be, transported, effectively, cholesterol, is, instead, packaged, within, lipoproteins, complex, discoidal, particles, with, exterior, amphiphilic, proteins, and, lipids, whose, outward, facing, surfaces, are, water, soluble, and, inward, facing, surfaces, are, lipid, soluble, this, allows, it, to, travel, through, the, blood, via, emulsification, unbound, cholesterol, being, amphipathic, is, transported, in, the, monolayer, surface, of, the, lipoprotein, particle, along, with, phospholipids, and, proteins, cholesterol, esters, bound, to, fatty, acid, on, the, other, hand, are, transported, within, the, fatty, hydrophobic, core, of, the, lipoprotein, along, with, triglyceride, there, are, several, types, of, lipoproteins, in, the, blood, in, order, of, increasing, density, they, are, chylomicrons, very, low, density, lipoprotein, vldl, intermediate, density, lipoprotein, idl, low, density, lipoprotein, ldl, and, high, density, lipoprotein, hdl, lower, protein, lipid, ratios, make, for, less, dense, lipoproteins, cholesterol, within, different, lipoproteins, is, identical, although, some, is, carried, as, its, native, free, alcohol, form, the, cholesterol, oh, group, facing, the, water, surrounding, the, particles, while, others, as, fatty, acyl, esters, known, also, as, cholesterol, esters, within, the, particles, lipoprotein, particles, are, organized, by, complex, apolipoproteins, typically, 80, 100, different, proteins, per, particle, which, can, be, recognized, and, bound, by, specific, receptors, on, cell, membranes, directing, their, lipid, payload, into, specific, cells, and, tissues, currently, ingesting, these, fat, transport, particles, these, surface, receptors, serve, as, unique, molecular, signatures, which, then, help, determine, fat, distribution, delivery, throughout, the, body, chylomicrons, the, least, dense, cholesterol, transport, particles, contain, apolipoprotein, b, 48, apolipoprotein, c, and, apolipoprotein, e, the, principal, cholesterol, carrier, in, the, brain, in, their, shells, chylomicrons, carry, fats, from, the, intestine, to, muscle, and, other, tissues, in, need, of, fatty, acids, for, energy, or, fat, production, unused, cholesterol, remains, in, more, cholesterol, rich, chylomicron, remnants, and, is, taken, up, from, here, to, the, bloodstream, by, the, liver, vldl, particles, are, produced, by, the, liver, from, triacylglycerol, and, cholesterol, which, was, not, used, in, the, synthesis, of, bile, acids, these, particles, contain, apolipoprotein, b100, and, apolipoprotein, e, in, their, shells, and, can, be, degraded, by, lipoprotein, lipase, on, the, artery, wall, to, idl, this, arterial, wall, cleavage, allows, absorption, of, triacylglycerol, and, increases, the, concentration, of, circulating, cholesterol, idl, particles, are, then, consumed, in, two, processes, half, is, metabolized, by, htgl, and, taken, up, by, the, ldl, receptor, on, the, liver, cell, surfaces, while, the, other, half, continues, to, lose, triacylglycerols, in, the, bloodstream, until, they, become, cholesterol, laden, ldl, particles, ldl, particles, are, the, major, blood, cholesterol, carriers, each, one, contains, approximately, 1, 500, molecules, of, cholesterol, ester, ldl, particle, shells, contain, just, one, molecule, of, apolipoprotein, b100, recognized, by, ldl, receptors, in, peripheral, tissues, upon, binding, of, apolipoprotein, b100, many, ldl, receptors, concentrate, in, clathrin, coated, pits, both, ldl, and, its, receptor, form, vesicles, within, a, cell, via, endocytosis, these, vesicles, then, fuse, with, a, lysosome, where, the, lysosomal, acid, lipase, enzyme, hydrolyzes, the, cholesterol, esters, the, cholesterol, can, then, be, used, for, membrane, biosynthesis, or, esterified, and, stored, within, the, cell, so, as, to, not, interfere, with, the, cell, membranes, ldl, receptors, are, used, up, during, cholesterol, absorption, and, its, synthesis, is, regulated, by, srebp, the, same, protein, that, controls, the, synthesis, of, cholesterol, de, novo, according, to, its, presence, inside, the, cell, a, cell, with, abundant, cholesterol, will, have, its, ldl, receptor, synthesis, blocked, to, prevent, new, cholesterol, in, ldl, particles, from, being, taken, up, conversely, ldl, receptor, synthesis, proceeds, when, a, cell, is, deficient, in, cholesterol, when, this, process, becomes, unregulated, ldl, particles, without, receptors, begin, to, appear, in, the, blood, these, ldl, particles, are, oxidized, and, taken, up, by, macrophages, which, become, engorged, and, form, foam, cells, these, foam, cells, often, become, trapped, in, the, walls, of, blood, vessels, and, contribute, to, atherosclerotic, plaque, formation, differences, in, cholesterol, homeostasis, affect, the, development, of, early, atherosclerosis, carotid, intima, media, thickness, these, plaques, are, the, main, causes, of, heart, attacks, strokes, and, other, serious, medical, problems, leading, to, the, association, of, so, called, ldl, cholesterol, actually, a, lipoprotein, with, bad, cholesterol, hdl, particles, are, thought, to, transport, cholesterol, back, to, the, liver, either, for, excretion, or, for, other, tissues, that, synthesize, hormones, in, a, process, known, as, reverse, cholesterol, transport, rct, large, numbers, of, hdl, particles, correlates, with, better, health, outcomes, whereas, low, numbers, of, hdl, particles, is, associated, with, atheromatous, disease, progression, in, the, arteries, cholesterol, is, susceptible, to, oxidation, and, easily, forms, oxygenated, derivatives, called, oxysterols, three, different, mechanisms, can, form, these, autoxidation, secondary, oxidation, to, lipid, peroxidation, and, cholesterol, metabolizing, enzyme, oxidation, a, great, interest, in, oxysterols, arose, when, they, were, shown, to, exert, inhibitory, actions, on, cholesterol, biosynthesis, this, finding, became, known, as, the, oxysterol, hypothesis, additional, roles, for, oxysterols, in, human, physiology, include, their, participation, in, bile, acid, biosynthesis, function, as, transport, forms, of, cholesterol, and, regulation, of, gene, transcription, in, biochemical, experiments, radiolabelled, forms, of, cholesterol, such, as, tritiated, cholesterol, are, used, these, derivatives, undergo, degradation, upon, storage, and, it, is, essential, to, purify, cholesterol, prior, to, use, cholesterol, can, be, purified, using, small, sephadex, lh, 20, columns, cholesterol, is, oxidized, by, the, liver, into, a, variety, of, bile, acids, these, in, turn, are, conjugated, with, glycine, taurine, glucuronic, acid, or, sulfate, a, mixture, of, conjugated, and, nonconjugated, bile, acids, along, with, cholesterol, itself, is, excreted, from, the, liver, into, the, bile, approximately, 95, of, the, bile, acids, are, reabsorbed, from, the, intestines, and, the, remainder, are, lost, in, the, feces, the, excretion, and, reabsorption, of, bile, acids, forms, the, basis, of, the, enterohepatic, circulation, which, is, essential, for, the, digestion, and, absorption, of, dietary, fats, under, certain, circumstances, when, more, concentrated, as, in, the, gallbladder, cholesterol, crystallises, and, is, the, major, constituent, of, most, gallstones, lecithin, and, bilirubin, gallstones, also, occur, but, less, frequently, every, day, up, to, 1, g, of, cholesterol, enters, the, colon, this, cholesterol, originates, from, the, diet, bile, and, desquamated, intestinal, cells, and, it, can, be, metabolized, by, the, colonic, bacteria, cholesterol, is, converted, mainly, into, coprostanol, a, nonabsorbable, sterol, that, is, excreted, in, the, feces, although, cholesterol, is, a, steroid, generally, associated, with, mammals, the, human, pathogen, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, is, able, to, completely, degrade, this, molecule, and, contains, a, large, number, of, genes, that, are, regulated, by, its, presence, many, of, these, cholesterol, regulated, genes, are, homologues, of, fatty, acid, oxidation, genes, but, have, evolved, in, such, a, way, as, to, bind, large, steroid, substrates, like, cholesterol, animal, fats, are, complex, mixtures, of, triglycerides, with, lesser, amounts, of, both, the, phospholipids, and, cholesterol, molecules, from, which, all, animal, and, human, cell, membranes, are, constructed, since, all, animal, cells, manufacture, cholesterol, all, animal, based, foods, contain, cholesterol, in, varying, amounts, major, dietary, sources, of, cholesterol, include, red, meat, egg, yolks, and, whole, eggs, liver, kidney, giblets, fish, oil, and, butter, human, breast, milk, also, contains, significant, quantities, of, cholesterol, plant, cells, synthesize, cholesterol, as, a, precursor, for, other, compounds, such, as, phytosterols, and, steroidal, glycoalkaloids, with, cholesterol, remaining, in, plant, foods, only, in, minor, amounts, or, absent, some, plant, foods, such, as, avocado, flax, seeds, and, peanuts, contain, phytosterols, which, compete, with, cholesterol, for, absorption, in, the, intestines, and, reduce, the, absorption, of, both, dietary, and, bile, cholesterol, a, typical, diet, contributes, on, the, order, of, 0, 2, gram, of, phytosterols, which, is, not, enough, to, have, a, significant, impact, on, blocking, cholesterol, absorption, phytosterols, intake, can, be, supplemented, through, the, use, of, phytosterol, containing, functional, foods, or, dietary, supplements, that, are, recognized, as, having, potential, to, reduce, levels, of, ldl, cholesterol, in, 2015, the, scientific, advisory, panel, of, u, s, department, of, health, and, human, services, and, u, s, department, of, agriculture, for, the, 2015, iteration, of, the, dietary, guidelines, for, americans, dropped, the, previously, recommended, limit, of, consumption, of, dietary, cholesterol, to, 300, mg, per, day, with, a, new, recommendation, to, eat, as, little, dietary, cholesterol, as, possible, thereby, acknowledging, an, association, between, a, diet, low, in, cholesterol, and, reduced, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, a, 2013, report, by, the, american, heart, association, and, the, american, college, of, cardiology, recommended, focusing, on, healthy, dietary, patterns, rather, than, specific, cholesterol, limits, as, they, are, hard, for, clinicians, and, consumers, to, implement, they, recommend, the, dash, and, mediterranean, diet, which, are, low, in, cholesterol, a, 2017, review, by, the, american, heart, association, recommends, switching, saturated, fats, for, polyunsaturated, fats, to, reduce, cardiovascular, disease, risk, some, supplemental, guidelines, have, recommended, doses, of, phytosterols, in, the, 1, 6, 3, 0, grams, per, day, range, health, canada, efsa, atp, iii, fda, a, meta, analysis, demonstrated, a, 12, reduction, in, ldl, cholesterol, at, a, mean, dose, of, 2, 1, grams, per, day, the, benefits, of, a, diet, supplemented, with, phytosterols, have, also, been, questioned, according, to, the, lipid, hypothesis, elevated, levels, of, cholesterol, in, the, blood, lead, to, atherosclerosis, which, may, increase, the, risk, of, heart, attack, stroke, and, peripheral, artery, disease, since, higher, blood, ldl, especially, higher, ldl, concentrations, and, smaller, ldl, particle, size, contributes, to, this, process, more, than, the, cholesterol, content, of, the, hdl, particles, ldl, particles, are, often, termed, bad, cholesterol, high, concentrations, of, functional, hdl, which, can, remove, cholesterol, from, cells, and, atheromas, offer, protection, and, are, commonly, referred, to, as, good, cholesterol, these, balances, are, mostly, genetically, determined, but, can, be, changed, by, body, composition, medications, diet, and, other, factors, a, 2007, study, demonstrated, that, blood, total, cholesterol, levels, have, an, exponential, effect, on, cardiovascular, and, total, mortality, with, the, association, more, pronounced, in, younger, subjects, because, cardiovascular, disease, is, relatively, rare, in, the, younger, population, the, impact, of, high, cholesterol, on, health, is, larger, in, older, people, elevated, levels, of, the, lipoprotein, fractions, ldl, idl, and, vldl, rather, than, the, total, cholesterol, level, correlate, with, the, extent, and, progress, of, atherosclerosis, conversely, the, total, cholesterol, can, be, within, normal, limits, yet, be, made, up, primarily, of, small, ldl, and, small, hdl, particles, under, which, conditions, atheroma, growth, rates, are, high, a, post, hoc, analysis, of, the, ideal, and, the, epic, prospective, studies, found, an, association, between, high, levels, of, hdl, cholesterol, adjusted, for, apolipoprotein, a, i, and, apolipoprotein, b, and, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, casting, doubt, on, the, cardioprotective, role, of, good, cholesterol, about, one, in, 250, individuals, can, have, a, genetic, mutation, for, the, ldl, cholesterol, receptor, that, causes, them, to, have, familial, hypercholesterolemia, inherited, high, cholesterol, can, also, include, genetic, mutations, in, the, pcsk9, gene, and, the, gene, for, apolipoprotein, b, elevated, cholesterol, levels, are, treatable, by, a, diet, that, reduces, or, eliminates, saturated, fat, trans, fats, and, high, cholesterol, foods, often, followed, by, one, of, various, hypolipidemic, agents, such, as, statins, fibrates, cholesterol, absorption, inhibitors, monoclonal, antibody, therapy, pcsk9, inhibitors, nicotinic, acid, derivatives, or, bile, acid, sequestrants, there, are, several, international, guidelines, on, the, treatment, of, hypercholesterolemia, human, trials, using, hmg, coa, reductase, inhibitors, known, as, statins, have, repeatedly, confirmed, that, changing, lipoprotein, transport, patterns, from, unhealthy, to, healthier, patterns, significantly, lowers, cardiovascular, disease, event, rates, even, for, people, with, cholesterol, values, currently, considered, low, for, adults, studies, have, shown, that, reducing, ldl, cholesterol, levels, by, about, 38, 7, mg, dl, with, the, use, of, statins, can, reduce, cardiovascular, disease, and, stroke, risk, by, about, 21, studies, have, also, found, that, statins, reduce, atheroma, progression, as, a, result, people, with, a, history, of, cardiovascular, disease, may, derive, benefit, from, statins, irrespective, of, their, cholesterol, levels, total, cholesterol, below, 5, 0, mmol, l, and, in, men, without, cardiovascular, disease, there, is, benefit, from, lowering, abnormally, high, cholesterol, levels, primary, prevention, primary, prevention, in, women, was, originally, practiced, only, by, extension, of, the, findings, in, studies, on, men, since, in, women, none, of, the, large, statin, trials, conducted, prior, to, 2007, demonstrated, a, significant, reduction, in, overall, mortality, or, in, cardiovascular, endpoints, meta, analyses, have, demonstrated, significant, reductions, in, all, cause, and, cardiovascular, mortality, without, significant, heterogeneity, by, sex, the, 1987, report, of, national, cholesterol, education, program, adult, treatment, panels, suggests, the, total, blood, cholesterol, level, should, be, 200, mg, dl, normal, blood, cholesterol, 200, 239, mg, dl, borderline, high, 240, mg, dl, high, cholesterol, the, american, heart, association, provides, a, similar, set, of, guidelines, for, total, fasting, blood, cholesterol, levels, and, risk, for, heart, disease, statins, are, effective, in, lowering, ldl, cholesterol, and, widely, used, for, primary, prevention, in, people, at, high, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, as, well, as, in, secondary, prevention, for, those, who, have, developed, cardiovascular, disease, the, average, global, mean, total, cholesterol, for, humans, has, remained, at, about, 4, 6, mmol, l, 178, mg, dl, for, men, and, women, both, crude, and, age, standardized, for, nearly, 40, years, from, 1980, to, 2018, with, some, regional, variations, and, reduction, of, total, cholesterol, in, western, nations, more, current, testing, methods, determine, ldl, bad, and, hdl, good, cholesterol, separately, allowing, cholesterol, analysis, to, be, more, nuanced, the, desirable, ldl, level, is, considered, to, be, less, than, 100, mg, dl, 2, 6, mmol, l, total, cholesterol, is, defined, as, the, sum, of, hdl, ldl, and, vldl, usually, only, the, total, hdl, and, triglycerides, are, measured, for, cost, reasons, the, vldl, is, usually, estimated, as, one, fifth, of, the, triglycerides, and, the, ldl, is, estimated, using, the, friedewald, formula, or, a, variant, estimated, ldl, direct, ldl, measures, are, used, when, triglycerides, exceed, 400, mg, dl, the, estimated, vldl, and, ldl, have, more, error, when, triglycerides, are, above, 400, mg, dl, in, the, framingham, heart, study, each, 10, mg, dl, 0, 6, mmol, l, increase, in, total, cholesterol, levels, increased, 30, year, overall, mortality, by, 5, and, cvd, mortality, by, 9, while, subjects, over, the, age, of, 50, had, an, 11, increase, in, overall, mortality, and, a, 14, increase, in, cardiovascular, disease, mortality, per, 1, mg, dl, 0, 06, mmol, l, year, drop, in, total, cholesterol, levels, the, researchers, attributed, this, phenomenon, to, a, different, correlation, whereby, the, disease, itself, increases, risk, of, death, as, well, as, changes, a, myriad, of, factors, such, as, weight, loss, and, the, inability, to, eat, which, lower, serum, cholesterol, this, effect, was, also, shown, in, men, of, all, ages, and, women, over, 50, in, the, vorarlberg, health, monitoring, and, promotion, programme, these, groups, were, more, likely, to, die, of, cancer, liver, diseases, and, mental, diseases, with, very, low, total, cholesterol, of, 186, mg, dl, 10, 3, mmol, l, and, lower, this, result, indicates, the, low, cholesterol, effect, occurs, even, among, younger, respondents, contradicting, the, previous, assessment, among, cohorts, of, older, people, that, this, is, a, marker, for, frailty, occurring, with, age, abnormally, low, levels, of, cholesterol, are, termed, hypocholesterolemia, research, into, the, causes, of, this, state, is, relatively, limited, but, some, studies, suggest, a, link, with, depression, cancer, and, cerebral, hemorrhage, in, general, the, low, cholesterol, levels, seem, to, be, a, consequence, rather, than, a, cause, of, an, underlying, illness, a, genetic, defect, in, cholesterol, synthesis, causes, smith, lemli, opitz, syndrome, which, is, often, associated, with, low, plasma, cholesterol, levels, hyperthyroidism, or, any, other, endocrine, disturbance, which, causes, upregulation, of, the, ldl, receptor, may, result, in, hypocholesterolemia, the, american, heart, association, recommends, testing, cholesterol, every, 4, 6, years, for, people, aged, 20, years, or, older, a, separate, set, of, american, heart, association, guidelines, issued, in, 2013, indicates, that, people, taking, statin, medications, should, have, their, cholesterol, tested, 4, 12, weeks, after, their, first, dose, and, then, every, 3, 12, months, thereafter, for, men, ages, 45, to, 65, and, women, ages, 55, to, 65, a, cholesterol, test, should, occur, every, 1, 2, years, and, for, seniors, over, age, 65,
