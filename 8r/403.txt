see, text, scale, insects, are, small, insects, of, the, order, hemiptera, suborder, sternorrhyncha, of, dramatically, variable, appearance, and, extreme, sexual, dimorphism, they, comprise, the, infraorder, coccomorpha, which, is, considered, a, more, convenient, grouping, than, the, superfamily, coccoidea, due, to, taxonomic, uncertainties, adult, females, typically, have, soft, bodies, and, no, limbs, and, are, concealed, underneath, domed, scales, extruding, quantities, of, wax, for, protection, some, species, are, hermaphroditic, with, a, combined, ovotestis, instead, of, separate, ovaries, and, testes, males, in, the, species, where, they, occur, have, legs, and, sometimes, wings, and, resemble, small, flies, scale, insects, are, herbivores, piercing, plant, tissues, with, their, mouthparts, and, remaining, in, one, place, feeding, on, sap, the, excess, fluid, they, imbibe, is, secreted, as, honeydew, on, which, sooty, mold, tends, to, grow, the, insects, often, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, ants, which, feed, on, the, honeydew, and, protect, them, from, predators, there, are, about, 8, 000, described, species, the, oldest, fossils, of, the, group, date, to, the, late, jurassic, preserved, in, amber, they, were, already, substantially, diversified, by, the, early, cretaceous, suggesting, an, earlier, origin, during, the, triassic, or, jurassic, their, closest, relatives, are, the, jumping, plant, lice, whiteflies, phylloxera, bugs, and, aphids, the, majority, of, female, scale, insects, remain, in, one, place, as, adults, with, newly, hatched, nymphs, known, as, crawlers, being, the, only, mobile, life, stage, apart, from, the, short, lived, males, the, reproductive, strategies, of, many, species, include, at, least, some, amount, of, asexual, reproduction, by, parthenogenesis, some, scale, insects, are, serious, commercial, pests, notably, the, cottony, cushion, scale, icerya, purchasi, on, citrus, fruit, trees, they, are, difficult, to, control, as, the, scale, and, waxy, covering, protect, them, effectively, from, contact, insecticides, some, species, are, used, for, biological, control, of, pest, plants, such, as, the, prickly, pear, opuntia, others, produce, commercially, valuable, substances, including, carmine, and, kermes, dyes, and, shellac, lacquer, the, two, red, colour, names, crimson, and, scarlet, both, derive, from, the, names, of, kermes, products, in, other, languages, scale, insects, vary, dramatically, in, appearance, from, very, small, organisms, 1, 2, mm, that, grow, beneath, wax, covers, some, shaped, like, oysters, others, like, mussel, shells, to, shiny, pearl, like, objects, about, 5, mm, to, animals, covered, with, mealy, wax, adult, females, are, almost, always, immobile, apart, from, mealybugs, and, permanently, attached, to, the, plant, on, which, they, are, feeding, they, secrete, a, waxy, coating, for, defence, making, them, resemble, reptilian, or, fish, scales, and, giving, them, their, common, name, the, key, character, that, sets, apart, the, coccomorpha, from, all, other, hemiptera, is, the, single, segmented, tarsus, on, the, legs, with, only, one, claw, at, the, tip, the, group, is, extremely, sexually, dimorphic, female, scale, insects, unusually, for, hemiptera, retain, the, immature, external, morphology, even, when, sexually, mature, a, condition, known, as, neoteny, adult, females, are, pear, shaped, elliptical, or, circular, with, no, wings, and, usually, no, constriction, separating, the, head, from, the, body, segmentation, of, the, body, is, indistinct, but, may, be, indicated, by, the, presence, of, marginal, bristles, legs, are, absent, in, the, females, of, some, families, and, when, present, vary, from, single, segment, stubs, to, five, segmented, limbs, female, scale, insects, have, no, compound, eyes, but, ocelli, simple, eyes, are, sometimes, present, in, margarodidae, ortheziidae, and, phenacoleachiidae, the, family, beesoniidae, lacks, antennae, but, other, families, possess, antennae, with, from, one, to, thirteen, segments, the, mouthparts, are, adapted, for, piercing, and, sucking, adult, males, in, contrast, have, the, typical, head, thorax, and, abdomen, of, other, insect, groups, and, are, so, different, from, females, that, pairing, them, as, a, species, is, challenging, they, are, usually, slender, insects, resembling, aphids, or, small, flies, they, have, antennae, with, nine, or, ten, segments, compound, eyes, margarodidae, and, ortheziidae, or, simple, eyes, most, other, families, and, legs, with, five, segments, most, species, have, wings, and, in, some, generations, may, alternate, between, being, winged, and, wingless, adult, males, do, not, feed, and, die, within, two, or, three, days, of, emergence, in, species, with, winged, males, generally, only, the, forewings, are, fully, functional, this, is, unusual, among, insects, it, most, closely, resembles, the, situation, in, the, true, flies, the, diptera, however, the, diptera, and, hemiptera, are, not, closely, related, and, do, not, closely, resemble, each, other, in, morphology, for, example, the, tail, filaments, of, the, coccomorpha, do, not, resemble, anything, in, the, morphology, of, flies, the, hind, metathoracic, wings, are, reduced, commonly, to, the, point, that, they, can, easily, be, overlooked, in, some, species, the, hind, wings, have, hamuli, hooklets, that, couple, the, hind, wings, to, the, main, wings, as, in, the, hymenoptera, the, vestigial, wings, are, often, reduced, to, pseudo, halteres, club, like, appendages, but, these, are, not, homologous, with, the, control, organs, of, diptera, and, it, is, not, clear, whether, they, have, any, substantial, control, function, hermaphroditism, is, very, rare, in, insects, but, several, species, of, icerya, exhibit, an, unusual, form, the, adult, possesses, an, ovotestis, consisting, of, both, female, and, male, reproductive, tissue, and, sperm, is, transmitted, to, the, young, for, their, future, use, the, fact, that, a, new, population, can, be, founded, by, a, single, individual, may, have, contributed, to, the, success, of, the, cottony, cushion, scale, which, has, spread, around, the, world, female, scale, insects, in, more, advanced, families, develop, from, the, egg, through, a, first, instar, crawler, stage, and, a, second, instar, stage, before, becoming, adult, in, more, primitive, families, there, is, an, additional, instar, stage, males, pass, through, a, first, and, second, instar, stage, a, pre, pupal, and, a, pupal, stage, before, adulthood, actually, a, pseudopupa, as, only, holometabolous, insects, have, a, true, pupa, the, first, instars, of, most, species, of, scale, insects, emerge, from, the, egg, with, functional, legs, and, are, informally, called, crawlers, they, immediately, crawl, around, in, search, of, a, suitable, spot, to, settle, down, and, feed, in, some, species, they, delay, settling, down, either, until, they, are, starving, or, until, they, have, been, blown, away, by, wind, onto, what, presumably, is, another, plant, where, they, may, establish, a, new, colony, there, are, many, variations, on, such, themes, such, as, scale, insects, that, are, associated, with, species, of, ants, that, act, as, herders, and, carry, the, young, ones, to, protected, sites, to, feed, in, either, case, many, such, species, of, crawlers, when, they, moult, lose, the, use, of, their, legs, if, they, are, female, and, stay, put, for, life, only, the, males, retain, legs, and, in, some, species, wings, and, use, them, in, seeking, females, to, do, this, they, usually, walk, as, their, ability, to, fly, is, limited, but, they, may, get, carried, to, new, locations, by, the, wind, adult, females, of, the, families, margarodidae, ortheziidae, and, pseudococcidae, are, mobile, and, can, move, to, other, parts, of, the, host, plant, or, even, adjoining, plants, but, the, mobile, period, is, limited, to, a, short, period, between, moults, some, of, these, overwinter, in, crevices, in, the, bark, or, among, plant, litter, moving, in, spring, to, tender, young, growth, however, the, majority, of, female, scale, insects, are, sedentary, as, adults, their, dispersal, ability, depends, on, how, far, a, crawler, can, crawl, before, it, needs, to, shed, its, skin, and, start, feeding, there, are, various, strategies, for, dealing, with, deciduous, trees, on, these, males, often, feed, on, the, leaves, usually, beside, the, veins, while, females, select, the, twigs, where, there, are, several, generations, in, the, year, there, may, be, a, general, retreat, onto, the, twigs, as, fall, approaches, on, branches, the, underside, is, usually, preferred, as, giving, protection, against, predation, and, adverse, weather, the, solenopsis, mealybug, feeds, on, the, foliage, of, its, host, in, summer, and, the, roots, in, winter, and, large, numbers, of, scale, species, feed, invisibly, year, round, on, roots, scale, insects, show, a, very, wide, range, of, variations, in, the, genetics, of, sex, determination, and, the, modes, of, reproduction, besides, sexual, reproduction, a, number, of, different, forms, of, reproductive, systems, are, employed, including, asexual, reproduction, by, parthenogenesis, in, some, species, sexual, and, asexual, populations, are, found, in, different, locations, and, in, general, species, with, a, wide, geographic, range, and, a, diversity, of, plant, hosts, are, more, likely, to, be, asexual, large, population, size, is, hypothesized, to, protect, an, asexual, population, from, becoming, extinct, but, nevertheless, parthenogenesis, is, uncommon, among, scale, insects, with, the, most, widespread, generalist, feeders, reproducing, sexually, the, majority, of, these, being, pest, species, many, species, have, the, xx, xo, system, where, the, female, is, diploid, and, homogametic, while, the, male, is, heterogametic, and, missing, a, sex, chromosome, in, some, diaspididae, and, pseudococcidae, both, sexes, are, produced, from, fertilized, eggs, but, during, development, males, eliminate, the, paternal, genome, and, this, system, called, paternal, genome, elimination, pge, is, found, in, nearly, 14, scale, insect, families, this, elimination, is, achieved, with, several, variations, the, commonest, known, as, the, lecanoid, system, involved, deactivation, of, the, paternal, genome, and, elimination, at, the, time, of, sperm, production, in, males, this, is, seen, in, pseudococcidae, kerriidae, and, some, eriococcidae, in, the, other, variant, or, comstockiella, system, the, somatic, cells, have, the, paternal, genome, untouched, a, third, variant, found, in, diaspididae, involves, the, paternal, genome, being, completely, removed, at, an, early, stage, making, males, haploid, both, in, somatic, and, germ, cells, even, though, they, are, formed, from, diploids, i, e, from, fertilized, eggs, in, addition, to, this, there, is, also, true, haplodiploidy, with, females, born, from, fertilized, eggs, and, males, from, unfertilized, eggs, this, is, seen, in, the, genus, icerya, in, parthenolecanium, males, are, born, from, unfertilized, eggs, but, diploidy, is, briefly, restored, by, fusion, of, haploid, cleave, nuclei, and, then, one, sex, chromosome, is, lost, through, heterochromatinization, females, can, reproduce, parthenogenetically, with, six, different, variants, based, on, whether, males, are, entirely, absent, or, not, obligate, v, facultative, parthenogenesis, the, sex, of, fertilized, v, unfertilized, eggs, and, based, on, how, diploidy, is, restored, in, unfertilized, eggs, the, evolution, of, these, systems, are, thought, to, be, the, result, of, intra, genomic, conflict, as, well, as, possibly, inter, genomic, conflict, with, endosymbionts, under, varied, selection, pressures, the, diversity, of, systems, has, made, scale, insects, ideal, models, for, research, scale, insects, are, an, ancient, group, having, originated, in, the, cretaceous, the, period, in, which, angiosperms, came, to, dominance, among, plants, with, only, a, few, groups, species, found, on, gymnosperms, they, feed, on, a, wide, variety, of, plants, but, are, unable, to, survive, long, away, from, their, hosts, while, some, specialise, on, a, single, plant, species, monophagous, and, some, on, a, single, genus, or, plant, family, oligophagous, others, are, less, specialised, and, feed, on, several, plant, groups, polyphagous, the, parasite, biologist, robert, poulin, notes, that, the, feeding, behaviour, of, scale, insects, closely, resembles, that, of, ectoparasites, living, on, the, outside, of, their, host, and, feeding, only, on, them, even, if, they, have, not, traditionally, been, so, described, in, his, view, those, species, that, remain, immobile, on, a, single, host, and, feed, only, on, it, behave, as, obligate, ectoparasites, for, example, cochineal, species, are, restricted, to, cactus, hosts, and, the, gall, inducing, apiomorpha, are, restricted, to, eucalyptus, some, species, have, certain, habitat, requirements, some, ortheziidae, occur, in, damp, meadows, among, mosses, and, in, woodland, soil, and, the, boreal, ensign, scale, newsteadia, floccosa, inhabits, plant, litter, a, hawaiian, mealybug, clavicoccus, erinaceus, that, fed, solely, on, the, now, critically, endangered, abutilon, sandwicense, has, gone, extinct, as, has, another, species, phyllococcus, oahuensis, several, other, monophagous, scale, insects, especially, those, on, islands, are, threatened, by, coextinction, due, to, threats, faced, by, their, host, plants, most, scale, insects, are, herbivores, feeding, on, phloem, sap, drawn, directly, from, the, plant, s, vascular, system, but, a, few, species, feed, on, fungal, mats, and, fungi, such, as, some, species, in, the, genus, newsteadia, in, the, family, ortheziidae, plant, sap, provides, a, liquid, diet, which, is, rich, in, sugar, and, non, essential, amino, acids, in, order, to, make, up, for, the, shortage, of, essential, amino, acids, they, depend, on, endosymbiotic, proteobacteria, scale, insects, secrete, a, large, quantity, of, sticky, viscid, fluid, known, as, honeydew, this, includes, sugars, amino, acids, and, minerals, and, is, attractive, to, ants, as, well, as, acting, as, a, substrate, on, which, sooty, mould, can, grow, the, mould, can, reduce, photosynthesis, by, the, leaves, and, detracts, from, the, appearance, of, ornamental, plants, the, scale, s, activities, can, result, in, stress, for, the, plant, causing, reduced, growth, and, giving, it, a, greater, susceptibility, to, plant, diseases, scale, insects, in, the, genus, cryptostigma, live, inside, the, nests, of, neotropical, ant, species, many, tropical, plants, need, ants, to, survive, which, in, turn, cultivate, scale, insects, thus, forming, a, tripartite, symbiosis, some, ants, and, scale, insects, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, the, ants, feed, on, the, honeydew, and, in, return, protect, the, scales, on, a, tulip, tree, ants, have, been, observed, building, a, papery, tent, over, the, scales, in, other, instances, scale, insects, are, carried, inside, the, ant, s, nest, the, ant, acropyga, exsanguis, takes, this, to, an, extreme, by, transporting, a, fertilised, female, mealybug, with, it, on, its, nuptial, flight, so, that, the, nest, it, founds, can, be, provisioned, this, provides, a, means, for, the, mealybug, to, be, dispersed, widely, species, of, hippeococcus, have, long, clinging, legs, with, claws, to, grip, the, dolichoderus, ants, which, tend, them, they, allow, themselves, to, be, carried, into, the, ant, colony, here, the, mealybugs, are, safe, from, predation, and, environmental, hazards, while, the, ants, have, a, source, of, nourishment, another, species, of, ant, maintains, a, herd, of, scale, insects, inside, the, hollow, stems, of, a, barteria, tree, the, scale, insects, feed, on, the, sap, and, the, ants, while, benefiting, from, the, honeydew, drive, away, other, herbivorous, insects, from, the, tree, as, well, as, preventing, vines, from, smothering, it, scale, insects, have, various, natural, enemies, and, research, in, this, field, is, largely, directed, at, the, species, that, are, crop, pests, entomopathogenic, fungi, can, attack, suitable, scales, and, completely, overgrow, them, the, identity, of, the, host, is, not, always, apparent, as, many, fungi, are, host, specific, and, may, destroy, all, the, scales, of, one, species, present, on, a, leaf, while, not, affecting, another, species, fungi, in, the, genus, septobasidium, have, a, more, complex, mutualistic, relationship, with, scale, insects, the, fungus, lives, on, trees, where, it, forms, a, mat, which, overgrows, the, scales, reducing, the, growth, of, the, individual, parasitised, scales, and, sometimes, rendering, them, infertile, but, protecting, the, scale, colony, from, environmental, conditions, and, predators, the, fungus, benefits, by, metabolising, the, sap, extracted, from, the, tree, by, the, insects, natural, enemies, include, parasitoid, wasps, mostly, in, the, families, encyrtidae, and, eulophidae, and, predatory, beetles, such, as, fungus, weevils, ladybirds, and, sap, beetles, ladybirds, feed, on, aphids, and, scale, insects, laying, their, eggs, near, their, prey, to, ensure, their, larvae, have, immediate, access, to, food, the, ladybird, cryptolaemus, montrouzieri, is, known, as, the, mealybug, destroyer, because, both, adults, and, larvae, feed, on, mealybugs, and, some, soft, scales, ants, looking, after, their, providers, of, honeydew, tend, to, drive, off, predators, but, the, mealybug, destroyer, has, outwitted, the, ants, by, developing, cryptic, camouflage, with, their, larvae, mimicking, scale, larvae, many, scale, species, are, serious, crop, pests, and, are, particularly, problematic, for, their, ability, to, evade, quarantine, measures, in, 1990, they, caused, around, 5, billion, of, damage, to, crops, in, the, united, states, the, waxy, covering, of, many, species, of, scale, protects, their, adults, effectively, from, contact, insecticides, which, are, only, effective, against, the, first, instar, nymph, stage, known, as, the, crawler, however, scales, can, often, be, controlled, using, horticultural, oils, that, suffocate, them, systemic, pesticides, that, poison, the, sap, of, the, host, plants, or, by, biological, control, agents, such, as, tiny, parasitoid, wasps, and, ladybirds, insecticidal, soap, may, also, be, used, against, scales, one, species, the, cottony, cushion, scale, is, a, serious, commercial, pest, on, 65, families, of, woody, plants, including, citrus, fruits, it, has, spread, worldwide, from, australia, at, the, same, time, some, kinds, of, scale, insects, are, themselves, useful, as, biological, control, agents, for, pest, plants, such, as, various, species, of, cochineal, insects, that, attack, invasive, species, of, prickly, pear, which, spread, widely, especially, in, australia, and, africa, some, types, of, scale, insect, are, economically, valuable, for, the, substances, they, can, yield, under, proper, husbandry, some, such, as, the, cochineal, kermes, lac, armenian, cochineal, and, polish, cochineal, have, been, used, to, produce, red, dyes, for, coloring, foods, and, dyeing, fabrics, both, the, colour, name, crimson, and, the, generic, name, kermes, are, from, italian, carmesi, or, cremesi, for, the, dye, used, for, italian, silk, textiles, in, turn, from, the, persian, qirmiz, meaning, both, the, colour, and, the, insect, the, colour, name, scarlet, is, similarly, derived, from, arabic, sikl, t, denoting, extremely, expensive, luxury, silks, dyed, red, using, kermes, some, waxy, scale, species, in, the, genera, ceroplastes, and, ericerus, produce, materials, such, as, chinese, wax, and, several, genera, of, lac, scales, produce, shellac, the, containing, group, of, the, scale, insects, was, formerly, treated, as, the, superfamily, coccoidea, but, taxonomic, uncertainties, have, led, workers, to, prefer, the, use, of, the, infraorder, coccomorpha, as, the, preferred, name, for, the, group, scale, insects, are, members, of, the, sternorrhyncha, the, phylogeny, of, the, extant, groups, inferred, from, analysis, of, small, subunit, 18s, ribosomal, rna, is, shown, in, the, first, cladogram, psylloidea, jumping, plant, lice, etc, aleyrodoidea, whiteflies, coccomorpha, scale, insects, phylloxeroidea, phylloxera, bugs, aphididae, aphids, phylogenetic, diversification, within, the, coccomorpha, has, been, analysed, by, the, taxonomist, isabelle, vea, and, the, entomologist, david, grimaldi, in, 2016, combining, dna, 3, gene, regions, and, 174, morphological, characters, to, allow, fossil, evidence, to, be, incorporated, they, showed, that, the, main, scale, insect, lineages, diverged, before, their, angiosperm, hosts, and, suggested, that, the, insects, switched, from, feeding, on, gymnosperms, once, the, angiosperms, became, common, and, widespread, in, the, cretaceous, the, coccomorpha, appeared, at, the, start, of, the, triassic, period, some, 245, mya, the,
