notably, in, the, temporary, body, art, of, mehndi, or, henna, tattoo, resulting, from, the, staining, of, the, skin, using, dyes, from, the, henna, plant, after, henna, stains, reach, their, peak, colour, they, hold, for, a, few, days, then, gradually, wear, off, by, way, of, exfoliation, typically, within, one, to, three, weeks, henna, has, been, used, in, ancient, egypt, ancient, near, east, and, then, the, indian, subcontinent, to, dye, skin, hair, and, fingernails, as, well, as, fabrics, including, silk, wool, and, leather, historically, henna, was, used, in, west, asia, including, the, arabian, peninsula, and, in, carthage, other, parts, of, north, africa, west, africa, central, africa, the, horn, of, africa, and, the, indian, subcontinent, the, name, henna, is, used, in, other, skin, and, hair, dyes, such, as, black, henna, and, neutral, henna, neither, of, which, is, derived, from, the, henna, plant, the, word, henna, comes, from, the, arabic, ala, lc, inn, pronounced, the, origins, of, the, initial, human, uses, of, henna, are, uncertain, however, there, are, records, that, the, plant, was, marketed, in, babylonia, and, was, used, in, ancient, egypt, on, some, mummies, to, dye, their, hair, skin, nails, or, funeral, wrappings, it, arrived, in, north, africa, during, the, punic, civilization, through, phoenician, diasporas, where, it, was, used, as, a, beautification, tool, pliny, the, elder, wrote, about, its, use, in, the, roman, empire, as, a, medicine, a, perfume, and, a, dye, whole, unbroken, henna, leaves, will, not, stain, the, skin, because, the, active, chemical, agent, lawsone, is, bound, within, the, plant, however, dried, henna, leaves, will, stain, the, skin, if, they, are, mashed, into, a, paste, the, lawsone, will, gradually, migrate, from, the, henna, paste, into, the, outer, layer, of, the, skin, and, bind, to, the, proteins, in, it, creating, a, stain, since, it, is, difficult, to, form, intricate, patterns, from, coarsely, crushed, leaves, henna, is, commonly, traded, as, a, powder, made, by, drying, milling, and, sifting, the, leaves, the, dry, powder, is, mixed, with, one, of, a, number, of, liquids, including, water, lemon, juice, strong, tea, and, other, ingredients, depending, on, the, tradition, many, artists, use, sugar, or, molasses, in, the, paste, to, improve, consistency, to, keep, it, stuck, to, the, skin, better, the, henna, mix, must, rest, between, one, and, 48, hours, before, use, in, order, to, release, the, lawsone, from, the, leaf, matter, the, timing, depends, on, the, crop, of, henna, being, used, essential, oils, with, high, levels, of, monoterpene, alcohols, such, as, tea, tree, cajuput, or, lavender, will, improve, skin, stain, characteristics, other, essential, oils, such, as, eucalyptus, and, clove, are, not, used, because, they, are, too, irritating, to, the, skin, the, paste, can, be, applied, with, many, traditional, and, innovative, tools, starting, with, a, basic, stick, or, twig, in, morocco, a, syringe, is, common, a, plastic, cone, similar, to, those, used, to, pipe, icing, onto, cakes, is, used, in, india, a, light, stain, may, be, achieved, within, minutes, but, the, longer, the, paste, is, left, on, the, skin, the, darker, and, longer, lasting, the, stain, will, be, so, it, needs, to, be, left, on, as, long, as, possible, to, prevent, it, from, drying, or, falling, off, the, skin, the, paste, is, often, sealed, down, by, dabbing, a, sugar, lemon, mix, over, the, dried, paste, or, adding, some, form, of, sugar, to, the, paste, after, some, time, the, dry, paste, is, simply, brushed, or, scraped, away, the, paste, should, be, kept, on, the, skin, for, a, minimum, of, four, to, six, hours, but, longer, times, and, even, wearing, the, paste, overnight, is, a, common, practice, removal, should, not, be, done, with, water, as, water, interferes, with, the, oxidation, process, of, stain, development, cooking, oil, may, be, used, to, loosen, dry, paste, henna, stains, are, orange, when, the, paste, is, first, removed, but, darken, over, the, following, three, days, to, a, deep, reddish, brown, due, to, oxidation, soles, and, palms, have, the, thickest, layer, of, skin, and, so, take, up, the, most, lawsone, and, take, it, to, the, greatest, depth, so, that, hands, and, feet, will, have, the, darkest, and, most, long, lasting, stains, some, also, believe, that, steaming, or, warming, the, henna, pattern, will, darken, the, stain, either, during, the, time, the, paste, is, still, on, the, skin, or, after, the, paste, has, been, removed, it, is, debatable, whether, this, adds, to, the, color, of, the, result, as, well, after, the, stain, reaches, its, peak, color, it, holds, for, a, few, days, then, gradually, wears, off, by, way, of, exfoliation, typically, within, one, to, three, weeks, natural, henna, pastes, containing, only, henna, powder, a, liquid, water, lemon, juice, etc, and, an, essential, oil, lavender, cajuput, tea, tree, etc, are, not, shelf, stable, meaning, they, expire, quickly, and, cannot, be, left, out, on, a, shelf, for, over, one, week, without, losing, their, ability, to, stain, the, skin, the, leaf, of, the, henna, plant, contains, a, finite, amount, of, lawsone, as, a, result, once, the, powder, has, been, mixed, into, a, paste, this, leaching, of, dye, molecule, into, the, mixture, will, only, occur, for, an, average, of, two, to, six, days, if, a, paste, will, not, be, used, within, the, first, few, days, after, mixing, it, can, be, frozen, for, up, to, four, months, to, halt, the, dye, release, for, thawing, and, use, at, a, later, time, commercially, packaged, pastes, that, remain, able, to, stain, the, skin, longer, than, seven, days, without, refrigeration, or, freezing, contain, other, chemicals, besides, henna, that, may, be, dangerous, to, the, skin, after, the, initial, seven, day, release, of, lawsone, dye, the, henna, leaf, is, spent, therefore, any, dye, created, by, these, commercial, cones, on, the, skin, after, this, time, period, is, actually, the, result, of, other, compounds, in, the, product, these, chemicals, are, often, undisclosed, on, packaging, and, have, a, wide, range, of, colors, including, what, appears, to, be, a, natural, looking, color, stain, produced, by, dyes, such, as, sodium, picramate, these, products, often, do, not, contain, any, henna, there, are, many, adulterated, henna, pastes, such, as, these, and, others, for, sale, today, that, are, erroneously, marketed, as, natural, pure, or, organic, all, containing, potentially, dangerous, undisclosed, additives, the, length, of, time, a, pre, manufactured, paste, takes, to, arrive, in, the, hands, of, consumers, is, typically, longer, than, the, seven, day, dye, release, window, of, henna, therefore, one, can, reasonably, expect, that, any, pre, made, mass, produced, cone, that, is, not, shipped, frozen, is, a, potentially, harmful, adulterated, chemical, variety, henna, only, stains, the, skin, one, color, a, variation, of, reddish, brown, at, full, maturity, three, days, after, application, powdered, fresh, henna, unlike, pre, mixed, paste, can, be, easily, shipped, all, over, the, world, and, stored, for, many, years, in, a, well, sealed, package, body, art, quality, henna, is, often, more, finely, sifted,
