the, endocrine, system, is, a, messenger, system, in, an, organism, comprising, feedback, loops, of, hormones, that, are, released, by, internal, glands, directly, into, the, circulatory, system, and, that, target, and, regulate, distant, organs, in, vertebrates, the, hypothalamus, is, the, neural, control, center, for, all, endocrine, systems, in, humans, the, major, endocrine, glands, are, the, thyroid, parathyroid, pituitary, pineal, and, adrenal, glands, and, the, male, testis, and, female, ovaries, the, hypothalamus, pancreas, and, thymus, also, function, as, endocrine, glands, among, other, functions, the, hypothalamus, and, pituitary, glands, are, organs, of, the, neuroendocrine, system, one, of, the, most, important, functions, of, the, hypothalamus, it, is, located, in, the, brain, adjacent, to, the, pituitary, gland, is, to, link, the, endocrine, system, to, the, nervous, system, via, the, pituitary, gland, other, organs, such, as, the, kidneys, also, have, roles, within, the, endocrine, system, by, secreting, certain, hormones, the, study, of, the, endocrine, system, and, its, disorders, is, known, as, endocrinology, the, thyroid, secretes, thyroxine, the, pituitary, secretes, growth, hormone, the, pineal, secretes, melatonin, the, testis, secretes, testosterone, and, the, ovaries, secretes, estrogen, and, progesterone, glands, that, signal, each, other, in, sequence, are, often, referred, to, as, an, axis, such, as, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, in, addition, to, the, specialized, endocrine, organs, mentioned, above, many, other, organs, that, are, part, of, other, body, systems, have, secondary, endocrine, functions, including, bone, kidneys, liver, heart, and, gonads, for, example, the, kidney, secretes, the, endocrine, hormone, erythropoietin, hormones, can, be, amino, acid, complexes, steroids, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, or, prostaglandins, the, endocrine, system, is, contrasted, both, to, exocrine, glands, which, secrete, hormones, to, the, outside, of, the, body, and, to, the, system, known, as, paracrine, signalling, between, cells, over, a, relatively, short, distance, endocrine, glands, have, no, ducts, are, vascular, and, commonly, have, intracellular, vacuoles, or, granules, that, store, their, hormones, in, contrast, exocrine, glands, such, as, salivary, glands, mammary, glands, and, submucosal, glands, within, the, gastrointestinal, tract, tend, to, be, much, less, vascular, and, have, ducts, or, a, hollow, lumen, endocrinology, is, a, branch, of, internal, medicine, the, human, endocrine, system, consists, of, several, systems, that, operate, via, feedback, loops, several, important, feedback, systems, are, mediated, via, the, hypothalamus, and, pituitary, endocrine, glands, are, glands, of, the, endocrine, system, that, secrete, their, products, hormones, directly, into, interstitial, spaces, where, they, are, absorbed, into, blood, rather, than, through, a, duct, the, major, glands, of, the, endocrine, system, include, the, pineal, gland, pituitary, gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid, gland, parathyroid, gland, hypothalamus, and, adrenal, glands, the, hypothalamus, and, pituitary, gland, are, neuroendocrine, organs, the, hypothalamus, and, the, anterior, pituitary, are, two, out, of, the, three, endocrine, glands, that, are, important, in, cell, signaling, they, are, both, part, of, the, hpa, axis, which, is, known, to, play, a, role, in, cell, signaling, in, the, nervous, system, hypothalamus, the, hypothalamus, is, a, key, regulator, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, the, endocrine, system, has, three, sets, of, endocrine, outputs, which, include, the, magnocellular, system, the, parvocellular, system, and, autonomic, intervention, the, magnocellular, is, involved, in, the, expression, of, oxytocin, or, vasopressin, the, parvocellular, is, involved, in, controlling, the, secretion, of, hormones, from, the, anterior, pituitary, anterior, pituitary, the, main, role, of, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, is, to, produce, and, secrete, tropic, hormones, some, examples, of, tropic, hormones, secreted, by, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, include, tsh, acth, gh, lh, and, fsh, there, are, many, types, of, cells, that, make, up, the, endocrine, system, and, these, cells, typically, make, up, larger, tissues, and, organs, that, function, within, and, outside, of, the, endocrine, system, the, fetal, endocrine, system, is, one, of, the, first, systems, to, develop, during, prenatal, development, the, fetal, adrenal, cortex, can, be, identified, within, four, weeks, of, gestation, the, adrenal, cortex, originates, from, the, thickening, of, the, intermediate, mesoderm, at, five, to, six, weeks, of, gestation, the, mesonephros, differentiates, into, a, tissue, known, as, the, genital, ridge, the, genital, ridge, produces, the, steroidogenic, cells, for, both, the, gonads, and, the, adrenal, cortex, the, adrenal, medulla, is, derived, from, ectodermal, cells, cells, that, will, become, adrenal, tissue, move, retroperitoneally, to, the, upper, portion, of, the, mesonephros, at, seven, weeks, of, gestation, the, adrenal, cells, are, joined, by, sympathetic, cells, that, originate, from, the, neural, crest, to, form, the, adrenal, medulla, at, the, end, of, the, eighth, week, the, adrenal, glands, have, been, encapsulated, and, have, formed, a, distinct, organ, above, the, developing, kidneys, at, birth, the, adrenal, glands, weigh, approximately, eight, to, nine, grams, twice, that, of, the, adult, adrenal, glands, and, are, 0, 5, of, the, total, body, weight, at, 25, weeks, the, adult, adrenal, cortex, zone, develops, and, is, responsible, for, the, primary, synthesis, of, steroids, during, the, early, postnatal, weeks, the, thyroid, gland, develops, from, two, different, clusterings, of, embryonic, cells, one, part, is, from, the, thickening, of, the, pharyngeal, floor, which, serves, as, the, precursor, of, the, thyroxine, t, 4, producing, follicular, cells, the, other, part, is, from, the, caudal, extensions, of, the, fourth, pharyngobranchial, pouches, which, results, in, the, parafollicular, calcitonin, secreting, cells, these, two, structures, are, apparent, by, 16, to, 17, days, of, gestation, around, the, 24th, day, of, gestation, the, foramen, cecum, a, thin, flask, like, diverticulum, of, the, median, anlage, develops, at, approximately, 24, to, 32, days, of, gestation, the, median, anlage, develops, into, a, bilobed, structure, by, 50, days, of, gestation, the, medial, and, lateral, anlage, have, fused, together, at, 12, weeks, of, gestation, the, fetal, thyroid, is, capable, of, storing, iodine, for, the, production, of, trh, tsh, and, free, thyroid, hormone, at, 20, weeks, the, fetus, is, able, to, implement, feedback, mechanisms, for, the, production, of, thyroid, hormones, during, fetal, development, t, 4, is, the, major, thyroid, hormone, being, produced, while, triiodothyronine, t, 3, and, its, inactive, derivative, reverse, t, 3, are, not, detected, until, the, third, trimester, a, lateral, and, ventral, view, of, an, embryo, showing, the, third, inferior, and, fourth, superior, parathyroid, glands, during, the, 6th, week, of, embryogenesis, once, the, embryo, reaches, four, weeks, of, gestation, the, parathyroid, glands, begins, to, develop, the, human, embryo, forms, five, sets, of, endoderm, lined, pharyngeal, pouches, the, third, and, fourth, pouch, are, responsible, for, developing, into, the, inferior, and, superior, parathyroid, glands, respectively, the, third, pharyngeal, pouch, encounters, the, developing, thyroid, gland, and, they, migrate, down, to, the, lower, poles, of, the, thyroid, lobes, the, fourth, pharyngeal, pouch, later, encounters, the, developing, thyroid, gland, and, migrates, to, the, upper, poles, of, the, thyroid, lobes, at, 14, weeks, of, gestation, the, parathyroid, glands, begin, to, enlarge, from, 0, 1, mm, in, diameter, to, approximately, 1, 2, mm, at, birth, the, developing, parathyroid, glands, are, physiologically, functional, beginning, in, the, second, trimester, studies, in, mice, have, shown, that, interfering, with, the, hox15, gene, can, cause, parathyroid, gland, aplasia, which, suggests, the, gene, plays, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, the, parathyroid, gland, the, genes, tbx1, crkl, gata3, gcm2, and, sox3, have, also, been, shown, to, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, formation, of, the, parathyroid, gland, mutations, in, tbx1, and, crkl, genes, are, correlated, with, digeorge, syndrome, while, mutations, in, gata3, have, also, resulted, in, a, digeorge, like, syndrome, malformations, in, the, gcm2, gene, have, resulted, in, hypoparathyroidism, studies, on, sox3, gene, mutations, have, demonstrated, that, it, plays, a, role, in, parathyroid, development, these, mutations, also, lead, to, varying, degrees, of, hypopituitarism, the, human, fetal, pancreas, begins, to, develop, by, the, fourth, week, of, gestation, five, weeks, later, the, pancreatic, alpha, and, beta, cells, have, begun, to, emerge, reaching, eight, to, ten, weeks, into, development, the, pancreas, starts, producing, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and, pancreatic, polypeptide, during, the, early, stages, of, fetal, development, the, number, of, pancreatic, alpha, cells, outnumbers, the, number, of, pancreatic, beta, cells, the, alpha, cells, reach, their, peak, in, the, middle, stage, of, gestation, from, the, middle, stage, until, term, the, beta, cells, continue, to, increase, in, number, until, they, reach, an, approximate, 1, 1, ratio, with, the, alpha, cells, the, insulin, concentration, within, the, fetal, pancreas, is, 3, 6, pmol, g, at, seven, to, ten, weeks, which, rises, to, 30, pmol, g, at, 16, 25, weeks, of, gestation, near, term, the, insulin, concentration, increases, to, 93, pmol, g, the, endocrine, cells, have, dispersed, throughout, the, body, within, 10, weeks, at, 31, weeks, of, development, the, islets, of, langerhans, have, differentiated, while, the, fetal, pancreas, has, functional, beta, cells, by, 14, to, 24, weeks, of, gestation, the, amount, of, insulin, that, is, released, into, the, bloodstream, is, relatively, low, in, a, study, of, pregnant, women, carrying, fetuses, in, the, mid, gestation, and, near, term, stages, of, development, the, fetuses, did, not, have, an, increase, in, plasma, insulin, levels, in, response, to, injections, of, high, levels, of, glucose, in, contrast, to, insulin, the, fetal, plasma, glucagon, levels, are, relatively, high, and, continue, to, increase, during, development, at, the, mid, stage, of, gestation, the, glucagon, concentration, is, 6, g, g, compared, to, 2, g, g, in, adult, humans, just, like, insulin, fetal, glucagon, plasma, levels, do, not, change, in, response, to, an, infusion, of, glucose, however, a, study, of, an, infusion, of, alanine, into, pregnant, women, was, shown, to, increase, the, cord, blood, and, maternal, glucagon, concentrations, demonstrating, a, fetal, response, to, amino, acid, exposure, as, such, while, the, fetal, pancreatic, alpha, and, beta, islet, cells, have, fully, developed, and, are, capable, of, hormone, synthesis, during, the, remaining, fetal, maturation, the, islet, cells, are, relatively, immature, in, their, capacity, to, produce, glucagon, and, insulin, this, is, thought, to, be, a, result, of, the, relatively, stable, levels, of, fetal, serum, glucose, concentrations, achieved, via, maternal, transfer, of, glucose, through, the, placenta, on, the, other, hand, the, stable, fetal, serum, glucose, levels, could, be, attributed, to, the, absence, of, pancreatic, signaling, initiated, by, incretins, during, feeding, in, addition, the, fetal, pancreatic, islets, cells, are, unable, to, sufficiently, produce, camp, and, rapidly, degrade, camp, by, phosphodiesterase, necessary, to, secrete, glucagon, and, insulin, during, fetal, development, the, storage, of, glycogen, is, controlled, by, fetal, glucocorticoids, and, placental, lactogen, fetal, insulin, is, responsible, for, increasing, glucose, uptake, and, lipogenesis, during, the, stages, leading, up, to, birth, fetal, cells, contain, a, higher, amount, of, insulin, receptors, in, comparison, to, adults, cells, and, fetal, insulin, receptors, are, not, downregulated, in, cases, of, hyperinsulinemia, in, comparison, fetal, haptic, glucagon, receptors, are, lowered, in, comparison, to, adult, cells, and, the, glycemic, effect, of, glucagon, is, blunted, this, temporary, physiological, change, aids, the, increased, rate, of, fetal, development, during, the, final, trimester, poorly, managed, maternal, diabetes, mellitus, is, linked, to, fetal, macrosomia, increased, risk, of, miscarriage, and, defects, in, fetal, development, maternal, hyperglycemia, is, also, linked, to, increased, insulin, levels, and, beta, cell, hyperplasia, in, the, post, term, infant, children, of, diabetic, mothers, are, at, an, increased, risk, for, conditions, such, as, polycythemia, renal, vein, thrombosis, hypocalcemia, respiratory, distress, syndrome, jaundice, cardiomyopathy, congenital, heart, disease, and, improper, organ, development, the, reproductive, system, begins, development, at, four, to, five, weeks, of, gestation, with, germ, cell, migration, the, bipotential, gonad, results, from, the, collection, of, the, medioventral, region, of, the, urogenital, ridge, at, the, five, week, point, the, developing, gonads, break, away, from, the, adrenal, primordium, gonadal, differentiation, begins, 42, days, following, conception, for, males, the, testes, form, at, six, fetal, weeks, and, the, sertoli, cells, begin, developing, by, the, eight, week, of, gestation, sry, the, sex, determining, locus, serves, to, differentiate, the, sertoli, cells, the, sertoli, cells, are, the, point, of, origin, for, anti, m, llerian, hormone, once, synthesized, the, anti, m, llerian, hormone, initiates, the, ipsilateral, regression, of, the, m, llerian, tract, and, inhibits, the, development, of, female, internal, features, at, 10, weeks, of, gestation, the, leydig, cells, begin, to, produce, androgen, hormones, the, androgen, hormone, dihydrotestosterone, is, responsible, for, the, development, of, the, male, external, genitalia, the, testicles, descend, during, prenatal, development, in, a, two, stage, process, that, begins, at, eight, weeks, of, gestation, and, continues, through, the, middle, of, the, third, trimester, during, the, transabdominal, stage, 8, to, 15, weeks, of, gestation, the, gubernacular, ligament, contracts, and, begins, to, thicken, the, craniosuspensory, ligament, begins, to, break, down, this, stage, is, regulated, by, the, secretion, of, insulin, like, 3, insl3, a, relaxin, like, factor, produced, by, the, testicles, and, the, insl3, g, coupled, receptor, lgr8, during, the, transinguinal, phase, 25, to, 35, weeks, of, gestation, the, testicles, descend, into, the, scrotum, this, stage, is, regulated, by, androgens, the, genitofemoral, nerve, and, calcitonin, gene, related, peptide, during, the, second, and, third, trimester, testicular, development, concludes, with, the, diminution, of, the, fetal, leydig, cells, and, the, lengthening, and, coiling, of, the, seminiferous, cords, for, females, the, ovaries, become, morphologically, visible, by, the, 8th, week, of, gestation, the, absence, of, testosterone, results, in, the, diminution, of, the, wolffian, structures, the, m, llerian, structures, remain, and, develop, into, the, fallopian, tubes, uterus, and, the, upper, region, of, the, vagina, the, urogenital, sinus, develops, into, the, urethra, and, lower, region, of, the, vagina, the, genital, tubercle, develops, into, the, clitoris, the, urogenital,

can, begin, studies, of, gene, expression, show, that, a, specific, complement, of, genes, such, as, follistatin, and, multiple, cyclin, kinase, inhibitors, are, involved, in, ovarian, development, an, assortment, of, genes, and, proteins, such, as, wnt4, rspo1, foxl2, and, various, estrogen, receptors, have, been, shown, to, prevent, the, development, of, testicles, or, the, lineage, of, male, type, cells, the, pituitary, gland, is, formed, within, the, rostral, neural, plate, the, rathke, s, pouch, a, cavity, of, ectodermal, cells, of, the, oropharynx, forms, between, the, fourth, and, fifth, week, of, gestation, and, upon, full, development, it, gives, rise, to, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, by, seven, weeks, of, gestation, the, anterior, pituitary, vascular, system, begins, to, develop, during, the, first, 12, weeks, of, gestation, the, anterior, pituitary, undergoes, cellular, differentiation, at, 20, weeks, of, gestation, the, hypophyseal, portal, system, has, developed, the, rathke, s, pouch, grows, towards, the, third, ventricle, and, fuses, with, the, diverticulum, this, eliminates, the, lumen, and, the, structure, becomes, rathke, s, cleft, the, posterior, pituitary, lobe, is, formed, from, the, diverticulum, portions, of, the, pituitary, tissue, may, remain, in, the, nasopharyngeal, midline, in, rare, cases, this, results, in, functioning, ectopic, hormone, secreting, tumors, in, the, nasopharynx, the, functional, development, of, the, anterior, pituitary, involves, spatiotemporal, regulation, of, transcription, factors, expressed, in,

somatotroph, cells, begin, to, develop, with, cytoplasmic, expression, of, human, growth, hormone, once, a, fetus, reaches, 12, weeks, of, development, the, thyrotrophs, begin, expression, of, beta, subunits, for, tsh, while, gonadotrophs, being, to, express, beta, subunits, for, lh, and, fsh, male, fetuses, predominately, produced, lh, expressing, gonadotrophs, while, female, fetuses, produce, an, equal, expression, of, lh, and, fsh, expressing, gonadotrophs, at, 24, weeks, of, gestation, prolactin, expressing, lactotrophs, begin, to, emerge, a, hormone, is, any, of, a, class, of, signaling, molecules, produced, by, cells, in, glands, in, multicellular, organisms, that, are, transported, by, the, circulatory, system, to, target, distant, organs, to, regulate, physiology, and, behaviour, hormones, have, diverse, chemical, structures, mainly, of, 3, classes, eicosanoids, steroids, and, amino, acid, protein, derivatives, amines, peptides, and, proteins, the, glands, that, secrete, hormones, comprise, the, endocrine, system, the, term, hormone, is, sometimes, extended, to, include, chemicals, produced, by, cells, that, affect, the, same, cell, autocrine, or, intracrine, signalling, or, nearby, cells, paracrine, signalling, hormones, are, used, to, communicate, between, organs, and, tissues, for, physiological, regulation, and, behavioral, activities, such, as, digestion, metabolism, respiration, tissue, function, sensory, perception, sleep, excretion, lactation, stress, growth, and, development, movement, reproduction, and, mood, hormones, affect, distant, cells, by, binding, to, specific, receptor, proteins, in, the, target, cell, resulting, in, a, change, in, cell, function, this, may, lead, to, cell, type, specific, responses, that, include, rapid, changes, to, the, activity, of, existing, proteins, or, slower, changes, in, the, expression, of, target, genes, amino, acid, based, hormones, amines, and, peptide, or, protein, hormones, are, water, soluble, and, act, on, the, surface, of, target, cells, via, signal, transduction, pathways, steroid, hormones, being, lipid, soluble, move, through, the, plasma, membranes, of, target, cells, to, act, within, their, nuclei, the, typical, mode, of, cell, signalling, in, the, endocrine, system, is, endocrine, signaling, that, is, using, the, circulatory, system, to, reach, distant, target, organs, however, there, are, also, other, modes, i, e, paracrine, autocrine, and, neuroendocrine, signaling, purely, neurocrine, signaling, between, neurons, on, the, other, hand, belongs, completely, to, the, nervous, system, autocrine, signaling, is, a, form, of, signaling, in, which, a, cell, secretes, a, hormone, or, chemical, messenger, called, the, autocrine, agent, that, binds, to, autocrine, receptors, on, the, same, cell, leading, to, changes, in, the, cells, some, endocrinologists, and, clinicians, include, the, paracrine, system, as, part, of, the, endocrine, system, but, there, is, not, consensus, paracrines, are, slower, acting, targeting, cells, in, the, same, tissue, or, organ, an, example, of, this, is, somatostatin, which, is, released, by, some, pancreatic, cells, and, targets, other, pancreatic, cells, juxtacrine, signaling, is, a, type, of, intercellular, communication, that, is, transmitted, via, oligosaccharide, lipid, or, protein, components, of, a, cell, membrane, and, may, affect, either, the, emitting, cell, or, the, immediately, adjacent, cells, it, occurs, between, adjacent, cells, that, possess, broad, patches, of, closely, opposed, plasma, membrane, linked, by, transmembrane, channels, known, as, connexons, the, gap, between, the, cells, can, usually, be, between, only, 2, and, 4, nm, diseases, of, the, endocrine, system, are, common, including, conditions, such, as, diabetes, mellitus, thyroid, disease, and, obesity, endocrine, disease, is, characterized, by, misregulated, hormone, release, a, productive, pituitary, adenoma, inappropriate, response, to, signaling, hypothyroidism, lack, of, a, gland, diabetes, mellitus, type, 1, diminished, erythropoiesis, in, chronic, kidney, failure, or, structural, enlargement, in, a, critical, site, such, as, the, thyroid, toxic, multinodular, goitre, hypofunction, of, endocrine, glands, can, occur, as, a, result, of, loss, of, reserve, hyposecretion, agenesis, atrophy, or, active, destruction, hyperfunction, can, occur, as, a, result, of, hypersecretion, loss, of, suppression, hyperplastic, or, neoplastic, change, or, hyperstimulation, endocrinopathies, are, classified, as, primary, secondary, or, tertiary, primary, endocrine, disease, inhibits, the, action, of, downstream, glands, secondary, endocrine, disease, is, indicative, of, a, problem, with, the, pituitary, gland, tertiary, endocrine, disease, is, associated, with, dysfunction, of, the, hypothalamus, and, its, releasing, hormones, as, the, thyroid, and, hormones, have, been, implicated, in, signaling, distant, tissues, to, proliferate, for, example, the, estrogen, receptor, has, been, shown, to, be, involved, in, certain, breast, cancers, endocrine, paracrine, and, autocrine, signaling, have, all, been, implicated, in, proliferation, one, of, the, required, steps, of, oncogenesis, other, common, diseases, that, result, from, endocrine, dysfunction, include, addison, s, disease, cushing, s, disease, and, graves, disease, cushing, s, disease, and, addison, s, disease, are, pathologies, involving, the, dysfunction, of, the, adrenal, gland, dysfunction, in, the, adrenal, gland, could, be, due, to, primary, or, secondary, factors, and, can, result, in, hypercortisolism, or, hypocortisolism, cushing, s, disease, is, characterized, by, the, hypersecretion, of, the, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, acth, due, to, a, pituitary, adenoma, that, ultimately, causes, endogenous, hypercortisolism, by, stimulating, the, adrenal, glands, some, clinical, signs, of, cushing, s, disease, include, obesity, moon, face, and, hirsutism, addison, s, disease, is, an, endocrine, disease, that, results, from, hypocortisolism, caused, by, adrenal, gland, insufficiency, adrenal, insufficiency, is, significant, because, it, is, correlated, with, decreased, ability, to, maintain, blood, pressure, and, blood, sugar, a, defect, that, can, prove, to, be, fatal, graves, disease, involves, the, hyperactivity, of, the, thyroid, gland, which, produces, the, t3, and, t4, hormones, graves, disease, effects, range, from, excess, sweating, fatigue, heat, intolerance, and, high, blood, pressure, to, swelling, of, the, eyes, that, causes, redness, puffiness, and, in, rare, cases, reduced, or, double, vision, a, neuroendocrine, system, has, been, observed, in, all, animals, with, a, nervous, system, and, all, vertebrates, have, a, hypothalamus, pituitary, axis, all, vertebrates, have, a, thyroid, which, in, amphibians, is, also, crucial, for, transformation, of, larvae, into, adult, form, all, vertebrates, have, adrenal, gland, tissue, with, mammals, unique, in, having, it, organized, into, layers, all, vertebrates, have, some, form, of, a, renin, angiotensin, axis, and, all, tetrapods, have, aldosterone, as, a, primary, mineralocorticoid
