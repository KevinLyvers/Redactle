dicotylidae, peccaries, also, javelinas, or, skunk, pigs, are, pig, like, ungulates, of, the, family, tayassuidae, new, world, pigs, they, are, found, throughout, central, and, south, america, trinidad, in, the, caribbean, and, in, the, southwestern, area, of, north, america, peccaries, usually, measure, between, 90, and, 130, cm, 2, ft, 11, in, and, 4, ft, 3, in, in, length, and, a, full, grown, adult, usually, weighs, about, 20, to, 40, kg, 44, to, 88, lb, they, represent, the, closest, relatives, of, the, family, suidae, which, contains, pigs, and, relatives, together, tayassuidae, and, suidae, are, grouped, in, the, suborder, suina, within, the, order, artiodactyla, even, toed, ungulates, peccaries, are, social, creatures, that, live, in, herds, they, are, omnivores, and, eat, roots, grubs, and, a, variety, of, other, foods, they, can, identify, each, other, by, their, strong, odors, a, group, of, peccaries, that, travel, and, live, together, is, called, a, squadron, a, squadron, of, peccaries, averages, between, six, and, nine, members, peccaries, first, appeared, in, north, america, during, the, miocene, and, migrated, into, south, america, during, the, pliocene, pleistocene, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, they, are, often, confused, with, feral, domestic, pigs, commonly, known, as, razorback, hogs, in, many, parts, of, the, united, states, when, the, two, occur, in, the, wild, in, similar, ranges, the, maya, kept, herds, of, peccaries, using, them, in, rituals, and, for, food, they, are, kept, as, pets, in, many, countries, in, addition, to, being, raised, on, farms, as, a, source, of, food, the, word, peccary, is, derived, from, the, carib, word, pakira, or, paquira, in, portuguese, a, peccary, is, called, pecari, porco, do, mato, queixada, taja, u, among, other, names, like, cateto, or, caititu, in, spanish, it, is, called, javelina, jabal, a, word, also, used, to, describe, wild, boar, sajino, or, pecar, the, word, javelina, derives, from, the, spanish, word, for, wild, boar, in, french, guiana, and, suriname, the, animal, is, called, pakira, the, scientific, name, tayassuidae, derives, from, the, same, source, as, the, portuguese, taja, u, a, peccary, is, a, medium, sized, animal, with, a, strong, resemblance, to, a, pig, like, a, pig, it, has, a, snout, ending, in, a, cartilaginous, disc, and, eyes, that, are, small, relative, to, its, head, also, like, a, pig, it, uses, only, the, middle, two, digits, for, walking, although, unlike, pigs, the, other, toes, may, be, altogether, absent, its, stomach, is, not, ruminating, though, it, has, three, chambers, it, is, more, complex, than, those, of, pigs, peccaries, are, foregut, fermenters, pigs, are, hindgut, fermenters, this, foregut, fermentation, similar, to, but, separately, evolved, from, a, ruminant, is, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, peccaries, are, omnivores, and, will, eat, insects, grubs, and, occasionally, small, animals, although, their, preferred, foods, consist, of, roots, grasses, seeds, fruit, and, cacti, particularly, prickly, pear, pigs, and, peccaries, can, be, differentiated, by, a, number, of, characteristic, including, tails, and, ear, shape, the, ears, of, pigs, are, large, and, upright, and, often, pointed, while, the, ears, of, peccaries, are, small, and, rounded, pigs, also, have, tasseled, tails, but, peccaries, tails, are, small, and, discreet, the, most, noticeable, difference, between, pigs, and, peccaries, is, the, shape, of, the, canine, teeth, or, tusks, in, european, pigs, the, tusks, are, long, and, curve, around, on, themselves, whereas, in, peccaries, the, tusks, are, short, and, straight, and, interlock, with, each, other, prohibiting, side, to, side, movement, of, the, jaw, the, jaws, and, tusks, of, peccaries, are, adapted, for, crushing, hard, seeds, and, slicing, into, plant, roots, and, they, also, use, their, tusks, to, defend, against, predators, the, dental, formula, for, peccaries, is, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, by, rubbing, the, tusks, together, they, can, make, a, chattering, noise, that, warns, potential, predators, to, stay, away, peccaries, are, social, animals, often, forming, herds, over, 100, individuals, have, been, recorded, for, a, single, herd, of, white, lipped, peccaries, but, collared, and, chacoan, peccaries, usually, form, smaller, groups, such, social, behavior, seems, to, have, been, the, situation, in, extinct, peccaries, as, well, the, giant, peccary, pecari, maximus, of, brazil, appears, to, be, less, social, primarily, living, in, pairs, peccaries, rely, on, their, social, structure, to, defend, territory, protect, against, predators, regulate, temperature, and, interact, with, other, members, of, the, species, peccaries, have, scent, glands, below, each, eye, and, another, on, their, backs, though, these, are, believed, to, be, rudimentary, in, p, maximus, they, use, the, scent, to, mark, herd, territories, which, range, from, 30, to, 280, hectares, 75, to, 700, acres, they, also, mark, other, herd, members, with, these, scent, glands, by, rubbing, one, against, another, the, pungent, odor, allows, peccaries, to, recognize, other, members, of, their, herd, despite, their, myopic, vision, the, odor, is, strong, enough, to, be, detected, by, humans, which, earns, the, peccary, the, nickname, of, skunk, pig, three, possibly, four, living, species, of, peccaries, are, found, from, the, southwestern, united, states, through, central, america, and, into, south, america, and, trinidad, each, in, their, own, genus, the, collared, peccary, dicotyles, tajacu, or, musk, hog, referring, to, the, animal, s, scent, glands, occurs, from, the, southwestern, united, states, into, south, america, and, the, island, of, trinidad, the, coat, consists, of, wiry, peppered, black, gray, and, brown, hair, with, a, lighter, colored, collar, circling, the, shoulders, they, bear, young, year, round, but, most, often, between, november, and, march, with, the, average, litter, size, consisting, of, two, to, three, offspring, they, are, found, in, many, habitats, from, arid, scrublands, to, humid, tropical, rain, forests, the, collared, peccary, is, well, adapted, to, habitat, disturbed, by, humans, merely, requiring, sufficient, cover, they, can, be, found, in, cities, and, agricultural, land, throughout, their, range, notable, populations, exist, in, the, suburbs, of, phoenix, and, tucson, arizona, where, they, feed, on, ornamental, plants, and, other, cultivated, vegetation, there, are, also, urban, populations, as, far, north, as, sedona, arizona, where, they, have, been, known, to, fill, a, niche, similar, to, raccoons, and, other, urban, scavengers, in, arizona, they, are, often, called, by, their, spanish, name, javelinas, collared, peccaries, are, generally, found, in, bands, of, 8, to, 15, animals, of, various, ages, they, defend, themselves, if, they, feel, threatened, but, otherwise, tend, to, ignore, humans, a, second, species, the, white, lipped, peccary, tayassu, pecari, is, mainly, found, in, rainforests, of, central, and, south, america, but, also, known, from, a, wide, range, of, other, habitats, such, as, dry, forests, grasslands, mangrove, cerrado, and, dry, xerophytic, areas, the, two, main, threats, to, their, survival, are, deforestation, and, hunting, the, third, species, the, chacoan, peccary, catagonus, wagneri, it, is, found, in, the, dry, shrub, habitat, or, chaco, of, paraguay, bolivia, and, argentina, the, chacoan, peccary, has, the, distinction, of, having, been, first, described, based, on, fossils, and, was, originally, thought, to, be, an, extinct, species, in, 1975, the, animal, was, discovered, in, the, chaco, region, of, paraguay, the, species, was, well, known, to, the, native, people, a, fourth, as, yet, unconfirmed, species, the, giant, peccary, dicotyles, maximus, was, described, from, the, brazilian, amazon, and, north, bolivia, by, dutch, biologist, marc, van, roosmalen, though, relatively, recently, discovered, it, has, been, known, to, the, local, tupi, people, as, caitetu, munde, which, means, great, peccary, which, lives, in, pairs, thought, to, be, the, largest, extant, peccary, it, can, grow, to, 1, 2, m, 4, ft, in, length, its, pelage, is, completely, dark, gray, with, no, collars, whatsoever, unlike, other, peccaries, it, lives, in, pairs, or, with, one, or, two, offspring, however, the, scientific, evidence, for, considering, it, as, a, species, separate, from, the, collared, peccary, has, later, been, questioned, leading, the, iucn, to, treat, it, as, a, synonym, during, the, late, pleistocene, two, extinct, peccaries, mylohyus, and, platygonus, were, widespread, across, north, america, and, in, the, case, of, platygonus, south, america, but, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, around, 12, 000, years, ago, following, the, arrival, of, humans, in, addition, tayassuidae, have, a, well, attested, fossil, record, and, numerous, extinct, genera, are, known, although, some, taxa, from, the, old, world, like, the, european, miocene, taucanamo, have, been, suggested, to, be, members, of, tayussidae, their, assignation, to, the, group, is, equivocal, with, a, 2017, phylogenetic, analysis, recovering, taucanamo, outside, the, clade, containing, suids, and, peccaries, the, oldest, unambiguous, fossils, of, peccaries, are, from, the, early, miocene, of, north, america, with, the, north, american, eocene, oligocene, genus, perchoerus, also, often, considered, an, early, peccary, recovered, outside, the, clade, containing, peccaries, and, suids, although, common, in, south, america, today, peccaries, did, not, reach, there, until, about, three, million, years, ago, during, the, great, american, interchange, when, the, isthmus, of, panama, formed, connecting, north, america, and, south, america, at, that, time, many, north, american, animals, including, peccaries, llamas, and, tapirs, entered, south, america, while, some, south, american, species, such, as, the, ground, sloths, and, opossums, migrated, north, several, species, of, peccary, across, the, genera, platygonus, and, mylohyus, remained, in, north, america, until, their, extinction, following, the, colonization, of, the, continent, by, humans, via, beringia, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, today, 2, of, the, 3, species, are, relegated, to, the, neotropical, realm, but, the, collared, peccary, ranges, into, northern, mexico, and, the, southwestern, united, states, peccaries, bear, a, familial, resemblance, to, true, pigs, due, to, their, common, ancestry, and, are, in, the, same, suborder, as, swine, suina, they, have, been, present, in, south, america, since, prehistoric, times, the, earliest, scientific, description, of, peccaries, in, the, new, world, is, in, brazil, in, 1547, and, referred, to, them, as, wild, pigs, it, has, been, documented, that, peccaries, were, tamed, penned, and, raised, for, food, and, ritual, purposes, in, the, yucat, n, panama, the, southern, caribbean, and, colombia, at, the, time, of, the, conquest, archaeological, remains, of, peccaries, have, been, found, in, mesoamerica, from, the, preclassic, or, formative, period, up, until, immediately, before, spanish, contact, specifically, peccary, remains, have, been, found, at, early, formative, olmec, civilization, sites, the, peccary, is, not, readily, suitable, for, modern, captive, breeding, lacking, suitable, characteristics, for, intensive, or, semi, intensive, systems, peccaries, require, a, higher, age, before, they, are, able, to, give, birth, parturition, and, have, a, tendency, towards, infanticide, recently, established, brazilian, boar, populations, are, not, to, be, confused, with, long, established, populations, of, feral, domestic, pigs, which, have, existed, mainly, in, the, pantanal, for, more, than, 100, years, along, with, native, peccaries, the, demographic, dynamics, of, the, interaction, between, feral, pig, populations, and, those, of, the, two, native, species, of, peccaries, collared, peccary, and, white, lipped, peccary, is, obscure, and, is, still, being, studied, the, existence, of, feral, pigs, could, somewhat, ease, jaguar, predation, on, peccary, populations, as, jaguars, show, a, preference, for, hunting, pigs, when, they, are, available
