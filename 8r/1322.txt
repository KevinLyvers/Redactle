organ, transplantation, is, a, medical, procedure, in, which, an, organ, is, removed, from, one, body, and, placed, in, the, body, of, a, recipient, to, replace, a, damaged, or, missing, organ, the, donor, and, recipient, may, be, at, the, same, location, or, organs, may, be, transported, from, a, donor, site, to, another, location, organs, and, or, tissues, that, are, transplanted, within, the, same, person, s, body, are, called, autografts, transplants, that, are, recently, performed, between, two, subjects, of, the, same, species, are, called, allografts, allografts, can, either, be, from, a, living, or, cadaveric, source, organs, that, have, been, successfully, transplanted, include, the, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, intestine, thymus, and, uterus, tissues, include, bones, tendons, both, referred, to, as, musculoskeletal, grafts, corneae, skin, heart, valves, nerves, and, veins, worldwide, the, kidneys, are, the, most, commonly, transplanted, organs, followed, by, the, liver, and, then, the, heart, corneae, and, musculoskeletal, grafts, are, the, most, commonly, transplanted, tissues, these, outnumber, organ, transplants, by, more, than, tenfold, organ, donors, may, be, living, brain, dead, or, dead, via, circulatory, death, tissue, may, be, recovered, from, donors, who, die, of, circulatory, death, as, well, as, of, brain, death, up, to, 24, hours, past, the, cessation, of, heartbeat, unlike, organs, most, tissues, with, the, exception, of, corneas, can, be, preserved, and, stored, for, up, to, five, years, meaning, they, can, be, banked, transplantation, raises, a, number, of, bioethical, issues, including, the, definition, of, death, when, and, how, consent, should, be, given, for, an, organ, to, be, transplanted, and, payment, for, organs, for, transplantation, other, ethical, issues, include, transplantation, tourism, medical, tourism, and, more, broadly, the, socio, economic, context, in, which, organ, procurement, or, transplantation, may, occur, a, particular, problem, is, organ, trafficking, there, is, also, the, ethical, issue, of, not, holding, out, false, hope, to, patients, transplantation, medicine, is, one, of, the, most, challenging, and, complex, areas, of, modern, medicine, some, of, the, key, areas, for, medical, management, are, the, problems, of, transplant, rejection, during, which, the, body, has, an, immune, response, to, the, transplanted, organ, possibly, leading, to, transplant, failure, and, the, need, to, immediately, remove, the, organ, from, the, recipient, when, possible, transplant, rejection, can, be, reduced, through, serotyping, to, determine, the, most, appropriate, donor, recipient, match, and, through, the, use, of, immunosuppressant, drugs, autografts, are, the, transplant, of, tissue, to, the, same, person, sometimes, this, is, done, with, surplus, tissue, tissue, that, can, regenerate, or, tissues, more, desperately, needed, elsewhere, examples, include, skin, grafts, vein, extraction, for, cabg, etc, sometimes, an, autograft, is, done, to, remove, the, tissue, and, then, treat, it, or, the, person, before, returning, it, examples, include, stem, cell, autograft, and, storing, blood, in, advance, of, surgery, in, a, rotationplasty, a, distal, joint, is, used, to, replace, a, more, proximal, one, typically, a, foot, or, ankle, joint, is, used, to, replace, a, knee, joint, the, person, s, foot, is, severed, and, reversed, the, knee, removed, and, the, tibia, joined, with, the, femur, an, allograft, is, a, transplant, of, an, organ, or, tissue, between, two, genetically, non, identical, members, of, the, same, species, most, human, tissue, and, organ, transplants, are, allografts, due, to, the, genetic, difference, between, the, organ, and, the, recipient, the, recipient, s, immune, system, will, identify, the, organ, as, foreign, and, attempt, to, destroy, it, causing, transplant, rejection, the, risk, of, transplant, rejection, can, be, estimated, by, measuring, the, panel, reactive, antibody, level, an, isograft, is, a, subset, of, allograft, in, which, organs, or, tissues, are, transplanted, from, a, donor, to, a, genetically, identical, recipient, such, as, an, identical, twin, isografts, are, differentiated, from, other, types, of, transplants, because, while, they, are, anatomically, identical, to, allografts, they, do, not, trigger, an, immune, response, a, xenograft, is, a, transplant, of, organs, or, tissue, from, one, species, to, another, an, example, is, porcine, heart, valve, transplant, which, is, quite, common, and, successful, another, example, is, attempted, piscine, primate, fish, to, non, human, primate, transplant, of, pancreatic, islets, the, latter, research, study, was, intended, to, pave, the, way, for, potential, human, use, if, successful, however, xenotransplantation, is, often, an, extremely, dangerous, type, of, transplant, because, of, the, increased, risk, of, non, functional, compatibility, rejection, and, disease, carried, in, the, tissue, in, the, opposite, direction, attempts, are, being, made, to, devise, a, way, to, transplant, human, fetal, hearts, and, kidneys, into, animals, for, future, transplantation, into, human, patients, to, address, the, shortage, of, donor, organs, in, people, with, cystic, fibrosis, cf, where, both, lungs, need, to, be, replaced, it, is, a, technically, easier, operation, with, a, higher, rate, of, success, to, replace, both, the, heart, and, lungs, of, the, recipient, with, those, of, the, donor, as, the, recipient, s, original, heart, is, usually, healthy, it, can, then, be, transplanted, into, a, second, recipient, in, need, of, a, heart, transplant, thus, making, the, person, with, cf, a, living, heart, donor, in, a, 2016, case, at, stanford, medical, center, a, woman, who, was, needing, a, heart, lung, transplant, had, cystic, fibrosis, which, had, led, to, one, lung, expanding, and, the, other, shrinking, thereby, displacing, her, heart, the, second, patient, who, in, turn, received, her, heart, was, a, woman, with, right, ventricular, dysplasia, which, had, led, to, a, dangerously, abnormal, rhythm, the, dual, operations, required, three, surgical, teams, including, one, to, remove, the, heart, and, lungs, from, a, recently, deceased, initial, donor, the, two, living, recipients, did, well, and, had, an, opportunity, to, meet, six, weeks, after, their, simultaneous, operations, another, example, of, this, situation, occurs, with, a, special, form, of, liver, transplant, in, which, the, recipient, has, familial, amyloid, polyneuropathy, a, disease, where, the, liver, slowly, produces, a, protein, that, damages, other, organs, the, recipient, s, liver, can, then, be, transplanted, into, an, older, person, for, whom, the, effects, of, the, disease, will, not, necessarily, contribute, significantly, to, mortality, this, term, also, refers, to, a, series, of, living, donor, transplants, in, which, one, donor, donates, to, the, highest, recipient, on, the, waiting, list, and, the, transplant, center, utilizes, that, donation, to, facilitate, multiple, transplants, these, other, transplants, are, otherwise, impossible, due, to, blood, type, or, antibody, barriers, to, transplantation, the, good, samaritan, kidney, is, transplanted, into, one, of, the, other, recipients, whose, donor, in, turn, donates, his, or, her, kidney, to, an, unrelated, recipient, this, method, allows, all, organ, recipients, to, get, a, transplant, even, if, their, living, donor, is, not, a, match, for, them, this, further, benefits, people, below, any, of, these, recipients, on, waiting, lists, as, they, move, closer, to, the, top, of, the, list, for, a, deceased, donor, organ, johns, hopkins, hospital, in, baltimore, and, northwestern, university, s, northwestern, memorial, hospital, have, received, significant, attention, for, pioneering, transplants, of, this, kind, in, february, 2012, the, last, link, in, a, record, 60, person, domino, chain, of, 30, kidney, transplants, was, completed, in, may, 2023, new, york, presbyterian, morgan, stanley, children, s, hospital, performed, the, first, domino, heart, transplantation, in, a, baby, eventually, saving, two, baby, girls, because, very, young, children, generally, under, 12, months, but, often, as, old, as, 24, months, do, not, have, a, well, developed, immune, system, it, is, possible, for, them, to, receive, organs, from, otherwise, incompatible, donors, this, is, known, as, abo, incompatible, aboi, transplantation, graft, survival, and, people, s, mortality, are, approximately, the, same, between, aboi, and, abo, compatible, aboc, recipients, while, focus, has, been, on, infant, heart, transplants, the, principles, generally, apply, to, other, forms, of, solid, organ, transplantation, the, most, important, factors, are, that, the, recipient, not, have, produced, isohemagglutinins, and, that, they, have, low, levels, of, t, cell, independent, antigens, united, network, for, organ, sharing, unos, regulations, allow, for, aboi, transplantation, in, children, under, two, years, of, age, if, isohemagglutinin, titers, are, 1, 4, or, below, and, if, there, is, no, matching, aboc, recipient, studies, have, shown, that, the, period, under, which, a, recipient, may, undergo, aboi, transplantation, may, be, prolonged, by, exposure, to, nonself, a, and, b, antigens, furthermore, should, the, recipient, for, example, type, b, positive, with, a, type, ab, positive, graft, require, eventual, retransplantation, the, recipient, may, receive, a, new, organ, of, either, blood, type, limited, success, has, been, achieved, in, abo, incompatible, heart, transplants, in, adults, though, this, requires, that, the, adult, recipients, have, low, levels, of, anti, a, or, anti, b, antibodies, renal, transplantation, is, more, successful, with, similar, long, term, graft, survival, rates, to, aboc, transplants, until, recently, people, with, obesity, were, not, considered, appropriate, candidate, donors, for, renal, transplantation, in, 2009, the, physicians, at, the, university, of, illinois, medical, center, performed, the, first, robotic, renal, transplantation, in, an, obese, recipient, and, have, continued, to, transplant, people, with, a, body, mass, index, over, 35, using, robotic, surgery, as, of, january, 2014, over, 100, people, who, would, otherwise, have, been, turned, down, because, of, their, weight, have, successfully, been, transplanted, human, herpesvirus, 6, hhv, 6, reactivation, emerges, as, a, notable, concern, in, pediatric, liver, transplantation, potentially, influencing, both, graft, and, recipient, health, hhv, 6, prevalent, in, a, substantial, portion, of, the, population, can, manifest, in, liver, transplant, recipients, with, inherited, chromosomally, integrated, hhv, 6, icihhv, 6, predisposing, them, to, heightened, risks, of, complications, such, as, graft, versus, host, disease, and, allograft, rejections, recent, case, studies, underscore, the, significance, of, hhv, 6, reactivation, demonstrating, its, ability, to, infect, liver, grafts, and, impact, recipient, outcomes, clinical, management, involves, early, detection, targeted, antiviral, therapy, and, vigilant, monitoring, post, transplantation, with, future, research, aimed, at, optimizing, preventive, measures, and, therapeutic, interventions, to, mitigate, the, impact, of, hhv, 6, reactivation, on, pediatric, liver, transplant, outcomes, the, main, complications, are, procedural, complications, infection, acute, rejection, cardiac, allograft, vasculopathy, and, malignancy, non, vascular, and, vascular, complications, can, occur, in, the, initial, post, transplant, phase, and, at, later, stages, overall, postoperative, complications, after, kidney, transplantation, occur, in, approximately, 12, to, 25, of, kidney, transplant, patients, organ, donors, may, be, living, or, may, have, died, of, brain, death, or, circulatory, death, most, deceased, donors, are, those, who, have, been, pronounced, brain, dead, brain, dead, means, the, cessation, of, brain, function, typically, after, receiving, an, injury, either, traumatic, or, pathological, to, the, brain, or, otherwise, cutting, off, blood, circulation, to, the, brain, drowning, suffocation, etc, breathing, is, maintained, via, artificial, sources, which, in, turn, maintains, heartbeat, once, brain, death, has, been, declared, the, person, can, be, considered, for, organ, donation, criteria, for, brain, death, vary, because, less, than, 3, of, all, deaths, in, the, us, are, the, result, of, brain, death, the, overwhelming, majority, of, deaths, are, ineligible, for, organ, donation, resulting, in, severe, shortages, it, is, important, to, note, currently, that, patients, that, have, been, pronounced, brain, dead, are, one, of, the, most, common, and, ideal, donors, since, often, these, donors, are, young, and, healthy, thus, leading, to, high, quality, organs, organ, donation, is, possible, after, cardiac, death, in, some, situations, primarily, when, the, person, is, severely, brain, injured, and, not, expected, to, survive, without, artificial, breathing, and, mechanical, support, independent, of, any, decision, to, donate, a, person, s, next, of, kin, may, decide, to, end, artificial, support, if, the, person, is, expected, to, expire, within, a, short, period, of, time, after, support, is, withdrawn, arrangements, can, be, made, to, withdraw, that, support, in, an, operating, room, to, allow, quick, recovery, of, the, organs, after, circulatory, death, has, occurred, tissues, may, be, recovered, from, donors, who, die, of, either, brain, or, circulatory, death, in, general, tissues, may, be, recovered, from, donors, up, to, 24, hours, past, the, cessation, of, heartbeat, in, contrast, to, organs, most, tissues, with, the, exception, of, corneas, can, be, preserved, and, stored, for, up, to, five, years, meaning, they, can, be, banked, also, more, than, 60, grafts, may, be, obtained, from, a, single, tissue, donor, because, of, these, three, factors, the, ability, to, recover, from, a, non, heart, beating, donor, the, ability, to, bank, tissue, and, the, number, of, grafts, available, from, each, donor, tissue, transplants, are, much, more, common, than, organ, transplants, the, american, association, of, tissue, banks, estimates, that, more, than, one, million, tissue, transplants, take, place, in, the, united, states, each, year, in, living, donors, the, donor, remains, alive, and, donates, a, renewable, tissue, cell, or, fluid, e, g, blood, skin, or, donates, an, organ, or, part, of, an, organ, in, which, the, remaining, organ, can, regenerate, or, take, on, the, workload, of, the, rest, of, the, organ, primarily, single, kidney, donation, partial, donation, of, liver, lung, lobe, small, bowel, regenerative, medicine, may, one, day, allow, for, laboratory, grown, organs, using, person, s, own, cells, via, stem, cells, or, healthy, cells, extracted, from, the, failing, organs, deceased, donors, formerly, cadaveric, are, people, who, have, been, declared, brain, dead, and, whose, organs, are, kept, viable, by, ventilators, or, other, mechanical, mechanisms, until, they, can, be, excised, for, transplantation, apart, from, brainstem, dead, donors, who, have, formed, the, majority, of, deceased, donors, for, the, last, 20, years, there, is, increasing, use, of, after, circulatory, death, donors, formerly, non, heart, beating, donors, to, increase, the, potential, pool, of, donors, as, demand, for, transplants, continues, to, grow, prior, to, the, legal, recognition, of, brain, death, in, the, 1980s, all, deceased, organ, donors, had, died, of, circulatory, death, these, organs, have, inferior, outcomes, to, organs, from, a, brain, dead, donor, for, instance, patients, who, underwent, liver, transplantation, using, donation, after, circulatory, death, allografts, have, been, shown, to, have, significantly, lower, graft, survival, than, those, from, donation, after, brain, death, allografts, due, to, biliary, complications, and, primary, nonfunction, in, liver, transplantation, however, given, the, scarcity, of, suitable, organs, and, the, number, of, people, who, die, waiting, any, potentially, suitable, organ, must, be, considered, jurisdictions, with, medically, assisted, suicide, may, co, ordinate, organ, donations, from, that, source, in, most, countries, there, is, a, shortage, of, suitable, organs, for, transplantation, countries, often, have, formal, systems, in, place, to, manage, the, process, of, determining, who, is, an, organ, donor, and, in, what, order, organ, recipients, receive, available, organs, the, overwhelming, majority, of, deceased, donor, organs, in, the, united, states, are, allocated, by, federal, contract, to, the, organ, procurement, and, transplantation, network, held, since, it, was, created, by, the, organ, transplant, act, of, 1984, by, the, united, network, for, organ, sharing, or, unos, unos, does, not, handle, donor, cornea, tissue, corneal, donor, tissue, is, usually, handled, by, multiple, eye, banks, with, guidance, from, the, eye, bank, association, of, america, ebaa, and, food, and, drug, administration, fda, individual, regional, organ, procurement, organizations, all, members, of, the, organ, procurement, and, transplantation, network, are, responsible, for, the, identification, of, suitable, donors, and, collection, of, the, donated, organs, unos, then, allocates, organs, based, on, the, method, considered, most, fair, by, the, leadership, in, the, field, the, allocation, methodology, varies, somewhat, by, organ, and, changes, periodically, for, example, liver, allocation, is, based, partially, on, meld, score, model, of, end, stage, liver, disease, an, empirical, score, based, on, lab, values, indicative, of, the, sickness, of, the, person, from, liver, disease, in, 1984, the, national, organ, transplant, act, nota, was, passed, it, gave, way, to, the, organ, procurement, and, transplantation, network, which, maintains, the, organ, registry, and, ensures, equitable, allocation, of, organs, the, scientific, registry, of, transplant, recipients, was, also, established, to, conduct, ongoing, studies, into, the, evaluation, and, clinical, status, of, organ, transplants, in, 2000, the, children, s, health, act, passed, and, required, nota, to, consider, special, issues, around, pediatric, patients, and, organ, allocation, an, example, of, line, jumping, occurred, in, 2003, at, duke, university, when, doctors, attempted, to, correct, an, initially, incorrect, transplant, an, american, teenager, received, a, heart, lung, donation, with, the, wrong, blood, type, for, her, she, then, received, a, second, transplant, even, though, she, was, then, in, such, poor, physical, shape, that, she, normally, would, not, be, considered, a, good, candidate, for, a, transplant, in, an, april, 2008, article, in, the, guardian, steven, tsui, the, head, of, the, transplant, team, at, papworth, hospital, in, the, uk, is, quoted, in, raising, the, ethical, issue, of, not, holding, out, false, hope, he, stated, conventionally, we, would, say, if, people, s, life, expectancy, was, a, year, or, less, we, would, consider, them, a, candidate, for, a, heart, transplant, but, we, also, have, to, manage, expectations, if, we, know, that, in, an, average, year, we, will, do, 30, heart, transplants, there, is, no, point, putting, 60, people, on, our, waiting, list, because, we, know, half, of, them, will, die, and, it, s, not, right, to, give, them, false, hope, experiencing, somewhat, increased, popularity, but, still, very, rare, is, directed, or, targeted, donation, in, which, the, family, of, a, deceased, donor, often, honoring, the, wishes, of, the, deceased, requests, an, organ, be, given, to, a, specific, person, subverting, the, allocation, system, in, the, united, states, there, are, various, lengths, of, waiting, times, due, to, the, different, availabilities, of, organs, in, different, unos, regions, in, other, countries, such, as, the, uk, only, medical, factors, and, the, position, on, the, waiting, list, can, affect, who, receives, the, organ, one, of, the, more, publicized, cases, of, this, type, was, the, 1994, chester, and, patti, szuber, transplant, this, was, the, first, time, that, a, parent, had, received, a, heart, donated, by, one, of, their, own, children, although, the, decision, to, accept, the, heart, from, his, recently, killed, child, was, not, an, easy, decision, the, szuber, family, agreed, that, giving, patti, s, heart, to, her, father, would, have, been, something, that, she, would, have, wanted, access, to, organ, transplantation, is, one, reason, for, the, growth, of, medical, tourism, living, related, donors, donate, to, family, members, or, friends, in, whom, they, have, an, emotional, investment, the, risk, of, surgery, is, offset, by, the, psychological, benefit, of, not, losing, someone, related, to, them, or, not, seeing, them, suffer, the, ill, effects, of, waiting, on, a, list, a, paired, exchange, is, a, technique, of, matching, willing, living, donors, to, compatible, recipients, using, serotyping, for, example, a, spouse, may, be, willing, to, donate, a, kidney, to, their, partner, but, cannot, since, there, is, not, a, biological, match, the, willing, spouse, s, kidney, is, donated, to, a, matching, recipient, who, also, has, an, incompatible, but, willing, spouse, the, second, donor, must, match, the, first, recipient, to, complete, the, pair, exchange, typically, the, surgeries, are, scheduled, simultaneously, in, case, one, of, the, donors, decides, to, back, out, and, the, couples, are, kept, anonymous, from, each, other, until, after, the, transplant, paired, donor, exchange, led, by, work, in, the, new, england, program, for, kidney, exchange, as, well, as, at, johns, hopkins, university, and, the, ohio, organ, procurement, organizations, may, more, efficiently, allocate, organs, and, lead, to, more, transplants, paired, exchange, programs, were, popularized, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, article, ethics, of, a, paired, kidney, exchange, program, in, 1997, by, l, f, ross, it, was, also, proposed, by, felix, t, rapport, in, 1986, as, part, of, his, initial, proposals, for, live, donor, transplants, the, case, for, a, living, emotionally, related, international, kidney, donor, exchange, registry, in, transplant, proceedings, a, paired, exchange, is, the, simplest, case, of, a, much, larger, exchange, registry, program, where, willing, donors, are, matched, with, any, number, of, compatible, recipients, transplant, exchange, programs, have, been, suggested, as, early, as, 1970, a, cooperative, kidney, typing, and, exchange, program, the, first, pair, exchange, transplant, in, the, us, was, in, 2001, at, johns, hopkins, hospital, the, first, complex, multihospital, kidney, exchange, involving, 12, people, was, performed, in, february, 2009, by, the, johns, hopkins, hospital, barnes, jewish, hospital, in, st, louis, and, integris, baptist, medical, center, in, oklahoma, city, another, 12, person, multihospital, kidney, exchange, was, performed, four, weeks, later, by, saint, barnabas, medical, center, in, livingston, new, jersey, newark, beth, israel, medical, center, and, new, york, presbyterian, hospital, surgical, teams, led, by, johns, hopkins, continue, to, pioneer, this, field, with, more, complex, chains, of, exchange, such, as, an, eight, way, multihospital, kidney, exchange, in, december, 2009, a, 13, organ, 13, recipient, matched, kidney, exchange, took, place, coordinated, through, georgetown, university, hospital, and, washington, hospital, center, washington, dc, good, samaritan, or, altruistic, donation, is, giving, a, donation, to, someone, that, has, no, prior, affiliation, with, the, donor, the, idea, of, altruistic, donation, is, to, give, with, no, interest, of, personal, gain, it, is, out, of, pure, selflessness, on, the, other, hand, the, current, allocation, system, does, not, assess, a, donor, s, motive, so, altruistic, donation, is, not, a, requirement, some, people, choose, to, do, this, out, of, a, personal, need, to, donate, some, donate, to, the, next, person, on, the, list, others, use, some, method, of, choosing, a, recipient, based, on, criteria, important, to, them, websites, are, being, developed, that, facilitate, such, donation, over, half, of, the, members, of, the, jesus, christians, an, australian, religious, group, have, donated, kidneys, in, such, a, fashion, monetary, compensation, for, organ, donors, in, the, form, of, reimbursement, for, out, of, pocket, expenses, has, been, legalised, in, australia, and, strictly, only, in, the, case, of, kidney, transplant, in, the, case, of, singapore, minimal, reimbursement, is, offered, in, the, case, of, other, forms, of, organ, harvesting, by, singapore, kidney, disease, organizations, in, both, countries, have, expressed, their, support, in, compensated, donation, donors, get, money, or, other, compensation, in, exchange, for, their, organs, this, practice, is, common, in, some, parts, of, the, world, whether, legal, or, not, and, is, one, of, the, many, factors, driving, medical, tourism, in, the, illegal, black, market, the, donors, may, not, get, sufficient, after, operation, care, the, price, of, a, kidney, may, be, above, 160, 000, middlemen, take, most, of, the, money, the, operation, is, more, dangerous, to, both, the, donor, and, receiver, and, the, receiver, often, gets, hepatitis, or, hiv, in, legal, markets, of, iran, the, price, of, a, kidney, is, 2, 000, to, 4, 000, an, article, by, gary, becker, and, julio, elias, on, introducing, incentives, in, the, market, for, live, and, cadaveric, organ, donations, said, that, a, free, market, could, help, solve, the, problem, of, a, scarcity, in, organ, transplants, their, economic, modeling, was, able, to, estimate, the, price, tag, for, human, kidneys, 15, 000, and, human, livers, 32, 000, in, the, united, states, the, national, organ, transplant, act, of, 1984, made, organ, sales, illegal, in, the, united, kingdom, the, human, organ, transplants, act, 1989, first, made, organ, sales, illegal, and, has, been, superseded, by, the, human, tissue, act, 2004, in, 2007, two, major, european, conferences, recommended, against, the, sale, of, organs, recent, development, of, websites, and, personal, advertisements, for, organs, among, listed, candidates, has, raised, the, stakes, when, it, comes, to, the, selling, of, organs, and, have, also, sparked, significant, ethical, debates, over,

internet, may, actually, increase, the, overall, supply, of, organs, in, an, experimental, survey, elias, lacetera, and, macis, 2019, find, that, preferences, for, compensation, for, kidney, donors, have, strong, moral, foundations, participants, in, the, experiment, especially, reject, direct, payments, by, patients, which, they, find, would, violate, principles, of, fairness, many, countries, have, different, approaches, to, organ, donation, such, as, the, opt, out, approach, and, many, advertisements, of, organ, donors, encouraging, people, to, donate, although, these, laws, have, been, implemented, in, a, certain, country, they, are, not, forced, upon, everyone, as, it, is, an, individual, decision, two, books, kidney, for, sale, by, owner, by, mark, cherry, georgetown, university,

supply, of, organs, available, for, transplantation, in, a, 2004, journal, article, economist, alex, tabarrok, argues, that, allowing, organ, sales, and, elimination, of, organ, donor, lists, will, increase, supply, lower, costs, and, diminish, social, anxiety, towards, organ, markets, iran, has, had, a, legal, market, for, kidneys, since, 1988, the, donor, is, paid, approximately, us, 1200, by, the, government, and, also, usually, receives, additional, funds, from, either, the, recipient, or, local, charities, the, economist, and, the, ayn, rand, institute, approve, and, advocate, a, legal, market, elsewhere, they, argued, that, if, 0, 06, of, americans, between, 19, and, 65, were, to, sell, one, kidney, the, national, waiting, list, would, disappear, which, the, economist, wrote, happened, in, iran, the, economist, argued, that, donating, kidneys, is, no, more, risky, than, surrogate, motherhood, which, can, be, done, legally, for, pay, in, most, countries, in, pakistan, 40, percent, to, 50, percent, of, the, residents, of, some, villages, have, only, one, kidney, because, they, have, sold, the, other, for, a, transplant, into, a, wealthy, person, probably, from, another, country, said, dr, farhat, moazam, of, pakistan, at, a, world, health, organization, conference, pakistani, donors, are, offered, 2, 500, for, a, kidney, but, receive, only, about, half, of, that, because, middlemen, take, so, much, in, chennai, southern, india, poor, fishermen, and, their, families, sold, kidneys, after, their, livelihoods, were, destroyed, by, the, indian, ocean, tsunami, on, 26, december, 2004, about, 100, people, mostly, women, sold, their, kidneys, for, 40, 000, 60, 000, rupees, 900, 1, 350, thilakavathy, agatheesh, 30, who, sold, a, kidney, in, may, 2005, for, 40, 000,

kidney, was, a, mistake, in, cyprus, in, 2010, police, closed, a, fertility, clinic, under, charges, of, trafficking, in, human, eggs, the, petra, clinic, as, it, was, known, locally, brought, in, women, from, ukraine, and, russia, for, egg, harvesting, and, sold, the, genetic, material, to, foreign, fertility, tourists, this, sort, of, reproductive, trafficking, violates, laws, in, the, european, union, in, 2010, scott, carney, reported, for, the, pulitzer, center, on, crisis, reporting, and, the, magazine, fast, company, explored, illicit, fertility, networks, in, spain, the, united, states, and, israel, there, have, been, concerns, that, certain, authorities, are, harvesting, organs, from, people, deemed, undesirable, such, as, prison, populations, the, world, medical, association, stated, that, prisoners, and, other, individuals, in, custody, are, not, in, a, position, to, give, consent, freely, and, therefore, their, organs, must, not, be, used, for, transplantation, according, to, former, chinese, deputy, minister, of, health, huang, jiefu, the, practice, of, transplanting, organs, from, executed, prisoners, is, still, occurring, as, of, february, 2017, world, journal, reported, huang, had, admitted, approximately, 95, of, all, organs, used, for, transplantation, are, from, executed, prisoners, the, lack, of, a, public, organ, donation, program, in, china, is, used, as, a, justification, for, this, practice, in, july, 2006, the, kilgour, matas, report, stated, the, source, of, 41, 500, transplants, for, the, six, year, period, 2000, to, 2005, is, unexplained, and, we, believe, that, there, has, been, and, continues, today, to, be, large, scale, organ, seizures, from, unwilling, falun, gong, practitioners, investigative, journalist, ethan, gutmann, estimates, 65, 000, falun, gong, practitioners, were, killed, for, their, organs, from, 2000, to, 2008, however, 2016, reports, updated, the, death, toll, of, the, 15, year, period, since, the, persecution, of, falun, gong, began, putting, the, death, toll, at, 150, 000, to, 1, 5, million, in, december, 2006, after, not, getting, assurances, from, the, chinese, government, about, allegations, relating, to, chinese, prisoners, the, two, major, organ, transplant, hospitals, in, queensland, australia, stopped, transplantation, training, for, chinese, surgeons, and, banned, joint, research, programs, into, organ, transplantation, with, china, in, may, 2008, two, united, nations, special, rapporteurs, reiterated, their, requests, for, the, chinese, government, to, fully, explain, the, allegation, of, taking, vital, organs, from, falun, gong, practitioners, and, the, source, of, organs, for, the, sudden, increase, in, organ, transplants, that, has, been, going, on, in, china, since, the, year, 2000, people, in, other, parts, of, the, world, are, responding, to, this, availability, of, organs, and, a, number, of, individuals, including, us, and, japanese, citizens, have, elected, to, travel, to, china, or, india, as, medical, tourists, to, receive, organ, transplants, which, may, have, been, sourced, in, what, might, be, considered, elsewhere, to, be, unethical, manner, some, estimates, of, the, number, of, transplants, performed, in, various, regions, of, the, world, have, been, derived, from, the, global, burden, of, disease, study, pmp, pmp, pmp, according, to, the, council, of, europe, spain, through, the, spanish, transplant, organization, shows, the, highest, worldwide, rate, of, 35, 1, donors, per, million, population, in, 2005, and, 33, 8, in, 2006, in, 2011, it, was, 35, 3, in, addition, to, the, citizens, waiting, for, organ, transplants, in, the, us, and, other, developed, nations, there, are, long, waiting, lists, in, the, rest, of, the, world, more, than, 2, million, people, need, organ, transplants, in, china, 50, 000, waiting, in, latin, america, 90, of, whom, are, waiting, for, kidneys, as, well, as, thousands, more, in, the, less, documented, continent, of, africa, donor, bases, vary, in, developing, nations, in, latin, america, the, donor, rate, is, 40, 100, per, million, per, year, similar, to, that, of, developed, countries, however, in, uruguay, cuba, and, chile, 90, of, organ, transplants, came, from, cadaveric, donors, cadaveric, donors, represent, 35, of, donors, in, saudi, arabia, there, is, continuous, effort, to, increase, the, utilization, of, cadaveric, donors, in, asia, however, the, popularity, of, living, single, kidney, donors, in, india, yields, a, cadaveric, donor, prevalence, of, less, than, 1, per, million, population, traditionally, muslims, believe, body, desecration, in, life, or, death, to, be, forbidden, and, thus, many, reject, organ, transplant, however, most, muslim, authorities, nowadays, accept, the, practice, if, another, life, will, be, saved, as, an, example, it, may, be, assumed, in, countries, such, as, singapore, with, a, cosmopolitan, populace, that, includes, muslims, a, special, majlis, ugama, islam, singapura, governing, body, is, formed, to, look, after, the, interests, of, singapore, s, muslim, community, over, issues, that, includes, their, burial, arrangements, organ, transplantation, in, singapore, is, generally, overseen, by, the, national, organ, transplant, unit, of, the, ministry, of, health, singapore, due, to, a, diversity, in, mindsets, and, religious, viewpoints, while, muslims, on, this, island, are, generally, not, expected, to, donate, their, organs, even, upon, death, youth, in, singapore, are, educated, on, the, human, organ, transplant, act, at, the, age, of, 18, which, is, around, the, age, of, military, conscription, the, organ, donor, registry, maintains, two, types, of, information, firstly, people, of, singapore, that, donate, their, organs, or, bodies, for, transplantation, research, or, education, upon, their, death, under, the, medical, therapy, education, and, research, act, mtera, and, secondly, people, that, object, to, the, removal, of, kidneys, liver, heart, and, corneas, upon, death, for, the, purpose, of, transplantation, under, the, human, organ, transplant, act, hota, the, live, on, social, awareness, movement, is, also, formed, to, educate, singaporeans, on, organ, donation, organ, transplantation, in, china, has, taken, place, since, the, 1960s, and, china, has, one, of, the, largest, transplant, programmes, in, the, world, peaking, at, over, 13, 000, transplants, a, year, by, 2004, organ, donation, however, is, against, chinese, tradition, and, culture, and, involuntary, organ, donation, is, illegal, under, chinese, law, china, s, transplant, programme, attracted, the, attention, of, international, news, media, in, the, 1990s, due, to, ethical, concerns, about, the, organs, and, tissue, removed, from, the, corpses, of, executed, criminals, being, commercially, traded, in, 2006, it, became, clear, that, about, 41, 500, organs, had, been, sourced, from, falun, gong, practitioners, in, china, since, 2000, with, regard, to, organ, transplantation, in, israel, there, is, a, severe, organ, shortage, due, to, religious, objections, by, some, rabbis, who, oppose, all, organ, donations, and, others, who, advocate, that, a, rabbi, participate, in, all, decision, making, regarding, a, particular, donor, one, third, of, all, heart, transplants, performed, on, israelis, are, done, in, china, others, are, done, in, europe, dr, jacob, lavee, head, of, the, heart, transplant, unit, sheba, medical, center, tel, aviv, believes, that, transplant, tourism, is, unethical, and, israeli, insurers, should, not, pay, for, it, the, organization, hods, halachic, organ, donor, society, is, working, to, increase, knowledge, and, participation, in, organ, donation, among, jews, throughout, the, world, transplantation, rates, also, differ, based, on, race, sex, and, income, a, study, done, with, people, beginning, long, term, dialysis, showed, that, the, sociodemographic, barriers, to, renal, transplantation, present, themselves, even, before, patients, are, on, the, transplant, list, for, example, different, groups, express, definite, interest, and, complete, pretransplant, workup, at, different, rates, previous, efforts, to, create, fair, transplantation, policies, had, focused, on, people, currently, on, the, transplantation, waiting, list, in, the, united, states, nearly, 35, 000, organ, transplants, were, done, in, 2017, a, 3, 4, percent, increase, over, 2016, about, 18, percent, of, these, were, from, living, donors, people, who, gave, one, kidney, or, a, part, of, their, liver, to, someone, else, but, 115, 000, americans, remain, on, waiting, lists, for, organ, transplants, by, september, 2022, the, us, had, reached, one, million, organ, transplants, overall, successful, human, allotransplants, have, a, relatively, long, history, of, operative, skills, that, were, present, long, before, the, necessities, for, post, operative, survival, were, discovered, rejection, and, the, side, effects, of, preventing, rejection, especially, infection, and, nephropathy, were, are, and, may, always, be, the, key, problem, several, apocryphal, accounts, of, transplants, exist, well, prior, to, the, scientific, understanding, and, advancements, that, would, be, necessary, for, them, to, have, actually, occurred, the, chinese, physician, pien, chi, ao, reportedly, exchanged, hearts, between, a, man, of, strong, spirit, but, weak, will, with, one, of, a, man, of, weak, spirit, but, strong, will, in, an, attempt, to, achieve, balance, in, each, man, roman, catholic, accounts, report, the, 3rd, century, saints, damian, and, cosmas, as, replacing, the, gangrenous, or, cancerous, leg, of, the, roman, deacon, justinian, with, the, leg, of, a, recently, deceased, ethiopian, most, accounts, have, the, saints, performing, the, transplant, in, the, 4th, century, many, decades, after, their, deaths, some, accounts, have, them, only, instructing, living, surgeons, who, performed, the, procedure, the, more, likely, accounts, of, early, transplants, deal, with, skin, transplantation, the, first, reasonable, account, is, of, the, indian, surgeon, sushruta, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, who, used, autografted, skin, transplantation, in, nose, reconstruction, a, rhinoplasty, success, or, failure, of, these, procedures, is, not, well, documented, centuries, later, the, italian, surgeon, gasparo, tagliacozzi, performed, successful, skin, autografts, he, also, failed, consistently, with, allografts, offering, the, first, suggestion, of, rejection, centuries, before, that, mechanism, could, possibly, be, understood, he, attributed, it, to, the, force, and, power, of, individuality, in, his, 1596, work, de, curtorum, chirurgia, per, insitionem, the, first, successful, corneal, allograft, transplant, was, performed, in, 1837, in, a, gazelle, model, the, first, successful, human, corneal, transplant, a, keratoplastic, operation, was, performed, by, eduard, zirm, at, olomouc, eye, clinic, now, in, the, czech, republic, in, 1905, the, first, transplant, in, the, modern, sense, the, implantation, of, organ, tissue, in, order, to, replace, an, organ, function, was, a, thyroid, transplant, in, 1883, it, was, performed, by, the, swiss, surgeon, and, later, nobel, laureate, theodor, kocher, in, the, preceding, decades, kocher, had, perfected, the, removal, of, excess, thyroid, tissue, in, cases, of, goiter, to, an, extent, that, he, was, able, to, remove, the, whole, organ, without, the, person, dying, from, the, operation, kocher, carried, out, the, total, removal, of, the, organ, in, some, cases, as, a, measure, to, prevent, recurrent, goiter, by, 1883, the, surgeon, noticed, that, the, complete, removal, of, the, organ, leads, to, a, complex, of, particular, symptoms, that, we, today, have, learned, to, associate, with, a, lack, of, thyroid, hormone, kocher, reversed, these, symptoms, by, implanting, thyroid, tissue, to, these, people, and, thus, performed, the, first, organ, transplant, in, the, following, years, kocher, and, other, surgeons, used, thyroid, transplantation, also, to, treat, thyroid, deficiency, that, appeared, spontaneously, without, a, preceding, organ, removal, thyroid, transplantation, became, the, model, for, a, whole, new, therapeutic, strategy, organ, transplantation, after, the, example, of, the, thyroid, other, organs, were, transplanted, in, the, decades, around, 1900, some, of, these, transplants, were, done, in, animals, for, purposes, of, research, where, organ, removal, and, transplantation, became, a, successful, strategy, of, investigating, the, function, of, organs, kocher, was, awarded, his, nobel, prize, in, 1909, for, the, discovery, of, the, function, of, the, thyroid, gland, at, the, same, time, organs, were, also, transplanted, for, treating, diseases, in, humans, the, thyroid, gland, became, the, model, for, transplants, of, adrenal, and, parathyroid, glands, pancreas, ovary, testicles, and, kidney, by, 1900, the, idea, that, one, can, successfully, treat, internal, diseases, by, replacing, a, failed, organ, through, transplantation, had, been, generally, accepted, pioneering, work, in, the, surgical, technique, of, transplantation, was, made, in, the, early, 1900s, by, the, french, surgeon, alexis, carrel, with, charles, guthrie, with, the, transplantation, of, arteries, or, veins, their, skillful, anastomosis, operations, and, the, new, suturing, techniques, laid, the, groundwork, for, later, transplant, surgery, and, won, carrel, the, 1912, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, from, 1902, carrel, performed, transplant, experiments, on, dogs, surgically, successful, in, moving, kidneys, hearts, and, spleens, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, identify, the, problem, of, rejection, which, remained, insurmountable, for, decades, the, discovery, of, transplant, immunity, by, the, german, surgeon, georg, sch, ne, various, strategies, of, matching, donor, and, recipient, and, the, use, of, different, agents, for, immune, suppression, did, not, result, in, substantial, improvement, so, that, organ, transplantation, was, largely, abandoned, after, wwi, in, 1954, the, first, ever, successful, transplant, of, any, organ, was, done, at, the, brigham, women, s, hospital, in, boston, the, surgery, was, performed, by, american, surgeon, dr, joseph, murray, who, received, the, nobel, prize, in, medicine, for, his, work, the, success, of, this, transplant, was, mostly, due, to, the, family, relation, between, the, recipient, a, richard, herrick, of, maine, and, his, donor, and, identical, twin, brother, ronald, richard, herrick, was, in, the, navy, and, became, severely, ill, with, acute, renal, failure, his, brother, ronald, donated, his, kidney, to, richard, and, richard, lived, on, for, another, eight, years, prior, to, this, case, transplant, recipients, did, not, survive, for, more, than, thirty, days, their, close, family, relation, meant, there, was, no, need, for, anti, rejection, medications, which, was, not, known, until, this, time, so, the, case, shed, light, on, the, cause, of, rejection, and, of, possible, anti, rejection, medicine, major, steps, in, skin, transplantation, occurred, during, the, first, world, war, notably, in, the, work, of, harold, gillies, at, aldershot, united, kingdom, among, his, advances, was, the, tubed, pedicle, graft, which, maintained, a, flesh, connection, from, the, donor, site, until, the, graft, established, its, own, blood, flow, gillies, assistant, archibald, mcindoe, carried, on, the, work, into, the, second, world, war, as, reconstructive, surgery, in, 1962, the, first, successful, replantation, surgery, was, performed, re, attaching, a, severed, limb, and, restoring, limited, function, and, feeling, transplant, of, a, single, gonad, testis, from, a, living, donor, was, carried, out, in, early, july, 1926, in, zaje, ar, serbia, by, a, russian, migr, surgeon, dr, peter, vasil, evi, kolesnikov, the, donor, was, a, convicted, murderer, one, ilija, krajan, whose, death, sentence, was, commuted, to, 20, years, imprisonment, and, he, was, led, to, believe, that, it, was, done, because, he, had, donated, his, testis, to, an, elderly, medical, doctor, both, the, donor, and, the, receiver, survived, but, charges, were, brought, in, a, court, of, law, by, the, public, prosecutor, against, dr, kolesnikov, not, for, performing, the, operation, but, for, lying, to, the, donor, the, first, attempted, human, deceased, donor, transplant, was, performed, by, the, ukrainian, surgeon, yurii, voronoy, in, the, 1930s, but, failed, due, to, ischemia, joseph, murray, and, j, hartwell, harrison, performed, the, first, successful, transplant, a, kidney, transplant, between, identical, twins, in, 1954, because, no, immunosuppression, was, necessary, for, genetically, identical, individuals, in, the, late, 1940s, british, surgeon, peter, medawar, working, for, the, national, institute, for, medical, research, improved, the, understanding, of, rejection, identifying, the, immune, reactions, in, 1951, medawar, suggested, that, immunosuppressive, drugs, could, be, used, cortisone, had, been, recently, discovered, and, the, more, effective, azathioprine, was, identified, in, 1959, but, it, was, not, until, the, discovery, of, cyclosporine, in, 1970, that, transplant, surgery, found, a, sufficiently, powerful, immunosuppressive, there, was, a, successful, deceased, donor, lung, transplant, into, an, emphysema, and, lung, cancer, patient, in, june, 1963, by, james, hardy, at, the, university, of, mississippi, medical, center, in, jackson, mississippi, the, patient, john, russell, survived, for, eighteen, days, before, dying, of, kidney, failure, thomas, starzl, of, denver, attempted, a, liver, transplant, in, the, same, year, but, he, was, not, successful, until, 1967, in, the, early, 1960s, and, prior, to, long, term, dialysis, becoming, available, keith, reemtsma, and, his, colleagues, at, tulane, university, in, new, orleans, attempted, transplants, of, chimpanzee, kidneys, into, 13, human, patients, most, of, these, patients, only, lived, one, to, two, months, however, in, 1964, a, 23, year, old, woman, lived, for, nine, months, and, even, returned, to, her, job, as, a, school, teacher, until, she, suddenly, collapsed, and, died, it, was, assumed, that, she, died, from, an, acute, electrolyte, disturbance, at, autopsy, the, kidneys, had, not, been, rejected, nor, was, there, any, other, obvious, cause, of, death, one, source, states, this, patient, died, from, pneumonia, tom, starzl, and, his, team, in, colorado, used, baboon, kidneys, with, six, human, patients, who, lived, one, or, two, months, but, with, no, longer, term, survivors, others, in, the, united, states, and, france, had, limited, experiences, the, heart, was, a, major, prize, for, transplant, surgeons, but, over, and, above, rejection, issues, the, heart, deteriorates, within, minutes, of, death, so, any, operation, would, have, to, be, performed, at, great, speed, the, development, of, the, heart, lung, machine, was, also, needed, lung, pioneer, james, hardy, was, prepared, to, attempt, a, human, heart, transplant, in, 1964, but, when, a, premature, failure, of, comatose, boyd, rush, s, heart, caught, hardy, with, no, human, donor, he, used, a, chimpanzee, heart, which, beat, in, his, patient, s, chest, for, approximately, one, hour, and, then, failed, the, first, partial, success, was, achieved, on, 3, december, 1967, when, christiaan, barnard, of, cape, town, south, africa, performed, the, world, s, first, human, to, human, heart, transplant, with, patient, louis, washkansky, as, the, recipient, washkansky, survived, for, eighteen, days, amid, what, many, saw, as, a, distasteful, publicity, circus, the, media, interest, prompted, a, spate, of, heart, transplants, over, a, hundred, were, performed, in, 1968, 1969, but, almost, all, the, people, died, within, 60, days, barnard, s, second, patient, philip, blaiberg, lived, for, 19, months, it, was, the, advent, of, cyclosporine, that, altered, transplants, from, research, surgery, to, life, saving, treatment, in, 1968, surgical, pioneer, denton, cooley, performed, 17, transplants, including, the, first, heart, lung, transplant, fourteen, of, his, patients, were, dead, within, six, months, by, 1984, two, thirds, of, all, heart, transplant, patients, survived, for, five, years, or, more, with, organ, transplants, becoming, commonplace, limited, only, by, donors, surgeons, moved, on, to, riskier, fields, including, multiple, organ, transplants, on, humans, and, whole, body, transplant, research, on, animals, on, 9, march, 1981, the, first, successful, heart, lung, transplant, took, place, at, stanford, university, hospital, the, head, surgeon, bruce, reitz, credited, the, patient, s, recovery, to, cyclosporine, as, the, rising, success, rate, of, transplants, and, modern, immunosuppression, make, transplants, more, common, the, need, for, more, organs, has, become, critical, transplants, from, living, donors, especially, relatives, have, become, increasingly, common, additionally, there, is, substantive, research, into, xenotransplantation, or, transgenic, organs, although, these, forms, of, transplant, are, not, yet, being, used, in, humans, clinical, trials, involving, the, use, of, specific, cell, types, have, been, conducted, with, promising, results, such, as, using, porcine, islets, of, langerhans, to, treat, type, 1, diabetes, however, there, are, still, many, problems, that, would, need, to, be, solved, before, they, would, be, feasible, options, in, people, requiring, transplants, recently, researchers, have, been, looking, into, means, of, reducing, the, general, burden, of, immunosuppression, common, approaches, include, avoidance, of, steroids, reduced, exposure, to, calcineurin, inhibitors, and, other, means, of, weaning, drugs, based, on, patient, outcome, and, function, while, short, term, outcomes, appear, promising, long, term, outcomes, are, still, unknown, and, in, general, reduced, immunosuppression, increases, the, risk, of, rejection, and, decreases, the, risk, of, infection, the, risk, of, early, rejection, is, increased, if, corticosteroid, immunosuppression, are, avoided, or, withdrawn, after, renal, transplantation, many, other, new, drugs, are, under, development, for, transplantation, the, emerging, field, of, regenerative, medicine, promises, to, solve, the, problem, of, organ, transplant, rejection, by, regrowing, organs, in, the, lab, using, person, s, own, cells, stem, cells, or, healthy, cells, extracted, from, the, donor, site, since, 2000, there, have, been, approximately, 2, 200, lung, transplants, performed, each, year, worldwide, from, 2000, to, 2006, the, median, survival, period, for, lung, transplant, patients, has, been, 5, 5, years, in, china, a, kidney, transplant, operation, runs, for, around, 70, 000, liver, for, 160, 000, and, heart, for, 120, 000, in, the, united, states, tissue, transplants, are, regulated, by, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, which, sets, strict, regulations, on, the, safety, of, the, transplants, primarily, aimed, at, the, prevention, of, the, spread, of, communicable, disease, regulations, include, criteria, for, donor, screening, and, testing, as, well, as, strict, regulations, on, the, processing, and, distribution, of, tissue, grafts, organ, transplants, are, not, regulated, by, the, fda, it, is, essential, that, the, hla, complexes, of, both, the, donor, and, recipient, be, as, closely, matched, as, possible, to, prevent, graft, rejection, in, november, 2007, the, cdc, reported, the, first, ever, case, of, hiv, and, hepatitis, c, being, simultaneously, transferred, through, an, organ, transplant, the, donor, was, a, 38, year, old, male, considered, high, risk, by, donation, organizations, and, his, organs, transmitted, hiv, and, hepatitis, c, to, four, organ, recipients, experts, say, that, the, reason, the, diseases, did, not, show, up, on, screening, tests, is, probably, because, they, were, contracted, within, three, weeks, before, the, donor, s, death, so, antibodies, would, not, have, existed, in, high, enough, numbers, to, detect, the, crisis, has, caused, many, to, call, for, more, sensitive, screening, tests, which, could, pick, up, antibodies, sooner, currently, the, screens, cannot, detect, the, small, number, of, antibodies, produced, in, hiv, infections, within, the, last, 90, days, or, hepatitis, c, infections, within, the, last, 18, 21, days, before, a, donation, is, made, nucleic, acid, testing, is, now, being, done, by, many, organ, procurement, organizations, and, is, able, to, detect, hiv, and, hepatitis, c, directly, within, seven, to, ten, days, of, exposure, to, the, virus, both, developing, and, developed, countries, have, forged, various, policies, to, try, to, increase, the, safety, and, availability, of, organ, transplants, to, their, citizens, however, whilst, potential, recipients, in, developing, countries, may, mirror, their, more, developed, counterparts, in, desperation, potential, donors, in, developing, countries, do, not, the, indian, government, has, had, difficulty, tracking, the, flourishing, organ, black, market, in, their, country, but, in, recent, times, it, has, amended, its, organ, transplant, law, to, make, punishment, more, stringent, for, commercial, dealings, in, organs, it, has, also, included, new, clauses, in, the, law, to, support, deceased, organ, donation, such, as, making, it, mandatory, to, request, for, organ, donation, in, case, of, brain, death, other, countries, victimized, by, illegal, organ, trade, have, also, implemented, legislative, reactions, moldova, has, made, international, adoption, illegal, in, fear, of, organ, traffickers, china, has, made, selling, of, organs, illegal, as, of, july, 2006, and, claims, that, all, prisoner, organ, donors, have, filed, consent, however, doctors, in, other, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, have, accused, china, of, abusing, its, high, capital, punishment, rate, despite, these, efforts, illegal, organ, trafficking, continues, to, thrive, and, can, be, attributed, to, corruption, in, healthcare, systems, which, has, been, traced, as, high, up, as, the, doctors, themselves, in, china, and, ukraine, and, the, blind, eye, economically, strained, governments, and, health, care, programs, must, sometimes, turn, to, organ, trafficking, some, organs, are, also, shipped, to, uganda, and, the, netherlands, this, was, a, main, product, in, the, triangular, trade, in, 1934, starting, on, 1, may, 2007, doctors, involved, in, commercial, trade, of, organs, will, face, fines, and, suspensions, in, china, only, a, few, certified, hospitals, will, be, allowed, to, perform, organ, transplants, in, order, to, curb, illegal, transplants, harvesting, organs, without, donor, s, consent, was, also, deemed, a, crime, on, 27, june, 2008, indonesian, sulaiman, damanik, 26, pleaded, guilty, in, singapore, court, for, sale, of, his, kidney,

is, banned, in, singapore, and, in, many, other, countries, to, prevent, the, exploitation, of, poor, and, socially, disadvantaged, donors, who, are, unable, to, make, informed, choices, and, suffer, potential, medical, risks, toni, 27, the, other, accused, donated, a, kidney, to, an, indonesian, patient, in, march, alleging, he, was, the, patient, s, adopted, son, and, was, paid, 186, million, rupiah, us, 20, 200, upon, sentence, both, would, suffer, each, 12, months, in, jail, or, 10, 000, singapore, dollars, us, 7, 600, fine, in, an, article, appearing, in, the, april, 2004, issue, of, econ, journal, watch, economist, alex, tabarrok, examined, the, impact, of, direct, consent, laws, on, transplant, organ, availability, tabarrok, found, that, social, pressures, resisting, the, use, of, transplant, organs, decreased, over, time, as, the, opportunity, of, individual, decisions, increased, tabarrok, concluded, his, study, suggesting, that, gradual, elimination, of, organ, donation, restrictions, and, move, to, a, free, market, in, organ, sales, will, increase, supply, of, organs, and, encourage, broader, social, acceptance, of, organ, donation, as, a, practice, in, the, united, states, 24, states, have, no, law, preventing, discrimination, against, potential, organ, recipients, based, on, cognitive, ability, including, children, a, 2008, study, found, that, of, the, transplant, centers, surveyed, in, those, states, 85, percent, considered, disability, when, deciding, transplant, list, and, forty, four, percent, would, deny, an, organ, transplant, to, a, child, with, a, neurodevelopmental, disability, the, existence, and, distribution, of, organ, transplantation, procedures, in, developing, countries, while, almost, always, beneficial, to, those, receiving, them, raise, many, ethical, concerns, both, the, source, and, method, of, obtaining, the, organ, to, transplant, are, major, ethical, issues, to, consider, as, well, as, the, notion, of, distributive, justice, the, world, health, organization, argues, that, transplantations, promote, health, but, the, notion, of, transplantation, tourism, has, the, potential, to, violate, human, rights, or, exploit, the, poor, to, have, unintended, health, consequences, and, to, provide, unequal, access, to, services, all, of, which, ultimately, may, cause, harm, regardless, of, the, gift, of, life, in, the, context, of, developing, countries, this, might, be, coercive, the, practice, of, coercion, could, be, considered, exploitative, of, the, poor, population, violating, basic, human, rights, according, to, articles, 3, and, 4, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, there, is, also, a, powerful, opposing, view, that, trade, in, organs, if, properly, and, effectively, regulated, to, ensure, that, the, seller, is, fully, informed, of, all, the, consequences, of, donation, is, a, mutually, beneficial, transaction, between, two, consenting, adults, and, that, prohibiting, it, would, itself, be, a, violation, of, articles, 3, and, 29, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, even, within, developed, countries, there, is, concern, that, enthusiasm, for, increasing, the, supply, of, organs, may, trample, on, respect, for, the, right, to, life, the, question, is, made, even, more, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, irreversibility, criterion, for, legal, death, cannot, be, adequately, defined, and, can, easily, change, with, changing, technology, surgeons, notably, paolo, macchiarini, in, sweden, performed, the, first, implantation, of, a, synthetic, trachea, in, july, 2011, for, a, 36, year, old, patient, who, had, cancer, stem, cells, taken, from, the, patient, s, hip, were, treated, with, growth, factors, and, incubated, on, a, plastic, replica, of, his, natural, trachea, according, to, information, uncovered, by, the, swedish, documentary, dokument, inifr, n, experimenten, swedish, documents, from, the, inside, the, experiments, the, patient, andemariam, went, on, to, develop, an, increasingly, terrible, and, eventually, bloody, cough, to, dying, incubated, in, the, hospital, at, that, point, determined, by, autopsy, 90, of, the, synthetic, windpipe, had, come, loose, he, allegedly, made, several, trips, to, see, macchiarini, for, his, complications, and, at, one, point, had, surgery, again, to, have, his, synthetic, windpipe, replaced, but, macchiarini, was, notoriously, difficult, to, get, an, appointment, with, according, to, the, autopsy, the, old, synthetic, windpipe, did, not, appear, to, have, been, replaced, macchiarini, s, academic, credentials, have, been, called, into, question, and, he, has, recently, been, accused, of, alleged, research, misconduct, left, ventricular, assist, devices, are, often, used, as, a, bridge, to, provide, additional, time, while, a, patient, waits, for, a, transplant, for, example, former, us, vice, president, dick, cheney, had, such, a, device, implanted, in, 2010, and, then, 20, months, later, received, a, heart, transplant, in, 2012, in, year, 2012, about, 3, 000, ventricular, assist, devices, were, inserted, in, the, united, states, as, compared, to, approximately, 2, 500, heart, transplants, the, use, of, airbags, in, cars, as, well, as, greater, use, of, helmets, by, bicyclists, and, skiers, has, reduced, the, number, of, persons, with, fatal, head, injuries, which, is, a, common, source, of, donors, hearts, an, early, stage, medical, laboratory, and, research, company, called, organovo, designs, and, develops, functional, three, dimensional, human, tissue, for, medical, research, and, therapeutic, applications, the, company, utilizes, its, novogen, mmx, bioprinter, for, 3d, bioprinting, organovo, anticipates, that, the, bioprinting, of, human, tissues, will, accelerate, the, preclinical, drug, testing, and, discovery, process, enabling, treatments, to, be, created, more, quickly, and, at, lower, cost, additionally, organovo, has, long, term, expectations, that, this, technology, could, be, suitable, for, surgical, therapy, and, transplantation, a, further, area, of, active, research, is, concerned, with, improving, and, assessing, organs, during, their, preservation, various, techniques, have, emerged, which, show, great, promise, most, of, which, involve, perfusing, the, organ, under, either, hypothermic, 4, 10, c, or, normothermic, 37, c, conditions, all, of, these, add, additional, cost, and, logistical, complexity, to, the, organ, retrieval, preservation, and, transplant, process, but, early, results, suggest, it, may, well, be, worth, it, hypothermic, perfusion, is, in, clinical, use, for, transplantation, of, kidneys, and, liver, whilst, normothermic, perfusion, has, been, used, effectively, in, the, heart, lung, liver, and, less, so, in, the, kidney, another, area, of, research, being, explored, is, the, use, of, genetically, engineered, animals, for, transplants, similar, to, human, organ, donors, scientists, have, developed, a, genetically, engineered, pig, with, the, aim, of, reducing, rejection, to, pig, organs, by, human, patients, this, is, currently, at, the, basic, research, stage, but, shows, great, promise, in, alleviating, the, long, waiting, lists, for, organ, transplants, and, the, number, of, people, in, need, of, transplants, outweighs, the, amount, of, organs, donated, trials, are, being, done, to, prevent, the, pig, organ, transplant, to, enter, a, clinical, trial, phase, until, the, potential, disease, transfer, from, pigs, to, humans, can, be, safely, and, satisfactorily, managed, isola, gordon, 1991
