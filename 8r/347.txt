pteriomorphia, marine, mussels, palaeoheterodonta, freshwater, mussels, heterodonta, zebra, mussels, mussel, m, s, l, is, the, common, name, used, for, members, of, several, families, of, bivalve, molluscs, from, saltwater, and, freshwater, habitats, these, groups, have, in, common, a, shell, whose, outline, is, elongated, and, asymmetrical, compared, with, other, edible, clams, which, are, often, more, or, less, rounded, or, oval, the, word, mussel, is, frequently, used, to, mean, the, bivalves, of, the, marine, family, mytilidae, most, of, which, live, on, exposed, shores, in, the, intertidal, zone, attached, by, means, of, their, strong, byssal, threads, beard, to, a, firm, substrate, a, few, species, in, the, genus, bathymodiolus, have, colonised, hydrothermal, vents, associated, with, deep, ocean, ridges, in, most, marine, mussels, the, shell, is, longer, than, it, is, wide, being, wedge, shaped, or, asymmetrical, the, external, colour, of, the, shell, is, often, dark, blue, blackish, or, brown, while, the, interior, is, silvery, and, somewhat, nacreous, the, common, name, mussel, is, also, used, for, many, freshwater, bivalves, including, the, freshwater, pearl, mussels, freshwater, mussel, species, inhabit, lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, canals, and, they, are, classified, in, a, different, subclass, of, bivalves, despite, some, very, superficial, similarities, in, appearance, freshwater, zebra, mussels, and, their, relatives, in, the, family, dreissenidae, are, not, related, to, previously, mentioned, groups, even, though, they, resemble, many, mytilus, species, in, shape, and, live, attached, to, rocks, and, other, hard, surfaces, in, a, similar, manner, using, a, byssus, they, are, classified, with, the, heterodonta, the, taxonomic, group, which, includes, most, of, the, bivalves, commonly, referred, to, as, clams, the, mussel, s, external, shell, is, composed, of, two, hinged, halves, or, valves, the, valves, are, joined, on, the, outside, by, a, ligament, and, are, closed, when, necessary, by, strong, internal, muscles, anterior, and, posterior, adductor, muscles, mussel, shells, carry, out, a, variety, of, functions, including, support, for, soft, tissues, protection, from, predators, and, protection, against, desiccation, the, shell, has, three, layers, in, the, pearly, mussels, there, is, an, inner, iridescent, layer, of, nacre, mother, of, pearl, composed, of, calcium, carbonate, which, is, continuously, secreted, by, the, mantle, the, prismatic, layer, a, middle, layer, of, chalky, white, crystals, of, calcium, carbonate, in, a, protein, matrix, and, the, periostracum, an, outer, pigmented, layer, resembling, a, skin, the, periostracum, is, composed, of, a, protein, called, conchin, and, its, function, is, to, protect, the, prismatic, layer, from, abrasion, and, dissolution, by, acids, especially, important, in, freshwater, forms, where, the, decay, of, leaf, materials, produces, acids, like, most, bivalves, mussels, have, a, large, organ, called, a, foot, in, freshwater, mussels, the, foot, is, large, muscular, and, generally, hatchet, shaped, it, is, used, to, pull, the, animal, through, the, substrate, typically, sand, gravel, or, silt, in, which, it, lies, partially, buried, it, does, this, by, repeatedly, advancing, the, foot, through, the, substrate, expanding, the, end, so, it, serves, as, an, anchor, and, then, pulling, the, rest, of, the, animal, with, its, shell, forward, it, also, serves, as, a, fleshy, anchor, when, the, animal, is, stationary, in, marine, mussels, the, foot, is, smaller, tongue, like, in, shape, with, a, groove, on, the, ventral, surface, which, is, continuous, with, the, byssus, pit, in, this, pit, a, viscous, secretion, is, exuded, entering, the, groove, and, hardening, gradually, upon, contact, with, sea, water, this, forms, extremely, tough, strong, elastic, byssal, threads, that, secure, the, mussel, to, its, substrate, allowing, it, to, remain, sessile, in, areas, of, high, flow, the, byssal, thread, is, also, sometimes, used, by, mussels, as, a, defensive, measure, to, tether, predatory, molluscs, such, as, dog, whelks, that, invade, mussel, beds, immobilising, them, and, thus, starving, them, to, death, in, cooking, the, byssus, of, the, mussel, is, known, as, the, beard, and, is, removed, during, preparation, often, after, cooking, when, the, mussel, has, opened, both, marine, and, freshwater, mussels, are, filter, feeders, they, feed, on, plankton, and, other, microscopic, sea, creatures, which, are, free, floating, in, seawater, a, mussel, draws, water, in, through, its, incurrent, siphon, the, water, is, then, brought, into, the, branchial, chamber, by, the, actions, of, the, cilia, located, on, the, gills, for, ciliary, mucus, feeding, the, wastewater, exits, through, the, excurrent, siphon, the, labial, palps, finally, funnel, the, food, into, the, mouth, where, digestion, begins, marine, mussels, are, usually, found, clumping, together, on, wave, washed, rocks, each, attached, to, the, rock, by, its, byssus, the, clumping, habit, helps, hold, the, mussels, firm, against, the, force, of, the, waves, at, low, tide, mussels, in, the, middle, of, a, clump, will, undergo, less, water, loss, because, of, water, capture, by, the, other, mussels, both, marine, and, freshwater, mussels, are, gonochoristic, with, separate, male, and, female, individuals, in, marine, mussels, fertilization, occurs, outside, the, body, with, a, larval, stage, that, drifts, for, three, weeks, to, six, months, before, settling, on, a, hard, surface, as, a, young, mussel, there, it, is, capable, of, moving, slowly, by, means, of, attaching, and, detaching, byssal, threads, to, attain, a, better, life, position, freshwater, mussels, reproduce, sexually, sperm, is, released, by, the, male, directly, into, the, water, and, enters, the, female, via, the, incurrent, siphon, after, fertilization, the, eggs, develop, into, a, larval, stage, called, a, glochidium, plural, glochidia, which, temporarily, parasitizes, fish, attaching, themselves, to, the, fish, s, fins, or, gills, prior, to, their, release, the, glochidia, grow, in, the, gills, of, the, female, mussel, where, they, are, constantly, flushed, with, oxygen, rich, water, in, some, species, release, occurs, when, a, fish, attempts, to, attack, the, mussel, s, mantle, flaps, which, are, shaped, like, minnows, or, other, prey, an, example, of, aggressive, mimicry, glochidia, are, generally, species, specific, and, will, only, live, if, they, find, the, correct, fish, host, once, the, larval, mussels, attach, to, the, fish, the, fish, body, reacts, to, cover, them, with, cells, forming, a, cyst, where, the, glochidia, remain, for, two, to, five, weeks, depending, on, temperature, they, grow, break, free, from, the, host, and, drop, to, the, bottom, of, the, water, to, begin, an, independent, life, marine, mussels, are, eaten, by, humans, starfish, seabirds, and, by, numerous, species, of, predatory, marine, gastropods, in, the, family, muricidae, such, as, the, dog, whelk, nucella, lapillus, freshwater, mussels, are, eaten, by, muskrats, otters, raccoons, ducks, baboons, humans, and, geese, marine, mussels, are, abundant, in, the, low, and, mid, intertidal, zone, in, temperate, seas, globally, other, species, of, marine, mussel, live, in, tropical, intertidal, areas, but, not, in, the, same, huge, numbers, as, in, temperate, zones, certain, species, of, marine, mussels, prefer, salt, marshes, or, quiet, bays, while, others, thrive, in, pounding, surf, completely, covering, wave, washed, rocks, some, species, have, colonized, abyssal, depths, near, hydrothermal, vents, the, south, african, white, mussel, exceptionally, does, not, bind, itself, to, rocks, but, burrows, into, sandy, beaches, extending, two, tubes, above, the, sand, surface, for, ingestion, of, food, and, water, and, exhausting, wastes, freshwater, mussels, inhabit, permanent, lakes, rivers, canals, and, streams, throughout, the, world, except, in, the, polar, regions, they, require, a, constant, source, of, cool, clean, water, they, prefer, water, with, a, substantial, mineral, content, using, calcium, carbonate, to, build, their, shells, in, 2005, china, accounted, for, 40, of, the, global, mussel, catch, according, to, a, fao, study, within, europe, where, mussels, have, been, cultivated, for, centuries, spain, remained, the, industry, leader, aquaculture, of, mussels, in, north, america, began, in, the, 1970s, in, the, us, the, northeast, and, northwest, have, significant, mussel, aquaculture, operations, where, mytilus, edulis, blue, mussel, is, most, commonly, grown, while, the, mussel, industry, in, the, us, has, increased, in, north, america, 80, of, cultured, mussels, are, produced, in, prince, edward, island, in, canada, in, washington, state, an, estimated, 2, 9, million, pounds, of, mussels, were, harvested, in, 2010, valued, at, roughly, 4, 3m, in, new, zealand, perna, canaliculus, the, new, zealand, green, lipped, mussel, industry, produces, over, 140, 000, metric, tons, 150, 000, short, tons, annually, and, in, 2009, was, valued, in, excess, of, nz, 250, million, freshwater, mussels, are, used, as, host, animals, for, the, cultivation, of, freshwater, pearls, some, species, of, marine, mussel, including, the, blue, mussel, mytilus, edulis, and, the, new, zealand, green, lipped, mussel, perna, canaliculus, are, also, cultivated, as, a, source, of, food, in, some, areas, of, the, world, mussel, farmers, collect, naturally, occurring, marine, mussel, seed, for, transfer, to, more, appropriate, growing, areas, however, most, north, american, mussel, farmers, rely, on, hatchery, produced, seed, growers, typically, purchase, seed, after, it, has, set, about, 1mm, in, size, or, after, it, has, been, nursed, in, upwellers, for, 3, 6, additional, weeks, and, is, 2, 3mm, the, seed, is, then, typically, reared, in, a, nursery, environment, where, it, is, transferred, to, a, material, with, a, suitable, surface, for, later, relocation, to, the, growing, area, after, about, three, months, in, the, nursery, mussel, seed, is, socked, placed, in, a, tube, like, mesh, material, and, hung, on, longlines, or, rafts, for, grow, out, within, a, few, days, the, mussels, migrate, to, the, outside, of, the, sock, for, better, access, food, sources, in, the, water, column, mussels, grow, quickly, and, are, usually, ready, for, harvest, in, less, than, two, years, unlike, other, cultured, bivalves, mussels, use, byssus, threads, beard, to, attach, themselves, to, any, firm, substrate, which, makes, them, suitable, for, a, number, of, culture, methods, there, are, a, variety, of, techniques, for, growing, mussels, in, roughly, 12, 15, months, mussels, reach, marketable, size, 40mm, and, are, ready, for, harvest, harvesting, methods, depend, on, the, grow, out, area, and, the, rearing, method, being, used, dredges, are, currently, used, for, on, bottom, culture, mussels, grown, on, wooden, poles, can, be, harvested, by, hand, or, with, a, hydraulic, powered, system, for, raft, and, longline, culture, a, platform, is, typically, lowered, under, the, mussel, lines, which, are, then, cut, from, the, system, and, brought, to, the, surface, and, dumped, into, containers, on, a, nearby, vessel, after, harvest, mussels, are, typically, placed, in, seawater, tanks, to, rid, them, of, impurities, before, marketing, byssal, threads, used, to, anchor, mussels, to, substrates, are, now, recognized, as, superior, bonding, agents, a, number, of, studies, have, investigated, mussel, glues, for, industrial, and, surgical, applications, further, mussel, adhesive, proteins, inspired, the, design, of, peptide, mimics, that, were, well, studied, for, surface, bioengineering, of, medical, implants, self, assembling, mussel, inspired, peptides, were, also, shown, to, form, functional, nanostructures, also, a, peptide, derived, from, mussel, foot, protein, 5, a, key, protein, in, mussel, adhesion, displayed, antibacterial, properties, and, served, as, inspiration, for, the, design, of, a, new, class, of, peptide, based, antibacterial, adhesive, hydrogels, which, are, active, against, drug, resistant, gram, positive, bacteria, additionally, byssal, threads, have, provided, insight, into, the, construction, of, artificial, tendons, mussels, are, widely, used, as, bio, indicators, to, monitor, the, health, of, aquatic, environments, in, both, fresh, water, and, the, marine, environments, they, are, particularly, useful, since, they, are, distributed, worldwide, and, they, are, sessile, these, characteristics, ensure, that, they, are, representative, of, the, environment, where, they, are, sampled, or, placed, their, population, status, or, structure, physiology, behaviour, or, the, level, of, contamination, with, elements, or, compounds, can, indicate, the, status, of, the, ecosystem, transplanted, caged, mussel, were, used, in, a, study, to, monitor, heavy, metal, contamination, in, coastal, waters, marine, nutrient, bioextraction, is, the, practice, of, farming, and, harvesting, marine, organisms, such, as, shellfish, and, seaweed, for, the, purpose, of, reducing, nutrient, pollution, mussels, and, other, bivalve, shellfish, consume, phytoplankton, containing, nutrients, such, as, nitrogen, n, and, phosphorus, p, on, average, one, live, mussel, is, 1, 0, n, and, 0, 1, p, when, the, mussels, are, harvested, and, removed, these, nutrients, are, also, removed, from, the, system, and, recycled, in, the, form, of, seafood, or, mussel, biomass, which, can, be, used, as, an, organic, fertilizer, or, animal, feed, additive, these, ecosystem, services, provided, by, mussels, are, of, particular, interest, to, those, hoping, to, mitigate, excess, anthropogenic, marine, nutrients, particularly, in, eutrophic, marine, systems, while, mussel, aquaculture, is, actually, promoted, in, some, countries, such, as, sweden, as, a, water, management, strategy, to, address, coastal, eutrophication, mussel, farming, as, a, nutrient, mitigation, tool, is, still, in, its, infancy, in, most, parts, of, the, world, ongoing, efforts, in, the, baltic, sea, denmark, sweden, germany, poland, and, long, island, sound, and, puget, sound, in, the, u, s, are, currently, examining, nutrient, uptake, cost, effectiveness, and, potential, environmental, impacts, of, mussel, farming, as, a, means, to, mitigate, excess, nutrients, and, complement, traditional, wastewater, treatment, programs, out, of, 511, species, assessed, globally, 44, of, freshwater, mussels, listed, on, the, iucn, red, list, are, classified, at, some, level, of, threatened, there, are, 297, known, freshwater, mussel, taxa, in, the, united, states, and, canada, which, are, home, to, the, most, diverse, freshwater, mussel, fauna, in, the, world, especially, in, the, southeastern, united, states, of, the, 297, known, species, 213, 71, 7, taxa, are, listed, as, endangered, threatened, or, of, special, concern, approximately, 37, north, american, species, were, considered, extinct, in, 2004, out, of, 16, recognized, freshwater, mussel, species, in, europe, 12, are, considered, threatened, with, varying, statuses, from, near, threatened, to, critically, endangered, 8, species, are, protected, by, the, european, union, habitats, directive, across, all, annexes, there, are, approximately, 85, known, species, in, africa, 102, in, central, america, 74, in, south, america, 228, in, asia, with, the, highest, species, diversity, in, southeast, asia, and, 33, in, australasia, the, species, in, these, areas, are, not, as, well, researched, as, in, north, america, and, europe, approximately, 61, of, freshwater, mussels, in, asia, had, not, been, assessed, and, conservation, efforts, were, almost, non, existent, no, asian, mussels, were, protected, internationally, under, legislation, such, as, cites, the, main, factors, contributing, to, the, decline, of, freshwater, mussels, include, destruction, by, dams, increased, siltation, channel, alteration, and, the, introduction, of, invasive, species, such, as, the, zebra, mussel, humans, have, used, mussels, as, food, for, thousands, of, years, about, 17, species, are, edible, of, which, the, most, commonly, eaten, are, mytilus, edulis, m, galloprovincialis, m, trossulus, and, perna, canaliculus, although, freshwater, mussels, are, edible, today, they, are, widely, considered, unpalatable, and, are, rarely, consumed, freshwater, mussels, were, once, eaten, extensively, by, native, peoples, of, north, america, and, some, still, do, today, in, the, united, states, during, the, second, world, war, mussels, were, commonly, served, in, diners, and, restaurants, across, the, country, this, was, due, to, wartime, rationing, and, shortages, of, red, meat, such, as, beef, and, pork, mussels, became, a, popular, substitute, for, most, meats, with, the, exception, of, poultry, in, belgium, the, netherlands, and, france, mussels, are, consumed, with, french, fries, mosselen, met, friet, or, moules, frites, or, bread, in, belgium, mussels, are, sometimes, served, with, fresh, herbs, and, flavorful, vegetables, in, a, stock, of, butter, and, white, wine, fries, and, belgian, beer, sometimes, are, accompaniments, a, similar, style, of, preparation, is, commonly, found, in, the, rhineland, where, mussels, are, customarily, served, in, restaurants, with, a, side, of, dark, bread, in, months, containing, an, r, that, is, between, september, and, april, in, the, netherlands, mussels, are, sometimes, served, fried, in, batter, or, breadcrumbs, particularly, at, take, out, food, outlets, or, informal, settings, in, france, the, clade, des, moules, or, locally, terr, de, moules, is, a, mussel, bake, that, can, be, found, along, the, beaches, of, the, bay, of, biscay, in, italy, mussels, are, mixed, with, other, seafood, they, are, most, commonly, eaten, steamed, sometimes, with, white, wine, herbs, and, served, with, the, remaining, water, and, some, lemon, in, spain, they, are, consumed, mostly, steamed, sometimes, boiling, white, wine, onion, and, herbs, and, served, with, the, remaining, water, and, some, lemon, they, can, also, be, eaten, as, tigres, a, sort, of, croquette, using, the, mussel, meat, shrimps, and, other, pieces, of, fish, in, a, thick, bechamel, then, breaded, and, fried, in, the, clean, mussel, shell, they, are, used, in, other, sort, of, dishes, such, as, rices, or, soups, or, commonly, eaten, canned, in, a, pickling, brine, made, of, oil, vinegar, peppercorns, bay, leaves, and, paprika, in, turkey, mussels, are, either, covered, with, flour, and, fried, on, skewers, midye, tava, or, filled, with, rice, and, served, cold, midye, dolma, and, are, usually, consumed, after, alcohol, mostly, raki, or, beer, they, are, used, in, ireland, boiled, and, seasoned, with, vinegar, with, the, bray, or, boiling, water, as, a, supplementary, hot, drink, in, cantonese, cuisine, mussels, are, cooked, in, a, broth, of, garlic, and, fermented, black, bean, in, new, zealand, they, are, served, in, a, chilli, or, garlic, based, vinaigrette, processed, into, fritters, and, fried, or, used, as, the, base, for, a, chowder, in, brazil, it, is, common, to, see, mussels, being, cooked, and, served, with, olive, oil, usually, accompanied, by, onion, garlic, and, other, herbs, the, plate, is, very, popular, among, tourists, and, low, classes, probably, because, of, the, hot, climate, that, favours, mussels, reproduction, in, india, mussels, are, popular, in, kerala, maharashtra, karnataka, bhatkal, and, goa, they, are, either, prepared, with, drumsticks, breadfruit, or, other, vegetables, or, filled, with, rice, and, coconut, paste, with, spices, and, served, hot, fried, mussels, kadukka, in, malayalam, of, north, kerala, especially, in, thalassery, are, a, spicy, favored, delicacy, in, coastal, karnataka, bearys, prepare, special, rice, balls, stuffed, with, spicy, fried, mussels, and, steamed, locally, known, as, pachilede, pindi, mussels, can, be, smoked, boiled, steamed, roasted, barbecued, or, fried, in, butter, or, vegetable, oil, they, can, be, used, in, soups, salads, and, sauces, as, with, all, shellfish, except, shrimp, mussels, should, be, checked, to, ensure, they, are, still, alive, just, before, they, are, cooked, enzymes, quickly, break, down, the, meat, and, make, them, unpalatable, or, poisonous, after, dying, or, uncooked, some, mussels, might, contain, toxins, a, simple, criterion, is, that, live, mussels, when, in, the, air, will, shut, tightly, when, disturbed, open, unresponsive, mussels, are, dead, and, must, be, discarded, unusually, heavy, wild, caught, closed, mussels, may, be, discarded, as, they, may, contain, only, mud, or, sand, they, can, be, tested, by, slightly, opening, the, shell, halves, a, thorough, rinse, in, water, and, removal, of, the, beard, is, suggested, mussel, shells, usually, open, when, cooked, revealing, the, cooked, soft, parts, historically, it, has, been, believed, that, after, cooking, all, the, mussels, should, have, opened, and, those, that, have, not, are, not, safe, to, eat, and, should, be, discarded, however, according, to, marine, biologist, nick, ruello, this, advice, may, have, arisen, from, an, old, poorly, researched, cookbook, s, advice, which, has, now, become, an, assumed, truism, for, all, shellfish, ruello, found, 11, 5, of, all, mussels, failed, to, open, during, cooking, but, when, forced, open, 100, were, both, adequately, cooked, and, safe, to, eat, although, mussels, are, valued, as, food, mussel, poisoning, due, to, toxic, planktonic, organisms, can, be, a, danger, along, some, coastlines, for, instance, mussels, should, be, avoided, during, the, warmer, months, along, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, this, poisoning, is, usually, due, to, a, bloom, of, dinoflagellates, red, tides, which, contain, toxins, the, dinoflagellates, and, their, toxin, are, harmless, to, mussels, even, when, concentrated, by, the, mussel, s, filter, feeding, but, the, concentrated, toxins, cause, serious, illness, if, the, mussels, are, consumed, by, humans, including, paralytic, shellfish, poisoning, foods, that, are, an, excellent, source, of, a, particular, nutrient, provide, 20, or, more, of, the, recommended, daily, value, foods, that, are, a, good, source, of, a, particular, nutrient, provide, between, 10, and, 20, of, the, recommended, daily, value
