biology, is, the, scientific, study, of, life, it, is, a, natural, science, with, a, broad, scope, but, has, several, unifying, themes, that, tie, it, together, as, a, single, coherent, field, for, instance, all, organisms, are, made, up, of, cells, that, process, hereditary, information, encoded, in, genes, which, can, be, transmitted, to, future, generations, another, major, theme, is, evolution, which, explains, the, unity, and, diversity, of, life, energy, processing, is, also, important, to, life, as, it, allows, organisms, to, move, grow, and, reproduce, finally, all, organisms, are, able, to, regulate, their, own, internal, environments, biologists, are, able, to, study, life, at, multiple, levels, of, organization, from, the, molecular, biology, of, a, cell, to, the, anatomy, and, physiology, of, plants, and, animals, and, evolution, of, populations, hence, there, are, multiple, subdisciplines, within, biology, each, defined, by, the, nature, of, their, research, questions, and, the, tools, that, they, use, like, other, scientists, biologists, use, the, scientific, method, to, make, observations, pose, questions, generate, hypotheses, perform, experiments, and, form, conclusions, about, the, world, around, them, life, on, earth, which, emerged, more, than, 3, 7, billion, years, ago, is, immensely, diverse, biologists, have, sought, to, study, and, classify, the, various, forms, of, life, from, prokaryotic, organisms, such, as, archaea, and, bacteria, to, eukaryotic, organisms, such, as, protists, fungi, plants, and, animals, these, various, organisms, contribute, to, the, biodiversity, of, an, ecosystem, where, they, play, specialized, roles, in, the, cycling, of, nutrients, and, energy, through, their, biophysical, environment, the, earliest, of, roots, of, science, which, included, medicine, can, be, traced, to, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, in, around, 3000, to, 1200, bce, their, contributions, shaped, ancient, greek, natural, philosophy, ancient, greek, philosophers, such, as, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, contributed, extensively, to, the, development, of, biological, knowledge, he, explored, biological, causation, and, the, diversity, of, life, his, successor, theophrastus, began, the, scientific, study, of, plants, scholars, of, the, medieval, islamic, world, who, wrote, on, biology, included, al, jahiz, 781, 869, al, d, nawar, 828, 896, who, wrote, on, botany, and, rhazes, 865, 925, who, wrote, on, anatomy, and, physiology, medicine, was, especially, well, studied, by, islamic, scholars, working, in, greek, philosopher, traditions, while, natural, history, drew, heavily, on, aristotelian, thought, biology, began, to, quickly, develop, with, anton, van, leeuwenhoek, s, dramatic, improvement, of, the, microscope, it, was, then, that, scholars, discovered, spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria, and, the, diversity, of, microscopic, life, investigations, by, jan, swammerdam, led, to, new, interest, in, entomology, and, helped, to, develop, techniques, of, microscopic, dissection, and, staining, advances, in, microscopy, had, a, profound, impact, on, biological, thinking, in, the, early, 19th, century, biologists, pointed, to, the, central, importance, of, the, cell, in, 1838, schleiden, and, schwann, began, promoting, the, now, universal, ideas, that, 1, the, basic, unit, of, organisms, is, the, cell, and, 2, that, individual, cells, have, all, the, characteristics, of, life, although, they, opposed, the, idea, that, 3, all, cells, come, from, the, division, of, other, cells, continuing, to, support, spontaneous, generation, however, robert, remak, and, rudolf, virchow, were, able, to, reify, the, third, tenet, and, by, the, 1860s, most, biologists, accepted, all, three, tenets, which, consolidated, into, cell, theory, meanwhile, taxonomy, and, classification, became, the, focus, of, natural, historians, carl, linnaeus, published, a, basic, taxonomy, for, the, natural, world, in, 1735, and, in, the, 1750s, introduced, scientific, names, for, all, his, species, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, treated, species, as, artificial, categories, and, living, forms, as, malleable, even, suggesting, the, possibility, of, common, descent, serious, evolutionary, thinking, originated, with, the, works, of, jean, baptiste, lamarck, who, presented, a, coherent, theory, of, evolution, the, british, naturalist, charles, darwin, combining, the, biogeographical, approach, of, humboldt, the, uniformitarian, geology, of, lyell, malthus, s, writings, on, population, growth, and, his, own, morphological, expertise, and, extensive, natural, observations, forged, a, more, successful, evolutionary, theory, based, on, natural, selection, similar, reasoning, and, evidence, led, alfred, russel, wallace, to, independently, reach, the, same, conclusions, the, basis, for, modern, genetics, began, with, the, work, of, gregor, mendel, in, 1865, this, outlined, the, principles, of, biological, inheritance, however, the, significance, of, his, work, was, not, realized, until, the, early, 20th, century, when, evolution, became, a, unified, theory, as, the, modern, synthesis, reconciled, darwinian, evolution, with, classical, genetics, in, the, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, a, series, of, experiments, by, alfred, hershey, and, martha, chase, pointed, to, dna, as, the, component, of, chromosomes, that, held, the, trait, carrying, units, that, had, become, known, as, genes, a, focus, on, new, kinds, of, model, organisms, such, as, viruses, and, bacteria, along, with, the, discovery, of, the, double, helical, structure, of, dna, by, james, watson, and, francis, crick, in, 1953, marked, the, transition, to, the, era, of, molecular, genetics, from, the, 1950s, onwards, biology, has, been, vastly, extended, in, the, molecular, domain, the, genetic, code, was, cracked, by, har, gobind, khorana, robert, w, holley, and, marshall, warren, nirenberg, after, dna, was, understood, to, contain, codons, the, human, genome, project, was, launched, in, 1990, to, map, the, human, genome, all, organisms, are, made, up, of, chemical, elements, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, account, for, most, 96, of, the, mass, of, all, organisms, with, calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and, magnesium, constituting, essentially, all, the, remainder, different, elements, can, combine, to, form, compounds, such, as, water, which, is, fundamental, to, life, biochemistry, is, the, study, of, chemical, processes, within, and, relating, to, living, organisms, molecular, biology, is, the, branch, of, biology, that, seeks, to, understand, the, molecular, basis, of, biological, activity, in, and, between, cells, including, molecular, synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and, interactions, life, arose, from, the, earth, s, first, ocean, which, formed, some, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, since, then, water, continues, to, be, the, most, abundant, molecule, in, every, organism, water, is, important, to, life, because, it, is, an, effective, solvent, capable, of, dissolving, solutes, such, as, sodium, and, chloride, ions, or, other, small, molecules, to, form, an, aqueous, solution, once, dissolved, in, water, these, solutes, are, more, likely, to, come, in, contact, with, one, another, and, therefore, take, part, in, chemical, reactions, that, sustain, life, in, terms, of, its, molecular, structure, water, is, a, small, polar, molecule, with, a, bent, shape, formed, by, the, polar, covalent, bonds, of, two, hydrogen, h, atoms, to, one, oxygen, o, atom, h, 2, o, because, the, o, h, bonds, are, polar, the, oxygen, atom, has, a, slight, negative, charge, and, the, two, hydrogen, atoms, have, a, slight, positive, charge, this, polar, property, of, water, allows, it, to, attract, other, water, molecules, via, hydrogen, bonds, which, makes, water, cohesive, surface, tension, results, from, the, cohesive, force, due, to, the, attraction, between, molecules, at, the, surface, of, the, liquid, water, is, also, adhesive, as, it, is, able, to, adhere, to, the, surface, of, any, polar, or, charged, non, water, molecules, water, is, denser, as, a, liquid, than, it, is, as, a, solid, or, ice, this, unique, property, of, water, allows, ice, to, float, above, liquid, water, such, as, ponds, lakes, and, oceans, thereby, insulating, the, liquid, below, from, the, cold, air, above, water, has, the, capacity, to, absorb, energy, giving, it, a, higher, specific, heat, capacity, than, other, solvents, such, as, ethanol, thus, a, large, amount, of, energy, is, needed, to, break, the, hydrogen, bonds, between, water, molecules, to, convert, liquid, water, into, water, vapor, as, a, molecule, water, is, not, completely, stable, as, each, water, molecule, continuously, dissociates, into, hydrogen, and, hydroxyl, ions, before, reforming, into, a, water, molecule, again, in, pure, water, the, number, of, hydrogen, ions, balances, or, equals, the, number, of, hydroxyl, ions, resulting, in, a, ph, that, is, neutral, organic, compounds, are, molecules, that, contain, carbon, bonded, to, another, element, such, as, hydrogen, with, the, exception, of, water, nearly, all, the, molecules, that, make, up, each, organism, contain, carbon, carbon, can, form, covalent, bonds, with, up, to, four, other, atoms, enabling, it, to, form, diverse, large, and, complex, molecules, for, example, a, single, carbon, atom, can, form, four, single, covalent, bonds, such, as, in, methane, two, double, covalent, bonds, such, as, in, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, or, a, triple, covalent, bond, such, as, in, carbon, monoxide, co, moreover, carbon, can, form, very, long, chains, of, interconnecting, carbon, carbon, bonds, such, as, octane, or, ring, like, structures, such, as, glucose, the, simplest, form, of, an, organic, molecule, is, the, hydrocarbon, which, is, a, large, family, of, organic, compounds, that, are, composed, of, hydrogen, atoms, bonded, to, a, chain, of, carbon, atoms, a, hydrocarbon, backbone, can, be, substituted, by, other, elements, such, as, oxygen, o, hydrogen, h, phosphorus, p, and, sulfur, s, which, can, change, the, chemical, behavior, of, that, compound, groups, of, atoms, that, contain, these, elements, o, h, p, and, s, and, are, bonded, to, a, central, carbon, atom, or, skeleton, are, called, functional, groups, there, are, six, prominent, functional, groups, that, can, be, found, in, organisms, amino, group, carboxyl, group, carbonyl, group, hydroxyl, group, phosphate, group, and, sulfhydryl, group, in, 1953, the, miller, urey, experiment, showed, that, organic, compounds, could, be, synthesized, abiotically, within, a, closed, system, mimicking, the, conditions, of, early, earth, thus, suggesting, that, complex, organic, molecules, could, have, arisen, spontaneously, in, early, earth, see, abiogenesis, macromolecules, are, large, molecules, made, up, of, smaller, subunits, or, monomers, monomers, include, sugars, amino, acids, and, nucleotides, carbohydrates, include, monomers, and, polymers, of, sugars, lipids, are, the, only, class, of, macromolecules, that, are, not, made, up, of, polymers, they, include, steroids, phospholipids, and, fats, largely, nonpolar, and, hydrophobic, water, repelling, substances, proteins, are, the, most, diverse, of, the, macromolecules, they, include, enzymes, transport, proteins, large, signaling, molecules, antibodies, and, structural, proteins, the, basic, unit, or, monomer, of, a, protein, is, an, amino, acid, twenty, amino, acids, are, used, in, proteins, nucleic, acids, are, polymers, of, nucleotides, their, function, is, to, store, transmit, and, express, hereditary, information, cell, theory, states, that, cells, are, the, fundamental, units, of, life, that, all, living, things, are, composed, of, one, or, more, cells, and, that, all, cells, arise, from, preexisting, cells, through, cell, division, most, cells, are, very, small, with, diameters, ranging, from, 1, to, 100, micrometers, and, are, therefore, only, visible, under, a, light, or, electron, microscope, there, are, generally, two, types, of, cells, eukaryotic, cells, which, contain, a, nucleus, and, prokaryotic, cells, which, do, not, prokaryotes, are, single, celled, organisms, such, as, bacteria, whereas, eukaryotes, can, be, single, celled, or, multicellular, in, multicellular, organisms, every, cell, in, the, organism, s, body, is, derived, ultimately, from, a, single, cell, in, a, fertilized, egg, every, cell, is, enclosed, within, a, cell, membrane, that, separates, its, cytoplasm, from, the, extracellular, space, a, cell, membrane, consists, of, a, lipid, bilayer, including, cholesterols, that, sit, between, phospholipids, to, maintain, their, fluidity, at, various, temperatures, cell, membranes, are, semipermeable, allowing, small, molecules, such, as, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, and, water, to, pass, through, while, restricting, the, movement, of, larger, molecules, and, charged, particles, such, as, ions, cell, membranes, also, contain, membrane, proteins, including, integral, membrane, proteins, that, go, across, the, membrane, serving, as, membrane, transporters, and, peripheral, proteins, that, loosely, attach, to, the, outer, side, of, the, cell, membrane, acting, as, enzymes, shaping, the, cell, cell, membranes, are, involved, in, various, cellular, processes, such, as, cell, adhesion, storing, electrical, energy, and, cell, signalling, and, serve, as, the, attachment, surface, for, several, extracellular, structures, such, as, a, cell, wall, glycocalyx, and, cytoskeleton, within, the, cytoplasm, of, a, cell, there, are, many, biomolecules, such, as, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, in, addition, to, biomolecules, eukaryotic, cells, have, specialized, structures, called, organelles, that, have, their, own, lipid, bilayers, or, are, spatially, units, these, organelles, include, the, cell, nucleus, which, contains, most, of, the, cell, s, dna, or, mitochondria, which, generate, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, to, power, cellular, processes, other, organelles, such, as, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, golgi, apparatus, play, a, role, in, the, synthesis, and, packaging, of, proteins, respectively, biomolecules, such, as, proteins, can, be, engulfed, by, lysosomes, another, specialized, organelle, plant, cells, have, additional, organelles, that, distinguish, them, from, animal, cells, such, as, a, cell, wall, that, provides, support, for, the, plant, cell, chloroplasts, that, harvest, sunlight, energy, to, produce, sugar, and, vacuoles, that, provide, storage, and, structural, support, as, well, as, being, involved, in, reproduction, and, breakdown, of, plant, seeds, eukaryotic, cells, also, have, cytoskeleton, that, is, made, up, of, microtubules, intermediate, filaments, and, microfilaments, all, of, which, provide, support, for, the, cell, and, are, involved, in, the, movement, of, the, cell, and, its, organelles, in, terms, of, their, structural, composition, the, microtubules, are, made, up, of, tubulin, e, g, tubulin, and, tubulin, whereas, intermediate, filaments, are, made, up, of, fibrous, proteins, microfilaments, are, made, up, of, actin, molecules, that, interact, with, other, strands, of, proteins, all, cells, require, energy, to, sustain, cellular, processes, metabolism, is, the, set, of, chemical, reactions, in, an, organism, the, three, main, purposes, of, metabolism, are, the, conversion, of, food, to, energy, to, run, cellular, processes, the, conversion, of, food, fuel, to, monomer, building, blocks, and, the, elimination, of, metabolic, wastes, these, enzyme, catalyzed, reactions, allow, organisms, to, grow, and, reproduce, maintain, their, structures, and, respond, to, their, environments, metabolic, reactions, may, be, categorized, as, catabolic, the, breaking, down, of, compounds, for, example, the, breaking, down, of, glucose, to, pyruvate, by, cellular, respiration, or, anabolic, the, building, up, synthesis, of, compounds, such, as, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and, nucleic, acids, usually, catabolism, releases, energy, and, anabolism, consumes, energy, the, chemical, reactions, of, metabolism, are, organized, into, metabolic, pathways, in, which, one, chemical, is, transformed, through, a, series, of, steps, into, another, chemical, each, step, being, facilitated, by, a, specific, enzyme, enzymes, are, crucial, to, metabolism, because, they, allow, organisms, to, drive, desirable, reactions, that, require, energy, that, will, not, occur, by, themselves, by, coupling, them, to, spontaneous, reactions, that, release, energy, enzymes, act, as, catalysts, they, allow, a, reaction, to, proceed, more, rapidly, without, being, consumed, by, it, by, reducing, the, amount, of, activation, energy, needed, to, convert, reactants, into, products, enzymes, also, allow, the, regulation, of, the, rate, of, a, metabolic, reaction, for, example, in, response, to, changes, in, the, cell, s, environment, or, to, signals, from, other, cells, cellular, respiration, is, a, set, of, metabolic, reactions, and, processes, that, take, place, in, cells, to, convert, chemical, energy, from, nutrients, into, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, and, then, release, waste, products, the, reactions, involved, in, respiration, are, catabolic, reactions, which, break, large, molecules, into, smaller, ones, releasing, energy, respiration, is, one, of, the, key, ways, a, cell, releases, chemical, energy, to, fuel, cellular, activity, the, overall, reaction, occurs, in, a, series, of, biochemical, steps, some, of, which, are, redox, reactions, although, cellular, respiration, is, technically, a, combustion, reaction, it, clearly, does, not, resemble, one, when, it, occurs, in, a, cell, because, of, the, slow, controlled, release, of, energy, from, the, series, of, reactions, sugar, in, the, form, of, glucose, is, the, main, nutrient, used, by, animal, and, plant, cells, in, respiration, cellular, respiration, involving, oxygen, is, called, aerobic, respiration, which, has, four, stages, glycolysis, citric, acid, cycle, or, krebs, cycle, electron, transport, chain, and, oxidative, phosphorylation, glycolysis, is, a, metabolic, process, that, occurs, in, the, cytoplasm, whereby, glucose, is, converted, into, two, pyruvates, with, two, net, molecules, of, atp, being, produced, at, the, same, time, each, pyruvate, is, then, oxidized, into, acetyl, coa, by, the, pyruvate, dehydrogenase, complex, which, also, generates, nadh, and, carbon, dioxide, acetyl, coa, enters, the, citric, acid, cycle, which, takes, places, inside, the, mitochondrial, matrix, at, the, end, of, the, cycle, the, total, yield, from, 1, glucose, or, 2, pyruvates, is, 6, nadh, 2, fadh, 2, and, 2, atp, molecules, finally, the, next, stage, is, oxidative, phosphorylation, which, in, eukaryotes, occurs, in, the, mitochondrial, cristae, oxidative, phosphorylation, comprises, the, electron, transport, chain, which, is, a, series, of, four, protein, complexes, that, transfer, electrons, from, one, complex, to, another, thereby, releasing, energy, from, nadh, and, fadh, 2, that, is, coupled, to, the, pumping, of, protons, hydrogen, ions, across, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, chemiosmosis, which, generates, a, proton, motive, force, energy, from, the, proton, motive, force, drives, the, enzyme, atp, synthase, to, synthesize, more, atps, by, phosphorylating, adps, the, transfer, of, electrons, terminates, with, molecular, oxygen, being, the, final, electron, acceptor, if, oxygen, were, not, present, pyruvate, would, not, be, metabolized, by, cellular, respiration, but, undergoes, a, process, of, fermentation, the, pyruvate, is, not, transported, into, the, mitochondrion, but, remains, in, the, cytoplasm, where, it, is, converted, to, waste, products, that, may, be, removed, from, the, cell, this, serves, the, purpose, of, oxidizing, the, electron, carriers, so, that, they, can, perform, glycolysis, again, and, removing, the, excess, pyruvate, fermentation, oxidizes, nadh, to, nad, so, it, can, be, re, used, in, glycolysis, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, fermentation, prevents, the, buildup, of, nadh, in, the, cytoplasm, and, provides, nad, for, glycolysis, this, waste, product, varies, depending, on, the, organism, in, skeletal, muscles, the, waste, product, is, lactic, acid, this, type, of, fermentation, is, called, lactic, acid, fermentation, in, strenuous, exercise, when, energy, demands, exceed, energy, supply, the, respiratory, chain, cannot, process, all, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, joined, by, nadh, during, anaerobic, glycolysis, nad, regenerates, when, pairs, of, hydrogen, combine, with, pyruvate, to, form, lactate, lactate, formation, is, catalyzed, by, lactate, dehydrogenase, in, a, reversible, reaction, lactate, can, also, be, used, as, an, indirect, precursor, for, liver, glycogen, during, recovery, when, oxygen, becomes, available, nad, attaches, to, hydrogen, from, lactate, to, form, atp, in, yeast, the, waste, products, are, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, this, type, of, fermentation, is, known, as, alcoholic, or, ethanol, fermentation, the, atp, generated, in, this, process, is, made, by, substrate, level, phosphorylation, which, does, not, require, oxygen, photosynthesis, is, a, process, used, by, plants, and, other, organisms, to, convert, light, energy, into, chemical, energy, that, can, later, be, released, to, fuel, the, organism, s, metabolic, activities, via, cellular, respiration, this, chemical, energy, is, stored, in, carbohydrate, molecules, such, as, sugars, which, are, synthesized, from, carbon, dioxide, and, water, in, most, cases, oxygen, is, released, as, a, waste, product, most, plants, algae, and, cyanobacteria, perform, photosynthesis, which, is, largely, responsible, for, producing, and, maintaining, the, oxygen, content, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, supplies, most, of, the, energy, necessary, for, life, on, earth, photosynthesis, has, four, stages, light, absorption, electron, transport, atp, synthesis, and, carbon, fixation, light, absorption, is, the, initial, step, of, photosynthesis, whereby, light, energy, is, absorbed, by, chlorophyll, pigments, attached, to, proteins, in, the, thylakoid, membranes, the, absorbed, light, energy, is, used, to, remove, electrons, from, a, donor, water, to, a, primary, electron, acceptor, a, quinone, designated, as, q, in, the, second, stage, electrons, move, from, the, quinone, primary, electron, acceptor, through, a, series, of, electron, carriers, until, they, reach, a, final, electron, acceptor, which, is, usually, the, oxidized, form, of, nadp, which, is, reduced, to, nadph, a, process, that, takes, place, in, a, protein, complex, called, photosystem, i, psi, the, transport, of, electrons, is, coupled, to, the, movement, of, protons, or, hydrogen, from, the, stroma, to, the, thylakoid, membrane, which, forms, a, ph, gradient, across, the, membrane, as, hydrogen, becomes, more, concentrated, in, the, lumen, than, in, the, stroma, this, is, analogous, to, the, proton, motive, force, generated, across, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, in, aerobic, respiration, during, the, third, stage, of, photosynthesis, the, movement, of, protons, down, their, concentration, gradients, from, the, thylakoid, lumen, to, the, stroma, through, the, atp, synthase, is, coupled, to, the, synthesis, of, atp, by, that, same, atp, synthase, the, nadph, and, atps, generated, by, the, light, dependent, reactions, in, the, second, and, third, stages, respectively, provide, the, energy, and, electrons, to, drive, the, synthesis, of, glucose, by, fixing, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, into, existing, organic, carbon, compounds, such, as, ribulose, bisphosphate, rubp, in, a, sequence, of, light, independent, or, dark, reactions, called, the, calvin, cycle, cell, signaling, or, communication, is, the, ability, of, cells, to, receive, process, and, transmit, signals, with, its, environment, and, with, itself, signals, can, be, non, chemical, such, as, light, electrical, impulses, and, heat, or, chemical, signals, or, ligands, that, interact, with, receptors, which, can, be, found, embedded, in, the, cell, membrane, of, another, cell, or, located, deep, inside, a, cell, there, are, generally, four, types, of, chemical, signals, autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and, hormones, in, autocrine, signaling, the, ligand, affects, the, same, cell, that, releases, it, tumor, cells, for, example, can, reproduce, uncontrollably, because, they, release, signals, that, initiate, their, own, self, division, in, paracrine, signaling, the, ligand, diffuses, to, nearby, cells, and, affects, them, for, example, brain, cells, called, neurons, release, ligands, called, neurotransmitters, that, diffuse, across, a, synaptic, cleft, to, bind, with, a, receptor, on, an, adjacent, cell, such, as, another, neuron, or, muscle, cell, in, juxtacrine, signaling, there, is, direct, contact, between, the, signaling, and, responding, cells, finally, hormones, are, ligands, that, travel, through, the, circulatory, systems, of, animals, or, vascular, systems, of, plants, to, reach, their, target, cells, once, a, ligand, binds, with, a, receptor, it, can, influence, the, behavior, of, another, cell, depending, on, the, type, of, receptor, for, instance, neurotransmitters, that, bind, with, an, inotropic, receptor, can, alter, the, excitability, of, a, target, cell, other, types, of, receptors, include, protein, kinase, receptors, e, g, receptor, for, the, hormone, insulin, and, g, protein, coupled, receptors, activation, of, g, protein, coupled, receptors, can, initiate, second, messenger, cascades, the, process, by, which, a, chemical, or, physical, signal, is, transmitted, through, a, cell, as, a, series, of, molecular, events, is, called, signal, transduction, the, cell, cycle, is, a, series, of, events, that, take, place, in, a, cell, that, cause, it, to, divide, into, two, daughter, cells, these, events, include, the, duplication, of, its, dna, and, some, of, its, organelles, and, the, subsequent, partitioning, of, its, cytoplasm, into, two, daughter, cells, in, a, process, called, cell, division, in, eukaryotes, i, e, animal, plant, fungal, and, protist, cells, there, are, two, distinct, types, of, cell, division, mitosis, and, meiosis, mitosis, is, part, of, the, cell, cycle, in, which, replicated, chromosomes, are, separated, into, two, new, nuclei, cell, division, gives, rise, to, genetically, identical, cells, in, which, the, total, number, of, chromosomes, is, maintained, in, general, mitosis, division, of, the, nucleus, is, preceded, by, the, s, stage, of, interphase, during, which, the, dna, is, replicated, and, is, often, followed, by, telophase, and, cytokinesis, which, divides, the, cytoplasm, organelles, and, cell, membrane, of, one, cell, into, two, new, cells, containing, roughly, equal, shares, of, these, cellular, components, the, different, stages, of, mitosis, all, together, define, the, mitotic, phase, of, an, animal, cell, cycle, the, division, of, the, mother, cell, into, two, genetically, identical, daughter, cells, the, cell, cycle, is, a, vital, process, by, which, a, single, celled, fertilized, egg, develops, into, a, mature, organism, as, well, as, the, process, by, which, hair, skin, blood, cells, and, some, internal, organs, are, renewed, after, cell, division, each, of, the, daughter, cells, begin, the, interphase, of, a, new, cycle, in, contrast, to, mitosis, meiosis, results, in, four, haploid, daughter, cells, by, undergoing, one, round, of, dna, replication, followed, by, two, divisions, homologous, chromosomes, are, separated, in, the, first, division, meiosis, i, and, sister, chromatids, are, separated, in, the, second, division, meiosis, ii, both, of, these, cell, division, cycles, are, used, in, the, process, of, sexual, reproduction, at, some, point, in, their, life, cycle, both, are, believed, to, be, present, in, the, last, eukaryotic, common, ancestor, prokaryotes, i, e, archaea, and, bacteria, can, also, undergo, cell, division, or, binary, fission, unlike, the, processes, of, mitosis, and, meiosis, in, eukaryotes, binary, fission, in, prokaryotes, takes, place, without, the, formation, of, a, spindle, apparatus, on, the, cell, before, binary, fission, dna, in, the, bacterium, is, tightly, coiled, after, it, has, uncoiled, and, duplicated, it, is, pulled, to, the, separate, poles, of, the, bacterium, as, it, increases, the, size, to, prepare, for, splitting, growth, of, a, new, cell, wall, begins, to, separate, the, bacterium, triggered, by, ftsz, polymerization, and, z, ring, formation, the, new, cell, wall, septum, fully, develops, resulting, in, the, complete, split, of, the, bacterium, the, new, daughter, cells, have, tightly, coiled, dna, rods, ribosomes, and, plasmids, meiosis, is, a, central, feature, of, sexual, reproduction, in, eukaryotes, and, the, most, fundamental, function, of, meiosis, appears, to, be, conservation, of, the, integrity, of, the, genome, that, is, passed, on, to, progeny, by, parents, two, aspects, of, sexual, reproduction, meiotic, recombination, and, outcrossing, are, likely, maintained, respectively, by, the, adaptive, advantages, of, recombinational, repair, of, genomic, dna, damage, and, genetic, complementation, which, masks, the, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, mutations, the, beneficial, effect, of, genetic, complementation, derived, from, outcrossing, cross, fertilization, is, also, referred, to, as, hybrid, vigor, or, heterosis, charles, darwin, in, his, 1878, book, the, effects, of, cross, and, self, fertilization, in, the, vegetable, kingdom, at, the, start, of, chapter, xii, noted, the, first, and, most, important, of, the, conclusions, which, may, be, drawn, from, the, observations, given, in, this, volume, is, that, generally, cross, fertilisation, is, beneficial, and, self, fertilisation, often, injurious, at, least, with, the, plants, on, which, i, experimented, genetic, variation, often, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, sexual, reproduction, may, provide, long, term, advantages, to, those, sexual, lineages, that, engage, in, outcrossing, genetics, is, the, scientific, study, of, inheritance, mendelian, inheritance, specifically, is, the, process, by, which, genes, and, traits, are, passed, on, from, parents, to, offspring, it, has, several, principles, the, first, is, that, genetic, characteristics, alleles, are, discrete, and, have, alternate, forms, e, g, purple, vs, white, or, tall, vs, dwarf, each, inherited, from, one, of, two, parents, based, on, the, law, of, dominance, and, uniformity, which, states, that, some, alleles, are, dominant, while, others, are, recessive, an, organism, with, at, least, one, dominant, allele, will, display, the, phenotype, of, that, dominant, allele, during, gamete, formation, the, alleles, for, each, gene, segregate, so, that, each, gamete, carries, only, one, allele, for, each, gene, heterozygotic, individuals, produce, gametes, with, an, equal, frequency, of, two, alleles, finally, the, law, of, independent, assortment, states, that, genes, of, different, traits, can, segregate, independently, during, the, formation, of, gametes, i, e, genes, are, unlinked, an, exception, to, this, rule, would, include, traits, that, are, sex, linked, test, crosses, can, be, performed, to, experimentally, determine, the, underlying, genotype, of, an, organism, with, a, dominant, phenotype, a, punnett, square, can, be, used, to, predict, the, results, of, a, test, cross, the, chromosome, theory, of, inheritance, which, states, that, genes, are, found, on, chromosomes, was, supported, by, thomas, morgans, s, experiments, with, fruit, flies, which, established, the, sex, linkage, between, eye, color, and, sex, in, these, insects, a, gene, is, a, unit, of, heredity, that, corresponds, to, a, region, of, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, that, carries, genetic, information, that, controls, form, or, function, of, an, organism, dna, is, composed, of, two, polynucleotide, chains, that, coil, around, each, other, to, form, a, double, helix, it, is, found, as, linear, chromosomes, in, eukaryotes, and, circular, chromosomes, in, prokaryotes, the, set, of, chromosomes, in, a, cell, is, collectively, known, as, its, genome, in, eukaryotes, dna, is, mainly, in, the, cell, nucleus, in, prokaryotes, the, dna, is, held, within, the, nucleoid, the, genetic, information, is, held, within, genes, and, the, complete, assemblage, in, an, organism, is, called, its, genotype, dna, replication, is, a, semiconservative, process, whereby, each, strand, serves, as, a, template, for, a, new, strand, of, dna, mutations, are, heritable, changes, in, dna, they, can, arise, spontaneously, as, a, result, of, replication, errors, that, were, not, corrected, by, proofreading, or, can, be, induced, by, an, environmental, mutagen, such, as, a, chemical, e, g, nitrous, acid, benzopyrene, or, radiation, e, g, x, ray, gamma, ray, ultraviolet, radiation, particles, emitted, by, unstable, isotopes, mutations, can, lead, to, phenotypic, effects, such, as, loss, of, function, gain, of, function, and, conditional, mutations, some, mutations, are, beneficial, as, they, are, a, source, of, genetic, variation, for, evolution, others, are, harmful, if, they, were, to, result, in, a, loss, of, function, of, genes, needed, for, survival, gene, expression, is, the, molecular, process, by, which, a, genotype, encoded, in, dna, gives, rise, to, an, observable, phenotype, in, the, proteins, of, an, organism, s, body, this, process, is, summarized, by, the, central, dogma, of, molecular, biology, which, was, formulated, by, francis, crick, in, 1958, according, to, the, central, dogma, genetic, information, flows, from, dna, to, rna, to, protein, there, are, two, gene, expression, processes, transcription, dna, to, rna, and, translation, rna, to, protein, the, regulation, of, gene, expression, by, environmental, factors, and, during, different, stages, of, development, can, occur, at, each, step, of, the, process, such, as, transcription, rna, splicing, translation, and, post, translational, modification, of, a, protein, gene, expression, can, be, influenced, by, positive, or, negative, regulation, depending, on, which, of, the, two, types, of, regulatory, proteins, called, transcription, factors, bind, to, the, dna, sequence, close, to, or, at, a, promoter, a, cluster, of, genes, that, share, the, same, promoter, is, called, an, operon, found, mainly, in, prokaryotes, and, some, lower, eukaryotes, e, g, caenorhabditis, elegans, in, positive, regulation, of, gene, expression, the, activator, is, the, transcription, factor, that, stimulates, transcription, when, it, binds, to, the, sequence, near, or, at, the, promoter, negative, regulation, occurs, when, another, transcription, factor, called, a, repressor, binds, to, a, dna, sequence, called, an, operator, which, is, part, of, an, operon, to, prevent, transcription, repressors, can, be, inhibited, by, compounds, called, inducers, e, g, allolactose, thereby, allowing, transcription, to, occur, specific, genes, that, can, be, activated, by, inducers, are, called, inducible, genes, in, contrast, to, constitutive, genes, that, are, almost, constantly, active, in, contrast, to, both, structural, genes, encode, proteins, that, are, not, involved, in, gene, regulation, in, addition, to, regulatory, events, involving, the, promoter, gene, expression, can, also, be, regulated, by, epigenetic, changes, to, chromatin, which, is, a, complex, of, dna, and, protein, found, in, eukaryotic, cells, development, is, the, process, by, which, a, multicellular, organism, plant, or, animal, goes, through, a, series, of, changes, starting, from, a, single, cell, and, taking, on, various, forms, that, are, characteristic, of, its, life, cycle, there, are, four, key, processes, that, underlie, development, determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and, growth, determination, sets, the, developmental, fate, of, a, cell, which, becomes, more, restrictive, during, development, differentiation, is, the, process, by, which, specialized, cells, arise, from, less, specialized, cells, such, as, stem, cells, stem, cells, are, undifferentiated, or, partially, differentiated, cells, that, can, differentiate, into, various, types, of, cells, and, proliferate, indefinitely, to, produce, more, of, the, same, stem, cell, cellular, differentiation, dramatically, changes, a, cell, s, size, shape, membrane, potential, metabolic, activity, and, responsiveness, to, signals, which, are, largely, due, to, highly, controlled, modifications, in, gene, expression, and, epigenetics, with, a, few, exceptions, cellular, differentiation, almost, never, involves, a, change, in, the, dna, sequence, itself, thus, different, cells, can, have, very, different, physical, characteristics, despite, having, the, same, genome, morphogenesis, or, the, development, of, body, form, is, the, result, of, spatial, differences, in, gene, expression, a, small, fraction, of, the, genes, in, an, organism, s, genome, called, the, developmental, genetic, toolkit, control, the, development, of, that, organism, these, toolkit, genes, are, highly, conserved, among, phyla, meaning, that, they, are, ancient, and, very, similar, in, widely, separated, groups, of, animals, differences, in, deployment, of, toolkit, genes, affect, the, body, plan, and, the, number, identity, and, pattern, of, body, parts, among, the, most, important, toolkit, genes, are, the, hox, genes, hox, genes, determine, where, repeating, parts, such, as, the, many, vertebrae, of, snakes, will, grow, in, a, developing, embryo, or, larva, evolution, is, a, central, organizing, concept, in, biology, it, is, the, change, in, heritable, characteristics, of, populations, over, successive, generations, in, artificial, selection, animals, were, selectively, bred, for, specific, traits, given, that, traits, are, inherited, populations, contain, a, varied, mix, of, traits, and, reproduction, is, able, to, increase, any, population, darwin, argued, that, in, the, natural, world, it, was, nature, that, played, the, role, of, humans, in, selecting, for, specific, traits, darwin, inferred, that, individuals, who, possessed, heritable, traits, better, adapted, to, their, environments, are, more, likely, to, survive, and, produce, more, offspring, than, other, individuals, he, further, inferred, that, this, would, lead, to, the, accumulation, of, favorable, traits, over, successive, generations, thereby, increasing, the, match, between, the, organisms, and, their, environment, a, species, is, a, group, of, organisms, that, mate, with, one, another, and, speciation, is, the, process, by, which, one, lineage, splits, into, two, lineages, as, a, result, of, having, evolved, independently, from, each, other, for, speciation, to, occur, there, has, to, be, reproductive, isolation, reproductive, isolation, can, result, from, incompatibilities, between, genes, as, described, by, bateson, dobzhansky, muller, model, reproductive, isolation, also, tends, to, increase, with, genetic, divergence, speciation, can, occur, when, there, are, physical, barriers, that, divide, an, ancestral, species, a, process, known, as, allopatric, speciation, a, phylogeny, is, an, evolutionary, history, of, a, specific, group, of, organisms, or, their, genes, it, can, be, represented, using, a, phylogenetic, tree, a, diagram, showing, lines, of, descent, among, organisms, or, their, genes, each, line, drawn, on, the, time, axis, of, a, tree, represents, a, lineage, of, descendants, of, a, particular, species, or, population, when, a, lineage, divides, into, two, it, is, represented, as, a, fork, or, split, on, the, phylogenetic, tree, phylogenetic, trees, are, the, basis, for, comparing, and, grouping, different, species, different, species, that, share, a, feature, inherited, from, a, common, ancestor, are, described, as, having, homologous, features, or, synapomorphy, phylogeny, provides, the, basis, of, biological, classification, this, classification, system, is, rank, based, with, the, highest, rank, being, the, domain, followed, by, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and, species, all, organisms, can, be, classified, as, belonging, to, one, of, three, domains, archaea, originally, archaebacteria, bacteria, originally, eubacteria, or, eukarya, includes, the, fungi, plant, and, animal, kingdoms, the, history, of, life, on, earth, traces, how, organisms, have, evolved, from, the, earliest, emergence, of, life, to, present, day, earth, formed, about, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, and, all, life, on, earth, both, living, and, extinct, descended, from, a, last, universal, common, ancestor, that, lived, about, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, geologists, have, developed, a, geologic, time, scale, that, divides, the, history, of, the, earth, into, major, divisions, starting, with, four, eons, hadean, archean, proterozoic, and, phanerozoic, the, first, three, of, which, are, collectively, known, as, the, precambrian, which, lasted, approximately, 4, billion, years, each, eon, can, be, divided, into, eras, with, the, phanerozoic, eon, that, began, 539, million, years, ago, being, subdivided, into, paleozoic, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, eras, these, three, eras, together, comprise, eleven, periods, cambrian, ordovician, silurian, devonian, carboniferous, permian, triassic, jurassic, cretaceous, tertiary, and, quaternary, the, similarities, among, all, known, present, day, species, indicate, that, they, have, diverged, through, the, process, of, evolution, from, their, common, ancestor, biologists, regard, the, ubiquity, of, the, genetic, code, as, evidence, of, universal, common, descent, for, all, bacteria, archaea, and, eukaryotes, microbial, mats, of, coexisting, bacteria, and, archaea, were, the, dominant, form, of, life, in, the, early, archean, eon, and, many, of, the, major, steps, in, early, evolution, are, thought, to, have, taken, place, in, this, environment, the, earliest, evidence, of, eukaryotes, dates, from, 1, 85, billion, years, ago, and, while, they, may, have, been, present, earlier, their, diversification, accelerated, when, they, started, using, oxygen, in, their, metabolism, later, around, 1, 7, billion, years, ago, multicellular, organisms, began, to, appear, with, differentiated, cells, performing, specialised, functions, algae, like, multicellular, land, plants, are, dated, back, to, about, 1, billion, years, ago, although, evidence, suggests, that, microorganisms, formed, the, earliest, terrestrial, ecosystems, at, least, 2, 7, billion, years, ago, microorganisms, are, thought, to, have, paved, the, way, for, the, inception, of, land, plants, in, the, ordovician, period, land, plants, were, so, successful, that, they, are, thought, to, have, contributed, to, the, late, devonian, extinction, event, ediacara, biota, appear, during, the, ediacaran, period, while, vertebrates, along, with, most, other, modern, phyla, originated, about, 525, million, years, ago, during, the, cambrian, explosion, during, the, permian, period, synapsids, including, the, ancestors, of, mammals, dominated, the, land, but, most, of, this, group, became, extinct, in, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, 252, million, years, ago, during, the, recovery, from, this, catastrophe, archosaurs, became, the, most, abundant, land, vertebrates, one, archosaur, group, the, dinosaurs, dominated, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, periods, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, 66, million, years, ago, killed, off, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, mammals, increased, rapidly, in, size, and, diversity, such, mass, extinctions, may, have, accelerated, evolution, by, providing, opportunities, for, new, groups, of, organisms, to, diversify, bacteria, are, a, type, of, cell, that, constitute, a, large, domain, of, prokaryotic, microorganisms, typically, a, few, micrometers, in, length, bacteria, have, a, number, of, shapes, ranging, from, spheres, to, rods, and, spirals, bacteria, were, among, the, first, life, forms, to, appear, on, earth, and, are, present, in, most, of, its, habitats, bacteria, inhabit, soil, water, acidic, hot, springs, radioactive, waste, and, the, deep, biosphere, of, the, earth, s, crust, bacteria, also, live, in, symbiotic, and, parasitic, relationships, with, plants, and, animals, most, bacteria, have, not, been, characterised, and, only, about, 27, percent, of, the, bacterial, phyla, have, species, that, can, be, grown, in, the, laboratory, archaea, constitute, the, other, domain, of, prokaryotic, cells, and, were, initially, classified, as, bacteria, receiving, the, name, archaebacteria, in, the, archaebacteria, kingdom, a, term, that, has, fallen, out, of, use, archaeal, cells, have, unique, properties, separating, them, from, the, other, two, domains, bacteria, and, eukaryota, archaea, are, further, divided, into, multiple, recognized, phyla, archaea, and, bacteria, are, generally, similar, in, size, and, shape, although, a, few, archaea, have, very, different, shapes, such, as, the, flat, and, square, cells, of, haloquadratum, walsbyi, despite, this, morphological, similarity, to, bacteria, archaea, possess, genes, and, several, metabolic, pathways, that, are, more, closely, related, to, those, of, eukaryotes, notably, for, the, enzymes, involved, in, transcription, and, translation, other, aspects, of, archaeal, biochemistry, are, unique, such, as, their, reliance, on, ether, lipids, in, their, cell, membranes, including, archaeols, archaea, use, more, energy, sources, than, eukaryotes, these, range, from, organic, compounds, such, as, sugars, to, ammonia, metal, ions, or, even, hydrogen, gas, salt, tolerant, archaea, the, haloarchaea, use, sunlight, as, an, energy, source, and, other, species, of, archaea, fix, carbon, but, unlike, plants, and, cyanobacteria, no, known, species, of, archaea, does, both, archaea, reproduce, asexually, by, binary, fission, fragmentation, or, budding, unlike, bacteria, no, known, species, of, archaea, form, endospores, the, first, observed, archaea, were, extremophiles, living, in, extreme, environments, such, as, hot, springs, and, salt, lakes, with, no, other, organisms, improved, molecular, detection, tools, led, to, the, discovery, of, archaea, in, almost, every, habitat, including, soil, oceans, and, marshlands, archaea, are, particularly, numerous, in, the, oceans, and, the, archaea, in, plankton, may, be, one, of, the, most, abundant, groups, of, organisms, on, the, planet, archaea, are, a, major, part, of, earth, s, life, they, are, part, of, the, microbiota, of, all, organisms, in, the, human, microbiome, they, are, important, in, the, gut, mouth, and, on, the, skin, their, morphological, metabolic, and, geographical, diversity, permits, them, to, play, multiple, ecological, roles, carbon, fixation, nitrogen, cycling, organic, compound, turnover, and, maintaining, microbial, symbiotic, and, syntrophic, communities, for, example, eukaryotes, are, hypothesized, to, have, split, from, archaea, which, was, followed, by, their, endosymbioses, with, bacteria, or, symbiogenesis, that, gave, rise, to, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, both, of, which, are, now, part, of, modern, day, eukaryotic, cells, the, major, lineages, of, eukaryotes, diversified, in, the, precambrian, about, 1, 5, billion, years, ago, and, can, be, classified, into, eight, major, clades, alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and, animals, five, of, these, clades, are, collectively, known, as, protists, which, are, mostly, microscopic, eukaryotic, organisms, that, are, not, plants, fungi, or, animals, while, it, is, likely, that, protists, share, a, common, ancestor, the, last, eukaryotic, common, ancestor, protists, by, themselves, do, not, constitute, a, separate, clade, as, some, protists, may, be, more, closely, related, to, plants, fungi, or, animals, than, they, are, to, other, protists, like, groupings, such, as, algae, invertebrates, or, protozoans, the, protist, grouping, is, not, a, formal, taxonomic, group, but, is, used, for, convenience, most, protists, are, unicellular, these, are, called, microbial, eukaryotes, plants, are, mainly, multicellular, organisms, predominantly, photosynthetic, eukaryotes, of, the, kingdom, plantae, which, would, exclude, fungi, and, some, algae, plant, cells, were, derived, by, endosymbiosis, of, a, cyanobacterium, into, an, early, eukaryote, about, one, billion, years, ago, which, gave, rise, to, chloroplasts, the, first, several, clades, that, emerged, following, primary, endosymbiosis, were, aquatic, and, most, of, the, aquatic, photosynthetic, eukaryotic, organisms, are, collectively, described, as, algae, which, is, a, term, of, convenience, as, not, all, algae, are, closely, related, algae, comprise, several, distinct, clades, such, as, glaucophytes, which, are, microscopic, freshwater, algae, that, may, have, resembled, in, form, to, the, early, unicellular, ancestor, of, plantae, unlike, glaucophytes, the, other, algal, clades, such, as, red, and, green, algae, are, multicellular, green, algae, comprise, three, major, clades, chlorophytes, coleochaetophytes, and, stoneworts, fungi, are, eukaryotes, that, digest, foods, outside, their, bodies, secreting, digestive, enzymes, that, break, down, large, food, molecules, before, absorbing, them, through, their, cell, membranes, many, fungi, are, also, saprobes, feeding, on, dead, organic, matter, making, them, important, decomposers, in, ecological, systems, animals, are, multicellular, eukaryotes, with, few, exceptions, animals, consume, organic, material, breathe, oxygen, are, able, to, move, can, reproduce, sexually, and, grow, from, a, hollow, sphere, of, cells, the, blastula, during, embryonic, development, over, 1, 5, million, living, animal, species, have, been, described, of, which, around, 1, million, are, insects, but, it, has, been, estimated, there, are, over, 7, million, animal, species, in, total, they, have, complex, interactions, with, each, other, and, their, environments, forming, intricate, food, webs, viruses, are, submicroscopic, infectious, agents, that, replicate, inside, the, cells, of, organisms, viruses, infect, all, types, of, life, forms, from, animals, and, plants, to, microorganisms, including, bacteria, and, archaea, more, than, 6, 000, virus, species, have, been, described, in, detail, viruses, are, found, in, almost, every, ecosystem, on, earth, and, are, the, most, numerous, type, of, biological, entity, the, origins, of, viruses, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, are, unclear, some, may, have, evolved, from, plasmids, pieces, of, dna, that, can, move, between, cells, while, others, may, have, evolved, from, bacteria, in, evolution, viruses, are, an, important, means, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, which, increases, genetic, diversity, in, a, way, analogous, to, sexual, reproduction, because, viruses, possess, some, but, not, all, characteristics, of, life, they, have, been, described, as, organisms, at, the, edge, of, life, and, as, self, replicators, ecology, is, the, study, of, the, distribution, and, abundance, of, life, the, interaction, between, organisms, and, their, environment, the, community, of, living, biotic, organisms, in, conjunction, with, the, nonliving, abiotic, components, e, g, water, light, radiation, temperature, humidity, atmosphere, acidity, and, soil, of, their, environment, is, called, an, ecosystem, these, biotic, and, abiotic, components, are, linked, together, through, nutrient, cycles, and, energy, flows, energy, from, the, sun, enters, the, system, through, photosynthesis, and, is, incorporated, into, plant, tissue, by, feeding, on, plants, and, on, one, another, animals, move, matter, and, energy, through, the, system, they, also, influence, the, quantity, of, plant, and, microbial, biomass, present, by, breaking, down, dead, organic, matter, decomposers, release, carbon, back, to, the, atmosphere, and, facilitate, nutrient, cycling, by, converting, nutrients, stored, in, dead, biomass, back, to, a, form, that, can, be, readily, used, by, plants, and, other, microbes, a, population, is, the, group, of, organisms, of, the, same, species, that, occupies, an, area, and, reproduce, from, generation, to, generation, population, size, can, be, estimated, by, multiplying, population, density, by, the, area, or, volume, the, carrying, capacity, of, an, environment, is, the, maximum, population, size, of, a, species, that, can, be, sustained, by, that, specific, environment, given, the, food, habitat, water, and, other, resources, that, are, available, the, carrying, capacity, of, a, population, can, be, affected, by, changing, environmental, conditions, such, as, changes, in, the, availability, of, resources, and, the, cost, of, maintaining, them, in, human, populations, new, technologies, such, as, the, green, revolution, have, helped, increase, the, earth, s, carrying, capacity, for, humans, over, time, which, has, stymied, the, attempted, predictions, of, impending, population, decline, the, most, famous, of, which, was, by, thomas, malthus, in, the, 18th, century, a, community, is, a, group, of, populations, of, species, occupying, the, same, geographical, area, at, the, same, time, a, biological, interaction, is, the, effect, that, a, pair, of, organisms, living, together, in, a, community, have, on, each, other, they, can, be, either, of, the, same, species, intraspecific, interactions, or, of, different, species, interspecific, interactions, these, effects, may, be, short, term, like, pollination, and, predation, or, long, term, both, often, strongly, influence, the, evolution, of, the, species, involved, a, long, term, interaction, is, called, a, symbiosis, symbioses, range, from, mutualism, beneficial, to, both, partners, to, competition, harmful, to, both, partners, every, species, participates, as, a, consumer, resource, or, both, in, consumer, resource, interactions, which, form, the, core, of, food, chains, or, food, webs, there, are, different, trophic, levels, within, any, food, web, with, the, lowest, level, being, the, primary, producers, or, autotrophs, such, as, plants, and, algae, that, convert, energy, and, inorganic, material, into, organic, compounds, which, can, then, be, used, by, the, rest, of, the, community, at, the, next, level, are, the, heterotrophs, which, are, the, species, that, obtain, energy, by, breaking, apart, organic, compounds, from, other, organisms, heterotrophs, that, consume, plants, are, primary, consumers, or, herbivores, whereas, heterotrophs, that, consume, herbivores, are, secondary, consumers, or, carnivores, and, those, that, eat, secondary, consumers, are, tertiary, consumers, and, so, on, omnivorous, heterotrophs, are, able, to, consume, at, multiple, levels, finally, there, are, decomposers, that, feed, on, the, waste, products, or, dead, bodies, of, organisms, on, average, the, total, amount, of, energy, incorporated, into, the, biomass, of, a, trophic, level, per, unit, of, time, is, about, one, tenth, of, the, energy, of, the, trophic, level, that, it, consumes, waste, and, dead, material, used, by, decomposers, as, well, as, heat, lost, from, metabolism, make, up, the, other, ninety, percent, of, energy, that, is, not, consumed, by, the, next, trophic, level, in, the, global, ecosystem, or, biosphere, matter, exists, as, different, interacting, compartments, which, can, be, biotic, or, abiotic, as, well, as, accessible, or, inaccessible, depending, on, their, forms, and, locations, for, example, matter, from, terrestrial, autotrophs, are, both, biotic, and, accessible, to, other, organisms, whereas, the, matter, in, rocks, and, minerals, are, abiotic, and, inaccessible, a, biogeochemical, cycle, is, a, pathway, by, which, specific, elements, of, matter, are, turned, over, or, moved, through, the, biotic, biosphere, and, the, abiotic, lithosphere, atmosphere, and, hydrosphere, compartments, of, earth, there, are, biogeochemical, cycles, for, nitrogen,

excessive, rates, of, extinction, and, the, erosion, of, biotic, interactions, it, is, concerned, with, factors, that, influence, the, maintenance, loss, and, restoration, of, biodiversity, and, the, science, of, sustaining, evolutionary, processes, that, engender, genetic, population, species, and, ecosystem, diversity, the, concern, stems, from, estimates, suggesting, that, up, to, 50, of, all, species, on, the, planet, will, disappear, within, the, next, 50, years, which, has, contributed, to, poverty, starvation, and, will, reset, the, course, of, evolution, on, this, planet, biodiversity,
